The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. ’
, public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
Ihe Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
mpre or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily anc
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
I thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus
tralian journal which, throughout its career, ha
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Iris!
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of nationa
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise ol
any human authority which has not been grantee
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast.mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

A. M. HAST, 49 ELIZABETH ST., ME LB.
Dear Bulletin, —Your reference to Dr,
Kerr’s nugget, or specimen, the first found up
Bathurst way, awakens ancient memories. Tlit
doctor was being shown, by some of his men, a
few quartz-specimens carrying gold freely, when
the blackfellow (“ Tommy,” I think he was called)
joined them. Dr. Kerr, turning to the neu
coiner, said, “You know what?’’ at the same
time pointing to the shining metal. “ No. What
name that peller?” was the darkey’s reply.
“ That’s gold, Tommy. Plenty money that
fellow,’’ said Kerr. “I know where budgeree
peller like that sit down, big as bullock’s cobbra,
the black remarked, as he eyed the stone indiffer-
ently. Tommy’s words made some impression on
his master, who kept his eye on the native, till,
some time after, a favourable opportunity occur
ing, Kerr questioned the blackfellow more closely
concerning his find. Tommy rode out with his
master and showed the specimen sticking out on
the surface, but joined to stone underneath. Kerr
appropriated the gold and made the black a pre-
sent of a team of bullocks (Tommy was a first-
class bullock-driver) and a flock of sheep
Tommy thereupon put up a shanty at
Louisa Creek and started butchering, and
he and his lubra lived at the shop. But it
was nob many days before the whole tribe of
blacks, to which Tommy and his lubra belonged,
camped around the establishment, and a wild
orgie commenced that only terminated with the
consumption of the flock of sheep, team of bul-
locks and the darkey’s happiness. When Tommy
first opened the business things boomed amazingly.
Many sheep were killed, sold and paid for; but,
when the tribe pitched their gunyahs near every-
thing was altered, and the business was always
too drunk to attend to and look after its own
interests. Diggers who went for mutton had to
catch and kill the sheep, while many took the
animal away alive. These latter seldom paid for
their meat. Things went on thus till one day the
opposition butcher bought the balance of the
flock. That night a wild corroboree commenced,
and ran on till the cash was done and the liquor-
supply out off—ere which melancholy consum-
mation poor Tom, blase with the enjoyment
his wealth had so lavishly provided, left
the gay and festive scene and went to
seek his wife, but nob finding her he retired
to his bed. In the morning, when Tom’s
lubra (she had been away administering consola-
tion to a poor countryman who had lately lost his
wife in the flood) went to her doss, she found
another woman in company with her “ola man.”
Loud were the yells and shrieks that broke upon
the morning air at this discovery of her husband’s
perfidy. All the blacks that were not too drunk
to crawl gathered round the dwelling, some sym-
pathising with the wronged wife, while others,
who knew where she had been, smiled at the
coincidence. In the tumult Tom awoke and,
seeming to understand the state of affairs at a
glance, picked up a butcher’s cleaver that lay by
and struck his lady-love—l don’t mean his wife—
several times on the head, almost killing her.
During the day he was arrested and sent off to
Bathurst. As a rouseabout, Tommy was con-
sidered a first-class man, but as a financier he
proved himself an utter failure. —H.W.
The Bulletin’s par. re the heaven-in-
spired idea of the Church of England Congress
printing half a million portraits of its bishops for
distribution among English cottagers brings the
following from a correspondent. The Marist
missionaries to the Tokelau group once left a
Samoan teacher there, to reside on the island
(Nukunono). He was a dull, unimaginative man
and made bub few converts. One day a trader
came in to chat, and although nob a Catholic,
sought to cheer him up. Hanging on the wall
was a print illustrative of the martyrdom of P&re
Channel (killed on Fatuna in ’47) and depicting
the murdered missionary ascending to heaven
escorted by a retinue of angels. The print was
old, faded and yellow with age and exposure.
“ If you had a new one in colours—bright colours —
and put it outside your house instead of keeping
it inside, these natives would come and look at it;
then you could talk to them and tell them what it
meant, and then you will get them interested in
your lota (religion)," said the trader. The teacher
shook his head. That was his one picture and he
wasn’t likely to ever get another. However, the
trader was going to Samoa and he promised to see
what he could get there. Taking the print with
him to Samoa, as a guide for a better picture, he
called upon a man with a local reputation as an
artist (painting sign-boards, etc.). When he went
back to Nukunono he took with him a picture
3ft. x 3ft. There was the ascending missionary
surrounded by a large flock of gaudy angels, most
of whom were playing furiously on concertinas and
accordeons ; some carried a string of flying-fish,
others baskets of taro and bundles of twist tobacco
and pipes, and one in the van humped what was
intended to represent a 501 b. keg of beef ; in fact,
everyone carried some kind of edible. Overhead
was depicted the Kingdom of Heaven, a large flat
place with a number of cocoanut trees bearing
ooooanuts as big as the keg of beef aforesaid, and
beneath a number of women preparing ovens for
the food being conveyed thither by the angels.
Sitting in a row were a number of white-bearded i
old men (all coloured brown like the other persons,
to be in accordance with the idea of a purely Tok-
elau heaven) who gazed stolidly at the approaching
visitors. The teacher unpacked the picture and
put it in the hitherto-unvisited little church. In
two hours the whole population surged round and
pushed each other down to get a better view while
the teacher improved the occasion. In three days
he had made fifty converts and it was only a
matter of a few weeks before the whole island was
baptised en masse.
By the Sea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Day is at noon, and a cloud,
A glory of snowy rings,
Over the city is bowed,
Poised on ethereal wings,
Like a stainless spirit and proud,
Scorning earthly things.
The sea is about my feet,
Folding in shallow waves
Musio as sad and sweet
As a bruised spirit craves,
Like voices when angels meet
Over children’s graves.
But the flower of my soul’s content—
Not the cloud, nor the sea,
With all their loveliness blent,
Can -restore unto me—
For the flower of my soul with its scent
Is with thee —with thee.

“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
This is the lay of the loafers gay,
The song of the idle crew ;
Tim Anthem of Hope to that lazy throng,
The crowd who but spit and chew.
Oh ! jolly and sweet is the life we pass,
_ g aiJ y the hours go by,
vVith never a thought of work undone
To summon us hatefully.
And who would slave in a cramped-up room,
Or sweat in some ill-lit den,
W hen the lamp of heaven awaits without
To lighten the lives of men ?
Why blame the love of freedom and ease f
Why censure the hate of work ?
We only follow our views of life
Our ingrained gospel of “ Shirk.”
So lazily live, my brother drones,
And then (not lazily) die;
Our only home God’s earth of green,
Our only roof the sky.
A DOMATNER.
EPILOGUE; BY AN UNDOMAINER.
Just so, gay loafer ! Why should you sweat
For the privilege of a crust ?
I would I could live like you, you bet,
But I’m married and—“ I must.”
That work is noble is rankest bosh,
The idle man never gets hurt;
Why need you worry to dress and wash
Since ease is a matter of dirt ?
Why need you toil when cadging is clear,
And gratis the gift of “ weed,”
And I am the greeny who buys your beer,
And parts for the price of a “feed.”
Lie low, sing high, and mock at the wrath
Of the men who disturb your wool ;
May your pint never lack its head of froth,
And the bowl of your pipe keep full.

Melbourne paper : “ Candidates for the
police force must remember that they are ex-
pected to be good runners.” Do they expect the
burglars to chase the policemen, then ?
On last Shrove Tuesday—the academical
day for such ceremonies—not one divine went up
for the degree of B.D. or D.D. in Trinity College,
Dublin. Up till *9l these degrees were purchase-
able in that University, but since then they can
only be gained by examination. Hence, in ’94, no
one. In ’91 —the last of the purchase years—there
was a terrible crush for the degrees; and those
curious in these matters will therefore be able to
value the pretentious clerical scholar by running
down the date of his displayed advt.
A Maoriland policeman writes to the
papers giving away some of the methods of the
force. One of his stories is interesting. An old
man—a very old man in a harmless state of
lunacy—escaped out of an asylum, and started on
the tramp. Three vast constables were sent after
him, and they presently found their aged prey
beaming placidly in a ditch and thinking of
nothing at all. He raised no objection whatever,
and one of the policemen arrested him with one
hand without the slightest difficulty, and the pro-
cession started for home, but on the way the
“ coppers ” got up a friendly wrestling-match, and
a rib was broken in the confusion. This was
where the trouble came in, for it was necessary
to show that the policeman Lad been bashed
and maimed in the execution of his duty in
order to get medical expenses and sick pay
out of the Government, So the three officers
solemnly reported how the grey-headed wreck
there present in custody had gone for them with
a pole and banged them horribly before lie could
be captured and disarmed, and the party got a
present of .£6 6s. for its “ bravery, tact, and dili-
gence.” And the average police-inspector is so
accustomed to believing tough statements that
even the sight of the little, aged prisoner who was
smiling affably at all the world and trying without
much success to count his own two legs didn’t
raise a doubt about the story.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Kassmussen’s advt. on page

SATURDAY, APRIL 2fi, 1894.
Example and Precept.
All Governments prescribe virtue to their
peoples. In Europe, within the last hundred
years, the application of the death sentence
has been limited about a hundred fold. But
the murderer is still murdered, the thief, the
ravisher, the perjurer, and persons guilty of
other anti-social offences are degraded and
imprisoned. Civil authority alleges the
common interest as justification for its penal
codes, and the various Priesthoods endorse
the acts of authority with ecclesiastical bless-
ings. Still villainy in all its developments
continues unabated after countless centuries
of such repression. Crime modifies its
detail, and accommodates its forms to meet
the times. But it is only its quality which
varies. Its quantity remains unaffected. It
would be very odd if the facts were other-
wise. The State expects and demands that
all its component parts shall be virtuous,
while itself continues in its corporate capa-
city to violate every moral law and to practise
every infamy. The loftier its pretensions
the more atrocious are its hypocrisy and its
villainy. The monarch and the statesmen,
in effect, demand, and seem to expect, that
society shall reform itself from the bottom
and by atoms while the upper layers exist
upon corruption and diffuse it through
every tissue of the general orga ism. The
individual must personally be virtuous
on pain of punishment, but the aggre-
gation of individuals, known as a nation,
may wallow in every iniquity. The
two positions are utterly incompatible.
Where precept and practice are at variance—
where the excellence of virtue is inculcated
while the teacher owes his position to suc-
cessful rascality—little result can accrue
from his moralisings.
• # »
If history were honestly recorded and
candidly taught to the young it would be the
most pernicious study which could engage
their attention. The story of the rise and
fall of dynasties and of nations is like the
Lord’s Prayer read backwards, or a series of
melodramas reversed. The devil is raised
every time, and the bold, bad villain triumphs
without fail in the last act. Often, indeed,
all the leading characters are villains, and
the interest consists in their struggles for
pre-eminence. In such cases it is usually the
boldest and worst villain who prevails, and
the curtain falls on the Church, in the
character of the virtuous heavy father,
bestowing a blessing on the atrocious hero,
while the stage is littered with the corpses of
victims and resounds with the jubilations of
his accomplices and the anxious acclamations
of sycophants and fools. It is not to be
wondered at that individuals and organisa-
tions have proclaimed themselves to be
at war with society. Such proclama-
tion they are logically justified in regard-
ing as discharging them from every
moral obligation, since their masters
and pastors habitually so regard it.
‘Thou shalt not kill !” Thus, peremptorily,
pronounce the Law and Prophets. “ Unless
you are at war ” is a qualification which the
State insinuates and the Church defers to.
“I am at war—with society,” the outlaw
and assassin declares, and has a logical right
to complain thbt when he has killed some of
the enemy he is hanged instead of being
presented with a medal, a vote of thanks,
and a pension. “ Thou shalt not steal !”
Excellent maxim ! The practical observance,
however, reminds of Lord Chesterfield’s
fatherly counsel to his son : “ You must not
lie. But should circumstances render it
necessary to lie, lay your hand upon your
heart, and say, ‘ upon your honour.’” And
so on throughout the Decalogue. The laws
of England punished adultery during the
reign of Charles 11., while that illustrious
monarch was originating several distin-
guished houses of the “nobility” of Great
Britain. There were similar laws in force,
and in operation too, in France, while
Louis XY. was amusing himself with the
beauties collected in the Parc aux Cerfs. It
was regarded as infamous and cowardly to
strike a woman, and snatching a lady’s purse
would bring a man to the gallows anywhere
in Europe when Frederick Ik of Prussia
made a dash with 50,000 men to tear Silesia
from the Empress Maria Theresa at a time
when he judged she was an unprotected
female.
* # *
Nothing so embellishes a character as
truthfulness and integrity, according to the
code of honour. Yet the functions of a
national representative in a foreign country
are so antagonistic to such sentiment that
mankind chuckles appreciatively over the
epigram that an ambassador is a State officer
who “ lies ” abroad for the good of his
country. Forgery and fraud are the stinking
vices of the despicable rogue. Yet the
forgery of a British admiral’s name—a name
representing the nation—by Clive, preceded
and hastened his elevation to the peerage,
and the high-minded sailor who had indig-
nantly refused to degrade the nation by
attaching his name to a fraudulent document
enthusiastically declared, after the swindle
had been successful and had brought him
some £50,000 of plunder, that the forger
was the finest fellow in existence. The syn-
dicate of trading adventurers who stole half
of Hindostan became “the Honourable”
Company. No other company had ever
been so distinguished, or had stolen so
mightily. Had any individual member of
that historical guild been caught taking a
purse on Hounslow Heath, he would have
hanged at Tyburn. History confers the
title of Great upon a few men. Everyone
so distinguished was a robber on a large
scale, and a wholesale spiller of blood
and promoter of arson. Le Grand
Monarque stole from all his neighbours.
The great Turenne, at his instance,
swept the entire Palatinate with fire and
sword, consuming in one sheet of flame cities
and hamlets, and creating, where a thriving
province had been, a wilderness covered with
ashes and ruins and peopled with corpses in
lieu of men, women and children. The
Great Peter, the Great Frederick, the
Great Napoleon, Alexander, Caesar, Gen-
ghis—the measure of all their greatness was
the immensity of their stealings and the vast-
ness of their murders. But it is not mur-
derers and robbers—that is to say, generals
and conquerors—only who derive terms of
approbation from their iniquities. The rule
is equally applicable in most other walks of
life. Talleyrand and Mbtternich, two
eminent masters of diplomacy, dissected, are
but two monumental liars and cheats, en-
dowed with a devil’s gift of dexterity in
swindling and imposture. Fouche, the
greatest of Police ministers, investigated,
proves to be merely a scoundrel of suoreme
artfulness, transcending in rascality any
individual whom his officers ever haled to
prison. “To deal with bad people,” re-
marked that imbecile, George 111., “it is
necessary to e uploy bad men,” that being
his excuse for making a Minister of the
Earl of Sandwich, a man reeking from the
orgies of Medmenham.
• • #
But, it may be objected, these are old
stories. Their application to present con-
ditions is not apparent. States no longer
mock private citizens by demanding virtue
while they practise vice. Sovereigns do not
now sign death-warrants for criminals whose
lives are better than their own. People are
not now-a-days required to join in adulation
of princes who pursue practices for which
persons of private station are justly sen-
tenced to infamy and sequestration. Is this
so 1 How many princes of Europe are known
to have committed bigamy, openly, fla-
grantly, simply calling it by another name—
Morganatic marriage ? If private citizens of
Belgium pursued the same career as the
Royal local imrnolator of English girls,
would the gaols have accommodation for
them ? By what words will the Re-
cording Angel express the dealings of
the French nation with Siam, and the British
with Egypt and Matabeleland ? When the
landless vagabond, peering over the park
railings of some noble’s domain, hoarsely
spouts to his fellows that if he could have
his will he would despoil the owner of the
property because he could turn it to more
advantageous use, a hundred moralists of
the classes wrathfully denounce his senti-
ments as subversive of order and as shame-
lessly criminal. Yet, these sentiments are
precisely identical with the arguments
habitually employed to extenuate and justify
the action of nations in expelling aboriginal
owners from huge portions of the world’s
surface. It is thus, mainly, that the parti-
tion of Africa is defended.
• * «
While nations steal and murder, it is vain
to hope that individuals will refrain. The
example is too emphatic and too comprehen-
sive to be without influence. The keener
the intelligence of the people the more
clearly they appreciate the immoral con-
veyed. While they are told that it is wrong
to steal and cheat and murder, and that
violation of the prohibition against these
crimes will surely involve them in destruc-
tion, they learn that these are offences only
punishable when committed on a small scale,
and that the true interpretation is not that
it is ruinous to commit them, but that while
they are dangerous when ventured in detail,
they are attended with enormous advantages
when perpetrated on a sufficiently large
scale. To be Wholesale is to be Respectable,
A Sunday Trade Union.
Ten years ago, lecturers were driven off the
Sunday platform in Sydney, and now the
parsons have banded together to outlaw the
Sunday musician. No attempt was ever made
to show that the lecturers were injuring the
public by their teachings. Men like Tyerman,
Bright, Denton, Gerald Massey, Moncure
Conway, Stout, Proctor, and others who at
various periods occupied the rostrum, taught
at least as high an order of morality as is
commonly served out from the pulpit. Their
sole fault was that they competed—and that,
too, successfully—with the churches. They
spoke to men of the day of a dispensation in
accord with contemporary science, and so it
happened that thinking people preferred to
pay to hear them rather than suffer, gratis, a
millionth repetition of “the old, old story,” with
its accompaniment of hell fire for independent
souls, and crowns of glory for sycophants. It
is the same with the musician. The prize fool
has yet to be discovered who will soberly assert
that a concert of sweet and enjoyable sounds
is a bad thing per se. On any night of the
week, from the second to the seventh, it is not
merely tolerated, but enjoyed, by persons who
term themselves “society,” and who go
on Sunday, some of them, to listen
to the winnings of a chartered proser—
not because they like him, but because church-
going is deemed the “ proper thing ” for well-
dressed people on the first day of the week.
The reason for the condemnation of the Sun-
day concert is identical with that which brought
about the extinction of the Sunday lecture. It
competes with the pulpit. Congregations are
steadily decliningin bulk,andare composed more
and more exclusively of devotees in bonnets ;
and the agonising question—“ Why do not the
men attend church?” is being asked with ever-
increasing anxiety. If Sunday is allowed to be-
come a day of reasonable gladness, if well-
lighted halls and theatres open their doors to
the multitude, otherwise relegated to an aimless
promenade of darkened streets or the back par-
lours of third-rate pubs., if, in brief, the people
are conceded a fair measure of Nineteenth
Century liberty, young men and respectable
girls may meet each other without loss of caste
in other places than where sermons are drawled
out, and t he sermonisers will have an even worse
time of it than they at present experience.
* * *
The onslaught on the Sunday concert-givers,
then, to which the perplexing Premier Dibbs
seems for the moment to have committed him-
self, is a question of trades unionism, pure
and simple. Parsons do not relish freedom of
contract when it cuts into their collection-
plates. And, as they dare not speak out their
full sentiments, they exhibit the insufferable
meanness of sheltering themselves behind a
miserable subterfuge. They do not assail the
concerts as mischievous in themselves. They
do not pretend that a song or a symphony
which is innocent on Monday, becomes a guilty
thing, fit only to be suppressed by the police,
if rendered on the preceding evening. If they
did, they know that every layman would laugh
at them. So they protest against a charge for
admission being made at the door, and call up
the ghost of a musty old law abhorred by all live
people of enlightened minds, to terrify the
reluctant civil authority into action. Of course
they are aware that concerts worth hearing can
only be carried on so long as they are paid for,
and that the trade spirit of the Age, of which
they themselves are shining exemplars, is so
pronounced that the mass of people will not pay
for anything which they can have for nothing.
Concerts, unlike creeds, cannot support them-
selves by offering policies of insurance against
eternal fires as a set-off to present premiums.
They are plain, straightforward commercial
enterprises, so much good music for so much
good coin, and with no incantation lottery for
the elect super-added. Free admission kills
them, as a matter of course, and the parson
wants to kill them, though he shrinks from
striking an honest blow. They compete with
him for Sunday patronage, injure his prestige
and reduce his income, and so he forms a union
of preachers and their abettors to drive the
interloper out of the market.
• * *
Apart from this trade rivalry, who has a word
to say against the Sunday concert ? Not the
police. They know right well that just in pro-
portion as the Sunday fetters are withdrawn,
the Monday morning charge-sheet diminishes.
The Sunday art gallery, museum, public library,
excursion, lecture-room and concert-hall are so
many agencies which militate against larrikin-
ism and ruffianism, by offering a rational means
of spending a few pleasant hours on the Wle
day of the week. Throughout America and the
continent of Europe, Sunday brings no additional
work to the police, because the people are allowed
to enjoy themselves pretty well in their own
way, and prefer to enjoy themselves in a reason-
able, sensible manner. Nor is there anyone in
authority here who, we venture to affirm, would,
if left to his own unwarped judgment, move a
finger to suppress the Sunday concert, any
more than he would close the Art Gallery or
Public Library. It is the opposing trade that
does it, helped, in ghoul-like fashion, by the
hands of dead men. Because, in a far-away
land, at a time when a festive monarch was
busily engaged launching fresh lines of aris-
tocracy with the help of an orange-girl, servile
legislators laid down the limits of Sunday
traffic ; or, at a later date, when Sunday clubs
met to discuss the wisdom of continuing to be
ruled by a madman, a British Parliament
passed an Act to protect the Lord’s Day, there
can be found no valid reason for preventing
Australian citizens from attending a musical
entertainment if they are disposed to pay for
the privilege. If the first day of the week is to
have its restrictions, let them be our own
restrictions, not such as perhaps suited a remote
people who were eaten by the worms centuries
ago. We live in a bright, new land, sur-
rounded by sunny, airy influences unknown to
those dead folks, and surely possess suffi-
cient sense to frame our own rules of
living, and not allow ourselves, at the
dictation of priests, to grovel under the
mortmain of less enlightened ages. Life has
not so many joys for the ordinary run of man-
kind that they can afford to forego any of them
in order to bolster up the failing vocation of
clericism, which is founded on dead men’s words
and kept going by the help of dead men’s
statutes.
Individual versus Party.
We learn much of New South Wales Labour
representatives in Parliament, much of New
South Wales Labour delegates in conference,
and precious little of the New South Wales
Labour-party. The personal strife between
leaders of opposing factions has blotted out of
sight the interests of the voters who elected
them. On the eve of a general election, when
unity, concentration and organisation of forces
are above all things desirable, the officers
wrangle over pay and precedence, and the men
are in that state of indecision and perplexity
which is the certain preliminary of rout. And
this is the pass to which the “ success ” of the
Labour-party has brought us !
• • #
The Bulletin doesn’t care two straws who
represents the Labour-party, so long as the
Labour-party is thoroughly represented. It
their votes are not split by selfishness or
treachery, the electors may be relied upon to
return the best men available. Whether the
best man is named Brown, Jones, or Robin-
son, whether he has been in Parliament before
or not, matters very little, so long as he is the
best man, and has sufficient comprehension of
his duty to pull with the party, and not against
it. But unity, before and after the elections, is
essential to success. The present Labour repre-
sentatives have done much, but they have
done nothing like what was expected
from them, what was possible to them,
and chiefly because they were all so
competent (or incompetent) to command that
nobody cared to obey. Yet there is nothing
clearer than this, that if the Party is to succeed,
the individual must be sacrificed. He need not
sacrifice his independence or his conscience, but
he must sacrifice his self-love, his piques, his
jealousies, and his personal interests. Hitherto
New South Wales labour representatives have
shown themselves incapable of the sacrifice, and
hence their comparative failure
* * *
What is the quarrel now ? It is the old
quarrel between the Haves and the Have-nots,
between the Ins and the Outs, between the men
who enjoy pay, place and power and the men
who hunger—yes, it must be said, for it is so
obviously true—to enjoy them. Where does
the Party come in? Nowhere; it is a conflict
between individuals, each fighting for his own
hand. Smith the member, or Smith the dele-
gate, of course wishes that his constituency
should return a Labour representative. But he
wishes much more vehemently that the consti-
tuency should return him. Smith, as its Labour
representative. Smith is quite willing to re-
present Labour, but the thing of primary
importance is the representation of Smith. If
the Party indicates a preference for Jones,
perish the Party !
♦ * *
It seems queer that the Labour representa-
tives in Parliament, who owe their election to
the Labour Leagues, should address their
manifesto, not to the organisations of Labour- 1
voters which put them where they are, but to
“ the electors of New South Wales,” many of
whom tried hard with vote and influence to
prevent them from getting where they are.
They appeal from “ the unrepresentative,
proxy-packed, and largely-self elected Confer-
ence,” not to the Labour Leagues who elected
both themselves and the delegates to the Con-
ference, but to “ the democratic voters of
the country.” That is to say, the Labour-
members propose to waste all the fruit
of the organisation of the past five years,
because they fear that this fruit, formerly
enjoyed by themselves, may now be plucked by
others. They break with the leagues which
have elected them, relying on the personal
influence which their election has gained them.
They kick away the stool on which they have
climbed to power, because they think that
power has made them secure without it. They


a re no longer Labour members, united in a
Labour-party, and wo are back again in the
happy state of things before a Labour-party
existed, when everybody played a lone hand,
and the devil took the hindmost democrat.
• • •
The pledge, vague and impracticable, would
no w appear to be a mere pretext. On
other grounds it is useless, since the straight
man will go straight without a pledge,
and the crooked man will go crooked in spite
of the pledge. Precautions after election
are wasted. All that can be done is to take
precautions before election, make the best pos-
sible choice, and let every mistake teach how
to make a better choice next time. But if the
Labour members were dissatisfied with the
pledge, why did they not appeal from those
grotesquely self-seeking persons, the league
nominees, to the leagues to whom they also owe
allegiance? If they wish to maintain the
Labour-party, why refer the dispute to the
classes outside the Labour-party ? Because, it
would really seem, they distrust the issue, and
prefer rather to wreck the Party than their indi-
vidual chances of re-election. What is the use of
labour-leagues and labour-organisation at all if
the Parliamentary representative members of
the leagues, nominated and elected by the
leagues, choose, at the end of every three years’
term, to throw the leagues overboard and
“appeal to the country ? ”
« • •
A priori, the present representatives of the
Labour-party in Parliament are probably a far
better all-round set of men than any who can
he found to take their place. The reason is
that they have had the benefit of three years’
parliamentary education. They know their
own ignorance far better than those who seek
to supplant them know theirs. Three years
ago their notions of government were just as
crude as those of which to-day they deplore the
advocacy by the new men. But between the
men of three years ago and the men of to-day
there is a great gulf fixed. The Labour repre-
sentatives to-day are mostly wiser and better
men than they were three years ago. Surely
the Labour electors may be trusted to see this.
If the Labour-representatives were loyal to the
Party, they would cheerfully submit themselves
to the decision of the Party. But they fear the
issue of a referendum ; and hence their mani-
festo, not to the Party but “ to the country ”
* * *
The pledge is a mistake and should be frantuy
acknowledged as a mistake. Just as obvious is
toe mistake of seeking to supplant an old
representative by a new one, where the former
retains the confidence of a majority of Labour
(lectors. It cannot be conceded fora moment that
there is any vested interest in the Parliamen-
tary representation of Labour. The member
who is a failure must take the penalty of failure.
If he refuses, he must be fought as a traitor to
the cause. But where an old man has done
well, it is neither just nor expedient to prefer a
new man on the chance that he may be better.
The point is to win the election. If it is toler-
ably certain that the old representative can do
that, let him be unanimously supported, and
et the would-be new representative go and
conquer another constituency from the enemy.
Yet it is plain that, old or new, if a man aspires
to be called a Labour representative, he must
bow to the decision of the majority of
Labour electors, which can only be ascertained
through a’plebiscite of the Labour League con-
cerned. If, in spite of a majority against him,
he fights the election and splits the Party, he
must be denounced without hesitation, and
opposed without mercy. The success of the
individual is nothing : the success of the Party
is everything. The Labour Leagues must
separately decide who shall represent them,
and let minority work with majority to make
the decision final. For without the Leagues
there can be no Party, without a Party no
unity, without unity no success. /
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Protection’s True Purpose.
The stupid old adage that it is possible to have
too much of a good thing, has been laid hold of
by the “moderate tariff” party in Victoria,
and a flood of illogical reasoning threatens to
sweep awajf the important distinction between
duties that protect industries and taxes that
chiefly work for the protection of Government
revenue. A prohibitive tariff in the case of
foreign boots, hats, haberdashery, and all
articles that can be, and are, efficiently manu-
factured on the spot must benefit the country
more than the moderate tariff which allows
thousands of superior people to get their boots
from abroad, paying a fee to Government oh
each pair. The shopkeeper profits no more by
selling British boots than by selling Victorian
ditto, so he doesn’t come within the range of
argument. Say the revenue now gets ss. out
of the imported boots for which the purchaser
pays 30s. fie could buy an equally serviceable
pair of “ colonial-made ” feet coverings for 255.
if there were a prohibitive taififf to stimulate
competition and manufacturing art in the local
trade. The odd five shillings would not be lost to
the State if it remained in his pocket, whilst
the sovereign would unquestionably be devoted
to the support of labour here instead of else-
where. fience the capitalistic cry that Pro-
tection is “overdone” in Victoria can only
justify itself by means of the partial fact that
certain goods have become dearer without any
material increase of local production. It is for
want of full protective encouragement that
there are not more bootmakers, more competi-
tion, more skilful handicraft, and more value
for one’s money in the land. To cheapen the
cost of living in Australia there was no need
for starvation wages and human degradation.
“ e want labour to cheapen itself by acquiring
more skill and cunning, the result of com-
petition which can be secured by the
raising 0 f a H genuine protective duties.
Hitherto the Protection policy of Victoria
has subordinated to the Treasurer’s hunger
mr Customs receipts. Manufacturers were
encouraged to make certain goods, but a
large importation of similar goods was being
looked for and prayed for by the Government
at the same time. Each successive Ministry
has bowed to the opponents of direct taxation
instead of keeping things square by mulcting
Fat Man of the equivalent of the very sum
which he pays as duty upon goods that should
never be imported at all. Let the former
Customs revenue from goods, shut out by a
prohibitive tariff, be replaced by direct taxation
of the class that preferred to pay high duties
upon the imported article rather than buy the
“ colonial make.” Even Fat Man can’t detect
any injustice in the idea. He voluntarily pays
a ss. fee for the privilege of wearing foreign
boots and so forth. Force him to save the ss.
of indirect taxation, and then make direct
application for the two half-crowns.
To “ Oblige ” the Jury.
Re the plundering of the public by their trusted
servant, the Law, it was recently stated in The
Bulletin —“lmportant suits are hung up, to
the great mental and financial distress of
litigants, and the ‘ usual adjournment over
Saturday ’ is, in at least one case out of
every five, a scandalous shame.” A few
hours after the publication whereof, there
arose a question as to whether a Victorian
Court should attempt to hasten the climax of
Hayes v. Australasian libel-case by dis-
pensing with the usual adjournment aforesaid.
On the Thursday afternoon, Chief Justice
Madden blandly enquired if it would be pos-
sible to conclude the case on the following day,
an apparently childish question to put, seeing
that the examination of witnesses had not then
concluded, and the speeches of counsel, not
to mention his Honor’s summing up, would
inevitably be long. Purves, Q. 0., hazarded an
opinion that the case could not be concluded on
Friday, whilst Duffy, for plaintiff, begged to
know whether the Court proposed to sit on
Saturday. The public ought to be well aware,
although they are probably hazy on the subject,
that the Court does as it chooses with regard to
the occupants of the jury-box. An empanelled
juryman finds his attempts to excuse himself
from duty sternly swept away by the Judge.
There are pains and penalties to be visited upon
the lay citizen who absents himself when called
upon, and in effect a juryman is made a slave of
the Court until the case he has to give an
opinion upon is finally disposed of. The jury
must sit on Saturday if his Honor so determine.
Therefore, it was as humorous as usual to hear
Chief Justice Madden affect to relieve himself
of the responsibility for this particular adjourn-
ment by asking whether the jury would prefer
to come back on Saturday or Monday. The
foreman, being possibly a tradesman with his
little shop on his mind—it doesn’t matter what
he may have been—replied “ Monday.” So the
Chief Justice without a quiver of his learned
eyelid, said, “Then we will finish this case on
Monday, and I will adjourn the Criminal
Court,” after which the mob of lawyers gathered
up their papers and—it being then four o’clock
—gaily dispersed. The “ usual Saturday ”
suspension of business was arranged by the
legal trade, but it was made to appear
that the jury foreman had settled the matter,
whereas there are numerous precedents for
assuming that in the event of the foreman hav-
ing said “ Saturday, by all means,” his desire
for a speedy conclusion would have been over-
ruled by the objections of one or more counsel
present. In a word, the Court expected the
foreman to vote for a postponement into another
week, and he fulfilled anticipation. If anyone
doubts the absurdity of this solemn farce let
him consider what would happen to a jury who
expressed a wish to adjourn over a Friday and
sit on the Saturday instead. Then we could see
that a jury’s convenience is as naught to the
Law, unless the Law wishes to use it as a cloak
for one of the lawyers’ own time-honoured,
arbitrary customs.

Libel-law Lunacy.
The libel-action brought by jockey Jimmy
Hayes against the Australasian newspaper
has ended in a “ draw,” and each side pays its
own hundreds or thousands of pounds of costs.
This result is not much more unsatisfactory
than that of the first Speight v. the Age case
which was brought to a miserable termination
by a three-fourths verdict upon one out of
eleven separate counts. As regards the re-
maining ten-elevenths of the railway libel-suit
the jury failed to agree. Jockey Hayes pro-
ceeded on one count only, so the odds were 10
to 1 against a verdict considering that the
Judge’s summing-up was so vague and be-
fogging in the latter instance as in the former.
Before railing at these two notable examples
of jury incompetence—in both of which the
jury did certainly proclaim their dulness
through their foreman—it behoves one to read
the charge of the respective judges to the men
they are popularly supposed to guide and
direct. Then there appears to be much excuse
for the lack of common determination shown
by the representatives of Liberty’s palladium.
The guidance and direction vouchsafed by Jus-
tice Hodges to his jury, and by Chief Justice
Madden to his jury, were equally perplexing
and provocative of a conflict of opinion. Both
juries were given to understand that damaging
newspaper statements, if unproved, would con-
stitute a libel on the damaged party ; also, both
juries were informed that a libel might be fair
comment, under which circumstance it was not
libellous, and neither jury could possibly derive
a distinct understanding of fair comment from
the Judge’s definition of the legal meaning of
the term. Judge Hodges, in the Speight case,
succeeded in fuddling nine jurymen until they
found that statements could be libellous,
untrue, and fair comment at one and the
same time. Judge Madden’s success in
the same direction was made clear by the
foreman, who enquired of him : “ Supposing
the jury agree to a verdict that the particulars
are not proven, but agree that it was fair com-
ment formed on insufficient knowledge without
malice, what would be the effect of such a ver-
dict?” When the learned Justice assured the
jury that such a finding would be “a perfectly
good verdict for the defendant ” they went
back to their room and finally decided not to
give a verdict of any description whatever.
Seemingly they, like the other lot of arbiters,
were fuddled by the “ fair comment ” enigma.
They might have agreed that the Austra-
lasian had with insufficient knowledge of
facts made statements which the evidence
failed to prove, but they could not agree as
to where fair comment began or ended.
Ere dismissing this non-productive jury,
their guide and director laid stress upon the
sorrow he felt for their failure to find a decision.
He might well have wept in open court over
this latest exhibition of costly folly in libel-
law as it is expounded to average mortals by
Victorian judges. A law more profitable to
lawyers and unprofitable to the public could
not have been invented to invite ridicule. An
interesting law to watch in its course through a
number of other libel-cases now pending. A
desirable kind of law, as far as newspapers are
concerned, and therefore not a law to be
despised in print. No intelligent, honest editor
would allow his paper to publish the damaging
statements of an untrustworthy contributor
upon any matter of public importance, and the
Law seems to suggest that fair comment is the
comment of a commentator who can show
reasonable cause for believing his comment to
be fair. But, perhaps, this ruling applies par-
ticularly to “ great ” journalism.

The Luck of Lazarus.
A London paper, professedly Radical in senti-
ment, has come to the comfortable conclusion
that to die from hunger is one of the best pos-
sible ways of effecting a decease. “Hunger,”
says the editor, “ is only an intimation that the
time has come for the recurrent meal. If the
meal does not come, the hunger passes away
and a lowering of the vital functions follows, as
the result of which, if the privation continues,
all sensation is deadened. By many of us the
stigma of pauperism, the fear of the workhouse,
is thought to be the restraining motive with
these poor people who give no hint to their
necessities, I believe the explanation to be
this, that under a course of privation they
really lose all desire to live, all initiative, all
sensation, physical or intellectual, and allow
themselves to die because it is the easiest and
pleasantest course.” Toryism, pure and simple,
could suggest no better excuse for leaving the
struggling poor to their fate. Feed a hungry
man and you fill him with a harassing desire to
get more vittles and live on. Chase the lean
petitioner from your doorstep and his hungerpre-
sently passes away, giving place to a sweet and
gentle lowering of his vital functions. He loses
all physical sensation of rats inside, and all
intellectual disposition to curse the existing
state of society, and, retiring to his heap of
dirty straw in the far corner of a damp cellar,
he chooses the pleasant course of pegging-out.
A beautiful expression lights up his protuberant
cheek-bones, and he makes an enviable depar-
ture to the Better Land. What an example for
Fat Man, who is apt to prolong his death-bed
sufferings by picking at sweetbreads and swill-
ing dry champagne 1 In his wealthy ignorance
he misses the happiness of following the easiest
course, and he probably chokes himself with an
oyster at the finish, instead of collapsing in an
enjoyable manner upon an emaciated stum-
mick. Positively, the poor have much to be
thankful for when they get nothing at all.
Mr. Richard Teece “had no hesitation in saying
that those who passed through Sydney University
were the minds which in the future would guide
the province and be the masters of its destiny.”
Mr, Teece shouldn’t be too sure. The state-
ment that a university, as a matter of neces-
sity, turns out “master minds” is not borne
out by experience. University ism is pedagogy ;
pedagogy is grooved ignorance. The university
system abhors originality and kills it wherever
possible. The average collegiate is merely a
learned pig who doesn’t understand how or why
he euchres his opponent. As a matter of fact,
he very often fails to euchre his opponent.
Somehow, the “master-minds of the com-
munity ” rarely get to the university. The
drones send their spawn to the universities,
and the spawn-entities develop into learned
fools, who gabble but don’t comprehend, who
become doctors that fill graveyards, lawyers
who damn cases, legislators who bungle laws,
financiers who ruin millions, and alleged
“masterminds” every one. It is astonishing
how little the university really does for the
strong man—the man who was born to fight
and to sharpen his sword on his own teeth.
But the social-caste stamp of the university is
invaluable to the weakling ; for to hold a
university degree is to have spats on your
mental boots, and to have the trousers of your
brain tucked up in public.
New South Wales Premier Dibbs’ Banking
Bills didn’t go quite so far as to make tram-
tickets legal tender, yet it is a common occur-
rence in provincial State schools, these hard times,
for three dilapidated “ trams ” to be tendered
in payment of the weekly school-fee. Under
the Act provision is made for scholars, whose
parents are unable to pay for their education,
being placed on the Exemption List. Many,
however, to whom the relief would be a god-
send, are unaware of the fact, and when unable
to pay the 3d. fee they keep their children at
home. Others, duly acquainted with the relief
clauses of the Act, steadily set their faces
against branding their children paupers. It is
the undemocratic system of payment for com-
pulsory State education which makes such a
stigma possible. Few people apply for
exemption from school-fees until absolutely
forced; which fact makes sad reading of
the late heavy returns under this head.
Another eloquent commentary on the times
is the ragged condition of a number of the
pupils who, awhile back, were well, even to
smartly, clad. Then further down the social
scale —the children of the poor —poor in times
which are known as “good,” and how im-
measurably poorer these dull days ! It is a
literal fact that many of these are sent to school
insufficiently fed. Small wonder, then, that
complaints are frequent in large schools of
lunches being stolen ! And when this happens
and the culprit is caught it is usual for him to
be caned before tlie whole school—presumably
as an awful warning against becoming hungry.
This is very like censuring God for having built
a boy with a stomach. Besides, it proclaims
the boy “Thief” before the whole school, and
children, like their elders, have a trick of living
up to an ugly name.
Editor Bulletin,— Perhaps one reason why
the housekeepers, mentioned by Paul Blunt
in yours of last week, preferred to deal with
Chinese vegetable-vendors is that, compared to
the average “ white” hawker, the heathen is a
gentleman. Don’t start, or think of justifiable
homicide 1 Did you ever observe the harmless
necessary John dealing with the “ missis ” or
the housemaid ? If you are not absolutely
blinded by prejudice, you cannot have failed to
observe the dignity with which he bears him-
self. He never (or very rarely) loses patience,
he bears each housewife’s little peculiarities of
taste carefully in mind; he is honest, punctual,
reliable; he never presents himself under the
influence of liquor, is never offensive in his
choice of language, and is, comparatively, cleanly
in person. Now, no true-hearted woman could
fail to appreciate these good qualities. And if
you add one great charm, which only an
observant male would notice, you will have the
full secret of John’s popularity. Every white
woman is a goddess in John’s eyes; and his
manner to her is as full of innocent admiration
as a child’s, as full of delicate chivalry as a
poet’s to his mistress. And this bearing of
admiration and respect is absolutely free from
the least touch of grossness. These are the
virtues which make John Chinaman popular
with women in the capacity of a hawker.
And then, every true-hearted woman is merci-
ful and humane. She hears John, her husband,
violently abusing Chinamen and charging them
with all sorts of faults and vices. She
looks at John, her hawker, and she has a
dim (or strong) perception of the truth. She
knows that her husband is a man, she
loves him and reveres his very failings—
but, in her illogical woman’s way, she is
kind to the victim of her man’s injustice
and race-prejudices. It is true that those pre-
judices are instinctive, necessary, and, viewing
the possibilities of the future, perhaps even
laudable. But the woman sees the human
being, and (let us thank God for it) her woman-
liness overpowers other considerations. Do you
remember the old story of our school-bag days
about the ancient negresswho succoured Mungo
Park, and under what circumstances ? Every
Chinaman in our midst is liable, in a measure,
to repeat the experiences of Park. —Yours, &c,,
Bill Sikes.
A long-drawn-out and perennially-recurrent
conflict has been waged at Broken Hill over
the question of holding a special audit of the
municipal accounts. Over a year ago a petition
demanding the audit, under section 184 of the
Municipalities Act, was forwarded to the
Sydney authorities. The council, ostensibly on
the score of economy, set itself to thwart the
movement. It was found that sufficient of the
signatories were non-ratepayers to reduce the
number of qualified petitioners below 50, the
minimum, and the two special auditors nomi-
nated by Government in terms of the petition,
who had travelled to Broken Hill from Sydney,
were refused access to the council’s books.
The next petition was similarly proved in-
formal. Meanwhile, the desire of the council
to burke the audit convinced numbers of rate-
payers, previously indifferent, of its necessity,
and the third petition was regular. The coun-
cil, as a dernier ressort, called a meeting which,
it was hoped, “ all citizens having the welfare
of the town at heart” would attend. They
did; the set motions were rejected, the Mayor
left the chair in disgust, and under a new chair-
man the meeting solemnly sanctioned the audit
and wired the special auditors to come along.
Also, it decided that the cost would be £lOl3
13s. (54 days, eight hours, at £1 Is. each
auditor per hour ! with travelling and hotel
charges ! 1), instead of £3734 (33 weeks, with
“ exes ”) as estimated by the council. The
municipality, which is already miserably stone-
broke and can afford neither sum, had recently
to dismiss all its day labourers consequent on a
sudden demand by its bankers for payment of
an unsecured overdraft. It is at present liqui-
dating this at the rate of £5OO monthly, and is
paying interest on another of £12,000. The
persistency of the demand for the audit is evi-
dence of the falling-off of popular faith in the
infallibility of the orthodox brand of auditor
consequent on recent financial revelations. In
this case the books of the council have been, as
usual, audited half-yearly by the annually-
elected officers. Revision may be necessary,
but the law which permits fifty ratepayers,
who may be stupidly obstinate or influenced by
persons having sinister motives, to harass a
stone-broke municipality to the extent of pay-
ing at the rate of £1 Is. per auditor per hour,
with expenses, for such revision is simply
monstrous.
The idea that God is an Englishman with a
preference for Englishmen and a yearning to
spend all his time in meddling with English
affairs, is rapidly going the way of all the other
crude blasphemies with which ignorant barbar-
ism has disfigured rational conceptions of deity.
It lingers in England, of oqurse; it will die
hard, no doubt; but its doom is nevertheless
sealed. “No man with a sense of humour ever
founded a religion ; ” and the obtrusive profes-
sors of piety are just as dense as the founders.
No one seems to have been struck with the
grotesque indecency of Queen Victoria’s action
in calling upon the “ Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost ” to help her as minor assistants at the
knighting of the hard-swearing ex-Republican
Dibbs. But this lately happened in England.
And when Justice Stephen sentenced burglars
Montgomery and Williams to death for
hurting a constable’s head, he either omitted
the customary shibboleth “ May God have
mercy on your soul,” or the papers omitted to
report it. The Bulletin hopes the former was
the case. Nine times out of ten the Judge
doesn’t believe that criminals have a soul, and
doesn’t care what becomes of the soul, if there
is a soul; and the hypocrisy of inviting the
Creator and Ruler of the Universe to save the
soul of the man whom, arrogating to yourself
the functions of God Almighty, you are cold-
bloodedly butchering, is indeed revolting hypo-
crisy.

346 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
April 25, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Q’sland society was lately somewhat astonished
when a lady whose stuccoed mansion adorns a
most irreproachable suburb, introduced her two
daughters into a law-court to defend a suit brought
by a fashionable milliner suing for about six
pounds. At the same time, though, the society
madam showed her acuteness in thus trotting the
dear girls into the witness-box, for the lawyer who
complained for plaintiff didn’t dare to cross-
examine two pretty maidens who had but to open
their eyes at him to reduce him to stammering
apologies, and, of course, plaintiff lost the case.
Had she thought to introduce two pretty mil-
liners into her side of the question, the battle
might have been waged for weeks. However,
six pounds versus leaving two youthful damsels
to the uncertain mercies of horsehair really looks
as if nowadays society thought quite as much of
its ducats, as of its daughter. Nevertheless and
notwithstanding, let the Right prevail.
I really didn’t mean to overlook the departure
of Captain W. H. St. Clair, R.N., who was
“senior naval officer in charge of the steam
reserves and naval establishments at Sydney
station ” —an arduous-sounding post, which, nath-
less, left its slave heaps of time to turn up at small
tea-parties in the afternoon, and take a working-
interest in private theatricals. I once saw him
play a bluff sort of r6le very well —if he had only
known what to do with his hat.
Anyhow, he has gone ’Ome, where all the good
officials go eventually, no matter how “ glorious ”
they find this country, and tars from the warships
dragged his vehicle to the railway-station, while
ignorant passers-by peered into the carriage to get
a glimpse of the bride —for there generally is a
scarlet-cheeked virgin on promotion in a circus of
that kind. Bub alone the oap’n departed, and
Sydney society is once more on the qui vive. The
authorities can’t shuffle Imperial officers often
enough—within a certain limit—to suit Australian
belledom on the matrimonial warpath.
Let us be joyful that the trustees of Sydney,
Melbourne, and Adelaide Art Galleries have
finally agreed to exchange their little stocks-in-
trade from time to time. Sydney, I am
sure, is more than willing to barter the
“Queen of Sheba” for “ Ulysses and the Sirens ”
with their hair blowing against the wind.
It is economical, too, for instead of waiting till
“ our London buyer ” has paid four figures for a
champion oleograph ere we can hope for novelty
in the catalogue, we will have movement on the
walls merely for the trouble of borrowing it.
Besides which, imagine the chances of somebody’s
brolly getting run through a few highly-coloured
canvasses that never would be missed as they
were en route? There could be no better way of
destroying the evidences of the utter lack of
discernment in Blank (trustee) than by arranging
with a porter to spill his gorgeously-framed
“national purchase” under the first available
gravel-train.
On dit that a Southern newspaper is about to be
sued for libel by the “society” wife of a boom-
ster. The lady in question, whose gowns have
frequently been detailed in the paper she
threatens (which, to my mind, fully accounts for
her implacableness), is perfectly sure of getting a
verdict. “My case is good in any of the Courts,”
she said, ecstatically, to a friend ; “I have danced
with all of the Judges !”
And therein lies another proof of how cosy a
billet it is to be a woman. Could the festive bank-
clerk but have a schottische with his Honor just
before the accounts went wrong, who knows how
slender his prison bars might be? And imagine
the effect g. previous polka might have on even the
sternest Judge ! The law can have few terrors for
a woman wiio readily remembers that the horse-
hair-swamped apparition seated severely on the
Bench had really such a nice way of holding one in
a waltz.
N.S.W. Horticultural Society’s ’Mum Show
happened at Sydney Town Hall, the other Thurs-
day, when Miss Duff was billed to make her first
appearance as a show-opener, and didn’t dis-
appoint the moist crowd that braved a wicked
barometer to see her do it. But like mamma like
daughter, and Miss Duff—looking as if death
were sweeter —backed up by her sisters and
governess and the Homeric Galton, merely
whispered to a blue-ribboned committee-man to
set the flowery proceeding going, and there was
an end to it.
It strikes me as being a stupid thing to yard
up a bread-and-butter miss just because she is the
Governor’s daughter and pose her before the
nation merely as another exhibit to attract the
general public and adorn the advts. If the
juvenile patroness could do more than twirl her
bouquet and look helpless there might be some
sense in offering her up in the absence of the usual
official martyrs, but as the hapless maiden is
on view merely as a gaping-stock and to appease
the vanity of committees, the whole thing looks
ridiculous. By-the-by, when “Miss Duff and
suite” entered the hall the National Anthem
blared forth, although the strict official etiquette
would have substituted some other entrance
music. People won’t learn that “Gorsave” is
sacred to His Ex. only because they’d rather not.
Any sprig of vice-royalty is a good enough excuse
to advertise the presence of Govt. House in the
neighbourhood with the sounding chords that
bring “loyal” audiences to their hind legs with a
jump.
Otherwise, the ’Mum show was done very well
this Autumn, though I rather think the followers of
Adam are sacrificing daintiness to abnormal dimen-
sions in these aromatic winter flowers. Size isn’t
necessarily beauty—except to Chinamen—and
why our gardeners should set themselves to work
to rear things which look like skye-terriers on
stalks and glow with pride in the presence of a
bloom straddles a soup-plate is folk-lore to
me. Evidently the ’mum isn’t meant for personal
adornment. I can’t think of anybody—barring
Johnny Lucas—who could sport one of these big,
bold blooms and have his boutonniere taken
seriously. But, stop!--yes, I do. He is a delight-
ful pianist, and, in point of figure, might be
Arthur Orton’s own brother.
City-organist Wiegand has nearly come to the
end of his tether as Grand Shah of Sydney’s big
organ, but there is no fear (or hope, as the crowd
of disappointed organ-grinders hungry for the
post would put it) of bis leaving Botany Bay to
the tender mercies of more or less brilliant local
talent. Mayor Manning has decreed that his
position is “ practically permanent;” therefore;
Wiegand we have always with us—bar accidents.
At the same time, I think other people might,
now and then, be allowed to play upon the un-
manageable instrument, if only to show who is
really master of it. Organist Best, the white-
fisted bon viveur, made the gigantic musical-box
sound like a riot in a tin tank, with occasional
intervals of asthmatic coughing, and disappointed
Sydney at the opening of the instrument.
Wiegand is the only person who has ever reduced
the big organ to melody—though the frozen-out
geniuses of Sydney will tell you that they haven’t
had the chance, of course. Apart from ttie artistic
aspect of Mons. Wiegand, he is also a financial
success. In 300 recitals he has made .£BOOO.
A second visit to the unvisited “Mrs. Tan*
queray No. 2,” at Sydney Lyceum, brings trifles
into prominence that one doesn’t notice to begin
with. For instance, it is a lucky thing that doors
take the place of portieres in the T. mansion,
because Mrs. T. is so addicted to banging ’em
that if she had to flounce out through silently-
drooping curtains her wrongs wouldn’t be half
appreciated by the feminine part of the house.
By the by, they say it is only a perfect Brute of
a husband who takes all the portals off their
hinges and hangs up noiseless rag instead, leaving
his helpless victim nothing to argue with.
A touch of nature in “Mrs. Tanqueray ” ia
where Mr. T. gently disappears from the scene in
the second act when the two women are quarrel-
ling. A man always flees from the feminine
hysterics to come even when he has raised the
whirlwind—which is, on the whole, the wisest
thing to do. People who intervene between a pair
of angry women generally achieve the fate of King
Laurent the Second, who receives Fiametta’s
blows meant for Bettina in his own “bread-
basket if I may lapse into the lingo of fistiana.
Australia isn’t thoroughly broken in to un-
alleviated misery in its theatrical moments—it
still secretly longs for the joyful denouement that
makes melodrama so supernatural. At “Mrs.
Tanqueray,” the other evening, I was amused at
a woman in my neighbourhood who settled her-
self comfortably for the two-minute wait—before
the last scene, and said complacently, “There’s a
lot to clear up in one act, isn’t there?” She
wanted Mrs. T. to appear as the guest of the
county by the simple, melodramatic explanation
at the eleventh hour that it was her twin sister
who navigated Peter Jermyn’s yacht, I suppose.
Or else there was lacking an apotheosis—Paula
going up into the flies in a stained-glass attitude
between two night-gowney angels with wadding
wings. Evidently naked realism isn't femininely
appreciated.
By the way, I am lost in admiration at the
staying powers of Mrs. Brough’s hair-pins. Not
one actress in a barrel-full could romp through
Mrs. T. (a r6le that, a well-known actress opined
to me, would take Bernhardt and Ellen Terry
rolled into one to strike electric sparks out of)
like Mrs. Brough does without one curl escaping.
Mrs. Potter’s hair—you remember—was always
between her teeth in moments of histrionic frenzy,
and Bernhardt’s golden tresses used to come down
as naturally as a washerwoman’s. Mrs. Bernard-
Beere’s scanty locks were always about to tumble,
and, somehow, one looks for loose love-locks in
the more frisky heroines of the drama. It may be
that Mrs. Brough’s neatly-barbered poll detracts
from the abandon of her mumming—but, all the
same, I can’t help wondering how she keeps her
hair on.
A little story illustrative of the divided sym-
pathies of the sweet girl graduate. A very clever
science-studentess lately became engaged to a
bachelor of science, and almost in the same breath
gained a place in the honour-list—but in the
second-class. On commemoration-day one of the
he-students met her, and, wishing to felicitate her
upon her engagement, began to reel off the in-
evitable, “Allow me to offer my congratu ”
when the lady calmly interrupted him: “Oh,
thanks, hut of course it was only a second-class
affair, you know—better though, I suppose, than
none at all ? ” As the scientific fianc£ is a
nervous and myopic youth who wears overproof
spectacles and seems undecided what to do with
his feet, the he-student wonders right up to this
moment what she really meant.
Many a man owes his success to the possession
of a pretty wife. A high-up Sydney official, lately
asked by a very charming woman indeed for an
appointment for out-of-work hubby, answered :
“Tell him to be at my office at 2.30 p.m. to.
morrow, and I will do something for him for your
sake, dear Mrs. .” Next day, at 2.40, the
lady was surprised by a visit from the sympathetic
one. “ Why,” said she, “Mr. has gone to
your office” “Just so; and now we shall be
able to have a nice quiet chat together.” That is
portion of the lady’s story, anyhow.
A quarrel between His Ex. of Thereabouts, up
North, and the private secretary is more than a
mere difference of opinion over the spelling of a
word, for the secretary has been a blighted l being
who cannot get into even the outskirts of the
master’s train since weeks, aye, months agone.
The very desirable way of viewing the country,
which a vice - regal jaunt to some distant
butter-factory or other presents, has not been
open to the p.s., who now mournfully tails-up the
ladies of the household when they go abroad
officially, and otherwise fritters his secretaryship
away in more poodle-work than usually falls to
the lot of even a Government House attache.
“Pipple say” that his Excellency—who isn’t
exactly the rage on his official dunghill—has ceased
to smile upon his quill-driver on that very account.
There may be faults on both sides, after all, and it
is plainly the duty of an able-bodied secretary to
go on his marrow-bones, if the individual under
his care turns restive, and use every imploring
argument in the dictionary to bring his man up
to time. It strikes me that the p.s. is somewhat
to blame when a Governor makes too big a fool of
himself, or freezes off his subjects by some easily-
avoidable blunder. A really smart secretary
should regulate a Governor’s manner as well as his
mail-bag, and model him to suit his public whether
the great man knows it or not. The price of that
sort of secretary would be about =£2ooo a year.
And his value would be <£sooo.
I hear that what promised to be a very peppery
scandal, had it got into horse-hairdom, was hushed-
up down South recently by the good sense of the
wife—the stylish and musical better half of a pro-
fessional man who was lured from the track
of virtue by the Hebe of a historical hotel.
Historical because it was there, my child,
that a lordling since fell upon evil times,
and I hear that the self-same shanty caused a well-
known squatter many a sleepless night, not long
ago. In the present case the scandal was averted.
What a peptonized world it would be if every
wife had the common-sense to go and do likewise !
Somebody suggests, in the S.M. Herald, that
a howling want in Sydney is a home, with a
lethal chamber attached, for stray dogs. But
what is more wanted is a lethal chamber for stray
men. I wonder just how many Domain denizens
there are at this very moment who, with the rain,
damp grass, and tightened waist-belt of hungry
winter staring them in the face, would walk
into the death - dealing atmosphere cheerfully
conscious that they would be carried out of it the
mere husk of an angel, so to speak ? Death hasn’t
many fancy terrors for a hungry man whose hair
is sticking out of the crown of his hat.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, April 24, 1894.
The gilt-buttoned officers of the Austrian war-
ship Fasana have been flitting from one feminine
flower to another in true naval butterfly style, and
their knowledge of “English as she is spok ”
being tolerably up to date, they have managed to
tell their love with pleasing results.
A lieutenant on the Saida (an Austrian cruiser
which visited Melb. last year) used to sigh over a
misadventure that befel him at an up-country
Victorian station through the short-comings of his
English and the mistaken kindness of his hostess.
When invited to partake of any dish he always
contended himself with replying “Please” if he
meant “Yes,” and “Thank you” when he in-
tended “No.” The evening of his arrival he was
asked to take a second cup of tea and declined in
his usual formula, “Thank you.” Nevertheless,
his cup was replenished, so not wishing to be un-
gracious, he disposed of its contents, only to be
offered a further supply. Though particular on
this occasion to distinctly enunciate his refusal,
his wishes were misinterpreted for the second time!
Anxious to infringe no rule of Australian table
etiquette, the swelling hero lapped up six liberal
jorums of netve-destroyer, bestowed upon him
despite many heartfelt “Thank you’s.” At last
he could stand it no longer, when, for the seventh
time, he beheld an inexorable hand extended
towards his cup, he exclaimed, beseechingly and
almost with tears: “Thank you!” “Thank
you /” “ Please, no !” “ No, please 1 The cup is
large, and I am small!”
The “Fasana” is being kept in countenance by
“ the Kreisser ” with its “ Russian bears,” a mis-
leading title, the braves in question being, like
most of their nation, polite to a degree.
Some years ago, I’m told, a Russian cruiser was
leaving its anchorage at Albany, and making its
way out of the harbour to the strains of the
national hymn, sung by the crew. It was early
morning, and the local Government Resident,
taking his daily ride on the beach with some
friends, came under the notice of the ship’s com-
mander, who immediately caused his men to
change their tune into “ God Save the Queen,” as
a neat little farewell compliment to their late
entertainers. Could politeness any further go ?
One of the pretty sisters, who returned from
Europe by a recent P. and 0., is engaged to a
young squatter of the Stawell neighbourhood,
about as eligible a parti as any girl could desire!
His condition of orphanhood (all in his favour as
any bride will testify), added to the circumstance
of his <£200,000, stamps his capture as the matri-
momal event of the season. Though not more
than twenty-three summers have left their traces
on his open brow, the bridegroom-elect would, no
doubt,_ have been quite a confirmed benedict by
this time had not a constitutional bashfulness
been his safeguard against feminine wiles. So
marked was this idiosyncracy, that the appear-
ance of a petticoated vision bearing down affec-
tionately upon his sisters’ Toorak abode, was
always the signal for his hasty exit by a back
entrance. However, fate overtook him at last
and the days of his liberty are numbered—indeed*
he has already done a trial trip round the
continent in gilded hobbles.
It is said that nobody is so useful as to be in-
dispensable. There are always ten pairs of feet
itching to fill one pair of vacated shoes, which is
perhaps the reason why a matron nowadays, when
she feels premonitory symptoms of cold or head-
ache, summons her husband to her bedside and
conjures him, by all he holds sacred, to reveal the
name of the destined Number Two. To give the
desired information would probably be the best
way of hastening the sufferer’s convalescence, but
one never hears of a man venturing to try so
drastic a remedy 1 Maybe “ the husband famine”
is responsible for this state of affairs. Formerly
(I am told) a woman, when she had once bagged
her matrimonial bird, took no further trouble
about him, as even were he friskily inclined, she
knew that very few girls would exert themselves
to dance to his piping.
In these overwomaned days, however, there are
belles galore, ready to practise their little wiles
upon men for lack of profitable sport, so
that an affectionate and watchful wife has more
worry and bother shepherding her dear John
(stout and baldish though he be) than ever she
experienced when he was an active Romeo, with
the escape door still open to him. In the time of
glamour he felt no desire to slip away, probably.
All the same, there’s not more than a grain of
truth in most of what’s said about the “ Husband
Famine.” One certainly sees bevies of unattached
maidens everywhere, but most of them will be
appropriated in the end. The fact that people
don’t “set up house ” so early in life as they used
to accounts to some extent for the apparent glut
of marriageable females and obstinately celibate
men.
The girls of now don’t leave school until 19 or
20, whereas 40 years ago a spinster of the latter
age was looked upon as drawing perilously near
“the shelf.” Novelists, who are generally behind
the times, still swear by heroines in their teens.
Hamilton Clarke (late leader of Melb. orchestra)
in his book, “ Two Chorus Girls,” only attributed
14 summers to the leading lady of the story. Yet,
I imagine that Mrs. Ham. 0. was more than twice
seven when he lured her from the stage.
In Westralia, long ago, the girls (most of them
the daughters of uppercrust pioneer families) were
brought out at 15 and married off the following
year.
When in the Perth diocese a devout Anglican
Archdeacon (still to the fore) chose a helpmeet of
“ frolicsome 14 ” no one thought it odd, though
nowadays bishops, clergy and laity would raise a
concerted moan at the bare mention of such green
fruit-stealing. The Archdeaconess in question
soon fell into her groove, though the first batch of
callers heard a good deal of mysterious scuffling
outside the drawing-room door. Their dignified
pastor, as it turned out, was forcibly assisting his
bashful bride into the presence of “ company;”
she, meantime, trying all she knew to hark back
to her interrupted pastimes of story-book reading
and biscuits.
Talking of successors being raised up, young
men will find balm in the thought that the
marriage of the Werribee heiress need not ring
the curtain down upon hymeneal hope. A hand-
some girl, with an annual income of ,£5OOO already
and unconditionally her own, should be a comfort-
ing circumstance to the weary fortune-hunter.
This lucky damsel, not yet out of the school-room,
is the only child and sole heiress of an old cele-
brity who died at Daylesford the other week, and
subsequently “ lay in state ’’ in the local Anglican
church. Happiness and a barouche and pair are
in store for some future drawer of the winning
ticket.
Endowed womanhood doesn’t always have a
rosy time, as shown by the anxiety of a local pro-
fessional man’s rich wife to annul her marriage,
on the grounds of alleged cruelty, desertion, &c.
Before her union she was the belle of an
up-country town, the effect of her beaux ycux
being backed up by the eclat of a moneyed father,
and she chose the partner of her affluence from a
host of admirers in pouting opposition to the
wishesof herfriends. The cominglaw-suit willbe by
no means the first occasion on which this litigious
couple have aired their disagreements. For a long
time the guardianship of their two children, who,
by the terms of their maternal grandfather’s will!
are well worth clinging to, provided a bone of
contention; the youngsters in the end being
handed over, by law, to the male parent’s care.
Re the Australian Judge who required “ a
governess or companion for his only daughter,”
his advertisement caused quite a flutter at the
time. It was worded so insinuatingly that any
number of high-toned though reconstructed
maidens bombarded him with crested and mono-
grammed applications. The advertiser’s location
was specified, so if (as hinted by a recent press-
letter) the whole affair was a fishing-expedition,
the question arises, which of the Judges in that
locality was the joker ? One of them might have
been capable of it once , but he had his wig combed
down a while ago.
A bachelor bank-manager at Beechworth was,
so I hear, lately astounded by a rush of neatly-
written, elegantly-worded offers to undertake the
education of his “little boy.” A facetious friend
had inserted an advt. in the Argus representing
the banker as a widower with a small son crying
out for instruction; hence all the “sport.” Un-
employed, hard-up governesses are the worst
people in the world at appreciating practical
jokes—in fact, fun of this description is pretty
well death to some of them. To awake from
dreams of lonely bankers and possible contin-
gencies to the cold, hard fact that she has wasted
another postage-stamp, is a bitter trial for any
spinster in distress.
Before long, unless an educational advt. states
that there are 12 children in the family requiring
Parisian French, plain needlework, and co’nstant
Christian forbearance from their governess at the
rate of 10s. per dozen weekly, it will be viewed
with suspicion, and shunned as a brilliant snare.
It is pleasant to hear that Bayley, of “Bayley’s
Reward,” came back to Victoria, after his lucky
find, and showered benefits on his delighted
relatives, exactly like the returned Nabob of
polite fiction.
Two of}fhis brothers he rescued from backblock
State schools, and fixed up comfortably at a
station near Ballarat. In calm contemplation
of their flocks and herds they are learning to
forget their early struggles with the native intel-
and the dark shadow of the blackboard is
passing _ away from the redeemed teachers.
Bayley is the sort of brother who deserves to
discover a gold-mine.
Theannounoementof Madame Carandini’s death,
cabled from England, last Monday, must have
brought thoughts of other years to many old Aus-
tralians. Long, long ago the Carandinis used to
make professional tours throughout Australia,
visiting out of the way towns which had never been
similarly favoured. The children in such places
derived their first ideas of public entertainments
and professional singers from these concerts, and
enlightened the monotony of existence for months
afterwards by playing at “ the Carandinis,”
steeping scraps of red ribbon in water to obtain
the necessary rouge and squalling, “ Take care

beware; she is fooling thee,” to an accompaniment
of kerosene-tins. For many years Madame lived
at Windsor (Melb.), her artistically-furnished cot-
tage, with its arrangement of Oriental draperies
and curios (souvenirs of visits to her daughter,
X,ady Morland, at Calcutta), bearing witness to
the owner’s taste. She was a showy, vivacious
old lady to the last, and very ambitious for the
musical future of her grand-daughter, Muriel
Morland, a handsome girl and a born singer and
actress, who was under her care a while.
Poor Mr. M‘Kay, victirnof the Barraba bank out-
rage, was a brilliant pianist, and so popular an
official that he never left a town to take charge of
another branch without receiving a presentation.
His wife, the daughter of a former Melb. Mayor,
and sister of the wife of Dr. Hewlett, of CJarltou
(Vic.), has always shared in her husband’s popu-
larity. Before, her marriage she was a fine-looking
girl, known in the neighbourhood of her up-
country home as “the snake-huntress,” from her
skill in tracking down those reptiles and killing
hem in deft blaoktellow-fashion.
The wife of a certain Australian potentate, being
the daughter of a millionaire, is necessarily very
mean. “ Can’t you compose a few waltzes ? ” she
said to the girls’ music-teacher, “it would be
cheaper than wasting money buying them at the
shop.” Apropos, a big Melbourne inusic firm has
just gone insolvent.
An afternoon-tea shop has been opened in Mel-
bourne by an ex-society lady. Heaps of girls are
learning dressmaking and others millinery. Pre-
sently the poor professionals will have to turn
governesses, a calling becoming less popular every
year. Society has not recruited the ranks of
coffee-palace waitresses yet, but is only awaiting
financial developments.
Art is at such a low ebb in Australia that one
painter who has given to the world some most

The principal cause of Matthew Henry Davies s
schedule has been “ the failure of various financial
institutions in which insolvent had invested large sums
of money and was a shareholder.” The poor fellow is
another of the many victims of those wretched land-boom
onnpanies.
» * * *
Joseph Bartlett Davies has followed the lead of
Brother Matthew by filing his schedule —Assets, £BO,OOO ;
liabilities, £593,000. J.B.D.’s schedule is supposed to
come as a financial shock to the queer community of
Melbourne. In that paradise of respectable double-
shuffling the insolvency of a small tradesman, or clerk,
occurs in the natural order of things as soon as he fails to
meet his bills, w hereas the bloated bank-bleeder can owe
half a-raillion and yet keep bankruptcy at bay until it
s fits his purpose to swagger into Court and pay pence
i i the £ for an unconditional release. Which reminds
The Bulletin that Judge Molesworth had “much
pleasure” in releasing that “unfortunate victim of cir-
cumstances,”.Mr. James Munro, when he produced his
little sixpence. The Court’s sympathy for Messrs. M. and
J. B. Davies may be expected to ensue. J. B. Davies
reports that his “losses" since October, 1891, have
amounted to £618,000. His “deficiency" is now
£513,000, ergo J. B. Davies might have settled up his
accounts 2i years ago, leaving himself with a credit
balance of £105,000 or so. What hideous nonsense these
land-boomers inflict upon the ignorant!
* * * ♦
Joseph Bartlett Davies’ schedule was very
nearly filed on the Q.T. after 4.30 pan. But the press
hadn't left the Courts, and it was taken hot to the
machines. Brother Matthew didn't worry with his.

Lawyer Higgins advances the ghastly theory
that there was nothing exceptional in the Melbourne
management of the Federal Bank. And a Victorian
Ju lge answers: “Then I say, frankly, I am quite sure
there were an enormous number of unexceptional things
done at that time of which I utterly disapprove, and
many of which, I should not hesitate to say, were
thoroughly dishonest.” Quite a nasty jar for Smell-
bourne’s unconvicted criminals 1
♦ * ♦ *
From the Federal Bank investigator’s report on
the directors’ accounts: “The conclusion forced upon
me by examination of the books is that Mr. James Munro
did not provide any of the capital whatever for the above
undertakings ’’—meaning speculations out of which the
ancient Jimmy expected to amass abnormal wealth.
“Mr. William M‘Lean is a large speculator, and all the
transactions recorded in these accounts appear to have
been carried on, not with capital furnished by himself,
except to an inappreciable extent, hut with advances
obtained from the bank.” However, the Vic. Govern-
ment, per favour of Patterson, has expressed its complete
sympathy with the Munro clan, so depositors ought to
feel satisfied.

To allow Mr. Priestley to continue as Federal
Bank liquidator would be simply monstrous. No man is
a competent judge in his own cause.

Frequently - recurring item from the cable-
reports of the examination of the N.Z.L. and M. Co.

candid ?

It is practically an open secret in Melbourne
that two banks, at all events, will go down when the re-

According to latest returns the Queensland
Government has £2,409,000 of reconstructed public funds
in the Q.N. Bank, and £743,000 at current account; total,
£3,152,000. The £743,000 is money lodged since the his-
torical stoppage. By and by the shindykit Qoverwment
will the new Ministry will draw a stupendous
cheque on the Q.N. Bank. Probably it is the prospect of
that cheque which keeps the £3 lOs.-shares down to the
monotonous quotation: “Sellers, 2s. 6d.; no buyers.”
Another interesting item in the story of the
N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., is the acknowledge-
ment that £348,000 of losses “appeared in the balance-
sheet as an asset,” and that the “ Melbourne deficit ” of
£480,000 was “ not disclosed to the shareholders.” And
this is only a feeble sample of what would have come out
concerning almost all the other suspended institu-
tions if public inquiry hadn’t been judiciously smothered,
and the reconstructions rushed through before the
creditors got their second wind.

During the past few months the Southern
Hebrews have negotiated hills (all under £100) at rates
varying from 100 per cent, to 250 per cent, made by the
owner of a Melbourne Cnp winner, the owners of Cham-
pion and Australian Cup winners, and the winner
of one of Tattersall’s big Australian Cup sweeps. Inas-
much as all the wins occurred during the past (say 110)
years, this looks like “ Easy come, easy go.”

The Southern compromises of the past quarter
include (1) a firm who, as traders, squatters, &c.,
were worth £250,000 apiece a few’ years ago. They offer
2s. in the £, extended over ten years, on liabilities of
£600,000. (2) A country storekeeper who retired in 1888
with £210,000. He compromises on t'409,000 at 7d. in the
£. (3) A very big speculator and trader who, seven years
ago, could get a marked cheque for £150,000. He squares
up at 3d. in the £. Southern banks are the main
sufferers; so it’s no wonder that these estates don’t go
through the Court. Destroy confidence, don’t you know.

With all their cuteness, the Jews have only

The Australian Rights Purchase Bill is quiescent
just now—scotched, in fact, by the N.S.W. Labour-party.
But it is a noble enterprise and well worth fighting for;
and it will not be abandoned by the promoters until the

able figure it would give as a minimum £lOOO for every

Australia, during the last five years, has in-
creased her wool-clip by 32 per cent., or 465,000 bales,
and hasn’t received a farthing more than for the clips
prior to the beginning of the mentioned period. There
has been in that time an increase of 24 million sheep, and,
sc far as wool is concerned, the continent isn’t a penny
the richer. What an awful slump! Also, what liar was
it who said that production stops when prices fall below
the cost of production ? Many stations in the Australias
are not making tucker, but they have to keep going—
the sun and the seasons stop for no overdraft.

But supposing it had been the New South, or

Brokenhillionaire Horn has financed the big
expedition of scientists, explorers, land-grabbers and
presstiien, which starts this month from Adelaide to spy
out the supposed wealth lying around in the M‘Donnell
Ranges, Centralia. From this isolated mass of ranges,
gullies and table-land, set in the sandy, waterless bed of a
prehistoric inland sea, great finds are expected. Strathal-
lon, surveyor of the boundary ’twixt S. Australia and
Queensland, some years back reported the discovery of
gold-hearing reefs, probable diamond drift, vast mica
beds, and supposed rubies in the M‘Donnell Ranges, and
explorer Lindsay utilised his subsequent visit by floating
a ruby mining company, along with Henniker Heaton, in
London. Experts declared the rubies garnets all the
same. Lindsay did not lose money by the deal. Horn’s
scientific zeal probably has a solid basis.

A letter has been sent to the directors of Broken

saved. M’yes ! Many people will carefully watch this

gone to the other extreme. Mining in N.S.W. is either

Dear Bulletin,—There appears to be an over
amount of sanguineness displayed with regard to the ex-
pected rainfall at Murchison and Coolgardie, out west, if
one may judge by the hundreds rushing that way. From
what the writer knows of that most patchy of countries
(patchy in soil, manners, and minerals), he being a Kim-
berleyite, the rain-season at the latter district takes place,
usually, at the end of Dec., and extends through Jan.
to middle of Feb. The tropical storms drift south coastal-
ways, extending some distance inland, but tail off the
farther they go south. The rain-storms may or may not
reach Murchison and Coolgardie. When in W.A., in
1886, the Murchison River had not run for two years.
Drought appears in cycles, and it is on the cards
that the season will hi a dry one. The much-talked-
of water expected in the deep lands seems pro-
blematic. In a country with a light rainfall and
an extensive arid background it hardly seems
probable that a strong flow of water will be struck
at a depth. Anyhow, not sufficient to run a 20-head of
stamps throughout the year. Granted a rainfall, then
conservation must be expensive on account of the tremen-
dous evaporation. The conveyance of ore to water
appears to be the cheapest way out of the difficulty for
all concerned. When a railway-line is laid down, and until
then, claim-holders had better hold their hands in dam
construction ; they had much better hurry up matters by
sending round the hat, and contribute to railway con-
struction what each claim-holder would require to expend
upon a dam to work his property,—Yours truly, Taipo,
Melb., 23rd April.

Lack of humour doesn’t always pay dividends.
A raining syndicate called “The United Adventurers" is
in laborious—it is understood very laborious—process of
flotation at Melb. By the way, some years ago, a Melb.
libel-suit was based on the fact that a newspaper had
referred to someone as an “ adventurer.” We forget how
the case went, but the term is, in its latter-day accepta-
tion, actionable enough.

Williams, the Argus special, is going across
country from Coolgardie to Murchison, despite David
Lindsay’s assurance that he will never get through.
Williams hails from Ballarat, and should be able to com-
pare the two fields discreetly. His paper is much annoyed
at the storm raised over Pearson’s articles at the beginning
of the year, when the lawyer damned all Coolgardie mines
outside Bayley’s, and died. No expense is being spared
on this occasion.
It is unknown who is acting as Coolgardie
special for the Age, hut the articles are believed to be the
result of amateur labour. One of “ David’s " nephews is,
however, acting as chainman for the Government sur-
veyor, and he may possibly be responsible.
Westralian Customs are being ruthlessly
trampled on by the t’othersiders, whose latest idea is the
introduction of teams two abreast with wide-gauge wag-
gons and welded axles. All axles of local waggons and
heavy drays are in two pieces bolted to the bed. Rock-
liffe, of Broken Hill, is the pioneer of the two-abreast
crusade, which is meeting with bitter opposition on the
road.
Teamsters are now arriving with nothing but
swags aboard, the “swamper’s” baggage being more
remunerative than ordinary loading. With the heavy
roads of winter there will probably be a famine at Cool-
gardie, as the teams simply cannot carry enough food for
the crowd on the field.

Queer tales are told up North of fortunes gained
by suppressing information. One manager is said to
have kept boring-rods going ahead of the crosscut where
the reef was expected. One day something came out of the
bore, and the manager knocked off the men in the cross-
cut and put them shaft-sinking, explaining that the reef
had evidently gone astray, and it was useless to hunt for
it. The shaft went steadily down in hard conglomerate,
and the shares fell as steadily from 10s. to Is. Then the
manager changed his mind and put the men back in the
crosscut. The third shift cut the reef, carrying good
gold in slate country. The first crushing went 30z., the
second 70z.; shares went up to 455., and three months
afterwards the manager went ’Ome, where he bought an
estate and was enjoying life thoroughly at last accounts.

Quong Tart has gone on another trip to
China, He is already a sort of Chinese C.M.G.,

The latest report as to ex- Agent-General

The Consul-General for Liberia at Mel-

Lord Kintore arrives in Sydney from Van-
couver, per Arawa, May 6. He comes to complete
his reign in Adelaide without either his wife or
his children, and rumour states that he will then
pass on to Melbourne to succeed Gov. Hopetoun.
Salisbury and Rosebery are the only two
British Premiers who ever set foot on Australian
soil —the Conservative in his ante-political days,
so that his personal knowledge is of small value,
the Liberal when in full possession of his political

Papa Pinnock, P. M., of Brisbane, when
inebriates are brought before him, wonders where
they raise the money to get drunk with. “ I
know,” says he pathetically, “ I cannot pay for
liquor.” It is melancholy to see any old gentle-
man having to give such broad hints.
Sir Charles Russell, the most brilliant
present-day English advocate, just raised to the
Bench, used always to cry copiously when defend-
ing a woman. He wept reservoirs over Lady Colin
Campbell. He takes snuff, too, so that powder
and tears merged sweetly into odoriferous mud on
his big coloured handkerchief,
Montgomery, the condemned Sydney
burglar, is said by a Melb. detective, who knew
him well, to have been the regal Bill Sikes of
Australia. The skeleton key and crowbar gentry
considered it the height of their ambition to be
allowed to burgle in his company. He was so
expert and brutally fearless.
N.S.W. Speaker Abbott was once compar-
ing notes with Gov. Jersey, and remarked that
his musical ear was so defective that he only knew
one tune, and that was the National Anthem.
“ I know another man,” said Jersey, “who is so
sound-blind that he only knows the National
Anthem by the fact that the people take off their
hats to it; and that’s myself.”

all enter therefore with com-

Sad to think that Sam.
Way, as S.A, Lieut.-Gov., has
the privilege of advising the
Colonial Office as to the con-
ferring of titles upon his fellow-
citizens, but, alas, cannot put
in a good word for that Privy
Councillorship which he so
much yearns for. _He is, by
many years, the senior Austra-
lian Chief Justice, and, as the
dignity has come to Alfred
Stephen, he sees no particular
x'eason why he should not get it.
Rev. Dr. O’Dowd, of
Ballarat, who died recently,
possessed less than _ half-a-
crown at the time of his death,
says the Age. If so, he will fly
lighter on his road to heaven.
Apropos, some time ago there
was published the story of a
Melbourne clergyman whose
friends, when they had closed
his eyes, proceeded to inves-
tigate his worldly affairs. They
found his earthly riches hung
up in his rusty old black waist-
coat behind the door. The
total was twopence.
One newspaper cable states that Queen
Victoria kissed the bride and the bridegroom and
the parents of the bride at the recent German-
sausage wedding. Another cable says that she
“was affected to tears.” For such items as these
has Science harnessed God’s lightning and dragged
it over thousand miles of sea and land.
Neither of the Melb. dailies reported
jockey Hayes’ retort when Purves, Q. 0., asked
him if he had ever seen any reputable gentleman
in company with Goddard, the bruiser. “Yes,
sir,” was Hayes’ reply, “ I have seen the president
of the Melbourne Athletic Club.” Which was
trying for Chief Justice Madden, by whom the
case was being heard, as in Goddard’s time that
learned bruiser held the presidency.
Marie Elizabeth Amy Castilla, M.B.’
Ch. 8., newly appointed house-surgeon of St’

This is the first time in Australia that a woman
has been appointed surgeon in a general hospital,
and there is a good, though not here explainable,
reason why the precedent should not be followed.
A certain Australian commandant is an
expert horseman and expects his officers to be
ditto. At a recent parade he ordered an A.D.C.
to tell Captain So-and-so that he wanted him,
“and over the fence is the shortest way.” The
officer went, and “like a soldier fell.” Then the
general, sternly regarding the prostrate one,
“ And be good enough, sir, to obey orders, and go
over the fence, not through it.”
The late “ Jack” Robertson once attended
a memorial mass at St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney.
He knelt beside Tom Slattery, and endured it as
long as he could. At length, leaning over to the
devout Tom, he whispered—“ Tom, this is all
(very) fine, but I’d give anything for a brandy-
and-soda.” Tom replied in a reverent undertone
—“Nothing easier. The ceremony is just about
finished, so come with me,” and he led “Jack”
into an ante-room, rang for the housekeeper and
ordered some refreshments. Whisky, brandy,
wine, etc., were soon disclosed to old “Jack’s”
wondering gaze, who, quaffing a brandy-and-soda
with much relish, gave his opinion thus—“ Tom,
old boy, after all, this must be the (only) true
church.”

The Bulletin also wants to see alien niggers excluded

lose their living through the operations of nigger-driven
camels are to be pitied ; but their case can’t be remedied
by arguing that the camel should be legally excluded
from Australia—or, what would be almost the same thing,
excluded from towns. You might as well seek to sup-

Dear Bulletin, — Somebody
writes to a Melb. paper from Cool-
gardie : “ A much more serious
question than the shortness of the
supply of provisions is the seemingly
never-ending stream of passengers—
or ‘swampers,’ as they are more
generally termed—arriving by these
teams.” One of the first Hinglish
sneers of the newchum in Australia
is directed against the local tend-
ency to regard him as a “ swamper.”
He has no right to come to the place
patronised by his predecessors, ho is
a grievance to the “ earlier settlers,”
and they would like to know what
the devil he means by it. Within
a week of my arrival in Melbourne
I was made aware of my imperti-
nence in poaching on the preserves
of older inhabitants. Speaking of
this peculiarity to a lady who had
arrived with her husband in the
“fifties” I found that she in her
newchum days was called upon to
answer the aggressive inquiry,
“What brought you out here?’ Even
then the handful of population com-
plained that “ everybody would be
coming to Victoria soon, they sup-
posed”—to swamp the place. Accord-
ing to all accounts, these later emi-
grants to Coolgardie are as likely to
fall across gold as those who have
been a few months on the field
yet_ they have no business to be
trying their luck because they didn’t
get there before. My newchum
sore dates back to ten years ago, or
more, and I thought it was healed
until that “ swamper ” remark
rubbed it hard and caused me to
sneer again at Australian “ hospi
tality.”—Yours, Commonwealth.
W. C. M‘Kay, manager of the Commercial
Bank at Barraba, a small N.S. W. township some
200 miles north of Sydney, was shot dead on
April 18 by one of two men who stuck up the
bank in the dinner-hour, and escaped, but without
any plunder. A Govt, reward of .£2OO each is
offered for the murderers, one of whom is supposed
to have been accidentally wounded, since his
mate had to support him on his horse. A
man named Cummings has been arrested on
suspicion of being one of the men concerned. The
salient point of the tragedy is the ease with which
it was consummated, and with which it may be
consummated again at any of the many trifling
bush townships in Australia. The victim had
actually foreseen his fate. “I often asked him,”
said his wife at the inquest, “ ‘ What would you do
if someone should accost you with arms and de-
mand the cash ? Would you not give it to them?’
He replied : * No, I would not; I should do my
duty.’ He said that robbers would not come at
night; he said they would come at dinner-hour,
when he had the keys and there were only a few
people about.” And so precisely it fell out.
Obviously bank-officials in such circumstances
need both more protection and more precaution.

M'Credie, M.P. (N.S.W.), who was elected
as an opponent of payment of members, has drawn

legislative efforts so far have not given the country
an exalted idea of the value of unpaid members.
The N.S.W. Freetrade-party will go to

tary compensation to legislatively-extinguished
publicans, and on maintaining the claims of these
traders on a time-compensation, which may be

N.S. Wales pro-
duces sugar with
white labour only,
and would produce
much more were it
not for the handicap
consequent on the
restrictive excise on
the distillation o f
rum from the waste
product. In W eat
Indies and Mauritius
the still pays all tha
expenses of manu-
facture; but in
N.S.W. the molasses,
&c., are often run
into the rivers for
want of a market.
Meantime, sly stills
flourish, protected by
the extortionate excise
duty, while lawful
distillation is in the
hands of a monopoly.
If the duty were
halved the revenue
would b e doubled,
and the public could
be protected from
the consumption of
fusel oil by a sensibly-
drawn Adulteration
Act. The heavy duty
doesn’t lessen drunk-
enness. It is simply
a premium on the
sale of distilled mad-
ness.
Jenkins, who has been promoted from the

crosses the border into one oi the others.
Negotiations for a coalition of N.S.W.

the other hand, was considered a possibility.
“Take my cue,” said Premier Dibbs the
other day to a parliamentary aspirantif you
want your private business to gee, stick to it and
leave politics alone. I’ll never advise a friend of

your business, and then you are doomed to loa.
about Parliament the rest of your life, praying for
something to turn up. Leave politics to the
knaves and fools now at it.”
If there be a grain of truth in R. Reid’s
assertion that Australia’s gallant volunteers are
equally ready to fight their own enemies on the
spot or England’s enemies abroad, it is more
than time that militarism were abolished in this

Contingencies.
Of course America is the land of the free

trains and levy on towns in their progress to over-

N.S.W. Treasurer See, M.P., will be
opposed at next general election by a local Scotch-
man named Munro, and will have to propound

marked before, that the Government are animated

That journalistic boycott in Hungary is
said to have fired the imaginations of sundry Aus-
tralian politicians. Why not insult newspaper
reporters until their several organs agree not to
publish any more parliamentary business ? What

terrupted legislation in the darkness !
The last three S.A. Agents-General have
all been men who made politics pay. Blyth, as
Minister and Pseudo-Ambassador, drew .£32,000
in State salaries; Bray, as Minister, Speaker and
Agent-General, has thus received more than
=£15,000; and Playford, up to now, has pocketed
about .£ll,OOO as Minister and member.
Yic. Government continues its policy of
displacing stationmasters at small stations, and
giving the jobs to women. “The women do the
work for nine or ten shillings a week, the rapacious
men want thirty at least,” explains Minister
Richardson. A younger woman might be got to
fill Richardson’s position for a twentieth of his
screw, by the way.
Ex-Judge Manning, M.L. C., fights
spiritedly against the reduction in the Govern-
ment grant to the Sydney University, of which he
is Chancellor. But when half-a-year ago Govern-
ment took between .£OO,OOO and .£70,000 a year
off the grant to the State primary schools he
agreed with his fellows in the Council that the
retrenchment was a just one.
Dr, Bowker’s final vituperative on the
N.S.W. Mining on Private Lands Bill: “It is
irreligious.” As a professor of medicine the
doctor treats encroachments on his domain, either
by quacks or by patients who refuse to pay, as
ordinary incidents of business; but as a property-
holder he considers himself cousin-german to the
Almighty and orders hell-fire for trespassers.
The Crown Minister who enters an op-
ponent’s constituency and says, “ I will build
this, that, or the other for you if I am in office
three months longer,” not alone offers a bribe but
hits his opponent below the political belt. Three
members, with vitriolic tongues, have practically
absented themselves from a certain Parliament
during the current session for causes like this.
They know the Minister will not build this, that
or the other, but they know that if they open
their mouths in the House he will go again to the
constituency and say: “That is why I didn’t
build.”

Apparently U.S. Supreme Court has decided

Much disafcisfaction was caused iu Adelaide,
during last Assembly general election, because the
dailies sold, at per column, the space for candi-
dates’ speeches. The poor man got half a column,
but the rich man, if he felt inclined to pay, might
get five or six columns. At the present Council
elections the Advertiser fixes a maximum of a
column for each speaker, and rigidly refuses to
exceed that amount whatever coin is offered.
“Law and order” has been arrogated as
the shibboleth of the upper classes, but with what

In every case of serious trade dispute since Parlia-

applied to make law the arbiter; in no case, save
one, have the employers accepted that legally-

N.S.W. Mines Minister Copeland’s con-
fession, at Hillgrove, that he is as Liberal, ad-
vanced, and democratic in his opinions as a man
in his position ought to be, recalls the story of the
gentleman who squinted; “Ah,” said his wife,
“he only squints as much as a gentleman should
squint.’' It also brings to mind the exalted poten-

of certain of his acts. “Don’t you think, he

Robert Reid’s mission last week was to
thank the Duke of Garnpridge, in the name of
Australia, for having sent such magnificent
warriors as Hutton and Co. to enlighten our
defence force, and also to express the anxiety of
“ colonial volunteers ” for a first-class European
war in which they might be allowed to die for the
dear old Motherland. Unless a providential
anarchist should chance to blow up Robt. Reid
with a bomb that brass-fronted military draper
will certainly get liimself knighted.
A distribution of blankets to the Queens-
land aborigines is to be made as usual on Queen s
Birthday. Concerning which Brisbane lele-
gkaph :—lt is not intended that blankets shall be
given to aborigines unless their condition has been
prejudicially affected by the occupation of the
country by white people.” The calm assumption
that there are in existence aborigines whose con-
dition has not been prejudicially affected by white
occupation is magnificent. Evidently the coming
distribution of blankets will be the shortest on
record. .1. Bull may be addicted to cant, but

There came a witness many miles to attend
a trial the other day at Rockhampton District
Court. Case —a cheque forged on the B.N.Q.
Judge Miller, however, refused to try the case on
the grounds that he (the Judge) was a shareholder
in the aforesaid bank and consequently an in-
terested person. While respecting Judge Miller s
honourable scruples, which do him all credit, we
rise to enquire of the various Australian Govern-
ments which appoint and pay judges, what a
private employer would say if he found one of his
staff incapable of performing certain of his duties
by reason of his being engaged in private com-
mercial transactions of his own. Would not the
subordinate be promptly invested with the ancient
and honourable order of the sack? A Judge’s
only investment should be Government bonds.
X.L. : “ Here is an idea of mine, which
has grown like a snowball, all through life. The
currents of business and society do not run
parallel, but antagonistically. In other words, a
man’s home seems to be a drag on his work,
instead of a help. Baker, the Vic. Education
Minister, is weeding out the woman teachers.
Now, no one can deny that his principle is
essentially (false, but it is justified on necessity.
The women who have husbands must be the
victims, wholly irrespective of their ability, as
compared with the single women. Then there
comes in a second false distinction. The women
•whose husbands are unable to support them must
stop. This again without reference to compara-
tive ability. Such are the ideas that have under-
lain tha whole scheme of Civil Service retrench-
ment, in Victoria. The Service is thus a huge
benevolent asylum.”
Dear Bulletin, —Be Pope’s advice to
Poles, Russia is “at the root of Polish liberty ”
such as it is. Says Irish-Secretary Morley :
“ About 19 out of every 20 of the inhabitants [of
Poland] were serfs without a single civil or
political right; one in 20 was a noble; and the
Polish nobles were the vainest, most selfish, most
cruelly intolerant, most lawless aristocracy of
ancient or modern times.” No person who knows
the facts can deny that the partition of Poland,
though much mourned over by canting senti-
mentalists, was a real gain to the people of Poland.
Certainly their progress has not been, since then,

of a w hite face could be seen staring out into the

with his chin resting on the back of bis hand.
Coroner Donlin, who chanced to be looking
out of the car window during tl' ed ay,Baw at once
that it was no common face that glared at him.
He left the train, went to the house, and there
found kneeling by the window the stiffened corpse
of a man. For two days he had kept the vigil of
the dead. Awaking in the right, alone and
oppressed, he had struggled to the window, and,
gasping for breath, died. The coroner s examma-
tion revealed the fact that death had been caused
by Bright’s disease of the kidneys, which came
unannounced, sudden and sure.
j Y es, but how common have these sudden
deatbs become. You note them in the local press
every day- They give no warning. There is a

therefore-—-it was not patriotic—it was
not Christian—to ignore tne larger ques-

our popular amusements as a whole. The
church would be simply abrogating its functions
as a great educational and moral factor in the
.national its functions with
guilty carelessness or cowardice—if it did not
seek, while shielding its own youth from the
evils connected with certain recreations, to nut
fortn every effort to make all kinds of amuse-
ments indulged in by the people as sound and
wealthy and elevating as possible. Personally he
had a strong conviction that if the churches sot
themselves to accomplish this object in the right
way they might rely on being supported by a
strong and.overwhelming force of public opinion.

LIGHT ON THE POLICE FOORCE.
A Waverley Alderman suggests that other Forces in Nature might be made to co-operate with the Police Force, and suggests an incandescent electric-lighting apparatus
be laid on to each policeman.
No. 1.—Certainly the old-fashioned method of looking for burglars with a lighted match seems out of step with the times. No. 2.—Instead of the light being affixed to
the policeman’s stomach by means of his belt, this paper suggests that the helmet would be the most effective. A storage battery might be fitted to its upper storey (as seen in
the above sectional view) with incandescent burner on top. No. 3. —The objection to attaching the light to the stomach will be apparent on recalling a recent police episode.
The most unscientific may perceive at once how, by such a method of attack, the glim would be instantaneously doused. No. 4-5.—An illuminated constabulary would be
open to objections from some quarters. In the Domain, for instance. No. 6. —There is no good reason why “clever captures” should not be made by means of electricity. A
generating dynamo, say, in each of bobby’s boots, attached by means of wire to metal handles, would do away with the present clumsy and unsightly handcuffs. No. 7-8. —The
ordinary electric-light, for instance, might be mistaken for the regular “foorce” to the [?]mecessary terror of some of our citizens, or mislead others to inquire their own addresses
of insensate lamp-posts.

prevalent and women and children were in much
suffering. The great lady wrote back:—“Dear

Dear Bulletin, —All honour to Brigham
Brown, M.D., F.R.C.S., if there is such a man. '-
Monogamy is a failure and Polygamy has always
been successful. I have tried both. The disas-
trous case is a lapsus from either ; e.g., a cause for
divorce in so-called civilised countries or a selection
of a favourite in the harem. I never lived more
happily than with two or three wives. I never
was more worried than with one. Ido not know
liow many I have now alive. There are none with
me. And wives fairly treated and on one equality
agree to yield to one another in their “fortes.”
Thus my cook-spouse was acknowledged at meals
to be a dear old thing ; my music-half (or was it
third or fifth?) applauded; the dressmaker-help-
meet was a Worth to us, and the beauty-love was
Queen of Beauty. But, then, I am a just man
and know how to keep my aquus animus. And,
again, I say Hipperay for Brigham Brown !
Yours, Brigham Scotty Wrinkled.

Dear Bulletin, — Apropos of your para-
graph last week about the officers of the Salvation
Army travelling first saloon in the ocean liners.
1 was a passenger per Austral from Naples to
Australia 18 months ago, and we had on board
Miss Lucy Booth, on her way to take charge of
the Indian mission. She travelled second saloon,
spent a good deal of her time, between seasickness,
in the steerage conducting services and nursing
the sick; and put on no “side.” When we arrived
at Colombo, Ceylon, she and her lady companions
assumed the Indian costume of the Army, which
is almost identical with the native dress, and
went ashore in their bare feet. Personally my
religion is nondescript, but I could not help
admiring the pluck, the real heroism of this
cultured and refined girl a skilled musician,
and evidently anything but strong physically,
going ashore in her bare feet on that roasting day,
when the ground would almost blister one through
the soles of one’s boots. Add to this the moral
heroism —for the haughty Anglo-Indians look
with scorn on native races, and with contempt
and disgust upon a white assuming the native
costume —and you will agree, as all the sceptics
did on board that ship, that at any rate one
officer of the Salvation Army was not a feather-
bed soldier. —Yours, Sceptic.
Another young man came to Sydney
Hospital last week with a revolver-bullet in his
head, which struck him as he was walking along
George-street, Nobody heard a shot or saw the
shooting; but there are so many police practising
these times that a bullet may meander very far
from its source ere it finds its billet. A stranger
might have been surprised at such an occurrence
in the chief street of the chief city of Australia ;
but, luckily, the young man was no stranger and
knew what it meant. So the bullet was taken
out of his head and labelled a visitation of the
ferocious Premier Dibbs, and everybody is as
cheerful as can be expected.

N.S.W. State-schools run Penny Savings
Banks, ostensibly to engender thrift among pupils.
Recently it was noticed that one little girl’s
account had grown unduly. She banked four or
five shillings regularly every Monday, and was
fast becoming the Fat Girl of the school; so the
teacher asked her whence came the wealth,
“Please, Miss,” answered the young capitalist,
“mother is saving up to buy a baby !” The baby
was bought shortly after, and the account closed.
Apropos , the little round tin money-box
with “Take care of the pence and the pounds will
take care of themselves” embossed thereon, which,
along with the big Bible, used to stand on the
old-fashioned round table placed in the exact
centre of the “front room,” and to which the
enfant terrible was wont to draw your attention
by rattling under your nose while_ “mamma ”
gently reproved him for being rude, is a thing of
the past now, and the more terrible penny-bank-
book has taken its place in N.S.W. With
practice one could surreptitiously slip- a tin-tag
into the money-box and make it sound like
sixpence—a convenient and strictly honest way of
getting rid of bad money. But the Public
Schools’ Penny Bank-book has changed all that;
and, in future, the thrifty young man, who always
strikes his friend’s house just about tea-time on
Sundays, will find it cheaper to dine at his hash-
house and do his visiting when the youngsters are

been striving for generations to induce the people
to revel in bun-struggles? And yet they don’t
revel. The parson follows the people, he does not
direct them. He continues to insist with bland
assurance that he is driving the team, whereas he
is only the flea on the tail of the dog under the

Policeman Ryley wanted nous ;
From sin he was converted;
He loitered by no public-house,
Nor with a cookie flirted ;
He turned from ladies of the pave,
With pious exclamations,
Or else their souls he sought to save
With scraps from “Revelations.”
The roughs he plied with tract and text,
And prayed with pocket-pickers,
And never festive clubmen vext
By borrowing their “ tickers."
He ne’er forsook his beat at night.
Nor in a doorway slumbered,
But preached a sermon, strong and trite,
To every man he lumbered.
He spake no ill, and on a ruse
No prosecution built he,
And scorned to “ run in ” or accuse
A chap who wasn’t guilty.
He was a perfect man, they knew,
But sacked him, saying slyly,
A worse policeman never grew
Than that same Mister Ryley.

Dear Bulletin, —The yarn about Father
Muldooney’s cushion is only a variant of that told
by Billy Little, then M.L.A., now miner, in
Q. Parliament on Totalisator Bill, 1892. Said
William : “No, I don’t go in for raffles. Me and
a mate went once to a bazaar and put down .£ 1
for agoon a suite of furniture. At the drawing
we threw 18 ; and then we went home. Next day
I called round with a van for the suite of furni-
ture, and they told me the parson of the church
had thrown 19 and scooped the pool. Ever since
then I’ve put my little bit of scuff on the totaliaa-
tor.”—Yours, S.
One or two questions in reference to that
Barraba murderought to be answered. 1. Why did
Mr. M‘Kay lock that door? 2. If it is true that
one of the two men who rode away from the bank
was wounded, how, and by whom, was the wound
inflicted ? Mr. M‘Kay appears to have had no
weapon, and all the three shots said to have been
fired are accounted for. 3. Why was none of
the loose cash lying about taken ? It would not
have required three seconds to cram a few hand-
fuls of coin and notes into the murderers’ pockets.
4. Was robbery the real object ?

Dear Bulletin, — Apropos “fire-madness.”
I was in Melb. Opera House when Greer shot his
wife, her paramour, and himself in the dress-circle.
Pitites, thinking it’s a fire-alarm, rise for a stam-
pede. Sharp voice from back row, “Sit down 1”
and they sit, but rise again. Louder—“ Sit down,
fools !” and they sit again, but rise a third time.
Stentorian yell—“ Sit down, you infernal, blanky
idiots !—-sit down !” and they sit and rise no more.
Novy, didn’t that single son of Belial save more

Dear Bulletin, —“D.W.’s” generalisa-
tion that man-and-wife (plus other girl’s man and
other fellow’s wife) love-story never has children
doesn’t quite hit it. They do have children; but
the children are killed off, partly for artistic
reasons, because they crowd the canvas ineffec-
tively and distract attention from the principal
figures, and partly for moral reasons, because it
would be dangerous to let children grow up in the
company of such parents. Without touching old
classics, take Hardy’s “Tess,” or the “Dodo”
and “Ideala” in every shallow reader’s mouth.
Tess has a child, but it dies—natural causes.
Dodo has a child, which dies —convulsions. Ideala
has a child—diphtheria. Then there’s Ouida’s
“ Moths”—slaughtered infants; and lots more, if
I could put my thoughts on them. “D.W.” must
really revise his theory.—Yours, A.G.
In 1885 historian Froude wrote of Adelaide
as “a city of 150,000 inhabitants, not one of whom
has ever known, or will know, a moment’s anxiety
as to the recurring regularity of his three meals a
day.” The italics are ours because a man died of
starvation there the other day.
A male tabby recently told Sydney
Women’s Literary Society “It was a part of the
English nature to insist on character more than
deeds.” Yet no man was ever more wor-
shipped in England, or lived a viler and more
scandalous private life than Nelson ; Fox was an
inveterate gambler and rou6, Wellington was
famous for his “ successes with women.”
Melb. Evening Standard refers to Sir
Walter Scott as England’s greatest writer ! Eng-
land’s ! Why not Wales’? This is in keeping
with the usages of the Victorian press. Any good
invention or creditable event happening outside
Victoria is “ Australian ; ” inside Victoria, “ Vic-
torian.” Everything discreditable to Australia,
whether Victorian or otherwise, is “Australian.”
To wit, Brennan’s Victorian torpedo, Dailey’s
Australian Contingent— not that Dailey’s Con-
tingent was creditable, but the Melb. papers
thought it was.

There have been ructions at the Savage
Club, says The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent, in re the election of a new committee.
Rightly or wrongly, Somers Vine is supposed
to entirely boss the place, and fault has
been found with the elasticity of the necessary
qualifications under the Vine regime. In conse-
quence, ever so many men have got in under the
guise of “science.” Matters have culminated
and the camp is divided into Yineites and anti-
Yineites. Twelve names were legally proposed
for election as members of the committee, but at
the general meeting an almost entirely new set
were elected, and there are actually two com-
mittees at present. What the outcome will be it
is hard to say—possibly law —bub whatever hap-
pens the club is bound to suffer to some extent.
In all probability Vine will throw up the hon.
secretaryship and clear out.
The writer knew a temperance evangelist
whose vogue it was to inspire newspaper reporters,
who came under his magnetic influence, to write
paragraphs, in good faith, asserting that some of
his admirers were about to present him with a
valuable token of their esteem, &c. His particular
day-dream was a presentation of paid-up mining-
scrip. Somehow the ceremonials predicted never
came off; or, if they did, were never publicly
chronicled. The conclusion ordinarily to be
arrived at was that the social reformer hoped to
suggest to overmoneyed fools the desirability of
acting as he dreamed and hoped. The writer
knew the godly man to be badly baulked on one
occasion, by a reporter whom he had invited to
his house to lunch. “Some friends of mine in
(say) Fossickhole,” said the water-man, “have
promised me some mining-shares in a real good
thing, and, as you have done me and my cause so
much real good, I shan’t forget you when I get
them. It will be something for your old age.”
“ Thanks, no,” replied the young reprobate, “ the
(say) Unhungtown Hatchet pays me my screw ;
but I’ll wire up to your friends for confirmation
and give the thing a paragraph, if that’s what
you want?” “Pray, don’t do anything of the
kind,” urged the Nevertouchit, “I wouldn’t let
my friends dream that I had mentioned their in-
tentions. You may give it as from an outside
source, if you like ; but don’t mention that I told
you, although it is the real truth.” “Well, I
don't like,” said the bad young man, as he rose
and went straight for the front door.

The London Commission on Labour says
of the Great Australian Adjective: “It is in
general colloquial use among the lowest classes,
and is frequently used as a qualifying adjective,
but its derivation attaches no sanguinary meaning
to it.” The said derivation being from the Anglo-
Saxon “ blodig,” which means “very.”
Dear- Bulletin, — If “J. McG.” really
saw a 4-foot sting-tailed adder, he is to that ex-
tent ahead of current ophiology, which knows
only of anlS-inch “deaf-adder” repeatedly demon-
strated to have only one “business-end”—the
head. I have personally dissected four, one of
which had killed (by the mouth) a large dog in
7 min., and the finial in each case was a solid
“claw,” unconnected with any poison apparatus.
—Experiment.
“ A woman’s tongue is only three inches
long, but it eari kill a man six feet high.”l—
THEY SPORT WITH HUMAN LIFE.
I’ll give you the plain facts in the case, and you
shall help me to judge whether there was a mistake
made or not.
It seems that some time in 1889—in the winter,
no doubt —Mr. Strong, of Leicester, was taken
down with influenza, often called the grip; and
truly a strong grip it has when it once takes a
hold. Well, lam glad to say he was able to fight
out the battle and get the best of it. But the best
wasn’t anything to brag of. The influenza hadn’t
exactly beaten Mr. Strong, but left him in a very
bad condition. And here is where you and I
properly pick up the thread of the story.
His meals didn’t tempt him; the most savoury
of dishes had no charms for our friend. He had
lost his appetite, and in the long run a man had
better lose his money. He forced down something,
of course, but it gave him such a pain in the chest
that he wished he hadn’t swallowed a mouthful.
Then, naturally, he got so weak and nervous he
couldn’t sleep o’ nights. This, as everybody
knows, is the straight road to the graveyard,
through the madhouse. Lots of people are making
that trip all the time. We must eat and we must
sleep. If we don’t we are done for. Neuralgic
pains, too, made matters worse for Mr. Strong.
He saw a doctor, and what did the doctor do?
This is what the patient says on that point:
“This doctor gave me all kinds of strengthening
medicines, but none ol ' hem did me any good, and
I continued to suffer for month after month.”
Just what we might have expected, Mr. Strong
further says : ‘‘ln October, 1890, my friend, Mr.
James Webster, of 28, New Walk, Leicester,
advised me to try a medicine called Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup, and I followed Ids advice. The
first bottle gave me great relief, and I began to
digest my food and to have an appetite ; and after
I had used three bottles I was quite another man.
I was completely cured. All my aches and pains
left me, my strength returned, and I have been
all right ever since. What astonished me was
that the Syrup cured me so quickly, and I shall
never cease thanking Mr. Webster for making it
known to me. You are at liberty to publish my
casefor thebenefit of others. Yours truly, (Signed)
W. Strong, 41, East Street, Leicester, December
30th, 1891.”
Now, was there a mistake in this matter, and
if so, what was it? Yes, there was a common
mistake made. It is an old and seemingly hope-
less blunder.
“ The doctor,” says Mr. Strong, “gave me ail
kinds of strengthening medicines.”
Open wide your ears and remember what I’m
going to tell you now ; remember it for the hour
of your own helplessness and pain : There is no
such thing as strengthening medicine, neither in the
earth nor in the waters which are under the earth.
That is the truth ; all the high-class doctors know
it. As for the others, well there ! the less said
about them the better.
Mr. Strong took “strengthening medicines,”
and what happened to him? Why, he “continued
to suffer month after month.” Did you ever see
a horse made stronger and fatter by spurs and
lash-whips, leaving off the oats and hay ? I think
you have not. And that is what “strengthening
medicines ” do, and all they do. So-called tonics
are like making a sick man walk far and fast by
kicking him at every other step.
Nothing under the sun but digested food imparts
strength ; no drug ever does.
And herein is the perpetual success and victory of
Mother Seigel’s Syrup ; it cleanses the system of
disease-poison and leaves Nature sweet and free.
The stomach then cries, “Feed me," and so power
and health come back like the green grass after a
shower. Do you see? Mother Seigel proclaims
“I destroy disease!” Nature responds, “Only
d (that, and I can take care of myself.”
The disease is indigestion and dyspepsia. Mr.
Strong had it and was badly treated. Should you
have it, try the Syrup first —not last, for I have
told you why. Experience.

For power we gather knowledge,

A GOOD STOVE.
A WORD OF CAUTION.
Everyone knows what a good stove is—at least,
the women do ; and every woman knows that, of
all the treasures of the household, a really first-
rate, reliable oooking-stove is the greatest desider-
atum in a house. A great many stoves are
advertised every year, many of which are like
jerry-built houses—thrown together to sell A
word of caution is therefore necessary to intending
buyers, because there are few things so annoying
and vexatious as to buy a stove and then find that
it does not possess all the qualities that are neces-
sary to give complete and lasting satisfaction.
Now, the points in choosing a good stove are: —
1. Strong cast-iron frame.
2. Good draught.
3. Facilities to burn either wood, coal, or
even turf.
4. Simplicity of parts, and thus, easy to clean.
5. Duplicate parts kept in stock, so that
bieakages can be replaced at small cost
and without delay.
And if, in addition to these five points, you can
get a stove that is also an ornament to the kitchen,
all the better.
Price, of course, is a point, but that is a matter
which need scarcely be mentioned, since, if the
above points are combined in any stove, it would
be cheap at any price within reason.
It only remains for us to say that, with con-
fidence, we can honestly recommend “The
Housewife,” sold by Holdsworth, Macpherson
and Co., 250 George-street, Sydney, from <£3 10s.
upwards, as one that fully and entirely “ fills the
bill.”
We should suggest our readers writing to this

I am the Mergenthaler—
“ Merg,” they call me
When they want to be, like me,
Expeditious ;
Like the doom of Ulysses I come
From across the water;
I cast ray lines and build my home upon the
Tottering throne of printerdom.
1 am king, jack and deuce,
With the ace turned,
And am trump at all suits.
When I spring myself
Things had better take a tumble,
For I come to stay.
The poor printer man,
Who used to have to work all night
And then drink beer all day,
Can now have all his time to lush,
For I have
Spilled him out.
His erstwhile sixty lines aWhour, and
Rotatory fat,
Are in the fire, for I can
Double-discount him at his own game.
He is behind the procession,
And unless he learns to
Paw my keyboard
He might as well go dead.
I'm going to make or break
Somebody—and I don’t care-a-
Dam who.
The sand’s in my gizzard
And my dander’s up ;
And if I’m not the winning double, then
What can win ?
Like a nigger,
I’m a good servant
But a bad master,
And if all hands don’t look out
Something’s going to drop.
See !
When I say “ 800 !”
The boys all booze,
And when I sing my little song
They dance,
I si rut in pride
And mock at Faust and Gutenberg ;
For lo!
1 am the Mergenthaler—
And I’m a dizzy swell. —Ex.
M'Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
Wool.— The usual fortnightly sales were held this week.
The offerings, as usual at this time of the year, were made
up chiefly of country scoured assisted by several lots from
local establishments, the greasy portion of the catalogues
comprising odd hales of stragglers and dead wool remnants
of station clips, together with country dealers’ lots. The
whole of the buyers were in attendance, and bidding may
be quoted as on a par with prices current at previous
auctions, though both owners and purchasers seemed
somewhat inclined to hold back for news to be re-
ceived in regard to third series of London sales
opening there on the Ist May, so that a rather
larger proportion than usual of catalogues sub-
mitted from the box were withdrawn, though no doubt
some private sales will be effected. Acting on our own
suggestion, most of our friends with wool in store decided
in favour of holding their parcels until next auctions,
when London news will be public property, and though
we do not mean to say there is much to base any prospect
of a rise upon, still other trades generally have lately
reported a slow yet steady improvement in business, so
that, at all events, we venture to think that a hardening
tendency in prices may be looked for.—Sydney, April 19,
1894.

mine, and blacksmiths’ sheds erected at all the
mines.
The movable tools are estimated at, at least,
£lOOO ; the stores at .£lOOO.
There are 1500 tons of payable ore on the sur-
face, and 2000 tons of matte estimated to contain
40 oz. silver per ton.
The mines are exempt from work (or let on
tribute) until 26th April next, and all workings
are in thorough order.
The assaying and analytical plant is complete in
every requisite and material.
This is the most complete plant for smelting and
concentrating silver ores that has ever been placed
on the Australian markets. The machinery is all
good, and the purchaser may commence operations
without a week’s delay. Fullest enquiries as to
probable success are solicited.
An unfortunate entanglement with the banking
institutions during the late financial crisis, at
which time the capital of the Company had been
called up, forced this Company into liquidation,
the outcome of which is that the property must be
realised upon for the benefit of the creditors.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
It is now 11 years ago. In his first speech
at the very commencement of the tour he crowed,
the little bantam I “My team I your Lordship! my
team I my team ! my team comes ! my team sees! my
team conquers!” And he boasted so that the other
members of the team shot him despairing glances which
said: “Don't give us away like that! For God’s sake
speak more moderately ! Be temperate ! ” But not see-
ing them he crowed and crowed still louder. He reached
the painful and ridiculous climax when he strutted out
upon the floor, waved his hand and shouted, “ Now, Aus-
tralia, step forward and give three cheers for his Lord-
ship. Hip! Hip! HOO-rayl” In the very middle of the
hooray the disgusted glances of Englishmen and Austra-
lian overwhelmed him. The HOO was the bumptious-
toned HOO of a pompous and dapper personage ; the
ray was weak, sickly ; it came from a crushed worm.

The jury in the Hayes v. Australasian case
took care to prove their unfitness for the task. In the
first place, they wanted the Judge to come and have a
quiet chat with them in the jury-room. That was pain-
fully absurd. Then the foreman put a finishing-touch to
the legal farce by reading a paper, the joint production
of six gigantic brains, from which it appeared that the
jury “ recognised the serious loss of time to this honour-
able Court, and the great expense to the country which
has occurred without a more definite result being ob-
tained.” Which side did they imagine to be the
“ country "—jockey Hayes or the newspaper?

Letter ( verbatim ) lately received by a certain
big Australian sweep-promoter:—“Dearsir,—l have sent
an order for a ticket, and I have added 4d. extra for the
return postage, and oh how earnestly I pray that God
will bless and prosper me with good luck this time! I
l ave always believed your works to be fair and honest or
I would not have supported them so long as I have done.
0 i, dear sir, my earnest prayer to God day by day is
t lat He will bless and prosper me with a favourable result.
1 am a believer in prayer and I trust sincerely that God
will bless and prosper me, if it should please him to do
8). To express my gratitude to your works most willingly
do I give you permission to deduct 2s. out of every £1 I
receive after you have taken your discount off; yes 2s. in
every £1 for I am trusting in God’s blessing to prosper
me. My reason for asking His great blessing this time is
because the Building Society has closed and locked up
poor depositor’s money for two or three years, and oh my
sincere prayer is that the Lord will bless me this time.
It, is the Lord alone that knows that I have wrote these
few words to entreat His blessing upon me. May God
bless and prosper me as well as prosper you if you want
it is the sincere prayer of your subscriber and may God’s
blessing rest upon all.” And yet, so hard-hearted is
Providence, after all he didn’t draw a winner. Tatt. is a
callous rascal.

Now that he is “broke” as a publican, efforts
are being made to once more boom Slavin as a boxer ;

His defeat by Hall showed him to have been greatly over-
rated all along. In his cups, Mitchell always bragged
that he could make mince-meat of Slavin, and on the
stage at Liverpool did trounce him. Yet, how did
Mitchell fare against Corbett ?

The camel cannot be abused as a gambling

Rev. Alexander Marshall, of Melbourne, preach-

minimise the betting evils was that, it there must be bet-
ting, there should (1) be no betting till the day of the
race, and (2) that there should be no betting on credit.
These conditions would be secured by one project; that
was the introduction of the totalisator.” A sensible sug-
gestion. But then tar. Marshall proposed that the leading
newspapers should agree not to publish betting-quota-
tions. How childlike! What a harvest there would be
for the sporting press, or for some unregenerate daily
started chiefly for the express purpose of giving fuller turf
news than had ever teen given before 1

In re the recent boxing controversy, the “noble
art ” is without doubt a grand national institution
amongst the “lower classes," where Britishers alone are
congregated. Take the focsle of a ship, for instance. If
two Britishers have a row they are at it in a jiffy, smash-
ing at one another with Nature’s weapons, with no worse
result than a broken nose or black eye. But where the
crews are mixed the Britisher has all the worst of it, as if
he strikes a foreigner the odds are he is knifed. Amongst
the better classes, in the city or 'out of it, boxing is not
much use to a man in a row. The story of the young
British blood who thrashes the bargee for sport is of
frequent occurrence in England—on paper; but the
writer’s experience has been, with very, very few excep-
tions, that the scientific gently-nurtured amateur gets all
over his working man for a few rounds, and just as he
thinks it time his man ought to cry enough, the rough
takes a hand and knocks the stuffing out of the winded
scientist.

It was .Tames Hayes who rode Titan to victory
for the first time after his two-year-old career. This was

then I’ll go to Westralia and ride camels.”

Dear Bulletin, — Tom Durkin’s head of “ An
Attentive Juryman” (in the Hayes libel-case) was an
admirable portrait of a little ex-jockey juror who, some-
how or other, got into the box. Everyone expected a

among the sports present and ruled—evens disagreement,
3 to 1 against Australasian, 7 to 1 against Hayes.—

One Melb. pressman, at least, has a good word
for James Hayes. For the Newmarket and Australian
Cup of '92, the scribe took £5OO to £1 about each of two
doubles, Fortunatus and Portsea, and Fortunatus and
Sternchaser. Hayes got home on the first leg, and the
pressman also saw him do the trick on Portsea.
Jabez Balfour, arrested and taken from

A. 14-year-old lad who stole a “Euclid”
from a Melb. bookstall explained that he wished
to compare it with a different edition which he
was studying at school. The Bench let him off

knowledge so ardently in future.
Another priest yarn—from the French. A
couple went to confession, and while the wife was
recounting her peccadilloes the confessor slept.
The woman had gone and the husband had taken
her place before the good father awoke. Not

were we ? Oh, I know, you were telling me you
had deceived your husband ! ”

The Meat Export Trade:
The old-time squatter has faded in the light ot
science—or the darkness of finance. The days
when it was the ambition of every match-making
mamma that “dear Jane” or “sweet Lionise”
should marry a squatter; when the squatter
was the type of all that was powerful, and
patriarchal, and princely; when his port was
erect, his shipments direct, and his credit-balance
rarely failed of five figures; have passed away,
never to return. The new-time pastoralist is a
careful, anxious man, harassed by murrain and
mortgage, drought and flood, foot-rot and pleuro;
with the fatal shears of strike-organisers, like
pastoral Parcae, ever raised to sever his slender
thread; and with the rhythmic burden of ten-
per-cent. continually ringing in his ears.
The national policy of Australia, opposed to the
aggregation of vast estates in the hands of a few
monopolists, proposes to replace one great squatter
by a thousand small graziers, and to breed men
instead of sheep. The change is not to be
regretted ; but to be successful it must be gradual.
The pastoral industry is still the leading Austra-
lian industry, and no sudden reversal of its con-
ditions can take place without shock and loss to
the whole community. But the pastoralists them-
selves are preparing for the change. Most of
them even now would prefer to work profitably a
comparatively small area of land which they could
certainly call their own, rather than nourish a
vast estate for a dozen years, spend time and toil
and money to improve it, and see it fall into the
hands of a mortgagee at last.
The current N.S.W. movement for the utilisa-
tion of surplus stock in the shape of frozen meat,
to be exported and sold at a low price in European
markets, is on all-fours with the similar enterprise
in Maoriland, now firmly established, which has
done so much to forward the past five years’ pros-
perity in that province. The system offers the
best possible means for the establishment of the
small farmer. The present writer last year met,
on an ocean-liner, a young Englishman who had
emigrated seven years before and leased 200 acres
of land near Wellington. In 1893 he had raised
and fattened 520 sheep, which returned him 13s.
per head nett, or >£3BB. He started with £2OO

If the meat export trade can similarly profit
New South Wales farmers, the work of the newly-
initiated Graziers’ Meat Export Company, whose
prospectus appears in this week’s Bulletin, may
fairly be denominated “a national undertaking.”
The excellent articles by Mr. Cuthbert Fether-
stonhaugh, collected in pamphlet form by the
Pastobalists’ Review, leave little doubt of the
Company’s success, and no doubt whatever that
some such company must succeed if the pastoral
industry is to rise from the slough of despond in
which every year under existing circumstances
sees it more steadily settling. Singularly enough,
the only real obstacle in the way of remunerative
meat export from New South Wales is the supine-
ness of those who should themselves be meat
exporters, and whose inactivity in the present
crisis is as disadvantageous to their interests as it
is discreditable to their enterprise.

Melbourne Eight Hours’ commemoration
was this year spoilt by a dreary Scotch mist.
There were no additions to the procession, which
fact, as it recurs now every year, suggests the
reflection that perhaps the Eight Hours victory
has been celebrated enough, and that it is about
time the Trades Unions stopped crowing over the
little concession gained nearly 40 years ago.
“ Labour Day ” would be a far more consistent
and comprehensive workers’ celebration. Also,
whooping at the reigning monarch’s representa-
tive, stuck up at a window, should be strictly pro-
hibited. The Typographical Society, of all others,
was the only one that stopped in a body and
whooped for Hopetoun. The Jingo cheer was led
by Hancock, too, if The Bulletin mistakes not.
As usual, pioneers, &0., headed the procession in

Was the salute tendered to King Solomon by his people.
Nevertheless Solomon the Wise died at a comparatively
early age, because he did not know how to care for that
most important organ of the human body, the liver, which
has justly been considered the great centre of life’s
machinery. In it is stored the nutriments absorbed
during digestion, which is gradually given out into the
blood to keep up the vigor of the human organism. When
the Liver ceases to do its work the head is heavy, thoughts
come slowly, the tongue is dirty, mouth tastes foul, appetite
is poor; sleep is disturbed, bile circulates in the blood,
causing a yellow tinge in the skin and eruptions, fits of
coughing, slimy expectorations, and pains in the right side.
If this condition is not checked, the consequences will be
serious to the sufferer. The best and never-failing remedy is

will find it an invaluable home remedy, it being an efficacious aperient

Capital, £250,000
In 250,000 SHARES OF £1 EACH (WITH POWER TO INCREASE).
No Shareholder will have any Liability beyond the amount of One Pound per Share on the Shares he applies for.
First issue of SHARES upon the following terms
2s. 6d. on application, 2s. 6d. on allotment, the balance in calls not exceeding 2s. 6d. per share as may be required
in terms of the Articles of Association.
The Company may be declared floated when 60,000 shares have been applied for.
It is proposed to forthwith issue 5 per cent. Debentures for the purpose of providing additional capital, in order
to carry out the objects of the Company, such Debentures forming a first charge on the freeholds, leaseholds, plant,
and uncalled capital of the Compan}’, and giving to the holders thereof a voting power in connection with the
administration of the affairs of the Company, in accordance with the powers conferred on them by the Articles of
Association.
Several Banks have agreed to take up Debentures aggregating £30,000 conditionally on Share Capital to the
extent of £lOO,OOO and Debenture Capital to the extent of £50,000 being subscribed in addition.
This Company is initiated under the auspices of the principal Banks and Pastoral Institutions, who recommend it
to their constituents and to the sheep farmers of New South Wales as a NATIONAL UNDERTAKING, based on
sound business lines, and one that, economically managed by its Directors-who will be appointed by the shareholders
and debenture holders—should return fair interest on its capital, and, in addition, give a satisfactory minimum value
to stock, and, as a consequence, to pasture land.
The recommendations and data embodied in this Prospectus are the outcome of an exhaustive inquiry made by
the following Executive Committee, appointed by a General Committee elected at a Public Meeting held in Sydney on

On the formation of the Company the Shareholders and Debenture-holders will be called together for the purpose
of electing its Board of Directors, in terms of the Articles of Association. The Head Office of the Company will be in
Q om p any being formed for the purpose of exporting or otherwise dealing with meat and other produce in a
frozen or preserved state, or treated by any other process which may be found advisable, and to act as Agents for the
Grazier or Exporter, reserving to itself power, if necessary, to purchase and export on its own account.
It is proposed that this shall be essentially a Graziers’ Company—at the same time the Company will be empowered
to issue Shares at the discretion of the Directors to persons not immediately connected with the grazing industry.
The system that has been adopted by the Committee, after careful consideration, as the safest and most econo-
mical, is that of killing and chilling at a number of inland works, and freezing and storing for shipment in large central
factories at port; but should works be erected at comparatively near distances to the seaboard, it may at such works
be deemed advisable to freeze outright and rail direct to the ships.
In arriving at this decision the Committee acted on the principle that the first axiom in preparing meat for export
is TO KILL THE STOCK AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR OWN PASTURES, and this can be best effected by
adopting the Inland Chilling system, under which some NINE INLAND CHILLING WORKS can be erected at the
same cost as THREE INLAND FREEZING WORKS.
Together with the Inland Chilling Works it is proposed to erect all necessary adjuncts, such as boiling-down and
blood and manure plant, tinning, and, if deemed advisable, fellmongery plant.
The attention of Pastoralists is specially directed to the fact that the enhancement in the value of FAT STOCK,
resulting from a large export, will equally apply to STORE STOCK, for which a large increased demand must follow.
Every carcase exported will tend to improve the value of the remainder, while the ready means of disposal will
accentuate the importance of breeding early-maturing stock ; and thus, by enlarging the turnover, render grazing
lands more profitable, and further result in securing to graziers a satisfactory minimum price tor surplus stock.
The number of Inland Chilling Works will necessarily depend on the amount of capital subscribed—THE MORE
CAPITAL THE MORE WORKS. The Directors will appoint a thoroughly experienced and competent General
Manager to superintend the business from the outset.
This Company hopes, by effecting a reduction in the charges, insurance, and freight, to be able to put meat on the
Heme market, from works 350 miles inland, at a consolidated rate of not over 2d. per lb., and eventually rather under.
That an immense future lies before the meat export trade of Australia can be inferred ;
Ist. From the enormous expansion of the frozen meat trade in New Zealand, which, commencing in 1882
with an export valued at £54,000, increased in 1885 to an export of half a million sheep, valued at
£345,000, and culminated in 1891 in the enormous output of nearly TWO MILLION SHEEP, valued at
£1,200,000.
2nd. From the fact that the prejudice against frozen mutton is steadily dying out.
3rd. That, as yet, our mutton has scarcely reached the masses, and that when good mutton can be retailed
at 4£d. per lb. they will, without doubt, become large consumers.
4th, That if hut 5 per cent, of the population of the United Kingdom become increased meat consumers to
the extent of only 11b. a week each, we shall barely be able to supply their requirements.
Bth. That if the Continental armies would but take the article—and it can be supplied at far less than it
can be produced on the Continent—the whole resources of Australia would be taxed to supply these
armies alone.
oth. That there are other countries which are likely, within a few years, to become customers for our meat -
to wit, Japan, China, Canada, eto.
We shall probably have in New South Wales an average annual surplus of over eight million sheep to dispose of,
in the shape of some three million fats for colonial consumption, two million freezers for export, and three million in
the shape of tallow and tinned meat. Of the latter three million, however, we may reasonably hope to export frozen
at least one million at no very distant date.
If this great NATIONAL UNDERTAKING he supported by sheep farmers and those connected with them in
business and be carried to a successful issue, then the advance in values of fat and store stock cannot be less than
from 20 to 25 per cent., while the value of every acre of good grazing freehold or conditionally-purchased land would
be raised proportionately. An advance, say, of 20 per cent, all round on the eight and a half million surplus sheep of
the colony amounts to nearly half a million sterling per annum, an enormous return on a capital of £250,000. IF
EVERY SHEEP PARMER IN NEW SOUTH WALES WOULD TAKE SHARES TO THE EQUIVALENT OF
EVEN ONE PENNY PER HEAD ON EACH SHEEP, THE AMOUNT THUS RAISED WOULD PROVIDE THE
NECESSARY CAPITAL. . , t .
To secure good and steady prices it is essential that shipments be concentrated in the hands of as few consignees
as possible. The market can then be steadied and controlled.
In recognition of the principle that shareholders should enjoy special privileges, the Company proposes to grant
them—(lst) a preference over non-shareholders in the_ treatment of their stock, and (2nd) such concessions on a fair
and proportionate basis and in such form as may hereinafter be decided.
The preliminary expenses will be kept as iow as possible. No promotion commissions have been incurred; the
Company, therefore, can obtain a quick, clean, unfettered start.
The Articles of Association can be inspected at the Offices of the Company, or at Messrs. Johnson, Minter,
Simpson, and Co.’s, Hunter-street, Sydney.
Applications for Shares will be received by the Acting-Secretary at the offices of the Company, 7 O’Oonnell-street,
Sydney, and by the Managers of the Branches of the following Banks throughout the colony;

Pending the allotment of shares, Messrs. W. A. Oottee and T, P. Knox, acting: as Trustees, will receive all moneys
on behalf of the Company. . . , . .......
Every holder of 25 shares or more will be entitled to one vote tor every share held by him, and allotments of less
than 25 shares will not be made.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
*‘ Wait,” said the bride. She was young and fair
Fair as a dear, delicious rose
Which, like a recluse inardent, blows
Veiled from the sun and the grosser air.
“Wait, for my husband is old and grey,
Bent is his back, and his step is slow ;
Soon he will sleep with the earthworms low.
Wait, oh ! my love, for another day.”
“Wait,” said the wife. She was fair and round.
“ Wait, for the years we lose are few ;
Yet we are young, and our world is new,
But he—he is moving towards the mound.”
“ Wait,” said the wife. She was hale and red.
“ Wait. Though thy sorrow is plain to see ;
Time, w ho hath seasons of joy for thee,
Striketh his scythe at that old, grey head.”
Over a mound in a graveyard lone,
Chuckling with glee on the mouldy bed,
Straddleth a man with an old, grey head.
‘ Waiting ” is writ on the chiselled stone.

“ The only person who can cure one of a

Melb. Age says that “ the defence of
India is a problem intimately connected with
Australian defence.” What is the connection
between a country of black people, controlled by
a British army and always threatened by a neigh-
bouring Power, and a sea-protected continent like
Australia, where militarism is merely a Tory
excrescence? The conditions of Indian govern-
ment are unique, and the Age’s rigmarole about
the proportion of resident white troops to black
troops has no more bearing upon Victorian defence
than the appetite of the Emperor of China has
upon i If Australian rabbit question.
Melb. Age once dealt thusly with a poet
who pressed hard for a notice. “We have
received a volume of verse by —" av . e
much pleasure in saying that the spelling is
unexceptionable !”
Theorists who would move on towards
Australian Federation by first establishing an
interprovincial customs union should note that,
under present Australian political constitutions,
there is no authority given to impose discrim-
inative duties even between the Australias, and
that all Acts attempting such a change would
have to be reserved for a foreign “Queen’s con-
sent.” Whether is easier, the struggle for a
number of small piecemeal Acts, each to be thus
humiliatingly reserved, or to attempt one com-
prehensive change, including all others, or power
to make all others, and coercing our present
foreigh proprietor to assent to it? Does the above
language insult Australians in their self-esteem .
The Bulletin hopes so, since it is only a mild
representation of the truth about Australia s
despicable condition of dependency upon a foreign
owner—a freckle on the other side of the globe.

it is well-known that Herr Rassmnssen, the
Celebrated Danish Herbalist, has devoted most of
his lifetime to the study of preparing excellent
remedies from medical herbs, and the thousands
of Permanent Cures effected by his Alfaline
Remedies, especially Blood and Nerve Affec-
tions, Rheumatism, Piles, and
Debility and Nervousness
has made the name of Herr Rassmnssen familiar
and welcome in every Australian household, and
the general verdict of the Australian public and
press is, that “Herr Rassmnssen has, for the last
ten years, served us well and faithfully, and cured
more sufferers than all others put together,” and,
considering that he has received over
100,000 Testimonials,

HERR RASSMUSSEN, PH.D.
A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Herr Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as “The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
mussen succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
scon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Alfaline Remedies, suffice it to say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depfit, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in his celebrated work, “ The
Natural Doctor.”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist—his last
ten years record being so wonderful that his
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor ; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially for the nerves, and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Corr. Mem. of the Academic Parisienne des
Inventeurs, France ; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893 ; and in 1891 he issued his
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.
When My Hair Goes Up.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down,
O the gay girl that I shall be !
I will make a bonfire of tiresome books,
Dragging them out from their hidden nooks —
Grammar and history, French and all—
For they’ll be no use when I grow quite tall ;
So I’ll pile them on as the flames upspring
And in the blaze I will dance and sing
To the wildest tune, in the shrillest key—
I shall be the happiest girl in the town
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down.
And lovers will come, will come by the score
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down.
But I will be haughty, so haughty, and cold
That the boldest among them shall grow less bold;
I will frown—like this—and stamp my foot,
And into ray glance such scorn I will pub,
They shall sigh all day, and toss all night,
While ever their pain will be my delight
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down.
Let them call me coquette—l will plague them
more !
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down.
Yet—if there is one—l do not say—
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down—
One who is gentle and brave alway,
With plenty of money, a soul without guile
(I should like him to dress to suit my style),
Tall —to be sure; and wit must not lack,
And his eyes will have to be black, quite black ;
And if he plays planet, and lets me oe sun—
Mind, I do not promise—but if there is one—
Why, I’ll be the happiest girl in the town
When my hair goes up, and my skirts go down.

Any manager to any squatter;—“ Sir, I
beg to apply for the post of manager on your
station. I have had twenty years’ experience in
management, and can honestly say I have never
met my match. Should you favourably con-
sider this application, I will have pleasure in
breeding horses of my own on your station, and
by putting a higher price on yours will be able to
dispose of mine readily. If carriers prefer yours,
I will give them no wool until their judgment
improves. Should any part of your run be
unfortunately opened for selection, I will secure
it by putting the bailiffs on at your expense, re-
taining the deeds for myself. After shearing I
will let the storekeeper have the screenings at a
low figure, and stand in with him for the profit.
Should I invite some ladies from the township to
come out and have a picnic, and find unexpectedly
that you would b« visiting the station just then, of
course I should be glad to postpone the picnic.
I have had a great deal to do in lambing, and
know exactly how to make the squatters get small
percentages, while selectors’ ewes have three and
four lambs apiece. During mustering it is my
practice to rush the sheep all over the run at the
pace Carbine went when he won the Cup. This
prevents the accumulation of too heavy fleeces,
which are very unhealthy for sheep in hot weather.
In conclusion, I may say that I have no doubt
that I can, by judicious management, reduce the
carrying capacity of your run from 350,000 to
150,000 in less than two years, and remain, yours
hopefully ” —Baldt Jobson,

G. R. Sims, in London Referee : “I
know one man in England at the present moment
who makes two thousand a year comfortably out
of a paraffin preparation for the hair and judicious
advertisement, and who before I made ray dis-
covery public was behind the counter of a chemist’s
shop. Why, O why, did I not keep the remedy
for baldness to myself ? ” Sirns has deluded him-
self into the idea that he discovered paraffin as a
hair-stimulant, whereas wonderful stories on the
same subject were in print several years before the
Ref. started or the cockney dramatist had been
heard of. It was said that shiny-headed men
working in paraffin factories, had acquired dense
crops of hair through the trade habit of wiping
their oily fingers on the skull from time to time.
So much for the origin of the paraffin “cure,”
which doesn’t seem to be recognised by medical
science. Dr. Pincus, a recognised German authority
upon disease of the hair, or rather, of the hair-
cells, declares that he can do nothing for the person
whose wool has wasted out of sight. Pincus says,
“ Almost all my patients have used stimulants for
months before coming to me (spirits, brandy, eau-
de-cologne, castor-oil), and have done themselves
much harm. All these stimulants shorten the
existence of the hair, or to make use of a meta-
phor, they exhaust the hair-soil. I wish to caution
against these tonics. The diseased head-skin can-
not endure them. It is not weakness, but a diseased
irritation that has to be dealt with, and our task is
to cure this; or if it is no longer possible, at
least to lessen it. Many people come to me, sup-
posing me to have a certain ‘ hair remedy.’ There
are no such remedies; there are certain medica-
ments which counteract the causes of premature
wasting, shortening, and thinning.” The shorten-
ing and thinning of each individual hair on the
affected portions, almost invariably the front and
crown, of the head, is the beginning of baldness in
every case. But so much for the German
specialist. If anyone can solemnly testify to a
case in which baldness, of two or three years’
standing, has been cured by the application of
paraffin— i.e., a case of hair growing thickly
where hair had previously disappeared in a slow
and seemingly “natural” way—then it follows
that Dr. Pincus knows nothing about his subject,
and the sinful, old ballet-gloater in the front row
of the stalls may anoint himself with lamp-oil in
defiance of medical treatises.
CONFIRMATION STRONG I
STILL ANOTHER TESTIMONIAL II
NO APPEAL FROM THE POPULAR
VERDICT III
“There is no appeal from the popular verdict—
the people think and judge for themselves.” The
Waterbury Watch Company once more “comes
out on top.” Here is valuable and incontrovert*
ible testimony from a New South Wales colonist,
Mr. John Archer writes as follows from Rylstone,
under date of April 2, 1894
“ The Ladies' Waterbury Watch came safely to
hand. It is going well, and keeping good time, as
the Waterbury Watches always do. If I was ever
so rich it is a Waterbury Watch that I should carry,
as I find that they are quite as good as any high-
priced watch, and they always give satisfaction. ”
This is a fair sample of hundreds of testimonials
that are being received every week, and reason-
ably so, for the new perfected quick-winding
Waterbury meets all the requirements of an ideal
low-priced watch. The new Waterbury is a watch
with the best features of a high-priced timepiece,
yet at only a fraction of the cost. It is an accurate
timekeeper, while taste, elegance, and genuineness
are combined in its outward appearance. The
Waterbury watch can be obtained in every style—
nickel, coin-silver, and goldfilled.

At Sydney Lyceum, “The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray ” continues with unabated patronage,
and the performance has improved until it stands
one of which any company might be proud. Mrs.
Brough remains better in the first two acts, which
suit her powers, than in the last two, which do
not. Contrast, for example, the absolute perfec-
tion of her speech beginning “ What is my life?”
with her comparative ineffectiveness in the final
duologue with Aubrey. Her very naturalness
tells against the artistic finish of her rendering;
since (the best art is so refine and spiritualised
as to be beyond nature, or so as, rather, to
reach that highest expression of nature which is
too rare to be easily understood. Mr. Bouci-
cault has modified by a shade his juvenile en-
thusiasm, and for him and Mr. Titheradge there
is little but praise. Mr. Renouf remains unsatis-
factory. His make-up is not military, and not
romantic, and one cannot conceive such a hasty
and commonplace lover as realising the enthusiastic
ideals of Ellean. Mr. Carey and Mr. Mclntyre
fill small parts well; and the others, particularly
Mr. Ward and Miss Temple, deserve much
credit.
• * •
Several Beasts in the audience attract par-
ticular attention. There is the Beast who will
persist in . applauding loudly exactly when the
action of the piece demands silence, as if it helped
an actor or actress to be interrupted at a critical
moment by expressions of appreciation which is
generally unintelligent, and which in any case could
be restrained till the close of the act. Then there is
the Beast who does not hear what is said, and
who asks his wife, in a loud whisper, “ What was
that?” and when she replies, in a loud whisper,
laughs “Hu ! Hu ! Hu!” to the distraction of 19
people round about him. There is also a numerous
Beast who bubbles oyer with mirth in the tragic
parts, and goes into a fit of laughter when Ellean
enters to announce the death of Paula. It is
probably to suit this Beast that the orchestra
invariably plays the audience out with something
light and cheerful, jarring anybody whom the
play has really impressed just as it jars one to
miscalculate the bottom step and tread on air.
With these drawbacks, “The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray ” is a pronounced success.
** * *
“ The Lights of London” still twinkle at
Her Majesty’s to steady business. Also,
the wild warbler mysteriously described on the
programme as “ A Voice,” who sings Louis Diehl’s
ballad on the subject from the bowels of the
theatre, nightly exemplifies the attraction of the
hidden vocalist as compared with the re-
vealed article standing gasping before you
and holding its music like a pound of
loose tea. The hidden singer suggests angels—
the revealed generally reminds you of angles. It
is really interesting to observe how even a medium
voice gains in general listenableness when the
owner thereof is singing beneath a bushel. King

“ Lights of London ” go out.

Sydney Bijou, Criterion, Opera House,
and Standard are now closed, awaiting better
times. The Royal opens again on Saturday, after
a week’s intermission, with the Holloway Co. on
the boards, and “Judge Not ” as the play. Harry
Rickards’ co., at the Tivoli, continues to thrive on
its own merits and others’ misfortunes, and the
entertainment, brightened by new stars, is one of
the best variety shows that Sydney has seen.
Fillis’s Circus season approachesjts close, but the
performances are still well patronised, and deserve
all their patronage.
** * *
Owing to the weather, and other causes,
“A Woman’s Revenge” has not been a huge
success at Melbourne Princess’s, nor does Bland
Holt’s latest improve much on acquaintance. The
play is a careful collection of things that are old
and unrealistic in dramatic effect, capped by a
seriously impossible trial for murder in the Old
Bailey. It is a consistent work, insofar that the
people who can be moved by the first three acts
are bound to be impressed by the trial scene, and
vice versa. The nature of the plot prepares them
for the trial, whilst the picturesque fallacies of
that judicial ceremony are worthy of the previous
course of events. One genuine touch of nature is
discernable in “A Woman’s Revenge. The
murderer’s name, Jepthah Grimwade, compels
him to mis-doing, and although the possessor of a
Scriptural cognomen usually draws the line at
financial fraud, and contents himself with cleaning
out the depositors, it is clear from the outset that
if blood must be shed during the evening,
Jepthah has a baptismal right to do the deed.
Jepthah figures at the trial as chief witness
for the prosecution, but his guilty conscience is
oozing out of him all the time, and his manner
invites mistrust. . When Judge Windeyer has
summed up in a couple of lines, and the squared
iury have acquitted Miss Watson without leaving
the box, nobody wonders at hearing his Honor
order the clammy Jepthah into custody. One
almost expects to see the common hangman sum-
moned right away by the Attorney-General in
order that Jepthah aforesaid may be executed on
the premises before the curtain falls. For nothing
was impossible with the late dramatist, Pettitt.
W Baker’s rendering of the craven criminal has
gained a little force and vigour since the opening
night, also Sass’s speech for the defence is given
with more earnestness, but neither of these minor-
key actors displays his stagey part to the best
ad'vantage. Cosgrove does very well as the ever-
lasting villain who plots with “papers’ and
gloats over the fact that the game is in his own
hands, whilst Bland Holt and the ladies are
all of them at home in characters they have
olaved in at least a dozen other dramas
under different names. The hit of the piece is
little Brightie Smith, a reliable child-actress, who
says and does all that she has been taught to say
and do in the exact way prescribed by her
teachers, and who is very natural, or perfectly
mechanical, just as one chooses to regard the
damsel. Clever mounting and stage-management
are the unbroken rule with Bland Holt’s shows,
and the present spectacle is admirably conducted.
On the first night the thunderstorm was marred
by the enthusiasm of an unseen Jove, who be-
laboured a big-drum after each flash of lightning,
but since then the elements have been under the
personal supervision of 8.H., and their resem-
blance to the Salvation Harmy has terminated.
But the storm rages for the last time on Friday.
On Saturday “The Prodigal Daughter,” which is
a cheerful play, will present a new phase of a
woman’s vengeance.
** * *
“Charley's Aunt,” from Brazil, re-
appeared at the Bijou last Saturday, and the
theatre was nearly crowded. The promise of a
few alterations in the cast would, no doubt, have
brought a packed house, but seeing that the two
young University Johnnies and their lady loves
turned out to be the same as before, an excited
rush was out of the question. Thornton goes far,
yet he doesn’t make up for all the shortcomings of
his company, who had created a considerable sense
of disappointment in Melbourne by the time their
first season was through. However, “Charley’s
Aunt” is a notoriously good joke, well worth
hearing for a second time, and she ought to flourish
for seven months, or so. By-the-way, what are
those “awful things ” that the amorous guardian
is alleged to say to Auntie when he chases her
round ?
** * *
“The Octoroon” is keeping the colour
question to the fore at Melbourne Alexandra.
Boucicault’s tricky old drama likewise diffuses
new light upon the suicide question, for Dan
Barry has arranged a heavenly ascension of the
heroine who poisons herself. The apotheosis that
served for little Eva, a fortnight ago, is recon-
structed to suit Zoe, and up she goes at 11 p.ra.
Just now, when the Church of England seems
disposed to revive damnation for all self-
destroyers, the broadness of D. Barry’s views will
arouse discussion in theological circles, and
it may be as well to mention that Daniel is nob
related to the bishop who bears his name. A
stealthy, relentless Red Indian (played by Speed,
the music-hall identity) is an important feature of
“The Octoroon.” He follows E. B. Russell
through some cane-brakes and changes of scenery
with a baleful eye, and his burst of gibberish, as
he plants his moccasin upon the chest of ms dead
prey, makes a favourable impression. “Queens
Evidence ” is billed for Saturday.
** * *
The last nights of “Struck Oil” are
announced at Melb. Theatre Royal, but there is
still a lively struggle for front seats in the temple
of Maggie Moore. It is therefore probable that
the last nights will be extended over a sixth week,
after which a new musical drama -by a local
author.

Madame Belle Cole’s English Concert
Company, now in Adelaide, are due at Melb.
Town Hall on Saturday. Madame Cole is an
American. Her colleagues comprise a noted
’Murkan-born soprano, a tenor of Dunedin reputa-
sion an Irish basso, and a Dutch lady who plays
the violin- But these artists collectively form an
English Company.
At Poverty Point.
The address of Mr. Boothroyd Pairclough is requested
by Mr. W. J. L. Sinclair, solicitor, Adelaide, in re an un-
claimed-property matter.
Mrs. Brown-Potter’s beautiful oopper-brown hair is now
thickly streaked with grey.
Alice Holbrook, so persistently and undeservedly
boomed in London, probably owes it to the fact that she
is sister-in-law to B. Barnato, the millionaire diamond-
merchant.
Dan Barry has followed the usual custom of putting up
“The Octoroon” after a good run of “ Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” and will probably reap the usual disappointment.
Uncle Tom, to a certain class, is a sentimental fetish, but
the very same class only regard “The Octoroon” as un-
mitigated rubbish. Managers never thoroughly realise
how much they owe to Mrs. Beecher Stowe in the matter.
Miss Helen Rowe, of Melbourne, threatens to make a
name for herself in London as a contralto.
British Australasian speaks of Johnny Toole as
“beloved by Australian and English playgoers alike.”
M’yes. Ask the firm.
Alfred Moul (once musical critic of Melb. Age) is now
manager of London Alhambra.
Camilla Urso, as per her Coliins-street portraits, deve-
lopes a cheerfully Ansonian likeness.
Old Madame Carandini’s death is cabled. She warbled
in Sydney somewhere up to half a century ago, and thou-
sands in fairy gold trickled through her fingers in auri-
ferous Melbourne. Her husband is termed a Marchese in
the obituary advt., but, all the same, he danced as
harlequin in Tom Pavey’s first Melb. Royal pantomime
in 1855. Madame was born in England, and arrived in
Tasmania as a girl. She was the mother of some of the
most charming women, both as to appearance and manner,
by whom Australia has yet been graced.
The once well-known Madame Sibley, mesmerist, etc.,
died last week near Tenterfield, where for some years she
had kept a small store.
Since the Melb. theatres have played at reduced prices,
the various amateur dramatic clubs have "shrivelled”
one by one for want of public support.
Pretty Hilda Spong says, in a recent Maoriland inter
view, that “she lives for nothing but her art and her
ma.”
Jennie Lee is the first Thespienne of repute to strike
Coolgardie. “Jo ” opens there shortly in a tent.
Thornton and Arnold have done very well at Adelaide
Royal, though the “Private Secretary” did not prove
nearly so successful as “Charley’s Aunt.”
Walter Bentley would have made a hit as the murderer
In “ A Woman’s Revenge,” and Bland Holt must now
regret that he didn’t engage an actor so competent to
deal with tragic parts, instead of leaving Garner to snap
him up.
The late Hans van Billow is said to have been very
grateful to Wagner for eloping with his (Von Billow’s)
wife. This erring lady had a changeable disposition, as
became the daughter of her amorous father, Liszt, and
after she had taken herself off with quite unnecessary
secrecy, the deserted husband declared himself dead in
the matter and called her his “poor widow.” Yet there
are dull, mercantile fools who deny that genius and
common sense can co-exist. Who has ever heard a city
man speak of his own relict, with a beaming countenance
and a twinkle in his sordid eye? He howls and scowls
merely because he became insufferable to the woman who
went away.
Qiieerly enough, the horror of being crushed under a
lift which Vi. Varley realised in Melb., is being acted in
London by Marion Terry. It forms the chief sensation in
the new Adelphi drama, “ A Cotton King,” by Sutton
Yane, who is looked upon as Pettitt’s successor.
Wyalong gold-rush has a tent-theatre already, where
Fred. Davys pulls the strings of the marionettes. He has
already bought a claim out of his takings. Not an average
Wyalong claim, Tub Bulletin hopes.
It is hinted in Melbourne that the jury in “The
Woman’s Revenge ” has been squared.
Mr. John Thompson, baritone, son of Bookie Joe
Thompson, is engaged by Edward Terry, for the new bur-
lesque of “King Kodaok,” in London. Joe went to Eng-
land to cultivate the vocalism of his daughter, Leah, who
did not train kindly.
The Salvation Army band of a very small town in
Victoria once tried to shut up Fitzgerald Brothers’ circus
by blowing tunes outside the tent, and praying generally
for the salvation of all hands, including Commodore, the
lions and the advertising agent. The prayers were more
than audible inside the tent, and pious exhortations
and allusions to the devil got mixed up with the clown s
iokes while the sacred hymns and solemn tunes of the
band outside interspersed themselves with polkas, gallops
and quadrilles by the band inside. At last a circus
arrived—no, a crisis—and the whole of the company
inside with the band at their head, ranged themselves
outside the tent and opposite to the Salvation Army
band. The spectators inside came outside also, and
ranged themselves with the rest of the town (which had
been trying to get in under the canvas without paying) to
watch the proceedings. Both bands struck up simul-
taneously two different tunes in separate keys. The
clown and the Salvation captain harangued, the tambor-
ines banged, the horses neighed, and the lions roared.
At last, the circus bandmaster, Herr Von der Mehden,
blew one terrific blast on the cornet, at which the Salva-
tion Army, thinking the last trump had sounded, fled
precipitately, leaving the circus in possession.
William Archer says there are a hundred dramatic
moments in “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray ” worth all the
attitudinising situations ever conceived. The play, in his
opinion, is absorbing, but not moving. “ Not once during
the whole evening were the tears anywhere near ray eyes.
Yes, once—when Mr. Pinero came before the curtain, and
the house rose at him. Then I felt a thrill of genuine
emotion to think that here at last, in spite of all the
depressing and stunting influences of our English thea-
trical world, was a man who had had the will and the
talent to emancipate himself and give the artist within
him free play—to take care of his soul, and let his pocket,
for the nonce, take care of itself.” Which reminds Tub
Bulletin that divoroe-Judge Windeyer absolutely wept
at the first performance of Mrs. Tanqueray in Sydney.
Both Argus and Age have lately changed their dramatic
critics.
Mrs. Patrick Campbell, London’s “Second Mrs. Tan-
queray,” has been getting £5O a week from George
Alexander. She goes next to Beerbohm Tree for £6O a
week, and when he starts his American tour will get £BO,
Melb. Royal has been crammed nightly since Maggie
“Struck Oil.” On many nights the house has yielded
£230, which, at the present low prices, is its utmost
worth.
Encouraged by the success of Manning’s Westralian
operatic venture, Williamson and Musgrove contemplate
sending their singers West about August.
When “ Professor ” Baldwin and his clairvoyants wife
were in Brisbane, they fairly squandered a smart press-
man who boasted he had in his hand an unanswerable
sealed query. The clairvoyants went through the usual
“ business,” and jerkt d out: “ I see a man, his face con-
cealed in a sort of iron shield ; his enemies seek his life.”
And then Baldwin: “Any gentleman in the audience
want to know about a man going around in an iron face-
guard?” “Yes,” replied the pressman ; “ I asked who
was the man in the iron mask.” The clairvoyants waded
in again; “I see policemen shooting at him; he fires
back. Alas ! he is seized.” This new rendering of an old
story was not explained till the lady in a trance climaxed
her brain-vision with the words: “Itis, yes—” “ Who?”
queried Baldwin. “Ned Kelly!” Then the pressman
went out to ruminate on the nothingness of encyclopaedic
knowledge.
Cabled that George Edwards’ London burlesque co-
visits Australia next year, engaged by the duumvirate.
New songs, new legs, new dances. Joy 1
Fitzgerald Bros.’ Circus caught on in Launceston
recently. When the brothers were counting up the
takings, they found a number of two shilling pieces, which
had been in use as brooches and from which the pin
attachments had been wrenched. A melancholy sign of
the times.
The success of Madame Melba, Frances Saville and other
Australians goes to upset the old theory that a meat-
eating people cannot produce great singers—founded on
observation and comparison of the meat and corn-pro-
ducing districts of Italy and Norway.
A recent production of “Maritana” at Perth was
honoured with a 1J col. notice in the West Australian.
The critic started off by describing the circumstances that
led to the writing of the opera in 1845 ; then came a dis-
quisition on the rival merits of “Maritana” and “The
Bohemian Girl,” followed by a few remarks upon British
music In general, and finally a burst of hysterics
over the unparalleled performance of Leumane, Marie
Elster and company. It seems to have been about the
best show in the whole annals of drowsy Perth, where old
friend Julius Herz has begun to teach them the art of
chorus-singing.
Florence Young goes to London soon.
“ Every effort is being made to eschew the abominable
system of bringing into prominence one or two star artists
surrounded by a bundle of sticks, and aspire to a com-
bination of all-round excellence made all the stronger by
the energy and loyalty inseparable from the true artist.”

With Edith Blande, Annie Taylor and Jenny Watt-
Tanner as heavy-weights in Arthur Garner’s new 00., and
Garner and Harwood on the male side, one wonders where
the light comedy element is to squeeze in.
Universal title for melodrama—“ Falsely Accused.”
Herbert Flemming is with Warner, at the Adelphi.
Where is ? Well, no matter.
The human tableaux, shown at London Empire, are
secured by Williamson for Australia.
Ryley having long itched for London, Williamson
engages Brownlow to replace him.
On dit that Victoria’s favourite soprano is not going to
Europe! Things in the benefit line did not pan out as
expected; too closely following the recent big emptying
of sympathetic pockets on Eva Crossley’s behalf.
Arthur Roberts comes with the Gaiety troupe to Wil-
liamson and M. All Lonnen’s plod cannot bring him to
the level of Leslie and Roberts, who may fairly be
bracketed with departed Fred. Roberts is more even
than Leslie in being a born improvisatore, whereas Leslie
had to con every effect, like a schoolboy, or fancied he
must do so. He was afraid of being spontaneous. Roberts
has a kaleidoscopic revelry in the scene.
The absolutely best things in “ A Woman’s Revenge ”
are George Gordon’s bit of Devonshire north coast in
Act 1,, and Henrietta Watson’s neck.
Arthur Garner, Walter Bentley and Phil. Stuart
(Garner’s Bijou biz. manager) inspected the house on the
first night of returned “ Charley’s Aunt ” with evident
interest. It was a big crowd, considering the comnany,
and the trio thought it a useful housewarming.
Now it leaks out that England and
Portugal tried to put Humpty Dumpty up again,
in the Brazilian Monarchy. Mello’s first idea,
like Boulanger’s last, was General Monk.

Sometimes, of course, things will not gee:
Sometimes your row is hard to hoe ;
Still, do not lie down wearily,

STEELE GREY.
One or two S.A. village settlements will
collapse very soon. There are two notable suc-
cesses, “Holder” and “Waikeri," both on the
Murray.
The Church of England and its head have
just been described by Canon Scott Holland as
“ the symbol of all that is aloof from the life of
the workers, cold to their aspirations, suspicious
of their aims, helpless in their needs, the type of
all that is privileged and propertied, and jealous
and unsympathetic, and everything the least like
Christ.” Apro/ws, there are in the square mile
known as the City of London over 60 Anglican
churches, most of them built at a time when the
merchants of London lived in the city. The
city’s resident population now is only between
50,000 and 60,000 ; and not one-half of the people
of London go to any place of worship, and there
are about as many churches belonging to other
sects and denominations. St. Magnus, near
London Bridge, is closed, but the parson, never-
theless, draws an income of .£1080; St. George’s,
Botolph-square, is closed, but the parson from
public property draws an income of .£741; St.
Mary-at-Hill is closed, but the parson draws .£500;
St. Mary Abchurch has an average congregation
of a dozen persons, the parson drawing .£740;
St. Stephen’s, Walbrook, has a congregation of
some thirteen persons, the parson drawing .£Bl5 ;
St. Andrew’s, Undershaft, has forty-five of a con-
gregation, and the parson draws <£2350; and so
on through this whole list. With congregations
averaging from a dozen to a score, we find incomes
varying from .£5OO up to over £2OOO. Probably
the congregations of these sixty city churches on
Sunday would not amount to more than 1000
persons; yet for their so-called services the
parsons receive the yearly total stipend of £62,000.
What a hideous swindle!

Scene I.—He was stone-broke, and the last few
weeks had been living on the odd drinks that he
got from the publican, in remembrance of what ho
had been. So they raised a few pounds amongst
the townspeople to pay his fare to a large mining
town.
Scene ll.— He (always a swell with a gift of
the gab) hobnobbed with the big-bugs, and they
“laid” him on to something which turned out
good. He made a pile, and spent it like a man.
Scene lII.—He is broke again, or nearly so ;
some more kind friends lay him on. He strikes it
richer than ever this time and is spending it like
water.
Scene IV.—He is standing on the steps of Scott’s
Hotel, when comes along one who had “passed
around the hat,” evidently “stiff,” “Ah, how
do you do, Mr. ?I am glad you have got on
so well. lam hard up. You couldn’t let me have
half-a-sov., could you?” He (putting hand in
pocket): “ I never lend money.” (Pulling out and
offering him a shilling.) “ Here, that will buy you
a meal and bed—good day !”
The irony of it. The poor devil who took the
“ bob ” had chipped in 20 bobs when he passed
around the hat.

THE WIDOW’S DEATHBED.
In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall rise
whose wife shall she be of them, for the seven bad her to
wife?—Mark, xii. 23.
The widow lay on her dying bed,
With candles at foot and candles at head,
And feebly turned to the priest and said :
“Father, good father, my soul to-night,
In an hour, perchance, takes its last long flight;
In an hour, perchance, I shall stand in the light
Of the great white throne, borne down with
affright—
For the weight of my sins is crushing me quite,
But deeper than this is my present care—
Deeper the depth of my dark despair,
For my greatest trouble is how I shall fare
When I meet with my various husbands there.
For each of the seven—or was it eight?—
I promised to meet at the great gold gate ;
Each as the death-mist dimmed his eye,
Each as his soul was about to fly.
With a gasping sigh that was half a cry
Said to me, ‘ Sweetest! you and I
Must part, but ’tis only to meet on high*—
Or some such conventional bathos as this ;
And then, with a lingering, ultimate kiss,
They successively started for Heavenly bliss.
But, father, the thought that oppresses my soul
Is what will occur when I reach the goal, _
And find eight cherubs in white robes wait,
My coming, at old St. Peter’s gate?
Will they in the shocked archangels’ sight
Disgrace themselves by a stand-up fight ?
And if they don’t, but agree to share
My charms, will celestial society stare
And turn up its nose? And, oh ! need I fear
The unmarried seraphim’s maidenly sneer?
And if I flirt with each and all,
Will respectable angels refuse to call ?
Will the inner circle around the throne
Begin to talk in a spiteful tone
Of fast young minxes, and purse their lips.
And gather their skirts round sanctified hips,
When we meet to drink water of life in sips ?
Will?”—here came a cough, a smothered sigh,
A moan—and the lady had gone to try.

Professor Thulixius.— Sir, —lt affords me extreme pleasure
to be able to testify to the excellence of your new Scan-
dinavian Cure, “ THULINIUS,” for severe cases of Rheu-
matic Gout. Accidentally I heard of your remedy, and on
being assured of its efficaciousness, I procured a course as a
stand-by, knowing how subject my wife was to Hereditary
Pneumatic Gout. Four days after I had occasion to administer
your wonderful preparation, and I can assure you, sir, the
effect was remarkable. From the first day my w ife improved
rapidly, and now is completely convalescent, and in justice to
you I will do all that lays in my power to publish
“THULINIUS.”—Yours Gratefully, J. A. PATTERSON, 58
Deuison-street, Woollahra. P.S.—You can use this testi-
monial with freedom.—J.A.P.
21st February, 1894.
Dear Mr. Thuunius,—On Christmas Eve, 23rd December,
1893, I had been in bed for nearly three weeks suffering from
Rheumatic Gout, when Mr. Hamburger, of 156 Rourke-street,
persuaded me to try a bottle of your Rheumatic medicine,
and its results were simply surprising. On the following
Wednesday 1 was able to sit up in a chair, and the swelling in
my legs had visibly decreased, on the following Saturday I
could get about, and on Tuesday, 2nd January, 1894, I was
able to go to my work without pain, and I rapidly improved
in health. I send you this that you may make whatever use
of it you may think best. I shall recommend it to all whom
I know.—Yourg respectfully, FRANCES DUMAS.
1 can vouch for the truth of the above.— F. Hamburger.

IMITATORS
With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heelCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,

It is commonly accepted, lately remarked
one of the most experienced of Australian ex-
plorers to The Bulletin, that primitive man, as
represented by the Australian savage, is a peerless
bushman, and can go with unerring directness to
any point. This, like the patience of the camel,
is a popular error. The blackfellow knows his
own particular country by rote, but take him to
another district and he is entirely astray. More-
over, he has no idea of either distance or direction.
If he wished to direct you to a point which, in
reality, lay due west, he would probably point
N. W.; after going a short distance on that course
he would then point S.W., then, perhaps, W.,
until he finally arrived at the spot by the parti-
cular way which he had always been accustomed
to traverse; but he would have no idea of going
straight in the first instance, This inability to
appreciate the beauty of a straight line often leads
to much misunderstanding between whites and
blacks, and has often been the means of the black-
fellow being accused of wilful misdirection,
whereas ho has been doing his best according to
his lights.
Kaffirs are flogged iu Johannesburg, South
Africa, for walking on the footpath, which is
strictly reserved for whites. It is alleged that the
mines produce a class of Kaffir snobs who jostle
white women and children at every opportunity—
hence their relegation to the middle of the road
with other “cattle.”
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin “treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
Baptist Parson E. Price holds that an
eminently applicable name for his sect is—“ The

BOKO.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
All the riding-gear is rusty, all the girths and
straps are dusty,
And the saddle’s old and mouldy where it’s
hanging on the wall;
While the stockwhip and the bridle on their pegs
are hanging idle,
And old Boko comes no longer to the sliprails
when I call.
No, because his bones are lying where I lay
beneath him dying
When the game old stockhorse blundered at the
jump, and broke his neck,
And I got a woeful smashing when the poor old
fellow, crashing
Through the timber, crushed me under to a
bruised and sightless wreck.
With his single eye to guide him very few could
live beside him
Though he was no thoroughbred, but just a poor,
old grass-fed moke,
And we held the reputation, crack-scrub dashes
on the station ;
You could track us through the raulga by the
timber that we broke.
And the day we got the buster was just after
Bangtailed muster;
I had asked the super.’s daughter to become
head-stockman’s wife;
She had answered, “I am ready. If you’ll promise
to be steady.
If you’ll give up drink and fighting, Jack, and
lead a decent life.”
And from that our quarrel started —both grew
angry and we parted,
And that night I started drinking at the shanty
on the Flat
Where the o.p. grog is snaky, and next day all
wild and shaky
I rode over to a picnic that I knew she would
be at.
She was there all mirth and gladness, but I masked
my sullen madness—
Held aloof, and would not see the sorrow grow-
ing in her eyes;
All around were gay and busy, bub my brain was
hot and dizzy,
When an old-man kangaroo went bounding past
across the rise.
Spurs and bits and stirrups jingled, shouts and
glad confusion mingled,
While we urged the dogs and horses, fresh and
eager for the fray ;
Horses, too, with plenty breeding, bub the old
bush nag was leading,
Once we left the open country Boko showed
them all the way.
Dead Box Rise and Sheoak Hollow taxed their
horsemanship to follow,
At the old marsupial fence I had them pounding
at their top;
Half-insane and wild with liquor, still I led and
urged them quicker,
Though the rest were pulling up and some were
calling out to stop.
It was only reckless flashness, only harebrained
drunken rashness,
I looked back and laughed to see them drawing
rein away behind,
Then I turned and spurred him to it, but he struck
and toppled through it;
When they dragged me from beneath him he
was dead and I was blind.
When I woke to know my blindaess, then I woke
to know her kindness,
For she stood beside my bed and bandaged up
my shattered brow,
Whisp’nng, “ Let me help to bear it. I waa
wrong and I will share it.
Won’t you have me, for I love you just as much
as ever now ?”
And she would have shared my sorrow through
this night that has no morrow,
But I loved her far too well to let her be a
cripple’s bride.
And at times when I am able just to ramble to
the stable,
Where I sib and dream of Boko and of many a
merry ride,
I can hear her children playing—l can hear the
cattle neighing—
I can hear the stockwhips cracking when the
cattle reach the yard,
But my sightless eyes may glisten—all the world
is one dark prison,
And the gates to light and gladness shall be
never more unbarred.
For the riding-gear is rusty, and the racing-tackle
musty,
And though Boko’s bones are bleaching there
are colts upon the plain,
Fiery colts just fit for breaking; but ray heart is
sadly aching,
For I know that I will never ride nor show the
way again.

Dear Bulletin,—About Queen Yicfcoriaa
When I was very young I was imbued with a
near a belief in the “divine right of kings ” as the
intelligence of the times would permit, for my
father was a Church and State man in whose
nostrils stank the very name of Dissenter. I
started out for a walking tour through Scotland,
and arrived at a Highland inn, called the “Spittle
of Glenshee,” on the same day that the Queen
wag t 0 change horses there on her way to Bal-
moral. A number of the local ladies and gentle-
men were waiting to meet her, amongst them
being the Countess of Fife (mother of the present
Duke). She was a very handsome woman, of the
Spanish type of beauty, and, seated on a big.
thoroughbred horse, looked magnificent. Watch-
ing her, a sort of hazy idea got into my head that
jf that was a countess, what must a queen be!
Up to the inn dashed the royal carriage, drawn
by four splendid grey horses. But where was the
Queen? As the carriage stopped, a dumpy, ordi-
nary-looking little woman held out her hand to
Farquharson, of Deeside, one of the crowd present,
with the salutation “Well, Jamie, howareyou ?”!!!
Away in a flash went all my dreams of royalty,
and I have never gone a step out of my way to
gee a crowned head since, although I have tra-
velled the world.-DuNCAN Macallum.
Dear Bulletin,—The average Australian
does indeed prefer the poorest imported literature
to the brightest productions of his own country,
A proof of this “ anti patriotic bias” is the fate
of that admirable work “ Halek,” written by a
Queenslander, John H. Nicholson. Though purely
the produce of the Australian bush, it is one of
the finest allegories in the language, marked, as it
is, by graceful English, picturesque description,
great dramatic power, delicate humour, and
original philosophy. It has been ten years before
the public, yet not one in a thousand has ever
read a line in it, nor, so far as I can ascertain, baa
it found its way into any of the schools of art*.
There is an author’s presentation copy in the
Johnsonian Club Library —all books by Australian
writers in that library are authors’ presentation
copies—but few of the members have opened it,
though most of them are noisy as to the unrivalled
humour of Jerome, and are absolutely deafening
as to the matchless sublimity of Marie Corelli. I
would send you the book, on the chance that you
have not read it, but it is no longer on sale in
Brisbane. 1 asked a bookseller for it the other
day—the same sapient tradesman who sent me
“ Butler’s Analogy ” when I had ordered “ But-
ler’s Hudibras”—but he had never even heard of
“ Halek,” and wanted to know if it were not
“Vathek” I was in search of.—Yours,
BOOK-
WORM.
Probably amongst Australian bushmen, no
squatter was ever held in higher estimation than
“Good old Jacky Dow,” and, excepting Jimmy
Tyson or Lauchy M'Bean, no other is the hero of
so many bush yarns. Here are one or two of them,
partially stale :—Jacky Dow was always ready to
listen to appeals for a job, but in almost every
case would express his disbelief in the genuineness
of the applicant’s desire for work, and, by way of
test, would sometimes set absurd tasks. Thus, a
swagman on one occasion, after the usual feed,
was shown a big heap of firewood and directed to
pile it up against the kitchen wall. He set to with
a will, and an hour’s hard work completed the job.
Jacky expressed his satisfaction and told his new
hand to shift the wood back where he got it from.
There was a stare of astonishment, but the boss
was all serene, so the wood was put back. When
that was done, the orders were to pile it up
against the wall again, and so Jacky kept the
game going for three or four hours, till at last
the victim put his coat on and remarked that
“this ’ere job was too bloomin’ muttonous.”
Jacky paid him and sent him away, saying
blandly; “Ah! I thought you didn’t want
work.’’ On another occasion, after the usual
colloquy, he set two men, one to sib on a gate and
the other to swing it back and forward, and to
continue at this till something else was found for
them to do. The men grinned, but took the con-
tract. After an hour or so, the division of labour
appeared to the swinger inequitable, and he made
overtures to his mate to take a turn at swinging
while he did some of the sitting, bub the mate
naturally objected, so the other, after some high
words, knocked him off the gate, and there was a
great and glorious fight. Presently, having
battered each other to their mutual satisfaction,
the two appeared before Jacky, who affected sur-
prise at their leaving their work ! but they said
they saw no points in it, so he let them go, telling
them also that “ he thought they didn’t want
work.” Another “casual” had a pannikin given
him with instructions to dip water out of the
river Murrumbidgee and to keep on doing so till
some other job turned up. The “ bushie” looked
Jacky square in the eye, and says he : “ Looky
here, Jacky Dow. They do say you’re off your
nanny, and, blow me, if I don’t believe it now.
Set a man to bale out a river ! Well, I’m !’’
But Jacky only replied, with the invariable for-
mula : “Ah ! I thought you didn’t want work.”
But (this is the stalest yarn) he met his match
for once, when he was accosted by an unmis-
takeable Yankee, who respectfully enquired if
there was “ any kind of a job hanging around ?”
—he was “ willing to turn his hand to anything,’*
and so on. Jacky, after the usual incredulous
remarks, set him to turn tha handle of the grind-
stone. The Yankee made ao sort of objection,
and Dow left him turning as if he had no other
object in life, and whistling “ Yankee Doodle.”
In about a oouple of hours Jacky came back, and
there was his new acquaintancecomfortably perched
on a board fixed in the framework of the grindstone,
reading an ancient paper and the grindstone
going at about five hundred revolutions a minute.
The son of the land of “notions” had rigged
up a rough but effective treadle, and was
working it at his ease, with his foot. Jacky took
it all in without a smile. Said he, “ Here, ray
man, you’re the very chap I want,” and thereafter
the down-easter was permanently engaged.
“ Those who sing the praises of poverty
always accompany themselves on a golden harp.”

Golem ane& Sons’Eucalypte Ex. is the strongest.
Dear Bulletin,—Would you like to know
my tramps? Well, on Monday morning a poor
old fellow, dirty and tattered, 1 walks up boldly;
“ An’, ’av ye plaze, miss ” —I’m near 40 and quite
motherly— “ Can yez give a poor man a bite to
ate? I haven’t had any since yisterday.” I give
him some bread and meat. “May the blessed
Vargin look down and bless yez and yer childer,
and may yez niver want bit or sup, and- ” Bub
I leave him—I am used to the blarney. Then, on
Wednesday, come three all together. Two come
down and ask if there is any chance of a job. I
tell them no ; I have no money to pay big wages.
“ Then, can you gi ve us something to eat ?’’ I tell
them to go and dig in the garden awhile, and I
will give them a meal; but they don’t like it, so
off they go. Thursday comes a well-dressed man
—says he can do anything; a sort of Jaok-of*all-
trades. I tell him to chop some wood and I will
give him Ins dinner, as I am a widow, and cannot
feed all travellers. He goes to the wood-pile and
picks up the axe. Chop! Then a spell. Chop!
Another spell. And soon for about a quarter of
an hour, when he sits down for a good spell.
Thinking he will work better when he is fed, I
send him his dinner and a basin of tea. He eats
what he can’t pocket, puts the rest in his bag,
picks up his swag and away he goes. One for me.
Saturday come two, with a miserable pack-horse
between them. One comes up to the house and
asks for tea and sugar. He has a wide-brimmed
hat, with two red bands round it, bell-bottomed
trousers and a watch-guard fit for a trace-chain.
But you are weary ?— Bush woman, Vie.

Old outpost of the nations, standing there
Encompassed by the stormy northern sea,
God’s ancient citadel of liberty.
His flag of freedom streaming in the air.
The Church and State have stripped thine honour

But thy polluted shores no more shall be
Earth’s golden lazarette of infamy,
For God has heard our universal prayer.
The tempest of His vengeance soon shall sweep
The apostate priesthood from His holy place,
And purge the bloody shambles of thy power.

The “Sending of the Woman.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ This must not b«, Amat!”
“ It shall be, Tuan 1”
“Thy father would not have had it so 1”
The chief took his nipa-wrapped cigar from his
mouth and flicked the ash to the ground. “That,”
said he, “is my father! This” —pointing to the
glowing end thus exposed—“ is myself! The
dead are the dead, but I live, and it shall be as I
say!”
He half turned away, then faced quickly round
again as Drake’s hand wandered, half-meohani-
oally, to his side.
“Be not a fool, white man ! Two of us might
thou shoot—or three—before thou also shouldst
be but as burnt tobacco !”
“Thou art mistaken, Amat! To what end
should I shoot now ? But I will shoot, when the
time comes, sooner than let this thing be !
“ Then, instead of but one, many will follow rny
father into the darkness. Is this the white man’s
wisdom?” And Amat went. .
“ Doesn’t look much like wisdom, either,
Drake told himself, as he looked after the hard-
headed little Dyak. “I might, as he says, pot
two or three of ’em before I’d be slashed into
ribbons, and then this infernal thing would be
carried through all the same.”

Said Mrs. Drake : “ And Amat was right!
it is white man’s wisdom ! But it isn’t white
woman's
“Oh, I see! Let s have the woman’s, then 1
and Drake, prepared to blow the cloud of consola-

“ To-morrow’evening.”

man’s swords and jars and things, and send the
lot adrift 1” . , , , . ,
Mrs. Drake covered her face, and her husband
caught something about “ the dark places of the
ea *‘ Get rid of that notion, wife !” he said. “ The
light places are just as cruel in their own way. No
varnish about the matter here —that’s all the
difference!
Mrs. Drake waived the point. “ How long will
it take the girl to drift down river ?” she asked.
“About two hours. They’ll start her on the
quarter-ebb—about four o’clock—so as to go out to
sea with the setting sun.” ....
“ Well, Jack, since you can t nip this horror in
the bud—why not get down beforehand and wait
for the poor creature ? ” .
“ Because, my dear, I’ve showed my hand—like
the ass lam ! All to-morrow I’ll be shadowed,
and, now that the old chief’s dead, some of these
fellow’s wouldn’t think twice about—well, never
mind that! ” , ...... Q .
Dorothy Drake was no mechanical pietist, bhe
knew that the Lord didn’t always interfere upon
what appeared to be the right side, and she
shivered, despite the 80-degree night air. But her
courage —like her Christianity was the real
article.
“ Would you go, Jack, if it were not for me .
“ Yes ! and within the hour ! ”
Palo little Mrs. Drake put her hands on his
shoulders :
“ Go ! ” she said.

Galun-Puli, of dubious and indefinite
memoiy, had been “almost persuaded.’ ler-
sonality—always more or less in abeyance under
savage oonditions—comes readily enough out of
its shell at the contact with more sophisticated
intelligences, and Galun, who, before Mrs. Drake
took him in hand, had been simply a Dyak of the
Dyaks no more bloodthirsty and vindictive than
the ruck, and no leas—had developed, under the
touchstone of external suggestion, the makings of a
very tolerable Christian. Tribally honest, to
begin with—he had easily enough universahsed
that idea; the hunting of heads he had trans-
ferred from the category of imperative necessities
to that of questionable indulgences; and, if the
central good-for-evil doctrine was for him but a
blank incomprehensibility, he was at any rate no
worse off than the millions of Christians who give
themselves the lie more persistently over this than
over any other of their lip-laws.
But now Galun —his instructress hoped—had
“ gone up,” and Amat, the reactionary, reigned in
his stead. Amat would have made an excellent
sectary, with the difference that, though he
utterly despised all beliefs but his own, he didn t
pretend to love the dissentients. He hated them,
and said so ! Things should be as they were
before the coming of this white woman with her
Christa —who was only the Prophet of the Malaya
over again. Amat was sick of these prophets,
who wanted a man to go the way of a woman !
and the short of the matter was that if any Dyak
wanted to run after any Prophet but him, Amat,
he would have to do so without his head !
So the defunct Galun, gorgeously arrayed, lay on
his lofty platform and awaited the “sending of the
woman,” which Amat swore should, as of old,
take place before the body could be earthed.
Beside the withered old carcase lay parang and
kris; around stood jars of rice and palm-wine,
bundles of tobacco-leaf and sirik ; and below sat,
night and day, such of the body-watchers as had
not figuratively lost their heads enough with tuak
to risk the literal loss thereof by speaking a word
or stirring from their post. But fearfully rolled
their jetty eyeballs as, just upon the break of day,
a shot flashed redly from the gloomy wall of
jungle, and, clump 1 into one of the platform-posts
plunged a rifle-bullet, aimed, not at them, but at
a lomr-haired Dyak lad that fled swiftly past them
towards the house of Amat.
“Good is the Tuan’s gun!” muttered Drake s
savage old Sooloo servant, as he stepped back into
cover. “But my eyes are as the eyes of bats!
This imp of Sheetan was a spy ; he is with Amat
by this time ! Vain is the Tuan’s journey 1”
# • •
“ In my father’s day, Tuan, these heathen
dogs of Dyaks did always thus at the death of a
chief. One boat did he find himself, outside this
very river, with swords, and jars, and silver rings,
and many precious things besides !”
“ And a woman ?” Drake asked.
“ And a woman —eya ! —young and fair to look
upon ! Her, my father sold for many dollars to a
Kini ” (Chinaman). . ,
Drake significantly tapped his pistol-pouch. 1
know thee, Hossun, and thou knowest me ! Give
heed, then, when I say this woman must be cared
for as thy sister. No Kinis, and no dollars—save
what I will give thee. And all things in the boat
shall be thine, as well !”
Hossun laughed and nodded. “It shall be so,
Tuan. The girl shall be to us as a sister, until
thou takeat her away. Paddle, ye dogs !—the sun
wears fast to the water !’’
Hossun was a coast-Malay— three-parts a pum-
pak (pirate)—but, like most of his reckless sort, a
man of his word ; and glad was he, in any case, to
do the Dyaks an ill-turn and the white man a
service at one stroke.
Like furnace-flame the surf upon the bar flared
up against the crimson sun as the boat dashed
through into the placid, palm-fringed river. Upon
the polished surface was a single speck—a quarter
of a mile above, but coming down fast with ebb
and current. It was the drifting boat, and they
paddled up to meet it.
Not a sword !—not an armlet! —neither jar nor
jewel!—no, nor robe ! The Malays invoked Alla,
the Prophet, and the Devil, but Drake didn’t hear
them—he was cutting loose the motionless figure
in the stern,
Hossun came to look. He lifted the plump,
brown arm—dropped it—raised the eyelid lis-
tened at the naked bosom —and nodded a reply to
Drake’s unspoken question,
“But, how?” the white man said. “There is
no wound !”
“ Datyorah !” said the Malay, and Drake under-
stood. Datyorah— the datura of the Hindu Thugs
—is stramonium.
Amat had been beforehand with him !

Penrith (N.S.W.) has a lady watchmaker.
At Belltree station, N.S.W., last shear g.
two shearers had an egg-eating contest for a i 25
wager. Now, the “meat” of an egg steeped in
vinegar will shrivel up to the size of an ordinary
pigeon-egg a circumstance each centestant
thought his opponent unacquainted with. When
the guzzle started, however, it turned out that
both were aware of the fact, and had prepared
their eggs accordingly. Scores ; 9 doz. and 7 eggs,
and 7 doz. and 9 ! Both lived—unfortunately.
Colemane & Sons’ Vie. Ointment is marvellous-
_ r . ,
The remarks made by the Yankees on the
N.S.W. exhibits at the greatest show on earth in
the visitors’ books provided for the purpose, have
just been noted. They are all highly flavoured,
but those on the mineral section are particularly
exhilarating. The “grands” have it, but the
adherents of “immense” have a large following,
sight - welfto'thefom‘ ojffltei Mvidull
remarked that they “beat the Dutch”; and
another person who had the patriotic spirit strong
within him committed himself to “ way up in G.”
A man whose French was a steeply-limited quality
let off “Bon-ton”as his outpouring, and another
inhabitant of the great continent, whose thoughts
turned chiefly to the political, expressed a wish
that “ South Wales be forthwith annexed.” Bv
the way, the ’Murkans could never be got to call
this country by any other name than “South
Wales.” Returned officers also report that fre-
quently the men of expectoration came in and
“wanted to see an Australian.” One youthful
member who prides himself on his English was
congratulated on having picked up the tongue so
quickly. Altogether, however, the minerals of
N.S.W. seem to have impressed the Americans as
among the best features of the Exhibition.
Serenade.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Good-night ! sweet dreams and soft repose I
Good night! bright star of angelhood !
Good-night! my garden’s one queen-rose—
Nay, who would say good-night? who would
The day’s dear memory-casket close?
Shall other days bear fruit as good ?
Alas ! who knows.
My queen ! although thy rule extend
Through day and night, through Life and Fate,
I call thee vision still, not friend,
Mine eye’s delight, not my heart’s mate,
Through many devious ways I wend ;
But find thy sweet soul’s entrance-gate
Too soon—or late.
I meet thee, kiss thee—lip to lip
And eyes on eyes, the stars behold
Our souls in seas of passion dip.
Outside, the world is dim and cold.
We two are one ! but who shall slip
The bolts of Fate, till, kindred-souled.
One crown we keep ?
On two far shores made separate,
Our spirits watch the waves that cast
Our hopes upon the rock of Fate.
We met not once in ages past,
Not once —and even so desolate
The deathless years our hives outlast.
Thou comest not, I cannot wait,
The cold stars bind the spirit fast
Until —too late !
