THE “AUBXBAIIAN
REVIEW” says:—
“The Company is very
well managed, anti tin
name is quite a house-
hold word in Sydney.
Its reputation is excel-
lent, and, although the
money-lender is gener-
ally regarded as a
vampire, the charge
cannot he laid at the
doors of the N.S.W.
Mont de Picte D. & l.
Co. Limited.”
The Safe Way to Dispose of
is by the Montgomerie-Neilson Sewage Disposal
System. This system is based upon the same
principles which relate to the circuit of the
human blood. Sewage is treated by air so
effectively that it is ABSOLUTELY INOFFEN-
SIVE AND HARMLESS. Entirely different
from the septic process, which is non-hygienic
and expensive. No putrefaction, as with the
septic process, and there is therefore no smell.
The Montgomerie-Neilson System is in-
stalled in over 600 places throughout the
State, and has been fully endorsed by leading
doctors, health inspectors and architects.
Interesting booklet contains full
information, testimonials, etc.

Weakness
Every movement of the
body uses up a definite
amount of vitality. That
is why you feel" tired at
the end of the day. When
you overtax yourself, or
when your vitality is
undermined by illness,
your whole system be-
comes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality
without assistance. Your
system is like a plant that
is drooping for want of
water. And just as water
revives a drooping plant—
so 'Wincarnis' gives new
life and new vitality to a
weakened constitution.
Because ‘Wincarnis ’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restora-
tive, a Blood-maker and
a nerve Food—all in one.
Therefore
!F>
The Wine of Life
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force,
and new vitality. The
benefit begins from the
first wineglassful. You
can feel it doing you
good. You can feel every
wineglassful giving you
more strength than you
had before, and surcharg-
ing your whole system
with new vitality. That
is why over 10.000 Doctors
recommend ‘Wincarnis.’

Fables
Why are there no Australian fables V
According to the worthy Noah Webster a
fable is “A feigned story or tale intended to
instruct or amuse; a fictitious narration
intended to enforce some useful truth or
precept.’'* The Encyclopaedia Britannica
informs me that the Arabs invented fables
as the readiest form of argument—which
suggests that the Arabs of those days were
ignorant men with no appreciation of the
value of bricks. As political arguments,
fables are not nearly so effective as catch-
phrases or plain abuse; still, they can be
employed with fairly satisfactory results. It
i 3 probable that the Chief Censor of /Esop’s
day realised this, in which case we can
guess why the eminent fabulist was executed
—as it is generally supposed he was.
The usual method of the maker of fables
who wished to deal it out to some exalted
person seems to have been to introduce his
victim, thinly disguised as (say) a frog or
a bird, into his story and then poke borak
at him. In view of the existence of the
War Precautions Act and the Unlawful
Associations Act (under which W. M.
Hughes or George Pearce, if they feel that
way inclined, can raid the Glee Club’s pre-
mises, seize the music and intern the
harmonium) Australian fabulists, if there
are any, would be well advised not to intro-
duce either Hughes or Pearce into their com-
positions disguised as a balloon or a cheese
mite.
Fables look as if they might be fairly
easy to write, but they would not bring in
much at space rates. Many of iEsop’s
best are under 200 words, and some by
Lessing and Tolstoi are even shorter. R. L.
Stevenson wrote a few, the longest about
2400 words. The shortest was this; —-
THE TADPOLE AND THE FROG.
“Be ashamed of yourself,” said the frog. “When
1 was a tadpole, I had no tail.”
“Just what I thought!” said the tadpole. “You
never were a tadpole.”
Many of the old fables, intended for juven-
ile consumption, were populated with'lions,
asses, blackbirds and golden geese, Jjut there
are modern examples, meant for sophisti-
cated adults, which are smart and slangy,
like George Ade’s “Fables in Slang,”
inhabited only by human animals. “The
Fables of George Washington AEsop” (pub-
lished many years ago by old King Cole, and
now out of print) contains some capital
samples of smart, cheeky fables, shorter on
the average than Ade’s. For instance:—
THE GOOD SAMARITAN,
certain man went from Jerusalem to Jericho,
and fell among Thieves. ,who beat him and left him
tor dead. A Good Samaritan, seeing this, clapped
bpurs to his Ass and galloped away, lest he should
be sent to the House of Detention as a Witness while
the Robbers were released on Bail.
Moral: The Perceiver is worse than the Thief.
AND :
THE AMBITIOUS ROOSTER AND THE MISSING
LYNN. *
lir A n .A m biHp"s Rooster who had pondered much
th f e subject of Evolution, went one dav to the
TTJc Pfl-h.V SC ° lf 16 Colllf J discover the Missing Lynx.
His Efforts were crowned with success; he found the
JJissing Lynx, and the Missing Lynx had Spring
Chicken an naturel for Supper. ' 1 g
Moral: Thus we sec that——
These are not bad models of their kind,
and the form is one that should appeal to
Australian writers.
Moral: It is a wise ass that knows when
to take a Hint. /

THE NEW LIGHT IN LITERATURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The London publishers, in response to an extra-
ordinary demand, are busy producing new cookery
books. All the newspapers are making a feature of
recipes for meatless dishes, and the more enterprising
dailies are vying with each other in this new depart-
ment of daily journalism. Cookery experts have
joined the staffs of the big morning and evening
papers, and are paid salaries commensurate with the
importance of their mission.”
VICTORIA.
The splendid bard has had his day.
i or long he held a regal sway
O’er studious humanity;
We read his verses by the fire.
Enthralling was his muse’s ire,
Its sweetness failed not to inspire
A suitable urbanity.
The leader-writer, man of worth,
Who still pretends to run the earth
With eloquence sophistical,
Is presently to be ignored.
Too long the reader has been bored
With his statistics, and abhorred
Presumption egotistical.
The storytellers, and the nuts
Who write about potato gluts
And vegetable particles
Will have no popular regard,
The paragrapher will be barred,
As will the other solemn card
Who writes the special articles.
Jn short, the gentle reader now
His vulgar taste will disavow
For ordinary bookery,
And give his leisure after toil
To burning up the midnight oil,
Penising Grubb on “How to Broil"*
And “Variegated Cookery.”
The eloeuter will recite
Of tarts and hash, and Melba might
Devote her great ability
1 o songs of how to boil and roast.
' hat scribe the world will honor most,
Who writes of puddings, stews and toast
With knowledge and subtility.

0. M. Mackay:—
James Edmond’s references (13/6/’18) to the
writers of Kings and Chronicles are without point, to
PVj", mildly. Armies of half a million were well
within the powers of Israel and Judah in those days.
The two kingdoms must have covered an area not far

After careful analysis “Adamax” Roofing lias proved at the hands of experts that it is the

433/4 miles of “Adamax” Roof Covering is being used
on wool-storage sheds erected in Wentworth Park by
M essrs. Stuart Bros, for the Central Wool Committee.
An order for 4400 sq. yds. was placed for use on the South Australian Wheat Board buildings.
Other big orders recently
secured by “Adamax” were:—
22,000 sq. yds. for use on the
Commonwealth Buildings
at Molongo, Canberra.

If you are sceptical about

ASPHALTUM ROOFING

and its worthiness, profit by the experience of men who have proved that
“Adamax” Roofing is Fire-resistant—that it is not affected by Gas, Chemical Fumes, Heat,
Cold, Wind and Rain. It will not Rust, Rot, Decay or Dry out—and besides giving from
12 to 14 degrees more warmth in rooms during Winter, it is equally cool in Summer.
“Adamax’’ costs One-third
the price of Galvanised-iron
and with its light weight it cuts the cost of freight dow r n to a very low figure. In every
way it is superior to Galvanised-iron— and for the man Outback it presents a perfect
insurance against roofing troubles. It is easy to lay—and even when laid perfectly flat it
is perfectly watertight, the ends being secured with a perfect roofing cement.

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect —the neglect of simple
rules of health.
OF all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-
lar fibres stiffen and every movement causes agony.
The simple habit of taking Kruschen Salts every
morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces
the nerves and gives to the user the daily enjoyment
of natural vigorous health. Get the Kruschen habit.

Oh. the hill of sleep is hard for climbing
When your heart is hot and your eyes are
wet, . „ ,
And vou long so much for its crest ot glory
There to cheat the Real with a dreamland
story,
Or at least a space forget.
The hill of sleep grows with your growing ;
•Twas just a hillock when you were small.
Where the steeds of slumber had flowers to
crop,
And you ran so fast to the very top
Without any trouble at all.
Now the hill of sleep is hard for climbing ;
White poppies die on its barren crest.
No opium wind comes downward blowing,
No fallen petals of moonlit snowing.
To hush you into rest.
When your feet are set for the higher places
Lost eyes come crying to bid you turn.
Dead loves reach after with plucking Angers,
The tune of an old song sobs, and lingers;
Old kisses brush, and burn.
Oh, the hill of sleep is hard for climbing
When your heart is hot and your eyes are

And you long so much for the crest ot glory.
There to drug your soul with a dreamland

We’ll make the sea share
A drop of water more.
Foam-white, sun-bright
Laugh the little waves — _
No one sees them in the night
Sleeping in their caves.
Sun-bright, foam-white —
Can’t you hear them call?
“Here’s a pack of bubbles light
Just about to fall!”
Brown hair, yellow hair,
Why won’t you play?
Little fishes swim and stare,
Wanting you to-day.
Yellow hair, brown hair,
They don’t forget
Pink toes that came there
Romping in the wet.

Two Worlds.
I close the book and know its world is real,
The universe that God-like Shakspeare made.
This other’s but the shadow of a shade,
Whose puppets strive reality to steal,
Yet seem but wild, unmeaning phantoms,
bred
Of some mad mind on foods exotic fed.
His sweet, green realm with love and
laughter thrilled,
With laughter and with grief, of beauty
With sound of harps, and birds that greet
the morn; , , ,
It lives, though now the vaults of space be
filled „ ~
With dreadful clamor, and fierce, bunding
light, . .
And ugly visions spewed forth by the nignt.
This hateful thing is not, but merely seems;
Like that unlovely world mad Baudelaire
On hashish fed and breathing poisoned air,
Constructed out of opium and dreams ;
This hell of smoke and flame and blood-
drenched sod , _ ~
Is but the nightmare of a troubled God .

Good Night.
All the sadness of the day
Steals away.
All the little cares and sorrows
Wait until the grey to-morrows.
Go to sleep!
All the day-frowns from your brow
Vanish now.
All the toil and all the worries.
All the slowness and the hurries,
Seem a dream. ■
Is the love that struck your heart-string
On the wing?
Hush ! Another love draws nearer
W T ho will prize and hold you dearer.
Snuggle down!
Join the love and bitter hate,
Let them mate,
And from them a laughter white
Through the starlit hours of night
Will be born.
Golden stars swing down a-croon,
And the moon
On the birth of joy and gladness.
On the doom of care and sadness,
Sets her seal.

PERDRIAU
RUBBER CONVEYOR
BELT
In connection with the Government's proposal
for the BULK HANDLING OF WHEAT, the
keynote of the whole idea is the use of a series of
Rubber Belts for the conveyance of wheat from
the trucks to the vessels loading nearby.
Mining. Industrial and Manufacturing concerns
with vast handling and transport problems to solve
are making the utmost use of Rubber Belts.
Perdriau Belts are in general use and giving
entire satisfaction throughout Australia.
Our illustration shows a section of the Rubber
Belts loading coal at Port Kembla. These belts
were manufactured by us and are said to be the
largest endless Rubber Belts in the world. They
load coal into vessels at a rate of over 600 tons per
hour.

A PROPOSED DEN OF THIEVES.
The Repudiation of thfi Australian Public
Debts was one of the subjects submitted to
the Inter-State Labor Conference which sat
recently at Perth. The Conference didn’t
turn down this proposed sneak-thievery with
unutterable contempt and expel the person
or. persons responsible as unfit to associate
with honest men or men who had sense
enough to look honest; instead it decided that
a special committee of the Federal Labor
body should ruminate over the business. _ So
a majority of these Labor representatives
regarded the turning of the party into a den
of thieves as a possibility to be seriously con-
sidered, and this suggests that the party—
unless it has incred.ble ill-luck in its choice
of agents—has got down about as low as it
is possible to get.
* * # ■*
It is not suggested that Australia is
driven to default by necessity. The interest
bill is certainly large, but it isn’t nearly so
large as the bill for foreign imported goods,
most of which we don’t really want. The
apparent need for these goods is created by
lack of enterprise and lack of energy. Labor
has been led for years by a gang which holds
that “freedom” consists in working fewer
and fewer hours; in going slow; in resisting
efficiency; in having as many strikes as pos-
sible ; and in teaching that unless the
employee lives in a constant state of nervous
exasperation with his employer he is a
“slave.” It teaches that the Australian
manufacturer is necessarily a cormorant and
an enemy because he employs white Aus-
tralian union labor at white men’s wages,
and is to be treated as such and held under
constant suspicion. And it apparently is
almost as darkly suspicious of new Public
Enterprise as of old Private Enterprise, for
after more than two years of negotiation the
very essential Public Enterprise of building
ships can hardly be said to have begun. The
small farmer, who has no employer save
himself to suspect and denounce, goes on his
industrious and poorly-paid way as of old
and is outside the range of “militant” indus-
trialism, but so far as the new movement
reaches it works against work, and aims at
the smallest amoun't of production. Mean-
while the foreign manufacturer, represented
by the blessed importer, is never denounced.
but treated with benevolent neutrality. In
a country which lends so much of its ear to
this sort of doctrine it is natural that few
things should be made while a very great
multitude are imported. About the ru.nous
bill for imported goods the I.W.W. says
nothing, for a definite policy of reducing im-
ports would involve more local production
and more of that accursed thing—honest,
profitable work.
* * * *
Bes'des, there wouldn't be the same fun
in reducing the very big bill for imports,
and being rich and honest, as in abolishing
the still comparatively modest bill for in-
terest and being ruined and discredited.
The joy of malicious breakage and chaos
would be absent. A very considerable propor-
tion of the national debt is held in Australia,
and a very great deal of it by the class
which is called “poor.” Repudiation would
mean that savings banks would have to tell
their multitude of depositors that, perhaps,
10s. out of every f of their savings had van-
ished.. Life assurance offices would regret-
fully inform the holders of some 800,000
ordinary policies, representing on the aver-
age £O2 of assets apiece, and over 750,000
industrial policies representing much smaller
amounts, also a number of annuity holders
mostly for small amounts, that the moneys
due to them would be unavoidably cut down
to 13s. in the £ or less. Joint-stock banks
and the Commonwealth Bank would reouire
to explain to their depositors and share-
holders that 3s. in the £ was gone for
certain, and that if the gang of unlettered
brigands happened to repudiate Government
notes as well as other public liabilities, then
7s. in the £ had departed. For the vast num-
ber of small shopkeepers and small employers
with small accounts this would be a shock,
and it would also be a mighty shock to their
next wages day. As for the vast
number of people who put a bit into minor
war-loan securities—practically all humble
folk, for the affluent don’t dabble much in £1
and £lO certificates—their little investments
would disappear like dried leaves blown
before a gale. There would also be a slump
in land values, for if the signature of the
Government on a debenture was no good
there would be a dreadful suspicion that its
value on a Torrens title would* presently
prove just the same, so there would be a
further crumbling in the value of Savings
Bank deposits, life assurance policies, build-
ing- society securities and the like. All this
riot among the savings of rich and poor
alike isn’t suggested, because what are com-
monly called the really poor are heavily
taxed. They are exempt from income-tax,
probate duty, succession duty, most of the
stamp duties, for they don't dabble much in
stocks and shares and land deals, war profits
tax, land-tax, absentee land-tax, local rates,
these being wholly chargeable on property,
and the proposed levy on wealth; likewise
license fees of most kinds, and most of the
Customs duties, for these fall chiefly on
luxuries. In fact, they are exempt from
almost everything, and they are entitled to
old age and invalid pens'ons, which are
moderate enough in all consciences but which
constitute a world’s record for liberality all
the same.
The Repudiation idea, of course, depends
on the child-like belief that a law passed by
an Australian Parliament can do anything.
Unfortunately it can’t do quite anything.
Australian securities are held very largely
in Britain, and they have also drifted by
purchase to other countr'es. Supposing Aus-
tralia repudiated its debts, as proposed by
a considerable section of the men who are
permitted to represent Labor, not because
Australia couldn’t pay, but because it
wouldn't pay, then things might hap-
pen. Not only Br'tain but one or
two other Great Powers might, so
soon as they had a spare moment on their
hands, serve on us short notice to settle uo
with compound interest, cost of col'ection
and a humble apology. There would then be
just three alternatives—to do a pitiable
climb down, to submit to the indignity of
having receivers put into our tax-collecting
departments at our expense with armed
guards maintained at our expense, or to fight
a good part of the world in a bad cause aud
pay a big indemnity in the end. Nothing
would be gained by exp’aining that our
doings were strictly in order by Australian
Parliamentary enactment. The strong and
aggravated outsider would simply reply that
he wasn’t an Australian subject, and that his
country was in no way bound by our enact-
ments. At a rough estimate there wou’d be
four debits and two credits when the account
was made up. On the debit s’de there would
be (1) an unparalleled breakage and stop-
page of industry and wages. There would
almost certainly be 12) a big civil commo-
tion, for there is a limit to the patmnee of
the communLy, and the enraged and
defrauded holders of 1.550.000 life policies,
to say nothing of other losers, would be more
than enough to lay the whole Labor caucus
in a flat position and soank it. There would
be (3) the ridicule of the world, the apology,
the paying up with costs and the j b and
expense of repairing the damage. And there
would be 14) the d’siHusionment, for if it
were poss'ble (which it surely isn’t) that
such respected men as Frank Tudor or
Thomas Joseph Ryan should throw in their
lot with the liepudationist party no one could
ever invite them or their families to his house
again without counting the spoons and lock-
ing up the jewellery, for it is impossible for
a man to keep his public and his private
character ouite apart in popular estimation.
These are the principal debits. On th<> cred't
side there would be a valuable awakening,
and the pleasure of deporting a lot of un-
desirable pro-Hun characters on a life
sentence.
THE TAPE AND SEALING-WAN
DEPARTMENT.
Veky reasonably the public servants of the
Ma State complain of the rule-of-thumb
economy which has stopped increments on
salaries above £325 per annum. This is alleged
to be, in some vague fashion, “by reason of
the war,” which is plain ridiculous, The
war-bill doesn’t come out of the State
Treasury. The point is that the Govern-
ments which Holman has figured in. with
their drivelling capacity for spending
2s. 6d. where only e.ghteenpenee was
spent before, and getting a shilling’s-
worth of results, ran un the State
expenditure from £14,000,000 to £2O 000,000
and had little to show for the increase save
some odds and ends, a few fragments of
cheap popularity, a certain amount of con-
tumely, a lot of new jobs and a great deal
of incapacity. They ate money; they
drank money; they threw money out of
windows; they left money in all manner of
places and cou’dn’t remember what had hap-
pened to it. Now the stoppage of the regu-
lar salary increases to a very moderately-
paid class is a handy device for effecting a
sort of economy. It is the easy sort of thing
that anybody could do in his sleep; while re-
organisation requires wakefulness and brains.
The fact is that the not-over-paid service is
too large. There should be fewer salaries;
not lower salaries. It is not that the men
do less work than they should, but that the
ramshackle system makes needless work to
do. Anybody can make work—really hard
work, which isn’t worth do : ng. The white
elephant of Siam is proverbial. Its white-
ness is allegedly caused by a beastly skin
disease. It is sacred because it is white. It
is expensive because it is sacred. The
superfluous animal must, belong to the
superfluous king and to no other, because its
sacredness makes it too important to belong
to anybody else. A large and very hard-
worked Civil Service is required to look after
the herd of creatures which only wanted to
be let alone, and a revenue shortage is liable
to ensue at any moment. N. S. Wales is great
ou white elephants. It requires three times
as many lrighly-paid Comnrssioners to super-
vise its civil service as Victoria does, and
it takes 87 people in all to tell the plain
public toiler that his increase of salary won’t
happen. The growth of that ever-growing
institution at the top is an indication of the
growth of thin vs underneath. Here are sug-
gestions for civil service reform :
(1) Find out how much needless work is being
done; how many Commissioners are sitting in a
row when one Commissioner sitting in a row would
suffice; how many, people are initialling other
people’s papers;'how many imaginary things are
being attended to; how many gentlemen are looking
through the same telescope and not finding the same
old unsaleable comet; how many are compiling
records that don’t fetch their cost—inquiring into
things to-day that are forgotten to-morrow or <jeven
yesterday.
(2) Find out how the needful work can he done
with less circumlocution.
(3) Get rid of all the men who can be spared, but
do it with fair compensation. If a mah is doing use-
less work for £ 400 a year it is better to pension
him off with £l5O or £2OO a year, if he is entitled
to that and there is absolutely no useful work for
him to do, than to keep him on digging the old
hole and fdling it up again.
(4) Allow no new department to be created, not
even a beautiful Board of Trade, unless by the vote
of both Houses of Parliament after presentation of
full particulars.
(5) Prohibit the appointment of anv politician to
a paid billet except as Speaker or Chairman of Com-
mittees until he has been five years out of Parlia-
ment. By that time bis “pull” will probably have
evaporated, and there will be no need to find a billet
for him.
(6) Above all, begin at the top. If one Commis-
sioner and twelve understrappers can appoint as
many public servants as the State can afford, why
have three old gentlemen as Commissioners and 34
understrappers ?
On _ some such lines as these, with such
additions ard improvements as might occur
t-> a Premier as little like Holman as pos-
sible, it might perhaps not be necessary to
steal or confiscate any of the salary to which
the really useful public official is entitled.
Stopping the rise that is due to a civil ser-
vant next year isn’t exactly the same as
stopping the interest due to a bondholder
next year; still, there is a resemblance.
BETWEEN THE SECONDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Aston' Sassin leaned forward a little, spat
disgustedly between his mud-encrusted boots,
and cursed the few remnants of self-respect
which still survived to occasionally torment
him. The man immediately in front of him
stirred uneasily as he stood and attempted to
look backward over his shoulder. So closely
were the waitingmen packed in the communica-
tion trench that the least forward or backward
movement disturbed the whole line, travel-
ling along in a blasphemous undulation. The
expectorating of the one and the avoidance
of the. other were transmitted for several
yards in both directions in a series of irri-
table jerkings. The passage echoed with the
hoarse and irregular breathing of the human
serpent, _ and the atmosphere was almost
viscid with the stench of a mighty and un-
ceasing perspiration. The yellow sides of
the trench glistened with moisture as though
they were sweating sympathy. The floor
was carpeted with slime. Overhead, beyond
the thin roofing of mud-plastered boards, the
air was ripped and lashed as if an army of
giants was scourging the. sky. The earth
seemed to shake with fear as it felt the
agony of the tortured air. and the whoosh
or the whirling thongs filled the few untried
men with tremblings.
Sassin commenced to yawn, and won-
dered languidly how many of his company
would return. After a while he discovered
that by leaning his head a little to the left
he could just see the right arm, shoulder and
profile of the lieutenant who was standing
in the open trench some ten yards ahead.
The officer’s arm was bent upwards with the
whistle shiring between his fingers in readi-
ness, and his pose was one of alert intent-
ness. Sassin stared along the space be-
tween the heads in front until his neck
ached; but that figure of repressed virility
with its significant whistle seemed to en-
chain his soul. By degrees the fascination
began to change into a feeling of impatience,
and after a time the watcher suffered from
an almost ovenvhelming desire to shout
aloud and startle the frozen figure into
action. Then, with a suddenness that was
like a twinsre of nhysical pain to the watch-
ing man. the officer thrust the whistle be-
tween his lips.
Havinsr the accumulated memories of sev-
eral similar attacks Sassin had expected a
certain amount of frenzied jostling before
reaching the comparative freedom beyond
the parapet. When he discovered that he
was scrambling down over the outer bank
without any coherent recollection of having
moved out of the communication trench he
was vaguely irritated; for he was
an observant and self-centred man. and
such a break in the chain of his experiences
was unusual. So piqued was his passion
for detailed record by that unaccountable
lapse that he would have made almost any
sacrifice to have returned to his former posi-
tion and started again. He suddenly remem-
bered his diary. Now the diary of Sassin
was a work of art —the art of morbid intro-
spection. More than that. It was nearer
the real Sassin than Sassin himself. It
was no mere cynical gymnasium wherein an
imaginative spirit might disport itself for
its amusement. Its compilation was as
sacred a duty to Sassin as his belief in Got),
and its claims upon the author were unceas
iug
Sassin was suddenly startled by the collapse
of the man who was running in front of him.
The prostrate figure splayed out its limbs
and contorted grotesquely. Sassin observed
the man calmly and swerved to avoid him ;
but for some reason his legs seemed to be
uncontrollable. He stepped on to the centre
of the heaving back. The wounded man
quivered beneath the pressure and turned
over, glaring upwards at Sassin with a
murderous stare. As Sassin ran onwards
he became more and more mystified by the
memory of that ferocious look. Had lie
not attempted to avoid him? To Hell with
these touchy animals! He almost choked
with indignation.
Two hundred yards away the German
parapet was alive with grim, waiting fig-
ures, and the crackling gusts of rifle-fire
seemed to perforate his ear-drums. The air
was full of a peculiar swishing noise, and
six times during as many paces he felt the
air-ripples of flying lead flurrying past his
face. All at once something in front of him
humped itself upwards into a mighty mush-
room on a stalk of fire. The ground shud-
dered and an invisible wave of displaced air
smashed against him, almost bursting his
lungs. He heard the venomous wheep of
hurtling splinters and then the descending
debris came out of the drifting cloud in a
filthy shower. He remained rigid. After a
paroxysm of coughing, he commenced to
claw the mud off his breast and shoulders.
He could have screamed with rage, so power-
ful was his sense of humiliation. In the
midst of his contortions he realised that the
arrival of the barrage would be a matter of
seconds.
For a moment the sodden earth seemed
to stiffen as though taking in a breath. The
sky thrilled 'in anticipation. From the
zenith came a vague droning that expanded
into a vile, whooping scream. Out of the
earth for Mildreds of yards to his right and
left there sprouted fungi of death. The
so'l bubbled to its roots. The vista changed
to a forest of flaming growths which swayed
in the thickening air. Then Sasstn longed
for deafness as he had never longed before,
for the whole world was being annihilated
by Sound—a sound that was the inexpress-
ible made ap'dible. It swelled iD a crescendo
until it became a monstrous palpitation
which boomOd find surged as though the
heart of. this planet was about to burst
through its tormented flesh. For one de-
b'r'ous instant Sassin saw the Invisible.
Then, out of his mental tumult came the.
thought that something was lying crouching
behind those towering fungi. He knelt
down cautiously and shivered as he looked;
for that which be awaited had the tremors
of a fiend. His eyes followed the move-
ments of those blazing stalks as a hunter
watches the swaying grasses. A face peered
out from between two of the fiery sproutings.
The mouth quivered for a moment, and he
could see a. glistening body that seemed to
be alive protruding from between its black-
ened Vps. Then the horror snat forth ,an
appalling whistling screech, and the note of
defiance in the sound seemed to set the
watcher’s brain afire. Into his subconscious-
ness issued a voice, the voice of Panton.
his comrade, and its message was a goad to
the hesitating man. “Go on!” it com-
manded. “What in Hell is wrong with
you?” Sassin got up from his knees and
plunged forward with a yell of rage towards
the fungi. All at once something sprouted
from beneath his feet and reared itself sky-
ward. Then darkness.
Sassin awakened into a world of white-
washed walls and crumbling plaster, a world
that reeked with carbolic. He stared aggres-

HAROLD LINDSAY.
TRICKS OF THE HUN TRADE.
Possibly the Hun, now that he has reaped
all the profit and can’t hope to do the trick
a second time, would burst if he hid the story
any longer, or possibly the facts leak out by
themselves like the dead body which refuses
to stay cemented under the hearthstone.
When these two amazing frauds with the
false names, Lenin and Trotsky, were start-
ing the era of peace and brotherhood in
Russia, and the old order was passing, and
the new order was untidy and partially in-
toxicated, the morale of the illiterate army
began to tlicker out. It didn’t know where it
was. Then the Hun soldiery proceeded to
fraternise, according to strict instruct'ons
which have since been published. Soldiers,
specially selected for knowledge of Russian
speech, were sent to the extreme front.
Michael started at a certain hour to speak
gently to Ivan in the opposite trench. He
wasn’t to shout lest he should put Ivan off
his feed, but to speak in a tone set down in
the regulations. He was to smile at Ivan
with a smile specified in the regulations—its
length, breadth and duration ; also to nod his
head as per diagram. The things he was to
say to Ivan were taught him in full—about


the Hull’s weariness of the war, the wide-
spread rising of the Hun people against their
oppressors, the fact that the Hun had already
decided to throw down his gun and go home,
and his desire that Ivan should do the same,
because Michael couldn’t well leave for
home and mother if Ivan was likely to bom-
bard him in the back. MICHAEL gave tobacco
to Ivan, special officers serving out the
tobacco for the purpose before Michael
began beaming and nodding. Michael sup-
plied Ivan with Russian papers printed
specially in Germany, telling how peace was
actually being signed and everybody was
going home, the Kaiser included. He handed
oyer food and drink which he badly wanted
himself. He began to drift into his brother’s
trenches, where he was generous and eloquent,
and meanwhile Huns carefully concealed were
ready to shoot the brother if he detained
Any papers that Ivan gave in
return for all this kindness Michael was
strictly ordered not to read. They had to be
handed over to the proper officer. At a fixed
hour the plausible Hun packed up his
benevolent expression, put on his old wooden
aspect, reported progress to the proper
officer, handed over all information, accounted
for the tobacco and the papers, and his place
was filled by the next philanthropist. Along
hundreds of miles of line there was a dis-
organised army receiving no definite orders,
ceasing to heed its officers or chasing them off
the premises, feeding on Hun-made literature,
and smiling at large. Also there was the
outer fringe of another army, professing dis-
organisation but under boiler-metal disci-
pline and sritiling with the precision of the
goose-step. The end was that both parties
left for home; that is to say. that Ivan
started for his own home after selling his gun
to Michael, and Michael started for Ivan’s
home carrying two guns. The business seems
crude, but when an ignorant peasant soldier
finds himself embraced by 50,000 srncere
friends all at once, it is hard for him to
believe that they are all hypocrites. They
are so dashed numerous. Even a banker may
be dazed if 50,000 forged cheques are pre-
sented at once.
THE CLOVEN HOOFS OF JACOB.
“Solomon Malaprop” speaks:—
Every day, when there is a spare moment lying
around, the Labor party, or at least those whom it
appoints to speak for it and for whom it is responsi-
ble, devotes it to urging the public to let the Hun
down easily. He is not to be crippled and put out of
action as he would have done by us if the chance had
come his way. He is to be left as far as possible
undamaged so that he may be in the best condition
to renew the attack and commit, the tragedy over
again. Assuming, which seems reasonable, that the
forces of the Hun-Junker alliance and the alliance
that we belong to were about equal at the start, and
that the losses in battle are about equal, the parties
are to be left equal, so that the enemy who so nearly
won this time will only require a sfiade better luck to
win next time. This, of course, is} taking no account
of the fact that all the hideous lotses of civil popula-
tion by murder, mutilation, enslavement and torture
will be on our side, because it is bur Allies’ territory
which has been occupied and devastated—r.ot Hun
territory. Yet this is a very big} item. In Servia,
Montenegro, Belgium, Poland, northern France and
northern Italy the men who dPrtle of full working
and defence age between, say, 193 H and 1934 will be
unusually few’, because the Hu*s killed so many
prospective mothers or rendered them incapable of
motherhood, and slew so many children, and starved
or tortured so many youths thtit.' they necessarily
grew up weak and stunted. Thcite will be a time of
terrible weakness for defence purposes in the occupied
countries as the present young generation becomes
due to take over the job of its fathers, and that will
be a good time for the new Hun attack unless some-
thing is done to greatly reduce the Hun power in
advance.
And wild horses wouldn't draw from the Aus-
tralian Labor representatives an allusion, or the
trace of an allusion, to this material aspect of the
case. With the astuteness of a police-court, lawyer
and the plausible one-sidedness of a Hun diplomatist
the Perth Inter-State Labor Conference has again
stated its case in these words: —
Further participation in recruiting shall be subject
to the following conditions:
That a clear and authoritative statement be made
on behalf of the Allies asserting their readiness to
enter into peace negotiations on the basis : t>f no
annexations and no penal indemnities.
There is a semi-plausible clause in another part' of the
argument about “liberty and democracy and the in-
dependence of small nations,” which might perhaps
give Poland a chance of resurrection. To that extent,
and in a feeble, shadowy, non-cpmmittal way, the
utter shamelessness and the foul treachery and the
black disgrace of that “no annexations” clause is.
modified. But according to the clause Alsace-
Lorraine must be left under the grinding tyranny of
the Hun militarists because that double-barrelled pro-
vince isn’t and has never been a nation, save in the
doubtful sense that Lorraine was for a short time in
the very long ago a semi-independent dukedom.
Alsace-Lorraine wants, above all things, to recover
its old status as a part of France. The only German
feeling in the place is that of some German settlers
who took the places of the people with French sym-
pathies that have been harried out since the Huns
stole the country in 1871. The real native sentiment
is overwhelmingly for annexation —to France.
The Servian parts of Austria want annexation to
Servia. They are not “small nations” to be made
independent; but parts of the old Serb empire and
nation which want to get home again. Bosnia,
Herzegovina and the other Serb provinces of Austria
must remain Austrian under this proviso.
The Italian provinces which have suffered the
grinding tyranny of Austria for ages are doubly dis-
qualified ih the same cunning way. They are not
“small nations” entitled to separate treatment, but
merely odd bits. And they can’t be annexed to
Italy, where they belong and where they want to
belong, if Australian Labor, in conference at Perth,
is allowed to say No. They must also remain with
the Hun.
Macedonia isn’t a “small nation.” It hasn’t been
a nation since the time of Perseus, the comely king
who was more of a fashion-plate or clothes-horse
than a statesman, and he struck his finish more than
2000 years ago. So this land of mixed peoples
must go back to the unspeakable Turk by the
“no-annexation” rule. It is the same with
Palestine, Syria and that vague country without
boundaries which we call “Mesopotamia.” They
are, like Egypt, which isn’t a nation either nowadavs,
lands Of mixed peoples, too mixed to make Parlia-
mentary Government probable or even possible, sup-
posing they knew what it meant. Their only chance
at present is annexation or protection or whatever
it may be called by some fatherly race quite unlike
the Hun or the Turk. The temporary French occu-
pation of Syria is an old story now, yet old people
still talk of a possible good time “when the French
will come back.” The Perth Labor Conference hands
them to the Turk quite cheerfully, and says the
good time must not come back.
The people who speak for Labor seem to
have got beyond the point at which they
care a damn for the oppressed Little Peoples,
except as an afterthought or a parent lesis.
They seem to be approaching the point at which
every Australian who is hostile to the Hun will be
an enemy. The hands are the hands of Esau (\\ io
was hairy, yet a gentleman), but the cloven hoofs
and the horns and the tail and the breath especi-
ally the breath- are the appurtenances of Jacob
(who was smooth and devious and unreliable just
b 'l<o Bkthmann-Holweg).
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Great War of 1932-1938.
There is something uncanny about the way
the Hun looks forward. It is especially un-
canny when one remembers that between the
end of Frederick the Great and the beg n-
ning of Bismarck he was an ordinary,
slummocky person—tyrannised over and liv-
ing by rule and line under the all-pervad.ng
eye of the bureaucracy, but quite unable to
provide himself with a bureaucracy that was
a whit less stupid than the average political
machine. Bismarck inVented the art of
illimitable and well-directed energy, of illimit-
able patience, and of looking 40 years ahead.
Everyone knows that a very big war inter-
rupts the birth-rate, because possible fathers
are away from the possible mothers, or are
disabled or buried. It interrupts the birth-
rate in the country that does the invading
and far more in the country that is invaded.
Then about 18 years later a fearful weakness
develops in an unexpected place. The crop
of babies of the war year should be showing
as a generation of workers and fighters, and
that crop is missing or very short. If the
present war ends in 1921) there is liable to
be a grievous lack of new man-power
over Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy,
Britain and, above all, Belgium, Serbia
and Romnania in the years from 1932
until 1938. There will of conrse be a
breakdown before then through the fear-
ful loss of adult males, but the extra
slump through the number of unborn baby
males will begin to show itself about 1932.
The Hun looks forward. He proposes that
Germany will be the one country which won't
slump in 1932. so that it will be strong just
when its rivals are excessively weak. So
the birth of illegit mate children is encour-
aged in every possible way, and po’ygamy is
fostered, and the illegitimates are recognised,
not only as being the equals of children born
in wedlock, but as something almost superior
—special evidences of patriotism. Thus
the scanty suppK of p iss.ble husbands is
expected to go round. The Allies don’t feel
sufficiently low and animal to take the same
precautions; still if they have sufficient sense
also to keep an eye on 1932 there are things
they can do after they have brought the Hun
to peace. Recognising that he will probably
disarm only to arm again in secret, they
can prohibit the export of food to Germany
and Austria, so that these countries wll
have to feed their own prospective armies.
They are both far more than capable of feeding
themselves if they don’t occupy too many men
with military training and munition work,
so there will be no real hardship. And the
big All ; ed countries can refuse to take manu-
factured goods from Hun-land except under
a heavy and very spec'al anti-Hun tariff.
Likewise, they can shut out all Hun immi-
grants and visitors on the ground that they
have enough enemies in the'r midst already.
These do'ngs don’t necessarily show a sp rit
of revenge. They will only mean that the
big Allies, recognising that the far-seeing
Hun is already ahead of them in his prepara-
tions for the war of 1932-1935, are making
their own belated preparations—not offensive
l'ke those of the Hun, but purely defensive.
If the .big and fairly decent nations had
begun to look forward intelligently after
1871, there need have been no 1914. If they
begin to look forward intelligently about
1920 there need be no 1932. Otherwise
there may be a 1952, and it may be a worse
Sheol than the present period.
A Broad-minded Ministry.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes:—
When the N. S. Wales politicians were greasing one
another on the fifth anniversary of Premier Hol-
man’s profitable job, it was alleged by Fuller, who
ran Holman’s job for a spell, that his boss was
the “most broad-minded statesman in Australia.’’
In a sense he is. Look at the hroad-minded money
aspect of the case:—•

Holman's Predecessors Goino.
1896 .. £9,270,038 1903 ..£13,960,76.3
1899 .. 9,754,185 1909 .. 13,646,126
1902 .. 11.178,214 1910 .. 14,540,073
1905 . . 11,514,324
Average increase, £376,427 per year.
N.S.W. Revenue Required to Keep the' McGowen-
Holman Government Going (McGowen Premier
and Treasurer.)
1911 ..£13,839.139 I 1913 ..£16,057,298
1912 .. 15,776,816 |
Average increase, £505,742 per year.
N.S.W. Revenue Required to Keep the Holman
Government Going (Holman Premier and
Treasurer.)
1914 ..£18,298,625 1917 ..£20,495,996
1915 .. 18,923,551 1918 .. 21,684,125
1916 . . 19,629,442
Average increase, £1,125,365 per year.
In addition the Holman Government has spent
more than its big revenues, for it has piled up a
deficit of £459,313. And on top of all there has
been the biggest expenditure of loan money on record,
ft has taken a vast piling up of new taxes to keep
the Broad-minded Ministry on its unwise feet.
Of course Holman, like all other Treasurers, has
been assisted by the great increase in currency.
The amount of money a Government can collect
from the country depends largely on the amount of
good money—money that is worth nominal value—
there is in the country. Since Holman became
Premier almost exactly £30,000,000 has been added
to the paper currency—that is to say, the paper
issue less the gold reserve (the uncovered paper)
has increased to that extent. On a popvdation basis
it may he assumed that about £11,500,000 of this
increase is in N. S. Wales. It is money which can’t
escape from the country, no matter how m :ch we
owe abroad for imported goods 'or interest on foreign
debts, for it is no more value outside the country
and away from its coin reserve than its weight
in paper-mill material. So it is available to be
collected to-day and spent to-morrow and gathered
in again next day, and so on ad infinitum. Nor
can it be said that it has depreciated yet, though it
certainly will do so if the amount of paper currency
is increased beyond the requirements of the com-
munity. Thus the Treasurers are on a good artificial
wicket. In fact, by reason of State land-sale booms,
private land booms, gold-mining booms, foreign loan
booms, and row the paper-money boom, there has
been, since 1851, some kind of an artificial
wicket for a Treasurer to bat on. The trouble is
that, all the timber and all the woodenness ir Aus-
tralia don’t seem to make a wicket big enough for
the Ma States Broad-minded Cabinet. The name is
worth remembering. Britain once had a Broad-
bottomed Ministry, so-called because almost every-
body who wanted a job and a salary seemed to get
in on the ground-floor.
The Double-barrelled Spending System.
There are not many men who strike momen-
tous truths with greater emphasis than Pre-
mier Holman. In the midst of a crisis
recently he heavily banged his desk
and challenged the universe to deny
that the following day would be Satur-
day. And when no one attempted to
contradict him the young man left a few
more red herrings on the floor and
departed. It is a great accomplish-
ment. Last week, feeling that some-
thing had to be said in defence of duplication
of taxation, Holman unloaded a speech to
sustain the theory that “the change in the
position of the taxpayer is due not to the
number of Governments but to the com-
mencement of the war.” Having shown that
if there had been no war there would have
been no war expenditure, he clinched the
argument with a passionate declarat'on that
“abolition of State Governments will not end
the war nor diminish taxation.” Further-
more he refused to believe that war could be
carried on without taxation, or thg.t the fact
of war involving taxation was a reason for
ending it. This is fairly correct. No one
has ever said that the war could be won by
blotting out a State Government. No one
asked the country to believe what Holman
declines to imagine. Nor has anybody
asserted that if the war had not been raging
the States would have borrowed £250,000,000
for the maintenance of peace and contracted
vast liabilities for pensions. What Holman
has to face is the question of whether it is
expedient or even reasonably sane in view of
the inescapable fact that there is a war and
a war debt of gigantic magnitude for Aus-
tralian citizens to cl ng to a system under
which debts can he piled up by Seven Parlia-
ments, independently of each other, and that
taxes can belevicd on the citizens of each State
by two Governments. What Australia has to
deal with are the truths of the moment, not
with the nebulosities of what might have
been. The facts to consider are: (1) That
there is an immense debt on the shoulders of
the people, (2) that taxation to meet the
charges incidental to that debt is increasing
rapidly, (3) that taxation for other pur-
poses, State and Federal, is quickly moving
upwards. Now, does it make for financial
stability, or does it give the taxpayer a
reasonably fair deal to have Seven Parlia-
ments taxing the national earnings and
pawning the national assets? Or would it
be more prudent to put the responsibility to
the electors into the hands of a single author-
ity ? _ Holman’s yearning to continue seeing
two income-tax schedules in circulat ; on and
at the same time borrowing to defray the
cost of Cocked Hats and other unreproduc-
tive luxuries nr’ght have been understandable
at. one time. But it looks a b’t queer to-day.
And it will look still more quaint later on.
“Tons” and Sundries.
Wool-tops are not a poetic or inspiriting
subject, but seeing that one big factory em-
ploys 700 white Australians at Botany
(N.S.W.) they are important in th ; s land
where manufacturers are few. The making of
tops is a preliminary process in wcollen manu-
facture, and an important one. A specially
blessed feature about the industry is that it
makes much of its profit, not out of Aus-
tralians, but out of people in other countries.
Therein it differs from the importer’s job.
for the importer makes all his profits out of
us. Thanks to the slumberous tariff and the
wakeful importer, there are comparatively
few woollen factories here to create a de-
mand for tops, but there is a market in
Britain and Japan. Most other countries
adjust their tariff so that they buy raw
wool only. The Japanese market will probably
close or partly close as soon as the man of
Nippon has time to adjust his tariff, for he
isn t a f reetrader by habit. The British
muiket may last, for the Briton is a Free-
trader by habit. So it is to some extent a
precarious but profitable—-highly
profitable. Since the war the production
and sale of wool-tops have been con-
trolled by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, and 50 p.c. of the net earnings has been
taken by the Central Wool Committee;
so this industry, which makes most of- its
money out of other people and spends its
money here, is on a worse wicket than (so
far as we are concerned) are many concerns
which make all their money out of us and
spend most of their takings among sharehold-
ers elsewhere. The Colonial Combing, Spin-
ning and Weaving Co., which is the principal
concern around which the row centres, has,
of course, other taxes to pay out of the 50
per cent, wh.ch the Commonwealth doesn't
take. Even then it is apparently doing well,
and there is such a wild novelty about an
Australian manufacturing industry doing
well while br.nging other people’s money
into the country that one is inclined to
applaud. The affair was started with the
help of a Government bonus, and bonuses
are common enough, and it repaid the ad-
vance, which isn’t so common. It is a fact
that the co. is almost a one-man affair, and
lor all we know to the contrary many of
the importing companies with head offices
m England may be just the same. Companies
that are practically ong-man affairs are fre-
quent. Anyhow the Commonwealth Govern-
ment proposes that the industry should be
semi-nationalised; that the shareholders
should get not more than 12 J per cent, on
‘heir money if they earn it, and that the
community should take the balance. The co.
says in reply that it is not only an Aus-
tralian industry itself, employing Australian
labor at Australian wages, but that it is
busy starting other AustraUhn industries to
make its own plant and machinery, thereby
nil ng a want in a misguided, importer-
ridden land, and that it will find as little
joy in using its brains and energy on this
kind of woik when there can be no extra
gain in it as it would in buying a Tatter-
Sall’s ticket if the Commonwealth took
Per cent, of the big prizes. The man
woo gambles on a large scale in mines or
factories or anything else has good specs,
and bad ones. If he is a brilliant speculator
he becomes very rich ; if he is a dull one he
ends in humble circumstances. What he
says is that no strenuous politicians ever
want to nationalise his bad specs, or to
nationalise the whole lot together; and that
there is no inducement to gamble unless
there is a chance of a rich pr'ze at the end
not necessarily a job as Prime Minister
or High Commissioner or Figurehead of a
Board of Trade, but some kind of a prize.
Anyhow, if a doubt can be found an Aus-
tralian institution shou’d have the benefit
. ,f —especially one which loots the Egyp-
tians.
Number 4 of the conditions of peace, which
the Perth Labor Conference, alleged to be
representing all Australia, proposes to inflict
by process of “nesrotiation” :
That prior to the disbandment of combatant armies
and merchant navies employed in the war, they shal)
be utilised by an oi-?ani3ed system .of volunteer ser-
vice for restoring the devastated territories- at the
expense of the invading Powers, which shall also
compensate the widows and denendants of all non-
combatants, including seamen who have lost their
lives as a result of hostilities.
Analysed, this crazy proposal means to Aus-
tralia that her soldiers and sailors are to be
invited not to come home after the war is
finished, but to volunteer to build houses,
plough fields, plant orchards, feed pigs, shear
sheep and generally undo the work of the
unspeakable Hun. They are to be paid by
the Ilun. presumably, in his debased cur-
I ns ‘ e ad of the Billjims, the Macpats,
tne Cockneys, the Gourkas and the S’Afri-
cans getting back to their own homes and
attending to much-negleeted work, the Aus-
tralian Labor party proposes that they shall
remain in Europe cleaning up the mess that
the Hun and his rotten allies have made.
I hey are to be wage slaves to the Hun. The
Ilun is also asked to pay compensation to
the hundreds of thousands of civilians and
their denendants of those who harm lost their
lives. This is the statesmanship of the one-
time powerful Australian Labor party! The
sreat blond beast is hound to rush into a
‘peace by negotiation” on these terms. Is
there yet some room left in the lunatic
asylums of fir's country?
The decision of a number of trades unions
to go out of miscellaneous politics in their
union capacity has been inevitable for some
time past. It is good enough for their mem-
bers to belong to any political body they
choose, or any church they choose, or any
literary or artistic cult that appeals to them *
but the mixing of things leads to exaspera-
Goib. Trades unionism is a necessity of our
civilisation; it may become effete, but that
will be under a different civilisation. A
miner (say) naturally belongs to the union
of his craft. But when he attends a meeting
to deal with matters essential to his interests
as a nrner he doesn’t always want to listen
to shoutings of which he may totallv dis-
approve, from people regarding whose intelli-
gence he may have a very low opinion, about
war or the public debt or the condition of
Ireland or the alleged growth of big estates.
Then he may be called upon to pay for the
upkeep of a “Labor” paper which devotes
much of its space to denunciations of
Defence, to holding out the olive branch to
the unspeakable Hun, to schemes for pawn-
ing Posterity even more deeply to the foreign
cnpital'st, and such-like devices. Compulsory
anti-conscription and compulsory newspaper
subscription are examples of the many things
that have been tacked on to Trades Umonism
by limelighters and self-advertisers who are
in search of compulsory followers for their
own advancement.

The Spell-oh at Armageddon.
The German seems to have been keeping
ominously quiet lately. Last week he was
not even heard from. One result appears
to have been that Riix'JlM reckoned the
time was ripe to go over and tickle him up
again. Wherefore just before dawn the
other day was a hot time in the vicinity
of Hamel, which is over beyond Amiens.
The Australians thereabouts, linking up
with the available Americans, rushed for-
ward along a wide front and. besides
severely mauling the enemy, materially
improved the local situation. Apparently
it was good work, swiftly and bravely done,
and puts another feather in Billjim’s hat.
It is casually mentioned that while the
troops were assembling for the attack
Hughes suddenly materialised and threw
“brief, tense speeches” at them. The
Bulletin assumes that between this .circum-
stance and the prompt carrying of the
objectives there is the relation of cause and
effect. Anyway the bolt from the speech-
laden atmosphere to the shelter of the Ger-
man trenches appears to have been sudden
and precipitate. In the interval of waiting
for what happens next it may be as well not
to forget that relatively small engagements
such as this may easily have their signifi-
cance greatly exaggerated. Hundreds of
them have occurred since the disturbance
opened. _ They are not in truth much more
than incidents in the big. fateful collisions
which really count. This is a war of
masses of men and hardware, with little
battles sprinkled in between the great erup-
tions of hate. In the next all-in scrap that
develops the enemy can be expected to deliver
the heaviest smack he is capable of handing
the Allies. The comparative failure of the
last deliveries and the rapid materialisation
of Uncle Sam are powerful reasons why
Ludendorff should hit to the full extent of
his power. Every week’s delay makes the job
he has in hand harder, for the Allies resist-
ance is being strengthened by every trans-

Land for Soldiers that They May Not
Get.
“Farepa” : Under the Returned Soldiers’
Settlement Act 191$ as amended by the
Act of 1917, the N. S. Wales Minister for
Lands is allowed to issue to any discharged
soldier or any person applying for land on
behalf of a soldier or sailor serving abroad
a “certificate of preferential r ght entitling
the recipient to the farm or block described
therein.” The person benefiting is “deemed
to have had such farm or block confirmed to
him without reference to the local Land
Board.” It is provided that “in the notifica-
tion of the setting apart of any area
designed exclusively for the holders of pre-
ferential right certificates, such notification
shall state that the land so set. apart shall
be available only for the holders of such
certificates.” This opens the door to corrup-
tion in the administration of the Lands Acts
specially amended to meet the demands
of soldier settlement. The provision of
preferential rights to apply for any land is a
mistake;. but to impose the policy upon a
scheme aiming at the settlement of returned
soldiers is worse. Cases of gazettal of pre-
ferential rights over choice blocks have
already occurred and will continue to occur
while the Act stands. In one instance a
fine area became available in the Nyngan
district. In the same Gazette wherein the
land was set apart appeared the names of
five preferential right holders, the mere
gazettal of whose names confirmed the blocks
to them. How was the public to know
that the land was available? Inquiry might
have elicited the information and it might
not. What is most important about the
case quoted, however, is the fact that the
demand for _ the blocks thus given away
would certainly have required a ballot, as
the applicants would have exceeded the areas
available.
If the Federal Government had stuck to its
original intention of fixing the wholesale
price of meat for local consumption at the
export rate, minus freezing charges, it would
have done all that was necessary and escaped
heaping trouble on its head. What has
happened now is that by producing an iron-
clad schedule of prices, regardless of quality,
which has only a microscopical variation
from rates hitherto prevailing, the Govern-
ment gets no thanks and jeers from all
quarters. This is not the first time
attempts have been made to regulate the
price of the chop and the steak. In Banana-
land the Government has done the job with
some measure of success. In N. S. Wales
experiments were made by the State price-
fixing committee with results that were gen-
erally calamitous. llow the Ministry was
fooled by the market operators is explained
in detail in a report from the Inter-State
Commission. The point of the Commission’s
recommendation was that, to put the market-
rigger in his place, the export parity should
be made the basis of wholesale dealing; that
it was far more important to throw this indi-
vidual out of action than to fumble round
with retail prices. The Federal Govern-
ment's scheme goes in an opposite direction
and gets the sirlion tangled up with the piece
of chuck and leaves the leg of mutton at
the old address, with the net result of placing
the Government before the public as the
defender of the profiteer and an aider and
abettor of extortion on the consumer. Does
a continuance of exorbitant prices help to
win the war? Does it incite the populace
to enlist? As Acting Prime Minister Watt
is fond of announcing that these are the
paramount issues in public policy, he might
explain.
“Wool Clakskh” : Following upon recent re-
marks in The Bulletin concerning the
export of stud merinoes to South Africa and
elsewhere, the folly of such proceeding has
been vividly shown by the events of the stud-
sheep sales which have recently caused an
influx of country men into Sydney. It was
noticeable that many of the stud, or alleged
stud, sheep, sent to the sales were distinctly
below the standard of the past. The infer-
ence—in fact, it is more than an inference —-
is that, tempted by the big price for wool
offered by the British Government, sheep-
breeders are not so particular in culling out
the tame and woolly animals that represent
so much money in. these peculiar times. If
this bad business is to continue—and nothing
can ston it except the good sense of the
breeders themselves—and it is to be accom-
panied by the export of some of our best
sheep blood abroad, it is only a matter of a
few years when the industry will be in the
mud. Expert wool men reckon that, with
the shortage of flocks all over the world,
accentuated by the slaughter of animals in
Europe, the Loom won’t last, and Australian
sheepmen will have no excuse for what will
come to them if they deliberately allow the
standard of the Australian merino to degen-
erate.
The mocking nature of wine referred to by
the ancient Bible prophets seems to exem-
plify itself in the case of the Australian
wine trade. Xo country is better suited
for wine production than Australia. Sun
and soil are right; and skill gained from
experience goes to the making of liquids
that should have a ready market in every
outside land. At the recent Sydney exhibit
of the State wine-growers a stump of a vine
90 years old was shown. It carried a relic
in that, more than 40 years ago the southern
district of N. S. Wales sent wine to England.
Yet the wine-growing industry in Aus-
tralia is still in its infancy, and under
the stress of war it is in danger of being
weakened. As an industry wine-growing is
of real value; for the cultivation of the vine
is an occupation which enforces the workers
into bright sun and air. Wine-growing
countries are sober countries. Where
wine is the common drink of the people the
taste is cultivated towards the lighter and
less alcoholic forms. Heavy beers and
stronger spirits seem strangely out of place
in Australia; and there is no doubt that
with careful fostering our taste for
light wines could be developed to a point
which would make imported ales and spirits
appear an enemy. Wine-growing means a
lot to Australia. For the returned soldier,
Partly incapacitated, the cultivation of the
grape offers one of the lightest and healthiest
occupations; aud the poor and otherwise
almost valueless lands are in most cases
capable of growing wines of the finest
quality.

A cure for Unaccountable Paralysis should
luive a big sale just now. As one instance
out of many: Britain, in its desperate need
for soldiers to keep the Iluns out of Aus-
tialia and other places, is enrolling another
50.000 coal-miners in the army. That means
224 million tons less coal dug per year, and
makes the output 35 million tons a ’ year
below requirements. This means an un-
paralleled market for the N. S. Wales coal-
miners who are complaining bitterly
(against the Government) about lack of
work. 1 lie trouble is lack of ships to carry
coal. Despite the feverish output of new
ships in the United States, Canada, Britain,
Japan and France, and some output in Nor-
way, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Italy,
China and certain South American repub-
lics. ships wear out or are killed off faster
than they are built. So tlierfe is little to he
hoped tor from the industrious foreigner.
Our own Governments are trying in a mild
way to do something, but not. one Govern-
ment ship is more than commenced yet, and
the report is always that it is hard to got
workers even at the wages agreed upon, and
hard to get them to take much interest in
the work. A sodden Something sets heavily
on the chest of affairs. If men were making
lots of money at coal-mining and shipbuild-
ing it would, of course, diminish discontent
and reduce grievances. Then the Bolshevik
of the Labor Conference and the Sydney
Domain would have a cold time. It is his
life-work to point out witli his flexible mouth
that the only redress for all grievances is to
put him into power, legally or otherwise,
and trust him to bring about the same mil-
lennium that Russia is enjoying. Ilis job as
a middleman would be gone if people were
too busy making money to listen to him.
Apparently lie is the Something Sitting on
the Chest, and the cause of the Invisible
Paralysis.
An old link between The Bulletin and
the stage was broken last week by the sud-
den death of Joseph Norgrove. Thirty years
ago. and more, Norgrove saw a lot of Aus-
tralia as a member of Wybert Reeve’s co..
and he travelled around as a minor supporter
of the irascible Bandmaiin what time Walter
Baker was a young beginner in the profesli.
Norgrove, who dropped his surname of
Clutterbuck when he took to using grease-
paint, was not a very good actor, but he was
always a very good fellow. For the past 20
years or so his long, silvery locks were the sole
remaining evidence of his theatrical past.
Every good advertiser in Melbourne knew
Joseph Norgrove as The Bulletin’s local
business representative, and where he was
known he was much liked and respected.
Superintendent Roche, of the N. S. Wales
police force, on his retirement, reminisced
about Butler, the Blue Mountain murderer,
Roche, as a detective, brought Butler back
from San Francisco, on a steamer that
carried Miss Maggie Moore. Said Roche :
At first Butler would not have anything to eat. . . .
he tried all sorts of tricks with him to induce him
to eat, but he refused. Miss Maggie Moore came
to our assistance, and she used to go down outside
his cabin and sing.
Which is interesting in a way. The episode
was mentioned in The Bulletin at the
time, and one of the most strenuous days in
the then dramatic critic’s life was when Miss
Moore came to his room, bringing a female
witness with her, and repudiated the alleged
melody as if it was an asnersion on her
character. Perhaps Mr. Roche had been
talking of some other murderer and the com-
positor mixed them up. or perhaps it was
Paderewski who sang to Butler and not Miss
Moore.

“(Hi, Boy!” the latest American musical
show to reach Australia through the Firm,
is all froth, sparkle and sweetness like an
American soft-drink, and a big first-night
audience at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) swal-
lowed it greedily. Its chief charm is Jerome
Kern’s music, and the distinctive dresses and
costumes by Lady Duff Gordon give the show
a strong millinery interest which might lead
women playgoers to agree, for once, anyhow,
that it is the best-dressed production of re-
cent years at a J.C.W. house. Two fine sets
by scenic-artist Leslie Board (a luxurious
flat and a country clubhouse) provide the
backgrounds. The “book.” by Guy Bolton
and P. G. Wodehouse, flashes, fairly fre-
quently, though some of the allusions are
too ’Murkan for Australians to catch. The
ingenue's job provides a big chance for Grade
Lavers, a local girl and a J.C.W. graduate.
She is slight, has large, expressive eyes, is an
efficient actress and a graceful dancer. Her
voice is small, hut Kern’s music doesn’t make
great demands, and the reliable chorus is
always handy. Miss Lavers, ns Lou Kllen

little Rita Nugent can have a line to them-
selves for their particular line of comedy.
Margaret Wycherly continues to expose
the murderer of Spencer Lee at the Criterion
(Sydney) according to the rules of “The
Thirteenth Chair.” The proceedings inciden-
tal to unmasking the villain afford the local
Hop mighty good reason for being thankful
that his chance of promotion doesn’t depend
on the fist lie would make of getting the cul-
prit in similar circumstances. There is one
.conspicuous merit about this play, namely,
the explanation it gives of how to get rid
of an enemy with the least risk of unpleas-
ant consequences: Invite him to a seance in
a locked room, and when the company is
seated in the dark holding hands it; is only
necessary to secretly stab him in the back.
In case the implemeni used might give a
clue it is wise to either get rid of it by
swallowing or, what is better, to surreptiti-
ously borrow a carver from a restaurant and
leave it sticking in the victim. To avoid
arrest it will only be necessary to stand around
in a state of regretful astonishment and
keep quiet. Hitherto Tiie Bulletin always
figured it out that the only way to be sure
of escaping detection for homicide was to do
the deed in broad daylight in a crowded
street, but “The Thirteenth Chair” convinces
it that there is nothing like a seance for the
purpose. The citizen who goes to commune
with spooks without a boiler-plate waistcoat
seems to be taking fearful risks. But “The
Thirteenth Chair” is a slick play. If it
baffles reason it also baffles speculation on
the Solution. The acting is almost uniformly
good. In the case of The Bulletin's old
friend Gaston Mervale, disguised as John
Crosby, it is excellent.

Ada Reeve and the supporting vaudevil-
lains will wind their season up on Friday
night at Sydney Tivoli. The new revue,
“Bits and Pieces” (Espinosa, producer),
begins on Saturday, the principals- being
mostly those who were concerned in the
successful “Samples.”

The Fullers ought to put something heavy
on the roof of the Opera House (Sydney)
say the State’s financial outlook —otherwise
it 'will be blown off before the Doone season
ends. On Saturday the usual cyclone of
applause greeted Allen when he appeared in
another love story, though still pursuing the
same Edna Iveeley, masquerading under the
name of “Molly Bawn.” From the first shuffle
of the plot you knew that Edna was going
to win the dashing young Irishman's heart,
and that he would win a fortune with her
favor. The other threads of the story were
in the capable hands of Frank Cullenane,
Ethel Bashford and Geo. Hewlett. On Satur-
day “The Bold Soger Boy” marches to the
fore.
The local musician who can keep a Sydney
audience not only awake, but at times almost
electrified by a whole evening’s performance
of her own compositions, is as uncommon as
snow on South Head. Yet one. at least,
exists. Esther Kahn’s manuscript concert
in the King’s Hall this week was the musi-
cal event of a hitherto dull season. Iho
young composer has a great gift of melody
that will make her works a boom if she is
lured to U.S.A. when Peace flaps its wings.
But music publishers are shy. The price
of paper would make almost a patent-
medicine advertiser shy. The concert was
none the worse for the manuscript score. In
a long list of compositions the Sonata for
violin and piano; a group of songs with
Adeline Greer to sing them (after the war
the boy in the street will try to whistle
some of these charming melodies) ; a Bene-
dictus with organ obligato; and a Fantasie
for two pianos were important additions to
contemporary concert music. A Reverie for
the ’cello, with Bryce Carter to interpret,
was a luscious interlude.
If the spirits of the departed ever come
back from the Beyond. Mark Twain will be
hovering around the front rows of Hoyt’s and

thereby making the book more popular even
than of old. On the Crystal, Palace screen
Constance Talmadge divorces her husband
before she has unpacked her honeymoon
lingerie. Which is somewhat sudden even in
these precarious days. The Strand sheet lies
mislaid its heroine this week, but William S.
Hart’s hell-fire shooting and marvellous rid-
ing as “The Patriot” tills all requirements.
Under the title of “The Heart of a Lion”
the Lyceum screens Ralph Connor’s novel
“The Doctor.” William Farnuin plays the
lead in this story of brotherly love carried
to extremes.
Mabel Normand is flitting across the screen
at the Royal (Sydney) in “Dodging a
Million,” a film drama which is proudly
advertised as having all the mystery of a
detective story without the sord'd- crime.
But in American drama the ’tec is often more
sordid than the crime and more objectionable
than the corpse.

The Playhouse (Sydney) has been the
stopping-place of a succession of small,
bright shows, and theatregoers now know
that it is worth while keeping an eye on the
twinkling cos, that come and go at the band-
box next the big fire-station m Castlereagli-
street. The Frivolities, who rolled up the
curtain on July 4, keep up the bright tra-
ditions of the house. Amongst them are
Ives Sanders, an excellent tenor, and Vera
Passmore, a pleasing mezzo-soprano. If the
Fire Brigade turns up late at any fires this
month the public may safely assume that
the brass helmets missed the call through
listening to the singers next door.
The somewhat mysterious story of “De
Luxe Annie” has already endeared Miss
Emelie Polini to Melbourne, and _ local
womankind will be rushing the King’s for
some weeks to come. Every woman is _at
heart a crook of gentle Annie’s interesting
type. The idea of being an honest charmer
in receipt of a dishonest income of 10.000
dollars a year appeals to the trickiest feel-
ings of the sex. Also the notion of being
pursued by a devoted hubby, who can’t make
you remember that you once loved him, is
flattering unction to the feminine soul. The
play is entertaining, too. from the male point
of view. Emelie Polini is a fresh, frank and
unaffected actress, with an expressive voice
and considerable emotional force. She
tends to naturalise every scene she touches.
This remark hardly applies to anybody else
in the east. Perhaps an exception can be
made of Harford, as Annie’s butler. This
menial is either an unmitigated rogue or an
agent in a good cause, but in either capacity
he gives no clue to his character. He re-
mains a mere matter-of-fact drop in the
ocean of mystery.
"The Man Who Came Back,” at the
Royal (Melbourne), continues to upbraid the
cruel fate which gave him a ten-cent charac-
ter and a millionaire father. Endowed with
a ten-cent father and a million-dollnr intel-
lect he wouldn’t have sought dissipation in
cabarets, or happiness in opium-dens. So
tin* drama is really a warning to sons who
pick the wrong dads, and rice versa. Also
it is a study in make-believes. Potter junior
tries to persuade himself that he is looking-
for a new life, whilst he is bent on returning
to New York; Marcelle pretends to be de-
gradingly doped, when she is actually test-
ing the weakness of her poor little Potter;
Frank Harvey is stated to have been a-loyal
private detective in the employment of old
man Potter when he made furious love to
his employer’s daughter-in-law, and he (Har-
vey) married an awful young woman whom
no reasonable ’tec would touch, except with
a pair of handcuffs. The job of private-
detecting for old man Potter seems to be
have been fraught with strange impossibili-
ties.

If there be any cause or reason why

vious fact. The moment lie waves his hand
ar the atmosphere the lights go out, and the
few remarks with which he improves the
occasion are worthy of Marie Corelli at her
worst. They are devilish silly.
Barry Lupino lends his valuable enthusi-
asm to the revue of “Time, Please.” which
was turned on at the Tivoli (Melbourne) on
Saturday. Barry gets full honors for a series
of freak characters which show a comprehen-
sive gift for caricature. His wowser waiter
in “Supper Time” has many dexterous turns
of humor, and there is also a comic reality
about his Ole Bill in the Bairnsfather sketch.
Elsewhere his trained legs rhyme with Espi-
nosa’s in a poetic measure, and he has some
agile work as Ferdie which is a rest cure
in comparison to his other activities. Espi-
nosa’s quality as a dancer seems somewhat
diminished by the vicinity of Lupino. but
he is a sprightly streak of yellow as Midday
in the pleasing “Ballet of the Hours.”
Beatrice Holloway is not at her best in the
farce. For Marie Eaton life is just one
d—d sing after another, and Fred Monu-
ment fills in time with his furious baritone.
Billy Rego causes an occasional bubble of
laughter, but he appears lonely and limited
without his old-established partner, George
Welch. The extra ladies have the requisite
dinkiness, pinkness and dash, and every
piquant foot knows its place in the perform-
ance.
The Stanhope show continues at the Bijou
(Melb.). This week the disturbance is
“Twirly Whirly,” which is remarkable for
another cheap edition of Spike Murphy, in
which character Paul Stanhope is most him-
self. In the front section of the bill
there are one or two performers that
take the raw edge off the revue —particularly
Kelly and Drake, a bright songful damsel and
an agile lad whose legs have discovered a
new field of eccentric behavior. The hat-
spinning and juggling Testros are revivals, as
are I,)e Baker’s Models.
Jack l’ickford, in “Tom Sawyer” at Hoyt's
(Melb.) this week, is making many regret
that they hadn’t become acquainted with
Mark Twain earlier. It is an especially
sparkling feature which hangs on to the
original text with a tenacity unusual in
mdvie adaptations. In the joke called
“The Bell Boy” Fatty Arbuekle heaves his
superfluous tissue into some violent situa-
tions. Several spools of tragedy bear the
distraught countenance of Dorothy Dalton,
who is beset by a Past that won’t lie down.
“Tarzan of the Apes” is streaking past
tin. astounded gaze of Majestic (Melbourne)
supporters this week. Tarzan. the offspring
of a nobleman, is mothered by an ape, and
his adventures among pythons and other
insects verge on delirium tremens. The ex-
ploits of De Rougemont are as a liftman’s
job in a Bible warehouse in comparison to
Tarzan’s strange experiences. In the other
half of the programme Norma Talmadge
peeps beguilingly from “The Honeymoon."
and there is a stimulating vision of Aiizacs
in New York.
The afternoon-show business in Adelaide
is so good that West’s Pictures have decided
to cut in at it. Their strongest draw for the
moment is Chaplin and his dog. Won-
dergraph has a strong programme, contrast-
ing William Hart, of the ready revolver, with
the new-style comedy of the flapper “Bab.”
The Royal has gone back to pictures for a
time, and shows a moving story, in both
senses, of the Civil War. The Tivoli lias a
monopoly of the spoken drama, and continues
its plan of reviving old-time successes. "The
Octoroon” goes almost as well as ever.
Marie Dalton is the heroine, Guy Hastings
plays Salem Scudder, and Fitzlierbert is the
villain with the scowl and the long purse.
On the light side are Flockton Foster and a
company of Scarlet Gaieties at the King’s,
reopened for the occasion. Good voices go
well in the operatic selections, and the little
house is just the place for this class of
entertainment. At the Majestic, Bessie
Lester and Ernest Pitcher are raising health-
ful laughter, and the second half of the show
is filled up agreeably by Walter Johnson’s
crowd with various kinds of musical fooling.
There was humor (probably unconscious)
about a Sydney Sunday' paper’s account of
how W. M. J lughes talked (how lie loves
talking) to the Australian soldiers in France.
He said that we must give “all for Aus-
tralia, ’’ but when he wanted compulsory ser-
vice, and had a majority for it in the House
of Reps., he didn’t even risk his billet for
Australia. He took a Referendum, presu-
mably for the purpose of finding out how he
would stand at next election, and when the
voting told him that he might not stand very
well if he bogged in for his ideal he didn't
take any chances.
There is a pile of paper several feet high
in The Bulletin office, mostly composed of
instructions, directions and exhortations from
the Censor relative to what may and may
not be said under the War Precautions Act.
It would hurt this paper to part with any of
these documents, for some day their value
will be beyond price. But it would willingly
lend some of the literature to Lieut.-Colonel
Knox, C.M.G., who appears to have queer
ideas about the way to get the best results
on a recruiting campaign, Speaking at Mel-
bourne last week he is reported to have made
some genial remarks of which this is a
sample:—
The damned cold-footed skunks walking about the
streets who have been frightened to put the uniform
on. The swine ought to bo over at the Front.
The question is not how much assistance this
sort of talk gives to recruiting, but how much
it injures the business. In view of all the
circumstances, it seems to be up to the
Minister for Defence to call off some of these
tactless whoopers who if they were to simi-
larly cut loose for the Anti-side in the
Domain or Yarra Bank would probably be
muzzled in a very sudden and effective way
DE LUXE ANNIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A story strange and fairly droll,
Related in a novel way,
Concerning a deluded soul
And riiemory that went astray,
Belonging to a spieler’s mate
Who prospered on a false pretence.
But made a point of keeping straight
Along the line of Innocence.
A blaclonailijig girl seeking orders for Books
Was Annie de Luxe.
Unconscious of her marriage vows
Fair Annie, free from moral stain,
On meeting her forgotten spouse
Was smitten by him once again;
But, governed by her spieler mate,
The lady’s mental light was dim:
So poor old hubby had to wait
Until his wife remembered him.
Oddest of angels and quaintest of crooks
Was Annie de Luxe.
Sweet Annie, fleeing from the Law,
Sought refuge in a cottage home,
And there her former self she saw—
Herself ere she began to roam;
Remembering her former past,
Recovered from her later life,
She knew her husband’s name at last,
And was again his little wife.
Happy again with her song-birds and cliooks.
Homely housekeeper and cutest of cooks,
Sometimes alone in the shadiest nooks,
Fishing for gudgeon with worms upon hooks
Or reading most highly respectable books,
With hardly a vague recollection of crooks
(Except when she hears the harsh cawing of rooks)
Is Annie de Luxe.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Australia has committed itself to a Gov-
ernment paper currency, which is as wise a
thing as it could have done, though, as in the
case of wine (which may lead to drunken-
ness), and water (which may leud to drown-
ing), and food (which may cause suffocation
when bolted), and boots (which give rise to
corns), unwise people may produce strange
results with it. This country might take
hints from oluer practitioners. Chili, Brazil
and the Argentine Republic may be quoted
(though there are other examples) as pros-
perous countries whose position, though not
so bad as ours in some respects, presents a
resemblance. There the financial statement
is in two sections —receipts of paper, good for
local purposes as with us, aud expenditure
covered by paper; while on the other side
are receipts in gold good for all purposes, and
expenditure in gold, which includes interest
and sinking fund on the foreign debt, and
other payments for which only coin will
serve. There may bo a surplus or a deficit
in either kind of money, but the two are
not mixed, and the community knows how
it stands. The situation isn’t kept dark.
In Australia the two things are mixed. So
the Federal and State accounts might be
lumped together in any one year and show
that income was £20,1)00,000 ahead of out-
goings, and yet the country might be bank-
rupt. It might have £40,000.000 more
paper money than it required .and be
£20,000,000 short of the pile of sovereigns
necessary to pay its foreign interest bill.
There would be a very big surplus and there
would also be a very big downfall, and the
mass of the community might have no clear
idea that anything was wrong till the value
of notes slumped almost out of sight. Things
are kept dark—even murky. The wise com-
munity which has a paper currency and a
big foreign debt acts on a simple principle.
It recognises that foreign imports call for
gold and are one chief source of danger.
Therefore it not only puts duties on imports
but makes these duties payable in gold only.
The idea of accepting notes in payment of
duties on goods which can’t themselves be
paid for in notes is regarded as a mixing of
affairs which should be kept separate. If
a scarcity of the world-wide circulating
medium suddenly raises the gold dollar to
twice the value of the paper dollar then the
20 per cent, duty becomes 40 per cent, on
the instant, and the imports which the coun-
try can’t afford to pay for get an extra set-
back. The exe'se on local beer being pay-
able in paper, the price of local beer goes
down in time of stress, as it ought to do; the
Customs tax on foreign beer being payable
in gold the price of foreign beer goes up,
which serves it right. The idea of the
double-barrelled budget would necessitate
the Commonwealth taking over all foreign
debts, with possibly the principal assets,
such as railways, which they reoresent. It
would also necessitate the absolute prohibi-
tion of new foreign borrowing on the payt of
States and local bodies. Then the Com-
monwealth would own, as it does now, the
Customs, which the knowledge of countries
which have been longer on the job than w T e
shows to be the only big and feasible gold-
collecting agency. It would have first call
by reason of this collecting on the gold suu-
ply of the country for the security of the
foreign debt and other foreign liabilities. Tt
would hold the gold reserve against notes
as it does now. And it would be responsible
for. the one big and unavoidable liability
which calls for gold. Australia is very new
and fresh in the Government note business.
It is only 41 years since the Federal cur-
rency became big enough to be worth men-
tioning. There hasn’t been time yet to
realise the amazing nossibilities of a system
under which the State Governments have
immense payments to make in sovereigns,
while the Federal authority is busy taking
sovereigns from the banks in exchange for
“rag” monev. in order to meet its own pay-
ments. and controls the coin reserve, and
the only collecting agency which can demand
payment in hard yellow money without
breaking the whole industrial machine. It
is a case of hunting in the dark for calamity.
This is a new reason for unification created
bv new circumstances, and it is one of the
biggest reasons to date.

The principal feature of this co.’s business
has been interfered with by adverse condi-
tions in the buikLng trade and by the uncer-
tainty as to the future. Its chief Lne is
house-purchase insurance—a scheme which
enables a man to insure his life aud at the
same time solve the rent problem by provid-
ing him with his own house. Policies are'
issued for terms covering 12, 15 or 20 years,
and on payment of the first premium tiie co.
will advance 15 p..c. of the value of a house,
which must be less than the amount of the
policy. If the advance is not sought at once,
at. increased percentage of advance may be
secured after the. policy lias been in force
several years, until, after the fifth year, the
full value of the house will be advanced.
The co. holds a mortgage on the property,
and interest is, of course, charged—but com-
pared with the usual charges it is cheap
money. Having secured his own house the
policy-holder has the satisfaction of knowing
that in the event of his death his dependants
are not only provided with a home of their
own but also receive the margin between
the amount for which he was insured and
the sum still owing on the property, plus
any bonuses that have accumulated. This
scheme is quite a legitimate side-line of life in-
surance ; but under present conditions it needs
to be handled with extreme caution. The Assur-
ance and Thrift is fortunate in having as
its founder and managing-director W. It.
Dovey, an actuary of good professional
standing. As a result, at present the
co. is proceeding cautiously, and the house-
purchase branch of its business is being re-
stricted. . Last year 315 new life policies
were written, but only about one-fifth were
included in the house-purchase scheme.
The encouragement of thrift is the co.’s chief
mission. During the past year 77 acres were
purchased outside Newcastle, where it is
proposed to establish a garden suburb for
the coal city. This, say the directors, will
“meet the desires of a number of thrifty
families,” while proving a good investment
for the.co. The scheme is an admirable one,
for besides providing a home in pleasant sur-
roundings, the industrious can on their one-
or two-acre blocks put in spare-time labor
growing vegetables, etc., and thus lighten
the. cost of living. Any scheme such as this
which makes life easier and more attractive
for the worker deserves well of the com-
munity.
In common with other cos. the Assurance
and Thrift’s life figures for the past year
have been affected by an increased death
rate. The following shows how premiums
hove grown and how expenses have been
kept down:—•
1913. 1916. 1917. 1918.

Interest and profit on
investments .. 2997 2939 3,016 2,898
Expenses .. .. 5518 5379 5,756 5,868
As an adjunct to its house-purchase and
ordinary life business, the co. does a little
fire and accident and sickness insurance. In
the Accident branch premiums last year
totalled £312 and claims £6O. Fire pre-
miums amounted to £5"6 and only £5 was
piiid out in claims. Expenses in the two
departments absorbed £507.
Subscribed capital is 53,053 shares of £1
each, and £17.684 has been nnid on. Assur-
ance funds now total £32,418. £31.788 of
which belongs to the life and house-purchase
branch. To nss\st in financing its schemes
the eo. has fixed deposits totalling £2695;
and all other liabilities amount to £1620.
The big item among the assets, of course, is
mortgages—£-10,982 of a total of £56.018.
Of the balance, £2553 is in freeho’d pro-
perty, £5153 in property loans, £1347 in
loans on polimes. £5745 in cash. etc., and
the rest in edds and ends of office furniture
and stationery, etc. Shareholders’ div’dends
have hitherto h"en at the rate of 4 p.c. p.a.;
this year the Board recommends the distri-
bution of an additional 1 p.c. as a bonus. At
March 31 managirg-directnr IVvey made an
actuarial investigation. lie estimates Mo net
liabirty in the life department at £26 995:
so after setting aside £BB4 efividerd and
bonus for sbareboHers and £450 for deferred
lwnus. the funds show a surplus of £3459.
This he recommends sbouM be distributed as
follows: (1) bonus of 1 p.c. to pol’cies
entitled to immediate partieipation for each
year they b Q ve been ip force sine" the fast
valuation, absorbing £1969- (21 adding £.500
to deferred bonus fund; (3) adding £395 to
reserve fund, making it £2000; and (4)
carrying forward the balance of £595.

Every three years this co. has what it calls
a “distribution of surplus profits.” During
the past three years profits have totalled
£45 835 and a 10 p.c. dividend has absorbed
£2S.ITO. From the balance of £17,665 the
directors have now declared a bonus of 2
p.c. for each of the past three years, making
the average dividend 12 p.c. p.a. Out: of last
year’s profits there has been deducted bor-
rowers’ bonuses amounting to £1396; so the
profits were really £15.872. That amount
alone would have provided the whole of the
16 p.c. dividend distributed to shareholders.
Profits are thus very handsome: in six years
they have almost totalled the paid-up capital
of £93,900. And in view of strenuous com-
petition—particularly from the State-owned
savings banks—the performance is somewhat
surprising. The war has affected the co.
in several ways. A lot of outs’de money,
which in normal times would have been
available for mortgages, has been invested
in. War Loans; consequently the number of
applications for advances received by the
Equitable has increased. Also, money is
dearer, and that means added profits on'new
business. On the other hand the shortage
of building materials and increased costs,
combined with the uncertainty as to the
future, have called for caution in making
advances. Tlrs shows how new advances
have been granted :
1909.. £64,004 1914.. £104,825
1910.. 76,622 1915.. 82,093
1911.. 89,643 1910.. 71,907
1912.. 115,455 1917.. 85.482
1913.. 116,687 1918.. 75,797
At March 31,1 1914, mortgages totalled
£330,552 and liquid assets £30,080; mort-
gages now amount to £316,414, and liquid
assets £58,255, of which £44.000 is in “tem-
porary investments.” Capital is £93.9f)0.
and there are reserves of £81.014, which
gives a total of £175,514 of the co.’s own
money in the business. To finance advances
it depends on deposits, £221 098. So. for
every £1 of its own the co. holds about £1 ss.
of other people’s money. The banks work on
between three to nine times more outside
money than they have in shareholders’ funds.

This co. was formed to take over two rival
billiard-table manufacturing cos.—Heiron &
Smith’s and Aicock’s. Later on Sherwood’s,
Ltd., wall-paper business was bought in and
various's; de-lines have since been tacked on,
not least important of which is the manu-
facture of a gramophone which is command-
ing good sales. To secure these varied in-
terests £60,087 has been paid for goodwill,
trade-marks, etc., which explains the deficit
column iu the table above. War conditions
have led the eo. into new enterprises, and. as
the directors put it, “what four years ago
represented a concern dealing practically in
luxuries, has been transformed into one of
greater vitality and wider scope. The fac-
tory is. show'ng its resourcefulness in the
production of goods that were previously im-
ported and which were never made in Aus-
tralia before.” . And while the co. has
thus been experimenting in new lines it has
been able to maintain its profits. Trad'ng
profit for the past year was £22 601. com-
pared w : th £21,049 in 1917 and £17.375 in
1916. The directors have done a wise thing
in utilising the co.’s organisation to manu-
facture necessities. It is not at all clear
how hardly the Commonwealth will fare
during the next few years. When war
expenditure ceases and we begin to sober up
and settle down to re-adjusting our financial
arrangements there will prolwbly be little
domard for luxuries —for a time, anyhow.
And if. me°nvhile. Heiron & Smith can fur-
ther extend the manufacture of
in will be in a better position to weather
any duff times that may l ; e ahead. That is
prov’d'd, of course, the Federal Government
protects manufacturers from dumped goods.
A feature of the co.’s business is a billiard-
table hire-purchase system. The sundry
debtors item is -consequently substantial—
£4s,s69 at March 31 last. Liabilities
total £25,903. On the other side, in
addition to the sundry debtors item already
mentioned, there is £28,072 of stock; pro-
perty, £15,619; plant, etc., £5381; shares in
other cos., £1646; and odds and ends. £539.
Capital is £116,164, made up of 56,164 6p.c.
prefs. of £1 each and 60,000 £1 ordinaries.

The C.F.S. is a striking example of what
co-operation means to the primary pro-
ducer. Established by seven farmers sub-
scribing £l3O of capital in 1000, the society
has gone ahead by leaps:—

In the IS years the co. has been in business
bonuses to.ailing £169,761 have been dis-
tributed among co-operators. For the past
live years alone the rebates on commissions
paid by consignors have amounted to almost
£90,000'; or, putting it another way, during
that period co-operation lias saved these N. S.
Wales dairy-farmers at least £90,000 which
would otherwise have gone into the middle-
men’s pockets, But the co-operator receives
more than a cash advantage in a society like
this: the co. is owned and controlled by the
producers, who thus have a powerful organ-
isation which studies their interests all the
time. *
As tire figures above show, last year’s
trading eclipsed all previous records. The
arrangements made by the Commonwealth
Government for handling the exportable sur-
plus of butter and cheese was a big factor iu
the year’s success. Altogether the society
handled 11,000 tons’ butter and 153,2381 b.
cheese, and producers get an added 5 p.c. rebate
on their commissions, making the total bonus
30 p.c., two-thirds of which is returned in
cash and the remainder allotted in shares.
The grain department continues to expand,
and the bonuses for the past year were in-
creased from 10 p.c. to 15 p.c. Meantime
the fruit and vegetable section, started a
couple of years ago, is making rapid pro-
gress, and another 220 orchardists joined
during the past 12 months, making a total of
527 co-operators. This department is now
firmly established and a profit of £1396 was
made last year. Recent extensions of the co-
operative principle in the Speck promise to
considerably increase the coming year’s busi-
ness.
Paid-up capital is now £40,565, and
hitherto shareholders have received an un-
interrupted 6 p.c. dividend. This year the
rate has been increased to 7 p.c. The pre-
sent capital, however, is inadequate for the
big busiuess the society is handling, and an
effort is being made to induce co-operators
to increase their holding of shares. A re-
markable feature of the co. is the tremendous
turnover of over two-and-a-half millions’
worth of produce on combined capital and
reserves of only a little over £42.000. and
practically no debts other than amounts due
to consignors, representing considerably less
than a fortnight’s trading'. This is possible
only because of the cash nature of the busi-
ness-fortnightly settlements by buying cus-
tomers being strictly enforced.
The Riverina Woollen Manufacturing
Co., Ltd., was formed at Wagga (N.S.W. >
in 1915 with the object of establishing the
woollen manufacturing industry where the
wool grows. Everything looked bright when
the prospectus was issued. The local wool-
growers became interested, and there were
no less than four graziers on the first Board
of seven. Nominal capital Was 50,000 £1
shares, and the promoters were to get
nothing in the way of bonus shares or allow-
ances. Slow progress, however, was made
getting in capital, but by December last by
a special effort had been subscribed
(though only £6444 had been called up) and
the directors had purchased nine acres on the
Murrumb’dsree and were arranging to secure
plant and to erect the mill. They discovered,
however, that there was practically no hope
of obtaining plant from abroad under two
years, so it was decided to have a look
round to see if the co.’s capital could be
invested elsewhere. The directors in March
secured au option over the Tasmanian

Woollen Mills, Hobart, and completed pur-
chase at the beginning of this month. The
purchase price has not been officially given,
but it is understood to be in the vicinity of
£50,000. The financing of the purchase,
however, is apparently not going to be easy,
and the co. will have to mortgage the
machinery and lean on the bank. After
deducting 3000 forfeited shares subscribed
capital amounts to about £32,000, but as
calls are limited to 2s. (id. every three
months this amount will not be available till
towards the end of next year. The co. hopes,
however, to sell the remaining 18,000 shares
at a premium. Preliminary expenses have
so far absorbed £3607.
A. R. Sennett. a consulting-engineer and
for many years a M.1.C.E., M.1.M.E.,
M.1.E.E., was retained some time ago to
report upon the N. S. Wales molybdenite
industry. He spent much time in the Yet-
holme district, and while holding a high
opinion of the magnitude and importance of
the deposits, considers it unwise to endeavor
to work the field by small concerns and
isolated units, and points out the great
advantages which would accrue from a
scheme of co-operative working. Here,
briefly, are his recommendations: — ,
An entirely separate company should be formed to
instal plant for crushing and separation capable of
treating the ore mined upon all the claims of the
district. This plant would play the part in regard to
the molybdenite industry precisely that the co-opera-
tive dairy co. does in a dairying district. It would
occupy a suitable position to which the ore would
be ran down upon aerials. By reason of its largo
size the crushing and treatment plant would be, pro-
portionately, much cheaper in lirst cost, much higher
in working efficiency, and much more economically
productive. It would supply all requisite motive
power, produced with a maximum of economy and at
a minimum of cost. It would comprise Uiree distinct
units —the crushing, the separation and the power-
station. The latter, in addition to driving the mill,
would also supply power to all the mining cos.
desiring it. The power would be obtained from inter-
nal combustion engines in combination with dynamo-
electric machines, and with a degree of economy un-
approachable by steam engines. From every consid-
eration it will be found that great advantages are
in favor of a centralised power-station and treatment
plant. The advantages to the mining ventures would
be: (1) They would not have to incur any capital
expenditure in regard to steam engines or other prime
motive power; (2) they would receive their power
and pay for it by meter, exactly as if they were
urban factory owners; (3) they would not have to
face the heavy capital expenditure necessary for air
compressors, stamp batteries, mills and separa-
tion plant; (1) they would not have to incur heavy
expense in blasting out and levelling plant founda-
clations and treatment floors; (5) they would not
have to face the difficulties and heavy expenditure of
providing water-supply to their claims; (6) they
would not have to obtain any fuel; (7) they would
avoid the cost of haulage of heavy plant up to their
sites and its installation thereon; (8) they would
escape the cost of loading up and cartage (at least
10 miles) of their concentrates. Finally, they
wquld get their ore treated cheaper than they could
do it themselves.
The only plant the mining cos. would require
would be a rock-breaker and rock-drills. These
latter would be upon the electro-pneumatic principle,
which combines great economy with reliability. They
consume, indeed, only one-quarter of the power
required by air compressor and drills; and, as no
other motive power—beyond that for the rock-breaker
—would be required on the claims the cost to the
cos. would be but a small fraction of what they have
to incur under present conditions.
The advantages accruing to the centralised
treatment plant are too technical to be
touched upon here. As regards general
economy, however, Mr. Sennett points out;
(a) that the total motive power required
over the district would be very much less
than if steam-air compression and separate
crushing and treatment plants were dotted
over it; (b) the centralised power could be
generated at one-sixth of the cost of that of
individual units; (c) the cost of fuel would
not exceed about one-twelfth; and (d)
the capital outlay Would not exceed one-half.
Mr. Sennett also emphasises the fact that in
his suggested co-operative scheme he advo-
cates- only the employment of system and
plant which have proved thoroughly success-
ful and highly efficient under identical condi-
tions in other parts of the world.
Occidental, Cobar (N.S.W.-), after about
25 years’ run, put off all hands.the other
day and sent out S.O.S. signals to the share-
holders. After a couple of meetings in Syd-
ney and Cobar it was decided to approach
the Government and ask for a loan of
£lO,OOO. It is a pity the directors didn’t
consider it worth while to have a report on
the property by an expert handy, so that
shareholders could get a grip of the position
and what course would be advisable to
follow iu future. It is also up to the share-
holders to wake up after their long sleep and
keep their eyes open. Considerably more
than the £lO,OOO is needed to give the mine
any sort of a fair chance. There is still,
about £9OOO of uncalled capital on the “new”
issue of shares, and if this cannot he got in,
what’s wrong with forfeiting them and giv-
ing someone else a chance? The Mines
Department is at present engaged running
the rule over the property and making sure
that it can get some security for the £lO.OOO
it is asked to advance.

Adelong Creek (N.S.W.) has gone off the
dividend list for six months without a creak
in its old timbers. Out of the tail race it
washed £11,450 of gold, or just £3OOO less
than in the previous term. The trouble has
been with No. 2 dredge, which for its six-
months’ campaign ran up a debit of £l5O.
No. 1 started badly, but from February
on carried the whole show, and by netting
£3OOO helped to pay board fees, salaries and
interest, as well as giving a trifle of £lBB7
to prop up the appropriation account till the
other plant mends its ways. The unvar-
nished truth is that the Adelong Creek flats
are patchy. Roughly, it takes 930 z. to cover
all the Creek’s expenses. This compares with
114 oz. as recorded by the Estates next door.
What hits up costs is the price of stores and
steel. Dredging items (pure and simple, as
J. L. Wharton told a meeting of shareholders
the other day. haven’t varied much : but re-
pairs and renewals, instead of representing
only 25 p.e. of the total dredge outgoings, now
stand for a full 50 p.e. With the Adelong
Creek, dredging in six months absorbed
£371!). against £4324 required for renewals
and maintenance. Three years ago the ratio
of the one item to tin- other was exactly
reversed.
When the Kampong ivamunting (F.M.S.)
started work over two years ago it was esti-
mated that the property would be worked
out in 10 years. However, three, small areas
aggregating 48 acres had been added to the
end of last year, and arrangements were
recently made to lease a further 126 acres
from the Government. This ground is some-
what shallower and poorer than the average,
and though it' has not been close prospected
it is known to be payable. The co. can now
see at least 11 years’ work ahead. Net pro-
fit last half-year was £33,929. I’aid capital
is £140.000 in £1 shares, and to the end of
December last 12s. 6d. per share had been
paid in dividends and the Board reckoned
on being able to hand out 2s. quarterly this
year. Reserves of £33,250 have now been
accumulated, all of which is invested in War
Loan.
The White Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W
is feeding its battery with ore from the open
cut and the deposit of kaolin ore at the 50ft.
level. Meanwhile development work is being-
done at Stackpool’s shaft. The recent, revi-
val at the Carpathia should encourage the
Crystal to prospect further. When tin was
first discovered on this field, it was the rich
little pipe in the Crystal lease that: caused so
much excitement.
Baker’s Creek, Hillgrove (N.8.W.), has
experienced a market slump in Melbourne
mainly because of the unsatisfactory pro-
spects in opening up the No. 18 level, where
the drive is carrying a reef 4ft. wide of low
value. The reef in the south winze below
No. 17 level shows Sin. of stone worth 3oz.
of gold per ton. The north winze is down
51ft. on Sin. of stone, assaying 20dwt. With
regard to the south winze below No. 17 level
the width of the reef at a depth of 13ft. was
Bin. and tli.e value 50z., and good values con-
tinued down to 03ft. However the reef
showing in Nos. 15 and 10 levels is looking
rather poor at present.
Stuckey’s June yield of £5552 from 900
tons at Edna Deeps (W.A.) was a nasty
knock to the spec, sellers in three big inter-
state markets. The screw was promptly
applied for scrip, but the eel-like specker
wriggled round with clearing-house slips and
saved his skin. If Stuckey can repeat this
performance once or twice rumors of changed
management will be swept out of sight. No
love is lost between the grumbling Adelaide
crowd which holds Deeps in blocks and the
little herd of brokers that trail all hours of
the day over Alec Peacock’s well-worn door-
mat to pick up every crumb of news. The
trouble at Deeps is not to pitch out one or
two good crushings, but to discount the yarn
that the shoot of good stone in the Edna
lode has shortened so substantially as to put
ore reserves low on the list.
* * * *
After listening for two days to the evi-
dence in the Westonia water case, the
Warden decided to take time, to decide
whether Edna May Consolidated owed Edna
May anything for the drainage of the ore
channel on which the mines of the two
cos. are situated. State Mining-Engineer
Montgomery, manager Giblin of the Central,
and others reckoned that the Edna May had
drained the Consolidated to a substantial
extent; mine-inspector Crabb did not think
it had down to 250 ft., while Aldridge was
positive that there was no connection between
the ore bodies in the two mines and that
Edna May pumps did not draw any water
from the Consolidated at all,
Westralia’s gold yield for the half-year to
June was, roughly, 50,000 fine oz. short of
the figures for the same period of 1917, and
nearly ISO.OOOoz. below the total for the first
six months after the war started. The bulk
of the State’s present output is being fur-
nished by a few big mines, which but for the
immense sums —millions in some instances —
expended on plant equipment and develop-
ment could not be worked to-day. Most of
these are slowly dying, and when they pass
away Heaven only knows what will happen
to the Westralian gold industry. There is
a lot of talk about reviving it, but somehow
no one seems anxious to be up and doing.
The trouble is that there is nothing good
enough on hand to attract outside capital to
any extent, and local investors have been
had so often that they refuse to try again.
During the first six months of 1895, when
Coolgardie was at its zenith, 73 Westralian
cos. were floated in London with subscribed
capitals aggregating nearly £lOO,OOO, while
scores of mines and delusions were placed
on the local markets during the same period.
Towards the end of that year the flotations
increased phenomenally, and by the begin-
ning of 1890 the money subscribed in Eng-
land exceeded £50.000,000.
.Mararoa's purchase of the Light of Asia,
at Cue ( W.A.), is now declared to be depen-
dent only on the Federal Treasurer’s
approval. Meanwhile the vendors are making
preparations for a final clean-up in expecta-
tion of such approval being obtained. A
partial clean-up at the end of last month
yielded OOloz. of gold from ore at 300 ft.,
which is the deepest point yet worked on the
field.
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) does not in-
tend to put up the shutters just yet. There
are, it appears, some 220,000 tons of broken
ore lying loose underground, and out of this
the co. expects to do fairly well. Meantime
more blocks, are being marked out for tribu-
tors, and if anything substantial is found
the eo.’s liquidator may decide to carry on
indefinitely.
Another rich pocket has just been un-
earthed at Boogardie, near Magnet (W.A.),
a party of three getting OOloz. of gold from
a few cwt. of stone. Two of the present
holders took a lot of gold out of this ground
some years ago and then left. Another
prospector next dug a small fortune out of
it and nassed it on to a mate who- also did
well. Then the original owners returned to
the show, with the result mentioned above.
From the State mining-registrar at Mount
Magnet (W.A.)
Tub BiTtLKTiK’s remarks (6/6/'18) on Payne’s
Kind are somewhat misleading. It doubtless was
referring to the eo. known as “The Payne’s Find
Development C 0.,” which, as it rightly says, ha's
nearly 'petered out, although it is still worked by
tvibutors with more or less success. But Payne’s
Find, as a centre, is quite flourishing; there being-
some highly payable shows worked'by small parties,
and values are increasing with depth. The May
return was 766 fine oz. from 458 tons, all put through
the Government battery.
The shock of a 7dwt. yield instead of an
oz. brought Daylesford School of Mines expert
F. C. Stephens into the Rising Star Ex-
tended *( Vie.) stopes. His sampling of the
shoot of gold from end to end is 30dwt., so
the intention is to see if the make lives to
the south. If it does the co. will crush at
home, when, no doubt, it will take fine care
that the mullock is picked out before the
battery is reached. The co. has about 3000 ft.
on the Rising Star and Ajax lines, and is
driving east and west 300 ft. at No. 2 level
to try to pick up a run of gold on either of
those reefs. Needless to say Daylesford
isn't running any risks by backing the show,
although a lot of gold was got by the old
timers out of the Rising Star line. All the
enthusiasm that keeps the Rising Star on
the market is in George Anderson’s office.
Cheap power has brought another industry
to the Speck. Launceston hopes soon to be
turning out the 12,000 tons or so of white
lead that Australia used to import every
year. James Gitsham, managing director of
a British syndicate, has entered into a con-
tract for 400 electric horse-power from the
Launceston Corporation for a start, and in-
tends to take up 1000 h.p. later from the
State’s hydro-electric works if all goes well.
He claims that by his patent process a ton
of galena can be turned into 24cwt. of white
lead, the added weight being made up of oxy-
gen absorbed from the atmosphere. Plant is on
its way to Australia and production will
probably be commenced before tin; end of
til*; year. For a start ore supplies will be
drawn solely from Tas., but as production
increases Gitsham may have to go farther
afield.
It is about 20 years since the Lefroy, once
the Speck’s most profitable gold-field, pro-
duced anything worth while. No co. is
working, but a few prospectors and old-age
pensioners potter about the ground. How-
ever. a bit of a flutter was caused in Laun-
ceston the other day by a few specimens
carrying good gold from a small reef which
had been traced some distance by one party.
The show is north-west of the Old Chums,
and runs-through what in the old days was
a payable zone. The trouble with tlie field
was that the pay-zone was short and cut
clean out at 400 ft.
Despite the shortage of water New Ruby
Flat, Bradshaw Creek (Tas.). paid its way
last half-year. The ground sluiced washed
out at about o.Blb. tin oxide per cub. yard,
and with a few acres of new ground ahead
divs. ought to show up during the current
half-year.
Adelaide speculators who have stuck to
Stannary Hills (Q.) so long seem likely to
recover some of their capital from what has
hitherto proved rather a disappointing ven-
ture. The Rocky Bluffs mill is now using
15-lid. of stamps to crush low-grade ore from
the Arbouin open cut. and there appears to
be plenty of crushing stuff available!

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Better than calomel, oil or pills to
clean and regulate liver,
bowels and stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night, and in the
morning all the foul, constipated waste, sour
bile and fermenting food delayed in the
bowels gently moves out of the system. When
you awaken all headache, indigestion, sour-
ness, foul taste, bad breath, fever and dizzi-
ness are gone; your stomach is sweet, liver
and bowels clean, and you feel grand.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
family laxative. Everyone from grandpa to
baby can safely take it, and no one is ever
disappointed in its pleasant action. Millions
of mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, sick, feverish children. Ask
your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”—Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs—which has directions
for babies, children of all ages, and for
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Remember,
imitations are sometimes substituted, so lo,ok
and see that your bottle bears the name of
California Fig Syrup Company. Hand back
with contempt any other fig syrup. “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—is sold by all
chemists in bottles of two sizes. Is. lAd. and

Australia has won 38 Victoria Crosses in
this war. Those gained outside the
A.I.F. were those of Lieut. Wilbur Dartnell,
25th (Frontiersmen’s) Battalion, Royal
Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), in
East Africa; Major and Squadron Com-
mander Lance G. Hawker, D. 5.0., R.F.C.,
previously Royal Engineers, France; and
John Mayman, with Botha’s forces in Ger-
man East Africa. Dartnell and Mayman
were Victorian born, and Hawker came to
light in South Australia. Mayman is the
only one of the three not killed in action.
Of the 35 Y.C.’s gained in the ranks of the
A.1.F., the Seventh Battalion, a Victorian
unit, holds pride of place with four—Burton,
Dunstan, Symons and Tubb —all won at.
Gallipoli. Taking into account the birth-
place of each V.C. winner, apart from the
unit of which he was a member, the record
runs ; Victoria, 10; N.S.W., 6 ; Tas., 5 ; Eng-
land, 5: M.L., 3; S.A.. 2; Ireland, 1; Den-

mark, 1; Queensland, 1; W.A., 1. If
Hawker, Dartnell and Mayman are included
Victoria’s quota is 12, and that of S.A. 3.
Taken by units, the score is: N. S. Wales,
11; Vic., 10; composite units, 7; S.A., 3;
Queensland, 2; W.A., 1; Tas., 1. Other than
A.1.F., 3. Twenty-six of the bronzes were
won in France, nine at Gallipoli, two in East
-Africa, and one in Egypt. Of the winners
35 have been killed in action or have died
of wounds, 16 are still on the job, six
have come home and one is permanently
in England. In addition to their V.C.’s
the gallant array musters a D.S.O. and Bar
and D.C.M. (Capt. H. W. Murray) ; a
D.S.O. (Hawker) ; three M.C.’s (Jacka,
Shout and Cherry) ; two D.C.M.’s other than
Murray’s (Jackson and Whittle) ; and two
M.M.’s (Birks and Howell). The wounds
of those who survive are numerous, Jacka
heading the list with four. The first Aus-
tralian (Victorian) V.C. was his. The first
native-born N. S. Wales soldier to gain the
award was Hamilton; the first Crow-eater,
Blackburn ; the first Bananalander, Carroll
(with a N.S.W. unit) ; the first Westralian,
Throssell (with a Victorian unit) ; and the
first Tasmanian, Murray, whose service was
with a composite Westralian and subse-
quently a. N. S. Wales battalion. The vari-
ous arms have participated as follows: In-
fantry, 31 V.C.’s; Flying Corps, 2; Machine

paper as the imperial family of Japan, which claims
to have held the dignity since Jimmu, 2678 years
ago. But the Jimmu family was kept alive at times
by adoption, while the Ottomans never adopted any-
thing except bad habits. After the custom of
Mohammed’s race, his brother and predecessor, Abdul
Hamid, kept him shut up in a palace for 33 years,
mostly without newspapers. He hadn’t much intellect
to start with and he finished with less. He began
to reign in 1909 by virtue of a Revolution. He lost
most of his European territories by one war. Another
took from him Tripoli, the last bit of Turkish
Africa. In a third (the present scrap) he lost
Palestine, his nominal suzerainty over Egypt;
Mecca, the centre of his religion, and the rest of
Turkish Arabia; also with the loss of Mecca and
the elevation of the Grand Shereef to be an hereditary '
monarch, he practically ceased to be a Commander
of the Faithful. In fact neither he nor any other
impostor of his family ever was Commander of the
Faithful, for the real personage must be an Arab
of a specified tribe, and the Turkoman sultans
couldn’t qualify. Mohammed V. was the Shadow of
God for nine years, and was very shadowy indeed.
He once travelled as far as Salonika, and his
dethroned predecessor and brother was dragged the
same distance; but that was the extent of their
journeyings. He never went to war; no sultan has
done that for a very long time. He was illegitimate
in a sense, like his predecessors; it is nearly three
centuries since the Shadows of God gave up the
form of marriage. Nobody said anything very bad
about him except that he was quite as superfluous
as he looked. Latterly hardly anybody said anything
about him at all. Hun agents and a virulent son-in-
law drove him along rocky paths which didn’t fit his
venerable feet. His epitaph reads: “Here Lies an
Ancient Person who Didn’t Signify.”
“F.T.”: General Gellibrand’s promotion
reminds me. In the drowsy years before the
war “Gelli” topped off his military education
by going through the British Staff College,
which qualified him for a staff appointment.
Staff pay was so miserable compared with
the swank to be kept up that the fine officer
slung in his commission and decided to grow
and sell apples instead. When the war began
he saw his chance and told the Defence De-
partment who and what he was, and that he
wanted to lend a hand. But the fatuous
crowd told him there was nothing for him
to do, thank you. Fortunately he refused to
be cold-shouldered.
A record for a stay in the Public Service
of S. Aus. is claimed by Robertson, of the
Government Printing Office. He has had 58
years of it. He is 71 now, but he started
the job at an early age. His retirement
came last week. The veteran’s absence on
sick leave has not totalled a month in the
half-century.
Gone west from Forest Plain, Bananaland,
George Willett, pioneer of the Darling
Downs, aged 83. He landed at Moreton Bay
from England in ’44, and went shepherding
on the Richmond River and Acacia Greek.
He tried his luck for a time in Maoriland,
but not for long. Bananaland called him
back.
“0.K.” for the defence :
One of the most useful men in Britain, seemingly,
is Pemberton Billing, the enfant terrible of the
House of Commons, the prophet of the aeroplane
a 3 a decisive factor in the war. When he was
defendant in a notorious libel action, which was
merely a question of morality on the surface of it,
Billing fought till he had dragged in a reference to
the alien menace in Britain. Later,
when the House of Commons was dis-
cussing national service in a polite,
unimpassioned tone, Billing raised a
point of order re the non-internment
of “damned aliens,” and the expres-
sion “damned” as applied to aliens
was so shocking to the House that
the Speaker ordered him to withdraw
the insult; but Billing still went on
“damning.” Bonar Law moved the
suspension of the disgraceful mem-
ber, yet the outspoken rebel stuck to
his “damned” position until he was
frog-marched out of the sacred hall of
respectability. The audience cheered,
and the members with alien social
and commercial connections no doubt
cheered loudest. The violent ejection
of Billing for what practically was
his demand for more internment of
“damned aliens” happened on Mon-
day night of last week. Next day
came news of the Hun sinking of
another hospital ship under atrocious
circumstances. The same Tuesday
representatives of London councils
passed a resolution urging the Gov-
ernment to intern all enemy aliens
and all naturalised subjects born in
enemy countries; also Lord Beresford
gave notice of a question on the alien
subject in the House of Lords, which
question was postponed for a week
in accordance with the grand old
cursed policy of “wait-and-see.” So it seems that
the damned feelings of Billing re the internment of
aliens on the Monday night were the feelings of
the whole damned country.

begin to roll. The civil occupations of Aus-
tralia’s V.C.’s show that no one calling can

“Satan”: Amongst the many Australians
who have stepped out of the ruck is Major-
General T. W. Glasgow, C. 8., C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., a one-time resident of Gympie (Q.).
He enlisted in 1914 and departed as second-
in-command of the 2nd Light Horse Regi-
ment. On the Peninsula he succeeded
Lieut.-Colonel Rowell as commander at
Pope’s Post, where he earned the C.M.G.
Before leaving the Peninsula he commanded
his regiment and later, in Egypt, was
selected, although comparatively a junior, to
command the 13th Infantry Brigade. Ilis
chief characteristic, a combination of tenacity
and dash, he imparted to his brigade, and its
sterling work brought him the C.B. As a
further reward for his work he has been
selected to command a division.

“An Old Bird”: When Capt. (now Major)
Harry Petre was in charge at Point Cook
(Vic.) he had with him Lieut, (now honor-
ary major) Eric Harrison. Petre was
brought to Australia to organise and to be
O.C. of its first flying school, and Harri-
son came as assistant instructor and
oflieer in charge of the workshdps. The
former is one of three, brothers who were
all good fliers. Petre “the Monk” (Harry)
and Petre “the Hermit” (who was killed
in a cross-country flight in England before
the Kaiser started out on his kultur crusade)
were names to conjure with in the early
days when we flew for Daily Mail prizes
and not for a guinea a day with Archie bat-
teries thrown in as a special inducement to
the blas6 birdman. The youngest brother
was with the R.N.A.S. at the Dardanelles.
Passed out in New York on April 15, two
days after the publication of his book, “Over
There with the Australians,” Captain R.
Hugh Ivnyvett. of the A.I.F. He graduated
from Sydney University, but soon forsook the
studious life to become a pearl fisher. When
the call to arms reached him he joined up as
a private, became a scout on Gallipoli and
later an intelligence officer on the Western
Front. He was severely wounded while
scouting behind the German second line, and
was invalided home. As soon as he could
walk he set sail for the U.S. and, while wait-
ing for health to return, he wrote his book
and lectured to hundreds of thousands.
Teddy Roosevelt, whose praise is not
lightly given, said of him : “Captain Ivnyvett
was not only a most gallant soldier and most
powerful and convincing speaker, but also a
singularly high-minded idealist. Rarely have
I been so impressed by any man I had seen
for so short a time.” Ivnyvett collapsed and
died while delivering a lecture in New York.

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is a PARADISE to the EYES
LADIES! Think how many years older your
face looks than skin that is unexposed. Yet the
world judges you by your face, and with the wastage
of manhood caused by war and your growing import-
ance, the world will become more critical. How
unfair then to yourself not to counteract the ill
effects of wind and weather, dust and grime—after
surfing, touring,- motoring or a busy day at home —-to
have tiie clear, youthful, healthy and attractive skin
that is rightfully yours.
ft is so easy to acquire this by care and attention.
The removal of this hidden dirt and grime takes
with it the shine and oiliness, the drawn weary
expression, and by perseverance youthful cheeks smile
back at you, and all declare “how well you look.”
Refuse to grow old when it can be avoided. Why
cast envious eyes at another when all you need to
do, to have an equally enviable complexion, is to
pay attention to and care for your skin? Be comely
even if not beautiful.
In Modern »Uin Uysieina the aim is to cleanse and
improve the texture of the skin, develop and bring
out its latent beauty, rather than gloss over its
imperfections.
John Strange Winter’s toilet preparations offer the
modern creams, etc., for this purpose.
They are entirely free from any pastiness, and
contain not a particle of grease. They are harmless
to the skin of the merest babe. They are so dewy,
so delicate.
They are used by Royalty, a sufficient guarantee
for you.
They have won six Gold Medals at London, Parts,
Rome.
Ask for them at the Civil Service, Farmer's,
David Jones’s, Lassetter's, Washington H. Soul’s,
W. T. Waters’, Horderns’, McCathie’s, all chemists,
etc., etc.

THE COLD SHOULDER.
“It's rather chilly, love. Hadn't you better
have something more on?”
“Perhaps I had. Suppose you run upstairs
and get my pearl necklace.”
“Sapper” lodges a complaint:—
As it is persistently advertised in the Palestine
News that the Y.M.C.A. exists to serve the men —
underlining- the words “men” and “serve,” I and
many others would be glad to know how the state-
ment can be reconciled with the following, which
is irrefutable. On Dec. 29 last, together with nine
other men, I travelled from ICantara, our destina-
tion being Esdud. We arrived at Deir Sineid about
9 a.m. on the next day,/ and were, naturally, in
need of a cup of tea. Though sceptical, through
previous experience, we made our way to the Y.M.,
but could only get a cake or some biscuits. How-
ever, beside the big tent was a smaller one, sporting
the red triangle and the sign “Officers’ Rest Camp.’
In this haven not only were the favored few served
with tea, cocoa, etc., but a meal was also provided.
We were naturally disgusted and, seeing tw T o hefty
young Australian Y.M. reps., I asked them why it
was the rank and file could not, at least, get a cup
of something hot. My query was put courteously,
but these young gentlemen were extremely fresh
and informed me that sufficient water was not avail-
able to serve everybody. Six weeks later the
same conditions prevailed and probably still pre-
vail. At the Khan Yunus Y.M. from the April
stunt until October it w-as the same, although on
very rare occasions one might chance a cup of tea
from the cook. No shortage of water could be
advanced as a reason for preferential treatment,
there. Bjven in a standing camp like Moascar, the
refreshment section could not be more unattractive.
A piastre is charged for a tin mug—filthy in appear-
ance—of brown, under-milked slush called cocoa.
Another half-piastre for a “rock-cake” (very true to
name), total 3jd., which more than covers the cost.
Seeing how many thousands have been subscribed in
Australia alone for operating expenses, it should be
possible to get a decent drink and feed for a decent
price. (We are better pleased to pay for a thing
than have it free.) One can have nothing but
admiration for the Port Said, Cairo and Alexandria
depots.
“Machete” : Stories of old-time Queensland
Judges (B. 27/6/’I8) recall .the fact that
on whole circuits of those bygone days jus-
tice was wont to be tempered with whisky.
Particularly was this the case on the
Northern circuit, when the Court had to
steer its way to such thirsty quarters as
Cairns, Cooktown and Thursday Island, to
say nothing of Normanton and Burketown.
One venerable Judge of my acquaintance
was once hurriedly awakened from an after-
lunch nap and hustled off to the northern
boat. He had unbraced himself before
going to sleep and the fact was not noticed
when he was shoved into a cab. As he
ambled on to the wharf, however, his trousers
fell down about bis feet and S’onah fell on
his nose. Picking himself up, he adjusted
his garments in the face of a large and inter-
ested audience and clambered on board. The
time when a sheriff was run over by an alli-
gator on the Cairns Esplanade was also
memorable, though it occurred somewhat
later.
Those people who desire “peace by negoti-
ation” with the Hun had the way cleared
for them last week when an influential Hun
politician announced the lowest terms on
which his tribe would negotiate. They in-
elude the surrender of the
British navy, of a great part of
Belgium and France, including
Calais, of the lost colonies, of
Egypt, Gibraltar, Servia and
Montenegro and £9,000,000,0(X)
indemnity. There are three
fairly solvent Allies left, but
France wouldn’t be solvent
after such a settlement, so
Britain and the U.S. would
have to divide the bill between
the m/ Setting down the
British Empire’s share at
£4,500,000,000 and writing off
most of the nigger peoples as
quite hopeless in a financial
sense, Australia’s end of the
indemnity would be about
£200.000,000 or £300,000,000.
and it would have to pay. One
reason why France wouldn’t be
able to shoulder its bit is that
it is to be occupied by a Hun
army till the invoice is cleared
off and is to pay that army. So
it would be busy quite apart
from the indemnity. The de-
tails are to be settled after the
Huns occupy Paris. This re-
calls a legend 2000 years old.
Crassus invaded Parthia with a
great Roman army, and a
Parthian general (possibly
named Foch) was sent to speak
about peace by negotiation.
Crassus said coldly that he
would explain his . terms at
Selencia, and the Foch of 2000
years ago is alleged to have held
out his hand palm upwards and said. “Hair
shall grow here before you see Selencia.”
Crassus and the bulk of his army didn’t
even get Christian burial —in fact they
couldn’t, because Christianity wasn’t on
the books, then.

A cable to Australia (6/7/’18) reported
the death of the Sultan of Turkey. This
removes any doubt about the efficacy of
prayer.

The Commonwealth’s third wooden
steamer has been launched —not on the pre-
mises of course, but in the U.S. at our
expense. Some two years ago Hughes, the
man who always sees things after they hap-
pen, announced that there was no intention

“Well, I find that they are not in such a.hurry to leave me to do the job myself .”
to build wooden ships ; but perhaps he only
meant that there was no intention to build
them here. This habit of hiring people to
do things for us almost suggests the luxuri-
ous ways of the brilliant French nobleman
of the boom days before the breakage days,
who had three large employees to bring him
his chocolate while he lay in bed.
* -* * *
The natural dishonesty of the Hun when
he talks humanitarianism is endorsed by
Captain MacNamara, of the A.F.C. in Pales-
tine. The Huns having established an
aerodrome in a desert town, the Australians
started bombing it., whereupon the harassed
Souareheads dropped messages protesting
that “our poor dear women” were being-
slaughtered by this ruthlessness. The Aus-
tralians replied with a promise to keep quiet
for a week whilst the aerodrome was being-
shifted from the town to a place where no
non-combatants could possibly suffer. Seven
days later the Huns had fixed up a bogus
aerodrome in a distant field, while their head-
quarters remained in the town as before.
The Huns, without a thought for the safety
of anyone but themselves, were imposing upon
the Australians’ sense of fair play. In fight-
ing such an enemy it is necessary to —well,
it’s necessary to bog in !
THE TIME LIMIT.
“I say — er—how do yon think -a fellah
should propose — er — nowadays?"
“Oh — er—just nowadays .”
For nearly live years the mad Kaiser has
been spreading his legions of death over the
face of the earth seeking whom he may
devour, and the Federal Govt, has just woke
up to the fact that it has been providing
comfortable jobs for G 55 possible spies of
“enemy origin.” The Commissioner who has
been making inquiries discovered that these
men are employed in the Post. Telegraph.
Telephone and Nary departments! Of
course, we’ll alter all that sort of thing—
after the war, when we have more time.
“Demos”: The Law never pays for its
own mistakes, as a young man at Port
Cygnet (Tas.) discovered with great sud-
denness the other day. During the course
of an argument with a large butcher he
“stopped one.” The smitten party sought
satisfaction in the law court and the butcher
was fined; but the meat-man’s lawyer dis-
covered that the information omitted to
state the locality of/the assault. As the
summons contained full particulars in all
other respects, the magistrates thought it
only fail* to brush aside the technicality.
Bur the Supreme Court took another view,
quashed the conviction, and ordered the un-
fortunate young man who had been punched
heartily to pay all the costs. That’s the
way to encourage citizens not to break the
peace.
* * * *
. Josiali Symon, K.C.. surprised the Jus-
tices’ Association in Adelaide the other day
by recallihg the fact that the Courts did not
worry about horsehair on the heads of the
Bar in the early days. He himself had
been admitted to the Supreme Court for five
years before this unnecessary form of camou-
flage came in. Incidentally Symon made a
strong protest against any idea of doing with-
out a jury in criminal cases. It would be a
“lamentable day,” he said, when such a
change was made. In all Symon’s legal
equipment, vast as it is, the knack of work-
ing on the feelings of a jury is perhaps his
most valuable asset; so the plea was liable to
be misconstrued by people who don’t know
the K.C.

And haggard winter icy-bound ;

Above a cowed and broken foe!

For noble manhood reft away.

past. In nine cases out of ten the “agent”
if engaged in the merry business of spolia-
tion, and there is over them all a weird sug-
gestion of the vultures that gather where the
dead men lie, each eager to get away with
his craw full before someone comes with a
gun. War conditions have produced the
new’ brood, and for the time being they are
exploiting the people’s heeds without' hin-
drance and with unblushing voracity. It’s a
long lane that has no turning, and Flinders-
lane is not very long.

“Drofsed” : This is how it’s done. Some
time ago, when the Central Flying School
(Pt. Cook, Vic.) boasted of a seaplane the
Dept, of Expense set to work to build a jetty
and a rail track thereon to lead the way
to the water. After the job had been
passed and the contractors had packed away 1
tlieir tools, pocketed the cheque and gone
home somebody discovered that the sea
wasn’t deep enough at low tide for launching
the olane, so another contract was let to

push the jetty a bit further out. Then
everything was ready—except the seaplane,
which had, in the meantime, been converted
into a landplane.
Newbolt, in the March issue of Tiie Field,
published a poem entitled “A Chanty of the
Emden, ’ in which this verse appears:—
The Sydney and the Emden
They went it shovel and tongs,
The Emden had her rights to prove,
The Sydney had her wrongs.
The Sydney had her wrongs, my lads,
And a crew of South Sea Blues;
Their hearts were hot, and as they shot
They sang like kangaroos.
Of course, what he meant was jaekeroos-
the animals that warble on the Freetrade
tree.
“Briner”: The wreck of the John Murray,
formerly the Loch Ryan, deepens an old con-
viction of mine that there was some defect
in the Loch line of 30 or 40 years ago. It
had such unparalleled ill-luck. Finally, it
passed out of existence. The Loch Ard
piled up at Port Campbell (Vic.), and the
only persons saved were Tom Pearce and
Eva Carmichael. The Loch Sloy was lost
on King Island. The Loch* Maree left Gee-
long and was never again heard of. Several
others met with the same fate. The Loch
Katrine, dismasted between Melbourne and
Sydney, is now a hulk in Port Jackson. The
Loch Tor ri don. sold to Russians, was
wrecked. The line was owned by Aitken,
Lilburn and Co., Glasgow.

The Inter-State Commission, now sitting
in Sydney, spent most of last week ques-
tioning tailors. The president of the
Master Tailors’ Ass. slipped the cat when
he said that some firms rushed a suit through
a factory for 255. and shoved it on to cus-
tomers as a hand-made, first-grade article at
eight guineas. Provided, he said, a tailor
paid wages according to the Arbitration
Court’s award, he could put as litile work
into a suit as he liked and sell it at a high
price. A man getting one of these factory-
made suits would discover what had come to
him within three weeks. One tailor in a b g
way of business said he would welcome a
compulsory marking of his suits as hand-
made or factory-made. Tailoring seems to
be*a payable trade since fig-leaves went out
of fashion.
Reflecting on the casualness of the North
Sydney railway trains it was as far back as
1885 or 1886 that Henry Parlies decided,
with the enthusiastic concurrence of a lot
of people who lived in the North Shore dis-
trict, that there should be rotten engines ou
that line in 191 S and years thereabouts. In
other words, he decided definitely for what he
called Freetrade. So N.S.W. didn’t learn
to make its own locomotives, except in the
sense of nailing together imported parts, and
now imported locomotives and the imported
parts are both practically unprocurable. In
the old days the Protectionist, who foretold
what would happen by reason of this abject
dependence on imports, was treated by the
Freetrader whose train is now stuck behind
the scarce and worn-out engine on the North
Shore line as a sort of lunatic or freak. So
the Freetrader is getting what he asked for,
and if his engine becomes twice as crippled
and only half as numerous, he will be getting
less than he deserves.

There is no limit to the meanness of some of
them. A regulation under the Soldiers’ Settle-
ment Act (N.S.W.) provides that land-
owners submitting their bit of the earth
for sale to the Department must deposit
£5 to cover cost of inspection. Recently
Minister for Lands
Ashford, who is run-
ning this end of the
repatriation scheme,
announced that it had
been discovered tha,t
some landowners had
made the soldiers part
up this £5 to the De-
partment, instead of
doing so themselves,
which is one way of
showing sympathy for
the returned Billjim.
Ashford has announced
that not only will
there be strict scrutiny
in the future to pre-
vent this sort of vil-
lainy, but he has also
undertaken that where
Billjim can show that
he has been thus
squeezed the Depart-
ment will return the
deposit and set out to
,V' , , , recover the same from
the land-shark. If a solid penalty
under the W.P. Act could be heaped
on as well, the tidings thereof would
be refreshing.

Determined to make the acquaintance of
death, Richard Garrard, of Melbourne,
showed some ingenuity in obtaining an intro-
duction. Not having a gun, he fixed, a cart-
ridge in a piece of brass tubing, placed the
tube to his breast, held an awl against the cap
of the cartridge, and struck the awl with a
hammer. Then Richard’s labors were qt an
end.

The strike among the Methodists of
Brompton (an Adelaide suburb) has broken,
out afresh ; only it is more like a lock-out this
time. The Methodies are stronger in S.A.
than in any other State, and their ruling
body has now forbidden all preaching to
parson Morris, on whose mere transfer to
another district the Bromptonians formerly
downed hymn-books. The Synod, sitting in
judgment on him, says that he has been
‘‘blasphemous.” He admits having said that
ic treated him as the Pharisees treated
Christ. Synod is also annoyed with him for
having accused it of bias. As to that, he
assures the Adelaide dailies:—
Time after time, for periods of four and six
hours, I had to engage six or seven ministers in
intense mental conflict, badgering and wrangling.
Could any man be absolutely calm under this “third
degree”? At a previous trial the Rev. J. Roonev
said : “I thank God I have no son like you.” Rev. W. A.
Ijungsford said: “I would rather appear as a witness
against you than act as a judge.” On leaving
Synod, I remarked: “Gentlemen, whatever you do,
do it quickly.” The Rev. P. Bullock then said: “We
will keep you on toast as long as we can.” And yet
I am suspended for charging them with bias!
The Brompton followers have declared that
they will not enter a Methodist church again
until their man is righted. Meanwhile he
holds services in the local Town Hall, and
the onlooking heathen are filled with joy.
“The Oldest Inhabitant'’ wheels in some
more pubs:—
The City Bank buildings (erected since the fire
of 1890 destroyed the fine building on the corner of
Moore and Pitt streets, Sydney) are to be “hammered.”
Like most other good sites in the city this one once
supported a pub.
Near the spot, if not
actually on it,
George Coppin kept
the Clown Tavern.
In the first half of
the ’seventies the
locality was notori-
ous. Side by side
with the Shakspeare
Tavern stood a night
house, the Prince
Albert Hotel and
Restaurant, r u n
ostensibly by Bob
Horne, but really
managed by his
wife. Its doors were
never closed. The
Shakspeare at one
time was kept by
Thos. Spencer, a
clever mechanic. He
subsequently opened
a mechanical show a
few doors south. A
late occupant of the
Shakspeare was Miss
Polly Smith, who
married H. L. Rob-
erts, a Treasury
clerk. Mrs. Roberts
is still living. Com-
pagnoni, the confec-
tioner, was next door
to the Shakspeare, and
Lister, auctioneer,
next door to him. It

F.N.T.”: With a choice between mice in
the Malice and weevils at the wharf, David
Oman, "V ic. Minister for Wheatstacks, has
agreed with the Wheat Commission and the
Railways Department that in future Vic-
torian grain shall'be stored in the bush
until such times as ships may be ready for
taking it away. Most grain-handlers know
that weevils love moisture, mainly thriving
in. stacks which the sea-air can reach, so
this decision might have been arrived at
without the advice of an imported professor
of weevils. Anyhow, probably the whole of
next season’s wheat will be assembled in two
or three immense storages, mouse-proofed as
far as possible, until something is done about
siloing the lot, pending its despatch abroad
later this century, or the following fortnight.
THE HAPPY VIEWPOINT.

POLITICAL

A stray item :
Mr Holman said that an economy campaign had
,oeen launched in N. S. Wales. The persons who ad
initiated it desired the Usher of the Black Rod to
he abolished, and they declared that there was a
tofLnt S ,™t onel ’ y an T d that tho Government had
J motor-cars. It was remarkable that thev
. Tw el -^n e neW Calpet put down in th e Assem-
1■ • these items were a mere bagatelle.

telle taken separately, but when you add
enough bagatelles together you get a revolu-

Defence Minister Pearce’s accusation that
tne Bananaland Government, by getting a
surplus of_ £7OOO out of the State meat
shop is "profiteering” happens to be one
which cannot be brought against Pearce in
any form. But by the Great Lone Gum it
would be good business if Ryan could pro-
duce a schedule of the profit-mongering per-
petrated under Pearce’s own nose!
An explanation made by Acting Prime
Minister Watt the other day that he did not
mean what he had previously said about
merging the ’l5-16 wheat pool into the other
pools showed only that William was about
the last to notice that he had been talking
through his hat. Obviously the holders of
scrip are entitled to a specific statement
about each separate deal. It would have
been much more interesting and relevant if
Watt had explained how it came about that
belated instructions came to be issued for
paying an additional 3d. per bushel on
account of “hard wheat.” For instance, when
was it decided to make this payment? Does
the , actual grower get this 3d. or does the
individual who came in as an “investor”
irrespective of whether the wheat was tough
.or otherwise? Furthermore, is Watt, or
siuyone. able to state whether any extra pay-
ments have been made on this account, anil,
if so, how much has gone to Cocky and how
much to the other dealer?
Advices from England say that Prime
Minister Hughes’s health has greatly im-
proved. Hughes was always a sketchy mor-
tal, who even complained occasionally' about
the soup being tough ; but like other’ ghostly
figures he has vitality and may live to a
v great age. Some ghosts are so thin that
sfiup would fall right through them: yet
they' last a long time.
In the financial year ’l6-17, the N. S.
Wales railways were worked at a loss of
£894,064. In a paper read by Chief Com-
missioner Fraser to Sydney Chamber of
Commerce was an array of figures showing
what would have happened if the fares,
freights and wages were the same as pre-
vailing in various other countries. From
this it transpires that if worked on German
conditions there would have been a gain of
£758,877, on Austrian £2.042,708, on French
£859,858. on Japanese £188,400, on Ameri-
can £758,877. It is not quite clear what the
point of all this arithmetic is. Seeing that
the wages and so on are different it all looks
a bit futile. The most impressive calcula-
tion is probably that referring to Austria.
Anyway the figures would appear to give
a Right Thinking individual some justifica-
tion for groaning that if we only did what
the Austrian does there wouldn’t be a hole
in the eashbox and Fraser would be
£2,042,708 ahead of it every year. But an
inspection of detail shows that the Austrian
gets his results by paying an average wage
of £7O instead of our £l6O. He charges more
for every mile he carries a passenger and
charges up to within .020 d. per mile for every
ton of freight. The only possible conclusion
from this is that low wages applied to N. 8.
Wales would give the public a service pain-
THE UNHOLY MOSES.
Count You Roon has issued the Twelve Commandments of Pan-Germanism.— Cable.
fully inferior to the one in existence. The
net result would be higher fares, goods car-
ried at a miscroscopically less rate, and
£2,042,708 in the Treasury instead of being
handled by the men who do the toil. It
hardly looks worth while. The circumstance
that if Austria paid the individual it now
gets for £7O a year the N. S. Wales average of
£l6O there would have been an Austrian
hiatus of £24,885,341, seems to be another
reason for thinking that the local worker
gets off the mark with tbe most expedition.
The Commonwealth balance-sheet for the
year ended on June 30 (omitting war loan) :
Revenue .. £30,396,833
Expenditure.. 34,897,291
£1,499,542
As there was a balance on hand from the
preceding year of £2,077,427 the current year
begins with an accumulation of that plus the
foregoing surplus, altogether £3,570,969.
Last year John Forrest got his surplus by
postponing certain payments in London.
This time Watt acquires a surplus by cut-
ting down expenditure on works by half and
paying two-thirds of the reduced bill with a
p.n. In the previous year £4,288,747 was
spent out of revenue on works. In the year
to June the expenditure was £2,601,274 —
£618,484 only coming out of income. If the
works had been paid for as before the sur-
plus on Watt’s document would be called
“deficit, £453.295.” It is a paper surplus as
it stands, but, on paper, the reserve is there
to come and go on. Watt will have to do a
lot of coming and going before he’s done
with the subject.
The name of W. M. Hughes doesn't seem
to be plastered on the hoardings in big
enough lettering. The San Francisco
Chronicle of May 14 had this: —
Hon. Sir Thomas Hughes, Premier of Australia,
arrived here to-day with a party of Australian
officials, en route to a war conference in London.
Have Hughes’s press-agents been torpedoed?
There happens to be one simple answer to
N. 8. Wales Governor Davidson’s allegation
that for Australians “to work 10 hours
a day. as the railway workers do in the
United States, would not be altogether un-
pleasant.” It is this: That the U.S. rail-
way workers do not work 10 hours a day.
They did. and found it so infernally un-
pleasant that a huge strike was organised
about a couple of years ago to get an eight-
hours’ day. It was a strike that would have
tied the whole transport system of the States
into a knot, but Woodrow Wilson settled
the business by a stroke of the presidential
pen, and eight hours became the regulation
working day over all American railways.
His Ex. Davidson ought to know a little
thing like that. Perhaps he is too busy to
read all the cables. By the way, how many
hours a day does he work?
“Trot” hands in some arithmetic
Apropos of the announcement by Hughes in London
about the significance to John Bull of foreign and
“within the Empire” trade. How many people
know what was happening before the war in N. S.
Wales? Well, among other things, exports to places
within the Empire were falling and to furrin’ lands
they were growing. And as a natural consequence

“. yo “ work it out on a centesimal basis you get
this: That in 1907 N. S. Wales sold 54.5 per cent.
of her exports within the Empire and 45.5 per cent,
to foreign countries. In 1913 the respective percentage
was 47.7 and 52.3. In 1907 Ma got 64 per cent, of
her imports within the Empire; in 1913 only 61 per
cent. Foreign imports rose from 36 to 39 per cent.
Hughes may be yelling in the right place, but it
doesn’t look like it. If there was any hope of doing
the same thing for Xi years longer, N. S. Wales
exports to foreigners would be double the volume
acquired by British countries, and J. Bull and Co.
would be supplying less than half the imports.
“Demos”: Bung in Tasmania is threat-
ened with total extinction. Premier Lee has
always been a battler for Cold Tea, and
now. apparently, has his Cabinet with him
in a proposal to take a total prohibition
Referendum on the same day as the next
general election (April, 1019). A small
section of the party led by Wliitsitt is
threatening to revolt if the Referendum Bill
materialises; hut as such a course would be
sure to hasten the election, it may be taken
as mere bluff. Meanwhile, Bung "is wonder-
ing whether to drown himself in a barrel of
beer and get it over.
The Public Teachers’ Union of S. Aus.
had to consider at its annual conference a
suggestion that it should be registered as an
industrial union. The general opinion was
against the proposal as tending to split the
body, which, as it was explained, includes
every shade of political opinion, Conservatives,
Liberals, Democrats, Labor and Sinn Fein.
The scheme was thrown overboard by a
more than two-to-one majority. It followed
that the conference was not in any mood
to accept an invitation from the “National”
party of S. Aus. for affiliating with it. The
P.T.U. merely remarked that the idea was
“horrible,” and let it go at that.
Twelve months ago the annual charge on
the Commonwealth for interest on war loan
and war pensions was £8,421,654. At the
end of June it had risen to £10,569,795.
This year the charge for interest will go
tip about £5,000,000: for pensions, by
£2,000.000. Repatriation may absorb an
additional million. All this means that tbe
items making up the £11,885,547 paid out
of revenue by the Commonwealth for charges
incidental to the war will this year tot
up to about £19,885,547 more or less.
Treasurer Watt has before him the job of
raising that much more revenue, or saving
it in another direction. Watt has not been
feeling very well lately, and the day after
the figures had been checked he fled from
Melbourne on a holiday.
The pro-Hun Ministry which has been
imposed on fallen Roumania demands, pre-
sumably by order, that the anti-Hun Minis-
ters who tried to save the country shall be
put on trial, which is probably a short cut
to execution. And the humble Bolsheviks in
ltussia have been commanded to disarm the
soldiers who are still making a fight for
independence, and hand them over to Ger-
many to be dealt with. It is a hard job to
be,the Hun’s minion or the Hun’s dog.
Premier Holman, defending his financial
muddles: “There is only one State under-
taking that can be considered as not paying.
. . . .Any undertakings that have not been
paying have been closed down.” That is to
■say the lost money has been written off.
But State Socialism consists in making pub-
lic enterprises pay, not in abandoning them
at the country’s expense because, owing to
muddled management, they don’t pay. Hol-
man would probably sum up a financial
crisis by saying: “All our existing banks are
sound except one ; the rest have burst.”
Prime, Minister Hughes, who travels with
a ‘ suite” and a portable press agency and
limelight apparatus, naturally gets a lot of
advertisement in Australian papers. Pro-
bably the glowing reports of his talkings in
England have good foundation. But Hughes
isn’t tbe brilliant orator that Alfred Deakin
was. Nevertheless, Hughes is a fine speaker,
and the war has given him a chance that
Deakin never had. In action Hughes is
a hesitating man like Deakin, but he lacks
the sincerity which was behind the Vic-
torian politician’s polish. Also he is utterly
without Deakin’s lovable qualities.
STRATEGY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The loss in advance is greater than in retreat.”

Though “he who fights and runs away
Will live to fight another day”
Has been repeated up and down
The earth since Greeks took Troja town,
We were not sure until this year,
Full of disaster, death and fear,
AVhat happened to the other bloke
Who, chased,through gun and battle smoke
The person who, disaster shunning-,
Side-stepped liis blow and kept on running.
But now we know beyond all doubt
AVhere victory joins hands with rout.
The foe who makes his bold advance
On Flanders mud or dust of France,
Dies twice as fast as one who runs
From the first challenge of the guns ;
And who dies most, whoe’er retreat,
Must suffer ultimate defeat.
therefore, the rallying word we find most
Useful is “Devil take the hindmost!”
Tis clear for all the world to see
The method of our strategy.
All that we need is lots of room
To lead the foeman to his doom.
If France were only twice as wide,
The whole affair we could decide
By one tremendous, long retreat
And make our victory complete.
But narrow is that ancient land
On which we make our splendid stand;
And if we fell back to the sea,
All strategists must quite agree,
No chance were left but to advance
With loss to us and loss to France.
For, in retreat, the foe would see
Us dying twice as fast as he;
And, being base, might keep on running
Until he reached Berlin by cunning.
In that case it would surely be
Hard to explain our strategy.

Silas Snell ’: An old inhabitant from
the blue hills tells inc how public attention was first
drawn to the special precocity of the gentleman who
now represents that locality in Parliament. “Chant
had gone under his house after a cat what was sup-
posed to have died there. He got down under by
pullin up a board in the passage and crowdin’
through. Chant was a very thin feller then, but he
had to fight his way down under, and when he come
to get out he dash well couldn’t. They tried to pull
him out and failed. Chant was under there seven
houis, everybody niakin’ all sorts of suggestions, and
at last we were preparin’ to lift the house off its
blocks, when up comes Bill. Bill looked at the case,
thought it over deliberate, and then he got Chant
out. How? He pulled up another board!” So,
amazed at Bill’s perspicacity, they put him into
Parliament!

“Bouragi”: It is perfectly true that a
man may be a decent fellow, even if he is a cannibal.
About the most moral, honest, dignified and good-
tempered community I know was man-eating up
to a couple of years before my arrival amongst them.
As a matter of fact they had eaten one of my pre-
decessors. They made no pretence of religious cere-
monial or rite, as many cannibal peoples do, nor
was the meat reserved for chiefs or dignitaries.
Everyone was welcome, though naturally the women
and children came in for the scraps. These people
carefully fattened their prisoners. Those who tried
to escape had their legs broken to discourage them.
This tribe is the Binandele, the most trustworthy
and courageous of all the tribes of Papua.

‘Hoe” : To be fatally unfriendly to
Indian wax scale, cover the attacked tree with hessian
or tarpaulin. Under the covering place a bowl con-
taining half a pint of sulphuric acid, and into it
tip 2oz. of cyanide. The fumes do the rest; but be
certain to keep out of the way of the fumes yourself
—that is, if you have any regard for yourself.

“Pick : “W.H.E.." who boasts (B.
30/5/’18) of having tamed an outlaw filly with hand-
massage and sweets, is apparently possessed of that
animal-magnetism that has distinguished other
tamers. On the South Coast (N.S.W.) I knew an
imbecile youth whose only claim to a crust was
that he could without difficulty catch a horse from
amongst a mob that anyone else would have to chase
for an hour. Where in
Australia has “W.H.E.”
found such inferior horse-
men that they starve their
colts into docility? Dur-
ing the mouthing period a
young horse must go unfed,
but the fault with breakers
is that as a rule they are
too anxious to try how the
youngster can buck to give
sufficient attention to
mouthing. As a result
many prads are hard to
steer. On Monaro, where
Everyman is a breaker, the
custom generally is to
catch a colt in the morn-
ing and go mustering or
dingo-chasing on him in
the afternoon. At Bega,
Harry Dibley, livery-stable
proprietor, for a wager
yarded four unhandled
colts on Saturday and
drove them in a four-in-
hand coach, with a load
up, to Tathra and back
next morning. Could
“W.H.E.” do that with
his hand-massage and
sugar? No real Austra-
lian wants to be unkind
to the cobber that carries
him through flood and forest, hut a vicious horse
that comes at you with face open and fore-feet beat-
ing tattoos on the atmosphere has to be shown
which is man and which is moke.

“F.T.7”: “Ornis’s” recent decision that
Bananaland’s wasps do not sting has evidently been
based on an intense study of the big blaok-and-yellow
mason wasps, which are friendly and sociable
enough to build their mud nests in your ear, if you
lie long enough and quiet enough on the pub veran-
dah. But, as “Leo Lear” points out, there are
others, and the further north you get the more
cantankerous and Hunlike the brutes become. Beside
the small varieties mentioned by “Leo” there is
a big red chap who inhabits the Central Bananaland
scrubs, building a big, cone-shaped nest which he
hangs from a tree branch, just where a mounted man
pelting through the timber on the wing of a mob of
cattle will butt it. Then the red-hot wasp and five
or six thousand fellow-ratepayers buzz out full of
bad language, and all interest in cattle vanishes as
far as horse and rider are concerned.
“H.W.T.”: One of the cockies who took
part in the recent great offensive in Melbourne
against the Federal Government’s price-fixing pro-
posals failed to make himself clearly understood at
the preliminary gathering in the Temperance Hall.
He was arguing that under existing conditions, by
the time a calf reached the tender age of five
months it had cost the cocky £5 to rear, but
Massey, Green, Watt and others would have him
receive only £4 for his enterprise. In support of
his argument he declared that at five months a calf
would drink 300 gallons of milk a day! After the
uproar had subsided he was too shaken to explain
that his figures represented the youngster’s total
consumption of juice from the time it first touched
the earth.
* * * *
“Pick’’: The little sandpiper, or dotteril,
in hand, appears conspicuous enough with his whitish
breast, black head, red beak and purple bronze
upper wings, but when standing among the water-
worn pebbles and shingle and the red-edged water-
weeds of the river beaches where he is usually found,
he is a marvel of deceptive coloring. His crouching
attitude, too, and a habit of nodding like a weed dis-
turbed by the wind, assist in the deception, and even
his cry resembles strangely the knocking of water-
rolled stones. The only way to find his nest, or
brood, is to hide somewhere about and watch him
return after he has decided you are gone. Like him-
self the eggs are most difficult to find, owing to
their color harmonising with the surroundings.
“Eddyson” : Tombs explained why he did
not cut the man down. “My place is kind of out of
the way ; so when this feller come up through the
timber, driviii’ a ole rattle-trap, I was naturally sur-
prised. The feller camped on my land, not more’n a
’underd yards from my house, ’n’ he tied his horse
up by the leg, ’n’ started diggin’ a ’ole. He >vas a
curious sort o’ bloke —wore a woman’s ’at with a
feather in it, ’n’ white kid gloves, ’n’ no boots.
I watched him a bit, not makin’ ’ead or tail of him,
’n’ when he finished diggin’ his hole, ’n’ hung his
billy in it, ’n’ then spiked a bit of bread on a stick,
’n’ got to toastin’ it at the hole, I thought p’raps I
better have a word with him. ‘ ’Elio!’ I sez. ‘ ’Elio,
Arthur!’ sez he. ‘Wrong agin,’ I sez, ‘me name’s
George.’ ‘Oh, don't mind me,’ he sez, pleasant
enough, ‘l’m mad. That’s why I wear a feather in
me ’at,’ lie sez. That took me back. ‘What is the
’ole for?’ I sez. ‘The ’ole is to boil my tea in,’
sez he. ‘Don’t you know the deeper you go the
’otter you get?’ ‘You’ll never boil no billy there,’
sez I. ‘lt don’t matter,’ he sez. ‘That's the advan-
tage of bein’ mad—things don’t miitter.’ ‘Look ’ere,’
I sez, Svhat sort of mad are you ?’ ‘Oh, various,’ he
INDIFFERENCE.
SAMARITAN: “Now, here you are, old chap,
this tram will take you home."
DRUNK: “Don' care if it puts me to bed as
well,”
sez. ‘Coz,’ sez I, ‘if you’re dangerous mad you can't
stay on my property. Are you killin’ mad?’ He
smiled. ‘I haven’t killed anyone as yet,’ sez he, ‘but
I may take a turn. If I do, you shall be first.
I promise you that, on my honor.’ I went away, but
I couldn’t work. I returned to him again. He was
sharpin’ a knife on a bit of wood. ‘How’s yeh
feelin’ now, mister?’ I sez. ‘Very well, thank you,
Arthur,’ sez he. He brought an axe out of the buggy,
then an ole gun, and began to load her with dirt.
‘About the killin’, sez I. ‘How are you on that
jest now?’ ‘Middlin’,’ he sez, ‘jest middlin’. Don’t
you be afraid, though—you’ll be first.’ I went up to
the house fidgeting for awhile, ’n’ when I goes to
him once more he’s diggin’ another ’ole. ‘What is
it?’ sez I. ‘lt’s a gravel’ sez he. ‘Jest as well to
have a grave. Any man’s liable to want a
grave. By the way, if I want you during the night,
what’s your telephone number?’ I went up to
the house, ’n’ loaded me gun, ’n’ locked the wife V
kiddie in the bedroom, ’n’ sat down ’n’ waited.
P’raps you never sat well on into the early mornin’
waiting for a maniac with an axe; If you ain’t, you
don’t know, that’s all. At two I went sneakin’ down
on the bloke, half-cracked meself with wonderin’
what in ’ell he was up to. He was ’angin’ by the
neck to a tree. He had just ’ung himself. I left,
him—l reckoned he was safest where he was. Then
the blessed coroner bullied the ’ead off me fer not
cuttin’ him down. Cut him down! ’Struth, was a
man never to have a wink of sleep? Sez I to the
coroner: ‘No, I didn’t cut him down. Matter of fact,
I didn’t like the man.’ ”

Old “Billy the Dodger” reckoned that
he had a soft thing for life when he per-
suaded the Mines Department to advance “aid” for
driving a tunnel along the old lead at Wangat. He
and Dutch Peter worked steadily at the job for over
five years, and if there was no reef or gold worth
speaking of the Department’s cheque never failed to
materialise. One day they walked to the face to
see the results of a couple of shots fired the night
before, and were stupefied to find that they had
blown into someone else’s workings. There was no
other tunnel within a mile, and terrified lest they
had disturbed the pathway to Hades, they fled to
daylight. A week after, the warden came along for a
final “measure-up” and discovered that for years the
prospectors had been driving in a circle and had
finally broken into their own tunnel.

THE RIVERINA ROADS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a scent of breathing trees
And a whisper on the breeze
Through the crowded city blown;
And the whisper and the scent
On the silken breeze are meant
Just for vagabonds alone;
And they set my blood aglow,
And a-roving I must go
Down the long, long roads of Riverina.
Though we hew and delve and spin,
There’s a vagabond within
That will up and out at times ;
And ’tis easily he’s fed,
Caring less for meat and bread
Than for vagrant songs and rhymes ;
And ’tis he that makes me long
For the golden lights that throng
On the long, Jong roads of Riverina.
For with ne’er a by-your-leave
How he tugs me by the sleeve,
How he nudges me—the knave 1 —•
And I yield myself, alas
(For a cunning wit he has,
And a winsome'way and brave),
To the gate that he would go,
Where the silken breezes blow
On the long, long roads of Riverina.
Yet let me think awhile
As he paints them, mile and mile,
Over level land and range;
Since I left them, many years,
With their hosts of hopes and fears,
And their tides of chance and change,
Have gone down them, and, perchance,
Taken all the young romance
From the long, long roads of Riverina.
Though with eyes unchanged I came,
Would the picture be the same?
Would the plains be quite as wide?
Would the flocks be full as vast,
And the herds go slowly past—-
Flanks aheave, and sullen-eyed,
As they did, and were,, and seemed
When I camped, and smoked, and dreamed
By the long, long roads of Riverina?
Does a generous welcome wait
At each down-thrown sliprail gate,
As it did in days agone,
When old Hospitality
Knew not lock, nor bolt, nor key,
And his genial presence shone
On the four walls of each room
When the white stars lit the gloom
Of the long, long roads of Riverina?
Does old mateship tread the ways
As he did in other days—-
Gentle ever, ever brave—■
With a soul to hear and heed,
And a hand outstretched in need,
And a heart to seek and save?
Ah, the better things than gold
That were given and prized of old
On the long, long roads of Riverina.
Would she wait again for me
As the sun sank rosily,
To the magpie’s liquid pipe—
With her dark and dainty head,
And her mouth of cherry red,
And herself a cherry ripe?
Nay, I know that laughing love
Nevermore for me shall move
Down the long, long roads of Riverina.
Yet the scent of breathing trees
And the whisper on the breeze
Through the crowded city float;
And with fancies, fair and fond,
Comes the careless vagabond,
And he tugs me by the coat,
And he sets my blood aglow,
And a-roving I must go
Down the long, long roads of Riverina.
K.s.w.

CARLTON ALE
FOSTER’S LAGER
From an English church magazine :
The Australian buzzard loves to feed on the eggs
of the emu. It will attack with great ferocity a
female emu fitting on her eggs, until it succeeds
in driving her from the nest, when it takes up a
stone in its claws, and while hovering over the nest
lets it fall to crush the hard shells, and then descends
and devours their contents.
Tu the Old Man Plain, where there are no stones, the
buzzard, full of that intelligence which is so marked
in Australia even amongst the wealthy classes, breaks
the eggs by filling his claws with heavy ironsand and
leaping up and down on the nest.
A SHATTERED IDOL.
THE ADMIRER: “Oh, there's Clarence j he says he played in the movies opposite Mary
Pickford.”
GEORGE : “So he did. He played the piano."
J.”: At Lake Macquarie (N.S.W.) in
April I sighted what at first appeared to be two
baby sharks swimming about in tire salt water, but
which proved to be duck-billed platypuses. They
seemed to be tame, for we were able to steer
the launch within 10ft. of them before they dived.
These specimens were dark-grey in color. Local
residents speak of platypuses having been reported
in the Lake district within the last two or three
years. One or two have been met around Cessnock
during the same period, but always in fresh water.
“Tavitou”: “Chloe” (B. G/G/’IS) is, I
think, correct in querying “Mick Anick’s” (B.
9/5/’IS) theory of inducing the male paw-paw
(Carica papaya), also called Mammy Apple, to beat-
fruit by driving nails into the stem. The plant is
credited with many odd habits, and I have had male
plants bear a sort of fruit at end of the flowers, not
unlike a pear in shape. The fruit failed to develop into
anything like the real article. Here, on Richmond
River, are growing two well-developed female plants
bearing a number of well-grown fruit, but for every
fruit which remained on the plants 11 fell oil'
for want of fertilisation, there being no male plants
nearer than 1000 ft. A number of plants are
uasexual. In the case of Aucuba japonica, unless
both male and female are in close proximity, the
plant reproduces no berry on the female. The Carica
/papaya is one of the few plants in Australia which
contributes to the British Pharmacopoeia. The juices
of the plant induce the flow of milk in the human
system.
* * * *
“D.F.”: What we don’t know about Aus-
tralian animals would fill a library, and at the present
rate of progress some of the species will be extinct
before we know much more about them. What
do we know about such an obvious problem
as the nature and use of the spurs of the male
platypus? Inside him the platypus _has organs of
whose economy and use little is known, and yet one
would imagine that this animal, a genuine missing
link, would long since have been the subject of the
most searching investigation. That brainier cousin
of the platypus, the echidna, porcupine or ant-eater,
the only other monotreme in the world, seems to
have received even less attention. The wombat is
one of the very few animals that boasts an appendix
like man’s, but oux* knowledge of the beast seems
to be about as advanced as it was in the time of
Ueorge Bass, who observed: “This animal is very
economically made.”
* * * *
“Dinkum Stuff”: This is what I know
about it. Some years ago a girl living near KeWell
(Vic.) started to make a batch of tarts, and the
jam supply gave out. A search revealed a partly-filled
tin (labels fallen away) in a disused stripper, but
being mouldy it was thrown to the pigs. It was not
long until the detested of Abraham displayed
symptoms of strychnine poisoning, and all passed
out. The “jam” was rabbit poison, and I know it
contained strychnine because I prepared it myself.
THE FAMILY LEECH.
"But didn't her father go after you when you and your wife eloped?"
"He did. He s been with us ever since.”
“Lantana”: Droving isn’t wliat it used
to l>e. Recently a mob of cattle started from the
South Coast (N.S.W.) en route to Nimitybellc,
with a motor-car in attendance carrying bedding,
cooking, gear and (I suspect) the drovers’ evening-
dress suits. We’ll see the boss yet with satin bows
on his spurs and the cook weaving spats.

The other day a Club at Wallan
(Vic.) asked the Broadmeadows Shire Council for
permission to plant an Avenue of Honor on one of
the district roads. The intention was to plant only
Australian trees, one in the name of every soldier
who enlisted from the district. It was rightly con-
sidered that this memorial would be more suitable
than useless monuments of wood or stone. The
request duly came before the Broadmeadows bumbles,
who frowned heavily on the idea of planting Aus-
tralian trees. The engineer was told to lay out lines
for the trees, but not one word was said in favor of
our gums. The only three kinds of trees they men-
tioned were elms, oaks and pines. The elm is about
one of the worst trees that can be planted, as it
throws up millions of suckers and takes possession of
the footpaths and garden plots adjacent. Some
varieties of oalc are nearly as bad. Whilst as a
memorial tree that is to live for generations a more
unsuitable tree than the short-lived pious insignia
cannot *he found. Vo \v whore are there more
beautiful trees in any part of the world than the
following: (1) The scarlet flowering gum, (2)
pink flowering red-gum, (3) . pink flowering’ iron-
bark, (4) lemon-scented gum, (5) sugar gum, (6)
peppermint gum and (7) bastard mahogany? These
trees are all hardy and would flourish anywhere south
of the Dividing Range. They will not die out in a
few years like a lot of imported trees, or grow too
big or look like a lot of dead trees for about half
the year. Finally, they will not fill the gutters and
waterspouts with hundredweights of dead and dying
leaves, like the elm, oak and other deciduous veg-
etables.

“Snaffle Bit” : This is the ticket for .swamp
cancer on horses. Spirit of salts, eight parts; water,
two parts. Or this: vinegar essence (two ounce)
'' ith as much saltpetre and powdered boracic acid,
in equal parts, as the liquid will absorb. Apply
with sponge in each case.

“Cave Man”: The best way of preparing
“black” thistle-root for rabbit-poisoning is to slice
and cut the vegetable into blocks about half an inch
long. Spread them out evenly on a sheet of paper.
Powder up very fine the lid of a match-box full of
strychnine to every two pounds of roots. Sprinkle
evenly through a caster over the surface, and do like-
wise with a little flour to make the poison stick. Now
put all that in the plough, draw a furrow in the
infested spots, and drop the baits every vard or so.
This method takes more bait than the way mentioned
by John Quill ’ recently, and therefore more poison,
but it is more thorough and accumulates for a great
many more profit-.
“E.S.S. ’: Talking of shipbuilding, when
the rich scrub-timbers were first tapped on the Hast-
ings and Manning (N.S.W.) the pioneers built their
own scows, cutting the material in the scrubs with
pitsaws, and in the forests with axes and crosscuts.-
When a vessel was loaded with timber the timber-
getters manned her themselves and sailed a wav with
their cargo to Sydney. There were plenty of'sailors
amongst the cutters, and they managed to get to
port and back without serious mishap, although t.hov
were mostly boozed on the return voyage. They
brought home stores and liquor, and seldom
a tap of work was done ashore while the rum
held out. When the jamboree was ended all
hands set about cutting- another cargo of timber.
Pelican, on the Manning, was an important place in
ISol, for Captain Alex. Newton had established ship-
budding- yards there, and many a schooner, brig- and
barque was launched from his stocks.

Bai-coo”: Billy Moore, owner of Juandali
rattle station, Dawson River (Q.), formerly M.L \
was a great bird-lover. The butcher on 'the place
had instructions to throw a. good feed of chopped
meat to the bush citizens every morning at sunrise
and neglect of the order was rewarded with the
sac-k. Ihe number of kookaburras who attended the
banquets was astonishing. live seen the boss acting
as head-waiter, and the Jacks would perch all over
him in their eagerness for breakfast. When he was
out on the run he always carried a game-bag full of
meat-pellets for his pals, and they would follow him,
m ing from tree to tree, for miles.

no munition workers, a negligible number of unfit,
and no indispensables, as campaigns were short ana
work was suspended till the boys came home.
that basis a million soldiers could well be raiseu
from the two kingdoms. When kerxes ot
Persia invaded the small conglomeration ot state
known as Greece he had a following ot two
millions, and the Greeks sent them back again
what was left of them. “Solomon slew 120,000
sheep and 22,000 oxen in one act,” says hdmonu,
“in a national thanksgiving lasting a fortnight tor
an event which their great-great-grandfathers had
prayed for, viz., the opening of the Temple, Enjan
killed 950 false prophets, which suggests that talse
prophecy was a big industry.” If Elijah had lived
to-day he might have killed 9500, without receiving
a newspaper paragraph. “A wall (of some size) fell
on the remains of the army and killed 27,000. Yes ,
walls were of some size then. The wall ot Babylon,
the antiquarians tell us, was 45 miles in circum-
ference, 200 ft. high and 50ft. broad. You could
encamp the whole A.I.F. beneath it, .and if the s t° n e
fell the survivors would be fortunate and might back
an outsider and expect a win. “Nebuchadnezzai
looted the Temple at Jerusalem of its treasures, in-
cluding 5400 vessels, large and small, of real gold—
this although the building, about 35 yards long by
12 yards broad, had been previously plundered six
times.” Ezra says 5400 vessels of gold and silver,
which latter is not usually called real gold. Thirty-
five yards by 12 yards were the measurements of the
inner temple; it is not to be supposed that the other
chambers and courts, which were continually being
added to, were bare of ornament. The sixth looting
took place in 713 b.c. Josiah restored the Temple s
glory about 624 li.c. Neb. was there for the first
time in 606 b.c.
James Edmond :—■
A few hurried words in reply to the more impor-
tant points:—
The two kingdoms (Israel and Judah) covered
11,000 square miles. They have been measured over
and over again bv modern authorities. Judah was
about 2500 square miles—say one-tenth of Tasmania.
It is better able to carry population now than ot old
because it includes the Philistine strip, which it never
did in the pre-Nebucliadnezzar days ; because it has
a few roads made by Romans, Crusaders and Fiench-
men; and because it has a great source ot revenue
from the visitors to the scene of the Crucifixion.
Also it has a railway. But it is a place without
harbors, shipping, coal arid iron mines or any big
manufactures. It has still the old hand-made agri-
culture described in the Bible. It still carries most
of its goods on ass-back. It has still the same
stretches of barren limestone and the same old
wilderness. It has about 300,000 people now despite
all its new advantages, and it is difficult to believe
that it ever supported many more. Old Israel has
about 600,000 people. Yet we are told that m Judah
alone —not the two kingdoms—Jehoshaphat had a
standing army which “waited on the king” and was
“ready prepared for war” of 1,160,000 men, besides
the garrisons “throughout all Judah.” Allowing a
mere 90,000 for garrisons that would be 500 perma-
nent soldiers to the square mile. England holds only
a little more than that number of people to the
square mile. Polygamy wasn’t a regular habit; it
almost died out of notice after the great burst ot
Solomon. And even if it was universal in Tasmania
(about 10 times the size of Judah) it would hardly
qualify that island to support a standing army ot 11
million men, apart from garrisons. The great, army
of less than two millions which Xerxes gathered from
the biggest empire of antiquity had nothing to do
with the possible army of Judah, which was only a
pin-point on the surface of Xerxes’s dominions. Wars
weren’t necessarily short and sudden amid the Kings
and Chronicles. " Samaria was said to have been
besieged for years, and Asa and Baasha scrapped all
their days.” There was only one Babylon, reputedly
the greatest city of the world in its day, a great
metropolis and a place that made history. Its
gigantic fortifications had no more to do with the
casual once-mentioned wall which allegedly fell and
killed 27,000 men —wounded not enumerated—at an
obscure place on the road to nowhere in particular
than Paris and its defences have to do with a hen-
house at Taree. The Hebrew was a very poor builder,
and his very few great constructions, like the Temple
at Jerusalem and the city of Samaria, were done by
hired Phoenicians. His own abilities can probably be
estimated by the disinterred town of Jericho No. 2,
and they are poor enough. Also Elijah didn’t kill
his regiment of prophets in the newspaper-files of a
whole continent extending over four years ; he is said
to have killed the entire squad on the grass in one
evening, and even now the crowd makes holiday there
on the alleged anniversary. And Josiah didn’t “restore
the glory of the Temple’’—-perhaps because there
never was much. He just repaired it with stone and
wood and replaced missing floors. If that was
“glory” then the inglorious Temple must have been
a poor sort of shack. But there is no room for all
the big things of these big days. Even the 120,000
“valiant men” that Pekah slew in the little speck of
Judah in one daj r and the 200,000 prisoners he took
must be crowded out.
The Inky Way
Keith Henderson’s Letters to Helen
(Chatto and Windus, per Melville and Mul-
len, Melb., 65.) are lightly interesting; but
they serve to introduce a delightful artist
at the Front. The illustrations are in frank
contrast to those of Muirhead Bone. Where
Bone sees only dreariness in modern war-
scapes, Henderson sees beauty. The pic-
tures, reproduced in color, are exquisite.
The explosion of an ammunition dump is as
beautiful as' a Japanese print; star-shells at
night and a stranded tank 'become things of
loveliness; and even ruined villages are pic-
turesque. Apparently Henderson works in
crayon.
Australia’s old friend, W. N. Willis, lately
concluded a legal argument with the English
publishing firm of Stanley, Paul & Co., who
got out three of his “white slave” books, and
didn’t do the job to his satisfaction. “Nick”
claimed accounts of the publications, dam-
ages for alleged infringement in publishing
certain books after the assignment to the pub-
lishers had run out, and more damages be-
cause defendants had not taken out the
American copyright of some of his works.
He also complained that a 2s. edition of his
“White Slaves of London” had been issued
without his consent and the proceeds had
never been brought into account. Willis
was hard pressed in cross-examination, but
the Judge was, he said, quite sure there was
nothing against Nick. Which was some con-
solation after judgment had been entered
for defendants with costs. ’ •
Latest London Times literary supplement
has some complimentary remarks about the
book of verses selected from The Bulletin
for the benefit of the Sydney Children’s
Hospital. These little rimes with their
clever illustrations, ’it says, show that
Australia’s local nursery rimes “suit it
better than the traditional English ones.”
The same issue has a lengthy and apprecia-
tive review of Leon Gellert’s “Songs of a
Campaign.”
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Quidam” : Some years ago when suction-
gas engines were becoming popular in Aus-
tralia, one British firm, who sold their
engines under a guarantee to produce a
stated horse-power, sent out an expert to
ascertain how much inferior Australian
hardwood charcoal was compared with
anthractic coal, the fuel used in England,
the idea being to supply generators of larger
capacity to allow for the inferior fuel.
Under instructions from the manufacturers,
the Australian agents had been advising
engine-owners to use a mixture of coke and
charcoal. After testing the charcoal the
expert was surprised to find that not only
was Australian hardwood charcoal not in-
ferior to Welsh anthracite, but that it actu-
ally gave a purer carbon and was superior
for gas-producing purposes. And, now,
prompted by the prohibitive price of zinc
shavings, and following on the lines of the
zinc-dust process, which has so largely super-
seded shavings in the cyanide industry,
charcoal dust has been tried in Westralia
and found very satisfactory, almost perfect
precipitation of the fuel being obtained. The
coal is crushed to a fine powder, agitated
with the solution and then sucked off by a
vacuum fitter. Besides being cheap to pro-
cure, the charcoal, after being roasted, is
particularly easy and cheap to smelt, re-
quiring no acid treatment and being almost
a self-fluxing material. It is not unlikely
that this development of the charcoal pre-
cipitation process, which in its primitive
form was evolved in Victoria in the early
days of cyaniding, will eventually oust the
zinc process altogether.
* * * *
“F.N.T.” : Now that tin-plates are scarce,
Australian jam-makers are hard put to it to
find containers for their goods. The latest is
a “tin” with a heavy cardboard body, metal
top and bottom, and the label in the usual
place, so that the article looks as attractive
as the original. The make-shift is claimed
to be quite sanitary. Another substitute,
which has a good deal to commend it in
spite of its greater cost, is a container of the
material from which “stone” gingerbeer
bottles are made. The added advantage of
this material is that there is no waste.

“Wart”: McCall, the Speck’s Agent-
General, is now writing his reports from
London on paper made of Tasmanian blue-
gum, the timber which the specially imported
Yankee expert Surface said was too short in
fibre. Fortunately somebody looked further

* * * *
“Pharmo’s” wail:—
In the award of the Wages Board, Vie., for
chemists, which comes into operation on July 1, the
qualified man is awarded for 51 hours per week the
sum of £3, and if he happens to be a manager, £5.
The unqualified man is valued at £2 10s. to
£3 12s. 6d. per week. Now let me outline the dif-
ference between a qualified and unqualified chemist.
To qualify, one has to pass a preliminary examina-
tion of approximately the same standard as the
Junior Public Service; next, serve an apprenticeship
to a qualified chemist keeping open shop for the
term of four years. During the fourth year one is
allowed to attend the College of Pharmacy and
receive instruction in some half-dozen subjects.
Should the student be successful in passing the exam,
at the end of that year •he is allowed to study
and sit for his final qualifying exam, if he has
attained the age of 21 years. On passing the final
he is eligible for registration under the Medical
Act as a qualified chemist. During his apprentice-
ship the wages range from 10s. per week in the first
year to 255. per week in the fourth year. This is
never considered as anything more than pocket-
money. The total cost in cash, without considering
expenditure of brain matter, to become a qualified
man is estimated at £5OO. This amount covers
premium, living expenses, exam, and college fees,
books, chemical apparatus, registration fees and
other incidentals. Now let us consider the unquali-
fied. The most common specimen is a man who has
passed the prelim, exam, and served an apprentice-
ship of four years. Either he has not the ability
to pass the other important exams., or, as is more
probable, has been prevented continuing his educa-
tion through absence of capital. This is the man
who is to receive up to £3 12s. 6d. as against the
£3 for a qualified man who is not a manager. The
unqualified man is certainly worth £3 12s. 6d. for
the services which he gives, but isn’t the qualified
man worth more in proportion?
“Branx”: My softgoods friend Tape-
measure showed me a few lines in Australian-
made hosiery the other day. Cotton and
half-cotton golf-hose, badly dyed and high-
priced, bear a large “Made in Australia’
label; but well-made, all-wool stuff, well-
dyed and a credit to any manufacturer, bears
no label at all. Thus do we keep alive the
importer’s old lie that “the colonial goods
are inferior, sir.’’
* * * *
“Shakemup”: Melbourne likes dragging
things about. So far as I can see none of
the large industries are connected direct by
railway, so all heavy haulage is over the
main streets and roads. On the south side
of the Yarra large timber- and iron-yards,
rolling-mills, etc., have grown up and are
daily expanding, but not one of them have
rail facilities. Consequently, all day long
huge logs of timber, long girders, iron, steam
boilers and engines are hauled over the
costly paved thoroughfares to the ruin of
same and discomfiture of traffic in general.
Even the Electric Power House, in Spencer-
street, is isolated, and all its coal has to be
tugged up Spencer-street hill in horse-drays,
though the power-house is on a level, and
immediately opposite the railway system.
“.303”: A midwinter ad. from S. M.
Herald :

water fountain, 3 gal, and iron boiler, 0 gal., ami

Somebody must have told him they were pot-
boilers. #
“Demos’’: Tasmanian fruitgrowers are ex-
periencing some of the benefits of the foreign-
trade policy. In the past they concentrated
all their attention on the English export
trade and regarded the local market merely
as a dumping-ground for apples that would
not pass muster in the overseas markets.
Now that the war has cut out the European
market the local Consumer is in a posi-
tion to be fastidious, and rejects all but the
very best fruit. The other grades are
passed into the canning factories at a price
which makes growers wince every time they
get their accounts of sales. But even the can-
ning market has failed them. Jones and
Go. have announced that owing to the im-
possibility of securing tin-plates they
cannot take any more apples. The Speck is
the third largest producer of tin ore in the
world, but owing to its policy of importing
everything possible, no tin-plates have ever
been made locally.
* * * *
“Ralle”: Don’t tell me that there is a
shortage of paper. I have just seen the
printed form upon which the Munitions
Department despatches its telegrams, averag-
ing 16 to 20 words. It is a high-grade paper
of a delicate pink shade and is of foolscap
size. Every day the Department sends dozens
of telegrams scrawled on these banners.
* * * *
“Copabella” : In Braybrook, the Victorian
boiling-down district, a new generation has
arisen which turns its nose up at the old
hereditary stinks. Councillor Violets, a
dainty newcomer, lately ventured to sneer at
the boiling-down studios. Up got old Coun-
cillor Hides, full of wrath: “You must be
an aristocrat if you object to these trades!”
he snorted. A nose test like this would have
simplified the French Revolution.
“Bill Bowyang” : Billjim finds time to fos-
sick around between engagements with Abdul.
He has just discovered evidences of
petroleum-bearing shale near Beersheba, and
the military are taking a big interest in the
discovery. If the find is as good as reported
it will be a big thing .for Egypt. These days
petroleum is about the most precious liquid
in the land of the lamented Pharaohs.

A candid Melbourne tailor fired this at a

“Wart”: The 8.M.A.. which has a good
few quarrels on its hands, has at last taken
up one which is likely to bring it some popu-
larity. Dr. Love, who was second medical-
officer of the Queenstown (Tas.) Hospital,
volunteered for active service and obtained
a substitute to keep his hospital work going.
The Board, however, declined to agree with
the arrangement, and advertised for a doctor.
Then the B.M.A. fired a shot. Unless, the
Association declared, the appointment was a
temporary one none of the B.M.A. members
would act. The Board surrendered.

Sooner or later you will come to it
If ' Australia proposes to build
ships, which are so badly wanted,
then the best methods and facili-
ties must be utilised.
According to authorities this is
the way to hasten construction,
not only because it results in
more effort being put forth in
each calendar day, but because
it is the best way to dilute skilled
labour with unskilled.
At the wood shipyard of the
United States Steamship Com-
pany the night shift has proved
its case.
“ Contrary to expectations,” says the
New York Tribune, it is found that
certain kinds of work go forward
faster by night than by day. With
the particular field of operations of
each gang bathed in artificial light
and with darkness shrouding the yard
as a whole, the men seem to concen-
trate more steadily and efficiently
than in the daytime.”
There’s a real need for Flood-
lighting. It is the one kind of
lighting that will put speed and
efficiency into night work. It is
the one kind of lighting that
every shipyard, dry-dock and
loading pier in the country needs
for protection.
G-E Floodlight Projectors—built
for hard service quickly in-
stalled —five distinct types —all
necessary sizes. Get the aid of
G-E Floodlighting Specialists—

n
Floodlighting is equally effective for night-shift work on Railway
.construction and loading of ships, as well as for the illumination
of buildings, which by this method are emphasised in strong relief.

The Plant is Simple, Efficient and Durable.
DKECOEIGHT consists of an engine, generator, switchboard and set
of batteries. The engine and generator are direct connected,
which does away with any transmission losses or belt trouble,
increasing the efficiency of the machine. The storage battery is of the
special Delco-Eight type, consisting of sixteen g'lass jar cells, deliveiing
32- volt current. Unless the demand for light and power is very heavy, it
is unnecessary to run the engine, except when the storage battery
requires recharging.
Electricity is stored up in the battery by means of the generating
unit. Wires lead from the light and power connections to this storage
battery, from which electric current is used as desired for light 01 power.
You will find Delco-Eight to be a model of simplicity. When it
becomes necessary to re-charge the battery, the engine is started b\
merelv pressing in on the starting switch located on the switchboard.
This electrically cranks the engine, just as the automobile engine is
cranked by an electric self-starter. The engine starts running on its own
power in a few seconds. It can then be left to itself, as when the batter}'
is completely charged the Delco-Eight engine stops automatically.

“First Old Man”: Some highly-colored
American posters which the J.C.VV. firm is
utilising to boost their new musical-comedy
“Oh, Boy,” advertise the fact that the pro-
.. ducer of the show in New 7 York bore the
well-known and respected name of Edward
Royce. He is, of course, the son of the old-
time mummer of the same name who w 7 as one
ot the best Jaikes seen on Australian boards,
and he is still living. Royce, junior, gradu-
ated in the art of stage-production with past-
master Robert Courtneidge, in England, but
for some years past American managers have
had the profit of his services.
“Silas” : The rush of Little Bourke Chows
into the Royal to protest against certain
Celestial elements in “The Man who Came
Back” was not the only occasion of a Mon-
golian invasion of the theatre. Many years
ago, when a (Blandoltian, I think) melo-
drama was running, the Confucians in the
back street were so disgusted with the duties
of a pro. depicting an unsympathetic Chinese
cook that one night they organised a rear
attack, rushed the
house, and securing
the object of their
resentment were
swarming all over
him, eating \>m
seemingly, wli e n
the full strength of
the co. counter-
attacked with the
properties of a
stage kitchen, and
drove the discolored
tribe back to the
jungle with horrid
slaughter. Long be-
fore that “Lilly
Bluck” had taken
exception to a per-
formance of “The
Mikado” at the
Royal, believing it
to be some kind of
gross insult levelled
at Pekin, and for a
week the actors had
to leave by the
front door to avoid
an indignant
Chinese rising
waiting for them at
the stage entrance.
Then one night the
Mikado, Pooh Bah
and Nanki Poo, in
full rig, emerged
from the Little
Bourke portal, and
were caught by the
heathen in his
blindness. Little
Bourke regretted
its success for
years. The supposed
actors were three

Melbourne pugs—the toughest rough-ups

Will YVliitburn, who used to be one of
Harry Rickards’s permanent hands, now
lives the simple, grassfed life at the Mel-
bourne suburb of Clayton, where he trains
his trotting horses. There is a large family,
all girls, and used to the saddle. Domestic
references to Will’s humorous burnt-cork past
are strictly taboo; and it is hard to identify
t in the tough-skinned sport the quaint, humor-
ist who used to wake the laughter of Aus-
tralia.
“Ts”v Commander Robert Loraine, M.C.,
dead from wounds, beauty actor and aviator,
was not a slave to his stage appearance.
Although matinee flappers (young and
middle-aged) clamored for him in romantic
roles, he side-stepped when he could to do
good work in plays of literary distinction,
notably when he played John in Pshaw’s
Man and Superman.” He was well known
as an aviator long before the war, and it
was because of his refusal to give up flying
that Marie Lohr broke off her engagement
to him and married Val Prinseps. Perhaps
she thought the airman was too much above
her.
Daphne Pollard is starred in London as
the “great little Anzac” in a “Box o’
Tricks,” a revue. Doesn’t the prohibition of
the word Anzac for advertising purposes
extend beyond Australia?
The Wimmera disaster made the Bing
Boys co. very thoughtful. When the news
of it reached them in Adelaide they were
just finishing their packing for a special
train for Sydney, where they were to catch
the boat for M.L. The mine might just
as well have been struck on that voyage
as on the previous one; also there may
easily be more mines along the track. But
the perils of the deep had to be faced, and
after some vigorous use of the wires bv
Herbert Myers, who runs the Adelaide end
of the Firm’s business, the co. started its
voyage from Melbourne instead of Sydney.
“Jeune Premier”: Mention of “the pro-
phetic anti-German play, ‘An Englishman’s
Home’” (“J.F.H.,” B. 4/7/T8), reminds me
that there was precious little honor for the
prophet in this country, when Du Maurier s
piece was played. Audiences mostly looked
on it as a “spoof” and resented being
"kidded.” I myself can vouch for the fact
that at one performance in Sydney some dis-
gusted galleryites clamored for their money
back when the first curtain had fallen on old
Brown’s villa being raided and bombarded
by Germans. I wonder what comment those
same fatheads would make these days.
“Meib”: The G.-G. has just planted an
array of little trees along the north bank of
the Yarra. past where Cremorne Gardens
stood. Few would remember old Cremorne,
the site of which is quite obliterated. Even
the lake is gone. There is a small township
over the spot. Ellis, from the London Cre-
morne. established the gardens and placed
on the river the passenger steamer which was
built on Yarra bank to the eastward. Cop-
pin and G. V. Brooke bought the place in
partnership. There used to be a dancing
pagoda, theatre, circus and menagerie, with
a panorama and fireworks on the lake.
Spiers and Pond ran the restaurant.
“Peter”: The habit of embezzling an
author’s letterpress for the descriptive
matter in the film founded on his plot made
its Australian dtibut in the Sydney Equity
Court a few days ago. It is a common
misdemeanor in America. A while back
Gilbert Parker, author of “The Right of
Way,” discovered that a well-known picture
factory had “borrowed” practically his
entire story, the “cut-ins” being slabs of
his own composition, with the exception that
sorrte of the names had been changed.
Naturally Parker was annoyed. In fact, it
took quite a big bag of dollars to soothe his
wounded feelings.
Australia’s old friend, Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis, has lately been touring the English
provinces in “Daddy Longlegs” in the part
of the old nurse, played here by Maggie
Moore.
“0 ; K.”: The oft-repeated “Rackety Coo”
refrain in “Ivatinka” seems to be a direct
lineal descendant of the once-famous “Glou-
glou” duet in “La Mascotte.” “Rackety” is
not less like the love vow of turtle-doves than
“Glou-glou” was like the conversation of
cattle, but the melody is hardly so catchy.
By the way, will there never be another re-
vival of “Mascotte”? The music of the
opera and the manner of its humor would
come new to a generation that has been fed
on French caf£ scenes, with their broad hints
of conjugal misdemeanors. The name car-
ries its own advertisement.
“Fax”: W. S. Percy, who seems to have
made good in England as a “straight”
comedian, is one of the very few of old Tom
Pollard’s co. that has continued to be up-stage.
Not one juvenile comedian in a hundred
matures into a clever actor. Percy’s first
appearance in Sydney and Melbourne was
26 years ago. when he played a minor part
in “The Gondoliers” with the Lilliputians.
“Stargazer”: One or two of the papers
in Melbourne reviewing “De Luxe Annie”
at the King’s spoke of it as being founded
on a_ flimsy story written to while away a
half-hour on a
railway train. I
read “De Luxe
Annie” in the
Amei’ican weekly
in which it first
appeared and
found _ it _ an ex-
traordinarily clever
story, the best psy-
chological yarn I
had read in years,
the clever theme
wonderfully elabo-
rated, the literary
workmanship fine,
the whole thing an
absorbing work of
art, the only griev-
ous mistake being
the trifling title
which suggested
cheapness where
nothing else was
cheap. In short,
the story was ever
so much a better
thing than the
“The Thirteenth
Chair,” at Sydney
Criterion.

play is, admitting that the latter is a smart
and fairly successful entertainment.
“Once Bitten” : During the first perform-
ance in Sydney of “The Masquerader” G. B.
Post’s long-haired dog thumped down on his
tail and started to hurriedly audit the live-
stock. Having once been bitten by a theatre
flea I felt sorry for the hound and wished
him success in his search. My bite was
acquired while sitting on a dingy travelling
basket at Sydney Royal, and I thought I
had been stung by a red-hot centipede. The
ordinary flea of old houses is a passing
annoyance to be lightly dismissed; the senior
theatre flea, who has bitten thousands of
middle-aged theatre-goers who can’t retaliate
and who has grown long fangs in the process,
is so sudden and savage that the tender
visitor is liable to overlook the third Com-
mandment.
The travelling picture palace, otherwise
called a “einemotor,” is a new feature in the
business in England. A small fleet of them
has been sent out by the newly-appointed
Minister of Information to show something
of the war in villages too small to have a
picture-theatre of their own.

GERTIE’S CAREER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Methinks the limelight rarely shone
On brighter maid than Gertie Green,
Who got a job at “walking on’’
When she was sweet and seventeen.
She set her face against transgression
When first she dreamed of the “profession.”
But having learned to walk the stage,
And bring a letter orxa tray,
She found that girls of greater i-ge
Got all the two-line parts to saj.
These others were a trifle radish,
They scoffed at patient Gut as prudish.
The manager, whose giddy glance
In vain invited Gert’s glad eye,
Began to look at her askance:
Both fame and fortune passed her by.
The other girls did ail the talking,
Whilst she, poor novice, kept on walking.
At twenty she was thin and pale,
Still waiting for a chance to act;
Her older colleagues, fair but frail,
Had all the chances, that’s a fact.
The prudish maid, in silence moping,
Played housemaid parts and kept on hoping.
For years she labored on the stage:
She painted lines around her mouth,
Indicative of middle-age,
Until the memories of youth
Grew dim within her mind, and Gertie
Was something more than eight-and-thirty.
And then, at last, she got a show 1
As Juliet she made her mark;
The lights were kept discreetly low,
The stage, at times, was rather dark.
She played with passion, strong, intense,
Born of her past experience,
I saw her act the other night— i
And cursed the irony of fate.
Her hair hung loose, she looked a “sight” ;
But as an artist she was great.
She played, did poor old Gertie Green,
A happy maid of seventeen.
VICTORIA.
O. K.
AS USUAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We went to walk the prison through.
All curious the sights to see,
And there among the branded crew
I saw Fitzpatric Bollingbee,
Fitzpatric Bollingbee, the pro.
We knew so well some years ago.
Fitzpatric sat upon a pile,
And with a little hammer smote
The rock. No evidence of guile
Upon his forehead could I note,
Nor did the gifted fellow quail
To find an audience in gaol.
I spoke to him in friendly wise,
Inquiring what had gone amiss.
Sure some misfortunate emprise
Had brought the actor down to this.
AVith dignity he bent his head.
“I’m resting, sirs,” Fitzpatric said.

Fairfax S Roberts Ltd.,
The Oldest Jewellery House in Sydney,
23 and 25 Hunter Street.
The late Geox-ge Alexander left an estate
valxxed at nearly £lOO,OOO, thanks, apparently,
to his early business training. lie graduated
for the stage from the counting-house of a
soft-goods warehouse which was noted for
its dramatic club. Alexander’s family name
was Samson, and though he spoke of himself
as Scotch, George Alexander Gibson Samson
must have been Hebrew Scottish. His aim
in life, as he told a friend when he had
served some years of apprenticeship in Henry
Irving’s co. and was already himself a ris-
ing manager, was to provide for a comfort-
able old age. To boom himself as an actor
was no part of his ambition, and he never
made the error of putting himself into a
star part beyond his capabilities. He
reckoned himself the happiest of theatrical
managerial husbands because his wife had
always been an interested helpmate, without
nursing a desire to play any part in his co.
The misfortune of many a good actor who
runs his own show is a missus who insists
upon heading the salary list.
“S.S.”: We were discussing the fortunes
of war, and the light comedian mentioned
that a certain American vaudeville enter-
tainer who has visited Australia on two or
three occasions had been wounded in the
face. A brother vaudevillain present seemed
to take this very much to heart. He made
various sympathetic noises. “That’s too
bad,” said he. “Altered his face altogether.
Thei’e’s rotten luck if you like. Poor devil,
he’ll have to get a wholly new set of win-
dow bills after the war.” /
The feeble show “Twin Beds” has passed
from Australia to London, camouflaged
as “Be Careful, Baby,” in deference to
John Bull censors, who apparently take the
view that stage beds may be seen but not
mentioned. Helen Raymond, a Yankee
actress, has scored a hit as the absurd
tenor’s signora, a part that went for little
here.
“E.T.”: 11. B. Irving, in the intervals of
actor-management, still pursues his studies in
criminology. He has just published another
volume on his pet subject, “A Book of Re-
markable Criminals.” In a fairly compre-
hensive list of notorious assassins, amongst
which Butler, the Dunedin (M.L.) mur-
derer, finds a place. Says Irving of the
latter: “The criminal by instinct, belonging
to that particular type of the envious nature
which Shakspeare is fond of exemplifying
with moi’e or less degrees of villainy in Such
characters as lago. Edmund, Don John, of
which Richard Butler is a living instance.”
“Polj” : Two successful comedies at 17 is
not a bad record for an English youth, one
Vincent Douglass. He’s had “Jeffersons”
touring for two years and it is to go into
London soon. The other piece is “Uncle
Theodoi’e.” Grandfather, father and uncles
were and are all theatrical pen-pushers and
owners of theatres—particularly owners of
theatres, which may account for more than
assaxxlts the eye.
“J.F.11.”: “This* is a cheerful entertain-
ment, half-rape, half-vivisection.” So the
dramatic cidtic of the London Daily Tele-
graph begins his notice of “The Knife,” an
American problem-play presented at the
Comedy with Miss Kyrle Bellew, once of
Australia, in the leading feminine role. There
had been some difficulty in getting a license
for its production, but certain alterations and
modifications eventually ovei'came the cen-
sor’s objections. But it is still vei’y strong
meat, not properly fitted for presentation
before the average mixed audience.
Killed in France after a vigorous
time aloft. Flight-commander Robert Lor-
raine, M.C., who was a notable English
actoi\ He was the airman who gave up a
life of matrimony with sweet Marie Lohr
rather than surrender to the lady’s wish that
he should remain on the deck of the world.
In the minds of London playgoers Lorraine
was most associated with Shaw’s greatest
puppet, John Tanner, in “Man and Super-
man.” He played the part for long seasons
in the metropolis and the provinces.
“J.F.H.”: On Shakspeare Day (April 23)
there were juvenile prize-essay competitions
in a number of the London schools. One girl
wrote: “Shakspeare was the manager of the
Globe Theatre and acted there. Miss Marie
Lohr is now the manager of the Globe
Theatre, because women have taken men’s
places for the duration of the wax*.” Marie,
by the way, has been receiving many con-
gratulations on her first venture at the
Globe. The show has scored its 100th per-
formance and is still going strong. One
paper says that not since Marie Wilton
(now Lady Bancroft) took over the manage-
ment of the old Prince of Wales Theatre, 40
yearn ago, “has the playgoing public taken
so sentimental an interest in a theatrical
venture. As another venture at the Globe,
the Australian girl has settled upon a three<
act farce not yet named, but based by Robert
Hichens upon one of his early novels deal-
ing with London life.
The London acting-managers (those who
are left) are doing their bit of war
work. Amongst them H. B. li-ving has
“iixxportant duties” assigned to him at the
Admiralty. He is putting in an eight-hours’
day in the Intelligence Department.
George Robey was lately offered a record
price (equivalent to £lOOO a week for five
years), but contracts induced him to refuse.
Money is ixo object these days except to
soldiers, and, of course, they haven’t time to
spend it.
“P.”: They’ve introduced the Decammeron
to the stage at last. Six stories are to com-
prise the book for “Decammeron Nights,” for
which Robert McLauchlan is responsible.
Friend Howard Carr is a fellow conspirator
with the music as his job.
“Private Boxer”: Musical comedy at one
time invariably had a “girl” in the title.
Now “boys” are having a turn. The new
songandance sample which the J.C.W. firm is
staging in Sydney, called “Oh, Boy,” hails
from America. “The Boy” which is having
a long run at London Adelphi is purely Eng-
lish, an adaptation of Pinero’s farce “The
Magistrate.” It has been so successful in its
new guise that another of the author’s early
pieces is to be similai’ly used. This is the
34-years-old “In Chancery,” originally writ-
ten for the late Edward Terry.

THE PORTRAIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sweet Phyllis was the brightest bloom
In all the set they deemed exclusive,
A maiden tall and splendid, whom
The poets praised with rhyme effusive.
I painted her a tender dream,
All in a classic Grecian scheme,
“Be-utiful!” the women said—
It brought me not a crust of bread.
I painted her again, a rare
And radiant angelic vision,
\o touch of wordly cark or care,
And in her eyes a light elysian.
I hung it in a hall, there came
Each maiden friend and stately dame.
“How very sweet!” I heard them say—■
They looked at it, and went away.
I snatched my brushes in a rage;
Her arching brows I fashioned level;
I touched in lines of coming age,
And set a little leering devil
In her kind eyes, and made her smile,
A thing of faint, elusive guile.
Her dearest friend saw this, and she
A hundred pounds straight offered me.

per day, and the homely attention of the
Swiss doctors, to say nothing of the Swiss
girls, have fattened some of our lads out of
all knowledge.
“Croson”: As far as I can learn, the
Repatriation authorities, in Victoria at any
rate, have dropped the idea of persuading
Billjim to settle down on 2] acres to make
a living out of poultry, and are now send-
ing out small expeditions of “experts” to
look for orchards, etc., for the benefit of
the bewildered returned soldier. Recently I
collided with one of these examiners. He
was looking wise at a 10-acre block in an
essentially fruit-growing district that ‘ a
fruit-grower’s son wanted to settle on. The
land was cleared, but not planted, and the
youngster’s idea was to grow strawberries,
etc., while the trees were sprouting, as hun-
dreds of other selectors have done. After a
long scrutiny the expert expressed the fear
that “ten acres was a bit small for dairy-
farming!” The boy’s mother flew off the
handle and said angrily that anybody ought
to know that this wasn’t dairying country.
But his nibs was not disturbed. “Oh, but
he might fail at fruit-growing and want to
try dairy-farming,” says he. “There is a
good living in cows, you know.” So there
is. if you have £l2OO worth of good grass
land, £4OO worth of cows and £6OO worth of
house, implements, etc. The young man
didn’t get the block that he -would have pro-
bably made a success of.
“Army Artillery”; When Colonel F. A.
Hughes (“Gus”) returned recently to Aus-
tralia after three and a half years, one of the
best gunners Australia has, came home.
Hughes, who is a Bananalander, was
at the Landing, and his work was an
object-lesson. It is on record that he offended
every general he was under by his obstinate
battling for the rights of his men. He was
badly shaken by being buried under an earth
fall at Flers, and never really recovered. He
is only the shadow of the man we knew at
Gallipoli.
A fine young Australian, Lieut. Reg Aber-
nethy, who left with Grimwade’s lot of artil-
lerymen in November, 1915, has gone to
solve _ the Great Problem. Prior to Sydney
’Varsity, Abernethy was at the Wesley Col-
lege in the time of Grieve, V.C, Father is a
well-known solicitor in Goulburn Valley.
Right on the top of the announcement of
the death of Reg his brother Keith’s name
appeared amongst the fresh enlistments.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
DAVEID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, July 8, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
America in Sydney let itself go a bit on
July 4. There was no boasting. It. was
Governor Davidson who, at the cafe chautant
in the Australia Winter Garden, talked
about the quality of the American troops.
He travelled in a U.S.A. transport from
Sammy’s country to England, and had the
opportunity of gripping hands with stal-
warts from Missouri and Alabama. When the
silken folds of Old Glory were auctioned the
price mounted to a fancy sum amidst a stac-
cato chorus of “Gee!” The party was
arranged by the American-Australian League
of Help, and proceeds go to Australian
prisoners of war via our Red Cross. Con-
sul-General Brittain and his lady had a big-
tea party in the centre of the crush, with
the Davidsons as chief guests. A.D.C.
Saltmarshe put on his full-dress uniform
for the occasion. Guy Bates Post, whose
check suit deserves respectful mention, Mrs.
Guy in plum-colored velvet and white fur,
Margaret Wycherly under a big hat, Mrs.
R. 8. Winn and Mrs. Muston —American
League dames responsible for making much
of the candy that was fetching top prices—
Mamie Punch, who contributed to the musi-
cal programme, as did Mrs. Lorance Carter,
of U.S.A., who shook the Australia rafters
with the notes of “The Star Spangled Ban-
ner” ; and an American named Bourke. who
gave over £2OO for a gilt effigy of the ’Murkan
Eagle, were in a huge gathering. A handsome
cheque will go to buy food for Billjim in the
enemy’s prison camps.
Mrs..C. Hotham was the hon. organiser of an
amateur show which struggled with Pinero’s
comedy “The Schoolmistress” in the Reper-
tory the other night. How old-fashioned
the little play is nowadays is emphasised in
one line. “What, no moustache! and no
whiskers!” cries Gwendoline or Ermintrude
in horror, when young Reginald Paulover
appeared. W. B. Beattie was a pillar of
strength in naval uniform —John Strong and
hi. W. A. Kendall got through their parts
very well, and Mrs. Hotham was the school-
marm. Results go to Trafalgar Day orphan
fund—an unusual outbreak for a Svdney
amateur performance. Mrs. KingsmilfShaw
was responsible for the incidental music.
Major Clive Dangar, of the well-known
pastoral family, whose flocks are white on
many N. S. Wales hills, died in Melbourne
the other day after being invalided home
from the Front. He was only 80 and the
owner of the famous Gostwych station.
With the Light Horse he won the Military
. Cross in the Egyptian campaign. He mar-
ried his cousin some years ago—a sister of
Colonel Horace Dangar, formerly of the
R.A.A. and Chief of Ordnance, Melbourne.
Marie Narelle (Mrs. Currie) is still in
New York, and news comes of the swift rise
to fortune of her only son. His name is
Callaghan, of course, and, like his sisters, he
is .Australian-born. The young man got into
railway business, made good, and has now
followed up his luck bv marrying the
daughter of a U.S, millionaire.
Reported missing, Flight-Lieutenant Gor-
don Oxenham. An anxious father, Humphrey
Oxenham, of Neutral Bay, bows his head to
the sad message, “Believed to have been
killed.” It’s only a short time ago that he
had news of son Norman, who is a major
in the A.1.F., winning the D.S.O. for con-
spicuous gallantry in action. Both were old
Riverview College boys.
Australians in London who squeezed
through the official sieve got a home-sick
pang when the royalties streamed into
ancient Guild Hall to celebrate George
and Mary’s silver-wedding festivities which
recalled the toiir down under. That trip was
so soon after the old Queen’s death that
Wellington (then private sec. to Governor-
General Hopetoun) sent press representa-
tives a gentle hint that “the Court was in
mourning.” Black and white garb, or raven
drapery might, however, be resuscitated with
a dash of purple. It was my lot to wire
about a column of information daily to a
Sydney newspaper concerning the junketings
in Victoria. One morning as the Royal train
puffed into Ballarat the travellers saw what
looked like an epidemic of purple babies.
One embankment was top-dressed with a
section of the infant population escorted by
their adult relatives, in all shades from
mauve to the most blatant purple that ever
illuminated a bleak, grey day. Ballarat was
in mourning! After the York party had
been hustled through a mine shaft or two,
and had been driven (a fearful “perish”
judging by the blue tint of the York noses)
round portion of the freezing landscape, the
event of the day took place. George laid
the foundation of a memorial to local sol-
diers who had fallen in the Boer Wax*. Into
a deep hole the present King was assisted.
He was stiff from his box-seat ride; and
then came the Great Surprise. From that
small cold-crumpled coat-buried figure,
whose head and shoulders were alone vis-
ible, came a voice of such power and reso-
nance and language of such charming
diction that the crowd was mute with
astonishment. In ringing tones, the duke
made an (apparently) extempore speech,
short, statesmanlike in its intimate sym-
pathy with Australian sentiment, and alto-
gether amazing considering the position from
which it was uttered. Those who retain a
vivid memory of that day cannot doubt that,
later, in cold conventional surroundings,
George did make the “Wake up England”
speech off his own bat.
Pacific Commissioner Elliot and his wife
have finished their Australian holiday.
They’re off to the Gilbert Isles for another
snack of home life on the specks.
.Sydney beflagged itself last week and gave
a rousing welcome to its returned soldiers
and sailors. The Zeebrugge bluejackets (four
of them) were the idols of one section of the
crowd. Strong posts, with the Australian
girl in command, and the kiddies’ greetings
to “Daddy” gladdened the flower-strewn way
of the men eti route to the Domain Anzac
Buffet. The new liquor-prohibition blue arm-
band marked invalids who must stick to tea
till shell-shocked nerves get back to normal.
The battleplane for Britain, for which the
Women’s Reform League organised a High
Market (last Friday it was opened with a
flourish by Mrs. George Fullex*, and will con-
tinue for seven days), looks to be a blank.
“No more battleplanes for the British Gov-
ernment,” says the Defence Department.
Alma Baker, lion, organiser, who has no axe
to grind nor is in need of any limelight, is
replying with spirit. The controversy is
likely to end only one way—the end of a
fund which has already provided 35 Aus-
tralian air’-buses because there is objec-
tion to cash contributions being sent to the
British Treasury.
The sub-regal Davidson small girls, Daphne
and Diana, have as morning governess an
Australian, Miss Bedford. At playtime
they joy in our wonderful winter sunshine,
which is to them a summer warmth after the
xc;y climate of fog-bound Newfoundland.
Government House was mildly surprised to
hear that the youngsters were to be sent to a
> bool. Lady Davidson knows nothing of
the scheme. Perhaps it has been arranged
as a pleasant surprise for her Ex. by the
washerlady.
Two Melbourne musical representatives
appeared on Sydney concert platforms last
week. One was Elsie Davies, who sang at
the Phil Society’s evening in the Town Hall;
the other was the small-boy violinist, Cecil
larkes, who was included in Fred Collier’s
T op ’ on Saturday night, also at the Town
Hall—the first of the series.
Musicians are cut
on two patterns—
the self-assured and
the sensitive, self-
contained. Of the
latter type is the shy
little lady whose
photo, by Judith
Fletcher, you see.
The diffident Esther
Kahn was recently
coaxed out of her
den in the back
of Paling’s, and per-
suaded to give a re-
cital last week of her
ow n compositions.
John Browniow was
manager. Esther was
bo r n in England.
Her father was born
in Germany, but left that country as a mere
lad. Her mother was an Englishwoman.
The daughter came to Australia with her
parents soon after London critics had classed
her as “The Wonder-child.” That was
when little Esther at six years old had won
a scholarship at Guildhall for sight-reading.
This Qualification entitled her to three years’
free tuition in London, but as the Kahns
were packing up for Sydney the scholar-
ship could not be accepted. When the
family arrived in Australia the kiddy was
sent to Kretschmann’s studio, and that great
master nolished the gem. At 16 she wrote
“The Fantasie.” Then followed a song,
“My Lady Plucks a Red, Red Rose,” first
sung by Henry Weir some years ago. “The
Intermezzo,” for the piano, followed.
Kretschmann arranged a setting for the
violin. Paling’s soft! the English rights of
the composition, which has since been played
all over the world. It has made money for
everyone but the composer.
Lately there ar-
rived in Sydney a
heavy overcoat of
such importance and
of so suowfiaky a
pattern that it could
have come only from
New York. And, of
course, it did. In-
side it was Alex.
Sass, unmuffling his
impressions of five
and a half years that
he had spent with
Unci e Sam —and
very glad to be home
in Australia. Sass’s
impressions of
America were pleas-
ant and financially
satisfactory. T h e
black-and-white artist found room for his
skill on the New York World soon after
settling down in the big city. But the start-
off was misleading. “The editor,” says Sass
“looked at my work, said he liked it, and
then added that it was unsuitable for the
paper.” But the chance to do something
that upset that judgment came soon. For
18 months Sass supplied a daily cartoon to
the big journal. He has done a great
deal of color work in the States, and he has
had inimitable experiences in the fierce com-
petition of the rush of New York. “Physi-
cally, I froze in New York,” he says;
“last winter with • below-zero readings
there was a comparative famine of coal
and wood in the city, and now —well, look at
the sun yourself. Do yon wonder I’m glad
to be back in Australia!” The photograph is
by Judith Fletcher.
Ernestine Loiiat, a young singer, formerly
of Sydney, who married M. Parlongue, Chief
of the Forestry Department, and for a time
served with the Belgian army in the early
days of the war, writes a greeting from
Paris. “The authorities,” she says, “are
going to take all poor children and old people
out of the city. Hospitals—a sure mark
for the enemy—are being closed, and such
patients as can be moved will be sent to
comparative safety elsewhere. At the same
time refugees—a tragic spectacle—are pour-
ing in from the little villages behind the
firing-line... .My baby makes great progress.
She is a wonder at music (though I say it)
and plays amazing little things of her own
composing. Big Bertha dropped in on the
Boulevardo yesterday, and it’s clear that the
Devil (I mean the Kaiser) and all his hosts
mean to destroy Paris —if they can !”
Pianist Myrtle Meggy gave the first of
three recitals in the Conservatorium on Fri-
day evening. The accomplished ’cellist,
James Messeas, assisted. The programme
included an admirable performance of a
Bach Sonata.
In the non-competitive section of the Royal
Art Society’s Students’ Exhibition, Elaine
Coghlan (with two forceful black-and-white
studies) and.P. Eagles represented in the
same medium —well-drawn figures—eclipse
most of their neighbors. Amongst those
who have won prizes and scholarships, D.
Wilkinson is one of the promising youngsters.
Miss Jarrett was awarded first prize for a
poster with a strong patriotic motive.
Pianist Laurance Phillip, after many years
in Sydney, must leave. A dry atmosphere is
a necessity for this delicate musician, and
California is the place. In 1897 Phillip
made his first bow to Sydney with the old
Liedertafel—now the Apollo Club. There’s
to be a farewell gathering. W. Reginald
Gooud is looking after it.
■ Another music-maker, Laurence Godfrey
Smith, having been damaged in the firing-
line, is coming home to Sydney. A wife and
piccaninny will come as excess luggage. The
pianist went off to the war a lone bachelor.
One of this city’s Beatitudes, the Hospice
for the. Dying, needs help. That it will get
it goes without saying. The Lord Mayor
made an eloquent appeal to a meeting in the
Town Hall that had met to consider ways
and means, and he promised more tangible
support. A concert on August 15 will be
the magnet to draw as much cash as possible
into the money-box.
Passed through town the other day Miss
Frances Lysnar, a Maorilander who lias
spent the last few years in India, England
and America. She is the first woman to be
made F.R.G.S.
John Bassett Christian, who died last
week at Tudor—his Sydney home on the
shores of Elizabeth Bay—was wonderfully
young-looking and erect for his age—79
years. He had big station interests, but had
spent most of his later years in the city. Of
bis four daughters, one—the charming" Mrs.
Christian, who married a cousin of the same
name (a R.F.A. man), died in England
about IS months ago. Mrs. Antill, of War
Chest renown, and Airs. A Morris, are two
widowed daughters of John Bassett Christian.
Opinions are divided amongst war-workers
as to the wisdom of the Returned Soldiers
and Sailors’ League asking for an A.I.F.
Alemorial Day just now. Comforts Funds
arc getting hard-pressed to keep the man in
the firing-line found in little luxuries, of
which he gets too few, the Red Cross
wants all that can be spared, the War Chest
is becoming empty, and anxious guardians
of these feel that the erection of a costly
building as the official headquarters of re-
turned men, pending their absorption in
civilian life, might be postponed. However,
the League’s president. Alex. Jobson, has
had his way, and on August 1A all hands will
do their best for the Alemorial Fund. Syd-
ney voiced that decision in a big meeting
(mostly women) at the Criterion Theatre.
The Women’s Hospital in Crown-street
needs more help, so that smart young
business woman, secretary Mona Daley, tells
me. The institution had a big lift up this
year (the matinee in January put £6OO into
its lockers by way of starting 1018) towards
a new Nurses’ Home to replace the old
humpy, which is going to the scrapheap, and
now furniture is required.
The Bexley Voluntary Aid is taking off
her cap and pinny on Saturday night, July
13, to run a concert in the Conservatorium.
Proceeds go towards buying a car for the
convalescent soldiers at Rose Hall, the big
haven on the Darlinghurst hill.
Returned to Australia, Airs. G. AI.
Nicholas, whose husband, Alajor George Mat-
son Nicholas, D. 5.0., went west in Novem-
ber, 1916. As Hilda Rix, Airs. Nicholas
made a name for herself in art circles, and
during her residence in France was repre-
sented every year in the Paris Salon. She
will exhibit some of her work in Sydney
soon.
Mary Edwards, some of whose pastels are
in Aldenhoven’s Gallery, Hunter-street
(where, by the way, are samples of Airs. Ellis
Rowan’s gems of Australian flora), sends a
fevv words from Tahiti. “The British Con-
sul’s home here,” she writes, "is one of the
suburbs of Paradise. The walls of the home
are built partly of reeds; the roof is of
pandanus, and the furnishing of the rooms
is exquisite. For the outlook, the surf beats
on a cobbled beach. At one side there is a
river; cocoanut palms wave in the back-
ground, and far away is a glimpse of a coral
isle. Dr. Williams (the owner) and his wife
lent the big Oriental drawing-room in this
dream-bungalow to me to give an exhibition.
The result is that I have nothing left of mv
work worth mentioning to take away. And
commissions have flowed in ! The success
was due to my generous hosts, who did every-
thing possible to make the show a big event.”
Lieut. Furneaux Alann, who has been with
the British forces in France almost from the
beginning of trouble, has been awarded the
AI.C. He is son to Airs. Alann, who mostly
resides at Petty s. Before the gong roared
in Flanders he was taking a medical course
at Oxford./ A brother was killed while
attached to the-R.F.C., and a younger bro-
ther is giving a hand at Salonika.
Yours affectionately.

My first impulse was to buy a

entertainment of the family.
We met in town, my wife and
I, to make the purchase. 1
knew there were many makes,
but the first I heard seemed
good enough. To Irani or the

thought the next was as good
as the last. Then we heard

Melbourne, July 8, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Governor Stanley is said to be not anxious
for a fresh lease of his vice-regal job, which
demands little more, from a man than his
ability to “open” a bazaar. Even the butler
who opens the wine does something more
useful. His Ex. has urged the English Gov-
ernment more than once to allow him to
throw aside his cocked hat and roll up his
sleeves so that he can get into the Big Scrim-
mage somewhere, lie'chafes at being offici-
ally told in reply to keep on declaring
bazaars duly open.
The little Stanley ExJ is an adept with
a rifle. When she opened a new gallery for
the Ballarat Ladies’ Rifle Club her first shot
missed the bull by about the thickness of a
hair. None of the experts who followed
equalled her gun-fire, and she carried off the
trophy for the competition.
Mrs. Norman Falkiiier has just recovered
jrom the popular appendicitis ordeal. She
is recuperating in Sydney.
It happened at a starchy meeting at the
Austral Salon. Several returned soldiers
were present and a girl began to read
out an official list of contributions to a
comforts fund effort. When she intoned
* Gne cask of beer,” the grinning mate of a
one-armed soldier called across the room,
“There’s where you’d ha’ been, Wingy!”
Whereupon the cheerful Wingy retorted in
a stage whisper, “Now then, Jim, cut out
the rough stuff while the tarts is about.”
The Salon dames shuddered.
Philip Bussell's house, Carngham, has
been almost demolished by fire. It was a
huge place with over 40 rooms and the
scene of many tony house-parties in pre-
war days. Some fine pictures, pianos and
a quantity of silver-plate were destroyed.
The fire was still smouldering when news
came that Philip, who is serving in France
as a major, had been hit on the head with a
piece of shrapnel. Fortunately the wound is
not serious.
General Monash’s handsome grass-widow
has not enjoyed good health lately, and has
gone to Bendigo with daughter Bertha in
search of the missing article.
The Lyceum Club has moved and is now
sipping its afternoon tea in a luxurious
suite of rooms in the Auditorium. Since it
was hatched six years ago the membership
has jumped from 69 to 261.
Leigh Falkiner, one of the numerous
squatter brothers who went to Sydney to
buy sheep at the annual sales, had to drop
out and put in his time in a private hospital.
He was carried off from the Australia on the
second day of arrival.
Bobby Peel, from oversea (at present in
Sydney), has postponed his trip to the sheep
country up north. He is as tall as a gum-
tree, and nearly as tall as the yarn about his
celebrated ancestor.
That young bachelor, Rogers, is back from
America. While in New York he was stay-
ing at the Biltmore when the beautiful spy
woman, Nexie Storch, was arrested. His girl
friends are busily retailing the stories he
tells of the lady’s wonderful frocks. Some
men have a genius for such delectable
description; but not many men. (Most of
the queer sex could describe nothing more
interesting than a tin of whisky or a bottle
of tobacco.)
Victorian sheepmen, while at Sydney
sales, were interested in Watriama, king of
the Loyalty Islands, a breeder of merinoes
and very keen on improving the strain of
jumbucks in the islands where he monarchs.
H.M., who fought in France with the A.1.F.,
was invalided out of the service. He is a
very useful man, as kings go.
Veteran surgeon O’Hara, father of a family
of pretty daughters, now sees the O’Hara
good looks cropping un in grandchildren.
Mrs. Rowan (she was Eil.v of the clan) is
visiting Melbourne from Bananaland with
her chicks.
The Stoddarts (they belong to the Lane)
are back from a rush through U.S.A.
Eric Byron Moore, who has been holiday-
ing in Australia with his wife and child, is
steaming back to Siam. Mrs. Eric will
follow in a few’ months.
Woolgrower McPhail’s dark-eyed wife has
just got opt of a private hospital. She went
in for a fashionable nasal operation that
seems to have quite superseded appendicitis.
Amongst the racegoers who have poured
into the city are the Rajah and his Ranee.
With them is Mrs. George Long lnnes, who
was the musical Thelma McQuarle, of Potts
Point. Her hubby is known as the hero of
a thousand social engagements. Pretty
Pauline Curran is over from the Speck. She
is bereft of her fiance. Captain Fitz Gerald,
who is in England hunting up another active-
service job.
Early in the war Scotchbyterian parson
h rank Ingamells gave up his peaceful job
at Coleraine to go to the wars with the
A.I.F. Now he is home again after three
years’ service in Gallipoli, Egypt and
i ranee, a chaplain-major. He's had a couple
o? bouts of malaria and a full helping of
shellshock.
George Godsall, Rananalard’s most attrac-
tive bachelor, passed through Melbourne
during the week. He had been down to
W arrnjtmbool. and was piloting a sister and
her small family back to Bananaland for a
honday.
A somewhat remarkable woman died dur-
ing June in the Sydney suburb of W’ak-
roonga. This was Clara Elizabeth Morris,
wile of W. E. Morris, ex-reg.strar of Mel-
bourne diocese. She was a daughter of
Major French and was born in Berhainpur,
India. French was afterwards stationed in
Tasmania, England, and finally in Australia.
Clara’s mother, after many years of widovv-
h«(;d, married Dean Covvper, of Sydney.
Ilns opened a great sphere of usefulness to
Miss french, and the Dean said of her:
She is as good as a first-rate curate.” She
was married to Alorris at St. Andrew’s, and
continued her church work in Melbourne.
Before Melba left for America she promised
the natives of Coldstream, which ha-s its being
round about Coombe Cottage, that if they fur-
bished up the village she would present it
with a hall and library. As the diva drove
ii? on re turn last week her eyes were
delighted with a brand-new hamlet, all the
houses painted white and green in glorious
uniformity. As soon as Melba had unpacked
she took her family and John Lemmone to
eat luncheon at the inn, and now declares
that the cooking is good enough to delight
even the most fastid ous of motorists.
Colonel Francis Heritage, an old Mel-
bourman’ who has been in France in charge
ot the machine-guns, has been invalided home
with rheumatism. He is due this week.
Mrs. Heritage is not with him. She will
return to Australia later.
M |P ie ' Power,/after two years with the
Middlesex Hussars at Salonika, has hopped
back to London with one leg in a sling. He
met with an accident. You can hardly go
round a corner in Europe these days without
meeting with an accident.

S® 1 1** captain of the ill-fated transport
from her first trip as hospital ship—
practically three years’ service on the one
e t™ n sferred to his Common-
wealth billet. The Kyarra was torpedoed on
her first voyage after he left her. The same
record of service and «r o od fort,mo apnlies
to Jack Hamilton, The Bulletin’s occa-
sional briny contributor.
illiamson is the latest parson to
step into the ranks. He was Anglican shep-
heid at Broadford, and, finding that there
was no vacancy for him as a chaplain, he
enlisted as a private in the A.M.C. and is
now in camp.
Sister Kate Harden has practically four
years active service to her credit. She has
been tor a long period working on a hospital
ship, and l as now come ashore to nurse a
very sick Rilljim. When he’s back to health,
well— l U leave it to you to guess the happv
endme. Sister Knte is famous among the
boys for her unfailing cheerful kindness.
Dr. Glen Hickev was married in Mel-
bourne to Miss Rita Garran, of East St.
Kilda. and after the ’moon they are off
to ojuinnaJand. The young bridegroom has
gone into partnerslrp with two other doctors
a far-flung Darling l Dowms practice,
which they work from Toowoomba.
Mrs. Mina Moore Tainsh has introduced
another girl to Melbourne. The young ladv
is her brand-new daughter.
Lady Northcote’s Free Kindergarten is
still going strong. The building is at Ruck-
hurst-street, Montague, and Lady Stanley is
to preside at the annual meeting of ‘the
institution to-monwv (Friday) noon.
The man from Snowy River, in verv hand-
some numbers, has been do’ng his whack at
the Front, and his womenfolk at home are
helping him all they know. The Orbost dis-
trict. relying on a scattered population of less
than 2000> has just put through a cash-
ra.sing scheme, winch has adhed t2OOO to the
soldiers’ funds.
In the conduct of its marine store, by
which gold teeth, old brooches and the like
are turned into cash for soldiers’ comforts,
the L.M.P. League has the assistance of
dentist Joseph Levin and sheepman Sargood
as organisers. The pair manage what is
knowu as “the metals branch” of the League,
and they claim that the enterprise is now
hitting the liun with both barrels, since
the soldier gets comforts while the Aus-
tralian manufacturer gets much-needed sup-
plies of material. Levin fits very well into
the scheme, since he has a metals-refinery
of his own, besides being able to tell almost
at a glance the value of grandma's discarded
ear-rings or Aunt Mary's Marly Victorian
pendant. Some people would just melt the
contributions down and sell the bullion, but
the d.seeming Levin sends them farther
down Coilins-street if they are likely to
bring better prices unmelted. Sargood, too,
has the right sort of business head for his
job. The League has been collecting “rub-
bish” for a good while now; but lately val-
ues have gone up so much that members
feel it necessary to make a special appeal
to patriots not to forget Billjim when turn-
ing out old hoards.
A Melbourne stock and station agent has
a daughter who is keen ou reducing the
deplorable waste that goes on in Australia.
She lias a fearsome job ahead of her, but
every little helps. She and a girl chum take
a spring-cart once.a week and go out collect-
ing waste paper and old tins. In one month
they made £45 for the Bed Cross.
Marion and. Lulu xMontgomery are joint
lion. secs, for the Red and Purple Cross
Ball, on July 12. in St. Kilda Town Hall.
Marion, who is in charge, is organiser of the
well-turned-out Purple Cross horsewomen.
Both sisters went after a saddle as soon as
they could walk. They are daughters of the
late William Montgomery, of The Heart, a
cattle-ruri between the Snowy and Sale dis-
tricts in Gippsland. The Heart is the place
where, according to legend, a white woman
was seen with a tribe of blacks in 1842.
The French Red Cross commenced another
offensive on the pockets of Melbourne citi-
zens last week and will continue the “push”
until Saturday, July 20. The great day will
be next Wednesday. To help the rake-off
there will be an exhibition of paintings for
sale in the Upper Athenaeum Hall. It was
opened last Saturday, and will be on view
for a fortnight. Artists will be in attendance
daily ready to do portraits of human and
other animals. Pet dogs admitted free.
Our smart Equestrian Club is sore about
some recent criticism, knowing that much
of their labor goes unrecorded. Num-
byrs of the damsels belong to the
V .A.D.’s, who do unobtrusive war-work
with _ a scrubbing-brush and soap, or
toil in other menial occupations in the
hospitals. Some of the ladies turn up their
sleeves and grab a bucket after performing
their own household duties, and nearly the
whole club knits. A stack of over 1000
pairs of socks stands to the credit of the
members, beside some acres of scrubbed
floors, a Himalaya of washing, and towering
campaniles of clean crockery. The which
being so. the occasional appearance of the
Ind'ps on their geegees is a little piece of
frill” that i§ pardonable.
A noisy, well-dressed crowd turned up at
the Home Fires show at Melbourne Mansions
on July 4. Melba, in red velvet and a mole
tulle hat, made a speech, and American Con-
sul Magelssen thanked her nicely. Several
Melba students tried to soothe the mob with
song, but it wouldn’t listen seriously till
Stella Power lifted up her voice. Lady
Spencer fought her way to the tea-table and
broke the news that she was at last a grand-
mother. A cable had just come to Malvern
telling of the advent of a grand-daughter and
the promotion on the battlefield of father.
Dr. Constance Ellis, just back from the
States, had her own particular American
party, which included Emelie Polini.
, Tom Poekett, Australia’s best-known
chrysanthemum-breeder, hag given up his job
as curator of the Malvern parks and gardens,
a billet _ he has held down for 30 years.
I ockett is an Englishman, and Malvern looks
best m the spring and summer, when the
imported trees in the public gardens are out
m loaf and bloom, though of late years the
gardeners ideas broadened a bit, and lie in-
troduced a few jacarandas, flame-trees,
acacias and so on, with excellent results.
Ilis efforts in chrysanthemum-culture have
brought him wide attention, and gardening
peers pursued him for information when he
revisited England.
Squatter Findlay is looking for a high
peak in Australia whither to send his £2OOO
Rambouillet ram for change of air. The
ram_ and his w : fe were brought from 9000 ft.
un in the Rockies (U.S.A.) and must have
the mountain cold, so squatter Peter Mitchell
has offered Kosciusko, which overshadows his
station. Early Australian squatters tried
to introduce these French merinos, but the
heat knocked them out. Their heavy folds
of wool inspired The Bulletin shearer’s
protest that he was “paid for shearing sheep
—not a dashed concertina !”
The friends of poet Vance Palmer, now-
in knaki, plied lnmnvith wine and oratory at
Oxford Chambers on Saturday night, and the
wine at least was good. Edward Dyson read
a piece in praise of Vance; authoress Mary
Fullerton filled and drained the teacup of
eulogy on behalf of Mrs. Vance; Guido
Baracehi, wearing the picturesque robes of a
political martyr who has “done time” in
Pent ridge, dedicated his oration to the
Palmer kiddies; and the Rev. F. Sinclaire
added his quota in praise of their dad. The
dinner was arranged by Christian Smith
(one of our women barristers) and authoress
Katherine Prichard, but illness prevented
Kathie being present.
Before leaving Australia last time Melba
made a promise to sing to the Billjims at
Broadmeadows on her return. She is going
to keep the promise one day this week.
Geelong is busy patching its bunting in
anticipation of a visit from Melba. She will
motor to the hamlet on Monday \yeek, and
will preside over a concert to be given at
Her Majesty’s by Stella Power. Melba also
intends journeying to Sydney at the end of
the month to hear Stella when she warbles
there. She will follow on to Bananaland to
hear her pupil in Brisbane during the Show
week in August.
An enthusiastic Australian sends me a
catalogue of the exhibition of paintings,
drawings and etchings by Horace Brodsky in
New York. Brodsky is making a splash
there.
The decision of the Public Library Com-
mittee that “The Pen Drawings of
Norman Lindsay,” recently issued, were in-
decent and unfit for its shelves, spurred
Slowbart from its slumbers. The Govern-
ment nominees on the Board. Professor
Morris Miller, M.A., and ex-Speakcr Walter
Woods, members with well-known artistic
abilities, were alone in advocating the in-
clusion of the works of the artist on
ta ® catalogue. The objectors are ex-
officio members (aldermen), and, although
they _ may be experts in the art of
drawing the dog-tax, the public defiiands that
more classic qualifications should in future
be required. No complaint was made against
dozens of equally “indecent” artistic collec-
tions, including Hogarth’s works. Perhaps
being an Australian is Lindsay’s sin.
Genee is coming back to Melbourne “some
i -A- Us t ra dan has been raving about
the dancer’s London bathroom, which was
decorated by a noted artist. The lady bathes
surrounded by ducks, swans and sundry fowl
among reeds. Frogs are excluded.
Miss Edwards, a Sydney girl artist whose
work is well known in Melbourne, was saved
from the ill-fated Wimmera. She had been
painting in Fiji and the adjacent islands foi-
ls months, and was bringing some canvases
across for show in Australia.
A male star in one of the sassiety amateur
films complained to bis producer at a rehear-
sal: I wish this thing had more humor.
Gouldn twe get some fun into it?” “Don’t
you worry, old man,” said the producer,
you re d—n funny—the lot of you.”
George Benson, D.C.M., has just gained
Ins lieutenancy and been selected from over
ItMJ applicants to do the painting at the
Iront for .the Commonwealth Government.
Benson has done some good work for The
Bulletin, and had _ established a position
as_ a poster artist in Melbourne when he
joined the A.I.F. He has served with the
lying Corps, infantry, artillerv, navy and
Headquarters Staff, and his "skill as a
draughtsman _ proved useful before the Land-
ing at Gallipoli, when he made detailed
drawings from the deck of the Queen Eliza-
beth of the coast from Suvla Bay to Cape
Helles. He has been wounded three times.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
A silence that could be felt fell upon the
congregation at Flemington last Saturday when
Narahquong returned to scale for the G. N. Hurdle,
tin his previous running he had been deservedly neg-
lected in the betting. The double-event layers must
have had a skinner rightaway. Punters afterwards
remembered that the despised nag was at least a son
of Derby-winner Amberite and a grandson of Gar-
bine, and that his minimum weight had given him
all possible chance to cut 3jsec. off the time record
for the race. Moreover Narahquong was one of the
younger members of the company, though the owner
can’t swear to whether he is aged six or a year
older. The explanation of the surprise seems to be
that Narahquong was fitter than he had ever before
been. His light weight did the rest.
The four foremost nags at the finish, with
lengths between them, were Narahquong (9st.) Kin-
lark (9st. 101 b.), Pistolier (lOst. 41b.) and Fastolf
(9st. 91b.). These four, with Westendale, had looked
the most dangerous a mile from home, but as they
approached the last hurdle nothing but Westendale
looked likely to overhaul the runaway. He and
Kinlark were together. It was still possible that the
finish would be a repetition of last year’s coinci-
dence, when the two first horses in the Toolambool
Hurdle at Caulfield headed the poll for the National
a fortnight later. Kinlark, however, ran down his
hurdle as usual, and this seemed to worry Westen-
dale. Or perhaps the favorite was nearly ail out, and
an effort to fly the sticks was too much for him.
Down he went, anyhow, leaving Kinlark in an
assured second place. It was hard luck for backers
of the favorites to have their hopes of, victory and
their certainty of “place” consolation dashed to the
ground at the final jump. The same thing happened
to backers of Merunqua in the Australian Hurdle
last year—it) that s any consolation.
Two flat races following the National were won by
Bardol and Red Signal respectively, both horses
having been seriously thought of for “the big Hurdle
race a month previously. Bardol in particular was
spoken of as a rod in pickle for the G.N., and his
performance on Saturday suggested that if he ever
takes kindly to jumping he will be among the cham-
pions at the game. Not that there’s any big stake-
money to be picked up by a star hurdler these times,
the pace in the National on Saturday was killing to
the top-weights. Early in the race Greek Fire had
his head in front, and when the field turned the last
corner Jack Rice and Coronatus were in the first
dght, or so ; but they had no visible chance of out-
staying the lighter weights in front of them.
After the Narahquong turn-up pessimistic punters
will be shy of backing warm favorites for the Steeple-
chase next Saturday. Apparently there will be no
warm fancies, unless Booligal emerges from under
the cloud of doubt that covers him at present. He
and poor Old Mungin’di are in a class bv themselves
in moderate company, and this year’s field for the
National is very moderate, but Old Mung. isn’t a
starter. If Battleship should be among the final
acceptances the writer would as soon back that
nuggety pony as anything in the race. Thusfar the
horse has never been asked to tackle the V.R C
course.
* * * *
“Mujik” : Nearly all the newspapers were
busy on Monday remarking that the arrival of Narah-
quong was no good to the public.” Thev were
wrong again. If the public is capable of learning
anything’ this nag - s win should have been worth
quite a lot, lor the happening is an eloquent sermon
on tips. None of the tipsters gave this horse a
chance. And it doesn’t help them a bit to point
out that a nag they did give a chance to might
have won if he had stood up or that if another hadn't
ran second by mistake he might have won. The fact
is that any man who through a newspaper incites a
stranger to put money on any particular horse in a
race like the Grand National Hurdles has mighty
little conscience. If he knows anything about racin'*-
at all he knows (1) that the risk incidental to S
wager on such an event is tremendous, and (2) that
paper form, always a most unreliable guide in handi-
cap racing, is in the ease of hurdle races worthless.
Hie professional tipster must go on paper form
-on a balancing of weights and performances and
reference to track work ; and it is proved every day
of the week that the thing won’t work out on those’ lines
On paper Narahquong had obviously no chance. If
the misguided individual who takes the professional
tip seriously cannot get a coherent explanation of
why the tippers scored a miss he cannot hope to
collect next time the same sort of animal transpires.
“Carfax”: Lanius, list. 51b.. won the last
A.J.C. Plate in smin. 374 sec. Narahquong on Satur-
day ran the same distance over 15 flights of timber
in smin. 42sec. Lanius was ridden right out. The
lumper wasn’t. Now, taking the time test, it is up
to someone to explain just how much more vital or
courageous an animal the high-priced imported Lanius
is than this well-bred former station hack ; also, that
Narahquong would not have beaten Lanius, Wallace
Isinglass, Westeourt and Kandos in that race at
Randwick. What is a fair allowance to make for a
jump, anyway? Narahquong appears to have made
five leaps every mile and run the three miles at the
rate of M-jsee. a furlong. Rebus won last Svdnev
Gup by going two miles, without leaping, at a bit
worse than 12Jsec. a furlong. Lanius took the two
miles Cumberland Stakes at 13|>sec. a furlong. Unless
you make a miserly allowance for time occupied in
getting over the wood Narahquong’s effort looks the
best of the lot.
Lady Liddell, the little grey 14-handS
pony qhampion, ran into trouble at Rosebery (Syd-
ney) on Saturday. With 12it. 21b. on top she tried
to win the 14.1 handicap, 51 furlongs, all the way
—and failed because she wasn’t a head longer. Ellen
Moore, whose weight was 4cwt. and 31b. less than
the lady’s, beat her on the last stride. The same
afternoon Flying Arrow, another crack pony, carried
14owt. 21b. to the front over 5 furlongs. She ran
the distance in “34” which equals the record for
that track.
Taittersall’s Club meetings in Adelaide
lately have, been strangely lacking in the enormous
dividends at one time associated with them. Cer-
tainly at the last one no first favorite got home,
and there were healthy returns such as £l6 19s.
and £lB 25., and £0 12s. for a second place; but
there was nothing to approach the £BO dividends of
other years. As for VYestendale’s incredible return
of £lBl 10s. for a seiond, that stands alone and is
likely to do so.
* * * *
The two chief racing clubs in Adelaide,
S.A. Jockey Club and Adelaide R. C., have handed
all their profits for the year, respectively £2500
and £2OOO, or thereabouts, to patriotic funds. Both
have been doing well lately. Totalisator takings are
steadily going up to, or even beyond, the totals of
before the war, and entries are so numerous that
the split-into-two event is frequent. At the recent
Tattersall’s meeting, held at Morpliettville, the
jockeys talked of strike on being asked to crowd
in for a start of 30 horses in one event. They were
persuaded to get aboard, and nothing serious hap-
pened—nothing more serious, that is, than well-
fancied mounts getting all their chance extinguished
from the jump. The complaint is not likely to have
to be made again.
Westendale, now prominent as a jumper in
Victoria (not “Westerndale,” as commonly mis-
printed), has nothing eountryfied about his name,
Which refers simply to the liquor brewed by the S.A.
Brewing Co., of which the nag’s late owner, A. E.
Nott, was manager till retiring last Christmas.
When the co. was formed, just 30 years ago, out of
the rival businesses of E. T. Smith anil W. K. Simms,
it had the choice of the two breweries, and concen-
trated on the West End. The other, at Kent Town,
was reserved for malting, and it is still done there,
but of late years by the Barrett firm, as a branch
of their Victorian business.
“Backer”: Heard an owner advising the
boy on top that lie would find his nag awkward to
handle round the turns and to keep his eyes open
accordingly. The boy landed the bacon, a fair handi-
cap, and when questioned about the supposed vugaries
of the moke at bends drawled, “Gam, I could have
got him around a traybit.”
* * * *
M.L. cross-country rider S. Henderson, one
of those who got clear when the Wimmcra came to
grief over the Hun obstacle, was travelling towards
Melbourne to ride Glue Pot in the V.lt.C. Grand
National. The nag with the stickfast moniker died
at Flemington the day after the Wiintnera smash.
He lived long enough to learn that his old pilot—
whom he ferried to the front in the Great Northern
Steeplechase at Auckland in 1917—was o.k.
* * * *
“Hugh Stone”: Racehorses, particularly
jumpers, have been dropping dead with such regu-
larity in Masseyland of late that the occurrence is
losing the charm of novelty. While Fionnulla was
being schooled over the sticks up at Auckland the
other day his heart, not his legs, suddenly baulked
and down be flopped—dead meat. Then old Brae-
burn, a champion stick-clearer in his way, after
winning the Wanganui Steeplechase last month went
on to Napier and made a great up-the-straight
struggle to catch Collector, who eventually collected
the cheque for the Steeple. The old gelding was
second. He got the judge’s box, gave a heave
and collapsed. Broken heart? Perhaps.
“Trot”; Rubbing out the place-fielder was
an act of long-delayed justice, but by the Sacred
Grape this 12 3 tote business doesn’t look entitled
to continue. Take the proceedings at Rosebery (Syd-
ney) pony course on Saturday. Thirteen races and
numerous fields and 88 place dividends declared. In
20 cases the punter laid odds on, in five be got
away with less than he put in and in six of the
remainder he took 2 to 1 or less—mostly less.
Search of Ike’s documents might show that the public
got even worse than this at the old address, but I
don’t believe it. Anyhow, the thing only has to
keep going long enough and the public which wheels
up the spoil will be compelled to knock oil’ owing
to not having the trumfare to get to the locality.
“Billy T.” : Once upon a time a Melbourne
bookmaker, being deeply grieved at the conduct of
a young fellow (call him Jim Smith) who had frus-
trated a small, illegal, amorous romance of his, got
out two hirelings to beat Mr. Smith down into the
consistency of stale dough. One of the paid assassins
was (let us say) Bill Brown, a Christian running a
training-stable fer pugs, and another was Tom Jones
(as it were), a hard old welterweight who had fought
some scblanters in his day. Jim Smith was lured to
a suitable spot iri the Royal Park, and Bill and Tom
began to ply their arts. Presently Tom noticed that
Bill was nutting up so good a flight with Jim that
he could afford to assume the rflle of non-combatant,
so he stood out and looked on. Within five minutes
his old interests were deeply involved, ar.d he was
fairly revelling in the scrap. He constituted himself
referee, time-keeper, gong-beater and ten-seconds
ehrek, likewise the whole corner, including bottle-
holder, spray-blower and towel-flapper for his man.
His delight with the bloke’s showing was unbounded.
He tore the contestants apart every three minutes;
wildly he fanned his man with his own shirt; he
massaged him energetically, and pushed him into
battle again with frenzied glee, then went dancing
round the conflict, shouting injunctions to the
scrapper, thoroughly happv in his entire devotion to
the cause of the wrong man! Some time later Tom
Jones turned up at the bookmaker’s hack gate, with
something in a cart. Bookie went to see for himself.
The man in the cart was beaten to the bone. “But,
Gor’struth,” cried the bookmaker, “this is Bill!”
“Ves,” renlied the ingenuous pug. “He fouled the
other lad in the ninth round, and I finished him!”
“Dick L.”: How about anothei* player
getting into the Murrum school with “Con Drew”
(R. G/6/’18) and “Jim Carew” (B. 13/6/”18) ?
While the latter has been on the road for 25 years, I
have been exploiting every gambling game (bQth on
the level and otherwise) known to the human race,
and wish to intimate that the three broads and the
shells and pea are mere Sunday-school pastimes com-
pared with Murrum or any other game taat is played
with a peter. Surely .James knows that once the
implements are hidden from the view of players some-
thing happens. In a Murrum school some years ago
at, well, say, Sydney Town Hall, a bloke who had
been receiving low alleys with great regularity sud-
denly brought a shooting-iron into the game. Laying
the ironmongery on the table he casually observed
that the time was ripe for the marbles to take a
twist, lie got the 16 the next and last three shakes.
If “Jim” is trying to get a school going 1 won’t be
a nark and shelve it; but he put it up to me, didn’t
he?

The enterprising individual who transpires
occasionally .on N. S. Wales railway trains and
announces that he has just managed to escape from
a lunatic asylum was heard from again the other day
in the vicinity of Annidale, and, of course, when
he clumsily introduced an ace and a couple of pic-
ture cards all the other lunatics, noticing what a
chump he was, produced their wads and proceeded to
got away with the easy money. Naturally it was
the same old yarn. The allegedly demented gun
stripped them as bare as a lamp-post and apologeti-
cally departed at the next station to find his straight-
waistcoat or something. Meanwhile the despoiled
flats have been groaning heavily about the absence
in trains of John Hops. The truth is that they got
what they were looking for. It is a melancholy fact
that 50 per cent, of the population ought never to
leave home without a keeper.
* * * *
Featherweight champion Sid Godfrey had
a set-to over ten rounds on Saturday at Sydney Hip-
podrome with ex-champion Jimmy Hill, and he had
a long way from the best of it. James is a mercurial
person, disinclined to take things too seriously, but
he is a brilliant boxer. (Godfrey isn’t. It’s his
great wallop that counts for him, but this time
it landed on the atmosphere. Certainly he did most
of the attacking, but James’s exhibition of how to
foil an attack by not being there to take it was
scientifically accurate. Wherefore judgment went for
Hill.
* * *' *
Harold Hardwick, who headed for the
battlefields the other day, won Australian swim-
ming championships from 100yds. to a mile. In
England, in 1911, ho was first in the 100yds. cham-
pionship of the Empire, and 100yds., 220yds. and
440yds.. English championships. Hardwick was one
of the Australian Olympic team which won the 880
metres championship at Stockholm. On one of these
trips he carried off an amateur boxing championship
in England. In later years he pulled on the gloves
at Sydney Stadium, but found the job of knocking
edges off professional pugs fairly hard work. Harold
was much too affable for that sort of game, anyway,
and got knocked himself with great emphasis. The
6ft. of him filled out a lot in camp.
“The Nark”: Last week a coursing con-
ference was held in Sydney. The delegates present
were Dick Coonibes, L. Fowler (N.S.W.), Martin
Taylor (M.L.) and F. W. Stockwell (Q.). ijhey met
earlv, and at a late hour announced that it had been
decided to form an Australasian Coursing Union, and
that a constitution therefor had been adopted. It
was also resolved that an Australasian Waterloo Cup
should be run annually, the first to take place at
Sydney next year. For the present the headquarters
of the Union are to be in Sydney, with Coombes as
president and Fowler as hon. see. All this seems to
mean a lot in print—but in actual fact it really
doesn’t amount to anything. Maoriland’s represen-
tation at the conference means nothing. Martin
Taylor is in Sydney each winter, and is always pre-
pared to represent anything. With regard to Banana-
land, there is not much coursing done there these
times, and, anyway, the class of dog up there is very
ordinary. The idea of having a Coursing Union for
Australasia is an obsession with Dick Coombes, the
N. S. Wales National Coursing Association’s presi-
dent. He has advocated it in and out of season, but
has always had to notice his scheme falling in a
heap owing to the ounosition of Melbourne and South
Aus. This year neither Victoria nor South Australia
was represented at the conference. Still that is not
to be wondered at. The action of the N.S.W. N.C.A. ■
in refusing to endorse the disqualification imposed by
the South Australian governirg body on A. B.
Cowell and endorsed bv the Victorian governing body,
has only served to widen the former breach.
* * * *
The iCastralian Waterloo Cup, run last
week on the Woodstoc k enclosure at Rootv Hill
(N.S.W.) attracted only 32 runners. For this the
entry of Beauty Spot was mainly responsible, as
owners were not anxious to put their dogs against
Bennett's champion. Consequently at the calling of
the card Beauty Spot was a hot favorite at 5 to 4
against, straight out. She was drawn against
Achieved, winner of the Metropolitan Cup at Liver-
pool, and to the surprise of evervone but the Achieved
kennel, Beauty Spot was beaten easily. For the
course, Achieved started at 3 to J against, but the
moment be won he was made a hot favorite for the
stake. This he duly won —but tile job was made
none the easier by losing three toe-nails during the
proceedings and running the last two courses with
two of the remaining nails badly split. But he ran
with the greatest gameness throughout, and being
easily the fastest dog in the stake never looked like
being beaten after the first round. The runner-up
was Quair Hone, a Victorian-owned dog, which ran
fairly well right through. A feature of the meeting
was the large number of dogs that got crippled.
This was due to the ground being like iron. No
rain had fallen at Rooty Hill for months. But what
was the tykes’ misfortunes was good luck for the
hares. They ran like stags. Only five were killed
during the two days.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.”: Lately-dead William Caffyn (B.
4/7/T8) came to Australia with Stephenson’s team
imported by Spiers and Pond. The first match was
played at Melbourne Cricket Ground on New Year’s
Day, 1862. Caffyn returned with the second English
XI, Parr's, which included Dr. E. Grace. The first
match this team played was on New Year’s Day,
1864. When the team left Australia in the Bombay
on April 26, Grace remained behind to visit
friends, and Caffyn stayed under an engagement to
the Melbourne Club, and was absent from England
for seven years. After 12 months in Melbourne he
induced the M.C.C. to cancel his engagement to allow
him to_ commence business as a hairdresser (his
trade) in Svdney. His first shop was on the south
side of Hunter-street, next the Tavistock Hotel, which
was five doors from Pitt-street. His next stand was
in George-street, next De Josselin’s Cafe, near Wyn-
yard-street. In the first ’seventies John Campbell
"(of Campbell and Graham, theatrical wig-makers, of
Melbourne), who came to Sydney with a waxworks
show and opened in Pitt-street where now is the
Imperial Arcade, bought Caft'yn out, sold the wax
figures to Gourlay, the Scotch comedian, and carried
on the barbery until he made a pile. Caft'yn did not
make a pile.
Talking about Spiers and Pond and Caft'yn, Mallam,
book-keeper to S. and P., was sent to England to
procure the best eleven that he could. He might
have got a better lot. but some of the best players
declined to make the trip. Each man was guaranteed
£l5O and first-class exes. The 12 selected steamed
out in the Great Britain, and on arrival in Hobson’s
Bay S. and P. went aboard and presented an address
of welcome. A four-in-hand was in waiting and the
strangers, each wearing a white pot-hat decorated
with a blue ribbon, were driven to the Cafe de Paris.
Next day they were smuggled off to a private pitch
out Heidelberg way to practise on the quiet. Later
they became more public in their practices. The
first match lasted four days—Gate, as usual, being
the main object. The Englishmen won by an inn-
ings and 00 runs. There was a sweepstake in con-
nection with the first match, the first prize being about
£lOO. The highest scorer in the game was Caft'yn,
and the holder of his name in the sweep passed him
a tenner off the wad.

The fleet-footed Harold Holder (South
Sydney) is doing big things in N.S.W. Rugby League
this season. He stood down in two matches, and
in the other half-dozen has scored 10 tries. On Satur-
day he galloped through Balmain and crossed the
line three times. He is easily the best all-rounder
playing for the League this year.
“Bob” Craig (Balmain), who is prancing
round like a two-year-old in Rugby League matches
this season, is the oldest of N.S.W. rep. footballers.
Robert was a giant in the Rugby Union nearly a
score of years ago, and hopped with the Wallabies in
England in 1904. At one time Craig was a top-
notch swimmer, and won N.S.W. 100yds. champion-
ship (in ’99) and 440yds. (in ’O4). On Saturday the
wily old performer romped through lusty South Syd-
ney and put a try on the score-sheet.

Merrick (East Sydney) put some sparkle
into Australian Rules football on Saturday when he
recorded the best individual effort of the season —
eight goals against South Sydney. Easts won by
121 points to 13, and up to the last quarter had
the staggering score of 90 points to nil. South Syd-
ney must be getting accustomed to hobnailed (trash-
ing® Newtown trampled them into the earth the
previous week-end by 137 jjoints to 41.

Motor-cyclist H. A. Parsons added
another to his array of records last week when, in
climbing 7-10ths of a mile up Wheeler's Hill (Vic.),
he knocked Jack Booth’s figure down. Parsons made
the time 38 3-ssecs. He holds world’s records for
10 miles (7min. 25 l-ssec.), 25. miles (22min. 9 2-5
see.), 50 miles (44 min. 35 2-ssec.)> 200 miles
(3hr. 20rnin.). He has also tried the Melbourne-
Sydney whiz, but there must have been a cross-eyed
Chinaman about when he pushed off.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdjjll, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
ot superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, hut how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered phemiuol may he
applied directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, hut to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
ot pheminol. obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
complexion out of a bud one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skin from the face. This can
be done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mercolised wax from your
ehejnist and apply it,at night like eold cream,
washing it off in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
nave a beautiful, clear, natural complexion,
l lie process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan. moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
keep a little mercolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best com-
plexioned beautifier and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to drop a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has snb-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. Cut to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable .to repeat the treatment several
tunes at intervals of say about four or five
• days.
Grey’Hair Unnecessary.
One need, not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. * The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natural color in a few
days time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
. ounces of tammalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Applv
this to the hair a few times with a small
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
ot seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to. the desired shade. The lotion is pleasant,
not sticky or greasy, and does not injure the
hair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but lias the peculiar property of
leaving the hair with a pronounced natural
wave, an effect presumably desired by many
aclies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of bot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
a Peculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes onlv in
to ■"-'si

The human body is aelf-rcgrl-’tine- and self-

eat drink, breathe, bathe, recreate, re t and sleep, as
Nature intended, is to lay a sure and solid founda-

capacity.
.After suffering for 25 years from Dyspepsia, Con-
stipation and Nerve Prostration I learned how to
remove the causes of these maladies, and thereby
enabled Nature to restore me to robust health and
full capacity.
You can do likewise by adopting the same means.

Have Nerve, Not Nerves,
In. these war times many people are liv-
ing. in an unnatural condition of nervous
excitement. Unless something is done to
correct it the inevitable result will be a
nervous breakdown, an exhaustion of ner-
vous energy that may take a very serious
and unforeseen turn.
Neurasthenia is one such result, with
its accompaniment of worry, irritation, over-
sensitiveness and severe headache. It
means that the patient has lost the power to
recover and store np energy. The condition
will grow worse if not corrected.
The treatment is one of nutrition of the
nerve cells, Requiring a non-alcoholic
tonic. As the nerves get their nourishment
from the blood the treatment must be
directed, towards building np the blood.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills act directly on
the blood, and with proper regulation of
the diet have proved of the greatest benefit
in many .cases of neurasthenia. A tendency
to anaemia, or bloodlessness, shown by most
neurasthenic natients, is also corrected by
these tonic pills.
Sufferers from nervous disorders who
have been taking treatment without benefit
should investigate the tonic method. Write
to-day to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co..

STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it oil the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “‘cures'’ and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by

Does the winter mean
bronchitis for you ?
BECAUSE it has done so in the past is no reason
why you should suffer in the future. Bronchitis,
as well as other bronchial affections, can be
warded off by the timely use of
/f'CaAKI CD (SOILED MR
% COUCH RCMCBT 9
To keep yourself in health and
free from bronchial troubles
never be without a bottle of
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.
At the very first symptom of a
cold, or even when the weather
is unusually severe, take a few
doses of this wonderful medicine.
Not only will it ward off the
attack of bronchitis but its tonic
properties will tone up the muc-
ous membrane of your throat
and make it less susceptible to
coid and change of weather.
Ifyour child is subject to bron-
chitis you can saveit much suffer-
ing in later life if you will start
now and give it Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy.
Every attack of bronchitis
weakens the bronchial tubes and
by preventing them you give
these organs the chance to be-
come strong and resist disease.

BE PREPARED
Like many other dangerous maladies diarrhoea often conies on unexpectedly and frequently
before the patient is aware of it some serious disorder Ins developed. During the warm
weather attacks of this kind are very frequent and often so swift in their results that life is iu danger before the physician
can be summoned.
Those who have the interests of their family at heart keep a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy on
band for immediate use in cases of this kind. It is without doubt the best medicine prepared for diarrhoea, dysentery and
other disorders of the bowels. If given at the first unusual loosenessof the bowels the attack may be avoided but even in
advanced stages it is a quick and most effective remedy.
Never leave home without a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in your luggage. The excitement
incidental to travelling and change of water and food often bring on diarrhoea, coiic and pains in the stomach for which
speedy relief must be obtained and Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy can always be relied upon to do this.

P. AIREY.
•‘Peter” : The excited person who wants to
know why the war isn’t finished oil-hand
from the air might well consider some of the
difficulties in arranging an overwhelming
offensive. Up to the intervention of the
Yanks the Huns could match our most
strenuous efforts in production, but found
like us that their air strength was limited by
the scarcity of personnel. It was not only a
matter of pilots and observers, but also the
highly competent mechanics who tend the
'plane on the ground. When one remembers
that every engine must be completely over-
hauled every 75 hours, and that each ’plane
must be minutely inspected and tested and
repaired when necessary before each flight,
lie is not surprised to learn that every
machine is the constant care of 4(j hands.
.Multiply 4(J by 2500, the average muster of
allied ’planes on the Western Front, and
you have a fairly respectable army of experts
whose value is enhanced by continuous wast-
age through sickness, accident and occasional
bombs. The maintenance of this force is a
big enough job at any time, but increasing it
to the extent which would be entailed by
regular attacks on open towns and still leave
enough machines for the front line services,
would probably be beyond the resources of
any power but U.S. No doubt Uncle Sam
will eventually ease the strain, but the pre-
parations have not been a picnic. Some idea
of Sam’s position may be gained from Secre-
tary Baker's confession that as recently as
March this year the Yank’s largest sector at
Sf. Mihiel, near Verdun, was so short of
aerial protection that Gothas had selected the
locality for egg-laying competitions.
These are hard times in the land of the
Prophets. The Palestine News bears the
evidence in this advertisement: —

Visitors will greatly oblige the Management bv

Pension 4o P.T. per day.
45 P.T. is equivalent to 9s. Ud., and not
even the four virgin daughters of Philip the
evangelist, who prophesied, ever gave a hint
that a wayfaring Christian would have to
shell out to that extent and provide his own
bully-beef.
Ou the grounds of the Charles Ruwolt
foundry at Richmond, Melb., there is
a mighty dredge, of some 1250 tons weight,
waiting for shipment to Siam. It was made
to the order of the Assam Kumbang Tin-
dredging Co., and as the production of tin
is a matter of Imperial concern these times,
ship space is promised. The huge outfit,
which looks very like the skeleton of a ship
in dock, is a notable achievement in Aus-
tralian hardware manufacture. It is the big-
gest dredge ever made for tin-getting. The
manufacture of dredges is Ruwolt’s specialty,
but the demand for the implements is not
brisk of late, and the foundry is asserting its
usefulness in other lines of industry. Boilers
for the three Commonwealth ships are being
made at the foundry under contract with the
Babcock and Wilcox firm. No such job, pre-
sumably. would have come Ruwolt’s way
before the war began to cast Australia on her
own resources, and what now worries the
enterprising manufacturer is the doubt as to
whether the local producer is to be safe-
guarded by the Government when war condi-
tions protect him no more.
One of the makeshifts of industrialism is
the demand made to Federal Minister Poyn-
ton that coal should be further “diluted” to
make more work for miners and wharf-
lumpers. “Dilution” means mixing poor
coal with good coal, so that buyers may
have to use more of it. Of course “diluted”
coal is cheaper as well as worse, so the dilu-
tion doesn’t matter much to the people who
live next door to the mine. But it makes
a lot of difference to, say, the gas con-
sumer in Adelaide or San Francisco, if he
has to pay freight on twice as much New-
castle c-oal in order to get a light, and it is
no joy to him to know that he is employing
twice as many coal-lumpers between strikes.
The exports of coal to foreign countries are
now less than a third of what they were in
1912, partly by reason of big strikes and
partly for lack of the ships we don’t build,
and a reduction in the average quality of the
article might kill the trade that remains. It
is primitive logic which proposes to sandbag
the third customer because we have driven
away the first and second.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
'its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

An Australian Actress Praises
DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY.
Miss Tien Hogue, one of the
prettiest of our young actresses,
comes of a family notable m
Australian history. Her father
was for many years Minister
for Education in New South
Wales, and her brother is
the well-known military cor-
respondent “Trooper Blue-
o-um.” Miss Hogue has won a
place for herself in the hearts
of all Sydney theatre-goers,
and is now appearing as Ellen
Trent in “The 13th Chair”
at the Criterion Theatre. This
charming New Discovery Girl
writes as follows: —
I liave been using Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery
during the last three
weeks, with most marvel-
lous results, and I have
decided that 1 would write
and tell you, for it was
not until this year that I
ever had occasion to try it.
For many years each
winter I was troubled
with throat trouble or
colds. I used to always
have a recipe at the
chemist's that was given
to me by a friend of mine.
This always seemed to
help me a good deal, and
I thought it was about as
good as anything I could
get.
Unfortunately (as I
thought at the time) I lost
this recipe, and when I
had the misfortune to con-
tract a bad cold this year,
which affected my voice
seriously, I could not ilnd
this recipe, and I was
recommended to try Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery
by a friend, who said she
had used it with great
success. I obtained _a

A Garden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERE must be some safe place
I nearby—
JL Some quiet place where dead leaves
pass
In slow, red shadows down the sky
And lie like faded rubies in the grass;
There all tired things must be at peace,
And old, sad eyes must no more weep ;
All pain and dreams and labor cease
In rest, and shaded calm, in warm, safe sleep.
Sweet sleeping violets are there ;
And tall white gum-trees tower tip
Like moonlight painted on the air;
And in the deep grass dreams the buttercup.
There is a wood, where raindrops lapse
In droning murmurs on the stream,
Where, underneath the banks, the caps
Of pixies shine, like harebells all adream.
Seme drowsy bees go singing by ;
And chestnuts in a red-brown pile
Wink sleepily, and faintly sigh
For scarlet roses dark, that nod and smile.
The place is wrapped in noontide haze.
The rustling roses and the bees
Are shadows of remembered days;
And memories of olden nights the trees.
And no heart living knows the gate
And no heart dead ; only the eyes
Of weary souls can see, who wait
Long years for some white, unknown dawn
to rise.
Their garden hangs from Heaven’s floor,
And Faith and Hope and Charity
Stand young-eyed ever l” the door;
And Rest and kindly Death wait patiently.
n.s.w. Hilary Lofting.
“Home Service."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Augustus woodmylk
clicked liis heels together, executed
his best salute, and reported his arri-
val for duty at Camp 105, Mudhurst, Salis-
bury Plain. The C. 0., a truculent little old
man with porcine eyes and a vast, formless
nose, went on writing; the Adjutant re-
marked coldly: “You are posted to No, 4
Unit. That will do, thank you. Mr.
Woodmylk saluted again and withdrew.
Though young in years he was old as a
soldier. Within an hour he had secured an
efficient batman; chosen a room m a hut;
and “souvenired” a bag of coal and one or
two essential articles of furniture. Seated
in somebody else’s chair, before his c is-
honestly-acquired fire, he decided that the
place mightn’t be so utterly rotten, after all.
In the ante-room he found James Bab-
chick, now marked “C” class.
“What sort of a show is it, Jamesy ?” he
asked.
“Poisonous,” replied his young fLiend,
gloomily. “Everything’s wrong with the
dam’ place ; but chiefly it’s the Adjutant and
the C. 0.”
“Any decent town near?”
“Yes, but you never get there. The last
parade isn’t over till five, and they have a
compulsory lecture every night after dinner.
A feeling of depression began to. creep over
the new arrival.
“Food good?”
“Putrid.”
“You do buck one up,” said the other
feebly, as they filed into the mess-room.
After the evening meal, and a haitm & dis-
course on “Sanitation in Billets” by a scor-
butic lad, who ruined any slight chance he
might have had of holding his audience by
admitting, at the outset, that he had not yet
lived in a billet, the junior officers began to
fade away. , . . ~
“I think I’d rather be back in the line
than this.” „ , _. , ,
“You’ll say so before you’ve finished, my
lad,” replied Babchick, darkly.
At 10.30 the next morning, Augustus,
having handed his detachment over to a ser-
geant, made off along the high road winch
bordered one side of the camp. He felt as
if he had escaped from gaol. Before him
stretched a level causeway of inch-deep slush.
He plodded on. After half an hour or so he
turned and plodded back again. As he
reached his quarters an orderly appeared.
“The Adjutant’s compliments, Sir, and you
are to report at once at the Office.”
In the Office were the C.O. and the
Adjutant. The Adjutant eyed Mr. Mood-
mylk inimically.
“Where were you during parade-hours,
Sir?” he inquired. . . , .
It was clearly a case for the naked truth.
“I went for a walk,” he said.
“Did you get permission from me?”
“Permiss” *
“Answer my question, Mr. Woodmylk.
Did you, or did you not, get permission from
me?”
“I never”
A raucous cry burst from the Colonel.
“Why the don’t you answer, man?
Answer, G—d d-n you! Answer the
question, I say !”
“I don’t” —■ —
There was a scream, as of one m pain.
“Yes or No!” howled the C.O. thrashing
the table. “O my God, that there should
be such officers ! Yes or”
“I never got permission !” shouted Augus-
tus, desperately.
There was a ghastly pause.
“When you address your Commanding
Officer,” said the Adjutant, “you will say
‘Sir’ and stand properly to attention. Stand
properly to attention this instant, Sir.’'
Augustus leapt distractedly to a more
attentive position.
* *. * *
He left, a quarter of an hour later, feeling
as though he had been put through a mangle.
“Is that their ordinary form?” he asked
Babchick, after supplying a blasphemous
word-picture of the episode.
“Absolutely. If anything, they let you
dow T n rather" lightly.”
“How does one get out of. this infernal
place—l mean back to France?”
“You don’t get out.” said Babchick. “I
know, because I've tried.”
At five o’clock that afternoon, the parades
being over, Woodinylk went, in all good
faith, for another walk. In the course of a
further official interview he was informed by
the Adjutant that he had broken the Stand-
ing Orders, which laid down that no one
should leave the camp at any time without
getting permission and signing his name in
a book provided for the purpose; and that
further conduct of the sort would land him
in serious trouble. The 0.0. mentioned that
lie was evidently not only an insubordinate
young scoundrel, but a fool as well, and
that the whole army was degenerating into
a rabble.
Detailed as Brigade Orderly Officer, next
morning, he omitted, on the 9.30 parade, to
dress the markers and get the Unit Com-
mander’s reports. A piercing cry from the
neighborhood of the 0.0. indicated that some-
thing was wrong. The Adjutant shouted tor
him—“at. the double, Sir!” —-and pointed out
his offence after the style of a generalissimo
addressing one whose criminal error has
caused the annihilation of a regiment.
“I’m sorry, Sir.” said Augustus, amiably.
“1 thought that was the B.S.M.’s job.’
The Colonel executed a brief step-dance
indicative of stupefaction.
“You thought?” he yelled. . “G —d d —n it,
who told you to think ? What right,
have you to think?” ,
Augustus was still in a semi-stunned con-
dition when, his duties being over for the
morning, lie encountered his friend Bub-
chick. ./id
“Tell me, Janies.” lie said, “what m God s
name is the meaning of it all? Why do they
do it? What are they?”
“Ex-sergeant-majors,” said Babchick.
“And they’ve neither of them seen five
minutes’ service in the field in their lives.”
The experienced Mr. Woodmylk saw the
situation with dreadful clearness.
“There’s only one thing for me to do,” lie
said, “and that is to imslii oil as soon as I
can. Give me Tasschendaele in preference
to this any day. I shall parade to be put on
draft as soon as I can fix it with the M.O.
The doctor was complaisant, the Colonel
was not. A certain type of ex-sergeant-
major remains instinctively obstructive,
automatically offensive, to the end; and such
a type, precisely, was Lieut.-Colonel Howl,
V.D. When Augustus made his request he
was told by the Adjutant that lie had yet to
learn the first duty of a soldier —namely,
knowledge of, and obedience to, the King s
Regulations—that liis lack of interest in the
work of the Brigade had created a highly-
unfavorable impression, and that he would
stay where he was. The Colonel mentioned
vigorously that he would be attached “foi
instructional purposes” to Mr. Slyme (the
youth who had lectured on sanitation), and
that “when he had learned the work,” lie
would do a fortnight on end as Brigade
Orderly Officer.
Mr. Woodmylk retired in a thoughtful
frame of mind. Clearly something urgent
needed to' be done if he was not to have a
massacred adjutant or colonel upon his soul.
Though somewhat fatuous, as regards his
appearance, Lieutenant Woodmylk by no
means lacked resource. His first step was
to get a copy of the King’s Regulations. He
studied the book until late into the night:
he continued to study it while he shaved and
dressed next morning, and all through the
day which followed —an unspeakable day
spent peering at blankets and boots and
masses of raw food with a detested com-
panion—the famous manual was in his
thoughts.
* * * *
The arrival of his first official Report in
the Clerks’ Office caused the same sensation
as though a mine had gone up. By break-
fast-time it had been read appreciatively by
every subaltern, N.C.O. and clerk in the
camp. In the space left vacant for Remarks
appeared the following :
I would draw attention to the prevalence of
Gambling in this Brigade, in defiance of King s
Regs., Para. 459. Entering the Ante-Room, at
various hours between 8.30 p.m. and Tattoo, I found
Bridge and Poker in progress, and likewise a game
of chance, analogous to pitch-and-toss, known, I
believe as “Vingt-et-un, with variations.” Sums of
money passed, and there was a good deal of Cursing.
The Gambling was confined to senior officers, one
table consisting of two Field Officers, a Captain and
the Adjutant. The gambling continued after “Lights
out.” The windows of the Ante-Room were not
shaded, as required by the Defence of the Realm
Act. The Gambling and Cursing were in progress,
the lights were burning, and the windows were still
unshaded when I retired to my quarters at 11.15
p.m.
Lieut. Woodmylk had the place of honor
at Orderly Room that morning. “And now,
Sir,” cried the Colonel, epileptically, as he
entered, “will you explain the meaning of
this tomfoolery?” and he agitated the
Report in the air.
“Which tomfoolery, Sir?” inquired the
young man respectfully.
“Which! D—n it, you know which and
what and all about it! I mean this—inso-
lence about gambling and lights and cursing.
Wodderyermean by it? Hey? Answer,
you!”
The attitude which Mr. Woodmylk adopted
was that the heavens might fall, but he
would do his duty and expose infractions of
the King’s Regulations wherever he saw
them occurring. He pointed out how dis-
tasteful it was to him even to appear to
criticise his superiors, but that, in this
matter, the call of Duty gave him no option.
He would have been guilty of an offence
under those Regulations which were more to
him than life itself had he acted differently.
The C.O. continued to pour forth impreca-
tions, but he was evidently baffled. The in-
terview ended in a kind of stalemate. The
backlash got the Adjutant. No sycophancy
however abject, no flattery however rancid,
availed to soothe the infuriated old parade-
ground warrior. The Adjutant could not
recall having endured so many insults in one
day since, as a ranker, he had been the bane
of the sergeants’ mess.

DON'T NEGLECT
15 El SISC
Rub ZAM-BUK In & Avoid
Winter Skin Troubles.
I The skin is one of the most sensitive parts
of the human body; and because it is also the
most exposed to injury and disease, it ought
t° get more attention than most people think
is necessary.
A sudden chill, dirt in a cold-crack or small
abrasion, and skin-weaknesses are all likely
to lead to trouble. Neglected chafings,
“chaps,” chilblains, cold-sores or
ruts may also cause more serious
disease in the shape of festering
wounds, ulcers or itching sores, and
even chronic eczema is often trace-
able to neglect in the early stages of
a simple affection.
hfeal application
for the skin at this season.
>o ordinary ointments or salves,
concocted from rancid animal fats of
mineral irritants, can do for the
skin what Zam-Buk does. Such
coarse and harmful preparations
never give lasting satisfaction—the
sort that is undoubtedly got from
rubbing in Zam-Buk.
, m< ' u b»g ibe skin with Zam-Buk has an almost instantaneous
leansing and restorative effect. So pure are the juices in Zam-Buk
nat they sink deep into the pores, permeating all the minute
~o f the tissue, and they just go to work right away to end
tne trouble thoroughly.
No s_kin looks so well—or is, in fact, so soft, sound and healthy
throughout—as the skin that has had frequent dressings of Zam-Buk.
And this perfection is more than “skin-deep,” seeing that a healthy
skin exerts a wholesome influence upon the rest of the body.
THE EVER-READY HOME HEALER. 1
Zam-Buk is excellent for eczema, ulcers, ringworm, bad legs, rashes, erup-
tions. pimples, sores, scabs, scales, piles, pains, swellings, chapped hands, sore
races, cold sores, chilblains, cuts, burns, festerings, gatherings, poisoned wounds,
childrens sores, and injured and diseased, irritated, inflamed and unhealthy
conditions of the
skin. Of all chemists

Colonel llowl had just sufficient fire left
to tell Woodmylk to go to H —)|. But after

descended upon him, and it was not lessened
by Captain Blobbs, whose nerve was now
quite gone, and who considered that (he

ence to a fighting unit were as good as
accomplished. They discussed the painful
situation for some hours. There was com-
paratively little blasphemy. The C.O< seemed
temporarily to have lost the gift for if. In
tne end they arrived at a decision. It in-
volved bitter humiliation, but it was the
only possible road to safety. Mr. Wood-
mylk was presented with the C.O.’s compli-
requested to report again at the
Umei ly Room As he entered Colonel Howl
baled his teeth in a propitiatory smile
‘Mr. Woodmylk,” he said playfully. “I
am afraid that two of us lost our tempers
this morning.”
"No, Sir,” replied the young man: “only

“And at once?”
“At once, Sir.”

Adjutant— our young friend here desires
to go overseas. Is there any reason why so
capable and energetic an officer should not

The Colonel decided to swallow the dregs.
Leave? To be sure! Shall we say a
week? Ten days? Certainly. Captain

and Mr. Woodmylk will proceed to London
to-night. You will notify Mr. Woodmylk by
telephone when It is time for him to return
and join his draft.”
Once more Mr. Woodmylk saluted. He
was not ignored this time. The C.O. smiled

Port o’ Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are lights a-glimmer across the bay,
strung m a twinkling stream,
On the bosom of night like diamonds gay
They glitter, glint and gleam;
They’re the winking eyes of a seaport old,
Where pig-tailed sailors pore
Over faded charts marking hidden gold
On some far, tropic shore.
So, then, blow, blow, blow and blow a man
down!”—
Ah! the glowing lights of Adventure Town.
Those beckoning lights o’er the sleeping sea
-Mark where the great ships heave
In shimmering cloaks of mystery
A\ hich night’s mist-fingers weave—
Slow-riding at muttering anchor chain,
Rakish craft, tall and fair,
Gorged with great treasure from ships of
Spain,
Ingots and jewels rare.
“Away. Rio! We’re bound for Rio
Grande!”—
Oh! the whimsical charm of Pirate’s Strand.
But Romance is ever across the bay,
Beyond the hill or bend;
Such a heartless jade, for she steals away
Swift as the. rainbows’ end !
But, pitying one who cannot give chase,
Bound to his dreary bed,
She has paused a beat, in her endless race,
To speed an hour of dread;
For a gift from her is my Port o’ Night—
It is Williamstown by harsh daylight.

their ECONOMY IN .RUNNING -which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their

relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong-
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
