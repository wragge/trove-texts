COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
ohronia No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back arid chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronohitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
*■ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men . and Those Who

who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-

candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing

Dear Sir, —I feel it niy duty to let you know the won-
derful cure that the Solomon Solution has effected in a
very severe case of rheumatism. I have been practically
crippled with this terrible disease for over fourteen years,
and have suffered excruciating’ pains, the doctors being
quite unable to give the any relief. I was recommended
to try your Solution, and after only four applications felt
a most distinct relief in the affected joints, and an ease
of movement which I had never expected to feel again.
I continued the applieation, and my joints now move as
easily and as painlessly as they did in the days before they
were affected by the rheumatism. My friends are quite
unable to conceive how the Solution can work such a
wonderful cure, and you may be sure I am recommending
it to all fellow-sufferers. —Yours truly,
HANNAH RIOHENS.

Dear Bulletin, — The risks of the soldier,
sailor, fireman, are taken in the public eye, and
their bravery is much advertised, but the average
man knows little of the courage displayed by
many a lonely prospector, without companionship,
borne up by no feverish excitement. Yet the man
“ on his own ” who tries his luck on the goldfields,
and sets out with swag and feed and water-bag to
face the unknown, has need of more than ordinary
pluck in his equipment. Along the Coolgardie-
Menzies track, every few miles, you come on a
little mound marking the spot where some poor
devil fell from exhaustion or died of thirst. On
one such grave is placed the pipe and pannikin of
the dead man—no doubt these were his two best
friends in his travels. On another is a New Tes-
tament, belonging to one Petersen, the fly-leaf of
which is covered with pious inscriptions in differ-
ent hands, such as : “Pray for him,” “May his
soul rest in peace,” “Send word along to his
friends,” “ God be merciful to him,” “ Send up a
prayer for him,” &c., &c., showing that the
traveller out here has a kind as well as stout
heart. I have known men to stop in their tramp
and cut down saplings to fence in the grave of an
unknown wanderer.— Watersag.

When Father Comes Home From
The Lodge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When father comes home from the lodge,
O ! then you should hear mother dodge
In fifty directions,
Like plum-pudding sections
At sight of a famishing Hodge !
He’s amorous, clamorous —rather !
He bursts in the door with, “ Is Ma there ?
Hie 1 Love, it was prime !
We had sushjolly time ! ”
Says our rollicking, reckless old father.
“ There was Jones shang * Two Lovely Black
Eyes ! ’
(He’sh a good f’l’a, Jonesh, and no flies !)
And Mellor—he’sh Master-
Yelled, “ Chorush, and faster! ”
(Old charmer, we made the roof rise !)
Then Hockings holdsh on by the table
And standsh up—as much as he’sh able—
And bangs for a toast —
‘ The Ladiesh—our boast!
Hiphooraysh !’. . . Well—they talk about Babel!
“ And Mellor says, ‘ Brother J. Brown,
Chair callsh you reshpond—honor town ! ’ ”
“ What, you make a speech ! ”
“ Me, yes ! how you screech !
They all shpeak —why should I shtay down ?
So I saysh, ‘ I’ve heard brethren to-night
Talk of Nana, that beautiful sight;
But I didn’t go :
’Caush why ? Well, you know,
I’ve a Nana at home—she’sh all right! ”
You said that? You —you !” “Now, my
lovesh,
My darling, my angel, my dovesh 1
When I compliment her
She shouldn’t loseshtemper—
Besides, I know who’sh got boxsh glovesh !
And, Lyddy, though—here [—Brother Farmer
Used cater for Queen—’sif I’d harm her !
There’s one thing, I shwear,
That I couldn’t find there—
That’s a Irish from my lovely old charmer ! ”
And Jimmy and I hear it all,
With ears glued close up to the wall—
The talk and the scuffle
The bricks hardly muffle—
And wish we were grown up quite tall;
And yearn for the time to come—rather !
When we will burst in with, “ Is ma there ?
Hie ! Love, it wash prime !
We had sushjolly time ! ”
Like our merry, Masonic old father !

Startling facts ! The Australian people
are rapidly becoming a race of nervous wrecks,
and homoeopathy suggests the best remedy. The
Irving Homoeopathic Institute, corner Hunter

lars of their homoeopathic treatment, which is a
positive cure for nervousness and failing manly
vigor in young and old men. The homoeopathic
treatment cures in four weeks.*
CHANGE OF LIFE,
DIZZINESS AND SHORTNESS OF
BREATH CURED.
What Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills will do for
women at the change of life is shown in a case
reported in the Dewsbury (Eng.) Chronicle.
It is that of Mrs Benjamin Smith who lives
at Hanover-street, Dewsbury. The change
of life had left her weak and miserable;
with constant pains, dizziness, and shortness of
breath on the slightest exertion, together with
chronic rheumatism in the head and eyes. The
pain in her head was too acute for words ; she got
no sleep either by day or night, and her agony
was at times so great that it took two people to
hold her in bed. A skilful doctor was called in,
but did no good. “My cheeks would swell up as
big as saucers,” says Mrs. Smith ; “my eyes were
red as fire, and there was no getting rid of the
pains in the head. I also suffered from a sluggish
liver and a weak heart, and at times my eyesight
was so bad that objects before me seemed but dim
shadows, and there were none of my friends who
looked for my restoration to health.
_ “ I saw an account in a newspaper of a cure
similar to mine through the use of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and my husband urged me to try them.
Before two bottles were used the pains had dis-
appeared as if by magic, and the continued use of
the pills for a little more than a month has left me
enjoying as good health as ever I had in Iny life,
I consider Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a blessing* and
as I know there are thousands Of \Vdmeil who suffer
in silence from troubles having the same origin
as mine* I aha grateful enough for what they have
dorte for me to tell my story in the hope that some
Suffering sister may be similarly helped, and you
have full permission to publish what I have told
you, which statements can be verified bV any of
my neighbors.” This wonderful remedy is offered
to the public with a full confidence that there is
no disease arising from a watery Or impoverished
condition of the blood, Or shattered herVbhS forceS;
which it will not cure if the directions A,re faith-
fully followed And the treatment persisted in. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are not a
patent medicine, but a thoroughly scientific pre-
paration, the result of years of careful study on
the part of an eminent Edinburgh University
physician, and they were successfully used by him
m his everyday practice for years before being of-
fered for general sale. They positively cure Rheu-
matism, Sciatica, Lumbago, and Neuralgia, and
are a specific for all diseases of women, such as
anaemia, poor and watery blood, female irregulari-
ties, nervous headache and hysteria. They are
not a purgative medicine, but brace up and per-
manently strengthen the whole system.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will for-
ward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post order

Dear Sirs, —Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis _ and bronchitis, I desire to
add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating cough, with much ex*
pectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything I have tried. It,loojens the mucus,
which, therefore, comes more readily away, and the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
Yours respectfully, THOMAS STOKER.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Remarkable Experience of Miss Dorothy
Maher, Fitzroy, Victoria, whose portrait
we are privileged to give below:
“I take pleasure in testifying to
the great benefit I derived from
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I suffered
from eruptions on my face of a very
irritating and vexatious nature.
For a considerable time I experi-
mented with various so-called blood
medicines, but without any allevia-
tion of my trouble. At last, your
famous Sarsaparilla being strongly
recommended to me, I began to use
it, and after taking two bottles it
was most gratifying to see and feel
the effect in allaying the irritation
and reducing the eruptions. When
I had used three bottles the erup-
tions disappeared altogether, with-
out leaving a mark on my face, and
I have never been troubled with
anything of the kind since.”

Dear Bulletin, —So Dr. Cobb “stands up
for the crow,” does he? Well, Dr. Cobb can’t
know the crow from a crow—the crow Bill and
I know, anyway. Bill could tell you all about
crows, but as most likely he’s engaged just now
losing himself and his empty water-bag on some
parched-up plain; or is busy writing an ode to
me, his old mate Jim, whose death he’s probably
just heard reported again (that’d make it 29
times); I feel it my sacred and solemn duty
to let my spite out on Mr. Crow. In my
option there is no more vicious fiend on
Orod s beautiful earth than our own Austra-
lian crow. Eaglehawks and dingoes aren’t a
patch on him for cruelty, cunning, and destruc-
t* v ® neas - No, I haven’t seen crows pick eyes out
of half-dead people, but I know they’d do it if
they had half a chance. I’ve tried them, and you
can try them if you like, by lying still for a few
minutes under a tree. Mr. Crow soon spots you,
and perches on a branch above you. There, cun-
ningly turning his head from side to side, like a
Earrot in a cage listening to your “ pretty cocky,”
e watches you a while, and gradually comes
lower, and at last flies on to the ground some little
distance away. With his wings half-open and
nervously twitching, ready to fly in case
of danger, he comes closer and closer with a
sort of side-shuffle, watching you carefully all
the time with his fiendish white eyes. If you
keep quiet, he’ll have a peck at your cloth, or, if
still doubtful (they’re awful cowards), fly up to a
branch again and call for his mates. They’ll soon
arrive, and all have a try to find out, before
tackling you, whether you’re helpless enough to
stand pecking at. Some will drop small sticks on
you, and, if that doesn’t move you, dirt will
follow, and, if you don’t get up then—well,
I got up then. Last summer, I found a corpse
(victim of the heat-wave) out in the “ dry corner.”
The body was literally covered with crows,
though the poor fellow couldn’t have been dead
more than an hour or two. Yet both his eyes
were picked out and his brain pulled through the
sockets by the black fiends. His nose was also
gone, and his mouth a gory, torn-about gap, minus
the tongue. It was a ghastly sight, and, to
revenge the poor fellow, I started to pelt sticks
at the crows, who were perched on an adjacent
tree calmly awaiting my departure. They must
have been at that man before he was dead, judg-
ing from the work done. But crows don’t often
banquet On human eyes. Weak ewes, lambs, bogged
sheep, cattle, and horses are their general prey.
Has Dr. Cobb ever seen a swarm of his black pets
wait for a ewe lambing? It’s a pitiful sight to
see the often hopelessly-weak mother trying to
save her offspring. At lambing time paddocks
are full of blind ewes and lambs staggering about
followed by crows. Pastoralists lose thousands of
their sheep yearly by the beaks of these black
wretches. If a sheep or cow gets bogged or
caught in a wire-fence the black devils pounce
upon them and have their eyes out long before
they are dead; some live days after. Has
Dr. Cobb ever watched a crow take the
young ones out of a galah’s or other
bird’s nest, while the parents anxiously fluttered
around hopelessly attempting to save their brood ?
Every bird, every animal, and every man worth
the name in the bush, bitterly hates the crow, and
has a cut at him whenever possible. But stop—
there’s one good point about the crow. When lost
in the bush you can always depend upon finding
water by following his flight at midday or sun-
down ; or by making to where you hear his mono-
tonous “Go an’ die.” But, then, if the wretches
only knew, they’d most certainly lead you away
from water for the sake of your eyes.—6 xB.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a PnC6 HithSftO TTll-
known Her© a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Yuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Pull-sized Cigars for 6d.!!— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits ;a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
]^ o^e .—Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

The pleasures of an Australian holiday have
become largely enhanced through the facilities
afforded by the railways to the dweller in the
crowded, dusty city or wide-spreading, arid
plains of the interior to escape to the cool, re-
freshing atmosphere of the mountain range, in
the one case, or the delicious breezes of the sea-
side in the other, where, forgetting the toil and
worry of business life, he obtains the change of
scene so necessary to the recuperation of his
physical and mental powers. To those engaged
in the routine of country labor there can be no
greater enjoyment than that afforded by a holi-
day trip to one of the beautiful seaside resorts
in which New South Wales is so rich ; and the
opportunity furnished by the summer holiday
season for enjoying this pleasure causes the
approach of Christmas and the New Year to be
hailed with delight by the sun-browned bush-
man, who possesses a wide choice of picturesque
localities in which to pass his holiday hours.

The Australian public
—who are generally under
the impression that their
native tongue is not
understood on board
these magnificent steam-
ers will doubtless be
gratified to learn that
English Stewards are
carried on all steamers,
and that all officers are
acquainted with the
English language. Many
people look at the Over-
land Journey from Mar-
seilles to London with a
sentiment of dread. They
fancy that the trip by
train is tedious, that their
native tongue on a foreign
soil may not be spoken or
understood. All this is
a great mistake. The
overland journey from
Marseilles to London, far
from being long and tedi-
ous, may be accomplished
in 23 hours, as compared
with the six days’ sea trip
by Gibraltar and the Bay
of Biscay. Again, the
passenger who has no
special reason for hurry-
ing through the continent
may leisurely travel over
France during 14 days,
for which time his ticket
is available. He is thus
afforded an opportunity
of visiting Paris, about
which city any praise
would almost be out of
place. It may also be
advisable to add that in
all hotels of any standing
throughout the continent,
and especially in Paris,
English is spoken as. well
as French by all waiters-

Song of the Artesian Water,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now the stock have started dying, for the Lord
has sent a drought ;
But we’re sick of prayers and Providence—we’re
going to do without;
With the derricks up above us and the solid earth
below,
We are waiting at the lever for the word to let
her go.
Sinking down, deeper down ;
Oh, we’ll sink it deeper down.
As the drill is plugging downward at a thousand
feet of level,
If the Lord won’t send us water, oh, we’ll get it
from the devil;
Yes, we’ll get it from the devil deeper down.
Now, our engine’s built in Glasgow by a very
canny Scot,
And he marked it twenty horse-power, but he
don’t know what is what.
When Canadian Bill is firing with the sun-dried
gidgee logs,
She can equal thirty horses and a score or so of
dogs.
Sinking down, deeper down,
Oh, we’re going deeper down.
If we fail to get the water then it’s ruin to the
squatter,
For the drought is on the station and the weather’s
growing hotter,
But we’re bound to get the water deeper down.
But the shaft has started caving and the sinking’s
very slow,
And the yellow rods are bending in the water
down below,
And the tubes are always jamming and they can’t
be made to shift
Till we nearly burst the ''Agine with a forty horse-
power lift.
Sinking down, deeper down,
Oh, we’re going deeper down.
Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes
are always jamming,
Yet we’ll fight our way to water while the stub-
born drill is ramming—
While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.
But there’s no artesian water, though we’ve passed
three thousand feet.
And the contract price is growing and the boss is
nearly beat.
But it must be down beneath us, and it s down
we’ve got to go,
Though shes bumping on the solid rock four
thousand feet below.
Sinking down, deeper down ;
_Oh, we’re going deeper down,
And it’s time they heard us knocking on the roof
of Satan’s dwellin’;
But we’ll get artesian water if we cave the roof of
hell in—
Oh ! we’ll get artesian water deeper down.
But it’s hark ! the whistle’s blowing with a wild,
exultant blast,
And the boys are madly cheering, for they’ve
struck the flow at last,
And it’s rushing up the tubing from four thousand
feet below
Till it spouts above the casing in a million-gallon
flow.
And it’s down, deeper down—
Oh, it comes from deeper down ;
It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free, unstinted
measure
From the silent hidden places where the old earth
hides her treasure—
Where the old earth hides her treasure deeper
down.
And it’s clear away the timber, and it’s let the
water run :
How it glimmers in the shadow, how it flashes in
the sun !
By the silent belts of timber, by the miles of
blazing’ plain
It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land
again.
Flowing down, further down ;
It is flowing further down
To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing gladness
in its going;
Through the droughty days of summer it is flow-
ing, ever flowing—
It is flowing, ever flowing, further down.
THE BANJO.
" The Secret of the Sea,"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LONGFELLOW.
Ah ! What pleasant visions haunt me
As I gaze upon the sea ;
All the old romantic legends,
All my dreams come hack to me.
“Wouldst thou” —so the helmsman answered—
“ Learn the secret of the sea?
Only those who brave its dangers
Comprehend its mystery 1 ”
Beautiful words ! But do those who brave
its dangers comprehend the “ Secret of the Sea ”?
And, if so, how is it that the shipmen are, one and
all, if not voiceless, yet inarticulate ? It is remark-
able that the sea has not given to the English-
speaking world one great poet, or even a minor
poet of note. It cannot be that the imaginative
faculty is lacking in those “that go down to the
sea in ships,” for none are more fanciful than
sailormen—even now, when board and State
schools and steam and the “ mighty march of
modern progress ” generally have done so much to
exploit the mystery of which poet Longfellow
sings. The grizzled shellbacks of the old wooden
sailing-ship days —of the epoch prior to iron
vessels, double topsail yards, and floating steam
palaces—were often permeated with true poetic
feeling, however rude the expression thereof may
have been. “ How do you contrive to keep awake
on the look-out on fine nights ? ” was asked of a
blasphemous, barnacle-encrusted ancient mariner.
“ I tries to think things out —where the birds’
songs come from, and the flowers’ smell, and what
it is at back of the purple on the hills.” He
pointed to the sun rising in tropic splendor and
to the many-colored glories of the eastern heavens
—“ The sun a-shinin’ on God’s garden flowers ! ”
he explained, with comprehensive wave of tarry
hand.
Once, sailing with light, favoring breeze through
Sunda’s Straits—no lovelier place exists on earth—■
the setting sun, shedding crimson radiance on
land and sea, on the “ mountain wooded to the
peak,” and on the swelling canvas of the ship,
suddenly irradiated a canoe lightly drifting bow-
first on that summer sea to eastward. In it, face
to sky, a dark-skinned man stark and dead, and a
great bird, snow-white, sitting sphinx-like in the
stern gazing fixedly on the face of the dead—
“ Floating to glory and Christ’s archangel a-
steerin’,” was the comment, surely not all un-
imaginative, of the most gnarled old reprobate
aboard. A large number of the “chanties,” or
sailors’ songs, sung 30 years or more ago, were bar-
baric and coarse; others there were, however,
replete with poetry and imagination, full of sug-
gestions of the “ Secret of the Sea,” and chanted
to melodies strange, wild, plaintive, and fascinat-
ing—songs and airs to the originals of which
Ulysses arid “The World’s Desire” may have
listened.
* * * »
But the deep-sea men can no more help
being imaginative than they can the salt drop in
their blood that bids them wander till they die.
For they perforce must mark Ocean’s occult moods
and tenses and something understand of the mute
hints that sunrises and sunsets —no two ever alike
—give of eternity and that greater secret of exist-
ence in which the lesser secret of the sea is merged.
Something, too, they must gather of the mystery
of gales and calms; they near, as no landsman
hears, the voices of the night, the weird tongues
that whisper in the ratlings or shriek among the
shrouds and stays. They see, as not even the
desert Arabs see, the mighty marshalling array
and splendor of the stars. They know there is
no real but only an apparent sameness in the com-
ings and the goings of the sea. To the landsman
all seas are merely sea, all skies but sky. To the
initiate each ocean has its own distinctive features,
habits and customs-its own particular color,
movement, length, and rhythmical sweep of wave,
and its own distinctive skies to arch above and
meet it at horizon’s edge; so that an old salt—
could he be hypnotised and so carried to any sea
he had sailed, and then aroused—would surely,
within a little, recognise latitude and longitude.
For the skilled seamen, the trackers of the waters,
sees signs and tokens to others invisible—ay ! and
dream dreams no shoredweller dreams. And in
these faculties is something of the “ Secret of the
Sea.”
* * * »
That seafaring men are imaginative is
evidenced also by their legend and tradition. The
race that evolved the story of the “ Flying Dutch-
man ” had surely ideality. And, cn passant, it
may be remarked that the occasional appearance
in the region of the Cape of Good Hope of an old-
time vessel carrying a press of canvas, while the
vessels which encounter her are reefed down, is as
well authenticated as is the existence of the sea-
serpent, in which phenomenon the present pen-
man admits profound belief. Mention of the Fly-
ing Dutchman recalls an incident which came
under the writer’s personal cognizance and which,
as it never received the slightest elucidation, may
rightly be regarded as a secret of the sea :
In November, 1859, the barque Marion, bound
from London to Hongkong and three days out
from the Cape of Good Hope, was chased—no
other word describes it—by a large red light, pre-
cisely similar in color to, but about twice the size
of, a ship’s port sidelight, and as high out of the
water as the sidelight of a vessel of the calibre of
the Great Eastern. The light, straight ahead and
coming down with great speed, was first seen
about three bells in the second dog-watch—the
night somewhat hazy, wind moderate and fitful
moon. When the helm was ported the light sud-
denly disappeared, but presently came rushing up
on the port quarter, vanished, came up, first on
one, then on the other beam and, a few moments
later, was right ahead again. After nigh crazing
the ship’s company for an hour or over it came no
more. An experience so disconcerting naturally
stimulated all there was of imaginative faculty
whether before or abaft the mast, and much
horrific legend resulted—one, by an old foremast
hand, ran as follows: “I was A.B. aboard the
Bombay, and was goin’ forrnd, bein’ relieved from
the wheel just arter eight bells o’ the first night-
watch—dark, sloppy, greasy night it were,
drizzlin’, not much wind. Watch all stowed
away under lee of fo’castle. Just as I comes abaft
the forehatch I sees someone a-sittin’ on the wet
hatch. ‘ Hullo ! ’ I says, ‘ who’s that V It never
spoke—only, as I comes abreast of it, it turns its
head and looks me straight in the eyes. It were a
dead face, but all lit up with a pale light ! It
weren’t the face of anybody as belonged to that
hooker l All hands and the old man saw that face
one time or another durin’ the passage.”
A narration by an officer was of equally uncom-
fortable a nature: “ When a midshipman in one
of Green’s ships, then three months from port, he
was sent aloft one night to loose a main topgallant
sail. As he was loosing the bunt a man whom he
did not know crept towards him from the weather
yard-arm. The narrator jumped for the backstay
and slid to deck. Two men were sent aloft to
interview the man on the yard, who was plainly
visible from the deck —the idea being either that it
was a practical joke or that a man was walking in
his sleep. The two men slid down as rapidly as
the first, declaring the visitant did not belong to
the ship. The captain was called, all hands were
mustered and found present. Captain and chief
mate then went aloft and attempted to capture
the intruder who, with a loud scream, apparently
threw himself from the yard-arm into the sea;
but no one heard or saw him strike the water.”
* * * *
Perhaps the most imaginative of British-
speaking seamen are Welshmen. The writer, as
a boy, and for his sins, served under a Welsh chief
mate who, on night watches, would invite the
former on the poop, ostensibly for nautical instruc-
tion and to arouse in his young breast the ambition
to become a great sea-captain ; but, really, to
freeze his youthful marrow by the narration of
virulent nautical ghost-stories (and thus induce
preternatural wakefulness and watchfulness in the
junior) while he (the mate) subsequently snored
upon a hencoop. He was more tolerable even
snoring than as a romancist.
One night, in the North Atlantic, the mate
soothed himself to slumber by a ghostly narrative
more than usually ghastly. The man at the
wheel, encouraged by the quietude, probably
dozed; the look-out certainly slept; the writer
meditated spook generally and the Cambrian
variety thereof particularly—with his eyes closed.
Of a sudden there was a rushing as of mighty
wings. Shaving our taffrail, standing west under
a cloud of canvas—we were heading northward,
homeward bound—was a great American-built
ship, whence sprung in that lonely but moonlit
ocean Heaven knows ! “ Ballarat, ahoy ! ” —she
was close enough to read the name blazoned in
gold upon our stern—“ Ballarat, ahoy ! Are ye
all asleep, Britisher ? ” came the cheery hail borne
clear upon the breeze. There followed a rippling
laugh, a woman’s laugh, and the moonbeams
glanced and danced upon the fair hair of a girl
standing on the topgallant rail of the strange ship
and holding to the rigging, lightly swaying to and
fro. “ Ha ! ha ! ha ! Wake up ; Good-night,
Britisher ! God bless you ! GOOD-NIGHT !
Good-night ! Good-night! ” And the stranger
that had brought us benison, having a strong fair
wind and keeping away a couple of points, swept
onwards into the night and, the moon clouding
over, was lost to our ken for evermore. Good
night! Good night! And for us, who had
not heard voice from the outside, or looked on the
face of woman for months, was there naught of
poetry in such a meeting, nothing of the mystery
and the secret of the sea and the mystery of life,
in that girl’s sweet, sudden benediction, flung
wide and free on the waters to those she had
never seen before, and was, mayhap, to meet
nevermore on earth or sea ?
* * * *
Quaint, imaginative, and tinged with the
mystery of the sea were the views held by old-
time sailors regarding birds. The stormy petrel,
or “Mother Carey’s chicken,” was, for instance
looked upon as robin-redbreast of the waters, and
was safe from gunshot and decoy-line; for it carried
over the crested wave the souls of departed
shipmasters. Nor did sailors hold with killing
the cruel and greedy albatross, as it, they thought,
possessed occult power to wreck ships and drown
men. But the shore birds blown to sea they
would capture, feed, fondle, and set free within
sight of land ; for they carried the souls of little
children that lay beneath the green turf in quiet
churchyards. And here an incident might perhaps
furnish a theme for the singer of the sea that is to
come : The writer, going aloft leisurely at sunset
—it was off the Gulf of Guinea—chanced to look
down. On the far side of the slowly-moving ship
there floated, face-upwards, a little, white-robed
child gay with ’broidery and pink ribbons—gay,
but dead ; its tiny face round and with the curves
of health ; its arms outstretched as if in mute
appeal to its mother. God knows who mourned
it! God knows from whose tendei but heedless
embrace and breast it had slipped to oblivion on
the broader bosom of the sea ! It may, falling
from some ship’s deck, have sunk, and, after,
risen.
Something stirred in the clear water below. A
fathom or less beneath the child, convoying it,
fluttered, watching and waiting—appalling, black,
and spectral—a square acre or more of vast, flat,
quadrangular, beaked fish. Scarcely they seemed
to progress, only, now and again, one would
change position with another. And so the little
one, shadowed by its awesome attendants, went
drifting away on unknown currents to unknown
coasts ; maybe to lie at last in some pearl-lined
cavern of the sea, or to be washed on the shore
where is the Garden of the Hesperides, there to
rest until the sea gives up its Secret and its Dead.
* * * *
Not least among the secrets of the sea is
the fascination it exerts on those who have once
succumbed to its influence. The shipman, railing
ever at his mistress the sea, yet loves her in any
of her moods. Vowing to forsake her finally when
once his foot touches shore, he nevertheless re-
turns to her again and again, when she calls to
him from the far inland meadows, from the bush,
the mine, or from “ the vision splendid of the sun-
lit plains.” The real sailor, the born seaman, may
drift away from, but sooner or later almost inevit-
ably drifts back to, the unquiet bosom of his first
love. He may put half a continent between ocean
and himself, but some day there comes “so loud
a calling of the sea ” that the old chest is rum-
maged from the lumber-room and ocean gets her
own again. There was one, kinsman and once
shipmate of the writer, to whom the sea had been
unkind. He left it to find wealth, wife, and posi-
tion on dry land. The years, passed. There came
a summer season when—business anchoring him
to the grim city so that he could not seek the sea
for even a few hours—he spent every available
minute in the little steamers plying between
bridges, making believe very hard that yellow
Thames was cerulean Indian Ocean.
“ But,” said one, “you hate the sea? ”
“ Hate it! I love it! The temptation to go back
to it altogether—to its freedom, to the excitement
of wild weather, the charm of hot days under the
line, when the scented pitch bubbles from the
planks, and when one sinks to sleep on snowy
decks with coil of rope for pillow, and, fanned by
bellying mainsail, wakes to sec the sun come up,
splendid ; wakes strong, fresh, alive —I say the
temptation to cast everything aside and go back
is almost too much for me ! ”
And at last he went, leaving wife, wealth, and
duty, to double stormy capes and headlands, and
find a sailor’s death on the sea that will not be
denied.

And he who writes ? Whenever there
comes to him the scent of sweetbriar his thoughts,
vaulting bygone years, fly to a certain day on
Eastern tropio sea—the most beautiful day he
shall ever see on earth. Then, in fancy, he sees
once more an ocean divine in color and purity;
sees the glittering flight of myriad flying-fish, the
glory of the nautilus, the sheen of albicore and
bonito darting under keel, and the many-tinted
ever-flitting sails of proas. He hears again the
music of splashing oars and sailors’ songs sung far
away, while from the hills, lying purple and dis-
tant yet lustrous under the effulgent sun, are
wafted the odors of briar, of rose, and of sweet-
smelling spices. And to him also the old longing
comes back. And then ? And then a voice,
tender and true, which says with Ovid, though
not in the Latin tongue:
“ Quid tibi cum pclago ? Terra contentus fuisses."

Bill and Jim Fall Out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill and Jim are mates no longer—they would
scorn the name of mate —
Those two bushmen hate each other with a soul-
consuming hate;
Yet erstwhile they were as brothers should be
(tho’ they never will) :
Ne’er were mates to one another half so true as
Jim and Bill.
Bill was one of those who have to argue every day
or die —
Tho’, of course, he swore ’twas Jim who always
itched to argufy.
They would, on most abstract subjects, contradict
each other flat
And at times in lurid language—they were mates
in spite of that.
Bill believed the Bible story re the origin of him—
He was sober, he was steady, he was orthodox;
while Jim,
Who, we grieve to state, was always getting into
drunken scrapes,
Held that man degenerated from degenerated
apes.
Bill was British to the backbone, he was loyal
through and through ;
Jim declared that Blucher’s Prussians won the
fight at Waterloo,
And he hoped the color’d races would in time wipe
out the white —
And it rather strained their mateship, but it
didn’t burst it quite.
They battled round in Maoriland —they saw it
through and through—
And argued on the rata, what it was and how it
grew ;
Bill believed the vine grew downward, Jim de-
clared that it grew up —
Yet they always shared their fortunes to the final
bite and sup.
Night after night they argued how the kangaroo
was born,
And each one held the other’s stupid theories in
scorn.
Bill believed it was “ born inside,” Jim declared it
was born out —
Each as to his own opinions never had the slight-
est doubt.
They left the earth to argue and they went among
the stars.
Re conditions atmospheric, Bill believed “ the hair
of Mars
Was too thin for human bein’s to exist in mortal
states. ”
Jim declared it was too thick; if anything—yet
they were mates.
Bill, for Freetrade; Jim, Protection; argued as to
which was best
For the welfare of the workers—and their mate-
ship stood the test !
They argued over what they meant and didn’t
mean at all,
And what they said and didn’t —and were mates
in spite of all.
Till one night the two together tried to light a fire
in camp
When they had a leaky billy and the wood was
scarce and damp.
And —no matter —let the moral be distinctly
understood :
One alone should tend the fire, while the other
brings the wood.

O'Toole and M'Sharry.
(A LACHLAN IDYLL.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fn the valley of the Lachlan, where the perfume
from the pines
Fills the glowing summer air like incense
spreading;
Where the silent flowing river like a bar of silver
shines
When the winter moon its pallid beams is
shedding ;
Fn a hut on a selection, near a still and silent pool,
Lived two mates, who used to shear and fence
and .carry ;
The one was known, both near and far, as Dandy
Dari O’Toole,
And the other as Cornelius M'Sharry.
And they’d share each other’s blankets, and each
other’s horses ride,
And go off together shearing in the summer ;
They would canter on from sunrise to the gloam-
ing, side by side,
While M'Sharry rode the Barb and Dan the
Drummer,
And the boys along the Lachlan recognised it as a
rule
From Kugowra to the plains of Wanandarry,
That if ever love was stronger than M‘Sharry’s
for O’Toole
’Twas tjhe love O’Toole extended to M'Sharry.
And their love might have continued and been
constant to the end,
And they might have still been affable and jolly,
But they halted at a shanty where the river takes
a bend,
And were waited on by Doolan’s daughter,
Polly.
Now, this pretty Polly Doolan was so natty, neat
and cool,
And so pleasant, that they both agreed to tarry,
For she winked her dexter eye-lid at susceptible
O’Toole,
While she slyly winked the other—at M'Sharry.
So they drank her health in bumpers till the rising
of the moon,
And. she had them both in bondage so com-
pletely .
That each time they talked of going she said,
“ Must you go so soon ? ”
And they couldn’t go. She smiled at them so
sweetly.
Dan O’Toole grew sentimental and M Sharry
played the fool,
Though they each had sworn an oath they d
never marry,
Yet the self-same dart from Cupid’s bow that
vanquished Dan O’Toole
Had gone through the heart of honest Con
M'Sharry.
Then M'Sharry thought, “If Dandy Dan got
drunk and went to bed
He (M'Sharry) could indulge his little folly,”
And Dan thought if M'Sharry once in drunken
sleep lay spread,
He Could have a little flirt with pretty Polly ;
So they kept the bottle going till they both were
pretty full,
And yet each rival seemed inclined to tarry ;
The precise amount of pain-killer it took to fill
O’Toole
Was required to close the optics of M'Sharry.
So the rivals lost their tempers, and they called
each other names,
And disturbed the Doolan children from their
pillows,
And then Doolan came and told them that he
wouldn’t have such games,
Thqy must go and fight it out beneath the
willows.
So they went beneath the willows, near a deep
and shady pool,
With as much ’aside as each of them could
carry,
And M'Sharry started thumping the proboscis of
O’Toole,
And O’Toole retaliated on M'Sharry.
And they fought till they were winded, and yet
neither had the best,
Though from each of them the blood was freely
flowing;
And they paused at last to breathe awhile and take
a moment’s rest,
But O’Toole’s two -yes with rage were fairly
glowing ;
Then without a moment’s warning he charged for-
ward like a bull,
And before poor Con had time to run or parry,
With a terrible momentum the big head of Dan
O’Toole
Went, bump ! into the stomach of M'Sharry.
And the force of the concussion laid M'Sharry out
quite still,
With his feet above his head among the bushes,
While O'Toole, with the momentum, cannoned
madly down the hill,
And fell plump in the lagoon among the rushes.
Like a weedy river-god he climbed the far side of
the pool,
And he did not for one single moment tarry,
For the curse of Cain was in the brain of Dandy
Dan O’Toole,
Who felt certain he had settled poor M'Sharry.
Now, while Dan O’Toole was stealing through the
still and silent night,
And his aching brain with pain-killer was
throbbing,
M'Sharry lay and listened, till his heart stood
still with fright,
And he eased his guilty soul with silent sobbing.
For he heard his boon-companion falling headlong
in the pool,
And he thought he was as dead as poor old
Harry,
And M'Sharry mourned the drowning of poor
Dandy Dan O’Toole,
While O’Toole was sadly weeping for M Sharry.
And the valley of the Lachlan never more will
know the men, .
That were once so loving, frolicsome, and frisky,
For O’Toole cleared out to Queensland and was
never seen again,
While M'Sharry started south and took to
whisky.
And M'Sharry, in his nightmare, often sees that
fatal pool,
And the pricks of guilty conscience tries to
parry ,
While away among the backblocks wanders Dandy
Dan O’Toole,
Always flying from the ghost of Con M Sharry.

The Last of His Tribe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was years ago in new country on a Northern
Territory creek. We had struck the creek the
fight bJfore, and at daylight began following it
down. By noon things began to look rather
doubtful. The creek continued a dry, shallow
watercourse, bordered with polygonum ; on either
side limitless downs : there seemed no change m it,
nor likely to be any. The horses were getting to
look very tucked-up, and there was no chance ot
going back. However, soon after noon we flushed
I bronze-wing pigeon, and this gave us h°pe, for
bronze-wing pigeons drink regularly every evening
and gradually make their way into the watering-
places by short flights during the afternoon.
There were two of us and a black boy. Holden,
my mate, who had ridden up the downs a little
way, suddenly whistled to me, and when I rode to
join him he pointed ahead. , . , , , ,
“There’s either a lagoon or a big blue-bush
flat,” he said. . , j
Certainly, a mile or so away the creek broad-
ened out into what might as easily have been one
as the other. By means of field-glasses we made
it out to be water, and returned to the creek
much relieved. The wind was away from us an
the horses slouched listlessly on in fact, we had
been in full sight of the lagoon some time before
they awoke to the fact that there was a fine water-
hole right under their noses. Both horses and
cattle when thirsty go entirely by smell. Lhey
will walk past water should the wind be from
the wrong direction, while, if it blows from water
—or even damp earth —two or three miles away,
you can’t hold them.
It was still a good lagoon, although the poly-
gonum ring showed that, when full, it was a fine
sheet of water. There is no better, cleaner camp
than the short sward that grows on the sloping
bank of an inland lagoon as the water recedes.
Holden and I were soon enjoying a lazy smoke
and congratulating ourselves on our luck, whilst
our contented horses grazed around, when my
attention was drawn to an object moving on the
opposite bank. Holden’s attention was occupied
just then with a fine pair of wood-ducks, which he
reckoned would make a good supper; the black
boy, of course, had gone to sleep. Something
black was crawling along the water’s edge on the
opposite bank. A gidyea scrub ran down just
there, so that the figure was less conspicuous.
Without speaking to Holden, I got the glasses and
had a good look.
A nigger of some sort was feebly crawling
along the bank, every now and again thrust-
ing one arm deep in the water. I handed the
glasses to Holden and told him to look. He was
surprised. The idea of there being any blacks
about had never occurred to either of us, as for
miles and miles we had seen neither tracks nor
smoke. .
“It’s an old gin,” he said at last, getting
mussels out of the muddy bank. There’s some-
thing moving in the scrub behind —a native dog.
Let’s go round and interview her.”
I took a piece of damper, and Holden took the
shot-gun for thebenefit of the aforesaid ducks. It
was a long walk round, and when we came to the
spot we found there an old; attenuated skeleton of
a gin feebly groping for mussels, of which she had
succeeded in gathering about two-thirds of a dilly-
bag. She was almost blind, and was accompanied
by two gaunt dingoes, which bared their fangs at
us in that evil grin that makes every bushinan
hate a wild dog. The old gin did not recognise
us as whites with her rheumy eyes, but seemed
incensed at our presence, and apparently tried to
set on to us the dogs, which were only restrained
by their instinctive fear of a white. I offered her
the damper, but she struck it feebly out of my
hand, and the dogs fell on and fought for it.
We looked around for further tracks, but
could find none ; and, as we could do nothing more
then, we strolled back to camp, Holden on the
way bagging the ducks.
Next morning the old lady was at her mussel-
fishing again, and Holden proposed that we should
take round some of the duck and some fish we had
caught. We took Bob, the black-boy, with us,
thinking that perhaps she might recognise and
take the food from him.
It was a worse failure than before, as the dogs
went for Bob at once and nearly got themselves
killed for it. She refused the food, and the hungry
dogs got it again.
It was so good a camp in every respect that
we proposed staying there for some days for the
horses’ sake; but the gin was such an un-
sociable old lady that we let her alone, although
she was at her mussel-fishing every day with her
two jackal-like attendant's. Once, when the wind
was blowing across the lagoon, I thought I could
smell burning gidyea, but was not sure. Of course
the poor old wretch had a camp somewhere where
she cooked and ate her shellfish, but as she did not
want us, we did not call.
One strange thing we noticed. At one end of
the lagoon was a native camp some two years old
or more. It was not ‘very large, but, barring
the old gin, it was the latest indication of natives
we discovered. On the morning preceding our
departure we were eating breakfast when Bob ex-
claimed, “Look!—old gin dead!” He pointed
across, and with the glasses I too saw a black arm
poked stiffly out of the water.
When we got round we found that the old
creature had slipped in, and, although she had
hung on to a branch, she had been too feeble to re-
cover, and had been drowned. We got her out and
put her on the bank, just as the dogs came up,
with their everlasting grin.
Holden looked at me and took out his revolver.
He was one of the few good pistol-shots I have
ever met. There were two shots and the brutes
were dead. We both hated them. We covered
the old gin with boughs and returned to our
camp but not to our breakfast.
That night we were awakened by a noise like
sobbing from across the lagoon.
Bob woke up and heard it too. It came from
the direction of the dead gin, and he made one
frightened bound on to his legs; we had to kick
him half-way to the lagoon before we could make
him understand that we didn’t want him. Then
we sat and listened. In the deep silence of the
windless night a strange noise was certainly com-
ing from where the gin’s body lay. It was a croon-
ing, wailing noise, very eerie in that place and at
that time. “ Let’s take a couple of candles and go
round,’’ suggested Holden. Bob followed us ; he
was too frightened to stop alone.
We knew the way pretty well, and, when we got
near the place and the location of the strange
noise, we lit our candles and investigated. A
strange sight we saw. An old blackfellow with
white hair and beard, as shrunken as the dead
gin—and until you have seen an old black gin in
the starvation districts, you cannot conceive how
attenuated a human being can become lay
moaning near the bodies of the old woman and
the dogs. He was sightless, and we presently
found that he was crippled, and could only drag
himself along the ground. We gave him a drink
from the lagoon, but he was evidently dying, and
when we came back in the morning he was dead.
We buried him, the gin, and the two dogs m a
shallow grave, and then searched the place. Back
in the scrub we found a camp—such a camp ! A
poor break-wind of old boughs, a fire, still
smouldering, which the old man evidently tended
while the gin sought the only means of existence
it was possible for her to find, the wretched
Hl The mystery of the whole thing we never
fathomed—why no blacks had come near the lagoon
for years, and why the old pair had been left there
by themselves.
DELCOMYN.
Concerning a Steeplechase
Rider.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the ways in which men get a living
there is none so hard and so precarious as that of
steeplechase-riding in Australia. It is bad enough
in England, where steeplechases only take place
in winter, when the ground is soft, and where the
horses are properly schooled before being raced,
and where the obstacles for the most part will
yield a little if struck and give a, horse a chance
to blunder over safely. In Australia the men have
to go at racing-speed on very hard ground, over
the most rigid and uncompromising obstacles—
ironbark rails clamped into solid posts with bands
of iron. No wonder they are always coming to
grief, and are always in and out of hospital in
splints and bandages. Sometimes one reads that
a horse has fallen and the rider has “escaped with
a severe shaking.” That “shaking,’ gentle reader,
would lay you or me up for weeks, with a doctor
to look after us and a crowd of sympathetic friends
calling to know how our poor back was. But the
steeplechase-rider has to be out and about again,
“ riding exercise ’’every morning, and “schooling
all sorts of cantankerous brutes over the fences.
These men take their lives in their hands and look
at grim death between their horses’ ears every tune
they race or “ school.”
The death-record among Australian cross-
country jockeys and horses is something awful .
it is a curious instance of how custom sanctifies all
things that such horse-and-man slaughter is ac-
cepted in such a calm, callous way. If any theatre
gave a show at which men and horses were habitu-
ally crippled and killed in full sight of the audience
the manager would be tried for manslaughter™ no
time. But the race-tracks use up their yearly
average of horses and men without attracting re-
mark. One would suppose that the risk being so
great the profits were enormous ; but they arenot
—quite otherwise, in fact. In “the game as
played on our racecourses there is just a bare liv-
ing for a good capable horseman while he lasts,
with the certainity of an ugly smash if he keeps at
it long enough.
* * * *
And they don’t need to keep at it very
long. After a few good “shakings” they begin
to “ take a nip or two ” to put heart into them
before they go out, and after awhile they have to
increase the dose. So that at last they cannot
ride at all without a regular cargo of alcohol on
board, and they are either “ half-muzzy ” or shaky
according as they have taken too much or too
little. And then they commence to fall—it is an
old axiom that as soon as a man begins to funk he
begins to fall. The reason is that a rider who has
lost his nerve is afraid of his horse making a mis-
take, and takes a pull or urges him onward just at
the critical instant—the one crucial moment when
the horse is rattling up to his fence and judging
his distance so as to make his spring. And the
little pull at his head or the little touch of the
spur takes his attention from the fence, with the
result that he makes his spring a foot too far off
or a foot too close in, and—smash ! And then the
loafers who hang about the big fences rush up to
see if the jockey is killed or stunned, and, if so,
they dispose of any jewellery he may have about
him —they have been known to almost tear off a
finger in their endeavors to secure the ring. And
the ambulance clatters up at a canter, the poor
rider is pushed in out of sight, and the ladies in
the stand say how unlucky they are—that brute
of a horse falling after they backed him. And a
wolfish-eyed man in the Leger-stand shouts to a
wolfish-eyed pal, “ Bill, I believe that jock was
killed when the chestnut fell,” and Bill replies
“Yes, damn him, I had five bob on him.” And
the rider, gasping like a crushed chicken, is carried
into the casualty-room and laid on a little stretcher,
while outside the window the bookmakers are
roaring “ Four to one bar one,” and the racing is
going on merrily as ever.
* * * *
Which remarks may serve to introduce
one of the fraternity who may be considered as
typical of all. He was a small, wiry, hard-
featured fellow, the son of a stockman on a big
cattle-station, and began life as a horse-breaker —
he was naturally a horseman, and able and willing
to ride anything that could carry him. Then he
left the station to go with cattle on the road, and,
having picked up a horse that showed pace,
amused himself by jumping him over fences.
Then he went to Wagga and entered the horse m
a steeplechase, rode him himself, won handsomely,
sold the horse at a good price to a Sydney buyer,
and went down to ride the horse in his Sydney
races. Did very well in Sydney, and got a name
as a fearless and clever rider, and was offered
several mounts on fine animals, so he pitched his
camp in Sydney and became a fully-enrolled mem-
ber of the worst profession in the world —that of
steeplechase-rider. I had known him in the old
days on the road, and when I met him on the
course one day I inquired how he liked the new
life.
“ Well, it’s a livin’,” he said, but it s no great
shakes. They don’t give steeplechase-riders a
chance in Sydney” (which is true enough).
“ There is very few races, and the big sweep-
stakes keep horses out of the game.” •
“ Do you get a fair share of the riding ? I
“Oh, yes; I get as much as anybody. But
there’s a lot of ’em got a notion I won’t take hold
of a horse when I’m told ( i.c ., pull him to prevent
him winning), but some of these days 111 take
hold of a horse when they don’t expect it.”
I smiled as I thought there was probably a
sorry day in store for some backer when the
jockey “ took hold ” unexpectedly.
“ Do you have to pull horses, then, to get em-
ployment ? ” „ , . , .
“ Oh, well, it’s this way, he said, rather apolo-
getically, “if an owner is badly treated by the
handicapper, and is just giving his horse a run to
get weight off, then it’s right enough to catch hold
a bit. But when a horse is favorite and the public
are backing him it isn’t right to take hold of him
then. I would not do it.” This was his whole
code of morals—not to pull a favorite : and he felt
himself very superior to the scoundrel who would
pull favorites or outsiders indiscriminately. >
“What do you get for riding? ” I asked him.
“ Well,” he said, looking about uneasily, “we’re
supposed to get a fiver for a losing mount and ten
pounds if we win, but such a lot of the steeple-
chase-owners are what I call ‘ battlers ’—men
who have no money and get along by owing every-
body money. They promise us all sorts of money
if we win but they don’t pay if we lose. I only
got two pounds for that last steeplechase.”
Two pounds ! I made a rapid mental calcula-
tion. He had ridden over eighteen fences for two
pounds—had chanced his life eighteen times at
less than half-a-crown a time.
“ Good Heavens,” I said, “that’s a poor game.
Wouldn’t you be better back on the station ?
“ Oh, I don’t know—sometimes we get laid a
bit to nothing, and do well out of a race. A/nd
then, you know, a steeplechase rider is somebody,
—not like an ordinary fellow that is just working.’
I realised that I was an “ordinary fellow who
was just working,” and felt small accordingly.
“I’m just off to weigh now,” he said —“I’m
riding Contractor, and he’ll run well, but he
always seems to fall at those logs. Still, I ought
to have luck to-day. I met a hearse as I was
coming out. I’ll get him over the fences, some-
how.”
“Do you think it lucky, then, to meet a
hearse ? ”
“Oh, yes,” he said, “if you meet it. You
mustn’t overtake it—that’s unlucky. So is a
cross-eyed man unlucky. Cross-eyed men ought
to be kept off race-courses ’’—and away he went
followed by a little knot of hungry-looking men
who were beseeching him fora “ tip ” for the race.
* * * *
When he reappeared he was clad in racing
rig, and we set off to see the horse saddled. We
found the owner in a great state of excitement.
It seemed he had no money, absolutely none what-
ever, but had borrowed enough to pay the sweep-
stakes and stood to make something if the horse
won and lose nothing if he lost, as he had nothing
to lose. My friend the rider insisted on being
paid two pounds before he would mount, and the
owner nearly had a fit in his efforts to persuade
him to ride on credit. At last a backer of the
horse came forward who agreed to pay £2 10s.,
win or lose, and the rider was to get £25 out of the
prize if he won. So up he got, and as he and the
others walked the big muscular horses round the
ring nodding gaily to friends in the crowd, I
thought of the gladiators going out to fight in the
arena with the cry of “Hail, Caesar, those about
to die salute thee ! ”
The story of the race is soon told. My friend
went to the front at the start and led nearly all
the way, and “ Contractor ! ” was on every one’s
lips as the big horse sailed along in front of his
field. He came at the log-fence full of running,
and it looked certain that he would get over. At
the last stride he seemed to falter, then plunged
right in to the fence, striking it with his chest
and turning right over it, landing on his unfor-
tunate rider. Evidently, meeting the hearse had
not brought him luck.
Man and horse lay still, and there was silence
in the stand, broken only by a few audible curses
from those who had backed the horse. A crowd
clustered round and hid horse and rider from
view, and I ran down to the casualty-room to
meet him when the ambulance came in. The gay
silks and colors were all mudspattered and blood-
stained as the limp form was carefully taken out
and laid on a stretcher while a doctor examined
the crushed ribs, the broken arm, and all the
havoc that the horse’s huge weight had made.
There was no hope from the first. My poor friend,
who had so often faced Death for two pounds,
lay very still awhile, gasping and quivering
slightly. Then he began to talk—wandering in
his mind. “ Where were the cattle ” —he had lost
the cattle—his mind evidently going back to the
old days on the road. Then he spoke quickly,
“Look out there —give me room!” and again
wandered off—“ Five-and-twenty pounds, Mary,
and a sure thing if he don’t fall at the logs.”
And “ Mary ” was sobbing beside the bed, cursing
the fence and the money that had fetched him to
grief. At last, in a tone of satisfaction, he said,
quite clear and loud: “I know how it was— there
couldn’t have been any dead man in that hearse 1 ”
And so, having solved the mystery to his own
satisfaction, he again drifted away into uncon-
sciousness—and woke somewhere on the other
side of the big fence that we can neither see
through nor over, but all have to face sooner or
later.

Lament.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Peace, your little child is dead !
Peace, I cannot weep with you 1
I have no more tears to shed,
I have mourned my baby, too—
I that ne’er was wooed or wed !
Love has looked within your eyes ;
Love has filled your hungry heart;
You have borne the babe, your prize,
You have blossomed, done your part—
Though the flower faded lies.
But to me was Love denied,
God had said it could not be :
Still my hungry hopes abide :
All the motherhood in me
Aches —and starves, unsatisfied.
How my soul has yearned for thee,
Sweet, sweet unborn child of mine !
How thy life would tenderly
Round thy mother’s life entwine —
Hope of hopes that may not be !
How thy hands would pluck my breast!
I have felt them o’er and o’er,
And thy soft, sweet skin caressed —
Baby mine I never bore !
Did I dream so ? Dreams are best!
You have nothing now to fear,
* Mother, you have fondled him,
Held his pretty face so near,
Laid your lips to each soft limb—
He is dead, but he was dear !
You have something you may mourn—
Some sweet memory to kiss ;
I am lonelier, more forlorn,
God has left me only this—
My sweet babe that was not bom.
Maoriland.

Queensland is desperately trying to foster
a leather industry chiefly for the benefit of Too-
woomba. Toowoomba leather (it is alleged) is mostly
like tin in hot weather and like tripe in the web
season. Some time ago a gentleman travelling to
England took with him a portmanteau of the
aforesaid Toowoomba material. The officers, en-
dured the vile stench it emitted from the cabin as
. i ons as possible, until one of them propounded to
the owner the poser- did all Queensland stink like
that leather ?

Matrimonial Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Poets have agreed to apotheosise courtship pre-
nuptial unfulfilled desire. The conventional
belief, the legendary idea, is that matrimony and
possession destroy the ideal and open the flood-
gates of dreary, drudging prose.
I cannot see it. .
Six years ago I married. I was not particularly
in love, though she was a sweet girl, passing fair
and tender. I cannot tell exactly why I married.
My reasons were manifold as my nature. I felt
lonely, .unappreciated. I yearned for somebody
to read my verses to, and gently smooth my fur-
rowed brow, and all that. “ I wanted some fool
to call me wise. ”
And then—the girl loved me !
Discreetly I pass over the honeymoon. When
my senses had regained their accustomed calm, I
felt some changes in the atmosphere surrounding
me. Contemplating as usual with earnest ad-
miration my own self (this is euphemistically
called the analytical habit), I remarked with
astonishment strange protuberances upon the
comer of that bright sun.
A great French astronomer discovered the
existence of an unknown planet through unac-
countable aberrations in the conduct of a neigh-
boring star. Even so, I for the first time, though
married for many months, became aware of the
existence of an outside influence powerful enough
to work silent but decisive changes in the whole
current of my thought.
The case interested me psychologically.
I could not have lived near a woman with ideas
of her. own, and would certainly not have been
influenced by her.
I had never expected my wife to stand mentally
on the same level with me. I knew she did not.
She could not reason (what woman can ?) and her
thought was not creative. Mine was, as my poems
prove .
And yet, though unable to follow me intel-
lectually, she influenced my ideas. There was in
her some natural gift, which I will call the instinct
of sympathy, that en-
abled her to accompany
me on my highest flights,
to feel with me in my
deepest and to her unin-
telligible sorrow.
Sh e seemed the connect-
ing-1 ink between nature
and the absurd position
of conceited manhood;
the root that drew life
out of Mother Earth to
feed the overgrown shoot
of artificially-forced civi-
lisation.
one: became mentally
indispensable to me.
I repaid the services
she unwittingly rendered
with such actions as I
thought would please her
most. I bought her yel-
low roses when she wore
a blue dress ; I killed her
pet dog in trying to cure
it of the results of over-
eating, at her loving
hands. And she adored
me.
Her adoration was
gratifying, and I began
to find beauty in these
little commonplaces of
connubial life. I des-
cended from my super-
lativeness, and consented
to interest myself in her
petty troubles in ex-
change for her help at
my latest poem.
She was my Inspira-
tion, though she was not
poetical. Others she
might’ have inspired to
political ambition, or
battle, or discovery.
Like beautiful music, a
food woman arouses the
test in man, independent
of her own inclinations.
The Best in me, unhap-
pily, was a capacity to
write poems —of the sort
which are never paid for.
Then she fell ill. It
did not seem serious at
first, but the disease
would not be vanquished.
For the first time in
my existence I felt the
sweetness of knowing a
being entirely dependent
on my person, my pre-
sence. I noticed, as I
had never noticed before,
the beauty of that pale,
thin face, as it lay framed
in a mass of dark hair—
the classic chiselling of
the bare arms folded
languidly on her bosom.
For hours I used to sit
beside her bed and drink
in that lovely picture, till
my soul was saturated
wi th her personality.
We spoke little, for she
was weak, and I was
happy. I was in love.
Not a love that desires,
that the poets sing about
and praise above all things
in heaven and earth. No,
my love had nothing
left to wish for. All
was mine.
But, ah! what bliss
could I not draw out of
a faint smile, a touch of
our hands, the confidence
of possession that lay in
her eyes !
Daily, steadily she was
sinking towards death.
I realised it slowly only,
by degrees. She knew it long before me, and
there was a sweet pity in her looks that often
puzzled me deeply.
Modern man, I had flattered myself, is a being
in whom civilisation has suffocated the wild,
vulgar barbarian passions. He appreciated shades,
degrees, not the glaring colors that delight the
savage and infuriate the bull.
It may be so. Perhaps lam not civilised.
But when the awful truth flashed upon me,
when suddenly I knew how I loved that woman
who was going to leave me, I verged on madness.
She grew very religious—l was an utter un-
bfeliever. But to please her I knelt at the bedside,
and prayed aloud, my voice addressing God, but
my soul the goddess I worshipped.
She seemed pained at the vehemence of my
grief, and so I tried to master myself for her sake.
I had never done so before. I think I even
managed to smile; and when I kissed her for the
last time, when her soft arms encircled my neck
and the vanishing breath touched my brow, 1
found strength to speak of a meeting hereafter.
And all the time I knew it would never be.
But then, you see, I loved. _ Not with your
selfish, prenuptial desire, but with the love that
she had taught me.
Queensland.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The coach stole round a path hewn out of
j; be grey sandstone, to the road that ran white and

number of men gathered and sent up a faint
cheer. Then a shirt of many colors, supported by
yellow moles, rose solemnly from the box-seat and
Jnade some para bolic gestures in return. The
d™ touched hi ß leader tenderly on the flank
and the coach wound through lichen-covered
boulders into a dingy mulga background. Simul-
fcaneously the crowd below adjourned to the pub.
mottle-faced old “whaler” peeped in at the
door to remark, for the fifth time, that “ water
was bad, and the road too strnkin’ for anything,
one noticed him until, pressed by a great
thirst, he hazarded another cast of the die :

song without funny business . Ever eard, When
Molly marries the Ringer ? ’ I’d sing ‘ Billy, the
Boundry,’ only I’m gone in the ’igh notes through
sl in - in tbe wet without a bluey.”
1 .. . v
A derisive, withering reply sent him hobbling to
the kerb to examine further the grey ridges that
bounded an everlasting plain, and the question of
his life —the road. Conversation in the bar turned
upon Benjamin Stokes, the man who had just left
by coach for Sydney. Everybody admitted that
Ben was too reserved and sullen. In the first
place, his life had been spent beyond the enlighten-
ing influence of his fellow-townsmen, in long
night-watches with stamping herds and vicious
colts. “ And the result,” said Tackier, the school-
master, “ is a product as rough as Nature—his god.
Gentlemen,” continued Tackier, seizing a gin-and-
peppermint, “the man Stokes is a heathen idola-
tor.” And Mottle-face went lamely over the hill,
his tattered clothes flapping weirdly through a
vista of white dust.
* * * *
Ben’s trip was to last a month, and each
week of his absence was duly notched off on the
post outside the pub. W hen the notches grew to
ten, and he did not return, the circumstance was
referred to in the Deep Ckeek Dabbler.
Ben had never seen a train before ; his ideas of
city life had been drawn from the rough word-
pictures of bushmen. The cause of his prolonged
absence was explained in the first page of his new
pocket-book —
Stoping two teeth, one ginny. Millysent Lee—cab—
mattrymonal agency, 3£ 2s. 6d.
* * * *
One afternoon the coach dropped them at
the door of a hut near the creek. The driver shook
hands with Ben, winked at Ben’s wife, and flogged
his horses over the wooden bridge to the township.
A tabby cat brought out several blind kittens for
inspection, exhibiting a sinful pride which led to
painful consequences, for a few minutes later an
anxious mother mewed piteously near the tank,
while Benjamin did strange things with her blind
offspring in a bucket of water. Millicent threw
herself wearily on a biscuit-box and slowly took
out her hat-pins. The room was stuffy and
dark ; the tiny window and the little tin mirror
filled her with a profound astonishment. In a
corner was a narrow bed that met the require-
ments of a long, single man, and its presence
plainly indicated that the whole wedlock business
was unpremeditated. A sporting print on the
wall depicted “Jimmy the Biff” going sweet and
fresh after ten hard rounds with “Mick the
Nipper ” from Bendigo.
Through a large hole in the wall near the fire-
place Ben apologised for the speckled condition of
the nuptial chamber—due, he explained, to the
goats and fowls. By-and-bye he might nail up the
hole with a bag ;it was getting too big. Some
night an enterprising cow would squeeze through
and breathe over a married couple—he’d nail it
up now. He rushed away, and there were sounds
of a man chopping wood.
The following day was Sunday, and the
new wife hinted weakly about going to church.
“ Right, Mill,” said Ben, dropping the saw he was
greasing, “ we’ll go now, though I’ve never been
before. Put on your grey dress and the hat with
the big black feather. ”
He chose a seat directly under the pulpit.
“ Keep yer ’ead agin the mahogany, Mill; they’ll
be dyin’ to see yer face when they come in; don’t
let ’em.”
The church at this time was empty; but it
filled—filled to overflowing. “ Don’t forgit the
mahogany, Mill,” whispered Ben behind his
hand.
Their pew remained as sacred as a Hindu cow.
The coach-driver pointed them out from a crowded
porch, and his audience appeared spasmodically
grateful for the information concerning Mrs. Ben.
The driver admitted regretfully that his friend,
Sam Hopkins, knew her pretty well, thanks —
“wished he knew her as well.” Still, it wasn’t
for him to take away the character of a respectable
married woman. Heard that she could cook as
blanky good a feed as anybody in Pyers,
and if . The organ took it up, and sent out a
moaning “ Adeste Fideles.”
The minister thundered at his stoic congrega-
tion, and charged the air with strange, charitable
precepts. At the end he waved a calm benedic-
tion over his respectable flock: “Go in peace and
sin no more.”
The men leered at Ben and Mill as they passed
out; young girls gathered up skirts and scattered;
obese wives and mothers cannoned in circling,
agitated groujis.
“Thank God the roof didn’t fall upon us this
blessed day ! The idea ! ”
Ben lifted his head and eyed the hostile gather-
ing ; some of them had known him for years—
since the time when he used to drive about Pyers
in a billy-goat tandem. A shout of mocking
laughter followed them to the gate. Ben shut his
mouth; an unknown shame spread to his neck
and face ; something gripped his arm, and a word
hummed in his ear that an ordinary woman never
uses at any period of her life.
So they tramped along, voiceless and sullen,
through paddocks where flowers nodded to a
caressing wind, while the sun warmed per-
fumes from the moist Spring earth. Mill’s right
hand bruised her breast savagely ; the other held
his sleeve.
* * * *
She glanced furtively at him across the
room—his head down, his chin resting in the heel
of his palm.
“ Did I ever say that I was a good girl, Ben ? I
ain’t, Gawd ’elp me ! ”
She thrust herself beside him, shaking and
trembling. Then Benjamin Stokes listened,
almost for the first time in his life, to the com-
monest story in the world—a betrayal, a little
shame, a gradual hardening, a world-defiance.
“The old woman at
the boardin’-house said
she’d clear me out unless
I was obligin’ and civil
to the gentlemen. So
there was presents for
Mill, and gloves planted
in my bed. ... It all
helped to take my head
away from the damned
’ard scrubbin’. I ain’t
old—seventeen ain’t very
old, is it ? Gimme a
chance, Ben—gimme a
chance!”
* * *
Something simmered
in the fireplace; plates
clattered ; a shadowy girl
moved about him all the
afternoon in a dull, half-
fTightened way. He
stumbled outside to the
wood-heap, and tile soft-
eyed collie hung at his
heels for a word
The sun dropped to
the edge of the plains,
drenching the far-off hills
with yellow mists. A
rush of cool air brought
the clang of bells; he
raised a rough and hag-
gard face and spoke a
word to the night a
word h e used wh e n
punching cattle through
an overflow. The dog
fawned joyou s 1 y—
“Away, you beast!”—
and a savage kick sent it
howling down the track.
A candle flickered in
the little bedroom, throw-
ing a shape across the
chintz curtain. “That
bell again ! ” He walked
a short, distance from the
house. How everyone
knew now everyone
guessed the truth ! What
had happened at the
church to-day would hap-
pen again with sickening
regularity. He might
force the men to respect
him with his fists, but
that cackling brood in the
porch . . . ! He struck
a match and groped into
the room to fling a word
of hate at this Magdalen
—and fell into a chair,
silenced. The face was
so pretty, so weak—prey
for every libertine. The
minister had said some-
thing about a woman who
wiped the feet of Christ
with her long meshes of
hair; nobody believed it,
of course; if they did,
why was Mill treated as
she had been? He sat
through the long night,
heavy-browed and brood-
ing, until a grey light
from the east whitened
the window-pane.
“ Mill! ” She smiled
sleepily at the word.
‘ ‘ Mill ! ” The sound
of his voice made her
crouch on the rough
pallet; she stared at the
white haggard face in the
half-light.
“Don’t be tTightened,
Mill —don’t be fright-
ened ; I shan’t hit yer.
I’ve been thinkin’ ; and
we ain’t goin’ to church
again to let ’em worry
us. I’ll build another
place overat RedPointon
the hundred-acre patch ; if they come over there
to carry on I’ll be about to receive ’em.”
Her face was hidden from him, but her hand
crept into his big palm.
* * * *
A few hours later Ben led a bay horse to
the front and hopped into the saddle. She came
to the door, her white arms splashed with milk
and flour.
“ It’s a long way to the Point, ain’t it, Ben? ”
“Yeh!”
She stole nearer—obviously to examine the
horse. He threw himself forward and kissed her
on the lips.

The Restitution of Dan Mayne,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dickson could not understand it. He had watched
day and night till he was weary, and yet had
seen or heard nothing that explained the mystery.
His fruit when ripe for market, his poultry and
cattle when fat to kill, had a trick of vanishing,
melting into memories, in a way not to be ex-
plained by flying-foxes, native cats and dingoes.
He dared not suspect his neighbors—good, kind,
genial hearts —it revolted his soul
even to doubt their honesty. Yet
sundry hints dropped by the travel-
ling storekeeper made him uneasy.
But time passed bringing neither
trace nor sign. He worked and
waited.
* * * *
It was night. Dickson had gone
to bed and was dozing off, when he
was startled by a rapping at the door.
‘ ‘ Who’s there ? ” he shouted through
the slabs.
“ It’s me, Mr. Dickson. Mother
says will you come down and see
dad—he’s real bad and like to die?”
Dickson, recognising the voice,
arose and admitted the visitor, young
Martin Mayne, looking as stolid and
apathetic as usual. “ What’s
the matter with your father ?”
enquired Dickson as he hur-
ried on his clothes.
“Wo don't know at all, at
all ; but he is powerful bad to be
sure.”
They hurried down the track in the darkness,
or rather Dickson strove to hasten, for Martin
would not move from his accustomed pace. As
they neared the house there were manifest signs
of. Dan’s sickness. On the hill, half a mile away,
they could hear his shrieks and groans. “ Holy
Mary ! have mercy on us ! Holy Mother of God !
deliver us ! Holy and blessed saints help me, a
poor sinner! ”
Dickson grew impatient with concern, but
Martin still walked deliberately. “Is there no
one with your father ? ”
“Yes, there’s Fred Jones and George, Abe
Sinclair, Long Dave, and Old Fergusson, and
Sid.’s gone for the Murphys, but I don’t know if
they’ve come ; and I sang out to Garvan as I came
to your place.”
“ Why, you’ve got nearly everybody.”
“ Yes,” said Martin, with the first sign of emo-
tion ; “ we’ve got most of the people about here.”
* * * *
They entered the house by the kitchen, a big
room for a bush house—but the Mayne family was
large, and they were all there with the neighbors
Martin had mentioned. Two candles lighted the
crowd, who were talking and joking merrily, while
a group round the table played cards, quite re-
gardless of the groans and cries from the next
room.
“Would you like to see Dan?” enquired Mrs.
Mayne, coming forward.
Dickson nodded wonderingly, and wa3 shown
into the siek man’s room. One of the
daughters sat by the side of the bed, wherein the
patient rolled and twisted like one of the damned.
“ Holy, blessed ! Is that you, Mr. Dickson ?
I’m glad you’ve come ! I’m glad you’ve come ! ”
Then another spasm took the old man, and he
roared out, “ Holy Mary ! ”
(And, like a mocking echo, a voice came from
the next room : “ I make it hearts and go alone.”)
“I’m a dead man, Mr. Dickson, and I wouldn’t
be after dying with sin on my soul. Holy and
blessed Peter, have pity on me ! ”
“Where is the painenquired Dickson, sym-
pathetically.
(The voice in the next room answered: “I’ve
euchred you, by gum ! ”)
“ Holy Saints ! But I’m a dead man, Mr. Dick-
son. It’s stiff and cold I’ll be in the morning, and
it’s confession I’d make before I die. D’ye mind
them two unbranded heifers of yours ? ”
Dickson nodded.
“ It’s myself ran them in with the last mob I
took to Penrith, and it’s your forgiveness I want,
and I’ll make it right with you.”
“Very well,” said Dickson, somewhat taken
aback. “I’ll—l’ll forgive you.”
(From the next room came a hubbub of voices.
“ I pass.” “ Me, too.” “ And I make it clubs.”
“ Then you’re euchred, as sure as you’re born ! ’’)
“Give us your hand on it, sonny—Holy Mother,
have mercy on me ! There was six bits of hens
and a rooster —perhaps you mind them, Mr. Dick-
son ? I took them in a bag one night. You’ll be
after forgiving me for that ? ”
“What! the fowls, too ? ”
“Only a few bits of chickens,” said Dan, in a
tone almost offended.
“ Well, I forgive you the fowls. But where did
you sell them ? ’’
(“There’s the left-bower, anyhow; that’s good
enough for you.”)
“ It’s after knowing who had them you’d be? ”
And Dan’s little eyes gleamed suspiciously.
“ Never you mind ! Never you mind ! I’ll make
it right with you. Holy Mary ! Holy Virgin ! ”
“I think, Mrs. Mayne,” said Dickson to the
wife, who had just come in, “ hot fomen-
tations might do him some good.”
“Do you think so, now? I was after
trying myself, but Dan is that obstinate.”
The remedy-was tried, the pain eased, and in S
few minutes Daniel dozed off to sleep. Dickson,
seeing no more to be done, declined the cordial in-
vitation to make another hand at euchre, and went
home and to bed again. The next day, calling at
Mayne’s to see how the old man was, he found
him seated in the fireplace.
“ How are you this morning, Mr. Mayne?”
“ Powerful bad, to be sure,” said Dan, making a
face, “ it’s the trouble of the world I had to eat a
bit of breakfast.” Then Dan groaned, drew his
mouth down, and, after a pause—“ I was after
telling you last night about a heifer of yours I took
away in mistake.”
“ Two heifers,” corrected Dickson.
“ One ! Why, man alive, don’t you think I
know two from one ? It was a poor little thing ;
sure to have died the winter —but never you mind,
I’ll make it right with you. That red cow of mine
is near calving, and you shall have the calf,” cried
Dan, benevolently.
“ But you said two heifers,” objected Dickson.
“ Now, do you want to take advantage of a poor
map when he’s sick? It’s the three little bits of
liens you’re thinking of. Never you mind, never
you worry about that. Til make them right with
you.”
The days passed. Dan got about again. The
red cow’s accouchement passed off as successfully
as a royal birth, and Dickson regarded the calf
from time to time with the feeling of future pos-
session.
It was December. Dan’s bush caught fire, and
Dickson ran with other neighbors to help beat it
out. They were glowing hot, steaming with per-
spiration when it was over, and Dan walked with
YJ V!? n £ lie cree^-
hand at a of °you & And
there’s that pair of fowls I owe you. Never you
trouble about them. The old woman’s got a pair

BATSMAN (who has hit the ball into the river) to his partner: “ Run , Billy! That
cove can't swim, and we can yet a hundred while they're fishing for his

“ And the calf?” interrogated Dickson.
_ “ Well, I never see such a greedy man. Ain’t I
giving you a pair of splendid pullets, and besides,
the oalf is a bull calf, and I wouldn’t be after ask-
ing you so much as to look at it.”
» * * •
Time passed, but neither pullets nor calf were
sent up from Dan Mayne’s, nor did Dickson’s
portables seem more stable than of yore. It was
about a year later that Dickson’s sleep was again
interrupted by a rapping at the door. Martin was
there as he had been before, and with a still
more urgent message to summon Dickson
to the death-bed of his father.
“I don’t see how I can do him any
good. I’m no doctor.”
“ You put him right last time,” said
Martin in a tone almost reproachful.
It seemed to Dickson that, as
they got near the house, the howls
and groans proceeding therefrom
were louder than they had been
before— a storm of yells and
A SAFE ANSWER.
FATHER: “ What was the sermon about to-night?”
DAUGHTER (who went far a walk with her boy instead of to church) : “ Oh, about the
debt on the church and collecting money for the heathen! ”
screeches interspersed with appeals to the
Saints and the Holy Family. In the kitchen
the same crowd were playing euchre, as though
they had never left the table since he had last seen
them there. In the bed-room Dan writhed in
agony. _
“ I tried the hot fomentations,” whispered Mrs.
Mayne, “an’ devil a bit o’ good did they do him
this time. I’ve sent for Father O’Halligan, but
it’s doubting I am his reverence will come at all,
at all. You see the last time he came Dan was
having his breakfast, and his reverence was
mightily disappointed.”
“Is that you ?” said Dan in a pause between
his groans; “sure I’m settled this time safe
enough, and it’s rather stone-dead I’d be twenty
times over than suffer the like. And it’s me con-
science pricks me sore, Mr. Dickson, and the
weight of me sins. Lord have mercy on me !
you'd only forgive me I’d die aisier in my moind.”
“Why, did I not forgive you long ago, Mr.
Mayne ? ”
1 It’s the little heifer you’d be speaking of, an’
the bits of chickens. Never you mind about them
—l’ll lave you them in my will. It’s that roan
bullock and the pumpkins on the flat, I’d be
speaking about. ”
“You don't mean to say !” interrupted
Dickson.
“ Now don’t you be hard on a dying man. I’ll
make it up to you. Not a penny shall you lose,
not a penny! and ere Dickson could answer Dan
had gone off into convulsions again, his groans so
heart-rending that even the card-players subdued
their raucous voices for a while.
“ Oh, what shall I do, Mr. Dickson ? sure Dan’s
sinking fast!
“ Had you not better send for the doctor ? ”
Tears were in the wife’s eyes, sobs in her voice,
as she called Mike to harness up the spring-cart.
“ Oh, dear ! Oh, dear ! Holy saints have mercy
on us ! ” She went to some recess in the bedroom
and brought out an old stocking from which she
began to count out gold and silver money.
“ Five pounds ! five pounds! It’s a robbery,
Mr. Dickson, that’s what it is, to charge a poor
body a pound a mile.”
At the clink of the coins Dan stopped groaning.
At thq, sight of the money he fairly screeched.
“ What’s that?”
“Sure it’s the money for the doctor, no less.”
“ It’s a doctor you’re getting, a doctor ! And you
think I could rest quiet in my grave if you gave
five pounds to a doctor ! Holy Virgin ! Five
pounds for a doctor ! And you'want me to die
ruined, so you do ! ”
At. this moment the noise of the spring-cart
drawing up to the house was audible.
“ What’s that? ” cried Dan.
“It’s Mike with the cart, to be sure.”
“ And it’s going to the doctor he is, with five of
my pounds ! Bad luck to him ! Do you think I’d
die at the cost of five pounds ! Bad luck to you ! ”
And the old man, his mouth full of imprecations,
jumped from the bed, huddled on his clothes,
rushed out of the house, unharnessed the horse,
and would not come back again till he had locked
up the stable and hidden the key.

Two months after this night Dickson sold out
his selection to a man from Sydney ; but, amongst
the numerous assets handed over, he failed to
mention his reversionary interest in two heifers,
seven fowls, one bullock, and a ton or two of
pumpkins.

Hanging and Hell .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are at least six Hanging Rocks and three
Gallows Hills in New South Wales. There is one
Hell. I’ve been there, thus :
Assize time in Wagga Wagga and a man on
trial for murder. Another man, myself, on trial
of sobriety, dead broke, hat battered, boots un-
laced, swag all no-how, and so nervous that the
gambolling of Pop scares me. Funny that that
animal is never so delighted as when I shoulder
bluey. I pass the court-house; a knot of idlers
are round the gate, a policeman conies out and
says, “They’ll hang him.” I’m off like a shot,
and in my ears the din of “hang him, bangin’,
bangin’, hang, ’ang, ’ng—ng—ng.” Then I turn
a corner to get out of public gaze. Unluckily, I
pass the side door of the building. I am spell-
bound ; there I see an awful visage, a face with
such a ghastly mouth, and such a dress below the
mouth, for the mouth has taken charge of the face,
like the Cheshire Cat’s grin in Wonderland. Then
the grin and the hair, the mouth and the gown,
the words and the black cap take me by the
shoulders and elsewhere and hustle me on to the
river bank. “Hang, hang, hang—ng—ng,” and
now Ive got them. I know they're on me and so
does Pop, because he whines and fawns on me.
But for Pop I’d have shown the horrors. Now I
only feel them.
Then I walk and walk and walk. It seems two
days, but it's not so wearisome, because I have
music, that rhythm, you know, always in my ears.
It’s company if it’s horrible, and the dog is some
consolation. Next, I find myself by a vineyard
full of angels ; they give me three 'tumblers of
wine and a bottle for the road. They wish me to
stay, and see me through iny recovery, but—that
grin, that mug, that wig, and the little black cap !
I’m off.
Again I travel about a week, in my mind’s eye,
and camp near an old shed under a tree. There’s
a paling fence near, and it looks like the bars of a
cage or prison.
But the tree—the gallo.vs-tree ! The boughs are
scraggy, and the leaves white on top ; there’s a
break m the middle, and a guard round the barrel.
It looks like that head. The gap is the cavernous
mouth, and the soughing of the breeze is “ Hang
him, they’ll hang him ! ”
Still, I’m not so badly off. I can see an angel
or two feeding Pop. A man comes down with a
pint of tea and a plate of soup. He tells me this
is the “ Burnt Hut,” and that the fires are Hell.
Just then he’s called by the overseer, and says
“Hang him.” Now I’m off again. The din
begins, the tree shivers, the head wags, the mug
mutters, some crows perch on the top and make a
black cap, and I fall asleep near the paling fence
—the prison cage.
When I wake I look through. I see Pop,
watching my swag on the other side, and a man
tying the legs of a sheep. That sheep is, to me,
myself. He skins it, and calls to his mate, “ Come
and help me to hang him.” The wretch is going
to hang me, the same good fellow who gave me
the soup. Luckily, I spot the bottle of wine. I
reach for it and drink it, holding the bottle by the
neck. I know that I am being hung—hanged, I
mean; but I’m not going to let them touch me,
myself, the “ alter ego.” They come near me and
fetch the overseer, who brings me a nip of the real
Mackay. It is now a little funny : I’m hung, and
still drinking whisky, and the hangman isn’t so
bad. I suppose the overseer’s the devil, because he
says, in a sort of pitying tone, “ Well ! isn’t this
hell?”
Another snooze, and I awake, it ought to be
dark, but it isn’t. The night is lit up by bush
fires on and around a pinnacle of smoke and flame.
We can see the timbers falling, the sparks rising.
“We” are the men and I. I can see the wig and the
mouth and the grin and the corpse, standing out
with red lights on a murky background. A
calico shroud has been tied round the sheep, and
it now looks like a suspended ghost, i fancy its
soul is gone to—well, blazes was my thought.
Then I become sure of it, because the overseer-
the devil, I mean—calls the men to look at the
Hanging Rock, the pillar of fire, and tells them or
half asks them, “ Isn’t it hell ? ” What with the
Hanging and the Hell, I start again (mentally),
and have my little song of “ Hang him, hang him,
hell, ell, well—not so bad—hang- hell.”
And I awoke; and behold, it was a dream.
“Well, old fellow! Are you better? Can you
cook ? Can have a job, if you like. Only me and
some fencers. We’re out all day. Tackle it to-
morrow. I’ll give you a nip or two - I’ve had ’em
myself.”
But there are few overseers like the one who
used to be at the Burnt Hut, under the Hang-in?
Rock. Isn’t it hell ?

“ Cupid, child, to me discover
Why I worship Mary, feeling
I am not her heart’s king-lover,
But a slave, allowed to hover
Near her gracious form, revealing
All my weakness and my pain ?
Must I still her slave remain,
Knowing well I love in vain—
Though on heights of wise disdain
Fain I’d live and die above her ?”
“ Lackaday ! ” quoth Cupid, sadly ;
“Often have I seen, with wonder,
Sweetest women fondling madly
Men who taste and quit them gladly.
Nature, angered by her blunder,
Sometimes bids a maiden cool,
Worldly wise, or fresh from school,
Wind a love-yarn round a spool
Just for pastime. Luckless fool.
Doth your heart ache very badly ? ”

White-when-he's-wanted.
A STATION SKETCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Buckalong was a big freehold of some 80,000 acres,
belonging to an absentee syndicate, and therefore
run in most niggardly style. There was a manager
on <£2oo a-year, Sandy M'Gregor to wit—a hard-
headed old Scotchman known as “ four-eyed
M'Gregor,” because he wore spectacles. For
assistants, he had half-a-dozen of us jackeroos
and colonial-experieneer.
—who got nothing a year,
and earned it. We had,
in most instances, paid
premiums to learn the
noble art of squatting,
which now appears to me
hardly worth studying,
for so much depends on
luck that a man with
a head as long as a horse’s
has little better chance
than the fool just im-
ported. Besides the man-
ager and the jackeroos,
there were a few bound-
ary-riders to prowl round
the fences of the vast
paddocks. This consti-
tuted the whole station
staff.
Buckalong was on one
of the main routes by
which stock were taken
to market, or from the
plains to the tablelands,
and vice - versa. Great
mobs of travelling sheep
constantly passed through
the run, eating up the
grass and vexing the soul
of the manager. By law,
sheep must travel six
miles per day, and they
must keep within half-a-
mile of the road. Of
course, we kept all the
grass near the road eaten
bare, to discourage travel-
lers from coming that
way. Such hapless
wretches as did venture
through Buckalong used
to try hard to stray from
the road and pick up a
feed, but old Sandy was
always ready for them,
and would have them
dogged right through the
run. This bred feuds,
and bad language, and
personal combats between
us and the drovers, whom
we looked upon as natural
enemies. Then the men
who came through with
mobs of cattle used to
pull down the paddock
fences at night, and
slip the cattle in for
refreshments; but old
Sandy often turned out at
2 or 3 a.m. to catch a big
mob of bullocks in the
horse-paddock, and then
off they went to Buckalong pound. The drovers,
as in duty bound, attributed the trespass to
accident —broken rails, and so on —and sometimes
they tried to rescue the cattle, which again bred
strife and police-court summonses.
• * • ■
Besides having a particular aversion to drovers,
old M'Gregor had a general “ down ” on the young
“colonials,” whom he comprehensively described
as a “feckless, horse-dealin’, horse-stealin’, crawlin’
lot o’ wretches. ” According to him, a native would
sooner work a horse to death than work for a
living, any day. He hated any man who wanted
to sell him a horse. “As ah walk the street,” he
used to say, “the folk disna stawp me to buy
claes nor shoon, an’ wheerfore should they stawp
me to buy horses ? It’s ‘ Mister M'Gregor, will
ye purrchase a horrse ’ ? Let them wait till I ask
them to come wi’ theer horrses.”
Such being his views on horseflesh and drovers,
we felt no little excitement when one Sunday, at
dinner, the cook came in to say there was a
drover-chap outside wanted the boss to come and
have a look at a horse.” M'Gregor simmered
a,while, and muttered something about the “ Saw-
bath day ”; but at last he went out, and we filed
after him to see the fun.
The drover stood by the side of his horse, beneath
the acacia trees in the yard. He had a big scar on
his face, apparently the result of collision with a
tree ; and seemed poverty-stricken enough to dis-
arm hostility. Obviously, he was “ down on his
luck.” He looked very thin and sickly, with
clothes ragged and boots broken. Had it not
been for that indefinable self-reliant look which
drovers—the Ishmaels of the bush—always acquire,
one might have taken him for a swagman. His
horse was in much the same plight. A ragged,
unkempt pony, pitifully poor and very footsore—
at first sight, an absolute “ moke,” but a second
glance showed colossal round ribs, square hips,
and a great length of rein, the rest hidden beneath
a wealth of loose hair. He looked like “ a good
journey horse,” possibly something better.
We gathered round while M'Gregor questioned
the drover. The man was monosyllabic to a
degree, as real bushmen generally are. It is only
the rowdy and the town-bushy that is fluent of
speech.
“Good morning,” said M'Gregor.
“ Mornin’, boss,” said the drover, shortly.
“ Is this the horrse ye have for sale ? ”
“Yes.”
“ Aye,” and M'Gregor looked at the pony with
a business-like don’t-think-much-of-him air; ran
his hand lightly over the hard legs, and opened
the passive creature’s mouth. “ H’m, ’he said.
Then he turned to the drover. “Ye seem a bit
oot o’ luck. Ye’re thin like. What’s been the
matter ? ”
“Been sick with fever—Queensland fever. Just
come through from the North. Been out on the
Diamantina last.”
“ Aye. I was there mysel’,” said M'Gregor.
“ Have ye the fever on ye still? ”
“ Yes —goin’ home to get rid of it.”
It should be explained that a man can only get
Queensland fever in a malarial district, but he can
carry it with him wherever he goes. If he stays,
it will sap all his strength and pull him to pieces ;
if he moves to a better climate, the malady moves
with him, leaving him only by degrees, and
coming back at regular intervals to rack, shake,
burn, and sweat its victim. Queensland fever will
pull a man down from 15st. to 9st. faster, and
with greater certainty, than any system of dosing
yet invented. Gradually it wears itself out, often
wearing its patient out at the same time.
M‘Gregor had been through the experience, and
there was a slight change in his voice as he went
on with the palaver.
“ Where are ye makin’ for the noo ? ”
“ Monaro—my people live in Monaro.”
“ How will ye get to Monaro if ye sell the
horrse ? ”
“ Coach and rail. Too sick to care about
ridin’,” said the drover, while a wan smile flitted
over his yellow-grey features, “ I’ve rode him far
enough. I’ve rode that horse a thousand miles.
I wouldn’t sell him, only I’m a bit hard-up. Sellin’
him now to get the money to go home.”
“ How old is he? ”
“Seven.”
“Is he a good horse on a camp”? asked
M'Gregor.
“No better camp horse in Queensland, said the
drover. “You can chuck the reins on his neck,
an’ he’ll cut out a beast by himself.”
M‘Gregor’s action in this matter puzzled us.
We spent our time crawling after sheep, and a
camp horse would be about as much use to us as
side-pockets to a pig. We had expected Sandy to
rush the fellow off the place at once, and we
couldn’t understand how it was that he took so
much interest in him. Perhaps the fever-racked
drover and the old camp horse appealed to him in
a way to us incomprehensible. We had never
been on the Queensland cattle-camps, nor shaken
and shivered with the fever, nor lived the roving
life of the overlanders. M'Gregor had done all
this, and his heart (I can see it all now) went out
to the man who brought the old days back to him.
“ Ah, weel,” he said, “ we hae’na much use for a
camp horrse here, ye ken; wi’oot some of these
lads wad like to try theer han’ cuttin’ oot the
milkers’ cawves frae their mithers.” And the old
man laughed contemptuously, while we felt hum-
bled and depraved in the eyes of the man from
far back. “ An’ what’ll ye be wantin’ for him ? ’
asked M'Gregor. .
“Reckon lie’s worth 15 notes,” said the drover.
This fairly staggered us. Our estimates had
varied between 30s. and a fiver. We thought the
negotiations would close abruptly, but M'Gregor,
after a little more examination, agreed to give the
price, provided the saddle and bridle, both grand
specimens of ancient art, were given in. This was
agreed to, and the drover was sent off to get his
meals in the hut before leaving by the coach.
“ The mon is verra hard-up, an it’s a sair tiling
that Queensland fever,” was the only remark that
M'Gregor made. But we knew that there was a
soft spot in his heart somewhere.
* * * •
And so, next morning, the drover got a crisp-
looking cheque, and departed by coach. He said
no word while the cheque was being written, but,
as he was going away, the horse happened to be in
the yard, and he went over to the old comrade
that had carried him so many miles, and laid a
hand on his neck. “He ain’t much to look at,”
said the drover, speaking slowly and awkwardly,
“but he’s white when he’s wanted.” And just
before the coach rattled off, the man of few words
leant down from
the box and nod-
ded impressively,
and repeated,
“ Yes, he’s white
when he’s want-
ed.”
We didn’t trouble to give the new horse a name.
Station horses are generally called after the man
from whom they are bought. “Tom Devine,”
“The Regan mare,” “Black M‘Carthy,” and
“ Bay M'Carthy ” were amongst the appellations
of our horses at that time. As we didn’t know the
drover’s name, we simply called the animal “ The
new horse ” until a still-newer horse was one day
acquired. Then, one of the hands being told to
take the new horse, said, “ D’yer mean the new
new horse or the old ‘ new horse ’? ” “ No,” said
the boss, “ not the new horse—that bay horse we
bought from the drover. The one he said was
white when he was wanted.’
And so, by degrees, the animal came to be
referred to as the horse that’s white when he’s
wanted, and at last settled down to the definite
name of “ White-when-he’s-wanted.”
« * * *
White-when-he’s-wanted didn’t seem much of
an acquisition. He was sent out to do slavery for
Greenhide Billy, a boundary-rider who plumed
himself on having once been a cattle-man. After
a week’s experience of “ White,” Billy came in to
the homestead disgusted—the pony was so lazy
that he had to build a fire under him to get him to
move, and so rough that it would make a man’s
nose bleed to ride him more than a mile. “ The
boss must have been off his head to give 15 notes
for such a cow.”
M‘Gregor heard this complaint. “ Verra weel,
Mr. Billy,” said he, hotly, “ye can just tak’ one
of the young horrses in yon paddock, an’ if he
bucks wi’ ye, an’ kills ye, it’s yer ain fault.
Ye’re a cattle-man—so ye say —dommed if ah
believe it. Ah believe ye’re a dairy-farmin’ body
frae Illawarra. Ye don't know neither horrse nor
cattle. Mony’s the time ye never rode buck-
jumpers, Mr. Billy ’’—and with this parting-shot
the old man turned into the house, and White-
when-he’s-wanted came back to the head station.
For a while he was a sort of pariah. He used to
yard the horses, fetch up the cows, and hunt
travelling sheep through the run. He really was
lazy and rough, and we all decided that Billy s
opinion of him was correct, until the day came to
make one of our periodical raids on the wild horses
in the hills at the back of the run. Every now
and again we formed parties to run-in some of
these animals, and, after nearly galloping to death
half-a-dozen good horses, we would capture three
or four brumbies, and bring them in triumph to
the homestead. These we would break-in, and,
by the time they had thrown half the crack riders
on the station, broken all the bridles, rolled on all
the saddles, and kicked all the dogs, they would
be marketable (and no great bargains) at about
30s. a head.
Yet there is no sport in the world to be men-
tioned in the same volume as “running horses,”
and we were very keen on it. All the crack nags
were got as fit as possible, and fed-up beforehand,
and on this particular occasion White-when-he’s-
wanted, being in good trim, was given a week’s
hard-feed and lent to a harum-scarum fellow from
the Upper Murray, who happened to be working
in a survey-camp on the run. How he did open
our eyes. He ran the mob from hill to hill, from
range to range, across open country and back
again to the hills, over flats and gullies, through
hop-scrub and stringybark ridges ; and all the
time White-when-he „-wanted was on the wing
of the mob, pulling
double. The mares and
foals dropped out, then
the colts and young stock
pulled up deadbeat, and
only the seasoned veterans
of the mob were left.
Most of our horses caved
in altogether ; one or two
were kept in the hunt by
judicious nursing and
shirking the work, but
White-when'- he’s-wanted
was with the quarry from
end to end of the run, do-
ing double his share ; and
at the finish, when a chance
offered to wheel them into
the trapyard, he simply
smothered them for pace,
and slewed them into the
wings before they knew
where they were. Such a
capture had not fallen to
our lot for many a day,
and the fame of White-
when- he’s -wanted was
speedily noised abroad.
He was always fit for
work, always hungry,
always ready to lie down
and roll, and always
lazy. But when he
heard the rush of the
brumbies’ feet in the
scrub, he became frantic
with excitement. He
could race over the
roughest ground without
misplacing a hoof or
altering his stride, and
he could sail over fallen
timber and across gullies
like a kangaroo. Nearly
every Sunday we were
after the brumbies, until
they got as lean as grey-
hounds and as cunning
as policemen. We were
always ready to back
White-when-he’s -wanted
to run - down, single-
handed, any animal in
the bush that we liked to
put him after wild
horses, wild cattle, kan-
garoos, emus, dingoes,
kangaroo-rats —we barred
nothing, for, if he couldn’t
beat them for pace, he
would outlast them.
* * *
And then one day he
disappeared from the pad-
dock, and we never saw
him again. We knew
there were plenty of men
in the district who would
steal him, but, as we knew
also that there were plenty
more who would ‘ ‘inform”
for a pound or two, we
were sure that it could not
have been the local “ tal-
ent ” who had taken him.
We offered good rewards
and set some of the right
sort to work, but we
heard nothing of him
for about a year.
Then the surveyor’s
assistant turned up again,
after a trip to the interior.
He told us the usual
string of backbloclc lies,
and then wound-up by
saying that out on tne very fringe of settlement he
had met an old acquaintance.

He was about the best type of sundowner I had
seen. I found him squatting under a tree at a
waterhole fronting Mt. Hutton. With the aid of
two glasses, he was cutting his hair close to the
scalp, leaving only the coating of dirt. His ex-
cuses for boots were bound together with green-
hide and wire; round his feet were pieces of
blanket which he called “Prince Alberts.”
“ What’s the next place ahead ? ” I asked him
“ Dunno.”
“ Well, what’s the manager’s name?”
“Dunno.”
He finished his bush-crop, and had a dry wash,
i.e., he wiped himself with an old shirt dirtier
than himself.
“ I never want to see bosses, let ’lone know
’em,” he remarked. “ All I want’s tucker. Gorra
match on yer?” He lit his pipe. “As for
names o’ places,” he resumed between puffs, “ C
gives ’em names o’ me own, ’cording to the treat-
ment I get there. Fust place yer come to’s
‘ Hardnut,’then yer’ll run agin’ ‘ Saltjunk,’ and,

[♦Note.— This very singular narrative occurs at the end
of a book of navigating notes found among the papers of
Capt. Close, who traded between Sydney and England
about the decade 1820-30, in command of the brigantine
Three Brothers, owned by Hutchinson and Sons, of
biverpool—a well-known firm in those days. The first
page is endorsed in the handwriting of Capt. Close,
"Obtained from a native of Easter Id., March, 1822.”
Capt. Close died in 1853, and the book—a solid old pocket-

into the possession of his daughter, Mrs L. M. Doric,
a widowed lady who is still living in Surry Hills’

on the fly-leaf, “ Thomas Finlayson, mariner,” is neatly
written in the straggling fashion of the last century,
and the entries which follow —chiefly rough calculations
and personal notes—are all in the same hand, and in ink
now faded with age. The narrative at the close is shakily
written in ink or fluid of different color, but undoubtedly

obscurities and incoherencies. It closes abruptly as

FOR THE BULLETIN.
“My name-—or the name I have always
passed by—is Thomas Finlayson,* and I was born
in 1780, at Southampton, England. I sailed in
seven ships before meeting the adventures which
began with the sailing of the convict barque
from Plymouth. I was well-born and well-
schooled, but a wild lad always—smuggler at
one time, served under Nelson at another, helped
to loot Spanish ships in the Mediterranean, and
ran before the guns of English frigates on the high
-seas. I was wounded many times, but only three
occasions I remember—once at Trafalgar, when
our guns shot fire and death ; once by a Spanish
donna when I snatched a kiss ; and again when a
sallow Yankee ran me through in a boarding
encounter.
“Sept., 1814, we weighed anchor for New
Holland. I had shipped as third mate. We
bad with us a cargo of men and women
from English gaols, a pitiful crowd who knew just
;o much of the world as was ill for them. The
vomen were almost all ugly, withered creatures,
vith souls seas-under in malice. Almost all, I
slid, but there was an exception. Aye, and she
was a wonder. She had eyes that turned you
■ound at a cable’s length, and stood you still.
When they turned on you, you trembled hard.
They were grey, some said, and some said blue,
and many held they were hazel. I—who had seen
them night and day, and felt their mischief-
know they were all these and more. Her face was
colored a dusky warmth, paling in anger to a dull
ashiness. She was slim and lithe, and the quietest
nights she’d come and stand alongside you, and
her feet would make no more noise than a feather
falling on the sea. Her name was Leah. One
time the doctor called her by her prison number,
and she looked at him. For a week after he went
about plucking the collar of his coat and twitching
his lips. How she came amongst that abandoned
crowd Ido not know. She was dumb; it was
said she had never spoken. A convict told me
she had killed a lord.
“ ‘Killed him with a kiss,' I said, and laughed.
Afterwards I knew how near the truth I had
steered when I said these words.
“ Her presence grew upon me, and I became a
slave. God made me an ill man to my enemies,
but a faultless friend to my friends. Yet at this
woman’s wish I would have buried friend and
enemy in the same death, and the world with
them. When I tell you that everyone in the ship
was likewise fascinated, a glimmering of her
beauty will strike you, and something of her bright
eyes’ magic.
“A week after we sailed from England the
captain found her out. I cursed the captain, and
the first mate cursed him, and the second, and
every one of the crew. Yet he took Leah to his
cabin and held her there, and through storm and
calm went about like a man in dreams.
“He bore a charmed life, and it was needful.
One black night a dark bulk shoved him over, but
rising with a sea he caught a rope and hauled him-
self on board. Another time a marlinspike fell
from the shrouds and bruised his arm. Some
hand stabbed him in the shoulder while he slept,
but none would say whose hand. And yet again,
while he lay ill of this wound, the doctor gave him
arsenic in place of a sleeping-powder. But no
danger could tame him or chase him from the
convict woman’s side.
“ One sunset I saw more hate on men’s faces
than is good to see. The captain and the woman
stood on the poop, gazing at the west. The men
looked at the captain, and every face was ashen
grey. Not a foot moved, each mouth was sealed.
Yet when the captain drew the woman’s head
down, folded her in his arms, and kissed her red
lips, some turned away and choked and others
hissed oaths.
“We came at length to Sydney and landed the
convicts. With them went Leah. We watched
her walking away, throwing a glance now and
again at us, and a smile flickering on her lips.
“ Then within me yawned an emptiness, and my"
heart felt vacant. I was not alone in this : we
were all a changed and cheated crew. The cap-
tain went to and fro with a sullen gloom on his face.
The two mates talked in whispers and looked
towards the shore with wistful faces. Three times
the captain went to Governor Macquarie, golden
presents in his hand. On each occasion he re-
turned pale and angry. At last came the eve of
our departure. A strange nervousness attacked
us. Our breaths came quick, we paused with
irresolute feet, our eyes gazed into vacancy. We
seemed like men bereft of sense. When a man
asked one thing, his mate answered something
different. We were a ship of absent-minded offi-
cers and dreaming crew. Our minds had gone
astray from their moorings. We wereMrifting on
aTl n U \r C^ sea > and no man knew whither.
Next day, with a real west wind, we weighed
anchor, T-he sails filled, and the ship leapt away.
Ihe captain stood by the steersman, his teeth set,
Ins body bent forward. The shore was lined by
scai let soldiers and grey convicts. We passed
h ort Macquarie, and these vanished. One by one
we cleared the tree-clad points to starboard
and ran along the scrubby shore on our left. Then,
as we rounded a point and saw the ocean before
us, a sudden gun boomed down the waters, and a
flag floated from its staff. They were telling us
that a convict had escaped. We heeded neither
their gun nor flag, but held on beneath the lash of
that hot wind, a doomed crew with a stolen prize.
* * * *
“I write of witchery, or worse. No man
was on that ship but ate his heart—none but hated
his fellow. Whipped by the gale, the ship flew
east with a breaking sea at her heels. When at
last it fell calm we were many hundred leagues
from New Holland. And now began the first of
many horrors.
A moon of burnished copper stood above the
horizon. A long swell swayed the sea. The crew
loitered about with a suppressed breathing, and a
great sultriness was abroad. The creaking timbers
and the straining cordage alone broke the stillness.
I stood by the bulwarks, a hot forehead on my
hand. Somewhere there was wine for the hungry
heart within me. A thousand curses on the knaves
that stayed it from my lips ! Suddenly a cry rang
out:
“ ‘ The doctor, quick ! ’ He came and bent over
the captain. ‘ Apoplexy !’ he exclaimed.
‘‘ The officers exchanged glances. He turned
and read them.
“ ‘I am guiltless, before God,’ he said.
“ He opened a vein in the dead man’s arm, and
started back with a pale face. The blood was
thick as jelly and black as jet !
“ ‘Gentlemen,’ he cried, ‘if this be poison ’tis
a wondrous drug.’
“We sailed away, and Leah went to the first
mate’s side. On the fourth night he, too, .stag-
gered along the deck and fell dead.
“ The doctor came and opened a vein. Again
the blood was black and thick. Then he uttered
a fearful oath, caught up his sword, and made
straight for Leah, crying out that he should kill
her. But ere he reached her the second mate ran
in, and broke his forehead with an axe. We sewed
the two bodies in one shroud, loaded it with shot,
and sank them.
“And now birds in flocks and sharks in shoals
followed in our wake, smelling blood in the breath
we breathed. Day and night they darkened the
air and whitened the underwaters of the sea. The
sun set sullenly, the moon rose in crimson, and the
stars burned red. The sky and sea at all hours
were full of portents.
“A week after the second mate followed the first,
and each man knew that the prize went to the
strong of arm.
“PEOPLE WE PUT ON THE LAND.”
HE : “ They don't look very healthy , Emily. We might
try feeding them—perhaps the old hen hasn't
milk enough for them all.”
“ How the first stroke of the fight that followed
was struck I do not know. Two men swayed from
the captain’s cabin, locked in a death-grip, and a
third stabbed them both. Then each man found
a foe and set himself a task. When the sun set
many were wounded and more killed. Men that
I had sailed with for many years lay dead or
dying, and my arms were red. Such things will
man do for a woman.
“ Then came a flash of horror. I looked on that
red scene, and loathed the heart within me.
‘This ship,’ I said, ‘ will sail to hell.’
“In the dark I lowered a boat and provisioned
it while the dead were above deck and the living
below. I took the oars and pulled away. I had
taken but a few strokes when something splashed
from the ship’s side and swam towards me. I
rested on my oars and waited. It was Leah. A
great desire rose in my heart to beat her shapely
head and sink her from man’s sight for ever.
Instead, I leaned out, caught her in my arms, and
lifted her to my side. Between the desire and the
act she had raised her eyes.
* * * *
“ Late that night a little light sparkled
north of us. At first it was no bigger than a ruby
on a velvet pall. It grew at length till the sea about
“The dumb woman sat and watched with
untiring eyes."
it glowed crimson. A tressy blaze streamed
on the wind. Cries of men in dire urgency, tierce
laughter and drunken songs came across the sea.
Again and again my heart yearned to put about
and save them, but always on the point of action
I looked on Leah and my purpose failed. There
was something in her eyes that stabbed resolve.
“ While we watched, a light shot up the sky,
and the woman clapped her hands. The ship
belched smoke and sparks. Red fragments
spattered the darkness, and the sea flushed
angrily. Then came a long, low boom and dark-
ness, and I was alone with the woman.
* » * *
“ Of the sea we now sailed into, mariners
speak with bated breath. They have named it
the Desolate Region. It lies many leagues from
land As we entered its eastern limits, the birds
of the air turned on their course and deserted us.
The sharks refused to follow further. No sign of
life broke the glassy waters.
All day the sun burned dully
in the heavens. All night the
moon sent down a dim, dead
stare. But worse than these
was the silence that shrouded
that sea. No whale spouted,
no fish splashed. Only a soli-
tary man gazed into the dumb
creature’s eyes and drank chill
draughts. When at last the
wind came it blew from many
quarters. It sent our frail
boat hither and thither till
all reckonings were lost, and
so we sailed many days.
* * *
“Last night a strange
white wonder happened. Why
did God take me from my
fellows and portion me these
weird experiences? I had
been content to die as most
men —either by man’s hand
or the Death Angel’s unseen sword. To see
death as he now approaches is to gaze on a
veiled stranger. Last night the dumb creature
crept to my side. A white moon stood in the
zenith, and the ghost of a star beside it. The
sea slept. I took the woman’s face in my
hands, and kissed her lips. Her magical eyes
gazed into mine, chaining my soul and choking
my breath. It seemed I had never loved before.
And yet deep within me an angry voice was
calling me to kill her. As I held her there
it seemed as if a sudden gust from many graves
blew in my nostrils. It was as though the dead
had opened their mouths and laughed. I
rose and looked round. My hands trembled,
my knees knocked, and I shook the woman
off. I gazed across the sea with a beating
heart. In the west many faces looked out upon
me. Grave, grey faces were they, ranged on a
white island, and staring through the night.
“ ‘ This is the Land of Death,’ I said ; ‘ for this
I was bom.’
“ Then I folded my arms and bowed my head.
But the woman would not let me be. She wound
her arms around my neck. I called on her to go,
and cursed her ; for little doubt had I that she had
brought me to this pass. She did not heed me,
but drew my head upon her lap. Her fingers
trembled through my hair. She
bent down till her hot breath
touched my neck, and then she
kissed.
“ I shoved her from me and
sprang up. Where she kissed
was as hot as fire. Her lips
were red as glowing embers and
sharp as a dagger’s point. She
crept away and crouched in the
boat’s stern, and watched me
with wild, bright eyes. The
blood raced through my veins
and a heat Hushed me.
Then, on a sudden, a cold
wind seemed to blow
through my bones and
chill their marrow.
After came a gentle
warmth and a desire
to sleep. Through
all these changes
the dumb woman
sat and watched
with untiring eyes
and a smile of
strange meaning.
‘‘ The mo o n
slipped down the
sky till she lay on
the horizon. Her
white round face peered
between the great, grey
faces in the west. I beheld
the scene with dreamy eyes,
knowing that death was nigh.
“ I sleep, and a thousand things rub
nettled skins against me. I wake, if it can be
called waking, to go from sleep to stupor, and a
hissing laughter and a rustling as of many leaves
fall faintly on my ears.
* * * *
“ Now it is clear to me how the dead men
died. The woman kissed them and their blood
thickened. Fitter for her a dank, dead wood, dark
misty caverns, and unsunned places, than a strong
man s arms and a beating heart. Better that
those eyes should glimpse behind green glistening
jungle than thus through brown tresses lure warm
flesh and blood to doom.

Othello: a Sack-Blocks Version,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We had camped, and had been talking of books
and the different characters pourtrayed in them.
“Ever read Shakespeare?” he enquired, as we
rolled together a couple of small logs, preliminary
to lighting a fire.
“ Oh, yes ! ” I replied ; “ Shakespeare was a pet
study of mine for years.”
He seemed to get interested.
“ He’s a good ’un.”
“ Not too bad,” I said.
“ That there lago was a bad egg.”
My thoughts recurred to Othello’s Ancient.
“ Yes ; lago was a bit of a villain.”
“A villain!” he muttered, as he took off his
hat and fanned some embers into flame. “He
was a fair brute, that cove was. See how he
kidded the darkie he was acting ‘ square ’ to him,
when all the time ’e was tryin’ to do ’im.”
Then he paused and looked at me.
“ I’ve met blokes like ’im ‘ out back ’ —out
back ! ” He spoke slowly, and, apparently, feel-
ingly.
I looked at him.
Then he continued : “I think that darkie cove
was square enough, and the girl, too —the one he
cleared out with an’ spliced. But that there lago
was a cow —a fair cow ! Like it strong ? This
’ere’s good tea.”
I was thinking of the fair Desdemona.
“Not too strong,” I said.

"Clinched!"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The south-east gale, tearing madly in upon
the desolate stretch of t lr Ninety-Mile Beach,
drove the stinging rain invo her cheek, and dimly,
through the drift and darkness, she cpuld see the
ghostly ridges of the surf that pounded out a
massive bass to the fiend-like shriekings of the
wind. “ Like the voices of lost souls ! ” she said,
with a shudder, as she ploughed wearily up the
sand-hill towards the light that was her beacon—
whether of hope or despair she knew not yet.
By one of those coincidences so strange as
almost to compel disbelief in their fortuity, the
man and the woman were talking of her as she
crept shivering to the door of the weather-beaten
wooden cottage, half-buried, on its windward
side, in sand.
“ On such a night as this, now?” asked the hus-
band—a large, grey man, bush-bearded, and with
kind, sad eyes under shaggy eyebrows.
“ Yes ; even on such a night as this ! ” the wife
answered, with a resolute constriction of her thin,
pale lips. Her face, too, was thin and pale, and
square, and rigidly well-featured; the face, in
short, of a good woman in the worst sense of the
term.
A fiercer gust than common took up the
unrelenting spirit of her speech ; then, in the
succeeding lull, there fell upon the door a
small, faint knocking, like the tapping of a
sparrow’s beak. The man’s startled eyes, as
he looked round suddenly at his wife, said
plainly enough that he believed her test had
come, and as plainly her eyes answered that
she was ready. But all her tongue said was
“ Open ! ”
The wind dashed in and put the lamp out
before they had more than a glimpse of
a white face backed by the outer black-
ness, but the man, putting forth a
gentle hand in the dark, drew some-
thing softly in and closed the door.
“ Ah ! ” was all the woman said,
as she turned again from the relighted
lamp and saw the kneeling figure
just within the threshold. And she
made no move as her husband lifted
into a chair the draggled and storm-
beaten creature that had been her
daughter. Not his ; he was her second
husband. But it was upon him the wide,
wild eyes turned in an agony of question-
ing, and his were the answering words.
“ Poor soul! —poor soul ! It was the
right thing for you to do. Better late than
never. Better late”—he repeated, holding
the forlorn young head against him as
hi turned towards the watching woman-
“ than never. Say it, Dorcas ! Say it,
you too, for God’s sake! ”
She shook her head—the slow, cold shake
of dogged pertinacity. “ Better ” —her hus-
band’s shaggy brows went up—“never!”—
they fell again into a frown.
“Your own daughter, woman!” he said,
letting his big, rough hand slide gently from
the rain-drenched hair to the worn and
pallid cheek. “ Your daughter—good God ! —
not mine ! ”
An honorable tear travelled slowly down his
rugged nose, poised for a moment, and fell warm
upon the girl’s cold hand. It was but a single
drop, but it thawed in an instant the frozen
fountain of the wanderer’s weeping. She clung
suddenly and desperately to his side. “Yes,
yours ! —yours ! —yours ! ” she repeated between
her rapid sobs. “ Though it seems—I am no
longer —anybody else’s ! ”
“ She is right! ” the woman answered to the
man’s unspoken appeal. “ I have no daughter ! —
whatever you may choose to call her ! ”
The stepfather, with one hand on the girl’s frail
shoulder, shook the other in the air.
“ By God ! Dorcas,” he said, slowly, “if you’re
a Christian, I’m glad I’m the heathen you’re al-
ways callin’ me.”
“ You needn’t blaspheme ! Thou shalt not take
the name ”
“Ay, ay— I know ! But, never mind texts just
now —unless you can find me one to justify eastin’
off your own flesh an’ blood.”
“ And if thy right hand offend thee, cut ”
“ To be sure ; to be sure! I might ha’ known
you’d find Scripter for to back you up in—well, in
a crime—that’s just my opinion of it.”
The woman sniffed contemptuously as she walked
to a chair and sat down. “ The opinion of the
ungodly ! ” she said.
“ So be it,” the man said, with a sudden change
of tone. “ But, at all events, it’s the ungodly’s
house—an’ the girl’s got to stay.”
He threw some wood on the fire, and clumsily
put the kettle down to boil. Then he pointed to
the inner room. “ Go in there, my dear, an’ square
yourself up a bit. How far’ve you come ? ” he
added, looking at the sodden boots, as she got un-
steadily to her feet.
“ From Yallarang,” the girl said, with a scared
glance at the sphinx-like figure on the chair.
I came that far in the train, and then I followed
the beach. ”
“Poor soul !” the man muttered again, with his
head in a cupboard. “ Eleven mile ! In wet sand !
On such a night! ”
The woman watched with
scornful disapproval the blun-
dering incompleteness of
his unaccustomed prepara-

woman of ours all right.”
tions for supper, till at last, when he took down a
frying-pan, she got up suddenly and all but
snatched it out of his hand. Without a word
he stood aside. It was a good sign, he thought.
“She’ll come round all right!” he told himself,
feeling reflectively at his grizzled whisker. “ She
must have a mother’s heart somewhere about her ! ”
But the woman, stooping over the fire, divined
his thoughts.
“You ain’t to think,” she said, without looking
up, “ that I’ve changed my mind ! But it just
made me sick to see you fumblin’ around. As for
Oar—that girl, I mean —you can do as you like !
But I know what /’ll do !”
‘ ‘ Gall her Carrie, Dorcas ! —call her Carrie, as
you were goin’ to. And, as for what you’ll do-
just take thought to yourself what you will do, if
you drive her away again !”
“How can I drive her away? The house, as
you say, is yours !”
“ Ay ! —I can give her a roof. But she won’t
live long under it as a stranger to her own mother!
Come now, Dorcas !—you was a girl once, your-
self ! Just put yourself in her place !” —and the
man laid his hand on his wife’s emblematically
angular shoulder.
She shook it off. “You’re makin’matters no
better by supposin' such a thing ! ” she said angrily.
“ And the roof’s all the likes of her can expect!
If it ain’t enough, she can go !”
He stooped his mouth close to her ear.
‘ ‘ What, woman ? Go ? To the streets of Mel-
bourne, most likely ! Shame on you, Dorcas, I
say ! —shame on you ! ”
If she felt any shame, her face gave no sign of
it. “That’s what she’s come from, as like as
not! ” she answered, as she put the chop-laden pan
on the fire, and the man, with a puzzled kind of
disgust on his face, looked down at her for half-a-
minute before he spoke again.
“ Well —even say ’twas so ! Didn’t Christ for-
five that woman in the Bible? Mary—Mary
lacdougall, or something like that! ”
The woman said nothing of his blunder. She
knew well enough who was meant, and just then
the daughter came timidly back to the room—the
piteous ghost of a fair-haired girl of eighteen or
nineteen. The stepfather gently placed her at the
table and sat down beside her.
It was a silent meal, save for the tumult of the
storm without. The mother kept her eyes on her
plate. The girl stole furtive glances at her. The
man thought it best to say nothing and let things
work. But, presently, noticing the rain had
ceased, it struck him that it would be a good thing
to leave these two alone together for a time. “I
may be only spoilin’ things, after all! ” he thought.
“ Women’s hard things to reckon up ! ”
He got up and filled his pipe. “ Think I’ll have
a look at the weather,” he said, and stepped out
into the darkness.
His tobacco didn’t last long in the furious wind,
but for half an hour he tramped to and fro beside
the thundering surf, puzzling himself over ques-
tions—sexual, sociological, and religious—with
which vastly more sophisticated intelligences have
grappled to no better purpose. Then again the rain
came driving in from seaward, and he went back
to the house.
A sudden fear seized him as he saw that his wife
was alone, and—evil omen in her case —engrossed
with those Old Testament ferocities, which are
the utter negation of the spirit of the New.
“ Where’s Carrie ?” he asked, sharply, and his
wife, without looking up from her Bible, pointed
to the inner room. “ Oh, that?” he said, relieved,
but standing yet with hat on head and the rain
sparkling on his beard. “ Best thing, too —she
was dead-beat. Have you ” —he softened his voice
to a half-whisper—“ have you spoke to her,
Dorcas ? ”
“No!”
“ No ? ” He pulled his penthouse brows together
—then relaxed them. “Time,” he told himself,
“give her time, old man—that’s the only chance.”
“Where are you goin’ to sleep?” the woman
asked, looking suddenly up at him when she found
that he said no more.
He pointed to a sofa that was the most
luxurious article in the room.
“ Very well,” His wife closed her lips and her
book with a snap.
“ I’m goin’ to bed.”
The man, left
alone, betook him-
self to the pipe
o f consideration.
“It’s the best
way,” he told him-
self, as he smoked,
“she’ll be for-
given before mornin’.” Then he locked the door
and put the key in his pocket.
* * * *
Lying by the broken wanderer, the cold,
hard pietist struggled long and fiercely with the
instinct which, even in her, would not be entirely
silenced. But the combination of iron pride with
hide-bound holiness was too strong for it, and at
last the mother slept, without having uttered the
word for which the wretched daughter vainly
waked and waited. And the- gale—growing
fiercer as the night went on—shrieked devilish joy.
For an hour or two the miserable girl lay shud-
dering and listening ; then, suddenly, but with
the quiet deliberation of despair, she arose and
dressed herself, haphazard, in the dark. Then for
a moment she stood irresolute. “No,” she said to
herself, “ I will not kiss her, ” and stepped noise-
lessly into the outside room.
The lamp burned low. The old man on the
sofa slept with one large knotty hand hanging to
the floor. He didn’t stir when the girl lightly
kissed his corrugated forehead.
“Good-bye!” she whispered. “You would
have saved me if you could.”
Then she went to his coat, hanging over a chair-
back, for she knew, of old, where he was wont to
put the key. But the wind, as she let herself softly
out, snatched the door from her hand, and a bang
that shook the rafters shook also both the sleepers
into sudden consciousness. Then, to the man —■
sitting up and staring about him—appeared fran-
tically the white-robed woman.
“She’s gone, William —she’s gone! And, oh,
my God ! I never opened my lips to her. Quick !
—the water ! —the water ! ”
“ Murderess ! ” rose to the man’s lips, but didn’t
pass them. It was the time for action, not for
words, and in a moment he was out amongst the
sand-hills, staring this way and that in the hope-
less gloom. Then he collected himself and ran
down towards the mocking chorus of the sea. It
was mockery in vain, though, for as he rushed he
caught sight of a small darkness upon the faint
glimmer of the sand.
It was she ! Midway between the mother who
had spurned and the waters that waited to wel-
come, she had dropped out of consciousness, and
lay, face downwards, under the drenching rain.
And to the old man, as he picked up the draggled
heap, came an inspiration.
“I’ll clinch this,” he muttered, and, with the
girl on his strong old shoulder, ploughed his
weighted way back to the cottage. But he didn’t
go in. “ There wouldn’t have been time,” he said
to himself, as, upon the seaward side, he laid his
burden upon the heaped-up sand, and stood with
his face set sternly to the drifting rain.
Three or four minutes he waited thus before he
picked up his load again, walked round to the
front, and laid the soaking figure before the
waiting woman—shaken suddenly, at last, out of
the frozen moralist into the frantic mother.
“ Dead ! ” she said, with a quietness more agony-
fraught than any shrieking. “ Drowned ! And I
never opened my lips to her.”
The man watched her keenly from beneath his
bristly brows. He suffered with her suffering,
but again he told himself that he must clinch this
thing.
“ Well,” he said, with as good an imitation of
cynicism as was possible to a nature of coarse gold
—“ you said ‘ better never ! ’ you know. An’ now
it is never, an’ no mistake.”
She stepped out at him with tortured eyes and
clutching hands.
“ Man —man ! ” she said, “ what can you know
of a mother’s heart ? ”
“ More’n she does herself, apparently,” he said
with a sudden jubilance that made the miserable
mother start away as from a whip-stroke. But
then, with the acuteness of accelerated emotion,
she snatched his meaning from his eyes.
“ Not drowned ? ” she gasped, and fell on her
knees beside the girl—already opening the eyes of
hopelessness.
“ Drowned ? No—not much ! Never been in
any water but the rain.” He brought a bottle
from the cupboard. “There, give her some o’
that, hot an’ strong; an’ get her clothes off. I’m
goin’ to leave you together for the present.”
With a smile, he rekindled the universal com-
forter, put his coat on over his wet shirt, and
went outside. The wind yelled at him and the
rain smote him, but he smoked imperturbably on,
saying softly to himself at intervals, “ Clinched I
clinched ! ”

A Christmas Idyll.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scene —Bouverie-street, Carlton, Yic.
Passing down that somewhat squalid street the
day before Christmas, about 3 p.m., I saw half-a-
dozen barefooted, dirty-faced urchins, who were
gravely discussing Christmas and its joys.
“ I don’t know if I’ll get anything from Daddy
Christmas,” said the largest girl; “I didn’t last
year. ”
“ I’ve got sunthin’ already,” said the urchin they
called May, probably after the Duchess of York.
“What is it, May?” _
“ Look ! ” she said, with much glee and pride.
I looked, too, inquisitive as to her Christmas-box.
It was a cat —a dead cat —which had evidently
dried to a mummy on some adjacent land. This
cat the poor little beggar was nursing with as
much pride and enjoyment as if it were a guinea
doll.
“Let’s have a nurse, May, will you? ” pleaded
the biggest girl. »
“Just a little while,” said May.
And this was a Bouverie-street Christmas !

Your whispered words and your arms that cling
Are a link in Love’s remembering.
For your forms are alike as the angels are,
Your faces are moulded as star and star.
I have taken your hand that is soft to take,
I have held it long for an old love’s sake ;
I have played with the curls of your golden head,
As I played with gold curls in a day long dead.
And your rose-red lips I have tasted seem
Like the red-rose lips of a fading dream.
I held her once in my arms of old,
I kissed her twice, but her lips were cold;
I clasped you close to my heart to-night,
A heaving bosom of snowdrift white ;
But there’s never a snow could quench the fire
That burned in your passionate lips’ desire.
With the pleading words ’tis a wrong to name
You are holding your brow for the brand of shame?
There is never a pleasure I could not prove
In the name of the passion you think is Love :
There is never a freedom I might not take
But—l spare you, girl, for an old love’s sake.
I could blacken the fame you hold so cheap
While moonbeams sorrow and red stars weep,
But—l drop your hand though it give you pain,
I dream no dream on your lips again ;
What reck if your heart like mine shall break !
T will spare your soul for her white soul’s sake.
W.H.O.


Collop's Mother .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was an ancient mariner, and of the old
school, a fellow-passenger on s.s. Hauroto, Auck-
land to Sydney. We foregathered, refreshed to-
gether (he didn’t take water in his), and subse-
quently conversed of many things—the way to
set a foretopmast stunsail ship-shape and Bristol
fashion, religion, the superiority of sail to steam,
education, blackbirding (he had been there), and,
lastly, filial affection.
“ I ain’t wot you’d call religious,” he remarked,
“ but I believes in a religious eddieation. I don’t
hold with this yer new-fangled sekkilar system.
I’ve knocked about permiscuous, an’ I says early
religious trainin’ is a first-chop thing. As for
what you calls filliul affeckshun, I don’t take no
stock much in fathers—mine brought me up on
holystone and rope’s-end, dern him !—but no chap’s
any good onless he’s allfired fond of his mother.
You take it from me.”
-1 acquiesced.
“ ever come across Bob Collop—Captain
Collop, that is ? ” he asked with seeming irrele-
vance.
I intimated that I had not the voluptuous plea-
sure of Mr. Collop’s acquaintance.
“ Well, he’s a r-unnin’ down to the Islands just
now, in the Martha and Emily schooner. Years
ago me and him was sailin’ our own schooners on
the Chinee coast, Ningpo to Shanghai. Lots of
Australian chaps was on that lay then. Well,
Collop he was an axample of early pious trainin’ an’
filliul affeckshun, an’ no bloomin’ error. No, there
wasn’t many as could touch Collop ! ”
I hinted that the recountal of the manifold
virtues of Collop might prove a means of grace to
myself. This is the story of Collop—his piety and
filial affection:—
» * * *
My name's Joful—John Joful. Collop
was a saint, if ever was one. But you under-
stand me, he was no God-forgot teetotaller. There
wern’t any—not at sea, at'least—them days. He’d
take his tot reg’lar and his religion didn’t show out
startling, only about onee every four months,
when he said he’d got a letter from his poor old
mother in Sydney. I never seed the letters, but
I knowed when he had one, for he’d go off on a
reg’lar religious rampage, so to speak. We would
be lyin’ in the river and one of his China sailors’d
come aboard my craft with his teeth a-chatterin’
and pigtail a-stickin’ out straight, and say :
“Claptin’, you klum makee see Collop; he
catchee one piecee chopee flom his old muddee ;
he makee too much bobelee, go lah !”
Then I’d know Collop was took bad with piety
and filliul thingummy. I’d take my boat and six
Manilla-men and a few fathom o’ new nine-thread
and pull for Collop’s hooker. Afore we reached
her we’d hear the firing ; we’d pull straight down
ahead, so’s he couldn’t spot us coming, for he’d be
posted on the companion-ladder, half up and half
down, with a loaded old smooth-bore a-restin’ on
the hatch, and with no dunnage on him particular
and his hair a-flyin’ loose in the breeze, and him
six foot four, bare feet, and a fine figger of a man,
and a-patiently waitin’ till something alive showed
so’s he could shoot at it. He misliked heathen
drefful, when these pious fits was on him—bless
you ! he’d shoot a Chinaman, or a Malay, or a
Manilla-man, or a Lascar, or a buck nigger he
suspicioned wasn’t Christianised, whenever he’d
heard from his poor
old mother. That’s
how his what-d’ye-
call -it affeckshun
and early trainin’
come out. But it
showed the nat’ral
religion and good-
ness as was in him
—didn’t it now ?
* * *
I’d fasten my
painter to his an-
chor-chain, tell my
Manilla-men to
stand by, shin up
and sing out loud,
“ All right, Collop,
don’t fire ! it’s only
me, Joful ! ” And
I’d dodge forrud
of the foremast till
I drawed his fire ;
then I’d up stick
and get aft, along-
side of him, afore
he could load.
He was always
glad to see me, and
he’d go on loading,
so’s to be ready for
anything as moved.
I’d say:
“Had a letter,
Collop, old ship ? ”
He’d bust a-cry-
in’ and say:
“Yes, Joful—a
letter from my poor
old mo-mother, as
taught me piety
when I was a in-
nercent nipper at
her knee.”
And he’d catch
sight of some pagan
heathen a hidin’
behind a water-butt
and—bang ! ’d go
his gun, and as he’d run the rod through her he’d
cry gently to hisself and say :
“Missed that yaller thief, Joful. Yes, Joful,
i-i , i , ii 9
it was my poor old mother as taught me all the
goodness as I knows. And I gets a letter from
her to-day, a beautiful letter, full of hiins and
texts and ”
Then he’d slip,
maybe, two bullets in.
“ When I was a
little, little kid a-
dressed in my little
velvet coat and lace,
and my innercent
little drawers with
frills on ’em, she’d
fold my hands and
teach me ”
Bang! would go his
old gun again, and
he’d say, quite sad
and solemn :
“Another inch to
the left, Joful, and
I’d a hit that fat-
headed Chinese low-
dah that don’t know
the difference between
sou’ east and nor’
west —he don’t, as
you’re a sinner, Joful,
which you know you
are, and a drunkard,
which the same is
cursed in the Book ! ”
An’ byemby he’d
let her rip again.
“Oh! Joful, you
ain’t got religion; you
can never know what
it is to me.” And he’d
fill her a quarter up
with powder.
“ Religion’s all I
have left; but I’m at
peace, at peace with
all men. Shove up
that 300-yard sight
forme, Joful! There’s
something in that
lorcha’s riggin’.
’Pears to me it’s one
of them Goa Portu-
guese. Sinful Roman
Catholics they are,
them Goa men ! ”
And after he’d, fired
that shot, and missed
—which he did fre-
quent I’d let a
whoop out o’ me,
and my Manilla-men
’d come swarming
over the bows, and
we’d run round and
round poor Collop
with the nine-thread,
till we’d tangle his
legs and throw him,
and a awful gay time
we’d have, that’s a
fact. We’d bowse him
below and lash him
to his bunk, and take
away all his guns an’
pistols an’ razors an’
carving knives, an’
I’d sit alongside him
and feed him with
big spoons of brandy
or squareface,. and talk to him about his good old
mother or read cliice parts of Scripter—Jonah and
the whale, and Paul’s voyages, and all about the
Ark, and Lot and the promises, an’ in two or
three days these yer religious exercises, and a
little opium as I give him, ’d pull him round.
But it showed —didn’t it? —the effeck of early

the lot of us. The third day he says, sudden:
“Joful, old blowhard, I’d like to see a parson
afore I die ! ”
“ You ain’t as bad as that, Bob Collop ? ” I says.
“ Joful, ”he answers, “fetch me a sky-pilot afore
I die. ”
Well, he was drefful weak and extra pious that
morning, and I felt as if the angel of thingumybob
was abord. I sends a boy down to the mission-
station—’Merican Methodees, they was—to say as
how Captain Collop was a dyin’, an’ to send a
proper certificated sky-pilot—not a mud-hobbler —
and, maybe, some physic. Towards sundown
Collop got worse. Says I to myself: ‘ You’re a
goin’ out with the tide, a-ebbin’ with the ebb, Bob
Collop ; that’s wot’s the matter with you, an’ it’s
spring tides at that.’
.Byemby a sampan sculls alongside, an’ in it a
missionary cove—a little chap with a white ’elmet
size of the bunt of a ship’s mains ’1, and a rumberella
set. Says he, very ’aughty and fierce :
“Is this the Wanderer, my good man ?”
“You bet,” says I.
“ Why isn’t there a proper ladder rigged for
me?” he says like a hadmiral.
Finally we hoisted him on deck, and I pinted to
where the dyin’ man were; but when I wants to
explain—to prepare him for Collop and Collop for
him—he pushes me aside sayin’ we men was all the
same, a lot of drunken brutes. And down he
goes, stiff and grand.
I looked down arter him ; there was Collop, as
I reckoned dyin’, standin’ in the cabin, smilin’
beautiful.
The little chap was very rough with poor Collop,
orderin’ him around like as if he was a Christian
converted Chinkie, and disremembering as Collop
was master mariner, and he was only four foot
odd, and Collop six foot and inches. An’ when
Collop begins talkin’ about his poor old mother the
little Methodee says:
“ I don’t want for to ’ear that rubbidge. Pay me
ten dollars, then I’ll give you some medicine.”
Collop’s face turned kinder queer, but he planks
the dollars, and the missionary he lugs out three
powders in white paper, and says, a-curlin’ his nose:
“ You’ll take one of these now, one at eight, and
one if you can’t sleep.”
Says Collop—soft as a sou’-east trade :
‘ ‘ Which will I take now ? I’ll take ’em for my
poor old mother’s sake.”
“ You stupid, maudlin fellow, never mind your
mother. You take one if you can’t sleep, one at
eight, and one now.”
Collop he smiled a faded smile and asks, poeti-
cal : ‘ ‘ Mate, 'which will I take at eight ? ”
“ This man’s an idiot,” says the missionary.
“ Which will I take if I can’t sleep?” asks
Collop, sweet as East India sugar. “Boss,” he
goes on, “I’d like to own a sky-pilot all to my-
self. What would a gent of your figger take and
sign articles to be my regular chaplain ? ”
“ This fellow’s drunk and a fool,” says the
other, heavin’ his eyes aloft.
An’ I see his ’and (Collop’s ’and) go softly,
slowly behind him, and afore I could move Collop’s
arm comes round dragging a great rug from off
his bunk, and quicker’n you could splice the main-
brace he had dumped the gospel-grinder in the
centre of that blanket—white ’at, rumberella and
a ll and then he catches hold of the four corners,
and ties up the rug with parson inside just as you
ties up dirty clothes for the dhohie to take to wash.
Then he h’ists the bundle on the cabin table, and
as he sees me a-comin’ he just out a revolver as he
’ad ’id somehow and says solemn—
‘ No yer don’t, Joful, onless you’re weary, and
then I will give you rest. Scripter, don’t yer
know.” I saw he meant shoot, and so I waited.
He turns to the bundle of missionary, opens the
mouth of the blanket an inch or so, and says to
what was inside :
“ Chook ! Chook ! Chook ! ” Like as if he’d a
chicken in there. Then he says, “ You’re mv
chaplain ! ”
r l iien he made his chaplain take all them three
powders, and orders :
“ Chaplain, pray for me ! ”
An’ the little chap begins to pray like mad, but
whether for hisself or Collop I couldn’t make out.
After a time Collop peeps into the parcel again an'
orders :
“Pray for my poor old mother, chaplain ! ”
He prayed.
“ Sing a hymn, chaplain ! ”
He sang.
“Preach me a sermon, chaplain. Lots o”ellr
fire in it, please.”
He preached.
But by-an’-by Collop would call him to prayers
less frequent, and, at last, his head falls back an’
he dosses off like a tired hinfant. Down I dives,
chucks the pistol through the port, out knife, an :
cuts the little gent adrift, an’ such a holy mix yon
never did see. I gives him a stiff second-mate’s
R*P four fingers up, believe me—an’ passes the
little creature into his sampan. Next mornin 5
Collop wakes up, fresh as paint. “ A just man
made perfeck am I, Joful, you drunken old sin-
ner —that’s wot he says.
* * * *
But it all showed the goodness of his heart,
an’ the good of early pious trainin’ an’ the infloo-
ence of his mother—didn’t it, now ? Because, you
know, if Collop hadn’t a had them yer things, he’d
’ave killed that missionary—what do you say?
But not he, not Collop. He just made that little
cove pray and preach for him like the Levide ’»
the good Sammarium in the book.
■** * *
But there is one thing as puzzles me worse
nor lograthims ; Collop didn’t really have them
letters from his mother; because he didn’t have
no mother ; because he was a Sydney foundling—
they picked him up, a babby, in a newspaper
where Riley-street is now. Old Captain Slum-
ley’s wife took him and eddicated him with a roll-
ing-pin; an’ Slumley—cussing Slumley, they
called him—didn’t have no religion, nor she,
except rum. Anyway, Collop was true pious,
and full of what-d’ye-call-it affeckshun and all
that, and an axample to the derned young sekkilai
larrikins as is box-hauling and buckin’ and fillin
about Sydney now.
Let’s have a tot, a soldier’s supper and turn in
Sydney.

Wansbury's Second Wife .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Nothing but her; her, her! Oh, yes, I know
you don’t talk of her, but it’s her you’re thinking
of. I was good enough to take up with to look
after her child, but now the kid’s dead, too, I’m tc
be nothing. Nothing, am I? ” Her voice rose tc
a hoarse shriek.
Wansbury sighed. Though only a surfaceman,
he was yet conscious of inherent gentlemanliness :
but this creature would yet drag him to her own
level. She could not forgive his fits of abstrac-
tion ; she had no generosity, no delicacy. A coarse,
bad-tempered woman, that was Wausbury’s second
wife.
“ Struck down by the buffer ! ”
“ Stand back, he’s dying; can’t live ten
minutes. ”
“ Look out, here’s his wife! ”
She came stumbling across the railway-line, hei
draggled skirt blown back from her shapeless
figure, her big red face sodden with crying. There
was something half-hidden in her hand.
The dying man seemed to shrink into himself as
she knelt clumsily beside him.
“ Charley ! ” Her hot breath was on his face.
“ I’ve brought you something—her portrait. I’m
behind you, Charley, where you can’t see me.
Can you see her ? I'm holding it before you ; I’ll
hold it there till—till ”
And the coarse hand did not falter till the
glazing eyes of the dying man closed for ever.

Nikoa.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A white man, thin, brown-skinned, and
ragged, was walking along the reef at Henuake,
one of the Low Archipelago. In his hand he
carried a turtle-spear, and every now and then he
would examine the deep pools that, at intervals,
broke the hollow crust of the reef. Behind him,
carrying a basket, came his native wife.
The tide was very low, and the outer edge of
the black wall of reef, covered on the top with
patches and clumps of round yellow and pink

coral knobs, had dried, and under the fierce sun-
rays a sickening odor arose from the countless
marine-growths and organisms.
Presently the white man sat down upon a weed-
covered boulder on the brink of a pool, and waited
for the woman to come up.
* * * *
The man’s name was Falkiner, and he was
about the poorest beach-comber in the group.
Not many years ago he had been a different man ;
but he had made money fast in those days, and as
fast as he made it he had spent it in drunken
orgies at Auckland, Papiete, and Honolulu. Then
his luck turned, and from being a man of might
and substance and the owner of two pearling-
schooners he had sunk to living on Henuake,
planting cocoanuts for an American firm. Fifteen
months before they had landed him and his wife
and four native laborers, and about twenty thou-
sand seed-cocoanuts. Telling him to be careful of
his provisions, and that the schooner would be
back again in six months, the captain had sailed
away. ,
The woman came up, and, taking the
basket off her shoulders, sat down beside him.
For a while neither spoke. The man was tired
and savage, and the woman knew his mood too
well to speak until she was spoken to. Away on
either hand stretched the black waste of reef ; m
front, the oily, glassy ocean with here and there a
flock’of snow-white sea-birds meandering on the
wing or floating on its smooth surface ; and shore-
wards the long low line of verdure fringed by the
dazzling white beach. . .
“Show me,” said Falkiner, pointing to the
basnet. .
Nikoa opened the basket and showed him a
young turtle of about 201b. weight.
“That will do us, Nikoa, for a day or two.
Perhaps the kau puaka will see now that I want
nothing from them. ”
Now by kau puaka (crew of pigs) the white man
meant his native laborers, with whom he
had quarrelled. When his provisions ran
out—and especially his liquor—and they all
had to live upon native food, his morose
temper soon caused a breach, and it had
gradually widened day by day till at last
the white man and his wife had to seek
their own food.
“ Harry,” said the woman,
“why use such bitter words ? These
men of Raroia are quick-blooded, and
who is to know of it should thy hot
tongue bring death upon us two sud-
denly in the night ? ”
“What do you know, what have
you heard ? ” he asked suspiciously.
“This,” she answered quickly:
“but two days ago two of them came
to me and asked would I go with them
in the boat and seek some other island,
for they are wearied of living here
and getting naught but foul words
from the white man.”
The ragged man looked savagely at
her for a moment, then snarled :
“Well, you sad-faced devil, you can
o-u. I don’t want you any more, curse
The woman’s eyes flashed tire: “ that is the
devil in thee that speaks because it calleth for
more grog. Now, listen. It will be well for thee
to be friendly with these men ; for they are four
to us two ; and they have the boat; and they have
money—much money.”
“ Money,” said Falkiner ; where could they
get money on Henuake ? ” and he laughed incredu-
lously.
Then she told him.
* * » *
Two days before the four natives had been
searching for robber-crabs in a dense puka scrub,
when they had found, lying on the ground, a
boat’s water-breaker. One of them had taken
hold of it to lift it up, and found it to be too
heavy As he placed his hands under each end,
the bottom gave way and a great mass of silver
coin poured out in a heap, ihey each set to work
and made four strong baskets. Into these they
divided the money, and hid it away, i hen they
consulted. , . „ ., « A
“ Let us tell the white man,” said one, and
when he sees all this money he will wait here on
Henuake no longer, but take it and us away with
him to Raroia. ” ,
“ No ” said the others, ‘ let us hide it until the
schooner comes back for us. We can steal it on
board at night-time. Why tell the white man ? He
will keep it and perhaps kill us.”
Put they had told Nikoa, and she had urged
them to let her tell the white man—the money
,vas his, she argued. Were they not his men ? Was
he not a good man to them until all his liquor was
o-one ?—only then had he become sour and moody.
And so they let it rest with her. And now she
told him. . „
u You’re a good girl, Nikoa, said tne
white man, pleasantly. “ We 11 take the boat
and go back to Raroia and let Henuake take care
of itself. Tell the men we will divide the money
evenly—and let us be friends again.”
Nikoa smiled. Loyalty to her husband was
always her first thought, and she thought with
delight of her home at Garumaoa on Raroia —
the village of her childhood, where she was
as happy as the day was long. A year
and a-half ago Falkiner
had bought her from the
chief, and with unques-
tioning obedience she
had followed him to
lonely Henuake. He
was occasionally a great
brute to her, yet, al-
though she was sicken-
ing to return to her
people, she had no
thought of doing so
without the white man.
They rose and walked
back to the line of
palms on the beach —
the woman laughing and
talking joyously and the
man planning black treachery.
In another hour the four brown men had come
baqjc to his house, each carrying his basket-load
of silver dollars. .They were emptied on a mat
and counted out in piles of hundreds. There were
over four thousand dollars. Falkiner divided it
into six shares—one for each of the men, and one
for Nikoa.
Then each brown man tied his share up in a
piece of cloth and handed it to the white man—to
mmd till they got back to Raroia.
“ Whose money was it before? ” they asked him
that night as they sat in his house smoking.
He shook his head. It was mostly in American
dollars and half-dollars and Chilian half-dollars.
He had heard of some human remains being found
in Henuake long years ago, and that a whaleship
had been lost there some time about 1850. Per-
haps the money had come from her—whaleships in
those days often carried as much as five thousand

dollars to buy pearl-shell and tortoise shell.
Then the men went away to their own hut to
sleep, and Nikoa, the woman, slept too.
When he was sure she slumbered soundly,
Falkiner carefully examined and loaded his Colt’s
revolver, and placed it in the chest with the
dollars.
* * * *
At daybreak they pulled out of the quiet
lagoon and headed for Raroia. It was calm, and
the day became hot, yet the four men paddled un-
wearyingly all day, with but short intervals of rest.
At dusk a faint air sprang up, and they hoisted
the sail.
“ Sleep, strong men, sleep,” said the white man,
“ Nikoa and I will steer by turns till it be dawn.”
The four natives lay down. The one who was
pulling the bow-oar was a lad named Te Rangi, a
cousin of Nikoa. As he coiled his body into the
confined space where he lay Nikoa threw him a
mat to keep off the chilly night air. Then she
slept also.
• * * *
Suddenly two shots pealed out over the
ocean, and, as the woman sprang up ter-
rified, a third. There, under the first
flush of the rising sun, she saw
three of her countrymen
lying either dead or
dying, and Fal-
kiner pointing
his pistol at
the mat-cover-
ed figure in
the bows.
She seized
his arm. “Harry,
’tis Te Rangi,
my brother. Let
him live ? ” He
shook her off
with a savage
curse, and fired.
The bullet broke
the arm of the
sleeping lad, who
sat up and gazed
in terror at the
savage face of the
white man.
Again the woman caught
his hand and begged for
the boy’s life. He was but
a lad, she urged ; he was,
too, of her own blood — how
then could he betray ? There was
land not far distant. Let him have
his life now and he could be landed
there.
But Falkiner again thrust her aside,
and, this time, sent a bullet through Te
Rangi’s heart.
The dead men had been thrown overboard
and Falkiner had changed the boat’s course to
W. by N. He would get to Samoa, he thought.
Once there, he need have no fear. He had spared
the woman’s life simply because he knew that she
would never betray him. As soon as she got over
losing Te Rangi she would be all right again and
find her tongue.
A few miles ahead of the boat was a cluster of
low islands, uninhabited all but one. Falkiner
knew them well, and presently he said to the
woman:
“ Nikoa, we will sleep on Napuka to-night, and
in the morning get as many young oocoanuts as
we can for the boat, and perhaps we may find a
turtle on the beach. Then we go to Samoa.”
She nodded her head. The wild hatred of the
man that now filled her heart kept her from
speaking.
* * * *
The current in Napuka Passage was run-
ning out fiercely, and the boat could scarcely
make headway against it, even with the strong
S.E. trade filling her big sail.
“ Let us make fast to the edge of the coral till
the tide turns,” said the white man, and he let the
boat’s head fall off a little, at the same time stand-
ing up to get a better view.
But a sudden whirling eddy brought the boat
up against a great knob of coral, and Falkiner lost
his balance with the shock and fell over the side.
When he rose to the surface he was a hundred
feet away from the boat, which had swung round
head-to the current, but was hard and fast on the
coral knob.
“Push her off, Nikoa,” he called out, “else I
am taken out to sea. ”
Nikoa stood up and laughed. “ Even so, killer
of my brother! The heavy box of money, for which
thou sheddest the blood of four men, keeps the
boat firm on the rock. It is a judgment on thee.”
Above the roaring, hissing and swirling of the
water her voice reached him, and, still struggling
madly to gain the sides of the passage, he was
borne out into the blue depths beyond.
Then Nikoa, shielding her eyes from the sun
with one hand, saw a splash in the water, and
THAT'S WHERE HE GAME IN:
MRS. BLOOMER : “ George! ”
GEORGE : “ Yes, my dear!”
MRS. B. : “When you've finished your
prayers , come round here and swear for
me-I’ve lost that tiresome stud again!”
heard a faint cry of agony, and knew that a shark
had taken the murderer.
* * * *
The boat soon lay high and dry on the
coral knob, and Nikoa, lighting a cigarette, sat
and smoked awhile. Then she took out the
baskets of coin, and cut the mouths open and
poured the blood-stained money into the wildly
sweeping waters. When the last one was emptied,
she lay and slept till the tide turned.
When she awoke the boat was drifting in quietly
to the land, and a canoe full of light-skinned men
with strong, wiry beards and moustaches was
alongside.
“ Who are you ? ” said one.
“Nikoa of Raroia,” she answered. “My man
fell out of the boat and was eaten by a shark.
What men are ye?”
“ We be of Tetopoto,” they replied, pointing to
the farthest island; “had there been men with
you we had killed them. Rut we will not hurt a
woman.”
* * * *
For years afterwards the children of Na-
puka and Tetopoto,would find silver money in the
holes and pools of the reef.

Old Jim.
A PATHETIC TALE OF BUSH VERACITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We was camped away back on the river, above
Menindie, doing a bit of fencin’. Prises was all
right and we was as merry as locusts.
There was seven of us and none in the church-
yard. 1
Sittin’ around the camp-fire one night after the
tucker was stowed and with our pipes going strong,
Old Bill starts to piteh about using of the stock-
whip.
“ I mind,” said Bill, “ going across country with
a big mob o’ cattle from Darling Downs to Mel-
bourne. I weren’t too slow with the whip in them
days, but, Lord bless yer, boys, I weren’t in it
with Old Jim and Stringy Bark. If Jim rounded
up a mob and did a bit of cuttin’-out you’d all say
it couldn’t be equalled, let alone beat. But later
you’d see Stringy turning ’em when they bolted
and then you’d wonder which was best man. It
was all settled one fine day, and never did you see
two such ringers as them two.”
“ We had run the mob down on a arm of land
'tween the ’Bidgee and the Billybong, and yarded
'em. There was plenty of water and plenty of
feed, and we reckoned we’d camp for a few days
aid do a bit of washing.
“The second day we was lying around smokin’
and chaffin’ when Stringy—’e fancied ’imself—
gets a bit flash with his whip, and real pretty it
were to watch him. Presently ’e picks out a big
gum, with nice, smooth bark, and writes his gal’s
name, standing 17 foot away and cuttin’ it beauti-
ful—better’n he could with a pen. Then he swings
the whip free like and cuts ‘ Post Orfice, Bal-
ranald.’
“We all reckoned Old Jim was done bad, but
the game wasn’t over by a lot. Old Jim, who had
been strokin’ his bit o’ leather affectionate-like,
starts and cuts a envelope round the name
and address and puts on two stamps—
N.S.W. twopennies. All of us calculated
that Stringy was clean wiped out, but it
warn't so. He comes up again, flourishes h s
whip, crosses out the stamps, and puts on the post-
mark and date. We goes now and gets sorry for
Jim, but again we was mistook. The old ’un spots
Tom, who had been down for a dip, a-comin’ up,
and he just waits until Tom was at the proper
distance, and then— mind yer, boys, without Tom
knowin ’ anything about it—gives his whip a flip
and takes two sixpences clean out of his trouser.i-
pocket.
“Poor Stringy was done, and the new-chum,
who was makin’ the damper, faints clean away.
“Ah!” sighed Old Bill, with tears of bitter
regret stealing down his weather-beaten cheeks,
“ them was the two cleverest stockmen I ever
seen. There ain’t none like ’em now.”

THAT QUIET HACK


A LOCAL OPTIONIST.
THE REMNANT: “Poor devil! no wonder he spits it out!”


Dirt Cheap!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dirt cheap!
The expression was eternally on the tongue of
the little Baptist clergyman who had haunted the
auction-sales of the city week after week, month
after month, for so many years.
It inevitably followed his return home after
these buying expeditions of his :
“Dirt cheap, my dear ! It was really too great
a bargain to lose.”
A SNAKE-STORY.—THE FIRST OF THE SEASON.
It annoyed the wife far more than if he had
described his purchases as not worth the money.
Her replies were tinged with bitterness, and the
shadow grew in her eyes.
“ Things that we don’t want are dear at any
price," she would tell him.
She was thinking with a sickening despondence
of the things that they really did want, the bare
necessaries of which no man takes heed till they
are taken from him.
For years he had been “looking out at the sales,”
and instead of the necessaries there had come at
various times, to the shabby parsonage door,
packages of butter-knives, dozens of cards, with
six knives on each card, boxes of Afghan jewellery,
breast-pins, studs, brooches, ear-rings, dozens of
towel-horses, cases of ornaments (all made after
one pattern, and that an unbeautiful one), twelve
little bronze kettles, three baths, a load of foolscap
that stood on the floor of the study, and reached
half-way up the wall, many boxes of door-handles,
many dozens of gilt-framed oleographs, and of
photograph frames, with two lay figures, such as
dressmakers use for draping their skirts.
Their house was so crowded with these bargains
that it had all the appearance of a second-hand-
furniture shop. There were two sideboards in the
dining-room. In the narrow hall there were three
hat-stands of various designs, and three hall-chairs.
Superfluous toilet-tables and chests of drawers
stood on the landing upstairs. Put in the laundry
were the two mangles, the three bottomless cots,
spades and hoes for which no garden afforded
work, a bedstead that the house refused to accom-
modate.
But the study was the central receiving-place.
Every drawer in the two chests, every pigeon-hole
in the tremendous secretary, was crammed with a
heterogeneous collection that ranged from a table-
spoon to a whitewash brush.
As time went on, every bedroom in the parson-
age received a spare bed, a spare toilet-table, one
or perhaps two spare wash-stands, and innumer-
able spare towel-horses.
The towel-horses and the butter-knives pre-
dominated over everything.
“One hundred and forty-four butter-knives!
Two dozen cards, with six on each ! ”
The minister’s wife counted them. Her pantry
was so often butterless that the irony of this pur-
chase struck her sharply.
They were d*rt cheap,” he assured her.
“ We can never use them.”
They will come in for the children. They will
be nice presents for them when they marry.”
Twenty-eight each for the five of them ! ”
We can use some of them ourselves.”
I only hope that the children will have more
butter to eat than their mother has had.”
Was it any wonder that she was bitter?
She had remonstrated with him, coaxed him,
argued with him, scolded him, abused him, wept
even—all in vain.
It seemed as if a passion for buying had spread
ineradicable roots through his whole nature, until
at last he found himself pinioned, as a great tree
holds the earth, in a grip of iron, against which
his will was powerless to struggle.
All the happiness of the home wore away. Its
peacefulness was destroyed. The perpetual friction
of the two opposing wishes spread itself over
everything.
The children sided unconsciously with their
father. They could not understand why their
mother should be angry with him when the cart
came to the door with all those nice packages in it.
1 hey assisted gleefully in the excitement of carry-
ing the towel-horses upstairs. The arrival of the
Bargains made their only gala-days.
Their father’s face was always full of kindliness
and good- humor at such times as these ; his voice
was a trifle softer and more genial; his eyes
warmer.
If only their mother would not stand like a sentry
on guard in the doorway, with that grim, kill-joy
expression on her lips ! Their childish hearts were
disturbed a little ; it vexed them to see their mother
look so crossly at the nice things, and they began
unconsciously to wish that she would be out when
the Bargains came.
They grew to understand that when their father
came into the house with that genial smile, and a
specially gentle movement as he opened doors or
walked upstairs, a cart would shortly follow.
They did not fathom the meaning of the hope-
less look on their mother’s lips. It was because of
them, her little ones, who would have to go with-
out so much in days
to come, that she re-
sented this waste of
money that should
have been spent so
differently.
“ The children are
vexed because I don’t
smile and look happy
when his loads arrive, ”
she said to her sister.
Her eyes were grow-
ing hard as well 'as
bitter. To have her
children passing their
quick, cruel judgment
is not an easy burden
for a mother’s heart to
bear. Hers ached
under it. But she
said nothing.
The carts continued
to arrive. The bar-
gains multiplied ex-
ceedingly. As the
years went on the
collection grew more
and more varied, more
and more eccentric,
more and more use-
less.
Not only the ground
space was covered with
the accumulations,
but the walls, too, were monopolised by the
piles that leant against them.
A footfall in the hall had the deadness of echo
that one notices in walking in the furniture-
department of a warehouse.
He was such a good fellow, too, her
husband. The best man in the world. She
knew that.
But there came a time when her endur-
ance had reached its uttermost limit,
and nothing but intense anger against
him filled her heart. She went
to her sister, and said that she
could bear no longer the terrible
strain of wanting money, and
seeing it so ruthlessly wasted
under her own roof.
“ I feel as if I must leave him;
go away and never come back,”
she said.
“Send them away,” said the
sister. “Send the things away
some day when he is out, and
sell them all at auction, and
spend the money that very in-
stant. That is what I would
do.”
It was certainly a brilliant idea.
There was daring in it —but
it was not impracticable. The
more she thought of it, the more
it attracted her.
At last she gave herself up to it,
and fearlessly faced the consequences.
He was called into the country for a few days,
and in that time she arranged everything with
the promptness and care of a general. Carts came
to the house, but this time they brought nothing,
and took much away. One after the other the
rooms were cleared of all their superfluities—the
bottomless cots, the lay figures, the towel-horses,
cards and cards of butter-knives.
They were all gone at last. She walked Tip and
down the hall for the sheer pleasure of hearing her
footfalls. They had been deadened for so long.
“ To-morrow,” she said to the children, “ I shall
have a nice pink cheque, and you shall have boots,
and hats, and a doll each, and new brooches, and
all manner of good things.”
The children’s eyes were full of naive surprise.
It was always father who spent, and mother who
would not spend.
The mother understood that look in their eyes,
and it hurt her. But she was so full of delight at
the happy accomplishment of her plans that she
laughed gaily with them.
But not yet the accomplishment !
She had planned, and carried out her plans. All
her part of the plot had been fulfilled. It was the
gods who interfered. On the afternoon of the
morrow, as she was dressing herself to go to town,
and learn the prices that her goods had brought, a
great van drove up to the front door.
The children were talking to someone in the hall.
She went out into the landing and leaned over
the bannisters and looked down.
It was their father ! He had come home a day
before she expected him. Her heart-beats were a
little swifter, but she laughed to herself, and said
nothing mattered now that the things were out of
the way—and then men came in through the front
door carrying the contents of the van. Back-
wards and forwards they went. And the children
ran out on the doorstep and helped, too.
There were the two bottomless cots, the lay
figures, the towel-horses. And there, in the baby’s
arms, were the butter-knives. It was cooing over
them lovingly.
She made a queer little choking sound, and her
husband looked up and saw that tragic listener.
I really could not resist them, ” he said, coming
up the stairs to her. “The lot came in just as I
was passing the rooms, and I bought them in dirt
cheap ! ”
He had bought them all back again !
LOUISE MACK.
Devil-May- Cave.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Although not a banner nor badge do I bear,
I’m one of the army of Devil-May-Care.
Who leads or who follows we care not a curse,
For we hew our own places for better or worse.
It is idle to ask me what land gave us birth ;
We’re the most cosmopolitan crowd on the
earth.
The white or the brown or the yellow may share
The toil and the spoil of the Devil-May-Care.
Who ’listed us first ? Well, the army began
When the missing-link started in business as man ;
For the first one that rose from four feet on to
two
Was a bold, dashing fellow who loved something
new.
He took all the chances and proudly he strode
As the boss of the lot in his sylvan abode.
He cared not a bone for cave-lion or bear,
This first of the army of Devil-May-Care.
Since then we have battled in many a land,
Each square-foot of earth bears the mark of our
hand.
We’ve trampled on cities and countries and men,
And reddened the rivers again and again.
We’ve harried and slaughtered, we’ve battled and
burnt,
But still from it all little wisdom we’ve learnt;
For something goes wrong in dividing the share
That should fall to the army of Devil-May-Care.
By the “ Law of the Strongest ” all justice is
Might :
For the God of the Law is the God of the Fight.
But the battle has changed in the course of the
years,
And sovereigns are armies and shillings are
spears.
And a row of accounts that a grocer may scrawl
Can ruin the bravest and best of us all.
For the fox now is lord in the lion’s old lair—
Hard luck for the army of Devil-May-Care !
For the might of man’s cunning is more than the
sword,
And the soldier may fight, but the talker is lord.
So, wrestle and struggle and fight as we will,
The dealers in lives have the best of us still.
There are folks who hang on to the Law of the
Text,
Who shiver through this world and into the next:
We laugh at their ways, but the grovellers fare
Better far than the sons of the Devil-May-Care.
With never an aim but the love of the fight,
With seldom a thought of the wrong or the right,
Hell-for-leather we go for the fun of the thing,
And it’s little we reck what our going may bring.
For a shilling we tackle all foes that may come,
That the merchant may travel with shoddy and
rum :
And the roads to new markets the nations prepare
With the bones and the blood of the Devil-May-
Care.
There are some of our troopers who stick up the
mails,
There are others who hunt them to death or the
gaols ;
Each one of our soldiers (as chance may behave)
May be blessed as a hero or cursed as a knave.
One stripped to the pelt may a Maxim defy,
One ’gainst the whole world may a doctrine deny ;
For a need or a whim (as the Fates may declare)
Rush forward the hosts of the Devil-May-Care.
We’re slaves to the fat-bellied men of the town,
For themselves and their purses we lay our lives
down :
In trades and professions, by day and by night,
With pen or with pick or with rifie we fight.
But if there’s a lull in the fighting, alack,
We’re turned on the roads with a swag on our
back !
Full partners with Bluey—and how do we fare ?
The broken-down sons of the Devil-May-Care.
We fight for the good and we fight for the bad,
For the thought that’s divine, or for somebody
fad ;
For the little or great, be they e’er so absurd,
For a color, a tune, or a rag, or a word.
But (instead of thus sillily “ going it blind ”)
If we got all the Army to be of one mind,
Our sleek, stall-fed owners would soon be aware
Of the strength of the army of Devil-May-Care.
The fat son of Prudence drives past in great state.
He lives on the wealth that he cannot create ;
He covers us deeply with dust as he flies —
But it’s nothing at all to the dust in our eyes.
Plod on, plod along—’tis the law of the game,
It is chance that ordains (flesh and blood are the
same),
And the man who rolls by in his carriage and pair
May have marched in the army of Devil-May-
Care.

SHE HAD CEASED TO LIVE.
“Where are you living now, Jane?”
“ Nawhere, mum; I’m married !”


ANOTHER TRIAL
FOR THE BULLETIN
We had just finished supper. Supper 1
dry bread and sugarless tea. Dad was tired out
and was resting at one end of the sofa; Joe was
stretched at the other, without a pillow, and his
legs tangled up among Dad’s. Bill and lom
squatted in the ashes doing their exercise by the
dismal firelight, while Mother tried to put the fat-
lamp into burning order by poking it with a table-
fork.
Dad was silent; he seemed sad, and lay for
some time gazing at the roof. He might have
been watching the blaze of the glorious moon or
counting the stars through the gaps in the shin-
gles, but he wasn’t—there was no such sentiment
in Dad. He was thinking how his long years of
toil, his hopes and worry had been met and
rewarded again and again by disappointment and
adversity—wondering if ever there would be a turn
in his luck, and how he was going to get enough
out of the land that season to pay interest and
keep Mother and us in bread and meat.
At last he spoke, or rather muttered dis-
jointedly, “Plen-ty—to eat —in the safe.” Then
suddenly, in a strange and hollow voice, he
shouted, “ They're dead—all of them! I starved
them / ”
Mother did get a fright. She screamed. Then
Dad jumped up, rubbing his eyes, and asked what
was the matter. Nothing was the matter then.
He had dozed and tuf.-.ed in his sleep, that was
all; he hadn’t starved anyone. Joe didn’t jump
up when Mother screamed —not altogether; he
raised himself and reached for Dad’s pillow, then
lay down and snored serenely till bed-time.
Dad sat gloomily by the fire and meditated.
Mother spoke pleadingly to him and asked him
not to fret. He ran his fingers uneasily through
his hair and spat in the ashes. “ ‘ Don’t fret ’ ?
When there’s not a bit to eat in the place—when
there’s no way of getting anything, and when—
merciful God ! every year sees things worse than
they were Before.”
“It’s only fancy,” Mother went on. “And
you’ve been brooding and brooding till it seems
far worse than it really is.’’
“It’s no fancy, Ellen.” Then, after a pause—
“ Was the thirty acres of wheat that didn’t come
up fancy ? Is it only fancy that we’ve lost nearly
every beast in the paddock ? Was the drought
itself a fancy ? No—no.” And he shook his head
sadly and stared again into the fire.
Dad’s inclination was to leave the selection, but
Mother pleaded for another trial of it—just one
more. She had wonderful faith in the selection,
had Mother. She pleaded until the fire burned
low, then Dad rose and said : “ Well, we’ll try it
once more with corn, and if nothing comes of it ;
why then we must give it up.” Then he took the
spade and raked the fire together and covered it
with ashes—we always covered the fire over before
going to bed so as to keep it alight. Some morn-
ings, though, it would be out, when one of us
would have to go across to Anderson’s and borrow
a fire-stick. Any of us but Joe—he was only sent
once, and on that occasion he waited at Anderson’s
to breakfast, and on his way back successfully
burnt out two grass paddocks belonging to a J.P.
• * * *
So we began to prepare the soil for another
crop of corn, and Dad started over the same old
ground with the same old plough. How I remem-
ber that old, screwed and twisted plough ! The
land was very hard, and the horses out of con-
dition. We wanted a furrow-horse. Smith had
one — a good one. “ But him in the furrow,” he
said to Dad, “and you can’t pull him out of it.”
Dad wished to have such a horse. Smith offered
to exchange for our roan saddle mare—one we
found running in the lane, and advertised as being
in our paddock, and no one claimed it. Dad
exchanged.
He yoked the new horse to the plough, and it
took to the furrow splendidly—but that was all;
it didn’t take to anything else. Dad gripped
the handles—“ Git up!” he said, and tapped
Smith’s horse with the rein. Smith’s horse
pranced and marked time well, but didn’t tighten
the chains. Dad touched him again. Then he
stood on his fore-legs and threw about a hundred-
weight of mud that clung to his heels at Dad s
head. That aggravated Dad, and he seized the
plough-scraper, and, using both hands, calmly
belted him over the ribs for two minutes, by the
sun. He tried him again. The horse threw
himself down in the furrow. Dad took the
scraper again, welted him on the rump, hug it
into his back-bone, prodded him in the side, then
threw it at him disgustedly. Then Dad sat down
awhile and breathed heavily. He rose again
and pulled Smith’s horse by the head. He was
pulling hard when Dave and Joe came up. Joe
had a bow-and-arrow in his hand, and said, “ He’s
a good furrer ’orse, eh, Dad ? Smith said you
couldn’t pull him out of it.”
Shall I ever forget the look on Dad’s face ! He
brandished the scraper and sprang wildly at Joe
and yelled, “ Damn y’, you whelp, what do you
want here?”
Joe left. The horse lay in the furrow. Blood
was dropping from its mouth. Dave pointed it
out, and Dad opened the brute’s jaws and examined
them. No teeth were there. He looked on the
ground round about —none there either. He
looked at the horse’s mouth again, then
hit him viciously with his clenched fist and
said, “The old , he never did have any!”
At length he unharnessed the brute as it lay —
pulled the winkers off, hurled them at its head,
kicked it once —twice —three times—and the
furrow-horse jumped up, trotted away triumph-
antly, and joyously rolled in the dam.
Dad went straightaway to Smith’s place, and
old Smith he was a dirty, mean, despicable
swindler —or something like that. Smith smiled.
Dad put one leg through the slip-rails and pro-
mised Smith, if he’d only come along, to split pal-
ings out of him. But Smith didn’t. The instinct
of self-preservation must have been deep in that
man Smith. Then Dad went home and said he
would shoot the horse there and then, and
went looking for the gun. The horse died in the
paddock of old age, but Dad never ploughed with
him again.
m * ♦ *
Dad now followed the plough early and late.
One day he was giving the horses a spell after
some hours’ work, when Joe came to say that a
policeman was at the house wanting to see him.
Dad thought of the roan mare, and Smith, and
turned very pale. Joe said : “ There’s ‘ Q.P.’ on
his saddle-cloth ; what’s that for, Dad ? ” But he
didn’t answer—he was thinking hard. “ And,”
Joe went on, “ there’s somethin’ sticking out of
his pocket—Dave thinks it ’ll be ’ancuffs.” Dad
shuddered. On the way to the house Joe wished
to speak about the policeman, but Dad seemed to
have lock-jaw. When he found the officer of the
law only wanted to know the number of stock he
owned, he talked freely—he was delighted. He
said “Yes, sir,” and “No, sir,” and “ Jusso, sir,”
to everything the policeman said.
Dad wished to learn some law. He said : “ Now,
tell me this : supposing a horse gets into my pad-
dock —or into your paddock—and I advertise that
horse and nobody claims him, can’t I put my
brand on him ? ” The policeman jerked back his
head and stared at the shingles long enough to
recall all the robberies he had committed, and
said : “Ye can—that’s so—ye can.”
“ I knew it,” answered Dad ; “ but a lawyer in
town told Mulrooney, ov»* there, y’ couldn’t.”
“ Couldn’t ? ” And
the policeman laughed
till he nearly had the
house down, only stop-
ping to ask, while the
tears ran over his well-
fed cheeks, “ Did he
charge him forrit ? ”
and laughed again. He
went away laughing,
and for all I know
the wooden-head may
be laughing yet.
* * *
Everything was
favorable to a good
harvest. The rain fell
just when it was want-
ed, and one could al-
most see the corn
growing. How it en-
couraged Dad, and
whatnew life it seemed
to give him ! In the
cool of the evenings
he would walk along
the headlands and ad-
mire the forming cobs
and listen to the
rustling of the rows of
drooping blades as they
swayed and beat
against each other in
the breeze. Then he
would go home filled
with fresh hopes and
talk of nothing but the
good prospect of that
crop.
• » *
Joe found some-
thing on a chain.
He had never seen any-
thing like it before.
Dad told him it was a
steel - trap and ex-
plained the working of
it. Joe was entranced
—an invaluable posses-
sion ! A treasure, he
felt, that the Lord
must specially have
sent him to catch
things with. He
caught many things
with it willie-wag-
tails, laughing - jack-
asses, fowls, and most-
ly the dog. Joe was a ...
born naturalist, a perfect M‘Gooey in his way,
and a close observer of the habits and customs of
animals and living things. He observed that
whenever Jacob Lipp came to the place he always,
when going home, ran along the fence and touched
the top of every post with his hand. The Lipps
had newly arrived from Germany and their selec-
tion adjoined ours. Jacob was their “ eldest,
MULCAHEY (who has made a bad shot with the hammer) : “ Are yer hurted, Mick?"
MICK: “Is it hurted, Oi am! Can't ye see Oi am spachdess wid pain?"
about 14—a year younger than Joe — ahd a fat,
jabbering, sausage-faced youth he was. He often
came to our place and followed Joe about. Joe
never cared much for the company of anyone
younger than himself, and therefore fiercely re-
sented the indignity. Jacob could only speak
German—Joe only understood pure unadulterated
Australian. Still Jacob insisted on talking and
telling Joe his private affairs.
This day, Mrs. Lipp accompanied Jacob. She
came to have a “ yarn ” with Mother. They didn t
understand each other either —but it didn’t matter
much to them—it never does matter much to
women whether they understand or not—any way
they laughed most of the time and seemed to
enjoy themselves greatly. But outside Jacob
and Joe mixed up in an argument. Jacob shoved
his face close to Joe’s and gesticulated and talked
German at the rate of 200 words a minute. Joe
thought he understood him and said : “ You want
to fight ?” Jacob seemed to have a nightmare m
“ Orri'ght, then,” Joe said, and knocked him
down.
Jacob seemed to understand Australian better
when he got up, for he ran inside, and Joe put his
ear to a crack, but he didn’t hear him tell Mother.
Joe had an idea. He would set the steel-trap on
a wire-post and catch Jacob. He set it. Jhcob
started home. One, two, three posts he hit. Then
he hit the trap. It grabbed him faithfully by
three fingers.
Angels of Love ! did ever a boy of 14 yell like it

Dad and Dave left a dray-load of corn and joined
in the hunt. Between them they got Jacob down
and took him out of the trap. Dad smashed the

But Joe wasn’t about.

The corn shelled out 100 bags—the best
crop we had ever had; but when Dad came to sell
it seemed as though every farmer in every farming
district on earth had had a heavy crop, for the
market was glutted—there was too much com in
Egypt—and he could get no price for it. At last
he was offered 9Jd. per bushel, delivered at the
railway-station. Ninepence ha’penny per bushel,

Dad sold—because he couldn’t afford to await a
better market, and when the letter came contain-

Told by a Dandaloot : —“No, Bill; I
never get fur from the Coffee Palace. If you go
out on the roads there’s coves rushin’ at you from
all directions. I didn’t like it. I went over oppo-
site one day to get my picture took. I says to the
girl ‘ I want to be phot-oed,’ and she says ‘ All
right, sir; twelve-aftd-six. Thank you. Step
into the lift.’ And she smiles so sweet, Bill. I
sees a big box with a boy in it, and, thinkin’ she
wouldn’t put me- wrong, steps in. I hears her say
to her mate ‘ Goin’ to be a rise in sheep ’; and,
look here, Bill, that was the only interestin’
remark I heard all the time I was down there. I’d
a married that girl if I’d stayed. I was jest
bondin’ on her one of my looks of intelligence
when I finds me and the boy flyin’ up through the
ceilin’ like aironites. My word, I was frightened,
and before I knew where I was I was jammed into
a chair, my napper screwed up in a vice, and
there was a feller at the other end of the room
hidin’ hisself. I sings out like blazes, and he
comes out, lets me go, and hands me this. Says
he ‘ It’s a very good picture. ’ But it ain’t like me,
is it, Bill ? ’ Why, the top of it’s wrinkled like a
Mudgee ram, the eyes of it’s starin’ like a ‘ Queens-
lander,’ and the mouth’s like a open portmanter.
It ain’t me, is it, Bill ? I come hofje next day ;
there’s no place like the Bogan.”

INTRODUCTORY.
Of bees and birds, in wondrous words,
Of waves, and winds, and flowers, and trees,
A man shall take his pen, and wake
In human hearts, the joys of these.
And one shall tell that all is well
On earth and sea ; and one shall rail;
And one shall sing of endless spring,
And one shall voice the winter’s wail.
I, too, had eyes for kindly skies,
And ears for singing birds and bees j
I, too, had times of riant rhymes,
But not in joy I made me these.
I.
And so this night of nights is o’er,
This fearful night of strife and pain ;
And I lie here, and far before
The young Day climbs the hills again.
With ripe, red lips, and eager eyes
With liquid lights of love a-swim,
He comes to seek the Night that lies
With heart and soul aflame for him.
She bows to his imperious sway,
She twines her arms around his head ;
Her robes unloosed, her hair astray,
They make the hills their bridal bed.
Such subtle splendor, glory, grace ;
Such streams of light as skyward flow—
But Death and I were face to face,
Aye, cheek-by-jowl, an hour ago.
11.
I have not asked for overmuch
To light and gladden this, my span,
For vulgar wealth, or any such
As marks the goal of moiling man.
I had my crown of thorns to wear,
I have not made the weak my spoil,
I have not sought to shun my share,
To shirk, or shift, my mete of toil;
Nor envied rank that princes give
In lands beyond the sounding seas ;
I had my span of life to live,
And in my heart I dreamt of these :
A little work, a little play,
A little home, my own to call,
A little joy to glad my way,
A little love —and that was all.
And sometimes, when the spirit stirred,
To voice my thoughts with patient pen,
And joy to think that some stray word
Might touch the hearts of distant men..
111.
I slept, the springtide round me stirred
So pure, and sweet, and undefiled ;
And in mine ears methought I heard
The laughter of a little child.
I dreamt of dormant things within,
That swelled to flower in wondrous ways,
I dreamt of worlds to woo and win,
I dreamt of love and golden days.
I woke, and, 10, the sun had fled,
The stars were hid in inky pall,
The winds were in the boughs o’erhead,
And storm and darkness over all.
IV.
It lies so still, this heart of mine,
Within my breast the livelong day ;
It lies so still, it makes no sign,
So cold and calm, it claims no sway.
But when the sky a splendor takes
And sunset turns to night again,
Like some poor widowed thing it wakes
To consciousness and bitter pain.
And so, forlorn and desolate,
It sings the stars its song of woe,
And moans and mourns its buried mate—
The treasured dream of long ago.
V.
Mine eyes, that served my heart so well,,
Are blind with tears for all her woe,
Who drooped, and pined, and sought hsiroelll-
And died, despairing, long ago.
Wine ears arc vexed of strife within,
My soul to dismal dearth is wed,
And all my powers arc strangled in
The sordid strife for daily bread; / ,y.
And all my golden dreams are dead,
And all my days are days of pain,
And all my life, a flame unfed,
That out to darkness dies again.
Till lo ! in my despair I cry,
In this my grievous agony :
If God thou be, O God on high !
What pity bast thou shown to me ? ”
VI.
My thought went out with tireless wing,
I rom north to south, and east to west,
To find, perchance, and homeward bring
Some peace for all my great unrest.
It could not glean through all its scope,
Design or purpose, scheme or plan,
A resting-place for faith and hope,
Or care, supreme, on earth for man.
But everywhere incessant strife,
With death the one supreme decree,
And at the springs of human life,
Impenetrable mystery.
VII.
I deemed myself, of all men born
To be the sport and spoil of fate,
Neglected most, the most forlorn,
The most oppressed and desolate.
And I went forth and cried my woe,
In street, and square, and market-place,
That all who passed might hear, and know
My mete of grief, my dearth of grace.
Ah, pardon me ! I was too lost
In contemplating self, to see
The lives around me tempest-tossed,
The haggard want and misery.
Ah, pardon me ! I did not know
How poor my grief, how mean my lot
Beside the sum of human woe—
It dawned on me, and I forgot.
The cry died out upon my lip,
And so, from poor humanity,
Through suffering companionship,
Redemption came at last to me.
And there was light again, and then
The mists that clouded time unfurled,
And I beheld the streams of men
Progressing slowly through the world.
They came from all the ends of earth,
With hearts that held for days to be,
Through fruitful years, or years of dearth,
The sacred seed of Liberty.
VIII.
In soil or sand, the scattered seed
Resolves itself in ways untold ;
And so the smallest human deed
Hath consequences manifold.
For good or ill, I know the race
Will reap the seed a man has sown.
And no one lives devoid of grace,
And no man’s life is all his own.
I know the act is ill that pits
A man against his kind, and good
The act that closer draws, and knits
The bonds of human brotherhood.
I know that round me all the base
Affects me imperceptibly,
And all the sins of all my race
Like ghostly spectres shadow me.
They haunt my steps, whose pathway lies
Halfway betwixt the night and morn—
A ghastly crew, that mock the cries
Of help from children still unborn.
A link betwixt the quick and dust,
The past and future meet in me,
I tremble at the awful trust,
The grave responsibility.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her face was a mask, usually impene-
trable. The lines of pain were smoothed out by
force of will and the mouth was made to smile,
but the man who loved her could see a shadow
deep down in her eyes. All the world saw the
slighting manner and the cold indifference of her
•.husband —he wore no mask—and some pitied the
wife, who was only a girl, and some said she did
not care. But one man knew that some day the
mask must fall, and he watched and waited.
How the blood surged through him as his mare
climbed the last hill, quickened her paces over the
last mile of scrub, and splashed through the water
which sometimes, after the wet season, rose
perilously close to the homestead ! The bamboos
swayed and rustled and creaked together, and the
water was. dazzling beneath the hot sun. His fists
clenched involuntarily as he recalled some slight
to the woman he loved, and the veins rose on his
forehead as he heard again the insolent, sneering
laugh. Some day, he said to himself, he and that
man would find themselves face to face in the
lonely mallee, and then He laughed.
His face softened, and the angry heat cooled.
The husband was away, and this one afternoon
was his, his alone, and who knew but the world
might end to-night ?
* * * *
She sat and talked to him in the cool, dark
room with her little child leaning against her knee.
The shadow lurked in her eyes, but the mask was
still there. The man had not watched in vain.
“Sing tome,” he pleaded, and presently there
rose the low vibrating notes of a born singer, soft
at first, then louder, fuller and richer, trembling
and throbbing from a passionate heart —and the
mask fell. There was agony in the voice and a
tempestuous cry to be free, free ! It shivered with
despair and almost died. The child had stopped
her play, her little face working with the coming
tears. Suddenly she burst out sobbing :
“Oh, mummy, don’t, don’t, don’t! ”
She ran to the piano and flung herself upon her
mother.
“Hush, little one ! ” said the woman, tenderly.
Her hands were trembling as she touched the soft
hair soothingly.
“ She can’t bear me to sing,” she said apologeti-
cally as the child went back to her play, “ she
thinks I am in pain.”
“In pain, oh, my God!” said the man. He
saw the look of anguish which the music had
brought to her face ; he saw the trembling of her
lijjs. His hour had come, and with a mad exulta-
tion he seized her in his fierce embrace. . . .
“ At dusk when the child is asleep,” lie whis-
pered, as he sprang to his saddle and galloped back
to town.
* * * *
She trembled so that she could scarcely
stand as she drew her cloak about her. It was a
hot, moist night, yet her teeth were chattering.
“ Come quickly,” he whispered. “ I have a
boat to take us across the water, and there the
buggy is waiting. We can catch the mail-train.”
He tried to draw her on to the verandah, but
her face turned back to the little cot, standing dim
and white in the corner. He felt her hesitate.
“She will be quite happy,” he said. “He is
fond of her, and she is so young.” He turned her
face to his own, and drew her to the door.
The child was dreaming. She moaned softly.
In her dream, she heard her mother’s voice rise
once more, as the chords crashed on the piano. Her
nerves were quivering. She started up in her cot.
“ Oh, mummy, don’t, don’t! ” she cried out,
shrill and piercing.
The woman’s hesitation vanished.
“She would live to curse me,” she said. She
loosed the wrap, and it fell at her feet. The man's
eyes followed her as she ran to the little bed and
took the child to rest in her arms.
“ Hush, my darling ! Hush, my little lamb !
Mother’s here.”
For one moment he looked, then he went out on
to the verandah and closed the door.
His hour had gone.

“BLIND TO ALL HER FAULTS."


The Dispersion of Mrs. Black .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I know ( ” <said old Bill, meditatively,
“ that it takes more ’n one to get up a proper dis-
persion, but you will find that old woman Black
were dispersed pretty wide, for all that.
“Yer see, it were this way.
Old Sol Black were a whaler down
at Maketu, and, like all sich, he
got a Maori wife and a lot o’ kids.
Well, his old ’ooman met with a
haecident one day in war-time.
Old Sol used to help the tribe in
battle, and on this hoccasion they
got well licked, and Sol’s wife
got eat Sol thought he would
get a white woman to look after
the kids, and he goes to Auckland
in the Flying Fish and brings
one back.
“ She were a widder wot never
had no kids of her own, which
was just into Sol’s hand. She
were a big, fat heifer, and it took
a tidy plarster to make her a frock,
so she seldom wore one. She
minded the kids all right till they
got spliced or went off on their
own hook.
“ Arter that the old ’ooman used
to go about the pah jabbering and
chiacking with one and another.
She were generally barefooted, just
like a Maori woman. She kep’
pretty straight, ’cept when there
was any rum or square-face about;
then she’d get her whack anyhow.
“ They’d shifted to Rotorua by
this time, and their whar& was on
the lake shore ; but most of the
natives lived on the hill. Old Sol
was away ketching crawfish in the
lake when one on ’em on the hill
got up a five-gallon keg o’ rum.
The old ’ooman smelt it, and was
up there on the tear quick. It
were dark when she tacked for
home, pretty well boozed. There
was a lot of hot-springs and cook-
ing-holes and biling-pools o’ all
sorts just off the track ; but, Lord !
she’d been along that track all
hours.
* * *
“Well, there wasn’t no one
at home, so nobody missed her,
anyhow. The old go-ashore which
was their bell was a-sounding for
morning prayers, for they prays
twice a day, do then natives, quite
public in the church, and when the
first lot got a bit on the track they
saw a blanket which had caught
by a corner on a old ti-tree stump,
right acrost the track, and the
further corner was just on the edge of-the bilingest
of all them biling springs.
“ When they looked in there was a lot of hile
on the top, and as the water heaved and rolled
with the heat of hell a lot of whitish, yallerish,
flaky and ropy-looking stuff was a-rolling round
with the hile and water. There was some o’ them
fresh green ferns on the further edge a-hanging
over, and by-an’-by a bigger bile-up than common
fetched some white rag out from hunder the ferns
all lapped and twisted round summut hard. The
niggers ’ud got to know afore this what was the
matter from the blanket, and when they saw the
white rag they was certint, cos them was all her
togs the night afore.
“ They fished out the rag and found it were
lapped and twisted round the neck and breast of
poor Mrs. Black. The head was biled off and like-
wise the arms and backbone was broke through the
middle, what with the rousting about it got when
the bile was most wiolent, and I alius heard say she
were a tender critter.
“ They didn’t know what to do all to wonst.
They thought if they got her out and put her in a
soap-box she’d run through the jints. A’ larst
one on ’em who’d bin to school said the Rumuns
used to put their dead ’uns into jars arter burning
on ’em to ashes, and stick ’em on the mantel where
they was alius handy to cry over. He thought a
callybash, such as they put birds and pork in when
they was biled down in their own fat, would about
fill the bill, and it would comfort old Sol to have
his wife in a funeral burn, as he called it. He
were a rare schollard for a native, that chap.
“ They agreed to that, and got some old bent
tin and pumpkin shells, and a canoe baler and a
long-handle shovel, and ladled the old girl out.
The bones was mostly low down fooling around in
the heddy where the bottom of the hole ought to
be.
“They kep’the bones separate, and when the
head come out from hunder the ferns it were quite
white and nothin’ on it to speak on. Some of the
red hairs was a-twisted round the other pieces, and
some was in locks of hair by themselves among
the hile. Bein’ as she were a copper-topped ’un, the
hairs weren’t as good to see as black ’uns, but they
was very careful.
“ They got a good large gourd a couple of foot
high, open at the top, and they put all the small
goods in ; but the worst job was skimming off the
hile, for they said they would like her to be all
there. But she weren’t, for I see a good-looking
Maori wench a-fishing out the finger and toe-nails
with a pawa shell, and she wore ’em for a necklace
the next day.
“ The shovel come in wery handy for skim-
ming the hile. The worst was keeping the water
out; and they said if that was scooped up and put
in the hipu, it might be unpleasant for various
reasons to Sol when he went to weep beside the
hurn.
“ At larst they got her fixed and a flat bit of tin
on the openin’/ and they said they’d stand the
jimmy on top of that to give it a proper finish like.
It were a melancholy business, some o’ the women
was a-crying and a-howling all the time. The
bones they tied together wery neat and put ’em in
a case o’ titara bark what had had smoked heels
in. Then they concluded to put it in the store
out of the way of the kids, who might think she
were pork if left in the whare.
“ When Sol came back he was quite pleased
with the pains they’d took, and he had a good
look at her and gave her a nod when he left, but
he didn't go and weep beside the hurn, and the
“K« t d h “gU he w ” n,t “ K “
* * * *
“ Well, she stood on that shelf for years
and nobody took no liberties with her, and the
sight of her bony face kept the kids away, till one
da y a tourist came along who wanted to get the
sku H 0 f a cannybul for a skyantific society, and
one o’ the young men sold Mrs. Black’s skull for
half-a-crown and a long beer.
A FINANCIAL ITEM.
TELLER: “How’ll yer take it?”
CUSTOMER: “In me ’ and !”
“ That was the beginning on it. Yer see, there
was no brand on when the head was gone, same
as all on us, and no telling what was inside thp
hipu. Old So] never went there, and the tomb of
Mrs. Black was neglected by him as ought to have
decked it with flowers as is common.
“ By-an’-by the kids got to shovin’ their fingers
in when they got a chance, but they seemed to
want henthoosiasm, and she didn’t get scattered
much that way ; but there was a old tohunga
priest there as carved things out o’ human bone,
and he came acrost the bark case o’ bones one day
when he was a-skirmishing around for dried heels.
He looted ’em, and made two flutes and some
hornaments they call aurei and a search-warrant
for the hair and a whole biling o’ fish-hooks out of
Mrs. Black’s bones, and, bein’ a noted tohunga,
he sold ’em to all the tribes of both islands.
“Then they was going pigeon-shooting one day
and one of the young fellow's dropped on the hipu
with Mrs. Black in it. Yer see, she looked sum-
mut like mutton-bird hile. Well, they hiled their
guns with her and their bridles and saddles, and
them as ’ad boots hiled them ; and the thick part
of her at the bottom of the hipu they threw into
the lake, and the gold and silver fishes scoffed her,
and that just about spread out poor Mrs. Black.
“Well, she worn’t missed for a long time, till at
larst one of Sol’s daughters come and asked after
her foster-mother, and they went to look and
couldn’t find her. It all came out though when
they come to ask, and them as had took pains to
ladle, her out and bottle her was pretty wild, but Sol
said it didn’t matter as he knowed on, she always
was a terror to wander, but it might be orkard at
the last trump, but then agen he thought the
longer she kep’ away from the Judgment the
better for her, and perhaps it were all for the best
Amen.

At Wanaaring, by the placid Paroo, where in the
early sixties the man who couldn’t swill rum out
of an oil-drum without unhitching his belt, and
chop his corns off with a tomahawk, was looked
upon as outside the pale of progressive society, a
blackfellow and his lubra were lately employed at
one of the pubs. The lady was a model of
sobriety, but her lord having acquired an un-
quenchable thirst for overproof rum, his services
were dispensed with. Mrs. Blackfellow was
known as “ Pigweed Mary,” owing to her pre-
dilection for that succulent vegetable, which grows
to such profusion in the Wanaaring region that

Boko’s dismissal he used to hang round the back
of the pub. every evening and anxiously await the
coming of his missus—which unusual display of
affection on the part of her hitherto fickle consort
became the talk of the town.
It ultimately came out that Pigweed Mary, on
completing her day’s work, would breast the bar
and call for big fella rum. This she would toss off
like a connoisseur, but with stoio fortitude she
held the liquor in her mouth until, with pouting
lips, she fell into the arms of Boko Billy, and,
under cover of a voluptuous embrace, the thirst
and nerve-cravings of the Paroo warrior became
assuaged.
Which was the most satisfactory kiss I ever

Bunter and I joined the bank as juniors about the
same time, and were always good friends. He was
managing at Bungburrah, and I had been acting
as relieving - manager for some time when old
Sloper, the inspector, got influenza and I had to
take an inspecting trip which included Bung-
burrah.
I found Bunter very comfortable, as the branch
is a good one with lots of shooting all about.
Bunter was a good all-round man, but shooting
took first place amongst sports when he was con-
cerned. The apple of his eye and pride of his life
was Ponto, a pointer - dog from imported stock
with a pedigree as long as the price Bunter paid.
And Ponto was real good and worthy of the love
and care Bunter lavished on him.
Bunter was popular, but his great friends were
the Smiths, of Tookabobbity station, about twelve
miles from Bungburrah, so when I had finished
my work late on Friday night he proposed going
out to Smith’s when the bank closed on Saturday
and returning on Sunday, so I could go off by the
coach early on Monday morning. Which we did.
Smith was also a great sportsman, and he had a
pedigree pointer named Ponto ; but Ponto Bunter
was better than Ponto Smith, and when the four
of them came in to dinner —I stayed with Mrs.
Smith while they went shooting—Bunter had the
best bag as usual, and Smith didn’t like it.
We had music in the evening—Mrs. Smith and
Bunter were both musical, so Smith and I played
cribbage and smoked while they sang duets. But
I sat facing the piano, and made up my mind to
give Bunter a friendly caution.
Driving home next day Bunter was chuckling
about Ponto’s victory and Smith’s jealousy of it,
so I said, “ Look here, old man, don’t you make
him jealous of his wife, too. It appears to me she
thinks too much of you.”
Bunter flicked his horses once or twice before
speaking, and then, “ I believe you’re right, old
fellow, but you needn’t be afraid. I’ve too much
respegt for old Smith.”
* • • •
When I got back to Sydney old Sloper
was well enough to come to the office, and I must
have caught the influenza from him —anyhow, I
was away sick for a month, and towards the end
of it I heard Bunter was back at the H.O. in dis-
grace—Mrs. Smith !
First day I was at the office Bunter came up
with, “ Hullo, Mac., hope you’re better?”
“Yes, thanks,” said I, “but what about you?
I thought you had too much respect for old
Smith.”
“ Well, yes, and so I had. But then he kicked
my dog.”

Second Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the earliest days of his wooing the grey-eyed
Max called his love his “ rose of Sharon,” and he
delighted infinitely in her flower-like face—eyes
like baby violets, skin pure as an English dog-rose,
and lips geranium-red.
The first vision he had of her sent his thoughts
whirling down the steep of years to the time when
he was 22, and had found another rose—a rose
that he had named a star when he had perceived
how unattainable it was.
He was 45 now; his hair was iron-grey and
stubbly, his beard grey also.
He had been taking life in earnest, and had put
flower-fancies of woanen behind him to hold jewel
ones instead.
The difference of ideas is recommended as a
helmet of salvation to those bent on scaling the
ladder to fame or gathering up booty of earth.
It is so easy to pick a flower, to hold it close and
draw its sweetness into one’s breath—then to press
it tenderly and lay it away—a heart’s forget-me-
not:
But a jewel !—one may not wear jewels with
shabby garments. It is not fit to go decked with
them in the daylight of a work-a-day world. They
shine at assemblies—the mazy dance is made for
them.
And Max called his love his “ rose of Sharon ”
—perhaps the manner of her arrayment prevented
him ever naming her a lily.
Her mother was popularly al-
luded to as the Angel—this since
angels presumably have to do
with the matches laid at the
doors of Heaven. She had mar-
ried two daughters excellently
and anticipated a particular suc-
cess for this, the third, whom her
jewel fancies had called Pearl.
“ She requires a good setting,”
said the mother, “ and she would
grace a countess’s coronet. ”
Max was the Australian re-
presentative of a large soft-goods
firm, and he drew an income of
something like =61500 a year.
Pearl’s mother mentally prodded
the word “soft-goods.” It was
not pretty. It savored of trade-
in fact, it was trade.
But then, he was the son of a
German count; there was a castle
home somewhere in the region of
the Black Forest that would come
to him if he outlived his still-
thriving preceding generation.
And he had been in the Army.
When Pearl’s smile first came
across his path he was 45, and had
been so long using'his thoughts as
Bputgen uses his rays that life’s
superficialities bewildered him.
After two dances, a garden-
party, and 'an “ at-home,” he -was
convinced he and the years had
made a blunder between them.
He was not 45. If the years said
lie was, they were out in their
calculations. He knew for a fact
that he was only 22. The years
had been running in a ring like
hares, and they had come back
to number 22. They might have
been to 45. That was possible.
Remembering past heart-burnings
and sorrows, loneliness and book
consolations, they must have been
to 45, But they were back again
at 22. *
Even some of his clerks seemed
to recognise the fact. They told
him some absurd jests that only
youth very young could smile at.
But he was young enough to laugh.
They heard him afterwards
chuckling behind the glass parti-
tion that made his room. He had
been seen bounding upstairs two
steps at a time. He scribbled
aimlessly on his blotting - paper;
put away his spectacles for natty
gold eye - glasses. Anyone can
wear eyeglasses if he and his
nose can agree about it.
Also Max stopped playing golf
and chess, and took up dancing
and tennis.
Reissler, one of his clerks on
■£3oo a year, aged rapidly from
the hour when he (Max) began to
grow young. Which was, per-,
haps, the compensation the years*
allowed themselves.
Reissler had fair hair and a poet’s smile, which
is qualified by taking so long to come and being
so far away when it is there. Likewise, he was
22, and also out of joint with the years.
When Max took up tennis Reissler threw it
down. When Max developed the toe light and
fantastic, Reissler felt his lot was to lump through
the furrows of life as a yoked ox.
Pearl herself, in these days, wore a fine color,
fluttering eyelashes, and a love-story in her eyes!
The excitement of hovering on the brink of the
misty unspoken gave her a fresh zest in life.
Max’s tenderness to her exceeded any other
tenderness that had entered into her life. He
desired to serve her and to please her. He was a
relict of chivalry. His eyes every day told her
she was the morning-star of his life.
She was pleased with his flower-fancy of her—it
was fragrant with daintiness.
His love declaration was so fervent that she was
convinced her steadfastness to him would be life-
long.
“ I lofe you !” he said. “I lofe you ! There is
not one of my small thoughts that does not lofe
you ! ”
lie did not rush a caress in upon the heels of
his words as other lovers had essayed to do. In-
stead, he lavished a look on her that was like a
kiss dropped on the hem of her gown.
The novelty of this young-old worship held
thrilling joys to her.
With childish abandonment she slipped her
small hands into his large wide ones, and her
replying—-“ And I love you!” was whispered in
a voice vibrating to a satisfying pitch of love's
ecstasy.
She believed him—which was not to be wondered
at. But she believed also in herself—alas ! which
was to be deplored.
So they went into love together.
“ It has taken me forty-five years,” he told her,
“to find out the meaning of life. Most men are
not taking so long to find it. ”
“ You're the dunce-boy,” she said teasingly. “ I
found it out twenty-three years sooner than you.
And I know it quite as well. ”
The marvellous freshness of love’s atmosphere
stimulated him and sent him into the world a very
youth again. The light in his eyes was of exceed-
ing happiness, for he had turned the key in the
prison-doors that held captured the haggard dreams
of yesterday.
He was free, alive, alert among the flowers of
the Garden of Eden. To enjoy the full measure
of the glory and security of this Garden, one
should walk in wide outer darkness for a space.
“ The only reason the world was made was that
men and women might love each other,” he said,
regarding the Maker’s earliest conception as the
Government or the philanthropic may occasionally
regard bricks and stones—good for asylums and
roadways.
Space held men and women. God saw they
needed bowers for love-making. So He made the
world.
Reissler’s love-declaration was a dirge of despair,
and Pearl’s eyes grew misty over it. He had a
special facility for stringing together love-phrases.
His opinion upon the unchangeableness and in-
tensity of his love ran into oaths pleasing to an
emotional girl.
Max had chiefly said, “ I lofe you ! You are an
angel, Pearl ! I lofe you so ! ”
But the gladsomeness of Max’s second youth did
not make Pearl nearly so glad as Reissler’s pre-
mature age made her restless and sad.
She pulled life into little pieces with Reissler,
whose smile now brought thoughts of a printed
tragedy, the ink of which is still wet.
Sympathy is a tide with its ebb and flow.
Max no longer needed those waves of pity that
had risen towards him for his forlornness, so they
rose on Reissler’s shore and left Max looking into
a heart whose emotion had sunk low.
“You grow cold to me ! ” he reproached her :
“is it that you no longer have any lofe for me ? ”
PANTOMIME PRINCE: “ Sow do you like my new dress, Mr. Legshowe?"
MANGER (after critical examination) : “Delightful! My wordl You’ve got ’em all on!”
“I love you,” she said with her lips alone.
But to stir up wells of gladness in another’s
heart such words want the eyes to be in unison
with the lips.
He saddened visibly.
“ Then you will marry me !” he urged. “ Why
should we wait longer ? ”
She told him she wanted to see life—which made
him feel that some of its dust was falling on her
head.
“ Life was only made that men should marry,”
he said solemnly. “To wait is to tempt death.”
Her mother was equally impatient. She was
distressed. She was annoyed. Finally she was
alarmed.
“ Why should you delay ? ” she said ; “it is full
time you were married. Be married at Easter.
You young people think so much of a moon.”
“ I want to see moonlight in another country.”
“Well, Max will take you round the world if
you ask him.”
But she did not ask him, and Easter slipped
into the grave where the year’s first three months
lay with shut eyes.
“June is the month for a wedding,’’ said Max,
and fell to work making up his books against a
honeymoon.
“ I will leave the books to Reissler ; he thinks
no work can be done without him.”
But Reissler fell sick with a very bad cold and a
shattered heart, and took to his boarding-house
bed.
“You can send the books to me of an evening,”
he said to Max, “while I can use my brains.”
Max laid his wide hands on the young shoulders.
“Well try all we can to shove the world on till
you’re about again,” he said ; “ if we can’t move it
it must stay still. But you are booked here for a
week.”
Reissler lay there for a fortnight, very sick
indeed.
Max gave him some evenings that had been
hall-marked Pearl, and he gave them with a cheer-
fulness that made them valueless in Reissler’s eyes.
I ve just dropped in,” he would say ; or, “I’ve
come to knock away an hour or two ” —and his
overcoat pocket produced alluring delicacies.
He spoke to Pearl about Reissler.
‘He is very ill, my lofe,” he said. “Poor
Reissler! he never did haf quite the back-bone
of a man.”
“ What is the matter with him ? ”
“He is taking a long time to get over some
pleurisy that has had him.”
Perhaps it was the sudden swelling of the tide
of sympathy that made Pearl’s breath come so
hurriedly.
“ He will get better ? ” she asked.
“He will,” Max answered; “but I have news
for him that will take away his pleasure in life.
He is to be reduced nearly ,£lOO a year. ”
“Oh she said, and looked at him with large
e yes of distress. ‘ ‘ Oh, don’t tell him yet —please 1 ”
Max promised her and drew pleasure from her
sorrowing.
“My angel!” he said, “how soft is your
heart! ”
She might have cried with absolute safety, so
enraptured of her pitying tenderness was he. For
a few fleeting minutes he envied Reissler his illness.
But as day followed day, and Reissler’s condi-
tion roused fears among the very few who cared
for him, Pearl grew grave and white. She was
almost a lay figure in the love-scene now.
‘‘He is poorer than ever,” said her mother,
You were sensible before—don’t lose your sense
when he is <£loo a year poorer.”
“ But it makes me care more,” said Pearl dis-
mally.
“ He will probably be an invalid for life,” said
her mother.
“Yes, I know. I know. And I could nurse
him,” said the girl; and she went away to indulge
in dreams which showed her Reissler’s head sink-
ing on her shoulder and she herself administering
mutton-broth.
She could imagine him now uncheered, uncared-
for, alone in the desert of a boarding-house—
without the mutton-broth.
Max assured her that his bodily needs were
supplied.
“ I think he wants his mother ;or perhaps—it is
possible—his heart’s dearest,” he said ; and he
tried to enfold her.
But she slipped away. “ Why ? ” she asked.
He laughed. “We are all alike,” he said. “W<
always want them when we are ill—our hearts’
dearests. Why—what is the matter, my angel ? ”
She told him a small, incoherent story. It wa
about Reissler and his love—a close friend of hers.
He listened carefully, watching her. When she
paused, expecting passionate denunciation, he
brightened.
“ I have it,” he said, and ran his fingers through
his hair. “ They must meet. My angel with the
soft heart, you shall take his lofe to him ! I will
prepare him. Then—we close the door and leave
them together ! ”
“ But—she is engaged to some one else ! ”
“ Oh, true! that I forgot. Um ! that is not
goot. That is not goot! It must be hard for Got
himself to arrange these things. What shall we
do, my angel ? ”
She put out her hands supplicatingly, and her
face whitened.
“You must take me to him,” she said, and her
hand slipped into his in its old way.
A sharp silent minute dropped in between them
and made angular the beautiful roundness of
Max’s youth. The years ran back again to 45,
and his face went grey.
“My Got!” he said, “I had not thought of
this. lam not prepared.”
“ I can cure him,” she whispered. “We cannot
let him die. I love him—l can cure him. And
you will help us—oh, Max, you have such power.
You must not let him be reduced ! Eor mv
sake ! ”
“I am not prepared, Pearl!” he said again.
“ My Got ! I had not thought of this.”
The heaviness of this sorrow he could not shake
off. His second youth had no recuperative power.
He put on his spectacles again and saw To-day
with the eyes of an elderly man, and he strove to
get under way with life again.
“I am too old ! too old !” he said ; “but my
arm is strong enough to kill myself and him. I
hate him ! I cannot do him goot. They may
starve! ”
But they did not. Reissler’s salary went up to
.£(300 a year, and Max’s down to little more.
“ He will not marry now,” Pearl’s mother said
to her—“it went too hard with him. He may
remember you in his will—but the castle will pass
to strangers.”
But for sheer infatuation Pearl had no equal.
“ We can have a cottage—and love,” she said.

LILIAN TURNER
A Miner’s Soliloquy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At night when I come from the gully
To my lonely old camp by the dam,
As the dusk is beginning to sully
The glory of Sol’s oriflamme;
Whilst the battered old billy is boiling
I gingerly seek my abode,
To find the result of my toiling
A weight to the load !
And my pulse goes a beat or two quicker,
And I feel just a little bit mad,
Por I kept from the women and liquor
And saved the few bob that I had.
Just see how your “ Providence ” jockeys
To the death his unfortunate hack !
I must “ bandicoot ” spuds from the cookies—
Or go on the track !
I wouldn’t reply to her letter;
I’d give ’em a pleasant surprise. . .
Down, Rowdy! and camp there, you’d better—
It’s only the smoke in my eyes.
Down, dog ! I ain’t grieving, you duffer,
Dame Fortune shan’t see that we fret;
We’ll show the foul witch we can suffer
And laugh at her yet.
For Fortune’s a surly hound, Rowdy;
Yap at her, she’ll yap back at you ;
And because her old phizog is cloudy
Is no reason why ours should be blue.
Wag your tail at her, lad ; don’t malign her ;
Now we’re going to skip from the scene,
For we’ll roll, the first chirp of the minah,
For Jembaicumbene.
Just a weight! And she bottomed at forty—
A miner will know what it means.
A weight! and the prospects were rorty
After driving her into the teens ;
How I tigered and timbered, and numbered
The days that would keep us apart,
For Hope sang a song that had slumbered
For years in my heart.
Sang the same old sweet lie of the faces
I loved and should soon see again ;
The same old sweet song, with the traces
Of tears in its tender refrain ;
Sang of Home till my idiot vision
Brought Fancy to paint in his school,
And Fate mocked aloud in derision
The dream of a fool.
Hark, Rowdy ! They’re singing up yonder—
Your playmates away on the hill:
Will they miss me, the darlings, I wonder,
Now the creaking old cradle is still ?
Will they miss the gruff miner a-roaming,
Whose surliness never was meant;
Who yearned every night for their coming,
Who sighed when they went ?
. And their laughter—an echo of Heaven—
Comes rip-rippling down on the air;
But I cower, the veriest craven,
As the wind brings the sound to my ear ;
For the laughter, so ringing and pleasant,
Has brought me a theme that I dread,
Has mingled the Past with the Present—
The quick with the dead.
For the rush of a dark Northern river,
Its swirl thro’ the rocks and its roar,
The lap of the tide and the quiver
Of bamboos that girded its shore,
The touch of a hand and the whisper
Of words that are searing mv brain,
The song of a child and—our Mizpah !
I live o’er again.
Merry miners themselves, are the children,
In a claim never boomed on the mart,
And the gold that they raise is bewild’rin’
From the hard granite rock of the Heart;
Tho’ deep as Hell’s gate —they will plumb it;
Tho’ fouler than Lethe its flood,
They will bring, thro’Love’s shaft, to the summit
The pure and the good.
As I sit -in the deepest dejection,
Their voices fall soft as the rain,
And the starved, thirsty soil of affection
Drinks greedily in ev’ry strain,
Till the shadows that haunt me have vanished
To the Past where the shadows belong;
By the magical wand are they banished
Of an innocent’s song.
Old Earth has no music that gladdens
The heart like the glee of a child ;
The tone of the aged but saddens
The soul that the song has beguiled ;
Oh ! the bright, happy carol of Child-life,
So free from old Care and his frown ! >
So joyous and gay in the wild-life,
So choked in the town !
I shall miss them as twilight is glowing,
And I brood by the camp-fire alone,
With the butcher-birds’ melody flowing
As liquid and pure as their own ;
I shall miss the glad radiance darting
From each sweet, sunny face in its glee—
Ah ! they don’t know the pang of the parting
To Rowdy and me !
For I leave the old gully to-morrow,
To gaze on its beauty no more,
But the voices that softened my sorrow -
I’ll hoard with the treasures of yore;
When my last camp is pitched in the valley
That’s shaded by Death’s gloomy wing,
May the voices that sang in the gully
My requiem sing !

“A Case of Affinity.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ . . . They meet somewhere as by Fate, and see
each other, and they instantly know, as by a kind cf
instinct, that they are consorts.” — Swedenborg.
Warooma is a decidedly ugly township—
the usual repugnant combination of weather-
boards and corrugated-iron. In the spring, the
country round clothes itself with a sort of spurious
pleasantness ; the grass, then, is long and green.
But as soon as the sun becomes hot, the greenness
dies away and leaves the land naked and shameful
—dried-up grass, yellow sand, crooked dog-leg
fences, and all as fiat as back-block beer.
There is a creek, which the residents much prize
and call a “river.” It comes from somewhere
where there are hills and rains. On its long
journey, it grows by degrees smaller and slower
until, a few miles beyond Warooma, it spreads
itself out into a shallow frying-pan, where the sun
frizzles it up.
But by the township it is fairly deep, although
narrow, and there are gum-trees along its banks.
It is here that the young men and maidens of
Warooma “ hunt in couples,” and get fixed up for
life. Or a part of it.
Here also is the scene of a romantic tragedy dear
to the hearts of Warooma people. It took place
more than twenty years ago, but it is treasured up
in their memories, and will, no doubt, descend
from parents to children for ever and ever. They
can still point out the old gum-tree, with its long
and suggestive branch reaching over the water to
which the young man hung himself, and also the
identical pool in the creek where the faithless
maiden who jilted him, with true artistic instinct,
afterwards drowned herself.
But I did not learn all these things until after
the adventure which I am going to describe.
m * * +
About an hour after I had alighted from the
coach for the first tune in Warooma, I left the
hotel intending to take a stroll and some fresh air
before going to bed.
I walked down to the end of the main street and
stopped there, uncertain whether to go on a little
way into the country or return.
While I stood there hesitating my eyes fell on
an old hut a few chains along the road, and I ex-
perienced an eerie sensation of familiarity with it.
It was a tumble-down shanty without door or
windows, and surrounded by a few posts—the re
mains of a fence. As I looked at it the feeling
passed off. I had never seen it before.
GOOD BUSINESS.
LITTLE MARY ANN SMITH (to storekeeper-postmaster): “ Please put a stamp on this ’ere letter.
Mother’ll send the eggs to pay for it when the ’eus lays them.”
Alniost unconsciously I walked on until I came
~0 an old wooden bridge that spanned the creek,
As I ; stepped on to it the same feeling of some
long-'ago familiarity with the place came over me.
It was a lovely evening, clear and cool. The
moori was right overhead, and its soft light had
transformed the scene into one of grotesque
beauty.
When I revisited the place by daylight I hardly
recognised it.
I crossed the bridge, and strolled along by the
side of the creek. I had not gone far when I came
to a sadden standstill.
* * * *
Just before me was a large gum-tree with one
long branch extended over the creek, and under
the branch stood a girl. She was perfectly
motionless, gazing intently into the water. She
held a large sun-hat in her hand, and the wind
had ruffled her hair into disorder. The moonlight
fell full upon her. In figure she was small and
slight, and the outline of her face was regular and
beautiful.
Drawn by an irresistible influence, I walked
right up to her.
She turned round and smiled without any ex-
pression of surprise in her pretty face.
“ Good evening, Lucyl” I said mechanically.
“ Good evening, Frank ! ” she replied, wrinkling
her forehead perplexedly ; “ why do you call me
Lucy ? ”
“ I am not Frank ! ” I answered, rather irri-
tably, “ and I don’t know why I called you Lucy.
I have never seen you before.”
“Nor I you!” she said, slowly; “and yet I
seem to have known you long ago. Have you
never been here before ? ”
“ Never.”
“ Well, I have never been away for any time,”
she said.
“ Will you tell me why you came here to-night? ”
I asked.
“ I came to meet you,” she said, dreamily, and
then she shook her head as though confused, and
added “ I don’t mean that. I don’t know why I
carne.” Her eyes looked straight into mine, full
of bewilderment. _
We were standing close together, and our hands
came into contact. I took her hand into mine. It
was very small and soft. She did not seem to
notice. A sudden wave of passion took possession
of me. I slipped my arm round her waist and
drew her against me, and bent my head to kiss
her, but she hid her face in my coat.
“Lucy,” I said awkwardly; “I want to kiss
you ! ”
“No, don’t!”
“ I will—l must,” said I.
She turned her face up to me, smiling resignedly.
“ If you will, you will,” she said.
I kissed her on the forehead. It wasn’t quite
what I had intended, but my face was hot, and I
felt ashamed.
Then she slipped out of my arms and stepped
back. That kiss seemed to have transformed her.
Her whole manner changed in an instant: from
being soft and yielding, she became quick and
alert. Her eyes fairly danced, and her lips curved
mischievously. Then she broke into a peal of
merry laughter. It was the prettiest laugh I have
ever heard, but at the time it was disconcerting.
How you did blush ! ” she cried ; “ and you don’t
know how to kiss at all ! ” Then she turned round
and started to run for it. But she hadn’t a chance.
I held her firmly, and, in spite of her struggles,
kissed her pretty mouth and eyes again and again.
Then she ceased struggling, and her lithe arms
crept round my neck and her lips grew softer and
tinging,
Then we drew apart, both her hands in mine,
nd gazed at each other silently,
She broke the tension. “I must go!”
“ Oh, don't go yet,” I answered,
“I must!”
For a moment I hesitated. She seemed to guess
my thoughts.
“Please, Frank!” she said, looking straight
into my eyes.
A sudden feeling of tenderness came over me.
I kissed her hands and let her draw them
away.
ISLAND EXPERIENCE.
LITTLE GIRL (to visitor, who is relating his adventures in the South Seas) : “ Grandpa’s
been on the islands, too."
VISITOR (looking towards the old gentleman with the Botany Bay limp): “ Where,
my dear?”
LITTLE GIRL: “ Cockatoo! ain’t you, Grandpa?"
“ Good-night! ” she said.
I stood there for some time after she had dis-
appeared, and then I slowly and unwillingly
started homewards, like one who has half awakened
from a pleasant dream.
* * * *
On the following morning I was standing
at the hotel door talking with my friend Jameson,
when who should appear on the scene but my
mysterious sweetheart ! She was approaching us
by the side of an over-dressed young man. I saw
her glance towards me and away again.
As she passed us she looked me straight in the
face for a second and then looked away
again without a sign of recognition.
“Who was that girl?” I
»sked Jameson.
“A daughter of Nelson’s.
Going to marry the man with
her in a few weeks. Pretty,
isn’t she ? ”
“Think so?” I said coolly,
a black anger under my skin —
“she looks rather fast ! ”
“What a fool I was,” I
thought to myself, “to let the
little minx escape ! ”
A lost opportunity is an
awful thing to have on one’s
conscience.
» * *
Jameson and I were
strolling along by the creek
when we came to the gum-
tree under which I had found
“ Lucy.”
“Do you know, Jameson,”
I said, pointing to the long
branch —“I have an absurd
inclination to hang myself to
that!”
He stared at me astonished.
“ What on earth made you
say that ? ”
“I don’t know!” I an-
swered, smiling at his serious-
ness ; “it was just one of those
idiotic ideas that sometimes
cross one’s mind.”
“You haven’t heard the
story of this tree, then? ”
“No ! What story ? ”
“Well,” he said, “about
twenty-five years ago, a young
fellow hung himself to this
tree. He was very much in
love with a girl who jilted
him. She drowned herself a
few days afterwards. I can’t
remember all the yarn, but
heaps of people in Warooma
will tell you about it. It
was strange that the idea of
hanging in connection with
this particular tree should have
occurred to you.”
“ Just a coincidence ! ” I
replied. “Do you remember
the names of the romantic
young people ? ”
“The man was Frank
Towers,” he answered.
“ And the girl was Lucy something,” I sug-
gested.
“Yes, Lucy . . . but how do you know ? You
must have heard the yarn.”
“Perhaps so ! ” I answered ; “ let’s go home and
get lunch.”
* * * *
I wonder how many more lives Lucy and
I will have to toil through before things come
right ? or whether we shall go on meeting
and parting in that identical spot for ever
and ever? Meanwhile, I am going to marry
Alice. Poor Alice ! We have been engaged for
so long that I almost forget I was ever in love
with her.
Such is life.

ARTHUR WATTS.
The Coach of Death.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a phantom-coach runs nightly along the
Western creeks,
Her four black steeds step lightly, her driver never
speaks.
For welcome or for warning she shows no lamp or
light,
A shadow till the morning she steals across the
night ;
She never wants for passengers, the back-creek
settlers say,
A price so moderate as hers the poorest purse can
pay ;
The lost one, missed by measure of days or maybe
weeks,
Pays lightly for the pleasure of coaching down the
creeks,
And station-hands and squatters, alike in ease
reclined,
May praise the whirling trotters whose hoofs out-
strip the wind.
You hear no lead-bars creaking, no footfall on the
ground,
In silence past all speaking the flying wheels go
round ;
The horses have no breeders, their driver has no
name,
But he swings his reefing leaders like a man that
knows the game;
And through the stony ridges where swift hoofs
strike no fire
They want no wayside changes, these steeds that
never tire.
They’re fit to “ stay ” for ever, and are never short
of work ;
They run the Darling River from Menindie Lake
to Bourlce,
Where a thousand watercourses, bank-full or bound
with drought,
Have seen the silent horses go glidingin and out,
Where the stars in red battalions are marshalled
in the sky
To watch the black - maned stallions with the
muffled hoofs go by.
They fear him on the Barwon and curse him on
the Bree,
And wish his goal a far one, where’er that goal
may be;
But ever back and forward, in silence, source to
mouth,
He runs the rivers Nor’ward and runs the rivers
South.
In drifted flood-wrack sailing on every swirling
stream
He hears his patrons hailing, and checks his noise-
less team ;
In belts of timber shady, when all the holes are
dry,
His guests are waiting ready when the phantom
wheels go by,
For every man in good time must book for Further
Out —
It may be in the Flood-time —it may be in the
Drought!
Her load of clay-cold faces she never carries back,
The dim wheels leave no traces, the shoeless hoofs
no track;
But all along the river in the bends that she has
passed
The giant gum-trees shiver in a strange and icy
blast;
The clumps of scented sandal are tainted with her
breath,
And teams are hard to handle behind the Coach
of Death.
She lifts no mud in winter, and stirs no summer
dust,
Her pole-bars never splinter, her lock-bolts never
rust;
Her parts are stout for wearing and strong her
simple gear,
She’ll run without repairing from year to deathful
year ;
When every coach is rotten on the Western water-
shed,
And Cobb and Co. forgotten and all their drivers
dead !

Monk’s Scheme.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Monk was a tall, dark, thin, morose man, who
looked as if he had been built hastily and upon
the run-’em-up principle. There was in his actions
, , ~
an uncomfortable suggestion that he would
assuredly collapse in the next gale. He had high
cheek-bones, meagre, dusty-black whiskers, and a
long, pendulous nose, afflicted with a twitch that
made him a continuous joy to the small boys
1 , . . . . /
going heaven-wards under compulsion via the
little wooden chapel on the corner. Monk had
small, misty eyes that floated in their sockets
without volition. He was a ponderous and melan-
choly man, and spent most of his time out of
doors, backed up against his house, or shuffling
dejectedly up and
down the neglect-
ed garden walks,
“making inven-
tions,” my land-
lady said.
I had come to
live next door to
this man, and as
he was the only
view from my room
window I present-
ly knew him pretty
well by sight, and
used to wonder
what he was living
for. He struck me
as one who might
possibly have done
some good in the
world, but for his
feet, the largest
and most inartistic
extremities I have
ever seen out of
the pages of an
American comic
paper. He was
apparently so con-
scious of the hope-
lessness of any
physical effort on
his part, hampered
and handicapped
as he was with
wide, flat, un-
wieldy feet that
were lark-heeled,
pigeon - toed and
over - r u n with
foreign growths,
that he had fallen
into comparative
inertia, and con-
tinually brooded
over his boots,
looking down upon
them with a hurt,
accusing expres-
sion that was un-
speakably pathe-
tic.
Under these cir-
cumstances, it de-
volved upon Mrs.
Monk to keep the
house going, which
she did by running
a music-school for
infants and begin-
ners. None of the
pupils ever got
beyond the begin-
ner stage, and the
tortured piano
wailed and shriek-
ed continuously from early morning till late at
night, so that house-rent was ruinously cheap
in our street, and no dog could be induced to live
in the neighborhood.
Monk was an inventor; he had invented a patent,
ventilated, damp-proof coffin that had turned out
t F eat suecess f° r another man as a butter-cooler,
I believe, and he was now busy on a new boot
that supplied its own motive-power and would
walk alone.
AT W ?r had been nei ff hbors for some time before
Mr. Monk discovered my existence or allowed me
to divert his attention for a moment from his
depressing feet. Presently, however, he began to
nod occasionally in my direction, and in time I
found him throwing out signals and inviting
friendship and confidence. He sidled in my
direction when I passed of an evening, and came
coughing insinuatingly at the dividing-fence when
I took mine ease under the pepper-tree. I observed
all discreetly with the tail-end of a glance, and
manoeuvred with much strategy, for he did not
promise to be a cheerful or companionable man.
But he invaded my room one evening on the heels
of my landlady, and refused to be driven forth
with conventional phrases. He was big with a
great idea ; he wished to make my fortune and
give me fame and the reverence of men. The
landlady left us, and, having carefully closed the
door, he selected a chair and sat down near me,
nursing his dropsical belltopper, and allowing his
vague, fish-like eyes to float all over and about me;
lin ( d then he asked, with impressive solemnity:
‘Do you want to make a big fortune, young
man ?
He had discovered my weakness. I admitted
that a modest competence would meet my wishes,
and he went on gravely, tapping me on the knee
as he spoke, one tap for each word, by way of
emphasis:
“ I can lay you on to a scheme that’ll make you
rich j n -less’n two years ! ”
He drew off momentarily and studied the effect,
and a spasm wobbled his long nose like an agitated
table-jelly.
“Make both of us rich,” he continued. “ I’d go
alone on’y it’ll p’raps want a active man he
glanced reproachfully at his feet—“ an’ I ain’t
what you’d call a quick-an’-lively sort. You’re
young an’ enterprisin’, and you’re a newspaper
man, I b’lieve, an’ could boom the Metropolitan
Puneral Reform and Mortuary Cold Storage Com-
pany.”
He drew bundles of papers from' his pocket,
and, having carefully provided for his sacred hat,
spread them on his knees.
, “ P’raps you don’t take much interest in
funerals ?” he said. “ I do. I’m an undertaker
P rof «f^>°? ald breedin’ an’-an’-instinct, an’
all my life I ve given a great deal of attention to
this question of funeral reform, an’ at last I’ve hit
it- Mark me, I’ve got here drawn up a scheme
what s goin’ to revolutionise funerals throughout
f,!I S „~°i Un * ry ‘ d be present manner of conductin’
funerals is costly, wasteful, indecent, an’ a blot
upon our civilisation. Eh?”
He evidently expected support, and I admitted
guardedly that there was room for reform, cer-
T , . ,
° m goin to bring about that reform,” he
? al d eagerly, me an you, if you care to stand
ln . In the first place, now, what do you think is
the annual waste of horse-power in Melbourne
alone consequent on the existin’ ridiculous manner
disposin of the dead ? ”
Srt.aX?" “ d
“ Thirty-six thousand seven hundred an’ fifty
HEARD AT THE BAR, AFTER THE “LIVING PICTURES
“What did she wear?”
“Oh, she wore a worried look?”
three horse power is wasted weekly. That’s a
preposteris waste of energy which should be
devoted to wood-cartin’, or haulin’, or chaff-cuttin’.
My scheme will let that power free fer the service
of production an’ trade.
“As an observin’ man,” he continued, after
another dive into his documents, “ you must ’a
remarked the indecent haste with which the
beloved dead is hurried underground in this
country—’specially in summer. Likely enough
you’ve lost a dear one yourself an’ been harrared
up when they tore the departed from your bosom
to bury it in the dismal tomb. Bodies turn very
quick this time o’ the year. My idea ’ll change
all that—mourners ’ll be able to keep deceased by
them for months if they want to —keep him quite
fresh an’ sweet.”
“ When there’s a epidemic about—typhoid, in-
fluenza, scarlet-fever—it often happens three or
four’ll die in one fambily in the course of a month
or so. What’s the consequence ? People are
bothered out o’ their wits with funerals, and
ruined, most like, with the fearful expense
of em an the cost of openin’ up the old grave or
buyin’ new ones. My scheme does away with
superfluous buryin’ an’ extra wear an’ tear. Save
up your dead till the epidemic’s over, an’ then
bury ’em all together in a job lot ! ”
“ How is it done ? Easy enough. Cool storage
that’s the idea ! We build a refrigeratin’ cham-
ber, same as for freezin’ mutton. Advertise
funerals at ten shillin’s a head. People rush us
with orders. We store the bodies iirthe freezin’-
room till we have a good hearse-load, an’ one
cartin does for the lot. It must have struck you
—the ridiculousness of puttin’one solitary coffin
in a big hearse, an ; hirin’ a lot of undertaker’s men,
an’ employin’ two, maybe four, horses to haul it
to the cemetery, when you might save money,
time, an’ wear an’ tear by makin’ one journey of
it ’ _ I used to puzzle over that when I was in
business, but couldn’t get over the difficulty of
storin’ ’em. I’ve hit on the idea at last, an’ there’s
millions in it ! —millions in it! ”
Monk had been pecking nervously at my knee
with his dexter finger all through this explana-
tion ; he finished with an energetic blow, and
backed off, flushed and triumphant, to note the
impression.
“S’pose people want to keep the late lamented
for a while,” he continued, fearing that I was still
unconvinced—" heart-broken widow, an’ all that,
you know, wishes to have the mortal remains of
her loving husband where she can drop in an’
see him any time—we store him on ice under
glass, with paper filagree all round him, everythin’
lovely, an’ charge so much a week for cool storage.
Won’t that catch on an’be pop’lar? Blesh you!
we’ll have the place full of ’em. Money! why
we’ll be rollin’ in it, take my word ! We would
have a branch freezin’ works in each suburb. Most
mourners, ’specially widows, ’ud rejoice to have
deceased near, where they could go an’ weep over
him on Sundays for a few months, an’ put flowers
on his still, cold breast. There ain’t much satis-
faction in a mound of dirt for a sorrowin’ widow,
besides the cost of trammin’ it to the cemetery.
Now, what d’ye think of the prospects of the
Metropolitan Funeral Reform and Mortuary Cold
Storage Company? ”
Monk had risen, and his concluding words were
spoken with the air of a man who had accomplished
a great thing, and who realised the fact.
I temporised. I said the idea was a brilliant
one. I think I succeeded in convincing him that
it dazzled me. It was, I said, an inspiration, the
master-stroke of a great and original mind. It
should not be trusted to the hands of the inexperi-
enced, but should be brought under the notice of
the acutest intellects in the country.
Monk brightened.
“Would you advise me to move the Govern-
ment ?” he asked eagerly.
“ That s the idea—move the Government.”
He arose again, glowing with resolution, but his
cumbersome feet weighed him down, and he sat
once more and sighed reproachfully.
Now, would you undertake to move the
Government, and stand in ? ”
I explained that I was not on good terms with
the Government, that the Government was preju-
diced against me for various reasons, and my
appearance in the matter would be likely to bias
the powers against his epoch-marking idea. So
he left me, dragging his feet after him, resolved to
move the Government in sundry places.
About a week later Monk whispered through
the fence that the Government was visibly moved
but I heard no more of the Metropolitan Funeral
Reform and Mortuary Cool Storage Company
and presently Monk was leaning up against the
sunny side of his house again, gazing dejectedly at
his feet. Edward Dyson.

A Song of Winds.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Woe to the weak when the sky is shrouded,
And the wind of the salt-way sobs as it dies !
Woe to the weak, for a great dejection
Droops their spirits and drowns their eyes;
Woe to the weak who tire of fetters,
Of grim life-fetters that gall and bind !
For the sea tells stories of death made lovely,
And a siren sings in the nor’-east wind.
It wanders the coast like a tombless spectre,
And drips dank dew on the drooping leaf ;
And the soul grows pensive with dim suggestion?
Of grey, old troubles and ancient grief.
Tis grave and low, and with woeful plaining
Sighs death-notes under a sky of grey,
And who hath an ear may hear the voices
Of pale men dead on its streaked sea-way.
In fading twilights o’er sullen seascapes,
A lost, wan wind ’neath a dead, grey sky,
It swoons to land like a weary swimmer,
Sobs and falters and turns to die.
Seeking a tomb in dark, coast caverns,
Where the wet rust reddens the fretted stone,
The wandering sea-thing sinks to silence —
Sinks and dies with a last low moan ;
A last low moan and deadly stillness,
Then the sudden crash of a league-long sea,
And fresh from his den in the white ice region
The wolf of the South is speeding free.
Cleaving the air with his chill, grey shoulders,
And trampling the sea to foam beneath,
The wolf of the South goes howling nor’ard,
A mastless hull in his long, white teeth.
And flying high, a far, faint phalanx
Wings its way to a northern clime,
Sending feathers of sad sound downward,
Singing songs of an evil time :
An evil time, for the black night chases
And darkness swallows the trailing flock ;
An evil season of wild, white weather,
And foam and tumult on reef and rock ;
Of yellow floods on the northern rivers,
And fierce waves swaying from crest to trough ;
Of creaking schooners wearing seaward,
And signals crying—Stand off ! stand off !
Of frothy flakes on the wild waste flying,
And anxious faces and fateful news ;
Of close-reefed topsails and battened hatche:,
And straining engines and racing screws.
Of pumice-stone and brown weeds riven,
Riven and flung on the hissing sand ;
Of the squadroned waves and their mighty charging
And the stern repulse of the frowning land.
Of whipped, white faces faring stormward
With smothered words and wrecked replies ;
Of trees blown down on the windy ridgesg,
And stormy shoutings and tempest cries ;
Of eyes that dance to the wild wind’s music,
Of strange sweet thrills through the calm-sick
form ;
Of Storm, throned king on the mad, white ocean,
Of Storm the Monarch—all hail to Storm !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It could not grieve rue much (not much) to hear
that thou hadst died,
So many seas between us twain had long my love
defied ;
The giant hills my gaolers were ; and all Earth’s
green and blue
The painting of the gilded cage that hid me from
thy view.
Now, Earth’s sad meaning ever lost, unmoved I
pace its shore;
Eor us the hills have sunken down, the seas divide
no more;
And in the watches of the night I tell my love
to thee,
Whom Death but captured from the world to
render back to me.

The Worthington Pumping
Engine Co.
The Worthington organisation is the largest
in the world exclusively engaged in the
manufacture of pumping machinery ; and its
offices and agencies are established in every
important centre throughout the globe. The
eminent engineering firm of Messrs. James
Simpson and Co., Ltd., Grosvenor-road,
London, who are over a century old, and
who always stood as the leading English
manufacturers of pumping machinery
arranged in 1884 with Messrs. H. R.
Compound Worthington Surface Condensing Hydraulic
Pumping Engine.
Worthington, of New York, U.S.A., to take
up the manufacture of the larger sized
Worthington engines. No stronger evidence
than this could be afforded to prove the
efficiency of the Worthington engines. And
no better guarantee could be given than is
sustained in the fact that the Worthington
Pump to-day represents the combined ex-
periences of two such world-famous firms as
Messrs. H. R. Worthington and Messrs.
James Simpson and Co. One flattering
testimony to Worthington value and import-
ance is adduced by those manufacturers, who

put upon the market Duplex pumps, which
are mere attempts to copy the original
Worthington Duplex.
* * * *
For economical pumping and certainty of
reliability, the Worthington pump is being
adopted for lifts as low as 15ft. ; and except
for intermittent or temporary work, putting
down pumps of the centrifugal type, would
not be entertained by engineers who have
had experience with both types. The
Worthington
has the ad-
vantage o f
the centrifu-
gal pump as
regards con-
tinuous flow
in the suction
and delivery,
while its efficiency in lifts of over 30ft. is
about double that of the other type.
• * * *
The large volume plunger chambers and
single suction and delivery chambers render
the Worthington Pumps eminently fitted for
muddy river waters, and no better example
of their success can be
cited than their em-
ployment on a very
large scale to pump the
muddy waters of the
Hoogley at Calcutta.
They .are also largely
utilised at the Water
Works Intake Station,
Mississippi River. All
over the world they are
used for pumping water
into filter-beds or
settling reservoirs.
When the water is
full of sand of a gritty
nature, outside or ex-
ternally packed plungers
are resorted to.

Messrs. James Simp-
son and Co. supplied to the West Mid-
dlesex Water Works Company’s pump-
ing station Hampton, two vertical triple
expansion high duty Worthington Pumping
Engines when the two Bull Cornish engines
were pulled down. Subse-
quently they supplied a third
engine capable of lifting 16
million gallons water per day
to a head of 120 feet, and
working with a boiler pressure
of 120 lbs. per square inch.

The Cornish pumping engines
did many years good work for
the different London water
companies, and it is a sign of
the progression of these scien-
tific days when we see the once-
popular models giving way so
wholly to latter-day achieve-
ments. It is worthy of note
that the substitution of the

The Australasian interests of the Worth-
ington organisation are controlled by Messrs.
Simpson Bros., of 32 Clarence-street, Syd-
ney, N.S.W. They have appointed Messrs.
Mephan Ferguson, of 475 Collins-street, Mel-

sentatives ; McLennan

tives for Tasmania.
These will be pleased to
forward catalogues,

any information desired upon engineering or
machinery subjects.
* ♦ * *
It must be borne in mind that the Worth-
ington organisation stands too high in repu-
tation to dare sell that cheap
pump which, in the long run,
is always the dearest. All they
claim to do is to sell the
world’s best pump at an honest
and reasonable price, and to
guarantee that pump’s relia-
bility and efficiency in every
instance.
Their works
have, up to
date, turned
out over
9 0,0 0 0
pumps ; and
their annual
capacity i s
now 10,000
pumps. A
large and

In the
United
States Messrs. Henry R. Wor-
thington have equipped over
1000 cities with water-works
pumping machinery. The
greater portion of the crude oil
which comes through many
miles of pipes in America is
pumped by Worthington En-
gines, for they work so smoothly
and steadily that engines of
400 h.p., working against a
pressure of 18001 b. per spuare inch, can be
employed without bursting the mains.

At the Chicago Exhibition the Wor-
thington Engines presented the most striking
exhibit of pumping machinery ever seen,
and pumped 70,000,000 gallons every 24
hours. This grand exhibit represented
£40,000. In England, Europe, Asia, and
Africa Messrs. Simpson and Co. have sup-
plied Worthington Engines with magnificent
success.

ployed by the Sydney Metropolitan Board of
Water Supply and Sewage at Crown-street
Pumping Station have a capacity of 12,000,000
and 8,000,000 gallons per day respectively.
The Board certifies that they perform their

The same ingenuity and stability embodied
in the construction of the steam pumping
machinery, and the same business energy
and methods which have enabled the Com-
pany to secure pre-eminence in its line of
manufacture will be continued in the future
as in the past, and with every prospect of
securing results which have heretofore been
as gratifying to the Company as to that
portion of the public with which it has come
into business contact.

When Barney was at last persuaded to
start, the effects of the week’s spree combined
with the heat to make him delirious, and his mates
had a hard job to keep him in the saddle. Sud-
denly they came across an immense black snake
sunning himself in the dust of the road. The
moment Barney saw it his hair fairly stood on end,
and, despite all efforts to hold him, he succeeded
in falling off his horse, and, volleying curses, made
a grab at the snake. The reptile, fully roused,
showed fight, and when Barney in his drunken
fury seized it amidships, fastened on to his arm.
“ Bite me, you crawler ! I’ll chew you alive,”
said Barney as he made a return bite at the snake.
And for every bite the snake gave Barney he got
one in return, till they had nearly chewed one
another up. At last the snake gave in honorably,
being twisted and bitten out of knowledge, and
Barney, now nearly sober, came to his mates look-
ing rather white, and declared that he felt blanky
bad on it. He was hurried back to town and
taken to a doctor, who remarked after examina-
tion : “You can rest satisfied, my man. The
alcoholic poison in your blood when you were
bitten was quite enough to counteract any poison
the snake was able to inject. Indeed, I think you
gave him quite as good a dose as he gave you.”
And Barney, when he tells the story, enquires
where the blank nowadays will you get liquor like
the home-made rum they gave you at Ipswich in
the sixties.
The voices of a hundred thousand travellers
declare that the French steamship service from
Australia to Europe is equal to any steamship ser-
vice in the world. The vessels are of the largest
and swiftest, and the accommodation is specially
designed so as to give the greatest possible con-
venience to patrons. The cuisine—a special feature
—is justly praised. More, as preparatory to u
Continental trip, a voyage by the Armand Behic
or the Australien is a charming preliminary, since
one gains quite a nodding acquaintance with the
indispensable tongue of parley-voo. Yet there
need be, no apprehension of difficulty, for all the
officers speak English, and English stewards and
stewardesses are carried. The time of voyage
from Adelaide to London is 30 days, and a 14-
days stop-over privilege enables Australian won-
derers to sip the charms of France or the delights
of Paris. And so the tourist enters Europe by its
most glittering gates. There is no route to the
Old World so attractive as the route of the Mes-
sageries Maritimes.*

Under the Whip .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When first I felt struts upon Stella,
Quite vainly I strove for her love—
She would laugh if I kissed her umbrella,
Or fondled her four-button glove—
A laugh truly heartless and freezing,
As she said, with a curl of the lip,
Contemptuous, rather than teasing,
“Don’t you wish I was under the whip?”
More caustic the question than teasing—
“ Don’t you wish I was under the whip ? ”
Being wise in her young generation,
She knew no suspicion of doubt
That love is a passing sensation
Which women are better without.
She had studied the game circumspectly,
And a widow once gave her the “ tip ”
That “ boys ” become bullies directly
Their sweethearts get under the whip—
Tyrannical creatures directly
Their sweethearts get under the whip.
But 0, there was rapture in courting
A maid of such singular strength ;
On her text (it is slangily sporting)
She often addressed me at length,
Yet I never once ceased persevering
(The prize was too good to let slip,
Her charms were so fresh and endearing)
Till the filly was under the whip ;
No, I never once ceased persevering
Until she was under the whip.
We had gone to a picnic together;
And another girl threw me a look,
As warm as the midsummer weather,
And clear as the neighboring brook.
My girl in a moment grew fonder,
On my arm she inflicted a nip.
Happy thought! Ruby Ray, flirting yonder,
Would serve very well for a whip :
The sylph making eyes at me yonder
Would serve very well for a whip.
Then, then was my chance of achieving
A mastery over the jade ;
That bosom, reluctantly heaving,
Her one little weakness betrayed.
Without any amorous parley
She drew my left hand to her hip,
And sweetly addressed me as “ Charley.”
Hooroo ! She was under the whip—
She put such expression in “ Charley,”
I knew she was under the whip.
Her manner grew gentle and pleading,
Whilst mine was quite stony and cool ;
She sadly rebuked me for heeding
The tricks of “ that fast little fool,
Who made such a mess of the salad.”
Well, ere we returned from our trip
In the words aforesaid of the ballad,
My angel was under the whip
In the beautiful words of the ballad—
At last she was under the whip.
And now she’s a tractable charmer,
And I am despotic at times ;
In tones that distress and alarm her
I sum up her failings as crimes.
So she settles the matter by crying,
And holding my neck in a grip ;
Which proves, beyond honest denying,
I’ve got her right under the whip—
Stella makes no attempt at denying
She’s glad to be under the whip.

The Dental College and Oral
Hospital of Victoria.
It is only of late years that dentistry has
taken its place as an indispensable branch of
medical science, although the medieval sur-
geon or blood-letter was not only contem-
porary with the dentist or tooth-drawer and
the barber, but, more frequently than not,
united all three functions in his single per-
son. But the tendency of progress is to dis-
count versatility, to encourage specialisation,
and to insist on the excellence in a single art
or science which can only be won by life-long
devotion and study. Hence the dentist, first
as the specialist of a single art, and, secondly,
as the invaluable coadjutor of the medical
scientists of to-day. The human body is so
delicate and complex a machine that its well-
being and harmonious working depend on
the perfect regulation of all its parts ; neglect
a single one of them and disaster is sure to
overtake the whole. And the teeth are an
exceedingly important factor in this wonder-
ful structure, for on them the stomach

depends for the proper preparation of its
fuel, and the whole body is therefore sen-
sible either of their effective or defective
working. This is why
the development of
dentistry as a special
science has won the
co-operation and sup-
port of the medical
faculty throughout the
world. All modern
efforts are directed to
the conservation of
the teeth, and here the
time - worn adage of
‘ ‘ prevention being
better than cure " has
a very special appli-
cation.
* * *
Although Victoria
has taken so foremost
a position as a centre
of liberal education, it
is singular that in Mel-
bourne the special
study of dentistry owes
its birth and progress
to the enthusiasm and
courage of a private
individual, who has
founded a college and
hospital on an ambi-
tious scale entirely at
his own expense, and
has won for it respect
as well as recognition
notwithstanding the
perpetual irritations of
petty local jealousies
and the initial distrust
with which the inno-
vator is invariably re-
garded. (It may here
be noted that in Melbourne the women’s,
children’s, and eye and ear hospitals all owe
their inauguration to individual efforts.)
The Dental College
and Oral Hospital of
Victoria, founded by
Mr. E. Lenthall Old-
field in January, 1895,
has made a wonderful
record in the infancy
of its existence, and
has proved itself a valu-
able addition to the
existing charitable and
educational institu-
tions. Patients who
cannot pay for dental
services are treated
here for dental and
oral complaints, free
of charge, in the same
manner that their
other affections are
treated at the gene-
ral hospitals. Fifty-
seven of the leading
Melbourne physicians—ladies and gentle-
men co-operate with Mr. Oldfield in
this charitable work-in the administra-
tion of anaesthetics, and in performing sub
sidiary oral operations.

fillings ; 2636 teeth in-
serted with a view to
the preservation of
the health ; and 1664
patients attended.
Voluntary contribu-
tions to maintenance
amounted to £l2l ss.
3d. The rest of the
cost has been met
solely by Mr. Oldfield.
* * »
The College has been
fitted up in a very
efficient and attractive
style, and includes
class-rooms, lavatories,
and a fine lecture-
room, nothing, indeed,
being wanting to
render the educational
advantages as modern
and complete as those
of England and America. At present
there are 22 students, 7 ladies, and
5 post - graduates. The curriculum em-
braces lectures and practical training in
chemistry, metallurgy, materia medica
and therapeutics; general elementary ana.
tomy and physiology; pathology and surgery;
dental anatomy and physiology ; dental
pathology and surgery ; operative dentistry
(fillings) and mechanical dentistry. The
students have also the advantage of the hos
pital practice.
* * * *
Mr. Oldfield offers two scholarships every
year, tenable for four years, one available to
the pupils of the State schools of the pro-
vince and one to those of the private schools.
Either male or female candidates under the
age of 17 years may be submitted, the sub-
jects being Latin, geometry, arithmetic,
algebra, English, and either Greek, Fiench,
or German. One of the interesting features
of the College is the inclusion of women stu-
dents, and their conspicuous success in the
new profession which is thus opened up to
them. The best available lecturers and
demonstrators attend the College daily, and
the education of the students is carried on
with an undeviating system and precision.
» * * *
Prior to the foundation of this College
a complete course of instruction in technical
dentistry was not to be had in Australia, and
students had the alternative of either going
to London or America, or depending on the
somewhat primitive or uncertain system of
studying under local practitioners. There
was rarely any public guarantee of the
quality of teaching secured, or of the
amount of capacity
attained ; and fre-
quently men who
desired and would
have done credit to
the most expert tuition
in dentistry, found
that such tuition was
unprocurable without
a long journey or
great waste of valu-
able time. It is
hardly necessary to
dilate on the supreme
advantages of the col-
legiate system, which
achieves with certainty
a definite result in a
given time, and main-
tains the same high
standard of efficiency
throughout.

A New Departure in Life
Assurance .
One of the distinctive features which have
hitherto characterised the difference between
the old-fashioned system of frequent bonus
distributions and the more modern system
of accumulating bonuses for a fixed period
of years has found expression in the varying
extent to which the custom of granting cash
surrender values has been carried.
There is, and probably always will be
considerable divergence of opinion among
experts as to the exact proportion of the
reserve which it is safe and expedient to
refund to outgoing policy-holders, more
especially during the earlier years of a
policy.
The Equitable has for many years been
constantly urged to combine in one policy
the attractive features of the tontine system
and the cash surrender value feature on a
liberal but safe basis; the Society has, there-
fore, at the special request of its General
Agents, and of a great number of its policy-
holders who desire to increase their assur-
ances, decided to issue a policy of this
character embodying the most attractive
features of the tontine principle as introduced
and established by the Equitable years ago
combined with liberal surrender values both
in cash and paid-up assurance, the actual
amounts of which will be GUARANTEED
by the Society.
While the Equitable Society strongly
advocates the continuance of policies in
force, and earnestly recommends policy-
holders not to surrender their policies or
encumber them with loans except in extreme
emergency, it is believed that this liberal
and attractive policy will fully meet the re-
quirements of the times, embodying as it
does the following
GUARANTEES :
The immediate paying of the face of the
policy in the event of death.
Incontestability at the end of the second
year.
Absolute freedom as to residence, travel,
and occupation.
A guaranteed Cash Surrender Value, the
amount of which increases annually, after
the third year.
A guaranteed surrender value in Paid-up
Assurance, increasing annually, after the
third year.
A loan, at 5 per cent, interest, on the third
or any subsequent anniversary of the policy’s
register date.
A cash Bonus at the end of the period of
twenty years or fifteen years.
If the policy is continued beyond the
period, an annually increasing surrender value
is guaranteed, the amount of which will not
be less than the entire reserve on the policy
in cash, or its equivalent in paid-up assur-
ance.
If the policy is continued beyond the
period, it will receive dividends from the
surplus subsequently earned by the Society.
Thirty days’ grace is allowed in the pay-
ment of all premiums.
such is
THE GUARANTEED CASH-VALUE
POLICY
OP THE
EQUITABLE SOCIETY.
THE FOUNDATION STONE OF ALL.
“ £8,442,502 of surplus over all liabilities ”
is the motto on the streamer of the Equit-
able. That means strength, surplus strength,
strength in reserve, and strength is the one
great thing that the policy-holder looks for
in the company which insures him. If he is
a healthy man (and the society insures no
other) he has a contract reaching into the
indefinite future. Death may overtake him,
it is true, within a month or a year, but the
average healthy man who holds an Equit-
able policy may live thirty years or so, and
some of them will live forty or fifty, and the
great question with the holder of a life con-
tract is, “What will the ability of my
company be when this contract becomes a
claim, and what preparation is this company
making to-day to render that contract good
beyond a peradventure ? ” Dividends are
good, options are good ; there are plenty of
good things in good life assurance ; but the
foundation-stone of all is security ; and while
the man or the company who has pound for
pound of valuable assets to meet all liabilities
is solvent, the man who has tens of thousands
of pounds and the company that has millions
of pounds over and above all liabilities are
safer to trust with the contingencies of a re-
mote and unknown future than those who
have honestly, but merely, provided pound
for pound.
The Record of the Past is the Best
Guarantee of the Future.
During the past thirty - six years the
Equitable has accumulated, in the trans-
action of its business, Total Assets of over
£41,800,000,
•out of which it now holds, for the benefit
of its Policy-holders, Total Surplus funds
amounting to over
£8,400,000,
which greatly exceed the sum of the Surplus
Funds which have been accumulated and are
now held by any other Life Assurance Com-
pany in the world.
During the past ten years the Equitable
has made Total Surplus earnings of over
£9,500,000,
which have been larger than those of any
other company, and has, after paying divi-
dends to Policy-holders, increased, during
the same period, the amount of Surplus held
for its Policy-holders by more than
£5,600,000,
which greatly exceeds the increase of Surplus
accumulated by any other Life Assurance
Company in the same time.
ONE PACT
IS WORTH
A Thousand Theories.
All the Twenty-Year Tontine policies of
the general class issued by the Equitable
Society twenty years ago, whose Tontine
Periods expire in 1896, have present cash
surrender values—
GREATER THAN THE
SUM OP THE PREMIUMS PAID.
Note (1) that this return is during the
lifetime of the assured, and (2) that it is
in addition to the protection afforded by the
assurance during the twenty years.
This is true, whether the policies were
issued at the low rate charged in cases where
it is expected in the beginning that pre-
miums will be paid for life, or whether they
were issued at the higher rate, providing for
the payment of premiums for twenty years
only.
The largest returns are shown on policies
issued on the 20-year Endowment form,
which show a return of the total amount
PAID IN PREMIUMS, with INTEREST AT RATES
BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX PER CENT. PER
ANNUM.
These are actual results based on past
experience.
It would be wise for a person intending to
assure his life to study the record of the
Assurance Company proposed to him, and
learn the facts upon which the prospect of
future dividends and profits are based. In
other words, let him ascertain for himself the
results that have been secured by the Com-
pany suggested, in the accumulation of surplus
during its history as well as its average
profits in recent years.
In entering into a contract which may not
terminate for thirty or forty years, it will
well repay the Assurer to give the subject
the careful investigation that would be de-
voted by him to any other affair of like mag-
nitude and importance. Due inquiry having
been made, let the best company in which
to assure be selected—one whose past record
and present financial condition justify the
belief that in the future it will afford both
the greatest security and the largest profit
of any.
The surplus of any life assurance company
is the result of good management in the past,
proof of financial strength in the present, and
indicative of good profits and dividends in
the future. The Equitable has by many
millions of pounds the largest surplus of any
life assurance company in the world, havitig
over eight million pounds sterling of surplus
over all liabilities.
This seems to be a fitting time to call the
attention of policy-holders to the fact that,
as the Equitable Society’s business is con-
ducted on the mutual basis, its interests are
their interests, and that they, being mem-
bers of the Society, share in its prosperity
and profits. Therefore, even if for none but
selfish motives, they should recommend their
own Society to all intending assurers. By
this means they may enhance the profits
accruing to their own policies, and at the
same time extend to others the benefits
enjoyed by themselves as members of this
great Society.
THE BETTER
THE EQUITABLE IS KNOWN
THE MORE IT IS APPRECIATED.
The Tramp.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She laid the stick and her baby on the
grass while she untied the rope that tethered the
calf. The length of the rope separated them.
The cow was near the calf, and both were lying
down. Every day she found a fresh place to
tether it—since tether it she must, for there was
no one to go after it but herself. She had plenty
of time, but then there was baby ; and if the cow
turned on her out on the plains, and she with
baby She was afraid of the cow; she had
been a town girl, only she did not want the cow
to knovv it. She used to run at first when the cow
bellowed its protest against the penning-up of its
calf. This suited the cow, also the calf, but the
woman’s husband was wroth, and called her —the
noun was cur. It was he who forced her to run
and meet the advancing cow, brandishing a stick
and uttering threatening words till the enemy
turned tail and ran. “ That’s the way ! ” the man
said, laughing at her white face. In many things
he was worse than the cow, and she wondered if
the same rule would apply to the man, but she was
not one to provoke skirmishes, even with the cow.
It was early for the calf to go “ to bed ” —nearly
an hour earlier than usual; but she felt so weirdly
lonely. Partly because it was Monday, and her
husband had been home for Saturday night and
Sunday. He had gone off before daylight this
morning ; he was a shearer, and fifteen miles as the
crow flies separated them. She knew of no one
nearer, unless the tramp. Ah ! that was why she
had penned the calf up so early. She feared more
from the look of his eyes, and the gleam of his
teeth,.as he watched her newly-wakened baby beat
its impatient fists upon her covered breasts, than
from the knife that was sheathed in the belt at his
waist.
Her husband, she had told him, was sick. She
always said that when she was alone and a tramp
came—and she had gone in from the kitchen to
the bedroom and asked questions and replied to
them in the best man’s voice she could assume.
But this tramp had walked round and round the
house, and there were cracks in some places, and
after the last time he had asked for tobacco. She
had none to give, and he had grinned, because
there was a broken clay pipe near the wood-heap
where he stood, and if there were a man inside
there ought to have been tobacco. Then he asked
for money, but women in the bush never have
money.
At last he had gone, and she, watching through
the cracks inside, saw him when about a-quarter
of a mile away turn and look back at the house.
Then he went further in the direction that she
would have him go; but he paused again, turned
and looked behind him, and, apparently satisfied,
moved to the left towards the creek. The creek
made a bow round the house, and when he came to
it she lost sight of him. Hours after, watching in-
tently in that direction for signs of smoke, she saw
the man’s dog chasing some sheep that had gone
to the creek for water, and saw it slink back sud-
denly, as if the man had called it.
More than once she thought of taking her
baby and going to her husband, but as yet she had
not set her will against his as with the cow, and
so dared not. Long before nightfall she placed
food in the kitchen, and a big brooch that had
been her mother’s she put upon the table, because,
if the man did come back and robbery were his
object, it was the only thing valuable that she
had. And she left the kitchen door open—wide
open; but this was not wise.
How she fastened the doors inside ! Beside the
bolt in the back one she drove in the steel and the
scissors; against it she piled the stools and the
table. Beside the lock on the front door she
forced the handle of the spade, under the middle
bar, and the blade between the cracks in the floor-
mg boards. Then the prop-stick, cut into lengths,
held the top as the spade held the middle. The
windows were little more than port-holes; she had
nothing to fear through them.
She ate a few mouthfuls of food and drank a
cup of cold milk, for she lighted no fire, and when
night came no candle, but crept with her baby to
bed. J
• * * •
What woke her? The wonder was that
she had slept: she had not meant to, but she was
young, very young. Perhaps the shrinking of the
galvanised roof—yet hardly, that was too usual.
Something had set her heart beating wildly, and
the very air she breathed seemed fraught with
terrible danger, but she lay quite still—only she
put her other arm over her baby. Then she had
both round it, and she prayed: “ Little baby-
little baby—don t wake ! ” 3
She saw one of the open cracks, quite close to
where she lay, darken with a shadow—for the
moon s rays shone on that side. Then a protest-
growl reached her; and she could fancy she
heard the man turn hastily : she plainly heard the
thud of something striking the dog’s ribs, and the
l°ngj flying strides of the animal as it howled and
ran. Still watching, she saw the shadow darken
every crack along the wall: she knew by the
sounds that the man was trying every position
that might help him to see in ; but how much he
saw she could not tell. She thought of doing
many things that might deceive him into the idea
that she was not alone, but the sound of her voice
would wake baby, and, as though that were the
only danger that threatened her, she dreaded it.
If baby cried she felt as if she, in turn, must be-
tray her weakness, and instinctively cry to her
protector fifteen miles away. So she prayed
J-jittiG baby, don t wake ! don*t cry !
, Veiy sfceaithiiy the man crept about. She knew
he had his boots off, because of the vibration that
his feet caused as he walked along the verandah,
and gauged the width of the little window
in her room and the resistance of the front
door. Then he went to the other end, and
the uncertainty of what he might be doing
was fearful: she had felt safer, far safer, while
he was close, and she could watch and listen.
But now. Oh God ! it was terrible. She
felt she must watch, and again the great fear
of wakening baby assailed her. And there was
another thmg : on that side of the house one
wid/h 3 Si, h A d Shr f U n k 111 len S th as well as in
width, and had once fallen out. It was only held

What if he should discover that! The uncertainty
increased her terror. She felt she must rise • and
now, how she prayed as she gently raised herself
Sr breast! “ armS ’ keld to
P ar \ S in , her , child ’ s body she tried to
shield with her hands and arms as she thought of
the knife : even its little feet she covered with its
white gown, and baby never murmured—it liked
to be held so. Noiselessly she crossed to the other
side, and stood where she could see and hear, but
not be seen. He was trying every slab, and was
very near to that with the wedge under it. Then
even while hoping, she saw him find it; and heard
the sound of the knife as bit by bit he began to
cut away the wooden barrier.
She waited still, with her baby pressed tightly
to her; though she knew that in another few
minutes this man with the cruel eyes, lascivious

skb o faH 10U^.tT y - *? rh *l» he expected the
slab to tall. Still, his moti ve puzzled her : his re-
treat was a pretence, she felt sure ; and she moved
even closer and bent her body the better to listen.
Ah ! what sound was that ? “ Listen ! Listen ! ”
ber heart-her heart that had kept so
il lt i n i 0 "' bounded with tumultuous
b fK h du j Ied ber , Nearer and nearer
came the sounds, till the welcome thud of horse’s
hoots rang out clearly.
. “ ,9 h > God ! 0h > «od ! Oh, Ood ! ” she cried;
for they were very close before she could make
sure, and then there was the door so locked and
barred with many bars. The age it took to tear
away its fastenings !
Out she darted at last, and, tearing madly along,
saw the horseman far beyond her in the distance!
bhe called to him in Christ’s name, in her babe’s
name still flying like the wind with the speed
that deadly peril sends; but the distance grew
greater and greater between them, and when she
reached the creek her prayers turned to wild
shrieks, for there crouched the man she
feared, with outstretched hands that had caught
her ere she saw him. She knew he was offer-
mg terms if she ceased to struggle and cry for
help though louder and louder did she cry
for it; but it was only when the mail’s hand
gripped her throat that the cry of “Murder'”
came from her lips ; and when' she fell the startled
curlews took up the awful sound, and flew over
the horsemans head shrieking “M-u-r-d-e-r'
M-u-r-d-e-r! M-u-r-d-e-r ! ”

,,. , God •' ” said the boundary-rider,
it s been a dingo right enough. Eight Jailed up
here, and there s more down in the creek—a ewe
and lamb, 111 bet; and the lamb’s alive.” And he
shut out the sky with his hand and watched the
crows that were circling round and round, nearing
the earth one moment and the next shooting sky-
ward. By that he knew the lamb must be alive.
-ttiTOn a dingo will spare a lamb sometimes;
Yes, the lamb was alive, and after the manner
of lambs of its age did not know its mother when
the light came. It had sucked the still-warm
breasts and laid its little head on her bosom and
slept till the morn came ; then, when the wee one
looked at the swollen, disfigured face with the
starting eyes, and clenched teeth that had bitten
through the tongue and stained the bodice crim-
} ve ,Pk and would have crept away but for
the hand that still clutched its little gown.. Sleep
was nodding its golden head and swaying its small

other s wide-open eyes, when the boundary-rider
galloped down. He reeled in his saddle when he

And he told afterwards how the little
child held out its arms to him, and how he was
forced to cut the portion of its gown that the dead
hand held.

A few miles further down the creek a man
kept throwing an old cap into the water. The
dog would bring it out and lay it on the opposite
side from where the man stood, but would not
allow the man to catch him, though it was only to
wash the blood of the sheep from his mouth and
throat, for the sight of blood made the man
tremble.
But the dog also was guilty.

Chivalry Upside Down.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“E ve n the creed of the outlawed push is cnivalrv
upside down.”—Lawson.
Goetii Wale °* paradoxical sayings.”
Sing hey for the Push and the Pride of the Push,
for Billy the Crimson Pal;
He jabs a ‘ * trap ” in the dexter eye, he ‘ ‘ stoushes ”
his own best gal;
He lands a rock on a “bleedin’ Chow ” and cries
as he cracks his crown—
“ How’s that, Ho-ki, for the Crimson Pal and
Chivalry upside down ! ”
Sing hey for Sikes of the bull-dog jaw, sing hey
for his bludgeon fell,
For his Nancy done to a direful death in the slime
of a London hell;
Sing hey for the folks whose throats he cut, the
dogs he left to drown,
And the motto quaint of that burglar-saint—
Humanity upside down !
Sing hey for the doctored balance-sheet and the
jovial banking crew,
Hurrah for the gay defaulting band and the banner
of I 0 U;
A cheer for the fellows whose bills you back, the
gallants who do you brown
As they troll a lay in a lightsome way of—
Honesty upside down.
Sing hey for the Sweaters who scrimp the girls in
a stifling city den ;
Here’s luck to the Bagnio’s gentle light and the
joys of the Boozing Ken ;
Sing hey for the rake of sixty years and the wench
who tramps the town—
They all mean well in their simple way—Morality
upside down !
Sing hey for Boniface, Beer, and Bung—success to
the Band of Booze ;
A health to the genial Toper Tom and the shakes
that haunt his shoes :
With a red, red rose on his festive nose he’s gay
as a painted clown,
And his creed he’ll sing till the rafters ring—
“ Sobriety upside down ! ”
Sing hey once more for the garrulous gang who
live by a jabb’ring jaw—
The Quacks of Body, the Quacks of Soul, and the
leech-like brood of Law ;
For a lie is a simple, guileless thing if it lurk in a
learned gown,
And may only be (like a paradox free) —a verity
upside down.

THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
Tl)g Stapford Vipcyard
Is the Largest in the World, and forms part of an Estate of. 56,000
acres one of the endowments by Senator Stanford to the University
which bears his name. 3800 acres of vines are in full bearing.
THE FRENCH EXPERTS
AT THE CHICAGO
WORLD’S FAIR
have put on Official Record that
‘ ‘ the Brandy is perfect ; it is
richer than any brandy made in
France.”
Only perfectly Sound Wine from the Choicest of
Grapes is converted into Brandy.

The University Brandy is specially recommended
for Medicinal Purposes .
Mr- 0- E. BLACKETT, FQS-,
VICTORIAN GOVERN-
MENT ANALYST,
reports : “ This Brandy is abso-
lutely pure, of very fine flavor and
high quality. Fusil-oil none;
poisonous matter, none.”
The absolute purity and superior quality of the STAMFORD OMIV6RSITY BRAMDY is personally guaranteed by T. W.
Stanford (Stanford & Co ), Melbourne, whose only interest in the sale of this Brandy is his desire to benefit the Institution with
which his name is associated, and of which he has the honor to be one of the Trustees.
As the StaQford Brafydy i& made of Wine only —5 to 6 gallons of wine being required to make one gallon of brandy—it is not
a CHEAP Brandy, and does not cofhpete IN PEACE with the Brandy in general use made of maize, beets, sugar, and occasionally of
malt and unsaleable wine. Consequently, the retail seller’s profit being less, he does not care to advocate its sale.

Inebriety may be agreeably avoided by
substituting in the case of those who run to bitter
beer syrup of orange and quinine diluted with
water. Confirmed inebriates are also much bene-
fited—especially the whisky variety—by the sub-
stitution for grog of a teaspoonful of nitro-
muriatic acid and a saltspoonful of quinine to a
tumbler of water.
The residents of a N.Q. township lately
filed a complaint of “ idleness and invisibility ”
against their one local policeman, who was not a
standing terror to depredating aboriginals. Being
asked to make their allegations more definite,

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
“One curse of London life,” says a
Bulletin writer, “is the degrading practice of
tipping. When a naked, half-starved Colombo
’rickshaw coolie begs you to give an anna over
and above his legal fare for making himself a
beast of burden, you haven’t the heart to say no ;
but when a hulking, fat, six-foot gross British
flunkey will haunt and dog your footsteps for a
‘tuppenny ’ tip, it gives one a feeling of horror to
see an alleged white man degrading himself to the
level of a nigger. All the big hotels, while
allegedly professing to forbid it ( vide notices in
their weekly bills), really encourage it. The
managements of these places pay Chinamen’s
wages to their servants, and the servants live on
the tips they get. The other day I was talking
to a well-known American authoress and her
brother in a London hotel. Her little boy of
four years or so was playing with an improvised
battledore and shuttlecock—last article made by
his uncle out of a champagne-cork. Presently we
all went upstairs into the ladies’ sitting-room, the
child leaving the toy behind him. In a few
minutes a great, fat, lumbering flunkey pre-
sented himself at the door holding out a
large salver. ‘ What is it ? ’ says the ’Murkan 1
lady’s brother. ‘ The young gentleman has left
his little toy behind him, sir.’ ‘Well, that’s all !
right. ’Tisn’t of much account, anyway.’ Waiter
bows and withdraws—as far as the door —then
says : ‘ I thought the young gentleman might
’ave missed it, sir ; thought I ’ad better bring hit
hup hat once, sir, yessir ’ —then shuffles his feet
and smiles expectantly. ‘All right,’ said the
’Murkan gentleman carelessly, ‘ much obliged.’
‘Yessir, thank you, sir; thought the young
gentleman better ’ave ’ ‘ Oh, get away, do,’
broke in the lady impatiently ; ‘ but, say, Henry,
just give him two pennies. It’s the custom here.
Maybe he wants to buy a bun .’ ”

Farewell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How long before the weary years
Will give my darling back to me,
Thro’ what dark mists of burning tears
And buried hopes our ways may be ?
I know not, but I fain would tell
All that I mean by this farewell.
I wonder will you ever turn
Your face towards the west, and say,
“ Does he, too, watch the sunset burn
From golden glory into grey,
And dream of what he could not tell,
But I might guess from his farewell ? ”
I wonder will you ever dream
Of those Australian afternoons ;
The whisperings from the hidden stream,
The shadows on the still lagoons.
When Love began to”weave his spell
Ere Duty bid me breathe farewell ?
Or will it be that you forget
The love-light of these summer days—
No memories, save a vagfue regret
That ours should be divergent ways ?
Then, sad as is a passing bell,
O’er broken vows is this farewell.
But if, perchance, in days to be
Stern Fortune’s wheel may turn again
And give me right to whisper free
The story of my love and pain,
Then you may listen when I tell
All that I mean by this farewell.

Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7th, 1895.
To Hebe Rassmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies. _
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform
you that I have derived great benefit from your
celebrated Alfaline Remedies during my explor-

sider them invaluable to all travellers in the bush,
—Yours very truly, B. BUTTON,

Witness : A. F. Bekeb, Manager, Grand Hotel,

Mr. Button writes later: —“The Pills I had
from you were of great benefit to me and others.
In one case, when three hunters and trappers
were travelling about the ranges near my place on
the Rose River, one was taken very ill; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. 1
gave him a few of your Pills. # I am pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Wish. Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform
you that your celebrated Alfaline Universal Pills

failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’
standing. My wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t
know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I
shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all
sufferers I come across. You are quite at liberty
to publish or make what use you like of this testi-
monial, and anyone writing to me will have full
■ particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E.

To Herr Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of ray friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.
Yours gratefully, J. NERVIN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first. of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.
Witness : Edward Hardy, proprietor Town

a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous

without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours,

A Better Advertis«n>eot
than we can construct is that which our
friends in the trade give us when they say
their Wheels are “the same grade as the
RAMBLER.”
‘RAMBLCR 6RAP€’
has a magic sound which “ high grade has
not. The latter phrase is dying —dying
from overwork. They must needs have
another, and they find it in the RAMBLER.
