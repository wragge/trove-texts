Creating fine wines is a matter of family pride with the Smiths of Yalumba . . . has been since
1849. This is one reason why Yalumba Moselle endears itself as a dinner companion. For
Yalumba makes Moselle from selected Rhine Riesling grapes into a light, bright, slightly sweet
wine bottled young and matured in the bottle for truly authentic character. Try Yalumba
Moselle just once; you’ll ask for it always.

how many times have you said it?
No room cooler or fan can reduce humidity. In fact,
room coolers actually increase humidity. (That’s how
they work —by water-cooling the air.) To get rid of
sizzling heat, as well as sticky humidity, you need a
Kelvinator Refrigerated Room Air Conditioner. (Removes
up to nine gallons of humidity each day.)
And it filters dust, pollen and germs from the air,
brings in and circulates fresh air, exhausts stale air
and smoke from the room as well as cooling and
dehumidifying. (All without plumbing and without water
tanks that need refilling.)

stronger
than
STEEL
Lysaght Red Orb Corrugated Steel Sheet
Why does Lysaght Steel Sheet have two lives?
Steel men call it “sacrificial protection.” It
starts when Lysaght Red Orb is coated with
a perfectly even deposit of zinc—l.7s ozs.
of zinc for each square foot of steel. This
combination of steel base and protective
zinc coating is normally good for a lifetime.
But accidents do happen. The life of any
sheet may be impaired by damage, but with
zinc coating the sheet’s second life then
starts. “Sacrificial protection” comes to the
rescue. The zinc coating corrodes locally
. . . but not the steel base.
It stays free of corrosion, with its strength
unimpaired. Call it “sacrificial protection.”
Call it “lifetime insurance.” Whatever you
call it, there is nothing more durable than
Lysaght Red Orb . . . and no better choice
for roofing and wall cladding.
Stocks of this famous sheet are available
from galvanized steel sheet merchants and
builders’ and plumbers’ supply houses in
your district. Ask for full information.

National Notebook
Scobie
Qcobie Breasley reached Melbourne
the other day. He seemed to us
to be a very fit grandpa. He’s 50 now,
but, for anyone as physically and mental-
ly toughened as this boy from Wagga
Wagga, jockeying clearly gives a longer
life at the top than comparably difficult
sports like bike-riding or chess.
Last August the VRC invited Breasley
to be its guest for the Cup as a crowd
attraction. It could not then promise a
Cup ride, but said there would surely
be plenty of offers. Scobie hit Mel-
bourne, however, to find offers rare.
He has under his cap by our count
five Caulfield Cups, two Sydney Cups,
two Moonee Valley Cups, and a Brisbane
Cup but no Melbourne Cup. Since he
went to England in 1950 he has been
champion jockey four times. He won the
English Derby this year on Santa Claus.
In that world of fine society and stubble-
faced spivery which is the English Turf
Scobie is said to pull down something
like £20,000 sterling a year.
Othello in the West
Oydney actor Ron Haddrick will leave
for Perth on December 21 to begin
rehearsals for the leading part in Robin
Lovejoy’s production of “Othello” and
for Autolycus in a local production of
“The Winter’s Tale” as part of the 1965
Perth Festival. This means Christmas
away from his family and wearing heavy
Shakespearean costumes through the
hottest month of the year.
However, Mr Haddrick thinks the
journey is worth it. January days are the
dog days for actors when only scraps of
work are left, so it’s the easiest time for
him to undertake a trip out of Sydney.
Also, he once understudied Harry
Andrew’s Othello at Stratford and thinks
he’d like to have a go at the part him-
self.
Although his trip is sponsored by the
Elizabethan, Mr Haddrick isn’t one of
the Trust’s solemn banner-carriers for
the theatre. And although on two occa-
sions he returned to Australia after suc-
cessful periods in English theatre, includ-
ing several seasons at Stratford, he
doesn’t wear the repatriation medal and
bar.
“Nobody owes us a living,” Mr Had-
drick says, although at the moment he
appears to be one of the few actors in
Sydney whose living is assured. Perhaps
it’s his attitude which assures his income.
Mr Haddrick prefers stage work but
Works in radio, television, films—when
they exist—and at narration. He finishes
Work in the second series of the ABC
children’s television serial, “The Stran-
ger”, which has been sold to America,
the day before he leaves for Perth. “Some
actors say ‘I don’t like radio’ or ‘I can’t
do television’,” he said. “But it’s just
your job and you’ve got to learn to like
it.”
However, Mr Haddrick, when he comes
to rest for a few moments after scurry-
ing between stage and studio, admits to
some disappointment that there has been
so little growth in theatre in Australia
in the past few years. He looks wist-
fully back on his days with the Trust
Players and cannot quite see why that
promising mould of actors had to be
broken.
And although Mr Haddrick works in
all mediums, he can see that it’s far from
the ideal way to work. Now in his middle
’thirties, Mr Haddrick is a generation
and a world apart from the actors who
until a few years ago earned a good,
steady living in radio and worked in the
amateur theatre, “doing a play for
Doris”, once in a while. He is a pro-
fessional actor and can’t see any other
way of being an actor.
He thinks yearly contracts are the only
really feasible way of building up drama
companies in several cities, particularly
when, say, a Sydney actor might be ask-
ed to go to Melbourne. ‘lt’s not only the
radio and television work you lose when
you take a stage role,” he said. “It’s
picking up the threads afterwards. That
takes at least three months, but for a
year on stage it might be worthwhile
to drop everything.”
Although Mr Haddrick has twice re-
turned to Australia from Britain, he keeps
an open mind about it. He might go
there a third time if things get tougher
here. However, he does agree that he
has had opportunities here that he most
certainly would never have got in Eng-
land.
“For instance, in England I would
never had played Azdek in ‘The Cauca-
sian Chalk Circle’,” he said. “There
would have been some actor who was
physically and in every way Azdek. And
over there you so easily get type-cast. I
have a fairly strong voice, so always at
Stratford I got the parts which needed a
good, strong voice. You can feel your-
self getting into a narrower and narrower
sphere. And you can’t go on playing
supporting roles at Stratford for ever.
Anthony Quayle and Glen Byam Shaw
both said to me, ‘As long as the parts we
offer you each year are bigger than the
ones you had last year, stick with us,
but once we offer you something smaller,
that’s the time to go’.”
What does he think would build up
audiences here? “Really good Austra-
lian plays might be one way,” he said.
“And we could try the star system. Of
course, it has disadvantages, but it does
work. It works in every field, even
sport. Bigger crowds will go to see a
Bradman or a Gasnier than will go to
see just cricket or football.”
But although Mr Haddrick had built
up a high reputation as an actor, and
may have a strong personal following
among playgoers, he knows that in the
minds of managements he’s still very
far from being a star.
“In the theatre you, or your agent,
might be able to press for more money
from leading roles or established repu-
tation,” he said. “But in radio and tele-
vision there’s just the rate for the job,

Surprise

F * reports in “The Australian” of

Titterton and the possibility of Aus-

we realised by Professor Titterton’s let-
ter to the same paper the next day that
we were not the only ones surprised.
“I read with considerable surprise your
teport in today’s issue (October 29) of
what I was supposed to have said in
Canberra yesterday,” Professor Titterton
wrote.
| “On returning from lunch on Wed-
nesday I found your science reporter,
Mr M. Daley, waiting to see me. He was
carrying a copy of the current issue of
The Bulletin which contains an article
of mine reviewing the position created
by the firing of the first Chinese nuclear
bomb and he asked for an additional
story.
“I told him that there was nothing I
wished to add to what I had said in
he article. I also warned him that quota-
tions from the article out of context
could be very misleading.
; “He offered the comment that if
quotations were used in acknowledgment
would be made to The Bulletin.

wind that you had access to the printed
material, misreporting is inexcusable.
“It does not seem very honest for
four reporter to pretend he got the

fact, it was rehashed, mainly from The
Bulletin.”
'Reproduction
T ow whistles of admiration greet the
appearance this week of a new

The Bird Bath
T)eople I know built a bird bath grand,
A stately thing of majestic dimensions,
Big enough for their own birds and
The birds of neighboring manors and
mensions.
It stood on a beryl and ruby plinth,
The outer rim was Carrara marble;
Never before and never sinth
Have birds been so wealthily wooed to
warble.
At night when its candelabra gleamed
On terraces glittering with obsidian,
The head of the house came out and
beamed
With his priceless teeth and his phore-
head Phidian.
There were walks and avenues, grottoes
cool,
And bird-size paths for the birds to strut
on,
And round the rim of the central pool
Titbits of ham and chicken and mutton.
An under-privileged family of
Say four or five with another coming
Might find there lots of room to love
And sleep and live with adequate plumb-
ing.
Yet the house’s head is confused and sad
And his family all bewildered with him;
They realise they’ve all been had,
In life they find no rhyme or rhythm.
Maybe it’s God they ought to sue,
The heresy’s almost past the uttering:
Those birds bathe hidden in the dew
In the dirty old galvanised iron guttering.
The bird bath stands within its keep
Remote, rejected, sad, deserted;
Those naughty birds cry: cheep, cheep,
cheep;
Self-centred, heartless, introverted.
PAT FLOWER
THE U.S. ELECTIONS
ffitfeulleiiti
80 Years Ago: November 15, 1884
Saturday’s ECHO contains a
thoughtful “leader”, evoked by
the Presidential contest in America.
According to the journal named, that
contest proved the superiority of
Monarchical over Republican institu-
tions. The wire-pullers published the
most scandalous tale of their oppo-
nents’ candidate; showed how humi-
liating it would be to place at the
head of affairs one who had cheated
at school, at the workshop, and at
the bar during his youth and prime,
and was open to cheat the nation
during his decline. It is a dreary re-
cord. It is just at this point that the
ECHO, with customary astuteness,
sweeps into the arena, and explains
how all these evils can be remedied
by the simple expedient of “Mon-
archy,” where the Chief Magistrate
is raised above such unseemly
struggles, and guides his or her people
by the “grace of God.” There is a
thought in this.
Let us glance at it . . . Of George
IV we can say with certainty he was
the first gentleman in Europe. He
invented a shoe-buckle. Of his son,
William IV, who had a head closely
resembling a pineapple, the impassive
Talleyrand, at a State dinner, said:
“Bien remarquable.” Our present
First Magistrate, Victoria, went down
into the literary arena, and proved
her superiority over George Eliot. Of
her apparent successor it is not neces-
sary to speak.
It is only necessary to think for a
moment what might be the result
if England today were a Republic.
Why Gladstone or Stuart Mill might
become Chief Magistrate. Think of
it! Even the person who wrote the
ECHO article might be chosen! But
enough. Even in speculation, however
free, there should be a well-defined
limit.

"And then put 'But vote for Johnson'."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Back to the Store in ’64?
rpHE 1964 American Presidential elec-
tion has been a spectacle in striking,
I and disappointing, contrast to the one
of 1960. John Kennedy and Richard
Nixon fought, or seemed to fight, an
election based on arguments and
issues symbolised in the great TV
debates and Americans and
foreigners alike felt that it was an
election worthy of the greatest Power
in the world. In fact, however, it is
now generally agreed that the result
was decided by a handful of votes
not by the arguments so ably pre-
sented on either side but by the fact
that Mr Nixon had a poorer TV image
than Mr Kennedy.
As if refusing to risk making the
same sort of mistake again, the two
candidates this time have tended to
shun arguments and issues and to
concentrate on rhetoric and image-
building. Mr Johnson has cultivated
what has been called the Daddybird
image presenting himself as the
forward-looking father of all Ame-
ricans from oppressed Negroes to big
business, as the man who knows how
to dampen down tensions and to keep
America on the move to the Great
Society of equality, peace and pros-
perity. He says, in effect, that he is
the personification of reasonableness
and reliability.
Senator Goldwater has also shunned
serious arguments (they are too com-
plex, he claimed evasively, for the
hustings) and has presented himself
as the courageous custodian of the
true American values against Big Gov-
ernment at home and Communism
abroad. To dramatise his differences
with President Johnson, he chose to
follow the apparently unpopular course
of going to poverty-stricken Appa-
lachia to attack the President’s type of
anti-poverty measure, to Florida to
attack Medicare, to Tennessee to
attack the Tennessee Valley Authority,
in each case appealing to the “Ame-
rican” values he believes his listeners
secretly hold true. (“In your heart you
know he is right”.)
But although both candidates have
cultivated their images of Fatherly
Reasonableness or Conscientious
Courage, they have also both been open
to damaging counter-images, and the
election has drummed up its share of
smears. Johnson’s critics, including
many Democrats, have suspected his
association with men like Mr Bobby
Baker and have presented him as a
wheeler-dealer over-tolerant of, or
conceivably involved in, corruption.
Goldwater’s critics, including many
Republicans, have presented him as
an irresponsible madman who depends
on extremist kooks.
If, as seems certain at the time of
going to press, President Johnson is
returned to power, the next significant
question will be what will now happen
to the Goldwaterite movement. Form-
ally Senator Goldwater, if beaten, will
have no more power in the Republican
Party than Mr Nixon had after 1960,
but one would be foolish to write off
the dedication that Senator Goldwater
has aroused among his followers,
especially among young people a
dedication that grows on each new
Press attack on the Senator and on
each new American setback in Cuba,
the Congo or Indo-China. Nothing
like it has been seen since the early
days of F. D. Roosevelt, and already
they are planning for the 1966 Con-
gressional elections and after
The real nature of this movement
is still unclear, but it seems to have
l, n ked genuine conservatives, who
believe that “Me-Too” Republicanism

vausm over the past 35 years, with all
sorts of fringe extremist groups, such
as the John Birch Society, which have
nothing positive to contribute. If the
genuine conservatives can find a
sounder leader than Goldwater (who,
to be fair, is himself more a conser-
vative Republican than an extremist)
and can democratise or detach them-
selves from the wild fringe groups,
then Goldwater’s legacy may be a
genuine two-party system in America
based on the liberal-conservative
dichotomy familiar in other countries.
This, in perspective, may be the best
thing Goldwater has done. But it
seems also clear that he himself lacks
the capacity to arouse the trust that
a national leader must have.
The “Peace ” Front
T ast week’s “Peace” Congress in
Sydney turned out to be even
more tightly controlled by the Com-
munists than the 1959 Congress. Not
one motion criticising, however mildly,
any policy of the Soviet Union or its
satellites was permitted to pass, while
a host of motions attacking the free
world were adopted. (See story page
14). The Congress was willing to
denounce Australian treatment of
Aborigines or American treatment of
Negroes, but would not denounce
Soviet persecution of Jews. It
denounced American “cultural aggres-
sion” but would not attack Polish or
East German persecution of intellec-
tuals or the Russian imprisonment of
famous poets such as J B. Brodsky.
It demanded the admission of Com-
munist China to the United Nations,
but scorned an amendment calling for
a guarantee of the territorial integrity
of Formosa with its 12 million people.
It attacked American imperialism, but
rejected any condemnation of Red
China’s invasion of India; it even re-
jected the idea that Australia should
help any Asian power under attack.
It demanded “peace” on Soviet terms,
but would not accept a resolution cal-
ling on the Soviet Government to lift
its prohibition of pacifist literature in
the Soviet Union,
The Congress was, in short, a
blatant Communist front and those
innocent sponsors, who scorned all
the early evidence of this, must, or
should, feel ashamed of themselves.
They simply helped the international
gangsters try to build an atmosphere in
which they hope to be able to “bury
us”. It is no thanks to them that the
Communists were exposed and that
the Congress was, from the Com-
munist point of view, a failure.
But one other disturbing feature of
the whole affair is that the daily news-
papers, with the honorable exception
Q f the Sydney “Daily Telegraph”,
failed to report the Congress with
either insight or thoroughness, despite
the importance attached to it by the
Federal Government. Indeed, the
Communists may well have got away
with their ramp sut for the dctai i e d
and fascinating daily exposures writ-
ten by Alan Reid. This is, indeed, an
alarming commentary on the Aus-
tralian Press.


THIS AUSTRALIA
PEACE CONGRESS
What Really Happened
AT THE SYDNEY STADIUM.
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Otepping out to the swirl of the bag-
pipes, Mr Sam Goldbloom and the
Rev. Mr Dickie marched down Bays-
water Road, Sydney, towards the Sydney
Stadium. Acknowledging the applause
of the crowd, the tall man Goldbloom
was a latter-day Don Quixote come
to tilt at the war-mongering windmills
of the West; alongside and keeping well
in step marched the faithful parson, a
loyal Sancho Panza. The two had
marched before in New Dehli and
Colombo in 1957, at meetings of the
World Peace Council, and in Melbourne
in 1959 at the ANZ Congress. This time
they were leading the Victorian delega-
tion to the 1964 Australian Congress for
International Co-operation and Dis-
armament. As the two men entered the
Stadium both smiled cheerfully.
They were in fact showing the two
different faces of the Congress. One face
was that of Mr Goldbloom, speaking
for the organisers at the first meeting
of the Academics’ Conference the next
day. When Dr Frank Knopfelmacher of
Melbourne University asked if there
would be an opportunity for resolutions
and amendments to come from the floor,
Mr Goldbloom smilingly answered there
would be. “Otherwise you would cut
our throats,” he said. The result was that
the Academics’ Conference in company
with the Writers’ Conference and the
Churchmen’s Conference were conducted
strictly according to procedure.
Mr Dickie showed another face, not
so smiling this time. During his chair-
manship of a session of the Citizens’
Conference a Sydney University student,
Mr Peter Manning, tried to add the sup-
pression of Jewish minority rights in the
Soviet Union to a list of breaches of
the Declaration of Human Rights which
included Australia’s treatment of the
Aborigines, the delays in transferring
independence to New Guinea, the Negro
question in the United States, Apartheid
in South Africa, interference in South
Vietnam, a denial of choice in Cyprus,
and the retention of foreign troops and
bases in Malaysia. Although Mr Man-
ning was the first to speak on the matter,
and although his amendment should
have had priority, it was never discussed
or voted on because another amendment
moved subsequently was put first and
accepted. Mr Dickie saw to that. The
amendment meant that instead of
naming any countries specifically the
report referred to “all countries”.
From the viewpoint of the organisers
and especially the members of the Com-
munist Party and their sympathisers the
key conferences were the Citizens, Edu-
cation, Youth and Trade Unions. They
could not be left to fair and orderly
procedure. But whatever the degree of
control or manipulation within the
various autonomous conferences, the re-
sults were remarkably similar. These are
that no conference ever accepted any
move which was even mildly critical of
the Soviet Union or of the Eastern Bloc
countries; that none accepted any sig-
nificant departures from the stated
foreign policy of the Soviet Union or its
general policies on peace and disarma-
ment, and that there was a large prepon-
derance of anti-Western moves accepted,
especially directed against the defence
policies of the United States and Aus-
tralia.
The two “permissive” conferences of
particular interest were the Academics
and the Writers. Except for American
scientist Dr Linus Pauling, twice awarded
the Nobel Prize, and the small group of
three Melbourne University academics
(Dr Frank Knopfelmacher, Messrs Brian
White and John Chandler), who were
at odds with the conference on practically
every major issue, there were no philoso-
phers, historians, political scientists or
literary academics. This may explain
some of the discussions and final con-
clusions which reflected a tendency to
be impressed with technological achieve-
ment and a reluctance to grapple with
the moral, social or political problems
involved in peace and disarmament.
Except for one or two individuals,
there were no members of the Com-
munist Party at this conference. The
large majority were Left-wing Liberals
who revealed both their guilt feelings
and their concern at the failure of the
West to move towards peace. Overbur-
dened with a sense of the corrupting
influence that the United States exerts
in Asia, willing to appease and concede
but unwilling to ask for concessions, the
academics revealed a general naivete in
their assessment of the problems of peace
and disarmament.
This conference rejected a resolution
reading: “This meeting holds that the
danger of war can be reduced if the pro-
cess of convergence between the USA
and the USSR continues.” Speakers who
opposed it told the mover, Dr Knop-
felmacher, that the resolution implied
concessions from only one side and was
therefore unacceptable. The conference
also rejected by a large majority a reso-
lution deploring the recent persecution
of intellectuals, artists and writers in
Poland, Yugoslavia, USSR and East
Germany. The conference rejected an
amendment to a resolution calling for
the admission of Red China to the
United Nations. The amendment called
for a guarantee of the territorial integrity
of Taiwan. It was argued that prior con-
ditions should not be imposed in advance
of China's admission.
rpHOSE resolutions which were passed in-
eluded some on the removal of barri-
ers to free movement of academics, the
need for greater contacts between aca-
demics in Communist countries and the
West, proposals for research into the ef-
fects of the proposed French hydrogen
bombs and urging the Australian Govern-


ment to send a gift of one million tons
of wheat to India.
The Writers’ Conference was another
example of an autonomous conference
leaning over backwards to be fair.
Unlike the 1959 conference in Mel-
bourne where some leading non-Com-
munist writers did participate, this time
the conference was marked by the low
standard of participation. Robert Fitz-
gerald, lon Idriess, Kylie Tennant, and
Alan Marshall sent messages but those
who attended were largely nonentities
even in Australia’s small literary world.
The exceptions were the Communist
writers Frank Hardy and Judah Waten
who played leading roles.
At the first session the visiting Kenyan
MP, Mr Omolo Agar, told the writers
of his concern at the poisonous litera-
ture from Eastern European countries
and China which was flooding Kenya.
He described it as distasteful and dan-
gerous. In the discussion which followed
there were some six or seven speakers,
but none took up Mr Agar’s specific
theme. Other speakers called for writers
to have integrity, for them to reject
cliches like the United States “is peace
loving” while China is warmongering,
for them to realise that the “goodies and
baddies” were on both sides and for a
realisation that reading about the Czech
production of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?” was an aid to understanding
the Sydney production because the Czech
production (which the particular writer
had not seen) was a more profound one.
The second night of discussion was
at a similarly mundane and common-
place level giving little indication that
anyone had thought very deeply about
the writer's art and its relation to peace
and disarmament. Many of the writers
were well meaning but it was often
doubtful in what sense some of them
were writers or what they had actually
written. Perhaps the most revealing
meeting of the writers was the business
session, divided into two sections
“The Responsibility of the Writer in a
Nuclear Age” and “Freedom of Ex-
pression and Communication.” The first
topic was covered in about half an hour,
with some unexceptionable resolutions.
The second session resolved itself into
difference between Melbourne journalist
Sam Lipski and the rest of the confer-
ence except for occasional support from
one other non-Communist, Mr J. M.
Zube.
Foreshadowing a series of resolutions
on restrictions of freedom of writers and
their imprisonment in the Soviet Union,
South Africa, Indonesia, Yugoslavia,
Poland, East Germany and Spain, Mr
Fipski moved his first resolution on the
ease of Josef Brodsky, who is a 24-
year-old Russian poet whose failure to
conform to Soviet standards of literary
“work” resulted in his arrest on charges
of “parasitism.” The resolution condemn-
ed the Brodsky trial, urged his release,
noted with apprehension the anti-Semitic
innuendoes of the Judge, and voiced
concern about the continuing persecution
of Russian writers and intellectuals. It
was opposed by Mr W. Irwin on the
grounds that the transcript of the Brod-
sky trial had appeared in two “partisan”
journals, “Encounter” and “New Lea-
der.” He suggested that there was insuf-
ficient information on the case available
and that it should be referred to Amnesty
International, the London-based organ-
isation concerned with the release of
political prisoners.
Mr Lipski then condemned the pub-
lication of two Russian anti-Semitic
books, “Judaism Without Embellish-
ment,” by T. Kichko, and A. Mayatsky’s
“Contemporary Judaism and Zionism.”
Frank Hardy considered the conference
should concern itself with these problems
and asked Mr Lipski if he would con-
sider moving only two resolutions
one on Brodsky and one on the Spanish
writer Ridruejo imprisoned in Spain. Mr
DR LINUS PAULING
Lipski refused. Mr Judah Waten opposed
the motion because it used “strong lan-
guage” and because both the books had
been withdrawn. He said it had been
published before the official Soviet con-
demnation of the Kichko book. This is
correct but Mr Waten was wrong on
the banning of the second book.
The greatest enthusiasms of the con-
ference was for Mr Hardy’s condemna-
tion of “American cultural aggression”
on the Australian literary and mass
media scene. He said that Australian
writers were far worse off than those
in the Soviet bloc because they were
prevented from reaching their public.
He was applauded when he called for
the implementation of the Vincent
Report.
Now two conferences which demon-
strated the hard line of control organi-
sationally and in policy were the Educa-
tion Conference and the Youth Con-
ference. At the former a motion calling
for freedom to disseminate pacifist litera-
ture became one to disseminate literature
for international co-operation and dis-
armament. Pacifist literature may not be
handed out in the Soviet Union. But Mr
Don Taylor said that the motion had
been “fraudulent and dishonorable”. The
early publicity given to this and other
moves to change and “kill” embarrassing
resolutions probably harmed the Con-
gress.
The Youth Conference was also very
tightly organised and rejected motions
condemning Red China’s aggression
against India, supporting the ANZUS and
SEATO treaties, and supporting the right
of Australia to come to the aid of any
Asian country under attack. The confer-
ence accepted motions opposing national
service and calling for the withdrawal
of Australian forces in Malaysia and
Vietnam.
Tt was a small unrepresentive conference
with extreme Left-wingers and mem-
bers of the Eureka Youth League com-
bining to put over the Party line. It did
reveal some of the underlying tensions
between the pro-China and pro-Soviet
groups but did little else beyond con-
demning the idea of sailing a ship into
the French hydrogen bomb test area.
The key word at the conference was
divisive. You were divisive if you were
in any way critical of the Soviet Union
or its allies. You were not divisive if you
criticised the United States or any of its
allies. This speaks volumes about what
the Congress achieved in relation to peace
and in relation to the furtherance of
Communist aims.
All this must raise more than just
doubts about the Congress. It was hardly
Liberal in any sense of the word for it
failed to take seriously some of the real
problems of peace and disarmament, such
as the problems of inspection of nuclear
weapons and arsenals which the Soviet
objects to, the Berlin Wall, the aggression
of Indonesia against Malaysia and any
attempt to call for the liberalisation of
restrictions on freedom in the Eastern
bloc. It was a generally dull, drab and
often meaningless five days of talk by
well-meaning people who have provided
the ready audiences of the peace mongers
in the past.

developing into a restrictive practices in-
quiry) were promptly quashed by E.
Reece's Tasmanian Government last
month when it gazetted chairman Pro-
fessor J. Mcß. Grant as a Royal Com-
missioner.
In a writ out of the Supreme Court,
Mr J. D. Holmes, QC, had sought a dec-
laration that Professor Grant had not
been legally constituted as a Board of In-
quiry. Mr Holmes said the Evidence Act
of 1910 called for a Board of at least two
people. Only a chairman could sum-
E. REECE
J. D. HOLMES
mon witnesses . . . and how could Pro-
fessor Grant be a chairman of himself?
The Inquiry began in Tasmania on
September 29 under the chairmanship of
Professor Grant, Professor of Applied
Economics at the University of Tas-
mania. (He is the sole member of the
Board of Inquiry.) The terms of refer-
ences indicated that Professor Grant
would determine whether Tasmanian
prices of nominated goods and services
were excessive and whether they had
risen unreasonably since May last. From
the outset the spotlight was on restric-
tive trade practices and collusive tender-
ing. This trend became especially evi-
dent when a Hobart car dealer, Mr N. B.
Basstian, told the Inquiry of terms of
trade imposed in the tyre and retreading
business. Mr Basstian claimed that deal-
ers lost discounts for deviating from
those terms.
Mr R. K. Fullagar, QC, submitted
that these practices were outside the In-
quiry’s scope because no price rises had
occurred in tyres since 1955. Professor
Grant rejected Mr Fullagar’s submission
but agreed to delay the calling of evi-
dence from Messrs B. R. Davis and B.
Blair, representing tyre dealers and re-
treaders’ associations. On October 13
Mr J. D. Holmes, QC (appearing for
Davis and Blair), challenged the legality
of the Inquiry and issued a writ out of
the Supreme Court. He then suggested
the Inquiry should adjourn until the
Supreme Court dealt with the writ.
The same day as the writ was issued
the Government hurriedly introduced
“after-thought” legislation to “remove
doubts” over the applicability of the
Evidence Act of 1910. On October 15
the House of Assembly rushed through
the Government’s Evidence (Doubts Re-
moval) Bill which provided that one
person could be a Board of Inquiry
within the Act. The Bill was made
retrospective to December 13, 1934,
thereby avoiding the possibility of earlier
inquiries becoming the subjects of de-
famation and other action in the courts.
However, the Legislative Council main-
tained that the rush legislation related
to a subject which was sub judice and
subsequently decided to adjourn its de-
cision despite Government pleas.
Thwarted in the House the Govern-
ment within hours gazetted Professor
Grant a Royal Commissioner—a legally
assured appointment. On October 20
the Inquiry resumed and 15 witnesses
resubmitted evidence previously given
and since then other witnesses have ap-
peared. The delay, however, has given
firms time to prepare rebuttals and ex-
planations—even some of the evidence
is taking a new slant.
OIL
Moonie Costly
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Ampol should soon be hearing from
the Queensland Government after
its announcement last week that, be-
cause of the high price, its refinery, due
to be completed in Brisbane next year,
would not be using Moonie oil. One of
the ideas behind siting this refinery, the
first major one to be constructed by an
Australian-owned petroleum group, at
the end of the Moonie pipeline was to
use the oil which would flow through.
But the oil is apparently too expensive,
at least in comparison with overseas
crudes which Ampol now says it has
contracted to use on a long-term basis.
Nobody will blame the company for
seeking the cheapest supplies for its
operations and apparently it has man-
aged to get contracts for oil at something
like 20 p.c. under posted prices. “Ampol
cannot subsidise Australia’s indigenous
oil,” said the company’s managing direc-
tor, Mr W. M. Leonard, last week. “It

Foil caps millions of milk bottles each
week. Since it’s a metal, foil is moisture-
proof and impervious to liquids and
grease. Being malleable, it forms a tight-
fitting and hygienic cap and so protects
product purity.
Foil has insulated acres of roofing. Being
highly reflective, aluminium keeps build-
ings warmer in winter, cooler in summer.
That’s why foil is used so extensively in
insulating modern homes and offices.
Foil has protected millions of pharma-
ceutical tablets. An effective barrier
against moisture and sunlight, foil main-
tains the quality and composition of
capsules and tablets. “Strip” packaging
means that tablets are exposed only as
they are used.
Foil has held millions of pies and TV
dinners. Foil is invaluable in packaging
foodstuffs because it seals in flavour and
freshness. It is ideal for disposable con-
tainers. And products that come in foil
always stand out, because foil is a real
eye-catcher.
Foil has sheathed hundreds of miles of
cables. Electrical screening is one of
foil's many applications. It’s also an
excellent electrical conductor, and is
widely used in industry for this purpose.
Foil has wrapped tons of confectionery.
Another excellent example of foil’s many
protective properties: in this case, it seals
in flavour and ensures factory-freshness.
Australuco, with its well-established
and specialised facilities, produces a full
range of basic foil products for use in
converting and packaging. Australuco’s
engineers and technicians are backed by
the world-wide experience and knowledge
of the Alcan Group, and are able to sup-
ply the latest information about the many
applications of aluminium foil in all
phases of Australian industry.

So far since Moonie oil began to flow
through the pipeline the international oil
companies have been taking it, though
not at a price which pleases them. They
say that if all the oil used in Australian
refineries at present were priced on the
same basis as they are paying for Moonie
crude it would cost the imports bill
another £20 million. In terms of the pre-.
sent supply position overseas it seems
patently clear the Moonie people are
asking too much.
The question now is whether the re-
fining companies, including Ampol,
should be pressurised by the Federal and
Queensland authorities. Clearly, if oil
search is to continue on the scale needed
to prove adequate reserves of crude oil
are here, a compromise will have to be
reached, with any subsidy necessary corm
ing from the Federal purse.
With the oil finders and the oil users
pulling in opposite directions no time
should be lost in pushing on with a
national fuel policy and the formation
of a Ministry for Power in Canberra.
DEADLOCKS
" An Inspired Solution”
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
Cir Robert Cosgrove, a former
Premier of Tasmania, has described
a plan to remove all likelihood of dead-
locks between the House of Represen-
tatives and the Senate in the future as
“an inspired solution to a grave national
problem.” The plan distributed to
Federal Parliamentarians last week by
Mr George Howartt, MA, a research
scholar at the University of Tasmania,
was contained in an 84-page report
“Resolving Senate-House Deadlocks in
Australia without Endangering the
Smaller States”. Mr Howatt completed
the report in 1961 but it was not tabled
until May this year.
In the report the former Fulbright
scholar from the University of Penn-
sylvania, who has been engaged in re-
search work in Tasmania since 1957,
said his plan would resolve deadlocks
without:
• Reducing the power of the Senate;
• Weakening the representation of the
smaller States;
• Changing the method of Senate elec-
tions;
• Increasing the number of Senators.
According to Mr Howatt the plan
is designed to overcome previous objec-
tions to attempts at remedying deadlocks
by recommending a new feature in
parliamentary procedure the use of
six panels of Senators (one panel for
each State) with each panel empowered
to cast one vote on behalf of its State.
The panels would consist of five mem-
bers each chosen from the 10 Senators
of each State. Three members of each
panel would be elected by the Govern-
ment members of the Senate and two
by the Opposition. Should the deadlock
plan be adopted, voting in the Senate
would then involve two steps: first the
60 Senators would vote for or against a
motion, then the chairman of each of
the six State panels would announce
the decision of his panel. Thus the
outcome of a motion would depend on
the individual votes of the Senators, plus
the votes of the State panels.
Mr Howatt pointed out that the avail-
ability of the State panel votes would
assist the Senate to sustain the Govern-
ment if the Senate chose to. But if the
Government in the House of Represen-
tatives proposed measures which threat-
ened the Senate or the smaller States, the
Senate would still have its ordinary votes
plus the six panel votes to defeat, the
proposals.
Sir Robert Cosgrove said further of
the plan that it could avert deadlocks
“without endangering the Senate and its
values to the smaller States. Unless
satisfactory measures are adopted for
solving House-Senate disagreements,
moves inevitably will be taken to strip
the Senate of its real powers.”
It is expected that Parliament will
discuss the report early next year.

However, after the film had been rush-
ed to Sydney for editing, the anti-hanging
State Labor Opposition asked the WA
Government to have the documentary
shelved. Premier D. Brand, who had de-
clined to be interviewed in the show,
passed the request on to the ABC hier-
archy. Subsequently the film was ban-
ned, even though it was denied political
pressure had been applied.
Then, on the Saturday night, Four
Corners included in its broadcast a dis-
cussion on the right of a journalist to
refuse to reveal his sources of inform-
ation and earned itself a rebuke from
Mr Justice G. Wallace in the NSW
Supreme Court. Mr Justice Wallace last
week presided over a libel case brought
by Labor MLA Mr J. C. Earl against
the Sydney “Sun” newspaper, in which
a journalist, Mr Joseph Buchanan, re-
peatedly refused to reveal the sources
of his information. Mr Justice Wallace
later ordered Buchanan to show cause
before the Full Supreme Court this
month why he should not be committed
for contempt of court.
Last week ABC officials refused to
discuss with The Bulletin the double
trouble but it is known that some inter-
nal action has or will take place. Per-
haps the ABC will even release a state-
ment as to the attitudes of its controver-
sial Four Corners programme.
LAW I
“Pure Spite”?
FROM ROBERT KLIMA IN SYDNEY
since he has had the power to
cancel drivers’ licences, Mr W. A.
Walsh, the Commissioner for Motor
Transport, has been criticised for abusing
it. Criticism went one step further in
Redfern Court last week when a magi-
strate upheld a taxi-driver’s appeal
against Mr Walsh’s cancellation of his
licence. The driver, William John Gor-
man of Marine Parade, Maroubra, was
originally summonsed by Mr Walsh for
improper conduct in demanding more
than the prescribed fare.
A Redfern Traffic Court magistrate
found the offence not proved and dis-
missed the summons, awarding court
c °sts against the Commissioner. Un-
daunted, Mr Walsh cancelled Gorman’s
licence on the ground that he was not a
fit and proper person to hold the
licence. When Gorman appealed against
Ihe cancellation his counsel, Mr R. Serio,
said the Commissioner was seeking to
asurp the function of the Court and
'mpose a new arbitrary standard. “I
submit this is a pure and unadulterated
example of spite on the part of the
Commissioner,” he said.
Mr J. L. Craddock, SM, said it was
not the normal province of the Court to
express criticism of the way the Com-
missioner exercised his powers. “The
Commissioner has, by his actions, ex-
posed himself to the suggestion that on
this occasion he has abused the power
conferred on him. I won’t elaborate on
that except to say that the appeal is
upheld.” The decision apparently hit
home because the next day Transport
Department officers went to the court-
house and obtained photostat copies of
the depositions.

scene by a City Magistrate, Mr J. Kean.
Copies of Solar (produced six times
a year and selling around 14,000 an
issue) together with an English nudist
publication “Health and Efficiency”,
“Camera in Japan”, and “Saloon Photo”
were seized by members of the Mel-
bourne Vice Squad at the premises of
William Darragh and Son in Russell
Street on October 14. Senior Constable
P. Tunsall of the squad also seized 67
copies of “Face and Figure”, an Ameri-
can photographic magazine.
In court Mr Kean said that although
“Solar” incorporated photographs of the
nude female body, there was not an un-
due emphasis on matters of sex; but he
felt it would have a corrupting influence
on people whose minds were open to
immoral tendencies. Mr Kean also
found “Face and Figure” to be obscene
and ruled that the magazines seized be
destroyed.
Meanwhile in Sydney Mr John Bos-
well, secretary of the Australian Fed-
eration of Sun Clubs, said the Federation
would lodge an appeal against Mr
Kean’s decision.
COMMUNISTS
Off to Moscow
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Oooked to leave Sydney for Moscow
** on November 3, Mr Laurie Aarons
should have no trouble in accommoda-
ting his ideas to those of Mr L. I.
Brezhnev. Indeed, Aarons should get
along especially well with Brezhnev as
both have had similar and simultaneous
problems—how to dump the old men.
While Brezhnev has been concerned with
Khrushchev, Aarons is occupied with
Sharkey.
Although Sharkey was re-elected as
general secretary of the Communist
Party of Australia at its 22nd Congress,
it was only a token gesture in the cause
of unity. Aarons has been the real
leader all the way, and the vigor of his
leadership has surprised many.
He has done what had to be done
T. HILL
with the three main
groups in the CPA.
Those who, along
with Mr Ted Hill,
swore allegiance to
China he drove out.
although some Hill
supporters still re-
main in the Party.
Aarons himself
assumed early lead-
ership of the “soft”
line pro-Soviet for-
ces and by adopting
a still more extreme “soft” line he made
allies of the surprisingly large group
comprised mainly of intellectuals, stand-
ing to the right of the Khrushchev line
who have become known as the Italian-
liners by virtue of the fact that they see
in the Italian CP programme the way to
power in Australia. Here perhaps lies
trouble, as already a group of Central
Committee members maintain that the
pro-Italian group is growing too strong.
But for the present, Aarons is not wor-
ried. Mr Sharkey, however, is not
booked to leave Sydney until November
12. He should reach Moscow in time
to say “Yes” to whatever has already
been agreed upon by Aarons.
BOXING
Again, Doldrums
BY DISCUS
Oid Prior and Rocky Gattellari rescued
boxing from one of its doldrums
two years ago, as each was passing
through thin ranks of local and imported
fighters towards the national titles. Then
Sid Prior retired, not too damaged and j
with a quick £5OOO. Rocky is still
going, undamaged but not affluent.
Accidents and a shortage of opponents
have reduced his average income. Again,
the doldrums.
Few athletic
men want to
fight. The
national title-
holder of pro-
mise, feather-
weight Johnny
Famechon. is
too good for
most locals,
not experienc-
ed enough for
good imports.
So profes-
sional boxing
marks time,
R. GATTELLARI
waiting as it did after 1960 for the >
Olympic amateurs to infuse their blood
into the game. There is no guarantee /
that any will. Of the 1960 crop, in-
cluding Ollie Taylor and the Males, only
Rocky is still enthusiastic, and he has
made more in business than ever in
boxing. In a television interview, Olym-
pic middleweight Barber has said he is
an unlikely professional, quoting the
share of the gate paid to the Australian
middleweight champion, Reg Hayes, at
his last fight—£4o.
Gattellari is alone as Australia’s first-i
class boxer. He proved that in two
fights against Perez. It was an insult to
put him in with Kunde last week,
although a more experienced fighter than
Gattellari could have made the bout last
longer. His “fight a month” plan sug-
gests that he intends to keep the game
going by his efforts alone. But who is
he going to fight each month? There
are no flyweights in Australia worth his
time or the customers’, with the possible
exception of Allottey.
The issue is important because what
happens to Rocky will influence simi-
larly talented men for or against boxing
in the near future, and boxing will stand
or fall by it. The blood-bath days are long
over but the public will still pay good
money to see real boxers.
Last week the only good moment of
the whole night was the brief reappear-
ance of Ron Richards, great middle-*
weight of the 30s, grey-haired, a bit
stiff, received with a great roar of tribute!
from the crowd. Those were the days, i


The World’s Election
LBJ high above the battle
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
If Barry Goldwater wins the presi-
dency of the United States from
Lyndon Johnson, in the face of every
sign and portent, the biggest losers would
not be the Democrats, who could reason-
ably hope to recover and win again one
day, but the Gallups, the Ropers, the
Lubells, the Harrises and the rest of the
professional pollsters, who would be
hopelessly discredited for ever more.
Never in the brief history of their
divining art have these seers been quite
so unanimous nor quite so positive
certainly not in their notoriously erron-
eous prognostications of 1948—as they
were in their predictions that Johnson
would defeat Goldwater on November 3.
An intriguing aspect of these one-
sided forecasts was the possibility that
they might boomerang against the
heavily-favored Democratic candidate
through their sheer one-sidedness. In a
country where 40 per cent of the eligible
voters never go to the polls anyhow,
(since voting is not compulsory) it was
conceivable that Democrats by the
hundreds of thousands would remain at
home on election day in the conviction
that their man was a certainty to win
without them. Democratic Party leaders
were determined to counteract this over-
confidence, or apathy, through unprece-
dented get-out-the-vote drives at the pre-
cinct level.
Another aspect of the forecasts was
the comparatively close races they pre-
dicted on the congressional and other
lesser political levels. The personality
and image of Barry Goldwater was re-
sponsible for the sharp, unprecedented
division in the presidential race. Much
of the strength in the Johnson column
was a reflection of the fierce anti-Gold-
water feeling his ultra-conservative
stance had stirred up during the cam-
paign. But Democratic candidates were
having tough going in many States des-
pite the tradition that a strong presiden-
tial candidate pulls the rest of the ticket
along “on his shirt tails”. Rarely in
recent elections had so much ticket-
splitting—dividing of votes between can-
didates of opposite parties—been in
prospect.
“Carpet-baggers” an issue
Tn California, for example, where the
President was running strongly,
Senator Pierre Salinger, the late Presi-
dent Kennedy’s Press secretary, was
struggling to retain his seat against the
formidable opposition of Republican
George Murphy, the former star of
musicals. Here the glamor of Holly-
wood was pitted against the glamor of
close association with the martyred Pre-
sident. The epithet “carpet-bagger” had
been hurled against the portly Pierre by
the Republicans inasmuch as he had
spent so much time in residence in
Washington that he was no longer
technically a resident of California.
(The reference of course was to the
northern carpet-baggers who invaded the
defeated south seeking political or finan-
cial plunder after the Civil War.) Most
polls showed Salinger only slightly
ahead of Murphy.
Carpet-bagging also became an active
issue in the New York State senatorial
campaign this year, when the late Pre-
sident’s brother, Robert Kennedy, re-
signed his post as US Attorney-General
to seek the senate seat now occupied by
Republican Kenneth Keating. The lat-
ter pointed out, accurately, that Bobby
Kennedy was not only ineligible to vote
in New York but had not lived in the
State since he was a schoolboy. “He
thinks the Gowanus Canal is a part of
the alimentary tract,” contended Keat-
ing, referring to a notorious waterway
in the depths of Brooklyn.
Keating further contended, probably
with much justice, that Bobby was intent
upon becoming a United States senator
to further his ambitions to occupy the
White House. Keating is one of the
many liberal Republican politicians who
refused to support Goldwater’s candi-
dacy this year. This independence, plus
much resentment against newcomer Ken-
nedy, made the senatorial race in New
York one of the closest political battles
in the country.
These are only two of the many
(800,000 political offices are being decid-
ed throughout the country) contests which
have been more publicised in the cam-
paign. Ticket-splitting will figure largely
in Michigan, where Republican Gover-
nor George Romney, a bitter foe of
Senator Goldwater, is slightly favored
to defeat Democrat Neil Staebler. De-
troit, the major city, is the base of the
politically powerful United Auto Work-
ers’ Union, which is solidly anti-Gold-
water, but Romney’s strength lies in

In Arkansas, a southern border State,
Governor Orval Faubus, a notorious
racist, is battling for his sixth consecu-
tive term against Winthrop Rockefeller,
younger brother of New York’s anti-
Goldwater Governor, Nelson Rockefel-
ler. Rockefeller, a gentleman-farming
newcomer to Arkansas, has adopted
cowboy boots and ten-gallon hat and is
campaigning on his record of attracting
600 new industries to the fast-growing
State. Faubus has countered by “smear-
ing” Winthrop with his brother's liberal
political convictions. Arkansas is ex-
pected to give Johnson—and Faubus—a
winning margin.
Intriguing as were these lesser con-
tests in the kaleidescopic American poli-
tical scene, the spotlight never really
wavered from the two contenders for
the White House. Starting from an
underdog stance, the Republican candi-
date has sought to find an issue or series
of issues which would swing a majority
of the electoral vote, if not the popular
vote, to his banner. It must be remem-
bered that the President of the United
States is elected by members of the so-
called “electoral college” who meet after
election day and cast ballots for the
Presidency. These electors are chosen
in each State, after the voters of that
State signify—by their individual ballots
—which candidate they prefer. A
simple majority of these individual votes
determines which way the State electors
must vote. This is a “winner take all —
loser take nothing” approach known as
the unit rule. The number of electors
in each State is the same as the number
of its senators and representatives in
Congress which is determined by
the State’s total population—obviously
therefore the most populated States are
the most critical in the Presidential
election.
New York, the largest State in the
Union, is the biggest prize, with 43
electoral votes. The smallest States
(Alaska, Hawaii, Delaware, Nevada,
Vermont and others) possess the mini-
mum of three electoral votes. In this
election 270 electoral votes will be re-
quired to take the Presidency.
Goldwater’s hopes for victory rested
from the beginning on building a solid
base of electoral votes in the Deep
South, traditionally Democratic but to
be won over by his anti-Civil Rights
position, and adding to it scattered
south-western and western States such
as his native Arizona, plus the all-
important pivotal “big five” States of
California, Texas, Illinois, Indiana and
Ohio. Winning ten solid south and
border States would give Goldwater 103
electoral votes as a starter. The big
five would add 121 more, leaving but
forty-six more to be picked up in his
native south-west and west, plus such
rock-ribbed Republican strongholds as
Vermont, New Hampshire in the east
and similar smaller States in the mid-
west.
This strategy entailed the virtual
writing off of the major States of New
York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan and
traditionally “eastern liberal” States with
deep Democratic Party traditions. But
as the campaign moved to its climax in
the voting booths, it appeared that the
Goldwater strategy would fall far short,
in fact disastrously short, of its goals in
terms of electoral votes. The senator
from Arizona, it was forecast, might
receive as few as forty-seven electoral
votes —all from the Deep South. This
would represent less than 10 per cent
of the total electoral votes of 538, and
thus prove more of a disaster than his
indicated share of the popular vote,
which probably would not fall much
below 40 per cent. This would amount
to the greatest electoral windfall for
Johnson since Franklin Roosevelt won
them all except six—representing Maine
and Vermont—in 1936.
Regardless of the extent of the ex-
pected Johnson win at the polls, it
seemed clear that the fact of his win-
ning would be anticipated on election
night long before it was actually
achieved. News media and television
networks had the latest model compu-
ters, electronic voting analysers and
similar gadgets installed, ready to pounce
on the earliest returns from eastern
States, which would go to the polls first,
swallow them and disgorge “projected”
results. If the anticipated landslide
occurred, it would certainly be fore-
shadowed in the very early returns and
might even produce forecasts of victory
before the polling booths in New York
closed at nine o’clock, (11 a.m. Wednes-
day, Sydney time) and hours before
California counted its votes.
It is beyond doubt that this election
would be the most extensively covered
in history by all media of information.

(ABC, CBS, NBC) plus the two major
news services (Associated Press and
United Press International) had joined
forces and hired 170,000 people at a
cost of eight million dollars to gather the
raw material, in the form of balloting
results, to feed into computers which
would extrapolate the results to a waiting
world. The most important information
to be fed the computers would come
from the ten States where polls close
early and from which the anticipated
Johnson victory would be predicted.
These key states, with their latest poli-
tical attitudes:
• South Carolina: A deep-south
State which Goldwater must have but
where Negro registration had increased
150 per cent over 1960, an ominous
indication for Goldwater. If Johnson
wins the State by a wide margin, he
could sweep the south.

® Florida: Eisenhower and Nixon
both won this southern State, which has
a high percentage of retired northern resi-
dents. Johnson can lose it but Gold-
water must win it.
• Kentucky: A traditional “border ’
State carried by the Republicans in the
last two elections. Johnson is slightly
favored but if his victory is large it
would indicate the way the other M-der
States were going.
• Indiana: This is one of Gold-
water’s critical “pivotal” States and one
where he has the biggest chance, because
of the white backlash sentiment in indus-
trial centres. If he loses it, he is in
trouble.
• Illinois: Another pivotal Gold-
water State, with white backlash pro-
minent in Chicago but with much John-
son strength because of the Democratic
political machine.
• Maryland: Another border State
where the racial issue is paramount and
where Governor Wallace of Alabama
received a large vote for the Presidency
in the Democratic primaries. However,
this is also the Washington “bedroom”
area where Johnson has much strength
among Federal employees.
• Connecticut: One of the first States
to report, went for Kennedy in 1960
and may give Johnson a big plurality.
O Ohio: Another pivotal State for
Goldwater. It has strong Republican
organisation and went solidly for Nixon
in 1960. If Johnson wins it, Gold-
water’s fate is probably sealed.
The homosexual bandwagon
campaign will go down in history
for various reasons, not the least of
them, the depths to which the desperate
Right-wing followers of the Republican
candidate descended as their hopes of
victory sank. In fact the moral tone of
the campaign went down in direct pro-
portion to these prospects. In the last
frantic days some of the Goldwaterites
hammered away at alleged homosexu-
ality in high places in Washington—
based on the arrest of Walter Jenkins,
a close personal aide of the President,
on a charge of perverted conduct. They
imputed “treason” to the President—
this with the apparent approval of Gold-
water himself—for his allegedly soft-on-
Communism attitudes. They produced
a campaign film—accusing the Demo-
crats of immoral practices—which Gold-
water himself was forced to junk.
On the other hand, President Johnson,
as he grew more confident of victory,
could afford to raise the tone of his
speeches correspondingly. At the end
he was waxing philosophical, talking to
the large and friendly crowds more like
a Billy Graham than a Texas politician,
recalling the country’s glorious past and
urging them on to good works and a
vision to the “good society” lying ahead
—in a Democratic administration, of
course. In that good society, he pro-
mised, there would be no more poverty,
no more crime and unlimited educa-
tional opportunities for all. The Presi-
dent, exuding goodwill and unbounded
optimism, particularly over the Novem-
ber 3rd results, was soaring high above
the battle as it reached its conclusion.

Goldwater
Post-mortem
At last , an opposition?
By JOHN DOS PASSOS
(Author of “USA”)
No matter who wins on November 3,
is is very much to be hoped that
the men and women who are devot-
ing so much to the Goldwater campaign
wili not go home and forget it. Even if
Goldwater loses, he will already have
won a major political victory. His capture
of the machinery of the Republican Party
means that for the first time in many
years, the basis exists in American poli-
tics for a really effective opposition.
The mouthpieces of the established
order shout to high heaven that the
Goldwater campaign is a flash in the
pan. The Liberal columnists make a
great show of bewailing the demise of
the Republican Party. What they are
hoping for, of course, is that once this
campaign’s over no one will dare raise
a dissident voice again. There’s an ex-
cellent chance that these hopes will be
dashed. In spite of hell and high water
the Presidential campaign of 1964 may
well prove to be the beginning of a
consistent application of the force of
minority opinion to the power structure
in Washington.
If it does nothing else, Barry Gold-
water’s capture of the Republican nom-
ination has proved that dissent exists on
a large enough scale to be politically
effective. The enormity of his crime, in
the eyes of the diverse vested interests
of the powers that be, is that he has
had the courage to dramatise the dis-
sent.
Win or lose in November, the most
important part of the contest has only
begun for the conservatives. Ever since
Franklin D. Roosevelt inaugurated our
peculiar American form of Caesarism
with the policy of “Tax, tax, spend,
spend, elect, elect,” there has been no
really consistent political opposition in
this country. Voices have been raised
in remonstrance against this or that
policy. But these were voices crying in the
wilderness. They lacked the sort of sup-
port Senator Goldwater has been able
to evoke: the young people carrying the
word from house to house, organising
rallies, distributing literature, seeing that
voters get to the polls, who are creating
a new type of political pressure group.
It is a startling fact that during all
the years since President Roosevelt’s
death, the most dedicated and continuing
political movement in this country has

been in the hands of the Communists.
In spite of their small numbers, and the
drawback of the visible failure of the
various Communist governments around
the world to produce a livable regime
for their victims, their propaganda has
remained the dominant influence dur-
ing the past twenty years. It will take all
the energy the young conservatives of
America can muster to effectively
counteract it.
It is highly probable that enough con-
servatives will' have seats in the next
Congress to form, if they roughly co-
ordinate their plan of action, a minority
strong enough to be listened to. Courage
and brains will tell in the end. Remem-
ber the immense influence the Irish
MPs had in the British parliament dur-
ing the years of agitation for Irish in-
dependence.
The first consideration must be of
ways and means to restore purpose and
common sense to the foreign policy of
the United States.
The bankruptcy of the policies of the
State Department has been made pain-
fully evident by the tragedy of Vietnam,
the Congolese fiasco and the paralysis
of the United Nations. The American
people and particularly Washington
officials must be made to understand
that these disasters are no accident.
They are the result of a long train of
mistakes dating back to Franklin Roose-
velt’s deluded notion that it was good
policy to help the Communists strip
the European powers of their colonies.
In these twenty years our foreign
policy can boast, on the credit side, of
the restoration of Germany and Japan,
and of the temporary return to sanity
under Truman's Administration which
resulted in the Marshall Plan and the
rescue of Greece and Turkey. The rest
of the story has been (with a few ex-
ceptions under Eisenhower and Dulles)
of practical collaboration, under a
smokescreen of anti-Communist pal-
aver, with the Communists to destroy
civilisation in a large part of the world.
Planning for 1966
T>ipartisanship in foreign policy has
** served as a cloak for innumerable
follies and crimes. Had there been the
sort of conservative opposition that now
seems possible the protests of the con-
scientious and well-informed men of
both parties who have spoken out in
remonstrance might have resulted in the
curbing of some of the worst excesses
of the Liberals in office.
On the domestic scene the decisions
which would have to be made by a con-
servative opposition are less urgent, but
the problems are more complicated. For
the purposes of a Presidential campaign,
where everything has to be either black
or white, it may be all right to talk
about restoring free enterprise, but for
practical purposes it will be necessary
to spell out just exactly what that
means. As things stand today it is the
mixed economies that are the going
concerns. Pure free enterprise, un-
trammelled by government controls or
unassisted by government handouts, just
does not exist in the world.
A very instructive investigation
might be conducted by some future
congressional committee to discover
what proportion of the criminal inepti-
tude in Vietnam resulted from bureau-
cratic stagnation in the Pentagon and
the CIA and the State Department, and
what proportion resulted from mistaken
policies of the top command.
The tasks laid out for a conservative
opposition in this country are stagger-
ing to contemplate. With the campaign
of 1964 rolling into history the time
has come to plan for 1966.

A Case
for the
Death Penalty
By GORDON HAWKINS
(Lecturer in Criminology,
University of Sydney.)
“Ts there anything new that can be said
A for or against capital punishment?”
The rhetorical question was posed three
years ago by Professor Sydney Hook in
an address to the New York State Dis-
trict - Attorneys’ Association. Certainly
nothing new has emerged from the some-
what desultory public discussion pro-
voked by the hanging of Eric Edgar
Cooke in Fremantle Gaol last week.
But even the far more intense debate
which arose over the Tait case in 1962
produced, as Creighton Burns noted in
his book on the subject, “no new evi-
dence and no new arguments”. Burns
did say, however, that at that time “the
abolitionists won on the weight of num-
bers of letters to the Press, public state-
ments and newspaper editorials”.
As a matter of fact, they usually do
win, not only in terms of avoirdupois
but also by way of weight of argument.
Any student of the subject must be
struck by the paucity of reasoned argu-
ment for the death penalty. And
although a number of Societies for the
Abolition of Capital Punishment exist,
there are no Societies for the Retention
or Restoration of Capital Punishment.
Yet this is not really very surprising.
For one thing, retentionists in any field
rarely feel the need to agitate on behalf
of the status quo. It should not there-
fore be assumed that they necessarily
have a weak case; or, in this context, that
the supporters of the death penalty are,
as is often implied, all ignorant, ill-
informed, emotional or merely sadistic.
It is true that the defence of capital
punishment is largely left to people like
J. Edgar Hoover whose idea of argu-
ment is well exemplified in the following
passage. “Words and words and words
may be written, but no plea in favor of
the death penalty can be more horribly
eloquent than the sight of the battered,
sexually assaulted body of this child ...”
But there are exceptions.
Two notable examples are the address
by Sydney Hook cited above which was
later published in “The New York Law
Forum” (August, 1961), and an article
entitled “In Favor of Capital Punish-
ment” by Jacques Barzun, who is Dean
of Faculties and Provost of Columbia
University, which appeared in “The
American Scholar” (Spring, 1962). As
neither of these journals is easily acces-
sible to, or widely read by, the general
public here, some of the points they
make are worth summarising briefly.
Both of them question the abolitionist
assumption that sentence of life impri-
sonment is more humane than a death
sentence, and suggest that abolitionists
are wrong in believing that they are
advocating a lesser penalty. Now it is
certainly true that abolitionists tend to
avoid discussion of those cases where
the only possible alternative to the death
penalty would be imprisonment for life
with release absolutely interdicted. “They
speak of the sanctity of life” says Bar-
zun, “but have no concern with its
quality”; and he is astonished that any-
one should welcome the possibility of
“a hundred more human beings . . .
kept alive in degrading conditions to
face a hopeless future.” In this con-
nection it is notable that the English
Lord Chief Justice, Lord Parker, in the
1961 Official Secrets Act trial said it
was against the spirit of the English Law
that a man should receive such a long
sentence that it would appear likely that
he might die in prison. Yet the aboli-
tionists are in effect suggesting, in many
cases of men too dangerous to be re-
leased, sentences involving not merely a
likelihood but a certainty of such an
outcome. It is an odd sort of benevo-
lence which would condemn anyone to
the endless humiliation, monotony, pro-
miscuity and frustration of permanent
detention in prison. Moreover, life im-
prisonment may inflict just as much
suffering (who can calculate?) on rela-
tives as the death penalty; and may
prevent a murderer's wife from re-
marrying and starting a new life. In
short, it is by no means obvious that the
death penalty is less humane than life
imprisonment. Indeed Hook goes so
far as to argue that we should permit
any criminal defendant sentenced to life
imprisonment, the right to choose the
death sentence instead.
Then there is the customary invoca-
tion of the sanctity of human life. The
question here is: is this really any more
than an ill-considered slogan? As Bar-
zun puts it: “Most of the abolitionists
belong to nations that spend half their
annual incomes on weapons of war and
that honor research to perfect means of
killing”. Moreover, unless we intend
(and no abolitionist advocates this) to
keep all murderers permanently incar-
cerated, some of them will eventually be
released. But, because of our ignorance
about psychopathology and our inability
to make accurate prognoses, release
(after a period of “good behavior” inside
prison) will, in the future as in the past,
sometimes result in further murders.
And here those who talk about the sanc-
tity of life seem curiously blind to the
situation of those human beings doomed
to be victims.
The second time i
T astly there is the matter, which Hook
raises, of those who having been
sentenced once to prison for premedita-
ted murder, murder again. Although
Hook does not refer to it, this has spe-
cial relevance to the prison situation.
For with the death penalty abolished we
are left without any effective sanction
at all in cases where a man already
serving a life sentence kills one of the
prison staff or a fellow prisoner. It
may be true that such cases are rare
but they could become less rare if all
murderers were kept alive. Certainly
there are no grounds for saying that
there do not exist murderers who know-
ing that they cannot be executed will not
hesitate to kill again. And Hook's sug-
gestion that in such cases the court
should have discretionary power to pass
the death sentence, if the criminal is
found guilty of a second murder, cannot
be dismissed as merely vengeful.
Of course not all these arguments are
entirely novel, yet they are commonly
ignored by abolitionists. There remains,
however, a further argument for the
death penalty which is ignored, although
not explicitly repudiated, by both Hook
and Barzun. Hook states that “the
argument from deterrence is inconclusive
and inconsistent”. Barzun says categori-
cally that he believes that “capital
punishment does not deter”.
Now the truth of the matter is this.
It is worth remembering that the evi-
dence regarding the effectiveness of capi-
tal punishment has for the most part
been assembled by those who wish to
abolish the death penalty with the object
of disproving the deterrent value claimed
for that punishment. Yet despite this
and despite the fact that the statistics
have been collected and surveyed very
thoroughly no positive conclusion has

‘good-water’ town
Think about water . . . our cheapest and scarcest commodity!
How urgent is the problem of water for the continued expansion
of our towns . . . how real is the threat of thirst?
These are questions for every Australian in all the towns
across the land, because with water, well managed, a town
can flourish; without it a limit is placed on the future.
There are two reasons for the “water problem,” apart from
the fundamental factor of Australia’s limited water resources.
One is our rapidly expanding population which is estimated
to double itself within thirty years. The other is the increasing
Capacity of everyone to use (and waste) more water. For
example, the average daily per capita consumption of water
in urban areas is around 90 gals. Ten years ago it was 81.
Improved living standards mean more water-hungry appliances,
extra bathrooms, a second car to wash. Aesthetic progress
emphasises parks and gardens ... we are becoming thirstier
communities, q
Today, in many towns, thoughtful people are asking whether
there is a future for the “new-blood”—the local crop of
youngsters ready to contribute their strength, skill and
enthusiasm to community expansion—or will they move on
to greener fields? Farsighted communities, making sure of
future employment potential, are looking to local industry,
tourism and intensive agriculture. But one thing is certain—
the essential ingredient of each of these is adequate water
availability.
At Hardies, we are ready to place the resources of our produc-
tion, technical and research facilities behind expansion in your
community. Attention to your water extension requirements is
provided at a personal level by our experienced representatives.
Their assignment for you includes on-the-spot engineering detail

personal attention is backed by Hardie’s forty years’ experience

Not as indigestible as it sounds!
Your after-dinner portion of “blue
vein” cheese owes its delicious
flavour and distinctive bouquet
to COPPER! Copper wires
strategically inserted in the
cheese while curing produce the
results so much beloved by
gourmets and others.
Copper of course goes into places
considered more important by all
except perhaps the gourmet!
Statistics tell us there’s a copper
consumption of 15 lb. a head of
Australia’s population. Over half
of this goes to various branches
of the electrical industry
communications, electronics,
light, power and household
appliances. About one-sixth is
used by the building industry
to make everything from water
pipes to door hinges. Road and
rail transportation accounts for
another twelve per cent, while
one-tenth is taken by industry
to make machine tools and equip-
ment and to alloy other metals.
A further six per cent is absorbed
by defence requirements and the
balance is used in a host of
ways, including the manufacture
of fertilisers and a wide range
of domestic needs including lip-
stick holders and light fittings.
This matchless versatility of
copper and copper alloys, with
their special significance in the
electronic era, makes them a
vital factor in Australia’s future.
If you would like to know more
about their potential for your
industry, ring, write or call.

been reached. The UK Royal Com-
mission on Capital Punishment (1949-
1953) reported after carefully consider-
ing expert evidence regarding all the
figures available for Europe, the Com-
monwealth and the USA that “the
figures afford no reliable evidence one
way or the other”. Many advocates of
abolition speak as though there is evi-
dence that the death penalty is not a
superior deterrent to imprisonment. This
is not the case. It is true that there is
no evidence that it is a superior deter-
rent. But that is not the end of the
matter.
Fevered phrases
■p\)R while we may amit that it is un-
A likely that there are anywhere a
great number of would-be murderers
straining at the leash waiting for the
abolition of capital punishment it should
be recognised that deterrence is not
merely a matter of intimidation.
We should not ignore the possibility
that the deterrent force of the death
penalty has operated by building up in
the community and maintaining over a
long period of time a general feeling of
abhorrence for murder. This is essen-
tially the point made almost exactly a
century ago by the great authority on
the criminal law, Sir James Fitzjames
Stephens. The fact that men are hanged
for murder is “one great reason” why
murder is considered so dreadful a
crime. And there seems no good reason
for doubting that the death penalty has
had some considerable influence in
creating and maintaining our present
moral attitude to murder.
I do not wish to suggest that the argu-
ments outlined above are absolutely
cogent or conclusive; merely that they
deserve consideration. Unfortunately
the argument on both sides has long
been dominated by emotion and senti-
mentality. Yet the issue is a serious
matter of public policy and it is import-
ant that it should be discussed rationally.
Glib journalistic rhetoric about the
“ghastly ritual” of hanging is no less
inimical to this than J. Edgar Hoover’s
fevered phrases about “criminal beasts”.

All Done with Mirrors
"The only great artists have been provincials ”
By HUGH CURNOW
66 teez!” said artist Andrew Sibley,
I between sips at his half-scotch,
“Of course I’m a Catholic.” He
brushed a brisk, blunt finger-tipped
hand through his shortish-cropped hair
and went on: “Yes, I was kicked out of
Port Moresby for fraternising with the
natives. That used to be illegal there.
It’s okay now. Yes, I am separated
from my teenage bride, as the popular
Press loves to put it. At least I don't
have to pose for pictures strumming a
guitar alongside her while she plays a
phony game of chess with herself. That’s
something, I suppose. Yes, I was kicked
out of Wallace Thornton’s art class at
the East Sydney Tech, after I called
him a ‘twit’. Now that I've read what
he’s had to say about me in ‘The Sydney
Morning Herald’ I reckon anyone would
wonder if he and Frank Cozzarelli of
‘The Sun’ saw the same exhibition.”
What SMH critic, Wallace Thornton,
said about Andrew Sibley, was that he
“has never had a clearly defined attitude
or expression in his art—at least not in
the continuing sense.” About the Sibley
exhibition of nudes and figures at the
Rudy Komon gallery Thornton added:
“All the artist does is expose his own
limitations—his own lack of knowledge
and experience.” What “The Sun” cri-
tic, Frank Cozzarelli wrote was: “The
oils and drawings are all unified and
finished in a sure, professional way. All
are expressionistic paintings done with a
gentle contortion rather than a violent
distortion,” (in sharp contrast to Thorn-
ton’s assessment of them as “a distortion
that slips and slides in aimless, loose,
decadent forms”).
Clearly, on the contradiction of art
critics, Sibley had a point. He is no less
lucid about what drives him to paint.
“Sex and religion. And a mirror. They’re
the main things. I think the mirror idea
is the one that really gets me going,
though. My next exhibition is going to
be all paintings of things seen in mirrors.
Let me tell you about the one painting
I want to do more than anything. I’ve
already tried to do it a dozen times but
I just can’t get it.
“One day I was on a bus from Bris-
bane to Toowoomba and it stopped at
some little place with a German name.
There was a milk-bar there and we all
went inside for a drink. There was this
long counter and behind it a shelf
full of milk-shake machines and milk-
shake containers and lollies and all that.
And there was this long mirror running
along the full length of the wall behind
it. In between it and us was this lovely
girl serving behind the counter. She
was really lovely to look at, with a beau-
tiful, sexy profile. But she always kept
that same profile turned towards us, no
matter what end of the counter she was
serving from or which way she was
leaning. I thought she’d get a kink in
her neck or something.
“Then I looked in the mirror behind
her. The other side of her face was
reflected there. It was completely
covered in a horrible, purple, mottled
birthmark. It looked grotesque. And,
do you know what, every single person
off that bus wasn't looking at her serving
the milkshakes—they were all looking at
her in the mirror. There were these two
men in particular. They couldn’t take
their eyes off that mirror. I could see
them and see the way they were looking
—as if they thought she might be all
right to take to bed provided she kept
her face turned the other way. And I
could see her, pretending she didn’t know
the mirror was there. And I could also
see out through an open door where
there was one of those Queensland
churches on stilts with a wooden cross
on top. I don't care if I never do any-
thing else. I must paint that picture.”
Born in 1933 in Sydney, Sibley left
school at 1 6i and went to the East
Sydney Technical College to study art,
briefly. Then in ’53 he left for London
where he remained until ’57, sharing a
flat with the current English “pop” artist,
Peter Blake. “The kitchen sink artists
were the big vogue then. If there’s one
thing I’ve declared war on in Australian
art it’s the new fad for blind aping of
international abstractism. It’s meaning-
less. The only great artists have been
provincial artists: people who paint about
what they know—not what other artists
pretend to know.”
leaving London, Sibley worked
in New Guinea as a plants clerk for
the Works Department. “What I like to
remember best about my Port Moresby
days was that I was the first white man
ever to brief a white lawyer to appear
for a native in a magistrate's court and
get him acquitted. What was the native
charged with? Soliciting black girls—•
for me.”
From New Guinea, Sibley went to
Brisbane where I first met him, in ’62.
He was stretched naked and unconscious
under a blanket on a mattress on
the floor of what then passed for the
nearest thing to an artist’s garret in Bris-
bane: a tenement house in Petrie Terrace.
An interview had been arranged for
10 a.m. I found, when he awoke,
that Sibley liked to list the evils
of art-gallery owners in Australia. “I
still think most of them are green-
grocers,” he told me a few days ago.
“Rudy Komon is one of the few who
really care about an artist enough to
keep him going. He pays me £2O a
week just to exist—not to paint. I

paint when I can. And that hasn’t been
very often lately.”
The main interruption to his extraordi-
nary capacity for work, since he painted
380 pictures in 365 days during 1962
(and sold the lot) has been what he des-
cribes as “a severe nervous breakdown”.
He says it happened at the same time
as his separation from his wife, the for-
mer Andrea Gibson, of Brisbane. “I
married Andrea when she was 18. Now
she’s 19. She’ll get over it. I think I
have now. But it was hell at the time.
I went blind. The doctors said it was a
severe nervous reaction. Whatever it
was I just couldn’t see. I even lost the
sense of feeling from my mouth. Then
I collapsed in the street and they put
me into St Vincent's. I've been out of
hospital for two months now and I've
been trying to paint with only the basic
building-blocks of whatever talent I have.
A state of grace
Qibley does not claim he has been
creating beauty by this form of self-
stripping. “But I have created. It is
the closest any artist can get to God, that
moment when he stands in front of an
empty canvas. Right there he is about
to create. The minute he begins to imi-
tate or conform with fashion he loses
whatever godliness his art had. I want
to create life as I think it can be—or
ought to be—in a state of grace (and I
don't mean a religious, Catholic state
of grace). People with real grace can
transcend anything.”
The first Sibley picture sold went to
actor, Michael Pate, for 20gns and was
entitled “Parisian Landscape”. The
most recent Sibley, entitled “Indecision”,
went for 275gns. “It’s worth it because
it's a much better painting. I don’t
believe in sky-rocketing my prices just
to see how much people will pay,” Sib-
ley says.
Represented at the Whitechapel and
Tate Galleries in London, his paintings
—large, glowing, brooding things—are
currently also included in an exhibition
of Australian Art Today now travelling
Europe.
Meanwhile he has taken over painting
and drawing classes at the Mary White
School in Sydney. Sharing a rented Pad-
dington house with a folk-singing friend,
Sibley hopes to help make the School
everything he says the East Sydney Tech,
isn’t. “No artist must ’graduate’ in a
mould that has that school stamped all
over it. Unless we can produce disci-
plined individuals we’re failures,” he
said, leaving to meet a friend whom, he
said, had “conned” a very rich widow
into marriage and was now celebrating
the delivery of his wedding present
a Cadillac convertible. “And she’s a bit
of a con-man, too. You see? It’s all done
with mirrors,” he added as he left.

Hell and Glory
The concert evaporates,
the criticism remains
By S. SMYTHE
“ A singer has to be very careful about
his voice,” French baritone Gerard
Souzay told me at his hotel in Sydney.
Therefore he cannot be social; which is
too bad I would love to be social! To
be a singer means really to live for the
career, and it means a lot of sacrifices
when it comes to friendships and social
activities.” He stopped. “If you ask an
athlete who is preparing a performance,
you will find the the same.”
I asked him was there a difference be-
tween the relationship of an instrumental-
ist with his audience, and of a singer with
his? “Yes,” he said at once. “Facing the
public is the difference. The pianist, for
instance, is in profile; his mind con-
fronts the public, but not his face. I am
looking at the faces. I generally see the
people. Often I catch a face which seems
to be more impressed, more sensitive,
and sometimes really I sing for one
person, though without appearing to do
so.” Then he said, “You are your own
instrument, which is at the same time
glorious and hell.”
Souzay talking of music is a man in
whom there seems to be not a spark of
vanity. In his thoughtful, attentive way
he said, “It seems to me very extra-
ordinary that the repertoire I am lucky
to sing is not popular with the big pub-
lic. It is so easy to fill a hall with a big
pianist, and so difficult to fill it with an
interesting singer.”
He frowned over music criticism. He
was speaking not for himself but in gen-
eral. ‘‘There are two ways of criticising
an artist,” he said drily. “If you take
Maria Callas, for instance, you are right
if you say, ‘Madame Callas is a great
artist, but she has such and such faults.’
You will be right, also, if you say, ‘Ma-
dame Callas has such and such faults, but
she is such a great artist, never mind
the faults!” You can put emphasis on
the faults, or the qualities.
“You see,” he said, “an artist works
sometimes years on a programme, and
a critic writes his review in ten minutes;
and he is the winner, because the con-
cert has evaporated and the criticism
remains. Will you think of that?”

R.M. Abst. Holds 15 p.c. Div.
The fourth annual general meeting
of Ready Mixed Abstract Ltd
was held on Monday at the
Pollock Galleries, East Sydney. The
chairman and managing director, Mr
Nigel Conning, delivered the following
address to shareholders:
Ladies and gentlemen, —lt gives
me great pleasure to report another
successful year's operations. General
business conditions, as you know, were
sluggish, and some old-established art
firms were in difficulties, particularly
in the gumtree sector of the industry.
But the forward-looking policy of
Ready Mixed Abstract has been re-
warded by increasing sales, which
have enabled us to maintain the divi-
dend rate of 15 per cent. Moreover,
employees of the company won several
important competitions, including the
Cleopatra Cosmetics Prize, the United
Banks Sculpture Award, and the
Savonarola Scholarship for Religious
Art.
This excellent record was due in
part to the fine work of our public
relations branch. Its members have
been tireless in their ef-
forts to make leading
citizens abstract-minded.
They were able to widen
their social activities as
a result of bulk purchas-
ing of gin and sherry,
and have built up an im-
pressive stock of goodwill
towards the company’s
products.
During the year we
also received splendid support from
the critics. Some of them are share-
holders in the company, and it gives
me much satisfaction to see them here
today. If it were not for the labors of
these devoted men, the wider public
would be unable to appreciate the dy-
namic ambivalence, the subjective
iconography, and the committed lyric-
ism which are the hallmarks of Ready
Mixed Abstract work.
Religious division
4 striking feature of the year was
'*"*■ the rapid expansion of our Religious
Division. To meet a rush of orders,
we were compelled to relax the quali-
fications for staff recruitment. A
young man with no religious back-
ground other than a Sunday School
picnic has become one of the Divi-
sion’s most popular painters. Our PR
branch is now engaged in breaking
down the resistance in certain Church
circles to Ready Mixed Abstract pro-
ducts.
Another encouraging development
is the growth of our Garbage Assem-
blage Division. Consumer reaction to
the latest assemblages was very favor-
able. Accordingly, the company has
obtained exclusive search rights over
six municipal tips.
The size of paintings showed a
satisfactory increase during the year
in all divisions. Pictures of 20 square
feet and more are not uncommon to-
day. As a result of these buoyant
conditions our wholly owned subsidi-
ary, Durablot Canvas Pty Ltd, sub-
stantially raised its net profits.
Takeover move
T now find it necessary to touch on
a less agreeable subject. I refer to
the manoeuvres by the United Paint
Corporation to effect a “takeover” of
the company. Your directors strongly
urge you to hold on to your shares.
The present Board has done a splendid
job for the company, and you can
show your faith in the
future of Ready Mixed
Abstract by refusing to
sell your holdings, at
least until we have
jacked up the price.
A regrettable episode
was the defection of
some members of our
painting staff. Although
enjoying excellent pay
and working conditions,
these artists saw fit to leave us and
sign contracts with rival galleries.
Steps have been taken to ensure that
this will not happen again. I need not
emphasise that we at Ready Mixed
Abstract place a high value on loyalty.
During the year I was able to make
another extensive tour of world art
centres. The value of these annual
visits, I feel, is very great.
Current overseas trends such as figura-
tive painting and pop art, are being
watched closely by your directors. We
are ready to open a Division of Pop
Art as soon as it becomes sufficiently
pop. Shareholders can face the com-
ing year, I believe, with confidence
that Ready Mixed Abstract will live
up to its old motto, Muros operimus—
“You show us the wall, we fill it”.

Overgrown Kids At Play
The Olympic tradition of larrikinism
By JACK POLLARD
I>ehavior of the Australian represen-
** tatives at the Tokyo Olympic Games
conformed closely to the pattern estab-
lished in the four previous postwar
Olympics at London, Helsinki, Mel-
bourne and Rome. The key to it all
seems to be that there is no reveller
quite so dedicated as an Olympian sud-
denly released from months, even years,
of strenuous training in a celebrating
foreign capital.
Every four years since 1948 the plot
has been fairly well standardised: a few
irresponsibles, especially those eliminated
early in the Games fortnight, decline
from party-going to vandalism while
awaiting the 'plane home. They uphold
the Australian tradition of souveniring
Olympic flags and commit various feats
of larrikinism, ranging from sorties into
the billets of the opposite sex to pilfer-
ing items that may impress Mum and
Dad or the girlfriend back home. They
distract athletes still striving desperately
hard to win medals and they take a beer
or two too many, which, after years of
abstinence in the long build-up towards
Games perfection, sometimes converts
them into rip-roaring drunks.
The work of the team officials and
administrators in retaining discipline
and decorum becomes harder as the
Games progress. Sooner or later a Press-
man, who knows his paper likes this type
of stuff, blows the gaff on the few hot-
heads having a ball. Then they all come
home, and the majority, naturally
enough, deny the allegations of hooligan-
ism. This time round walker Noel Free-
man and swimmer Dawn Fraser have
been particularly forthright in defend-
ing the well-behaved hard core.
At the 1948 London Games team
manager Edgar Tanner had more than
one fiery interview defending Australia’s
honor before officials of the Olympic
Village after water polo players pinched
an Olympic flag.
Four years later the Australian
Olympic team manager, Mr Bill Uren,
mindful of the potential dangers in the
practice, warned Olympians about to
visit Buckingham Palace against souven-
iring Palace teaspoons. Mr Uren said he
delivered his warning jocularly, but his
intent was clear enough. A few serious-
minded team members who did not
appreciate Mr Uren’s sense of humor
blabbed to Pressmen that he had treated
them as “irresponsibles”.
Mr Uren also warned the team
against giving away their Palace invita-
tions. This, too, upset the serious-minded
who considered it implied that they were
willing to blackmarket the invitations.
In fact, one or two had tried.
Throughout those 1952 Helsinki
Games the Olympic Village was a hot-
bed of stories about souveniring raids
by athletes in a holiday mood after be-
ing eliminated from their events. But
far-seeing Finnish organisers prevented
trouble by having hundreds of Olympic
flags made. By now it had become the
fashion to describe the stealing of flags
or other fittings as “souveniring”.
The Melbourne Games in 1956 pro-
vided a comparatively dull period in the
“souveniring” dodge. Apparently there
is not quite the same thrill in it on your
home soil as in foreign parts.
But Rome in 1960 saw the whole
familiar pattern fully restored, with
accusations of flag stealing breaking out
as our athletes went into the let-down
period. A year or so later it emerged
that there had been at least one good
brawl between fellow Australian com-
petitors.
The strange thing is that when the
outbreaks of vandalism occur towards
the end of the Olympics, the Australian
at home blames the no-hopers in our
team, the men and women who failed
to show Olympic excellence. There is
inevitably an outcry that the no-hopers
should never be sent away and the claim
is put that larrikinism would stop if only
“I'm afraid, I'm afraid of Virginia Woolf!"
potential medal-winners were sent to the
Games.
In fact, the big names have shown an
aptitude for misbehavior during their
revelry, matching that of the also-rans,
although there is a lingering hint of
beach hooliganism in the behavior of
most miscreants.
To deny the apparent outsider a
chance to compete would be to spurn
one of the great dramas of any sporting
event the spectacle of the unknown,
unsung competitor defeating the highly
publicised world-record holder. At every
Olympics quite a few alleged no-hopers
go home with medals. Australia's hockey
players and basketballers thrilled in
Tokyo with their plucky displays, but
nobody gave them much chance of the
successes they achieved in the weeks be-
for the Games. Bill Northam would
have been left at home to package baby
powder and debate with Sydney Council
aldermen if we had listened to those
who claimed they knew medal-winning
material when they saw it.
Most veteran Olympic reporters say
there is a need for a more mature
appraisal of the behavior of a few idiots.
We could start by forgetting the old
chestnut that these Olympic pranks dam-
age our reputation overseas. The truth
is that overseas countries many of
whose inhabitants think Australia is
part of Austria are singularly un-
concerned by it all.
At the Melbourne Olympics an Aus-
tralian sportswriter proudly informed
the fine American sports columnist Red
Smith that he had just sent a grisly
account of Olympic Village thievery to
his paper. Smith looked at the Australian,
as if unable to believe anyone would
take this approach. “Say, guy,” he said,
“don't you realise that at heart they are
all just overgrown kids at play?”

Why did Hanimex add
that ‘F’ to Praktica IV?
For Fresnal, firstly.
That’s the name of the optical genius responsible for
the latest modifications to Praktica. The same sort of
genius that has developed German automobiles to their
present stage of perfection. Mr. ‘F’ has invented a
new kind of grooved screen view-finder. When you use
it, you’ll see how it concentrates all of the available
light to give a much brighter, sharper picture.
We could have called it a IVFF, actually, because we’ve
also added a new fingertip controlled split-image
range-finder.
This gives the Praktica IVF two new features:
(1) Fresnal screen view-finder.
(2) Fingertip controlled split-image range-finder.
Add these to the excellence of the Praktica IV and to
its fully automatic lenses, its most flexible range of
accessories, its fantastic Hanimex world-wide warranty,
and the finest of service ... and this justly famous
35 mm. camera is worth more than an initial ‘F.’
The Praktica is a single lens reflex camera with fully
interchangeable lenses. Praktica offers these features
at only a little more cost than simple range-finder
cameras.
Here are the three models:
Praktica IVF with Meyer Domiplan Lens.
This quality f2.8/50 mm. 4-element automatic lens is
hard coated and colour corrected. The automatic dia-
phragm opens and closes as the shutter is released
and the film transported to the next frame. Price . . .
£39/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Tessar Lens.
This famous f2.8/50 mm. lens is fitted with a depth of
field preview button and fully automatic diaphragm.
Price . . . £49/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Pancolor Lens.
This 6-element f2/58 mm. lens is the finest of its type
in the world—has every modern optical innovation
incorporated, to give the maximum results under all
light conditions. Price . . . £59/19/6.
Praktica offers you the largest range of interchangeable
lenses and accessories in the world. It’s worth a fast
trip to your friendly photographic dealer, who will tell
you a lot more about Praktica and demonstrate every
outstanding feature.
Or, if you prefer, write Hanimex for free literature.
The highly informative handbook, "Praktica System of
Photography,” is also available from Hanimex dealers
at 39/6.

Private Bins
Tall stories?
By HUGH CURINOW
'T'he unfortunate thing is that it needed
to be said at all. But the Library
Association of Australia felt it necessary
last week to issue a statement entitled
“Principles On Freedom To Read”, if
only to make clear where it stands on
the subject of so-called dirty books.
Officialdom, in various shapes, having
reduced some ratepayers’ chances of
reading such unhygienically-labelled pub-
lications (“The Thin Red Line” and “The
Group” are two) obviously some state-
ment was necessary.
The librarians’ elected members of the
Library Association set out six points on
which they say they are unshiftable.
These defined a librarian’s responsibility
to “keep open channels of communica-
tion”, not exercise discrimination against
either authors or readers on grounds of
“race, sex, religion or political affilia-
tion”, and to promote interest in all con-
temporary issues “including those of a
controversial nature”. It stated also that
the selection of books for libraries is not
meant to be a form of censorship, and
that while the laws of the country re-
garding books must be observed, any
attempts by pressure groups to suppress
any books must be resisted.
The Association's spokesman, Mr
Allan Horton, told us that such pres-
sure groups were usually localised library
councils. “The things they seem to
object to most are four letter words and
books about sex abnormalities,” said
Mr Horton, who is the University of
New South Wales's librarian. He added
that his library has little trouble but
many other libraries throughout the
country need to be constantly on guard
against groups who try to have certain
books removed from shelves. “Some
librarians have compromised by keeping
‘hot’ books in a room at the back —a
sort of private bin—rather than on
shelves more easily perused,” he said.
Mr John Levett, librarian at the Lake
Macquarie Shire Library, told us he had
resisted this. “The only reason for
taking a book off the public shelves
should be that it is not being read.
Some books keep disappearing here, of
course. Marriage manuals are often
missing. But I always replace them.”
Another “compromise” practised in
many libraries, I learned, was for
“adult” books to be placed on the top
shelves. The idea is, it seems, that as
children grow up they also grow taller.
By the time they are old enough to read
certain books they also will be tall
enough to reach them. This could, of
course, see the emergence of a new
type of pressure group altogether—•
comprised entirely of short people.


Around Melbourne
The Moss Spreads in Spring Street
Tn Melbourne this week one com-
A mentator had a lovely idea for a
cartoon. He depicted Mr Boite as a
blousy female with the caption: “Non-
sense, there’s no such thing as a fate
worse than death.”
Alas, the cartoon idea did not get
past the censor. Back in the dream-
time of early September, Mr Bolte
said that if he lost the by-election for
the south-eastern province in the
Legislative Council there would be an
early election. He lost but there was
no election. In the meantime he was
conquered by that charming farmer,
Mr Moss.
Victorian politics must be fright-
fully puzzling to the interstate reader.
In the relative calm of such a place
as Canberra the Country Party and
the Liberals live together happily,
and even exchange portfolios. Not
here.
Once Labor scored in this by-
election we were back to the days of
yore. Labor and the Country Party
could combine in the Upper House
for a majority of one. Mr Stoneham
is the leader of the Labor Party and
Mr Moss is the CP leader. The in-
evitable remark had to be made, a
rolling Stoneham had gathered a
Moss.
Well, the Stoneham-Moss team
voted against supply in the Lower
House, then, come the following Tues-
day, Victoria waited with somewhat
mild fascination to see what would
happen in the Council. We had seen
it all 17 years before. On that
occasion the Liberals and the Coun-
try Party voted against supply. While
supply was being refused the public
servants went without pay for a week.
But actually the' members of the
Upper House didn’t have to wait,
they received their salaries under a
special appropriation. So the elec-
tion came, Labor lost half their seats
and the Liberals doubled theirs.
This Tuesday we waited right until
the bells were ringing until we knew
whether or not Mr Moss would re-
ject supply. The newspapers carried
thrilling accounts of secret conclaves
that were being held all over the great
building; even a remarkable story
that, incredibly, Mr Moss had dis-
appeared.
Late in the afternoon it was clear
that Mr Bolte had surrendered utterly
and the Government was saved. These
were the terms: He would cut recent
rises in periodical rail tickets, consider
off-peak fares for all public transport,
drop the words “and Country” from
the title of Bolte’s “Liberal and Coun-
try Party”, rail freight increases not
to apply to approved decentralised in-
dustries. Then the LCP and CP were
to consult on “a fair electoral redis-
tribution in the Legislative Assembly”.
Tactfully, the surrender terms did
not explain whether Mr Moss meant
fair Liberal or fair Country. As it is,
not one-twelfth of the voters elect
nearly one-sixth of the Legislative
Assembly, and almost a quarter of the
Legislative Council. If Bolte went
ahead with his original ideas for a
fair distribution the old Country
Party problem would be over, because
the CP would barely exist.
To really understand the true
mystery of Victorian politics it is
necessary to go into history. In the
old days the cartoonists had a stan-
dard cartoon. It depicted the Liberals,
Labor and Country Party buzzing
around in a revolving door. A former
editor of the Melbourne “Herald”,
Cecil Edwards, has done some re-
search on all this. He says that be-
tween 1921 and 1955 Victoria had 21
governments with an average life of
18 months. If you took out the 10
years in the late ’thirties and early
’forties when Sir Albert Dunstan, with
brilliant conniving, managed to stay in
office, the average life expectancy was
only a year.
Tt all began in 1921 after the down-
A fall of the Lawson Government,
and the CP had this marvellous corner
position. Although they had only 13
seats in the House their terms for
coalition with the nationalists was six
Cabinet seats.
In 1924 the Government changed
four times. By now, still with only 13
seats, the CP was demanding half the
seats in Cabinet. The Nationalists
wouldn’t play so Labor went in. Five
months later the Nationalists, like Mr
Bolte, were ready to submit, but now
the Country Party wanted ALL the
Cabinet seats, which they got. So for
the next 2i years they were in the
lovely position where practically every
member was a member of Cabinet.
For years all the parties took turns in
supporting each other but maybe the
most interesting battles took place be-
tween the end of 1947 and the mid-
’fifties. The era began when Tom
Hollway, the Liberal leader, and J. G.
B. McDonald (now Sir John McDon-
ald) the Country Party leader, parted
company. Just to quote you some of
the friendly CP to Liberal phrases on
that day. From Mr McDonald: “This
contemptible ratbag ... the prince
of appeasers and king of disruption-
ists . . . the most irresponsible Prem-
ier ever to have strutted across the
political arena.”
From Sir Albert Dunstan, CP: “This
worm-like Premier with the swollen
head and shrunken back. This pamp-
ered playboy . . . craven cur looking
in the mirror in the morning and
thinking himself savior of this coun-
try.”
From Hollway: “In the words of
my late leader Sir Stanley Argyle the
rogue is at his old tricks again. Every-
thing he touches politically he at-
tempts to destroy.”
And so the excitement built up.
The real thing was not so much to
run Victoria but to stay in office. At
one stage we had a superb collection
of parties and it was terribly embar-
rassing for the Serjeant-at-arms trying
to find rooms for all the leaders. There
were Liberals and the breakaway Lib-
erals, the Country Party and the
breakaway Country Party, Labor and
Independent Labor. It was in 1949
that we gave birth to the Liberal and
Country Party, a creation of the Lib-
erals and rebel CP members. Actu-
ally 1952 was a news year as fine as
1924—we scored four different Gov-
ernments. One lasted only two days.
In 1955 Henry Bolte took over with
supreme power for the Liberals in the
Lower House but he continued to
be embarrassed by Labor - Country
nuptials in the Upper. The June elec-
tions at last gave him the majority
of one in the Council and it seemed
steady Government had arrived after
30 years, only to be lost four months
later in the south-eastern province.
Now we are most intrigued to observe
just how much further the Moss will
spread over that building in Spring
Street.

Angkor Wat: Splendor and Decay
And the mystery of why these temples were built remains
By Sydney architect DOUGLAS SNELLING
Cxmbodia is on the way from no-
where to nowhere. Thousands of
people have flown across its flat
alluvial plains, not realising that under-
neath was Cambodia. For those same
flat plains extend endlessly across at least
three countries from the South China Sea
to the Gulf of Siam. One cannot acci-
dentally visit Cambodia on the way to
somewhere else. To visit the ruins of
Angkor Wat means a determined effort
—a veritable pilgrimage, for Angkor is
300 miles north of Phnom Penh, the
capital.
Among those interested in archaeology
and architectural history, great differ-
ences of opinion about Angkor Wat
occur; arguments as to date of origin,
who built these tremendous construc-
tions, and why they were suddenly left
to be eaten up by the jungle nearly a
thousand years ago. Give or take a few
centuries, certain facts are now generally
accepted and partially proven. Early
during French occupation in 1861, a
French naturalist, Henri Mouhot, de-
cided to continue a search for strange
insects north of any point yet explored
by Western man. Mouhot, like many
other Frenchmen, had heard vague
native accounts of ghostly objects buried
deep in the jungle.
With a party of natives, Mouhot came
upon a quarter-mile-wide river, five
miles north of Siem Reap, his native vil-
lage headquarters. His men cut their
way through the jungle to the water’s
edge and crossed the river in a dugout
canoe, pushing their way through reeds
and lotus blossoms, in stinking, searing
heat to the other bank. On the far
shore they waded in mud and hacked
and cleared to get a foothold. A short,
laborious distance from the river bank
Mouhot came across a 10-foot-high
stone wall, obviously man-made. He
scaled the wall and landed in more dense
jungle. After hours of cutting and
hacking, there ahead of him were stone
buildings hundreds of feet high. It
would be impossible to imagine what
went through Mouhot's mind at this
point, for it is just as impossible to set
down thoughts that come crowding in
today when one sees Angkor for the
Mr and Mrs Snelling recently spent
two months travelling by ’plane and
car in South-East Asia. Due to the
uncertainties of air transport to
Cambodia, they are among the few
Westerners to go there this year.
first time, and today it has been cleared
and opened up considerably. What
Mouhot thought to be a river was in
fact the quarter-of-a-mile-wide moat sur-
rounding the outer wall of Angkor, and
the jungle beyond the wall had once
been water gardens and terraces of im-
mense scale.
Some of the constructions date from
the mid-seventh century with alternative
forms of Buddhism and Hinduism as a
religious theme. It is thought that the
great Angkor Wat was built around
1100 AD, dedicated to the Hindu god
Vishnu, the towers symbolising the
legendary Mount Meru, site of the gods
and centre of the universe. The exterior
walls represent a chain of mountains at
the edge of the earth, and the surround-
ing moats the ocean.
Angkor Wat (Pagoda Town) is on the
grandest scale of anything in the world
today, and is perhaps second only to the
fabled Tower of Babel. The water gar-
den and gardens surpass Versailles; the
plazas are far grander than St Peter’s in
Rome; the towers have more impact than
the Pyramids. The towers are tre-
mendously beautiful, beehive shapes
nearly 300 feet high, built of dry laid
stones, each exceeding one ton in
weight. In spaciousness and splendor,
these structures are greater than Notre
Dame, Chartres Cathedral in France,
and all the great cathedrals of England,
such as Lincoln; neither Greece nor
Rome can boast of such immense
structures. Architecture, engineering
and canal building is on a larger scale
than anything in the world. The canals
are greater than those in Venice and
were not only water reticulation systems
but were navigable for hundreds of miles
and formed a major means of transpor-
tation.
And yet for what purpose were these
stone buildings constructed? Not as
tombs as the Pyramids, not as places of
assembly, for apart from the many long
galleries and narrow corridors, no room
is bigger than ten feet square. Func-
tionally, the buildings are as useless as
Stonehenge. Even the so-called “libra-
ries” are wasteful of space for they
are completely solid except for narrow
cross corridors.
Although engineering feats at Angkor
are quite remarkable, the builders knew
nothing of the arch. They used only
simple post and beam construction. In
their huge towers and over corridors
and rooms, complex forms of corbelling
were employed. Stone bridges were
built hundreds of miles from Angkor,
planned to give faster transportation for
their workers. Even there, though the
bridges span gorges hundreds of feet
wide, they are built using only compli-
cated column and corbel construction.
The spaces between columns oftentimes
were so small that under flood condi-
tions many bridges were washed out by
debris blocking all the openings. A few
such bridges remain to this day—some
fully macadamised —and carry all forms
of modern transportation.
It is almost certain that the stones
were laid in position as raw cubes, plan-
ned to give required overhangs where
deep carving was to occur. After erec-
tion the entire structure was completely
covered with scatfolding, enough to sup-
port thousands of stonemasons. How
such stones were raised to such heights
is still a mystery. But somehow this
must have been done with rice-stalk
ropes, leather thongs, manpower, and
elephants by the thousand. In this great
jungle no natural stone appears. Some
temples are built of hard grey sand-
stone, while others are delicate pink
sandstone. No quarries have been
found, so it must be assumed that the

stone was transported on rafts down
the Mekong River.
To approach Angkor Wat you pass
alongside a mile-long moat, across a
250-yard causeway over the moat to the
outer wall, and the main entrance gate,
some five storeys high. The outer wall,
half a mile square, is a continuous gal-
lery facing internally. Once through the
gateway, ahead lies another raised cause-
way 400 yards long. It is from this
gateway that one gets the first impact
of the scale of Angkor Wat. Already a
mile has been walked from the end of
the moat before we arrive at the main
galleries which surround the five central
towers. Here we are overawed again by
the magnificence of these quarter-mile-
long galleries, carved in bas relief, end
to end, each ten feet high. A long walk,
turn the corner, and another such gal-
lery, and so on around the building.
From these bas-reliefs a great deal of
information has been acquired. Each
gallery is split in the centre by an open-
ing leading to a further four hundred-
yard causeway to the base of the central
tower. On each side of this central
opening the bas-reliefs show stories of
great battles fought. In each, the centre-
piece shows the two opposing kings
meeting, either on elephants or, as in the
case of naval engagements, in large war
canoes. Behind each king the highest
rank warriors ride on elephants, then
come the horse troops, then the armies
on foot, followed by lines of bullock
cart supply wagons, and so on, right
back to normal village life, depicting all
the efforts made to support such an
army. At these extremities the day-to-
day occurrences in the villages are
vividly portrayed. It is interesting to see
carved on the walls the same all wooden,
wooden-sprung, bullock carts of one
thousand years ago, exactly as the ones
used to this day on the plains below
Angkor Wat, with not the slightest
change or addition.
The noise of hats’ wings
Tt is quite eerie inside these galleries.
A The hot, humid air seems suddenly
heavier, a peculiar smell of ammonia is
apparent, and one looks into dark cor-
ners almost fearfully. Then you realise
the presence of bats above, thousands
of them, filling all the black voids above
you with the noise of their wings. In-
side the floors are slippery with their
excretions. Quickly through here to the
other causeway and on to the base of the
main tower. Already we have crossed
some high thresholds, and up a few steep
steps, but here in front of us now is a
flight of steps as steep as a cliff, with
treads 6in. wide and risers 18in. high;
each flight is unbroken for 60 feet of
height. After negotiating two of these,
we arrive on the highest accessible point,
still only half way up the main tower —-
from here up nothing but solid stone.
It is anti-climax to reach this level, for
the central sanctuary is no more than a
small, dark cell ten feet square, contain-
ing a single statue of an eight-armed
Buddha.
Between the two World Wars and
right up to the end of French occupa-
tion, French archaeologists did a magni-
ficent job of clearing jungle from the
ruins. Fortunately, by some odd
chance many of the constructions were
spared by the jungle, but others were
completely wrecked by rain trees grow-
ing some two hundred feet high.
By mid-1920, plans of the ruins were
being drawn and plotted on maps. Here
the enormous scale became apparent.
A city plan emerged 50 miles in dia-
meter. All the constructions were
rectilinear, except one lone memorial to
a royal horse, fashioned in circular
form. Each rectangle was square to the
other, though miles apart, and each was
interconnected with canals to supply
water for the moats, irrigation and for
drinking. This area sustained a popula-
tion of some three million people.
About this time, the mid-19205, a small
odd-shaped lake close by was found to
be an overgrown man-made lake, cover-
ing a rectangle eight miles by two miles,
and what appeared to be a natural
mound of earth hundreds of feet high
with a temple, Phnom Bakheng, built
on top, was really the excavation
material from this main water storage
basin.
But more discoveries were to come,
and perhaps the most beautiful of all
the constructions. Between the two
World Wars an exploring party dis-
covered the Red Temples of Banteay
Srei (Citadel of Women—96o AD) 50
kilometres from the centre of the city
area. They were Hindu in origin, and
were built to the sole worship of the
Lingam, the Hindu symbol of creation.
Banteay Srei is so great a contrast to
Angkor Wat. It is ornate with “heaven-
ly dancers”, and certainly the change of
scale brings to mind femininity, as does
the delicate pink of the sandstone. Its
small central beehive tower contains a
room six feet square with a Lingam as its
focal piece. Within feet of the structure
are other delicate ornate small towers,
again called “libraries”. Perhaps this
is what they were—no one is quite sure.
Angkor Thom (Large Town), com-
pleted late 12th century, the city area
within a two-mile square moat, contains
the central religious structure, the
Bayon. Here are 54 towers, not as high
at Angkor Wat, but still tremendous.
Each tower has four faces of Buddha,
who casts his benevolence to the four
points of the compass. The 216 faces
of Buddha are each 15 feet high and
each capped with enormous lotus buds.
Here are the royal terraces, the elephant
terrace and the monkey terrace, each 300
yards long. From the top of these King
Jayavaraman VII, the builder of Angkor
Thom, reviewed his troops.
It is said that Jayavaraman VII
commanded an army of over a million
men, with 200,000 elephants trained for
war. He had a huge naval force of
arrow-proof boats, and machines for
firing arrows. An early Chinese visitor
said, “When he went to war the sun was
darkened by the dust of his armies of
elephants”. Though such major wars
were costly, they usually resulted in the
acquisition of hundreds of thousands of
slaves brought home in chains. By the
labor of these slaves the temples were
built—Angkor Wat was reckoned to
have been built by 50,000 men over a
period of 70 years.
No money for restoration
f|\)DAY the Cambodian Government
seems to act purely as a custodian
to the Angkor treasures. Little or no
money is available for further restoration
or clearing. Tourism is practically nil, and
as the country is now politically inde-
pendent, all outside money sources have
dried up. During French colonisation,
Bernard Groslier of the Ecole Francaise
d’Extreme Orient, a brilliant French
archaeologist, was put in charge of res-
toration work. Some 20 years ago, he
envisaged a magnificent, but extremely
expensive, method of restoration.
Possibly his plan was so far-reaching
and costly that —even had the politics of
this country run smoothly—no country
in the world could have marshalled the
financial resources to achieve his de-
sires. Perhaps it is better to control
the deterioration within reasonable
limits, rather than to completely rebuild
them —for something surely would be
lost in this effort, if only psychological.
The existing built-in atmosphere of this,
the world's greatest collection of ancient
buildings, may have been destroyed.
Why in the year 1432 did the entire
population leave the area to waste away
in the jungle? And why did they dis-
appear without trace? Were they war-
spent? Some authorities attribute this
as similar to the decadence that des-
troyed Rome, suggesting that the slaves
overran the city, sacked it and killed the
population, then disappeared in all direc-
tions with the loot. A more possible
answer could be an outbreak of bubonic
plague. To this day such plagues occur.
The bas-reliefs and Sanskrit writings do
not tell of this, and perhaps this will
forever remain the greatest mystery of
the Angkor ruins. Let us hope that this
treasure will not be closed to the West-
ern world, due to the international see-
saw of politics in South-East Asia.


The Age of Lash and Gusto?
Why many are proud of convict ancestors
A chain gang of the 1830 s drawn from life by Edward Backhouse.
By M. H. ELLIS
In 1837 there was secretly circulated
in New South Wales a book pub-
lished in London in 1835 by Major
James Mudie of Castle Forbes, in the
Hunter River Valley. It was called “The
Felonry of New South Wales” and it was
more like a bomb than a book. It was
mainly about Major Mudie’s enemies, the
emancipists who produced the “Sydney
Gazette”, other emancipists and their
allies who thwarted him, and the Gover-

It reads, at times, in its vindictive un-
truthfulness, like the work of one de-
mented. It was even more malicious
than parts of the Rev. John Dunmore
Lang’s “history”. But it was sympto-
matic of the conditions of the day.
To appraise it, one must understand
the story of the rise and fall of convict-
ism. No sound conspectus of that subject
exists covering all periods and phases.
Some writers have dealt very well with
sections of the subject. But in the main
they have judged the convict by one
class, or by his nature at one particular
period. Actually, there were three con-
vict periods, clearly defined.
The first was the pristine one in which
the convicts’ numbers were small, their
health generally frail, their experience of
life limited to London slums, which had
taught them to speak only the kiddie
language, the lingua franca of petty
crime, or to some rural scene. Most were
familiar with almost every petty crime
except the crime of work. Yet they were
pitted against the perils of the sea which,
during the voyages of the second and
third fleets, killed them off in hundreds
in conditions of filth and squalor.

With the onset of the French wars, the
stream of English felons tended to dry
up but was increasingly refreshed by con-
signments of the Irish, very many of
whom were not criminals and all of
whom regarded themselves as captive
martyrs of a foreign power and a foreign
religion, since they were denied their own
priests and sacraments and forced to sub-
mit to the ministrations of holy men
of the calibre of the Rev. Samuel Mars-
den. These sometimes literally flog-
ged them to the bone. For a great part
of the second decade of Botany Bay
history, Sydney and Parramatta were in
a state of armed alert against the need
to cope with rebelling Irish at a moment’s
notice.
In the earliest days of the colony, few
free men wished to stay in it. From the
Governor downwards they fled as soon
as permitted. But by the time the Govern-
ment had recruited the New South Wales
Corps to become the permanent “army”
of the settlement, land grants and the
assignment of servants and the discovery
that, if for nothing else, the convict

Since neither officers nor men of the
Corps, in the main, brought women with
them, it was obvious that there would
be a merging of the military and public
service and convict populations. Few in-
dulged in the formal luxury of marriage,
though that institution gradually became
more popular as time went on and the
Government more insistent. In the begin-
ning the community, so far as matrimony
was concerned, was on a strictly “do-it-
yourself” basis; and the example was set
in the highest quarters. The first com-
mandant and founder of Norfolk Island

Thus, within a couple of decades, the
towns of the County of Cumberland be-
came integrated communities, the white
native-born largely with both military or
civil employee blood on one side and con-
vict blood on the other, or with convict
blood on both sides. And the integration
of bond and free was the tighter because
of the induction of former convicts into
the ranks of the Corps, a proceeding not
unique to New South Wales.
It was an excellent arrangement from
the point of view of the participants that
young lady felons should minister to the
domestic comfort of the soldiery and
tired civil servants and in their spare time
develop their land or run shops or busi-

By the intermediate stage of the first
period of convict history, the social con-
dition of New South Wales was as
follows: The population was about 7500
the only other Australian white popu-
lation was a few hundred in Van Die-
men’s Land. Nine-tenths of all had con-
vict blood and something over 30 per
cent was actually convict under duress,
but living for the most part openly in
towns or on farms and working for sus-
tenance in spare-time labor.
Convicts and “emancipists” - freed
convicts and ticket-of-leavers carried
on most of the commerce, virtually all
the labor and more than their share of
drinking when any drink was available
very often, indeed, at that period it
wasn't and hadn’t been for a long time.
In August, 1807, the muster records were
remarkably frank about the domestic
states of every class. Among military offi-
cers, the commander of the Corps, the
quarter-master, the regimental surgeon
and two subalterns out of four were
credited with “concubines” instead of
wives. Among civilian officers the Sur-
veyor-General, the supernumerary Sur-
veyor-General, three civil surgeons out of
four were similarly placed. There was
no record depicting the domestic state of
the rank and file of the Corps.
But 703 settlers shared between them
290 wives and 272 concubines. Some
officers boasted no spouses of any de-
scription, but some acknowledged child-
ren. And an excrescence on the commu-
nity was the aggregation of “orphans”
who that year were unnumbered. They
were the waifs who could not boast of
knowing either father or mother, poor
abandoned little wretches mostly cared
for in the Government institutions. A few
years earlier they had accounted for more
than two-fifths of the whole child popu-
lation.
By this time, some convicts, pardoned
or freed by expiry of sentences, had risen
high in the community. Most of the
leading merchants, shipbuilders, South
Sea traders and entrepreneurs were re-
leased convicts, accepted generally ex-
cept by the very snooty. John Macarthur,
the Blaxland brothers and others of the
same social eminence were none too
proud to have the great emancipist mer-
chant Simeon Lord sign his name with
theirs as the leaders of the demand on
Colonel Johnston to arrest Governor
Bligh.
And the Macquarie Age reinforced
emancipist strength among the governing
classes as the conflict over the Governor’s
appointments of ex-convicts to the magis-
tracy and reception of them at public
Government House functions was gradu-
ally resolved. By the time the colony
had passed its thirtieth year, former con-
victs were not only in the magistracy,
one had sat on the Supreme Court Bench.
The Emancipists
rrtHE Government architect, whose death
sentence had been reduced to trans-
portation, was turning the rough camp
of Sydney into a town of whose churches
and public buildings any small Euro-
pean city might have been proud. All the
land was being surveyed and the streets
made orderly by a surveyor who was an
Irish exile. The bulk of the wealth of
the community was in the hands of
emancipists and convicts. And this
emancipist community had come to
take itself so much for granted as posses-
sing normal rights of freedom and pro-
perty, that it was deeply shocked in 1819
when a legal decision purported to de-
prive all the locally pardoned of the
rights of citizenship. The emancipists
over 1300 rose in united protest, ac-
quired leadership and made their petition
to the home authorities for self-deter-
mination and trial by jury and freedom to
trade, with the fetters of East India Com-
pany monopoly removed.
In their petition they limned their
economic status. The emancipist com-
munity, the startling figures showed,
cultivated three times as many acres as
the freely-come. Their pasture lands em-
braced 212,000 acres against the 198,000
of the “cleanskins”. They owned 43,000
horned cattle and 174,000 sheep against
29,000 cattle and 87,000 sheep owned by
free settlers. Their total wealth they esti-
mated at double that of those who had
never had their ankles bitten by a leg-
iron. In every way, except that they were
more healthy, better fed and, on the
average, breeding a more sober and
virile progeny, they were a normal
British community, as well behaved as
public spirited. Their moral standards,
their alcoholism, their modes of living,
their appreciation of art and yearning
for education and for liberty were on
the level of any British community. Their
trumpet, young William Charles Went-
worth, was already sounding in England
the charge to capture responsible govern-
ment from a reluctant Crown and Parlia-
ment.
From the home Government’s view-
point, the prospect presented by New
South Wales was not, at this stage, al-
together pleasing. The conditions in the
colony were so attractive that villains
were committing felonies to get them-
selves sent to such a paradise. They left
the gaols for convict ships singing and
hurrahing and advising passers-by that
they intended to spend their first Sunday
in Botany Bay in a “fine kangaroo hunt”.
The Reverend Ordinary of Newgate
heard them at it and was profoundly
shocked, but not so shocked as the
Government which set out to inaugurate
the second era of convictism in Australia
by solving the following problems: (1)
to restore New South Wales and its
attendant satellite colony Van Diemen’s
Land to the intended status as “a recep-
tacle for offenders in which crimes may
be expiated, at a distance from home, and
by punishments severe enough to render
transportation an object of real terror
to offenders”, while at the same time re-
forming them; (2) to turn the continent
into “a valuable possession of the
Crown”; (3) to achieve this by (a)
shunting to it the huge mass of returned
soldiers who began to flood the British
Isles after Waterloo, giving them land
and a start in colonial life, (b) by deed-
ing huge areas to chartered companies
for development, and smaller, but still
large, areas to individual capitalists for
on-the-spot or absentee ownership and
development, (c) by providing labor for
these new vast possessions by increasing
the export of convicts dredged from
among the thousands of hungry un-
employed who were starving because of
demobilisation or retrenchment conse-
quent on the shutting down of war-
industry production.
These latter were making so much of
a nuisance of themselves in riot and

stone-throwing at Royal carriages that
the Habeas Corpus Act had been sus-
pended. The militia had charged mobs
and everything was working up to the
crisis of Peterloo and the Cato Street
conspiracy. Crime had become violent
beyond precedent, since villains pressed
for war service had learnt from war to
live with violence and murder as daily
normalities. Death sentences were in-
creasing at such a rate that there were
not ropes or hangmen enough to deal
with the inflation.
The new class of criminal was food
for expiratory exercises which he would
regard with real terror. And if the crea-
tion of an aristocracy of landholders in
Australia, making the place a valuable
possession of the Crown through expan-
sion of the wool industry, presaged an
intensifying demand for self-government,
it at least could, be tried out gradually in
their hands. So Mr J. T. Bigge, formerly
a Chief Justice in a West Indian isle,
was sent out to discover how the Govern-
ment’s objectives could all be achieved,
and returned presently with a most satis-
fying recipe mainly concocted in the
fertile brain of John Macarthur.
Mow began the second era of Aus-
tralian convictism. The convictry
exported to Botany Bay and Van Die-
men’s Land no longer consisted mainly
of mild fellows paying the penalty of
minor crimes and peccadilloes. They
were big, bold, bad men with hair on
their chests, a large proportion of whom
would commit mayhem on you if you so
much as breathed in their direction.
They came in in raging floods. From
1819 to 1835, the actual convicts under
sentence comprised from 38 to 46.4
per cent of actual population, and two
strong regiments well armed formed part
of the residue population which other-
wise remained nine-tenths of convict
origin.
The new criminals could be no longer
allowed to wander at will and live freely
among the free. They were immured in
Government barracks, in estate barracks,
in horrible stockades like those in which
hundreds endured the hell of building
the Victoria Pass, down the western side
of the Blue Mountains. They were kept
in order with brutal floggings, solitary
confinement, refinements of punishment
that made the blood run cold. And when
they escaped, they were apt to take the
nearest master and tie him down on an
ant heap.
The convict colonies became a place
of terror, every glade with its bush-
ranger. The free were harassed and
frightened. No traveller could rove the
bush tracks without facing the dual
terrors of being staked out by some
bandit or grabbed by some panicked
lord of the manor and rudely hauled

before an equally panicked local bench
to explain himself. (And local benches
were not given to the benefit of the
doubt.)
There were now two convict-origin
communities; the old emancipists deriv-
ing from the pre-Bigge age and the new
which was more given to banditry and
violence than to self-reform. But the
emancipists kept well togethei and they
proved a nuisance to governments since
they had not only a cohesion of interest
but an ability of leadership and a power
of actuating public opinion that the
Government had never reckoned on.
Who could have anticipated that the
little servant girl Catherine Crowley
would breed a son like William Charles
Wentworth, a superb and forceful and
ruthless leader, planner and pamphleteer,
whose bold stroke in founding a free
Press was followed by multiplication of
journals crying out forcefully against
Government methods of repression of
the free established population and its
subordination of administration to the
needs of the punitive system? Who
could have believed that the son of
Thomas Jamieson, the surgeon's mate of
the Sirius, and a convict mother would
turn up as a Swedish knight, a great
landholder and an emancipist party
leader, out-shouting Wentworth in his
demand for responsible Government?
Who could have foreseen that the dis-
graced duellist naval surgeon William
Bland, or the Irish forger Edward Eager,
or a dozen more would become com-
munity leaders of ability and wealth?
Vet there it was. Government and
landed aristocracy were made to feel as if
they were living in a hive of mixed bees
and bushrangers. The noisy reprehen-
sion, and denigration of official charac-
ters, never seemed to cease.
On the labor front, no application of
rope and thong could induce a large bulk
of the new breed of felons to work. The
situation called for the import of free
labor in abundance, especially when the
age of steam in coal and transport began
to develop in the first years of the 1830 s.
This brought the free worker into con-
flict with the assigned convict and
at the same time with the masters of
the community. As the flood of immi-
grants swelled under the influence of the
bounty system, labor supply began to
outrun demand and the free immigrant
began to congeal into an army at war
with the currency lad and the emancipist
worker.
By 1835, when Major Mudie wrote
his notorious work and invented the
word “felonry” (so he said), the country
was one vast hubbub. The emancipists
were coming close to union with the
old exclusives on the issue of self-
government but were bitterly divided
from and with them on the question of
who should do the governing great city
masses or great country magnates. The
small settler and immigrant worker
clamored for removal of the convict
taint. The emancipists resented the slur
on their origins. The estate owner de-
fended his monopoly and his right to
cheap slave assignee labor. The small
entrepreneur resented the monopoly in
coal. And the only unity among mal-
contents seemed to be in agreement that
the Government was dastardly.
By 1838, when there were 50,000 free
or freed people in New South Wales, the
convict percentage of inhabitants had
begun to fall away against the back-
ground of expanding free immigration.
In 1840, transportation to New South
Wales had ceased and in 1853 to Tas-
mania. But in 1850, convicts began to
be sent to the west where transportation
finally died, after several fruitless
attempts to revive it in the east, in 1868.
It was many a decade before the con-
victs under sentence ceased to be a size-
able portion of population. In 1848
they still made up 38 per cent of the in-
habitants ol Tasmania, while in the
mother State they had been reduced to
under 3 per cent.
About 157,000 convicts, men, women
and children were transported to
Australia over a period of 80 years.
But emancipist and convict alike pre-
sently were engulfed by the huge influxes
of the free which followed the discovery
of gold. Where convicts continued to
serve their sentences, it was mainly
either on ticket-of-leave or en masse in
horrible receptacles like the settlements
successively of Newcastle, Norfolk
Island and Port Arthur.
legacy of convictism was an in-
A fluence for several generations. The
non-convict States of Victoria and South
Australia shared in its evils: the Kelly
gang was part of Victoria’s moiety, and
most of the other daring bushrangers
north of the Murray were of convict
origin.
At the time of Federation, Australians
generally could still resent Kipling’s
reference to their “birth stain” and even
more Earl Beauchamp’s quotation of it
as he approached Australian shores to
become Governor of New South Wales.
He told me that he was staggered at
the public reaction.
Even in the early 1930 s there was still
so much wariness about convict origins
that I was refused access to the index to
the “Sydney Gazette” at a leading re-
search library, lest I should discover and
reveal that some leading families were
of convict descent.
It is only since World War II that
there has been an almost complete
change of attitude. Many are even
proud of the naughtiness which gave
their families a start in life and listen
to the record of their misdeeds with
gusto.

Letters to the Editor
Onward and Upward
SIR.—If any of your correspondents in
matters political or economic had writ-
ten with the same careless regard for
accuracy as your man R. Thomas Wil-
liams has done for the Liturgical Move-
ment you would be the laughing stock
of Australia. I refer to the article en-
titled “High Church: Onward and Up-
ward” (The Bulletin, 24/10/64). The
following errors of fact should be noted:
• The Jazz Mass which allegedly has
“replaced” the ordinary service on Sun-
day mornings in Trinity College Chapel
has in fact only been performed on three
occasions.
• That great “supporter” of the
Parish and People Movement, the Rev.
Peter Bennie, does not even belong to
it.
• The Brotherhood of St Andrew
which has been “helping firmly to
establish and give maturity to the
Liturgical Movement” has not functioned
for over ten years.
• That High Church fiend, the Rever-
end Doctor Barry Marshall, so familiar
as the Deacon of the High Mass at St
Peter’s, Eastern Hill, has officiated in
that capacity twice in four years.
B. R. MARSHALL, OGS,
Chairman, Victorian Parish and
People Movement and Acting
Warden of Trinity College,
University of Melbourne.
SIR.—R. Thomas Williams in a some-
what misleading article made mention of
the “Parish and People” Movement. Mr
Williams suggested that the Movement
was aiming to further the cause of ex-
treme “Anglo-Catholicism” in the Church
of England in Australia. At the direction
of the Victorian Committee, I am writing
to say that such a suggestion is entirely
misleading.
It is a sufficient refutation to point
out that the present secretary of the
Victorian Committee is a “conservative
evangelical” in his theology, and that
several members of the staff of Moore
Theological College in the Diocese of
Sydney are active supporters of the
Movement in New South Wales
(Rev.)
R. STEPHEN CHERRY
Victorian Secretary.
Anti-Semitism
SIR. —Apartheid is not understood by
many people in Australia because it has
not been fully explained—except through
“The World In My Diary”. In this
series of broadcasts, five nights per week
over a period of more than six months,
I employed nearly half a million words
to explain the South African attitudes
towards Apartheid. These sessions were
supported by a weekly programme of
interviews recorded with Bantu,
Coloreds, Indians, Afrikaners, and
English-speaking white South Africans.
This comprehensive coverage yielded
a consistent letter-response from Austra-
lians who were glad to hear “the other
side of the story of South Africa”. In
fact, it is surely significant that not un-
til after the appearance of Mr Isi Leib-
ler’s article (The Bulletin, 26/9/64)
did the management of 3AW receive a
single complaint. Conversely, immedi-
ately following the same publication,
GTV-9 did receive letters of protest —
not against my opinions of Apartheid
but against the inclusion of Mr Eric
Butler in “The Norman Banks Pro-
gramme”. Simultaneously, I began to
receive letters from strange people who,
wittingly or unwittingly, mixed up the
separate matters of Apartheid and anti-
Semitism—as though the terms were
synonymous. The spate of writings
emanating from Isi Leibler and his col-
leagues, since his original article, also
follow this pattern. Indeed, I have the
impression that he is employing the
Apartheid issue as a means of access to
the columns of the Press for other pur-
poses, including the character-assassina-
tion of Mr Eric Butler. He apparently
forgets that Apartheid, which means
separate development for racial groups,
is not confined to South Africa. Is not
the State of Israel an example of separ-
ate development based on race?
I visited Israel a few years ago as
the guest of the Government; I went to
South Africa under the same terms and
conditions. My views of the two coun-
tries were given without fear or favor.
Yet, so far as I know, no one rushed
into print to accuse me of anti-Semitism.
I challenge anyone to produce evidence
to indicate that I have ever publicly
said anything prejudicial to the best
interests of Israel or the Jewish com-
munity in Australia.

Director, Public Affairs Dept.

SIR.—In response to my challenge to
Mr Isi Leibler to prove his outrageous
charge that I am a “Jew-baiter,” Dr John
Playford (“The Bulletin,” 24/10/64)
offers a concoction of distortions, mis-
representations and fabrication. His re-
liability, and his methods, can best be
tested not by going back 20 or more
years to documents not generally avail-
able today but by accepting his invita-
tion to “Let us now look at Mr Butler’s
more recent ‘The Story of Twenty Years
of Character Assassination’ (1960) in
which he repeatedly suggests that the
‘International Jews’ started the Second
World War (p. 17).”
The booklet mentioned by Dr Play-
ford is readily available, is a carefully
considered statement of my views on
the “Jewish Question” and other issues
raised by various smearers, and I always
recommend it to anyone who raises the
type of charges made by Mr Leibler. 1
invite those interested in truth to obtain
the booklet and to show me where I
repeatedly suggest on page 17, or on
any other pages, that the “International
Jews” started World War II. This

wide smear launched in 1959 to coincide
with my motion on Communism at the
Melbourne Anglican Synod, and my
other booklets and articles can be read
carefully without discovering the slight-
est evidence of any “hatred” of the Jew-
ish people, or any other people.
It is true that I believe that Political
Zionism is an international power move-
ment. I also believe that much of this
movement’s power is exerted through
finance. But in stating this, I am only
agreeing with the view of many eminent
Jews who are opposed to Political Zion-
ism. Clearly, Mr Leibler finds it intoler-
able that I should support the viewpoint
of his fellow-Jews. I have always favored
the conception of a National Home for
the Jewish people providing that this
was not achieved at the expense of other
people like the Arabs. Dr Playford knows
this, but deliberately seeks to misrepre-
sent my suggestion of 20 years ago, that
Madagascar might offer a suitable
National Home, as some diabolical anti-
Jewish threat.
I agree with the views of the American
Council for Judaism, and many promi-
nent Jewish leaders, that the creation of
Israel was a disaster for the Jewish
people and the whole world. By throw-
ing their full support behind the Political
Zionists, against the British and the
Arabs, the Communists helped to create
la situation in the Middle East which
they have since exploited with tremen-
dous success. To mention this irrefutable
history, and to recommend the works of
eminent Jews who are opposed to both
Political Zionism and Communism, is
alleged to constitute “Jew-baiting.”
In spite of Mr Leibler’s attempt to
smear me, I do appeal to him to stop
undermining his claim to be an anti-
Communist. Every new attack he makes
upon me produces an influx of Eastern
European migrants who, because of their
own unfortunate experiences, tend to re-
gard every Jew as a Communist. I find
it difficult to convince these people that
Mr Leibler is probably only a victim of
his own hysteria and not one more Jew-
ish Communist. My task is not made
any easier when Mr Leibler attacks one
of the most competent anti-Communists
in the Federal Parliament, Mr D. J. Kil-
len, MP. And it is most difficult when
Dr John Playford comes to Mr Leibler’s
defence. Dr Playford may have modified
his earlier radical political views, but
only recently Mr Leibler’s defender was
the guest speaker in Melbourne at the
annual meeting of the Communist-front
organisation, the Jewish Council against
Fascism and Anti-Semitism.
Finally, for the sake of the record, I
want to brand as a monstrous falsehood
the statement by Leon Glezer (“The
Bulletin,” 31/10/64) that I have “pro-
nounced Mr McEwen to be a tool of
the Jews.” No such pronouncement will
be found on page 50 of “The Inter-
national Jew” or on any other page. In
order to give some semblance of truth
to his story, Glezer correctly quotes a
sentence out of its proper context. On
page 50 I criticise Mr McEwen for hav-
ing advocated a loss of national
sovereignty to UNO. Because I criticise
Australia’s wheat exports to Red China,
believing that this policy is massive sup-
port for Communism, I suppose my
critics might well say that I have “pro-
nounced Mr McEwen to be a tool of the
Communists!”

REVIEWS
LETTER FROM LONDON
A Left-wing National Theatre?
By CHARLES OSBORNE
The National Theatre has now been in
existence for more than a year.
Recently, the Bristol Old Vic came
for a week with “Henry V” and “Love’s
Labor’s Lost,” and another two weeks
were taken up by the Proclemer-Alber-
tazzi Company from Italy who brought
Franco Zeffirelli’s production of “Ham-
let” in a new translation by Gerado
Guerrieri. Zeffirelli’s blend of ebullience
and carefulness has probably so far been
best employed in revivals of the ottocento
operas, but his “Amleto” was an intelli-
gent and interesting affair. It was im-
pressive, however, mainly because of the
performances it contains: the existential
Hamlet of Giorgio Albertazzi, the attrac-
tively sensual Gertrude of Anna Proc-
lemer, a Polonius who manages to com-
bine humor with rational characterisa-
tion, and an Ophelia fresh and
unburdened by tradition.
It was with “Hamlet” that the
National Theatre first opened its
doors to the public last year.
There had been much advance
discussion of the suitability or
otherwise of Sir Laurence Olivier
as director of a National company, a cer-
tain amount of criticism of the players
and directors he had assembled, and a
widely held feeling that although it might
be a good idea to open with “Hamlet,”
it hardly augured well for the future that
the Hamlet was to be a guest film-actor,
Peter O’Toole. Did the National Theatre
Company not contain an actor of its
own capable of playing the role?
Well, that was a year ago, and perhaps
it’s unfair to remember it all now.
O’Toole was a disaster. His Hamlet was
a rather shifty spiv in a pick-up bar. The
verse eluded him. Indeed, his ear was
so defective that at the performance I
attended he was dropping and adding
feet to the lines at random. Olivier's pro-
duction was absent-minded, the majority
of his cast seemed embarrassed, and it
was left to the senior members of the
company Michael Redgrave (Claud-
ius), Diana Wynyard (Gertrude) and
Max Adrian (Polonius) to save the
day as best they could.
The company’s fortunes rose with
their next two plays, Shaw's “St Joan,”
produced by John Dexter, and Chekhov’s
“Uncle Vanya,” produced by Olivier.
These had both already been seen at the
Chichester Festival Theatre (also run by
Sir Laurence), and the Vanya produc-
tion was well on the way to being con-
sidered a kind of classic. Olivier’s touch
was delicate and sure, and he, Redgrave
and Joan Plowright gave superb perfor-
mances.
“Hamlet” was quickly dropped, but
the repertoire was built up with “Hob-
son’s Choice” (only God and Redgrave
know why), Farquhar’s “The Recruiting
Officer,” Max Frisch’s “Andorra,” “The
Master Builder,” “Philoctetes” and
Beckett’s “Play.” The last two were a
double-bill. “Play” was interesting: the
Sophocles, completely misunderstood by
its producer, was not.
By towards the end of its first year,
the company had about half-a-dozen
productions in its repertoire.
Some, of course, were more
popular than others. There
were more performances per
month of “Vanya” than of,
for instance, “Andorra”. Inevit-
ably, the plays with Olivier or
Redgrave in them did better
business than those without. But, on the
whole, business was good. There were
still, however, some curious criticisms
to be heard. One was that the company
had a political Left-wing bias. It’s difficult
to know what to make of this. Olivier
himself appears to be uncommitedly
liberal; his dramaturge Kenneth Tynan
is doubtless further to the left, but I
defy anyone to find the slightest bias of
that kind in the choice of plays produced.
Of course there is a vague sense in which
most great plays of the past could be
described as “Left-wing,” but I don't see
any of these in the National Theatre’s
prospectus. And England’s most popular,
though tediously banal, Left-wing play-
wright Arnold Wesker is not represented.
Nor, alas, is that uneven genius Brecht.
Curiously, one critic complained some-
what irrationally that the National
Theatre’s production of Farquhar’s “The
Recruiting Officer” was un-Brechtian!
A more real cause for complaint, how-
ever, does exist. Surely a National
Theatre Company should contain some
of the finest talents available. This com-
pany is seriously deficient in its middle
and lower reaches. And even the three
stalwarts who tried valiantly to salvage
“Hamlet” are no longer with the com-
pany: Diana Wynyard died suddenly,
Michael Redgrave has left to open his
own theatre, and Max Adrian’s name
is missing from the roster for the coming
season.
At the moment, the company’s trump
card is its “Othello,” among the most
recent plays to be added to the reper-
toire. The production is no more than
competent, but Olivier’s performance is
of a shattering, Edmund Kean-like
grandeur and intensity, daring, audacious-
ly inventive, and in its immediate physic-
al impact, tremendously exciting. Sir
Laurence wisely rations his perfor-
mances, but it will go on packing the
theatre for as long as he can stand up
and play it.
No new English play was produced
during the first season, and of the only
two new plays from anywhere—Frisch’s
“Andorra” and Beckett's “Play”—it can
hardly be said that they are major
achievements. It is not, I suppose, in the
nature of a National Theatre to be wildly
adventurous, and if, over the next few
seasons, the company manages to collect
the best of Shakespeare, Shaw, Ibsen,
Chekhov, Wilde, and perhaps more re-
cent giants like Brecht and Tennessee
Williams, that would be sufficiently en-
couraging.
The new season has begun. It includes
Olivier as Benedick (to be directed by
Zeffirelli), and as Lear. But the first new
production, was the thirty-year-old “Hay
Fever” which the author, Mr Noel
Coward, directed. The revolution will
have to wait.

The perfectionism of modern opera

Rossini's “La Cenerentola” is an opera
on which perfectionism sits naturally
enough. Vocal agility, precision and style
are all here necessary ingredients in a
total effect which is one of carefree,
good-humored entertainment, and this
performance combines stopwatch pre-

cision with an irresistible snap and
sparkle.
The opera itself (“Cinderella” with
the fairy godmother and the magic left
out) is a sheer delight, and leaves one
puzzled that “The Barber of Seville”
should have held its place for so long,
as the only Rossini opera in the stand-
ard repertoire. “Cenerentola” has all
the tuneful effervescence of the “Barber,”
plus greater richness.
One feature that no doubt tells against
“Cenerentola” as a choice for the ordin-
ary opera company is the fact that (like
the “Barber” in its original version) it
demands a low-voiced coloratura for the
heroine’s part. Mezzos and contraltos in
opera have become so strongly associated
with sinister crones and discarded mis-
tresses that a low-voiced Cinderella is at
first a little disconcerting, but the bril-
liant Cenerentola of this recording,
Giulietta Simionato, proves that the right
singer can give the part all the lightness
and flexibility it needs, as well as the
darker touches that emphasise the
pathos of the untransformed kitchen-
wench.
The other outstanding member of a
near-perfect cast is Paolo Montarsolo, a
fine character-singer who makes a round-
ed, almost visible figure of self-seeking
pomposity out of Don Magnifico, the
father.
“La Boheme” is an opera for team-
work, not for stars, and although this
new HMV “Angel” recording is in its
way as satisfying as the “Cenerentola”,
one would not write of it in terms of
brilliance or single out particular per-
formances.
The qualities that conductor Thomas
Schippers and his team bring to this
most touching and ingratiating of operas
are a sense of balance and ensemble
and a sure understanding of the purpose
of the music, that match Puccini’s sure
sense of character, timing and contrast.
The whole work comes vividly and
truthfully to life, without anything that
is jarring or out of balance; there need be
no better recommendation for a
“Boheme” performance than that.
“The Age of Bel Canto”, of course,
is stardom with a vengeance; although
conductor Richard Bonynge has chosen
the music to provide as much contrast
and variety as possible within the defini-
tion of bel canto (in the popular sense
in which it is used here) the repeated
assaults of vocal fireworks become a
little exhausting. This is not a warning
against the recording, which is full of
musical interest as well as dazzling tech-
nique, but a warning against taking it in
incautiously large doses.
Bonynge’s selection of music shows an
intelligently exploratory historical sense,
which is also reflected in his authentic
and sympathetic direction of it. Little
of the music is hackneyed, most of it
is unfamiliar, and a good deal of that
quite unknown to anyone but the special-
ist.
The selection ranges from Handel to
early Verdi and on the way plucks from
the history books names like Piccinni,
Gluck’s defeated rival, and William
Shield, Haydn's English contemporary.
Sutherland’s seemingly effortless per-
fection of technique shows no sign of
diminishment, and she has worthy sup-
port from her two accomplished Ameri-
can collaborators.

Figuratives
Rodney Miigate. Recently at South Yarra
Gallery, Melbourne.
Mike Brown. Museum of Modern Art/Mel-
bourne.
Frank Hodgkinson. Recently at Gallery A/
Melbourne.
It is a pleasure to see the human figure
becoming more important in painting.
For the past few years it has been in
partial eclipse, but now young painters
seem to have taken it up again as their
chief subject. There is probably no
subject with greater depths and riches.
Sydney painter Rodney Milgate, who
has been showing in Melbourne for the
first time, treats the figure with dignity.
It is only in a handful of his paintings
here that the figurative starting point is
obvious on a first inspection, but it is
nonetheless present in most. The domi-
nant tendency of his style is to merge all
images, figure and background, into a
single, complexly-worked surface. His
sober Coloring and web of pale lines
deny depth or recession and thus give
every element of the image equal im-
portance.
Although it is not without a certain
poetic intensity of feeling, it is essen-
tially an art of refined understatement.
Its effect is as elusive as its half glimpsed
subjects. There is a reverence in his
themes and style which forbids direct
and clear images but which unmistakably
communicates muted joy, a longing for
fulfilment, a sense of quiet exaltation.
We find him in this exhibition in two
phases.
The later works abandon the wander-
ing line for simple boxed shapes and
burnt surfaces. The color is still nearly
monochrome, in brown or grey, and the
figure no longer the principal theme.
Unfortunately this more recent work is
somewhat depleted by the absence of
paintings still with this year’s Rubinstein
group, but the few here show the same
fineness of control beginning to adapt to
bolder statement. Some of the Rubin-
stein work is, I believe, shortly coming to
Melbourne. It should be seen.
For the moment Sydney painters have
the best of Melbourne’s exhibitions. On
the same day that Rodney Milgate
opened at South Yarra Gallery, another
young Sydney painter, Mike Brown,
appeared at the Museum of Modern Art
with what his catalogue describes as a
“motley collection of objets d'art to
be taken at face value.”
Some of Brown’s work has been seen
at the Museum before with the Annan-
dale Imitation Realists, and more recently
still in the luckless and notorious Mary-
lou. The Museum exhibition reveals
greater diversity. There is much more
painting than collage or assemblage, and
the painting includes both figurative
“pop” and abstract “hard-edge.”
Mike Brown’s “Kite” condemns Sydney
critics and painters, among them Frank
Hodgkinson, who had a one-man show
(I think his first in Melbourne) at Gal-
lery A. These are moody abstractions,
with only an occasional reminiscence of
figures and landscapes in yellow, brown,
orange, white and black. With these
earthy colors allied with rough textures
and a deal of accidental effects, fairly
simple, static shapes are created. Spanish
painting has clearly interested him and
many of his moods seem to be drawn
from hot, harsh landscapes. For all their
close-up roughness, they are elegant
paintings, gracefully colored, finely
organised and sometimes arresting.

Hitler’s Madness
The Black Fox. Director, Louis Clyde
Stoumen. Roma Theatre, Sydney.
This Crazy Urge (II Voglia Matta). Director,
Luciano Salce. Gala Theatre, Sydney.
Documentary, once defined as the
dramatic treatment of actuality, has of
recent years mostly meant the dreary
treatment of actuality — a series of facts
presented without imagination or drama.
How stimulating then to see “The Black
Fox”, a film which shows that docu-
mentary can be as exciting and reward-
ing as any piece of fiction.
Louis Clyde Stoumen, who wrote and
directed the film, presents a familiar
subject — the life of Hitler — with
originality, telling his terrible story with
a restrained emotion that never over-
balances into hysteria. As cross refer-
ences he uses the medieval legend of
Reynard the Fox, illustrated by engrav-
ings, Gustave Dore's illustrations of
Dante’s “Inferno”, and Picasso’s
“Guernica”.
Luciano Salce’s “The Hours Of Love”,
seen in Sydney recently, was so deriva-
tive in style that I felt his real name
must be Fellinioni. “This Crazy Urge”
shows less outside influence, but Salce
doesn’t seem to have any very definite
style of his own to offer. It's deftly
made, nicely photographed and not very
interesting.
Part of the trouble is in the script,
which labors a single not very original
idea beyond its capacity. A sophisticated
fortyish bachelor on a drive into the
country encounters a gang of teenagers
and (although they have already robbed
and humiliated him) becomes so besot-
ted by a 15-year-old girl that he spends
a beach-house weekend with them. His
efforts to vie with the young people
finally send him away sadly deciding to
be his age.
It says a good deal for Ugo Tognazzi
and Catherine Spaak that any of this is
credible. Their performances are pleas-
ing, but the film presents the young
people as such an unattractive pack of
yahoos that one can’t believe any reason-
ably grown-up man would have put up
with them for two seconds.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
THEATRE
Tightwad
The Miser. Moliere. Adapted by Miles
Malleson. Independent Theatre, Sydney.
The version of Moliere’s “The Miser”
which went down well with the miners
of Northern England is apparently just
right, too, for the middle-class audiences
at the Independent. It may be only the
current alleged shortage of good new
plays which persuaded the Independent
to put on a Moliere revival. Whether
or no, many theatregoers might be pre-
pared to let the next Albee or Diirren-
matt masterpiece wait its turn.
Alexander Archdale has produced the
play and taken its leading role. He care-
fully acknowledges that his production
is from the original by Tyrone Guthrie.
However, there seems no need for Arch-
dale, who played in the Guthrie produc-
tion in England, to be a bit modest
about his own part in the current pro-
ceedings.
Archdale has tackled “The Miser” as
if he were putting on a play, and not,
as so often happens, as if he were carv-
ing a monument to Moliere. He has put
plenty of life into it, although it becomes
sometimes a child which its own father
might not recognise. If something has
been sacrificed it might be style, but only
style in the deadly sense of a set way of
doing things, rather than in the sense of
presenting a point of view.
Archdale has a perfectly legitimate
point of view on Harpagnon. He plays
him, with much grimacing and gesturing,
a good deal for laughs. Occasionally and
rather outrageously he seems on the
verge of demanding sympathy for him,
but skips back quickly from this abyss.
But it is still an intelligent creation, in
balance with the other characters.
Accomplished support comes from
Doreen Warburton, the perfect picture of
Frosine, the hard-headed, soft-hearted
marriage-broker. The two sets of lovers,
Dianne Davis and Edmund Pegge and
Patricia Leehy and Warwick Sims have
the advantage of good looks, which
must be more than half the battle.
But not even the minor players, who
by the Independent’s peculiar, but no
doubt practical, system of combining pro-
fessional actors with amateurs, are drama
students, appear overawed by the play’s
great age and reputation.

Wilson - Britain’s Kosygin ?

Harold Wilson: A Biographical Study.
Gerard Eyre Noel. Gollancz. 30s. 6d.
The Relevance of British Socialism. Harold
Wilson. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. 275.

Hale. 265. 6d.
Some one hundred years ago, Walter
Bagehot, attempting to explain why the
British political system was so much
more stable than the French, pointed
out that the British political leaders, un-
like their volatile, intellectual French
counterparts, possessed the admirable
quality of stolid stupidity. It would be
tempting to elevate this apergu to the
status of a generalization (“A com-
munity is better governed, the more
stupid its political elite”) were it not for
the inescapable existence so close to
home of the Bolte Government.
Nevertheless, it is hard to deny that
there is more than a germ of truth in
this, for a rapid survey of post-war
world leaders suggests that the one
quality which they all fully share
is that of the faintly ludicrous. It is
hard to accept the fact that such comic
figures control the destinies of us all,
which is, I suppose, the reason why they
are treated with more seriousness than
they intrinsically deserve.
Of course, there have been exceptions
talented and yet recognisably human
one of the more recent (and tragic)
being Kennedy. And the simultaneous
emergence of two economist Prime
Ministers, Wilson and Kosygin, hard
upon the heels of another, Erhard,
suggests that the rule of the efficient
(and rather chillingly unspectacular)
technocrat may be upon us. Perhaps
advancing age and prolonged exposure
to the mass media may bring out the
charming idiosyncrasies of these
economist-politicians, but at the moment
we are somewhat at a loss when trying
to classify them in recognisably human
terms. What are they really like?
One way of answering this question
entails the making of comparisons with
well-known figures. Thus, just as the
newly-elected Kennedy was frequently
compared with Teddy Roosevelt (though
he personally would have preferred
Franklin Delano), Wilson has inevitably
been compared with the now familiar
Kennedy, largely, it seems, on the basis
of their shared youth. And yet Wilson
seems to lack completely one of Ken-
nedy’s more engaging qualities, the
capacity of being able to laugh at him-
self. Perhaps it might be more reward-
ing to look further afield for a com-
parison that may help to illuminate the
character of Britain’s new PM.
Gerard Eyre Noel, in his rather
tedious and ill-written biography, does
provide us with a clue, for he tells us
that the great hero of the youthful
Wilson was William Gladstone. Cer-
tainly there are striking parallels between
the careers of the two men: both hailed
from the industrial North; both took
firsts at Oxford; both veered left at
important stages of their careers; both
entered Cabinet as President of the
Board of Trade in their early thirties;
and both reached the heights of political
power in their late forties (although here
the parallel breaks down, for Wilson,
unlike Gladstone, was catapulted past
the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer
to the Prime Ministership by the death
of his leader).
However, the similarities between the
two men go somewhat deeper, for both
are strong individualists and defy classi-
fication in conventional political terms.
Just as Gladstone was a unique ad-
mixture of Tory, Radical and Liberal,
it is fruitless to attempt to decide
whether Wilson is on the left or right
wing of his Party, for he follows his
own independent line. While it is cer-
tainly possible to argue that Wilson has
been perfectly consistent as he has
fluctuated from left to right and back
again (Noel does quite a fair job of
this), it is also possible to place a nastier
interpretation upon his activities.
Thus Dudley Smith, an intelligent Tory
MP, is particularly adept, at suggesting,
without ever asserting outright, that
opportunism and excessive ambition have
provided the mainsprings of Wilson’s
behavior.
While it is impossible at this stage to
decide between these rival interpreta-
tions, one can at least draw one lesson
that in these days of collective
political solidarity, the man who sticks
with his mates (however inconsistent
their policy may be) is much less likely
to have his motives questioned than the
individualist who hews to his own line.
Nevertheless, one must admit that
Wilson’s refusal to allow any personal
ties to impinge upon political decisions
has led him to adopt some curious
positions. No doubt the outstanding
example of this was his decision to
accept the chance to replace the resign-
ing Aneurin Bevan on the Shadow
Cabinet in 1954, although Bevan at that
stage was his closest political ally and
although Wilson personally agreed with
Bevan on the policy issue which had
provoked his resignation! It is quite
possible to provide (as Noel does)
rational, or rationalised, grounds for this
decision, but there remains something
disturbingly cold about it.
Certainly one finds it difficult to
warm to Wilson (or to Gladstone) as
a person. Although, like most demo-
cratic socialists, Wilson combines con-
cern for inequality, injustice and in-
efficiency in his political ideology, there
is little doubt that the promotion of
efficiency is the dominant motif. And,
in developing this theme, Wilson makes
some curious allusions to the nineteenth
century. His proposed attempts to
eliminate the “old boy” network in
business management are likened to the
abolition of the practice of purchasing
military commissions (which was, in-
cidentally, a Gladstone measure), be-
cause in both cases efficiency is
improved.
Tn similar vein, Wilson claims that his
proposals for international monetary
reform are simply the application in the
twentieth century of “techniques which
in the field of domestic banking, our
forefathers (the capitalists! JP) developed
with such success in the nineteenth”.
Possibly because of its stress on
efficiency, Wilson’s book of essays,
although it contributes little to the
theoretical discussion of modern social-
ism, does impress one as being eminently
sensible. This is not to say that it is
likely to have been particularly success-
ful in achieving its ostensible goal
that of helping in Labor’s electoral
struggles—for it is also an extremely
dull book. Of course, Wilson may have
had other purposes in mind when writing
it—for example he may have hoped that
it would help him consolidate his
position within the Party by preaching
to the converted. In this, he may have
been more successful, for nothing quite
aids an intellectual in a Labor move-
ment more than the ability to be solidly
dull at appropriate times. Which may
go a long way towards explaining why
economists have something of an edge
over other Labor intellectuals . . .
Of course, Wilson himself is far from
a dull man. (It is a curious thing that
Smith, the political opponent, does some
justice to Wilson’s sardonic powers,
while Noel, who heads the second half
of his hagiography “Wit”, fails to report
one witty remark of his subject’s). But
he has been striving hard to project an
image of competent solidity, and this
may have been decisive in stemming the
Tory surge over the last months of the
campaign.

to the point of tedium, Wilson may well
have attracted the support of a significant
proportion of the upwardly mobile mid-
dle class, the “technocrats”, for emergent
elites are understandably responsive to
cries for the removal of the privileges
which stand in the way of their own
advancement.
So the technocrats may have found

Apocalyptic Election
The 480. Eugene Burdick. Gollancz. 265.
6d.
Eugene Burdick used to teach politics
at the University of California. His
switch to a literary career represents a
contribution to American popular cul-
ture and one must say it no great
loss to political science. He is a natural-
born slick writer, with enough of the
novelist’s perception of character and
detail to make his cliched, melodramatic
plots quite engaging. In contrast, his in-
sight into things political does not carry
very far, as his latest novel testifies.
The title refers to the number of
groups into which the American voting
population has been divided by the
Simulmatics Corporation, a real company
specialising in computerised market and
electoral research. The plot revolves
around the efforts (ambiguously suc-
cessful) of a couple of young, ambitious
social scientists to use the techniques of
simulmatics i.e., pre-testing, on a com-
puter, public reaction to any issue or per-
sonality or product to promote the
candidacy of a non-political hero for
the Republican nomination.
In a portentous preface, Mr Burdick
writes: —
There is a benign underworld in
American politics. It is not the under-
world of cigar-chewing, pot-bellied
officials who mysteriously run “the
machine.” . . . (It) is made up of
innocent and well-intentioned people
who work with slide rules and calcu-
lating machines and computers. Most
of these people are highly educated,
many of them are Ph.D.s, and none
that I have met have malignant politi-
cal designs on the American public.
They may, however, radically recon-
struct the American political system,
build a new politics, and even modify
revered and venerable American in-
stitutions ...
Now, I enjoy being titillated by apoca-
lyptic fantasies as much as the next man,
and can swallow my full draught of
science fiction without blinking. But it is
disconcerting to learn right at the outset
that Mr Burdick himself seems not to
know the difference between political
science and political science fiction.
The actual Simulmatics Corporation is
a struggling little company which, despite
the fact that it worked on a few problems
for the Kennedy organisation in 1960,
has since had a difficult time making
ends meet. Politicians have not been
flocking to its door. For one thing, com-
puters are very expensive to programme
and use. For another, no reputable social
scientist believes that simulmatics has
the magical potency Mr Burdick ascribes
to it.
There has been a tradition in Ameri-
can social science beginning with Les-
ter Ward, the founder of American
sociology, and still visible in our day in
the writings of Harold Lasswell that
sees the salvation of democracy in the as-
sumption of power by a new elite of
social engineers. Mr Burdick stands this
tradition on its head —not noticing how-
ever, that the tradition itself is by now
utterly discredited. For the single most
important discovery of social science, in
these last decades, is that social science
does not yield the kind of knowledge
about society and the kind of power
over society that physical science
possesses vis a vis the natural world.
In the specific case Mr Burdick pro-
poses the basic difficulty with simulmatics
is the two-party system itself. When one
party has a decided advantage over the
other, you really don’t need a computer
to tell you who is going to vote how, and
why. An ordinary public opinion poll
will suffice. When as is more often the
case the parties are fairly evenly
balanced, the computer is not better able
than an experienced politician or journal-
ist or pollster to guess just which votes
are going to make the difference, and
just what arguments will sway these votes.
As a matter of fact, the future of simul-
matics is far more hopeful (assuming one
cares) in commercial marketing than in
political manipulating.
All this aside, “The 480” is a skilful
fantasy for those who like their science
fiction domesticated, (ofns).

“Vulgar, Vulgar”
Americans Abroad: Two Centuries of Euro-
pean Travel. Foster Rhea Dulles. Univer-
sity of Michigan Press. 495.
What this well-documented and im-
mensely readable book immediately
points out, and then proceeds to illus-
trate in delightful and witty detail, is
that Americans are instinctively restless,
avidly curious, and that nobody criticises
the American tourist more virulently
than another American tourist.
The American Founding Fathers,
who allegedly left Europe for the New
World because their consciences bother-
ed them must have had, besides a high
moral sense coupled with an austerely
disguised spirit of adventure, remark-
ably itchy feet. No sooner were they
settled on strange land when they
promptly turned around and travelled
briefly back, either for more recruits, or
to show off, or for business. From
them, through the nineteenth-century, a
type of traveller to Europe was deve-
loped who, however much he astonished
Europeans and invited disapprobation of
himself, brought back to the newly cre-
ated United States hard-headed and
practical suggestions for making the ex-
colonies into a growing power.
There was the matter of the merino
sheep, for instance, which were so care-
fully guarded in the Spanish hinterland
they had to be smuggled into England.
A pioneer American tourist, David
Humphreys, a close friend of first Ame-
rican President George Washington,
liked the look of the sheep and promptly
arranged to have a herd of them driven
across Spain and Portugal in 1802 to
his sloop and then “conveyed” to his
Connecticut farm, from where they
eventually spread west to form a size-
able American industry.
The frequent excerpts from letters,
journals and diaries so tirelessly kept by
19th-century travelling Americans are
cunningly selected from a vast back-
ground of reading matter—(the biblio-
graphy is a treasure house in itself) —
pertinently to illustrate the impressions
and reactions of a particular epoch.
Abigail Adams, the alert and vivacious
wife of another early American Presi-
dent, initially found Paris “a horrid
dirty city” and was “shocked” and
“ashamed” at the daring theatrical per-

formances enabled her to “see them now
with pleasure”.
As transatlantic travel improved from
cramped little packets of 300 tons to
magnificent swift ships-of-the-line with
spacious private cabins, luxurious pub-
lic rooms and even bathrooms, Ameri-
can travel to Europe rapidly increased.
No longer was a cow kept on deck for
fresh milk, and poultry stashed away to
cackle in the longboats; the epicurean
cuisine became one of the great come-ons
of sea travel and Americans gratefully
discovered they had a gourmet taste
never dreamed of back in Oshkosh and
Squeedunk.
Almost every American literary and
art-world figure of the 19th-century (the
notable exceptions were Walt Whitman
and Emily Dickenson) went abroad to
Europe and became extraordinarily
vocal about what they saw and did.
Longfellow, sitting stuffily in a diligence
in Madrid admitted that when he saw
the local Bayonne custom he wished
himself out of it “a thousand times”.
The custom was travel on horseback
with a dark-eyed Basque girl for guide
and companion sitting on the same
horse. It seems a pity this imaginative
form of travel has fallen into disuse.
The reader is repeatedly struck by the
insight of these early tourists. Ralph
Waldo Emerson, a frequent transatlan-
tic voyager, defined a passenger in
terms that can be proven on the Can-
berra or Queen Mary today. “What is
a passenger?” he wrote. “He is a much
enduring man who bends under the load
of his leisure. He fawns upon the Cap-
tain, reveres the Mate . . . but his
eye follows the Steward.”
Railroads, aeroplanes and jets each in
turn contributed to swell both the num-
bers and variety of American travellers,
from students and struggling artists to
the international society set bent on
marriage to a Title. The outcome of
one such marriage between American
beauty and English nobility has become
a legendary figure even in his lifetime —
Winston Churchill —although a good
many others had less laudable progeny.
If Henry James threw up outraged
hands and declared all American tour-
ists to be “vulgar, vulgar, vulgar”, at
least Thomas Cook saw to it that this
same vulgarity changed the hotel system
(for the better) throughout Europe and
insured, by the institution of guided ex-
cursions, that no important site be un-
visited, no ruin or museum or gallery
by-passed, no cultural aspect unadmired.
Without revealing too much more of
the tempting fare Mr Dulles serves up,
admittedly liberally sprinkled with
famous names, a mention must be made
of the Great Breakfasters. There was
Disraeli who entertained a group of
lowa redskins over breakfast and pre-
sented them, braves and squaws alike,
with a basketful of bracelets and trinkets
as momentoes of the occasion, and James
Fenimore Cooper who gave lavish buck-
wheat-cake breakfast parties in his
princely Parisian mansion.
The publishers, The University of
Michigan Press, are to be congratulated
not only on a neat and faultless presen-
tation, but on an excellent, eye-catching
jacket.

Confessions of Zeno. Italo Svevo. Trans-
lated by Beryl de Zoete. Penguin. 7s. 6d.
A few years ago the English translation
of “La Coscienza di Zeno” was long out
of print. Vintage Books republished it
in 1958. Then Seeker and Warburg
began the publication of their uniform
edition of Svevo's work, and now, with
its appearance as a Penguin, there is no
problem whatever about obtaining it.
I urge everyone to do so. Angus Wil-
son recently included it in a list of the
fifteen “masterpieces (of this century)
that rank with the great works of the
past”. In fact it would do honor to a
much smaller list.
It has a curious structure. Still dis-
turbed by weaknesses of character and
bad habits which he has struggled against
all his life, Zeno Cosini, a Triestine some
fifty years of age, seeks the advice of a
psychiatrist. As a first step in treat-
ment the doctor instructs him to write
his autobiography. This he does, as well
as attending for several sessions of
psycho-analysis. But the therapy fails
(despite the doctor’s contrary opinion)
and Zeno gives it up. In revenge the doc-
tor publishes the memoirs.
This form (Zeno is encouraged to
write down whatever comes into his
head) gives Svevo the freedom he needs
to develop his peculiar comic genius, as
well as providing the opportunity for
some nice satire on psychoanalysis.
Svevo himself translated “The Inter-
pretation of Dreams”; he also invented
the most delightful parodies of the Freu-
dian dream: “I was not only kissing
Carla’s neck, I was positively devouring
it . .
But it was undoubtedly his acquain-
tance with Freud’s work that clarified the
Italian’s own ideas on the inconsequence
of human motive.
After carefully considering the respec-
tive merits of two beautiful sisters, Zeno
decides to make Ada his wife, but some-
how he ends by marrying Augusta, a
third, ugly sister whom he had not even
taken into consideration. After the wed-

ding, Zeno writes, “I began by making a
startling discovery. I loved Augusta as
much as she loved me.” Characteris-
tically he adds, “At first I refused to
believe it.”
This sort of pattern recurs in the
other fields of his life. When his father-
in-law advises him to sell some shares
he forgets. The shares unpredictably go
up in value and he makes a fine profit.
Whereas Zeno enjoys success in spite
of himself, Guido, the man Ada married
instead of him, and who seems to suc-
ceed in doing just what he wants, in the
end has some appalling misfortune. He
takes veronal to gain sympathy, but, as
the result of a series of pathetic acci-
dents, dies from the effects of only a
small dose.
Not that the author is suggesting it is
better to be like Zeno, only that it is not
better to be like Guido.
Towards the end of the book Zeno
gives up his struggle for improvement:
he cheerfully accepts the fact that he is
incorrigible. But then sustained success
in his business dealings reorientates him,
and he realises that lack of will-power is
irrelevant.
The last paragraphs contain a now
familiar prediction. “A man, made like
all other men of flesh and blood, will in
the quiet of his room invent an explo-
sive of such potency that all the explo-
sives in existence will seem like harm-
less toys beside it. And another man,
made in his image and in the image of
all the rest, but a little weaker than
them, will steal that explosive and crawl
to the centre of the earth with it, and
place it just where he calculates it
would have the maximum effect. There
will be a tremendous explosion but
no one will hear it and the earth will
return to its nebulous state and go wan-
dering through the sky, free at last from
parasites and disease.” This was written
in 1923.
In “Zeno” the author found his per-
fect mode of expression. The style is
oddly informal, discursive. Often one is
reminded of the present-day come-
dian’s manner a series of gags with
daringly casual links. It is a style that
naturally gives rise to aphorisms. Its
extreme spareness has the disadvantage,
however, that when Svevo wants to
create mood, the resulting passages of
description stand out rather uncomfort-
ably. All the more regrettable in that
he had no gift for descriptive writing.
Zeno is a superbly written character,
as well as being the ideal spokesman for
the author. When his father accuses
him of being mad, he has a doctor
write him a certificate of sanity. On
seeing it the father cries in despair:
“Then you really are mad.” From the
moment that a friend informs him there
are fifty-four muscles involved in each
step we take, he develops an intermittent
limp. This is one of the great clowns in
literature.
Svevo was by no means finished with
him in this book. When he died he had
begun a sequel to it and there are a
number of stories involving the same
hero, including one translated as “In
My Indolence”, available in various
anthologies. Health and disease, already
a prominent theme in “Zeno”, here do-
minates to the extent that Zeno, now 70,
takes a mistress to fool Mother Nature
who is supposed to kill us off as soon as
we are incapable of reproduction.
But it is misleading to speak of Svevo
“finding” his style as I have done. His
technique is so indissolubly one with the
vision it expresses the two must have
evolved together. I feel convinced that
the apparent gap (25 years) between this
novel and the earlier one must be
bridged by unpublished manuscript. If
this be true, what pleasures are in store!
The Penguin edition reproduces the
excellent introduction by Edouard
Roditi, written for Seeker and Warburg’s
uniform edition of the novels.

“It’s This Way” has all the outward
trappings of a lightweight book. It
is illustrated by Stitt, each chapter is
headed with a precis, like “Robinson
Crusoe”, and the action takes place in a
town called Tabuggeree. However, Dan
Reidy, in his first novel, has a serious
intent. His book is “fiction in the guise
of autobiography” and his hero is a
young teacher consigned to the bush and
a school of over 40 children after very
little experience. At first he confesses
he is in the profession because of the
spare time it affords; in this time he
intends to educate himself; he reads
Thoreau and Spinoza. But gradually
he becomes more interested in the
theories of education and he delves into
Montessori, Froebel and Pestalozzi.
When he introduces the Dalton system
into the school, officialdom, in the form
of Inspector Borger, lays its heavy hand
on his enlightened schemes. Naturally,
since the hero is an idealist, he resigns.
He has bought a car and caravan and he
marries the girl of his dreams and even-
tually he becomes a taxi-driver. On the
final page he discovers that all along
he has been an unwitting Existentialist.
David Rowbotham, a 40-year-old
Queenslander, is a poet and journalist.
His first novel, “The Man in the Jungle”,
is, unfortunately, an incompatible blend
of two vastly different modes of expres-
sion: poetry and tabloid journalism.
The plot involves a triple hunt. A
newsman has become lost while trying to
locate a crashed ’plane. A party sets out
to find him and the ’plane, but almost at
the outset a black tracker is murdered.
The killer is believed to be an old
Swedish hermit who vanished, with a
kettle of gold, into the forest years be-
fore. After the murder the plot flies
apart under its own momentum.
In his second novel the New Zealand
writer Ronald Hugh Morrieson exhi-
bits a fresh and exuberant talent. “Came
a Hot Friday” is set in the North Island.
Tainuia Junction, a decaying railway
town, explodes into action after the
arrival of two superbly characterised
young con-men, Wes Pennington and
Cyril Kiddman. Morrieson deals up
arson, sex, murder, bashings, car chases
and a beautifully staged hold-up of a
gambler by the Te Whakinga Kid, a
Maori who dresses and speaks like a
kinematic Mexican bandit. Since the
scenes and characters are so vividly
described, one can accept the crazed
convolutions of the plot and the dia-
logue, a wild mixture of naturalism
punning, catch-phrases and interpolated
pop-song words and titles.
Wes and Cyril team up with Don, a
resident of Tainuia Junction, to cheat
Norm Cray, the bookie, out of more
than £4OO. Don’s attitudes are set
against those of his father, a Digger who
lost a leg at Gallipoli. And it is also
his sexual exploits which we follow.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Britain’s Unpleasant Task
Britain’s proposals to impose a temporary 15 p.c.
charge on all imports other than foodstuffs, basic raw
materials and unmanufactured goods could have an
indirect effect on Australia. By restricting the importation
of manufactured goods and stimulating her own export
drive, Britain will be striving to compete more strenuously
with other manufacturers on world markets. They, in turn,
must increase their efforts to maintain existing markets and
replace any markets lost in Britain.
Australia is not a large exporter of manufactured goods
to Britain. But there are some items which could be affec-
ted, such as metal manufactures, machinery, electrical ap-
pliances, leather manufactures, toys, fancy goods, sporting
equipment, pharmaceutical goods. And if German, Ameri-
can, Japanese or other manufacturers find that markets
are tougher in Britain, they naturally will endeavor to
expand their sales in places like Australia.
Britain’s worsening (and “unacceptable”) balance-of-
payments position demands drastic action and suggests that
the proposed Commonwealth Exports Council will be put-
ting pressure on Commonwealth countries to buy more
from the Old Dart. The British motor industry has served
notice that it will be extremely active in 1965; big things
are expected of a flock of new designs. It is obvious, how-
ever, that some belt-tightening will need to be imposed on
the internal economy in Britain which, inevitably, could
cause a cut-back in the demand for raw materials and even
certain types of foodstuffs.
Already it is being pointed out that Britain is opposing
GATT with its proposed new trade restrictions and weaken-
ing its borrowing status with the International Monetary
Fund. It is hardly a happy beginning for the new Labor
Government with its slender majority. It was recognised
before the election, though, that whatever Government
was returned to power, some drastic house-cleaning was
necessary.
To a lesser extent, the same applies to the USA, where
some delayed restraints may need to be imposed after the
Presidential elections.
Is It Worth £l4 million?
Holt’s new tax legislation for companies,
based largely on the Ligertwood Committee’s report
of 1961, appears unseemly in its belated haste. If it took
this long to table the legislation, surely the representatives
of the people most affected should have some time to
consider its implications.
After all, the proposals have far-reaching effects on com-
pany structures, both private and public, as well as on
superannuation funds, partnerships and the like. The gain
to Federal revenue is estimated at £l4m., plus whatever
may be saved by removing the incentive to buy company
tax losses.
Latest tax proposals the first major change in com-
pany tax structure for 30 years took three years after
the Ligertwood report to reach this stage. The people af-
fected should have a little time to report to the Government
on the implications of the new legislation. No one decries
the justification of tax legislation to close up loopholes for
the chronic tax dodger. And no one is entitled to be given
forewarning so that he may place his affairs in order.
After all, the sellers of merchandise receive no prior
warning when sales tax is increased.
There is one small difference, however. The latest tax
legislation affects most private companies in Australia, in-
cluding some private companies already taxed as public
companies, as well as superannuation funds, family trusts,
etc. Last, and by no means least, is the implication to in-
vestors that tax loss companies no longer have any value,
unless the smart boys can get round the provision that 40
p.c. beneficial ownership must remain constant when tax
losses are claimed. This aspect is contrary to the Ligert-
wood findings and has thrown many companies, which
have purchased tax losses, into a flat spin. Previously they
counted on seven years in which they could use up those
tax losses, for which they paid good money, like 35., 3s. 6d.
or even 4s. in the £l.
On the surface, those companies must use up their tax
losses this financial year, or forgo them. This may be hard
cheddar, but the average taxpayer has no sympathy. What
is upsetting most people, however, is the wide powers
given to the Tax Commissioner to use his discretion. He
always did have wide discretion, but tax authorities (as dis-
cussed in an article on page 60) believe that the latest
tax proposals are being rushed through too quickly and
with excessive discretionary powers given to the Tax
Commissioner.
The professional tax minimisers may get around the prob-
lem, but it seems that the legitimate private company is
going to be hit hard. Hence the feeling that the Stock Ex-
change lists could receive a rush of new applicants from
would-be public companies. This may solve a temporary
tax problem for the private company owners, but it poses
the question of whether public share investors will be asked
unfairly to support a bloated capital for companies which
served the public best as privately-owned organisations
(nursing their losses and lack of dividends in private suffer-
ance during lean years, but possibly reporting magnified
losses as public companies when results are assessed against
an inflated public capital structure and the added burdens
of public company costs, such as shares register expenses
and the like).
Will the Treasury really be £l4 million better off?

More Funds for Phillips
battle to break into the highly competitive petroleum
retailing market in Australia is underscored by the
latest decision by Phillips Oil Products Ltd, which is halv-
ing its capital by writing down 2s. 6d. a share, then making
a new issue of five-for-one ordinary shares, thus raising
£2.2m. in new capital.
The “Phillips 66” brand came to Australia in May, 1962,
when the company broke into southern Queensland and
northern NSW. Australian shareholders participated in the
company flotation and the shares were listed on the Stock
Exchange. After some stiff losses, the US parent company
offered to buy back the shares held by Australians. Quite
a number of local shareholders decided to hang on and the
shares are still listed. Despite accumulated losses of
£432,244 to June last, shareholders doubtless took note of
the activities of the US parent in developing natural gas
prospects on leases west of Moonie, Queensland, in partner-
ship with Sunray Corporation.
Apart from the obvious expansion currently planned in
petroleum retailing outlets, Phillips is expanding its lique-
fied petroleum gas business and is buying out its partner,
Propane Corporation, which holds the other half share of
Liquefied Petroleum Gas.
Amoco, another US newcomer to the Australian scene,
doubtless is watching this activity with more than passing
curiosity as it ponders its own problems of gaining an in-
creasing share of the Australian gasoline retailing business.
“Cheap” Land Getting Dearer
Prices of home-building blocks on the outer limits of
Sydney and Melbourne are still tending to rise, more
so in Sydney than in Melbourne. In both metropolises
buyers have to go out further distances to secure moderately
priced land.
A careful statistical survey by the Melbourne-based
Housing Industry Research
Committee, covering twenty
municipalities, suggests that
Melbourne’s fringe land costs
went up by nearly 6 p.c. dur-
ing the year ended June 30.
The sample does indicate,
though, an apparent slowing
down in the annual rate of in-
crease, which for 1962 was 7.7
p.c. and 1963 7 p.c. During
1963-64 buyers paid an aver-
age £l4OO a lot.
No such exact figures seem
to be available for Sydney,
but a round-up of real estate
agents thoroughly confirms the
Melbourne situation, with the
important addition that the
yearly rate of increase is not
declining. In suburbs west of
Parramatta, blocks fetching
£l5OO a year ago now sell for
round about £1750.
The HIRC sees the rate of
increase levelling out at be-
tween 4 to 6 p.c. a year and
believes the purely speculative element in land sales is
gradually disappearing. Nevertheless, higher land costs must
be borne by the home buyer from his loan or from a
saved deposit. The so-called “deposit gap” is thus agg-
ravated. Institutional loans do not lessen the problem.
Australian Petroleum Consumption
THE difficulties of Phillips Oil Products Ltd are discussed
in an article on this page. Changes in Australia’s
demand for all petroleum products are well illustrated by
the above graph. The three “junior” distributors, Phillips,
Amoco and Total, between them account for somewhat less
than five per cent of the motor spirit market.
Maximum loans from the institutions have, of course,
risen over the years. Yet land is not the only strain for the
new-home buyer. Fashion now decrees a move towards
brick-veneer houses in the outer areas. These run out at
between £4500 and £4750.
Japan and UK Measures
ThtE very evident pressure on Japan to lift its exports to
Australia, principally for balance-of-payments reasons,
could be heightened by the UK surcharge on imports.
Japan’s Foreign Minister, Mr Etsusaburo Shiina, believes
that the British measures may affect some 50 or 60 per
cent of his country’s exports to UK. These now total about
£A70.6 million a year.
The items mainly concerned comprise transistor radios,
cameras and motor cycles not particularly goods
Japan is trying to push into Australia. The drive here seems
rather towards heavier capital equipment. Yet Japan has
closely to consider the currency aspects of its foreign trade.
A rebuff in one place must lead to greater concentration on
other markets.
Mr Shiina says quite bluntly that the British pro-
cedures run counter to GATT and gravely affect the (some-
what somnolent) Kennedy Round. He intends to take up
the surcharge “within the framework of GATT”.
Britain’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr James
Callaghan, has defended the form of the trade proposals,
stating that a surcharge mechanism is “less likely to freeze
patterns of trade . . . than any other measure.” He warmly
denied that Britain was “becoming protectionist or desired
to be protectionist”.
Help from Oil Search
Tt seems a far cry from oil exploration to shipbuilding,
but Britain’s ailing shipping industry is being bolstered
at the moment by orders for offshore drilling equipment,
including drilling platforms
and supply vessels.
Main reason for the influx
of orders is the sudden interest
in offshore drilling in the
North Sea. Phillips Petroleum
started the ball rolling last July
when its drilling company,
International Drilling, placed
a £stg 1.75 m. order for an off-
shore drilling rig with the Scot-
tish shipbuilding firm of John
Brown.
Since then, Shell and Burma
North Sea have ordered two
offshore drilling rigs through
Smiths Dock Co. Shell also is
involved indirectly in the
ordering of an oil rig service
vessel which will be chartered
through George Wimpey and
Co., who ordered the vessel
through Clelands.
The upshot of all this is
that the shipbuilders are ex-
pecting further orders for three
offshore drilling rigs from
Mobil, BP and the Gas Council-Amoco group. Naturally,
they are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that there
will be sufficiently encouraging signs of natural gas under
the North Sea to stimulate further orders for drilling equip-
ment.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Captains and the Kings
IPA’s cold comfort on living standards
jl/foRE commonsense is spoken about
Australian economics in the ambit
of the Institute of Public Affairs than
anywhere else in the country, and the
reason is not hard to seek. Here you
have a group of trained economists who
have been matching word and opinion
against the finest business brains in Mel-
bourne for the best part of twenty years.
In the result, it is virtually impossible
for economic nonsense to be given
currency through the media of this
organisation. So, while there is room for
disagreement by partisan interests on
what the IPA says, it is a pretty safe bet
that those looking at things from a
national viewpoint will generally be in
accord.
The annual meeting of this body is
one where an angel from the Press might
be excused for fearing to tread, let alone
open his mouth. For, as this year, it’s
as likely as not to have one of the
captains of industry, business or finance
within shooting range. It could be Sir
lan Potter or Mr Angus lones, or maybe
Lord Casey or Mr Hegland of GM-H,
Norman lones of BHP, or any of the
large number of magnates who comprise
the council of the Institute. When the
likes of Mr Hegland or Mr Lampe, the
president, take the rostrum you know
they are not going to indulge in cliches,
if only because the audience is expecting
something better.
This year the pace was set by the
president, Mr F. E. Lampe, who has
a legendary reputation as a retail trader
in Melbourne (he was formerly managing
director of Mantons before it was taken
over by G. J. Coles). He started off by
saying the economic prospect was
wonderfully good. The longer he stayed
on his feet the more it had to be won-
dered how good it actually was, because
he was soon talking about the various
strains the economy is being subjected to.
The list of these was long, even if con-
cise, and with some variation to that
recently provided by the ANZ Bank (see
Bulletin, October 17, page 60).
11/Ir Lampe summarised the strains:
“severe labor shortages have appear-
ed; costs and prices are moving up; taxes,
both State and Commonwealth, are in-
creasing; the charges of public utilities
such as electricity, television and public
transport are going up; the tide of
imports is rising perhaps a little rapidly
for complete peace of mind. In the three
months to September, 1964, the import
bill was about £62 million greater than
the corresponding months last year,
creating a trade deficit for the period of
£4O million. The stability which we were
enjoying up to a few months ago has,
quite suddenly, been disturbed.”
So what is happening to the planned
objective of growth with stability? Unless
we are very careful we will be off again
on the old upward spiral of inflation,
with all the frustrations and problems to
D. L. HEGLAND
which it gives rise, Mr Lampe said, and
then went on to look at the roots and
branches of the spreading inflation tree.
He saw the tree as having its roots in
a clash of opposites or a conflict of pur-
poses: “On the one hand there is the
patriotic, community-spirited side of the
Australian character which wants to see
this country develop and populate with
the utmost rapidity and which is pre-
pared to pay whatever price this may
demand. But, on the other hand, there
is the side of the Australian character,
which, quite understandably, wants to
maintain and to improve, also as rapidly
as possible, the immediate standard of
living. Now whilst in the long term these
two things that is, rapid growth and
improving living standards —go together,
in the short term they may clash.”
This is part of the paradox Mr T. R.
Carruthers failed to see in his address
to the Advertising Agencies Convention
in Melbourne last week, as we pointed
cut in last week’s issue. In a word, Mr
Lampe meant there was not sufficient
public appreciation of the need to canal-
ise more resources, into investment, and
also the public sector, at a temporary
sacrifice of rising living standards, in
order to ensure the appropriate rate of
growth.
“JT\)day we have the paradox that
whilst practically all of us object to
paying higher taxes, practically all of us
are demanding more of the things that
only higher savings, loans and taxes can
provide. This would appear to be the very
crux of our problem. We can have high-
speed development, both in the public
and private sectors, provided we are
prepared to pay for it, but we can only
pay for it by curbing our natural desire
for better living standards in the present.
“If we want to avoid inflation, we must
set our national targets and ambitions
no higher than we, as a community, are
honestly prepared to make sacrifice to
achieve. It is no good blaming the
Government for putting on higher taxes
to pay for development —if we are
clamoring for development. We have
to look the problem squarely in the eye.
Perhaps what is needed is a lot more
education and leadership on this prob-
lem, education from the Government
and from leaders in different walks of
life.”
The managing director of Mobil, Mr
E. A. lones, took up this theme of the
need for more education on economic
matters. And so did Mr H. Scambler,
the general manager of the ES and A
Bank, who follow'ed him (Mr David Heg-
land, managing director of General
Motors-Holden’s, who was down to
speak, pulled out at the eleventh hour—
doubtless bending all his efforts to end
the strike and thinking perhaps that more
education on national economics in the
unions might well have prevented it
happening in the first place).
Everybody seemed to agree that the
IPA was doing a good job in furthering
wider appreciation of national economic
affairs, as well as of the virtues of free
enterprise whose banner it has been hold-
ing aloft since the war and with salutary
results. There is no doubt, as Mr Scam-
bler stressed, that the area to be under-
stood is getting more complex and wider
as the days go by, more sophisticated,


too. This demands greater efforts at
understanding, the forming of independ-
ent judgments. The earlier people got
down to the effort the better. On this
Mr Scambler had a good word to say
on the penetration of the IPA’s litera-
ture into the schools, just as Mr Jones
applauded the response of the Press in
giving IPA articles a good run in its
columns.
However valuable, though, the IPA’s
literature is, couldn’t the Institute do a
great deal more, especially if it combined
ifs efforts with those of the Committee
for the Economic Development of Aus-
tralia which operates in its own vacuum
round the corner in Flinders Street? To
make itself even more effective in the
battle for economic enlightenment the
IPA should be sending out more frequent
pronouncements on economic issues as
they are thrown up from day to day;
holding public forums on such issues;
talking to schools, clubs and societies;
and generally bringing itself more into
the public spotlight.
CROESUS
While Punters Do Their Dough
A prosperous economy faces some dangers
"C'conomic punters have been on tenter-
hooks for a long time fearing the
exuberant economy may be riding for a
fall. Some of these veteran nail-biters
were predicting economic tosses from
credit and wages eruptions to throw
prosperity off course two Melbourne
Cups back. Yet here we are at another
one and still on the brink. The only con-
clusion is that handicappers Wilson and
Coombs have been the closest followers
of the form. So while spenders “do their
dough"’ at Flemington, these gentlemen
will possibly be taking satisfaction, if not
in the rise in consumer prices, then in
another month’s excellent savings figures
and perhaps in the reduction of demand
and pressures on resources occasioned by
the motor-workers’ strike.
Australia has for so long had a reputa-
tion of being a nation of spenders that
it is refreshing'to find some overseas
countries taking leaves from our book
of savings media. The latest to do this
is New Zealand, which last month let the
private trading banks into the savings
field in competition with the State-owned
trustee savings banks. Quite recently
Britain adopted our idea of special bonds
in issuing a series of Development
Bonds, with a high interest rate coupon
and a measure of capital appreciation on
maturity thrown in for good measure.
The fact is, of course, that caution in
spending and its counterpart of high
savings have been the salvation of the
economy during the current period of
full employment, and the outside world
has taken notice. True, price stability has
in itself encouraged a high rate of saving
in the past three years. Coupled with this,
a large number of people have remem-
bered the lessons of the last boom, when
they over-spent and were caught. They
don’t relish being caught out a second
time. Even so the strength and variety
of choices in savings media have had a
good deal to do with the continued
addiction to saving.
The latest savings bank figures are
most impressive. Deposits of £23.7 mil-
lion this September were 13.2 p.c. higher
than September, 1963. This percentage
increase is slightly below the record 13.6
p.c. rise in the year to June last (in the
five previous years savings bank deposits
rose by 13.2 p.c., 11.2 p.c., 11.2 p.c., 3.2
H. McE. SCAMBLER
General Manager, ES & A Bank
p.c. and 9.2 p.c. respectively). But it was
higher than the first two months this
financial year. In monetary terms, savings
bank deposits this September were £5.2
million more than in the same month last
year.
What distinguishes the record of the
savings banks from the equally impres-
sive performance of savings through
Government loans media is that it is
entirely spontaneous, whereas the latter
owes much to new official devices to
capture the funds of financial institu-
tions, including the savings banks. We
owe it to the savings banks themselves
for whipping up public enthusiasm for
savings and more particularly in the last
few years to the strong competition pro-
vided by the savings banks formed by
the private trading banks.
Oince the Wales and the ANZ initiated
the entry of the private trading banks
into savings bank activities in January,
1956 (soon followed by the CBS in June,
1956), all the private trading banks have
formed savings bank subsidiaries. (The
National started savings bank business
in September, 1961, ES & A and Bank of
Adelaide in May, 1962, and the CBA in
July, 1962.)
A measure of their success is that in
August this year their combined deposits
were £655.4 million and, having passed
total deposits of the State savings banks
in November last year, are creeping up
on those of the Commonwealth Savings
Bank. In the year to August, the private
savings banks increased their deposits by
£126.3 million to £655.4 million, the
State savings banks by £56.8 million,
and the Commonwealth Savings Bank by
£92.7 million to £1047.2 million. The
most successful of the private banks is
the Wales, whose deposits of £2Bl mil-
lion in August were more than double
those of the ANZ, £l3B million, the next
biggest.
It was fashionable to argue last year
that the high rate of savings and the
modest increases in retail sales were the
most effective forces sustaining price
stability in a year of sharply rising per-
sonal incomes, that in fact the propen-
sities to save and spend remained virtu-
ally static. The question now is whether
after the 1.2 p.c. increase in consumer
prices in the September quarter this still
applies. The above savings figures for
September and the depressed retail sales
for August (only 3.6 p.c. up on August,
1963) would in themselves suggest little
or no change.
This is also arguable from the Com-
monwealth Statistician’s details explain-
ing the rise of 1.2 p.c., or from 127 to
128.5 in the consumer prices index
(which, incidentally, was the biggest in-
crease since the index rose by 2 points
to 12.1 in the June quarter, 1960). First,
nearly half the rise (.7 of a point) is
attributed to a time-honored swing in the
prices of meat and potatoes. Second, the
higher imposts in the Federal Budget on
cigarettes, tobacco, motor cars and ser-
vices accounted for a like amount.
Throwing in the basic wage rise in June
after discounting these two influences, it
couldn’t be said that much of the rise
would be attributable to any change in
the propensities to save and spend or

that inflationary pressure is exerting itself
on the demand side.
With personal incomes rising at be-
tween 7-8 p.c., it would seem that
increases in industrial output and imports
have been acting as substantial buffers
in cushioning price increases to this stage,
especially in household goods and ap-
pliances, whose index dropped in the
September quarter. Moreover, these in-
fluences will continue to be vitally im-
portant in mitigating price increases.
Against this, from now on, cost infla-
tion would be expected to show through
in prices to an increasing extent, as more
and more firms exhaust their profit mar-
gins in meeting cost increases (some of
which derive directly from increases in
the charges of public utilities).
inflation is already pervasive,
though at this stage it is much less pre-
valent in private industry than in public
utilities such as railways and tram and
bus services, where profit margins (if
any) are always narrow and a rise in the
basic wage is more likely to force a
public authority to increase fares or
charges (especially where the chances of
increased Government subsidy are thin).
What is more, demand for most public
utility services is fairly inelastic. With
the bigger scope afforded for spreading
overheads, the expansion of an indus-
trial firm’s output makes absorption of
higher primary costs easier than in most
public utilities, especially those where de-
mand for the service is least elastic.
Thus there are strong grounds for
thinking the main danger is in the pos-
sibility of an increase in cost-push, a
view which this column has held since
the basic wage rise earlier this year. This
view became the more tenable after the
Federal Budget increases in taxation and
charges, followed by similar action by
some of the State Governments, which
lifted cost and political pressures alike.
The most visible dangers on this side
at the moment clearly stem from the tight
labor situation and are reflected in the
GM-H strike for higher over-award pay-
ments. At a time when most of the in-
come generators refuse to pause for
breath, curiously enough the automotive
industry, whose outpouring of wages has
been at the centre of the lift in effective
demand so far as that has come from
industrial activity, has done so. What-
ever social evils can be seen in the pro-
tracted motor strike, our mythical econo-
mic man will see in it a temporary ease-
ment of income generation as well as a
reduction of pressures on scarce econo-
mic resources. The trouble is it will be a
different matter if the strike sets off a
new round of over-award pay increases
in industry as a whole, as is the unions’
aim.


The New Taxation Bill
Discretionary powers too wide?
fTUx consultants have expressed alarm
that the Treasurer should push
through the latest tax legislation so
hurriedly.
Probably never before in the history
of Australian taxation has there been
any more complex or such far-reaching
legislation. Yet it is being rushed through
suddenly, after a delay of three years
since the report of the Commonwealth
Committee on Taxation.
It cannot be claimed that tax revenue
is the cause of the haste. No new tax
revenue will be payable to the Tax
Commissioner this financial year, so the
Tax Bill could be delayed a little until
the people most affected have a chance
to digest what’s in it.
One tax consultant said: “I feel it is
iniquitous and most undemocratic to try
to force through Parliament such com-
plex legislation without giving those in-
terested and those most affected a rea-
sonable opportunity to consider the
legislation. It has been almost impossible
to obtain copies of the Bill and the
Treasurer’s explanatory notes. There are
116 pages of explanatory notes.
Poivers too great
“I am very much opposed in principle
to retroactive legislation. I do not think
anyone can object to the Government’s
moves to block up loopholes so long as
the tax authorities say, ‘Well, all right.
This is the position from now on.’ But
if you have done things in accordance
with the law in the past, I think it is
wrong to go back and impose retroactive
taxes on such people who have acted
within the law.”
The Commissioner’s discretionary
power is extended under the new tax
amendments to such a degree that it
would be an impossibility for him per-
sonally to exercise that discretion in the
thousands of cases that must crop up
throughout Australia. Different assessors
operate in each State. Therefore the
Commissioner must delegate his autho-
rity and the delegation of that authority
will be necessary to such an extent that
uniformity of decisions will be quite
impracticable. A taxpayer should know,
by consulting the law, what his obliga-
tions or liabilities are, not depend on
some whim or discretionary powers of
whoever may assess his income tax
return.
Discretionary powers under the old
Act were considered to be too wide.
But they are mild compared with the
new Bill.
Purchase of tax losses
Research director of the Federated
Taxpayers’ Associations of Australia, Mr
John McKellar White, feels very strongly
about this: “Everybody has the greatest
admiration for the Commissioner of Tax-
ation, a highly placed man of integrity.
But the powers of discretion are not his
alone. Obviously they are going to be
exercised by subordinate officers and
open to wide interpretation. The Bill
doesn’t give any real criterion as to the
manner in which this discretion should
be exercised. From a practical point of
view it looks as if it could be abused.”
An important feature of the Bill is the
section relating to tax losses. The losses
in future will not be allowed as an
offset against income unless the holders
of 40 p.c. of the shares are the same in
the loss year as they were in a profit
year. Under the old law there is no
percentage holding set down for public
companies, though for private companies
■25 p.c. of control and ownership must
be the same in profit and loss years.
What about the situation where a
company entered into contractual obli-
gations to purchase loss companies and
was obliged to outlay large sums to
complete those contractual obligations?
The purchaser must shoulder all cur-
rent and future commitments yet not
gain any further benefit after the 1964-
65 financial year.
The Ligertwood Committee strongly
recommended, when dealing with re-
coupment of losses, that certain sections
of the old Tax Act be repealed, but
the Committee recommended that there
be no requirement that 25 p.c. of the
shareholding of a company must be held
beneficially in each year that tax losses
are claimed. Not only has the Govern-
ment failed to adopt the recommendation
of the Ligertwood Committee it has
increased the percentage from 25 p.c.
to 40 p.c.
Also, under the old system, it was
commonplace for 75 p.c. of capital of a
loss company to be acquired by purchase
and for an option to be given in respect
of the remaining 25 p.c. of the capital.
This meant that, when losses had been
finally recouped by profits, the option
over the remaining 25 p.c. of capital
would be exercised. Options are now
out. Under the new proposals, options
are treated as a straight purchase, so
this completely shelves recoupment of
losses by private companies where loss
companies have been taken over.
If the Government wants to do that
sort of thing, the amendment should
date from the time of the announcement
and not be made retroactive, says one
tax consultant.
Here is a breath-taking example of the
wide powers of “discretion” given under
Section 80, dealing with losses of public
and private companies. Discretion can
be used “if the Commissioner is satis-
fied that it is reasonable to assume
something.” Assume what? That the
company is making too much money?
That the directors are taking advantage
of the law?
A noted user of tax losses is Osti
Holdings Ltd, the Sydney manufacturer
of lingerie and dresses. It has minimised
its tax payments by using tax losses. In
the past three years it has paid a total
of £11,981 tax on total earnings of
£463,460. It still has £lBO,OOO in avail-
able tax losses outstanding. These should
be absorbed in the current year, giving


FOOHEYS LTD
The chairman, the Hon R. C. Wilson, CMG, addressed shareholders at
the annual meeting held in Sydney on Wednesday, October 28, 1964.
Mr Wilson said:
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I welcome you all to this meeting.
During the past fortnight we sent
you the Directors’ Report and
Annual Accounts and I am sure you
were pleased with them. This has been
a good year for the Company, as
shown by the results. I would like to
draw your attention to some of the
“highlights” in the report.
Financial Results:
You will remember that in 1961 we
embarked on a major re-organisation,
and this has proved most successful.
Last year we showed improved profits
and this year our profit is higher again.
In fact it is £59,000 better, which
means an improvement of 8.6% even
after considerable increases of taxation
have been taken off. A comparison of
Consolidated Profits of the two years,
on a fully tax paid basis, shows an
effective increase of nearly £129,000
or 21%.
The increase in our volume of sales,
coupled with further improvements in
our efficiency, has achieved this in-
creased profitability in spite of higher
income tax, higher rates and taxes, and
increased wages, on top of which we
must remember the wholesale price of
beer has not risen.
We maintain the very high quality
of our products; we endeavour to keep
service to our customers at the highest
possible standard, and at the same
time we are consolidating and expand-
ing our outlets and increasing our
production facilities. Because of this,
our progress continues despite strong
competition.
Modernisation and Expansion:
During the year, as already shown
in the Directors’ Report, we have been
active in the modernisation and expan-
sion of the Company’s hotels. The
new Antler Parkway Hotel-Motel at
French’s Forest, an attractive structure
with ample facilities for car parking,
came into operation in the early part of
the financial year. Results have been
pleasing and justify the expenditure
involved.
The Royal Antler Hotel at Narra-
been has been extensively remodelled
with modern cocktail lounge and bar
areas and plenty of space for car
parking. This hotel will now provide
amenities long overdue in meeting the
heavy demand in the district.
Towards the close of the year we
purchased the Mainsbridge Hotel at
Liverpool, the centre of a densely
populated and rapidly expanding area.
This acquisition is a valuable addi-
tion to the Company’s freehold out-
lets.
Complete rebuilding is being carried
out at two other hotels. These are
the Speers Point Hotel at Speers Point,
a holiday resort on Lake Macquarie,
and the Aurora Hotel at Surry Hills
in the industrial area close to Central
Station.
Alterations have also been under-
taken at a number of other Company
hotels during the year, including sub-
stantial remodelling and additions to
the Gladesville and Lidcombe Hotels.
It will be readily appreciated that
projects of this nature, together with
the necessity to expand production
facilities to meet the growing demand
for our products, involve considerable
financial outlay.
Although much of the improvement
work we have done this year has been
confined to the Sydney area we are
not overlooking the demands of the
country, and here let me say that our
brewery at Grafton has again made a
satisfactory contribution to group pro-
fits. The brewery’s work has expanded
and we are very proud of the pro-
ducts it is turning out. We must re-
member, too, that the majority of
Tooheys’ freehold hotels are located
in the country and more than half of
our products consumed in the country.
We would like to see a first-class
Tooheys hotel situated in every im-
portant town in New South Wales
serviced by the Company. This was
one of the big reasons for your Board’s
initial interest in Coach House Motor
Inns Ltd. It gave us a good hotel in
six centres: Parkes, Cowra, Canberra,
Cooma, Thredbo and Deniliquin. Of
course, the providing of accommoda-
tion in country areas and, in fact,
in city areas as well has proved
difficult in the last few years. The
Coach House Motor Inns did not
escape this difficulty, but now, with
these directly under Tooheys’ control,
we think they are giving good service,
and since May when we took them
over they are certainly proving more
profitable.
New Hotels:
Continuing our improvement work,
we plan during 1965 to rebuild the
Wells Hotel at Tweed Heads, the
Imperial Hotel at Walgett. the Im-
perial Hotel at Nyngan, and the Com-
mercial Hotel at Werris Creek. In
addition, we plan major reconstruc-
tion of the Canobolas Hotel at Orange
and a new motel wing on the Royal
Hotel at Bourke. as well as new hotels
in the outer suburban area of Doon-
side and at Dickson in Canberra,
A.C.T.
All this is in addition to the usual
maintenance work we carry out on our
numerous hotels and the improving
and modernising which must take place
all the time in a brewery.
This work, of course, needs money
quite a lot of it in these days of
high costs. As you will see from the
Accounts, we have taken £200,000 from
the profits of the year and have trans-
ferred this to a Reserve for Plant and
Property Development, and I know
that you will agree this is a wise thing
to do.
As I said before, our profits in the
last two years have shown quite a
dramatic increase. The profit in 1961
was, in round figures, £422,000; in 1962
it was £394,000; in 1963, £687,000; and
now in 1964 it is £746,000 in spite of
increased costs and taxes, and without
any increase in the wholesale price of
beer.
The Dividend:
Why then, you may ask, with these
increased profits, is the dividend still
held at 8% and not increased to 9%
which was the rate for some years
in the past? This is a matter which
has had a great deal of consideration
from your Directors.
Whilst the rate of dividend was re-
duced two years ago from 9% to 8%,
the actual amount of dividend has,
of course, been increased, occasioned
by the conversion to capital in Feb-
ruary, 1962, of £2.4 million of con-
vertible notes. In 1961 the dividend at
9% took £358,000. Today, at 8%, it
takes £529,000.
Apart from this, I think you will
agree with me that the prosperity of
the Shareholders in Tooheys lies in
the prosperity of the Company.
Tooheys prospers and progresses when
it keeps its brewery up to date and
its hotels and accommodation and its
bars and lounges up to today’s modern
standards and, in fact, requirements.
In addition, we must plan and develop,
with an eye to our growth in the
future.
The cost of the 8% dividend we
recommend, as I said, is £529,000. To
increase it to 9% would cost an extra
£66,000. I can assure you that the
Directors will watch this question of
increasing the dividend all the time.
They want to give an adequate return
to Shareholders but they want to make
Tooheys stronger and more prosperous
so that this may be achieved.
The Staff:
Finally, I want to refer to the Com-
pany’s executive and staff. The Board is
very proud of them and of the results
they are achieving. We have a good
General Manager and a staff with
ability and enthusiasm working as one
unit for the benefit of Tooheys. I
know you will want me to thank them
one and all for the work they have
done.
I now have pleasure in moving:
that the Report, Balance Sheet and
Profit and Loss Account as presented
be adopted:
that the payment of the Interim Divi-
dend on 30th April last be confirmed;
and
that the Final Dividend as recom-
mended be declared.

it a clean slate to start business when
purchased tax losses are not accepted
after June 30, 1964. Deputy chairman
of Osti, Mr E. J. Kirby, said he didn’t
think the company would be using tax
losses in future. “These amendments will
mean that no company can buy another
company purely for tax loss purposes.
“To buy a company after it has
shown a loss will be worthless because
of this provision about 40 p.c. of con-
trol and ownership. With private com-
panies the position will be difficult but
with public companies it will be almost
impossible, even if they are purchased
in a profit year, to use them after a
loss year because there could well be a
complete alteration of control and
ownership in those two years.
“No, you won’t see a loss company
being purchased purely to offset income
tax again. It's too much of a gamble.”
Family trusts
Many professional men are concerned
about the provisions of the Bill relating
to the establishment and taxing of trusts.
Under the old tax law, income tax can
be minimised by forming trusts, usually
for children. Provided the income of
these trusts does not exceed £2OB a year,
income tax need not be paid.
A new provision of a 10s. in the £
tax under special provisions is aimed to
prevent a series of trusts being estab-
lished to avoid income tax. A company
lawyer said he felt this was an unfair
imposition on people who had “done
the right thing”.
Partnerships
A partner in a legal firm said he was
in favor of the measures on partnerships.
Partners lacking control of shares in the
partnership will be heavily penalised.
They will be taxed at their own personal
rate of income, or 10s. in £, whichever
is higher. “This will mean a lot of non-
shareholding partners will be forced to
buy an interest in their business, thus
making the partnership more equitable
for all concerned.”
Superannuation funds
A tax expert said that while the
amendments are belated “most people
would support the Government’s closure
of loopholes in the present tax laws.
Particularly good are those relating to
trusts and superannuation schemes. A
lot of people have been fiddling super-
annuation funds to get tax-free savings
rather than provide superannuation for
their employees and relatives. Now that
they will be subject to tax on income
derived from private company dividends,
the schemes will be more equitable for
the employees. But the real worth of
the Bill lies in the fact that generally, it
will not penalise those who have con-
ducted their affairs legitimately.”

MARKET POINTERS
Tougher for Manufacturers
Effects of the British trade measures
An important aspect of Britain’s new
export drive is that overseas
branches or subsidiaries may expect the
UK parent company to encroach on
local sales, if practicable. Tax rebates
introduced by the Wilson Labor Govern-
ment may encourage some revision of
markets and, if the parent sees that it
can export a cheaper article, it could
reallocate some manufacturing arrange-
-ments.
There would need to be some reason-
able profit incentive to do this, however,
as no parent company would want to
ups:t the development of an overseas
subsidiary which involved a large capi-
tal investment when initially established.
Electrical appliances, always a fluctu-
ating. competitive market, could come in
for review. Plessey, in which Austra-
lian shareholders now have an interest
through the Ducon takeover, may gain
more attention.
★ ★ ★
TTanimex, which has achieved buoyant
sales overseas, was forced to sit up
and take notice when the new 15 p.c.
UK import tax was announced. Peter
McConachie, secretary of Hanimex, had
left already to promote marketing acti-
vities of Hanimex subsidiaries in Canada
and the UK, so the new tax must come
as a bit of a shock. The UK subsidiary
makes valuable contributions to profit
and Hanimex last year spent £8949 in
having its own shares listed on the Lon-
don Stock Exchange. About 5 p.c. of
the capital is held by UK stockholders.
Fortunately, the Hanimex business is
widespread but big things were expected
of the UK subsidiary. If the UK tax is
only temporary, the Hanimex subsidiary
could get by.

manufacturers now look-
ing towards a more competitive
world market can see the advantages of
going into partnership with locals in
such countries as Malaysia. Any
general world tightening of import con-
trols, despite that it may be contrary to
the spirit of GATT, could benefit those
who have a leg in other countries.
ACI comes to mind as a centipede
with plenty of legs.
★ ★ ★
very successful A ppleton lndus-
A tries, whose UK subsidiary as-
sembles glass louvre windows from com-
ponents sent from Australia, also could
be affected by the UK import tax.
Appleton’s activities are widespread,
however, and it already has proved it
can open up new markets.
★ ★ ★
¥l7’ine exports, already encountering tax
" problems in UK markets, could
find the going even more difficult, while
finished goods of all descriptions, in-
cluding novelties, fur toys, leather goods,
etc., all come under the manufacturing
label which qualifies for the new tax.
★ ★ ★
'P'xporters of leacl-zinc, copper, etc.,
have no immediate worries, as they
are exporting raw materials. The only
problem is if demand falls for such
items. On the other hand, if the UK
Government’s plans succeed in boosting
manufacturing activities, there will be
increased usage of base metals.

Speech of Sir Robert- Webster (Chairman) to Stockholders at the

held on Friday, 30th October, 1964, at 12 noon.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Last year I referred to the steadily
improving conditions then being experi-
enced and mentioned that we had
reached a stage where most of our major
production units had returned to three
shift operation, and that indications were
for further improvements in the months
immediately ahead. This forecast proved
to be correct.
I am pleased to say that throughout
the financial year, as progressively sec-
tions of our operations came into full
production, earnings improved steadily.
The second half of the financial year has
been one of sound and satisfactory pro-
gress, which has continued into the first
quarter of the present year.
When it is recalled that during the
period of the credit squeeze we dis-
missed nearly 1,000 of our trained
people, it is satisfactory to know that for
the year ended 30th June, 1964, the gross
profit, before tax, was £843,099, with
a net profit after tax of £542,623
an improvement of the after tax profit
of 36% on the previous year in spite
of the increased tax rate.
A YEAR OF CONSOLIDATION
I also made reference last year to
the benefits flowing from the modernising
of spinning mills in Victoria and NSW,
and the improved productivity accom-
panied by very substantial reductions in
the prices for cotton yarns. We are con-
tinuing to derive the maximum benefits
from these mills.
Some further small advances have
been made during the current year in
respect to productivity and costs of pro-
duction. Whilst we will still continue to
obtain some small gains in productivity
during the period ahead they will be
only relatively small as we have already
reaped the full benefits from the new
equipment with its greater productive
capacity and increased work loads.
Our Fine Spinning Mill at Kotara,
which had been confronted with unusual-
ly heavy stocks of imported yarn of the
type we are set up to produce in that
mill, gradually received more and more
support from local users. This mill has
been operating for some months now on
a full three shift basis with improving
productivity as the work force becomes
more efficient. This yarn is being sold
at substantially lower prices than the
imported duty free price at the time
the decision was made to enter this
field of production.
It was gratifying to have the Minister
for Trade and Industry, The Hon. John
McEwen, officially open this mill on
2nd October. More than 200 guests
attended the function and also took the
opportunity of spending the morning of
the same day inspecting the operations
of our plants at Rutherford.
The visitors were enthusiastic about
what they saw and expressed not only
their interest but surprise at the extent
of the operations.
Many leading business executives were
present. They did not need to be textile
men to be able to understand and appre-
ciate in a general way the value of
what they saw from a National point of
view or to understand that they were
seeing well organised and efficient mills.
Our campaign for the production and
marketing of Bradmill sheets and sheet-
ing met with success and this section of
our plant is busily engaged in turning
out a range of quality products which
are finding ready market acceptance.
Our plants which specialise in the
manufacture of cotton drills and denims
and such fabrics, although now in the
main on a three shift basis, are still
working on very narrow margins of profit
or in a few instances without profit at
all.
In this field of our activities we are
still manufacturing fabrics for which
there has been no increase in price for
many years. The Governments, both
State and Commonwealth, have benefited
from these circumstances. In common
with other cotton textile manufacturers
we have tendered for supply of material
at prices below the cost of production
rather than allow our equipment to be-
come idle.
TARIFFS
I wish to say something about tariff
protection. I have always maintained
that under comparative conditions there*
is every reason why the Australian
Cotton Textile Industry can hold its
own with overseas competitors from the
point of view of equipment, work loads
and technical skills. Any disadvantages
that may confront the industry because
of the smaller population and the need
to produce a wide range of goods for
this relatively small population are not
problems peculiar to Australia. These
are problems which also apply to other
countries.
It would be a rare thing, if indeed it
is possible at all, to find an industry
which has had to face the ups and downs
and setbacks which we have had to face
over the years. Changes which have to
be faced due to economic conditions
which affect all industries can be handled
by a well organised company in a satis-
factory way and we must always expect


that from time to time there will be a
lessening in prosperity and a falling off
in demand for our goods; but we will
never have an opportunity of reaching
maximum efficiency whilst importers can
find ways of getting around protective
duties. Nobody can blame importers for
this. There is nothing illegal about it,
but the severity of the effect on the tex-
tile manufacturer is none the less for
that.
What we do complain about is that
it should be possible for this to hap-
pen, that the circumstances are such as
to permit the defeating of both the policy
of the Government and the intention of
the Tariff Board.
In addition to the battle to maintain
satisfactory protection on current produc-
tion, the industry sought a somewhat
better share of the market in order to
permit of the whole industry operating
their mills to full capacity, or as near
as possible to that desirable state of
affairs. Australian weavers are only mak-
ing 14% to 16% of the cotton piece-
goods consumed in Australia. Against
this we are importing 360,000,000 square
yards of cotton piecegoods (which in
recent times included 144,000,000
square yards from Japan, representing
44% of our total requirements). Our
request is surely modest and not un-
reasonable.
It is almost a year ago since the
Tariff Board opened an Inquiry into the
rates of protective duties which should
be applied to cotton piecegoods and
man-made fibre piecegoods of the kind
we are set up to produce. This refer-
ence covered the whole range of the
materials we now make and some which
we do not produce, but which we can
make on idle capacity available in Aus-
tralia.
We believe that the Tariff Board and
the Government are aware that the big-
gest handicap our industry has to face
is the stopping and starting which occurs
when we are subjected to unreasonable
competition from countries whose prices
are often not related to costs of manu-
facture.
On the question of full employment,
this must be said for the Textile industry.
We are, in the main, a decentralised
industry; Bradford Cotton Mills Limited
itself has mills in country areas in
Queensland, New South Wales and Vic-
toria. It is true to say that the activities
of Bradford Cotton Mills Limited have
provided, and continue to provide, jobs
in country towns where otherwise there
would still be many unemployed, in spite
of the fact that we have as a nation
reached a general state of full employ-
ment.
The theory that the work force will
move to the areas where jobs are avail-
able is only true in a very restricted
sense and in the more densely populated
areas. People have homes of their own
in the country areas. They have children
at school there.
The leaving of homes and the moving
of families to the areas where work is
available present problems apparently
not appreciated by those who advance
the theory of the work force following
the jobs.
It has to be borne in mind also that
in these decentralised industries we are
employing large numbers of females,
and in spite of the conditions of full
employment there are many of them
still looking for work in the areas in
which we have our mills. They also, for
very obvious reasons, do not want to
leave their homes to go to other centres
where they have to find accommodation
and work apart from their families.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT
You have received a copy of the
Thirty-Seventh Annual Report of the
Directors and the accounts for the year
ended 30th June, 1964.
As already announced, the aggregate
net trading profit of Bradford Cotton
Mills Limited and its subsidiary com-
panies was £843,099 before tax and the
net profit after tax was £542,623.
During the year the value of addi-
tions to fixed assets amounted to
£336,257. Total value of fixed assets
at cost is now £15,870,953, against
which provision for depreciation amounts
to £6,020,350, including depreciation
written off in this year amounting to
£648,611. Much of the plant is com-
pletely written down, but a substantial
part of it is almost new and is there-
fore carrying a high cost for deprecia-
tion.
The value of stocks and stores is
higher by approximately £40,000 than
it was last year; almost entirely due to
the increased turnover and the necessity
for carrying higher stocks of raw
materials to meet our needs. Having
regard to the increased activity in all
mills, this is a satisfactory position. All
stocks have been completely and care-
fully valued.
Every effort is made to keep debtors
down to figures which might be regarded
as normal and satisfactory. It will be
noted, however, that these are higher
by £282,767, than at the end of the
previous year.
We believe adequate provision has
been made in the accounts for bad debts
and discounts and the effectiveness of
our credit control arrangements is indi-
cated by the fact that bad debts in-
curred and actually written off in the
year amounted to only £11,246.
Bank overdraft is slightly higher, but
our trade creditors are lower. The move-
ment in the combined overdraft figure,
plus creditors, being a reduction of
approximately £20,000 compared with
the previous year.
The financial statements deal with
other items quite clearly and the figures
do not seem to call for any further
comment, though I will be glad to
answer any questions which stockhold-
ers might care to ask.
THE ORGANISATION
The centralisation of the control of
marketing for all the company's pro-
ducts throughout Australia and the
streamlining of the basic functions of
marketing, manufacturing and finance
have worked successfully.
The changes, which in some instances
involved rearrangement and departure
from what had become established prac-
tices, have contributed materially to the
success which the company has experi-
enced.
BASIC WAGE INCREASE
With nearly 4,000 employees it will
be appreciated that the increase in the
basic wage, which carries with it an
increase in the proportion of incentive
payments, was a serious blow to industry
as a whole. Only a small proportion of
this increased cost has been recovered
by increasing prices. No increases have
been made for goods forming the major
part of our production.
We have been considerably assisted
in the carrying of this burden through the
benefits accruing from the greater pros-
perity of the country as the result of
which production and sales over those
of twelve months ago were substantially
increased.
The necessity for dismissing large
numbers of employees, of course, reduces
productivity considerably. It is never
possible to reduce the work force in
the same relation as the fall in produc-
tion. Valuable executives, supervisors,
technical staff and such like have usually
to be retained in almost their entirety,
otherwise the work of bringing plans
back into operation would be spread
over years.
Conversely therefore the productivity
and reduced costs improve out of relation
to the increased number of people em-
ployed as the mills come back into
production, but we still have to bear the
cost of retraining operatives not previous-
ly employed.
There is, of course, a limit to the
extent to which added costs can be
absorbed. In this respect industry does
not differ in any way from Government
enterprises and utilities operated by
Municipal authorities, in which areas it
is always found that price increases
accompany wage increases or alterna-
tively serious losses are incurred, which
would soon close up industries owned
and operated by private enterprises.
In July this year we heard. w : th great
regret, of the death of Mr. S. M. Wre-
ford. He joined the Board of Bradford
Cotton Mills Limited in December. 1953,
and remained with us until January,
1961, when for health reasons he resign-
ed. His experience and his wise counsel
contributed much to the successful opera-
tion of the company.
Executives and staff have given effi-
cient and loyal service during a neriod
which has not been without its d:fficul-
ties and on behalf of the Board of Direc-
tors and myself I express a*vn r ec>ation
for their loyalty, valuable work and co-
operation.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Another for Mr Rylah
Questions on Automotive Components
It may be unwise to judge a book by
its cover, but certain developments at
the annual meeting of Automotive Com-
ponents last week gave investors cause
to ask further questions about the acti-
vities of the company’s directors. The
chairman, Mr K. F. Manion, disclosed
that Sir Thomas Ritchie had resigned as
a member of the board. He then re-
vealed that himself and Mr G. H. Blax-
land would not seek re-election by the
meeting.
These resignations tie in very uncom-
fortably with the fact that the same
three men, between June 30 and Septem-
ber 9, sold 41,000 shares which were
under their control for an average price
of around 9s. It so happens that June 30
is the company’s balance date and that
September 9 is the day the annual re-
sults were released. These revealed a
heavy profit setback and dividend cut—■
the shares are currently selling for only
about ss. 6d.
As the final result was a far cry from
the interim report for the December six
months (sales up 10 p.c., prospects “en-
couraging”), the Melbourne Stock Ex-
change instigated an investigation to find
out why. On Monday of last week, the
Exchange revealed that its findings had
been passed on to the Attorney-General,
who had also called for a report on the
share dealings. Whether or not the
company was aware of this situation is
uncertain.
On the face of it, all this evidence
appeared very damning. To make mat-
ters worse, shareholders were not given
any explanation nor told of any plans
to fill the vacancies at the meeting. At
the time of going to press, explanations
for the resignations are still non-existent.
Only two members are left on the board.
So shareholders are at present feeling
justifiably indignant. Although Mr Man-
ion explained the discrepancy between
the interim and final reports quite ade-
quately (stock miscalculations were the
basic trouble), the question of the direc-
tors’ share sales remains an unresolved
business. Mr Rylah may shed some light
on the matter before long.
EMI Loves Liverpool
T)robably the first, and last, Austra-
lian public company to include The
Beatles in its annual report (in a favor-
able light) is EMI (Australia) Ltd. It
must love them, although you could
hardly imagine the board softly hum-
ming “yeah, yeah, yeah” before chair-
man John M. Burnett addressed the
annual meeting.
While he did not directly attribute the
increase in gramophone record sales
(8,187,000 to 9,082,000 units in 1963-
64) directly to the Liverpool group, he
makes a detailed reference to them say-
ing “Your company is fortunate in
having pressing and marketing rights in
this country for many of the prominent
artists in this (“Liverpool sound”) field.
More importantly, Mr Burnett points
out that the market for television re-
ceivers (“the largest element in your
company’s turnover”) has levelled out.
The industry production for the year
totalled 271,000 receivers as against
1962-63’s output of 292,000. He warns,

though, that “the marketing of this pro-
duct continues to be beset by the funda-
mental problem of an industry’s produc-
tive capacity being well in excess of
consumer demand.” The Bulletin
feels that this situation is likely to con-
tinue, as the demand for television re-
ceivers could never reasonably be ex-
pected to regain 1959-60's record level
of 435,300.
EMI turned over approximately as
many domestic radio receivers in 1963-
64 as it did the previous year. Particu-
larly strong competition in this field
comes from overseas products, which
enter the country as imports or travel-
lers’ personal effects. Mr Burnett men-
tions the local industry’s protests to the
Government about the number of tran-
sistor radios entering the country in this
way. He does not mention, however,
that travellers entering Australia now are
allowed to bring in only one transis-
tor radio duty free—a new customs law
recently decreed.
As previously reported EMl’s profit
rose 7 p.c. to £438,153 in the year to
June 30. It was still, however, well
below 1960’s record £541,808.
Tariff Doubts
Tn Melbourne last week, two companies
to which cheap imports provide a
considerable threat Woolcord Fab-
rics and Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills pointed out the considerable
difficulties facing them because of the
attractive nature of the Australian
market to many overseas manufacturers.
The common theme behind their state-
ments to shareholders was the indication
that tariffs were still too low to prevent
.excessive imports, because many over-
seas firms established special prices for
the Australian market.
Mr Raymont Moore, Woolcord’s
chairman, said nothing was being done
to prevent the influx of furnishing fab-
rics and, in many cases, imports were
deliberately priced to undercut local pro-
duction costs. “Our staff is as skilful
and efficient as its overseas counterparts,
and our equipment is up-to-date. But
our efforts continue to be nullified be-
cause of the special export practices by
overseas manufacturers, and, in some in-
stances, Government assistance by way
of subsidy”.
In their annual report, APPM direct-
ors had doubts whether the new paper
tariffs would give adequate protection.
They said some manufacturers were still
quoting special prices for the Australian
market. Scandinavian firms had in-
creased prices to most markets except
Australia. New suppliers were also
showing interest. Mainland China, for


KAY CORPORATION LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Your Directors have pleasure in presenting their Second Report which covers the twelve months
ended 30th June, 1964 together with a Profit and Loss Account for the same period and the Balance Sheet
as at 30th June, 1964.
The balance brought forward from last year (after providing for Consolidated Parent.
payment of a final dividend and making adjustments for tax,
etc.) was £20,989 £11,634
To which is added Net Profit for the year after providing for :
Income Tax 33,471 19,504
54,460 31,138
From which the following dividends have been paid or are
payable:
5% interim dividend paid 31st March, 1964 £15,000
4% final dividend payable 27th October, 1964 12,000 27,000 27,000
Leaving a balance of accumulated unappropriated profits
carried forward i £27,460 £4,138
Trading Conditions. Rent-A-Car
The Company’s net profit has been materially affected
this year by heavy first year depreciation and other charges
debited in the accounts in accordance with the stated policy
of the Board. As a result of its fully serviced vehicle fleet
on lease to business organisations increasing by 46 per cent,
and on daily hire (Kays Rent-A-Car) to the general public
by 35 per cent., depreciation charged in the accounts for the
year ended 30th June, 1964 was £325,849 compared with
£196,547 for the previous year.
Since the Company entered business it has always
approached the problem of depreciation on a conservative
basis, writing off 30% p.a. on the reducing balance. This
results in the total depreciation for the normal two year
lease term representing 51% of cost; 30% being written off
in the first year and 21% in the second year.
Thus at any time when the Company has vehicles
available for disposal it is in a position whereby it is assured
against loss, and in fact, experience has shown that in
effectively every case, a profit is realised to the Group on
sale.
In times of rapid expansion, such a policy, whilst
clearly to the Company’s long term benefit, does adversely
affect its results, as rental income is received by equal
amounts paid monthly over the term of the lease. The
Board has considered this problem from time to time but
has, for the present, decided not to alter its established
policy.
Freehold Properties.
A property located at Footscray was sold at a capital
profit during the year. A two storey building adjoining the
Company’s present Rent-A-Car office at 254-260 Latrobe
Street, Melbourne, was purchased during the year. It will
provide accommodation for staff comprising the Group’s
head office administration and in addition is expected to be
a valuable acquisition for expansion in the years to come.
Our turnover in recent months has shown large gains
over the corresponding previous periods, and these increases
have come from an ever widening list of clients, both
business houses and private individuals.
It is our belief that our services should be rendered
at the lowest practicable cost to our customers, yet we have
been criticised for reducing our Rent-A-Car charges.
Nevertheless this policy has proved beneficial both to our
customers and to your company; and we expect it will
improve profitability during the current trading period.
The company believes it has little to fear from its
present, or for that matter, prospective opposition in the
Rent-A-Car field.
During the year a new Branch was opened at Towns-
ville to meet the demand for the Company’s service in that
area as a result of increased tourism and industrial and
commercial developments. An additional Branch has been
opened in Canberra during the current financial year.
Shareholders should be informed that we now have
Branches in Townsville, Brisbane, Coolangatta, Sydney,
Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Launceston and
Devonport, and franchises at Perth, Kangaroo Island, Lae,
Port Moresby, Cairns, Mildura and Whyalla.
Industrial Land.
A proposition was made to the Company during the
year to develop twenty five acres of industrial zoned land
in Mcorabbin on a syndicate basis with the other party in
the syndicate providing finance for the development, but
your Company to be responsible for the management
thereof. At the time of the preparation of this Report more
than 40 per cent, of the blocks have been either sold or
reserved although the estate has only just been offered for
sale. It is anticipated that the project will prove to be very
profitable.
(Continued next page )


instance, had become an important
source for some fine papers and
specialised wrappings. Chinese sales are
made way below world prices.
In all these cases, directors said it
was difficult for the local company to
prove that dumping had taken place.
All’s fair in love and business. But
this apparent trend to special pricing
for Australia could develop into some-
thing quite serious. As long as overseas
firms are exporting favorably else-
where, they would not be disinclined to
initially forgo profits in Australia, where
the gaining of a foothold now must
reap substantial benefits in the expan-
sive years ahead. Interest thus attaches
to the outcome of “further inquiries”
which APPM directors say the “authori-
ties” are making.
It’s a Long Way ...
Oydney boilermaker and engineer
Ronald J. Murray Ltd, has finally
arrested the downturn in its profits and
has started along the slow road of re-
covery to pre-float levels. Listed in
November, 1960, its 1959-60 profit was
£26,173. First profit as a public com-
pany was £20,533. In 1961-62, earn-
ings slipped to £15,069 and in 1962-63
slumped to £5549.
Now comes an upturn to £7995. This
result was arrived at after tax of £4227
compared with £2872 the previous year.
Depreciation allowance is £5306 as
against £5206. On the increased earn-
ing rate of 4.7 p.c. (last year it was 3.2
p.c.) a 24 p.c. dividend is being paid for
the second time.
The market apparently still has doubts
about the company’s ability to get back
on solid ground for some time and is
keeping the ss. shares around 25., well
below their initial listing of 9s. 6d.
Busy Brickworks
"Drickworks Ltd is pretty much in an
unassailable position in Sydney,
holding about 47 p.c. of the trade in the
metropolitan area.
It indicates this after reporting that
the company is not concerned at the
possibility of a big rival group • starting
operations. Chairman and managing
director Mr W. K. Dawes told the
annual meeting demand was currently
in excess of production and the company
had a waiting list at every one of its
brickyards.
To help overcome this shortage, a
third kiln with a capacity of 400,000
bricks a week and costing £600,000 is
being installed. It is due to be com-
pleted in March next year. Mr Dawes
says that, while building activity is near-
ing record levels, it does not appear
that the Government can “afford to curb
the industry to any extent. Whilst some
action may be necessary to keep demand
within the reasonable capabilities of the
industry to supply materials and labor,
it is not expected that such action will
be of a drastic nature.”
In the year to June 30, Brickworks
earned a record profit of £385,122,
£97,848 higher than the previous re-
sult. Latest profit was earned after
nearly doubled tax of £327,953 and
£56,676 higher depreciation provision of
£282,289. Earning rate jumps to 22.6
p.c. from 15.8 p.c.
The little-traded 20s. shares are cur-
rently selling for about 745., where the
yield from the fourth consecutive 15 p.c.
dividend is 4 p.c.
Second Attempts
Statements in the annual report and
proceedings at the annual meeting
in Melbourne last week have verified
New Car Distributorship.
The Company has accepted appointment as distribu-
tors for Victoria and the Riverina for Mitsubishi Colt and
Isuzu Bellett cars and light commercial vehicles. Inter-
state distributors elsewhere in Australia have had very
heavy demands and have sold out supplies in most cases.
We expect this project to be under way late in 1964.
Liquid Position.
In considering the balance sheet, it is important to
bear in mind that, unlike some finance companies which
are able to bring in as an asset income which has yet to
mature, the company does not bring to account the income
due on the unexpired portion of leasing contracts which, at
30th June last, amounted to approximately £773,000.
Even allowing for this factor, it is clear that the main
problem facing the Company is one of liquid funds brought
about by the rapid expansion of what is, essentially, a
medium and long term business. The Directors have been
examining this problem for some time, and have now
arranged a preference share issue of £150,000 from a
private source which represents Australian and overseas
financial interests. Loan money will also be available from
the same source at competitive rates. The proceeds of the
issue will be used mainly to replace short term money at
present being used in the company. An Extraordinary
General Meeting of the Company is being called to approve
the new issue.
General.
Mr D. Benge resigned from the Board on the 30th June,
1964 to enter business on his own account. It is not
intended to fill the vacancy created by the resignation at
this stage.
Mr J. M. Joel retires in accordance with the Articles
of Association but is eligible for re-election and offers
himself accordingly.
Messrs. Smith, Johnson & Company retire as auditors
and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The Board once again would like to express its appre-
ciation of the full and loyal support received from the Com-
pany’s employees during the year.
To comply with statutory requirements, the Directors
state —
In their opinion the results of the year’s operations
have not been materially affected by items of an abnormal
nature, excepting matters disclosed in the accounts or in
this report;
No circumstances have arisen which render adherence
to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities
of the Company, misleading or inappropriate;
Since the end of the period covered by the last Report
no contingent liabilities have been undertaken by the Com-
pany other than an unlimited liability in respect of the bank
overdraft referred to in Note No. 1 to the Company’s
Balance Sheet. No contingent liability has become enforce-
able or is likely to become enforceable within the next
twelve months which will materially affect the Company
in its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall
due.
For and on behalf of the Board:
V. M. CORR
Chairman.
27th October, 1964.

that it may be some time before Second
Century regains its feet. The Bulletin
of September 19 (page 70) indicated
that such was the case in a story dis-
cussing the firm’s 1963-64 loss. Over-
capitalisation and poor earnings will pre-
vail until certain subsidiaries can be
expanded or more fully developed.
These subsidiaries are Colmax Elec-
tric and the Continental Instrument Co.
The group’s disastrous factoring activities
are being rapidly curtailed and no new
accounts are to be taken on.
Colmax operates a large electrical
contracting business from Melbourne,
with branches at Geelong, Moe, Can-
berra and Sydney. Further expansion is
planned, particularly in NSW. About
£90,000 has been ploughed into this
venture since June 30. Increased profits
are budgeted for the current year. The
chairman, Mr D. M. Ferguson, was not
prepared to tell shareholders what last
year’s profit was, despite direct question-
ing.
It is quite obvious, however, that the
efforts of this subsidiary will not pro-
vide profits which adequately service
capital especially if the instrument
company continues to make losses. It
became a subsidiary during the year,
and the £9,567 loss was anticipated at
acquisition. It is being treated as a
development cost.
Whether reasonable profits will ever
be earned is debatable. The subsidiary
has virtually only one possible money
spinner a new control mechanism
for self-service petrol pumps, supposedly
superior to anything else available.
Still Waiting
Shareholders of Drylec Ltd, NSW
Hoover products distributor, must
be anxiously awaiting the chairman’s
annual report (due late this month) to
find out what the company is going to
do when its Hoover franchise expires on
June 30, 1965. Hoover intends to un-
dertake its own distribution in NSW
and Victoria from that date.
Since the first mention of the termina-
tion of the franchise in June last year
the company’s board has given no indi-
cation of what its future activities will
be or even if the company will continue.
For this reason the market is quite justi-
fied in holding the ss. shares at about
6s. 6d., even though assets backing is
about 9s.
The market did not get excited about
the announcement of the profit improve-
ment of £3540 to £87,839. Earning
rate, due to a note conversion during
the year, slips from 21.2 p.c. to 19.3 p.c.
Tax provision was £54,104 (last year
£40,680) and depreciation £14,766
(£15,024). Dividend is steady at 12i p.c.
for the fourth successive year.


BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A Good Income Stock Only
Malcolm Moore depends on development works
“TpHE Malcolm Moore Organisation
-*■ manufactures and distributes an
extensive range of materials handling
plant and general engineering equip-
ment.” This is the official description
which the directors of Melbourne-based
Malcolm Moore Industries Ltd gave to
their company in the 1963-64 annual re-
port. Before any useful comment can
be made on the group’s past, present and
future, it is necessary to examine
exactly how “extensive” and how
“general” these activities really are.
The parent was formed in 1946 to
acquire Malcolm Moore Ltd. Today,
Australia-wide operations are carried
out through 19 offshoots. Four of these,
all Victorian-based, have established
the group as a leader in the engineering
field. Moore Crane and Engineering
turns out all types of cranes, including
“special purpose” ones, on top of its
general engineering work. Moore Con-
veyor produces a variety of conveyor
systems as well as structural steelwork
and general engineering. Moore Pro-
duction Tooling provides tools and main-
tains them along with a production con-
sulting service, production aids, jigs, dies,
gauges, fixtures and presses. Finally,
Moore Hydraulics manufactures hydrau-
lic pumps, valves, cylinders, motor hoses,
couplings, steering, power packs, hoists
and pipelines. So much for the engi-
neering side of the business.
HThen there is a road machinery group
A headed by Moore Road Machinery
(Aust.). ..It is the controller of the
Melbourne-based manufacturing unit
and six other subsidiaries which sell and
service the machinery in every State.
In this field, too, the company is a
leader, thanks mainly to a number of
valuable franchises held for the Austra-
lian distribution of English and Ameri-
can machinery. Of course, the local
company’s engineering facilities and
products have been important too, espe-
cially as far as percentage contributions
to profit are concerned. Equipment
dealt with by the eight companies
ranges widely from tractors and their
attachments, through bulldozers and
street sweepers, to railway trucks, indus-
trial locomotives, rock crushing and
bitumen plants.
Another important contributor in
recent years has been Moore Engineer-
ing (Cooma). This subsidiary was set
up in the mid-fifties solely to supply the
steel requisites (mostly tunnel supports
and reinforcements) of the Snowy
Mountains tunnelling contractors.
The six remaining offshoots are not
nearly as important to the group as the
foregoing and their three fields of acti-
vity. Incorporated in Victoria are
Moore Castings, Moore Farm Equip-
ment and Moore Acceptance Corpora-
tion. Power Farming Equipment is the
name given to two subsidiaries, one
NSW-based and one in Victoria. The
Esperance Construction Company, regis-
tered in WA, completes the list.
Between them, these 19 offshoots also
manufacture and/or distribute, under
licence, the products of five UK com-
panies and 15 US organisations. Among
the better known ones, in the UK, are
the Ford company and Vickers Arm-
strong. The US list includes Mack
Trucks, FWD Wagner, Char-Lynn and
Warner & Swasey.
All subsidiaries are at present working
to capacity and distribution facilities are
being gradually expanded. The vital
engineering companies have already
booked large contracts and big volume
orders in excess of last year’s operations.
This means the 1964-65 year will pro-
bably break the record sales and profits
which were achieved in 1963-64. Fluc-
tuations in engineering activities have
been the main cause of profit ups and
downs in recent years, especially in 1961
when poor conditions in the motor and
agricultural industries affected, in par-
ticular, work available for the hydraulic
and tooling offshoots.
The crane and conveyor companies
tend to be more stable, however. Crane
production managed to weather the poor
1961 and 1962 years very effectively and
brought the group extra benefits by
making use of the export incentive
scheme through selling cranes to New
Zealand.
The profitability of the road
machinery sector depends to an even
larger extent than engineering on general
economic conditions. Unfortunately, it
is also the sector where most of the
group's resources are placed. In the
early months of the credit squeeze,
directors described the sales as “negli-
gible”. Once the initial pressures were
eased, renewed buying by Government
departments and contractors started a
recovery. Directors have described the
current demand for road machinery as
high and increasing.
The current year looks just as bright
for the Cooma subsidiary as it does for
engineering and road machinery. Profits
are dictated entirely by the programme
of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric
Authority. The 1963-64 year proved
satisfactory and, at present, capacity
work is going on for the main contrac-
tors on the Jindabyne project. The life
of this subsidiary is obviously limited.
Directors have therefore decided to start
writing off the freehold property at
Cooma and £25,000 was allocated from
profits in 1963-64 to this end.
all this discussion, it can be
fairly concluded that Malcolm
Moore’s fortunes depend directly on gen-
eral economic conditions and the pro-
gress of national development works.
These two factors, in their turn, depend
on, and are affected by, each other.
Their apparent trends and interaction
will go a long way in showing investors
what the future performance of Mal-
colm Moore will be like.
The 1964-65 year measures up well
on this basis. The company has had no
labor problems as yet and, thanks to a
financial position which is the strongest
since 1946, the pressures being exerted
by the Reserve Bank are of little worry.
Of course, there is always the possibility
that Governments will start to curb
their capital works projects if things look
like getting out of hand. This seems un-
likely at present.
To quote Mr H. F. Walsh, chairman
of the six-strong board: “The current
year has opened exceedingly well and
business in every division is buoyant.
In particular I would mention that we
have already booked orders of a value
of some £750,000 in Queensland. I
mention this to bring to your notice the
industrial development that is evident in
the current advance of the State of
Queensland. This year we have again
budgeted for higher profits and with the
incidence of full and higher taxation we
should again better our net profit and
at least hold the current rate of divi-
dend. For the period to date profits are
in line with this budget.”
So everything looks rosy. Apparently
the cessation of tax loss benefits will not
hinder profit growth to any serious ex-
tent. There even seems to be a remote
possibility for an increased dividend to
shareholders. If such was the case, the
20s. shares would prove to be an even
better income-earning prospect than they
are now. Current prices at about 235.
would yield an investor a healthy 64 p.c.,
after brokerage, from the 8 p.c. divi-
dend.
The shares should not be considered
for any purpose other than income. And
even then a close watch must be kept
for any profit setbacks, as they could
well entail dividend cuts because of the

mediocre earning rate —13 p.c. in 1963-
64, the best since 1955-56 when 14.7
p.c. was earned. These low and fluctu-
ating earnings have also made issue pos-
sibilities virtually non-existent since
1955-56, when the last one was made,
a one-for-one at par.
The amount of capital on hand for
expansion will be the main determinant
of the likelihood of an issue. As the
accompanying table shows, there is no
lack of liquid funds at present, with
working capital sitting at around
£l£ million.
The accompanying table reveals no-
thing of any great significance. Fixed
assets are maintaining a steady trend.
A buoyant year has finally enabled in-
tangibles to be written back. Reserves
have grown steadily except for 1962,
when the dividend was uncovered. The
loan capital raised in 1962 is being eli-
minated at a reasonable rate. Profit,
dividend and share prices have all re-
covered to pre-squeeze levels.
R. B. DAVIES INDUSTRIES LTD
High Productive Levels
T>. B. Davies Industries Ltd was able
to meet the challenge of higher costs
and a shortage of labor in 1963-64 by
the installation of additional labor-saving
equipment during the year.
As a result, production showed a con-
siderable increase. Profit for the year
was almost a record. The programme
is still being actively pursued and is only
limited by the company’s capacity to
manufacture or purchase special dies and
tools for use in new plant.
R. B. Davies was formed in 1947 to
control a group of companies associated
with R. B. Davies Pty Ltd. This operating
company began in 1923 as a manu-
facturers’ agent, handling mainly builders’
hardware. At the end of 1929 it began
the manufacture of a number of items
previously imported.
Stock Exchange listing was obtained in
1950, following an issue of shares to
vendors of a number of associated com-
panies and an issue of 100,000 20s. ordin-
ary shares to the public at par. Paid-up
capital on listing was £437,210.
In the years to 1955, growth of capital
was fairly rapid, although shareholders
participated in only one issue, a one-for-
four in 1952. The remainder of the shares
were issued for takeovers. Paid-up capital
has been unchanged since 1955, at
£701,682.
The company has traded profitably
each year since listing, though earnings
have fluctuated fairly widely. Best year
was in 1957-58, when profit was £83,801,
equal to 11.9 p.c. on capital. In 1961-62,
profit fell to £42,485, equal to only 6.1
p.c. on capital, and giving scant cover to
the reduced dividend.
Similarly, dividend payments have
fluctuated, ranging between 6 p.c. and
9 p.c. Last year’s payment of 10 p.c. was
the first time the company had made
a distribution of this size.
Although Sydney-based, the company
is active in all States. It has its main
office and works at Marrickville in Syd-
ney and two factories in Melbourne. In
1959 it extended its activities to New
Zealand by the takeover of an existing
company. Despite early difficulties in this
country, the subsidiary has continued to
expand production and sales.
The group covers a wide range of
activities. Its principal lines cover the
hardware needs of cabinet makers, such
as hinges, knobs, locks, etc. Other activi-
ties include the manufacture of industrial
handling equipment, overhead cranes,
and engineering plant and equipment.
The company also has an interest in the
plastics industry, for one of its sub-
sidiaries makes a wide range of plastic
items for the hardware trade.
Operations in the past three years have
not been easy because of the slump in
the building industry. From a near record
£75,994 earned in 1959-60, the profit
fell in the next two years to £42,485
and dividend was cut from 9 p.c. to
6 p.c. The main cause was the falling-off
in turnover and the increased competition
for the available business. Business began
to pick up towards the end of the 1962
financial year and in 1962-63 profit
made a strong recovery to £60,903, equal
to 8.7 p.c. on capital, and dividend was
raised to 7 p.c.
In the latest year, turnover received a
solid boost as home building accelerated.
Profit for the year rose to £80,866, equal
to 11.6 p.c. on capital. Dividend was
hoisted to 10 p.c.
The subsidiary, Consolidated Hi-Lift
Hoists Pty Ltd, incurred a loss during the
year. Steps have been taken to market
its products, together with the chain
blocks and hoists manufactured by the
recently acquired Australian Block and
Chain Co., through Davies Industrial
Equipment, which should result in a
considerable saving in overhead. The
Australian Block and Chain acquisition
was financed by the issue of 98,318
shares and a cash payment.
The latest accounts, made up to June
30, show the company well placed to
handle additional business expected in
the current year, but getting rather low
on liquid funds. Since balance date, the
company has made a private issue to
institutions of £250,000 in unsecured
notes, carrying 71 p.c. interest.
At balance date, trade debtors were
£38,642 higher at £221,225, while stock
was up from £761,313 to £963,818.
Much of this increase was financed by an
increase in bank overdraft from £344,340
to £490,602. At June 30 the company
had unsecured notes for £42,700, carry-
ing 8 p.c. interest on issue and maturing
in November, 1967, though an option to
redeem on May 31 will be exercised.
The reserve position is strong, with
capital reserves of £226,950 after
eliminating £248,076 goodwill on con-
solidation. Revenue reserves bring total
shareholders’ funds to £1,101,191. Net
assets backing of each 20s. share is
31s. sd.
The current year has opened with a
continuation of the high production levels
of the previous year. With a continuation
of the rate of home building, directors
are confident of maintaining last year’s
rate of profitability.
The shares are currently selling around
275. 6d. after touching 295. late in Sep-
tember. At these levels they appear good

His answer is to lease a car through General Credits.
General Credits lay out the ready cash, he pays a
fixed monthly rental and, if used for business,
payments up to 100% are allowable as a tax deduction.
You want a new car too?

buying, although prospects of short-term
capital appreciation are not strong.
Bowled Over
the novelty of bowling having
” worn off, both from the investors’
and participants’ point of view, the
slump in Rushcutter Ltd’s profit is no
surprise. The market anticipated it to
such a degree, in fact, that the ss.
shares were cut back to 2s. well before
the announcement was made.
But Rushcutter’s activities do not stop
at ten-pin bowling. There is also a
motel to consider. It enjoyed a high rate
of occupancy, but not high enough,
apparently, to offset the bowling centre’s
lower income. A downward trend in
occupancy has been arrested and
promises better results in the current
year.
Profit for the year to June 30 reached
£17,270 (or 4.3 p.c. on capital) com-
pared with the previous result of £23,602
(5.9 p.c. earning rate). Again no allow-
ance for tax was made.
Profit remains after amortisation of
leasehold (just down from Kings Cross,
Rushcutter is built on the site of the
old Rushcutter Bay tram shed), £39,778
(up £6777). Cost of provision for re-
placements is up £6153 to £36,774.
Interest takes £6705 more at £72,606
and the writing off of intangibles re-
quiries £7718, £2077 more than last year.
During the year secured loans were cut
back by £102,121 to £249,514. They
have been further reduced to £236,014
in the current year.
As the company still has heavy loan
commitments, it is unlikely there will
be any striking improvement in its
results, even if occupancy and patron-
age figures increase. For this reason,
caution should be exercised when con-
sidering investment.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Watching Overseas Changes
The backlash from Harold Wilson
you can’t afford to confine your ob-
-*• servations to local developments if
you want to stay on top of this market.
Was I to know that Harold Wilson would
go overboard by announcing a 15 p.c.
surcharge on industrial imports almost
the first day he was in office?
Australia is one of the many coun-
tries which gets the backlash of this
change. It makes the task of balancing
our exports with imports so much more
difficult. Especially so now, with most
people imagining that they deserve the
same wage rise as their parliamentarians.
Hanimex is probably affected as much
as any other Australian company. Of
its yearly sales of about £3 million, about
£1 million is exported to the UK.
The market immediately jumped to
the conclusion that Hanimex was doom-
ed. Three hundred patient days it had
taken for the price to build up from 14s.
to 17s. 6d. It took just three frantic
days to bring it back to the opening
level for the year.
This fall is really out of all proportion
to the situation. First of all, Mr Wilson
stressed that the UK surcharge was only
a temporary measure. Secondly, it is
not discrimination against Hanimex, but
applies equally to all imports of photo-
graphic equipment. This is important,
because the UK market is dominated by
foreign manufacturers. Thirdly, the
summer, which is the sales season, is all
but over in the UK.
If it adds any further weight, Hanimex
should be doing very well locally. When
the market has digested all this, I hope
they feel that the shares will be worth
more than 14s. 3d., the price I paid for
500. Remember, too, that a 9d. divi-
dend is paid later this month—in effect,
I’m getting the shares at 13s. 6d.
Ignoring all the market pessimists
(mainly the same ones who condemned
the 1962 market), I launched into an-
other purchase. ISAS (NSW) has already
been in the portfolio, but deserves to be
added again. Just to refresh your mem-
ories, this is the NSW agent for the
International Harvester Company. A
wide range of earth moving, loading and
handling equipment, logging equipment
and road building equipment is dealt in.
Like many other companies in this
construction field, it felt the pinch of the
recession in 1962. Earning rate dropped
away to 5.3 p.c. and directors were
forced to cut the dividend to 5 p.c.
Progress from here has been quite
markedly upwards. For the year end-
ing March 31, 1964, earning rate had
recovered to 13.3 p.c. and the dividend
rate of 8 p.c. was only a step before the
normal rate of 10 p.c.
This upward trend in profits and divi-
dends seems bound to continue, judging
by the chairman’s statement in June on
“Prospects for the Future”. He said that
“1964-65 will be a brisk year in the con-
struction field” and that the “market in
the timber area has brightened consider-
ably”.
The interim report, due within the
next month, should bring interest back
to the market and so get the shares off
the 25s. mark.
The last purchase this week came from
the mining posts. AOG has been in the
doldrums for so long that I decided to
venture back into one of the diary’s old
favorites. Ampol’s decision not to take
Moonie Oil caused the price to slide
back to 35s. After the Moonie strike, a
number of valuations of AOG shares
appeared. Even though these have fallen
by the wayside, it’s safe to say AOG is
a much more valuable investment now.
After all, it does have another commer-
cial field. Buying 200 shares at 35s. 6d.
can’t do ine much harm.
Sales this week were the balance of
the Conkeys, the 200 Greenbushes which
I received through the Aberfoyle hold-
ing, and the 100 new G. E. Crane.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 Greenbushes, 7/9 £75
100 G. E. Crane, new, 73/- .... £360
600 Conkeys, 14/- £412
BOUGHT
500 Hanimex, 14/3 £364
200 AOG, 35/6 £361
500 ISAS (NSW), 25/- £638
This leaves me with just £3 credit. I
must be one of the few investors who is
100 p.c. invested at this stage.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Red China to Buy Wool?
New problems facing the industry
TTaving shocked the world by letting
off an atomic blast, Red China,
according to some sources, is getting
ready to shock the woolgrowers of the
world by becoming a major buyer of
wool.
The shock, in some ways, could be
pleasant. Prices might be expected to
rise dramatically with the sudden emer-
gence of a new large buyer.
In other ways, however, the industry
might find it difficult to cope with the
situation. Existing buyers, particularly
Japan, would be certain to demand safe-
guards. If these were not forthcoming
they might pull out altogether.
There is not a great deal to go on, but
it seems very clear that something is
going on. Recently the “New York
Times” stated: “The shadow of Com-
munist China is clouding not only the
political situation in South-East Asia
but also a large part of the world’s tex-
tile trade. Buying agents in Australia
would be awaiting word on whether the
world’s largest nation would step into
the wool market with both feet when the
Australian auctions reopened.
“If the mainland Chinese step up
their purchases the delicate balance of
the world’s wool trade could change
rather dramatically. The reason is that
there are fewer major producers in the
market this year. In addition, those
producers’ exports have slipped at a
time when world stocks of wool are the
lowest since 1945.
“While wool usage in the US declined
to 412 million lb (clean) last year from
429 million in 1962, sharply higher de-
mand in Europe, Japan and elsewhere
has more than made up for this decrease.
Meanwhile Australia, which turns out
25 p.c. of the world's supply of apparel
wool, has shown a slight increase in pro-
duction in the last few years.”
HThe “New York Times” could be
wrong, of course. But there are two
matters, about which there can be no
quibbling, which support the theory that
China is about to buy wool in large
quantities.
The first is the repeated statement of
Japanese wool interests that they would
like to see a ceiling incorporated in any
new method of marketing Australian
wool. As things stand now, the Japanese
have nothing much to fear about a
ceiling. There is, in effect, a ceiling in
existence and the Japanese can pretty
well dictate the ceiling. They are the
biggest buyers and the needs of the
other buyers, Britain and the European
countries, are well known and can be
fairly accurately predicted.
Should reserve price selling be imple-
mented, the Japanese would still have
little to worry about—provided the
world buying strength remains much as
it is now. Japanese insistence on a ceil-
ing logically is based on fear of a new
competitor and it has to be China.
The British industry, and the Euro-
pean. is not likely to make any spectacu-
lar new demands. The US might, but
it is highly unlikely. The US seems set
for a long period of tariff protection of
its own highly developed synthetic fibre
industry. India is a potentially big buyer
but is unlikely to solve her foreign ex-
change problem for a long time.
The second fact pointing to China is
the revival in the US of talk of an
international wool textiles agreement.
This is not confirmed at Government
level. It is, however, written about, and
talked about, so much that there can be
little doubt that it is real.
Basically, such an agreement would
tie up the trade in wool textiles to “tra-
ditional and unoffending suppliers”, as
one economic writer terms it. This
means that the US wants the movement
of world wool textiles kept much as at
present.
The only nation capable of large scale
wool textile manufacture, and which
would be classified as “non-traditional
and offending”, would be Red China.
The US has no wool textile industry
of her own to protect, or none to speak
of. She does have cotton exports. But
her real worry would be likely Chinese
exports of wool textiles to a number
of countries upsetting existing trade pat-
terns.
For example, the US can put the
brake on the import of Japanese wool
textiles while Japan has ready access
to other markets. But if China is in
cut-throat competition with Japan, could
the US deny Japan a bigger share of the
US textiles market?
For that matter, in a backhanded sort
of way, we might get more favorable
access to the US with our raw wool.
This assumes that if China buys wool in
large quantities she will become an ex-
porting manufacturer rather than a
supplier to her own enormous popula-
tion.
The latter theory is commonly held,
though it does not stand up to close
examination. Millions of Chinese may
be without shoes, yet millions of shoes,
made in Red China, are being sold all
over Asia and some are even getting to
Australia.
As for tradition, China, whether some
people like it or not, has become a
traditional market for Australia. She is
now our fourth best customer, due prin-
cipally to her wheat purchases. Since
1960, Australia has sold £l7O million
worth of wheat to Red China. Most of
these sales have been on a cash deposit,
with instalments over 12 months.
Australian wheatgrower has never
had it so good, thanks to this mar-
ket. A delegation now visiting Red China,
led by Wheat Board chairman, Mr J. V.
Moroney, is reported to have negotiated
a £4l million deal on the 1964-65 record
crop. Although the details are still up
in the air a little, the wheatgrowers of
this country are drinking yet another
toast to “miracle man” Moroney. Many
believed that, with record crops in
Europe, Canada, the US and the Argen-
tine, the outlook would be grim.
While wheat and wool are closely
associated in the production stage, there
is one very important difference. Wool
is sold by auction. If the reserve
plan comes in, and it is by no means
certain, it will still be sold by auction.
Wheat is sold at negotiated prices.
The Wheat Board makes the best deal it
can and that is that.
A good question is: are the Red Chi-
nese interested in buying Australian
wool provided they can buy it on the
same sort of negotiated price system that
they buy wheat?
If they come in now, they must know
that they will force the price sky high.
Woolgrowers would be delighted. Yet
even the most insular would agree that,
if this happened, Australia would have
to take steps to look after Japan and
the UK and other long-term buyers of
Australian wool.
For a while, perhaps, the bidding
would go up and up. Sooner or later it
is not difficult to imagine Japan, for one,
quitting. This is not 1951 and wool is
no longer necessary even if it may be
desirable.
To say the least, we would be in a
spot. And there would be no certainty
that the sales would continue—just as
there is no certainty that wheat sales will
continue.
Increasingly it is becoming evident

that the striving for industrial and
manufacturing status is viewed differ-
ently in new nations. We might wonder
why China buys our wheat instead of
developing her own wheat lands or why
/she might buy our wool and manufac-
ture it rather than developing her own
undoubted potential for sheep raising.
In Asia and in Africa the new nations
are making it plain that, whether it pays
ior not, they want industrialisation. It is
something which is dictated just as much
,by emotion as economics. They want
to run factories, not herd sheep or till
the soil.
Doubtless they associate primary pro-
duction with their peasant background.
Manufacturing is new and exciting.
Hardship they have known, though not
the “dark, Satanic mills” hardship that
was endured by the Western industrial
nations. They are on an industrialisa-
tion kick if you like. Nothing anyone
tells them will alter this.
Therefore, there is perhaps less rea-
son to be gloomy about the long-term
prospects of the Red China market for
our primary produce than some of us
imagine.
Wool Board chief Sir William Gunn
went to Peking last year. He has been
strangely silent on the really important
question of how the Chinese might like
to buy Australian wool. He has been
accused of personally being in favor of
an acquisition or appraisement scheme of
wool marketing rather than reserve price
within the auction system. These systems
would permit negotiation of prices.
Sir William has strongly denied that
reserve price is a first step towards acqui-
sition. Yet it might appear that if Red
China is to become a big buyer of Aus-
tralian wool, it might very well only
become possible under a scheme of nego-
tiated prices—acquisition or appraise-
ment.
The current conflict between the
various factions within the wool industry
needs no elaboration. If Red China
comes in in a big way this conflict may
well become utter chaos, because pro-
duction has not risen sufficiently, and
is not rising quickly enough, for us to be
able to satisfy a new buyer as well as our
traditional buyers.
Clear, decisive thinking will be needed
and this is the very thing which will be
extremely difficult. Apart from world
power politics, think of all that money
the Marxist devils apparently have to
spend on the things they want!
Seaweeds as Fertilisers
Australias potential worth testing
Tn spite of, or perhaps because of, their
1 country’s history as colonisers in the
19th century, German scientists are very
active in many of the new nations of
Africa. One very interesting area of
Scientific investigation being carried out
hy West German teams concerns the uses
" in agriculture of seaweed and other ocean
plant life.
Some ocean plants are edible, but the
best immediate use for many of them
.appears to be as fertilisers. Considering
the length of the Australian coastline it
is~ rather surprising that so little is known
about similar possibilities here.
As most farmers know, fertilisers are
going to become a big question mark in
Australia when the superphosphate rock
deposits are worked out on Nauru in
about 25 years’ time. It would be too
much to suggest that seaweed is an
adequate substitute for super. Neverthe-
less it would appear that investigation
into its possible uses in the fertiliser
field would be worthwhile.
' It is not just a matter of collecting
he stuff and throwing it on paddocks,
it must be washed, chopped and other-
wise prepared.
There are as many varieties of under-
water plants as there are plants on land.
Some are better than others as fertilisers;
some are no use at all. A great many have
not yet been properly identified and
classified.
In Africa, much has been done in this
direction, although commercial utilisa-
tion of these discoveries is still at the
developmental stage. Machinery specially
designed for processing seaweeds is being
developed; particularly in West Germany,
which has a lead in this field due to the
initial investigation work of her highly
qualified scientists.
Here are some of the seaweed types
for which commercial exploitation off
the African coasts is contemplated:
• Red Algae (Rhodophycae) pro-
vides foodstuffs, auxiliary agents for
many industries (such as agar and carra-
geenan), and may also be used as a
fodder and a fertiliser.
© Aeodes orbitosa is found on the
coast of South Africa and a by-product
can be used for clarifying beer.
© Eucheuma occurs in about 20
varieties off the coasts of Zanzibar and
Tanganyika. It is known as “Zanzibar
weed”.
9 Gelidium occurs in large quantities
on the African coasts and economic ex-
ploitation has started in Morocco.
© Gelidium corneum is encountered
from Tangier to Agadir. _____
• Gigartina occurs in about 90
species and is prolific off the Gold Coast
and the Cameroons.
Large quantities of Gracilaria (7000
tons a year) are harvested near Port
Elizabeth. It is known sometimes as “sea-
string”.
These are only a few of the red algae
and in addition there are the brown algae
species:
• Cystoseira, in about 60 species, can
be used as both a fodder and a fertiliser.
Large quantities are found between East
London and Port Elizabeth.
• Hydroclathrus chlathratus has been
used for centuries in its natural form as
a fertiliser and is very suitable apparently
for modern processing.
• Sargassum, or Gulf Weed, occurs
in most oceans of the world and is
recognised as a useful fertiliser.
And there are many others.
Scientists say that the seaweeds form
a valuable source of raw material for
industrial products such as agar, carra-
geenans and alginates. They are also of
great significance to human nutrition and
agricultural production in the form of
fertilisers and soil improving agents, as
well as fodder additives. The study of
appropriate seaweeds, their propagation
by suitable cultivation, the processing
and use of the products cannot be under-
rated.
In view of what is happening in
Africa, and in other parts of the world
as well, it seems that Australia may have
tremendous potential in the seaweed
business. Clearly it would be unwise for
anyone to start pulling the stuff out of
the ocean without first knowing what it
is good for. A scientific survey would be
money well spent.
