Time.
/ saw Time in his workshop carving facesj
Scattered around his tools lay, blunting
griefs,
Sharp cares that cut out deeply in reliefs
Of light and shade; sorrows that smooth the
traces
Of what were smiles. Nor yet without fresh
graces
His handiwork, for oft-times rough were
ground
And polished, oft the pinched made smooth
and round;
The calm look, too, the impetuous fire re-
places.
Long time I stood and watched; with hideous
grin
He took each heedless face between his knees,
And graved and scarred and bleached with
boiling tears.
I wondering turned to go, when, lo! my skin
Feels crumpled, and in my glass my own face
sees
Itself all changed, scarred, careworn, white
with years.

THE HOUSE OF NIGHT.
Though all the light were lifted from the
land,
And a great darkness lay upon the sea;
Though, groping each for same not-careless
hand,
I felt sad men pass over wearily;
Though it ivere certain dawn would not come
in
With the next hour; that after many days
Would no moon rise where the grey clouds
grew thin,
Nor any stars resume their ancient ways:
Though all the world word thus, and I more
blind
Then the dead, blundering planets raining
past,
I know I should not fancy Time unkind;
For you, as once of old you came, at last
Would surely come, and with unfaltering
faith
Lead me beyond the dominance of death.
FRANCIS SHERMAN.
AMERICA.
Columbus came to thee and called thee new!
New World to him, but thy rich blood, bright
gold,
Lay cold where once the fires manifold
Raged fiercely. New? Primeval forests
grew,
Had fallen, and were coal! Thine eagles flew
Undaunted then as now, and where the bold
South Rocky Mountains rise in fold on fold
The Aztec to his God the victim slew.
The tropic verdure of thy far north world
Had passed for ever, moon-like fading out.
Sky-piercing mounts had reared them from
the seas —
The lost Atlantis had been depth-ward
hurled,
Since thou wert new! — Old! all thy land-
marks shout,
And bid us read thy waiting mysteries.
BABRY STRATON.
THE LAUBENTIANS.
These mountains reign alone, they do not
share
The transitory life of woods and streams;
Wrapt in the deep solemnity of dreams,
They drain the sunshine of the upper air.
Beneath their peaks, the huge clouds, here
and there,
Take counsel of the wind, which *all night
screams
Through grey, burnt forests where the moon-
light beams
On hidden lakes, and rocks worn smooth and
bare.
These mountains once, throned in some
primal sea,
Shook half the world with thunder, and the
sun
Pierced not the gloom that clung about their
crest;
Now with sealed lips, toilers from toil set
free,
Unvexed by fate, the part they played being
done,
They watch and wait in venerable rest.
FREDERICK GEORGE SCOTT.
THE WIND'S ROYALTY.
This summer day is all one palace rare,
Builded by architects of life unseen,
In elfin hours the sun and moon between,
Up out of quarries of the sea and air,
And earth’s fine essences. Aladdin's were
But tinsel sheen beside this gloried dream,
High, sunny-windowed, walled by wood and
stream,
And high, dome-roofed, blue-burnished, be-
yond compare.
Here reigns a king, the happiest known on
earth,
That blithesome monarch mortals call the
wind,
Who roves his galleries wide in vagrant
mirth,
His courtier clouds obedient to his mind;
Or when he sleeps his sentinel stars are still,
With ethiop guards o’ertopping some grave
hill.
WILFRID CAMPHELL.
From “A Century of Canadian Sonnets”
(IVJussen, Toronto).
The cult of furniture is not one of the
vices of the Australian people; the average
Australian home is an artistic horror; but
for the few who are interested there is the
series of “Little Books About Old Furni-
ture” (Heinepiann, 2s. 6d.), of which the
two latest issues are devoted to Chippen-
dale and The Sheraton Period, well illus-
trated. The two previous volumes dealt
with the Tudor to Stewart period and the
Queen Anne era.
2180 A.D.
Here are three frenzied persons mightily
concerned about the future of the race:
Hilaire Belloc, in The Servile State (Foulis;
Is.), Edward Isaacson, in The Malthusian
Limit (Methuen; 3s. 6d.), and F. W. Bus-
sell, in A New Government for the British
Empire (Longmans, Green; 3s. 6d.), each
strenuously advocating his personal panacea.
Belloc’s thesis is that; “Our free modern
society in which the means of production are
owned by a few being necessarily in unstable
equilibrium, is tending to reach a condition
of stable equilibrium by the establishment
of compulsory labor legally enforced upon
those who do not own the means of produc-
tion for the advantage' of ‘those who do.”
This condition of things he terms “the Ser-
vile State,” as the logical development out
of the present capitalist state; and he at-
tempts to prove that a legal status of slavery
is inevitable for the working classes. Of
course, it is recognised that the present capi-
talist state must dissolve into something
more acceptable to the mass of the popula-
tion ; but, brilliant as is Belloc’s argument,
he does not convince us that the socialistic
or the collectivist state is impossible, lie
certainly does manage to point out the ex-
treme difficulty there would be of putting a
state like the United Kingdom upon a social-
istic basis; but his argument is vitiated be-
cause he has confined his reasoning to that
country, and is apparently unaware of the
progress made toward the State socialistic
ideal in Australasia. He has taken the
working classes of England, content, it
seems, to receive the dole of a minimum
wage, with no hope of ever escaping the
status of a laborer into the status of a pro-
perty owner.
“If you were to approach those millions
of families now living at a wage, with the
proposal for a contract of service for life,
guaranteeing them employment at what each
regarded as his usual full wage, how many
would refuse? Such a contract would, of
course, involve a loss of freedom; a life-
contract is the negation of contract and the
acceptation of status. .. .Even as a volun-
tary offer, and not as a compulsory obliga-
tion, a contract of this sort which would for
the future destroy contract and re-erect
status of a servile sort would be thought a
boon by the mass of the proletariat to-day.”
And he asks ; “Of what are ,the mass of men
now most afraid in'a Capitalist State? Not
of the punishments that can be inflicted by
a Court of Law, but of the ‘sack.’ ”
Let him put that question to an Aus-
tralian laborer, and Belloc would be sur-
prised at the answer. Labor has the weapon
of the strike —of which Belloc seems never to
have heard —even in England. And it has
behind that weapon the general desire of the
public for fair treatment of all wage-earners,
as evidenced by our Wages Boards and simi-
lar institutions. The trouble is that Belloc
sees in the British Insurance Act and the
suggested minimum wage an evil conspiracy
to destroy for ever the independence of the
laboring classes. However, he makes a valid
point when he says :
“When the first experiment in a mini-
mum wage was being debated in Parliament,
what was the great issue of debate? Not
that the miners should have an avenue open
to them for obtaining possession of the
mines; not even that the State should have
an avenue open to it for obtaining such pos-
session ; but that the minimum wage should
be fixed at a certain satisfactory level.”
Well, Australia does not go that way to
work. We have the minimum wage—but
the Labor platform itself demands the
nationalisation of all big industries. This
jim-jam. of Belloc’s imagination would be
easily cured by a visit to this continent or
a cursory study of its press.
A New Government for the British Em-
pire, according to F. W. Bussell, should be
brought about by breaking up the British
House of Commons into four or five provin-
cial assemblies, by remodelling the House of
Peers to make it an assembly of delegates
from the whole Empire, by giving that body
sole control over imperial policy—a task
which the present House of Commons is
notoriously unable to undertake, and by
making the sovereign the president of the
Cabinet. “Only with the restoration of re-
spect to Authority (which in this instance
is George) can any real improvement or
better feeling come into our public life.”
That expresses aptly the curious reactionary
point of view of F. W. Bussell.
Edward Isaacson, in The Malthusian
Limit, ranges farther afield. He is
worried over the world in a.d. 2180,
or thereabouts. His theory is that
the falling birth-rate will ultimately
reach its logical end, and the whole globe
as thickly populated as it can be, and pro-
ducing the utmost quantity of food, will re-
main, as regards population, in a static con-
dition. The time when the whole earth will
be populated up to the limit of food supply
has been calculated, from present tendencies,
at a.d. 2180. Then the race will necessarily
be reproduced only at a rate that will keep
its numbers at a constant figure—a condi-
tion of things which has never been the rule
for any large number of the race. This
paper has pointed out that the countries
exporting food are one after another chang-
ing into the category of countries which
have to import food. Ultimately every coun-
try will be so thickly populated that it will
not be-able to export any food. Then, with
just enough food to go round in Australia,
the Mr. Fisher of that day will bring in his
famous bonus system—£s paid yearly to
every wife who doesn’t produce, a baby.
It is an investigation of the conditions of
this static race that Isaacson attempts. He
foresees a division of the race into two classes,
one of which will marry and provide just
sufficient babies to keep the population of the
globe up to the safe limit, and the other, tne
surplus class, who will marry or not as they
like, but will not be allowed the privilege of
babies. Only the physically fit will -be al-
lowed to enter the fecund class, and they
will be kept in the most favorable localities
by themselves, given healthy farm work to
do, required to cultivate all the old-fashioned
“domestic virtues,” and to produce their
quota of infants to carry on the race. The
surplus class would live in compact, child-
less cities, men and women in large, artis-
tic and hygienic clubs, occupying them-
selves in doing the rest of the work of the
world. The sole concern of a member of
this class would be his or her duties to soci-
ety ; he or she would have no concern with
family, and necessarily his or her moral
standards would differ fundamentally from
those of the fecund class. “Really, if people
have no children, the exercise of the sexual
function has no more consequence for so-
ciety than the blowing'of the nose.”
This segregation of the fecund class from
the childless class would have important
bearings "upon city life.
“About half the population of the "city at
present are children. Not only would these
be eliminated, but also all the persons who
are there chiefly on account of children....
and the greater part of the domestic ser-
vants, who are chiefly employed in families.
Most of the inconsistencies and hardships in
modern city life come from the attempt to
keep up the forms developed where the social
unit is the family, under conditions suited
to the individual unit. The most important
of these forms is the household establish-
ment; something economically justified in
modern city conditions only by the presence
of children. Eliminate these and....a city
which now contains a million inhabitants
would probably be reduced to 300,000 or less,
and carry on all the present activities of
general usefulness just as well.”
This condition would practically eliminate
the economic waste known as transportation
of human beings or commodities. Thus, the
disused tube railways of the Sydney of those
days could be easily devoted to the culture
of mushrooms. But, as the ingenious author
remarks: “Further details seem unneces-
sary.”
The theme of the book is its only import-
ance. It is too soon yet to worry over the
problems that will confront our posterity of
a.ek 2180. But it is just as well to remem-
ber that the time is surely coming when it
will be *as great a disgrace for a married
woman to have a baby as, at present, it is
for a woman unmarried.
There is nothing much except words and
three bull-frogs in Australian Idylls and
Other Poems, by E. A. Henty (Mrs. Edward
Starkey), (Elkin Matthews’ Cabinet Series,
Is.). The first bullfrog appears in “Wattle
Blossoms.”
Where a gay old bullfrog splashes ’neath a
boulder out of sight.
In “An Australian Spring Morning,”
And a gay young bullfrog, busy serenading
on a reed,
Disappears beneath a boulder loith a sigh.
And in "Dawn,”
And a pompous bullfrog disappears with a
splash in search of a wife.
It almost seems as if the poet rather over-
does the local color of bullfrogs. There is
plenty of other local color, but verse can-
not live by bullfrogs alone. In “Rex Coron-
atur,” the poet loyally takes liberties with
natural history:—
And beyond tramping of feet 1 and martial
music, an intangible something stronger is
heard—
’Tis the loyal hearts throbbing in far-away
countries, for the pulse of a mighty nation
is stirred.
So a fat brown bee, who's in love with a lily,
booming lazily home on the ambient
breeze,
Stops an instant to whisper to a shy little
rosebud: “Those are England’s voices
from over the Seas.”
While she, answering, nods with a wave of
sweet perfume—in her heart, since the
dawn, is an angel’s tear —
“How they love their God —their King and
Country—and with things like these she
has nothing to fear.”
Feeble stuff, evidently taken by her Eng-
lish publisher as an authentic Australian
voice.
Bards are reminded that the competition
for the guinea offered for the best “place-
poem” submitted closes on the last day of
February. A “place-poem” may be defined
as a poem in which some place is enshrined,
not necessarily described. Many of the verses
already sent in consist of mere topography in
metre.
The Next War
With modern weapons and mass armi« s
the next great war will provide new problem,
of an extraordinary difficulty. It is to anelu
cidation of these new conditions and the
changes in strategy they will produce that
General F. von Bernhardi, of the German
cavalry (retired), has laboriously addressed
himself in the first volume of his work On
War of To-Day (Rees, pet* Sydney kook
Club). One outstanding result of modern
fire will be the elimination of the cavalrv
charge ; but the author finds new and neces-
sary uses for this arm in reconnoitring and
scouting, and the offensive aginst the enemy’s
flanks and communications. The armies
of masses that will be brought into being in
any war with Germany will depend for their
victories chiefly upon (he successful solving
of the problems of supply; for the days are
long past when an army can live on the
country. And the modern army wilt neces-
sarily possess a lower standard of efficiency
and of morale than the smaller, more com-
pact and continuously trained armies of the
past. The difficulty of moving such vast
bodies of men may prove insuperable, or end
in the complete break-down of the strategic
mobility of these armies. In a modern
battle, fought with extended troops over an
immense front, it will be almost impossible
to convey orders from head-quarters to its
parts; thus subordinate commanders must
be largely left to themselves, while each sol-
dier is practically isolated even from his
immediate superior officer. Thus personal
initiative will be restored almost to the posi-
tion it held in medieval times. All the more
necessary, therefore, will it be for every unit
in the huge army to be cognisant of the
general intention of the commander-in-chief
This means that a general scheme must be
communicated to the divisional commanders,
and thence to the privates, before the battle!
The individual soldier must know, in general
terms, what his commander is after. This
German view, it may be noticed, is quite
contrary to the British practice; but the
author shows how fatal that strict central
control proved in the Boer war. Self-reli-
ance has in the modern war been dramati-
cally restored to the private. And it may be
noted that it was the self-reliance of the
Australasian troops sent to the’Boer war
that proved its superiority over the ignorant
mechanical obedience of the Tommy. The
individual soldier must himself want to win:
he will be necessarily almost left to himself
in action ; he must himself estimate his dis-
tances and adjust his sights ; he must know
whither to advance, and what point in the
enemy’s position life is to reach ; and, arrived
there, he must know what to do.
. ‘‘Once the troops have come within effec-
tive range of the enemy’s fire all regular and
comprehensive issue of orders ceases. All
success is entirely dependent on the clear-
sighted action of individual groups and men.
This is what a modern infantry action looks
like; self-reliance_ is everything. .. .Acting
with self-reliance in the sense and spirit of
General Headquarters and of the uniform
plan of battle known to us, is the decisive
factor in modern battle.”
It is to be hoped that Australian Head-
quarters, which learnt that lesson in South
Africa, has not reverted to the British
practice.
By command of Edward and under the
gracious auspices of George, also with
humble gratitude to the King and deep obli-
gation to the Queen for encouragement and
assistance, \iscount Esher has meekly and
humbly ventured to edit the youthful diaries
of Victoria the Good, and publish these in-
nocuous lubrications under the title of The
Girlhood of Queen Victoria in two lordly
volumes (Murray, 365.). The work can be
confidently recommended to all K.C.’sM.G.
The English. Character, by Spencer Leigh
Hughes (Foulis, 55.), .consists chiefly of re-
marks that the Englishman is supposed to
be this and is frequently that, likewise he is,
just, as likely as not, something else. But
for its illustrations in color —the delineation
or English _ types, strongly drawn with just
the_ requisite touch of character-revealing
caricature —it is worth its price. A more
interesting book is The Light Side of Lon-
don, by Edmund B. *D’Auvergne, whose The
of Paris will be remembered,
lhe author writes lightly upon such sub-
jects as London Bohemians, the suburban
pub, and Sunday, in London, with much
knowledge of his subject, and he ex-
udes much recondite information. His
frank chapter on “The Flirtatious Lon-
doner will be read w r ith delight. Ap-
parently the one thing that interests the
Cockney is the pursuit of the woman. Full
1 are here given in the gentle art
of picking up,” which, it may be explained
for the benefit of the decorous readers of
this paper, is the habit—not altogether con-
fined to London—of speaking to a glad-eyed
girl in the street.
The London paper, The Referee, hit upon,
or adapted, from the “Red Page,” the idea
or getting its readers to write the account
°* a day in their lives. The result, published
as A Day in My Life (Macdonald and
Evans, London) and edited by “Vanoc,”
shows, that the Londoner cannot write so
graphically of his conditions as the Aus-
tralian can of his. Several of the contribu-
tors write from Australasia.

ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT
(Lister-Bruston System—Patented).
This plant generates electricity automatically, and does away with large and
expensive storage battery. Can be started from drawing-room or bedroom.
ith the exception of keeping the plant clean, lubricating and filling the
tanks, no attention is required.
Upon switching on the lights the plant works, and when the lights are turned
off the plant stops automatically.
The set is self-contained, and is delivered ready to work. No erection or
foundations necessary; all one has to do is to connect to the wires to the house,
shop, hall, hotel, or town lights, and fill up the tanks with oil. It is exceptionally
cheap as regards lighting costs, the user being able to enjoy all the many advantages
of electric light, at a rate per candle power cheaper than most systems of petrol
gas, acetylene, and other artificial lights, and have current always ready for lights,
fans, cooking, pumps, saws, separators, milking and chaffcutting, sewing and other
machines.
Is absolutely safe and reliable; no smell or fumes, dirt or smoke.

WORDS OF WISDOM.
Providing you contemplate the purchase of a Steam Engine, you naturally
want the best.
MARSHALL
is THE one name to keep prominently before you. Cheap Steam Engines
are dear at any price,” as they will only last a few years and then be rele-
gated to the scrap-heap. The Marshall 6 and 8 h.p. Portables weigh a ton
more than some English Engines, and this ton of metal is worth paying
for —because it’s needed.

i
The Makers say so, and they have
made and sold over 150,000 Engines.
Something “just as good” as Mar-
shall’s is no good to you. Insist on
the genuine article and you will have
no repair bills. Light and heavy
Tractions with extra large Colonial
fire-box. Portables from 2to 35 h.p.,

The Inky Way.
“Galleryite”: Cordially disagree with “The Wild
Colonial Pressman” when he says that Deakin is
the most difficult Australian politician to report.
Bill Lyne, Vic. Labor leader Prendergast, the caca-
phonous Peacock and Senator Millen, are a few of
those who beat him. All these, except Lyne, are
ahead of him in rapidity of utterance; Millen, by
actual test, is five and a half words per minute
in front of him. Prendergast could not be reported
by the Angel Gabriel if it were not for the merciful
fact that every minute he uses that blessed expres-
sion “at all events” three times. This reduces his
per-minute total of necessary words by nine. Millen
uses no extraneous words, and he ought to be cau-
tioned by the Australian Journalists’ Association, or
compelled to write his speeches. Lyne can’t be
fully reported at all, and he can’t be condensed to
satisfy him or anyone else. His speed is nothing.
Neither is his lucidity. Peacock one can become
accustomed to. Leave out every second sentence,
and it’s all right. He always says a thing twice.
His speed goes up to 220 words a minute, and a few
days ago reporters in Melbourne were hoping that
he’d be left out of the Watt Ministry. I maintain,
in the face of much opposition, that Deakin, in his
wildest flights, is always grammatical and coherent,
and never fails to bring his many parenthetical inter-
polations to a satisfactory end so far as good Eng-
lish is concerned. Many a time I’ve cursed when
I've found a sentence continuing on the third page
of my notebook; but I’m ready to swear to the
correctness of his speech. I’d rather not swear as
to what he meant. One of the best things about
him was written by a Melb. Argus contributor long
ago. Mentioning his failings the man said: “It is
true he has not always succeeded in making himself
misunderstood. ’ ’
“S.S.”: Windsor, so far as I can see, was the last
of a race of non-commercial daily-paper editors. He
was a literary man first and always, whereas the
successful editor of a later generation is mainly a
trader, a man of the markets. I shall never forget
my first meeting with Windsor. He was editor of
the Age, and I a very nervous neophyte. I had sub-
mitted a longish set of verse for the Sunday
supplement. He had written asking me to see
him. He could not print my rhymes, he said,
but he offered kindly criticism and advice, and in
half an hour’s talk maintained a friendly and plea-
sant attitude. No other daily paper editor I had
met before, or have met since, left any impression
but that I was in some way guilty of an offence
in contributing, or endeavoring to contribute, literary
rubbish to a great commercial vehicle.
* * * *
“Evan Blessus”: One of the most earnest advocates
of signed journalism is N. S. Wales Attorney-General
Holman, and he has taken more than one opportu-
nity to impress his views on pressmen in the Common-
wealth. In the January number of the Australian
Journalist he expends some ink on the subject.
“Anonymity,” he writes, “gives the journalist the
individual status of the driver of a parcels express
van. Just as the boss directs ‘one of my drivers’ to
take drapery to Potts Point, so the newspaper boss
directs ‘one of my reporters’ to write a story, or ‘one
of my leader writers’ to comment upon it.... And,
similarly, the leader writers on a big daily” (why
not a small daily, or a middling daily, to say nothing
of a microscopic monthly?) “are simply the paper’s
men—or, more colloquially, the paper itself.” Well,
let’s take the case of the reporter sent to do a
story. He has to get his information (we’ll say
about the unsatisfactory state of Parliamentary Labor
politics), and buttons on to Holman. “I want you,”
he’ll say, if_ he is on a proper footing with his
man, “to give me the whole strength of things,
or as much as you can.” We’ll sav Holman does it,
and the story is printed. Whose signature ought to
go on that ? Or, perhaps, a dozen sources are drained
similarly for information, and, maybe, a hunk of
encyclopaedia padded in. Is the man who puts other
people’s knowledge into shape to collar the credit (if
there’s any about) for the lot ? A reporter doesn’t
know half the subjects he is called upon to tackle,
but if he is a good reporter he finds somebody who
does. If, then, he signs the matter as his own
goods, he is obtaining notoriety and status under
false pretences. The same with the leader writer
a large percentage of him. He is given a subject and
a general outline of policy to which he may be
opposed. Of course, he could decline to do the iob
and resign, but, being an ordinary human being he
writes what, in most cases, are the views of’the
editorial staff’s caucus meeting, just as Holman has
to get busy against his judgment when the Labor
caucus runs counter to it. Now, why should the
writer have to sign what are not his convictions?
Also, what good would the signature do anybody?
As for finding employment on a paper where he would
be free to express his multitudinous views, and sign
his work with satisfaction, there wouldn’t be enough
papers to go round unless every man owned one for
himself.

From R. P. Blundell, M.L.A., member of the Ade-
laide Daily Herald’s Board of Management: Th e
effusion of “Wus” (B. 2/l/’l3) amused me; at the
same time, I felt a pang of regret that genius should
be so often drowned. Our paper, thrusting itself
into competition with the Grenfell-street old girl and
the Waymouth-street wobbler (both chiefly interested
in “outing” us), has had a fairly rough road to
travel. And not the least drop in our cup of joy
was provided by those who made the office a haven
They were a fine lot of “rejects,” with a bag-full of
testimonials. (Our enemies frequently supplied the
testimonials.) This will explain why we have had
occasion to pass out a good many men. On the
other hand, a perusal of our records will show that
there are men with us who have been there from
the infancy of the weekly Herald ; and the majority
of our employees came to us when the paper became
a daily on March 10, 1910. That “Wus” is not
among this majority suggests that there is some-
thing radically wrong with him and his pal
“Innards.”

That much-harried morning newspaper, the Wel-
lington (M.L.) Times, is to have one more set of
bosses. The new crowd is mostly the Bretts and
Geddeses, Auckland and Napier paper magnates. W.
J. Geddes has been installed as managing director!
with George Dixon (who was guide, philosopher and
administrator of the famous All-Black hoofballers
that cleaned up Britain) as general manager. Of
course, the first thing done, in keeping with old red
sandstone precedent in the office, was to alter the
make-up of the paper, and milk-shake the editor’s
policy, and clean up the literary furnishings gen-
erally. Judging by the varnish on the leaders the
last few mornings, the main goods in the political
policy department is to be lou Ward and Co. for
another flutter. Still, it is impossible to say. Life
is short; and the man who takes a trick at the
wheel aboard the Times, 10, the Sudden Hand smiteth
him, and his name becometh Mud!

Adelaide, which hasn’t got a monthly paper or
magazine at all, is threatened with one shortly. It
is to be a purely theatrical affair. Parkes (“Van
Eck”), of the Mail, and Gerald Longson, who has
done some press-work in two hemispheres, are cher-
ishing the idea within their shirt fronts.
* * * *
“Rosna”: Melbourne pressman “Billy” Moore, in
the intervals of thrusting Australian plays at London
managers, has been lecturing the Royal Colonial In-
stitute on “Australian Literature and Art.” Georgie
Reid presided, or rather came along to say he
couldn’t, and then made his escape, leaving J. G.
Jenkins to act as locum-tenens. The lecturer said
all that could be expected of him in the time, and
there were refreshing lantern slides of famous Aus-
tralian daubs to serve as eye-openers to the dear
British public, the artists represented being Lambert,
Streeton, Bunny, McCubbin, Longstaff, Lever, Phil-
lips Fox, Coates, Shirlow, Norman Lindsay, Bess
Norris, Dyson, Dora Meeson, Ruby Lind, Fullwood,
Leist, Mahony, Tom Roberts, Hans Heysen and
Quinn. A number of the victims went along to see
that they were not unduly libelled, and Lambert and
Will Dyson were drawn into the subsequent talk.
Incidentally, Dyson perpetrated the one bright re-
mark of the perfectly decorous occasion. Someone
had accused Australians of teaching their grand-
mothers to suck eggs. Dyson said it might be a
disrespectful proceeding, but was also a neat retalia-
tion, since Our grandmothers always wanted us to
suck the eggs of their generation.

worse. When at the hospital Mrs. Freeman, of Alexan-

for cooking purposes, it is the best that I know of. My 20-Light Machine provides sufficient
light for all purposes, in addition to supplying gas for the stove. To be able to do all cook-
ing by gas in a countrv home at a moderate cost is a convenience that must appeal to anyone
making a gas installation, especially when domestic help is at such a premium. Wishing you
all the success that your machine merits. —I am, yours faithfully, (Sgd.) F. C. WAKE.

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-
ments of the opposite sex.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect, flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week. Send 2d.
stamp for a free trial sample and free book.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The River by Night.
On high a growing moon
In star-surrounded state
Is reigning, where of late
There reigned the royal noon
And all its after-hours
Of day-time, birds and flowers.
A low wind yields its breath,
And in the brilliant west
A star goes down to rest;
It is not life nor death
This mood of the river-reach,
But a thing akin to each.
There rises over all
The hoot of a great-eyed owl,
The whimper of water-fowl,
And the unobtrusive call
Of timorous things that hide
In the reeds of the river-side.
The wearied willows weep
Above the passing wave
That hastens to its grave
In that devouring deep
Whose billows evermore
Assail an iron shore.
A child of rain and range
The river goes its way,
By night-time as by day,
Unmindful of all change—
Indifferent to the light
Of noon, the stars of night.
There is a stream sublime
Wherein each high-set thing
Hath transient mirroring.
It is the tide of Time;
Full well, full well we know
How fickle is its show.
Where now is Egypt’s god?
And where is Babylon?
And where each Shining One,
Who, girt in glory, trod
The earth in elder days.
Inspiring song and praise?
Their realms no more abide ;
Long, long ago. they passed,
And newer lights are glassed
Within the callous tide.
A little while, and then
These, too, shall pass... Amen!
The owl Oblivion
Shall hoot derisively,
And what is now shall be
Of like account anon
With yon small life that cries
Its little hour, then dies.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
To-Day.
To-day we walk, to-morrow we fly ;
To-day we think that we all must die;
To-morrow we know that a medicine man
Has sterilised Death in his vacuum pan.
The day before yesterday all we knew
Was that nothing we’d learnt before was
tme,
And that all the world was a bunch of
shakes
That only form in our fancy takes.
But yesterday found us making terms
With a universe peopled with working
germs; .
And only this morning we woke to be
All radio-active energy.
I can only hope that, they’ll tell me soon
If the world will exist this afternoon,
And whether I’ll be, next quarter day,
A wave, or a germ, or a violet ray.
MAJORCA.
WAIF.
The Sphinx.
Lonely, impassive and inscrutable
She crouches, like some creature of the
waste,
Gazing across the sands with granite eyes,
And still mysterious smile, and scroll-like
brow
Stamped with the cipher of the great cold
stars,
And the fierce sun, and restless desert winds.
Still does she smile, watching the centuries
Pass, and has seen kings die and conquerors
fall,
And empires rise -and fade and be no more,
And gods grow old and perish; aye, and
seen
Man striving slowly to his strength—as Nile
O’erspreads the fields in Spring resistlessly
A little while, ere to his former bed
He sinks back, and the fields are green
again,
With no sign where of late the river lay,
Save for a little sKme that dries to dust
The first wind whirls away.
So gazes Time
Across the desert of Eternity,
The grim lips curved in the same awful
smile,
And the same secret in the lidless eyes.
N.S.W.
FRITZ S. BURNELL.
The Wrong Brand.
His right hand grasped the steering-wheel,
His left arm clasped the lady;
The night policeman saw them reel
Upon a comet made of steel
Along wide streets and shady.
The night wind whispered near
“He’s wearing out his father’s car!”
“And where were you last night, my boy?”
Inquired his dad next morning.
Then Father’s Hope and Mother’s Joy—
A heart of gold without alloy —
Mean tarradiddles scorning,
Replied, “You told me, Dad. to toil.
I lurnt a little midnight oil!”

COMMER LORRY — 3-TON CAPACITY.
“COMMER” Motor Lorries
Capacity : t Ton to 7 Tons.
Time was when the “Commer” Motor Lorry was an “innovation.” Time
was when a few enterprising commercial “experimentalists” each installed a
Commer, . and the balance of the business-world watched the new depar-
ture with interest.
Time passed—and established the fact that what had looked like a daring
and costly experiment had proved the finest form of business economy. The
“Commer”—that was an “innovation”—has become
An Absolute Business Necessity.
Bj increasing the radius of your business the “Commer” adds to your list
of customers. Its speed and capacity mean that you can reach and handle
business that formerly might have needed the establishment of a local branch.
The “Commer” Lorry deserves the earliest and fullest investigation by
the merchant or the carrier. It means the expediting of business, the con-
venience of the owner, and the satisfaction of the customer.
Carrying capacity, 1 ton to 7 tons. Engine, 4 cylinders, cast in pairs;
Bosch high tension magneto ; gear driven, also coil and accumulator; chain
drive with chain cases ; automatic lubrication; efficient radiator; three, four
and five speeds forward and one reverse; direct drive on top gears always
in mesh with dog clutch drive; foot brake on driver between gear box and
differential, operated by pedal on foot board ; side hand brakes, operated on
drum of rear wheels; internal expanding positively taken on and oft' (on
larger models a special spring buffer drive is fitted between differential and
gear box, the latter being of the “fool-proof” type) ; complete set of tools,
ball bearings throughout.

THE WORSHIP OP THE GOLDEN CALF.
The N.S.W. Labor Conference has censured the McGowen Government for assisting Private Enterprise to enter the Iron and steel
business In defiance of the Labor policy of establishing State iron and steel works.
"They have turned aside out of the way which I commanded them, and they have made a molten calf and have worshipped it. And
as soon as he saw the calf and the dancing. Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hand and brake them.”-Exodus xxxil.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to ah extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any

ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the form
of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse, Short
Tales or Sketches , (those dealing with Australian sub-
jects, and not exceeding two columns in length, or,
say, 8000 words, are specially acceptable), Paragraphs,

will be regarded as strictly confidential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when
the address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But
no MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these
conditions are observed. When MS. is forwarded with-
out stamps for return it will be understood that the
copy is to be destroyed if not acceptable. Personal
applications for return of MS. cannot receive atten-
tion. The Bulletin desires, further, those sending
MS. to distinctly understand that it is not respon-
sible for the preservation or transmission of MS.

SWEATED GENIUS.
One of the scandals of civilisation has always
been the miserably inadequate way in which
nations pay the men who have served them,
by comparison with the lavish scale on which
they recompense those who have been con-
cerned merely to serve themselves. While
Lord Roberts was winning Britain’s battles,
Blundell Maple was making its furniture.
Lord Roberts is a poor man to-day, as Eng-
lish country squires go, while at least one
descendant of the Tottenham Court-road
trader is worth millions sterling. Kit-
chener, Cromer, Churchill, Meredith,
Curzon, Russell of Ivillowen —add together
the whole of the fortunes owned or be-
queathed by the possessors of these glitter-
ing names, and the sum total will fall well
below that for which some nationally-useless
London financier or stockbroker might draw
his cheque in the certain expectation of hav-
ing it honored. In bygone days a certain
tvne of public man did his bpst to correct an
anomaly which was naturally a source of
chronic irritation to him, by stealing from
the State the difference between the small
sum which it paid him for his services, and
the generous figure which he considered
those services worth. In the reign of
Charles 11. almost all the public officials
were underpaid, and most of them re-adjusted
the inequity by accepting bribes, secret com-
missions and so forth, to their own greater
comfort, but to the manifest detriment of the
Commonweal. Thus it is as certain that
Pepys habitually thieved from the Admir-
alty as it is that Fox drank and that
Casanova was a card-sharper. Of course,
there have been honorable exceptions all
through the ages. We have had them in
Australia —herds of them. They have dif-
fered in many respects, but one characteristic
has been common to practically all of them—-
they have died poor. The life story of old
John Robertson, for whose indigent de-
scendants a public collection is being taken
up in N. S. Wales to-day, is typical
of that of hundreds of public servants who
did their duty according to their lights.
In their cases honesty was its own punish-
ment. The second decade of the 20th cen-
tury finds the cost of living soaring upwards
with a speed that baffles statisticians, re-
viewers, scientists and all the other experts
who in the past have provided soothing ex-
planations of such movements, and mentioned
explicitly when the end might be ex-
pected. New standards of luxury have been
created. Also, many things which used to be
regarded as luxuries have developed into
necessities. The business man who earns his
vast dividends by supplying them, or some
of them, to the public, has no need to turn
a financial hair. His income swells auto-
matically with the bloating prosperity of his
State. The same applies, more or less, to
the architect who builds for him, to the
lawyer who stands by him while he litigates—
in fact, to every class of professional men.
The one citizen who is shut out from the
rush for the cash spoil—provided he remains
honest —is the unfortunate who is required
to battle along on a fixed salary—a salary
fixed, too, in almost every instance, at a
time when the world was not only much
younger, but incomparably simpler and
cheaper in its habits.
No sympathy need be squandered on the
nonentities. A. tragically big proportion of
our politicians figure in this class. They
could not earn their screws at any other job
than the leisurely one which they hold at
present. In the search for first-rate men —
meaning men who would shine, at their own
calling, in any company in the world —one
has to go outside politics. For example, to
the High Court. Chief Justice Griffith
has his obvious defects and weaknesses. He
is no monument of courtesy and toleration
and considerateness in his relations with
those of his learned brethren from whom he
chances to differ. The cast of his mind is
such that he interprets the Constitution in
the narrowest possible fashion. But that
he is a very great man no reasonable person
will attempt to deny. Australia has never
before had a judge or a lawyer of his
calibre, and it has had some good ones in
its time. There is no bigger figure on the
British or American Bench to-day, and if the
opinion of contemporary lawyers of all
types and of every shade of political thought
goes for anything, the verdict of history will
put him on a level with the legal giants of
all time. Incidentally, as Premier, and ulti-
mately as Chief Justice of his own State of
Queensland, as an earnest Federalist, as
Chairman of the body which drafted the Bill
embodying a basis for constituting the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth, and in various other
directions, he has deserved extremely well
of his country. What does his country do
for him? In return for services of the
supremest importance and responsibility, for
work of a most technical and arduous de-
scription, necessitating the discomforts of
constant travel, it pays him £3500 per an-
num, without a pension. The head man in
at least one big Australian store is reputed
to get £5OOO per annum. It is possible to
point to local managers of a dozen foreign
importing firms who do as well —men of
the type, in certain respects, of the genial
citizen who lately hashed up a sewing ma-
chine co.’s affairs. Archbishop Wright, of
Sydney, is paid £2250 per annum, and al-
lowed, in addition, a rent-free house. It
was mentioned in a paragraph only last week
that the Archbishop of Melbourne gets £2OOO,
with extras, and that the diocese expects
to have to pay the next man £3OOO. A high
order of mentality is not demanded. There
may be subtle and tremendous difficulties in
connection with the art of successfully Arch-
bishing in a country like Australia; but they
are not obvious. A series of undistinguished
English parsons have followed one another
in this holy and well-salaried enterprise.
No failures have ever been reported, so one
may take it they all did satisfactorily. By
the general look of things any intelligent,
sober and well-behaved ex-curate could do
as well —provided always he was an English
ex-curate. Fight promoters, theatrical en-
trepreneurs, book-makers, proprietors of
vaudeville circuits and pony racecourses, and
others even less worthy, live uproariously
and leave fortunes when they die. Mere
genius works desperately for what would
scarcely keep these illiterate and non-pro-
ductive, and, in many cases, absolutely unde-
sirable, citizens in vintage champagne and
motor-cars.
Obviously there is something seriously
wrong with a social system which encourages
a Yiddish bookmaker, of a low order of in-
telligence, no particular education, and
deplorable habits, to wax fat and affluent,
while the owner of the very best brains and
character that the race is capable of evolving
has to pinch and save to keep up the appear-
ances essential to his position. This paper
is not a Socialist as the lower orders of
Toryism understand the term ; that is to say,
it does not advocate dispossessing the Hebrew
of his gains. It does not yearn to see the
more successful children of the Ghetto
levelled down, in a financial sense; but it
does claim that the time has arrived when
it would be all in the public interest if the
salaries in a number of callings were lev-
elled up. Failing a resolute move in this
direction, the factor of human nature will
enter into the problem, and our supply of
men for public offices will begin to deteri-
orate. As apnlied to Federal Judges this
will do incalculable harm to the Common-
wealth. Already there is a certain disin-
clination apparent among leaders of the
Australian Bar to accept a seat on the High
Court Bench. The primary reason is that
they can do better, whether as counsel or as
judges, in their respective States. Thus,
Chief Justice Cullen, of N. S. Wales, gets
the same annual salary as Chief Justice
Griffith, of Australia, plus a generous pen-
sion when he retires. The work of the
State Judge is easier; it does not involve
violent unpopularity with any section of the
community; it does not provoke enraged
criticism from any political quarter; and
most of it is carried on within reasonable
distance of home comforts. Parliament
should begin a badly-needed reform cam-
paign by instituting a system of pensions
for High Court Judges. It is not so much
a question of keeping up the standard of
the Bench —though that is, of course, a thing
of vital it is of doing an act of
plain justice. State judges, in almost every
case, are lavishly pensioned. In the United
Kingdom, under the Judicature Act, of
1873, judges of the Supreme Court receive
pensions equal to two-thirds of their salaries.
The Lord Chancellor of England gets
£5OOO per annum on retirement, no matter
how short a time he may have held office.
The Lord Chancellor of Ireland —a far
poorer and less populous country than Aus-
tralia —goes into private life with nearly
£4OOO a year. One of the few re-
spects in which the American Constitution
differs from ours is in the circumstance that,
under it, Federal judges get an annuity on
retiring. There exist in various parts of the
world army and navy pensions, perpetual
or hereditary pensions, political pensions,
civil list pensions, ecclesiastical pensions
and a heap of others. There is no more
justification for any of them than there is
for the granting of pensions to the members
of the High Court of Australia. When the
pensionless Federal judge has lopped off part
of his annual salary for payment into a sink-
ing fund to provide for his old age. or for
the support of his dependents, he is liable to
be a very indigent official indeed. The
larger his family the more he has to sacri-
fice. There has already been one instance
of a Federal judge who, after living the best
vears of his life to the service of Australia,
found himself so situated that, though his
health had failed badly, yet he was not. in
a position to retire. In a self-respecting
community, possessed of the faintest capacity
for gratitude, a situation of that sort should
never arise ; and it is to be hoped that the
tragedy will never be possible again.
THE TWO THINGS THAT STAND
FIRST.
Writing of Freetrade in Denmark. A.
Pesciicke Koedt makes the striking re-
mark that, “consciously or unconsciously,
military defence is everywhere mixed up
with tariff protection.” This is intended
as a gibe at those who believe in the efficacy
of tariff walls to foster industry and advance
prosperity; but Protectionists may accept
the statement at its face value, and find in
it a tribute to the clear view and sincere
purpose of those who, awaking to a full
sense of nationhood, take measures for
guarding that nationhood at every point.
To say that the same man who desires that
the people shall be able to earn a decent
livelihood also desires that they shall use
every means in their power to guard their
hearths and homes is to say that the Pro-
tectionist takes a broad, honest view of the
world as it is, and is awake to the dangers
of modern civilisation as well as its enor-
mous possibilities. Yet in the curiously-
warped view of the Freetrader this attitude
of mind is an offence, and its mere state-
ment is supposed to have in it something of
scorn. It is true that much may be par-
doned to the Danish economist owing to the
peculiar position of his small cowyard in
the Baltic, which represents the modern re-
mains of the empire of Canute or Valde-
mar. Having no industries to protect, and
devoting himself wholly to agriculture,
Freetrade does not look in his eyes the in-
jurious thing it appears to others; and
although in Denmark the business of de-
fence is attended to pretty thoroughly and
22,000 fresh recruits are drilled every year,
yet, after the tramping down of his little
armies by Prussia in 1864, the Dane may be
forgiven if he thinks that a good deal of
his war preparation is waste of time. In
plain fact, Denmark is a falling not a rising
State, and though its people are industrious,
well educated and sufficiently patriotic, its
big national dreams and ideals faded out
and were lost several centuries ago. In
most respects the Dane is a very fine fellow,
but when it comes to speaking in the voice
of nations his is the word of the well-
whipped, tail-down race; not of the people
of new energy, strong hope and big economic
ambition. The economist from Copenhagen
may manage his parish affairs to his own
complete satisfaction, but he is not qualified
to .speak for the world at large.
Taking Koedt’s remark at its plain face
valtie, however, recent Australian history
gives it a good deal of point and force. In
the Commonwealth the matter of armed de-
fence has gone hand in hand with protec-
' tion of industries. A dozen years ago Aus-
tralia rose strong and united, welded into
one nation, and realising how great might
be the destiny of a people who possessed
complete and unchallenged ownership of an
undivided continent. At once two questions
sprang into positions of prime importance
—the fostering of Australian manufactures
by tariff duties and the efficient guarding
of Australian homes'by an armed citizen
force. The demand for these things was
the natural expression of the new nation-
hood. At all hazards the white man’s in-
heritance in the splendid land must be kept
inviolate for the white man’s children, and
by all reasonable means the inheritance it-
self must be developed to provide industrial
employment for its. people. To that demand
the legislators of the country slowly rose.
They introduced Protection of a kind for
industries, and a Defence system of a kind
for safeguarding the national possessions.
In neither did they realise the ideals of the
people; for if one thing has been more ap-
parent than another it is that the alleged
leaders of the people lack the vision to see
and the imagination which the call of the
great future demands. Still something in
the way of Protection and Defence was
attempted, and the people, accustomed to
long and weary waiting before they came to
their own, were prepared to exercise some
patience, believing that, a foundation having
been laid, the work must sooner or later g 0
on to completion. They are still exercising
that patience, while the foolish political
parties toss the ball to and fro.
Military defence and protection of in-
dustries are still linked together in Austra-
lia. At the outset of the Federation they
were linked together by a splendid hope; to-
day they are linked together by something
like a common wrong. On the one hand we
have an alleged Protection which does not
protect, and on the other a system of De-
fence which cannot adequately-defend. Over
the low and insufficient tariff walls cheap
foreign imports are coming in at a greater
rate than ever, while Australia’s little chil-
dren are being trained to fill their places in
the citizen army which should from the very
first have been recruited from the ranks of
strong manhood. Tariff increases, which
might save our young industries and be the
cause of a large increase in our manufac-
turing activities, are delayed because they
do not fit in with the party scheme of poli-
tics ; and, at the same time, all the simple
aids to Defence, in the shape of improved
transit facilities between North and South
and re-arrangement of gauges on the inter-
state railways, are hung up and neglected
because the men in the party struggle are too
blind to see beyond the lobbies and the Cau-
cus. Our parish politics are not confined to
the States Frights that infest our minor legis-
lators. There are men who claim to be large
Australians whose views are just as restricted
and narrow, and who, by their apathy on
great questions or their inability to grasp
the real situation, are handing over the work
by which Australians should earn their
bread to the cheap foreigner, and risking the
destruction of Australian homes at the
hands of the brown Asiatic. Australia has
any number of questions slill to settle (in-
cluding the vital one whether John Smith
shall or shall not have sixpence a day more
than he is paid at the present moment) ;
but the two great matters which overshadow
all others are those which from the birth of
the Federation have been inseparable in the
public mind. The Federal capital may be
called Mvola or O’Malley or plain Mud in
the days to come, but the man or the party
which fearlessly tackles the problem of
nation building must place first things first,
and leave the things which are merely orna-
mental to follow in their natural order.. The
matter of national security, both against
unfair trade competition from without and
the guns and warlike pleasantries of any pos-
sible invader, is above every other; and he
is no statesman, but the poorestvsort of petti-
fogging party politician, who fails to see it.
THE RARE AUSTRALIAN HORSE,
AND THE RARER AUSTRALIAN
HORSEMAN.
From “Cavalryman” :
I see that Defence Minister Pearce talked to the
papers the other day as follows !V-
Two years ago we had not a solitary battery in
Australia for which a special horse tearn was pro-
vided. Now we have horses for every battery. &>me-
thing, therefore, has been done. The horses we Jiave
were all bought locally, and are quite efficient, and
we can get more of them for as many batteries as we
wish. Previously reliance had to be placed on
brewery and quarry horses for battery work, and the
same horses could never be obtained for two consecu-
tive drills.
It is magnificent, but it is mostly incorrect. Only
a few short weeks ago the identical journal which
printed the above was responsible for these depress-
ing truths: —
Complaints are heard throughout the ranks of the
Field Artillery—known prior to the recent reorganisa-
tion of the Citizens’ Forces as the A.F.A. —that as
regards facilities for exercise with the guns the bat-
teries are worse off now than under the old system
when horses had to he hired to draw the guns It is
said that horses are now practically unobtainable for
battery purposes, and officers and men alike are won-
dering where all the horses purchased by the Remount
Department, and trained for artillery purposes, have
gone to.
It was mentioned, casually, that the guns of No. 1
Battery had been in use by the Victorian Battery of
R.A.F.A. during the previous five or six weeks, so
that, during this period, the three metropolitan bat-
teries of field artillery had but one battery of four
guns to drill with. The paper wound up
In the circumstances, it did not matter much, for
in any case there have not been sufficient horses
available for some time past to completely horse even
one battery.
Now, if the trouble in the Balkans has demon-
strated any one fact more clearly than another, it is
that efficient artillery is of priceless value in modern
warfare. But the best of guns are useless without
the right sort of horses, arrd plenty of them. Has
Australia sufficient good-class horses available for the
military exigencies of the moment? And is it
making any serious preparations to meet the require-
ments of the future?
To both of these urgent queries the citizen with in-
side knowledge will promptly say “No.” The first
delusion which the city-dwelling Australian (and a
lamentably large proportion of Australians are city-
dwellers) needs to get out of his mind is that the
backblocks are teeming with the splendid animals
over which our horse-poets have expended so much
superfluous ink. Marvels of the type of Pardon, the
son of Reprieve, are as rare in the remotenesses of this
great country as honest fruiterers. Thanks to careful
breeding on the part of big station-owners and others,
Australia had a useful line in horseflesh to boast of
a couple of decades ago. But the big estates are
bursting broadcast under the influence of the land
tax. And, anyhow, the vogue of the horse, except as
a racing-cim-gambling machine, has passed. The
era of the motor is here. People no longer lay them-
selves out to acquire smart hacks and good-looking
boggy horses. In country pubs, and other places
where bucolic idlers and yappers and braggarts fore-
gather, one hears more nowadays of carburetters and
cylinders and the blastiferous price of tyres than one
does of sloping shoulders and the beauty of a game
head and a flat pair of legs. In short, the factors of
private enthusiasm and sporting rivalry, which have
done so much in the past for horse-breeding, may be
dismissed from the national mind. They will never
serve Australia again to any extent worth mention-
ing. The second delusion which requires to be dis-
pelled is that Australians, as a race, are skilful and
experienced horsemen and horse-masters. It might
have been so in the old, wild days, that we still read
about occasionally in the Strand Magazine, the Lon-
don Ladies’ Home Bleat, etc., etc., but in these
prosaic times we are about as much at home in the
saddle or the stable-yard as the average inhabitant of
Glasgow or the Outer Hebrides. British and Conti-
nental cavalry men are required, as part of their
training, to ride across country. For years Lord
Roberts would have no one on his staff who was
not willing to follow him over any fence. Amateur


riders, and of no mean quality, abound in the jump-
ing events of the English and Irish horse-shows. At
Australian horse-shows the same iron faces turn up,
aboard the different jumpers, year after year. They
belong to pros., who make a living by steering the
circus-animals, which appear regularly at these en-
tertainments, over the tall timber at a guinea or so
a time. The amateur who takes anything of the sort
on is regarded by his friends as a lunatic. So far
as hunting is concerned, it is poor in quality and
confined to an infinitesimally small section. The net
result of these things, plus the bloating of the big
cities, and the decline of the horse as an animal of
fashion, is that about 90 per cent, of Australians
simply cannot ride as a soldier understands the term.
It is probable that this country, which the simple
Briton pictures as seething with buckjumpers be-
stridden by icily calm youths in red .shirts and bowie
knives, is almost as incompetent in the matter of
horsemanship as Japan, whose cavalrymen, during the
last manoeuvres, fell crashing to the earth practically
every time their mounts shied or pecked.
What does the Defence Department propose to do
to ensure that (1) Australia shall set about acquir-
ing afresh some of that huge mass of equine capital
which it has squandered so recklessly of late years,
in the “Eastern” (meaning the Indian and Ceylon)
trade, in the S’African war, and by way of sales of
blood and other stock to Japan ; and (2) that Aus-
tralia’s citizen soldiers shall be able to ride and
handle the animals when they materialise? As re-
gards the first question, it is plain, for the reasons
cited above, that to rely wholly on Private Enter-
prise, either now or at any future time, will amount
to madness. A Government horse-breeding establish-
ment, on a big scale, is a first essential. Here, with
the help of the right class of sires and mares, a
steady stream of animals, suitable for cavalry and
mounted infantry remounts, and for artillery work,
might be turned out. There would be nothing like
enough of them, to start with, to meet the present
furious demand. So it would be an admirable thing
if all the different States could be prevailed upon to
subsidise certain stallions of recognised worth, and
supply them with certificates of soundness and merit
generally. (The Commonwealth has no power to it-
self interfere, in this way, with the internal trade
and commerce of the States, nor will it have, until
the electors have, by referendum, agreed to an amend-
ment of the Trade and Commerce clause in the Con-
stitution.) All uncertificated stallions would be under-
stood by breeders to be, ipso facto, undesirable in
some way or other. This would do a lot to check the
output of useless weeds, which is one of the marked
-features of horse.-breeding in Australia to-day. The
offspring of these sound and well-shaped sires would
need to be considered by skilled buyers. There is a
general feeling all over the Commonwealth that the
nation’s horse-trading is being unskilfully done. The
authorities have, admittedly, bought some good
animals at a reasonable price here and there, but
they have also bought a large number that would be
villainously dear at any price. Let the buying be put
in the hands of recognised experts, appointed in
every case for no other reason than that they know
all there is to be known about the fine points of a
horse. The depots where the' young animals are
broken in are fairly languishing at the present time
for decent horse-masters. From Enoggera, in Queens-
land, to Guildford, in Westralia, the same dreary tale
of incompetency is heard in regard to the way green
horses are mishandled by the butchers who mas-
querade as skilled breakers, and draw the State’s good
money on that false pretence. One depot only emerges
with a more or less clean sheet from such investiga-
tions as it has been possible to make —namely, the
one in Victoria. It is significant that it has been
supervised not by soldiers but by professional horse-
exporters, men who know from A to Z the game of
turning out good-conditioned and well-mannered
steeds. But the immediate need is the establishment,
without delay, of a State stud farm or haras, such as
France, Russia and most other civilised countries
possess. Ideal places for such a venture are to be
found in the Northern Territory and North-West
Queensland. Given an experienced supervisor and
good stock to begin with, the perfect climate and
environment could be relied on to do the rest. In a
little while the grotesque complaint that Australia—
once the horsiest of countries —had not sufficient
steeds to pull its gun-carriages, would cease to be
heard. And in the course of time—after our break-
ing-in depots have been reformed, and after our
young men have learned not merely to talk about
horses, but to ride and drive them —the Common-
wealth artillery arm may begin to find itself on a
level with that of Bulgaria and Montenegro.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Apple Speck Elections.
After all the noise with which the inhabi-
tants of the Apple Speck have disturbed the
sleep of the summer-tourists during the past
week or so, the local political battle has
resulted in parties remaining exactly as they
were before the elections. Premier Solo-
mon’s side of the Assembly still numbers 16
“Liberal” noses, and John Earle’s side re-
tains its 14 pairs of more or less horny
hands. Norman Cameron, the elongated
Tasmanian-bred Scotch paradox whose ex-
travagant humor filled the Solomon Gov-
ernment with jumps and deadly fear during
the past Parliament, but who voted on the
Tory side in all important divisions, has
disappeared from view. Yet as his place
has been taken by the ancient and dread-
fully dull Jonathan Best, who was for a
good many weary, dreary sessions Chairman
of Committees, and was displaced last Anril
by the Cameron person, it is hard to dis-
cover how the House or the Ministry or the
country is likely to benefit by the change.
Cameron was sometimes entertaining; Best
is always ponderous and preachy. There the
difference ends. Cameron often threatened
the Government; so will Best. There the
similarity begins, and the end is not yet.
As ex-Minister and ex-Chairman of Com-
mittees llean is amonest the slain, it seems
probable that Best will demand and obtain
the Speakership, which, it is understood,
Davies does not intend to take this time.
The onlv other changes made by the elec-
tors are that Lib. lawyer Fullerton dis-
places Lib. builder Valentine in Denison,
and L. F. Giblin replaces W. Sheridan on
the Labor side in the same electorate; Lib.
Sadler squeezes out Lib. McKenzie in
Bass, where also A. Anderson, union secre-
tary, displaces Jas. Guy, Workers’ Political
League general secretary. Tim place in this
electorate formerly filled by Bakhap, who
is to try for a Lib. Senate seat. 1S n< 7 w
occupied by a new man named Hayes. An
elderly coit named Cotton takes llean s
job in Franklin. Though the party numbers
are unchanged, there is a sort of gam to tne
Government in that a couule or three dan-
gerous by-elections have been avoided n>
holding a general election. But as ex-1 re-
nder Lewis is pretty sure to got a chance or
climbing to the Supreme Court Bench
within a few months, there will be a by-
election for Denison, and Labor will
probably win the seat. Parties will then be
lo all, and the deadest sort of deadlock ever
heard of in the world of Parliamentary Gov-
ernment will ensue. While Solomon owns
a majority of one on the floor of the Assem-
bly, he had better use it to alter the Hare
electoral law. Otherwise there will be abso-
lutely no business doing for perhaps years—-
nothing but elections. The easiest way to
overcome the trouble would appear to be the
alteration of the Electoral Act to provide
for an odd number of representatives in each
of the five divisions, instead of the even
number now obtaining. Then one side or
the other would always have a majority of
at least one ; Under the law as it stands at
present, it is quite possible for neither side
to have a majority of members in the House,
though there may be a clear majority of
votes cast at an election in favor of the
candidates of one of the two parties. It is
an interesting situation for the student of
electoral systems to watch, but for the tax-
payer who expects Parliament to do some-
thing useful for him, it is not much joy.
A Leader Who Requires Gagging.
The egregious Joseph Cook has only been
in command of the hosts of Liberalism for a
matter of days, yet already he has made as
many damaging mistakes as his predecessor
would have been guiltv of in a year. They
have been mostly of the niggling variety—
the sort that stamp their perpetrator as the
owner of a small and absurdly provincial
mind. Thus he complained bitterly, last
week, that no Liberal had been invited to the
Government Dockyard picnic in Sydney. As
a matter of fact, an invitation had been sent
to him, also to C. G. Wade and other Lib-
erals. But, in any case, the voicing of such
“wrongs” constitutes the politics not of a
nation, but of a parish. Alfred Deaktn
has his faults, and so have Forrest and W.
11. Irvine and a dozen other prominent Lib-
erals that might be named ; but it is impos-
sible to picture any of them moaning pub-
licly over the fact that he had not been
bidden to a Dockyard picnic. About the
same time that the Dockyard wail appeared,
a Sydney daily published the following :■ —
Mr. Cook took the complaint of mismanagement at
the City Council’s fish market as an instance of a
Socialistic failure. “There must be failure in all
these matters,” said he. “The slightest test of prac-
tical experience seems to bring down these Socialistic
houses altogether.”
One expects that sort of imbecility from very
old ladies, the more illiterate class of com-
mercial men and so forth; but in the mouth
of the leader of a responsible political party
it is amazing. Instead of “practical experi-
ence bringing down Socialistic houses,” a
steady increase of municipal Socialism has,
for years, been the hall-mark of every pro-
gressive modern city. Such great British
towns as Birmingham, Bradford, Manches-
ter, Liverpool. Glasgow and Leeds own and
administer “Socialistic houses” which con-
trol every conceivable sort of markets ; also,
Turkish baths, plunge baths, swimming
baths and lavatories; ferries, river steamers
and docks; libraries, parks, railways and
real estate. Colchester owns and exploits its
own oyster beds —and after Private Enter-
prise has poisoned a few more citizens with
Middle Harbor oysters, Sydney may begin
to think about following suit. The chief
attractions at nearly all the big European
spas and watering-places are Socialistic. In
this connection The Bulletin quoted from
the S. M. Herald, only last week, as
follows :
The municipality of Manly has no enterprise such
as we find in the seaside resorts of the Old World.
As a contrast to Manly take Torquay The corpora-
tion’s proposals include a modem installation of
medicated, electric and seaweed baths, the improve-
ment of the Princess Gardens, the erection of a public
library, municipal offices, town hall, and pavilion for
municipal orchestra. The Princess Gardens con-
tain a theatre, a cafe, a restaurant and roof promen-
ade, dressing-rooms, etc.
The Herald had no rebukes to direct at
Torquay for its Socialistic tendencies, as evi-
denced in these enterprises. On the con-
trary, it expressed the hope that Manly would
find in them a source of inspiration. If
there is one sociological fact that is surer
and more patent than another, it is that the
more the modern municipality gets of Social-
ism the less it is appalled at it. Which is
merely another way of saying that munici-
pally-run services have not proved failures in
the vast majority of cases, and that the poli-
tician who argues to the contrary is either a
liar or an uninstructed ass. This paper s
view is that Joseph Cook is the latter
variety of calamity. In that event, Liberal-
ism’s best hope will be to firmly gag him.
But history presents no instance of a politi-
cal party which surged to glorious victory
under the sway of a firmly-gagged leader.
Pulsford and Protection.
Edward Pulsford, who was dropped from
the Senate as soon as possible after his old
Freetrade fetich had been cast overboard,
has contributed to an English magazine,
The Burden of Protection, an article on
fiscal affairs in the Commonwealth As
furnishing examples of the sort of argu-
ments which a Freetrader can extract from
awkward figures and circumstances, this
statement of the case is not uninteresting.
Manufactures have increased enormously
under Protection, and so have natural pro-
ductions. The average person would leason
from this that a Protective policy was shown
to be an advantage to manufacturing enter-
prise while in no way injurious to primary
producers. Not so Pulsford who pro-
fesses to see in the figures a proof that Aus
tralian prosperity is due to primary produc-
tion in spite of industries which should never
have been fostered. Again, he quotes List
as having said that the tropics are non-manu-
facturing and non-competitive ; . and from
this the remarkable economist infers that
\ustralia (whose settled portions are
mainly outside the tropics) should be also
non-manufacturing and non-competitive.
Further, he asserts that Australian prosper-
ity is largely dependent on the markets of
Europe, and yet ignores the fact that Aus-
tralian manufactures, fostered by Protection,
mav help to make us independent of those
markets. But Pulsford can do better than
draw false deductions from ascertained fact.
In a later paragraph he makes the state-
ment that, though Australia gives to the I ro-
tectionist politician and manufacturer th«
power to break down the imports, and
hough they have tried to exercise that
nnwer, the flood of imnorts still increases.
The truth, of course, is that it is because
politicians have not used their power that
imports are increasing. Finally, the busted
economist makes the usual remarks of a
Freetrader about the increased cost of liv-
ing. but characteristically fails to note that
while it costs a lot more to live, the people
have never been so well able to pay that
cost and to take their best girl to the picture
show after it has been paid. Also, he fails
to observe that the increased cost is very
largely due to increased rents, which are
mainly due to the congestion of certain
towns, which is mainly due to the policy
favored by the party of which Pulsford is
one of the latest remnants.
The Pacific Naval Problem.
Richard Arthur, M.L.A., writes : —-
Your article, “To Safety—with Danger in the
Road,’’ has fully persuaded me that, for some years
to come, the fate of Australia may be decided in the
North Sea. Japan will strike at Australia if opportu-
nity offers, just as it struck at Russia. But the pre-
liminary and essential condition is that Great Britain’s
hands must be tied. Japan would not dare to move as
long as the British fleet was in being in the North
Sea. The statesmen of Nippon could not venture to as-
sume that the fleet was tied immovably there. Germany
is not going to war simply to pull chestnuts out of the
fire for Japan. In fact, a Japanese attack on Australia
might bring about an Anglo-German alliance to com-
bat the Yellow Peril, which the Kaiser foresaw 20
years ago. On the other hand, should Great Britain
and Germany come to a death grip in the North Sea,
Japan’s psychological moment would have arrived with
a vengeance. At its leisure it could throw 100,000
veteran troops and more into Queensland, and with
that as a base over-run the whole continent.
It clearly follows that, for some years to come,
Australia’s true defence lies in the existence of over-
whelming British naval superiority in the North Sea
and Mediterranean. In the meantime Australia’s chief
business is to so increase its population that its ex-
panding revenue may allow the building of super-
Dreadnoughts at once. According to the Henderson
programme, our next battleship is not due till 1920,
which is ridiculous. We should order two more at
once and a dozen submarines, which are being recog-
nised as the best form of coastal defence.
Later on, Australia and Maoriland must stand on
their own feet. It is folly to depend on Canada or
the United States. Canada knows well that it is in
a very different position to what we are, and is, there-
fore, not called upon to make the same sacrifices for
its existence. It knows that it has the United States
fleet behind it should any aggression on its territory be
attempted. Whether the States would move to our
aid from sentimental motives is another question alto-
gether. The Yankee Government might, however, have
a far more weighty argument brought to bear on it.
It might be told plainly by the British Government
that, unless the United States were prepared to play
the part of a “good white” in the Pacific, Great
Britain would no longer remain the tacit upholder of
the Monroe Doctrine, and would refuse to interfere
with any designs that Germany might have on South
America. That would bring the great Republic to a
sense of its moral obligations quicker than anything
else.
Finally, I again maintain that the programme
should be: The Australasian Dreadnoughts in the
North Sea for some years to come, the quadrupling of
the present immigration stream, more battleships to
be ordered at once, and three or six months’ con-
tinuous training for our citizen army.
And The Bulletin merely repeats its old
opinion that while it is good to have gaols
to hold the burglars, and policemen to patrol
the street, it is wise to also have a lock
on your own door. Wherefore, while Great
Britain ought to be relieved of all expense
in the protection of these parts, so that it
might devote every available penny to its
preparations in the North Sea and Medi-
terranean, Australia ought to keep its
Dreadnoughts. They are the lock on our
door.
A Serious Flaw in Defence.
“Don Q.’s” informative volley :
The three military rifles with which the three great
English-speaking races hope to defend their lands
are: —
(1) The Springfield rifle (United States) ;
(2) The Ross rifle (Canada) ;
(3) The Lee-Enfield Mark 111. (British Empire).
The Canadian Military Gazette, commenting on the
Palma trophy competition (perhaps the greatest rifle
shooting match in the world), recently stated that the
Springfield rifle completely outclassed the Ross rifle.
Now, recall the riot at the last Bisley competitions
over the question whether the Canadians should be
permitted to fire with the superior Ross weapon, and
you see where we are with the Lee-Enfield Mark 111.
as compared with the Springfield. Australia’s small-
arms factory was opened a few months ago, and Min-
ister Pearce iterated that it had the most up-to-date
rifle plant in the world. Well, why is the most up-to-
date plant turning out a third-rate article? Six
months ago it was announced that Britain had decided
to refit its army with a rifle which Colonel Seely, of
the War Office,' told the Commons would be equal to
the world’s best. The intention of the War Office was
to put 100 of the new rifles in the hands of army ex-
perts, so that thorough and practical tests might be
made. Where was our Department when those
samples were handed out ? Having adopted the policy
of blindly accepting any old recommendation of the
conservative British Y/ar Office, it was surely up to
our people to smell a rat or an elephant when the dis-
carding of the Mark 111. was made known by the
W.O. The Springfield military rifle (admittedly the
best in the world, and made in the U.S. by that use-
less fraud, Socialism) has a muzzle velocity of 2750 ft.
per second; trajectory, 800 yards. The text-book
says of the wretched Mark 111. that its muzzle velocity
is' 2000 ft. per second. The trajectory is not given,
but experts quote it at 600 yards. But although the
velocity is put down at 2000 ft., it is actually some-
what less. In the Mark 111. type, the breech mechan-
ism was found so weak that the cordite charge had to
be reduced to avoid the blowing-out of breech blocks.
This weakness our Lithgow factory may have remedied,
but I do not think so. The first two rifles made there
have a better finish than the imported article; but
finish and alteration of type are two different things.
I ask the Minister for Defence these questions: (1)
How many thousands of the Mark 111. rifles does his
factory propose to manufacture? (2) Has the factory
strengthened the breech mechanism of this type? (3)
What steps has the Department taken in the matter of
producing an up-to-date Australian type of weapon?
(4) Will his Department obtain a sample of the Spring-
field rifle, England’s latest rifle, and the most modern
Continental military rifle, with the object of providing
Australia with a first-class weapon ?
Bigjohn Forrest has been tying himself
into a large knot in the West. As a Fusion-
ist he had, of course, to curse the Labor
Government and the Referenda proposals.
Things had been going to perdition, said
Bigjohn, “and the Referenda proposals were
the last straw that broke the camel’s back.”
The Labor party “would destroy itself in
time” ; but just now Socialism was bringing
loss and ruin on the State, and if the Refer-
enda proposals were carried they “might as
well throw up the sponge.” That was Big-
john talking in the usual large, vague way
at a political meeting. But presently the
same Bigjohn was switched on to propose
“The State and Trade of Westralia” at the
opening of a new warehouse, and this is how
he did it: —
D and W. Murray, Ltd., had shown great enter-
prise in building such a magnificent structure. The
co had shown not only its faith in the country, but
had also given an indication of the prosperity that
had come to Westralia during recent years.
Then Bigjohn proceeded to quote figures to
prove that the man who had told the vague
yarn about tottering camels and last straws
and ruin and sponges had been pulling the
fool-public’s leg. How long will the electors
stand this sort of flagrant political dishonesty
in its public men?
The familiar yarns about the “good old
times” were uncorked once more at Welling-
ton (M.L.) the other day, when the windy
place had an anniversary. It was a bit of
bad luck that on this occasion figures were
given which permit one to test the quality of
those alleged good times. In 1545 tjie Public
Service at Wellington numbered 34, with
salaries ranging from £BOO to £4O. The
average works out at £l57 —not as much as
the average flax-cutter can knock out now.
Then, taking the import returns, a few values
run out this way: Butter, Is. 3d.; flour,
£2O 155.; wheat, 10s. (bushel) ; potatoes, £7
(ton) ; coal, £4 (ton) ; bacon, Bd. These
prices are worked out on the declared values
for Customs tax purposes, and at least 50
p.c. must be fastened on to arrive at the
retail price. Where, then, do the “good
times” come in? A man got much less pay,
and, on these figures, he also got less tucker,
etc., for the little pay that he did get. He
simply pulled through because, poor clod, his
“wants” were few. The youngster didn’t ask
for jam because it didn’t know that jam was
any more obtainable than slices of the moon.
But it didn’t follow that the youngster
wouldn’t have liked jam ; and life is a very
different thing for the youngster now that
there is jam.
When a company cannot pay a larger divi-
dend than 10 p.c., in addition to carrying a
big sum over to visible reserves and stuffing
other sums into invisible funds, its affairs
are beginning to look rather blu|e. At least,
such is the natural inference from the re-
marks of W. C. Goddard, chairman of the
Sydney Ferries, who has just declared that
there must be “a limit beyond which the
company cannot go,” and has foretold an
increase in the price charged for periodical
tickets. The real trouble appears to be not
that the company is not paying decent re-
turns on the original capital, but that it is
not paying enough to those who, speculating
on the city’s congestion, have recently pur-
chased shares at big prices. The question
which the directors of the concern naturally
ask is why the Sydney landlord should have
the game all to himself, when those who own
the means of transit between the houses of
the people and their daily work have an
equally important monopoly by means of
which they can squeeze the public. The pub-
lic is a slow beast, and its vision is limited,
but the last word of the Sydney Ferries
should awaken a large number of those who
take their daily risks on the harbor to a
knowledge of the fact that a congestion
policy is merely promoted for their plunder,
and that the increase in the cost of periodi-
cal tickets on the boats is a mere nothing
to some other things that will come along if
the congestionists are given a free hand.
V
The Bulletin receives from Queensland a
circular headed “Federal Secession Fund,”
appealing for money to “eventually over-
throw this absurd Federal form of govern-
ment.” The promoters don’t mention what
sort of guns they are going to buy ; but it
is made clear that they want to restore the
old order and “deliver the glorious States
out of the hands of the political Philistines.”
Incidentally, and as the great reason why
the fund should be established, it is said
that “Mr. T. A. Dibbs recently attributed
the failure to raise a paltry three millions
by N. S. Wales to the eviction of Lord Den-
man and the pernicious clauses in the Gas
Bill.” The brilliant asses who issue the
circular evidently don’t know that Denman
is G.-G. of the Commonwealth, and that it
was a blow aimed at the Commonwealth
which, in Dibbs’s opinion, disgusted Cohen.
Also, thev apparently don’t know that the
Gas Bill was a State matter, and their pro-
posal is to give the States more powers so
that they may introduce still more of these
disastrous measures. In fact, as a sample
of muddle-headedness the “Federal Seces-
sion Fund” circular is almost unique even
in State Fright literature —and that is say-
ing a good deal.
While a necessity, until mankind devises
a better medium of exchange, the industry
of getting gold out of the earth is an econo-
mic foolishness. Millions of men all the
world over, aided by hundreds of millions of
capital, are engaged in digging holes in the
ground, dredging rivers, removing moun-
tains, pounding hard rocks to sand, and em-
ploying every device that engineering and
chemical science can supply, and the out-
come of it all is the winning of a metal that
is for all practical purposes of considerably
less value.than brass. After all, what man-
kind wants during its sojourn below is
tucker and clothes and houses and motor-
cars and picture shows, and all sorts of
other things that give comfort and happi-
ness and knowledge and amusement and
general welfare, and what we are here for
in the long run is to each do our share in
producing these things. Intrinsically the
shining bits of metal we call sovereigns are
much less valuable in this respect than
trouser buttons; and the discovery of some-
thing better than gold as the medium of. ex-
change would set free a lot of enterpiising,
intelligent and industrious people to pro-
duce the things mankind really wants, in-
stead of material'for the counters that re-
present those things. For instance, about
20 men, two suction gas-engines, a battery
and various accessories, several horses and
drays and a few dogs (interested but not
active participants) toil madly for a fort-
nightly yield that consists of a bar of yellow
metal very considerably smaller than half a
brick, which bar, if it were not that gold
is the medium of exchange, would probably
be of less value than a similar bar of lead.
Somehow, it doesn’t seem a commensurate
return for so much industry and intelligence
and perspiration and bad language. The re-
former who will devise a system whereby
such energy will be directed to producing
useful things, instead of their common de-
nominator, will be of more service than a
State Governor. A lot of good tucker and
clothing and tools and other items is use-
lessly converted into unnecessary and dan-
gerous holes in the ground by the unfortu-
nate practice of looking for gold in the place
where it isn’t, and if gold wasn’t WPrth
looking for people would soon grow out of
this wasteful habit.

The S. M. Herald continues to find joy in
the Australian navy, and particularly in the
fact that Sydney is to reap the benefits
which belong to a first-class naval port. It
is cheerful to find the Tory thus coining
into line with national thought, even though
his vision is a little obscured by an ecstatic
dream of the further congestion of Sydney.
But although the Herald has been con-
verted there is nothing of humility or con-
trition about its attitude. Assuming the
pose of omniscience, it leaves its readers to
infer that it has all the time been in favor
of a local navy, but at the same time warns
Australia that, although the fleet unit which
is being constructed is an excellent thing for
Port Jackson, and useful in that it removes
a burden from the British taxpayer, it really
doesn’t of itself amount to a row of pins in
the matter of defence. Referring to the
recent keel-laying and rivet-driving at
Cockatoo Island, the Tory paper thus de-
livers its soul: —
If the British navy loses its supremacy, for some
time ahead at least, no effort that our population can
make could ensure us more than temporary safety
against even a second-class Power.
This may he true, or it may not. But if it
is only half true it is the kind of implied
challenge to which the Commonwealth can
give but one answer. If our best effort can-
not in certain circumstances insure our
safety, our second-best effort must in most
cases secure our speedy damnation.
• —♦-
Bast week there landed back in Sydney a
grazier whose mouth was full of praise of
the green Argentina fields that are blessed
and fertilised by Private Enterprise. The
S. M. Herald very naturally gave him his
head, and he got off the old gags that “go”
as splendidly as nigger minstrel chestnuts.
His remarks may be compressed into this
form :
(1) Private Enterprise is encouraged, and “great
development” has resulted.
(2) Capital is “pouring” into the country.
(3) There are 5000 miles of railway in course of
construction, and all the lines, with one or two small
exceptions, are privately owned. It is difficult to
make comparisons as regards fares and freights, but
he thinks both are a little cheaper than in Australia.
(4) There is a land tax which is used for Defence
purposes, but “it is not excessive.”
(5) There are not many Englishmen in the country.
But there are over 2,000,000 Italians and large num-
bers of Russians.
(6) The producers told him that “up to the pre-
sent” the Beef Trust had helped and not hindered
them.
(7) Where Australia has “only little patches of rich
land, the Argentine has hundreds of miles. If they
had all their, lands in use, and knew how to farm pro-
perly—the majority of the farmers in the Argentine
are backward in this respect —it would be a bad look-
out for us, for they could almost keep the whole
World going.”
Is the Herald becoming reckless in its old
age, or didn’t it notice that its traveller was
loaded? The average Australian, reading
hurriedly in a jolting tram, would probably
sum it up this way:—
(H Despite all the encouragement to Private En-
terprise and the consequent “great development,” the
country has not attracted the Britisher in quantities.
It has only managed to acquire 2,000,000 Italians
and a large number of Russians.
(2) Capital is “pouring” into the country—-despite
a land tax!
(3) The returned voyager is not certain whether
the P.E. railway fares and freights are cheaper than
on the Government-owned lines of Australia. Either
he is a slinshod investigator, or he has no striking
figures to offer.
(4) The land is taxed to provide for Defence—-and
Argentina’s Defence is not to be despised. Loud
applause if the reader is not directly interested in
land.
(5) Not many Englishmen in the countrv. Then
the Argentine policy is not tending to the enthusiastic
celebration of Empire Day. Impossible place for a
fervent loyalist.
(6) The Beef Trust, up to the present, has helped
and not hindered the producer. This fits in with the
worst stories told about it. The Droducer is slimed
before being swallowed.
(7) When Argentina pours in a few more
millions of people and uses its vast lands to their
utmost capacity, where will far-off Australia stand
when the markets for its raw products are lost?
Won’t it be rather late then for the S. M. Herald to
barrack for Protection and Australian industries?
Still the S. M. Herald can’t be bothered
with such problems. The dear old soul may
be expected to just heave a patient sigh and
get on with the mending of the Liberal
patty’s socks.
From the Stipendiary Corporal:—
In Constantinople Enver Bey sits very tight, lis-
tening to the Allies screaming bluff beyond the lines
of Chataldja. But Enver knows it is bluff, and that
if armed intervention can be stalled off the Allies
are beaten. Bulgaria’s ruler has forbidden the publi-
cation of the returns of killed and wounded. Ac-
cording to Philip Gibbs, of the Graphic., the number
was “semi-officially” announced as approximately
70,000, and he thinks it was more. But even
70,000 means one in every four wounded or killed
and, when Bulgaria realises the awful extent of that
toll, what a wailing there will be! To quote Gibbs
some more, the Bulgarian “victories were io expen-
sive, in human life, that, in spite of their rapidity,
they almost failed in their effect.... Like sprinters
in a race they had run themselves out”—and by the
time they had recovered their wind Chataldja was
well-nigh impregnable, and fresh troops were pouring
in from Asia Minor. If the Turk can hang out a
few more weeks, the Allies will be glad to make peace
on almost any terms.

announced his intention of presenting, or
“Sweet County Kerry” at the
Theatre Royal, on Saturday, the 15th.
The Doone season of “pretty” plays at
the Palace will end to-morrow night with
the last performance of “Old Donegal.” On
Saturday William Anderson will commence
a five-weeks’ distribution of drama, the first

Bitter words from “Henri Singemoine” :—-
In the golden days when all the World rode
bicycles, and ladies affected small straw hats tilted
rakishly over their noses, , and everyone was many
years younger, the vogue .was for the Beautiful in
dancing, as in so many other things. Letty Lind,
sister of Australia’s inimitable Fan Dango, discov-
ered the uses of the voluminous skirt, and in one dis-
tracting act slew the business of the conventional
ballerina dead. Every second well-to-do female,
with decent feet and ankles, proceeded to acquire the
new allurement. Thousands of drawing-rooms re-
sounded daily and nightly fo the ponderous boundings
and sickening falls of maidens absorbed in well-
meant strivings to be swan-like. Willowy bendings,
now to this side, now to that; graceful little runs
here and there; demure, though somewhat purpose-
less, leaps in the air; a waving of white arms
and a constant exposure of even whiter teeth —these
were the lovelinesses that charmed us in Home and
Theatre alike during the ’9o’s.
But who aspires to be ‘swan-like in these stark
times ? No , one! Our women golf in any old
clothes and the thickest of boots; drive motor-cars;
surf-bathe till they are brown, if not black, in the
face; and as a result of it all they are adding to
their stature and brawn with awful speed. The

stage, as always, reflects the tendency of the period.
Consider, for example, the *Gaby Glide, now being
perpetrated nightly at Her Majesty's Theatre, Syd-
ney. What would the genteel critics of 20 years
ago have sa-'d about it ? What indeed! As a mat-
ter of fact, it is calculated to cause even one hard-
ened by scores of visits to Coogee and Manly, and
inured to the ways of ballrooms where the practices
of London’s Grafton Galleries are imitated, to sit up
and take a certain amount of notice. Its dominant
note is hideousness. It suggests a corroboree at La
Perouse, a “oush” revel at a harbor-side pleasure
resort, the aanse du ventre of old Port Said or
modern Paris, and a mult'tude of other ungraceful
movements. It is enough to make Terpsichore turn
in her grave.
Some questions that occur to the astounded on-
looker are: (1) Why does Gabv elect to glide in this
weirdly unalluring fashion? (*2) Did ex-King Manoel
of Portugal ever see her at it,' and, if so, how is it
he wasn’t immediately “choked off” for life? (3)
What appeal does it make to the public? I have
never seen Gaby Deslys in action. She may execute
her glide in such a fashion as to render it attractive.
Some women (about one in a million) are like all
children, inasmuch as they are unable to look un-
graceful in any circumstances. There are no
females of this sort at Her Majesty’s. The galvanic
grins, the brief, lumbering hand-gallops from place
to place, the preposterous wagglings of those who
commit the Gaby Glide are merely repulsive. They

are such manoeuvres as might have been performed
by the first cave family that discovered the secret
of brewing: strong drink, and, partaking thereof, felt
the necessity of working off the effects.
The Buzzing Bee turn is along similar lines. One
party to the offence canters briskly in the direction
of the other, who thereupon sprints up-stage, and
two or three times round it; both amble towards each
other, close and sing a stave or two—interesting,
possibly, to bee-keepers and apiologists generally,
but carrying no significance to the average member
of the public—after which they perform a clean
break, and repeat the process anew. There is no-
thing beautiful, or quaint, or skilful, or artistically
satisfying about it. Anyone possessed of a fair
amount of nerve or hide, and a sound pair of legs,
could do it after a couple of hours’ practice. Like
the One-step, the Bunny Hug, the Turkey Trot, and
all their offshoots, it is anarchistic. It knows no
definite laws. The only essential is to keep moving.
For the rest, if one of the principals climbed into
the flies, and leapt therefrom through a trap-door
in the stage, and so out to the nearest bar, in pur-
suit of drink, the procedure would arouse no com-
ment. He would return to find his partner still
buzzing, and the audience satisfied that all was well.
And probably, as he resumed his duties, the lady
herself would not suspect that anything unusual had
happened to their dance but for the wanderer’s
newly-acquired odor of alcohol. ;

plus a certain amount of grotesquerie. It is a new

dance in the sense only that a waltz would be new
if the parties interrupted the conventional steps by
throwing hand-springs or kicking each other. The
lady swathes herself in the customary shawl-like gar-
ment of old Madrid, bashes a gigantic black velvet
hat over her eyes, and strikes one of those aloof,
repellent attitudes which characterise the stage senor-
hita. Her accomplice does his best to look like a
hidalgo. They paw the boards in unison, while the band
supplies music of the “Toreador"’ brand. Then the
Tango proper begins. Thrusting one leg forward the
male executes a scride of outrageous length. The
female backs on the same lines. The movement
brings them to their knees. They thereupon get up
and repeat the feat, and continue to do so, witn
brief intervals of dancing, till the orchestra cries
enough, or the audience yawns, or throws missiles.
If it is a dance, then the writer is prepared to hear
serious argument in favor of the view that a stout
duck fleeing from the poulterer is the performer of
steps which are worthy of human imitation.
The dead finish of repulsiveness is reached, how-
ever, in the Political Ballet. Boiled down to its
first essentials it simply amounts to, the melancholy
spectacle of four elderly men publicly debasing them-
selves. That there is no vestige of attractiveness
about their gyrations the degraded quartet would
probably be themselves the first to admit. Nor is
there any real novelty in their turn. The humor,
such as it is, consists in the unnaturally clumsy exe-
cution of time-dishonored movements which a pretty
and graceful woman finds it hard, even after earnest
practice, to render tolerable to modern eyes. The
people who are diverted by the sight of Bantock
crashing down-stage, in brief skirts and a full-
bottomed wig, would be highly amused to see a stout
man falling heavily off a tram. And one had imag-
ined that the catastrophic variety of jest—the sort
that reposes broad-based on the public humiliation
of some inoffensive fellow-mortal—had perished
with the decay of the zest for practical-joking l
Presumably these demented burlesques of an art
which, during upwards of 30 centuries, has aimed
chieflv at grace and allurement, meet some deep-
seated public need. In that case the need should
be inquired into, as one would investigate an out-
break of measles or chicken-pox. A Liberal friend
of mine attributes it to the Labor party, the onrush
of Socialism, and indifferentism as regards the cele-
bration of Empire Day. I only hope and pray that
h:s diagnosis may prove faulty.
The play with the best “drawing” nntriQ
(“The Monk and the Woman”) that ha!
flared on Sydney’s electric night-signs for a
long time will not be produced at the Adel
phi after to-morrow. The Marlow manage'
ment will follow it on Saturday with “The
Beggar Girl’s Wedding,” the chief lesson of
which will be the happiness that comes
from avoiding the temptations that befall
guileless men when a beautiful woman
crosses his track. This ought to give the
press a chance to invite the bookmakers of
Sydney to attend the show and express their
opinions in 160-odd columns of print It’s
time the over-exploited parsons had a rest.

Miss Rosie Lloyd, comedienne, who com-
mands a slice of the Afternoon Teavoli pro-
gramme this week, is one of those ladies who
have a celebrated relative, and prop them-
selves up against her name. She is billed
as “sister of the famous Marie Lloyd,” though
the lady might be her grand-aunt for all the
difference it makes. As with most of “Eng-
land’s Most Celebrated Comediennes” and
there are hundreds of them—her repertoire
consists of a few songs (all or most about
kissing) and a set of teeth; and the teeth
are the biggest success. On the other hand
Will Poluski, jun., another English come-
dian, is the real thing, and about tops the
poll of recent comedians who have labored
under the “famous English” label. Welsh
and Louise Carbasse—who shine in a new
sketch, “A Terrible Fix”—and Marshall
Crossby, a baritone with a good voice, are
enjoying a second time on Mclntosh’s earth.
Prominent among the also-rans are the
Staley and Birkbeck musicians, the Lanca-
shire Opera Co.. Maxini Bros., the Pattv
Franks and My Fancy.
The earth tremors and upheavals in vari-
ous parts of the Crystal Palace have not
affected the picture show, and it flicks on
just the same. This week an eye-opener in
the form of a Panama Canal film is un-
wound ; although it takes well over the hour,
it is most interesting throughout. The huge
steam shovels, the grabs, the tremendous
concrete works and the locks land- Uncle
Sam’s new canal a length or two in front of
the seven wonders. At the Colonial, Hussein
the Pirate has been providing a passable
film; and the mirror show at the Palace
annexe is still proving a success.
The five Olracs have arrived at the
National Amphitheatre. They are expert
fallers. They fall over everything with the
completest impartiality. They are capable
of falling over any article, obstruction or
other circumstance, dead or alive, from a
worm to a cathedral. There has been no-
thing like their turn since Lord Brassey
ceased to represent his Sovereign in these
parts. The Delinos are different, inasmuch
as they do not fall off anything. They walk
on wire, perform tricks on bicycles, and so
on. Always the audience watches expectant
that one of them may break his neck, or at
least a leg. In vain. However, it is possi-
ble to ask too much of our hired entertain-
ers. . The Era Comedy Four are still being
received kindly, and the Prunes and Miss
Nellie Morrison merit a subdued shriek of
praise.
“The Taming of the Shrew” is Shak-
epeare after the own inner heart of human-
kind : boisterous broad comedy to suit both
sexes ; full of action; spiced with exaggera-
tion ; dressed in the raiment that (for all
its pompous superfluities and “class” con-
trasts) remains in sympathy with modern
fashions; and strong in touches of eternal
nature. Petruchio is the typical masterful
brute , whom women secretly adore, whilst
rejoicing that his methods are out of date.
Katherine stands for the hot-blooded she
whom every man would conquer if he could.
The self-assertion of Bianca and the Widow
as soon as they are married strikes the four
sections of the adult population in their
respective senses of humor. The hopeful
spinster giggles, the fatuous bachelor laughs,
the matron holds her tongue in her cheek,
and the old man grins reminiscently. The
arrangement of “The Shrew” which Asche
staged again at Melbourne Royal last Sat-
urday brings, out all, or nearly all. (hat is
best in the disorderly comedy, and dispenses
with the incidental lumber of it. Moreover,
his wonderful make-up and convincing air of
besotted bewilderment as Tinker Sly in the
induction restore Asche to notice in his best
character part. Old Christopher, the malo-
dorous son of Beer, is a revolting person, but
in his. embodiment of the inductory joke he
is sufficiently clean and wholesome.
A few changes in the cast since “The
Shrew was first produced at the Royal, 3 i
years ago, make very little disimprovement
in the result. Warlock is a tame, grave
Lucentio who doesn’t speak his lines as dis-
tinctly as Kay Souper did, yet he is an
admirably nice young man. The Bianca of
Miss Lilian Birtles, although rather weak,
is pleasing enough. And Arthur Trantom,
as Gru.mio, succeeds in talking and looking
v ei T like his more weighty predecessor,
Athol Forde. A moving shadow in the
mummer row, he echoes foggy sounds of
long ago. Oscar Asche is, of course, his own
distinctive self again in the 10-league boots


When faded Ada Ward, the “actress evangelist,’’
publicly renounced Wowserism’, at Sydney Town Hall,
some months ago, the one thing she lacked was a
descriptive title for her long moan about the frozen
shoulder of the back-street saints she was parting
from. The S. M. Herald supplied the want last week
in a paragraph re the sale of the Criterion Theatre.
It mentioned that George Hill, when landlord of the
little playhouse, spent £BOOO upon it in 1892, “just
before the Brourh and Boucicault production of
‘Much Ada About Nothing.’ ”

This is the seventh week of the panto at
Her Majesty’s, and still it prospers. The
brisk young she-boy, the stolid she-dame, the
cat, the stony-broke King and his mild
Princess daughter, continue to bear the heat
and burden of the entertainment what times
it is not otherwise engaged. Seeing that 350
people are alleged to take part in the pro-
duction, the share of heat and burden that
falls upon the principals can hardly be over-
taxing their powers of endurance.
“No Mother to Guide Her” will supply
the managerial want at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s for another week or two, so there is
plenty of time for its burglary interest to
be brought right up to date. Thusfar, the
police who burst upon the scene when rob-
bery and murder are suspected have for-
gotten to ’phone for the finger-print expert,
but this oversight, after all, doesn’t count
for much in comparison with their neglect
to arrest the red-frocked donah who changed
clothes with the heroine whilst she was
waiting to be hanged. The limit of police
inefficiency is reached in the reigning attrac-
tion at the Princess’s. The limit of several
other things is reached, for that matter, and
one might rake the astounding narrative
with a small-tooth comb without finding
aught that would look barely possible under
a microscope.

There is more of Mat Gabbett and less of
the Rev. John North in the new version of
“The Term of His Natural Life” which
transpired at Melbourne King’s on Satur-
day. The rev. gent, is an unusually fitful
apparition in the painful story, but Gabbett
is early introduced into the first act, and is
the moyipg spirit in a plot to capture the
ship—very well painted, by the way, by
Rege Robins and his assistants. Gabbett is
really almost as important as good Rufus
Dawes or bad Captain Maurice Frere, who
wallops the convict population beyond the
limit of forbearance. Charlie Taylor plays
the man-chewing Gabbett, and Charlie’s
habit of looking on his weaker brethren as
prospective ingredients in a stew or a
rissole gives him a very fair standing as an
animal impersonator. Captain Maurice
Frere, the private rotter and public calam-
ity, is acted by Herbert Lee, who supplies a
mere stencilling of other people’s work in
the part. Kenneth Brampton’s portrait of
the Rev. North is rather the frame without
the picture, and “good Mr. Dawes” is one
of Roy Redgrave’s classic bloques given to
Hamlet-like brooding and self-analysis. The
convincing Redgrave, however, does not for-
get the claims of bellowdrama, for he has a
manner of revealing his sufferings by grease-
painting his visage with bruises of black
and weals of red until his countenance looks
kc the plan of a Bulgar battlefield. John
xtex, tne had egg who slays his parent, is in
the hands of Walter Dalgleish; Cannam is
the same insistent libel on Mr. Meakin; and
iiiss Helen Fergus is a decorative Lady
As Sarah Purfoy and Sylvia Vick-
ei s, Alisses Florence Itichter and Vera liemee
are respectively passable, though both are
sweetly ineffective when the situation calls
tor an emotional demonstration. Though
the play dates back to the infant years
or last century, both ladies also gown
themselves in the latest fashions, and even
in scenes when no display is allowable they
still indulge in sartorial swank.
At the Opera House the last nights of De
Biere have lasted a fortnight, and on Satur-
day they will finish their course. Which re-
mark applies also to the farewells of Nella
Webb. _ The bounding Arabs continue to
tumble in all directions when they are not
zoug-zouging in pyramidal forms; Kitchen
and loy are still shedding their outer gar-
ments under gymnastic conditons; and
Mario, thfe contortionist, is treating his rub-
ber backbone with unmerited contempt.
Last week the P’ran Lyric (Vic.) was
still uncurling “The Count of Monte Cristo”
and giving a very good display of the popu-
lar story. Among other films in the run-
ning was “The New York Hat,” wherein
the presentation of v a chapeau to a lovely
maiden leads to. the local parson being
charged with giddy behavior. To The
Bulletin’s great relief, the pilot was found
not guilty of any wicked intention. “Mr.
Up’s Trip Tripped Up” was a comedy with
a plot as clear as Jokook’s policy; while
“Fraud at the Hope Mine” related a yarn
of robbery and malice with a nice girl to
provide the emotional trimmings. Also,
there was a picture of Mahaddin (Africa),
wherein the screen was sprinkled with be-
nighted Sambos disfigured by wrinkles, dirt
and obesity.
Last Saturday West’s Melbourne support-
ers were entertained by “The Girl Without
a Country,” a damsel who attempted to pinch
a nation’s .secret at the behest of a gentle-
manly foreign person. How the girl got
on in her appointed espionage is well nar-
rated in a film which, without showing
genius as a piece of fiction, is yet nearly a
masterpiece in emotional particulars. The
hugger-mugger throughout is cutely por-
trayed by a Danish actress, Asta Nielsen,
who uses the incendiary glance with deadly
effect. “A Noise Like a Fortune” was
merely the din of money talking at the top
of its voice; while “The Water Rats” re-
vealed a burglarious rodent with a strong
strain of piety and a good, kind ’eart. Strange
how all the burglars in motion plays have
the inconvenience called Conscience and a
tendency to wowse on the slightest provo-
cation !
Quantities of the population continue to
stroll into the enclosure at St. Kilda (Vic.)
where the Smart Setters are giving their
vocal displays at prices of an extremely
popular character. The programme was
changed as usual last Friday, a feature of
the new bill being the sketch, “When They
Go On the Stage,” by Walter George and
Miss Georgie Martin, who Spoke as if they
were talking by well-oiled machinery. Among
those who are graciously permitted to stray
into this par. are Oswald Preston, who
warbled “The Young Carbineer”; Miss
Emily Kroll, who sang “My Moon”; and
Edgar Hulland. who attacked Liszt’s Pol-
onaise with a placid contemnt for its techni-
cal difficulties. Edward Elliott, the ven-
triloauial comic, also hawked forth “Mr.
Sunshine James,” and made the object con-
verse with Cockney impertinence.

The Anderson season of melodrama at
Adelaide Royal unexpectedly ran into five
weeks, and was so successful in a quiet way
that Herbert Myers entertained tbe whole
crowd at the finish and said pleasant things
about them. The Royal is now taking a
holiday, and Mabel Hardinge has the dra-
matic field to herself with “East Lynne” at
the Tivoli. The King’s has the variety field
to itself. Paul Gorden, wonder of the wire,
has gone; but Miss Brooke is still causing
Woman to gasp at the monstrous fashions
she was content to wear day-before-yester-
day, and great chief Lone Eagle has come
in with his war-dance and wampum and
other assets. Weather slightly warmer has
been good for the open-air Dandies and
Wondergraph pictures, which show a re-
markably-faked Biblical deluge. West’s also
revel in Death, with the grim Retreat from
Moscow. The Empire trumps the other
houses’ death-pictures. It puts up “Resurrec-
tion.” But not Gabriel’s variety. Not even
moving-picture audacity has come to that
rof
AT POVERTY POINT.
Frank Musgrove has bought Sydney Criterion
Theatre freehold for, it is said, £60,000. This in-
cludes the hotel, shops and some frontage in Park-
street. The sale is subject to a lease, with three
years to run, to J. C. Williamson, Ltd. The Bank
of N. S. Wales was the vendor. The theatre was
built originally by the Hill estate, the family of
which Dan Cooper’s wife was a member. It occu-
pied the site of the old Glasgow Inn, at the rear of
which was a fine old house, the private residence in
years past of the Coopers and the Hills.
Melba’s alleged fee of £40,000 for a series of
concerts in ’Murka and Canada next autumn is likely
to be the last of her very big hauls. The great Aus-
tralian Voice had lost some of its original force,
compass and fluency, and even a little of its beauti-
ful color, before Melba left here for Europe a few
months ago. When it has gone further on the down
grade the English-speaking world will hardly con-
tinue to adore Melba as old Patti was adored long
after the glory of her warble had departed. For
that matter Patti’s final American engagement was a
heavy loss to the speculators, and the little woman
released them from their contract.
“Monkbarns”: “Taming the Shrew” is put on
again by Asche. Until Benson did better, for about
a century the stage had been held by Garrick’s
mangled version, the uproarious farce in two acts
called “Katherine and Petruchio.” (Maybe Phelps
staged the right thing.) Irving and Ellen Terry first
acted together as Petruchio and Katherine. Irving
got £7 a week, and Ellen £l5. Petruchio was the
last character acted by Brooke at the Melbourne
Olympic. But the Induction was only once given in
that city before Asche did it. This once was by the
Garrick Club, in 1864. For an after-piece the club gave
“The Merchant of Venice,” with Sam Banks, the
comp., as Shylock.
“Melb”: Asche rehearses “Midsummer Night’s
Dream.” Though popular now, it was not much
acted till almost in our own time. Pepys wrote of
it that it was the sorriest stuff he ever saw or heard.
Probably half was cut out, and the other half
gagged. The first Melbourne production traceable
was at the Princess’s: Bottom, Jefferson; Theseus,
Fitzgerald; Lysander. Heir; Demetrius, Ireland;
Puck, Julia Edouin; Egeus, Harwood ; Quince, Lam-
bert ; Flute. Stewart; Oberon, Emma Neville ; Titania,
Dolly Green; Hermia, Mrs. Heir; Helena, Ro3a
Dunn. It was not seen again until Rignold’s pro-
duction, in which George acted Bottom, with Hilda
Spong as Titania, and Miss Russell as Puck. Other
parts were taken by Keightley, Sweeney, Whyte,
Hazlitt and Rignold’s other well-known myrmidons.
The third and last production was by Musgrove and
Courtneidge: Bottom, Denny; Theseus, Bucklaw;
Oberon, Dora Rignold; Titania, Nora Kerin.
From London: “Captain Penfold,” described as
“an Australian aeronaut,” went up in a balloon in
London on Christmas Eve, to advertise Sandow’s
cocoa and chocolates. Dressed as Old Father Christ-
mas, he sat on the edge of the basket, and nearly
came to grief at the start, only missing a collision
with a gasometer by a few inches. He intended to
descend by parachute in Hyde Park, and distribute
chocolates free among the crowd. But the wind blew
him right out of London into the county of Essex.
At the alleged height of 3000 ft. he parted company
with the balloon and dropned 400 ft. before the para-
chute opened. When he landed—in a field —he was
unconscious for 10 minutes. After that he presented
his chocolates to a little crowd of agricultural
kiddies.

PRINCESS’S.

the bad ’un (with

hobbies).
“Jerong”: Bulletin (9/l/’l3) records the death
at Wanganui (M.L.) of W. H. Thornton, Sophie
Vaughan’s father. I first knew Thornton and his
wife on Lambing Flat (N.S.W.). She was a Red-
fern girl. This was in the early part of 1861. In
those days Thornton was known among the diggers
as “the "scenic artist.” There were no theatres on
the field at this time ; but he could get any amount
of sign-painting to do, for every little one-eyed store
wanted to buy, in big letters, 10,000 oz. of gold,
highest price given. About this time commenced the
roaring days on the Flat. Tipperary Gully broke
out, and the Chinese riots followed. And, thank
Heaven, we had no Miss-the-’Bus McGowen for a
leader, or the Chows would never have Received their
quietus! Tipperary and Chance Gully gave Lambing
Flat a £ooct start. Two theatres sprang.,up, the Em-
pire and Diggers, and one in Tipperary Gully. They
all boomed. Any amount of work offered in the
scenic artist’s line, and Thornton did gilt-edged
business. He was a very estimable man, respected
all round. There are but few of the old Lambing
Flat rioters left to regret him ; Time must soon call
the last of us to the final roll up.
“F.J.8.”: “Monkbarns” (B. 2/l/’l3) is altoge-
ther too positive. The identity of Faust is not his-
torically on ail fours with that of Balsamo or
Mesmer. The Socialist, Ernest Belfort Bax, has made
a very complete and exhaustive study of the ques-
tion (“Doctor Faustus and his Contemporaries”).
Bax examines all the evidence, and can find no genu-
inely historical Faust, the necromancer. He is in-
clined, therefore, to take him as a type, rather than
as an individual. He finds the material for his
making in two real persons, namely, Phillippus
Aureolus Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim or
Hoehener (“Paracelsus”) and Heinrich Cornelius
Agrippa von Nettesheim (“Agrippa”), whose doings
and claims were fused, and fastened on that Faust
who invented printing, and whom the monks hated
for discounting their value as copyists. “Monk-
barns,” by the way, makes a childish remark in say-
ing that Faust “managed to impress the public that
he was sold to Lucifer.” In that age of demonology
and witchcraft every man a little better educated
than his neighbors was, on the prima facie evidence
of superior knowledge, already a Devil-thrall. Luther
devoutly feared the Devil, and held daily arguments
with him, honoring him on one occasion by throwing
an inkpot at his head. The sneer at Cagliostro is
also beside the mark ; for, pretender though he was
in many things, he was undoubtedly a telepathist.
Franz Mesmer, who gave his name to mesmerism,
was no quack either, and it is stupid to associate his
name with that of Joseph Balsamo. By the way,
“Paracelsus,” from one of his names, gave Europe a
derivation for the terms “bombastic,” “bombastical”
and “bombast.”
“Hullo”: J.C.W., in an interview with S. M.
Heralsj, states, as usual, that he would only be too
glad to find a really good Australian play. And he
instances the really good Australian plays that the
firm has already produced: a melodrama adapted
from Wagner’s “Parsifal,” and two pantomimes! “1
had in mind two or three years ago to produce a
drama founded on Steele Rudd’s ‘On Our Selection,’
and I asked the author to try his hand at writing the
play, but. . . .it did not suit. I then suggested to an
able young friend of mine that he should collaborate
with Steele Rudd. . . .but he let a fine opportunity go
by.” It was the Firm that let that fine opportunity go
by—to be picked up by Bert Bailey. The Firm stands
accused of a lack of business acumen in not being able
to find on its staff, or off, the right Australian writer to
build from that excellent foundation the successful
and money-making play that “On Our Selection” now
is.
“Hullo”: J. C. Williamson has returned from his
quest of the paying play, and reports that “it is
difficult to secure plays.” And Sydney Telegraph
moans that the good play “has ceased, with a few
rare exceptions, to be produced in Great Britain.”
Apparently the only English dramatists that the
Telegraph has heard of are Pinero, Jones, Haddon
Chambers, Wilde and Shaw. There are, it 'may be
mentioned for the information of the Telegraph
and the Firm, others. Here are three plays that
have, from a box-office point of view, been strikingly
successful: “Hindle Wakes,” “Bunty Pulls the
Strings,” both by new authors, and Shaw’s “Fanny’s
First Play.” We might have these to begin with.
Then there is Bennett’s “What the Public Wants,”
which is exactly what the box-office wants. And if
the real thing is good enough for Australian audi-
ences (and judging from the success of “Mile-
stones,” it should succeed), there are Galsworthy’s
“Justice” and “Strife,” Elizabeth Baker’s “Chains,”
Barker’s “The Voysey Inheritance,” Synge’s “The
Playboy of the Western World” and —but these are
enough to go on with.
The Australian Kinematograpii Journal, a trade
paper which deals with the moving-picture business,
takes exception (30/l/’l3) to an extract from the
Sydney Daily Telegraph which The Bulletin
quoted recently. The gist of the quotation was (1)
that the head of Clement Mason, Ltd., had remarked
that a Picture Trust had been formed which would
mean to the organisers an additional income of
£250,000 a year ; (2) that the directors of a suburban
firm had said that, in that event, the price of films
would go up. The A. K. Journal appears to doubt
the truth of these statements. In any case it
denies that a monopoly is possible in the flicker
business. Listen to it: “How any arrangement can
be construed into a monopoly when anyone else
can undertake a precisely similar business is not
easily conceivable. There is nothing to prevent any-
one—provided he has a sufficiency of capital to stand
the racket —importing pictures and opening a film
exchange. This being the case, how can such an
arrangement, as has been entered into, be termed a
monopoly?” It is the argument of every apologist
for every trust on earth. There is, of course,
nothing to prevent anyone—provided he has enough
capital to stand the racket —from building theatres
and importing theatrical cos. with such vigor and
skill as to burst the existing theatrical combine.
The happening is, however, highly improbable. A
trust is not necessarily a concern which no one on
earth can possibly overthrow: it gets there just as
effectively, in most cases, if it is so situated that
the chances of successful opposition are reduced to
(sav) 1000 to 1.
“Star”: Von Biene, whose death the cable has just
reported, may not have taken his ’cello to bed with
him, but certainly it was never far from his downy
couch; and Auguste was liable to take it to his
breast at any hour of the night or morn, and rake
melancholy music out of it. At an hotel in one Vic.
provincial town three other residents burgled the
room, and pinched Von Biene’s ’cello from his bed-
side and hid it in the cellar, thinking to have at
least one night’s sleep. But Auguste discovered his
loss at two in the morning, and, getting out on the
stairs in a long nightshirt, howled like a dismal dog,
until the conspirators were glad to restore the fiddle
to its woolly and woeful owner. “Now,” said the
grateful Auguste, “I play ze kin’ shentlemen to
sleep.” And he played till daylight.
“Way Verley Penn”: Re Saharet’s divorce (B.
30/l/’l3). The “American husband” respondent, I.
S. Rose, who puts “Impresario” in caps, on his visit-
ing pasteboards, hit Australia by the G.M.S. Scharn-
horst on Saturday last. I. (which may mean Isaac
or Isidor) handed out to the Adelaide press-boys im-
mediately upon his arrival the story that he was the
discoverer of his late better-half the while she was
showing in vaudeville in ’Murka. He says he then
fairly pushed her into musical burlesque, in which she
made good by her toe work. Ike or Izzy also in-
ferred that he helped the lady in her recent divorce
proceedings, that he isn’t broken-hearted over the
loss, and that he supposes Saharet will shortly marry
again. Sfftraret, he says, got £750 for appearing in
her first cinemato. film (“In a Golden Cage”), and
a thousand for the second (“Behind the Mask”).
Ike (or Izzy) told me that his late missus acted for
the films quite against his approval, as he considers
her no actress—which view I endorse. Rose vouches
for it that Saharet was born in Ballarat (Vic.j.
that she left Australia at 13, and made her only
Australian stage anpearance in one of Williamson
and Musgrove’s ballets. As for himself, he has im-
presarioed mostlv freaks during his show lifetime,
and has landed with some more of them.
The Earl of Yarmouth, the skirt-dancer, is again in
the public eye—through the Bankruptcy Court. His
liabilities are set down at £20,000 and his assets at
£BOO. The Earl’s interest in his father’s'estate will
become void if he remains insolvent. The majority

THE PURSUER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I witnessed oft the big man’s flight,
And his pursuer’s weary plight.
The manager, with lowered head,
Ducked into darkness, and had fled;
The thin shape stole from out a crack,
And followed fast upon his track.
And when the jovial fellow sat,
With nice dark suit, and high silk hat
And took his drink with jovial cheer,
The thin and shabby one drew near ;
And then the former’s visage threw
Off ruddy joy, and faded blue.
From room to room within, without,
From street to street they dodge about
The stout man shows a troubled soul;
The thin one bears a paper roll.
One runs a theatre, they say ;
The other bloke has made a play !

Apropos sentences for “life.” During the
last 10 years six “lifers,” previously con-
demned to the gallows, have been discharged
from Victorian gaols. Only one underwent
less than 15 years ; he was the old Chinaman
who got his freedom after six years. Of
the others, one, a woman, convicted of wilful
murder, served 16 years. Three male mur-
derers served, respectively, 15 years and nine
months, 16 years and eight months, and 17
years. The sixth, a man, was convicted of
wounding with intent to murder, and served
18 years and seven months. There are now
in Victorian gaols 12 “lifers,” seven of whom
are being given the benefit of the “Carlisle
expectation of life” rule, under which the
Chinaman was released. According to pre-
sent designs, the others will remain in prison
for the term of their natural lives.
“Jersey” writes: —
lie the inability of Private Enterprise to supply
infants with more or less pure milk (B. 30/l/’l3),
I know something of the filthy habits of the average
farmer and his dairy assistants, and a truthful de-
scription of even the cleanest cocky’s methods of
milk production would cause a commotion in the
healthiest reader’s Stomach. 1 have seen obviously
diseased cows milked, and the fluid forwarded to
Sydney twice a day— and the owners of the beasts
knew that tubercular perms were being trucked.
Cancerous and tubercular cattle would soon be exter-
minated if the State would undertake to buy ttiem
all; but the cocky’s freed will not let him stand
the loss. So, unless an inspector happens on him
unawares, the poor emaciated beast is ' literally
milked to death. Every animal in a dairy herd
should be subjected to tubercular test. It is not
sufficient for an inspector to take a cursory glance
at a beast, as some cattle do not develop the usual
symptoms, even though they be rotten with disease.
Last week I saw a cow, scarcely able to stand in the
bails, be.ng milked, and its racking cough could
be heard half a mile down the paddock. A few
minutes later its milk was being put through the
separator, and later on was handed out to city eaters of
best factory butter. Ugh ! But the milking of diseased
cattle does not constitute the whole beastliness of the
dairy farmer. Watch the cows as they are driven
into the yard. Half of them are suffering from
sunburnt "teats. The filthy hands of the milker
grasp the sore and tender teats, and, with no at-
tempt at washing the udder with warm water, he
proceeds to squirt blood and milk into the bucket.
Private Enterprise then forwards the mixture to the
metropolis as pure country milk. Like thousands
of others who know, I don’t use milk, thanks. I
am waiting for the business to be run by some
authority whose main purpose in life will be to
supply pure milk, and not to make profits.
Some of the infants on whom Australia is
relying for its defence went out to La
Perouse (N.S.W.) last week for an encamp-
ment, and on the first Sunday a horde of
mammas, maiden aunts and elder sisters
descended upon the picnic and had hysterics
when they saw how poor Percy had to feed
himself, "if the food was coarse, the boots
were just terrible —great heavy boots, of
rough leather, with thick soles. Apparently
the female relation expected to find Percy
being fed on clotted cream, asparagus and
fresh oysters from Kurnell beach, with his
feet encased in patent leather shoon with
soles as thick as those of dancing pumps.
Probably the boys would not have known
they were “badly fed and shod” had the
female relation been kept at a distance. As
she was not, he now finds himself a dread-
fully misused youth who had to pay two-
pence per glass for soft drinks. These boys
were out to learn the hard business of war,
so as to be able when the time comes to
defend those maiden aunts ; and if the maiden
aunts imagine that the ice-cream cart will
meander up and down the firing line, and
that afternobn tea will be laid on, they are
making a ghastly mistake. The best thing
that can happen to Percy just now is to be
left alone with his instructor to be hardened
up and taught to take care of himself under
any and every circumstance whatever ;<and in
the long run that may be a lot better for the
maiden aunt, too. If Percy isn’t hardened
up, some very unpleasant things may yet
happen to the maiden aunt.
“Marloo” : The occasional fatal snake-
bite in Australia leads me to ask why the
much-abused Morrissey is so idiotically
ignored by persons in authority, such as
Boards of Health. During the first fort-
night of January four people were bitten at
Lismore (N.S.W.), and in every
case were cured with the Morrissey
antidote. It happened to be handy,
they applied it, and the job was
done. On the other hand, in the
same period, an eight-year-old child
died in Victoria from the poison of
a tiger-snake. If Morrissey had
happened to discover his antidote
while wearing a ton-hat and a flog-
ger coat, a whole Science Congress
would have advertised its virtue by this time.
The plain tale of a serious girl:—
The Bulletin of recent weeks has dealt with the
Red Plague. The churches have shirked the subject,
the State has shirked it, and parents do likewise —•
all shockingly ; the press, as a rule, the most shock-
ingly of all. As the subject doesn’t get discussed in
the ordinary course of events, the public will want a
lot of waking up to the dreadfulness of it. Com-
pulsory reporting of the disease is about the only
sane thing to be done; and when a license for
marriage is applied for, there should be an official
search of the registered list of those suffering from
the beastliness before the permit is issued. The
public, which won’t protect itself, won’t submit to
a medical examination as to fitness for marriage, it
says ; but it should be made to declare its unfitness.
I write strongly because of this unpleasant little
incident. A certain man was spoken of very freely
as my probable future husband. A nurse, a friend
of mine, hearing of this, wrote and asked me to
come and see her at the hosoital where she is em-
ployed. There, both she and the matron, ignoring
the precious professional etiquette which has al-
lowed more disease to spread than enough, told
me that the man in question was suffering from a
particularly nasty form of the disease. Later, I
taxed a relative of his, who had been urging the
marriage, with knowledge of this fact, and received
the Staggering reply that I ought to be ashamed of
myself for knowing anything at all about such a
thing at my age (I am 23). After I had protested
against this theory, I was told that no woman
should know anything about it at all until she was
married. I’m glad I wasn’t as ignorant as I should
have been.

Apropos that sigh or shout or wliate e it
may be, things must be pretty bad before
olr!he premises! 0 The 6 hist Commonwealth
figures (1930) show that, in that year, one
bride of -o years standing presented hei

a smaller space of time than is usually
allowed the bird after the wedding.
THE PROSPECTOR.
"Rooking for your overdraft , darling?" “ No , merely trying to trace the lost lode."
Northcote (Vic.) has become possessed
of a devil, and, like certain Biblical persons
similarly afflicted, it doesn’t know what to
do with it. The evil spirit in question is a
weapon for teasing flock, and has been in-
stalled bv an enterprising hat-maker. The
trouble about it is that it makes a noise,
described by a councillor as a “sort of weird
misery, calculated to drive a man to drink” ;
and as it creates this disturbance all day,
and can be heard nearly two miles distant,
it is rapidly getting itself disliked. The local
potentates have been asked to muzzle the
nuisance ; but they realise that it is a neces-
sity to any progressive hat-maker, and that
local industry is hampered enough already ;
so they have finally decided to order the
owner to build a high wall round the offence
so that its uproar may ascend to Heaven.
While this work is being done the public
might ask itself what its own responsibility
is in such matters. Everywhere there is a
growing disinclination to go more than a few
hundred yards to toil; wherefore the
harassed factory man who starts a new busi-
ness squeezes himself into a back lane so
that he may be no worse off, as far as labor
is concerned, than the rival factory boss
whose people have squatted down around
their work.
Badger, of the Brisbane Tramways, who
fled to his English directors after the strike,
probably to be out of earshot of Justice
Higgins’s compliments, got back last week.
He is an American by birth and training,
and hunted up Yankee notions while he was
away. The idea that hit him hardest was
the so-called “stepless” car —a vehicle sup-
plied with a sort of folding ladder, which
doubles itself up when the juggernaut is in
motion, and lets itself down when the thing
stops. Badger is getting one of them to
try on the dog. The advantage of it is that,
since the steps are down only' when the
vehicle is quiet, they can be carried to
within a few inches of the roadway. The
general use of the machine would probably
send the hot-hosiery store into bankruptcy.
Badger also prodded the “pay as you enter”
car; but it isn’t applicable to any but a
one-section line, so Badger wasn’t inter-
ested. It would have to be a short line that
the Brisbane Tramway Co. couldn’t cut into
two sections.
Large squads of seamen from the two
Japanese armored cruisers are let loose at
every Australian port the vessels touch, and
the press notices are always the same —“A re-
markably well-behaved body of men,” or
words to that effect.
Those little Japs
In peaked caps
Bear long and wicked knives;
The which they might
Employ in fight
To cut short human lives.
They march ashore,
But shed no gore ;
Polite ar,e they and grave.
And truly we
Are glad to see
How nicely they behave.
The tale of Australia's “first church”;—
On February 3, 1788, it being the first Sunday
after Phillip's landing at Sydney Cove, Chaplain
j c p, ar d Johnson conducted divine service under a bia
gum-tree, which stood on the site of the present flaip
in Macquarie-street. This year the Anglican
& contingent of be ii- t o PP ered aldermen, a bat
talion of choristers and a number of radiantly-attired
“‘“X ” vSSSnLe* the S
u 8 anniversary with the more hilarious rum-christened
< est j va i which commemorates Phillip’s official land-
ing How old Johnson’s ghost must have chuckled
at the celebration! He was described in a Govern-
ment despatch as belonging to those persons who
“call themselves dissenters.” He was made chaplain
to the settlement because nobody else was available,
and he did his duty according to his lights, without
any recorded fear, and certainly with precious little
favor from anybody. The Pioneers (whose descend-
ants are conspicuous on such anniversaries) were not
noted for marked manifestations of piety, and when
they were not wrangling with the Governor, and
doing their best to upset the administrative apple-
cart, they were selling rum. Poor old Johnson was a
misfit in a convict distillery. He pinched and
grubbed and saved, and built the first church, some-
where near the corner of Bligh and Hunter streets,
Sydney, out of his own pocket. It was a sorry
affair; but, like Touchstone’s Audrey, his own—a
proprietary church, built of wattle-and-dab. It cost
the poor chaplain a full hundred pounds sterling, and
then some ruffians burnt it down to escape compul-
sory attendance on Sundays. Poor old ghost of
Richard Johnson, penny-starved chaplain, what
amazement he must have experienced in contemplat-
ing the importance given to his first service on Feb-
ruary 3, 1788, before a lot of rum-soddened con-
victs, slowly suffering a recovery, and a number of
military and civil officers of the settlement who never
suffered anything else!

THE BAG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dustyville, the new suburb, is going ahead by leaps
and bounds. Every morning the incoming trains set
down crowds of city-bound business men, armed with
morning papers and the customary brown kit bag.
—Press whoop.
With shoulders bowed and knees that sag
I stumble in and out of town,
The slave and porter of a Bag
That I, perspiring, haul and drag.
That demon made of leather brown
Is mostly with sad rubbish packed.
(I blush while I admit the fact.) '
The books I cannot hope to read
I keep in there and carry far;
Some papers I will never need,
A sample of canary seed,
A section of an iron bar.
Life will be hard if I should gain
A length of rusty anchor chain.
Before I went and bought the Brute
With which I stagger to and fro,
With paper bags of fragrant fruit —
Frail sacks of squashy Dago loot—
Quite light and free I used to go.
I loathed the cheap and crackling fuss,
So went and bought the Incubus.
And now I totter, as I’ve said.
The maddest sort of galley slave
Who toiled and wished that he was dead
At least was forced to sweat for bread,
His hide from whistling thongs to save.
No such excuse have I, who sag
And sigh and totter with the Bag.
I often wonder if I’m sane,
With such a heavy load to trudge;
But half the travellers in my train
With similar Curses grunt and strain;
Each is a voluntary drudge.
I recognise with bitter mirth
The burthen-carriers of the earth.

Adelaide University has been opening its
mouth wide of late, saying that it is starved
for both land and money. A helping of the
latter has been supplied by a Government
grant of £12.000 for new buildings—all
promptly expended—and by an Act increas-
ing its annual subsidy of 5 p.c. on endow-
ments by a steady £4OOO more. Now an
anonymous donor has thrown in £lO,OOO to
start a residential college—which Adelaide
has never had—and other additions. But
there are two conditions : Government must
give an equal sum and a lot of land at th, :
hack, on the slope to the river. The Desti-
tute Asylum is certainly going to be moved
into the suburbs ; and the Agricultural Soci-
ety, the Military headquarters, and probably
the police barracks, will follow. The spaces
left vacant are likely to be the subject of a
scramble by University, School of Mines,
Public Library and Museum, it being Ade-
laide’s boast to have all these educational
buildings along North Terrace, in a row. with
frontage, of course, restricted. The Verran
Government was anxious to send the Univer-
sity out into the suburbs, too, but the idea
was howled down as undemocratic, an
immense proportion of the lectures and
Masses being attended by young people who
pee in city offices.

“A.E.P.”: He came from the North of
England, and was having a turn round Syd-
ney before looking for a job at Hunter’s Hill
of some other remote country place. “Pretty
dull iot,” he confided to me, talking on the
Mamy boat about Sydney girls. “How’s
that?” said I. “Well, when I’d stowed my
things away I went for a walk. Down
George-street I met a girl, and she said:
‘Hullo, Jabk!’ I said ‘Hullo!’ and pulled
up. She kept on calling me Jack. I took
her and gave her some refreshments, and then
we went to the picture show. Then I saw
her home — and she still thinks Pm Jack!”

One of the uninformed critics of Northern
Australia is the Rev. David J. Garland, at
present in Maoriland. Years back he was
in charge of a parish which included the
whole north-west portion of the continent,
and was at the time probably the only
gospel-agent in that great stretch of terri-
tory. Till Garland (travelling by himself
except for the company of a black boy)
blew along, herds of aborigines had never
seen a white man. But the reverend person
pins this yarn :
I was then impressed with the immense nossibili-
ties and the great fertility of the country. Except
on the coast, a wonderfully healthy climate, dry heat
in the day time and much of the year quite cold at

night. Well watered with springs and rivers, it is
anything but the uninhabitable and desert region
which so many people suppose;
For this and 'Other reasons Garland urges-
the hurried settlement of Northern Austra-
lia hy the British race —which is absurd, of
course, in view of the repeated warnings of
large, stout southern editors who have sat
at their desks and studied the matter for
whole evenings at a time.

W IFEY: “I didn’t, dear. I’ve got it on

“De Yid” : Of, S. Australia’s early big
estates the Da Gosta has had the best his-
tory. Bit by bit it has been cut up and
given away, frequently to the people who
had been tenants of the Trust; and when
two old ladies in England die, there will be
another division. This Da Costa was a
Hebrew who years and years ago poured
boiling oil on the Synagogue by giving a
considerable Dortion of Hindley-street to the
Anglican Church. Much
of the original estate thus
devised has been cut up,
but Jewish pawnbrokers
still pay a heavy rent to
the church for some of it.
The 20ft. frontage of the
Kalgoorlie Hotel, on the
corner of the once famous
or infamous Rosina-
street, still belongs to the
trusteees of St. Peter's
College. The rest of the
land occupied by the pub
is held on building lease
from an old brewery firm.
The land 'on which St.
Peter’s College stands
was left by Da Costa to
the two aforementioned
old ladies, but at their
death the college will
come into its own, so to
speak. Apropos Jew
gifts, one Solomon, father
of Vabien, famous for
being Premier in the
shortest-lived Ministry on
S. Aus. record, presented
a large block of land on
North Terrace to the
R.C.’s. This has a front-
age to three streets, and
a large convent and a
church are built thereon.
/One of Solomon’s three wives was an R.C. —
which accounts perhaps for his generosity.
At Mallacoota Inlet (Vic.) the other day
a person who had shuffled off from mortal
toil was. hurried ter the grave with musical
honors provided by a tourist’s phonograph.
“Abide With Me” and “Rock of Ages” were
the records used. If this sort of thing con-
tinues. death soon won’t be worth dying.
The problem of the indigent consumptive is
a dreadful one, but sometimes it is more
dreadful than usual. A Victorian mayor re-
cently made a public appeal on behalf of a
man “permanently incapacitated with tuber-
culosis.” The sufferer has a family of five
children —and the youngest is five months
old. Bad enough in all conscience, but still
a shade better than a case the writer recently
heard of. In a sleepy country town, a plucky
woman toils at a cottage washtub, rinsing
and wringing the clothes of healthy residents
and visitors. Close by, her husband lies
dying of the White Death. He has not got
long to live, but still hopes to see the expected
child. Even the careless, steady-nerved coun-
try people seem uneasy about it.
“Parisine”: It is not
often ttiat a Quixotic-
looking thing like the
Eiffel Tower proves to be
of enormous benefit. For
many years the Tower
was regarded as some-
thing of a practical joke,
of no use except that the
cheerful jesters said it
would be grand for recon-
noitring the Germans
next time they came to
Paris. Now Eiffel Tower
is the very nerve centre
of French “wireless.”
Under favorable circum-
stances, a message has
even been received there
from Canada. It places
the War Minister in un-
broken communication
with Belfort, Luneville,
Verdun, Besancon and
all fortresses on the
German and Italian fron-
tiers. Also, with the
naval stations of Toulon,
Brest. Cherbourg, etc.,
and the ships in the At-
-lan t i c and Mediter-
ranean, and even with
Algiers and the Sahara.
In case of war, there is
communication with the
mast above the London
Admiralty. However, it
i s doubtful whether i n
case of war “wireless”
will be of very much ser-
vice. Apart from the
fact that masts will cer-
tainly he shot away at the first opportun-
ity, there is the fact that the multiplicity of
wireless stations makes what is calked a
“jamb” very easy. When you want to pre-
vent a station talking to another station, all
you have to do is to send out your own radi-
ating currents and make a jangle of the
whole business.
The Rev. Edward Lyttleton. head-master
of Eton, has been urging compulsory mili-
tary training as an antidote to the idleness
and loafing of youths among both rich and
poor. Coming from the head of J. Bull’s
best-known public school, this must cause
acute pain to journals like the S. M.
Herald, which attempted to annihilate the
idea in Australia by remarking coldly that
it Was “un-English.”
“F.C.”: Observant travellers journeying
from Melbourne city to the Port may have
noticed, in a yard alongside the line, huge
heaps of old tins, and wondered what they
were for. They are a tribute to the protective
policy that encourages the German to use
his brains. Years ago the peculiar “rustle”
of silken garments used to be given to non-
silken dress materials by means of spun
glass ; then Hans discovered that chloride of
tin was equally satisfactory and less expen-
sive^—if he could get enough old tin. So the
agents of an Essen firm buy up all the old
tins they can get, at the rate of 6s. per ton,
provided the tin face isn’t rusted off the iron
sheet underneath. When enough have been
collected, they are tossed into hydraulic
presses, and shipped away as solid blocks to
the Fatherland, there to be smelted, treated
and afterwards returned to the Common-
wealth in some of the “creations” that adorn
the lawn on Cup day.
“Full Astern”: The most excited ship’s
crew that has sailed into Sydney harbor for
some time belonged to a foreign vessel which
arrived last week. Feeling its way carefully
through the heavy traffic of the congested
waterway, the ship anchored temporarily, off
Miller’s Point; but when it came to raising
the anchor again, the hook seemed to have in-
creased its weight a hundred fold. Slowly
and with a strain that nearly pulled the don-
key-engine out by the roots, the anchor ap-
peared over the bows, and then was seen
clinging to it what appeared to be the father
of all devil-fish. The crew promptly scat-
tered over the fo’c’sle head, some to escape,
others to find axes and circular saws and
dynamite to put up the fight of their lives
against the monster. Fortunately, the pilot
in charge took a hand in time to save the
under-sea cables linking the North Shore
with the city. After a strenuous time the ob-
stacle was cleared, and, curiously enough, no
damage seems to have been occasioned to the
tram system on the Shore or the telephone
and telegraph services. Probably the lifted
lines belonged to the telephone communica-
tion. which is so bad that if it were wrecked
in 171 places nobody would notice the
difference.
“Looking Backward” on the accusing
finger:—
lie finger prints, which are to figure in the Fitzrov
(Vic.) murder charge. It was Sir William Hershel
who first used the system in the detection of crime.
That was in the ’so’s or ’6o’s, when the Government
of India caught a number of Baboo forgers in its
toils. Galton perfected the system, and in his book
said that the chances of one print being identical
with another were 64,000,000 to one—a very hand
some starting price. But the use and classification
of finger marks goes much farther back. The present
system is based on a book written in 1823 by one
Purkenje, who was, I think, a Pole. His was
rather a scientific thesis than a system for identify-
ing cracksmen. The oldest known finger print in the
world is in the British Museum. It was found in
Suffolk, in a flint pit. on a pick made of the horn
of an elk. It was left by a palaeolithic person, and

nails were thicker than the modern manicurist al-
lows. Its age is estimated at 20,000,000 years or
so, Moses and other early historians notwithstanding.
It was probably later than this that the ancient
Egyptians—long before the Ptolemies and Cleopatras
- —made use of the individual character in finger
prints. In some of the mummy wrappings in the
British Museum napyri have been found with the
impression of finger tips on them. It apparently was
used as a signature, or an addition to a signature,
and was intended to block any Jim the Penman of
the day. The thumb was seemingly not used in
those times, but any of the fingers except the little
one.
Burns, Philp and Co.’s recently-issued
guide book, “Picturesque Travel,” offers
handy information of the interesting spots
of the world, and how to get there. The
Australian about to make a voyage, whether
for business or pleasure, will find the job
made easier at the start by perusing its
lucid pages.

In placing the old stamp on the envelope one tried
to be careful, out of respect to his Majesty, to put
the stamp on properly. Now it is a matter of no
moment how the stamp is put on. In fact, it looks
best broadside on.— Argus correspondent.
Whilst George's head adorned our stamp
(The head that wears the Crown)
We did not dare when it was damp
(By “it” is meant the postage stamp)
To stick it upside down.
With loyal care and courtly grace
We gummed it to the proper place
Where stamps should tightly cling ;
And then, for just a little space,
We gazed on George’s regal face,
And sang “Gorsave the King.”
But now we have a kangaroo
Instead of George’s conk ;
And little caring what we do
(It is an awful kangaroo)
We stick the stamp on cronk.
Turned upside down, or anyhow,
The animal, you must allow,
Is very like a whale.
There should be a proposal now
To change the ’roo into a cow,
Arid introduce a pail.
Ah ! if the blessed cow were there
Beside a milking shed,
Would any Tory farmer dare.
If his Anointed Cow were there,
To stand it on its head?
The stamp would then respected be ;
To lick its back on bended knee
He’d reverently bow ;
And having fixed it carefully
He’d sing “Gorsave Her Majesty”—
Her Majesty the Cow !

ALITIES
“Bill O’C.”: Always interesting is the
art of signalling, from that of the lighthouse keeper
to the methods of the mute, inglorious cobber “keep-
ing nit” for the coming of. John Dunn. A guard on
an Adelaide suburban line is developing a neat code
of his own. There are several small stations along
the line, at which the trains only stop on the requisi-
tion of passengers. The guard doesn’t bellow him-
self- hoarse to make his instructions to the distant
engine-driver, but manages it by silent work from
the other end of the platform. A golf links is
situated half-way down the line. If the train is
to stop there, he catches the driver’s eye and plays
a correct “approach” or “bunker” or something. On
another branch is the Port Racecourse. If that is
wanted, he rides an unseen “also-ran.” Near the
golf course is a siding sacred to a dairy farm. When
a stay there is demanded, he pulls a pint or so from
a supposititious Daisy. And if the train is to run
right through to the beach, he swims through a
breaker which isn’t there.
Coola ’: Sydney surfers have not so much
to complain of in the way of “bluebottles” on the
beaches as those who dip in N.S.W. North Coast
waters. One beach in particular, near Fingal light-
house, seems to be the congregating ground for the
beasts. Went in for a dip there one morning with a
mate, and we were stung worse than a pair of flats
at a church bazaar. We rubbed with wet sand to
get relief. Saw a couple of Binghis on the same
beach use the leaves of a small shrub. Don’t know
the name of the shrub; in truth, I know only that
the leaves were oval-shaped. Perhaps somebody else
knows the remedy. If so, the time is ripe for the
information.

Dear Bulletin, — The contribution of
“Niuafo’ou,” from Tonga (B. 26/12/’l2), wafted me
back in fancy to the palm-shaded, surf belted
dream islands of the South Pacific. It came some-
what as a shock that an imaginative female should
be branded as f. Baroness Munchausen for a few
slight addition and padding of facts solemnly told
her by one who, unfortunately, is now beyond refut-
ing or confirming his information. He is taking his
last, long rest in the Friendly Isles he so dearly loved
and so long labored for. The writer did not say the
lava statue of the woman, babe and pig was a work
of art. Possibly it would need a little sketching in
to make it recognisable. With regard to the malau
bird, I have a box of the eggs. Perhaps they are
rather large specimens; they certainly outrival the
product of the turkey, and that is somewhat of a
feat for a bird “nearly as big as a pigeon.” The
man from Niuafo’ou surely does not think that the
writer was so infantinely guileless as to believe that
the hen sat down and laid 100 eggs at a sitting.
It seemed hardly necessary to state that she laid one
a day for 100 days. The ordinary domestic fowl
often does that much, without being considered a
feathered prodigy.— One of the Glad Gihls on
the Mailboats;
A FAMILIAR TASTE.
In his report on the Trentham Cemetery, Mr. Evan stated that it required special irrigation. It
appeared to be an alluvial ledge, as the inhabitants sank into this drift for water, which was used for
domestic purposes. —News item.
THE WIDOW : “Every time I drink this water it reminds me of your pore dear father.”
“R.J.8.”: Re “K. O. Gill’s” curse on the
barb-wire fence. As far as cheapness is concerned,
the plain costs slightly less than the barb; but no
sane cocky considers that four plain wires make as
efficient a fence as four barbs. In fact, six plain
wires won’t keep stock out of a crop paddock unless
they have a barb on top. As for the alleged whole-
sale mutilation of stock —rabbits! Barb wire is not
dangerous if the wires are kept tightly strained. For
any mutilation there is, blame the fiend who lets
loose stuff lie around, and never strains his fences.
He’s the cove I’ve got it in for.
“Vagabond”: Can anyone recommend me
a cure for the cockroach curse on board ship ? I’m
getting crowded out of my bunk at night, and we all
have to stand guard over our tucker at grub time or
they’d snatch it off the plate. We’re edging along
into colder latitudes, and the only crumb of consola-
tion I’ve got is that some of the beasts may pre-
sently be frostbitten. We’ve tried all sorts of cures,
but none of ’em are worth mentioning. We have
various insect powders, which are blown through a
bellows into various cracks, but that’s no good. A
boot is the best remedy so far, but one can’t spend
all the watch below banging round with a boot. It’s
fatiguing, and the proportion of misses to hits is de-
pressing. Besides, “what is one among so many?” as
Shakspeare or Will Lawson says. So, if any Abo-
insecter can produce a cure, he’ll bring down the
blessings of a whole ship’s company on his head.
* * * *
“N. or M.”: “Leo Lear’s” starling (B.
9/1/’l3) is more swaggering than the one I am ac-
customed to down south, in the Apple Island. In
our district the starlings don’t think of interfering
with parrots and such. They wouldn’t dare. More-
over, the imported pest has, locally, dwindled of late
years—a thing to wonder at, as the countryside is
thick-set with harboring hedges. One of the theories
advanced is that the sparrows have fallen upon their
fellow-nuisances at nesting time, and turned them
and their bits of sticks out into the cold world; but
I won’t swear to this. I know, however, that the
starling is a variable beast. On Bruny Island, for in-
stance, the flocks of him that may be seen pervading
the atmosphere live on pickings from the beaches and
other unconsidered trifles, and are strictly honorable
as far as fruit is concerned. Incidentally, I note that
the Tasman minah —a little grey quaker of a bird
that lives on a staple of insects with a dessert of soft
fruit—has been acquiring unseemly habits of late. If
a skinned sheep is left hanging up for a few hours in
the open, the carcase will be found to be pecked all
over. The minah is a soft-billed bird, too.
“Bob Em”: The Marathon efforts men-
tioned by “Mimosa” and “Pick” (B. 9/l/’l3) are
nothing to perform about. Charlie Bates rode a
Come-by-Chance station horse (right off the grass)
from Come-by-Chance to within four miles of Wal-
gett and back, a distance of 65 miles, in five hours.
Also, one Arthur Colless, of the same section of
N. S. Wales, rode from , Brewarrina to Come-by-
Chance, with but one spell of an hour at Walgett,
in 15 hours —which works out at 140 miles in 14
hours. He used the one horse throughout, and his
riding weight was 14st.
THE DOUBTER.
BOSS COCKY : “ There's a couple of breaks up
'ere in this cockatoo fence. I want [?]eh to
go and fix it up straightaway .”
NEWCHUM : “Well, Til do it; but I don't see
as ’ow any fence 'll keep them birds back.”
“Mynza Bere”: Re the uarramundi of the
Wide Bay (Q.) streams. Was recently holidaying on
the upper reaches of the Mary River, where the
“barra” were like shoals of mullet. They have the
pleasant habit of every now and then rising to the
surface, and remaining there for about 20 seconds,
and I used to stroll along the bank and bang into
them with a gun. I saw, on several occasions, as
many as seven or eight, each a good sft. long, lying
so close that a shrimp couldn’t have crawled between
them. By way of a change they would swim along
in single file, each about a foot apart. One day we
cast covetous eyes on a big cove, lying in sft. of
water straight under our noses; but he refused to
budge till half a dozen fair-sized rocks had been
dropped on him. Then he came slowly to the top
to see what all the noise was about. He was im-
mediately honored with a royal salute of two guns,
and captured. On one memorable day I saw at least
40 or 50 of the big fellows in a space of 100 yards.
A man with a harpoon would have had more sport
than the tarpon fishers of Florida get. I can’t ex-
plain why they were so numerous and quiet, but the
drv weather at that time may have had something to
do with it.

“Mallarapoonie”: The giant yam of the
Northern Territory takes some beating when it comes
to depth of root. The vegetable is not unlike an
attenuated horse radish, and its leaf is somewhat
similar to that of an arum lily. It frequents sandy
flats and the margins of swamps, is a hardy dweller
in arid regions, and a staple commodity of food with
the wandering bands of blacks. In flavor and texture
it would pass for a very rank and fibrous parsnip.
Have followed it down with a pick and shovel for
6ft., and then given up in disgust. A feature of the
beast is its covering of thin slimy skin, like an
onion’s. The Binghis exercise amazing patience in
digging it out. With pointed sticks about 4ft. long
they grub down to surprising depths in pursuit of
it. Some of the big yam flats in the Territory have
supplied vegetables to a tribe for generations; and
the native yam-workings, with their mounds of earth
thrown up in all directions, resemble an old alluvial
gold diggings.

“Eddyson” : Barnby was seated in an old
tarred punt, with a prop in his hands. On the sub-
merged end of the prop he had tied three ordinary
meat hooks, and with these he was pottering about
at the bottom of the river. Bamby commenced
operations at daybreak, and it was now after eight.
His punt was almost waterlogged, and a scathing
sun was slanting blinding rays from the face of the
stream. But Barnby fished on. He was a man about
48, thin and brown, all hair and wrinkles. At half-
past eight Jonas came slouching down the east bank
in unlaced bluchers. Discovering Barnby he forgot
where he was going, or decided that whatever he was
going to do could be done just as well to-morrow, or
next week. After 20 minutes Jonas said: “Fishin’ ?”
Barnby grunted. Jonas remained standing,for an-
other quarter of an hour and then sat down. Barnby
continued his angling operations. At about 10 Tan-
ner came up from the bend, driving a black cow.
He forgot the cow on discovering Barnby, and stood
on the river’s brim, watching, open-mouthed, till 18
minutes past 10. Then he said to Barnby: “Fishin’?”
Barnby grunted. Ten minutes later Tanner said to
Jonas: “Fishin’ ?” Jonas waited fully a minute, and
then answered, “Fishin’.” Tanner sat on the bank
near Jonas. Barnby went on fishing. At a little
after 11 Tanner said: “Well, I mus’ be goin’.” At
half-past 11 Jonas said: “S’pose I’ll haveter be goin’.”
At 12 Tanner went. At half-past 12 Jonas said:
“I’ll be goin’ now.” Twenty-five minutes later Jonas
went. Barnby continued to probe the bottom of the
river with his hooked stick, but it was close upon
three in the afternoon before he recovered the body
of his wife, who had drowned herself at 11 o’clock
on the previous night.
THE SKITE OF LONG AGO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am an easy-going bloke, and have no axe to grind ;
I’m satisfied with -tucker, doss and beer ;
It takes a lot to get me riled ; so tolerant my mind,
With other blokes I never interfere.
But there’s a time when even saints get up to say a
piece,
When things above the limit overflow ;
And I arise and do affirm that we should cause to
cease
The irritating skites of long ago.
You meet them in the whare and you meet them in
the camp;
They sour the trip by coach and ship and train ;
They blow in on the bush track, and they give a man
the cramp
With that persistent cow of a refrain
That follows every mention of the things you saw, or
did,
Or dreamed, or thought, or absolutely know ;
“Aw, yairs; it’s not so rotten, but”—and then they
lift the lid
And empty out the skite of long ago.
Their liquor ran like water, yet they seldom turned a
hair
(Their cheques, of course, were cheques in those
glad days) ;
But when they did have jamborees (they had, at .least,
their share),
The trimmings, now, would fill us with amaze;
And all these blokes had rung the sheds, were saddle
kings at home,
The girls they loved were not too (blanky) slow ;
They beat the pug from Sydney-side where’er he
chanced to roam—
According to the skite of long ago.
They used to coach like blazes round the rim of
Devil’s Hill
(The leaders throwing handsprings as they flew) ;
But Hell Fire Jack, the driver, he was always cool
and still,
Excepting that he sometimes bent and drew
The team sharp round a corner with the sparking
brakes a-squeal
(A thousand feet the usual drop below),
With the (blanky) coach cavorting on a- single
(blanky) wheel —
They say so when they skite of long ago.
They kept a dark horse sometimes for the benefit of
mugs,
And entered it for races at the town
(Where the lambs are mostly tethered for coves to
bite their lugs
When they’re tired of One Tree Gully, and come
down).
And, of course, the (blanky) neddv always won the
(blanky) Cup,
And the One Tree mob collected all the dough ;
It was, you see, a monty with the One Tree jockey
up—
At least, it was by skite of long ago.
The way they used to bushwhack is an art long since
forgot
(Likewise the few remaining trees are small).
The bushies worked in couples and they made the
pace so hot
It’s lucky any timber’s left at all!
While one bloke whirled the (blanky) axe the other
soaked the butt
(To stop the tree from burning down, you know) ;
My oath, there used to be some blokes who did
know how to cut—
That is, they did in skite of long ago.
And it’s the same in everything from morning until
night—
There’s always some old geezer waiting by
To horn into the argument and loosen up his skite,
And jaw serenely on from lie to lie.
When all the sons of man arise to meet the Judgment
Day,
I hope that geezer's battened down Below,
Or else he’ll interrupt the show to have his (blanky)
.say,
And §fcite about the (blanky) long ago!

Change of water and food often cause colic and

Menz and Co., Adelaide (S.A.), is attacked with
either of these complaints he takes Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy. In a recent letter he
states: “Having suffered severely from colic, I have
much pleasure in informing you that Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy has on several occasions
given me instant relief, and I always carry it with

“A.L.8.”: “J.G.” (B. 16/1/T3) says that
Binghi isn’t in it with white men at robbing bees’
nests. But this is so only when Binghi tackles the job
in the white man’s way. It is questionable whether
one of us could work the trick as well as he when he
goes about in his own old fashion. A glance at
some of the trees he has burgled leaves the impression
that he possesses grit. It isn’t every person can
climb 80ft. per medium of toe-holds 3ft. apart, then
hang on with one hand, hew a fist-hole through into
the nest and calmly feast.

“Nym” : Re “Ginger’s” par(B. 19/12/T2).
All coastal tribes of the N.T. practise circumcision,
and so probably do most inland tribes. Many of the
tribes also practise sub-incision, keeping a few of
the best type of blackfellow to breed from, but gel-
ding all inferior males. Some N.T. blacks have a
practice that might be followed with advantage by
white folk in the bush. Waste matter of every
description—ordure, rags, bones, etc. —is carefully
collected, and either burned or buried. They believe
that the debbil-debbil will inhabit all rubbish, and
plague the original owners thereof. This custom is
also a relic of Israel, and lends color to the supposi-
tion that Binghi belongs to one of the lost tribes. A
peculiar fact governing circumcision may be noted.
In very rare cases are orphans circumcised, though no
reason is ever advanced for the omission. It seems
necessary for the father to be present at the cere-
mony, and 1 have known of several cases being post-
poned till that parent could be present. After the
ceremony, which is always performed at sunset,
and to the accompaniment of a peculiar corroboree,
the boy is held sacred for 12 mouths, during which
he must abstain from certain foods, and the wearing
of a naga (loincloth) is compulsory. After that
period is over he is entitled to a wife, though some
“blackfellers” remain bachelors all their lives, on the
ground that “ole feller lubra no more good; young
feller lubra too much silly-feller.” Another “Jewish”
rule of conduct is that when a blackfellow dies, leav-
ing a widow and young children, his brother or near-
est male relation marries her, and adds her to his
family. Marriage with a deceased husband’s brother
is not only necessary but often compulsory in the
N.T. This particular marriage is always settled by
the kings or elders of the tribes, though, within cer-
tain lines, the blacks are permitted to pick and
choose their wives freely.
A FEVER AN.
“ Well, Baggs, ole buck, wot erbout gointer
Wobbles's golden jubilee? ”
“ Wobbles's golden wot?"
“He slung up work go years ago to-morrow,
and he's celebrating."
“Nym”: A few years back, a par appeared
in The Bulletin alleging that blacks train dogs by
giving them a few hairs from the armpit. I didn’t
believe it. Recently, however, I handed a
particularly- vicious brute to a nigger in my
employ. The nigger tied the dog up to my
house and fed him, mixing a few hairs from his
armpit with the food. At the first meal the dog
nearly had a fit in endeavoring to bite the nigger.
It had calmed down considerably at the next meal,
and after the third the nigger untied the brute, which
followed him meekly. Narcotic?
“Chloe” : The aboriginal widow of the Nor’-
west makes a great demonstration at the graveside of
a dead husband, cutting and gashing herself about
the arms and breast. The wounds are only skin-
deep, however, but the
blood flows freely, while
the lady throws herself on
the ground, and refuses to
be comforted until the
chief stops up her mouth
with clay. This is called
making her “tadje,” and
the other gins thereupon
bind her hair with clay.
The rolls of chtyed-up hair
stand out like pipe stems
from the head. While
tadje, the widow may not
eat any flesh, even though
she may be immediately
given to a fresh husband ;
nor must she remove the
clay wads from her hair
till a certain time has
passed. Then the unfor-
tunate creature has to lie
in a pool till the sun-
baked ornaments are dis-
solved. Sometimes even a
week’s soaking makes
them as pliable as bricks,
and she is forced to saw
off the hair with bits of
glass. When her hair is
free, the tadje is removed ;
the merry widow is seized
upon by some of the
women, who hold her
down, while the chief rubs
her mouth with fat or
flesh. The victim screams
and protests that she is
unwilling to give up her
mourning, but, of course,
nobody believes her, es-
pecially when they see her chorus-girl appetite at
the feast which has been prepared by the s'sterhood.

“Mallarapoonie”: “Vigilans” (B. 2/1/T3)
is mostly right when he says. the Australian estuar-
ine crocodile (Crocodilvs porosus) is invariably an
arrant coward on land, but that is in the light of
day. The list of depredations committed on the
north coast of Australia by C.P. under cover of
darkness provides a long and dreadful roll of blood
and mutilation of man and beast. Eight years or
so ago, in Wyndham (W.A.), the record for that
settlement was three whites taken at different times,
the last a police trooper. The night being hot he
had probably laid down in the cool of the river
bank. Then there was the more daring ease of the
Malay who was taken out of a boat on the Victoria
River. Probably in this case, too, the man was
asleep. Next morning the boat was on the old spot,
in mid-channel, half-full of water, and the Malay
was gone. The manner of his going was never ques-
tioned. In almost exactly the same locality, un-
aware of this happening, my mate and I passed a
night in an open boat with crocs, swirling and
grunting all round us. We had two half-Myall
blacks aboard, and apparently they considered the
characters of the saurians particularly untrust-
worthy. I judged that from the fact that they took
turn about till daylight waiting with an axe for the
first croc, that offered the paw of welcome.

Dear Bulletin, — May I, from the safe
distance of Somerset (Eng.), be permitted to exchange
stoush with you on the recent par. (B. 5/9/’l2)
anent the vegetarian ? I wear neither hair (to my
sorrow) nor spectacles, yet for a long time now have
foresworn the ghoul-like habit of corpse-tearing. Nor
can I say that various revelations from time to time,
on the methods adopted by the gentle butcher, offer
me much inducement to return to the fleshpot. I
contend: —
(1) If man was meant to be carnivorous he would
have teeth resembling those of other carnivorous
animals, which he has not.
(2) That all nutriment is primarily derived from
the vegetable kingdom, and in taking flesh we only
get what the animal we eat has not used.
(3) That at the moment of death the animal has
many poisons in his carcase (in process of being
eliminated) which its devourer gets into his own
system, willy nilly.
(4) That the work of the world is done by non-
carnivorous animals —horse, donkey, camel, ox, etc.
(5) That flesh at the best is only a stimulant (bet-
ter than whisky, worse than beer) and is useless for
giving what we all most require—endurance. Wit-
ness the placid vegetarian horse trotting along in
front of a heavy cart, while behind him hoofs the
carnivorous dog, carrying nothing but its own fleas,
yet with protruding tongue, glassy eyes, and general
all-in appearance.
(6) That flesh-eating, more than anything else, is
responsible for cancer.
Finally, if anyone can tell me a more effectual
method of getting the better of the Yankee or any
other Beef Trust, then the drinks are on me.—Yours,
Aldridge Evelyn.
“8.J.”: “Native Born” (B. 16/1/T3)
asks for an abo. name for a home. There are
Toora, a house; Carinya, a happy, peaceful home;
Wahroonga, our home; Yaralla or Uralla, camp or
home; Elimatta, my home; Lumeah, here I rest;
Worm, hut; Langi, nest or home; Dandaraga, a
good place; Naygoondy, this is my camp. If the
humpy is in a valley a really euphonious name
would be Bukkuraepanyul, between the hills.
A TRICK OF THE
TRADE.
Hawker (loudly, on coining
away from place 1 where
he has sold nothing):
"God ’elp the pore woman
she hasn't got a shil-
lin in the 'ouse!”
“Snell”: “The greatest set-back I ever
had happened this trip,” said Azgen, the surveyor.
“Our camp was pitched by a creek at a place called
Pea Flats, and on the first Sunday morning I saun-
tered over to our nearest neighbor, whose name I
believed was Glass. Glass lived in a two-roomed
skillion stuck on in front of a chock-and-log hut. I
was rounding the corner of the hut when a sturdy
boy darted away from the front, followed hot-foot
by a long, lean, iron-framed female who reached an
arm like a spoon dredge, hooked the runaway,
tucked him over a knee and under an arm, and be-
gan to give him what-for with a large wooden but-
ter-pat. I forebore to interfere while the punish-
ment seemed within reason, but when it was pro-
longed to monotony I said: ‘Come, come, be reason-
able, madam. The boy has’ —I said no more, for
right there a red face covered with a scrub of brown
whisker pulled from the retaining arm, and a
coarse, grown-up voice said: ‘Look here, whoever-
you-are, if I don’t complain, what’s it gotter do
with you? Go on, Annie, if yer wanter.’ But Annie
did not go on. She set Glass, sen., on his feet and
retired to the house, grumbling about ‘interferences.’
I never made good with the Glasses after that.”
“G.T.” : The course of true love runs no
smoother in Papua than in more civilised spots.
Y’ama, of the Public Works Department, was build-
ing a beautifully exact wooden trellis for my veran-
dah. Little and old and ugly was Y’ama. His
short blue rami was innocent of conceit, and his dun-
colored top-gear unconscious of coquetry. Seem-
ingly, his whole soul was put into the sticks he was
working on. Ivikennys, passing along the road
below, gave an extra swing to their swirling grass
skirts, and called to him cheekily, but were un-
heeded. A man drifted into tea one day and shot a
glance of recognition at the old carpenter. “Well?”
I queried. And this was the yarn he told me. The
lady, an old sweetheart of Y’ama’s, had married an-
other man. Tiring of him, she sent word to Y’ama,
who lived three days’ walk to the west, to come and
kill him. He, taking with him a friend to assist,
obeyed. This took him to gaol for five years. He
was out scarcely one moon when another message
came requesting him to kill the man she had married
in the meanwhile. Again Y’ama obeyed. That time
both he and the lady became “belong Gubiment,”
Y’ama for seven years, the lady for life. His years
finished, he “signed on” to work in Port Moresby,
where the prison is. Every evening after his swim
he wraps him in a gay red rami and decks his hair
with frangipani flowers; then sits on the hillside
overhanging the gaol, and sings to his ladylove. (His
song is something like a dog’s howl, which makes
no matter.) His ladylove sits within and smiles.

“Te Babarantiko” writes about an old
sea game:—
For a joy-time hand me a harpoon and let me
stand on the martingale back stays of a fair-sized
windjammer, waiting a chance to let fly at one of the
50 or so “sea pigs” running about the forefoot and
ahead of the rushing ship. The thrill that runs down
one’s veins as the iron thuds home and the porpoise
foams out of the deeps of blue and goes swinging up
under the cat-head to the heave-ho of the watch on
deck! Porpoise flesh, though very dark and rich
in blood, is very good eating indeed, and when a
herd of sea pigs enter an Island lagoon great is the
anticipation and excitement of the natives. As a
rule, the porkers are easily approached in a small
boat, and I’ve more than once taken a canoe into the
middle of a herd. In a “drive” in the fairly shallow
water on the coast reef off Otua village, a native
dived off my canoe, clasped his arms around a por-
poise and swam him to the beach, where the fish was
killed. Formerly, porpoise teeth, with holes driven
through the roots and strung on fine coir twine, were
used in several groups in the Pacific as currency and
as ornaments for the body. In the Fiji and Solomon
Groups such strings commanded high prices, accord-
ing to the size and quality of the teeth. Now ordin-
ary silver coins are in use, and Brum, jewellery has
superseded most of the old native ornaments. Por-
poise molars have practically ceased to be of any
value in the Fiji Group, and will soon lose their
value in the Solomons. Vella Lavella, in that group,
is now the only considerable user of the ivories. But
even there the demand is waning, though the taste for
the meat remains.
THE BALLAD OF A TRUST BETRAYED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fat and fussy diner sat him down in doubt to
feed
In a hash-house that he’d never tried before;
The weary, worried waiter ambled up to know his
need,
And, smirking, slid the menu to the fore.
The old gent conned the items with consideration
keen,
Then moved his lips and marked his opening
course: —
“I think I’ll try a little lamb —I’d like it very lean —
It must be tender, too —with fresh mint sauce.
“And peas—ah, yes—some peas; some good, green
tender peas—-
e You’ll see they’re young and tender, will you not?
And don’t forget the lamb must be the knuckle cut —
and please
Be sure you see the gravy’s stemming hot!”;
m
The waiter murmured “Yessir,” in the old accus-
tomed way, 0
And slithered off as waiters e’er have d6ne;
He reached the kitchen counter, where he banged an
empty tray,
And bellowed briefly: “Bleat an’ bullets one!”

“High-flier” : McDonald, the aviator whose
death is reported in the cables (he died the
way aviators mostly do), was here with
Hammond, of the Bristol Co., a couple of
years back. He it was who flew that gallant
old warrior, General Maria Gordon, over the
city and harbor of Sydney. His untimely
passing recalls an incident illustrative of
England’s innate distaste for things that are
not imported. He was booked to fly at
Hendon on a monoplane—an
English machine. The Vicars-Maxim people
make a superb asro engine—the AA r olseley.
The continent of Europe can show nothing
better, yet the employers of McDonald per-
versely insisted on installing a French engine
for the occasion. In the end, the contrap-
tion never left the ground, the foreign engine
being defective in about 14 different direc-
tions. Had the ’plane flown under the cir-
cumstances, its pilot would probably not have
lived to die in 1913.
PUBLIC WORKS
MINISTER
JOHNSON (W.A.).
The cable tells that the corporation of
Bath (Eng.) the other day decorated with
wattle blossoms a bronze tablet affixed to the
house where Governor Phillip resided in that
village. Phillip retired there on a pension
of £5OO a year, and, having no other means,
put no frills on the Bath cottage. Tenants
of the old place maintain that the ad-
miral in cocked hat still haunts the premises,
and has been observed climbing through a
manhole on to the roof at midnight.
The retirement of Dr. Mercer, of Tas-
mania, and the rumored probable early re-
tirement of Dr. Clarke, of Melbourne, are
reminders that imported Anglican bishops are
not the stickers they used to be. Broughton
Happed his apron about Sydney for 17 years,
and Barker for 28; Nixon prayed among
Tasmanian apples for 21 years, and Bromby
tor 19 ; Short bore up with the piety of Ade-
laide for 34 years, Perry reigned 'in sinful
Melbourne for 29, and Tyrrell for longer
than Newcastle coalminers remember.
,J^ g ,ll can Bish °P Long* of Bathurst
(N.S.W.), and Father M. J. O’Reilly, the
V mcentian, who have been duelling before
the public over the hoary question
of Anglican continuity, are pretty tire-
some as controversialists, but both are
really good fellows when not out
for show. The Principal of the Bathurst
college is one of the raciest wits in Aus-
tralia, while Bishop Long, the handsome,
clean-shaven, erect bush naturalist and
enthusiastic surfer, is simply wasting his
time in chopping into little lengths the use-
less old brambles of doctrinal controversy.
“Motley” : A Melbourne paper notices the
demise, in the Old Colonists’ Home, of John
Birt, aged 83, professionally known as Frank
Weston, whereupon the paragrapher gives an
entertaining account of Frank Weston, of
Wizard Oil. Birt, who arrived in Melbourne
as early as 1854. was a performer with dogs
and monkeys. Frank Weston came first in
1866 or thereabouts. He brought the AVizard
Oil, and popularised it all over Australia by
means which fat Jack Bryan vainly tried to
emulate with his Styptic; AA 7 eston would
appear on the platform with his banjo, and
give rattling good songs. Then came “Now
I will speak a piece.” An Artemus AA r ard
lecture smoothly led on to the AA 7 izard Oil,
and he wound up by convincing everybody
that they must purchase a bottle. Frank
made so much money that he returned to
America and brought Weston and Hussey’s
Minstrels, including Frank Hussey and
Harry Kelly, who forestalled Billy Emerson.
THE COOKA BURRA.
The oldest living annual almanac in N. S.
Wales, and possibly in Australia, is
“Moore's.” It was started by “Jerry” Moore
in 1852. Jerry J. Moore was a cordwainer
by trade, who in the first ’4o’s commenced
dealing in second-hand books, at a stall
against the brick wall of St. Andrew’s old
cemetery in George-street. He mended shoes
while his customers waited, and gave them a
book to read to fill in time. Jerry used to
visit the immigrant ships as they arrived, and
bought for a song all the books the passen-
gers wanted to get rid of.
John Carr, probably the oldest legislator
in Australia, is on the brink of the grave.
Born in Yorkshire 94 years ago, he went to S.
Aus. at the age of 43, and two years later
was in Parliament. Not long afterwards
he was a Minister. He and the late Pre-
mier John Colton were “the Noarlunga
twins” —both were J.C.’s, both Wesleyans
and local preachers, both sat for Noarlunga.
they were together in several Cabinets, and
both were ardent social reformers. Carr
who was seen about the city until the last
week or two, has put in his spare time for
several years in writing letters to the papers.
“I was told off,” said the Victorian official,
“to show the Talbot Excellency over a new
irrigation work. I got into the State rail-
way carriage at Spencer-street. His Ex.
was to join at Toorak. When the train
stopped at Richmond, a workman of sorts,
apparently a bit drunk, recognised the car,
put his head in at the window, no doubt be-
lieving Talbot to be on board, and roared :
‘Get work !’ It struck me as a joke, and I
thought Talbot would see it that wav, so
told him about it. He just stared for a
minute, and then remarked, in a shocked
manner, ‘How rude !’ ”
That tireless black tracker of Australa-
sian historical records, Robert McNab, of
Maoriland, has another volume, dealing with
the colonisation of the North Island, almost
ready for publication. McNab has given
years of his life and bags of money to the
job of finding out things that very few people
are interested in. The average man would
sooner know a cert for the Hurdles than be
sure that Malaspina’s Spanish expedition
touched at M.L. in 1793, and the average
woman would rather hear that potatoes were
down a penny than that the original chart
made by Tasman’s pilot had been found by
McNab in Amsterdam. It is a thankless
job, in many ways, but the true enthusiast
doesn’t worry about thanks. All the same,
Maoriland might very well knock-off for five
minutes to ask McNab to have a drop of
something—especially as he would take milk
and sugar with it.
A London evening paper is responsible
for the information that the favorite tree
hereabouts is the wattle —“named after Mr.
Watt, the Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth.”
“ LOVES LABOR LOST.”
The State Government is favorably considering a
suggestion that the Sydney premises from which the
Governor-General was “evicted ” shall be used as a
State Government House. This has given pause to
some members of the party who proposed to fight the
eviction. —News item.
THE CHAMPION: “'Ere am I, trained to a
hair , and I dunno who to fight."
When in Adelaide the other day Denham,
Premier of Queensland, claimed to be a
South Australian because he lived for six
years (1881-7) at Mallala —the township
which also produced Works Minister Dick
Butler.
Justice Ferguson, who has been elected
unopposed to the late Justice O’Connor’s
seat in the Senate of Sydney University,
got his degree while working as a Hansard
reporter. His predecessor also earned his
first wages as a Sydney pressman.
Sturdy William Jamieson, the N.S.W.
Government suiweyor who threw down
chain and theodolite in 1884 to become the
first manager of Broken Hill, then a despised
I mountain, sustained the sorrow of his life
the other day—-his 21-year-old son, who was
so. suited to his father that he was more
friendly than paternal, died at Jamieson’s
Central Queensland station.
The Adelaide statue to C. C. Kingston is
taking shape at last. Chief Justice Way,
Langdon Bonython and Denny, M.L.A., are
looking after the fund in Adelaide, and Dr.
Cockburn has charge of things in London,
where Alfred Drury, A..R.A., is preparing
the bronze. The Adelaide Corporation has
promised a central site for it in Victoria
Square.

A few disjointed remarks from “Ancient” :
The death is cabled from London of Susan, wife of
Hamilton Osborne—about the last of the pioneer
brothers who founded the fortunes of this vast and
mostly affluent Australian family. Hamilton Osborne
aoes not resemble a pioneer. He more suggests an
intensely sporting London clubman. Some 10 years
ago a son fell over a low-railed balcony at the Aus-
trahan C!ub (Sydney) and was killed. Shortly after-
wards Bangaroo, the family place near Canowindra,
was cut up and sold, and this branch of the Osbornes
moved to England, and have there abided ever since.
,° , way \ a ra ther admirable feature of \ T S
Y ale f, <V° bl gges.t pastoral families—the Osbornes
and the Dangars—is the way they stick to the coun-
try where their money was made. Now that Captain
Clive Dangar has left the army, and settled definitely
°L tbe land ’ J 9 annot call to mind one member of
this family who is a permanent absentee, and if there
limit 3 dOZ6n absentee Osbornes that is about the
-Mrs. Binney, who died last week in Syd-
ney, was the mother of Dr. E. H. Binnev of
Macquane-street and Captain Hubert Bin-
ey, of the U.S.S. Co. Her husband, G
Nixon Binney, was the second son of one of
the most famous of all English Noncomform-
ist masters. The Rev. Thomas Binney is
still remembered as the greatest preacher of
.^ a U. and one of the most striking person-
alities in the Cold Country. Parker tells
A 3 Yu ? n , one occ asion. finding St. Paul's
Cathedral crowded, and only a few vacant
seats in the portion reserved for royafty
Binney calmly walked into the enclosure and
took his seat beside a visiting king No
court or ecclesiastical flunkey ventured to
stop him. On his looks he was the Englies?
man in London, and his immense stature and
strong, intellectual face do not seem to have
been belied by his character.
Apropos the late Dr. Brownless (R
30/1/T3), The Bulletin is told that his
wife was the daughter of J. II. White, the
N.S.W. sporting veteran, and his first 'wife
(formerly Jane Harbison Boyd, of Ballv-
mena, Ireland), and not of the second wife
( who had been Myra Kemble. The latter
lady left no children.
Henry William Northeroft
man with a somewhat picturesnue
record, was recently selected by
the Maoriland Government as Com
missioner for the Cook Islands i n ~
eluding that gem of the South
Pacific, Raratonga. By birth an
Englishman, he arrived in M.L as
a boy with his parents. Early, he
joined the colonial forces at Tara
naki and saw enough fighting with
brother Henare to satisfy most
men. But it was meat and medi-
cine to Northeroft, and in about
50 engagements, to say nothing 0 f
mere bickerings, he was wherever
he could most impress Henare with
the necessity of going quietly. il e
gained the M.L. Cross for con-
spicuous gallantry in rescuing
comrades, and rose to be a captain
of militia. In later years he took
to the law, and sat on the Bench of
the Stipendiary Magistrates’ Court in vari-
ous parts of the Loanly Islands.
Admiral Bedford, one time Governor of
Westralia, is dead, aged 75. His first active
service was in the Black Sea during the
Crimean War.
H. D. L. Woods, of N.S.W. Crcwn Law
Office, has been promoted to the job of Chief
Clerk of the Supreme Court. ‘‘Little Woods”
was one of the popular football idols in the
days when ’Varsity and Randwick competed
for the Rugby football championship. Woods
was the Uni. fullback, and has also repre-
sented the State in the same capacity.
The new Master of S. Aus. Supreme Court
is W. L. Stuart, 37, a son of the late Local
Court Judge and Insolvency Commissioner.
The new man has stood on pretty nearly
every step on the way up, and has been
acting-Master since Buchanan, so long the
holder of the post, became acting-judge
and president of the Industrial Arbitra-
tion Court. In his spare time, Stuart is a
major in the Defence forces.
“Te Babarantiko” recalls a kingly flogger:
The scientific and artistic flogger (B. 16/1 /T3)
calls up pleasant memories of King Te Bureimoa,
now basking in the
GOVERNOR
BOSANQUET, OF S.A.
sunny side of the
Throne of Grace. The
gentle monarch was
a staunch missionary
of the Boston Board
of Missions brand,
and had been told by
the missionaries
that, while smoking
was bad enough, the
drinking of “ sour
toddy” (fermented
palm sap) was a de-
finite step towards
Mone (Hell), and to
be firmly repressed.
T e Bureimoa r e-
pressed it on an old
piece of ordnance
mounted in front of
his two-storey house
in Butaritari town.
From a window h e
surveyed proceedings
in person. Te Kaie,
his Nosey Bob —an
imposing mahogany
streak of 6ft.-odd —
used a cat o’ nine
tails made of stiff
white cotton fishline,
with bits of lead
plaited in at regular
intervals, the whole
soaked before use.
The one with the
festive spirit was
made to crouch in
undignified posture
over the old cannon,
while Te Kaie oper-
ated. Ladies were
permitted t o take
their allowance
through a thin cot-
ton-print loin-cloth*
but the men were rn
the buff. One of the
last to be operated
upon showed me the
healing scars, and
shuddersome things'
they were. By the
Resident’s order all
floggings were subse-
quently forbidden,
but as late as the
end of 1911 there
w a s a reversion t o
the disagree able
. _ method on Banaba
(Ocean Island), jugging the nigger having had no
effect.
Marie d’Este, wife of the new Regent of
Bavaria, ought, according to a lot of people,
to be Queen of England. Charles I. is among
her ancestors, and she may or may not be
ashamed of the fact. Anyhow. George seems
to have a pretty firm seat on his gilded chair,
and even if the job were vacant a Stuart
need hardly apply. But it must comfort Marie
a lot to know that there is an organisation
in Maoriland formed with the special object
of upholding her claims.
DARE TO BE A WOWSER!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Don’t be disheartened if worldlings call you
“Wowser.” Fight on ! —Encouraging battle shriek.
Dare to be a Wowser and shame the scoffing world !
Fight the sooty Devil with a stout gamp bravely
furled !
Pray him down, and sing him down, and vent your
rage and spite,
For he’s nothing but the Devil, and it serves the
Devil right!
Dare to be a Wowser and make your wowsing felt!
Kick the Devil from behind, and punch below the
belt!
Put the boot into the Fiend, and let him plainly see
You are not hampered by the rule of any referee!
Dare to be a Wowser, and gouge and kick and
throttle!
Use your head, and elbows, too, and smash him with
a bottle !
Try a toe-hold now and then, and trip him on the
level,
Then strangle him until he croaks, “I’m sorry I’m
the Devil!”
Dare to be a Wowser, and jamb your bonv knee
Into the Devil’s neck and pant, “You won’t play Hell
with me !”
But don’t make him a Wowser, when holiness you’ve
gleaned,
For he’s our only Devil and a necessary Fiend.

The profits are better; but the balance-sheet figures
don’t differ much from those of 12 months ago.
We might as well get to them at once:—

There is not an unexpected movement among the lot.
Deposits have naturally shrunk a trifle. The Com-
mercial of Sydney does most of its business in
N. S. Wales, where its figures (deposits, for in-
stance) are greater than those of any other bank.
Its only Australian branches outside that State are
in Queensland. And both N. S. Wales and Queens-
land have been living in a furious riot of extrava-
gance. Australia’s imports of merchandise last year
amounted to £76,412,308. To pay for that lot
and the vast interest bill on old borrowings, it
exported merchandise valued at £66,391,293. The
foreigner didn’t give us the balance. We have to
pay for it with the gold we had accumulated or are
digging up (and there is very little of the latter),
or we must give our lOU. The banks have thus
been steadily drawn upon, and it is surprising that
the Commercial of Sydney doesn’t show a reduction
of more than £359,161 in deposits. It was also
inevitable that, though deposits and other resources
would shrink, more assistance would be called for
by many clients —in connection with uncompleted
land-purchases, and buildings and business exten-
sions, etc.
Fortunately this bank is able to meet such a de-
mand. For many years past it has held over 50 p.c.
■of its liabilities liquid, and even now it has over
49 p.c.—an extraordinarily strong position, and at-
tractive alike to borrowers and lenders. This policy
as without a doubt largely responsible for the ex-
traordinary growth of the bank’s figures. Look at
it for a 10-year period :

The paid capital is now £1,739,553; when the
final instalment of the last lot of new capital is
paid in March, the total will be £1,750,000. Twelve
months ago it was £1,500,000. With capital coming
in at odd times during the past few years, it is
impossible to say exactly what the earnings have
been in proportion to the average amount of the
shareholders’ funds, that average amount not being
ascertainable. This, however, gets somewhere near
the facts of the case:—
June, 1908 £7 5 7 p.c. I Dec., 1910 £8 1 10 p.c.
Dec., 1908 6 18 7 „ | June, 1911 7 19 8 „

Dec., 1909 8 4 7 „ June, 1912 8 211 „
June, 1910 8 2 11 „ | Dec., 1912 7 18 4 „
The figures are not exceptionally high; in fact, they
are only moderate. But the quality of the assets
must be considered; what the £14,091,956 of ad-
vances are like one can’t tell, of course, by merely
looking at the imposing figures in the balance-sheet,
but the £10,772,116 of liquid assets tell their own
tale. They don’t produce much immediate profit,
however; but they add enormously to the strength of
the concern. They add, also, to its prestige, and if
a bank keeps its head, prestige means future profit.

For a bank as big as the A.B.C. the profit is small.
In searching for an explanation, the size of the
inscribed deposits, which are a sort of pref. capital,
has to be kept in mind. Add the interest on that
capital, and the profits for the half-year were
£60,092. Also there is the other fact that the dog
had earned a bad name, and it takes a good while to
get the public to believe that he is a converted dog,
even though you do bury him as Snap and resurrect
him as Fido. Still, time is working on the side of
the A. 8.0. So far as new business is concerned
its position is uncommonly good. A bank depositor,
for instance, wants to know above everything what
security a bank offers him. That security depends
on the size of the bank’s own capital and reserves.
The bigger the capital and reserves in proportion to
the borrowed money, the better the security, other
things being equal. A further point to be considered
by the depositor is the quality of the assets. Are
they good ? In other words, are the capital and
reserves, which guarantee the deposits, as big as they
pretend to be? Finally, he needs to know what
is the proportion of liquid assets to liabilities. For,
obviously, a bank might be quite sound, and yet be
thrown into most serious trouble through being
unable to meet a sudden demand (a mad demand, it
might be) for deposit money. Now, how does this
bank answers those tests? Consider, first, these
figures:—
1911. 1912.
Paid capital £1,193,048 £1,195,275
Inscribed denosits . . . . 1,730,198 1,711,448
All other debts . . . . 2,743,160 2,691,287
Liquid assets .. . . 1,203,623 1,328,416
Advances, etc. .. .. 4,109,223 3,915,748
Premises, etc. .. .. 369,783 375,393
As mentioned above, the inscribed deposits are to all
intents and purposes pref. capital. The entire capital
is, therefore, £2,906,723. AH other debts (deposits,
notes and bills) amount to £2,691,287. Every £1
of the public’s money is, therefore, protected by about
£1 2s. of fixed money. Excluding the inscribed de-
posits altogether, the liabilities amount to less than
£2 ss. for every £1 of capital and reserves. In
ordinary circumstances it is not thought out of the
way in Australia if a bank takes £7 of the public
money for every £1 of its own. In England the
figures run even higher. As to the other tests, the
bank has £1,328,416 liquid, and £3,915,748 in ad-
vances and other assets apart from premises. Its new
liabilities are £2,691,286. Thus, it could pay just
on 50 p.c. of its liabilities with its liquid assets ; and
its other assets are worth, according to the books,
three times as much as the balance of the liabilities
No depositor could want better than that. And the
cash position is so strong that the borrower ought to
feel fairly satisfied that if his securities are all right
he won’t be harassed to pay up at the most awkward
time—a very important consideration. There is no
visible reason why the bank shouldn’t push ahead.
To all appearances it has gone through the fire and
been thoroughly purified. Big dividends are certainly
out of the question for very many years to come. The
size of the capital stands in the way of anything of
that sort. But that very feature makes the A.B.C.
attractive—or ought to make it attractive—to the
client.

It has never been possible to take this co.’s pub-
lished figures seriously. It has shown a certain
amount of profit; but the amount it has made
and not shown can only be guessed at. Go
back seven years, to the end of 1905. At
that time the paid capital was £140,000.
it is now £324,389, or £184,389 more. Of this
amount £50,000 was transferred from reserves,
leaving £134,389 of the new capital actually sup-
plied by shareholders. Now, during those seven
years the following vessels have been added to the
fleet: —Kanimbla, Kubu, Kirawa, Kaikai, Kailoa,
Kirrule, Kiandra and Kosciusko, along with a few
horse punts and small ferries ; and four others have
either just left the stocks or are building. It is safe
to say that these boats have cost at least £150,000.
Yet, as shown above, only £134,389 of new capital
has been got in. Further, as at Dec., 1905, the
landed property was valued at £88,408. l.arge
purchases have been made around the Harbor, and
the item stands now at £131,092, an increase cf
£42,684. Cash balances, less liabilities, on Dec.
31, 1905, were £18,700. They are now £64,962.
Ihus in these two items alone-—landed property and
cash balances—there is a visible £88,946 more than
there was seven years ago. That leaves only
£45,443 of the new capital to account, for. Ap-
proximately £15,000 of that has gone into new
wharves, waiting rooms, machinery, stores, etc.
Therefore, except for about £30,000, the whole of
the money put into ferries during the past seven
years has been provided by the co.’s customers.
Those customers have not only provided the co. with
a dividend equal to about 14 p.c. on the actually
paid capital, but they have also supplied the co.
with the new fleet mentioned above. This is over
the odds, and a co. which demands a profit of this
nature for supplying a public necessity is just about
the worst enemy of Private Enterprise that could
be conceived. Now, on the pretext that Wages
Board awards have put up the running costs, the co.
sends up a kite to find out how the wind blows with
regard to an all-round increase of season fares. Two
years ago, when the McGowen Labor Government
was comparatively new to office, such a thing would
not have been thought of. Indeed, eager to show
the public that it was quite a fair concern, the co.
about that time reduced the rates. But the directors
are not afraid of the McGowen Government any
longer. After two vears’ experience they know that
it is on the side of the boomster. In addition to
throwing this bomb at the public, the directors
calmly announce a further increase of capital. A
Government which had any sense of its obligations
to the public would take the bull by the horns
promptly. The co. is in precisely the same position
as the Gas Cos. The goods the latter supply are
no more of a public necessity than the service the
Sydney Ferries, Ltd., supplies. The Gas Cos. have
been told by Act that future issues of capital must
not carry more than 7 p.c.; future issues of pref.
capital are limited to 5 p.c. The same provision
should be made in this case. And the investor who
it tempted to buy at extravagant prices can rest
assured that sooner or later something of this sort —
if not something more drastic—will happen.

Big changes have been taking place in connection with
N.S.W. gas cos. ; and as one result this table has had
to be recast. The Gas Bill was the earthquake. As
originally introduced, it proposed to allow gas cos. to
pay 4 p.c. as a standard div. on their capital. A co.
might have got from its shareholders more premiums
than capital; but premiums were not to count. Also
a co. might have providently curtailed its dividends
and thus increased its reserves ; but that wasn’t to
count either. Of course, the Bill didn’t go through like
that. As passed, it allowed the cos. six months in which
to capitalise their reserves, and on the total capital
thus arrived at they may pay 10 p.c. If thev reduce
the price of gas below 3s. 6d. per 1000 ft. they may
for every Id. reduction in price pay an extra \ p.c.
of dividend. The Australian Gaslight Co. was not
treated any too well in the new law. Others were
not limited as to the amount of reserves they might
capitalise ; this particular co. was told that it must
not capitalise more than £425,000. This, as Bruce
Smith would say when he wanted to cut things short
was an injurious differentiation, and it was an unfair
one. It would have been a proper thing to have pro-
vided for the appointment of a valuator to represent
the public interests in every case and prevent the
over-valuation of assets and the consequent inflation
of reserves and over-capitalisation of cos. ; but that
wasn’t done. Indeed, the whole business was utterly
discreditable; the men in charge of it seem not to
have known the most elementary things about it; and
they proposed such patently monstrous things that the
whole business was taken out of their hands, and,
except for a line here and there (mostly poor ones),
it was seized by people who were very little concerned
about safeguarding the public.
The capital was £849,996 in 141,666 shares of £6
each fully paid. The co. has now issued one new
share for every two old ones, making the capital
£1,274,994. The Act says that “the amount of pre-
mium capital and reserves which may be capitalised
by the Australian Gaslight Co. shall not exceed the
sum of £425,000.” No further division of bonus
shares can, therefore, take place, no matter what
the assets may be worth. And the chances are that
they are worth far more than they stand at in the
books. In other words, it is practically certain that
a large amount of undisclosed profit has in past years
been put into works, etc. However, this investment is
not wasted; it will at least make it easier for the co.
to pay the 10 p.c. div. on the new capital (= 15 p.c.
on the old capital) under any adverse trade conditions
that may come along. To entitle the co. to pay 11
p.c. it must reduce the price to 3s. 2d. And as it
will not hereafter drop undisclosed profits into works,
it is quite probable that that price will comte along
before very long. Any new capital that may be raised
can carry only 7 p.c. as a standard ; and the shares
representing such capital must be offered by public
auction or tender in lots of no more than £lOO worth.
The directors may fix a reserve price beforehand for
these new shares. If the public does not take them
they may be offered at the reserve price to existing
shareholders, consumers and employees as the direct-
ors think fit. If they don’t go then, they shall be put
up to auction or tender again. And, finally, any
remnant may be disposed of as the directors please.
The premium capital got for any such shares is to go
to a special purposes fund ; but this fund is never to
exceed 10 p.c. of the capital. This fund is really a
contingency reserve. The idea throughout is to pre-
vent the accumulation of reserves, visible or invisible,
in order, of course, that the consumer may get the
benefit of a reduced price of gas when the circum-
stances allow of it.

follows:

Of the profit made during the past half-year it will be
seen that rather more than one-third was put into new
works. Taking the full 12 months past, the follow-
ing shows what has been done with the profit:—
Dividend (111 p.c.) .. .. £98,580
Put into new works . . . . 59,212
Reconstructing works, written off,
etc. .. 35,693
Added to formal Reserve.. .. 8,183
Total profit for the year . . £201,668
The amount shown as spent on reconstructions, etc.,
is additional to the sums ordinarily spent on renewals,
replacements, etc. The latter are charged up with
working expenses. The sums spent on new works are
in direct relief of capital expenditure. As at Decem-
ber, 1904, the capital expenditure on works was
£2,149,842. The total now shown as charged to
capital account is £2,263,170. Thus, of all the ad-
ditions and extensions effected during the past eight
years, only £113,328 has been charged to capital;
the rest has been paid for out of profits, and not
shown in the balance-sheet. In the past four years
alone, £180,092 of profit has gone that way. So, be-
sides getting their dividend, shareholders have had
5i p.c. p.a. dropped into their assets. It is an amaz-
ingly fine performance—from the shareholders’ point
of view. From the consumers’ point of view the thing
is not quite so satisfactory.
Nor does it look as though the co. will be dis-
turbed in its field of clover. It is rather different
in that respect from the big Sydney co. In the lat-
ter’s Act there was no provision for public purchase.
The Melbourne co. arranged things better—4t pro-
vided a plan of purchase which practically compels
the public authority to either leave it alone or pay an
exorbitant price. The price stipulated for by the Act
is six times the total of the last three years’ profits ;
and, though there is always some doubt about the
meaning of “profits,” it doesn’t look as though the
co. could be got rid of for under £3,000,000. Of course,
Parliament might amend the Act and make the terms
less onerous ; but the money having been subscribed on
these specific terms, it is very doubtful whether any
Legislature would repudiate and alter the terms now.
The only other protection the public was offered by
the Act was through the limitation of dividends ; the
co. might pay 10 p.c. if it sold gas at 7s. per 1000 ft.
and i p.c. more for every l£d. reduction. The pre-
sent price (4s. 7d. per 1000) thus permits the co. to
pay 15$ p.c. p.a. Consequently, the real protection
given to the public by the Act isn’t worth speaking
about. Nor does the electric light and power enter-
prise of the City Council seem to give the co. any
trouble. That concern ought to be a strong competi-
tor ; but the council, instead of using it to secure
cheap light and power for the people, seems chiefly
eager that it should pay money into the municipal
funds, and thus relieve Property of some of its ordin-
ary rates.

This concern is getting the results which its long-
headed management deserves. There was a time
when the situation looked pretty hopeless. The Ash-
croft sulphide-treating process had been bought by an
English co. for the usual extravagant sum, and the
Central mine at Broken Hill was secured to furnish
an ore supply. The mine had been much over-valued
and when the process failed utterly, Ashcroft excused
himself and it on the. plea of that over-valuation,
'pe co. was thus left with a most expensive plant, fit
for little but the scrap heap, and a mine from which
no substantial profit could be made by any mode of
treatment known at the time. Then C. F. Courtney
was brought in as general manager, and he schemed
and planned, with the results shown above. Not, of
course, that he did everything. The mine helped, and
lately the markets have helped ; and the co. has had
a fine staff. To-day there is not a more perfectlj
equipped mine in Australia—probably not in the
world. Broken Hill sulphides are a pretty hard nut
to crack. Not so many years ago a co. 'thought it
was doing very well if it got out 70 p.c. of the lead
and 65 p.c. of the silver ; the zinc wasn’t anything
but a curse. Last year this co. recovered 92.9 p.c. of
the silver, 93.1 p.c. of the lead and 89.9 p.c. of the
zinc in concentrates ready for the furnaces. And
“whilst this extraction and classification is most satis-
factory, it is expected that in the future some further
improvements will be made, raising the grade of the
zinc concentrates, and increasing the quantity of lead
concentrates recovered from them.” The process is
practically continuous. The ore is fed into the lead
mill, and with the help of water a mechanical separa-
tion is made there, the bulk of the lead and silver
being got out. The “tailings” go on to the zinc
mill, where oil and acid and water get to work in
the flotation or froth process. This gets out the bulk
of the zinc and a little more silver and lead. The
product goes to the de-leading plant, for the separa-
tion of the silver and lead from the zinc. The silver-
lead concentrates join the concentrates from the lead
mill, and mostly go on to the lead furnaces at New-
castle ; the zinc concentrates still go to Europe. The
co. tried to produce metallic spelter at Newcastle
and succeeded ; but there is, unfortunately, more
money to be made by exporting the stuff, arid giving
the Belgians and Germans the work that Australians
should be doing.
The table shows that £63,870 was written off for
the year. This includes £33,870 written off for de-
preciation—say, 3£ p.c. all round, which doesn’t seem
enough—and £30,000 put to a contingency fund.
A few thousands more ought, perhaps, to be added to
the profits, because Profit and Loss has been charged
with £2958, which was payable as premium on the
debenture stock ( £59,161) redeemable on December
31, 1912. The co. had plenty of means to pay off the
debt. This shows how things have moved along:
1908. 1910. 1911. 1912.
Liabilities . . £279,373 £131,210 £119,082 £l9l 612

Deficit .. £20,386
Surplus .. £199,627 £236,430 £399,778
The cash and good-as-cash on June 30 amounted to
over £lOO,OOO. There should have been another
£150,000 by the end of the year.
The output of ore last year (to June 30) was
220,450 tons. At that rate of extraction there was
enough ore in reserve to last 11 years; and the devel-
opments at the bottom level (1200 ft.) have been so
favorable that the co. is prodding the earth another
100 ft. forthwith. There is an end ; but it is a long
way off. The course of the metal markets is of more
immediate consequence. This shows how the things
jump (prices are the averages for each year to June
30) :
Lead. Silver. Zinc,
ton. (fine) oz. ton.
1906 .. £l5 11 0 31.4 d. £26 13 4
1907 .. 19 2 1 33.7 d. 26 14 8

1911 .. 12 19 5 26.7 d. 23 10 7
1912 .. 15 11 3 28.0 d. 26 4 9
The metal contents of the concentrates were as fol-
lows: Lead, 32,616 tons; silver, 2,401,9520 z. ; spelter,
35,451 tons. On those figures one can work out ap-
proximately what difference a fall of Id. for silver
and £1 for lead and zinc would make in the profits.
Put it at £59,000, and you will probably not be out-
side the mark —you may be a bit inside it.
The causes which led up to the smash in
the J. D. Williams market are to get into the
courts—some of the causes, anyway. First, one of
the co.’s managers was arrested on a forgery charge
in connection with scrip. Then J. D. Williams, having
first been sacked from the office of managing direc-
tor, was arrested on a charge of harboring the
aforesaid manager. The action against Williams
was taken on information sworn by one of the
directors of the co. There are, or were, two factions
on the board. Williams bluntly accuses the other
faction of declaring at least one interim dividend
for the express purpose of boosting shares; and his
protest against the dividend is on record in the
minute book. It is a nasty allegation, and it will
have to be answered. The only reply so far is the
arrest of Williams on a charge which has no bearing
whatever on this point. Meantime it is to the
credit of pretty well the whole sharebroking frater-
nity of Sydney that they have consistently advised
their investing clients to stand off this stock.
Nearly all the boosting has been done from outside.

Ardlethan tinfield (N.S.W.), though un-
questionably rich at surface, has yet to prove itself at
depth, and speculators ought to carefully read Geolo-
gist Pittman’s report on the nature of the granite
formation in which the lodes occur. Take, as a
sample, the Homeward Bound mine. It reports that
No. 2 shaft is down 38ft. At that depth the lode
stuff is about sft. wide. The lode is split up and the
tin is very fine. The estimate is 15 p.c., which, of
course, is a splendid prospect. Probablv it means 15
p.c. of tin oxide, in which case, taking oxide at £lOO,
the assay is equivalent to £l5 per ton. The report,
however, doesn’t state that 15 p.c. tin oxide, is the
average across a lode sft. wide ; indeed, as the lode
is “split up,” the average may be less than 5 p.c.
The Carpathia has its shaft down 27ft. The sinking
is in disturbed country. The lode stuff, according to
Geologist Pittman, contains granite, mica, quartz and
felspar, with a sprinkling of tin oxide. Blocks of
ore, weighing about scwt., have been found, estimated
to assay 60 p.c. These lumps occur in patches. Four
distinct classes of ore have been obtained from the
open cut. So far, no solid lode with defined walls
has been disclosed, and they are still searching in the
open-cut for a rich spot to put down a shaft. The
mine is favorably situated with regard to transport to
the Wyalong battery, and the high-grade ore men-
tioned so frequently would give a handsome return if
large quantities were available. There are 60,000
paid shares and 60,000 contributing. The former
have been exchanged at 10s. and the latter at Bs.,
making a total of £54,000 for the lot. It doesn’t
take very much tin ore as rich as that exposed in the
Carpathia to give a profit of £54,000, with the
metal at its present price; but it is one thing to
make profit and another thing for the shareholders to
ffetit. Big credit balances, derived from surface
stuff, frequently disappear in the search for perma-
nent bodies and in providing plant to treat ore that
is never found.

It was announced some time ago that a return of 20
carats per 100 loads would be a fair thing, so
presumably the first run is satisfactory, allowing for
poor and valueless stones. The price per carat, in
the rough, has been moving up of late. Taking 20s.
as an average for the lot, the yield works out at 17s.
6d. per load, not counting the sweetening of tin
oxide in the wash. The leads are patchy, and require
a good deal of testing before their value can be
hazarded. The deposits at Copeton are alluvial.
The wash generally lies in granite, and is overlain
by basalt; erosion has left it in scattered hills and
ridges. Tunnelling has been the usual form of pros-
pecting, but as the wash often dips towards the centre
of the hills, the prospectors soon lose level. Not
having the capital to drive low-level tunnels in
barren country beneath the wash, they are then
compelled to have a shot elsewhere. The chances
are that a crowd with a bit of money may happen
on a few decent pickings. At the Streak of Luck
mine a shaft was sunk some years ago. After going
140 ft. it met gravel up to 9ft. in thickness, averaging
8 to 10 carats of diamonds per load, and about
151 b. of stream tin. Attention, however, is
now being turned more in the direction of dis-
covering the original matrix or source, and the
recent finds of diamond-bearing dolerite are said to
have been confirmed by reliable authorities.
Great Cobar, though it is apparently not
suffering from shortage of labor now, has another
threatened trouble. Drought hangs on to the dis-
trict, and the mine hasn’t water enough to last much
more than a month. And at this time of year it is
often a good deal more than a month between drinks
in the Far West.

Mount Drysdale and Eldorado (N.S.W.),
hand in hand, have once again presented their weari-
some supplication for more time to mature that long-
threatened, but never-ready, plan of mutual support.
After repeatedly granting suspension of labor condi-
tions, the warden began to think it was getting be-
yond the joke stage. The last suspension expired
in November ; but as the cos. haven’t shown any signs
of animation since then, they have been asked to
show reason why they should be allowed to exist and
worry the official mind any further.

The much messed-about Queen Bee, near
Cobar (N.S.W.), had a swag of forfeited shares sold
by auction a few days since at 3d. per share. A
little lot of 98 tons has lately been sent to the Great
Cobar smelter. This policy of carting ore to Cobar
for treatment is certainly better than trying to smelt
small quantities under difficulties.

Lloyd Copper Co., with a nominal capital
of £280,000 in £1 shares, has been listed in Syd-
ney. The subscribed capital is £235,000, in fully
paid-up £1 shares; reserve shares, 45,000. Previous
returns show the extraction from crude ore varied
from 2 p.c. to 2$ p.c. copper. Taking the latter
assay, it will require 40 tons of crude ore to run out
a ton of copper. With costs at from 255. to 30s. per
ton of ore, copper will cost from £5O to £6O to pro-
duce ; so Lloyd’s is up against a problem in economy.
Previously copper was produced for £56 per ton, and
with cheaper firewood this cost may be reduced some-
what —always assuming the average extraction is
maintained at 2£ p.c.

“Collins Street” : The Australian “guinea
pig” director is becoming more voracious. With
the aid of proxies sent to himself, he has been
raising his fees gradually, taking a little more now
and a little more next time at the half-yearly meet-
ings, which in the case of successful cos. are never
attended bv more than a handful of shareholders.
Mount Lyell led the way ; then the B. H. Proprietary
directors got their fees raised; the North Broken
Hill Co. and other smaller fry followed. The latest
coterie to raise board fees from £lOOO to £l5OO is
the Broken Hill South, and for the work the directors
do they would be well paid at £5OO a year divided
amongst them. For, after all, the manager and the
secretary are the people who really run the com-
panies’ affairs. The directors are merely the chaps
who sign the cheques.

Phillips River (W.A.) gold-copper shows,
with which Germany was to show Australia its
complete ignorance of smelting practice and metal-
lurgy, are evidently at their last gasp. Hopes were
prolonged by the Whim Well Copper Co.’s controllers,
who held out hopes a while back that they could
procure some necessary cash; but an appeal by
Phillips River debenture holders for tributing parties
evidently reflects the failure of that financial scheme.
In reality, the district is better suited for wheat
growing and sheep raising than for profitable mining
on anything like a big scale. #
Associated Northern continues a sparkling
attraction in the Westralian market, a run of high
values having culminated in the richest face seen in
W.A. for some years. The shoot at No. 4 level in the
company’s Ora Banda property shows 82s. for 30ft.,
2405. for 45ft., and 2305. for 20ft. Then the drills
broke into specimen ore worth three figures in
ounces per ton. The best feature of the shoot is the
continuance of values on rising from the drive. At
the first point opened on, 20ft. shows 90s. per tom
while 2605. is recorded for 21ft. in a rise 50ft. off
the first exploration work. Values have been de-
clared conservatively, and as £6OOO profit per month
was within easv reach before the present bonanza
was kliown of. the task of the millman should be
still easier now. Without latest developments a
profit of £lOO.OOO was claimed as being in sight.
The co. (in 350.000 shares) has also a lot of cash
in hand, and a property in Mexico, now held up on
account of revolutionary troubles From the Golden
Mile lease a small revenue is still secured with the
help of tributors. *

Sons of Gwalia’s new winding plant is on
the mine, and giving more confidence to the miners
who are exploring the lower levels. _ ,
alteration in mine prospects, which have not emerged
from their cloud. Also, questions are still asked and
unanswered as to the real reason of the split between
the managers and the superintendent who pulled the
mine out of the mud. #
Pavne’s Find (W.A.) shareholders have
been told bv the manager that, after careful sampling
their allegedly wonderful show has a visible value of
£BOOO. Consolation is offered in the managerial
faith that some rich patches may be got. A more
comforting message would have been some assurance
that the gold was likely to go down. Any balance on
the ore in sight will at least be useful in breaking
a most significant silence on this point.
* * * *
After manv months of tongue-wagging,
the mine workers of the Golden Mile have passed the
01, t w ith a loud thud, deciding by 2364
”? ’ 5 " votes to go to arbitration. The real facts are
that labor is so short on the Mile and elsewhere
underground, and is having so free a time, that the
foolishness of even talking strike dawned on all but
the most crimson-d.yed of the red-raggers. It is quite
likely that a mutual agreement may be come to be-
fore machinery of the court is set in motion.
Great Victoria, Southern Cross (W.A.),
is being pierced fore and aft and in every other direc-
tion to gauge values. Quantity calculated at about four
million tons is admitted, and if evidence of quality
bears out prospectors’ claims, the price asked will be
P ai s| by the Great Boulder, and a big mill will be in-
stalled. Expectations are restricted solely to the
oxidised zone. Below this is a conglomeration, men-
tioned by metallurgists with horror.
A look at Edna May (W.A.) showed (1)
that the reef is strong and free milling, and enters
the property on the eastern boundary, and (2) that
the main workings consist of a level "driven 240 ft. at
70ft., with two shafts, one vertical to 70ft., and the
other on the underlay to about 40ft. below that
depth On the 70ft. level values are officially esti-
mated to average between 35 and 45 dwt., while in
the underlay shaft they are stated to go as high as
•Hoz. A little water was struck just below 70ft.,
but the country remains soft in the bottom, and so
far there is no sign of refractory ore. Between the
eastern boundary and the underlay shaft the reef
trends approximately east and west, and is inter-
sected by two crosscourses, which, however, do not
appear to have disturbed the reef to any extent. West
of the same shaft, where the quartz is over 10ft.
wide, the reef assumes a boomerang shape, turning
approximately south; in the end of the level it
appears badly faulted and thrown. At this point, the
reef seems to have had its course further altered, and
the underlay looks as though it might also turn from
west to east. Moderate exploration is needed to de-
termine these matters. Where the fault occurs,
values are stated to be 25dwt. As the cap of the
reef has been exposed at only one point, ore re-
serves are hard to estimate, but they may be safely
put down at several thousand tons. Except for the
disturbance in the south end of the 70ft. level the
outlook is bright.
* * * *
The much reconstructed Gwalia Consoli-
dated, Wiluna (W.A.), has had another reincarnation,
a new co. having been formed with a capital of
£125,000, in half-crown shares, to give the mine an-
other run. The inspiration in this instance is not so
much the mine as a volatilisation treatment process,
by which it is hoped not only to secure extraction
from the excessively slimy arsenical Wiluna ore, but
also to win possible royalties by extending the pro-
cess to the Golden Mile and elsewhere.
“M.C.”: Gwalia Consolidated has a new
roasting and volatilising process, from which it is
expecting great things. Superintendent Ben Howe
invented the process. He roasts the ore with a small
quantity of salt at a temperature of 1000° centigrade.
The metallic vapors are led through chambers and
drenched with water, and the gold is finally recovered
by filter pressing. The trouble with a process of this
kind is to maintain a high enough temperature and
yet prevent the ore from sintering. Sintering pre-
vents metal passing off as fume, and it is proving of
great benefit to copper and lead smelters on that ac-
count. The Ben Howe process, however, aims at pro-
moting volatilisation, and its success depends mainly
on a careful regulation of very high temperatures.
Something is evidently very wrong with
Hampden (Q.). Or if it isn’t wrong yet, there is
danger in the distance. The impending trouble ap-
pears to be in connection with the supply of power
from the gas plant.
* * * *
Apparently the re-formed Mount Oxide
Co. is to have a capital of £475,000 in £1 shares,
cut up as follows: 200,000 to the old co. (share for
share) ; 275.000 to the English people in return for
£150,000 of cash. The least satisfactory feature of
the Oxide throughout has been the amount of
“paper” in the flotations ; and this latest reconstruc-
tion, though it supplies the necessary cash, does it
at a big cost in underwriting commission, bonus
shares, etc. Fortunately the mine is developing very
well, and it needs to in order to carry what it is
loaded with.

Major Charley and Captain Osborne have
a working option over Mount Warminster copper
mine, near Mount Rockhampton, and not far from
Great Fitzroy. Ned Trickett, the sculler of old, was
one of the original prospectors; but Trickett’s objec-
tive was silver. The quartz veins round about Mount
Warminster carry argentiferous galena. Trickett’s
shaft is probably there to this day, and so are the
old excavations in search of copper ore. Some of the
ore was left on the surface until the bags got rotten ;
the owner of the land prevented its removal until
payment had been made. He took no risk, and
lived many years to watch over his barren freehold.
* ♦ * *
“Platman” : There is a kick left in some
of the old Far Northern (Q.) goldfields yet. For the
first time for years a crushing is reported from the
Wandercloud, reopened by one Morton. It was only
seven tons, but it went 4oz. of gold, worth £4 per oz.,
to the ton. Another resurrect’on is the Minnie
Moxham, at Northcote, between Mareeba and Thorn-
borough. Five tons went soz. of gold, worth £3
17s. 6d. per oz. Northcote is the only absolutely
deserted goldfield I have seen; all the others have
had one or two fossickers whose faith, plus an odd
dwt. or so, enabled them to hang on. But there
wasn’t a soul in Northcote. The remnants of the
furniture of the pub were packed into a spare
room. They were all spare, as a matter of fact. The
trouble with Northcote is that the stone carries a
lot of antimony, and antimony and quicksilver don t
agree. Another Northern mine that deserves men-
tion is the Just in Time. It is chiefly remarkable
for its prospectus, in which promoters and vendors
ask for neither cash nor paid-up shares. All they
ask for is a bunch of contributings and the cost of
taking up the lease. The holder is Keating, of the
Tyrconnel, Hodgkinson, and he is backing his faith
in the show by announcing his intention to take up
1000 cons. North Queenslanders can’t believe he is
well.
* * * *
At Charters Towers the New Queen
Cross has been providing a mild gamble. If the
crushings maintain the excellent average of £7 14s.
4d. per ton got from the first lot, the Queen Cross
may figure again on the dividend list. Still, there
are 200,000 shares, the number having been doubled
during a wild boom some years ago. Past history is
glorious, and it is on record that 140,000 tons gave
£7 16s. per ton. But the Moonstone lease is another
bird altogether, and up to date only 100 ft. or so
along a shallow level has been proved. On the other
side of the shaft there are a few inches of nice look-
ing brown stone, but the reef is very variable^
* *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, has
just crushed 466 tons for £2500 (£5 11s. 7d. per
ton) The half-year closes in March, but no definite
information has leaked out about the long-expected
dividend, which, if it is Is., would cost £7500 The
first crushing this half-year was 402 tons for £2696,
which compares with £2500 for the last fortnightly
lot. Returns like that should give a good profit; but
the co. started the half-year with a debt of £4170,
and has had to spend money freely on mine develop-
ment. The work done has had a double objective—im-
proved ventilation and increased ore reserves—and as
a result No. 5 level (2600ft.j now shows a payable
reef for 170 ft., and in places there is sft. of stone.
Still, the stoping average isn’t anything like sft.,
or the tonnage crushed would have increased more
rapidly. The Deeps are anxious to make the Brilliant
Block shaft, next door, an upcast, so as to improve
the ventilation, and are willing to spend a large sum
of money with that end in view. That is another
reason for delaying the dividend.
Chairman Plant, of the Brilliant Block,
Charters Towers, gave shareholders an interesting ac-
count of the agreement entered into with its more
fortunate neighbor, the Brilliant Deeps. One of the
great difficulties on the Towers is the high rock tem-
perature, which at 2600 ft. sometimes reaches 120°
Fahr. The only remedy is a large volume of air.
B is with the object of securing this air that the
Brilliant Deeps are willing to pay 70s. per foot to-
wards the cost of sinking a shaft from the end of the
Brilliant Block’s crosscut at the 2000 ft. level. The
shaft will be 700 ft. deep, and will be sunk in the
granite at an angle of 45 degrees. The Brilliant
Deeps also undertake to drive some 400 ft. in a direct
line to the shaft from their boundary at the 2600 ft.
level, all of which work is being done to improve the
ventilation. How much reef they will develop for
the Brilliant Block depends on the course of the
formation, which is somewhat erratic, and has de-
viated more to the south than was expected.
A gentle shove is being given to Bendigo
by the twin scribes who push the pen in the Bee-
hive for the Melbourne dailies. They have picked
out an old stager in Carlisle as the dainty puss of
the moment. If what has been taken out of a mine
be a commendation, Carlisle is all right, for it has
punched out 350,0000 z. of precious metal; but its
div. return is a long way below those of such giants
as Garden Gully, Great Extended Hustlers, John-
son’s, and, for that matter, the Catherine Reef. Still,
it has its splashes of luck, which have put
£48,00,0 of profits into the pockets of the unco’
guid. To-day the flurry is over an east back at
1140 ft. Here good gold has begun to make, and
the rise from 1200 ft. reveals a system of spurs with
rich stuff. Thus there is a run of crushing ground
20ft. in width to be developed along the big slide.
In olden times Carlisle’s neighbors to the north got
real stingo above this slide; but the market must
wait on slow Bendigo ways to prove whether the
claim is to have the same slabs of luck. And that
is tantalising. Spurs and expectations combined
have doubled the price of scrip, and the co. has got
back to the dividend list.
* * * *
Poseidon Alluvial has got into the deep
gutter without being flooded. Officially it is told
that 2oz. prospects have been collected by an able
and energetic manager. But the plunger somehow
isn’t putting much on Poseidons. There is always
a wobbly sort of feeling that the 2oz. prospects may
be cut out by a band of clay, or swept away by a
gush of water. Still a 2oz. prospect gives a nice
lead to the deep ground, which up to that time had
produced much talk, but very little to go on to the
scale. Now with the water forked off the shallow
gutter and the deep ground ahead, the co. has the
chance to, prove that it owns a mine.
» * * #
Powlett'North, Wonthaggi (Vic.), is the
last remaining bit of the Powlett coal ground which
was held by speculators before the State elected to
squat down in the Basin. Peter Mcßride, then Min-
ister for Mines, grabbed half of the original block
for the Crown, and left the rest to Private Enter-
prise, giving the latter a chance to show whether it
could boot the State mine out. A trifle of £48,000
has been spent during the fight, and the State mine
is still top-dog. The first bad lead of the private
co. was to tunnel through. There was no excuse
for this. Now, with the water following up the
drives, the onlv hope is to sink a shaft. That means
another £5OOO. But even now the fatmen aren’t at
all sure they have struck a mine, so at the eleventh
hour they are borrowing a drill to find out where
they are. They ought to have done that at first.
* * * *
Manager Miller, of the doomed Long Tun-
nel (Vic.), is getting a good deal of sympathy. It
is a deadly job trying to keep life in a tottering,
gasping old mine. The trouble in Miller’s case was
all the worse because he had only a very small mining
population to draw on. When this one mine went,
the whole thing went. Naturally, therefore, a good
many men didn’t wait for the end. There was plenty
of work offering at big prices in other places, and
they cleared off to get it—and usuallv it was the
men who felt surest of getting a job elsewhere who
went. This naturally didn’t improve local condi-
tions or make it easier for the tottering old con-
cern to pull through.
* * * *
Mathinna (Tas.) is in the throes of a
gold discovery. Assays have run up to close on 60oz.
of gold per ton. The find was made on the Old Jubi-
lee, a mine worked some years ago. The main shaft
is 300 ft. deep, but the recent discoveries were made
at the surface and at the 60ft. level. _ Government
Geologist Twelvetrees thinks that the line of reef is
a continuation of the Golden Gate, and that the
crosscut at the 260 ft. level must have passed through
the reef without recognising it.
* * * *
“Waihi,” answering a correspondent who
asked which mine had the biggest lift-pump in the
Commonwealth, the Waihi or the Tasmania, says that
the Waihi has a 28in. Hathorn Davey, while the Tas-
mania has a 24in. machine of the same Cornish type.

“Vigilans” : Dr. W. G. Woolnough’s report
on the geology of the Northern Territory is a heart-
breaking account of chances thrown away. Says
Woolnough: “The richest shoots of ore at Pine Creek,
the Union and other auriferous fields have been
scooped out. The poorer but still valuable material
has been left without proper support, so that it would
be expensive, if not impossible, to. extract it. Some
of the excavations made by the Chinese had about as
much symmetry as a rabbit warren.... Nowhere are
the evils more apparent than around Pine Creek.
The reefs have been worked without the slightest
attempt at system.... Mount Diamond is another of
those depressing places where thousands of pounds
worth of mining machinery is standing idle, although
report states that when work ceased the ore values
were most promising. At Brock’s Creek there has been
considerable development, but, as in most parts, the
mining is confined to a few Chinamen. The Cosmo-
politan, Howley, is another depressing spot to visit.
It has been the scene of vigorous mining industry m
the past but is now almost completely deserted.
The Chinese have been the curse" of Northern Ter-
ritory mining. A Chinaman rarely does any dead
work • he just follows rich shoots and veins. Fields
such as Wandi, Driffield, Union, Pine Creek and
Brock’s Creek have been ruined by this pot-hole min-
ing. The reefs are now almost imlocatable, and you
must get right away from the old workings to do any
safe mining. And it is the same at Bynoe Harbor
and the West Arm tinfields. The system of tribute
in vogue in the Territory for over 30 years was also
vile. There was no supervision over the Mongols.
They were allowed to pig-root the country as they
liked And everyone exacted toll from John —-“com-
shaw!” it was called. If it were virgin country to-
day, what a boom there would be!
* * * *
“W.N.” : The Commonwealth’s Insurance
Act ought to have something to say about the rate
of interest charged to policyholders for the use of
their own money. As much as 8 p.c. is charged by
some offices on loans against the security of policies.
The rate chargeable for such loans, or in respect of
overdue premiums should be fixed by law at not
more than (say) 1 p.c. above the average rate of in-
terest earned by the investments of the office.
Last year was rather a lean one for min-
ing finance concerns, and the London, Australian and
General Exploration, Ltd., had its reverses like the
rest. Nevertheless, chairman Moreing cheered share-
holders up at the annual meeting. About the hither-
to unprofitable Burma mines he took a hopeful view,
while as regards the co.’s big interest in Lancefield
(W.A.), he said that there were 300,000 tons of
Bdwt. ore in sight ready for extraction. The problem
of treatment, he added, had been solved, and he was
convinced that profits would soon be earned. The
remarks would be much more comforting if they were
not so beastly familiar.
The Jupiter shaft, on the Rand, is now
5040 ft. deep, and is being followed by a number
of other shafts which are already below 4000 ft.
At 8000 ft. it is calculated that the temperature will
be 102.35 degrees, an extra one degree being added
for each 250 ft.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 3, 1913.
My Deai: Arini. —
The old tradition that made the outgoing
Excellency pass the incoming Cocked Hat on
mid-seas, or some other unsuitable place for
a confidential parley, is breaking down.
Governor Chelmsford is timed to meet Sir
Gerald Strickland in Melbourne, or there-
abouts, early in March. With the discreet
Victor Hood at his elbow, the newcomer
won’t need many wrinkles from his
predecessor. Lady Chelmsford, however,
can put Lady Edeline up to the Right Way
of giving large donations of Good Advice,
and the correct manner of suppressing com-
mittee ladies. A few mutineers in the National
Council have writhed under the autocratic
rule of Lady Chelmsford, and the peace-
makers often had as lively a time as the
Conference which tried to stroke Turkey the
right way.
Archbishop Wright and his black-eyed
lady are making a swift departure for Eng-
land. “Church business” is the spur that
goads his Gaiters to leave his Australian
flock for six months or so. We can only
pray fervently that handing round the cleri-
cal hat in John Bull’s already over-taxed
island isn’t part of the mission to London.
The everlasting Cadge abroad is a bad ad-
vertisement for our prosperous continent.
His Gaiters, looking very sleek and well-
groomed, made a stately entrance into a
leather-bag and trunk shop the other morn-
■ ing ; so I suppose his silk stockings and lawn
draperies were about to be packed for
the voyage. I wonder if a heavy-weight
Archbishop ever sits on the head of a cabin
trunk when it is too full for words, or does
he hire a mere verger to do it for him?
Henley-on-Lane-Cove was rather worried
by a squally wind on Saturday evening.
When the dusk first began to fall upon the
river, the lighting of the lanterns exhausted
large supplies of matches. Nothing, it
seemed, less than a whole factory would
have kept one set of bobbing lanterns aglow.
Then the wind calmed down, and glorified
gardens gleamed with swinging balls of
light beyond the Lane Cove bridge and
down to the water’s edge. Patches of re-
claimed river, turned into grassy lawns by
sods and manual labor, made bold outposts
of illuminated color. A dim red haze from
bush fires formed a handsome backcloth for
a charming stage picture.
The carnival got much of its decorative
effect from the small and saucy row-boats
that rolled along under much top-hamper of
dancing Chinese lanterns. Mr. E. Bennett’s
big house had a clever scheme of lights—
stowed away in deep balconies and tossing
amongst surprised birds in the garden. The
Pasquils’ lawn, stolen from the river by the
ingenuity of man. was aflame with crimson
fire-flies- —probably mere lanterns that flung
long lines of dancing light into the dark
water below. Captain Wright’s nest was a
grand fandango of red and orange. And
every little bungalow kept its candle-ends
up, and strewed the earth with matches to
help the demonstration.
J. C. Williamson, a little slimmer than he
used to be, strolled into his Sydney office the
other afternoon on his return from foreign
climes. Henry Bracy was waiting on the
doorstep, and a stray head or two peered
round an adjacent door. Otherwise there
was nothing to show that J.C.W., who hates
a fuss, had been more than an hour away
from his official den. He brings back his
usual careful habit of giving no important
information to the press in the most attrac-
tive interviews.
J. C. Williamson broke his journey at Cey-
lon, and was the guest for a week of the Gar-
ricks, a few miles out from Kandy. Mrs.
Garrick used to be Rose Musgrove. Her
husband is reputed to be one of the wealthiest
tea and rubber planters in Ceylon, and their
homestead is run on lavish lines. The front
name of David has been plunked on to the
three-and-a-half-months-old heir to all the
tea and rubber. It poured rain for the
seven days J.C.W. stayed with them, but the
big man declares the week to have been one
of the happiest holidays of his life.
A slim white wedding card has come this
way. It has a decorative D and H on its
demure outside. Silver letters in its interior
convey the compliments of Mr. and Mrs.
August Hermann. She was Lillian Delany.
daughter of the late John Delany, one of
Sydney’s most accomplished musicians. The
wedding occurred in Berlin on December 21.
The summer sale is the chief thrill of the
moment. There are sales and sales, of
course; but, in any case, the struggle to buy
something you don’t want, because its price
has been chopped across the middle with a
blue pencil, seems to be worth twopence
halfpenny as a recreation. Mountains of
white gowns are more or less given away,
says a shopping enthusiast, and the summer
sales are genuine price-reductions; hut you
must be waiting on the shop mat when the
doors open if you want to get near the bar-
gain of your dreams.
For some weeks vivid purple millinery has
surmounted the summer tan of the outdoor
girl’s warm-weather complexion. A vista
of the afternoon shopping area in Pitt-street
looks like a raging epidemic of purple fever
stamping about the congested pavements.
But the last state of the Hat is worse than
the first. Its purple crown is now top-
dressed with blazing scarlet bows, and the
combined glare goes to the head of the
passer-by like a whiff from Sheol.
Winthrop Hackett, of the West Aus-
tralian, dropped into Sydney the other day.
He has a unique record for a newspaper
man: he was elected to the Legislative Coun-
cil of his State at last elections, and has
thus sat continuously since that body was
created in 1890. He is an M.A. of Trinity,
Dublin, and was chosen as first Chancellor
when his State set up a University the other
day. Years and years ago the offer of a
knighthood came his way, and was declined.
Then he married, and—well, the offer wasn’t
declined when it was made again.
_ A. B. Triggs, the large sheepman, who has
his headquarters at Linton (Yass), reached
the 45th milestone this week, and various
men of wool and finance lunched him to cele-
brate it. Later on the same day a quite-
family party said “Many happy returns” at
the Pacific, Manly. A. B. Triggs was a
bank clerk at Yass when he made his first
sheep deal at the tail of a drought, backing
an opinion formed on a long study of wea-
ther facts. The first deal made good, and
now he specialises in weather. The most vital
of his many business departments is his
weather office, where Australian rainfalls
are collated month by month. His big
success has been built on this knowledge of
general rainfall and weather averages, good
selection of lieutenants and pluck. He has
grass and sheep in many places, and when
the grass goes off duty in one region he can
shift the sheep to another. And buyers
trust him, purchasing hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds’ worth of stock on the re-
ports of his own inspectors. He is a man
of many addresses —among them Wirch-
illeba, Tara, Moonagee, Merri Merrigal,
Yarrandala, Willieploma, Wee Jasper, Long-
plain, Currangorambla, Uabba, North Mer-
owie, North Whoey and Ballandry, If the
poor aboriginal did little else, it helped Mr.
Triggs to names for the properties which
are the outward and visible signs of his
phenomenal success.
The Rollestons’ departure occurs in a
week or two. Captain Rolleston has been
the naval man behind the gun at Garden
Island for about four years. He belongs to
the old school of British bluejacket, and is
suspected of shying at anything Australian
with the same fervor as sheep-farmer A. A.
Dangar and other mutton magnates.
Ladies excepted, of course, for Mrs. Rolles-
ton is Australian born.
Mrs. George O’Regan, who died the other
day in Forbes-street, Darlinghurst, where
she had lived for 55 years, was an interest-
ing link with old Sydney. A sister of the
late J. P. Garvan, who founded the Citizens’
Life Assurance Co., the late Mrs. O’Regan
remembered the Sydney Domain when the
blacks frequented it. Her stock of old-time
memories included the wreck of the Dun-
bar. Going down t<- the Gap with her hus-
band very early on the morning after the
wreck, she saw the sole survivor hauled up
over the cliffs. A woman of bright person-
ality and benevolent disposition, the late Mrs.
O’Regan, who was a native of Limerick,
had a wide circle pf friends in this town.
One of Sydney’s best-known business
men, James Stedman, sen., passed out in
Hobart last Saturday. Appendicitis was
the first cause. Mr. Stedman has left a
large reputation for good deeds in the cause
of charity. I don’t know how long he had
been in business in Sydney; the Oldest In-
habitant can scarcelv remember when the
Stedman signboard first went up. He had
spent all his years beside the Harbor—was
born in Parramatta, learned his business in
Sydney (his start was where the Strand
now is, in a confectioner’s shop in George-
street), and for many years past his home
had been in Manly.
A Bulletin reader drops in a line to
mirror the shining virtues of the Australian
girl. “A recent accident on 1 the Orient
Wharf, Circular Quay, showed 'the Sydney
girl at her best. A tramguard was render-
ing first-aid to a man who had just been in-
jured. —leg broken, I think. The girl, who
was in a motor near the wharf, jumped out
and ran up to offer her help and the use of
the car. Then she went aboard the Orient boat
and returned with the doctor.. A few min-
utes later she drove patient and doctor off
to Sydney Hospital. Incidentally, I got a
tip from the doctor. ‘Use old newspapers
rolled up for temporary splints,’ he said.”
Pianist Lawrence G. Smith sent a few lines
to a friend in this city to say he’s steering
his course for Australian waters. For three
or four months Lawrence G. has been camped
on Jack London’s ranch, somewhere beyond
the wilds of ’Frisco. At date of writing, he
was on a cruise in the Londons’ yacht.
Organising sec. Grace Burrows( of the
Girls’ Realm, has hurried back to town after
a holiday at Wagstaff Point. In this marine
resort the finny tribe are said to dodge the
elusive hook with some success, unless a
veteran fisherman is out for business. Miss
Burrows has been impounded by the Blue
Mountains’ Centenary Crossing Committee
as general organiser of the May celebrations.
Tenor Sid Macdonald took his voice off to
Melbourne the other day for a well-earned
rest.
F. Barron Morley, a Sydney pianist who
has been abroad for about 10 years, threatens
to revisit his native water-front in May. He
lives mostly in Munich, with occasional
digressions to Berlin and Vienna.
Barron Morley, by the way, now clings
to his front name, and is known in Munich
as Frederick B. Morley. He found the Bar-
ron rather top-heavy in Germany, where he
was mistaken for one of the cerulean blue
breed of barons of the hereditary species.
The recently-returned organist Lilian
Frost didn’t add any weight to her long,
willow-wand figure in the 12 months she
spent on the track of foreign music. She
brushed up her practice under the Parisian
organist Widor, and nearly worked her feet
off on British pedals. The luncheon-hour
organ recital is a feature of modern London
life. It doesn’t accompany the midday
prayer, but is usually on its own, a merely
secular help to the one o’clock bun. Miss
Frost has returned to her Sunday perch in
front of the Congregational organ in Pitt-
street.
A year or so ago a Sydney girl named Per-
driau made an unostentatious departure for
the other side. She took a pleasing voice to
the studio of the famous Albani, and sat
down to scales and similar solid diet for 12
months. She returned here in the Orvieto
as noiselessly as she departed. The fact that
Albani should be teaching for a crust is
another glaring example of the old proverb —
the want of money is the root of all trouble.
Albani must have made tons of cash in her
day, though her day was rather before the
glittering fortunes that pursue the modern
prima donna —on paper or in fact.
The youthful Leah Myers was married to
one Roschmidt, in Paddington, the other day.
He’s with a well-known business firm as a
buyer or something of the kind. There were
no frills, and the honeymooners slipped
quietly off to the western highlands after the
ceremony. Whether Leah will lift her tuneful
voice on the concert platform again, or
merely warble to her household gods, is not
mentioned for publication.
Violinist Cyril Monk remarks in joyful
italics that he has just prevailed on Miss
Petersen to accept an engagement ring. She’s
a bright Australian girl, and like Monk him-
self, _ an ex-pupil of Sydney’s wonderful old
music-master Kretschmann. As “Isabel
Varney” she has made her presence felt as a
composer of songs.
Miss Toohey, of the Wahroonga branch
of the clan, went off to Europe the other
day. _ Her chaperon is Mrs. Douglas Mac-
kenzie, the military lady of the massive
jaw.
The Gaby Glide, which Jessie Lonnen
leads to encores in “The Sunshine Girl,”
appears to be an American negro version of
the old Grecian bend —an affliction which
smote English society in the earlier days of
Queen Alexandra’s Princess of Walesdom.
There’s some 19th century legend of the
beauteous Alex, having sciatica or some-
thing that made her limp for a time. Of
course the Court went dead lame, too, and the
Grecian bend (wny Grecian, by the way?)
gave the caricaturist lots of joy. The young
man who started this Gaby freak-hop in
Noo Yark must have seen a larky negress
carry home his washing. Even a stage
nigger always lets himself go at the knees,
and keeps on bumping the air behind to give
the impression of a bustle on the move. The
Gaby Glide is nearly all bustle, and I expect
the local parson will go to see it in order
to say how often it ought to be smacked for
its frivolous deportment.
The. Montessori method of injecting arith-
metic into the infantile cranium hasn’t come
along too soon. At a big State school the
other morning a very young class was
wrestling with a new sum. The teacher
observed the smallest scholar vigorously
writing a pencilled note, a suspicious thing
in school hours. “Give me that note,” says
the lady pedagogue. The youngster hesi-
tated, then laid her small crime on the altar
of authority. It was a mixture of Faith
and Works, and contained this line, “Pleas,
God, help me do this som” !
The Sydney Grammar School Old Boys’
Union has issued a stack of cards for a
smoke concert on February 7. Some of the
old boys have been grown up for 30 years or
so, but they mean to give a frolicsome wel-
come to the new headmaster, H. N. Sloman.
He is not ancient enough to have had a vote
fo~ very long, being 28 years young. He took
to himself a wife just before leaving Eng-
land. The smoked music will waft him into
his new scholastic den in College-street.
Another good old superstition has re-
cently died hard in the vicinity of a batch
of bush-fires in the Campbelltown district.
A travelled Hayseed lady returned home
with a plucking of peacock’s feathers amongst
other trophies. A few local acquaintances
admired and accepted small samples of the
gorgeous fowl’s tail. Others rejected them
with uplifted hands as unlucky. Then
the fires came along and carelessly avoided
the property of the settlers who recklessly
gave house-room to peacocks’ plumage, while,
by an odd coincidence, everyone who had re-
fused the feathers of ill-omen was more or
less scorched by the fire-fiend.
Golf is keeping fairly quiet till the first
week in April, when the caddy will return
in full force to his pedestrian sprint as
A.D.C. to goffers. At Kensington links
there was some mild pursuit of the white
ball on Saturday afternoon, and two Petti-
coats beat two male goffers with some
slaughter. This new digression in mixed
foursomes has inspired the vanquished to
arrange a terrible revenge later on.
The Richard Arthurs (Mosman) have let
their roof-tree, and are going off to Manly
for a surfing campaign. Manly, by the way
is “the Village” where two-thirds of the
male population seem to be hatless, collar-
less and always accompanied by a towel
There never before was such a rush to the
place as there has been this season. At least
one ocean beach house has booked up every
room on the premises until far into April •
and there are probably many more in the
same bulging condition, in spite of fancy
tariffs for sea-front rooms.
The Cecil Darleys, who live mostly in
England, have once more packed up their
chattels for the Land of Freetrade and low
wages.
Re Britannia’s free-food tariff, Lord
Brassey has again plunged into ink. This
time it’s a revised edition of his original
sin, which was a Freetrade pamphlet pub-
lished in 1904. The present volume is
called “Sixty Years of Fiscal Policy.”
When Brassey was Governor of Victoria he
had a careless habit of falling off things,
but he contrives to keep an unsteady seat
on a quaking stack of Freetrade statistics.
Naturally, he bumps against a preferential
tariff between the grey old Mother and her
overseas daughters. If the wealthy old con-
tractor could only fall off the peerage for a
few months, and sample the business of
working-man in a British factory, he might
change his mind about the glory of the
open-door.
The Austral Club (London) is going to
be swallowed, with its own consent, by a
Dominions Club, with larger premises and a
keen hunger for overseas members. Lord
Strathcona will be president of the new
club’s council.
A living replica of the Venus de Milo has
been found among the 400 maidens in a
U.S. girls’ college. She is sft. Tin. in height,
has a chest measurement of 34in. and a
waist of 30in., and weighs 12st. Her tastes
tend to beefsteak (underdone, I presume),
cold water and fresh air. She keeps off tea,
coffee and candy. Details concerning the
number of American millionaires who will
lay their impaired digestions and motor-cars
at the lady’s substantial feet will probably
be head-lined in the U.S. press later on.
Another polite slap in the face to our
sex! An enterprising Italian Miss, named
Teresa Labriola, is a doctor of laws and
professor of philosophy in the University of
Rome. So far, however, and no farther
shall she go her legal way. The Supreme
Court of Rome has firmly remarked that
women do not possess the right to be advo-
cates. So Teresa is sitting back to get her
breath, and may be wondering whose ears
she has the legal right to box for scratching
her name off the rolls before she had time
to gum it on, so to speak.
Yours affectionately,
Vandorian.
“Captain Jack” Evans, who has been one
of the fighters in the Tasmanian general elec-
tions, was four years old when he came to
Tasmania with his father, who was also a
skipper. In 1870 a whole fleet of tea ships
were sent to China and Japan from Tas-
mania. G. M. Evans was in charge of the
clipper Helen, and he had his son J. W.
(Jack) with him. The Helen beat the
others, and its cargo w r as all over Tasmania
before the others blew in. When the little
Evans grew as big as he could, which was
never much, he became a skipper too, and in
that capacity witnessed a tragedy performed
in 15 minutes. He had command of the
Tasma in 1883, and on a run from Sydney
to Hobart was having a cup of coffee when
the Hippolite rock was reported. They
were right on it, though it was broad day-
light and the day was fine. There were six
souls and the skipper aboard. A boat was
lowered and the lot landed at an adjacent
bay. The little skipper was the last to go,
and before his eyes the Tasma went down —
with 40 bullocks, among other things. Evans
reached Hobart that trip on the anniversary
of his birthday. After a while he took to
’long-shore_ jobs and entered the Tasmanian
Assembly in 1896 for Kingsborough, a sea-
side Hobart constituency and he has Deen a
pretty brisk member ever since.
Crosbie Ward, humorist and politician of
early Canterbury (M.L.), had a few ideas
that might have helped the Shickery
Islands a lot if they had been allowed to
breed and multiply. Even to-day a political
party might do worse than pin one of his
old verses in its hat. It occurs in a parody
of Byron’s “Isles of Greece,” written in
1859: —
Trust not for money to the banks!
They make a charge of 10 per cent.
Your land, which owes no stranger thanks
Is money—more than can be spent.
Crosbie Ward kept the early settlement
alive by his contributions to Canterbury
Punch, and was a member of Fox’s Minis-
try, and afterwards of Domett’s. In 1856
he became part-owner of the Lyttelton
Times.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 3, ±913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The fresh atmosphere of Upper Macedon
was tainted by petrol fumes when all the
Most Expensive People who were not on the
elevated spot oiled furiously to the Fullers’
garden party. Here and there along the
route a low-hanging branch swashed des-
tructively at a wind-blown plume or light
scarf; but everyone managed to escape
serious damage. His Ex. sported his gay-
est air, and struggled through the handshak-
ing and small talk without anaesthetics, his
smiling lady merely lending him moral sup-
port. Auntie Phipps, Help Curwen and
Secretary Wilberforce fussed gracefully in
the _ vicinity. Norman Brookes, unaccom-
panied by his wife, chaperoned the British
tennis players.
The Japanese invasion continues. From
the two grey cruisers, lying snugly at Port
Melbourne Town Pier, throngs of small,
solemn, brown men stream ashore like
strings of inquisitive ants. They do not
wander aimlessly about the city like most
visiting men-of-warsmen, but penetrate to
all sorts of places that offer no apparent
attraction for mere gazers. One particularly
keen specimeh was detected peering at a
boiling-down establishment from behind a
barrel. They have inspected the sewerage
system, and taken copious notes about dust-
carts, and one was heard to ask a waitress
what she put on her face. The way of
Japan with its visitor is different. A Mel-
bourne girl remembers a dark time when
the descriptive letters from her fiancS in
Japan stopped short. Every day the young
man used to scribble some notes about the
places he had visited. After a little of this,
the Japanese postal authorities became in-
terested, and, without warning, quietly im-
pounded everything as he dropped it into the
post.
There was some astonishment when a
group of the neatly uniformed and deadly
serious caJets presented themselves to the
lift man in the Gas Co.’s building. “We
wish to see. over the premises, please,” they
remarked in a business-like way. The
startled official looked at them hard, but
eventually decided that it wouldn’t do any
harm to give the unconscious humorists a
rise. The cage swallowed the lot, and it
floated up like a departing spirit toward the
top floor and the quarters of the fashionable
Alexandra Club. I haven’t heard what hap-
pened when they arrived on the mat, but it
is quite likely they were received with tea-
cups and applause.
On mail day swarms of the brown cadets
impede the traffic in the vicinity of the
G.P.O. They wait patiently until any sort
of official emerges; then they pour letters
into his arms, smiling meanwhile in a kindly
Asiatic way as if to say, “A letter from my
unworthy self to my degraded grandmother.
Ennoble me by posting it in honorable right
box.”
The men of the Belgian training ship gave
a farewell party last week at the St. Kilda
Town Hall. It was to have been held on
the vessel; but some afternoon-tea visitors
had endured such a rough time on the pre-
vious day that considerate Commander Cor-
neille converted the Friday evening func-
tion into a shore revel. The Mayoral Hen-
nessys were late, but eventually arrived.
(The lady’s heron feather head-dress might
have been the cause of the delay.) When
they had been welcomed, the organ boomed
an overture to a musical programme, and
the' cadets sang their national anthem with
an accompaniment of more organ. (The
Hennessys by this time must have got over
any regrets they may have had about leav-
ing their own vast organ at home.) Alice
Heeley, of the Sheffield Choir, stepped into
Napoleon Boffard’s place and intoned “The
Lost . Chord,” the organ thundering and
growling in the background. Mrs. Jansen
sang a favorite song of the bird-like Blanche
Arral in a deep contralto, and three cadets
got. through an Ave Maria. Then somebody
noticed that the programme was weighing
heavily, and the boys chanted an Opera
House ditty in broken Australian. The
guests laughed until the big hall echoed and
the dead weight of the organ was forgotten.
There was a fluttering, hair-bowed army of
dappers present, and directly the cadets‘had
pt through their hosting duties, they slipped
into chairs near their most adored girls and
sentimentalised. At supper time, all the
bewildering corners of the rambling hall and
the adjoining gardens were filled with fare-
well murmurs, until the boys were rounded
un by their tutor, a grim, grey-haired man
who seems to speak French with an Ameri-
can twang.
Chief Justice Parker, of Westralia. is
being dined nightly by all the Right
People in turn. His eldest daughter and a
grandson called Patsy are with him, but not,
so to speak, at his learned heels. They are
rusticating in the country, while he sacri-
fices his digestion on the wooden altar of
hospitality.
On February 11, the day the Morea sails,
Melbourne will lose a fine batch of spinsters.
All save one are furnished with return
tickets. Auntie Phipps is the lone exception.
After a halt in India, she will journey on to
England. Miss Graham, with niece Edith
Haynes, is off to London by the same ship,
whilst two Power girls and Rita Kiddle will
get off when the gangway is let down at
Colombo.
Dr. Arthur Brebner, with whom London is
acquainted as a journalist and novelist (his
latest work or job is titled “Patches and
Pomander”), is visiting here with his wife.
The lady is a daughter of Dr. Steven, of the
A.M.P. Society. The scribbling doctor, by
the way, claims acquaintance with numerous
Royal foreigners, including Karageorgevitch,
the gentleman who put on the crown of his
butchered Servian cousin. Knowing Karaetc,
I guess, must be rather like knowing the
Kelly Gang.
Surgeon Douglas Shields, who departed
last week to take permanent charge of a
fashionable women’s hospital in London, had
three fine aids to help float his reputation.
They were (i) manner, (2) a vice-regal
patient, and (3) brains. Please note that
brains are placed third on a foolish
worldly valuation. Manner is always
the first thing looked for. It is generally
believed that Shields got his from Heaven.
The Dudley lady’s illness at sea gave the
little medico a chance to earn the needful
big advertisment. And he did not miss it.
Mrs. Shields, who once helped to heal the
sick, will be missed verv much by her circle.
She shunned what is called Society, pre-
ferring the quiet, sane life and a small circle
of real Mends.
Chinaman Chia’s little white bride is hav-
ing a sick honeymoon. Some severe throat
trouble precluded any thought of departure
from Australia, and now she is in hospital
until such time as she can get away to the
hills to convalesce. The poor girl is fret-
ting for her mother, so the trip to distant
China is “off” for the time being.
Grand-opera Quinlan, after many years of
wedded life, has just been presented with his
firstborn. Noel Thomas Quinlan is the
infant’s name, and he is an Australian by
birth. The cable to father announcing his
arrival crossed another from father joyfully
reporting a record success by the co. in
Dublin.
Helen Sousa, the tall, slight girl with the
black hair and the chalk-white face, who
was out here with popper, mommer and the
sparkling band, has discarded the melodi-
ously famous name, and become Mrs. Hamil-
ton Albert, of New York.
The Hodges, Maddens, Powers and Fisk-
ens gathered in force at Mrs. ]Fred Keats’s
send-off to Mrs. Hussey Chomlby. (By the
way, the Chomleys drop all the English
trimmings of their name on ordinary work-
ing occasions.) The tall Miss Baird, who
was to have travelled to London with the
departing lady, has given up the trip, in
order to stay at home and comfort her sister,
Mrs. Goode, whose husband died suddenly
at Warrnambool.
The Mornington Woinarski family have
scarcely had time to straighten up the house
and sweep up the confetti of the last wed-
ding ; and now another orange blossoming
is threatened. Nell Zichy-Woinarski is the
one who has brought it on them, and Dr.
Arthur Nankivell is her helpmate. The date
is Tuesday, February 11.
Dr. Arthur Nankivell practises at Cohuna,
whither he will bear away his bride. He
is a grandson of the late City Coroner
Youl, the quaint old identity whose
last acts on earth were to drink a parting
glass of fizz and nod good-bye to the relatives
seated around his armchair. Strange that
no artist has ever thought of painting a
pleasantly dramatic death-scene on Youl-
tide lines.
A marriage is impending between Stella
Robertson, daughter of the great Mac., of
confectionery fame, and young Bert Brewer,
who was her “sweetheart when a boy,” and
is a neighbor of the Robertsons at Fairfield.
“Bobby” Bruce and Miss Jackson have
decided against any elaborate setting for
their approaching marriage. A chorus of
low moans has gone up from girls who were
looking forward to the conventional fuss
and flurry. The .Jackson and Bruce families
are already allied by marriage; Dr. Jack-
son’s eldest daughter married one of the
Bruces two or three years ago.
There was a gay, good-looking gathering
at the Paris Cafe the other Wednesday
afternoon to celebrate the wedding of Phylli's
Miller and Upton Brown. Prior Kind'elan
had only tied the nuptial knot an hour pre-
viously, but the bride had quite recovered
from the ordeal ere the reception began. Her
dainty trainless gown was of palest pink
trimmed with Limerick lace. Sister Molly
and Eily Miller looked like two blushes in
white ninon over pink satin. Impertinently-
tilted black velvet Beefeater hats, with pink
ostrich feathers, went with the delicious
dresses. The third bridesmaid—kiddie Jean
Dunstan —frisked round in a mob cap. The
bride’s mother sported a white Brussels lace
dress over black and a feathered black hat.
“Rosna” writes from London:—
There was a wedding of much frill and circum-
stance at the Guards’ Chapel on December 21 when
Maude, daughter of the W. H. Turners, of Westralia
was joined to Sir John Swinnerton Dyer, of “the
Scots.” The regiment turned out for decorative pur-
poses, and the regimental band provided what were
alleged to be appropriate noises. There were 10
bridesmaidens —five small girls in maize-colored
ninon frocks, with autumn-tinted wreaths in their
hair; five large girls, in maize-colored charmeuse,
edged with fur, and brown velvet hats wreathed with
ostrich plumes. They all carried sheaves of bronze
chrysanthemums and autumn leaves. Lord Desmond
Fitzgerald upheld the bridegroom, and Admiral Paget
stood beside the bride —a cream-satin-and-Malines-
lace bride —to see fair play. The reception was held
at Claridge’s, and the great invited included half
a column of Peerage and another of Westralians,
including Forrests, Wittenooms, Leakes, Steeres,
(Bishop) Rileys, Irwins, and I don’t know who.
Pianist Una Bourne was gladdened on her
way to England by the news that Melba had
engaged her for two or three concerts, which
is practically a guarantee that Una will be
fairly in the swim during the next London
season. The cablegram met her at Colombo.
Mrs. Chinn, from Westralia, is at present
in Melbourne. She has been so distressed of
late by the unkind things said of hubby that
one of Melbourne’s cleverest oculists is en-
gaged trying to restore brightness to her
pretty eyes. The Chinns and the Justice
Hood family are connected by marriage,
Mrs. Hood having once been Miss Chinn.
Mr. Pleydell, a nephew of George
Edwardes, of London, has been making ex-
pensive fun for the panto girls. He is a tall
young man who isn’t nearly as serious as he
looks. He also wears a monocle —or a mon-
ocle wears him, I forget which. Before de-
parting from Melbourne, he gave a farewell
supper at the Savoy to the principal star
frivollers. The room was festooned with ivy
in honor of the only Schilling, while Violet
Loraine was remembered with violets —arti-
ficial only because the real blooms are out
of season. Captain Rutherford, a cheery
young man from Singapore, assisted at the
revel, and the panto, orchestra made music
after the theatre had shut up for the night.
It was about five o’clock in the morning
when the farewell ended.
By the way, talking of revels, a cheery
youth turned up the other night at a Col-
lins-street hostelry holding in his arms a
dead duck. On attempts being made to
separate him from the corpse he wept bit-
terly. In the best circles, it is rumored,
deceased poultry threatens to take the place
that has so long been held by lobsters in the
hearts of wandering inebriates.
Mrs. Oliphant Shaw’s frivol at Terang
came up to the guests’ high expectations,
despite the fact that a number of young
couples wore a subdued and reverent “We
are engaged!” expression. Broken Hill
Knox’s second son and his fiancee, Miss
McArthur, walked together, a good example
which was closely followed by Willie Mani-
fold and his Beatrice Grey-Smith. The
Manifold girl-cousin, who lately gave her
promise to a sailor, looked rather lonely and
envious all by herself, her mariner being
away. She was consoled, however, by the
thought that he is making his last trip.
Father considers that life on the ocean wave
is too uncertain for his son-in-law, so he is
to shortly turn him into a landsman with a
fine block of Manifold country and a com-
fortable house.
A rabble of invited folks straggled round
the Exhibition on Thursday afternoon, in
search of a tea and bunning given by Mrs.
Robert Harper, as president of the Kinder-
garten League. They finally discovered the
feast set out behind the kitchen, with a
hostess clad in black and white in waiting.
Mrs. T. aßeckett was a pleasing sight in
blue; and Miss Henderson, of the white
hair, looked out from under a becoming hat.
The Burstons and the Robert Garrans took
an active interest in the proceedings, which
included, besides buns and tannin, some in-
teresting games by the youngsters under the
guidance of Miss Luck. Dr. Edith Barrett
headed an approving group of medicine
women.
Last Saturday the Brighton yacht turn-
out started with a torrid north wind, which
induced the flock of feminine watchers to
venture forth in cool and fresh-looking mus-
lins and linens. But when they were all
enjoying _ themselves, the treacherous wind
did a quick-change act, swung round to the
west, and charged down at full gallop. It
staggered the racing boats, upset a dinghy
or so, and whistled coldly round the whited
spectators. Chilled and ruffled women pre-
sently began to desert in herds, and there
was a pathetic show of white legs and scud-
ding shoes. The Club people sheltered those
who could commandeer coats; but most of
the girls fled and left the yachts with wetted
sails butting like desperate marine goats
through the racing seas. Port Phillip seems
to specialise in these unpleasant transfor-
mations.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Foundation Day, the beastliest possible weather
and the A.R.C. Races all came simultaneously. The
distinguishing features of the weather were a tem-
perature of 110°, and a “brave nor’-easter,” as the mis-
guided Kingsley termed it, which hurled dust, pebbles,
bricks and boulders in all directions. In the inter-
vals of dodging wind-flung portions of the Victoria
Park Racecourse, the crowd watched Mr. O Smith’s
Summerfield win the Burnside Handicap. He paid
his backers £ll9 Bs. for £l. Immediately after
the race punters began kicking themselves for not
having taken the winner’s name and the day as an
“omen.” For all I know they are at the same
unprofitable practice still. The race paid three divi-
dends, Uanna and Eager making a dead-heat for
second place. If the number of starters had not
warranted the second dividend, Summerfield’s money
would have been about £l5O for £l. The totalisa-
tor returns for the day are setting racing men talking
of bigger prize money; £ 20,000-odd is a fair in-
vestment for one day’s sport. Mr. R. M Hawker
secured the Turretfield Stakes with Tabangai, and a
second in the Tramway Trial with Rallina.
Lady Bosanquet was there, in navy blue, with a
tussore-silk-clad daughter. White linen or muslin
and shady flopping 1 hats were almost a uniform

POLITICAL
POINTS
In proposing the toast of “The Guests” at
the luncheon to the officers of the Japanese
squadron, Labor-leader and Prime Minister
Fisher declared that “he always advocated
the interchange of people and ideas.” Natur-
ally the Admiral replied that such a wel-
come had made a “deep and lasting impres-
sion on our hearts and minds.” It was all
very pretty and Sunday-schooly. but how the
Jap tongue must have strained the muscles
of Asia’s placid cheek! Still, the beautiful
sham is conducted in the name of Empire
and the British flag, and some other matters
which bulk largely in the morning papers,
and there are people in Australia, as the
Asiatic knows, who mistake such things for
holy friendship. That, no doubt, is one of
the reasons why the Japanese training squad-
ron is so often sent to these waters.
BON VOYAGE!
Melbourne Harbor Trust, some months
ago, imported a dredge from Holland, because
the long-headed Commissioners reckoned it
was better for the country to send 2d. out of
it than to keep 3d. in it. The unwieldy craft
staggered out to Australia, and had such a
bad time that, at one part of the voyage, the
sidelights were rolled right under. One of
the unfortunate crew likened it at this stage
to a half-tide rock. However, unlike the
dredge Manchester, which tried to cross from
Maoriland and was lost with all hands, it
managed to wallow to its destination, and
was duly put to work by its proud owners.
But, unfortunately, the brilliant economists
had forgotten to also order mud barges; so
the precious importation is standing idle half
its time for lack of anything to empty its dirt
into. Perhaps the Commissioners could help
by eating a little; they’ve fairly earned it.
No wonder Works Minister Edgar (Vic.)
used strong language the other day about
the multiplication of tinpot shires, and
Bumble’s consequent wastefulness. In Ray-
wood 137 ratepayers elect nine councillors.
Every fifteenth person on the roll is a coun-
cillor. In eight other shires the proportion
of dignitaries ranges from l-17th to l-28th
of the entire hayseed crowd. You can hardly
chuck a turnip at the population without
hitting a councillor.
Wienliolt, M.L.A. for Fassifern (Q.), is
to oppose Andrew Fisher at the next Federal
election. Wienholt is a staunch old Tory
(otherwise “Liberal”) who owes much to his
family connections, his long purse and the
fact that he gives his whole Parliamentary
salary to a lucky hospital in his constitu-
ency—his own constituency, mark! His dis-
trict (Fassifern) is largely settled by Ger-
mans, many of whom vote for him in the
fond delusion that he hails from the Father-
land. The Wienholts arc, however, a family
of Welsh origin, the father having been a
railway contractor in Bananaland’s early
days.
The “front” of these municipal mendicants
is amazing. Last year the Victorian Govern-
ment granted £4OO for the erection of what
is known as Kirwin’s bridge, over the Goul-
burn. The other day the Goulburn and
Waranga shires went hat in hand to the
Minister for another £2OO towards the job.
Seeing that both shires are working on a
shilling rate, this second attempt at extor-
tion was turned down. The urban taxpayer
is dead tired of contributing to the support
of these cadging bodies. In Victoria there
are 72 shires which have persistently refused
to strike a rate higher than a shilling, _ and
most of them work on out-of-date valuations.
This year the Public Works Minister has
been allowed £40,000 for doles to municipal
mendicants, and up to now he has received
begging applications for £250,000.
“H.S.” on a matter of machinery:—
There is likely to be a row soon amongst some
N.S.W. Labor Leagues. On them has hitherto rested
the onus oi keeping the flag flying in the off season
and doing Labor’s work generally. In return for this,
as it were, they selected Parliamentary candidates,
and Labor voters have generally accepted their
choice. At the instance of the Typographical Asso-
ciation this has been altered by the conference just
concluded, and an affiliated union may now foist the
whole of its members resident in an electorate on the
local League by the short-cut method of paying 6d.
a head to the executive body, when they will imme-
diately become eligible to deal with League funds,
select candidates, and do any other odd jobs knocking
about. The possibilities for “packing” are glorious.
It may happen that McGowen, just before selection,
runs foul of (say) the wharf laborers, amongst whom
are many red-raggers. By a simple resolution of the
union, two or three hundred of them can be landed
into the Redfern League, and McGowen’s old guard
will be outvoted four to one. Good unionists are
usually in the Leagues already, and don’t wait to be
poured in. To be a member of a union means no-
thing to-day. Everyone is a “unionist” now. Mem-
bership is practically compulsory, has no significance
and carries no virtue ; but the conference apparently
thought otherwise. Some of the best “Liberals” this
writer has known were A.W.U. men, who did a little
shearing the while they were accumulating a few
sheep and making their C.P. holding freehold. Even
the typographicals, who sent along the proposal, have
had a “Liberal” president. It is claimed for the
departure that it works smoothly in Victoria. But
where are the results? Has anybody heard of a Vic.
Labor Government yet?
“Sine’s” view of the horse-doctor: —
Administrator Gi 1-
ruth has reported on
the Northern Terri-
tory, and, as was to
be expected, has taken
a vet.’s view of Aus-
tralia’s empty back-
yard. Not a word is
said about encouraging
mining or prospecting,
the only way Austra-
lia’s buffalo preserve
will be populated.
Here is a vast region
holding gold, copper,
silver, tin, wolfram,
oil, coal and rare
earths, which only
needs tracks, boring
rigs and water wells
to make it a good
mining district, and all
we can do with it is
to use it as an experi-
mental farm for rais-
ing weedy horses and
anaemic pigs. Nor does
the Administration
learn as it goes. Thus,
the mining ordinance
just formulated, regarding the mode of getting
leases to nrospect for oil, shows that neither the
Spring-street officers of the Department nor Dr. Gil-
ruth have the faintest idea how this industry should
be developed. The Territory will be a dead loss to
the country until a mining Administrator, who doesn’t
know anthrax from glanders or pig’s nmasles from
mule’s staggers, is appointed, and turns two shiploads
of Charters Towers men loose to go and look for
minerals. Mining alone will pioneer the settlement
of North Australia.
Though the eight-hour day is supposed to be
the general rule in its public services, Victoria
learnt the other morning that no less than
six suburban railway signal-boxes are worked
on the 10-hour system— i.e., 60 hours one
week, with Sunday off; the next 72 hours,
with a straight 12-hour shift on the Sab-
bath. And while it was still shivering over
the possibilities, it also learned, this time
from Willie Watt, that it would be a dread-
ful thing if the railway service was liable
to have its hours discussed by a Judge of the
High Couiwff Australia.
The first line of telegraph opened in S.A.
belonged to a private individual, Mr. James
Mac George. The wire stretched from Ade-
laide to the Port, and business over it
started on November 26, 1855. The Gov-
ernment, however, acquired it after running
in opposition for a while.
UNHEALTHY LODGINGS.
THE LITTLE CHAP: "Good heavens , Alfred , I
should hardly have known you! ”
At its recent conference the Maoriland
Federation of Labor carried a resolution an-
nouncing that on a declaration of war by
any of the Great Powers, the conference is
prepared to recommend a general strike.
That settles everything. Japan and Russia
w|ll never dream of commencing hostilities
now that they know the trade of Wanganui
will thereby be dislocated.
“Oom Bill” Lyne, stalwart ancient and
good Australian, still holds the solid respect
of the Labor party. He is allowed to call
himself by any political name he likes, and
no Labor candidate is to be run against him
for the Hume seat. It is a decent tribute
to a man who did his best in the cause of
Australian industries, and, on the whole,
did it strongly and well.
Willie Watt says that he has worried him-
self nearly bald trying to think how the Aus-
tralian Parliament can regulate prices. The
price of sugar throughout Australasia has
for years been fixed by the C.S.R., and,
instead of losing his valuable hair over it,
Willie should have written to Mr. Knox and
got the information. Or if he doesn’t know
Mr. Knox, and won’t ask any other Ma
Stater, he might have a word or two with
some of the jam manufacturers of his own
Cabbage patch. The only question the public
has to decide is whether it is better to let the
Trusts or the Government fix the prices. It
has come to this —-one or the other must
do it.
Speaking against the proposal, embodied
in the Referenda, to bring State railway ser-
vants within the jurisdiction of the Arbi-
tration Court, Willie Watt asked his Moonee
Ponds supporters: —
Is there any man living of you who thinks there
would not be chaos with a Railway Minister and the
Cabinet determining the policy of management, but
having nothing to say about the wages their servants
shall receive ?
But why should a wages award cause chaos
in a business managed by a Board of Minis-
ters. any more than in one run by a Board
of Directors?
W. D. Johnson, Minister for Works* in
Westralia’s Labor Government, has been
telling the Maoriland people that Massey’s
scheme of elective instead of nominated
Councillors is good goods, especially for
Labor. Yet, long ago, the Labor party in
Australia decided that the abolition of the
Councils was the best thing for Labor and
progress—in fact, that it was about the
only way to get within cooee of real reform.
Perhaps Johnson, like McGowen and Hol-
man and a sackful of others, reckons the
party’s platform is like the presentation
clock that stands on the drawing-room man-
telpiece under the glass case —merely orna-
mental.
The S. M. Herald gave another airing to
a decrepit old gag last week. The Sydney
Ferries Co. makes such prodigious profits
that it not only pays 10 p.c. on capital which
has been repeatedly watered, but has supplied
itself with a whole fleet of ferries out of sur-
plus earnings. It would not be too much to
say that the actual earnings of recent years
have been 25 to 30 p.c. per annum on the
capital actually put into the business by the
shareholders. Tempted by these prodigious
figures and the prospect of more bonuses
in the future, people have been paying ex-
travagant prices for scrip; and when the
bloated co. throws out a feeler about an in-
crease in fares, the Herald bids the public
be calm and remember that, though- the divi-
dends, etc., are big, investors are getting only
4 p.c. or so on their money. Now, supposing
some reporter went to the Herald and told
“Mr. James” that he had bought a house at
an exorbitant price, aud paid three times
more for his furniture than it was worth, and
that his wife was an extravagant piece of
goods who cost twice as much as she ought
to, would “Mr. James” keep calm and tell
the young man that his salary would be
trebled? Or if a paper manufacturer told
“Mr. James” that he had paid three times
the cost of a factory in order to get posses-
sion of it, would “Mr. James” feel called
upon to pay an exorbitant price for that
manufacturer’s paper, on the ground that
otherwise he wouldn’t get a fair return on
his investment?
Anti-Soshers who attribute the rise in the
cost of living to the existence of a Labor
Government will be puzzled to explain away
the latest estimates of the increased cost of
living in various countries. The figures,
extending over a period of 16 years, run as
follows : England, 27 per cent.; France, 18
per cent. ; Canada, 25 per cent.; Germany,
28 per cent.; America, 32 per
cent. Even the most untruth-
ful Tory paper would hardly
accuse Uncle Sam of living
under a Labor Government.
Scientific inquiries think the
principal causes are—(l) In
creased production of gold
(£41,000,000 in 1896, and
£94,193,000 in 1910), thereby
reducing the value of the sove-
reign as against other articles;
(2) combination among pro-
ducers and distributors, includ-
ing the factor known as
“trusts”; (3) higher wages to
workers. On the railways of
England this last item amounts
to something under Is. a week
per worker, so the tremendous
cut some workers are getting
out of the increase can be dis-
cerned at once. Anyway, what-
ever the cause, this is a magni-
ficent time to pay off our debt,
when Cohen will get compara-
tively little for our sov., and a
dashed bad one to borrow, when
we will get very little for
Cohen’s sov. When we wish to
practically borrow a railway
from Cohen, we want to do it
when we will get the most rail-
way possible for £1,000,000.
At present the time seems ripe
for getting the very least.
It was left to State Governor Fuller,
speaking at the A.N.A. luncheon in Mel-
bourne, to make one of the unkindest re-
marks to date about Alfred Deakin. Alfred,
he said, had “for many years been a figure-
head in Australasia.” Webster reckons
that a figurehead is “a person who allows
his name to be used to give standing to en-
terprises in which he has no responsible
interest.” But the Fusion was so hopeless
that even Deakin’s name failed to give it
any standing.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
“Old Parliamentarian” (B. 23/1 /’l3) accounts for
only two of the workers in the “free, secular and
compulsory” school agitation in N. S. Wales. Green-
wood did the talking, Dibbs backed him. But the
energetic secretary of the movement is still living—-
Mr. Walter S. Buzacott, the ship chandler of Market-
street. This writer was instructed once to wait upon
Mr. Buzacott and inquire what assistance Parkes gave
in the agitation. The answer was prompt and em-
phatic. “None! lie obstructed all he could. He
was an opportunist. When he found that public
opinion was with us he veered round and took a
hand.”
It isn’t always the ravening Socialist who
hounds the poor widow. English papers re-
port a case of one such woman charged
with shoplifting. She stated that owing to
the extra expense of the Compulsory Insur-
ance Act her employer had discharged her.
and she stole because she was starving. The
Bench expressed its disapproval of her glut-
tony by sentencing her to a month’s hard
labor. The amount of money 'which the
widow's employer was ashed to find under
the Act for her insurance was Sid. per week.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Last Saturday afternoon found a snort'
ing, howling nor’-easter raging over Port Jackson,
and except in a few sheltered nooks the waves were
running high, and the boats were capsizing right and
left. As far as yachting was concerned it was the
day of Prince Alfred Yachting Club, being the sort
of wind and water that yachtsmen revel in. The
Flying Squadron, however, in its open boats, had a
dandy time. The principal yacht race was an open
event, for trophies presented by Mr. Jenny, of Wan-
ganui (M.L.). Only four finished out of io starters,
and of these Petrel, steered by its owner,
Mr. Trebeck, was the greatest, making a mag-
nificent thresh to Manly, and overtaking and
passing the fleet on the way. After that
there was nothing else in it. Sunbeam and old-timer
Thelma had a great fight for second place, and Sun-
beam just managed to get along first. Rawhiti had
hideous luck; one of the crew fell overboard from
aloft on the wav to Manly, and another went over as
the yacht rounded the buoy. Fishing them out
practically put the big yacht out of the race. But
as if that was not enough, the yacht suddenly flew
wild and ran right over the 18-footer Kismet. Most
of the crew of the capsized boat scrambled on board
the Rawhiti, which then retired from the yacht race
and went after the human one in the water. It was
a day of disaster and breakdown.
* * * *
The open-boat racing in Sydney on Sat-
urday was a high-class exhibition of seamanship.
The wind, blowing strongly all the time, came with
savage puffs which must have been trying to the
fellows who were hanging over' the gunwales, heads
down, to keen the jigger right-side up. Kismet’s
sensational adventure with the big yacht Rawhiti
at Shark Island probably changed history, for the
wrecked craft was going great guns when it was
bowled over, and but for being run down would
almost certainly have won the race. Chris Webb,
in Australian, also struck disaster; owing to a
sprung mast he had to lower his canvas and drift
out, a practical wreck. In the first heat nothing
could get near Golding, till right on the finish Scot
came with a rush. But the time and the distance
to go were alike too short, and Golding blew through
with 12 seconds to spare. The final soon developed
; n+o another struggle between Golding and Scot.
After a long fight Scot managed to get about
Bsec. ahead of the persistent rival, and, being the
better boat off the wind, gradually forged ahead
and finally won by 30sec.
Ernest Barry, the English sculler, threat-
ens to retire from the game at the end of this year.
Barry is the only champion sculler the island has
raised within the past 35 years, but nobody can profit
by exploiting him. so his name is practically Mud—-
Thames mud. There is no “gate” to speak of in
sculling matches. All that a Barry can hone to win
is sufficient money and celebrity to carry him into a
decent pub and keen him there. It was the most that
champion nugs could look forward to in the old days,
ere stoushing became a gate money business. Bv the
wav. Bill Lang, having already achieved a pub in
Melbourne, talks casually of taking part in the old
game again.
The Felton-Towns sculling struggle on
the Parramatta yielded something of a record.
Among the barrackers aboard the steamers were four
ex-champions of the world—to wit. Beach, Peter
Kemp, James Stanbury and George Towns —watching
the downfall of C. Towns, another ex-champion.
* # * *
Alf Felton, who defeated ex-champion C.
Towns (never, by the way, much of a champion), is
probably the most promising sculler since the days
the bright eyes of “little Jim” Stanbury first peeped
over the rowing horizon. Felton is just 23, has a
finished style—in fact, one might say a bevelled-edge
style—and the strength of about three young bullocks.
Anything more opposite to the splashing style of
Dick Arnst it is impossible to imagine. Why Towns
was dug up to row against him is a mystery, as he
had absolutely no hope. But the match with burly
Jim Paddon, who resembles an elephant on a spider’s
chest when afloat on an outrigger, will make con-
siderable din on February 15, and should be worth
going far to see.

Swimmer Albert W. Barry, who proved
somewhat of a frost at the recent State champion-
ships, came along ae-ain at the carnival at Manly
(N.S.W.) last Saturday, when he broke the Aus-
tralian record for 100yds. in his heat, eoualled it in
his semi-final, and made a mighty fast slither in the
final. His time for the distance was 56 3-ssec.,
which was l-ssec. better than Long-worth’s best, put
up in January last year. However, it seems it wili
not be recognised on account of the conditions,
Barry having had the advantage of a high platform,
and the consequent impetus of a long dive. But it
was a superb swim, and so excellently done that
while he was by himself in the rear of the bunch he
did not seem to be travelling at all fast. But when
he caught his field, it was seen how swiftly he was
gliding through the water. Another good perform-
ance at the same carnival was that of S. C. Wright,
who won the 440 yards’ Championship of the Northern
Suburbs in fimin. 53sec. For an all-round tussle
that swim would take a lot of beating, Adrian and
Mason sprinting again and again. But Wright was
too strong and fast, wore them down, and finished
strongly, with fully 15yds. between him and* Adrian.
On Foundation Day, when hundreds of
boys all over the Commonwealth were trying to get
drowned through their inability to swim, a 12-year-
old Melbourne lad swam three miles in the Yarra.
The V.A.S.A. offered six small trophies for a three-
mile handicap. Out of 63 starters not more than a
dozen retired from the long job, though most of the
others were hopelessly outdistanced before they had
been an hour in the water. The winner took
to get the course, and the nipper aforesaid crawled
home an hour and a half after the race was won. He
had been nearly three hours in the water.

Duke Ivahanamoku, the famous Honolulu
swimmer, who made such a splash at the Olympic
gathering at Stockholm, nearly lost the number of
his mess last week. He had returned to his native
isles, and while swimming was attacked by what was
supposed to be the sea-serpent. It turned out to be a
giant conger eel, and was quite bad enough. The eel
meant business, and, finding the Duke was escaping,
it bit off a finger as a souvenir. This is a new and
most unpleasant horror.

N.S.W. professional swimming champion
Oscar Dickman put out his fins to some purpose last
week, when he created another world record by swim-
ming over 1000yds in 13min. 33£sec. at Sydney.
He was some potatoes before, but this makes him
bigger than ever. He now holds the world’s pro-
fessional records for 220 yards, 880 yards, 1000 yards
and the mile. Also, he is improving, and every time
he goes into the water he comes out better, to the
worry and grief of the handicappers. At present he
so. overshadows his brother professionals that all
prizes are regarded as mere gifts for Dickman.
Those harmless, unobtrusive persons,
known as “fanciers,” who indulge in the pastime of
pigeon flying, are much exercised over the irregulari-
ties of a well-known breeder who captured several
fair prizes and much kudos for his birds by the
simple expedient of entering them at Adelaide for an
inter-State race, sending them to Melbourne, and then
having them returned per train instead of letting
them come per wing. Of course, sooner or later, some
inquisitive fancier was bound to spot the birds en
route, and this duly happened, and now the South
Aus. Homing Association is considering whether to
merely disqualify the offender for evermore, or to ask
the law to deal with him. To avoid similar bother in
future, this paper would recommend the South Aus.
Association to hold its homing matches from (say)
Darwin to Oodnadatta. From appearances it
will be several years before the Transcontinental ex-
press will outpace the average;“homer.”

Motor-cyclist C. Mundy, whose Sydney-
Melbourne record was recently bettered, is on his
way to Darwin, where he hopes to secure a Daly River
farm in the forthcoming ballot.
One complete round of club games having
been played, East Torrens is still easily top of Ade-
laide cricket. This is unexpected, for, of the club’s
eight inter state men, Whitty and Mayne have not
been available much so far ; Crawford has removed to
another district and “Solly” Hill to Sydney; Roy Hill
and Con Chamberlain are now past their best, and
Stirling has not lived up to his early promise. The
three last, however, are still useful, and Len Cham-
berlain is at the top of his form ; also, Middleton is
a new and strong candidate for inter-State honors.
North Adelaide, the club of Gehrs, Rees and Reedman
(still going strong), is a bad second, with Sturt,
Clem Hill’s district—though Clem seldom plays in
club games—a close third.
* * * *
Under ordinary circumstances, another
round of First, Grade cricket would have com-
menced in Sydney on Saturday; but as the coming
week-end will see the Victor Trumper Benefit Match,
the circumstances were voted (extraordinary. So
Grade Cricket was off, and the afternoon was devoted
to friendly matches, the idea of slicing a round in
two with a big fixture being distasteful. Trumper
himself put in the time by raiding Glebe with an
XI which contained a pair of overseas players, one
from England and one from Africa. But Glebe, un-
dismayed, fell upon the invaders and dismissed them
for 143, Freeman taking six wickets for 48 runs,
Watson two for 12. and Cotter one for 40. It fol-
lowed un the repulse by whacking 243 for the loss of
five wickets. A veritable rout.
* * * *
While the “champagne of cricket” was
bein"- put down at Glebe, Queensland and Victoria
were struggling at Brisbane, where the Bananaland
team had accumulated 330 runs on the first attempt.
The men of mark were Thompson (116), Evans (75)
ahd Sheppard (42). Victoria did not shine by con-
trast, and made only 256 in reply, the scorers being
Brown, 63 ; Armstrong. 60: E. V. Carroll, 131 ;
and the other Carroll, 29. When stumps were drawn
Queensland had started on the second round and hit
41 for the loss of two sticks. The bright particular
feature of the game up to that point was the bowl-
ing of Downev, who took seven Victorian wickets
for 97 runs. No one else got near him.
* * * *
Adelaide (S.A.) cricket on Saturday last
was blessed with a hurricane performance by E R
Mayne, who smote 237, not out, in 215 minutes, at
the expense of the bowlers from Sturt. L. Chamber-
lain, with a useful 95, helped Mayne to raise East
Torrens’s score of 417 for three wickets. Other
smiters worthy of a cheer were the colts N. L.
Gooden (140) and H. Bridgman (81), who smacked
most of the West Torrens score of 305 for six
wickets.
* * * •
Sundries has been a good scorer in the
Sheffield Shield matches this season. For Vic the
12th player pocketed 93, for S.A. 86, and for
N.S.W. 63. Time someone said something severe
about this player being allowed such a free leg.
“Blackbut” : Nothing finer has been shown
in wicket-keeping than the work of Victorian stumper
W. Carlceek against N.S.W. Not until 335 runs
were on the board did the first leg-bye happen along,
and Carkeek guarded his position so carefully that
in N.S.W.’s total of 640 only one sundry was credited
against him, the other seven being wides, leg-byes
and no-balls. In fact, only pne whirl of the leather
out of 750 fired at the opposing batsmen missed
Carkeek’s gloves.
Saturday in Melbourne was a day when
it was the business of. everv batsman to bog in if
he wanted his side to win. Few, however, tried to do
it, though in one or two cases they had the excuse
of good bowling against them. St. Kilda was up
against North, and Hotchin (who has been lustily
kicking at the selectors’ door for some time) and
Ainslie spent most of the afternoon at the wickets
on their little lonesomes, the total at six o’clock
being 309 for four wickets —Hotchin 121, Ainslie
135. North has now Buckley’s chance of winning,
though it may make a draw. East, with Seitz and
Baring away in Brisbane, found P’ran’s second-rate
bowling too good for its own third-rate batting, and
laboriously compiled 121 in three dragging hours.
’Roy lost the toss to Carlton, and, with bowler
Cannon away, spent most of the afternoon getting
its opponents out for 173, which score should be
easily beaten next Saturday. Richmond made spas-
modic attempts to put a decent score on the board,
but found bowler Kyle, formerly P’ran’s mainstay, in
rather deadly form. It had raked together 255 for
eight wickets by closing time, of which Stewart ac-
counted for 112. Essendon scraped up 172 against
’Varsity, which little lot Hartkopf should about
beat by himself this week end. ’Wood, having the
bye, filled in the afternoon against the sub-district
of Hawthorn, and had the satisfaction of discovering
that its new wicket-keeper, one Nyman, is also a
batsman of parts. He rattled up 135,; n. 0.; but, of
course, Hawthorn’s bowling, like its: politics, is not
inclined to be progressive.
“A Cricket Crank”: This year’s Sheffield
Shield struggle is making much excitement in cricket
bungalows. The defeat of Victoria at Sydney nar-
rowed things down to the point that Victoria has only
to successfully jump on S.A. to make two wins all
round, and then it will be necessary to hire a cunning
mathematician to pull the winner out of the tangle.
At present, with one match to go, things stand thus:

“Adelaide” : South Aus. was as interested
as the players themselves in the recent cricket match,
N.S.W. v. Vic. More so, in fact, than Trumper and
Co. were, for, owing to the failure of the side sent
to Adelaide and Melbourne, Ma has no chance of the
Sheffield Shield this year. Her best team just beat
S.A. in Sydney, and now that it has beaten Vic., too,
Clem Hill and Co. are on “a bit to nothing.” That
is, if they beat Vic. in the only match remaining to
be played, they get the Shield easily, and if they lose
the score will be two won and two lost, all round; in
which case S.A. must almost certainly make the best
showing on averages, having won by an innings from
the aforesaid N.S.W. side.
In the course of a cricket match in Albert-
Park (Melbourne), on Foundation Day, a batsman
with no legs was given out “leg before.”
The English tennis four put in part of a
day on the Adelaide Oval, each man getting a single
and a double. Roy Taylor, Bowen (playing in
glasses), Justin O’Dea and R. V. Thomas were not
much use to the visitors in singles, but put up a good
fight in the doubles. Young Thomas was the only
one to increase his reputation ; he always had veteran
Dixon thinking, and took one set singly and one (with
O’Dea) in the double. Those two sets were S.A.’s
only score. Governor Bosanquet presided at the lunch,
and started a controversy by asserting that two hours’
tennis gives as much exercise as four hours’ golf.
Though well on in the 60’s, Bosanquet himself plays
both.

The Melbourne Six-Days’ Race is to com-
mence on the night of February 24, and will rage till
the night of March 1. The McNamara-Corry team
which scooped the pool at Sydney is competing, with
seven others who took part in the same tussle, and
with teams representing Vic., Tas. and South Aus.
Applehans and Rosseau did not wait for the event,
but started last Saturday for Paris, taking with
them the Tasmanian rider Keefe, who intends to try
his luck on the big European tracks. His head-
quarters will be Paris.

Seven years have come and gone since the
last Motor Reliability Test between Sydney and Mel-
bourne raged through the astonished' continent, and
created almost as much excitement as the Balkan
war, and people had given up the idea of ever seeing
another. But there is to be at least one more, as
the Automobile Club of Australia, as the Sydney
concern magniloquently calls itself, is co-operating
with the Victorian body to run “a sealed-bonnet
reliability touring contest” on March 26, 27, 28 and
29. The only stipulation is that there shall be at
least eight entrants from each State. The affair is
to be controlled by a joint committee representing
the two high contracting parties, and at time of
writing sundry enthusiasts known as the “roads and
tours committee” of the N.S.W. body are at work
drafting a set of rules fqr the government of the
contest, to be submitted to the men of Victoria.
Originally it was proposed that there should be a
teams race, N.S.W. versus Victoria, but that idea
has been dropped, and the struggle will be a straight-
out individualistic one. As proposed, there will be
no great strain on the participants, as the 572 miles
run is to be spread over four days, and will be along
the main southern route through Goulbitrn, German-
ton and Albury. It will be more in the nature of
a picnic than anything else, as it is unlikely that
the contestants will do as they did on the occasion
of the first Test, when they raced for their very
lives and made a speed contest of it. One experience
of that sort was enough. Although the notice is
short, it is possible that cars from Tasmania, South
Aus. and Queensland will take part.
If a recent ropgistrate’s decision nndor
the new Cruelty to Animals Act holds good, Westralia
may set the Commonwealth a good lead. A shooter
at a Perth pigeon-murdering match dropped a bird
outside the boundary; and as under the club rules
he wasn’t permitted to pick it up from that position,
the unfortunate fowl flapped around in its gore for
a quarter of an hour. The Act provides a £lO fine
for anyone ill-treating any animal, and the magis-
trate sensibly held that wounding was “ill-treating,”
and said 10s. and costs. A lot of people—including
pigeons—have been awaiting a law of that sort for
a long time.

A Melbourne promoter tells of a well-
known Australian lightweight coming to him with
tears, in his eyes, pleading for a brother pug. “Gor-

Freddie Welsh, the vegetarian light-weight
who beat ITughie Mehegan at the National Sporting
Club last month, showed the Australian camp some
subtle points one way and another. For example it
leaked out, during the training, that Welsh had had
one of his eyes so badly opened that stitches were in-
serted. Frederick entered' the ring on the night of
battle with an ominous-looking wound showing
under a mass of sticking-nlaster over his right eve
Mehegan, in accordance with the custom of his trade'
devoted a large part of his attention to the injured
antic. He connected with it time and again. But
though he knocked the sticking-plaster to blazes, he
failed to draw blood. The explanation lay in the
met that it was the other eye which was in trouble
The wound was bogus—a tribute to the skill of ari
artist in theatrical make-up.

Queensland’s more or less amazing aborig-
inal bruiser, Jerry Jerome, met Arthur Cripps before

Herbert McCoy got the surprise of his lif„
at Sydney Stadium last week when he met Jack P i
for the Resident Lightweight Championship of a!,
tralia. He expected a cyclone for half a dozen round
—he had met it before —but he also expected that S
time went on the storm would blow itself out h
caught the tornado all right; in the second round it
laid open an old wound, and he bled profuselv
McCoy is particularly game, and finding he was eet
ting behind on points, he raged in with terrific sDenrt
trying hard for a knock-out. But Read has improve,!
out of sight since he has been training with the nig
gers, and he, too, considered that the best defence
was to be the attacking party. So they both at
tacked, and there was much rushing and clinching
It went the full 20 rounds ; and although
McCoy would score a round, he was unable to keen
pace with his leaping opponent, and when the
sounded the truce, referee Scott immediately pointed
to Read as the winner. There was some awful
thumping in the fight, but barring the re-opened
wound on McCoy’s nobility, there wasn’t much to
show for it —which proves what a splendid thing n
is to be thoroughly fit.
On Saturday night Midwood, the huskv
youth who but recently emerged from the amateur
ranks, and who, after being knocked down bv De
Balzac four times in one round, got up and won' met
Dave Smith at Sydney Stadium. They started ’vim-
fully, and it was immediately seen that Smith had
durine- his travels completely changed his method of
fi<rhting. He used to be a boxer of the Australian
tvpe: now he is a scrambling, wrenching fighter of
the Yankee order, and his chief weapon of offence is
a right cross. While Midwood used a straight left
and used it hard, he could keep Smith off, as for
some reason Smith dislikes being hit on the nose and
jaw. A tap on the nose will always disconcert him
But when Midwood ceased to poke out his straight
left. Smith lifted his eyes to Heaven and murmured
“The. Lord hath delivered him into mine hand!” And
then he got in close and used the right cross
Although it was soon obvious that Smith was too
good a ring general for his opponent, Midwood fought
on doggedly, and took punishment by the cartload.
Knocked down again and again, he was twice saved
by the gong, and an enthusiastic crowd cheered him
as they have rarely cheered a boxer in Sydney before.
Seconds and admirers alike clung to the hope that
he would land one wild whirling blow on Smith's
chin —the sort that Smith doesn’t like—and out him.
But as time went on he lost the power of attack.
What punches he did give had no sting in them, and
Smith bored in for a knock-out. But though he
butchered Mid wood badly, Smith was unable to knock
him out. Midwood had an awful time in the ninth
round, and early in the 10th he was knocked down
again, and while he was taking a count the towel
was thrown in and Smith declared the winner.
All the same, he should have been disqualified.
He won the fight fairly enough, but while Midwood
was down he hopped on to the ropes and sat there,
and by resting and removing his feet from the floor
of the ring forfeited the fight, according to the rules.
Referee Scott was busy counting, and did not see the
breach. He had scarcely time to do so, for hardlv
was Smith on the ropes before he was literally blown
off them by the blast of indignant hooting. It was
terrific. A dozen steamer sirens suddenly let loose
could not have made a more appreciable din; and
Smith fell off the ropes as though an elephant had
kicked him in the back of the neck. Of course, it
looked horribly flash and infernally ungenerous to a
brave opponent, but, all the same, those who know
Smith best are quite sure that it was merely thought-
lessness. He was feeling good, and was so delighted
to feel that way, after so many rounds with so hard
a hitter as Midwood, that he just hopped up to let
off his exuberance. However, apart from the incident,
the question, that occurs to one is whether Smith has
gone off or is Midwood a coming star. He is fright-
fully inexperienced, and the failure of Smith to out
him or beat him to mush in less than nine rounds
suggests that Smith is not a rising star of any magni-
tude.

As everybody expected, the N.S.W. Rugby
League has secured the tenancy of the Sydney Cricket
Ground for the coming season : and the Rugby Union
has gone down before the weight of the other crowd's
bloated money bags. The Rugby Union’s inability
to reform itself has practically “bust” that body,
unless the other body perpetrates a bigger buster
against itself, which doesn’t seem likely while the
present level-head^ l management is maintained. So
it is probable that the star match of each week in
the coming season will be staged at the well-appointed
Sydney Cricket Ground. If the League can induce
the bar to stock a better range of drinks, it will
be a boon and a blessing to the thirsty and shivering
onlookers. The bar badly wants reforming.

How a man does go down hill once he has
ceased to be a managing director and is merely
“the accused”! On Monday the Sydney papers an-

merely “The Williams Case.” Sic transit gloria

Gunn’s motor-cycle record between Syd-
ney and Melbourne is still unbroken, although no less
than eight attempts have been made upon 'ft-
Mechanical troubles counted five out, two attempts
were ruined by the riders getting bushed and taking
wrong tracks, and tyre troubles smashed up the other.
The best attempt was Tyler’s dash, but be didn’t dash
fast enough. At Yass he was 2hr. 15min. behind
Gunn’s time; at Gundagai, 2hr. 50min. ; at Alburv,
lhr. 55min. ; at Benalla, lhr. 39min. From Benalla
to Seymour their times were the same. Then Tyler’s
pace quickened, and 35 miles from Melbourne it
looked as though he would succeed in lowering Gunn’s
figures. But just at the critical time his machine
went wrong, and he proceeded to Melbourne per
motor-car.
“Armes” whispers words of comfort: —
Five students of Duntroon Military College have
been fired out, not for misconduct, but because the
authorities say they have not the brains. Now, I sav
to such fellows, “Buck up.” One of them may be-
come Commander-in-chief. Wellington’s mother said
he was a fearful dunce—an unmitigated disgrace
alongside his clever brother, afterwards known as
Wellesley. General Phil Sheridan, the most brilliant
figure in the U.S. Civil War, was put back a year
at West Point. Grant came out low down there, and
might have been rejected. Napoleon was not brilliant
at the Military College, and for seven years after en-1
tering the army it did not appear that he would make
good. On the other hand, Stonewall Jackson was a
brilliant College Professor. Caesar, Cromwell and .
Clive never had any military instruction. And quit- j
ting the military profession for a last minute, I re-
call that a well-known teacher at the Melbourne
Church of England Grammar School, nicknamed
Peggy, declared that Oscar Asche could not be en-
trusted even with a little part in the College thea-
tricals.
HYDROPLANING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Comes a sudden, frenzied stutter
And along a white spray gutter
Scoots the noisy hydroplane.
You must blink and peer again
Ere you sight the standing figure
’Mid the spray dust that the jigger
From the rippling surface smashes
As its clean-cut bow it dashes
When it’s jumping off its tail.
From the wave tops see it springing,
As its loud explosions ringing
Wake the watching, wooded shores.
Oh! it clatters and it snores,
Straight across the level sea 1
And its quiv’ring hull is lashing
Straight across the elvel sea!
Streaking past the white sails blowing,
Never swerving, never slowing,
Goes the oscillating thing ;
And it runs across the water
Like a wildfowl from the slaughter
Making sudden foolish flights ;
With broad flashes it alights;
Then the small propeller racing
Tears to foam the Summer sea,
And it rushes, whitely lacing,
As if Nick himself were pacing,
And the engine’s deaf’ning sputter
Swiftly sinks into a mutter ;
But the clatter of its flight
Drifts across both bay and bight,
While the glimmer
And the shimmer
Of its foam remains in sight.
It is just a water devil when it rips
across the main,
Is the splashing, dashing, lashing,
petrol-driven hydroplane.

The other Monday a Melbourne house-
breaker was captured by a local police ser-
geant under circumstances which reflected
great credit on the vigilance of —the neigh-
bors. The neighbors, having discovered the
man’s presence in a house during its owner’s
absence, kept him boxed up like a rat in a
trap whilst the police-station was being
rung up. Hence the capture. House-
breakers run in all shapes, and this was one
of the oddest creatures in the business. He
might have been dressed for a quick-change
act in a panto. He wore two coats, one
sweater, a couple of vests, and an obviously
false beard—a bushy black beard of the
Pirate King pattern. Also, he was armed
with a revolver, loaded in five places, and a
number of fishhooks. The loaded weapon,
which appeared to be damning evidence of
his murderous character, proved to have
been recently taken from another unguarded
villa residence. Its lawful owner had bought
it to protect himself against burglars, and
apparently the first burglar who came along
had stolen it.
“Bash” presents the fruit of long re-
search :
The building' which is not to be pulled down for
the erection of the Morning Hellagraph’s 97-
storey premises was first tenanted by Dr. Angel
Money, vvho was succeeded in 1850 by one of tne
Six lamilies. This family (No. 5) refused to give
space in the backyard for George Coppin’s Iron
Pot, but, some 25 years later (October, 1839), it
allowed Governor Bligh and John Pascoe Fawkner
to establish in the kitchen the first Australian jam
factory. The Iron Pot was used in the process.
The quandong jelly turned put by the firm was
lavishly patronised by the original Hordern and
E. W. Cole. Mr. Hordern was then (1805) on the
historic slope of Flagstaff Hill, not far from the
West Melbourne swamp. Before this he had founded
the first paper in Adelaide, for which he had
Thomas Makdougall Brisbane as junior devil and as-
sistant sweeper-out. lima de Murska and Teddy
Lonnen were at that time (1895) appearing in a
patter-and-dance turn at the Olympic Josshouse of
Varieties. Lola Montes gave sacred songs at the rival
house. The popular drink of the period (1789) was
raspberry hush, so named by The Bulletin’s Reli-
gious Editor from the appearance of Lola’s face one
Good Friday Night when the grease-paint ran. It
(the raspberry hush) was a mixture of champagne
and oyster cocktail, sipped with a straw through a
tinned peach. Lord Beerthirst and J. S. Butters
had no time for it, but when Garnet Walch wrote
“Joseph of Canaan” for Little Tich and Lottie
Collins (opening in Perth on Boxing Night, 1863),
a party from Robert Lowe’s country house at Glenelg
Beach, including John Thomas Smith and the non-
coms of the 17th Regiment, were greatly delighted
by a topical reference to the novel drink, added
to Walch’s play by W. M. Akhurst and Joe Jeffer-
son. Lowe was a lavish patron of the arts. His
name appears in the list of subscribers to the first
novel published at Port Darwin (1767) —the joint
masterpiece of “Curse o’ Moses” and “The Oldest
Inhabitant.” This work, “The Convict Cowpuncher,
being Passages in the Life of Peder Pedersen,” was
published in a subscription edition of five vols. at
355. net, or in one vol., with a three-color cover, at
9d., to be exchanged at any time on payment of
tuppence. Four hundred and eighty sets of the
edition de luxe have been offered at various times
to the Library of the Australian Parliament, at the
moderate average price of 84 guineas, but, to the
lasting disgrace of this great nation, it was resolved
by Mr. Willis that the Speaker be no longer heard,
and that bas-reliefs of scenes in the life of Bacon
be added to the Cook monument as the result of a
concert to be given by Amy Castles, under the aus-
pices of the Dickens Fellowship, together with a set
of the works of Bernard O’Dowd, presented by the
Shakspeare Society.
Maoriland’s High Commissioner, Tam
Mackenzie, is to be the guest of George V.
when that potentate goes along to inspect,
the big warship that Maoriland told John
Bull to build, out of his own pocket, and
keep for himself as a gift from a dutiful
child. The invitation is no doubt intended
to assure M.L. that its interest in the ship
(about per cent, on a couple of millions)
is being kept steadily in view.
“Melb”: Conductor Steinmetz, of St.
Patrick’s Cathedral here, writing to the
press, makes a statement which interests
li.C.’s all over the Globe. Steinmetz de-
clares that the so-called “Proper” of the
Mass is sung according to the Pope’s direc-
tion, in Gregorian, and that the rest doesn’t
matter, wherefore it is filled up with inno-
cent selections from Gounod, Beethoven,
Mozart, Haydn, Guilmant, Saint-Saens,
Paladilhe, Rousseau, and the other great
composers. The purists, nevertheless, still
assert that the Pope has explicitly ruled all
such composers out; and this is the view
taken by the Melbourne Jesuit Churches of
St. Ignatius and the Immaculate Concep-
tion, which have restored the simple old
fashioned Gregorian throughout. On the
other hand, bear in mind that Archbishop
Carr saw the Pope lately, and has not said
a word about the Cathedral music.
“Pariah’s” township :
Five out of every 10 Victorians know that Colac
is on the Gippsland line. The other five can tell
you exactly where it is. It is on page 26 of the
Victorian Railway Guide. That and 12s. 9d. will
get you there.
The residents are very proud of the Murray-street
drain, which, with others, disembogues into a swamp
nearly in the heart of the town. It is not a nice
swamp.
There is also a butter factory, which last year beat
all the Maoriland factories in the prices obtained in
London for its butter. This concern pays suppliers
from £14,000 to £29,000 monthly. In the pay
office there is—or was —a conspicuous collection box
for the local hospital. One month’s contributions
totalled 9d.
Though most of the branch roads are from bad to
worse, the councillors are fortunate enough to have
their dwellings on what good ones there are.
The main topics of conversation are cows, onions,
potatoes and cows.
The ladies are great on politics of the Liberal
persuasion. Said I to one of the most prominent:
“But the Liberal party has no platform!” “Oh, yes,
they have,” she said. “Well,” I replied, “what is
it?” Said she: “I’ve forgotten just for the moment,
but I’ve a copy in my desk.”
The shire has an overdraft of over £2OOO. The
rate is Is. 6d. on a 20-odd year-old valuation, and
in reality is only a 6d. or 9d. rate. To rectify this
the council intends shortly to raise a loan.
Professor Warren, of Sydney University,
is not only spreading far and wide a useful
knowledge of Australian timbers, but is con-
tributing to the scientists of Europe much
valuable information about the methods of
determining the commercial properties of
timbers generally. Half the enthusiast’s
life has gone in the engineering workrooms
of Sydney University, where the testing of
iron and timber has been his chief occupa-
tion. When he took up the school 29 years
ago his material equipment was extremely
limited, but he and his pupils set out to
make weights, scales and other necessary in-
struments out of the materials about them,
and with even these homely contrivances he
succeeded in reaching important results.

achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.

SAVED FROM THE SEA.
Slowly drifted a raft o’er the wide ocean blue
Grimly laden with a ghastly shipwrecked crew,
In spite of the efforts of a young officer Brave
One by one they dropped into a watery grave,
Submerged to their armpits by the spray of the sea
To the doleful raft clung the remaining three,
Only the officer survived the following Day,
His comrades from exposure having passed away,
With an effort he raised himself on his knees
And beheld a ship loom on the dashing seas,
Picked up and attended upon a huge liner Deck
Was the sole survivor of an appalling Wreck.
Still: Several years too late with your devil.. ..
J.D.C.: A faint bleat from pleasant pastures.....
Verdon: Some chemist with a new antibilious pill
might use it as an advt.... Rialto: They hobble most
of the way and jump the rest.... Ivory: Decent try,
but it misses. .. .Josh: Gosh !... .J.S.: The idea is
striking, but the services of the verse carpenter will
be required if it is passed. Poem now awaiting the
decision of the office High Court... .E.J.B. (W.A.) :

dry southerners: “Mackay (Q,.), Jan 12th.—As I
write it is raining. The southward is under water,
bar the roads. It began to rain on the 4th. On the
6th January the paper stated 84 inches had fallen in
24 hours. That is a week ago within 24 hours, and
it is beating down still. We have a sewing machine
going and a phonograph, but the rain and wind
drowns the lot, while the fowls are roosting on the
telephone wires.” After reading that, we looked
sadly at our dusty goloshes and moth-eaten umbrellas
and perspired two quarts. .. .E.C.8.: Very ragged and
unskilful. Previous effort must have been a whole
heap better.... Attis : Three-god poem firmly declined.
. ...G.H.: Don’t tell us your surname is Reid! The
verses suggest that it is, but we thought you had
given up rhyming—that is if you are the person we
mean. . . .Dunrock : “First effort—shall I continue?”
Why did you ever begin ?... B.: No. .. A.W.S.: Fourth
gallant charge repulsed. Afraid you will have to re-
treat once more and re-organise your shattered lines.
. ...E.K.: Verses very poor. Story fairly ingenious,
but has not got enough flesh on its ribs. .. .Belli-
cose : Sure you’re wrong. He is a mild ajnd gentle
fellow, who seals dooms and consigns people to ap-
palling fates in the kindest manner possible. .. .Still:
Chillagoe poem is just pantomime jingle, and requires
to be intoned by two comedians in exaggerated
clothes.... Jonquil: Regret none of the bunch are pp
to the mark Killena : Not dealt with yet
Jack Hardgraft: Unfortunately can’t see how anti-
Trust legislation is going to make the Outback store-
keeper any less of a cormorant. .. .J. 8.5.: You want
frank criticism. Well, judging by the sample sub-
mitted, you’ve got no more ear for poetry than a
hippopotamus. The rhymes are bad, the metre is
bad, everything is bad. .. .N.C.R.: But, instead of
merely suggesting that he was a thief and a bigamist
who probably ill-treated his mother, why didn’t you
say something to prove that the correspondent who
wrote the yarn about Gunnedah was all wrong in his
facts ? The one scrap of information in your letter
is that the town has absorbed 50,000 acres of one
property and 15,000 of a couple of others within
the last few years.... XO: Don’t know any book on
the subject; but if the man who wants to be a good
Australian will put Australia first, he won’t go far
wrong. .. .H.J.E.: But it doesn’t follow that the
B. H. Prop, will not spend more than £480,000. The
idea is to raise the balance on first-mortgage deben-
tures. All the same, the business has some most un-
pleasant features. For instance, the use of the power
of resumption in the interests of a private concern is
unwarrantable. Also, it is most dangerous Alf
Maher: If it is your idea that Hutton or anybody
else who had been hit, shouldn’t be given a chance to
hit back, it isn’t this paper’s. As for the rest, one
Shearer, of Queensland, has had an effective Sav. .. .
Chelsie: Pars, too wordv'; but much promise in the
verse. Glad to consider stuff submitted for any
section of the paper.
From the Old Soldier
In itself the recent export of a small mob of horses
to Japan (B. 30/l/’l3) doesn’t matter much. What
does matter is the craze for exporting everything the
foreigner can be persuaded to buy. The idea that
the best use he can make of his produce is to export
it, and that the less he uses for himself the more
thrifty he is, has been so persistently harhmered into
the Australian’s head that the belief has become
fixed; and the exports must be all the best, while
the worst is always good enough for home consump-
tion. So the export of stud stock —horses, cattle and
sheep—is regarded as a fine stroke of business, though
the local supply of the best class of stock is depleted
accordingly. Applied to the warhorse supply, the net
result is that the constant export of the best mares—
for the exporter insists on taking only the best—
results in the gradual deterioration of the breed.
There is no special breed of horses for war,. but
there are three very well-marked types—the heavy
draught for heavy artillery and transport, the lighter
draught for field and horse-artillery, the weight-
carrying saddle-horse for the obsolescent cavalry. The
mass of nondescripts wanted as mounted infantry
cobs, infantry officers’ chargers and packhorses need
not be considered. The three well-marked types are
important. If the Government establishes studs, it
will have to breed all three; but especially it will
have to breed the two draught classes, because the
utility in modern war of the old style of regular
cavalry is, at best, doubtful. The Japs won all their
victories in Manchuria without it, and they were op-
posed bv the most numerous, if not the best, cavalry
in the world.
It is more than 270 years since Cromwell wrote:
“If we had 2000 horses that could but trot 30
miles!” This is more or less the difficulty of every
commander. People who haven’t seen war have no
idea of the enormous demand for horses for transport.
After the first battle, not only are the waggons of the
ammunition columns emptied to fill those of the bat-
teries, but their horses are taken to replace the
casualties among the teams of the same batteries,
and have to be replaced somehow. It is quite likely
that no organisation of Government studs could pos-
sibly keep up with the Australian army’s demands
for horses for war, though ft would help by popularis-
ing the breeding of useful horses. What is impera-
tively necessary is to stop the export of brood mares
of the useful class. The blood horse is all very well
in its way, as a cross to breed in a dash of speed and
courage; but, now that artillery has an effective
range of 5000 to 7000 yards, and the infantry rifle
2000 yards, the value of mere spurts of speed is a
good deal discounted, and the ability to “trot 30
miles" becomes more valuable than ever.


What Those Who Know Say of the
BEALE HIGH-GRADE PIANOS.
7 he great majority of our Pianos are sold on the personal recommendation of users, and we are
constantly receiving letters from our customers praising the BEALE High-grade PIANOS. Our
instruments are in use in every part of Australia ; in New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia,
Mauritius, South Africa, India, and on the continent of Europe ; and everywhere they give the
same unbounded satisfaction.
Below we give a few (greatly condensed) extracts from unsolicited testimonials from buyers of
Beale High-grade Pianos.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
Mr. F. OWEN, jun., Hon. Sec. School of Arts,
Tuena: —
“Piano has Riven every satisfaction. People com-
petent to judge say it is the best instrument in the
district.”
Mrs. J. A. SWAIN, Kilphysic, Caroll:-
“Has tood the changeable seasons remarkably well.
We are all very pleased with it.”
Mr. G. JONES, Canterbury:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction. No hesitation
in recommending the Beale to anyone as the finest
piano procurable.”
Mr. E. E. VIDLER, Morisset: —
“Piano is in perfect order, notwithstanding the
fact that it has been in constant use.”
Mrs. ELLEN KILLEEN, Wolfram Street, Broken
Hill: —
“Has given every satisfaction. Tone is rich and
full: instrument has stood the Broken Hill climate
wonderfully ; better than any other piano that I know
of. Would recommend the Beale Piano to anyone who
wants a real good piano.”
Mrs. JOAN MASSIE, 44 Hunter Street, Newcastle: —
“The tone exceeds my expectations, being wonder-
fully mellow, while the external finish is very hand-
some. Several professionals have expressed their ad-
miration.”
Mrs. C. JENNINtIS, Blende Street, Broken Hill: —
“Better to-dav than when it was supplied to me
five years ago, and we have had some very severe
weather since then. The tone improves with use.
Can recommend the Beale Piano to anyone requir-
ing a first-class piano for tone, touch and dura-
bility.”
Mrs. F. RUDDOCK, Waimea, Walgett Street, Ka-
toomba: —
“Highly delighted with it.’’
Mr. J. SLATER, Killarnev, East Moree:—
“Wish to express my fullest satisfaction in every
way with the instrument.”
Mr. J. HOGG, Lithgow:—
“Piano has given perfect satisfaction.”
CHARLES R. RAYNER, Sec. Oddfellows’ Lodge,
Casino:—
Piano has given every satisfaction.”
Mr. A. GREEN, Burwood Street Junction, New-
castle :■ —-
“The time that it will remain in tune is wonder-
ful. I have had English and foreign pianos, but they
never remained in tune a quarter of the time, nor
came near the Beale for tone.”
Mrs. W. O’HARA, Wyalong:—
“More than pleased with my piano. Everyone who
has heard it admires its beautiful tone.”
Miss A. M. RUDDER, Kempsey:—
“Have no hesitation in saying that it would be
impossible to get a more satisfactory instrument

and brilliant, and its appearance as handsome as
the day it was bought.”
Mrs. C. C. GRAHAM, Temoin Street, Trangie:—
“Very pleased with Beale Piano. Always ready
to recommend your pianos to anyone requiring a
first-class instrument.”

Mortlake: —•
“Piano is a ‘gem.’ Has given every satisfaction.”
QUEENSLAND.
Mrs. M. McKINNON, 357 Bolsover Street, Rock-
hampton :
“Piano is perfect. A friend of mine who was
prejudiced against the Beale Piano, decided to get
one when she heard mine.”
Mr. A. R. ROBINSON, Sec. People’s Progressive
League, Adelaide Street, Brisbane: —
“Piano is giving great satisfaction. Many have
expressed their surprise at such a high-grade instru-
ment being manufactured in Australia.
Mrs. M. WARD, Mount Perry, via Bundaberg:—
“We are all very well satisfied with the piano.
Tone is excellent.”

“Thoroughly satisfied with the instrument.”
Mr. J. 11. ROGERS, Woolocot Street, Coburg:—
“Must say that everyone who has been to my
place has nothing but praise for the piano.”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Mr. H. J. ARMITAGE, Public School, Houghton:—
“Piano, which I have had for three years, has been
in constant use, and tone is as good as when I got
it. Pianists often remark on its great purity of
tone.”
Mrs. H. WALKER, AVandilo, Mount Gambier:—
“Must express my satisfaction with your beauti-
ful, sweet-toned instrument.”
Mrs. C. EVERETT, Renmark:—
“Much appreciated by all who play it.”
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Mr. G. A. BEECK, Katanning:—
“Self and family are more than pleased with the
Beale High-grade Piano.”
Mr. J. A. MILLS, York:—
“Quite satisfied with piano in every way.”
Mrs. C. POWELL, Linden Villa, Stirling Street,
Perth:—
“There is not a better instrument in Perth.”
Mr. T. WARD, Wagin, Western Australia:—
“Greatly satisfied in every respect.”
Mr. W. H. BROWN, Kalgoorlie:—
“Very pleased with the instrument. Much better
than I expected.”
TASMANIA.
Mr. W. K. DRAKE, Westburg:—
“Piano has given entire satisfaction. Have had
it two years, and it has not yet needed tuning.”
Mr. HENRY NEWTON, Launceston:—
“As good as the day I bought it. Can safely re-
commend to anyone. Good pianists have pronounced
it to be a first-class instrument. Touch and tone
are perfect.”
The above are just a few of the many testimonials that we are continually receiving
from users of Beale High-Grade Pianos.
Such success has only been obtained through our unwearying efforts to produce an
instrument of the best quality. That we have succeeded is proved by the opinions of
those who should know best —the users of our pianos.
To obtain this quality we have invented patent methods of construction which render
our pianos more durable, while retaining and enhancing all the musical qualities of the
great makes of the Old World. The use of an iron wrest-plank which is part of our
patent steel tuning-system —is as great an improvement in the art of piano manufacture
as was the superseding of the old wooden-frame by the iron-frame which is used in all
modern pianos. In addition, we have introduced many other improvements, such as our
method of building up the casework from cross : plies of wood which is all thoroughly
seasoned here, and hence tit to withstand Australian climatic conditions much bettei tha.n
timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate of Europe. In order to get the best of s 1 ed
artisans, we pay higher wages than those awarded by the W ages Boards m the various
trades. We naturally get the best artisans, and thus the best of skill. W e use only the
finest of materials.
We realise that an Australian-made piano is subjected to much closer scrutiny in
Australia than any imported piano, and therefore we make—we are compelled to make—
our pianos much letter than those of our competitors. But then, by making pianos in
Australia we are in a position to make them much better suited to Australian conditions.
Any competent cabinet-maker will tell you that timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate
of Europe cannot be expected to withstand Australian conditions of dry heat as well as
timber which is seasoned in this climate. This is a most important point in piano-
making, and is one good reason why so many foreign pianos develop cracked sounding-
boards, split tuning-systems and faulty casework soon after arrival in this country. But
no man can say that he ever saw a Beale piano with a cracked sounding-board. We
absolutely guarantee that the sounding-boards of the Beale Pianos will never crack in any
climate, because our special system of construction renders cracking an impossibility, at
the same time that it greatly enhances the tonal qualities of the instrument. Beale
pianos contain the only practical steel tuning-system in the world —so there can be no
question of splitting of the wrest-plank. And then our patented system of cross-plied
woodwork ensures permanence of the outside case of the pianos.
Be sure of this: the better musician you are, the more you will delight in a Beale High-grade Piano.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of
Beale Pianos.
Call and inspect the Beale Pianos now. Inspection does not put you under any obligation
whatever. You suit yourself entirely as to whether you puichase.
If you cannot call, write for Catalogue, which we will be glad to send post free. We sell for
cash or on easiest terms.

Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8.,
M.D., etc.,
writes: “Takingan interest in all
subjects relating to food, I have
procured samples of Sanatogen
and subjected them to experi-
ment. . . .
“ In my opinion, it is the or-
ganic phosphorus which makes
Sanatogen of such value. . . .
A series of experiments proved
that Sanatogen is easily and com-
pletely digested. I have arrived
at the conclusion that Sanatogen
is a substance of the highest
nutritive value, containing as it
does a large amount of organic
phosphorus—that is, phosphorus
which is offered to the tissues in
exactly the form in which it can
be easily absorbed. It is an ex-
cellent nerve food.’’
“The Medical Times”
says: ‘ 1 There is no doubt what-
ever that the nutrition of patients
taking Sanatogen improves won-
derfully, due, in all probability,
to its being easy of assimilation
and to the organic absorbable
phosphorus which it contains.”
A thousand times this number of Physicians endorse
SANATOGEN
The Royal Tonic Food.
Over fourteen thousand practising physicians have recorded in writing their high
opinion of Sanatogen, and many thousands more are daily prescribing it with the
mo6b beneficial results in cases of debility, brain fag, lack of vitality, sleepless-
ness, disordered digestion, poverty of blood and various wasting diseases.
Can you ask for more convincing testimony of Sanatogen’s value than the
fact that it is thus publicly endorsed and recommended by practically the whole
medical profession ?
Among the original letters in praise of Sanatogen which are filed for public
inspection, there are many from world-famous physicians wdiose names stand
for the highest scientific achievements. Their advice, and the example of
distinguished men like those mentioned here, it is safe for you to follow.
Irresistible as this evidence is, the reader can only realise the wonderful
revivifying effects of Sanatogen by taking it himself when his nervous system
and bodily strength have been undermined by overwork, worry or disease.
WRITE TO-DAY FOR FREE HEALTH BOOK.
You can buy Sanatogen at any chemists. Write to-day for a free copy of
Dr. Andrew Wilson’s health book, “The Art of Living.” Please mention this
paper, and address your postcard to:
A. WULFING h CO. , SYDNEY.
Prof. Dr. C. A. Ewald,
of Berlin University, writes: “I
have used Sanatogen in a number
of cases, mainly of a nervous or
neurasthenic origin, and have
obtained excellent results.”
Mr. Hall Caine,
the celebrated Author and Dram-
atist, writes: ‘‘My experience
of Sanatogen has been that as a
tonic nerve food it has on more
than one occasion done me good.”
Mr. W. Rhodes,
the famous Yorkshire Cricketer,
writes : “ I have given Sanatogen
a good trial, and found it a
splendid tonic.”
Mr. A. G. Hales,
the famous War-Correspondent:
“ I find my health benefits by
every tin of Sanatogen. It re-
vitalises a man, and is not a
drug.”

their own in the Stud Sections. This is their
WONDERFUL SHOW RECORD!
Between November, 1905, and December,
1912, they secured in the Stud Classes no
fewer than 49 CHAMPIONSHIPS. 113
FIRST PRIZES, 56 SECONDS and 24

The course of this gentle little concern is as placid
as a cucumber. It sticks to Ballarat and has no
branches anywhere else ; it is the one and only “pro-
vincial” bank on the mainland of the Commonwealth
—-the one and only bank whose head-office isn’t in a
State capital. Unfortunately, Ballarat, where it has
its home, isn’t violently progressive: so in the past
seven years the bank’s advances have moved along
only from £297,896 to £303,354. Its paid capital
is £85,000; add reserves, £83,193; total share-
holders’ funds, £168,193. The liabilities of all sorts
amount to £256,136. For every £1 of shareholders’
money in the business there is thus only 30s. 6d
of the public’s. Further, the liquid assets—all cash
and public securities —amount to £121,745. In view
of those figures, any depositor who loses sleep won-
dering whether his money is safe with this bank is
much too nervous to live long. Naturally, with so
little of the public’s money to play with, and with so
much .of the funds in liquid assets, the earnings are
not big. Calculated on the basis of capital and re-
serves combined, they work out as follows:
June, 1909 £5 3 2 p.c. June, 1911 £5 4 6pc
Dec., 1909 5 3 6 „ Dec., 1911 5 5 9
June, 1910 5 4 0 „ June, 1912 5 410 ”
Dee., 1910 5 2 8 „ Dec., 1912 5 7 3 ”
Even that would be impossible but for the centralisa-
tion of the business and the extraordinarily low ex-
pense rate. Run on its present lines there is no hope
of a quick rise for anybody, but there is every pro-
spect Of a very fair return with almost a minimum
of risk. Further, there is a steadily accumulating"
reserve*. which will either (if things go right) make
the dividend a shade better by-and-bye or (if things
go wrong) be a splendid protection for the capital. '

So far as the past half-year is concerned the direc-
tors’ report doesn’t tally with the published accounts •
but the directors’ report is probably wrong. Any-
aay, it has been assumed in the foregoing that it is
Like other Western (N.S.W.) collieries the Vale
ot Clwydd did poorly until the Ldhgow Coal Asso-
ciation was formed and they left off mutual throat-
cutting. The future depends largely upon the
maintenance of that or some similar arrangement -
and there is no reason at all to expect that it will
be disturbed. Through this association the co. has
been able not only to pay a good and regular divi-
dend, but also to put by a very handsome sum.
As at Dec., 1905, the assets other than land and
plant were valued at £14,748. Deduct liab lities
£2061, and you have £12,687 of more or less
liquid assets net. Now the more or less liquid
assets are £16,144; less liabilities £1243. leaving
£14,901 net. _ That increase from £12,687 to
£14,901 doesn’t look much for seven years; but
meantime £11,072 has been put into brickworks
Capital was increased from £30,000 to £45,000
in 1910; but that increase is represented’ by
value added to the mine and plant. So it boils
down to this: the co., while it has paid its divi-
dends, has in seven years made surplus profit suffi-
cient to pay for the whole of the new brick-makin"
plant, and there has been about £l5OO over, plus
anything put into mining property and plant
Altogether it is an excellent record, even though a
mine is a wasting asset, and a part of its apparent
profit is really used-up capital.
THE UNSUSPECTED BEGGAR
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sydney Ferries Co. has decided to increase the
rates for season tickets. The report submitted at the
half-yearly meeting yesterday contained the following
paragraph:—
“The past year has been one of exceptional activity
and progress. The expansion of the company’s busi-
ness is satisfactory, but the cost for a long time past
is greatly in excess of the new revenue earned, due to
increased rents, rates, taxes and cost of material, but
mainly to increased wages under the high award of
tVages Boards, and there appears to be no hope of
relief in these directions.” —Daily paper.
He was stout and he was sturdy, and his golden
watch-chain bright,
As festooned across his waistcoat, was a truly gorge-
ous sight;
All his clothes were new and shiny, and the radiance
of his tile
Almost dimmed the sizzling arc-lights. Oh, he was
a mass of style 1
But he blubbered on my shoulder, and in strangled
4 accents said,
“Can you spare a man a copper, sir, to buy a crust
of bread?”
He was fat beyond all reason, and his pink, clean-
shaven neck,
Flotving flood-like o’er his collar, almost made the
thing a wreck ;
He had diamond studs and sleeve-links, and his
cheque-book I could see
Resting in his silken pocket, as he leant and wept on
me.
“You are tight!” I muttered fiercely. “Cab-it home
and go to bunk!”
“I m an Unsuspected Beggar!” sobbed the stout, ap-
parent drunk.
“I’m an Unsuspected Beggar! I’m a stout and
gilded sham !
And, if honest folk rebuke me, well, I do not care a
d—n !
These misleading signs of richness are my everlasting
Curse,
For, upon me soul, I haven’t got a shilling in me
purse! ”
(Hot tears trickled through the fingers that he’d
spread out like a fan.)
“Help the Unsuspected Beggar, if you call yourself a
Man!”

IN BANANA LAND
Governor Macgregor told the Dalby people
he didn’t see how he could spend Sunday
better than in laying foundation-stones of
hospitals. The Chieftain is altogether a
quaint Caledonian. A Presbyterian by up-
bringing, he does mason work on the Saw-
bath. A countryman of Carlyle’s, he does
not smoke. A Heelander by descent, he
never touches whisky. If he hadn’t been
. coddled in the tropical climate of Papua and
North Queensland, he would long ago have
died of his virtues.
“Boswell” : With due respect to a “North-
ern Democrat” (B. 30/l/’l3), the Denham
Ministry isn’t half as strong as it looks on
paper. There are many sources of trouble.
Digby has got himself and the Courier into
a mess with the sugar-growers. The mer-
chants of South Queensland are screeching
in Paget’s ear that they want the same low
rate of carriage (55.) for every 37 miles of
railway as that obtaining on the Port Alma-
Rockhampton line. Denham at Adelaide
declared his allegiance to the Meat Trust,
which is feared even by Tories, the Demo-
cratic press having recently drawn their
attention to the fact that Uncle Sam is now
paying Mr. Trust Is. 7d. per lb. retail for
his bit of neck steak. On the other side, though
it has its faults in plenty, the “whole hog”
Labor party in Bananaland is Big Aus-
tralian to the core, and rightly looks upon a
State Frighter as a dangerous lunatic. And
Big Australianism is a growing cult, which
covers a lot of smaller sins. So, one way
and another, if the Laborites could precipi-
tate a State general election, in the present
state of the public mind, T. J. Ryan would
be a lot nearer the Premiership than he is
now.
Died recently, under very tragic circum-
stances, the manager of a Queensland
farmers’ milling co. An investigation of the
company’s affairs disclosed a deficiency of
nearly £6OOO. If the secretary of a Labor
Union had passed out under such circum-
stances, how the Tory press would have
blazoned the glad tidings !
Queensland is a country of strange juggles.
Explosives coming to Brisbane must be un-
loaded at Pinkenba and brought up bp
lighter. Heavy penalties are provided for
violation of the rule. But explosives bound
for Rockhampton must be unloaded at Port
Alma and sent on by rail. Kidston was re-
sponsible for this little bit of jugglery.
John Ivemp has been appointed City En-
gineer of Brisbane, where he has been en-
gineering for the Water and Sewerage
Board. Thomas Kirk, his predecessor, has
gone out on a gratuity equal to six months’
salary. If Kemp has the ability to effect
reforms and has a leaning that way, a great
opportunity is his in Brisbane. But he will
probably have to kill a few aldermen first.
Passed away a few days ago, aged 77, Geo.
Mant, a typical old-time Queensland squat-
ter. - Mant came to Queensland nearly 60
years ago, and was identified nearly the
whole of his long life with Gigoomgan station
and the successful breeding of shorthorn
cattle. He was firmly convinced that Aus-
tralia under Labor is booked for political
Sbeol, and he leaves a numerous family in
the full enjoyment of so much of the dis-
aster as has thusfar arrived.
“Doctor” Kidston alleges that “but for
certain personal reasons he would have
enjoyed a contest for Wide Bay with Mr.
Fisher.” No doubt. Sixty-five years and
the surrender of a snug sinecure of a thou-
sand per annum are very weighty “personal
reasons” indeed.
Home Sec. Appel has got a new ornament
for the outside of his waistcoat. There was
but one bridge left in Australia where a toll-
gate was still in business; this was over, the
Burnett, at Bundaberg. The other day this
sole surviving toll was abolished, and the
last threepenny-bit that was taken was
mounted in gold and passed on to the Mini-
ster.
“D.L.M.”: It is hardly an exaggeration
to say that in pear-ridden districts a
stalk of pear springs from every emu’s
footprint. When left to itself the seed
might not come up for years, and may per-
haps never grow at all, but after passing
through a bird it germinates immediately.
Some little time ago, 490 emus were yarded
in a flock in West-Central Queensland. The
yard was of wire-netting, 12ft. high, and
leading to it were two calico wings, a few
miles in length. Thirty horsemen spread
themselves out over the pear-and-emu in-
fested country, and turned all emus towards
the wings. Once they had the flock within
the calico arms they had only to galloD be-
hind. The emus were sold at a price which
covered all expenses, and the purchaser
made a handsome profit by converting the
flock into emu oil. The emu used to be a
protected bird, but it is now clear that if
human beings are to retain Queensland and
oust the prickly pear the emu must go.
The Great Illusion.
(Suggested, by Norman Angell.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Ape who long had teased the jungle tenants
With simian trick and guile and mad manoeuvres,
Whose dearest joy in life
Was dropping mighty nuts on mighty skulls
And peppering helpless hides with prickly fruits
That fell like hail and stung like Hell, and scattered
The wildings east and west,
Decided he would drop his aimless life,
Give up his friv’lous gibes and senseless jabber
And for the benefit of Life at large, and also
To cultivate the Soul the Lord had lent him,
Would turn Philosopher.
One morn he bent from out a bafiyan mighty
And thus harangued the Forest.
“ ’Tis plain,” he said, “that war among the beasties
Is at an end for various weighty reasons.
Imprimis, yonder Bear is stout and lusty,
And used to feed on fruits and roots and honey,
Of which he hath a most astounding store;
The Crocodile grows fat on roots of lotus
And finds the flags that fill the Nilus shallows
Afford a charming meal;
The Hippo, and the Elephant are peaceful;
The grim Rhinoceros surveys his wallow
With calm, contented smile;
And as to them with teeth and claw who raven,
Their ravening days are done,
For but yest’re’en I heard the Libyan lion
Propose to sundry Leopard folk and -Tigers
That they should blunt their teeth and swear upon
the altar
To ravage never more ;
Wherefore, I do conclude that War is over,
The Wolf and Lamb will lie down now in clover
And Peace will rule for aye.
And as his long harangue he gravely ended,
A burst of wild applause-rose up to greet him
Amid the enthusiastic jubilation
, Of every Carnivore.
Next day they named him Lord High Arbitrator,
Bade him descend to earth
And give his laws to all assembled creatures,
Who then and there would vow
To do his best without demur or murmur
No matter what it were.
The Ape came down.
“Now first I do decree,” he said, “that Leo,
The Forest King, do set a high example
To all his Subjects here in Court assembled,
And let me cut his claws.
My teeth are white and sharp, and I will straightway
Take up his mighty paws and trim them neatly
With great, exceeding joy.”
The Lion smiled ; his bloody claws extended
To our Philosopher, who bent to business
Without delay. A furious roar succeeded,
And then there came a scuffle and a scramble
And forty beasts were fighting in a fury
For forty simian bones.
MORAL.
From treetops preach your Peace without a pause,
But don’t get down to clip your neighbor’s claws.
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 1, 1913.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
Governor Macgregor took a day off yester-
day, and went to see the inter-State cricket
match. A collection of country shows
awaits his attention in the newly-hatched
month, and his time-docket is expected to
show some excuse for his wages.
Canon and Mrs. Pughe, with their pretty
and popular daughter Peggy, to-day left for
Sydney, where they will take an Orient
boat (or as much as they can get of it)
for London.
The State barge Lucinda wears the
pathetic expression of a very broken-down
gentlewoman. She certainly cannot help
her age, but she might be given a coat of
paint to advantage. And when that is done
she should be removed ftom her usual resting
place in one of the most unsavory parts of
the city. The day the Denmans literally
shook the dust of this city off their feet,
six rubbish carts occupied prominent posi-
tions on the frontage, and waved 428 striped
odors in farewell. Every distinguished visi-
tor is similarly mistreated.
Dr. and Mrs. Jackson gave a big at-home
at their gunyah at Toowong last night as
a farewell treat to daughter Morag, who will
leave for England so soon as her marriage
is signed and sealed next week. The hostess
wore black, and the bride-to-be was adorned
in pink. Most of the young things who go
to these glorifications were present, as well
as a fair representation of the elder folk
who don’t go so often on account of rheuma-
tism.
That popular medico, Dr. Hirschfeld, is
on his way back to Brisbane on the Scharn-
horst. Mrs. Hirschfeld is back from her
Melbourne visit, and is endeavoring, to cope
with the vagaries of carpenters and plas-
terers who are renovating the place against
the doctor’s return.
Next week will be a busy one for clergy-
men, bell-ringers, cab-drivers and waitresses.
On Monday, Ida Clowes, and one Webster,
of Sydney, will murmur the usual “I wills”
to a large and sympathetic audience. On
luesday, the Roe-Jackson wedding will
(D.v.) happen at 2.30; and at six o’clock
Miss Collins, of Tamrookum, and Lieutenant
Harris will put a match to the torch of
Hymen. Hard-grafting curates are hardly
ever out of their clerical bowyangs these
days, and are threatening to apply for a
wages board.
Two more engagements. The first prom-
ises pretty Cecile Taylor, daughter of Mrs.
Lumley Hill, to Whittingham, M.L.C. In
point, of age the prospective bridegroom has
the disadvantage of about a score of years,
but in tastes the two are well matched. The
lady is an ardent horsewoman, and an all-
round good sport. The second engagement
brackets “Chook” Powell (about as awful
as “Pip” Powell in the way of fancy names)
with the future of Miss Gladys Hobday, who
has inherited a goodly share of the artistic
talent of her father, the late J. S. Hobday.
The hostess at a recent “function” ex-
tended invitations to mere presswomen in
these graceful words: “You may come out
and look at the grounds, but you may not
come into the house!” She didn’t say what
was the matter with the house, but you
can’t be too careful these days, my dear.
So the forewarned took no risks.
This State had rather more than its share
of accidents last month. Since I wrote you
about 20 workmen were injured and one
killed at Balmoral, through the misfiring of
a fuse. On Wednesday, a train ran off the
lines at Murphy s Creek, between xpswich
and Toowoomba. The breakdown gang was
hard at work clearing the wreckage when
another train dashed into the party, killing
four outright and wounding others, of whom
three subsequently died. The usual inquiry
is to be held. It would be more satisfactory
if there was some inquiry before these ex-
traordinary mistakes are made. Another
derailment resulted in one more man losing
his life. It has been a gloomy and un-
profitable week for too many unlucky people.
The Adelaide Steamship Co. has ih th
stranding of the Innamincka, at the m™!'
of the Mowbray River, had the fi
misfortune which the Ravens prophesied r
it after the loss of the Yongala. I am told
that Innamincka” is abo. for “White >
grave.” If so, it has failed to live up W
reputation on this occasion, as no lives w lS
lost when the cyclone, which has been raein
up north like a demented fiend, bumped th
vessel inland.
Yance Jones, of the Commercial Bank of
Australia, is bound for Japan. He will
early next month, and on arrival at Yoko
hama and other important places in Nippon"
will be shown over the city and harbor works
and permitted to camp under the forts and
take soundings and tracings and have a good
time generally. That is, if there’s anvthim,
in reciprocity, he will.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
From a Northern professional man:
Queensland’s immigration system has degenerated’
into a fraud and snare—a fraud mostly. I ami
told on high authority of immigrants who
have died of consumption within six weeks
of their arrival in Brisbane, and of others
who have gone to fill Diamantina and Dalby and
Stanthorpe sanatoriums. To-day I found a consumn
trve immigrant, who had already been at Dalbv and
Diamantina sanatoriums, and is now advised in
again shut herself up in one of these institutions «

Pemberton Ellibtt Walcott, Queensland’s,
new federal Public Service inspector, is 44.
years of age, and has been connected with
the administration of the Public Service ever
since the Commonwealth was born. Prior to
that he toiled in the Brisbane postal service
He has guided the steps of three previous in-
spectors—Bourne (retired), Ilealy (dead)
and Skewes (transferred to Melb.) —and has
done it so well that he now takes up the-
reins himself. Incidentally,, he gets a rise of,'
£340 per annum.
“Boswell” from Brisbane :
J h ° _ the Hi ff h Court recently counted the'
JN.b.W. influx of Criminals Act out on appeal, be-
cause one State has no power to leg:slate against
the citizens of another State, a similar Act is in full
blast in Queensland, and men are still being lassooedii
and convicted under it. A prisoner at St. Helena;
who had been hunted' down under this Dog Act or
whatever it is called;, the other, day got his chance
and assaulted the arresting “demon” as he was stroll-
ing through the. workshops. For this the man was
pulled up before, the gaoli beaks and sentenced, in
camera, to 12 months’ extra, without any pretence of
publicity. But 1 don’t expect the Denham Govern-
ment, which lives,- mostly by the policeman’s trun-
cheon, to right such abuses. Hitherto, its legisla-
tion has been largely directed towards protecting
Commissioner Cahill from some imaginary doom. At
present that official is the onlv one of his species
under the protection of a special Act. For that rea-
son he may yet be known as “Pelorus Jack.”
“Condamine”: “Don Q.” (9./l/’l3) nfi s .
states the case when he says that the land-
owner in Queensland can do as he likes with
his prickly pear. All land selected in the
last few years carries an obligation to dis-
perse the vegetable. One thing that cer-
tainly should be done is to penalise holders
of clean country if they allow the pear
to encroach. On the western line, paddocks
that were clean three years ago are well
carpeted now. In most cases the owner
lives away, and lets the ground to a tenant.
The magnitude of the problem of eradication
mav be judged from this. There are large
areas, over 50 miles from present settle-
ments on the Moonie, for instance—where
even a wild pig cannot penetrate. A scheme
of _ eradication that has every appearance of
being It is now being tried at Dullacca,
where a Yankee chemist named Roberts has
succeeded in applying a gas that has been
proved able to kill the leaves and branches,
though its effect on the main stem and bulb
is not yet known.

ing inquiry is directed, viz.: An inquiry whether
Charles Ernest Hippisley, named in the will of Robert
Townsend Hippisley, is living or dead, and, if dead,
when he died, and whether he left any and what will,
and whether he was ever married, and if so when and

said marriage, and who are his legal personal repre-
sentatives.

Here is a
Proposition
The Melotte
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of the
average cream
separator.
The
Result
The Melotte
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies in the fact that
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best
cream and butter
throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum,
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot the ear
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
horn deaf, we
cannot pretend - ■
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order forrn below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

An Interesting
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half ” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.
Dr. B. Allen’s (u.s.a.>
Mexican
Walnut Stain
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,

able for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR specialists.
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
| lam not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
1 had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of,, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip,,l fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

Dentistry has conferred an enormous blessing upon
the Australian people. To no profession have they
greater reason to show gratitude. Look about you
and you will find there are few indeed in this coun-
try who do not own increased comfort at meals,
better digestions, better looks, and better health
generally, to the much-abused dentist.
—Speech at a Melb. Dentists’ Conference.
Somebody in the U.S. Treasury has invented a
sort of whizzing, light-fingered laundry appliance
which, within the space of 2 i minutes, souses,
wrings and irons paper money, and ejects it in a
perfectly clean and crisp condition for re-issue to
the public. The Treasury, which formerly fur-
naced the precious rubbish, reckons the machine
will save it a million dollars a year. The uom-
monwealth Treasury might profitably interest itself
in the device, and decree frequent washings for all
the notes that pass in over the bank counters. The
insanitary rags that are doled out by Australian
tellers are enough to make a dosser shudder. And
yet clean people have to accept them and
possibly infect tneir clothes by carrying tiiem rounu.
So used are the public to this dog’s-eared money that
the occasional crisp new note is regarded by most
with suspicion, and diagnosed by the inexperienced
as a neat advertisement for a picture show or
patent medicine. *
“John Shearer’’: Mr. C. J. Hutton (B. 16/1/’l3),
talking for ;his co., belts the pig-growers’ co-opera-
tive efforts, and says that the private co. is the pro-
ducers’ real friend. To help prove his case he men-
tions that during August his co. paid Vic. farmers
7.72 d. per lb. dressed weight. I’m glad to hear it.
Unfortunately I’m not a Victorian, but a Queensland
grower, and know that during the first week in
August, at Nambour, when the J. O. Hutton Prop,
was the only buyer in the yards, the porkers were
bought on the basis of 3£d. per lb. dressed weight.
Ditto at Landsborough. Incidentally, if you’ll turn
up the Commonwealth Year Book, you’ll see, under
the heading “Pig and Bacon Industry,” Mr. Knibbs
alleges that in Queensland, “allowing for a trading
capital equal to the amount invested in machinery,
plants, etc., the interest return [of the ham-and
baeon-curers] is 74 per cent, on £126,664.” In
N.S.W. the interest return is 20 per cent, on
£126,323. In N.S.W. the Byron Bay and other co-
operative concerns have gone into the ham- and
bacon-curing business very largely. Private Enter-
prise does nearly all of it in Queensland. Who is
the “real friend” of the producer—the manufacturer
who makes 74 per cent, out of the producer’s raw
material or the one who pays so good a price that
there remains only 20 per cent, for profit and de-
preciation?
* * * *
The readiness of the confidence worker in seizing
an opening is demonstrated in the case of Merrin
versus Corcoran and another, which arises out of the
misfortunes of an affectionate tinsmith of South Mel-
bourne, who made himself acquainted with a nice
girl named Jervis while mixed bathing. It was a
case of love on sight, and a brief courtship was fol-
lowed by a sudden engagement. Then Milly’s duties
as nursemaid with a peripatetic family took her to
Ballarat for a time. During her temporary absence,
Merrin, the susceptible tinsmith, was waited upon
by a stout, distressed, middle-aged person, who ex-
plained that she was Milly’s mother in urgent need
of £2. The gallant Merrin supplied the poor
woman’s need, and next day a portly male stranger
called in a state of mental agony, and said he was
Milly’s father. He wanted £3 to save the old home.
He got it. Within the week the anguished female
was back in tears and tribulation. It appeared that
Milly’s poor father, in a burst of impetuosity accel-
erated by beer, had done damage to a policeman, and
£5 was wanted to bail him out. Merrin, wishing
to do his best for all parties, provided the fiver. There
were two smaller demands after that, but Milly has
now returned, with an assurance that she has no
parents, and lias had none for many years ; and one
Corcoran and another are wanted to explain matters.
That somebody has reduced broaching to a fine art
is evidenced bv the rows that have been proceeding
in Adelaide and Melbourne over the cargo of the s.s.
Beltana. The thieves seem to be the most easy-
going, leisurely workers in existence. Not only are
cases of softgoods, furs, razors, etc., opened and
emptied, but when the contents have been removed,
the packing is replaced and the cases fastened down
again so methodically that experienced carters and
expert packers can detect nothing wrong. A case
of silverware and another of furs, for example, were
shipped in London. On reaching Melbourne the
cautious carter noticed one nail missing from its
place, and refused to accept delivery. That ease
contained only waste paper. The silverware case
showed absolutely no mark of tools, yet all it con-
tained was a couple of ladies’ hats, evidently from
some softgoods consignment. Four silvered vases
were found in a case that ought to have held nothing
but drapery. Besides the mystery of how a gang of
thieves finds time and opportunity to ovehaul cargo in
this thorough fashion, another problem arises—how
do they get the goods ashore? £l5O worth of furs
can’t be stowed in the coat pocket; neither can a
man hump 2cwt. of razors with ease.

Maoriland is to have a cut-in at the French meat
trade. French law is peculiar in that it requires
heart, lungs and liver to be left in the carcase. A
number of mutton growers in Hawkes Bay and the
South Island have combined to supply a consignment
dressed as required, and the frozen flesh will get
forward on its journey next March.

One of the funniest and not the least business-like
of a hundred and one books of snippings that have
issued from Cole’s Book Arcade (Melb.) is entitled
“Mother.” A portrait of E. W. Cole at the age of
81 is the frontispiece. The genial old identity calls
himself the “editor,” and he dedicates the volume
“to the Memory of his Mother, in gratitude for all
her loving care.” The first of the texts which the
purveyor of maudlin sentiment dedicates to the
memory of his long-lost parent is “A mother’s love is
best of all (West African),” and, for the rest, the
book is a collection of paragraphs, exclamations,
verses and storiettes with mother for their subject
every time. A number of old woodcut illustrations
of mother in all her phases are really interesting.
Most of them date back to the age of crinolines, and
the picture of a hooped mother saying “Goo-goo” to a
very old-fashioned infant is enough to make even
eugels weep.
One time I lived in some content—
I ran a boarding house at Kew.
My humble boarders came and went,
And all were glad to feed on stew.
I would the dogs were ’neath the loam
Who cursed my house and wrecked my home!
The boarders whom I lodged at Kew
Had teeth it was not safe to gnash.
They had to eat what they could chew,
And very partial were to hash.
I gave them hash, I stewed them plums,
And aye was careful of their gums.
With teeth of bone and teeth of gold
They’ve given diners courage new
On tough bull-meat to take a hold,
And tear the stout rump-steak in two.
Then meat went up, but sorrow’s crown
Was in the way the meat went down.
The empty mouths of all the crew
That gathered at my table-side
They filled with grinders hard and true
To tear the chicken bone and hide.
Instead of grace, with phrases rude
I cried for mercy on the food.
Too clean they picked my wretched bones,
My substance they devoured all day.
I sit here on the wayside stones,
A withered creature, and I pray
That they may taste the Devil’s brew
Who turned the boarder’s soul from stew.

Thousands of women are to-day the pos-
sessors of beautiful busts and perfect forms
as the result of an accidental discovery made
more than two years ago by Madame Mar-
garette Merlain, whose fame has now spread
to nearly every part of the world. While
taking a new prescription for building up her
health, Madame Merlain suddenly noticed
that her bust was growing from almost
nothing to a very large size; in fact, her bust
measure increased six inches in 30 days.
Physicians and chemists to whom the mat-
ter was reported arranged to try the new
treatment she had used on ten other women
without busts. The results obtained within
a few days truly astonished the sages of
medicine and science, and in a few weeks
each of the ten women had obtained a most
marvellous enlargement of the bust. Next
it was tried on 50 women without busts, and
the same marvellous enlargement was ob-
tained.
Madame Merlain is herself a living ex-
ample of the great power of her remarkable
discovery. By many she is considered to
have the most beautiful bust and most perfect
form of any woman in Europe. But best of
all this wonderful discovery not only suc-
ceeded in her own case and in those where
special tests were made, but it seems to
have worked even more astonishing results
in the cases of others, even after ordinary
pills, massage, wooden cups and various ad-
vertised preparations had all been tried with-
out the slightest results.
Miss Helen Marion Buckett, of 166
Cholmeley Road, Reading, writes: —
“Since using the Venus-Carnis treatment my
bust has developed in all four inches, an
improvement for which • I am extremely
thankful.”
Madame de Zisbrovsky, of Paris,
says:—“My bust was flat and soft, hnd
thanks to your marvellous treatment, I now
have a bust, firm and well-developed, which
is the admiration of all. I am all the more
grateful to you as I had already tried several
other remedies, which had all been without
the least results.”
Madame Dixon, of Cannes, says : —“The
great hollows in my neck, which were my
despair, have completely disappeared. My
bust has become firm and considerably larger,
and I am now able to low-necked gowns
without shame and humiliation.”
Mrs. McGee, of Colwyn Bay, Wales,
says:—“My breasts, which were a short time
ago quite flat and undeveloped, are now, I
am proud to say, round and just as large and
firm as I desire to have them. I also feel
much brighter and better than before.”
Madame Districh, of Leipzig, Ger-
many, writes : —“I am entirely satisfied,
and I never imagined that such results would
be possible, because for several years I have
been ill, and was constantly following treat-
ments of one kind or another. I have not
only obtained a beautifully curved form
and firm flesh, but my general health has
been greatly improved.”
Dr. Colonnay, of the Faculty of Medi-
cine of Paris, declares: —“No matter
whether a woman be young or old, nor what
her condition of health may be, I firmly
believe that in the Venus-Carnis treatment
she has an infallible method for developing
and beautifying her bust.”
Dr. Domenico Bcuncio, of Prata San-
nita, Italy, states: —“I beg to confirm my
previous letters concerning the Venus-Carnis
treatment, and I have pleasure in informing
you that my patent has used this treatment
and is very satisfied with the really marvel-
lous results that she has obtained. I can
therefore conscientiously state that this
treatment is excellent, and that it . can .in
no way be compared to others of its kind
claiming to give the same results.”
There are hundreds of just such state-
ments as the above on file in my office, as
well as actual photographs taken one njonth
apart, before and after the use of this re-
markable treatment. You could see them
for yourself, but as you cannot call, I will

ILIOUSNESS
BODY RACKED BY RETCHING 8 CHEST PAINS.
SUFFERED 5 YEARS-OTHER REMEDIES USELESS
ONVINCING testimony to the wonderful cura-
tive virtues of Bile Beans is that of Mrs.
A. Nicholson, of 50 Campbell Street, Glebe,
Sydney, who says:—“For over five years I
was a great sufferer from violent bilious attacks,
indigestion and severe headaches. Awful pains
between the shoulders and in the chest tortured
me, and my appetite disappeared. Terrible fits
of retching weakened me, and my liver became
sluggish, and 1 felt weary and had no desire for
work. Although I tried many remedies for my
troubles, nothing gave me permanent relief, for
the attacks became more violent and frequent.
“I had read a good deal about Bile Beans, and
when a friend recommended them 1 obtained a
supply and commenced taking them. After the
first few doses I was convinced that Bile Beans
would cure me, for the headaches and pains be-
came less violent, and my appetite mended. 1
persevered with Bile Beans until my digestive
organs were strengthened and stimulated to their
proper action, all my troubles were ended, and 1
felt brighter and stronger. Bile Beans made me
completely better.
“ Now we always keep a supply of Bile Beans
in the house, for they are unrivalled as a general
corrective and as a remedy for ailments arising
through errors in diet.”
The Standard Family Medicine
Bile Beans are unequalled for
headache, indigestion, constipa-
tion, biliousness, bad breath, de-
bility, that tired feel-
ing, dizziness, lassi-
tude, lack of energy,

The Grey Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T T’S the steady man’s the good man,”
I my mither said to me;
’Twas the good man, the grey man,
my mither picked for me—
Snug cot on the loaning, an’ kine an’ chicks
and corn,
The mellow glow o’ sunset instead o’ wild
red morn.
“Steady man and staunch man,” my mither
said to me —
Burn betwixt the level braes, an’ no’ the
open sea!
Peat an’ coal the fire feeds (some hae only
Glass-pane in our window frame, an’ meat
an’ a’ to eat —
Silk gown for my Sunday wear, a feather in
my hat —
Pit-brow wench an’ farmer’s lass a’ can envy
that.
“Man wi’ siller in the pouch, that’s the ane
for thee;
Steady man an’ grey man,” my mither said
to me.
In the long June gloaming the moths go
breathing by—
Feathers dropt from angels’ wings on a
golden sky;
And in all the farm lands up among the
wheat
Button-bright the poppies grow, warm and
drowsy-sweet.
Turning o’ the stocking-heel (while the lads
again
Are hand-fasted with the girls in the bow-
ery lane) —•
Silly thoughts a wife to have, wi’ her own
good house
Fast as bee in clover bed, or in grain a
mouse.
Oh, the moth has drifting wings, an’ the
moths are free!
“The grey man’s the good man” — and that
is a’ for me!
Green salt pools a-glimmer, little wrinkling
waves,
Honey-colored moonlight, where the grey
tide laves;
Beaches white a-shimmer, white an’ wild an’
wet;
Rainbows o’ the foam spray whiles I can’t
forget!
Butterflies in daisy fields, gulls across the
sea....
The four walls, the swept hearth, the grey
man for me!
Winter, when the earth outside, white as
dead maid’s breast,
Lifts the hummocks of the snow to the
frozen west;
Bubbling gases in the slack, gay as young
desire,
So I see two bonnie eyes blazing in the
fire;
Hair as black as broken coal, lips as red an'
fine....
And a ghost creeps from the ash, burns a
kiss on mine.
Sits an’ nods my own good man, ’neath his
grey roof tree;
Sleep wi’out a stir for him — an' the dreams
for me!
“It’s the steady man’s the good man,” my
mither said to me;
That’s the good man, the grey man, my
mither picked for me;
Snug cot on the loaning, an’ kine an’ chicks
an’ corn,
The mellow glow o’ sunset against a wild
red morn.
“Steady man an’ staunch man,” my mither
said to me —
Burn betwixt the level banks.... out, ah
....the wide....wide sea!

M. FORREST.
A Set of Furs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. TRIBBENS’S boarders were
distributed about the verandah after
the Saturday mid-day dinner, when
word was passed along that disim-
guished-looking stranger in the top hat anu
frock coat, who had just passed up the
street, had returned and was making tor
the front gate. All conversation ceased as
he walked slowly up the steps and rang the
bell. Mrs. Tribbens herself answered it and
seemed puzzled at his first question. Ihen
she gave a perceptible start of recollection
and hurriedly asked him to step inside, tn a
few minutes, she reappeared alone on the
verandah. , , , ,
“What is it, Mrs. Tribbens? they pleaded
in whispers. , ,
The landlady looked about her nervously.
“He’s a lawyer, and he’s come to see Alice,
the maid.” ~
“Alice!” they chorused blankly. What
on earth for?” , , ,
“I don’t know. But he says he has good
news for her, so I expect it must be money.
Looks both envious and incredulous were
exchanged. “Money! Just fancy.
“Some people do have luck !” drearily mur-
mured Miss Gummer, the Post-Office girl.
She and her fiance, Mr. were tnen
scraping and saving in anticipation of the
manifold expenses of matrimony, and heie
money was simply showering on the mai ,
who already possessed a decent banki 0
account. ..
A few minutes passed, and then all weii
startled by peals of loud laughter from ie
sacred drawing-room. “Juft listen to t a
girl!” cried the women. Whatever will t
lawyer think of her?” , „ fVI „
They were shocked later on when the
giggling maid emerged from the ball entrance
with the abashed visitor, and brightly waved
him off the premises with a friendly, We ,
ta-ta for th’ present. Be good. ,
As soon as the top-hatted one had escaped
they crowded round the lucky girl,
started to congratulate her in a P at ™uising
way. “You must be glad! thev moaned.
“How perfectly wonderful to come into all
that money!” , ..
Alice laughed at them happily. >
ain’t so much —a matter of six undred an
twenty punds.”
“Oh, how lovely!” „ „
“Yes,” continued the happy savage care
lesssly, “it ain’t so bad, but it ain t
prise. It’s from me uncle s estate—l knoo
it was coinin’ some time.”
\Vhy, you're quite a rich girl now! You
wont work any more, will you?” cried poor
Miss Uummer.
“Why, o’ course I will, Miss Gum’r! 1
aia ’t, enou sh to stop workin’, and, !
what s more, 1 wouldn’t leave Mrs. Tribbens j
not fer worlds! She’s been like a mother to
me, an’ besides, I wouldn’t know what to do
with meself, any’ow.”
There was some subdued applause at this;
but it didn’t exactly fire the enthusiasm of
her female listeners.
“If 1 came in to some money,” announced
a bleak spinster freezingly, “I would go for
a trip round the word and Broaden My
Mind!”
This speech was applauded to the echo.
Alice, the practical, wiped her hands on
her apron. “Aw, I’ll just put it in the
bank for a bit, till I make up me mind.
I’m all muddled-like just now—-don’t seem
to know what I’m doin’, what with the
fuss an’ all. Money’s rotten in a way—wor-
ries you an’ brings sorrer, I think. I don’t
know anythin’ about ’vestments, and shares,
an’ such; an’ propperty’s nothin’ but payin’
rates, an’ gettin’ the drains seen to, an arf
the time the people won’t pay up. I’ll just
leave it in the bank fer a bit.” Having sad-
dened herself with these reflections, she re-
turned to her kitchen and left the idle women
to wear the subject to rags.
The eminent Mr. Bodger, senior male
boarder of the establishment, encountered
the excited gossips on his way in to tea, and
was immediately bailed up and overwhelmed
with full particulars of the legacy. After
considering the six different accounts, he ex-
pressed his unbounded admiration of Alice’s
prudence, and undertook to give her the bene-
fit of his ripe experience. “I always liked
that girl,” he concluded ponderously. “No
fal-lals or foolery about her at all. She’s
too smart to throw away the money 7 on trips
or dresses. She’s got a good head —knows
her proper place, and doesn’t want to leave
it. Damme, I wish all women were as sen-
sible !” As usual, he left his female audi-
ence somewhat annoved. Bodger’s down-
right style was apt to be disconcerting.
After the evening meal, Mrs. Dodd-Gar-
stead, a vitriolic, overdressed woman who
spent all her life grading the world and prov-
ing conclusively that one-half of it wasn’t
fit to black the other half’s boots, expressed
it as her firm opinion that the girl should
be instantly discharged, as she would not
now be worth her salt as a servant. Money,
she explained, always had that effect on the
lower classes. Anyhow, it was intolerable
that, while one had to scrape and save, the
servant was simply reeking . of money, and
must be sneering and laughing behind one s
back. It was too idiotic altogether—the
Law should see to it that money went to
the gentlefolk who knew how to use it, not
to servant girls who were only fit to wash
up dishes and make beds.
After this outburst, the boarders on the
verandah were silent for a space. Bodger,
who had listened to it in stunned silence,
was clearing his throat preparatory to de-
fending the good sense of Alice, when a
giggling female courier arrived with the
news that the lucky one was now talking
wildly about Paris over the washing-up tin,
and threatening to get' into the best society
and go to balls and receptions every night
of her life. There was a burst of malicious
laughter, and Bodger sank back in his deck
chair and fell to gloomily stroking his beard.
“What did I tell you?” snapped Mrs.
Dodd-Garstead. „ ,
“If I had that money,” began Mr. Dadclip
thoughtfully, “I would buy a nice little. place
within handv distance of town and go in for
poultry.” He unfolded his scheme at great
length, and showed that there would be
heaps of money in it. It was a rather good
round game, and they each took a hand in
it with more or less success. By the time
they had quite finished, someone else ar-
rived with the intelligence . that Alice was
now talking severely of giving it all to the
church, because she wanted to do a bit ot
good in her life, and what was the use of
going to Gay Faree if you couldn t talk the
language and didn’t know how to be gay like
the rest! _,
Whilst Mrs. Dodd-Garstead was working
off the rage generated by this communication,
Bodger heaved himself out of his chair and
went off, rudely grunting something to the
effect that no confounded woman was nt
to be trusted with a penny piece.
And all this time, Lempson and Miss
Gummer, whose wedding-day was now in
sight and who were, consequently, very ner-
vous and worried about many things, especi-
Illy furniture and finance, were wretched y
calculating if, by any chance, Alice would
consider a proposition to build them a small
cottage and let them pay it off as rent.
They agreed that it would be a splendid
investmlnt for her ; but neither of them
could bear to broach the subject to the only
capitalist m the house.
During the next three days, Alice got more
inexpert advice about the investment of her
money than a shipload of heiresses could have
absorbed. She was implored to start tea
rooms, poultry farms, lolly shops,, boarding-
houses. boatsheds, hatshops, manicure pa
fors, registry offices, toy shops, news agen-
cies billiard saloons, boatsheds and other
enterprises. Mr. Dadclip grimly estimated
that she would require £75.000 capital to fol
to all this advice
used up a Rood deal ot her working time,
and usually, when she escaped from some
financial genius to the kitchen it was oMy
to reject the heart and hand and horse ana
cart of some love-lorn tradesman. Ihe
butcher was repelled the first day; and being
„ full blooded man, used to having his own
wav he ever afterwards dashed the meat
down on the kitchen table in a. wild and
desnerate fashion. The other kitchen-door
callers went down one after the other. and
anon there was no lausrhter or chaff to be
heard round the back. The only one who_re-
tained his eood spirits was the milkman a
nrofessed bigamist, who was prepared to
do anything for money except commit matri-
m Then Parman. one of the young-men
lodaers. made a determined attempt to bor i
rnw £5O and, the fact becoming.known, wa.
roasted whole several times by the censorious
members of the household* + n
And at last, when everyone was mentally
exhausted through the efforts to spend her
ndonev for her, Alice gleefully broke the news
tW she had spent every penny of it on a
600-guinea set of ermine furs .

URIC ACID DANGERS
rv
" Every
picture
tells a
ntory."
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle (6 bottles
15/3), or post free on receipt of
price from Foster-McClellan Co.,
70 Pitt Street, Sy'ney.
Some poisons warn you with a sudden smarting - pain and violent sickness.
Not so uric acid for uric acid poisoning - is slow and deceptive. It may go on in the
system foi years without the patient realising his danger —that is why it is so serious, and why it
causes more suffering and disease than any other poison.
There is always a certain amount of uric acid getting into the blood, but we have nothing
to fear from it so long as the kidneys are active, for healthy kidneys filter this dangerous poison
out of the blood and dispose of it with the waste water, through the bladder. That is the great
work of the kidneys—to keep the blood pure.
But when the kidneys get weakened by a cold, overwork, stooping about, working in
diaughts or extreme heat, or excesses of any kind, they cannot filter the uric acid out of the
blood. That is how most dangerous diseases begin.
. You may not notice anything the matter at first, except a drowsy, heavy and oppressed feeling, an occasional dull
ache m the back, and the necessity of emptying the bladder more often than usual. At this stage a few doses of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will generally remove all traces of uric acid poison and kidney weakness. But later on, when the
uric acid gets settled in the system and causes lumbago, rheumatism, sciatica, sharp pains in the loins and back, gravel,
urinary obstruction, inflammation of the bladder, and the swellings of dropsy, a thorough course of Doan’s Pills may be
necessary before the uric acid is disposed of and the kidneys are restored to health.
]) °ans Backache Kidney Pills promote a free flow from the urinary system ; this dislodges the uric acid crystals
and flushes them out, and releases the accumulated water in dropsy.

SYDNEY TESTIMONY.

Backache
Kidney
The shocking announcement —-it was made
at dinner—instantly put a stop to all eating.
Knives and forks fell with a clatter that
suggested a beaten regiment laying down its
arms.
The first coherent exclamation came from
Bodger. It was a deep and heartfelt “Good
God!” —the cry of a strong man who
had just received his death-blow.
Miss Gnmmer, tired and fretted with end-
less arguments and calculations, shrieked
faintly and dabbed at her lips with a small
handkerchief.
Lempson, the bridegroom-elect, went pale
and nodded his head hopelessly.
Mrs. Tribbens fanned herself weakly with
the tea cosy.
Mr. Dadclip, the poultry enthusiast,
settled his glasses on lxis nose and looked
wildly about him.
But Mrs. Dodd-Garstead was the hardest
hit of all. When she realised the full signi-
ficance of the grinning maid’s news, she
rose slowly from her chair and gasped, “How
dare you ! The idea of you —a servant —
darinp to buy such furs —things that only
ladies should wear! Oh, how dare you!
You ought to he thoroughly ashamed of your-
self. You don’t know your place ! I—l. . . .
Oil, I can’t bear it!” And she fell back in
her chair, and, leaning her elbows on the
table, supported her distorted face in her
hands, while she wept with the greatest pos-
sible enthusiasm into the remains of her
pudding.
Within a week Alice was the chief amuse-
ment of the suburb, then in the throes of a
dull summer. Whenever ordered out on an
emergency errand, she would say archly, “I
think I'll just go and put on me furs !” And
she would, no matter how murderously hot
the day. Some of the remarks wrung from
Mrs. Dodd-Garstead by these bear-like forag-
ing excursions into the blazing heat were
classics in their unpleasant way.
Then Alice achieved fame easily by faint-
ing one morning in the street whilst hurry-
ing home with a parcel of sausages, and
being borne tenderly to the hospital in a pass-
ing motor. A Sunday paper got hold of the
story of the Girl in Ermine, and with photo-
graphy made an interesting four columns of
it. Alice’s full history was set forth, and she
was honorably bracketed with a leading
musical-comedy actress as the owner of the
best furs in Sydney. Felicity brought her
all sorts of friends and enemies. Artistic,
comfort-loving people praised her for her ap-
preciation of the nice things of life; clerics
denounced her from their pulpits for her
dangerous love of luxury. Some charitable
people were furious with her for spending all
the legacy on herself; a lot of uncharitable
folk said she never had a legacy. Amongst
the latter class was Mrs. Dodd-Garstead,
who, such was her rage and envy, heroicallv
disregarded all the circumstantial evidence
and bluntly intimated that she knew the girl
was no better than she should be. She
seemed almost unable to control herself when
the Most Talked-of Maid in Sydney r>p-
proached; and when that paragraphed
female hurriedly retreated, her manner sug-
gested that it was as much as she could do
to keep from pursuing her and doing her a
deadly injury. All day long she watched
Alices comings and goings like a cat, and
snarled over them to the exclusion of every
other subject. The set of furs was wearing
her out body and soul, and all hands grew
apprehensive. Alice herself tottered to and
fro, wearing the look of one who waits for a
typhoon to break. The snowy, black-tailed
splendor had become a curse.
There was exactly two weeks and three
days of this sort of thing before the tragedy
happened.
It was just before tea, when Alice was
busy with the table, preparations, that Mrs.
Dodd-Garstead ran in from the yard, shriek-
ing that the house was on fire. The dining-
room rose as one boarder and ran to make
sure she wasn’t lying again. It was quite
true. . Smoke was pouring from the window
of Alice’s room, and the flicker of flames
could be seen through the glass.
As luck would have it, Lempson had been
lazy, as usual, and had left the garden hose
screwed on to the tap, instead of uncoupling
it and putting it away. The ladder, too, was
lying handy ; so it didn’t take him long to
climb up and get a stream playing on the
fire. A quarter of an hour later the house
was safe, but Alice’s room was a charred
and evil-smelling den.
Mrs. Dodd-Garstead, very bright-eyed and
flushed, hovered on the outskirts of the
stunned crowd, murmuring consoling tilings
and giving, on the whole, a very fair imita-
tion of a sympathetic woman, shocked by an
overwhelming catastrophe.
White-faced Alice flew upstairs as soon as
the fire was out to assess the damages.
When she came down, after five minutes’ ab-
sence, Mrs. Dodd-Garstead was the very first
to approach her. “Your coat, dear,” she
cooed, “is it really burnt?”
Bodger. in the background, grasped his
beard and stared hard at the back of her
neck.
The stricken Alice seemed genuinely
touched by this exhibition of sympathy.
“Yes’m,” she panted rueful]v, “it’s burnt orl
right—burnt all to cinders !”
“Oh, you poor thing!”
Alice nodded, misty-eyed. “I dunno! T
’spose it wuz a judgment on me for wantin’
to go to Paree an’ be a gay. Ah. well! I
won’t buy no. more furs when I get me
money from th’ ’nsuranee company.”
Mrs. Dodd-Garstead fell back two steps;
her jaw fell about two feet. “Do you mean
to say !”
“Yes, mum. Wasn’t it lucky!”
Mrs. Dodd-Garstead expressed her delight
by rushing straight up to her room and hav-
ing violent hysterics. When she had quite
done, Mrs. Tribbens, attended by Messrs.
Bodger and Dempson, A.D.C.’s, waited on
her and presented an ultimatum, in as digni-
fied a manner as possible, through the key-
hole. She and her husband were to be out
of the house by eight o’clock, and a cheque
for the damage would be required witliiu a
week.
Then they descended solemnly to a band
of boarders oppressed with a sense of dis-
aster and the outrageous odor of burnt cloth-
ing. Dinner was taken in funereal silence,
and, until someone told her to stop, simple
Alice kept on moaning in a dazed way, “Pore
thing! Didn’t she take it to ’art? Funny*
’ow things turn out. Y’ know, I used to
think she didn’t like me wearin’ it. Pore
thing!”
KODAK.
Smithers and O’Regan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O’REGAN was a fine stalwart son of
Ireland who had been sentenced for
his sins to teach the country school
at Jones’s Pocket. An out-and-out patriot
was O’Regan—a staunch Home Ruler, a
whole-souled hater of the Sassenach and a
sworn foe to the Black North. Inspector
O’Hara, who used to examine the schools in
O’Regan’s district, was of precisely the
same brand of political opinion as O’Regan
himself. If you passed O’Regan’s school
on the day when his,pupils were instructed
in singing, and you chanced to look in,
O’Regan would promptly greet you in his
heartiest fashion, and, turning to his
pupils, would remark: “Now, bhoys and
girls, give Mister Blank a taste of your
quality.”
Proudly the note of the pibroch is sounding.
And the children of Jones’s Pocket would
roll out “O'Donnell Aboo!” with a fervor
that would carry you back hundreds of
years to the days when O’Donnell was a
name that made the Sassenach soldiery
shake in their shoes and wish themselves
the other side of the Channel. When the
last echoes of “O’Donnell Aboo” had died
down, O’Regan would lift his baton again,
and the song-birds of Jones’s Pocket would
regale the visitor with that plaintive
strain, “The Wearing of the Green.” Other
ditties of Celtic origin were in O’Regan’s
repertoire, but “O’Donnell Aboo” and
“The Wearing of the Green” you could
strike without fail every time.
About three miles from Jones’s rocket
stood the school belonging to Fig Tree
Scrub. Although so near one another, the
two were in different inspectorial dis-
tricts. Reginald Smithers, the Fig Tree
Scrub pedagogue, was also a patriot,
though of a different brand —a Jingo of the
deepest dye, who had resolved to imbue the
district with his sentiments. With the very
noblest of motives, of course, Smithers had
introduced into his school such melodies as
“Rule Britannia,” “Sons of the Sea,” “The
British Grenadiers,” the which ditties were
sung and re-sung until the very dogs that
ran about the school-ground nosing for a
casual crust could almost give you in a
nasal howl, “Some tork ov Alexander,” or
“Sons orv the Sea!”
Inspector Robinson, who presided over
Smithers’ district, cherished a most in-
tense admiration for “Rule Britannia,” and
thought that “Sons of the Sea” was the
finest musical composition of modern times.
Not that this fact had the slightest weight
with Smithers —not for a moment. If
Robinson thought that the verse running
But yer can’t beat the boys orv the bulldog breed
That made hold England’s name,
was the finest poetical outburst since By-
ron’s day, who was Smithers that he should
deny Inspector Robinson the luxury of oc-
casionally listening to the spirited anthem’
Incidentally, O’Regan and Smithers re-
ceived magnificent reports from their respec-
tive inspectors, with particularly compli-
mentary remarks about the singing.
Quite suddenly, and without giving anv
notice of the change, the Education De-
partment rearranged the boundaries of the
districts of Inspectors Robinson and
O’Hara, with the result that one June
morning Inspector Robinson walked quietly
into O’Regan’s school and set to work on his
annual examination. At the close of his
operations he requested the teacher to put
the pupils through a song or two, and in
five minutes was listening dazed and horri-
fied to that fierce anti-Sassenach battle-
hymn, “O’Donnell Aboo.” One touch of
the spirited Celtic chorus was enough for
Robinson.
“But. Mr. O’Hara, have they no other
song?”
“Certainly, sir,” said O’Regan proudly,
and forthwith the youngsters pealed out:—
Oil, the Wearin’ ov the Green,
The Wearin’ ov the Green,
They’re hangin’ men and women for the Wearin’ ov
the Green !
Robinson seized his hat and fled.
A week or two later Inspector O’Hara
dropped in on Smithers. Smithers was
somewhat taken aback. He, like O’Regan,
knew nothing of the Departmental re-
arrangement that had taken away his
ultra-jingoistic superior, and saddled him
with an enthusiastic Home-Ruler. Conse-
quently, he had no new musical treat to
offer when O’Hara demanded a song or two.
Tip rose, naturally, the strains of “Rule
Britannia”: and when O’Hara requested a
change in the bill of fare, Smithers shunted
off on to “Sons of the Sea” —
'Ave you ’card the tale of forrin nashuns
Buildin’ ships unceasinTy?
O’Hara nearly burst with disgust, and sig-
nalled Smithers to stop the performance;
but the youngsters went gallantly on:—
Sons orv the Sea,
Orl British born :
But yer can’t beat ther boys orv the bulldawg breed
That made hold England's name.
The Inspector had to listen through to the
bitter end. Then he also fled.
A month or two later O’Regan had the
pleasure of reading the annual report of
Inspector Robinson on his establishment
and its progress :
The tone of the school in Jones's Pocket is not what
it might be. The Union Jack is seldom hoisted and
saluted as it ought to be, and the songs taught are
highly unsuitable, and not calculated to foster a spirit
of patriotism. The teacher’s ear for music appears
to be very faulty, and the children’s disposition to
bawl in singing a chorus is very noticeable.
A similar document from Inspector
O'Hara struck Smithers one morning:—
Much fervor and vigor are evident in the singing of
the pupils, but very little of either melody or har-
mony. The teacher, unfortunately, mistakes political
enthusiasm for correct vocalisation.
The latest rumor from Jones’s Pocket
and Fig Tree Scrub is to the effect that
O’Regan is wrestling in genuine agony of
spirit with “Sons of the Sea,” while
Smithers is busy practising that fine old
Irish melody, “O’Donnell Aboo.”
