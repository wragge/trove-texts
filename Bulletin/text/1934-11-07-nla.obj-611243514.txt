HIS BOOKS
The Week’s Best:-
H. G. WELLS
TELLS HIS
OWN STORY
H. G. Wells
implies in the first
of the two vol-
umes of his Ex-
periment in Auto-
biography that
Australia might easily have had him:
his father twice thought of coming here.
What the Australia he would have
come to might have done with him is
interesting without being important, It
might have given him health —in youth
his lungs were very patchy—and, as the
father played cricket, we could surely
have done something with the son.
A more valuable speculation, because
it has the germ of hope in it, is what a
man of his quality would do with the
Australia that is about us now. For there
is little essential difference between the
time-state of this Australia and the Eng-
land dn which Wells had to make his
struggle. Wells makes much of that
struggle, and well
he might. It was
a terrific thing,
just as it must be
a terrific thing
for even a man
of such quality as
his to escape out
of the environ-
mental rep res-
sions of to-day’s
very similar Aus-
tralia. 'The im-
rtant point is
that, though stu-
pendous, it is not
impossible, to a
Wells.
The story of
that struggle of
his Wells tells

pressively. Pov-

norance and the common revolting
enlightenment; draper’s assistant and
school-teacher ; gradual self-education ;
physical frailty and recurrent illness ; in
the service of journalism and being infin-
itely more served by it. That ends Vol. I
—the story of a man of middle-class
circumstances but of exceptional quality
struggling to escape, making hard going
of it, but seeing it through ; this in an
environment virtually as bankrupt in
cultural integrity as is this marvellous, if
not fabulous, backwater in
which, in this year 1934, such
a book as Aldous Huxley’s
Brave New World is pro-
hibited entry by order of a
customs - house censorship.
This—only one of frequent
acts in the steadily applied
official oppression—does not
represent any extraordinary
access of Puritanism. It is
done with an author, Tom
White, as the Commonwealth
Minister for Customs and
with a Board of Censors ap-
pointed on the strength of
supposed culture ; and it is
possible simply because it
represents the uncultural con-
dition of the body of an
entire people.
ALDINGTON’S
DIP INTO
FEMINISM
An eng aging
variation on
Wells’s theme of
human struggle is
presented by
Richard Alding-
ton in his new novel Women Must Work.
Less savage than Death of a Hero,
though dealing with the England of much
the same period, and less cynical than
The Colonel’s Daughter, it represents a
softening in the author’s outlook upon
humanity.
The struggle with which it deals —
that of feminism just before, during and
since the war —has been presented from
so many angles that as the full theme
for a novel it begins to look hackneyed,
and Aldington really has nothing new to
say about it. The merit of his work is
the completeness with which he has
assembled the parts of his picture, and
in his understanding penetration into the
evolutionary processes by which women
over the last 30 years have struggled
from the status of slaves and goddesses
to the status of natural human beings.
The mechanics of the novel are very
ordinary. The central symbol is a
girl who, about half-way between the be-
ginning of the century and the war
period, feels in herself the breaking
awareness of feminism, escapes from a
worse home environment than Wells’s
own, goes through—being a woman —
an infinitely more difficult struggle
than he had to face, has that essen-
tial piece of luck which Wells, in
his case, fails to give the full credit
it always deserves, tries to fulfil her
sexual requirements by the fashionable
means of the moment —a -temporary
liaison —and emerges in the end a strong,
and hard, commercial success. Under-
lying this general structure is a mild
tilting at futility: the man she could
have had, and wanted, and declined from
sentimental reasons, could have been
hers without her breaking anybody’s
heart at all.
It is hardly a nice sentimental novel,
but Aldington looks well on
the way to producing one.
STUDY OF
A POTENT
ELEMENT
Richard Aldington.
The steps
taken to keep
this country
so culturally
backward that
a Brave New
World is too advanced to be
tolerated and a novel like
Women Must Work would be
a dubious event might be
described by Lord Davies,
the author of Force, as an
abuse of the element he uses
for title and topic of his
arresting treatise.
The work, briefly, is a
study of the operation, and
especially the abuse, of force in
world affairs. Lord Davies has been
heard from this platform before. In
1930 he published The Problem of the
Twentieth Century, which weighed 2£lb.,
and in which he conducted a most mas-
terly and comprehensive inquiry into the
right and wrong use of force in a rela-
tionship with continued world peace. He
then reached the conclusion that, while
hope lay with the League of Nations, the
League without sanction to enforce its
decisions was a poor sort' of joke. Since
then, occurrences in China and elsewhere
would seem to have supported him up to
the hilt; and now, with those occurrences
and the abuses of force in Germany for
backing, he returns to the attack.
His argument, in a nutshell, is this;
Force is a moral element' when used to
ensure justice, and a most immoral ele-
ment when used, as it was used in the
war and is being used more widely
to-day, to establish the ends of policy,
prejudice and passion: in the last resort
it is the element of force which decides
the issue: it is either the servant of jus-
tice or the tool of policy ; and the reign
of law will never be evolved out of the
existing anarchy until the world has
solved the problem of its right use.
It all boils down to argument in favor
of the democratic State and against sup-
pressive dictatorships. Logical and stimu-
lating, the pity of it is its price. If the
intentions of such thinkers as Lord
Davies were fully altruistic, they would
have the cost of such books as low, in-
stead of as high, as possible. They de-
feat themselves for money.

Poet as
Dreamer
In his pious
survey of modern
literature, After
Strange Gods
(Faber and
Faber; 6s. 9d.),
T. S. Eliot advances what may seem to
readers in this country something of a
paradox; he says that in poetry a poet
can be concerned only with actuality,
whereas in prose he may write of
“ideals.” Whether this is absolutely true
or not, this is the main dividing line be-
tween the more important contemporary
poets and the poets up till 1917 (when
Eliot collected “Prufrock”).
Till the Eliot influence was felt, the
poet-in-our-midst was regarded as a
cross between an angel and a fairy, half
to be reverenced, half despised. Some
writers, like Kipling, filled out their lines
with watered oaths to persuade us that
they were real he-men with hair on their
chests; but
writers who
could read the
poetry of Kip-
ling and still
feel dissatisfied
could yet find
nothing else to
write about;
they kept on
vaguely about
sunsets, love
and, in this
country, Our
Heritage (“She
is not yet, but
he whose ear”),
and all this be-
cause the poet
had to dream.
What Eliot did

our language. For the benefit of the
sunset poets he got up the line about
the typist coming home to
Her drying combinations, touched by the
sun’s rays,
and to express niggling futility he wrote
I have measured out my life with coffee
spoons.
In this way he threw open to the Eng-
lish poet the vocabulary of his own lan-
guage, a vocabulary which, at the begin-
ning of this century, was almost as
severely-forbidden to the poet as Italian

PRESS BOOKS HAVE THE BACKING OF “THE BULLETIN”
was before Dante preferred it to Latin.
And he showed, with such phrases as
“The burnt-out ends of smoky days” and
“Shall I spit out the butt-ends of my
days and ways?” that even the cigarette
could be forced into metaphor as in-
tense, profound and precise as the meta-
phor of Shakspeare.
This in itself did not make poetry
more “realistic.” Realism in poetry is
between the lines ; an emotional realism.
Eliot explains elsewhere that the Eliza-
bethans, because they used their lan-
guage freely, were more crude than the
Augustans, but also more precise; so
the new variety of words which Eliot
exploited has made it possible to express
emotions more precise than was possible,
for instance, to Swinburne.
The effect on modern poetry is that
the poet exchanges dreaming for think-
ing. Eliot, on the banks of the Thames,
recalls the great Elizabethan refrain:
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my
song;
then he adds: —
Sweet Thames, run softly, for l sing not
loud nor long,
which is exactly the rhythm of a negro
plantation song, “Poor Old Joe”; by
twisting Spenser into Foster he achieves
emotionally the comment that English
music and all it stands for is modulating
into negroid attitudes, so that the next
lines come naturally:
But at my back in a cold blast / hear
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle
spread from ear to ear.
Whether this greater- variety of words
and directed use of rhythms have made
the poet any more useful to the com-
munity you have only to consult Eliofs
own summing-up in The Use of Poetry
and the Use of Criticism (Faber and
Faber; 11s. 3d.), to find. But there is
no doubt that they make the poet more
interesting in his poetry, because, in-
stead of writing fantasies of what he
feels he should have felt, he is writing
his own experience in (however it may
be intensified) the tone and language of
everyday conversation.
RONALD MCCUAIG.
Did Lawson
Write Lawson?
It is estimated
that more than
1000 books have
been written to
prove that Shaks-
peare did not write Shakspeare.
I have lately waded through a group
of books on the subject and find that the
arguments fall finally into a few simple
categories. It is maintained that Shaks-
peare could not have written the plays
because he was never at a foreign Court,
knew little Latin and less Greek, grew
up in an obscure country town, was a
poor heeler at the feasts of the aristo-
crats, never got a master’s certificate,
had no university degrees, did not prac-
tise as a lawyer, was a bad geographer
and was less learned than the average
university undergraduate.
Although, according to the Baconians,
he was none of these things, his plays,
again according to the Baconians, re-
veal a profound knowledge of the law,
an intimate acquaintance with the sea,
an understanding of philosophy, an
exact knowledge of the manners, cus-
toms, weaknesses and 'foibles of the
aristocracy and of royal Courts. Put-
ting aside the assumption that, because
the writer of the plays used a few nauti-
cal terms he might have picked up in
crossing the Thames, he must have
served before the mast; and that he
must have been a lawyer because he
used legal terms that should be known
to anybody who has ever been hauled
up for a traffic breach, we are still left
with the fact that there was in Eliza-
bethan times a man who wrote plays
which give a convincing picture of life.
He must therefore have been a cul-
tured man.
So Shakspeare, to justify his alleged
authorship, must have been a cultured
man. Thus argue the Baconians. But,
unfortunately, they never define what
they mean by a cultured man. Rem-
brandt was probably the most cultured
man of his time and place. He could
make a tree look like a tree, a hill look
like a hill and a man look like a man.
Yet nobody says he could not have
painted his pictures because, although
he was a consummate painter, he was
not at the same time a botanist, a geolo-
gist or an anatomist.
The simple fact is that Rembrandt
was trying to solve certain problems of
light and shade, problems with which
the knowledge of the botanist, geologist
and anatomist have nothing whatever to
do ; and the man, whoever he was, who
wrote the Shakspearean plays was try-
ing to solve certain problems concerned
with why people behave as they do.
It is true that when he introduced
matters of fact it would have been better
for the facts to be correct. It would
have been better if he had not given a
sea coast to Bohemia and watches to
Roman Senators. But it is also true that
a lawyer who has attended the courts for
20 years cannot give you a convincing
picture either of himself or his daily
environment. He could only give you
a set of prejudices and conventions
about it. The average seaman can tell
you nothing about the sea. The aver-
age courtier can give you nothing but
flapdoodle about the life of palaces. A
writer, even a relatively inferior writer,
after a single visit will tell you more
about a Court, a soiree or a fo’c’sle than
their habitues will have learnt in their
whole career.
I don’t suppose for a moment that the
foregoing remarks will deter a single
Baconian going on rumbling about his
hobby to the crack of doom. If he
drops the subject at all, in 100 years or
so, it will only be to take up the
equally important question as to whether
Henry Lawson wrote the works ascribed
to him. I have the gravest doubts
myself. There is no record that Henry
was a brewer, a doctor, a boardinghouse-
keeper, a Digger, a tailor, a bar-room
steward, a drover’s sweetheart or an
English baronet.
W. SPOKESHAVE.
The Crime of
the Fellowship
Cecil Mann’s
disaporoval of the
Fe 11 o wship of
Australian
Writers, and, in
passing, of similar
bodies (R.P. 26/9/’34), was based on
something which does not exist. Although
I write this as a private member of it, I
may claim, as its secretary, to have a
certain knowledge of the Fellowship.
Referring to “such organisations as
the Fellowship,” he says:
To what else can they or do they aspire
than to social triumph? What other ex-
cuse can they offer for their existence?
The reply is, none. Nor does the Fel-
lowship of Australian Writers aspire to
anything else, provided that the word
“social” is understood in its true impli-
cation of sociability of fellowship.
Referring to “any so-called writers’
society,” Mr. Mann says:
If they would admit frankly to what
they wholly are—strictly social organisa-
tions —I would have no quarrel with them.
They won’t admit it.
But they do admit it. At least the
Fellowship does, and it is against this
organisation particularly that the article
tilts. It admits the social nature of its
purpose so frankly that it chose a name
like “Fellowship” rather than, say, “asso-
ciation,” in order to express, beyond all
doubt, its essential sociability of aim.
Cecil Mann continues:
....they presume to be instigators of
writing. They cannot instigate, they never
have instigated and they never will insti-
gate —
Of course not; and, notwithstanding
Mr. Mann’s assertion, they do not “pre-
sume to be instigators of writing.” They
never have so presumed ; and, since Mr.
Mann’s objection is definitely based on
what he so wrongly assumes they have
so wrongly presumed, it is clear that he
is acidulating up the wrong tree.
The list of members of the Fellowship
includes most of our prominent practi-
tioners of writing in its various phases—
journalistic, scientific, historical, imag-
inative, fictional, prosodic, and so on.
The Fellowship was founded by Mary
Gilmore, not as an austere or insincere
association but as a fellowship. The
first president was Professor Brereton,
who was not avid of Mr. Mann’s
“candlelight.” Nor is it a fellowship of
authors, or of poets, or of literary
geniuses, but of unpretentious “writers.”
In pursuance of its ideal of fellow-
ship it holds friendly meetings, some-
times to discuss matters of interest to
those concerned with the trade of writ-
ing, sometimes merely to enable mem-
bers to meet in sociable intercourse with
more general comfort than is achieved
by leaning one elbow on a bar.
The admission that the Fellowship is
social must not be misunderstood. No
one who has not established a claim to
be regarded as a “writer” in the accepted
meaning of the word can become a
member. “Social” status, to use that
word in a restricted sens?, is no qualifi-
cation. This point intrudes because Mr.
Mann fails to make it clear whether he
uses the word “social” in its pristine
sense or in some such restricted manner
or piece of ambiguity, which would have
been avoided had he used the associa-
tion’s own carefully-chosen word “fel-
lowship.” But in'that case he would
have had nothing to write about.
Since the well-being of writers is a
fellowly thing to consider, the Fellow-
ship, among other activities, seeks to
organise an Australian Book Week. In
this it aims merely, if possible, to bene-
fit writers, indirectly, by increased sales.
Admittedly, if sales of writings be in-
creased, this incidentally 1 might “insti-
gate” further writing. But Mr. Mann
can rest assured that the “instigation”
will have been adventitious, not inten-
tional.
Another activity of the Fellowship is
the offering of a prize “for the unpub-
lished work of most distinctive literary
merit.” This again is purely social, and
not instigatory, in intention. Entrants
will not be inspired to literary achieve-
ment by such an offer. The urge to any
serious literary effort, as Mr. Mann im-
plies, comes from within, and must ever
do so. But that is no reason why any
such achievement should not receive
what friendly, and even practical, recog-
nition may be within the scope of fellow-
writers to give.

Cecil Mann’s
grouch (Red
Page 17/10/’34)
against the Aus-
tralian Literature
Society on ac-
count of its voracious request for books
to be displayed at its exhibition seems
just, on the surface.
Out of sympathy for him, and Austra-
lian writers in general, “I should like”
to explain that the reason the A.L.S.
does not buy more books than it does
is. the same reason that prevents Aus-
tralian authors from distributing their
books free—it has not the money to do
so. But if authors refrain from telling
the society to buy their books, “or, alter-
natively, go to the devil,” it need not
necessarily be because they are not'
“sufficiently independent or assertive of
ordinary rights.” It may simply be that
good manners forbid them, or it may
be that they are sincere, not sarcastic, in
expressing their appreciation of the work
that the A.L.S. is endeavoring to do on
behalf of Australian authors.
In his wrath Mr. Mann condemns the
A.L.S. as grasping. Has a literature
society not a better right to receive a
free copy of a book than a commercial
newspaper, if it makes good use of it?
If circumstances prevent it from dis-
tributing golden apples to every writer
who publishes a book it need not, there-
fore, be summarily condemned.

Judges for the
£25 Humor
Competition
The Bulletin
£25 Hum orous
Story Competi-
tion remains
open until Janu-
ary 31 next; and
entries considered worthy will be paid
for at usual rates and published as they
come to hand. Therefore, what better
judging could there be than by a small
board of regular Bulletin readers? Such
a board has been selected, and it happens
to be composed of men extra specially
qualified for the job. They are:
D. H. Souter, himself famous as a
humorous writer and artist; a member
of the board of judges which selected ‘‘A
House Is Built” as winner of the first
Bulletin Novel Competition.
Tom Mutch, who has been a journal-
ist and writer as well as a Parliamen-
tarian ; and most certainly has a sense
o( humor.
J. C. Bancks, known to every small
(and grown up) boy in the land as the
creator of Ginger Meggs ; a writer in
other spheres (“Blue Mountain Melody,”
for example), and altogether one whose
sense of humor is not open to any doubt.
These judges will read and retain the
entries published from week to week, and
shortly after the closing date will con-
sider all these together with the unpub-
lished ones then in hand. Details of the
competition have been published ; those
who missed them should send stamped
addressed envelope with request to Red

A Satchel of Books
A Guide to Modern Politics, by
G. D. H. and M. I. Cole (Gollancz;
6s. net). The authors are the well-known
International Socialists, and naturally
the work is charged with their ideas ;
nevertheless, it is sufficiently impartial to
be taken as reliable. Few who think at
all will dispute their contention that
politics to-day is something from which
no one can stand aloof, however much
he might like to —that, in fact, we are
all in it up to the neck. They supply
a finely indexed and documented survey
of just what this mess is that we are
up to the neck in.
Angel Making Music, by Ferenc Mol-
nar (Ivor Nicholson and Watson ; 7s. 6d.).
First of the Hungarian playwright’s
novels to be translated into English, this
is a freshly-treated serio-comedy of a
girl’s passion for a man who does not
want her and knows whom he does want.
Technically interesting in the economical
method of the presentation. It is thor-
oughly a playwright’s novel. Dialogue,
which forms the bulk of it, is pure stage ;
and such linking matter as comes between
is in the stage-directions manner. As
pastime reading, light, easy and pleasant.
The Long Day Closes, by Beatrice
Tunstall (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d. ). Nicely
managed light romance of the “I, Chris-
topher Churche, tell this story of many
strange happenings” variety. Set in the
part and the time of the English country-
side in which Dick Turpin figured. As
pastime reading most reliable.

THE RESOURCEFUL
AUSTRALIAN.
The people of Albury have received a
gift of money for their public hospital
in circumstances highly creditable to
them, although the credit does not belong
to them alone.
Reaching Charleville at nightfall on
October 23, the Dutchmen in the Doug-
las set out on the last stage of their
12,000-mile journey from Mildenhall
about eight o’clock. They had been fly-
ing all day from Darwin, and Melbourne
was 787 miles away ; but they thought
they could make it in four or five hours
—they had been averaging 180 m.p.h.
easily. Their course was almost due
south. Nothing untoward happened
until they had travelled a little more than
half the distance ; then they ran into a
storm, the forerunner of the floods in
the Upper Murray and the Riverina,
which extended south over the border
and north to Canberra and beyond. In
the fury of the elements they wandered
and lost their way.
With rain beating on the ’plane and
wind rocking it, they rose to a great
height. It grew so cold that ice formed
on the wings. Their plight had become
known, and all the broadcasting stations
were sending out guiding signals; but
the signals were not picked up.
In the blackness of the wild night, the
lost ’plane reached the region of Aus-
tralia’s greatest river. South-east it sped
over the huddle of mountains in which
the mystery of the Southern Cloud is still
hidden; south-west it turned, trying
to reach Melbourne, until it was within
50 miles of the sea in which, four days
before, the Miss Hobart had been en-
gulfed. Back north it went, and
watchers saw lights flickering from un-
known settlements on the Murray and
places south; but where was there a
beacon, and where a landing ground?
It was now past midnight, and the
thunder and lightning were terrific. The
drone of the engine could be heard over
Wodonga, Beechworth, Wangaratta,
Albury and places in between. All were
instructed by wireless to light flares and
fires, and directional messages were shot
into the ether unceasingly, while SOS
after SOS went out from the ’plane. Con-
tact was established at last; the Doug-
las then had been flying over Wodonga
and round about for something like an
hour.
All this time people in the region of
the Murray were standing by their re-
ceiving sets. From Station 2CO Corowa
came an appeal to motorists in the Albury
district to drive their cars to the race-
course and park them about the middle,
with headlights blazing. Upwards of a
hundred obeyed, and massed their cars in
a circle. Resourceful people improved on
these instructions. The municipal en-
gineer turned on the town light's. Men
in the post office manipulating a switch
signalled the word “Albury” in Morse.
A corresponding signal was flashed from
Albury’s fine war memorial, which is
always lighted at night. At the race-
course a man poured petrol on the grass
in the form of a letter “L” and lit it.
By this time the Douglas was overhead.
Guided by these intelligent people, the
weary airmen circled about the race-
course a few times and then came to
earth in perfect safety. Lost for two
hours over some of the wildest country
in Australia, they had been flying for
upwards of five hours in a machine with
a range of five hours and a half ; and
daylight nearly five hours off. It was a
near thing.
Australia has paid little attention to
this incident, but it has made a great
impression on the Dutch. From the
Minister of Foreign Affairs at The Hague
came a cablegram conveying “the thanks
of the Government of Holland to the
Mayor of Albury for his help and that
of his people on the night of the storm.”
The Royal Dutch Airline asked for “the
privilege of being allowed to contribute
1000 guilders [£lBo] to the Albury Dis-
trict Hospital,” and its staff paid a tribute
to the “noble assistance” rendered.
“Thanks to all concerned, particularly
the broadcasters,” came from a Rotary
Club in Java ; the “opportune and will-
ing aid” was stressed by a Rotary Club
in Sumatra ; and the staff of the Nether-
lands Steamship Co. was grateful for the
“kind co-operation.” Other cablegrams
and radiograms arrived from grateful
Dutch in the homeland and the colonies,
and a writer in the Amsterdam “Tele-
graaf,” remembered in Australia for its
Raemakers, waxed dithyrambic in praise
of “the unknown Australians who gath-
ered in cars at Albury, despite terrible
weather, at dead of night.”
Thanks to you, wc walk the streets to-
day with smiling faces. Here’s to world-
comradeship and to the Australians!
All this rather astonished the people of
Albury, who were not conscious of hav-
ing done anything out of the way.
Nor perhaps had they, judged by Aus-
tralian standards. Precisely the same
sort of help was given by the people of
Mt. Isa (N.Q.) when Cathcart Jones’s
Comet got off the track at night. Said
Cathcart Jones:
While we were circling above the town
they switched on all the lights and got
people with cars to light up the aerodrome.
Considering that they could not know much
about flying and the requirements of a
pilot at night, those miners at Mt. Isa
were absolutely efficient. They saved our
lives. Waller and I are most grateful to
them. It was a marvellous effort.
But that is the Australian all over. A
queer fellow, perhaps, but all wool and
a yard wide in an emergency. Shy,
really, but capable of blustering to con-
ceal it (an oddity that has deceived many
a stranger); stubborn to the point of
sacrificing material interests where his
rights are concerned, or he thinks they
are ; loyal to his party or his union, with
a strange, inert loyalty when the cause
is tainted or lost; deficient in imagina-
tion, lethargic at times, easy-going; but
swift to respond to the instant need: the
man for a perilous moment. Whether a
child has been lost in waterless country
or a bather is struggling with a shark
or a miner is imprisoned in flooded
workings, danger brings out his best
qualities—his and hers.
Off Diggers’ Headland, near Wooli,
Northern N. S. Wales, a huge wave hit
a launch and swept two fishermen into
the sea. One scrambled back and hung
on, though the boat threatened to cap-
size at any moment; the other, after
repeated efforts to reach his mate, struck
out for the shore, 300 yards away, and
began to swim back with a line. He was
joined by his mate’s brother, who, with
a number of women, had run to the
beach ; and the brother, relieving him of
the line, swam with it to the boat. But
it was not long enough, and both
brothers were reduced to clinging to the
craft. Then, as a newspaper narrative
proceeds:—
Fuller, who had also reached the boat,
again faced the long swim back to the shore.
His mate, whose strength and endurance
had been severely taxed, followed him.
Dragged from the boiling surf by the
women, who waded into the water up to
their armpits, he collapsed on the beach.
Undaunted, Fuller swam out once more
with a line tied round his waist. Cecil
Martin was still clinging to the boat.
The two men tied themselves together,
and, sometimes under water and sometimes
out of it, they were slowly hauled by the
women to the shore. Just as their feet had
almost reached the sand, the line broke.
Martin, however, grasped Fuller, and the
women, wading almost out of their depth,
dragged the men to safety. They had been
in the water for almost three hours.
The three men lay unconscious on the
beach. As they were too heavy to
carry to their homes, the women brought
beds to the beach, heated them with hot-
water bottles and gave the men stimulants.
The men were still lying on the beds, com-
pletely exhausted, when the ambulance
officers arrived from Grafton, the last
six miles of their 40-mile journey through
sand.
A day or two after this happened there
were great demonstrations at Melbourne
in honor of the competitors in the air
race. One of the stout fellows, speaking
at a State luncheon, suggested that Mac-
pherson Robertson’s name would go
roaring down the ages. The cheers of
the crowd were ringing in his ears and,
along with his companions, he had be-
come the owner of a medal with the
Macpherson Robertson head on one side
and the Macpherson Robertson trade-
mark on the clasp, and no doubt he was
a little overcome. There was no such
excuse for Premier Argyle, who said “We
have as our guests some of the most
remarkable men the world has ever
seen.” Fine lads all, and competent
withal; nobody would question their
expertness in operating the marvellous
machines made for them (by whom?) or
the superb quality of their courage.
Their spectacular achievements thrill;
but a nation is exalted more by the
heroism of the humble who never get
on the front page, and by deeds like that
of the Albury people which has excited
such a passion of gratitude in the Dutch.
A CASE FOR SNAIL BROOMS.
Six weeks from now, according to
arrangements made when Mr. Parkhill
was P.M.G. and Mr. Pearce Minister in
charge of aerial transport,’air mails will
be carried from Australia to England. A
departmental communication on the sub-
ject is worth preserving:
The service is scheduled to leave Darwin
on Friday and reach London on the
following Monday week. Return mails
will leave London on Saturday and arrive
at Darwin on Tuesday week following.
With exquisite, if unconscious, humor,
this was published while Scott’s Comet
was flying from Mildenhall to Darwin in
52 hours 34 minutes. The tariff was
added: —
Charges to the U.K. are: Postcards, 9d.
per \oz. ; other articles, Is. 6d. per \oz.
Slight increases cover dispatches to Euro-
pean air ports. Letters for Singapore
will be 9d. per Joz.
One and six per half-ounce is 12 times
the rate which the trans-U.S.A. services
charge for a quarter of the distance. But
the departmental mind is now in a whirl
on this phase of the subject, and some
“modification” may be decided upon.
There seems to be equal doubt about
the machines. The “Imperial Airways
Gazette”—l.A. will fly the London-Singa-
pore section —thus described the chosen
type in its March issue:
The smallest airliner yet constructed.
In addition to a crew of two she will carry
up to 10 passengers at a speed of more
than 120 m.p.h.
An assurance was given that these aero-
planes would be “particularly suitable for
feeder services for main Empire airlines.”
A month later the “Qantas Gazette” —
Qantas will handle the Singapore-Aus-
tralia run —pronounced the type “ideal
for the Singapore-Brisbane service,” and
allowed it “a cruising speed of 145
m.p.h.”
The Dutch airliner, carrying seven per-
sons, 4001 b. of mails and 4001 b. of spare
parts, flew from Mildenhall to Mel-
bourne in 3 days 18 hours, inclusive of
19 stops —and a storm cost it at least
10 hours. This achievement has made
the Commonwealth’s 12-day schedule
look ridiculous, and even the bureaucracy
admits that something will have to be
done about it. The Government hopes
to speed up the trip to 10 days by cut-
ting out some of the stopping places.
Mr. Parkhill explains that “recent de-
velopments in national air services
throughout the world have rendered
obsolete information of a year ago.” But
it is more than a year since The Bulle-
tin wrote that “Rip Van Winkle would
have been delighted with the Civil Avia-
tion Department,” whose ambition had
not then got beyond a 16-17-day service.
It pointed out that a mail ’plane had
crossed the U.S.A., 2650 miles, in 10
hours 47 minutes, and that mails were
regularly being flown by Uncle Sam at
over 200 m.p.h.
During 1933 Mr. Parkhill went abroad
at a cost to the taxpayers of nearly
£3OOO. At that time, according to the
1933 edition of “Commercial Aircraft,”
26 Douglas machines for mail and pas-
senger carriage were being built in the
U.S.A. —machines identical in every
respect with the one piloted by Parmen-
tier and Moll. No consciousness of their
existence or of that of the modern Boe-
ings, A.Ds. or Northrop Deltas, with
average speeds of 200 m.p.h. or more,
reached Mr. Parkhill’s mind. Yet on
his return to Australia the people were
informed that the said mind was brim-
ming over with up-to-the-minute know-
ledge acquired on his costly wanderings,
and before long he was promoted.
Of a piece with these rulers of the air-
mail navy are the State railway and tram-
way bosses and rubber-stamp politicians
who have been conducting a war of
extermination on private motor-’bus, pas-
senger and lorry services. While their
energies have been absorbed in this en-
lightened task, the railway engineering
thought of the outer world has been con-
centrated on Diesel-electric trains —
streamlined wonders weighing 80 tons or
so. Germany has one which does the
180 miles from Berlin to Hamburg in
2 hours 18 minutes, 78| m.p.h., at a fuel
cost of £3 for the journey. The fare is
235. The Aibury-Melbourne express
takes 5 hours 10 minutes to travel much
the same distance. The N.S.W. Railway
Department proudly announces that it
has speeded up the Sydney-Newcastle
train to 57 m.p.h. “An expert examina-
tion of the most progressive timetables
in the world” has convinced it that, “tak-
ing the severity of the track into account,
there are no schedules in the world
timed as hard as our northern fliers and
the Caves Express.” This when messages
like the following are reaching Aus-
tralia :
Union Pacific’s Diesel-engined stream-
lined train has reached New York from
Los Angeles, 3259 miles, in 56hr. 56min.,
averaging 57J m.p.h. The previous record,
made by a steam train in 1906, was
71 hr. 27min. The train is 376 ft. long, and
is drawn by a 900-h.p. Diesel engine. At
one period between Chicago and New
York it set a world rail speed record of
120 m.p.h.
The next lot of Commonwealth and
N.S.W. estimates should include a fair
round sum for the purchase of snail
brooms. Obviously there is a plague
of the slothful creatures in our transport
departments.
FLAG-WAGGING AND FACTS.
Babbitt and his fellow-Rotarians were
ever-ready to cheer the spellbinder who
raved about the glorious Eagle of Liberty,
but it is tolerably certain that the sales-
man who could cut the price five cents
in a hundred dollars or submit a sample
5 p.c. more appealing than his rivals
would get the contract, whether he hap-
pened to be black, white or brindle.
Business is business. The sooner the
Australian wakes up to that fact the
better it will be for the sale of Austra-
lian produce overseas. Especially butter.
Britain is Australia’s biggest market,
and the hands-across-the-sea racket has
been worked for all it’s worth. Yet
Britain still consumes prodigious quan-
tities of Danish butter and pays a
higher price for it than for the
product of the far-flung Empire on
which the sun never sets. The pub-
licity-men who try to push the sale of
Australian butter in England have waved
the Union Jack to some advantage. It
is probable that such sentimental appeal
has resulted largely in the British con-
sumption of Australian butter being as
great as it is. But the Empire stuff has
reached saturation point. The patriotic
Briton has been roped in. Australia needs
to rope in the unpatriotic one who is
wedded to Danish butter by birth and
breeding and taste developed by long
familiarity.
It is ho use flapping the Union Jack
before such a householder. He must be
shown that he is getting something better
for his money—that Australian butter is
better than Danish butter. Australia can
show this householder that such is the
case. It must adopt the methods of the
private producer who, having secured
every purchase possible by “general pub-
licity,” goes after the waverers by stern
logic, backed by facts—if he has them.
Australia has those facts. Scientific in-
vestigation proves that the butter of this
country is superior to the butter of Den-
mark in vitamin content, and vitamin
content is the factor that makes for
health and development in human beings,
especially children. The Australian cow
from which our butter is derived and the
grass which supplies the raw material of
her milk are developments of outdoor
life, grown and living in the free sun-
light and air and absorbing from both
the elements that make for vitamin con-
tent. Danish butter comes from cows
which are housed and hand-fed ; their
butter, compared with the Australian
article, is deficient in vitamin content; a
pound of Australian butter contains as
much health-giving material as a pound
and a quarter of Danish.
This fact has never been stressed, only
incidentally mentioned, by the Austra-
lian Government in pushing the sale of
Australian butter in England. It should
be the first line of attack; it should
constitute the prime appeal to the British
householder. And not in respect of
butter only. What applies to Australian
butter is also true more or less of Aus-
tralian beef, mutton, flour, oatmeal,
sugar, fruit, jam, eggs, wine and beer —
yes, beer! A cloud of witnesses, from
John Masefield down, has testified to
the healthy appearance of the Austra-
lians, and sober statisticians record that
of all countries only Maoriland has a
lower infant-mortality rate or a lower
crude death-rate. These are effects not
only of sound racial stocks developing
in a favorable environment but of good
Australian food.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Unity at Last.
It was here suggested that Mr. Lyons’s
“queer Big-City Government would not
last.” It lasted less than three weeks.
Naturally country U.A.P. members re-
sented the distribution of all the port-
folios among gentlemen from the capitals.
Ex-Minister Perkins went so far as to
threaten to join the Country party. A
storm was brewing over the unquestioned
admission to the House of Mr. Garden,
formerly of the Communist International.
Other issues were arising, on any one
of which the Government might be de-
feated.
Mr. Lyons is no intellectual giant, but
he does not lack sagacity or shrewdness.
The news that a deputation of wool-
growers was on the way to Canberra
quickened his disposition to arrive at
an accommodation. The deputation was
introduced by a country U.A.P. member,
and was accompanied by three others
and three Agrarian Ms.H.R.; it told him
frankly that the position of the wool-
growers had become “serious”:
The wool industry has been conducted
since its inception without seeking pro-
tection. It now asks for conditions which
will enable it to continue to sell on the
world’s markets.
That same day Mr. Lyons and Dr. Page
concluded an arrangement whereby Dr.
Page becomes deputy-leader of the Gov-
ernment* and three of his followers be-
come Ministers. It is a pity it was not
arrived at before the general election, but
better late than never. Our greatest
industry will no longer lack repre-
sentation at Canberra, and its require-
ments can be attended to without tam-
pering with the national fiscal policy.
For a beginning it might be relieved ,of
the burdens of land tax and the “special”
6 p.c. tax on property income which
keeps up the rate of mortgage interest.
And with unity achieved the Govern-
ment will now be free to tackle unem-
ployment without the doubts and diffi-
culties inseparable from rule by mino-
rity. On this subject its Attorney-
General, in his first speech in the national
Parliament, struck a deep note. As he
suggested to it, all the parties are inter-
ested in getting the workless back to
work, all the parties desire it, and all the
parties should help.

McArthur and a Moral.
In the case of the McArthur “trust”
companies, the Maoriland and N. S.
Wales Governments have been acting in
concert. Moved by the reports of the
Royal Commissions which both set up,
they introduced legislation designed to
place the management of the business in
each country under the Public Trustee.
The Maoriland bill was passed; the
N.S.W. measure was held up by Lang-
sters in the Leg. Council. Its passage—
with a retrospective clause introduced to
circumvent the stonewallers—is never-
theless assured.
Mr. Lang’s opposition to the bill
astonished some people, but others have
ceased to be capable of astonishment
where Mr. Lang is concerned. He got
his “facts” from a pamphlet, “McArthur
Strikes Back at Coates and the Kelly
Gang”—McArthur’s description of a
group of Maoriland financial magnates
against whom he alleges persecution.
Whatever the ultimate fate of McArthur
and his maze of companies—and even he
doesn’t seem to know how they really
stand financially—he is booked for an
argument with the income-tax people in
respect of shares allotted to him. How
debenture-holders in the group will
fare remains to be seen. It will be
the job of the new managers to
make an estimate of the position as
quickly as possible. And it is to be
hoped that the N.S.W. Public Trustee
office will make a better fist of it than it
did in the case of Anzil Hempland Bonds.
It is to be hoped also that there will be
no further delay in passing a proper
N.S.W. company law. For 20 years reput-
able commercial men have been crying
out for adequate company legislation—in
vain; hence McArthurs. Those who
accept the advantages of limited liability
should be prepared to conform with
reasonable obligations, but in N. S. Wales
they are not required to do so.

The Man in the Machine.
Thoughts of a doctor who is no stranger
to flying:
When passenger ’planes crash or plunge to
the bottom of the sea, there is an eruption of
theories based on mechanical considerations in-
volving failure of the machines. A more likely
explanation is that of sudden failure of the
! brains and bodies which controlled them.
Commercial pilots are relatively young m
years, but there is an old and sound medical
aphorism that a man is as old as his arteries.
The daily life of a pilot carries periods of great
strain and intense realisation of responsibility,
even though, by use and custom, the concurrent
anxiety is reduced to the subconscious planes
of cerebration. Five out of six press pictures
of pilots show the effects of their occupation,
despite the professional smile. Some show
more. In press portraits of one poor fellow
who has gone to his there could be
distinguished clearly those prominent zigzag
arteries across the temple which, even to a
non-medical eye, spell danger of a “stroke.”
No matter what safeguards of dual controls
and assistant pilots are provided, the safety of
a ’plane, flying at the heights ordinarily used
for commercial air-navigation in average
weather, is subject entirely to the physical
efficiency of the pilot. This efficiency may be
abolished in an instant of time. A blood-vessel
breaking in brain or heart, even a sudden faint-
ing fit, and an insensible body falls forward on
the controls, sending the speeding machine into
an instantaneous dive at full speed, aided by
gravity. To pull the body clear of the controls
would alone occupy several seconds, and before
the necessary mechanical adjustments could be
made, a dead weight of several tons would be
plunging down at the rate of 300 feet a second,
or more. Even were it possible to flatten out
in time, the wings of commercial machines
are not built to withstand such strains.
Under the Merchant Shipping Acts, care is
taken to ensure that deck officers are physically
fit to perform their duties. The physical effi-
ciency of any individual air pilot is of greater
importance than that of any individual ship’s
officer. Civil air pilots are, of course, required
to undergo medical examinations of much the
same kind, but, in the best interests of Aus-
tralian aviation and for the safety of the air-
travelling public, these should be of a more
searching and effective nature. Also, they should
be repeated, both periodically and as any
special conditions appear to require. Exhaus-
tive tests and records are maintained in respect
of the machine; it seems mere commonsense
to require that equally thorough precautions
should be taken to eliminate, as far as is
humanly possible, risk of sudden failure of the
bodily mechanism of the man.

Making the Railways Pay.
A Victorian called at The Bulletin
office with a plan for making the N.S.W.
railways pay. His idea is that they
should be placed under the control of
the Taxation Department, with orders to
tax and let traffic go.
Last April he began to run a tourist*
car from Sydney to Melbourne and back.
Victoria charged him nothing for special
registration, though he expects it will
exact fees now there is a new Transport
Act. N. S. Wales decided that 10s. sd.
tax per passenger would be a fair thing.
His passengers are people of moderate
means who want to see the country,
stopping here and there to view historic
spots and to have a meal. It was his cus-
tom to deliver them in Gundagai the first
night and in Melbourne the second night.
He charged them £2 15s. (second-class
rail fare), and the business prospered so
much that he decided to make the
journey weekly. He reckoned without
the N.S.W. Transport Department. That
concern wrote that there were for-
malities to be observed. Annual regis-
tration, 4s. 3d. per fewt. on weight
of vehicle ; plus Id. per passenger per
mile from Albury to Sydney and Sydney
to Albury (in advance each trip); plus
a bond of £l5O ; plus an over-all insur-
ance cover for passengers, £3OOO ; plus
a third-party policy of £lOOO. His
annual budget under this scheme would
work out as follows:
Revenue, 104 trips, 4 passengers
average, at £2/15/- per passen-
ger £1144 0 0
N.S.W. Registration £l5 14 0
Tax, Id. per mile .. 710 14 0
Insurance .. .. 22 10 0
Petrol .. .. 325 0 0
Depreciation .. 100 0 0
: £1173 18 0
Leaving a deficit of £29 18s., without
accounting for tyres, oil, minor break-
ages, 104 nights’ accommodation for the
driver, garage expenses and the Vic-
torian’s own share, plus taxation outside
transport tax. He points out that even
if he put his fare up to well beyond
first-class railway fare (£4) it wouldn’t
pay. Apart from that, the class of tourist
who travels with him couldn’t afford it.
The Victorian thinks that a Govern-
ment which has the nerve to exact £726
Bs. in taxation out of £ll44 —one-third of
it earned outside N. S. Wales —is wasting
its time running a railway system which
lost £3,432,000 last year. Assuming that
its average trainload is carried only 20
miles —and it must be much more —it
could place the railways out of commis-
sion and impose a tax of Id. per
passenger and Id. per cwt. of freight per
mile, letting private enterprise do the.
work. This would bring in at least
£3,000,000 more revenue than is now
obtained. N. S. Wales railways carry
130,000,000 passengers and 10,000,000
tons of freight p.a.
The Victorian cancelled his service. If
he can’t earn a living there is always the
dole.
Phases of Mr. Stuart Doyle.
Consistency is a jewel, but Mr. Stuart
Doyle has a mind above baubles. Giv-
ing evidence before the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s Royal Commission on the Film
Industry, he said:
I advocate a quota for Australian films
if and when Australian producers can prove
that any Australian picture of merit is not
readily shown throughout the Common-
wealth, or if there is any attempt by any
exhibiting organisation to prevent such films
being shown No Australian producer
has presented evidence to prove that with a
picture of good quality he cannot get a
reasonable release in all theatres.
Very pretty; but in a petition prepared
a few weeks earlier for presentation to
the Chief Secretary different sentiments
were expressed.
The petition took the form of an
application by film companies “for a
permit to show Australian picture pro-
ductions in a temporary structure
throughout N. S. Wales, to wit, a canvas
marquee,” and was signed by concerns
in which Mr. Stuart Doyle is interested.
It pleaded:
The distributors of our films in some
instances have found it very difficult to
dispose of these productions at a reasonable
price, especially in centres where the local
hall is leased by the local exhibitor and
not being used, and the price offered in
some instances would not pay us to have
our films shown.
Where the exhibitor refuses to give
a reasonable and just hire we would like to
have some means of having our product
exhibited to the public, and in such in-
stances we are prepared to go to the ex-
pense of erecting a marquee with proper
seating to show our productions.
It goes without saying, of course, that
“approved fire-resisting construction”
would be used throughout (possibly asbes-
tos canvas would be employed), and that
all other provisions of the Act which the
rejected Liberty Theatre plans infringed
would be strictly complied with.

Transport and Communists.
From a Sydney tramwayman:
If our union is captured by the Militant
Minority, the department will be to blame. Our
officials have a constant job trying to explain
departmental actions to the men, and make a
poor fist of it because they are incomprehen-
sible.
A conductor with three days’ service was
charged with having failed to issue a ticket.
We were able to prove that eight seconds
elapsed between receipt of the fare and arrival
of the examiners and that the conductor still
had the two pennies. No good; he went out
of the service branded as a thief.
A conductor was charged by a passenger
with a cash-fare irregularity and suspended for
three days before the charge was investigated.
Then the accusation was proved baseless. The
department paid him for lost time and
washed its hands of the affair. Repeated appli-
cations by the union for some sort of satisfac-
tion drew only the reply that the man had not
been punished.
By reading something into the award which
my organisation claims is not there, the depart-
ment has succeeded in taking away penalty
rates from casual conductors. The gain to the
State is a few pounds per year, considerably
less than the amount of the recent increases to
selected officers.
Meantime, hundreds of pounds are lost
weekly in George-street because men are
unable to collect all the revenue offering. If
the conductor holds up the tram before reach-
ing the section, according to regulations, the
driver is punished for not obeying another
regulation about maintaining the timetable.
The service has been modernised by accelera-
tion, but the administration lags behind. Trying
to do modern work with obsolete tools has
brought many new worries to the staff and
the administration will not, or admit it cannot,
make tools and work co-ordinate. It is so
easy to-day to find serious fault with the
management that the Reds are having the time
of their lives.
Minister Bruxner has had his speech on tram-
way matters published and it has occasioned
ribald mirth. We will forgive the inaccuracies,
however, if he will tell my organisation how it
is to get those meetings he says he is willing
to grant. We have tried every way except a
hold-up.

Not Only Justice Is Blind.
“El V.”: Australia must be a joy to
foreign naval visitors, who are allowed
to climb all over harbor foreshores, ap-
proaching forts or points on which de-
fences would be established in time of
war and photographing to their heart’s
content. No other country—not even
easy-going Britain —would permit this
sort of thing.
If the Reds ever seize Australia and I
decide to invade it, I shall be able to
determine with measured exactitude the
position of every vital spot in Sydney
-electricity-supply, railway-fuel depots
and forts. I hope Uncle Sam will be
on my side. For days he had ’planes up
from the cruisier Augusta when it was in
Sydney Harbor. His fliers may have
been merely,, joyriding, but if . they
took: full advantage of their oppor-
tunities and were properly equipped they
must have as good aerial data about our
main naval harbor as we have.
It,.doesn’t matter that it is “unthink-
able” that we ever should fight Ameri-
cans. The thing sets a precedent. I
should say it follows a precedent which
should have been abandoned 30 years
ago.
North Australia is now within 10 flying
hours of Asia. The New Guinea fron-
tiers have moved well north of Hong
Kong, and the last year’s developments
in aircraft have been so revolutionary as
to introduce a new era in aerial defence.
If it crawls true to form, the Defence
Department will realise this in the year
a.d. 2000.

Not Like Wentworth.
A Wentworth commemoration service
was held in Sydney last week all too
unobtrusively. Modern Australians do
not believe in things for which Went-
worth stood, but he was a model for
politicians. He didn’t buy votes or
pander.
He stood behind the emancipated con-
victs when every official hand was
against them. He established a free
press in the face of crushing official
opposition. He forced civil trial by jury
on a reluctant Administration. True, he
proposed the establishment of an Aus-
tralian House of Lords—he “had
no wish to sow the seeds of a
future democracy.” He advocated the
admission of black labor and the return
of the convict system at a time when
to do so was to risk being assaulted in
the streets.
Yet, opposing almost everything which
Australians now stand for, his sheer up-
rightness and consistency will make him
continue to be remembered when the
only memorial some of the current race
of political opportunists will have is a
passing sneer in old history books.

Respect for the Law.
“0.D.”: A writer in a Sydney daily
started it:
Law and order are maintained in the
community not so much because there are
police to apprehend offenders as because
most citizens respect the law, and acknow-
ledge their responsibility to comply with it.
A comforting thing this belief in the
integrity of Smith, Jones and Brown ;
but it would receive a terrific shock if
the police suddenly marched away to
Katoomba for a week and left Smith,
Jones and Brown to show their “respect
for the law.”
Let’s imagine Sydney without police,
and all the pubs open, on a fine day.
By nightfall the streets would be thronged
with restless people and the roads
jambed with gaily-cavorting and irre-
sponsible traffic. Mobs would gather;
louts would ogle girls and push old
men; pubs would please themselves
about closing sharp at 6 p.m; shop-
lifters would become active; a few
shopkeepers, not trusting Smith, Jones
and Brown, would close their doors.
On all sides would be windows full of
jewels, clothing, silks and foodstuffs.
Some little henpecked artisan from Bur-
wood would become conscious of the
absence of authority, and, inspired by
this, a few drinks and a feeling of reck-
less freedom, would put his boot through
a plate-glass window.
In 10 minutes the heart of the city
would be given over to loot-crazed
people fighting to get at the good things
while the getting was good. The crash
of glass would be heard. Girls would
scrag each other for possession of a
stolen fur coat or a rope of pearls.
Some anaemic youth would flatten an old
gentleman with a heavy nickel show-
stand and snatch from the old ’un’s hand
a cluster of rings and brooches, to be
in turn flattened by a drunk in a
flannel shirt and heavy boots, who would
throw the jewellery into the ravening
mob and shriek, “Help y’selves, y’ blan-
kards ; there’s plenty more! ” Such inci-
dents would be isolated ones of hun-
dreds, all happening within a mad hour
of riot, loot and bloodshed in the main
shopping centre of Sydney.
Then some stout citizen would orga-
nise a band of returned soldiers, irate
shopowners and lads out for a lark,
swear them in as special constables, and
set about restoring order. There would
be many broken heads, possibly some
deaths. The loss and damage would run
into £lOO,OOO.
My imagination has run riot, has it?
Well. I saw it all happen 11 years ago on
Derby night in Melbourne, when the
police were on strike. Ever since that
night, when some such statement is made
as that quoted above I feel the place on
my head where the beery bloke kicked
me, and am thankful that Smith, Jones
and Brown are surrounded by uniformed
incentives to “respect the law.”

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Little Marty”: Wide smiles are per-
vading Toorak as a result of a neat set-
back said to have been given by the wife
of a chain-store man to a patronising
dame who sweetly observed: “Our
family crest is a stag’s head over a
crown, Mrs. Chain. What is yours?”
Quick as lightning, but just as sweetly,
came the reply: “Ours is nothing over
half a crown.”

“M.G.”: Macpherson Robertson has
been at some pains to exonerate Kings-
ford Smith from charges made against
him by silly and suspicious people.
Nobody who knows Smith ever doubted
that he was acting fairly and squarely,
but, though superbly competent in the air,
he has always been a very slipshod per-
son in looking after his own interests.
In this particular instance, his interests
lay in his competing in the race, and by
faults of omission he robbed himself of
possibly the biggest profit-making
achievement of his life.

“Jackaburra”: It came to the shop

“Mako”: The police in a Maoriland
township had been watching a pub in
the hope of getting a conviction for
trading after hours, and had about
reached the limit of their enthusiasm
when one night they saw an unworthy
citizen emerge from the back door carry-
ing a stoppered jug. He was no mean
sprinter, and he led the two policemen
a merry dance through the scrub be-
fore they grabbed him. “Hand over that
beer!” one wheezed. “Wish it was
beer,” the captive replied. “It’s only
tea” ; and it was. How much real beer
went out the front door while they were
chasing the jug of cold tea the Johns
have failed to discover.

“Lullington”: Speaking of places that
have sprung into prominence on aero-
dromes (B. 24/10/’34), I wonder what is
the correct pronunciation of Laverton
(Vic.) —even the radio announcers don’t
seem quite certain whether the “a” is
short or long. There is, of course, a
Laverton in Westralia, an outback gold-
fields township. As this was named after
Dr. Laver, one of the most enterprising
of mining speculators in the roaring
’nineties, and brother of the Victorian
cricketer, the first syllable is long. On
the other hand, there is a Laverton in
England, a tiny Somersetshire village,
where the first syllable is as short as in
Claverton and Staverton, both in the
same neighborhood. If the Vic. Laver-
ton is an imported place-name, like so
many in this country, it ought to follow
precedent.
“P. 8.5.”: The other day a man doing
relief work in a populous Sydney suburb
helped a motorist to start his car. Half
an hour later the motorist returned with
a policeman, to whom he gave the worker
in charge for pinching his pants —“you’re
wearing ’em now,” he snorted. Some
weeks before, the motorist had reported
the strides as having been stolen from
his home, and, as the material was a pat-
tern called by tailors “exclusive,” he
easily recognised them. The accused hav-
ing explained that the pants had been
given to him by a welfare committee,
motorist and constable set off to solve the
puzzle. It took them half a day, the
worker cooling his heels in the police
station meanwhile. The motorist’s wife,
in response to a “drive” for old clothing,
had given a parcel of cast-offs. On dis-
covering that she had carelessly included
hubby’s best pants in the parcel, she had
allowed him to think that they had been
stolen from the clothes-line while they
were being aired. To the husband’s
credit, he supplemented the pants by a
ten-shilling note and fixed things so that
the worker didn’t lose any time; but
there is one man who swears that he
will toil in his pelt before he ever accepts
gift clothing again.

“Electrical Engineer”: “General Prac.”
is quite correct when he says that a man
dies by lightning stroke because he is
part of a conductor between some cloud
and earth (B. 24/10/’34), but, although
“Be ready to catch me, Freddie, if I fall.”
a wet man is a better conductor than a
dry one, the fact does not influence the
stroke itself. This hits the prominent
feature of the landscape ; it makes use of
man, hilltop, tree, church steeple or any-
thing else to conduct its charge to earth.
A properly-earthed metal structure will
discharge the stroke to earth, but non-
conducting objects in general are sub-
ject to splitting, shattering, firing and,
where the discharge passes down through
the centre of the material, to violent dis-
ruption. A transmission line being struck
would be a parallel case to that of a
human being. A 132,000-volt line usually
has insulators, with a wet flashover of
420,000 volts and a dry flashover of
57,000 volts. The “impulse” flashover
(that due to lightning) for a voltage wave
reaching its maximum in a quarter of a
millionth of a second, and subsequently
falling to 50 p.c. of this value in five
millionths of a second, is 1,400,000 volts,
either wet or dry. “General Prac.”
should stick to the “pleasing thrills” of
his small battery.
“D.E.”: Lightning has peculiarities
other than those noted by “General Prac.”
and “E.E.” It does comparatively little
damage in winter months, and it rarely
strikes women. Of eight Australians
killed by lightning in 1933, three were
struck in January, one in September and
two each in November and December;
none in the wet months. For the six
years 1928-33 inclusive, lightning killed
40 males and only three females. While
none of these years was free from male
victims (the number ranged from four
in 1928 to nine in 1932), 1928,
1930, 1931 and 1933 were clean
sheets as far as the other sex was
concerned. I suppose women don’t fre-
quent exposed places nearly so much as
men, but that can’t be the only explana-
tion of their strange immunity. My
authority is Commonwealth Statistician
McPhee ; Bulletins No. 50 and 51.

“Black Sleep”: The story of the lady-
opium smuggler (B. 31/10/’34) recalls
a yarn told me years agone by
one of the kings of the game
in Townsville (N.Q.). He had picked
up a consignment for Cairns at Cook-
town, and packed the tins in an old straw
hold-all. At Cairns he was “worded”
that all was not well, so he took the boat
back to Cooktown. There again he got
a tip, and he resolved to dump his swag.
Those who knew the Cooktown of those
days will recall the customs-house on
the right of the main street going up
from the boat. The building was then
an old-fashioned bungalow type with a
wide verandah, two or three steps lead-
ing up to the front entrance. At dead of
night my friend buried his opium under
the steps of the customs-house in the
soft, sandy soil —no asphalting about
Cooktown footpaths then. He left it
there for twelve months; then, after
several other good runs, he redeemed his
treasure and sold it.

“Windsor”: Weatherboard houses, you
say (B. 31/10/’34)? We had a very fine
one here in Windsor (N.S.W.); built by
Governor Hunter in 1798, it braved the
storms for considerably more than a
century. Hunter used it whenever he
came to Windsor; Macquarie set out
from it on Sundays, in all his scarlet
finery, to attend service at the Church
of St. Mathias, and it rang to the echoes
of the arguments he used to have with
Samuel Marsden. Here, also, the fathers
of Windsor got grants to the land which
their descendants still work. The build-
ing would still be standing, and a very
fine historical monument it would be,
were it not for our municipal fathers.
You’ve only to see our war memorial
to understand the type of thing that ap-
peals to them. They had the old Gov-
ernment cottage pulled down.

“G.M.”: The most picturesque cen-
tenarian we ever had in Australia was
Jeremiah Brown, who used to sit in front
of the “Cyclorama of the Battle of Water-
loo” at Melbourne in the early ’nineties
and relate his personal reminiscences of
Wellington and Bonaparte. Brown
claimed that, at the age of 15, he had
taken part in what we used to regard as
a battle, and he told all about the British
square at Quatre Bras, the sunken road
and the surrender at Hougoumont. Every-
body accepted him at face-value, though
his detailed knowledge seemed a little
too detailed. This was attributed to the
wanderings of an aged brain. One sad
day an indignant patriot wrote to the
press calling the local military authorities
foul names for permitting this brave
soldier to eke out a living by showman-
ship. The military authorities, who had
been good sports and held their tongues
up to that time, were forced to come out
in the open and spill the truth about
Jeremiah. He had not been born until
years after Waterloo was fought, and
had never been a soldier.

“Bank Clerk”: Tell “Pardon Me” (B.
24/10/’34) that members of bank staffs
have been referred to as “officers” for
many years. In the numerous battles
over awards clerks have been designated
legally as “officers” and banking as a
profession.

“Murlonga”: If Professor Elkin and
other authorities (B. 10/10/’34) object to
the term “guesswork” being applied to
their computation of the number of abos.,
I would like to know what they call it.
I knew of two officials who tried to make
a return of the abos. in the desert south of
the Barkly Tableland. These census-
takers had to rely on the figures given
them by others who, in their turn, got it
from the old bucks. One asked old
Woppida: “How many more blackfeller
out there ’nother side desert country?”
Old Wop., as always with a black, waited
for the white to give him a lead. “How
many you think-it, Woppida?” Woppida
grunted “Big mob out there.” Failing to
pin the native down to anything more
explicit the official wrote 187 in his book,
explaining to me that odd numbers were
lucky. Another official came along, and
Woppida, as the best-informed buck from
the desert country,, was put in .the box
again. The same course was followed ;
the same questions asked ; but this time
the official wrote 550 in his book, and pro-
ceeded to divide the lot into sexes, adults,
children, babes, and those who should be
in receipt of the old-age pension. After
the two “Guv’men’ fellows” had gone
away I took a hand with old Woppida.
He knew he could trust me, as I wasn’t
invested with any brass braid. But, all
the same, the old heathen was perfectly
ready to agree with anything I said. A
dozen or a. million were all the same to
him, provided “stick tumbacco” was
assured at the end of the interview.
“Oxmead”: If uniformity in cheque
forms is desirable (B. 31/10/’34) is it
any less so in postage stamps? The depart-
ment’s latest effort, which commemorates
the centenary of Victoria with a picture
of a plump and unclad blackfellow over-
looking a number of spires
and towers, is a full inch in
depth and over an inch and
a quarter in width —pre-
sumably the artist couldn’t
do himself justice in less.
But I can’t help thinking
that it must cause a lot of
profanity in post offices.
Even the normal Australian
stamp is noticeably bigger
than the English one,
though Maoriland has
fallen into line with the
U.K. in cutting down its
stamps to the handiest size. Also, its
stamps, like the English ones, carry a
face guarantee of their value for revenue
as well as postage. Ours did once.

“Second Murderer”: “Ike Hollar’s”
story of the citizen who had conscien-
tious objections to working on Sunday
because that was the day on which he
always went fishing recalls the case of
Horatio Kelson, sometime Mayor of
Coburg (Vic.). Kelson spent one Lord’s
Day in painting the front of his house,
to the great scandal of his pious neigh-
bors. He was prosecuted in the local
court under a Charles 11. Act for dese-
crating the Sabbath. The Bench of Js.P.
was about to fine the offender five bob,
when he pointed out that it had no juris-
diction, as the Act specified “working at
one’s trade,” and he (Kelson) was a bank
official. Moreover, he said, the alterna-
tive to the fine was a sitting in the stocks.
Case dismissed.

From “Trooper 926”:
I was in . Liverpool (N.S.W.) camp with
“Tibby” Cotter; sailed for Egypt with the
same reinforcement to the 12th, and joined
the regiment with him on Gallipoli. “Tibby”
died at Beersheba, as “L.H.” says: shot by
a Turk when he was dismounted and acting
as stretcher-bearer. He and I were stretcher-
bearers for the attack on Mageibra, the first
mounted action the 12th Regiment was in,
after Gallipoli had been left and the men
had regained their horses. “Tibby’s” regi-
mental number, by the way, was 924.
“Dalguise”:
The Beersheba charge was made by two
squadrons of the 4th L.H. and two squad-
rons of the 12th L.H., the latter of which had
“Tibby” Cotter in its ranks. Both these regi-
ments belonged to the 4th L.H. Brigade, com-
manded by Brigadier-General Grant, of Queens-
land. “Tibby” was killed by a machine-gun
bullet. He was brought in dead to the
dressing-station of the 4th Light Horse Field
Ambulance, then under the care of Major E. K.
Parry, M.C., now practising in N.S.W. One
of the squadron officers of the 12th Regiment
was C. L. A. Abbott, now M.H.R. for Gwydir.
A RHYME OF NEED.
Deai Bulletin —whose shrine august
Is found in George-street (252),
And haven of the scribblers’ trust
When things are looking extra blue—
All shakily my sins I rue;
Gloom is the portion, night and dawn,
Of one who cannot raise the due
To get his clobber out of pawn.
Pale ghosts of pristine pride pursue
My ragged steps along the street,
Fair-weather friends whom once I knew
And cheerfully was wont to greet
Now hurry on with nod discreet,
Their old-time heartiness withdrawn.
All would be changed if I could meet
The charge on clobber now in pawn.
Think not I’m throwing “biting” hints,
Nor how you’rq “holding” seek to know;
But through my dark despair there glints
A ray of hope that this may go
With quite sufficient metric flow
To save it from the basket’s yawn,
And earn me half a quid or so
To get my clobber out of pawn.

HOMFREY BEALE.


“B-Scale”: Don’t tell me Sydney
relief workers are drones. I have seen
six load a five-ton lorry in less than
a minute. The lorry was backed
against a sloping ledge in a quarry, just
below two huge boulders, which
lay one behind the other. Scorn-
ing tons of broken stone ready to be
loaded, the bright lads loosened the for-
ward boulder with a crowbar, and the
two slid on to the lorry, a thunderous
crash being the driver’s first knowledge
of the happening. No doubt the chaps
at the other end welcomed the pebbles
in good Australian.

“Sir Spen”: If it is not the close
season for election yarns let me in
with this account of a final rally
in a Ma State country town. A
team of abos. brought from a neighbor-
ing settlement were paraded through the
streets sporting white calico sashes on
which, in bold lettering, was the well-
worn legend “Lang Is Right.” In the
forefront strutted a grinning gin, all too
obviously approaching her time. Her
sash bore the inscription “Don’t Trust
Stevens!”
* * * *
“Black Mountain”: Stevens is no
squealer, whatever else he may be. Be-
fore the State dinner at Canberra the
man on the door was instructed that no
person, whatever his standing, was to be
allowed in unless he had his invitation
card. “Tubby” arrived without his and
was stopped. “I’m Stevens, Premier
of N.5.W.,” he protested. “That’s no
good to me,” the doorkeeper said—“no
ticket, no admittance.” Meanwhile, other
guests were passing in, and there were
sniggers at Stevens’s embarrassment.
After an uncomfortable five minutes he
appealed to a couple of policemen ; but
they couldn’t help: they were there
chiefly to eject gate-crashers. In the
end the predicament of the Premier
reached the ears of people inside, and he
was passed through, a stout and flustered
man. He soon cooled down, and, when
informed of the instructions issued to the
stern, unbending Cerberus, sent out a
message congratulating him on his fidelity
to his trust.
* * *
“Billy See”: Burying banknotes in
Kalgoorlie and Boulder backyards is
rather a risky procedure owing to the
intense salinity of the soil where con-
denser plants of the early days used
to operate, the hundreds of tons of salt
chipped from the boilers having dis-
solved into the earth. Bill Treglowan
won a cool £5O on the Boulder Cup a few
years ago, and, to keep his rather frugal
wife from putting pincher on the lot, he
buried the roll in a treacle tin in the
backyard. A little later he was offered
a good job outback and took it. Six
months passed and Bill returned home,
his eye fixed on a racing event which
would certainly turn his £5O into a couple
of hundred. Taking a spade in the dead
of night, Bill uncovered his cache, only
to find the tin crumbling with corrosion
and the notes reduced to rotten, almost
unrecognisable, paper. Broken by the
disaster, he flung the rubbish aside and
went to bed. Next morning his canny
wife gathered up the scraps and put in
a few hours with some warm water, some
tissue-paper and a pot of paste. Result,
50 one-pound notes which the bank duly
honored: 45 for the lady and five for
Bill, with strict injunctions to buy him-
self a new suit.

“M. Turlutu”: Surfing has an interest-
ing evolution. Four centuries ago all
nice people in Europe held that washing
in salt water was fit only for sailors, fish
and lunatics; in the more advanced mad-
houses lunatics were soused in sea water
as a cure. By 1812 or so sane people
were adopting the treatment, getting
themselves dipped in baskets, to avoid
risks from waves or currents. By 1824
“Can you see anything wrong with my costume?”
“Well, put it on, miss, an let’s ’ave a look.”
the Duchess of Berry, having learned to
swim—a most unusual accomplishment
for her rank in those days—decided to
make it fashionable. Clad in a neck-to-
ankle costume, with heavy woollen skirts
to keep inquisitive eyes from seeing too
much, she was led by the hand by a M.
le Directeur de la Plage de Dieppe knee-
deep into the waves. M. le Directeur
was clad in full evening dress and white
gloves. When the lady Considered her-
self afloat enough, her escort withdrew,
and a gun was fired to announce that she
was really in the water. She was con-
sidered rather fast, though, even for a
duchess.
“Broncho”: Buckjumpers, is it? I
was up for the annual show and races
at our C.Q. metropolis. I had a string
of hacks, hunters, pairs, tandems and
“Anyhow, you’ve never had lunch
with the boss!”
“No, but I’ve had breakfast with
him.”
fours, a buckjumper and a dfesire to be
joyful. I met a bank accountant, long of
body, nose, feet and thirst. He wore
a straw lid and a butterfly tie, and to-
gether we had a real good time. I was
called away hurriedly on the second day
of the show—the Hunters’ Plate was
about to commence, and I wanted it.
“Hey, Figures,” I called to my temporary
cobber. “Bring the rest of my horses
out to the grounds, will you?” I col-
lected the Hunters’ and continued enjoy-
ing myself, when the buckjumping com-
petition was announced. I looked for
Figures and my horses, but in vain, until
I saw a familiar straw lid above the
crowd and made for it. My pal was
on top of a horse, swaying with the
saddle-polishing swing of a mug rider.
His stilts of legs and his long feet draped
the horse’s ribs, and he whs riding about
nonchalantly while he looked for me.
And the horse on which he was mounted,
and which looked back at him in wonder
every now and again, was the outlaw
which I’d brought up to win the buck-
jumping contest with me aboard!
“Blurb”: The
winning of a big
lottery by a syn-
dicate recalls the
impassioned story
written round the
winner of the
first one of the
kind, a lady. A
gentleman on the staff of our yellowest
rag asked her to what she attributed her
good fortune. “She replied,” he wrote,
“that it was due to having wrapped a
silver lucky-pig charm in the documents
relating to the investment.” A gaudy
synonym for a lottery ticket.
“Lowland Scot”: The invisible mend-
ing illustration (B. 26/9/’34) set me
thinking of a Scotch lassie with a repu-
tation as a neat needlewoman to whom
I took a coat in which a hole had been
burned. “Aye, Ah can mend it brawly,”
she declared; “but tae mend th’ coat
ye’ll hae tae leave me your breeks.” I
suppose I looked alarmed —I had three
miles to get home. “No, no,” she ex-
plained, “it’s no’ for security; it’s tae
get threads o’ th’ same texture an’ color-
in’ as th’ coat tae mak’ a neat job.”
Pants sent. Result: indiscernible damage.
* * * *
“M.G.”: In the mass of early Mel-
bourne stuff which has flooded the
southern press of late, there has not been
one reference to one of the most pic-
turesque features of the gold-digging
days—the dance girls, or feminine
equivalent of the gigolo of to-day. Bal-
larat, Bendigo, Clunes and
itself had permanently employed in
every dance-hall a bevy of damsels
whose duty it was to act as part-
ners for the diggers able to pay
floorage. Many were gold-diggers
themselves, but there were a num-
ber who bore excellent reputations
and finished as the wives of well-known
and ultra-respectable citizens of the
southern city. One, who took her first
step up from the proletariat as a dance
girl at Rutherglen, became a society
leader, and finished as Lady So-and-so.
* :|: Si: St:
“Jack Sheppard”: The seal of Holly-
wood was stamped all over a Sydney boy
of 12 who was spoken to by a sergeant
about a car he was trying to drive
through heavy traffic. The man in blue
suggested an adjournment to the police
station. The youth confidentially hinted
that they should “get together” ; he had
a lot of influence, and it might be as
well for the bobby if the matter was
dropped. “Forget it,” was his peroration,
“and I’ll give you some money on Satur-
day.” Charges were preferred against
the imp, but, as it was a Children’s Court
matter, nothing more has been heard.
H=
“Coif”: I doubt whether even a French
jury would have saved Edith Thompson
(B. 31/10/’34). Her crime was hardly
one of passion in the ordinary sense.
She had free access to her ship-steward
lover whenever his P. and O. boat re-
turned to London, and there was little
protest by the husband. She had a good
job and no lack of money. What hanged
her and her paramour was the fact
that for many months she had tried
all sorts of methods to dispose of her
husband, and had written to her lover
full details of every unsuccessful attempt.
His mentality may be gauged by the fact
that he kept every one of the letters.
Finally she egged the fellow on, arrang-
ing that the job should be done with a
knife (this, too, was set down in writing)
while she was walking home from
the pictures with her husband. Bywater
came running in the darkness, stabbed
his man from behind, and vanished in
the night. There was nothing “chival-
rous” in his taking the blame for the
murder in view of that evidence. It was
just criminal flashness, like his last-
minute talk about football with the
warders.
* v ®
“Travel Stain”: Moreton Bay claims
to have the only man-made island on the
Australian coast. Bishop Island is a
popular holiday resort, but 25 years ago
it wasn’t there. In 1909 the Harbors and
Rivers Department decided that the in-
terests of shipping demanded a channel
across the mudflat which was uncov-
ered at low water in places. The channel
was to be 26ft. deep and 450 ft. wide, and
the dredged-up stuff was dumped into
the bay, to leave about 30 acres six feet
above high-water mark. It is cailed
Bishop Island after the skipper of the
dredge that dug the channel.

J. M. Fowler, ex-M.P., owns up:
Those pars, about Percy Brunton, “the Pea-
nut King,” remind me that I was largely respon-
sible for his adoption of the career which ended
so tragically. Thirty-five years ago Harry
Daglish and I were running a debating society
in Subiaco, a suburb of Perth. One night
members of the audience were invited to express
themselves on the subject under discussion. A
fresh-colored, sturdy lad, known to be appren-
ticed to a blacksmith, got up and made a capi-
tal little speech, for which I, as chairman,
complimented him, suggesting that he should
cultivate his apparent qualifications for public
life. Brunton, for he it was, took the advice
seriously, joined the debating society and lost
no opportunity of airing his eloquence. Ability
of a kind, an uncultured but vigorous power
of speech and an honest, well-meaning men-
tality might have carried him to the forefront
of politics but for some fatal lack of balance
which gradually reduced Percy to the position
of mountebank. I am afraid also I had a lot
to do with “Dag” turning politician. Though
he rose to the Premiership, public life killed
him. With those two regrets on my conscience
I lose no opportunity in these days to advise
young men to dig drains or hammer horseshoes
in preference to taking up politics.
GLOAMING.
A spinster is Gloaming—her fortune invested
In cloudbanks and shady concerns (I should
say).
Old maid of strict morals, stiff-backed and flat-
breasted !
Yet you kicked over traces and rules in your
day.
Your garments are sombre, and prim are your
manners;
You glance at our gambols with wintry, grey
eyes;
Yet, Gloaming, you’ve ridden with music and
banners
And star caballeros through blossoming
skies!
You flirted with sungods in primrose pavilions,
In Cumulus Castle by Skyline Lagoon;
I watched you weave archly through stately
cotillions,
As butler employed by his Highness the
Moon.
And once, when I brought to a dimly-lit grotto
A bottle of nectar and glasses for two,
On the knees of young Eros (indecently
“blotto”)
Was one —and I’m sorry to say it was you!
But now, Mistress Gloaming, your heartbeats
are slowing;
One ’d scarcely think butter could melt on
your tongue,
So staid and so stiff and so cold you are
growing
Who skylarked with sungods the skyline
along!
QUEENSLAND.

POLITICAL POINTS
Lang is an unquenchable optimist.
With only nine Langsters in the House
of Reps, and none in the Senate, he
is still promising his followers a “great
Labor victory” at the next Common-
wealth elections. All going well, he will
be 61 when they come off, and 65 before
“Labor” can possibly capture the
Senate—6B, perhaps, if P.R. arrives in
the meantime. And, tough as he is, re-
peated lickings and interminable rows
in which he is always in a temper must
tell on him.
Young Mr. Ogilvie’s first visit to Can-
berra as Tas. Premier was not a success.
He indulged in criticism of accounts
presented to the Loan Council by fellow-
Premiers and weighed in with an “in-
dependent” version of the discussions. He
was stingingly rebuked, particularly by
Forgan Smith, who said:
Budgets are subject to the closest scrutiny
by State Auditors-General and the Com-
monwealth Bank, and present a true picture
of the financial position. Mr. Ogilvie’s
allegations are a ridiculous caricature of
what took place.
Reporters will take care to be present
at the next meeting of these comrades.
In its first attempt at a depression
Budget Tas. Labor has put down another
£38,000 for social services (“including
unemployed relief and grants to medical
institutions”) and another £55,000 for
public servants, politicians included —the
equivalent of 50 per cent, of the financial-
emergency cut. There are more unem-
ployed than public servants, but the un-
employed vote is not concentrated or
organised.
Saying he would ne’er consent to take
Page into his Government as deputy-
leader, Lyons has consented. Thinking
A story without words.
to embarrass both, Scullin launched a
censure motion. A downier bird would
have waited ; it only accelerated their
agreement.
Premier Ogilvie’s first deficit is ex-
pected to amount to £207,700. Lee chal-
lenged his predecessor on the 50 per.
cent, restoration proposal, saying that it
would amount to £BO,OOO for a full year,
and that, although perhaps mentioned on
the hustings, the electors never dreamed
that it would include “an increase for
every Minister, every member and every
high official.” Amendment defeated.
There is much to cavil at in the finan-
cial performances of Westralian Labor,
but on one point it is refreshingly frank.
In a “Return relating to Railways,”
appended to the printed report of Mc-
Callum’s Budget speech, these lines
appear:
Deficiency, debited to consolidated
revenue, being burden on taxpayers,
£280,586.
In N. S. Wales a railway deficiency of
more than 12 times that size has been
hailed by the Stevens Government as a
brilliant achievement, and on the strength
of it “burden on taxpayers” has been
increased to provide pay-increases for
£lOOO-a-year men.
Raymond Leane, the S.A. Police Com-
missioner, had a great name in the A.1.F.,
but State Labor has never liked him. It
bitterly opposed a bill one clause of
which permits him to remain in office
“until the June 30 next after he has at-
tained the age of 65 years.” “How old
is the man?” one of its lions roared.
“Fifty-eight, I think,” Premier Butler
said. “I’m told he’s sixty,” growled
Labor-leader Lacey, who used to be
M.H.R. for Grey. Bean gives the correct
age and place of birth in his history:
“B. Prospect, Adelaide, July 12, 1878.”
Some of these local councils manage
their affairs far better than Governments
do theirs. For instance, Strathfield
(N.S.W.) expects to wind up the muni-
cipal year with a surplus, and the Gov-
ernment Statistician reports that its assets
exceed its liabilities by nearly £20,000.
Strathfield owes the Government no-
thing. “Sundry creditors, including loans
outstanding and interest,” figure in the
record at £5878.
It has been reported from Canberra
that city mayors not yet knighted will be
remembered when the Prince has gone,
and the gentlemen are all in a fluster
about it. Even Comrade Alf Jones, of
Brisbane, pricked up his ears when the
news was broken to him, and Alderman
Warmingpan, his deputy, said it would
be “a tribute to the dignity of the city.”
Perth’s Franklin got a mere C.M.G.
when that city had its centenary in 1929.
A step in rank is possible in his case,
but as a potentate who has fallen out
with his party Sydney’s Lord Mayor’s
chance of becoming Sir Something Some-
body is about ten million to one.
An anti-war congress is sitting in Syd-
ney to protest against the “plans of Im-
perial Powers to enter on a new war and
massacre.” The proceedings were not
opened with the singing of the Red Army
Air Force song, one verse of which,
roughly translated, runs:
Our engine’s roaring, roaring to the battle;
High in the air above the clouds we speed;
Our bombs are ready, our machine-guns rattle
Against the world’s imperialistic greed.
The McLachlan who headed the poll
at the S.A. Senate election is secretary
of the Stockowners’ Association, and
was a member of the State Pastoral
Board. He resigned from the board
when he became a candidate. The Gov-
ernment has reappointed him till the end
of the year. There has been some growl-
ing about this, but,.as the board has to
value and reallot leases that have fallen
in and as McLachlan has offered to. do
his share without pay, there is really
nothing to growl about. In any case, the
man can’t take his seat until July 1.
In three years to the end of 1933,
N.S.W. lost 18,000 people by excess
of emigration over immigration. Hems-
ley, M.L.C., gave one of the reasons in
criticising the bill “to abolish double
taxation” —it doesn’t. A man in N. S.
Wales drawing a nominal £lOO from
an English investment actually re-
ceives £77 10s., British income tax, 4s.
6d. in the £, being deducted at the source.
In N. S. Wales he is taxed lOd. in the £
on £125, it being presumed that he has re-
ceived the full £lOO and another £25 for
exchange even if he leaves the 111 10s.
in England. The British and Common-
wealth Governments have an arrange-
ment that neither will tax income taxed
by the other ; this N.S.W. ignores. So
the British tourist who can choose his
place of abode moves on.
One headline is kept “standing,” as
the printers say, in Lang’s newspaper
office:
The Fight Is On.
The other combatant may be Loughlin,
Scullin, Theodore, Collier, Richards,
Willis or Forgan Smith, but the party of
the first part is always the Boss. His
latest engagement has been with one
“Hold on a minute, coalie — I’m your
leader.”
Orr, secretary of the Miners’ Federation,
who treated him most disrespectfully:
We have had a visit from the author of
that famous novel “Why I Fight!”
Mr. Lang’s speeches resemble the gas
escaping from a deflated windbag.
Seemingly, Mr. Orr does not subscribe to
Mr. Garden’s opinion that Mr. Lang is
“greater than Lenin.”
Another by-election looms in Queens-
land ; G. P. Barnes, Opposition member
for Warwick, on the Darling Downs, is
relinquishing the seat. A. C. Morgan, son
of the Arthur Morgan who gave Labor
its first smell of office in Queensland by
taking Wully Kidston and Billy Browne
into his coalition Cabinet, is after it,
along with three others.
The secession delegates are getting
some encouragement in England from
Freetrade editors of the breed that re-
serves its love for ex-enemy countries
and Russia, and (being pacifist) goes look-
ing for fight everywhere else. This was
to be expected, but it is queer to find a
paper like the “Observer” taking them
seriously. It is quoted as saying that the
Commonwealth Act provides for separa-
tion via Canberra and a Commonwealth
referendum. It does nothing of the
kind. It declares in its first sentence that
the Australians
Have agreed to unite in one indissoluble
Federal Commonwealth under the Crown
and under the Constitution.
A Constitution that provided for its own
destruction would be a crazy piece of
work.
After a long-drawn-out' inquiry into
the administration of Maoriland’s Native
Affairs by Apirana Ngata, a Royal Com-
mission has reported that the Auditor-
General’s complaints of financial irregu-
larities and muddle were in 80 instances
justified. Ngata has resigned. A pity,
for no Native Minister had a better
influence on the Maoris. His dream was
to establish them as farmers, and in
that direction he was having a fair
measure of success.
Paddy McGirr, the Lang-Labor
M.L.C., has been sued by the Forbes
Council for failure to sewer a terrace
of seven houses. His solicitor admitted
that the McGirr is “a \big property
owner,” but pleaded that the times are
hard on big property owners and that
the terrace brings in a mere 12s. 6d. a
week per house. Two or three days
later Minister Buttenshaw casually men-
tioned that this Labor landlord, ap-
pointed chairman of the Western Lands
Commission by Lang and removed by
Stevens, had been paid £2OOO, and two
colleagues £lOOO each, “pending finalisa-
tion of their claims.” Such is N.S.W.
politics.
The gentlemen controlling the Irish
sweeps nominated a ’plane for the cen-
tenary air race. When a certificate was
refused on the ground of overloading,
they swore it was a Saxon plot to prevent
a Celtic victory, and a Nazi newspaper
backed them up. It was announced that
the pilot would load her up to his liking
and knock chunks off Scott’s time to
Melbourne. He tried twice, but had to
return to the ’drome, and now the
achievement has been postponed indefi-
nitely—until repairs are effected in
America. Hitherto the Saxon has sup-
plied most of the money for the sweeps,
and a lot, incidentally, for Mr. de
Valera’s exchequer ; but he is apt to be
touchy when his sportsmanship is
assailed.
In income and wages taxes Tasmania
collected £523,700 last year, but “lottery
prizes” accounted for £162,500 of it, an
increase of £33,500 for the year. The
lottery tax is mostly paid by mainlanders.
The Commonwealth formerly had a 12j
per cent, lottery tax of its own, but
waived it to help Tasmania, a concession
of which Queensland, N.S.W. and W.A.
have since availed themselves. The
Commonwealth was foolishly generous.
The peasant Government of Lithuania
has fired a shot which may be heard
round the world:
To dispose of surplus geese the Govern-
ment at Kovno is forcing civil servants
It’s Percy’s potato month.
to buy a goose for every £2 of monthly
salary.
A really brilliant idea. And nobody is
obliged to eat the goose—or the wheat,
beef, mutton, vegetables, bananas or
treacle, as the case may be.
From a returned-soldier in Fiji:
Two arresting events in the relations between
Australia and Fiji: (1) Kingsford Smith flies
from Brisbane to Suva in less than 12 hours.
(2) On the motion of J. P. Bayly, member for
the Western Division, the Fiji Leg. Council
resolves that discriminating taxation be levied
on all purchases and imports from Australia
until Australia ceases to discriminate against
imports of Fiji bananas. This means that
unless Australia moderates its attitude towards
Fiji all our buying will be diverted to England,
Canada and Maoriland. Last year, in round
figures, Fiji bought from Australia goods
worth over £400,000 Australian, and sold Aus-
tralia re-exports deducted about £25,000
worth. Thus, while modern machines bring
Fiji to Australia’s doorstep, the two countries
may be poles apart in trade.

ITEMS
Kingsford Smith has done it again.
With P. G. Taylor as navigator, he has
flown from Australia to North America
in three hops: Brisbane (his birthplace)
to Suva, 12 hours; to Honolulu, 25
hours 3 minutes ; to Oakland, 14 hours
59 minutes ; total, 52 hours 2 minutes.
This should silence, for a time, the de-
tractors who whispered that the air pilot’s
pilot was getting too old for trans-
oceanic work. He is not 38 yet—young
enough to be Stodart’s son.
Bob Menzies, who made a hit with
his first speech in the House of Reps., is
off to London presently to conduct a case
before the Privy Council. He took the
brief long before he stood for Kooyong.
It might be a risky move if there were a
rival with strong claims to the Priminis-
terial succession, but there is none.
Tom Paterson, deputy leader of the
Country party, will join W. M. Hughes
on the immigrants’ bench when he be-
comes a Minister. He is an Englishman
who arrived in Australia in 1908 and
took a mere 14 years to get into Parlia*
ment. He doesn’t look or talk like the
farmer he is. His recreations are not
farmers’ recreations either —golf and
carpentering.
STEWART HOWARD, who has written
a fine novel for the Endeavour Press.
Dead in Adelaide, at 51, Roy Taylor,
S.A.’s best tennis player for a long
period; he also played for Australia
against Canada at lacrosse. Like his
father, he was a member of the old
James Marshall firm; when Myers
bought them out the younger partners
all turned to sharebroking.
Malcolm MacDonald, who has been
renewing his impressions of Queensland,
this time as Parliamentary Under-Secre-
tary to the Dominions Office, has a lot in
common with his father. He is like him
in looks ; he was born at Lossiemonth,
and he shares the same address —10
Downing-street. But, though the son was
educated at Oxford and the sire at a
board school, dad has the more polished
diction. The Prime Minister is 68 ; the
Under-Secretary 33.
Captain J. G. Arnold, who has taken
on the contract of salvaging the cargo
and fittings of the motor-ship Victoria,
wrecked near Porpoise Head (S.A.), is
a well-known figure in river transport.
His headquarters are at Mannum, where
the stump-jump ploughs came from, and
his vessels were trading on the Murray
and Darling long before the railways
commenced to steal the trade. Some
years ago he set out in his yacht The
Four Winds to circumnavigate Australia,
but the craft came to grief on the Vic-
torian coast. Given good weather, he
expects the salvage job to last three
or four months.
The man responsible for the Mel-
bourne “lollysticks,” ridiculed by many
but admired by most when they were
properly illuminated, is Eddie Billson, an
architect of the younger school. Bill-
son, the son of an ex-Speaker of Vic.
Assembly, was the first architectural
student of Melbourne University, and,
among other achievements, was in the
first half-dozen in the world-wide com-
petition for the “Tribune” Building,
Chicago. The “Tribune” people an-
nounced that they intended to erect the
world’s finest building, and the design
which Billson submitted went very close
to the winner’s.
Stewart Howard, pictured here by Aria
in a state of extreme meditation, belongs
to the try-anything-once
order of Australians. As
far as is known, he has
never appeared profession-
ally in a pulpit or on a
hearse, but he is suspected
of having done most other
things, from selling jute to
running newspapers. His
latest effort is a novel called
“Forty-six,” done by the En-
deavour Press ; the story of
a chap of that age who has
got himself tangled in a net
of women and faces the
problem of getting out
again. An experiment in
narrative form, compress-
ing the action of a lifetime
into four actual days, the
novel demonstrates How-
ard’s versatility. It is a seri-
ous effort, completely dif-
ferent from his boisterous
earlier book, “You’re Tell-
ing Me.” Howard is a
fourth-generation Austra-
lian, born at Balmain, Sydney. He took
in education at Fort-street High, and as
a Sydney Uni. night student. At present
he edits a weekly comic paper, with,
behind him, the heroic record of 10
years’ freelance journalism in Sydney.
Brisbane had no better-known or
better-liked medical man than Dr. R. A.
Meek, dead at 65. He was a notable
surgeon, but never specialised, preferring
to carry on general practice. Victorian-
born, he graduated at Melbourne Uni.
and later went to the staff of Brisbane
General Hospital; illness compelled his
retirement 12 months ago. During the war
he was a naval surgeon for a period, and
for years after the Armistice he worked
his head off at Kangaroo Point Military
Hospital. Dr. Meek had a huge private
practice, much of it among people from
whom he refused to take payment—he
was like that. His chief relaxation was
racing, and he was for years a familiar
figure at Q.T.C. meetings.
Douglas Mawson, who has been ap-
pointed president-elect of the 1935 ses-
sion of the A. and N.Z. Association for
the Advancement of Science, should
know something about the subject. Doc-
tor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering
and Professor in Geology and Miner-
ology at Adelaide Uni., he is better
known for his ramblings round the South
Pole. He has paid three visits to the
pepguins, and is probably feeling a little
homesick for the snow now, as he hasn’t
been down there since 1931. Trifles
that he has picked up in addition to his
knighthood, a Fellowship of the Royal
Society and an 0.8. E. include medals
from Britain, U.S.A., France, Germany
and Italy.
Major E. G. (Ted) Clark, who is
bringing an air joyriding circus to Aus-
tralia, made a great hit
after the war by running
a similar show during the
summer at the Lancashire
seaside resorts. He was a
flyer himself, but a bad
motor smash in London,
which brought him back
to Australia in search of
health, practically made
him a permanent cot
case ; he continues to run
his affairs from an in-
valid’s carriage. One of
a western Queensland
family noted for their
superb horsemanship, he
went to South Africa with
the sth Q. 1.8. Remaining
there, he saw service in
the Zulu rising of 1906
in which he was badly
wounded, and later against
the Boer rebels and the
Germans in West Africa.
After that he travelled via
Egypt with the South
African Brigade to France,
the force being diverted
to Libya for a couple of
months to help deal with
the Senussi’s forces. Then
to France for more
wounds and the D.S.O.
The Melroses, of South Aus. :

The family has been rooted in the pastoral
soil of S.A. for nearly a century. (As Ross
Smith used to say: “The best place to learn
to fly is gn a horse.”) The aviator’s relative
John, knighted in ’2B, after he had endowed the
Agricultural Research Department in the Waite
Institute, is head of the. clan; he has been
blind since 1901, but this has never hampered
his operations or sapped his courage. He
has been on Ulooloo, about 125 miles north
of Adelaide, since 1884, and has made a
wonderful station of it, worthy of its name—
the war-cry and hunting-call of the interior
and northern natives. A noted breeder, he
imported the first Dorset and Wensleydale
sheep and the first Percheron stallion and
mares. He has been a councillor of Hallett
shire for 50 years, and, despite huge bene-
factions to charity and research, is still well
endowed with this world’s, goods. His son
Aleck is the leading Percheron breeder in Aus-
tralia, takes a healthy interest in public affairs,
and has been M.H.A. for Burra Burra since
last year. He married a daughter of John
Lewis of B.H.P. Another member of the
family has been a Bulletin for many
endow a Melrose 10 ° r ° in " Un S
Sydney gas, and Hobart loses, a
rather remarkable young man in P. C.
Grennland. With literary gifts and
.7 . .
organising ability, he was secretary of
Adelaide University Union and of its
Sports Association and editor of its
magazine ; then, only this year, he went
to Tas. as Uni. tutor and secretary of the
W E.A. He comes to Sydney as secre-
tary of Sports; he will also run the
combined Sports Association ot the
Australian Universities.
The other side:
It is incorrect and unfair to suggest (B.
31/10/’34) that no one bothered to send an
urgent cable to the bereaved parents of Gilman
and Baines, killed in the air race. Both had
given an English address. Informed of the
crash by the liaison officer in London, the Mel-
bourne authorities tried to get in touch with
the relatives. Defence, Wellington, was asked
by urgent cable to convey the sympathy of the
committee, and the cablegram has been pub-
lished.
“Dragoon” on a versatile soldier:
Alexander Hore-Ruthven, son of the eighth
Lord Ruthven of Gowrie, who will leave Eng-
land to take up the Governorship of N. S. Wales
on December 14, ought to be at home here,
especially with the A.I.F. He has lived in Aus-
tralia nearly a decade—the first half on Lord
Dudley’s staff before the war, the second as
Governor of S. Australia. He is the first
V.C. New South Wales has had as Governor,
and his military experience has been versatile.
He discarded the tartan of the Highland Light
Infantry to command a Camel Corps in Soudan
in ’98 —it was at Gadaref that he won his cross
—reverted to kilts when he joined the Cameron
Highlanders, switched to the Ist Dragoon
Guards, and went to France with the Welsh
Guards in ’l5. There, though over 40, he
was in the thick of the scrap and came out
with a severe wound, a D.S.O. and bar, a
C. 8., a C.M.G. and five mentions in dispatches.
PARMENTIER, the new Flying Dutchman.
He commanded the regiment for four years
after the war, and then the Ist Infantry
(Guards) Brigade until he went to S.A. His
two brothers have both been Colonels of
crack regiments—one of the Scots Guards, the
other of the Black Watch. All three are
D.S.Os. and have commanded brigades.
Brig.-Gen. J. R. Royston, C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., guest of the Bth L.H. at Mel-
bourne’s centenary, and “Galloping
Jack” to them all, is coming on to Syd-
ney next week. It’s 55 years since Roy-
ston became a soldier. A schoolboy in
Natal, he wanted to fight the Zulus. His
father said he couldn’t, so he took his
pony and joined the troops on the
march. Sir Evelyn Wood happened to
see him and sent him back ; he sneaked
in again and was again sent back. Then
he swam his pony across a river above
the column; the current carried him
down, and he ran into Wood once more.
This time he was allowed to join the
Scouts. He had become an officer before
the campaign was over.
Padre Paul, of Camden (N.S.W.), is
back from a trip abroad. He has been
25 years in Australia —except for the
period when he was soldiering in France
and Egypt. He got a commission on the
field. After the war he went to Oxford
(his college was Merton) took orders,
and returned to Australia.
A familiar figure will vanish from the
Sydney waterfront when Major G. D.
Ross, of the passenger department of
the Union Co., retires at the end of the
year. Young as he looks, Major Ross
is approaching his ,65th year. He and
three of his sons served in the Great
War, and the four came back with deco-
rations.
The law runs in families as no other
profession does. Five sons and a daugh-
ter of the late G. F. A. Jones, barrister
and solicitor, of Richmond (Vic.), are
practitioners of the Vic. Supreme Court.

TYRE
Barnet Glass “Checkskid” is a tyre designed especially for today’s
gruelling traffic conditions —of high speed travel over harder*
smoother road surfaces.
Its extra breadth of tread, which contains more actual rubber, gives
extra road grip . . . extra safety . . . extra mileage. Its extra
depth of tread gives longer non-skid tyre-life . . . increased
economy . . . immunity from skids and slipping.
In Barnet Glass “Checkskid,” you also get the advantages of
heat resisting design, which reduces the tendency to generated
heat, the main cause of tyre destruction; unique carcase
construction, which gives extra sidewall flexibility; and superimposed
buttresses which strengthen the shoulders and support this new
“more-rubber” tread.

The table is a testimony to the skill and
zeal of the management, and the sup-
port, financial and otherwise, of the
Barrier cos. in building up an industry
which in pre-war days was mainly in the
hands of Germany and German-controlled
plants in Belgium. Though slump upset
a run of 12 p.c. divs., and other things,
the co. has been able to replace most
of the business lost in Europe by in-
creased sales in Australia, Japan and
India. As costs were lowered, prices
strengthened and earnings responded.
The pref.’s slate has been cleaned, and
the ords., who faded out of the picture
in 1931, got back again on September 7
with a 4 p.c. div. Owing to the recent
fall in the price of the spelter there is
some doubt as to what further distribu-
tion, if any, they are likely to receive
during the current term.
For the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts average metal prices
were a little stronger and production of
metals was slightly lower. The apparent
slip of £22,934 in profits was due to a
contraction of £34,355 in the net addi-
tion to the reserve for depreciation, etc.
(now £1,810,043). This addition is in-
cluded with profits in the table and then
shown as w’ritten off. Leaving it out of
the reckoning, but including other re-
serve adjustments, the net result was
£11,421 better at £233,145, equal to a
wink under 9 p.c. on the £2,600,000 of
capital, of which £1,500,000 carries a
minimum 8 p.c., with the right to ad-
vance beyond that point with the ords.
By arrangement with the Zinc Cartel,
which has kept world production of the
metal pegged around 50 p.c. of plant
capacity, practically full-scale output has
been maintained at Risdon, though this
has involved substantial payments for
excess tonnage:

The co. now sells half its total output of
zinc locally as against about 40 p.c. a
year ago, thanks to increased activity
in the galvanising industry and the call
for zinc dust in cyaniding auriferous ores.
Higher-grade concentrates from the Bar-
rier resulted in further contraction in the
silver and lead residues.
The liquid position improved, despite
net additions totalling £56,951 to the
book value of mines and plant, mainly

Including stocks (down £110,314) but not
shares, the more or less liquid surplus
(£496,812) was £47,292 stronger than at
the previous balance. The growth in
the plant item suggests that the co. is
going ahead with extensions at Ris-
don which were interrupted about five
years back. With the fall in prices and
restricted overseas markets, the outlook
at Rosebery is more uncertain than it
was a year ago ; still, the co. is ready to
start up here as soon as opportunity
offers.
Since the price of spelter last week-
end (London spot quote was £l2 11s.)
was about £3 below last year’s average,
and about 30s. below the minimum at
which the co. has contracted to buy zinc
concentrates from the Barrier, it has
been hit both ways. Also, competition
may lead to a reduction of the premium
(about £2 10s. a ton) which the co. has
been able to get on high-grade spelter.
On the market the ords. dropped 2s.
last week. At 255. the return would be
4.8 p.c. on a 6 p.c. distribution. The
prefs. at 365. 4d. return 4.8 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div.

This is the holding co. through which
J C. Hutton and Foggitt Jones, the well-
known ham, bacon and food-canning
people, who own nine factories in Aus-
tralia and a subsidiary in Maoriland,
amalgamated their interests in 1927. At
Sept. 30 last its £1,400,000 of capital
(£450,000 of it carries a cumulative 8
p.c.), together with a handful of reserves,
was represented by shares in the two
operating cos., £1,355,008 (cost), and
£70,988 of advances, etc. The price
paid for the scrip of the pair (com-
bined face value £716,700) included
£638,308 for reserves, of which £463,000
were inner reserves, disclosed by a re-
valuation of the assets. Thus no good-
will figured in the deal.
For the three years preceding the
merger net earnings of the two cos. com-
bined averaged £131,043 p.a. But slump
and competition, especially the latter,
have cut so deeply into earnings that pay-
ments to the prefs. were 3 p.c. behind
when the books last closed, and the ords.
have been shown an empty basket for
the last four years.
Here is a comparison of the combined
p. and 1. figures of the two operating
cos.: —•

Divs. . . . . 127,335 36,0.00 22,500 36,000
During the last term gross earnings im-
proved £6089, though they were less than
half the 1928 figure. That was after
allowing for a loss of £9131, mainly in
connection with stocks, in one of the
offshoots. Exes, were up £8174, due
to additional allowances of £8421 for
depreciation (£24,944) and of £3500 for
taxation (£11,500). The net result was
2.8 p.c. on the combined capitals
(£716,700) as against 3,4, 3.4, 15.7, 16.5
and 19.2 p.c. back to 1928. Still, £36,000
was distributed. To enable the United
Co. to pay its own pref. div. and 3 p.c.
on its ord. capital, the operating cos.
would need to pay 9 p.c. on their com-
bined capitals, or less than half the
amount netted in 1928.
There is nothing to worry about in
the finances:

To wipe out the overdraft (£64,551 at
the previous balance), clip £7569 off the
amount coming to sundry creditors, and
strengthen cash, etc., by £20,785, the
book value of fixed assets was reduced
by £33,063 and stocks by £62,259. The
growth in shareholdings, etc., and reduc-
tion in debtors’ balances was due to a
book adjustment in connection with
advances to subsidiaries. The more or
less liquid surplus (£115,541) improved
£18,509.
The market prices the United Co.’s
prefs. at 265. as against 19s. 3d. a year
ago. The return at the higher figure is
6.1 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis. The
ords. at 9s. would return 6.6 p.c. on a
3 p.c. distribution. On the basis of the
subsidiaries’ free reserves, the net tan-
gible cover is approximately £2 prefs.
and 9s. ords. In addition, there is the
provision for depreciation (£131,417) and
for taxation and contingencies (£38,668).

ings in respect of £19,048,865 (up
£898,220) of trust business in hand when
the books closed, together with some
agency pickings. There was definite im-
provement in the letting of properties,
both business and residential, and in the
collection of rents and mortgage interest,
the chairman says. Still, the year’s gross
earnings from all sources were £520
lighter:

But the bigger business was handled at
£770 less cost, thanks to a little relief
from taxation. After striking £6OO off
the book value of premises, the net
result was £250 better at 8.1 p.c. on
capital as against 7.9, 8.3, 10.6, 14 and
14.1 p.c. back to 1929. The div. was
kept at 6 p.c., equal to 3.8 p.c. on capi-
tal and reserves combined.
On the market the £5 shares paid to
11s. are steady at 16s. 9d., at which
figure the return is 3.9 p.c. on a 6 p.c.
div. basis. The net tangible cover is
17s. 2d.
Apart from the possibilities of Gov-
ernment interference, the future of these
trustee cos. looks as assured as any-
thing of the kind can look these days.
Complicatons associated with the ad-
ministration of estates is sending more
business into their care, and the con-
tinued growth of this one’s trust funds
enhances prospects of a bit better than 6
p.c. for shareholders in the future.

This co., which manufactures most of
its own requirements, does a large whole- (
sale trade in motor accessories, bicycles,
radios, etc. For the four years after the
public became interested in 1926, enough
was netted to pay 8 p.c. on £74,800 of
pref. money and then show an average
of 9.3 p.c. on ord. capital. With the
change in conditions, the business began
to look sick ; a loss of £23,902 showed
up in 1931. But the board used enough
of the right medicine, and net earnings
have now regained their old vigor. A cut
of ss. per share (£53,035) was made in the
ords., reducing paid capital to £233,905
in 74,800 £1 prefs. and 212,140 ords. of
15s. each. That wiped out the p. and 1.
debit, together with £27,500 of goodwill
(now £16,000, not treated as an asset-
herein). The organisation was over-'
hauled, outlets were stopped up and
headway was made on the manufacturing
side, especially in radio receivers and in
push-bikes, the line on which the busi-
ness was founded nearly 40 years ago.
During the last term an all-round im-,
provement in turnover, and further sav-
ings following greater efficiency in manu-
facture, enabled the co. to more than
double its net earnings, which were suffi-
cient to pay the prefs. their £5984, and
show 11.3 p.c. on ord. capital as against
2.7 p.c. and 1 p.c. for the two preced- 1
ing years. The div., which was lifted
from 4d. to Is. per share, doesn’t look
like being disturbed during the current
term.
The year’s brisker trading is further
reflected in balance-sheet figures:

the overdraft, the co. added only £17,395
to the amount coming to trade and other

the improvement in the more or less

table represents the allowance for depre-
ciation, etc—£3o,ooo for each of the last
two years. Most of the spring of
£106,790 in last year’s figure came from
savings totalling 3s. 5.4 d. a ton in mining,
development and milling costs. Bigger
production, better recoveries and sales
and a small increase in the average Lon-
don price of metals accounted for the
balance. The exchange premium, which
appears to have been responsible for
roughly three-quarters of the profit from
mining, was steady at £25 per cent. The
spring in sales plus products on hand
(£792,721) was £172,899. Mine expendi-
ture (£532,832) increased by £29,675, and
administrative exes., etc. (£65,128), by
£23,444, while returns from the
£1,339,855 of cash (£321,139) and other
investments outside the business (mostly
in allied industries) were £12,990 lighter
at £98,594, or 2s. 9.8 d. per share. The
net return from all sources was thus Bs.
Bd. per share (up 35.); ss. 6d. of it was
distributed, and another 2s. 6d. was paid
on Sept. 28.
During the year 81,885 tons more crudes
was raised at an average of Is. 4.6 d. per
ton less cost, thanks to the new shaft, put
down to quicken and cheapen ore extrac-
tion from the lower levels at the north-
ern end of the mine. Haulage through
this shaft began on March 1, 1933, from
1850 ft.; it is now down 2207 ft. and
equipped to 2000 ft. The stone, which
assayed 15.2 p.c. lead, 9oz. silver and
10.8 p.c. zinc, contained a trifle more
lead and silver, but a bit less zinc:— -

The bigger tonnage gave the new fine-
grinding section and flotation units, cap-
able of handling 50,000 tons of crudes
monthly, more of an opportunity to show
what they could do, and milling costs
were lowered by Is. 7.8 d. a ton.
Milling performances over the last five
years compare as follows:
Ore ( —Concentrates — ,
Treated, f Lead , Zinc

1934.. 395,577 76,810 74.8 „ 67,180 53.3 „
The outstanding feature is the marked
improvement in the grade of lead con-
centrate. Recoveries, too, have ad-
vanced from 92.9 p.c. lead, 83.3 p.c.
silver and 76.8 p.c. zinc in 1929 to 95.5
p.c. lead, 88.6 p.c. silver and 83.7 p.c.
zinc for the last term.
Over the last five years £334,412
(£24,144 of it was in respect of the last
term) has been spent on mine and plant,
which now figure at £1,394,188, and
£175,100 has been invested in a central
power plant as well. The outlay has
lengthened the life of the mine and in-
creased the profit' from treatment of ore
at the low metal prices now ruling.
Ore reserves remain unchanged at
3,500,000 tons in the North, 800,000 tons
British and 200,000 tons Junction sec-
tion. The demand for and prices of
metals did not warrant resumption of
work in the two last-named sections.
Including shares in other cos., the
financial position further improved:

Liabilities . . 132,687 75,381 117,422
Net liquid assets £1,570,283 £1,559,249 £1,645,959
Shareholders are thus £75,676 better off
than they were in 1928, notwithstanding
the outlay on mine and plant meanwhile.
The 41,998 tons of lead on hand when
the books closed were taken into account
at £l2 10s., Australian currency. Last
week-end the London price was £lO 13s.
9d., and for silver Is. ll|d. The market
prices the pound shares at 955., at which
figure the return would be 6.3 p.c. on the
basis of a 6s. distribution.
J. and A. Brown and Abermain Sea-
ham Collieries (N.S.W.), which merged
the interests indicated in the title, to-
gether with those of East Greta, about
three years ago, netted £48,386 (down
£1724) for the 12 months to June 30 last,
and a 2j p.c. div. took £47,500 of it.
After being held by the Brown interests
for over 30 years, the contract for the
supply of coal to the Australian Gas
Light Co. will pass to Hetton Bellbird
at the end of this year. The quantity
involved is about 370,000 tons. This loss
has been largely offset by a new 12-'
months’ contract, from Sept. 30 last, with
the N. S. Wales Government Railways
for 200,000 tons and 50,000 tons of large
coal at 10s. 3d. and 10s. 6d. a ton respec-
tively, and 50,000 tons of small coal at Bs.
10d. Because of this the market still looks
upon the show as an immediate 2j p.c.
proposition, on which basis the pound
shares at 7s. 9d. return 6.4 p.c. When
the books closed fixed assets and invest-
ments, etc., figured at £2,112,386 ;
debtors, £100,990; cash, £lll5. Includ-
ing something for the taxgatherer, there
is £58,245 coming to trade creditors and
£200,000 to debenture-holders.

The £128,750 of capital—l2s,ooo £1
ords. and 75,000 deferreds of Is. each —
in Alluvial Gold’s Maoriland offshoot,
Barrytown Gold Dredging, was quickly
taken. The selected area, long known to
contain payable values but only recently
declared available for mining, consists of
784 acres, containing 22,000,000 c.y., with
a maximum depth of 40ft. and a minimum
of 10ft., estimated to average lOd. a
yard with gold at £6 an ounce. The
yardage could be increased by the pur-
chase of contiguous properties, which the
board does not at the moment recom-
mend. The dredge, which will have a
capacity of at least 200,000 c.y. a month,
is scheduled to set in about the end of
1935. Working costs are not expected to
exceed £1750 a month, while the average
yield should approximate £7500, again
with gold at £6 an ounce. The difference
between this and the present price of
the metal (about £8 13s. an ounce in
Maoriland) is considered ample to cover
royalty and income-tax payments. On
the basis of estimates, carefully made,
shareholders can thus see over nine years’
work ahead for one dredge, with surplus
earnings sufficient to repay the whole of
the share capital and show 51 p.c. p.a.
thereon as well. -

Peak Gold Mines is about to be
formed in Sydney to take over from E.
A. Campbell a number of leases, total-
ling about 320 acres and embracing the
main lines of reefs at Cobar (N.S.W.).
It is proposed to develop and equip the
Brown Lode and Conqueror mines at the
Peak, and to later examine the Silver
Peak and Lady Graves lines of lode in
the same vicinity ; also to investigate the
possibilities of the northern continuation
of the Occidental-Chesney make of stone,
which recent developments at the New
Occidental suggest may be worth atten-
tion. Subject to capitalisation, vendors’
consideration, etc., particulars of which
have not yet been sent out, the areas in
question have possibilities which appear
to be well worth testing. In 1911, after
Longworth’s Great Cobar Syndicate gave
up—nothing under 15dwt. was consid-
ered worth while in those days—E. C.
Andrews, then Government Geologist of
N. S. Wales, said, “In such a faulted area
as that contained in the Brown and Con-
queror lodes, the whole rock mass is
shattered, and may be considered as a
low-grade auriferous lode which might
pay to work under existing metallurgical
methods.” Since then, recovery methods
have advanced considerably, and the
price of gold has more than doubled in
Australian currency. For the 20 years
to 1931, tributors on the Peak areas
gouged out 2895 tons, averaging 3yOZ.
of gold and heavy in silver ; the lot worth
£56,606. The mass of the low-grade stuff,
—a lot of it assays sdwt. to 6dwt.—has
been left, and values are said to improve
toward water level, about 270 ft. down.
Both George Blakemore and G. J. Gray
(they were respectively general manager
and chief surveyor at Great Cobar) also
consider that further prospecting at the
Peak offers possibilities.

Further boring of the Melawi Gold
Syndicate’s Alluvia area in Dutch West
Borneo by George More has disclosed
about 500 acres estimated to contain
17,400,000 c.y. of sd. dirt and 32,260,000
c.y. averaging 3d., with gold at 85s. an
ounce. The vendor is asking £l4 an
acre, or 30 p.c., of the promoters’ gross
profit on sale, payable in cash or half
cash and half shares at Melawi’s option.
It was originally thought that a much
bigger area would average three grains;
costs were put at 2£d. a yard, and the
gold is 84.6 p.c. pure. A channel has
been traced for a further \\ miles ; here
some boring is necessary to protect titles.
Meanwhile, Mr. More is returning to
Australia to consult the board of Oriomo
Explorations, Melawi’s managing agents.

After a preliminary reconnaissance of
Guinea Gold’s new properties in the
Lakiekamu district of Papua and the
Mandated Territory, Placer’s technical
staff has recommended an extensive
drilling campaign. Two complete plants,
together with the necessary personnel,
are now on the way, and are scheduled
to be in full swing on the Babuan areas
by the end of this month. It may be
six months or thereabouts before full
reports as to yardages, values, etc., are
submitted by the co.’s supervising engin-
eers. Meanwhile, Nanson Jones will con-
tinue his geological exploration of
additional areas.

N.Q. Gold Mines Development is
vigorously pushing ahead with prospect-
ing work on its concession at The Oaks.
Thousands of feet and thousands of
samples have been cut, but results are
kept watertight. Officials, however, are
fairly optimistic, and the extent and
continuity of the work suggest that what-
ever encouragement there has been is
maintained. It is probable that some
million of tons, averaging a shade over
2dwt. gold, and at present that means
roughly 16s. per ton, can be quarried
almost for a song under the right scheme.
Combined costs not exceeding 9s. should
be possible, for the stuff is all near the
surface. But The Oaks has never had
a real water supply, and that will be
one of the first things requiring attention.
* * * *
Gravel sluicing for alluvial gold on
the rich old Palmer field (N.Q.) should
be under way during the wet season. A
road has been made from Chillagoe, and
heavy machinery can now be got on to the
ground. W. Berry went up some months
ago to do extensive drilling. Presum-
ably results were right; 200 tons
of machinery is going forward. The
tested areas represent old river beds,
much above the level of the stream
that Walter Baker is dredging. Many
years ago R. L. Jack formed a good
opinion of the possibilities of the older
gravels in the Palmer district.
* * * *
Lake View’s three interim divs., plus
a fourth and final of 12| p.c. and a
bonus of p.c., mean a total disburse-
ment for the year ended June 30 last
of about £322,000 on its £560,000
of paid capital. An interim of
p.c. on account of the current year puts
a further £70,000 in shareholders’
pockets. The co.’s mines look well, but,
since the management doesn’t broadcast
much information, very little is heard
about them. The annual report will be
issued and the annual meeting held
within the next few weeks.
* * * *
During the yqar to March 31 last,
Wiluna (W.A.) added 253,900 tons to
its ore reserves, raising the figure to
1,786,000 tons, averaging 28s. 6d., with
gold at 84s. an ounce. A year earlier
the figure was 31s. 6d. But the loss in
this respect will be more than offset by
savings in costs, following bigger crush-
ings and better recoveries, and, probably,
a higher average price for gold.
* * * *
London-controlled Westralian gold-
mining cos. have readily agreed to the
proposed tax on profits, and other pro-
ducers don’t seem to be the least per-
turbed about it. As Deputy-Premier
Alex. McCallum explained in Parlia-
ment, the expected maximum proceeds
from the tax (£BO,OOO or, roughly, 6 p.c.
on profits) are a mere bagatelle compared
with what the S. African Government
gathers. The aim is to compensate the
State for miners’ pthisis payments.

An announcement was recently made
in more than one London financial paper
that, after careful consideration of bor-
ing and sampling results, Gt. Boulder
Prop, had abandoned its option over the
old White Hope mine at Hampton Plains
(W.A.). This is denied by an Adelaide
co. which has just been floated to work
the property. Boulder’s manager, Jack
Warrick, says that the co. transferred its
option for a financial consideration, and
adds that the drill disclosed payable ore
of fair width at a depth of 300 ft., with
geological conditions favorable.

Results from South Kalgurli’s boring
on the old. Robinson mine, Kanowna
(W.A.), fell short of expectations.
Instead of solid payable quartz being
stabbed only barren or low-value
stringers were struck. No further ex-
penditure on the property is to be in-
curred. The co. is now prospecting a
show at Wombola, 20 miles south-east
of Kalgoorlie, and has exposed pay-
able ore at shallow depths.

Kanowna Pug Co. (W.A.), which is
testing a process for the treatment of a
large deposit of sticky stuff, struggles
on. The latest report is that a little has
been cleaned up for a 4|dwt. return, but
it is doubtful whether that average can
be maintained.

The arrangement Swan Bitter (W.A.)
has with Mt. Morgan, Ltd., stipulates
that, in the event of the option being
exercised, the purchase consideration
shall be £38,000 cash, plus shares to a
nominal value of £35,000. Swan Bitter
has a capital of £50,000 in £1 shares, of
which 24,650 are issued.

Mt. Morgan Developments, Ltd., has
a nominal capital of £lOO,OOO in 2s.
shares, of which Mt. Morgan takes
100,000 paids, 400,000 are offered to the
parent’s shareholders, and 50,000 to the
Swan Bitter Co. The other 450,000 are
in pickle.

Paringa (W.A.) has come to light with
another and more hopeful development.
Stripping of the footwall side of the main
north drive on the 400 ft. level recently
disclosed 2ft. 6in. of ore, valued at 18dwt.
a ton. At 240 ft. north of the crosscut
the lode, sft. wide, averaged ll^dwt.

Lancefield South (W.A.), which re-
cently experienced a little trouble with
its assays, now reports that check assays
from the claim at Beria, near the Lance-
field mine, have returned from Bdwt. to
lOdwt. a ton. The co. has commenced
operations on its newly-acquired option,
the Himalaya, in the Laverton district.

The Fortuna lease in the Holleton dis-
trict, near Southern Cross (W.A.), has
been optioned by Rose Grant to the
Concord Co. The average value of the
yield has been Bdwt. a ton from a reef
4ft. wide, at a depth of 80ft.

According to cable reports, B.A.N.Z.
recently floated an Ora Banda (W.A.)
show in England. Not long ago this pro-
perty was peeped at, but not purchased,
by someone else. There has been talk
about big lodes and a profit of £lBO,OOO
being in sight. Somebody has evidently
seen something which has hitherto
escaped the notice of other mining men.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Q.E.D.: (1) Golden Horseshoe (New) is
putting through dump material at a working
cost of around 2s. per ton. (2) and (3) Can-
not say definitely, depends upon the nature
of the material and the processes involved....
S.E.C.: Quite sound. At the end of 1933
net tangibles amounted to £2,975,262, and they
can be taken as worth their book value. In-
cluding something for unexpired accident risks,
the assurance fund figured at £2,545,661.
Policy-holders can look forward to regular

“The House of Rothschild”
Had there been no Hitler there would
probably have been no such picture as
this, which was seen at a Melbourne
preview. It is frankly an appeal to the
Jews of the world ; and, though the per-
secutions which are the basis of the whole
picture are those of a century and a half
back, their inspiration is plainly the
policy of Nazi Germany.
“The Jew has only one weapon—
money,” says the hero Nathan Roths-
child, and, however much the scen-
arist has wandered from strict his-
torical fact, the fight he puts up
is an epic one, and one which wins
the sympathy of the audience. The
original Rothschild family is shown in
the ghetto of Frankfurt, oppressed and
persecuted by the Prussian overlords,
and the genesis of international credit
is depicted when the old man dying
directs his five sons to start a banking
business, each in one European capital,
and work as one unit, using credits to
avoid the danger of robbery and ex-
ploitation which then menaced the trans-
fer of coin. The rise of the family for-
tunes is followed until Nathan Roths-
child, pushed out of a big French loan
by Prussian anti-Semitic influence, gets
busy with his millions and, forcing down
the market, secures the big end of the
loan and, incidentally, leaves his enemies
in the soup. The whole works up to
the grand climax of the Battle of Water-
loo when Rothschild, supporting the
Allies in a panicked market, gets the news
of the result ahead of everybody and
cleans up a few more millions.
Woven into the picture is a love affair
betweert“Rothschild’s daughter and an
English captain, but' it has little bearing
on the plot.
George Arliss is the whole outfit.
The picture centres in his acting, first as
the old , ghetto father, then later as the
more polished Nathan, who reveals him-
self as the possessor of a wholesale
money-making mind, whereas the father
was merely a capable retailer. His ruth-
lessness to enemies, his fidelity to friends,
his humanity and his tenderness give
Arliss the opportunities for his super-
efficient acting, and it is impossible to
fault him. Helen Westley provides an ex-
cellent picture of Nathan’s mother, Boris
Karloff is gratifyingly hateful as the
Prussian diplomat, Loretta Young and
Robert Young are good-looking lovers,
and Aubrey Smith shows the Duke
Ronald Colman and Aubrey Smith in
“Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back,”
at Sydney State.
Wellington as much the sort of man he
is supposed to have been.
There is some pacifist propaganda.
When Nathan pleads that he is backing
the Allies to prevent more war his mother
observes “There would be no more war
if you cut off the pocket-money of your
kings and governments.”
“Nana”
Hollywood’s latest swan, Anna Sten,
proves to be but a goose in “Nana,” at
Sydney Regent. She’s a beauty, but
that’s all.
The story is taken from Zola’s novel,
and has been horribly distorted in the
process. Nana, a French servant girl, on
the death of her mother gravitates to
the streets, and finally attracts the atten-
tion of Greiner (Richard Bennett). The
old boy makes her a music-hall star. She
is adored by dukes and callow officers
alike. Lieut. Muffat (Phillips Holmes)
wins her heart, much to the annoyance
of his married brother, Colonel Muffat
(Lionel Atwill). The elder Muffat breaks
up the romance by getting young George
transferred to Algiers and persuading
William Powell in “The Thin Man,” at
Sydney St. James.
Greiner to dismiss his fickle mistress.
Nana faces a period of poverty and in-
cessant heartache—letters between the
lovers are intercepted—until the colonel,
who has been secretly pining for her all
the time, reappears and offers her his
heart and fortune. She accepts. All goes
tolerably well until the eve of the Franco-
Prussian War, when George makes an
unexpected return and has a terrific ver-
bal battle with his hypocritical brother.
They are on the point of running each
other through with swords when Nana,
who has listened-in to the argument from
another room, shoots herself. The dress-
ing and the scenic effects are the best
features of the film.
“The Great Defender”
Matheson Lang never disappoints, and
is never oppressed by the structural weak-
nesses of the plays in which he is cast.
“The Great Defender” depicts him as a
brilliant criminal lawyer defending the
unfaithful artist husband of the woman
he loves against a charge of having mur-
dered his model. To make the plot a
little more poignant, the main witnesses
a private detective employed by the wife
(Margaret Bannerman) to watch the hus-
band (Arthur Margetson), while Lang
himself has been warned by his doctor
that his heart will not stand the strain
of a big case. All the principals rise to
the occasion and succeed in making their
parts, if not the story, convincing. The
court scenes are well done, the crisp
exchanges between defending counsel,
prosecutor and Judge contrasting well
with the hesitating vagueness of the minor
witnesses. Margaret Bannerman’s per-
formance is polished and restrained, and
Richard Bird as a religious maniac who
kills his fiancee to save her soul makes
a good deal of a very difficult part. At
Sydney Civic.
“Splendid Fellows”
Beaumont Smith’s latest production
and not his worst. A worse film than
“The Hayseeds,” the idiotic caricature of
inland Australians whose promptitude
and firmness in crises profoundly im-
pressed competitors in the air race, would
be insupportable.
The theme is topical—an attempt to
win the air race with an Australian-built
’plane—and such Australian institutions
as the kookaburra, the koala, the sheep-
farmer (by Cecil Kellaway), the bush
girl (by Isabel McMahon), the flying
parson (by Eric Colman) and Kingsford
Smith (by himself) are worked into a
tolerable narrative. In the opening se-
quences attempts to make stage technique
serve for camera and microphone pro-
duce some bumps and jolts' in the action,
but when the story gets properly moving
such defects are less apparent. The aero-
nautical details—and these enter into the
most important parts of the production
—have been given close attention, and
the impressions of the air race given,
including actual scenes at the Australian
end, are excellent, though the long arm
of melodramatic coincidence is stretched
towards the end.
“The Thin Man”
Talkie detectives have been getting
more and more dissolute lately, and Wil-
liam Powell as the sleuth in “The Thin
Man” takes the process several notches
further. His wife (Myrna Loy) is a mil-
lionairess, and William, retired from pro-
fessional crime-solving, makes drinking
his principal business in life. His in-
numerable cocktails and highballs merely
increase his nonchalance. His wife, who
attempts occasionally to keep pace with
him, is overpowered once for a few
moments, but revives miraculously. The
climax of a series of incidents in which
acting and characterisation are so good
that their improbability is obscured is a
dinner party; to this all the persons
save one suspected of perpetrating a
series of murders are invited and com-
pelled to attend under police escort. The
one suspect not present is “the thin
man,” absent for a reason which is the
whole point of the plot. The murderer
reveals himself by attempting to shoot
his host. His- motive for the assassina-
tion that started him on.a career-of .crime
is not clear, but .you. can’t' have every-
thing. Despite its little hiatuses of plot
the story moves briskly, and there are
more chuckles and thrills than dull
moments. At Sydney St. James.
“Have a Heart”
The love story of an ice-cream man
(James Dunn) and a cripple girl (Jean
Parker), with comedy by Una Merkel
Warner Oland in “Bulldog Drummond,”
at Sydney State.
and Stuart Erwin. The story is unfolded
in a natural, straightforward way. The
girl met with an accident the day before
she was to be married, and the marriage
was off, because the prospective bride-
groom didn’t care for the idea of a lame
wife. She saved up for an operation by
a famous surgeon, but gave all the
money to get the ice-cream man released
from prison, where he was under a
charge of burglary. Instead of thanking
her, he reckoned that the restitution
clinched his guilt. Everything works out
all right in the end. Jean Parker makes
a very good impression, and acting all
round is smooth and sure. At Sydney
St. James.
"Their Big Moment"
Zasu Pitts and Slim Summerville are
assistants to "The Great La Salle" (Wil-
liam Gaxton), conjurer and faker of
spiritism, and the aid of the trio is
enlisted by relatives of a wealthy young
widow who desire to wean her from the
toils of a medical crook (Ralph Morgan).
In her first trial as a medium Zasu actu-
ally does go into a trance and receives
from the spirit world messages that upset
the apple-carts of various villains. Action
moves briskly and the humor is of the
stereotyped Pitts-Summerviile brand. At
Sydney Capitol.
"The Personality Kid"
Also at the Capitol—the history of
the rise and fall of a pugilist. Pat
O’Brien, who has had some small suc-
cesses in the ring and has attained a little
notoriety through mixing step-dancing
with his boxing, leaves business manage-
ment in the hands of his wife. This
young woman (Glenda Farrell), a hard-
boiled little New York w'isecracker, has
nYo faith in her husband’s fistic talents.
She gets him engaged by fight promoters
who see to it that he wins every fight,
because he is a good box-office asset.
When O'Brien finds out his fights have
all been schlenters he tells the world
about it. and cuts loose from his wife.
He finds it difficult to get a job. Then he
learns that he is about to become a
father and that his wife is destitute, so
he goes back into the fight game under
an agreement to lie down in the fifth
round. In the fourth he gets word that
it’s a boy, arises in his might and sends
a heavyweight championship candidate
to the canvas for ten bells. It has all
been told on the screen many times be-
fore, but O'Brien lils the pug. role so
snugly and the other characters are so
suitably cast that interest is held.
“She Loves Me Not"
Bing Crosby’s latest, and to Saturday
night’s Prince Edward audience —most of
whom evidently went to hear him croon —
somewhat disappointing. There are fewer
croons than usual, and flappers noticed
with some alarm that Mr. Crosby is not
as slim as he used to be. The story con-
cerns a night-club dancer who ran away
because she feared that, as main witness
of a gang murder, she would be clapped
in gaol till the case was heard. She
got to Princeton Uni., and persuaded
Crosby and another student to hide her
in their rooms. A film company’s repre-
sentative sleuthed her to her hiding-place.
Miriam Hopkins as the girl and Lynne
Overman as a publicity hound do best.
Kitty Carlisle forms the principal audi-
enYUYce l’or Crosby’s sad ditties.
Sundry Shows.
Percy Grainger’s recitals broadcast
from Sydney last week certainly pos-
sessed the spice of variety. From the
great classics he drew Chopin’s B Minor
Sonata and the Liszt transcription of
Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in A Minor ;
from his beloved Grieg “To the Spring”
and “Wedding Day at Troldhaugen.”
The guitar-flavored “Almeria” and “El
Puerto” of Albeniz on one programme
were balanced on another by the gong-
flavored “Pagodas” of Debussy. Works
by later composers included Balfour
Gardiner’s very rich and robust
“Michaelchurch,” Quilter’s “Moonlight
on the Lake,” some simple Scandinavian
airs by Sparre Olsen, and Grainger’s own
compositions, “Shepherds, Hey,” “Molly
on the Shore,” “One More Day” and
“Colonial Song.”
Transmissions have been fairly good,
but such nuances as the unstruck, half-
pedalled notes that conclude “Colonial
Song” were probably lost on most re-
ceivers. Grainger’s crisp, vigorous play-
ing of bravura passages, as in the Bach
fugue of Sunday night and the finale
of Friday’s Chopin sonata, was enjoy-
ably recorded, save when either end of
the keyboard was neared, when there

Look over the three New Buicks
-—The finest values in Buick History
These pictures alone give you an
impression of the long, windstream
lines and big-car proportions of
these wonderfully priced Buicks.

front seats —and you’ll find the big
car roominess you have wanted —
a roominess made snug by No-

“Tickets, One Guinea”
Things have changed in the last few
years, as borne out by your comments
and letters on the Diggers. The process
of time is eliminating the poor devil who
was a good soldier but no hand at scrap-
ping for himself.
Witness,the Vic. “Diggers’” dinner to
the Duke: tickets, one guinea ; full dress.
When the Prince of Wales was here a
similar dinner cost 45., and was attended
by many dinkum Diggers. But that was
years ago.—P. T. B. (Vic.).
Gas-heaters and Carbon Monoxide
That hardy perennial the danger of
bath-heaters is under discussion again in
Melbourne. The clamant fact is that
no gas-heater can be regarded as 100
per cent, foolproof. Energy might better
be devoted to training the public how
to safeguard the use of the heater. Car-
bon monoxide is heavier than air, and,
therefore, the individual who contents
himself with a shower is out of the
danger-zone. If it is desired to have a
plunge bath, a match lighted and low-
ered until it reaches the surface of the
water is a certain pilot. If the match
goes out, carbon monoxide is present.
If it remains lighted, the presence of
oxygen is proved. — Caretaker (Vic.).
Promotion by Merit
Old hands in the Queensland police
complain bitterly of the new regulation
enjoining promotion by merit instead of
seniority and then only after passing
examinations. Juniors have already been
hoisted over the heads of seniors and
this has fanned the discontent. Country
branches of the Police Union have passed
resolutions of protest. All this is out of
date. Promotion by merit is in force in
nearly every Empire police force nowa-
days. It early superseded the seniority
system in the A.LF., with what results
we know. — Barcoq (Q-)-
This Question of Preference
The position to which soldier-prefer-
ence has drifted is largely due to Diggers
themselves. The greatest exploiters of
returned men are to be found in their
own ranks, especially among those who
were absent from Australia for only a
brief period and who returned when
there was a full issue of sympathy. Then
there are those who decided that a poli-
tical career was a very easy life.
For the vast majority, the war is over
and finished. Despite talk to the con-
trary, the average Digger does not dis-
criminate between the “stoker” —he who
kept the home fires burning—and former
members of the A.1.F., Anyhow, the
average combatant, from my experience,
only wants preference when the other
mail could have gone to the war and
failed to do so. He does not want to
oust from competition those who were
schoolboys when the Armistice was
signed.— Sandig (N.S.W.).
Taxes and Fines
Can nothing be done towards putting
taxation on an understandable basis?
Consider these three cases, of which I
have personal knowledge:
(1) A station manager who had never
filled in an income-tax form in his life
(he is 37 years of age) was located after
the census last year. He was taxed for
five years, £7 altogether, and fined half
a crown for “late lodgment.”
(2) A man working on the same place
receiving £2 a week was landed the same
way. Taxed £l4.
(3) A third man, who had always paid
tax, posted his form for last year six
weeks ahead of the other two, but was
unlucky enough to strike wet weather,
the mails being held up for a couple of
weeks. He was taxed £1 and fined 15s.
for “late lodgment.”
Aren’t the taxpayers at least entitled
to a published statement regarding the
scale of punishment adopted? A man
stood a fighting chance against bush-
rangers, but he has absolutely none
against the Taxation Department. He is
told he has to pay so much and pay it
he must.
On a wage of £2 15s. a week a Queens-
lander pays over £5 a year in unem-
ployment-insurance and relief tax. We
outbackers get a mail sometimes. Be-
sides being fined for “late lodgment,”
we get letters dated the thirteenth of the
month demanding payment of tax within
fourteen days. Sometimes it is six weeks
before the letters arrive ; nevertheless, we
are fined another five or ten shillings for
“late payment.” It’s a wonder they
don’t tax a man for being illegally alive !
—Wonka Munna (Q.).
Ethnologists and Abos.
No; even my friend “Larrapinta” (B.
31/10/’34) can’t make me change my
opinion about modern ethnologists and
anthropologists; but I admire the record
of the gentleman mentioned. He
“fitted himself with a long course of
study,” chartered a lugger and spent la
months on Groote Eylandt with abos.
“who were quite unspoilt”—except by
contact with trepangers, prospectors,
missionaries, Dutchmen, prau men from
Macassar, Japanese pearlers and a few
others. And some of the noble fellows
were so cosmopolitan that they “hid no-
thing from him.” Therein they ran true
to form: the local garb is two dogs’
teeth and a parrot feather or two.
The language difficulty doesn’t worry
“Larrapinta’s” idol, for .he is “a born
linguist.” Persian is the easiest language
in the world. It takes picked Foreign
Office men a couple of years to get a
second-class interpreter’s certificate in it,
T
and even then they are far from quali-
fied to discuss highly complex family
relationships. I should estimate that it
would take even a “born linguist” four
years (there are no written vocabularies
worth a dump) to get a working
knowledge of any North Australian
dialect, especially seeing that he could
not understand all that was going on
around him without knowing the sign
language, as well as the spoken. It would
take him another 10 years to find out
when his leg was being pulled. A lot
of the Australian ethnology brought back
by “born linguists” is on a par with the
tales which Diggers used to tell in Lon-
don about their goanna farms. Binghi
is a merry fellow.
I fancy, however, that the experts
whom “Larrapinta” names would be
more modest about themselves than
he is in praising them. — Yeni-Punyamai
(N.S.W.).
Tired
I am very tired. Not with the type of
languor which a few early nights would
remove, but with that variety which
comes over the average elector When he
casts an eye over politics as a whole.
I see a party once great and sincere
now divided and devoid of all dignity—
the prey of officials and organisers who
cannot speak the King’s English cor-
rectly, and who jockey their inadequate
nominees into the legislature. I see a
minor group whose numbers have lately
been augmented by the election of an
ex-Communist who led the. timber strike
from behind.
I see the national Parliament rocking
with moronic laughter while a mounte-
bank debases and delays proceedings on
opening day, while unemployment and
unrest hang like a pall over the country.
I see an embittered party leader hold-
ing the balance of power as a bludgeon
to force acceptance of his views upon an
inept little man whose only claim to
fame as a statesman is his candor in
stating that he wished to hold up the
business of the country in order that he
might see the Cup run.
I see a State Premier who in 52
speeches has referred 51 times to the
mess the place was in when he took over.
Undoubtedly he voices a truth, but re-
iteration is wearisome, and as an excuse
for inertia it is becoming threadbare.
I see the same politician complacently
arrogating to himself the credit for an
improvement due wholly and solely to
the rise in last season’s wool prices, and
I wonder whether he will accept respon-
sibility as readily for the setback which
must come if this year’s prices do not
improve.
1 see good legislation cast out because
of. slavish adherence to the party sys-
tem ; shameless patronage extended to
friends and supporters; public money
expended prodigally on fruitless commis-
sions and on increases for highly-paid
officers- of a railway service which is
considered to have done well if it loses
only quarter of a million a.month.
I see a daily press, biased beyond re-
demption, trying to pull the legs of a
people who have become so disgusted
that not all the specious vaporings of
either side could bring them out of doors
to listen to the unimaginative mediocri-
ties offering themselves for election last
September.
As I said before, I am very tired. —
Plebs Fatigatus (N.S.W.).


ABORIGINALITIES
“Scribe”: When a Great Personage
was here long ago I was one of the re-
porters who had to accompany him on
the official, say, wombat hunt organised
for self and party. With another press-
man I went, the night before, to the coun-
try town whence the hunt was to start,
and we both lost no time getting into
contact with the famous wombat guide
whom officialdom had allotted to accom-
pany the Personage into the field of
operations. We filled up the guide with
whisky and fixed him to give us full
details of the slaughter when it ceased
the following eve. In the midst of our
diplomacy, the guide would give tongue
to his hopes of the morrow. “I won-
der what his Nibs’ll spring?” he mused.
“A fiver’s the regular fee for a wombat
guide in an English gentleman’s country
home.” He would have another of our
whiskies and resume the reverie. “But I
expect this chap’ll come a tenner.” An-
other drink and he would register hopes
still rising: “I wouldn’t be a bit sur-
prised if he came twenty.” As we con-
tinued the good work with the whisky-
bottle the market hardened, and before
we parted for bed the prospective tip
had grown to a terrace of houses. Next
day the hunting came off, and we met
the guide looking very sad. He held out
his hand, on which something reposed.
He murmured huskily: “ A blanky pipe.”

“Gypsos”: Wrayland Wray, of Bris-
bane, attempting to break his own record
of 33 days from Brisbane to Adelaide,
arrived in Mildura recently after padding
it across 250 miles of plain. Total length
of the stroll is 1459 miles, and Wray’s
daily average for the trip has been 45
miles, with a longest hop of 71 miles.
He has had to have his legs attended to
by bush nurses and ambulance men, but
that is a mere detail. Wray is a Digger,
and was at the Landing.
* * * *
“Puffinus”: For a fortnight, as I write,
the South Queensland beaches for over
200 miles have been dotted with the
draggled bodies of drowned petrels.
Here and there one comes across a swim-
ming laggard, too exhausted to rise, and
lonely in its separation from the migrat-
ing flock. They are visitors from far-
distant northern seas, bound south for
the nesting season on southern Vic-
torian coasts and the islands of Bass
Strait. Unreasonable weather—heavy
blows from south and south-east, in
place of the usual northerly winds —has
overtaxed their strength. Petrels are prob-
ably the most numerous of all birds in
the world—Flinders estimated one flock
which he saw in Bass Strait at 132,000,000
birds. That curious colony of white
and parti-colored Australians who live on
Cape Barren Island gain their entire liv-
ing from the eggs and young of mutton-
birds, a species of petrel. In 1909 the
take was valued at £4OOO.

“Wilga Willie”: Out on Bogan
(N.S.W.) banks the other day I was filling
in wet-weather time by collecting fire-
wood. A paddock of ringbarked box
looked promising, but inspection showed
the trees to be riddled with termites. One
scarred-looking old veteran, however, had
a lot of fallen logs at its foot which the
industrious white-ants had left quite
alone. Puzzled, 1 asked the boss about it.
"Oh, that tree was struck by lightning ;
white-ants never touch ’em afterwards.”
Fact or fable?

“Notaden”: Those cross-bearing frogs
(B. 17/10/’34) after heavy rains appear in
great numbers in many places west of the
Dividing Range, coming out in daylight
in massed formation, a risk which no
other Australian frog or toad ever takes.
They are plucky little chaps, and if poked
up with a grass stem will blow themselves
out, stand up on their hind legs and face
the enemy boldly. This bluff takes in such
unsophisticated natural enemies as snakes
and large birds, but it does not deceive

sa y s small brown-snakes are harmless ;
hut are they? Last summer a rooster
ran by me with a 9in. black-headed
brown wriggler. As we looked the snake
swung round and bit the fowl near the
eye . The roo ster flicked the snake off,
picked it up again and ran on. Half an
hour i ater we found the bird dead,

“Jim R.”: Recently captured on Ruth-
ven (C.Q.), an outsize in spiders—over
6in. across. One of the trap-door clique,
this chap is known to museum men as
Selenocosmia crassipes, and to the folk
outback as the barking spider, owing to
his ability to utter an audible staccato
whistle when hot under the collar. This
is the second of the species. to be cap-
tured on the Barcoo ; the first, which
had a young chicken tightly embraced,
was dispatched and forwarded to the
Queensland Museum by Arthur Sexton,
of Gaza, Isisford. The kin of this beastie
was met by Baldwin Spencer further
north, where it also digs a cellar, but,
unlike its relatives, attaches no lid.

“Veega”: “Encue's” cobber with his
alligator-pigs (B. 10/10/’34) wasn't any
more shocked than I was in 1924.
Boundary-riding on a station west of the
Darling (N.S.W.) I left camp one night
carrying a hurricane-lamp to inspect
traps set amongst box-timber around the
edge of a dry lake. Near the beginning
of my trap line I tripped over a fallen
branch ; the lamp went out, a mob of
topknot pigeons went away with their
characteristic whirr, an exceptionally
bright-blue meteor flashed across the
sky, and the earth “blew up” in front of
me with a rumble. All this happened
simultaneously! Any bushman-soldier
will excuse me for ducking, though
my last shell-burst was way back in ’lB.
Recovering, I gingerly investigated the
“eruption.” It was a stray camel.

“8/2800”: Those plates put into the
old Torch at Cockatoo (B. 17/10/’34)
have by now been turned into something
more modern by the Japs. Ten or 12
years ago the old tub was acquired by
a M.L. syndicate and converted for the
Chatham Island fishing trade. It was
rumored on the Wellington waterfront
that the cost of acquisition and conver-
sion was met from the sale of non-
ferrous metals recovered during the
alterations. But after a trip or two as
the Rama —Maori for Torch—she was
found unsuitable for the job, and was
last seen in the hands of Wellington ship-
wreckers.

“1.M.C.”: Jacky had been given a
discarded sports shirt with a zip-fastener.
A few days later the overseer called at
Jacky’s gunyah and found Mary scrub-
cutting, work which was rightly Jacky’s.
“Where’s Jacky, Mary?” he inquired.
“Him bin inside, boss. That pfeller loafer
now. Him do no work since boss gibbit
him that rip-tear-buzzer shirt.”

“Silentio”: The N.S.W. station I was
lately on paid a tenner a head for a mob
of very indifferent hacks. They were
hard to get, some being brought over 300
miles. On the same holding eight years
ago we had a paddock of fillies on an
outstation, where they had to stay for
18 months owing to lack of food and
water at the homestead. When we
mustered them there were 27 fine foals,
due to the attentions of a runaway
thoroughbred from an adjoining holding.
Though the sire was an imported stallion
of merit, our manager had the whole
issue of youngsters shot. Shows how
the outlook changes for horses.

“Formix”: That yarn about the snake-
lings with legs (B. 24/10/’34) reminds
me of a similar perplexing problem
which long ago confronted two raw Irish
immigrants in Queensland. Just off the
8.1. boat, they were given swags and
rations and told to take the western road,,
where jobs were plentiful. They asked
many questions about the Australian
fauna, and some of the old hands took
pains to instruct them. A couple?£
days out they were boiling the billy
when a fearful scream from Aloysius
drew his mate’s attention. Fixedly re-
garding a huge bull-ant he held between
his fingers, he asked: “Jerome, do
shnakes have legs?” “Th’ divil a wan,
replied his imperturbable cobber. “On,
thin, be jabbers, Oi’ve been bit be a wal-
laby.”

“Cudgerie”: Spinifex and how it burns
(B. 17/10/’34). A man “slewed” in the
McKinlay Range country of n.-w. Queens-
land was given his bearings with a fire lit
on the top of the highest ridge. The
trunk of a large hollow tree was packed
with spinifex and set alight. The huge
pillar of flame was visible 20 miles away,
and with the changing wind flashed some-
thing like a revolving lighthouse beacon.
* * * *
“Dionan”: “Stampede sense” seems to
run in porpoises, too (B. 19/9/’34). Was
off the Mewstone (Tas.) when we met a
school tallying nearer a thousand than
nine hundred. The nearest porps. were
rolling and blowing right alongside when
I leant out and jabbed one with a boat-
hook. He said “Grrmph!” and went.
So did t’others. in 30 seconds the tally of
porps. was about minus one. All gone!
Why and how?

“C.H.F.”: There’s not much wrong
with our cocker-spaniel when it comes
to brains. He’s found out angry bees
will go straight for his most vulnerable
point—his nose. He still sniffs about
the hives, but upon first sign of trouble
makes a bolt for a grass tussock and
buries his muzzle deep in it, keeping his
tail-end wagging merrily in the air, as if
to let us know all’s well.

“Tropical”: Pegging a trial, survey for
a railway job outside of Gladstone (Q.)
I was dragging a five-chain steel tape
through some spear-grass when a big
hawk swooped from the blue, grabbed
the tape near the other end and flew
with it to the top of a tall gum. As
he perched there half-dazed at the dimen-
sions of his catch I gave the thing a pull ;
that hawk departed quicker than a public
servant at 5 p.m. Another time, in the
woolly west, the tape I was dragging
through tall Mitchell grass was re-
peatedly jerked. As I was far away
from a pub and hadn’t yet adopted
corks round my hat I hung around while
an axeman pulled the tape. An outsize
in cats came into view, making repeated
springs to capture the elusive reptile.

“Mooloo”: Picton (N.S.W.) claims to
have the oldest licensed premises in Aus-
tralia in the Royal George. At one time
it was a half-way house between Sydney
and Berrima, and here were temporarily
lodged—in the great stone cellar —all
prisoners en route to Berrima gaol. The
Royal George dates back to 1819, and
its thick stone walls and solid cedar doors
bear out its claim to antiquity.
* * * *
“G.E.E.” (Papua): Anyone who has
ever smelt matoa, a species of wild
arrowroot, will agree that the gidya-tree
(B. 1 /8/’34) is mild. In Papua matoa
abounds, especially around the planta-
tion near our homestead in the Eastern
Division. A bell-shaped parchment -bud,
maroon in color, appears above the sur-
face first, and as it grows is filled with
gas ; the bud bursts and exudes its odor
for a 300-yard radius. The smell sug-
gests one thing only—the whole of a
city sewage system bursting through the
ground. Notwithstanding this, in times
of food shortage natives dig up the
bulb below the surface, roast it on open
fires, allow it to cool, roast it again next
day, then eat it.
* * * *
“Ronel”: I hereby raise the bid of
“Torquata” (B. 24/10/’34) in the big-
kurrajong deal. About 30 miles east of
Moree (N.S.W.) lie Barbour’s Lagoons.
The longest and deepest waterhole is
shaded by a kurrajong with a history.
Here in 1864 “Old Barbour,” a shepherd
on Bogamildi station, found refuge for six
days from swirling floodwaters which
covered the ground at this point as far
as the eye could see, and swept the flock
of jumbucks under his care to a watery
grave. In the 1902 drought this tree,
along with a few small ones, kept the
station killers in prime condition when
many lambs had grown to maturity with-
out knowing the smell of grass. When
the station Jopper finished his job he
tied his old felt hat to the topmost limb,
bare and branchless, 75ft. from the
ground. In 1919, another local drought
year, I lopped the big tree myself. It has
an overgrown scar encircling its girth
at axe-swing level where some fool evi-
dently ringbarked the old warrior about
50 years ago ; but it takes an extra deep
and wide scarf to kill a kurrajong. This
one’s girth 3ft. from the ground is 13ft.
6in., apd l ift, at' a height of 20ft.
“WELL, ANYWAY”—
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Dad winds up the argument,
Debate, dispute or family row,
We know his ammunition’s spent
So far as reason will allow.
We’ve had our say and he’s had his;
We think we’ve won, as well we may;
I hat’s when he says with emphasis:
“Well, anyway”
“Well, anyway, you boys don’t know—
You’re wandering somewhere off the track;
Well, anyway, you're wrong, although
You argue like a lawyer pack.”
And we fire back: “Yes, yes! But—but”
While warm and warmer grows the fray
Of counterthrust in that blind rut:
“Well, anyway”
But dear old Mum, quick to arrest
The growing acrimonious touch,
Cuts in: “Now, boys, just give that best;
You’ve had your say, a bit too much.
Father will think it over, too;
It’s lime you went to cut the hay.”
And Dad just gives his beard a screw:
“Well, anyway”
Sometimes (if to a point he’s pinned)
The phrase fills in a mental blank
To gain his thinking “second wind,”
Or reasons new (to be quite frank).
More often it’s a dodge that works
To hold compefitors at bay,
While faster comes his talk in jerks:
“Well, anyway”——
Good on old Dad! He’s one of
those
Who see instinctively, or do,
Whatever way the talk-wind
blows,^
The horse-sense act or point of
view.
And when it comes to others’
faults
Tt’s not a case of preach or
pray,
But two kind words where censure
halts:
“Well, anyway”
The saint who drafts the good
* from bad
Will have his joke on Judgment
Day.
He’ll wink one eye: “What, you
here, Dad?
Well, anyway!’’

“Bert the Carpenter”: I was putting
a roof on a cottage at Enfield (S.A.) a
few years ago, and in an adjoining pad-
dock saw two magpies start a fight over
a lady. It ended in a draw. One decided
she wasn’t worth all the trouble and took
wing. The other followed, and when his
opponent perched on an electric-light
wire he sat on the opposite one, carolled
defiance, and landed a bullying peck at
the other. Both fowls went to glory in
a stink of burning feathers.
* * * *
“Sydney Absentee”: Last winter in a
boxthorn hedge along the Melbourne-
Bendigo road, I noticed from the car
many dark objects caught in the bare,
prickly branches. They were decaying
carcasses of birds; verdict, death by
misadventure. The owner of an orchard
in Gippsland often finds birds and mice
stuck on the sharp-pointed twigs of pear-
trees. These casualties are attributed to
the slaughtering butcher-birds, which are
over-plentiful in the district.
# * * *
“Kieta”: Workers on salt Lake Tyr-
rell, near Sea Lake (Vic.), have to con-
tend with many discomforts whilst on
the job. The glare from miles of white
salt is trying, and skin peels off. But the
worst drawback is that they can’t keep
fresh water on the job, as, no matter
where a waterbag is put, it is only a
matter of a few minutes before the water
in the bag. turns salt.
*.* * *
“Der Jong”: I doubt that story about
a Zulu indaba and dance in which
both sexes danced in the rude (B.
24/10/’34). In the first' place, no
Zulu woman would be allowed for a
moment to take part with the men in a
dance. Like our own abo. women, they
squat at a distance and supply the music.
The dancing dress of the Zulu warrior
is one of the most gorgeous and impres-
“But if a fellow used that they’d think he was a sissy!”
sive in the savage world. Game-skin
karosses, monkey-fur headgear, heavy
kilts of wildebeest tails and appendages
of long white cattle hair from arms and
knees, with the fighting bull-hide shield,
half a dozen assegais and two or three
parrying sticks, plus a ’kerrie or two,
comprise the equipment. Whatever the
stress, there is one garment the male
Zulu never discards in public under any
circumstances. All South Africans know
it, and it is sold freely in Cape Town
and Durban to tourists off the Union
Castle liners as a salt-cellar or a pin-
holder for a lady’s dressing table.

Tropical : There s a pelican that
cruises in Ross Creek, running alongside
the railway station at Townsville. I
watched him paddling leisurely along the
edge of the creek until he came to two
fishermen sitting in a flattie and sorting
their haul. He of the enormous bill,
with a stroke of his port propeller, came
genlly alongside and expectantly stood
by. The fishermen began to toss the
tiddlers at him, which he adroitly caught.
He only took straight deliveries, com-
pletely ignoring any bodyline stuff, even
after it hit the water. When I left his
Plimsoll mark was hidden, and as he
was still catching feebly I wondered if
he made port safely.

“Nikko”: I can assure “Sa Tiko” (B.
3/10/’34) that some cats are not in any
way fussy about how their mice are
killed and delivered. One icy morning
I found a mouse drowned in the pigeons’
bath, and somewhat diffidently offered it
to the nearest cat. He fell upon it, tossed
it, growled menacingly at curious fellow-
felines, and finally crunched the chill
morsel. This particular cat is an enter-
prising and successful mouser.
* :> * *
“Inaha”: Two Whangaroa (M.L.) men
claim to have discovered a cavern con-
taining human remains which may take
their place amongst the world’s missing
links. Many skeletons, male and female,
are excellently preserved ; some of the
latter show traces of reddish hair, which
suggests that the remains are not those of
Maoris. Cooking and sleeping places
are practically intact, and everywhere in
the cavern are signs of feasting, while
bones of fish, birds and humans are
mingled with what are perhaps moa
bones. Wooden fish-hooks with shell-
tipped barbs were also found.
* * * *
“Elaps”: “Diba More” (B. 24/10/’34)
will collect the bet from his Papuan cob-
ber who said that eggs containing legged
reptiles were not lizards, as “D.M.”
averred, but snakes, their legs dropping
off after hatching. They were lizards, of
course, since no snake since the Eden
curse has possessed shanks. Some of the
beasts, especially the pythons, display
rudimentary “claspers” at two-thirds of
their length. The purpose for which these
are used has nothing to do with locomo-
tion.
* . * * *
“Durah”: There’s no doubt about the
bullock being a better swimmer than the
horse (B. 24/10/’34). The classical in-
stance occurred on the Burnett River
(Q.) in the early ’sixties. Jim Currant,
a famous bullocky of those days, was
trying to get his team with a big load of
wool across the Upper Burnett just as a
big flood was swooping down. The team
got caught on the wave and was swept
downstream. Jim had intended to make
Toowoomba, but now there was no help
for it. Mounting the load, the top tiers
of which floated above water, he en-
couraged his bullocks, now swimming
vigorously with the flood. I forget
whether it took him 24 or 48 hours to
come sailing into Bundaberg. The banks
were well submerged, and Jim guided his
intelligent team so successfully that it
made a splendid landing on the under-
water wharf of the old Q.S.N. Co.
* * * *
“C.F.A.”: “L.H.S.’s” • frilly lizard (B
17/10/’34) must have been a water
n zar d. Though he might pass as Frill’s
double, he is a wirier, smaller chap and
dis P° rts himself most ably in the water,
with frequent sun baths. Sometimes half
a do zen gambol in the water together—
they dog-paddle with their heads well up
and make pretty fair pace. Also their
holes are generally on the creek bank,
frequently with the water lapping the
front door, though the inside is dry
enough.
“8.J.”: A trio
of youngsters on
a Barcoo (Q.)
sheep station have
taught fish in the
dams and tanks
to feed from their
hands. The fish
are spangled
grunters, and evi-
dently don’t re-
sent handling, as
on being returned
to the water they
make no attempt
to get away. But
“Come down out of that, you brat, or I’ll come up an’
fetch yer !”
cast a shadow on the surface and
they are gone like a shot. Doubtless
it brings memories of the arrival of their
arch-enemy the heron and the sudden
disappearance of a few. relatives.
* * * *
“El V.”: “De Bee” (B. 24/10/’34)
wants to know if there is anything an
artist draws as badly as an axe. Yes —•
most flora and fauna, ex-
cept humans and beer-
bottles. Horses and cattle
are particular victims. One
of our most famous race-
horses, as painted by one
of our best animal artists,
prances on one leg, which
is as unnatural as a fisher-
man passing a pub. And
I saw Strawberry repre-
sented the other day, in
the guise of a prize-
winner, with a ewe neck,
horses’ hooves on her
front feet, her hocks in
the wrong place, her
shoulder out of joint. She
had no milk vein and a
sway back, and was as
thick on the chine as a
Shorthorn bull, while no-
thing over a five-year-old
child could have milked
her diminutive teats. The
genius had been gazing at
her for hours before he
drew her, though I have
seen him glimpse at a
human and turn him on to
paper true to life in a few
seconds. The only branch
of homo sapiens who is usually libelled
is Binghi, who normally is awarded big
feet, whereas the neatness of his appen-
dages puts duchesses to shame.
“M. at A.”: “Aye” to “De Bee” —
guns, rifles, pistols, revolvers and swords.
This is the more remarkable since many
of the fellows served with the A.1.F.,
which ought to put them right. There are
some notable exceptions, but what I say
is true of the mob. Their rifles are a
scream to the expert, and the revolvers
a stomach-ache. Perhaps swords are the
chief stumbling-blocks. Even in The
Bulletin pictures appear showing the
back of the hilt facing the inward curve
—all swords drawn by these people are
sabres, though both cavalry and infantry
now carry a straight poker under regu-
lations, save generals and officers of the
10th Hussars, who in fullest fig carry
the curved “scimitar” with the cross-
handle.
“H.A.L.”: How
fast can a bush-
fire travel (B.
3/10/’34)? Dur-
ing the big Eden
Valley (S.A.) fire
a car, driven flat
out, was unable
to race the flames
to the township
of Mt. Pleasant.
The big burn in
the Mallee which
swept the Wyn-
arka (S.A.) dis-
trict just before
the war travelled
at an amazing
speed ; it seemed
to have a whirl-
wind in the van
which sent burn-
ing fragments far
ahead, so that
the flames ap-
peared to leap
across the coun-
try in a series of
waves. For a
time a bushfire
travels at a pace a good deal slower than
the driving wind, but once a wide face
is made the fire seems to create a tor-
nado-like swirl ahead of it.

“Inglegar”: Poor old Bunny—is he to
have no privacy at all? “Gam” (B.
26/9/’34) tells of starlings nesting in his
home; I knew of a bees’ nest with a
normal amount of honey and comb being
uncovered in a burrow on a Mores
(N.S.W.) station. The former tenant had
readily vacated in favor of the buzzers.
* # * *
“Colin Catchpenny”: What are ibises
doing in the grasshopper invasion? Once
I could rely on seeing these ancient nosey
old birds turning up almost to a date
when the few grasshoppers were about.
This year I’ve seen nary a one. Are
the ibises trying conscientiously (they look
as though they would) to clean up any
one patch, or have they died from ner-
vous frustration at the thought of their
colossal task?
* * * *
“Airline”: Fishing a couple of miles
away from the homestead I was sur-
prised to hear the loud cackling of a
fowl. As I turned to investigate, a fox
ran past with the unfortunate bird, still
cackling frenziedly, slung across its neck.
Came to the conclusion that it was a
vixen bent upon giving her brood a
demonstration of the kill.
* * * *
“G.G.6”: The fuss over the alleged
dangers of the Alsatian dog reminds me
we have had these alarums and excursions
before. Many years ago my father, then
g.m. of the Australian Pastoral Co., which
had many dingo-infested stations in s.-w.
Queensland, imported a couple of leashes
of Scottish deerhounds —used in their
native land to run down the red-deer by
speed and scent combined —to kill off
the wild dogs which kept an expensive
retinue of trappers busy. One or two
others joined him in the venture. All
were staggered by the outburst of bellow-
ing from uninstructed asses all over
Queensland to the effect that the giant
Scottish dog would eventually mate with
the dingo and set up a breed as danger-
ous to man as to sheep or cattle. The
Scotsmen killed the dingoes all right—
I would back any one of them to settle
any Alsatian in one grip across the back-
bone, their pet hold —but, since they hac!
to be accompanied by people they knew
and well looked after and fed, proved
costlier than the “doggers.” Some we
used for kangaroo-hunting, and others
were distributed among friends. Ne’er
a one of these very fine gentlemen ever
showed signs of stooping to the lure of
a lady dingo, though all had pjenty of
liberty.
STRICTLY PERSONAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m sick of working the long years through,
with little to show for it;
It’s time, I reckon, I took a pull and worked
the old nut a bit.
There’s lots more mugs about to-day than
there’s been for many a year, > .
So I am hanging my shingle out as a mining
engineer.
I’ve qualified in the proper way—there are no
restraining Acts —
You don’t need much but a good thick hide
and a disregard for facts.
I guarantee to supply reports on any and ev’ry
show
That will almost make the vendor think he
has set his price too low.
If you’ve a mine that you want to sell and the
buyers fail to bite.
Just come to*me and I’ll guarantee that things
will soon be right.
But, before we get to business, I’ll give you one
little tip:
There’s nothing doin’ if you suggest that I
take my fee in scrip.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND'S
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
WET WOOL.
“Murrawong”: “Dead Finish” spon-
sors some dangerous misinformation by
minimising the risk of pressing wet wool
(B. 24/10/”34). The risk of spontaneous
combustion may be slight; it is not the
wool but the vegetable matter contained
in it that may be ignited by damp and
pressure.
Tt is particularly unwise to take risks
with fleece or skirtings carrying heavy
grass-seed. Any wool-scourer will tell
you that he takes more care with the
drying of seedy wool than with any
other type.
Practically any wool pressed wet will
heat to a certain extent, and, while there
is little need to worry about it going up
in smoke, the chances are that it will
open up like a brick —especially if it
carries a lot of condition —and it will
be so musty and mould-stained that it
will have to be reconditioned for sale.
That means an extra charge because of
its unattractive appearance. Hundreds
of wet bales have to be reconditioned
in every big selling centre every year.
The bale is emptied and the wool spread
out to dry and air for a couple of days
before it is pressed again. Floor-space
in city woolstores is both limited and
costly.
My experience of old-time versus the
present-day shearers on wet sheep differs
considerably from that of “Dead Finish.”
Once two or three points of rain meant
a hang-up for from two to four days.
In Queensland, especially, the number of
days sheep took to dry was at times fan-
tastic, and depended more on the two-up
school than on the weather.
I remember one case in N.Q. in which
the team voted the sheep wet and sat
down for five days, although not a drop
of rain had fallen for six months.
The present-day shearer has got over
most of the bad habits of the old, wild
days. An old-time rouseabout summed
up the position pretty closely recently:
“Shearers nowadays are no good to us
blokes. Half of ’em will shear with the
frogs hopping out of the belly wool, and
the other half”—he expectorated savagely
—“they’d shear cod straight out of the
Darling! ”
OPHTHALMIA OR “PINK-EYE.”'
“Sorghum”: Recent investigations
have proved the disease to be due to
germ infection of the outer part of the
eyeball, and is characterised by watering
and a tendency to keep the eyes closed.
Later, ulcers appear and the animal
becomes blind. The old method adopted
was to blow powdered alum into the
eyes. This is both cruel and futile.
The first essential is that the eyes are
freed of chaff and grass seeds. That
done, several effective treatments are
available.
I successfully treated some sheep last
season with one part' zinc sulphate and
40 parts distilled water.
The sheep should be isolated in a dark-
ened shed, and the eyes bathed with a
boracic solution. Afterwards use two
or three drops of the lotion, taking care
that it flows freely under the lids so as
to reach all parts. A couple of applica-
tions should check the disease in its early
stages.
Where the disease is advanced, treat-
ment twice a day may be needed before
a complete cure is obtained. The lotion
can be ap P lied with either a soft brush
or an ordinary eye-dropper.

Since most era/iers in this area are
Mnee most graziers in tms area are
aso wheatgrowers, they have facilities
for fodder conservation, which, in my
opinion, is essential to carry sale stock
over low-price periods.
DIP, JET, CRUTCH AND TRAP.
“Albarmount”: Writers on this sub-
ject don’t sufficiently stress the influence
of climatic conditions. In favorable sea-
sons the flies breed in such numbers
and are so persistent that all methods go
by the board. Crutch and/or jet and
they will strike between the shoulders or
on the belly on wrinkly merino or plain
crossbreds alike.
Naturally they have to deposit their
maggots somewhere.
Last year my sheep were only immune
for a fortnight after dipping, though we
stir our dip well and dip slowly in small
mobs of 500 to 600 at a time.
In the absence of a suitable repellent
to keep them off the sheep it is theoreti-
cally feasible that traps, which would
catch the greater proportion of the flies,
should be the best means of control.
But the traps have never been thor-
oughly tested. To do this, it would be
necessary to enforce their use for 12
months over an area of at least 100
miles square. Even then, only a few
properties in the centre of the area could
hope to be free of trouble.
I think a half-carcass placed in a half
44gal. drum, allowed to get maggoty and
then filled half-way up the carcass with
arsenic water, is the best trap for pri-
mary flies.
The failure of traps is analogous to
my experience with the crows. For six
years I have poisoned them with phos-
phorus and fat. This year my loss of
ewes through crow-picked eyes was the
greatest I’ve had —7 per cent. 1 smile
when my neighbors say their paddocks
are littered with dead crows (1 see very
few dead ones on my property) ; but I
scowl when they say they “didn’t have a
bit of trouble with the crows.” Yet they
do nothing. Locally it is believed that
the dead ones on their properties act
as scares, while the “feed” 1 give them
decoys them as baited traps do the
blowflies!
. ■ ■ •
THOSE WOOL TYPES.
“Sheepo”: “Murrawong” forgets one
salient point (B. 17/10/’34). We’ve got
to move with the times.
My rating, to which he objects, would
not have got hearing a couple of decades
ago —80’s were as common then as are
60's to-day. The change-over from the
short-stapled and fine-fibred Vermont to
plain-bodied and more robust types has
made a revolution.
Graziers very sensibly bred for weight
per head and the production of a broader
staple. They had to do it. Manufacturers
wouldn’t pay the price that extra spin-
ning capacity should have merited.
Hawkesworth, in “Australasian Sheep
and Wool,” places 64-70’s as a “strong”
type in Victoria and Tasmania. These
types might have been regarded as such
at the time he wrote. Big changes have
taken place since, not in type but in
actual production. Throughout the Com-
monwealth the bulk of the merino out-
put ranges from 60-64’s, yet an inspection
of both sheep and wool at country shows
gives evidence of how chaotic the posi-
tion is.
Brown in one district exhibits a fleece
in the fine-wool class which isn’t better
than a 60’s. Jones from some other
district has a fleece in the same class
that would bulk as 70’s. You couldn’t
tell Brown his wool was in the wrong
class; his wool is the finest quality in
his district.
Superfine types are fading very rap-
idly, simply because buyers are not in a
position to pay extra for wool, all other
things being equal, that will spin a couple
of counts more than the average.
Prices for 64’s and 70’s tops prove
this.
I’m not concerned whether 64’s are
called fine, medium or strong, but I want
to see a definite line of demarcation in
country-show fleece sections.
MORE ARITHMETIC.
“Gippsland”: Counting sheep is it?
Try this. Count every fourth sheep—or
every four if you like—as one, but don’t
stop at 25. When finished, multiply by
four.
Down here (Gippsland) we seldom
count more than 2000 in a mob and by
this method we practically do away
with the use of tallies.
If one is not too confident threes might
be used, but, after a bit of practice, any-
one should soon be able to tackle fours.
The best place to count? I find a
race about sft. to Bft. wide “on its
own.”
The sheep seem to move through more
evenly and there is no chance of that
horror “the cow that breaks behind.”
LAMBS’ WOOL
“R. E. Combing”: “Lion’s” direction
for sorting lambs’ wool (B. 24/10/’34)
should be taken to heart by wool-
growers with this added note: Lambs’ -
wool sells as well in the “stars” as in
the big lots.
Furthermore, once pressed up in a
mixed condition, lambs’ wool is difficult
to sort, and the job is not usually the
best when done. In the store of a Sydney
repacker it took my mate and self the
best part of the day to sort 4001 b., which
is about half of the required tally. The
repacker would have to get his wool
cheaply to make a profit at that rate.
Two points “Lion” might have added :
(1) The need to observe quality in grad-
ing crossbred lambs’ wool. Of course,
length roughly determines quality, the
longer wool usually being the coarser.
(2) The need to take hairy tips out oi
merino lambs’ wool. It is commonly
found in the progeny of strong-woolled
rams, but may appear anywhere, and the
healthy lamb is more likely to produce
it than a sickly animal.
DEALING WITH NOOGOORA.
“W.W.”: For years, like ‘ f Nedos” (B.
24/10/’34), 1 fought the pest, pulling as
soon as plants appeared. Waste of
time. Though we persevered, the coun-
tryside along watercourses became nearly
useless.
Then the shire proclaimed the plant a
noxious weed. Compulsory clearing fol-
lowed.
After that, we allowed the plant to
mature until March. All plants flower.
With short, strong-bladed scythes we
cut it close to ground. With that treat-
ment the burr will not shoot again.
One man with a scythe is as good
as 20 men pulling. Start at the source
so that floods may not supply a fresh
annual crop.
We once burnt land along the creek
frontage to assure an early crop of spring
grass. Instead of grass we got Noogoora.
Our cattle ate it, and in two days we lost
72 of our best bullocks poisoned. In
the young stage Noogoora is poisonous.
PICKING THE PROFITABLE COW.
“Bahb Dwyer”: “Stump Jump” (B.
24/10/’34) talks of picking them by the
old methods of bright eye, broad muzzle,
soft texture of skin and udder and the
rest. I’m prepared to admit that as a
rule a good producer will measure up
well in these respects, but there are so
many darned exceptions that the prac-
tical ccw-farmer wants something more
accurate. “Stump Jump’s” remark that
“line-breeding alone can ensure success,
and that is beyond most cow-cockies”
gives me a pain.
The cow-farmer to-day is shrewd and
competent, and scientific breeding and
feeding are not beyond him. They used
to say something very similar a few
years ago to the poultry-farmers: “You
fellows must not try to improve your
flocks by breeding from your best pro-
ducers. You must place type before
everything, and for type you must come
back to us”—“us” being the fanciers.
The utility poultry-farmers eventually
started their own associations and laid
down their own standards. The result?
Australia is now third on the list of
countries supplying eggs to Great Britain.
We pioneered egg-laying competitions
and hold all the worth-while world’s
records.
All the talk of type can’t alter the
fact that the one infallible way of gaug-
ing an animal’s productive ability is by
keeping a record of its performance, and
that goes for families as well as indi-
viduals. The man who has consistently
Babcock-tested knows too well that good
looks don’t necessarily indicate profitable
cows, so why should he breed for im-
provement except from his best pro-
ducers?
I plump for the proven production as
a test, believing that when breeding is
along the right lines type will look after
itself.

National Service
T'HE history of the National Bank of Australasia dates
* back to 1858, when the gold-digging boom was at
its height. The Bank took its share in the activities of
those stirring times, and, as the rich mines became worked
out, and the population directed its energies to grazing,
farming and manufacturing industries, it provided neces-
sary financial facilities and assisted in the expansion of
production and trade.
During the years of land settlement, railroad
extension and increasing population, the National Bank
maintained close contact with all sections of industry,
added widely to its establishment and improved the
facilities it afforded. Thus it linked itself to the progres-
sive forces in the community and took its part in the
development of the Australian nation.
Its present establishment consists of 427 offices and
branches spread through the cities and country districts
of Australia, as well as two branches in London. In
addition, it is represented by well-known banking houses
in important trading centres the world over.

Dear Sirs, We are pleased to testify to the
excellent satisfaction given by the Bft. Sunshine Header
we purchased from you this season. It handled an
l 1 -bag crop of Cape Barley with ease, and made a
splendid sample. Working in a heavy down and tangled
crop of wheat, it rescued 25 bushels to the acre, which
could not have been got with any other machine.
Also, the I Oft. Sunshine Header which we procured
from you six years ago has given every satisfaction. It
has worked in all classes and conditions of crops, and
took off 2300 acres for the total cost of ss. 6d. for parts.
The wide wheels on both machines make them light
of draught.
We can strongly recommend your Header to those
in need of a good machine.

SCHUTE
BIEILIUtSi
wind after a day’s work. These are only
a few causes.
Founder may be due to bad shoeing,
continuous standing, to a chill after the
horse drinks a lot of very cold water or
to the after-effects of bowel trouble. Rye,
barley and new oats may cause the
ailment.
“Sorghum” advises against bleeding,
but if the shoes are at once taken off,
bleeding allowed from the toe vein of
about two quarts, and the wound bathed
with antiseptic and plugged, there is
little danger. This treatment will reduce
the pain. A bran and crushed linseed or
bread poultice should be applied either
hot or cold. A diuretic will help. A
ball made of two drachms each of pow-
dered resin, nitre and sulphur with some
soft soap will serve.
Although walking will be painful at
first, a little exercise is essential.
THE ’HOPPER MENACE.
“H.U.C.”: “Rone” (B. 17/10/’34) in
describing the mixing of the poison bran
bait for ’hoppers has not got the latest
N.S.W. departmental recommendation,
which gives the procedure as follows:
“Heat in a clean kerosene-tin igal.
water and dissolve the arsenite of soda
in it. Add 2gal. cold water. Add the
41b. molasses to this solution and mix
thoroughly by stirring or pouring the
mixture from one tin to another.”
The essential point is that, when mixed
hot, as he describes, the bait is not so
effective.
Landholders in the central-west are
beginning to realise at long last that in-
dividual effort in dealing with the pest is
inadequate and that Harold Bartlett’s
original plan of State-wide control (men-
tioned by “The 0.D.” in B. 26/9/’34)
should have been adopted.
TOOWOOMBA CANARY GRASS.
“Atriplex”: The feature of a series of
pasture trials conducted on the North
Coast by the N.S.W. Agricultural De-
partment has been the success of Phalaris
tuberosa (Toowoomba canary grass).
This grass is more drought-resistant
and will grow on poorer soils than peren-
nial rye or cocksfoot, which are regarded
by many as the most useful permanent
pastures. Rye in sub-tropical coastal dis-
tricts of N.S.W. and Queensland cannot
live through the long hot summers or
even preserve enough vitality to make
a good second-season growth. Certified
M.L. perennial rye has been the basis of
almost every permanent pasture sown in
these districts in recent years, but it is
now considered that it is inferior in
summer to Phalaris, whilst Phalaris be-
comes more vigorous with age in moder-
ately hot climates.
Phalaris has been grown on the North
Coast of N.S.W. for a number of years
with other grasses, particularly the vigor-
ous annual ryes. It achieved its recent
success sown mixed with clovers and
lucerne.
Colonel White, of Guyra, was the first
man on the N.S.W. tablelands to sow
P. tuberosa —an acre in 1912. He has
now more than 200 acres, and, with Mr.
Simpson, of Stonehenge, was the driving
force behind the recently formed New
England Seed Growers’ Association,
which should soon be producing certified
seed of Phalaris tuberosa in large quan-
tities.
PICKING POSTS.
“Spud Bar”: A fairly reliable rule is
that doubtful timber should be put up
in the place whence it' came ; e.g., mulga
is here to-day and gone to-morrow if
sunk in the black soil of the open downs.
Put into the red soil of its own country,
it is there till the camels come home.
In a country with over a 15in. rainfall
posts of coolibah, bloodwood and the
like are waste of time. They may be
only a memory in 18 months. In areas
with under a 15in. rainfall, both are
good stuff. I know posts of them which
have been up over 50 years. They are
still doing their duty, and though brittle
are as sound as iron.
Gidya and boree are good in most
places. No man living will outlive a
3in. gidya post, bar fires and accidents.
Over years I have found that, using
coolibah or bloodwood in suitable coun-
try, the running posts had to be 4in.
clear of bark at the small end and the
strainers 6in.; gidya and boree 3in. and
sin. respectively.
With softer timbers, it is advisable,
even in dry country, that the posts be
clothed in rough bark —in other words,
use old timber. New growths are cov-
ered with green and grey sappy stuff
which is full of juice, the mother of
decay.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Wrash”: After nailing on palings,
staple galvanised-wire top and bottom
along the lines of nails so that the palings
cannot fall if the nails draw as the
timber shrinks.
“Powiri”: “Bianco” (B. 3 /10/’34) is
right—frequent stirring of cream is
beneficial; but don’t use a wooden
stirrer. Wooden utensils quickly absorb
the fat and serum of cream, and it is
almost impossible to clean them.
“Hornby”: A friend in a badly in-
fested flying-fox district hangs set rabbit
traps on every sixth tree. When a
marauder gets caught, the fuss he raises
causes that tree to be left alone for some
time. After a catch, the orchardist
shifts the trap to another tree, thus mak-
ing a few traps serve a big area. He
lays claim to a 50 p.c. mitigation of the
nuisance.
“Gumblegubbin”: To make a simple
rustic gate with light round timber, use
for the centre rail a piece that has a
strong fork, and fit the prongs into the
hinge end of the gate, either in bored
holes or mortised holes. This acts as a
stay, and if dowelled or bolted the gate
will never sag. Don’t use nails. A rail
with lighter forks may be used to even
the spaces with the prongs in the head-
piece. Choose rails that fork evenly, with
the ends of the prongs the same distance
apart.
“Mercury”: When straining the wires
in a fence the proper method is to strain
the bottom wire first and the top one
last. Reversing this, many fencers find
when they think the job is finished that
the top wire is slack again. It' stands to
reason that the “give” in the posts is
greatest at the top.
“A.G.T.”: To make a weather-proof
copper-stand fireplace cut a hole in the
top of a 40gal. oil-drum to fit the copper.
Cut a smoke-hole 6in. from the top on
the side, and opposite, low down, cut a
fire-hole for draught purposes.
“Booraby”: If you want a bit of good
timber for tool-handles look for water-
gum (the best for axe and pick), marara,
silky oak, handle-wood, crow’s-foot elm,
Queensland hickory, spurwood (for maul
and mallet), yellow-wood, spotted-gum,
waddy-wood, whalebone-tree or white-
ash. The last is a good bending wood
when steamed, and is suitable for shovels.
“Dimon”: A successful German bean-
grower I know never sows his seeds
singly in rows, but in round bunches.
In this way the plants support one
another, and are not easily blown over
and broken by the wind. The clumps
also shade the ground underneath in hot
weather, and thus conserve more mois-
ture than those that are sown in single
file. About half a dozen go to a bunch,
five in a ring round a central plant. The
sowing takes a little longer than the usual
way, but better crops are obtained.
“Yacca”: To make a trestle for slaugh-
tering sheep bend a length of galvanised-
iron to a V-shape and affix to the beaters
from an old harvester and stripper.
Arrange the iron so that one end is
slightly lower than the other. By so
doing you will get the blood to drain
into a receptacle, and you will also be
able to wash the stand.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Has the N.S.W. law been amended to allow
a person without a registered dairy to sell up
to 10 lb. of butter privately per week ? What
is the law regarding the sale of butter ? —3787.
Under the Dairy Industry Act, 1915, it is
necessary for all persons making butter for sale
to register. There is no minimum. Write
to the Agricultural Department for particulars
regarding buildings required for registration
purposes. At the same time apply to the
local policd officer for registration under the
Dairies’ Supervision Act to produce milk
or cream for sale or supply for profit before
making application to register under the Dairy
Industry Act to make butter for sale.
A cure for aphis and codlin moth on a
cabbage crop ? I have tried arsenate of lead
without result. —4010.
Don’t use arsenate of lead. Experiments
have shown that Derris products are effective
for controlling the common cabbage cater-
pillar, and give a satisfactory kill of the cab-
bage aphis. The Derris insecticides require
to be applied at regular intervals during
growth. One single application of even the
most toxic insecticide will not produce satis-
factory results.

Victoria and the centenary itself.
Exhausting the toasts, he drank them
all again, and then continued repeating
them. *
“You must have been in some pretty warm corners,
Admiral.”
He became a centre of interest in the
bar. He began to sing hilariously, and
the toasts became less and less articulate.
At last, when he called for another
mug, the proprietor looked serious.
“I think you’ve had enough,” he said.
“Go to th’ devilsh!” roared the in-
ebriate. “I’ve only had 50 drinksh —hie
—an’ I’m shelebrating a shentenary !”

“PLEASE TO REMEMBER!”
I offer a plea for the late Mr. Guido
Fawkes, for whom I have always enter-
tained a more than sneaking regard.
I submit that, far from being regarded
as an infamous conspirator, he should be
looked upon as a liberator, and his name,
instead of being a synonym for ridicule
and mockery, should be uttered with
reverence.
He was tortured, hanged, drawn and
quartered for the great cause of freedom
in sports and pastimes, his sole offence
being that he
attempted to
let off fire-
works on Guy
Fawkes Day.
Goodness
knows what
they'd have
done to him
had he suc-
ceeded.
The justness
of his cause is
shown by the
fact that to
this very day
children exer-
cise their righi
of lighting
their “crack-
ers” on No-
vember 5, yet
no one ever
sees fit to hang
them, far less draw and quarter them.
Down Fawkes the traitor! Up Saint
Guy, the Children's Friend!
It may be too late to talk of canonis-
ing him, but we can at least compromise
with a few “double hungers” and
“Catherine wheels.”

MODEL ANSWERS FOR NEWLY-
FLEDGED DOCTORS.
Q. —I find it difficult to swallow pills,
doctor. They stick in my throat. What
is this a sign of, and how may I remedy
it ?
A.—Flatfootedness, and • probably a
reflex action from an ingrowing elbow.
Bathe the affected parts with a strong
gargle of stinkwort and ipecacuanha in
which the juice of half a Barcelona nut
has been half squeezed. If this hasn’t the
desired effect, take a sea trip to Italy,
and immediately on landing publicly de-
clare Mussolini a bonehead. They ad-
minister the oil straight from the cask.
Q. —I am becoming alarmed, as a wart
on the end of my nose is getting smaller,
and looks as if it may disappear alto-
gether. What would you advise ?
A. —This condition is sometimes due
to the pernicious habits of plucking the
eyebrows and sleeping with the ears open.
Prune the ends of the wart with a wood
rasp and, with the lips tightly compressed,
hold the nose completely under water
for half an hour. You will have no
further trouble.
Q. —I often see spots before the eyes
What is this due to, doctor ?
A. —Good luck. Keep on seeing them.
Q. —Baby is restless at night and keeps
us awake. We think it is his teeth. What
is. the best thing to do ?
A.—Have the teeth extracted. If you
think the infant may need them later on
give him a gunmetal watch to chew, but
be careful to tie the chain to the cot so
that it can be hauled back in case baby
swallows it (the watch, not the cot).
Alternatively, you could give him a hot
toddy, using half a tumbler of O.P. rum.
If baby gasps, it is a sign that the mix-
ture is slightly strong. You can then
drink it yourself, and in a few minutes
you will not be aware of baby’s crying.

THE “FESTIVE” EVENING.
The resolve to stay at home for once
and go to bed early. The meeting with
Dregs, who tells you he has invited a
few friends —the wife calls them “your
pothouse companions”—round to his
shack. The promise he exacts from you
to be there unfailingly. The regret, based
on experience, that you didn’t invent an
excuse for not accepting.
Your arrival. Your chagrin when you
find that only Dregs and another man
(the suburb’s greatest pest) are there.
Dregs’s assurance (he is always an un-
warrantably hopeful person) that the
others will soon turn up. The agony of
listening to the lies of the suburb’s great-
est bore about the big orders he has
landed, and to his abominable anecdotes.
The continued non-arrival of the
others. Dregs’s pathetic attempts to con-
vince you and himself that they are on
their way.
The bore's unceasing monologues.
Your growing desire to shoot him. Your
invention of a reason for leaving. Your
gloom at having spent such a tedious
hour and your determination never to
let yourself in for anything like that
again. Your sighs of contentment when
you are home and in bed at last.
Your next meeting with Dregs, who is
suffering acutely from morning-afterish-
"Of course, you can write down any words
you’d rather not say.”
"Very well; hut you’ll have to tell me how
to spell them.”
ness and obviously wishes he had never
been born. His woeful attempt to
seem hilarious (groans would more
honestly express his state of stomach
and mind) as he tells you that the boys
all turned up, heavily laden, soon after
you left, and that it was the most' pyja-
gulant party he ever had at his place.

THE COLLECTION.
Who steals my purse steals cash (some-
times), but he who robs my wife of hers
gets some lipsticks, a powder-puff, two
unposted letters, a hair-comb, a medley of
cards containing addresses and telephone
numbers she never remembers she has
when she wants them, a bag of sweets
and several half-finished ones all flavored
with spilt powder, a manicure set, several
unpaid bills and —if she has been to a
bargain sale —4|d. in coppers, a pile of
receipts, and invoices of many things she
will ask me to go in and pay for.

UTOPIA.
They had stretched their legs under
Bill’s kitchen-table, on which stood a
bottle of the best that gurgled anon like
a happy child.
“This ain’t too crook,” pronounced
Bert, wiping his moustache with the back
of a hand. “Not,” he continued a
moment later, “that a man couldn’t be
better orf. Now, take them savages,
that make the old woman do all the
heavy work w’ile they loaf about like
lords. ’Struth! that’d be the life, if a
man c’d stand it.”
“Yairs,” responded Bill, seeing luscious
visions of indolence in the blue pipe-
smoke. “Give me a desert island like,
with plenty grog, tucker and people. It’s
too good f’ damn niggers, I reckon. ’Ere’s
us on the dole ; there’s them in the lap o’
luxury, so t’ speak.”
“Too right,” Bert sighed. “Still, I
don’t ’old altogether with makin’ the
women work like I ’ear some o’ them
natives do. A man’s gotta draw the line
somewhere ’tween himself and them.
That sorta business oughtn’ta be
allowed.”
“Too right it shouldn’t.”
Their meditation of this ticklish point
was interrupted by a sharp voice from
near their feet. “Git outside, both o’
y’, an’ let me git on with this scrubbin’,”
ordered Mrs. Bill.

To take unto myself a bride,

Nor reck what color is her hair.
Her cheeks may pale or rosy be;
It’s frankly all the same to me.

I’ll trouble not whate’er their hue.
Tall she k may be, and even stout,
Or slim and sinuous as a trout.
Yet, not concerned about her looks,

Just this I’ll firmly specify :

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XI. — The Politician.
Blame not the man who, scorning wealth,
Position, rank, applause,
Risks his honor and his health
To frame his country’s law#!
However bad his efforts seem,
He’s no worse than the rest;
And, though his best is very bad,
Vet still it is his best.
Yea, blame him not; because, whate’er
His faults may be, you put him there!
It is hard to understand what induces
men to go in for politics, because, apart
from the salary, the gold pass and the
pickings, there really isn't much in it. It
can’t be a matter of prestige, because
there’s none attached to it; nor can it
be love of power, because, as any poli-
tician will tell you (at election time),
they are merely the servants of the
people.
The attraction may be the letters alter
the name. They are certainly much
easier to get than those denoting profi-
ciency in Law, Medicine, Science or
Accountancy ; but, then, so are 0.8.E5.
Perhaps they enter the game in a spirit
of altruism. “Poor old So-and-so!” they
say. “It’d be a shame to see him in
Parliament. I’ll oppose him and save
him from himself.”
Of course, once a man is in Parlia-
ment he simply has to’ do his best to
stay there, because after three years in
Parliament one is unfit for anything else.
It is not right to say that all politicians
have thick hides. Some of the newer
members are quite thin-skinned, but
once they are elected they soon get over
this.
In bygone days a member was prob-
ably in the House for several months
before he plucked up sufficient courage
to make his first speech. Nowadays, he
interjects right
from the start,
and if he hasn’t
been suspended
or at least
warned by the
Speaker at the
close of the
first day he is
shunned by the
rest of the
party. ■
Parties are
the grown -up
equivalent
of “side s.”
Some parties
pick their own
politicians, and
some politicians
pick their own
parties. Others
again change
their party
when it suits
them. Men have
gone for years
practically un-
known because
they stayed
with the wrong
party. Others
have risen to
the highest posi-
tio n s through
changing to the
right party at
the right time.
When a man
changes his
party he usually
claims that it is
the party that
has changed and that he is still the same.
The party agrees with the latter part of
the sentiment, saying “Bloggins was
always a rat.”
Politicians dress much the same as
other men, except during royal visits.
Their life is not a very difficult one. In
between elections they have very little to
do except interject in Parliament, open
cattle and baby shows and introduce de-
putations, unless, of course, they happen
to be in the Cabinet, in which case they
have to reply to interjections, open cattle
and baby shows and receive deputations.,
besides signing letters and saying “0.K.”
to the suggestions of the heads of their
departments.

Information Sought.
(1) Do aviators fly by the compass or by
landmarks ? (2) What is the maximum speed
at which a survey can be made from a ’plane ?
(3) What would the country look like from a
’plane travelling at 300 m.p.h.—would it be
clear or indistinct ? (4) Have aeroplanes
speedometers, and does a following wind in-
crease speed ? (5) Is it possible to escape
a strong wind at low level by going higher ?
(6) Do ’planes travelling from Perth to Adel-
aide follow the railway line ? —3729.
(1) Both. Over unknown country by com-
pass. If locality is known and ground is
visible, compass can be ignored. (2) Speed
has no effect on the appearance of the ground.
The higher the aircraft the less the speed
appears to be. For example, objects on the
horizon looked at from a moving train appear
stationary in relation to the train, whereas
close ones slip by quickly. (3) Quite clear
at all speeds so far attained. (4) All aero-
planes have an instrument similar to a speedo-
meter that registers the speed of the aircraft
through the air. Ground is covered at air
speed plus or minus velocity of wind, accord-
ing to direction. (5) Yes. (6) Depends on visi-
bility. If the ground cannot be seen compass
courses are flown.
(1) In “Ways of Escape” Philip Gibbs says
that Australia won’t admit a British man or
boy even if his passage is paid. Cannot any
Englishman come to Australia as an immi-
grai\t by paying his own fare ? (2) In the
days when immigration was encouraged, what
selection, if any, was practised amongst (a)
assisted immigrants ? (b) unassisted immigrants ?
—3714.
(1) No restrictions are placed on the entry
to Australia of any Englishman of good char-
acter and sound health in possession of a
valid passport and not likely to become a
charge on the public. (2) Assisted immigrants
were of two classes—(a) “nominated,” i.e.,
residents of the United Kingdom who were
nominated for assisted passages by relatives or
friends in Australia, who undertook to be
responsible for the maintenance and welfare of
their nominees; ( b ) “selected,” these being
mainly farm workers and domestic helpers, for
whom requisitions were submitted by the State
Governments. They were selected by the Com-
monwealth migration organisation at Australia
House. Both classes of assisted immigrants
were required to pass a medical examination
before being granted assisted passages.
(1) What is the duty on worn boots, shoes
and clothing from the U.K.? (2) Is there
such a section as “second-class goods," and
would these articles come under that heading ?
(3) Up to what total value may be charged as
customs duty on unworn boots and shoes from
the U.K.? (4) Is there a fixed rate of value
for these, or may the supervisor of the parcels
department use Iris own discretion ? (5) Why
are some small parcels labelled “duty free” ?
3826.
(1) Worn boots, shoes and clothing are duti-
able under tariff item 110 (D), the rate on such
goods from the United Kingdom being 45 p.c.
less 25 p.c. of the duty for exchange and plus
5 p.c. primage and 5 p.c. sales tax. That item
does not apply to second-hand goods imported
for sale. (2) There is no such section. (3)
The maximum value of second-hand goods that
may be entered under item 110 (D) is £5 in
any one consignment. (4) The declared postal
value is taken as a basis for determining the
value for duty, but the department takes a
very liberal view in assessing the value of worn
clothing for duty purposes. (5) Small parcels
of worn clothing which on examination are
found to be of too small a value for duty pur-
poses are stamped “Duty Free.” That is
merely an intimation to the Postal Department
that the particular parcel may be delivered free
of customs charges.
What is an Apprenticeship Council ? What
is the address of the N.S.W. Council ? —3647.
It is a body constituted under the Industrial
Arbitration Act, consisting of the Apprentice-
ship Commissioner, together with the members
of the Conciliation Committee established for
the industry. The powers of the Apprentice-
ship Council conferred by the Act include the
determination of (a) industries in which appren-
ticeship shall be a condition; ( b ) hours, wages
and conditions of apprentices; (c) limitation of
all apprentices; (d) technical education of
apprentices; (e) generally to control and direct
the conditions of apprenticeship in any indus-
try. The address of the Apprenticeship Com-
missioner is 142 Phillip-street, Sydney.
What is Fletcherism, and how is it practised ?
—4045.
A method of diet based on thorough masti-
cation of food; named after Horace Fletcher,
American dietitian. The theory is that food
chewed slowly and thoroughly masticated by
the teeth gives the maximum of satisfaction with
the minimum of food. In contrast to bolting
large amounts of food this procedure benefits
digestion, and as a slimming process it entails
no special diet. Dr. W. G. Anderson (U.S.A.)
describes a similar treatment under the title of
“How to Reduce by Eating.”
I have lost a number of teeth from upper
jaw and contemplate getting a dental plate
made. (1) Will the friction of the plate wear
the remaining teeth and cause decay ? (2) If
so, how long can I expect to retain my natural
upper teeth —I am 35 ? (3) Must a dental plate
come into direct contact with remaining natural
teeth ? (4) Is it advisable to have devitalised
teeth extracted ? —3922.
(1) Sound teeth are best retained. These
serve to anchor the plate by band or open-
bridge attachment. (2) Correct treatment avoids
friction that would initiate decay; oral cleanli-
ness is essential in any case. (3) Requirement
of direct contact depends upon position ol
sound teeth; the denture must be steadied to
equalise the bite. (4) Yes. Septic absorption
commonly results from dead teeth. Remote
toxic lesions, rheumatism, etc., arc indica-
tions.
How many teeth should a woman have, and
when does a child get permanent teeth ?
4058.
Adult dentition consists of 32 teeth; 16
each in upper and lower jaw. The temporary
or milk teeth of childhood are usually cut
by the end of the second year. About the
sixth or seventh year the permanent teeth begin
to appear, and at 13 all except the last four
molars (wisdom teeth) usually develop. The
latter may not appear till 25 or 30 years of
age.
My daughter, aged 24, has goitre. Two
doctors suggest operation. Two are against it.
Had basal metabolism test taken. Is the iodine
treatment satisfactory, and is there any other
treatment ? Can nerves cause goitre ?— 4OBO.
The favorable cases for non-operative treat-
ment are those of simple goitre or enlarged
thyroid gland. With excess fibrous tissue
growth operation may be necessary for relief
of cardiac and bronchial obstruction. In the
stated case, much depends upon results obtained
from the basal metabolism test. lodine, both
internally and externally, is of service in the
early stages; this may be supplemented by
X-ray, radium, electricity, etc. Contrary to
your suggestion, goitre may aggravate nerve
faults, neurasthenia, etc.
The names of leaders and members of the
parties of police constables who were out in
search of the Clarke brothers, bushrangers ?
—3885.
The Clarke brothers were captured on April
27, 1867, by Senior Constable William, Wright,
in whose party were Constables William Walsh,
Edmund Egan, Lenehan and James Wright,, and
Sir Watkin (black-tracker). During the en-
counter between these constables and the bush-
rangers, reinforcements were sent for, and
Sergeant Byrne and six additional troopers
(names not recorded) arrived. The bushrangers
were taken to Ballalaba, where they were met
by another party of police (names not re-
corded), under Superintendent Orridge, and
Dr. Patterson.
(1) Qualifications of an art director for a
film studio ? (2) Which country, from a purely
artistic viewpoint, produces the finest motion
pictures ? —3724.
(1) Sufficient knowledge of drawing and color
to layout settings; a knowledge of the material
to be used in their construction. In Australia,
where few and small sets are only needed, the
art director has to have a knowledge of car-
pentry and all the matters that enter into set
construction. (2) France, Russia and Germany
are considered the leaders; but it’s a matter
of taste.
Meaning of (1) “Sic fortis Etruria crevit (2)
“Sapere aude”; (3) “Pro ecclesia Dei humilitas,
virtus, probitas” ? —3BBB.
(1) “Thus Etruria waxed strong.” (2) “Dare
to be wise.” (3) “For the Church of God
humbleness, courage, uprightness.”
(1) Where was Dr. Norman Haire, of Harley-
street, London, born ? (2) Where educated ?
(3) What degrees does he hold ? (4) Outline
of his work and movements since graduation ?
—3677.
(1) Sydney, 1892. (2) Fort-street school,
Sydney. (3) M. 8., Ch.M., 1915, University of
Sydney. (4) After various appointments in hos-
pitals in N.S.W., including Sydney Hospital, he
went to London (1919) and became Casualty
Physician and House Surgeon at the Hamp-
stead General Hospital, Clinical Assistant
London Lock Hospital and Hon. Medical
Officer, Saffron Hill Maternity Centre. Ever
since he has taken an active part in the birth-
control movement, made a study of contra-
ceptive methods in European countries, and in
1921 was one of the founders and medical
officer-in-charge of the Walworth Welfare
Centre, the first British welfare centre to give
contraceptive advice to its patients. He is the
author of several books and assistant editor
of “Sexus.”
Any sale for used Australian stamps, some
dating back to 1914 ? —3618.
The lower values have practically no sale.
Commemorative issues and higher values may
be sold to dealers by the dozen or by the
hundred. Try J. C. Wood, 4 Charnwood-road,
St. Kilda, Vic.; D. A. MacDonald, 326 Little
Collins-street, Melbourne; or W. H. Pethard,
109 Victoria-road, Northcote South, N. 16, Mel-
bourne.
How did Galston and Cessnock, N.S.W.,
come by their names ? —3990.
Galston district was originally known as
North Colah. In 1886 a movement was set
on foot to obtain a postal receiving office. The
move was successful, but, owing to confusion
between North and South Colah, a public
meeting was called to change the name. Alex.
Hutchinson suggested that Galston (the name
of a village in Scotland) be substituted for
North Colah, and the suggestion was adopted.
The change of name was made about the
middle of 1887. David Campbell named his
grant of 2560 acres Cessnock after his ances-
tral home near Galston, Ayrshire, Scotland.
Author of the following lines, and title of
the poem in which they appear:
And when the last great Scorer conies
To write against your name,
He’ll ask not if you’ve won or lost
But how you’ve played the game.
—3958.
Grantland Rice, contemporary American
poet, in “The Game.”
After whom were Hunter’s Hill and Hunter’s
Quay, etc., in Sydney, named, and why were
these localities given the name ? —3924.
It is generally accepted that Hunter’s Hill
was named by Thomas Muir, one of the “Scot-
tish martyrs,” after his father’s home in Glas-
gow. No place known as Hunter’s Quay is
known in Sydney.
(1) My kitchen (at Ramies, Q.) is unaccount-
ably hot. Would a larger chimney remedy
matters ? (2) Is the citric acid sold by grocers
made only from citrus fruit, and is it as whole-
some as fresh citrus ? (3) Is tartaric acid whole-
some ? —3967.
(!) A larger chimney would possibly keep
the room cooler, but would do so at the ex-
pense of loss of cooking heat, which might prove
inconvenient. If the stovepipe or part of flue
is bare, insulate it with sheets of asbestos, or
have all hot parts bricked in as much as pos-
sible. Do your cooking in the morning as
much as you can, and let the stove go out
after lunch. (2) Citric acid is mostly pre-
pared from limes or lemons, but is obtained
also from other acid fruits and from glu-
cose. Fresh citrus fruits are much more
valuable as a source of this acid than the com-
mercial powder, which is sometimes adulterated.
(3) Tartaric acid is wholesome if used
only as directed in good recipes, but like all
other commercial’ acids should be used spar-
ingly and not allowed to become a habit; its
overuse may cause gastritis.
Recipe for making dog-biscuits ? Should
ground green-bone be one of the ingredients;
where can it be obtained? —4013.
Bonemeal is not necessary, as it is better
for dogs to obtain their bone rations by chew-
ing bones, which are also good for their teeth.
If you wish to add ground bones, it is better
to make than to buy it; a small green-bone
cutter such as poultry-farmers use may be
bought at any hardware shop: the bones used
must be fresh and sweet. To make the bis-
cuits, mince finely any good cooked meat, free
of fat, and dry it in the oven on sheets of
paper. Then roll it and make it as powdery
as possible. Take equal parts of flour and
powdered meat, add a little salt, bonemeal if
liked, and a little baking powder. Mix with
water to a stiff dough* roll out, cut into
oblong biscuit shapes, and bake in a moderate
oven. Store in an airtight tin. Use a greater
proportion of meat if preferred.
How to solder aluminium saucepans and
similar goods, flux required and any useful
information concerning this soldering ? I can
solder other metals, but not aluminium. —3983.
The only recognised process requires use of
a nickelled soldering-iron and a solder com-
posed of two parts lead by weight, one part
bismuth, one part aluminium and two parts
tin. Any usual flux is used. It has been
stated that the use of aluminium paint as a
combined flux and solder makes this operation
easy.
How to make unbleached calico waterproof
for camping ground-sheet ? —4006.
Place one quart best boiled linseed oil in a
tin over a closed fire, whisk in 4oz. yellow soap
which has been shredded and covered with
boiling water to form a jelly, and add also
one dessertspoon powdered alum. Keep the
mixture hot until wanted; it can be made
black by adding a little lampblack. Wring
the calico out in water, hang it up to drain,
and while still damp, but not dripping, lay out
on a table and paint with one coat of the ■
hot oil. Allow to dry thoroughly, then give
a second coating, and then a third if neces-
sary. If not dried well between the oil appli-
cations it will be sticky.
(1) How to clean a while marble headstone
which has gong discolored with weather con-
ditions ? (2) To clean a white porcelain enamel
bath ? (3) To dry-clean cream gabardine
trousers ?— 4029.
(1) Scrub with hot soapy water containing
cloudy ammonia, using sandsoap if the stone
is very dirty. When dry, clean with powdered
chalk and water and polish off well. Finally,
as a preservative, rub with white wax dissolved
in turpentine and polish thoroughly with a dry
cloth. Marble varies greatly in quality, and it
may be difficult to clean the stone if it is of
a porous nature. (2) Put a few inches of hot
water in the bath and add a handful of soap
flakes. Take a flannel, sprinkle with Bon Ami
or similar powder, and with the aid of the hot
soapy water scour the sides and bottom
thoroughly. Rinse well with cold water. Then
dip a flannel in kerosene and again scour the
interior of the bath. Polish dry with a clean
dry cloth. The bath may be kept in good con-
dition by a daily rubbing with kerosene. (3)
Gabardine is a very difficult material to clean,
and you are not likely to have much success
with it by home methods. Spread the garment
out on a table, brush it well and then cover
the soiled parts with bran which has been made
very hot in the oven. Roll up quickly, set aside
for an hour, then brush well again. A magnesia
cleaning block, obtainable from the chemist,
may then be used; rub with the block, and
brush with a clean brush.

That ugly mask creeps over teeth and robs them
of all sparkle —discolours them with stains
from food and smoking—finally destroys them.
FILM is a dull, dingy coating on your
teeth. And it’s that film —and
nothing else—which keeps your smile
from gleaming like your favourite
movie star’s. That’s why your most
important beauty treatment is to
remove stained, ugly film from teeth
effectively—and safely.
Film is the greatest single source of
most tooth trouble. Film forms on teeth
in coats —stubborn, clinging. It is laden
with acid-producing germs that dissolve
the tooth’s enamel. It can lead to many
serious disorders. Hence, removing film
effectively, and at the same time safely,
is the object of all scientific tooth pastes.
How safe is it ?
A revolutionary cleansing and polishing
material is contained in Pepsodent that
removes film— differently. This material
polishes away stained, unattractive film.
PEPSODENT
the special film-removing tooth paste
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
Then it polishes tooth enamel to new
and brilliant lustre. And, above all, this
new cleansing-polishing material is abso-
lutely safe . . , safe because it’s twice
as soft as that in common use. It is by
far the softest used in any leading tooth
paste. That’s why Pepsodent is safe for
children as well as for adults.
It is the newly-discovered polishing
material that makes Pepsodent so differ-
ent from all other tooth pastes. If you
would have Pepsodent results you must
use only Pepsodent to get them.

“Spark”: In Dec., 1901, my regiment,
the sth Q.T.8., was returning from a 48-
hours’ raid in the country round No. 4
post on the Wakkerstroom (South Africa)
blockhouse line. For several hours we rode
through the most teeming rain and the
most vicious series of thunderstorms I
have seen in South Africa. The light-
ning was splashing up the water as it
struck the ground. All were soaked to
the skin. One man in a column of fours
in my troop had picked up a wooden
fence-post and was carrying it on his
shoulder—soaked as much as himself, of
course —when a flash of lightning struck
it. Riding 25 yards out on the flank, 1
felt the flash and heat on my cheek as if
a furnace door had been opened and
shut. The fence-post was shattered to
pieces ; the man and horse dropped like
logs. The section of four was riding
“knee to knee,” and no other man felt
more than the heat and the blindness
from the flash. The stricken man and
his horse were reported by their respec-
tive quacks as badly shaken but fit for
duty—we were very short of men and
gees in those days. Among those who
will bear my yarn out are Major-General
Tom Dodds, then adjutant of the regi-
ment, Colonel-Toll and others.

THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DRIVING.
SAFETY-FIRST METHODS MUST BE STUDIED.
BY FRED BERRY.
THOUGH the modem car is, in a mechanical sense, almost
foolproof and may, by reason of improved gear systems
and automatic devices, be operated without preliminary experi-
ence, the safety of driver and passengers as well as all other
road users is more than ever dependent upon the human
element.
Speeds in excess of 60 m.p.h. are now possible with
practically every stock model, and new drivers or those new to
the later types of car must realise that unless they make a very
careful study of driving methods they will be a source of danger
on the highways and, furthermore, their motoring will almost
certainly cost them more than it should otherwise do.
If driving is merely to be treated as
a means of getting somewhere, as long
as gears can be engaged and the car
made to go the rest does not matter.
But if the driver desires freedom from
trouble and a lifelong interest and
pleasure in motoring he must take the
trouble to learn what is going on under
the bonnet and study intelligently the
problems of driving. The car must be
visualised as something alive, something
to be humored when the occasion war-
rants, and it must be realised that every
little care and consideration bestowed

spectators watched the event.
upon it will be repaid many times in
terms of service and reliability.
Safety First.
In the first place, the driver’s mind
must be made up to play for safety every
time and all the time. No person can
be classified as a good driver unless he
invariably acts upon safety-first prin-
ciples. Even the successful racing and
competition motorist keeps this principle
continually before him. While driving
a racing car at 100 miles an hour in-
volves greater hazard than would be the
case when touring at 30, these high
speeds are done only in selected places
with specially-equipped machines, and
the risk incurred mainly concerns the
driver himself—no other is likely to
suffer.
Racing is the sporting motorist’s
hobby, and at the proper time and in the
right place he swoops round the track
or up a difficult hill-climb in a glorious
and thrilling “blind.” Put this same
driver in a touring-car amongst busy
traffic and you will see a different being.
He will almost certainly be careful and
considerate, and will be passed on many
occasions by inexperienced and less skil-
ful drivers. Under ordinary conditions
he is prone to err on the cautious side,
but he will never be guilty of committing
any of those rash or selfish acts so com-
mon with newchum drivers.
Risks of Fast Driving.
Actually, there is no merit in or reason
for fast driving in congested traffic. It
gets one nowhere, and only serves to
bring motorists generally into disrepute
with other road users.
Of course, there is the other extreme —
the over-cautious driver. He is almost
as dangerous and quite as big a nuis-
ance as the bustler ; a fruitful cause of
The eight stages of automobile design, with the “Motor’s” version of the future
sedan.
traffic congestion in busy centres. He
can usually be identified by a squashed
tail-light and dented rear mudguards.
The secret of good driving is to adopt
the middle course. The hard road of
experience, involving many hours at the
wheel, must be followed, coupled with
a careful study of the innumerable diffi-
cult situations that arise from time to
time and the correct methods to adopt
in handling them.
Everyone should cultivate the habit of
correctly judging distance and speed, for
in these two factors lies the key to success
in motoring, together with freedom from
accident. Driving in traffic involves pre-
cise assessments of distance and speed,
and if in the earlier stages of driving ex-
perience these facts are borne in mind a
safe and confident style will rapidly be
developed.
Novice drivers must of necessity pass
through a transient period wherein they
emerge gradually from a tense atmo-
sphere of mental concentration to sub-
conscious skill. This is an extremely
dange'rous period, for restraint and self-
control are essential in order to avoid
accidents due to over-confidence.
After a time (varying, of course, with
individual capacity) all doubts as to posi-
tion and use of controls will vanish and
driving will become automatic, and then
the motorist will appear in his true
colors, for at this stage a characteristic
style will be developed.
Keep Calm.
In few walks of life is a man’s true
character so quickly and completely re-
vealed as when at the wheel of his car,
for when driving in traffic there are so
many pinpricks and irritating incidents
that ample opportunity is presented for
the exhibition of any natural weakness.
Exhibitions of bad temper are sheer folly,
.serving only to embarrass the offending
party and bring ridicule upon him with-
out possibility of compensating benefits.
When driving the high-powered and
extremely fast motors of to-day both
novices and experienced motorists are
prone to boast of extraordinary average
speeds over a day’s journey, and in this
regard a timely warning must be given.
The car in question may be able to do
between 60 and 70 m.p.h. over a mea-
sured mile, but a much slower car in
the hands of a skilful driver will in all
probability establish a better average on
a l° n g journey,
Average speeds and petrol consump-
tion are too frequently comparable wi
fishermen's yarns. Drivers must be re-
minded that each mile is 1760 yards,
not what they guess it to be, what the
speedometer says it is, or what the
road map may indicate, as competition
drivers have learned by bitter experi-
ence. In cases where distances are guessed
it is but human nature to give oneself
the benefit of odd half miles, which,
incidentally, will make a vast difference
in computing averages.
Speedometer Errors.
Again, if speedometer readings are to
be used, one must realise that these in-
struments are seldom accurate, and even
when carefully calibrated a month’s tyre
wear or a variation in loading or speed
will make an appreciable difference. The
trip-mileage and miles-per-hour record-
ings of any instrument are entirely
separate functions. As a general rule
the error begins after 30 m.p.h., and at
50 the dial may read from 5 p.c. to 15
p.c. faster, while at maximum road
speed the error is correspondingly greater.
Hints for Amateur Mechanics.
How not to use a shifting spanner.
End on to the nut jaws will be
spread. Lay the spanner side on and
turn in a clockwise direction.
In one particular instance during a test
over The Bulletin course the speed-
ometer showed 90 m.p.h. when, calcu-
lated against the stop-watch, actual speed
was 76 m.p.h. Trip records seldom vary
to this extent, but, for purposes of assess-
ing averages, cannot be accepted with-
out question.
Returning now to the practical angle
of driving, motorists are advised that,
while there is no royal road to learning,
possibly the shortest route to efficient
operation and the assimilation of safety-
first practices is either to enter organised

Study of 'Driving Methods.
Motoring is definitely an applied
science, and, as with golf, tennis, cricket
and similar sports wherein skill enters
into calculations, a distinct improvement
will follow a careful study of experts’
methods. Any intelligent driver will
learn more valuable points by watching
or taking part in two or three well-
conducted contests than he would in five
years’ aimless and casual pottering about
the roads. Finally, the driver must at
all times look upon the traffic police as
his friends and not, as is too often the
case, his natural enemies. Their lot is
considerably harder than that of indi-
vidual drivers, and their mission is to con-
trol vehicles for the benefit of all road
users.
Without’ this restraining influence such
a state of chaos would exist that the life
of a decent motorist would be intoler-
able. Every driver should, therefore,
shoulder his responsibility to all users of
the public highways, and at all times and
in all circumstances act as if he were
under official observation. Then driv-
ing will be as it should —safe, educative
and pleasure-giving.
Amazing Long-distance Record by
Jenkins.
Having had a batch of international
long-distance records only recently con-
firmed, and that after considerable discus-
sion, Albert Jenkins (U.S.A.), driving on
the Salt Lake Course, Utah, has again
knocked such records to pieces. Every
distance between 200 kilometres and
3000 miles is claimed at an average speed
of 130 m.p.h. Now John Cobb, British
driving ace, is girding up his loins, and
has decided to take over to Salt Lake
City his record-breaking Napier and see
what can be done about these new
figures.
International Records Broken by
New British Car.
Last year a group of English racing
drivers, fed-up with the monotonous
victories of Continental cars in all classic
road races, set out without trade assist-
ance to form a syndicate and design a
fleet of racers in the 1000 and 1500-c.c.
group to regain British prestige.
Delayed in production by various
causes until late in last season, the most
that could be done was to compete in
sundry minor events before the winter
put a stop to competitions. Now, almost
before the summer season begins, the
E.R.A.’s, as the new cars are named,
have made a brilliant start by establish-
ing a set of records on Brooklands.
Humphrey Cook and Raymond Mays,
driving 1100-c.c. and 1500-c.c. E.R.A.’s,
cleaned up standing-start records for
class G and F respectively. Cook’s time
on the 1100-c.c. outfit for a standing-
start mile worked out at 88.91 m.p.h.,
while Raymond Mays in the 1500-c.c.
group clocked 96.08 m.p.h., crossing the
finishing line at over 130 m.p.h.
Continental drivers will have to pull
up their socks if they hope to continue
their winning sequence.
Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom centre in
technical or abstract features, but rather in personal experiences or
achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over specified
routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the present mechanical
condition of cars after years of use are matters of extreme interest. Huge
annual mileages, old driving licenses, and perhaps low car numbers support
claims .to experience, while many drivers, with characteristic Australian
ingenuity, have made interesting emergency repairs.
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver covers the
greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been confined to
racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic, hundreds of miles from
repair shops, has worked miracles in order to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and recount their
experiences.
To Toot or Not to Toot?
The Minister of Transport in England,
after an extensive tour of the country,
has issued an edict that the silent-zone
scheme, already instituted in major cities,
is to be extended to cover the entire
country. Now in any city or hamlet
where lamp-posts are placed not over
200 yards apart (definition of built-up
area) the sounding of an automobile
horn between 11.30 p.m. and 7 a.m. will
be regarded as an offence. The scheme
has met with a mixed reception among
influential motorists, Lord Nuffield, of
Morris fame, being entirely in accord
with the plan, while Sir Herbert Austin
issues a grave warning as to possible
repercussions.
While admitting that the average
driver makes far too generous use of the
horn, yet, logically, those drivers of
mature experience who have perforce
driven through congested traffic with
the warning device out of action realise
exactly what the possibilities may be if
the silent-zone principle is rigorously
enforced. The immediate effect from a
practical standpoint will be to slow down
vehicular traffic to such an extent that
the consequent congestion will introduce
a far more serious problem.
Actually, the immediate effect of ban-
ning motor-horns in London streets
between set hours at night was that
drivers were forced for safety sake to
proceed at' little more than a walking
pace. Such a scheme, extended through-
out the entire country and applied to
all hours, will inevitably entail confusion
and delay.
Another aspect of the problem is that
the authorities responsible for the new
regulation have failed to view the subject
of noise in its true perspective, the motor,
as in many previous enactments, being
singled out for invidious attention.
In almost every city and town it is the
custom for civic enterprises of what-
ever nature to carry out repair and main-
tenance work during the hours of dark-
ness. So we find trip hammers, pave-
ment breakers, pneumatic drills and
metal riveters splitting the ear with their
vicious din ; yet the automobile is not
permitted to toot its warning of approach
on the selfsame highway.
It would, of course, be a wonderful
achievement for city and suburban resi-
dents if the ideal of silent zones could
be achieved —it was tried in Macquarie-
street, Sydney, for some little time, and
kept the night staff of the Sydney Hos-
pital busy—but it is utterly absurd to
begin with motor-horns. First, the autho-
rities must stop the noises set up by
trams, repair gangs and milk waggons,
and, to make the position thoroughly
secure, the gag must be applied to night
revellers on the way home from the
party.

H.E.D. (Cooma, N.S.W.).— My 1931 Stude-
baker is fitted with free-wheel, and when the
gear lever is in top with free-wheeling in
action the gear lever flies out into neutral.
Cause and remedy ?
Check shaft alignment in gearbox and remove
end play if of any magnitude. Ascertain also if
ball fitting into slot on selector rod is central
when gear lever is in top, and try fitting a
stronger tension spring to hold it in place.
J.B. (Beech Forest, Vic.). —(1) Which wheels
of a car tend to rise when cornering ? Why
are roads banked on corners ?
The inside wheels tend to lift when corner-
ing due to change in centre of gravity and cen-
trifugal force; consequently the roadway is
built up on the outside on corners.
W.C. (Berala, Vic.). — There is a distinct
rumbling in the differential of my 509 Fiat,
and, after a little running, the housing round
the crown wheel and pinion gets warm. What
should be done ?
The thrust race is now so badly worn as
to throw the pinion out of correct alignment;
consequently the teeth of wheel and pinion are
meshing too tightly under load, generating heat
and imposing an excessive load on the assembly.
N.O'B. (Forbes, N.S.W.).— My 1927 Chev.
has recently been completely overhauled. The
motor has been rebored and new pistons and
bearings fitted. The car is now pulling splen-
didly, but a knock is now tioticeable so me -
where in the crankcase. Cause and remedy ?
After the overhaul the engine would natu-
rally run more smoothly and quietly than pre-
viously, so that any part missed in the over-
haul may now be distinctly detected it badly
worn. Suggest you inspect the mechanical
oil pump, and either reline the oil-pump
housing to compensate for wear or fit a com-
p,ete new gear and housing ’
_ Output (Launceston, las.). What is the
difference between R.A.C. horse-power and
brake-horsepower; also why do not catalogues
state indicated horse-power, as was the custom
with steam plants ?
R.A.C. rating is possibly the most absurd
and antiquated mechanical term in use at the
present time. It is arrived at with only diameter
of cylinder bore and number of cylinders as
factors, stroke and crankshaft speed, two vital
factors, being left out of calculation. Brake-
horsepower is a definite measurement of overall
power output at the flywheel, these measurements
being made either by Froudc water brake or
Dynomometer. Brake-horsepower output is in-
variably quoted at definite revs, per minute.
Indicated horse-power merely denotes actual
power developed by gases exploding in the
cylinders, and does not take into account
mechanical efficiency.
T.B. (Hamilton, N.S.W.). — l have a spare !
accumulator from which the battery acid has j
been spilled. What proportions of acid and
water should be added before it can again |
be charged ?
Use pure sulphuric acid one part, and dis-
tilled water three parts, the specific gravity
when cooled reading 1.280. Be careful when
mixing to pour into glass or porcelain vessels,
and add acid slowly to water; never pour the
water on concentrated acid, for the ensuing j
violent reaction will be fraught with grave per-
sonal risk.
H.B. (Gunnedah, N.S.W.). — Recently my car
has developed a habit of throwing oil on the
brake drums, the result being that 1 never know
when brakes are likely to fail. Can the trouble
be remedied without going to any great ex-
pense ?
This defect is due solely to wear. The rear
axle shafts, although fitted with oil-retaining
washers and left- arid right-hand channels,
get slack after lengthy use, the result being that
oil works along from the differential, enters
the brake drum and is thrown up on the brake
shoes. Only inexpensive cure is to fit new j
oil-retaining washers, but at best this is only
a temporary repair. New bearings should be
fitted.
Olds (Toowoomba, Q.). — My 6-cyl. car of I
well-known American make has given wonder-'
ful service for 72,000 miles. At 55,000 / had 1
the engine rebored, but since then l have
“run” No. 4 big-end bearing on three occasions.
Rods and shaft are true, and bearings fitted
by expert mechanics. Why should this par-
ticular bearing break down, and what is the
remedy ?
Provided the mechanical work has been skil-
fully carried out and all reciprocating parts
are true the trouble must be due to failure of
lubrication. Suggest you dismantle the hollow
crankshaft and have the oilways blown out
under pressure and thoroughly cleaned of
emulsified oil and sludge.

A “NEW SERIES” BROADCAST
SUPERHETERODYNE.
Incorporating Latest Valves and Current Engineering Practices in Design
BY DON B. KNOCK.
The average set-constructor is more concerned with the actual perform-
ance of the receiver than with the theory underlying its design. When it
comes to theory there are only five fundamental receiving circuits, and
many alleged new improvements and ideas are mere adaptations or contain
minor alterations to what is otherwise current engineering practice.
In the receiver to be described there is nothing revolutionary, though
perhaps the audio side is rather unusual; but it is an amalgamation of
trusted principles in superheterodyne construction. Results, moreover, will
depend solely upon layout, close adjustment and matching of quality
parts. A receiver is no better than irs weakest part, so good components
are essential.
Circuit Details.
Referring to the schematic diagram it
will be noticed that a 6D6 valve is used
as a radio-frequency amplifier, a 6C6
valve as first detector and oscillator, a
6D6 as intermediate amplifier, a 687 as
second detector, and two 42 valves in
push-pull as audio-frequency amplifiers.
Instead of using a separate oscillator
and first detector, the autodyne system,
having the one valve for the dual pur-
pose, has been incorporated. This not
only makes a saving in first cost, but is
also in every way just as efficient as the
Showing the layout of the “New Series” 6/7 superheterodyne
chassis.
separate oscillator, and, if anything,
slightly better in sensitivity and selec-
tivity. With good valves and good com-
ponents, the autodyne always proves
itself satisfactory.
Volume is controlled by a 2500-ohm
wire-wound potentiometer, which varies

the bias on the intermediate amplifying
valve and is connected so that it shorts
out the aerial when the volume is right
off and has its full resistance across the
aerial with the volume full on —the full
resistance across the aerial does not have
any appreciable effect upon signal
strength.
The new 687 valve is used as the
second detector, and it will be noticed
that the screen grid and plate are tied
together. Provision here has been made
for a pick-up to be incorporated.
It will be noticed that the screen grid
of the detector valve has been tied to
the plate. This is to equalise the input
voltage supplied to the grids of the two
42 audio amplifying valves in push pull.
If the screen was connected to a separate
resistor it would mean that only the
plate-current variations would be im-
pressed on the grid of the 42 valve, with
the sum of the
screen and plate-
current variations
impressed on the
other valve. Thus
distortion of the
audio output would
result.
Resistance coqp-
ling for the push-
pull amplifiers has
been used, as it was
considered that it
would give im-
proved quality of
reproduction. This
part of the circuit
is self-explanatory.
The power-supply
arrangements are
of standard de-
sign, requiring no
special mention.
A filter choke has been dispensed with, as
it was found that the field coil of the
speaker is sufficient to smooth out any
ripple.
Components.
Of the components incorporated, it
has been found that most of the 6/7
superheterodyne coil kits obtainable
will suit. A Lekmek kit is used in this in-
stance with a Stromberg-Carlson three-
gang condenser. The chassis measures
164 in. by 9|in. and is of the usual sheet-
steel kind. The power transformer is a
standard production, obtainable at any
good dealer’s.
The components call for no special
mention. The resistors and condensers
are standard, and the products of any
reputable manufacturer will be satisfac-
tory.
Chassis Assembly.
The illustrations show the general lay-
out and arrangement of components on
the chassis. It will be noticed from the
top view how the various parts are fixed
in position ; but the components on the
sub-base are not fixed until the wiring
is commenced.
Unless one is looking for considerable
labor it will be advisable to have the
larger holes on the chassis drilled by
some radio engineering firm. Care must

volume are the only controls.
be taken to see that the holes are in the
right position. A good plan is to supply
a paper template upon which all the
top components have been laid out first
in test, but provision must he made for
adjusting the padder. A hole for this
purpose is drilled at the back of the
gang condensers to the right. This is
shown in the top view of the receiver.
In commencing the assembly the three-
gang condensers occupy the centre of
the top of the chassis, with the poten-
tiometer volume control directly under-
neath it. With the condensers provision
is made for the mounting of the sup-
port for the tuning dial. Working from
the centre outwards, the remaining com-
ponents are fixed in position.
First, the valve-sockets and shield-
bases are bolted in place, together
with the speaker-socket and pick-up ter-
minals, at the back of the panel. Next,
the coils are mounted, though their
shields will be secured during the wir-
ing. Finally, the electrolytic condensers
and power transformer are bolted in their
respective positions.
The 280 rectifying valve is mounted
directly behind the transformer, with the
two 42-type A.F. amplifiers behind the
rectifier. On the extreme right, the front
shield covers the 6D6 R.F. valve, and
the 6C6 valve is next, the first inter-
mediate transformer behind this and the
6D6 intermediate amplifying valve at
the back of the chassis.
The second row of cans next to the
tuning condensers contains the tuning
coil in front, the R.F. coil in the middle,
and the oscillator coil at the back. Behind
the condenser bank is the second inter-
mediate frequency transformer and the
687 second detector valve.
Wiring.
in the wiring there is nothing trouble-
some, and procedure is comparatively
simple and straightforward. The illus-
tration shows the main leads and the
general arrangement of fixed condensers
and resistors. When commencing this
phase of construction, the heater wiring
is done first. Twisted flex must be used,
and this presents no difficulty.
With filament wiring completed, com-
mence at the aerial terminal and connect
up the component parts in accordance
with the schematic circuit diagram, wir-
ing the input and output of each valve
in turn, and finishing with the power
supply. Only one shielded cable is used,
and this connects the oscillator coil to
the I.F. transformer. Provision is made
for a pick-up in the detector circuit, and
these leads are taken to two terminals
at the back of the chassis. In following
the schematic circuit, the various resis-
tors and fixed condensers remain in posi-
tion because of the soldered joints and
connecting wires.
Having completed all wiring, go over
each connection and see that it is solid,
removing any solder or flux which may
have dropped on some part of the
chassis; and see that all huts and
bolts are securely in position. There
are a few points to be watched. In
the first place the grid clips on top of
the valves must make good contact.
To ensure this, bend the springs
slightly. All valve shields must fit
snugly, and coil cans should be fixed
securely in position.
Lining-up. •
If one has access to a properly-
constructed oscillator, the process of
lining-up is simplified, but in most
cases the only practicable method is
to use the regular broadcast stations
for lining purposes.
In the first case, unscrew the trim-
mer on the oscillator section of the
gang condenser, for it is best to work
with as little trimmer capacity as pos-
sible on the oscillator gang. Adjust
the trimmers to about the middle of
their movement, and tune to a low wave-
length station, such as (in Sydney) 2UW
or 2CH. With a trimmer tool, adjust the
trimmers for maximum signal strength,

all the while rocking the dial slightly. If
the trimmers will not peak, screw in the
trimmer on the oscillator gang a little at
a time until the peak is obtained.
Next, tune to a higher wave-length
station, such as 2FC, at the upper end
of the band, and adjust the padder con-
denser trimmer for maximum sensitivity.
Again the dial is rocked to and fro over
this station.
The set should now be correctly
aligned, though finer adjustments may
be required for long-distance stations. It
may be found desirable to readjust at
the lower end of the dial and return again
to the higher, in order that as fine an
adjustment as possible may be obtained.
Final adjustments can be made with
more distant stations.
Performance.
On test this receiver has been found
to be most satisfactory, having excellent
tone, a good degree of selectivity with
maximum sensitivity. Stations through-
out Australia and Maoriland are heard,
and the job comes through every test.
In tuning it is necessary to be right
on the station desired, for, if the tuning is
a little off the station and the volume
control fully advanced to obtain fair
signal strength, the set will be most sen-
sitive to noise, and distortion will be
introduced. The volume control should
always be set at the minimum position
and the dial adjusted to exactly tune
to the desired station.
A final word about adjustments. Once
the set has proved satisfactory, do not
meddle with condensers, etc., to see
whether a little extra can be obtained.
This receiver is designed to be very selec-
tive with maximum sensitivity, and once
correctly aligned will tune in the many
broadcasting stations with certainty.

UNCLE HENRY AND “TREASURE ISLAND.”
Gentle reader, is your home subject
to invasions by an Uncle Henry? Ours
is. Our Uncle Henry is one of those
enviable chaps who, in a world of Ein-
steinian doubt, where old-fashioned faiths
crash to their doom at the rate of one
every six minutes, remains perfectly
cocksure. I never in my life did anything
but what Uncle Henry could show me
how I could have done it much better.
I never expressed an opinion in his hear-
ing when he could not either controvert
it or show that I had formed it on
entirely wrong premises. Being a bachelor
he is, of course, a whale on the nurture,
education and upbringing of the young.
When he strolled in the other evening he
found my youngster Charles with his ear
nearly poking a hole in the radio re-
ceiver, listening to a broadcast of “Trea-
sure Island.” Israel Hands was chasing
Jim Hawkins up the mast with a large
knife between his teeth ; the good ship
Hispaniola had just run aground ; Jim
Hawkins had discovered to his horror
that the priming of his pistol had been
damaged by the sea air, and, in short, a
pleasant time was being had by all. All,
that is, save our Uncle Henry. “Why,”
he demanded of me fiercely, “do you
let that boy frowst in here listening to
that balderdash when he ought to be
doing something?”
Charles, who has no awe of Uncle
Henry, indicated pantomimically that he
was doing something—chewing a large
apple. Uncle Henry snorted. “At your
age,” he said, addressing the apple-
masticator, “I had mastered the differ-
ential and integral calculus, could enume-
rate all the bones in the human body,
and was a proficient performer on both
the flageolet and the zither harp. I
couldn’t have done all that by sitting
listening to blah out of a box.” “Nay,
nay, Henry,” I murmured pacifically,
drawing him away from the scene which
he seemed to so strongly dislike, “but
surely you read Stevenson when you were
a kid?” “Of course I did,” snapped
Uncle, with the avidity which I knew by
long, sad experience indicates that I have
supplied just the fuel needed for his in-
ternal fires. “That’s the point! I read
‘Treasure Island’ and ‘Kidnapped’ and
‘The Master of Ballantrae’ and all the
rest of them ; either bought ’em out of
small savings, got ’em as prizes for hard
work at school, or tramped two miles
and back to the town library for them.
So did you, except that I don’t remember
you ever winning any prizes. Point is,
we had to put up some sort of effort
before we could go sailing with Jim Haw-
kins or prowling the heather with David
Balfour. The modern boy has things
made too soft for him, and of all the
sappy influences those blasted broad-
casting contraptions are the worst. They
and the moving pictures. They kill
imagination. You and I, though wc
don’t realise it now—at least you don’t
—had to fill in quite a lot of outlines for
ourselves when we digested ‘Westward
Ho’ or ‘Tom Cringle’s Log.’ Illustra-
tions were scanty, and we had to make
our own Spanish Main and our own
coral islands. Now the nippers see all
that sort of thing on the screen twice a
week and just sit there stolidly chewing
lollies and resting their blank minds.”
“If they didn’t sit quietly they’d get
chucked out,” I observed, I think reason-
ably, but Uncle disregarded the inter-
ruption. “Here we live,” he raved on.
“in an age when every year there are
unfolded more new inventions and de-
lights than happened in a thousand years
before this century ; when revolutionary
political changes are going on all around
us and history is being made at an as-
tounding pace ; when the wildest dreams
of yesterday are the achievements of to-
day and the commonplaces of to-morrow,
and the modern kid, among it all, has
lost curiosity and the capacity for
wonder ; has no perspective ; is so used
to having vast feasts of amusement served
up on plates and covered with sweet
syrup that he regards all work as drud-
gery. He is blase ; he suffers from mental
indigestion.” Uncle Henry paused to
inhale sufficient breath to continue.
“Henry,” 1 said firmly, “I’ll tell you
what you are. You are a fogey —an
old fogey. It runs in the family. I re-
member dad telling us that his dad
reckoned the world had gone to pot be-
cause the family wanted to drop agricul-
tural production for one day and see the
first sod turned of the railway from
Wantabilli to Mannidingo. Granddad
reckoned all this progress was sent by
Satan to give folk excuses for idleness.
Whatever else may happen to the kids
of this generation they’ll at least never
be afraid of new ideas, and as to imagi-
nation —think of their horizon and think
of ours at their age!”
“There you go!” exploded Uncle fret-
fully. “You get abusive, you call me an
old fogey, and you drag in grandfather
Wigley—dam’ old fool—all to bolster up
an utterly wrong notion that because
something is new it must be good. D’ye
know what I think—l think the world
has been through all this fandango a
thousand times before, and the reason
you don’t find traces of those other so-
called ‘civilisations’ is that when they got
sufficiently sophisticated they destroyed
themselves and all their works with scien-
tific completeness. That’s the end of it
all—boredom! By the way, Charles
ought to have finished his serial by now.
What about tuning in and seeing how
the air race is going?”
SIMPLICITAS.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
Unfortunately severe static abounde
on all bands right down to 20 metres a
the start of the centenary air race. 1 nis
static was world-wide, a Japanese arnateui
being heard informing an American o.
its severity on code in the 20-metre band.
Apparently what was surmised when
PHI first returned to the 25-metre band
is correct. The station has been taken
over by some other concern, and is no
longer operated by Philips. It is now
operating on a dual wave: 25.57 an
about 19.7 metres. The station which
has been heard between FYA and DJB
in the 19-metre band came up to good
strength on a recent Sunday, and was
found to be transmitting the same pro-
gramme as PHI.
The station on 31.4 at night turns out
to be one of the D.E.I. group. The call
was signed in code before opening one
night, a very helpful feature when foreign
languages are used. GSC is now being
used on No. 2 and 3 transmissions. This
is even stronger than GSB, but conges-
tion in that part of the 31-metre band
is severe. It takes a good receiver to
prevent interference on any night when
2ME, GSC, VUB and DJA are together
and signalling powerfully.
RNE has been giving first-class music
after midnight at great strength. FYA
(19.6) broadcast an account of Poincares
funeral on the 20th ult., an impressive
transmission.
The air race was followed from vari-
ous stations of the 8.8. C., and as far as
the first two days were concerned the
news was generally hours ahead of news
broadcast in Australia. In spite of severe
static, the comment on the start was
copied 80 per cent., although the attempt
to rebroadcast this here was hopeless.
This emphasises the value of the short
waves ‘, none of the broadcast-band sta-
tions could be copied except in patches
here because of static and fading, the
latter being excessive.
The Japanese on 44 metres, a new
transmission, has been at excellent
strength. The English news session
about 8 p.m. has been given in
perfect English, and the music is much
more interesting than it used to be, less
Oriental music being used.
The 8.8. C. No. 1 transmission still
drops strength sharply after 6.30 p.m.,
with GSB best, but static has been really
heavy for these wave-lengths, making any
but very strong signals quite impossible
to copy.
A very decided improvement has been
noted on 19 metres at night, and four
stations after 10.30 are now quite good
—FYA (19.68), DJB (19.73), GSF (19.82)
and apparently what is PHI, on about
19.7 metres.
NIGHTOWL.
Amateur Chatter.
The receiver is always a point for
controversy among amateurs, and all
have their own pet versions of the humble
regen.-det.-cwm-audio. Superhets abound
in many shacks, and, as for the opinions
surrounding these, they vary from
plaudits to curses. A well-made ama-
teur superhet can be a thing of joy, but
the other kind can be just a box of noise
and indifferent signals.
The main trouble with many superhets
intended for amateur work is superfluous
valves. These are invariably arranged to

TORCHES. REFILLS (r RADIO BATTERIES
give more than enough I.F. amplifica-
tion, with consequent raising of noise
generally. The thing to do is to cut down
on the I.F. valves and use controllable
regeneration. It can be done very suc-
cessfully, as in the Regenerative Reflex
superhet to be described. This receiver
is an all-wave model with plug-in coils
for broadcast and short-wave listening,
but the fitting of bandspread is easy
enough for amateur work. The method
of obtaining regeneration is unique. The
687 (or 287) is I.F. amplifier, second de-
tector and audio in one, with regenera-
tion on the diode portion. Sufficient re-
generation is provided to hold oscilla-
tion just in check, but by the use of an
extra-small switchable capacity oscil-
lation can be permitted for C.W. beat
reception. Considering that three valves
only are necessary for this superhet,
although driver and Class B are shown
for speaker work on battery operation,
this seems to be the commencement of a
new era in short-wave (or broadcast)
superhets.
The world-spanning England-Australia
air race has provided breathless interest
for amateurs in following the doings on
the commercial channels for aviation
communication. Most interesting was
the period when the K.L.M. Douglas
machine was trying to locate itself on
the border of N.S.W. on a murky night,
with the air rent by static. The ’plane’s
radio man could be heard trying to raise
control points for bearings after the big
machine had had compasses and instru-
ments thrown off accuracy by an electri-
cal storm, and PK (Dutch East Indies)
amateurs could be heard seeking informa-
tion on 7mc. from VK’s. When Parmen-
tier had put the Douglas down almost on
a threepenny bit at Albury without inci-
dent, the impulse was for three cheers
for this superb pilot and his crew. One
wondered, at the time, if the announce-
ments of the 2CO transmitter as “3AR
Melbourne” may not have given the
operator on the ’plane the impression
that Albury was a suburb of Melbourne!
Roscoe Turner had an experience of
being put down safely at Allahabad due
to first-class R.A.F. radio work, and
altogether radio has played a most im-
portant part in the race. It must have
helped to spur Scott and Black on when
they learned at Darwin that the K.L.M.
machine was hot on their trail.
Contestants in the centenary amateur
test must have had a bad time during
the air-race week-end, for static was per-
fectly maddening; but many stalwarts
were heard carrying on on 7mc., notably
VK3EG, seemingly unruffled by adverse
conditions.

Radio Personalia.
The name of Arnplion, famous in loud-
speakers, is so closely associated with
the name of Pat Manley that, in the
CAPT. P. MANLEY, M. Inst. R.E.
Australian radio trade, the two are con-
sidered as one. Captain P. J. Manley,
M. Inst. R.E., managing director of
Arnplion (A’sia) Ltd., knows quite a lot
about radio, and what he doesn’t know
about loudspeakers would stand on a
pin’s head. He was born in Melbourne
in 1894, joined Victorian Railways Tele-
graph and ’Phone Division in 1910, and
served with the 26th Signal Engineers,
C.M.F., from 1912-14. Passing through
Duntroon he was commissioned in the
A.I.F. in 1915, and served in Egypt,
France and Belgium with rank of
Captain, commanding “Signals” Ist
Div. Artillery. In 1920 he was: in
the reserve of officers, and in 1931
he was transferred to the Australian
Corps of Signals, then attached Ist Cav-
alry Division. In 1921 he was en-
gaged commercially with Amalgamated
Wireless, and joined Arnplion (A’sia) in
1927 as managing director. In 1930
Speakers (A’sia) Ltd. was formed, with
Manley as managing director, the name
of this company later reverting to Am-
plion (A’sia) Ltd. Captain Manley has
studied radio manufacturing and mer-
chandising methods in America on sev-
eral occasions. He is a member of the
Institute of Radio Engineers, Councillor
of the United Service (Army, Navy and
Air Force Institution), member of the Im-
perial Service and Legacy clubs, finds
recreation in fishing and swimming, and
in his few spare moments resides at
Altona, Vaucluse.
The Q. and A. Column.
(!) Would it be possible to use A 415 and
A 409 valves respectively with the portable
signal generator (B. 12/9/’34)? (2) Will an
A.WA. 34-/61-1 audio transformer be suitable ?
—162.
(1) These valves will be suitable with a 4-volt
filament supply. (2) Yes. The value of the
tuning condenser is .0005 mfd.
I am using an Airzone portable battery re-
ceiver with a combination of Philips 4-volt
valves, mostly A4o9’s and 415’s. Changing
valves and using 8406’s or A42s’s doesn’t seem
to make much difference. Performance is fair,
but I should like to increase volume and selec-
tivity. What valve combination do you recom-
mend ? —165.
Apparently this is one of a very old type of
receiver based on a neutrodyne circuit. Not
much improvement can be effected by valve
changing. The better plan is to remodel the
set on more modern lines or have it done by
a reliable radio man. A portable made up in
a T.R.F. circuit using the new 2-volt valves,
Westector and Class-B audio, with midget con-
denser gang, coils, and midget permagnetic
speaker, can give really good results. It is
intended to describe such a receiver in due
course.
Name of a reference book containing suffi-
cient information to enable one to sit for the
Amateur Operator’s Certificate of Proficiency,
and where can I obtain particulars of the know-
ledge required for the examination ? —166.
The “Radio Amateur’s Handbook,” from
Swain’s, Pitt-street, Sydney; 6s. 6d. The
A.O.P. certificate indicates that the holder has
(<r) an elementary knowledge of the working
and adjustment of low-powered apparatus, and
(A) a knowledge of the principal abbreviations
and regulations laid down by the International
Radio Telegraph Convention, and that he has
passed in Morse transmission and reception by
ear at a speed of not fewer than 12 words per
minute (five letters being counted as one word).
Further information from Radio Inspector,
Post Office, Perth.
(1) Would the AC2 Am pi ion speaker be suit-
able for use with the Wide-World Four re-
ceiver? (2) Are ready-made coils obtainable
for the receiver ? If so, where ? (3) A pproxi-
mate weekly upkeep for batteries for the Wide-
World Four ? —167.
(1) Only if fitted with transformer to suit the
Class-B valve. (2) Try Standardised Products,
14 Hedger-avenue, Ashfield (N.S.W.). (3) De-
pends upon the number of hours the set is
in use. Approximately Is. Bd.
(I) Would an old Radiokes screen-grid short-
wave coil kit, with the primary removed, be
suitable for use in an electron-coupled circuit ?
(2) Is the type 15 a successful detector under
all conditions of short-wave tuning? —l69.
(1) It is a matter for trial with the coil
kit. Experiment may be necessary with the
reaction coil, which will take the place of the
cathode coil. There is no reason why good
results should not be obtained. (2) The Type-
-15 valve has proved very successful in all
short-wave applications tried by this paper, and
is strongly recommended.

SYDNEY SUFFERER
PRAISES THIS
FAMOUS REMEDY
We publish this letter because it is so
obviously genuine, even without name ;
a convincing picture of gratitude for
the sure effect of this new-principle
remedy—De Witt’s Antacid Powder.
13th June, 1934. Mosman, Sydney, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,
What users say of De Witt s Antacid
Powder is correct in every particular—l can
confirm it If any person has suffered more
intensely than I from inflamed, painful, dis-
tended stomach acid eructations (gras) and
from all those discomforting and heart-
breaking- signs of a thoroughly disturbed
digestion, then I feel profoundly sorry for
that person. I bought vour Powder because,
for one reason, I had already bought every-
thing else and, for another reason, because
the ingredients named on the canister appeared
to offer something different—something with
possibilities of affording relief. They did, very
promptly, too, and that relief has been
sustained. To-day I am well—really well;
full of the joy of life and for the first time in
years hungry for my meals! I now take
De Witt’s Antacid Powder only after the
principle meal. Your preparation has not let
me down, and I do think I should register
public testimony of the virtue of at least one
proprietary medicine that can fill its claims
in full.
(Sigmed) Mr.
De Witt’s Antacid Powder, with its
perfectly balanced formula of proven
ingredients to relieve stomach troubles,
is now bringing peace and happiness to
thousands of one-time sufferers in all
parts of the world.
De Witt’s Antacid Powder neutralises
excess acidity, protects the inflamed
stomach linings from the hot, burning
acids, and actually digests a portion
of your food.
Gone for ever are those awful pains
caused by indigestion, flatulence, dys-
pepsia, gastritis, ulcerated stomach.
No more days spent in agony and
dreadful restless nights.
Why endure the pain and danger of
digestive troubles a day longer ? You
can get immediate relief and finally
rid yourself of your trouble entirely.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Theo goes on the scroll of fame as
winner of the A.J.C. and Vic. Derbies,
but his success at Flemington was less
meritorious than the one at Randwick.
In the Victoria Derby he squeezed home
by a half-head, after a memorable
duel over the last two furlongs with
Sylvandale, a stable-mate. Before the
race Fred Williams, the trainer, was
dubious as to whether Theo could
account for Farndale, whose Caulfield
Cup form had impressed him greatly.
Fred made no mention of Sylvandale,
and there is no doubt that he was
astounded at the fight which that colt
put up. After dismounting McCarten,
rider of Theo, said “The race wasn’t run
to suit him, and that accounted for the
close finish.”
It was a slow Derby race. Turning
out of the straight, Badger attempted
to steady the pacemaker, Spearflash;
this caused the field to pack up for a
few strides. Farndale resented being
squeezed, and dropped the bit. For the
remainder of the journey he refused to
gallop in earnest.
No real acceleration of speed occurred
until the mile post was reached. Theo
Bert; ”I ve got tem on
THE FAVORITE "

BACK AGAIN ? vv
had moved up behind Spearflash, Sylvan-
dale and Hyperion. It would have
suited McCarten for his mount to be
much farther back in a fast-run race.
Still the backers of Theo reckoned that
everything was merry and bright when
the favorite commenced to run up to
Spearflash and Sylvandale at the straight
entrance. Spearflash soon compounded,
and although HypCrion was still in
the picture, it looked to be merely
a question of Theo dashing past Fred
Williams’s other candidate to score as
he had scored in the Caulfield Guineas.
However, Sylvandale not only fought on
gamely but threatened to upset the
punters’ applecart. Gameness pulled
Theo through. First one colt and then the
other had his nose in front; Theo
obtained the last kick, and a mighty
throng sighed with relief when they saw
No. 7 hoisted above the judge’s box.
Hyperion was third ; time 2min. 35|sec.;
11 to 8 on Theo ; 15 to 1 Sylvandale ;
33 to 1 Hyperion.
It was a day of splendid sport. The
Melbourne Stakes, which preceded the
Derby, . provided a wonderful finish.
Peter Pan —as in Sydney—had alarmed
his Cup supporters by showing lameness
after galloping on the tracks. Frank
McGrath issued reassuring statements
to the newspapers and made no secret
of his belief that Peter would win the
Cup. So handsome and well-conditioned
did the son of Pantheon appear when
he reached the course that public money
was piled on him, and Peter Pan ousted
Chatham from favoritism. A. E. Blair,
owner of Chatham, attributed the Caul-
field Stakes downfall of his horse to the
son of Windbag being short of a gallop.
Davidson, for his part, had reported that
Chatham jumped all the crossings at Caul-
field, as y/ell as the shadow of a tree.
“In fact,” Davidson told his employer,
“he did everything but gallop.”
No excuse could be offered for
Chatham in the Melbourne Stakes. He
set the pace, as was only to be expected.
Nothing troubled him until the straight
was entered. With 211 b. more than his
Cup impost, Sir Simper had led the pur-
suit up to that point, where he tired and
was eased up. Peter Pan closed on
Chatham in much the same fashion that
Theo did on Sylvandale in the succeed-
ing event, but with a vastly different
result. Davidson had Chatham flat out
at the furlong post. Momentarily he
promised to stall off Peter Pan, but the
chestnut fought on with lion-hearted
courage. All was over immediately he
drew level with the leader. Chatham had
to acknowledge defeat, and knocked up
so much in the last few strides that he
missed a place. Hall Mark put up a
phenomenal performance in beating
Nightly by a head for second place.
The only turn-up for McShortodds
was the Maribyrnong Plate triumph of
Bimilla, but it ought to have insured
him against loss on the remainder of the
racing. Bimilla started at 33 to 1 and
paid more than 64 to 1 on the tote —
a striking example of how the book-
makers benefit when an outsider scores.
Bimilla was bred by L. and R. Payten
at their Canowindra stud, and is by
Excitement, a Hurry On stallion im-
ported as a yearling by P. H. Osborne in
1928 ; the dam, Coucal, is by Magpie
from Fadelma, a mare that raced in
Victoria. Celerity, the dam of Fadelma,
won the Oakleigh Plate of 1910 for
E. A. Connolly. The Excitement year-
lings offered in Sydney last Easter were
a good-looking lot, and Bradfield, the
veteran Flemington trainer, gave 300gns.
for Bimilla on behalf of F. S. Austin,
a Riverina pastoralist. The filly is
trained by Bradfield’s son, perhaps the
youngest holder of a license in the
Commonwealth.
Bimilla came right away at the half-
distanCe and scored by \\ lengths from
Golden Promise, with Strathardle, an-
other Sydney winner, third. Gay Lover,
who was a slightly better favorite than
Theresa Gamba, ran fourth. Theresa
Gamba faded out after holding a com-
manding lead on the lawn rails.
Arachne (11 to 8), the fastest filly of
her age in Australia, ran away with the
Wakeful Stakes, and L’Elite (8 to 1)
registered an all-the-way win in the Can-
tala Stakes. Three Sydney horses, Aus-
tralia Fair, Closing Time and Dermid
(badly away as usual), followed L’Elite
home.
In the Hotham Handicap a sensation
was created by Trey ford (100 to 1) lead-
ing until a few strides from home ; then
the Westralian horse Panto (11 to 2)
obtained the mastery and scored by less
than a length. Treyford, though a
brother to Trivalve, the Derby and Cup
winner of 1927, was at forlorn odds be-
cause of being a maiden performer at
four years. His div. (for 55.) was
£7 17s. 6d. .
Melbourne Stakes form left no doubt
in the > minds of spectators that Peter
Pan is the champion galloper of the
Commonwealth, and he at once came into
renewed favor for the Cup, joining Sir
Simper at the head of the quotes. Hall
Mark firmed considerably, but Theo lost
a degree of popularity. Marabou’s fourth
in the Derby caused him to be regarded
as having at least as good a Cup chance
as his stablemate Farndale.
If Peter Pan (9st. 71b.), Hall Mark
(9st. 61b.) and Nightly (9st. 61b.) have
come through the Melbourne Cup
race all right they should take part in a
great tussle in the Duke of Gloucester
Cup on Saturday. Peter may win;
Panto (7s. 81b.) is a good lightweight.
* * * *
Trebles to jockeys Keith Cook and
Stan Jones were features of the racing
at Canterbury Park, where the attend-
ance was affected by showery weather.
Well-backed horses were successful in
six of the eight events.
Wallace Mimi (7 to 2, and fours were
laid) captured the Canterbury Handicap
because Cook wisely stuck to the rails.
Seizing an opening at the half-mile,
he dashed the gelding through at that
point, and it was all over. Winrose and
Lavington, second and third, will be all
the better for the run. The favorite,
Broccoli, hurdled off at the start, went to
the front and tried to make his own
pace, but he was in a sour mood. He
had had enough a long way from home.
■ Questionnaire (2 to 1) was a lucky
winner of the Flying Handicap ; Gay-
hawk, second, tried to run off at the
turn. Varnottar, third came home well,
but Cuban Song and Dunerc disap-
pointed ; Cuban Song, nevertheless,
showed plenty of pace, and should do
better at mid-week fixtures.
Having his first run, Old Oak, a smart
type of gelding by Tom Pinch’s sire
The Wooden Horse from a Beau Soult
mare, Halbeau, won the first division of
the Two-year-Old at 20 to 1. The second
heat went to Joy (evens), who carries
the colors of a Barraba pastoralist, H. W.
Capel. She led throughout; the Rosehill-
trained Gentility would have extended
her but for lugging out and finishing
under the judge’s box.
Narbethong (8 to 1), ridden by the
hurdle jockey Hood, struggled home in
the first heat of the Highweight. The
hot favorite Emily Rose, after losing
ground at the start, went wide on the
turn and just failed to reach Narbethong
and Charalf. The second division went
to the consistent Raleigh (4 to 1). He
drew the rails and was not in danger
of defeat over the last half-mile;
Cinema and Earlminster chased him to
the judge. Baltimore, who was the
medium of a plunge, could not go the
pace early; he will do better over a
longer journey than six furlongs.
Fernclove (5 to 2) made hacks of the
opposition in the Ashbury Handicap.
The way was made easier when the favo-
rite Havilah Belle fell, but at the time
Fernclove was in front and pulling
double. Moallin and Leone filled the
places.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
A greatly increased crowd saw Son-
nenberg and Meyers put up a fine show
at Sydney Stadium. Sonnenberg was
faster than his foe, but in the third
Meyers got a toehold on the leg Sonnen-
berg was said to have “broken” in Mel-
bourne and scored a fall. With flying-
tackles and a body-press Sonnenberg
got even in the fifth. He missed with
another tackle in the sixth, and, shoot-
ing through the ropes, hit a press-seat
with his head, being knocked out. At
Leichhardt Lurich lost to Haban Singh
on a'foul.
The Watermen
Rowing the Fairbairn style to perfec-
tion, the London R.C. made hacks of
the opposition in heats and final in the
race for the Henley-on-Yarra Grand
Challenge Cup in Melbourne on Satur-
day. Its opponent in the final was
the Wanganui (M.L.) eight, which had
also won its heats easily, and a tough
race was expected. The English crew
paddled home by four lengths. Time
was 4min. 37sec. for the mile, a record.
Notable, too, was the feat of Nepean,
the only country club in N.S.W. Refused
a share of the Henley-on-Yarra subsidy
by Ma, the club sent down a four on
its own and scooped the maiden fours
as well as landing second place in the
championship sculls with Tipping. First
place, of course, was filled by title-holder
Turner (N.S.W.), who covered the mile
in smin. 28sec.
* * * *
“Caux”: The London R.C. is said to
be the first English crew to row in Aus-
tralia. Years ago, a combination of
Oxford and Cambridge blues met the
famous Footscray eight (“The Mud-
punchers”) on the Yarra and suffered
defeat by many lengths. The “Mud-
punchers” were so nicknamed because
most of them were employed by Mel-
bourne Harbor Trust —wheeling barrow-
loads of mud was their daily occupation.
After winning the Sir William Clarke
Challenge Cup three times in succession,
Footscray fell in with a proposal to send
them to England. The money was raised,
but no English crew would compete
against them under the rule banning
manual workers from amateur rowing.
That rule was rescinded some years ago.
* * * *
“Catch”: The appearance of the All-
Black oarsmen at the Sydney regatta
on the Parramatta, on November 10
seems to have roused the ambitions
of every rowing addict in Sydney.
Haberfield, Mosman, Police and Syd-
ney are ready to give them a go in
the eights—University, which appeared
at Henley-on-Yarra, did not enter —while
no fewer than 12 scullers are to try to
lower the colors of Smith and Abbott
in th£ 2000-metres sculls. This will mean
rowing the event in heats, the first time
in its history.
* * * *
“Blade”: The- N.S.W.R.A. has con-
trol of the inter-State eight-oar race for
the King’s Cup in 1935, and has fixed
May 11 on the Nepean for the clash.
The course is the best in Australia, three
miles straight with a slight bend just at
the start and high banks on both side:,
to shelter the crews from wind. The
Australian championship sculls will be
decided the same day, the holder, police
man H. Turner, defending his title.
Ins and Outs
“Amateur Pro.”: The Bulletin has
always refused to accept the bland assur-
ance of the State and Australian cricket
authorities that their players are not pro-
fessionals, although they accept sums
varying from £5O in an ordinary season
to many hundreds for an Australian
Eleven trip. In every other country in
the world our men are professionals, as
one of them desiring to enter for an
Olympic event would dashed soon find
out. N. S. Wales, at any rate, is showing
signs of a change of heart. At a recent
meeting several speakers made pointed
reference to professionalism increasing
in competitive cricket. One, at least,
said there was no fault with professional-
ism • “when it was honest and above-
board, but we should not encourage it
in an underhand form.” Other delegates
very rightly seemed to be of the same
opinion, so there may be something doing
one of these days.

Three Year Old: Misnomer ; next

“Eagle Farm”: There are plenty of
backers in Queensland for a system of
licensed s.p. shops. F. A. Cooper has
drawn up an elaborate scheme for
Cabinet’s consideration. His idea is the
issue of 2500 general bookmakers’
licenses scattered about the State, fees
charged to be according to the area the
s.p. men operate in. These fees are esti-
mated at £500,000 a year, and, in addition,
the 2500 bookies, using an average of 400
tickets per week, with a penny tax on each
ticket, would bring in £200,000 more in
yearly revenue, the estimate being that
50,000,000 tickets would be issued annu-
ally. With £750,000 in hand the Govern-
ment could dish out a third to the clubs.
The Langsters talked like that when they
brought in their 10 p.c. tax on backers
of winners.
* * * *
“Durdans”: The Cambridgeshire Stakes,
last of the big betting handicaps of the
English flat-racing season, was run over
a mile and a quarter at Newmarket last
week and won by Wychwood Abbott,
a colt by Black Abbott out of Sweet
Hainault. Thirty-three started, and the
winner’s price was 9’s. Outside the actual
running, the race was responsible for a
remarkable coup. One of London’s big-
gest s.p. men —they call them commission
agents over there, —bought the Irish
sweep tickets of all the starters his agents
could pick up in New York, where the
lottery has a great vogue. For 60
tickets he paid £60,000 ; the rake-in
was £400,000. Two Australians were in
the race —Togo Johnstone, on Renten
Mark, and Sibbritt, on Spirituelle 11.
Neither was placed.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Hamilton”: The hurried visit of the
English amateurs to Brisbane was respon-
sible for some good golf at Yeerongpilly
links, though in the end the tourists won
all the singles but one between Bourn
and Neil, which was squared. Radcliffe
and Boyce had a meritorious win in the
foursomes from Scott and Garnett by
3 and 2, but McLean, who played great
golf throughout, downed Neil and Gill,
1 up, with Bourn to help as offsider.
*** " $
“Divot Digger”: Australia’s first pro-
fessional international golf match kicks
off on Friday on the Lakes course, owned
by the Sydney club whose liberality made
possible the presence in Australia of the
American team which landed in Sydney
on Monday. Our team, now that Kelly
has preferred the fleshpo'ts of Melbourne,
is Bolger, Cohen, Sam Richardson, Don
Spence (N.S.W.), with Naismith (Vic.)
and Rufus Stewart, of South Australia.
* * * *
“Wanderjahr”: In spite of “Far Hills’s”
pessimism (B. 24/10/’34), it may be that
Will Bolger will seek his golf fortune
overseas, beginning with America. Sara-
zen has put £5O in the hat to provide
funds for the winner of the Australian
open and Spence. Others are following
suit, and at time of writing the cady held
over £4OO, with more coming. Some of
the subscribers think that Kelly, winner
of the open title last year and of the pro-
fessional crown at this last meeting,
should be Bolger’s partner. That will
have to be settled later.
* * t- *
“Carnoustie”: Some of the statements
in Sarazen’s articles on golf in Sydney
“Herald” have roused the wrath of
local addicts, who particularly object to
his nonchalant acceptance of barracking
one’s opponent to put him off his game.
Sarazen refers to Hagen as the cham-
pion in this respect. The American
killed his reputation as a sportsman in
England when playing Abe Mitchell in
a match extending over two days. Mit-
chell was well in the lead on the first
day; Hagen turned up an hour late
on the second, and by the time play had
started the temperamental Englishman
was useless for golf purposes. A com-
mittee worth its salt would have disquali-
fied Hagen and given Mitchell the match.
Play was permitted, and Hagen won a
substantial side-wager.
* * * *
Australia’s amateur golf team for the
second Test against England at Mel-
bourne at the week-end is the same as
the first, which was easily beaten in
Sydney, save that left-hander Williams,
of Victoria, replaces Cornstalk Apperly.
Williams was selected for the first team,
but could not get away to Sydney. He
will greatly strengthen our singles
game, but the Englishmen have proved
themselves such formidable combina-
tions in the foursomes matches that our
chances do not look bright. Royal
Melbourne is the convincing ground.
* * * *
“Oaklands”: The annual Victorian
A.I.F. golf tourney drew the record entry
of 560 to the Eastern Club. This was
the seventh occasion of the meet, and
putting the huge crowd through was a
bigger nightmare than ever. The weather
was beastly, but winner J. R. Cozens,
off the 7 mark, played fine golf for a
card of 80. The limbless contingent
played over nine holes as their share, and
here T. N. McLennan won off 8 with
a net score of 47.
* * * *
“Dutch”: Your auctioneer does not
miss much. One was selling some land
on the edge of a Sydney golf course the
other day while some players were pass-
ing within a few yards. Suddenly one
of the gowfers chipped in. The man with
the hammer picked him up smartly:
“The last bid was £3 10s.; did I hear you
bid four, sir?” “You did not,” answered
TWO GOLFING STARS.
Sarazen Kirkwood.
the player emphatically, settling himself
for his shot; “I was calling ‘fore’ to
those slow-motion players in front.”
* * * >i=
“Lakeside”: The American golf ad-
vance agents are talking biggity about
the performances of their professional
team which will soon be with us. One
Thompson, not an official member of the
side, is said by Sarazen to be the longest
driver living, though he only uses a
13ioz. driver, which means that his
swing could give the average circular-saw
a start. All the same, like most big-
hitters, he does not seem to be in the
first-class. In Hattersley, of N.S.W., we
have a distance-smiter of renown. What
about a match between him and the
Yank?
Ins ancf Outs
“Cottesloe”: When the Australian
Eleven, "less Bradman, blew into West-
«alia„ Woodfull was presented with an
“urn” made of jarrah—object not stated.
A good silver pot holding at least a
quart would have been the writer’s pick
had he been given the choice. However,
Woodfull is reputed to be a teetotaller,
so a wooden one would do him as well
as anything.
* * * *
“Gabba”: Queensland cricketers are
jubilant to hear that South African
Christy will land in Brisbane in plenty
of time to taka part in his first Sheffield
match. He is due in Sydney on Novem-
ber 14, and will have over a fortnight
for practice. The rule requiring three
months’ residence in the State has been
waived as a special dispensation. One
hopes he will do Queensland cricket
some good. Still, his coming is a return
to the bad old policy which ruined the
game there years ago—that of bringing
cricketers from other places and ignor-
ing local players. Even now a consider-
able percentage of the State team com-
prises importations from N.S.W.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip’’: Stan McCabe will not
play in the opening Sheffield in Sydney
against South Australia, beginning Nov.
23. Stan has quite recovered from his
’board-ship accident, but intends, after
the Woodfull-Ponsford benefit in Mel-
bourne, to spend a few minutes at Gren-
fell—it will seem like that to his people.
As Bradman will be absent from the
S.A. side the expected gates will prob-
ably not materialise.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: That allotment of
payments to N.S.W. inter-State cricketers
did not go through without argument.
Treasurer Tyler bluntly said that present
payments made the recipients semi-pro-
fessionals at least—though there can be
no half measures with that kind of thing
—and chairman Oxlade gave vent to quite
unusual opinions. He thought that if a
boy couldn’t afford to leave his work to
play cricket he shouldn’t be encouraged
to put sport before his living, but that
his work should come first. This is
quite a revolutionary view.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Marylebone continues to
nibble at a solution of the “leg-theory
problem.” It is said to be considering
Mailey’s “diagonal-lines” scheme, which
would make a cricket pitch indistinguish-
able from a hopscotch court. But is
there any “leg-theory problem” now?
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: The Indian Cricket Con-
trol Board keeps pegging away at a visit
from an Australian team. The latest is
that that prince of Indian sportsmen Pati-
ala is trying to arrange for one to come
in 1934-35 and play 14 matches. The
Australian Board would certainly not
permit the trip. For one thing, an Aus-
tralian team goes to South Africa in
1935-36, and candidates for that will
have to be playing in the Australian
Sheffields during the time they are in-
vited to be in India.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”; The N.S.W. cricket heads
are only following the Sheffield rules in
ignoring the claims of Hunt to a place
in this season’s State Eleven (B.
31/10/’34). The Balmain bowler has only
just returned from playing professional
cricket in England, and the necessary
three months’ residence in Australia will
not be completed until January 22.
There are two matches left then, against
Victoria at Sydney, starting January 25,
and against Queensland at Brisbane,
beginning February 15.
* * * *
“Miaow”: The next “news” when the
Duke and the fliers have vanished from
the front pages promises to be the tour
of the English flapper cricketers. Inter-
viewed before leaving England, skipper
Betty Archdale, who is a barrister and
therefore better qualified than most to
argue with the umpire, told an inter-
viewer that her bowlers all affected the
overarm stuff and were mostly medium
fast, some of them turning the ball well.
The best bat, M. Maclagan, is “a Pons-
ford rather than a Bradman,” though
her picture shows her easier to look at
than the pair combined. Vice-capt. Snow-
ball is the ’keeper, and Miss Taylor the
Larwood. Their first match in Sydney is
against N.S.W., beginning December 14.
Several N.S.W. country centres will be
visited.
Racquet and Bawl
“Chic” : There was a flutter in Ameri-
can tennis circles last week when it was
announced that Frank Shields had signed
up for seven years with a big movie
combination. But it is explained that
Shields will not infringe his amateur
status, since he is not to be required to
appear in tennis pictures, even if the
youth’s tennis ability is the real draw
behind the scheme. There is a way out
for Perry here. Why not let him take on
a similar job? Instead of tennis he could
play ping-pong, that being a pursuit in
which he once excelled. He would still
draw the crowds without any special laws
having to be passed to protect his ama-
teur status.
“Lucre”: If things go on in American
tennis as at present, the Yanks will not
be able to field a Davis Cup team at all,
let alone the one they were preparing
to lick creation next year. George Lott,
the world’s best doubles player, has
gone over to the professionals and it is
considered that his regular partner,
Stoeffen, will follow. As Shields has
taken a picture-show job, which brings
him close to the hazy borderline dividing
amateur and pro., Uncle’s cake looks de-
cidedly doughy.
* * * He
“Top Spin”: Australia will see its
first international tennis match between
women players in Sydney on November
21 and 22. Two have been played in
England, however —in June, 1925, and
July, 1928. England won the first and
Australia the second. Misses Round,
Dearman and Lyle will be the English
representatives. Our own team is not
yet picked, but Joan Hartigan and Miss
Bickerton are certain starters.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: In spite of the
fact that Australia has not at present a
Davis Cup tennis team worth the cost of
sending overseas, a section of the Austra-
lian press is clamoring for another chal-
lenge. The closing date for entries is
January 31, and by that time Perry and
others may have quelled the enthusiasts.
In case they persist, I nominate Norman
Brookes, Gerald Patterson, Dr. McEl-
hone and Frank Peach as our team
for the challenge. Further, I will bet up
to a pound (Scots) that this combination
can lick any other we can produce in
Australia at the present moment.

“Volaille”: A pity no one sees fit to
revive the good old sport of chicken rac-
ing. In my. young days on a Barcoo
station with a noble fowlyard it was a
favorite sport on Sunday mornings if the
permission of the super.’s wife, always
boss of the chooks, was obtained. We
youngsters and the junior hands from
the hut —the Old Man, the over-
seer and visitors, including, prob-
ably, the inspector of police, would
be away in a patch of scrub in-
dulging in a main of cocks —got the
chickens. A little training soon polished
these up. Each man held his fancy on
a line, and on the signal flipped a pellet
of bread towards the finishing-line when
the barrier went up. The great art was
to flip the pellet right on to the line or
a few inches beyond it. Anything that
fell short meant paying out to the winner.

“James Pigg”: Describing a hare-hunt
at Ercildoune station in which the Duke
took part behind a “bobbery” pack, a
Sydney paper says this “introduced him
to a sport strange to English countrymen.”
In England the hare is hunted by more
packs of hounds than the fox. In addi-
tion to harriers—whose followers are
usually referred to by fox-hunters as
“currant-jelly boys”—there are countless
small packs of beagles and basset
hounds, both of which are followed on
foot. It’s safe to wager that the Duke,
at one time or another, has done his bit
pursuing the hare behind one collection
of tykes or another —the P. of W. used
to be a keen beagler.

Walter Dawson, dead at Creswick
(Vic.), was one of Victoria’s most
notable athletes. During a long resi-
dence at Ballarat he rowed in sev-
eral championship eights under the
famous Victorian stroke Jim Donald.
He was a sculler of note also, and
won the State title in 1894, while
he represented Ballarat at football and
cricket for years, playing against several
visiting English Elevens. One of Balla-
rat’s leading businessmen, he had only
recently returned from holidaying in
Britain.

“The Gaffer”: A Melbourne crowd has
arranged to bring to the centenary show
Ed Tolan, the American negro sprinter
and Olympic champion, now a profes-
sional, and one Macfarlane, who is said
to have done great things at Powderhal!
and elsewhere in Scotland where pro-
fessional running still lingers. Both will
be in Melbourne by Christmas, and will
come to Sydney later. The trouble will
be to find a man to stand up to the
pair. If they run up to their over-
seas times—in Tolan’s case world’s
records—Austin Robertson, of Victoria,
at present holder of the “world’s” cham-
pionship, will have no hope of living
with either, though he is suggested as our
representative. Handicap events will
probably fill most of the programme.
Here, with runners like T. Roberts, of
N.S.W., winner of the last Stawell Gift,
and one or two others, there should be
some interesting meetings.

“Splash”: After much backing and
filling it appears we are to have some
Japanese swimmers after all. The Ma
State heads have secured a visit from
Sakagama, free-style champion, and
Kiyokawa, Olympic champion and holder
of the world’s back-stroke record. The
pair reach Brisbane on December 11,
and stay there a week, coming to Syd-
ney for the N.S.W. championships, which
begin on January 5. Then they go on
to Melbourne, where they show in the
Australian championships on January 19
and 21. In February the N.S.W. crowd
hopes to land the French sprinter Taris
in the State, as well as Poussard the
diver and Chinese champion Chung
Hang, who is only 15. This trio will
show mostly in country centres.

Bond Issues Condemned
The Maoriland Companies Commission
in its final report condemns “land-utilisa-
tion” concerns —-otherwise bond cos.
Most of the weaknesses of the system
which the report dilates upon have been
pointed out in this paper from time to
time over the last six years.
“Between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000
has been invested in land-utilisation cos.
(including forestry cos.) during the past
10 or 12 years. Much of this capital has
already been lost to investors. The bulk
of the capital has been raised in New
Zealand and Australia, but an appre-
ciable sum has come from India, the
Far East and Great Britain.”
The report goes on to record the
opinion that bond finance is uneconomic
and wasteful. Those who provide the
greater part of the capital have little
share in the control. “Their security is
often unsatisfactory and may be whittled
away by abuses of which they are fre-
quently unaware until it is too late, and
against which there is Tittle redress. The
bond system provides abundant openings
for abuse, which appear to have attracted
many who are prepared to take full
advantage of them.”
The report supports The Bulletin’s
contention that the share capital put into
these concerns is often microscopic com-
pared with the bond-
money asked for,
and the promoter’s
profits unreasonably
high considering the
risks they take. Out
of 15 companies
paid capital was
£601,000 (£285,600
being for considera-
tion other than
cash), while the ag-
gregate bond-moneys
received amounted
to £5,265,591.
“Land utilisation
schemes are apt to
be ‘loaded’ and their
success imperilled by
excessive costs of pro-
motion and broker-
age, and by infla-
tion of the value of
land and other
assets.”
The Commission
recommended that
the issue of bonds be prohibited, and
suggested as an alternative the issue of
redeemable preference shares.
Bitter-sweet
Sugar is the most controversial food-
stuff in Australia. For many years up
to the onset of slump cane-sugar grow-
ing was a very profitable occupation in
many tropical parts of the world ; it was
aided by the growing consumption of
sweets and the fact that in countries suit-
able for cultivation there was ‘ generally
an abundance of cheap native labor.
Java, Mauritius and the West Indies be-
came the chief sugar plantations of the
world.
The northern rivers of N. S. Wales
and Queensland, largely under the obser-
vation of the C.S.R., started cultivation
fairly early. First recorded production
was in 1862. The Sugar Co. established
mills on the Clarence and Macleay in
1869, while plantations and mills were
started in Queensland in 1881 and in
Fiji the same year.
The industry in tropical Australia until
1906 was carried on with the help of
colored labor—mainly Kanakas. In the
year mentioned the final repatriation of
these aliens took place. “White-Austra-
lian” sugar has been produced from 1907
onwards. That year the average price
to the grower and miller was £lO 9s.
Id. a ton, and the minimum mill wages
74d. an hour. Taking these figures as
a base, the average return to the grower
and miller for the 1933 season, including
exported sugar, showed an increase of
54 p.c. over 1907, but wages had jumped
249 p.c. in the same period.
Government supervision of the grow-
ing and refining sections of the industry
dates back to 1915. Prices of locally-
consumed sugar are now fixed by ar-
rangement between the Queensland and
Commonwealth Governments, who em-
ploy the C.S.R. and Millaquin as refin-
ing and selling agents. The Sugar Board
is quite at liberty to erect its own re-
fineries if it thinks refining charges could
be reduced thereby.
When the sugar industry is criticised
the C.S.R. has to bear the brunt of the
attack. Nothing could be sillier. Taking
the disparity in wages into account, the
cost of refining in Australia is probably
as cheap as in any part of the world. The
C.S.R.’s margin of profit was mentioned
in these columns last week—it works
out at about a seventh of a penny a
pound.
The sugar embargo is no burden to
export industries. A rebate is allowed to
manufacturers on the sugar content of
goods exported, reducing the sugar cost
to world parity, which is at present lower
than it has ever been. From one of
the great moneymaking occupations
sugar-growing has fallen harder than
most others. In 1920 Australians could
buy sugar at 6d. a pound—cheaper than
anywhere else in the world. The present
price is 4d., which is above world parity,
but no more than butter or other regu-
lated primary products.
The bitterness which many people
seem to taste with the sugar in their
tea is largely the cost of peopling
and developing a part of tropical
Australia which so far has not shown
“If I won first prize in the lottery I’d buy a pub in some quiet spot’*
“But you wouldn’t get any customers.”
“’Oo’s talkin’ about customers?”
much adaptability for other profit-
able cultivation. There have been mis-
takes, particularly in the high prices paid
for sugar lands when politicians were
borrowing and spending freely. But in
this again sugar is not by itself.
What New Avenues?
Australia is self-supporting to a far
greater extent than it was 20 years ago.
Progress in steel and textile enterprises
has been remarkable. The B.H.P. es-
tablished itself during and after the war,
and has since developed into a gigantic
undertaking. Besides the requirements
of ordinary construction trades, special
steels and alloys are turned out at the
Newcastle works. Tinplate is now to
be manufactured. Lysaghts and Rylands,
of course, have been making galvanised-
iron, wire, nettings, etc., for years from
' B.H.P. products.
The woollen textile industry has grown
by leaps and bounds. It got a leg-up
during the war ; but during the import-
ing boom that followed it had keen
overseas competition to fight. Yarra
Falls and A.K.M. took the plunge about
1920 and largely extended their plant;
the first-named concern was interested in
spinning yarn, whereas most textile
mills had been hitherto concerned only
in weaving.
The A.K.M.-Yarra Falls enterprises
held their own right up to the time
slump hit us. Technically they made
great progress. Things were disorgan-
ised for a while when depression came ;
but, helped by tariff and exchange, the
whole Australian textile trade came in
for a bigger whack of the business offer-
ing. Kaysers, Holeproof and Morleys
established Australian factories; the
quality of many of these lines, and that
of the Australian firm of Prestige, would
be hard to beat by imported products.
Overseas cigarette people established
factories here. Kraft cheese, Goodyear
tyres, Cadbury’s chocolates —all are now
turned out in Australia. Electrical fit-
tings, too, as well as golf clubs, tennis
racquets and golf balls.
Murrumbidgee irrigation area now sup-
plies most of our rice requirements. The
Australian sugar and banana industries
are not regarded as unmixed blessings in
some quarters, and on the growing side
of those industries there has been from
time to time unhealthy speculation in
land ; but each provides a good deal of
employment. Our wines, where known
overseas, have a high reputation.
Tobacco-growing has been successful
only in spots, while cotton cultivation has
developed slowly despite a bounty. Lin-
seed is grown scarcely at all.
In some respects we have progressed
uncertainly. Amalgamated Zinc, after
establishing the big Electrolytic Zinc Co.
at Risdon, Tasmania —a great deal of
money was spent in research work, which
has made Australian spelter equal to
the world’s best—turned its attention to
paper-making in the Speck. At present
the only paper turned out in this coun-
try is kraft and similar lines, made from
rag, waste-paper and imported pulp.
Experiments showed that newsprint from
Australian hardwoods was a technical
possibility years ago ; it was later held
to be commercially practicable. But
until the last month or so no definite
step was made towards setting up a
paper-pulping mill in Australia. Recent
activities by Tasmanian Paper Pty.,
Paper Makers, Australian Paper Manu-
facturers and Melbourne “Herald” in-
terests are more encouraging.
There are other industries which are
bound to come with a growing popula-
tion. We are still largely dependent on
overseas for machinery and motor-cars.
Film-making, too, appears to have a
future if properly exploited.
Consols and Life Assurance
The terms of the proposed new
£15,000,000 loan will not be more favor-
able to the investor than 3 p.c. at 99,
which would show a yield of not more
than £3 Is. lOd. per cent., including re-
demption. The return will be the lowest
in the history of. the Commonwealth.
The point is approaching, if it has
not already been reached, where smaller
investors will pass by Commonwealth
securities as a paying investment.
The drop in the yield since 1929 has been
out of all proportion to the decline in
the cost of living. In that last pre-
depression year the average yield on
gilt-edged securities was between 5 p.c.
and 6 p.c. It is now around half that.
The Sydney index of wholesale prices,
which is fairly representative of the rest
of Australia, shows a reduction only from
186 to 150 over the same period.
Owing to their exemption from State
taxes Commonwealth loans are more
sought after by financial concerns, such
as banks and insurance cos., and well-to-
do investors. But even to life assurance
cos. this reduction in interest earnings
becomes an ever-increasing problem. In
1933, for instance, the National Mutual’s
net interest return was £3 19s. lid. per
cent., as against £5 6s. lid. per cent, in
1930. A judicious sprinkling of mort-
gages and industrial shares in its invest-
ment portfolio is necessary to make even
those returns possible at present.
But endowment assurance in a sound
office, with present bonus rates, is still
an excellent form of saving where the
assured is reasonably certain of being
able to continue premium payments
without borrowing on the policy before
maturity date. A sum of £lOO invested
in Consols now returning 3 p.c. would
take 33 years to show a return equal to
the capital sum invested. Though bonus
rates on a 33-year endowment would be
somewhere between 30s. and 40s. per
cent, during the first few years, that
rate accumulates at compound interest
on the full sum assured, even though
only a few premiums have been paid.
In a good office an endowment ought to
double itself by maturity date. Assum-
ing that a £lOO 33-year endowment
policy yielded a return of £2OO at
maturity, the effective interest return
would be much higher than that in the
case of the Commonwealth securities
mentioned. And the whole sum assured,
plus bonuses, might have become pay-
able through death after only a few
premiums had been paid.
There are not likely to be any bumper
wheat crops this year. A reliable Lon-
don authority, the “Grain, Seed and Oil
Reporter,” forecasts a decline in Euro-
pean countries of 498,528,000 bushels,
but this includes estimates for Russia and
China which are worth about as much
as the best information on the Melbourne
Cup. The N. and S. American decline
is prophesied at 76,832,000 bushels,
which is moderate considering the
severity of the western U.S.A. drought.
On the whole, it seems likely that there
will be less new wheat on the market
this season by from 350,000,000 to
500,000,000 bushels, but against this
there are 600,000,000 bushels of old
crop. Some of it is old enough to get a
pension. Australia will be very lucky if
she produces 145,000,000 bushels against
her 175,000,000 bushels in 1933 and
204,000,000 bushels in 1932. Rain, a
little drought, low prices and, in West-
ralia, rust, which is affecting northern
crops severely, are all taking their toll.

The late Sidney Myer gave £lO,OOO
towards beautifying the Yarra Boulevard,
which runs along the south side of Mel-
bourne’s waterway. The northern side
is still occupied by more or less slum
cottages dating from the ’fifties. Irish-
town, as the place used to be called, has
improved in morals but not in beauty,
and now the suggestion is to sweep away
the cottages and erect factories. : Some-
one has suggested an even better scheme
—to devote the central portion to fac-
tories and the frontages facing the river,
the parks and the main street to work-
ers’ flats.

“Shellback”: Australian timbers may
not be the “best in the world” (B.
10/10/ ’34), but they are of sufficiently
high quality to warrant both Africa and
America importing seed. These coun-
tries are cultivating that which, apart
from some recent departmental efforts,
we Australians have been doing our best
to destroy.
* * * *
“Billy Sec”: Why should typewriter
ribbons be such an extraordinary price
in this country? In Perth, for example,
these comparatively simple articles cost
4s. 6d. in all stationery shops. What’s
the reason?
* * * *
“M.G.”: Some of our public works
have justified themselves. Melbourne has
suffered the biggest October rainfall for 65
years, yet only a couple of low-lying sub-
urbs have suffered. Before the vast work
of Yarra improvement was completed in
the ’nineties, parts of Port Melbourne,
South Melbourne, Richmond and South
Yarra were under water every time there
was heavy rain, and the damage done
in three or four of these almost-annual
floods was as great as the whole cost of
the work. A glance at the photos, of old
Prince’s Bridge shows that the Yarra
there was only half the present width ;
while, instead of the gently-curved
stream of to-day, the river used to
wriggle like an eel. One of the lakes in
the Botanical Gardens was part of the
old river bed.

sented by a peasant girl and her swain.
The action takes place in a French vil-
lage at the time of Louis XV. Natasha
Bojkovich makes a graceful and color-
ful Lise, and Stanley Judson (who hails
from Sadlers Wells and the Old Vic.,
London) is an elegant and nimble-footed
.Luc. Paul Petroff, as an amorous mar-
quis, keeps the audience chuckling. “Les
Sylphides” (music by Chopin, choreo-
graphy by Fokine), though often done
by local amateurs, remains a favorite
with the womenfolk ; Olga Spessiva and
Anatole Vilzak are here the centres of
attraction. “Promenade: Old Vienna”
(music by Strauss and choreography by
Petroff), is a snappy piece in which Nat-
asha Bojkovich is an appealing coquette
and Paul Petroff an engaging dandy.

The State Symphony Orchestra, anew
organisation, gave its first concert at
Sydney Town Hall last week under the
baton of Con. Director Dr. Bainton. The
programme afforded a very comprehen-
sive test of the band’s capabilities, includ-
ing as it did a whole mob of old war-
horses —Beethoven’s Fifth, excerpts from
“Flying Dutchman,” “Lohengrin,”
“Tannhauser,” “Meistersingers” and
“Valkyries” and Tschaikowsky’s “Nut-
cracker” ballet music. It was a good
beginning; the orchestral voices all
under firm control and giving promise
that they eventually will form the per-
fectly responsive instrument every good
con<^uctor s '&hs for.
.
Melbourne passed a vote for a merrier
or more musical centenary Sabbath by
packing the Town Hall for the Celebra-
tions Council’s orchestral concert of
mainly Australian works. Fritz Hart’s
symphonic suite “The Bush,” conducted
by the composer, had the weirdness, the
elusiveness and the lack of definition of
Us namesake as encountered when even-
ing falls. If a literary analogy is per-
missible, it suggested the descriptions of
the bush in D. H. Lawrence’s “Kan-
garoo” ; while, musically, it was far
more like the Javanese gamelang than
Percy Grainger’s conscious attempt to
imitate that alien mode. It rose and fell
and ran away, and faded out, not accord-
ing to any previously-known plan, where-
as George English’s Symphony in D
Minor, which followed, had its feet firmly
planted on tradition and never strayed
from that familiar ground. Opening with
firmness and decision with a succession
of powerful hammer-strokes, it glided into
an expressive adagio. The allegro that
followed had vim, and a return to the
tempo of the first movement pro-
vided a second adagio with a plaintive
melody which was wavelike in the
violins, with foam upon it from the
brasses; it finished with what sounded
like a reminiscence from “Lohengrin.”
The grand finale was a gorgeous but well-
disciplined row. For some reason, the pro-
gramme-makers sandwiched in between
the two Australian works Rimsky Kor-
sakov’s symphonic suite “Scheherazade.”
* * *
“Jolly Roger,” the new musical comedy
at Melb. Princess on Saturday evening,
owed its great reception to the actors and
the presentation, not to the librettist. It
has a plot even more attenuated than
usual, and there is scarcely a line in the
whole play which would raise a smile
were it not for the manner in which it
is delivered. The thing purports to be a
satire on the old buccaneering days, but
it isn’t even that. It just ambles along,
but producer Claude Flemming and his
cast have done so well with the poor
material that the audience forgets its
poverty.
The success of the thing—for it was
a success —is due in a large measure
to the singing of Gladys Moncrieff;
but the real triumph is won by Jennie
Brenan and Margaret Berry and the hand-
picked and perfectly trained collection
of beautiful and shapely girls who con-
stitute the ballet.
There are three concerted ballets: the
Jamaican, introducing a variant of the
danse du ventre, is remarkable in its
artistic costuming and originality of
arrangement. The music is harmonious,
but there is only one number, “Love Is
Calling,” which will be heard whistled
about the streets. Wallace preserves the
continuity of the piece with his foolery,
Marshall Crosby, Byrl Walkley and
Phyllis Baker fill minor parts satis-
factorily and Claude Flemming gives a
heat sketch of the Governor. The
scenery of W. R. Coleman helped
the presentation considerably; the
audience, generally forgetful of such first-
aid to drama, was moved to applause.

“The Quern,” by Edith Sterling Levis
and C. H. Rolleston at the Sydney Savoy,
where it was played twice last week, was.
more a credit to local playwriting than
to local play production. It is based on
the legend of the introduction of the
mill-wheel into Ireland by King Cormac,
and, though wordy and smelling occa-
sionally of the “Playboy” school, is well
conceived. It is not, however, the meat-
of amateurs. With Gordon Craig doing
the settings, Edward German provid-
ing the music and Sybil Thorndike in
the leading role something might be made
of it, but in the hands of an amateur co.,
sometimes so low-voiced that the words
could not be heard half-way down me
hall, it was only a shadow of what it
might have been. Betty Considine. the
auburn-haired slave girl who marries the
king’s son, and Judith Halse Rogers
were passable female leads, but v the male
cast sounded as if it had been brought
up on Bell’s “Elocution.”

f
“Mai-Kopina,” an experienced New
Guinea native Administrator:
A recent Bulletin par. points out in a
few words what is required to save the
Australian native. The tragic attempts of
the past seem to have been to force into
an era of clothes and arithmetic people who
have not adopted the first essential of civilisa-
tion, e.g., agriculture. The spectacle of mis-
sionaries and politicians endeavoring to take
the rightful place of Administrators and police
in the Northern Territory suggests that the
administrative system there has failed. Surely
a solution could be found out of the ex-
perience of the magistrates of Papua, who have
the benefit of 50 years of training and study by
Hubert Murray and his predecessors. Such
men might establish centres of peace, and the
unfortunate blacks might be induced to settle
down and even adopt agriculture. Surely
there must be arable lands on the banks of
many of the northern Australian rivers that
would grow yams, taro and sugarcane?

“L. 1.8.”: A Brisbane i*adio announcer
has referred to Charleville (Q.) as “Woop
Woop.” In many of the amenities, it is
in advance of the capitals. So is Mt. Isa.
When I was in Mt. Isa some time ago
milk, hauled from Ingham, 700 miles
away, was being retailed at two bottles
for 9d. Fish, caught at Karumba,
over 300 miles away, are brought
by ’plane. On the mine lease, septic
tanks and electric light are univer-
sal. Brisbane won’t reach that state for
years. The Qantas ’plane is hardly
noticed as it comes and goes. The air
mail is the accepted means of communi-
cation with the South. With coal hauled
over 800 miles, the local powerhouse can
hold its own with Bunnerong and New
Farm. And you should hear the ad-
vanced vocabulary. of the inland towns
when they describe the cities which sneer
at them. I know where the Australian
Shakspeare is most likely to be born.
* # * *
“Tenor”: “Kaloa” (B. 10/10/’34) is
right about the late W. R. O. Hill and
his trouble to deliver a sentence while
sitting on the Bench. Hill became a P.M.
in the happy days when all civil servants
were known individually to Ministers.
The Premier objected to Hill’s promotion
because of the impediment in his speech
—he stuttered like a leaky soda-water
bottle. Hill convinced the head that if
he couldn’t talk he could sing. Many
of his summings-up were done to light-
opera airs of the day. And in many
cases, though the air was light, the sen-
tence was heavy. Hill was the soul of
decorum, his main hobby being the for-
mation and teachership of Sunday
schools. Certainly he was as game as
they were made—as witness his follow-
ing a mad murderer down a shaft at
Ravenswood —but he was always apolo-
getic about his deeds.
* * * *
“Laetitia”: Just dead is old Namai,
last of the Moans. His death recalls one
of the greatest of Torres Strait mas-
sacres. In the ’seventies an English
freighter ran aground on a reef in
Napoleon Passage, and the islanders
made high holiday with the spoils. Badu
natives seized a cargo of cement, think-
ing it flour, and a communal feast was
planned. Unfortunately the cement soli-
dified. There could be only one possible
explanation for this phenomenon—pourri-
pourri by the neighboring Moans, who
had not been invited. The grudge was
treasured for years, until a naval sloop,
en route for Port Essington, grounded on
the same reef. This time the Baduites
were in early, and, unknown to their
rivals, secured a batch of cutlasses. A
courtesy call was made on the neighbors
across the three-mile strait. The cut-
lasses were concealed in the sleeping
mats of the visitors, and the unsuspect-
ing Moans were caught in a hopeless
trap. With one exception they were
wiped out. The one survivor was little
Namai, who hid in the bushes and lived
till three score and ten.
* * * *
“Bushranger’s Improver”: Something
ought to be done to stop the capitalist
press from wasting a hard-workin’ bloke’s
time with misleading statements. Last
week the Brisbane briefs come across
with the dinkum office as to how Alf
Jones, the Mayor, was goin’ all the way
to Melbourne in the new car, with his
solid gold chain stowed away in the port
with the cocked hats and other gilt
clobber, to meet the Dook. Long enough
to go twice round his Ludship it is,
and that’s sayin’ a bit. Five hundred
loverly quid, once yer got it boiled. Me
boss’s idea, him being a miner once, was
to shoot it into lumps of rock and go
round startin’ companies. Reckons he’d
get enough out of them even to pay the
income tax and leave a bit over. An’
here comes the news, after all our ar-
rangements is ready for holdin’ up Alf
in the good old style, that he’s goin’ by
steamer. Them paper blokes ain’t got
no hearts!
* * * *
“Yarri”: Booby Island, in Torres
Strait, where the crew of a sampan re-
cently made a bit of a stir by landing to
“inquire about lights,” is one of the best-
known specks on the map—about a
quarter of a mile long and 60ft high,
EX-PLUMBER: “Which is the cream spout, mister?”
topped with a lighthouse. A century
ago it was chosen by the Queensland
Government as a provision depot for
castaways. In the sailing days its sup-
plies saved many a shipwrecked sailor.
A visitors’ book was provided in which
the castaway could log his landfall and
history. It was a strange volume when
complete. Small as it is, the islet was
once well stocked by nature. Captain
King, in 1820, got a lot of turtles and a
thousand eggs there, and the crew of
the Beagle, in 1844, shot 145 quail, 18
pigeons and 12 rails, while the enormous
number of boobies thereabouts gave the
speck its name.
“Pack Saddle”: “Pandanus” was
rather astute in dragging in settlements
like the Bloomfield and China Camp to
swell the revenue account of Cooktown
(B. 24/10/’34). One source of income
he could have mentioned is the timber
industry, which flourishes. Cooktown
ironwood is one of the most durable of
Australian timbers. Sleepers for the
Cooktown-Laura railway were made of
it 40 years ago. They are still solid.
* * * *
“Gelt”: The mainland of New Guinea
is noted for its goldmines ; now there has
arisen a rush for the “soul mines.” Three
mission societies are making every effort
to establish themselves amongst the
Mount Hagen natives, on the Central
Tableland behind Finisterre, reported on
by Patrol-officer Taylor a few months
ago as possessing a high degree of cul-
ture and agricultural knowledge. Anthro-
pologist Chinnery gave a lecture to the
Melanesian Mission crowd in England,,
and it started a New Guinea appeal
fund. So it is probable that shortly the
mission trio will become a quartet.
* * * *
“Awbeca”: “Mundic” (B. 10/10/’34)
recalls Carlton House and its function
in Mt. Morgan’s roaring days. It was
bought by the Rockhampton Angli-
can Council and shifted bodily to the
seaside. Where once “the race apart” or
“them silvertails” quenched their thirst
and swapped yarns over long cigars, now
schoolgirls live their daily round. Carl-
ton House —it still retains its old name —
is a part of St. Faith’s School, Yeppoon.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Lyla Palmer, who marries Colin Hethering-
ton (her father was Brisbane’s Mayor in 1917)
on November 10, has been the guest of honor
at several tea-parties. Mrs. Hetherington and
Ena and Mrs. C. Henry were hostesses.
The first step towards raising £lO,OOO to
keep the Darnell bequest for the foundation
of a National Gallery, was made at a party
in the grounds of Archbishop Duhig’s home
Wynberg. Daphne Mayo and C. Lancaster
collected the elusive contribution. Altogether
£2OO came in. Archbishop Duhig also threw
open the house to allow the artistically-minded
to admire his pictures, tapestries and furniture.
The gathering was cheery and non-sectarian.
His Ex. came attended by Pat Honnor, also
Anglican Archbishop Wand, Canon Garland,
Rabbi Nathan Levine and Mrs. Levine.
The United Service Club, which is organising
the Royal Ball, to be held on December 6,
wanted to hold it in the City Hall, but the
committee of the United Charities Ball got
in first. After a lot of searching the Aus-
tralian Estates Wool Building, where the Royal
Ball was held during the visit of the Yorks,
has been secured.
Edward Rudolph Stiger, recently appointed
Deputy Registrar-General, was “born into the
Civil Service.” His father was Queensland’s
first Government Analyst, and his son and
daughter also are in the service.
Madame Nadejine and her sister, Mrs.
Ashley Shaw, have left for N. Queensland.
They will visit their cousins the J. Trittons, at
Richmond, and look in on Townsville and
Barcaldine.
St. John’s Cathedral rarely has seen a pret-
tier bride than Valetta Bevington Brady, who
kept her altar date with lan MacPherson Grant
on October 29. Magnolia ring velvet draped
her small person, and she wore a beautiful lace
veil, which fell almost to the end of the train.
This was lent by Mrs. P. H. Allom, and two
days later was included in the luggage of
Audrey Forth when she sailed for Bombay
to marry Tom Warland. Joan Brady was the
chief bridesmaid; she and Audrey were frocked
alike in trained frocks of green. They wore
halos of real flowers, as did the bride, whose
coronet of stephanotis and orchids matched her
bouquet. A. S. B. Brady gave his daughter
away, and Donald and Eric Grant were best
man and groomsman. After the wedding Briga-
dier-General and Mrs. Grant entertained a
number of guests at a cocktail party. The
newly-weds are on a motor tour to Sydney and
the Blue Mountains.
After two and a halQ years over the other
side, Essil Longland returned to Brisbane by
the Orford. Mrs. F. Longland went as far
as Colombo to meet her, as did sister Mrs.
A. R. Archibald, and her husband. Essil has
had a crowded two years. She studied ballroom
dancing in London, taught it in Holland, and
squeezed in cruises to Madeira and the
Norwegian fiords, and a stay in a holiday
camp near Loch Lomond.
Malcolm and Sheila MacDonald have left for
the South, after seeing something of Queens-
land. Malcolm joined his sister in Toowoomba,
but before he left Brisbane our Sir Leslie got
out the silver and gave a bucks’ dinner for
him. Sir John Cadman was one of the guests,
and another was William Teeling, of London,
who represents the Overseas League at the
Melbourne centenary, and is touring Australia.
The Brisbane branch of the Overseas League
welcomed Mr. Teeling to Brisbane; Sir Leslie
introduced him to members.
Sir Maurice Hankey is another notable
visitor. He and Lady Hankey are staying
at Government House, and that should be a
pleasant interlude for them, since our Ex. and
Sir Maurice have a mutual interest —they both
belonged to the Royal Marine Artillery.
Glennie Old Girls held their second
annual bridge party and got a bumper
attendance. The fund is to provide
scholarships for the daughters of
clergymen. Mrs. T. G. Lahey acted
as hostess, and Pauline Elliott (presi-
dent of the association) and Mrs.
John Bale (who was Doreen Morgan),
the lion secretary, assisted to get all
the visitors into their right places. So
large a crowd turned up that extra
accommodation had to be obtained,
and there was an overflow to another
floor of the building.
Dr. J. J. C. Bradfield, who is engaged in
designing the bridge to cross the river from
Bowen Terrace to Kangaroo Point, gave the
members of the Town and Country Women’s
Club a treat when he told them all about Old
Sydney. He has a magnificent collection of
lantern slides..
For the first time since it staged its
ball in Show Week, the United Service Club
opened its doors for an at-home. The new
president, Colonel J. Hill, and Mrs. Hill re-
ceived the guests, the lady wearing midnight
blue with touches of silver. Joan Hill, daughter
of the house, who “came out,” wore Lido
blue. There was a good attendance of the
military and their womenfolk, and there was
a sprinkling of visitors, mainly from the South.
After a long holiday in Queensland, Pat-
ricia Honnor is starting back to England. She
will spend some time in Sydney and Melbourne.
Brisbane is sorry to see her go; and a number
of parties have been staged for her. Mrs. W. T.
Kilgour, aided by daughter Betty, gave a
supper dance at the Bellevue Hotel, and
brother Pat Honnor got a night off from his
aide-ing and came along to enjoy himself.
Rosemary Forbes Mac Kay, daughter of the
Forbes MacKays, of Darling Point, is en-
gaged to Douglas Cotton, third son of Mr. A.
J. Cotton, of Hidden Vale. His sister, Vera
Cotton, by the way, who owns a guesthouse
at Southport, is to have our vice-royalties as
guests this Christmas.
At a musical luncheon a women’s auxiliary
of the R.S.S.I.L.A. handed over a cheque for
£5O towards the fund for the erection of sea-
side homes for distressed returned men and
their families. The Government has made
available three allotments of land at Bilinga
with a sea frontage. The homes will be avail-
able on much the same terms as the C.W.A.
manages its seaside homes, and are to be
used solely to provide holidays for men and
their families who otherwise never would be
able to have a change.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Ferry travellers had a premonitory
thrill over the ducal visit when they
noticed that the pontoon had been put
into position for the royal footprints.
The city fathers have at last got busy,
and the decorations threaten to outdo
Melbourne’s. Tall, white masts tipped
with gold will line the red carpet of the
landing-stage, and will bob up all along
the route, cheerily blazing a trail to Gov-
ernment House. A Mayoral pavilion that
might grace Avalon will rise, pennant
flying, near the landing-point. The
crosses of St. George, St. Andrew and
St. Patrick will strike an impressive note,
W'hile gaiety will be flung to the breeze
by red and blue ensigns. Amid these,
and caught in the surrounding forest of
palms from the Botanic Gardens, gaily-
hued lights will wink to the stars.
There’s a whole forest of masts already
near the gates of Government House,
and the drive up to the vice-regal door-
way will be dressed with flag and pen-
nant and shield. Macquarie-street, as
befits its width and brass plates, will be
dignified and show a line of standards
topped by banners. The statues of King
Edward and Queen Victoria are to be
dolled up with gold-tipped masts and
Union Jacks, and at night Government
House will be floodlit.
Those who bought the old rosewood
and cedar at the Dunmore Lang sale last
week took home with them a flavor of
the early history of Sydney, for many
of the pieces had been in the first home
of the founder of Scots kirk. That was
set up in 1824. The quaint old engrav-
ings, the settees and chairs in their bro-
cades, as rosy as Spanish wine, sur-
rounded the celebrated pastor’s daughter,
Mary Lang, in her Baulkham Hills home
till she, too, slipped into the realm where
there is neither moth nor rust and the
need for wardrobes and chests (the family
seems to have had a passion for them)
ceased to exist.
The old doctor’s desk went to the
Wentworth family for over 20 guineas ;
young Sam Hordern was among the
bidders. One of the Betts family bought
some of the engravings, which seemed
to be knocked down monotonously for
a few shillings apiece. A miniature of
Mrs. Dunmore Lang, set about with
pearls, had 240 guineas bid for it, but
even that offer was rejected. On the
other hand, a charming lacquer tea-
caddy, its lead lining intact, brought only
a few shillings. Old personal treasures
like a grebe tippet and muff (beloved
by our grandmothers), a sealskin muff
and some rare old lace shawls looked
out wistfully from their glass cabinet,
wondering to what use they might be
put in an age when churchgoing is no
longer the event of the week, as it was
when their owners and they too were
young.
Sir Nevile Wilkinson is so much in
demand for openings that in the matter
of art shows he threatens the record of
Sir Hugh Poynter. Still Sir Hugh looks
quite good-natured over it. Perhaps he’s
even a bit relieved. The big show that
Sir Nevile launched last week was the
Women Painters’ exhibition. This is
a before-Christmas annual, and the paint-
ings on the walls are always cabinet size
and modest in price. There is sound
painting and an emancipated color sense
in the present occupants of the B 1 ax-
land Galleries’ walls, and the opening
was one of last week’s social crushes.
Lady Poynter and Carrie Lanceley flew
millinery worth a second glance.
.Flashing eyes that put the electrics to
shame were brought by the erect and
slim officers of the Armando Diaz to
the Littorio Ball. For this jubilation
over their King’s birthday and the Fas-
cist march on Rome, Italy in Sydney had
hung David Jones’s ballroom with the
flags of their own land and of Aus-
tralia ; and in compliment to the guests
of the evening a model of the visiting
warship that greyly crouched on the blue
waters off Farm Cove adorned the table
at which the Governor and the Consular
party sat.
The big hit of the night was, made by
the 18 white-frocked young daughters of
Italy. These bore aloft the Fascist em-
blem and swords jocund with red, white
and green ribands, and formed a guard
of honor for the official guests. Marchesa
Ferrante’s pink laces were the light back-
ground for the armful of deep red roses
the committee thrust on her. Our own
Navy, represented by the C. J. Pope
couple, exchanged politenesses with Cap-
tain lachino, and red roses were the
lady’s favor for the night. She wore
them in company with laces of autumnal
tonings. All the Consuls were there,
and Eva Kuraz sparkled in blue
brocades. Exquisite Chinese embroid-
eries were added to the night’s brightness
by Miss Young Wai, the dove-grey coat
of her costume contrasting with the vivid
red satin of the skirt. The Italian Bene-
volent Fund is the beneficiary of the
dance.
The girl with the level gaze is Valerie
Bavin, youngest of the three popular
daughters of the State’s one-time Premier.
Unlike her mother and sisters, Valerie
has no literary ambitions, though she
does help her author mother with her
correspondence. Otherwise she’s an out-
door girl whose particular craze is surfing
off Bondi Beach.
Macquarie-street was gay one after-
noon last week with party frocks coming
home from the Italian cruiser. Captain
lachino and his officers are experts at
the host game, and served jazz and cock-
tails and savories under red-and-white
awnings for the delight of girls in butter-
fly raiment and their escorts. Many of
these wore the blue-and-gold of Aus-
tralia’s Navy. The others tried to make
up in charm for lack of uniform.
The iridescent cocktail sparkled at the
Forum Club in honor of the visiting
sailors. The Dante Alighieri Society was
the hand that held the shaker, and II
Duce himself would have been proud of
the roll-up of his fellow-countrymen.
Wyldefel at Potts Point, the home of
Italy’s Consul-General, ran up multi-
colored lights in the treetops of its old
garden and spread a dance and other
festivities for the Commander and officers
of the Armando Diaz.
When the Duke of Gloucester drops
into Gostwyck, the Dangar home, he will
have a blessedly peaceful interlude. Only
two guests are invited, and they are not
guests at all, being cousin Harry and an
aunt, who are practically of the house-
hold. The visitors’ book in which the
royal name will be signed is a conser-
vative volume. Its vellum leaves are in
a Wal Taylor binding of silken soft
brown leather stamped with the Dangar
coat-of-arms.
Chief Justice Street’s wife was spokes-
woman for the Victoria Leaguers when
they gathered at the Australia to do
honor to Lady Game. Her speech was
one of eulogy, and was greeted with
swift agreement from softly clapping
gloved hands. The vice-reine’s frock was
an unusual combination of black-and-
white with a Magyar bodice. Her
presentation posy was of deep-red roses,
her hat black and shady. It was an
overflow gathering of glossily-plumaged
women; there was a subtle wedding of
the perfume of roses and delicate
powders, to which
Virginia Bassetti
added the notes of
her magnolia-like
voice.
Ex-trainees of St.

in the Mayoress’s

last week’s bait for
silver currency, and
the roll-up was a
testimony to the
popularity of the
Vincentians.
The mantel with
its spikes of yellow

a hillside in Maori-

Mayoress Parker’s

gleaned a posy of

Lorgnettes and
magnifying - glasses
will be given an
airing at the show
of Sir Nevile Wilkinson’s Titania Palace
decorations. These delicate paintings, ex-
quisite in details, will be on view at the
Grosvenor Galleries from Monday, and
the sixpence entrance fee goes to the
Crippled Children’s fund. The works,
which have already been exhibited at the
Royal Academy, are not for sale. On
backgrounds of sea blues and faintest
coral pinks scattered with star dust,
Titania and her Court go their airy ways.
Sometimes her Iridescent Highness is
whirled by a pair of sea-horses, one
white, one sable, up through a flowering
blue sea, her outriders, chubby Tritons,
spraying golden mists through their horns.
The ceiling for the banqueting hall is
sensitively gay with petal blues and
pinks, butterfly wings and garlands of
flowers. Shrined amid it's delights are
the names of all who have been lovers
of faery—Lewis Carroll, Spenser, Barrie,
Shakspeare. There are the chapel ceil-
ings and panels for Oberon’s study for
further delight.
There’s a dance fixture at Rose Bay
Golf Club on Saturday, the 24th., and
the burning question is, “Will the Duke
be there or not?” The first idea was that
he could enjoy a nice quiet evening
looking down from Government House
on the Venetian Carnival; and when
he got tired of that, or when the last
hunger had gone off, he could have a
fling at the small-size vice-regal dance
that would probably hover a jazzy
accompaniment to the illuminations.
However, as nothing is scheduled for
that night, a glorious uncertainty wraps
the hours.
The unexpected death of Mrs. L. P.
Sibley meant a sorrowful week-end for
her many friends. The news will stir
Broken Hill, too, for L. P. Sibley has
been long associated with the B.H.P. Co.
Mrs. Sibley was a vice-president of the
American Women’s Club in Paris, and
had the distinction of being sent for
during the war by the White House in
Washington for the work in the canning
and preserving -of fruits and vegetables
which she inaugurated and controlled at
her own residence. Her generosity and
kindnesses recognised no frontiers.
The Dutch fliers have been the heart-
throb of the week. Not that they tried
to be, but in a city deserted by every
male able to scrape the time and the
fare to go to the Cup the sedate but
daring airmen were as exhilarating as
a permanent wave to dank hair. Nether-
landers in Sydney, at the instigation of
the A. Bakker couple, met in the Went-
worth to congratulate Parmentier and
Moll, Van Brugge and Prins. The
aviators were presented to the hordes of
guests in the ballroom, and cocktails
were drunk, the Dutch National Anthem
sung, and with the quartet there to prove
that the journey could be done in five
days the tulips of Canberra and of
Amsterdam seemed next-door neighbors.
The Consular Staals set out a dinner
and dance in their home on Bellevue Hill
for their countrymen, and among others
dos to their glory was a lunch by the
Millions Club.
When the State Orchestra which Henri
Verbrugghen, then ruler of the Con.,
led through the stormy reverberations of
Wagner and the thunders of all loud-
speaking composers was disbanded,
musical Sydney wept into its hanky and
sobbed about the age of canned music.
Now we have a State orchestra once
again. It made its first public appear-
ance under Director of the Conserva-
torium Dr. Edgar Bainton at the Town
Hall last week. The orchestra was there,
but there were more seats than listeners.
However, the applause was loud and
prolonged. The vice-regals gave the
arts a boost in force, not only Sir Philip
and his lady but son Philip being among
those who clapped their palms into a
healthy glow. Elise Budge came with
the Government House party, as did the
Philip Street couple, and they, too, sent
up salvos of applause from the front
rows. Chairman of the Broadcasting
Commission Cleary was in the audience.
Sydney aesthetes who usually crowd
out every art-show opening stayed away
in cohorts from the National Gallery
the other afternoon when Contemporary
British Art was being introduced by
knight Philip Street. Gallery director
MacDonald rounded up the sheep who
were browsing on art in the furthermost
corners, and got them into a nice com-
pact little mob before the speaker. His
wife turned the ear of attention from
beneath a shady brim. John Lane
Mullins and Barbara were among the
faithful, as were the just-returned-from-
Europe Mrs. Sidney Jamieson, Sydney
Ure Smith and the good-looking Mrs.
Inglis Moore, very striking in her white
hat and frock and hair like black satin.
John D. Moore ruminated before some
tough-looking chess-players who seemed
to be caught in action just as their ship
was sliding down into the trough of the
wave. Pleasant, next-door neighbors are
the “Family in Bloomsbury,” whose papa
shows a dash of canary waistcoat.
Undeterred by air race or princely
visits, Kathleen Belbridge, of Bellevue
Hill, went serenely on with preparations
for her nuptials. St. John’s in Darling-
hurst smiled on the result: one of the
prettiest weddings of the week, with a
bride picturesque in beige and caramel
browns. The bridegroom was Russell
Hicks, one time of Queensland. Bride’s
sister Lydia ’maided in an ivory and
brown composition. The cocktail of con-
gratulation was drunk at the Forum
Club.

Famous visitors from all parts of the
world have given the warmest praise
to New Zealand’s Alpine Wonderland,
which has mountaips of marvellous
beauty, the largest glaciers of tem-
perate zones, huge ice-falls and other
splendour, with a most delightful tonic
climate.
The Hermitage, commanding a soul-
stirring view of Mt. Cook (12,350 ft.),

Melbourne
Chatter
On Saturday Melbourne women looked
at the sky and wondered if spring hats
would be safe at the Derby. They were
safe, for when the weather finally made
up its mind just before the first race it
did the thing properly and chased away
the clouds to reveal a serene sky.
An English visitor to the committee box
in the grandstand was General Home’s
wife, clad in ink-blue. With Mrs. Roy
Chambers was Mrs. A. Benbow Bullock,
of Auckland. She travelled across the
Tasman with her brother, Captain
Donald Simson, who chose the U.S.
route from London to Melbourne. An-
other overseas visitor was Dr. Dina
Russell, who wore a black coat with
rolled cartridge shoulders for her last
flutter on the Australian turf before
leaving by road for Sydney, where she
will board the Nankin for her home and
dental surgery in Kobe, Japan.
Mrs. Tom Paterson wore one of her
smart hats recently bought in the U.S.A.;
it was of brown taffetas with a spread of
parrot’s wing across the front. Billie
Herman wore beige and dusty-pink
checks, and Mrs. Ron Nettlefold splashed
her millinery with white as a tonic for
her navy ensemble. Tucks ran up and
down Betty Erswell’s black dress with
its intricacy of cape. Mrs. S. Wert-
heim’s good looks were especially strik-
ing in her suit of a plainly-cut white
coat over black. Nan Brett wore a shell-
shaped accessory of ice-blue on her
darker-blue frock, and Valerie Baldock’s
black dress had a silver yoke.
The Duke’s country tour commenced
with a week-end at Ercildoune with the
Alan Curries and was to have concluded
at Mawallock, the Alec Russell’s station
home. Unfortunately plans were changed
owing to H.R.H.’s indisposition. The
Duke’s brief appearance at Henley was
followed by a week-end rest at G.H. as
a preliminary to the hectic gaieties of
Cup Week.
The Henley girl had brilliant sunshine
and a mild still night for the wearing
of her fluffy river clothes and floppy
canoe hat. Among the five decorated
houseboats the Lord Mayor’s was dressed
up like “Oranges and Lemons, the Bells
of St. Clemens.” Young trees in tubs,
their branches heavy with fruit (growing
and synthetically attached), made an
aromatic arbor from which guests viewed
the river pageant by day and night.
People who went to Canberra for the
Federal Capital’s giddy week complained
of tired limbs. There were very few
chairs at the garden party; tea and
cream cakes were balanced from an up-
right angle, and there was practically
nowhere to sit at the ball —guests who
were invited to the dens of political
friends were indeed lucky. Lots of people
went home hungry, for the fifth supper
sitting didn’t come on till 1 a.m. There
was a buffet, but the Commonwealth
possesses but one official bottle-opener,
which somehow got lost in the crowd.
Whisky-and-water was therefore the
general thirst-quencher. All the taxis in
Canberra were commandeered for official
guests, so people without cars had to be
particularly sweet to those who owned
conveyances.
The biggest ball of the week was given
by the Naval and Military Club in the
Town Hall. For decorative purposes the
stage was commandeered to serve as a
garden, the band doing its job upstairs
in the gallery. Trumpeters also went
aloft for their vocal warning of the
approach of official guests and for bugle
calls to supper. Scarlet ropes made a
pathway through the crowd for a proces-
sion, which included Lord and Lady
Milne, Vice-Admiral Hyde and his lady,
General and Mrs. Bruche and Sir Alan
Anderson and his distinguished wife. She
looked beautiful in the difficult-to-wear
shade of with a pewter-
colored halo exactly matching her hair.
Uncle Sam’s officers added to the
glitter with ropes of gold braid, gold
rings round their cuffs, stars and eagles.
Among so much scarlet, gold and blue,
Col. Simpson’s purple embellishments
of the signallers were noticeable for their
subdued note. The Consul for the Nether-
lands brought Mrs. Wright, wearing tur-
quoise tucked in diagonal furrows. Mrs.
R. T. A. McDonald placed a single water-
lily upon the shoulder of her white satin
gown, and Squadron-Leader Bladin’s wife
wore pink shot with metal threads and a
pool of silver lame at her throat. Mrs.
Norman Shepherd’s gown was also
metallic in its lustre, shaded green leaves
throwing up a pattern to match the stiff
taffeta sash. Olga Farnsley wore orchid
crepe and Flight-Lieut. Thomas’s better-
half was swathed in satin the color of
ripe apricots.
The profile by Dickinson-Monteath is
of Mrs. H. L. Quick, who interpreted the
part of Queen Charlotte at the Court
scene in the naval pageant. Commander
Spooner was George 111., and several
naval officers’ wives were attendant ladies
of the Court during the reception in honor
of Captain Cook. Mrs. Quick is well
known among her friends for her delight-
ful luncheon parties. Commander Quick’s
hobby is the building of model ships
which are a credit to his patience and
skilful fingers.
The centenary naval pageant held on
the Showground was a great success
and a credit to the organisers and the
600 people taking part. On each night
the audience occupying stands and stand-
ing-room enlightened upon the life
of Captain Cook: in Tahiti he was en-
tertained with island foods and a dance
by dusky maidens ; at Botany Bay he
met some very black abos.; in the next
scene he was received at Court, and,
finally, he gave up his ghost from a
spear flung on a beach in Hawaii. The
naval men danced hornpipes, drilled and
produced a squad of marines of 1770
in scarlet-and-white uniforms who per-
formed target practice. Larger squads
did funeral drill in commemoration of the
death of Nelson and fired their muskets
in a feu de joie for the victory of Trafal-
gar. (One lad had a bad ragging on the
first night, for his ancient weapon went
off at the wrong time.)
There was a fight to the teeth on the
decks of the Golden Hind when Drake’s
men tossed the Spaniards overboard, but
a better contest was a naval battle be-
tween British and French frigate squad-
rons of 1794. The models, made to
scale with workable sails, were illu-
minated in such a manner that they
alone were visible in the pitch-dark
arena. Swallowed up by the darkness the
men carrying them interpreted the ocean
swell of the Bay of Biscay. At the dress
rehearsal the guns in several modern
episodes woke up all the babies in
Footscray and put wild ideas into the
heads of imaginative people, so they
were fired with quarter charge through-
out the pageant. An 1880 interlude was
given by country lads and lasses, who
romped on a village green near a tavern
and several cages of stuffed parrots.
They danced with soldiers and with
sailors, known at rehearsals as “earps”
(their dressing-room is marked “sailors
and earps”)—members of the Vic.
Liedertafel called after their conductor,
Frederick Earp. Many of the earps are
grandfathers.
One of the most spectacular efforts
was the first Australian convoy as it
sailed towards Cocos Island on Nov. 9,
1914. As the ships, built to scale, painted
accurately, etc., moved across the dark
arena hidden spotlights from their mast-
heads reflected ripples of light on the
grass. The Sydney, leaving the 28 mer-
chantmen to the care of the Melbourne
and the Ibuki, sailed off to fight the
Emden. Commander A. D. Nicholl was
the producer, Commander Burnett one
of the stage managers and Commander
Quick the “voice” which interpreted
naval happenings through a loudspeaker.
The announcement that the air-race
flyers would be present at a gala night
of “White Horse Inn” acted like a
magician’s wand on the box-office. Every
seat was occupied and the heads of
crowds overflowing into the street looked
from a distance like caviare. For taking
a movie film powerful spotlights were
rigged up in the foyer with a devastating
effect on everybody, for faces under their
glare became purple and brown fur
coats turned green. After the show
Macpherson Robertson, with the aid of
several pages of speech, introduced Scott
and Black, the Dutchmen and Mac-
Gregor and Walker. The Maorilanders,
who had no speeches to make, looked
as if they hated the ordeal and would
have been far happier flying over the
Timor with their one gallant little engine.
The air-race competitors have discov-
ered the disabilities of adulation. They
get very little sleep, have forgotten what
privacy means, and their hands are
cramped from signing autographs. Mac-
Gregor is not such a good showman as
he is a pilot. He looks as if he’d like
to do a bolt to some lonely, inaccessible
island far from telephones or public
functions. His pal Walker has the busi-
ness head of the pair, and is losing much
of his trepidation at so much publicity.
When the Douglas and the M.L. ’plane
were side by side in the Laverton hangar
they looked like mother and baby—the
little Manawatu provided no overhead
shelter for her pilots on the journey half-
way round the world.
On the Boeing is practically everything
but Roscoe Turner’s photograph. Printed
in large letters is “Colonel Roscoe
Turner, Aviation Adviser to Warner
8r05.,” “Warner Bros.’ Comet,” many
“Boeings,” large red stars, U.S. and Aus-
tralian flags and the names of the
engines, “Nip” and “Tuck.”
The expression of joie de vivre belongs
to June Dyson, one of the debs, at G.H.
ball. She chose white taffetas softened
with a lace bertha and golden hair orna-
ments to make her curtsy to royalty.
June, who is the only child of Mrs. Ted
Dyson, has an inclination for drawing,
her favorite subjects being nymphs,
fawns and other imaginative creatures.
The late Ted Dyson was a writer of
standing. Dickinson-Monteath portrait.
One of last week’s most-talked of
dances was given by Mrs. H. F. Creswick
and her daughter Sheila. The floral deco-
rations were superb. In lounges, entrance-
hall and supper-rooms were baskets of
rhododendrons, watsonias, delphiniums
and foxgloves, and tall vases and shallow
bowls filled with the spoils of spring. In
the gallery hidden lights threw the pic-
tures into relief, while the rest of the
room was bathed in a soft, luminous
glow. Both mother and daughter wore
their Court gowns. Mrs. Creswick’s was
of ivory with a mingling of petal threads
and a golden girdle, and Sheila’s was a
tulle creation, ethereal as a spray of lily-
of-the-valley.
For her coming-out dance G. R.
Nicholas’s daughter Betty wore her pre-
sentation gown of white net made with
a cunning bustle and elaborate train, and
a twinkle of silver mixed among its fluffi-
ness. The flowers were magnificent
throughout the Nicholas home in Lan-
sell-road. A new idea was the decora-
tion of curtains with blossom's ; one heavy
drapery was elaborate with blooms and
tendrils, among which Betty’s initials
were worked in roses.
For a “Coming-out Party” in St. Kilda
Town Hall the Vic. Artists’ Society
lassoed American visitors. At supper
Colonel Roscoe Turner divided his atten-
tion equally between Mrs. Jimmy Dyer
(who removed her crinoline attachment
so that she could sit in comfort among
her pale-green flounces) and prawns —
for at artists’ dances one peels one’s own
Crustacea. Col. Farquar son in the bril-
liant plumage of the U.S. Marines was
so overcome at hearing himself declared
the winner of the “best sustained male
character” that he vanished completely.
(It is not recorded whether he waited to
collect his prize of a bottle of gin.) The
decorations were drawings of exotic
ladies and comical gentlemen, and very
effective square lampshades. A favored
few managed to collect the Vic. Artists’
centenary medal upon which the historic
ram wears such accessories as goggly
eyes, the suggestion of a grin, a beer-
barrel for a collar and an artist’s cap
on one of his curly horns. On the
reverse side a plump painter (who has
never starved in a garret) is let loose
with his brushes on one of the city’s
“candy-poles.”
Champagne bubbled at Mrs. Norman
Brookes’s late-afternoon party given for
the officers of the Augusta. Despite a
lowering sky, guests risked their spring
millinery. Noel Clapp’s green-and-black
hat, which owes its existence to a Chinese
inspiration, was a tremendous success
until Margery Stephens arrived wearing
its twin counterpart.
The sides of the Palais threatened to
burst at the Flying Corps Association’s
Ball. When the air-race competitors
came up for air after an onslaught of
autograph fiends, Wing-Commander
“King” Cole wouldn’t let them just sit
and talk ; he kept them moving about
for more and more introductions.
The Vic. Bridge Assoc, bit off a large
mouthful, but not more than it could
swallow in running a Thousand Players’
Bridge Tourney, which, as far as is
known, is the largest function of the sort
ever organised anywhere. Tables filled
the Melbourne Town Hall and an extra
room upstairs, and 500 would-be entrants
were regretfully turned away. Supper,
served in relays in the lower hall, was
included in the 3s. 6d. entrance fee.
Players had a choice of auction or several
grades of contract, rubber or duplicate.
S. N. Lythgo gave instructions, but early
in the evening a few people having their
first try at duplicate got into deep water
with boards and scoring, and had to be
rescued by committee members in charge
of the section. For distribution among
the competitors there were 60 centenary
cups and rose-bowls. One pair who blew
along with the East-Wests were Mrs.
Frank Smith, wife of the V.B.A.’s hon.
sec., and S. H. Deamer ; Mrs. Deamer
and Norman Brookes were planted
among the stationary North-Souths. On
every table was “Others are playing;
please discuss it quietly.” During the
evening presentations were made to the
Vic. team who recently cleaned up its
inter-State opponents, the victorious Vic.
women’s team and the runners-up, among
whom were Mrs. Jamieson, in a black
dress and silver embellishments, Eileen
Mussen in blue velvet, Mrs. N. D.
Lemon, with a pierrette ruffle round her
neck, and Mrs. Frank Smith. Competi-
tors made special trips from country dis-
tricts to take part in the unique bridge
function.
The Tristan Buesst couple, returned
from honeymooning abroad, have de-
cided that there are more sharks in
Geneva’s shops than in all the seven
seas —money in Geneva simply melts.
The couple occupied a few square inches
in the packed hall when Russia entered
the League of Nations, and when the
Soviet Foreign Commissar, M. Litvinoff,
made his maiden and quite unintelligible
speech. During the translation the crowd
decided it was time to go and eat and
pushed its way jabbering in all sorts of
tongues out of the room.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The arrival of the French sloop Amiral
Charner with Commander Adelus and his
officers has been our big social event.
First there was a civic reception. In the
afternoon the French Consul, Arnold
Moulden, and his wife gave a cocktail
party at their North Adelaide home. As
the weather was very sultry, refreshments
were served on the lawn. Miss Valentine
Adams (Sydney), who is on a visit to her
sister, Mrs. Moulden, assisted in enter-
taining the guests. That same evening
L’Alliance Fran?aise joined forces with
Prof, and Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson in
holding a dance and musical at Urrbrae
for the visitors. Mdlle. Marcel Berardi
sang French songs, and Joy Parsons con-
tributed a solo dance. Mrs. Richardson
sported hyacinth-blue chiffon velvet.
Next day L’Alliance Franfaise gave a
luncheon party at the South Australian
Hotel, when Commander Adelus and his
officers were the guests of honor, the
tables arranged with red roses, white
gypsophalia and blue irises. President
W. W. Goodhart made a speech, and the
Commander responded. After lunch
Mrs. H. S. Hudd took the visitors in
cars to Gawler, where they were the
guests of Mrs. Hudd’s brother and his
wife, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Law-Smith.
That evening Dr. and Mrs. Beard (the
lady is French) gave a dinner dance for
the officers at the South Australian. The
following day Mrs. H. S. Hudd and
several women members of L’Alliance
Fran9aise organised a picnic party at
Long Gully, when they entertained 60
men and the officers. The men engaged
in football and tennis.
Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson (president of
the Uni. Wives’ Association) received
Lady Dugan, who paid her visit to the
new Uni. buildings, and presented her
with a bouquet of golden emblem roses
tied with blue and gold ribbons. The
Governor’s wife was frocked in a
brown and putty-toned toilette, and wore
a smart brown hat. She was accom-
panied by her secretary, Miss Roberts.
At morning-tea the speechmakers were
Douglas Mawson’s lady, Mrs. Richard-
son and Madeline Angel (president of
the Uni. Women’s Union)..
The Hallowe’en celebration at the
Palais Royal was a crowded affair.
Bairns were there in hundreds, and held
the floor until 9 p.m., when they enjoyed
supper in a large marquee. The pipe
band and kilted children provided the
Scots flavor, and a further touch was
supplied by wives and daughters of
chieftains past and present, each wearing
a tartan sash across their evening frocks.
Chief Maxwell Fotheringham and his
wife received near the entrance, Mrs.
Fotheringham smartly gowned in apricot
angel-skin lace. Lud Mayor Cain and
the acting-Mayoress, Mrs. Dunstan, were
present, the lady in pale apple-green flat
crepe. Mrs. George Ritchie chose bur-
gundy-toned chiffon velvet with gold
tissue on the corsage. Mrs. Malcolm
Mclntosh wore black chiffon velvet.
WESTRALIA.
The 200 Club Ball at the Embassy
put a bushel of shekels in the coffers
of the Children’s Hospital. The
Mitchell lady swept her trained green
satins and presentation crimson roses
into the v.-r. box after the wel-
come by president D. Dudley arid
Shirley Deshon, whose dewy diamente
shone on pastel-blue matt crepe. A wave
of frills surged over Gladys Hadley’s
floral-blue ninons; Flo Broadhurst’s
honey satins clasped her throat but left
her back bare; Ruth Clifton’s field of
Indian maize was dotted \yith tiny
flowers; a broncho collar set off Peter
Smith’s red-and-white-plaid taffetas ; and
Mrs. H. J. Minors sprinkled posies on
her ciel-blue crepe romaine.
An all-girl cast was responsible’ for
the warm reception of “Intermezzo di
Carnevale” at the University Italian
Club’s at-home. The foyer of Winthrop
Hall resounded to Betty Gravenall’s easy
portrayal of Fabritzia, Evelynn Shack-
lock’s shrieking Nicoletta and Lorna
Newman, Gwen Pascoe and Aileen Cox
in smaller roles.
Giant impressionist bluebells ran riot
in the ballroom at the Pleiades Club
dance; they climbed over the variegated
blue lattice which semi-concealed the
orchestra on the dais, and mounted the
pillars to the swaying forest of blue
streamers overhead. In the supper-room
the color scheme was maintained with
delphiniums and larkspurs. The newly-
elected club president, Florence Arm-
strong, strapped her black radio-wave
satins with diamente ; Mrs. G. S. Nor-
ton’s hyacinth-blue matelasse was self-
striped; secretary Jeanne Parker com-
bined black lace arid georgette; Beryl
Birchley chaired the dance committee in
autumn-toned check marquisette, and
Nancy Craven Griffiths spun a web of
ice-blue lace.
A goodly crowd gathered at the News-
paper House art gallery for the opening
of the Society of Arts’ exhibition. Mar-
garet Saunders, swinging a sepia marocain
ensemble, was congratulated on her prize-
winning portrait “Sheilagh,” and Miss
F. V. Hall’s burnt sienna tweeds were
surrounded by admirers of her success-
ful landscape “Winter’s Afternoon:
Applecross.”
Colombo chronicles tell of the mar-
riage of Molly, fourth daughter of the
King’s Park-road Brennans, to F. Arling-
ton-Bourke. Molly’s ivory satins, mediae-
val-cut and long-sleeved, were covered
with a Limerick veil which had formed
part of her Court outfit. Her sister, Mrs.
Peter Vigne, was matron of honor, and
presided over the after-rejoicings at the
Suisse Hotel.
Karrinyup Country Club closed its
season with an afternoon and evening
shivoo at its profusely beflowered club-
house. Mrs. John Dwyer won the flag
competition, and Mrs. Kirke Godfrey
collected the prize for the long-handicap
players. After dinner Barbara Clarke
wrested the bridge prize from the other
card-shufflers.
Major-General Sir Fabian Ware and
Lady Ware were guests at a number of
functions while the Orontes was berthed
at Fremantle. Fellow-passengers who
returned to the West were Mr. and Mrs.
Ernest Lee Steere and daughter Muriel,
and Molly and Rita McGibbon.
Joan Solomon and Gwenyth Allen
shook cocktails for a host of friends of
Erica Patterson, whose luggage was on
board the Gorgon, labelled “Singapore,”
where her marriage to Stewart Douglas
will take place.
TASMANIA.
The Naval and Military Club staged
its dance at the Masonic Hall. President
Col. H. N. Butler received the v.-r. party,
which included besides his Ex. and Lady
Clark Captain Matheson (A.D.C.) and
Miss Macdonald, the Military Comman-
dant and Mrs. Whitham, Lieut.-Com-
mander Heriot and Mrs. Heriot, Lieut.-
Col. J. W. Turner, Mr. Thos. Lyons,
Lieut, and Mrs. G. H. Evans. Lady
Clark wore mauve georgette with a little
coat to match. Uniforms brightened the
scene and the supper-tables had an
orange-hued scheme of decoration.
Mrs. Douglas Parker and Helen
Onslow were joint hostesses at a very
jolly dance at the Onslows’ house, Turriff
Lodge, New Norfolk, the other evening.
The guest of honor was Alison Gray.
Turriff Lodge was the “country seat” of
Governor Arthur in the old days, and
the big drawing-room gives ample space
for a dance. Great bowls of lilac were
the chief decoration in the ballroom, and
the supper-room was pink with tulips
and sweet-peas. •
Mrs. C. W. Grant gave a party at the
Queen Mary Club by way of welcome
to Mrs. James Murray, her sister-in-law.
Daughters Dora and Mrs. D. McDougall
helped their mother with the handshak-
ing.
Mrs. J. Smith, for many years an un-
tiring worker as president of the North-
ern Tas. Bush Nursing scheme, is retir-
ing. By way of farewell, Elvie Quigley
and Mrs. Dulling gave a tea-party in her
honor at the Brisbane, Launceston,
where the lounge was a mass of antir-
rhinums and Iceland poppies. There was
a good roll-up of members ; and Mayor-
ess Hollingsworth, Miss Gee and Mr.
Jackson made music.
Matron Jane Power, retiring after
close upon 50 years’ work at the Tas.
Mental Diseases Hospital, was invested
at Government House with an M.B.E.
At the same time Col. L. M. Mullen,
D. 5.0., received his C.M.G. at the hands
of his Ex. It was a cheerful little cere-
mony, attended by a group of friends
who were entertained at morning-tea.

And So The Holden Story Grew
• Who would have thought that the Saddlery
and Leather business established by Holden’s
fifty years ago would be the genesis of one of
our important secondary industries? In 1917,
when the firm was engaged in coach-building,
the first Holden motor body was produced. In
subsequent years the annual production of
Holden bodies has reached as high as 45,000.
The South Australian plant at Woodville alone
covets 40 acres, and employs 3,200 Australians.
Recognised as of a quality that equals the
world’s best, the products of this vast plant are
a tribute indeed to the craftsmanship of the
Holden organisation. That is one reason why
“Body by Holden” should be part of the
description of your next car .. . for those three
words ensure that your money buys the most in
beauty, comfort, and extra durability under
Australian conditions. There are other reasons,
too . . . for every good Australian is interested
in a secondary industry which uses Australian
materials, employs Australians and distributes
profits to Australian shareholders.

The Forcing Response.
BY
DR H.L. TONKIN
The Culbertson system recommends a
forcing response on certain types of
hands containing three and a half honor
tricks. You are not bound to this course
just because your hand is of this strength;
you may have no biddable suit, or the
rest of your holding may be too
“skinny.” With just the bare honor
tricks, it is better to make a simple suit
answer, or to bid two no-trumps. If
partner has opened on a minimum, there
is probably no game in the hand. The
situation becomes interesting, however,
where the hand contains fewer than the
regulation number of high cards, but has
excellent support for the opener and a
good suit outside. The bid can be raised
to game immediately, but one feels that
there may be more in it. Distribution-
ally, there may be a perfect fit, if the
partnership is given a chance to find it.
Then it is that, in spite of textbooks,
some irregular type of force may well
be risked. In the recent Buller-Almacks
match, Mr. Alan Kehoe was the perpe-
trator of a much-disputed bid. One
critic says it was “atrocious” ; another
calls it “brilliant.” He held: —
♦—A, K
—A, 10, x, x
♦ —Q, x, x, x
4 —X, X, X
His brother called one heart, and after
consideration the response was three
diamonds. This is not so much a gamble
as it looks ; after all, it is an even-money
chance that the heart bidder’s outside
strength is diamonds and not clubs, and
it does not cost much to find out. It
so happened that the original heart bid
consisted of: —
4— 10
V—Q, 6, 5, 4, 3
—A, K, 10, 2
X-A, Q, 3
Colonel Buller says that the slam should
not be bid. Technically, he is right, as
it depends on a break in both hearts and
diamonds and a finesse in clubs. How-
ever, the Kehoes bid and made it, as the
result of a most unorthodox force.
Another deal, which was bid to the
limit only at one table, is commented
upon by Mr. M. O. Sale. It shows an
intelligent grasp of the forcing principle.
Here are both hands: —
North.
4 —A, J, 10, 7, 5, 4, 2
V—A, 10, 9
♦ —A
*-Q. 5
South.
4— K, Q, 9, 8, 6, 3
V-K, Q, J
♦—9, 8
*-A, K
When North bid one spade, South could
certainly see a small slam, but he wanted
to know if his partner had all tne miss-
ing aces before calling the “grand.” He
forced with three clubs, and got three
spades in reply. This was not much use,
so he bid four clubs. This time the in-
formation was forthcoming; North re-
plied with four no-trumps, and South
brightly called seven spades. Even
though the force is not always strictly
according to the book, the principles of
safety are observed by making it in a
lower ranking suit, so that the forcer is
able to keep some control of the bidding
by reverting to the original trump at any
time.
There are, however, certain hands of
very even distribution on which it be-
hoves the responding player to go gently.
At first sight they are worth a three no-
trump reply or better, and on further
consideration a force seems indicated in
order to reveal any slam possibilities.
The force should only be tried on these
deals with a very thoughtful partner, who
will stop when he sees that you don’t
appreciate his responses. This is the
sort of hand I mean: —
4 —Q, J, x
V—A, K, x
♦—A, K, 10
4— x, X, X, X
The danger is that the opener’s hand may
be evenly distributed also, and that you
will finish in a spade or no-trump slam,
impossible of fulfilment, because he is
unable to visualise your hand after your
first forcing bid.
Mr. Sale says truthfully that “Culbert-
son is an elastic system, and is not meant
for morons, colonels and robots.” Never-
theless, to be continually putting a strain
on your partner’s imagination and powers
of card-placing will end in his becoming
mentally fagged or, what is worse, dis-
trustful of your bids.
The Figure Complex.
Back in the early days of auction cer-
tain “counts” were popular for the esti-
mation of the hand at a no-trump bid.
Of these the “Robertson” was best
known. Before this the “rule of 11”
was quoted and handled readily by the
disciples of R. F. Foster. Then came
Milton Work’s count, and later George
Reith’s count; more recently still, the
Winslow figure Twelve.
These aids to hand-valuation are of
undoubted assistance to beginners, but
my objection to them is that they are
too mechanical, and ignore the fluctua-
tions brought about by the bidding. A
hand which counts 12 when dealt may
be worth 20 after certain bidding on its
right, and only worth six after a repeated
show of strength on its left. I have
seen numerous deals where the combined
hands counted up to far more than was
necessary to get game, and yet, even
under the best conditions, must fail by
two tricks. The trouble with the count
is that it considers only top cards, and
takes no stock in distribution. The better
the player, the more he tries to picture
the layout of his partner’s hand. Top
cards are powerful weapons, but they
can’t override the game like a proces-
sion of tanks. To stretch the thing to
an absurdity, remember the famous
“Cumberland” deal where three aces
and four kings in one hand tailed to
take a trick. To compute the trick-wm-
ning powers of any holding, the honor-
trick or quick-trick system is much
sounder. It allows for somp variation
according to the bidding, and it impresses
upon the beginner that his values may
alter by reason of the suit lengths in his
and partner’s hands.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
M.B. (Woollahra, N.S.W.).—In the
example given, the player sitting North
was just “asking for it.” A player who
cannot recognise when the cards are run-
ning badly and insists on pushing into
the bidding on insufficient strength is a
bad partner. This failing is not con-
fined to poor players. The vanity of
some much better ones is such that they
cannot resist the temptation to bluff with
poor hands, even when both opponents
have shown strength.
P. R. P. Nelson (M.L.).—The “Barton”
club, which is merely an embroidery of
the Vanderbilt and the Whitelaw clubs,
is not at present popular in Sydney or
in Melbourne. It seems strange to find
it firmly entrenched in your home town.
If so many of your opponents are play-
ing it, you are bound to learn it,
though not to use it, as you cannot
depend on a hurried exposition before
the start of play. Stick to your own
system, Sims or Culbertson, and no
“club” will stun you.
E.C. (Double Bay, N.S.W.).—Thanks
for appreciation. You will find teams of
four matches the most interesting form
of duplicate, and also the best method
of improving your game.

Humorous Competition Sketch:-
GENESIS OF AN
ART CRITIC
BY "WOOSH"
DRAWINGS BY ARIA.
“Lousy J” I said heartily.
TOTYERWANT t’ go t’ th’ Art
yy Gallery for?” queried Blobbs,
emerging with dripping upper
lip from the cool cavern of his schooner.
“Want t’ see real pictures come up ’n’
look over some o’ my stuff.”
I shook my head chastely ; I’d already
examined some of Blobbs’s fantasias,
and, although at that time I might not
have known much about Art, I knew
what I liked. Since becoming an art
critic I have found a number of people
with the same idea.
“The same again,” I said to the bar-
maid lounging near the beer-pumps fil-
ing her nails and eyeing us with languid
interest; the remark being designed to
draw the sting from my refusal to visit
the Blobbs atelier.
The ruse worked. When the frothing
measures had been set before us, Blobbs
drew a tattered notebook from his
pocket.
“How many’s that, six?” He gazed
rheumily into space. “Six it is ; that’s
three beers I owe y’. Settle up when I
“I’ll come too.”
sell me next picture.” The notebook
went back into his pocket, and he sighed
with relief. “Well, that’s settled. Never
did like hotting on a bloke.”
When we came up for air again the
schooners were half-empty and Blobbs
was hanging on to my lapels.
“Listen,” he said, “no good y’ goin’
t’ th’ Art Gallery by y’self. Tell y’ what:
I’ll come too. Show y’
all the good stuff.”
That was fair enough.
THE gallery engulfed
us, on arrival, with-
out any visible discom-
fort ; the attendant at
the turnstile regarded us
with weary cynicism as
we clicked our way in-
side.
With the natural awe
of one who was entering
for the first time this
mausoleum of dead and
gone egos, I trod warily.
I felt indeed that I should
be walking on tiptoe.
Blobbs scuffed along
with all _ the careless abandon of the
suburban householder who is in his own
“Mon Repos” and feels he can throw his
weight about.
We had not penetrated far when I
hiccupped loudly. Fortunately, I had the
presence of mind to stop dead and look
about me in an aggrieved fashion.
Blobbs halted in mid-stride, as did a
gentleman in a smart straw hat with a
red band round it.
“Who did that?” Blobbs said in a
loud voice.
I shrugged, continuing to peer around.
Convinced by my bearing of innocence,
Blobbs bent a shocked gaze on the
wearer of the straw hat until that worthy,
who had been regarding us with an air
of suspicious disapproval, wilted under
the silent attack and slunk off.
I could see that Blobbs was intent on
hurrying me along" until we came to
some favorite section of the gallery he
had in mind. But I refused to be
bustled. A picture caught my eye. I
claim no credit for noticing it; even a
person without my natural instinct
could have seen that here was a big
piece of art. It would have covered the
entire wall of a fair-sized two-storey
house and still left some scraps over to
Gentleman in a smart
straw.
decorate the maid’s room. It was a
nice picture, all blue and kind of
tawny ; it made me think of my dear
wife Martha, who always uses
Blinker’s blue for washing because the
advertisements are so bright.
BLOBBS was at my side.
“Lovely, isn’t it?” I said.
“Pish! ”
“Eh?”
“Pish!”
“Oh, pish. Yes, of course, pish. By
all means.”
“C’mon,” Blobbs said.
I trailed abjectly at his heels until he
led me into a small room off one of
the larger spaces.
“Loan collection,” he muttered in ex-
planation as we stopped. “Old Spinks’s
lot. There y’are. Wot y’ think o’ that?”
I regarded “that” carefully, expecting
to see on the title-plate
something like “Hash-
ish-smoker’s Dream” or
“Noon in a Sulphur
Mine.” Instead, 1 read
“Symphony in C Minor.”
That set me back a bit.
What could you say
about a picture that'
looked like a scrambled
egg slung at the wall by
the chef in a fit of ber-
serk fury? Then I re-
membered that Blobbs
was more noted for his
denunciations than his
praise. All right then, I’d
denounce; and if I
couldn’t do better than
“pish” I’d crawl from
the Art Gallery back to the city.
“Lousy!” I said heartily.
The sound of grinding teeth aroused
me from the pleasure with which I was
savoring my own terse summing up of
a work of art. I turned to find Blobbs
glaring at me balefully.
“Did you say lousy?”
He gave me no time to
reply, but snarled at me.
“That’s an artist’s re-
ward, is it? Pearls be-
fore swine, hey? A man
sweats ’is soul-case out
f’r nitwits t’ pretend t’
know all about it ’n’ say
lousy!”
Something told me
that my second flight
into the realms of higher
criticism ' had led me
astray again. While
Blobbs raved on I took another look at
the picture ; it had his signature in the
corner! Here was one of those moments
which call for adroit diplomacy, finesse
even. Stooping, I peered closely at the
canvas hanging next to the “Symphony
in C Minor.” I went over it closely,
my nose almost taking the paint off it.
At last I straightened up and turned to
“Pish!”
Blobbs, who by now had exhausted
himself into a foaming silence.-
“Well, I still say it’s rotten. Can’t
see anything to recommend it. Now”
(watching him closely I prepared for
the master stroke), “if you’d asked me
about this next thing—what’s the name
of it? ‘Symphony in C Minor’—well,
there’d only be one thing to say, stu-
pendous! But this thing” I was
stuck for a word, but only for a moment,
“Pish!”
“What?”
“Pish! ”
“Y* mean this one?”
He indicated the canvas scapegoat I
had selected.
“Yes,” 1 said. “Pish!” adding for
good measure, “Lousy!”
Blobbs stood back and eyed the second
picture through half-closed eyes.
“Well” he said.
“They should never have hung it next
to that thing ‘Symphony in C Minor,’ ”
I told him. “Unfair to the artist. Loses
too much by the comparison.”
“The composition,” Blobbs said
warmly, “is weak.”
“Decidedly.”
“No depth in the work.”
“No, no!”
“Color values all wrong.”
“Not a color value in it!”
By this time the old friendly feeling
between us was completely restored.
Blobbs stood off and did things with his
thumb. Then he shook his head sadly.
“Pretty lousy, I’m afraid.”
“Pish!” I said.
We then turned to the “Symphony.”
“Now this,” Blobbs began tentatively,
“is something quite different.”
Unable to convey by the ordinary
method of speech just how different it
was, I waved my arms vaguely to show
my enthusiasm. But Blobbs was obvi-
ously expecting a more vocal expression
of opinion.
“Magnificent composi-
tion,” I said at last.
“You think so?”
“Magnificent,” I re-
peated, and then, getting
into my stride, “Look at
the depth in it.”
“Yes, it’s got depth,”
he agreed. “And feeling,
I think.”
“Feeling, decidedly,” I
said heartily. “And get
on to those color values.”
“Yes, the color values
’re right. I think I c’n
say that without boastin’ meself.”

up to my eye and frowned at the pic-
ture, “Magnificent!”
“Y’ know,” Blobbs said, taking me lov-
ingly by the arm, “you’ve surprised me.
Some fellers seem f have a natural in-
stinct for art. Very few, mind y\ You’ve
got it. Yes,” he massaged my arm affec-
tionately, “you’ve got it all right.”
“Oh, well” 1 said.
It’s hard to
deny the posses-
sion of a natural
gift.
As “Symphony
in C Minor”
was the only
example of
Blobbs’s genius
in the gallery,
there wasn’t
much left for us
to look at. How-
ever, we glanced
condescendingly
at sundry can-
vases •on our
way out, and in
the course of
these swift re-
views I found I had the knack. It’s
easy, provided, of course, you have a
flair, as we critics call it, for this sort of
thing. If you strike a picture that is
reasonably recognisable as a painting of
a landscape, or a human being, or a heap
of bananas, just say “pish” or, if you are
writing a criticism, “mediocre” or “in
execrable taste.” On the other hand,
when confronted with something that,
to the uninitiated, might be anything from
a faithful representation of a dish of
cold Irish stew to the first efforts in color
of a child of six who has been blind
from birth, the word is “stupendous!”
After all, what’s the good of being a
critic if you’re going to like the same
things as everybody else?
By the time we emerged into the open
air once more I was perfect; I had
Blobbs’s word for it. In addition, I had
added a few new words to my vocabu-
lary: tone, restraint, verve, elan, vitality,
and had a working idea of when to slip
them in.
At the George we halted to see whether
....to see whether the quality of the
beer had declined.
the quality of the beer had declined since
our last call. Blobbs brought out his
tattered notebook, and prepared to make
another entry. He paused with the
pencil still hovering over the grimy
pages:
“The ‘Hen and Chickens,’ ” he said
with the air of one recollecting some-
thing of importance.
“The what?”
“The ‘Hen
and Chickens,’
i n c o r porating
'Australian
Crowers and
Cluckers.’ Poul-
try weekly.
Jonesy th’ edi-‘ j
tor was tellin’
me only yes’-
day he’d lost ’is |
art critic. The j
bloke got th’ !
offer of a bit o’
relief work.
Now here’s
somethin’. Y’r
a natural critic,
Woosh. How’d
y’ like t’ pull it
on? Hey?”
I make no secret of the fact that the
prospect appealed ; my newly-discovered
talent was itching for self-expression.
Even the disclosure made later by Jonesy
that the job was purely honorary did not
dampen my enthusiasm ; as my editor
said, there was the publicity to con-
sider.
Having a final one with Blobbs when
the negotiations were over, I noticed
hanging over the bar a calendar depict-
ing a very lifelike cow being all maternal
with an equally lifelike calf. I pointed it
out to Blobbs.
“Look at that,” I said.
“What about it?”
“Pish!” I exclaimed.
“Pish!” he echoed, adding sycophanti-
cally: “Lousy! ”
Well, there it was. Artists themselves
were accepting my pronouncements. I
was a full-fledged critic. I felt so good
about it that I told Blobbs to cancel
the score he was keeping in his
notebook.
Comedy of Papuan Officialdom:—
THE GIRL
FRIEND
BY G MUNRO TURNBULL.
“H oly Moses !”
he exclaimed admir-
ingly. '‘Mr. Jud-
son! You wicked
old”
LAZY one!” Lo-
I I gona howled. “O
woman without
shame!” And the lawyer-
cane came down.
Imari’s high - pitched
scream smothered her hus-
band’s snarling voice, and
the cane came up again.
Logona had authority over
his wife, and was asserting it in the only
way Papuan husbands understand.
Then a muscular hand closed over the
descending cane and wrenched it out of
Logona’s grip. Another hand jerked
down on Logona’s shoulder and flung
him forward. A blucher-booted foot
smote him.
“What you really need, my lad,”
Patrol-officer Freddie Bain informed him
dispassionately, “is a darned good sock
on the jaw. Come to me,” he told the
weeping girl in halting Motuan, “if he
tries anything funny again.”
Freddie Bain, pleasantly conscious of
a good deed well done, marched off in
the wake of his patrol, now hidden
behind a bend in the narrow jungle track.
“You prancing young idiot!” Tarrant,
the resident magistrate, commented
when, a day or two later, Bain reported
the incident. “If we don’t have trouble
with that bright lad it’ll be a miracle.
Shame a native in the eyes of his wife,
and he’s apt to do messy things to her
—with a club.”
BUT Tarrant was wrong. That after-
noon there sounded a discreet tap
on his office door, and a very self-pos-
sessed, very comely native girl entered,
closely followed by a bristling sergeant
of police.
“Taubada!” the sergeant fumed. “This
woman”--
“Be silent, bushman with the voice of
a cockatoo and feet like canoes!” Imari
interrupted with a queenly wave of the
hand.
A dreadful grimace con-
vulsed Sergeant Gorabi’s
brown face. He made a
choking noise in his
throat, but no words
came. The girl smiled
very sweetly at Tarrant. ,
“I have come, taubada,”
she announced, “because
he is my man, and very
wonderful to me.”
“Taubada,” Sergeant Gorabi inter-
vened in a terrible voice, “more better
I beat this woman with a stick.”
“He is very big, and very strong, tau-
bada,” Imari went on dreamily, “and
full of courage. Moreover, his eyes are
as blue beads, his face gold-flecked with
the kisses of the sun, his hair as the
blood of a young pig freshly killed.”
A startled look overspread Tarrant’s
face. There was but one large, blue-eyed,
freckle-faced, red-headed young man on
the station.
“Sergeant,” he ordered, “ask Mr. Bain
to step this way.”
The expression of polite inquiry was
wiped from Freddie Bain’s face when,
entering his senior’s room, he encoun-
tered Imari’s beaming smile.
“Your girl friend,” Tarrant informed
him. “And, believe me, young Bain,
you’re for it.”
Imari’s full red lips smiled widely over
her teeth ; her slender young body posed
and postured as though for the white
man’s favors ; her eyes shone provoca-
tively. Then, with a swift, graceful
movement she sank down at Freddie’s
feet, and clasped that bewildered young
man about the knees.
“Here, hold on!” he stuttered feebly
in English. “You can’t do that, you
know.”
Imari looked up at him with adoring
eyes. “I will cook your food, taubada,
and make your garden.” Her voice was
a caress. “And call you Faredi. My
love will be as the south-east wind”

Scott and Black add two famous names to
Vauxhall's already long list of owners...
Setting a new England-Australia record and win-
ning the Centenary Air Race in convincing style,
the D. H. Comet flown by Scott and Black forcibly
demonstrated to the world the worth and depen-
dability of English engineering and workmanship.
Even more impressive was the skill and endurance
displayed by the two pilots in what must have
been one of the most arduous tests to which men
have ever been submitted.
Vauxhall is honoured that such men have demon-
strated their faith in Vauxhall’s workmanship by
buying two of the latest models for their use here
and in England.
Vauxhall owners will be pleased that their own
judgment has been confirmed by men whose very
lives frequently depend on their ability to select
the best machines, and who have, therefore, by long
habit developed the discernment and technical
skill which enables them to choose, unerringly,
the best in air or land transport.

The flight of Scott and
Black to Australia will
remain one of the epic
stories of the air. Fifty -
two hours thirty-five
minutes after leaving
MUdenhall Aero-
drome, England, Scott
and Black were at
Darwin. Their aver-
age speed was nearly
175 miles an hour over
the distance of 9147
miles. This perform-
ance has demonstrated
that to British pilots

there is no possible
exploit in aviation that
they cannot try for

“Perhaps I’d better withdraw,” Tar-
rant politely out in. “The situation is not
without a certain —er —embarrassment.”
“Spare me days!” Freddie exclaimed
faintly. “Call her off, old chap. Sh-she’s
off her rocker.”
Tarrant placed the tips of his fingers
together, leaned back in a judicial atti-
tude and looked up thoughtfully at the
ceiling. “I need not remind you, young
Bain, of the code which governs the ser-
vice,” he said. “I’m not too old to
understand the first hot, mad ecstasy of
young love; but, really, my dear
chap”
But Freddie Bain, with a neigh of
righteous indignation, had torn himself
free and bolted.
Tarrant laughed, and was instantly
grave again.
“Take the woman to your house, ser-
geant,” he crisply ordered, “and let
Nuana, your wife, be responsible for her.
When her man comes to claim her, I will
make peace between them.”
Sergeant Gorabi had taken off his belt.
There was a wicked gleam in his eye.
“No rough stuff, sergeant!” Tarrant
snapped. “The lady is a guest of the
Gcivamani”
AT 6 p.m. Mr. Patrol-officer Freddie
Bain stepped into his bath. At one
minute past he was streaking across the
parade ground, his dressing-gown clasped
tightly about him. He took the Resi-
dency steps in two wild leaps and helped
himself to the drink which Tarrant had
just poured out for himself.
“She’s there!” he gasped. “In my
quarters, old chap—hiding in the bath-
room!”
An indescribably awful noise, a noise
like the midnight war-cries of an army
of fighting tomcats, shattered the silence.
Tarrant stepped to the verandah rail.
“Mrs. Gorabi and your girl friend are
having words,” he announced. He
paused. “Mrs. Gorabi has won,” he
went on as Imari, tearful and abusive by
turns, was bundled unceremoniously
back to the barracks. “The coast is clear
for the moment, but if you think an
armed guard and a padlock or two are
indicated, pass the word to the sergeant.”
There was a hunted look in Freddie
Bain’s eyes and his hand shook as he
steadied his nerves with another.
“Next time you discover a bloke en-
gaged in the lawful business of belting
his missus,” Tarrant admonished him,
“keep on walking, young feller.”
MEXT day a spick-and-span motor-
n launch, flying the blue ensign of the
Administration, tied up to the jetty. A
short man, beefy of figure, hard of face
and sly of eye, accompanied by a retinue
of native clerks, orderlies and servants,
descended on the station.
“I’m Judson,” he announced with
great importance.
Tarrant bowed his head and offered
him the hospitality of the Residency.
Tarrant was not taking any chances. For
Judson was one of the Great Ones, a
shining light in the constellation that
sheds its effulgence at headquarters. He
had, he informed Tarrant, been given a
roving commission which empowered
him to pounce unexpectedly upon un-
wary and unsuspecting district officers
in order to examine their books, check
their stores, inspect their work in all
its ramifications and expose to higher
authority any evidence of inefficiency,
slackness or default he might be able to
reveal.
“Economy is the watchword, my dear
Tarrant,” he brayed. “You fellows hid-
ing in the backblocks don’t seem to
realise that the good times are over. I’m
here to bring it home to you.” He
coughed importantly. “I’ll start at the
store —now. And, by the way, you’ll
understand why I prefer not to stay with
you at the Residency. My mission is
extremely— er—delicate.”
“As you like,” Tarrant returned, stiff-
lipped and a little red in the face. This
nasty bit of work would find nothing to
gloat over, he assured himself comfort-
ably, as he instructed Freddie Bain to
vacate his quarters and make them over
to the newcomer.
Freddie, as official keeper of the
records, ushered Mr. Judson into the
store with a fine show of ceremony.
“There they are, sir,” he declaimed,
“all in a row. Dinky mats of rice, bulg-
ing bags of”
“I’m not being funny, young man,”
Judson sourly interrupted him. “And
don’t exercise your peculiar brand of
humor on me.”
“Here we have the stock book,”
Freddie went on, quite unabashed. “Re-
ceipts on the left; issues on the right.
Debit and credit, all present and cor-
rect and according to the book of rules.”
“And not written up for the last two
weeks, I perceive,” Judson commented
with great satisfaction.
Freddie reflectively scratched an ear.
Then he laughed boisterously/ “You’ve
got me there,” he conceded. “But that’s
all right. When you barged in this
morning, you practically caught me in
the act of filling in the blank spaces and
totting ’em up. Give me a couple of
minutes with the old pen, and” -
“Yes,” Mr. Judson cut in meaningly.
“They all say that.”
As Freddie stated later to the R.M.,
you can’t make friends with a bloke like
that.
AN unwonted quietude brooded over
the station during the remainder of
that day. There were times when Tarrant
lost his temper with Mr. Judson, which
was extremely foolish. There came a
time when he threatened to pull Mr.
Judson’s nose, which was worse.
Mr. Judson went about his task of
gingering up the service, making cluck-
ing noises in his throat and voluminous
notes in a little book. On the whole, he
seemed very pleased with himself.
It was long after sunset when he
waddled up the Residency steps and
lowered himself into Tarrant’s only com-
fortable chair. He blew his nose ex-
plosively and produced his notebook.
“I regret to say, Tarrant,” he stated,
“that I have discovered evidence of
lamentable irregularities in your con-
duct of official business. Of course, I
don’t for a moment impute fraudulent
intention”
“You’d better not,” Tarrant grimly
cautioned him.
“ —nevertheless, you’ll find it diffi-
cult —very difficult indeed —to show
cause why you should not be judged
guilty of such laxity”
“Cut the cackle, man!” Hot resent-
ment was burning in Tarrant, hardening
the line of his jaw, narrowing his eyes.
“What’s biting you?”
“You’re short in your stores, Tarrant.
Rice —half a ton and more; trade to-
bacco —hundreds of sticks; tinned meat
—half a dozen cases. Every item, Tar-
rant —soap, sugar, flour—short, Tarrant,
short! ”
Tarrant stopped him sharply. “It is
my one invariable rule,” he declared
softly, “never to discuss matters of offi-
cial moment, nor allow them to be dis-
cussed, in my house. At the office —to-
morrow—l shall be at your service.”
For a man whose career was about
to suffer a severe blow, he seemed curi-
ously at ease as he bowed the fuming
Mr. Judson off the premises.
dawn —chill and heavy-scented.
Wisps of white mist rising from the
swamps; beyond, the unstirring jungle,
a dark evergreen mass splashed with
color. And the terrible steel-blue moun-
tains of Papua towering behind, clean-
cut against a pink streak that heralded
the rising sun.
A voice—harsh, rasping, thick with
fury—raised itself in the compound.
“O shameless one! O wanton! O
plaything of many men!”
The voice broke into a torrent of un-
intelligible abuse. There was a screech
of defiance, a howl of rage—loud, deadly
sounds of strife that brought Tarrant
and his assistant out of their stretchers
like shots from a gun.
On the sward in front of Freddie
Bain’s quarters pranced a monstrous and
terrible apparition, a plumed and painted
savage, executing a war-dance and
screaming dreadful threats of vengeance.
Mr. Judson was at the bedroom door, his
mouth agape, his eyes boggled, cording
his dressing-gown against the chill of
the dawn. Imari, a look of intense loath-
ing on her face, was spitting out things
which would have astonished Mr. Jud-
son if he had understood them. Sergeant
Gorabi made an interested fourth.
Imari smiled guilelessly at sight of
Freddie Bain.
“Taubada,” she breathed, “why is this
man of fat”
“Shut up, woman!” Sergeant Gorabi
gripped her elbow and scowled very
fiercely.
A weak grin flickered over Mr. Jud-
son’s features when the others came up.
Freddie Bain took in the situation and
dug Tarrant joyously in the ribs.
“Holy Moses!” he exclaimed admir-
ingly. “Mr. Judson! You wicked
old”
Mr. Judson checked him with an an-
nihilating gesture. He turned confidently
to Tarrant. Tarrant’s face was stony,
A look of bewilderment, of apprehen-
sion, leapt into Mr. Judson’s eyes, and
he went a little white about the gills.
The cloistered seclusion of his Port
Moresby office was very visible to him
then.
“Really, Tarrant,” he said in a voice
smaller than its wont. “This is utterly
ridiculous. The wretched creature
sneaked into my room. Actually insinu-
ated herself”
“Quite,” Freddie Bain jeered rudely.
“They all say that.”
Mr. Judson whirled upon him, gnash-
ing his teeth, frothing at the mouth.
“You damned insolent young pup!” he
raved. “How dare you suggest that”
“That’ll do,” Tarrant snapped. “You
refused the hospitality of my roof yester-
day, Mr. Judson. I’m obliged to you,
sir.” He turned on his heel. “Disarm
that man, Mr. Bain,” he ordered, point-
ing to Logona. “Take him away; and
his wife also.”
Logona was led away by the ear.
Imari, who seemed reluctant to go,
yielded only to the sergeant’s muttered
threats.
Tarrant set his gaze determinedly on
the middle distance.
“Gad! ” he exclaimed. “Wenching!
On my station! Of all.the confounded
nerve! ”
It was not until he regained the Resi-
dency that he permitted himself the re-
laxation of a grin.
PUNCTUALLY on the stroke of nine
Sergeant Gorabi ushered Mr. Judson
into Tarrant’s office. Judson assumed a
pose of great dignity as he seated him-
self.
“Here is the report which it will be
my duty—my painful duty—to transmit
to your immediate superior,” he opened
pompously. He coughed. “You may
acquaint yourself with its contents, Tar-
rant. I believe in playing fair.”
“You surprise me,” Tarrant mur-
mured.
He took the document and read,
frowning. It was all as he had sur-
mised. Minor irregularities magnified
into major faults; insignificant omis-
sions of routine made gross derelictions
of duty; half truths more damaging
than lies —all recorded against him on
paper with an expert adroitness and a
genius for complications which are the
peculiar gifts of the Judsons of Pacific
officialdom. As for the chief indict-

In this valuable Book is the story of

cprays, injections, smokes, etc.
End Bed-Time Fears
In almost every case the treatment
outlined in this Free Book will enable
the sufferer in a few days to control
the attacks and sleep without suffer-
ing. This is important, as many suf-
ferers dread to lie down for fear of the
choking, gasping paroxysms of Asthma
or the coughing spells of Bronchitis.
Climatic changes excite Asthma and
Bronchitis, but some sufferers are
quite as bad in Summer as in Winter.
Therefore, NOW is the time for im-
mediate treatment.
New Hope for Sufferers
The peace of mind brought about by
the relief from the dread of attacks
means new LIFE to the Asthma and
Bronchitis sufferer. No matter where

lifetime, tried everything you could
hear of without getting relief, even if
you are utterly discouraged, do not
give up hope. Send for this wonder-
ful book. It will especially appeal to
those apparently hopeless cases where
drugs, sprays, injections, etc., have
failed to give lasting relief.

Name
ment, the matter of the missing stores, it
occupied three folios and was full of meat,
Tarrant folded the papers carefully
and handed them back. “My advice to
you is to light your pipe with ’em.”
He paused, smiling. Mr. Judson seemed
visibly ill at ease. “You understand, of
course, that if the woman s husband
lodges a complaint, it will be my duty to
afford 0 to Cla be n °nTOlvld 'in a fkst-rate
scandal, can you? Or can you?”
Mr. Judson sank back in his chair as
if his backbone had suddenly snapped,
“I—I” he stammered feebly. “It’s a
ghastly mistake, Tarrant. Y-you know
it’s a—a misunderstanding.”
Tarrant smiled reminiscently. “I say,
you did look fat and flurried, didn’t
you? And what if you are the victim
of a misunderstanding? Who’s to prove
it—if Logona wants a piece of your
hide? And what will people think?
What will they say ?” He grinned with
huge cheerfulness. “No two ways about
it, little man, you’re for it.”
With a desperate effort Mr. Judson
pulled himself together. “If the fellow
makes complaint, I believe you said,
Tarrant. „
Tarrant grinned again. Quite, he
agreed. “I see we understand each other
perfectly.” He laughed genially. “Your
move, Judson.”
For answer Mr. Judson held up his
damning report and tore it into little
pieces.
“Lcgona will hold his tongue,” Tar-
rant stated.
HIS manner changed ; his voice changed,
became harsh, grating.
“You’re an offence, Judson,” he de-
clared. “You’re a shocking nuisance and
a temptation to everybody who comes
within hoofing distance of you. And you
think you’ve made a bargain with me!
The quid pro quo of your disgusting
creed. You verminous little beast!
Every ounce of the Crown’s property you
accuse me of pinching you’ll find under
lock and key in No. 3 cell—made up
into 401 b. packs for the mountain patrol
we intend to make as soon as we’ve rid
ourselves of your appalling company.
Now, hop it!”
Mr. Judson opened his mouth, shut it,
and stood up. He retired slowly with
what he hoped was polite but chilly dig-
nity. A pleasant baritone voice floated
from the inner room:
“ Isn’t she neat; isn’t she sweet ?
An eyeful, deli’ful,
A pleasure to meet”
Mr. Judson’s exit became a panic
flight.
Tells of a Violent Revenge:-
ROADMAKERS' RATIONS
By J.H.M. A bbott
PETER GILES came to this country
a great many years ago. For em-
bezzlement. The roads he made go
south and west and north.
Peter had been a clerk in a London
bank of a modest sort whose destinies
were controlled by a pious and good
man who was a very prominent member
of the Society of Friends, and it was
solely owing to this latter fact that Peter
came to Port Jackson at all. It was
usual to be hanged in those days for
what Peter had done, but Mr. Abraham
Frey, in accordance with the benevolent
principles of his sect, was averse from
the shedding of blood, and took great
pains to ensure that he would not carry
upon his conscience the burden of Peter’s
untimely demise at the end of a rope
near the corner of Holborn and the Old
Bailey, in front of Newgate Prison and
opposite to the tower of St. Sepulchre’s
Church.
Very lucky that was for Peter, and
very lucky, too, for New South Wales.
Men like Peter Gil£s did not come here
every day in 1808. Consider the roads
he made.
WHEN Peter looked about him he saw
one thing clearly and unmistakably
—that the salvation of Peter Giles lay alto-
gether in his own hands. Wherefore he
made up his mind —there in the Lumber
Yard, where they had set him adzing
great baulks of timber that had been
floated down from the Lane Cove River
—that never would he miss an oppor-
tunity of placating Authority or of
climbing out of the ruck of convictdom
on to some shelf of place and security.
So he became eminently alert in the pur-
suit of the Main Chance, and never after-
wards gave leave to any sentiment to
lure him away from the path that he had
chosen.
His first opportunity came to him for-
tuitously. Certain of his companions in
misfortune had made the discovery that
the master of an American whaling ship
lying in the harbor stood in need of a
considerable quantity of sawn timber,
and was not disposed to inquire too
closely where it might come from so
long as he got it at his own price—which
was not a high one, but represented
wealth to hungry devils who were alto-
gether wealthless.
So, plank by plank and joist by joist,
much hardwood found its way by night
over the Rocks down on to the shores
of Cockle Bay, where it was taken into
Captain Tallisker’s boats and ferried to
the Julia B, lying in the stream off Dawes
Battery. Iron spikes and nails i ike wise
commanded a market, and drums of oil
and little kegs of whitelead, and many
odds and ends of a sort that were easily
picked up in the Yard.
Peter, having discovered what was
going on, one evening informed the
Superintendent of the Yard, Mr Anthony
Macmaster.
“An’ f’r why, me man, ha’ ye blown
th’ gaff upon these others?” inquired
Tony Macmaster after he had duly
noted down names and particulars. “Ha’
they worked crooked wi’ ye* or what?”
“An’ called me a Irish crawler.
An’ got me flogged... .1 ain’t for-
got. No — an’ you won’t forget,
either !”
“Oh, no, sir,” said Peter Giles ear-
nestly; “ ’tis not that. 1 have done wrong
myself, and so am here in this unfor-
tunate situation of a prisoner. I have
made my mind up always to do right in
the future, God assisting me —and ’tis
but proper I should interfere when I see
Government being robbed in so scan-
dalous a fashion. ’Tis what my con-
science tells me I should do. Sir, I am
striving to redeem the past.”
“Ah! ” remarked Mr. Macmaster drily.
So they took three of Peter’s com-
rades and hanged them high on Gallows
Hill, and three they flogged with 500
lashes and sent to the Coal River, and
the seventh committed suicide in the
gaol before they could reason with him
at all.
Peter they rewarded by making him
an overseer in one of the road-gangs,
where he soon made his mark as a zeal-
ous and painstaking minor official of the
convict class. He became a constable
when Governor Macquarie reorganised
the police force of Sydney and made
Mr. D’Arcy Wentworth Superintendent,
and before long he was clerk to that
gentleman, and well and justly renowned
for his sobriety, diligence in the dis-
charge of his duties, humble and correct
demeanor to his superiors, and notable
religious zeal in the uplifting of his fel-
lows. It was Macquarie, ever anxious
to encourage reformation and reward
merit, who gave him his conditional
pardon, and it was Sir Thomas Brisbane
who made him superintendent of all
the gangs upon the Western-road.
ON a summer afternoon in 1830 Mr.
Peter Giles came riding on horse-
back across Emu Plains, on his return
to his Blue Mountain headquarters at
Mount Victoria, after a visit to Sydney,
and called at the stockade to see the
Commandant of the convict agricultural
settlement that used to be there located.
Presently he was shown into Captain
Parkman’s office.
Australia had done wonders, physi-
cally, for Mr. Peter Giles. He was a
very different person now from the
anaemic, sickly Cockney bank clerk of
a quarter of a century before. The
round-shouldered, nervous, hesitating, de-
jected young man was now a square-
shouldered, burly, assertive person, red-
faced and healthy. He bore himself as
one who was conscious of his own value
in the scheme of things, and he was well
though quietly dressed, his beaver top-
hat, black silk stock, closely-buttoned
blue tail-coat, buckskin breeches and
Wellington boots in keeping with the
quiet dignity of his clean-shaven features
and the closely-cropped mutton-chop
whiskers that decorated each jawbone.
Captain Parkman looked up from his
writing as Mr. Giles’s shadow darkened
the doorway.
“Ah —back again, Mr. Giles?” he said.
“ ‘Home to our mountains,’ eh? Pray
be seated, sir. I trust you have enjoyed
your holiday. And the Major—how is
the Major? When may we hope to see
him this way again? Take a chair —do!”
The Superintendent of Labor on the
improved road that was making across
the mountains seated himself, and crossed
one leg over the other, as he replied to
the Commandant’s greeting.
“Yes, sir—yes, Captain Parkman—•
back again. I thank you kindly—l have
found the few days’ change to the sea-
side most beneficial to my health, sir—
most refreshing. Major Mitchell? Ah—
very well, indeed, I thank you, sir. I saw
much of the Surveyor-General—in fact,
he had me at his office for the greater
part of every day whilst I was in Syd-
ney. A man of great energy, sir—abound-
ing energy. He talks of inspecting the
road during the coming month. Well,
well—we will be ready for him. I am
glad to say the gangs have been working
very well—very well indeed. My cele-
brated system has proved itself success-
ful, sir. Eminently successful.”
“Ah —you have hit upon some plan
for making the beggars work, have you,
Mr. Giles? Pray, what is it? I declare
my fellows are the most incorrigibly idle
pack of hounds a man was ever afflicted
with. How do you do it, pray?”
Mr. Giles smiled complacently.
“The rations, Captain Parkman —the
rations. I find ’tis easier to appeal to
them through their stomachs rather than
through their hides. Much easier. You
see, I was a prisoner myself once. So I
know. My system is one of regulating
their food supply in accordance with the
reports I receive from my overseers re-
garding the work of each individual. It
answers admirably, I assure you.”
“Yes, yes—l see. You reward good
work with some little privileges, I pre-
sume. Something extra for the fellows
who do their best —is that it?”
Mr. Giles laughed indulgently.

“Oh dear, no,” he chuckled. “Quite
the reverse. If my fellows don’t work,
they don’t eat. That’s the idea. The
usual ration for all hands. And a system
of marks. If a man gets a bad mark, he
has some of his tucker taken away from
him. Two bad marks in a day, for in--
stance, will only give him half his usual
allowance in the evening. I have these
little accounts adjusted each night at sun-
set, when the gangs knock off work and
are mustered into the stockade for the
night. Sometimes it happens that an
idle, fellow has nothing at all coming to
him in the evening. Goes to bed hun-
gry, and thinks the matter over on an
empty stomach. ..He is generally all dili-
gence the next day. ’Tis an idea that
works well in practice—very well indeed.”
“Oh, excellent. I must give it a trial
here. But we are at a little disadvan-
tage, you know. Too close to headquar-
ters, perhaps, for experimenting with the
regulations. Busybodies, you under-
stand. ( My chaplain, for example. A per-
fect pest of. a fellow, confound him.
Thinks the prisoners’ bodies are as much
his concern as their souls. A most per-
nicious idea. But, pray, Mr. Giles,
what can I do for you? I must close
my office and get round the farm
directly. ' Is there any little service at
my command? Only too happy to
render it, sir, if so.”
MR. GILES sat upright, and then
leaned a little forward, as he asked
his question. He spoke with something
of apprehension. in his voice.
; “I was wondering, sir, whether you
could spare me a couple of soldiers as
an escort to the stockade at Springwood,
where I wish to make to-night. They told
me at South Creek that Jack Donahoe
had been seen in the district. Is that
correct, sir? I should not care to be
caught by that gentleman. I had him
under me on the road to the New Coun-
try—on the Goulburn-road. He is a
vindictive rascal. I had rather not en-
counter him alone.”
Captain Parkman was too polite to say
what he thought of this request. He
hesitated a moment before replying. Gad,
he thought to himself, how a lag hates a
lag! And how they fear one another!
“Well, it is a fact that he’s been seen
between here and Windsor, but I fancy
he’s gone southward again. However, I
think I can spare you a couple of pri-
vates to see you through the danger
zone. Though I don’t suppose you’ll
come across him. Two’ll be enough,
eh? The mere sight of a redcoat often
acts as a deterrent to these gentry. This
fellow Donahoe’s a nasty customer from
all accounts—a thoroughpaced villain.
D’ye know, the convicts make quite a
hero of the bla’guard! They’ve even
got a song about him—‘Bold Jack Dona-
hoe.’ They seem to regard him as a
sort of Robin Hood. Yes—perhaps, from
your position, you do stand in need of
some special protection. I’ll go over to
the barracks with you, and pick out a
couple of good men.”
AN Lapstone Hill, as they trudged
v sweatfully up the road behind Mr.
Giles’s horse through the shadows of late
afternoon, Private Timothy O’Brien
voiced his disapproval of the situation
to Private Owen Morgan.
“Luk at th’ lag,” he grumbled.
“Ye’d think ’twas th’ Lift’nant-Gov’nor,
no less, a-trav’lin wid an arrumed escoort
along the —— road. An’ what is he, I
ask ye, Taffy? Why, nothin’ but a d d
ould hand like all th’ rest o’ thim. Th’
jumped-up monkey! ’Tis but a
poor supper we’ll get out o’ Starvation
Pete this night at Springwood. I’ll lay
me whole kit to y’r ramrod there ain’t
no rum issue for us two to-night.”
“’Tis th’ devil’s shame, it iss, Tim,”
agreed Mr. Morgan, loosening his leather
stock, “for to put us to such work. In-
deed, yes! But I haf an idea in my head.
So soon as th’ sun goes down I’ll sprain
my ankle, and not a step further will I
be able for to trafel. He’ll must needs,
leave you for to look after me, and back
we’ll go to camp. A couple of days
rest’ll do me no harm. See? ’Tis not
so fery bad of an idea, iss it now?
Indeed, no!” - -
“Owen,” responded Mr. O’Brien with ;
enthusiasm —“’tis th’ foine headpiece
ye’ve got at th’ top o’ y’r carcass. Tis a
schame indeed!”
And so, as the tree-lined crest of the
mountain silhouetted itself sharply against
the orange-and-yellow afterglow of sun-
set, Mr. Giles was halted by a shout
from the soldiers who had been toiling
up the slope behind him. He turned in
the saddle and saw one of his escort
leaning upon his elbow, stretched out in
the dust of the highway, whilst the other
stood over him waving his arms and
yelling for assistance. Mr. Giles rode
slowly back to them, and was received
with lamentation, apology and sorrow by
the eloquent Private O’Brien.
“Sure, th’ pore fellie’s twisted his fut
under him, y’r honor, an’ can’t walk
another step. ’Tis bad luck entirely, so
it is. Howiver’ll I get him back to camp
I dunno. Glory be, was iver such bad
luck! Will y’r honor stay wid him now,
whiles I go back for a cart for to get
him down the hill? Or will y’r honor
ride on to Springwood, whiles I make
shift for to hump him back to Emu
Plains on th’ back av me? Mebbe” —
he hesitated artistically—“mebbe, if y’r
honor’s a-fearin’ for th’ bushrangers, ye’d
come back wid us? We cud put pore
Morgan here on th’ horse an’ carry him
back foine an’.aisy. Wud that plaise y’r
honor’s silf?” ' '
“No, no” —Mr. Giles shook his head—
“l must get to Springwood this evening.
Do you stay with him, my man —or carry
him down. I suppose I must chance
meeting with Donahoe. But I must get on.”
“Aw, ’tis Jack Donahoe y’r honor’s on
th’ lukout for, is it? Well thin, y’r honor,
ye may rist easy in y’r moind. Th’ bould
Jack’s away out o’ th’ disthric’, so he is.”
“Ah, well—l’m glad to hear it. Any-
how, I’ve my pistols. I must go on. Do
what you can to help your comrade back
to Emu Plains. Good night to you both.”
He turned his horse’s head up the hill
and rode away into the deepening
shadows.
“Yis, me ould lag, an’ I hope
Johnny catches ye. Ye’d think th’- swine
might ha’ passed us th’ price av a pint
o’ rum, wouldn t ye now, Owen?”
“Him!” cursed Private Morgan vin-
dictively. “The ! Him!”
HALF a mile further on the bold Jack
Donahoe, with his mate Walmsey,
intercepted Mr. Peter Giles, and, when
he recognised who it was their muskets
covered, greeted him with great oppro-
brium., It was just light enough for the
Superintendent - to‘ note the look of hate
and fury 1 in the blue eyes of the fair-
headed little Irishman who ordered him
off his horse.
“Holy Virgin, Walmsey—d’ye see who
’tis? ’Tis Starvation Pete hisself. Was
there iver such a piece o’ luck, I ask ye?
Ye fat rascal, ye I’ve a mind
for to blow y’r brains out, d n ye!
D’ye remimber them free days down be
th’ stone quarry, ye , whin ye done
me out o’ me rations an’ jeered at me?
An’ called me a Irish crawler. An’ got
me flogged. By God, / do. I ain’t for-
got. No —an’ by hell you won’t
forget it either—be th’ time th’ night’s
done. No, ye won’t, so ye won’t. I’ll
go bail on that! Tie his hands behind
him, Walmsey. I want to think what’ll
I do wid th’ . Shootin’s too good
an’ easy for him! We’ll do better . than
that wid him.”
So, whilst Mr. Peter Giles stood in the
black shadow of the trees by the road-
side with tightly-bound wrists, sick in
his stomach and possessed of terrors that
made him sweat a cold perspiration,
the bold Jack Donahoe and his mate
debated in low tones the manner of his
torture.
He had no doubt as to what they were
discussing. Donahoe was noted for the
more than devilish ingenuity with which
he was wont to inflict torment upon
those unlucky enough to fall into his
hands who had offended or injured him
whilst he had been in bondage. He
shivered.
Presently he heard Donahoe laugh in
the darkness. The bushranger came
across to him.
“D’ye know what we’re a-goin’ to do
wid ye, Starvation Pete? Ye’ve heard
tell o’ the antbed cure, ain’t ye now?
Well—that’s it.”
“Ah—my God! Not that, Donahoe.
For the love of heaven, not that. Oh,
my God —anything but that,” screamed
Mr. Peter Giles. •_
“Yes —just ‘that, 'ye —— carrion.
There’s a fine big red-ants’ nest close by
here where’d ye’d spend a comfortable
night; - They’re ,good : workers, them little
fellies-—an’ they won’t go widout their
rations! Not thim! Ye’ll have a cowld
night, naked on the antheap—but it’ll
be comfortable to what ye’ll have after
sunrise. They’ll pull every bit of flesh
off of y’r bones, ye , wid red-hot
little pincers, so they will. An’ ye’ll be
mindin’ all the time how ye treated pore
Jack Donahoe at th’ stone quarry on
th’ Southern-road. Ye won’t deny these
here roadmakers their rations—that ye
won’t, ye hound o’ hell!”
TWO convicts, tramping down the road
an hour after sundown, came upon
the naked, writhing form of the Principal
Superintendent of the construction of
Sir Thomas Mitchell’s new highway
across the Blue Mountains, spread-eagled
on his back across a red-ants’ nest. By
wrists and ankles he was secured to
deeply-driven pegs. All over his squirm-
ing carcass the busy little workers indus-
triously ,drew fresh rations. The silent
forest'echoed, with his ravings. •
“Gawd, : Jimmy,” whispered one of the
men as they stood behind him, “d’ye'
see who ’tis? ’Tis Starvation Pete!”
“Dammit,” growled the other bitterly,
“I wish we hadn’t found th’ cow! We’ll
have to untie him. The rest o’ .th’ gang’ll
be along soon, an’ th’ sojers. But we’ll
give him a few minutes longer.” .
