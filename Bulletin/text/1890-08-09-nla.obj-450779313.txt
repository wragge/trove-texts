EVERY HOUSEHOLD—e specially where
there are young cnildrcn—should he provided
with Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the prompt use of
which lias saved innumerable lives. Its effect
is immediate and certain. It stops coughing, pro-
motes expectoration, and soothes the irritated
membrane. The most famous and successful
Cough” Cure
in the world, it has no equal as a remedy for
asthma, bronchitis, inflamed tonsils, loss of
voice, whooping-cough, croup, and the sudden
pulmonary complaints to which children are
liable. Taken in the early stages of consump-
tion, it often cures that disease and always
checks its progress; and even at a later period
in the malady, it relieves the distressing cough
and induces needful repose. A safe, palatable,
and economical medicine, Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral should be always at hand in case of an nit
foreseen and sudden emergency.

ANY
WHO IS
WEAK
fgf
Nervous & Debilitated ■
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINE WAY'S success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts : — lst. That every case treated,
• even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and relined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
:an recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINEWAY, who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed, ft
makes no difference zvhat you have taken, or
'who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION : -Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting; fullness of blood in the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do yon suffer irom Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject ? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Arc you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulncss, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can bo placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour?
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £\, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter zvhat your
complaint may be, call or zvrite — l 'will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay ! My vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-
TATIONS FREE. Medicines sent secure
from observation to any part of Australasia.

(REGISTERED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF NEW SOUTH WALES),
Law House Suroeon to the Great Northern Hospital, Caledonian Road, London,
SPECIALIST in the. Treatment of Diseases of the
Reproductive Organs and Nervous Complaints.
Du. PERKY was induced to publicly advertise himself as a
Specialist in this branch of the profession in consequence of the number
of persons suffering from diseases of this nature remaining nncured : and
this is not surprising, when it is remembered, in consequence of the
general dislike of the profession to undertake these cases, the public
health has suffered, localise the majority of Persons advertising to treat
these diseases, and calling themselves Doctors, Professors, etc.,
Are Neither the One nor the Other,
and exist chiefly because DI'LV QFALIFI KD MEDICAL PRAC-
TITIONERS have not occupied the field.
Patients can, therefore, readily see the advantage of being treated
bv a practitioner who has gone through a thorough Medical, Surgical and
\ natomieal Training in the best hospitals : and the Doctor argues that,
although it may be considered contrary to antiquated medical etiquette
to so advertise, yet lie is promoting the usefulness AND THK iuonitv of
the profession more by searching out and relieving this class of disease
Ilian by leaving them severely alone to the care of men who, however good
their intentions, have neither the opportunities or advantages of a regular
medical training to become acquainted with the best methods of treat ing
these complex forms of disease.

Party Government.
Ifc is one of the proudest boasts of the average
Briton that the constitution of his beloved
country was not built on any detinite plan,
but that it “ grew up ” in a gradual, uncer-
tain sort of way according to the require-
ments of the nation. It grew somewhat lop-
sided, too, and became shapeless and patchy
in its formation, but the Briton regards it
with a feeling of blissful contentment because
of its growth. That lamented person, the
recent Prince Consort, after a vain effort to
discover how his adopted country was
governed or who governed it, once offered
the remark that “ representative institutions
were-upon their trial,’ and whether he made
this observation all by himself or whether lie
hired somebody to assist him, it was a really
brilliant suggestion for a prince to make.
And it deserves to be kept in remembrance,
for it was the only original expression he is
ever known to have made use of, and when
he died at his post a little while later, with
income in his right hand, he was still
trying to fathom the chaos of party politics,
md still wondering why he had never seen
inything resembling the British Constitution
before.
* # *
The first great principle of government in
all countries which have adopted the British
system is that there must be always some-
body on hand ready to rise and contradict
the Cabinet, and that the Cabinet and its
supporters must bo prepared at any hour of
the night or day to state in general terms
that the other party is a liar. This process
of incessant contradiction is understood to
be essential to purity of administration, and
when there is a falling-off in the violence of
the contradiction it is felt, that representative
institutions are on the decline. in other
words, it is universally recognised that the
Government is of a low character, and that
unless somebody is constantly present to ex-
pose its villainy the country will generally go
to wreck. And after due consideration of
government in general, there seems to be
sufficient reason for this assumption in almost
every case. Moreover, when the Govern-
ment is ejected from office and the other
party takes its place, the same precautions
are invariably regarded as essential, from
which it would appear that the other party
is likewise a despicable object, and not to be
trusted. A comprehensive glance at the
history of the other party in general affords
good reason for a belief in the soundness of
this theor' likewise : and consequently
party politics may be briefly defined as a
system by which two low-minded organisa-
tions are hired to expound each other’s
infamy for the public benefit, and to prove
to the country that the other side is an asso-
ciation of grasping brigands, to whom honour
.is a myth, and ordinary decency a delusion,
and truth an old forgotten tiling of no ac-
count. And as a rule both sides prove this
fact with such vigour and success that it
becomes a matter of surprise that the nation
does not immediately discharge both of them
and start afresh on some basis which will
oiler less scope for an exhibition of all the
bad qualities of humanity.
* * *
It is one of the gilded fictions of this cum-
brous system that each faction is contending
for a principle, but even admitting this
obvious lie to be true it goes rather to prove
the. awful scarcity of principle than to
demonstrate its actual existence. For in the
majority of representative assemblies two
factions and a few political outcasts make up
the entire total, and even granting that each
body has a principle of some kind to contend
for,, t wo of these articles divided among, say,
130 members is a woefully short allowance.
Yet, considering the unanimity with which
the party in office hangs on to its salary, and
the equal- unanimity with which tire party
out of office demands that salary, it is
reasonable to assume that each side has only
one fixed principle amongst it, or else that it
has sunk all the rest of its convictions lest
they should result in disorganisation, and dis-
organisation should lead to general over-
throw. Or again, it may be that neither, of
the opposing leagues has any conviction at
all except that it wants £l5OO a year and
any other pickings that may come in its way,
and in most cases, no doubt, this is the more
correct explanation of the two. A politician
with convictions of any kind is necessarily a
failure, for if his opponents only remain long
enough in office they are almost certain,
sooner or later, to borrow his principle from
him, and then it is his duty as a party poli-
tician to curse them for doing what he pre-
viously cursed them for leaving undone, and
to prove their villainy in accomplishing what
he formerly proved them to be inhuman
ruffians for not accomplishing, and if his
moral sentiments stand in the way it is time
for him to retire and make room for some
person of greater scone and fluency.
* * *
The reason why few Governments survive
a general election is that the country is
weary of both sides alike, and w r ould gladly
consign the whole race of party politicians
to oblivion if it only knew how to do it, or
how to get anything else instead. But -the
system of Government by Contradiction has
become so deeply-rooted that the nation
finds it difficult to conceive the possibility of
any other form of administration. It is the
recognised axiom in all Anglo-Saxon com-
munities that the Legislature must neces-
sarily consist of two factions, and that each
should assert that everything the other does
is wrong ; and the fact that each faction
generally proves the truth of its assertion is
only a trivial aggravation of the evil. The
choice does not even lie between the devil
the country knows and the devil it does not
know ; as a rule it is intimately acquainted
with both devils,juyid hates the pair of them.
But as the mental and moral wretchedness
of the party in office is the more conspicuous
of the two, the country gradually gets up a
species of melancholy enthusiasm on behalf
of the other side.' It would gladly heave a
brick at both of them, but being driven to a
choice it votes for the,person who seems to
deserve the smaller brick. The whole
system of party requires that every man
should sink his principles—if he ever had
any- and his honour, supposing him to be
furnished with such an article, for the sake
of “dishing” the man opposite, and a poli-
tician being thus necessarily a man without
any honour or principle worth mentioning, a
constituency must either choose between
two unprincipled individuals, or return
somebody who will belong to neither party,
and who will consequently be neglected by
botli when the loaves and fishes are going
round.
w # *
A few other disadvantages of more or less
importance attach themselves to this un-
wieldy system of administration. The leader
who has scrambled into power, either be-
cause he is the less of two grievous evils, or
because the other evil looks larger for the
moment through having been placed too
conspicuously before tiro naked eye, has the
sole power of selecting his colleagues, and he
may fill the highest offices of the State with
publicans, usurers, and drunkards at his
pleasure. The party has either to accept or
reject this gang in their entirety, and as
rejection means handing over the reins of
authority to the hated individuals opposite,
they generally take the lot. If the House
wishes to rid itself by force of the most con-
spicuous imbecile in the Ministry it can only
do it by Rejecting the whole Cabinet, and
giving the leader on the other side an oppor-
tunity to form a Ministry of his own, with
some equally irremoveable human incubus
in it. Consequently the final result is a
strangely, anomalous one. The Parliament
itself° is chosen by the people, generally
because they don t know any better. Ihe
Premier is selected within the House, not by
a direct vote, but generally by accident, or
because his voice is so loud and vociferous
that it drowns all objection. And finally the
Premier’s colleagues are appointed without
any a ppeal either to the House or the people,
sometimes, it may be, because they have had
financial dealings with their chief, sometimes
because their muddle-headedness is a guar-
antee that they will not interfere with un-
called-for suggestions, and sometimes for no
earthly reason that either they or anyone
else can ever discover. The spectacle of Sir
p,i;van <VLoohlrn as Premier of Victoria
without a following, and of Six’ Patrick Jen- .
kings as the newly-elevated leader of an
Assembly that had hardly recognised his
existence, are fair samples of the possibi-
lities of the modern Parliamentary system.
# * *
The peaceful little Republic of Switzerland
is probably the only State in existence which
has learned how to run a constitutional
government utterly irrespective of party
considerations. In that plain, undignified
commonwealth the Premier is elected by a
direct vote of the Assembly, and thus those
strange eventualities, by which a tenth-rate
politician may rise to sudden eminence
because he moved a vote of censure which
met with unexpected success, and fall again
as suddenly when he has reduced the affairs
of the nation to chaos, have no place in Swiss
politics. His colleagues are elected in a
similar manner, and, consequently, the
Premier is a man without any personal
following, for the average politician only
follows someone who has offices to distribute.
The Cabinet holds office for three years, and
it is never defeated in the ordinary accepta-
tion of the term, because the House has
never pledged itself to follow its dictates.
Its chief duty is to transact all necessary
routine business and to attend to the details
of administration, but if it introduces measures
which are contrary to the general sense of the
Diet, they are never passed on any mere party
considerations, for the sufficient reason that no
parties exist. Its measures are thrown out
with the same promptitude and impartiality
as those of the most obscure private member
in an Australian legislature, when they fail
to create a favourable impression on the
majority of the Swiss lawmakers, and still
the Cabinet pursues the even tenor of its
way until its term of office expires. The
insane idea that a successful Government
should necessarily resign because it has been
defeated on, some obscure clog-tax proposal,
or other equally unimportant matter, is
essentially a party axiom, and has never even
been dreamt of in the Swiss Constitution,
and as the Republican Assembly recognises
the impossibility of ever forming an imma-
culate Cabinet, it declines to pledge itself to
follow any Cabinet through good or evil
fortune till it lands itself in ruin. The ill-
success of the British principle, according to
which the Parliament must either follow the
Government blindly for better or worse, or
else construct a new Government which it is
prepared to obey in this same unquestioning
fashion, suggests that the Helvetian Diet
has adopted the only possible solution of the
difficulty. No Ministry that ever was or
ever will be constructed deserves that ser-
vile obedience which is the only condition
under which an Australian or British
Government can possibly maintain its
position,
a # *
Moreover’, the Swiss Constitution recog-
nises the absolute impossibility of finding
eight or nine statesmen in one small Assem-
bly who can profess, without unscrupulous
mendacity, to be practically unanimous on
all questions of public policy, and it makes
no effort to secure such a collection of
phenomena. If two separate members of
the Cabinet insist on proposing measures of
a diametrically opposite character they can
do so, and the House can reject one or both
at its pleasure. Should any one or any half-
dozen Ministers desire to retire there is no
unseemly scramble for a dissolution, for
nobody has anything to gain by dissolving ;
the vacant places are tilled up by a vote of
the House, and the little commonwealth goes
on its way as before. There are no frantic
efforts to snatch a party victory, for the sys-
tem allows no scope for the formation of
parties, and even if they did exist no
one has any special use for a party at
all, and a vote of confidence is of no
value in an Assembly which shows its
entire confidence in each individual Minister
by the appointment of the Cabinet, and
which can get on about equally well whether
it has confidence or not. There is no oppor-
tunity for intrigue, and no necessity for buy-
ing up venal opponents or unreliable adher-
ents, for the Government’s position is secure
till the end of its term, and yet it has little
chance of abusing its trust, for it has no
personal supporters whatever, and the House
has no crisis to fear when it throws one Go-
vernment measure after another into the
ash-heap. And as a result of all these things
there are no violent assaults, no strong
language, and no excitement whatever,
neither is there the slightest necessity for
executing expensive public works on top of
an inaccessible mountain peak to gratify any
Influential member, for that disappointed
individual can’t go over to the Opposi-
tion by way of a picturesque revenge—’
Switzerland lias never owned an Opposition
since the present constitution came into exis-
tence a century ago. And after viewing the
matter in all its bearings, it appears to us
that this country might reasonably abandon
that political system of shreds and patches
which she copied from the grand old
mother land, and let government by contra-
diction have a rest, and attempt something
on the Swiss model in its stead, as the basis
of the Constitution of Federated Australia.
If there is any latent capacity for unselfish-
ness and honesty in the political world, it
would then have at least a chance to mani-
fest itself ; and if any ordinary measure of
honesty is too much to expect, there worth!
at least be some consolation in the knowledge
that our statesmen were dishonest under
c» msiderable difficulties.
Ex-Judge Trench, on “The Revolt of the
Jury.”
We have received the following letter from
the veteran ex-Judge Trench, Q.C., of Vic-
toria <■
Editor Bulletin; Sir, —ln your issue
of 19th ult. you published a leading article
entitled “The Revolt of the- Jury.” I
now write to express my high appreciation of
its merits as an able exposure of a most humi-
liating complication in the administration of
justice in our criminal courts. I concur fully in
all you have urged with such irresistible force
in that article; and I may remark that my
views on the subject have been formed in the
course of many years’ experience at the Bar and
on the Bench, and, moreover, have been well
matured by persistent study and reflection since
my retirement.
* * #
If you will do me the honour to glance over
the small pamphlet which I send herewith you
will see that I have made an effort to show how
the embarrassing complication, which I rejoice to
know has come under correction of The Bul-
letin, might, and ought to be removed.
# s *
I style my unpretentious pamphlet “ A
Standard of measurements of Sentences in
Criminal cases and a Reformed System of Penal
Discipline,” and I endeavour to show that the
root of the evil which you have, with such pre-
cision exposed, is hidden in the misplaced dis-
cretion with which the judges are saddled by
the peculiar phraseology of the statutes in limit-
ing the duration of imprisonment as a punish-
ment for particular crimes. The term of im-
prisonment. is expressed thus ; “ not exceedin'/
years,” and hence the judges are charged
with the awful responsibility of determining
whether a sentence shall be for the full term so
limited ; or, if not, by how much less than that
period a convict shall be imprisoned and sub-
jected to the horrors of penal discipline in some
one of the gaols. The science of correction forms
no part of a strictly legal education, yet the
judges, all untrained, are saddled with a discre-
tion covering the whole period of life—from t iro
sentence ‘ ‘ till the rising of the court, to ‘ ‘ for life,”
which must be exercised unaided by any fixed
principle or common rule to guide them. Under
such circumstances, what might be deemed the
exercise of a, sound discretion is impossible ; and
the result is that the administration of our
criminal law is a pronounced, most disastrous,
failure. Punishment lias not proved deterrent,
nor yet reformatory : but, on the contrary, the
“habitual criminal class” lias increased to an
alarming extent. Mr. Justice Webr, passing
sentence in “The Uembrook Tragedy ” case, is
reported in the Age of 24th inst. to have ad-
dressed the prisoner thus; “AN hilst sentencing
him he would keep him from contamination and
not start him on the downward career of crime,
which lie feared imprisonment in our gaols now
very frequently did/’ Add to this the cold-
blooded narrative of “The Suicide of Pierre
Douar,” reported in the Age of the 19th inst.
In the former case the culprit had the good
fortune to Ire in the hands of a judge gifted among
men with the instinct of the humane ; but the
wretched man Douar was systematically driven
to self-murder as the only mode of escape from
life “in the A division (which is worked on the
silent system”) under a sentence of two years in
irons, awarded by two visiting jvsticcs !
# * *
The law, as a whole, having to do with rights
and wrongs in civil and criminal cases —wrongs
becpmingcrimeswhcn they affect the public peace
injuriously —it is boasted of the civil jurisdic-
tion that for every infringement of a right there
is a remedy by action to recover redress in
pecuniary damages assessed by a jury. But in
cases where the personal wrong amounts to a
crime the civil remedy becomes valueless, being,
as a high authority has expressed it, “swal-
lowed up ”by the public prosecution. There is
no sufficient justification for this practice, as, I
think, is made manifest in my pamphlet. By
the expedient of two issues—a civil one for
damages and a criminal one as to the guilt of
the accused—being submitted to the jury at one
trial, punishment would practically be measured
by the jury. The evidence would be the same
on the trial of both issues. If the jury awarded,
say, exemplary damages, the verdict would be
entered in the usual way, and the verdict being
guilty on the criminal issue, the judge would
have nothing to do but to pass sentence of im-
prisonment with hard labour for the full term
limited by the statute, adding the qualification
following, “unless by appropriations of money
earned by the prisoner in gaol, to the liquida-
tion of the judgment debt, satisfaction shall be
sooner entered on the civil record,” or words to
the like effect. By this mode the duration
of punishment would be made to depend upon
the amount of the damages under the verdict of
the jury on the civil issue ; the judges would be
extricated from a false position : the private
prosecutor who had been assaulted and robbed
or •otherwise injured would have his damages
assessed by a jury with, probably, as good a
prospect of realising the amount as the average
litigant may count on ; and, moreover, under a
“Reformed System of Penal Discipline” the
unfortunate culprit is taken hold of by the
State, and compelled to labour with his hands
to make full amends. His imprisonment is for
safe custody ; the hard Labour part of the sen-
tence would be work honestly paid for at rates
of wages ruling in the open market, on the
principle of a fair day’s wages for a fair day’s
work, thus letting in hope and encouragement
and the consolation of knowing that the harder
he worked the sooner he would shake himself
free of his bonds. (laola would become as they
should Ire, self-supporting, and the whole cost
of crime be taken out of the criminals —Yours,
&c., Robert LePoer Trench.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Alleged Grand Duke.
Tub Grand Duke Nicholas At.kxaxhrovitch,
heir to tlie Russian throne, dullest and
most unpromising of Romanoffs, is alleged
to be contemplating a visit to Australia.
Should he come it is a pleasant and cheer-


iyg rejection that Australia will, no doubt,
have the grovel ready. To all the Anglo-
Saxon race the Romanoff who is afar off, is an
accursed emblem of the darkest tyranny on
earth, and his very name is a synonym for the
knout and the dungeon ; but to the Romanoff
w ho is near at hand, the nation wallows all the
same. The story of the exiles in the mines of
Siberia and the foetid marshes of Saghalien, the
tale of the “ hunger-strikes ” in the pestilential
prisons of Omsk and Tobolsk, the pitiable
narrative of ladies flogged and tortured to death
in the gaols of Northern Asia, may be real
enough at other times, but if the heir of a line
of butchers should choose to visit this country,
the “respectable” press will hail him with rever-
ence and admiration, women will take his blood-
stained arm at Government House, and the
great army of municipal flunkeyism will bow
before him, and the Church will dilate upon his
moral beauties, and all unpleasant subjects will
he buried as far as possible out of sight.
Humanity and democratic sentiment might
cause the nation to look coldly on such royal
slaughtermen as Coffee of Ashantee, or Gelele
of Dahomey, but the heir-apparent of the
Russian throne is an altogether different in-
stitution. In this respect England and Aus-
tralia stand on much the same level. The great
soul of the British nation swelled with indigna-
tion at the tale of the Polish butcheries of 1863,
but when the chief assassin—the lamented Czar
Alexander —visited London a few years later,
nobody, save one half-crazy Pole, dreamt of
refusing to do him honour. And for the sake
of the good name of Poland we remember, with
a species of regret, that that demented exile
was a lamentably bad shot, and thanks to his
nerveless hand a brilliant chance was thrown
away. I* is hardly likely that any such de-
pressing experiment will be repeated in Aus-
tralia, and if the Czarovitcii thinks fit to visit
this country, he may do so with a full con-
viction that nobody will fire at him, or at all
events, that nobody will fire straight enough
to do any damage. And supposing any
ruined outcast or expatriated Nihilist should
manifest signs of a disloyal turn of mind, it is
refreshing to think that an Act will promptly
be passed providing for the imprisonment of
everybody who refuses or neglects to take off
his hat and cheer whenever a Sovereign is men-
tioned, or whenever he comes across the name
of one in print, and to provide for the condign
punishment of everybody who fails to manifest
signs of boundless enthusiasm when he hears of
a monarch, either directly or indirectly under
any circumstances whatever. It is one of the
melancholy signs of human instability that the
Democracy, in most cases, is only democratic
when there is no use for it. It despises
monarchy and aristocracy in general and grovels
to the individual monarch or aristocrat at every
opportunity ; it 'prizes human liberty and it
sends a contingent to crush out liberty in the
Soudan, and having repented that insane
manoeuvre in dust and ashes, it is liable to
repeat the experiment in its next outburst of
popular frenzy, and to be disgusted at itself
afterwards for doing so. And, consequently, if
a Grand Duke should obtrude himself in Aus-
tralia there is no doubt that he will be received
with banquets and illuminations, and that he
will bo liailed as the grandest and noblest of
humanity : and the half-brick of obloquy and
contempt will only be heaved at his memory
after he is gone. But let us trust that the story
is not true, and that it will be his blessed
privilege to stay away.

Concerning Bastardy.
The kind attention of the numerous .fol-dimnt
purists who snuffle against any relaxation of
the law as regards illegitimacy, and believe
in letting the sins of the fathers descend
upon the “ offspring of sha-ame,” is hei’e-
by called to the fact that one Sir Richard
Wallace, Bart., has just passed hence in the
odour of sanctity and the love of his Sovereign
Lady, at the age of 72. Sir Richard Wallace
was what would be unctuously described as a
“bastard” if he hadn’t been a baronet. The
only things to distinguish Richard from the
common or garden kind of “bastard”—the poor,
scraggy, “ bye-blow ” with a neglected nose—
were the ghastly wickedness and iniquitous
wealth of his reputed papa, the fourth Marquis
of Hertford. If anyone here present has
fallen so far from grace as to read Thackeray’s
“Vanity Fair,” he will please to understand
that old Hertford was faithfully depicted in the
character of that revolting libertine, the most
noble the Marquis of St ey ne, and that one among
the myriads of Becky Sharers who ministered
to that cultured beast’s taste for debauchery was
the vehicle by which Sir Richard Wallace
arrived in this censorious world. When
“ Steyne ” Hertford died, some 20 years ago,
he left the major portion of his vast possessions
to this favoured “accident,” who was then
promptly created a baronet and K.C. B. in osten-
sible recognition of certain lavish gifts of money
and art-treasures which it pleased or suited
him to bestow upon the Nation. Dignified
clergy sat around Ins festive hoard and paid
homage to the notoriousreprohate’shastard sou—
the Archbishop of Canterbury was glad of any op-
portunity to shake his revered forefinger, Hehoh-
uohbcd with royalty, just as did the sporting
Hen ry Saville, illegitimate son and heir of the
late Earl of Stradroke. The purists who would
Hing “ the disgrace of his birth ” in the teeth of
any man born of Miss Mary, the house-
maid, through the agency of an impecunious
baker, acquiesced in that social law which re-
cognises tlie superiority of a noble’s bastard who
get the property over the “ rightful heir ” who
has little save his hereditary title to keep him
going Nothing, shrieks professional piety, can
wash off' the stain of his parents’ sin from
Mary's “nameless” child, and to let him stand
upon an equality with subsequent offspring "f
that guilty pair—offspring produced with the
sanction of the “ Church ” —were a direct
encouragement to immorality, urges the
parson. Observe how effectually the same
old stain can he gilded o’er by the gold
of a dissolute marquis, or earl, who never
atoned for, nay, almost justified, the in-
dulgence of a natural instinct by joining with
hig paramour in the holy bonds of matrimony.
What was Sir Richard Wallace’s baronetage
hul a royal encouragement to immorality, ae-
cording to the teachings of narrow-minded
bigots? How ready are said bigots to pocket
their scruples, and fawn upon such influential
“bastards” when they have a chance! The
cold-blooded cruelty of attempts to put a brand
of infamy upon the innocent children of un-
married parents is not more, obvious than the
hollowness and insincerity of that “morality”
which allows the rank and money of the male
progenitor to set aside a so-called religious
principle. We take the case of Wallace, not
by way of reflecting discredit upon the dead
man, but as a specially suitable sneer at the
Pharisees who profess their burning anxiety to
put “ illegitimate” children beyond the pale of
society. Sir R. Wallace, Bart., toiled not,
neither did lie spin. He was remarkable for
nothing but the wealth which was the result of
his unhallowed birth, and for the culchaw placed
within his reach by the whim of one infamous
as “the wickedest man in Christendom.” So
he died honoured and mourned by a virtuous
Queen and church, and the distressing tidings
of his demise were cabled over to Australia,
where nice old gentlemen like the Dean of Mel-
bourne are just now discussing the “ stain of
illegitimacy,” and endeavouring to rub it into
household Mary’s little lamb.
+.
A Happy Thought.
Coroner Ygtjl, of Melbourne, urges that a
Bill be passed commanding “that all un-
married women, anticipating maternity, shall
be compelled under severe penalties to
register themselves ” as a protection to their
offspring. A measure of an almost equally
stringent character is already before the Vic-
torian Assembly, but the unreasoning scare
which has arisen through the constant discovery
of dead infants in all manner of unexpected
places is leading the ‘ ‘ religious ” section of the
community to clamour for some tremendous
scheme of repression, and the coroner’s idea about
fills the Bill. Whenever anything goes wrong
in Australia the first idea of the governing
powers is to pass an Act demanding that the
person supposed to be responsible shall
register himself, and if things are very far
wrong the delinquent is generally required to
fill up a large blue form in addition, and deposit
it with some public functionary. If the case
is an absolutely desperate one provision is
also made that somebody shall inspect
something at certain intervals, and send
hi a report which nobody ever reads. The
necessity for finding out the cause and the pos-
sible remedy of a great evil is altogether subor-
dinate to the necessity for having that evil
“ inspected” and having an immense document
drawn up concerning it, and if the world is full
of misery it is much more important that that
misery should be entered and initialled in a big,
dog-eared volume than that it should be reme-
died. But while the coroner is on the job we
would be glad to know why he doesn’t insist
that the intending embezzler should also be
required to register himself before going off with
the cash, and why'the larrikin isn't to be in-
spected before he goes out and commits a brutal
assault. The results are likely to be about as
good in one case as the other. The girls who
had been led astray would nearly all evade
registration —the very fact that child-birth
would lay them open to a legal penalty and
public exposure, would make them ten times
more anxious than ever to risk and procure
abortion. Dr. Yotl threatens to be no more
successful in social science than the gimlet-hole
squi liters of the Social Purity Society. He starts at
the wrong end when lie tries to flatten out human
nature by the steam-roller of cut-and-dried law.
Without any possible desire to cast doubts on
the sanctity of human life, whether in infants
or coroners, we would be glad to know if Dr.
Yotl is prepared to do anything to make it
worth while for the kind of infant in question
to remain alive instead of being found dead in
a creek or a coal-box. To live, and be shunted
into a baby-farm, and be found a few years
later sleeping in a boiler or on a doorstep and
run in as a neglected child, and then to be
brought up in a reformatory, and to develope
afterwards into an “unemployed,” or to catch
an incurable cold doing pick-and-shovel work on
the roads, and to wind up by spending a joyous
old age in the Benevolent Asylum is not a sub-
ject for healthy ambition, and it is just possible
that many of the class whom the coroner yearns
over may live to wish that they hadn’t been
kept alive by quite so much registration and
“ inspection ” in the days of their cheerless
in fancy.

A Vegetable Wanted.
The University of Melbourne has risen in
majestic dudgeon, because one of its professors
the irrepressible .lenks —lately delivered a
speech in advocacy of the opening of libraries
and museums on Sunday. To quote the
language of an unspeakably solemn doctor with
a pained expression on his face, the Council feels
that “ it is intolerable that any section of the
community should have its opinions, or even its
prejudices, flouted by a salaried officer of the
University,” and under Ihose circumstances
•lenks is duly warned that he must never again
be found hollering in the van of any progressive
idea, or attempting to do good to his fellow
creatures. It is true that a late professor (Hearn )
of the same institution was allowed to go into
politics and to advocate the cause of “ pro-
putty ” for many years in the Upper House
without hindrance or remonstrance, but pro-
bably there is a difference somewhere, and it is
allowable to be a snag in the Dead Sea of the
Council, while it is absolutely disgraceful to be
a radical and a reformer in the Town Hall.
Still there doesn’t seem to be much inducement
to a. Melbourne professor under the new r<'<ihne.
If he isn't to sit on anybody's opinions or
prejudices he must lie a carrot rather than
a man, for no man ever lived who could agree
with everybody, and a man who is worth any-
thing to humanity generally starts by disagree-
ing with the views of most of the human race.
If lie is to contradict nobody then he can teach
nothing, for the one thing he is allowed to say
is what all the world knows already, and in that
case it is not worth while to say it. And if the
first requisite of a professor is that he must have
trodden on himself to such an extent as to have
lt>: I all do ire to contradict anybody, or to lake
part in any public movement, or to do any good
to humanity, lest he should injure the feelings
of somebody who didn’t want it done, then a
great difficulty will be experienced in finding
any sufficiently dull and soulless clod to fill the
bill. Even the worm, or the Rev. Robert
Spalding, will turn on an emergency, and as
the Melbourne professor is to be a person who
never turns at all, it is evident that he must be
humbler and flatter than either of these. And
when the requisite clod has been discovered what
good will he be after all ? A teacher is supposed
to be something better and more active than a
locomotive corpse crowded-up with Greek roots,
or a hollow image filled with participles ; and
if he isn’t he had better be replaced by a phono-
graph or by an automatic figure warranted to
speak when a penny is dropped into the slot.
As for the contention that the dignity of the
professor’s office should prevent him meddling
with matters relating to the common, outside
herd, it can only be replied that when any man
grows too dignified to be an ordinary human
being he had better resign his position in the
Caucasian race, and assume his rightful atti-
tude on all-fours. And when next a vacancy
takes place in the University of Melbourne we
would suggest that the Council should honestly
define the situation by inserting the brief but
comprehensive advertisement —• “Vegetable
wanted,” else some day it might find itself in-
volved in an unexpected charge of obtaining a
vertebrate animal under false pretences.

Taxation plus Kent.
In the Twentieth Century R. H. Cowdery
states that Henry George’s argument, if sound,
that ‘ ‘ all improvements, of whatsoever nature,
in the surroundings, conditions and abilities of
men, simply increase the rent he must pay to
the landowner,” nullifies any attempt to abolish
poverty by means of a land system that does
not wholly abolish the landlord. For, reason-
ing from this basis, the improvements in a
tenant’s condition resulting from a lessening of
taxation by the imposition of the Single-tax,
would, like other betterments under any system
of landlordism, therefore result in an increase
of rent; and a decrease in taxation that simply
puts money into the pockets of a privileged
class, simply defeats its own object. The
limited form of Single-tax, that which only
intends to confiscate sufficient rent to fulfill
fiscal uses, would, therefore, mean increased
rents, the burden of taxation being superadded
to that of rent. As for the unlimited Single-
tax, supposed to be equal to 90 per cent, of the
whole rental value of land, it would place the
landlords in the position of rent-collectors who
would deduct 10 per cent, from all amounts
collected ere handing them over to the State,
while the enormous sums that would thus come
into governmental hands would require to be
filtered back somehow for the benefit of
the community, leaving behind much of
their richness adhering to the sponges of
office and the treasury octopi. In any case,
the paying over to the State of sums which the
State then returns less wayside absorptions and
the wear-and-tear of Treasury travel, when thus
examined of itself does not seem calculated to
increase comforts and reduce responsibilities.
If George’s scheme be considered according to
his claims as a means to make landlords either
use or relinquish idle land, then Pentecost’s
plan —which would throw all vacant lots open
to the use and occupation of any man who
wants a home or craves an opportunity to toil—
has all the virtues of the Single-taxers’ methods,
none of its evils, and all the loveliness of ex-
treme simplicity.

The Melbourne 'Telegraph issues this sombre
note of warning re the incessant Public Library
problem : ‘ ‘ The occupant of the British Throne
is sworn to uphold a certain religion, of which
the due observance of the Sabbath is one of the
cardinal points ; therefore, Crown officials who
conspire against the sanctity of the Sabbath are
guilty of something like sedition. ” Perhaps so.
On reading this, it seems to us that the “occu-
pant of the British Throne ” has pledged herself
to uphold a thing that is a great deal too
large for her to lift, and that she has placed
herself very much in the position of a fly
that is walking off with a sack of flour.
Also, the “due observance of the Sabbath”
in this case only meant the way the
Telegraph observes the Sabbath, and if the
Telegraph observed the Sabbath just a shade
better that paper couldn’t appear at all on Mon-
thly morning. And further, “ sedition” is only
a comparative affair at the best; in the days
when that offence was a lit tle better defined,
the whole Telegraph staff would have gone to
gaol for publishing Parliamentary reports, and
consequently (his idiotic offence has fallen into
contempt; and as for “conspiracy,” if it is
conspiracy to agitate for the repeal of a Sunday
law, it is also conspiracy to agitate for the
passing of such a statute. And, lastly,
nobody cares a straw whether it is con-
spiracy and sedition or not, and it is
nobody’s affair what the “occupant of the
British Throne ” is pledged to, and that occu-
pant can either uphold the national religion or
let it go according as she feels inclined ; and if
she feels that the religion in question is slipping
she can sand her hands and take a fresh grip,
provided she wants to do so, and the “ obser-
vance of the Sabbath ” may keep on being a
cardinal point or give it up, just as it likes. It
won’t make the slightest- difference to anybody
in Australia.
The Remission of Penalties Bill, introduced by
Attorney-General Simpson into the New South
Wales Parliament, is a milk-and-water measure
apparently conceived in the interests of the
Conservative Press. ft does not abolish the
large penalties recoverable under some musty
English statute or other by any common in-
former who may prosecute a newspaper which
publishes advertisements of Sunday enter-
tainments to which admission is charged,
but it gives the Governor-in-Council dis-
cretionary power to remit any penalties
decreed by the Supreme Court. With
a perfect remembrance of the manner in
which Premier Parkes treated his political
enemies (Proctor. Walker, and so on) by
means of Um-dkerctionary power ve; ted in him
as Colonial Secretary, we regard the present Bill
with a sinister eye. Suppose, for example, that
The Bulletin alone had rendered itself liable
to such penalties, with what energy would a
politician whose minions vainly tried to crush
a Sunday newspaper by devious legal means
have rushed to the rescue ! Ha, ha ! (food
old Sir Henry Pakkes ! The present Bill is
merely a Bill to protect Fairfax and Sons, and
their rivals and imitators, and to prevent Tommy
Walker, the atheistic lecturer and Radical
politician.
That more or less eminent personage, the Earl
of Jersey, who is shortly to be shipped out as
Governor of New South Wales, has aroused the
enthusiasm of the “Liberal” Daily News,
which states that “ his lineage ought to
be sufficient to satisfy the most exacting
colony. ” We presume that Jersey’s ‘ ‘ lineage ”
simply means his ancestors, and, however
good they may have been when they were
alive they are no earthly use now that
they are dead. Besides, unless they are going
to be dug up and shipped out here what in
thunder have they got to do with the case, and
why should N.S. Wales be satisfied with them ?
It doesn’t want to take satisfaction out of any-
body’s dead relatives, and it can’t reasonably
Hit anybody’s ancestor after he is gone. And
if Jersey’s progenitors were first-class people
it is so much the more likely that they used up
all the brains in the family, for intellect
seldom lasts out two consecutive genera-
tions ; and if they were an idiotic lot
it is quite likely that Jersey is of the
same stamp, for brains are not infectious and
the other thing certainly is. The only reason-
able interpretation which we can put on the
News’ theory that New South Wales is to lie
satisfied with Jersey’s lineage rather than with
Jersey himself, is that the dead ancestors are a
better property than their live descendant, but
whether this means that they are bearing up
manfully against their deadness, or that such a
family is’ incapable of making a favourable im-
pression when it is alive, we are unable to
imagine. Possibly the real explanation is that
when the people of Australia inspect the new
Governor they will feel glad that there isn’t any
more of him in the family, and will be satisfied
to hear that the others are extinct, but anyhow
there is very little satisfaction in the paragraph

Of the late Mr. Dalley, Q.C., that gusiiing
young barrister, J. G. O’Ryan writes :
In a land where he never set foot, and was known only
to fame, and in the greatest and proudest city the world
has seen, he is to-day commemorated by a monumental
tablet in one of England’s most noble cathedrals.
Now Dalley visited England in ’61 — in com-
pany with Parkes —as an Australian emigration-
lecturer. Of the same gentleman, a P.C. by
courtesy, Lord Rosebery says :
Mr. Halley will live in history, not only as a colonial
Minister, blit also as an Imperial statesman.
Rosebery might have made an excellent chair*
man of the London County Council, but his
estimate of Dalley ’s hold on posterity is sadly
exaggerated. As a public orator, Dalley was
but a glorified Dan O’Connor ; as a litterateur,
he produced a few trifles, evidently so highly
polished by continual revision that all the virtue
had gone out of them. As a conversationalist,
he was charmingly reminiscential, as an ex-
temporaneous after-dinner speaker, he had no
equal in Australia ; but lie had no claim
to statesmanship. As The Bulletin has
already pointed out, his Soudan bid for
notoriety, however gratifying it may have been
to British ideas of the unity of the Empire, was
merely a useless expenditure of money, and in
the end alienated from him much of the venera-
tion with which he was previously regarded.
No drink is sold in the prohibition town of
Pullman, 11.5., says Rev. F. B. Boyce, and
there is no crime there nor any lock-up. Human
nature must have completely changed at Pullman.
If the town is without a lock-up where do they
put the gluttonous deacons and elders who get into
trouble with the girls at choir-practice, and where
do they locate the smug and oily moonfaced persoft
with the mutton-chop whiskers and long black
coat who fraudulently converts and embezzles the
estates of the widow and orphan? You can’t
wipe out the fact that in all countries there exist
certain special “pious” vices, such as seduction
accompanied by prayer, and trustorial sneak-
thiefery in the name of the Lord—mean things
done on the quiet and on the strength of the greasy
criminal’s good character. For instance, in Aus-
tralia bigamy is a peculiarly holy vice, with a
strong affinity for chemical lemonade and other
such hogwash; and it is the attorney who is a
(Sunday-school superintendent who usually steals
off in the dead of night without leaving any ad-
dress which would appeal to the credulity of
Detective-Inspector Oamphin.
The bitterest scoffer at G. A. (Salas
literary “ brightness ” never exposed the humour-
less senility of “ the king of journalists ” so com-
pletely as he himself has exposed it, in the Argus.
The other week G. A.S. prattled ; “ Life would be
a dreary waste indeed without Ally (Slobkr, ” and
went on to mention the “rollicking fun” of that,
inane publication. In common charity towards
the fat old man’s white hair we will try to think
that he must have a pecuniary interest in the
stupid thing.
Paul du Chaillu writes a timely article, in
the Fortnightly Review, on Central Africa. He
was the first to penetrate into the region now
described by Stanley. This was a quarter of a
century ago, and he had to stand the brunt as a
Munchausen, with his gorilla, and what not.
Since then he has been an Arctic explorer, with Ids
book on the “ Land of the Midnight Sun.” He
praises Stanley, but brackets him with his com
panions.
The Age has got itself into a rather deep
hole by printing a yarn to the effect that the
Yankee Consul in Melbourne had fled from a £406
debt. Next day the Consul turned up smiling at
his office and informed the inevitable interviewer
—not necessarily for publication but as a guarantee
of good faith—that he had been on view at
Government House for some hours during the
time of his alleged “disappearance.’ A writ for
libel was, at latest dates, in process of manufac-
ture, and David Syme was enquiring how the
something these things find their way into the
paper. According to spicy rumour, an unreliable
jade, by the way, there was a lady at the bottom
of this trouble.


[?]
84C Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 7, 1890.
My Dear Moorabisda,—
The second July “At Home” at Government House on
31st ult. was a purely hansom-cab function, since the
city roads were liquid mud ; nevertheless, the “ red draw-
ing room” was well filled. Lady Carington’s dress was a
dahlia-poplin skirt with bows and ends of moire ribbon,
Figaro jacket in dahlia velvet bordered with gold galon
over a pleated vest of white silk. Mrs. Burdekin appeared
in purple silk and velvet combined with panels of black
chenille fringe and Zouave of the same ; bonnet in velvet
silk and jet, and black parasol, .Miss Walenn wore Indian
red—hut as the room was very dark indeed it really didn’t
much matter what people “ had on.” Very little patronage
was accorded the verandah—the visitors stayed inside
and gushed over the superb camellias.
The Sydney creche, at 21 Macquarie-street South, and
run under the patronage of several philanthropic ladies,
was to have been set afloat by Lady Carington on 29th
ult., hut owing to unforeseen circumstances the ceremony
was indefinitely postponed. The creche is an eight-roomed
house, three storeys high, where children will be well
taken care of during the hours their mothers are at work
—supposed to lie from six a.m. to nine p.m. (a most
liberal allowance of labour, you will say), on the stroke of
which last hour every cherub will be expected to vacate
the premises. Every child will be undressed and bathed
on arrival and re-dressed in a cosy frock belonging to the
creche—Hie.donations of baby-wear have been extremely
liberal - and the children will he fed at inter-
vals on mutton - broth and oatmeal. No child
will be allowed to remain on the premises during the
night, but the upper rooms are filled with cradles and
cots for the youngsters to take their necessary naps. The
fee is only sixpence per day—as at the Brisbane creche,
which is said to he in a very flourishing condition. 1 may
he wrong, hut I cannot help t hinking that the institution
will in a short while find itself with many infants left on
its bands, and that it will ultimately develops into a
foundling hospital—the only real palliative of infanticide.
After all the gush over Neruda’s diamonds, I am told on
excellent authority that Lady Halle left her real jewels
with her banker in London and travelled with the pastepre.
sentments and reputation of the genuine articles. Some
of the great fiddleress s finger-rings are “ real,” however.
Popular enthusiasm didn’t exactly block the traffic at
Redfeni on 29th ult., the date of Sir Charles and Lady
flallri's final departure from Sydney per southern express.
Female “ society ” was represented solely by the Mayoress,
in light-brown flecked rough tweed, and male society
wasn’t represented at all, but the little company of
Believers who follow the gifted couple from city to city
to see that the big walnut piano doesn’t run away were
there to a unit, of course. Lady Hall 6, attired in black
gown and Colleen Bawn cloak, was in rollicking spirits
while the Knight was also blithesome in parting, and
became even waggish in thanking Mrs. Burdekin for the
boutonniere of primroses and snowdrops she gave him at
the last moment. Frances Saville went over to Melbourne
on the same train as the Halles, who had a carriage “all
to themselves,” of course.
It’s easier for a camel to cat a haystack than for a
presentation to happen in Sydney without a fiasco occur-
ring immediately on the heels of it. Only fifty guineas
rif the eighty due for the gorgeous trophy presented to
somebody'the oilier day were paid to the promoters, and
the climax was a heated person rushing wildly round with
a long blue hill, and only prevented with difficulty from
thrusting it at the victim of the presentation at an awful
moment. What is the usual “testimonial?” Merely the
wish or fad of one enthusiastic or interested man or
woman inflicted upon the indifferent multitude.
■ After sitting with one’s eyes, mouth, and ears wide
open through the performance of “ Frou-Frou,” it is
rather interesting to find yourself having a cosy chat
over a cup of tea with Mrs. Nora Frou-Frou Charrington
in her artistic drawing-room, gay with fans, photos, and
soft coloured art silks, as I did recently. Mrs. Charrington
is even more engaging off than on the stage, and in a slim
filling gown of chocolate brown cloth which sets off her
chestnut hair and beautiful skin, might have been some
“ beauty ” amateur travelling on Hie bridge of her nose
or the narrowness of her smile-a thing Miss Aohurch
disdains to be, of course An admirer of Tolstoi, a
disciple of Ibsen, a woman who thinks for herself and
doesn’t bore you with borrowed reflections on the difficult
social questions peculiar fo our era, that is our
Mrs. Helnier out of harness, with a very small baby
of most unsocial instincts—named Nora, after Hie
Ihsariian heroin?. Mr. and Mrs. Charrington are pleased
at the appreciation of Sydney audiences, and hope to play
a return season here, when another Ibsen conundrum,
" A Lady of the Sea ” (ending happily—according to the
gallery idea of happiness, that is) may he staged. During
the present season the hone of contention, “A Doll’s
House " (only taken off because Miss Acliurch cannot play
the pari 100 long without a rest) will he revived for a few
nights. Mrs. Gharrington’s pet parts are Nora Helnier
and Lady Macbeth, which latter she would like to play
for Sydney's benefit on her return. From Sydney the
Charringtons go to Tasmania (where they will not play
“ A Doll's House ”) and N.Z., and are due in London by
September, 1891.
Amid all those harassing arguments as to spiritual affi-
nities and so or), it is soothing to learn from Sydney D.T.
tint
A MIDDLE AGED Lady with means and comfortable
A home i»iv* * vacancy for middle-aged gentleman
hoarder with small means, views to matrimony.
Why not? How belter to discover whether Romeo’s taste
in the way the eggs should he Ixriled coincides with youis,
or whether his liking for pickled onions jumps with
Juliet’s; than to have him tame on the premises as a
stipendiary hoarder—before marriage,? Lots of connubial
shipwrecks would have been avoided if Torvald would
lodge with Nora's papa for a year—and when you reflect
that in the average marriage a man marries a girl because
She has curly hair or a killing smile, though her method
of cooking cabbage, for all he knows of her, may be
to put it into cold water —then one sees that mar-
riage is indeed a lottery. That middle-aged lady isn’t
going to leap in the dark. She wants, ere she finally
commits herself, to criticise the bouquet of that middle-
aged gentleman’s remarks when he comes home from a
“ lodge-meeting” at two a.m. She wants to see how he
looks in his shirt-sleeves howling for shaving-water on
Sunday morning, also what emotional effect a late dinner
or a hurst boot-lace has upon him before she gives her
happiness Inio his keeping and quite right, too. The
hoarder-suitor is a deliciously practical innovation—if
only society will stand him. And here you are, in the
Herald;
A HOME, in every sense of the word, offered to
- ‘ elderly lady and gentleman ; no young children,
no husband, no hoarders.
After a long retirement from public life—though she
has been a leading figure at private entertainments all
along—Miss Augusta Dargon (Mrs. Piercy) faced a small
hut select crowd (mostly personal friends) at the Y.M.C.A.
Hall on Ist inst., and was helped through a rather dis-
i ppointing hill by Mdlle. Ameris, Signor Hazon and others.
The stage was charmingly concealed with palms and ferns
(from Florist Maude), elf-lights, “Liberty” fabrics, gor-
geous furniture and huge screens, with a large British coat-
of-arms over the stage to lend added tone to the rest of the
fixings. The audience was decidedly wrappy and cappy,
femininely speaking, while the percentage of billiard-ball-
topped masculinity suggested the idea that there was
sawdust in it, and all the P.A staff were there in evening
clothes, and Consul Griffin and Carrie Swain (in a white
satin cloak) represented America on either side of the
aisle. Miss Dargon’s gown was eau dc nil armure with a
serial sort of train over a silken underskirt draped with
cream lace she wore a gold locket on black velvet round
her neck and a diamond brooch. Miss Ameris—Who
received a bouncing bouquet after singing “ II segreto
chose apricot brocade en traine with front of apricot
tulle powdered with gold, folds of white crepe inside the
bodice and pansies here and there of souvenir roses arid
ferns—a very taking toilet. Miss Dargon’s rendering of
the death scene of Mary Stuart was the treat of the
evening, the delivery of the piece, however, being I'atlie
handicapped at times by the unconquerable brogue of the
tragedienne.
In an essentially society play like “ Frou-Frou,” now
playing at Sydney Criterion, it is only natural that the
gowning should play an important part; hence the attire
sported by the ladies of the company helps the show a
long way with the women “in front.” I don’t care for
Frou-Frou’s get-up in the first act—it is like a doll going
to a party, but Fanny Enson’s dinner-dress in sunflower-
yellow brocade over full front of crepe de chine, With a
sage-green design in sunflowers going from the right
shoulder to the left hem and caught with green passe-
menterie, is art cxiremedy ilobby idea. In act two Frfm-
Frou serpentines round in a very special tea-gown
of salmon-pink brocade en Watteau over an un-
derdres.s of eau de nil crepe With puffed sleeves
of the crepe. Fanny Enson wears a “ good gown in
black rep silk and emerald-green velvet, Alsatian toque to
match, and Nila Steele is reminiscent of splash-work and
sealing-wax in a white gown braided with black and a red
poppy toque. In act three, Frou-Frou wears a gown in
soft green plush over an uuderdress in soft pink silk
which has a beautiful train and is fitted to a marvel;
Fanny Enson scores again in a mauve velvet coat with
panels of armure fshe vest-ending in long purse ends
with mauve pom-poms—of erripo de chine jupe of velvet
and armure, and how bonnet en suite an exceptionally
handsome toilette. In act four, Miss Acliurch wears an
art gowning in porcelain-blue woollen designed in gold,
the inner dress of tiger yellow crepe, sleeves slashed with
the yellow, while a scarf of the same colour falls to the
feet in front. In the last act' Frou-Frou’s gowning is
black, of course, hut Enson comes out strong in grey
brocade and silk with bonnet to match".
At the tenth annual meeting of the N.S.W. Art Society
it was shown that the Society has a credit balance of
ACTS Bs, 9d. The annual show will take place this year on
6th prox., when among the portraits exhibited will he re-
productions of Mrs. Threlfall, Dion Boucicault, jun., and
Dan. O'Connor. It has been decided to build new rooms
for the Society throe times as large as the old ones.
The Anglo-Australian Society of Artists open in the
York-street Rink on 13th inst., when Lord Carington,
accompanied by Lady Carington, will set the.hall a-roiling
precisely at 3 p.m.
Ever since Inaugural Arbor Day at Ryde there has been
a perfect epidemic of spades, little treelets in potlets,
and general holidays at public schools, while everybody
plants a tree so that posterity may find itself possessed of
at least one realisable asset in the shape of firewood.
Wavcrlcy Public School avborated on Ist instant in the
presence of a crowd of local people and a peppering o
M’s.L.A., headed by the member for Paddington, who
broke into poetry at the end of his humourous speech,
after which everybody agreed it was time for refreshment,
which was daintily set out in a class-room and partaken
Of by the invited guests. Mrs. Carruthers, wife of the
Minister of Public Instruction, in a black gown and
jacket with crape revers, perpendioularised the first
shrub, fol'owed by Mrs. Alfred Allen (one of the lady
members of the local hoard', who wore a handsome dark
green silk gown with black velvet and passementerie
Visite and bonnet in green and cream tints. The pro-
ceedings concluded with the inspection of the cadets, and
tree-planting by Mrs. Guest (Mayoress) and other ladies.
The first Sydney orchestral concert (new series) will
eventuate at the Centennial Hall on 16th inst. The
subscription-list isn’t filling very fast, but the promoters
hope for (he best. Which reminds us that the “thin’’
attendance at the first Hallri return concert at Melbourne
wasn’t duo to the weather, but to the booking, which was
wretched.
If Miss Acliurch stages Ibsen’s “ Lady of the Sea” in
Sydney, there will ho a great backsliding among the little
company of believers in the Norwegian G.0.M., I know.
For the plot is too clear. A young Viking mashes a
maritime maiden—flings Hie “ engagement” ring into tire
mottled deep, with Hie spiteful remark that she can’t
“break it off” now unless she hires a diving-suit, and
then fades away arid forgets to come back until the girl
marries a soap-boiler, or something capable of eating
three square meals daily. How the Viking is of
opinion that Hie marriage-certificate is as naught to the
rusty ring in the raging main as a matrimonial guarantee;
how the Ibsenish wife is at first of the Viking’s opinion,
and is distracted with doubt until a surprisingly rational
• moment arrives when she fires the Viking out and cleaves
to the soap-boiler, will ho so much gall and wormwood
to some of the feminine disciples of “A Doll s House,”
who would rather the old man got his “deserts,” of course.
The Halles have occasion to he humbly thankful to an
individual who shall he nameless, lately connected with
their concert-tour. To him in Sydney one day came an
excited parent, who wanted to he t vd how he could burst
in upon Sir Charles at the head of a gesticulating deputa-
tion of other excited parents and implore him to preside
at a monster matinrie where all the kids who hang the
piano or Scrape the fiddle should play their best—the
Knight and his lady to deliver judgment at the finish!
It was a nobly selfish idea—actuated, probably, by the
fact that the originator’s Mariar could play “Alice” rings
round the minx next door, who took on airs, and he
wanted to squeeze the conceit out of her at once. However,
owing to the strategy of the person referred to in the
beginning, the deputation didn’t wait. Let other distin-
guished musicians beware.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Sydney Reunions held the last hut one of their well
managed dances at West’s rooms on Ist August, when,
owing perhaps to its I icing Bank holiday, the attendance
was hut moderate. The dresses were very pretty in some
instances, a gown in white satin with tulle waterfall,
the front draped with tulle, dotted with clusters of lilies
of the valley ; a mauve silk made perfectly plain ; and a
dress in shades of tan in silk, moire and fisher's net, look-
ing very well indeed. But one or two fearsomely baggy
old-fashioned “Greek” garments, only tolerable when
they were “in,” suggested all manners of things. The
refreshments were nice, as usual, and floor and music
extremely good. The Reunions will not be held during
next season.
Woollahra private assemblies held another hop at
Nithsdale on Ist hist., when the fun was fast and furious,
as usual. An appealing toilette was in ecru armure
draped with crystal net and clusters of deep red roses;
lavender crepe de chine in lamp shade pleats over an
underdress of panSy silk, was also very pretty. The music
by Need’s band was excellent.
At a meeting of the Sydney University Union, the other
week, the question, “That greater realism in English
literature would he undesirable,” was decided in the
affirmative. Of course. People must have some induce-
ment to study the classical language's.
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Mort and family were passengers
for England by the Massilia, on 28th ult. They will not
stay long away, going merely for the trip, which is very
pleasant just now.
As mess dinners are for men onlj', only men will be
pleased to hear that the officers of the Permanent
Artillery intend to repeat the social experiences of 25th
ult., when a mess dinner was discussed to the strains of
the Artillery band, and the guests were both plain and
coloured. It is proposed to make these successful little
feeds of monthly occurrence.
Governor Carington is to be present at tbe ’Varsity
Dramatic Society’s production of that hoary chestnut,
“ Blow for Blow,” in the great hall on 9th hist.
A big ball, in aid of the Women’s Fund, will be held on
the 20th hist, in the Centennial Hall (granted for use
without money and without price by the Mayor of
Sydney) under the patronage and in the presence of Lord
and Lady Carington and suite. Additional inwardness
wjil be lent to the ball as being the first held in the
finished building. ' As the Women’s Fund, apart from the
Jubilee, is a very sound charity, the festivity should at-
tract a large attendance.
There is, some idea of getting up a Sydney:Shakesperian
Society, the members of which will meet at one another's
houses to read and discuss the little efforts of the divine
William. The Mayoress (Mrs. Burdekiri) is interested in
the movement, which, however, is only under discussion
at present.
Lady Carington will he “at home ” to all and sundry—
especially sundry—at Government House on Thursday,
21st hist, at half-past three. It is to be hoped the weather
won't he so lachrymosely inclined as it was on the last two
of these occasions.
East Sydney Rowing Club hall will happen at AVest’s

late Mr. Alfred Sandeinan, of Sydney, and .Mr. J. R. Tin-
dale, of Nantgellian, N S.W., is announced to take place at
•St. John s, Darlingliurst, at 7.30 on Bth hist. It is to be
an “evening-dress” ceremony.
On July JOth a quaintly-stylish wedding came off at St.
Andrew’s Cathedral, when Mr. If. A. M. Merewether, of
Castlefield, Bondi, was muted with Miss Edith H. M'Cahe,
of Bellambi. The bridal array was in armure and crepe
and Brussels lace, and the.hanquet a very special florist’s
effort. The going-away gown was'in 'black and old rose
with hat en suite.

A story has been going the rounds of the
press lately of a Hungarian woman who kept her-
self within doors for thirty years, as a self-inflicted
punishment for going out to a fair after promising
her sweetheart that she would not do so. Strange
as it may seem, that narrative has its parallel in a
prosaic suburb of Sydney. Let those who are in-
clined to indulge in a little sentiment take the
Newtown tram, and when opposite the skating-rink
a little distance this side of the Missenden-road
they will see above a large hoarding the roof of a
house, in which for 34 years a woman kept herself
a prisoner, watching and waiting for a lover who
never returned. Some 37 years ago Miss Flora D.
was a beautiful and wealthy girl, residing with
her father in that old-fashioned house. She was
engaged to be married to a man who has since
risen to high rank and is now in England, if hs
bo alive. One night, in Miss D’s home, they
had a quarrel over the usual weighty mat-
ters that set lovers by the cars, and Mr. N.
as he was going out remarked, “ Flora, when this
door closes on me to-night it closes on me for
ever.” Miss D. caught the door ere he could shut
it and called him back in vain, for he came no
more. She-stopped at the door all night saying,
“The door must nob bo closed, lie will return.”
Next day, seeing the futility of all entreaties to
her to come away, her father agreed to have the
door fixed so that it could not be closed. A car-
penter was called in, the fastenings adjusted, and
so it remained year in and year out that the par-
able of the foolish virgins might not be again ful-
filled. Another doorway had to be cut at the side
of the house, and the front door was never used
again. Some three years ago Miss D. died, aged
about 58, but up to the day of her death if she
heard any noise in the front a servant was des-
patched at once to see whether Mr. N. had come,
or if anyone was meddling with the door. The
house has been deserted lor some time, but it
stands to-day a mute witness to the fidelity and
patience of a foolish, tender-hearted woman.

We struggled up the Hill of Difficulty
which leads to Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall, the othet
evening, against an outgoing stream of Young,
and, probably, Christian Gentlemen, from whom
emanated a religious aroma, in some eases tem-
pered by a soupron of whisky-u hilf. Alt Hb of
these Youpg Christian Gentlemen Moiled with
difficulty, and others, remembering that they were
mere earthly worms, seem to lay themselvts out
for being trodden on, but vainly. The summit
was attained at an early hour, and so we stood on
the mat among the greenery like a latter-day
serpent in a modern Eden to watch the
tide of fashion and beauty wriggling upstairs.
A tide did we say ? Almost an Irish sea,
for so strongly was it tinctured with Hibernians
that it suggested the Charge of Fontcnuy, an
item fortunately omitted from Miss Dargon’s pro-
gramme of Friday last. Proceedings were opened
by tbe string-band of the N.S. W. Artillery of
whom it was remarked by a journalistic cynic in
our vicinity that they Avero not players but com-
posers. Improvisation when a collective effort
has decided disadvantages. The recitals of Miss
Augusta Dargoh were, as of yore, full of sustained
vigour and line drapaatic contrast, though her
voice has, to some extent, parted company with its
earlier flexibility, but that may have been due to
the weather. Nevertheless, in everything she did
the artist was manifest, though her recitals
throughout, chiefly tragical, partook somewhat
of the lugubrious, particularly in the selection
from Tennyson's “ Queen Mary.” Miss Ameris,
known in Sydney chiefly by her appearance in
“The Yeomen of the Guard,” sang two songs with
a fuller voice than she formerly produced, and
Bandmaster Devery, in a clarionet solo, showed a
perfect mastery over the instrument, though sug-
gesting, somehow, Maccabe’s burlesque, in which
the “ pore toon is worried to death by the waria-
shun.” Miss Minina Paige, a pupil of Mine.
Charbonnet-Kellerman, played a pianoforte solo
in a manner which was not calculated to make
Halle tremble. Throughout the Young Christian
Gentlemen voluntarily supplied an Indian Club
obligato from the rear of the stage. Manager
Stopford was in front, and informs us that these
recitals will be continued should public patronage
warrant.

The awfully moral persons'who objected
so strenuously to Nora’s desertion of her husband
for'“a mere whim,” having approved of, or at
least failed to denounce the conduct of Gilberte,
who forsakes her husband for the arms of a
younger man, business has not been so good at
Sydney Criterion during the “Frou Frou” run as
in that of “A Doll’s House.” The performance
all round has greatly improved on the opening
night’s, and is doubtless in advance of any repre-
sentation of French emotional comedy seen here
for years. “Fedora” will probably be staged in
the middle of next week.

Despite cold, rain, wind, hail at Sydney
Royal, good houses prevail. The excellent stage-
management of “ Paul Jones,” thanks to Johnny
Wallace, is a thing of universal comment; in fact,
no one seems to growl except some ladies who
consider that Tenor Wood field, who looks lovely,
hasn't a fair show. We prefer Marian Burton’s
decollete notes to her high necked efforts, which
are sometimes a little “chinny,” but- Nellie
Stewart seems always to produce the proper key
from her private bunch, though she might resp ml
to encores with a better grace. The lady who
says nightly, without stop or accentuation, “ A-
duel-never-the-ambush-is-laid,” or something to
that effect, always reminds us of the cld-time
Sydney hash-house waitress with her “Roast-beef-
boiled-mutton, &c., vvhat-your’s ?” monotony, and

Harry Rickards re-opened at million prices
on Saturday night last at Sydney School of Arts
to one of the largest houses ever crammed therein.
The Co. has been reconstructed for the better
since last visit. Ada Walker, almost unknown
to Sydney audiences, has a sweet, cultured
voice. Mrs. Rickards plays the slavey quietly
and effectively in an adaptation of “Turn Him
Out,” in which ’Arry enacts a coster to the life.
Rickards brings several new songs along ; and one
of Godfrey’s sketches, “ Seeing Life,” is certain to

The unexpected illness of Maggie Moore,
first made known to the management of Her
Majesty’s on Saturday at 1 p.m., would have
closed that building, for the evening at all events,
had .things been in less vigorous hands. But
messengers were sent hither and thither, the Meg
s.t nery and properties were stowed away and
others substituted, a rehearsal given at 4 o’clock,
and precisely at 8 the curtain rang up on “After
Dark” to a kindly audience, not prepared in all
cases, despite the hanging out of notices, for the
change. “ After Dark” will be run until “The
Corsican Brothers” is quite ready for production,
unless the management deem it advisable to revive
some old favourite for a fortnight or so. Meantime
the piece will be livened up by the engagement of
the best talent on hand for the music-hall scene,
in which Baby Nicholls, Arthur Rigby, “Bill
Stevings of Bonding,” Chucky Osborne, the
dancer, Billy Warner, and others take part.

charge for admission will be ss. and 3s, The hall,
however, will be open on certain Saturday evenings
to those who can afford to disburse half-a-crown
and eighteenpence. We are inclined to think that
these charges are altogether too high. The organ
belongs to the entire community, and a very large
sum has been spent in order that they may be
amused and refined. Mayor Burdekin is its
official controller, and it should be his first care to
, oe that the general public have an opportunity of
receiving some return for large expenditure on
what is the joint property of all, even if the_ Hall
be thrown open free of charge during a series of
evenings. The organ is surely not regarded as a
mere machine for money-making.

The Bijou alone, of all the Melbourne
theatres, rejoiced in a crowded attendance last
Saturday. “ Kerry ” and “ The Balloon,” which
together constitute a full bill with a wide sweep,
are evidently destined to repeat the Sydney success
of a few months back, every pigeon on the ground
being safely grassed with one or other of B. and
lb s barrels. It is particularly noticeable that the
superior, but under-dressed females, who cannot
weep over “Kerry” because their backs are too
chilly, laugh themselves into a warm glow by th -
time* Brough has descended from his brief visit b»
the heavens above. In truth, “The Balloon” is
brighter and more human in its absurdity than
any farce lately produced in these parts, notwith-
standing that” both plot and dialogue have a
chestnut flavour, and about the performance
there is a wild freshness that does infinite credit to
a company whose personalities have become so
familiar in a succession of pieces running on the
same light lints. But for some occasi nallapses
into exaggerated buffoonery, Brough’s sketch of
the victimised doctor is almost as acceptable as
Anton’s finished picture of Eitzjohn, a character
strongly suggestive of the “Rocket.” Miss
Homer is incisively droll, as usual, and for thex-est
Mrs. Brough, Lyndal, Emma Temple and Pattie
Browne, play parts well within their grip in a
manner that—as the daily journal delights to ob-
serve— “ leaves nothing to be desired.” They arc
quite nice enough to eat, with the male exception
of Lyndal, and even he, being a cheerful, seraphic
curate kind of young man, might make a satis-
factory meal for many hungry virgins, if be were
curried.
Boucrcault’s performance of Kerry—in
which he is handicapped (by the penalty attach-
ing to youth) above his grand, giddy progenitor,
and J. C. Williamson —revives recollections of the
ill-fated French company who played the original
of Dion B.’s comedy at Exhibition time. As com-
pared with a foreign gentleman who was eternally
toeing the footlights to jabber his joys and sorrows
at the stalls, Boncioault the younger is great all
the time. At the last, when his legs collapse and
his overwrought frame begins t > fall asunder, tbe
genuine pathos of the situation moves even the
dress circle to a display of enthusiasm. Mrs.
Brough, as the wife restored to the arms of a
drowned husband, is best when the strain upon
her powers is greatest, and the others are good
enough. The present programme should remain
in full blast until part of the company go Sydney-
wards, in two or three weeks’ time.
“ Held by the Enemy,” as set up at the
Opera House, is richer in gunpowder than in
genius. When the supreme interest of a story is
centred in a corpse, suddenly disclosed to view
upon a stretcher, the gloom requires to be relieved
by brighter light comedy than Miss Madge Sey-
mour and Greenaway can rise to. The latter
seems natural enough at times, but the young
lady’s artificial vivacity is more gruesome than the
aforesaid dead body. Equally trying is Miss Mel-
ville's undignified conception’ of a maiden aunt,
while Miss Watts-Phillips becomes woefully stagey
after a pretty love-scene with Inman,in the first act.
In point of fact, the company supporting William
Rignold are not equal to the strong work before
them, and even of the “ star's” vigorous perform
ance it will probably be said that the truth is not
in it. Rignold’s idea of an army-surgeon seems to
have-been grafted on old Jack Saxton, and tb •
suspicions' sawbones is noisy and choleric where t >
most minds lie should appear cold-blooded an I
soldier-like. Anyway, bis big scene with ilo
stretcher created only a moderate effect on Satur-
day night, nor did the drama exert a paralysing
influence at any other point.
A revival of “La Tosca,” at Melbourne
Princess’, failed to crowd the house where it ran
four weeks on the lirst production. The present
performance naturally shows a slight improve-
ment in the direction of Mrs. Potter, and when
that interesting artiste can be induced to tone
down her right arm, and put her smile under
restraint, she will wear the mantle of Sara Bern-
hardt without finding it so many sizes too large.
As a masterpiece of dramatic art “La Tosca”
must command sufficient attention (albeit times
are phenomenally bad in Melbourne) until Satur-
day, when “ Frou-Frou ” is expected to fetch up
the rank and fashion in large quantities.

“ Formosa” has sinned and repented to
disheartening business, at the good old Royal,
where the sweet little flower of success has left off
blooming for many a night. The old doctor, and
Airs. Boker, not to mention sundry other
calamities, have proved too much for “Formosa,”
though the warmth recently infused into the name-
part by Miss Edith Blande ought to make a
bright red spot appear on the top of every bald
head in the city. George Darrell purposes fling-
ing himself into the deadly breach next Saturday
(oth) with his latest hair-raiser, “ The Lucky
Lot.” A lot of luck is just what the theatre
wants badly.

At the Alexandra, too, Bland Holt intends
to run up “The Golden Ladder” on a scale of
splendour, and “ Master and Man,” which has
outlasted two contemporary productions, is now
on the verge of retirement. Such a show, at such
prices, is seldom or never seen hereabouts, and the
renowned Alexandra gallery is a greater site for
the gods than ever The Victoria Hall still keeps
its capable nigger-crowd going, while the pros-
perity of the Gaiety, under Slade Murray’s man
agement, has been enhanced by an alleged mis-
creant, who made an unsuccessful attempt to
burn it out of existence last Sabbath morning. In
this averted tragedy Slade Murray says he detects
the hand of some jealous rival, or arch-enemy of
the State, whose fiendish design was frustrated by
an all-merciful fire-brigade. A shilling admission
fee has turned up trumps for the Phonograph, but
the second season of the Halles, at Melbourne
Town Hall, is serving to expose the hollowness of
any boom in classical music. Sassiety has “ turned
it up” to a considerable extent, and the Knight
and his Lady are discovering that a bogus taste
for sonatas is apt to come and go, like a swarm of
locusts, while the people really educated up to
severe music expect to go in on the classical nod.

Alfred Danipier has just flashed above the
horizon with a very significant advertisement to
the effect that he holds the sole rights of “drama-
tisation and representation ” of sundry Australian
literary works, notably “ Robbery Under Arms,”
and “The Miner’s Right.” It is vaguely sus-
pected that somebody or other might, could,
would, or shouldn’t desire to jump Dampier’s
lawful claims, so the advt. is perhaps intended to
lighten the moral darkness of such individuals
and bring them face to face with the awful conse-
quences appertaining to any nefarious scheme of
the description hinted at. If any persons decline
to accept this solemn warning, the damages will
be upon their own heads.

“ A terrible statement rca,c.hes mo to the,

autumn production at Drury Lane.” This is
clipped from the London Sporting and Theatiu-

accepted Charles as being a popular idol, instead
of an extinct volcano, at “ home.” Londoners
knew their Warner by heart fifteen years ago.

Geelong is waking up even in the matter of
show business. Charles Hugo was recently lined
20s. and costs for allowing the passages of the local
theatre to be blocked-up by an excited throng of
patrons. For years it has been the dream of
managers’ lives to fix “ standing-room only ” out-
side the Geelong theatre. The few lost sheep who
attended were usually lured in by the inducement
of being able to lie all along the benches.

During the recent production of “After
Dark,” at Melbourne Royal, it was at first ar-
ranged that a super should act as double to Grade
Warner and make the plunge into the water, but
that the rescue should be done by Charles Warner
himself. But the “ eminent” one was not going
to catch cold over it. Certainly not. His life
was much too valuable to be lost to the Australian
stage. Arrangements were accordingly made for
heating the water to such a pitch that it could be
bathed in with some feeling of personal comfort.
Even then it was not without a good deal of cogi-
tation as to the possibility of knocking out tin-
bottom of the tank with his head that the great
man made the plunge. Make it he did,
however, and then looked for the reward
of courage in the shape of press-notices.
To his intense disgust, however, more than on-
critic announced that a “made-up” super, tod.
Charles Warner’s place for this particular- hid
dent. This was more than Warneresque human
nature could bear, and he promptly “chucked’’
the jumping business from that day. The unfor-
tunate fifteen-shilling-a-week man, who was told
off to make the plunge in his place, found, how-
ever, that hot baths were meant for his master,
and had the pleasure of sousing himself every
night in water pretty well down to freezing-point,
the heating apparatus being now “ quite unneces-
sary, deah boy.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last year I was at Lewis Ponds, and had been
staying at one of the hostelries. As I was about
leaving I found I had on hand three-parts of a
bottle of whisky, and not wishing to take it into
Orange - there 1 passed as a never-touoh-it —I
generously decided to make a present of it to two
men whom I had seen knocking about the pub.
I had not far to look for them —they were yarning
in the long dining-room.
“Well, boys,” said I, “will you have some
whisky ?’
“ Gratias tibi,” said Peter, the elder of the two,
who, though an habitual soaker, was a man of
education and accustomed to season his discourse
with Latin scraps.
“That seems good stuff,” quoth Jock, Peter’s
companion.
“ Daresay you’ll find it so,” said I, leaving them
to their own devices. As it wanted some little
time to the starting of the coach I strolled up the
verandah and round by the side of the house.
Chancing to glance through a rent in the blind, I
saw Peter in the act of sampling the liquor, which
was evidently much to his taste. I had uo diffi-
culty in hearing the conversation that ensued or
in seeing all that happened.
“ Well, old man, I’ll have a try now,’ - said Jock,
rather nettled to see his companion knocking the
cork hard home with his hand.
“ You’re much better without it, my man, much
better.”
“That be blowed for a yarn, the boss gave it to
me as well as to you.”
“ Ah, yes, but lie does not know you so well as
I do —he probably takes you for a drunken sot,
like me. ’
“Sot or no sot, I want ray share of the whisky.”
“You should restrain your desires, Jock, they
arc really not healthy.”
Why don’t you restrain yours then ? It’s easy
for you to talk.”
“ I can’t do it, Jock ; you can and must.”
“ Why can’t you do it as well as me ? I tell you
what, you have a dashed cheek.”
“ Not cheek, Jock, not cheek, call it neurosis.
1 have a neurosis, and a d big one too.”
“What’s the good of shamming sick to me? You
want all the liquor, that’s all about it.”
“ My dear fellow, a man with a neurosis is not
necessarily sick—let me explain. A neurosis is
primarily a condition of nerves —but I see that
does not enlighten you. I’ll go back further. My
grandfather I don’t recollect, but my father I do
remember very well, and a nice pippet he was,
too, for as far back as I can call to mind, he was
an inveterate boozer —drunk every chance he got.
I have no doubt that he inherited from his
father a condition of nerves which predisposed
him to the intoxication habit. He was born, in
fact, with a neurosis, which he sedulously culti-
vated. Sedulously in this instance, Jock, means
systematically, lovingly, cheerfully. Ah, yes, I
see you quite understand. Very well. The old
man had the neurosis, and by all that’s holy, he
developed it tremendously before I was born.
You see he transmitted to me, as an heirloom, the
neurosis of his father, but with added strength.
“ Never mind that, I want my drink,” said
Jock.
“ Don’t interrupt me, my dear fellow—as I was
explaining I was born with a neurosis and cannot
help drinking.”
“ What are you giving us, you darned old liar?
You like it.”
“ Like it! ” chuckled Peter, hugging the bottle
caressingly; “ like it—l should say so. That’s the
neurosis. Nosv you don’t like it.”
Here Jock waved his hand deprecatiugly.
“But,” continued Peter, not minding the in-,
terruption, “ I tell you what will happen, if you
force yourself to like it, or by drinking for com-
pany sake allow the habit to become strong—you
will acquire a neurosis, and, what is worse,
transmit it to your children.”
“ Confound you !‘I have no children, and you
know it. ’
“ Quite so. I speak not of children born, but to
be born. For my part, I shall not marry. I owe
a debt to society not to transmit any neurosis—
with me ends a race of drunkards. Jock, my
friend,” continued Peter, rising and waving his
left-hand, but still embracing the bottle with his
right, “do not, I beseech you, by fostering the
drinking habit, sin against society, sorely injure
your bodily health and ” —darting out the door —
“ ruin your immortal soul. ”
“Well, I’m jiggered !” said Jock, “loughter
known the old dorg would collar it all. ”
HENRY SIEBEL.
In London they lately auctioned a lot of
relics from Sippera, Babylonia. They were clay-
written tablets, about 3000 years old, including
some of business transactions, as, for example, the
record of a law-suit by a large fruit-grower against
a proprietor of boats for losing cargo. From these
tablets it is ascertained that slaves were mort-
gaged, banks kept, and everything went on in a
Collins-street way.
The Duke of Fife, who is grandson-in-law,
or step-uncle, or something of the sort, to her
Gracious, had to appear in a common, beastly
police court and swear the other day, and in order
not to hurt his feelings the Bible was wrapped in a
clean cloth before he kissed it. All sorts of vulgar
ordinary people had been embracing that volume,
dontcherknow, and labourers and washerwomen
had testified on its infected boards, and niggers
had come in contact with it, and drunks and
dubious Asiatics had been using it, and fellows in
the retail coal trade, and fellows who smelt of fish,
and costermongers, and persons in the bone and
old fat industry, and chimney-sweeps, and in-
dividuals fresh from the boiling-down business,
and parties who shovelled garbage off the streets
had all been there in turn ; and though the book
was still good enough for any ordinary witness a
duke couldn’t be expected to approach it in its
naked state, unless he was careful to keep to wind-
ward.
Mary Amlorsou’s wedding is thus de-
scribed :
Miss Mary Anderson can boast of having had the most
exclusive wedding of the season. Not only were the
general public excluded from the little church at Hamp-
stead, but the whole of the wedding party, including the
two registrars and the clergyman, Canon Purcell, only
numbered 14, arid no one else was allowed to enter under
any pretence whatever. It was even said that the keyhole
of the door was stuffed up with paper. Certain it is that
the door was both locked and barred during all the time
of the ceremony. Amongst other extraordinary rumours
which flew about was the strange one that Miss Anderson
had arrived at seven o’clock to early Mass, had
then gone straight to the Presbytery which is
next door to the church —and had had her dress
sent-to her, that she might dress at the priest’s house
and so prevent the public seeing her arrive.
Stranger still, lots of people gave the report credence.
The first little excitement was the arrival of the bride-
groom and his brother—the best man—in a hansom. The
two brothers are very much alike, plainly showing their
Spanish origin in their dark skin, hair, and eyes. The
bridegroom, Antonio de Navarro, is not tall, and, though
the difference is not much, he looks a trifle shorter than
his bride. They refused to face the crowd, and went into
the church by the priest’s house. The next to arrive was
the carriage containing the little half-sister and half-
brother of Miss Anderson, the boy in terra-cotta velvet,
Directoire coat,- and knee-breeches, with a white
waistcoat; the girl in white muslin, with deep scar-
let velvet knots, and a scarlet flower at her waist.
They were accompanied by Miss Anderson’s maid, the
only spectator who was not a relation, with the exception
of eight little orphanage boys, who strewed flowers down
the aisle. Then came the bride’s brother and his wife,
the latter in brown, closely followed by Hr. and Mrs.
Griffin, the bride’s mother and step-father. Mrs. Griffin
wore a deep heliotrope velvet dress, the front petticoat
of silk being covered with black wide-mesh lace
or canvas, embroidered in a large pattern. Her
white bonnet rendered her pale and delicate

face yet paler, and it was evident she had
not recovered I.oui her late i.lncs ; . A inoni i.t
later the bride came, attended by her eldest half-
sister, Miss Blanche Griffin, who is a most beautiful
o-iri of eighteen, quite as beautiful as Miss Anderson,
though lacking the sweet nobility which characterises
“ Our Mary.” The bridesmaid’s dress was reported to be
made by Worth, but it seemed to me too simple in design,
though exceedingly pretty and suiting its wearer to per-
fection. It was of soft grey cashmere, the round yoke of
white silk, the bodice of grey being drawn up on to the
silk. Round the bottom of the bodice was a thick plaited
twist of coni in white, knotted in front on tire left side,
and hanging to the bottom of the skirt. A hat of white
tulle, very simple and young-looking, and a bouquet
of pink roses with white streamers finished the
toilette. The bride, who was met at the door by
her brother, though, 1 believe her step-father gave
her away, looked very charming in a dress of
cream satin, the train perfectly plain, the front of
the petticoat slightly veiled in lace, and the bodice
covered with very fine seed pearl embroidery, which was
so fine that it almost looked like lace. She wore a plain
tulle veil, and carried a lovely bouquet. As she drove
away after the ceremony was over the people sent up two
ringing cheers. One disagreeable incident made mo in-
dignant that there should he such people in the world.
As soon as the bride and bridegroom got into their car-
riage they pulled down the blind on one side, the window
being open. A person dressed as a lady, determined not
to he defrauded of her view, rushed forward, and miming
beside the quickly-moving carriage lifted up (he blind
and looked in! How increasingly glad, after Mint
little contretemps, the wedding party must have
been that they refused to allow anyone into
the church, though the privacy observed was also
partly due to a recent death in the Navarro family.
The church was most beautifully decorated with while
flowers and tall palms, two of which formed an arch in
front of the altar. Nearly all the flowers had been
arranged by the bride herself, who was aC work at the
the church until late the night before, with her bride-
groom to assist. The wedding breakfast, the only guest
outside the small family being the priest who married
them, took place at Mrs. Griffin’s house at 16 Frognal,
Hampstead. Soon after three the happy couple departed.
The bride wore over her brown dress a dark-blue cloth
cloak made with yoke anil cape, and a big blue hat with
blue ostrich-feathers. Poor things ! They went away in
blissful igiioranoa that on the rool of the carriage a white
sal in slipper was reclining in solitary state. It is
rumoured that the happy pair are going to Venice, but as
the bride made her friends promise not to reveal her des-
tination this must be received with a grain of salt.
Dr. Luys, the celebrated Drench physician,
hypnotises (that is t<o say, mesmerises) patients in
two minutes, by causing them to look at revolving
mirrors, and so far he has had no accident. But
it is obvious that the new power is capable of ter-
rible abuse. A patient arrives full of life, in com-
plete contact with the external world : he talks
and laughs gaily; but if we only make him fix Ins
eye on a definite object, lay our fingers lightly on
the balls of his eyes, gently press the lobe of his
ear, and make him hear a slight noise, we at once
bring him to a state of utter annihilation both as
regards Ids faculties and his motive power, lie
falls on the floor in a state of coma, thunderstruck,
so to speak, and simply lies there like an inert,
flabby, senseless mass, utterly dead to the
touch of the external world. He is no
longer his own master, and is completely
at the mercy of the hypnotiser who controls him.
We then open his eyelids, we cause a flashing
light to penetrate right into his eyes; the light
passes into his brain, and proceeds to cause
special kinds of activity and to illuminate certain
special departments of the brain. A new condi-
tion is now produced, the condition of catalepsy.
This condition is marked by the pre-eminence of
optical impressions which exercise absolute sway
over all those activities of the nervous system
which are aroused. The patient’s eyes are wide
open, fixed and motionless ; the pupil is especially
affected. His excessive power of sight reaches
such an extraordinary pitch of acuteness that if
we cover his e eli Is with a layer of cotb u
wool and i..-u put a newspaper in front
of his eyes, we are amazed to see that lie
can read it —no doubt through some tiny cracks
imperceptible to us. Suppose we show to him,
behind a wooden screen one-fifth of an inch thick,
balls of coloured glass, calculated by their colours
to arouse in him different emotions; the visual
faculty is so super-perceptive that the patient feels
through the screen the different vibrations of light,
and reacts correlatively. Show him, for example,
behind this screen a blue ball, ho will exhibit signs
of sadness; show him a yellow one, and he will be
all gaiety and hilarity; and soon. And at the
same time with this extra-physiological develop-
ment of his optic nerves, we remark that the
movements of tin 1 cutaneous teguments and of
the mucous membranes are utterly paralysed.
A man in this cataleptic condition ceases to be a
man, and becomes a machine, and a machine
which, when set in motion, develops extraordinary
force. In fact, the man becomes a machine with
springs wound up to produce any kind of move-
ment, and once started, lie may be seen to repeat
a series of actions connected with his ordinary
habits. Tims, to a patient who is accustomed to
knit, without saying a word you hand the needles
and the ball of worsted, and he sets to work at
once like a genuine machine and knits without
stopping for a moment, and without the. slightest
distraction, and can go on in the same way for six
hours consecutively, even forgetting the times for
meals. After catalepsy comes somnambulism. A
patient is no longer himself, nor connected with
any of his old ties ; he is released from his past
and dissevered from his surroundings; he passively
submits to any external impulses and willingly
accepts the most utter absurdities. He will even
abdicate his own personality and clothe himself in
the borrowed personality of any person just as the
experimenter bids him. You can stick a pin with
impunity into the skin of the patient, nip him
with pincers, burn him with a hot cautcriscr, and
still he has no sensation and remains utterly un-
aware of what is going on. He continues to talk
if questions are put to him. His mucous mem-
branes are similarly deadened. When.a hypno-
tised person awakes, he is completely oblivious
of all that has happened. His consciousness
has been completely arrested. Sometimes
they are only half awake. Hr. Luys says.:—
If, indeed, the patient, only half-awakened, is
sent back in this condition to his daily life, he has
only a half-consciousness of the nature of his acts.
He may walk straight on without knowing where
he is going, or collide with persons passing by ; he
may knock them down, steal articles exposed in
shops, commit all kinds of offences, even outrages
on decency; and this unconscious person, whom
the public and the magistrates regard as in itosses-
sion of all his senses, may find himself the object
of undeserved punishment. 1 cannot, therefore,
too earnestly warn young experimenters against
the serious consequences of an incompletely-
effected awakening.
Mr. M. C. Cowlishaw has joined the
board of the Australian Newspaper Co., which is
now stated to be a paying concern. As the
Cowlishaws are a hard-headed and proverbially
lucky family, this accession to the directorate
should bring good fortune to the Star.
The total production of wool in N.S. Wales
for the year ended June 30, 1890, was 710,970
bales. The shipments from Australia and 'N.Z.
for the past year were 1,463,000 bales, and it is
thus evident that N.S.W. »alone produces quite
one half of the wool grown in Australia.
A “ Domestic Servants’ Association ” has
been started in Melbourne. Secretary Monish
declares that, “as it is desired to secure the
confidence of employers, only fully-qualified ser-
vants will be allowed to join the Association,
The principle paraded here is radically vicious.
Setting aside the fact that standards vary as to
what “ fully-qualified ” consists in, the creation of
a privileged class of domestic servants will cause
social conditions to bear still more degradingly
and cruelly on the (supposedly) imperfect out-
siders. Mr. Morrish had better style his kitten
“The Society of Perfect Treasures.” The one
broad rule to be observed should be the admission
of all domestic servants who are willing to join for
the purposes of mutual co-operation, subject to
which let each stand on her merits. If Mr.
Morrish fancies he can solve the servant-girl
question by establishing an aristocracy of slavey-
dom, he oughtn’t to be entrusted with the
destinies of a movement whose object is or should
be the disenthralment of drudges.
Ask Yourself
Ask yourself these questions : In what condition
am I to-day ? Am 1 perfectly sound in body and
in mind? Am I strong and vigorous, and is life a
constant pleasure to me ? If you can answer these
questions affirmatively you are indeed lucky. If
you are tired, weak, weary, or despondent, you
need assistance. The trying time of the year is
approaching with its dangers to physical health.
Do not neglect a headache ; it is a sign that your
liver is deranged, and may lead to permanent
disease if not attended to. If you are troubled
with restless nights, neuralgia, indigestion, ner-
vousness, or constipation, don’t treat such positive
symptoms of approaching physical decline with
contempt, or bitterly, will yon rue your carelessness.
Such invidious foes are more dangerous and fatal
than all the wars and famines that ever eventuated.
Mr. Charles Scott, of 94 King-street, Newtown,
N.S.W., writes as under, date July 23rd I have
much pleasure in testifying to the efficiency of
Clements Tonic, in curing me of congestion of
the liver. For seven years I have suffered from
constant enlargement of the liver, which caused
me severe pain, and was due to a sedentary life
and want of exercise, my life being almost insup-
portable. I was listless and irritable, and at
times had to consult doctors, and was at one time
laid on a sick bed ; but all to no purpose. Suffer-
ing in this way for many years, I resorted to tin
use of Clements Tonic, and after the use of three
bottles the swelling of the liver was reduced, and
with its use pain disappeared. After taking five
bottles I can now eat and drink anything, and
smoke mypipewithout that continual irritable and
sleepy feeling resulting, I trust this letter will lead
similar sufferers to the use of Clements Tonic,
giving it a fair trial, not merely using one bottle,
and then discarding it, and I am satisfied they
will derive the same benefit. Mr. James Prentice,
proprietor of Newtown (N.S.W.) Chronicle, has
for some time been a most acute sufferer from livei
complaint, lassitude, indigestion, &c., due to busi
less care and close application to work. He took
.T.emexts Tonic. — For some time I have
suffered considerably from lassitude and in-
digestion, resulting from close attention to
work. To obtain relief I tried all sorts of so-
called “cures,” but found none that gave me any
ease. I was at last induced to use Clements
Tonic, and having done so, regret not having
taken it sooner. After taking only two bottles
my lassitude vanished. I was able to attend to
my duties with my usual energy, and also to relish
my food and enjoy my rest, and in a way that had
been unknown for some time. I shall always re-
commend Clements Tonic, believing that it only
requires to bo tried to bo appreciated.

tion, they are managing to find illicit stills all over

Says the Commonweal : —“ The clerical

Gillies has worked off his fifth Budget
consecutively, thus breaking the record of Vic-
torian Treasurers. People thought he would never
see a second, but he is a better Premier than

The new Melbourne Cathedral peal of
bells burst up an Unemployed meeting on an
adjacent patch the other night. At one time the
Church used to be the friend of the poor and
needy, and him that hath no helper.
A Melbourne hatter, with a wife and nine
children, shot himself dead last week, as a mild
protest against the assumption of Gillies and
Patterson that there are no unemployed. Carlyle

In the House of Commons a number of
members are waiting with 1016 amendments on
the Irish Land Purchase Bill. They want to
amend everything except the “Whereas” at the
beginning of the measure, and somebody is lying
low to further amend pretty nearly every one of
these 1016 amendments.
The £9500-worth of Italian statuary, &c.,
bought on Government account from Mr. Oscar
Meyer by Sir Henry Parkes is not all that
N.S.W. has purchased in that line during the
last few years. What has become of the statuary
or statuettes said to have been traded off to some-
one for N.S.W. Treasury money by the ingenious
Mr. Hastings Malcolm ?
The attempt to make people nominate
their religion, in the English Census, has failed.
The Bishops & Co. tried it in the Lords, but when
it failed the Archbishop of Canterbury blandly
disavowed that it was official. Yet the whole
was a paltry trick to get the unbelievers or in-
diffevents registered in the all-embracing Church
of England, and prove that Disestablishment
wasn’t wanted.
Sydney University, as at present consti-
tuted, is, it becomes increasingly plain, a Tory in-
stitution, the chief purpose whereof is to provide
Englishmen with fat billets. For a brainy Aus-
tralian to hope for promotion on its teaching staff
is madness —the utmost that can be hoped for by
an Austrahan-born scholar is a miserable lecture-
ship of £3OO or £4OO a year. Parliament should
deal with this matter with a seven-inch knife.
Crick, M.L.A., was perfectly right in
demanding a select committee to inquire into the
working of the N.S.W. Registrar-General’s
department. Thousands of pounds have lately
been stolen from that institution, and the public
have a perfect right to know all about the steal-
ing. Treasurer M‘Millan’s plea that some
alterations have taken place in the office is not
good enough. The place has for years been a den
of thieves, and ought to be publicly purged.
Ernest Twopeny, of journalistic and Ex-
hibition fame, has issued in New Zealand an
election-address which does credit to his ability as
a newspaper and show man. He caters for all.
He sweeps up Radicals of every hue, Protec-
tionists, Unionists, Socialists, Nationalism's of
land, bursters-up of the same, Catholics, Bible-in-
schools people, and the unemployed. Outside of
Twopeny’s net, says a fellow-scribe, there is
nothing left but banks, loan-companies, and
journalists.
The Inniskilling Royal Fusiliers broke out
into melody recently, and sang “ God save.*
Ireland, ’ and now they are charged with “ in-
subordination ” in consequence. Any Irishman
who is found offering a suggestion that God should
save anything except the Queen and Balfour and
Batten berg and the Tory majority in the Commons
is liable to get into difficulties in the fine and
enlightened British empire. Even if he wants to
be saved himself he is looked upon with dark
suspicion, it being an insurrectionary act for any
one to look after h-’s own soul so long as the
Government has got one to be attended to.
We regret to learn that the N.S.W. Rail'
way Commissioner will in future “ refuse to recog'
nise” the Railway and Tramway Employes
Association. No doubt it will continue to be
there just the same, but Mr. Eddy announces that
he will be ignorant of the fact, and if his eye
happens to light upon the Association, which is a
pretty large object and not easily overlooked, he
will fail to see anything, and will assume a hollow,
weary glare to intimate that he is looking at
vacancy. What we desire to know now is whether
the Association will decline to recognise Mr.
Eddy, or whether it will take cognisance of that
gentleman and step-upon him in order to draw his
attention. Also, we would mention to the Com-
missioner an instance of a man who declined to
recognise an elephant, and thereby proved the
uselessness of officially ignoring an object larger
than himself, for the elephant squashed him just
the same.
Nervous Exhaustion.
FROM THE AMERICAN RURAL HOME.
The too rapid exhaustion of nervous vitality is
the great American disease that is carrying off
thousands and tens of thousands of our race, says ■
the San Francisco News Letter. Why should /
we be more amenable to this trouble than other
people? We never hear of English or German
nervous exhaustion; yet the difficulty is one of
every day occurrence in this country, and all
around us there are victims of it. The tendency
in Europe is toward an increase of years ; men are
now living to healthier and more advanced ages
than ever before. All the great characters who
have in recent years occupied Jthe public stage,
may be taken to illustrate what we mean. Moltke,
Gladstone, and Bismarck are conspicuous examples
of vigorous minds in healthy bodies at a period of
life seldom attained in this country. The obituary
column of the London Times shows that it is the
commonest thing possible for Englishmen to live
to be eighty or ninety years old. The death
notices in our own papers seldom afford such
evidences of age. Why should there be this differ-
ence?
If a long life and a moderate enjoyment of it
were sought as the chief ends to be realised by
American men and women, there is no reason why
they should not go on reasonably and comfortably
to glorious old age. Some do. But with most of
us, we eat in too great a hurry, dine in crowds,
think “ as quick as a flash,” bother ourselves not at
all about digestion, which for that very reason is
nearly always bothering us, sleep only when we
must, and awake to renewed tumults of greed and
ambition that fret the flesh off our bones, use up
our vital force, and finally extinguish the vital
spark. That is what is the matter with the
Americans. It is hardly possible, we suppose, to
expect the restless; ambitious Americans of this
generation to practice the “Gospel of rest” ad-
vocated by Herbert Spencer. If they would,
however, but realise the fact, as many have al-
ready done, that by keeping the main purifying
organs of the system, the kidneys and liver, in
healthy working order by the use of Warner’s safe
cure there would be very little danger of a general
break down (the usual result of nervous ex-
haustion), and more people would live to green
old age with unimpaired energies.
Note. —The exigencies of life in these Austra-
lian colonies are daily becoming more akin to the
experiences expressed in the above recital of
American fast-living, and its evil influences on
the general health of the people. Therefore, the
moral to be gained therefrom cannot be too
forcibly impressed upon public attention.

thus, the mineral is made vegetable, the vegetable
animal, the animal man, and man God, but the
different stages of this evolution do not take
place on the same planet. The Hindoos say that
on our planet it is impossible that a monkey be-
come man, although his evolution takes place in
the invisible world. The mineral becomes god,
but god also becomes mineral. This change, by
the Hindoos, is called involution.

In Buddhists’ opinion, the fundamental
mysteries of Christianity are translations ©f the
ancient Hindoo religion. The Buddhist’s cate-
chism gives long details on the life of Buddha, a
life, that aside from the miracles, is similar to that
of Jesus. Morally and intellectually, Buddha
surpassed all men, and his name means illuminated
or perfect wisdom. Buddha fasted in the desert,
but he soon discovered that only by meditation can
one learn truth and wisdom. His intelligence, like
the lotus flower, bloomed into beauty, and the
four great truths were then made clear.
These truths are, first: all existence necessarily
involves pain and suffering ; second, all suffering
is caused by craving for wealth, for sensual
pleasure and for existence j third, cessation of
suffering is simultaneous with extinction of this
craving; fourth, extinction of this craving is ac-
complished by perseverance in the noble eight-fold
path—correct belief, correct thought, correct
speech, correct doctrine, correct means of exis-
tence, correct effort, correct memory, and correct
meditation.
# * *
The man who walks in this path reaches
‘Nirvana,’ the condition where change ceases,
If the authority of the Sydney Evening
News oablegrammer (who is solid in Court circles)
is to be depended on, the coining Governor of New
South Wales has already “sown his wild oats,”
having, during his Oxford career, given post-obits
covering the whole family property, which were,
however, nullified later on on appeal to the law,
and it would be absurd, therefore, to hint that he
conies out here to avoid a reaping of the inevitable
harvest. His wife, Margaret Elizabeth, eldest
daughter of the second Lord Leigh, born in 1849,
who has made her already affluent lord wealthy
with six pledges oi wifely affection and is currently
believed to be the Governor’s governor, is evidently
a woman of some intelligence, or at least of suffi-
cient mental independence to follow the lead
Of those who dare to think for themselves,
for she is said to be a Buddhist. Buddhism, the
story of whose founder, Gautama, and his Renun-
ciation is so beautifully told in Edwin Arnold’s
“Light of Asia,” has been for some time highly
popular in British aristocratic circles; and if
rumour has spoken truly concerning Lady Jersey s
belief in it, Buddhism, which may be briefly de-
scribed as the religion of eternal repose, is likely
also to become popular in Sydney, where Lord
Oarington’s cathedral yawn, and the general
drowsiness of all worshippers in all temples from
St. James’s to St. Joss’s, have to some extent
paved the way for its reception.
* * *
But, to return to our Jersey muttons. My
lord has, as we have already remarked, a shock
head of red hair, is currently asserted to be
generously - hoofed, and is altogether such a
person that his appearance at the tail-end of
any procession would not call forth any special
remarks. Possibly it is this homeliness that
has given biith to the cablegram - conveyed
fear that he will not prove a success as a
Governor, and if that official be accounted
merely an official M.C. or a social adornment in
the name of the Queen, then there may be some
grounds for this jeremiad. On the whole, how-
ever, we think that Jersey, having heaps of money
to spend, will —if he only spends it -be popular,
for beau tv is largely a thing of custom. Ideas of
beauty differ with race and country, and his
arrival will probably result in a complete reversion
of our standard of masculine good looks and hoist
the man with large feet, fiery locks, and a
thwarted-looking, ginger moustache on the very
apex of comeliness alongside the Apollo Belvidere.
The Jerseys sail for New South Wales on October
24, and “ My Lady’s ” brother, Captain Rupert
Leigh, of the 15th Hussars, comes along as aide-
de-camp—an item of news that is calculated to
make every “society” feminine hearty whether
virgin or otherwise, throb with ex-
pectation akin to torture.
# * *
Five hundred million people on this
globe are Buddhists, and in France alone there
are thirty thousand Buddhists. It is not gene-
rally known that Richard Wagner was a fervent
Buddhist. But the European thinkers do nqt'
practise the doctrines of Buddhism; that is why,a
certain young Viennese student has caused such
consternation in the church. He is ascetic, fasts,
or eats only fruits and vegetables, envelops him-
self in a hempen bag, and already treats with in-
difference physical suffering. Continuing in this
manner, he would soon be the incarnation of
Buddha, and the authorities talk of expulsion
from the University, for fear of his influence on
the other students. The practice of Buddhism is
said to cultivate a sixth sense, that in non-believers
is always latent. By this sense, one can foretell
good or bad fortune, and the meditation that calls
this sense is always physical, psychological, and
physiological. Physically, the body must obey
the mind; psychologically, all human organic
forces must be concentrated on the development
of the sixth sense—intuition ; and physiologically,
respiration must be regulated to control the
expenditure of vital force. Soon as this sixth sense
is acquired, the Buddhists are capable of knowing
nature’s secrets, and of producing phenomena tha,t
seem supernatural, but are in reality the mani-
festation of forces, very natural, but not yet
understood. Buddhism is a religion created for
the Aryan race, while Catholicism is of Semitic
origin—for this reason, the Buddhistic movement
is a fitting accompaniment to the Anti-Semitic
warfare.
# * *
Buddhism respects everything that has
life, and Buddhists believe in re-incarnation, not
in metempsvchosis; Christian missionaries have
tried to create confusion in order to prejudice
against Buddhism. The Buddhists believe that if
a rich man sin, after death he enjoys a certain
repose to repay him for the sufferings in this life,
but his punishment begins at the moment he is
obliged to again return on this or another planet.
Then his spirit enters the body of some miserable
person, and the more guilty he has been in the
frevious existence, the less chance he has in this,
n the same way a person who has led a righteous
life in a previous existence is in this re-incarnated
in the body of a rich person. There is the origin
of evil and suffering. Fifteen hundred years must
separate two re-incarnations, and the infernal
regions do not exist, as real suffering takes place
on earth. No omnipotent God interposes after
death, as, according to the law of fatality, man is
his own judge. This is called the law of Karma.
Hindoos believe in evolution, but their ideas of
evolution are very different from those of Euro-
peans ; for them, evolution stops neither with man
nor the present life.
# * *
Each human being is developed, first
physically, then intellectually, then morally,
until he becomes a Buddha, that is, a divine
being, who, after death, becomes God. The re-
incarnations continue until one becomes Buddha ;

where there is no sorrow, no suffering, where all
that relates to physical man is forgotten, obli-
terated, and where repose is perfect. As already
stated, one attains * Nirvana ’ only after having
passed through successive existences, more or less
numerous, according to the degree of wisdom
exhibited in each. Such is the Buddhist creed.

A cable message in the Melbourne Argus
states that Lady Jersey was born at Stoneleigh
Park, adjacent to the village of Stoneleigh, where
Sir Henry Parkes had his origin. We presume
this item was sent out as a warning to Parkes, so
that he might have time to gather up his infant
and his injured leg, and his unfinished poem about
Stella, and to grasp the family plate, and the
crest, and the works of those great minds that he
loves to commune with in his leisure moments,
and fly secretly in disguise by the back door before
Jersey arrives to take vengeance on him for being
born in the same parish as his wife. And if this
wasn’t the object of the message, then we would
like to know what in thunder the object of the
message was anyhow. For there doesn t seem to
be much in the cablegram as an item of news, and
even if the Argus had gone on to state that the
new Governor had once fallen down heavily in the
same public-house as Sir Samuel Griffith nobody
would have been thrilled by the intelligence.

Governor Carington considers that Gover-
nor Philip’s statue should be cast in shining brass
instead of in dull bronze. This being so, why
shouldn’t the Queen Victoria statue in King-
street, Sydney, be re-cast in glittering brass?
With what pleasure should we watch the opera-
tion of washing the old lady every morning in
oxalic acid, like a doctor’s sign !
There is a whiff of glory in a fine lady
being driven out of the Government House gates—
we mean in a carriage—and being mistaken for
Lady Carington or Lady Hopetoun. In England
the idea used to be to get mistaken for the
Princess of Wales, but now it is more agreeable to
be regarded as the Duchess of Fife. The same
woman does it —or thinks so. What’s the odds,
so long as you’re happy ?

A Wellington (N.Z.) zephyr joyfully played
old Harry the other day in a job-printing office.
The printer’s devil was carrying an armful of
pawnbroker’s tickets from the cutting-room, when
the breeze lifted a score of them and deposited
them in the gutter a couple of blocks away. One
Peggs, a funny man, saw them, took them home,
and in a fit of inspiration filled them all in with
prominent names, and then carefully dropped
them one by one in likely places—one in the bar of
a swell barmaid, another in a tram-car, one or
two in a big club, some in church, and others at a
jam-tart “ small and early.” And now the upper-
crust has any amount of small scandal to amuse
afternoon-tea’ers with, and the De Joneses firmly
believe that the De Drowns are so low down as to
have to pawn their silver spoons.

It is said that a certain distinguished lady,
who would like her “ subjects ” to style her “ Your

rabbits, so that they may be variously served up

Pitt, Son and Badgery, of Sydney, lately
sent samples of their frozen meat to Lord Mayor
Isaacs, of London. The Lord Mayor, in a
courteous reply, says that he and his friends
“found it excellent.” As we presume,that Pitt,
Son and Badgery’s mutton is not kosher, we are
afraid that Mr, Isaacs will shortly find himself in
trouble with the Rabbinical authorities.

An ex-patient complains that they boil the
eggs very hard at Cooktown Hospital. The
present writer was once breakfasting at Parra-
matta with a certain well-known seventy year-old
doctor, whose complexion is perfectly beautiful
and whose attention to his digestive apparatus
is almost a matter of notoriety. He ordered eggs
• —“hard, boiled seven minutes full,” and explained
that the longer eggs were boiled the more easily
they were assimilated, “ provided you chewed ’em
properly.” Now, what are you to believe?

Some years ago a Murrumburrah (N.S.W )
Chinaman bought a black horse out of the local
pound-yard. He put him in his paddock, and in
the night the larrikins painted him white. Seeing
a white horse in his paddock the next day, lie
turned him out, and commenced a search for his
horse. The white horse, poor animal, died from
being painted, but the Chinaman’s black horse has
never since been seen. The Bulletin i (‘com-
mends this idea to theatrical managers. The
Chinaman, however, should be made equal to the
occasion, and should, on finding his black horse
exchanged for a white one, set to work to blacken
the latter. We haven t any time to write fare s
ourselves.

The Sultan of Turkey has bestowed upon
a British Peeress his new Order of Virtue -of
the second class. If the lady remains good for a
few years more and doesn't encourage any dukes
by calling them “ naughty, naughty men,” or oast
surreptitious glances at the fine, large footman
with aspirations above h : s station—well, the
Sultan may raise her Order of Virtue into the first
class and give her a special conduct-certificate,
such as ex-Queen Isabella and charmers of her
description are bound to receive.
One of the alleged “sub-dummies, ’whose
transactions with the Premier Building Society
ran into more thousands than they either remem-

Purves missed this point.

Ernest Hutchinson, the boy-pianist, sent
“home” to complete his musical education, is
evidently working out his destiny. Pianny-play-
ing must run in the family, for a little brother and
sister give fair promise of beating Ernest in due
course. Papa Hutchinson is a blacksmith (a
musical blacksmith, apparently) down at Laverton,
one of those melancholy land-boom townships,
situated some 16 miles out of Melbourne, in which
it would seem impossible for any child to cultivate
a soul.

The coming organ for Melbourne Cathedral
hears the inscription—“ To the glory of God and
in thanksgiving for many mercies, this organ was
given, &c., by Thomas Dyer Edwardes, London.”
The many mercies referred to were abnormal r ises
in the price of Melbourne land bequeathed to the
grateful Edwardes by his late papa. The organ is,
in fact, a kind of thanksgiving for the land-boom,
which enriched Mr. E. to such an extent that he,
staggered by the exuberance of his unearned in-
crement, suggested that he ought to do something
for the Australians. Yes, really ! Whereupon
some influential party proposed a peal of bells and
organ for the Cathedral. The bells came out a
year ago, and now the organ is riding the briny
-wave per sailing vessel —an economical arrange-
ment that will delay the opening of the big taber-
nacle until close upon Christmas. The original
idea was to have everything in working order by
“ Cup” week, so that the unrepentant bookmaker
might get a national opportunity to save his souk

The prevalence of suicide in Victoria lias
inspired a Mr. Montague Solomons to write to the
Age asking why human beings can be so wicked
as to destroy their lives, when dumb animals are
content to live on. In reply to which another man
points out that many caged animals and birds
commit suicide by refusing food. The Bulletin
would further call attend n to the vast numbers
of rodents that wilfully take “Rough on Rats,”
instead of patiently bearing the ills they have, and
a bushman who happens to be by, tells us that he
once saw a fat poley bullock suicide by holding his
head under water in the Edwards river, near
Deniliquin.

THE BARON DISCOURSETH TO LADY C.
They’re sending Jersey—decent fellow, quite.
But not a member of the Prince’s set;
Had long minority, yerknow, estates all right—
The kind of man that doesn’t race or bet.
So far as I remember : I must write
And let him know what things he ought to get.
Bad place, Austwaliah is for getting things
The liquor, ’pon my honour ! ’s doosid shy ;
I often wish I had a pair of wings,
Egad ! I’d spread ’em, doncherknow, and tiy
Away to England, where, as someone sings,
They leave us still our old nobility.
One pities Jersey ; I should laugh to see
The cloud of sorrow, settle on his face :
When he’s been here, bai Jove !as long me
(Suppose one should say “ I” ui such a case).
He doesn’t dream how awful glad he 11 be
To get away from this confounded place.
But, there ! perhaps he’ll like it, doncherknow
“ Official-duty ” kind of fellow may ;
Of course, I’ve always found it horrid slow,
Because, begad ! I wasn’t built that way.
They said a taste for heavy work would grow
Tie found it grow more heavy every day.
Ah 1 well, I’m sure I’ve twied my very best
Gave football beggahs lifts, you recollect
I’ve done the civil thing to every guest,
And pushed a twuck. A chappie whos stm-
Would not shove twuoks and make himself dis-
twess't. ,
What more, yerknow, could anyone expect.
I’ll drop a line to Jersey ; yes, I must.
To tell him to ship over all his dwinks,
And not to show a symptom of disgust
Witli beastly bores who talk about those links
That bind us, and then when hanging is discuss <t,
To be as stony as the dem’d old sphinx.
And then, ha, ha ! I’ll drop a line to Wales
(He’ll hardly know me when again we meet)
I’ll tell him to expect some funny tales
About the dreadful style of our “ elite.’'’

little “toft's.” This is a safeguard in the Labour
troubles of the future. And the Militia lieu-
tenants, too, are a most upper-crust lot of young
men, inclusive of the genuine haw-haw and hee-
haw. There is a mischievous rift and gulf between
officers and men, because it costs £3O to get a
lieutenant’s outfit. Now that the bogus, English
uniform is being abolished, let these invidious dis-
tinctions be knocked out also, or enrol naught but
“ gentlemen” soldiers.

Who still survives of those who knew the
City of the Cabbage Garden in the Fifties will
doubtless remember the Royal Hotel up in Vic-
toria-street, kept by D- : , “Bully D with
the pretty daughters,” where the teams usually
halted and all the teamsters Hung the dollars about
in galore—(carriage to Beech worth was £lB5 per
ton in those balmy days) —intoxicating themselves
equally with the smiles bestowed on them with
careful na'ivete by the charming Soylla-and-Charyb-
dis-like syrens as with the snake-juice shaken from
the shilling-a-nobbler bottle. Peeping into such a
vista of the Fifties we see many of the faces we
have since known so well, and amongst them the
braw Alick Robertson, of afterday Cobb and Co.
fame, much booted, bearded, spurred, red-jumpered,
and oabbage-tree-hatted, cheek-by-jowl with Geo.
and John Whittingham, all calculating, no doubt,
their chances of getting the teams down again
before the rain sets in. Passing on to the Sixties,
we find the Royal bereft of beauty, and Alick,
John, and George made and mated in triple alli-
ance. Again we pass on to 1890. Scene : London
by gaslight, within Lord Aberdeen’s mansion
where the gay and blue-blooded throng elbows its
way into the royalty-honoured presence of the
host. The Duke of Park-lane and the Duchess
of Pimlico re-echo the praises of so fine a fellow as
our host, dontcherkuow. Our host is Alick
Robertson.

A certain Victorian farmer, tired of work,
went to bed for seven years pretending to be sick.
He refused medical aid, and accounted for his eat-
ing-power by telling his wife be had galloping
consumption. He might have been in bed to this
day had not the family gone out one night to a
dance, leaving him in charge of a man who went
to sleep. The consumptive got up and had a good
look round at the old place—the place he had not
seen for so many years—and ere his return to bed
Ids absence was discovered by the man on the
watch.

Two brothers on llendinine station
(N.S.W.) had an argument about smoking. The
non-smoker said that if his brother saved his
money instead of buying tobacco with it lie would
soon have a tidy sum put by; and as proof lie
agreed to save every week the amount his brother
spent on tobacco. In a short time he had saved
£3, with which he bought a nice heifer, and great
was his triumph over Ids wicked smoking brother.
The progeny of the heifer did not in course of
time amount to £lO9, with which he selected a
piece of land and made a fortune. In a week,
alas, the heifer died. Which tale reminds us of the
dying pauper Frenehman : “I have never smoked
in all my life, but where, O where is the fortune 1
have saved in cigars ?” There may be more nourish-
ment in cow-juice than in cigars, but there is more
fnu in cigars than in cow-jnice.
a well-Knowii comcUian lunched with the
officers at the Paddington Barracks (Sydney) the
other day. Luncheon over, the distinguished
visitor, George Leitoh, whose name we disclose
at the risk of annoying h ; m very much, was asked
to distribute the prizes at some military sports
going on in the immediate neighbourhood. “ The
Insect” consented with a piratical smile of limited
extent, but much significance, and with a well-
known surgical operator alongside to pass on to
him the names of the winners from the offi-
cial record-holder, waded in. “First prize for
running, one pound,” said he, in his most pro-
found baritone voice (running is an army-
essential), and the roaring wind carried it
away through the audience among the tree-
tops. “To Captain Murray,” whispered his
waggish friend. “Captain Murray,” said Loitch,
as an acrobatically-attired person approached at
the “hurry-up,” “I am delighted to hand you
those four crown-pieces as a token of your distin-
gu shed services and .” But here “Captain
Murray ” fled with the “oof ” to the canteen amid
a general guffaw. “ Major-General Richardson
was the next prize-winning arrival —a person
clothed in little except righteousness, and the
comedian, bowing low before that distinguished
officer, handed him 15s. and trusted to see him
and staff at his benefit. “Lord Carington
next was called for, and an individual who
if not the Baron, strikingly resembled him,
came up clothed in the dress of a stage-irishman.
“I have had the pleasure of meeting your Lord-
ship before,” said the easily-hoaxed humourist,
with some diffidence, “ but this” (handing him
four half-crowns) “is an honor 1 did not antici-
pate.” “ISlor me,” said his Lordship, with a
wink. “Yer see the t’other cove fell.” Then
George Leitoh looked round in surprise to see
“ Captain Murray” standing on his head in a c n-
spicuousposition, while “Major-General Richard-
son” was cutting a large quid off a big tobacco-
plug with a butcher’s knife, and “ Lord Caring-
ton,” half-crowns hi band, was hauling on a pair
of soldier’s pants in the back-ground. Then he
looked reproachfully at his misinformant, who
said with a grin “ That’s where you come in,” and
left suddenly to keep dark off the weather-bow
George got his names straight from head-quarters
during the rest of the distribution.

Now- there is a fancy that Gov. Hopetoun
stonewalls the Sunday opening of Melbourne
Public L brary by holding a party, or something,
on every Wednesday. This is the private mem-
bers’ night, tie- only one available for the Library
discussion, which has thus been burked three times;
# # #
“ Richard Goad, Esq.,” is placarded to tem-
perance lecture in Melbourne. Most offensive,
this. Some time back an esquire figured in a
Melbourne concert-bill, but sang odiously.
Audiences have a down on an esquire, and he
needs to be a perfect Lablacho, whereas he is
always a paltry drawing-room “ Man the life-

“No Sweating” appears on the big poster
of a Melbourne tailoring-firm, and surely this is a
sign of the times, in labour obtaining power, if
not authority. It is also au agreeable indication
that the public is learning to discriminate in its

In the recent cold snap at Melbourne, the

The altered character of tlie grand-stand

indicates levelling.

If you ask the average intellectual school-
teacher his or her opinion of official “ visitors ” he
or she will, with an air of solemn truthfulness,
tell you in one word, “nuisances.” If the school
contains some really pretty teachers “visitors”
are plentiful. There is a school not a thousand
miles from the “ City of the Plains,” in the South
Island of N.Z., where the lady-toaoher is of the
“plummy” type of build. There lives in the
village, under the spreading gum-tree a brawny
blacksmith whose chief delight is to enter the

Australia is now being largely circularised
for funds in aid of the London mission of a Mr.
F. N. Charrington (obviously a keen advertiser),
who claims to have voluntarily renounced a
quarter of a- million’s worth of shares in certain
London breweries because of his detestation of
the drink-traffic. It is as well to note that Mr,
N. Edward Charrington writes to the London
Press declaring that Mr. F. N. Charrington afore-
said never was a partner, and never owned a
shilling in either of the Charrington breweries ;
and also that the latter’s entire fortune, which ho
received from his father at die latter’s death, was
made in connection with the brewery business.

The associated doctors who are disputing
with certain Sydney suburban friendly society
lodges as to the price of medical attendance point
out that they are only asking £1 per annum
for each member—-including attendance on the
member, his wife and family, which may include
any fraction of a dozen children —while at present
the club doctors are getting but 2|d per week per
member; that in London the dispensaries get an
average of fid per week per member, and here,
where wages are much higher, the doctors’
demand must be regarded as extremely moderate.
They complain that the friendly society men,
although trades-unionists, endeavour to beat them
down to the last cent., and are offended at their
resolution to maintain decent rates of remunera-
tion for work which at times is most arduous. It
is stated that out of the 800 doctors in N.S.W.,
over GOO have already notified their intention to
support the Western Suburbs Medical Association.
The Bulletin thinks that the friendly societies
are in this matter over-reaching themselves.
Heaven help the patient who selects' his doctor on
the basis of the lowest tender !

The English clergy admit Australia is
stupendous, but doubt if it is “ sti peudious. ”
Hence the difficulty in whipping up bishops.
# * *
A pastoral staff is presented to Bishop Goe
by Sir W. J. Clarke, the wealthy pastoralbt, and
other worshippers because Bishop Thornton got
one. The staff is a bauble something like a par-
liamentary mace, and the cost something like
£l5O. Tlie whole thing is about as incongruous as
can be imagined in Australia. It unscrews into
three pieces, like a fishing-rod, so as to be toted
round.

Wo want to see an automatic machine get
so far out of order that it will supply a boy wim
a dozen packets of lollies in exchange for only one
penny. At present the defects of the machine,
whenever it is defective, appear to lie rather in
the direction of accepting a dozen pennies without
giving any lollies at all.

A lady shorthand-writer (the first) has
appeared in the Melbourne Law Courts.
# * *
An energetic Australian financial agent
has a standing advertisement in the pap -vs, in
viting two. men to call at his office and hear o
legacies which have been left them in England.
'Whether the two men ever do call seems doubtful,
but at any rate the ad. keeps the advertiser's name
before the public. He doesn't keep enquiring for
the same two men all the time ; after about a
fortnight he drops them and advertises for two
more. From this it would appear that he never
finds either of them, or else, that he finds both of
them simultaneously just in time to take their
names out and advertise for the other two, who
also have got a legacy left them in England-
anyhow, he never drops one and keeps on calling
for the other. The one reason, however, which
makes ns think lie doesn’t find them is that it
seems almost impossible to find any man, let alone
a long series of men, with names like those he
calls for. A financier who rises in cold blood and
invites Augustus Clamjenkins to wait upon him
is a person who is reckless of consequences, and it
is sheer waste of money to advertise incessantly
for Thomas Henry Jobkinsops, for there isn’t any
such person on the face of the earth, and never
will be—mot even if a dozen legacies were left him.

The Bishop of Ballarat has offered an insult
to the Y.M.G. A. which nothing but gore will ever
wipe out. He states that lie wants to have no
connection with that body “if its effects were
simply to create young females of the male sex, and
though he liked to see the youths put off, as the
Scripture said, the old man, he did not wish them
to put on the old woman.” The boneless young
person with the heavenly smile and the inch of
white sock showing between his pants and his
shoes is so mad at this that he has risen with his
umbrella in one hand and, his ■golosh in the other,
and has placed his milk and his bath-bun on the
table, in front of him, and lias asked in a small
voice fur an explanation. And if he doesn’t get it
the .chances are that he will let Ids carnal passions
loose and inform his mother about it.

Melbourne City Club Hotel, familiarly
known as “Lane’s, ’ which was written up and
drawn out in Tun Bulletin not very long ago, has
silently and without fireworks or any other emo-
tional display “changed hands.” The high
priestess and Chloe were one day missed from
their accustomed posts between the anchovy sand-
wiches and the coffee urn, and Tottie faded away
a few days after at ,11.80 p.ui., never to return.
There is now less musical and dramatic criticism
from behind the counter than of yore, and Chloe’s
disquisitions on Dickens, always finishing up with
“ Whisky, did yon say?" are but a sweet memory.
Literature, the Finn Arts, and the Public Service
heard of the departure with a moment's interest
an 1 then asked, “What's yours?" 'Twas ever
thus :
The same old drinks arc by the same old topers
swill'd,
Though with less “ intellect ” our places now' are
fill’d ;
Perhaps around our name fond memories may
twine —
And Lane's will still be known as “Lane’s,” for
Auld Lane's Ei;/n.

The respectable but tiring tow n of Geelong,
has been calmly simmering in the juice of
its own sanctity these last 80 or 40 years, content to
lose population, reputation, and every other ation,
so long as it could make a little bit of money and
save its little bit of souk Geelong, the happy
hunting ground of the large, fat parson, and the
head-quarters of the tea-and-muffin industry, is
making a move in the direction of sin and corn-
petition. The old family cow doesn’t wander at
large as freely as she did, for the march of pro-
gress is shoving her off the footpath and driving
her back into the wilderness with new villa resi-
dences. The croak of the bull frog is no longer
heard in the main streets, nor does the goat in-
vade the police-station with his old confidence.
They have a market-day now, and a new post-
office, and a fresh pump, and altogether Geelong is
becoming comparatively godless and go-ahead.

How much virtue rests in a barren title,
especially to a Melbourne society lady ! There is
a young gentleman now in that city who is haying
a fairly good time of it, having had the wit to
have his cards printed “Lord H , en

the local aristocracy is apparently unaware that
there is no.such title in existence.

Says Melbourne Evening Standard, in
condemning the system under which convicts are
placed in “irons”: —“But the spirit of the old
convict system hangs around Australian criminal
jurisprudence, and will only be got rid of by a
special and vigorous effort.” “ Yet this,” remarks
the Hamilton Spectator, “is the paper that
recently elided a half-column of frenzied shriek
for human blood with the words, ‘ Bring out the
Cat! bring out the cat!’ ”
Every Australian city has its underground

Groom’s Brighton Home for destitute boys is

Melbourne ’Erald knocks all the weird
music out of Poe’s immortal line by misquoting
it—
And,that sad, uncertain rustling of each silken purple

The hard, practical mind of the journalist natu-

hanging in front of the window, and the wonder
is that he didn’t write “purple silken curtain.”
But the dreamy bard, associating the mere ma-

And the silken, Sad, uncertain rustling of each purple
curtain.
In the shifting of one little, word is revealed the

A society of learned men is being formed
in England to preserve the Pyramids and the
Sphinx from final ruin and annihilation. For
4000 years or more those gigantic monuments of
the past looked down through the Egyptian air on
the races that howled and warred and clamoured
all around, and no pagan Vandal did them any
damage. “ But now the cultured Christian idiot
has started to carry away the pyramids piece-
meal, and to bang the ears and nose and other
features off the ancient statues with hammers, in
order that he may go home and put a broken
boulder on his mantelpiece, and label it, “Chunk
busted from the tomb of a dead philosopher,” or
“ Ear chopped off a venerable work of art.” The
British tourist would wrench the teeth out of a
live apostle sooner than not have a relic to take
with him, and his brother the American traveller
would paint a soap-advertisement on the part ot
the holy man that the other fellow had le't, and
would ask him for his autograph as well, and
finish up by selling him a wooden ham.

From all accounts, Peter Jackson nearly made
a mistake with one Edward Smith, of Denver, Col.,
whom he undertook to knock out in five rounds. It
appears that upon his return to America, Jackson was not
the abstemious Jackson he ought to have been, and faced
Smith a lot above his weight and in anything but good
trim. He smashed Smith about for three rounds, Avhen
he fell weak, and it Avas more good luck than anything
else that prevented Smith from finishing him off. Peter
recovered for the fourth round, but was unable to knock
his man out in the five rounds.

Bob Fitzsimmons, the Australian boxer, who is
expected to whip Jack Dempsey, is the nearest approach

one of his shin-bones he will assuredly cut Jack in halves.
KHz’S framework is covered with a network of muscle and

the fact that, though standing six feet in height and big-
boned at that, he is amongst the middle-weights.

At “ Sam ” Matthews’ hall on Thursday night,
young Sandy. Ross beat “Joe” Meredith after boxing ten
quick rounds. Young Ross’s dehut on metropolitan boards
naturally brings to mind the historic battles between
Sandy Ross pi-re and Larry Foley. They met first at
Hunter’s Reach, Middle Harbour. The fight was a real
rough-and-tumble, and tremendous punishment was meted
out on both sides. Next time they met at George’s River,
just near the site of the present Como Bridge, but Larry
had in the meantime developed some of the science which
he afterwards showed, and he polished Ross off. The
men’s respective admirers set them up in business —putting
Larry in a pub. and Sandy in a cab. Everyone now knows
Larry, and Sandy still drives his cab.

The Australians, after having had all the best of

for the dashing play of Charlie Bannermann, Massie,
M'Donnell, Palmer and Giffen; “The other day, in the
match between the Australians and a M.C.C. side, the
fonder, during an hour and a quarter, scored some 32
runs, or thereabouts. Well, this was awfully slow busi-
ness, and hardly what the lookers-on ‘ went out for to
see.’ As I watched the diplomatic tactics of Messrs.
Murdoch, Trott, and their colleagues, who between them
brought about this scoring result, 1 wondered to myself
how many runs such men as our Maurice Read and Gunn
would have made against the same bowling.”

Certain enthusiasts have subscribed over £IOOO
for the purpose of finding an English sculler good enough
to bring the championship to the Thames. So far their
efforts have resulted, seemingly, in putting money in
East’s pocket, a man whom Buhear can donkey-lick, and
Buhear lias literally no show with Stanhury, Kemp,
M'Lean, Brown, and, perhaps, Matterson. To produce
world-beaters you want good material; England just now
apparently hasn’t got it, and all the money prizes in the
world can’t produce what doesn’t exist. Your chubby,
“shoulder-tied,” short-armed, heavy-limbed, beer-dulled,
“ dashless ” Britisher, who was probably only half-fed
while his l)ones were growing, has no chance with the
long-armed, lithe, brisk, elastic-limbed, dashing Australian
who does easily what the other effects only with effort. If
the Britishers give £IOOO yearly for the next 100 years
they may breed a champion; meantime, the struggle is
between America and Australia, with the latter for choice.

No English jockey lias ridden halt so many

THE CABMAN WHO HAD TO BUY
HIS WIFE A NEW FROCK.
From the WOLVERHAMPTON CHROMICLE.
We have but just learned of the thrilling experi-
ence of the well-known cabman, Charles Green,
who for many years has been employed by the
Wilson Cab Company. His experience, as re-
lated below, is as interesting as it is extraordinary.
It appears that Mr. Green had occasion recently
to go out of town, remaining overnight, awl was
obliged to sleep in a damp bed, and thereby con-
tracted rheumatism in the most severe form. It
seemed to settle all over him ; he was brought
home, put to bed, and for more than eight weeks
could not move hand or foot. His agony was
such that he would scream if anyone came into
the room for fear they would touch him. His
knees were swollen to three times their natural
size. He was as near crazy as man could be, but
at the same time retained his faculties. Every-
thing was tried without benefit. In despair he
was taken to the Wolverhampton Hospital, where
he remained four weeks, at the end of which time
he was even worse than when admitted, and the
medical gentlemen who attended him at the
hospital told him that they could do nothing more
for him, that his case was hopeless, and he was
discharged as incurable. He was taken home,
where his wife persuaded him, as a last resort, to
try St. Jacob’s oil, which was procured from
Weaver’, chemist, 42 Dudley-road, Green remark-
ing at the same time, in a joking way, to his wife j
that if St. Jacobs oil cured him he would buy
her a new frock,” little expecting, however, that
he would have that pleasure. His wife then had
a double interest in curing her husband. She
applied half the contents of one bottle to his
knees, rubbing the parts vigorously for half an
hour when she left the room for a few minutes*
On returning she was surprised to hear Green say*
‘I shall have to buy a new frock, for I can turn
nyself and move my legs.” Continuing to use
this famous oil, Green commenced to improve,
and after using the contents of four bottles he was
out and on his cab in all weathers, and as well and
hearty as ever he was in his life. He was laid up
four months altogether, perfectly helpless, could
not move hand or foot. This was such an extra-
ordinary and almost unheard of cure, we deter-
mined to ascertain, if possible, what sort of thing
this St. Jacobs oil really was. We, therefore,
called upon Mr. Weaver, the chemist above
referred to, who stated at once what he knew of
Green’s case, and personally vouched for the above
statement, and stated further that, while Green’s
cure Avas perhaps the most remarkable, he knew
of numerous other extraordinary cases which had
come under his immediate attention Avhere St.
Jacobs oil had cured people of rheumatism and
neuralgia after every other means had been re-
sorted to Avithout avail. Mr. Weaver said the
sales of St. Jacobs oil Avere enormous ; people
invariably speak in the highest terms of its power
to conquer pain.
AN EXPERT’S OPINION.
gentleman writes to the Editor of the Water-
oury as follows ; “ I called on Mr. .T. E. Tucker,
jun., an expert watchmaker and engraver, who is
now with R. C. Richmond, of Glendive, Montana,
whom I had met before in St. Louis. Knowing
his hatred for the Waterbury watch, I was sur-
prised to see one of your signs, ‘ Waterbury
VYatches ’ hung in the window. Inquiry as to
this brought this in response : ‘ Yes, I have been
clown on the Waterbury watches all my life, and
I have never sold one half-dozen of them until
during the last month. My reasons for this
change are that I consider both the series ‘ J ’ and
‘Ladies’ Waterbury’ to be reliable watches. 1
have tested them carefully, honestly, and with all
the exactness that I, as a practical watch-maker
could, and I believe I do my customers justice by
selling them the Waterbury watches. I believe
the company to-day to be trustworthy friends of
the legitimate watchmaker; and I feel it to be
doing them a right, my customers a just act, and
my country a Messing, by discountenancing Swiss
watches, and selling instead the Waterburys.”
“ I have in constant use on the railroad here
nine Series ‘ J besides thirty two Rockford, Elgin,
and Waltham watches. Last month the nine
Waterburys made an average of 13.5 seconds, not
one being over 34 seconds off. The other watches
averaged 43 to 12 seconds. The Waterburys were
at a cost of odol each, the other watches from
25d0l to 125d01. We carry all kinds of watches,
but ‘ honesty is the best policy ’ always. I like
the Waterburys; they have been weighed and not
found wanting. I have decided to recommend
them, and to sell all of them I can.”

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

Melbourne'have made lightning-like progress, so will

Another tale of woman’s treachery and
guile. At the Carlton (Yic.) police-court an in-
dignant looking female swarmed into the witness-
box and swore that the dejected male trash in the
dock had gone off with an overcoat and a dog, and
had thereby left her hearth desolate ; and she
demanded gore in consequence and demanded it
in large capitals. Then the cast-off remnant
asked to be allowed to explain. He said he
wasn’t married to the bounding vision of loveliness
whose voice had just filled the court; but he sort
of cruised round the premises. She belonged to
another man, but the other man was away, and
he hung : about off and on in a friendly manner ;
dur ng his absence. She regularly lent him the
overcoat,, and he wore it till he thought it was his
own; and he was like a father to the dog. He
also humped coal for the female who had so un-
justifiably gone back on him, and now her treachery
had blighted him and he had shrivelled like - a
spider that had sat down on a red-hot shovel. He
considered that woman was a failure and that the
flying spectacle of feminine joyousness was mostly
stuffed with wool, or fluff of some kind, and that
when it wasn’t stuffed it was flat-chested and un-
interesting. He had doubts about the nair
of the whole female community, and after
the way his simple, childlike faith had been
trodden -on he wouldn’t be surprised if the
lady whom he had trusted with his fresh
young affections had a glass eye. All the
pleasant allusions of life had fallen with a dull
thud, and he could no more pick them up again
than he could balance a cataract on his ear. He
had kept the plaintiff in victuals for several
months, and had been a brother to her, also a hus-
band and a father, and an uncle from the country,
and at the very first disagreement between them
she had proceeded to sit on him in a heartless
manner. Such conduct was calculated to make
1 his hair—but just at this point the Bench dis-
charged him and cast him out into the street
because it couldn t stand his eloquence any longer,
and the plaintiff followed him out, and they
became reconciled and embraced each other
tenderly on the pavement.

Land of the Crocodile.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the late Henry Jordan was Minister
fur Lands in Queensland, he introduced a scheme
of “village settlement,” whereby settlers could
live together in a central township and fulfil con-
ditions at the same time on neighbouring selections.
Jordan wrote to official and unofficial people in
various parts of the colony to ask their opinions
on the prospects of success. Among the official
correspondents was J. Starcke, Inspector of
Northern .Surveys, a man possessed of- a complete
set of opinions entirely his own, and addicted to
expressing the same with unaffected candour, re-
gardless of consequences. Starcke was asked to
say if he thought the Russell River a suitable site
for a Village Settlement, and his report is said to
have embodied the following passage ; “ I hud
that in places like the Russsll River, one-
third of the settlers die from fever, one-
third are drowned by floods, and the other
third are eaten by the blacks. Under these
circumstances I do not think Village Settlement
is likely to be a great success !” And it gradually
dawned upon Jordan that “ under those circum-
stances” it might certainly be just as well to let
the Russell River Village Settlement stand over
in the meantime for further consideration.
# # #
And this reminds me that a surveyor once
wrote from the Johnstone River to say that “ the
blacks have stolen all my provisions and also
sampled two of my Chinamen !"
• # *
You have heard of the good-natured Rev.
William Ridley (once editor of Sydney E. News),
who published a book on “Kamilaroi” and other
dialects about 15 years ago ? Ridley, in the
delightfully unreasoning simplicity of pious en
thusiasm, used to walk in among a tribe of myalls
whose religious instruction had been previously
restricted to timber-getters’ oaths, and without
any formal notice, open out on the astonished
sons of the forest with a fragmentary and dis-
jointed lecture on the Atonement and the Fall of
Adam. Then the missionary rode away again into
dim space, seated on the ridge-pole of an eccentric
steed, that looked as if its chief diet consisted of
sida retusa and worn-out tracts, leaving the simple
myalls to dispose of the theological problem by
the intelligent remark —“My word, thafella
mitchanarree cabon —cranky
# #
Mr. Ridley once called at old Major
North’s station on the Upper Brisbane River
during sheep-washing, and preached as usual to
the station blacks. Next day he was standing on
the edge of the wash-pool observing the proceed-
ings. A tall myall was advancing trom the rear
escorting a powerful and bellicose ram. No sooner
did this intelligent animal observe the simple-
minded parson, looming large and dark on the
horizon, than all the worst traits of his nature
were stirred up from the remotest depths. Then
the “Fixed Ideas” united to make all the material
forafirst-c’asscatastrophe: an unsuspecting servant
of the Lord, a blood-thirsty ram, and an Australian
savage with the keen sense of humour peculiar to
his race. The savage released the ram, the ram
made one wild bound forward and struck the mis-
sionary in the rear with an impelling force
estimated at lialf-a-ton ; the missionary rose in a
parabolic curve and descended head-first among
the performers in the washpool, followed by an
astonished ram turning a somersault under the
impetus of his charge. And the smile which rose
to Heaven from the assembled blacks has seldom
been rivalled and probably never excelled.

Recently L met an old colonist who said
- he saw Leichhardt at Ipswich in 1843 “ a-thin,
spare man with along, serious face.” lie was
also present when Hargreaves, the gold-discoverer,
passed through Ipswich in 1852, and sold his outfit
at the Queen's Arms Hotel.

Many of your readers nave heard of
"Jimmy Morrill,” who was 17 years among the
Burdekin blacks. His real name was James
Murrells. He was a native of Malden, in Essex,
and the only final survivor of the barque Peruvian,
wrecked on the n rth coast in March, 184(i. The
survivors landed at Cape Cleveland, near Towns-
ville, and were kindly treated by the blacks, but
all died with n a couple of years except J. Murrells,
who was recovered from the, blacks in 1863. When
the first Townsville, land was sold at Bowen,
Murrells was present at the sale. Some one sug-
gested to the auctioneer to knock down a certain
allotment to him at upset price, and Murrells be-
cime the possessor for £8 10s. This allotment was
sold by “Johnny Parkes,” of Townsville, acting for
Murrells’ son,' for £lO,OOO, three years ago.
Murrells himself died on Oet. 30, 1865.

When “Jimmy Morrill” first came in to a
newly-formed station on the Burdekin River
(native name, “Mailmall”) he sang out to a
threatening hutkeeper, “Don’t shoot! I’m a
British object! ” He had nearly forgotten his
own language. There were two stockmen who
had been out on the run and shot several blacks.
These stockmen heard some, days after that
Murrells would recognise them and that they
would be arrested and charged with the murders.
Their hearts fell into their boots ! One went to
the other, and said, “ Tom ! my best brown horse
intends to be a hundred miles from here to-
morrow night! I don’t like to leave this place,
but I won t let the horse go away by himself.”
And Tom said, “All right, Charley, we were
old friends, and are not going to separate now.
I’ll go with yon !”
Under the rirrumstanns, this Pylades and
Orestes friendship was touching to behold 1

One meets people with strange experi-
ences. Mr. K. F. Burchett, council clerk at
Southport, the Brisbane watering-place*, is a
“Chevalier of Pius the Ninth,” and fought as a
lieutenant in the Pontifical Zouaves at Mentana,
Monte Libretto, Earncse and Nerola. He was
among the “Volunteers of the West” in the
Franco-Prussian War, and one of the surviving
60 from the 300 who went into that deadly
charge at Patte, near Orleans. He mounted
guard at the Pincio, in Rome, with Major Lewis^
the present governor of the Brisbane jail; and
Don Alfonso De Bourbon, brother of Don Carlos,
slept in the next bed as a private soldier, Burchett
doubtless has a great difficulty in restraining his
old-time thirst for blood, when listening' now to
the aldermanic debates, and expostulating with
clam-headed ratepayers.

A brief romance from real life. We first
behold the hero as a lawyer’s clerk, in Melbourne,
under the name of Jack H 1. Feeling a desire
for excitement and change of air he appropriated
his employer’s funds. That too amiable employer
gave him 24 hours to remove outside the city
boundary, and as far beyond as possible in the
shortest recorded time. We see him next cheeking
a consignment of Honolulu oranges on a wharf iu
San Francisco. He then looms up on the sky-line
in a solicitor’s office in London, where lie again
hankers after his employer’s cash and suddenly
vanishes once more trackless into blue immensity.
Years pass away, iu the usual manner of those
measured periods of time, and a gentleman, ac-
companied by a lady, is seen driving in a hand
some pair-horse carriage on a Queensland race-
course. One who knew him iu his early days ap-
proached and addressed him by the old name. Both
name and acquaintanceship were promptly denied.
He bore another name, was a prominent citizen, and
occupied an important public po-ition. He met
the old acquaintance next day, admitted being
identical with J.H., the ex-lawyer’s- clerk, and
implored silence on his antecedents. The silence
was granted, but his old propensity clung-to him
still, and ultimately triumphed. His final per
formance was a painful shock to the community
in which he had been trusted and honoured. He
is now serving a sentence of seven years for
forgery !

The new ‘ ‘ Sydney
Theatre, (the pro-
prietor’s first in-
tention was to name
it The Princess’s) now-
being constructed on
tlie site of the old
Academy of Music,
will comfortably seat
1000 people distri-
buted among 320
upper-circle, 500 stalls
(occupying all the
ground-floor space)
and 180 dress-circle
patent chairs, all of
the latest American
pattern with 30 inches
between each row of
seats. The stage,
exactly of the same
dimensions as the
auditorium, may be
separated from it by
a fire-proof curtain,
and is 50 feet in
depth, ; and 45 in
breadth; the pros-
cenium opening has a
width of 25 feet. The
staircases are of iron,
the entrances, there
are threeSft. in width,
of tiles laid on a con-
crete foundation, and
the building is pro-
vided with a ventilat-
ing sliding-roof. The
orchestra will be sunk
beneath the floor-level
if ter Wagnerian
fashion; ladies retir-
ing-rooms and a
gentlemen’s smoke-
room will be pro-
vided on each side of
the entrance which
faces Castlereagh-
street,and theelectric
light will be used
throughout the house.
Mr. J. F. tScholer
will own the new
theatre, Mr. E.

tect, and the first
lessee is Mr. F. E.

An Enthusiastic Blue Ribboner.
It happened, some considerable time since, that a
wild, dare-devil spirit tempted us to a ten minutes’
trip by rail on a suburban line. We were re-
clining gracefully in a corner of a first-class com-
partment, closely wrapped in our meditations (for
the air was chilly), when a long, thin, elderly
gentleman climbed—with apparent difficulty—
into the carriage, and sank into the seat imme-
diately opposite to us. A casual glance disclosed
that the stronger was rubicund and cheerful of
countenance ; and was, moreover, gazing upon us
with an earnest intentness which seemed to
denote that he was favourably impressed with our
appearance, and would like to become friendly.
But to people possessing an agreeable personnel,
such displays of affectionate interest are by no
means rare (incidentally we may remark that we
have favourably impressed scores of strangers—
sometimes to their sorrow), and we had relapsed
into our train of thought and almost forgotten the
existence of our rubicund companion, when a
cheery voice broke the silence with— “ Well, have
you been to any of these gatherings of Booth and
Glover’s ?” Mechanically we replied that our
time had been too much taken up with “ Harmy ’•
work for us to enjoy that pleasure. “Splendid
fellows,” continued the stranger, “you ought to
join us ; Glover’s a particular friend of mine, too.
I’d like to introduce you. Interested, in spite of
ourselves, by the heartiness of our elderly adviser,
we showed our teeth in token of amity, and
observing, for the first time, a bit of blue
ribbon pinned conspicuously on his coat, hazarded
the conjecture that he had “signed.” “Oh!
yes, yes ; it’s never too late to mend, you
know. Splen-did fellows! splen-did fellows !”
This principle, we observed, had been rigidly
carried out with: the garments of the old gentle-
man ; still we liked him none the worse for his
thrift. There was, too, a something genial about
his trick of dwelling on his words which encou.
raged us to inquire “ if he drank as much now as
in the old days before he was converted ?” “Oh !
the usual, the u-usual, you know,” he said, as he
offered us a pinch of snuff—“a few glasses of ale
I’m always very moderate.” Pleased and touched
by the ingenuousness of his reply, we next ven.
tured a query as to whether he had taken the
pledge immediately on his entry into the fold. A
moment afterwards we regretted our curiosity, for
this last question so evidently awakened painful
recollections in the mind of our honest old friend.
His face grew unwontedly grave, and his voice
dropped to a sad, confidential whisper. “It was
very unfortunate,” he murmured; “but directly
after signing, I was seized with a nasty, sinking
sensation here (placing a trembling hand upon his
waistcoat) “ and I had to go out at once and get a
little drop of brandy.” “Much after that?” we
qwired sympathetically. ‘ 1 Ao-o, only a glass or two
of ale —my usual, my w-usual, you know.” An
unmistakeable hiccup after the last word warned
us that the jolting of the train had acted unfavour-
ably upon the adherent of temperance principles,
and having now reached our destination (for there
had been no accident that evening) we bade him
an affectionate adieu. “Sleep over it,” said the
affectionate one, as he held our hand in his
beery grasp, “ and make up your mind to join us.
They are both splenaWd fellows.” As we walked
home, ruminating on the stranger’s words, we felt
that many of the most ardent “ tee-totallers ’ are
not so narrow-minded, after all.

Nellie Stewart's Bouquet.
The following straightforward-looking let-
ter is clipped from the columns of the Central
Australian and Bourke Telegraph. If the
facts of the case are as stated, the letter sheds a
radiant effulgence upon the manner in which
presentations to public personages are got up, it
explains fully the unexpected benevolence that
sometimes animates professional personages, and
further elucidates the manner in which the slush-
and-slobber-vendor of the “ jaynial ” order, who is
afflicted with a mania for being always before the
public, manages to attain and hold that promin-
ence :
To the Editor of the Central Australian.
Sir,—As my recent presentation at Sydney Theatre
Royal seems to have drawn forth a good deal of unfair
criticism, I think it due to my constituents and myself
that I should explain how I was drawn into this little
episode. The following are the facts:—Last Saturday
week the Honourable Daniel O’Connor, who is a friend of
Miss Nellie Stewart and Mr. Musgrove, the manager, sent
for Mr. Davis and me that he wished to see us (sic). I
was not in town, so Mr. Davis went alone. Mr. O'Connor
informed him that .Miss Nellie Stewart’s company
was to perform at the Theatre Royal next Satur-
day night, and that it would be a most grace-
ful act to present Miss Stewart with a floral
gift on behalf of the residents of Bourke as a mark of their
appreciation for her noble generosity in first giving £SO
and afterwards the proceeds of a benefit amounting to
£250 to the Bourke Flood Relief Fund. Mr. Davis in-
formed Mr. O’Connor that he would speak to his colleague,
Mr. Waddell, on Monday with reference to the matter and
see what he thought of it. On Monday I met Mr. Davis,
and in the course of conversation he mentioned what had
occurred and asked me what I thought of : the matter. I
at once said that I would not undertake the duty, and
Mr. Davis agreed with me that while It would be a graceful
act, still it was unnecessary. I thought no more about it
till next day when I got a message from Mr. O’Connor
that he wanted to see me. I called on him a few hours
after and he introduced the matter as he had done With
Mr. Davis, and pressed me to undertake the duty, men-
tioning at the same time that two leading gentlemen
whom he named would give a guinea towards buying the
present. He also informed me that all arrangements were
made and that a box would be placed at the disposal
of myself and any friend I liked to bring, free of cost.
Still disliking to undertake so delicate a duty, 1 left him
without giving any promise that I would do it. The next
day I discussed the matter with my colleague Mr. Davis ;
I would have also seen Mr. Willis but was informed that
he was away somewhere in the country. On chatting the
matter over Mr. Davis mentioned that he could not re-
main in town till Saturday night. I at once said that that
would be a good excuse to put Mr. O’Connor off what he
seemed so intent on seeing done. So I sat down and
wrote Mr. O’Connor a letter saying that Mr, Davis had to
leave town before Saturday, and that it must therefore
be postponed, thinking I would thereby put Mr. O’Connor
off altogether. I had the letter immediately sent to him.
About an hour after he again sent for me and pressed me
strongly to make the presentation, at the same time again
saying that all arrangements were made and that I had
nothing to do but to attend the theatre on Saturday night
and make the presentation and he would be there, too. I
then consented and asked what would be my share of
the cost, which Mr. O’Connor informed me. On Friday
afternoon I called to give him my cheque, but finding
he was out I wrote a few lines enclosing the cheque, &o.
On Saturday night, when I arrived at the theatre in com-
pany with my wife and some friends, one of those con-
nected with the theatre met us at the door and, on
learning my name, at once conducted me round to a box
which he said had been reserved for us, and this gentle-
man informed me that it was a floral crown which I had
to present, and that Mr. Musgrove, the manager, had all
arrangements made and would inform me when the proper
time came to make the presentation. Up to this time 1
thought that I would be asked to make the presentation
at the intermission between the acts when the light was
turned on the audience and they would not expect the
opera to be going on, and would consequently not feel
impatient at the time occupied—and this was where tne
management made a mistake in not having it so arranged.
However, a few minutes before the end of the second
act Mr. Musgrove came to me and informed me
that he had arranged that at the first fall of
the curtain I should take my place on the stage
and make the presentation when the curtain rose.
I at once realised (no notice of the presentation
being given in the programme, and my appearance on the
gav and festive scene before the act had closed) that the
audience under such circumstances would regard the
presence of a stranger with astonishment, and I accord-
ingly commenced by saying that “As the senior member
for Bourke I had much pleasure in making the presenta-
tion,” &c., &c. This was the “political allusion ” which
has drawn forth such strong condemnation from one or
two of the writers on the press who were no doubt labour-
ing under the delusion that I had undertaken the presen-
tation for my own gratification and pleasure. These are
the simple facts of my escapade. It was the first, and I can
safely say the last, time that I allowed myself to be drawn
into anything against my own inclination and judgment.
However, in justice to Mr. O’Connor, who performed a
similar act on behalf of the Bourke residents when in
Melbourne at the time of the flood, I am sure he had no
object in view but to see one of those graceful acts per-
formed for which he is so noted. In conclusion I may say
that my first appearance on the stage not having met
with the success I could have wished, I shall retire from
the profession, and a word of warning 1 may add, that
should anyone be so daring as to ever ask me to make a
similar presentation, be he the most distinguished gentle-
man in the land or not, there will be (as Artemus Ward
says) “ a burial in his family” shortly after.—Yours, fee.,
T. Waddell.— Sydney, 22nd July, 1890.

“ Art consists in seizing Nature in the act
and knowing what to choose and choosing it; the
power of selection makes the artist .” — Marik
Bashkibtsepf.
The Bulletin is startled by an anounce-
ment that the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus
company haveunsolicitedly raised their conductors’
wages 10s. a week. Timeo Danaos dona ferentes.
Seldom has Melbourne society been so
stirred to its centre as by the death of the bright
and attractive only daughter of General Tulloch,
almost snatched by the King of Terrors away
from a ball. The General is as popular as a soldier
can be in an Australian community, and seems to
have Wolseley ideas of making the force truly
national.
Of the late Matt Morgan, artist, Alfred
Trumble thus writes in the N. Y. Epoch :
To the once famous Tomahawk, of London, his wjt and
art provided the keen blade, while Arthur a’Beckett,
as editor, gave it its handle. The Tomahawk described
itself as “A Saturday Journal of Satire.” It astonished
London for theflrst time at the beginning of May, 1857.
It consisted of .eight pages of text, a cartoon and a cover,
and cost twopence. In its sixteenth issue the artist began
to use his now familiar signature. Matt Morgan. The
Tomahawk cut deep from its very beginning. In No.
■8 began the terrific attacks on the Prince of Wales, with a
double-page cartoon, showing the prince as Hamlet, on
the battlements, breaking away from the restraint of his
friends to follow the phantom of George the Fourth, with
the words, “I’ll follow thee 1” As the prince was just
then modelling his life after that of the debauchee
son of George the Third, this bold burlesque to’d
immensely. But the sensation was as nothing beside that
aroused by No. 14, where a double-page cartoon, called “A
Brown Study,” printed in black on a brown tint, displayed
the Queen’s valet, John Brown, leaning against the back
of the empty throne, with a clay-pipe in his right hand,
his left, at his hip, reaching stealthily out for the crown,
which stood in a case on a stand behind hun, and the
British lion, aroused by the threat of theft, growling as he
climbed the steps of the dais leading to the seat of power.
This fierce and savage hack at a scandal of the day, which
did not spare the Queen herself, but which her loyal sub-
jects scarcely dare discuss under their breaths, made the
whole nation shudder and buy the paper. One result of
this cartoon was that the Tomahawk got a dose of official
attention that dulled its edge to the sacred privilege of
the throne for many weeks to come.
A fascinating piece of verse appears in a
recent number of that cultured and graceful pub-
lication, the Sydney Evening News. It is en-
titled “The Rivulet,” and is signed “A Milo
Bennett ’’—-and here is a hunk of it: —
Sometimes dancing on right merrily,.
Never spreading pain or woe ;
And then again flowing surlily,
Needing sunshine, like the Po,
Men are like the little brooklet.
Onward rushing to their fate ;
Both need sunshine to endure it,
And that early not too late.
As we have never heard that Mr. Alfred Bennett,
the accomplished managing-proprietor of our
esteemed contemporary, had a Milo in his name,
we may be wrong in attributing to him the author-
ship of this charming lyric, in which case we are
open to make the frankest and most handsome of
apologies. However that may be, we are certain
Mr. Bennett is one of the very few men •in Aus-
tralia capable of penning so enthralling a set of
verses, and it is likely enough only Mr. B.’s
abnormal modesty which in this ease causes
him to suppress most of the Alfred and
to give to the Milo an unusual prominence. The
old original Mho, we happen to remember, was a
powerful man who carried a calf on the day of its
birth and thereafter carried it every day until it
became a full-grown bull, when he dashed it to
the ground and killed it with his fist; and though
Mr. Alfred Bennett may never have been seen
carrying a bull, we have known his paper to carry
from time to time a large assortment of prize
animals of that description. Again, the talented
author may, after all, turn out to be one
of the junior members of the Bennett family,
in which case we cordially felicitate Mr. Alfred
Bennett on being more or less directly con-
nected with an entity who would appear to have
in his golden youth a first mortgage at sixty per
cent., so to speak, on the proudest laurels of
poetic genius.
A Melbourne lady complains rather vio-
lently of the conduct of another lady who took
advantage of her temporary absence to call in and
die at her house. She didn’t know the other lady
at all, and she considered her conduct as dis-
courteous. No doubt this feeling is natural
enough, but still if a lady is out walking and feels
a sudden desire to die right off it is evident she
must go somewhere to do it. In the case of a
gentleman it might be reasonable enough to expect
him to go down a quiet street and die, or to pass
away on the grass in a park; but when a lady
knocks at the door and asks to be allowed to come
in and perish for a few minutes, no right-minded
person could well refuse the request. Of course, if
the visitor intends to finish off with some violent
complaint which will lead her to jump all over the
place in her last moments, and break pretty nearly
every perishable article in the house, and heave
her last sigh on top of a heap of slaughtered
furniture that cost £7O when it was new, there
might be some ground for objection; but
such cases are rare and they can be easily
diagnosfd in time, for a violent patient of this
order generally kicks the door in instead of ringing
the bell. In the majority of instances, however,
the -sufferer merely desires to sit down and breathe
the word “mother” in a minor key, and then
float away, and under such circumstances the
householder who would tell her to go and die in a
threepenny omnibus or a pastrycook’s shop, and
then slams the door, is little better than a brute.
Even if the invalid hollers a good deal in her last
fleeting respirations that is no Reason why any
Christian person should refuse to accommodate
her for a few minutes, so long as she is content to
decease in a chair and doesn’t want to overturn
the vvashstand and then wind up by calling for
brandy with her head inserted in 'the ashes under
the grate; and any quietly-disposed person, who
wishes to die either in this office or at the sub-
editor’s private residence, will always find a hard
seat, a prayer-book, and a glass of pump-water at
her disposal.
They are a slow, tranquil, drowsy race who
inhabit Christchurch (N.Z.), the City of the Plains.
When a man calls on his best girl there, he gene-
rally sits and gazes at the album for a month or
six weeks while he is making up his mind what to
say next, and when he leaves he seldom looks in
again for three years. It is quite a common thing
for a person to be grown up in Christchurch before
his friends are aware that he is born, and, as a
rule, he is dead ten years before his nearest relative
hears of it. A Christchurch citizen never loses a
train in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but
sometimes he has to hurry a good deal to catch
the train that starts a fortnight after the one he
was aiming at. It is very rarely that anything
happens over there, for any kind of event that
won’t keep is sure to go bad befcr ' it can take
place, and consequently an incident which occurred
suddenly a few weeks ago created a slight stir.
It was evening, and two fond hearts were
gathered together on a sofa. They had arranged
to be married in thirteen years or so, and
were full of blissful contentment. The pet
monkey belonging to the man next door was
sitting on the roof and combing his ear with
his hind leg, but they were not conscious of his
existence. But after a while the cat from the end
house came roaming over the tiles, and an un-
pleasantness arose between the two animals. It
ended badly, and in a few seconds the monkey
started out for the chimney and for home, but in
his excitement he escaped down the wrong flue.
A few seconds later an awful thing, all shriek and
hair and curly tail, came scrambling and sneezing
into a grate where be wasn’t expected, with a cloud
of soot following after him, and fell into the fire.
He can.e out of it again quite suddenly, though,
and did an affrighted spin round the room, clutch-
ing at the girl’s back-hair as he took a flying jump
off the small of her back and made for the side-
board. He took nearly a pound of the hair with
him, and its late owner took refuge under the
sofa. Then the young man rose solemnly and
prepared to do something in about ten days
or a fortnight in defence of his future
bride. The scared ape skimmed along the
mantelpiece, and raked down £5-worth of
ornaments, and his enemy started after him
with the velocity of an iron safe. By the time he
arrived at the mantelpiece the animal was sitting
on top of a picture at the other end of the room,
and when the picture fell it made more noise than
a panorama. Naturally enough, this put new
rapidity into the singed quadruped, and it escaped
into the interior of the sideboard, but when its
pursuer came up and turned the sideboard face
downwards on the floor to make it a prisoner, he
only reduced the contents to unspeakable chaos,
for the invader was already flying down the stair.
Nevertheless, the youth sat holding the capsized
furniture down with a firm hand for three-quarters
of an hour, till his girl took courage to come out
from under the sofa and rush gradually into her
own room to put on some more hair. Then
an affrighted wail announced that the monkey was
there also, and while the hero still held down the
overturned sideboard the animal made its final
retreat through a window carrying her best bonnet
impaled on its tail. It is characteristic of the
slowness of the slowest city on earth that oven then
the infatuated youth continued to hold on to the
ruined furniture for 48 hours longer under a firm
conviction that he had an animal of some kind
imprisoned inside, and when he found his mistake
he was so mortified that he went away and is not
expected to call again for two years. In conse-
quence of the alarm created by this incident it has
been considered advisable to postpone the wed-
ding to some date a little further on in the next
century.

Tales of “The System."
[No. IV.; Absalom Day’s Promotion.]
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sound of a bell came floating on the
pellucid atmosphere to the ears of the dense, wait-
ing crowd.
“ That ain’t the Tench clapper yet, surely ?” ex-
claimed a bleary-eyed old ticket-of-leave man
who stood in the front-rank, so close to the files of
the military guard that his noisome breath dulled
the pipe-clayed polish on the nearest private’s
shoulder-belt.
“Yer ought’r know, oP chap,” sneered an
“F.S.” (free-by-servitude) man. Yer slep’ of’n
’nuff in the ol’ lumber-yard dorm’tories.”
“Wot stoopids ye must be as not to know as
that’s the bell of the Beagle as is striking eight
bells !” broke in a third person whose assumption
of superiority, evidenced in many airs of dress
and manner, was based on the circumstance that
he was still “ free ” —a state or condition which, if
his physiognomy possessed any value as an index,
rather reflected on the vigilance of the authorities.
And then he proceeded to inform his precious
companions that the Beagle was a King’s ship, “as
was a-goin’ round the world a-takin’ soundin’s an’
a-collectin’ of shells.”
“Well,” said the T.-L. man, “th’ curipwsest
thing as they’ll see aboard of her will be this ’ere
exeewshun. ”
Which remark, though somewhat ungrammati-
cal, was certainly not far from the truth.
“ Eight bells, was it ?” continued the pass-
holder i then th’ Tench will give tongue soon.”
His bristly lips had not ceased to vibrate before
the sound they were waiting for was borne on the
aromatic mountain breeze.
“One ”
The deep, solemn tone of Trinity Church-
bell—the St. Sepulchre’s of Hobart Town-
swayed the chattering, jostling, jesting, crowd
into silence and stillness for a moment
only. Before the second toll of the pass-
ing bell reached the throng the chattering became
excited and furiotis talk, the jests more biting and
brutal, the jostling an angry struggle for a fore-
most place. The soldiers guarding the vacant
space in front of the monstrous scaffold which ran
almost the full length of the gaol-facade, were
ordered to face about and press back the surging
mass with their extended firelocks. The tolling of
the bell had communicated a passion like the mad-
ness of fever to the veins of the people. The
madness of fever, say we ? Better, the delirium
of blood-thirst. The people of Hobart Town were
about to enjoy a rare treat, and their lips were
dry for it. “ Execution Mondays ” were common
enough in the Van Diemen’s Land calendar, and
it was an exceptional day of the series when only
one doomed wretch swung off the platform and
into the Mystery which men in their ignorance
label Eternity. But it was still more exceptional
to have a round dozen of hangings on one day, at
the one hour, and in the one place. In fact, there
was nothing but a vague tradition to encourage
the notion that the event which had occasioned
the assembling of the crowd was not absolutely
unprecedented in the Island history. The circum-
stance was, anyhow, quite exceptional in the ex-
perience of the existing authorities, and they had
been in some doubt as to whether they ought not
divide the 12 condemned left for execution by the
last Court of Oyer and Terminer and General
Gaol Delivery into two batches of six each. The
desire, however, to afford to the criminal element
of the population a peculiarly “ impressive warn-
ing ” prevailed, and, accordingly, the simul-
taneous execution of the 12 was decided
upon. Moreover, it was also resolved by the
Executive Council—present, the Governor, the
Chief Justice, the Attorney-General, the Colonial
Secretary, and the Archdeacon —that the event
should be surrounded with ceremonial details of
an unusual and xieculiarly impressive kind. As
the Clerk of the Council was entering upon the
minutes the programme for the day as approved
by the august body, he paused in his work to nod
acquiescence in the opinion expressed by the
sonorous accents of the Very Reverend the Arch-
deacon. “ The terrible exemplification,” said the
dignitary, “which Your Excellency, with the
advice of your Council, has prepared, of the
majesty of the Law and the heinousness of wrong-
doing, must beneficially impress the evil-disposed
among the people.” Vandemonia could not boast
of a Bishop in those days, or else this very proper
sentiment would have fallen from episcopal lips.
It was just the sort of sentiment that the superior
ecclesiastical functionary of the colony would be
impelled to utter by the obligations of his office as
representative of Christ. The Crown, ever mind-
ful of the moral and spiritual welfare of its sub-
jects, always desired the approval of the Church.
And, as the Crown paid the Church its stipend
and allowances, the approval was never withheld.
* # •
“ Ten — eleven .”
The noise caused by the crowd did not prevent
the little group of civil and military officials which
had gathered round the entrance-gate of the gaol
and Just underneath the extremity of the gallows
to which the ladder was attached, from counting
the pulsings of the minute-bell so far. A resonant
shout drowned the twelfth stroke,
“ They are coming,” cried the crowd. “ Look,
look !”
Into Murray-street from Campbell-street turned
a grim and gristy procession. Up the hill it came
slowly—so slowly. A regimental officer marched
at the head and gave the measured pace. He
recalled to himself as he walked that once before
he had done the same thing; but then it was for a
cortege of honour; now it was one of dishonour;
and his brow compressed and his lips set hard
as he cursed the fate which had made him, an
English gentleman, the marshal of a massacre,
the leader of a felon funeral. Behind him
his guard, four deep, with bayonets fixed and
ball-cartridge rammed well home. Behind the
soldiers one, two, three carts in succession, close
beside each walking, first a file of javelin-men, and
at a distance of “ intervals ” as many warders with
loaded muskets at the “ ready.” Behind the carts
again, more soldiers and more javelin-men, and,
last of all, the Sheriff, the Under-Sheriff, and the
Gaoler.
And the carts what of them ? Each was drawn
by a horse with rusty harness and dilapidated gear,
a wisp of yarn being substituted in more than one
place for a missing strap or part of a trace. Each
was driven by a grey-clad figure on whose clothing
stood the pronged symbol which proclaimed to all
men that the creature within it was a Thing—a
Chattel—a Number—anything, rather than a man.
Four other figures were also in the cart—no, let us
bo precise—we should say, five. And yet, per-
haps. wo would not bo wrong in saying that there
were four only- The fifth other man in each
vehicle was a functionary, and such importance as
he had was the reflection of the glory encom-
passing his four companions. The crowd which
lined the streets and which blackened the hill by
the Public Offices scarcely gave a thought to him.
It was upon the four upon whom it gazed—and
gloated. The four were principals in the ensuing
drama. The fifth man in each cart was simply an
accessory, indispensable, it is true —for he was
either the chief or an assistant-executioner —but
still an accessory.
* * *
The four in each cart were the cynosure of
every eye. They had the seats of distinction, for
each sat on his own coffin.
One —again to be precise—sat on the fragments
of his. Two prisoners in the House of Correction
workshops were constantly engaged in making
coffins, and, to save trouble and inconvenience in
emergencies, the shells were made to average sizes
and uniform patterns. Consequently it happened
very frequently that a condemned man found his
coffin a trifle too small for him. The law of ave-
rages was, however, respected, and the official
accounts balanced by some other wretch finding
his a trifle too large. On this exceptional occasion,
the particular shell assigned to John Bond, No.
440, per “ Asia” (1) was not only apparently too
small for him, but was not strong enough to grant
him the poor consolation of a comfortable seat to
the spot where he was to be hanged by the neck
till dead. As he cast his huge carcase upon the
lid on entering the cart, his weight had burst one
flimsy side from its fastenings, and, the lid slip-
ping, John Bond was deposited prematurely in
his shell, or, rather, on its planks. “ Why, Jack,
you are in a hurry to get in!” laughed James
Travis, No. 2320 per “Norfolk.” Travis was
always ready-witted. He had begged for the
first pick of the coffins that morning. “ He
wished to get one,” he said, “ which would just
suit him. He liked to be comfortable :” and he
had found an opportunity to jocosely lie full length
in his narrow bed, “so as to be sure he fitted it.”
Finding the measure satisfactory, he hilariously
flung his feet into the air. “ Taste and try before
you buy, ” said he. ‘ ‘ That’s been my rule of life,
and see how successful it has made me.”
Up the hill came the procession. Most of the
condemned laughed at and waved their hands to
the crowd. Only one of the twelve sat glum and
silent on his sombre perch. This was the youngest
of the lot —Absalom Day, who had taken advan-
tage of the comparative liberty he enjoyed as a
Sheriff’s javelin-man to break into a dwelling-
house, and, failing in his endeavour to throw the
blame on another convict, had been capitally sen-
tenced.
This was only Day’s third conviction, and, con-
sequently, he was not absolutely disgusted with
life. It Was a shame, he considered, to be “ top’d
off” so young; other men were allowed to live
when they had, perhaps, 30 or 40 convictions, in-
cluding two or three “ life’’-sentences recorded
against them.
Up the hill it came. The passing-bell tolled in
the ears of the Condemned. That was rather un-
pleasant, certainly. But, then, the bright morn-
ing sunshine glanced upon them genially, and the
breeze from Mount Wellington puffed piney per-
fume into their nostrils, and the crowd cheered
them, and the atmosphere of distinction was
about them. All these things were pleasant; and,
pleasantest of all, was not Freedom waiting for
them on top of the timber platform yonder ? Why
should they grieve ? Was not the balance in their
favour ? The door to which yon dangling ropes,
when looped, would prove the key-holes, could not
open upon a chamber of greater horror than that
from which they had emerged in the glorious sun-
light of their Execution Monday. Thus, thought
the Condemned : all, except Absalom Day.
* * *
Two members of the little group of
officials before-mentioned, mounted the steps of
the scaffold in order to gain a better view of the
procession’s progress.
“ Very impressive,” said Captain Grove, of His
Majesty’s th Fusiliers to Chaplain Ford.
“ Very impressive, indeed ! ”
“ Yes,” replied the Chaplain, “it was a happy
thought of the Council to order the men to spend
their last night at the Barracks instead of in the
gaol here. It enabled the Sheriff to organise a
very impressive—ah—ceremonial, indeed. Such a
spectacle must have the best possible effect upon
the convict class. ” He took from his fob a silver
snuff-box, and, having titillated his own organ,
tendered the box to the officer. “ Have a pinch,
Captain? I need a little stimulant on these
occasions. My duty is so trying ! ”
“Just so—thanks!” sympathetically answered
Captain Grose. “ It must be, I’m sure. I don’t
like hangings myself. I prefer a platoon at twenty
paces, you know.”
“ Ah, that would be too good for some of our
men,” smiled the parson. “ But I think it’s time
I put on my surplice.” He turned to descend
when a thought struck him. He looked up.
“ By the way, Captain, do you think that beam
is strong enough ? The weight will be rather much
to-day. I wouldn’t like any scandal; it would be
most unedifying.”
To assure themselves, the Chaplain and the Cap-
tain walked along the platform and inspected the
beam.
“ I think it will do,” said Chaplain Ford, taking
a second pinch. “ Have another ?”
“I think so. Ah —thanks!” The Captain
injected some more of the pungent stuff into his
nostrils. “Very good snuff, this of yours, sir.”
“ Yes, Tandy's best. I import it myself. And,
you know,” he whispered roguishly, “it doesn’t
pay duty !”
The Captain laughed, and they descended.
Chaplain Ford put on his surplice which his
prisoner clerk -a former mayor of an English city
—had brought from the vestry of the Tench
Chapel (“ Trinity ” was so called), and went to the
corner of the square, where the soldiers were
already forcing the people to clear a passage for
the entrance of the procession.
* # #
“ I am the resurrection and the life, saith
the Lord,” began Chaplain Ford, as he led the
way to the gallows. “He that believeth on me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live. ”
The rear-guard of the soldiers closed up round
the carts. One by one the Condemned got down.
Two by two they followed Parson Ford. They
left their coffins behind them; they would not
require them again for an hour or so. By their
side walked the javelin-men. Behind them, the
Sheriff and Under-Sheriff—and the executioner
and his assistants.
At the foot of the steps, Chaplain Ford moved
aside and mumbled some more portions of the
burial service. “Halt !” called the Sheriff. The
Condemned paused. The Sheriff beckoned to the
executioner and his assistants to pass on and
make-ready. The chief hangman went into the
gaol, came out a moment later with a bundle in
his hands, and ran lightly up the steps. He
passed along the platform, forming twelve little
heaps of calico and cordage as he traversed it. The
bundle was composed of the white caps and the
pinioning-eords. The Condemned looked on. and
smiled—all except Absalom Day. He shivered.
“ The Condemned will take their station as their
names are called out,” said the Sheriff.
“ Absalom Day," said Under-Sheriff Hopewell.
Day shuffled un the steps, trembling. Assist-
ant-Executioner Sharp assisted him to mount the
last, and guided him to the farther side of the
drop, where Chief Executioner Johnson received
him into his grasp.
The others mounted as their names were called
from the dread roll —some bravely, the others
with mere bravado ; all without assistance. They
were ranged in order of age—the youngest, Day,
on the extreme right of the platform as the crowd
faced it,
A word from Johnson to his subordinates, and
the task of pinioning was commenced. The ten-
sion of the crowd freed itself by a sigh ; the actual
drama had begun; the tedious prologue was
ended.
Johnson, being an expert, had taken Nos. 6
to 12 of the Condemned to pinion. Assistants
Sharp and Muggins, being only trainees, were
allotted but three each. They bungled their
proportion of the work as it was. Johnson
pinioned his six in .half the time taken by
each of the others for his three. The crowd did
not complain, however. Once the drama had
begun, the longer its performance the more pro-
longed their pleasures.
Johnson stopped in front of the Condemned to
“cap’’them. The assistants fell back to hand
the caps to him as he wanted them.
By a singular chance, the whole of the Con-
demned were Protestants. Hence, Chaplin Ford
alone was in requisition as the moment of doom
drew nigh. He was about to mount to say a few
final words —he had seen each man in his cell early
in the morning—when the Sheriff stopped him.
“Not yet, Mr. Ford, the death-warrants have
not been read. The Under-Sheriff will now please
read the warrants.”
Under-Sheriff Hopewell stepped up and Chap-
lain Ford stepped down petulantly. How could
he, the experienced prison Chaplain, and so fami-
liarised with the proper routine by frequent
attendance on similar occasions, have made such a
blunder ? Chaplain Ford was vexed with himself.
Under-Sheriff Hopewell opened the roll of parch-
ment sheets which he had carried under his arm.
He glibly recited the preambles as though he knew
them by heart—as was, indeed, probable. By the
time a man has repeated a form a couple of hun-
dred times he should know it by heart.
For each of the warrants the preamble was the
same. The “ orders, ” of course, varied in their
terms.
Beginning, on the left hand, with the oldest
criminal, the Under-Sheriff went down the line.
To John Bond, No. 440, per Asia (1), he read
the order of the Governor for his execution. His
crime was murder. And to John M‘Kenzie, No.
8764, Elphinstone, crime ... to Charles
Argyle, No. 687, Arab (2) . . . to Edward
M‘flavin, No. 12,351, Royal Sovereign, murder ;
to Robert Smith, free, attempt to murder; to
James Travis, No. 2320, Norfolk, rendering into
tallow a sheep suspected to be stolen (he had sold
the tallow for 7s. 6d., and the skin for Is.); to
Richard Bennett, No. 9244, Lord Lyndoch, rob-
bery under arms ; to Michael. Green, free, robbery
under arms ; to Phillip Grafton, No. 12,755, Pyra-
mtis, forgery and murder of arresting constable ;
to Joseph Madden, Tory, No. 14,009, murder; to
Peter Fyfe, No. 16,150, George 111., sheep-steal-
ing : and to Absalom Day, native, burglary with
violence. To all these he read the documents of
doom.
As the last clause —
These are therefore in His Majesty’s name strictly to
charge and command you the Sheriff of his Colony and
Dependency of Van Diemen’s Land that you see the said
sentence against the said Absalom Day duly put into
execution according to the tenor hereof. And for so doing
this shall he your sufficient warrant
was read, the crowd heaved another and deeper
sigh. The drama was approaching the climax.
Under-Sheriff Hopewell finished, Chaplain Ford
took up his duty.
“Now, raymen,”hesaid loudly, “rememberwhat
I told you this morning. God will forgive yon all
your sins if you really believe on Christ. Even
for such sinners as you, there is hope. Grafton,
yon are not listening, sir.” Over the crowd, soli-
tary in the blue vault, hung a fleck of snow-white
cloud. Grafton had been gazing on it. His fancy
had traced in the fleecy outlines the profile of his
dead mother’s face. He turned at the parson’s
words.
“My dear sir,” he replied—Grafton’s “Educa-
tion ” rank in the penal records was “ C ” {“ superior”)
—“ I have heard your remarks so often that I am
tired of them—and of you. But pardon me this
time —I will not offend again. He laughed, and
the others of the condemned joined in the chorus
of derision—all except Absalom Day.
“ Silence !” cried the Sheriff. The Chaplain
descended.
Once more the Sheriff spoke. “ Men,” he asked,
“have you anything to say? Now is your last
opportunity. You, Bond?”
A thrill penetrated the crowd as Bond flung
himself on his knees, and in so doing nearly pre-
cipitated himself from the gallows, as, his hands
and legs being pinioned, he had no power to
balance himself. Assistant Muggins pulled him
to his knees with a jerk.
Bond looked up to the smiling heavens, “I
wish to say this,” he shouted, “ that I thank God
my time has come at last. I killed Morrison be-
cause I wanted to die. ”
“ So do I thank you,” exclaimed the next man.
A dreadful “Hear, hear!” broke from the lips of
almost every man forming the doomed row.”
When it came to Travis’turn to speak, he said :
“I’m glad I’m going to be hanged, I am.
But I don’t thank God, for I don’t believe there
is any God. A God would have given me a
chance, and a chance I never had—no, never. Or
if He did give me one, the police and the beaks,
and the Com’troller took it from me. That’s all
I’ve got to say. Good-bye all.” He had spoken
with a clarion-like fullness of voice that reached
the outskirts of the now silent mass. As he
uttered his farewell he made a bow of mock-
dignity. From the centre of the throng came a
loud cheer, and a timid “ God have mercy on
you !”
The scandal of these proceedings determined
the Sheriff to prevent the remainder of the Con-
demned from speaking.
He motioned the executioner to begin “cap-
Eing.” In a second the pallid visage of Absalom
►ay was shrouded. The crowd, irritated at
losing “ a last dying speech ” from Grafton, yelled
in disappointment.
Johnson took the second cap from his assistant’s
hand, and was placing it on Fyfe's head when the
boy—he was only twenty—spoke to him.
“ It’s a long time, Dick, since we met, isn't it ?
A ;' so you’ve started in the wholesale butcherin’
line, have yer? Well, as you are an ol’ pal, I don’
min’ a-paternising yer !”
Johnson threw down the cap with an oath.
“ You’re right, Pete—it is wholesale butcherin’. I
don’ min’ one or two, but a dozen !” 1 ’m d d
if I hang so many—so there, Mr. Sheriff !”
And, defiantly, and never giving a thought to
the lashes which he must have known awaited
him, lie walked off the gallows.
Really, the drama was getting unexpectedly in
teresting-—to the crowd !
* * *
Not so to the Sheriff’. To say that ho was
rprised would be to use an absurdly-mild phrase.
He was stupefied by the executioner’s declaration.
The revolt of a hangman was absolutely unprece-
dented.
“ Do you mean it, Johnson?” ho gasped, at last.
Johnson did, and said so. “I’ll give you two
hundred ! ” said the Sheriff. The Sheriff didn’t
mean shillings,' or sovereigns. He meant lashes.
There was a minute’s conference between the
Sheriff and the other civil officials, and then the
former ordered the assistant-executioner to pro-
ceed with the awful business.
“Please, sir, I can’t,” said Muggins, “ I never
assisted before.”
“ Nor 1,” said Sharp.
The, Sheriff was dangerously near his wit’s end,
“111 ’sist, sir, if yes can get some im else to
knot th’ ropes, an’ yer’ll make my ticket a
pardon,” snokc a voice from the crowd. It was
the old ticket-of-leave man who proffered his
services.
The words suggested to the Sheriff that ho
should ask for volunteers from the throng. Ho
did so. None were forthcoming except the T.L,
man.
The Sheriff grew pale with alarm. The
Governor had left town on Saturday evening on a
hunting excursion to Richmond, and he knew
that there was therefore no possibility of obtaining
a formal respital of the men till a fresh execu-
tioner could be obtained. To postpone the execu-
tion on less authority than his Excellency’s he
dare not. It would invalidate the sentences.
Neither dare he contemplate the fearful but legally
imperative alternative of hanging the men him-
self. To hang a dozen men by proxy was one
thing; to adjust nooses and pull levers with his
own shapely hands was another. And then a
thought hashed into his mind which he told his
“ lady ” at dinner that evening he regarded as a
Providential inspiration. Acting upon it he ad-
dressed Bond.
“ Bond,” he said, “ I promise you life and a free
pardon if you will hang the rest.”
A terrible second, and Bond’s answer came clear
and decisive.
“No!”
The crowd was tremulous to its margin with de-
light. This was something not in the bill!
“Will you, MTCenzie? ”
“ No! ”
“ Argyle ? ”
“No!”
“ You, M ‘Gavin ? ”
“ I’ll see you in hell first! ” said M‘Gavin.
“ Smith ? ”
“ No ! ”
“ Travis, you ?”
“ Life on such terms ? No, sir . I ain’t a sneak !”
“Bennett, you? Remember, life and freedom !”
“Bah !”
“ Green ?”
“What would my people say if they knew such
a thing of me ?”
“Grafton think, man, what you refuse !”
Grafton thought for fully a minute. He gazed
at the sky. The fleck of cloud had vanished. Then
he said
“Will you throw the permanent billet of execu-
tioner in, sir ?”
There was a note of genuine relief in the Sheriff’s
voice as he replied : “Yes, certainly.” He thought
his troubles were, ended.
“ What is the screw, sir ?”
“ Thirty pounds a year, rations, and the usual
fee for each—ah —execution. ”
“Not good enough,” sneered the reprobate,
delighted at the way in which he had excited the
Sheriff’s hopes.
Away on the Cove the sentry on the quarter-
deck of H.M.S. Beagle was roused from semi-
slumber by the mighty roar of laughte” "diich
broke from the crowd at Grafton’s reply.
“Madden —you?”
“ Mr. Madden’s compliments to the Sherni, and
he respectfully declines the honour.”
Another roar from the multitude.
The tenth man had now refused life and freedom
on the Sheriff’s terms. Before Eyfe, the eleventh,
could be asked, Absalom Day, the only one who
had been “capped,” was observed to struggle
violently, as though he were already in the con-
vulsions of death. In his contortions he nearly
threw himself over the scaffold. As it would bo
an act of inhumanity to allow Day to suffocate,
even though it was designed to break his neck
in a few minutes’ time by due course of law, the
Sheriff ordered the cap to be taken off. Muggins
obeyed, and Absalom Day looked once more upon
the world.
Barely had his ghastly face been freed before he
gasped out : “ I’ll do it, Mr. Sheriff; I’ll hang ’em,
sir, if you’ll grant me life. I don’t want freedom,
sir—only life, sir, only life !”
“ It’s my chance first, Sheriff,” said Eyfe.
Day shrieked.
“ Will you do it, Eyfe ?” asked the Sheriff.
“ Oh, sir, I ’udn’t like to take th’ billet from
poor Day ;he hankers so arter it!” laughed the
wretch. “ Let him do it.”
• * *
Eleven dangling forms, a few minutes
afterwards, testified to the fact that Absalom Day
had “done it,” and had performed his share of the
bargain.
That the Sheriff performed his may be inferred
from the following extracts from the Hobart
Town Gazette of the week following the exe-
cution :
Promotion. —Absalom Day, native, from Javelin-man,
to executioner, vice Johnson, dismissed.
Dismissal.— Richard Johnson, No. 4563, per Rodney,
from his post of executioner for disobedience of orders.
To be sent to the chain-gang at the settlement to serve
the remainder of his sentence.
The details of floggings were not gazetted,
otherwise we would be also able to read in the files
of the official paper this
By order of the Comptroller-General, Richard Johnson,
No. 4563, per Rodney, 300 lashes, for gross disobedience
of orders. Scourger, Muggins.
# * *
The first of the Civil officials to leave the
scene was Chaplain Ford. In his progress towards
St. David’s, where he was to hold a christening
service, he was stopped by an acquaintance who
wished to introduce to him a young naturalist
who was voyaging on board the Beagle.
“Proud to know you, sir,” said Parson Ford,
effusively. “ I hope we shall be able to show you
a tiling or two in this colony before you leave.”
“ I don’t doubt it,” said the immortal Charles
Darwin —for hr was the young naturalist —
who had witnessed the execution; “I have
already got some new light on a subject on which
I am theorising—the kinship of man with the
lower orders of animal life. ”
“Indeed,” said the Chaplain ; “how very in-
teresting, to be sure !”
# * #
As (Icinoiifdrating the effective manner in
which the criminal classes were impressed by the
edifying ceremony of the morning, it may be men
tioned that, the same night, an atrocious murder
was perpetrated within half-a-mile of Hobart
Town gaol. The murderer was the ticket-of-
leave man who had volunteered “to ’sist.”
