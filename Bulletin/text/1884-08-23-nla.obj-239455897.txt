Germany and Colonisation.
Followtng closely after the snarl by Prince
Bismarck respecting “the grasping policy
of Great Britain with respect to unowned
countries,” the violent anger expressed by
the press of Germany, at the annexation by
the Government of Cape Colony of the Wal-
figoh Bay district in South-Western Africa,
has a significance which should induce even
Australian Jingos to reflect. The wrath of
Germany is easily understood. Although
Bismarck has in set phrases disclaimed for
the Empire any intention of entering upon
a scheme of colonial acquisition on the
French plan, of first acquiring territory and
then endeavouring to settle it, he intimated
that the idea of colonisation on the British
plan, of making the flag follow instead
of preceding settlement, was viewed with
favour as a model for imitation. This
was tantamount to a declaration that Ger-
many was prepared to take anew departure,
rendered possible by the consolidation of the
Empire, and that, recognising the general
truth of the adage that trade follows the
flag, she preferred in the future the Father-
land so to arrange that her emigrants shall
not be lost to her and absorbed by other
nationalities. It is well understood that
that Empire has hitherto discouraged emi-
gration. The Empire in its early stage of
consolidation desired to preserve all its war
material. To Germany emigration meant
real loss of strength, and was not counter-
balanced by any compensating advantage.
Emigration, despite every restriction and
precaution, favoured elusion of the conscrip-
tion. It weakened Germany of men and
money, and it did not, as is to some extent
the case with England, return aught in in-
creased trade at home or enhanced influence
abroad.
• • •
Moreover, the United States were the chief
gainers by Germany’s less, and Bismarck
has lately been affronted by the United
States, over the Lasker incident, when Con-
gress directed the representative of the States
at Berlin to address to the German Parlia-
ment a condolence on the death of a promi-
nent political adversary of Bismarck, which
amounted to a eulogy of the deceased Herr
Lasker and his ideas, and inferentially to a
censure of Bismarck himself. It is easy to
understand that many converging and simul-
taneous causes have aroused Bismarck to
review the relation of the Empire to colo-
nisation. The bustle which we ourselves
have been making relative to the future
ownership of New Guinea and the Pacific
Archipelagos may be reckoned among these
causes. It is known that Germany, which
a few years ago declined to officially sup-
port a commercial project for acquiring
Samoa, now seems resolved to lay claim to
precedence in that group. And in pursuance
of the policy of making the flag follow trade,
Bismarck, the other day, decisively inter-
fered to snatch the territory of Angra
Pequina from the hands of Great Britain
which had just begun to open to grasp it.
The acquiesence of Eogland in that rather
rude deprival appeared to augur an epoch
of mutuality in colonisation. That is to say,
to inaugurate a term during which all the
nations desirous of extending their posses-
sions should fairly and proportionately
share “unowned territories” on the give
and take principle. But the annexation of
the Walflsch Bay tract by Cape Colony is
too obviously strategical to permit this
idea to continue. The Cape Colony lies to
the south of the new German Colony at
Angra Pequina, and dominates it. Now,
Walflsch Bay lies to the north of Angra
Pequina, and its annexation by Cape Colony
indicates beyond reasonable doubt a design
to hem in the German colony, and so pre-
vent the expansion of German territory or
German power in that quarter.
• • •
The full possible significance of the situa-
tion may be conjectured by considering the
fact that at Angra Pequina the Germans
would not be more remote from the settle-
ments of the Boers, and the districts in
which these energetic colonials are striving
to bring under their conirol by intriguing
and battling with the Zulu aboriginals, than
Sydney is from Brisbane. Then it has to be
remembered that the Boers are bitterly
Anglophobiac, and are more clo'ely allied
in race, language, and sentiment to the
Germans than to any other European people,
except the Dutch. Next consider that, con-
sequent on the death the other day of the
Prince of Orange, the succession to the
Dutch throne is opened to German disputa-
tion. Add to this, that among the Boers a
large proportion are direct descendants of
Hessian soldiers bought by England for em-
ployment in the East, and disbanded in Cape
Colony and located as military settlers on the
frontiers, whence they deliberately removed
with the declared object of escaping from
the influence of the British authority at the
Cape. Summing up all these circumstances,
reasons will be readily perceived why the
Germans may conjecture that the British
Government is deliberately taking action to
swamp German colonisation in the Angra
Pequina district, with the object of pre-
venting by anticipation a contact between
Germans and Boers, which might furnish
excuse for International complications,
should the Boers be encouraged to invite
German intervention in their disputes with
Great Britain. It is not difficult to see
how easily Boer interests and German
interests in South Africa could be made
to interlace, so that interference with
the one would involve interference with
the other. Such a combination" might
prove fatal to British supremacy in South
Africa, and certainly would seriously ham-
per the dealings of our Government with
their troublesome neighbours, Boers and
Zulus, were these enabled to appeal to
he (Lesar seated in Berlin. The matter is
brought very closely home to ourselves
by the complaint of the North German
Gazette, recently announced by cable, with
respect to the proposed annexation of New
Guinea, that the Australian Governments
have arrogantly denied the equal rights of
other European nations over the islands of
the Pacific. This is scarcely true as applied
to the public official utterances of the Aus-
tralian Governments; but it is true as applied
to the general tone of Mr. Service’s de-
spatches from Victoria, and to the tendency
of the articles published by a very large and
influential section of the Australian Press.
The Victorian Premier has evinced a bump
tiousness in disregard of the susceptibilities
of the great European Powers, which can
scarcely be explained on any other hypo-
thesis than that his mind has become nar-
rowed by provincialism. And some of
the newspapers have been arguing as though
such nations as France and Germany either
had no existence or no potency. The arro-
gance complained of by the German press
has been undeniable, and has frequently
been commented upon by The Bulletin,
as reminding us of the preposterous and ex-
ceedingly inconvenient bounce displayed by
a small boy when his big brother is at hand
to fight his battles. Then, again, there has
been the missionary pretension that where-
ever a Presbyterian or Wesleyan saint has
placed his sacred foot, the British nation has
established a political claim to be first robber
of territory. In fact, it would appear, were
one to attend' to the screechings of these
pious gentrj when their Bible-bought har-
bours and strategical positions are concerned,
that they regard the missionary’s foot as
quite an equivalent to the British flag. They
have almost invented a new national motto t
—“The Missionary’s sole: long may it wave I ”
• • •
There has been an almost total neglect of
incapacity to comprehend that, under
modern conditions, the “foreign policy” of
the British nation is not circumscribed by
the limit of a single continent, and that the
fate of the British in Egypt, for example
might be determined by events in
China; the succession to the throne of
Holland by the transactions in Angra
Pequina; or the future of Belgium by
the course of events at Madagascar.
So, also, the combinations of European
Powers and the broad results accruing from
such combinations may depend upon trans-
actions in the Pacific. For Australians to
pretend to sway the councils of the Empire,
by insisting upon the acquisitive instincts
of a Jingo section being deferred to, is too
arrogant. Besides being arrogant, it is,
according to our view, stupid and narrow.
It is certain that Australia would, at her
present stage of development, be weaker,
not stronger, were the colonies, even in
Federal unity, to take possession of New
Guinea. It is not clear, indeed, that the
Imperial Power itself would be enhanced
in these regions, even were the annexation
to be made by the mother country. The ac-
quisition would lead, in case of war—the one
case in view of which annexation is mainly
advocated—to a dissipation of national
strength. It would increase the assailable
points; and it might very well happen that
the squadron, which, under present circum-
stances, would be stationed so as to assist in
protecting the capitals of Australia, would,
under the changed circumstances, be drawn
off to cover the infant weakness of newer
settlements on the New Guinea coast. But,
apart from that, the screech of the would-
be monopolists of the Pacific is absurd.
We do not believe that it is good for
any nation to be alone—any more than it
was for man in the Garden of Eden. Were
we French, we would deny that all the wit
and genius of humanity was centred in our
race. Were we German, we would resist
the national vanity of believing that only
Germans think deeply, and work out things
thoroughly. Being British, we decline to
subscribe to the fatuous Philistinism which
would fain assert that we only are worthy
to occupy the waste places of the globe, and
to introduce savage races to life eternal, the
comforts of belief in hell, and the joys of
overproof rum.
• • •
We regard with contempt such imperti-
nences as the claims daily ventilated in the
Philistine papers, of priority of right to such
places as the New Hebrides, New Britain,
New Ireland, the Solomons, and so forth.
The S. M. Herald only last week gravely
asserted that the priority of claim to New
Britain and New Ireland was vested in
Great Britain, although but a short time
ago diplomatic interchange of notes had
been occasioned by the fact that a British
vessel in the labour-trade had burnt some

buildings attached to a German settlement on
one of these groat islands, that German sta-
tion being, so far as is known, the only
commercial lodgment at present on these
two islands, although the missionary may
be saving souls and establishing P u 1 lca
claims there. Since Bismarck has expi esse
his resolution that the might of the German
Empire shall extend to protect and sustain
all her people wherever they may establish
themselves, it is doubtful whether th
priority cf British holy men over worldly
German traders would coincide witli ns
ideas of precedence. One would think
that foreigners were either so abomin-
able In morals as to .be kept aloo
from our virtuous community at all hazards,
or so thoroughly our superiors in arms that
young and comparatively small colonies of
Their people In this hemisphere, although
actually as remote from us as Greenland is
from Spain, or (say) at worst, as France is
from England, would keep us in terror. t or
our part, we should notregard such colonies
as terrible, and would think it possible tha t
from them our own settlers might, by inter-
change of ideas and friendly traffic, learn
much that would be of value in material
processes of industry. Besides which, en-
largement of ideas would surely follow en-
largement of communication, unless it be
maintained that all that is best and truest is
the exclusive possession of Britons, and that
“foreigners” can teach us nothing wot th
knowing.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Stout-hearted Philanthropy.
The Directors of the Benevolent Asylum were
in a desperate hurry to terminate the discussion
opened by Mr. Abigail with reference to the bar-
maid question, when it took a turn unexpectedly
adverse to their prejudices. Dr. Warren had
denied that the proportion of unwedded mothers
among those who had enjoyed the hospitality ol
the institution was as great of “ barmaids ” as had
been alleged. The obvious intention of the Direc-
tors had been to confound Dr. Warren with sta-
tistics, and to bring him to humble confession of
error. But the tables were turned upon them most
effectively, as Dr. Warren was able to show, by
reference to the books of the institution, that in a
given period there had been about twice as many
young women waitresses from the Coffee Palaces
troubled with illicit maternity as there had been
of girls from public-houses. This was a crusher
for several of Dr. Warren’s most active and
eager censors, as these gentlemen were themselves
directors or promoters of the Coffee Palaces. The
discussion was brought to a rapid and untimely
conclusion, just when it began to promise interest-
ing and valuable information not heretofore
available. But the fact is that the Coffee Palaces
are tender subjects with certain “ stout-hearted
philanthropists,” as the Echo used to term the pro-
prietors of the Coffee Palaces. These institutions
have not paid. And, when their unprofitable
nature became unmistakable, “ stout-hearted
philanthropy” fizzled out. One Palace has been
sold to a publican, and the other has been ottered
for sale. Stout-hearted philanthropy seems to re-
quire ten per cent, to keep it in condition.
Champion and Ex-Champion.
Edward Hanlan has taken his beating like a true
mao. Nothing so tries the metal of a man’s nature
as adversity. It was comparatively easy to be
cheery and generous as Champion. Hanlan, as
champion, was cheery and genial in the highest
degree; and, in the matter of generosity, was as
large-minded as any champion is likely to be, con-
sidering that, in these da> s, the position nas a big
money value. When his defeat was fresh, the
town was full of the ruinours-usual on such occa-
ions-of jobbery ana fraud. The meeting of the
present and the ex-champion on Monday night has
setall'thatatrest, and wo may say that had Hanlan
been a party to a swindle on the public, his coun.
tenance would have been the most deluding one
that ever came under our observation. Candour
and honesty are stamped on every feature. How-
ever, all doubts on that head are now dispelled.
Hanlan was beaten, and we conceive that, as a
beaten champion, he has won fresh laurels as a
man. Judging by the report of what passed attho
meeting, he was not spared by the hangers-on of
Beach the mortifications proceeding from vulgar
affronts. The alteration in his status as a sculler
was rubbed in with domineering roughness by
more than one of Beach’s men; and it is very
creditable to Beach himself that he took so small
a part in flouting his defeated but gallant
adversary. There was scarcely a whimper from
Hanlan during all the baiting he received. His
single lapse—the reference to the obstruction by
the Tomki, Beach’s steamer—was excusable.
Every allowance must be made when the magni-
tude of Hanlan’s loss is considered. The Cham-
pionship was his fortune-a splendid property,
yielding him an income independent of what can
be earned by actual matches. His position is that
of Mario after losing his voice. The attraction
may be recoverable, but, meanwhile, the enjoy-
ment of possession and the means of a superior
livelihood have quitted him. Now he knows his
fate. For six months Beach has resolved to reap
the fruits of his victory. This is but fair. Although
to Hanlan it may at the first blush have appeared
hard measure, on reflection he will remember that
he was not himself an easy champion to bring to a
match. The money terms he imposed were nearly
prohibitive, and placed the goHen prize he held
almost out of reach of competitors who were
without wealthy supporters. He has experienced
the fortune of war, and the more gallantly and un-
complainingly he accepts the position, the better
record he will leave.

Shakspeare on John Davies.
The following are the passages from the lecture
delivered by Gerald Massey, the references in
which to John Davies occasioned so much merri-
ment among the audience in Sydney :
The most amusing of Shakspeare's replies, how-
ever, are those relating to old John Davies. .....
In the person of Menenius in “ Coriolanus,” Shak-
speare smites him ti.us:—“ I am known to be a
humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of
hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tyber in it;
said to be something imperfect (in favouring the
thirst company); hasty and tinder-like upon too
tiivial motion. What I think I utter, and spend
my malice in my breath, &c. ... if you see
this in the “Map of my Microcosm,’’follows it that
I am known well, enough, too ?” What harm can
your blsson conspectuities glean out of this char-
acter, If I be known well enough, too ?” Nearly
the exact words spoken by Menenius on hear-
ing of Coriolanus's return are “ Take may cap,
Jupiter, and 1 thank Thee;” and in Davies's greet-
mg to the Earl of Southampton on his return from
prison he had said “ Southampton, up thy cap to
Heaven fling.” This is not all. I have now to
suggest a still more startling identification. \ on
will remember that John Davies was a school-
master. He published a book called “ The Writing
Master.” He was a wonderful caligraphist, “thrice
fatnoused for rarity,” says Nicholas Deeble. He
challenged all England to contest the palm for
penmanship, and one of his admirers challenges
the whole world on his behalf. He appears to
have taught one-half the nobility to write, and on
the strength of that, solicited the other half to read
his writings. Mindyou, poor John Davies does not
concern me in the least on his own account. I am |
only interested in tracing the footprints of Shak-
speare, and one of these happens to be stamped on
the back of Davies -that is all! In his “Paper's
Complaint,” which is full of tortured conceits,
chiefly personal to himself, Davies’
groat complaint is some injury received from
a playwright who has publicly put him to con-
fusion and shame, and ho regrets that
“ Poets, if they last, can hurt with ease
(Incurably) their foes which them displeas ?.
Again, he says, “ a great torment in the life to
come is due to those that can and will take such
immortal revenge for any mortal injury. He
tells us that he penned his “ Scourge of Folly ” be-
cause he had been “disgraced with fell disasters.”
“Alas!
That e’er this dotard made me such an asa,
and that in such a thing
We call a chronicle, so on me bring
A world of shame. A shame upon them all
that make mine injuries historical,
To wear out time; that ever, without end,
My shame may last, without some one it -lend.
And if a senseless creature, as i am,
And so am made by th o se whom thus I blame,
My judgment give, from those that know it well,
His notes tor art and judgment doth excel.
Well fare thee, man of art, and world of wit,
That by supremest mercy livest yet!
My explanation of this is, that John Davies hacl
been pUloried, staged, propertied, and made the
most amazinp ass of in the character of Malvollo,
in the play of “ Twelfth Night For Monsieur
Malvolio, let me alone with him: if Ido not gull
him into a nay word and make him a common re-
creation, do not think I have wit enough to lie
straight in my bod.” Shakspeara did not bite his
ip there for nothing! We are “ rallers ” and
“zanies,” are we? “I protest,” says Malvolio, “I
take those wise men that crow so at these set kind
of fools, no better than the fools’ zanies!” No
envious allusion, let us hope, on account of the
poet’s noble patrons who “spent their time in
seeing plays.” To be sure, Davies’s lines happen to
be charged with that feeling. And what a blythe-
spirited, sweet-blooded reply this draws from
the happy, cordial heart of the man himself
“ O you are «ick of self-love, Malvolio. and
taste with a distempered appetite. To be gene-
rous. guiltless, and of free disposition, is to
take these things for birdbolts that you deem can-
non bullets. There is no slander in an allowed tool,
thougn he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a
Known discreet man, though he do nothing but re-
prove ” 1 will only remark here that the fool in
the play cannot be the “ known discreet man, ’but
we may divine who was. Davies was a Vardan;
but “ dost thou think because thou art virtuous
there shall be no more cakes and ale?” “Marry,
sir, sometimes he is a kind ot Puritan. "he
devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly
but a time-pleaser: an atfectioned ass. that cons
state without book, and utters it by great swarths:
the best persuaded of himself, so crammed, as he
thinks, with excellencies, that it is his ground of
faith that all that look on him love.” lew will
know how true that is ot Davies, for tew will ever
read his works; but a sufficient peep at him may
be got as be stands before the mirror of himself in
his dedications—
“ Practising behaviour to his own shadow.”
Here we have the “ aff ectioned ass” that Davies
says the dotard , Malvolio, had made of him! Then
Davies complains that the chronicler had spotted
him with a “ medley of moti.ey livkhy.” No-
thing could more surely characterise the dress in
which the fool got his dressing -yellow stockinged,
and cross-gartered most villainously. Next, Davies
was the great master of writing on parchment, t.e.,
sheepskin; the “niggardly, rascally sheep-biter;
the great professor or caligraphy,—
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.”
We saw how. with the air of a connoisseur, he
studied the shape of my lady’s letters. “ These be
her very C’s, her XT's, and uer T s; and thus makes
she her great P’s.” " Her C’s, her IT s, and her T s;
why that?” asks Sir Andrew. “Ah, mocker,
that's tne dog’s ’’ profession. Then, he “ looks like
a pedant that keeps a school V the church. * No
doubt of it: he was a schoolmaster; and he puts
himself into a trick of singularity, as God knows
John Davies did. It is with him as the “very true
sonnet is : please one, please all *—whicb, it 1
riahtly recollect, is an allusion to a refrain of one
of Davies's. Thus was Davies made the “ most
notorious geek and gull that e'er invention played
on;” thus the
“ Lucrece knife
With bloodless stroke ”
was driven home: “the impressure her Lucrece,
with which she uses to seal;” and if he was not
phlebotomised by the stroke, he was Bottom-ised
all over; his ass-hood made permanent for ever.
It has long 1 been known that certain articles of
food, when eaten at bed-time, will produce night-
mare. A popnlar preacher once confessed in the
pulpit that after an orgie of mlnce-ple he had fre-
quently seen spectres at the foot of his bed; and
even intelligent persons have been visited with
terrible midnight visions after over-indulgence in
lobsters. It has remained for a learned physician
to establish the fact that not only can nightmare
be produced at will by means of mince-pie, but
that certain drugs will infallibly produce certain
visions. Re has put up in bottles various prepara-
tions for the production of midnight spectres, and
promises that it his directions are followed failure
will be impossible. A course of experiments made
upon the office boy by the physician soon con-
vinced him that lobsterine—the alkaloid principle
of lobster—when taken in doses of from one to
four grains, produced the vision of a large German
sitting on the patient’s chest, and that six drops of
the mother tincture of mince-pie produced the
vision of a long-haired male ghost. He then ex-
tended his researches until he has now ascertained
how to produce no less than twenty-live distinct
ghosts, and will, In time, probably place double the
number of ghost-producers in the market. Thanks
to the physician’s discovery, anyone can, at the
rate of thirteenpencs halfpenny per bottle, supply
himself with twenty-five assorted ghosts. There
is bottle No. 1, which produces a beautiful female
ghost with a sad, sweet smile, and an evidently
benevolent disposition. The ghost is admirably
suited for nervous people and young children, and
has proved very soothing to over-worked men and
timid women. Bottle No. 3 produces the large
German spectre hitherto associated with lobster.
A peculiarly frightful spectre, described in the
directions accompanying bottle No. 8 as a “ blonde
ghost in a blue corset cover," is recommended to
persons anxious for excitement.
It seems, from an article written in an
English magazine by Sutherland Edwards, that
drawing-room dances originated in France, whence
they have spread over the world. Kichelieu, the
stately cardinal, was a great dancer. But the
dancing in those days had more grace than is seen
in the average ball-room of to-d ;y. Before people
got up to dance, they learned how to do it. Booms
w«re not filled with rough youths who hopped
about like hod-bearers. There was something
regal in the grand air with which the courtiers
stepped through the minuet. “ Stopping ” has
almost disappeared now; the modern youth seems
to think it good form to be above all such trifles as
correctness of grace or movement. Instead, there
are too often seen, either leg-antics suggestive of
the football field, or the slovenliness of the faint
dude. The minuet, rendered famous by Louis le
Grand, was the favourite dance through the reign
ot three kings, until the outbreak of the Revolu-
tion. Dancing, then, was carried to such refine-
ment as to be called the fourth of the fine arts.
The ravotte followed liter on, and came into
favour through being danced at court by Marie
Antoinette. The gavotte is danced in two-four
time, thus differing from the minuet, which is in
the three-four rhythm, and the two were often
joined together under the name of minuet de la
cour. Bound dances are of much later origin, the
quadrille being for many years the favourite
dance in England. It is from the old Engli-h
country dance, but was a; first done in double
lines, and it was a French teacher who invented
the square form. Now, curiously enough, the
square is the ordinary form, and it is the double
lines which are called the Parisian. The polka,
though credited as the invention of a Hungarian
nobleman, is an adaptation of a Polish peasants’
dance, the krakoviak, aid when first introduced
was a great rage, with its novel rhythm and lively
stop. Its adapter died only some three years
ago. The polonaise march is also from Poland,
with its angularities smoothed off ; it is now
merely a sedate walk ronnd. The mazurka,
likewise, is a national favourite with the Poles,
who dance it with a spirit and vigour which al-
most raise it to the level of a war dance. The
waltz, though introduced to England, amid much
bitter opposition, at the commencement of this cen-
tury, is on«of the oldest dances known. France and
Germany both claim it, and this is the reason, in.
deed, of the double spelling constantly seen —
"waltz” and "valse.” According to the French
view, it was danced in their country under the
name vnlta seven hundred years ago, and the name
corrupted to waltzer in Germany subsequently.
As, however, the verb waltzen means “to turn.”
it seems improbable that the Germans would have
to go to France for a name. It was very different
seventy years ago, when stigmatised by Byrun as
a dance that "wakes to wantonness the willing
limbs,”from whatitls now—the queenof drawing-
room dances. Then, with so much suspicion was
It regarded, that many girls who danced every-
thing else would never waltz. Now, many girls
will dance nothing but the waltz. There are still
objections raised to It in soms quarters, but it may
be safely said that if there is any impropriety in the
dance at all, it is, not in the waltz itself when
properly done, but in the clumsiness and lack of
taste shown by those who travesty a graceful
art. The beautiful iteration of its flowing time
has seemed to exercise some fa cmation over
musical composers, the greatest ot whom have not
disdained to write waltz music. No other dance
has evoked such sweet and living raelodus. Weber,
Offenbach, Beethoven, Gung'l, Donizetti, Verdi,
and Gounod are only a few of the great masters
who have written waltzes—not all, however, dance-
able. They are a speciality of Chopi ■. Most waltz
music has come from Vienna, where no good com-
position would fall unappreciated; and for over
half a century all Europe has danced continually
to waltzes by the Strauss family. Venzano is
believed to have first written vocal waltzes, which
form of music has become so extremely popular
within the last few years. Much is said at present
about “ the new waltz,” and novel steps are spoken
of under all kinds of mysterious names. There is
nothing no w under the chandelier. There is only
one key step, and, after that, the greatest change
there can be is only a difference of accent. Fashion
dictates these minor changes in the accentuation
of the waltz, as in the figures of the quadrille,
perhaps a little puzzling at first sight; but there is
no difficulty that cannot be mastered by any one
who has learned the rhythm of dancing.

Some of the British journals are imitating
the tone of our own Bulletin in the way of plain
speaking. Just listen to how one of the most
influential newspapers in L ,ndon Hatters the aris-
tocracy of England“ Apropos to great landlords,
*t least 90 per cent, of the House of Lor la came by
their lands dishonestly. They neither toiled nor
spun for their broad acres and castles. The British
acreocracy, who have been called ‘huge caterpillars
feeding upon the foliage, and leaving nothing but
a skeleton leaf,’ are the descendants of mediaeval
land-grabbers. The largest proportion of them
have title deeds going back to Queen Victoria’s
lineal ancestor, the Norman bastard, who, in the
year 108tl parcelled out England and Wales among
his robber companions. They hold the land to-day
by the might of the conquest. Before those thiev-
ing hordes settled in the British Isles, and made
the Saxon a ‘villein” to aliens, the native in-
habitants held their lands in common. The
land was almost as free as the light and
air which God has given us.” Yet the
toadies of the Melbourne Andes tell us that the
people of England are intensely loyal, and even go
so far as to take Judge Williams to task for hi a
shrewd estimate of the drift of public opinion in
Great Britain. Bab! Perdition is full of such
lickspittles.
We flatter ourselves we are civilised. Are
we? Well-leaving out the peculiar system of ec-
c esiastical trade, from the millionaire bishop to
the vulgar Salvationist, supposed to represent the
Christian religion; leaving out the ideas of honesty
peculiar to merchants of this our day; leaving out
of sight the building of our unsavoury towns,
where human beings huddle in piggeries, and
everything that is savage is bred; leaving out our
law courts, as an altogether too ridic flous travesty
of supposed justice—let us take just one look at
“ Society ” only, and see how civilised it is. Kuled
by the Irresponsible tyrant, Fashion, neither com-
fort nor health has a word to say. Men, affecting
to laugh at women, wear high, stiff collars, that
choke and chafe the neck, and are odiously ugly;
they stuff their bodies into breast-contracting
waistcoats, in which they cannot draw a hearty
breath; they cram their feet into pointed-toed
boots, and they wear hats always eminently unsuit-
able to the country’s climate: in fact, a large pro-
portion of them are poor, foolish dudes. Women,
in spite of all the raving about their corsets, are
no worse than man in his waistcoat, strapped across
the chest; but at ball or opera they see nothing
curious in appearing in a state of semi-nudity
which would be indecent in the street, and is a
source of pious horror when practised by their sex
a shade darker in distant islands; they totter along
in high-heeled, stub-troad boots; and to millinery
they are senseless slaves, for there is neither
nature nor art in most of the modiste’s creations.
Her highest efforts of genius are directed to some
elaborate method of sewing one bit of satin or
velvet on to another bit on some plan that is
entirely unintelligible and has neither loading line
nor rational idea. This love of showlness is simply
our translation of the savage’s delight in rag gran-
deur and gaudy colours. Toere is no essential dif-
ference between the two. And what is scc’ety
hospitality? Is it the giving, with an open and
generous heart, to those who are really in want?
Nonsense. A dinner or a party is the mere dis-
charging of a social obligation, and done perforce
or it is an opportunity for the giver to display her
wealth and fo ly; or an attempt to edge her way
into the gilded circle above. No one who gives a
party thinks of the good it wi’l do her guests -but
what it will do for herself. It is meant to reflect
credit and renown on the giver. What are ball-
rooms ? An assemblage of s id and sombre-looking
men, many of them actually ourang-outangish in
the ungracefulness of their antics, and naked
shouldered, check painted, and padded-all-over
women, who hold each other in their arms in an
unhealthy atmosphere, and jump about to music
that has no reason or meaning in it. Of course
that sounds a brutal description to us who
are used to those scenes, but how else would
an intelligent “savage” describe it? It is just
as (rue a« our <»wn descriptions of the “benightet
heathen.” Our marriages, what are they ? We do
not beat tom-toms and summon the tribes to see
a bride sold; but the b ides, nevertheless arc sold.
Girls are assigned to men they do not love, and
men pass by good and unassuming girls to hunt
up “money,” and then sell their manhood for it;
while a sleek bishop will unctuously raise his white
hands an-1 call on heaven to bless such m.ckerles
of holy wedlock. The healthy are mated with the
diseased, the scrofulous are joined to the con;
sumptlve, ani neither t v .e mental, physical, nor
moral growth of the future family is for one
moment considered. Diseased children are per-
petuated lor private ends, and no one steps in to
stay such unholy deeds. And when we die, our
relatives are fooled and swindled by rascally
undertaken, our wealth is pounced on by lega*
carrion, and our corpses are bur:ed in a way that
for health, common sense, and cleanliness, is in-
f.rlor to aim. at any savage method of disposing
of the dead. No! we are not civilised yet.

that Gayarre, the celebrated Spanish tenor, can

Herr Most, the editor of the Freheit,

for a stockowner to go within cooey of the place

The Queen is now in a confirmed and
chronic condition of mourning. When she tra-
velled lately from Balmoral to Windsor, no one
was admitted to the stations where the Royal
trains stopped but indispensable officials. When
she was coming home from Darmstadt, the stations
at Bonn, Coblenz, and other places at which the
train was to stop, were most elaborately decorated
with flags and evergreens, and there were many
people with large bouquets of flowers. But the
blinds of the Queen’s saloon were pulled down
sharply as the trains entered the stations.
Tumut Tommy is not a prophet in bis own
electorate. A local scribe calls him “a promising
young man whose soul soars high above the paltry
affairs of the district he is supposed to represent.”
This is withering scorn, indeed. Evidently the
people of Tumut do not consider that the credit
of having launched Tommy on the glittering
career which is now unfolding Itself to him is
sufficient recompense for the haughty neglect dis-
played by that hopeful young statesman with re-
gard to local wants—such as roads and bridges, and
other sordid things. But your country electors
were always grovellers.
Herman Sehunke, of Adelaide, was in a
train, handcuffed and in charge of a bailiff, and
lumped out whilst going at full speed, and cannot

What, go to gaol for paltry debt ?
No; others may who’re funky;
But not no gaol for me, you bet—
No, not for Herman Sehunke.

It was in the Nooze some time ago. Row-

assurance that one of these days he will be whirle
away, like Elijah, in a fiery van to everlasting
glory as the first editor who ever offered sufficient

tombstone will be enough to make hl8

ordered that her dead son’s aesire should be car-

It seems that Roderick Mackensie Chisolm
Matheson, son of Sir Alexander Matheson, has
been raising money in London by the not uncom-
mon method of getting diamond bracelets and
“ popping ” them. For this R.M.C.M. was brought
up at the Hammersmith Police Court, and—dis-
charged. The only reason that Roderick escaped a
good long lumbering seemed to be because—we
quote the magistrate—“tho defendant was an un-
fortunate young man, who had been leading an
extravagant and reckless life. The complainant,
from his own admissions, was a witness unworthy
of belief. By coming into a criminal court it was
trying to put on the last screw on the family and
relations of the young man. He dismissed the
summons.” Poor unfortunate young man!

Kraszewski, a darling of Poland, novelist,
poet, historian, dramatist, journalist, musician,
painter, was born in Warsaw in 1813; educated at
Wilna University; in '30 condemned to death for
rebellion against the veneered Tartar; sentence
commuted to military service for life in the Cau-
casus; pardoned in ’32; set to work to write Polish
romances in Polish; wrote 300 of them; won a
silver chaplet from the Academy of Sciences at
Cracow, into the leaves of which were woven the
names of his chief works, and a r eap of orders,
decorations, etc., besides; won, also, from an en-
thusiastic cobbler, a pair of boots, on the sides
whereof were worked in blue silk the “snob’s’
favourites among Kraszewski’s works; edited the
Gazette Polska (Warsaw) for awhile ’60-63, in the
latter of which years he was banished; went to
Dresden, and there took up his residence. His
novels represent only one side of his literary
activity. Journalism, poety, history, philosophy,
the drama, archfeology, social and political eco-
nemy, and a nozen other subjects have engaged
his pen. He criticised, in the order of their ap-
pearance, nearly all European works of note; fol-
lowed the development of science in all directions;
and carried on an enormous correspondence. His
skill as an artist is seen in the illustrations which
he has furnished for many of his own works.
Kraszewski is an exceedingly methodical worker.
He never takes a work in hand until he has the
subject at his fingers’ ends; andl when he has once
placed himsell at his desk and begun to write, the
sheets fall from him at an Incredibly rapid rate.

What a chance Henniker Heaton has lost,
to be sure. The Island of Herm—one of the
Guernseys—was sold by auction lately. It is a mile
and a half long and three-quarters of a mile
broad. This is not extensive, but stiUanislandls
an island. Now, if Henniker had aiiything of the
Monte Christo in him, he would have bought
Herm and had himself crowned King of it. He
hungers for distinction; here was a distinction at
his hand. The population of the island is thirty-
seven. Out of these he could have constructed a
court and a standing army. Henniker the First o
Herm! Sounds gorgeous, doesn t it ? Some his-
torical characters, almost as celebrated in their
way as Henniker is in his, have had to wade througn
slaughter to a throne; Henniker would have only
had to wade through sea-weed. He waded through
sea-weed to a throne I How this phrase would
have thrilled the generations of Hermits to cornel
But he has lost the chance. And perhaps, after all,
he acted wisely in letting it go. His first act after
ascending the throne would have been tyrannical.
He couldn’t have helped it. He would have com-
manded all his subjects to subscribe to the Town
and Country Journal, and they would have re-
belled and flung him from the steepest rock in the

We thought Peter Campbell could never

which has about it a Tennysonian ring, evidently
the result of sitting near the Poet Laureate in the
House of Lords :—

There has been some immense fun—for the
boys, of course, not for the frogs-in the English
Divorce Court, lately. Firstly, several kind hus-

Cooper, a musician, sued for a divorce from his
wife on the ground of her adultery. He had
always, he said, lived happily with Mrs. Cooper
until her mother came to reside in his house
How a musician who played the cornet should
have found himself unable to get rid of his mother-
in-law we cannot imagine. During one of these
trials, it came out, whhe an allegation of adulterv
was being sifted, that “eight persons of all ages
and of different sex had slept in one room, and
that such an arrangement was quite common in
her (the witness’s) part of Yorkshire. ’ A railway
superintendent at Manchester got a divorce from
his “ better-half ” who had been “ carrying on with

It appeared that after Mr. Blackburn—for that
was the literary gentleman’s name—had been
bowled out in his little game, the lady’s father and
Major Hall, a friend of the latter, waited on him
and, after wringing a confession from him, they
nearly wrung his neck. Whereupon he addressed
to the husband the following cucumberlike piece of
counsel;—“Don’t allow yourself to be influenced
by such unreasoning madmen as one of the gen-
tlemen who called on me to-day.” He added a
diagnosis and a prescription in these terms: “ Your
wife is the victim of a mesmeric disease, and you
must treat her as a patient, and not as a reasonable
being.” A decree was granted. Mr. Herbert
Kent, of the well-known publishing firm, was
allowed to part company with his wife, who had
become enamoured of a waterman; and a lady
named Price, the wife of an army captain, who
she said, had cruelly ill-used her, was forced in
cross-examination to make the charming admission
that “she might have drunk methylated spirits
and turpentine.” Mr. Corrie manfully owned uu
to having kissed Mrs. Briggs, who was duly given
permission to support herself for the future; and
one Sarkles, an Indian barrister, who. It seemed
“ used to breakfast with his wife and then leave
her,” and who, it likewise appeared, accounted for
this strange but not, we have heard, uncommon
system of procedure by saying “ that his idol was
smashed,” was promptly divorced, when it came
out that he was in the habit of worshipping at the
shrine of an unbroken Idol down at St. John’s
Wood.
Truth is making another fierce onslaught
on the London usurers. In its issue of 3rd July u
prints the fifth of a series of Chcsterfleldian letters

criminal libels. For instance, one of the richest
and fattest of the fraternity is mentioned by name
and spoken of thus:—" You little knew when yon

Jordan, and that he was a bankrupt, and had been
convicted of keeping a disgusting exhibition, and
had to apply to a Father of his tribe to discount

financial prospects from his brother—an equally

self by utilising the experience he has so
dearly purchased.” And, to qnote once more;—
“ It might never strike you that Mr. John David
Myers, late of St. Mary Axe, and now of It Sack-
ville-street, cigar merchant, would, subject to the
advice of his solicitor and the consent of his part-
ner, Louison, accommodate with a little cash as
well as tobacco. The price of both is the same-
f rom sixty to eighty per cent, above the recognised
market value. Rather an expensive rate, perhaps,
to pay for credit for cigars; but then this firm has
heavy expenses to keep up, such as a private han-
som, broughams, and saddle-horses, which, when
not adorning the London parks, are enchanting
the residents and visitors on the King’s Road,
Brighton. Woe betide you if you get into Myers’s
hands I He is as difficult to settle with as was his
prototype, Shylock, for the world has not treated
him kindly of late. Only last year the magistrate
at Marlborough-street committed him, in company
with one Arthur Snelling, his tout, for trial at the
Old Bailey on a charge ot conspiring to defraud.”
In England, truth is an absolute defence in a libel
action. In N.8.W., mere truth is no defence. It
is no defence, even, to plead and prove that an
article was written in the public Interest. And
who can say that in the present instance Labou-
chere, who at the end of his article prints a list of
about twenty leading usurers, with terribly caustic
comments attached, is not doing a splendid public
service ?
A terrible story is told by General Ambert,
in the second volume of his “Souvenirs Mili-
taires.” Jean Moreau entered the service in 1870,
and on the 3rd of January, 1871, was engaged in
the affair at Bapaume. Towards 3 o’clock in the
afternoon, while he was loading a cannon, he was
struck down by a shell, which, bursting across his
face, tore away his nose, eyes, and upper jaw, and
a portion of the lower. He was left for dead on
the field, but after a time recovered his senses,
and by chance staggered, falling at almost every
step, on the road to the village of Ervllliers. The
colonel of the 24th Regiment sent him from this
place by carriage to Arras the next morning,
where he stayed till the 4th of October following.
He was transferred to the military hospital of the
Val do Grace at Paris a fortnight later, and re-
mained there till the 26th of March, 1872, when
cicatrisation was nearly complete. All the soft
portions of the fore part of the head having dis-
appeared, and the bony framework being crushed
in various places, the unfortunate man presented
the appearance of a veritable death’s head, with
two cavities for the eyes, one for the nose, and
a large opening for the mouth. However, by
ingenuity and patience a wax resemblance of a
face was invented and fitted with the utmost ex-
actitude to the healthy portions of flesh which
still surrounded the immense cicatrix. The adhe-
sion, which is almost hermetic, was completed by
a natural cushion of skin, which thus, as it were,
keeps the border of the mark in a groove. The
inner cavity has also been utilised, one of its uses
being, by means of lint, to guard the patient
against the effects of sudden alternations of heat
and cold, while the upper jaw and the palate are
protected by a plate, to which are attached a row
of false teeth, and mastication of the hardest kinds
of food is successfully performed. Thanks to the
disposition of the natural parts, and the Ingenious
shaping of the mask, and particularly that of the
false nose, respiration is rendered possible through
its nostrils, and, indeed, has regained the normal
direction, from below to above. The system of
aeration is assisted by two small holes towards the
inner angle of the eyes, creating a current of air,
the eyes themselves, of course, being closed. The
sense of smell, strange to say, has been regained,
while the voice possesses its natural tone and clear-
ness. Thus Moreau—who, when he removes his
mask, it is needless to say, presents a most hideous
aspect, in consequence of the disappearance of
great part of the bony portions, as well as the
muscles which should cover them, and of whose
head there literally remains only the brain and the
cranium—is enabled by this wonderful exercise of
surgical skill and constructive talent to breathe,
eat, speak, smell, and even, so it is said, to play the
flute. The mutilated soldier, who is fond of chat-
ting about his campaigns, possesses that resigned
air common to blind men, and his sense of touch,
moreover, has excessively developed. He lives at
Favril, Landrecios, in the Nord Department, and
ekes out his pension by the sale of a pamphlet re-
counting the facts of his wondrous cure. “ Per-
haps,” says General Ambert, “it would have been
well to have kept silence about this poor fellow;
but it Is not sufficient to only show the glories of
war, everyone should know the sacrifices of the
soldier. This one has given more than his life, for
each day which passes is a martyrdom.” Bnt
Moreau never complains. He is held in great re-
spect by those who know him, and feels a genuine
pride in showing the Cross of the Legion of Honour
THE LATEST LAND-SALE SPASM.

A PRETTY FACE.
What is more to be desired by a young lady than
a beautiful, clear complexion? She may have
wealth, education, and all the accomplishments
which will fit her to be an ornament to society
but if she have a sallow countenance, and her face
be covered with pimples, it will avail but little.
Let her remove the cause of all this disfigurement
by the use of Emil Prese’s Hamburg Tea, and our
word for it she will soon find her beauty fully
restored.
I A young lady In one of our pro-
minent institutions of learning, who
was a great favourite, not only
among her classmates but with all
the faculty, was obliged to give up
her studies and return home seriously
ill. Chronic nervous sick headache,
accompanied by impaired digestion,
by which the circulation and nutri-
tion of the brain was impaired,
rendered her very miserable. A
physician was called, who, apparently
not understanding the nature of her
- ailment, failed to afford relief A
friend who had been similarly afflic-
ted, and found Immediate relief by
1 using Emil Frege’s Hamburg Tea,
recommended the same to her. She
made trial of it, and, to her great
joy, found a decided improvement as
• the result. After a few days’ use of
this popular remedy, she was fully
restored.
A marvel of the age. It is impos-
sible to say too much in praise of that
good old standard remedy, Emil
Frese’s Hamburg Tea, and no house-
hold should be without it. It pre-
vents, as well as cures, skin diseases,
gravel, affected liver, headache, nau-
sea bile, wind. Indigestion, constipa-
tion, fevers, sleeplessness, lassitude,
foul breath, and every disease
brought on or aggravated by a dis-
ordered stomach. Once used it is al-
ways used. Try it.

Everything' I had heard of in the East and West
for Salt Rheum. My case was considered a very
bad one. My face, head, and some parts of my
body were almost raw. Head covered with scabs

ipdve of the world as the Sydney Witness, which
ninus journal gravely and circumstantially gives
{he dimensions of Heaven in miles and yards, has
nf the appearance of even the back gate of Para-
he would, no doubt, have expectorated ana-
themas and maledictions of blood-and-fire. But,
heimr a lawyer, with a good knowledge of human
nature he consented to the wedding. And when
the young man found that it was not, after all,
rewarded as such a very wicked feat to marry an
Stress,” it occurred to him either that It
mhrht not be a good thing to get married at
all or that it might, perhaps, be advisable, ere
ho’ finally made up his mind and took the
nhimre, to have another look round. And so
ho "cooled off ” and gave Miss Fortescue certain
hints-wbich she, being an actress who by no
stretch of imagination could be compared for
ability to (say) Nellie Stewart, of course refused
to take-her eye being probably fixed far more
.irmly on the prospective coronet of Cairns than
on his actual Lordship of Garmoyle. It is quite
nossible that the young man acted meanly—it is
also quite possible that he did nothing of the sort.
Suppose he hod said to her substantially thus: “ It
la true I promised to marry you. It is true I told
vou I loved you. I now find that I don’t, and it is,
perhaps, just as well for both of us that this has
been found out before instead of after marriage.”
What then ? If she under those circumstances
declines to formally break off the engagement,
she forces into this position the man she professes
to love: “The only way in which I can escape
being mulct in heavy damages by a set of owlish
iurymen, who are sure to be struck, perhaps even
as I was struck, by her pretty face when first I saw
it is to marry the girl. No, I’ll not be roasted in
the witness-box and have my love-letters, written
aa much in champagne as in ink, laughed at all
over the civilised world. I’ll go to her lawyers
and put it thus: ‘ I promised, after an acquaint-
ance of one month, begun by throwing a bouquet
with my card attached, to your client, to marry her.
lam now willing, for certain private reasons, to
carry out my promise, notwithstanding all that
has occurred—but your client must understand
that I do not love her, and that I shall like her all
the less bn account of her readiness to rush into
legal proceedings. If she Insists upon it, we two
will start a matrimonial hell. Our married life,
begun in an action for breach of contract, will
probably terminate in a divorce suit. Your client’s
claim for £30,000 is preposterous. I’m willing to
give her £500 (or £5000) to cry off, and, if she won’t
take that, I’ll marry her!” The son of a lord, with
entailed estates, can afford to defend a breach of
promise action, as a mere diversion, if he so chooses
to regard it, while Brown or Robinson, made of
ordinarv clay, who has scraped together a few
hundreds or thousands, and been entrapped by a
Miss Fortescue, has no choice but to "play or
pay ’’—with, in either case, almost equally disas-
trous results. When a man heartlessly wrecks the
life of the trusting and steadfast woman who has
been engaged to him for years by jilting her and
marrying another, ho commits a grievous wrong,
for which all possible reparation should be ex-
acted. But, when the courts have come to be used
as instruments of vengeance and black-mail, not
by sterling women who have lost “the face which
is her fortune” through long years of waiting,
but by pert chits in Worth’s dresses they never
earned themselves, urged on by greedy unscrupu-
lous mothers who hesitate not to sell en gros (at a
church) what Faustine sells en detail in the streets
-when, we say, such perversions of justice have
become so common that they are accepted as
matters of course, it is doubtful whether the
whole fabric of breach of promise with its grim
alternative of “church or court” should not be
swept away. When Lady Clara Vere de Vere, or
for the matter of that, when Mary Jones, the sew-
ing-machine girl, tells the Judge that a rich man
she has known three months has jilted her, and
behaved like a scoundrel, the Judge must be
taught to ask whether she really thinks she should
be paid for being saved from the embraces of a
villain. And when the calculating woman, who
has waited long for the opulent Lothario, who has
failed to “ come to the scratch,” recites a piteous
tale which comes more from her empty pocket and
her itching palm than from her bleeding heart, she
must be told, p our encourager les autres, that just
as the ready-money system is good in business, so
long credit is bad in Love.

The Duke of Marlborough is proprietor of
eleven livings in the Church of England. Luckily,
being hard-up owing to the late Duke having, in
consequence of his—the present Duke’s—reckless
profligacy, left every penny he could to other mem-
bers of the family, his Grace seems to intend selling
the advowsons as they fall in. Had he exercised
his right of presentation, there’s no knowing to
what sort of Jack-priests he would have given his
preference. As it is, among the speculative par-
sons who buy the “cures of souls’’ owned by the
Duke, there may be some who are merely simonia-
ca), and not blackguards after the Duke’s own
heart.
“ Whash up, Pitt?” said a well-corned
friend to the groat statesman; “ I can’t shee th’

who had been there himself; “ why, I c’n shee live
or shix ov ’em.” This reminds us that the Peter
Paul Rubens, who draws polonaises and prize pigs
for the Sydney Mail, has evidently mislaid his
Blue Ribbon badge again, as he has recently
struck off a sketch of Darling Harbour, in which
there are no less than seven locomotives snorting
impatiently on the track. As a matter of fact,
there are seluom more than two, and never more
than three engines located there, and the artist
has not only drawn on his imagination for his
locos., but he has also drawn them on the wrong
lines. The wonder is, however, that he didn’t
draw them upside down, with flery-eycd, sulphur-
spouting snakes squirming round the funnels, and
pink-headed bull-dogs making boarding-house
hash of the engineers and stokers.
In London, the other day, Henry Gilby
was charged with begging. A witness stated that
each time a penny was thrown to prisoner he
placed his hat on the ground, and, kneeling upon
it, would place his hands in an attitude of prayer.
This had the effect of attracting attention, and
several coins were thrown to him. In court,
prisoner said he had been engaged for four years
in singing sacred hymns in the streets—more parti-
cularly that well-known hymn, “ Hark, the Herald
Angels sing,” when the public threw him pennies
he generally knelt down in order to show his grati-
tude to the Supreme Being. (Prisoner illustrated
the manner in which he showed his gratitude, fall-
ing on his knees in the dock, and clasping his
bands above his head, and bowing until his head
nearly touched the ground.) The magistrate re-
marked that so far from the songs being edifying,
they had been sung with the most disgusting
hypocrisy, and sent Gilby to gaol for fourteen
days. Prisoner, on his way to the cells, said, “ Well,
I ought to get on; I do try.”
What is art ? Whar did it come from, an’
whar on earth is it g wine to stop ? Mr. T. Channon
is the photographic Raphael of Burrowa, and Bur-
ro wa, by the way, must be painfully short of either
cash or culchaw. Luckily for its fair fame, how-
ever, the taking Mr. Channon has settled down in
Slattery's pocket bone-yard, and in the Burrowa
Hard Times generously announces that “ as many
would-be patrons of tae photographic art cannot
pay the full amount at time of sitting, he will take
halt cash, and the balance on delivery of fotoes.”
But this is not all; for the patriotic collodion
swas her declares that, rather than see fellow-beings
starving for their “picture,” he will “ take produce
of/any kind—eggs, butter,Jbacon, poultry,” &o.—in
return for his artistic services. The idea works
well all round, and should a tow-headed young
urchin calls and squeak out, “ Pleath, thir, Ma
sez she won’t take these ere futtoes, coz they’re no
good,” the enterprising photographer can simply
reply, “ Take them back, and tell your Ma they’re a
crimson sight better than the eggs she sent in pay-
ment for them.”
For a good old quiet Sunday sermon, there
is no place witbin a twenty milos’ drive of the
Southern capital to equal St. Kllda. That is es-
pecially true since Laurence Rentoul kissed his
hands to the ladies and wagged his leg at the men
of the opulent East. The Rev- C. E. Drought is
there now. He professed to shiver atheists last
week, and brought the full of the house about
him to hear his terrific impeachment of their
crimes and perfidies, Drought was rather an un-
happy name for the reverend evangelist to bring
with him into the world, and is not at all a seduc-
tive name in a country where the pubs, are shut
on Sunday. But it has a most important use. It
will go a good way to kill atheism. The preacher
himself wasn’t worth a song, wasn’t worth half a
bar of a nigger melody. His whole disproof of
atheism lay in such phrases as “ I do not court the
acquaintanceship of any atheist.” But his name
is fatal against the philosophy of materialism.
Solve this triumphant query of the churchman:
How else, except on the theory of an existing
< 'eity and of an all-ruling, all-ordering Providence,
could Drought have got his name? Keep your
eye on Drought, and answer that.
Grenfell is essentially a musical township,
for, although it has no duly-organised, legally-
ordained outlet for its musical geniuses, still it
contains enough Pattis and Sims Reeves to run a
Continental show, and enough instrumental musi-
cians to damn the whole of the globe beyond
redemption. Any undertaker who treats his cus-
tomers with common civility and attention can
make a fortune up there in six months, except
when a musical season is in full blast, and then
business runs to seed, as it were, because the un-
happy victims go out too far in the bush before
they saw their jugulars through, or blow out their
brains with bows and arrows. The slightest pre-
text is sufficient for the “talent” to revenge
themselves on the miserable people of Grenfell,
and it is even hinted that men have been murdered
in cold blood simply to afford the town trouba-
dours an excuse for raking up a concert for his
wife and children. One woman is said to net about
£300 a year by supplying the “amachers” with
the mangled carcases of men whom she trades off
as her lawful husbands, and now we find even the
clergy are in the swim, for the funds of the Holy
Trinity Church are about to be enriched by the
proceeds of a ball; a sinful ball, from which the
men will come away as tired as a Rand wick ’bus-
horse after a four-days’ race meeting, and about
which the girls, in their own giddy way, will de-
clare that, although the dancing wasn’t up to
much, still the “ ’ugging was somethin’ ’eavenly.”
This Holy Trinity ball is to be followed by a Holy
Triqity concert, or corroboree, the bright particu-
lar star of which, it is said, will be a lady in the
cuisine business, who will sing “ Partant pour La
Syrie,” by desire, and in honour of a prominent
member of the Bourbon family, at present staying
at Grenfell, the lady will also warble a part in the
lovely duet between Marie and Tony in “ La Figlia
del Reggimento.”
Another good man gone wrong. A few
weeks ago, the local papers in a certain nourishing
town up North came out with glowing pars, which
announced that honest worth had been duly re-
cognised at last, and their respected town clerk
had just been granted two months well-deserved
leave of absence in return for the faithful service
he had rendered to the municipality. These
eulogies wound up, of course, with the slncerest
wishes that the worthy official would enjoy a
pleasant trip down South, and return with his
overworked frame and shattered constitution once
more restored to their pristine health and vigour.
All this was an honest spontaneous burst of
genuine feeling on the part of the journals in
question, and the fact that the town clerk dealt
out paying ads. with a lavish hand had nothing
whatever to do with the business. Through some
strange Infatuation, however, this respected offi
cial neglected to clear out when he had the chance,
and now he longs for the wings of a dove or even
the legs of a dingo that he might hie away down to
even Kerguelen’s Island, for the very papers that
but a few weeks ago chronicled his sterling worth,
are now pained to announce that at a Council
meeting which was recently held with closed doors
their much-esteemed servant had a matter of
£380 on the wrong side of his public ledger. His
resignation has since been accepted, and in con-
sideration of his being a single man and only re-
ceiving the paltry pittance of £7 a week for his
invaluable services, it is thought that the missing
sum will be raised and all may yet end happily.
This makes the third town clerk who has gone
bung up that way, and the Mayor, like a second
Diogenes, is now poking around with a lamp in
search! of an honest man. Unfortunately for him,
all our honest citizens are in a state of indepen-
dence or else in gaol, and therefore we can render
no assistance Just at present. |
RECOVERED!
A Remarkable Story of a
Government Official.
A Case of Suffering Without a
Parallel.
Official Indorsement by the U.S,
Commissioner.
From the New Oreans Times-Democra[?].
Some thirty-two years since, then a boy of Bix~
teen, resident in Western New York, i was at-
tacked with what was declared by the physicians a
pronounced case of hereditary scrofula. It ap-
peared In the form of a glandular swelling upon
the loft side of the neck, which, despite all of the
usual old-time remedies, continued to grow, be-
coming at, say eighteen, a seeming fixture of
about the size of a hen's egg. The swelling was
frequently very sore and painful, the more so that
it was much of the time raw from the daily appli-
cation of iodine. The general health became very
much broken, and the prospects In life, for one
just verging upon manhood, were gloomy enough.
A promising physician in Cleveland, Ohio, ad-
vised a change of climate, with a life of hardship
and exposure, as presenting, in connection with
youth, a possible chance of recovery. A removal
to the South and West, and an active, out-door life
tor some years, attested the soundness of his judg-
ment. The scrofulous swellings gradually disap-
peared; the system as gradually toned itself up;
the broken and dispirited boy became a strong and
hearty man of 183 pounds. There was a respite
for fifteen years. During all of this time there
was no sign of a return of the dread disease. As
the future but too sadly proved, however, it was
none the less surely, if slowly, working. In the
spring of 1870, now thirteen years since. It again
put in an appearance, and in an Intensely aggra-
vated form. First, a single ulcer appeared upon
the left breast; this was but the precursor of more
than ten long years of as miserable and wretched
an existence, with certainly as much of physical
suffering, as often falls to the lot of man. The one
ulcer was followed by another, until the whole
surface of the breast was but one mass of corrup-
tion. Some of these ulcers were not less than one
and a half inches in diameter, the edges rough,
ragged, and seemingly dead, the cavity open to
the bone, and filled with a yellowish, waxy, and
exceedingly offensive matter. Everything known
to the medical fraternity was tried in vain. The
disease became but the more and more virulent
Gradually the bone itself became diseased, and
then the sufferings began in earnest. Bone ulcers
here and there began to take the place of those
hitherto on the surface.
The difference manifest in these was that the
eruptions were of a watery nature, were copious,
and were attended with almost constant and severe
pain. About the only relief experienced was
found in burning the whole surface of the breast,
night and morning, literally to a blister, with a
strong solution of carbolic acid. This served as a
disinfectant, removing the otherwise Intolerable
smell, loosened up the matter, and allayed for the
time the intolerable itching. As if all this was not
enough, the ulcers broke out upon the shoulder-
blades, and extended to the small of the back, and
then, indeed, the cup of misery was complete,
I became reduced to a mere wreck; for months
at a time could not get my hands to my own head
because of extreme soreness ; could not turn over
in bed without first rising to a sitting posture;
knew not from the one year's end to another what
it was to be an hour even free from pain, save, as
before stated, in the temporary relief afforded by
the burning of the ulcers with carbolic acid; had
reason to look upon life itseif as a curse.
In the summer of i860, after better than ten long
years of this wretched existence, I was induced by
a lady friend to try a box of Cuticura. I did so,
much as I tried everything else that offered, with-
out any faith. I was agreeably surprised to find,
at once, that it acted with a wonderful, soothing
effect, in allaying the terrible burning and itdhing
of the ulcers. I was induced, a little later, to try
a box of Cuticura Resolvent. While I saw no
immediate effect upon ihe particular disease, I
was encouraged to continue its use by an unex-
ampled and flattering result in quite another
direction. I had been troubled with the Dyspepsia.
I found here at once an agreeable sense of relief,
I continued to use Cuticura Remedies. After
some months I began to see a change, and for the
better. The old ulcers began to discharge far
more freely, and relief was experienced in propor-
tion. The general tone of the system began to im-
prove; there was a marked increase in the appe-
tite, and a most decided improvement in the di-
gestion. I kept on with the remedies, and kept on
improving. First the one old ulcer, which had
run for more than ten years, gradually healed.
Then another, and still another. There were new
and frequent eruptions. Truly enough, they were
rather encouraging than otherwise, in that, unlike
the old, they discharged themselves freely and
healed again in a comparatively short time.
Finally, after something better than two years’
persistent use of the Cuticura Remedies, the last
ulcer was healed. The work of lenovation has
been slow, but seemingly sure. The dread disease
has succumbed. All over the breast, shoulders
and back, where for so many long, long years all
was but a mass of corruption, there is now a
healthy skin.
The broken-down system has gradually recuper-
ated ; has increased in weight from 133 to 158
pounds; the good work is still going on: the gen-
eral health is becoming remarkably good • the
man of 48 years of age, after more than 13 years
of suffering, feels himself a new man. and all
through the Cuticura Remedies.
I make this affidavit uncalled for, and wholly
through a sense of duty to suffering humanity,
that others, perhaps, influenced thereby, may
themselves be healed. I am not altogether un-
known, and there are those in prominent positions
here personally knowing to much as here stated

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist's art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and Itl .1 more enduring,
ft one but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest teste. Ornaments made
from this new composition are equal in design and
gemral appearance to those made of the finest
bS-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe of
the Cost of the genuine goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals-
but we do alHrm that it is so perfect an Imitation
of the sterling gold as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery mado of it may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. 80 perfect is It, and so
large has our trad 3 become, that Jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness
In trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. Rut as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deai
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you be dissatisfied with your Investment
after inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where malls are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—we
will return the money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order tor what you may require.
N.D —We find that, through an error on the port
of the manufacturers. we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for the purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that line of Goods, we will send to
any customer (post free, If at a distance) on receipt
of Five Shillings (5s.), a really exquisite Oriental
Gold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
ance to a Five Guinea Brooch of the sterling metal.
This offer holds good for a few weeks only, and Is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for the Brooches will keep, and they are
of the latest design. “To see is to want,” is a
saying so applicable to our goods, that It pays us,
la the long run, to forward to any person a sample
Brooch at price. Examine our catalogue, and
write to us or call on us for what you may desire.

Ruskin describes a civilised nation in
modern Europe as consisting in broad terms of (1)
a mass of half-taught, discontented, and mostly
penniless populace, calling itself the people; of {‘I)
a thing which calls itself a government—mean-
ing an apparatus for collecting and spending
money; and (3) a small number of capitalists, many
of them rogues, and most of them stupid persons,
who have no idea of any object of human exist-
ence other than money-making, gambling, or
champagne-bibbing. A certain quantity of literary
men saying anything they can be paid to say; of
clergymen, saying anything they have been taught
to say; of natural philosophers, saying anything
that comes into their heads; and of nobility, say-
ing nothing at all—combine in disguising the action
and perfecting the disorganization of the mass;
but with respect to practical business, the civilised
nation consists broadly of mob, money-collecting
machine, and capitalist.

“The Shaughraun ” was put on at the
Opera House on Saturday night with Jennie Lee
in the title role. We told you about this last week,
and the result was was that you rolled up to see
bow the little actress would sustain a character
like Cone, the romantic Irish hero who was alwaj s
trusting to luck, always getting into scrapes, and
always helping his friends out of them. And how
did Jennie play it ? Well, we’re not done laugh-
ing yet. We have seen a lot of people play “The
Shaughraun,” but we never saw anybody who
played it like our famous Little Jo. She didn't
play it at all, if you ask us about it. She went
through the lines well enough, but it wasn’t Conn
that she acted. It was Jennie Lee. But it was
entertaining, nevertheless; and, bile the critical
were amused at her quaint conception of the
character, other people lauahed because they felt
good, so that altogether the entertainment was
thoroughly enjoyed, we expected that Jennie
would be pert and saucy in this piec , and would
got a lot of fun out of it, and, as usual, we gave
ourselves the correct tip; but the little mite of a
woman isn’t big enough to play Conn, excentto
burlesque it, and if she hadn’t the audacity of the
devil she wouldn’t have attempted it.
m * »
The cast was the moat un-Irish that we
ever saw undertake to interpret one of Bouci-
cault’s plays, d he only Irishman (or woman
either) in it was James Carden, who took the part
of Corrv Kinchela. Carden is always fair when he
is not positively good, and we liked his conception
of the Squireen. He looked just like the hard-
hearted wretch who turned our grandfather and
his pig out of the house because he couldn’t pay
the rent while the whisky was .so dear. We know
that Carden looked like this villian. for our vener-
able ancestor often said that he had a lace on him
that would scare a dog away from a roll of
sausage. Boucicault’s plays are so full of pretty
sentiments, which nobody but the Irish appear to
appreciate or understand, that the tenderest
beauties are lost when the lines are rea 1 by those
who have never been in Ireland, nor have made a
study of the Irish character.
• * *
We were cross about this, Saturday night,
when we heard Moya (Miss Ada Lee) running care-
lessly over lines that might have been rendered so
as to touch a sympathetic chord in everybody’s
liver. Moya is really a splendid character, but ii;
takes a lot more ability, a lot more study, and
heap better training than A.da Lee appears to have
been born with or achieved, or had thrust upon
her, to play the role to the satisfaction of those
who know anything about the ways of the Irish
peasant girl. Miss Blanche Lewis’s Clare
Folliott wa n’t anywhere near the mark, and
her brogue was simply ridiculous; but she
looked as sweetly as a pink-breasted cockatoo
with its tail out off and its beak broken. Beauty
covets a multitude of professional sins, and an
audience overlooks defects that would appear
strikinarly prominent in a homely woman. Poor
Sara Bernhardt found this out when she first went
to America and the reporters began criticising the
fatness of her feet and the evident slimness of the
limbs they supported. Sara got mad about this,
and wrote to the papers that sne hadn’t come all
the way from France to relish the idea of finding
people who were rude enough to talk and scribble
about things they had no business to look at, even
on a windy day when the dust was flying. She
wanted to be criticised on her merits as an actress,
she said, but the critics seemed rather to prefer to
treat her from the standpoint of a model of bean-
pole symmetry. As an artiste, they couldn’t find
much fault with her; but as a sample of human
grace and beauty, physically, they had more fun
about her than two tom-cats tied together by the
tail and slung over a clothes-line. Blanche has it
all the other way. The critics are always saying
something pleasant about her, until the first thing
she knows she’ll stand a chance of becoming as
famous as Mis. Langtry.
* * *
Oily Deering took the audience right along
with him as Harvey Duff, and for that reason we
are going to let him live a while longer. George
Forbes tried Captain Molyneaux, and succeeded
like the old woman who kept a tavern up in
Queensland. Oh, yes! and this just reminds us
that George has been writing a comedy entitled
“ The Philanthropist,” which is to be played for
the first time on any stage at the Gaiety on Satur-
day evening, August 30. We don’t know anything
about George’s skill as a playwright, but we are
going to the Gaiety to see his production, and if
it’s bad enough to deserve any of our attention,
we’ll let you know about it in time to make up
your mind whether you care to look at it. We
have no disposition to nip aspiring genius in the
bud, and for that reason wc hope that Mr. Forbes
has done something worthy to entitle him to a per-
manent roosting place on the gibbet of fame. But
we have hovered long enough amongst the crowd
at the Opera House, and it only remains for us to
tell you that “ The Shaughraun ” will be repeated
until further notice. And it draws better than
“Divorvons,” which was on there a short time ago
and came pretty near being a frost.

Stanley’s Juveniles have at last undertaken
something that we feel like commending. This
week they have been doing “ Jack the Giant-
killer ” in a way that nearly fractured our anatomy
to look at. The “ gorgeous burlesque and panto-
mime” has been specially localised by Messrs.
Mayers and Duff. We sit beside Mr. Mayers the
other night, and it must be confessed we were
just a trifie surprised to see the modesty with
which he bore his honours when the people ap-
plauded the new songs and local hits. We once
tried our hand at localising a burlesque,
and since we have seen Mr Mayers’ hap-
piness, wo are firmly convinced that applause
is better than diseased eggs and tomatoes after all.
Not that any of those things struck us, for they
didn’t; but the atmosphere in the theatre at the
close of the second act was so full of them that the
players retired in confusion ana couldn’t be in-
duced to go on again for love or money. As a
playwright, we were chagrined and otherwise
grinned almost out of our boots. Since that time
we have a sort of sympathetic feeling for every
blooming genius who undertakes to tackle fame
upon that line. We don’t tackle any more. A
quiet life is good enough for us now, and it pays
everybody but our creditors for us to keep that
way.
* * *
Annie Childs played in the title role in a
moat captivating manner, and sang and danced so
prettily that we wished ourself a boy again so that
we could go on the stage and learn to do a statue
clog, or something, with her for teacher. There is
real talent in this little lady; and if flattery or
something else don’t spoil her before she has a full
chance to develop, the world may hear of her.
We don’t wonder that Jack was Queen Bee's
special favourite, but we did wonder that she
didn’t run her sword straight through the burly
Giant Gorgibuster, instead of poking it under his
arm, and allowing the little Lord Chamberlain to
saw his leg off with a wooden cheese-knife. Jack’s
mother (Master Favargen) was a funny old dame,
who made the moat of a very good part. If our
mother had looked like that, we are very certain
we wouldn’t have been born.
* * *
But there was one little chap that caught
our eye,and who is the most finished little actor that
we ever saw on the stage. This was Master Har-
man, the Lord Chamoerlain. The lad is almost a
baby, not bigger than a Moreton Bay oyster,
and yet he does some of the funniest stage
business imaginable. He is so thoroughly at
home and self possessed, and seems to enter into
the spirit of the burlesque with such perfect zest,
that we wanted to gather the little villain in our
arms and fill his pockets full of lollies and for-
bidden fruit. The oddest part of it is that the kid
has been left entirely to his own Ingenuity in
working up his funny business, and almost every
evening he interpolates something new that the
remainder of the troupe are not looking for. Such
precociousness, if it sticks to him, will make him
eventually a smarter man than we are, and that’s
almost useless to think of if you take our unbiassed
opinion on the matter.

Harry Stanley personated the Giant Gor-
glbuster, and made himself up so frightfully that
the children in the audience began to scream when
brat he stuck his nose out from behind the wings.
There were some fine historical points about that
Giant costume, too, but we forget what thev are
just now. Anyway, it doesn’t make any difference
—for it isn’t likely that anybody but us, who used
to manufacture nursery tales to frighten Old
Mother Hubbard’s children, would bo sufficiently
familiar with the history of Giant days to criticise
with intelligence the costume of one of these mon-
sters of the past. And what's the use of criticism
when the people don’t understand it ? That’s
what players and playgoers ask sometimes after
they ve been wading through an opening night
notice in the Herald. Fortunately for us, we're
not restrained from giving it up.

If you think of anything else that we
should have told you about the Juveniles please
supply it for yourself, for we are now going out
to the settlement on the recent boat-race. Do
y° u know, we got on the right side cf that boat-
race ? That came from our intimacy with Profes-
sor Baldwin. You see, we have learned to read
minds now, and we read Beach’s like an open
book. It told us that he was going to beat Hanlan,
and so we backed him for all we were worth—two
lead pencils and a saveloy-and now we expect to
he rich. And this reminds us that Professor
Baldwin has been exposing spirits up at Orange.
The other day he was fooling with his revolver
which ho didn t think was loaded, when it went
off and shot away a piece of his foot. It was
only a llesh-wound, but the Professor danced
around and yelled so that the inhabitants gathered
Then the report was circulated that the Professor
had attempted suicide This was telegraphed to
the Sydney papers, and the next day wc got a
letter from our friend, saying, “ Contradict the re-
port that I attempted to commit suicide. I’m
having too much fun in this world to think of
trying to get out of it. It’s raining like Hades in
Orange to-day. but we’re doing a booming busi-
ness.’ Hereafter, before the Professor takes a
revolver in hand, he is going to put Mrs. Baldwin
into a trance to And out whether it’s loaded. If it
is, then he’ll let her handle it wt lie he goes off
down town to get out of the wajr. But we ouvhr,
■o tell you that the Juveniles are going to play
“Jack the Giantkiiler” only up to Saturday night
of this week, when the kids are advertised to
tackle The Pirates of Penzance.”

night to fill the streets, Hood the public houses,

Nellie Stewart was the Serpolette and
Fanny Liddiard the Germaine. Nell was in fine
form, twittering and romping away as if anklous
to show that there was no real difference between
the French larrikiness and the home-made article
ot which we are so justly vain. But there was a
lack or variety in her gestures and poses which
became a little tiresome. To stick her arms
akimbo, in the manner adopted by Billingsgate
ladies when resolved to let their neighbours into
some domestic derails of a spicy nature, was her
commonest endeavour, and won hearty demon-
strations of approval from the more juvenile S3c-
tion of the gods," who varied their enthusiasm
by playfully squirting tobacco-juice at oue
another in honour of Beach’s success, or dropping
orange-peel on the heads of the elderly and bald-
headcd!habitu«5s of the pit. There is a deal of inno-
cent enjoyment to bo obtained by obse ving the
pleasant surprise of a thoughtful middie-aged
man when a banana or an onion reaches his head
trom a considerable elevation. He seems to enter
so into the fun of the thing—to seize, as it were
the whole measure of the original humour that is
contained in launching an unpretentious vegetable
into space and trusting to the well-known law of
gravitation to ;make sure of its squashing oo his
uncovered head—that he rarely fails to look up
with a smile. Alas ! if men who have seen their
days only knew how agreeable they could often
make themselves to their more youthful fellows
by welcoming those cheerful little pleasantries in
a becoming way, we would hear less ol the selfish
petulance exhibited by many, old enough to know
better, when roused from their uncompanionable
frigidity by a turnip or a cauliflower I
• * *
Liddiatci was not so abandoned (we believe
yffs *T ro °8r. but haven’t time to correct it) as
Nell. Nor had she any cause. But she looked so
fresh, and plump, and blooming that you felt that
it her voice were only a bit more powerful, she
would be perfect. As Gaspard, Mr. Kelly acted
and looked like a miser, or, rather, like the preva-
lent idea of what a miser ought to be. For, as a
matter of fact, the idea and the reality are verv
much at variance. Your thorough-going 1 miser is
much oftener dressed in broadcloth and fine linen
than in rags. The facial expression used by Mr.
Kelly to do duty fora “smile ” was a leer of such
pronounced rascal ty that the leader of the or-
ches ra missed a beat in studying it. And his
laugh—it was an amalgam of all the uncanny
cr .O‘ks Jot loose in the world since Saul’s tete-a-tete
with Endor—a laugh that made your fingers itch
for a good grip or the frowsy old creature’s frayed
collar, and your thumbs for a firm pressure on his
wind-pipe. As the Marquis, Mr. Vernon sang well
and looked ‘ lovely.” Forde’s Baiilie and Wallace's
Gobo kept the house simmering with their tom-
fooleries, although the “gag” they so unsparingly
used was occasionally tunny, but mostly teiribie
in its inspired stupidity. For years we have sought
to be brought face to face with the heartless
wretches who localise foreign bizarrerie , or write
jokes for travelling Minstrels. But in vain. Yet
I n do ifc ’ ar ? d ’ considering that Messrs.

who do so much to loster crime by me«ns of their
hideous pieasantries. As Jean Grenicheux, Mr

tatel of the choral arrangements of the tragedy of
Antigone, by our old friend Sophocles, drew a
lar ?e?hd distinguished audience to the Exhibition
Building on Thursday. That is to say it drew us
and if we are not large and distinguished, we’d
like to know about it. The reason we went was
because our dear old friend, Jack Sophocles, got
us to read oyer the play before he offered it to the
Evenings Nogs tor publication, and we were able
to afford him some encouragement and to suggest
some improvements. The circumstance that the
dramatic action was not represented the other

ment very materially, and our dear friend, Men-
delssohn Bartholdy—who also owes much to
hints—was enabled to mark the passage
thus:— Enter Creon, andante;” and the open-
T 01 , ,°f the ensuing appeal by Anti-
gone, beginning Uncle and Aunty,” had a pro-
dicious effect. Our dear friend Mendelssohn
was, perhaps, not so amenable to reason as was
Sophocles (although we loved them both like
brothers, and they were among the earliest sub-
scribers to The Bolletixos). Ho declined to
adopt our suggestion that the incarceration of
Antigone should be expressed by sequences of
double bars, C, eon’s eran iness entirely phrased
in crochets, and the tremors of the men of Thebes
by quavers. Three thousand people were present
to hear the Liedertafel sing this story, and His
Excellency the Governor was just ten days and ten
hours late. T,, is may appear strange. The way to
get at It Is this. If you keep one person waiting
live minutes, th it amounts to well, it amounts to
more than you do. It you keep 3(J00 persons waiting
live minutes, that is just 3000 times five minutes of
waiting- to which your want of consideration has
exposed people. That makes ten days and ten hours.
Punctuality is the politeness of Princes (old and
disrespectful proverb). If, however, his most
sacred Excellency came late, be made up for it,
with the most delicate sensibility, by going early,

But, then, what would you have? The performers
and audience were merely people, and if they don’t
understand the manners and ideas of the ftussian
Court, we pity them. Of the music, by our dear
friend Mendelssohn, we need say little. Max
Vogrich has worked up chorus and orchestia to
the top of their capacity. The choruses were
faultless, so far as we could discover on a first
hearing of such a wor—we mean, of course, a
first hearing since we left Athens and Berlin.

We’re not going to tell you much about
the Minstrels this week, for the truth is that the
people hbep crowding into the Academy, so that
there isn’t nardly room for our feet down-stairs,
and we never go into the gallery, for it takes too
long to get out between the act . And then the
“ g-'-ds ” up there howl and screech like the Moore
Park dog show, until we can’t hear ourselves
think. When we go early, however, and get down
among the fashionables, we’re right; but, you see,
we can’t, always go learly without losing a number
of drinks that couldn’t very well be regained after
the siiow. Such has been our tender solicitude for

" THE POOR PLAYER.”
[Correspondence is invited from members of the
Theatrical Profession.]
There is uo such a thing as a poor player
now, counter-luncheons are s® common “Im-
pulse” seems to have got the Victorians at the
Princess's; and Clark and Ryman-will they never
die I—are at it at thb Opera House Writing of
Emelie Melville, who is giVirig them “Girofle,” the
gorgeous scribe who does the theatres tor the
Melbourne Spoilsman, delivers himself of the
following:— 1 “‘See how it sparkles,’ is always good
for a hearty encore, while Moorzook is one of those
parts Parley fairly revels in. From start to finish
everything goes trippingly, and when the curtain
tails, the audience, like the scholars at Dotht-
boys Hall, look as if they’d like ‘some more.’”
We were under the impression that these boys got
rather more than they wanted.. The fascinating
Georgina Smithson is in Christchurch; and Fred.
Millis had a ben. and is off to America-or Dubbo.
And it seems that Mr. Fisher has an Opera Bouffe
Company, and, strangely enough, plays comedy...
Pick.’s Pano>ama;(with all the “ well-known elo-
quence ”) Is at Port Adelaide.... Little Dunning is
giving them “Rip” at Abbott’s Opera House, at
Auckland, but re-opens in Christchurch on the
36th prox.; and Frank Towers is having a big
block of his usual luck at Garner's theatre.
Adelaide, ’Twas ever thus—but, gently now I
the feelings of a father must be respected
The Critic Of the BUniIaberg Mail has a brain
that teems So with originality that we wonder he
can keep his hat on. It seems that Tyrell’s opera
company with Lambert and Templeton, Ac., are
there, and ne announces that they will open in the
“ever green Grand Due ess.” He doesn’t seem to
realise the fact that whatever the Grand Duchess
was, she wasn’t ever i/reen. Then they play, he
says, in “the ever-favourite Maritana,” &c. In
the end, this kind of stereotyped bosh becomes
intolerable. The title of the company (which ap-
pears to be bossed by Tyrell) is “ The Comic Opera
Company.” It is the only troupe on the road, we
think, that plays “Ti-e Pirates” with two and a
half of Major-General’s daughters... .Grattan has
been having luck all the time, up North, and
things are good at ArmiJalo. No “property
chains,” now, we can tell you I Buagy by the
day, and a resplendent “window-pane,”... And
hero is rather a funny thing from the Brisbane
Courier, which appeared the night after the
occasion of the fire panic at the theatre:—“ In
the stalls, which were crowded, a large proportion
of the men made a cowardly rush for the entrance
passage, leaving the women to shift for them-
selves. The abandoned 'women fortunately took
things coolly.” “Buzzy” wrote that himself, or
we’ll “eat our heads!’.... Poor Ada Ward met
with a cool reception at a matinee at the Princess’s
Theatre, London, in Pauline. We don’t know who
the Claude was except that it was not Larry
Foley. But Larry can’t be everywhere It ap-
pea s, though, that George Darrell is to have at
the Grand a show, at last, for “ The Sunny fcouth.”
— In seems rather wearisome to have to chronicle
the fact that Tommy Hudson has been playing in
the Old Bond Store, Cairns (N.Q ); equally so to
write that “ Mr. By ne’s Company ’ (whom we don’t
remember ever having heard of before) are up
Inglewood way, tipping the rustics to “Ten Nights
in a Bar-room." But, the call of duty.

several articles made of this novel kind of leather,
and has received complimentary testimonials from
several persons who have made purchases. If this
leather, is to become fashionabte. we shall start
skinning our poets at once. It will be the firs
chance we shaU have had of putting them to any
sensible use. But what a vista this new industry
opens Messrs. Addison and Yates will, we expect,
start the first tannery. They will have the advan-
tage of others in respect to having taken time by
Ih« forelock in the matter of gaining experience.
and Angelina .IttlM together,
ing all he has seen. This is likely to be a valuable
contribution to the lumber room. You remember
how once a Lord Mayor of London made a journey
to Oxford, which was celebrated by his chaplain,
Dillon, in a portly work [immortalised by Hood in
one of his best odes. Let us quote a few lines :—
“ Patron of Learning where she ne’er did dwell,
Where literature seldom finds abettors,
Where few— except the postman and his bell—
Encourage the belle lettres.
Well hast thou done, right honourable sir—
Seeing that years are such devouring ogresses.
And thou hast made some little journeying stir—
To get a Nichols I. to record thy Pro-
To take thine own pen* gr.sses.”
With the .alternation we have given in the final
line, this will suit His Excellency of Queensland’s
authorship exactly. But we, doubt not when the

shoes. Adolphus tapping his with his cane, says,
“Uncle Ned these—they wear well—he was a
tough old buffer. Who is yours?” To which
Angelina softly replies, looking down at her num-
ber 3’s, “Uppers, Aunt Jane; feel how soft they
are!—I was so fond of her, Adolphus—soles, ma’s
second husband: they won’t last long, he used to
drink and fall about too much.” But, thunder,
what a future will be opened to members of Par-
ment when this fashion comes into vogue 1 We
mean to the skins of members of Parliament. We
suppose they will be.used up for harness-leather.
They are thick enough, anyhow.

The Governor of Queensland made a tour
through the northern parts of his viceroyalty
lately. And now he is understood to be collecting
materials for the publication of a journal describ-
piece. Which suggests the curious speculation as
to whether, if a man had his head chipped off
gradually in small pieces, so as not to be taken too
much by surprise, he could not do as well without
it. If we were called upon to choose a safe subject
for such an experiment, whom should we name?
“Dan O’Connor?” No! “Andy Lynch?” No!
“Mudgee Taylor?” Nor yet him! Who, then ?

The Harmy say “Mr. Brereton has been

Mr. Brereton will keep being saved, but he can
take his oath that the Harmy will keep his farm.
We expect if Mr. B. at any time didn’t feel quite so
saved as he might wish, his face will assume a pen-
sive aspect when he thinks of those flocks that are
fatally faded. While on the subject of the Harmy,
we must quote a bit of Captain Veitoh, the hero of
the kettle. Nothing ever written was funnier than
this: “Bathurst Bombardiers. Our Battling, Blood
Bought, Bathurst Bombardiers are determined to
thrash the old devil at every point. On Sunday, at

juror was called, the good man and true in ques-

Says he: “ Once a person is arrested for drunken-
ness, his portrait should be taken and supplied to
every seller of liquor within a certain radius, and
they should be prohibited from supplying him or
her for a fixed period, on pain of the forfeiture of
their license and liquor.” Then he adds with
cheerful naSveU: “ Some law of this kind would, I
think, do a great deal of good.” So it would—to
the photographers. Every publican would then
be compelled to construct a portrait gallery as
long as a railway tunnel behind his bar. He would
certainly have the satisfaction of possessing a
collection of photographs of eminent men, if that
were any compensation. And when Dulcinea lost
the picture of her lover, or when an enthusiastic
elector wanted the portraits of some prominent
politicians, they would both know where to look.

Musing in graveyards has been a favourite
action from time Immemorial. It was a favourite
relaxation of the Prophet Jeremiah, in the inter-
vals of his Lamentations, to sit in the valley of dry
bones. Some of the old anchorites were never so
happy as when they were returning from a ceme-
tery with a 'ap full of skulls and shoulder-blades,
and the cheerful inhabitants of the catacombs
lived in apartments liberally festooned with rdics
of martyrs and decorated with the symbols of
death. Gray, as we had bitter cause to know in
the days when we wore young and guileless and
used to gamble away our school money, was much
given to sitting in a country churchyard when he
should have been in bed. And, lastly, a bard who
dwells in sun-smitten Yass has fallen into the same
gloomy habit. Ho shares it with the local goats.
Thunder! perhaps he is one of them. Anyhow, he
has written his mortuary reflections, and the
facetious compositors of the Yass Tribune have
chosen to set them up in a form previously used
for verse alone. To humour their uotion, we will
get our comps, to follow their example. [Note to
Foreman: Pay attention to this, or there will be
trouble. — Writer.] Now, then, for the first
“verse
“ In the lonely graveyard on the hill
Where the piercing winds sweep o’er,
Slumbering in deathly silence still
Are departed friends whom we deplore,
And mourn as dead because concealed
In the grave from human view.
Because those lips evermore are sealed—
In silence sealed to me and you.”
Quaint and original idea, isn’t it? The lips are
sealed! But why not corked? We suppose If they
were, this vampire would want to open them with
a corkscrew. Of course, he goes on to say that
the spirits of all those whose bodies lie below are
with the angels. They always are in obituary
poetry. Tell you what it is, if the angels are so
deuced careless about the company they keep, it
is not in their ranks we shall seek our society
when we ascend the everlasting ladder. One must
draw the line somewhere, and we most decidedly
do draw it at angels who hob-nob with every Tom,
Jack, and Harry of a soul that, after a life of little-
ness and potty piety here below, is rushed Into
heaven on a burst of psalmody at the last. But to
return to the bereaved bard of Yass. Here ia
another of his “versos
“ Sooner or later, we all must die.
As riches from death cannot redeem,
Then each with the other should vie
To leave the most lasting mark of esteem.
Valued by friends that have known us.
Long after has perished life’s flame,
With pride relations will own us
And claim to be friends of the name.”
The first line of this elegant extract contains a
profound and novel thought, but the second soars
above all praise. “ Riches from death cannot re-
deem.” This new conception of Death as a sort
of wholesale pawnbroker is worthy of the most
gifted intellect in Gladesville. The fine hurst of
lofty egotism in the succeeding lines aptly con-
cludes a poem after reading which the most
hardened sinner might die, serene in the know-
ledge that he had nothing more to fear. Some-
what feeble this paragraph, isn’t it ? But the
liquor has nearly died out of us, and the moon
shines coldly on the windows of the corner pub.

2,300,000,000 tracts have been distributed
by the Religious Tract Society since it started.
Judging by the return Of converts made since
then it would seem that it takes about a million
tracts to make a convert. Reading day and night
it would take an average man about ten years to
get through this number. And by the time he had
got halt through he would probably prefer to bo
damned in his ignorance than read the rest. We
would, anyhow, if we were in his place. Calcula-
ting another way, just for the curiosity of the
thing, we reckon that if the beat of Hell be set
down at, say, 500°, the gross quantity of tracts
issued by the Society would keep Hell going for a
year. This is a pleasant and useful thought, at
any rate.

This is the song of a Port Macquarie elegist

Ah, yes! he’s gone where grief’s no more.
His sorrows are all at an end.
Their bitterness Is past and o’er.
“Immortal spirits gone to enfold!” Is there no
law to protect the dead against this kind of thing ?
As to the second verse, we can only say: —
Yes, he is gone whom you did love:
And you'll have to look precious sharp,

COLONIAL CHAMPIONS OF THE
SCULL .
Just now, while the aquatic fever has laid
such a strong hold upon the general public, a re-
mmi of the men whojhave held the position or
champion of the Parramatta will not appear out
of place, and should prove a godsond to those or
our readers who would like to join in the general
aquaticshop talk, butare s uc:c up for material.
James Candlish. an importation frutn Newcastle-
on-Tyne, England, was the first to fancv the
present champion course would prove the best
available racing water near Sydney, and in 18o8the
first race was pulled on it—Candlish v. R. Green—
when Green defeated his opponent with the
greatest ease In 23min. 35sec. ; so, we suppose,
Dick Green may be looked upon as the first bona
fide champion of New South Wales. The winner
pulled in a boat put together by Messenger, ot
England, father of Charley Messenger who is no w
located at Double Bay. Tom M'Grath was the
next to make a bid for the championship, but was
unsuccessful, as R. Green, in a match for £300, de-
feated him, after a grand contest, in25mln. 31sec.
— Hood tii e and head wind. After this event
the idea of sending Green home to contend
for the championship of the Thames was
mooted, and in August, 1863, the wish
of the colonials was consummated, but not with
the result they so devoutly wished for, as R.
Chambers, the English champion, who had won
upwards of 100 races, put the colonial through in
35min. 35sec., over the Thames course from Putney
to Mortlake. Green led for a mile and a half, when
ho collapsed, and the Britisher won as ho liked. In
1865, W. Hickey, who many good judges consider
was the best man Australia ever saw, came to the
fore, and, after defeating H. White, he, on 30th
January, I860, met and defeated K. Green for £400
and the oj mpionship, in 25min.; and, on 34th
August, 1867, he again defeated Green in the
spiendid time—taking into consideration the way
the men were fixed up in those days— of 31min.
53aec. In the same year he again defeated Green,
after an unsatifsactory race, Green having run
ashore on the mile poll t. Hickey then had it all
his own way; and, in 1868, he challenged to row
any three men in Australia a three-mile race, to
pick up a fresh man at each mile, but met with no
response. In 1870, the genial Michael Rush first
appeared as a competitor for the championship,
but he had to give way to the invincible Hickey,
who won in Rush did not appear on
metropolitan waters again till 15th February, 1873,
when he defeated Hickey by six lengths and
carried off the championship ia 33min.35seo. On
10th September, Elias haycock and Edward
Trickett made their dthut on the Parramatta
River, and, after a desperate struggle, Trickett
won by six lengths in 25min. Trickett
was then sent homo to England to row Joe t-adler,
but why ho was looked upon as the champion in
place of Rush, who had defeated Hickey on the
Parramatta, and Tricaett, amongst others, on the
Clarence, we couli never understand, but home
he wont, and made such good use of his opportu-
nity that on 37th J une, 1876. he rowed and defeated
Sadler on the Thames in the most hollow manner,
in 34min 35scc. On his return to Sydney he pulled
Rush for the championship, when the Clarence
River man led for a mile, hut was eventually
beaten by Trickett in 23min. 26sec. However, this
did not prove Trickett’s superiority before he
went to England, as he pulled on a slide and Rush
on a fixed seat, and Trickett himself stated that he
had no idea he had so much to learn about rowing
till he went to Bnwland. Laycock and Trickett
met on 30th August, 1879, for the championship,
when Trickett won by nine lengths, in 23min.
On 12th April Laycock and Rush met for
£200, when the former won on the post in 32min.
28sec.; and in a return match, on the 5th of Sep-
tember following, he confirmed the win by again
putting Rush through his facings in 33min. 41se>s.
In 1880 the memorable match was fixed up between
Hanlan and Trickett, and it is hardly necessary for
us to inform our readers that when the men met
on the Thames, on the loth November of that
year, Hanlan defeated Trickett easily, and car-
ried off the world’s championship from Australia.
Laycock visited England at the same time as
Trickett, and did everything but defeat the. at
that time Invincible. Canadian. In a very abort
space of time he defeated William Blackman,
George Hosmer, and J. H. Riley; and received
forfeit from Hawdon, besides winning the £500
frize at the Hop Bitters Regatta; but on 14th
ebruary he suffered the usual fate at the hands
of Edward Hanlan, who again defeated Trickett
on the Thames in April, 1883. Laycock paid an-
other visit to England about this time, when he
was matched against Boyd, the English champion
The race took place on the Tees course, three and
a half miles, when Laycock won in the phenomenal
time ot i7min. 31sec. On March 10, 1883, Laycock
defeated Rush at the Grafton Regatta, and a
broken leg laid him on the shelf till the recent de-
feat by Edward Hanlan on the Nepean. Rush,
after winning the first prize for the Frank Punch
trophy, retired from the arena, and now Donald
M’Donald is looked upon as Champion of the
Clarence. But, though the old ’uns are laying up
on the shelf, wo have men just as good coming on
as fast and plentiful as blackberries, and in Beach,
Clifford and Matterson, we have material to work
upon for some years to come. William, or if we
don’t presume. Bill Beach, we are led to under-
stand, first saw the light in the little hamlet called
Loudon, England, in the year 1554, and in 1856
his parents brought him out to Australia and
settled down in the Illawarra district, where
they have continued to reside. William, in con-
tradistinction to the ex-champion, at an early age
evinced a great dislike to the water, and we have
it on good authority it was only by dint of catch-
ing him by the scruff ot his uec« andscrouging
bis head under the liquid that bis mamma could
persuaie him to take his morning tub. However,
the dislike wore off as he grew older, and he took
to rowing on the Illawarra Lake, where, on Feb-
ruary 7,1880, he was leading Clifford in a skiff race
when he broke a scull, and Clifford then had the
race to himself. Beach following him in with a
scull and a piece. Beach’s first bid for anything
like championship form was a race over the cham-
pion course with Ned Trickett on 28fh July, ’83,
when it blew heavily, and Beach being a bad hand
in rough water, was easily defeated in 20min. 15sec„
which time beat all previous records. A second
match was made, and the day proving fine. Beach
won the race from end to end. otill another mutch
was made, and the 27th August proving another
tine day. Beach rowed in splendid form and won in
SOrain. 44sec., which, taking the day into considera-
tion, is far and away the best time over made over
the championship course in a race. Beach made
an easy victory of the Hunt Trophy, after which
ho again defeated Ned Trickett on the Parramatta
in a match, and then he lay on his sculls till
his victory on Saturday last over Hanlan. The
Canadian, though not coming altogether under the
list of colonial champions, has been so intimately
connected with Australian scullers, hitherto to
their cost, that we do not think a record of his
wonderful match wins—unbroken till Saturday
last—will be out of place just here:—Beat Wallace

twenty-seven years of age, six feet high, and

International Regatta, held oh the Thames in 1880,
and his unsat sfact>ry meeting with Trickett on
the Thames. Trickett defeated Ross, but owing to
a foul the umpire ordered the race fo be rowed
over again, when Ross won with the greatest ease.
Poor Old Ned is now getting in the sere and yellow,
and he no doubt, prefers to play first violin in
Bananaland to second fiddle in the scene of his
former victories. He has challenged any three
men in Queensland to a three-mile contest—we
suppose a fresh man to pick him up at each mile.
But it is all in a life-time. As big a crowd
cheered him the night he arrived from England
with the as yelled at Beach last
Saturday night.

“ Gentleman saw Emily with basket month
ago. Moore Park, promised to call Nithsdale-street,

naturally be curious to know what was in the
basket.
Alfred says that “ coaches travelling over
black-soil roads up country carry spades to alg out

There is nothing wonderful about that. There is

The War Cbv:—“There are vacancies for
good War Cry sellers at open air ui'setiugs all

not in gore.
Charles Felu is the name of a Belgian
artist who has no hands or arms, and paints with

This, from a Cooma paper, is proof:—” Mr. C. Solo-

Beautiful thin", philosophy! Sir William

what a lot of study a man must have got through
to arrive at such a conclusion!
The Gunning Good Templars are an un-
reasonable lot. They wanted the Protestant
Standard sent to them gratuitously. The editor,

thing. It isn’t in human nature to do it.
Why ? A man died suddenly in Gundagai
lately. They buried him without an inquest. A

this. Again, why ? Surely a man may die sud-

We learn that “polite society likes eu-

“ The police are investigating a series of
frauds committed by a man who gave the name of

Melbourne Punch (which gets more and

upon the circum tance of one Brown announcing

A Surry Hills boarding-house keeper was

with him through knowing a reporter who boarded

When the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher isn’t
sparking with angels here below, he puts in a deal
of his time conferring with those above, and one
of his very latest experiences is that “ Ood’sangels
hold their noses whenever they look at a Wall-
street broker.” Next time Henry communes with
the white-robed harpers, he might oblige by en-
quiring what our celestial guardians hold when
taking stock of divorce court parsons and money-
grubbing deacons, who atone for six days of
swindling and fraud by humping collection plates

The trustees of the British Museum have
acknowledged the receipt of a giant platypus sent
by a Deniliauin gentleman. The people of Eng-
land must have a pretty good idea of the produc-
tions of Australia by this time. M’Elhone has been
among them, and they have gazed upon Henniker
Heaton. Neither of these phenomena is likely to
have upset the belief prevailing in the old country
that everything here is upside down. It only
needs that two or three others should go home to
rivet for ever the notion that in colonial public
life the bottom is always at the top.
A group of Tumut village-politicians were
talking over the present political situation. Said
one—we quote from the local paper: “All things
duly weighed and considered, while taking every
circumstance into account and accepting the logic
of facts without overlooking possible chances,
which should never be lost signt of, you may take
my word for it that if the present state of affairs is
indefinitely prolonged, we may have to wait a long
time before a change comes.” What a treasure
this man would be to the Treasurer, if he could
hire him to make his Budget speech! This is the
sort of luminous nebulosity that would have been
invaluable on the Ministerijl benches to explain
the Land Bill I
Political Points
Regarding the threatened conflict between
Lords and Commons over the Franchise BUJ, the
Times says that the Conservative chances on an
appeal to the country would be small. “ Neither
blunders in foreign policy nor even flaws in the
Franchise Bill itself would weigh tor a moment
against the vindication of the national will against
the obstructiveness of the hereditary Chamber.”
Anyone sitting in the gallery in the House
at the head of Bourke-street (Mel), and listening
to the chatter of the proud legislators underneath,
would, after a half hour's inspection, believe, as
Thersites believed of Achilles, that most of the wit
of the brilliant throng was stowed away in their
sinews. They look lit for something with a spark
in it, but rarely does the spark fly upwards. Their
best energies they reserve for expeditious and not
ungraceful promenades to the refreshment room.
It is, therefore, because a point of pungent wisdom
is such a rarity or. the floor of the House that we
feel inclined to hail with a flourish of trumpets the
expression of the feeling with which Mr. Zox re-
cently declared himself to be actuated. The Chief
Secretary was remonstrating with those members
who refuse to believe that the perfection of renre-
sentative government has been reached, acd he
wound up with, “ What's the matter with you ? ”
Mr. Zox replied: ‘‘We see you are comfortable.
We are not comfortable. That’s what's the mat-
ter.” Yes, Mr. Zox, A stupendous truth th -re
and everywhere.
“A more thoroughly venal and self-seek-
ing set of men than the English peers,” savs
Labouchere, “ does not exist on the globe.” It'is
impossible, he adds, to aay whether, in the coming
conflict with the Commons, the Loids “will be
more actuated by their hatred of democracy or by
their fear of coming into collision with demo-
cracy.” Professor Thorold Rogers, at a Liberal
demonstration, spoke plainly thus:—“The only
privileges the peers had on the statute book were
that they could walk in and out of a door before
his hearers and himself, and that they had the
right of being tided for murder by their own
class. They had had that right for the last two
centuries, and only one had been hangea. If he
were to tell them how many deserved to be
hanged, he should keep them listening to him
until the following morning. Why, h*lf of them
were absorbed in profligacy. Letthem look at the
records of the Divorce Court. These people were
being frequently brought forward for conduct
which was not found in anything like equal pro-
portion in an other class. He had heard of some
philosophers who said man had descended from
apes, and when he went into the House of Lords
ho began to fear that man would go back to apes.
What with their virtues and their vices, he uimost
failed to characterise them, ana he asked whether
the English nation would consent to be at the
mercy and caprice of such an irresponsible body
as the present House of Lords ?”
Tims does the shade of Dan O’Cbnnell, in
conversation with that of Isaac BoH (in Traill’s
“New Lucian’"),' refer to Parnell:—' Nornmcau
be more thoroughly well-equipped for the struggle
than he is. Abundant readiness, Immovable com-
posure, untiring Industry, a natural gift of frigid
Insolence which may easily pass for sarcasm, a
brain of crystal and a brow of brass—with such an
armament, he would be a man to be feared in any
Assembly, even if he had no nation behind him;
aad with such a backing t do not wonder that he is
winning the battle. His English enemies are bound
to reckon with him if only as a parliamentary
power at every turn; and their most accomplished
experts in House of Commons tactics have no
choice but to make terms with one who can wield
their own weapons more skilfully than themselves.
He has made himself a consummate master of all
their forms of procedure; he has studied their
rules as a prisoner’s attorney scrutinises an in-
dictment. He refutes their parliamentary pundits
out of their own text books, and trips up the
Speaker himself with th« authority of the more
learned officer who sits before him. He knows
when to irritate by technical objections, when to
sting by insult, when to scandalise by violence of
speech: and he rarely resorts to any one of these
methods without success. No wonder that his
countrymen who daily watch the unwieldy English
Parliament floundering under his dexterous blows
like a harpooned whale in a ‘flurry ’—no wonder, I
say, that they should exult in his prowess and
resolve with ever-growing enthusiasm to increase
his power.”

buted by Thomas Gibson Bowles to the Fort-
nightly for June, we note the subjoined shame-
less passage;—“The Press has never yet been
officially recognised. Beer and banking, rlohe?,
romance and poetry have been ennobled, baron-
etcies have been showered on lord mayors, sheriffs,
and doctors; musio-masters have been knighted,
but never yet has the fountain of honour flowed
even for the ablest, most enterprising, and moat
successful of those who have organized with so
much success the dally brains of the nation.
There are men among them who can challenge
comparison, either for personal qualities and at-
tainments, or (or personal position in the country,
with any brewer or banker ever raised to the
House of Lords ; but they only represent brains,
and brains, though unofficially courted, and se-
cretly coaxed, and sometimes abjectly entreated
in private, are not yet officially recognised in pub-
lic as an existing force in the daily life of Great
Britain. It may be that the time will come when
this also will be changed, if so, it will he well." If
I so, it will not by any means be well. What good
can possibly be hoped for from tricking out Press-
men in trumpery titles ? W hat truly Independent
man cares a tinker’s dam for the sordid favours of
a Court? What would official recognition mean
but that they who dispense the patronage will
expect a quid pro quo in the shape of butter?
What could possibly be a more degrading spectacle
than that of Government rewarding the news-
paper man, and the newspaper man paying homage
to the Government ? What else from such an ar-
rangement could be expected than the servility of
the Press, and the decay of Independent criticism.
There are too many venal scribes in the ranks of
the Fourth Estate as it is: It would be a terrible
thing were official recognition to encourage their
increase. From official recognition, Domine libera
nos at all events.
Everyone ha* read of the abortive attempt
recently made by Mr. Woodall, M.P.. to tack on to
the English Franchise Bill a clause conferring the
suffrage on lovely woman. Lovely woman, or
rather a mo*t unlovely section of her, wishes to
vote—wishes especially to have a voice In making
the laws affecting women and children. “ Give us
the custody of our children I” shriek Dr. Anna
with the blue nose and Dr. Mary with the bottle-
curls and eye-glass. “ Give old maids the custody
of their children I ” yelled an Irish member during
the debate-“what next!” Which reminds one
that there was the other day published in the
London dailies a list of 20 ladies of position who
had formed themselves into a committee to bring
about female suffrage. Of the twenty, it is a some-
what remarkable fact that nine were old maids
who have arrived at about the fifth age of woman,
the other eleven being marrlea women who have
exactly three children between them. The Com-
mons were asfwell canvassed on behalf of the
clause as was the N.8.W. Assembly (by interested
ladies) in favour of the lately-enacted Judges’-
Salaries-and-Pension Bill. At a caucus of ladies
held at the bouse of Mrs. Coleridge-Kennard some
most wonderful arguments were advanced in favor
of the movementh-it was urged, for instance, that
the fact that men and women occupied different
legal positions in respect to the matter of adultery
and divorce was a striking evidence that men, in
making laws, unjustly gave themselves privileges
that they were most careful to withhold from
women. Jt did not appear to bo understood by
the fair orator that wnile designing woman could
palm off on her husband a child of which he was
not the father (and such frauds have been perpe-
trated on one or two occasions, even in Sydney;, it
would be rather hard for a husband to induce his
wife to believe she was the mother of what Sara
Bernhardt w.ould call one of his “little accidents."
It was quite evident that Mr. Woodall's motion
was a thinly-veiled Conservative dodge, the vast
majority of women being Incorrigible Tories. The
disappointed dears and their wire-pullers arc now
going to see whether they can’t get legislation on
their own behalf initiated amon the old women
of the Lords. When the question comes to be
seriously debated, there will be a magnificent
chance for one of the golden-mouthed Radicals to
formulate a brilliant Parliamentary oration, hav-
ing for its text, “Yes, enfranchise the women—
when you have enfranchised the men.” During
the debate, several Tory members actually had the
impudence to say that because a man was com-
pelled by poverty to live with his wife and family
in one room—and there are in England scores of
thousands so compelled—he was not tit to 1 ie trusted
with the franchise. The effect of the present Bill
will be to add to the electoral lists many thousands
of voters, chiefly Radicals. To quote the Specta-
tor: “ Women have never gained so much in the
rectification of the real injustice to which their
sex has been subject, as during the last few years*
and they have gained it in the legitimate way, by
using the social influence they will always possess,
unless they sacrifice it by entering the political
lists, and losing in influence much more than they
seek to gain in power. If their cause prospers,
they may find one day that political gain may prove
to be intellectual and moral Joss.”

Those regular Dei gratia blockheads, Pious

inconvenience of summer travelling in a suit of

his bomb-proof salle a manger is rome enough for

field's laurel wreath. One American journal re-
rakes up his Credit Mobllier and De Colyer record
Another puts it that if Garfield was good enough
nor Blaine norTilden can consistently be scouted
on the score of virtue or lack thereof. While
another sees in Garfield a second-rate machine
politician whom the mad extravagances of grief
and rage have orowmd with an unreal fame, that
the pitiless hand of history will rape away. And
hundreds more whistle the same tune.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
[Correspondent who give neither name nor nom-de-
plume cannot expect to have their com-
munications noticed .]
“ W.G.” : Thanks for your suggestion, but
we are almost tired of trying to “shoot folly as it
flies.” It is always flying. We have whipped the
lollies of all sorts of men, from Ministers of the
Crown to ministers of the Looard. We have not
been frightened by the wealth or awed b' the
position of the persons of whose folly we made a
tirget. But it is in vain. There are people born
to be fools, upon whom satire is wasted. Perhaps
—who knows?—in the great economy of the uni-
verse these people have a place and a mission.
They must have. Worms have. Toads have.
Toad-eaters, too Henniker Heatons also. Then
what is the use of kicking against the pricks?
Even Goethe had to acknowledge this. We give
you Sir Theodore Martin’s translation of Goethe’s
“Coptic Song ”:—
“ Howe’er they may wrangle, your pundits and
sages,
And love of contention Infects all the breed.
All the philosophers, search through all ages,
Join with one voice in the following creed:
Fools from folly ’ti« hopeless to stay I
Mules will be mules, by the law of their mullsh-
ness;
Then be advised and leave fools to their foolish-
ness,
What from an ass can be got but a bray ?”
This is almost as well as we could put it ourselves.
We will say this for Goethe, that, though he did
die without seeing us. he knew, as far as his lights
went, a thing or two in his own generation. Sc,
now. “ W.G.’, you have heard the opinions of the
greatest philosopher of the last century and the
noblest Intellect of this on the matter, and we
think you should be fairly satisfied. “J.P.T.C”:
Try again “R.A.”: Some of the verses are not
wanting in merit, but what of such knock-kneed
and commonplace stanzas as—
“Then out doth burst a bad misnomer,
Worse by far than is in Homer
Or Will Shakespeare;
“ Whence out of bed this fellow gets,
And to a neighbouring pub. he sets
With motions queer ” ?
...“Nimitybelle” : Your neighbour with the hair
trunk on his top Up, probably considers vour pigs,
like yourself, have too much cheek. That’s why
he shoots them. Keep inside, or he’ll por you, and
no jury in the land will dare convict him
“Maori” : Don’t mind the dawg. He lain train
just now to make war on the Spring poets. Send
along more sparkles, but above all —be moral
“ Argus Critic”: It’s hard enough to have to spell
out your rather eccentric pot-books, without read-
ing afterwards a criticism in which we’re not in
the f aintest degree interested, and which measures
two feet: two feet, about your size? “ W. 8.

The Referee
SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
We understand a Riverina town holds the
coming man in the aquatic line.
At Birmingham, Myers won the half-mile
in Imin. 55 3-5sec., which beats his own best pre-
vious record, and is the fastest time for an amateur
in either England or America.
Dan O’Leary still hankers after another
match with our only Edwards, and has challenged
him for a six-days’ walk for £300. Edwards has
now gone over to England for a trip.
In Adelaide the Jockey Club is making a
big bid for the reinstatement of the totalisator in
South Australia. A petition has been started, to
which It is expected some 30,000 signatures will be
obtained.
The North Shore Rowing Club regatta,
fixed for 27th September, will include a four-oar
outrigger raoe, open to all clubs, for oarsmen who
have never won a senior race at a public regatta,
or an Intercolonial oar-race.
At recent Scottish championship sports,
hold at Edinburgh, J. M. Cowie, of the London
AtbleticClub, carried off the 100 yards in 10 1-5 sec.,
and the quarter-mile in 511-5 sec., so that he is now
champion at those distances for both England and
Scotland.
Mr. T. M. Aloook, of the Haymarket, had
more luck on the track than on the wafer last
week. His handsome imported trotter, Midnight,
took first prize in the buggy class. Midnight is
by Elmo out of Maggie, and was bred by Mr. Seale,
of San Francisco.
This is the funniest thing we have read for
a long time: “ A female pedestrian who is walk-
ing one thousand miles in a thousand hours, near
Glasgow, has been considered guilty of Sabbath
desecration. The Lord Advocate has been com-
municated with.”
Young Stevens has just completed a couple
of two-streak outriggers for Press, of Woolloo-
mooloo Bay, for letting-out purposes. The style
should prove first-class for rowing club practice
boats, being light and fast, and still strong enough
to stand knocking about.
A lady was set on Are—the second during
the week—in the Master of the Buokhounds en-
closure at Ascot recently, either by a cigar or the
bead of an unburnt fuzee. Two gentlemen threw
their coats around her and extinguished the fire,
but not before she was seriously injured.
The London Referee says of the race in
which Hanlan beat Laycock by half-a-length only:
“Naturally, with Beach looking on, and with a
match impending between him and Hanlan, it was
not likely the latter would extend himself, espe-
cially as extension was in no way necessary.”
The Suburban Bicycle Club have fixed
upon 13th September for their race meeting on the
Association Ground. The programme will be one-
mile maiden open Handicap; three-mile club race;
two-mlle challenge (rather dubious, this); one-
mile open; three miles open; one-mile trike; and
150-yards open foot handicap.
Betting at amateur athletic meetings in
England has become such an institution that the
reporters found it necessary to quote the prices in
reporting the various events at a recent champion-
ship meeting at Birmingham—a thing unprece-
dented in tne annals of amateur athletics. We
are not quite so advanced this side of the water.
Not on land, at all events.
In England, the recent five-miles bicycle
championship, held under the auspices of the
National Cyclists’ Union, resulted in a win for
R. Chambers, of the Speedwell Bicycle Club, from
which club our one-mile champion hails. All the
other competitors retired before the termination,
but Chambers kept on to try and beat the Union
Standard—15min lOsec. A loose path and light
wind were against him, and he finished in 15mm.
36 4-5 sec.
“ Bicyclists.—Meeting of new bioyole club,
Emu Inn, George-street, opposite Cathedral, Tues-
day night, 8 30 pm” This is an advertisement in
a recent D.T , and in a previous issue we saw it
stated that the new club wlH be formed with a
view of comprising both amateurs and profes-
sionals. There is no club in Sydney at present
open to pros., and we should think an amateur
joining the proposed club would not be recognised
by the Union.
Like all the other papers, we had our ac-
count of the big race, or rather the scene up the
River, all ready written out during the preceding
week, but it wouldn’t gee, as, by some means, the
telling points we had worked up for the occasion
—coign of vantage, delirium tremens of excite-
ment- beautiful harbour—pink of condition—
10,000 000 people—giant roars—and many others
equally as telling—were all forestalled by the
dailies, so we tore our copy up in disgust, and
swore to stick to the race proper. Beach, in the
buff, towered over his smaller opponent, who
rowed as usual in his blue guernsey, and, at some
20 minutes past four, the men struck the water
very evenly and started away on their eventful
journey. A nasty south-wester was blowing, and
Beach, having the southern position, held his own
for a few strokes, but Hanlan, pulling with
his wonderful dash, soon drew away from his
opponent, seeming to gain feet every stroke, but,
before the milo poin was reached, an event
occurred which very nearly put a t rmination to
the race, and a blot upon our reputation for fair
play. The Tomki, Beach’s boat, which started a
long way too far down the river, appeared to get
quite unmanageable, and drifted right across
Hanlan’s course, and the ex-champion must be
possessed of iron nerves if his heart did not
thump his ribs when, in answer to a shout from
somewhere, he looked over his right shoulder
and saw the immense mass of iron looming over
him. However, by pulling hard with his right he
ma 'aged to escape the threatened danger;—when
Beach had to iro through the same danger, which
he did in rather better style than Hanlan, who
caught what looked remarkably like a thorough-
bred crab just after getting out of the difficulty.
When the men again settled down, the Canadian
contrived to draw away, and at the mile point
(shot in 6 min. 9sec.) he had a lead of some three
lengths. Beach then s ttled down, and with in-
domitable pluck spurted in chase of the leader.
At Breakfast Point it was seen Beach was gaining
rapidly—Hinlan pulling desperately at 38. Beach
doing a couple or strokes less; and shortly after
passing the Point, the hitherto invincible Hanlan
collapsed, and Beach dashed right into him. Hanlan
lifted his hand and claimed the “ foul,” but Beach
pulled straight on as soon as he got clear. After
this little contretemps, the race requires no descrip-
tion, as the Canadian seemed to be pumped out
and did not persevere, and Beach rowed in, the
easiest of winners, in 21 minutes 16% seconds.
Hanlan rowed over into Beach’s water, and it is
needless to say Mr. Clark would not entertain the
protest. The race was rowed, for the greater part,
in choppy water, and has completely thrown over
the popular idea that Beach was lost in anything
of a jump. Of the two, the Dapto : an was most
at home in the rough water, and we are of opinion
that If Hanlan is destined to win back the “ qham-
pio iship of the universe” —how is it the jaynll
Dan never thought of this Improvement on the
“ championship of the world ?” —It will be on a
calm day. Hanlan rowed in the last boat turned
out by Edwards, of Melbourne, and It strikes us
he must have held his opponent rather cheap to
row such an important race in a boat which he
had stepped into a day or so before the race. Heach
rowed in his Donnelly and Sullivan—the men, by
the way, who gave him the opportunity ox ms
dtibut on metropolitan waters—and Tommy Kelly,
a Sydney man, trained him; so that the win has
been New South Wales In every particular.
We have received rather a long list of per-
formances from J. C. Williams, who signs himself
“ long-distanoe walker of Australia.” J.C. was
born In 1833, but his soles still go marching on, and
he now states he Is willing to make a match to
walk any man in the world “longest distance with-
out leaving the track.”
Wiloannia takes the cake for the novel
boat race of the season. The competitors were a
gay Majah, who had for a partner the young lady
who dispenses gin-slings at the local Petty's, and
a Mr. Stanbury, who pulled in the same boat with
a lady from the local Thompson and Giles, The
distance was three-quarters of a mile, and the
gallant Majah and his fascinating partner, who,
by the way, had trained hard pulling at the beer
engine, won by any number of lengths, in some-
thing under three quarters of an hour.
The following proposition was carried by
the Horsham (Q.) Athletic Club on 8th August:—
“ That A. J. Farrell, of Sydney, who ran under the
assumed name of M‘Arthur at last sports, and won
the principal event of the meeting wrongfully—he
having misled the handlcappers by entering as a
maiden runner-be disqualified from ever running
at any sports held in connection with this club,
and that the secretary be instructed to write to
the various clubs, informing them of the disquali-
fication of Farrell,” Comment is needless—and
expensive.

mile in 2min. 39 3-5sec. I
The old 24-footer Wyvern, a very old love
of ours, built by Yates, and a clipper in her day,
has been purchased by a gentleman long connected
with open boat sailing, who purposes fitting her
up in style as a pleasure boat for the coming
season. It will indeed be like old times to see the
Wyvern in commission again. We always looked
upon her as the beauAdcal of an open pleasure
boat, stiff as a house, sailing faster than the ordin-
ary run. and, if the wind dropped, pulling like a
Bkiff. The Wyvern did some fast work in her day,
with Colebrook at the tiller, and we remember on
one occasion when the Coryhene was leading her
on the run home from Manly during a race sailed
In a black North-easter, that Tom cracked on a
squaresaii and topsail, and the gallant little boat
fettlng her shoulder under water, staggered like a
runken man. and then rolled into the gutter; and
bow the Sea Breeze, which was running after her
like a race horse with Sam Richardson—we think—
at the tiller, rounded up to the rescue, and bring-
ing the sheet in too fast, also came to grief, the
two boats leaving 28 men struggling in the water;
and how one dashing young blade In the Breeze
nearly came to grief, which catastrophe, had it oc-
curred, would have spoilt an interesting event to
come off shortly at a popular watering place. But,
there, we had better put a clapper on our pen, or
we shall be filling The Bulletin with our musty
remlnlscenses.
Smith, of the London
Rowing Club, a regular
outsider, won the diamond
sculls at Henley, beating
Lowndes, whose defeat, as
he has been for years past
such a “ moral r for the
event, caused some sensa-
tion.
Raynor, the ped.,
writes deprecatlngly on
the subject of our treating
him, as he terms It-“sar-
castically.” His letter at
cnee suggests the fact that
he must, while writing It,
have made full use of the
dictionary. Only it was
the dictionary of—another
language.
In the match Ameri-
can Gentlemen v. Glouces-
tershire, W. G. Grace’s
wicket was each time
taken by Newhall, who, in
the first innings, got him
caught for 18, and, in the
second, clean bowled him
for 11. In 1871, W. G.
Grace, playing for the
Twelve Gentlemen of
England against Twenty
of Philadelphia, was taken
each innings by C. A New-
hall, who in the first in-
nings clean bowled the
champion for 14, and in
second got him caught
for 7. Tne coincidence is
curious.
In the Oxford-Cam-
brldge cricket match, that
usually brilliant cricketer,
Mr. Timothy O'Brien, who
had taken £75 to £1 that
he didn’t score 100 in either
Innings, made a pair of
duck’s eggs. Whereupon,
the undergraduates said
his right name was “O.
O’Brien.” and began to
sing “ Won’t you tell me
why, Brian ?' r Mr. Rock,
who made so good a stand
for Cambridge in the
second innings, is a Tas-
manian, who, in addition
to proving himself a first-
class cricketer, has taken
two scholarships at Cam-
bridge.
At Brazilian races the
“ welsher ” hasn’t even an
“outside show.” “The
professional bettors are
locked up in a large build-
ing with grated windows
at Intervals, at which they
bet with the public, giving
tickets to record the trans-
action and attest the re-
ceipt of the money; when
the race is over, the win-
ners repair to another
window, and, on present-
ing their tickets, they are
paid their winnings.” This
plan could, we think, only
be Improved on in one
way; and that would be
by locking up a very stiff
percentage of the profes-
sional bettors in a large
building with grated win-
dows—say Darlinghurst—
and not allowing them to
bet with the public at all.
We notice that the
“ official ” time—whatever
that means—for the big
race has been given by the
various dailies as 3Umin.
38sec., but we are not tar
out when we state that the
“ correct” time was nearly
a minute slower. We made
it Slmln 26%sec; an experi-
enced amateur, used to
clocking, made it Sltnin.
27sec.; and Mr. James
Oatley, perhaps as ex-
perienced a hand with the
watch as followed the
race, made it21min. 29sec.;
so there cannot be much
doubt that the official
timekeeper—it there was
such a person—ran the
dailies all astray. The
third mile in the alleged
time of 6mln. 15eeo. is too
preposterous to need com-
ment.
We are in a position to give a tip for the
Melbourne Cup. Commotion at 9st. 13lb. ought
to be not far away from the next horse, when
Malua and Le Grand are next some horse near. At
the same time we should not bo surprised to find
Sir Modred turning up the straight full of as much
going as Sir Modred or Martini-Henry, in case
Guesswork or Welcome Jack do not carry their
owners' colours somewhere near something or
other. We fancy, however, that Sweet William
might require fancying for certain reasons. This
Is gratis to the general reader, and will save him
the trouble of going through the other tipsters.
We understand that “stroke” of the losing
four at the recent M.tt.C. regatta twisted his out-
rigger when he caught the first of the series of
crabs which occurred during the race. If such
was the case we were rather rough in our report
of the race. But, at the same time, wo are of
opinion still that he rows a great deal too fast and
scratchy to get in effective work, and he would
want men behind him with the staying powers of
a horse to keep going with him. He comes of a
family noted for their bottom, and it really seems
a pitv he has not dropped into a better style. He
should row for a season behlna a man with a good
awing.
In England, the Military Tournament
at the Agricultural Hall proved a big event. One
of the most interesting displays was the skirmish-
ing practice of the 3rd and 15th Hussars. The
docility of the horses was wonderful. With
scarcely any difficulty each animal was induced to
lie on his side, and the troopers, taking cover
| behind their chargers, fired volley after volley
with their carbines. As the horse rose to his feet the
Hussar stepped across him, and, rising with the
animal, was In his saddle in an instant. For the
wrestling on horseback the 4th Irish Dragoons
carried all before them, tumbling the burly Life-
guardsmen out of their saddles with the greatest
ease.
Both Matterson and Edwards are stated to
be in good fettle for their match next Saturday.
The race on the Nepean cannot be taken as any
criterion of the men’s powers, as Matterso i had a
handicap in his favour and Edwards was com-
pletely thrown out of it by one of the competitors.
Matterson pulls in a remarkably clean style, so far
as his sculls are concerned, but he shows a great
lack of swing. Edwards is stated to be a bit off
since his knocking about with Hanlan; but, If the
report is without foundation, and Robert is the
Bob Edwards of old, we fancy he will give the
coming young ’un all he knows to finish in front
of him. We don’t give this as a tip. Since last
Saturday we’re “ off It.”
Northern journalists are kicking them-
selves for Joy over the fact that Ned ’Irickott’s
advent has given a “ sort of impetus to aq uatio
matters in Rockhampton.” Like “mobled queen,”
a “sort of Impetus” is good, but, so far as our
experienca goes, is must be a mighty sick sort of
Impetus indeed. We also learn that Edward is
giving a prize to be rowed for at the forthcoming
regatta, but whether the trophy is to take the
shape of a second-hand coffin or a gill of rum in a
ginger-bottle is not at present made known to the
general public. And this reminds us that, when, a
few nights after the gonial, boisterous, rollicking
Ned opened “Trickett’s Folly Hotel” down here,
a particular sort of cuss indignantly asked if his
host meant to insult him by offering him a glass of
port wine hot without a single taste of nutmeg in
it. Edward apologised; said he was only getting
experience, ran the hired girl out for 5s. worth of
the aromatic nuts, and, for a month after that,
every glass of brandy, gin, tanglefoot, &e.—hot or
cold—which was served by Ned was buried under
an inch and a half of nutmeg.
We are in for more thrilling events in the
athletic line. Donald Dianio has written the fol-
lowing to the Melbourne Sportsman:— “ Sir, In
reply to Clarence Whistler, the champion Graeco-
wre*tler of America, I ha ve to say that I
will wrestle him the best of five styles, and allow
him to choose three of the five, for any sum over
£50 a-side. Regarding expenses, I came to this
country at my own expense to meet all comers,
and, as Mr. Whistler wishes to come over, I see no
reason why ho should expect £100 towards ex-
penses. He can have the match for £500: so that,
if he wins, he will be well remunerated.” Should
the men meet, wo should like to hear from Dinnie,
before the event, what he intends to do—or he may
give us a little more after the match of what he
could have done, d la the Miller and Victor affair.
Miller Is getting about again, and a complimentary
dinner to him has been fixed for the 39th instant.
We are rather anxious to see the Professor him-
self again. Then, Donald, look out for squalls.
In commenting upon the recent sale of
Lord Falmouth’s horses, London Bell’s Live says:
—“It may be Interesting at the present time to
mention the most important sales that have pre-
ceded Lord Falmouth’s. Iu the early days of the
century it was the practice to offer a stud privately
in one lot, but it is not until 1846 that we come to
any sale of great public interest. We refer to the
stud of Lord George Bentinck, which was first
offered to Mr. Payne for lO.OOOgs., and, on refusal,
Mr.—subsequently Lord—Mostyn became the pur-
chaser. In 1853, Mr. Padwick gave 15,000gs. for
General Anson’s thoroughbreds, and this lot In-
cluded Scythian, the Cheater Cup winner In 1855.
In later years Sir Joseph Hawley’s stud was the
first important one placed under the hammer. This
was at Middle Park in 1873, when the whole of the
stud—including the stallions Rosicruelan and Side-
rollte—brought what was then considered the
remarkable amount of close on 34,000gs. Rosa
Bonheur, Marie Stuart, and Fraulem all realised
heavy prices on subsequent occasions for brood
mares, and the last-named pair have never thrown
anything worthy their reputation. The Middle
Park sale wisa very sensational one, and the price
given for Blair Athol, 13,500gs., was regarded as
about the height to which the price of a stallion
could reach; but this was put in the shade when
the Duke of Westminster gave 14,000gs. for Don-
Cister. Tae rapid strides in the value of equine
blood stock is shown by the prices consistently
paid for the best lots at the dispersal of the Cor-
nish Earl's stud, and while we can only regret the
ill-health that has caused his Lordship to retire
from the turf, we may congratulate ourselves on
the pick of the lots having fallen into the hands of
thorough sportsmen,”
We publish the following letter, at the re-
quest of Mr. George Ellis, the well-known boat-
builder of Water view Bay:—“I beg to thank you
for the notice of my extension of business con-
tained in your last Issue, and, at the same time, to
take exception to your statement that I am second
to Donnelly and Sullivan as a boat-builder. Seeing
that the public place considerable reliance upon
your reports relative to sporting matters, the
opinion you express is calculated to injure my
reputation, and 1 therefore trust you will do me
the favour of publishing this letter, I do not
consider myself second to anyone in Australia,
either as a boat-builder or at the tiller, and am
prepared to back myself and boats against anyone
for any reasonable amount; or, to talk business, I
am prepared to sail the Dreamland against any
34-foot open boat in the harbour, best and best,
over the Manly course, for (say) £50 to £100 a side.
Man, money, and boat ready at a week’s notice.
I mention 34-foot boats, as that is the class to
which you specially refer as being Donnelly’s
strong point, but I shall be only too glad to make
a match for any boat of my building with any-
thing of the same class. I am, &c., G. W. Ennis ”
We are sorry Mr. Ellis should have taken the para-
graph he refers to In the light he did, for nothing
was further from our Intention than to cast any
reflections upon the work of such a clever boat-
bnilder. Ho tar as handling the tiller is concerned,
wo have always been of opinion that since George
Montgomery died, Ellis has no peer in the harbour ;
but we must still adhere to our belief that he has
never yet built a boat able to beat either the Car-
lotta, Victor, or tne 33-footer Rosetta, whatever
he may do in the future. As affairs now stand, his
challenge is not likely to be taken up; but were
the Carlotta in the hands of her old owner. Mr.
S. H. Hyam, wo have an idea the offer would not
long go begging.
In their training fo J ’
their annual race with
Yale, the Harvard crew
were allowed ice-cream
and cake I But even in
this direction the noble
Australian outshines the
Yankee, Three years ago,
one of the Sydney crew,
in training for the Inter-
colonial boat-race, was al-
lowed to go away and get
married. We suppose the
cake allowed to the Yan-
kees wasn’t wedding-cake.
Mr. Courtney, the
great American oarsman,
has now, it is declued by
one paper, "plainly proved
himself a coward and a
sneak.” H i s record is
given as follows In
lfcu3, at Philadelphia, his
boat hung on the top of a
barge in the boat- bouse
ot the Philadelphia Boat
Club. The bottom was
sawed out of it. In 1877,
when he was pitted against
Kiley at Greenwood Lake,
he was alleged to have
lahen poisoned tea. In
1877, at Geneva Lake, his
boat was upset through
reported sunken wires. In
18(7, for the third time in
that year, when he was to
have rowed against Riley
and Plalsted, he had an
alleged sunstroke two
miles out. In 18711, at La-
chine, in his match with
Hanlan, he was suddenly
"•hen with a sore wrist.
In 1879 again, his boat was
sawed at Chautauqua
Lake. In 1879, at Wash-
ington, in another match
with Hanlan, he had a
second visitation of sun-
stroke. In 1883, at Geneva
Lake, he had his boat
packed up, and refused to
row. In 1883, at Watkins
Glen, he claimed that
somebody hit him on the
back 01 the neck with a
sand club. On June 7,
1884, he suddenly disap-
peared.”
.Weller, senior, alleged
that a man who can form
an ackerate judgment of a
hoes can form an ackerate
judgment of anything.”
The history 0 f Tom Ward,
the Yorkshire groom,fully
bears Weller out. A good,
steady, light-weight joc-
key. in 1833, he went to
Vienna in charge ot some
nags, and was at once
taken under the wing of
the sporting Duke of
Lucca, whose aim in life
was to lick England on
the turf. From jockey and
trainer. Ward climbed up
to confidential valet, and
thence to keeper of the
privy purse. Next he ap-
pears as a Baron, and be-
fore long took the role of
Minister of Finance, al-
though he was practi-
cally Pr me Minister, and
a leading political power
the Austrian events
°f 184i-1848. Tom Ward
spoke French, Italian, and
German as fluently almost
as his own Anglaise, and, as
a diplomatist, was as re-
markable for his honesty
as his shrewdness. After
the death of the Duke of
Lucca (known in his latter
years as Duke of Parma,
on account of his acces-
sion to that duchy) Tom
Ward took to farming,
ana spent many years m
peaceiul Independent re-
tirement. Tom’s history
ranks as one of the most
remarkabie in connection
with the turf. He was al-
ways familiarly known to
the Italians as “Signor
Tommaso.”

The bachelors of North Shore gave a grand
ball last Friday, in Myers' Assembly Hall, having
lor their guests the Hite, the beauty, and the
fashion of that suburb. Most of thefladies toilettes
were exceedingly handsome and stylish, and so
fascinating were their wearers that the bachelors
could not resist the appeals for “ extras, of which
n number was given, to the line music of Koptf
and Austin’s band. On the regular programme
were 18 dances, 12 being walt/.es, and, curiously,
they wore all put in pairs, with a change dance in
between; "Let's have a dance ere we are
married ” was the appropriate motto on the cards,
and quite likely this urgent appeal to the St.
Leonards belles will result in even more Interest-
I n$r events hein# “oiittio cards” someday, 11 all
goes well. Baumann’s catering was voted excel-
lent by the men and maids who combined to re-
peatedly attack the well-spread tables, and one of
the happiest affairs the Shore has seen was closed
liy the guests departing about 3 a.m.

On Saturday night, the annual dinner of
the Kngine-driversand Firemen’s Association took
place in the Masonic Hall, York-street. About 140
sat down—sterling, intelligent men. There were
no masher collars on the enginemen, no “dross”
suits; but they sat there with their bold, bronzed
faces and brawny shoulders, like men who have
more serious work in life than studying their
toilet in a looking-glass. There were men from all
parts of the colony down for their annual meet,
and they greeted one another from the far-off lines
with a frank and hearty welcome that no
affected lisp in it —with the bluff and fearless tone
fitting to be used by men who drive “ the mighty
monarebs of the road.” Mr. H. J. Bland occupied
the chair, having on one aide the Hon. Alexander
Stuart (Premier) and Mr. Angus Cameron. M.P.;
on the other side the Hon. John Sutherland, M P.,
and Mrs. Cobb. The banquet took about an hour,
and the provides cannot be complimented on his
supply. There was not even enough of ordinary
edibles; and, as the supply of wine wa« inlluf-
teslmnl. the enginemen drank most of the toasts in
ale. Of course, the chairman’s table, where in-
vited guests sat, was well locked after. Songs
were given at intervals, and Herman’s band
played. Mr. Campling proposed ” Parliament,”
and Messrs. Stuart, Sutherland, and Cameron re-
plied; but, curiously enough, the toast was not
drunk. Mr. Bland proposed the " Railways,” and
Mr. Harrison gave "Our Holidays.” Mr. J. Heron
proposed “Our Invited Guests,” and the Premier
made a flong [speech in reply, just a trifling ram-
bling. but interesting to his audience. Messrs. Mid-
dleton, D C MoLachlan, S agur, Cobb. &c, also
replied. “The Euginemen's Association ” was the
subject of a neat and pithy speech by Mr. D.
Moore, and the health of Mr. vVm. Sixsmith, the
oldest engine-driver in the colonies, w«s drunk,
other t lasts occupied till nearly midnight, when
the social gathering separated.

Molong both represented; the former by a brunette

proved attractive; also her friend, in black moire.

in demand, as usual Marsh-street sent two -isters
in cream and cardinal, and Lord’s-place a little one
i i black lacs arid satin. Two blondes were from
vnson-street-one in cream, the other in black and
time sash; and two sisters from the vicinity of the
Exchange found many admirers.

Last Monday, the Balmain Private Assem-
t.y held its first social da-jee in the School of Arts.
Toough starting late in the season, t he committee
nave earnestly determined not to be behindhand
iu (heir pleasure, and it is intended to have three
more meetings even now before the warm weather
nets in. Mr. W. Mitchell, as hon. sec., and his
colleagues did their best to make everyone at ease,
<tnd when the dance closed about midnight all their
guests went away as pleased as the proverbial
Punch. Music was by DeGroen, the floor in good
order, and the catering of Mr. Oldham excellent.
Such affairs as these are not supposed to be exhibi-
lionB of elaborate dress-lt would be unwise to
make them so; but neatness and grace are truly
always worth a word. And these were certainly
not lacking among the company. A tall, fair
iadv in broche silk of Indigo blue wqs commend-
able- a pert little dancer from Prince Alfred Park
merry in cardinal and pink; and two young ladies,
whose pa '8 in the stationery line, did not care
about being stationary themselves—one in blue
looked well, and one in white never waited long
Tor nartnersto Turn’er. Two other sisters in white
•md blue, respectively, were from Red fern, and
mI wavs had knights near them—which was only
natural because they are Castles. A brilliant
■Rrise satin and white lace suited a married lady

velvet and white puffed silk skirt most prettily
made Extremely graceful as a dancer was a

Frklav at Nithsdale Rooms. Balls of this kind are
fcriuay ai. cuv . _ onlclei because they are so

“U are “in the swing, ’ but others stay away

W a lurking suspicion that you will
there is ai wij ur guinea, because they wa t
not get mu y charity Even private balls
ld ® “falwavs Stt the fancy paints them. There’s
a good of make-believe in society: and, after
accepting a hostess’ hospitality, you can’t very
well tell her it was all a bore, even when it was;
so you politely flb, and say you enjoyed
it very much, when you didn’t. But au an-
nual “house" ball stands on a different foot-
ing; there is no squeezing to get a suiplus
out of it, no inviting people you don’t like be-
cause you dare not offend them; the ball is given
for the one sole object of drawing closer the
sod ii ties of those wh«, it is important, should be
on amiable terms with one another. Employes
cannot go on year after year working together
with advantage unless an esprit dc corps exists
among them, and nothing tends more to it than
such an annual reunion as Farmer’s people have
every winter. They are more elaborate t ban they
used to be, and the affair last Friday was a full
ball, kept up till nearly 4 o’clock, and with brilliant
toilets a-'d good dancers enough to cheerfully nil
the rooms. The only regrettable feature was
that such a small proportion came from \ ictona
House itself. It would almost look as if a
number of the employes did not care about
fixing up an amiable relationship with one
another. However, those who did attend
had so many friends that the ball was a
most successful social affair. Mr. H. H. Brewer
was the hon. sec , and Mr. A. W. Pear- e an agree-
able M.C ; a capital supper was spread, and Mr.
Ernest Needs provided lino music. Extras were
given, besides the twenty-four dances set down
A flame-coloured dress was prominent, the colours
so gay that the lady looked almost like one of the
early Christian martyrs suffering the usual sultry
doom. Rather quieter, but light and pretty as the
wreathing snow, were the white net costumes of
two Balmain bailee, accompanied by a short-
haired attracter from the mid-city, in white with
black stripes. A laughing blonde from Surry
Hills was also all in white, with real maidenhair
and loses placed nearest whore sentiment takes its
rise. A nice little pink was from Balmain; a beau-
tiful dancer from up the river; and a sweet-faced
maid of rather shadowy form from Miller’s Point,
in black broche set with sunflowers. None could
take the palm for fascinating daiclng from a fair
married lady in myrtle green broche; though an
elf in pink jingled a tiny foot with considerable
skill: and a Surry Hills brunette mivht be for-
given for her odd mixture of colours because she
danced so well. From Darlinghurst, a lady came
in really handsume toilet, a creamy yellow s ! 'k,
helped along with some other silky, airy, seduc-
tive fabric, and trimmed with ostrich feathers in
an irresistible way. A married lady wore a very
floe cardinal satin top over skirt of white veiling,
beautifully creweiled in green. A tall brunette
from North Shore in pink skirt and flowered top
was a favourite partner. A handsome married
lady wore a toilet that was deservedly admired; it
was black satin and lace, out decollete, and
trimmed most profusely with yellow flowers in
bouquets and garlands: it was a work of art, and a
picture of taste.

Entirely apart from its bucolio aspect, the
Agricultural Show is a great social event every
year. Last Thursday would have been a lovely
day for new Spring dresses, only the girls did not
know it was coming so warm and sunny, and they
had not got them ready. Perhaps they were just
as glad fterwards; for, in spite of fhelexcellent
efforts of the Society, which nas really done won-
ders in improvement, the grounds were terribly
dusty. This will be obviated in time, and after the
experience of this year's show, the splendid at-
tendance, and the oft-expressed idea of everyone,
there is certain to bo a grand stand erected. The
Governor opened the show.and went round agood
deal: and it was quite late in the afternoon before
the carriage, containing His Excellency and Lieut.
Nathan vis-A-v's to Lady Lottus and Miss Con-
stable, left the ground Each day the band of the
Permanent Artillery played on the lawn, «nd
the parading, trotting, and jumping were all in-
teresting, and sometimes exciting. Several of the
riders were unshipped, and the top rails knocked
out, but no one was hurt, and the ground afforded
grand accommodation for everyone to get a view.
The jumping of a’.lady rider on a splendid grey
was a source of keen excitement, and they were
loudly cheered. Ladies patronised the show very
liberally, and at any moment there wore numbers
of handsome toilets to be seen. On the first day,
two companion costumes were certainly conspicu-
ous from all others. One was a bright chaudron
shade of sur h satin, with trimming of strawberry
and cream foulard, plush hat to match dress, and
parasol to match the foulard. The other was ex-
actly si ilar in style, but the colours were dark
drab and a lighter shade foulard, respectively; and

WALLACE ROSS—(See page 13.)


(SociAr,, continued from page 1C.)
both toilets were line and fashionable. Mrs.
Alderson wore a perfectly neat black cashmere;
and her young *isti-r, Miss H.rdie, a neat brown
velvet and cloth dress, with canary feather
ia the hat. Two navy blue cloth 0 , with hip
drapery, and the alternate pleatings of cardinal,
were a tasteful pair: and a pearl grey beige
in long pleats, with black velvet panier bodice,
was ' also in taste. Mrs W. Cooper wore a
rich mahogany brown moire, beautifully made,
and long mantle, on one day; and afterwards, a
tine black satin de lyon and broche, with a semi-
mantle so flexible and tuickly beaded as to look
like a shimmering coat of black mail with every
movement; beaded bonnet en suite. One of those
charming combinations of colour which show un-
erring taste was seen in Miss Broughton’s toilet,
where a brown cashmere and velvet dress, and
princesa bonnet, were just relieved by a oread
collar of pale blue, with pretty effect. The sister
of one of the jumping competitors wore a costume
and bat of bright red-rust shade, harmonising well
with her fair style. Madame Vogrich’s dress was
a delicious affair; a tine cream veiling with the
new accord o i skirt in very close pleats, dolman of
rich black brocade, and white hat and plume just
tinged with lavender and turned up with crimson
over the handsome, sparkling face. A splen-
did costume was, velvet ruby redlngote and
satin skirt of contrasting crimson, together with
a ruby princess bonnet, under a white satin
parachute elaborately flowered. Many of these
sunshades were remarkable for their gaudy orna-
mentation. A moss-green velvet, with chenille
trimmings and silk pleatings let in, green bonnet
with orange feather, made another lady the sub-
ject of considerable attention; while a black vel-
vet robe, with brocaded gold apron and small
bonnet wreathed with gold, attracted admiration
towards a brunette. Mbs Hill wore a black velvet
and beaded bonnet to match, with a mantle of the
new butterfly velvet brocade, which looked very
rich. Two young ladies illustrated a very popular
style, namely, small and trim bodices of veivet,
with skirts of cashmere to match in hue, pleated
right down, and, ia size, shape, and symmetry,
exactly like a good-sized diving-bell. Whether
this extreme display of artificial rotundity would
accord with popular ideas of feminine beauty
probably did not trouble the wearers. To be iu
the fashion was enough.

There were 350 persons at the School of
Industry ball at heigh House, and though the
room was rather crowded, and the uigbt warm,
the ball was successful, both from a social and a
money point. It is not an ordinary public ball,
though tickets are sold ; probably Lady Lofti s
sold more than anyone else did. Its natrons) meet
for a few hours almost as at a private gathering,
and as all knew one another, few introductionsaru
needed. But anyone going there without friends
would be apt to feel cold. There appeared to be
no master of ceremonies, and consequently the
opening quadrille, formed of two devious lines
down tho room, was decidedly straggling. Lady
Loftus and Government House party arrived
about!) o’clock, and soon all the chairs were filled,
the conservatory populated by pairs, and the
corners of the room crowded with onlookers.
Among the company w<°re Commodore Erskine,
Col. .Richardson, the Mayor and Mayoress of Syd-
ney, several Nelson ollicers, Col. Halkett, Sir
Patrick and Lady Jennings. Messrs. C. Rolleston,
C.M.G.. C. J. Roberts, C.M G., Unwin, R. Bioxsome,
0. Kahlo, &c. Rater on. Judge Windeyer. who had
ijeen chairman at (Herald Massey’s initial lecture,
appeared; and Misses Lee, from the Opera House,
entered abuu< II, and filled their programmes iM a
flash. Thirteen waltzes were given altogether,
aud when the ;ast one struck up as the hall was
clearing, some half-dozen couples only were left
to enjoy that pleasure which finished dancers And
jn one another when they are well matched and
have plenty of room. Miss Jennie Lee was be-
sieged by a party of suitors, but the wily Private
Secretaiy was the favoured one, and the Nelson
warriors were left lamenting. Although the floor
was thickly occupied during the evening, most of
the dancers were good, some exceedingly so, and
only a lew ladieo wore trains, so, with a little
St. ering skill and patience, it was pleasant enough
Sliding round t > the well marked music. Of tue
resses, ballet skirts were seen here and there, but
the great feature was the number of waterfall
backs, which t.re so peculiarly graceful on good
dancers, and such tell-tales of inelegance on bad
ones. As the fair we rors floated round in a
whirl of soft rustling fabrics and dainty colours,
the toilettes which were really most beautiful
were so, in nearly e.ery case, uot so much
for ricuness hk for grace of outline and
Simplicity of style. Two among ihom were
consul u >us neyood all: extra roiusry in colour,
and yet in good taaie—in both cases admirab y
arranged to suit tne physique of the wearer, and
therein lay tneir success. Tne flrs f arrested atten-
tion as the tall and stylish wearer. Miss Constable,
entered on the am of Coi. Maikett. It consisted
of sleeveless satin bodice, cut low, skirtof Horn ced
pet. and gloves to match—all of Havan.-ah brown.
There was no attempt at richness in this unique
toilette; its charm was in tho effect— and in its har-
mony with the warm blonde complexion of the
lady, whose hair, dressed dla Langtry, is of that
Unusually pretty tint known as true autb rn. The
other re’mnrkaole toilette was entirely of the
brightest srrndo of raspberry red, worn by Miss
Kyngdon. The fine broche bodice well fitted a
petite form, and tne skirt of cnenllle-dotted net
was made very bouffant, and fl uinoed -gloves
matched. There was muph charm in the brilliant
costume and its over vivacious wearer. Some were
not so tasteful, indulg ng in a richness of dress,
which, though it cost them more, became them
less. A satin of the now nearly obsolete crusboa
strawberry, and sever, ! cardinals, seemed garish
brought into contact with the elegant white aud
creamy fabrics worn by some of Sydney’s fairest
belles. Mis. Rolleston wore a lovely white net
costume in small flounces, with waterfall back,
and large white pompons dangling from the
basque bodice. One young lady wore a most pecu-
liar dress; }t was white satin, and the skirt was
on- m iss of snja}i;frills from waist to hem—there
must have been thirty or fopty of them ; other-
wise, the dress was plain, aud had an innocent
look. Miss Moore wore a broche of gamboge tint,
euged with ticelle lace, which gave the dress a
subdued appearance, A cognate colour was
chosen by Mrs. Moriarty, only it was brilliant and
lovely. It was amber op buttercup broche of the
richest sheen, with semi-sleeves of iace, and the
small sunflowers in her dark hair were in admir-
able keeping. Mrs. Want wore a handsome black
dress, and the Misses Roberts, one a cream cos-
tume, and the other a pretty white decked with
buttercup flowers. Almost all the jeuiiesie, or
dancing portion of the company, it may be noted,
wore low dresses and sleeveless, while the mater-
nal contingent wore da ker dresses and more
of them. Miss Jennie Lee wore black satin,
with immense bust bouquet of orange-coloured
roses, and deep cream gloves reach! g nearly
to the shoulder. Miss Ada Lee also made
choice of black costume, a broche satin beaded,
and lone- suede gloves. Lady Jennings displayed a
charming cream broche dress trimmed with lace,
and richly bordered with gim;« embroidery. Two
bright-faced sisters, well-known Potts’ Point way,
wore gracefully dieased; one In white silk, the
younger in a fairylike toilet of finest white tullo,
decked with golden roses. “ Stepping a measure ”
with the Commodore, a tall, dark lady displayed a
magnificent buttercup broche with train, andjthe
Skirt castellated at tho bottom with small tabs, a
spray of autumn-tinted leaves on the breast: an
extremely elegant toilette. Miss Brennan’s dress
was ottoman cord of coral pink, the lower part
only being draped with delicate flowered lace,
rrom the rich black duchesse satin ot Mrs. W.
Cooper gleamed what Wilkie Collins has called “a
bright emphasis of diamonds,” this scintillating
suite of gems .ncludiug a butterfly on the breast, a
necklace and pendant cross, and stars in the hair.
Ine Misses Hill were in white satin, and in blue
satin aud tulle, respectively. Miss Windeyei’s was
a really delicious costume of corded silk, a delicate
pink colour, fresh aud crisp-looking, and edged
with ruching of frayed satin to match, and alro-
?etner a dainty creation. Miss Benjamin wore
light blue broche and white lace, bodice trimmed
with ostrich feathers; and Mrs. Moodle, a black
relieved with white plumes on the ghoul-
«eps awfl corsag-, with capital effect, Mis. J.lm
Hardie, the Mayoress, wore an exceedingly fine

A*® bridegroom, Mr. Frederic John Nicholas, is
the eldest son of Mr. Samuel Ridley, lormerly of
Urisbane, and a second cousin of the bride. Family
guests to the number of twenty sat down to a
sumptuous dejeuner, and after the usual toasts
wore proposed and responded to, the happy couple
drove off amidst Showers of rice and old s foes. In
the evening, the company was augmented by a
large circle ot friends, who kept up the dance till
an early hour. The presents to the bride were
both numerous and costly.
There were two fine balls at Corov.M in the show
time, when visitors came from all parts by rail
and road Mrs. Coyle whs the belle of both the
looked charming. Miss LUlie
Kotton (from Sydney), and her cousin Miss Lillie
Smith (from Melbourne), were both great acquisi-
tions to the room. Miss Gill looked angelic in pure
white. Miss Edo Is was dr. seed in all the colours of
theralnbow. But the chief colours of dress were
cream and white. The dancing of Mrs. Bahm and
h»r brother was very much admired ; while a
?J^ ar young squatter was so enraptured with
the abilities and charms of a Melbourne lady that
the popular; conundrum since, has been did he
dance thirteen times with her, or whs oniy one
dance lasting four hours ? At any rate, the' bUio

ot the best dancers of the ball.

was there tor extra tickets, that people were offer

Adelaide Noilson was peerlessly, radiantly, di-
vinely beautiful. There was grace ineffable in the
long sweep of her linos; richness of colour in the
warm, pale olive of her skin; the blaze of all the
passions in the dark of her gipsy eyes, set off by
the feathery frame of her curling red-brown hair.
There was a wealth of expression in the curves of
her full red lips, and merriment in the flash of her
white, white teeth. Her voice was sweet, and
passion-freighted. No one who ever saw this
matchless creature fairly shining with beauty,
will forget the picture. Yet both these women
were of common clay. The one is said to have
risen from the slums of London; the other from
the fens of Northumberland.” And the Lily?

looking stick.”
The Mayor of Coventry has made a pre-
sentation of a beautifully illuminated address to
Miss Maude Forrester, the beautiful actress, who
personated the character of Lady Godiva in the
pageant last year. As the costume of the charac-
Miss Dawes, of London University, is the
llrst lady M.A. in England.
They were sitting on the sofa in their
drawing-room, conversing in a low, tremulous
tone. They had only been married a short time.
He seized her hand and said, with a voice full of
emotion, “ Birdie, do you know that it was your
innate modesty, your apparent Indifl'erence, that
ma le me resolve to win you at all hazards ? * Yes,
George, the apparent-indifference game Is what
captured you. You are the first one I tried it on.
1 lost three or four eligible young men by gushing
over them too much, before it occurred to me to
change my tactics. I wish it had occurred to me
sooner;” and she sighed heavily.
Miss Muller, one of the leading English
advocates of Woman-Suffrage, who is a member
of the London School Board, refuses to pay taxes
on the ground that, havings no vote, she is not
morally bound to contribute to the revenue. So
her goods were the other day levied upon by the
bailiff, and, after the ceremony had been gone
through, a feminine indignation meeting was, with
true feminine incapacity for humour, hold in Miss
Muller’s temporarily dismantled rooms. It was
addressed by Miss Babb, Miss Briggs, and Miss
Todd. Miss Babb gave a magnificent specimen of
inconsequence. She stated that she had allowed
her things to be seized in 1871, and had continued
the process ever since, except for ono year. Her
heroic conduct is unknown to fame and without
effect upon legislation, yet she anticipates that the
seizure of Miss Muller’s “things” will be the
beginning of a great movement throughout Eng-
land. Another lady had followed her examole,
but after a time she married-which painful back-
sliding would naturally put a stop to hostile opera-
tions against the Government. Miss Todd thought
that the question could not be presented in too
great a variety of ways, and that this of having
one’s escritoire seized is a very effectual mode.
Woman’s emotions have much to answer
for. Women are just as honest as men, and a deal
more amiable, as far as Intentions go, hut yet the
fact remains that owing to some peculiarity in
their nervous systems, women are—not to put too
fine a point upon it-untameable romancers. The
absolute incapacity of the sex for repeating a
story j ist as it reached them is a matter of every-
day observation. A woman will unquestionably
exaggerate the merest nothing which has scared
her ; not from any wilful desire to pervert, but
because her Imagination is stronger than eirher
her morals or her intellect. All women are not
liars, but there is a something constitutionally in-
herent in them that prevents them making exact
statements of tact; nor does the sad-eyed youth
require to be told that, in her protestations of feel-
ing, a woman can be as false as an epitaph. In-
surance offices have been known to decline taking
them as risks, from the impossibility of getting at
the exact truth regarding the insuree’s age, state
of health, mode of life, &c. For similar reasons,
some financiers have refused to lend the false sex
money. Lawyers know perfectly well that a
woman will break her oath as easily as a biscuit—
simply because she la too emotional to be exact,
and her statements are Inevitably governed by her
imagination. Only very young people are inno-
cent enough to faithfully accept what a woman
tells them, without making considerable deduc-
tions for “ windage.”
Ne romance is stranger than this brief
nage of history. When toe Tweed ring ruled
supreme in New York, the youngest daughter of
Boss Tweed had a superb marriage, her bridal
gifts alone totting to over £35,000. The costliest
present of all was given by Thomas Fields, a king
of the ring whose wife that night in her dazzling
beauty and queenly mien eclipsed every woman
in the magnificent and diamond-decked assembly.
That is scene the first. The Tweed ring broke;
Fields, no longer a financial king, fled from the
law into the wilds of Canada, and with him a
notorious courtesan. His deserted wife took to
drink. The dresses and Jewels she had secreted
found their way into pawn; and in two years, the
magnificent queen of the Fields mansion became a
common drunkard and a street tramp. One
winter’s night, when sleet and hail drove citizens
to their homes, a vagrant in a thin calico dress was
seen oy a policeman to drop down in the freezing
slush of the street. Next day, scene two closed
with the burial of Mrs. Thomas Fields in a pauper s
grave When Fields deserted his wife, he had
placed their daughter, then eight years old. in a
convent. But the money for her education ceased
to come, and she had to leave. Unable to obtain
employment in New York, her few dollars melted
awav. and she was turned out of lodgings in the
city to starve. Standing faint and shivering in the
very street where her mother had fallen, the girl,
born in a palaoo and reared in luxury, took her
haggard beauty to the police station and begged
to be taken in, to save her virtue and her life. The
entry in the police-sheet told the closing scene of
this romance of New York.
Of the numberless vagaries of fashion, the
last is the most daring of all. What think you of
a woman displaying in everyday life, and in broad
daylight, those particular charms which have
hitherto been seen only above the satin bodice, in
the warm, mellowed light of the glittering ball-
room? Yet this is the culmination that female
vanity h&s roaciiGd. Of oours©* th© fashion will
never be universal, for few women have the
splendid marble skin, the faultless bust and arms,
that would be necessary for good effect in the
glare of daylight. But those who are favoured in
this respect hail with joy a change where the aegis
of fashion (under whose protection society can do
nothing immoral) is thrown over a habit whose
voluptuous indecency would, in any other circum-
stances. be almost Illegally bold The last innova-
tion in dress, or rather undress, consists of a bodice
exactly resembling in shape the usually unseen
corset, only instead of being worn inside the dress.
It is the dress itself, leaving shoulders, arms, and
chest quite bare. In the street, a small mantle is
worn, and long gloves on the arms come up to
meet it at the elbow, but on entering a house the
mantle Is discarded, and then its wearer enjoys her
triumph. The mantle is made of sealskin, or some
exceedingly heavy fabric—for, if it were not
ostensibly very warm, there would be no excuse
for throwing it off. For matinees morning visits,
and similar occasions, the corset-cunwnantle ar-
rangement is already in great vogue, and the
ladies with the most sculptured figures are the
delight of the men, and the envy and despair of
their less favoured sisters, who are distanced
under such severe conditions in the race of beauty.
An observant lady says:—“The women of
New York are not beautllul. Their pale, sallow
complexion and too slight figures forbid the idea.
But they are redeemed by their matchless style.
It is astonishing how rare absolute beauty is. I
saw flocks of pretty girls-pretty with the henutS
du Diable— but not one beautiful woman, that is.
of beauty peerless and unquestioned, like Adelaide
Neilson or Alice Dunning.” Now. we have met
several people who have spoken of Alice Dunning
Lingarrt as their nearest ideal of womanly physi-
cal perfection. And. as “Betsy B.,” of the
ARGONAUT, has just been comparing these two
women with Mrs. Langtry, we will quote her too;
—“ We have regarded Alice Lingard and Adelaide
Neilson as the two peerless beauties of the stage.
Alice is a woman of superb physique, with a cast
of countenance not intellectual, and yet far be-
yond the reproach of mere prettiness; a magnifl-
ter Is described as havlM oQMisted of a be-
oornlnflT snill© and a timid it would nav©
been more appropriate to present Miss Forrester
with a dress than an address.

Two Staffordshire potters have been hauled
up for “ burlesquing the Salvation Array. De-
fendants had followed “ General "Booth s proces-
sion with a donkey, dressed in a black cloak and a
Salvation bonnet. On one side of the cloak was
labelled “ Salvation Jennie, and on the other side
“ Hallelujah Ass." They also dressed up a bull-
dog with a Salvation bonnet and jersey, the latter
bearing the motto of the Army, Blood and Fire.
Had we defended this case, we should have urged
that the offence amounted to one merely of Imita-
tion, not of burlesque.
At a London Police Court, the other day, a
prisoner, on being 1 asked if he had any witnesses to
call, said, “Only God Almighty I” This wasn t aa
original remark, for many years ago a lunatic, who
declared in Court that he was sane, when asked
whether he had any friend who would go surety
for him, said he had only one friend in the world.
The magistrate asked his address. The prisoner:
“ He is Divine Providence, and his address is any-
where or everywhere.” The magistrate was slightly
taken aback, but, wishing to conciliate the patient,
remarked, “Yes; but, you see, for the purpose of
bail we must have some more settled residence.
Mr. John Hayes, of Boon, Ireland, didn’t
exactly fall In love; but a little while ago it oc-
curred to him that It would be a good thing to
marry the daughter of the Widow Ryan, of Temple-
derry, for to that young lady was attached a mar-
riage portion of £350. So he went to the widow’s
house on the evening of 7th March, and an agree-
ment was entered into that he should marry Miss
Ryan on the following Sunday. In the interim,
John obtained from the widow a loan of £50 to
cover the marriage expenses; but when the guests
were assembled tor the wedding breakfast, and
the expected bridegroom arrived, he quarrelled
about the money, broke off the match, and left
suddenly. There were the bride-expectant, the
Iirlest, and the wedding breakfast, but these ad-
unots to matrimony were all useless without the
"broth of a bhoy” who had been expected to
“hitch up.” However, the deep sympathy and
high indignation felt by the wedding guests did
not deprive those practical people of their appe-
tites, for they sat down to eat what should have
been a wedding breakfast, and consumed, ameng
other things, sixteen gallons of whisky in their
endeavours to dissipate the gloom which hung like
a pall over this most melancholy meal. Miss
Ryan's mother demanded from John (who had
meanwhile married another girl with more money)
a refund of the borrowed £50. It was too absurd
to pay a man £50 for jilting ner'daughter; but
with almost incredible meanness Mr. Hayes would
only return £19, a leging thstth.,- balance of £31
had bee i spent In entertaining his would-be
brother-in-law and her friends. The widow took
an action and recovered tne £31 swallowed when
toe marriage-feast of her daughter had been
turned into a " wake ” held over that young lady s
dead hopes. These proceedings, though perhaps
almost unique, iccall an enteriainment held some
years ago In Melbourne. A man who had frac-
tured ms s ull was admitted to the Alfre, hospi-
tal, where he lay tor days, unconscl us. The
injuries ter© so extensive that the doctors co
s deren he had no earthly chance of recovery—and
so sure was the house-surgeon about the matter,
that he, before leaving the hospital one day, wrote
out a certificate of death, and left it with the hos-
pital clerk in case the paiient should die during n a
a senec. Wh u the patient entered the institution
he had on his per«< n £30 odd, of which the frenda
who brought him took possession; but these goou
people were so full of sorrow that hey could not
refrain from trying to drown it in a sort of antici-
patory wake, during the course of which all the
money wi-s expended. The writer was in the
County Court when the mm with the broaen skull,
who. aftc’- all, had completely recovered, obtained
a verdict for the £30 against hi relatives, who
could only plead that "tuey thought he was da id,
and know he had left them the money in his will.”
abashed, he humbly apologised to the worthy man
for absconding with his barmaid. “Oh, it don’t
matter,”said the man, laughing; “ she’s my neice,
and when we knowed you was a-comin’ we had
her sent up on purpose. We ain’t lost nothin’by
It, bless you I She sent all the money homo. I’m
come to take her back to-day. I bear no malice.
Good mornin’ 1” And he sniggered softly away.
At the recent Temperance Celebration
hold in West Maitland, Parson Stead injured a
good story in the telling of it in a most heart-
less way. He said “ he did not intend to make
the same mistake as Charles Lamb, who, button-
holing his friend, Coleridge, to read some poetry
to him, became so tedious that Coleridge cut off
the button and left Lamb (who had a habit of
closing his eyes) to speak to the air.” And then
the M Mail's Ignoramus of a reporter quite unne-
cessarily adds that there was “ daughter.” Great
heavens, we should say sol Who could have re-
frained from laughter that witnessed the holy
man making such a fool of himself ? It was Cole-
ridge who button-holed Lamb beneath a portico
wher? both had taken shelter one wet morning. It
was Lamb who cut off the button; and it was
Lamb who, returning home past the portico in the
afternoon, found Coleridge still there with the
button still in his hand, preaching away more sno
anent the Infinities. Ordinarily, we don t believe
in the lash as a punishment, yet were a jest-
manglor occasionally triced up to the triangles, no
word of ours would go against the proceeding.
Here is something neat in obituary
notices from a Goulbourn Valley (Vic.) paper:—
“ M’Leav. —On theSIst July, 1884, in Mooroppna,
Victoria, Roderick, son of the late Donald M Leay,
head gamekeeper to the Earl of Cromarty, brother
of Hay M’Leay, head gamekeeper to the Duke of
Sutherland, Scotland, aged 49 years. Home papers
please cony.” No high-falutln style about this, you
see, but Just making the best use of the materials
on hand. The M’Leay family, though a very
ancient and honourable on©, could not claini
relationship with “docks” and 44 mar kisses, and
such, so they utilised their connection with titled
“pussons” with good effect. Son to the head
gamekeeper of the Earl of Cromarty, and brother
to the head gamekeeper of the Duke of Suther-
land!” What more glory can anyone wish for
than that 1 What safer passport could any man
hand over to St. Peter for inspection ? In our own
case we see a rift in the cloud that opens up a
bright future for us. We were filled with gloom
at the thought of having to fee one of Alfred s
mortuary poets to heave out a chunk of funereal
rhyme when we turned up our toes, but, having
the example of the M’Leay family before us, and
knowing that our paternal parent was head bottle-
washer to a C.M.G., and also that a distant relative
was foreman bootblacker to a libel court Judge,
we can now afford to say, O, Death, whereisthy
sting ? O, Grave, where is thy victory ? Home
papers please copy.
“ What’s in aname?” Why, there’s a great
deal in a name, and all the logic in the world can. t
alter it. This is one of the reasons why such high-
toned appellations are bestowed upon the heroes
and heroines of those woiks of
fiction known as “penny dreadfuls. Can wei sup-
pose that anyone would read about Sally Brown
or Tom Jenkins ? but won’t they weep their eyes
out over the love-sick Florence Emetine Mal-
travers, and devour the adventures of the tall,
ethereal youth, who calls himself Edwin Horatio
Fitzmaurice? And, again, there are names that
cling to us with the tenacity of the proverbial
leech, while others drop from our memories like
water off a duck’s back. We are beusiitedbyone
and the other, and our hearts and minds being
ever open to such impressions, the name of om
benefactor becomes a “ household word. And it
is because great and lasting benefits have resulted
from the spirit and enterprise of Anthony Hordern
and Sons, of the Palace Emporium, Haymarket,
thattheirname has become so deservedly popular.
Stellmaclier, an Austrian dynamitard,
under sentence of death, tried to get bombs smug-
gled into his cell. It was his Intention to apply for
a fresh trial, at which he would reveal important
facts concerning the organisation or the anarchist
conspiracy as well as tne manufacture of explo-
sives; but he would stipulate that, at this trial,
besides the examining judge, the President of the
Tribunal, the Director of Police, and the Ambas
sador of Germany should be present as witnesses,
as he would only make his revelations in the pre-
sence of these persons. Then as soon as all should

The English doctors are at hopeless vari-
ance as to the treatment of cholera. One school
swears by opium In large doses, another recom-
mends small doses, and only carried to a certain
point, while a third protests against narcotics in
any form. There is a precisely similar difference
in regard to stimulants. As to other drugs, it
seems as if every doctor of eminence had his own
treatment. Again, some advise ice-water and
solid ice ad Ubitum~ others are equally strong
against it. Onegentleman injects fourteen ounces
of milk into a vein; another says “a copious imbi-
bition of cold water will suffice for the cure of
must curable diseasee.” One French doctor ap-
pears to have cured many cases right off by mak-
ing the patients inhale oxygen.
“How has Adolphus been to-day, deah? ”
asked one of the bloodiest-blooded aristocrats of
Darling Point, as he leaned back in his elegantly-
carved dining-room chair, and cleaned his nails
with the fish-knife. “Bettah, Chawles,” replied
his queenly spouse, as she squashed a fly on her
arm with a napkin; “ but, do you know, deah, that
common fellah, Dr. Blunt, had the impertinence
to say Adolphus had the mumps, just the same as
if he was the child of one of those horrid working-
people, sa I ordered him out at once and sent for
Dr. Theodore Toph, and he at once declared that
the pooah child was suffering from acute inflam-
mation of the salivary glands. Mumpsl The very
ideah makes me smile. As if a child of Pauliue de

A few years ago—it doesn't matter how
many—a Victorian Judge, who had acquired a cer-
tain amount of notoriety on account of his parsi-
mony, rather than his brilliancy on the judicial
Bench, was on circuit in the Bendigo district
(Vic ), when he put up at a leading hotel, the ren-
dezvous of the commercial travellers in »ana-
hurst. Instead, however, of securing private
apartments for his special accommodation, as naa
been customary with his predecessors in the same
lino of business, he elected to take the chances ol
the table d'hote, and did so accordingly. It need
hardly be said that the presence of suon a solemn
functionary seated at the same table with accom-
pany of these rollicking “ bag-men, had rattier a
depressing effect a id dinner, under the circum-
stances, developed Into a very slow affair. His
Honor proved a very wet blanket, indeed, and
though several vigorous efforts had been made to
give a moderately lively, if not absolutely gay,
tone to the proceedings, yet they only ended in so
mauy condemned failures. Even the irrepressible
Joe Norris, whose spicy anecdotes were wont to
make the banquet-room ring again with merry
peals of laughter, found himself gradually but
surely wilting under the funereal influence of the
Judge; the mirthful Mahaffy s best jokes fall flat
as a prosy parson’s “seventeenthly; the rat h st
stories of the inventive Holtz failed to raise even
the ghost of a .'mile; the liveliest ,ieu d esprit of
t he brilliant Bresnau seemed only to make things
more gloomy; and the vivacity of the playful
Props! iny got tinged with a sadness that might
be felt. A dismal state of affairs truly, and ore
like! v’ to last for several days, as there was a lengthy
law list to he disposed of. and the Judge appeared
to like his quarters. What was to ho done ? The
landlord was appealed to, but ho could not suggest
any remedy, and the “ boys,” having all the starch
i alien out of than), felt about as gay as the average
man when honoured with an extended visit from
his mother-in-law. Things were at their worst,
when Edward Gleeson arrived from Melbourne, and
he, having noticed the prevailing despondency, in
iiis usual cheery voice inquired, “ What the devil
is the matter here? Bedad, you look gay enough
to become suddenly wealthy by T hiring out as
funeral mutes.” Ned, as the “ boys called him
for shortness, represented a wholesale wlnsky-
sslliug tlrm in the metropolis, and, to use the ver-
nacular of the South of France, “ he was as dacent
a boy as ever tossed off a rummer ov punch on a
frosty mornin’.” His soft accents were particularly
suggestive of the sighing of the zephyrs that waft
across the Bogof Allen [Neat simile, thatl—KD. B.J,
and his superior judgment in the matter ot good
whisky, together with his genial disposition, made
him a general favourite on the Victorian nigh
ways. And when It came to spinning a humorous
anecdote having a flavour of the brogue about It,
then Edward annexed the greater part of the
damper, so to speak. So, in answertoNed squery,
the “ boys ” let up on the situation, and explained
the cause of the trouble that was gradually break-
iog them all up. * 4 He must bo the divil intirely if
I don’t give him a bit of a start this evening,” was
the re assuring reply; ‘‘and unless he's as thick-
skinned as rhinoceros, we'll get rid of him.” That
evening, the Judge was in his accustomed seat ere
tae expiring echo of the dinner-gong had died
away in the dim recesses of the spacious cor-
ridors of Shamrock [Shades of Miss UraddonI—
Ed. B J, and the “ commercials ” and other tourists
wore aiso lothe fore, ready to make war to the
knife on “the good things provided ” (we quote
the Hum), Just then Gleeson entered the dining-
room, sauntered carelessly to where His Honor
was seated, and, giving him a hearty slap on the
shoulder, sang out quite cheerily, “Hello, ould
‘Canterbury cake’! How the divil are you?”
“Pardon me, sir,” replied the astonished Judge,
“ but I think you have made a mistake.” “ Not I,
faith,” rejoined the imperturbable Ned; “I never
forget ould friends. Don’t you remember the
spree wo had at Castlemaine that last trip, when
you were travelling for Quest with the Canter-
bury cakes and lollies ? Ah, you’re a sly old dog!
How about the girl on the stairs?” “Sir,” said
the now irate Judge, as his otherwise placid coun-
tenance gradually assumed the colour of a boiled
beet, “ you’re entirely mistaken. I’m Judge Skin-
flint. I don't know you; I never travelled for
Guest; and furthermore, sk, I know nothing
about Canterbury cakes or Tollies.” “OhI alsy
now; aisy, my boy," said the cheerful Ned, whilst
a ripple of suppressed mirth ran round the table;
“to he sure, it wasn’t much to travel with; but
that doesn’t matter, we never go back on a man
because he’s only doing business in a small way,
and, though the Canterbury cake was only a light
line, yet we recognise you as one of ourselves—
one ot the noble army of bagmen of Victoria.
Judge Skinflint. Indeed! Fact is, I suppose, you’ve
got a bit of a lift lately, and you don’t want to re-
cognise an old fellow-traveller now that you’re in
luck’s way.” This last sally was too much for His
Honor, and as the merriment that followed was
sufficient to equanimity of Solomon, had
he been round, the Judge left the room, mutter-
ing inverted blessings on the travelling fraternity
in general, and especially the audacious one who
claimed him as one of the brotherhood, and even
then as only a iow purveyor of Canterbury cakes.
We’ll draw a veil over the carnival that ensued,
and won’t even tell you with what enthusiasm the
health of the redoubtable Ned was received. There
are some subjects that are even too sacred for our
pern

AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral.
No other complaints are so insidious in their
attack as those affecting the throat and lungs:
none so trifled with by the majority of suffer-
ers. The ordinary cough or cold, resulting
perhaps from a trifling or unconscious ex-
posure, is often but the beginning of a fatal
sickness. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral has
well proven its efficacy in a forty years’ fight
with throat and lung diseases, and should bo
taken in all cases without delay.
A Terrible Cough Cured.
“ In 18571 took a severe cold, which affected
my lungs, I had a terrible cough, and passed
night after night without sleep. The doctors
gave me up. I tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral, which relieved my lungs, induced
sleep, and afforded me the rest necessary
for the recovery of my strength. By the
continued use of the Pectoral a perma-
nent cure was effected. I am now 62 years
old, hale and hearty, and am satisfied your
Cherry Pectoral saved me.
Horace Fairbrothee.”
Rockingham, Vt., July 15, 1882.
* Croup. — A Mother’s Tribute.
“While in the country last winter my little
boy, three years old, was taken ill with croup;
ft seemed as if he would die from strangu-
lation. One of the family suggested the use
of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, a bottle of
which was always kept in the house. This
was tried in small and frequent doses, and
to our delight in less than half an hour the
little patient was breathing easily. The doc-
tor said that the Cherry Pectoral had
saved my darling’s life. Can you wonder at
our gratitude ? Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Emma Gedney.”
153 West 128th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
“ I have used Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
in my family for several years, and do not
hesitate to pronounce it the most effectual
remedy for coughs and colds w r e have ever
tried. A. J. Crane.”
Lake Crystal, Minn., March 13,1882.
“ I suffered for eight years from Bronchitis,
and after trying many remedies with no suc-
cess, I was cured by the use of Ayer’s Cher-
ry Pectoral. Joseph Walden.”
Byhalia, Miss., April 5,1882.
“ I cannot say enough in praise of Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral, believing as I do that
but for its use I should long since have died
from lung troubles. E. Bragdon.”
Palestine, Texas, April 22,1882.
No case of an affection of the throat or
lungs exists which cannot be greatly relieved
by the use of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral,
and it will always cure when the disease is
not already beyond the control of medicine.

The aotion on part of the police In charg-
ing the little Makm girl with being a common
prostitute, has its serious as well as its ludicrous
side. The serious side is the extraordinary con-
fliotion of evidence in the case; variations of the
oath, which, had we not had of late such em-
phatic evidence of the truth of the police when in
the witness-box, would probably have caused us
to view the decision of Mr. "’Malley Clarke with
Borne trifling feelings of surprise. As it is, we
have to congratulate the magistrate upon his de-
cision. In his superior wisdom, he is probably
aware that College-street is by no means the re-
cognised walk of professional women, who parade
the same side of the same thoroughfare “ plying
for hire,” night after night, for years, and are
never interfered with. Mr. Clarke is quite cer-
tain, samdoute, that the condition of a certain part
of Blizabeth-street is “healthy;” that wretched
girls, half-drunk with liquor there, do not haunt
the “pubs.” until they are closed, and then hold
high revel in the streets all night. It is a secret to
Mr. O’Malley Clarke, doubtless, that two-thirds of
the most drunken, brazen, and thieving women on
the town are allowed to go free, because the police
have “conscientious” reasons for not arresting
them. His Worship, in his superior knowledge,
must know that Crown-street is a thoroughfare of
virgin purity. That, by day and night, a portion
of the street in question, is not the scene of one
shrieking orgle, that the women do not parade,
and curse, and flaunt in the street, and enact in
the public-houses scenes of unblushing revelry,
which have even less of the grotesque about them
than the hideous I Of course, this settles it! The
Hllder girl was, doubtless, according to the “evi-
dence,” a desperate, type of immorality!.'! How-
ever. she shouldn’t be made an exception of. As
the Rum proposes that all the Oppositionists should
be suspended in the same ma ner as Mr. Taylor,
we propose that Mr. Clarke direct the police to
arrest all disorderly women, whose profession is
to be “ gay/’ but who are not. But, on considera-
tion, no! For, if this were carried out, what
would the plato-humpers have to do after church
on Sunday ?
Fora “bit of ralo divarshun” commend
us to an Irish Parliamentary election, especially
one in the sunny South among the “ bould boys 1 ’
of Waterford and Tipperary. Not one of your
modern elections, though, with ballot boxes, and
scrutineers, and things, but one of the “ould
shtylo,” when open voting was the rule, when
every elector went to the poll armed with a baul-
thaun of blackthorn—a weapon that never missed
Are; the good old days when the “ botboen boys ”
used to form a prominent feature in the neigh-
bourhood of the polling booth, and cracked heads
amongst the voters used to be as plentiful as
blackberries in a hedge. After the defeat of Mr.
Bernal Osborne, at Nottingham, in the general
election of 1868, ho determined to woo an Irish
constituency, and, in duo course, came forward as
a candidate for the city of Waterford in opposition
to Mr. Smyth, who was then an ardent repealer,
but who has considerably altered his views since.
Osborne was by no means the popular candidate,
but money and influence—[Things unknown in our
sunny clime. Ep. B.]-did what popularity would
fall to secure in most cases. The populace refused
to hear him on the hustings, and on the day of
nomination there were “ terrible ructions,” human
gore flowing freely. Hired gangs of roughs, or
r ‘both* en boys," were posted at the entrances of
the hall in which Osborne delivered his election
speeches, and scattered amongst the audience
were several contingents whose business was to
keep the mob quiet by means of brute force.
Lively as things were on the day of nomination,
the excitement on the day of election completely
eclipsed them; and, when the populace learnt that
Osborne had been elected by a majority of eight,
their suppressed vongeance burst out in all its
fury, and a scene of wreck, riot, and disorder
ensued that beggats ail description. Thetupporters
of the successful candidate narrowly escaped
with their lives, and usborne himself beat a juni-
oious and masterly retreat from the hustings by
being smuggled through a back window into a
draper’s shop, where be passed the night carefully
stowed away in a pile of blankets. Next morning
he departed unostentatiously for the shores of
“ Merrie England,” and in the tranquillity of his
home at Nowtown-Anner he spent several weeks
in recovering from “ the success of an Irish elec-
tion.” The following items from the bill which
was presented for payment to the agent of the vic-
torious candidate, give a fair idea of how the con-
test was won :—
“Paid men to protect gate from mob on
the several nights of the meeting.. £17 6 0
Paid further expenses for ditto 6 5 0
Paid mob armed from time to time 10 0
Paid eighty men on the nomination
day to procure Mr. Osborne a hear-
ing 38 0 0
Cash paid Carty 100
Paid Maloney, who broke his leg by a
fall from Mr. Osborne’s platform.. 3 0 0.”
Concurrent with the Waterford election, the “ boys
of gallant Tipperary ” were engaged in an equally
exciting contest, the candidates being O’Donovan
Bossa, who was at the time a political convict in
Milbank prison ; Charles Kickham, a co-Na-
tionalist; and D. C. Heron, Q.C. The result was
the election of O’Donovan Bossa by a big majority,
when a scene of tumult followed, that can best be
imagined utter perusing the appended account,
which was sent in to one of Mr. Heron’s election
agents, by a “ broth of a Tipperary boy,” for pay-
ment:—

That the charges were moderate for “the work
done,” no person can doubt for a moment. And
now we just yearn to got a glance at some of the
bills that were footed up at the last election for
East Sydney.
Solomon, or David, or some other of those
giddy old Israelites who lived several years ago to
a ripe old age, remarked, with a good deal of truth,
that a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband.
And those old fossils were good authorities when
it came to judging the qualities of the sex. They
had such varied opportunities, you know. But we
reckon that we can go many shekels better than
either of the Jewish notabilities referred to, and
confidently rake in the stamps. For we have dis-
covered a woman who la not only a crown to her
lawfully-wedded lord, but a dozen of them per
woek. with board, lodging, and washing thrown in.
'Ibis paragon, we don’t mind telling you, lives in
had a right good time, and fun was uncontrolled
until, in an unguarded moment, the “ strong and
influential committee” who bossed the show shifted
the athletes’ winning-post from its original posi-
tion In front of the whisky saloon to some distance
away. This proceeding not only visibly affected the
consumption of liquor, but excited the ire of the
landlady, who immediately ordered her other half
to hurry up with a liquor-stand to the newgeal
where the pleasure-seekers assembled. A mild
kind of civil war was the result, for the committee
resented this new departure, and handed over the
energetic grog-dispenser to the tender care of the
bould gendarmes, who lodged him deep in a
dungeon cell, with the encouraging remark, “ Be-
gorra, I think I’ll be able to tlnd you there in the
mornin’.” Then Lawyer Barrett gave Lawyer
Turner a sly dig in the ribs, and facetiously re-
marked, “ Behold, there are sundry shekels for us
in this thing;” and the forecast proved correct.
James Bauld—we forgot to mention his name be-
fore—was promptly acquitted on the charge of
trespass by the local beaks, so he immediately in-
stituted a County Court action against a septette
of the tyrannical committee for false imprison-
ment, assessing his damages at somewhere about
£2,000,000—a sum, we need scarcely add, that would
seriously inconvenience > he business prospects of
even these bloated capitalists of Numurkab, bad
the prosaic little Itownship of Numurkah (Vic.)—
the future Chicago of that section of the Cabbage
Garden—(we never saw a one-horse village that
hadn’t'a great future bafore it)—where she runs a
snug little hotel on her own hook; and her
“ hubby ” occupies the position of No. S in the
household, for which he is paid at the rate of £3
per week, with the privileges already enumerated
thrown in. Well, this enterprising landlady was
the highest bidder for the right to supply whisky
and other temperance cordials to the rustics of that
wheat-growing region who assembled on Easter
Monday last in a oow-paddook adjacent to the
township, where they held high carnival. They
the case gone against them. When Mr. Bauld
faced the music in front of Judge Cope and an
intelligent jury of four a week or two ago, in
Melbourne, his evidence jogged along somewnat in
this style:—“ I am an uncertiflcated insolvent, and
work for my wife- I have done so for the past
twelve months. I get £3 per week, have no
stated hours of labour, and keep a banking
account.” That’s his version of It. Now, what
do you think of that for a model wife? After
that, Ann Theresa Bauld becomes the plaything of
the lawyers for a spell, and she starts off her yarn
thusly “ I am licensee of the Eoyal Mail Hotel,
Numurkah, and purchased the booth in question.
I authorised my servant, James Bauld, to apply
for a temporary license for the sports and act. for
me at the same, and I ordered him to take the
tables, liquor, etc., near the winning-post after the
sports commenced.” And then, in cross-examina-
tion by Mr. Hood, she said: “If Bauld had not done
as I ordered him, I would not sack him, but would
get another of my servants to carry out my In-
structions.” “James is No. 1 servant, is he?”
queried the barrister, to which the lady replied
with becoming dignity, “ No, I am No. I: he is No
3.” There’s a woman for you, who holding supreme
power in her own circle yet does not abuse her
authority by holding the reins too tight. Happily
her other half carries out her instructions to the
letter, even at the peril of his cherished liberty;
but should he at any time feel constrained to kick
over the traces and refuse duty, he would not be
compelled to join the unemployed except as an
honorary member. Some men have all the luck of
it, sure enough. Now, when we took to our bosom
a meek-looking and blushing bride, we had an idea
that this little earth of ours was transformed into
an amateur paradise, but ere a tew short moons

Thus the N.Y. Tribune, re the acting in
certain part of Miss Catherine Hill:—‘‘The lad
was a pupil of Mr. Buckstone. She has all the (in'
swanlike air, the musical volubility, and the taleni
of incessant, instantaneous transition, which ar
among the attributes so essential to high corned
acting.” The N.Y. World says:—“She managec
to convey to the part a buzzing bluebottle empt
ness that was peculiar, and flitted through th
scenes like one of those emphemera that are killec
by the sunshine that hatches them.”
“ Be just, and fear not; let all thou aim’s
at be thy country’s, thy God’s, and truth’s.” That’
the high-toned motto of the Numdrkah Pettit
and Wunqhnu Wail, a new literary venture pub
lished in the interests of the proprietor in the
Goulburn Valley (Vic.); and right underneath thi
lofty moral procept, the “eulchawed,” and we
might say gltted, editor bubbles over inaperfec
stream of sorrow because a local society didn’ni
ante-up with an ad. that had been given to the op
position paper. Showing a reckless disregard fo
the welfare of the nation generally, as well as an
absolute indifference that the Egyptian questior
is not yet settled, that oeneral Gordon still re
mains cooped up in Khartoum, that the federation
and recidiviste difficulties have yet to be deter
mined, that the monster cabbage and abnor
mal turnip await a laudatory par., and tha
the proprietors of the cat and monkey cir
eus — which recently visited the township
" and gave pleasure to all ” — had contractec
for a gushing critique of at least half a
column, this erudite scribe devotes just aboul
a column of leaded “long-primer” to a laments
tion over that lost ad., instead of bringing his
mighty intellect to bear on one or all of the topics
above noted. Thus, you see, we are driven to the
sad though inevitable conclusion that the “live
ad.” is dearer to the agricultural editor than his
country, his God, or even strict veracity. Still, ii
is cheering to note that although he has been
“euchred,” so to speak, in this instance, yet he if
to a certain extent defiant, and, withal, hopeful
He administers a sly dig in the ribs to the local ad-
mirers of “ King William III., of glorious, pious,’
&<;., by saying, “ We admit there are some quarters
where we are not very welcome, c.g., among thost
who celebrate the 13th of .7ulyas their great day
of jubilee, and we have no doubt these politico-
religious wire-pullers would like to see the Guar-
dian snuffed out. But we are not, nor do we mean
to be, just yet.” Thus he shouts defiance to his
foes, and the “ Derry boys ” are now calling on thi
rocks, or mountains, or something, to fall upon
them and “ bury them dacent.” And then ho winds
up this scathing leader by expressing a hope that
the time is not far distant wben his patter will be
found in every house in the district. Well, that
depends what kind of a country trade the Iocs
butter-man is driving,

and, on Sunday, the 3rd, they trotted out Bishop
Moorhouse to make an onslaught on the general
pocket. The number of people in Melbourne who
can draw big houses is small. Emelie Melville,
Bishop Moorhouse, Genevieve Ward, and Joseph
Symes are about the only names you can rely on
to crowd a building. Others hit from time to time,
but there is no certainty about them. The public
appreciates good work, and, dull as it is reputed
to be, it sees pretty quickly where it is being got
at, whether the artist professes to be a great
original writer, a consecrated divine, or a leading
opera boutfer. And, when the public feels it is
being had, it doesn’t come thst way often
after. It therefore follows that all scamped work
perishes, and the moral is brought forth that any-
thing worth doing at all is worth doing well, and
that the economy of time or labour which is made to
justify inefficiency is the seed of death in the work.
1'hat’s pretty solemn. But we want to have some
piece of earnest truth in this paragraph. Seeing
that we started to tell what Bishop Moorhouse
said in the Coburg church, we felt it was now or
I never. The Bishop straightened himself, and told
the people he wanted money for the old church.
Now, it was known to everybody that there was a
deal of human suffering in Melbourne at that very
time. Here is where the Bishop proved himself an
artist. He at once admitted there was human suf-
fering, any amount of it. No scamped Work there!
No blinking a fact, and making believe it didn’t
exist I That’s what your minor artist does. But
look at Genevieve, or Emelie, or Vernon, or Glover
—in their parts they are just like the Bishop. Ah,
we have known ecclesiastics, and they were our
friends, and we liked them to be esteemed geniuses,
but we could never get them when outward bound
for money to state plumply that the white faces of
the poor were staring up at them. And so the con-
gregation were divided in mind. They saw their
artist was suppressing something, and lacked bold-
ness to face them fully. It was not this way with
the Bishop. “The poor are there,” said the Bishop;
“ yes, they are around us. And they want money.
That is true. But Indiscriminate almsgiving is a
positive evil. It is against the law of God to pau-
perise the people. There must be poverty—there
must be suffering. Sin is bound to produce these.
It might be positively injurious to a man if he had
instant relief granted from the sorrow and suffer-
ing he brought on himself by sin.” The Bishop’s
argument was “ Therefore let the white faces stare,
and fork out for my old walls.” Now, we’d like to
see Glover in the pulpit in that same part. Emelie
and Genevieve in their own line could, we believe,
do it as well, but we’d like to see Glover or Vernon
try it.
The meeting of the Emperors has received
a due acknowledgment at the hands of fervid
chroniclers. It has been sung in song, and lipped
in eloquence. But age has been telling on it, and,
despite the charm ot strain and period, we were
beginning to regard the contemplation of it as
wearying, when Providence, ever careful to teed
the human mind with large occurrences, stepped
in with a glorious substitute. The theatre was a
room in Monzies'i Hotel, Melbourne. The epoch
was the 3nd day of the present month. The actors
were M. Pallu do la Barriere, ex-Goveruor of New
Caledonia, and Mr. James Service. Pallu didn’t
know English, and James didn’t know French. But
Pallu was a high-souled Frenchman, and James
was v. high-souled Scotchman, a- d both were phe
nomenally broad-so'ed ; and what mattered the
fact that neither knew what the other was talkini;
about ? At it they went. Awake now, ye histori-
cal scribes, and grind out your chapter on the new
turning-point of nations. A wake uoav, ye poetical
rhapsodists, and hang stanzas irom the noses of

James: “Come on. About them people, about

quo—I nearly forget my French, Monserr, it’s

“That’s what I say. We’re all in the one
boat. Wnen I took the subject up about them
people—aha, le su.jet, you can grip me, Monserr;
when I took lesujetup—I nearly forget my French,

About them people ” (laying hold of the de-
canter). Pallu: “ Voila mes sentiments.” James:
“ You know about it ? Weil, I kept it up. That s
my way. The country rose against them peopW,
them people—aha, que—I nearly forget my French,
Monserr; aha, them people que .” Pallu: “Ceja

my French, Monserr, but I’m glad to find Id
making my meaning clear about them people-,
Them people, you see, que, que, aha, monserr. „
Pallu: “Aha, Monsieur.” James: “Aha, aha.
Pallu: “Aha, aha!” The journals next day re-
Eorted that although Mr. service found the French
inguage had slipped from his memory he had yet
managed to impress upon M. Barriere his convic-
tions regarding the relapsed prisoners’ questions.
The source of this report was, however. Mr. ser-
vice himself, and his native modesty forbade a
truthful exposition of the matter. Our exposition
of it is but bald. But, don’t you remember, we
called on the historical scribe and the poetical
rhapsodist to awake ? Give the lads time to yawn
and scratch their heads and empty out their talents

The model of this girl’s frock with blouse bodice is of white cambric, but would look
equally well lu any kind of washing of woollen material. Three flounces, tucked
and edged with embroidery, trim the skirt. The short bodice, closed at the back
with buttons, has a pleated plastron in front, edged, as is also the neck-opening
and half long sleeves, with insertion and embroidery. Lightly gathered basques,
trimmed with embroidery, and mounted on a narrow stuff band, hidden by a
coloured silk belt, complete this pretty frock.
The crown of this round hat of white straw is four and a half inches high, and covered
with lightly puffed yellow figured net. The turned up edge of the flat brim is
bound with a full stripe of pink ottoman velvet. A large bow of pink ottoman
ribbon fastened with a yellow agraffe forms the sole trimming.
