Cigarettes definitely need protective wrapping
to keep them fresh and pure. Climatic changes,
and the odour of cardboard and printed surfaces, very
quickly affect the quality of the tobacco.
B.D.V. “Everfresh” wrapping is climate-proof. It
guarantees that the pure imported Virginia tobacco
which is used exclusively in manufacture reaches you
—wherever or whenever you buy B.D.V’s—in the same
perfect condition as when it left the factory.

HIS BOOKS
The New Model
Karl Marx, after many years among
the poor of Soho, acquired a reluctant
admiration for the English character.
He pointed out that, though England had
originated the blackest examples of capi-
talism, yet it had never failed, after a
while, to introduce reforms. He attri-
buted this to moral fire combined with
the national passion for free speech.
The English are the smuggest, most
self-satisfied of people; but from
Chaucer onwards they have welcomed
novelists, playwrights and painters who
exposed their weaknesses and suggested
cures. It is a sign of the times, which
some regard as ominous, that the prac-
tice has almost stopped. Galsworthy was
the last writer of note to show up social
abuses with the object of getting them
rectified. The younger novelists and
playwrights offer little but depressing
problem-pictures which, they imply, have
no answer.
Australia trails after England—a de-
cade" or so behind, as usual. There is a
post-Armistice spirit of optimism about
nearly all pur recently-published books,
due partly, no doubt, to the celebrated
national casual ness, but partly also to
the unpredictable behavior of our offi-
cials. It is wise to play for safety in a
country whose moral guardians are cap-
able of banning “Brave New World,”
welcoming propaganda for tribadism like
“Design for Living” and condemning the
late editors of “Farrago” as “blasphemers
and disloyalists.”
Meanwhile novels that teem with blas-
phemy and disloyalty, as Melbourne Uni-
versity and Melbourne “Argus” under-
stand these things, pour in from London ;
and most of them get past our incompre-
hensible censors.
Study in Misery
Graham Greene’s It’s a Battlefield
(Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.) is a typical London
novel of despair. Life is the muddled
battlefield on which the characters wage
a ceaseless fight whose only happy end-
ing is death. They are associated through
one Drover, who is awaiting execution
for murdering a policeman. A decent
home-loving ’bus-driver, he got mixed up
in a riotous crowd, and committed the
crime while attempting to protect his
wife. His wife loves him, but can’t even
remain faithful till he is hanged. He is
reprieved, and tries (but fails) to commit
suicide, being unable to stand the thought
of spending 15 years without his wife.
His brother, the wife’s unwilling be-
trayer, makes a crazy attempt to shoot
the Commissioner of Police, and is hap-
pily killed by a car. The wife lives on.
So does her sister, who snatches occa-
sional moments of joy from life’s bitter
struggle in casual intrigues. She had
always felt rested and relaxed after these
experiences till she spent a night with
Jules, whom she loves.
You expected such a damned lot from
love, a unique excitement, a quality of
everlastingness; no value remained un-
shaken when love was this: Jules with you
and then Jules further away than he had
ever been, cute and cocksure and self-satis-
lied, studying his face in a mirror.
The Commissioner is the most closely-
observed character. This tragic figure is
at heart the same man as the frustrated
hero of “The Name of Action,” Mr.
Greene’s brilliant first novel. The end
finds the Commissioner alive, yet not
altogether wretched; there is still his
futile work.
The Marooned Classes
A Page from Life, by Biddy Worger
(Sampson Low : Angus and Robertson ;
7s. 6d.), describes a day in the lives of
Londoners most of whom belong to the
same class as the Drovers. They are
cheerier than the others; their problems
are less pressing. Lily Higgins, aged 17,
is in trouble. She tells Mrs. Robinson,
her employer, and Mrs. Robinson urges
marriage on the young man, who is will-
ing ; only he has lost his job. As in many
novels of the sort,
the one alto-
gether normal,
contented and
clear-headed char-
acter is a street-
walker. Nellie
Haggit consents to marry George,
a window-cleaner, hut doubts if she
can go straight. She discusses the
subject with him, and he utters hor-
rible threats as to what will happen
if she fails him ; but that she will
is of course inevitable. The study
ends with a death ; one of those sordid
yet beautiful working-class deaths in
which the neighborliness and sense of
duty of the London poor are revealed.
In other ages there was hope in this
world, as well as in the next, for the
English poor. Before the industrial revo-
lution they could migrate, if only to the
next parish. Afterwards there were the
expanding cities, and, as a last resource,
the colonies or America. Since the war
first America and then the colonies have
become inaccessible. A cable of last
week mentioned that thousands of women
had recently returned to England from
Canada, S. Africa, Australia and M.L.
Sovietism seemed to be an escape for a
while, but that dream soon faded. There
are no Communists in A Page front Life,
and the-Communists in It’s a Battlefield
are figures of fun—silly old posturers with
money like Mr. Surrogate, proletarians
who loathe one another as much as they
do “Winston,” whom they look forward
to stringing up to a lamp-post when the
revolution dawns. The rank and file have
examined Communism, and found it is
simply capitalism with State substituted
for private bosses, and work and wagery
still left as the lot of 90 p.c. of the
people. Socialisation of credit, expro-
priation of banks and Douglas Creditism
don’t appeal to many either. They have
heard all the glowing promises made by
the advocates of these devices from other
politicians in connection with individual-
ism and unionism, Cobdenism and Pro-
tectionism, Little Englandism and Im-
perialism, pacifism and militarism.
Virtue and Christianity are out of date.
The race is to the cunning, the fight to
the strong and ruthless ; the marooned
nine-tenths can do nothing but grin and
bear it. Such is the dreary message which
most of England’s younger writers have
for the world.
Red Page.
The Corridor
Poland’s Access to the Sea (George
Allen and Unwin ; 18s. 6d.) is frankly
propaganda ; but it is propaganda of an
unusual kind. The author, Casimir
Smogorzewski, lets the facts speak.
In brief, his case is this: Poland’s life
depends on access to the sea —on the
possession of the maritime province of
Pomorze (Pomerania), leading to the
“free city” of Danzig and the new Polish
port, Gdynia. The recovery of this pro-
vince is not of real moment to Ger-
many, but its Polish occupation is
a slight upon Prussian pride, and the
repartition of Poland would be
attempted the moment there was any
prospect of success. The author does
not expect to convince avowed opponents
as to the right and justice of Poland’s
position ; his appeal is to the outside
world. For, in the end, the independence
of reborn nations like Poland and
Czecho-Slovakia must depend upon the
attitude of the Powers.
The book falls into two parts. The
first deals with the reconstitution of
Poland at the Versailles Treaty, passes
on to show how, but for the Baltic ports,
she would be strangled, and concludes
with an account of “the miracle” of
Gdynia—of the building of the Polish
port and creation of a Polish mercantile
marine. The second is the important
part. It is the statement of Poland’s
claim to Pomorze on historical, linguistic,
racial and cultural grounds. The claim
is unanswerable. Pomorze has been a
Polish province for over 1000 years.
Twice in that period it has been ruled
by foreigners: once for 146 years (1308
to 1454), when it was under the domina-
tion of the Teutonic Order ; and again
for 148 years (1772-1920), khen it was

In all kinds of weather...
in all types of service...
on all kinds of roads...in
every country in the
world... the All-Weather
Tread of Goodyear Tyres
is famous for its non-skid
qualities.
Aptly named - ALL-
WEATHER-this dia-
mond-shaped tread,
which has remained
basically unchanged for
over 25 years, is truly
faithful to its name.
Whether the roads be
dry or wet, good or bad,
hard or muddy, you can
always be sure of safe,
slipless grip when you
ride on Goodyear Tyres,
with the All-Weather
Tread ...
Because Goodyear Tyres
ha*ve traction in the
CENTRE of the tread,
where it belongs. Those
big, deep-cut, sharp-
edged blocks of rubber
bite right down to solid
footing, and HOLD.
...so, with present prices
so low, it is not surprising
that it is truer than ever:
"more people ride on
Goodyear Tyres than on
any other tyre."

occupied by Prussia after the Partition.
But the pitiless rule of the Order and
the policy of Bismarck and Von Biilow
failed to effect its Germanisation. Apart
from the “free city,” the census of 1921
gives the percentage of Germans as 18.7,
while in 1931 that of non-Poles is 10.1.
Culturally again, Poland, as a Catholic
country, finds herself most in sympathy
with France. These points do not need
laboring, nor does the claim that such an
“island” as East Prussia is necessarily a
“geographical monstrosity.” There are
some 14 similar “islands” in the world
to-day.
What Smogorzewski does not suffi-
ciently stress is the mixed ethnic
character of Germany. The claim
that it is ethnically homogeneous—the
“Nordic Myth”—is persistently used,
inter alia, to excuse the Jewish persecu-
tions, and to impugn Poland’s claim to
the eastern provinces. There could, in
fact, be no more flagrant error than to
equate the “Germanic” or “Nordic” race
with Germany. It is false history, false
philology, false anthropology.
The truth, and it is the key to much
of European history, is that west of the
Elbe is Germany, east of the Elbe the
country is more or less Germanised. In
the sixth century the Slav conquests ex-
tended to the Elbe; in the tenth cen-
tury the Vistula peoples, as described by
the traveller Wolf, are unmistakably
Slavs. Old Prussian, which comparatively
recently became extinct, was a Slav
tongue, closely akin to Russian. In the
thirteenth century came the Mongol in-
vasions, and that horror has permanently
left its impress on the racial character
of the eastern portion of the country.
Speech may become Germanic, but
“skulls are harder than consonants,” and
every anthropologist knows that the
dolichocephalic (long-headed) Nordic
skull occurs only sporadically east of the
Elbe; knows, too, of the flat occiput
and “disharmonic” face that consistently
do occur there. Some also know of the
obstructions that the Prussian Govern-
ment used to put in the way of anthro-
pologists taking those skull measure-
ments which are a sure index of purity,
or impurity, of race. To sum up: the
“German” claim to the eastern provinces
is based, not upon race, but upon con-
quest.
C. K.
A Soviet Balance Sheet
The First Five-year Plan, published by
the State Planning Commission of the
U.S.S.R., is a romance or a dreary story,
according to the political affiliations of
the reader. If you believe that the
greatest happiness of the greatest number
is the proper aim of society and can be
achieved by mass action directed to the
production of material things by a cen-
tralised Administration, then you may find
the enormous array of figures relating to
turbines, blooming mills, caterpillar
tractors and the rest of it entrancing. If
you’re an unbeliever, then the book will
be no more interesting than the last
annual report of the Vic. State Electricity
Commission. Moreover, figures can be
made to prove anything, and the report
on its own performance by a State execu-
tive is at least as open to suspicion' as
that of any joint-stock company.
Nevertheless, the report does reveal a
gigantic attempt to replace the waste and
confusion of. competitive economy with
ordered development. The trouble is
that the initiative does not come from
the people, despite Communist theory to
the contrary. If somebody in office
thinks the State wants caterpillar tractors
then it gets caterpillar tractors, even if
what the individual wants is pictures,
soap, houses or flivvers. To inculcate in
the breast of the multitude a passion for
caterpillar tractors as against flivvers, the
individual is subjected to a terrific meal
of propaganda, at the end of which he
is thinking exactly what the executive
wants him to think. If the executive has
made a miscalculation about the tractors,
as executives are liable to do, then it has
to depropagand its victims —a lengthy
process, as Lloyd George found when he
tried to convince the British people that,
after all he had said, Germany couldn’t
pay the whole cost of Armageddon. If
the plan fails to produce an immediate
return in general happiness, then the
temptation will be to announce that the
nation is in danger, and to concentrate
on a bigger army, since fear will make
people submit to almost any sacrifice.
An interesting part of the report re-
lates to the way the proletarian Im-
penahsts have swept down on the sub-
sidiary republics. Nomads have been
turned into factory workers; native
children have been taught to read and
write so that they can recite the revo-
lutionary slogans; peasants have been
turned into collective farmers.
The report mentions that Trotsky was
expelled from the party because he
wanted world revolution before internal
development. The Stalinites were no
doubt right from their standpoint.

“Pandemonium”
The February and March issues of this
new Melbourne monthly reached the
writer together. It is the kind of journal
that any city with a Melbourne Sabbath,
a Melbourne University and a Mel-
bourne “Argus” might be goaded into
producing—-a thorny garland of sneers
clapped, spikes downwards, on the smug
forehead of Respectability. That would
be quite all right if the sneererfi’ dialecti-
cal methods were right. Many of them
recall one of Philip Guedalla’s sayings:
“After all, doesn’t most criticism consist
in objecting to something that one never
said?” A few examples:
(1) In Sydney the uproar [against Major
Douglas] only stopped short of the mea-
sures taken by the citizens of Adelaide when
Elijah Dowie attempted to save their souls.
Yet all that the Major did was to put, in
a very calm voice and an unassuming
manner, to the people that theirs was a
faulty financial system; and he advanced
proposals for remedying the fault.
(2) Archbishops—the same who now
declare, in the midst of appalling poverty
and degradation, that the Church has no
concern with economics—climbed into the
rostrum [when the depression began] and
declared that the children were being pun-
ished for the sins of their fathers.
(3) The screen is the great unconscious
clinic of contemporary society, where all the
misfits and failures have their mental
bunions presented as evidences of bound-
ing health and vitality. Marlene Dietrich
replaced Greta Garbo, and she will be
replaced in her turn.
There was no uproar over Major
Douglas in Sydney. His sparsely-attended
Stadium meeting was as placid as a
sewing-bee. “Pandemonium” refers
elsewhere to a
legend that Mr. Lyons had under his
hat an infallible panacea for the country’s
industrial sickness, and could cure it with-
out reference to the general international
malaise.
Substitute “Douglas” for “Lyons” and
you get the claim that the Major made
in his Stadium speech ; but all efforts
to extract details from him of how his
plan would banish unemployment here
in three months were unavailing.
A search of the files failed to discover
any archbishop who discussed the de-
pression in the recriminatory spirit sug-
gested by “Pandemonium.” Archbishops
don’t say such things, even when, as in
this case, they happen to be true.
And Marlene Dietrich hasn’t replaced
Greta Garbo. Garbo is irreplaceable this
side of middle age, and Dietrich has
always been a nonentity beside her. The
stuff about the screen being a clinic
where bunions are presented as evidences
of health is equally silly ; it has a fine
rolling sound but there’s neither truth
nor sense in it.
The best features of ‘TPandemonium”
are “The Literary Idea in Painting,” by
Max Meldrum, and some sardonic
drawings by Mervyn Skipper—both in
the March issue. It deserves to live for
its courage, and it will live if those in
charge can persuade its propagandists to
get their premises right before they begin
arguing from them.
D.
Diet
About the most important medical
book ever issued has just been published
by the Medical Research Council. Its
importance lies in the fact that it is
devoted to an expert study of the food
we eat and how it can cause disease.
Some years ago, when a small group of
doctors began to talk of the importance
of diet, they were laughed at (even by
their colleagues) as food cranks. The
day has come when the laugh is on the
former sneerers, and the new volume,
which can fairly claim to represent
expert medical opinion throughout the
world, amply proves that to-day’s crank
is often to-morrow’s apostle of wisdom.
Briefly, the Research Council empha-
sises that much of the food we eat is
unsuitable because of the high and inten-
sive preparation it undergoes. Feed
experimental animals on the ordinary
civilised diet of human beings and they
die of every kind of human disease,
from gallstones to tuberculosis. Give
animals overcooked food and remove all
fresh stuff from their diet and the same
result is seen.
There is now a long list of vitamins
which are readily recognisable. There
are the old ones, Vitamins A, B, C, D
and E, but B is split into a number of
divisions called the “Vitamin B Com-
plex,” and is composed of 81, 82, 83,
84, 85. If these are absent from the
diet various diseases, like beri-beri and
pellagra, develop in man. Abscesses
develop in animals deprived of Vitamin
A, and not a few contract lung disease.
This vitamin is plentiful enough in
nature, occurring in milk, eggs, butter,
fresh vegetables. It is also found in
fish-liver oils. Milk and eggs are the
most valuable vitamin foods we have,
each being the possessor of almost every
vitamin. A child deprived of milk will
be definitely diseased in some form or
other. The yolk of the egg is the part
that matters, and when one considers
that a chicken emerges from it after
three weeks’ heating it is not to be won-
dered at that it is such a powerful life-
giving article of diet.
The question of sterility in the human
has long puzzled the medical profession.
Probably it is on the way to being solved
by diet. In male rats and mice lack of
Vitamin E causes a gradual loss of repro-
ductive power leading to complete and
incurable sterility within 85 to 150 days.
A well-known research student found a
gradual degeneration of vital parts of
the male glands when examined under
the microscope only 35 days after Vita-
min E had been removed from the diet.
What part Vitamin E plays in the body
is not quite clear. It is known that it
appears in articles of food like the green
leaves and embryos of seeds. From
wheat germ, an oil can be extracted
which will cure sterility in female rats.
It is also present in milk and butter and
in certain parts of animal tissue.
Without doubt medicine is entering
an era of prevention. For a long time
“diagnosis” has been the password of
medical schools, even overriding treat-
ment. Medical schools throughout the
world are at present arranging to revise
their syllabus. Already an American
committee has reported on a general
revision for all American and Canadian
universities, one of the outstanding com-
ments of the report being that there
should be a “permeating of all teach-
ing with the idea of prevention.” This
publication by the Medical Research
Council should play a most important
part in such permeating.

A Satchel of Books
Threebrooks, by George Berrie
(Stephensen; 7s. 6d.). A first-class yarn
which introduces the hero, David Halli-
day, as a Sydney University football star
in 1908, and traces his tangled career
to a happy ending. The trouble was
caused, as often happens in romances of
this type, by the abandonment of a baby
by a distracted mother. There are some
fine and knowledgeable descriptions of
life outback, both in Westralia and in
the east.
The Death of Laurence Viriing, by
Alan Thomas, which has been repub-
lished by Benn’s at 3s. 6d., contains one
of the cleverest murder schemes in fic-
tion. Vining—himself a criminologist
with a keen nose for a murderer —de-
serves his fate. The enemy who kills
him, and gets away with it, makes the
usual mistake. Inspector Widgeon says
to him grimly: —
I know the man who did this murder,
but he is safe: for I have not now, nor
shall I ever have, any shred of evidence
against him.
The characterisation is particularly good.
Verandah Out West, by Morris Hay
(Deaton and Spencer; Gordon and
Gotch ; 6s.). A boy-and-girl story set
on a N.S.W. sheep station. Ronnie’s the
boy, and the girl is Cicely. Other char-
acters are a designing female who wears
town clothes, a lunatic who chases cars
and a Scotch stockman. Listen to
Ronnie: —
Poetry! Ah! what a paltry word to ex-
press so much! Six tiddly winking little
letters to tell of the burning fire of the
heart pouring out the unutterable depths of
the despair that is man's inheritance! One
single word seeking hopelessly to contain
within itself all the grandeur of Life, and
all the power, might, majesty and dominion
of —Death!
He’s making love to the designing female
at the time.
Give Me My Robe, by Ursula Leigh
(Heritage; 7s. 6d.). Evelyn Dawson
finds the Canadian girl Hannah in a
prairie brothel. In spite of her way of
life, she is a pure and faithful soul, and
he eventually marries her and takes
her to Halifax. Among the phrases
which he has repeated to her, and which
have stuck in her memory, is Cleopatra’s
immortal farewell to life. When the
hotel in Halifax catches fire, the words
come back to her mind, and she goes
to her end happily. The study of the
girl’s strange nature is penetrating, and
there are some lovely little pictures of
the Canadian terrain. A self-conscious
simplicity of style detracts from the
drama, and Dawson sacrifices the
reader’s sympathy by telling Hannah a
whopping war-lie.
We turned the machine-guns on them.
It was like mowing hay at a distance....
They were all kids: the eldest about six-
teen. There were some that might have
been about twelve.
Why should the Germans have put 12-
year-olds into the front line? As regards
man-power, they were no worse off than
the French or British when the Armis-
tice arrived.

BIG-CITYISM COLLAPSES.
Politicians and wage-fixers are sure
that the good times, as they are called,
are coming back. Wool, which was round
about 9d. a pound for three of the depres-
sion years and moved up to Is. 6d. this
season, may go still higher. “Dollar”
wheat will return. The basic wage will
rise again to £4 ss. a week —with, in N.
S. Wales, ss. more for every child after
the first. Cash orders will boom again;
and everyone—or nearly everyone —will
have a time-payment car. And there will
be another grand burst of borrowing,
sufficient for all the electioneering works
that can be thought of; sufficient also for
the payment of award wages to everyone
who needs a Government job. These
beliefs are even held by the unemployed,
and help to sustain them.
But suppose they are all wrong. Sup-
pose the price of wool is as high as it
will go, and will come down rather than
rise again. Suppose our wheat-farmers
will have to make shift with a world-
parity price of 3s. a bushel or there-
abouts. Suppose we shall get no great
margin of profit on anything else we
export, gold excepted. What are we
going to do about it? What are our
plans for accommodating ourselves to a
simpler life?
We have no such plans. As a nation
we are simply drifting on in the expec-
tation that the days of plenty will return.
We are none of us alive to what the tre-
mendous growth of Japan as an indus-
trial nation means to all of us; and be-
hind Japan looms the even more menac-
ing figure of China. Admittedly parts
of the Empire which have to meet the
first shock of Japanese competition real-
ise what it imports to them, and are
sorely troubled. Manchester, for its part,
feels that Japanese competition is an
omen of ruin to the Lancashire cotton
trade, and that is one of the great sources
of Imperial wealth. Birmingham, too,
finds the Japanese underselling it in
markets in which it has hitherto been
supreme. From Greenland to Patagonia
the story is told of Japanese penetration
in markets where, in pre-depression
times, Japanese wares were never seen.
The home markets of the Empire are
themselves assailed, and such are the
ingenuity and industry of the Japanese
and so low are their wage-rates —low,
judged by our standards, though critical
observers allow that the factory workers
are not sweated or housed in slums —
that only by making full use of tariffs as
defensive weapons can these markets be
held.
Possibly the star of Western opulence
is setting. Paradoxically, while the most
powerful Asiatic nation is challenging the
West in fields where Westerners thought
themselves unchallengeable, the West
looks more and more to the East for
purchasers of its own produce. But the
East is poor. The toiling myriads of
Oriental peoples cannot pay normal
Western prices for what they have hither-
to regarded as luxuries. Owing to over-
production in the West, they have, since
1930 or 1931, been able to get these
goods at what they consider a fair price,
and even to pick and choose. For
example, they bought huge quantities of
Australian wheat and flour when it was
offered to them at prices which mean a
loss to the grower, but when they found
they could get cheaper wheat and flour
from the U.S.A., on long credit at that,
the trade in Australian wheat and flour
fell away to nothing.
The depression is now in its fifth year,
and plainly the end is not yet. There
is a possibility that we may have a
second innings of it, as the Americans
had. The second innings might be
brought about by the capture of the
Commonwealth Parliament and Govern-
ment by the wild men who undertake to
perform miracles once they are given
control of banking and currency, and
who may be placed in that position
by the support of selfish organised
interests and by the feeling—it undoubt-
edly exists among large masses of the
population—that no change can be for
the worse. Whether this disaster is in store
for us or not, it is plain that the coastal
capitals have ceased to be able to carry
50 p.c. of the mainland population—
more than 50 p.c. in Adelaide and Mel-
bourne.
The Big City policy is played out. For
their own good and for Australia’s good,
a great many city-dwellers who now
line up for the dole and pitiful scraps of
emergency-relief work will have to be
transferred to where, with the develop-
ment of inland towns and industry and
of neglected ports, life will offer them
something more than a demoralising de-
pendence on charity. For a start, as in
other countries, willing and resourceful
people should be placed on subsistence
farms. Italy, poor as it is, has done
great things in this field. Australia, with
ample resources and an adaptable people,
is doing next to nothing.
THE LATEST LANG PLAN.
The Easter Conference of the Lang
Labor party was a “remarkable and in-
spiring demonstration of harmony, loyalty
and unity”—according to the “Labor
Daily.” All was peace except for a
“long and heated argument” over the
annual report; a fight over expelled
members ; an “uproarious scene” over a
motion by one of the Messrs. McNamara ;
accusations that the unions had “dumped
the unemployed,” and that Mr. Lang and
his fellow-Ms.L.A. had done nothing for
them; a “lively interlude” about chain
stores, during which a delegate was in-
vited to “walk out”; a heated discussion
about the repayment of the Miners’
Federation loan, and a charge, “amidst
uproar,” that 54 Laborites had only sup-
ported Langism in Parliament because
they were afraid to oppose it.
Mr. Lang said in his speech that the
Labor movement “must find a place in
the scheme of things for the dispossessed
youth of the Commonwealth.” Except
that the bigger half of those who lost
their deposits in the Savings Bank crash
were young, there is no evidence that
youth has been dispossessed any more
than other sections of the community.
However, there are a lot of new electors
at every election and Labor needs to bid
for every vote it can get these days.
Of course, a new policy egg was laid
with the customary cackle. No Easter
Conference is complete without one.
But it should be understood by the
young, as well as by their elders, that
it is only an egg; one from which
Langism means ultimately to hatch the
“socialisation of industry, production, dis-
tribution and exchange.”
Each conference is concerned to create
an illusion that its egg is the ultimate
objective. Of course, this is not so. From
socialisation of the banks, the young are
to be led to socialisation of credit; then
to socialisation of everything—a method
entirely in keeping with Soviet technique,
as elucidated by Lenin in April, 1917:
The fundamental step towards complete
socialisation must be such measures as the
nationalisation of banks and trusts Let
us put into practice these and similar mea-
sures and we shall see Through the
nationalisation of the banks smaller in-
terests will be tied hand and foot We
must maintain the support of the small
property owners at this stage If we
throw away our weapons, we lose our
heads; if we lose our heads, we lose
everything.
The first step in the new “immediate”
policy of the party was crystallised last
September as “socialisation of credit —
nationalisation of the banks without ex-
propriation of deposits.” It very evi-
dently, however, involved expropriation
of credit, since the securities of the banks
—that is, of depositors and shareholders
—were to be used, inter alia, to “provide
employment at standard rates in public
works of a reproductive character” and
to “increase the purchasing power of
money.” The credit used would naturally
be the people’s credit — i.e., the credit
which is inherent in life-assurance
policies, bank accounts, homes and salary
and wage earnings. Yet it is clear that a
security cannot be exploited by both
people and Government at the same time.
A security, when an overload of borrow-
ing is placed on it, behaves in the same
way as a wharf-laborer when a 4001 b.
sack is put on his back. It fails to carry
the burden.
Mr. Lang, as a property-owner versed
in finance, is probably far from anxious
to see this side of his policy implemented.
It is simply a bait for the volatile
minority on whom his fate depends. He
has solid supporters who are with his
party through thick and thin. They have
never known how to associate with
another party, and, anyhow, apostasy to
them would mean ruin at the hands of
blacklisting union secretaries. For these
permanent voters the Langs and Gardens
do not need to cater. All that is neces-
sary is to keep a tight enough hold to
retain them in the fold —hence the new
tariff policy, which is liable to turn the
Customs Department into a Labor
control bureau, and be used indiscrimi-
nately by an unscrupulous Labor Gov-
ernment in power either to buy or
blackmail support from manufacturers
or to dragoon recalcitrant unionists.
The rest of the programme is aimed at
annexing the swinging vote of the feather-
headed by pandering to the fetich of the
moment. This happens to be Douglasism.
The September, 1933, A.L.P. programme,
as The Bulletin pointed out some time
ago, is almost wholly Douglas. The
Easter programme intensifies the like-
ness. It adds to the previously stolen
Douglas ideas the project which the
Major put forward in Maoriland the
other day for a compulsory Government
audit of all balance sheets —a scheme
which would immediately double the
strength of the civil service. It adopts,
too, in modified form, Douglas’s “com-
pulsory liquidation of surplus and
watered capital dividends.”
Mr. Lyons should take note of the
trend of Langist “gradualism.” Unless
he and the Country party get together
—and soon —they may find the
“gradualists” in the Commonwealth Par-
liament after the election for which they
are already preparing as a strong third
party pledged virtually to Douglas-credit-
ism. If that happens, the blame will lie
with the U.A.P. There is no valid reason
why the two parties that stand for
national honesty and solvency shouldn’t
be as friendly throughout the Common-
wealth as they are in N. S. Wales.
WINES AND NAMES.
Dear Bulletin,— The article entitled
“Wines and Names” (B. 14/3/’34) is so ex-
traordinarily misleading in character that
1 am most regretfully compelled to ask for
space to reply. “French wines,” the con-
tributor asserts, “are going out of favor
in Britain. A reason is that they are not
what they were. It is notorious that
wines from Syria, Algeria and Morocco
are blended nowadays with the produce
of France, and sold abroad as French.”
Not having the mastery of English
which permits me to attribute a precise
meaning to the phrase “it is notorious,”
I am not sure whether your contributor
means “it is a fact,” or “it is believed”
or “it is convenient for business rivals
to assert.” If, however, it means “it is
a fact” that these transactions take place
and affect the business relations of the
world, I can only say that he is lament-
ably misinformed.
Let me deal with these allegations,
first of all as to the production of wines
in the three colonies mentioned:
(1) Morocco. —Morocco produces no
wine at all for export. There are vine-
yards of comparatively small area, but
their production (6,220,000 gallons in 1931)
is consumed in Morocco itself. Morocco
imports fair quantities of French wines
(390,000 gallons in 1932).
(2) Syria.—This country produces some
purely ordinary wine*, all consumed in
Syria. Like Morocco she has to import
Wines from France (52,223 gallons in 1932).
(3) Algeria.—This colony has for some
years exported large quantities of a rather
heavy type; her export figures for 1932
were approximately 270 million gallons out
of a production that year of 403 million
gallons. Yet Algeria imported that yeaf
500,000 gallons of French wines.
The imported wines from Algeria are
undoubtedly sold in France as vins
ordinaires and often retailed under the
name of vins d’Algerie. But it is untrue
to suggest that these are then exported
from France (either mixed or unmixed
with vintage wine) under false labels.
The law, which is most rigorously applied,
punishes such offences —for sale (at home
or abroad) under false labels the penalty
is imprisonment for not less than three
months, ranging up to much longer terms
—’and allows civil action for damages for
all injured by such action. It also pro-
vides for registration and inspection of
stocks ; any person who imports foreign
wine into France has to show what
becomes of it, to whom he sells it, and
any person who purchases it has to do
the same thing. The whole wine industry
of France is united to support this law,
and evasions of it are practically un-
known.
The false application of regional names
is now forbidden in international trade
by a series of international conferences
and treaties which prescribe (broadly)
that no “name of origin” may be applied
to wines produced outside the region
described. This principle is being sup-
ported by a steadily increasing circle of
civilised Powers (including Great Britain)
which regards what I believe should be
called “the goodwill” of a production
extending back over four or five centuries
and of a world-wide reputation to be just
as deserving of recognition and protection
by law in the case of a region as in the
case, of individuals.
So far I have dealt wholly with the
“facts” of your article. They are wholly
untrue, and peculiarly disparaging to
French national and commercial honor.
Now for a comment on your contri-
butor’s arguments. He says “There is no
case in reason, equity or tradition” for
such a “names-monopoly” as France
claims —this means a claim to regional
names, and he gives some illustrations.
The first he quotes *is the use of the
word “beer,” which he also gives in Anglo-
Saxon. This is clearly not a regional
name. It is difficult to see what illumina-
tion the reference to the days of Edward
the Confessor throws on the matter.
His next word is “Pilsener.” He is
quite misinformed when he says that
Trench beer is sold under this title. Pil-
sener beer is sold in France undoubtedly,
but definitely as an importation. The law
which I have described makes anything else
impossible.
He then takes “whisky.” This is no
more a regional appellation than “beer”
and rests quite outside controversy.
The last word is “port.” This is a
regional name. What he says about it is
that much wine beside the produce of
Douro or “Lisbon” is sold under this
name in Great Britain. This is a point on
which I am obviously unqualified to ex-
press any opinion. But if it is so sold, it
is illegally sold, and comparatively recent
British legislation makes it punishable to
sell as “port” wines which are not certifi-
cated by the Portuguese Government as
“port”—/.<?., as produce of the Douro or
“Lisbon” district.
Your contributor contends for no prin-
ciple. He ignores such elementary facts
as that growth in Burgundy, for instance,
connotes certain characteristics in wine.
There is first-class burgundy and there
are lower grades down to the fourth and
fifth, but they are all the products of “the
earth and sun” of that region.
So with champagne. There are only
three departments out of 90 in France
the wine of which may be lawfully de-
scribed as champagne. French law
defines with great particularity the boun-
daries within which any label may be
applied by makers. “Champagne” is
thus a place—a region—although your
contributor does not appear to realise it.
Veuve Cliquot, for example, is another
smaller place within it. No grower a
hundred yards outside the Champagne
boundary (as defined by law) can call his
wine “champagne,” and no grower, even
within Champagne, can call his special
growth “Veuve Cliquot,” except the vine-
yard proprietors.
There are sections of probably hun-
dreds of excellent red wines produced in
Southern Europe, in Spain, Italy and in
France itself the proprietors of which
do not dream of calling them burgundy,
and are forbidden to do so by law. No
Frenchman will deny the excellent quali-
ties of many Australian red wines, but
they are no more burgundy or bordeayx
than is an Italian chianti or a Spanish
barabara.
Australian wheat and Australian
merino wool have set such standards that
the passing of other articles for them
would be palpable dishonesty. I venture
to hazard that if persons outside Aus-
tralia sold as Australian wool not pro-
duced in Australia there would be an
immediate repudiation by Australia of
such claims, and a warning to users not
to be misled into buying such wool.
Australia is most insistent on all goods
coming into Australia having their place
of origin correctly stated. Surely it is
not unreasonable that people outside
Australia should object to Australian
goods being incorrectly branded, and
surely this is also the case in certain
directions with Australian wines. During
the past such strictly local regional names
as Yeringberg, St. Hubert, Chateau Tah-
bilk, Auldana, Cawarra, have all marked
distinctly localised Australian produc-
tions, all of high standards of merit.
There is no need to abandon the prestige
gained by these products, and seek to
substitute for it an artificial one based
upon misrepresentation.

Trade Commissioner for France.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
A.B.C. and B.B.C.
They have been under fire at the same
time. The British concern was attacked
by the London “Daily Herald,” which
asserted that the staff was about to re-
volt because “the methods of the quarter-
deck and the barrack square” had been
introduced by an ex-admiral, who is
called Controller of Administration, and
an ex-colonel, Controller of Programmes.
The director-general, Sir John Reith,
replied forcibly, even going down to the
House of Commons to put his case be-
fore 150 Ministerial members; and no-
thing more has been heard of the
charges.
A.B.C. has attracted the critical gaze
of the Commonwealth Auditor-General.
That functionary questions an allowance
of £5 a week to the general manager for
“out-of-pocket and entertainment ex-
penses”; and he is warranted in ques-
tioning it. The g.m. receives a handsome
salary, plus travelling expenses when he
travels, and this new public department
should be no free entertainment joint.
The A.-G. is also on firm ground in
objecting to the increase in staff since
the Commission took over. It amounts,
he says, to 32.3 p.c.—130 officers were
employed on July 1, 1932, and 172 on
September 9, 1933. The increase in
expenditure was £44,500. Says the
matter-of-fact Mr. Cerutty:
It represents an increase of almost 33
p.c., and appears to be a very high price
to pay for such improvement as has been
made in the programmes.
A very high price it is, and it is not
enough to ask, by way of official reply,
whether the Auditor-General is qualified
to “appraise improvement in the value
of programmes.” Doubtless Mr. Cerutty
listens to them. In any case, he is a
responsible officer, and a very intelli-
gent one ; and if he does not think the
programmes worth the amount of public
money paid for them it is his right and
his duty to say so. Nor is it convincing
to mention, as the A.B.C. chairman did,
the enlarged total of licensed-holders as
proof that the public differs from the
A.-G. There is always a boom in licenses
in a Test-match year.
The general public is carrying far too
many Government employees. It must
feel uneasy when it sees the number
added to by lavish appointments to this
new department, the staff of which will
no doubt soon be qualifying for super-
annuation benefits, partly at the public’s
expense. Nor has the improvement in
programmes been so great considering
that an additional £35,600 was spent in
this field. There has certainly been more
band music and grand-opera music, but
there has also evidently been a greater
use of phonograph records. At all events
the phonograph has taken the place of
a capital little dinner orchestra that en-
tertained people under the other regime.
Moreover, little has been done to en-
courage writers of radio plays, and the
actors who appear in such plays as are
put over are far from being in the highest
flight of the profession. Some are obvi-
ous amateurs.
Encouragement to literature there has
been practically none. It was reported
last week that 8.8. C. had engaged repre-
sentative novelists like Compton Mac-
kenzie, Walter de la Mare and Agatha
Christie to write short stories for it.
A.B.C. has hosts of professors, econo-
mists and schoolmasters on its list, but
authors need not apply. On a revenue
of 4s. 6d. p.a. per listener (the Govern-
ment takes ss. 6d.), 8.8. C. employs the
greatest artists and some of the greatest
writers in Britain. The Australian sub-
scriber pays 245., of which 12s. goes to
A.B.C. Of course, he doesn’t expect to
get the service that 8.8. C. gives, but he
is paying too much for what he gets.
— :
Unwritten Law.
Last week a familiar cable arrived from
America.
Joe Kopman, an orchardist, shot James
Franklin, a negro, dead in the street.
Franklin was suspected of having outraged
Kopman’s daughter. A jury returned a
verdict of justifiable homicide.
On the same day a Narrabri jury re-
turned a similar verdict in the case of
Mrs. Annie Richards, slayer of George
Nott. Nott’s alleged offences were that
he borrowed money from Mrs. Richards,
who had “washed and mended his
clothes and nursed him when ill,” and
abused her when she asked for it. Said
her counsel:
People don’t get punished for killing a
snake or a scorpion! Do you think that
this _ woman should be stamped as a
criminal? In my opinion she ought to get
the praise of the people of New South
Wales. She ought to be rewarded for
what she has done.
There was no evidence other than that
of the accused (given in the form of “a
brief, unsworn statement”) that Nott was
a “pest,” “mongrel” or any of the other
things Mrs. Richards’s counsel called him.
On the contrary. Nott enlisted in the
53rd Battalion, had “a good war record”
and rose to be a sergeant. He served
in the Queensland police after the war,
and his comrades said he was “a decent
man with a good police reputation.” In
and around Burren Junction he was
labelled “a quiet man” and “popular.”
According to Mrs. Richards’s state-
ment, she killed Nott with a stone,
thrown in a moment of anger. Her hus-
band was away, and she, a small,
elderly woman, handled the 17-stone
body unaided, drove it to a suitable
spot and burnt it to a “small, charred
part” in four hours.
Even if deceased had been all that
Mrs. Richards’s counsel accused him of
being when he was no longer alive to
defend his reputation, it didn’t entitle
her to kill him with a stone or other
implement or weapon. People who
attack fellow-humans with objects which
may cause death are liable in law for
all the results of their actions. As the
Judge said in his summing-up: “There
was an alternative in this case. If the
jury did not think deliberate murder was
committed they could bring in a verdict
of manslaughter.”
The jury found the lady guiltless alike
of murder and manslaughter, and thus
established the principle in their district
that a woman who kills an allegedly
abusive man may expect the sympathy
of some Australian juries as well as the
maudlin approval of our flapper press.
It definitely puts Narrabri in line with
the most uncivilised parts of the U.S.A.

Sobering Up.
If the figures in the latest report of the
Victorian Licenses Reduction Board
don’t lie, there should be no pubs be-
tween Cape Howe and Nelson by the
year a.d. 2500. Since 1907 the numbers
have dwindled from 3507 to 1759, and
even with its present restricted powers
the Reduction Board may sentence an-
other 341 to death—lo 4 in the city and
237 in the country. During 1933 a dozen
hostelries went west. In point of
fact, all liquor statistics seem to
be falling down a steep place. In
Australia’s most canny State there
were 18,500 prosecutions for drunken-
ness per annum in 1890, when the popu-
lation was 1,133,000; in 1932, with the
population at 1,810,000, the number was
only 8255. There are only 4.5 prose-
cutions per thousand of population where
there used to be 16.5 50 years ago.
Equally interesting are the figures
showing the trend from drink to drink
and from import to local product. The
year before the war the average con-
sumption of spirits per head of popula-
tion in the whole Commonwealth was
.85 gallons. In 1933 it was .19 gallons,
while beer had fallen from 13.49 gallons
to 7.46 gallons. Wine, however, had
increased from .28 gallons to .50 gallons,
and it is curious to note that, while beer
and spirit consumptions fell substantially
during the depression, the 1933 require-
ment of wine per head was greater than
that of 1930. The Victorian import gal-
lonage has dwindled to 25 p.c. of the
1923 bulk, and such items as foreign.
brandies, gins and rum have been almost
wiped off the wine card.
What the national effect will be re-
mains to be seen. Some of the greatest
men in history literally drank their way
to glory. Alexander the Great was sel-
dom sober while conquering the world.
The political celebrities of the second
half of the eighteenth century—one of
England’s greatest periods—were prac-
tically all topers. Wellington, who in-
dulged in no more than a bottle of
Madeira with dinner, was considered
almost a teetotaller. A century ago a
British general in India reprimanded his
aide for getting drunk and incapable
before dinner, and it was recorded as
one of the hardships of Lord Lake’s
Mahratta campaign that he was “without
claret for as much as about 24 hours.”

The Politician as Artist.
“Nihil Blastus” cuts loose:'—
There is a certain type who, when discussing
an ant, intimates that it is as big as an Alsa-
tian, as beautiful as Chartres Cathedral. We
call him a Romantic. A similar type, when
talking of a political plan, says it will cure un-
employment. We call him a politician.
The chief aim of the politician is his own ad-
vancement, and after that the advancement of
his parasites. How can this be achieved with
the least effort? By practising the eternal art
of delusion.
The successful portrait-painter deludes us
into seeing that in a face which, more often
than not, was never there. The actor deludes
us into believing that the character he por-
trays is real. The poet deludes us into thinking
that what is good and beautiful is true. The
politician deludes us into agreeing that his plan
is the only one that will benefit us.
But, I hear you object, “Art implies Beauty.”
Is the central theme of Dante’s “Inferno”
beautiful? Are Epstein’s women beautiful? Is
“Gulliver” beautiful?
To resume. The average man enjoys hav-
ing his emotions played upon, but if his self-
esteem is injured he gets annoyed. He goes to
a play or reads a poem, has an emotional
feast and rests. He absorbs the outpourings
of a politician, has an emotional feast and
rests. But in this case after rest comes thought.
If he is intelligent he realises presently that
the politician is a humbug; and—more especi-
ally if he has been carried away—his self-
esteem is injured. He looks for a scapegoat.
His thoughts turn to the politician and we
hear that the politician beats his wife, drinks
or is corrupt.
Consequently the politician, to be perma-
nently successful, must be the greatest of all
artists. He must go further than the poet,
the painter or the actor; he must leave a last-
ing impression that his mummery is real. How
does he do it? We see examples of his tech-
nique at every election, at every crisis, and in
every paper. The exploitation of lies, the
concealment of facts, the clouding of vital isues
behind trivial incidents that have a tinsel
glamor or a nightmarish fearsomeness. The
politician issues a statement of blues and
greys with a splash of red in the middle. Our
mind’s eye sees it as a hungry dog sees a
piece of steak on a dusty road. We seize it,
masticate it and, like the dog, forget the back-
ground.
I am not considering statesmen here; only
politicians. I have met hundreds of accom-
plished politicians; never a statesman. It has
been said of statesmen in Australia that they
are not made, but stillborn, and there may be
something in it.

Still a Long Way to Go.
The Commonwealth unemployment
figures for the first quarter of 1934 aren’t
as encouraging as they might be. Out
of unions with 422,000 members, 92,297,
equal to 21.9 p.c., are out of work, and
this, of course, is not a total figure for
all employees. Since only 47 p.c. of
males and 34 p.c. of females over 20
normally belong to unions, it may be
taken that Australians out of work
number 200,000, without counting minors
and those on relief work.
S. Aus. shows the highest percentage
—28.5 p.c. ; and N. S. Wales, despite its
£15,000,000 unemployment Budget and
its 75,000 on relief work, has been the
slowest State to improve since the peak
depression period (first quarter, 1933),
when 26.5 p.c. of alt Australians were on
the dole. Queensland makes the best
showing. Its unemployment is only 13.7
p.c., which compares favorably with the
Commonwealth average in the first
quarter of 1929—9.3 p.c. W.A., which
has shouted so loudly about its miseries,
has recovered fastest.
Two industrial groups still have nearly
a third of union members out of jobs—
wood and furniture workers and build-
ers —but there has been a 30 p.c. improve-
ment in both since 1933. The best-off
employees are the printers with only
11.8 p.c. out. Staple trades—food, drink,
clothing—are next.
Some of the State industrial groups are
almost normal, particularly in Queens-
land, where individual trades show as
low as 6 p.c. out; but the Tasmanian
clothing business holds the belt with
only 5.3 p.c. out, and N.S.W. the booby
prize with 27.4 p.c.
Generally speaking, the more bloated
the capital the worse the unemployment
position of the State which owns it, and
the slower the rate of recovery, even
allowing for artificial and temporary ex-
pedients.

“S.M.H ” and C.P.
From a New England elector:
Is Lyons so indispensable to the U.A.P. that
he can’t be sacrificed on the altar of unity?
Since Page first took the helm of the C.P., the
National party or U.A.P. has had as Federal
leaders Hughes, Bruce, Latham and Lyons. The
loss of the, first three didn’t cause the rank
and file to flaunt their handkerchiefs, and there
is no reason to suspect that the retirement of
“Honest Joe” would evoke enough sobs to
shake the foundations of the party rooms.
It is remarkable that neither in the Federal
nor the State sphere has it been possible to
achieve unity with the Country party when the
other party has been led by an ex-Laborite. If
Lyons is unwilling to apply the salve to bring
together the breach between the two factions,
surely another physician could be found. When
Hughes was landed in a similar quandary he
abdicated in favor of Bruce. In the absence
of Bruce, what is wrong with Hawker? His
acceptance of a portfolio vitally affecting rural
interests was greeted with approbation by pri-
mary producers. The echoes had hardly sub-
sided when his resignation was announced. He
is known to be sympathetic to a large number
of the Country party demands, and he should
be capable of leading a coalition modelled on
Bruce-Page lines.
A recent letter in the “S. M. Herald” seemed
to tread on quite a number of the old girl’s
pet corns, and a leading article under the cap-
tion “Political Infatuation” was the result. The
aged one has been alternately smacking Page
and Lyons for a long time now. In the leader
in question, she gave the Country party several
smart slaps. The C.P.’s demands were said
to be impossible, as there were sections other
than the rural element to be considered. It
was not stated that these demands only asked
for a return to Bruce-Page or pre-Scullin con-
ditions, when all sections of the community
were better off than they are now after four
years of the other experiment. And the party
which has the impertinence to formulate these
demands contains 16 to the other party’s 37!
Nothing was said about the views of the voters
in rural constituencies won by U.A.P. candi-
dates at the last Federal elections owing to
the pre-election pact which precluded opposition
from the Country party. Both parties have
had their views on the existence or otherwise
of this pact placed prominently before
“S.M.H.’s” readers, but the fact remains that
for some mysterious reason the Country party
did not contest these seats. And nothing was
said about the views of the supporters of
some of the U.A.P. members in the Reps, and
the Senate. A glance at the division lists in
“Hansard” will reveal, for instance, that Har-
rison, of Woollahra, and Lawson, of Mac-
quarie, did not always join in the game of
“follow my leader.”
The “S.M.H.” asked: “Are Dr. Page and
his followers so blinded by political pique or
other sight-destroying influences that they can-
not see what would follow if the threat to run
candidates against Government men for all
country seats was carried out?” What about
Bligh-street’s eyesight? Only the other day,
amid a fanfare of tin-whistles, Dr. Nott was
endorsed as candidate for Calare, a seat
wrested by the Country party from Labor at
the last elections. And the U.A.P. has an-
nounced its intention of splitting votes in other
seats at present held by the Country party, in-
cluding Cowper, which at present returns Page!

Votes for Children.
“J. 8.”: Democracy nowadays has many
critics, but till recently no one has pointed
out the weakness of a system which,
though based on the principle that all men
(and women) are equal, at the polling-
booth if nowhere else, has denied the
franchise to children, who, after all, live
in the same country, breathe the same air
(though in lesser quantities) and suffer
from the same misgovernment as their
elders.
This era has almost ended. No longer
will it be sufficient for Parliamentary can-
didates to woo the votes of impression-
able mothers by kissing babies in arms
and distributing bull’s-eyes among those
who can walk. Henceforth our children
will themselves cast their votes on equal
terms with their parents.
It was left to Mr. Lang to strike the
first brave blow for the youth of this
fair land. Though not explicitly men-
tioned on his platform, it is understood
that his Child Suffrage Bill will be one
of the first measures to be brought be-
fore the House after next November’s
revolution.
It will provide for universal suffrage
for all Australians over the age of six
months who can say in any dialect “Lang
is Right.” Children under this age will
be permitted to cast their suffrages by
proxy if it can be proved that both
parents have voted the solid party ticket
for the three preceding elections. Special
provisions will be made for nursing
mothers, pluralities and triplets.
No trouble will be spared to simplify
the technique of voting. If —as seems
likely—Uncle Jock’s Easter conference
resolution is adopted in toto, separate
polling booths will be provided for the
little ones, surrounded by playgrounds,
and with State nursemaids in attendance.
Each child on entering the booth will
be handed a pretty voting paper, gaily
ornamented with dogs, puss-cats, etc.,
and already filled in. All the young elec-
tor will have to do will be to'place it in
the ballot-box. And so back to the swing
or see-saw, proudly conscious that,
however small, he or she has played a
worthy part in the life of this great
country.
Any little elector who tires of the
State-provided games is at liberty to join
the merry crowd around Nursie from
Goulburn-street. Nursie will entertain
the bairns with stories —not untrue,
wicked, capitalistic fairy tales, but true
stories. She will explain that kind Mr.
Lang, far from being the Big Bad Wolf
who shut up the money-box in Martin-
place, is really the Children’s Friend;
their loving uncle, who is going to abol-
ish homework and provide free sweets
and swings for all. She will probably not
trouble to mention that what he loses on
the swings he will However....
She will warn the children very, very
gravely not to listen to counter-offers
from the Opposition. “Them U.A.P.
swings,” she will say, shaking a minatory
forefinger, “may seem better than ours,
but they’re not. Ours is the only genuine
article guaranteed to swing and swing
and swing, entirely free of charge, for
ever! Don’t let ’em fool you, dearies.”
Her advice will probably be unneces-
sary. Children are often less easy to
fool than grown-ups.


SOCIETY
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Sixenate”: It is not unusual for
Sydney Children’s Court officials to
hear an aggrieved wife frankly admit-
ting that she would like to see her
erring lord “out at Long Bay.” But the
fond hopes of one lady went further. A
constant visitor, each time she came to
complain about a warrant being with-
drawn or time given the bla’guard
to pay up, she predicted that she would
yet see her husband working hard on
the railway tracks ; and “do him good it
would, too.” A puzzled official told her
at last that maintenance prisoners are
put to work inside the place of deten-
tion, never on the railway tracks. “Oh,
“So the editor rejected your offer to
marry his daughter?”
‘Yes —without even the usual thanks for
submitting myself."
ain’t they?” she retorted incredulously.
“What do they call ’em maintenance
gangs for, then?”

“Postume”: The life of the late
Josiah Symon covered a long stretch of
Australian political and legal history—
he was a Minister of the Crown when
Lyons and Page were still in short
clothes and before Bruce was born. And
even at the remote date when he was
sworn in as Attorney-General of the
Morgan Ministry in S. Aus. —March,
1881 —the young lawyer of 34 was
already a Q.C. His term of office on
that occasion was a bare three months,
and he never Held it again in a S. Aus.
Government, but 23 years later he was
an Attorney-General once more, this
time of the Commonwealth. There are
still three Australian octogenarians whose
Parliamentary service began over 50
years ago, though not quite as far back
as Symon’s. Albert Gould and Bruce
Smith first entered the N.S.W. Assembly
in 1882, and Edward Wittenoom was in
the old Westralian Legislative Council
in 1883.

“Kusinjak”: That custom of calling
for drinks by glass names instead of
measures is a profitable one for the pub-
lican. Broken Hill miners saw the tops
of the containers sliding down, the
bottoms rising, and the sides coming in.
They didn’t haggle about prices, but they
did insist on standard weights—stamped
Imperial pint and half-pint measures.
After a beer strike Bung got the
measures, but custom proved too strong
and calls were still made for the pot or
handle, long ’un, schooners and suchlike,
the measured half-pint being forgotten.
But when the miner calls for a “pint”
the publican knows it must be a pint
served in a stamped Imperial pint
measure.

“Oxmead”: After describing Mrs.
Douglas Sladen as “a gifted writer who
has a romantic family connection with
Australia,” Gwen Morton Spencer
(London) is permitted to continue in the
“Sydney Morning Herald” —of all
papers!
Mr. Douglas Sladen is an Englishman,
who has never visited Australia. Nothing
unusual about that, peVhaps.
Except that Sladen was once Professor
of History in Sydney University. But
for that it is supremely unlikely that
Adam Lindsay Gordon would ever have
had his merited niche in the Poets’
Corner of Westminster Abbey. Sladen’s
first wife, the mother of his only son,
was an Australian.

“Crazy Horse”: The Hollywood "talkie
showing General Custer arriving at
a gathering of “very early Californian
settlers” and being staggered to find they
had never heard of the Civil War or of
Grant or Lincoln (B. 4/4/’34) must be
“champion,” as they say i’ Lancashire,
even for Hollywood. California was
“settled” by some hundreds of thousands
of Yankees and others by 1861, when
the Civil War began. Though the rail
had not come through, the coaches and
the famous “pony post” maintained con-
stant communication with the East. Its
isolation kept California out of the fight-
ing, but the State helped the Union in
every other way. Further, it is doubtful
if Custer ever saw California. In the
detailed story of his life by his wife—
who died only recently—there is no men-
tion of his going so far west. Apart
from the Civil War, all his service seems
to have been against the Indians on the
central prairies up to his death at the
hands of the Sioux in Wyoming in 1876.

“Bayete”: There is more than a touch
of tragedy in the English press announce-
ment that “Leslie” Lobenguela, grandson
of the last paramount chief of the Mata-
bele, is working as a car-minder in Man-
chester. This inheritor of the title “Lord
of Ten Thousand Spears” was born in
England, whither his father was taken
after what Kipling wrote of as “our little
account with Loben” had been settled
by the Chartered Company. To old
South Africans the irony of it all will
be emphasised by the fact that the grand-
son of the “Earthshaker” and the great-
grandson of the terrible Moselikatse,
“Maker of the Pathway of Blood” and
founder of the Matabele nation, should
meekly submit to a name like Leslie.

“Bullock Bell”: In a survey camp
back of Gladstone (Q.) my mate and I
swapped war yarns till late in the night,
and between us mopped up numerous
Germans and Turks. I could not sleep,
and in the moonlight, with my tent door
wide open, my old keenness of the listen-
DUDE: “Apple charlotte, please?”
DAD: “Plumduff’ll do me, Charlotte .”
ing post came back, and I heard a dingo
prowling round. I reached for my shot-
gun and fired as he crossed the opening
of my tent, hitting the dog, the buckets
and a sheet of galvanised iron at the
galley. My comrade jumped up, yelled
out “Retire!” and darted through the
back of our tent, half-stunning himself
on the upright. He told me afterwards
he had dreamt that after an all-night
fight the Turks had broken through and
bombed his regiment out of the trenches,
and he was just mounting his horse when
he woke after hitting the pole. I could
only warn him never to sleep on the
back verandah of a two-storey pub.

“Sailor”: Captain Corner, R.N.R., the
one-time skipper of the old windbag
Macquarie, found his sailing experience
very handy when the s.s. Norfolk, which
he was commanding, kicked off her screw
in mid-Indian Ocean. She had left Dur-
ban for Albany with a freezer cargo, and
when about 800 miles
off the W.A. coast a
spell of dirty weather
did the damage. The
Norfolk is a great
butterbox of a cargo-
liner of 5310 tons, and
as soon as she lost her
steering-way she imme-
diately broached-to and
lay suffering in the
heavy seas. The skip-
per put all hands turn-
ing awnings, hatch-
covers and any tar-
paulins into the sem-
blance of sails. It was
a truly remarkable rig,
and, with her stumpy
pole-masts and big,
high hull, it’s a wonder she moved, but
she did better and showed that she could
sail up to the wind and corne-about like
a Yankee moonraker. Corner sailed his
queer command right into the Fremantle
Roads.

“Jobber”: Kit inspection, is it (B.
28 /3 / ’34)? With ten minutes’ warning
I am proud to say that I can turn out on
parade, properly dressed, medals and all
—only the latter are regarded as tripe.
The average Digger, the one who keeps
his uniform and is proud of it, has little
pride in medals. I get a great thrill
when I look at the old hat, issued in
1914, which saw service at Anzac. My
peace-time C.O. has once or twice timidly
suggested that I should scrap the article
on account of its smelliness, but I
wouldn’t part with it for anything. I
have a British “warm,” souvenired on the
other side, which has been a great com-
fort to me in this cold climate. Every
fine Sunday morning all my war-time
clobber goes out on the clothes-line, and
so far the moths have given it a miss.

“Top-rail”: Decoy animals are used
in other places besides slaughteryards
and shearing-sheds (B. 28/3/’34). In the
dense tropical scrub country of the N.Q.
coastal belt it is not an un-
common thing for a quiet,
dependable mare to be
turned out on country
on which brumbies
are running, and she can
usually be relied upon to
coach them out of the scrub
to where (hey can be mus-
tered. And more than once
I have seen a small herd of
quiet cattle, turned out on country im-
possible for stockmen, bring a mob of
scrubbers back with them at the end of
a week. It is strange that the best
coachers never seem to feel the call of
the wild.

“Findy”: Since 1914 S. Aus. has had
none but soldier-Governors; Major-
General Winston Dugan is the latest.
Military or naval service was a passport
for the job in the colony’s early days.
Hindmarsh, a veteran of the Nile and
Trafalgar, was followed by Gawler, who
had won distinction at Badajoz and
Waterloo. Then came Grey and Robe,
both military men, before the first civilian
Governor, Young, arrived in 1848. It
was 21 years before the next soldier ap-
peared—Sir James Fergusson, who had
been through the Crimea; another
military man was Governor Jervois
(1877-1883). Sir Henry Galway, who
came in 1914, had seen service in Nigeria
and other parts of Africa ; his successor,
Colonel Sir Archibald Weigall, was a
home-service warrior, but General Sir
Tom Bridges left a leg and earned a
C.B. and a C.M.G. in Flanders, and the
departing Governor, Brigadier-General
Sir A. Hof e-Ruth ven, is a V.C.

“Selwood”: Have read several pars,
about a brilliant Sydney lawyer and lec-
turer and economist (one R. W. G.
Mackay) who left the Harbor City the
other day to “enter British politics” as
a Labor stalwart. It sounded as if he
had a seat in the House of Commons
waiting for him ; nevertheless, I doubt if
my near-home town of Frome (Somer-
set) is quite that sort of place. In most
respects it is a typical agricultural con-
stituency, except for a dash of collieries
at one end. The Frome division has only
had one Labor member, who won the
seat in 1923 and held it for a year, and
came back again on the Ramsay Mac.
wave of enthusiasm in 1929 for another
two years. At the last elections he went

OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Where is Jardine? Since he left Mysore after
shooting a tiger, he has not been heard of, but it
is rumored that he is on his way to Somaliland.”
Herr Hitler daily in the flesh is seen
And nightly Greta Garbo on the screen;
We know the whereabouts of Bernard Shaw,
But where the blith’ring blazes is Jardine?
Where has he vanished to and whither flown
When the fierce light that beats upon a throne
Gives him less notice than Stavisky gets
Coffined, or in his prison cell Capone?
Dumb as an oyster, voiceless as a clam,
He fades away from all the Aim and flam
That raged around him, like some old-time
craft
Scheduled as “bound in ballast for Guam.”
He who the Ashes from Australia bore,
And cooked a tiger’s goose in far Mysore,
Will he be sine die lost to Lord’s?
The Oval ring to his acclaim no more?
He fades away and leaves nor clue nor sign
While wordy critics still the difi. define
’Twixt pure mischance and sinister intent,
To wit, leg-theory and bodyline.
Belike he stalks the lion to its lair '
Where barrackers are none to bleat and blare.
Where has he gone? Tis little use to ask
When parrot Echo merely answers “Where?”
We know the place where banished Trotsky
lurks,
And where Kerensky does his daily jerks;
We followed Samuel Insull’s hectic course
Until he came to grief among the Turks.
We glimpse the Kaiser in his Doom demesne;
We learn wherever Mussolini’s been;
We’re wise to even Larwood’s habitat;
But where the blith’ring blazes is Jardine?

“F.S.”: Art, as usual, will be the
Cinderella at the centenary banquet in
Melbourne. Total costs are estimated at
£79,350. The air race absorbs £5OOO,
celebrities £5OOO, publicity £14,000, deco-
rations £9750, music £5OOO and pageantry
£lO,OOO. The art exhibition will run
away with a mere £l5OO, and the com-
mittee blithely remarks that it hopes to
get some of that back in revenue. And
yet it can definitely be said that the one
thing about Melbourne which may give
it some claim to uniqueness is its tradition
of art eminence and the! remarkable
present vigor of its art movements. In-
cidentally, the committee nearly forgot
the painters altogether. It was only at
the eleventh hour that somebody referred
to their existence.

“Mrs. Gamp”: “D.E.” (B. 21/3/’34)
is unduly sceptical about the possibility
“How will you word the press notice of your husband’s death?”
“Just ‘Died from a Bullet Inserted by His Loving Wife.’”
of twins having separate fathers. Quite
recently a Swedish Court decided, on
blood-test evidence, that a man sued for
maintenance of twins was assuredly the
father of one but not of the other. There
are two classes of twins, binovular and
uniovular. In the former case they are
the result of the usually simultaneous
fertilisation of two separate and distinct
ova, which develop together, each enclosed
in a separate sac. The sex of the infants
may or may not be the same. Uniovular
twins result from the fertilisation of a
single ovum containing two germinal
vesicles; they are always of like
sex. In the case of binovular twins
a double conception, each taking place
at a different time, is quite possible. The
Scottish case mentioned by “D.E.” is
nothing out of the way, as there are
cases on record of as many as three
months having intervened between the
births of twin infants.

“Exdig”: The most withering remark
I remember about the military police (B.
21 /3 / ’34) was made by a battle-scarred
Digger who was thrown into the clink at
Warwick-square, charged with, amongst
other offences, assault-
ing one of them. It
was hinted that he
was of a quarrelsome
nature; but he
averred that during
his three years in the
A.I.F. he had never stoushed another
man. His record was produced, showing
convictions for five assaults. “But they
wasn’t men,” he objected ; “they was
military policemen.”
* * * *
“Jerry”: I picked up an old “Penny
Magazine,” one of Cassell’s publications
of the early ’nineties, and found this
reference to the Victorian capital: “Mel-
bourne, which consisted of 13 huts and
was known as ‘Bear-grass’ at the time of
Queen Victoria’s accession, is now
classed as the seventh city of the British
Empire.” The name “Bear-grass” is new
to me. Can anyone elucidate it?
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: I am strongly opposed
to the suggestion of the “Age” that the
ancient democratic flavor should be re-
stored to Flemington specially for the
Centenary Cup by allowing the general
public to mingle with members in the
members’ enclosure. It seems to me as
ridiculous a proposal as that visitors
should mingle with the animals at the
Zoo or that the audience should be
allowed to invade the stage during the
performance of a musical comedy. When
the new stand was constructed the strip
of grass in front of it was converted into
a private pen or exercise yard for mem-
bers. As a majority of male members
affect the regulation undertakers’ uni-
form regarded as appropriate for a
national horse festival, the enclosure
forms the most distinctive feature of
Flemington. It appears to be populated
by a single species of fauna, showing,
however, despite a general similarity of
function, diversities of structure, indivi-
dual eccentricities of behavior and
attempts, apparently, at adaptation which
are of the utmost interest to the student,
and a profound puzzle, also. How, for
instance, are we to account for the fact
that some members of the family have
grown upwards and others outwards?
Which variety is more likely to survive
in the struggle for existence, which, in
this case, includes the struggle to get into
a standardised design of motor-car?
Apart from the entertainment value of
the spectacle, these are questions that
are never likely to be decided if the
“Age’s” proposal is adopted and the hoi
polloi are allowed to swarm over the
members.
“How did it happen?”
“I saw an opening between the cars, and when I got up it wasn't there.”
“Sea Lawyer”: The suggestion that the
Yankee absconder Insull might have
evaded extradition by remaining per-
manently at sea (B. 4/4/’34) will not hold
water. It is true that an extradition war-
rant must be addressed to the Courts of
some nation, but the law, like trade, fol-
lows the flag. For instance, on a Greek
ship a wanted man would be on Greek
territory and could certainly be held for
return to Greece, if so desired. Even
that would not be necessary. A Greek
warship or even a properly authorised
merchant vessel could hold up a Greek
ship and remove without warrant anyone
desired for any reason. The same applies
to the ships of any nation.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The question as to which
were the finest performers of the Allied
troops in the last war is one never likely
to be settled. As an Australian who has
seen Canadians, South Africans, Maori-
landers, Indians and British soldiers in
action, I am not at all inclined to sub-
scribe to the theory, popular in this coun-
try, that the Diggers dominated them all.
Professor Ewald Banse, whose book
“Raum und Valk im Weltkrieg” has been
suppressed in Germany, following on a
vain attempt to squelch the publication
of an English translation, “Germany Pre-
pares for War,” may be considered an
unbiassed critic. Ele says: “The indi-
vidual English soldier... .shows the same
steady, if slow, determination. In the
hundred days’ battle in Flanders in the
summer of 1917 he was the mainstay of
the Allies, who were beginning to weaken
under the combined strain of the Russian
collapse, the mutiny in the French army,
the failure of Italy and the fury of the
unrestricted U-boat warfare.” Scots
especially will grumble at the use of the
word “English” instead of “British,” but
otherwise the tribute is a deserved one.
* * * *
“Tut-Tut”: The lines from T. S. Eliot
which “S.T.S.” quotes with a palpable
sneer are nevertheless deliberate in pur-
pose and decidedly pointed and perti-
nent in their context. And as for
“S.T.S.’s” other references —well, typists
are seduced, even as the conventional
heroines of Tennysonian taste: people
do go behind the gasworks to fish, and
poetry is concerned with life as a whole
and not exclusively with roses, baa-
lambs and daisy chains. It is the emi-
nent virtue of the modern movement that
it rejects the shabby conventions of the
pretty-pretty schools, and insists on fac-
ing life as it is. Typists and gasworks
are as familiar in our deplorable land-
scape as shepherds and beeches (and
pimps and tapsters and Doll Tearsheets)
were in Shakspeare’s. Shakspeare inter-
preted the life of his day ; Eliot inter-
prets the life of ours, and he expresses
it wiih extraordinary skill, even in its
inanity and meaninglessness. When a
man with Eliot’s command of words and
exquisite sensibilities produces odd or
difficult verse, we need not immediately
accuse him of wantonness or incompet-
ence or literary sabotage ; because the
meaning happens to be beyond us, we
need not assume that there is no
meaning.
* * * *
“Waalfisch”: Malcolm Campbell, who
occasionally gives up risking his neck in
establishing speed records to prospect for
buried treasure—he has had two futile
goes at Cocos Island—has just returned
from a hunt for a fabulously rich gold-
reef alleged to have been discovered by
the Germans in their West African terri-
tory just before the war. The search
took him into the Namib Desert, and
there about the only prospects located
were the thousands of skeletons of
humans scattered over the sandy wastes.
These are all that is left of the Herrero
nation of nomad Hottentot herdsmen
who inhabited West Africa before the
Germans came. Shortly before the Great
War they rebelled against German rule
and gave their overlords a tough job sub-
duing them. Finally the remnant, esti-
mated at some 30,000, were driven north
into the desert, where they perished,
man, woman and child. Campbell’s evi-
dence might be useful when the Germans
next talk about the return of their
colonies.
* * * *
“Olor”: The Westralian secession
movement —or gesture, or feint, or what-
ever you like to call it —has set some of
the bards smiting their lyres and calling
on all and sundry to rend off Federal
fetters. Most of the orators have been
content to represent the Commonwealth
as a crushing, strangling octopus, but the
poets reach out for new metaphors and
figures of speech. In one delightful com-
position which I have before me the
author lets himself go in the following
passionate apostrophe:
O Swan with outflung wings,
Dark as our anger, dash to earth the Vampire
of the Rings.
The Rings, it seems, are the industrial
combines of the Eastern States. The
picture of the black swan (an essentially
peaceful fowl) advancing menacingly on
the Canberra vampire and preparing to
knock the stuffing out of it must be a
trifle embarrassing to Westralian legis-
lators in comfortable Federal jobs, .like
George Pearce and Paddy Lynch.
* * * *
“Kerys”: The out-of-work Digger
reckoned himself lucky to get a job
travelling round the backblocks to push
the sale of an artificial manure. The
remuneration was small until the firm
wrote him requesting him to make a
point of soil deficiency in marketing the
goods. The Digger knew little about
soil and less of science, but he was re-
sourceful. When he found a likely
“prospect” he lured him to his vegetable
patch, collected a tube of earth, dropped
in a small white pill, poured in some
water and explained that in the event of
his soil being deficient the mixture in
the tube would turn red. This it in-
variably did, and the impressed agricul-
turist usually handed in an order for
a bag or two of the remedial manure,
a genuinely good line, which always gave
good results. It was not till years later
that the salesman, now an authority on
artificial manures, disclosed his method.
Nightly he sat in his room at the hotel
with a slice of bread and a bottle of
ink making a supply of pills, red pill
inside, with a white coating to disguise
the color. Contact with water did the
rest.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The judges in the Vic. centenary lyric competi-
tion, after carefully examining the 279 poems sub-
mitted, decided that only ridicule could result
from the use of any of them on such a dignified
occasion.’’
What an infinity of blasted hopes!
I weep for you, my brothers, who essay
With me to struggle up Parnassus’ slopes,
My fellow-weavers of the lilting lay!
Our cake is obviously dough to-day;
Stern judges fault our moods and mock our
modes
And brutally their studied view convey
We’re hopeless at commemorative odes.
We thought—poor, purblind fools!—we knew
the ropes.
Close on three hundred of us anyway,
Potential Herricks, embryonic Popes,
Grabbed at our lyres our prowess to display.
Alack! our minstrelsy has gone astray.
Blunders by stacks they found, false notes in
loads,
Metres in holes and rhymes in disarray
Unfitting for commemorative odes.
Our cherished images, our haunting tropes,
The pleasant fancies that we deemed 0.K.,
They damned incisively for doggerel dopes;
Our wood-notes wild they scorned for asses’
bray.
We’ve gained no kudos and we’ve earned no
pay, .
And back in our disconsolate abodes
We can but rue in bitter, dumb dismay
Our failure at commemorative odes.
Brothers in rhyme (and in misfortune), grey
Are skies in times like these and rough the
roads.
’Tis little use to carp or to inveigh,
Best turn to less imposing subjects, eh?
We’re duffers at commemorative odes!

POLITIICAL POINTS
The British surplus of £31,147,000 was
the biggest for ten years. The 1923-24
twelvemonth closed with a credit balance
of £48,329,000, but in the previous year
there had been a deficit of £101,516,000.
In eight of the 15 post-war years there
have been surpluses, but they have
amounted to considerably less than the
seven deficits.
During the sitting of the secession con-
vention last week the W.A. pre-Federa-
tion flag, which consists of a black swan
on a yellow ground, was flown over the
Perth Town Hall. One of the first acts of
the Secessionists should be to change the
design—a blue duck would be a more
appropriate emblem.
At last week’s U.A.P. Convention
Premier Stevens, who hitherto has
looked largely to socialistic sewerage-
schemes as a medium for wiping out un-
employment, mentioned that “the per-
manent solution of Australia’s chief
problem must come from private enter-
prise.” It must; but it can’t without
drastic taxation cuts and a united and
secure Government.
Victoria has been having more than its
share of by-elections. The one in Gun-
bower, following the death of Angus,
M.L.A., will be the seventh during the
present Parliament. Five were caused by
deaths, one by the elevation of Fair-
bairn to the Federal House and one by
the appointment of Linton to the Agent-
Generalship. There will, of course, be a
fight in Gunbower between the U.A.P.
and the C.P. The latter already has
J. G. Matheson, a local farmer, in the
field, but the U.A.P. can’t afford to lose
another seat in a House in which 35
seats are held by Labor and C.P. to its
29. Particularly as it now has three
members less to call on than at the
beginning of the Parliament.
The favorable Australian trade com-
modity balance for the eight months
ended February—£2B,62l,ooo sterling
(with bullion, £33,447,000) is not far short
of the value of the whole of the imports
for eight months in 1931-32. It is a
healthy sign that, while exports grew
£14,500,000 sterling during the period,
imports actually dwindled. Australia has
had a favorable trade balance each year
during the depression—at the end of
1933-34 her business for four years past
should be on the right side about
£140,000,000 at least in sterling.
Mr. Menzies says there is a discon-
certing drift in Vic. railway revenue, and
that the State deficit for 1933-34 will pro-
bably be much greater than the £BOO,OOO
budgeted for in the Premiers’ Plan. On
the other hand, though Vic. made less
taxation reductions in the 1933-34
Budget, it has kept taxes well below
those of the other large States and below
the Commonwealth average ; £3 14s. sd.
per head was budgeted for this year
against £5 11s. Id. in N.S.W. and £5 3s.
lid. in Queensland, while income- and
unemployment-tax collections are a third
less per head than in the other Eastern
States.
Westralia has a Lotteries Commission
with a Labor M.L.C. as paid chairman.
A Nat. M.L.A. was principal assistant
till he lost his seat. The public
has been told little about the financial
side of the business, and it was reserved
for the Commonwealth Grants Commis-
sion to elicit that the concern has
£28,000-odd socked away. Of distributed
profits, a large proportion has gone to
the Ugly Men’s Association, of which
the Labor M.L.C. and the former Nat.
M.L.A. were founders. Incidentally, the
Labor M.L.C. has been adjudged by the
Supreme Court to have accepted an office
of profit under the Crown while a
member.
A feature of depression finance is the
way Governments have taken it out
of old people dependent on income from
property. In cases where State mora-
torium and tenant-relief legislation has
not dried up the sources of income, these
veterans’ interest and rent have been
savagely taxed. Particularly by the Com-
monwealth, which has taken as much
as 10 p.c. of it as a special tax, in addi-
tion to imposing much higher rates on
property income than on personal earn-
ings. Britain is much more considerate.
Not only does it make no difference be-
tween earned and unearned income, but
Where a taxpayer or his wife living with
him has attained 65 years, and their total
income does not exceed £5OO, an allow-
ance of tax upon one-fifth of all their in-
come is made.
There are other allowances as well, all
intended to encourage people to put
something by for their old age, instead
of punishing them for doing it as in
Australia.
“Absent friends” will soon be a regular
toast at Queensland Cabinet meetings—
EARLE PAGE : “Heavens, what a partner!”
if any Ministers are at home to drink it.
Just now, Forgan Smith is en route (with
retinue) to London, Bulcock is in Mel-
bourne talking agriculture, Bruce, the
Works Minister, is investigating road
matters in M.L., Cooper, the education-
ist, and Dash (Transport) are in Sydney,
and Jimmy Stopford, the restless Mines
Minister, has “been in Victoria on de-
partmental business for some weeks.” It
is almost like the good old Ryan days,
when Southport, Brisbane’s fashionable
seaside resort, used to boast that it had
been more inspected by Ministers than
any place on earth.
Prince George will enjoy his first
diversion immediately on arrival at Port
Melbourne. He is to be diverted from
the direct route to the metropolis and
sent on a tour of the foreshore to St.
Kilda. The design is to allay possible
jealousy between the municipalities.
Port Melbourne will be diverted with
a new concrete road, and the Prince with
some new gardens and a converted
swamp, if the job can be finished in time.
Few will agree with Premier Stevens’s
claim at the N. S. Wales U.A.P. con-
vention that “the increasing enterprise
and employment in this State have in
large part followed the reconstitution of
the Legislative Council,” which he calls
a strong, efficient second Chamber cal-
culated to raise the dignity of Parliament
and public life.
The sorry expedient born in an atmo-
sphere of vote-buying, informal voting
and recriminations has a very long way
to go before the public begins to view
it with respect, much less as a justifica-
tion for starting fresh N. S. Wales indus-
tries.
Premier Collier is arranging for a
special session of his Parliament to
obljge the secessionists. He is just back
in Perth from Sydney, where he attended
a conference designed to unite the Labor
factions on a programme which aims at
unification and abolition of the Senate.
He came to Sydney from Melbourne,
where he attended a meeting of Premiers
and tried to get an increase on his special
grant of £600,000 from the Common-
wealth. A singularly accommodating
politician this.
The descent of the Beasley-Langsters
on Queensland has been about as palat-
able with the local Labor panjandrums
as an infusion of petrol in their break-
fast tea. Forgan Smith, for example, by
way of a parting benediction, asked
Queensland Labor to note the effect of
the Lang policy on N.S.W., especially in
regard to the State Savings Bank, while
J. C. Lamont, leader of the Queensland
A.W.U., advised the “disrupters” from
N.S.W. to try to put their own house
in order before starting a spring cleaning
in Queensland.
While the Government Statistician’s
figures show that departures from the
Commonwealth last year exceeded
arrivals by 1472, there was a net gain of
Europeans other than British of 816;
of Maorilanders of 514, and of N. and S.
Americans of 146. The net decline was
made up almost wholly of British sub-
jects, leavened with 179 Asiatics. The
figures are not big, but the nature of
the drift is not comforting to a people
which prides itself on having 98 p.c.
British stock. Australia gained about
730 southern Europeans in 1933.
Governments have strange ideas of
economy in little things. The “S. M.
Herald” carries a relief-work advertise-'
ment from the Stevens Government
which could be compressed to read
thus:
Registered Relief Workers to Report as
Follows on April 9:
Annandale Depot.—Men with dependants,
815,001 to B 40,000; single men, A 30,001 to
A 93,000, residing in Annandale District, 10.30
a.m.
St. Peters Depot.—Men with dependants,
D 1 to D 10,000, and single men, C 20.001 to
C 49.000, residing in St. Peters District, 10.30
a.m.
City of Sydney, 132 George Street North. —
Men with dependants, etc., residing in Sydney
City, and experienced stonemasons residing in
Sydney City.
Kogarah Labor-Exchange.—Builders’ laborers,
9 a.m.
But the Government version runs to 37
lines at Is. a line!
Home Secretary Hanlon proposes to
allocate some of Q.’s Casket money to
winter relief for the unemployed, there
being more than enough in hand and in
sight to meet present commitments for
State institutions. The proceeds of one
of the big lotteries —about £25,000 —will
be handed to the Labor Department.
Last year winter relief came to £9OOO.
So the extra cash, besides helping out
many needy families, should spell extra
jobs for out-of-works in woollen mills
and boot factories.
Forgan Smith is on his way to Eng-
land to handle the sugar situation and
settle some other problems. It may
end his immediate chance of leading a
solidified Federal Labor party. Taking
one thing with another, he looks to be
due for a long rest rather than a bigger
job.
Allegations that the members of
Roosevelt’s Brain Trust are deliberately
retarding the recovery of business in
U.S.A. in order to drive the nation into
Communism suggest that any stick is
good enough to beat a dog with. It is
difficult to believe that the collection of
professors and what not have any clear
idea of where they want to get to. That
their advice may eventually land the
country in Communism is possible, but
if it does nobody will be more hurt and
surprised than they will be.
The list of unity conferences is being
added to by 13 S.A. unions, which
have asked the four Labor “parties”
hanging round Adelaide to send six dele-
gates apiece—to discuss with the con-
veners whether they should continue to
cumber the ground. Some of the “par-
ties” will be hard put to it to dig up six
delegates.
A new U.S. ambassador arriving at
Dublin was received not by the Governor-
General—a retired draper or something,
unknown outside Dublin—but by De
Valera. Perhaps by way of explaining
this departure from custom, Minister
O’Kelly declared that “something should
be done every day to cut the chains
which England has wound round the Irish
people,” instancing with satisfaction the
removal of the oath of allegiance to “a
foreign king.” Incidentally, the subjects
of the “foreign king” have hitherto sent
millions across the Irish Sea for the
sweeps which are now the Free State's
main industry. His brutal Ministers are
putting the sweeps under a ban so severe
that even buyers of lottery tickets will be
subject to heavy fines for a first offence
and imprisonment for a second.
J. Bull gave beer-drinkers the benefit
of a substantial reduction of duty last
year. The price over the bar counter
came down a penny a pint, and on paper
revenue should have dropped £14,000,000;
but it did not work out that way. Bold
cuts in taxes on necessaries never do. If
Lyons and co. had followed the British
example, the toiler would have appre-
ciated it, and revenue would not have
suffered. But they were too niggardly
or too timid, so although the man who
drinks beer gets a dash more in a six-
penny glass he still has to pay 9d. a
pint on the coast, and more inland. The
marvel is that he stands it.

Like Justice Macfarlan, Victoria’s new
Supreme Court Judge, Russell Martin, is
an Old Wesleyan. He was severely
wounded in the World War. His prestige
as an advocate, especially in common law
and taxation cases, grew rapidly, and he
twice went to England as junior counsel
in Bawra litigation before the Privy
Council. On the last occasion he
appeared with Sir John Simon. At 45
he is Victoria’s youngest Judge.
“O.”: William Anderson isn’t the only
veteran living in Australia.
William Bailey, of Boggabri (N.S.W.),
locally known as John Brown, is another.
He is still going strong at 97. After the
Crimea, William was drafted for active
service to the Maori war, but decided to
stay in Australia. Until a few years ago
he could work as hard as the next man,
and he was a gun shearer with the blades

years and three months, started there
60 years ago as a scholar. Over 1000
pupils have passed through her hands. She
has been under six masters, and for many
years received the princely salary of £l6
per year paid in quarterly instalments.
Scotland can claim Jim Jelley if so
inclined, but' S.A. has had his services
for most of his life. A cabinet-maker
by trade, he was elected to the Council
as a Laborite in 1912, and stayed there
till ’33. He was Chief Secretary in the
Gunn Government, 1924-27, and looked

after Local Government, Immigration,
Repat. and Irrigation for Hill. He had
a row with his leader and resigned his
portfolios early last year, and didn’t con-
test his seat in the March elections.
Always a racing enthusiast, he was
appointed chairman of the Betting
Board last December, when S.A. brought
the bookies back from their 40 years in
the wilderness.
About a clerical sportsman:
Father King, C.M., who has become presi-
dent of St. Stanislaus, Bathurst, was nearly
a first-class cricketer in his prime. He learned
the game from Victor Trumper. He knows
all about football, too. The school teams
that he put in the Bathurst district competi-
tions were always good, and one got away
with the comp, in 1919, four of the players
going on to inter-State honors. His reverence
has now taken to golf, and is no mean per-
former. Incidentally, his school has a unique
record All its masters are ex-students, and
Father King is the third president who was
both ex-student and ex-master.
Rear-Admiral Ford, who will take
over command of the R.A.N. next week,
was in Australia at the beginning of the
century on the Pioneer. He was at Anzac
during the war, commanded the Royal
Oak in the Mediterranean Squadron, and
later had charge of the Portsmouth Navi-
gation School. Though not Australian-
born, like Rear-Admiral Dalglish, whom
he is succeeding, he has met a good
many R.A.N. ranks and ratings, and he
likes and respects them. His political
creed may be stated in a phrase: Empire
defence, and plenty of it.
Dr. Lee Brown, the Sydney urologist
and A-grade golfer, was in the prime of
life (a few days short of 39) when he was
killed in a ’plane smash last week. His
father, a Quarantine doctor, was
drowned in the Greycliffe disaster,
and his father-in-law, Dr. Gordon Craig,
was M.O. in charge of a hospital ship
during the war. He graduated at Sydney
Uni., worked in London and San Fran-
cisco (where he married) and went into
partnership with his father-in-law in
Macquarie-street afterwards. He had
great ability, a tremendous capacity for
taking pains and a charming manner
and nature. He was an efficient pilot—
indeed, he was phenomenally efficient at
everything calling for the use of his
hands. The accident was due to the
’plane, which he was demonstrating to a
friend, getting into a tail-spin.
Hector Bolitho, of Auckland (M.L.),
is one of the many journalists who
crossed the Tasman and made good in
Sydney. E. G. Knox —who, as editor
of the murdered “Evening News,” dis-
closed a wonderful eye for a writer —
made him that paper’s literary editor,
but he soon left for London. He re-
turned by the Strathaird last week on a
visit to his birthplate. Since leaving this
part of the world he has published
several novels, but his name and fame
rest on his biographies of important
people. “Albert the Good” had the cor-
rect note, and was a best-seller in right-
thinking circles, and he recently finished
“Victoria, the Widow and Her Son.”
Descending somewhat in the social scale,
he wrote “Alfred Mond: First Baron
Melchett,” and he has just been commis-
sioned to deal with the late Lord Inch-
cape’s career in the same spirit of almost
mystical reverence. He belongs to the
Athenaeum, a sure haven for biographers
and bishops, but one in which neither
G. B. Shaw, Wells, Somerset Maugham
nor Noel Coward could hope to find
refuge.
“Jeames” on expatriates:
Captain Briscoe, M.P., who is in Australia
on business, belongs to one of those families
whose offshoots have almost forgotten their
Australian affiliations. Most of them come
from Victoria and settle in England; there
are a few in Scotland and a handful
in France —chiefly on the Riviera. The Wil-
sons, of Melbourne, were well and truly
Anglicised 30 years ago; one of them went
into the Guards and married Lady Sarah
Churchill, daughter of a Duke of Marlborough.
There are Clarkes, Osbornes, Binnies, Par-
burys, Horsfalls and Maddens in London and
thereabouts who will never see Australia again.
About half the members of the Fairfax (“S. M.
Herald”) family are completely Anglicised, so
are all the Frazers, descendants of old John
Frazer, of the great Sydney softgoods firm.
Most of Captain Briscoe’s income derives from
Briscoe and Co., of Australia and M.L. He
served with the Guards in the war, got an
M.C., and became a Unionist M.P. in 1923.
The family place is Longstowe Hall, near
Cambridge.
Thomas Tate, who recently died at
Rockhampton (Q.), had a stirring life.
Born at Alnwick (Northumberland)
93 years ago, he started with a
trip "to the Arctic regions. In N. S.
Wales he went gold-seeking. Then he had
charge of hospitals in M.L. and Vic-
toria. In Victoria he joined those who
chartered the brig Mana, which started
for New Guinea and was wrecked off
the Queensland coast. He next joined
the Hann expedition, which discovered
the first gold in the Palmer district. He
was the doctor, botanist and naturalist of
this expedition, and the Tate River was
called after him.
C. Allen Lewis arrived in Australia
from England in 1912 to push on the
Sydney end of his company’s interests.
As managing director of Concrete Con-
structions and chairman of Lewis Con-
struction (M.L. and South Africa) he

Empire’s greatest cement industries.
has travelled all over Australia, many
miles having been covered on roads built
by his own firm. He is leaving next
month for M.L. (where Lewis Construc-
tion built the 10-storey Prudential build-
ing in Wellington) and S. Africa, which
possesses samples of his craft in Jo’burg,
Durban and elsewhere. “Concrete”
Lewis The Bulletin christened him
years ago, and the nickname has stuck.
When not thinking and talking cement
and forming new cement companies,
“Concrete” plays golf—chiefly at Royal
Sydney—and confers with Joe Wallis
about his physical condition. He likes
Joe, but never means to have his kind
of figure.
Otto Kahn, the international financier,
never demonstrated his power more spec-
tacularly than in the case of Nijinsky,
of the Imperial Russian Ballet. The
war caught Nijinsky in Vienna, and he
was interned. The Czar offered to ex-
change some Austrian prisoners for
Russia’s greatest dancer. The Austrian
Government valued Nijinsky at six high
officers, including the general who de-
fended Przmsyzl. This was too much
for the Czar, and he appealed to the good
offices of neutrals. The Pope, King
Alphonso and half the crowned heads of
Europe appealed on the prisoner’s
behalf. Then Nijinsky was charged with
drawing plans of Austrian fortifications,
which turned out later to be designs for
a new dance movement. One day an
official called and presented him with
an unconditional release and his pass-
port. Pinned to the documents was a
cable from Otto Kahn, chairman of
directors of the Metropolitan Opera
House, offering him handsome terms for
a New York season.
Professor Dunbabin, of the University
of Tasmania, says we have been misled.
Prof. Giblin (B. 21/3/’34) didn’t “traverse
most of Europe on foot”; he only traversed
France and Switzerland. He never saw the
Klondyke; he mined on the Stickeen River in
British Columbia and on a tributary of the
Mackenzie. He didn’t return from the war
with a beard; he went away with one and^ re-
turned clean-shaven. Nor did he enter “the
Speck Parliament” after the war. He resigned
his seat to go to the war. He didn’t get a
“double first-class in maths, at Cambridge.
There is no such thing. He got a second-class.
Lastly he was not Commonwealth Statistician,
but acting C.S.
He is, however, a more versatile man than the
The Bulletin’s informant supposes. when
only seventeen and six months he won a Tas-
manian scholarship of £2OO a year for four
years. Three years later he took his B.Sc. at
London and went up to Cambridge. There he
rowed in his college eight and played Rugby
for Cambridge and for England. On coming
back from Canada he became a schoolmaster
in Hobart. Then he went to the Solomon
Islands to report on a copra property. Some
months later he was in the British Museum
hunting out prints for one of E. V. Lucas s
books. Shortly after he was planting out an
orchard in Tasmania. While he was Tas. Gov-
ernment Statistician, he was the most valued
member of the University Council.
The new captain of H.M.A.S. Can-
berra is a son of Lieutenant-General
Walker, who was Birdwood’s chief-of-
staflf at the Landing, and who afterwards
commanded the First Division, A.I.F.
The son strongly resembles his parent
and shares his nickname of “Hookey.”
The loss of an arm, which was
blown off while he was leading a
landing party from the Vindictive at
Zeebrugge, makes him the most Nel-
sonian-looking officer the R.A.N. has
known. “Hookey,” Senior, sent a charac-
teristic message to his old division by
his offspring: “The work of the Aus-
tralians in saving Hazebrouck, and con-
sequently the channel ports, when the
Germans broke through the Portuguese
front in April, 1918, has never received
the public recognition it deserves.”
Matthew Foggon, Methodist minister,
got a farewell presentation the other day
from the lepers of Peel Island (Q-). He
has toiled among them for many years
as chaplain. Foggon is a little wisp of
a man who, as much as 30 years ago,
looked as if he were on the edge of
Hereafter, but his beard has always
hidden a lot of vitality. His son, who
is about twice his size, was a master at
Newington, and now heads a high
school at Charters Towers.
P. S. Hobday, whose pioneer exhibi-
tion of monotypes and water-colors will
be opened in Sydney’s Academy Salon
to-day, was born with a brush instead of
a silver spoon in his hand. His father
once one of Disraeli’s private secretaries
—was an early president of the Queens-
land Art Society, a position which the
son now has held for four years. P.S.,
who is a delicate colorist, is represented
Queensland Art Society’s president, who
is holding a one-man show in Sydney.
in the Queensland National Gallery, and
his work has been bought by several
Governors and by the Queensland Gov-
ernment. He is president of the Queens-
land Authors and Artists’ Association
and of the Wattle League, and no fellow-
artist who needs a hand ever has to look
far if he is within range.

The spring in the figures—the £70,359
was £12,000-odd in excess of a full year’s
pref. requirements—fitted in with market
anticipations, the prefs. having advanced
from 11s. 6d. to 21s. 6d. over the twelve-
month. But the price dropped to 20s.
9d. following the board’s announcement
that, owing to the extra working capital
required to finance increased produc-
tion, it was unable to begin payments to
the prefs., and will not be able to make
a start in this connection until some time
after May, when the interim div. next
falls due.
There is £3,330,976 of capital calling
for attention in a million 1\ p.c. cum.
prefs. and 2,700,007 ords. —£38,594 was
gathered from the ords. last year, and
there was another £369,031 callable when
the books closed. Incidentally, the ords.,
which are not listed, are held mostly by
the Hoskinses —out of their allotment
(1,446,400 shares) they handed Dorman
Long 396,400 shares and Howard Smith
50,000 shares for coming into the
venture. The statutory cut (22£ p.c.)
has lowered the pref. div. to a shade
over 5.8 p.c. (= £58,000 p.a.) from Oct.
1, 1931. That is to say, at the end of
November next there will be £244,000-
odd (approximately 4s. lid. per share)
coming to them. There is also £91,675
coming to the ords. in respect of a 5 p.c.
div. declared in 1929, but not paid, owing
to the change in outlook. For this
amount the ords. rank as creditors in
the usual sense of the term.
Among other things, the next table
shows how the year’s larger trading was
financed:—

■lncludes ord. div. (£91,675) declared but not paid.
To add £38,169 net to the book value
of fixed assets (plant for the manufac-
ture of high-grade black and galvanised
sheets is being installed) and carry an
extra £107,144 of debtors’ balances, the
board went outside for a further £41,188
and gathered £38,594 of fresh capital.
Excluding arrears of pref. divs. and
shares in other cos. (chiefly scrip in
Southern Portland Cement and Southern
Blue Metal, both disappointments), lia-
bilities exceeded more or less liquids by
£201,432, or £70,784 less than the excess
at the previous balance.
Both the plant and the staff are highly
efficient, and the co. has a very exten-
sive goodwill, of which no account is
taken in the books. Still, these things
don’t mean all that they might unless
production can be maintained at a satis-
factory level. There was a marked in-
crease in output last year, and prospects
of further improvement are encourag-
ing ; yet the plant is capable of doing
vastly more work than is likely to be
required of it for some time.

This well-handled and solidly-established
produce, carrying and agency con-
cern, whose business is well scattered
throughout the back-country in N. S.
Wales, paid divs. averaging approxi-
mately 13 p.c. for the 20 years to the
end of January, 1931. Meanwhile
£45,000 of gift scrip was scattered, a cash
bonus of £25,000 was paid, £55,195 was
brought from hiding and put in the win-
dow, and another £20,000 of inner re-
serves was used to write down the book
value of premises. Then slump gave
earnings a nasty jolt, the call for con-
tingencies grew louder, and for the first
time since 1895 shareholders went with-
out for the six months to the end of
July, 1931.
But the co. was well equipped for a
struggle, and, with the rise in the price
of wool and improvement in the outlook
generally, the figures have responded
nicely. For the 12 months to the close
of last accounts, gross earnings (£99,342)
improved £4768, and exes. (£71,738)
were £4925 lighter, leaving the declared
net result at 20 p.c. on capital as against
13, 5.7, 15, 22.2, 22.1, 25.8, 22.5 and
24 p.c. back to 1926. So the div. was
lifted a couple of points to 12 p.c. for
the second half, making 11 p.c. for the
year as against 9,4, 17 and 20 p.c. for
the four preceding years. The £12,479
that remained after paying the year’s
div. was whisked away to inner reserves.
Visible accumulations are £44,792 in ex-
cess of paid capital; so the two combined
need net only 5.1 p.c. to cover a 12 p.c.
div.
The next table shows how well-ribbed
the co. is financially:

Debtors’ balances is the item which
catches the eye; the figure was reduced
£17,691 last year, making the contraction
£67,356 over the last four years. This
and a reduction of £9lOO in the advance
to McCulloch’s (£16,336 the other
£25,000 is in scrip) enabled £11,277 to
be knocked off the debt, £13,733 to be
added to the cash holding and £2069 to
premises and plant. Including advances
but not shares, the more or less liquid
surplus (£262,260) slipped £941 over the
twelvemonth.
Prospects of the 12 p.c. div. being
maintained, with the possibility of a bit
more later, are bright enough at the
moment. Hence the market prices the
fully-paid 50s. shares at £7 15s. as against
£3 10s. three years ago. At £7 15s. the
return is 3.8 p.c. on a 12 p.c. div. basis,
or 4.6 p.c. on a 14 p.c. distribution. The
cover is £5 16s. 3d. in net tangibles.

This co., which used to quench most of
Wellington’s thirst, is now mainly an
investment concern, whose £350,000 of
capital and £106,526 of reserves are, re-
presented chiefly by freeholds and other
investments, the exact nature of which
is not disclosed. It merged its beer-
making interests, together with eight
others, in N.Z. Breweries in 1923. The
price was £143,017 cash for fixed assets
and stocks plus £57,500 in scrip for
goodwill. The operating co. made a one-
for-two gift scrip issue in 1928. But the
published figures give no clue to the
extent of Staples’s present holding in the
combine; much depends upon the
amount, if any, of the combine’s 10 p.c.
debentures it held. These were con-
verted into pound shares at the rate of
one for each £2 of debenture stock
early in 1930, when the shares com-
manded a premium of 300 p.c. on the
market; they now fetch around 30s.
The brewing co.’s div. fell from 15 p.c.
to 7 p.c. over the three years to the end
of March, 1933.
Because of this, and the drop in ren-
tals and dividends generally, Staples’s
gross earnings have fallen abruptly from
£84,675 for the 12 months of 1929 to
£29,544 last year, when the slip was
£1730. Also, the tax-gatherer takes a
much bigger proportion of earnings than
he used to. Last year’s net result was
3.7 p.c. on capital as against 4.2, 10.6,
13.6 and 15.7 p.c. back to 1929. Still,
the div. was kept at 5 p.c., though visibly
reserves had to be tapped for £4592 to
do it, reducing the lay-by to £106,526.
That excludes the tax reserve (£5700),
down £16,800 during the year.
Here is the position so far as balance-
sheet figures disclose it:
1929. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Paid capital.. £350,000 £350,000 £350,000 £350,000
Creditors .. 3,771 2,487 3,933 2,419
Freeholds .. 147,874 179,798 224,508 219,841
Hotel assets .. 13,387 7,624 6,551 8,349
Investments .. 215,855 229,067 224,067 200,096
Fittings, etc. 221 200 190 180
Debtors . . 91,940 85,225 40,985 40,768
Cash . . 39,742 12,805 4,161
The reduction in the tax reserve may
have some connection with the year’s
contraction of £23,971 in the book value
of investments. Though the board makes
a separate item of “sundry hotel assets,”
freeholds, on which £4667 more was
written off than was spent during the
year, are known to consist largely of
hotel properties.
Now that conditions generally are be-
coming more settled in the Dominion,
the co.’s earnings can be expected to im-
prove. The market therefore prices the
scrip at 275. as against 225. 6d. a year
ago. At the higher figure the return is
3.7 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis, or 4.4 p.c.
on a 6 p.c. distribution. The cover is
265. Id. in net tangibles.

This is one of the holding cos. through
which the public is interested in Carlton
and United Breweries. Of the operating
co.’s 1,950,000 £1 shares, Foster owns
83,049—10,549 prefs. and 72,500 ords.—
which figure at £84,780 (cost). At Dec.
31 other assets were debtors, £4152;
Consols, £9421 ; cash, £963. The invest-
ment possibilities of the scrip are there-
fore governed by results in the operat-
ing co.
For the year to June 30 last C.U.B.
paid 10 p.c. as against 10, 11| and 15
p.c. for the three preceding years, and
17£ p.c. for the three years before that.
Over the same period declared net earn-
ings were 12.2 p.c. on capital as against
12.2, 11.4, 12.3, 17, 21.6 and 22.8 p.c.
Prospects of further improvement are
encouraging. Finances are robust,
and the co. seized the opportunity
which the slump in value of hotel pro-
perties gave it to secure more of the
trade —£282,736 has been added to the
book value of hotel freeholds (£671,832)
over the last four years. Also, according
to the Licensing Court’s figures, the pur-
chase of liquor by Victorian hotels in-
creased 2.4 p.c. during the 12 months
ended March 1 last, though it was still
32 p.c. below the 1929-30 figure. The
percentage of trade-unionists unemployed
in Vic. has fallen from 27.7 for the
second quarter of 1932 to 19.9 for the
last quarter of 1933. Spendinf is a bit
less restricted, real-estate values are
steadier, there has been a 40 p.c. cut in
the special tax on income from property,
and chips have been taken off land and
other taxes.
Last year Foster received £8304 in
divs. and £387 in interest. Exes, took
£721, leaving enough to show 13.8 p.c
on its £57,600 of capital, and the div.
was lowered from 13| p.c. to 12 p.c.
On the basis of last year’s figures an
extra 1 p.c. from the C.U.B. would en-
able Foster to show 15.2 p.c. on its capi-
tal. The market prices the pound shares
at 575. 4d. The return at that figure is
4.2 p.c. on a 12 p.c. div. basis, or 4.8
p.c. on a 14 p.c. distribution.
East African Coffee
It has been a disappointing venture.
Formed in Melbourne in 1928 to grow
coffee in East Africa, the co. took over
some 8500 acres, mostly on a 99-years’
lease, in the Nandi and Kiambu dis-
tricts. Before it could get on its feet the
market broke —the trees are not revenue-
producers until three years old, and do
not come into bearing until their sixth
year—and shareholders, who have lost
half their capital, have had to put up
more to protect the other half.
Accounts for the nine months to the
end of May, 1933, are to be presented
in Melbourne this week, nearly 12
months after the books closed. A much
heavier crop was harvested —126.5 tons
as against 28.3 tons for the previous
season, when heavy pruning affected the
yield—but there was a further sharp
contraction in prices. The top grades,
aggregating 118.25 tons, were sold in
London for an average of £6l 12s. Id.,
which was £8 Bs. less than the previous
season’s average, and £l3 13s. 6d. below
the 1930-31 figure; the other 8.25 tons
averaged £37 9s. 3d. in the local market
at Nairobi. The net result of the year’s
trading was a loss of £941, raising the
p. and 1. debit to £4429. That was after
charging £6721 net to development,
lifting expenditure on this account to
£67,630; preliminary exes, figure at
£3260.
Moreover, the co. was becoming ham-
strung by lack of working capital:
1930. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Paid capital.. £150,000 £150,000 £150,000 £150,000

Cash, etc. .. 1,120 50 49 27
To meet the year’s outlay £3918 was
added to the overdraft (£19,059), £6Bl
to the amount coming to trade creditors
(£2015) and £785 and £567 respectively
to advances from Victoria Nyanza
(£11,055) and from the estate of the late
George Mayers (£12,796). Also the plan-
tation (bought and mostly developed-
while prices were high) and the equip-
ment were not worth their book value.
To knock £37,071 off the land and build-
ings item, £8079 off plant, £22,434 off
development account and wipe out the
p. and 1. debit and preliminary exes.,
half the ord. capital has been jettisoned
since the books closed, reducing the
figure to £75,000. Also, £30,000 of 7
p.c. pref. money has been gathered, mak-
ing paid capital £105,000.
Hopes are that the new Kenya Coffee
Board, set up by ordinance, will help
to stiffen the price and quicken sales.

This co. missed the market, notwith-
standing that it had the blessing of
Howard Smith, Australian Iron and Steel
and Noyes Bros.—between them they
hold most of the £849,889 of capital,
which is in 300,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.,
called to 145., and 639,889 fully-paid £1
ords. It put up a modern plant, capable
of turning out 160,000 tons of cement
annually, at Berrima (N.S.W.), and pro-
duction began in May, 1929. Almost
immediately slump brought a heavy
fall in the demand for cement, and the
works have since had to close down from
time to time as stocks accumulated, and
prices have had to be cut in the struggle
for whatever business was to be had.
Things were a bit better last year, but
the profit was still £3724 short of a full
year’s pref. div. (6.2 p.c., after allowing
for the statutory cut).
The fact is that the industry is heavily
overcapitalised. Thus technical efficiency
and a good sales organisation don’t mean
all they might. The position is worst in
N. S. Wales, where plant capacity is as
follows:
Co. Tons.
Kandos .. .. .. .. 225,000
Commonwealth .. . . 225,000
Southern 160,000
Standard 100,000
Sulphide Oorp. .. . . 80,000
Total 790,000
Either of the two big cos. alone could
have supplied more than the demand for
the whole State in 1932 (155,886 tons).
Capitalising plant at £5 per ton of
capacity, this means that on the average
over £3,000,000 of the capital invested in
the industry was not earning anything
in 1932. The spring in last , year’s sales
for the State is estimated at over 33 p.c.,
and further improvement is expected dur-
ing 1934, thanks to the resumption of
work on the Nepean and Warragamba
dams, the Hume reservoir, silo construc-
tion and improvement in the building
trade generally. Also, R. B. Hinder,
manager of the Cement Manufacturers’
Association, is doing good work in widen-
ing and cheapening the uses of cement.
Financially, Southern Portland is not
particularly well equipped for a struggle:

creditors and add £1221 to debtors’
balances, the book value of fixed assets
and stocks (now lumped in one untidy
entry) was reduced by £29,370.
Tin
At the end of last week the London
spot price of tin made a sharp rise of
55., reaching £243 17s. 6d., the highest
figure touched since February, 1928. The
spring was due chiefly to strong Ameri-
can buying and to continued improve-
ment in the statistical position of the
metal:
r~ March — N
„ , 1932. 1933. 1934.
Production (tons).. 7,028 6,988 6,925
Consumption (tons) 7,221 6,595 7,994
Stocks (tons) . . 50,937 42,948 19,613
Average price ..£129/18/3 £149/4/2 £233/19/2
Thus, while a tight hold has been kept
upon production, consumption has in-
creased and visible stocks (they do not
include carryover in the Straits Settle-
ment, 2126 tons at the end of March)
have been reduced from 50,937 tons at
the end of March, 1932, to 19,613 tons
at the end of last month. Over the same
period the average London price of the
metal advanced steadily from £129 18s.
3d. to £233 19s. 2d., due largely to the
operations of the restriction scheme and
buying support from the U.S.A.
In view of the substantial reduction in
the cost of producing tin, a price of over
£243 per ton has made the metal so pro-
fitable that many are now wondering
whether the figure can remain propped
around that level without endangering
the whole restriction scheme. London
interests, which apparently consider that
the immediate danger is not great, have
recently taken a strong fancy for the
scrip of Australian-controlled Malayan
tin-dredging ventures, some of which
they have bought heavily in the local
market, with a consequent sharp rise in
the price. Speaking generally, London
investors look for a much smaller return
from mining ventures than is expected
locally.
Under the new international agree-
ment, the five signatory countries (Brit-
ish Malaya, Siam, Dutch East Indies,
Bolivia and Nigeria) have decided to con-
tinue control of the production and ex-
port of tin until the end of 1936. Siam’s
export quota remains unchanged at
10,000 tons p.a., until other countries
have increased production to 65 p.c. of
their 1929 outputs. The quota of the
other four has been increased from 33
1-3 p.c. to 40 p.c., plus another 4 p.c. for
1934. But should supplies from other
sources exceed 25 p.c. of the new quota
for six consecutive months, then any
signatory may give six months’ notice of
its intention to withdraw from the
scheme, and the whole thing may be
abandoned. Siam, which is assured of
a market for its tin in Japan, is the
danger spot at the moment.
Mt. Isa, which has thus far been pro-
ducing only silver-lead bullion, has not
yet been able to earn enough to give
shareholders anything, and it is difficult
to say when it will be likely to do
so. The production of zinc, however,
would enable it to lower its mining and
treatment costs; and statistically the out-
look for spelter is the most encouraging
of the base metals. So, to enable the
co. to develop and treat its zinc sul-
phides, the board is negotiating in Mel-
bourne for a £500,000 A\ p.c. loan, re-
payable in 1938, and which will be guar-
anteed as to principal and interest by
the Queensland Government. Should
the average price of metals fall below
their, present levels, or should a sub-
stantial fall in the Australian-London ex-
change rate occur, the co. will have the
right, upon obtaining consent of the
Queensland Government, to discontinue
production so long as the disabilities con-
tinue. Towards the close of last year the
board was considering a scheme for the
production of 80,000 tons of zinc. con-
centrates annually.

Bendigo Mines, Ltd., has been formed in
Melbourne, with powerful local and over-
seas backing, to take over and test leases
covering about 2300 acres, which embrace
some 40 miles of synclines and anti-
clines traversing the Bendigo field. It is
not proposed to unwater old mines, but
to break new ground. Nominal capital
is £600,000 in 10s. shares, of which the
vendor, Exploration Syndicate, N.L.,
takes 40,000 paids, and the underwriters
—Gold Mines of Aust., Metals Investi-
gation Pty., Union Corp. (London), Cen-
tral Mining and Investment Corp. (Lon-
don) and Case, Pomeroy and Co. (New
York) —have taken 300,000 firm. The
160,000 shares available to the public
locally were quickly snapped. Of the
remaining 700,000 shares, a quarter-mil-
lion are under option to the underwriters
for two years at a premium of 2s 6d.
each, and another quarter-million for
four years at a premium of ss. each. A
technical committee, comprising G.
Lindesay Clark, H. E. McKinstry and
J. B. Stone, will advise the co.
On the board are E. C. Dyason (chair-
man), Colin Fraser, Massy Greene, T.
F. Field, G. L. Clark and H. E. Mc-
Kinstry.

The secretary, Australian Roma Oil,
writes in reference to Wallumbilla bore
(A.R.O. XIX), B. 28/3/’34:
The gas emitted was estimated at between
seven million and ten million cubic feet per day.
Samples of the gas taken by the Chief Gov-
ernment Geologist (L. C. Ball) showed that
the ethane (petroliferous) content ranged from
11.5 p.c. to 20 p.c. On these results alone
there is justification for the expectation of a
commercial gas well. It is calculated that a
gas well giving a constant flow of 5,000,000
cubic feet of gas per day, with a petrol con-
tent of three pints per thousand cubic feet,
will enable motor spirit to be sold at Is. per
gallon, and show a net profit of about £9OOO
per annum. The bore penetrated five zones
of gas and oil sands, aggregating approximately
70 feet, all of which showed crude oil by
laboratory test. Also it has shown a deepening
of the sedimentary strata eastwards from Roma,
and has demonstrated that it is in these new
zones that the source beds must be looked for.
The main production test has now been com-
menced. This may take & week to ten days to
complete.

An interesting formation is being
opened up by Sutherland and Packet! on
the Mount Claude field (Tas.) about
1000 ft. above the Forth River. The
country is composed of micaceous granite
rock, and the formation, opened in a
pegmatite dyke, is about 30 miles wide,
with a complex vein of beryl, 9in. wide,
on the hanging wall. The separation of
the beryl, zircon and topaz from the wol-
fram, scheelite and carbonate of bismuth
is comparatively easy, and a few selected,
well-shaped zircons of the colorless
variety show excellent brilliance, but
they are very difficult to isolate. Three
separate parallel lines traverse the pro-
perty, and the holders are very hopeful
of the prospect developing into an im-
portant mine.

Four reasons why Great Boulder shares
have advanced sharply in the market are:
(1) An increase in ore reserves, which now
total 547,636 tons, containing 214,6910 z.
of gold ; (2) the new 12,000-ton treat-
ment plant, which will lower costs, is
nearing completion ; (3) the co. is nego-
tiating for an interest in the White
Hope, Hampton Plains, 20 miles south
of Kalgoorlie ; and (4) the directors have
arranged for shareholders to be given the
right to apply for a quota of Fraser’s
proposed issue, presently to be made in
London. The White Hope was conspicu-
ous during the Hampton Plains boom in
1920, when its scrip went to £5 on the
market. In the ’nineties Fraser’s had a
long line of free-milling ore, which was
vigorously worked to a depth of over
400 ft. by the late Archibald Wilson, and
thirteen 6d. divs. were paid before Wilson
transferred his activities elsewhere. The
mine was gutted by his successors, who
did no further shaft-sinking or other
costly developmental work. However,
the prospects of it responding to a second
trial are encouraging. Incidentally,
Deeming, slayer of wives, worked on
Fraser’s as a mechanical engineer. ,

Australian shareholders in Paringa feel
that they have a grievance because local
applicants for the new scrip have to pay
6d. a share in exchange, although the
money they subscribe will not leave
Westralia, and because the option given
to the guarantors, until the end of 1935,
to take up the balance of 279,300 shares
at 4s. each puts them on the box seat
in the event of a further rise in the
market price (4s. 2d. last week-end)
meanwhile. The co., whose headquarters
are in London, has increased its capital
from £70,000 to £120,000 by the creation
of 986,200 new shilling shares, of which
706,900 are offered to shareholders at 2s.
each.
The two shafts, 1200 ft. apart, being
sunk by the Triton Co. are approaching
their first objective—the 300 ft. level. The
management expects that the Emu north
shaft will command 116,000 tons above
the 300 ft. level, which will be a good
start in ore-reserve building. After driv-
ing has been commenced at 300 ft., the
shafts will be deepened to 500 ft. If the
three diamond-drilling campaigns prove
to be a reliable guide, developments
should reward shareholders for the call-
making programme prepared for them.

The Lanarkshire Co., whose share-
holders were about to use their scrip
for wallpaper, reported a find on its
block at Mulline (W.A.), and the scrip
jumped overnight from 3d., with a call
of same amount due, to 2s. in the market.
The Lady Gladys, also at Mulline, was
expected to pay a 6d. div., but made a
shilling call instead. This gave the
market a nasty jolt, of course. Still, the
co. came to the rescue with a
fresh batch of shallow 2oz. to 3oz. dis-
coveries. The call is being made to buy
a battery, though many think its instal-
lation at the moment is premature.

Wiluna’s main shaft is down 1200 ft.;
the objective is said to be 1500 ft. No
outstanding development has been an-
nounced lately, but several good expo-
sures have been made at and above the
1000 ft. level. Although big in every way,
Wiluna has only one operating shaft,
through which up to 300 men a shift
are transported and all underground ser-
vicing is performed, including the haul-
age of over 42,000 tons of ore monthly.
This is said to be a world record.

Golden Horseshoe’s figures show that
gold worth £372,063 (sterling) was won
from retreatment of 1,586,640 tons of
residue dumps between Feb., 1930, and
the end of Sept. last. The original esti-
mate was that the dumps contained 2f
million tons, assaying 7s. lOd. a ton, of
which approximately 45 p.c. was recover-
able. The co.’s finances are snug, and it
has a substantial interest in Wiluna.

London, Australian and General Ex-
ploration Co., which once carried on in
the West and is now interested in Corn-
wall tin, Southern European metals and
Eastern Australian and Kenya gold, has
increased its capital to £250,000 by the
creation of 857,345 new shares of 2s. 6d.
The object is to enable the co. to
“actively follow up the business already
in hand and take advantage of any
further promising opportunities that
might occur.”

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Hell and High Water”
Here is a picture which contains a
rear-admiral (Sir Guy Standing) who in-
dulges in persiflage with the skipper of a
garbage-collecting scow ; Captain Jericho
(Richard Arlen), a rough seafaring
bloke who is virtually an imbecile;
Milton J. Bunsey (William Frawley), who
combines bacchanalian orgies with broad-
cast uplift talks; Sally Driggs (Judith
Allen), who is swiftly translated from a
dance-hall gold-digger to a domesticated
little sentimentalist, and a Japanese lad
(Matsui) who looks like a Jew and talks
like a Dago. Yet the story hangs to-
gether and has many points of interest.
Also there is a spanking good study of
genial old age by Charley Grapewin, and
many touches of dialogical humor that
linger pleasantly in the mind. Nothing
mawkish or maudlin, and the actors have
been picked with a sure hand.
“Ever Since Eve”
Bret Harte was the father of this
Capitol fantasia and wherever he is,
there, we may be sure, was wailing and
gnashing of teeth when he heard what
Hollywood had done to his offspring.
Three comic Californian miners, with
hearts comparable to the mineral they are
seeking, act as foster-fathers to George
O’Brien. O’Brien falls for an aristocratic
New Yorker. It looks like divorce, and
a little stranger is on the way. The
oldsters play a senile trick on George
which sends him galloping, galloping
through the night to find his wife back
at the old ranch, bending over a bas-
sinette. Bitterly reproaching her for her
perfidy, he is checked by the solium
woids: “Do not wake our son! ”
As a fade-out tag it should be popular,
appealing as it does to all sections from
romance-steeped virginibus puerisque to
custodians of teething infants.
“After To-night”
This Regent production is the usual
Hollywood espionage film; a farrago of
melodramatic idiocies. In the matter of
war films most American producers are
in the same plight as the Australian art
critics referred to in a recent Red Page
article: they don’t know. The British
do know, so their war pictures are fairly
naturalistic. Witness “I Was a Spy.”
In “After To-night” Constance Ben-
nett, who is in the pay of Russia, meets
Gilbert Roland, one of the heads of Aus-
tria’s counter-spy organisation. After
certain emotional passages they separate.
He is sent to a town where chemicals
are produced, and finds Miss Bennett
helping at the local C.C.S. or whatever
it is. In this sequence Roland and his
colleagues use a 1934 car, and Miss Ben-
nett’s haircut is of the same period. After
a passionate episode in an unshelled!
wood —Mr. Roland wearing a natty home-
service uniform, Miss Bennett an up-to-
date frock and dyed finger-nails—she goes
back to her spying, he to his counter-
spying. His underlings bowl her out,
and he is going to arrest her, though it
breaks his heart to do so, when someone
shoots him, and she is bundled into a
cart and driven over the frontier. The
last sequence is all smiles. She is
on a railway station after the Armis-
tice with a child when Mr. Roland
appears. He is now a Cook’s guide—or
his costume may be that of a hotel com-
missionaire. Rapture. Wedding bells.
The worst feature of such vulgar rub-
bish is that it makes war look like a
Bright Young Thing’s party. Nursing
in a front-line sector is presented as an
opportunity for unlimited flirting in
exquisite clothes (no Hollywood war
hospital ever has a matron); and the
heroine, after getting the patriot-hero’s
fellow-countrymen slaughtered in droves,
is always accepted as a desirable bride.
“Rafter Romance”
Though Hollywood can’t do intelli-
gent or even endurable spy films, whereas
Elstree rarely fails to, it practically
always makes a success of another form
of entertainment —bedroom farce. The
girls in English farces are too self-con-
sciously genteel as a rule to carry off the
situations. There is no nonsense of the
sort about Ginger Rogers. In “Rafter
Romance” she shares a flat with a young
night-watchman. He has to be out by
8 p.m., she by 8 a.m., so that as flat-sharers
they don’t meet. As employees of the
same firm they fall in love. The comedy
derives from misunderstandings in con-
nection with the flat and allied matters.
Miss Rogers is an adept at expressing
woiking-girl exasperation. She is a mis-
tress of snapping eyelids, inhibitory ges-
tures and what may be called the walk
of renunciation —a flouncing affair which
says more plainly than words, “I’m
finished with you for good, you hound! ”
Sundry Shows
In “The Dubarry” J. C. Williamson,
Ltd., has performed the staggering
feat of transferring Little Lon. to the
boards of the King’s Theatre, Mel-
bourne. No more impressive demon-
stration of the ability of romanticism
to make the pill of reality palatable to a

house of respectable playgoers has ever
been given. Consider Act One, Scene
Five, “The Salon of Madame Sauterelle.”
The salon is a notorious maison toleree,
and Madame (Lorna Forbes) is the most
prominent procuress in Paris. Here a
number of partially clothed nymphs
await the arrival of a number of intoxi-
cated gallants. One of the nymphs
(Sylvia Welling) is an ex-millinery
assistant who has fallen on evil days, and
one of the gallants (Leslie Holland) is
the elderly Comte Dubarry, who has
contributed to her downfall. He spends
a lot of money on her and subsequently
recovers his expenditure, plus a hand-
some profit, by selling her to King Louis
Fifteenth. This sorry tale, told in the
truthful accents of a realist, would have
sent the audience shrieking from the
theatre; and the next “Argus” would
have bulged with the indignant screams
of “Pro Bono Publico” and “Right-
thinker.” Nothing of the sort happens,
for Paul Knepler and J. M. Wil-
leminski know their job—none better.
All they have to do is to make their
characters as unlike life as possible and
to falsify history—the real Dubarry was,
by all accounts, as like Sylvia Welling
and the sexagenarian King Louis as like
Richard Parry as present critic is like
Camera. If fact is stranger than fiction,
it is certainly poorer business, and the
stage “Dubarry” should be in for a long
innings. Because it touches, however
romantically, on themes usually taboo
to the musicomedian, it has numerous
fillips for the jaded appetites of theatre-
goers. It is handsomely presented, the
wassail scene in Dubarry’s dining-room
is made engaging by the art of Cecil
Kellaway, there is some charming danc-
ing by La Camargo and her attendant
coryphees, and his many songs put less
strain on John Dudley than a single bar
of an oratorio. The story is the second
most popular plot in the repertoire of
Hollywood, put 200 years back when
men dressed like birds of paradise.
Sylvia Welling has the lack of voice
requisite for a musicomedy leading lady,
and plays the repentant Magdalen to per-
fection. Nellie Barnes, a clever little girl,
talks neatly with her legs in farce
language.

When Nora Hill, of Sydney, was Gilda
in an A.B.C. performance of “Rigoletto”
The Bulletin, striving to be honest, ex-
plained that it was playing bridge that
evening, went down on a big bid while
“Caro Nome” was being sung, and decided
on that (and possibly other grounds) that
Miss Hill wasn’t quite a Melba.. The
young lady was Lucia in a broadcast on
Sunday evening, a period during which
this critic meditates on his sins of the
past week, eschewing cards, but allows
himself a little operatic refreshment if it
is on tap. Lucia’s mad scene and her
duets with the poor Edgardo (Lionello
Cecil) were grateful and comforting;
Signor Izal’s Lord Ashton was so cruel
to the unfortunate lady that it seemed
as if something ought to be done about
it. Essie Chappie, as the faithful Alisa,
and Ernest Gill, as Normanno, to whom
Donizetti entrusts his most Scottish ex-
pressions of Italian idiom, rounded off
a worth-while performance.
“Collits’ Inn” having lost its license at
Melbourne Princess, after doing a roar-
ing trade, “The Beloved Vagabond” will
take the boards on Saturday. Adapted
from W. J. Locke’s celebrated novel and
set to music by Dudley Glass, it will find
a passage over the footlights via Gladys
Moncrieff’s soprano and Robert Chis-
holm’s tenor. The inclusion of George
Wallace makes this the second practically
Australian musicomedy to be presented
by Frank Thring in one season.
Percy Grainger’s wilful locks will wave
over the grand at the Town Hall, Mel-
bourne, largely in works of the per-
former’s own composition or arrange-
ment on Saturday.
There is no keeping down a good
actress. Australia’s old friend May
Beatty is still in harness, and recently
scored a success in a legitimate produc-
tion at Hollywood which so pleased
Columbia that a film is to be made of
it, with May in the star role. She also
appears anonymously in a tango with
George Raft in the film “Bolero.”
Daughter Bunny made her debut lately
on the screen as a disagreeable infant
of 11.

The legitimate stage still has a vigor-
ous kick in it. Some of Lunnon’s shows
have runs to their credit reminiscent of
the palmy days when Oscar Asche could
have taken a world tour incognito and
not been missed if his understudy in
“Chu Chin Chow” had been a couple of
stone heavier. “While Parents Sleep”
has two years and one month behind it,
and is still going. “Fresh Fields” began
its career last January twelvemonth, and
“The Late Bordeaux,” “Richard of Bor-
deaux,” “The Late Christopher Bean,”
“Proscenium” and “Music in the Air”
will be a year old shortly.

STAGE FEVER.
(Apologies to John Masefield.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I must go back to the stage again,
To the footlights and the paint:
For the one-night stands and the changing
scene,
My heart is like to faint.
And all 1 ask is the call-boy’s tap,
And the “first-night” waver,
And the lime's hiss, and the white “spot,”
And the music’s quaver.
I must go back to the stage again,
For the call is loud and clear:
To the trouper folk I used to know,
And whose chaff I long to hear.
And all I ask is the baton’s rap
For my number calling,
And the “big” scene, and the hushed house.
And the curtain falling.

The Palette.
John Rowell, the painter of staccato
sunshine effects, has been once more open
for inspection at Melbourne Athenaeum.
Nearly all his pieces are played at the
treble end of the keyboard, and this gives
his landscapes a stinging quality, as if
one had suddenly come out of a dark-
ened interior into the blazing noonday
and one’s eyes had not had time to adjust
themselves. The show was hence not with-
out a suspicion of monotony, despite the
variety of its subject matter. Neverthe-
less, within his limitations, Rowell is an
accomplished craftsman who would say
things better if he did not attempt to
say so many things at once. When the
observer was in danger of sunburn through
overexposure to Australia’s cheapest
asset, he could crawl into the shelter of
the “Granite Outcrop” in No. 25, a bold
rendering of light and shadow contrasts.
P. S. Hobday, a long-standing presi-
dent of the Queensland Royal Society of
Artists, has an exhibition of water-
colors and monotypes in the Academy
Salon (Gowing’s Buildings) in Sydney.
He is probably Queensland’s finest
landscape water-colorist, and there is a
faithfulness about his work and a
soundness in his composition lacking in
that of a lot of the younger men. Few
Australians have attempted the mono-
type —“the etcher’s oil painting” —and
Mr. Hobday’s exhibition is the first full-
dress display of the new technique seen
in Sydney.
Versatility was the main note of Dora
Wilson’s show at Adelaide Society of
Arts. With a nude or two to recall
her former triumphs she now relies
mainly on landscape, always soundly ren-
dered. She ranges from Adelaide Gov-
ernment House to Melbourne Cathedral,
from Melbourne’s Collins-street to Edin-
burgh’s Princes-street, from Bruges to
Venice. The lady’s Selection, in the
main, is admirable; her Rejection, in
detail, is lacking; many a maker of
liquor or costumes gets artistic immor-
tality because his ad. happened to be
prominent when she passed.
“Meldrumite”: The two portraitists
who shared the walls of the Meldrum
Gallery, Melbourne, last week, Colin
Colahan and Justus Jorgensen, have
obviously the same aim, and their
results are only different in the degree
to which they attain it. One may give
a more unsullied impression of his sub-
ject than his neighbor, but the discre-
pancy would not be so striking as to be
obvious to the lay observer. The effect
one carries away, therefore, is of having
been in the presence of six or seven
assorted individuals, which is not the
case when one comes away from the
usual portrait exhibition. Colahan had
a striking presentation of Alfred Hill
deliberating over his viola, and another of
a woman in a fur coat who looked as if
she had stepped out of a Russian novel.
Jorgensen’s self-portrait and the head of
an abo. belonged to the same order of
merit.

ABORIGINALITIES

“Lodis”: Dave ran out of cash in Bris-
bane and wired Dad for a tenner. But
Dad knew all about city crooks who
telegraph for money in other people’s
names. He sent the tenner, but told the
M.O. branch not to pay out unless the
applicant could give the name of his best
milker, which he named. Though he’d
been celebrating, Dave hadn’t forgotten
Matilda, and collected. The precaution
would have baffled the shrewdest of
tricksters.

“Barangkali”: Sydney Zoo’s latest
acquisition, a 16ft. crocodile from N.Q.,
is showing a tendency to hunger-strike,
and forcible feeding has been resorted to.
A few gentle taps on his headpiece from
a 10ft. sapling induce the saurian to open
his jaws, probably in protest; the keeper
takes advantage of this to throw a noose
around the top jaw. His confederate
forces food into the gaping mouth, and
rams it home with a long pole. Newly-
captured pythons invariably refuse food
for some weeks. To keep the larger and
more valuable specimens in good condi-
tion, the Malays kill and clean a dozen
fowls, tying the neck of one to the
“Shay, fever see a prayin’ mantis bigger’n that?”
legs of another until a chain of poultry
is lying ready. With a dozen Malays
holding the crawler as straight as pos-
sible, the operator, helped by a blunt
stick, forces the first bird into the rep-
tile’s mouth. The first taste of food
overcomes the python’s disinclination to
eat, the rest of the birds being taken
without further persuasion.
* * * *
“Pakeha Maori”: “Comboyuro Kid”
(B. 21/3/’34) is off the track with his
colony of white grubs found in a salt-
water-saturated log. This grub is not the
edible species found in the bush, but a
variety loathed by boat-owners, known as
the cobra. It has a nasty habit of attack-
ing any vessel left on moorings for any
length of time, with disastrous results
to the boat.
* * * *
“Coif”: A country friend in Sydney
for the Show told me of a happening up
his way which contains all the elements
of a most interesting orgy of litigation.
Xis a market gardener; Z, who dwells
close by, is a timber-getter who
breeds fowls in his hours of
ease. The fowls have played
the deuce with the seedlings of
X, whose protests to Z were
received with scoffing. X sought
legal advice, and was told that
he might shoot the trespassing
fowls, but on no account to
move them from his land, a job
that would have to be done by
the owner. Several fowls were
shot and left as they fell. Next
day Z called to remove his
fowls. He brought a team of
10 bullocks along with him and
demanded the right of entry,
which could not be refused. Then
he snigged each dead fowl out sepa-
rately with his team. X is still staring
dumbly at what was once his garden and
considering his next move.
“Tumoulin”: “Matilda” (B. 14/3/’34)
says nothing to the point. As for his
assertion that a man can burst a canvas
bag of water with a careless brush of
his hand, it would be very imprudent to
spar with a water-bag on a dry stage —
dreadfully so if the bag were rotten. No
genuine sundowner ever stands his water-
bag up to be spanked or sparred with
or pushed or blown over. He hangs it
up securely or scoops a hollow in the
sand or earth in which to stand it.
* * * *
“J.D.H.”: “G.M.L.” was much too
credulous concerning the surgical ability
of Nellie’s mother (B. 7/3/’34). It might
be possible for a gin to make an incision
in the skin of the abdomen with a piece
of hoop-iron and close it with a bag-
needle and string, but it would not be
possible in the case of a more delicate
part. Furthermore, a cut made across
the abdomen would necessarily pierce the
peritoneum, and the cutting of the peri-
toneum is an operation no surgeon will
undertake if he can avoid it, on account
of the grave risk of peritonitis. I pre-
“I can’t see anything in
these wood-chopping
contests. The sight

like that gives me a
pain in the neck.”
sume that the “surgeon” in this case left
the internal organs to close themselves,
as she could hardly* close them with a
bag-needle and string. Hence I feel
sorry for Nellie when the next little
Csesar comes along.
* * * *
“Purari”: Description of the units of
the Lakatoi fleets of Central Papua as
“boats” (B. 4/4/’34) is wide of the mark.
The craft consists
of platforms built
over a number of
large canoes lashed
together, the pot-
tery carried for
trading from Port
Moresby being
stowed in these
canoes. One of
the reasons for the
trip is the replen-
ishment of the
canoes, the trees
from which these
are made being
unobtainable at
home. After land-
ing, the admiral of
the flotilla tells his
hosts how many
new canoes he will
want. He is taken
into the forest,
where he selects
the desired trees.
These are felled
and hollowed out
for him by the
locals when a price
has been agreed
upon, and then re-
place the worn-out
and condemned
canoes which
sailed from
Hanuabada. Sago,
unobtainable in the
Central district, is
also traded in and
replaces the pottery
as the horn e-
ward cargo. The
Lakatoi can only run before the wind.
That is why they go west blown by the
s.-e. monsoon and return propelled by
the n.-w.

“Murlonga”; In 1913, when Gover-
nor of Queensland, Sir William Mac-
Gregor toured the back country with his
staff, and strayed over the border.
He had been told a tale or two during
his travels, and he was turning them
over in his Scottish mind. At Lake Nash
station he met D. C. Thompson, the
manager. I don’t think D.C. has ever
appeared in print before, which is a
loss to print. The old man, dead these
several years, was telling the Gov. about
the wants of the back country, the neces-
sity for development, the culpable neglect
of Government and a lot more to the
same effect. He paused to catch his
breath before shooting off again, when
Sir William leaned forward, anxious to
make the most of the break in the flow
of words. “Tell ma,” he said impres-
sively, tapping D.C.’s knee to emphasise
his point, “did ye ever see a pig eat a
snake?”
* * * *
Forward the bell-wethers and their
tribe:
“Yalcalpa”: On Coan Downs, western
N.S.W., there was a merino wether that led the
sheep from yards to catching pens, returning
to the yards via the board. He was black,
tall and gaunt, a ghastly sight from a breeder’s
point of view; but he did his stuff for 24 years.
“S.G.M.”: An overseer of Mogil, an out-
station of Goondablui (N.S.W.), had one which,
provided his dogs were in the lead, would
follow them across the Barwon River when a
couple of feet deep and 20 yards wide. It
turned him in many a pound.
“King Billy” had acquired a per-
verted taste for brandy and milk out of a
bottle. At shearing time dad used to give us
kids an empty bottle; with this we would run
into the shed, followed by Billy at a trot, and
the mob following Billy. But one day his
Majesty smelt whisky in a shearer’s breath. The
system broke down there and then. I shall
never forget the agony and reproach in the
poor brute’s face as he died.
“Banjo Bill”: The pride of Longburn
freezers, Palmerston North (M.L.), is “Old Joe.”
Deficient in teeth but fat as mud, he walks
ahead of the mob at Government pace until
some slaughterman shouts “Get up, Joe!”
Then he breaks into a trot. The smell of blood
doesn’t worry Joseph; if he can’t get back to
the yards by the back race he walks through
a catching pen and down the killing board.
“Teg.”: An old lady living near the Edwards
River bridge, Deniliquin (N.S.W.) district, hires
her pets to drovers at ten shillings a time. No
one ever refuses to spar up, as most sheep are
averse to crossing the garish iron structure.
“G.W.R.”: The boss of Ashmore station,
south-east S.A., has two merinos that will
follow him anywhere. Penning up at crutching-
and shearing-time is a simple matter, and when
rain threatens and we wish to push the woollies
into the shed there is no yelling, barking, or
bad language. The older wether will follow a
man on horseback, too—a useful gift in coun-
try where sheep should have webbed feet in
the winter. And he will eat tobacco by the
pound if he can get it.
“Jumping Jimmy”: We live by the Gwydir
(N.S.W.), opposite the trucking yards, and
have to swim the sheep over. Ever since our
decoys were poddy lambs they have followed
our milking cows around; so when we want
to take sheep over the river we first drive the
milkers in. The decoys follow, and then the
rest of the sheep.
* * * *
“0.5.”: Bill, who had spent all his
life in the bush, was telling me about his
neighbor Hermann. “My word, his people
must be well in,” Bill said. “Hermann
was showing me a photo, of his home in
Germany—a big, high building, and the
people live one on top of the other.”
“It’s a flat,” I replied, and thereupon I
explained to him the mysteries of flat
life. “Rummy idea!” said Bill. “Where
do they keep the fowls?”
GOING TO WORK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With my axe upon my shoulder
And my kelpie running free,
I set out across the paddocks in the dawn;
Moss glows green on every boulder
And mists, rising drowsily,
Softly gleam like elfin etchings, faintly
drawn.
There’s a magic in this hour,
Ere the sun breaks through the blue
Thrusting fancy into limbo with its gold.
Each tree is a spangled tower
Shot with opal fire of dew,
With a tangle of pale pearls in every fold.
In the chrome hills birds are stirring,
Parrots green as goblins’ eyes
Dip among the jade-cowled brackens,
feather light;
And with widespread pinions whirring,
Flocks of bronzewing pigeons rise
Beating sweetness from the musk boughs
in their flight.
Then the sun comes up in glory;
And the magic melts like mist
In this bolder glow that enters with a
rush;
And the tender mystic story,
With its tints of amethyst,
Dies before the throbbing music of the
thrush!

THE GUINEA PRIZE.
J. C. Leete, Bryali station, via Meeka-
tharra ( W.A. ), collects the guinea, plus
space rates, for this: —
I was driving the car at the back
of Meekatharra (W.A.) when some
’roos streaked across my track, one
carrying a joey in her pouch. I
tooted the horn, and Ma Kangaroo
made a frantic leap over a small
mulga. The next instant there was
an eruption. Ma slithered on her
ear ; then I saw a big emu beating
it for parts unknown with Master
Joey sprawled on his back. After
doing a quarter-mile at about 12
to the furlong, Mr. Emu swerved
abruptly and dislodged the quaint-
est jockey I’ve yet seen.


“A.H.S.”: Any member of the Council
ever seen a cat properly sozzled? Tom
found his way into the pantry, where
cook had prepared some wine trifle, and
had a good innings while her back was
turned. His subsequent efforts to get
through the kitchen door would have
brought a smile to the face of an econo-
mist. He made three attempts to find the
opening, but only succeeded in butting
into the wall each time. We escorted
him to the top of the steps. He couldn’t
face the descent, and went down back-
wards. A very sorry puss spent the fol-
lowing day alongside an outsize can of
water, in the shade of a big eucalypt.

“Mho”: Fishing for trout in Tasmania,
I hooked one about .three-quarters of a
pound. It made several jumps and rushes
and then went to the bottom. I com-
menced to reel in, and then found that
the small fish had disappeared, his place
being taken by one of over six pounds.
This fish—a rainbow —was eventually
landed, and the original three-quarter-
pounder was found inside. I am now
claiming two records—(l) two trout
caught at the same time on one fly ; (2)
a trout hooked and landed by the inside
lining of its stomach.

“FY7”: “Liss’s” dissertation on poddy
lambs (B. 28 /3 / ’34) moves me to ask
whether he has ever warmed a pet lamb
in his bosom, in a manner of speaking, to
find it turn and rend him like a roaring
lion —also in a manner of speaking—
when it had grown to a wicked maturity.
The writer and his brothers and sisters
suffered this sad experience on the
Queensland station where our infant lots
were cast. A lamb having been acquired,
the family fought for weeks as to which
should feed it. As it grew, the argument
raged as to which shouldn’t feed it at
“Nowadays, dearie, all men git on me nerves”
’Aven’t I alwus told yer it’s best ter be married? On’y me ’usband gits on
mine.”
that particular time, everyone claiming
to have been the last to officiate. When
the lamb grew up, it invariably became
the terror that pranced by day. None of
the juveniles dared to venture outside
the protecting fence about the “big
house ’ beyond which the woolly menace
lurked unceasingly. To do so was to
invite a catastrophic butting, for bare
feet could not venture off beaten paths
carpeted on each side by steel-pointed
bindei. The lamb knew all the paths,
and when they were likely to be used,
and was always posted for attack along
one or other of them. It was a happy
release when the brute was drafted to the
station killing mob. Then we got hold
of another sucker, and began all over
again.
* * *
“Snow”: Monkeys catching fleas are
not in it compared with a goanna catch-
ing ticks. The other day (it was a Sun-
day, so I was sober) I saw what I tooj£
to be a root on the road. Closer inspec-
tion revealed a large goanna, so busy
ticking himself that he could have easily
been run over.
* * * *
“El V.”: It is true, as “6Q.J.” opines
(B. 4/4/’34), that Binghi doesn’t often
get snake-bitten, but neither does any-
body else in Australia. If our mortal
snake figures per head of population
were the same as India’s, about 5000
citizens of the Commonwealth would
lose their votes regularly between Christ-
mas and Christmas. Usually the care is
on the side of the snake. In A.sia the
cobra is an up and coming fellow, always
ready for a little nonsense. The hama-
dryad—a fearsome beastie about 10ft.
long—will attack on sight, and the krait
and the Arabian desert snakes seem to
take such a positive pleasure in waiting
round for a victim that I think they must
get a commission on scalps from OH
Nick. With us even the Arnhem Land
brown snake, which reaches a dozen feet
in length, and the death adder prefer
to leave you alone, and usually when
you get into trouble with them it is be-
cause you have broken the local traffic
laws inadvertently. After experience in
the snakiest parts of the continent, I
would sooner live in a 50-acre paddock
with 100 of our worst snakes than with
one cobra or black mamba.
* * * *
“Powlathanga”: One of the weirdest
and least-known of our bush creatures is
the flying mouse —the feather-tailed
phalanger, Pygmeus acrobates, or words
to that effect. If anyone wants one I’ll
tell where I got mine, and, if there are
any left, the other fellow might get one.
Go to the Burdekin Tableland (N.Q.).
Chop down ten thousand gum-trees and
keep the eyes doubly skinned. You
might get one ; you might draw a blank.
It’s only a bit of a thing, no bigger than
a house mouse: grey above, creamy
below, fox-snouted and with the pro-
truding eyes of a nocturnal forager. It
has a parachute web between its front
and its hind legs ; a marsupial pouch no
bigger than a pin’s head ; its tail is longer
than its body—prehensile, ribbed in
miniature like the backbone of a fish.
It has a distaste for the ground almost
amounting to a horror; an ability to run
up perpendicular walls with the ease of
a shadow; a fighting propensity which,
if it were backed by weight, would give
it the power to beat Camera one hand,
kneeling ; and the power to launch itself
into the air from a height and to vol-
plane to the ground at a distance from
its take-off which is equal to the square
of the hypotenuse of a right-angled
triangle. It lives in the trees, curling
up in some small hollow and sleeping
during the day. It forages at night after
sweet scale, white ants and other small
things. While on the ground it hops
like a ’roo, if hurried, dropping its front
“Is there nothing to shoot on this dam ’ place but rabbits?”
“Aw, I dunno. There’s the boss down in the other paddock.”
paws to the earth about every ten or
a dozen strides to regain its balance, and
then, with its feather tail curled well
over its back, it’s off for the lick of its
life again, hopping prodigiously and mak-
ing for some shelter up which it can
climb and get away from the hated
ground.
“Sorrento”: Some Mel-
bourne enthusiast suggested
that there might be a profit-
able trade in fresh oysters with
those lands which lie north-
west of Australia and are
always referred to as “the
East.” Victorian experts fell
heavily on the suggestion, say-
ing it would be impossible to
keep the things alive long
enough. These have been
countered by David Stead, for
long head of the N.S.W.
Fisheries Department and
father of the trawling trade ;
he says Ma State and Queens-
land oysters can be carried in
a live condition for several
weeks if properly looked after.
Apropos, in the mid-’nineties
the oyster-eaters of Brisbane
(I was one of them) were
roused to cold fury by the in-
crease of the price of a large
plate of oysters from 6d. to
9d. The profiteers declared in
self-defence that the lessees of
Moreton Bay oyster beds were
shipping their stock by sea to
the Westralian mines so fast
that there was trouble in sup-
plying local demand. Later, I
travelled as far as Sydney in
an A.U.S.N. boat, the Wod-
onga, whose usually roomy
promenade deck was crammed
with bags of oysters labelled
for Westralia. What they
tasted like when they got there
I cannot say, but I’ve no
doubt the hardy inhabitants
of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie were game
to come at them.
* * * *
“Snaegle”: I can put a gambling stunt
on the market calculated to make
“Isharagi’s” beetle 100 (B. 28/3/’34) look
cross-eyed. Snail-racing. For dependability
it licks the beetle game to blazes. One
drawback to the beetle is that you never
know when he won’t “flap he little wings
an’ fly,” as the old coon song used to
have it; in that case, both punters and
the banker are stonkered. With the
snail, there is no chance of your fancy
running off the course. You don’t need
an elaborately divided cloth. Draw a
circle on the ground or anywhere else
of the size desired. At its centre make
a much smaller one. When every owner
has got his snail saddled and marked
with his colors the field is placed by
the starter —front outward in the inner
circle —and the flag falls. The first snail
over the circumference of the large circle
wins. Betting “in running” is one of
the attractions, and there are as many
readies and hairy goats as can be found
in the ranks of the four-legged animals
which Kipling has so optimistically
named “Man’s first servants.” .
**• « *
“Quaker”: If you were to take a terres-
trial globe and push a needle straight
through it at the spot in the far north
or Norway marked “Maelstrom” by care-
ful geographers, the point of your needle
would come out at a spot in the far
south Pacific notable because it lies on
the line of a weakness in the earth’s
crust. Cosmic forces constantly bring
pressure to play on this weak line, and
every few years there are collapses that
shake the whole sphere. Luckily, the
earth is very elastic, and only places near
the line of fault, such as Maoriland and
Japan, suffer inconvenience. There was
another weak spot under the southern
Pacific, thousands of miles further east,
that wrecked San Francisco, but this
seems to have gummed itself up. It has
taken the Maorilanders close on a cen-
tury to become convinced that proximity
to a weak point in the crust is a matter
affecting the craft of architects and
builders. The first .generation of settlers
knew all about it. After disastrous ex-
periences in Wellington with edifices of
brick and stone they built in wood—the
first Parliament House in Wellington was
the biggest wooden building in the world.
Many years of seismological peace lulled
Maoriland into a feeling of security. If
big ’quakes did come along they hap-
pened in sparsely-populated districts. The
Hawke’s Bay upheaval of 1931 smote
two large towns severely. A shudder a
little further south this year filled Pahia-
tua with jumbles of bricks. The City
Fathers of Wellington have take alarm.
The tower and the portico of the capital’s
Town Hall are to come down, and the
regulations made by statute in 1931
banning the construction of overhanging
cornices and tall towers of brick or
stone may possibly be made retrospec-
tive. But the outlook for the architects
isn’t very restricted. If they frame with
steel and clothe the skeletons with con-
crete they can still draft with a free
fancy.
WHEN THE NORTH WIND CALLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun shines bright in the South, I know,
But ever 1 long again
For northern hills where the pack-teams go,
And vales where the leaping rivers flow,
Bank-high from the summer rain.
To the tracks I knew out Rossville way
I am borne on fancy’s wing;
To long lagoons where the wild ducks play,
Where stealthy abos. stalk their prey,
My memories fondly cling.
The mountains glow in the morning light,
The mists from the valleys rise,
And the sun above the scrub-clad height
Sees the fleecy clouds like ships of white
Afloat in the bluest skies.
I think of the hill where my old home stands;
And ever I long to be
By shelter'd bays with their golden strands,
Where the broad Endeavour sweeps her sands
Far out to the Coral Sea.
And yearnings come, though the years are gone,
And the days in the South are fair,
For nights where the tropic starlight shone;
And a voice still calls me on and on
To the Northland waiting there.

PRINCE GEORGE’S ADVANCE
AGENT SENDS HIS IMPRESSIONS
TO THE FIFTH EQUERRY.
II. — Melbourne.
His Highness will like Melbourne. The
Lord Mayor told me so. He’ll feel quite
at home once he gets used to the names
of the streets. It appears that when they
named the streets they didn’t have enough
names to go round, so they made every
second street half-size and called it
“Little.” The Prince will be well advised
to stick to the big streets and avoid the
“Littles.” But, of course, his Highness
will use his own discretion.
He can scarcely miss the River Yarra,
a noble and fragrant stream which has
well been termed the lifeblood of Mel-
bourne. It is, of
course, proverbial
that blood is thicker
than water.
Besides being
handy for ships to
sail up, the river is
more or less essen-
tial to the success of
Henley - on - Yarra
and the Head-of-the-
River race; very
convenient for sui-
cides, and an excuse
for three bridges,
innumerable weak
jokes and two
poems by Words-
worth.
The Prince may
not like the Yarra,
but urge him to be
tactful about it.
Then there’s St.
Kilda. He’ll pro-
bably like this place.
It will remind him
of the week-end he
spent at Blackpool.
The Mayor is
anxious for him to
stay at St. Kilda. He
has promised to
demonstrate the
grips that were used
to keep Blackie and
Ironmonger out of
the Australian Eleven for 30 years.
However, I think it would be wiser for
him to stay in a quieter suburb. Say
Footscray. This would be handy in case
he should have to walk home from
Flemington.
Of course Menzies will take him in
hand and show him round —clever
fellow, Menzies—but in case he should
be too busy his Highness must not miss
the Art Gallery (at Young and Jack-
son’s), the Aquarium and the Morgue
(Spring-street).
On the whole, I think the Prince will
like Melbourne. After all, he may strike
one or two fine days.
And don’t forget to remind him that
Melbourne is the place that’s having the
Centenary, even if they don’t know how
to pronounce it.

CIVIC PRIDE.
“Ridiculous the way these Melbourne
and Sydney people quarrel about their
cities,” he remarked to me as we sat in
the smoke-room of
the Westunda, in
the middle of the
Bight. Certainly the
occupants of the
next table were get-
ting rather heated.
Fragments of their
conversation had
come to me as I sat
there.
“Now take the
bridge.”
“Bah! Ugly Mec-
cano model. Now
for a carefully laid-
out city, Melb”
“What about Syd-
ney Harbor?” And
so on.
“Well,” I remark-
ed to my com-
panion, “I suppose
it’s only natural to
stand up for one’s
native town.”
“That’s just the
point,” he rejoined.
“I know both those
fellows. The Syd-
ney man was born
in Melbourne and
has only been living
in Sydney since the
war; the Melbourne
man until five years
ago thought the sun rose at Coogee and
set somewhere beyond Lane Cove River.
They’re making virtue out of necessity,
that’s what they’re doing. Circumstances
force them to live in a particular city,
so they bluff themselves it’s the finest
place on earth.”
The voices at the adjoining table were
raised again.
“That! A poky little place; not much
bigger than a vjllage. Conservative
people with antiquated ideas. Abso-
lutely dead!”
“I agree with you there,” said the
other. “How anyone could want to live
in the town is more than I can see.”
“They’re talking about Adelaide now,”
explained my companion.
He leaned across towards them.
“You’re right,” he said. “A stagnant
backwater! Now contrast it with
Perth”
“It’s Perth we’re discussing,” came
from the other table.
My companion sprang to his feet and
his face underwent a violent change.
“Perth!” he shouted. “Well, of all the
cheek! Village! Antiquated! Let me
tell you that Perth is a model city.
Modern and up to date in every respect!
And we don’t want you Easterners in-
terfering in our affairs.” He left us
abruptly.
The Melbourne man looked at the
Sydney man. “Isn’t that Wilkins?”
asked the former.
“Yes.”
“Well, I’m damned! Lived nearly all
his life in Adelaide. His firm sent him
over to Perth last September.”

and the national home of the talkies is

WHAT A CAR!
“His speed was not more than 35 miles
per annum.” —Witness at Sydney police court.
His car, an ancient roadster, stood
outside the G.P.O. A tent was lashed
upon its hood —the job was done with
tow ; a folding primus stove, a pan (sug-
gesting roadside camps), a tucker-bag and
billy-can hung from the parking lamps.
A sporting gun, an angler’s sack, with rod
and net complete, together with a blanket-
pack upon the rumble-seat.
A yearning for the open road touched
me as I stood near, considering that
nomad’s load of sundry touring gear.
At length so strong the longing grew to
know his purpose that “I guess you’re
off to Bungadoo,” I said, “or Piper’s
Flat? The Condamine or Cooper’s
Creek, Cape York or Ingomar? Or else
perhaps the road you seek that leads to
Marble Bar? Or Meekatharra’s barren
ground attracts your wand’ring soul? Or
Starlight’s famed Wilpena Pound—is that
perhaps your goal?”
The tourist gazed at me awhile a trifle
wistfully. “Oh, no,” he answered with
a smile, “I’m making for the Quay.”

NOTIONS
poor fourth. The sensational backing
of Rogilla was a feature of the day’s
racing. Opening at 10’s, the support was
so solid that he closed at 4’s, and caused
Peter Pan to ease from 2’s to 3’s.
Under the Whip
The late scratching of Celebrate
obliged this Page to alter its tip for the
Doncaster, but it was right in its surmise
that the Magpie gelding would pay his
way at Randwick. He was reserved for
the Coogee Handicap on the Wednes-
day, and it proved the best betting race
of the meeting ; the closing quote was
8 to 1 the field, and at one time or other
10’s could be got about anything. Cele-
brate did his job handsomely. Never
further back than second, he passed the
leader, Persian, at the distance, and soon
had him settled ; Ranchero led the rest,
a strung-oUt lot. It was Celebrate’s first
successful essay over the distance, a
mile and a furlong, which he traversed
in lmin. 51 sec.
Confab (12 to 1), another Magpie, also
came home at an unfamiliar distance—
-13 furlongs—in the City Handicap. He
was ridden a heady race by little Parr.
Confab and Turbulent, another winner
at the meeting, are owned and trained
by Jack Kelso, who had been out of luck
for years, though a knowledgeable and
painstaking trainer. But long spells of
misfortune happen to all of them.
Idiotic booming of Rogilla was the
means of putting a lot of money into

the equal of Phar Lap, the Newcastle
gelding proved no match for Chatham in
the All-aged Stakes ; yet a multitude of
confiding people took 2 to 1 about his
chance, while evens could be got about
Chatham’s, although, compared with the
Doncaster, Chatham had 81b. the better
of the weights. Without being over-
exerted, Chatham ran the mile in lmin.
36Jsec. Kuvera cut Rogilla out of third
place.
Chatham’s sire, Windbag, had a habit
of loafing in a race when he had the
opposition disposed of. Peter Pan pos-
sesses the same propensity. He did not
condescend to tackle Oro until the last
furlong of the two-mile Cumberland
Plate, and at the finish the margin in
his favor was only a length. He could
have made it a great deal more. Pike’s
fees and presents for riding Chatham
and Peter Pan, and the great reception
he got, compensated him for his un-
happy experiences in Melbourne. Be-
cause the journey took them 3min. 39|sec.
the Cumberland Plate prize-money was
reduced from £lOOO to £5OO. But it is
not to be expected that horses like Peter
Pan and Hall Mark should make their
own running. Why doesn’t the A.J.C.
buy or lease a horse for these events?
A lucky run on the rails over the
last furlong enabled Rogilla to win
the King’s Cup at Randwick by
a head from Peter Pan, with Kuvera
half a head away and Limarch a
The lightly weighted Mr. Kerry saw
that there was no loafing when the field
settled down. Walter Brunton’s gelding
led Oro, Peter Pan, Silver Scorn, Kuvera
and Rogilla into the straight, the last-
named having made a forward move on
the rails. A furlong from home Mr.
Kerry was beaten, and, moving out with
Oro, gave Rogilla a run on the rails
which Darby Munro took. A few yards
from the post Peter Pan, in the middle,
was hampered by Kuvera, on the out-
side. He appeared to roll over on
the chestnut, and Jim Pike just failed
to get his mount in front.
It was a great finish, but the luck was
with Rogilla, who, had he been forced
to go round his opponents at the Leger
instead of waiting for the run on the
rails, would probably have failed to get
a place. The next meeting of Rogilla and
Peter Pan will be watched closely. The
spring w.f.a. events should decide who is
the champion.
As expected, Chatham had a runaway
victory in the Cropper Plate. He started
at 7 to 2 on, and, after getting away at a
snail-like pace, had the race won turn-
ing for home. Closing Time was a poor
second, and Golden Wings in the minor
place. Chatham’s owner, A. E. Blair,
won £3225 in prize-money at the meet-
ing, and his nag is undoubtedly Aus-
tralia’s best sprinter and miler.
Scone pastoralist V. M. White saw his
colors carried to victory twice at the
carnival. High won a division of the
Vaucluse Handicap on the first day, and
on Saturday he won the Rous Handicap
from Whittingham and La Vixen. It was
a really smart performance, for the win-
ner went to the front and led through-
out. He was well backed at B’s after
10’s had been secured for some good
amounts. High is an improving three-
year-old and worth keeping in mind for
the next Epsom.
The lady who races as “Miss Lorna
Doone” has a Derby candidate in
the Silvius colt Sylvandale. He was
lucky to beat stable-mate Theo in
the Fernhill Handicap, but Sylvandale,
who is a half-brother to Trenette and
the Victorian Veridique, is bred the right
way, and looks all over a stayer. He
was quoted at 12’s. Theo was always
favorite, but lost position at the turn by
getting on to the heels of Sylvandale.
Artful Clare was third, and the consistent
Turbulent fourth.
Blixten was all the rage for the Dangar
Handicap. He was in a sour mood and
was never going kindly. He failed to
gain a place, the much-travelled Gipps-
land (5 to 1) winning narrowly from
Tingalba and the outsider Balgay. Light-
ning March ran a nice even race and
should win soon. Confab was a dis-
appointment in view of his all-the-way
win in the City Handicap.
Queensland performer Rivalli (14 to 1)
sent the bookies home rejoicing, as he
led practically all the way in the Final
Handicap to win from Milantheon and
little Australia Fair. The favorite, Gold
Digger, who was heavily bandaged on the
forelegs, had every chance, but came
home very tired. Braeburn was tailed off
most of the way ; that he finished fourth
says a lot for his chances at the June
carnival at Randwick.
Frank Dempsey, who won the Sydney
Cup of 1921 on Eurythmie and figured
in many a tussle at Randwick when first
jockey to the stable of Jack Holt, did not
attend the A.J.C. autumn meeting this
year. At Epsom on Saturday he gave the
younger fry a lesson on making a finish-
ing run. Bardinet, whom Dempsey rode
in the Two-year-old Handicap, was
backed down to equal favoritism with De
Graves. The latter, a Burnewang colt
belonging to A. G. Hunter, had finished
an impressive third at Williamstown on
the previous Saturday after hanging out
badly at the home turn. Services of
Harold Skidmore were obtained for De
Graves at Epsom, and he threatened to
go out at cramped odds until Eric Con-
nolly started a rush for Bardinet. Demp-
sey bided his time, and, allowing his
mount to become balanced, challenged
the leaders after entering the straight,
but was beaten in trying to get between
two horses. Taken to the outside Bardi-
net defeated De Graves by more than a
length. The Tyson brothers, owners of
Bardinet, saw the King’s Cup at Randwick
while their colors were winning in Mel-
bourne. Dick O’Donnell, who trains for
them, captured the Victoria Derby for
the executors of John Brown with Bal-
loon King.
Located in Sydney some years ago,
J. E. Smedley, the former Westralian
trainer, landed the Epsom Plate on Satur-
day with Blue Chequer, who favors his
sire Chrysolaus in color. Of the other
five runners four were preferred to Blue
Chequer. Dame Isa started a slightly
better favorite than Porcia, a three-year-
old filly by Heroic, owned by book-
maker J. J. Langley. Dame Isa, who
lost by only a neck, might have won if
she had not met with interference. Blue
Chequer is rising seven.
McShortodds scored again when
Yanac, a four-year-old stallion by
Woorak, pipped Septima by half a head
in the first division of the Trial Handi-
cap. Septima was nearly as good a
favorite as MabSie, whereas Yanac went
out at 6’s. A. F. Gollin races Septima
in conjunction with R. N. McLean, of
Sydney. Septima was second-last after
two furlongs. He came with a great run
in the straight, and was a good thing
beaten. Mabsie, the favorite, belongs
to F. H. Robinson, who imported Stowe,
a Stedfast gelding that might have won
in the best company if he had been
sound.
Gothic, the dual Newmarket Handicap
winner who died during the absence in
England of owner Sol Green, was repre-
sented in the second division of the Trial
fry the winner, Tracyllene. Second
honors went to What Joy, a sister to
Beaunilly, the Westralian mare that was
banned on Melbourne courses because
of unruliness at the post.

W. (Billy) McGee, who trained Sydney
Cup winner Broad Arrow, is a native of
N.S.W. South Coast and well known in
Nowra and Bega. Before joining the
ranks of A.J.C. trainers he won races on
pony tracks with Canard and Beryl Jean,
Rosehill trainer W. Booth, who bred
Broad Arrow, sold him for 35 guineas
to his present owner, who races as
“M. Brook” and is a pastoralist at Wal-
gett. Broad Arrow was such a poor
yearling that he was not raced until four
years old. Now he is a fine type of chest-
nut gelding. He is by Treclare (sire of
the A.J.C. Derby winner Tregilla) from
Bowstring, by Bowman—Tamar, by
Charlemagne 11.

Victorian two-year-olds are definitely
superior to ours. The Cabbage Garden
won the A.J.C. Sires’ Produce Stakes
with Dark Sky, and the Champagne
with Great Legend. The latter is raced
in partnership by H. Guy Raymond, a
member of the V.R.C. committee, and
H. B. Ranken, a Queensland squatter.
Both sportsmen run the St. Albans stud
at Geelong, where the imported horse
Great Star is standing. Great Legend’s
victory should keep his sire in the lime-
light. He had a great battle in the Cham-
pagne with the Randwick-trained Heroic
colt The Marne, who should develop
into a useful miler.

E. T. O’Sullivan, who went to
America with the late Les Darcy and
later crossed to England to meet with
success as a racing trainer, has been a
good buyer at the Sydney yearling sales.
He intends to remain here, and has
secured stabling at Randwick.

S. Masters, who paid 1125 guineas for
a Windbag colt at the Victorian yearling
sales and 1000 guineas for a son of
Heroic at the Sydney sales, is to train
the youngsters for A. G. Crofts, a busi-
nessman of Melbourne. Master trains
at Flemington. It is Crofts’s first venture
on the turf.
* * * *
The Sydney yearling sales opened
briskly with a larger attendance of buyers
than has been seen for some years. Bid-
ding was keen on the opening day, but
dropped off on the second and third,
though high-quality youngsters brought
good prices. A feature of the three days’
sales was the demand for Heroic stock.
Twenty-one of these were sold for 11,060
guineas, averaging 527 guineas. Heroic
also scored the top price of the sales, a
chestnut colt out of the imported Cohesion
bringing 1000 guineas on the opening day,
and two others, from Shepherd Princess
and Tresseith respectively, selling at 1100
guineas each. Brazen, The Buzzard and
Marconigram, all imported sires, also
scored. This is the first lot from The
Buzzard to face the sale ring.

versatile for Martin Bucht in the Leich-

Bucht look sick. Recovering between

Ins ardf Outs
“Tenth Slip”: It seems definite enough
that the Australian Eleven will come
back direct from Britain at the termina-
tion of its tour. There had been some
idea of returning through the United
States and playing a match or two there,
as so many of the team’s predecessors
have done. It had been left to the
players, with the proviso that a unani-
mous decision must be made. Consulta-
tion on the Orford didn’t bring about
that result, so the original programme,
which demands that the team leave Eng-
land by the Orontes on September 29,
stands.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: One of the bitterest
complaints voiced by the barrackers for
the unhappy lads lately shanghaied by
the Board of Control to play cricket in
England for a measly £6OO for six months
has been that they have to suffer contra
exchange rates on the portion of the
£6OO paid them in Australia to carry
them to England. That they will receive
the benefit of British exchange on the
much larger sum they will accumulate in
Britain has been ignored. I use the word
“accumulate” advisedly. Apart from the
fact that every expense is paid, these
amateurs are snowed under throughout
the tour by gifts' from all and sundry. One
player of writer’s acquaintance received
on the last tour baksheesh pens, pipes,
rugs, gramophones, cameras, suits, guern-
seys, flannels, hats, boots, pottery, cricket,
tennis and golf gear, and other articles
too numerous to mention. He didn’t
have to buy extra bags to pack the stuff
in even. They were supplied like the
rest of the magpie hoard.
* * * *
“Five Ways”: Politicians are notori-
ously rocky on reminiscence. One is
George Lansbury, leader of the Opposi-
tion in the Commons. He told an Eng-
lish interviewer recently that he had
worked, during his days of travail in
Australia, on the beginnings of the Bris-
bane Cricket Ground, on which was
played “the first, or one of the earliest”
Tests. George added that he had
left Australia to return to his home-
land over 50 years ago, which is O.K.
Brisbane Cricket Ground began to be
carved out of an area of derelict land
in South Brisbane in 1896, so George
couldn’t have worked on it, unless in the
spirit. As one of the original life members
who contributed cash to start the ground,
writer can claim personal knowledge of
the subject. Further, the first Test match
in Australia was played in Melbourne
in 1877. The first Brisbane saw was in
1928, and that was on the Exhibition
Ground.
* * * *
“Scottie” hoots vigorously:
As a Scot marooned in your misgoverned
land, I reply to “Tadcaster” (B. 28/3/’34).
He infers that the Australian Eleven when
on its Scottish tour will find the locals
shy of shouting. Let me tell the mis-
guided Yorkshireman that probably 10 out of
the 11 of any Scotch cricket team are genuine
amateurs. “Tadcastei” may have lived so long
in Australia that he doesn’t know what that
means. The genuine Scotch amateur is, as a
rule, far from well off, and he gets little prac-
tice, as it always rains in Scotland. In spite
of that, he will gladly spend a hundred times
more of his own money than any of the Aus-
tralian shamateurs in entertaining. Not only
that —he won’t cable excuses if he’s beaten.
Foofcbrawl
“Jolimont”: The return of the “flick”
pass to Australian Rules football spells
trouble. Before its abolition every umpire
interpreted the rule in a different manner,
and the nerves of players were corre-
spondingly jangled. All the States had
their own views on the subject, and this
again tangled things up. Furthermore,
the rule lent itself to surreptitious rough
stuff. Trying a “flick” out of a hot ruck
a player not infrequently missed the ball
and landed the love-tap on the jaw of
an opponent. It was almost impossible
to prove that the miss was intentional,
and retaliation in kind often followed.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Every year as the Austra-
lian Rules football season approaches a
bitter cry goes up from the weaker foot-
ball States, because the best and brightest
of their football fodder is abducted by
one or other of the wealthy Melbourne
clubs. Many attempts have been made
to stop this poaching, but nothing beyond
a gentlemen’s agreement has ever been
arrived at, and that has always gone the
way of such things. South Australia,
which suffers more than its contem-
poraries from the Cabbage Garden’s kid-
napping proclivities, is to move at the
next meeting of the Australian Council
that a transfer fee of £lOO be levied on
any club in another State trying in the
future to get away with another’s ewe
lambs.
* * * $
“Old Cap”: One of the features of the
coming Rugby Union season in N.S.W.
is the rush of players from the League to
the Union code. In many cases this
followed on the rebirth of the Parramatta
district club, hundreds of youngsters in
that part of the world having no other
football available but junior League. So
many applications came from this dis-
trict that the protests and appeals com-
mittee of the R.U. had to break its rule
of reviewing applicants in the R.U.
rooms and journey to the trials at Parra-
matta to whitewash the repenting sinners
en masse. Other instances have been
applications from players prominent in
the Union who went over from reasons
of pique or hopes of profit. It is ques-
tionable whether the Union’s policy of
giving such deserters another chance is
justified. Some are only returning
because they could do no good for them-
selves at the other game.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Rugby Union’s golden-
jubilee season will be one of the busiest
ever entered on. Apart from the club
games, which start on April 14, the All
Blacks will be in N.S.W. and Queens-
land. They open against N.S.W. Western
Districts at Dubbo or Wellington on
August 1, and tackle N.S.W. in Sydney
on August 4 and 6. The first of the two
matches against Australia will be in
Sydney on August 11, and then the
tourists go to Brisbane for a couple of
matches against Queensland, taking on
Newcastle on the way back. The second
Test with Australia on August 25 ends
the tour. It has been decided to give
Victoria a money grant instead of a
game. This is a policy of doubtful wis-
dom, for the presence of the famous
Maorilanders in Melbourne, where
Rugby is going ahead by leaps and
bounds, would have had a better effect
than any amount of money. Victoria
plays N.S.W. in Sydney on June 2, while
another Ma State side will be playing
Queensland a couple of matches in Bris-
bane. Queensland has three matches in
N.S.W. between June 30 and July 7.
* * * *
“Gate”: Rugby League kicks off, as
far as N.S.W. is concerned, with a match
on April 21 between a team of Kan-
garoos and N.S.W. at Sydney Sports
Ground for the benefit of J. J. Giltinan,
one of the introducers of the code to
Australia. The grade competitions begin
on Anzac Day. There was talk of bring-
ing a team from Maoriland to offset the
Union All Blacks, but it was agreed that
the calibre of the professionals in the
Shivery Isles didn’t even justify steerage
passages. The annual tussles with
Queensland will be the star events. Ma
will trip to Brisbane and there will be
three games in Sydney, the two big ones
at Sydney Cricket Ground on June 2
and 4. This is the first time for five
years an inter-State League match has
been played on the big arena.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: N.S.W. Rugby
League last week put an extra coat of
paint on the lily and replated refined
gold. In other words, it actually drew
up rules for professionalism on the lines
of those which have always stood for
the Rugby Union’s confession of faith.
In future any Rugby League player re-
ceiving payment in money or kind, etc., for
playing football is a professional. The joke
lies in the fact that ever since the North-
ern Union broke away in the North of
England and began to pay its players the
N.U. or League game has been a pro-
fessional one in the eyes and under the
laws of all reputable amateur sport
organisations. The matter of receiving
money or reward of any kind does not
matter one iota. The code is officially
a professional one, and players and offi-
cials alike are professionals and rated
as such by the International Amateur
Federation.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: After some negotiations
it has been decided that the Australian
Davis Cuppers will meet Japan in their
opening match on an English grass court,
which should be all to the good from
our point of view. The Paris hard courts
were suggested, but Germany and France
will be meeting there on the same dates.
If not played on the centre court at
Wimbledon, Queen’s Club, in London,
will probably be the convincing ground.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: The Americans have
selected a formidable five for the Davis
Cup, though only four are to be called
on to play. The quintette is Stoeffen,
Lott, Shields, Wood and Allison. Of
that lot only Allison was in Australia last
year. Vines and Gledhill are now pro-
fessionals and Van Ryn has been passed
over. All except Stoeffen have had
plenty of Davis Cup experience, and he
has been a prominent performer in
American tennis and at Wimbledon.
Shields was in rare form last season,
among his wins being one over Lott in
the final of the Canadian championships.
Wood has always had a warm supporter

“Centre Court”: Those who were look-
ing forward to seeing the infant pheno-
mena, McGrath and American Frank
Parker, clashing in the Davis Cup have
been disappointed by the omission of
Parker from the Yankee team. However,
his supporters in the States are arranging
to send the youngster to Wimbledon, so,
with a bit of luck, they may yet meet.
The Australian owes the other lad a
payback, Parker having downed him a

The annual tennis match for the Niall
Cup between the Australian universities
was played in Sydney and won by
Sydney Uni., which scored 16 rubbers
to five against Melbourne in the finals.
These two easily overcame Queensland
and Adelaide, the former emerging from
the tussle the more or less proud pos-
sessor of the wooden spoon. This is the
first time for nine years that Melbourne
has dropped the trophy.
The Nineteenth Hole
Maoriland and Australian golfers were
shocked to hear of the death in an aero-
plane accident near Sydney of Dr. Lee
Brown. He was a graduate of Sydney
University and a Macquarie-street
specialist. Only 39, he lived largely for
golf, outside his work. He was a member
of the Australian Golf Club for years,
captained the A-grade team and was a
member of one successful N.S.W. Kirk-
Windeyer side. A great driver with
wood and irons, he was apt to fail
through nervousness on the putting
greens, as many another high-class player
has been prone to do.
* * * *
“Imphm”: If any golf widower desires
to check wifely explanations of long
absences from home, he is recommended
to the “Year Book” of the Australian
Ladies’ Golf Union. This record of
associate golf activities was compiled by
Rene Austin, secretary of the A.L.G.U.
Statistics of all State and national cham-
pionships are set out, and the lists of
leading players taking part regularly in
important golfing events add to the value
of the book.
* * * *
“Corbie”: Whether it is a question of
birds of a feather need not be gone into,
but predatory feathered fowls are un-
commonly thick in Canberra, with mag-
pies and crows in the lead. The Can-
berra golf tournament at Easter promised
to be wrecked by the crow contingent
which early started getting down on the
balls. In desperation the secretary armed
himself with a shotgun which lay on the
table whereat he received custom in the
shape of post entries, but even this was
ineffectual. At intervals the secretarial
duties were abandoned while the harassed
official rushed out with the gun, only to
see a derisive crow making, well out of
range, for the blue horizon. The trouble
came to an end when the crows got
bored with the sport, but there were no
casualties on either side.
Hs * Hi Hi
V. S. Richardson, of N.S.W., profes-
sional champion of Australia, added a
couple more victories to his long list
when he took the open championship of
the Federal Territory at the Canberra
Easter tourney, and added the profes-
sional title to it. It was a great finish
in the open, and the winner only got
home by a stroke from the local crack,
Petterson, of Royal Canberra. The
amateur championship was won by
young Waterson, the Moore Park player
who was runner-up to Hattersley in the
last N.S.W. amateur championship.
Hattersley held both the open and
amateur F.T. titles, but this time failed
to stay the course.
* H= * *
“Ainslie”: Golfers invading the sylvan
fastnesses of Canberra for the Easter
tournament found them unexpectedly
entertaining. Perhaps the star turn was
provided by an incredibly ancient hermit
who lives in a tiny tin hut close to one
of the fairways. Ever since the club was
started efforts have been made to induce
or compel the old gentleman to shift his
pitch, but the law is on his side and
neither financial nor any other blandish-
ments will move him. When, after regu-
lar play became the order of the day, the
recluse’s windows were periodically shat-
tered by pulled or sliced shots, it was
hoped that he would see reason. He
just substituted brown paper for glass and
carried on, Whenever a ball whizzes
through one of his window-panes or
bumps off his tin hermitage, the old
gentleman comes out and gives those
present and the wide world his opinion
of golfers in general, and- the Canberra
breed in particular. Nothing so rich
has yet been heard in Parliament itself,
and it is rumored that several prominent
members of both Houses have approached
the eremite with a view to taking lessons
from him.
* * * *
“Brassey”: The decision of the N.S.W.
golf authorities to hang up the Kirk-
Windeyer Cup contests with Maoriland
indefinitely (B. 28/ 3/’34) has roused a
lot of criticism, but it is sound.
Ever since its inception this show
has been a flop. Originally intended
as a k.o. tourney between the All
Blacks and every Australian State, it
resolved itself, almost from the first, into
an exchange of visits between N.S.W.
and M.L. Inter-State jealousy is the
reason given for the stand-off attitude of
other States, but that seems absurd. The
“That reminds me; the wife wants you over for a game of ping-pong
to-morrow night.”
Victorian contention has always been
that an inter-Dominion contest of this
nature should be a matter for the Aus-
tralian controlling body, and not for
that of one State, and, outside N.S.W., I
fancy that is the general opinion.

“Hoylake”: The annual golf match
between Oxford and Cambridge avenged
the boatrace debacle, the Dark Blues
winning by games to 6+. The match,
played at Formby in Lancashire, pro-
vided at least one sensation. Jamie-
son, Cambridge’s skipper, last year beat
his opposite number, Moss, with the
staggering card of 13 up and 11 to play.
Finishing the morning round, he was 4
up and went on to 8 up and 10. By this
everyone had gone home but Moss.
He went after his man, and, reeling off
hole after hole, had the result of the
match dependent on the last. Here he
holed out in four, and Jamieson, with a
7ft. putt to win, managed to turn the
trick.
Car and Cycle
“Oh, Yeah?”: In the U.S.A. recently
an express train and a car nego-
tiated a level-crossing at the same
time. When the train was pulled up, her
crew picked the bonnet and front wheels
oft the cowcatcher and walked back to
collect what might be left of the car’s
passengers. These were found, rather
flabbergasted but quite unharmed, still
sitting in the body of the car. The latter
was standing upright with the bonnet
and front wheels cut off as with a guillo-
tine, but with windscreen and windows
unbroken!

“Make and Break”: Last month saw
the 50th anniversary of spark ignition
for internal-combustion engines, the man
who patented the idea being Gottlieb
Daimler, in conjunction with Wilhelm
Maybach. Before March, 1884, there
were many weird devices fo.r obtaining
ignition of the cylinder charge. One
that was in general use in the earlier
cars was the “hot tube.” The tube, usu-
ally of platinum, took the place of the
modern sparking-plug, and had to be
heated to whiteness by a kerosene lamp,
which was part of the gadget, before the
engine could be got to function. A
long, dirty and blasphemous job, as a
rule.

“Whizz”: The English driver Cobb,
who seems to confine himself to attempts
on Brooklands records nowadays, added
to the wearisome list last week by putting
up new figures for one lap of the track.
Though handicapped by a 40 m.p.h. gale
across the track, he was credited at the
finish with a speed of 139.71 m.p.h. The
strain of driving in the gale, coupled
with the bitter wind, tied the driver up
so badly that he had to have his hands
prised off the wheel at the finish. His
best circuit was the third, in which the
2i miles took 71.3 sec.

“Kick Starter”: Queensland motor-
cyclists, who have been frothing at the
mouth for years because the Australian
motor-cycle heads have stubbornly re-
fused to stage an Australian T.T. or
championship race for the puffing-
billies in the land of the banana, are
bucked over the victory of Anderson,
who won the Australian T.T. for the
State at Bathurst the other day. They
are arguing that, with a champion who
put up record time for the run and beat
into the bargain T, East, winner of the
T.T. at Phillip Island last year, their
claim to have one of the big events
staged on their Kingston circuit is un-
assailable.

“Fitzcray”: Victorian amateur push-
bikers decided two of their champion-
ships at the Thompson memorial track
at Woodend. R. Goodwin, of Coburg,
won the five-mile senior title in 12min.
41 2-ssec. This season he has taken the
mile and half-mile Victorian and the half-
mile Australian championships, making
his track championship tally since last
season 11 —two Australian and nine club
and State titles. L. Foster, of Mitcham,
won the junior five-mile in 12min. 36
l-ssec. He is a brother of Cyril Foster,
a former amateur road champion of Aus-
tralia. Foster has also scored well in
the other junior championships, including
two Australian titles in Sydney last
season.
Miscellaneous
“Hotham”: “Jumbo” Sharland, now
broadcasting racing for the Melbourne
end of the A.8.C., is a lad of many parts.
A cricketer of note in his day —he scored
a century against Johnny Douglas’s team
in 1921 —he has also been in the cham-
pionship class at water polo. On top of
that he was a member of the famous
Geelong League football team and repre-
sented Victoria in the Australian game.
As a sporting organiser “Jumbo” has
raised some thousands of pounds for
charity, with the result that he is nowa-
days a life governor
of no less than three
Melbourne hos-
pitals.

“The Gaffer”:
The Stawell Gift,
last survivor of the
big pro f e s sional
130 yd. Sheffield
handicaps once
common throughout
Australia, was won
on Easter Monday
by Lewis Roberts, a
N.S.W. farmer. He
won off the 9fyd.
mark in 11 9-16 sec.,
which makes his run
4-Jyds. better than
evens. Roberts, who
went out at 3 to 1
on, had the money
piled on him, and
must have landed a
poultice in wagers,
though none of the
10 bagmen fielding
would lay him long
after the betting
opened. The Gift
itself is the richest
purse in profes-
sional running; the
cash end was £230
plus a gold trophy.
This was Roberts’s
second start in the
big event, though he
has won a fair
number of smaller
handicaps.
“Ride Off”: Melbourne advices say
that instead of the Australasian gold cup
tourney this year a Victorian centenary
polo tournament will be held, a special
pot being given for the affair. It will be
a scratch event, but a handicap match
or two may also be put on, the show
being staged between November 5 and
12. An Indian team is especially desired,
and Geoff. Ashton, who has been playing
in India and reached Sydney last week, is
expected to supply the polo authorities
at this end with the dinkum oil as to
the probability of an Indian visit.

This year five of the eights are rowing

“Over 40 Ailments

Constipation, indigestion,
stomach troubles, gastritis
rheumatism, neuritis, sciatica —
bladder weakness, catarrh, fre-
quent colds, headaches —lassi-
tude and poor appetite —all
these and more can be caused
by the clogging of the intes-
tines which gives rise to Self-
poisoning (Autoxima).
Nearly Everyone
Suffers
Self-poisoning is caused through
incomplete evacuation of the
bowels. Nearly everyone suf-
fers, even people of regular
habits. Modern foods and lack
of exercise give rise to a flabbi-
ness of the abdominal organs
which makes complete elimi-
nation almost impossible.
Fragments of food waste cling
to the intestinal walls and there
decay, breeding germs and poi-
sons which enter the blood-
stream. Self-poisoning is all
the more to be dreaded because
it is hidden and often unsus-
pected. The symptoms of self-
poisoning are always apparent,
however. Skin blemishes, those
frequent headaches, fits of
“blues,” the strange lassitude
and weakness which prevent
you from entering fully into
the enjoyment of life all point
to you being a victim.

The latest allegation is that Stavisky
had planned to release the convicts on
Devil’s Island, French Guiana, and to
form a corps known as “Stavisky’s Own”
to overpower the garrison. It is quite
possible. The eminent financier’s last
letters to his wife suggest that he had
acquired most of his education at the
pitchers, and was making a close study
of the aims and ideals of the American
gangster.

“P. 8.1.”: I read in the cablegrams that
the hostility of orthodox Hindus is likely
to prevent further consideration by the
Central Legislature of Hind of the bill
to enforce the admission of untouchables
to Hindu temples. It is stated that the
reason for abandoning the Gandhi-
inspired thing is that it infringes age-old
customs. It goes further than that. Its
passing would stultify the solemn under-
taking given when the Crown took over
India from John Company in 1858 that
the religious beliefs and customs of the
people would not be interfered with.
Even the Congress, which denies all faith
in things British, goes on in the serene
confidence that the pledge will never be
broken while the British hold the reins
in India.

“Maorilander”: Shaw thinks we ought
to give up our habit of calling the British
Isles “Home.” “I call England ‘home,’ ”
says G. 8.5., “because I live there and
make a living there. If I had persisted
in regarding Ireland as my home I might
have shared the fate of Sir Roger Case-
ment.” That begs a question as to how
far Bernard would let his opinions en-
danger his skin—there never was a
Fabian who did —but it doesn’t affect the
point. It was left to an English (or, as
he prefers to say, a Scottish) visitor to
protest. Lord Wemyss wrote a long lettei 4
to Wellington “Dominion,” the burden
of which was that references to Britain
as “Home” by Maorilanders were among
his pleasantest impressions. Strange
thing about it all is that neither Shaw nor
Wemyss heard the term used at any
public reception. It owed its currency at
the time of their visit to a P. and O.
newspaper advertisement —“Home, via
Suez”—which evidently was drafted in
Blighty, since the newspapers, the poli-
ticians and practically all other publicists
haven’t used “Home” as a synonym for
Britain for 20 years.

“Mells”: It is supposed to be increas-
ingly difficult to get reasonably distin-
guished Englishmen for State Governor-
ships, partly owing to the salary having ’
become a “tight fit” for a man without
private means, and partly because of the
lessened importance of the job. Notwith-
standing this, Downing-street manages
to be pretty well served ; friction of late
years between the gentlemen who occupy
Government House and their political
advisers is much less frequent than in the
old days. Lang certainly managed to
make things unpleasant for both De Chair
and Game, but his tactics ended in his
own undoing and the electors’ verdict was
“Serve him right.” Strickland, who re-
presented the Crown in three States in
succession, was the last Governor of a
prickly nature; Macartney was perhaps
the last to be mildly rapped on the
knuckles by the Colonial Office for mak-
ing it a condition of a Labor Adminis-
tration that it should go to the country
as soon as it was formed. Things are
different from the old days, when Gov-
ernors were occasionally burned in effigy.

“Shep”: Touching the heinous offence
of neglecting to salute (B. 21/3/’34).
Edinburgh was one of the happy hunting-
grounds of raiding M.P. of all sorts, but
our own were the worst of all. Two
of us were pulled by these sleuths for
failing to salute one of our own officers,
who considerately wheeled around and
swore down the Jacks’ throats that we
had saluted him, threatening immediate
trouble for them if they persisted in say-
ing we hadn’t. Less than a week before
we had both been in the hell of Bulle-
court, where saluting was no asset to a
man’s efficiency. But we hadn’t done
with that trio of Jacks, who deliberately
followed us around for hours, waiting a
chance to grab us again. To foil them
we saluted everything in sight, but were
eventually pulled up again by one of our
persecutors for missing an officer who
actually never existed. The other two
were a little further on examining passes.
It looked as if we would be done
for when they came up. Fortunately, a
car was going slowly past, and its solitary
occupant signed to us to jump in. We
made a rush for it, so did the Jack, but
a belt from my mate sprawled him on
the road. People nowadays believe that
the hatred of M.P. by line troops was
exaggerated. It wasn’t.

THE STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL.
FAT LAMBS AT THE ROYAL.
“Murrawong”: An interesting exhibit
to fat lamb breeders at the Sydney R. A.
Show were the dressed carcasses of the
Downs mutton experiment recently car-
ried out by the N.S.W. Agricultural De-
partment. Southdown, Dorset Horn and
Ryeland rams were each mated with (a)
merino, ( b ) comeback and (c) crossbred
ewes. The lambs were killed at 20 weeks
and the average dressed weights were as
follows:
Merino. Comeback. XB.
•iSouthdown .. 261 b. 32.661 b. 34.661 b.
Dorset Horn .. 34.661 b. 30.661 b. 38.661 b.
Ryeland .. 31.331 b. 351 b. 42.661 b.
One inference from the experiment is
that, of the Downs types, the Dorset
Horn mates best with the merino ewe.
The Ryeland is next, and the Southdown
shows the lightest carcass. ■ The come-
back crosses vary considerably, but here
the Ryeland begins to assert his early-
maturing qualities, which show them-
selves strongly when he is mated with
the crossbred ewe. The average dressed
weight of Ryeland-crossbred lambs —
42.661 b.—indicates that they would
have shown to even greater advantage
had they been slaughtered a month
earlier.
The wool from the Ryeland cross is
of good quality, with a more pronounced
crimp than that of any other Downs
breed. Pure-bred Ryeland wool has sold
remarkably well this year. One clip in
Sydney brought up to 22d. per pound,
and a Riverina Ryeland clip, sold in
Melbourne in February on a falling
market, averaged 20d. per pound, locks
included, which bears comparison with
some merino prices.
the Blowfly again.
“Lion”: “G.H.H.” (B. 21/3/’34) says:
“Why destroy carcass-breeding flies when
fly migration is unchecked?” Why not?
Every rotting carcass attracts flies at
once. Sheep near by stand a greater
chance of getting struck in consequence.
By destroying the carcasses breeding-
grounds are temporarily destroyed, too,
and with them a powerful fly-attracting
stink. As each million-odd maggots go
west, so must the blowfly menace be
lessened in proportion. “G.H.H.” can’t
refute that. It is the carcass-breeding
fly that actually kills the sheep, and when
dead it is the carcass which allows the
fly to mature, through feeding the
maggot. Does “G.H.H.” suggest that we
should allow any maggot to live that
could be destroyed?
Again “G.H.H.” says: “Carcass de-
struction kills relatively few visiting flies
and probably none of the local ones.”
This is bosh. When a maggot is de-
stroyed so is a potential fly. Even if
flies migrate and if we do not help our-
selves by carcass destruction we cer-
tainly help someone else, and also con-
siderably lessen the number able to
migrate.
Also, young maggots don’t live on the
sheep’s faeces, but on the sheep itself.
When a sheep gets hurt or develops a
sore (say) on the shoulder, the injury
invariably gets struck, and, although bac-
teria may have formed the pus in the
first place, “G.H.H.’s” theory won’t hold
water in this case, either.
WORMS IN SHEEP.
“Spot”: “Jumbuek” does not agree
with “Leo Lear” (B. 21/3/ ’34) that an
arsenical drench is too dangerous for
sheep. Neither do I, having used it for
eight years with good results and no
deaths. .
Bluestone has been proved by the Agri-
cultural Department to be the best dose
for worms in the intestines.
For lung worms in sheep, bluestone,
arsenic or any other drench given through
the mouth is useless. It goes straight to
the stomach and does not come in con-
tact with the lungs at all.
This formula is recommended by the
N.S.W. Agricultural Department for lung
worms:
Oil of turpentine 1 c.c.
Oil of creosote 0-5 c.c.
Chloroform .. 0-5 c.c.
Olive oil 2 c.c.
This is for a grown sheep, and may be
reduced by one-third for lambs.
The injection is given slowly into the
windpipe, about half-way down the neck,
with an ordinary 5-c.c. hypodermic
syringe.
“Egad” (B. 21 / 3 / ’34) hits the nail hard
on the head by advising regular drench-
ing for worms, so keeping the sheep
healthy. This is sound sense and it would
save us all a great deal of trouble if we
followed his example. I would like
to ask “Egad” if a quarterly mini-
mum is necessary. We drench regularly
each year once only, and I am coming to
the conclusion that it isn’t enough.
What I would like to find out is: How
often must it be done to avoid trouble
and what drench does “Egad” advocate?
We have been using bluestone and
mustard with successful results.
“W.D.Mc.”: “Jumbuck’s” drench (B.
21/3/’34) can be improved upon.
Arsenic-tobacco mixture is far better
and has stood the test of time for nearly
half a century. Here is the formula—
every sheepman should paste it in his
hat:
ljoz. arsenic.
J-lb. of tobacco (strongest possible).
2(lb. carbonate of soda.
Cut up tobacco and place in small bag.
Put arsenic and tobacco in an oil drum
and bring to the boil. Then add the soda,
taking care that it does not boil over,
which it will do if the boil is not checked
by adding cold water, a bucket of which
should be kept handy. Boil steadily for
one hour and keep well stirred. Be
sure not to allow it to boil over. When
finished boiling, strain and add water to
bring the quantity up to five gallons. It
will keep for any length of time in a
stone jar.
Dosage:
loz. for Jambs.
Hoz. for weaners.
2oz. for full-grown sheep.
For small lambs the operator must use
his own judgment. Repeat in ten days
if necessary. Yard the patients over-
night and keep at least six hours after
drenching without water.
“Jumbuck’s” drench contains too much
arsenic (20z.) and too little carb. soda
(20z.), and the carb. soda might as well
be left out for all the good it is. Two
and a half pounds is the correct quantity
of carb. soda to use—2oz. is of no use.
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.
“Valerin” : On average country “A 1 bar-
mount’s” (B. 28/3/’34) digging-out costs
are well within the mark, but how many
can pay them? I believe the decoy
system to be cheaper. I had 2300
acres badly infested with rabbits, and
they were well dug in. My estimate for
digging out was. £650. A man with a
“special decoy” said he would clean it
up for £5 per thousand rabbits and poison
found —no results, no pay. In a fortnight
he completed the job and I paid him for
9400 scalps. The strychnine cost me
£l2 ; total outlay, £59. Stock were not
removed from the paddocks and the
rabbit carcasses were left in piles ready
for burning. Two men with a pack of
dogs are mopping up any strays and
breaking in the burrows, on which Wim-
mera rye and sub. clover seed are being
scattered. This area will be cleaned up
for less than £lOO. I don’t know what
the decoy is, but to anyone interested I
can pass on the address of the decoy
expert.
TURNING WHEAT INTO WOOL.
“Granova”: At the s.-w. district
N.S.W. Agricultural Bureau Conference
recently, Mr. Dan Kelly, a veteran
farmer, suggested this method of turning
a wheat crop into wool.
Take 100 acres of wheat harvested for
grain. Average yield, say, 10 bushels.
Take 2s. 6d. as a probable average price
for wheat over the next three years.
Then, 16 bushels at 2s. 6d. equals £2
per acre. Gross return from 100 acres
equals £2OO.
Cut 100 acres of a similar crop for
hay. The yield would be 125 tons, and
lib. of goodrquality hay per day will
maintain a dry sheep in good health.
Therefore, 125 tons of hay would feed
1000 wethers for one year at lib. of
chaff per day. Take the average yield of
wool at 81b. and the price over next
three years 15d. per pound.
Eight pounds of wool at 15d. per
pound equals 10s. per sheep. Gross in-
come from sheep would, therefore, be
£5OO. The cost of cutting, stooking, cart-
ing and stacking hay would equal the
costs of harvesting and carting grain.
Mr. Kelly suggested a mechanical
device made from an old stripper for
distributing the chaff, and a cheap method
of making troughing out of old sacks and
wire. The costs of chaffing and feeding
the sheep, interest and losses would pos-
sibly amount to £l5O per year. This
would still leave a margin of £l5O a
year in favor of the sheep proposition.
In a season like the present, a flock of
1000 wethers could be fed free for
months, as many small farmers are
clamoring for sheep to clean their fallows
and eat out stubbles which they are un-
able to burn.
Every few years it is possible occa-
sionally to buy sound, young sheep very
cheaply.
A Government veterinary officer
present mentioned the possibility of
worm infestation, but said that if the
sheep were allowed to feed off a small
patch of green crop occasionally they
would maintain fair health.
SHEEP ON SHARES.
“H.C.M.”: “Valerin” (B. 7/3 / ’34)
doesn’t explain what will happen to
the sheep whilst the oats are growing
into grain, and afterwards. The stubbles
that had been stocked on to the farmer’s
property at the rate of three sheep to
the acre would not carry a thousand
sheep for the rest of the year (I am pre-
suming that one man finds the sheep
and that the other feeds them).
A better idea, to my mind, on similar
lines to “Valerin’s,” would be as follows:
A has surplus sheep, and arranges
with B to grow oats for them on
shares. They decide on the number that
can be depastured on B’s property
during the green period and afterwards.
A joins the ewes to long-wool rams,
and has them ready to lamb at the same
time that B has his crop ready to be
eaten off. Thus the oats will be ready
to aid in producing a fat lamb, which
should sell well this year. B will carry
the ewe and lamb to trucking time if
he can. It should be possible if he has
planted the oats in several paddocks, so
that one can grow up whilst the other
is being eaten off. It would mean a
heavy sowing of oats with plenty of
manure at B’s expense, and the only
fair way would be to divide the wool
and the lambs.
By this means A gets fat lambs as
an extra, his sheep fed for a large part
of the year, and a much better cheque.
B gets greatly improved land, and his
half of the proceeds should be better
than the crop could hope to be.
This seems to me to be a sound pro-
position, and fair to both parties, besides
returning a great deal more to A than
dry sheep could, and more to B than
the crop would.
When the oats were eaten out A
would have to carry the sheep again
until B got a fresh growth of feed.
PESTS.
“Riverina Grazier”: The increase of
noxious animals and weeds in the last few
years is a matter for grave concern. It is
hard to compute the toll they take, but it
must run into millions. Control of
rabbits and weeds is vested in Pastures
Protection Boards, shire councils, etc.,
and they have fallen down badly on the
job.
No serious effort is being made, for the
reason that there is no co-operation or
cohesion between the different boards or
even among members of boards them-
selves. Individual members of councils
and boards are afraid to tackle the job
because, in many instances, they are the
worst offenders. The man who tries to
do his duty incurs the wrath of the rate-
payers and is rejected.
Landholders who are spending money
in keeping their properties free of rabbits
and weeds realise that it is a losing game
unless their neighbors are compelled to
take similar action.
I have spent a great deal of money
fighting pests without much success. I
am also a member of local boards and
know their utter futility.
AXES AND THEIR CARE.
“Jarrah Jack”: For easy and clean
work the fall and condition of the head
are all-important. To get correct fall,
pick a handle with a good curve, and for
strength one free of notches and other
blemishes. In hickory and most Aus-
tralian woods look for one cut on the
back, i.e., for grain running true from
end to end. See that the wood is not
warped.
Get the head so that the cutting edge
runs in a straight line with the handle.
To gauge the fall, place the thumb on
toe and index finger on the heel of the
blade, and sight these two to line with
the knob on the end of the handle. Sink
the head in the eye right up to the
shoulder. Pick a blade with little weight
above the eye, and one that tapers in
wedge fashion from back to edge.
Sharpen flat with a file or a grind-
stone, so that when finished each side will
take a straight edge, and see that the
bevel on each side of the blade is the
same length. Give the toe and heel less
filing than centre. The flat-filed surface
makes the blade draw into the wood, and
the thicker toe and heel open the cut and
the blade comes away easier after
the blow. The harder the wood the
shorter the bevel. Finish the edge with
an axe stone without altering the blade
angle.
Always file away from you, and
your file will last. Also, cover your file
with paper when not in use, and keep
your hands off it as much as possible.
Give the axe handle a dressing of lin-
seed oil occasionally, and when not in
use keep it out of the sun and rain.
When resharpening first use an old file
to remove stains or rust from the blade,
then a new one.

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“Curlew”: A rapid wrench may be
made by welding a monkey wrench to
an old boring brace so that the jaws, of
the wrench are in the position formerly
occupied by the part that held the bit.
Screwing on a nut is done exactly the
same way as boring.
“G.J.A.S.”: To cleanse the hands of
machine grease, crumple a newspaper
and pour kerosene over it. Then use it
like a towel. A rinse in soap and water
will do the rest.
“Strenuous”: To prevent rust in stored
tools, grease bright steel surfaces with
petroleum jelly, 3 parts, and lysol, 1
part. Mix well, and rub well into the
pores of the steel.
“Mombak”: This packing for the
stuffing-boxes of pumps will’last: Trim
back the wool on an inch strip of sheep-
skin to about one inch staple and saturate
it in gear oil (not heavy grease). Pack
the strip around the rod, wool inside, and
screw down lightly. An occasional half-
turn will keep a watertight joint.
“A.J.8.”: When preparing your sheep
drench for boiling, put it in a single-
piece cloth bag. Thus you can tell when
all your drench is dissolved, and you are
sure there is none stuck on the side of
your bucket. There is no need to stir
when boiling.
“Stacker”: A dodge from an old hay-
maker:—From the base to the top of
the stack have a length of 6in. down
pipe, well pierced with holes up the sides,
and with a hooded top like a stovepipe.
Place the pipe in position and build the
stack round it. It will carry off all cen-
tral heating or dampness.
“Eyelet”: Tie the ends of your tent
ropes to 4in. rings cut from heavy inner
tube. Place these around pegs or poles.
The rubber compensates for rope shrink-
age through dew or rain, and absorbs
the strain of wind which shortens the
tent life by tearing seams and pulling
eyelets out. No matter what the weather
the tent is always taut with these fittings.
“Sandy”: The strap-iron round wool
bales will make cheap traces which don't
chafe the horses’ sides. A |-iron “D”
with link is fastened to the hames end
by bending the strap-iron around and
riveting with two rivets. Links with
swivel and a hook for an eye-bolt in
swing are attached to the other end. The
hames are suitable for binder, drill and
plough.
“R.J.H.C.”: A round cigarette- or
tobacco-tin makes a good cream aerator.
Punch about a dozen evenly spaced holes
1-16 in. diameter in the bottom (more or
less, according to size of separator). File
off the rough edges underneath. Then
attach a well-balanced handle with a
piece of fine wire, and hang this tin by
a small “S” hook to a hole in the top
rim of the separator cream spout. Any
varnish on the tin can be removed with
caustic soda.
“W.D.Mc.”: When feeding the dairy
herd-on green oats, maize or millet, do
not spread it on the ground to have the
half of it spoiled by feet and manure.
Get a piece of rabbit netting (42in. for
preference) and thread a length of No,
8 fencing wire through each edge. Then
strain up tight and horizontally between
two trees or four stout posts well stayed
—put two posts on each side to keep
the netting from sagging in the centre.
You will then have a good feeding rack
on which the cows can feed from either
side of clean fodder with no waste.
“G.J.A.S.”: To make handy bowls for
any farm purpose, line an enamel toilet
basin with a smooth inside surface with
a piece of lin. mesh wire-netting pressed
down neatly to fit. Flatten all creases
in the netting and trim off below
the edge of the mould. Mix one part
cement and three parts clean sifted sand,
and line the basin to thickness required,
forcing the mixture well through the net-
ting. Smooth off the inside surface and
edge with an oval-bottomed 2oz. to-
bacco-tin dipped in water. When the
mould is set, and before it is quite dry,
turn it out on to a board and place it in
the shade, covered with a damp bag, to
harden.
“Tac”: To move a weighty dead
animal or heavy posts or beams use
horse and dray. Bore a fin. hole in the
floor of the dray and draw a length of
No. 8 wire through to clear the axle.
Fasten the end of the wire under and
round the object to be moved. Connect
the other end with an ordinary
wire-strainer, supported by two chocks
immediately above the hole, and strain
until one end of the burden is lifted tight
against axle. Now secure the load to
the axle with a trace- or drag-chain, after-
wards slacking the wire, though leaving
in position to again release the load
when required. Beams 30ft. in length
may be easily moved by an intelligent
farm boy in the manner described.
“W.S.”: For sore udders arising from
sweat boils, cracking, etc., which afflict
cows during the flush of their milking
season, or for cuts and abrasions to teats,
pure goanna oil is an infallible and rapid
cure. First bathe with hot water and dis-
infectant, then massage liberally with the
oil. Repeat the treatment at each milk-
ing. I have had cows suffering from
both severely lacerated and extensively
erupted udders which, under the treat-
ment, were completely cured in a few
days. To get the oil, strip the fat from
the flanks of the goanna, place it in a
bottle and stand it in the sun. After it
is melted down, pour off a few times into
fresh bottles as the heavier matter preci-
pitates.
“Gumnuts”: I agree with “Heresone”
(B. 31/1/’34) that native trees stand
heavy lopping and give a better shade
afterwards than uncut trees. However,
this is generally not the case with that
invaluable fodder tree the mountain oak.
If all the green foliage is lopped off old
trees, they generally die, but hardy young
trees sometimes recover. This tree is
also easily killed by heat, and quickly
dies when a fire approaches within six
feet of the trunk.
“G.L.1868”: Re growing saltbush in
Victoria (B. 31/l/’34). In the 1860’s the
plant was common on the lower Avoca
and along the southern fringe of the
Mallee —in the drought of 1869 pretty
well everything was eaten out in the
north. My experience is that saltbush
would only pay to grow on very cheap
land, as it will only stand light stocking.
The first plant of saltbush I ever saw
was growing in the garden of Thos. Phil-
lips in Market-square, Inglewood. Vic-
torian saltbush grows readily from cut-
tings. In wet districts it is not relished by
stock.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Most profitable citrus fruit to grow in Mac-
kay (Q.) district ? 1 have good scrub loam soil
well drained. Would it be advisable to plant
citrus trees between bananas so that they would
be well established when the bananas are fin-
ished ? Please take into consideration both
local and overseas markets. —ssB.
The most favored varieties of oranges to
grow are Washington Navel, Joppa and White
Siletta for early market, and Valencia Late for
the late market. The market for citrus now
is not all that could be desired in view of the
big surplus, though export trade may improve.
Queensland citrus matures some weeks earlier
than southern fruit, so that early in the season
local growers get a better return. Citrus trees
may be .planted between bananas.
I have an avenue of sturdy sugar gums about
five years old. lam concerned to find that
from the twigs and leaves of some of the trees
hundreds of little grey bags—some nearly two
inches long—are hanging. These bags are made
of a tough grey webby material, and each con-
tains a black-looking grub, mostly sleek and
fat. Many leaves are mutilated, only the tissues
being left. What shall I do ? —751.
The trees are apparently attacked by case
moth grubs ( Psychidee ). The simplest treat-
ment would be to spray the foliage, using lib.
of lead arsenate powder to 35 to 40 gallons
of water. This would poison the caterpillars
in the bags and not burn the foliage.
Best way to prepare for banana-growing on
a slightly marshy block of land ? The ground
is thickly covered with grass. Will the ground
have to be sweetened ? With what, and what
quantity per acre ? Is ploughing the grass the
only way to get rid of it ? Textbooks on
banana-growing ? —739.
The planting of bananas on marshy ground
is not advised, as the banana requires a well-
drained area to be successful. This type of
land will be cold in winter, and the banana,
being a tropical fruit, will not be satisfactory
under such conditions. Leaflets on Banana
Growing can be obtained from the Department
of Agriculture, Sydney or Brisbane.
What is a simple method of rendering dam
water suitable for drinking ? —520.
Clearing chemicals placed in an ordinary
earth dam rarely give satisfaction. The pro-
cess of clearing must be carried out in a gal-
vanised-iron, wooden or concrete tank.
Wooden barrels may also be used. The pro-
cess is as follows: Alumino ferric is added to
the muddy water —lib. to 3000 gallons. The
treated water is sprinkled or sprayed on the
surface of the water to be cleared. The water
is then stirred and well mixed with a stick or
pole and then allowed to stand undisturbed for
several hours. The “time of standing” varies
with different waters. After some time the
material causing the turbidity slowly settles to
the bottom. Alumino ferric may be obtained
from W. Adams and Co., Ltd., 175 Clarence-
street, Sydney. The price is about 2s. per
pound.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Making for Ourselves
lhe story of almost any Australian
manufacturing enterprise before the war
was a sad one. The early struggles of
Meggitt, James Fielding and Co., most
of the textile mills and many other
pioneers of Australian-made products
brought anguish to the hearts of share-
holders that takes some of the gloss off
any later prosperity. In pre-war years
there were no B.H.P. steelworks, no tex-
tile mills of the size we know to-day,
the rubber-processing industry was in its
infancy, and Holdens had not yet started
to make motor-car bodies.
True, Walkers, in Maryborough (Q.),
had been turning out railway engines and
other machinery for many years. H. V.
McKay had already established a reputa-
tion for the products of his Sunshine
works. Beale pianos and the Ipswich
woollens were well-known throughout
Australia. But it was the war that gave
Australian manufacturers their first big
opportunity.
Australian Knitting Mills grew by leaps
and bounds, and floated Yarra Falls.
Wunderlichs went ahead, B.H.P. com-
menced to grow up ; the popularity of
motor-cars meant growth in the tyre
and body-building trades.
There were some disappointments.
Standard - Waygood’s heavy - electrical
enterprise did not receive the deserved
support from Government bodies, and
closed down. The original Hadfields
steel-making concern was not a financial
success. George A. Bond’s concern
appeared to flourish for some years, then
wilted at the first onset of slump.
In 1910 the value of output in all Aus-
tralian factories was £48,100,000. By
1929 it was up to £420,445,000. In 1932
it had fallen to £281,645,000 —the drop
in prices was partly to blame, but there
has since been a recovery. In compari-
son, the value of agricultural, pastoral
and mineral production rose from
£142,380,000 in 1910 to £288,400,000 in
1929. In 1932 it was down to
£198,400,000. Here, also, there has been
a recovery.
To-day, though depression and com-
petition have kept a curb on profit-mak-
ing in many cases, the factory activity
of Australia compared with a decade ago
is remarkable. Imports had to be cut
down in order to keep our overseas
finances on an even keel; Scullin’s tariff
and the exchange operated in this direc-
tion. Silk stockings and underwear,
worsteds, fine woollen dress materials,
corsets, electrical fittings, stoves and
baths, cigarettes, motor-tyres, felt hats,
steel products, sporting goods, food
products and medicines under overseas
trade-names—if the local market is large
enough, in nearly every instance these
lines are now made in Australia. The
revival in gold-mining has also helped
machinery-makers, such as Ruwolts and
Goninans.
The textile industry is particularly
active, and employs a large number of
hands. Yet it is a long time since under-
wear and hosiery have been so cheap.
Motor-tyres are down, and so are fer-
tilisers and cement. The Australian in-
vestor is interested to the extent of mil-
lions of pounds in such industries. The
value of fixed assets at work grew from
£102,000,000 in 1919 to £236,000,000 in
1931.
Bond Companies
From F. T. Smythe, F.1.C.A., liqui-
dator of Australian and N.Z. Invest-
ments, Ltd.:
In your article on bond companies (B.
21/3/’34) you give the example of Anzil
Hempland Bonds, but the facts are not cor-
rectly quoted; if they were, they would abso-
lutely disprove your claim of shares being pre-
ferable to bonds as investments.
I had no connection whatever with Aust. and
N.Z. Investments (Anzil) prior to my pre-
sent appointment. The Equity Court found
that the “A” and “C” group bondholders
are entitled to their land, subject to
payment of balances due to land vendors. The
’ group is an absolute failure, caused
through reasons quite apart from whether capi-
tal was Jn the form of shares or bonds. In
the “B’' group a Ist debenture amounting
at date of liquidation to £1360 has to be dis-
charged, and a further Ist debenture of £7463
m favor of the Public Trustee has to be paid;
then, after adjustment of costs, the balance
becomes trust funds available to bondholders.
i.he Ist debenture-holders obtained their
priority in the “B” group only by subrogation
ot land vendors’ rights. Had the debenture-
money not been obtained the land vendor would
nave foreclosed, and the “B” group bond-
holders received nothing.
Shareholders will receive no return, and it
would appear that the 2nd debenture-holders
and ordinary creditors will be in a similar
position. If the funds had been subscribed in
the form of share capital, debenture-holders and
creditors would have prior claims.
Admittedly the bond system of financing re-
quires regulating legislation. But bonds have
come to stay, and The Bulletin could have
considerable influence in making them more
secure and better regulated by constructive
articles designed to assist the introduction of
the necessary regulating legislation.
The Bulletin can’t see where its
mention of Anzil disagrees with the
facts. Mr. Smythe shows how the “B”
group was mortgaged, and if the “C”
group (to which The Bulletin particu-
larly referred) was not actually mort-
gaged, the head vendor had a lien over
part of the land, which he later repos-
sessed. Mr. Smythe admits that the “C”
group was an utter failure, but says
bonds were not to blame. Actually,
this money (1963 “C” bondholders
paid in full to £2l 10s. each for
one-third acre lots planted with Phor-
mium tenax), which came in after the
“A” and “B” groups, was the first to be
acknowledged as gone, or nearly so.
It seems that a lot of the “C” bond-
holders’ money went in making up for
“They say backless costumes de-
pressed. the price of wool."
“Yes, but think how they cheered the boys up who came down for the Show.”
shortages in the “A” and “B” issues. If
the three groups had been financed by
shares instead of bonds all interested
would have ranked equally (and more
or less equitably) in what was left of the
wreckage.
Anzil’s bond-issue finance was so com-
plicated that some of the directors were
not fully aware of the mess the co. was
in until too late. To the credit of several
they put money of their own into the
shaking concern to try to save bond-
holders’ interests. It is plain that the
law should prohibit the issue of bonds
in respect of encumbered land.
Bond-issues often mean extravagant
selling commissions. They have enabled
shareholders to receive dividends before
bondholders become entitled to any pro-
fits at all. If bondholders have any direct
say in the management of a co. the whole
scheme becomes illegal. The law costs
in obtaining directions from the Equity
Court in the winding-up of Anzil must
have cost a pretty penny, too. On one
occasion Judge Harvey’s directions filled
two columns of the “S. M. Herald.”
The Bulletin’s whole objections have
been against bonds as they are, and not
as they might be. In these columns of
February 14 a special section under the
Companies Act was recommended. At
the present time bonds are an unknown
legal quantity; the investor usually
hasn’t the foggiest idea of what his
rights and obligations are.
Can the Exchange Rate Hold?
Though our exports of wheat, butter
and flour during the first eight months
of this financial year were down by
nearly £7,000,000 Australian, wool ship-
ments increased by £21,220,000, and re-
presented 52 p.c. of the aggregate exports.
Imports were slightly lower, and the
favorable trade balance mounted to
£33,446,000 sterling, of which the Feb-
ruary balance accounted for £5,027,000.
The imports side of the account revealed
that Australians have been indulging in
more overseas tea, whisky, carpets,
machinery and motor-cars. On the other
hand, cotton, linen and silk goods lost
favor. Also fewer cornsacks and less
petrol were imported. Among the exports,
raisins showed a jump of £730,000, hides
and skins £1,553,000, and sugar £782,000.
Preliminary figures for March suggest
that imports will show little growth over
February, but that exports will increase
slightly.
Altogether, it looks as though the year
will end with a surplus of nearly
£50,000,000 Australian. Who is going
to carry the surplus over and above our
interest requirements and pay £125 Aus-
tralian to the exporter for sterling?
* * * *
World wool prices during the slump
touched their lowest level in June, 1932.
The swing back definitely started 12
months ago. Taking the average price
between 1926-28 as representing 100, the
price of wool during 1930 was 65.1, that
of cotton 73.4, and rayon 63.1. Rayon
slipped further than wool in the suc-
ceeding months, and is still falling. Wool
recovered from 53 in Jan., ’33, to 81.8
in Jan., ’34 ; cotton from 56.7 to 62.4 ;
rayon dropped from 48.7 to 44.9. The
swing of the world’s demand from rayon
to wool, as evidenced by the trend of
prices, is very encouraging to the Aus-
tralian grower.
* * * *
“Bringelly”: Cool drinks were being
served for supper, and my host inquired,
“Are these the glasses that break them-
selves?” His wife said they were. “I
bought a dozen yesterday,” she explained
to me. “I washed them, stood them on
the table, and later heard a crash—one
was shattered to bits, though nothing
appeared to have touched it. I put them
on the sideboard, and while in the gar-
den heard another crash. Another one
was gone—it seemed to have exploded
or something.” The mystery was begin-
ning to grip me. I put my tumbler down.
“Hope the thing doesn’t burst while I’m
drinking from it,” I remarked dubiously.
Almost immediately a metallic “chink”
came from the direction of the tumbler
and the side burst out and splintered on
the tray. They were Japanese goods.
Don’t know why the whole stock hadn’t
burst on the voyage out; perhaps it re-
quired a cool liquid to set the infernal
things off.

“York-street Once’.’: Australia’s favor-
able trade balance is being watched with
anticipation by Bradford and Man-
chester. A writer in the “Financial.
Times”,says that “the need for vigorous
restriction of impprts no longer exists,
nor is it consistent with the spirit of
Ottawa policy. So far as British goods
are concerned, the market for Australian
pastoral, dairy and other products must
be governed by the ability of British
manufacturers to sell goods in Australia.
British purchases of Maoriland produce
are worth nearly four times as much as
the goods she sells to the Dominion.”
The position as regards Australia is not
quite so lopsided ; it must be remem-
bered also that most of Australia’s pur-
chases from Britain are for home con-
sumption, whereas part of the wool that
Britain buys from us is an essential raw
material in her exports, quite separate
from that actually consumed in. the Old
Country.

During the last financial twelvemonth
the returned soldiers and sailors operat-
ing the Geelong Woollen and Worsted
Co-op. mills wiped off their debt to the
Commonwealth. The Government lent
them £60,000 in two instalments. They
not only paid the interest regularly, but
have distributed excellent dividends. Pro-
bably the record would have been alto-
gether different had the Government
tried to run the mills itself.

Prior to 1933 very little British coal-
oil was used by the Royal Air Force.
During that year one squadron flew
solely on the fuel. Seven squadrons are
now using it. The Admiralty took 2000
tons during 1933.

Canada has imposed a dumping and
exchange duty on Maoriland butter. The
ordinary duty is calculated as if the M.L.
pound was at par, and a currency dump
equal to the difference between the de-
preciated value and par is levied. Similar
action was taken when the British pound
slumped. The Canadian-Maoriland
treaty of 1932 gave either Government
the right to impose such duties, pro-
vided they did not exceed the tariff on
similar goods from Great Britain.

South Australia once produced nearly
all the salt used in the Commonwealth, but
the working of deposits at Bowen (Q.) and
n.-w. Vic. has cut into the trade. Present
output in S.A. is about 60,000 or 70,000
tons a year—it once got up to 91,000
tons. Salt-licks for cattle have been in
less demand, owing to pastoral depres-
sion ; some revival is now looked for.
Production of alkali from reserve salt-
leases at St. Kilda has been suggested to
the Public Works Committee. There is
talk of reclaiming 2000 acres in the
district and the establishment of a plant
on Lefevre Peninsula. The comple-
tion of the Mt. Bold reservoir would
give an ample supply of water. Director
of Mines Ward mentioned that Imperial
Chemical Industries had shown interest
in the scheme, and that anything done
would have the co-operation of Aust a-
lian Salt Co. The doubt is whether the
Australian demand for alkali would war-
rant a local plant.

“Title”: Estimated that the world’s
sugar crop for 1933-34 will be 24,750,000
tons, an increase of 600,000 tons over
the previous year’s yield. This in spite
of the fact that, under the Chadbourne
scheme, production and planting were
considerably reduced —Cuba, for in-
stance, will produce half last year’s
output of five million tons. Java
has also reduced output heavily, but in
British India, the U.S.A., Philippines and
beet-sugar-growing countries of Europe
production has increased. Already, how-
ever, there are indications that, with a
low world price certain, consumption
will be accelerated.

“Mr. Weller”: Britain’s Chancellor of
the Exchequer at least should have a
good word for widows. Over a thou-
sand war widows married again during
the financial year and forfeited their pen-
sions, the Treasury benefiting by close
on £lOO,OOO. Another help to consoli-
dated revenue was that 46,500 war babies
reached the age of 16, and their allow-
ances ceased. The Pensions Ministry
has paid out £1,047,000,000 since its
inception.

The Piping Cassowary.
BY FREEMAN SANDOM.
CARL the Cassowary had found that
mud-baths gave a certain amount
of relief to his rheumatism. He
lived on the edge of an extensive mud-
flat, and when the tide was out there
was mud enough for a million rheumatic
cassowaries to take the cure.
Carl was the only cassowary in the
district, rheumatic or otherwise, but
there were others who recognised the
virtues of mud. Came a day when one
of these resented Carl’s presence in a
puddle-hole, and took steps.
When a crab measuring twelve inches
across the back, and endowed with claws
in proportion, takes steps, results follow.
The cassowary shot out of the mud
with a screech, and with flapping wings
proceeded along the beach at a pace
hitherto undreamed of in the district.
The crab clung grimly to his chosen spot
in the region of Carl’s tail feathers. In
his own good time he let go. But the
damage was done, and catastrophic
events followed.
The next day the ebb tide happened
to be one of the lowest on record. For
a mile out to the
dredged channel the
mud glistened in the
morning sun. From
his verandah the
cassowary’s owner
saw a curious sight.
He focussed a
powerful telescope,
removed it, rubbed
his eyes and tried
again.
A quarter of a
mile out Carl the
Cassowary was pro-
ceeding slowly to-
wards the channel,
mud squelching with
every step. In his
beak, was a bamboo
flute, held and mani-
pulated by his wing-
tips.
On the light puffs
of a sea breeze a
haunting melody
reached the shore.
It was charged with
the unutterable sad-
ness of life: yet it
possessed a compel-
ling sweetness which
seemed to tug and
tug at the heart,
calling upon the
owner to follow the
player.,
But behind the
musical Carl was
something which
made the watcher on
the verandah swear
softly and grow goggle-eyed.
Crabs! Armies of crabs trudging
along in files of seven.
Huge, black-backed mud-crabs with
formidable nippers, slender green and
white sand-crabs, tiny soldier-crabs with
one giant, red claw the size of the rest
of the body; in fact, every kind of crab
that inhabited the flat.
The marching army had already scored
deep ruts in the mud, and behind the
rearguard new recruits were constantly
flopping into these ruts and following the
veterans.
Flanking the marching throng were
thousands of mudjumpers (or tree-climb-
ing fish) keeping pace in wriggly jumps
by means of their claw-like breast fins.
Their goggle eyes, devoid now of their
habitual curiosity and animated instead
by a sad, sweet desire, seemed fixed on
the fluting cassowary.
“The Pied Piper of Hamelin!” mur-
mured the man on the verandah.
Above this extraordinary procession
hovered a dense cloud of seagulls, adding
a touch of the supernatural to the scene,
for instead of the incessant screeching
which these birds indulge in when a plen-
tiful supply of food is about there was
a deathly silence. The gulls flew in
ordered formation without the expected
swoop and dive for the easy prey below,
as if they took part in a funeral cortege.
That, indeed, is what it was. The
cassowary, thirsting for revenge, had hit
upon this method of ridding the flat of
crabs.
“He is making for the deep channel,”
thought the man with the telescope, “in-
tending to drown the crabs and so make
a clean-up with one swift, bold stroke.”
But drown crabs? It seemed to the
“What’s the idea of getting around like this ? Do you think you’re in
the audience?”
watcher that Carl had made a serious
miscalculation.
It is a curious thing that two beings
can live side by side for years and yet
be ignorant of each other’s possibilities.
The man had known Carl since the egg-
stage, and yet he had no inkling of his
real mental capacity.
It seemed to him a coincidence that the
suction-dredge, steaming down the
channel bound for Brisbane for its annual
overhaul, should stop and back against
the bank where the piping cassowary
had just arrived.
Being the master of the dredge, I knew
better. I was, of course, on the bridge
at the time, and obeyed the suggestive
wave of Carl’s right wing.
As the first rank of the crab army
arrived I gave the order which set the
machinery in motion. The dredge com-
menced to suck, and soon a continuous
stream of mud, mixed with a living,
squirming mass of crabs and mudjumpers,
began to flop into our empty hold.
Thousands? We must have shipped
hundreds of thousands of sizable crabs
in the course of the first hour, and still
they came. I began to be afraid of over-
taxing our capacity and waited anxiously
with my mouth to the speaking-tube.
Had we room for the rearguard, now
twenty yards away? It was touch and
go, for as the last crab came tumbling
in we were down to the Plimsoll-mark.
Stop!
I gave the order “Full ahead!”
Lurching heavily in the swell we
swerved and steamed for the open sea.
I waved farewell to Carl on the bank.
He had thrown away the flute and
was dancing a hornpipe as well as the
sticky mud would permit, the silent gulls
circling reverently over his bald head.
“Like a halo,” I thought.
It only remains to record that the
crabs kept well in the moist mud and,
feeding voraciously on the mudjumpers,
were in prime condition on arrival at
Brisbane. They fetched an excellent
price on the market, and the Harbor
Board was overjoyed to learn that the
cheque paid the heavy cost of the trip
and the annual overhaul.
Another blessing became apparent
later. The crabs had been a menace to
the fishermen on the mudflat, and their
removal endeared the cassowary to these
men. A movement to collect money for
a public testimonial to the fine bird was
started.
But, alas! Even as the committee
deliberated on the form the presentation
should take, Carl passed to his reward.
Blood-poisoning had resulted from the
crab-bite, and the sufferer, his resistance
sapped by the rheumatism already men-
tioned, dragged himself painfully into
Anzac Park to die.
And there, among the trees, the visitor
to Cairns will now find his memorial, a
pictorial representation in marble —The
Piping Cassowary of Cairns Leading the
Crabs to Their Doom.
“Impair”: It is pleasant to hear that
gold is reappearing for the first time
since the war on the tables at Monte
Carlo. What interests me particularly
about the announcement is that the gold
paid out by the croupier is in American
coinage units, these being taken from a
big pre-war gold reserve built up by the
Blanc interests in Paris before 1914. This
suggests that the proprietary justly
reasoned that, whichever country of
Europe went down in the looming clash,
the U.S.A. was in no danger. Another
statement which attracts attention is that
the American gold is shortly to be re-
placed by a Monaco equivalent. Can
anyone tell me when Monaco had a coin-
age of its own? In the years that the
locust hath eaten English gold and Bank
of England notes, with French currency,
were the only recognised media for a
flutter. Holders of other currency had
to change it into one or other of these.
“Der Jong”: Following on the de-
claration by the chairman of Vickers,
Ltd., that his firm belongs to no arma-
ment makers’ concern and has made no
profit from war materials —the post-war
reconstruction of the company is proof
enough of that —comes a book by one
George Seldes, a journalist whose news-
paper connections are not specified in the
cable, that Vickers’ built up the Turkish
Navy prior to 1914, thereby doing a dis-
service to the Allies. Apart from the
fact that, prior to August 4, 1914, no
one could swear who the Allies would
be, the “building up” was imaginary, the
Turkish Navy remaining the same
pathetic ruin it has been since Navarino.
Yet I for one still retain a grievance
against Vickers and his co-operator
Maxim. The pair designed and sold to
the Boers, some 35 years ago, a beast
of an automatic shell-shooter which did
more to put the wind up me the first
time I met it than any other experience
I had bumped to that date.
“Selma”: During one of the periodic
plague scares that used to sweep over
Auckland, the City Council issued
large wire cages to all firms which sus-
pected the presence of rats on their
premises. Each day they were taken
away with their occupants, duly emptied
and returned by the council rat-
collectors. One morning the office-boy
dashed in and invited me to “Come and
see the queer-looking rat they’ve caught,”
and I was presented to a creature golden
in color and entirely unlike any other
rat I had interviewed. He was quite
without fear, and rushed expectantly to
look over visitors, his nose through the
bars in friendly fashion. I secured a
reprieve for him and returned with some
titbits filched from the accountant’s
lunch, which he took from my hand,
sitting up and nibbling composedly. He
had, we decided, been someone’s pet,
and it was not long before a packer was
begging him for his small boy. Estab-
lished in a suburban home, he speedily
became pure white —the golden hue was
due to dust —proved to be a trained
acrobat and lived comfortably in cap-
tivity for three years. The theory was
that he had escaped from some travel-
ling show.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Protecting the North
“C. Coral”: “Kaloa's” plea (B.
~8/3/’34) for a regular patrol of the
northern waters has the backing of all
Northerners. Both for rescue work in
time of sea disaster and also for keeping
an eye on alien poachers, a properly
equipped craft is needed. So far back
as 1924, because of alien encroachment
on aboriginal reserves in N. Australia,
the Bishop of Carpentaria appealed to
the Commonwealth authorities for a
patrol boat, and got a promise from
Senator Pearce (Minister of Home and
I erritories) that one would be sent.
However, as the Bishop mentions in a
recent issue of his diocesan paper, “the
vessel provided was quite unsuitable, was
never on the coast, and was finally burnt
at sea outside Darwin.” It was because
of this lack of protection that the natives
of Arnhem Land did the very thing that
Kaloa” is afraid exasperated local white
residents may do in defence of their
property—“pot” a few Orientals.
But while a seagoing ship would pro-
bably prove useful, there is need also
for a ’plane service. As was evidenced
in the recent cyclone when Pilot Mc-
Donald, of Cairns, did magnificent work,
a ’plane can survey over a large area in
a short period, and can thus materially
assist rescue work. There should further
be provision for wireless communication
in isolated places by means of “baby”
portable transmitting sets, of the type that
have proved so valuable to the A.I.M. in
Centralia.
“Karuah”: Re “Isee” (B. 28/3/’34)
and New Guinea “anti-phlogistine,” I was
on Carranyelpa station on the Darling
during the shearing season in 1872.
Abo. Tommy was sent to help drove
sheep from the Paroo. During his
absence a young buck annexed his
wife. Abo. news was sent to Tommy,
who turned up quite unexpectedly in the
camp. A fight was arranged with nulla
and shield. Tommy beat his opponent’s
head apparently to a pulp. He then
threw a spear at his wife, which entered
above the groin, and was pulled out on
the opposite side. Both the injured were
carried to the bank of the river and plas-
tered over with white clay. Within 14
days both were walking about as good
as new. I’ll back the Darling treatment.
* * * *
“Chloe”: A neglected industry on the
Australian coast is seaweed conser-
vation. After the stormy seasons of
April and September quantities of edible
seaweed are washed ashore from Fre-
mantle to Wyndham. This Algce is the
same as that used in making the well-
known remedy for throat and chest
troubles known to the public as “Irish
Moss,” from the fact that the western
shores of the Green Isle receive a har-
vest after Atlantic storms. The weed
looks like very good asparagus. Prepara-
tion is simple. The vegetable is washed,
well scraped to remove any blemishes,
and soaked. The joints swell enormously,
and are allowed to absorb water for
from 10 to 20 hours. Then the mixture
is again covered with water and
boiled slightly, strained and left to
set. The resulting jelly may, of
course, be colored and flavored to
taste, and has the advantage of not melt-
ing with heat. Hence its popularity in
the Orient and the interior tropics where
ice is unobtainable. It can be reduced to
powder form for export, and makes an
admirable gelatine for setting with fruit,
poultry or fish. It is very nourishing, yet
its wealth is allowed to rot on the sands.

New rules for sustenance under the
Queensland unemployed insurance
scheme came into force on April 1. They
apply to workers employed casually and
intermittently, and provide the limit for
a man with four children at £l4 Is. Bd.
per month. In addition to increasing the
amount of sustenance, the change will
allow many workers to claim sustenance
lor days of unemployment who were pre-
viously debarred because of small earn-
ings from casual jobs. Waterside workers,
coalminers and other classes of casual
and intermittent workers will benefit.

Obsidian”: Following lead-poisoning
Cloncurry (Q.) child, aged years,
became incurably blind. Three years
oerore, the child’s father had painted his
nouse with white-lead and oil. In this
dry and sunny climate the paint rapidly
became powdery and the child absorbed
the powdered lead. Dr. Nye, in his
recent book, has indubitably proved his
case against lead in house paints, and
cases like this are criticisms to every citi-
zen in Queensland of our health legis-
lation. The Queensland Government has
been worried for many years by public
bodies to have something done.
* * sfc
“Vic”: Despite the impression which
the southern papers sometimes give that
it is a wild spot where most of the in-
habitants carry stilettos in their mouths
as they swim through Australia’s biggest
rainfall, Innisfail probably provides more
taxation than any other town of its size
in the Commonwealth. In State receipts
alone its 4000-odd workers and pro-
prietors found £15,665 in taxes during
March, which amounts to about double
the sum paid last year.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: One more sampan is caus-
ing excitement on the Queensland coast,
and it seems to have been treating the
local inhabitants as if it were a naval
invader. It arrived off Dunk Island
almost under the noses of the Cairns
police, and when a local inhabitant
essayed to go on board he was stopped,
and four sailors entered his boat and
remained there while he was alongside.
Meanwhile, feeling runs high among the
pearling fraternity, and it cannot be said
too insistently that sooner or later an
incident is sure to occur which will turn
the poaching from a local concern into
a matter of international politics. When
the Italian Government instructed its
Australian representatives the other day
to assist the Commonwealth to rid the
northern State of an alien criminal ele-
ment, the Queensland Home Secretary
remarked tartly that “the police would
not require any interference from else-
where, well intentioned as it might be-”
Now available, lovely Barrier Reef island, coral, palm-clad, uninterrupted sea
views and large, unopened food resources. A gift for anyone with a
good boat. Apply caretaker.”
Yet not only are the worst of the Italian
elements making life a misery for som2
of their compatriots, in spite of autho-
rity, but the Japanese invaders are
rapidly destroying a business on which
whole northern communities depend.
And both the State police and the Com-
monwealth Navy stand tolerantly by
without moving a finger to end the
nuisance.
* * * *
“Vic”: “Mataranka” (B. 21/3/’34)
will be glad to learn that Mr. Perkins
is framing special regulations for the
trial of the bucks from Caledon Bay.
They are to have “lenient treatment” —
it seems like a usurpation of judicial
authority for anyone to suggest it while
the case is sub judice —and if the Judge
feels it wise he “may take their case away
from the jury.” Judge Wells seems to
be a man with a firm mind, but he has
had no experience whatever with wild
blacks or any blacks, having been a
Sydney barrister in a modest way of
practice all his professional life. How
he becomes more competent to read the
native mind than an N.T. jury with a
lifetime of experience it is difficult to
say. And why have a jury system at
all if the Judge can wipe it out whenever
it is likely to lead to anything which will
induce the flapper press to condemn the
Minister? There is talk of native Courts
with specially trained men in New Guinea
and the Mandate. A similar system is
badly needed in the N.T. The Darwin
Court has nearly all its time filled up
dealing with cases of native naughtiness
which ought rightly to be handled
peremptorily and without frills by a
Commissioner.
* * * *
“II Vecchio”: The suggested resurrec-
tion of the British Preference League to
oust foreigners from the northern sugar
fields has stirred up a hornets’ nest. The
“Italo Australian Journal” voices some
Italian feeling by declaring that if the
report be true it “will be the greatest
blow that the sugar industry has suf-
fered,” “the greatest insult the Italians
have received,” “an end to peace on the
sugar fields” and “the point from which
racial hatred will be blown into a furious
flame.” It goes on to ask that the
Commonwealth shall ban the League
as an illegal association whose acti-
vities will lead to another Kalgoorlie
horror. The fiery editor need not
worry. Lots of leagues have been formed
in the North for such varying objectives
as separation and the holding of cattle
raffles, but they always end (unless spon-
sored by foreigners who got control of
the sugar fields through hard work and
organisation) in somebody suggesting a
drink. Whereafter, everybody who has
been shouting “Awake! Arise! ” etc., lies
down under a tree for a rest or returns
to his natural occupations, which are
cursing the Taxation Department and
killing mosquitoes.
“Australia Jane’s’’ Budget
Ercil Kelly, who marries C. B. Freeman on
the day that this letter sees print, was many
times entertained and tea’d in her last week of
freedom. Evie Logan—one of the brides-
maids—and Mrs. T. Logan gave a “blue- tea”
at the Tom Logans’ flat, at which bridge fiends
collected tricks on blue-topped tables, and
huge bowls of vivid blue hydrangea lent color
to the reception-rooms. When Mrs. B. T.
Cowlishaw was hostess at a similar party, sun-
burst roses and autumn-tinted zinnias were the
decorations, and the supper table wore trails
of antignon and crystal vases of pink roses.
Mrs. J. Graham Brown (Mabel Zillman, the
pianist, that was) rattled the hospitable teacup
at Rowe’s Cafe in honor of former pupil
Sylvie de Silva, who marries Lome Walsh
to-day.
“Standing room only” was the rule at St.
Augustine’s, Hamilton, when Meryl Raff mar-
ried Bill Cullen. The bride wore a trained
gown of gold and white lame, over which fell
a priceless Honiton veil, and Nancy Aveyard,
who attended, was in crystal-blue angel-skw
crepe.
When Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Hughes Sparrow
settled down at Indooroopilly 40 years or more
ago, that now a tony subbub, was just
plain bush. The couple celebrated their
diamond wedding last week, and friends
gathered in the palm room at the Canberra to
otter congratulations. Mr. Sparrow first saw
the light of day at Tenbury, in Worcestershire,
85 years ago, and his wife was born at Nor-
wich just 80 years ago. Both arrived in Bris-
bane in the ship Light Brigade, not on the
same voyage. Their romance began in Bris-
bane, and they were married in 1874 at the Oval
Church, Kelvin Grove, by the late Rev. Wool-
cock. Mr. Sparrow was first a carpenter and
then went in for sheep-farming in the Dalby
district.
The two pretty daughters of the George Web-
ster pair have opened a library. They have a
taste for literature; and the books on their
shelves will appeal to most modern tastes—
lowbrow as well as high.
Frankie Payne, who in society is known as
Mrs. Clinton, has been paying a visit to Bris-
bane, her home town, and at the council meet-
ing of the Royal Queensland Art Society was
warmly welcomed by president C. H. Lancaster.
Most of those of Queensland’s holiday-
migrating public who were not braving wind
and rain at Southport spent their Easter in
Sydney, and now are drifting homewards. Mrs
B. F. Yaldwyn and daughter Carlie are tv'rk.
and are spending some days at the old Nel-
son home, with Mr. and Mrs. Duncan Nelson,
before returning to their own roof-tree. Colonel
and Mrs. Kaye Puckle, who leased the Yaldwyn
home, are in Brisbane for a few days before
going to the East.
The three Allman girls made a bevy of
beauty last week when Violet married Harold
John Lynch at the City Tabernacle. Miriam
and Esmie ’maided.
Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd, of historic Harrow,
one of the oldest homesteads on the Downs,
with daughter Shirley, returned to Australia
in the Mariposa, but stayed in Sydney for the
Easter Show. Ihe John Collinses also went
down for the Show, starting off gallantly in
their own ’plane. Bad weather compelled them
to finish the journey by train.
Another Queenslander who recently visited
Sydney was Kitty Warren White, who had
been spending some months in Melbourne with
her brother, knight Brudenell White.
Mrs. J. A. Robertson is shaking the mud of
Brisbane from her shoes, and leaving for Mel-
bourne, where her home in future will be.
Mrs. D. F. Brodie gave a tea for her at Rowe’s.
Black cotele and parchment lace enwrapped
the guest of honor, who found a gift and a
spray of flowers at her place at table.
Septs of the Bell clan, one from Coochin
and one from Aroo, gave series of parties in
Brisbane before leaving for the Sydney Show.
If the depression continues to lift, polo
week in Toowoomba may be revived. The
Bells, Ross Munros, Billy Feez, Allans and
Armstrongs and many more Downs players
are strong for the project.
Queenslanders are beginning to thrust out the
under-jaw and strop the old bowie knife on
the boot when plans in connection with Prince
George’s visit are mentioned. It appears that
the Sussex is not to come to Brisbane —why,
no one seems to know, as the river—which is
better than the Yarra, anyway—is quite deep
enough. Our maidens put it down to the
jealousy of the southern girls, who want to
keep the visiting naval men to themselves;
and the oldsters mutter about “making Queens-
land the Cinderella of the States” whenever an
important visitor is expected. The Returned
Soldiers, a morning daily and the Premier all
are saying what they think about it; and
Commonwealth organiser Marr is shuffling the
responsibility on to the Admiralty, whose per-
mission, he says, must be obtained before the
Sussex can go anywhere. What he doesn't
make clear is that permission has been sought
for it to come up the Brisbane River. States
have seceded for less than this, so let Lyons
and his myrmidons beware!
Another question exciting much thought in
squattish circles is: Which station homestead is
to have Prince George? Edward P. liked his
stay at Coochin so much that he broke other
engagements (and the heart of at least one
prospective hostess) to spend a few extra days
there. The Yorks stayed with Mrs. Robert
Collins at Tamrookum; and at Nindooimbah,
the William Collins station, there are John
Collins and his young wife, who should make
a very pleasant host and hostess for a youth-
ful visiting royalty who, by the time he
arrives here, should have had enough red tape
to last him for a long lifetime.
Two English sisters, Misses E. and A.
Chandler, are visiting Brisbane, and they have
paid a tribute to our justly celebrated, though
in certain quarters much-maligned, climate.
“How the people in England would appreciate
it!” they say.
*‘Do I sleep? Do I dream?.... Or is visions •
about?” might well have been the wail of any
mere man introduced, without warning, to the
hats that bobbed about on the lawn ait the
Easter race meetings. Bun hats, saucer hats,
things like the paper hats we made as children,
but not so long; dunces’ caps and something
which appeared to have been intended for a
box, and then converted into a hat, with all
its corners dangling untidily out. They all
were to be seen. No matter if the female race-
goer weighed 17 stone or merely 7—one of
those funny little lids had to be worn. And
most of them looked frightful. Even Venus
herself would look funny with one of those
lids crashed on top of her tresses —and when
the thing perches atop of a short or a long
bob—ye gods!
Blanche Somerset, who was to have been
married last week to Ken Robertson, was
taken ill. and the ceremony had to be post-
poned. She had been so tea’d and entertained
that she must have been worn out, and one
big cocktail party had to be cancelled at the
eleventh hour, as she was not well enough to
attend. The wedding is to be fairly quiet, and
the bride will wear her travelling dress —some-
thing modish and very smart, in the latest
shade of ice blue, and trimmed with monkey
fur.
Bishop Taylor-Smith, who is to arrive from
the East this month, will be one of the speakers
at the City Hall on Anzac night. He was
chaplain-general of the Imperial Forces during
the last mix-up.
Gwen Munro, the Brisbane girl who won
the Paramount “Brains and Beauty” contest,
and went to Hollywood, has been given a
leading role in a play “Dear Bill,” the work
of another Queenslander, James Warwick.
Catherine de Mille has the second role, and
the play is to be given a “try-it-on-the-dog” at
the Community Playbox Theatre, Pasadena. If
it succeeds there it may go to New York and
London. In the old days, the Firm used to
try out new stars and new shows on Brisbane,
and both Gladys Moncrieff and Dot Brunton
made their first big hits here.

(1) What fish (besides blackfish ) are likely to
be caught rod-fishing near Sydney (a) off rocks,
(b) off beaches 3 (2) Tackle and baits for same . :>
(3) Are spinners, spoons, artificial minnows, etc.,
considered right for this type of fishing 3 (4)
If not, where are they a success 3—452.
(1) (a) Groper, parrotfish and other rock fish;
(b) whiting, bream, jewfish, tailor, salmon and
kingfish. (2) Tackle varies according to size
of fish sought, from fine gut for whiting and
bream to heavy cord line for larger fish. For
rock fish bait with cunjevoi or crab. For beach
fish, use worms, prawns or fish bait such as
mackerel, tailor or mullet. (3) No, although
a heavy spinner known as a tailor guard is
sometimes used off beaches for tailor; it is
thrown well out and then drawn in rapidly. (4)
Towed behind launches either in the estuaries
or offshore for tailor, kingfish, Spanish mackerel,

(1) How to construct a hard court for tennis 3
(2) Cost 3—885.
(1) Mark out the size of the court and
remove the soil to a depth of about six inches.
If ants’ nests are plentiful in your district
you can make a splendid court by filling the
excavation with broken nests, which should be
well rammed and rolled, and well watered to
cause the material to knit together; when well
made, this needs no surfacing. Otherwise, fill
the excavation with rocks or stones, roll
smooth and top up with cement or tar. (2)
Depends on method. Get quotations for sup-
plies from some vendor of building materials.

Method of staining aluminium 3 —901.
Treatments are described in Henley’s “Book
of Recipes,” under “Aluminium and Its Treat-
ment” and “Coloring Metals.” Processes are
too complicated to describe here.
(1) Amount of kauri timber imported annu-
ally from (a) Vanikoro, (b) Borneo 3 (2) Freights
per 1000 super, feet from both places 3 (3)
Amount of kauri imported annually from Vani-
koro to Sydney and Melbourne respectively 3
(4) How do these timbers compare with Q’land
and M.L. kauri 3 —695.
(1) (a) 1931-32, 1,031,132 super, feet; 1932-
33, 1,109,260 super, feet; all in log form. (6)
Nil. (2) No regular service from Vanikoro,
and no direct regular service from Borneo to
Sydney. If shipped to Hong Kong and tran-
shipped the freight on logs would be 100 s. per
1000 super, feet. (3) The imports from Solo-
mon Islands went one-third to Sydney and
two-thirds to Melbourne in each period. (4)
M.L. kauri is principally used for making vats
and high-class boat construction, including
decking and planking. Q’land kauri is used
for joinery, trough work, sink tops and tor
boat work where the highest class timber is
not required. Vanikoro kauri can be used for
all these purposes, but is reckoned inferior to
M. kauri.
(1) The cost of construction of the dam at
Burrinjuck on the Murrumbidgee 3 (2) Is the
retaining wall the highest in Australia 3 (3)
Is the amount of water stored in this dam
greater than any other in Australia 3 (4) What
is the lowest water level recorded in the dam 3
(5) What is the amount of electrical energy
generated 3 (6) Does the amount of power
vary much during a normal season and a dry
season 3 (7) Is the power generated more than
sufficient for present-day requirements 3 —413.
(1) £1,734,130. (2) Yes. (3) No; Burrin-
juck reservoir contains 771,642 acre feet; Hume
reservoir will contain 1,250,000 acre feet, but
may ultimately contain 2,000,000 acre feet. (4)
82 feet below full supply level in May, 1930.
(5) For year ended June 30, 1933, the maxi-
mum demand on the power station was 4700 kw.
and the energy generated 21,297,709kwh. (6)
While more power is available during a nor-
mal than during a dry season, the demand on
the station does not vary seasonally to any
great extent. (7) As electricity cannot be
stored in large quantities, only sufficient energy
is generated to meet actual requirements of
consumers.
(1) Population of town and district of Croy-
don (Q .) 3 (2) Living conditions 3 (3) Extent
of mining activities and any other industries ;
and prospects of increase in immediate future 3
(4) General state of prosperity of town and
district 3 —724.
(1) Approximately 296. (2) Poor, on account
of isolation. (3) and (4) A number of mining
leases have recently been applied for, and some
revival in mining activity is expected.
Name of a good hedge plant or short orna-
mental tree suitable for growing on wet land 3
—877.
Evergreen flowering shrubs planted in wet
lands are always likely to grow coarse, and will
need pruning to keep them shapely. They also
have a tendency to root-rot, for which there
is no antidote. Suitable varieties include hibis-
cus (single and double flowers of every hue),
acacias (wattle), plumbago, berberis, oleander,
ceanothus, buddleia, choisya and arbutus (Irish
strawberry tree). Privet (golden and green) may
be trimmed to any design, and will thrive in
any position. Excellent subjects are arum lilies,
which thrive on wet land.
(1) Details of the principle, construction and
action of the fluid flywheel 3 (2) On what
motor-cars is this flywheel fitted 3—764. _
(1) It consists of two hollow discs with in-
ternal radial webs cast in each; one anchored
to the crank shaft and the other to the main
shaft. A small gap separates the driving disc
from the driven disc so that the latter may
rotate independently. The internal space is
nearly full of ordinary engine oil. Centrifugal
force generated by rotation of the engine causes
the oil to flow to the periphery of the driving
disc, whence the webs deflect it to the
driven disc. Sudden retardation of oil imping-
ing on the driven disc causes the latter to
rotate. (2) Daimler, B.S.A. and Lanchester .
What is the legend of King Cole and his
daughter Helena, said to be perpetuated in the
civic seal of Colchester 3 —820.
The general design of the seal dates from
about the thirteenth century and perpetuates
the story that Coel Godebog (the King Cole of
the nursery rhyme, after whom Colchester
allegedly is named), having slain a king of
Britain, was, in consideration of his submis-
sion to Constantius, the Roman general, after-
wards Emperor, allowed to exercise nominal
sovereignty in England. He rebuilt Colchester,
and his daughter Helena was born there and
married to Constantius. They had a child, Con-
stantine the Great. St. Helena, like her son,
became a Christian and went to Jerusalem to
look for the true cross. This she claimed to
have found, and she returned with it to Col-
chester, where an abbey was built to contain the
relic. She became the patron saint of the city.
Who was Berthe Morisot ? Particulars of
her career 3—BoB.
She was the granddaughter of Fragonard,
and was herself a painter. Born at Bourges tn
1840, she studied under Guichard and Oudinot
and was a pupil of her husband’s brother
Edouard Manet, whom she respected so much
that she refused to sign her own works Manet.
She exhibited with the Salon from 1864 to
1873, but the work on which her reputation
rests was that shown in the exhibition of the
first impressionists at the Naders Gallery, Paris.
What were the arras tapestries of Stanmore
Hall, size, subject, designer, etc. 3—864.
They were designed by Sir Edward Burne-
Jones for the craft workers of Merton Abbey,
who were reviving the decorative crafts of the
Renaissance under the supervision of William
Morris and Dearie. They decorate the dining-
room of Stanmore Hall, are eight in number,
and are the only existing example of a series
of arras tapestries designed and wrought for
a given room. They deal with the Arthurian
legends, more particularly the quest of the
Grail, and are in silk tapestry. Below the
panels containing the principal subject matter
are other tapestries bearing scrolls, with the
legends in Gothic characters describing the sub-
ject, and themselves covered with a design
of a thicket with deer. On the branches of
the trees hang the shields of the Knights of
the Round Table.
(1) Are there such words as “oftener” and
“oftenest” 3 (2) Can these words be used cor-
rectly in speaking and in writing 3—867.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes, but there are many cases in
which, for the sake of graceful phrasing, it
would be preferable to use “more often” or
“most often.”
(1) In the event of a married woman in
N. dying intestate and leaving a husband
and four children over 21 years, how would
her estate be distributed ? (2) Federal and State
probate duty on an estate worth £l5OO, com-
prising savings bank and fixed deposits ana
Australian bonds ? —B6O. , ,
(1) One-third would go to the husband and
two-thirds among the children equally. (2)
Federal, up to £2OOO duty is one ptpund, but
where the estate exceeds £2OOO it is £1 per
cent., plus 4s. for every £lOOO or part in ex-
cess. The N. S. Wales Act (1933) provides
that in estates over £lOOO but not exceeding
£5OOO the duty shall be at half rates on pro-
perty passing to a widow or to children under
21. In your case it would work out at about
6d. in the £.
Method of removing dandruff and scurf from
the head ? —758.
Use a scurf pomade or refined mutton tat io
rub into the hair roots when dry, and mas-
sage the scalp daily with a bay rum and castor
oil lotion. Glycerine may replace the latter
ingredient if preferred. Shampoo once weekly
with green soft soap and hot water. Mean-
while give attention to health in general, and
avoid headwear that restricts circulation in the
scalp.
I am suffering from a toe rash which is very
itchy. It is of a red, pimply form. Treatment ?
—778. . ,
Keep affected parts dry, cleanse as required
with olive oil, and apply the following oint-
ment at night: Prepared calamine 10gr., bis-
muth subgallate 20gr., powdered chloretone
10gr., zinc cream loz. Smear on sparingly and
do not bind. In the morning dust freely with
zinc and starch powder (equal parts). Get
medical advice if trouble persists.
(1) Is Mackay cedar suitable for boat-build-
ing ? (2) What other Queensland timbers are
suitable ? (3) Name of book about boat-build-
ing ? —766. . . _ .
(1) Haven’t heard of it being used. It is
durable in the weather but rather heavier than
red cedar used in racing skiffs, being 481 b.
against 341 b. per cub. ft. (2) If you will send
details to the Queensland Forest Service, Bris-
bane, of your proposed boat, and for what
purpose it will be used, timbers for all types
of work will be recommended. (3) Any book-
seller can give you a list.
Recipe for soft soap 3—897.
Almost impossible to make a true soft soap
at home. A fair substitute can be made by
shaving household soap into a tin and adding
equal parts of raw linseed oil and turpentine
until the whole makes a thick paste. Stand the
tin in boiling v/ater to assist the mixing, or
place it over a covered fire —it is inflammable.
How to make guava wine ? —BB3.
The guavas should be quite ripe, and should
be gathered on a sunny day, so that they are
quite dry. Put the fruit into a wooden tub
and bruise it with a wooden masher. Then
cover it with boiling water, place a cloth over
it to exclude dust, and leave it for from one
to three weeks, according to the weather;
examine every few days after the first week
and do not let mould accumulate. Strain
through a cloth or fine sieve, and to every
gallon of liquor allow 31b. sugar. Stir well
together in a tub, or cask with the bung out,
and let it work for about 10 days. When it
has finished fermenting, add loz. isinglass and
£lb. raisins to every nine gallons of the wine,
and let stand for about six months, when it
may be bottled. It is better for keeping. A
little whisky or brandy may be added when
the isinglass is put into the wine.
Recipe for preserving beans in jars ? —B5B.
Select young beans of uniform size, and
pack neatly into the jars. Sprinkle lightly with
fine salt every second or third layer of beans.
When the jar is full, cover with a plate and
place a weight on top. Store in a cool place.
If the weather is hot, examine the beans occa-
sionally for mould. To use, soak in water
for an hour or two, then cook as usual. An
alternative method is to use screw-top jars or
those with clamped lids. Select young beans,
trim them to preserve whole, or cut up as for
cooking. Pack into the jars, and cover with
a brine made by boiling slightly-salted water
for a few minutes and allowing it to cool
before pouring on the beans. Fill the jars
quite full, place new rubbers in position, set
the lids on but do not fasten them tightly, then
stand the jars up to their necks in a boiler
of water, and bring to the boil. Let the con-
tents of the jars bubble for about 20 minutes,
remove from the boiler and screw down quickly.
Stand upside down to test for leaks. If there
is no leakage, store in a cool place; if the jars
leak, they must be boiled again and fastened
so that they do not leak.
Details of the Cumberland electrolytic sys-
tem, as used for applying electrolytic protec-
tion to ships’ boilers and condensers ? —9446.
The equipment comprises a low-voltage exter-
nal generator which supplies current to a num-
ber of iron bar anodes, suitably disposed in
and insulated from the boiler or condenser which
is to receive protection. The current flows from
these insulated anodes through the water into
the metal shell of the apparatus, which acts
cathodically and is connected electrically to the
negative pole of the generator. This system of
protection has the effect of detaching old scale,
etc., from boiler surfaces so that it can be
removed as sludge in the blowdown, and of
preventing the formation of scale on clean
surfaces. For further details see “The Causes
and Prevention of Corrosion,” by Pollett (Ernest
Benn, Ltd., London).
(1) What is meant by a coulomb of electri-
city ? (2) Difference between the coulomb and
the ampere ? (3) After whom were these units
named ? (4) Are they in use in America and
Europe ? —59.
(1) It is the amount of electricity that will
deposit by electrolysis o.oolllBgrm. of silver
in an instrument called a voltameter. (2) The
ampere is the rate of flow, being equal to the
flow of one coulomb per second. Thus, if a
certain current deposits 0.00559grm. of silver
per second in a voltameter, this will be equi-
valent to a current of 5 amperes. (3) Coulomb,
a French physicist, 1736-1806; Ampere, a
French physicist, 1800-1864. (4) Yes.
Means of deodorising kitchen fat or soap
made from kitchen fat and best way to clean
kitchen fat ? —3BO.
Store fat always in a cool place. Clean it
by boiling it for a short time with plenty of
water. Allow it to cool, remove the cake of
fat, scrape the lower surface free of impuri-
ties, then boil again in fresh water. Do not
keep fat long before clarifying it in this manner,
as if it is kept until there is a large accumula-
tion the oldest fat contaminates the remainder
and makes it very hard to clean.
I have an Irish terrier, aged 10 months, whose
ears droop sideways, instead of forward. What
can be done to correct the fault ? —335.
Nothing beyond resorting to plastic surgery,
which is very expensive and, in most cases,
ineffective.

THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
Case for the Teacher
The amount deducted from the salaries
ol officers within the jurisdiction of the
N.S.W. Public Service Board is £950,000
p.a. More than half of this sum —viz.,
£537,588- —is obtained by deductions from
the salaries of teachers. The Salaries Re-
duction Act has made these reductions,
, but, in addition, teachers are subject to
rise and fall in the basic wage, which
reduced the salaries of men teachers by
£4B 4s. Bd. p.a. between January 1, 1930,
and Nov. 3, 1933, and the salaries of
women teachers by £37 15s. Bd. p.a. over
the same period. Note also that the
salaries of women teachers are reduced
four-fifths of the basic wage of men
teachers.
Some deductions under the Salaries
Reduction Act:
The headmaster of a first-class high
school (Fort-Street, Sydney Boys’ High
olio others) has been reduced from
£787 12s. Bd. p.a. to £640 Bs. 4d. (Inci-
dentally, I would direct attention to the
salary attached to such a position in
most flourishing days. Does the public
know how poorly paid is the highest posi-
tion in the State teaching service?) Cor-
respondingly down the list the reductions
proceed to a third-class teacher, whose
•salary of £263 15s. 4d. p.a. has been
reduced to £222 12s. 2d. These salaries
are also affected by the basic wage and
the unemployment-relief tax.
As for overstaffing, the report of the
Minister for Education, 1932 (latest avail-
able), says: “The total number of
teachers in the service at end of the
year was 10,883, or 212 less than in
1931.” The number of first-year students
at Sydney Teachers’ College in 1932 was
207 ; for 1934 the number is 145.
Bank officers have not suffered basic-
wage deductions; their reduction of
salary has not exceeded 10 p.c. Some
insurance companies have not made any
cut in employees’ salaries. Officers of
the Commonwealth Bank also have been
reduced only 10 p.c. and are not subject
to basic-wage deductions.
Respecting superannuation, the public
servant is maintaining the same payment
to superannuation as heretofore. The
sound basic principle of superannuation
is that it is deferred-salary payment.
“Many” (public servants) “add to their
salaries by competing with the public in
various ways” says your leader, and cites
the instance of the official who drives to
golf in his car on Saturday mornings
while his flat tenants plod to work. Are
we to deduce that the public servant is
not to invest in flats and have tenants?
Is he not to invest his saved money in
anything?
The situation to-day is not at all what
it was on the introduction of the Salaries
Reduction Act of 1930. Take one
example among many. The saving to
N. S. Wales in interest and exchange
to-day is:
(a) Reduction in the interest rate £Bl,OOO
(b) Conversion of loans in London 1,072,000
( c ) United States going off the gold
standard .. .. .. .. 230,000
£1,383,000
Teachers made no protest against salaries-
reduction in 1930. They have not demon-
strated against Governments nor have
they attempted to obtain any political
patronage. — W. J. Hendry, General
Secretary, N. S. Wales Teachers’ Federa-
tion.
“Fair and Reasonable”
The public servants’ claim for relief
from the crushing burden imposed upon
them by the financial-emergency legisla-
tion is a fair and reasonable one. In the
crisis of 1931 they cheerfully shouldered
it—although they recognised that its im-
position was unsound in principle and
unjust in its incidence —on the distinct
assurance that it was of a temporary
nature. There are thousands of persons
who have suffered little or no reduction
of income. Take an employee of an
industrial concern which did not reduce
wages—and there were many such —who
has received £5OO a year since 1931. He
has contributed to the State little more
than one-fifth of the contribution made
by the public servant who was in a corre-
sponding position.
The statement (B. 28/3/’34) that out-
side workers have to provide their own
superannuation is, as it stands, neither
fair nor true. In these days most large in-
dustrial concerns provide some sort of
superannuation for their employees—
strong evidence that it is a sound com-
mercial proposition—and in some cases
the benefits are greater than those pro-
vided by any Government scheme in Aus-
tralia. Your comparison of the public
servant with the wheatgrower and fruit-
grower is beside the point. The man on
the land is not one whit better off because
the public servant is bearing more than
his share of the burden; nor would he
be one whit worse off if justice were done
to the public servant. In fact, salaries-
reduction adversely affected the primary
producer ; for the sudden withdrawal of
millions of money throughout Australia
from public servants who distributed it
in every direction seriously affected the
home market of the primary producer.—
J. R. Rule, President, Australian Public
Service Federation.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Quite a lot of folk who could rake up
a grandfather, grandmother, uncle or
aunt, or other settler forebear, went to
the Governor’s Ball. The results filled
the Town Hall with a bewildering dis-
play of Georgian, Edwardian and Vic-
torian costumes.
The balconies were gaily awninged.
The stage, a model of old Government
House, Parramatta, had its green door
guarded by two scarlet-coated soldiers.
Through it into a hall stepped the com-
pany of N.S.W. Governors, whose coats
of arms were emblazoned on the high
grey stone wall above them. Attending
these came the Blaxlands, the Went-
worths, the first Mayor and Mayoress of
Sydney, the King’s School group, show-
ing what a century had meant to their
uniform, Henry Parkes and his lady, the
country women of the ’sixties, members
of the First Melbourne Hunt and others
too numerous to mention —but all illus-
trious and colorful.
They were greeted by Sir Philip Game,
as Governor Macquarie, in scarlet and
gold braid, and Mrs. Macquarie, wearing
the Empire frock of her period in peach
satins, with long train, and, in her hair,
ostrich plumes.
The floor soon became an animated
scene of brilliant uniforms and rich
dressing. Men with side-whiskers, in
cocked hats, knee-breeches, buckled shoes,
swords and gold braid —what matter if an
epaulette or two had crept in before
their time?—strutted proudly. Women
walked gracefully in crinolines; in the
spreading skirts of the Hunter and
Phillip periods; in the straightness of the
First Empire gown ; in bustled skirts ; in
gay brocades and rich satins ; with posies
or with fans. Woman in the galleries
looked with sudden distaste on her
modern frock and longed for the time of
chairs and lackeys, of coaches and high-
stepping horses.
The G.-Gs. came to the party, Lady
Isaacs wrapping herself in gold and ivory
brocade ; the Lud Mayor and his lady,
she in wine satins, also sat in high places.
The eyes of Alexander Gordon’s lady
followed daughter Anne in her s’preading
skirts of lavender organdie and also
searched the crowd to see whom she
could interest in the career of singing-girl
Elsa Corry. The C. L. Joneses were in
this group —not to be overlooked was the
lady’s coronet of platinum and diamonds.
Dame Eadith Walker’s black laces met
with commendation. So did Miss Kate
Egan’s mulberry chiffons, and Janet
Knox’s silver-sequin cape, which she
wore over black satin.
The Easter race meeting has run its
course, ending in a blaze of sunshine that
changed the universal greeting “Isn’t it
wet?” of the first day into “Isn’t it hot?”
everybody telling everybody, as confi-
dentially as if passing on a “sure thing,”
what everybody knew, that it was the
humidity that made the day so trying.
In spite of the sun and the weather fore-
cast, the small upturned hat in one or
other of its 54 or more varieties was
perched on the head* and off the face of
many. The so-few-wise wore summer
silks, shady hats and sunshades, and
rejoiced as the hours steamed by
that they had left their Angoras and
furs at home with the moth-bricks.
Gold or silver lame appeared on every
other dress, sometimes as lining to
epaulettes, often as frilly and fussy bows
or ties, or as sashes and bands. Claudia
Beasley struck an unusual note in the
gold leaves that bordered the neckline
and cuffs of her brown dress.
The two lots of vice-regals went to
the races every day, and every day the
ladies gave the public something different
to look at in the way of dressing. The
Isaacs dame’s princess frock, in which she
allied black and ivory satins, and to which
as an afterthought she added a feather
boa all shining silver, was worth a second
and a third glance, but so were the beige
and the brown frocks of Monday and
Wednesday. The brown was of crepe
and had its caped sleeves banded in sable.
On the three days Lady Game wore
black, but always with a difference.
Once, when it was all black, it was served
with an ermine cape; another day there
was lily-of-the-valley. Each day there
were large luncheon- and tea-parties, the
G.-Gs. entertaining in one room, the
State Exes, across the passage in another.
Blue seems to be the favorite color of
Mayoress Parker. She wore it in one or
other of its shades at every meeting,
and it was worn also by Sadie Budge.
Out from the week’s group stood Mrs
Ellis Fielding Jones, who changed her
frock every day, as did the McKelvey
lady; the Murray lady, in currant-red
romaine and a red straw hat; Mrs. M. L.
Baillieu (Melbourne), in turquoise blue
and an outsize panama hat of the same
shade ; Mrs. O. E. Phillips, in black Otto-
man silks which showed a neat white
kilted hem; Lady Barlow and Evelyn
Barlow (guests of Sir Philip and Lady
Game), the former in grey tweeds and
silver-fox furs, the latter in black wool
crepes worn with a checked vest and
small velvet hat; and Jean Cheriton, in
China blue-and-white printed silks and
white hat.
There were 350 delegates in David
Jones’s auditorium when Lady Isaacs
opened the 12th annual talk of the
C.W.A. last week, and there was not one
dissenter when Lady Game said that
“the women in the country are the best
and bravest in the world.” After the
customary (and in this case deserved)
words of praise had been uttered by such
importants as Minister for Agriculture
Main, Minister for Transport Bruxner,
and president of the Bush Nursing Asso-
ciation Dr. Millard, the business of the
conference was done with such neatness
and dispatch that the agenda paper was
cleaned up within three days instead of
the four anticipated.
When Sydney’s academic ones are
gathered together, the subject of this
Peter Pan study, Susie Williams, is a
notable. She is the principal of the
Women’s College within the University,
and brings to that position dignity, a
rich, slow-speaking voice and a profound
knowledge of the classics. Before com-
ing to Sydney she was Senior Tutor
(Classics) at Trinity College, Melbourne
Uni.
The officers at Victoria Barracks lent
the nice old rooms of their mess to Mrs.
O. E. Phillips for her party in aid of the
Veterans’ Home at Bare Island, La
Perouse. They lent also their silver cups
—filled with pink and red roses —and the
little silver cannon that was something
extra to exclaim over when the bridge
players (arhongst whom was Lady Isaacs)
and the tennis enthusiasts gathered in the
billiard room for tea and chat, while the
Royal Australian Artillery Band played
on the lawn just beyond the stone-flagged
verandah. Brigadier-General Phillips,
who is one of the trustees for the home,
helped Mrs. Phillips receive the guests.
Sydney society buds slipped out of
becoming racing togs and into equally
becoming dance frocks and hied them-
selves to the Royal Sydney Golf Club
at the bidding of Janet Thatcher and
Margaret Burns. The two young hos-
tesses, the one in watermelon-pink satin
and the other in white satin, received
their guests in rooms filled with hydran-
gea, roses and Easter daisies. To give
the names of those who chased the hours
with flying feet would be merely to print
a few of the pages of Sydney s Who s
Who.” Suffice it to say that all who were
asked were there, and Mrs. F. W.
Thatcher and Mrs. James Burns did their
bit to help things along.
This is how Falk’s camera sees Enid
Baumberg, who has organised the Show
of Caricatures that will soon gladden the
walls of the Pompadour Room at Nock
and Kirby’s. It came about thus: Enid
heard that Syd. Miller had these carica-
tures of well-known and famous people,
and thought it wrong that they should
be hidden away from the public eye. She
asked him to show them in the interests
of the Crown-street Women’s Hospital.
He consented. Jimmie McDonald, of the
Art Gallery, will do the opening act on
Monday, April 16. Enid hopes to swell
the hospital’s funds considerably from
this show. It will be remembered that
she raised nearly £6OO from the “Snappy
Sydney” revue which she organised for
the same institution last year.
The Macquarie Club’s cocktail party
was enjoyably informal, Here, those
who had walked and talked together at
Randwick on Wednesday afternoon, met
and talked together again of the horses
that won or should have won, of the
Governor’s ball of the night before, of
friends who had sailed away or were to
sail away. In the moving groups, Phil-
ippa Stephen’s Madonna-blue summer-
weight woollens stood out, as did Mrs.
Venour Nathan’s black lacquered satins.
Mrs. Christian Thornett brought Captain
and Mrs. Chester Wells. Alice Sullivan
from Wagga and Mrs. J. Jamieson,
Temora, were others who cast apprecia-
tive eyes on the huge bowls of pink
dahlias in the hall and on the golden
berries in the reception-rooms.
On Sunday the Apostolic Delegate
(Archbishop Bernardini) blessed and laid
the foundation-stone of the Cardinal
Cerretti Memorial Chapel at St. Patrick s
College, Manly, using the same trowel
and mallet as Cardinal Moran used at
the laying of the foundation-stone of the
college. It was a blue-and-gold day.
From the top of the college flew Aus-
tralia’s flag, flanked on one side by the
gold of the Papal flag, and on the other
by the green of Ireland, and the sun
shone on an archiepiscopal crozier as
Bernardini, in cope and mitre, entered
the grounds.
Thousands of the faithful climbed the
hill and listened to the speeches of Dr.
Mannix and other amethystine-robed
members of the hierarchy, delivered from
a high-standing platform. On the plat-
form among the ecclesiastical princes was
Papal Countess Freehill, whose gift of
£lO,OOO has made possible the beginning
of the work.
Trains are becoming more and more
fashionable every night. At the Royal
Golf Club’s ball nearly every dress wore
one, even deb. Isabel Platt-Hepworth’s,
which was all white satin. Many, too,
adopted the Victorian style of let-
ting a demure frock seem to be
in danger of slipping from the shoul-
ders. In such cases the train was
a corded affair and stood like a seg-
ment of lamp shade. Epaulettes of silver
cord and a pointed cowl collar called for
attention as Nancy Westgarth whirled
past. Elizabeth Knox was in Persian-
red crepes, and Joan Hill’s wide sash of
deep-blue velvet had ends which swept
the floor. Her dress was the shade of
a blue hydrangea.
Among the small and intimate
luncheon parties of the week was that
given by Nance McDonald at the
Carlton for Captain Dunlop, of the
Anchises, the boat on which Rear-
Admiral Ford and his wife travelled to
Sydney. Also Barbara and Hilda Mul-
lins shook a cocktail party for Kathleen
Cobcroft and Mary Regan. The former
left on the Mariposa; her friend has
just returned after two years abroad.
The death of Mrs. Denis Allen after
an operation was an irremediable tra-
gedy to half a dozen well-known Sydney
families, and to many who were un-
related to her. She was one of the
simplest and kindest of the younger
matrons in the set that doesn’t advertise.
Her mother, Mrs. Dick Dangar, was a
Dowling, a racing enthusiast and a fine
horsewoman, and she was brought up
to a great extent on her father’s station,
where she learned to love horses and the
country. Like many other Sydney girls
of her generation—Sheila Chisholm,
Kath Osborne, Nan Garvan —she did
war-work abroad, and it was while she
was on the other side of the world that
she fell in love with Denis Allen. After
a distinguished career as a combatant air-
man in Flanders, where he got a D.S.C.,
he had been sent to London, which was
an air front by then. They were mar-
ried after the war. Her husband shared
her sporting and other interests; he and
his brother-in-law, Ken Austin, were the
Prince’s riding companions over the
fences at Randwick when H.R.H. was
here on the Renown. She shared his
professional and social interests. As
Harry Dangar’s sister, she saw a good
deal of the art world of Sydney, and she
had a sure taste in pictures and furniture
herself.
Anne Campbell Walker and John
Kater were made one at St. Stephen’s
one night last week. Her dress of white
lace was enveloped in a cloud of white
tulle ; orchids and lily-of-the-valley were
the floral addenda. There were two
’maids, and sister Mrs. Edward Withers
was matron of honor —all patou pink
satins and trains frilled and fussy with
tulle. Green orchids and salmon gladioli
added another harmonising note. The
Royal Sydney Golf Club housed the sub-
sequent reception.
Some exquisite Brussels lace was an
outstanding feature of Fay Fuller’s wed-
ding garment of white moire, and she
wore a Maoriland greenstone cross, the
gift of Dean Darby, of Auckland, an
uncle of her Joseph Berchman Darby.
Sister Mrs. Alfred Rainbow was matron
of honor, and Heather Arnott ’maided,
both in hydrangea-blue satins and tulle
hats. After the ceremony Fay slipped
into the Rose Bay convent to show the
nuns her nice new husband and her
bridal finery. Her choice in both was
found highly commendable. Then there
was a visit to the chapel, where Fay left
her bridal lily-of-the-valley on the altar.
The Ben Fullers spread the wedding
feast at their Darling Point home.
Among the interesting weddings of the
week was that of Hugh Gavin Crawford
and Lorna Dudfield—both of Brighton,
Vic. The two had known each other for
three years ; they met at Randwick and
suddenly wondered why they had wasted
so much time. Then came a dash to
get the ring—and a further dash to St.
Mary’s, where the knot was tied.
Miss E. D. Lane, who is staying at the
Wentworth, is a cousin of the late Vis-
count de Stern and of Lord Wandsworth,
Commander A. Lane, R.N., who was
captain of H.M.A.S. Waterhen before ii
left for A ustra li a » another cousin.


Melbourne
Chatter
Still just as popular as ever are cruises
on palatial liners where there’s too much
to eat and drink, where one gossips, lies
in the sun, wears smart clothes and is
amused by organised plans. Men are at
a premium, for with a preponderance of
attractive girls on board even the plainest
and shyest youths are assured of all the
dances they want. Recently one lass
cruised with eight pairs of slacks, 13
different shades of nail varnish and one
pair of stockings. But competition was
keen, and there wasn’t anything on board
vvorth working up to a “smouldering pas-
sion,” anyway. The young woman had
initiative. In a native shop she bought
a crystal and a book on magic and read
lutures in a secluded nook in aid of starv-
ing sailors’ babies. She became the rage,
and towards the close of the voyage, as
iellow-passengers drew her aside to
whisper which prophecies were likely to
come true, she kept a notebook for
surreptitious jottings. She has now
abandoned the gay life and is writing her
memoirs, from the sales of which she
hopes to make enough money for another
trip.
The International Club has become
such a sturdy body that it’s bursting the
seams of its clubrooms. With such things
ahead as the organisation of the cen-
tenary pageant, a larger domicile is
necessary, so the hunt is on for new
members. Mrs. E. L. Kiernan opened
her home La Perouse, whither she in-
vited numbers of friends and acquaint-
ances to meet the president, Mrs. Her-
bert Brookes, who discoursed upon the
club’s aims and objects. Edith Harrhy,
Mauricette MacGillicudy (whose open-
ing piano numbers were composed by
Melbourne woman Catherine Parker) and
Hilda Sedgley provided music within
doors, while a colony of small birds
hopped and sang outside among the
creepers. Mrs. Kiernan, in wine-red
velvet and a nosegay of salvia, arranged
chairs dexterously in the lounge. While
teacups were rattling Mrs. M. R. Mc-
Millan and Mrs. Guy Bakewell made a
successful haul with a dragnet held out
for prospective members.
When Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Brookes
issued invitations to their party of Satur-
day last they counted on a liberal per-
centage of absentees, so said the host;
but everybody accepted. Even so, chairs
were squeezed in for all. Mrs. Brookes
was clad in oyster chiffon, and Jessie’s
ivory satin boasted long sleeves and a
wide, off-the-shoulder neckline moored
to pearl straps. Etta Bernard, with
twinkling sequined shoulders, sang
sweetly (and bravely in front of such a
critical audience) to the accompaniments
of Carrie Cairnduff. Percy Grainger’s
Norwegian (or is it Swedish?) bride tied
a sash of bullfrog green round her white
lace. Miss M. Brookes and Mrs. Sande-
man-Allen, both newly arrived from Eng-
land, were there. Present also were Mrs.
Tom White, in pink wrapped into a cape
and formal long kid gloves, and Mrs.
Dora Meeson Coates. (A painting of
Mrs. Brookes by George Coates hangs
in the billiard-room.) Speeches were
made by the host and Prof. Bernard
Heinze. Percy Grainger, his hair longer
and thicker than ever, played a
Javanese scale and a few bars of some-
thing weird and Norwegian to ram home
the point of his speech in favor of free-
thought in music.
Dorothy Clark is doing a round of
parties as she stows away her trousseau
for Shanghai and her marriage there with
Rex Johnson. Eileen and Meg Johnson,
clad respectively in Empire-green lace
and rustling wine-red taffetas, took the
opportunity of giving their future sister-
in-law a dance at No. 9. Prof, and Dr.
Ethel Osborne’s daughter Yrsa, Prof.
Agar’s Elizabeth, Katrine Elder, Rose
Hartung, the Walter Timmins couple’s
eldest girl Cecily and Walter and John
Hill were among those who said good-
bye to Dorothy and welcome home to
Eileen and Meg.
Garryowen and Piquant have gone
to greener pastures and their brave little
owner lost her life after an attempt to
save them from a burning stable. Mrs.
William Murrell was considered Austra-
nas best all-round horsewoman. She
broke horses, trained them to race and
jump, and treated them with rare under-
standing. Garryowen was her special
chum, and at Mentone are cupboards of
■uu tr °P™ es ru § s wov en from his
ribbons A few days before the fire Mrs.
Murrell, who was a member of the
omen Citizens Movement, addressed
some of the members on horsemanship
fhW \/ S D < r Sabllities . for Birl riders under
•R.C. lestrictions. Her husband,
William Murrell, who was a notable cross-
country rider years ago, carried his wife
from the burning building and died as
a result of the fearful burns he suffered.
The train has arrived. It appeared at
all the autumn fashion shows on evening
dresses which were low and nude as to
back and demure at the throat (the
smartest collarbones are hidden this
year). Death traps they are, for the stouter
the material the heavier will be the fall
of the person who stands on one. If
the stuff is flimsy the frock is ruined and
its owner goes home in tears. Some
wrecks must strew the path to perfection
in managing them which we hope to
acquire at once. (Our ancestors took
years of gentle exercise and sitting up
straight.) One of the loveliest garments
which gyrated under the Napier Waller
murals in our finest restaurant looked
like a snowdrift ; its sleeves were of
white bunny.
The cocktail get-up will be tremen-
dously useful. One runs to a short coatee
of stiff white lam£, a cunning basque
above the hips and pin- wheel sleeves.
Remove it and your tiny black hat and
veil and you are perfectly dressed for
the dinner-dance in black velvet. Of the
1100 pairs of eyes which fastened them-
selves on the bridal group the trousseau-
hunting ones are twinkling with a new
idea. The ’maids wore silver lame tunics
over their pleated chiffon frocks. Mediae-
val girdles were their only ornament.
Hair is to be adorned with grandmother’s
jewellery taken from the family vault
and reset in the modern halo. Fur coats
show a new trend. Some are distinctly
swaeaerish, and tie at the throat with
a stole,
Ronald Esler portrays Mrs. Fred Rae,
whose home is the quaint old stone house
in the Botanical Gardens which was built
for Melbourne’s first Government Botan-
ist, Baron von Mueller. Mrs. Rae has
a delightful garden of her own, a bite
out of the botanical acreage which is
her husband’s domain. He is both direc-
tor of the Botanical Gardens and Gov-
ernment Botanist, and his biggest thrill
in years is watching the construction of
the new Herbarium. Made possible by
Macpherson Robertson, the £15,000
worth of buildings, specimens and books
will, when completed, be among the
finest in the Empire. Mrs. Rae has a
flair for arranging flowers; to her no
bloom is so alien that it won’t mix
satisfactorily with something else. She’s
a clever character actress, and has
played and produced for several amateur
societies.
Lavish and splendid were the Hender-
son-Thornley nuptials, which commenced
at Christ Church, South Yarra, proceed-
ing afterwards to the New Embassy. The
knot was made fast by the Bishop of Bal-
larat. Roger Henderson is an English-
man with aristocratic connections in his
own country, and Judy Thornley, of
Gnotuk, Camperdown, is famed in Mel-
bourne and the Western District for her
beauty. Her bridal satins with a swathed-
off-the-shoulder corsage descended into
shimmering twin trains, and an eddy of
tulle swirled from a Russian headdress
of orange blossoms and laurel leaves.
Following were small Anita Urquhart in
satin to her toes and a turquoise bonnet,
and Western District ’maids Vera Thorn-
ley, Jean Weatherley, Deborah Staugh-
ton, Lorraine Cumming and Claudia
Palmer. Their ivory gowns were cut in
a similar fashion to the bride’s, and
velvet haloes put a finger of sophistica-
tion upon their headdresses.
This week brings two big weddings.
June Baillieu faces the altar with Sam
Hordern and Joan Syme with John
Hayne. Friday was Miss Syme’s most
feted day. Mrs. Noel Russell, in town
for a few hours from Barunah Plains,
wrapped herself in a black cloth dress
with shaven lamb for collar and gave
the bride-to-be a luncheon-party at Men-
zies. Late-afternoon cocktails were
mixed by Dr. Lawrence Stokes, who is
to be one of the groomsmen at the wed-
ding, and then came a dinner-party at
the home of the Herman Lawrences, with
their daughter Jean sitting in the hostess’s
chair. Thence the not-yet-exhausted pair
proceeded to the Peter Manifolds’ dance.
The pale-green ballroom was a fairyland
of glistening crystal, silver balloons and
immense jars of flowers. Mrs. Manifold
(she is Mr. Hayne’s sister) shimmered in
white satin, and her locks were bound
with a green halo. The Pat Fairbairns,
the John Fitts couple, Dr. and Mrs. John
Shaw and Commander and Mrs. Geoffrey
Haggard were among the guests.
This is Betty Drake-Brockman, who
every day is discovering more attractions
about Melbourne. She’s from Perth, and,
after a holiday with her cousin Deborah
JJackett in Adelaide, proceeded on her
first visit to this city, where she has
stayed with the Judge, her uncle, Mrs.
Drake-Brockman and the Argyle lady.
Betty is having a round of dances and
parties with the young things of Mel-
bourne —hence the twinkle in her eye.
The little cap is her own handiwork,
made in a few minutes on her way to
accept an impromptu engagement. Broo-
thorn made the portrait.
Hermannsburg will have its five miles
ot pipe-line, which means a permanent
supply of good water. Doubtless the
Brethren are drinking to the success of
the appeal in the local brackish fluid
with its infusion of magnesia which
makes an unpalatable grey drink of tea or
coffee. The money was raised in Mel-
bourne in a few weeks. Of the authors
whose autographed works were sold for
the fund, the most popular proved to be
Mrs. Tineas Gunn. Her books raised
£64.
The fourth woman among 200 men
to join the Vic. Institute of Architecture
is Nell Edeson. Miss Edeson has just
returned from abroad filled with added
knowledge and enthusiasm for her work.
She loves trees and is immensely grati-
fied when she can plan a house and leave
undisturbed the native trees in the
grounds. Her gardens are planned to be
lived in, not just looked at and admired
as a frame for the house.
Judith Campbell, youngest daughter of
the C. E. Campbells, of Melbourne, has
announced her engagement to lan
Walker, of W.A. He’s a son of the
Lightfoot Walkers, of Darling Point,
Sydney.
Perth’s budget of parties and personal
notes:
Dressing at the Easter race meetings ranged
from height-of-summer organdies to depths-of-
winter furs and raincoats, but the majority
of feminine punters stood by the adage “When
in doubt wear black.” The sun, bursting from
behind a cloud, made the fur-coaters regret their
decision, but when his rays disappeared the
flimsy-wearers shivered. The v.-r. party came
along to both meetings with the Terrence
Anketells in tow, and lent an ear to the
snappy tunes puffed out by the R.S.L. Band.
The blue-tipped feather-fronds of Mrs. Jimmie
Withnell’s boa wafted over marine mousseline;
Mrs. Geoffrey Everett’s goblin cap ended in
a rainbow peak; Maude Mitchell swung a
deep cowl and wide raglan sleeves on her
cornflower wind-swept crepes; the slit back
of Mrs. Bruce Atlee Hunt’s summery florals
was outlined with wee buttons; Betty Spark
spruced black marocain with thick navel cords
and an eye-shielding biretta; Mrs. Alec Wil-
liam’s white bib and tucker matched the jaunty
tassel hanging from her magpie fez; and Mrs
Kath Chenery clasped a wide black belt
around her black-and-white pin-checked suit.
Trails of ivy wound around tall vases of
Easter lilies on the platform of the Karrakatta
Club hall and tables were adorned with roses
and zinnias for the members’ musical evening.
President Mrs. Duncan Paton, swishing gar-
denia-patterned hyacinth georgettes, and the
brown-lace-clad Hobbs lady, bowed official
welcomes to the Mitchell lady’s strawberry
craquelle, and Florence Hodd arranged the
programme.
Gwenyth Bishop’s sft. 9in. of femininity
was slipped into snowy silk crepes for her
coming-out dance. Mr. and Mrs. W. P
Bishop, she in Egyptian blue lace, stood at
the doors of the Cottesloe Hall to receive the
six-score guests.
Social lights of the port foregathered at the
Oriental Hotel, Fremantle, to bid bon voyage
to Mayoress Gibson, who is setting sail for
the Cold Country. The guest of honor’s nut-
brown laces were flanked by Mrs. K. Saunders’s
navy floral marocains and the burgundy suit
of Mrs. M. Humble, whose pleasurable duty
it was to make the presentation.
Cruising on the Cathay provided an excuse
for a number of farewell parties given by and
for the voyagers. Major and Mrs. J. S. Duffy
shook cocktails for 120 guests at their South
Perth home before stepping aboard; Mrs. Rod
Davies sailed off after brewing a pot of tea
at Toby’s; Mary Forrest and Molly Mahood
were feted by the young things; Dot Cadd
played many a final rubber of bridge and Hilda
Lee Steere masticated a good-bye luncheon.
Tooth-tugger Maisie Campbell returned from
a year’s post-graduate work in England and
immediately was rushed to the Palace to quaff
cocktails. Fellow-professional Gwenyth Tebbiit
rallied the troops and pinned a spray of frag-
rant gardenias on the shoulder of her coral
silks to toast the returned one.
The Rev. A. W. Bray officiated at Wesley
Church for his daughter Doreen’s marriage to
Mr. C. A. Anderson, and uncle Rev. A. J. S.
Fry gave her away. Easter lilies and roses
nestled against the bride’s mushroom chiffon
and lace with its matching hat. Matron-of-honor
Mrs. J. A. Smith combined ciel blue and grey,
and ’maid Peggy Anderson carried a basket of
roses in front of her apple-blossom pink paro-
cain.
The Anzac House Ball, arranged by the
Press Sub-branch of the R.S.L., topped the list
for numbers at last season’s dances. At its
effort this year (May 4) a positive horde of
debs, will make their bow to his Ex.
Adelaide’s contribution;
There was a record crowd at the Oakbank
races. His Ex. was present, and Lady Hore-
Ruthven attended for the first time: They ex-
pressed a desire for a picnic luncheon, so it was
served to them out of doors, but the dust
rather spoilt the notion. Lady Hore-Ruthven
wore a beige crepe de Chine patterned in
brown, and her hat was a shiny brown straw.
Mrs. H. D. Young (wife of the chairman) was
in a navy ensemble and black velour hat.
Nora Young chose a dark-blue tailored suit
and a felt hat to match. Lady Clark (wife of
Tassie’s Governor), who was a guest at Gov-
ernment House, was with the vice-regals. She
wore sapphire blue and a hat to tone trimmed
with velvet roses. The Premier’s wife looked
well in a navy suit and wide-brimmed navy
straw hat.
“Our Miss Gibbs,” at the Theatre Royal, has
played to packed houses, and theatre parties
have been numerous. Mrs. Wallace Mitchell,
of Melbourne, gave a large dinner party for
members of the co., and also a luncheon party,
at which the floral decorations were a feature,
the champagne glasses being the centre of a
posy of rosebuds at the place of each guest.
Mary, second daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Andrew Muecke, of Stanley-street, North Adel-
aide, was married to Dr. Gilbert Jose, of Wood-
ville, at Christ Church, Dean Jose, the bride-
groom’s father, officiating. The bride wore a
charming frock of heavy white lace, long-
sleeved and high-necked, with orange-blossom
wreath and long tulle veil. Her bridesmaids,
Zell Goodman, Betty Bruce, Pat Stoddart and
Mary Harry, were in dainty ice-blue georgette
frocks and picture hats of the same, and (heir
shower bouquets were of pink roses.
The same afternoon Joycelyn, daughter of
Mrs. Edmund Bowman, of Kensington, mar-
ried Jack Evans at the St. Peter’s College
chapel. The bride wore ivory lace, fitting to
the figure, and a tulle bridal veil. Her brides-
maid, Katherine Wemyss, wore figured ring
velvet, toning from apricot to crimson, and a
hat in dark shade with apricot flowers.
St. Peter’s College chapel, too, was the
Mecca to which women and girls flocked to
see the marriage of Dr. Brian Swift to Joan,
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Tennant,
of Princess Royal station, Burra. The new
headmaster of the college, Rev. Guy Pentreath,
officiated at his first Australian wedding. The
invited guests filled the chapel. The floral
decorations (roses and Easter lilies) matched
the bridesmaids’ frocks of palest pink crinkled
chiffon with wreaths of pale-pink and blue
flowers. Joan Goodman and Miss P. Horn
were the elder ’maids, two little flower-girls,
Janet Davidson and Patricia Nott, attending
also, in Kate Greenaway frocks. The bride
wore a princess robe of heavy white satin
moulded to the figure, with high neck and
long, tight-fitting sleeves. The skirt merged
into a long train, and there was an equally
long bridal veil of tulle, held in place by a
coronet of orange-blossom.
The Roy Bullocks opened the season for
debutante dances when they entertained about
200 guests at a coming-out dance for daugh-
ter Helen. The house was decorated with flowers,
and so was the huge marquee where the guests
danced. Supper was served in the dining-
room, the table arranged with pink roses and
pale-green candles in crystal candlesticks. Mrs.
Bullock looked well in black lack lace, and the
debutante wore a dainty frock of white chiffon,
trimmed with frills, and a pearl bandeau. She
carried a posy of crimson roses.
Miriam Hyde, Adelaide’s Elder scholar at
present studying at the R.C.M., London, has
had the thrill of playing her own pianoforte
concerto with the London Philharmonic Or-
chestra, under the baton of Leslie Hewerd. For
the big occasion Miriam wore pink velvet, and in
the audience were Lord Palmer and Australian
composer Arthur Benjamin. The most august
of London’s musical critics said nice things
about the Australian girl’s work both as com-
poser and executive performer. The concert
took place at the Royal College’s hall in con-
nection with the Patron’s Fund founded by
Lord Palmer, one of the objects of which is
to provide for the rehearsal and performance
of works by British composers.
Hobart has a word or two to say:
T.A.J.C. race-meeting fell on a deceitful day
—it promised rain and gave none. Chairman
Young’s wife was in navy and white with small
navy hat. Nearly all the women were coated
or tailored. On the lawn were Col. and Mrs.
Whitham, Mrs. N. Atkins, Mrs. E. A. Rogers
(in a nigger-brown turnout with smart little cap),
Mrs. Rupert Agnew, the Norman Fergusons,
Mrs. W. B. Propsting, Mrs. W. Wolfhagen,
Mrs. Neville Pringle, with daughters Betty and
Margaret, and the James Murrays.
Mrs. Gillies (Sydney), who has been visiting
her relatives, the Percy Grubbs, of Strathroy,
entertained friends old and new at a late-after-
noon party at the Launceston Hotel, where the
lounge was blushful with pink dahlias and
autumn foliage.
F. J. Corder, Commissioner for Malta in
Australia, has presented to Launceston
Grammar School a stone, to be set in the walls
of its chapel. It came from the shore of
the Bay of Malta (Melita in the Acts), where
the Apostle Paul was shipwrecked.

Moorapi the Hunter.
BY ARTHUR FALK.
MOORAPI, his dark body poised and
alert, his spear held aloft, the
muscles of his broad back rip-
pling, watched the river slip by.
Moorapi’s father, years ago, had
brought him to this spot, had shown him
how to stand on the bank, motionless as
a bronze statue, until the dim shape of
a fish came within range ; how to plunge
the slender spearpoint into the water,
then dive quickly and almost noiselessly
to recover the victim. His father had
taught him everything worth while —how
to hunt the emu and opossum, to track
the wallaby through the long bush paths
and to spear the fish .'in the great river
which flowed through forests and gullies
to'the edge of the earth—until Moorapi
became'the hunter of the tribe, praised
by the hoary elders, worshipped by the
women, feared by the men.
Feared by ..all but Kua Baboka, who
was said by-Tawala, the medicine man,
to ‘be possessed by all the evil spirits—
a- reputation not to be envied by anyone
but owned with unwholesome indiffer-
ence by this renegade. Moorapi had
fought with him many a battle of skill,
almost to the death, with the sympathies
of most of the tribe on his side, and had
on each occasion repented not having
rid earth of this serpent. Kua Baboka
lived to contaminate the place with his
presence ; lived, in fact, to do more harm
than Moorapi dreamed of.
Moorapi’s lubra, Wirringara, had
loved her mate since childhood. With
all his savagery, he was gentle to her;
in return she kept his gunyah clean and
neat with ferns and grass, and broiled
lizard and emu flesh fo/- his meals.
For the eleventh time that day he
thrust his spear with unerring aim into
the water, followed it himself with a soft
splash, and clambered back to the bank
with a large, beautiful fish whose red-
and-grey scales glistened in the clear sun-
light as it wriggled vainly for freedom.
Moorapi gathered his eleven fish into
a bag of plaited reeds and walked along
the river bank. It was now time to go
home, where Wirringara would be wait-
ing to cook the day’s catch. The long
evening shadows were spreading over the
grass, and cool wisps of breeze, touch-
ing the surface of the river, wreathed it
into curled ripples.
As he left the stream and struck the
meandering track which would bring him
to his gunyah, Moorapi saw a strange
shape sprawled on the ground—a human
shape covered with torn clothing. Near
by was a large canvas pack. For five
minutes the dark man stood, spear in
hand, examining the object at his feet.
Then he slowly and cautiously rolled it
over, and a face, remarkably pallid and
with a ragged growth of hair, was turned
towards him.
The eyes opened and looked at Moor-
api in: feeble surprise. Then the thin
lips parted, as if in an attempt to form
words; but they could no more than
move weakly.-
Tawala, the medicine man, had told
Moorapi repeatedly that his dead father
would re,turn, his spirit embodied in
some unfamiliar form. Moorapi had
listened attentively,- but with doubt. Now
the words of the sage came back to him.
What could this be, .placed in his path,
other than the spirit of his sire?
Instinctively remaining still and rigid,
he searched the surrounding bush with
his eyes. Turning again to the man lying
in the grass, he noticed that .the parched
mouth had opened once more, trying to
speak. He walked to .the river, with fre-
quent backward glances. Filling his
cupped hands with water, he hurried
back, knelt beside the white man and
held the cool drink to his lips., .
Three lots of the soothing liquid were
swallowed eagerly, and Moorapi, prop-
ping the man’s head and shoulders com-
fortably against a tree, resumed his stolid
watching. He saw intelligence creep into
‘the blue eyes,-a tinge of color steal into
the cheeks. The reviving man mustered
! sufficient strength -to draw his hand
wearily across " his forehead, and to
mutter some words unintelligible to his
black rescuer. Another gleam of reason
told the latter that this derelict could
not completely recover without food.
He laid down spear and bag and,
grasping the wasted slip of humanity in
his arms, lifted it over his shoulder. He
took up his hunting gear again, also the
white man’s pack, and stumbled through
the bush with his burden.
Wirringara was awaiting his home-
coming. When he dumped his human
load on his own bed of ferns she ran
from the hut shrieking. He brought her
back, made her look on the stranger
i with complacency, then told her to broil
the fish quickly, for this man from some-
where at the other end of the world
needed food above everything.
Unconsciously, Moorapi had assisted
in the making of history. He whom he
had dragged from death was the only
survivor of an ill-fated exploring expedi-
tion whose goal was the very same river
in which Moorapi caught fish. Disaster,
in the shape of sickness and shortage of
water arid provisions, had robbed the
explorers of victory. The single sur-
vivor had determined to push on alone,
but had himself at last succumbed —
within fifty yards, if he had only known
it, of the river.
In the care of Moorapi and Wirrin-
gara, he regained his strength. Moorapi
and he one day set off down the river
to a spot where the white man knew a
rescue party should touch. They waited,
and it came. The white men could not
understand why the tall, powerful abo-
rigine wept as he relinquished his charge.
A settlement sprang up there. It grew
from a few tents to a cluster of small
houses, then to a township. The people
in it treated Moorapi’s tribe with kind-
ness, though they showed a tendency to
interfere in their affairs, assuming a sort
of righteous responsibility.
Moorapi, meanwhile, lived his accus-
tomed life as if nothing extraordinary
had occurred. He took every opportunity,
however, of visiting the settlement down
the river and looking secretly and with
awe upon the being who was, without
doubt, the reincarnation of his father.
Moorapi felt a new joy in living. His
mind and senses seemed to have risen to
some blissful altitude of which he had
before been ignorant; his daily round ot
hunting and eating was invested with a
kind of romance. He now lived with a
definite purpose—to prove himself worthy
of the magnificent gift which had been
bestowed upon him, the gift which
Tawala had prophesied would come.
He returned to the gunyah one evening,
the day’s kill in his bag, his spear gripped
in his hand. Wirringara would be wait-
ing as usual, sitting on her haunches by
a glowing fire, love for her dusky lord in
her eyes. And Moorapi hurried as this
picture presented itself in heightened
color before his mind.
Coming level with the door of the hut,
he stopped abruptly. There were voices
within —unusual, for Wirringara seldom
took women friends into the hut. He
moved closer and stood in the doorway.
A man and woman crouched near the
fire, arms entwined. One was Wirrin-
gara ; the other, Kua Baboka. incarna-
tion of all the evil spirits.
Moorapi stared, unseen. Kua Baboka,
whose oily skin shone in the firelight
like that of some demon, was speaking
in scarcely audible accents.
Moorapi’s teeth bit savagely into his
lip. He clenched his spear and raised
it level with his shoulder. There was a
swift whirr as it shot through the air,
and a howl of pain as it sank into the
shoulder-blades of Kua Baboka.
Moorapi had lost his honored place in
the tribe. He no longer led the braves
through the winding bush tracks, no
longer stood beside the river like a
figure carved in ebony, spearing fish. He
was an outcast, dragging his lean, tired
body over dry plains and hills, his eves
bloodshot with suffering and fear. The
white men, those of the township which
Moorapi had seen grow, were now the
hunters ; he was the hunted.
The whites had asserted their strong
authority. They had vowed to bn n §
Moorapi, the murderer, to justice. They
were hot on his trail; he had often caugru
a glimpse of them through the trees. He
knew the hunt could not last much longer,
as the hunters were fresh and well-
nourished, while the quarry was but an
emaciated human frame.
At night he would cower among some
shrubs, • exhausted, and -snatch a lev
hours’ sleep. At dawn he would be ott
again, trying to gain on his pursuers ,
but before the sun was half-way into
the sky he would inevitably be cnpplea
with fatigue and hunger and would be
forced to crawl into hiding. His meals
were scant and infrequent, consisting ot
berries and .what small birds and lizards
he could lay his hands on.
Moorapi, during this ordeal, never toi
an instant thought of himselt as a
criminal. He felt no remorseful pang,
but rather a sense of pride, at havmg
rid his fellows of Kua Baboka. And he
knew that those of his village, thougn
they submitted to the white man s law
and looked askance at their idol, in
reality loved him for the deed. ror
had not many of them, including the

RESERVOIR
OF
NATIONAL
CREDIT
IT is the main function of a Central Bank to provide
the credit necessary for effectively carrying on the
productive activity of the country.
Ever since its establishment, the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia has been gradually developing as
a Central Bank.
Since 1924 it has been obligatory on the Trading
Banks to maintain deposits with the Commonwealth
Bank.
In 1929 the Trading Banks handed over their gold
reserves to the Commonwealth Bank, which credited
the Trading Banks with, what was then, the value of
the gold lodged.
By these developments the Commonwealth Bank has
become the ultimate source of national credit. As
"the lender of last resort," it can determine the
volume of credit available in the community for the
financing of trade and industry.

oldest and wisest, wept when Moorapi
had fled before the white man’s anger?
Slowly but relentlessly they closed on
him. He made a valiant effort to break
away, making lamely across open plains
which appeared to promise a distant hope
of freedom. But one day when grass
blades and tree leaves shrivelled under
the fierce sun he fell prone.
A man came towards him. Moorapi’s
heart beat furiously, his head reeled in
dizziness. He heard the rapid footsteps
approach, and found himself staring into
a revolver muzzle. He realised, though
his sight was blurred, that he had seen
this man before. It was he to whom he
had brought handfuls of cool water that
evening by the river, and whom he had
secretly worshipped since. And he saw
recognition in the eyes which glared at
him.
His captor looked more closely, as
if to make sure he was not mistaken.
“You!” was the single word he said.
Moorapi, though he knew this word,
could find no reply, but only mouthed
helplessly. The pistol was put away, and
a water-bottle was unstrapped and held
to the aborigine’s mouth.
Moorapi gulped eagerly, catching his
breath at the sudden coldness which
poured into his throat. When he had
drunk, the owner of the bottle replaced
it at his belt, then stood irresolute, feet
planted apart and arms folded. He
looked down at the captive and said:
“You kill friend?”
Moorapi nodded. The speaker shaded
his eyes with his hand, and looked
around as if in search of his comrades.
Then he spoke again:
“You kind to me long while ago.
Gave me water and food ; took me to
my friends. You good boy then. Why
murder?”
Moorapi could just comprehend these
words. He answered hoarsely:
“Me kill debil.”
The other continued to regard him
steadily.
“If you have chance, you kill again?”
Moorapi rejoined, simply: “No more
debils.”
His questioner could not suppress a
smile. Then suddenly he asked:
“You find way about country?”
Moorapi nodded.
“Go quick, then —go far away, or
white man will kill you. You save this
one’s life —he give you chance. See?”
There was understanding in the abo-
rigine’s wide eyes.
“Go quickly!”
The white man had left him in an in-
stant. Moorapi watched him until he was
a mere speck in the shadow of the dis-
tant fringe of gums. A little later he
himself struggled to his feet and
wandered off aimlessly.
It was perhaps natural that Moorapi
should have found his way ultimately
back to his village. He had no intention
of seeking out Wirringara ; he knew he
could never again take her to him as his
lubra ; but something drew him towards
his native place. However, he had a
story he could tell his tribe, of how his
dead sire’s spirit had stayed the hand of
the avenging white man! There would
be a grand corroboree to celebrate the
miracle and to pay homage. He must
return, if only for this.
He eluded the punitive party and en-
tered the village one starry night. No
one recognised his lone silhouette as he
passed among the huts. He paused
before the gunyah where dwelt Wirrin-
gara and her mother, peered into its dark
interior, saw nothing but the still forms
of sleepers, and passed on.
At the outskirts of the village, near
his own gunyah, he encountered a
number of the tribe gathered in the
flare of a burning pile of sticks. Still
unnoticed, he joined them.
Close to the fire something of human
shape was stretched upon the ground.
He studied the upturned features ; their
deadly pallor struck terror into him. A
white man! The white man —motionless
and sombre, the kindly face set in the
contortions of death, a dark-red spear
wound in the throat.
Moorapi’s anger rose against the
callous tribesmen who grimaced and
hovered gloatingly over this mutilation.
They recognised him in the firelight.
They gripped his arms in wild welcome,
pointed with triumph at their handiwork
and asked him to join them in their re-
joicing at the destruction of one who had
dared to drive Moorapi from them. But
he stood in sullen contempt of their
advances, and flung them from him.
Overcome with bitter nausea, he turned
from the wondering group and slunk
through the darkness.
The river scintillated, like a broad
sheet of silver, in the rising moon’s light.
Moorapi stood at its edge, a gaunt figure,
and looked into its depths. Perhaps he
thought intensely, with all the power of
his primitive, undisciplined brain. His
entire life might, at that moment, have
passed before his mind in dull pageant:
the bush and river his world, his hunting
and his woman Wirringara his life. But
all this had crumbled to pieces ; and his
greatest inspiration lay lifeless and
bloody at the feet of his own followers.
Moorapi himself, it seemed, had fallen
fast from happiness and esteem into some
dark, fathomless, empty chasm, from
which he could see no escape.,..
The white men never found him, the
slayer of Kua Baboka. But the abo-
rigines to-day cherish a legend that this
Moorapi sank to rest in the deep river
which flows to the edge of the earth, and
that his spirit lives yet in its waters.
Dan and Uncle Keep Their Appointment.
BY STEELE RUDD.
THE birds along the Macintyre were
‘'till warbling their morning song
when Dan and Uncle turned up at
Lossberg’s to keep their appointment.
They had slept soundly and breakfasted
heartily. Dan, as he ate, reckoned he
had “never tasted better meat.”
Carl Lossberg looked up as they
arrived. y
“Mine vife she vill show der yob she
have fo’ you,” he said, addressing Uncle
“so you vait a leetle vile till she come’
hey?” ’
Uncle nodded. Uncle would have just
as willingly waited a year for her to
come.
Lossberg turned to Dan.
“Und you, mine frien’, come mit me.
I drive you to der killing-yard und show
you der vork I have fo’ you . Yump
up. Voh, Nancy, Voh!”
This last to the old mare in the sulky
as he took the reins and scrambled into
the conveyance.
Dan, thinking hard, climbed in beside
him without saying anything. Dan often
thought hard without saying anything.
They reached the killing-yard, half a
mile out. It was an aged, crumbling
construction, reminiscent of pioneering
days, and enclosed by a three-rail fence,
the panels of which were moss-covered
The smell of stale blood, offal and
sheepskins pervaded the place But
without such an atmosphere it would not
have been a killing-yard— to Dan at
least. It would have been merely a
dusty, deserted, haunted old landmark.
A few fresh-looking sheep pelts
dangled on the yard rails, and as the two
alighted a family of “cah-ing” crows
flew away and skulked in the branches
of a coolibah near by. No other signs
of life were visible.
You ve plenty blasted crows here,”
Dan grunted, eyeing the spying carrion
hatefully. “Hoogh! Yow!” he shouted
at them- “I’d like to give th’ lot of you

“ 1 know.” Dan wagged his head.
Notbin new to Daniel—he’s done it all

“You had killing-yard yourseluf?”
course, Dan more or less lied,
bld I never let them get as bad as

cr ?P of bleach ed heads, shoulder-blades,
shinbones and all the rest that were every-

That was just what the cheerful Ger-

Then he clapped Dan on the shoulder

following him to where a copper boiler
was set up on bricks and covered with a

“Oh, I know,” Dan said, taking oft
the cover, “that’s your boiling-downs
But ugh! Cripes” (spitting), “it’s pretty
strong. You’ve never cleaned it out!
“No; dot is what you mus’ do,” and
Carl smiled.
Dan spat more and noisily replaced the
improvised cover. “Yes, I know, he
said, “but I’ll make a start on the clean-
ing up first.”
“Yah, yah, you start anyvere you like.
I go back to der shop now; und my
boy Oscar he come mit tucker und tea
for you at feed time.”
“Right,” Dan agreed, flourishing his
long arms. “I’m at it.”
Lossberg shook the reins and Nancy
jogged off.
Dan, left to himself, surveyed his sur-
roundings again. It wasn’t like Dan to
start anything right away. He entered
the yards and mooned about studying
their design and construction. From the
“big” yard he moved to the crush, then
to the killing-pen. He measured the
height of the enclosure by reaching to the
caps with his hand. The slam-door,
patched with sheets of tin and hung with
rusty hinges, interested him. Then the
pithing platform and the crumbling
gallows beside it inspired his imagina-
tion.
Dan had his imaginative moments.
They made life easier for him.
“Many a bullock’s been dropped in
here,” he reflected, leaning back against
the broad rails and stretching his arms
along them to either side. “There’s been
some rushin’ an’ snortin’ and bellowin’ in
here! An’ some blood flowin’, too —
an’ knives flashin’.” He closed his eyes,
let his head droop and was silent awhile.
“Cah! Cah!” fell eerily on his ear.
Dan started, and looked up.
The crow scouts, satL.ied he wasn’t
going to sleep or die, flew back to the
main body to report.
“Y’ black curs!” Dan called after
them, “y’ thought I was going to die
on me feet. If I had a shotgun you’d
think different.”
Leaving the killing-pen, Dan went out
and made a real start. And how he
worked! For a couple of hours he was
hard at it, almost running from one lot
of bones and horns and shins to another
—stooping, gathering them into his arms
and piling them in heaps until the land-
scape on every side resembled a paddock
of stooks.
Presently, half-hidden in the grass, he
came upon some sleepers on blocks,
apparently the foundation of an old hut.
Strewn about, protruding from the
ground, were fragments of broken cups
and saucers, rusty sardine-tins and necks
of bottles, suggesting that the place had
been a dwelling.
Dan kicked up the earth about the
sleepers in a thoughtful way and then
sat down on the squared surface of one
and reflected.
In his mind he could see that old
framework inhabited in years long past;
could see the door opening; hear the
chain on it rattling; see the faces and
forms of an old couple as they greeted
each other. He could see a fire burning
and smell supper being prepared.
While all this was passing before him
his eyes were fixed on the face of a
block from which the end of the sleeper
had become displaced. There was a circle
about an inch and a half in diameter in
the centre of the block.
Dan came out of his dream.
He noticed that the timber within the
circle differed slightly from that of the
block itself. It was not so frayed or
weatherworn. He leaned over and gazed
at it; then, taking out his pocket-knife,
he began pricking it. The part loosened
and moved.
“A peg,” thought Dan, “driven in by
the cove that built the humpy and sawn
level to make the block look sound.”
He pressed the knife hard into it and
a plug about three inches long, varnished
smooth and sound, came out on the
point of the blade. Dan saw that the
hole it revealed was cased with tin, and
fastened to the edge of the casing were
two small wire hooks, opposite each
other. He gripped the hooks and pulled,
and to his astonishment up came a tin
socket about six inches long almost filled
with gold coins.
Dan nearly dropped dead. Open-
mouthed and open-eyed he stared all
round in silence.
Then he gasped “ Sovereigns!”
After holding the tin before him for
some moments, he drew a deep breath
and stood up, looking about in every
direction to see whether he was being
observed. He then threw the contents out
on the sleeper, as if throwing dice, and
began counting.
“Twenty-five beautiful quid,” he said
at the end of the count, “an] put there
by th’ cove who lived here in this old
hut; made it his bank —an’ left it till
>he died. Left it for Daniel to find!”
He put sovereigns in all his pockets,
returned the empty tin and put the plug
back in its place, smoothed the block
over with his big, rough hand and went
off to work again, smiling.
He didn’t gather many more bones
or horns, though. He just walked about
with hands in his pockets, fumbling and
fondling the gold pieces and making
music with them.
Oscar, the butcher’s son, arrived in the
sulky.
“Aha!” Dan greeted. “Brought m>
dinner?”
“And my own, too,” Oscar grinned
coming to a stop and handing out a
basket of food.
“Let’s make a picnic of it over here
on the sleepers of this old hut,” Dan
suggested, going off with the basket.
“Coogan’s Castle,” Oscar said, making
the horse and sulky safe.
“Is that what they call it?” and Dan,
emptying the basket, made a table of
one of the sleepers. “Anyway, it’ll do us
for a dining-room, no matter what it’s
been. There you are, me boy, squat
yourself on the end of that sleeper and
make a table of the block in front of
you.” The block was the one which
had held the treasure.
As they ate and drank Dan observed
the other slyly to see whether he would
notice the “circle” in the centre of the
block, but although Oscar rested his tea
on it and brushed fugitive ants from it
at intervals he observed nothing un-
usual. Still watching, Dan from time to
time would smile knowingly to himself.
“What was Coogan,” he asked curi-
ously, “a shepherd or boundary-rider or
what? Did ever you hear?”
Oscar had never heard, but “thought
the old man would know.”
When they had consumed all the pro-
vender and packed the “empties” back
in the basket, Dan suggested a game of
“peg-knife” to fill in the hour.
Oscar was agreeable, and Dan, pro-
ducing his pocket-knife, said: “We’ll
play on that block in front of you.”
“A good place to play, too,” Oscar
laughed. “So long as it don’t break your
knife.”
“Plenty more where it came from”;
and Dan led off, tossing the knife left
and right into the block. Several times
he aimed it at the head of the peg, but
just missed it. Then came Oscar’s turn.
He was skilled in the game, and soon
gained a lead.
“Now head,” he said, “but I’d better
put me old hat on.”
Resting the blade-point on the crown
of the felt, he propelled it hard. It hit
the peg and remained quivering at the
perpendicular.
“Ha! Look at that,” Oscar triumphed.
Dan “ha-ha’d” too.
Oscar pulled out the knife. The peg
came with it. Then it was Oscar’s turn
to look astonished. Dan pretended to
be surprised too.
Oscar gaped at the peg, then at the
hole in the block.
“’Ell!” Dan dissimulated, looking into
the hole. “And it’s lined with tin—look
at it.”
Oscar looked at it, then stared at Dan
with increased surprise.
Dan fumbled with the tin till he “acci-
dentally” lifted it out. “ ’Ell! ”he said.
“Look, a’ empty shell!”
“Someone’s put it there” —excitedly
from Oscar. “Might be a bomb! ” And
he sprang to his feet.
“No,” Dan disagreed calmly ; “the end
of the sleeper was right over it when the
humpy was standing. It was meant for
something else. Howsomever, I must
go off an’ do a bit more cleanin’ up or
I’ll be gettin’ th’ sack.”
Off he slouched, grinning his hardest
and leaving Oscar pondering the mys-
tery.
Turning round when a short distance
away, he added: “I’m not burnin’ any
of the sheep’s heads yet awhile —I’m
goin’ to look at their teeth first. When
sheep have been feedin’ on short grass
near th’ ground they often get little nug-
gets o’ gold stuck in them.”
“Do they?” Oscar said, placing his
eye over the hole in the block.
“They’re gold fillin’s,” and, chuckling,
Dan went on again.
He had just started a huge bone fire
when something exciting happened to
Oscar.
“Here, come quick!” he shouted to
Dan.
Dan, suddenly filled with fresh won-
der, went quick.
“What have y’ found?” he questioned.
“Money—pound notes!” Oscar gasped,
displaying a banknote.
Dan was genuinely surprised this time.
“Hokey!” he said, taking the note to
examine it —“a fiver!”
“P’raps there’s more,” cried Oscar, in-
serting a length of stout wire and operat-
ing it like a corkscrew.

Dan looked on with gleaming eyes as
Oscar jerked the wire and pulled forth
a “bank-ball.”
Dan seized it and unrolled it eagerly.
“Strewth!” he said, “a tenner and a
twentier !”
“They’re mine,” Oscar exclaimed, “th’
lot of them. Here, you take this an’
get up some for yourself.” He handed
Dan the wire.
“Yairs —when there’s no more left,’
Dan murmured. But nevertheless he
probed and screwed the wire round and
round the bottom of the hole.
“Feel any more?”
“No, you got ’em all—th’ bottom’s quite
dry and hard.” Dan withdrew the wire.
“No more, eh?” asked Oscar.
“You’ve done pretty well,” Dan told
him. “Thirty-five quid without workin’
for any of it, and it belonged to some-
one else.”
“But I found them,” Oscar claimed.
“And if you’d thought of lookin’ into
th’ hole like I did you’d have found
them, and they Would have been all
yours.”
“That’s all right,” Dan agreed, press-
ing his pockets where the sovereigns
were hanging heavily. “I’m glad you
got them.”
His conscience seemed to be relieved.
“I’m off home with them to the Old
Man” ; and, stuffing the notes into his
shirt, Oscar headed for the sulky.
“Take this with y’ too,” and Dan
tossed the tin sovereign-case to him.
Away went Oscar, putting the whip
on to Nancy and waving back to Dan
as the sulky rounded the killing-yard.
Dan made more bone fires, sending up
curls and screens of black smoke and
grey smoke, and filling the air with a
mixture of strange smells.
Presently there was a clatter of wheels,
and the sulky came rattling around the
killing-yard again with Carl himself
standing in it, holding his hat with one
hand and urging Nancy to her fastest
with the other.
“Oscar he tell me,” he called excitedly
to Dan as he leaped down, “how he find
a hole by der sleeper in der Coogan Castle
vid all der money. You show me, mine
frien’?”
Dan, wagging his head, showed him
the discovery.
“Mine gracious!” Lossberg exclaimed
with uplifted hands, “dey plant him in
der block! Tirty-fife poun’.”
You’d have thought another Ballarat
had been discovered.
“Who do you think planted it there?”
Dan asked.
“Old fellow Coogan, vary likely,”
Lossberg answered, “but he vas died a
long vile ago.”
“It might have been bushrangers,” sug-
gested Dan. “Thunderbolt or Ben Hall.
So the money now, I suppose, will be-
long to anyone.”
He was “fishing” lest he might have
to disgorge the sovereigns.
“It belong to him who find it, mine
frien’,” Carl adjudged.
Then, patting Dan on the back, he
sympathised with him for not “finding
him first.”
“You not have such sharp eyes as
Oscar,” he laughed. “He tell me you
blay penknife mit him on der block, and
not see der plug.”
Carl laughed more.
Dan grinned and drawled “Yairs.”
“Never min’; I give you fife poun’ for
yourseluf ven I put him in der bank.”
“No, no,” Dan objected, shaking his
head. “I don’t want it; give it to the
old Uncle.”
“Orl right,” Carl agreed. “Der vife
she vill give him der fife poun’ for
sewin’ der clothes.”
“That’ll be splendid,” Dan appreciated.
“An’ he’ll be pleased, too. Poor old
cow!”
Autumn Rains—Tasmania.
Autumn came without her jewels, all her price-
less gems of rain,
And the summer-weary acres wave their fading
flags in vain.
We shall wake to grey days later; through the
smoke-haze presently
Watch the brown hills disappearing through a
misty filigree;
See in dew of gleaming mornings pearly mush-
rooms, mountain-fresh,
Linked together in the sunlight by a tangled
silver mesh;
See the patterned cobwebs swinging out their
heavy beaded skeins,
And the crisp young grasses gleaming under
crystal daisy-chains
That have diamond stars for petals, slung
across a rain-drenched week,
While the new greens, water-misted, turned to
shadowy lalique.
Autumn came without her jewels, but be sure
she will not pass
Till she leaves her diamonds winking; drops
her moonstones on the grass;
Leaves white sapphires cool and dripping,
whue the earth is drenched again
And the miles begemmed and jewelled in the
sunshine after rain.

A FAINT stir in the air roused
Duggan from his dark brooding
and made him wind up his slack
line. There was heaviness overhead, a
jumble of movement in the quiet water
around the reef. All afternoon clouds
the hue of bruised flesh had been mass-
ing in the south-east, and, though there
was no wind, the hazy sky had held a
sense of expectancy. Then there was the
frigate-bird, creature of ill-omen, that
had kept hovering round the boat.
Young Petersen, hearing his chief
move, came along with a lantern from
the stern.
“Well?” he said. “Satisfied now,
Harry?”
His jocular tone stirred the devil in
Duggan anew.
“Satisfied with what?”

“Well—what?” ‘
The snapped question took the wind
out of Petersen.
Ob, if you can stick it, I can. But

Duggan’s only reply was a grunt.
“The devil you would,” he was think-
ing, his eyes sparks of light in the dim
galley. “She’s probably watching out for

. Half-afraid of the growing darkness
inside him he tried to give it a rational
base. What was the point of going back
with empty ice-boxes when all the dealers
were clamoring for fish? And though
they had trolled in all the familiar spots
for five days the kingfish had gone from
the sheltered water. Their only hope
lay in picking up cod and snapper along
the reef.
Yet, lying awake, Duggan couldn’t
keep his thoughts away from Petersen
and the girl.
“Breaking his neck to get back to her.
Yet scared to own up for fear I’d run
amuck. Well, he’ll have to wait.”

CIRCUUATIOHS^
“You never told me we were running
dry. There’s not enough juice to carry
us forty miles, and we can’t put up
canvas with that gale blowing. We’re
going to stick.”
Petersen looked gloomily at the misty
beach three hundred yards away.
“I suppose it’s Hobson’s choice.”
“It’s .mine, too,” Duggan muttered,
“and I’m going to take damned good
care she doesn’t drift this time.”
Dourness and determination were
stamped on his lean, sun-darkened face
as he began to strip off his clothes.
Petersen looked at him with a curiosity
streaked with uneasiness, as if he were
not quite sure of his sanity. They had
been mates for two years, sharing the
hard life of the reefs, working the boat
together, going together on their occa-
sional sprees; but he had never seen
Duggan like this before, even when he
had been drinking.
“You’re not going down among the
coral?” he said.
“Aren’t I? Perhaps you are, then!”
“Don’t be a fool, Harry. There’s no
need.”
“I know what I’m doing. I’ll get that
hook around something that’ll hold till
the chain’s torn out of her.”
Moving to the stern of the plunging
boat he plunged into the troubled water.
Three times he came up breathless after
an unfruitful exploration among the
coral a couple of fathoms down; the
fourth time he managed to get hold of
the chain and wind it round a boulder.
He was half-unconscious and bleeding
from coral-cuts when Petersen hauled
him aboard, but there was an obscure
satisfaction in his bloodshot eyes. The
job had been done.
They had need of all the security they
could acquire. Shrieking, the gale broke
over them, and even in the shelter of
the island there was little relief from
the mountainous seas that stood the boat
up on end or threw their thudding weight
on the decks. A sour froth scudded over
the face of the water, which was streaked
with weed and floating pumice. Over-
head the sky was a wrack of slaty cloud,
and occasionally low-flying wreaths of
vapor brought a blinding rain.
Lying on his bunk hour after hour,
wind and sea making a deafening racket
around them, Duggan could not help
concentrating on the pair of feet stick-
ing out over the edge of the other bunk.
They were large, knobby, a little twisted,
in sharp contrast with Petersen’s good-
looking face. All his dark rancor
against Petersen seemed to be given an
excuse for existence by those ugly feet.
“Damn it all, why can’t he cover them
with a blanket! Poking thein out like
that as if he’s proud of them. .
He was waiting for Petersen to bring
up the Purdie girl’s name in some con-
nection or another, but the young fellow
was stolidly reading; he seemed to have
forgotten his itch to get back, the pub
by the wharves, the girl herself. Duggan
felt he was throwing out an inky screen
for himself like a cuttlefish. Whom had
she meant, if not Petersen, when she said
slily the last time he had asked her to
go out with him:
“Not allowed to any more, Harry.
Tied up for keeps now No, I can’t
tell you who it is. Ask me next time you
come in.”
But hadn’t he seen her leaning over
the fence with Petersen the evening be-
fore, her plump figure a white blotch in
the shadow of the outhouses? For the
last year Petersen had been pretending
he had a girl down the coast, but he
guessed that was a blind. Why had he
suddenly taken a dislike to camping on
the boat while they were in port? And
hadn’t the Purdie girl’s face been flushed,
her fingers all thumbs, when she waited
on the three of them at breakfast—Peter-
sen, himself and the fat sergeant who
had been living at the pub since his wife
died.
From bouts of grey sleep he woke
always to the same thing—dim light,
thudding of water against the frail shell,
clatter of tins and boxes that couldn’t
be made fast. The little cockpit stank
horribly of bilge-water, and the crazy
rocking dazed the eyes, but there were
always Petersen’s feet looming from the
bottom of the other bunk. Occasion-
ally the young fellow roused himself to
make tea on the primus, but the water
had got into their small store of flour
and sugar, and, anyhow, cooking was
almost impossible in the tormented
galley.
By the end of the fourth day Petersen’s
good humor was beginning to wear thin.
“I don’t mind going short of tucker,”
he said, “but it’s murder to be out of
tobacco. Got any fags left, Harry?”
Duggan’s response was sour.
“One or two. I’ve cut out smoking as
long as we’re penned up in this hole.
Air’s enough to turn a man’s inside as
it is.”
Petersen crawled outside to stare at
the heaving water, the wrack of floating
pumice. . .
It was next morning that the crisis
came. Petersen was bringing in tea from
the galley when a lurch of the boat sent
him reeling forward, and Duggan awoke
to a scalding heat, a sense of liquid fire
pouring over his neck and chest. Murder
was in his eyes as he sprang up and
grappled with his mate. Wordless, pant-
ing, they clawed at one another in the
swaying cockpit, and all Duggan s stored-
up passion was concentrated in his fingers
as they met round Petersen’s throat.
A muffled grunt and then a crash as
Petersen went down heavily, striking his
head against a corner of the bunk. He
lay huddled on the floor, curiously lax
and inert, and gradually the madness
seeped out of Duggan. He rose drunk-
enly and looked at the prone figure.
“What the devil’s been riding me?”
was his thought. “I don’t want the girl.
Could have had her any time this last
year if I’d promised to marry her and
make her a home.”
Slowly Petersen pulled himself up into
a sitting position. He was dazed ; he
seemed utterly at a loss to remember
where he was or what had happened to
him.
Duggan went out on deck and stared
at the dim shore. He wanted to make
it up with Petersen, but a curious shame
inhibited him. How could he admit
that it was the idea of the girl that had
been nagging at him ever since they had
left port? Her lively, provocative eyes,
her body flowing away!
By next morning the wind had dropped
sufficiently to allow them the use of their
sails. Unshaven, bleary-eyed, keeping
away from one another as much as pos-
sible, they beat out of the channel, start-
ing the engine as soon as they picked up
the headlands of the port. Color was
coming back to the sea ; the breasts of
the flying gulls seemed carved in snow ;
the mountains of the mainland stood out
in bold relief as if washed to the bone.
Half-way down the channel they met
a launch coming out to look for them,
and it signalled them to stop.
“Damn it all, you old humbugs, why
couldn’t you have stayed out a bit
longer?” the fat sergeant said as he
climbed aboard. “Here I am fitted out
with fishing tackle and enough tucker for
a fortnight—and it’s all bloody well
wasted.”
“Eh?” said Duggan stupidly.
“You’ve spoilt the whole show,” the
sergeant repeated. “If you’d have kept
out only half a day longer I’d have
missed you, and could have spent a good
week looking for you among the reefs
and little islands. Congratulating our-
selves, Kath and I were, that you were
lost just in time for our honeymoon.
You fishermen always turn up when
you’re not wanted.”
It was the sight of the Purdie girl
smiling at him from the launch that
struck Duggan dumb. He watched her
across the fifty yards of water, her plump
figure in its brown jumper bending flatly
over the rail, the glint of gold in her
mouth, the faint mockery of her waved
hand. He had never really wanted her ;
he was dead sure of it now. Yet not till
they were moving again did he recover
his old self.
“Forgot to ask the swine for tobacco,”
he said to Petersen with a friendly growl,
“Yet for days I’ve been all dried up
inside for the want of a good smoke.
r was that made me such a cranky
brute to live with. Wonder you didn’t
i a y m y head open with a boathook.”
The Garden of Desire.
It is set in verdant valleys, it is ringed by
royal ranges
That are rose and pearl at dawning, that are
blue and gold and grey,
As the sunshine and the shadow weave their
own appointed changes
On the face of crag and summit through the
shining stretch of day.
It is threaded through with silver, where the
radiant rills go singing
By the paths of purple pansies that are
strung with pearls of dew,
Where the royal roses cluster, passion-hearted,
swaying, swinging
To the low wind’s lilt and laughter as it
lingers, passing through.
Sleeping ever under heavens that are calm and
deep and spacious,
Holding hidden ways of gladness where the
feet can never tire,
Once, ah, once alone for ever, if the gods be
good and gracious, .
May the human footsteps wander in the
Garden of Desire.
Through the lace of falling lilacs in the dim
enchanted garden,
By the drone of dreaming waters, they shall
find the hidden power;
Lifted up to heights unvisioned by the grace
of Love, the Warden,
They are one with the Immortals for a briet
and golden hour.
But for those to whom the glory of the Vision
had been given _ .
When the shining ways of wonder for their
feet have once been set, .
Not through any tears or triumph, or the joys
of highest Heaven, . .
Shall the splendor pass or perish, or the
spirit quite forget.
Though they pass through pain and passion,
though they sit beside the embers
Of a love they thought eternal, still the
memory shall bless
And the vengeful gods be powerless, when the
longing soul remembers
How they walked the wondrous garden in
its summer loveliness.

THEIR SYMPTOMS AND
TREATMENT.
Worms, by their movements and the inter-
ruption they offer to the contents of the
Bowels, generally occasion pain or uneasiness
in the Abdomen, sometimes spasmodic, some-
times gnawing and biting, and not infrequently
of a vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the Nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is charac-
teristic of the affection. The Bowels are often
disordered, sometimes relaxed, as in Dysentery.
The appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently alter-
nating with another. The Abdomen is often
hard, swollen, and tympanetic, the breath heavy
or foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and
disposition to grind the teeth during the sleep
are other characteristic symptoms. The effects,
however, often extend beyond the Alimentary
Canal, and various derangements of health
are experienced in consequence, either of the
direct irritation of the worms or of the dis-
ordered digestion which they occasion. Amongst
the most common of these are nervous affec-
tions, such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturbed sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids.
i : \
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to recog-
nise the fact that their little ones are suffering
intense pain and distress, and are practically
irresponsible for the outbursts of temper, rest-
lessness and peevishness, and until some more
serious symptoms appear nothing is done
alleviate the distress. The symptoms of thi
disease are somewhat variable, but generally
they are so characteristic that no mothe
need have any doubts. The best proof o
worms is worms, and if the general conduc
of the child is such as to give the slightes
suspicion a careful watch will afford ample
proof.
A child who is affected with Thread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an
indifferent state of health. It becomes peevish
and irritable in its temper. Another point
to which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to
start in its sleep, its repose being in the way
of a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation com-
pounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties which
destroy the worms, but cause no injury to
the Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in the
form of a confection or lolly, have no dis-
agreeable taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they would
an ordinary sweet.
