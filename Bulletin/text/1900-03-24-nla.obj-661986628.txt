THE SPIRIT WOOED.
A.rt thou gone so far,
Beyond the poplar tops, beyond the sunset-ban,
Beyond the purple cloud that swells on high
In the tender fields of sky ?
Leanest thou thy head
On sunset’s golden breadth ? is thy wide hair spread
To his solemn kisses ? Yet grow thou not pale
As he pales and dies : nor more my eyes avail
To search his cloud-drawn bed.
O come thou again !
Be seen on the falling slope : let thy footsteps pass
Where the .river cuts with his blue scythe the grass :
Be heard in the voice that across the river comes
From the distant wood, even when the stilly rain
Is made to cease by light winds : come again,
As out of yon grey glooms,
When the cloud grows luminous and shiftily riven,
Forth comes the moon, the sweet surprise of heaven :
And her footfall light
Drops on the multiplied wave ; her face is seen
In evening’s pallor green :
And she waxes bright
With the death of the tinted air; yea, brighter grows
In sunset’s gradual close.
To earth from heaven comes she,
So come thou to me.
Oh, lay thou thy head
On sunset’s breadth of gold, thy hair bespread
In his solemn kisses : hut grow thou not pale
As he pales and dies, lest eye no more avail
To search thy cloud-drawn bed.
Can the weeping eye
Always feel light through mists that never dry V
Can empty arms alone for ever fill
Enough the breast ? " Can echo answer still
When the voice has ceased to cry ?

MUSIC, revealing and concealing, what
are you saying ? • When is your mes-
sage to be . made . known ? Your
changing, maddening, vague, sub-
lime message, whispered into the great
composers' ears—will it ever be interpreted,
told in a tongue all men can understand ?
Comes back, through the years, a grev
Monday, a crowd of little school-girls, in the
- stalls of a big theatre, and on the stage
Cowan’s orchestra, playing Wagner. The
music swelled, thundered, broke to pieces in
an ecstasy of power accomplished, sweetness
followed and found. Through the years a
child leans to the child beside her. “ What
does it make you. think of 1 ” she whispers,
breathlessly. And, through the years, the
other child slowly uncloses her tight-shut
eyes, comes back from Dreamland, and
replies in a stern, petrified voice—so magni-
ficently, so learnedly, so dashingly, that her
friend never dares to disclose her parallel—
“ The Rape o f the Sabines ! ”
Little one ! making music mean a remote
, story, painfully construed from Livy, Book
, I, that very day; and you [ child with a sweet
story to tell, hut never told, of how the
orchestra had been playing to you of flowers
and birds and rain and lightning and sun-
shine —you two small ones ! you are only two
out of a great world of men and women—yes,
and children too —trying to translate music
into meanings that sometimes creep into
Words (not always, perhaps, grandiloquently
as thb Sabines) —but oftenest stay hidden,
and- remain for ever hidden, embryo mean-
ings away at the back of; the thoughts that
never, come near to life, never become one
round living thought, to carry and cling to
all a lifetime.
Do you know that Prelude written about
a Raindrop ?
A raindrop is beating against a window,
one Autumn.evening, in Corsica. Chopin is
there, inside the room. Somewhere near,
but not beside him, is—perhaps . . . Chopin
listens, listens, and the raindrop beats
against the window. It beats until the poet
catches it, in all its haunting melancholy.
And the tender Prelude—a sob, a heartache,
a caught breath (do you remember how that
Prelude, every now and then, catches its
breath ?), a sweetness so sorrowful that one
can hardly bear it—images the lonely even-
ing, Autumn, Corsica, Chopin himself, and
the raindrop beating, beating, on the window-
pane—images and reveals in music that
tender picture, and the sound of that haunt-
ing raindrop, never to fade.
To hear Chopin play that simple Prelude !
. . . Ah, vain wish ! unless in angel-land the
music shall be classic.
Listen. ... Marche Funfebre. . . . Chopin
making music of the Dead for the Living
now.
Hurry ! Let us pass the opening chords,
solemn and slow, heavy as with crape. No
meaning for us in the great, pompous,
serious, crash, crash, crash of every Funeral
March. Borne, borne, b’ome, cries Beethoven.
Borne, borne, borne, cries Handel. Ah, my
Chopin, even you . . .
Even in childhood, when we reverenced as
.well as loved, there was nothing noble or
true in those great home, homes. “ The Dead
March in ‘ Saul ’ ” fell victim to a childish
trick. When the place came for Jffie big
crash, the child at the piano would step on a
hassock, and rise up and sit down on all the
bass notes three times, solemnly. Yea, and
home made that way was magnificent.
But stop at the paean, and the love song
that follows the crape wreathed chords.
“Beautiful Mother with sqft feet, ever
gliding near.” Chopin knew a finer, truer
story of Death than those pompous opening
chords set oat Lh tell. In Ural; high, frail
melody is the real love song, the wounds
healed, the ache satisfied, death and love
indissolubly one.
Is this, to you, the revelation of Chopin’s
Funeral March ? In its high, sweet, far-
away voice it tells that Love is Death. Only
Death can wound as Love can wound, can
cherish as Love would cherish, can silence
and smother and soothe, and embrace etern-
ally, eternally, world without end, as Love
longs to, vainly, vainly . . .
T hat is what they are doing in Chopin’s
Funeral March, all lovers. They are dying,
which is better, and was always intended,
and is beautiful and was alviays intended.
No crape, no tears, for what was always
intended.
One god and his name is Chopin—Chopin !
Chopin who wrote only for the pianoforte !
A pale-faced Pole, who but once or twice
climbed the heights of orchestra, content to
compose for one limited instrument only all
his life !
Ah, Chopin ! god of amber grapes and kisses,
Pale King of misty soul worlds, Lord of love ,
’ Mage of all jon tim, yearilim f mystery, " '
I ears and religion, joy and solitude.
And that Nocturne in C Minor, does it tell
you how—
To-night, to-night, in agony
My soul rebelled.
I craved the solace of your hair,
Ached for your hands, and voice and eyes,
And cried for that rebellious mouth,
That knows to cure my spirits drouth.
To-night! To-night! The mystery
Is unexplained.
I thought I had put by the Past.
Knowing your life was not for me
I thought I had burned all my ships,
And lo ! those red. rebellious Ups.
It is always something like this that
Chopin is saying. So intimate, so human . . .
Chopin never scolds. Beethoven growls
and is didactic by pages ; Mozart is proper ;
Mendelssohn moralises ; Grieg is unconven-
tional but goody at heart; Handel preaches ;
Bach, dear old Bach, laughs in his sleeve,
and cares not a fig for anything ; and Chopin
is with him. Chopin never scolds. Chopin
lets you do anything.
Chopin and George Sand ! Did she ever
say these words to him —and did he agree
and play her a dazzling insouciant waltz as
she said to him gravely, “We never reach
the highest in art, in literature, in emotion,
in thought, in anything, till we come to love
people not for anything they are, or do, or
seem to be, but only for themselves.”
Everywhere in Chopin you can hear that
echoing.
That waltz with a hushed air for the left
hand breaking into a passionate protest, then
back to the golden lento, always says to me ;
All, all is over 1
Do not speak.
From cover to cover
Most white and 'weak,
She lies in silence. And would you weep
Because she sleeps, wn.o longed so to sleep?
A bird is wounded,
And soon it dies.
One cry resounded,
A cry of cries.
Come ! let us weep for this broken thing
That clung to sunlight with passionate icing.
All, all is over !
Do not speak.
From cover to cover
Most white and weak,
She lies in silence. You would not weep
Because she sleeps, who longed so to sleep.
And Beethoven ? What, no word for.
Beethoven ! Listen to my Nocturne that
tells . . .
Come back, Winter ! Come back to me,
Dear White Winter of long ago.
Others sing of Summer and Spring,
My song rings of the Ice and Snow.
Then Beethoven was priest and king,
Ah, the surge of his symphonies I
Ever under and over all
Bang the wash of the wild North Seas.
Chopin reigns in the heart to-day ;
Old Beethoven has fallen back ;
Spring and Summer have wearied him,
So he followed his lonely track
Up where forests of primal pine
Boar their heart-aches into the wind.
Winter went from my soul. I passed,
Waking into my Chopin days.
Chopin, Chopin 1 Ah, Wanderer,
What hast thou in thine hands for me t
Boses—roses and violets —
Death smiles up through their company.
One note only is never touched :
Bose of Childhood thou canst not weave
Into the mesh of thy music-looms.
Child-lips laughing, and eyes that grieve
Never move to thy melodies, ‘
Never dance to thy scherzo strings,
Lovers, dreamy and decadent —
Never note of a young voice rings.
• • • •
.. . V
Master! fragile and passionate,
Let me sound but one note with thee :
Sing that youth but a waiting place,
Dreamy dawn of a Day to be.
And . . . But shall I withhold the Yet ?
Yet is the essence of True Poetry. Let
the Yet stay.
Yet, 0 Winter, come back to me 1
Dear white T Vinter of long ago,
When Beethoven was priest and king,
And we battled with wind and snow.
Fiercely fighting for Asphodel,
Child and lover and man in one,
Ere the shadows of Chopin fell. . .
There is something missing there, some-
thing that needed a word of prose. It was
not possible to put in verse the great griev-
ance against mighty Beethoven. His terrible
dum-duinmy-dumming, dum-dummy-dum-
ming in the bass.
Only for that—but no, Chopin satisfies.
Let Chopin- stay.

The war has produced better poetry than Kip-
ling’s trash. E. W. Hornung has in Bond. Spec-
tator these sincere verses, which give a finer
impression of him than his prose gives. They
commemorate the soldier’s-death of three old
schoolmates —
When I lie dying in my bed,
A grief to wife, and child, and friend—
How I shall grudge you gallant dead
Your sudden, swift, heroic end !
Dear hands will minister to me,
Dear eyes denote each shallower breath:
You had your battle-cries, you three,
To cheer and charm you to your death.
You did not wane from worse to worst,
Under coarse drug or futile knife,
But in one grand mad moment burst
From glorious life to glorious Life . . .
Ah ! gallant three, too young to die !
The pity of it all endures.
Yet, in my own poor passing, I
Shall lie and long for such as yours.
This enshrines the fine old Viking disgust of “a
straw death—-a cow’s death ” —the death of
Tennyson with his Shakespeare on his breast and
the light from the stained window falling on his
face. Stevenson has put the same idea in the
close of his “ Aes Triplex ” essay—
Does not life go down with a better grace, foaming in
full body over a precipice, than miserably straggling to
an end in sandy deltas ?
If there is one thing more certain than another,
it is that Hornung’s heroes died in a shameful
attack on the liberties of a heroic little Republic.
But . . . they died fighting.

C. N. Baeyertz writes with regard to his review
of “Maoriland and Other Verses,” and the local
comment—
You refer to me as the “rather pedantic person who
edits The Triad (M.L.). My pedantry consists in spelling
the word rime correctly, and not incorrectly, rhyme. You
say “ Only pedants spell it rimes, defying overwhelming
Custom, that final arbiter.”
Mr. Baeyertz proceeds to quote at some length
from Skeat, Webster (1804), Chambers (1898),
Annandale (1899), and Webster’s “International,”
to show that rime is etymologically correct —which
nobody disputed. He does not quote the New
English Dictionary, though this helps him so far
as to say that the spelling rime, “is not that at
present favoured by the preponderance of usage,
but is intrinsically the best, and therefore is
recommended.” ( Preface, x.) Dr. Murray’s re-
mark applies also to ax, ioraxe ; and connexion, for
connection. Nevertheless, the “ preponderance of
usage ’ being so distinctly against ax and rime,
the employment of these spellings by a present-
day journalist is a mark of pedantry.
Mr. Baeyertz continues—
Now for my ignorance of grammar, and the unen-
lightened standpoint from which I regard poetry, deduced
from these lines quoted from mV review:
The line from “The Reaper” :
The world is drowsy, the winds asleep,
is ungrammatical. “ The winds is asleep ” !
Really, The 'Bookfellow ought to know the rule of
English-syntax violated by Mr. Adams in the above line.
Thus Maetzner : “ A compound sentence can only be con-
tracted when the subjects are both in the same number.”
Professor Hodgson also puts it very clearly thus : Some-
times a compound sentence—one, namely, that contains
two or more co-ordinate assertions—is put in contracted
form, one predicate having two or more subjects, e.g.,
“Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note ” [washeard].
Such contraction is only admissible where the subjects are
in the same number, since otherwise the rule of the con-
cord of subject and’verb is violated. This error, as will
be seen from the subjoined examples, is oftenest com-
mitted with the verb of incomplete predication 1 to be
“His diet was abstemious, his prayers [were] long and
fervent” . . . and so forth.
Pedantic fiddlesticks ! Did Maetzner and
Hodgson and Baeyertz never hear of ellipsis ?
one of the commonest figures in English. The
sentence quoted is possibly inelegant, but cer-
tainly not ungrammatical. To put an and in is to
prove Maetzner and co. dullards at once, as in
Pope’s—
When offers are disdained, and love denied.
, The Rape of the Lock, C. i.
[“ Love are denied ! ” might comment the pedant.
“Shocking! A scandalous rattling of the dry
bones of Maetzner ! Why did n’t Pope write
‘ loves ’” ?] And if P. had written—
When offers are disdained, truth thwarted, love denied,
that would have been equally correct English.
Mr. Baeyertz continues —
Mr. Adams might have written the line correctly, tihus :
“ The world is drowsy,' the wind asleep,”
as here the two subjects are in the same number. The Book-
fellow cannot urge poetic licence, for in the line there is no
poetry. The line is merely commonplace. It contains no
intrinsic merit to excuse the slovenly construction. I
shouldvlike The Bookfellow to show how my criticism
of the syntax of this line shows the unenlightened stand-
point from which I regard poetry. It is easy to make un-
supported statements : it is not always so easy to justify
the statements by proof. If he feels in an explaining
mood, he might likewise explain what he means by the
following elegant sentence :
“ The Triad scores—sometimes from Adams, sometimes
from itself.”
Also in the sentence—
. the poet distils from uncouth words the essence
of melodious emotion,”
Why from “ uncouth words ” either in the etymological
meaning or in the present-day significance of ‘ ‘ uncouth” ?
Mr. Baeyertz’s “unenlightened standpoint” is
exhibited when, as critic, he passes by the poetical
value of a verse in order to pick imaginary holes
in the syntax. It is further exhibited when he
argues that the plea of poetic license cannot be
raised, ‘ ‘ for in the line there is no poetry ’’—since
poetry is never expected by enlightened people to
reside in single lines detached from the context.
It is still further exhibited by his incapacity to
comprehend the very plain English which is the
ground of his final objections.

Joseph Pennell on Ruskin—
It is not that his art criticism was right; it was usually
wrong. But he believed in it, he fought for his belief,
and he backed his belief with his fortune. And there is
the whole point. If John Ruskin had not been a rich
man he never would have been heard of. No publisher,
no paper, no magazine would have printed his books, his
articles, or his letters. And yet they were printed ? Of
course they were, because he paid for them himself. Yet
people read them ? Of course they did, and they would
read the work of as strong a man to-day, if he was with
us, but editors would not print it. The whole reason for
John Ruskin’s taking up art criticism was to preserve and
increase and boom his father’s collection of Turner’s pic-
tures. That this defence of Turner and his father
happened to be written in the most brilliant, the most
burning English was an accident. And the same thing
was, true of his defence of the Pre-Raphaelites. He
believed in their work, and he boomed it with his pocket-
book, and backed his opinions with his masterly English.

The recent death, of R. W. Dixon robs England’
of a sweet and graceful minor-poet uneompre-
hended by the multitude. His verse was low-
toned and frail-fibred, rather an inspiration than,
an effort, rather a breathing than a writing; often
delicately beautiful in phrase and emotion. An.
example heads this page. Mr. Dixon was a clergy-
man of the Church of England, and at his death
(aet. 66) lion, canon of Carlisle and vicar of Wark-
wortli.
“The Australasian Stage Annual” is a new
shilling publication, effectively produced. Its
theatrical record is useful, and could advantage-
ously be extended. Some verses and prose
sketches over two or three well-known names are
included; but the only contribution of any ac-
count is Victor Daley’s “ flayers,” whereof the
first and last verses run—
And after all—-arid after all—
Our passionate prayers, and sighs, and tears,
Is life a reckless carnival.... ;
And are they lost, our golden years ? . . .
[Ah no !] though Time should cease to flow,
And stars their courses should forget—
There lives a grey-haired Romeo
Who loves a golden Juliet.
Dent & Co. are adding a translation of Hugo to
their Dumas. Eor those who do not read French
the result—as suggested in the initial volumes of
“Notre Dame” —will be very satisfactory.
ForC.M.J. and others : There are two handy-
books of Ruskin which should be soon obtain-
able in Australia —J. A. Hobson’s study of his
social-reforming side (Nisbet, 10s. 6d.), and M. H.
Spielmann’s more critical sketch (Cassell, 55.)
There is no. mistaking the great influence on
modern war exercised by the Press, aided by the
telegraph. The British generals in Africa have
had to play to the gallery : during the Indian
Mutiny (for example) they played to win.
RUSKIN. '
He thirsted —as a thirsty land for rain—
For Beauty, and for Good as men for gain ;
Now may he drink of the immortal tide,
Ever athirst, and ever satisfied.
F. W. Bourdillon.
(The theology being granted for the sake of the
truth and the poetry.)
All gods love flattery. No deity will look at
you unless you grovel in the dust. Even the so-
called Lord’s Prayer, which is supposed to be the
perfection of simplicity and efficiency, begins with
flattery and ends with flattery. The practical
petition is in the middle, like the meat between
the slices of bread in a sandwich.— G. W. Foote.
Amb. G. comments :
In a rather belated and tired sort of way I venture to
suggest that, hadßoderic Quinn never written “ Margaret,”
Victor Hugo would never have written “ Toilers of the
Sea.”

The Fable of the Fox and the Grow.
“ Well, what d’ ye think about the war now?” said the
Fox.
The Crow vouchsafed no reply.
“ The doctors would make it warm for Kugelmann if
they could catch him, would n’t they ? ” said the Fox, and
still the Crow was silent, although clearly suffering.
“ Strange thing this about Mayor Marris and the bu-
bonic plague ? ” said the Fox, finally.
Hereupon-the Crow opened his beak to talk and let fall
the cheese, which the Fox promptly made off with.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
a
MEDICATOR.
/CATARRH is inflammation of the
'- y ' lining membrane of the nose
and adjoining passages. If this in-
flammation is not arrested it invades
the passages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the sight and
hearing, destroys the sense of taste
and smell, renders the breath offen-
sive, breaks down the arffected
tissues, consumes the nasal ear-
tileges, and rots away the small
frontal bones of the skull. The putrid
discharge passing through the lungs
and stomach causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want relief and
cure ? If so, try our great remedy. It
has no equal.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her Heart.
If that be foul I have esteemed fair,
If that be bitter I have thought so sweet,
My eyes can see not rightly anywhere,
And black is white, simplicity deceit :
If she be not that which she seems, how may
A man have faith in woman’s fealty ?
The sullied night were beautiful as day,
The strongest fact a villain forgery !
Though all men else said she was false, I’d swear
They lied, who know her more than any do —
I who have read her heart, that volume rare,
And seen no word there but was sweet and true:
So many a page with my love-story writ,
If she were false I had not been in it!
N.S.W.
R. CRAWFORD.
God’s Stepchildren.
Poor loveless waifs ! All day their hopes have
soared
Around the pleasures of the banquet-hall;
They’ve waited patiently the welcome call
To take their places at the loaded board,
Till dusk —and then a sudden, nameless dread
Affrights them: “Father! Father! You forget!”
But, frowning sullenly, He pities not,
And sends the m with a hungry heart to bed.
N.Q.
VON KOTZE.
Hymn of the Reformers.
By the bodies and minds and souls that rot in a
common sty,
In the city’s offal-holes, where the dregs of its
horrors lie ;
By the prayers that bubble out, but never ascend
to God,
We swear the tyrants of earth to rout with tongue
and with pen and sword !
By the child that sees the light where the pestilent
air stagnates;
And the woman worn and white who under the
street-lamp waits ;
By the horror of vice that thrives in the dens of
the wretphed poor,
We swear to strike when the time arrives for all
that is good and pure.
By the rights that were always ours—the rights
that we ne’er enjoyed—
And the gloomy cloud that lowers on the brows of
the unemployed ;
By the struggling mothers and wives and the girls
on the streets of sin,
We swear to r s':rike when the time arrives, for our
kind and our kith and kin.
By our burning hate for men who rob us of ours by
right,
And banish to slum and stew the poor from the
sun and light,
And the hellborn law that drives the exile o’er sea
to roam,
We swear to strike when the time arrives for
Happiness, Hearth, and Home.
By the little of manhood left in a world of want
and sin,
By the rift in the dark clouds reft where the light
still struggles in,
By the love that scarce survives in a stream that
is sluggish and thin,
We swear to work till the time arrives, for our-
selves and our kith and kin.
The little love may dry in its stream that scarcely
flows,
The little of manhood die, and the rift in the dark
clouds close,
And hope may vanish from earth, and all that is
pure and bright—
We swear to strike ere that time has birth with
the whole of our gathered might.
N.S.W.
HENRY LAWSON.
A Peerless Pearl
Q.
A peerless pearl is mine,
Pearl of beauty all divine ;
Mine eyes are ever beaming,
My glance is ever gleaming
On this peerless pearl of mine,
Pearl of beauty all divine.
A dainty dove is mine,
Feathered soft and fair and fine;
Oft she nestles on my shoulder,
Oft my yearning arms enfold her
Like the tendrils of the vine,—
Darling, dainty dove of mine !
A ruddy rose is mine,
Dipped .in morning’s dewy wine ;
Oft my thirsty lips have sipped in
Her sweet nectar ; often dipped in
Her dear cup of dewy wine; —
Ruddy, ruddy rose of mine I
An Angel pure is mine,
Pure as Mary Mother’s shrine ;
O’er my breast is furled her pinion,
In my heart is her dominion ;
Rose and dove and pearl of mine.
Angel pure as Mary’s shrine.

SATURDAY, MARCH 24, 1900.
The One Honest Jingo.
Of course, the ready reply of the mean man will be, why
should we pay our men when the mother country has
offered to pay for us? Well, I have known just such mean
individuals who would allow their parents to impoverish
themselves in paying l for things for their sapless progeny,
which they (the sapless ones) could have well afforded to
have paid for themselves, but the friends of the old folk
never held such youngsters in much estimation, nor ap-
praised their character for generosity at a very high
standard. It is an amiable thing for a generous mother
to make a liberal offer which she cannot well afford ; but
it does not follow that her sturdy, full-grown sons—richer
than herself—should accept that offer. At any rate, if
they do they should not stand stroking their budding
whiskers, pluming themselves on what fine fellows they
are, and how readily they render assistance to the “ dear
old mother.”
If we allow the British Government to pay the
wages in addition to all the other expenses of
our Bushmen, our troops will become little better
than “hired mercenaries.” Hungarians, Spaniards,
and Greeks have offered to fight in British ranks;
of course on the assumption that Great Britain would
pay their wages and other expenses, which offers were
respectfully declined Either we are a part and parcel of
the Empire, or we are not. If we are, it is our bounden
duty to bear a fair share of the burdens of empire, as we
equally participate in the advantages. If we do not form
part of the Empire, then we may with a good grace hire
out a number of our men to fight foy a friendly Power,
but let us for ever after have the honesty to cease to claim
nationhood with our brothers over the sea. Our past
arrangements with the mother country with reference to
our troops already despatched have been liberal enough
to us when we fairly and honestly gauge our legitimate
responsibilities, but the Governments and the people of
these colonies must, in my opinion, have very pliant con-
sciences if they do not insist on, at least, relieving the
British taxpayer and taking the burden on themselves of
paying the same proportion of our men’s wages in the
forthcoming contingent that they have done with respect
to those already sent away.
For the sake of comparison, let us take the year 1898,
under a peace regime, when the expenditure on the Im-
perial army was £22,359,599, equal to 11s. ljd. per head of
population, while the expenditure on the navy was
£24,733,822, amounting to 12s. 3id. per head, or a total
expenditure per head for defence purposes of £1 3s. sd.
for each man, woman, and child in Great Britain and Ire-
land. Now, for the same year, our total expenditure for
defence, including permanent forces, volunteers, fortifica-
tions, and our pro rata contribution towards the mainten-
ance of the warships on the Australian station, only
amounted to £270,586, or the sum of 4s. per head of our
population, as against £1 3s. sd. per head of Great
Britain. But, by way of helping us over the finan-
cial stile, we received the sum of £1,976,816 as our gross
land revenue, and, if we deduct from this amount the
total expenditure on our Lands and Mines Departments,
for the same year— viz., & 457,512 —it leaves us a net sum
of £1,519,000 to enable us to pay this defence vote of
£270,586. In other words, we received a clear net profit
of £1 2s. 6d. per head land revenue, and were called upon
to contribute out of that amount only 4s. per head by
way of defence expenditure in protecting that source of
revenue, as well as our own precious persons. Now, if
the mother country were placed in a similarly fortunate
position, she would have received over £45,000,000, which
would have gone a long way towards paying her
£47,000,000 defence expenditure. I sometimes think that
the British taxpayer must regret that in handing over t
us these vast and valuable estates, the Imperial Govern
ment did not retain some share of the revenues to be de-
rived from them. The British mother, however, was ever
a generous one to her offspring.—Henry Copeland, the
fine old doggy English gentleman who said that Britain
must “ blood her pups.”
* * * •
The above remarks are interesting mainly
because, in them, the fine old doggy Jingo
puts into plain words a question which other
Jingoes, less downright and not so doggy,
have shirked. Any number of Imperialists
have said within the last six wild and woolly
months that we are an integral portion of the
empire. Copeland says so, too, with the
addendum: “Let us act as such.” Any
number of Jingoes have said that the man
by the Murray or the Snowy River is as
much interested in the defence of the whole
empire as the man by the Severn or the
Tyne, and Copeland adds : ‘ ‘ Therefore let
him take an equal share in the defence of
the empire.” Probably seven Australians
out of ten have been prepared, during the
last wild half-year, not only to asseverate
that it was this country’s duty to do its
share in protecting the British dominions,
but all seven of them to get on top of the
man who was of a contrary opinion, and
kick his ear off', and break his window after-
wards. Copeland proposes that instead of
breaking any window, or kicking off any ear,
or yelling about our desire to do our share in
holding up the big unwieldy banner of Great
and Greater Britain, we should simply do our
share. And doing our share doesn’t moan
having a spasm in time of actual war, and
slowly gathering together, at a colossal rate
of pay, a mob of half or less than half
trained men, and getting them to the scene
of action when the campaign is half
over, and after Britain has borne the
heat and burden of the day. If the
rest of the empire did its share that way,
the Boers would have been in Durban
and Capetown before the first excited squad
had tumbled on board ship at London, and
there would have been no ship ready for
them to go on board. If the Jingo crowd is
in earnest and isn’t a mere vaporing mob
bounding insanely on its foolish hat—if it
really means what it says when it talks about
wanting to 'identify itself with the mother
country and bear its proportion of the
mother-country’s cares and burdens—then it
has to face quite a different kind of re-
sponsibility. If Australia is going, in
proportion to its population, to bear its
section of the Imperial responsibilities, it
must keep something like 30,000 well-trained
and well-armed soldiers always ready, with
another 30,000 volunteers or militia or yeo-
manry behind them, also huge stores of
ammunition and up-to-date artillery. Also,
it must pay some £2,000,000 a year towards
the British fleet, or else maintain a fleet of
about 30 good armoured vessels on its own
account.
* ♦ * *
The bill would run to about £4,000,000 a
year for the six provinces of Australia and
Tasiflauia, and New South Wales's share
would be about £1,500,000 a year. Among
all the Jingoes and Jingo politicians who
have thrown up a loud incoherent bell-topper
about how it is this country’s duty to take
its fair share of the weight of the empire,
and to stand by the mother-country, and to
identify itself with the interests of “the great
mother-land, Copeland from Yorkshire is
the first who has gone into details and looked
the bill squarely in the eye. He is the only
one who has lived up to his creed, and had
the courage of his opinions, and proposed
dealing with the matter in a concrete form
instead of shrieking about it in the abstract.
And The Bulletin likes Copeland for
it. It cordially admires a misguided man
who has the courage of his misguidedness.
Until it met Copeland it had only encoun-
tered among the Jingo brotherhood mis-
guided men who hadn’t any courage worth
mentioning. They were an abject lot, who
clamoured about what should be done and
dared not propose doing it. Copeland,
rising with his bill for £4,000,000 a year in
his large, brown hand, is a man among a lot
of pitiable weeds.
* ♦ * *
In some respects, no doubt, Copeland’s
case won’t stand serious inspection. It is
absurd to advance as a reason why we should
bear a fair proportion of the empire’s burdens
that “ we equally participate in the advan-
tages.” We don’t “equally participate in
the advantages ” by a long way. Britain
has a share, by its veto over Australian
legislation, in governing us; we have no
share in governing Britain. We have no
voice in making the wars to which it seems
to be agreed we should contribute. We
have no control over military management.
The British Government may adopt a line of
policy that will lay the empire, Australia.
included, in ruins, and Australia has no say,
not even a whisper, in the matter. But,
doubtless, that can all be remedied. If Aus-
tralia is willing to be really and truly a part
of the empire, and to take up its proportion
of the Imperial cares as. a steady job, some
form of Imperial Federation must needs be
devised whereby Australia will be repre-
sented, according to its population, in the
Imperial Parliament. And there is hardly a
doubt that Britain will seriously set about
devising some such scheme if Australia
announces its readiness to bear the respon-
sibilities abovementioned. In fact, if there
is anything more than gas and hypocrisy in
the Jingo cry about this country’s resolve
hereafter to carry its due and proportionate
end of the load, there must be Imperial
Federation. Australia can’t undertake to
share Britain’s wars and war-bills as a
regular tiling without having some interest
in the making or unmaking of these wars,
and it can’t have any effective voice or in-
terest without being permanently repre-
sented in the Parliament which decides on
war questions, or which makes the Govern-
ment that decides these questions. Any
other arrangement would wreck the great
principle of Representative Government and
knock both feet from under our cherished
Parliamentary institutions. And one thing
at least can be said for Imperial Federation.
Considering how Australia has gone on
during the last six months it deserves it.
# * * *
Whether Australia, in pursuance of the
new and lofty policy of standing by its
aged parent, and identifying itself with the
Empire, and no longer meanly shirking its
part of the Imperial burdens, should take
over its share (which would be, perhaps,
£40,000,000) of the British national debt, is
another question. Australia’s own debt was
incurred solely for Australia’s own benefit,
and is mostly represented by assets which
are Australia’s sole property, so this country
can’t ask Britain to share that unless it
shares the assets with Britain also. But the
British debt is solely a war-debt incurred in
the real or supposed interests of the Empire
at large. Our British forefathers were re-
sponsible for making it, and each of them
was responsible for his own share of the
principal and interest—till he meanly ran
away from his creditors by coming out to
Australia, and basely dodged the duty of
sending back his share of the interest by
annual post-office order. And we took
advantage of our fathers’ base dishonesty.
Even Henry Copeland, so far as The Bulle-
tin knows, evades his responsibility to the
place of his birth, and doesn’t remit his yearly
contribution. This is a serious matter, and
if the principles of abstract justice are to be
followed out on a strictly Jingo basis, The
Bulletin is astonished at the mean evasions
of people from whom better things might
have been expected.
• * * *
If Australia is going to be Jingo, then
let it be honestly Jingo. If the Aus-
tralian is going to be a British patriot,
and not his own patriot, let him be
the real article and not a painted and padded
fraud and a plated imitation. For the last
four months the average individual has been
unable to hear himself speak for the Voice
of the People—a strangely husky and beery
voice as of one suffering from great excite-
ment or from drink—crying out that this
continent was going hereafter to take up its
fair and honest hunk of the burden of
empire, and that it was its duty to stand by
the motherland simply because it was the
motherland, and ask no questions. If
the majority feels that way, and if
the majority knows its own mind, then
the question is settled. The majority rules.
But this paper asks the majority to be
honest. If it is Australia’s duty to go into
the business at all, then it is its duty to do
it, not once but always, and to take its fair
and square share of the load according to its
population and resources—not to take a
mere fraction of it and make as much noise
as if it was carrying the whole lot. That
means putting up some £4,000,000 a year
towards the empire’s military and naval
expenditure, and keeping some 30,000 regu-
lar troops in a constant state of efficiency
with large reserves bihind them. It ought
also to mean taking up the proportion (some
forty millions) of the empire’s war debt
which our fathers meanly shirked by clearing
out and which some of us shirked personally
in the same way, but perhaps even the most
honest Jingo isn’t quite prepared for that
kind of honesty. Yet at least it is safe to
say that the Jingo who talks about our duty
to the mother-land but isn’t prepared to
advocate doing that duty in full, even at the
cost of £4,000,000 a year, is a fraud and
a brassy hypocrite. And the only one
of them all up to date that doesn’t
look like a fraud apd a brassy hypo-
crite is Henry Copeland. As regards
Lyne and M‘Lean and Seddon and Neil
Lewis and Forrest and Holder and their
followers, who preach the doctrine of Im-
perial responsibility, yet dare' not accept the
responsibility, all honest Jingoes (if there
are any besides Henry Copeland) should
aim at them the ancient egg of scorn and
the defunct cat of reproach.
* * * *
And yet The Bulletin is disappointed in
Henry Copeland. The fact that he doesn’t
advocate the taking over by this country of
a proportional share of the British war-
debt, incurred almost wholly in the interests
or alleged interests of the empire at large,
shows a tendency even on his part to shirk
his responsibilities. And Henry Copeland,
like The Bulletin, is a Protectionist. Pro-
tection is the doctrine of remorseless com-
mercial war, waged in our own exclusive
interests against all outside rivals, of
whom Britain is the chief. It accords
well enough with The Bulletin’s doctrine
that, this country should fight for its
own hand, but the Jingo who preaches it
commits a shameful, sinful perversion of his
own doctrines. Protection is a policy
whereby we tax the products of the beloved
mother-land which lets in most of our pro-
ducts free—by which we do our little best
to damage her interests, and block her
commerce, and wreck her industries so
that our industries may grow on the
ruins of an indulgent parent. The fact
that Australia isn’t big enough yet to
do Britain any serious damage in this mattei
makes no difference in the intention—which
is to smite Britain severely on the pocket for
our own benefit. If Henry Copeland and
all of his way of thinking are not willing to
extend to Britain as large a measure of
I reetrade as Britain extends to us, and
hang the consequences, then their principles
are subservient to their interest, and there
is no good in their crying in the market-
place for fair-dealing (from the Jingo stand-
point) between Australia and Britain. The
Bulletin is disappointed in Henry Cope-
land. He seems the one courageous
and politically honest man in a very large
crowd whose political dishonesty is un-
speakable, and whose lack of anything
even dimly resembling the courage of their
alleged opinions is calculated to raise a
shudder of disgust. And yet his courage
and political honesty are only comparative ;
when his Jingoism runs against his old-
established fiscal views he is apparently as
ready to throw the beloved mother-land
overboard as anybody else. Probably his
reply will be that he doesn’t see why devo-
tion to England shouldn’t go along with a
joyous readiness to do all possible damage
to England’s commerce per medium of a
hostile tariff—a tariff raised by an ungrateful
child to help blot out an indulgent parent.
But if he was a thoroughly honest Jingo he
would see it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tasmania’s General Election.
Tasmanian politics get no better very fast. A
general election happened along in a lonely sort of
way the week before last, and panned out some
curious results. The Lewis-Bird Ministry an-
nounced no policy whatever, and nobody seemed
to think a policy necessary. The only member of
the Ministry who had to fight for his seat was
Lands-and-Works Muloahy, one of the six mem-
bers returned for Hobart under the Hake system.
Had Muloahy been a member for some small coun-
try constituency, like his colleagues, Treas. Bird
and Premier Lewis, he, too, would most probably
have had a walk-over. And this is how the Hake
system resulted in Hobart: There were ten candi-
dates for six seats. Among the ten was Captain
E. T. Miles, who was lately compelled to resign
his seat and portfolio as Minister of Lands in the
Braddon Cabinet, in consequence of a sweep-
ing condemnation by a Special Committee
of the House of Assembly of his part
in the Strahan Marine Board scandals.
The chief Judges on the aforesaid special
committee were present Premier Lewis and,
present Lands and Works Minister Muloahy,
formerly bosom friends and political pals of the
condemned Miles. With the astuteness of an
old general Miles ran his election on the war-cry,
“Down with Muloahy; the man who wrongly
condemned Miles in order to collar his billet as
Minister of Lands !” In a country where the
folks are too tired to think, and where sympathy
for a fallen comrade is much stronger than hate
of shady transactions, such a slogan was effective.
Instead of the Minister gaining place of honor
at the top of the poll, he had to be content
with third position. And Miles was also elected,
Vulgar Lout and Vulgar God.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the Sabbath bells are pealing and the
Sabbath hymns intone—
(o, the luckless, luckless heathen with his idols
made of stone!)
When the spirit of the Preacher riseth up on
wings of prayer,
And the soul of him who worshippeth is rapt in
visions fair,
There’s a lump of clay a-kneeling—in the Shrine
there bends a clod—
’Tis the Vulgar Lout a-pleading with his Little
Vulgar God.
When the pure of heart are yearning to their
Priest, the Purified,
When the Lowly beg the Lowly that he purge
them of their Pride,
There’s a creature making bargains with the Lord
who lives on high,
“ If I give thee silver shekels—wilt thou pass my
trespass by ?
Shall I prosper in my selling ?—wilt thou aid me
with a nod ? ”
—’Tis the Vulgar Lout a-haggling with his Little
Vulgar God !
Never dream hath he of Glories in the Glamour
Land to be ;
Little maketh he of Mansions by the gleaming:
Jasper Sea ;
For the things of Earth are dearer to his sordid
vision far
Than the honey-dews of Aidenn and the light of
every star.
So he whispers : “ Let me flourish as a fat ling on
the soa—
I, a Vulgar Lout, am pleading with my Little
Vulgar God! ”
For in sooth the Lord who liveth, He will hearken
to the call
(O ! He marks the Stocks a-rising as he sees the
Sparrow’s fall!)
He is potent to reward us if we come with willing
feet,
And the Cash upon his altars sendeth up a savour
sweet;
And to them who spare not incense He is sparing
with His rod,
And the Vulgar Lout is pleasing to the Little
Vulgar God !
Yes —we make Him in our image—yonder God we
all adore ;
He is even just as we are, if we read his record
o’er;
He’s a Slayer red with slaughter to the sullen
brood of Cain.
To the pedlar He’s a Pedlar with a mighty greed
of gain ;
He’s a huge eternal Schemer to the tribe who plan
and plod—
To the Vulgar Lout and puny He’s a Little
Vulgar God !

S fcr & returning rfirn
to Parliament the electors have practically de

of “conduct unbecoming a member of
Parliament ” was an unjust judge. % returning
Premier Lewis unopposed, and Minister Mul-
S and every other member of the Miles
Committee by big majorities the electors have
declared exactly the opposite. Electors are now
nuzzled at the result of their own handiwork ;
hardlv a Tasmanian seems to know where he are.
Parrino- Miles, of course. He knows he is again
in Parliament, and declares his intention of wiping
the report of the Special Committee off the
records of the House. But as Parliament is com-
posed chiefly of the same members as it was when
the report of the Committee was adopted, the task
Miles has set himself looks absurdly impossible.
To wipe out the damaging record Miles
will need to wipe out Premier Lewis, Minister
Mulcahy, and all their followers, and as
the polling results show that the Captain
stands lower in public estimation than
the men he proposes to expunge, the contract
looks too large for even a skilled contractor like
Miles to undertake. It is a thousand to one no
one-member constituency would have returned the
Parliamentarfly-condemned Miles as its member.
It would be too public a breach of conventionality
for any electorate to stagger under. But in a six-
member electorate strange individuals drift in
casually at the tail of the procession, or are blown
in by the-wind of circumstances. At least 2500
Hobart electors can now honestly declare they
didn’t vote for the discredited old sea-dog; in
fact, they voted dead against him, but he got
there just the same.

The Minister who Wasn’t Quarantined.
The shindy which has raged throughout Sydney
about the neglect of the Lyne Government
to quarantine Minister See’s premises in
Sussex-street, which premises are partly adjacent
to and partly underneath those of Dudley, the
first plague victim, doesn’t seem to amount to so
very much after all. At all events, the same
policy appears to have been followed right through
—that of quarantining the house, store, or hotel
where the plague broke out, and letting adjacent
premises not actually connected therewith take
their chance. Minister See’s place wasn’t con-
nected with Dudley’s by doors or stairs, and the
case only differed from others because it was
separated from the plague by a floor instead of by
a partition. If the division had been some per-
pendicular boards nothing would have been said,
but it being some horizontal boards there was
trouble. Premier Lyne certainly interfered
in another case, and didn’t interfere in See’s
case, which proceeding gave rise to much strong
complaint, but the two cases don’t seem by any
means on all fours. When Dudley fell ill his
premises—those where the plague had actually
developed—were quarantined. Later on it was
proposed to abandon the practice of quarantining
even the place where the plague actually broke out,
and then Premier Lyne interfered and insisted on
other places being treated as Dudley’s had been.
He doesn’t appear to have made fish of See and
fowl of anybody else. Anyhow, judged by results,
the quarantining of the premises adjacent to Dud-
ley’s would have been sheer uselessness. The
plague isn’t spreading along streets from house to
house. There is a case here and then another, not
next door, but a mile or half-a-mile away. Appar-
ently the place next door to a plague case is quite
as safe, if it is kept clean, as the one ten streets
distant. The theory appears to be that Lyne
should have treated his Ministerial colleague with
exceptional severity to avert any suspicion that he
was treating him with exceptional leniency, but
that is mere playing to the gallery. Apparently it
isn’l isolation, but vigorous cleaning, that is wanted.
Dudley’s premises are alleged to have been very
much in want of cleaning, but it hasn’t been
alleged that Minister See’s were in the same
state. If they were in good condition then there
is no reasonable cause of complaint; when Dudley
took the disease it was much more important to
look after the dirty places three miles away than
the reasonably clean ones next door or even
underneath. No doubt Sussex-street and many
other like streets are a standing danger, and if the
Ministry could see its way to utterly demolish and
rebuild them, and a great deal of disgraceful
wharf property as well, it would make Sydney
much safer and also more beautiful to look upon.
That is what is being done in Bombay. But
destruction is one thing and quarantine another.
The difference is just that between cremating the
dead bubonic rat and leaving it there with a
policeman to watch it, so that the germs may
blow on to the policeman. Even if all Sussex-
street and the adjacent thoroughfares had been
quarantined when Dudley fell ill, and isolated,
and guarded by 400 policemen for 400 days.
Sussex-street would still have been a danger-
ous place, and the diseased rat that grows so
plentifully in its ramshackle tenements, and which
will always grow there while the ramshackle tene-
ments stand, would have fled cheerfully between
the 800 feet of the 400 policemen to cary infection
elsewhere,

A Vision of Judgment.
A vision of the Moore Park (Sydney) garbage tip
by “The Father of a Family” in Australian
Star -
This place is not closed ; only this afternoon I counted
over 60 men, women, and children raking over the
rubbish, and the smell was something dreadful. From 6
o’clock in the morning until 5 o’clock in the afternoon the
men and women who rake the rubbish have a “ right,” a
paper signed by the Mayor of Sydney, After 5 o’clock the
place is open to anyone, and it is then that the large army
of ragpickers and children come. It is not safe for them
to come until the people who hold the rights go, for they
will drive them away, and sometimes beat and ill-treat
any interloper. The language indulged in by these rakers
is of the vilest description. Unfortunately many children
are attracted there to look for wood and patches out of
the drapers’ rubbish, also damaged toys, and, what is
worst of all, half-decayed fruit. While I was at the tip a
big load of rotten bananas came, and the children gathered
great heaps of them, and sat down eating them.
Among this load were found dead rats. Nobody took the
slightest notice of them. I did my best to get the children
away, but I was only hooted for my trouble. The children
then commenced throwing the rats about, which seemed
to greatly amuse the dissolute-looking men who were
filling up their bags with filthy rags and bones. These
rags were wet; they would be hid away until next morn-
ing, then dried in the sun, carried into the city, from
which they had been carted, and sold to make into beds.
Having a “ right” entitles the holder to rig up a shanty
for himself and family, and around these shanties he packs
up all he finds during the week. On Saturday it is
carted off to market. Go and see for yourself if this is not
true. Some of these “ rakers ” are strong, able-bodied
men ; so are some of the women. Some are old and
feeble. These people live rent free, and get the water
they use from the drinking fountain on Randwick-road.-
It is a lasting disgrace to the City Council that such
shanties should exist in such a place, and that children
should be born and brought up in them. Decency is out-
raged at all times of the day by these people, and on Sun-
day some of the men are to be seen in a state of absolute
nudity waiting for the only clothes they have to dry, and
the rakers’ wives and children think nothing of it. There’
are 40 humpies now there, and a large number close by.
Nearly the whole of the people in these shanties live on
the spoil of the tip. Every day cartloads of waste paper
come from the newspaper offices in the city. . . . There
are from 30 to 40 men always waiting for these loads, and
sometimes there is a fight over them. They rush for the
paper, and carry it away over the hill. Both printed and
plain paper is taken, and is-straightened out, and if any
of it is crumpled they lie upon it for a bed to flatten it
out. This paper is sold to the butchers and small shops,
and I know three men who make over 30s. a week each
out of the waste paper. It is dumped down out of the
carts on to the most filthy rubbish, often on to dead ani-
mals and condemned fish. Yet it is taken up and sold to
wrap food up in.
Query : Is there any other allegedly civilised oity
on earth where the corporation issues licenses to. a
race of human beings (the kind who go naked in
public on Sundays) to live and bring up their
families on a public garbage-heap ? Some mem-
bers of the Sydney Corporation talk vaguely about
burning down the filthy premises which seem to
serve as a nidus for the plague. Under all the
circumstances, who can doubt it would be a good
thing to burn Sydney Town Hall—and with it the
persons responsible for the continuance of the un-
speakable, revolting system above-described —the
people who, among other horrors, allow milking
cows to chew discarded hospital-poultices ?

Some More “ Age " Logic.
Melbourne Age still rises every now and then to
point out that the Boer republics should be wiped
off the face of the earth because they don’t keep
their books properly, or something. Some items
from that painfully weak organ’s latest (10th
March): —
But the budgets of this crafty people have evidently
for years been constructed, like their entrenchments, to
conceal the strength they have been accumulating for
the execution of the conspiracy that has now come to
light. In 1880, the last year of British administration, the
whole cost of the Transvaal public service was £153,000.
Since the proclamation of the Witwaterarand gold-field in .
1886, over thirty millions of money has passed through
the hands of Kruger and his satellites, and the published
accounts shed very little light on the destination of these
enormous funds. Obviously, a large proportion has been
utilised in preparing for war on England, in fortifica-
tions and munitions, and in enlisting mercenaries. But
in the last session of the Volksraad the whole sum openly
voted for the “War Department” amounted only to
£265,297, and of this more than one-fourth was ear-
marked for salaries of the “ War Office Staff,” which may
be assumechto consist of the French, Prussian, Austrian,
and Dutch gentlemen who have directed the recent
operations, and the German and Scandinavian hirelings
who have been placed in the forefront of the hottest
battles. Indeed, the total charged to the Transvaal VVar
Department in the last ten years is less than a million and
a-half. In the same period five millions appears under
the head of “ public works,” and as most of these have
really been paid for by foreign loans, possibly the con-
struction of the forts at Johannesburg and Pretoria is
concealed under this heading.
This is very, very sad, no doubt. Yet the
Transvaal is twice the size of Victoria. It
has nearly 800,000 people (including niggers)
against Victoria’s nearly 1,200,000. And in
13 years Kruger and his satellites handled
£30,000,000 of revenue and £2,500,000 of loans,
while in Victoria Gillies and Turner and their
satellites, with less than half as big a country to
govern, and with no native disturbances to swal-
low up the money, handled fully £55,000,000 (this
is not reckoning railway receipts which were
another £35,000,000) and about £20,000,000 of
loan moneys. Victoria has practically nothing to
show for that £55,000,000 ; its public works were
built out of borrowed money, and its roads and
bridges were maintained out of local rates, and
even the interest on its debt was largely
paid out of railway revenue not included in
the £55,000,000. Also, all the expenses of
working the railways were paid out of railway
receipts. It just fooled the £55,000,000 away
on salaries, pensions, expenses, corruption, &c.,
so by the Age’s logic it is quite obvious that a
lot of it must have been spent in treasonable pre-
parations against England. But the Age never
dreams of pointing out these things, though the
fact that the Transvaal fooled away about half the
amount of revenue and one-eighth as much bor-
rowed money as Victoria did shows it to be a sink
of corruption and a place that has been plotting
treason for years, &c. Seeing that the Transvaal
only borrowed at the rate of less than £200,000 a
year, the chances are that a great part of its re-
venue did go in public works. Even a very poor
kind of country can get through a lot more than
£200,000 a year in public works.

A Westralian “ Member.”
A curious appeal signed by “A Member of the
Parliament of West Australia” was lately printed
in the Sydney dailies. The member in question
wants to see Westralia enter the Commonwealth
as an original State, and on this point every true
Federalist agrees with him most cordially. He
also remarks that, after all, Westralia’s demand to
be allowed to retain its separate tariff against the
other provinces for five years after entering the
Federation is a very small thing indeed, and here,
also, every true Federalist will agree with him.
But then the member breaks out wildly after this
fashion :
I think I am j ustified in saying that no sufficient reason
has been shown for refusing to grant to ; West Australia
this small alteration in a clause specially inserted in the
Bill for her benefit and to meet her exceptional circum- '
stances. It may, however, be thought by some that the
possibility of having to wait for Freetrade into West
Australia two years and a-half longer than is provided in
the Bill by clause 95 (five years’ sliding scale being equal
to two years and a-half fixed tariff) is a sufficient reason
for spoiling the Federation by leaving out of it one-third
of the Australian Continent.
Surely if this should be so, the people of Eastern Aus-
tralia, who have had for some years past a trade with
West Australia of over two millions a year, and also have
had immense remittances through the post-office to sup-
port in Eastern Australia the wives and families of per-
sons earning it in West Australia, might well be satisfied
with the certain prospects of Freetrade even two years
and a-half later than is provided in the Bill, especially
bearing in mind that, if West Australia does not join the
Federation, the barrier of customs duties may exist for
years, and may even be perpetual.
Also after this fashion :
Who, may I ask, are the real Federalists ?—those who
require this slight amendment for a brief period of 2£
years more than provided in the Bill, or those who refuse
to make any effort to complete Australian Federation ?
If it was desired to amend the Commonwealth Bill in
any fundamental principle, or if it was intended to alter
the permanent structure of the Bill in any way at all, it
might have been expected that some serious objection
would be taken ; but when the amendment only affects a
temporary clause, which only has force for five years, and
when it is of very little importance to the eastern colonies,
but most important to this colony, one is lost in amazement
at the action of those who, having been foremost in
advocating the Federation doctrine, now refuse to consider
the just requirements of Western Australia.
Amidst the mass of controversy which has taken place
in regard to the attitude adopted by the Government and
Parliament of Western Australia towards this great
question, it has, no doubt, been difficult for a just opinion
of the real facts to be formed by those whose residence
outside the colony has precluded them from ascer-
taining the truth of the matter. I have, there-
fore, thought it right to place the true facts
before the people of Australia, jn order that they
may judge as to whether there is any thing anti-Federal or
unreasonable in the position that has been assumed by
Western Australia, and also in order that if Australian
Federation is nob completed at the present time by reason
of the exclusion of Western Australia, the responsibility
may not be placed on Sir John Forrest’s Government, as
they are willing, if the one amendment above referred to
is conceded, to do all in their power to facilitate and
assist the entrance of Western Australia into the Federa-
tion as an original State.
And Sydney Telegraph, which is always openly
or covertly against the Federal party, promptly
rose in a leading article to say that the above mass
of impudent misrepresentation was most reason-
able and that the concession demanded by
Westralia “might readily be conceded by the
other colonies.” But the responsibility doesn’t lie
with the other provinces. It is practically certain
that they would joyfully and unanimously grant
the tariff concession if Westralia would state
its willingness to come in on these terms.
But Westralia has never offered to come
in if it is allowed to retain its separate
tariff in full for five years or any other period.
Westralia, through the mouth of John Forrest
and with the apparent assent of its nine silent
representatives, asked for and obtained special
terms at the Federal Convention. Forrest de-
clared that it was satisfied with the terms offered,
and the nine silent ones apparently concurred.
After that Forrest demanded that Westralia
should be allowed to retain its separate tariff in
full for a term of years, and also that it should have
a transcontinental railway and some other things.
But Forrest’s Assembly didn’t demand these con-
cessions or say Westralia would come in if it got
them; it merely voted for referring the question
to the people. The Council didn’t demand them
or say Westralia would come in if it got them ; it
threw the proposal to refer them to the people
contemptuously downstairs, and refused even to
negotiate with the eastern states on the terms of
the proposed concessions. The people didn’t
demand them or say Westralia would come in if it
got them; they weren’t consulted. And when
the Council had thrown the matter out and
refused to have anything to do with the suggested
amendments, Bigjohn didn’t call a new
session immediately with a view to giving
Parliament another opportunity of saying that
Westralia would come in if it got the terms in
question; he contentedly closed the Legislature
for such a long period that there was no chance to
get anything done in time for W.A. to be an
original state. John himself says, that if the
tariff concession is granted W.A. will come
in—at least, it is said that he says so,
but even that isn’t quite certain. And he
said the same last year about another tariff
concession, and his word is of just as litttle value
now as it was then. In fact it is of less value
now, for this time John says that certain amend-
ments will make W.A. perfectly satisfied —and his
own Leg. Council has just booted the amendments
out and refused even to give him authority to
negotiate with them as a basis. The Westralian
“member” who reproaches the eastern states for
not granting what the W.A. Houses and the W.A.
people have neither asked nor approved is
a remarkable individual. And the Syd-
ney Telegraph, which wonders why the
eastern provinces don’t accept the terms that
haven’t been offered is quite as remarkable. If
Bigjohn will get his Parliament to say that it will
join the Commonwealth provided W.A. is allowed
to retain its full tariff for five years, or any other
moderate period, or provided it gets any other
reasonable concessions, there will almost certainly
be no difficulty. But if Bigjohn has no control
over his own Parliament, the other States can’t
club that body into sweet reasonableness.

“ By God’s help and the bravery of your Majesty’s
soldiers I have taken possession of Bloemfontein.”— -(Lord
Roberts.)
“ Steyn, Joubert, myself, and the burghers are united.
God will help us.”—-(President Kruger.)
The Australian magistrate has a pathetic faith in
the efficacy of that intangible thing called
“recognisances.” If he had his way he would put
up recognisances all along the coast instead of
fortifications to keep out Russians and other evil-
disposed persons. In Melbourne lately a man
battered his wife dreadfully with an axe-handle
and being dragged before the majesty of the beaks
they told him that he had come near to murdering
the unfortunate woman and that the case was a
serious one. Then they didn’t commit him for
trial and put him in a fair way to get the three
years he deserved; they didn’t even give him
seven days or fine him 2s. 6d. They let him off
altogether so far as concerned the past horrible
brutality, but required him to enter mto his own
recognisances in the sum of £5O not to do it again.
As it didn’t cost anything, he entered into his
recognisances as cheerfully as he would have en-
tered a public-house. Then he went home, and
not only beat his wife in a fearful manner, but
jumped on her as well. He also fought desper-
ately with the arresting constable. He wasn’t
fined or sent to gaol this time either. He didn’t
even get the usual month for trying to damage the
constable, which an ordinary drunk gets—the fact
that he had jumped on his wife was evidently a
mitigating circumstance which compensated to
some extent for the other thing. And though he
had been bound over in some useless sub-
stance to the extent of £5O not to beat
his wife, the £5O wasn’t forfeited, nor any
part of it. He was merely required to
enter into another recognisance of £5O and to find
two other people’s recognisances for £25 each. As
it happened, he couldn’t find the two sureties, so
he had to go to gaol. But he went there, not for
twice almost murdering his wife —he didn’t get a
shadow of punishment for that —but for want of
more recognisances. If he had been able to find
them he could have gone home and once more
kicked his wife within an inch of the cemetery,
and presumably nothing would have happened to
either himself or his sureties, except a demand for
a third batch of recognisances. The law’s faith in
the benefits to be derived by having lots of recog-
nisances about the house is pathetic.

Much pressure is being brought on the Maoriland
Government to “ deal generously ” with the Mid-
land Railway Co.’s debenture-holders—in other
words, to pay the liabilities of that busted concern
in whole or in part. For two years, in fact, the
London financial press has said off-and-on that the
M.L. Govt., will be a disreputable thief if it doesn’t
pay. Which is very like the London financial
press. Ihe Midland Co. possessed certain pro-
perties—its railway, so far as the same was con-
structed, which wasn’t far, and its land-grant—
provided it fulfilled certain conditions. The
conditions were that, within a certain time
it completed and worked the line. If it
didn t fulfil these conditions, its properties—
the line and the balance of the land-grant
tlie State. The co. raised about
£850,000 on the security of “its ” property, but it
tooled away the money in all manner of absurd
ways, and didn t fulfil the needful conditions—in
fact, it stopped work altogether. For its own
capital and the £850,000 borrowed, and the
land it received from the State, it never had
more than £050,000 worth of railway to show.
I hen, after much patience, the M.lj. Govern-
ie line, as bailiff in possession,
and forfeited the balance of the land-grant because
the co. had done nothing to earn it, and the de-
benture-lioklers’ lien on the co.’s property became
of little account, for the co. had very little pro-
perty left. The co. swindled its debenture-holders
u not protecting their interests, and it doesn’t
show the least sign of putting up a penny of its
own money to make good their loss, but it is
very emphatic in its decision that the Maoriland
Government will be a shocking thief if it doesn’t
pay the debenture - holders. There are about
79 miles of Midland Railway open, and
for the financial year to March, ’99, it
yielded £4 profit over and above mere working ex-
penses, so if the Government we e to pay the de-
benture-holders £lOO,OOO out of their £850,000 it
would have rather less than one penny per cent, on
its money. A good many papers, notably the
Age, hold that the Government should be “gener-
ous ” and not “exact its full pound of flesh.” But
why shouldn’t the Government get the same
weight in flesh as a private individual ? Isn’t
there a law against short weight ?

Listen to the wail of the alien-coddling journals
in the North.. Townsville Bulletin : “In North
Queensland, where the disease (bubonic plague)
may now any day appear, it is assuredly incum-
bent on the local authorities to carefully watch
those neighborhoods where Asiatics and Polyne-
sians congregate. We stand in greater danger
from the bubonic plague here than do other por-
tions of Australia, because of the larger
proportion of these races in our population.”
Mackay Chbonicle : “Provision must be
made to localise the Kanakas in our midst
by retaining them on the plantations where
they work and forbidding movement there-
from without passes. Furthermore, strict rules
in regard to bathing on the part of Polynesians
should be enforced,” &c., &c. Poor, poor Mon-
grelia ! It has filled its country with the scum of
Asia; it has imported the leper from Hong-kong
and cherished the poor tuberculous heathen from
the New Hebrides; it has taken to its odoriferous
bosom the Javan, the Filipino and the Jap—and
now it wants to set matters right by washing its
kanaka ! Wash ’em ? Yes, by all means 1

The case of those members of the Jewish faith
who pray for the relaxation of N.S.W. Early
Closing Act on account of their having to
close on Saturdays for religious duties merits
the consideration of men who legislate to
keep Sunday, their own day for religious
duties, a close day. Either the religion of every
considerable section of the community should be
taken into account when industrial legislation is
under consideration, or the religion of no section
should be consulted. If Jews are not allowed to
open on Sunday, and must for conscience sake
close on Saturday, and if they have for the rest of
the week to live within the letter of the Act, there
will be a community of a short week in industrial
competition with a community of a long week.
In some Gentile prisons Jews are not worked on
Saturdays, but instead must work on Sundays.
That was the law throughout Westralia in its
convict days, and fair play demands that if legis-
lation is to keep an eye on the Gentile’s sacred
day it should not wholly ignore the Jew’s.

“ Speculator ” points out something
N.S.W. Full Court the other day came to a decision
which upsets some widely-held ideas about the relations
between mine-owners and miners under the existing
Regulations, and also crashes, into the report of the Royal
Commissioner (Judge Murray) who, a couple of years
ago, was appointed to specially overhaul the code. Justice
Stephen awarded a battered miner £250 damages, and the
co., confident in half-a-dozen former decisions, appealed.
Two grounds were taken—(l) that the Act was against
Common law (which was promptly ruled out as being so
much the worse for the Common law); (2) that Regula-
tion 8, which dealt with the matter, was bad (and so at
least three District Court judges had held it). Regulation 8
says, among other things, that it is the owners’ duty to keep
the workings safe ; and the Full Court decided that much
of it was good in law, even though some of the rest of it was
bad, and the good part was enough for the battered
miner’s purpose. Therefore, when something falls on a
miner now which wouldn’t have fallen if proper care had
been taken, and if the man who gets underneath has been
reasonably careful himself, the owner may as well write a
cheque to cover the damage, and look pleasant. Up to
date he has escaped by shoving the blame on to a negli-
gent workman, and occasionally on to a much over-bur-
dened Providence ; but the Full Court’s ukase is that
when the law says that the owner must see to the safety
of his mine, it means just what it says, without any
special quittances at all.

“W.F.H.” on the Victorian railway-deadhead
plague:—
Dead-heading on Victorian railways has long since
swelled into open robbery of the people, and whilst plain
paying John Smitii laboriously hauls his own luggage
about and has to be content in a stuffy, smellful dog-box,
the dude armed with a free pass commands official atten-
tion and is obsequiously directed into a first-class carriage
which he can generally . have entirely to his own cheek.
Also every member of any Vic, Cabinet is presented with
a free pass over the railways for life, though he may have
held office for but ten minutes or so. There are scores of
members of dead-and-gone governments who still merrily
traverse the province gratis and have the privilege further
of roaming N.S. Wales and Queensland on the same terms
and thedead-heads from those two provinces claim recipro-
cal treatment. Victorian industries for years past have had
to make up £lOOO a day in the shape of Railway deficit, a
big percentage of which was simply handed as a donation
to men who were lucky enough to be included in some
bygone ephemeral Ministry. It will take a cleverly drawn
measure and a resolute attitude of the country to stop
even for a single session any addition to the fraudulent
dead-head list. Ministers who have done substantial
service stand in quite a different category, but there is a
class of schemers who spend most of their time trying to
wriggle into cabinets and by them the province is grossly
defrauded.

A Victorian parson married his deceased wife’s
sister, and has been ordered to get out by good
Bishop Goe for his infraction of the canonical law
forbidding such marriages. The clergyman sub-
mitted, but had he stood upon his rights Dr. Goe
would have been compelled to knuckle down or
chasten his man with another club. There may
be canonical laws in Victoria, but they are of no
more consequence than the laws of the playground
re “buttons,” “alleys,” and “stag-knife,” and
cannot be enforced worth a cent. The clergyman
was legally authorised to marry his late wife’s rela-
tive, and it is a pity he did not stand to his guns,
and defy the canons, just to let it be seen that the
Church of England has no laws of its own out here
There’s One above, the Lord of War,
Who judgeth all things right ;
He sees the Briton and the Boer
Engaged in gory fight;
He takes the souls of them who’ve died,
He hears their women’s sobs.
Now, is the Lord on Kruger’s side,
Or is He helping “ Bobs” ?
Say, is the Lord on Kruger’s side,
Or is He helping “ Bobs ” ?
His gracious aid both parties claim
When slaughtering the foe,
And win, or lose, they praise His name
From whom all blessings flow,
Whilst with a pride unsanctified
The Jingo bosom throbs —
The Lord may be on Kruger’s side,
But Boodle’s backing “Bobs” —
The Lord may be on Kbuger’s side,
But Boodle’s backing “ Bobs.”

Williamson’s new show at Her Majesty’s
is a good way ahead in some respects- of William-
son’s other show at Sydney Royal. “Youth”
may not be quite as good a play as the “Jewess ”
inasmuch as the former is plain undisguised melo-
drama, while the latter is a sombre nondescript
raven of a play with its hair down and both its
bare arms flapping in the air. But “Youth ”is a
great effort in the way of stage-craft, and an im-
mensely strong company has been scattered upon
it Cecil Ward, who is an artist of no mean
order, is put on to be a convict mixing some
mortar in Act V. and to be shot in Act VI
OHy Deering is merely a casual convict who gives
a wild-beast howl, and pounds a warder, and then
vanishes. He is just about as temporary as a dog
running across the street once in a century, yet
peering is also an actor of some standing Miss
Julia Merton is employed for five minutes to hug a
short man with an Irish accent. Arthur Lissant
pervades the stage for about 15 minutes in all.
Cyril Keightley and Harry Hill.do practically
nothing except state that the signature on the bill

Wallace Brownlow appears in half an act only,
i he principals include Kingston as the hero, Haw-
trey, -Tyrone Power as the worst bad man, Lauri,
Miss Pose JyLusgrove, who looks lovely in the
uniform of a very small captain, Edith Crane,
Emilie Hughes and Linda Raymond. It is a
great and lavish cast to spend on a respectable,
*l? „ more than respectable, melodrama.
Youth was never played so gorgeously, or
staged more gorgeously, before in Australia—nor,
probably, in any other place.
Also, b y
way of doing
something ex -
tra, the drama
has been
“ brought up to
date ” by Ber-
nard Espinasse.
The Bulletin
fully expects
shortly to see
Genesis brought
up to date, and
to find it ex-
plained that
Oom Cain was
a Boer who de-
ceived Abel
with a white
flag, and then
hit him unlaw-
fully with an
explosive club
from a kopje
while he was in
hospital. The
final war-scene
is laid in Kim-
berley in 1900,
and there are
Australian
troops inside,
which is an out-
rage on history,
seeing the Aus-
tralians weren’t
there. Wallace
Brow n 1 o w
sings, in a voice
which is quite
the voice of the
old Brownlow,
two rather dis-
mal patriotic
songs. The
wicked majah,
for no visible
reason or cash
motive, is in
league with the
Boers. And
finally there is a
deafening at-
tack by Dop-
pers and other
bigoted Protes-
tants, and the proceedings end with much glory.
Mr. Espinasse has done his share of the work well,
and his ending is more picturesque than the old
one, but the revised version excites less interest
than might be expected. Since Roberts rushed
Bloemfontein, the relief of Kimberley is already
getting into the background. And to bring any-
thing really up to date in Sydney now requires a
few plague cases and a view of the Moore Park
tip.
** * *
“Leah,” with her long hair and her
tragedy and her disappointment and her curse,
re-appeared at Sydney Royal on Saturday under
the name of “ The Jewess.” Neither of these is
the original name, but, after all, “Leah” is a
play that does well to go round with an alias. It
is sad and sombre, and it isn’t strong, and
in places it is very dreary. The scene is laid in
Austria some long time ago, in the days of the
Jewish persecutions, when Hebrews were at a
discount and Israel was two a penny. Leah, the
hunted Jewess, who is stoned every time she
appears, has no visible means of support all
through, except when she leans against Joseph,
the young Christian who loves her stiltedly
through his nose. Joseph’s father is against the
match, and scoffs at the idea of any member of
the accursed race being other than base and mer-
cenary. It is agreed that, if the lady can
be persuaded to abandon Joseph for money,
that young man will tear her image from
his heart, which seems a one-sided arrange-
ment, for there are certain reasons why she
should rather get money for sticking to
Joseph, and it would be a fair thing if Leah paid
the father something on condition he took Joseph
back. The old man’s offer to let her off Joseph
gratis appears liberal. Anyhow, the minion re-
turns and states that Leah has taken the money
and gone, and though Leah is obviously and visi-
bly crying for mercy at the back-gate, Joseph in-
sists on regarding her as gone. In fact, while she
is there he comes out and reproaches her bitterly
for going away. Then he marries the other girl,
and Lean curses him in a fearful manner on his
wedding-day. And here a curious weakness mani-
fests itself, for nothing comes of the curse—abso-
lutely nothing. The awful anathema doesn’t even
make Joseph’s chookey-hen less liberal in the way
of eggs than the chookey-hen of any other person
who hasn’t been cursed. Joseph prospers, and so
do his wife and child, and Joseph’s'old man gets
on well, and Leah’s tremendous swear is of no
more account than a bottle of soda-water. She
makes one more appearance years afterwards, and
forgives Joseph, and takes away the useless objur-
gation. And then Leah, who came from no-
where, goes back there again.
Miss Nance O’Neil is a fine, tall, stately
Leah, but she doesn’t look distinctively beautiful
in the present instance. A good deal of her art
consists in a fierce, embittered canter across the
stage, and she overstrains the part in some
places. On Saturday when she did the three
great amens that end the futile curse, the second
amen was done on as high a note as even her
grand voice could safely reach, and she broke all
to shivers on the third one. Yet she lias a great
voice and a fine stage presence, and she does
the unsatisfactory Leah well enough. It is a
fierce scrappy character of the hair-tearing descrip-
tion at the best, and there are few serious possi-

bilities in it except the old muzzle-loading curse
which doesn’t shoot, and Miss O’Neil’s curse is
good on the whole. Leah only makes a few
appearances, and most of the time small ordinary
people occupy the stage and talk about her.
Clay Clement’s Joseph is stilted and nasal,
but M‘Kee Rankin, Barton Hill and George
Becks all do respectable service, and George
Majeroni gives a fine little study of old blind
Abraham. Also, the subdued, gentle, good, con-
ventional girl of the story—the one that Joseph
marries when his stormy Jewess has done her last
thunderclap and fled over the horizon with the
shreds of tempest trailing behind her—is very
prettily rendered by Miss Inez Bensusan. It is
impossible to put much power into peaceful little
Anna, but she is the sort of girl every man ought
to marry. The tragic heroine, with her hair down
and both hands up, as Leah’s are, would be an un-
comfortable daily shriek to have about the house.
“ Peg Woffington,” due this Saturday, will
be Miss O’Neil’s first Australian appearance in
comedy.

A small child named Miss May Hickman
gave a lecture at the School of Arts, the other
day, on the world-old Development of Woman
question. She is a varied-voiced Madonna-faced
girl with ankles, and she said her little lesson
about the Patriarchal and Matriarchal systems
and the Factory Act very creditably, though it
gave a vague impression as if Fanny Powers, of
the Criterion, were to give a speech on geo-
logy. The number of elderly ladies who took
pencil notes of May’s words of wisdom, and the
number of bald-headed gents who applauded the
small child’s determination not to destroy the
sanctity of the home, was great. A large class of
elderly gent, is generally engaged nowadays in
applauding the sanctity of the home except when
he is as busily engaged bursting up said sanctity
by various methods. May’s conclusions seem to
be that girls should go into factories and at the
same time stay at home, and that they ought to be
good and unselfish, and likewise that they should
do what they choose and assert their own indivi-
duality. The tragic note was struck when the
young lecturess touched on the women who are
compelled to go through life unmarried. Still
there is time to spare, and little May Hickman
may be May Hook-man yet.

Bill Holloway’s relation (strange to think
how utterly Billolloway has dropped out of public
recollection) has announced no change at the
Lyceum, so “Defender of the Faith” will pre-
sumably go on to its fourth week with possibly a
fifth week to follow that. In that case, the least-
clothed lunatic will probably wear out and have
to be replaced. The least-clothed lunatic, though
he fills no particular place on the bill, has a very
rough time of it in the halls of Bedlam, and must
be wearing-out rapidly.

Misses Carr-Glynn and Rochester still
make sweet melody at Sydney Criterion, and
Florrie Ranger sings a wild Jingoistic song about
“A Hot Time in the Transvaal.” There are
allusions to the Bush Contingent and the gods love
it. The gods and their tastes are beyond compre-
hension*. Spry and Austin have returned for a
farewell season of three weeks, and their popular-
ity seems even greater than of yore. After their
first encore on Monday night the house rose up
and called for them with all its large and
numerous feet, and the figure of Harry
Rickards stood up in his box, and his arms
waved, and his hands clawed the air, and he
nearly tore his collar trying to make his voice
heard above the din. He was shouting something
like “ Come on ! —why don’t you come on ? ” But
they never saw him and never came. When Harry
gets excited he is picturesque. Ludwig Amann
gives a representation of old ’Enry Parkes now,
and the reception it meets with shows that the
dead veteran is still remembered. There are some
war-pictures, but most of them are filmy. Only a
few of them are cinematographe, and many of the
ordinary slides look painfully like fakes—pictures
drawn in Indian ink and then photographed.

As many people as could wedge themselves
into the vastness of Melbourne Alexandra came
along the other night to see an estimable actor
play Shakespeare’s longest-winded character.
Dampier as Hamlet is slow in gait, but bright in
intelligence and keen in his elocution. Any
reasoning animal with time to spare for the con-
sideration of a six-act tragedy can feel all the
better for listening to the Dampierian Dane.
Also it is satisfactory to find that Shakespeare
works a tonic effect on a few members of the
Alexandra co. who are sensible of their obligations
to the author, and try to do their best. In sundry
cases their best is good, whilst their worst seems
not too bad. The simple ability to speak up and
emphasise words correctly counts for virtue where
Shakespeare is concerned, and by the same token,
Mrs. Dampier’s inaudible, apathetic performance
of the Queen amounts to a crime. F. C. Appleton
is another experienced mummer whose observa-
tions often get lost in transit. As for the scare-
crow Osric and two or three supernumerary cour-
tiers, they help to entertain the public by their
unpremeditated incompetence. “Hamlet” will,
presumably, appear again before the season ends,
and improve somewhat when the co. has shaken
down into its new and gaudy costumes. Mean-
while, “ Merchant of Venice ” is to be repeated by
General Desire, a warrior who has seen a lot more
active service than General Roberts.
* * * *
Five performances of “ The Three Muske-
teers ” will come to their fifthly and lastly to-night
(Thursday), at the Aleck aforesaid. Dampier’s
version of the “Musketeers” is a disconnected,
inexplicable affair, with big blobs of broad comedy
on its historic surface. Alfred Rolfe, George
Buller and John Forde give valuable assistance to
the leading man, and Miss Lily Dampier is an im-
pressive Miladi, in a handsome spangled drapery.
But there are many reasons why a large collection
of spectacular characters should not be staged by
Dampier just now. The chief reason is the king,
of France. His Majesty is the same lugubrious’
young man who undertook Osric in “Hamlet,”
and, although he passed for a joke in that case, he
is an awfully serious drawback on the present
occasion. All the other serious drawbacks can
consider themselves silently deplored.

The panto, at Melb. Princess’s has been
reinforced by a number of biograph pictures from
South Africa, well-chosen and very effectively dis-
played on the sheet. The advt. promises a fresh
supply of war-films by every mail, but the first
lot ought to suffice to keep business up to the
mark until the panto, has put in its allotted six
weeks.

Widow O’Brien, together with the Living
Pictures and other irrelevances, will retire from
the Royal programme on Friday night. A recent
extra item in Sheridan’s show is a “lightning
sketcher ” who inscribes furious hieroglyphics
upon thin sheets of paper and makes statements
in writing to the effect that his works of speed
represent Col. Price, Baden-Powell, or anybody
worth mentioning. The knickerbockers and gen-
eral agility of this neat young interloper suggest a
talent for sprint-racing, but up to now he hasn’t
run fast enough to catch a likeness when he
wanted it. On Saturday next (24th) Bridget
Sheridan and Co. will set up “ When the Lamps
are Lighted.”

Charles Seel—from London via Sydney—
is the latest arrival at the Bijou, and first impres-
sions of Seel are distinctly favorable. He has a
telling voice and a quaint style, which make third-
rate songs sound nearly first-rate. All the same,
Davy’s Marionettes can give points to any human
comedian on the Rickards’ bill. The oft-re-
peated knocking-down of a wooden figure with
wooden bricks and things is not humorous in
theory, but in practice it is a fine, wholesome
joke which never grows old.

Westralia is pounding on John Bull’s door and
asking him to hand out another million. The loan is
offered at £93 10s. for every £lOO of stock, and as the
province has to pay £1 ss. per cent, to have the loan un-
derwritten, and there are expenses and stamp duty to the
British Government to be provided for, the probability is
that W.A. will get somewhere between £910,000 and
£920,000 net for its million liability. At this rate it will
be paying something like per cent, for the money, in-
cluding the £BO,OOO or £90,000 of lost principal, and it
would have been just as well to float a £921,000 31
per cent, loan at par. The only visible reason why
this is not done is that by floating a 3 per cent, loan at a
discount instead of a 31 per cent, one at par a consider-
able portion of the interest is added on to the principal of
the debt and left to posterity to pay. The difference is,
roughly speaking, something like this : A3J per cent, loan
of £920,000 sold at par. would cost, in 30 years, £966,000
in interest, and it would have to be all paid out of
revenue. A 3 per cent loan of £1,000,000 which only
realised £920,000 would cost, in 30 years, £980,000, but of
this only £900,000 is called interest and paid out of
revenue, and |the other £BO,OOO is called discount and is
paid out of loan funds. The flotation of 3 per cent, loans
at a discount instead of 3J per cent, loans at par (unless
the discount is made good out of revenue, which it never
is) is pure swindle, and a bankrupt device for
paying part of the interest out of fresh borrowings.
Some day, possibly, the swindle will be carried a little
further by giving a bigger discount and calling the
interest 2 per cent. A 2 per cent, loan of £1,200,000,
which was floated at 176 13s. 4d. per £lOO, would also
yield £920,000. That way, the cost for 30 years would be
£1,000,000, but the amount called interest and charged
to revenue would be only £720,000, and the other £280,000
would be called discount and paid out of loans. There
are great possibilities in this particular swindle, if
judiciously worked.

The balance-sheet of the New York Life Insur-
ance Society for 1899 has many points of interest. The
year’s premium income was £8,670,474 —an increase of
over £1,000,000 as compared with 1898. Income from
interest and rents was £2,102,687. Total income was
£10,775,980, and total assets at the end of the year were
over £48,000,000. The assets increased during the year
by £4,000,000 odd. These are stupendous figures, though
mere stupendousness is no proof of solidity—an elephant
may be in a fearful state of decay while a cat is in perfect
health. But the New York Life is solid as well as large. It
has the advantage of a State audit—an advantage which
no Australian institution possesses ; and the State audi-
tor guarantees that its assets, on a most careful valuation,
are largely in excess of all liabilities. It estimates future
interest-earnings at only 3 per cent, which leaves a very
wide margin for contingencies—the most conservative
Australian offices estimate at 84 per cent. As an
additional guarantee it publishes every year a list of all
its assets in detail and the value put on each, and though
this is very little good in Australia still it is a guarantee
that the co. would be promptly exposed and denounced by
enthusiastic and hostile friends in its own country if the
value put on any of the assets was noticeably extravagant.
Every asset has some one living alongside it who is liable
to take an interest in it and make remarks. The expense
rate is the objectionable feature of the New York Life, as
of many other American offices. It amounts to 20 per
cent, of total income or 25 per cent, on premiums—a very
heavy rate for so large and old-established an office. But
in all other respects the New York Life seems admirably
conducted.

The Wilfley Concentrator, which was lately in-
troduced to Australia by the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., Ltd., is meeting with much success, users describing
it as far and away the best machine of the day, and the
Co. is kept busily engaged in turning out the machines to
keep pace with the orders. The range of adjustment to
suit various classes of ores is such that the machines are
being successfully employed to concentrate op tin, copper,
silver and gold ores, and the machines are now working in
all the colonies. The Central Silver Mine, Broken Hill,
after consideration of all existing plants and careful ex-
periments, have adopted them and are putting them in.*

The Standard co. carries £5OOO to reserve fund this year
and the other £784, added to previous balance of £4915
leaves £5699 at credit of profit and loss. The co. wrote,
off £4OOO for depreciation in ’92, so in nine years it has in-
creased its total assets by £12,032. The total reserves are
now £40,699 (reserve fund, £20,000 ; re-insurance reserve,
£l5 000, and profit balance £5699). The business has in-
creased by about £4OOO as compared with 1898, premiums
being over £84,000. As to the co.’s assets, the usual
blank mystery prevails ; they are simply described as
« Deposits bearing interest, £28,704,” and “ Investments,
£6l 903 ” and whether the investments are mostly land,
bricks and mortar, mortgages, shares (with or without a
heavy call liability), or anything else doesn’t appear. The
Standard is a painfully reticent concern, and is most
particular in withholding information that almost every
other co. gives as a matter of course. At the same
time the management shows signs of improvement
in other directions. Considering that, in ’95,’97, and’9B
the Standard paid dividends that weren’t earned, the
resolve not to get back to the old 10 per cent, at the first
gleam of returning prosperity, but to strengthen the
reserves instead, is an unexpected example of plain horse-
sense. Despite the good year just closed the Standard is
£3446 poorer than it was at the end of 1894, so there is a
good deal of leeway to make up even now.

The Metropolitan Mutual Permanent Building
and Investment Association (Sydney) still goes to lee-
ward, though not so fast as formerly, and the manage-
ment has hopes that the dry-rot may be presently arrested.
Recent losses have been:
1895 Loss .. £3659 1898 Loss .. £2387
1896 „ .. 4543 1899 „ .. 1816
1897 „ -. 2945
The affair with the long name has used up all its reserve
fund, and has now £4190 of accumulated losses. Still,
the paid-up capital is £143,310, so (on paper) £139,120 of
this capital is intact. The co. owes £134,286 on mort-
gages, etc., a large part of it at 3 per cent., the interest
having been reduced from 5 per cent, in 97. And the
trouble is that property to the alleged extent of £273,000
doesn’t earn enough to pay interest on £134,000 liabilities.
The properties, in fact, only earned last year about £2 6s.
per cent, on their alleged value, so it seems probable that
the real value of the assets at present isn’t more than
£l6o,ooo—say enough to pay outside liabilities and leave
£26,000 for shareholders. The co.’s income, in 1895, was
£11,629 (equal to £3 14s. per cent, on the paper value of
the assets) ; it was £6708 in 1897 ; £5525 in 1898 ; and
£6438 in 1899. Things have apparently begun to improve,
but a very great deal more improvement is required be-
fore the Metropolitan Mutual is likely to be a dividend-
paying institution again.

The Industrial and Provident Permanent Benefit
Building and Investment Society is one of the few Sydney
building societies which have kept above water through
good and bad times. At the same time, it begins to lie
doubtful if it doesn’t try to keep its head rather too high
above water. The last three years’ earnings have been :
t, Dividend on Paid-un
Profit Shares.
1897 .. £5148 .. £5519
1898 .. 3457 .. .. 4248
1899 .. 3627 .. .. 3857
The Industrial and Provident, &c., &c., is a remarkably
sound institution in every way. It has a paid-up capital
Of £64,200, a reserve of £4OOO, and £3374 of accumulated
profits, and its total liabilities to depositors and other out-
side creditors are £6849. A Concern which has thus
practically no outside liabilities is safe from all risk of
suspension and reconstruction, and the earnings are high.
All the same the balance at Credit of profit and loss has
gone down in three years, through excessive dividend-
paying, from £4766 to £3374, which isn’t so good as it
ought to be. Uni' l s there is a further improvement in
the earnings the div. must needs be reduced before very
long.

Broken Hill Water Supply Co. has not lost all
hope of quitting its works to B.H. municipal council or
the Govt. ; or at least A. E. Olarke, who has the business
in hand, hasn’t. But the shareholders’ £350,000 is not
mentioned now—not even the £300,000 which the council
offered and the shareholders rejected. The drop is
mainly the result of the B.H. Prop.’s declaration that it
is tired of paying the water co.’s high price, and is going
to bring in water from some other catchment. The
Water Co. improved its position a good deal by showing
that it had not, as general-manager Delprat stated, put
up the price of mine water ; whereupon people began to
suspect there was more bluff about the mining co.’s move
than at first met the eye. Still the council will not, as at
present constituted, pay £300,000, or within a good deal
of that sum ; it argues that it made the co. a handsome
offer, that the co. didn’t accept it (in spite of the direc-
tors’ advice), and that now it need have no compunction
about asking Govt, to take over the works on six
months’ notice—which Government has the statutory
power to do on paying a fair valuation with-
out regard for past or prospective profits. And as
the works cost no more than £200,000, and have depre-
ciated heavily meanwhile—well, the amazing folly of the
co. in rejecting the offer formerly made becomes more
astounding than ever.
* * * *
Meantime, whether the B.H. Proprietary means
business or not with its water scheme, it has got hold of
a good site, whose only disadvantage is its distance from
the mines—close upon 20 miles, calling for perhaps two
pumping stations. Surveys are being made, and prepara-
tions go on as though business were seriously meant.
The proposal is to dam the Umberumberka Creek, which,
if it isn’t quite so big as Stephen’s Creek (where the
Water Co.’s works are), is certainly in flood oftener. That
is to say, the Umberumberka is a stream for three days a
year ; Stephen’s Creek for two days at most. Down to
date the B.H. Prop, is alone in the* business, though the
Sulphide Corporation will come in, and others are very
sympathetic.

Mayor M‘Eacharn, of Melbourne, goes in bald-
headed for the Socialistic proposal that the municipalities
should unite and buy out Melb. Gas Co. According to
the special Act, they have power to purchase at a price
equal to 18 years’ divs., based on the average of the last
preceding three years. The Gas Co. paid 20J per cent,
div. in ’9l, but in ’97, ’9B and ’99, only 8 per cent, was de-
clared, so the municipalities can buy now for less than
half of what it would have cost them nine years ago. The
suggestion to purchase was* first made by an obscure
suburban councillor, named Smith, who knew his subject
and took his points well; but now, with M’Eacharn at its
head, the movement stands a strong chance of success.
With the improvement of times there is a prospect of a
bigger profit, and as the co.’s 5 per cent, debentures fall
due, the municipalities will substitute others at 3£ per
cent., thus making money both ways.

In a recent issue The Bulletin was moved to
publish this conundrum :
“ Alfred, Benjamin, and Charles, with their wives,
Dinah, Eliza, and Fanny, go to a fair to buy hogs. Each
pays as many shillings per hog as he or she buys hogs.
Each man expends £3 3s. more than his wife—Alfred buys
eleven more hogs than Eliza, and Benjamin buys twenty-
three more than Dinah. What was the name of each
man’s wife ? ”
At time of writing, correct answers have dropped in from
Ralph P. Tate, of Brisbane ; from “ W.H.S.” ; and from
“ A Tent Dweller.” Result as follows :

Tin fell £ll per ton within the weejf—from £l5l
to £l4o—and copper three months forward is £3 a ton
lower than “spot”—a most unusual thing. No reason

ing balance. Why so wonderful a change in the
management of this mine ? Is it because they have seen
the error of their ways in the past and are now bent on
doing the right thing, or is it on account of the rich chute
giving out and all depending on the lower-grade ore sur-
rounding it ? The market has leaned to the latter con-
clusion : shares fell 25 per cent, within 24 hours of the
announcement.

while the Broken Hill co.’s were tearing out their easily-
smelted ores and selling them to the people who would
give the speediest returns, tires of running its plants

They are all getting down to the sulphides—Mt.
Margaret field, not yet even connected with civilisation
by rail, has sent away its first parcel. And the worst of
it is that, as Callahan, late of L.V. Consols, says, the treat-
ment of these sulphides is so far merely experimental.
Also, there is word from the Boulder that hands are being
shortened in that group of mines “ owing to the delay in
delivering sulphide plants ’’—for which delay at least one
co., having had time for reflection, is itself responsible,
though, of course, the contracting workshop has to take
the blame.

at £5. Darlington Simpson has begun to say big things
of the Horseshoe Peak and Lake Way mines in the same
district. Shareholders were told that Schlapp had
described the former property as a gold-bearing area
covering 7 miles. Well, suppose he did—that is a state-
ment which might mean much or nothing, and in the ab-
sence of Schlapp’s report on the Peak Hill mine itself
shareholders would be wise in refusing to listen to any-
thing coming from Schlapp second-hand through Mr.
Darlington Simpson.

Great Boulder. —Sydney D.T. and Melb. Age
—also other reciprocal papers: “The latest ‘bear’story
is that copper has been discovered in the ore from the
deep levels. The fact is, not a trace of copper has ever
been found in any part of the mine, but the ‘ wreckers ’
are ready with any lie that will serve their purpose.”
Well, copper wouldn’t be a bad thing to come into the
mine, provided the gold did not go out. This is all
rumor ; the important fact is that no div. has been
announced this month, and no reason given for its
absence. Also, it is well-known that the oxidised ore is
rapidly exhausting. Nevertheless, in the great share
slump, the Boulder has held its own remarkably well.
The Kalgurli started running its own plant last
week, and, as usual, big things are expected therefrom.
Shares have steadily fallen the last three months. Treated
to date only 1300 tons, which gave an average of over soz.
to the ton, and of this the newspapers, as usual, make a
great deal. It has no significance whatever. The first
13,000 tons treated on the Great Boulder maintained
more than double the present average. The same more
recently with the Golden Horseshoe, and before that with
the Associated and all the other producing mines of the
field. Averages always come down when tonnage goes up.
*. * * *
Associated Gold Mines. Feb. production, 5137
tons, 37360 z than last month, and last month was
much lower than the previous one. What possible excuse
can be given for the fact that the gold-value for Feb. is
under £15,000 while the working expenses are over
£20,000 ! Truly a nice condition for a mine to be in that
still has a market-value of 2-J millions ! Four months ago
it stood in the market at 6J millions. What its real value
is less than another four months will probably tell ;
shares would probably be more than £1 lower but for the
number over-sold. Another circular has been issued with
the object of re-assuring shareholders. It deals with
the examination made lastyear by M. Ledoux on behalf of
some foreign shareholders and his independent and un-
biassed character is fully set out. He estimated the total
oxidised ores at 115,492 tons, containing 99,9000z5. gold ;
sulphides 611,000 tons containing 969,0000z5. gold ;
grand total, 726,492 tons, 1,068,900 ozs. gold. And in this
estimate, it is claimed, no account is taken of the ore dis-
closed at the 550 in Judd’s shaft which has a width of 50ft.
and assays 2oz. per ton, nor of the ore disclosed at the
250 ft. where the lode is 14ft. wide and assays 18dwt. per
ton. But between the estimated and the actual there
is a gulf fixed which even human credulity won’t
always bridge and it evidently hasn’t done so this time.
Other efforts in other directions have been equally
futile. The moment the collapse came Chairman Landau,
accompanied by a mining expert, a professor, a metal-
lurgist, private secretary, and several other things, left
London for the mine, and has since talked a great deal of
what the future is going to do. Indicates that there is
nothing wrong with the mine ; there never is. The man-
agement has been very bad —that, too, is very usual.
What is wanted is better management, better treatment
of the ore, better work under and above ground, and all
will come out right. But the almost universal rule is
that the trouble is all on account of the mine itself. A
mine as rich as the circular indicates would stand a
heap of mismanagement The frozen truth is that the
wonderfully rich ore chutes are becoming rapidly ex-
hausted and that the little that is left in one of them is
dangerously near the Perseverance boundary. The aver-
age ore outside is not nearly as good as the public have
been led to believe. The mine has so been worked to
drag out the heavy yields demanded by the Board and
hungry boomsters as to leave it in a condition needing
time and work to put it in shape. The market talks :
Since the issue of the circular and the visit of the Chair-
man shares have continued to fall. The Associated has
been worked for several months at a loss and more
months must lapse before it can be worked at a profit.

Westralia has had its first copper-smelter in
blast; when last heard of it had been blown out again.
It is at Murrin Murrin, which is in the potted-dog dis-
tricts out from Menzies. For coke a sort of charcoal has
been improvised locally ; but the results set the owners
wondering whether imported stuff (£lO a ton landed)
wouldn’t be cheaper. The men work two shifts —one at
the smelter, the other praying that the ’Murkan copper
trust will keep its end up. And in the circs, this latter
seems the plucky people’s best prop ; but it is doubtful
whether it isn’t only a reed.

Another Westralian co. which has tied a wet
towel round its head while it thinks hard about its
refractory sulphides is the Woodley’s Reward. The co.
has had Dr. Earp experimenting for six months, but
nothing positive has resulted. Ordinary cyaniding is a
failure with this ore on account of the admixture of cop-
per with it.
* * • *
Be current pars, anent the failure of Associated
and other Boulder (W.A.) sulphide plants. The truth is
(writes a Bulletin correspondent) that the Associated
plant and treatment is a decided success. (Some others
are not.) This from a gold-saving point of view alone, as
costs are known only to mine managers and metallur-
gists. Success is mainly due to metallurgist Grayson,
who has just left to take charge of Broken Hill Block 10.
Details are, of course, kept dark, though it is promised
when chairman of directors Landau (at present on the
mine) gets 'Ome full returns of mining, treatment, and
other costs will be issuedmonthly. Meantime, thisprobably
comes near: Mining, 7s. 6d. ; milling, Bs. ; roasting, 65.;
cyaniding, 6s.—total, £1 7s. 6d. per ton, with manage-
ment expenses to be added. And for results, tailings
average (up to date) under 2dwt., while solution after
passing through zinc boxes contains from 6 to 18grs.
showing a better precipitation than is generally obtained
from oxidised ores.

The Empress, late Lady Brassey, late Canaan,
late several other things which is at Mt. Magnet,
has just crushed 35 tons for 98oz. So far every
new owner has had one good crushing, and has then been
frozen out. But the very latest owners reckon upon
having got a permanent reef at last' —and the Magnet dis-
trict is badly in need of a find or two of that sort.

The “Diehl” sulphide treatment—stampers,
amalgamation, concentration, and smelting of concen-
trates —which is being boomed for quite all it is worth in
connection with Lake View Consols may succeed with
purely sulphide ores. Yet it was long ago experi-
mented with by other mines on those fields and discarded.
Tellurides, or'sulpbo-telluride mixtures, still need roast-
ing—as in Associated or other treatments —or smelting.
Said experiments proved that telluride cannot be concen-
trated, 50 per cent, and over going away, like float gold,
into the slime-pits. Yet, from the “bull” stories going
round the papers, one would imagine a small millennium
had arrived with the “ Diehl process.” How much care
will the Lake Y.O. management take, not to treat tellu-
ride ore with it ? \

A valuable discovery of stream tin containing
coarse gold is now being worked in the vicinity of
Croydon. ' '
Croydon Mining News correspondent wiring
on March Ist from Coen gives particulars of a new rush at
Yodda Valiev in Cape York Peninsula, about 25 miles
south of Coeii. The new field has been named after “ Dr.
Jack ” Hamilton, member for Cook, and at date there
were nearly 300 diggers on the ground. Want of water
seriously affected prospecting, but men were getting
good results per dolly. Prospects were considered good,
but a rush was deprecated until after rain falls. The new
rush can be reached via Cooktown, via the Laura, or by
cutter from Cooktown to Port Stewart, and thence to
Coen.

Mt. Garnet Freehold (N.Q.) : The manager has
reduced his estimate of ore in sight from 200,000 to
198,000 tons, although the mine has had the benefit of six
months’ development since the first was made.. The dis-
crepancy is well accounted for, and the report is very
complete. Average of ore-results, over 7 per cent, copper
and 19ozs. of silver per ton. Two smelters erecting, and
expected to be running, next July. Ore from the mine is
somewhat basic in character, but silicious flux is avail-
able near by, and 2000 tons of charcoal are being pre-
pared for smelting purposes.

On Gordon Creek goldfield, Q., there are still
some 100 miners, who are said to knock out about loz.
per week. According to an expert, reporting on behalf
of a Sydney syndicate, the prospectors’ claim has since
Jan., ’9B, yielded 4580 z., most of which brought £4 Is. 9d.
per oz. The 109 ) tons of stone now ready for crushing
will, it is averred, go 4to soz. per ton. The difficulty in
getting machinery to the field is, however, very great.

Of Horn Island —within a mile or two of Thurs-
day Island —miners returning from the show say it isn’t
wliat they expected to find it, and the share-market indi-
cates that they are right. A year ago it was declared to
be an enormous quartz lode, which would mill lOdwts. to
the ton, and a 40-head battery was sent up. The co. is
not absolutely bombarding the original owners with the
money due to the latter. Formation is a sort of pebbly
conglomerate, worth from 4 to sdwts. per ton ; gold only
worth £2 14s. per oz. “ Distance lends,” &c.
* • * *
Unless The Bulletin is cruelly misinformed
Woodlark Island stock isn’t likely to skyrocket. It is
stated that to get the 70 tons first intended to be sent
across the mine people had to handle 690 tons of stuff.
The result of the treatment of the 16 tons for which a
certificate was received on Saturday-week was a cruel
disappointment to those in the know. The previous
averages were confidently predicted, viz., 7 to Boz. per
ton, but the actual yield was—first, 8 tons, loz. ldwt. per
ton ; second, 8 tons, 19dwt.
The mining madness in Southern M.L. is most
pronounced just now, the dredging- boom, not yet at its
highest, engendering wild speculation. Money is being
thrown into all sorts of dubious shows—salted holes and
other pickled matter. Many rank failures in business and
other circles (including a refuse-collector and an erstwhile
midnight saveloy-man) now own palatial offices, hang out
their brokers’ shingles, and seem to be doing well in the
flinty city of many Scots. Some shares have touched Sss.,
although there’s no dredge on the ground, and no imme-
diate likelihood of one. The provisional prospectus of a
new show was advertised t’other day, and lists had to be
closed next morning, all available shares having been
largely over-subscribed. The winter will see a greater-
boom on both the West Coast and the Molyneux, where
there are some rich claims.

The Vic. Government has settled the cyanide :
patent trouble by buying the patent-rights for £20,000.
The history 'of the M’Arthur-Forrest co. is the storv of
the boy and the nuts over again. It is very doubtful
whether the co. wasn’t really entitled to all it claimed ;
but, rich and powerful as it was, it over-reached itself by
claiming too big a rate of royalty, and inciting the gold-
producing industry to fight it. Had it held out for, say,
2J per cent, or less, instead of 5 per cent, or more, it
would probably have been able to levy on gold-production
right throughout the world for many a long day. But,
instead of that, it elected to fight the Great Pie-biter who,
whenever he reaches out for a pie, ultimately gets that
pie. All the same, the co. has done very well indeed.

SOCIETY
The talk about Sydney City Council mak-
ing strenuous efforts to suppress the plague is
absurd (writes a ratepayer to The Bulletin).
Over 700 men have been appointed as house-to-
house inspectors. Bach was a nominee of one or
more aldermen. The men know absolutely noth-
ing of even the rudiments of sanitation, and carry
out their duties much after the fashion of an elec-
tioneering canvasser on regular pay. A little drop
of disinfectant in the sink, a hurried visit to the
out-offices, and off they go. Six of these gentle-
men were suspended for intoxication, but they
were all re-instated by the “ controlling inflooence
of aldermen.” Patronage, patronage, patronage :
votes, votes, votes—the same old squalid, sordid,
filthy, miserable municipal story.

About 15 months ago a doctor from India
arrived in Melbourne, bringing with him some
gelatine in which bubonic germs were cultured.
The fact leaked out, and, alarmed at the prospect
of the introduction of the plague, Customs Com-'
missioner Best sought the confidence of Health-
officer Gresswell, who regarded the introduction
of the germs as a great danger. The Customs
people found that plague bacilli ware not dutiable,
but the gelatine was, and as the doctor had smug-
gled it in the article could be confiscated.
Accordingly Detective Christie proceeded in
quest of the doctor, and seized and burnt the

PATER : “ Can’t understand it at all; that wine seems to have gone to my head."
H OPEFUL: "Well, there’s 'nothing there for it to hurt, is there, pa? ”
gelatine and its plague culture. Said the medico,
“ You will want these cultures for serum.” His
words were true, for Yictoria wants plague serum
badly and cannot get it.

Bubonic plague was not discovered in
Bombay until after some thousands had been
either cremated, buried, or offered to the birds of
carrion on the Towers of Silence of the Parsees.
A Hindu bacteriologist, a scientist who sat at the
feet of the great Pasteur and Koch, was the first
to find out what the plague was. His reward has
been a high position in the Govt. Laboratory at
Bombay.
In view of the advent of the plague, Mr.
Nicholas Lockyer, N.S.W. Collector of Customs,
has given his subordinates the privilege of smok-
ing m the office. Whereat the latter playfully
remark that anyone named Nick always feels at
home amid smoke.

A correspondent of a Sydney daily pertin-
ently comments on the fact that, whereas the big
ocean liners start punctually to advertised time,
the coasting steamers leaving Darling Harbor are
generally several hours (sometimes as many as
eight) behind time —thus giving intending passen-
gers increased facilities for contracting the
plague through detention in such an atmos-
phere of dead-rat and general stink.
* * * *
“ An Old Mali" writes :
The alleged and subsequently-denied occurrence of a
case of plague in one of the N.S.W. Govt, asylums points
to a danger of the gravest kind. All the institutions are
crowded to their utmost capacity, and beyond it. Men
and women who have had small doles of 3s. 6d. to ss. a
week to help them keep body and soul together outside
have had the allowances stopped, and been given the
alternative of “ asylum or nothing.” Many have
chosen “nothing” rather than enter the asylums,
thus effecting an apparent economy; but many more
have had to go into “ the house,” where their
keep costs from 10s. to 12s. 6d. a week, enormously
increasing the charitable expenditure and crowding the
building where every available foot of floor-space is
occupied by beds ! All this is done for no better reason
than that the most influential of the permanent officials
are firmly resolved to have nothing to do with old-age
pensions, which they regard as a device of the Devil.
They are ready to squander any amount of public money
and to light-heartedly run the awful risk of a deadly
epidemic in their overcrowded rookeries rather than try
the simple, easy, cheap, and safe expedient of an old-age
pension experiment, for which they have the machinery
ready to their hand.

South Australian women, it was lately re-
marked, had begun to kick against all the honor.
and the kharki going to their husbands and other
male persons having no more votes than them-
selves ; and it needed only the announcement that
a few hundred Boer women were at work in the
trenches to decide quite a number of female Crow-
eaters that duty called them out, too. Of course
the usual stupid man-thing had to have his say ;
he asked lovely woman to think of herself crawl-
ing along on her stomach for a few hundred yards,
and to imagine the feel of her back-hair after it
had been a trifle discolored by the blood and brains
of a patriotess shelled alongside her a week before.
The most crushing reply to this jibe was in verse :
Poor old girl ! A lot of ’em when they feel like
that drink dissolved match-heads, and so make
themselves ill. The new patriot simply writes
“ poetry,” and so makes other people ill.
IF!
MRS. FLINT : “My goodness gracious , if you wuz

MR. SQUIRT: “Dead easy — hie; if you war my

The very latest, from Adelaide Adver-
tiser :
V OUNG Man (26), with considerable military experi-
ence, and 12 months active service in South
Africa, wishes to meet some kind patriotic gentleman
who will assist him to support his wife and child
during his absence with Bushmen’s Contingent.
Apply “ Patriotic,” this office.
Minus the “encumbrance,” this scheme might
work. It may work even now. Some nice bald-
headed old gentleman may stretch a point for the
sake of “TheEmpiah.”

Australia is threatened with an awful epi-
demic of military similes in all sorts of peaceful
discussions. At the A.N.A. Conference (Geelong)
delegate Callaghan opened a brisk fire upon the
proposal that five years’ residence in Australia
should qualify British-borners for admittance into
the A.N.A., and that the title of the Association
should be altered accordingly. Callaghan, with
one eye fixed on General Itoberts’ tactics, “ re-
garded the motion as a cleverly-devised scheme
for robbing the Asso. of its national character. . . .
The first sub-clause of the motion represented the
frontal attack, with a cleverly-conceived outflank-
ing provision in the second sub-clause to support
it.” A number of other delegates then galloped to
Callaghan’s assistance, and the crafty motion was
driven off the kopje.
* * * *
The big Australian dailies, which never
lost an opportunity of “throwing off ” at the lI.S.
press during the Spankee war, now labor painfully
in their attempts to imitate the despised ’Murkan
papers. The cable page of the Australian morning
journal is now illustrated as often as not, but how
sorry a figure does the erstwhile decent-looking
Melb. or Sydney daily cut when compared with
the artistic work of San Erancisco Call,
Chronicle or Examiner, papers which cater for
a smaller white population, and which have more
competition ! The Australian newspapers, in
waking up to the fact that illustrations must come,
try to concede to respectability by making their
pictures as hideous as possible.

If all these miserable little pretexts and
devices are necessary in order to raise enough
money to succor the English-speaking sufferers by
this holy war, then this nation is in a bad way.
Here, for instance, in democratic Broken Hill is
Abdul Wade, of the unspeakable Bourke (Afghan)
Carrying Co., receiving public thanks “for ex-
hibiting a two-humped camel for the Empire
Fund.” The patriot who needs a look at a
foreigner’s dromedary before he parts his thri-
pence ought to shout “Rule Britannia ! ”

A certain man was “ wanted ” in Maori-
land for maintenance, but the police couldn’t find
him until his name and address appeared in full
on the list of Is. subscribers to the Christchurch
Press “ More Men Fund.” The next subscriber
on the list happened to be a member of the
“foorce,” and now that other “loyalist” has
become a pronounced pro-Boer.

“King Dick” is in high favor just now
with the school-children (i.e., future electors) of
M.L. When news of Cronje’s surrender came
along, he requested all schools to be closed for the
day. When Ladysmith was relieved, he ordered
a half-holiday. Parents will be glad when the war
is over and there are no more victories to celebrate
But they are afraid to object, lest some “loyal”
neighbor should accuse them of Boer sympathies !

_ There is a man with the first Yic. con-
tingent in S’Africa whom it will pay to get shot.
The firm by whom he was employed waxed so
joyous at his selection that it offered to pay his
wife half his salary during his absence. Accord-
ingly, at the end of the month she attended at the
office and was handed a cheque for £5. The lady
didn’t seem quite certain about the correctness of
the amount and the manager remarked “That’s
right, isn’t it ? £5 is half your husband’s month’s
salary.” A light dawned upon the lady. “ Why,
for years,” she said, “ he’s only given me £8 every
month. Gawd ’elp ’im when he comes back ! ”
* * * *
At a recent thanksgiving-service at Red-
fern, Sydney, Pastor Boyce (of teetotal fame) said
that the early British reverses in South Africa
were due to the fact that “ God was waiting to be
inquired-of,” and that the subsequent change in
the aspect of affairs was the direct result of the
formal national supplication offered up on Feb. 11.
Yet the Boers are still praying as hard as when—
presumably owing to their supplications—they
were having the best of the scrimmage. Accord-
ing to Boyce and the rest, it would appear that—
other things being equal (in the way of hard
beseeching)—the Lord gives Bull the preference
over Boer. Which—no doubt again according to
Boyce and Co. —shows the Lord’s good taste.

Melbourne is a rather well-fortified place
in a small way—a small Australian way, that is.
There are seven forts at the Heads requiring
about 880 men and officers to work the guns, and
the whole Yic. artillery is just about sufficient to
man these forts. If nobody was killed, and the
men at the guns didn’t require any sleep, the forts
could be effectively manned, in case of a real
attack, provided the men arrived in time. There
are also forts and batteries at the other ports, but
it they are all manned Melbourne’s forts must be
deserted, and if Melbourne’s forts are manned the
other places must be deserted. It is alleged that,
for want of men, some of the forts aren’t even
watched at night to prevent the small boy putting
mud into the artillery.

The case of the Yic. bushman warrior
called back to please a lady is significant in show-
ing that already militarism has developed the big
head in Yictoria, and is half inclined to flout the
beastly civil powers, dontcherknow. The inability
of the Government to do this or that in the teeth
of military manners and customs is discussed with
as much gravity as if we were centred in some ‘
paltry, hide-bound, brow-beaten German state.

Ex-Bushman Davey, undoubtedly most
unjustly treated, talked of suing the Crown for
damages, but was well advised to keep his
money in his pocket. In ’95 an ex-militia man
named Gillespie sued the Crown for a small sum
due as part compensation for retirement; he had
a clear case, but the Crown put in the plea that
under the Discipline Act, 1890, he had no legal
right to sue and could not recover from the Queen.

On December 4, ’95, Madden, G.J., upheld this
view, following English precedent, and observed
that plaintiff had no legal rights in the Vic. courts
as a soldier; when he enlisted he yielded up, dur-
ing his term of service, all civil rights that were
not expressly given him by statute ; there was no
contract in the matter, the Queen could discharge
him when she thought fit, but he could not sue for
wrongful dismissal or for wages due. And as that
judgment, unjust and unfair though it be, will
probably hold enough water to drown the claims
of a dozen Bushmen, it will be just as well for any
soldier or prospective warrior to make a note of it
before signing any enlistment “ contract.”

The proposed S.A. “Gentlemen's Contin-
gent” bids fair to perish from ridicule. More-
over, many of those who are pulling the prelimi-
nary strings are grocers and drapers’ clerks, and
consequently looked upon as mere plebeians by
the club element. Another terrible difficulty is
that none of the recruits will dream of accepting
anything. lowah than a lieutenant’s commission.
The mere thought that dear Weginald, danger-

Melb. police have received instructions,
presumably from the Chief Secretary’s depart-

ists, ladies’ nurses, etc. When 2000 picked young

has at last awakened to the gravity of the situa-
tion. Its latest step is obviously taken with a view
to making up the recent losses m population.

Judge Gaunt, of Victoria, still pursues
the manufacture of idiots. At March Melb.
Sessions his Honor, as usual, dispensed copious
doses of “solitary.” Twelve months, with four
weeks’ solitary (a week at a time); two years,
with six separate weeks’ solitary; twelve months,
with four weeks’ solitary, to two others; two
years, with six weeks’ bread-and-water to another
—were some of Draco’s prescriptions; and to a
lad of 18, who had previously escaped from the
reformatory, Mr. Gaunt tendered the trifle of a
couple of years’ hard labor, for larceny, with 36
days’ solitary, three days at a time. “Gaunt”
means lean, meagre, and is a distinctly appro-
Eriate name in this case, for the Judge’s particular
rand of wisdom is just about as slender and
emaciated as these prisoners will be at the end of
the sixth week of solitary confinement.

“Zerubbabel Tadger ” : Surely, surely,
this can never be correct, about the N.S.W.
Wesleyans glorying over Gov. Beauchamp’s allow-
ing them to take precedence with the Presby-
terians ! Why, the Wesleyans were in such a
beautifully strong Gospel position. They said,
“We don’t want the highest places. We prefer
that our brethren should take them.” And, more
by token, this is the true attitude of spiritual
power.
An individual of uncertain nation-
ality was before- Wellington (M.L.)
Court lately, charged with assaulting,
it seems, the whole of the Govern-
ment Buildings staff. His defence was
that everyone he encountered had such
“ snobbish vays” that they aggravated
him to violence. “I first seed de mes-
senyer,” he said, “ unt asked to see
Mr. --——, but dis messenyer had such
snobbish vays dat be woot not look at
me for kuarteravanour, unt ven I seed
Mr. ——, also he too had snobbish
vays, for he woot not see me ; so when
I came out I asked de messenyer if
I could see another shentleman, but he
still kep up his snobbish vays, so I
slipped against him unt he fell down,
unt his nose _ bled, for which I am
pleased at de time.”

The champion mean man, who
belongs to a Southern bowling-club,
fot badly taken down the other day.
Ie was introduced on his own club-
ground to a visitor, and for very
shame’s sake had to ask the latter to
take a drink. Then he put sixpence
down on the counter and proceeded
to hope the guest would kindly ex-
cuse him, but he never drank anything
himself; whereupon the visitor said he
would—at the same time picking up
his host’s sixpence with his left hand apd
with the right pouring back into the whisky-
bottle the nip he had just poured out.
One matter about the newest Tichborne
Claimant (lunatic Cresswell), which keeps the
case from progressing much, is that he flatly de-
clines to claim anything. In his more lucid
moments he sticks to the story that he came out
from England with some bullocks in 1854—in
which respect he resembles Orton, who was also a
pursuer of bullocks, though Orton was an ener-
getic sort of man, and much more likely to over-
take the bullock he was after than sleepy Cress-
well. Up to now one set of doctors has found on
Cresswell’s body none of the marks Tichborne is
said to have had, and another set has found most
of them—which opens up a pleasant prospect for
the man who is suspected of being the person who
was seen doing something, and whose identity is
proved by the mosquito-bite on his spine. The
real Roger Tichborne, by the way, is said to have
spoken French with more freedom than English,
and one witness holds that Cresswell is probably
the lost baronet because he took no notice when
addressed in English, but rushed at-him as soon as
spoken to in French.

A pathetic incident occurred in a Sydney
court, the other day, when an ancient lady, who
declared her age to be a century, and possibly
believed it, applied for maintenance against her
lawfully-wedded husband of 50 years’ standing.
WHAT HE THOUGHT.
FOND MOTHER (exhibiting her last baby to curate): “ What do you think of my lovely boy ?”
BACHELOR CURATE (absent-mindedly): “Ah, a boy I Notv, I thought it was a girl; but they are
puzzling — er—at that age!”
After hearing evidence, the magistrate made out
an order for ss. per week, which, considering that
the poor old man is 80 years old, and is only earn-
ing Bs. 6d. per week, seemed excessive. The
magistrate did his best to bring about a recon-
ciliation, but in vain; the injured wife was reso-
lute, and declared that the old man “ran after
other girls ! ” Alas, the average man only values
that which requires a good deal of running after.
If the century-old wife was able to run, the gay
old man would probably gird up his Bs. 6d. and
run after her. It is when woman gets too old to
sprint that man’s affection fadeth like the flower
that used to bloom in the spring.

One of Victoria’s amazing J’s.P. got a
severe shock the other day. He had just handed
out one month’s “hard” to an alleged vagrant,
when the latter placidly and respectfully enquired
if he might say a few words. Expecting a delicate
compliment on his wisdom or a tribute to the
vigilance of the police, the Bench cordially
acquiesced. Thereupon the graceless vag.: “I
can drink whisky, but you can drink me stone
blind; you have more whisky in you now than
ever I had.” “Soilence in the coort!” “Three
days’ extra. Take him away 1”
In bucolic S. Aus., where the war is only
of much account in so far as it sends up the price
of spare horses and oats, the Kipling beggary Is
varied now by a good deal more sensible plea in
aid of “The Burned-out Cocky of the South.”
Said unfortunate has, in some cases, lost through
bush-fires his house and fencing and sheep, repre-
senting the hard-graft of a lifetime. Also, as in-
dicating the coming reaction, the only collection
taken up while the S.A. Bushman paraded before
embarking was in aid of local charities.

“ Melb.” : Last night I went to a limelight
lecture, by a rev. gentleman in a church, the topic
being the South African war. He explained that
he had draped the nude figures of the Zulus in
certain pictures. “ They were not absolutely
without clothing,” said he, “but I have added*
some more.” Accordingly each Zulu wore a square:
black patch, as of court plaster, or a snip off a
funeral-pall. The worthy fellow did not perceive
that in this actually lay the indecency. On the
other hand, a practical man, Pastor George Brown
from New Britain, lecturing herein Wesley Church
with limelight displaying naked nigs a few weeks
ago said : “If any people don’t like the truth
they must go home.” Nobody did.
• * * *
“Melb.” : To-day I saw a mason sculping
a tomb, with the names of both the husbands of a
lady.
The woman who keeps a
diary is generally lost. A man
recently sued in Maoriland for a
divorce. He was constantly away
from home, and the lady said that
she had a strong case, and would
show that no decent jury could
listen to a plaintiff who neglected
his wife as her husband did.
But, alas ! she kept a diary, and
the diary told of a third party,
and their meetings and spoon-
ings, and the third party’s lovely
hair, and gave the exact locality
of the ditch where they sat for
four hours, one evening, hand-
in-hand, and told of the beating
of their hearts while they lin-
gered behind the hedge while
the parson and Respectability
passed within a few inches of
them, and how the parson’s small
boy threw clods at what he
thought was a hare, and how hard
it was to sit still while the clods
bounced off their heads and
shoulders. The husband found
the fatal volume, and put it in
as evidence, and it told so much
that the jury and Judge said they
'equired no further evidence.
This paper only once knew »
case when a diary helped anybody
out of a scrape, though it has
known of many where it did the
other thing. AQ. man given to
Flossies and late hours kept one,
by way of an alibi. When he
had had an unusually wet night
he used to make -an entry :
“Went forth into the fields and wrestled in prayer
till a late hour ; was rewarded with much spiritual
refreshment”; or, “Spent the evening with
Brother Smith debating the hidden meaning of
Romans VIII.; 13.” He used to leave his desk
unlocked so that his wife could get at the incrimi-
nating volume—and she got at it, naturally. She
rather despised her husband as a man with whom
piety was a disease, but for years that diary
covered many iniquities.

Two solicitors appeared before N.S.W.
Banco Court last week charged by a client with
unlawful detention of money and documents.
After charges and replies were heard Chief Justice
Darley announced that the offences were “ not
proved.” Thereupon the solicitors requested his
Honor to forbid the publication of the case in the
newspapers. This his Honor said lie. had no
power to do, but intimated that the newspapers
should not find it necessary to publish the names.
Now, if lawyers are to be screened when the ver-
dict is “not proved,” why should non-lawyers be
left without the cover of a merciful suggestion
from his Honor ? Either all men’s names should
be suppressed in such circumstances or all men’s
names should have the newspaper publicity their
news interest entitles them to.

A feature was made of the talkee at the
Sydney St. Patrick’s day celebration, for the
luncheon and its concomitant lasted five hours !
Some of the speakers, notably G. H. Reid, were
happy in their remarks, but the flatulent Works

occasion, “ The Hay we Celebrate,” in attempting
lofty flights suggested nothing so much as a 22st.

Of anything but cyclopaedic eloquence the O’Sulli-

men tumbled out and smashed down 400 ft. to the

In a recent Melbourne divorce-case it was
set forth that the lodger was co-respondent, as
usual —lodger and co-respondent are almost
synonymous terms—and the respondent was a
lady with an awful temper. She was in the habit
of lecturing her husband to such an extent after
they had gone to bed that he had to get up and
wander round an adjacent paddock to gej; away
from her. While he was prowling round the pad-
dock under the cold stars, and falling over the
stumps, “the alleged misconduct took place.”
The husband and co-respondent were both
butchers. Butchers are mostly large, meaty,
full-blooded men—the kind who seem to co-
respond naturally.
A NEW DIVORCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She long had loved a gay young spark,
But Fate had placed between ’em
Her husband with suspicions dark,
Because —because he’d seen ’em.
The brute refused to seek divorce,
But kept a manner placid ;
She dared not try her last resource
And give him prussic acid.
Week followed miserable week —
Her brain was near derangement;
At last she found (how she did seek !)
A very bright arrangement.
Brown always was a moral dog,
He knew not sin’s attraction ;
In vain you’d read the decalogue
To find her ground of action.
It was not that he came home drunk
Nor that he did chastise her.
He was (so low the wretch had sunk 0
“ A Boer sympathiser ! ”
The Jingo judge stared hard at Brown
Grew furious and ranted ;
Then looked affectionately down—
“ Of course—rule nisi—granted.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 20, 1900.
My Dear Myee,—
Easter coming on, and no definite word of any-
thing up at Government House. The invitations
for the race balls ought to be out next week if they
are coming out at all, but nothing is settled yet.
The fact is the question is under earnest discussion
just now up in Macquarie Street. His Ex. has
cabled to inquire what they’re doing in Lon-
don. If the home authorities are postponing
gaieties on account of the war and mourning
Sydney will have no Y.R. balls at Easter, but will
be treated to something extra-dazzling when the
war is over.
Last year our own Ex. was quite enough for any
Sydney hop. Nobody wanted anyone else. But
that was in the first fine careless rapture of
curiosity. This year balls might feel the absence
of other glittering Governors, and when you come
to think of it, what Governors are there ? Brassey
departed; Lamington lost (“M.A.P.” says he
remains in London ; local cables say he has set sail
for Bananaland); Tennyson not taking any balls
Smith from W.A. too vain-glorious to fill up any-
body else’s Y.R. party. No, there are no Govern-
ors. Moreover and worse there are no men te
speak of.
Potts Point, when alluding to the question of
the V.R. balls, puts it: “ The shopkeepers will
be so disappointed.” Still, when you come to'
think of it, that’s only another way of voicing
Potts Point.
By the way, the following rather touching and
quite true story is not known to everyone yet. lir
the kindness of his heart His Ex. went, the other
day, to see a poor, old sick man, whose grand-
father had cut up in the same regiment with a.
Beauchamp ancestor. The invalid’s clergyman;
accompanied His Ex., and led him up into the
poverty-stricken bedroom, just as they do in half-
penny tracts. Then the clergyman thought it
would be nicer for him to retire, and leave tlm
Gov. and the old son of a gun alone together for a,
little talk. He went into the next room. A low-
voiced conversation went on. Suddenly a great,
noise arose. The cleric tore in, blessing his soul
as he tore. “Come quick,” cried His Ex., look-
ing the picture of youthful anguish. He was
holding up the sick man in his arms, and beseech-
ing somebody to come and do something, for the
excitement of hearing an Earl inquire sympatheti-
cally after his symptoms had made the old man
violently ill. I believe the artist, who wasn’t
there to catch the V.R. expression at that minute,
lost the chance of a lifetime.
The first night of “Youth” had less than the
usual amount of “revival” frocking in the d.c. I
saw Sylvia Grey in the crowd. She was wearing
an exquisite twine-colored real lace frock—the
sort that looks like nothing till you are close up
against it—and a girdle of genuine turquoises.
Her hair is still dressed in a bun at the back, and
crushed down to her head with an all-over fringe
net. She and her husband—the gilded Fenwicke
—a fair man with a fashionable, bored expression
—came out by the India, and are staying in Syd-
ney for a few days before they go to Queensland.
Just behind me sat Kyrle Bellew. How that
man keeps his youth! A beautiful child-like
expression played about his eyes and mouth as he
watched some of the terrors of “Youth” —as put
on the stage. He also came out by the India.
Health and private business brought him along,
but his stay here will be very short, and he is not
going to do any acting. He told a reporter that
people he had never seen before were for ever
stopping him in the Sydney streets and asking—
“ls Mrs. Potter coming ? ” He is rather a testy
Kyrle, and at last his temper edged, and when
anyone said “ Good-day ” to nim he would imme-
diately reply, “ Mrs.-Potter-is-quite-well-thank-
you-she-is-not-coming-to-Australia-at-present-and
she-wished-to-be-remembered-to-every body.”
Kyrle Bellew was once a scribe on Melbourne
Evening Herald, and used to write Police-court
reports in rhyme. As thus —
Mr. B. and Mrs. B. don’t get on well together. The
other night Mrs. B. got tight and he commenced to
leather. Fined five bob or the rising.
Which is the only scrap of Bellewian melody that
my informant, one of the few surviving scribes of
the Kyrle reportorial era, can remember.
I was going to tell you something about the
house that greeted “ Youth,” and that long cast
of favorites, Edith Crane, Kingston, Tyrone
Power, Cecil Ward, Wallace Brownlow. But I—
well, you told me the other day that whenever I
wrote about a fat lady in red satin and turquoises,
I always made her out to be a Jewish lady, which
she —they, rather —are not —I mean never were.
You said, too, that if there were 396 Christians in
black satin in the d.c., I invariably passed them
all over and pointed out what four innocent not-
Christians in nothing particular were dressed in.
Taking these utterly false and unfounded accusa-
tions seriously to heart, I will pass over Satur-
day’s circle, merely mentioning that “The
Jewess ” was the play at the Royal, and that —
but no, I will let the d.c. severely alone.
A frightful amount of smoke and banging makes
this new “Youth” different from the old one.
There’s a rail way-station scene, beautifully staged,
where we see the soldiers going away, and hear
whistles, and watch a handful of redcoats move
out reluctantly. And the play ends with the
“ Relief of Kimberley.” Then the longest piece
of gunning I have ever seen on any stage goes on.
Broken-hearted boys, whose parents wouldn’t sign
consent to Augustus joining, are advised to go and
have a look at this scene. I fancy “ The Relief of
Kimberley ” will be as nothing then to “ The Re-
lief of Augustus.”
Edith is not a success —sartorially or otherwise—
as a Frenchwoman. She ought to be always play-
ing someone with a milky soul. The Adventuress
is a misfit on her Trilby expression. She wears
a cream frock striped with turquoise blue ribbon,
and a cream hat with blue strings and forget-me-
nots on top. Emily Hughes gets in three snappy
frocks. The one I remember best is a soft green
silk polonaise appliqued in darker green, over>
chiffon frills, with deep silk fringe outlying the
polonaise. Rose Musgrove gets into boy’s clothes
again, and suffers from a creased back. There is
evidently a lot of art wanted to make men’s
clothes for women. With a better tailor Rose
would be a better boy; but that is a truism, isn’t
it? Wallace Brownlow comes on late in kharki
and sings “Gunga Din” and “The Absent-
Minded Beggar’s Reply ” as nobody else in Aus-
tralia could sing them.
There was no question of “ Pay, Pay, Pay,” but
the house has grown so used to throwing money
when “Absent-Minded” is mentioned that coin
flew about without invitation. The quality of
Brownlow’s voice is as rich and velvety as ever.
He sang a sovereign right out of a millionaire’s
pocket.
The guests at Sydney Supper Club’s last
foregathering were to have been artists Fullwood
and Fischer, and poet Henry Lawson ; but with
that shrinking modesty characteristic of the
Sydney artistic and literary world, Fullwood and
Lawson were represented by excuses —leaving that
desperate character A. J. Fischer to fill the breach
unsupported. The Supper Club, by the way, is
now Sydney’s only really Bohemian organised
■coterie —the only literary-artistic club in which
qualification is strictly insisted on. Elsewhere, I
am told, “even if you deal in rum and onions ” you
can still be put up as of literary and artistic quali-
fication. “He gets his living out of rum-and-
onions, it is true, but his artistic yearnings are so
intense that one of these days they will cause an
■earthquake in Sussex-street ” —said a scoffer of an
intending candidate for the Art-and-Onions Club
the other day.
The engagement is announced of Miss Jessie
Middleton, the piquant young musician, who has
gained much fame m Sydney as a highly-successful
“Society” teacher, and Dr. Frazer, a brother of
Mrs. C. B. Fairfax. The wedding comes off very
soon, and the happy pair will settle in London.
Under the head of “ Honors for the Australian
Horse ” it is announced in Sydney that—
Second Lieutenant Robertson Clark, Ist Australian
Horse, with the honorary rank of Captain, is to be aide-
de-camp to the Governor, and second Lieutenant Thomas
Leslie Willsallen a honorary aide-de-camp to His Excel-
lency, with the honorary rank of Captain.
What’s the difference? Does it mean that Mr.
Clark is, and Mr. Willsallen is not to get paid for
■dawdling about Guvmentouse? There are also
surmises that the simultaneous gazetting of the
two appointments proves the existence of certain
social jealousies in horse-poet Mackay’s regiment.
May Yohe is often to be seen in town. She is
■dressed very simply—muslin frocks with trains,
and shady hats trimmed with big bows of ribbon.
Seen close, she has a small, attractive face, either
very bright or veiy weary-looking.
But everybody is tired this month. To make
March worse, the air, the cruel, aqueous, treacher-
ous March air, is being made more offensive than
usual by the odours of carbolic acid that haunt
you all over the city. Which reminds me that
some people are getting mixed about those odours.
The other day a landlady disinfected her drains
with carbolic. Next day Bridget de Smith came
upstairs with along, string-colored face. “ Hivins,
the pleg’s here ! The house is cram full of dead
rats! Ow! and the smell of thiin’s awful!”
There hasn’t been a rat seen or heard of in that
establishment yet. But then I suppose lots of
people will always smell a rat when there’s car-
bolic about.
Supposing a nurse catches the plague and dies
while nobly doing her duty to Australia in nursing
plague patients, will the State give her dependants
if she has any, the same pension that it gives to
the dependants of a dead Boer-hunter ? If not,
why not ? The nurse takes six times the risk
of the contingenter and her courage is far more
conspicuous. She goes to meet an enemy which,
so far, has killed six opponents out of seven. The
contingenter goes to confront one who only
manages to kill one opponent in 15 or thereabouts.
I paid a second visit to “ Magda,” and found
the house just as crowded. Nance O’Neil caught
on with her first speech, and everybody is hurry-
ing to hear her. The only change in Magda was
that she had given up those pink flowers in her
hair. A blue chou to match her blue dress re-
placed them. The villain, Mr. Canfield, was still
talking of his “ holy and auspicious resoleution ” ;
Nance was still saying “ Oil ways the same ! ” the
company had got used to pronouncing “Magda”
“ Margdar ” ; and “ Margdar ” was still saying to
Papa “Schwartz: “Then Papa, I will sit right
here at your feet so that I can see your beautiful
white hair.” Papa was bald in front, and all she
could see with the naked eye was naked and shiny
forehead. Did she mean it unkindly ? Some men
are sensitive on this point.
By the way, Col. Schwartz does keep a parlor-
maid in his establishment, for she appears in the
play-bill and also in the first act, but his daughter
Marie scarcely ever enters the room without a
tray of cups in her hands. If she did that after
Magda’s appearance, one might think that the
great lady with a past had monopolised the
only maid, but as Marie appears with the cups in
the beginning, unto the end, we think her an
extremely useful girl about the house, and we
would rather like to be parlor-maid to Colonel S.’s
family.
When Papa Schwartz shows Magda his study
door and marches her in, many of us were carried
back to the days of our youth, and recalled being
shown into a study by just such a Papa. Our
backs tingled a little. However, Papa evidently
did not wnip Magda, for she returned to Polite
Society quite unruffled, bodily, though rather dis-
turbed mentally.
By the way, the men in the Nance O’Neil com-
pany are all remarkable for their avoirdupois,
while the women, Ricca Allen, Edith Berry and
Inez Bensusan —all, excepting the star actress
are featherweights.
At the “Jewess,” on Monday night, the d.c.
was all press and Gentile. I did not see what was
up in the gods, but there was a lot of clapping
whenever the play said “ things ” about Christians.
What a Continental nightmare that play is ! A
well-known bit of nightmare is the scene when
Joseph accuses Leah of being bribed to give him
up, and Leah never once says, ‘‘ I took no bribes, ”
but hangs round his ankles and howls ‘ ‘ Joseph ! ”
at every word he utters. In a nightmare you
never deny the false accusations made against you.
The house sits and aches for Leah to say “It’s a
lie! ” but no, the play is a nightmare, and she
must not, dare not say it.
Nance O’Neil is more often off the stage than
on. She dresses herself in drapes of orange,
purple and dark red, artistically blended. She
wears her own fair hair, hanging loose, and spends
a good deal of her time in pushing it off her brow,
or pulling it on, as the case demands. Her Jewess
is a fair woman, just a shade darker than Nance’s
own blonde coloring. Mr. Clay Clements, other-
wise Joseph, who gets cursed, wears his hair
parted in the middle, and makes faces perpetually.
The always reliable Mrs. Bracy still continues to
look a dear, good soul, even in plaits and peasant’s
costume; Miss Edith Berry comes, and is gone, in
pale blue that suits her well.
Mr. Lister-Lister is holding an exhibition of his
pictures all this week from 10 till 5.
The Society of Artists opens a little show to-
morrow, Wednesday, to the public. Admission
free, catalogues free. And very low prices on the
pictures. They range from one guinea to five —
nothing higher, nothing lower. The show struck
me as small and lively and bright. George Lam-
bert paints a well-known model—commonly
known as Vena —and makes a bold effect
with her dark head and dark violet gown.
The same artist cleverly catches, in oils, on a few
inches of canvas, a realistic red and blue bit of
wharf and ship and crowd called “ Farewell to the
Bushmen.” I liked ever so much “Carmelina,”
by Dattilo-Rubbo, the head of a woman with
bronze skin, fair hair and blue eyes, an orange
scarf thrown over the head, tenderly helping the
bronze of her skin, and a dead-white drape round
her shoulders. The usual quantity of grapes and
dead birds fill up the comers of the show. Pupils
—especially female pupils—come to the fore with
studies of heads and flowers. Isobel Jacobs shows
a study of an extremely pretty girl in a sailor hat.
Julian Ashton, Sid Long, Tom Roberts, can all be
bought for mere nothings and I advise you to
hasten round and buy what you like best.
By the way, why does the wedding-present
keep so persistently to “ Something for the table /”
The gifts—well really, you can hardly call them
that nowadays, seeing that an invitation to a wed-
ding is a cloaked demand for a cruet or an entree
dish —at a recent wedding looked so like a silver-
smith’s-shop that some guests -really didn’t care-ah
to look at them, don’t you know. Pictures are
always desirable, yet how few people think of giv-
ing them ! I think it would be an excellent idea
if the long stream of wedding guests found its way
into some of our artists’ studios, instead of worry-
ing jewellers to know if anybody had sent Miss
Blank fish-knives or butter-dishes.
The wedding of Miss See and Mr. Sam Hordern,
junior, filled the Randwick streets with a huge
crowd last Wednesday. Lord Beauchamp and his
new aide, Mr. Willsallen, came out to the church
and watched the knot-tying, but got home before
the speeches and the cake. The pretty dark bride
wore ivory satin over flounces of Brussels lace and
insertion, and the six pretty bridesmaids made
up a “white wedding” in white crepe de
chine frocks trimmed with tucks and white
silk fringe, white chiffon hats and waist-
belts of white paiine with paste buckles.
Much speechifying and congratulation went on
at “ Urara” after the wedding ceremony, Premier
Lyne, ex-Premier Dibbs and other veteran toasters
making things lively in the marquee. The bride
went away for the honeymoon at Bowral and
Melbourne in a hyacinth-blue voile, white feather
boa and black-and-white hat.
From Paling and Co. I have received, grate-
fully, one piece of music that hasn’t fallen victim
to the patriotic plague ; “Te Salude,” by Milli-
cent Alexander {Millie Davis), a tuneful three-
pages of common time. Paling sends also a
“Rally Round the Flag of England,” dedicated
to the Mayor of Newcastle, a song which shows
all the symptoms of the disease well marked from
the preliminary symptom of “crimson thread”
down to the delirious cry “Old England’s England
still.” I can recommend the song to anyone who
wants a change from “The Absent-Minded
Beggar.” Charles Huenerbein’s “Bushmen to
the Front ” (H. S. Chipman) is also heartily re-
commended for the same reasons.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Victorians feel keenly the loss of the officers
of their first contingent. Now that Capt. Salmon
is dead, only one prominent officer, Colonel Hoad,
is left. The rest are dead, wounded, or missing.
Every fresh loss naturally distresses and excites
Mrs. Hoad, who has had a slight stroke of paraly-
sis in consequence. The genial and manly Col.
Umphelby was one of Victoria’s most accom-
plished rifle-shots and most popular officers. Mrs.
Umphelby is a member of the well-known Austin
family, and her state of health has been such as
to make her very dependent upon her husband’s
companionship, so that her loss is felt to be
peculiarly heavy, and much sympathy is felt for
her. The Colonel was a popular member of the
Yorick Club and he wrote to ‘the boys’ from
the Modder River. He felt and imbued many of
his friends with the idea that he would fall early
in the war.
“When the Vic. Bushmen’s Contingent was
about to embark, Serjeant-Major Algie was told
off to accompany them, at two hours’ notice, and
he got ready in the time, which was reckoned a
good record. But the S.-M. was beaten by his
wife, who, when told the news, didn’t waste time
in vain regrets, but set to work to break up her
home, sell her furniture, pack her boxes, farewell
her friends, get photographed, put her hat on
straight, and get on board the Euryalus—all in
120 minutes. Minister Melville and all the men
of Melbourne are full of admiration at this per-
formance, and want to know why their lady-
friends can’t imitate her style, instead of wasting
an hour or two in dolling up before going down
town for a stroll. All the women are indignant at
the feat, and hint that Minister Melville is a bad
timekeeper, in fact quite incorrect.
“ A certain officer of the Bushmen’s corps told
his fare welling friends at Langwarrin that long
before he had dreamt of dabbling in war’s alarms
a fortune-teller had revealed to him that he would
cross the water and be shot by a man he had never
seen in his life. The gallant officer took so much
credit to himself for being a marked man that
several anxious admirers cried out, ‘Don’t,’ where-
upon he smiled heroically and said in a casual
sort of way, with his chest expanding for the
ball —‘I’ll die when I must.’ It is needless to
add that the interesting fatalist got more lasses
and prayers than all his brothers-in-arms put
together, and there is now some talk of a sub-
scription to pay for the shipment of his cold
remains to Australia when he shall have met his
doom.
“ Rifle clubs are to be epidemic, but who knows
whether the Australian will ever out-Boer _ the
Afrikander in his mastery of the arm in question ?
Some people say our national forte is throwing
by hand, and point to the skill of Australian
bowlers, black boomerangers, and larrikin
‘rockers.’ On holidays, ‘blokes’ and their
‘donahs’ usually wind-up the outing by aiming
things at one another in anger. When ‘ Nosey ’
sees ‘Beller’ perched on ‘ Ginger's ’ knee, comb-
ing the latter’s moustache with her side-comb, he
morosely lurches to the late ‘grubbing ground,’
and stands shying empty bottles at the unheeding
couple. Three-year-old ‘Squinter,’ in short,
washed-out infant’s frock, mannish tweed pants
and red fez cap, takes example, and, as all the
grown-ups are too drunk to notice him, has a gay
time pitching vittles at inoffensive outsiders.
Warming to his work, the innocent, exerting all
his strength, lifts and drops with an awful crash
the bandbox with the company’s few remaining
bottles. The terrible catastrophe sobers all be-
holders, and poor ‘Squinter’ is caught in the
machinery of retribution.
“ Mayor M‘Eacham is terribly disgusted at the
shabbiness of the fashionable people who have
hustled for invitations and enjoyed nis lavish hos-
pitality during the time he has been in office, but
have meanly shuffled out of helping in the fete
organised by him for the benefit of Melbourne
Hospital. He sent out small parcels of six
tickets to those who have most consistently shared
in his entertainments, and some of the wealthiest
of his erstwhile guests have returned them, with re-
grets at their inability to attend. Of course, it is
shabby of them, but it ought not to have taken a
man of M'Eacharn’s shrewdness all this time to
find out that the naicest are the meanest and
most selfish in the community. In this connec-
tion, the fashionable shopkeepers will confiden-
tially tell you most astounding anecdotes.
“ The youngest sister of Lady Hopetoun—Hon.
Maud dq Moleyns, aged 30—is to marry a young
Tory M.P., named Gretton, who sits in the
Commons for South Derbyshire. Gretton is 30
years old, and a director of Bass’s brewery. This
marriage finishes up the bunch of Lady Hopetoun’s
tall, high-stepping sisters. All the rest of the
girls married young; Hopetoun’s wife netted him
when she was but 19.
“Overheard (solemn fact !) in a St. Kjlda
(Melb.) railway-carriage whilst two sumptuously-
dressed ladies—they would be offended if you
called them women were discussing domestic
economies. ‘ She seemed a very nice girl, but
you did not keep her long after all.’ ‘No, in-
deed. The presumption of the creature ! Would
you believe it —she wanted her cold bath every
morning.’
“An ex-Premieress creates harmless diversion
by insisting on her right to first place above the
salt. As the wife of a Privy Councillor, she counts
next to Vice-Royalty itself, and none dare say her
nay.
“Private Davey, about whom there has been
much fuss in Victoria, can appropriately quote
‘ The Absent-Minded Beggar ’ in his own benalf.
Tommy ‘ leaves a lot of little things behind him,’
and the ‘ Hooligan ’ bard (vide Robert Buchanan)
pleads that the public shall provide for the girl.
But the first time a Victorian soldier is accused of
trying to be absent-minded in this fashion the
Government won’t let him go and die for some-
body else’s country. Why have so many
thousands of pounds been raised for the absent-
minded one if it’s so wicked of him to be absent-
minded ?

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Beauchamp is the first bachelor-Governor
N.S.W. has had since the advent of Responsible
Govt She has had widowers, and doesn’t seem
to want either class;, repeated.
A member of N.S.W. Govt, guesses the
anonymous London donor of £lO,OOO to the war-
fund to be no other than Agent-General Salomons
himself, who holds the secret.
It was the late A. G. Taylor, in the Tri-
bune, the Sydney D.T.’s defunct weekly, who de-
clared the Soudan Contingent “had returned to
N.S.W. graced with glory and garnished with a
goat.”
It was'confidently expected in certain
scholastic quarters that the will of the late Sydney
Burdekin would have disclosed a substantial
bequest to Sydney University. Occasional hints
dropped by him gave ground for the expectation.
Mr. Burdcjdn’s mother donated £lOOO to the Uni-
versity.
The accflsed in the big Broken Hill strike-
conspiracy case of ’92 relied largely upon the
evidence of newspaper reporters, of whom they
called three from the city papers—Julian Thomas
(“The Vagabond”), J. F. Edgar and George
Stevens. Not one of the three was an old man ;
yet all are already dead.
Sir Geo. Bowen received the Governorship
of Queensland as a reward for putting into modern
Greek an address of Mr. Gladstone’s. The Grand
Old Man was only familiar with the ancient form
of the language, and when he went to the lonian
Islands the presence of Bowen, who was president
of a college there, was a help to him. An easily-
earned Governorship
Jingoistic as the Lyne Govt, outwardly is
it feels in its heart for a rebel capable of giving a
vote in the Leg. Assembly. Josiah Thomas,
M.L.A., whose Broken Hill utterances were so
seditious during the miners’ strike there that
Premier Bibbs erased his name from the roll of
J’s.P., has just been re-decorated with those
letters by Premier Lyne,
Alderman W. P. Manning, now tripping
to England, is one of the few Australian knights
made in England without being nominated by an
Australian Premier or Governor. Manning’s title
came at the instigation of certain London money
circles whose interests he represents in Sydney,
and Curran, M.P., of the Commons, did the per-
sonal canvass at the Colonial Office.
George Brookman, the S.A. jam-merchant,
who, with his brother, pioneered the famous Asso-
ciated Syndicate, is believed to be really worth
well oyer a million. He is now on the way ’Ome,
and his friends assert that he will come back a
knight in return for his gift (£15,000) to S.A.
School of Mines. Brookman is having a magnifi-
cent mansion, one of the finest in Australia, built
for liim in Adelaide hills.
Included in the S.a. batch of the Bush-
men’s Contingent is Roberts, Labor M.P. and
the youngest S.A. politician. When Gov. Bux-
ton first visited Port Pirie, Roberts’ constituency,
the Labor man was introduced to him on the
train. “ And what js your profession, Mr.
Roberts ' said the pious Governor. “ Wharf-
laborer,” was the reply. Then the conversation
abruptly ceased, and Buxton strode into the next
compartment.
That long-departed humorist, O’Brannigan
of Rye plantation, was one of the old-time identi-
ties of the Mary (Q.) river, and used to
visit Maryborough weekly for the regu-
lation drunk. An old bachelor, with a
long, patriarchal white beard, brick-red
face, regular features, and over 6ft. high,
he made a highly impressive figure. One
of his best jokes was to call in, while
on his way to town, upon a certain blue-
stocking matron, Mrs. (say) De Jonson,
when something like this would occur.
The O’B., after depositing his hugely-
puggareed hat amid great ceremony under
his chair, “Have ye been reading any-
thing lately, Mrs. De Jonson?” She,
effusively, “Oh, yes, dear Mr. O’Branni-
gan, a charming book by Professor Obfus-
cate, ‘ Our Old World’s Youth ! ’—have
you seen it ? ” The O’B., looking vaguely
around him, and twisting his Victor Em-
manuel moustache, till his hostess had
gotten him some whisky, “ Have I seen
the book, is it?'’ (with polite scorn):
“ Have I noticed that you’re looking
younger and younger every day I do be
looking at you!” (Drinks deliberately.)
“I would go one better even than Obfus-
cate, madam. I have not the laste gleam
of limitation in asserting that the pan-
glacial conformation of the siluvial and
diluvial strata, in my very plantation
alone, let me have no other conviction
that its convex sinuosities—thim of the
strata mintioned, av coorse—possiss a
record of, at the very laiste, sivin or eight
billion centuries.” Mrs. De J., evidently
bewildered, but trying to look the other
thing, “Do you really think so, Mr.
O Branmgan ? But do you go with him
m his theory of moon-cycles ? ” The O’B.
(emptying the bottle), “ To some ixtint,
madam, partial—hie—partially, that is to
say. But he overlooks the marvellous
symmetry of lunar concatination strange-
ly, and is quite at. say about stellar anti-
climatic complications in ginral—hie ! ” Then the
rest of the company would have to bolt, and way-
“f ™ O’Brannigan till he remounted outside
Ihdn 11 do it grand, me bhoy ?” he would say.
The published list of persons “ men-
tioned ” for the vacancy on N.S.W. Public
1 ervice Board includes the name of more than one
greasy, tricky pusher whose selection would alike
be a calamity to the service and a disgrace to the
community. Dr. Norton Manning is the right
man for the post, if his services are available. An
experienced, able and humane administrator “a
gentleman right down to the ground,” there is no
one whose appointment would give such confid-
ence to the service.
Little Surgeon Fitzgerald, who has gone
to the war as a consultant, is obviously far from
being in campaign form. He looked very shaky
on the day of the Vic. Bushmen’s embarkation,
and leaned on the arms of two nice girls as he
made his way along Port Melb. pier. “ Fitz’s ”
martial ardor, strange to say, did not lead him to
appear in uniferm ; he boarded the transport in
the grey suit so familiar to racecourse habitues.
Justice Cohen is one of the most improved
and improving law-givers on the Bench—especially
m Chamber matters. To realise it, one must have
seen him in the Dibbs-Byrne prohibition case, last
week. Some villain once told this paper that all
Mr. Cohen was on the bench for was to cohen-cur
and cohen-side with the rest of their Honors ; but
even a casual reference to the law-reports will
prove that the Judge has views of his own.
-Be the N.S. Wales Agent-Generalcy, it
was rumored last week, before the appointment of
Copeland, that the following persons nad had the
refusal of it: Dr. MacLaurin, Speaker Abbott,
ex-Mayor Manning (every one with a title lias
first call), Pilcher, Q.C., John See, G. H. Reid,
Major-General Neild (or is it Field-Marshal?),
Mat ’ Harris, John Norton and “Dick” Sleath.
The story that Colonna-Close had declined the
post is not confirmed.
So far as The Bulletin knows, about
half the members of the various Australian
Ministries, despite their uproarious lip-loyalty,
gave nothing to the Patriotic or Bushmen’s Funds,
and the rest gave very little. What was the
amount of that N.S.W. “sedition-hunting”
Minister’s gorgeous cheque? As for the obtru-
sively-loyal M’s.P. only about one in four seems to
have parted with a copper. And how they talked
about “ making sacrifices for the mother-land !”
The defeat of Purves, Q.C., for the presi-
dency of the Australian Natives Association by a
majority of nearly two to one, was a surprise to
Victoria. The successful candidate was Mayor
Skelton, of Dunolly. Purves has been con-
sistently unlucky in public affairs. He was a
failure in Parliament, and had no sort of show for
the Federal Convention. His manner of addressing
meetings as though they were juries, and his fine
scorn for those who dare to differ from him, cause
resentment.
Admiral Sir Harry Keppel was the officer
whose. Midshipman Easy-like larkiness caused the
tragic estrangement of Hori Grey and his wife.
The three actors in the drama lived within a
stone’s throw of each other for several years before
the death of the Greys. It seemed like an anti-
climax for Hori to admit that he was in the wrong
after the lapse of 30 years. The old salt is much
alive at the age of 90, has published a book of
reminiscences, and considers that he was ill-used by
the great Pro-consul.
Henry Copeland, who has moTe than once
held office in a N.S.W. Ministry, is to be the new
Agent-General for the province. He will well
represent the official N. S. Wales of the hour,
which would appear to have absolutely no Aus-
tralian views or aspirations, but to be wholly and
solely Jingo. Mr. Copeland is a Yorksliireman
by birth -tind the purest of “Tykes.” He is
mulishly obstinate and glories in fight; is abso-
lutely honest and is not known ever to have
turned his back on a friend —or an enemy. He
was for many years a working gold-miner. He
it was who said in N.S.W. Assembly when it was
proposed to send Australian troops to Sout
Africa : “England must blood her pups.”

(Vic.), when
Minister of Mines,
had such confidfence
in scientific opinion as
represented by the pro-
fessional geologist’s re-
i-vi'cs, that he promised on the floor of tlie As-
sembly to eat his hat if anyone ever showed him a
ton of Victorian coal. Many thousands of tons
have since been produced, but the indigestible
meal remains uneaten.
In Charles Dickens’s “ American Notes,"
published about 60 years ago, humorous reference
is made to a fellow-voyager who, having crossed
the Atlantic on three previous occasions, was
looked upon by the other passengers with much
awe as a great nautical authority. That was Lord
Mulgrave, afterwards Marquis of Normanby, and
Governor of three Australasian provinces.
King O’Malley, having moved on from
Crow-land, thus appealed to the Lyell (Tasmania)
electors at the recent general election :
Vote for King O’Malley, who in the Parliament of South
Australia proved the real champion of the worker’s rights
and who believes more in legislation for the advancement
of living men and women than the delusive rights of
pulseless property. Workers, be not deceived by the
tongue of slander in the sugared mouth of hypocrisy
Be not frightened at the awful words, “ Adventurer ” and
“ N< ? stake in the country.” Rather pity the ignorance of
the ignorant Billygoat Brigade that utter them What
constitutes their own stake ? Simply being the
fly-blown outposts of the city banks and wholesale
warehouses to which they are everlastingly staked
Workers, remember that the pioneers of civilisation who
re-lighted the torch of Liberty snatched from the grasp
of hooting, howling savages were all Adventurers. All
the great inventions are the product of the genius of Ad-
venturers. Both polygamy and human slavery were de-
stroyed by Adventurers. All the great men and women
of the world are Adventurers. All the pigmies are not
All the thinkers who have fought to enable the poor to
have better homes, higher wages, better food, better
clothes, and free education have been branded Adven-
turers by the human blood-hounds of oppression and
privilege. Thank God, the time is near at hand when all
those fossiliverous fogies, relics of antiquity, with other
useless things, will be placed in second-hand Coffins
and buried deep m the grave of political oblivion
Workers, be not misled by the unholy alliances which are
being formed to encompass my defeat. My election bv
the Workers of Lyell means the bursting of the Tas-
manian Parliamentary Kruger Ring. It sounds the
death-knell of Pluterdom, Fugeldom, Sweaterdom and
Fossildom. Democrats, vote solidly for the Democratic
King! Do not split the Democratic Vote for the benefit
of stagnant retrogression.
There were four candidates for the solitary Lyell
seat, and O’Malley was a bad second, old member
James Joseph Gaffney being over 300 votes ahead
Charles Gavan Duffy, Vic.’s veteran ex-
Premier, has drawn the last instalment of the
thirty-sixth year of his £lOOO a year pension. He
is at present hale and hearty, and is reckoned good
enough for several thousands more.
Captain Miles has just returned to repre-
sent Hobart in Tasmania’s Assembly after leaving
the House and the Ministry because his fellow-
legislators almost unanimously adopted the report
of a select committee finding him guilty of certain
very steep and awful things. He made about the
worst exit that an Australian Minister has ever
made, yet he hasn’t been out quite six months.
To a great extent Miles got back on the patriotic
racket. In his speeches to the electors he frothed
at the mouth over the “ Empire,” and he struck
the Hobart electors at a time when Jingoism was a
good card to play. The Contingent fever has led
to some strange results, and the whitewashing of
Miles is about the strangest of them.
Gov. Beauchamp isn’t the first seidlitz-
powder man in Australian history. When the
late lamented J. B. Patterson was Victorian Pre-
mier he was greatly pestered by his Castlemaine
constituents, who, naturally, all wanted Govt,
billets. J.B. used to carefully give each appli-
cant a letter of recommendation to some depart-
mental head or other, but the envelopes were
different. Those who bore letters in blue covers
were at once “ chucked ” by the receivers, but the
lucky holders of white envelopes received due con-
sideration, and were put on the list. After a while
the secret leaked out, and every one wanted white
envelopes. Such clamor arose that the system
had to be changed, but Patterson made all smooth
with the voters before next election.
The season for visiting the old country having
come round again, the upper four-hundred of Sydney are
booking passages for London, and as a safeguard are as
usual depositing their plate and other valuables in the
Sydney Safe Deposit. In many cases they are also rent-
ing safes for the storage of their deeds, etc. In either
case the rentals are very moderate, and the business of
the Deposit is, we learn, rapidly increasing. A visit is
freely invited. The address is Ash-street (back of
Paling’s), off George-street.*

Something that happened lately on the
loneliest part of the now drought-closed Milpa-
rinka track, in far-west N.S.W., illustrates the
awful situation in which the bushwoman of the
Never-Never sometimes finds herself. This one,
a widow, was housekeeping for a teamster, when
their hut was burned, and in it her three-year-old
child. In the peculiar position in which she was
placed the poor creature was afraid to bury the
body without informing the police ; but the nearest
police were about 50 miles away, and she had no
means of reaching them. There was no shelter ;
and the temperature in the shade passed 112.
Worse still, the clothing and food had been burned
with the hut. Finally, something had to be done
with the body; so a grave Was dug, and the body
lowered into it. Yet, she was still too terrified to
put earth upon it, so she hid it from herself and
the sun, beneath some bags and boughs. For-
tunately, at this stage, a policeman passed, escort-
ing a prisoner, or there might easily have been
two victims of that bush-tragedy instead of one.

X new sub-protector of aborigines was
lately sent up by the S.A. Govt, into the heart of
the continent, with headquarters at Alice Springs,
vice Gillen, so long stationed there. The new
man, Bradshaw (like Gillen, he is an officer of the
telegraph dept., in charge of that section of the
overland line) has just sent down his first report;
and it is valuable chiefly as showing how local con-
ditions strike a man who hasn’t come to regard them
as right merely because they are of long-standing.
Bradshaw runs full-tilt against a recently-pub-
lished Adelaide statement that “the keeping of
gins for immoral purposes is a rare occurrence.”
The new man says he doesn’t know anything about
the “keeping”; but—“in the native camp near
this station there are 11 half-caste as against nine

black children under (say) five years of age ; and

Eercentage of half-caste children is very much
igher, a black child being a rarity.”

“ Cassander ’’ : Probably the cleverest
axemen alive are the Fijians employed in the Suva
wood-yards. Have watched them split stringy
logs thus : Each takes an end, planting one foot
firmly thereon, and one swings the axe over hard
into the centre, then the other opposite swings his
over into the middle also, but just a half-inch in
front of his mate’s axe-head. This enables the
first axe to be withdrawn leaving the other as
wedge ; with the next stroke from the freed axe, a
smafl straight crack in the log is a certainty.
Then they both stroke along to their ends m
lightning time, keeping a perfect line. As soon
as the round log is split in two the same perform-
ance goes on with the halves. They can split an
awkward knotty stump without wedges which
would quite beat a white man. It is a treat to
see them cutting through the native hard-wood
piles, although latterly they have been using the
crosscut-saw for this kind of work. They are
most accurate with the crosscut, but with a single-
handed saw very crooked. In using adzes they
discard the ordinary handle and substitute a much
longer native one. All their canoes are now cut
out with adzes, also (mum’s the word) a lot of
island curios. The Fijian could never take to
hammer and nails, he fibre-binds everything. He
uses the crowbar for the pick, and a long knife for
the sickle, and would sooner shovel earth into two
buckets than carry it away in a wheelbarrow; but
he mostly prefers looking on at other Polynesians
working, and would get quite ill if he had to labor
more than three days a week. But he can work
hard when he has to dig up yams for a festival.

“ Wonga ” : None of your Aboriginaliars
appear to have referred to the enormous con-
tractile power of snakes. Have caught a 6-foot
carpet snake as it was disappearing in a hole, and
although I am fairly strong I was unable to get a
budge out of him, and had to let go after an ex-
hausting pull. As regards the striking v. biting
question ; hold a brown or black snake with a
forked stick over its neck (or break its back for
choice); then hold something soft near enough
and there will be no doubt that a snake bites. It
is the lightning dart of the head that has origin-
ated the idea of striking. The carpet snake, how-
ever, will sometimes strike (but with mouth closed)
at its assailant. I have seen a small dog disabled
by such a blow. There was no sign of a bite, yet
the dog died in a few days.
Dear Bulletin. — The animal inquired
about by “Xerxes” (B. 24/2/’00) is simply a well-
known bandicoot, which belongs to the family
Peramelidce, and is known under the name of
Peranale lagotis. Fifty years ago, Gould, the
ornithologist, strongly recommended the domesti-
cation of this marsupial in England, considering
it dietetically superior to deer, horses, or rabbits.
Absurd to speak of rabbits and bandicoots “cross-
ing.” Placental and non-placental animals can’t
“cross.” —H. J. M ‘Gooey,
“ San Remo ” :
Be luck of drunks and
children. At Emerald
central railway some
years ago, two navvies
strolled into town
from the next railway
camp one Saturday
afternoon. Both got
very drunk and had
a wild time. About
2 on Monday morning
one rather mixed
navvy poled a trolly
out of the township.
A quarter-mile from
town the railway
crosses the Nogoa
River. The bridge is
about 300yds. long,
and dips sharply at
both ends; the train
has therefore to cross
at full-speed to be able
to climb the steep
gradient. The up-
train and the navvy
met on the bridge in
the dark, and natur-
ally the navvy came
off worst. The driver
described the accident
in a few words. There
was a mighty crash
of shattered trolly, a
slight shock to the
engine, and all was
over. The guard said
he heard the trolly
falling on the rocks
below. When the
train pulled up at the

lifted him down and

“Thargo” : The “bilby,” inquired about
by “Xerxes” (B. 24/2/’00), was known in Cobar
district before rabbits were found wild in Aus-
tralia. The animal is very shy and mostly feeds
at night. It makes large holes in the earth and
connects them with tunnels.
“A. 8.” : The “bilby” is»the smallest.variety
of plains wallaby, lives underground, and never
comes out till after dark. It is about the size of a
guinea pig and, like that animal, exceedingly good
eating. It is thicker through fore than hind
quarter, has short strong legs and a beautiful blue-
grey coat. The tail is rather shorter in proportion
than the wallaby’s, and has the underpart worn
bald with sweeping the soil behind it in burrow-
ing. The creatures are never seen out except
shortly after a dull sundown when there has been
a shower, and then they sit upright in a row on
top of the heap of excavated earth and look like
little cats.

“ Flats are as plentiful as ever in town,”
said old Chirpy, who had just come
back from his yearly spree. “If a
smart chap like me wanted to be a
bit crook, there’s money to be made.
It’s like this : I was in the horse-yards
when a fellow come up. He’d been
out-back. Knew me. Of course
everyone who’s been out-back knows
me. Wanted my opinion of a horse.
Knew me as one of the best judges in
the country, and, of course, that’s no
lie. I didn’t like the horse. He
didn’t buy. We went over to the pub.
and liquored up. A friend of his come
in—real nice fellow. We liquored up
again. Then in comes a half -drunken
swell, apologises and shouts round.
Told us he’d just come from India.
One of them flats —more money than
brain. Money ! I tell you he pulled
out over £lOO and. offered to give a
pound for every pound I could show.
I expect he’d had sunstroke and it
had made him soft. The other chaps
whispered rhe that we might as well
have a cut. I was rnore’n half-in-
clined to do it, but it seemed mean,
so I got the toff away upstairs and
put him to bed till he’d sober up.
Cornin’ away I heard the nice fellow
that was nearly buyin’ the horse
damnin’ somethin’ awful. I expect
he’d got cramp in the stomach. It’s a thing
that often comes on ye sudden like.”
“E.S.S.”: Your far-west correspondent
asks : “If a bushed man mostly travels in a circle
because one leg is a trifle longer or stronger than
the other, how about the circling of bushed
drivers ? ” But —the eyes have more to do with
it than the legs. In 99 men out of 100 the sight
of the two eyes is unequal. The stronger or
keener eye predominates in effect, and a tendency
to diverge from a direct line is the result. As to
circuit-driving at night, the driver can’t see where
he is. Besides, objects haven’t the same appear-
ance at night as in the day-time. Flats, for one
thing, look like gently-rising hills. Also, a horse
can turn clean round in broad day without his
rider knowing it. A horse’s mind is always fixed
upou some particular spot —mostly home, often a
waterhole —and he’ll get there if he can. At
night a horse can distinguish small objects at his
feet while going at a canter when a man can’t'see
his hand before his eyes, and, in such cases, a
driver is apt to sheer off from imaginary impedi-
ments, and thus in time execute a circle. (When
bushed, one should always let the horse have his
head till one reaches water ; or—if in a locality he
knows—let him go his own way.) On Wooroo-
woolgen (N.S.W.), a few years ago, a half-caste
was cantering home on a very dark night when
suddenly the horse bounded high in the air, and
stopped dead short where he landed. Rider dis-
mounted, and, by striking matches, found that a
storm had strewn the road with broken branches.
The horse had jumped with him through the fork
of a fallen tree, and landed with his chest within
a foot of the jagged end of a projecting limb.

legitimate than
the legitimate
son of a “mon-
key.” He had
a powerful ob-
jection to all yel-
low men. Also,
he had a power-
ful objection to
both his parents—the father for being a China-
man, and the mother for marrying one. More-
over, he had so long circulated the report that
he was white, the result of his mother’s immorality
with some white man unknown, that he felt called
on to support the theory by despising her for her
alleged immorality. They were a happy family.

“S.”: The mule is only known to the
majority of Australians by l-epute, and then as a
sort of enlarged and aggravated ass, but my ex-
perience of the animal convinces me that he has
more horse-sense than both his parents. Mules
are used in the Gippsland hills, beyond Bruthen,
for packing, mainly to carry the stone from scat-
tered claims down to the miffs, and these often
develop the facility of a black boy in dodging
work. One veteran in a mixed team at Swift’s
Creek adopted a perfect system whereby he
escaped a great deal of the heat and burden of the
day. At the tip he schemed to be last loaded, and
at the battery hustled to be first relieved of the
pack. One day a big iron tank collapsed, and the
whole string stampeded with their loads. Solo-
mon, the mule; was back inside 3min. The horses
had to be hunted for in the scrub. If the packs
had been off, Solomon would probably have been
missing for a month. When turned out. hobble !

and belled, the crack of a whip drove Solomon
into hiding. He muffled his bell effectually by
pressing it against his breast with his chin (or the
place where his chin would be if a mule had a
chin), and would lie perfectly still under cover
whilst the rounding-up was going on. One Sun-
day afternoon the mule’s owner backed him to
steal the nose-bags from three horses, and he did
it, systematically making the collection before
starting to eat. He was the most uncompromising
Sabbatarian in the district, and neither bribes nor
abuse would induce him to work on the day of

“ W. 8.8.”: Re suicidal tendencies of ants.
While camped in Riverina I once saw about a
dozen meat ants forming a nest close to head of
my bunk, and noticed that one double the size of
any of the others used to come out every now and
then, sometimes carrying a small piece of gravel,
and sometimes apparently for a breath of fresh air.
Took it that he was “running the show” and
doing the quarrying. Killed him at last and took
him away, causing immediately great consterna-
tion among the rest. Excavating operations
promptly ceased and search parties were organised.
I put the corpse beside the entrance to the hole,
and as soon as the others saw it they retired pre-
cipitately into the hole, all except one which
promptly commenced filling in the hole with sand.
When he had completed his task he attached a
small piece of gravel to one of his and
catching same in piece of grass pulled at it until his
leg came off. Repeated the operation with the
other back-leg, and then commenced biting him-
self about the body until he died. [Verily, a tall

had a family of
gilded youths
whose pranks
would have landed

about ten years
hard. On one oc-
casion one of them
rode another
man’s horse up-
stairs into a Tower
Hill hotel, necessi-
tating the demoli-
tion of a side wall
to extricate the
animal. Another
time his brother
carried a dishonor-
able utensil, full
of champagne,
round the lawn at
a local race meet-
ing, and urged
everybody to take
a drink at the
point of a revol-
ver. But their
proudest deed was
ac comp li shed
when returning
from another race
meeting. Thera
was a lodge gatd
at the entrance t
the homestead,
and about 6 p.m.
the boys raced
down the road in
their drag. The
visitors’ party fol-
lowed ten lengths
behind, flogging
hard, and just as
the leading team
approached the
whip yelled out to
the keeper “Shut
that gate F’ The old man knew better than
to disobey, and as the boys tore through
he swung the gate right in the face of the
visitors’ team. The drag was smashed to
smithereens and three horses killed in the wreck.
In later years these youths found an imitator in a
titled Australian, whose last bachelor supper cost
him £l2OO, chiefly for damages. Everything in
the room was smashed, and the piano filled with
fizz.

“H.S.” about edible Australian larvae,
beetles, &c. : ...
Probably the acacia-grub is the best. It is a lustrous
white in color, and about the thickness of an ordinary
fore-finger. It is very good raw, though personally I pre-
fer it roasted, when it is like yolk of egg both in appear-
ance and taste, and also of nut-like flavor. This grub in
fact would be considered a great delicacy if only the
initial repugnance to the idea of grub-eating could be
mastered. The aborigines lay these grubs on the red-hot
ashes, turning them carefully between two long slender
sticks until they become externally brown and crisp and
the juices exude. The viand is placed on a piece of bark
and eaten. In this form it is delicious. All edible grubs,
however, are not so palatable, and I never could manage
the beetle “ Eurynassa” or the Bugong moth. The latter
was at one time a common food of the N.S.W. aboriginals
at certain periods of the year. These moths are found
upon rocks and in the crevices thereof in immense numbers.
After the natives have collected a great quantity, a large
area is cleared and brushed clean ; and a fire is kept going
on it until the ground is of the required heat, then it is
again swept, and the moths placed on the hot bare soil
and moved about occasionally to keep them from burning.
When cooked they are put into bowls of bark and shaken
about from one bowl to another, so that the wind will
clear away the wings and other refuse. The residue is
then kneaded into cakes, which will keep for several days.
The natives eat grubs holus-bolus, but most white men re-
move the head and skin, though others who have lived
far out in a semi-wild state will bolt them as the blacks
do in their entirety. One man I remember in the Terri-
tory (Sam Crocker, a fine bushman, since killed by the
natives) was very fond of grubs, over which he would
smack his lips like a schoolboy over fruit. The Encounter
Bay tribe (S.A.) call the big grubs found in the gum-trees
Woorlabatte, and they use a hooked stick to extract them
from under the bark. A small grub much-sought-after is
the Koop jp; which also favors the gum-tree ; and there
are numerous others, which, though inferior to the acacia-
grub, are considered delicacies by the aborigines.

The Bulletin prints this for what it’s
worth: —
“ A. A.” : Smart as he is, the horse-jobber isn’t “in it ”
with some Arab camel-dealers. A favorite dodge is to
give a lean camel the look of a fat one by inflating him
like a pneumatic tyre. Curious must be the sensations
of the unfortunate’ beast as its dimensions thus slowly
but surely increase, and curious also the sensations of the
purchaser who, having bought yesterday an extremely
well-conditioned camel, finds to-day, in its stead, a miser-
able creature which has leaked down to its original
dimensions. The “ charging ”of the animal is done
through a small slit in the skin behind the ear. From
this orifice the air insinuates itself between the outer and
inner skins and inflates the former, thus forming a sort of
air-cushion over the animal’s body. This is a true bill,

treated in the above manner by an Arab-dealer at the

it had considerably diminished from loss of air.
This seems founded on a physiological impossi-

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended .various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no eason for not now being cured.

“ O.M.Gr.” : For pure gall, you cannot beat the-
trick played on a neighbor of mine by two Melb. loafers,
the other day. It was a very hot day, and Che pair were
stricken with a fearful drought, but had not Che necessary
sixpence for two big drinks. After much cogitation, a,
black conspiracy was hatched. A bag was stolen from:
somewhere, and in a secluded spot one conspirator tied:
the other in it. Then he took the burden on his back,
and marched into the nearest yard and pitched the
housewife a doleful tale. He was a wood-hawker. This was.
his last bag of wood, and so anxious was he to get home
to the bedside of his sick missus, who had eight incurable
diseases, that he’d take 6d. for it, and throw in the bag. The
deal came off ; the master-mind dumped his mate down
in the shed and departed. The man in the bag watched,
his opportunity through a hole and crawled out. Meet-
ing someone in the yard, he asked if they wanted to buy
a 10-guinea Family Bible, and, as they didn’t, he left; and
the two drank joyfully in an adjacent pub. And when
the buyer wanted the police to take the matter up, on.
the ground that she had been induced to buy some wood,
which had afterwards gone away by itself, the Force only
smiled, and said it was doubtless the heat.

“Z.Y.X.”: That “Business, Robbery, &c."'
par. (l's/2/’OO) re the compositors who work 80 hours a.
week for 30s. on country papers is quite possible—in fact,
is more than probable. Was working—or slaving—once:
on a tri-weekly on the N.S.W. Southern line, where ap-
prentices were the vogue, and one young fellow assured
me that though he was two years “ out of his time,” and
wanted to get married, his wages were only 225. 6d. a.
week. He was afraid to ask for a rise of even half-a-
crown because he knew there were other apprentices just
out of their time, and their places would be filled with
more boys. In that office they worked 66 to 70 hours a
week.

Farmers have no unions, and so millers and
wheat-buyers get them by the wool every time. This is.
one way. The farmer goes to the miller ami buys wheat-
sacks for 6d. or 7d. each. He fills them and takes them
back to the miller, who pays for the bag as wheat—that
is, he pays (say) 2s. 6d. a bushel for wheat and weighs the
bag in. Which means that with wheat at that price he:
pays about three half-pence for a bag which only a day or
two before he sold for 7d. ; and then, the bag being still
new (he makes a deduction, in fact, if it isn’t), the miller
puts his brand on it and fills it with his flour. Also, the
miller or buyer who buys in the dry, sapless inlands finds,
that the grain has, after a few days at the moister seaside
or on ship, gained so much in weight that a good deal of
his freight-bill is thus paid for him.

Dear Bulletin. —In issue of 10th March a.
traveller from India, now in Tasmania, is quoted as saying
that he paid 2s. 6d. for a pint of Australian claret, and
could have got better French claret at same price. Will
the traveller from India mention one hotel in Australasia,
where he can get good French claret at the price men-
tioned. I have for years sold all brands of wines, foreign
and native, and have not yet been able to buy wholesale
French clarets at anything like 2s. 6d. the hpint. Per-
haps that traveller correspondent can lay me on to a,
cheap market. In my experience Australian clarets from
good vineyards compare very favorably with French ditto,
and at a much cheaper cost. —Snakejuice.

The old superstition that grapes were necessary
to the manufacture of wine has just about got its death-
blow. American scientists say it isn’t the grape that gives,
the flavor, but the fermentation fungus. Apple-juice, to
which the- vat-fungus obtained from the Xeres district
(Spain) has been added, cannot be distinguished from
sherry. Big. business is done just now in European wine-
districts in obtaining yeast from the vat sediment and
packing same for exportation. The end of it will be.
we’ll all be sucking diluted fungus through a straw.’

Mat Larkin, judging from his examination in
Melb. Insolvency Court, finds no fault with his old Boom-
time morality. He gives sass to the examining counsel,
and treats the gent on the Bench in a friendly sort of way.
Questioned as to certain “borrowers’” accounts in the
South Melb. Building Society books Matthias said he
believed he was the recipient of £3350 in the name of M.
Larkin and Co. The security for that particular loan
realised £6lO, by the way. On the subject of £3398
“loaned” to T. Walsh and Co., the ex-secretary of the
Society was able to speak positively. He—Matthias
Larkin—had been T. Walsh and Co. at the time of that
transaction. When the judge asked him why he didn’t
borrow the money in his own name Matthias replied,
“ To tell you the truth, I did not want to have too many
accounts in my own name on the book.”

“Domino”: When, the other day, a well-
known money-lender sued a victim for £4O in Melb.
County Court, defendant pleaded that, as he had other
creditors, 10s. a month was all he could pay. Merciful
Judge Hamilton made an order accordingly, and as at
this rate it will take nearly seven years to wipe out the
debt the shekel-monger nearly had a fit. Apropos, a few
years back present writer saw in a city emetery, on the
grave of an unscrupulous shent-per-shenter, a huge
flowery I 0 U, which had been surreptitiously deposited
by some of his sorrowing “ clients.” '

The Yic. A.N.A. dropped its usual art-union
out of respect for “ the moral sensibilities of the people,”
and cleared £BO on its annual corroboree. Previously
£lBOO was considered a very poor profit on the event.
Evidently it is the moral sensibilities of the people who
never had anything to do with the A.N.A. carnival and
never want to that have been catered for by the neyv
move. But it is pathetic to learn that the £BO profit this
trip was realised out of bookmakers’ licenses.
A Melbourne man The fact that raffles are
illegal has no apparent effect on their circulation. It is a
growing - custom for people to purchase all manner of
articles, wear them out, and then foist them on to a
guileless public at so much per member, the highest
thrower of the dice to take the alleged property. Bicycles
barely worth a fiver are raffled at the rate of 500 members
at Is., and diseased canaries are worked off in a similar
fashion at ten times the value of a healthy fowl. The
man in business is waited on almost daily by persons who
are getting up raffles for autoharps, ponies, go-carts,
dogs, and other useless properties. The shopman is ex-
pected to contribute his sixpence or shilling to a
“ deserving case ” —a lone widow with 14 starving infants
—“ such a beautiful pin-cushion ; do go in, won’t you ? ”
and he goes in just to get rid of his visitor. At the pre-
sent time writer has his name down on a multitude of
raffle-sheets for articles he doesn’t need, and won’t know
what to do with if he wins ’em—cockatoos, bicycles, a
history of Europe, two lamp-shades, a roll of moth-eaten
cloth, four armchairs, a pair of field-glasses, and a case of
eggs. Last week he won two canaries, one of which
was blind and died next day, while the other will shortly
expire from senility. He has also just learned that he
wasn’t the winner in a raffle of 500 members for two
sheets, a pillow-case, and a nightcap all complete.

SKETCH AT QUEEN'S STATUE (SYDNEY).
Even the unemployed rally round the Queen!
The Victorian Courts still make a pretence of
believing that Joseph Gray, the long-disappeared Gee-
long solicitor, with the shortage of some £200,000 or so.
is still around and may be expected to drop in casually at
any moment. When his bankruptcy case came on, the
■trustee asked for 12 months in which to trace the assets,
■and seeing that no one has any distinct idea where to
look for the assets the idea was probably reasonable.
But the Court was shocked because insolvent Grey
wasn’t there with the assets in his pocket to
save all this trouble. It didn’t know officially
that Gray had been for a long time the most
completely missing man in Victoria, and in the absence
•of affidavits to tell it officially what it knew already it
regarded the proceedings as painfully loose. The law
has apparently given up all pretence of looking for Grey—
at least nothing has been heard for a long time of any
proposal to track that large insolvent’s footmarks. There
has been talk about his having fled to Europe, but one or
two letters have been received from him of late, and cir-
cumstances connected with these documents create an
impression that Joseph never fled further than Gippsland
—or as far as Gippsland. One Melbourne man has alleged
that if he had any use for Grey—which he hasn’t, the
eminent solicitor not being saleable —he would first of all
fake the train to some place in the Vicinity of Mornington.

A couple of Sydney police have been on the qui
vive lately, hoping to drop on an expert imported safe-
burglar. A few local safes worth opening are above the
skill of Sydney talent, and hence the invitation to the
foreign genius. The police say that a similar incident
occurred about 10 years ago, when a George-street
jeweller’s safe fell before the cunning of an imported
expert.

Prevention of Disease.
Recently a distinguished physician wrote in a
magazine: “The next and greatest advance in
medical science will be the mastery of the art of
preventing disease.” If the phase contemplates
such advances in medical science as may minimise
serious diseases, why put the case in the future ?
All doctors recognise this, or they must leave out
of memory the history of small-pox, Asiatic cholera,
yellow fever, typhus, typhoid, scarlet fevers,
measles, and all kidney diseases.
One hundred years ago one-sixth of all the
deaths in civilised countries were due to small-pox.
When introduced by the Spaniards into Mexico
it killed 3,000,000 of persons within a few years.
Vaccination has mastered it. Other deadly dis-
eases, thanks to the efficacy of our preventative
arts, are now held in check, and even dread
Bright’s Disease of the kidneys, which annually
attacks its thousands, is successfully combated,
and the most malignant forms cured, as demon-
strated in hundreds of cases in England and on
the Continent, and if this preventative is taken at
the first approach of kidney weakness, a failure is
simply impossible. This valuable liver and kidney
specific—Warner’s Safe Cure—is prescribed by
doctors all over the world. It has won distinction
of which we are justly proud. It was originally a
prescription of an eminent physician. The de-
mand became such that the only way it could be
supplied was to put up immense quantities, and
eventually a company was formed which distri-
buted laboratories all over the world to furnish by
the bottle to medicine vendors, from whom it can
now be obtained. Dr. Robert Shaw, L.S.D., M. 8.,
Rockhampton, gives a strong verdict in favour of
this medicine which he has used in prescribing for
k'idney or liver disease. He says : “I have much
pleasure in stating that I prescribed Warner’s Safe
Cure very frequently whilst acting as Medical
Officer on the Cairns-Herberton railway contract
and obtained more satisfactory results from it than
any formulae of my own prescribing.”*
About the effect of bombardments (B.
10/2/’00) Victor Hugo says that during the German
siege of Paris, between one Tuesday and the
following Sunday—s days —25,000 projectiles were
thrown into the city by the German batteries.
They killed 10 men, and did 1400 francs’ worth of
damage to the fortifications. So harmless was the
display that the people crowded to see it, and the
National Guards could hardly make them keep a
safe distance. All this was foolish waste, and did
not hasten the surrender by an hour.
A Woman’s item —by a Mere Man :
How few of the women one sees in Sydney streets can
“ make-up ” decently ! Do the Block, the Arcades, and
King any fine evening, and you’ll hardly find one in a hun-
dred that would pass as a work of Art.
The other 99 dab a lot of powder on their faces and a bit
of rouge on their cheeks, and expect to palm off the re-
sult as “ a good complexion.” The eye and cheek-wrinkles
are generally well hidden, but tbe forehead has to trust
to the fringe to conceal its blemishes, while as to the neck
and the back of the ear—following the line of the jaw—
some very fine wrinkles “ put away ” the face-show.
Also the neck is generally out of the colour-scheme of the
face.
The ear in front often looks passable—white, pink, or
coral; but behind —yellow, drab, or tawny. Even if
women didn’t imitate the conscientious actor who blacked
himself all over to play Othello they would do well to
spread the make-up over a bit more surface.
Then the dabs of rouge on the cheeks should be alike in
position and strength ; not, as often may be seen, strong
and high up on one cheek, and weak and low down on the
other. The back of the ears and the neck also should be
made to agree with the face ; the eyebrows should be of
equal blackness, and the eyelashes should receive some
attention. A lustreless eye is not in harmony with a
bright, fresh, and well-colored face.
A superfluity of powder on chin or cheek looks like fine
fur in a side-light, while, in the hollows of the face, the
powder looks grey and ghastly—almost like cigar-ash.
The use of the blue pencil about the temples, forehead,
and nostrils will give transparency to what otherwise
looks like a whitewashed surface.
And, ladies, give up gold-fillings in your teeth ; or else >
don’t open your mouths or smile. Gold in the back-teeth
always suggests the brass-wire with which the lower jaw
is fastened in skeletons —and when visible in a living
mouth turns a sweet smile into a death’s-head grin. It’s
horrible.
Ladies, I adore Art. I like to see the ugly beautified
and will forgive any deception that really deceives.
“ Student ” to The Bulletin :
Melbourne University students of geology are favorably
impressed with their newly-imported professor, Dr. John
Gregory, of London University. This gentleman—suc-
cessor, by the way, to the Chair rendered vacant by the
death of the late Prof. M‘Coy—belonging to the all-round
type of scientist, like A. W. Howitt, Ralph Tate, Baldwin
Spencer, and Capt. Hutton, F.R.S., is a practical man in
every-day affairs, and believes that a geologist should be
also a competent biologist and ethnologist, to be worth
his salt. Capt. Hutton, Curator of Canterbury Museum,
Christchurch (M.L.), holds some novel and rather in-
teresting views concerning the Origin of Life. According
to him, the Ocean was the Mother of Life, the Sun the
Father. The first living organisms were evolved near the
surface of a warm ocean (about 20 million years ago, in the
Laurentian period) which contained abundance of carbo-
hydrates and atmospheric-air in solution and which was
agitated by the wind and other meteorological agencies—
conditions which are not impossible to reproduce in the
laboratory of modern man, especially as we may safely
assume that the first protoplasm was not so complicated
a substance as it has since become. Chemists have at
last succeeded in forming protein (or “ pepton ”), but
there is still the gap between dead protein and the
simplest living protoplasm to be bridged before life can
be evolved by mechanical means. Having once achieved
the production of a protoplasm capable of secreting
nourishment for its maintenance (chlorophyll), evolution,
superintended and assisted by intelligent operators, must
do the rest. As to the processes whereby the barren
igneous rocks of our primeval earth were slowly
transformed, the professor reasons consistently. On
the surface of the early sea floated the first
organisms whose descendants, some almost unchanged,
. still float and multiply. Presently, some of these found
their way to the bottom, to feed on the sunken debris.
Later, they invaded the coast-line, and at last gained a
footing on the land. But the real work of reclaiming the
desert must be credited to the slow-moving ocean plants,
which, gradually leaving the water, invaded the land (fol-
lowed by a mob of parasitic mobile organisms), dared the
vicissitudes of temperature and moisture in their altered
environment, and thereby made civilisation possible.
Man himself—with ape, lemur, and monkey—diverged
from a common ancestor some 200,000 years ago, in the
Miocene age, and the world itself has a geological history
starting from not less, probably, than 100 million years
ago.
“E.D.” meets a new kind of crank in
Collins-street:—
His actions were so peculiar that I stood on the side of
the road and watched him. He was a man of about 45,
shabby, grizzled and very thin, and he was making wild
ineffectual efforts to cross Collins-street just below The
Age office. He held hir hat in his hand, and every now
and again he would make a savage dash, only to recoil,
beaten back by the’ traffic which was by no means heavy.
Other people were crossing comfortably, but he was
frightened of every vehicle in sight, and getting into the
middle of the tram track, he would be scared by a lumber-
ing vehicle twenty yards off, and scramble back at the
risk of his neck, under the very noses of the horses going
the other way. It seemed amusing till the man came
near, and I saw his face ; it was a dull lead color, his
staring eyes were full of terror, and globules of perspira-
tion hung upon his forehead. He clasped my ann. “Did
you see that?” he said. “They’re doing it on purpose,
the ! They’re doing it on purpose. They’ve got me
set. Look ! look ! There’s another. Ah, ah ! ” He
made another dash behind a piano van, and was within
fifteen feet of the other kerb when he sighted a buggy a
little distance up the street, and fled before it, finding his
way back to me with many insane darts and scrambles.
“Did you see that?” he asked again. “Look at’em 1
Look at ’em ! There they go. More an’ more. They
think they’ll do for me. It’s a conspiracy 1 ” The vehicles
were rolling calmly by, but to the victim the street
seemed full of mad drivers steering frantic horses, and his
eyes glared with excitement and terror. It was a peculiar
'case of D.T. “My——! Just look at’em,” lu muttered,
repeating the words again and again. “ I know what I’ll
do,” he whispered at length cunningly. “I’ll see David
Syme about it. Yes, that’s it, 111 speak to Syme. Look
at ’em ! They’re doin’ it on purpose. But I’ll see Syme.”
He grasped his hat firmly, and made another rush, but
was again beaten back. “ What did I tell you ?” he said.
“ It’s a plot against me, but I’ll speak to Syme.” This
time he dashed across blindly, was knocked down by a
cab, picked himself up, and fled into The Aoe office and
up the stairs, carrying his grievance to the feet of Caesar.
“ W.F.H.” to The Bulletin :
Amusing to note the variety of old moth-eaten flags
that have emerged from their retirement over this war-
business. Thus we see the white ensign flying above a
draper's shop, the royal standard fluttering over a bank,
and the blue ensign above a sixpenny restaurant. Ballarat
recently floated the red ensign over its town hall, and a
local tradesman hoisted the royal standard to signalise
Ladysmith’s relief. Writer always understood the R.S.
to indicate presence of royalty. By the way, the colonial
flag is a union-jack with the colony’s badge in centre.
Consequently, the wrath of Copley and other S.A. legisla-
tors as to the flag recently hoisted above Adelaide Govt.
House, was born of ignorance regarding standards gene-
rally.
[“W.F.H.” is pretty “mixed” himself. The
provincial flag is the blue ensign, with distinguish-
ing badge of the particular province in the lower
“fly.”—Ed. B.]
Stand Back and Then Look.
“ Madam,” said a wise old physician to a woman
who had brought a feeble, anaemic, and poorly de-
veloped daughter to him for examination. ‘ ‘ Madam,
the treatment of this girl should have been begun
two hundred years ago.”
“Sir,” she exclaimed, “I don’t understand
what you mean.”
“ Probably not, madam,” replied this student of
men and medicine, “ and you wouldn’t even should
I try to explain it.”
How do you best see a picture on the wall ? Why,
by standing back and looking through your
hollowed fist or through a tube. Well then, let us
first read Mrs. Coombes’ letter, and afterwards get
a little of what painters call perspective on it and
see if we can understand the lesson it teaches.
“In the spring of last year, 1895,” she says, “I
had an attack of pleurisy, which left me low and
weak. Subsequently I could not get up my
strength, do what I would. My appetite was poor,
and after eating I had severe pains about my chest,
at my side, and between my shoulders. I had
muscular pains in my arms and shoulders—in fact,
all over me. I got little or no sleep, and felt
quite worn out in the morning.
“ As time went on I got weaker and weaker
and was scarcely able to get about. I came to be
so low that I thought I never should be better
again. I saw a doctor and took medicines, but
nothing did me any good.
“In December (1895) my sister, who lives at
Oxford, told me of the benefit she had derived
from Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I got a bottle from
Mr. Cooper, chemist, Oldbury Road, and after
taking it found great relief. I could eat well, and
food agreed with me.
“ I now gained strength, and after taking four
bottles was well as ever and free from all pain,
muscular or otherwise. I know others who have
been benefited by the same medicine. You can
publish this statement as you like. (Signed)
Charlotte Coombes, 177 Oldbury Road, West
Smethwick, Birmingham, October. Bth, 1896.”
That is her letter —a plain, truthful, and well-
written letter. But what do we see. behind the
simple facts as she sets them down ? Is there any-
thing suggested by that attack of plcurisi / she
speaks of? Was that the beginning? No. Pleurisy
is the name given to an inflammation of the spaces
or cavities in which the lungs rest. When the in-
flammation attacks the lungs themselves we call it
pneumonia ; if the bronchial tubes, bronchitis ; and
so on. But they are the same thing, from the same
cause—namely, impure blood. When the blood is
thus polluted, the smallest provocation—a slight
cold —may set up any of the above ailments.
Rheumatism (which Mrs. Coombes had) belongs
to the same group or family of maladies.
But how comes that impurity or corruption of
the blood in which these things arise ? I’ll tell you,
in the hope that you will remember it. Indigestion,
dy.spepsia, fermentation of food in the stomach,
torpid liver, which leaves the bile acids in the
blood instead of removing them, poisonous dirt
and filth from the stomach getting into the cir-
culation —that’s what the trouble comes from. So
we see that in cases of pleurisy, &c., there is al-
ways what the.doctors call a “ history ” of dys-
pepsia. Although this lady had keen dyspeptic
symptoms after the pleurisy, a previous imperfec-
tion of her digestion—whether she realised it or
not—laid the foundation for the pleurisy, the rheu-
matism and all that followed.
Now that is what we see as we stand back and
look. And this is the practical use you are to
make of the knowledge : Take care of the condi-
tion of your stomach, and the first day you feel
anything wrong with it, resort to Mother Seigel’s
Syrup without waiting to find out whether you are
going to be worse or not. When your house takes
fire you don’t wait to see how bad it is likely to be ;
you stop it immediately. Do so with indigestion.
The old doctor was right in what he said to the
woman about her daughter. The girl couldn’t
help the neglect of her ancestors ; but we can do
something towards taking care of ourselves.


S. M. Herald was nofc always so beastly
respectable and formal, not to say starchy, as it is
to-day. In Sydney Herald for Monday, 9th
May, 1831, on page 3, the following quaint items
are found among the police incidents: —
William Collins, for being comfortably coiled in the
mud in the centre of George-street, at one o’clock in the
morning, was ordered seven days’ milling.
Wednesday, May s.—William Morris and Mary Irving
were sentenced each two hours to the stocks for being
found the previous night in a loving embrace in the centre
of the street, laboring under the fumes of rum.
Bartholomew Flinn, who bore in his person a strong
resemblance to an asthmatic gallipot, was placed at the
bar in a sheep-skin, in which rural garb he had been
masquerading in the streets, evidently rather muzzy.
Catherine Galloway, as yellow as a guinea, having just
arrived from Fort Macquarie, was charged with being
three sheets in the wind, and carousing with several
prisoners of the Crown, whom she had wiled to her domi-
cile. The Bench cautioned her not to entertain any more
prisoners, and sentenced her to pay a fine of five shillings ;
Catherine handed over the blunt, dropped a courtsey and
walked off

Chills
Ever become
chilled through and
through ?
The acute sen-,
sat ion of cold is
followed by fever-
ishness and aches in
all parts of the body.
Finally the whole
trouble settles in the
throat and lungs in
the shape of a cough.
There is nothing
so bad for a cough
as coughing.
Cherry.
pectoral
will cure these chills and coughs. A
few doses are sufficient at first. More
time is required later on.
Stop coughing and you will get well.
Keep coughing and you invite bronchi-
tis, pueumonia, or even consumption
itself. Better stop your cough at once
and thus end the whole matter.
Prepared by Dr. J. C. Ayer & Co., Lowell, Mass., U. S. A.
Sir R. Reid, in the House of Commons,
Ist Feb., 1900: —•
What was really the cause of the war ? It was a misun-
derstanding between two nations, fostered by the wicked-
ness and folly of two men, supported and made possible
by the violence of the press, and the lies the press had
been circulating. ... It was when the supporters of the
Government found that they could not justify the war
that they took refuge in the idea of a conspiracy in South
Africa. This conspiracy . . . was a myth . . . fabricated
for the purpose of excusing the consequences of the fatal
policy of the last four or five years.
A smart piece of work was performed by
Messrs. Cope Bros, and Co., of Liverpool, Eng.,
who received an order for two tons of Cavendish
tobacco. It had to be pressed into hard cakes each
weighing three ounces and packed into small kegs
containing 351bs. for transport on the back of
mules. The tobacco was for the use of the British
troops in South Africa, and immediate shipment
was necessary. The order was received at 10 a.m.;
and at 6 o’clock next morning the goods were on
the rail for Southampton, the whole consign-
ment having been prepared and despatched in
about 20 hours.*
English illustrated newspaper war-pictures
represent men fighting in spick-and-span cos-
tumes, fresh from the Pimlico war-office clothing
factory. Ordinary soldiers, as well as officers,
smooth-faced and freshly-shaven a general
parade and sham-fight appearance. Pictures are
mostly roughed-out on the field of battle and
“worked-up” in the London offices, which
accounts for a good deal. Probably the British
public gets what it wants in the shape of war-
pictures. Where the enemy are represented they
are ragged, unkempt and scowling. Yet the
Australian confidential letter-writer (bless him,
he’s giving us some slabs of truth) from the front
says that he hasn’t washed for weeks, sleeps in his
clothes, lets his beard grow, and must exactly
resemble the Boer prisoner; but that wouldn’t
look well in the pictures. Then the dead all lie in
graceful attitudes, and the wounded have smiles of.
pleasurable enjoyment .on their countenances.
Even the photos, are touched-up. Here you have.
a dead soldier—fresli-killed —behind a perforated
iron fence. The corpse has a composed appear-
ance—it is plainly trying to “look pleasant.”
The faces of the dead are retouched —it is plain,
they are posing also. To find the real thing you
must turn to Harper’s Weekly war photos, of
battered Filipinos lying in swathes crumbled up
in the trenches. Why doesn’t some war writer
get inside his own feelings and turn them
inside-out to the world ? Crane evolved the
horrors of war from his inner consciousness
in “The Red Badge of Courage,” but when
depicting the reality from actual sight in Cuba,
he became stodgy and tame. Argus McDonald
began to give us real stuff ; we smelt blood and
felt terror, until he was shut up" in Ladysmith.
Steevens gave us the outer husk of war finely.
We got to know all about the “little querulous
child-like scream of suffering of the man who was
perforated below the navel ” (fatally always), but
no one gave us the terror of the man waiting for
the aforesaid perforation. S. D. Telegraph Wil-
kinson gives us the number of buttons on a war-
correspondent’s coat, but that is alh “ Banjo ”
whirls us along in night-rides, makes us see the
smoking horses, shows us what kind of a horseman
French is, criticises- the other riders —in short,
looks on it as a kind of glorified steeplechase in
which he is a competitor. But he never gets in-
side the skin of the rider. To return to the Eng-
lish pictures—they are magnificent, but they are
not war.

POLITICAL
POINTS
G. H. Reid’s one-time Cabinet colleagues
are never heard of now. Only a N.S.W. politi-
cian with a prodigious memory can recall even
their names.
Staughton, the stupid Tory of Vie.
Assembly, sneeringly : “But everything is possible
in a democracy.” The enemy, hotly, : “No, sir.
In a true democracy, politicians like you would be
impossible ! ”
In little South Australia, with its mere
handful of people—the statisticians have just
agreed upon 370,700 as the province’s population
at the end of ’99—the Govt. Savings Bank had
117,369 depositors.
We have forgotten. In 50 a.d. Caractacus
asked Claudius : “ How is it that you envy me my
poor little cottage in Britain?” and now that
same question, revised up to date, is in the mouths
of the Transvaal farmers.
Two hundred invitations were issued for
the last N.S.W. Federal Freetraders’ meeting in
the Equitable Hall, Sydney, but only 43 persons
attended. “It is very strange,” whispered soft-
goods importer-M'MiUan.
Glassey, M.L.A. (Q.) who is now banging
the Imperialist drum, used to boast on his first
arrival in Queensland that he had been one of
Republican Bradlaugh’s principal organisers and
henchmen in. his great election campaigns.
For loathly crawlsomeness Mornington
(Vic.) shire council takes the prize. It lately
gassed a vote of censure on one of its employes
ecause he used objectionable language about Cecil
Rhodes. And yet Cecil Rhodes is not God.
The Africander delegates, should they
visit Australia, will get some sort of a hearing if,
by the time of their arrival, the Boers are utterly
vanquished. If not, the delegates will be boohooed
and pelted down. For the hour, free speech is
dead.
Melbourne Age broke out in a new place
last week with the announcement ‘that “the
colonials must be consulted as to the terms of any
settlement ” about the Transvaal and Orange Free
State. The “must” is a large and pompous
ultimatum, but this country’s chance, anyhow, of
.being consulted about the settlement is akin to
Buckley’s. And what is the good of a little pro-
vince, armed with an obsolete rifle and the old
Cerberus and Fitzgibbon’s poem, saying “must”
to the British Empire ?
The general election makes comparatively
little difference in the composition of Tasmania’s
Assembly. Four old members retired
and four were beaten; otherwise
things are as they were. Apparently
the Opposition and the Government
are dead level, and the _ Indepen-
dents have to settle what will happen
next. Bitter-minded jingoes yelled
in the public ear that the one essen-
tial was to throw out the eleven Bad
Men who voted against sending the
first contingent, but Tasmania didn’t
throw them out to any great extent.
And the jingo party was guilty of
one woeful oversight. Not a single
candidate was asked if he would
undertake to approve of the next
war that Britain is engaged in. That
was a lamentable hiatus. Approving
of the last war (for it is a last war
now, to all intents and purposes) is no
more practical good than approving
of the Wars of the Roses. Wnat this
country wants is men who are con-
vinced that Britain is in the right
next time, whenever that may be,
and who are prepared to prove it,
and to biff the person who has
doubts with a biff like the fall of
Babylon.
London Times, which was
most vehement and clamorous over the
franchise question, now wants to make
Crown colonies of the Orange River Free State
and the Transvaal. . . . That would settle the
franchise question with a vengeance ; folks in
Crown colonies, as a rule, are not troubled with a
very extensive scheme of local government.
Less than four months ago every jingo in
Australia was furiously angry at the mere sugges-
tion that Britain was fighting a war of annexation
in the Transvaal, and papers and preachers and
politicians cast the aspersion back as a* foul
slander. Yet it seems it 'is a war of annexation,
after all. The British Oovernment says so, and
the whole jingo press says so, and every jingo re-
gards it now as a matter of course. Annexation
is too common a thing for anybody to be either
much surprised or much shocked about it, but the
Jingoes needn’t have done so much needless
lyina - over such a very ordinary matter.
For nearly a decade political campaigns in
N.S.W. have been conducted in damp, muddy,
rheumatic, winter weather. Federal referendums
were no exception. The signs are, however, that
the campaign for the Commonwealth parliament
will be favored with spring or early summer
conditions.
G. H. Reid, asked, when travelling
through Maoriland, what chance he thought there
was of her joining the Federation, replied, “not
until the shoe pinches.” That’s about it. Except
among potatoers and oaters the apathy on the
subject almost equals the ignorance—which, by
the way, G.H.R. made no attempt to enlighten.
In the next Westralian Assembly, to be
elected under the new Act if it is in working order
by then, the Goldfields, on a population basis,
should have 20 members. They are to have eight
—and even that is twice as many as they have
now. And yet the astounded boss-Boer Forrest
wonders what the Goldfields are grumbling about.
The Methodists, Congregationalists, Pres-
byterians and other non-R.C. bodies in Queens-
land are loudly opposing the proposed concession
allowing Grammar School Scholarships to be
taken up and enjoyed in denominational institu-
tions. Though the churches are probably inspired
by trade-jealousy they are nevertheless on the
right track and deserve a successful issue to their
various endeavours.
Thomas Finney, the great Brisbane legis-
lative draper, god of the Brisbane press and firm
supporter of the Continuous Government, left
Queensland the other day for Europe, after pub-
licly advertising that (in matters political) Thomas
Glassey, erstwhile Radical, Republican, Socialist
and Denouncer of Fat Men in General, would act
as his locum tenens. This is what they call break-
ing it gently to the public.
Britain requests the Australian Govern-
ments to make no agreement with the Eastern
Extension cable monopoly before getting the re-
port of the Pacific cable committee, now sitting in
London. This is awkward for the compact which
was to be signed before N.S.W. Parliament could
discuss it. For the Lyne Cabinet, with its mouth
open for “ Birthday ” baubles, is going, you bet,
to do just as J. Bull bids it.
t Be the Sydney Domain grab. Premier
Lyne says “ that should I come to the conclusion
in future that the public parks are being inter-
fered with, I will oppose the project altogether ”
(to make a railway station in it and erect wharves
against it). Well, The Bulletin doesn’t know
what Premier Lyne calls “interfering with,” but
rooting up about 300 trees, making cuttings
through the park, sticking up thereon a huge
dingy railway station, belching great clouds of
sooty smoke over it, lining crowds of steamers
against it, and all the rest of the things
appertaining to railway stations and wharves is,
to its mind, “ interfering with ” the Domain very
considerably. If Premier Lyne had his innards
dug Out, his thatch scraped and torn off in patches,
and a gang of ghouls amused him and themselves
by covering about one-third of him with cockles,
he would possibly consider that he was being
vigorously interfered with.
BOTH AGREED.
FATHER DORRIGAN : “ Look here, Mull n, I don’t
think it wise to send children to the public-
house for drink.”
MULLEN : “ Nayther do Oi, yer riv'rince, for they
git playin’ on Ih ’ road, an ’ the beer gits phla .”
Premier Seddon nearly got washed off his
political feet at last election. Having neglected
to vote for three years previously, his name was
struck off the roll by a dutiful returning officer,
and it was only at the last minute that the Pre-
mier remembered and got enrolled at Wellington.
The S.A. Government has decided that its
section of the next contingent—the one which is
to be paid by the Imperial Government—must be
THE OBVIOUS VOID.
ETHEL: “ Well Charlie, what's the
latest intelligence? ”
OHOLLY : "Weally — er —I haven’t any.”
E THEL: “Of coursel How foolish of me to ask.”
content with the Imperial pay—l/2 a day while
serving in Cape Colony or Natal, and 5/ a day
when outside these limits. N.S.W. proposes to
add 3/4 to the daily pay while serving m Cape
Colony or Natal making a minimum of 4/6. It
will be interesting to see how the Crow-eaters roll
up under these conditions, and it would be still
more interesting if there wasn’t the possibility of
5/ a day, and it was a clear case of 14d. all round.
As a genuine test of public enthusiasm there is
nothing like fourteen pence a day—except seven
pence a day.
When Buller at last relieved Ladysmith,
the mayor and corporation of Albury (N.S.W.)
promptly pasted their little advt. thereon by
cabling to London Daily Telegraph :
Albury, the proposed Federal city, overjoyed at success
of British troops.
This sort of thing gradually accustoms the public
to the idea that Albury is going to be the Federal
city, and that counts for a great deal.
Presentations were made to certain N.S.
Wales politicians who arrogated or were given the
credit of getting the Early Closing law on the
statute-book. Now circulars have been distributed
among civil servants, on whose "behalf a Bill was
lately put through giving them pensions or gra-
tuities after they had been retrenched, requesting
that 5 per cent, of the gratuities be forwarded to
a particular quarter, to go as a presentation to
certain energetic M’s.L. A. who had interested
themselves over the matter in the House. Can it
be possible that there are any N.S. Wales M’s.P.
.who have so little sense of decency that they do
not decline such gifts in advance, but, on the
contrary, allow themselves to be suspected of
seci’etly log-rolling to squeeze these recognitions
out of a class relieved by Parliament ?
“Ricardo”: Germany's naval ambition
is mainly directed against the United States. The
only field open for Germany is South America.
1 am not giving my own ideas, except as sug-
gested by thinkers in recent English periodical
literature. Brazil and the Argentine are the ob-
jectives of Germany, working slowly. Of course
the knob is the United States, with the Monroe
doctrine, but the question is how far that has been
impaired by the U.S. action in Cuba, the Philli-
pines and Hawaii. Is non-extension a corollary of
the Monroe doctrine ? Can that be cut off at Nicar-
agua ? Without a doubt nothing will ever dare
to lay a hand on Mexico. Meanwhile Germany
and the United States are going for the ships.
England, of course, will not raise a finger against
Germany in South America.
They aren’t too particular about the smell
of their politics in Tasmania. Captain Miles, the
remarkable master-mariner who
only a few months ago, had to
resign his portfolio in the
Braddon Ministry and
his seat in Parliament
over the Strahan Ma-
rine Board scandal—
who was found guilty
of shameful conduct
by a Parliamentary
Board of Inquiry,
and whose moral
reproach dragged
down the Braddon
Ministry on top of

And Cameron, the

jected at Deloraine by

In view of the bad
state of Australia’s de-
fences, Melbourne Punch
desires that a loan be
immediately floated in
London and an adequate
supply of up-to-date
weapons procured. The
Bulletin moves as an
amendment that an extra
Id. in the £ land-tax be
immediately levied in all
the federating provinces,
and the proceeds be de-
voted to the purchase of
arms and ammunition. If
Australia isn’t game to pay for
its oVn defences with its own
money, then it is the sort of Diace
that doesn’t deserve to be defended.
One of the main points of objection by
the Imperial Government to the Commonwealth
Constitution Bill is the abolition of the right of
appeal to the Privy Council. Admitting all
the benefits derivable from appeal on points
of law to a highly - intellectual court utterly
unswayed by local prejudices, there is as
a set-off the Privy Council’s want of knowledge
of Australian circumstances. Also, it is a poor
country that can’t grow its own justice. Never-
theless, the Australian delegates mostly lawyers,
can be relied on to meet as far as possible Imperial
views as to the expediency of an Australian liti-
gant being dragged across 12,000 miles of sea tb
obtain what he should be able to get for a day or
two’s railway journey at most.
N.S.W. Premier Lyne told a recent depu-
tation that “ he had no desire to take any portion
of any Sydney park —no one had less desire to do
so than he.” He had merely, he said, referred
the proposal to take for wharfage purposes the
finest portion of Sydney’s finest park to the Public
Works Committee. Yet the only convenient way
to take the park is per medium of the Public
Works Committee. The man who yearned most
intensely to build wharves along the park frontage
could hardly do it otherwise than through the
Public Works Committee. Lyne’s action was
that of a man who wanted to takb the Domain
frontages. The man who didn’t want to —and he
says he is that man—should have refused to sub-
mit the matter to the Public Works Committee.
It is a cheerful item of news that a very
large portion of the Boer ammunition came from
the English Kynoch firm in which Judas Chamber-
lain’s brother Arthur is managing director.
Comparison of some duties in the “heavily-
taxed Transvaal ” with those in the British African
colonies adjacent thereto :
'Jape Colony,

So far as these articles of food were concerned, the
Transvaaler is far better off than hisßritish neighbor
—who, by the way, taxes the Transvaal by impos-
ing special transit duties on goods which pass
tlnther through British territory. The following
figures can be found in the Statesman’s Year
Book ■, —Transvaal, 1896 (the more recent returns
have apparently not arrived): Imports, £14,088,130;
customs duties levied, £1,355,486, 'or a little over
9J per cent, all round. Cape Colony, 1896:
Imports, £18,771,371; customs duties levied,
£2,170,049, or over Uj per cent, all round. The
“oppressive Boer tariff”!! Australian tariffs
run up to over 25 per cent, all round, or nearly
three times what the Boer levies.


At the Criterion Theatre, Miss Noni
Rickards has been rendering “The Cunning Sort
of Bushy,” and responsive audiences have con-
tributed the sum of £373. The collections were
made by the Misses Fanny Powers, May Smith
and Ethel Smith, and Master Freddy Davis. Mr.
Harry Rickards has marked his appreciation of
their efforts by presenting each of the little ones
with a souvenir Bushman’s Medal, struck by
Messrs. H. Potier and Co., of Royal Arcade, in
gold. Miss Noni Rickards, on Saturday night,
also received a similar token, inscribed, “Pre-
sented by Harry Rickards to his darling daughter,
Noni Rickards, for singing ‘ The Cunning Sort of
Bushy,’ in aid of the Sydney Bushmen’s Con-
tingent, realising £373 7s. Id.” Similar medals
are being prepared for the Misses Lizzie and
Maggie Clarence and Alma Gray, who collected
in Melbourne over £294 during the rendition of
patriotic songs by Mr. Hahn.*

Melb. people begin to ask if Madden has
succeeded Haddon and Wiilowlullaby on the
Argus. For two or three weeks past His
Waxeloquency has grabbed every chance of
appropriating a column or more a day. [This is
not strictly accurate, but The Bulletin never is
accurate.] One day recently he had two letters
and a speech to the battle-bullion-bearing Chinkies
in the ponderous daily, and folks turned gladly to
the tallow market.
Extract from letter from Private Stanton
of the N.S.W. Transvaal Contingent, recently
published in Sydney Telegraph :
When within 800 yards of the farm, we halted, and the
infantry blazed a volley into the house. We then marched
up to it, and on arrival found it locked up and not a soul
to be seen, so we broke open the place and went in. It
was beautifully furnished, and the officers got several
things they could make use of, such as bedding, etc.
There was a lovely library—books of all descriptions,,
printed in Dutch and English. I secured a Bible, also a
Mauser rifle; but lam afraid I will lose the latter, as several
others got rifles, but the officers would not allow them to
be kept. I would like to keep it; it is quite new, and
almost the same as our new .303 magazine rifle, only the
bullet is a shade smaller. After getting all we wanted
out of the house, our men put a charge under it and blew
it up. It seemed such a pity. It was a lovely house,
with a nice garden round it.
A good many such descriptions come along of the
brutal, dirty, ignorant Boer’s nice houses and
libraries, and musical instruments, and so forth.
And the Australian cocky, whose sons help to fur-
nish the Contingents, and whose own home is
built on the plan of unlettered Old Dad’s hut, still
believes all the stories about the Dutchman’s dirt
and illiteracy. Further on Private Stanton
writes:
We had not arrived very long here before we were put
to work, as we had several patients sent to us, including
two Boer prisoners with slight injuries. I was put guard
over the latter, with a drawn sword, but they did not
attempt to escape. If they had, I don’t think I would
have hesitated very long to give them a taste of the steel.
My word !
“ Cockey ” writes :
Your paragraphist who states that Australia is about
the last place where any reasonable person would look for
the lost Roger Tichborne is talking nonsense. The Ticb-
borne case has been before the public for about 30
years, and by now the facts, theories and frauds of the
case should be known to every journalist in Australia wbo
ventures to open his mouth on so stale a subject. Roger
Tichborne sailed from Buenos Ayres in the ship Bella,
supposed to be bound for New York. The Bella disap-
peared, and nothing that can he called positively true has
ever been heard of any of the crew or passengers. There
is a doubt as to whether Roger Tichborne was the only
passenger aboard apart from the crew, of course. If the
Bella didn’t founder in mid-ocean (which she probably did)
or get burned to the water’s edge, there was but one
thing could have happened to account for ber being
posted as missing at Lloyd’s. A seizure of the ship by
the captain and crew, in which case the Bella’s identity
would be • painted out of existence. The yarn of the
Cresswellites lays stress upon the fact that Australia in
1854 was the new Land of Gold. Assuming that the cap-
tain and crew did seize the Bella and change her name to
Osprey, their motive can be taken for granted. They
wanted to get to Ballarat and dig for nuggets. The
Cresswellites make out that the stolen ship Osprey (nee
Bella) arrived at Melbourne in July, 1854, the crew
immediately bolting for the diggings, leaving Roger Tich-
borne to come ashore by himself and get drunk and lose
himself for the rest of his days.
“Ex-R.E.”: If as stated (B. 3/10/’00)Col.
Onslow threw up his billet in N.S.W. Bush corps
“as a protest against the apparently scandalous
treatment meted out to his friend Capt. Larkin,”
the Colonel was not the less standing from
under to escape the crash which must come.
Capt. Larkin is less to be pitied than some people
think. As Adjutant he would not have had a bed
of roses. An Adjutant is by far the hardest-
worked man of his corps, responsible for the order,
discipline, and duty of the whole, never off duty
himself, the first man on parade, and last off.
Whoever else neglects his duty, the Adjutant must
not fail in his. If that is the position of the
Adjutant of a regularly disciplined corps in which
everyone knows his work and the routine of duty
goes on like clockwork, what must it be with an
undisciplined crowd like the Rangers? Not an
officer among them, except possibly the command
and second in command, can be relied on for
support. The squadron leaders know little or
nothing more of their duty than the men they lead,
and the subalterns are worse. Whether Capt.
Larkin would have been a good Adjutant no one
can say. He certainly knew as much drill as his
supplanter, and being an older man with some
business tact, should be a better manager of men.
Neither he nor young Ryrie could have had much
experience of administration, and therein lies the
weakness of the Australian forces. There is no
school where regimental duty, as distinguished
from drill, can be learned.
The three Methodist sects —the Wes-
leyans, Primitives, and Bible Christians—have at
last federated in South Australia; and their first
annual conference has just been held. Rev. Bur-
fess (hon. “Dr.” of the ’Murkan Methodist
Jniversity) was chosen first president; he was a
few years back likewise chosen first president of
the federal council, which the Methodists of all
the provinces formed. And yet, as a preacher,
Rev. Burgess is in no higher than the fourth
class; he is better on the platform, still better as
a writer, best of all as an administrator. In
patting the youngsters’ heads and taking afternoon
tea —most important parts of a pirson’s duties —
he was such an utter failure that sometimes it was
difficult to get a “ circuit ” to take him; which
indicates what a handicap brains are to the
modem minister.
Vic. Full Court has hesitatingly com-
promised with the old rule that an articled clerk
must not be absent from the direct guidance of his
mentor during any portion of the five years’ term.
In this particular case, the youthful aspirant for a
wig was away about six weeks, managing a branch
of his boss’s business, but the absurd idea was that
a man who would be a legal expert after five
years’ “swatting” as a mere clerk, remained a
hopeless incompetent if his master considered him
good enough to manage a law business. Having
infringed his articles, he was supposed to do the
whole five years over again, but Madden, C.J.,
and brothers Holroyd and Hodges now say that he
can serve six weeks extra and put it right that
way.
The drought in N.W. Queensland has
been throttling man and beast for the last three
years, but a good season was confidently looked
forward to in 1900. And all during February, the
wet-season month, barring very few and scattered
storms, it has not rained a drop. Drought, a real
old-man edition, stands at the door. Just as
hundreds of grazing selectors, men with small
capital and large experience, have settled down
and invested their all to make homes for them-
selves in the West! What a continuance of the
present weather means to Q. is hard to put into
words. And still there are people who marvel at
the ferocious gloominess of bush literature.
BANNERMAN OF THE DANDENONG.
(AN AUSTRALIAN BALLAD.)
(BY ALYCH W[?]RNEE.)
I rode through the Bush in the burning noon.
Over the hills to my bride,—
The track was rough and the way was long.
And Bannerman of the Dandenong,
He rode along by my side.
A day’s march off my Beautiful dwelt,
By the Murray streams m the west
Lightly lilting a gay love-song
Rode Bannerman of the Dandenong,
With a blood-red rose on his breast,
“Red, red rose of the Western streams*
Was’ the song he sang that day—
Truest comrade in hour of need, —
Bay Mathinna his peerless steed—
-1 had my own good grey.
There fell a spark on the upland grass—
The dry bush leapt into flame ;
And I felt my heart go cold as death, _
And Bannerman smiled and caught his breath—
But I heard him name her name.
Down the hill-side the fire-floods rushed,
On the roaring eastern wind ;
Neck and neck was the reckless race,—
Ever the bay mare kept her pace,
But the grey horse dropped behind.
He turned in the saddle —“ Let’s change, I say 1
And his bridle rein he drew.
He sprang to the ground,—“ Look sharp ! he said
With a backward toss of his curly head—
“ I ride lighter than you ! ”
Down and up—it was quickly done —
No words to waste that day !
Swift as a swallow she sped along,
The good bay mare from the Dandenong,—
And Bannerman rode the grey.
The hot air scorched like a furnace blast
From the very mouth of hell ;
The blue-gums caught and blazed on high
Like flaming pillars into the sky ; ...
The grey horse staggered and fell.
“ Ride, ride, lad,—ride for her sake !” he cried ,
Into the gulf of flame
Were swept, in less than a breathing space,
The laughing eyes, and the comely face,
And the lips that named Her name.
She bore me bravely, the good bay mare :
Stunned, and dizzy, and blind,
I heard the sound of a mingling roar, —
’Twas the Lachlan River that rushed before,
And the flames that rolled behind.
Safe —safe, at Waranga gate,
I fell, and lay like a stone.
O love ! thine arms were about me then—
Thy warm tears called me to life again,—
But—o God ! that I came alone 1
I and my Beautiful dwell in peace
By the Murray streams in the West, —
But oft through the mist of my dreams along
Rides Bannerman of the Dandenong,
With the blood-red rose on his breast.
SONNET.
Methought I saw a dark, defiant face,
With fierce lips set in everlasting scorn,
And backward-blown wild locks by storm-blasts torn.
Sad eyes, deep-caverned—not without the grace
Of tenderness, that found no resting-place
In that despairing -world, whereinto born,
He knew not how to make it less forlorn—
And so defied, and died ; men call him base.
I saw this man ; before his feet there knelt
A haunted, haggard slave with fettered Jimb,
And branded cheek. “ Nay—what is mine is thine !”■
Smiled he, and raising, flung an arm around him.
“ Who art thou? ” And before I heard, I felt
His answer —“ Lucius Sergius Catiline.”
IN A THEATRE.
Capua, 72 b.c.
We were friends and comrades loyal though I was of alien
race,
And he a free-born Samnite that followed the man from
Thrace,
And there, in the mid-arena, he and I stood face to face.
I was a branded swordsman, and he was supple and strong.
They saved us alive from the battle, to do us this cruellest
wrong,
That each should slay the other there before the staring
throng.
Faces—faces —and faces ! how it made my brain to spin !
Beautiful faces of women, and tiger-souls therein !
And merry voices of girls that laughed/debating of who
should win.
Over us, burning and cloudless, dazzled the blue sky’s
dome;
Far away to the eastward the white snow-peaks of his
home ;
And in front the Prefect, purple-clad, in the deadly might
of Rome.
And so, in the mid-arena, we stood there face to face,
And he looked me right in the eyes and said, “ I ask thee
one last grace—
Slay me, for thee I cannot.” Then I held his hand a
space.
But knew not what I answered ; the heavens round and
wide
Surged up and down—a flash of steel —my sword was
through his side,
Arid I was down upon my knees, and held him as he died.
His blood was warm on my fingers, his eyes were scarcely
still,
When they tore him from me, and the blade that else had
healed all ill.
And it is one more day I am theirs, to work their will.
No matter ! the sand, and the sun, and the faces hateful
to see,
They will be nothing—nothing ! but I wonder who may be
The other man I have to fight—the man that shall kill me!
THE UPAS-TREE.
There fell a seed of the Upas-tree,
I know not whence it came to me,
I know not how or when it fell,
But I marked the spot and I loved it well,
The young, green shoot of the Upas-tree.
It grew and spread—the Upas-tree,
Its leaves were comely and fair to see,
And the lithe brown boughs like snakes to behold,
And the fruit was apples of burning gold ;
And my heart was glad of the Upas-tree.
My heart was mad for the Upas-tree,
I loved and cherished it jealously ;
Nought had I loved so through all the years,
With burning heart’s blood and bitter tears,
I watered the roots of my Upas-tree.
My heart was mad for the Upas-tree,—
It knew nought else upon earth and sea :
Against its trunk I laid my breast,
And my arms clung round it as to their rest,—
O my beautiful Upas-tree 1
O my beautiful Upas-tree 1
It flung and it curled its boughs round me,
They curled and they clung, and my limbs and breast
Felt the throbs of their poison like fire—and blest
Was my heart for the pain of the Upas-tree !
O the fierce delight of the Upas-tree !
It burned out the heart and soul from me;
And the wild pain deadened to dull and slow,
But it held me-and would not let me go—
Held in the clasp of the Upas-tree 1
O the deadly clasp of the Upas-tree !
My. soul was gone—and the limbs of me
Grew into one with those twining boughs,
And I loathed the ghastly prison house —-
But nought can save from the Upas-tree 1
Now am I one with the Upas-tree,
And scatter poison o’er hill and lea t
Heart, soul, nor brain is left to me—
Nothing of all I used to be —
And 1 am only the Upas-tree.
“ lOH ABER ....'*
Awhile my heart has been anchored,
But she tugs at her anchor-chains,
She is weary of the harbor
With its quiet pleasures and pains.
Sweet, sweet is the quiet life
And the shelter of the home —
But O 1 for the dashing billows
And the flying sheets of foam.
Out of the East the horsemen
Game with the lance and bow,
Out of the sandy deserts,
Out of the steppes of snow.
Out of the East my fathers
Game in the days of old—
Out of the sandy deserts,
Spearmen and archers bold.
And their spirit is within me,
I feel when the winds are high—
And O 1 for a steed in the desert!
For I must wander, or die.
And O ! for the ship of the Norsemen,
And the blinding, drifting foam —
For the sons of men are my brothers,
And the wide, world is my home !
And O ! for the crashing cannon,
And the clash of swords at strife,
And the loyal love of comrades,
And the fierce red wine of life !
For the North wind and the South wind—
The iceberg and the floe,
And the grim and lonely waters
Where the great whales come and go 1
For the East wind and the West wind,
And the mountain-peaks of snow—
The palms, and the starry passion-blooms
In the land of Mexico !
Oh ! why did the blood within me
Throb strong from a wandering race,
If I must grow for ever
In one still dwelling-place ?
Oh ! why did God send me wandering,
While my childish eyes were dim,
O’er the wide waste Southern waters
Where man is alone with him ?
And these broken visions, these echoes
That linger in soul and brain . . .
Gan you wonder I am restless
And long to go forth again ?

The notion that every Chow is a kind,
considerate leper to the white girl who shares his
den was further falsified by the evidence in a
Melb. Criminal Court case, the other day. Willie
Ock Sam charged his unfortunate Clistian para-
mour with stabbing him in his Celestial neck, but
the cross-examination disclosed the fact that W.
0. Sam had, for his part, often kicked and knifed
the lady. Also, he stolidly admitted that on the
night previous to Nellie’s insurrection he had
thrown a bucket of water over her and had
dragged her around the yard to get her dry. The
Mongolian knows how to dissemble his love, allee
same lallikin.
Letter to the editor of an English religious
paper: —
Sir, —I do not understand why private persons, even if
they happen to be priests in charge of missions, should he
called upon either to express an opinion regarding the
justice of this unhappy war in South Africa, or to pray
for the triumph of the British arms. I must frankly de-
clare that I shall do neither. To me it seems that for an
individual, ignorant of the state of the case, and de-
pendent wholly on newspapers, to decide between the
parties at issue would be little less than insane. And if I
do not know—as I for one certainly do not —which of
these parties is in the right, I am scarcely in a position to
call on the Supreme Judge as if I did know, and implore
Him to give England the victory. I can pray for peace,
and Idoso ; I can ask that all suffering may be spared
which is not requisite to teach men a lesson, to correct or
to warn them against the vices now rampant among us of
money-worship and luxurious self-seeking; I can pray
heartily in the only fit language : “ God defend the right.”
But as a Christian, and a priest, how shall I take upon
myself the burden of dictating to the Almighty what issue
He shall give to a combat like this ? I cannot understand
the patriotism which makes to itself a national God,
English, Dutch, or African ; and accordingly I decline to
lay upon the altar of my personal prejudices a petition
for victory to tfie side where birth or position happens to
have placed me.—Yours,
Dorchester, Oxon, Dec. 29.

“Dominion over palm and vine.”—Emer-
son. “ Dominion over palm and pine.” —Kipling.
One of the law’s standing jokes is the dis-
tracted old woman who has no lawyer and no
money and a tangled brain, and who wants to
bring her case informally before the court because
she doesn’t know the slow, agonising processes of
red tape that she ought to go through in order to
catch the eye of the Awful One dressed in long
gray rags. Melbourne had an interlude of this
sort the other day. The old lady had once
possessed some property and had mortgaged it.
Then, in ways which she couldn’t understand, the
mortgage had settled down on her and crushed
the life out of her. She had no property now.
She didn’t know how she had lost it. The mys-
teries of compound interest and costs and ejection-
expenses and foreclosure and depreciation of land
values were beyond her. She was a broken and
confused old person who wanted to know, and she
appeared in court as an utterly bewildered de-
fendant with a bagful of documents. She didn’t
even know how to lay the bag officially before the
court. Not being able to understand legal expres-
sions, she might as well have been crying out in
Sanscrit to a Dutchman on a kopje. But she fur-
nished the Court with a pleasant hour or two,
especially when this letter was put in as evidence:
I beg to notify you that I hav this day give notice to my
tenements 43/45 Westgarth-street to quite and giv up
pecabl possession of my property. You profess to repre-
sent a Bank. I think you are labouering under a great
mistake. It must be a Tote shope with cadds and black-
legs. . . . I will now get a pettion signed by the people
of Gippsland and Fitzroy to the Premier of the Colony.
Surely there is still salt on the earth. I have sufficient
black and white to prove me right, and such dambel
scounderls ought to be brought to bay. Yours respt.


An Old Indian Soldier.
“ Now is the time,” says the N"owra Leader,
“ when the war fever is upon us, to interview
soldiers.” So being aware that Mr. J. Collins, of
this town, had seen service in India, we called
upon him.
“ I shall be pleased to tell you what I can,” said
Mr. Collins when told that the Leader wished to
interview him.
“Where did you first enlist, Mr. Collins?”
“I enlisted at home and my regiment was
ordered to India. We were there four years and
I received much valuable training, but the cli-
mate was very trying and I suffered greatly from
ague and shivering fits. I became so debilitated
that at the end of the four years service I was un-
fit for duty. The army doctor did not cure me. I
always had pains in my back and chest, could
never eat, and was too weak to work.”
“ What was your next move?”
“Well, I was advised to go to sea, and I shipped
in a Bengal trader, but the work and the climate
of India were too much, and I came to Australia.
Here I consulted several doctors, but only ob-
tained temporary relief. About eighteen months
ago I read in the paper of a cure by Dr. Williams’
pink pills. The case seemed very much like mine,
so I bought six boxes. The first box relieved me,
and the six boxes cured me. I have regained my
appetite, and increased in weight, and I am so
strong and active that I can work almost as well
as ever. If it had not been for Dr. Williams’
pink pills I would probably have had to throw
myself upon state charity.”
In Mr. Collins’ case ordinary medical treatment
and ordinary medicine failed. It is in such cases
that Dr. Williams’ pink pills effect their most
sensational oures; their purifying and re-con-
stituent effect upon the blood is such that all
disease and impurity is removed. As a nerve
tonic they are unequalled, and therefore cure St.
Vitus’ dance, paralysis, neuralgia, and all nerve
troubles. They also cure rheumatism, con-
sumption, weak lungs, heart palpitation, skin
disorders, dysentery, and sleeplessness. Sold by
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place,
Sydney, two and nine per box, and by chemists
and storekeepers—But mind you ask for Dr.
Williams’—and be sure you get them.*

“ Unlike a recent Bulletin correspondent pre-
sent scribe encounters few household - slaveys ’
infected with mania for internal operations.
Lucky Lizer-Ann, with her ‘ boy ’ to trot her
round and keep her lively, is, as a rule, less
tempted than her social superiors to seek excite-
ment in the surgery; of some fascinating sawbones.
Besides, suave specialists are luxuries beyond the
purses of improvident dish-wallopers, while gratis
medical ministrations in charitable institutions
lack all that makes operation worth undergoing.
Many an out-back governess, aching with mono-
tony, hoards her hard-won fees and goes to town
to spend her holidays in Dr. What’s-his-name’s
private hospital. Also, there s a type of
bored, ailing, well-to-do married woman, bet-
ter than gold-mines to her pet practitioner.
Such as these, having once sniffed chloroform,
been sympathetically soothed under its spell and
caressingly coaxed back to consciousness, never
rest till they repeat the experience. This form of
dissipation grows upon its devotees, who may be
recognised by their demeanor at the shrine of their
Idol? The first whiff of ether in a dentist’s cham-
ber of horrors sends a sophisticated patient into
hysterics, and after the show is over, you don’t
catch her coming to a minute sooner than she can
help. These tactics ensure that the handsome
tooth-artist and the winsome anesthetist trot out
their prettiest tricks, thus giving their knowing
‘ case ’ the worth of her money, and spinning out
the span of her enjoyment.
“ Melb. to Brighton rail way-carriage ; young
lady in comer producing cigarette-case: ‘ Does
any of you gentlemen object to smoking ? ’ It

“ High Church people are fasting, and fish-
mongers are doing a roaring trade. Blue cod,
flounder, trout, turbot, whitebait, etc., are in de-
mand: the godly are mortifying the flesh. Soups are
made of milk, cream, vegetables. Oysters and an-
chovy are in demand for flavoring; and a delicate
mayonnaise finds perpetual place on the lunch-
table. However, some fasters adopt _ a drastic
regimen. How is this for the humiliation of the
fleshly man, the same being a suburban curate.
Bed of planks, covered with a sheet, and above,
for warmth, a rough blanket. Food —bread,
water, weak tea, occasionally porridge, without
milk or sugar. On Sundays only, a little meat.
Never enough of anything except water. Con-
tinual prayers. One wonders what crimes this
particular curate has committed. As far as one
knows, he is so good, so.earnest, not very clever,
not very anything except earnest and humorless.
“Directly opposite a fashionable hotel there
stands the office of an important ‘firm’ in the
money line of business. The other day the slaves
of the pen got a hasty summons from an irrepres-
sible office-boy to come and watch a couple spoon-
ing in the sunlight at the window of the hotel.
The recklessly happy pair must have been in the
first chapter of their honeymoon, for after leaning
mid-way out of window with their arms round
each other’s neck, and kissing to break the mono-
tony, they withdrew their heads from the window,
and sat down to a long, unbroken osculation on a
couch, quite visible to the grinning ledger-
clerks. By this time, however, the boss
had come to hear of these amorous dallyings,
and he despatched a messenger with a note
to- the new Benedict, advising him, probably,
to restrain his feelings or let down the blind.
Then followed a scene of confusion. There was a
glimpse of a sudden flying female, followed by her
Eartner in embarrassment, blushing at the back of
is ears. Later in the afternoon young Strephon
called upon the considerate person across the
road to express his gratitude for the note of
warning, and the boss, still sensible of the curiosity
of his minions, let his visitor out of the building by
the back-lift.
“ The queen of local fortune-tellers has retired —
one presumes with a very comfortable bank bal-
ance, for every Melbourne girl has been to her to
have her hand read at least once. The men who
went also were legion, but they were ashamed of
‘ countenancing such rubbish,’and seldom owned
up to it. The somewhat gypsy-like Scotchwoman
made her last public appearance at ‘ Goathlands ’
on Saturday, and helped to add a considerable
sum towards the Mayoress’s Hospital Fund. She
certainly possessed in a high degree the gift com-
monly known as ‘second sight.’. Added to this
were tact, intuitions carefully trained, and a mar-
vellous knack of inducing her clients to give
themselves away unawares. Melbourne will miss
her, for it has no other palmist of her capacity,
and one spent very pleasant half-hours with Mrs.
L., retiring from her very commonplace little
sitting-room with an exaggerated opinion of one’s
own importance, a thrill of expectation towards
promised voyages, love affairs, ‘ jooleryj and so on.
“ Popular Sophie Osmond got a hearty send-off
from the Salonites on Saturday afternoon. Dr.
Neild broke- into the fag-end of the musical pro-
gramme with a few sweet remarks concerning the
buxom identity and her determination to see what
Dear Old England is made of, after which Sophy
broke into tears. Then the gathering came to the
rescue witli “ She’s a jblly good fellow,” and the
heroine of the occasion managed to get through
her little speech in pen-womanly style.
“The late Hamilton Mackinnon’s alert and
enterprising eldest son was married, the other
day, to Miss Edith Orr, of Ballarat. It was a
very chic affair, of course, for Mrs. Willie Orr has
always been renowned for her taste and general
smartness. All Ballarat talks of her diamonds
and dresses, and all feminine Ballarat of her laces
and so on. Mr. Mackinnon and his bride are re-
turning to India, with which country he trades in
horses.
“ The most impressive feature of last Friday’s
‘ Hamlet ’ at the onionodorous Alexandra was a
widow’s cap in the d.c.—the piquant cap of a
rather youngish widow with a classical face and a
partially-restored animation. Two girls, not in
mourning, acted as body-guard to the gentle relict,
whose brief occasional smiles suggested that she
may be feeling worldly again when the winter
come 3. All the same she made it very evident
that a play by the Divine Bard is not a secular
form of entertainment. The clean-cut convales-
cent merely smiled as though she were at church
and the thread of her melancholy had been broken
by the comic cough of a worshipper in the next
pew.
“The so-called ‘soft sex’ has its savage
moments. Two of the ‘ bushmen,’ ’tis said, have
been goaded to the war by their mother, who
vainly urged them to volunteer for the two former
contingents. Now she has got her wish, though
one of the boys dreads the sea so much that he
never expects to see Africa.
“ Rev. Smith M‘Bain, who goes to the war with
the ‘ Bushies ’ as chaplain (Pres.) without pay, is
the nephew and adopted son of the late James
M'Bain. That kindly magnate had no children of
his own, but his snug home at Toorak was always
shared with nephews and nieces, the bairns of less
opulent Scotch kinsfolk. In the old times, the
military chaplain of to-day, who sings ‘The
Sleeping Camp’ at camp : concerts, was a bright-
faced boy, in Eton Suit and broad collar, who
nightly lifted up his voice in * The Midshipmite, ’
to please his fond uncle. When the latter, com-
pletely crushed in health and spirits, succumbed to
Boom troubles, his wife was left a deaf, dazed,
decrepit mourner among the ruins of her pros-
perity. Parson M‘Bain, then only a youngling,
showed himself the right sort, went back with his
kinswoman to her native parish and the friends of
her youth, and devoted himself to her till she died.
“ Used skilfully a soda-water syphon is a most
effective weapon. The other night there was a
row in a city bar-room, and one man who was
making himself peculiarly objectionable turned
with a swagger and many oaths to the barmaid.
She, with a skilful hand, pressed the handle of a
syphon, and he received a stream of soda-water in
the eye which effectually cooled his ferocity and
his eloquence, and spoiled his shirt front.
“A well-known Melboumite was loudly brag-
ging in a fashionable London hotel of how things
were done in Australia. He compared many
things much to the disfavor of England, and con-
cluded by explaining that * lolanthe ’ had been
produced at Melb. Princess’s in a style far sur-
passing anything he had seen in London. He
turned for confirmation to his son, who had been
standing by, much bored with the old man’s brag.
‘lsn’t that so, George?’ George shrugged his
shoulders. ‘Can’t say, dad. I was doing six
months, you remember, when “lolanthe” was
on.’ Complete collapse of dad, and considerable
coldness of audience, who naturally concluded
that anything was possible in Australia !

The fall of Bloemfontein seems to have
been as willing as the surrender of a maiden’s
yielding waist to the arm of her best Adolphus.
Also the city put on its best holiday attire for the
occasion just as the maiden aforesaid would pre-
pare for the devoutly-to-be-wished-for squeeze by
donning a P.D. corset. Eor, as everyone, knows,
the P.D. captures the man before he takes posses-
sion of the shapely wearer.*
A Bulawayo (Rhodesia) correspondent of
Edinburgh Scotsman (the most fulsomely
loyal of British papers), writing just before the
outbreak of the S’african war, said :
I suppose by the time you get this we will all know
if it is war with the Transvaal or not. These con-
stant disputes are keeping this country back terribly.
No one will enter into any speculation whilst these
war-clouds are about, and it is hard to say who is to
blame, as there is no doubt Britishers are badly
treated in so far as political rights are concerned,
for which, of course, Jameson is to blame ; but, if
you look underneath all this, you will find that, up
to the time of the raid, Britishers were all doing well,
earning splendid money, and with all the comforts
of home, for Johannesburg is not a pioneer place like
this, but a big magnificent city, and if the few ambitious
capitalists had left things alone until a political agitation
was necessary, or until the masses called for one, this so-
called festering sore would never have festered at all.
But now that things have reached this pass, it is better
that it should be settled once and for all, as the whole
country is paralysed in trade, and the Dutch population
really think that Britain is a military power of only
secondary consideration.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
That sturdy little Cape Malay (Tom Easier),
misnamed “the Kaffir,” went close to going under m his
struggle with burly blacksmith Tom Taylor’s pet pupil,
Lenton, Thursday night last, at Metrop. A.C. (Sydney).
It was all fight from end to end. Essler had a good
until the knuckles of his right went in the seventh round,
then Lenton took a turn. Once he sent the ebony-hued
man right through the ropes, and latter in getting back
bumped his jaw hard. Big doses of stoush were given
and taken without a wince. For 13 rounds the black was
worsted, but he kept coming for his gruel as if he loved
it, while the crowd went crazy with excitement. Essler
lasted till the limit (20 rounds), and as articles provided
that if both were on their feet then a draw should be
declared, there was no winner. Under ordinary condi-
tions it would have been amoral for Lenton, the pluckiest
kid (he’s no more) seen in the Sydney ring for many a
day.

Interprovincial battle between middleweight
pugs. Atkinson (of Melb.) and black Tom Mitchell
(N.S.W.), at Sydney Metrop. A.O. last week, didnt
amount to much, and a big crowd went home full to the
brim of disappointment. Weights were announced :
Atkinson, lOst. ; Mitchell, 9.12. Writer wanted to wager
that both scaled pounds more —particularly Atkinson —
but couldn’t get on. Mitchell, lathy-built and lissom,
was a striking contrast to Atkinson, heavy-limbed and
comparatively slow ; also, the former’s dark skin seemed
darker than ever alongside the Melb. man’s unusually
white pelt. Atkinson forced things _ from the outset ;
Mitchell jigged away with legs and wings very much in
evidence. Mitchell let Atkinson get out of comers fre-
quently in very soft fashion. This happened round after
round. Now and again the darkey would stand his
ground and send a few home, but he doesn’t relish being
too close. The crowd jeered and tried to sool Mitchell
on, but ’twas no go ; he fought in his own way. At the
opening of the tenth round the black came across to the
white’s corner ; a few exchanges resulted, and the former
suddenly sent in a crushing right hook on the temple,
bringing Atkinson down against the ropes, apparently
lifeless. It took a couple of minutes to fetch the Melb.
bruiser round. Several know-alls yelled “ Schlenter 1 ”
but there was nothing crooked about it ; that punch
raised a lump as big as an egg and gave Atkinson a sore
head for the rest of the week. Mystery is how the coon
can hit so hard.

Monday night, at Metrop. A.C. (Sydney), Maori-
lander Otto Oribb will bump against something far
tougher than any he has yet met; to win, he must be in
tip-top trim. Melbourne Tot Higgins, a stoutly - built
clever two-handed fighter who leaves a mark where he
hits, provides the M.L. bruiser’s latest job. It will be a
tough go from “ Time! ” till one or other is knocked
limp, for they’re both fighters from Fightville. Tot’s
superior knowledge of the game will give him a big pull,
but O. Oribb takes a lot of killing and is always dangerous.
If writer is not much mistaken there’ll be more betting on
this mill than on any previous half-dozen and Oribb will
start favorite.

“Old Timer”: Novice tourneys as run in
Sydney should be styled handicaps, though those who
ought to get the starts generally give them. If an ex-
perienced eye can gauge weight, two recent so-called 8.7
affairs embraced list, (or pretty close thereto) men, while
the 9st. competition, commenced last week, included at
least one or two who might take a stone-and-a-half off and
still be outside limit. The old scales that wouldn’t budge
past a desired point if you put a ton on them must have
come to life again.

League cyclist Larry Corbett figured as a pug.
for the first time in a match with Ned Wylie, a Miller’s
Point coal-lumper, at Alhambra A.C. (Sydney) Monday
night. Both were in tip-top buckle. Wylie scaled pro-
bably 12st., while Corbett looked a stone heavier and a
ball of muscle ; he is of the Joe Goddard type in make
and methods. Wylie recalled Fitzsimmons somewhat—
without, of course, anything like the lathy-limbed Maori-
lander’s cleverness. 600 people looked on, crazed with
excitement from end to end of a wild, bashing battle
reminiscent of the days when grizzly Goddard used to
literally eat his man up. The pair would crash into each
other from opposite directions ; then the surrounding
space would be filled with arms and legs. Anon the two,
locked together, would struggle, wrestle, maul, and scram-
ble across the ring into the ropes—sometimes over them,
if a ring-post didn’t happen to bar the way. Then little
referee Tom Christian, about sft. sin. and 9st., would try
to separate the maddened giants. Once Wylie hooked
Corbett with the right, and down went the man that took
the starch out of plugger Bilmartin. Each was wrestled,
tripped, or flung to the boards at least a dozen times. It
was a go-as-you-please affair fought under Paddy’s Market
rules. Corbett went weak occasionally but pulled himself
together wonderfully—so did Wylie ; but neither shirked
his task. Somewhere in the sixth or seventh rounds
Corbett lost his head and sent a savage La Blanche swing
in the direction of the referee, just catching that gritty
individual on the ribs as he was jumping out of distance.
The eighth term was the last. They fought together
with the usual bang and were at work as fiercely as ever
when Wylie came away and cried enough ; his wrist was
dislocated. Corbett was then declared winner of one of
the toughest fights seen for many a day.
M.L. pug-freak Fitzsimmons now swears that
he was drugged in the fight with Jeffries, last June, for
the world’s championship. After the second round he
knew naught of what happened. His manager and
seconds support this statement, and explain that they
kept it back hitherto for fear of being charged with
making excuses and in the hope of getting a return-
match on. Published reports of the battle at the time
read very peculiarly ; one authority went so far as to say
that the auburn-headed one actually poked his jaw out in
the last round to stop a swing that wouldn’t have gone
within inches of him had he not done so. Then came the
information that a few days later he bought a theatre in
Chicago.

News by last Vancouver mail is that Peter
Jackson, the once-great colored boxer—the cleverest big
man the world ever saw—was at Victoria (B.O.) an abso-
lute wreck. He had been in the local hospital for months
at the point of death through the ravages of pneumonia,
and left that institution last December completely broken.
Report says that the prize-ring hero of a year or two
back, who made and frittered away thousands of dollars,
was destitute, and but for a few friends—strangers until
six months ago—in Victoria, he would have had to starve
or go to a benevolent asylum. Different people through-
out the States owe Peter big sums, but not a cent has
been forthcoming from, any. Writer knows that Bill
Corbett, who started and nurtured the one-time famous
York St. (Sydney) boxing club, and who was Jackson’s
friend when Jackson badly wanted a friend in Sydney-
before ever he dreamt of even local championship honors
—has been doing his utmost for a long time to get the big
gentlemanly black over to Sydney, where a congenial
position and ample opportunities for making a comfort-
able living await him.

Coincidence punters should have backed at least
two winners at Moorefield (Sydney) St. Patrick’s Day
meeting. Isa, the unbacked winner of the Gossoon

M. Harris, rider of Hector 11., at Moorefield

it really seemed hard that he should have been picked out
as scapegoat for so many Johnny Armstrongs. At least
one horse could have “ walked in,” had he been wanted,
but the stewards made no sign in that direction. All the
same, the public saw quite sufficient to make it keep an
eye upon that moke in the

Forest Lodge (Syd.) trot brought forth a great
set-to between Charley and Lettie, Lettie fairly wearing
the big horse down and winning on the post. The dis-
tance was supposed to be If mile, but Lettie’s time being
given as a 2min. 28sec. gait, is pretty good proof that the
alleged distance was not covered. If Forest Lodge Club
intends giving the trotters a show, it should have the
course surveyed and the proper distances marked out.

If the recent sale of Stand Off and Scorn to Mr.
M'Kenna means that they will soon be shipped to India
a good many punters will rejoice over the transaction.
Stand Off is, apparently, a poor finisher when tackled, and
Scorn —a Maribyrnong Plate winner—has been the most
delusive beast, bar Manfred, that ever carried W. R.
Wilson’s colors. The big son of Bill of Portland started
this season by winning a race in handsome style, after
Which he ran second for two events. Then came his
cowardly collapse in the Caulfield Cup race, followed by a
series of failures under diminishing weights. At the
recent V.R.O. meeting Scorn was handicapped among the
duffers, and ran like a pig. Yet he may do big things
under new management in another country. The possi-
bilities are in him.

The nasty, tricky practice of taking a horse into
the “ birdcage ” for the public to assume that it is there
on racing business, and then returning the animal to the
stables with its tongue in its cheek is quite commonly
adopted by owners (or trainers) nowadays. People not
unnaturally insinuate that these illegitimate visits to the
“ birdcage’” are intended to deceive. A likely winner of
the last race on the programme has its number left on the
board and its carcase visible on the ground until 4.30 p.m.
or thereabouts, when its number is removed from the board
and its body retires from view. Meanwhile the non-starter
has been backed many times with the men who
lay the double. “ This and the last ”is I key’s most fre-
quent invitation, and the fool who punts in “doubles”
finds that the candidate he selected for the “ last,”
on the strength of its presence in the birdcage, might just
as well have been in Ikey’s bag all the time. Racing
authorities should, in fairness to their many-headed
patrons, insist upon the early scratching of any birdcaged
gee-gee which is not intended for any race during the
afternoon. This would meet the case, of the owner who
pleads that he is merely trying to get his non-starter
“ used to a crowd.”

Steve Callinan, the premier N.S.W. jockey,
has already 32 wins to his credit for the current racing
season. During the fortnight ended Saturday, 17th
March, he had no less than nine wins out of 13 mounts.
This record is all the more astonishing from the fact that
he landed successive doubles at Randwick, Maitland,
Warwick Farm, and Dapto.

Many thoroughbreds Transvaaled by M.L. con-
tingenters were to be raced or sold after the public-pic-
nic? When rough-riders were ordered out, however, and
some had secured blue-blooded top-notchers, a Ministerial
bomb burst in camp. Premier Seddon coolly ordained
that all nags (including those privately owned) were to
become the property of Govt, after the war. The result-
ant remarks would have made a seasoned trooper blush ;
and mediocre mokes were at once substituted for the
flash and fiery Carbines.

A torpedo-whiskered warrior, eager for a crim-

accepted, but had to find a horse. In desperation he
went to the races to replenish or bust. Planked £4 on a
horse in the Welter because it bore the name of his hash-
foundry, and the outsider duly rolled in and paid £32 for
each £l. Next day he married a laundry nymph and
bought a lingerie-cleansing biz. from a Chinaman. A

but romped in on the next, and the stewards passed him
out for 12 months for inconsistency.

On the burning subject of re-mounts for Boer-
hunters, a Mr. Higgisson, ex-manager of the Natal Stud
Co., lately wrote to the Times suggesting that horses
should be got from Australia rather than from England,
Ireland, or South America. At the same time, this Mr.
H., who ought to be an authority, insisted that it would be
possible for the British Army agents to buy lots of horses
in South Africa if they knew the ropes. Apparently the
sturdiest of imported nags, from Australia or anywhere
else, can’t compare with the Boer pony for usefulness in
African war work. Young Lieut. Roberts, of the Vic.
Contingent (now among the killed) gave a great account
of a weedy Arab-blooded animal he had bought—or
“ found ” —at a Boer farm. “ I rode him all one day with
17st. on, and he was as game as could be at the finish. In
the next two days he did about 25 miles and then 40
miles, and was still very willing.” The excellence of the
local gee-gee was one of the many things which the
British “ Intelligence ” Dept, knew nothing about —until
the Boers’ “ extraordinary mobility ” had made it pain-
fully palpable.
“A.M.MeC.”: Re N.S.W. cricket know-alls
prophesying about Worrall, Jones and Howell (“ Bails,”
8., 3/3/’00). Jones was certainly slower this year though
with the last Aust. XI. (especially against the crack) he
had magnificent pace and devil. But, having taken such
a strong pull at himself in England it was natural that he
should let himself go a bit when the business part of the
tour was over. Result —fat inside, and want of staying
power. Nevertheless he was on the improve every match
during the season. As for Worrall, he was at the top in
England, where the wickets certainly suited him, and
played in a few interprovincials this season without any
practice (and he needs a lot) and an injured knee. He
considers that he has not yet reached his prime. Howell,
after the winter’s spell, might regain spin and break.
Carter is a fAir all-round cricketer, good field, forcing
bat, and—very moderate—medium-paced bowler.

Major-General Macdonald ordered his pipers to play
over the last six miles to Bloemfontein. There are now
no armed Boers in the neighborhood.
With Lord Roberts’ entry into Bloem-
fontein and the disbandment and disarming of a
large proportion of the Free State forces another
big step has been made towards the end of the
war. Of course, in the event of Kruger and
Joubert continuing the struggle, which they
will probably do, there may yet be some des-
perate fighting which, considering the sizes of the
opposing forces, can only end one way. The
beginning of the siege of Pretoria now seems to be
within easily-measurable distance. If the city is
as well armed and provisioned as has been repre-
sented its reduction, in the event of a serious
defence being made, would be a severe task.
Melbourne Tramway Co., apparently con-
vinced of the error of its ways, or desiring future
concessions, or fearing a possible appeal to the
Supreme Court —which appeal might result' in a
severe shock to its pocket—has at last yielded the
eight-hour day to its conductors and gripmen with
as much grace as it could muster. The men will
probably have to work irregular hours, possibly
ten or more a day, but the co. promises to pay
them time-and-a-quarter for all time over eight
hours per day, and also to so arrange the time-
tables that every man shall have at least one day
off in seven. And if the dividend-grinding mono-
poly had had the sense to do this a year ago in-
stead of prating largely and mendaciously about
its tremendous responsibilities and the many
thousands a year it would lose by this arrange-
ment, it would have saved a lot of bother and got
itself much less disliked.

The Boer makes a carious departure from
the weary Presbyterianism of his religion. Unlike
his Scotch prototype, he is fond of the theatre and
takes advantage of every opportunity for histri-
onic entertainment. True, the Boer has rightly
the name for never encouraging any pleasure that
he cannot see mentioned in the Bible. But if he
wants to do anything very badly he simply doesn’t
look in the Bible and then he cannot tell whether
it is mentioned or not. When the Boer woman
marries she hides her hair beneath a close cap, and
considers it a gross impropriety to let it be seen
again. The Hebrews had the same notion. The
Anglo-Saxon woman’s hair was cut short on her
wedding morn, the sentence in later generations
being commuted to penal servitude for life in a
cap. A faint survival of this is seen in the modem
custom whereby a girl arriving at marriageable
age transforms her flowing mane into the door-
knob style.
A Melbourne crowd was delighted with a
cheerful little contretemps in Swanston-street one
recent afternoon. First there was a clamor of
tongues, then a vision of a wild Irishwoman tow-
ing a feeble drunk out of a pub. by his long red
whiskers and the crowd closed in upon them ; but
by this time the woman had collared the first
passer, a stout, immaculate citizen in a long hand-
some Parisian hat and a quantity of beautiful
clothes—a conspicuous figure on ’Change—and
was hanging on to him with all her claws, inviting
sympathy and moral support. “ Has he dthe
roight to be dthrinkin’ ivery penny he arns ? Tell
me that ? Is it dacent fer a clane married man to
be dthrinkin’ wid anny won but his lawful woife ?
It ain’t, an’ ye know it.” The heavy swell en-
deavored to shake off the indignant matron, but
she clung like an octopus, nodding vigorously at
her husband, who stood by, grinning stupidly,
awaiting the verdict. “ Would a man trate
a woman so if he was half a man ? ” squealed
the woman. “ Would he, sor ? Would he ? ” The
stout gentleman appealed to her better nature,
and called her his good woman, and became red as
bricks and possessed with tribulation. “Tell him
he’s a dirthy schoundril. Tell him it tell
him it, sor ! Tell him it to the dirthy face av
him ! ” “My good woman,” pleaded the respect-
able person, “ really I—you know this is no
business of mine. I—eh don’t you know I ”
Bit at this stage the drunken husband took a
fresh -view of the situation, and lurching over he
said softly : “ Washa mane by caressin’ me woife
in the public strate?” and he hit the broker a
terrible belt on his sinless and stainless Paris hat,
at which crisis a Heaven-sent policeman drove
through the crowd and broke up an altogether
delightful little party, whilst the important citizen
carried his battered tile to the nearest hatter.
A mocking Cornishman writes to The
Bulletin from Melbourne :
St. Patrick flourished amazingly in Melbourne on the
17th under the patronage of Her Majesty. Every man in
the city who had not the shamrock in his buttonhole had
a bit of green in his eye, but over all the crowd, the grand
procession, and the multitude of banners was the depres-
sing sense of an ignoble peace. The march past, the
assemblage in the street, all were characterised by an
atmosphere of sobriety and propriety and a decorum
that had something pathetic it it. The Queen’s
recognition of St. Pat. cast a glamor of loyalty
about the show, and even the truculence that usually
gleams in the eye of the rugged Mick in the green sash
was conspicuous by its absence—displaced by a glow of
abject benevolence of which the procesher was obviously
more than half ashamed. It was the biggest turnout the
Hibernian heads and bodies have had in Melbourne, but
in conferring loyal respectability upon the event, Victoria
was guilty of another injustice to Ireland. The
silence of the procession was quite oppressive after
the Contingent razzle, and the profound calm was
adversely commented upon by contemptuous “ Barks ” in
the crowd. “’Tis jist loike tryin’ to get dthrunk on
praties an’ buthermilk,” said one sad old man. But the
most touching sight of the day was seen at the inter-
section of Swanston and Bourke-st., where a man in a
vellow cart and wearing a yellow coat stood waiting for
the procession to pass. Perhaps it was a mere coincidence
that he was driving a yellow horse, and that a yellow
dog sat insolently on the seat beside him; but
the fact that he was sucking an orange must have
been a premeditated insult: A young man, apparently
from Bungaree way, pointed the yellow apparition
out to his aged mother. “An’ sorra a man wid pride
enough to raise a han’ to him ! ” said the crone, heart-
brokenly. It was a sad day for Ireland entirely.
I can vouch for the foregoing, but the following is mere
hearsay, intended to illustrate the effect of the loyalty
epidemic even upon the Irish mind. ’Tis reported that a
bit of a ruction “ wid plentiful sticks in it ” happened
incidentally in the Exhibition grounds, and it had as-
sumed the shape of a writhing cone of men w'hen Hegan,
or Hogan, or Hourigan arrived—the victim was under-
neath. “ Saints be praised !” said Hegan, or Hogan, or
Hourigan sweetly. “Is it an Orangeman ye have
there?” “An Orangeman?” was the scornful re-
ply. “Divil a won—it’s a. I-lomeruler ! ” The
City was strewn with drunks at night, but they
were drunks without heart and interest, desolate drunks
who recognised the utter folly of expecting to find any-
where a man who would venture to “ trid on the tails of
their coats,” even by way of kindness/ Nobody heard a
fight asked for from morning to midnight, and to
declare the day to have been “ a grand success ” under
the circumstances is to give the lie to the Celtic character.
Writer remembers seeing two Irishmen part at a pub.
door in Ballarat one St. Patrick’s night, years ago. Both
were shockingly battered. They had hammered each
other all day,/and drunk together like brothers dear all
night. They shook hands. “ Pether Ryan,” said one
through oblique and bloated lips, “ I have to tank ye for
a very pleasant day.” Never a man of them in Melbourne
could thank anyone for a pleasant day last Saturnight.
“ Old Soldier ” :
What’s Chamberlain’s little game with that new Bush
Contingent of his ? The other day an Australian Oontin-
genter’s letter published in the papers stated that anyone
in S. Africa who could ride and shoot could get as much
fighting as he wanted at 10s. a day by joining one of the
local corps of scouts. Chamberlain offers the 2000 Aus-
tralians he seeks a modest ss. a day as the maximum
—just half the rate, it would appear, they are paying the
Cape men.

was occupied by Free State troops. It was
evening when the Boers, under the command, of
President Steyn’s brother, entered the town.
There were not many British or loyalists there, but
what there were expected that their belongings
would be confiscated next day, and they determined
to try and spoil the Egyptians while they had the
chance. They were personally acquainted with
the Boer leaders and proposed a friendly game at
poker. The Dutchmen accepted and the game
became fast and furious, and went merrily on till
the morning came with a rush and suggested that it
was time to pay up. Then they compared accounts
and the Boers grasped the fact that they had been
cleaned out. Also, the Britishers demanded that
the winnings be paid over in gold. The Boers re-
luctantly paid over. A field-cornet suggested that
they should commandeer the winnings for the
Boer patriotic fund, but Commandant Steyn and
his Lieutenant wouldn’t hear of it and allowed thef
Britishers to depart with their loot in peace.
The Bulletin rises to gratefully acknow-
ledge the receipt of the 31st edition of “The
Australian Handbook ” from Messrs. Gordon and
Gotch, the publishers. This is about the most
comprehensive and reliable fund of information
about Australia in existence in one volume. The
statistics have been carefully brought up to date,
in many cases with the assistance of Govt. Statis-
ticians. In addition to about 80 pp. of English
statistics and general information, descriptions
are given of every town in Australasia, giving the
number of banks, stores, clubs, churches, and pub-
lic-houses. There are tables of all sorts of Australian
statistics, a vast mass of geographical information,
with maps, and full information how to get from
any part of the continent to another, or away from
it altogether, and rates of passage by various lines
of steamers to various parts of the planet. A his-
torical account of each province is given, with a
full list of its resources and possibilities. And, in
fact, there is no need to travel now-a-days to know
Australia. The best way to know all about this
great thirsty island, and the territories adjacent
thereto, is to take the pet-lamb down the harbor
and smoke and fish while she reads the Australian
Handbook aloud—after that is digested, there is
nothing more to learn.*

last Saturday, when the bowlers had all the best of the
deal. The biggest score of the day was made by South
Sydney who scored against Paddington 202 for 9 wickets —
due to the batting of 0. Gregory (93), and Pite (47). These
two ran up 99 before a wicket fell. The tail then melted
before Noble, who took 6of the 7 last wickets. Central
Cumberland disposed of E. Sydney for 141 and lost 2
wickets for 86, which looks as if its chance for the
season’s championship is assured. C.O. has discovered a
new bowler in Woods, a Blacktown man. He is a medium-
paced left-hander, and on Saturday took 3 wickets for 13
runs.

In a recent cricket-match, Fitzroy v. Carlton,
the former made 251 in first innings. Carlton batted the
following Saturday on a wet wicket and scored 80. Fitz-
roy then went to the wicket and when one over was
bowled declared the innings closed and sent Carlton in
for second innings on a bowler’s wicket. Result : all
out for 13, including 6 byes. There were 9 “ ducks.”
Mitchell, Fitzroy captain, took 6 wickets for 2 runs. Runs
made off bat totalled 7. The Fitzroy captain is very
proud of his master stroke of policy.

Late news is that another Australian champion
has been snared by the Motherland. Top-rung swimmer
Fred Lane is not coming back again—at least, for a year
or two ; they’ve given him a good billet in a London soft-
goods house. During his residence “down under” Lane
has given many exhibition swims, put up a world’s record,
appropriated ten first and three seconds, and only been
unplaced once.
* * * *
The deterioration of swimming in Victoria is
evidenced by the fact that A. J. Pearson (last Sat.) appro-
priated the 100yds. championship at Middle Park Baths
in 1.16}. Fifteen years ago, Walter M’lndoe of same
province put up 1.4 for the distance. Compare Pearson’s
performance with Craig’s (N.S.W) 1.3, Lane’s (N.S.W.)
1.3 2-5 and Bishop’s (N.S.W.) 1.1 3-5 straightway. There
are at least 50 schoolboys in the mother province who
could do better than 1.16}.

A big muster of Sydney rowing and sailing men
decided last week to hold a “ gigantic regatta ” in Sydney
Harbor on Jan. 26 next—the first Anniversary Day of the
new century. The giving of big prize money for all classes
of contests is contemplated and other provinces are to be
asked to participate. The Govt, will be approached for
assistance. It is likely that the function may extend over
two days.

The three crack Sydney 22-footers had an old-
time black North-Easter for their Sweepstake last Satur-
day, when the Effie and her skipper (Nick Johnson) once
again proved their right to the championship. Effie
mounted a small suit, and had a comfortable sail, whilst
the Keriki and Plover carried their big sails, and it took
their crews all they knew to keep them out of the
“ gutter."

Latest negotiations at ’Ome between Hunter
River (N.S.W.) and Shoalhaven (N.S.W.) scullers Towns
and Wray respectively for a match, including the cham-
pionship of England and temporary ownership of London
Sportsman Cup, is that Wray, having threatened to claim
the title if Towns didn’t meet him on the Tyne, latter
posted £5O to bind a match for decision in May or June,
agreeing to leave the question of venue to the donors of
the Gup. If Wray means business there should be no
further talk.

Retired world’s champion Bill Beach has caught
the craze and affects a wheel. Rumor credits him with
having designs on the next “ Austral.” Questioned on
the subject, William of Dapto shakes his head and says
“it’s only for exercise.” But an old-buffers’ race with a
fat money-prize hanging thereto might bring about a
combination of exercise and biz.

N.S.W. League’s three night cycle-meetings
concluded Wednesday last week. Attendance was again
big. Paced races (run on pursuit plan so as to preclude
the necessity of one man riding on the outside of the
track) were exciting. Jackson (V.) and Walne (Q.) met in
the first heat when former clearly evidenced that he is the
best paced rider in the province. Walne got away at a
great bat and was in front throughout the initial mile but
thence on Jackson never gave him a hope. At 3 miles
the Bananalander’s pace went back on him and Jackson
finished solus, negotiating 18 laps (about 4} miles) in the
lOmin. allowed. McDonald (W.A.) annexed the second
heat from Morgan (V.) whose tandem failed two or three
times, but enough was seen to indicate that had it not
been for this happening the southern province’s rep. must
have won. The motor having gone bung Jackson and
McDonald (the two left in) agreed to go a mile against
■time to decide the destination of first money. Jackson
tried first and got home in 1.41 3-5. McDonald’s essay
■occupied 1.43 2-5.

S.A. Cycling League opens the fine new track
on Adelaide Oval this Saturday, with a big programme in-
cluding Walne, Jackson, Forbes, Middleton, and Roberts.
The biggest draw of all in Adelaide is Bill Martin, but he
has had a misunderstanding with the Sheriff about a
recognizance, and prefers to stay away. Bill’s cordial
hatred of Adelaide cycling officials always provided
excitement in the past', and the public regret that Martin

Sub-committee of N.S.W. A.A.A. told off to
probe charges of crooked running and betting made
against lilywhite amateurs has submitted its report,
which clearly indicates that there was more make-believe
than anything else about the enquiry. “ There has been
betting, but to no great extent, and only at mixed meet-
ings, where bookmakers were present,” saith the commit-
tee. The report doesn’t say whether amateurs themselves
affected book and pencil for the nonce (which is alleged)
to gather in their fellow amateurs’ cash, or whether the
leviathans of Tatt.’s came out to do it. “It is clear,”
says the committee, “ that non-trying is confined to a
very small section of the runners, and that these runners
are not on the increase.” Since when does “ not on the
increase ” date ? and is it not a fact that a prominent
official of the A.A.A. recently threw off his allegiance
because of the glaring manner in which this crooked run-
ning and betting were being indulged in ? So little are
these offences in evidence that the committee feels called
upon to invoke the aid of the Govt, and the various
ground authorities in eradicating Ikey ; also, it recom-
mends that a meeting of all athletic organisations be held
to devise ways and means with a view to crushing book-
making and betting at sports generally—and all because
the betting is “to no great exueiit.” A nice fuss to make
over nothing !

Cable news weeks since anent shooting for
Grand Prix du Casino at Monte Carlo was scant and not
quite correct. ■ Australian champion Mackintosh and
“Count O’Brien,” a Spanish sport, divided firpt and
second moneys (about £1300), and then went on for the
trophy. “Failing light” doesn’t seem to have entered
into the matter at all. The Count killed 18 to Mackin-
tosh’s 17 out of 20, and won. Grand Prix du Casino was
started 29 years ago, and during that period English
shots have won 11 times, Italians 8, French 3, Austro-
Hungarians 3, Belgian twice, American once, and Spanish
once.
Latest files give details of pigeon-shooting con-
test for Grand Prix de Monte Carlo last month. Aus-
tralian Mr. Mackintosh (30J metres), Baron de Tavernost
(21J), Signor Galleti (25i), and Mr. Southby Hewitt (23)
whacked the money (8890 fr.) for the four places; after
grassing seven birds each, and shot on for the gold
medal. All four killed the eighth, but Galleti and the
man with the double-barrelled name missed their ninth,
leaving the issue between the Australian and the Belgian
(Tavernost). Both brought their tenth birds down, but
Mackintosh’s eleventh got away hard-hit, and the Baron
secured the prize. Tavernost, though shooting at Monte
Carlo for years past, never won a leading event before.


There are a lot of curious, and mostly ridi-
culous, stories about Kitchener and his appoint-
ment as Chief-of-Staff. One was that he applied
to be allowed to go as Commander-in-Chief, and
when Wolseley approached Lansdowne with the
proposal that he should be sent, the war-god
started up in dismay and said, “ Good heavens !
we can’t send him ; he’d come back with Kruger’s
head in his hat-box!” “What odds?” said
Wolseley. But Lansdowne was obdurate, and
Kitchener was politely told that there were so
many senior officers who really must have a chance,
etc. Another was that after this rebuff he re-
ceived the message appointing him as Chief-of-
StafE, and wired back that he would only accept
the appointment on one condition, namely, that
he could hang any man in South Africa. This
time Lansdowne reluctantly telegraphed carte
blanche with regard to hanging. Lansdowne is
said to be convinced that Kitchener wants
Kruger’s head to adorn the dining-room wall
opposite to the head of the Mahdi. Anyhow,
when Kitchener got to Capetown he did good
work by rooting round the best hotels and
getting medical reports on all the officers who
were invaliding among fast women and cham-
pagne, and packing them off to the front.
Ruskin had part of his upper lip cut away
by the bite of a dog, in youth. He said ; “ I
would give the Modern Painters for a new
profile.” This was almost as much a grievance to
him as the club foot to Byron.
Sydney is decorated with two “silver-
tongued” Yankee orators, etc., etc., now—the
permanent Consul Bell and the temporary lecturer
Bell. J udging from descriptions there must be a
considerable amount of silver-tongued rivalry
between them. It was lecturer Bell who said the
other night that “a great deal was heard about
fallen women, but he wanted to say that for every
fallen woman there was a fallen man somewhere.”

EVERYTHING FAILS EXCEPT
CLEMENTS TONIC-
Another Unbounded Proof.
-A. POSITIVE UTEST GER-POST FOR OTHER SUFFERERS
The Case of
foIISS RHODA IVfcGUIRE.
(Reported for the “ Star. 1 ')
Miss Rhoda McGuire resides at 123
Bourke-street, Darlinghurst. A reporter
was despatched to see her, and he was
fortunate in finding the lady at home. In
answer to an interrogation as to the
truth of a report that had reached him
from Nyngan : —“ That she, Miss McGuire,
was one of the lucky many who had been
saved from fearful pain and continued
suffering by the timely use of Clements
Tonic,” Miss McGuire said: —“That is
quite true. I have unbounded proof of the
value of Clements Tonic, for when I was ill
I tried I do not know liow many so-called
remedies, and nothing did, any lasting
good but Clements Tonic.”
.“ Would you please tell iwe how your
illness began?” enquired the reporter.
-“I have never been very strong,”
answered Miss McGuire, “and four years
ago I received a most serious nervous shock,
so serious that it appeared to upset my
entire nervous system and derange the
normal functions of my body. I became so
agitated and shaken with unknown fears
that I was frightened to leave the house
even in the day time. A feeling of
mysterious trouble continually oppressed
me. A sudden noise would make me start
with trembling fear and nearly drive me
mad. v. Solitude was unbearable ; I would
not have stopped alone even in my own
Lome on any consideration; I dare not.
All the brightness in my life seemed
darkened, my mind passing unceasingly
from one dismal thought to another; and,
finally, I reached that point of despair that
life did not seem to me worth living, and I
truly believe that had it not been for my
religious training and my fear of the world
to come, I should have committed suicide.
Frequently I was a victim to fits of hysteria ;
at other times I would sit crying over my
work for half the day together. Joined
with this mental collapse were agonising
physical pains. My head was a delirium
and full of screeching noises, and when I
went to bed or tried to rest it would be
awful. I had sharp, frequent neuralgic
pains darting about my face. They would
commence on the right cheek-bone, and from
there spread upwards and downwards to
the forehead and the neck. My nerves
would throb so and I became so terribly
agitated that at times I could not put a foot
to the ground. 1 noticed that the faceache
increased in intensity at night time and
during the hot weather, and these attacks
would endure from three days to as long a
time as six weeks. Then I had intermittent,
stabbing pains in the back, under the left
shoulder ; and after my meals I suffered
from distressing indigestion, a feeling of
weight, oppression, and tightness across the
chest, and often the food would rise in my
throat or be brought up again. This want
of nourishment further helped to weaken
my debilitated system. 1 was a burden to
myself, fit for nothing. In the latter days
of my sickness my heart began to trouble
me by loud palpitation.” .. j
“Surely, Miss McGuire,” enquired the
reporter, “ you did not let yourself get so
bad by neglect ? ”
“ No, I tried all sorts of pills and prepara-
tions, and all without benefit. I had lost all
hope, and was sure I should never get better,
when a friend of mine strongly advised me
to take Clements Tonic, because she had
herself seen its wonderful curative power in
her own family. So strongly did she
persuade me that I try it. The
chemist was very reluctant to give ire what
I asked for, enquiring my symptoms, and
then assuring me that a nerve tonic of his
own compounding would be far better and
more suited to my case ; but I remembered
my friend’s assurance, and would have
nothing else but Clements Tonic—[Wise
girl ! he only wanted to sell you something
on which he got more profit—therefore
cheaper—therefore inferior. — Ed.] — and it
was well for me that I did. Eor even that
first bottle did me a world of good. It
seemed to act like a concentrated food, and
to nourish my debilitated system. At the
same time it gave strength to my disordered
nerves, and built and braced me up all over.
My fits of hysteria were banished, the fear-
ful depression and melancholy mind passed
away. I was no longer afraid to go out or
to be left alone. The neuralgic .pains in the
face and the screeching noises in the head
troubled me no more. My digestion
steadily improved, my meals remained in
my stomach, and '/ere not followed by the
heavy, oppressive feeling in the chest. The
pains under the left shoulder ceased to
trouble me, and in all respects my general
health took a wondrous turn for the better.!
I was in every sense a new woman. And T
am quite sure that this revolution in my
deplorable plight was all owing to Clements*
Tonic. I never weary of telling every one
so and trying to persuade others who are
sick to try it. You are at liberty to publish
what I say in any way you like if you think
it will be of use ; but it seems to me so'
many persons have tried and proved the
undoubted value of Clements Tonic that.:
what I have said must be merely an echo of
an oft repeated tale. ”

which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know

The cable announced the other day
that Roberts’ forces had advanced on Cronje
“by the sap.” Reads like an ancient history,
when a French army under Vauban was be-
sieging Namur 200 years ago. Their guns knocked
a hole in one of the outworks and a prince of the
blood was sent up to get the glory of taking the
place. The prince said the breach must be stormed
—after the style of Buller, Methuen and Co.
Vauban said that would cost many lives whereas
he, V., could do the trick without loss. The
prince had his way, and the assault failed, with
the loss of 700 men. Then Vauban had his way,
and in two days had taken the work “ by the sap”
with the loss of one man. “ The sap ”is simply a
ditch, the earth from which is thrown out on each
side, the men digging it being sheltered in their
advance by a roller 6ft. in diameter, which they
push before them towards the point of attack.
They are quite safe from bullets, and nothing over
which they can push their roller can stop them.
Vauban has the credit of the invention, but the
Turks used a kind of sap 200 years before his time.

RUPTURE.
ã
Extracts from a few of the
many grateful letters in
praise of “ Dr. Pierce’s Mag-
netic Elastic Truss,” re-
ceived during the year 1899:
RUPTURE CURED.—
“ The Truss I received from
you in August, 1898, has
cured me of my rupture, so
that I can do any work with-
out the Truss now.” G.
TURNER, Felsham, Suffolk,
September 16,1899.
RUPTURE CURED.—“I
received your Truss at the
beginning of Augnst, and am
glad to say that, by the
blessing of God, it has cured
my rupture in rather less
than two months. I was
told that rupture could be
cured only by an operation,
but in two months I was
cured of that which had
been a terrible worry to me
for over two years.”—A. R.
STOYL E, Banjoewangle,
Java, November 29, 1899.
RUPTURE CURED—“I
commenced to wear your
Truss, May, ’9B, and kept on
till Christmas. It is now
Feb. 13, 1899, and I have felt
nothing of the rupture since.
I had been ruptured for 20
years, and had worn steel
trusses, but had to give
them up, not receiving any
benefit from them, and
thinking my case hopeless.”
—T. W. CHAPMAN, Rams-
gate.
RUPTURE CURED.—“I
have given the Truss a good
trial, and am pleased to say
it has cured me, as I have
not had it on now in five
weeks. I was down on your
Truss when I sent for it; but
it is the best Truss money
can buy, and I do not know
how to thank you for the
good is has done me.” —
JAMES GUEST, 3 Willow
Place, Leeds, Yorks.
RUPTURE CURED.—“I
have recommended Dr.
Pierce’s Truss to everyone
that I know is ruptured, and
tell all what good it has done
me, for I have now left off
my truss these four months.
It made a man of me, for no
matter how hard I work the
rupture never comes down.”
I —D. HURCOMBE, Pill
Point, Milford Haven, South
Wales.
RUPTURE CURED.—“ I
had a Double ‘ B.’ Magnetic
Elastic Truss from you some
years ago, which cured the
Rupture on the right side in
a few months—a rupture
of thirty years’ standing.”
j GEORGE BYRNE, Supt.
Lighthouse, Double Island
Point, Queensland, Australia.
RUPTURE RELIEVED.—
“lam thankful to tell you I
have not had any pain what-
ever since wearing your
Truss. Have never had a
truss to equal it for ease and comfort, and can truly say
it has done me more good than I ever thought pos-
sible.”—EMlLY ARNOLD, 1 Sedan Cottages, Dorchester-
road, Weymouth.

“ Melb." : Demise, Oircusman Harry Burton. He had
to die in Ooppin’s Home—an unfortunate end for an in-
dustrious, sober, and strictly honorable man, after a long
and hard-working life, throughout most of which he was
a prosperous manager. He started his National Circus in
1851, and mostly kept to Victoria, where he was familiar
everywhere, except, strange to say, in Melbourne. It
was thought that when he settled in his hotel at Redbank
he had become comfortably fixed up. Surely it was a nice
little business, and speculation must have brought him
down. One thing : Poor Burton, when prosperous, did
much for the retreat in which he was destined to breathe
his last.
“Si”: Dampier’s Hamlet is a most elusive personage ;
you never know when you have got him ; his “ antic dis-
positions ” are too numerous altogether, and in the end
you feel that you have been sitting at the feet of 15 garrul-
ous people instead of at those of one royal mattoid. Another
fault of A.D.’s is his trick of rushing into inarticulation
when the Prince’s emotions become too many for him.
Dampier fails too in his effort to give verisimilitude to the
scene in which he conjures Ophelia to go nunning. The
in-and-out business of this passage beats most actors, and
the more one sees it acted the more convinced one becomes
that it shouldn’t be acted that way at all. And the grave-
yard scene with the two braggarts whooping over Ophelia’s
poor clay, how it jars ! Hamlet, like most of Shake-
speare’s heroes, is terribly afflicted with the orator’s itch,
and will be talking though the heavens fall. He would
have been a politician in our time. Action must be de-
layed, situations spoilt, and a stageful of people con-
verted into sticks in order that he may philosophise at
large in massive language, and often with amazing irre-
levance. For this reason amongst others Hamlet can
only be satisfactorily interpreted by a singularly striking
personality, instinct with true genius. Probably the
eccentric Dane never has been satisfactorily interpreted.
This to console Alfred Dampier.
Miss Nance O’Neil’s favorite attitude in “The Jewess,”
cursing, with both hands up, raises a suspicion that that
charming lady is knock-kneed in the right arm.
Melbournites have been rolling-up enthusiastically to
the Empire Exhibition, in the old Opera House. A
brass band outside in the corridor playing “Sons of the
Sea,” and, inside, one of “the boys of the bull-
dog breed,” a blue-jacket from “ the Cerberus,” who ex-
plains the mechanism of the Nordenfeldt gun to admiring
visitors in a thick German brogue. This sturdy Britisher’s
name is Carl Emil Googenheimer, or words to that effect.
London is a sweet city to sing-in during the winter
months. Nellie Stewart had to finally retire from the
Drury Lane panto, after three or four weeks of struggling
against ill-health. Then her understudy, Miss Molly
Lowell, lost her voice through an attack of influenza, and
Violet Cameron was permanently engaged for the princi-
pal boy part. Fair Violet is said to be less enchanting
than she was in the days when her friend Lord Lonsdale
disturbed her husband’s peace of mind.
Lily Dampier is quite the portliest Portia in the writer’s
recollection, and so strikingly Jewish in type that her
treatment of poor Shylock seems absolutely unnatural.
“ R.W.S.” : Went to see Henry Vee at Her Majesty’s
the other night, and when something went wrong with
the limelight I distinctly heard that monarch observe :
“ Damn you !—turn the light on me 1 ” Only time I have
heard Rignold curse.
“ S.” : Some high authorities say Shakespeare should be
acted without the rich dresses and scenic splendours of
up-to-date mountings, because extraneous magnificence
distracts the mind from the literary material of the bard.
Had an opportunity of sampling the other extreme
recently and found poor scenery and poor dresses abso-
lutely destructive to the interest. William S. deals largely
with the nobility and gentry, and when these people swell
round in shabby hose and hand-me-down doublet, and
present the appearance of having just been liberated by
Mosenstein at the sign of the three spheres round the
corner, it is hard to take either actors or author seriously.
To my mind exquisite dressing and elegant performers
and appointments are necessary to Shakespearean repre-
sentations, and so E. A. Abbey is the only man who has
staged Shakesbacon to my satisfaction.
A young man who has “ got it very bad ” “I am in-
spired to gush about a divine dancer in Williamson’s
Ballet Champetre, a fluffy vision with a haunting smile
that is persistent but never wearisome. The danseuse
who can smile and smile without cloying is deserving of
special mention, the average ballet-smile invariably
degenerating into a stitched grin early in the second act,
and dragging at the ears of the coryphee like a stark
criminal suspended in chains. It is the smile of rapt
Bacchante that glows and sparkles in the delectable face
of this inspired kicker, but it is her dancing that makes
her adorable, although she frolics with the ruck and has
not yet been ‘ discovered ’ for solo purposes. You have
seen dipping willow wands over sweet waters suddenly go
dancing with the gallant and vagrant wind, blow into
delectable curves, sway with a passionate languor that
suggests, strangely enough, old Asia, and flame-like
brunettes, and hasheesh, throw up their slender lines
with a sudden ecstacy and a shimmer of silver-and-green
draperies. That is how it is with the front row darling of
the Ballet Champetre. She does not dance merely, she
flows ; and watching the girl you dream that the melody
is a breeze of spring, blowing her lithe limbs into curves
of grace and rhythmic poses, and feel that at length,
after the failure of 900 bards, Spring has found her ade-
quate expression and her true embodiment."
After much negotiation, Rickards has now signed for a
three-years’dease of Adelaide Bijou, which will be re-
modelled and opened by a Tivoli co. in June. Stated that
Marcus will manage.
“Parisina”: The Theatre Francais, the burning of
which is cabled, was a played-out institution. Three
things, within the past 20 years, have been enough to
“cook” it : the withdrawal of Bernhardt, that of
Coquelin, and the production of Cyrano de Bergerac at
another theatre. The House of Molibre can no longer
claim to lead the stage, under these circumstances. The
performances are hardly ever the best things in Paris. Le
Bargy, its best jeune premier, left recently. Mdlle.
Bartet, the leading tragedienne, is of course good, but a
moon to the sun compared with Sarah. Rejane, the best
French comedienne, does not appertain to the Francais.
Its only great performer is Mounet-Sully, the tragedian,
who heads the stage in his line.
“Haresfoot”: The Premiere of “Little Red Riding
Hood,” Melb. Princess’s, satisfied me that I was looking on
the worst ramshackle literary haystack of a pantomime
ever put together. Yet the farrago of spectacle enter-
tained me, and I did not grudge an expensive place.
After Marcus Clarke’s pantomime, at the Theatre Royal,
“ Goody Two Shoes,” I said to him, “ How can a man of
your ability hammer together such a lot of weatherboards
as that ? ” With his little stutter, he replied, “ It’s not
mine—it’s G-Greville’s.” The low-comedians, as a rule,
are the author’s deadliest foes.
Musgrove Midas. The farewell banquet given, at the
Hotel Cecil, London, to the “ Belle of New York ” co., by
Geo. Musgrove—who has bought a splendid residence at
Kingston Vale—must have cost quite £5OO. There were
nearly 200 people present. All the male principals of the
co. received solid gold cigarette-cases. The chief ladies
of the caste were presented with handsome solid silver
writing-cases, and the chorus demoiselles were made
happy with gold chain bracelets. In his speech, Mr. Mus-
grove said he had not, as rumored, taken the piece off
from pique, but because he was convinced the public was
tired of it.
“Spudz”:The octogenarian Coppin is about due for
another “vitality” par. Writing from his Richmond
(Melb.) home to the Aaaus, he mentions that he had
rented Sorrento Athenaeum for the Indian Famine and
War Fund show on Easter eve, but as the latter fund was
big enough he would transfer proceeds to local charities
with reserve for Indian Famine; also would assist with
“ some of my popular chants,” and appear “ in character
to address the Empire army in a dramatic war-song.”
Asks “ co-operation of attractive artists.” Ye Ancient
Play-Actor still travels between his Melb. and Sorrento
homes, and is still driven by his daughter through the
streets in the perennial trap.
Emily Soldene narrates that a foreign prima-donna once
obliged her by appearing for her benefit in London.
After the show, Emily went to the dressing-room of the
prima-donna to thank her. The donna was clad in only
one garment. A cabman came in to take away her box.
The squeamish Emily protested. “ Oh,” said the donna,
“ what does it signify ? ” pointing out the box to the man
with her bare feet. Mdlle. Perretti, premiere danseuse at
the Alhambra, told Emily that she had a bath of hot milk
every morning, which gave her a matchless skin. All her
coilet-ware was silver. She died while engaged at a low
dancing saloon in Marseilles. One night Miss Soldene was
invited into the greenroom of London Gaiety to see a
“ Royal baby.” Sixpence per head was charged.
Martin Harvey, who made such a London hit with “The
uly Way,” began as a utility man in Irving's production
of “ Much Ado About Nothing." Ham that a little page,
in red, used to chaff him behind the scenes, and quiz his
taste in mediaoval costume. He married her. They were
travelling with Irving’s co., on the Missouri Railway, six
years ago, when she said, “ Martin, you would be a splen-
did Sydney Oarton in ‘ The Tale of Two Cities.’ ” At
next town, he bought the book, and at once set about his
successful dramatisation. Harvey is only one of about
half-a-dozen clever playwrights who have figured as minor
members of Irving’s co.
The last London Gaiety hit is “ The Messenger Boy,"
and here is a verse from the song that hits hardest:—
“ If any crime is hard to disentangle,
You get the washerwoman in the box,
For when she’s put a party through the mangle
She knows him from his dickey to his socks.”
True, O King 1
“ The Merchant of Venice ” was acted in Vienna a few
weeks ago. The editor of an Anti-Semite paper wrote,
“ Let the Jews observe how Grillparzer, the author, one
of themselves, treats the Hebrew character." Then
William Shakespeare wrote to the paper, stating that he
was the author of the play, whereupon the editor apolo-
gised to Mr. Shakespeare.
Clement Scott gives the true story of Adelaide Neilson,
who got £4OO a week in London, and £7OO a week in
America. She was the illegitimate child of an actress
named Browne, and her father never could be discovered,
but was supposed to be a Spaniard. Her mother settled
at Guiseley, near Leeds, and married a paperhanger.
Little Adelaide used to assist him papering houses. She
studied her mother’s playbooks, and ran away from home
at the age of 14. She managed to get to London, arriving
without a penny, and slept in Hyde Park. Then she
became a seamstress, next a barmaid, then a theatrical
super. One Lee gave her two years’ schooling, and
married her. On the stage she quickly sprang to the top,
unrivalled in Juliet, Viola, and Rosalind. Neilson was an
assumed name. She never troubled about her mother —
who, by the way, is said to be still living. Miss Neilson went
on a star engagement to Leeds. Her mother said, “ I
have half a fancy that is my girl.” She went to see her,
and found it was. Miss Neilson then settled about £3OO
a year on her mother. The end of this distinguished,
amiable, and unfortunate actress was sad indeed. While
in Paris, out for a carriage-drive just after returning
from America, she took a glass of iced water, and was
seized with a fatal illness so rapid that she does not seem
to have been able to explain who she was. They took
her body to the morgue by the Seine, where it was
actually exposed on a slab in the glass-case, like those
fished out of the water. This was in 1880, and she had
been divorced from Lee in 1877.
Mrs. Kendal has placed it on record that she always
weeps when performing a pathetic part. Not so Jennie
Lee. When she was playing Jo in Melbourne a lady
friend who visited her between the acts enquired if the
comedienne had a satisfactory house. “ Oh, yes, I’ve got
a good lot of snivellers in front ” was the sprightly reply.
Sheridan’s first Australian season with “ Fun on the
Bristol ” happened at Melb. Royal in 1884, when the Age
referred to the show as a lamentably frivolous and foolish
novelty to desecrate the stage of Melbourne’s leading
theatre. Anything that suggested “ music-hall enter-
tainment ” was voted “ inferior ” in those way-back times,
but the poor old Royal has had to endure some awful
desecrations since then.

royd Fairclough once told me of a French actress (am
sure it was Eugenie Legrande), who was playing Anne of
Gloster to his Richard 111. ; when summoned to be
crowned Queen she protests, saying, “ Rather with deadly
venom let me be anointed.” Fairclough’s Anne, although
losing her memory of the exact words, remembered the
sense, and after a pause, stammered, “O, sooner rub me
all over with poisoned oil.”
Bishop Moorhouse, when in Melbourne, invited a
number of ministers of his church to hear Wm. Creswick,
the tragedian, give a series of Shakespearian readings at
Bishop’s Court, in the hope that tuey would profit by the
example and quit droning. The parsons listened in sullen
silence, and all afterwards agreed that they preferred
their own style of reading.
“ Scribe ” : When Bandmann and Mrs. Bandmann acted
“ Much Ado about Nothing ” in Melb., I wrote in the Age
that he was quite spoiling her acting. He went about
the bars saying “ Here’s a tarn cricket! He is trying to
make dissention between me and mein vife ! ” Bandmann
had the criticism printed on handbills and distributed.
When called before the curtain he fetched one of the
bills and read it. Then he said “ Ladies und Shentlemen,
shall I dell you vat I vould do mit de miscreant that
wrote that if I hat him here ? I vould dreat him dot vay
(tearing paper) und dot vay (another tear) und dot vay
(tear) und—dot vay ! ” (Flinging the fragments into the
stalls.) I didn’t challenge him.
Mrs. Chas. Kean’s worship of her commonplace husband
was ludicrous. A poor actor, who did Horatio to his
Hamlet, grossly offended him by appearing in faded
worsted scarlet stockings. Horatio went to seek Mrs.
Kean’s intercession. She said, “Mr. Kean will forgive
you, but will you be forgiven There ? ” pointing ecstatic-
ally Heavenward.
The Australian stage has contributed but few men to
the list of legislators. Geo. Coppin, its doyen, now hale
and hearty at the age of 81, is the most notable exception.
Ebenezer Ward (S.A.) studied roaring as a stock actor
with G. V. Brooke; and Mark Last King, for years a
member of Viq. Assembly, earned his living as a leading
tragedian in the forties.
It was the usual fragmentary dramatic co. pottering
about amongst the backblocks in feverish quest of its
daily beer, and it struck Boongabbie in a deplorable
financial state, bringing with it drought and famine.
“ East Lynne ” was put up in the Mechanics’ Institute,
and went very well in the presence of an audience that
was at least a guarantee of bed and sustenance for the
next 48 hours, when an excited, red-bearded settler in
the orchestra stalls arose, and was understood to demand
that Barbara Hare be handed over to his care and keep-
ing on the spot. Barbara, having a great profusion of
yellow wig and an exceedingly high color, was in much
favor with the bucolics, and the demand that the inter-
rupter be promptly and severely pitched out was unanim-
ous ; but this only excited him further. He broke loose
from a friendly arm, and clambered on to the stage, and
the play was suspended whilst he argued his claim to
Barbara, who, he declared, was his run-away daughter.
The company and manager argued back, but the woolly
bushman was perfectly wiling to fight the whole combin-
ation. Then Archibald Carlyle’s elderly female relative
took the floor. “Your daughter be blowed,” she said,
disgustedly. “ Why, she’s my son. We were a gal short
an’ he took the part.” Barbara Hare, as the handiest
means of corroboration, produced a pipe and tobacco, and
proved there and then that she smoked. The evidence
was held to be satisfactory, and the settler agreed that it
was a case of mistaken identity. But Boongabbie’s finer
feelings were hurt, and the co. left in the midst of the
worst financial perish it had ever struck.
Charles Warner furnishes Clement Scott with a sensa-
tional account of Federici’s death at Melb. Princess’s,
Charley being in Melbourne at the time. According to
this account, the officiating clergyman fell in a faint at
the grave, and died next day, and Warner had to finish
reading the burial service.
Clement Scott, the London theatrical critic, tells how,
at one of Lady Bancroft’s performances, he rushed from
the stalls to behind the scenes, with the tears on his
cheeks, to congratulate her. Here is a critic indeed ! He
seizes the actress by both hands and gasps, “ Thank You!
Thank You ! ” No wonder he is able to publish in his
book triumphantly an invitation to dinner, with Hubby
Bancroft lovingly referred to as “ Dear Old Bogey.”
Again does Clement tell how he was the only man in
London to appreciate Delaunay adequately. Delaunay
said, “ I will act Perdican t’night for You 1” Delaunay
came right from the back scene to the float on his knees !
A beautiful young lady in the stalls, perfect stranger to
Clement, grabbed him by the arm and dragged him off
his perch. She was transfixed ! She exclaimed, “ Oh, I
beg your pardon, but did you ever see such acting ? ”
According to Algernon West’s just-issued
“Recollections,” Marwood, the English hang-
man, when asked, “ What is the easiest death ? ”
replied, “My long-drop, sir. Peace, the bur-
gular, went hoff like a summer heve.”
In a recent speech, the N.S.W. Works
Minister promised a tram-line from Manly to
Pittwater. The present North Shore tram is
almost at once to be continued to the Spit, and it
is not at all likely that Manly and the Spit will
long remain unconnected by tram. The difficulty
about bridging Middle Harbor at the Spit can
easily be overcome by a punt built to ship loaded
trams.

IN HOT OR FOREIGN CLIMATES ENO’S ‘ FRUIT SALT’ is
INVALUABLE. It is the BEST and SIMPLEST preparation for
regulating the action of the LIVER that has yet been discovered, and relieves
the system of effete GOUTY, RHEUMATIC matter, the groundwork of
FEVERS and other diseases, which, if retained, poisons the blood and pro-
duces the most disastrous consequences. It allays nervous excitement, and
restores the nervous system to its proper condition by NATURAL MEANS.
The effect of ENO’S ‘ FRUIT SALT ’ upon any DISORDERED, SLEEPLESS,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Dash my buttons ! ” Hollis said suddenly, “ if
I don’t believe this is the old girl herself coming
off !”
I looked. From the palm-fringed beach was
streaming out a string of boats—color-laden with
scarlet and white and blue; a-sparkle here and
there with lifted points of metal; and marching,
many-paddled, across the indolent green water
towards the schooner.
“Somebody of importance, at all events,” I
said. “Though, if it is the Rani, I can’t
imagine ”
“ Oh, it’s the Rani right enough ! ” put in
'Singleton—the wet-blanket of the party. “And
you can bet your boots there’s going to be trouble
over those shooting-irons. I always said it was a
fool’s game to ”
“ Oh, damn your croaking ! ” interrupted Hollis
in turn. “ Why didn’t you keep out of it, then?
Gad, those chaps can paddle ! Here she comes.
Why, hang me if she isn’t quite young ! —and not
half bad-looking at that. ”
Palopa is but a comparative handful of an
island, and its ruler was doubtless straining terms
a little in dubbing herself Rani; nevertheless
there came with her up our bit of a side-ladder a
pretty convincing whiff of authority and domin-
ance. Dressed, save for the silver-broidered blue
handkerchief, entirely in gold-barred white, she
held up a ring-burdened hand as she turned a pair
of imperiously beautiful eyes from one to other of
us. Her people, clambering from the boats,
spread out on either side; multicolored of sarong
and baju ; calmly intent of countenance; the
stones in their kris-hilts sparkling in the sun.
“Who is the master here?” the dusky lady
asked in broken Spanish, allowing her gaze at last
to. rest upon Hollis, the apparent senior of our
trio. Hollis looked at Singleton, the real
and Singleton, in turn, as an adept at shirking
responsibility, indicated me with a wave of his
hand and a half-sneering laugh.
“ Because,” the Rani went on, still in badly-
damaged Castilian, “ this thing must not be ! The
guns you have sold to my people you must take
back again ! ”
I pretty well guessed her drift. She was afraid
of the Spanish authorities; and I knew that when
she took this stand there was no help for it—we’d
have to re-ship the rifles and ammunition. Bad
enough, that would be—to have them on our
hands going back—even if we didn’t have to re-
fund the price. , If we did I —well, the commercial
blueness of the prospect, in that event, was such
that I somewhat morosely answered with the
Malay proverb—“ The bargain that is cut with
words is like to be mended with blows ! ” It was
not exactly intended as a threat; if it had been, I
should have grievously mistaken my woman.
“Bargain!” she said, slipping into the same
tongue, and energetically slapping her little red
slipper on the deck. “No bargain shall there be
m Palopa but my bargain. Is truth in that ?
and she faced suddenly round upon., her retinue;
through which, to a salaam-accompaniment, ran
dutifully an answering murmur of—“lt is so,
Highness—truth is with thee ! ”
“Therefore!” and a chew of betel went into
“Highness’s” not unhandsome mouth —“there-
fore must ye send ashore and take your guns
again. In my own boat would I have brought
them back, but the Commissionista- Vistador shall
not have it to say that my servants even handled
them. As for the others —the sons of swine who
have dared thus to traffic without my knowledge—
they shall have fitting punishment in that ye shall
not pay them back their money ! ”
Hollis, who had been gloomily nibbling at a
cheroot, threw it overboard and looked at me.
“ Come ! ” he said in English,’ “that’s not too bad !
We’re willing to keep up our end of the contract,
of course; but, if authority steps in, why—”
“To be sure!” put in Singleton. Force
majeure, and all that sort of thing! Two thou-
sand dollars— -and the goods ! Dashed good busi-
ness, 7 call it! ” And Singleton symbolically
slapped his pocket as he looked at me.
I didn’t think it was going to be quite so rosy as
all that. I knew more of the Sulu character than
the others, and I noticed that her gold-barred
ladyship wore an ugly little smile as she guessed
from the faces the purport of the remarks she did
not understand.
“j ßut,” she went on, slowly, and the hard smile
deepened as she looked me haughtily in the face—
“ 7 will take the money !■ Bring it forth ! ”
Hollis said something with “dam!” in it.
Singleton’s disappointed hand fell away from his
pocket; then went instinctively up to his revolver-
pouch. “Think she means it?” he snapped at
me.
“Means it all right!” I said. “Means it so
unmistakably that, if we’re going to keep that
lucre, we’ll have to bum powder over it. And
that’ll be a cursedly awkward business in Spanish
waters, so-called.”
Hollis made up his mind, as usual, with a jolt :
‘ ‘ That money don’t go out of this schooner while
there’s a cartridge left in her ! See if you can’t
talk my-lady-wild-cat over first; but, if it’s no go,
I’m on the shoot, for one—Spanish waters or no
Spanish waters ! ”
“ I’m in ! ’’ assented Singleton, with a glance of
swift enquiry a,t me. I nodded, and then essayed
the remonstrance which I knew would be vested ;
especially as I wasn’t at all sure that the whole
thing wasn’t a “plant ” on her Highness’s part to
get the money and keep the value as well.
“We three white men,” I submitted, in my
choicest Malay, “were poor. We had put our
little all into this speculation; and, after having
run the risk of bringing the guns to Palopa, it
would indeed be hard if we had to chance the
Spanish gunboats a second time with them.
Would her Highness consider that 1 r ’
And her Highness, still industriously chewing
betel, answered only—“ The money ! —bring it
forth ! ”
“It was not our fault,” I meandered on, “that
we had acted contrary to her Highness’s wishes.
We had been misled by those of her subjects to
whom we had sold the guns ; and, though it was
doubtless but just, as her Highness had said, that
these trifiers with her authority should suffer loss,
it was hardly to be expected ”
“The money!” interrupted her Highness—
making a rapid sign ; in obedience to which her
two or three women-attendants scrambled hastily
• down into the boat; while the men, ominously
hitching’ forward their kris-hilts, drew closer up;
but still with faces as imperturbable as stone.
Our own Malays, who had been watching pro-
ceedings from for’ard, dived now into the fore-
castle like rabbits into their burrows, and
I was quietly unbuttoning my pistol-pouch
when, with a final demand for the money, the
Rani stepped forwards and spat towards us upon
the deck. Perhaps it was nhe bright-red of the
betel-juice, like blood upon the white planks, that
roused the sudden ferocity underlying Hollis’s un-
demonstrative upper nature. “Enough of this,”
he snarled, and jerked out his Smith-and-Wesson.
Out also flew Singleton’s “ gun ” and mine, and
a swift rattling of wooden scabbards answered, as
the rugged steel of a score of ltrisses leaped into
sight
“ Ola ! —la goleta ! ” came a sudden stentorian
hail, as if from another world—so intensely had the
situation held our attention. “Hullo !—the
schooner ! Are you all dead, or asleep ? ”
Within half a cable’s length of us a white-
painted steamer was getting a boat into the water.
She was a long, low, fore-and-aft-rigged vessel
with an immense rake in her masts, and the blood-
and-flame ensign of Spain on a jackstaff astern.
Hollis whistled as he pouched his pistol again.
“ We’re right in it now, and no mistake. Gun-
boat, I suppose ? ”
“Yes,” I said; “the Cid Campeador. I’ve
seen her at Manila. But I hope it’s only the
Commissioner-Visitor, old Nochebueno.”
.“Why?” '
“Because, otherwise, we’d be pretty sure to
lose the hooker—even if we didn’t get. sent up to
Manila in irons.”
The Oommissionista-Vistador it was, however
—a little bald, grey man, with an immense
moustache and a waggish eye. Seated on our
cabin-skylight he. heard and adjudicated. It
didn’t take him long to make up his mind after
the dollars cropped up in the case, and his decision
may here be put on record as a model of judicial
conciseness.
Rani to go ashore and deliver up to an officer
from the gunboat all the recently-landed arms
and ammunition. Englishmen to get their anchor
up, and go to the devil without delay— after
having delivered up the cash “as confiscate to
the uses of Her Most Catholic Majesty, the Queen
of Spain ! ’’—and here the Vistador, as he duti-
fully uncovered his billiard-ball crown, could
scarcely keep.the wink-derisive out of his wicked
old eye.
For, the “ uses of Her Most Catholic Majesty ”
meant simply, in this case, the uses of one Baltasar
Nochebueno ! “God rest his soul —he was a
merry man ! ” —but as no dollars, for all that,
ever came out of his grip, we had to call it a
euchre.
ALEX, MONTGOMERY.
The Making of Him.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The man sat on the log fence and smoked; the
lady stood beside him, her hands clasping his
knee her cheek pressed against him; both were
deeply contemplative.
He, a cheap hand about the homestead, 36, long
lean, somewhat ragged of hair and beard, the
traces of dissipation recently'worked out of his
blue eyes and tanned out of his thin cheeks. She,
2<>, small, thin, neat-handed, neat of coiffure,
neatly-dressed, like a bud in its calyx.
The young saplings grew thick and green about
their rendezvous; the keen, steely moon threw
lances at them through the large leaves.
Why shouldn’t I love you ? ” said the woman
defiantly, as if repelling a sneer. “ You are a
worker here, earning something, little enough I’m
sure. lam the worst of dependents—a poor rela-
tion.”
He put his pipe away and slipped to the
ground.
And yog do love me, Kate ?” he said, curiously,
with little feeling.
She put convincing arms about him, and looked
mutely into his face. He gazed down into her
eyes anxiously, but with the anxiety of an experi-
menter.
“ My God—she does 7”
‘* Even if I were daughter here—instead of dis-
tant cousin—l would still love you ! ”
He gathered her to him and kissed her lips.
“ I would love you if I were a queen,” she said,
passionately.
“ God bless you,” he murmured, “this will be
the making of me. I had lost hope. I thought it
wa3 all up with me, that I was pulled down and
trodden into the dirt, that the love of a lady was
as far beyond me as heaven is.”
He held her closely, and kissed her again and
again. He was very grateful.
‘ ‘ My love will help you ! ” said the tremulous
girl. “That is good to know. Ah, dear, that is
sweet talk to a woman !”
“It will be the making of me,” he said, with
conviction. “Remember that, Kate.”
There was a shrill call from the verandah.
“ Hush,” whispered Kate, “it is Aunt.” She
slipped from his arms, and ran noiselessly along
the fence, answering the call from a distance.
The man, peering through the boughs, watched
her up out of the moonlight on to the dark
verandah.
“Yes,” he said, “ she loves me, ragged and low-
down as I am. And if she, why not another —why
not the other? Yes, yes, I’ll go back to it all.
I’ll go back, and try respectability again—try
damned hard. If this one, why not the other —why
not the other ? ” He crossed towards the hut,
repeating the words mechanically.
Next day he clean-shaved, and returned to
Respectability, and the poor relation at the home-
stead saw him no more.

When a man gets interested in his business he
is very liable to forget about himself.
And when backache comes —when he feels de-
pressed and out of sorts, he contents himself with
the thought that he has worked too hard—he will
let up some of these days, when he gets the busi-
ness going a little better.
But he DOESN’T let up.
The backache gets worse and worse. The
■doctor says “Nervous Prostration” —advises a
trip to Tasmania or New Zealand.
But is it nervous prostration? No, it is the
kidneys. They can’t stand the strain put upon
them—they need help—they must have help if
;serious trouble is to be prevented.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have helped
thousands of hard-worked men and women here
in Australia to do their work easily, and keep
their health through it all. Here is an instance :
Mr. Maher, whose picture is given abov'e, is an
■old resident of Melbourne, living at 241 Latrobe-
street. “My back had been very bad,” says Mr.
Maher, “upto a year ago. It not only pained
me severely, but was so weak that I could scarcely
stand straight. The pains were located in the
small of the back, over the kidneys.
“That was one evidence that my kidneys were out
of order, but the other evidence was plainer. The
kidney secretions were of a very high colour, and
unnatural in quantity. I want to say that I have
not only obtained relief from the kidney trouble,
but I AM CURED, and Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills are alone responsible for this. I have
had no return of my trouble now for some months,
since taking them, and am thankful to feel I am
all right again. You may publish this as it is
true, and it may do good to others.”
(Signed) William Mahee.
It would be well if doctors and everyone who
has any kidney trouble, would carefully read the
above straightforward statement.
When your kidneys are not doing their work, it
will be manifested by pain or dull ache jn the
back, rheumatic pains, sciatica in the
urine, scanty supply, scalding irritation in
passing, obliged to go often during the day and to
get up during the night, uric acid, sleeplessness,
nervousness, irritability, sallow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles Under the eyes, loss
of energy and ambition.
If your water, when allowed to remain undis-
turbed for twenty-four hours, forms a sediment or
settling, or has a cloudy appearance, it is evidence
that your kidneys and bladder need immediate
attention. (
If you have any of the above symptoms Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will set you right and cure
you. We will gladly send you the names of
thousands who have testified to what Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have done for them. No-
where does the proverb “ Delays are dangerous ”
apply with such force as in kidney derangement.
When Bright’s Disease has set in the kidney
tissues are breaking down and passing away every
minute. The strength of the body is sapped,
steadily, surely.
Inasmuch as Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
alone stop kidney derangement should they not
be used without an hojur’s delay when the above
symptoms give unmistakeable warnings?

Don’t Neglect a Common Case
of Piles.
.IT MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS RESULTS.
When people generally understand that all such
fatal diseases as fistula, ulcer of the rectum,
fissure, etc., almost invariably begin in a simple
case of piles, they will learn the wisdom of taking
prompt treatment for the first appearance of
trouble in this quarter. Doan’s Ointment will
certainly cure every form of piles—itching, bleed-
ing, protruding, and blind piles —and hundreds of
lives have been saved by using this cheap but
effective remedy right at the start because at such
times a single pot will effect a curp, while in the
old, deep-seated, chronic cases several pots are
sometimes necessary before a cure is effected.
Here is a case in point
Mr. William Gilliver, of the well-known firm of
Gilliver and Curtis, Railway and General Con-
tractors, and whose private address is “ Avoca,”
Bankstown, has written the following unsolicited
letter which we herewith publish in full.
Messrs. FOSTER-McCLELLAN CO.,
76 Pitt-st., Sydney.
Feb. 14 th, 1899.
Dear Sirs, —In justice to you and suffering
humanity I write to say that I suffered from
itching piles for 22 years. I tried many doctors
and pretty well all kinds of patent medicines, but
got relief for a short time only. Seeing your
Ointment advertised I bought a pot—and did not
use more than one-half of it, now six months ago
—and lam perfectly cured. You may use this as
you wish.—Yours gratefully, TTT _,„
WILLIAM GILLIVER.
It cannot be repeated too often that Doans
Ointment will cure itching piles. IT WiL-L
CURE THEM ABSOLUTELY. But do not
take the manufacturer’s word for this; ask or
write Mr. Gilliver. He knows, for it cured hitn,
and he lives at Bankstown, a suburb 12 miles
from Sydney. Is not that the best possible kind
of proof ? Could there be better ?
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all dealers-at 2s 9d
per box, or will be posted on receipt of py

But—be sure it is DOAN’S.
His Confession.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I do not know if death can give
Me larger life or endless sleep.
(I do not covet, while I live,
The gauds for which men strive and weep.)
I do not share —I’m glad to say—
The futile fetish-faiths of Gath ;
Little I long (who love To-Day)
For any sugared aftermath.
But this I know : that if, perchance,
Death is the threshold of the spheres,
My love of you must still enhance
The beauty of the spirit-year 3.
I pray (lest prayer avail) that if
I wake when life’s sweet sun has set
To deathless joys superlative,
I’ll wake in your soft arms, Suzette !
I do not crave the sickly bays
And plaudits of this barren time ;
I care no whit though fools may praise
Me, or condemn. Not mine to climb
The filthy ways to power and place,
Bemired amid the fetid air ;
The hopes that other men embrace, •
Or fair or foul, I do not share.
But this I crave : the right to stand
With you, and let the mad world gang
Its sorry gait; thus hand-in-hand
To hear the songs the Sirens sang.
I‘will not live for Art, bemused
By cant of every puling set
That daubs and prates. . . These thingsrefused
‘Tis sweet to live for you, Suzette
I do not wish that I might be
The idol of the “ fit ” and “ few’ -
For paltrier popularity
I would not rob one hour from you .
I have a secret treasure. When
I look within my heart of hearts,
I see you know ! Let poorer men
Play-out life’s myriad poorer parts !
But this I wish : that I might prove
For but a moment worth a thought
Of yours ; and yet you give—your love !
How can I tell you as I ought
The measure of my thankfulness ?
The overpowering sense of debt
That he irs on me, words can’t express . . .
But somehow . . . still . . . you know,
Suzette !

FRANK MORTON.
His Day’s Work.
A HUMAN DOCUMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a Writer—a clever man, who had for 20
years made what the poorest pot house-keeper
would scorn to call a living by writing for the
Press. But then he was by nature gay, sociable,
generous, and congenitally incapable of looking
forward to the morrow—from the personal point
of view. When it came to dealing with the mat-
ter in an abstract way, or from the point of view
of the general, he was a master of his subject—a
Socrates—a Solomon. Theoretically he was a
first-class man of affairs, who knew exactly what
to do, and how, when, and where to do it; practi-
cally, he was a man who always did the right-
handed thing in the left-handed way.
* ¥ * *
There was some food in the house for the wife
and the children, and a little credit—already
strained almost to breaking point—for some more
provisions. But the rent was many weeks in
arrears, and the baker and the milkman
were no longer cheery in their remarks when
the eldest little girl went to the door to
take in their wares. Worst of all, the time-
payment man had issued his final threat with
regard to taking away the furniture. The Writer
himself cared nothing for furniture, and had no
respect whatever for his Lares and Penates. A
time-honored table or chest of drawers or chef-
fonier that had been five months in his house was
no more venerable to him than the hand-painted
vase that had come into it yesterday. He had no
reverence at all for old associations, and never per-
mitted his affections to twine around Chinese-
made sofas or rocking-chairs. But with his wife
it was another matter. She clung to them. It is,
to a certain masculine order of mind, inconceiv-
able how women can become so much attached to
inanimate objects. You tbll one of these dear,
good women that a wardrobe, which a couple of
brutal men are taking down the passage in order
to lift it into a cart, is simply a common wooden
construction, the like of which, and better, can be
obtained at any time, and she will wring her hands
and reply, “But not that one—never that one
again, never, never.”
Yet this is the exact type of Christian woman
who is scandalised beyond measure when she hears
that there are savages who worship wooden gods !
* * * *
But the Writer, although careless and indifferent
about most things, had a chivalrous respect for the
superstitions of his wife. And it was this trouble
about the furniture that worried him more than all
the other uneasiness put together.
She had a clean collar, and shirt, and handker-
chief ready for him, and a pansy, first blossom of
its kind in the little garden in the backyard, for
his buttonhole, and gave the last brushing to his
coat, and then the tiny children, cheaply clean but
very clean, and ready for school, came to kiss him.
“Pa’s going to Town,” whispered one of the
girls in high glee.
“It’s his Town,” said the smaller girl with a
decisive nod of her little fair head.
“ Lot you know,” remarked the eldest boy m a
tone of derision, “Pa only owns a newspaper office
there.
“ Have they any Noah’s Arks there ?” enquired
the youngest boy, who was always on business
be And, of course, the Writer had to reply that the
Noah’s Arks, and the wooden patriarchs who came
out of them, could only be found in the Sydney
Moening Hebald office.
And then the children, happily ignorant of
debts, or bailiffs, or troubles of any kind except
their own little five-minute tragedies, danced gaily
away to school.
When they were gone the wife kissed him, and
told him to come home soon. He knew that she
was looking after him through the curtains, and
squared his shoulders and walked with a springy
step across the street and over the vacant suburban
flat.
• * • •
But, although he had left home with a gallant
air, he had no great heartsomeness in him when he
arrived in the city. It is, of course, a necessity of
nature that a man should be a hero to his wife and
children, but when he meets with other men who
have also to be heroes to their wives and children
—then comes the tug of war. And, on this par-
ticular day, the Writer felt neither physically nor
mentally fit for tugging with anybody. But he
meant to do his best all the. same. He called first
at a certain newspaper office to see if there were,
by any chance, any possible letters with impos-
sible cheques in them, left for him. There were
none. He was not disappointed. That was a certain
part of the day’s work done, anyhow, and nobody
could say he was not striving to earn his living.
Then he called at the office of one of his friends,
who had, about a week before, asked him to hold
himself in readiness to write an elegy upon some-
body who had died suddenly in a rich agricultural
district. The Friend was out, and the office-boy
gave the Writer a chair. But when, presently, the
Friend came in, he said, in brief, that the Elegy
was “off.” The subject was three weeks dead,
and was already a stale subject to his relatives and
admirers. As if elegies were like hot-cross buns !
But the Friend of the Writer asked the Writer to
3ome out and have a drink. And the Writer did.
* * • *
No time was wasted, however. The Writer,
feeling a little better and more hopeful, called at
the lodgings of another Friend, who was engaged
upon a serial novel, and who was willing to pay in
advance (glorious word !) for help in carrying the
story to its conclusion. The Person who answered
the door stated that the Novelist in question had
not been seen or heard of for a week, and wished
to know if the Writer knew anything of his where-
abouts. Irony ? The Person did not mean it as
such, but it was very fine irony all the same.
• • * »
Two strings to the Writer’s bow had snapped.
Never mind. Try the next. Newspaper office.
Editor in chair. Writer explains that he wishes
to write some swift, bright, terse, glowing things
in verse and prose about current subjects.
“ Sorry,” said the Editor very politely, “but that
would interfere with our present contributors.”
“ But I don’t see how,” said the Writer, “ there
is no sign of it in the paper.”
“Hush!” said the Editor. “Don’t speak so
loud—it’s a superstition of the office. But I
know ”
• * * *
It was nearly one o’clock then. And the Elegy
Man turned up and became an Amphitryon.
After lunch the Writer and the Elegy Man and
some other Bohemians played dominoes. Four
played and two looked on, and there was not one
face amongst the lot that was not creased with
care. The Writer, sitting in that cosy corner
looking out on the quadrangle of ferns and green
pot-plants, said that the company reminded him
of the company in the Decameron who made
mirth and played—to keep the plague away a
little while longer. All the time that the Writer
was playing he was saying to himself, “If they
who trust in you at home could only see you
now ! ” And yet there was nothing better to do
at the time. All business people were away at
lunch somewhere or other. And the sun shone
through delicate green tracery into the alcove, and
the world was going very well. And the wife at
home believed that her husband was trudging
sternly and cheerfully around the city looking for
money to bring home.
• * • *
But although, until then, nothing definite, or
even indefinite, had occurred, the Writer ap-
peared to take a more sanguine view of things. „ .
Possibly affairs at home were not half so bad ais.h©
believed they were when he left in the morning,
... A man is always apt to exaggerate when he
is in the midst of his domestic environment.
Besides, there is no sense in meeting troubles half-
way. And some eminent person said that after a
time letters required no answering. So it might
be with bills. And then again—what says Emer-
son?—
The most of your ills you have cured,
And the worst of them still have survived.
But what torments of thoughts you endured
From the evils that never arrived 1
* » * *
The Writer went away by himself and tried to
think out—thump out —thrash out —something- to
write about. But your dull ass will not mendi by
beating, and he gave up the job in despair:. -Fust
then he found himself close by the door ©f a),
bonded store, and who but Mr. Newtown, of that
ilk, should ask him in to give an opinion upon
some bonded cheese. It was very good cheese- —
none better.
• * * *
No money had been earned, or found, or
borrowed —it had not yet come to steal'ng, with
the Writer —and the afternoon was yellowing into-
red. And the pansy was dead and had been taken
out of his buttonhole and thrown away. A broken-
down wreck of a man passed by. Bis; dreadful
clothes seemed to hang together less by power of
string than by power of grease. Yet there was-
something in the air of the man that spoke of pre-
vious culture and cleanliness in some far-off time.
But he was indescribably, ineffably dirty. The-
Writer remarked to himself that it is only men
that have been accustomed to wash themselves,,
who, when they take to drink and go to the dogs
and forswear soap, can look unwholesome beyond
description. And the wreck of a man passed by
without shame, without thought, without hoptv
Why should he care for any of these things ? But
the Writer looking at him said to himself with s.
shudder —“ Could I ever come to this ?” And yet—
* * » *
The writer went home that evening without
money in his pocket—that is, money worth;
speaking about. Three or four shillings. Tht
wife, in spite of persuasion, said she would sit uj >
and iron a whole shirt and new collar for bin
which lie should wear upon the morrow in ord'
to go forth again and conquer.
My God !
The Bailiff did not come in that day, anyhow
I had half-expected to meet him.
To-morrow !
It is a new day to-morrow.

u I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in my family for years with the most satis-
factory results.
“ During the warm, debilitating days of summer it acts as a tonic and seems
to build up the system and restore the appetite.
“ I have always given it to my children, whose photograph I send you with
this letter, for any disorder of the blood, and, in fact, for all diseases peculiar
to children.
“I have found it greatly improved their health by getting at the root of the
disorder quicker than any other preparation.”
These are the children of Mr. and Mrs. Morrall W. Curran, of Bowen Hills,
Brisbane, Queensland. Mr. Curran sends us this strong testimonial. It shows
again why the people have named Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
The old and young alike are cured with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, for it is a family
medicine. Give a few doses to the children any time they have indigestion,
sleeplessness, loss of appetite, headache, or general weakness. If they are pale
and thin, or have any rashes or pimples, they certainly need it. If you wish
the cure to be prompt, and if you wish it to last, be sure and use “Ayer’s.”
There is nothing “Just as Good.”

PASTEURISED
BUTTER • • •
The same remarks that apply to milk apply equally to butter. Pasteurised butter is made from the very finest
cream, consequently the butter has a fine aroma that only Pasteurisation can give. There are a few, we are
pleased to say, only a few, idiotic folks who will not be convinced of the value of the process ; but it is satisfactory
to ktiow that these are getting less daily. The difference in price between Pasteurised, beautifully-flavored butter and the
ordinary make is only |d. per lb. It would pay consumers well to give six times this difference. Heads of households should insist
that their grocer supplies Pasteurised butter, and if he will not, send your orders to US, and we will deliver it at your doors.
Good butter such as we have described is appreciated always, whereas at afternoon teas or for ordinary use
at any price. The famous “ Berry ” brand Pasteurised butter can be obtained only from this Company.
bad butter is dear
