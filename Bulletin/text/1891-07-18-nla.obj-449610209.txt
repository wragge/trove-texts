■U
This eminent Specialist, Fomider, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES,
lie has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to -hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulnces, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for ho has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH*BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary cxpcnco. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
lion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
*Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they arc destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Ricbardshas successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SATURDAY, JULY 18, 1891.
Wages.
The most generally accepted theory regarding
wages is that we are governed by the laws of sup-
ply and demand. This doctrine assumes that
there is a fixed proportion of the capital of every
country available for the payment of wages, and
if the supply of workers be decreased the share
which each individual will receive of this capital
will be greater, while on the contrary, if the
supply be augmented wages will fall. Thus, if the
wages fund,” as it is called, be £lO,OOO, and the
supply of workers 5000, each share of cash is £2; if
the number fall to 4000 the share of each is £2 10s.,
while if the workers are 7500, the share of each is
£1 6s. Bd. This is the theory, divested of its
verbiage, which is countenanced by Adam Smith,
Mill and the larger portion of their immediate
followers. In upholding it these writers main-
tain that the determination of the price of labour
differs in no respect from the determination of the
price of any other commodity, that all are alike
regulated by supply and demand, over the
laws of which the labourer has no control. No
one who has studied the question will gainsay the
truth of a portion, at least, of this- theory, vi?:.,
that wages, being the price of labour—that is to
say, the rates at which labour will exchange for
any other commodity—are therefore subject to the
same laws in regard to exchange as all cither com-
modities.
* * *
With all due respect to Mill and the others, to
say that prices are fixed by the laws of supply and
demand is palpably incorrect. If it were so, all
commodities, the supply of which exactly balances
the demand, must have an equal exchange
value; and any article for which there is
a greater demand than supply, must of neces-
sity be higher in price than another of which
the supply is in excess. We should accordingly
sometimes see pumukins selling at equal rates with
watches, and coal with silverware, that is if the
supply and demand were in each case equal. The
absurdity of the original theory has been suffi-
ciently obvious to induce the later economists of
this school to so, alter it that it now reads : “ The
ratio at which commodities will exchange is regu-
lated by the supply and demand at a price* and
competition determines what that price shall be.”
It would be beyond the scope of this article to
discuss the numerous contradictions which the
supply and demand theory involves; one or two
cases, however, may be given to illustrate our
meaning. Taking England, since it is thecountry
concerning which there is most information, it
may be broadly stated that there never was a time
within the last 400 years when the supply of
labour was not in excess of the demand; there-
fore, according to the Smith-Mill theory, wages
should have continuously tended to fall there,
whereas, the fact is, wages have constantly tended
upwards, in spite of the atrocious enactments by
which the English Parliament sought to repress
labour.
* # #
It is estimated by competent authorities that in
the palmiest days of American labour there are at
least five out of a hundred labourers who cannot
find work, while usually the proportion ranges
from seven and a-half to ten—and yet wages do
not fall. Some of our readers may remember the
days when the <ilite from Potts Point and Toorak
fought over the possession of the servant girls
imported by a complaisant country. There is no
gainsaying that the demand then exceeded the
supply, for 200 heated dowagers usually struggled
for 50 servants. We do not strive for arithmetical
accuracy, but it may be roughly deduced that in
such a case as the one just mentioned, where the
demand was four times the supply, wages should
have gone up four times. They did not, however;
they simply stood still.
« * *
The truth is, the law regulating prices is not
that of supply and demand. The ratiobetween the
amount of commodities and the demand, affects
their price, but does not determine it. What
does determine it is the cost of production. A
familiar example will best illustrate this. Suppose
all the butter consumed in the country is made
by five persons. A has inferior appliances and
can afford to sell at Is. per pound, B at lid., C at
10d., D at 9d., and E at Bd. So long as the
quantity produced is not in excess of the require-
ments, the price obtained will be Is., for as A’s
quantity is needed to complete the supply, and as
lie cannot sell below Is., what he must get for his
butter is what the others may and will get.
Should the production be increased beyond the
requirements of the community a portion must
remain unsold. This portion must necessarily be
A’s, since it is the dearest and the price will fall.
As A cannot continue making at a loss he will be
compelled to stop work, and B’s price of lid. will
regulate the market, but only so long as the
necessary supply is not exceeded by the production
of the makers; when it is exceeded prices will
again fall, and B will be driven out of competi-
tion, just as A was. This process will continue so
long as the production exceeds the supply, until
the lowest point (E’s price) is reached. Beyond
this the price cannot fall, for as'E cannot afford
to make butter at less than Bd., he will not do so,
at all events, for any long period. Should the
production by any chance exceed the demand
prices will, of course, instinctively fall below the
cost of production, but production will then cease,
and the normal cost of production will determine
the price of the commodity produced,
# # #
From this reasoning the law may be deduced
that the price of any commodity is relatively
determined by the cost of producing that portion
of the necessary supply which is produced under
the least advantage. That is while A’s produc-
tion was part of the necessary supply, A’s price
was the one which determined that of the whole
supply. This is the normal condition of things.
In ordinary practice, when B and the others find
that A cannot go below a certain price, and they
desire to increase their business by driving A out,
they fix the price at a point below his cost of pro-
duction, and if they are able to produce the requisite
quantity, this price, and not A’s, regulates the
market; but under no circumstances can any
maker continuously sell for less than the cost of
production, which cost is again fixed by the
labourer’s standard of living. Hence it is that
though a demand suddenly increased may enable
makers to obtain for a time a large advance on the
price at which they can afford to sell, a fall in the
demand will not bring prices below the level of
the cost of production.
« # *
We may, therefore, take it as a general law that
the cost of producing that part of the necessary
supply produced at the least advantage, deter-
mines the price of a commodity, and that prices
also tend downwards to the cost of the commodity
produced at the best advantage—that is, at the
cheapest rate. Labour is a commodity just the
same as any of the things which it helps to pro-
duce —it is, therefore, governed by the self-same
laws, so that the price of labour is determined by
the cost of producing that portion of the necessary
supply, which is produced at the least advantage.
What, then, is the labour utilised to the least
advantage? It is the labour of the worker who
has a family to support, and the labour which
costs least to utilise is that of the unmarried
worker.
# • *
No man with a family to support will consent
to work for less than will enable him to maintain
himself and family, according to the standard of
living to which they have been accustomed. It
is, therefore, evident that, so long as the labour
of men with families is part of the necessary
supply, so long will the cost of their support—
that is to say, the cost of producing their labour —
be the wages of their trades. Let it be imagined
that the workers are divided into two equal
bodies, married and single—the former are able
to support themselves and families on 40s. a week,
while the latter require but 255. Suppose, also,
there is work for the major part of these labourers,
then the wages will be 40s. for married and single
alike. Now, if the demand for labour falls so low
that there is employment for less than one-half,
the price of labour will tend downwards until it
reaches 255., because the labour of men who require
40s. to live forms no part of the necessary supply;
while below 255, wages cannot fall. Fortunately,
such a contingency is practically impossible, and
the standard of living, which the ordinary labourer
and his family enjoy, determines the wages that
he will receive.
# # #
Just here it may be well to meet a plausible
objection, which will be advanced against this
theory. It may be argued that it is the rate of
wages which determines the standard of living,
and not the reverse, as we have stated. A little
investigation will dispose of this objection.
Wages in America are uniformly high, so
high that the trades organisations have, with
the greatest difficulty, been able to maintain
them. The standard of comfort enjoyed by
the native workman is superior to that of any of
the European workers, consequently even the
best of these can improve their lot by emigrating
to American soil. As a result, the world has seen
an exodus of Irish, German, Italian, English,
and other European labourers to the new world.
Men who lived in Galway contentedly on “pota-
toes and point,” in Silesia on beer and black
bread, in Umbria or Calabria on oil, bread, or
macaroni, find themselves able, when translated
to Chicago or Charleston, to live in a style un-
thought of in their wildest dreams. The effect is
what might be readily anticipated. The ignorant
foreigner cannot at once adapt himself to the
standard of American comfort, except perhaps in
regard to food ; the wages he can earn are much
above his needs, and he either spends the surplus
in debauchery, or, working only for part of the
week, earns sufficient to keep him according to his
low standard of comfort. Thus the native Ameri-
can with difficulty maintains wages, at the point
which ho deems necessary for the proper support
of his family, confronted by toilers whose mode
of life is entirely different.
m m m
It is evident enough that the standard of living
fixes the wages, and not the wages the standard
of living. In this connection may be mentioned
the peculiar circumstance that the best workmen
of every country find difficulty in living in their
own country. Thus the best Americans or Aus-
tralians find their wages no more than they need
for their support, so, too, will the Englishman,
the German and the Italian when at home. It is
also worthy of remark that the Englishman whose
means of living are so narrow in his own land,
does well in America or Australia, the German
does well in England and saves, while the Italian
in Germany has also made a fortunate exchange
of fatherland.
* # #
It is an historical fact that when the free opera-
tion of labour has not been restrained by laws,
wages have advanced with civilisation. The laws
against labour in England were so severe during
three centuries, as almost to keep down the
natural tendency of the population to improve
their standard of comfort. With the French
revolution and the dawn of the factory system
came a new 'fcrder of things. Restrictions to
travelling were removed, social intercourse was
necessarily developed and the standard of living
rapidly rose, so that in a very short period wages
almost doubled. In Australia the same phenpiriena
are observable. In the good old days of beggary, a
day’s wage was about four shillings, men were bred
to believe that anything above a full convict
ration was a foretaste of paradise, were content
with a pittance, since it gave them all they needed.
With the roystering days of the gold- seekers came
men with other ideas. Their minds were not
bounded by the traditions of a convict regime.
Their money came easily and was spent freely,
and their legacy to Australia is a standard of
comfort higher than any to be found elsewhere.
# # *
The first duty of the labourer in this country, or
any other country, is not to save, as some of his
mentors would have him believe : it is to see that
the comfort of his family is not only maintained,
but increased. In so far as saving is an aid to
this, it is good, but when it tends to lower the
comfort of his class—that is, the standard of living
—it is a distinct evil. Men whose wages are
sufficient to enable them to indulge themselves
with a four-roomed house and to clothe their
families neatly and well, but who prefer living in
a two-roomed shanty where the common decencies
of life cannot possibly be preserved, and, for the
sake of a balance in the savings bank, permit their
children to go meanly clad, are not the self-deny-
ing heroes that some would pretend. They are
the_enemies of their children, of morality and of
their fellows, and are preparing for the time,
when what they now do voluntarily will have to
be done of necessity. Workmen of Australia,
your duty is to maintain high wages, rot that you
may save, but that you and your’s may live in
comfort.
* * #
A few words more and we have finished. It
may be argued, if wages are determined by the
standard of living, there is no limit to the wages
which labourers may demand —that if they choose
to live like lords they will be paid like lords. The
objection is apparently a strong one. A little ex-
planation,, however, and it vanishes. The price
of labour is governed by the cost of it to the pro-
ducer, this we have shown is the standard of
living which he enjoys. It is, however, governed
by something else—the produce of his labour. If,
then, after the cost of governing and theearn-
ings of capital be taken from the total produce,
there be sufficient when divided by the number of
labourers to enable each to live like lords, there is
nothing in the nature of things to prevent them
so living, for the capitalist is merely a social out-
growth that later generations may entirely dis-
pense with.
Another “National Party.”
When the Last Day arrives, and the heavens
and the earth fall together with a gruesome
smash, and the stars bolt in affright, and lost
comets dash round unexpected corners of the
firmament, and red-hot suns trample madly
over mislaid asteroids, and all is panic and dis-
organisation—then there will be a strange and
horrid voice heard among the ruins of the globe
voice of the last monopolist who is busy
founding an Association on top of the wreckage,
and passing resolutions to provide for the main-
tenance of Law and Order, and to promote the
influx of foreign capital, and the investment of
hard cash upon good shecurity. There is some-
thing sad and incurable about that monopolist,
and there is a hideous weariness about these
resolutions which he passes for the maintenance
of Law' and Order. He is so dull, so fat and
thick-headed, so hopelessly incapable of realising
that the whole universe wasn’t built for the sole
purpose of having capital invested in it, that it
would be utterly impossible even to blast a new
idea into his intelligence. When the outer
world asks for anything he looks at it with a
distracted and surprised air—the noise it
makes disturbs him in the process of investing
his capital. When the nation tries to do any-
thing or to reform anything he tells it to keep
quiet and let things slide, lest it should shake
up his capital, and he is filled with genuine
amazement because the rest of humanity doesn’t
take as much interest in his capital as he does
himself.
* # •
These reflections are aroused chiefly by the
conduct of an alleged “ National Association,”
which started business the other day in Mel-
bourne. Its avowed object is to be the germ of
a great “National Party,” and the first begin-
ning of a vast upheaval which will pulverise
the rising Labour-party, and its stock-in-trade
consists of one or tw r o resolutions, about forty
overgrown stomachs, and one cablegram. For
the Association, at the close of its first meeting,
cabled itself to England as being the great
unanimous outburst of the Australian" people,
and Baron Reuter humped this baseless asser-
tion along at the customary rates. There are
seven purposes in the Association’s programme,
and all of them are as vague and undefinable as
an unsupported statement up a tree, but they
have all a high-class and gentlemanly tendency,
and though they are somewhat thin and sloppy,
none of them seem likely to bring a blush to
the most modest cheek. They run as follow's—
or, rather, being too feeble to run, they sit
down-and flop aimlessly
1. To preserve the national character of the Legislature,
the association affirming that representatives should not
be the delegates of any section of society.
2. To oppose all unconstitutional political procedure,
and thereby assist in maintaining law and order, and
particularly to. secure the effectual protection of all
persons engaged in honest industry.
3. To assert and defend the right of every person in the
community to dispose of his labour and capital with
perfect freedom within the law.
4.. To prevent undue interference with the great pro-
ducing interests of the colony, to encourage co-operation
and good feeling amongst all classes, to further to the
utmost the development of the agricultural, pastoral,
mining, and manufacturing interests, and to vigorously
oppose all class legislation injurious thereto.
0. To promote in all ways peace, security and general
confidence, in order that the public credit may be sus-
tained and the investment of capital encouraged, that a
maximum of employment may he provided, and that all
interests may share in a common prosperity.
6. To uphold a just balance of electoral representation,
giving proper weight to the claims of country districts.
upon the progress of which national life greatly depends.
7. To secure the due registration of Parliamentary
electors and the regular and systematic revisian of the
electoral-rolls.
* * #
The first thing that strikes the eye in this
programme is the desire of the Association “to
preserve the national character of the Legisla-
ture.” What the “national character” may
be is not stated, and where the object may be
lying round isn’t mentioned. The character of
the Victorian Legislature for seven years nast
has consisted principally of the fact that
Gillies’ cash wouldn’t square, and that Bryan
O’Loghlen has been Opposed to everything, and
the other characteristics have been aimless
whoopings about “ loyalty,” and a desire on the
part of everybody to get a railway constructed
with loan-money. The character of the people,
on the other hand, has consisted principally of
football, and, as a. natural consequence, there is
a discrepancy somewhere ; but it doesn’t matter
much. Anyhow, the Association proposes to
preserve the thing, whatever it may be ; and to
suppress “ class representation.” As everybody
must belong to some class, and as every class
has always tried to .secure all the representa-
tion it could get, and has wanted more after it
got it, this is a somewhat large order-; and
when it is promulgated by a class of forty or
fifty large-stomached men whose object is to
grab all the representation that is going, it
becomes still larger.' But that doesn’t matter
much either. Society, in a general way, is
divided into two sections, the first comprising
one per cent, of the population, and the other
ninety-nine ; and “class representation ” is the
state of things which prevails when the ninety-
nine per cent, is running the machine of State
and the one per cent, is cursing because it isn’t
running it instead.
* # *
The Association is also going to show a solid
front against all “ unconstitutional procedure,”
and as no one knows, or ever has quite known,
what the constitution—which is unwritten—is,
this loose statement may pass without much
attention. In a general sense, constitutional
procedure is the procedure of the man who is
speaking, and unconstitutional procedure is the
procedure of the other man. It is an open
question whether anybody ever was constitu-
tional since the world started, or whether any-
body ever was unconstitutional either, but that
is a matter of merely passing importance. The
problem might be settled some day if anybody
could find the constitution, but nobody ever
will find it, for there isn’t any such thing in
existence. Samples of it have been dug out
occasionally in the ‘Supreme Court and the
Privy Council, but the whole, original article
can’t be dropped upon anywhere. Further,
according to clause 3, the forty fat men intend
to assert the right of every man “ to dispose of
his labour and capital with perfect freedom
within the law.” This means, we presume, that
the one side can strike if it wants to, and that
the other side can see it stew in its own gravy, if
it chances to feel that way inclined, and they are
both doing it without any assistance from the
Association. Also, they have have both been
doing it more or less for several thousand years,
and will probably do it for several thousand
more, and the Association can’t make them do
it or make them stop doing it any more than
it can regulate the price of birds-nest soup in
Mongolia. And, anyhow, it is an asinine pro-
cedure for any Association to form itself for the
purpose of letting people do what they have
done all along; and that body of capitalists
would have acted a good deal more wisely if it
had organised itself into a powerful society,
with a strong reserve fund, for the purpose of
letting it rain in wet weather and for allowing
the thunder to roll when it wanted rolling.
* # «
Still, however, The Bulletin has no desire
to discourage any “National” organisation,
and the statement in clause 4, that the new
society will do its best to “ further the agri-
cultural, pastoral, mining, and manufacturing
interests,” is in every way commendable. It is
not to be supposed, of course, that the Associa-
tion will put up a cent to assist any of these
interests, except so far as it makes money out
of them, but it will lend them its countenance
and patronage—it will give three cheers when
it sees anybody digging potatoes, and will
afford its moral support to the individual whose
back is nearly broken through hauling up a
bucket of wash-dirt out of a shaft. Probably
enough the agricultural and mining interests
will resent this encouragement, and will rush
after the Association with a board, in which
case that body will doubtless bolt for' the
nearest place of safety, and there draw up a
report and a vote of thanks. It is also intended
to “ encourage good feeling among all classes,”
which may be defined as an intention to
encourage all classes to feel the way the
Association feels, and to discourage any
class which feels the way the Association
doesn’t feel. The Association’s own feeling is a
feeling .of stuffed sensation under the waistcoat,
arising from too many dinners, and it will in-
cite all other people to have the sajne symptoms
at their own expense, and will, discountenance
anybody who experiences a < hollowness in the
region of the stomach. And,’above all things, it
intends to promote “peace, security, and
general confidence,’ and “the investment of
capital.” It wants peace because it is un-
pleasant to be hit in the wind just after seven
courses ; it wants security because it is too fat
to run; and it-pines after general confidence
because confidence is a blessed thing at all
times, and leads the poor to put their savingtfin
the busted building society and the bottomless
mining swindle, and to buy up allotments at
boom prices, and to believe in time-payment
furniture, and to get left in all manner of com-
mercial frauds out of which the National Asso-
ciationists get considerable pickings. Also, it
supports the investment of capital for reasons
that are too obvious to be worth mentioning.
* * *
Taking it all round, the new institution
doesn’t Took like a matter that will do much
damage to the rising cause of Labour. Even
its resolution to secure “a just balance of elec-
toral representation ” doesn’t seem to amount
to much, for the man who gets most votes will
still get in after the same mean, underhand
fashion as of old ; and the desire to give i \


general support to “ the national life ” is some-
what indefinite. The national life will probably
crowd through without the help of the Associa-
tion, and if it can’t, it is too impalpable a thing
to allow of that body shoving it from behind—
it would be about as easy to shove a disease, or
to crowd a popular impression through a key-
hole, or to run down the Voice of the Past and
grasp it by the tail. The new organisation,
considered in all its bearings, seems to be a
good deal of a mule. Its stock-in-trade consists
of sundry fat men, seven platitudes, and
a cablegram. Its objects, as defined in the
advertisement, are “to maintain law, order,
and good Government,” but the country hasn’t
much good Government to maintain, and order
is all right and doesn’t need maintenance, and
the Labour-party is also bent on maintaining
} aw __tliat is, it means to get some new laws,
and to maintain them after it has got them.
The only asset worth mentioning which the
hew gang possesses is thetrenlendous gall which
has led it to christen itself the “ Victorian
National Party.” If unmitigated cheek can
drag ah Association through this is obviously
the sort of Association that will get through
every time.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Shearers’ Republic.
The Brisbane Courier is dishing up for the
hundred and fiftieth time the gruesome narra-
tive of that Shearers’ Republic which was just
going to happen, but didn’t take place, in
Queensland, owing to the fact that it failed to
come off on account Of circumstances which have
been frequently explained, and which have
grown more and more murky with each explana-
tion; The Courier’s story (supplied by amilitary-
officer who was formerly a newspaper-man) of the
Reign of Terror that fell through is muddled and
incoherent, but by piecing together the ruins and
fragments of its statements the matter stands
about thus:—The plan was con-
structed in a damp cavern at midnight. There
was no moon, and the wind howled dismally on
the mountains, and the air was as dark as a
hypocrite’s Sunday tail-coat at 12 p.m., and the
rain sloshed down with a dreary slosh upon the
dead leaves underfoot. After awhile the boss
of the Shearers’ Union could be heard approach-
ing through the trees, and blaspheming horribly
as he came ; also he was gnashing his teeth and
foaming at the mouth. The remains of a dead
capitalist were sticking out of his pocket, and
he dragged a murdered and partially-eaten
banker behind him. He had eight limbs alto-,
gether, and travelled like an immense spider*
and he had one bloodshot eye, about the size of
a cocoa-nut, in the middle of his forehead J
in addition to which he had a scalded
look about him, and was drunk and caked
all over with mud. The other party to
the transaction was waiting for him in the cave.
He was shaped like an octopus, and smelt hor-
ribly of sulphur, and he was covered with a
shiny crust that looked like a mixture of
squashed black beetles, old fish, and glue. Be-
sides these physical advantages, he had a tail
which was evidently hot, for it emitted a fizzing
sound when he dropped it into a pool of water,
and once or twice he put it out in the rain to
cool. A phosphorescent light shone all over
him, and when he sneezed he burnt a hole in his
pocket-handkerchief. These two parties ar-
ranged between them for the establishment of
the Republic, and it was resolved that Moreton
Bay was to be stood up on end to run the water
off and thus destroy all commerce, and that
every person who owned any property was to
be split open, and the germs of industry picked
out of him and destroyed. All individuals of
loyal tendencies were to be disembowelled, and
any man who admired Queen Victoria was to
be put in a bag along with eight cats, some
snakes, and a grindstone, and dropped into the
sea amid the cheers of the Shearers Union and
wild applause from the Trades and Labour
Council. The two contracting parties then
jumped for a long time on the remains of the
dead capitalist, and —ent away using bad lan-
guage. This is Hi.; i crier’s story, put into
as coherent langu id ■ as tlie natural incoherence
of that journal wiU allow. It is always a plea-
sure to help the Courier out of a difficulty 4 it
is printed on such thick paper that everybody
likes it.
“A Jerry-Built Constitution.”
That old, useless, fat man, the “ representative
Australian,” has broken out afresh in England
over the approaching —or the said-to-be ap-
proaching —Commonwealth. He has broken
out several times already over the same scheme,
sometimes because the draft Constitution wasn’t
loyal enough, sometimes because it wasn’t suffi-
ciently British in its appearance, sometimes
because it didn’t follow on the lines of that old
constitutional groveller who built up the Cana-
dian Dominion, sometimes because the project
was too long, and at other times because it was
too thin, this time, however, the “represen-
tative kawlinist” writes in the St. James’
Gazette, under the heading: “ A Jerry-built
Constitution,” to complain about yet another
trouble; —
Confederations, Bunds, Leagues, and Covenants, of
winch the world has heard much, have been conceived
and horn in travail and suffering ; sanctified by shed
blood, by resolution, fortitude, and self-sacrifice. Mighty
and famous governmental fabrics, after all, are horn, not
made. No tragic or troublesome elements enter into the
mild caprice for Colonial Federation in the South Seas.
This is by no means a new objection—in fact, it
is getting to be a very old one. A good many
“representative Australians” have lodged a
complaint that there were no “ tragic elements”
on the stage when the Federation scheme was
initiated —in other words, that nobody was.
killed, and no city was set on lire, and that,
there was no horrible invasion with famine and
pestilence behind it to boom the Federal idea
along. And the “representative” mud-head
seems to make no allowance for the fact that
Australia had no “ tragic elements ” on hand at
the moment, barring the torpedo-accident in
Sydney Harbour and the bursting of the big
gun at Melbourne ; and it couldn’t get any.
Apparently the theory is that because most of
the great States of the past started with murder
and fire, therefore it is impossible to build a
new State at any time in the future, unless
murder and the other things are thrown in
according to custom—in other words, the Com-
monwealth won’t hold together unless shells are
bursting in George-street, Sydney, and some
army is getting licked on the Darling Downs.
It was of materials like these that “Confedera-
tions, Bunds, Leagues, and Covenants ” were
constructed, and a horribly bad lot they were.
At least the principal Confederation that we
remember just now lasted through four years
of slaughter, and then died miserably ; and the
Bund that left the biggest mark on history was
a loose gang of several hundred crowned idiots,
and was a hideous failure from beginning to
end ; and the League and Covenant that occurs
to us at the present moment didn’t lead to
union, but disunion, and after 40 years of howl-
ing bigotry in the pulpit and hopeless collapse
in the battlefield, it perished of premature old
age and a rush of misapplied Scripture to the
head. The world certainly “heard much” of
all of them, and it doesn’t want to hear any-
thing like it again. Moreover, the people of
Australia don’t care one rap whether the
world “hears much” about their Corhmon-
wealth or not, for the only things that are much
heard of in history are kings, wars, and sieges;
battles, massacres; wreckage; broken treaties;
and sudden death; and Australia must either
lay in these things or be comparatively unheal’d
of—consequently it doesh’t want to be “ heard.”
The representative Australian has got his idea
upside-down. The “ Confederations; Bunds,”
«&c., of the past were “ born in travail and suf-
fering,” and thfey were such a horribly mis-
shapen lot when they grew up that the
Australian Republic which is coming all
the time, day and night; means to try
the experiment of being born quietly, ill the
hope that it may lead to better results. And
the Leagues ‘ ‘ of which the world has heard
much ” have had just one thing the matter with
them —the world seldom heard any good of any
of them ; and therefore the Australian League
would rather stand out from the gang and
travel on a basis of its own.
♦
The “ People’s Party ” in the United
States.
This is the day of Third Parties in politics; and
still another one has just been born. The
people of the United States have grown tired
at last of the old, useless, purposeless scramble
between Democrats and Republicans —these two
dreary, monotonous factions whose insane
clawings after office never do good to anybody
except the office-holders, and whose policies are
as undefinable as ghosts scuffling in a fog ; and
at a great conference held the other day at
Cincinnati the foundations were laid of a new
organisation, to be called the Party of the
People-. This third section is already so strong
that it seems likely to command eight States at
the next election, and it is gaining new
accessions daily. Its programme is that it cares
nothing at all for Republicans or Democrats,
and would gladly see them all sunk in the
deepest part of the Atlantic—that it won’t
whoop for Harrison or Cleveland, because
the country would be better without either of
them—but that it means to burst up big estates
and wipe out the whole race of millionaires by
means of a graduated income-tax and ponderous
succession duties—that it declares war against
the huge railway-monopolies and demands that
they should be replaced by Government pro-
prietorship—and that it wants a system of
State-banks, shorter hours of labour, and no
more Government by Capital. In short, it Is
the nearest approach to a Labour-party that
has yet appeared in America, and the old Re-
publicans and Democrats are filled with indigna-
tion. They have scrambled for office so long
and so furiously that it has become a recognised
principle that the jobs and the pickings must
belong to one of them, and the idea that the
country may one day do without both of them
is a fact that is too large for their compre-
hension. Each of them has laid down the
principle that when the other gang of brigands
is in the nation is lost, and when its own gang
of brigands is in the nation is saved, and the
mass of the nation is not one cent, better oft
when it is saved than when it is lost. Apart
from the billets and the pickings, and the horrible
language which they throw at each other, there is
no visible difference between a Democrat and a
Republican nowadays. The two parties divided
principally on a question that was settled
twenty-five years ago, but though they both
accepted the settlement, and thus left them-
selves without a single decent point of distinc-
tion to travel on, they have somehow induced
the country to spend all its efforts for many
years in shoving them into office turn-about.
The country can’t tell them apart so far as
concerns any good it ever gets out of them;
and if the “People’s Party grows strong it is
more than probable that they will suddenly
realise that their enmity was a mistake all
along, and that they are both really the same
party and always have been—the Party of
Capital as distinguished from that of Labour
and Humanity. When the People begin to
legislate for themselves there is always a
sudden and unexpected unanimity among their
enemies. The Liberals and Conservatives of
Victoria are so absolutely alike that it is almost
necessary to put a dab of paint on one lot for
the sake of distinction:; the “Great Liberal
Party ” and its opponents in Queensland can
only be distinguished by their clothes:; the
British Tory and the British Liberal are just
as far apart as Smyth is from Smith and no
further; and, until the Democrat and the
Republican start to curse each other, no one
can tell which is the one and which is the
other.
Beaney’s Last Will and Advertisement.
Dr. Beaney’s will is a touching record of that
posthumous charity which vaunted not itself,
and is not puffed up. The four £IOOO bequests'
to Melbourne University (2), Guy’s and St.
Thomas’ Hospitals, go towards perpetuating the
glorious name of Beaney in four scholarships,
£IO,OOO issetapart for the erection of a “Beaney
Institute for the education of Working Men,”
in the hero’s native city of Canterbury, and
sundry personal relics, including two volumes
of “ Men of the Time ” (ye gods !), and a photo,
of himself in fancy-dress (again, ye gods .) are
bequeathed to the said Institute for future
generations to gloat over. Beaney’s Melbourne
tombstone is to swallow up a modest £I2OO of
the estate for certain, but the question of a
further £I2OO tablet in Canterbury Cathedral
has yet to be settled. It is like tins:
Beaney’s will undertakes to contribute £IOOO
to the repairing of that venerable pile on
condition that the £I2OO tablet is per-
mitted to be fixed up to Beaney’s memory m
the Cathedral aisle. The main object of this
munificence is to mix up Beaney with Thomas
a’Beoket and the Black Prince in the minds of
visitors, and it strikes one as odd that the
doctor didn’t devote a large sunt of money
to subsidise an ailnual pilgrimage to
his blessed tablet. Even Beaney, however
entertained doubts as to whether he could
purchase immortality in the oldest of
English churches, for he specially men-
tioned that, if the Dean and Chapter refuse
to let Beaney mend the roof on his own terms,
the £IOOO for repairs and £I2OO for tablet are
to lapse into his residuary estate. The Bulle-
tin fears that they will lapse. Less worthy indi-
viduals thaii Beaney have been favoured with
memorials in Canterbury Cathedral, ho doubt.
But, on the other hand, Great Britain and her
kawlinies are full, of Vainglorious snobs who
would pay tefa times BeanEy’s price for the
little privilege he hankered after. Poor old
champagne Doctor! His former toadies and
flatterers are jeerihg at his “ charity since
they discovered that he has left them out in the
cold. They stand at street corners and curse
his miserable conceit, forgetting that he would
willingly have divided his too-easily-earned
money amongst them colild they have entered
into a solemn undertaking to bawl his name
from the housetops all day long until the Crack
of Doom and present him with an illuminated
address upon the Throne of Grace.

The Full Court and M*. Bnffy.
“ Re a Gentleman One,” as usUal. The other
day the New South Wales Pull Court considered
the case of a solicitor who had been entrusted
with £934 11s. by Cornelius Duffy, and had
stuck to the amount. And after duly thinking
over the situation the Court arose like a giant
refreshed, and the following words issued from
its head >
The Cjurt considered that it would be Very hard if
Duffy were compelled to pay this money over again
owing to the negligence and misconduct of his agent, the
respondent, who had retained the money and evidently
applied it to his own purposes. If the applicant had to
pay this money the second time, it only showed how
essential it was that solicitors of the Court should he men
of the utmost probity and possessing the highest sense of
honour.
The amount of light which a Full Court can
shed on an otherwise dull and commonplace
occurrence, when once it considers the matter
in dead earnest, is really surprising. Probably
no one would have thought of the above facts if
the Court hadn’t mentioned them. But then
suppose, for example, that the attorney, instead
of being an individual who was paid by Duffy
to look after his interests, and on whom Duffy
had a natural claim in consequence, had been a
mere outside practitioner who was under no
obligation to Duffy at all ; and suppose he had
got in at Duffy’s window in the centre of the
night, and fled with £934 11s., and had after-
wards been captured by Officer X. outside ;
and then supposing the Court, instead of rending
the plunder from the Attorney, and sending
him to gaol for five years, had solemnly remarked
that it was very rough on Duffy, and that
the event only showed that people in general
ought to have ’ a high sense of honour, so as to
prevent them burgling Duffy’s premises in the
night; supposing all these things now .

The Advantages of the Gallows.
One day the other week a member of the Victorian
Assembly called upon Chief-Secretary Shiels to
state whether he would introduce a Bill for
enabling condemned prisoners to choose their
own style of execution, just as they are, under
existing arrangements, permitted to put a name
to whatever they fancy for breakfast on the
eventful morning. Shiels threw cold water on
the idea, and pointed opt several objections to
any modification of the one-man-cme-rope
principle which is such an honoured bulwark of
our Liberties. In the first place, explained
Shiels, the death-penalty would be robbed of
much of its ignominy if the prisoners at the
bar were allowed a voice in the matter,
and ignominy is “ an essential element ”
of the wiping-out system, the one great aim of
the law being to make the victim feel as much
sense of moral degradation as possible wflen the
clock strikes ten. Then again, simpered the
waggish Chief-Secretary, whose obvious popu-
larity with the Collius-street girls we used to
envy in times that are no more, “they might
probably find not two human beings would
choose the same mode of execution, and ,tl)e
result would be , that .they would haye to
employ an executioner of varied attain-
ments (a Jack Ketch of all trades, so to
speak) or if they could not get such a personage
they would have to employ a large staff of exe-
cutioners in different styles. Whereupon the
House laughed immoderately at the notioa of,
say, a gross of Nosey Bobs, with power to add
to their,number, and the question dropped with
a dull, sickening thud. Now, although The
Bulletin vigorously objects to capital punish-
ment of any kind, and despises hanging for its
own clumsy sake, no proposal to introduce
variety into the horrors of judicial slaughter
can ever hope to enjoy the consistent support of
.this journal until it publishes “speshul heditions”
at a penny. In that case, The Bulletin might
be glad to compete with other evening papers
in picturesque descriptions of how the shudder-
ing culprit refused to drink the cup of cold
prussic acid he had selected to expiate his
abominable crime, and how his mouth had to be
held open by two sturdy warders whilst the
sheriff administered the fatal draught. It would
also givens great satisfaction to be first in the field
with a gruesome word-picture of the prisoner’s
anguish whilst being burnt alive according to
contract, or of the stolid indifference with which
he met his self-chosen doom of a gash across
the jugular artery. But, in the meantime, we
have no sympathy with any scheme for increas-
ing public interest in executions, or inciting
semi-lunatics to commit murders for the mere
pleasure of giving the world another novelty in
the “ turning-off” way. Shiels didn’t touch
upon the really convincing reasons why the
death-penalty cannot be left open td the discre-
tion of those chiefly interested in it; For
instance, he forgot td remind his honourable but
addle-pated friend that a Judge, after putting
on the black-cap, would have to pause
when he arrived at “ the sentence of
this Court is that you be;” and ask, in h
feeble; apologetic tone of voice — !< What?” Nine
prisoners out of ten would be too much upset
to mention straight away what kind df death
they would prefer; and the relatives and friends
present would start whispering suggestions of a
practical, but painful nature. The tenth
criminal would probably tell the learned judge
to “find out,” or say that he Wanted to be
chucked off the Eiffel To wet With all the
gentlemen df the jury tied round his neck, and
a scandalous scene in Court would naturally
ettsue. Moreover, even after a condemned
prisoner had selected his fate, he would be
continually regretting that he hadn’t gone ill
for something different, and the deputations to
the Governor would become most monstrous;
The present System relieves a condemned
prisoner’s mind of all worry and anxiety. The
Law says he will be hanged, in plain straight-
forward language, and whenpie is hanged it’s
just what he expected all along.
The Oath.
The other day, at Deniliquin (N.S.W.), the
customary Mongolian testifier was in the box
swearing to tell the truth, thfe whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, after the wonted fashion
of an Australian court of justice. Theh thfe
constable; or court-orderly, or some other
official, towed in a rooster to lend weight to the
evidence, and thfe Chinaman proceeded to hack
the head from the unhappy bird in order to
finish the oath and make it binding on his com
science. Next, the partially-murdered fowl
escaped and gambolled madly through the
premises scattering gore and feathers in all
directions, while the heathen witness went
wildly in pursuit in order to finish his
oath and put his evidence on a solid and credible
basis. For, having started to swear on the
mangled bird, it was necessary to finish the oath
before the witness’s testimony could be lawfully
received, and he couldn’t finish the oath unless
he overtook the escaped rooster —consequently,
the course of justice really depended on whether
a Chinaman or a distracted bird could run the
faster. This sort of thing is getting justice
down pretty low, and, in order to make the Law
look a trifle less of a fool than it usually does,
it might be almost worth while to abolish the
judicial oath entirely, whether it is sworn on a
Bible or a fowl, or any other object or substance
whatsoever. Why this old superstition was
ever started it is difficult to guess. It was sup-
posed at one time that a witness who had kissed
an old infected Scripture would be scared there-
after lest he should go to Sheol if he failed to
tell the truth, but the result shows that he
doesn’t care for the alleged danger to any extent
worth mentioning. In every case, large and
small, where evidence is called, the witnesses
contradict each other with a frankness and
vigour that clearly proves one side is lying, and
which does not prove that the other side isn't
lying also. And as, in many cases, the witnesses
are swearing out of pure friendship, and have
not the slightest financial interest in the matter,
it is evident that the world is full of
people who will fake their chance of
,Sheol to oblige a mere passing acquaintance,,
and the man who takes an oath is no more
reliable in consequence of that proceeding than
he would be if he had only taken a drink or an
onion. Moreover, the old formula is mischievous
as well as useless. When a child-witness is put
in the box the Court straightway tests fts
credibility by enquiring -if it knows where it
will go if it violates the oath ; and if the answer
comes in the one word “ Hell,” the evidence is
acceptable—not otherwise. In other words,
the infant that knows about Hell can swear
away the life or liberty of a human being, and
if another infant that doesn’t know about that
same institution is at hand ,to swear in his
defence, it will be rejected, pud the prisoner
might hang as a consequence. Yet horn mop-
sense and experience have long sipeje demon-
strated that the piore an infant Knows about
perdition the less likely is it to Vie reliable, for
instruction on that subject is to de-
moralise any infant; and, inoreover, as neither
the Law nor the Church nor all the colleges have
ever yet proved that there is any perdition at
all, the'legal test of credibility is that the
infant-witness must know a .thing which pro
; bably doesn’t exist at all—iii otljer words, it
ipust lie as a proof that it tells the truth. The
dismal old process is good for three,things only
—it disseminates germs by means of' ancient
Bibles and thus helps the struggling medical
professipp—it furnishes sundry half-crowns for
commissioners of affidavits—and in places where
,Chinese witnesses are plentiful it booms the
chicken industry considerably. But no adult
witness that wanted to lie ever lied any the less
because of his oath ; and as far as concerns the
infant or child-testifier, this crippled supersti-
tion shuts out the only kind of child that ever
does tell the truth—the child who hasn’t heard
about Hell and been demoralised in the hearing.

“ Agitators.”
Now that some thirty or forty vigorous
“ agitators ” have invaded the New South
Wales Legislature, the monopolist press has
toned down a good deal in its language, and
the epithet at the he:td of this item isn’t heaved
with anything like its old regularity. This
sort of thing makes The Bulletin feel sorry.
As far back as the oldest inhabitant can

of infamy that could be heaped on any human
being ; when he didn’t mind being called a
cannibal, a Hottentot, or a parricide, this final
insult was fired at his head, and if he proved
to be proof against that, then language was
exhausted and the dictionary was used up.
The old,; tired expression has been thrown at
Jesus Christ, Paul, Peter, Barnabas,
Luther, Mahomet, Savonarola, Rienzi,
Hancock,- Wilberforce, John Huss, Tren-
With,Gladstone, the Four Evangelists, the
Shearers-’ Union, the prophet Jeremiah,
Knox ; Fitzobert, the “ King of the Poor ”;
Kossuth,- Jack Cade, Wat Tyler, Parnell,
Garibaldi, and everybody else who has been of
any use to mankind ; and the Labour-party has
grown so used to it that they will feel the want
of the old curse when it falls into oblivion. For
it is no small honour to Fitzgerald and Han-
cock and their colleagues, that they should be
cursed by the modern capitalist with exactly
the same anathema that the ancient capitalist
discharged at the great Redemeer in Judaea ;
and, surprising as it may seem, they rather
like it. Nobody ever did any great good to
this world without being an agitator of some
description. Nobody ever did a great action
without causing agitation among that class
which hates greatness, and detests action of
any kind, and whose only ambition is to be an
imported peer, and to stagnate in the same old
swamp in which its ancestors stagnated in the
days of primeval ignorance. Nobody ever
started a new idea without agitating somebody.
No one ever abolished an old abuse except by
being an agitator. The extinction of Pagan-
ism iu Europe, the abolition of slavery,
the destruction of the Inquisition all
were carried out by agitators. It was
a race of objectionable agitators who wiped
out depotism in England by means of
two. revolutions—who overturned the Bourbons
in France, and the throne of Bomba in Naples,
and who led to the disuse of the rack and the
thumbscrew and the wheel and similar things
that would have existed yet but for persistent
agitation. And the agitators who did these
things looked just as small and as commonplace
before they succeeded as Hancock or Fitzgerald
looks to the S.M. Herald to-day. Time and
distance make all the difference. Even the
Herald speaks respectfully of Kossuth, and
yet he was only a more violent kind of Han-
cock a long way off. The bloated Argus des-
cribes Grey as a “ venerable mischief-maker ”
and a “demagogue,” yet Grey is only a new
edition of Rienzi or Garibaldi under altered
Circumstances, and because these two great
Italians are both dead, and were a great dis-
tance away when they were alive, the Argus
looks on them as two respectable patriots. An
“ agitator,” in short, as the term is used by the
capitalist press, is a live patriot, and a patriot
is a dead “agitator,” and a hero is an “agita-
tor ” who is deader than a patriot. And,
therefore, the Labour-party does not feel
obliged to the organs of wealth because they
use their old curse a little less frequently since
the New South Wales election came off. The
Labour-party rather liked the curse than other-
wise. It wants to see the aged anathema going
ahead again in all its pristine vigour, and if
it doesn’t go ahead there will be trouble. This
is not meant as a threat, but as a friendly warn-
ing. Unless the Herald denounces the Labour
members as agitators and demagogues sometime
within the next week, something will happen to
that paper that will make it feel sorry. And
if the Herald or the Courier or the Argus is
found using terms of commendation about these
same Labour members either now or hereafter,
it will have cause to wish it had never been
born. The Labour-party doesn’t want to be
commended by any of them.
Twenty-five members only wore “ bell-

People are beginning more and more to
wonder why N.S.W. Postmaster-General O’Connor

N.S.W. Orange celebration this year, most of the
old and vulgar archpriests of the order having

wicked workmen, who have at last come to see that
the poor old Pope is a bogie man, out of whom a
lot of political impostors have made fortunes.
At a dinner last week, Dan O’Connor was
much chaffed by some Melbourne men over the
fun indulged in, at his expense, in re the Bern-
hardt reception. Dan got angry, but smiled all
the same. “ Look here,” sez he, “ whin next Oi

Dear Bulletin, — While cheerfully recog-
nising the fact that The Bulletin’s chief mission
on this sublunary sphere is to heave angular frag-
ments of “Plain English” at the heads of all
erring wanderers from the straight and narrow
path of democratic rectitude, I hardly see why
you should waste any ammunition of that sorb
upon your friends. That little yarn about my
having dined with Premier Parkes is one of the
many°fairy tales so industriously circulated of late
by interested parties, who handle “ Truth ” with
the most culpable negligence—not to put too fine
a point upon it. But it is really rather rough to
see The Bulletin following suit. I have never
received, much less accepted, any invitation to
partake of the hospitalities of Hampton Cottage
(or Villa—which is it?), and the alleged “little
civilities ” to which you refer are of an equally
imaginary character. If the par. had appeared in
any averqgo relia(r)ble journal, I should have let
it Jk. j.iov but as our crowd have a way of believing
anything that comes from The Bulletin office, I
must ask you to kindly “back down.”—Yours, in
the Cause, Frank Cotton.
[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, July 15, 1891.
My Dear Mooracinua
With an approving smile, Yours Ever rises to compli-
ment Sydney society on the twopence-coloured appear-
ance it presented at the Sara B. pri’aniCre at .Her
Majesty’s on Bth inst. Of course, there were one or two
“ little rifts”—one woman in red velvet and pink silk and
tawdry gilt lace looked Evangeline-y, but, on the whole,
the crowded d.c. and reserved stalls were up to date sar-
torially. The“'Etham” theatre party in the V.R. box
included Lady Charles Scott—in a black gown draped
with pink chiffon,—and Lord “ Precedent” Scott, one of
the ladies in the party wearing the best-looking diamonds
in the house. The handsomest dress in the circle (worn
by the worst-painted woman) was in salmon-pink silk
beautifully smocked and shirred and gauged on the
bodice, which had long Mandarin sleeves of pale-blue and
pink brocade interwoven with silver tinsel. Myra Kemble
(who doesn’t aid her resemblance to Sara by sliding eye or
copied coiffure) wore black with cluster of pink and cream
roses; Carrie Swain, pale-blue satin and diamonds. A
good many tinsel brocades were sported, and when the
light w T as turned on as Madame made her first entrance (a
good managerial idea, to let her see the imposing crowd
in front) the frocking made the “preserved” seats look
very gay and festive.
Contrary to other experiences, the rags are the last
things one gasps about at Bernhardt’s performances, and
I was only vaguely conscious in a hypnotic sort of way
that in the first act of “Camille,” the lady whom our
most distinguished politician has taught us to call La
Bella Frongsay, wore a pale • yellow silk gown
covered with cream silk muslin, with train of silk fancy
tartan in pale harmonious tints, held at the waist by a
jewelled clasp; blouse-fronted bodice, with trails of
yellow flowers from the left shoulder to the right hip, and
white feather-fan slung on to the right shoulder with
bows and ends of broad white satin ribbon (it’s well to be
precise in describing a little easily-copied trick like this).
She also wore her own henna-dyed hair, arranged in a
very sober manner, giving the effect of a “cropped ” top-
knot beginning to grow. In Act 2 the bodice and train
were of shrimp-pink, covered with white net designed in
crystal bead flowers, with two long ends from the front of
the bodice of pink velvet, held at the top with garnet
clasps, the entire front of carubia ottoman silk tied across
with carubia ribbons some inches below’ the waist, short
sleeves of fine white lace, and neck flounce of pink chiffon
—red shoes and hose; her cloak of scarlet, lined with
cream and bordered with red ostrich-tips, was very
handsome. In Act 3 the lady is supposed to have
renounced Worth of Paris, so the gowning was a
simple and artistic garment of cream silk, nicely-
draped on the skirt and contrasted with beetle-
brown silk and cream chiffon, brown hose and shoon.
In Act 4, the—well—disrobing of one of the company
agitated all the opera-glasses within range, and really, I
couldn't help holding my breath at the possibilities of the
landscape if one of those sleeves had slipped. It certainly-
showed the local low-tide corsage the way, but, as excuse,
the culprit had a pair of white and dimpled shoulders. La
Bernhardt herself bounded across the horizon in pink silk
covered with chiffon silver spangled and trimmed with
silver lace, train of black silk, falling unattached from the
waist lined with pink and edged with pink feathers, the
dress tied in round the hips with three bands of black
ribbon ending frontally in a bow and ends caught with a
silver clasp, pink feather fan hanging by black and pink
ribbons from the shoulder, and a mazy array of
“ diamonds ’’—though I really don’t know whether they
merit turned commas or not. In Act 5, the realistic
death-scene (could anything be more natural than the
peevish punchings of the pillow, the restlessness, the
listless endeavour to put her arm into the sleeve of her
mantle ?) was played out in a white muslin robe-de-nuit
with over-robe of white, edged with white swansdovvn.
During the evening numerous floral designs and
bouquets were handed up to the leading lady, and
altogether the Bernhardt premibre was a big gun.
Just as rekerky and crowded a house faced the first
Bernhardt staging of “La Tosca” on 9th inst. as on the
palpitating first night—with the difference that the
applause was louder and more hysterical than on her first
appearance—proving that the Queen of Tragedy has a
good grasp of the Sydney public. Her dresses didn’t help
her much on this occasion. Compared with Copyist
Cora Brown-Potter’s magnificence, Sara suffers from
collar to hem, but, then, her drapings are part of herself
and don’t keep you figuring how much a yard they
cost, as Potter’s did. In the first act of “Tosca,” Floria
wears a pale-green gown with a floral design in green and
pink slightly looped to reveal a jupe of green and
pink, belt of green ribbon ending in long green and pink
bows’ and ends; little spangled “Tosca” bag (they are
already wearing them in the circle) and monstrously
ugly hat in green beaver trimmed in a Guy Fawkes manner
with feathers in pink and green; the sap-green and
brown shawl passed only once over the arm and still not
slipping off. In the Court scene the fffte frock was of
greeny-drab satin, spotted all over with gold tinsel
flowers and bordered with a deep fern pattern in
gold; the skirt, half showing of white tulle,
spotted in gold, with a border of gold—half of the
bodice being of tulle and half of satin: across the bosom
from shoulder to waist a trail of yellow roses and
leaves, the draperies caught on the right hip with an
emerald-green spray studded with diamonds like
dew-drops ; the hair worn simply in a bunch of hanging
ends at the neck. By the way, in the Court scene (where
handsome and fascinating Mdlle. Mea wears a rich gown
as the Queen) it rather spoilt the final grouping for all the
women to have blonde wigs. In the remaining acts La
Tosca wore the chippiest get-up of them all. The slip
of white satin veiled in greenish Tosca net with a foot
bordering of green maidenhair fern and fringe, the
belt and frontal bow of green ribbon, cloak in heliotrope
silk lined with pinky heliotrope floral silk and edged with
deep bands of ermine.
In the audience the dressing was sprightly, but I
saw one or two bogie women. A ham-fat matron in
black and pink towering over a meek little man was
highly reminiscent of “ Catherine ” Fortescue ; another
obese and stage-obscuring party, in brown and a wild
design in lace chrysanthemums, had a battered butterfly
hanging out of her head at the end of a long hairpin, and
a smifky infant, in pink, was transmogrified into a panto,
mime fay by a sort of crown of glittering diamonds ! By
the way, Duquesue didn’t hook the wavering affections of
the feminine portion of the house as “Scarpia.” “He
isn’t as handsome as Curly Bellew,” said a fair somebody
behind me, and of course that finally settles bis histrionic
hash with the “ V ’’-shaped “coterie.”
As befits an all-wool Russian tigress, Bernhardt’s ward-
robe in “Fedora ” certainly ran away from all the pretty
frocks that went before. The first thrill (doesn’t it seem
rather cruel to diagram these glories, to the probable dis-
content of a feminine community erstwhile feeling quite
brave in veiling and “Libbity?”) had the long .“Bern*
hardt ’ train (i.e., only attached to the waist) in dull
yellow satin with a handsome border of large white
“ snowballs ” and leaves and edged with yellow feathers—
the satin spotted at intervals with yellow flowers with
gold centres, the train lined with brown velvet. The
front of yellow gauze, thickly embroidered with the yellow
flowers which edged the low bodice, the bauds of yellow
ribbon about the hips caught frontally with a diamond
dagger. The second toilet proved even more becoming.
Entering, Sara removed a splendid cloak in blue velvet,
with cape of blue moire edged with gold fringe with
collar of black fur, and lining of blue silk, to reveal a
gown of black jetted tulle with train of black silk, lined
with turquoise blue and edged with black feathers;
the invariable hoop of ribbon round the hips held
with a pearl dagger and some black pom-poms ;
blue feather fan attached by bruise-coloured ribbons.
In the breathless “et Louis rcste chez Fedora ” scene, a
spring-green silk is chosen, covered, sleeves and all, with
ecru guipure, the gown caught round with a ceinture in
gold and opals, the train and one side of the front lined
with green silk, the neck finished with a frill of chiffon.
As it seems de rigueur to expire in white, the last act is
fought out iu white brocaded satin edged with brown fur
over a front of primrose silk veiled in creamy lace, lace
sleeves and Egyptian girdle in dull silver. On (he first
night of “Fedora” (three premieres in succession being
rather heavy on the local daily critics, who were kept up
evolving gushing adjectives until 3 a.in.) the usual dressy
crowd marvelled at Sara’s genius from the reserved seats.
Lady Scott (with the Rear-Admiral) had a bad place at the
side, and wore black with a cream crepe front; Lady
Innes wore black lightened by scarlet poppies; and two
well-known medicos’ wives passed the whole of one inter-
val each with her finger in her mouth.
Not being deeply in a diagramatic mood, I am about to
generalise in a dreamy, poetic tone over the yards
and yards of Oriental stuff which Bernhardt hoops round
herself as Cleopatre—for you can’t call them dresses, and
report says they are fixed on with nothing but pins.
Imagine a nude figure wrapped round iu some effective,
unearthly maimer in cobwebby stuffs of a different hue
and design in each act, but always worked with glittering
gems and gold and silver—in one instance, the webby
fabric drawn Over the flesh-coloured stuff, as if it were
the only intervening layer between Cieo. and the balmy
breezes —a Frenchy effect, causing a great clicking of
lorgnettes, you bet. The rosy pedal digits - painted like
the nails—also roused a little mild excitement in a i
enlightened community, which usually begins taking off
its tilings at the top. Different ornaments are worn with
these glittering swathes. In one scene, her long, hanging,
Indian-red hair is adorned with a silver snake, and waist
and fingers are zoned with glittering “jewels” that savour
of the property-room. In another, trails of very real-
looking pink roses, with a golden zone to accentuate the
pretty fall in the back. All through, Cleo. is draped to
soothing point by Sara, and to attempt to analyse the
tout ensemble, couldn t be done without breaking into
poetry, something l ; ke this :
With the sinuous line of limbs revealed by the veil of gold,
Each lissom turn traced out ’ueath the fabric skilfully
wound.
Draping and beautiful form, each of the self-same mould,
Body and silvery web together as one inbound.
Neat, isn’t it? But I will spare you the other ninety-
seven verses.
Harping on the French dramas, what do the idiots mean
who buy weak Gruudyfled editions of the play and read
them with close attention even when the red-haired
Melpomene (I copyright this term) is filling the stage with
her genius? Why don’t they get them off by heart at
home? or wrestle with them between the acts? What
point is there in knowing just what she’s saying at the
expense of losing the cream of the whole thing—the
facial expression and the acting ? On the first night the
circle at times looked like the reading-room of a
library.
With due natural diffidence I must object to one or two
little points in Madame B.’s make-up as Camille. The
youthful pink of cheek and chin ended so sharply as to
form a distinct line against the white of the neck, and
the effect was mask-like. Also, the painting of the rosy
fingers (nails and tips looking as if dipped in ink) was so
crude as to he quite visible without the aid of opera*
glasses. This may be high Parisian art, but it isn’t
human-nature—Sara’s presiding idol in everything else,
seemingly.
From a feminine point of view, the “at home” and
banquet which signalised the official opening of the
splendidly solid “Australia” Hotel on 11th inst. was a
novel orgy at which a mob of women sat about in the
ladies’drawing-room and listened to the rattle of knives
and forks in the great dining-hall until the speeches came
on. Then a move was made to see how the lions were
feeding, and we stood grouped behind Parkes and Dibbs
and Toby Barton while obliging waiters flitted round with
fizz, and I (at least) drank to the success of the “Aus-
tralia” in the safe shadow of a broad, black, satin-covered
back. I had a capital view of the wise en scene—
especially of the top of old Sir Henry’s head, where the
Southdownish mane is thinning out sadly, revealing
fleeting glimpses of a pink cranium. The tables
were nicely decorated, but lire solid floral mound in
front of Mr, Gorman was irresistibly like a baby’s
grave, and the speeches were dreadfully hackneyed. Light
refreshment was spread for the lady visitors in the “late
breakfast room,” and intermittent music kept them
awake in the drawing-room, where the guests were
received by Mrs. Garran (in black lace), Mrs. Ben. James
(purple velvet and mauve silk), and Mrs. Gorman (laven-
der grey silk trimmed with jewelled passementerie;
diamond ornaments). Major Dane’s future wife was there
in a white gown girlishly garlanded with natural flowers,
and the handsomest dress was a rich ivory-satin brocade
with berthe and sleeves of white chiffon and sparkling
diamond necklace. But what spoilt the feminine aspect
of tilings was that most of the women didn’t know one
another, and as no Australian female ever chums in with
her neighbour (except over the back-fence) without a
ceremonious introduction, a damp and depressing st illness
gave the festivities quite an “ after the funeral ” air.
Sir Charles and Lady Hall 6 farewelled to a splendid
hour*-’ mi Uth inst- amidst a generally-expressed regret
that no extension of the season was promised. Both the
Hallos were smothered in Bowers—the “ knight ” receiv*
ing a crown of violets, though goodness only knows what
use he was expected to put it to. It would have been a
graceful thing had he returned with it on and bowed his
acknowledgments, wouldn’t it ? What really pleased me
with some of the audience on the organ seats was that
when certain bouquets fell on the stage, one or two gentle*
men advanced and picked them up for Lady Halle. It
looked quite like continental courtesy (courtesy is mostly
impudence, by the way, while “ rudeness ” is often only
another name for modesty)—altogether different from the
afraid-to-say-his-soul’s-his-own Australian manner on such
occasions.
The tragical gun-explosion on hoard the Cordelia has
damped the eye of many a Sydney damsel, since the late
officers were great favourites—Lieutenant Hillyar
especially having won his way everywhere on his first
visit last year. Whoever remembers his clever fooling in
the Cordelia burlesque, “ Ali Baba," will remember hi B
husky'gagging to (1 think) Cassim ; “ You didn’t know it
was loaded, in coorse.” The words have a fatal tone
about them now.
Tempo ball, on 29th inst. (rather an unwise, date since
it is the last of the Bernhardt season), is to be under V.R.
and civic patronage, the working committee including
Mrs. Capo, Mrs. Plunkett and Miss Windeyer, with
Mrs. W. F. Brennan as lion. sec. The proceeds of the
hall arc to pay for the laundry-fittings and relieve the
debt on the house and grounds, and it is to he hoped a
full attendance will result. Matrons are often heard to
say that the host servants of all graduate in the uusec*
ku'iaii Tempo Refuge.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Mrs, W. P. Manning, Mayoress of Sydney, will be at

the month in her reception-rooms at the Town Hall.
These are private receptions ; the others will be heralded
in the usual manner.

The wedding of Miss Buchanan, of Kushcutter's Ba 3 -, to
Mr. J‘ Bob ” Buchanan, son of Capt. Buchanan, of Nowra,
South Coast, took place on 7th inst., at St. Mark’s, Darling
Point. Miss Buchanan wore a charming dress of white
faille and chiffon (made by Hordern's in Pitt-street, who
rejoice in an exceptionally good fitter), and was followed
by four maids in cream and gold. Travelling dress in
grey fine cloth, with hat en suite. On the return from the
honeymoon, a dance will be he'd at Needs rooms.
Lodge Gladstone Masonic Ball, at West's Booms, on 7th
inst., was a well-attended festivity, evidently greatly
enjoyed by the participants therein. The pale-blue and
white moire, trimmed with silver, regalia of the Masons
was very pretty, and most of the ladies were brightly and
festively attired. The supper table was draped in white
and scarlet.
A concert, followed by amateur theatricals, was held in
8t John's School-room, Parlinghurst, on 7th inst., before
a very good audience, comprising Judge and Mrs.
Stephen, Miss Consetl Stephen, Captain Eldrcd, etc. Mr.
Eric Morley opened the ball with a pianoforte solo, and
Mrs. Berry Drina 11 -loudly encored in Roeckel’s “Prima
Donna,” gave in response “Two Spoons,” which narrowly
escaped a similar fate. The drama, “True Colours,”
went very well.
Time payment —five years’ hard labuur.

“Great Parkes” the big Sydney Post-
office clock-bell, is now in its place on the tower.
Great Dan, the N.S.W. Postmaster-General, is
now pretty nearly out of his place.
“ Bob ” Smith has resigned his temporary
office as N.S.W. Crown Solicitor, and the staff
heaves a great sigh of relief, for R.M.S. was
a martinet and a glutton for work.
One of the greatest artists of the Sydney
land-boom —the blue-eyed speculator who did
such clever things—has had to call his creditors
together. On paper, he is only deficient £4OOO.
The S.A. labour-leaders endorse the views
of Mr. Charleston, a local M.L.C., who is against
the immediate federation of Australia, on the
ground that the Federal Parliament would be run
in Conservative interests, as only wealthy men
could afford to attend. Then why not make pro-
vision for proper payment of members in the
Constitution Bill?
Harry Stockdale’s Northern Territory
buffalo-shooting expedition leaves Sydney on 28th
per Menmuir, which has had to delay her
departure. Among those who are going are
W. H. Hicks, jun., Stephen Brown (son of the
late Stephen Campbell Brown), W. T. Wright,
of Marrickville, Waiterus Brown, and Marsden
(Branxton). The expedition takes along a photo-
grapher, and means to come back with a steamer-
load of trophies of the chase.
Five country carriers were recently
brought before the beak at Napier, Maoriland,
charged with the awful crime of driving their
waggons on the Sawbuth. They were on their
way from Napier to the inland Pafea district with
goods, and continued their journey on the Sunday.
They were each fined one shilling with costs.
About the same Sunday the Honourable Dick
Seddon, Minister for Mines, and suite, were Hy-
ing across the country by special train. The
Honourable Dick was not fined.
Philanthropist Ardill has got a verdict for
£3OO and costs against the Australian Workman
(Sydney), which bad denounced him as a fraud
and impostor and various other things, and his
adopted niece, Miss Gertrude Williams, has
accepted a plaster of £5O and £BO costs to heal the
wound caused by certain nasty and unfounded
remarks made by editor Higgs concerning her
alleged relations with her adopted uncle. The
Workman simply hadn’t a shadow of a legal case
and rested its defence on the irresponsible cackle
of one or two old women. The whole thing is a
caution against amateur journalism.

Aquarium Bondi.
Outside Sydney Her Majesty’s on Bern-
hardt’s opening night seethed a street-jamming
crowd, thatafterwardsburstthrough the vestibule’s
scarce-open gates, trampling down the leaders
who stumbled, to storm the ticket-offices with the
urgency of conquerors just entering a long-
beleaguered city. By seven o’clock the theatre
was crowded except in reserved portions (all the
stalls were reserved except three back rows), and
the close-packed gallery (not vocally disposed to
■emulate Melbourne in the matter of the Marseil-
.laise) kept itself in spirits by singing “ Annie
Rooney ” and the “ Bogie Man,” only leaving off
to cheer Carrie Swain and other favourites, poli-
tical and theatrical, as they entered the
•circle. The curtain having risen to the
traditional three thumps of the Porte St. Martin,
the ovation that greeted Sara on her entry was a
•thing for recollection. She responded in the mode
■so much written about, ere rapidly doffing the
Bernhardt to don the Camille. This reminds us
that the S.M. Herald's late critic has, so far,
■avoided comparisons with Mrs. Potter; although
tie previously stated that the B-P’s slavish replica
was superior to the Bernhardtian original.
Superior, yes, just as the pulings of a love-sick
girl are to the passionate ravings of a goddess.
■Sara, the sinuous, in “ Camille,” as in “La Tosca”
■and “Fedora,” disarms criticism. She magnetises
•you from the first, and even the long waits (much
shorter, by-the-way, than those of Melbourne),
.and three o* 1 four curtain-raisings after each
.act, fail to break the spell. She is not
•an actress but an enchantress; you cannot stop
to enquire why she does things after a certain
•fashion, or if that fashion be the right one.
The mere fact that she adopts a certain mode makes
•that the right one. There is no hesitation about
her, no pause; as an American critic puts it:
“Celerity of action, both physical and mental,
supplies the fascination which attends Bernhardt.”
She is not supported by any great actors or
-actresses, but they are all artists, even though
'some of them look as if they’d come to Australia
to wear out their old boots. Up to date people
have been most strongly repelled by the Armand
•and Cavaradossi of Fleury. An actor whose
rgait is as sloppy as his garb; he might try
,putting his knees in splints as a cure for
-ambling. Angelo, Bara’s juvenile lead ten years
-ago in London, is a lumpish de Varville,
;and the quarrel scene with Duval was not
.-so well done as in the Bellew season.
-Piron’s fine enunciation and artistie ways, espe-
.,-ially as Duval pere, have made him a great
• favourite, just what the unctuousness of Muuie’s
• humour and breadth of style have done for him.
!Du jnesne’s Bcarpia is a fine performance, but not
-so faithfully conceived as that of Bellew. A chief
-ofipolice should be secretive, restrained, cynical,
■ full of reserved force and quiet intensity. His
Tpanoff was fine, the pathos of his cry, “Ma
■mire,” conclusive. Mine. Grandet s Prudence is
younger, quieter, and not so hungry as of
■former exponents. The Queen in “La Tbsoa ”of
Mdlle. Mea was harmonious and stately, while
tthe Comtesse Olga in “Fedora ” of Mme. Gilbert
<was clever in another way ; but the blonde of the
•beautiful bosom, who sat at the head of the card-
rtable in “ Camille,” took the opera-glasses
■off Sara even. The French don’t seem to
i pay the same attention to scenic detail that
■we do in Australia. A pair of palms, a
bearskin and some cane chairs, followed Sara in
'“Camille” from canary-cage to salon, thence to
ilove in a cottage, and finally to death in a garret.
iS'J'or are they, apparently, partial to slow music.
:By the way. Bellew’s condensation of the two
-.scenes in “ Tosca’s ” fifth act was a distinct im-
provement.
•# ■# •
The cash returns for the first four nights
:iare stated to be greater than during a eorrespond-
■ing period in the Marvellous City. So far
■audiences have followed Sara through her won-
drous enunciations of an unknown tongue with
u-apt attention, nor have they failed to listen
quietly to the other members of the company.
The only exception to this rule has been provided
'by folks who attend apparently to study French,
and who prefer to conn their guide-books to hav-
ing the dialogue interpreted for them by watching
the facial expression of the world’s greatest actress.
When several hundred persons turn over leaves
simultaneously, it wafts us back to the days of
school-tasks and prayer-meetings.
* * *
“ Cleopatra,” put up on Monday for six
nights and a matinee, is locally voted quiet, and
•considered to be more of a spectacle than a play.
The Cleopatra of Bernhardt is very graceful and
very charming, but lacking in that majesty which
is essential to the pourtrayal of the queenly and
classic. The scenery, particularly that of the
terrace at Memphis, is fine, but shows consider-
able signs of wear and tear. Darmont’s Antony
has not created a sensation, and the ladies con-
sider him a trifle long in the neck for a profes-
sional beauty. It is not known yet when
■“ Pauline Blanchard ” will be staged. By the
way why do they make Sara’s performances,
already not followed with ease by most folks, less
understandable, by omitting all mention of where
the scenes are laid from their programmes?
** * *
Flying from Justice,” by the author of
‘“Turned-Up” and the adaptor of “The Pick-
pocket,” is a chaotic and incomprehensible
crudity, interspersed by hackneyed situations that
were intended to be sensational, hung on lines that
were meant to be humorous or striking, but are
merely silly and hysterical and pervaded by
characters who resemble nothing in the heavens
above on the earth beneath, or in the waters under
the earth. The murders in this drama are
numerous, and it seems probable that the author
would have slain all his creations in the first act,
had he not started out to construct a four-act
abbatoir ; he therefore prudently saved up a
few victims for the last act, which ends hurriedly
with the death of everybody and the arrest of the
remainder. “Flying from Justice” is_ not a
fashionable piece, and so the dress-circle at
Sydney Royal has not been over-filled since it was
.put up, and the few who do drop in there usually
drop out early, “flying to drink” to alleviate
their miseries. The stalls, however, have been,
so far, well patronised, and the gallery has
been crowded out by the melodrama lovers of
two houses. The leading parts are handled by
the Brothers Rignold, Harry Jewett, Jack
Sweeney, Jim Hazlitt, Joe Tolano, Stirling
Whyte, Frank Hareourt and Arthur Greenaway,
with the Misses Bland, Tracy and Watts-Phillips.
Nevertheless, nothing very complimentary can be
said about any of them. For this all-round lack
of excellence, weakness of opportunity is doubtless
responsible. The scenery is by Geo. Gordon, and
the play is likely to run for some time.
* * *
At Sydney Garrick “Our Flat ” still sur
vives, for the very sufficient reason that there is
nothing in hand to replace it. The management
are still hopeful that it may yet hit the public
taste. Nothing new can be said of the show, ex-
cept that Polly Emery (Mrs. Diver) has been com-
pelled to resign the slavey’s billet for maternal
reasons and that Maggie Knight fills the vacancy
satisfactorily. The little lady is said to be doing
well.
« W f
Rumours have been circulated aneut the
secession of a popular American comedian, from
“Evangeline,” still doing tremendous business
at Sydney Criterion. Rumour, however, is usually,
if not always, a liar, and this latest theatrical on
dit is doubtless as little to be believed as any
other peripatetic falsehood extant. On Saturday
evening “ Lone Fisherman ” Harris, diving from
a rock after whales, strained the sinews of his
ankle, and Charles Perry, under-study, had to
take his place, Harris has since returned to duty.

Air and fire have entered intp a cpinpacfc
to ruin water. The week before last a cyclone
tore Coogee Aquarium up by the roots; on
Saturday evening a conflagration levelled Bondi
Aquarium Hall to the ground. The latter build-
ing, the property of the Assets’ Realisation Co.,
was insured for £5OOO. The Chinese epicure who,
according to Charles jLanib, burned houses down
for the purpose of revelling in crackling, has beep
outdone by this expensive mode of providing
boiled and fried fish. Joking apart, however,
everyone will be sorry for Alfred Wyburd, whip
has been dogged by bad luck and who has
worked like a slave, night and day, to make Bondi
a payable speculation. Until the main building
be re-erected, entertainments will be given on the
lawn from a temporary structure,

Sydney Sunday concerts are popping up
all over the place. Every Sabbath evening
melodious sounds may be heard per medium of
collection at the Standai’d and Alhambra, and
now the Darlinghurst Rink —erstwhile sacred to

tainment, while Fred. B. Norton has broken out
into vocal management at Newtown Trpcadero.

Bland Holt’s well-balanced company, aftejr
a week’s spell in order to allow the appearance of
the “ Divine Sara,” have again taken possession
of the Adelaide Royal, and “rung” up “The
Golden Ladder ” with satisfactory results. Bland’s
excellent scenery is in marked contrast to the
worn-out rubbish used during the Bernhardt
season, and the acting has been fully appreciated
by the Adelaide public. Bland Holt is ably sup-
ported by Kate Bishop, Walter Howe, Albert
Norman, "Glover, Baker, and others. For the last
week of the season “ Never Despair ” will be pro-
duced for the first time in the Australias. Tommy
Hudson, with a very creditable show, is doing
excellent business a* Garner’s Rooms. J. L,
Lohr is at present in Adelaide on a hurried visit
to his wife.

The Ireland benefit, writes “Dramaticua” to Thb
Bulletin, suggests to me—why, 1 know not, or, perhaps,
Ido know—the stage loves of the past, meaning the real
ones, between actors and actresses, known to everyone
behind the scenes; and I will say, without any dis-
respect to the present era, that in the daysof Rosa Dunn,
Julia Mathews, Rose Edouin, Kate Ward and Fanny
Oathcart, the stage of Australia possessed many pure and
true women. One romance floats before my memory
where the brilliant actress preferred the steady, middle-
aged manager to the ardent leading man, and she was
happy. Another where the extremely well-known,
respected, and wealthy manager would have given any-
thing for the hand of the leading lady, but she preferred
the leading juvenile, and they were unhappy. Apin,
where the leading lady disappointed all the professional
danglers by marrying into Collins-street, and they were
as happy as doves in a cage. Again—but never mind the
seamy side, suffice to know some are finishing well.
The senior partner of the legal firm of Elliston and
Featherstone, Hobart, is a grandson of Elliston, the great
English comedian, who flourished about the beginning of
this century. The family all strongly possess the theatri-
cal instinct.
Walter Montgomery was, on his first arrival in Mel-
bourne, elected an honorary member of the Melbourne
club, for the usual term in sucli cases, one month, but he
was not re-elected. The members generally complained
of his “ noise.” He would stay up all night gambling
with Captain Standish and his “What ho 1 Waiter, bring
me another flagon,” was enough to unstring the nerves of
all the old gentlemen of the club, while the sheep lords
and wool kings, who did not know Shakespeare from the
Bible, were entirely disgusted at what they called his
“ ranting,”
J. C. Williamson bids fair to become Australia's
Augustus Harris. J.C., who is now untramelled with
partners, is at the present time running Sara Bernhardt,
the Gaiety Company, the Royal Opera crowd, “ Our Flat”
Company, and a Juvenile Opera Company (in Tasmania).
Henry Meyer, a notorious and wealthy Viennese snob,
lately offered Wolter, the famous actress, 10,000' florins to
kiss the end of her dress. She consented, took the money,
and then took him to a room where dozens of dresses
were hanging on the walls and said, “There, kiss anyone
of those you like I”
The music-hall men seem to die off a lot faster than
matriculated actors, who, for their part, are anything but
three • score - years - and - tenners in a general way. George
Fredericks, “ a Loudon comique ” and afterwards the pro-
prietor of a little hall of his own (until he betted it to
blazes) has gone to join Leybourne, Fred. Coyne, Pat
Feeney, and a host of similar fast-goers, on the Golden
Shore. Rickards, who has “ played for safety ” and not
hung around the London bars all his life, is one of the
very few “ stars ” of 20 years’ standing. It would be in-
teresting to hear ’Arry lecture upon the lives and deaths
of comic-songsters he has met.
Editor Bulletin,— As the widow of Marcus Clarke, a
brother journalist of yours id an old Bulletin
.contributor, I seek your co-operation in letting
the public know the facts in regard to the
several dramatic versions of mr late husband’s
novel, “ His Natural Life,” now being played throughout
Australasia. Although 1 hold, in conjunction with
Messrs. R. Bentley and Sons, publishers, London, a legal
right in the novel in question, and, therefore, in any
dramatised version of it, as recently settled in hnglana,
I reap no benefit from the stage-productions given of it,
except in one solitary instance, namejy, from Mr. Alfred
Dampier. And it is in justice to his honourable action in
the matter, and in defence of my rights, that I am sending
this statement abroad throughout the Press of Australasia.
1 may add that I would take steps to prohibit the appear-
ance of the many unauthorised and illegalversions being
played here and there, but am advised that the companies
producing them are so. ephemeral, financially speaking,
that it would only mean waste of money. And therefore
it is, I now make this appeal to, you, and I respectfully
ask all journals to help me by publishing the facts as here
given. -—Yours, Marian Clarke. Melbourne, July A, 189,1.
Sara Bernhardt refused to leave Adelaide by steamer at
the last moment. All the trunks were on board, and the
mastiff arranged for, when Sara arrived in her brougham.
An inspection of the cabin settled it; and, stamping her
foot, she intimated her intention to return to shore.
Abbey’s protestations were in vain, and all the trunks
Avere disembarked. They say Sara took umbrage at the
treatment of her mastiff on the trip from Melbourne to
Adelaide. Suggestion for minstrel farce : “ Ruled by her
Pup.”
Somebody conceived a very happy idea when Bernhardt
was playing “Adrienne Lecouvreur” in Adelaide. This
play contains the fable of “The Two Pigeons.” Bern-
hardt chose this selection for recitation when, as a child,
she appeared as a candidate at the Conservatoire, v\ hen
she reached this part of the play and had finished reciting
the lines, one of the “gods” liberated two pigeons
carrying a basket of flowers, and the birds flew quite
gracefully to the stage. Bernhardt was for a time
non-plussed, and seemed delighted at this graceful
compliment.
Madame Simonsen has seen our old friend Signor Dond*
in Italy. He flourishes.
Jolly, .drollest of French comedians, died theotherday.
He created the part of Pomponnet in “ Madame Angot,
and sp it happened that Composer Lecocq’s conception of
the barber, a sentimental noodle with a sweet tenor voice,
was changed into a bounding buffoon. Jolly being unable
to sing for sour apples, the beautiful air written for Pom-
ponnet, in the second act, was cut out of the score both
in Paris and London. The English versions reproduced
the barber on Jplly lines, and still denied him his melody,
although at the same time—the time when everybody had
“ Madame Angot ” on the brain—a travelling French
company were making it the great feature of the opera in
Madrid.’ Pomponnet’s romanza, or whatever the musical
jargonists call it, was recently heard at Melbourne Opera
House, during Nellie Stewart’s reign, to the astonishment
of old stagers who thought they had all the “ Angot
music by heart. Alfred Plumpton, having got hold of
the original Lecooq score, persuaded Nellie to sacrifice
low comedy on the altar of harmony and give the part of
Pomponnet to young Jules Simonsen. With a light tenor
voice just suited to his task, he sang the long ostracised
air charmingly.
An innocent voung Melbourne newspaper man
“ Pattie Browne is really great as‘Polly Ecoles. I remem-
ber seeing Marie Litton in this part a good many years
ago, but I think Pattie would compare favourably with
London’s erstwhile pet comedienne.” The chances are
that the Bohemian boy had “got ’em again” when he
saw Marie Litton play Polly Eccles. That late-lamented
lady was of the slim angelic order, and would never have
been known as an actress but for the fact that her hus-
band (Wybrow Robertson) was theatrically inclined, and
“ ran ” her into notoriety. She did eventually blossom
into a manageress, producing old English comedies, with
Kyrle Bellew for leading man, and so forth. But, remem-
bering her face, figure, and stage career, The Bulletin
can’t imagine that Litton played Polly EColes, and will
solemnly swear that she never was “ London’s pet come-
dienne.” No, the callow critic was thinking of Mane
“Wilton,” the original Polly Eccles, and his favourable
comparison of Pattie Browne with the inimitable Mrs.
Bancroft may be excused on the ground of ignorance,
arising from the fact that he never saw that now elderly
lady. Mrs. Bancroft has been the victim of'comparisons
far’more ludicrous than this. Pattie’s style is well within
measurable distance of the greater artiste’s. Melbourne
Bulletin, a monstrosity which has long been dead and
forgotten, once likened Alice Deorwyn to the real “pet
comedienne ”.of days gone by.
It was funny to watch Sir Binjy Binjy and William
Clarke, Bart, “doing” the Bernhardt season at Melbourne
Princess’. Gracious Heavens! how they did suffet, to be
sure.
Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd were chorister-boys,
ditto our own Armes Beaumont. But then they were not
made to screech soprano solos after their young voices
had commenced to break, a cruel practice which accounts
for the ordinary choir nightingale becoming a vocal cross
between a raven and a handsaw when he reaches maturity.
A London paper describes Christine Nilsson’s figure as
resembling an equilateral triangle, an idiotic simile in-
tended to explain that Christine is very much embon-
point now-a-days. Yet she was slim and spirituelle
enough when she first set up as a rival to Patti, that won-
derful little woman who has been singing away at the top
of the tree whilst dozens of other nightingales have had
their respective days and disappeared. By the way,
Patti’s splendid state of preservation is a nasty jar for the
medical moralists who swear that there can be no health
in a married woman if she avoids having a family. 11 is
to be presumed that the Queen of Song, like many other
gold-coining artists, has foregone the joys of maternity
for financial considerations.
“The Gondoliers” has just concluded a run of 18
months at the Savoy Theatre, where “ The Nautoh Girl,”
minus Nellie Stewart, was due on June 13.
Fred Terry is to be “lucky man ” at Julia Neilson’s (the
original “ Dancing Girl ”) wedding.
The OomCdie Francaise have just been appearing at the
Royalty for three weeks, changing the bill every night.
Touching this very brief season of French plays, a
“home” paper remarks One would have thought
that M. Mayer had had enough of London theatres and
London audiences, or rather want of audiences.” Mayer
used to make money years ago—he was the first to bring
Divine Sara across the Channel—but of late the cockneys
won’t have French plays at any price. Ask Abbey, who
dropped a heap of money over “Joan of Arc” at Her
Majesty’s.
Talk about your Ninon de I’Enclos ! Would she dance
like Ellen Farren at fif—ahem !—teen ?
London fashionable paper; “No party is modish now
without an actor.” Just so, Sugden amid the Desarts.
Madame Simonsen fetches a ballet. Hope she consulted
Judge Casey.
Why can’t Sara’s big dog learn manners from Rignold’s ?
When the other big dog comes out of quarantine there’ll
be a row.
The Ireland benefit is well under way, in Melbourne,
with Stewart as secretary and Williamson’s hearty support
as master of the Dramatic Association.
Rosnati is thought the best Italian tenor who eve?
visited Australia, but he was such a frightful gorger. At
dinner, the anx-.etv of the troupe was to prevent him
swallowing more than two geese or turkeys, for then
good-bye to Come e Bello.
Baroness Burdett Coutts was the main support of the
recently-deceased Edwin Long, who painted for her life-
size portraits of Irving as Hamlet, Richard 111., and
Vanderdecken, and, inasmuch as he has long relinquished
those parts, it indicates the time when she was so sweet
on Irving, before their mysterious breach.
Sara Bernhardt is always changing her pets. No sooner
out of one pet than she is into another.
Since he ran Von Finkelstein and the devout Santley, R.
S. Smythe has become quite serious. The perennial smile
is no longer there. In London he attended several of the
May meetings—amongst them the Derby.
Mary Moore advises budding actresses who wish to
.make a hit to play Ibsep. “ The characters are so splen-
didly drawn that one has only to speak the lines and walk
through the part to make a great impression.” A neat
“ drive ” this for some local rival.
Ada Ward has had no luck since her return to London-
Emma Chambers, who seems to have “caught on” in
England, is now monopolising the leading part in “ Jane.”
There has been no soubrette in Australia since she left,
except, of course, the inimitable Pattie, who will be
getting spoilt for want of a rival.
Dramatic art in England is suffering severely from the
crowd of amateurs (more or less) who, having money, are
able to elbow real talent out of the way. Something of
the same sort has been seen here. Anyone can be a “star”
who can afford to pay for his own printing.
Some people prefer Mrs. Bernard Beere’s Fedora to the
Bernhardt creation, and the divine Sara has an idea about
this; Fedora is always more effectively (played by a tall
woman.
Pieces of Sarah Bernhardt’s repertoire not acted in
Melbourne, “Ph&dre,” by Racine. This classicality
was much desired by her, but the management were
justifiably nervous. “Le Sphinx,” by Feuillet, adver-
tised, but withdrawn. “Franoillon,” by Dumas, greatly
fancied by Bernhardt, but condemned as too thin, talky,
and Frenohy.
The wife of a prominent member of the Gaiety Co., now
in Australia, avers a London paper, is about to seek per-
mission to divorce herself from her husband.
“ Should actresses marry ? ” We should smile ; look at
the ads. they get in the divorce-courts.
Woodford, who won the ’Frisco “sleep-fastingcontest,”
with *.20 and the “championship,” was forced to retire,
after 158 hours and 48 minutes wakefulness, by the
management’s doctor, who declared him in danger of
losing his reason.
Sims Reeves’ series of farewell concerts extended over
11 years.
There are not.a few benighted creatures who think Mrs.
Potter was finer than Bernhardt, and probably about as
many who consider “Evangeline” much “brighter” than
“ The Gondoliers.”
Heard at “ Cleopatra ”in Melbourne. “I say, mister,
when is she going to sing?” “Sh, she doesn’t sing.”
“No? I thought all them blooming foreigners sang and
did the high-kick bizness.”
Coppin and Sullivan are said to be in a difficulty re a
theatre in Sydney to run in conjunction with Melbourne
Royal. Sydney has plenty of third-rate temples, but at
present can only boast of three decent theatres. Names ?
Charles Warner has left London and gone to the pro-
vinces. Ah well, never mind. Australia is not so far oft'.
Sydney High School will hold its usual half-yearly
dramatic entertainment on Friday, July 17, at Sydney
Standard.
Fred. B. Norton travels with pantomime in the pro-
vinces at Christmas, taking with him everything but the
audiences.
Myra Kemble has purchased the travelling rights of
“ Jane ” from B. and B. “ Jane” and “ Dr. Bill ” ought
to run well in double harness.
The two Sydney morning dailies differ widely on a
matter of fact. The Telegraph says that Bernhardt
closed the third act of “Fedora” with the usual “Ah!
Jetc tiens !” The Herald says she purposely omitted
these words. Granny was right for once.
Charles Taylor has sold the Sydney, Melbourne, Ade-
laide, Brisbane, Hobart and Launceston rights of his
London drama, “Never Despair,” to Bland Holt, Avho
produces it first in Adelaide.
A correspondent writes to inform us that Janet Achuroh
played to crowded houses at Wagga on 6th, 7th and Bth
July.
A Miss Mildred Birch, of Sydney, a mezzo-soprano, is
studying music in Paris under Mme. Mackenzie.
Sir Charles Halle says that “ if the Australian public
do not like high-class music, they are the best actors
he has ever met with.”
Mr. and Mrs. Abbey left for America per Alameda.
Willoughby, who went with them, will manage the new
Fifth Avenue, where Bernhardt will shortly play a 13
weeks’ season. She opens at London in April.
The Sydney newspaper-owner who wagered £lOO that
his rag could ruin a certain play now running to big
houses, has paid over the money. Newspaper critiques
don’t influence five per cent, of audiences. It’s the first
night audience’s reports that make or mar a show.
At a Melbourne performance of “A Doll’s House,” an
alcoholised bushman present gave vent to a denunciatory
whoop and informed the stage-artists that their conduct
was immoral, and that they were poisoning society with
false notions about marriage. Forty-shillings or seven
days.
A new comedian from the continent, one Grattan Riggs,
is at present sojourning in Tasmania. It is whispered
that he has up his sleeve the scrip of a fresh blank verse
tragedy, with which he intends to astonish the w'orld
shortly. He calls it “The Irish Detective.”
The Bondi Aquarium has been destroyed by fire, the
damage being estimated at £5OOO. This ought to be the
last straw for the insurance-coni panics, who should now
be full of skating-rink risks. i *
One Jude, in Melbourne, makes the harmonium talk.
A waft comes across to us from the well-known Agrati,
circus agent, South America, desiring to hear from the
boys.
' Longest run ever known in Melbourne, “ Tambom
Major,” 100 nights ; the next, about 80 nights, or a little
over, lies between “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” and a Royal
Pantomime. -
‘ ‘ Patience ” was the first production of the Triumvirate,
Melbourne Royal, with Alice Rees, Andr6e Navaro, Verdi,
Vernon, Riccardi, Forde, and Beaumont in the cast.
The stars of the new Simonsen Opera Troupe, for Aus-
tralia, are Signor and Signora Cuttica, tenor and prirna
donna, regarded as a magnificent pair of brilliants.
The policy of the Melbourne Triumvirate, with the old
Princess’, was to keep it shut, but the new Princess'
killed the Royal—for them. The Princess’ has paid
magnificently, with everything, hardly such a thing
known as a bad house, but then the Phirm had to run out
the other lease.
Three eminent musicos have decided to come to Austra-
lia, in a few months: Marie Roze, Edward Lloyd, tenor,
and Paderewski, the Polish pianist, crack of the hour.
Costume theatrical football match in Melbourne last
week. The old gag—lot of supes. People go expecting
to see the great Billy Elton, and only see little props.
Coppin was in Caple’s book-shop, Collins-street, when
he heard the news that Brooke was drowned in the
London, and felt like Napoleon, at the news of his French
fleet being destroyed by Nelson, at Trafalgar,
Williamson and G. complain they have no<, come well
out of Melb. Royal, and blame the fickle public, but we
have pointed out how they tried the impossible game of
Chatterton and Webster in London, managing different
theatres in one city. ’Twill smash Gus. Harris.
D’Auban was the dancing-master of Sylvia Grey, Lefty
Lind, and the Gaiety Sacred Lamps of Burlesque.
Coppin says the excitement over the Royal makes him
young again—but he alw’ays was, the Napoleon of Austral
drama, "lleard it before, have you ? But another genera-
tion has arisen since you saw- it in print, and know' not
Joseph, that’s to say George, the George, heavy father of
all the Rignolds and Darrells, and somewhere about
nephew to George the First, on the Norfolk Circuit, where
young George fiddled in the orchestra at 8 years old, as
his w’ell-preserved portrait still show’s.
When Cooper and Bailey’s show’ came to Australia, their
biggest-billed deception was “ Behemoth ! On earth there
is not his like. See Book of Job. He was brought across
the Sahara Desert in a glass tank by camels.” This
turned out to be a miserable little agouti, or South
American river-hog, about four feet long, in a tank. They
pretended the giraffe was alive, but it was stuffed, and
mechanism wagged its head ; Titania, the magnificent
big female elephant, died in Auckland, through eating
the keeper’s monley-jacket, with phosphorus matches in
the pocket. She was towed to sea, and fishermen reported
on her as a miraculous whale.
Danby’s hit at Bernhardt and the long waits, goes as
well as anvthing in “Buy Bias.” This clever fellow was
torn away from a great London success, his costermonger
duet, in “ Joan of Arc,” with Arthur Roberts. He will go
in to’ rival Leslie, Lonnen and Roberts.
Snazelle is travelling round again with his songs, reci-
tations, yarns, and dissolving views. Maoriland will
shortly be apprised of the circumstances under which
The Leper was cleansed, and Bill Adams won the Battle
Of Waterloo.

POLITICAL POINTS
Payment of members is Democracy’s key
to Parliament.
A lot of Victorian M.P’s. object to the
term Commonwealth. “ Republic ” is much
better.
The leading newspaper of the Anglican
Church, in Melbourne, this month says British
Monarchy is not a necessity.
Sir Julius Vogel, writing to a Maoriland
paper, objects to either an Australian or an Aus-
tralasian Federation as conducive to Separation.
Memo, for the Australian Labour-party :
“A political party without a daily paper of its
own is like the Salvation Army without its big
drum.”
“ Atticus,” in the Leader, says that the
Anti-Federation party in Victoria “is made up
of Sir Bryan O’Loghlen, and, even then, is divided
in its opinions.”
“ Who and what are the People V’ asks the
S.M. Herald. Why, mutton, and bricks and
mortar, and vacant allotments, and rooms at the
clubs. They are the People.
They are inducing President Carnot to
visit England. The exact right thing, but his
reception would be almost enough to blow the
Tory Government out of office.
Parkes, who rarely sticks to a beaten man,
holds on to Dan O’Connor simply because he
considers it impolitic to risk a seat by making a
fresh selection at this critical juncture.
The Cobden Club is on its last legs.
“Their creed has not gained, but has steadily lost
ground even in England, the first of nations to
embrace it,” says London Standard.
“ Rather than see Australia a Republic, I
would pray to God Almighty to send me to the
nethermost hell.” —Mr. Array tage, M.P. for
Grant, Vie. Well, then, to hell with Army tage !
‘ ‘ Are we to see our wives, Mr. Speaker,
instead of cooking our dinners and mending our
clothes, spending all their time in reading the
Blue Books of this country?”— Fish M.P. (N.Z.)
William Ogilvie’s essay on the “ Rights of
Property in Land,” first printed in 1782, and said,
with Dove’s essay on the subject, to be Henry
George's source of inspiration, will soon ’ be re-
issued by a firm of London publishers.
When men no longer possess the confidence
of their constituents they no longer represent their
constituents. That is sufficient answer to those
who sneer at the terms on which the N.S.W.
labour-members hold their Parliamentary posi-
(ions.
Hugh Mosman, the new Q. Legislative
Councillor, makes only the third North" Queens-
lander nominated to the Bananaland Upper
Chamber. Three out of 40; and, in the Lower
House, 17 out of 72. No wonder the North howls
for Separation.
The big defeat sustained oy Parnell's
nominee at Carlow does not necessarily show that
the Irish priests have of late gained any real
access of general political power. It only goes to
prove that they still strongly influence their people
in regard to questions of sexual morality.
S. J. Way, tlxe B.A. Chief Justice, told
the Londoners that Australians werb quite as
loyal as Englishmen, and pointed to the Soudan
as a “noble example.” Way carefully omitted to
refer to the execration heaped by present-day
Australians on all who were concerned in the
business.
In “Eight Hours’ Day,” Sydney Webb
and Harold Cox state that machinery, “the
demon of man’s own creation is the final justifica-
tion of State interference. “If,” say they,
“ machinery lowers human beings to the level of
monkeys, we can at any rate limit the period of
monkeydom.”
Parkes, The Bulletin surmises, reckons
on keeping in office on either or both of two
questions—Payment of Members and One-Man-
One-Vote. His game is to bogusly and pro-
tractedly quarr.el with the Upper House and,
throwing over all unpopular colleagues; travel
along with his tongue in his cheek as People’s
Champion.
The associated Pastoralists’ Unions boast
that they are unconquerable. They are allied to
the Employers’ Unions and to the Steamship
Owners’ Association. They vaunt that any
squatters who remain outside their organisation
will never be able to get a bale of their wool to
market. They claim that theirs is the Samson of
commercial unions.
It is now made plain that no English
capitalist will be so mad as to establish ironworks
in N.S.W. without Protection against the world.
The N.S.W. morning press, which tried to prove
that the local iron - industry would boom with
Freetrade, is now diligently engaged in proving
that it would be much better to have no ironworks
in N.S.W. after all.
National Advocate (Bathurst) advocates
the formation of a Country Party in N.S.W.
Parliament. How many parties in all? Let’s
reckon : Parkesians, Dibbsites, Labourmen,
Borderers, Backblockers, and Countrymen. To
say nothing of Freetraders, Protectionists, Fair-
traders, Prohibitionists, Local Optionists.
The S.M. Herald declares that the 48
Parkesians in N.S.W. Assembly were returned
by 86,260 voters; the 56 Dibbsites by 66,360
voters; the 30 Labourmen by 58,000 voters ; and
the Independents by 13,600 voters. Not at all.
The S.M.H. uses the word “voters” instead of
“ votes,” and that makes all the difference. The
freat majority of the plural voters pluralised for
’arkes & Co.
John Hancock has made a promising start
in the Victorian Assembly by announcing that
he “hates the sight of a soldier.” The House
ought to have responded with a unanimous “hear,
hear,” but it didn’t, which was evidence sufficient
that the Cabbage Garden is in dire need of fresh
elections and a strong Labour-party. A Labour-
party with no unhealthy desire to put their legs
under Hopetoun’s mahogany, you understand.
Sydney D.T. talks of the “ brilliant
triumph” of Parkesian “statesmanship” as
shown in the “virtually unanimous endorsement”
by N.S.W. of his principles of Federal Union.
Who ever denied the abstract advisableness of Aus-
tralian Union ? An equally brilliant “ triumph ”
on this score could have been scored by a deaf
and dumb blackfellow. The fact is that Parkes
went to the electors on his (i.e., Griffith’s) Con-
vention Bill and got thoroughly licked.
The Electoral League of Orange, N.S.W.*
in an address, reminded the newly-elected “Jupp”
Gardiner that he was about to take his place in
“halls made famous by the genius of a Went-
worth, a Dailey, a Martin, and a Deniehy; by
the unselfishness and ability of a Robertson, a
Parkes and a Dibbs.” Why blemish the con-
junction with Parkes only ? What in the name
of Saint Michael and George has John Davies
done that he shouldn’t be wedged in ?
ENCOURAGING.
MR. NOEAR : “Do you think my daughter will ever be a musician, Professor? Now, tell
me candidly.”
PROFESSOR: “I gant say, sir. She dell me she gome of a long-lived family.”
It is cabled that the Morning Post—a
flunkey organ owned by V.R.’s ennobled toady,
Sir Algernon Borthwick Bart.—commends the
action of Melbourne in forming “a National
Association to preserve the national character of
the Legislature.” If the aforesaid Association
(still in embryo, by the way) is to realise Borth-
wick’s notion of the term “ National ” it will have
to be a male Primrose League with Hopetoun as
Perpetual Grand Knight of the Order, or some-
thing like that.
Sydney Echo, which says what its mother,
the Sydney Morning Herald, tells it to say, but
dares not say herself, seeks to arouse “ Christian ”
prejudices by challenging religiously heterodox
and Republican labour-members in regard to the
oath of allegiance. The labour-members have
read history and have before them the example of
Bradlaugh, which is a sufficiently good precedent
for them. The oath of allegiance is at presen t forced
upon all members of Australian Parliaments, and
it being a matter not of free choice but of com-
pulsion, it will be swallowed whole with a snigger
for the necessary end that people of the Echo
kidney may be prevented from monopolising
Parliamentary representation.
Dear Bulletin,— A word in reply to Mr. Mit-
chell as to his letter on the Socialists’ position. It is
admitted that the appropriation by the State of all annual
value of land as proposed by George would completely
nationalise the land. It is also admitted that Capital is
wealth which is used in the production of wealth, and
which takes the form of machinery, tools, and other instru-
ments of production. It will be also admitted that land
is the ultimate source of all wealth. Land must there-
fore be the source of all capital which is a form of wealth.
Therefore, nationalise land and you nationalise Capital. If,
by a stroke of the pen, we could nationalise land to-
morrow, it does not follow' that all machinery, tools, in-
struments of labour— i.e., existing capital—would be
nationalised—it would have to be replaced from that
source of all w'ealth, the land then in the control of the
State, or nationalised, as we call it. Does the State
Socialist want more than this?—Yours, A, G. H.
Queensland Labour Commission laid two
eggs—a majority-report by six female and six
male members, and a minority report by six male
members only ; the former ideally theoretical and
the latter mostly practical. Nevertheless, the
latter contains this oddity :
That compulsory closure of all shops at a stated hour by
Act of Parliament is as contrary to the spirit of British
freedom as was the curfew law, against which and similar
oppressive enactments Englishmen successfully struggled
in the past.
The comparison made is odious. Curfew was an
enactment against the people’s comfort—opposed
to the worker’s leisure. Early-closing is for the
benefit and leisure of the toiler. Melbourne has
tried it after a variegated fashion, and doesn’t
seem to be over-slave-bound by it, either.
The Orange N.S.W. Electoral League
holds that —“Labour is God’s greatest and noblest
gift to man.” Question. Isn’t toothache as noble
a gift as backache ? Labour is such a grand gift
that everybody who can do so refuses to use it.
Even the Orange E.L. wants to limit this
“greatest and noblest gift” to eight hours per
day—on the principle, we suppose, that one can
have too much of a good thing. Can’t the O.E.L.
refrain from talking unsanctified rot ? Even th
Bible, which is often enough queer in its phil-
osophy, sets down Labour as a curse. Down to
now-a-days the man who labours gets all the
kicks, and the loafer who doesn’t, gets all the
ha’pence. We can fairly look this “gift horse”
in the mouth.
Doctors Bergmann and Halim, Berlin,
coolly confessed, last week, that they had experi-
mented with cancer-lymph on human incurables.
Here you have the cynical admission than an
hospital is only a place where the poor are experi-
mented on for the benefit of tire rich.
Mr. H. Valentine Haynes has been
delivered of a pamphlet which he styles—“ A
Machiavellian Solution of the Australian Labor
Problem.” Haynes’ cure is mainly to fire out the
army, which is good enough as far as it goes, but
is bluntly Herculean rather than Machiavellian.
Mr. and Mrs. Jewell were survivors from
one of the Auckland Islands wrecks, and Jewell
became a stationmaster on the Gippsland railway.
They carefully keep as mementoes the dresses of
skins they wore many months on the islands.

starving Adams.

The Flying Gang: A Railway Song
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Oh, I served my time in the days gone by,
In the railways’ clash and clang,
And I worked my way till the end, when I
Was the boss of the flying-gang.
’Twas a chosen band that was kept at hand
In the case of an urgent need,
Was it South or North, we were started forth,
And away at our utmost speed.
If a word reached town that a bridge was down,
The imperious summons.rang—
“ Come out with the pilot-engine sharp,
And away with the flying-gang !”
Then a piercing scream and a rush of steam
As the engine went ahead;
With a measured beat by the slum and street
Of the sleeping town we fled.
By the uplands bright and the homesteads white
With the rush of the Western wind—•
The fastest engine in all the yard,
And a single truck behind—
And the country children clapped their hands
As the engine’s echoes rang ;
But their elders said, “ There is work ahead
When they send for the flying-gang.”
Then aoi’oss the miles of the saltbush plain,
In the moonlight wet with dew,
Where the grasses waved like the ripening grain
The pilot-engine flew;
And the order sped on the wire ahead—
“ The Pilot must go through.
The Governor’s special must stand aside,
And the fast express go hang;
Let your orders be that the line is free
For the train with the flying-gang.”
BANJO.
Milan, of Servia, lately squeezed out of
his Ministry a cheque for £60,000 on a Vienna
bank. On presentation the bank confiscated it
for an outstanding debt. Jawbone Neild, of Syd-
ney, will sympathise with Milan.
If the sheep of N.S.W. were so improved
as to produce fleeces worth only Is. each more
than at present—and this has been proved to be
easily possible—it would mean an increase of over
£2,500,000 per annum in the province's wealth, or
above £2 per head of the population per annum.
At Naseby, Maoriland, a crowd surrounded
a hotel containing abook-canvasser and ‘ ‘ demanded
that he should be given up to them, but the police
managed to get the door closed and a suggestion
that the building should be burnt down "was not
acted on.” It would have been a pity to throw
away a good hotel thus.
A Baltimore U.S. physician lately willed
to his relatives silver phials to contain his ashes
after cremation. Which reminds us that the
authorities cf the big London crematorium com-
plain that they can’t get people to remove from
the premises the ashes of their relatives.
Great Truths.
Great truths are very simple truths when
finally they are comprehended; but it takes a
long while to prepare any mind to comprehend
a great truth. For years one may grope in
darkness concerning some phase of his spiritual
life, or some perplexities of a sacred friendship,
or some seeming contradictions in his inner-
most personal character ; when suddenly a
light will break in upon the mind, or upon the
heart, which instantly makes clear that which
before seemed hopelessly dark. A great truth
is then perceived in its bearings upon, and so
in its explanations of, all that was bewildering
and disheartening to one who was in ignorance
of that truth. What a new sense of life and
hope comes with such a new recognition of a
comforting or of an enlightening great truth.
In the joy of an experience like tliis, one can
wait and trust in other perplexities which may
yet be similarly resolved and dissipated. Thus
it is that on the introduction of Clements Tonic
everybody wars sceptical of its merits ; yet now
so popular has it become, and so reliable has it
proved itself, that hundreds of bogus medicines
are placed on the market with which to gull
the public. Every genuine article is always
imitated, and people will always try to impose
on the credulity of their suffering fellow men.
Patients must be on their guard against these
swindlers, for their remedies are perfectly use-
less, and while time is being wasted, the disease
increases, and perhaps even beyond the power
of so potent a remedy as Clements Tonic. Mrs.
Brand, of 33 Australia-street, Newtown,
Sydney, writes : “ I think it my duty to write
in grateful acknowledgment of the great benefit
my mother has derived by the use of Clements
Tonic. My mother was severely ill from in-
ability to eat and general debility ; and in fact
her condition caused us great anxiety ; we had
a great repugnance to using patent mediciea,
but the numerous cures we heard had been
effected by Clements Tonic, and which was
corroborated by our personal friends, induced
my mother to try one bottle. The effect of this
one bottle was marvellous, her appetite has
returned, and her health wonderfully improved.
We never thought it possible that so great an
improvement could have been effected in so
short a time. You may make what use of this
you like, as we are sure there must be many
sufferers, who like my mother, would derive
immense benefit by the use of Clements Tonic.
I am yours gratefully, Evelyn Brand.” Care
must be taken that the genuine “ Clements ”
Tonic is obtained, as the use of imitations must
lead to disappointment and regret.

B. L. Farjeon (since distinguished as a
novelist) was the original business manager of
Maori laud’s first daily paper, the Otago Daily
Times, which started publication loth November,
18(51. Julius Vogel was editor.
biins Reeves’ real age is 72, not 69 as
stated in his autobiography. Some literary detec-
tive has unearthed the entry of his birth in the
legistry of Woolwich parish church. It is time
Air. Reeves came to Australia.
It is stated, on what looks like good
authority, that the Princess of Wales uses a pre-
paration of onions to make her hair grow. Onion
on the hair is about six times as conspicuous as
the same vegetable in the breath.
It is related that when the chief of the
Clan Chattan lately described himself in the
visitors’book at a hotel as “The Mackintosh,”
another gentleman of the same name announced
himself as “ The other Mackintosh.”
Living near Liverpool (N.S.W.) is a grand-
son of the Lawson who, in 1813, crossed the Blue
Mountains with Wentworth and Blaxland. This
gentleman keeps an extensive poultry-farm, but,
from accident, has been blind from infancy.
Sara Bernhardt humped her little coffin
over to Adelaide with her. During “La Tosca”
she put all her floral tributes in it and lay down
in the casket beside them for a short sleep between
acts, much to the consternation of poor old Wybert
Reeve.
Writes a Bulletin London correspon-
dent ;
Lord Carington does not play so low as he did in
Sydney, and he rather fights shy of his quondam Sydney
“ pals!” As an instance, I don’t think F.W. has ever
been inside his doors, and the chaff he makes about W.L.
and some of the old parasites is quite lovely.
Gladstone’s deceased first-born, W.H.G.,
who died of chloroform during an operation (or
died of an operation during chloroform), had a
pious horror of his awful dad’s advanced prin-
ciples, and was said to weep over his strong
personal resemlolance to the Grand Old Man.
Mark Twain shortly visits France, incog.,
with his wife. “We are going,” he says, “ away
somewhere to some quiet place, where no one
knows us, to enjoy each other’s company.”
From what we are always reading in the papers,
it takes a real humourist to enjoy his wife’s com-
pany.
The “bloody” Chief-Justice Jeffreys once
said to a pert lady-witness; “Madame, you are
too quick.” To which.she retorted: “Not half so
quick as your wife.” Then a great silence fell on
the court, for folks were afraid to laugh in the
presence of the terrible Jeffreys, whose wife had
added to the population two months after mar-
riage.
It now turns out that our recent visitor,
the late Sir Robert Fowler, was noted for some-
thing besides his old-fashioned plaid pants and
his habit of stuttering through amateur sermons,
and that was his habit of yelling “Yah, yah !”
when he heard anything that pleased him. This
ho was wont to do so long and vigorously that
strangers feared apoplexy.
Nellie Farren is a little younger than Sara
Bernhardt, but has grandchildren, all the same.
“Now, does she look like a grandmother?” was
the question put by a well-known actor, standing
at the back of the Princess’ circle, when Nellie
made her rentrde in “Ruy Bias.” A resolution
to the effect that she looked more like her grand-
child was carried unanimously.
The widow (just dead) of General Sir
Edward Macarthur, who came to N.S.W. as a
boy with his father, John Macarthur in 1790, was
a sister of General Neill, who fell at Lucknow in
the Mutiny, and Colonel Neill, who was killed on
Punt-road, Prahran (Vic.), by a vagrant cur rush-
ing at his horse’s heels. Lady Macarthur left her
immense Pyrmont properties' to Mrs. Onslow, of
Camden, N.S.W.
Massingham, who made the London Star,
has been badgered out of it by the capitalists who
have bought into it since it succeeded, and who
insist on no moi’e identification of the paper
with the New Unionism, let alone Solialism.
Massingham has now got Davitt’s London
World, and people are waiting to see what he
will make of it.
Mr. F. Call, as P.M. at Melbourne, once
had before him an alleged quack doctor, charged
with illegally practising without a permit, and
fined him £lOO. The quack instantly flung a £lOO-
- on the table, and another £5, remarking that
the latter was for the “ poor-box.” Call got indig-
nant, and thundered out, “Do you mean to
express contempt for the court? ” “No,” meekly
responded the quack, “No, your worship, I may
feel it, but I can’t afford to express it.”
During President Carnot’s recent tour in
the South of France he received, among other pre-
sents, an alpenstock, a horse-whip, a scale and
weights, a dogskin-waistcoat, a three-legged foot-

“Is that newspaper indecent?”
“No, sir,” said the youth, struck by the seraphic aspect of his customer, and at once pull-
ing out a copy and proffering it to the good old man. “ No, sir, not at all.”
“Ah,” sighed the dear old man, as he straightway turned on his heel and walked sadly
and slowly away, mournfully pondering on the wicked deceptions of this weary
world.
stool, a mule, a pair of wooden clogs, and a pound
of butter. Not much, altogether, but still things
might have been worse. For instance, Carnot
might have been a N.S.W, Foreign-trade candi-
date, and then he would most likely have got the
sack, one old, dead pussy-cat, the father of all
eggs, and a hoarse yell.
Sir Andrew Clark, it is cabled, wouldn fc
go to Spurgeon because Dr. Kidd had been there—
Disraeli’s homeopath, Dr. Kidd, who used to
provide the miraculous Pills of Paradise, which
galvanized the brilliant Hebrew’s corpse to make
three-hour Speeches in the House of Lords, on
“The Key of India is not Herat, but London.”
We never forget the tableau—Sir Andrew Clark
called in to see George Eliot. He drew aside
the bed-curtain, gazed on that noble brow, and
exclaimed, “ Moritura! ”
Another anecdote of Gerard Krefft. Dr.
Benj afield went lecturing round with a snake-
antidote, and was expatiating to a select assem-
blage, at Sydney School of Arts—or somewhere—
when the cry rose from the boys at the back,
“ Here’s Gerard Krefft! ” So Gerard, with the
inevitable gunny-bag under his arm, was passed
from hand to hand, till he bounded on to the
platform. “ I say, Doctor, do you say you’ve got
an antidote for snaag-bides? ” “ Yes, certainly.”
“Den try this one ! ” And out it came waggling
from the bag. The Doctor vaulted to a top shelf.
A southern paper relates that at a Vic-
torian bush tea-meeting at which Bishop and Mrs.
Moorhouse were present the small building was
crammed to the doors and the low platform on
which the speaker sat was also invaded. A young
fellow, attired in striped shirt and moleskins, but
adorned with a flaming red “comforter,” the ends
of which were stowed beneath the waistband of
his trousers, slouched up to a form on which a
plainly-dressed, comfortable-looking woman sat,
and giving her a nudge with his elbow, said,
“Would you mind shoving up a bit, missus?”
“ No, no,” cried the local clergyman ; “ you must
not sit there ; that is the bishop’s lady.” “Non-
sense !” said Bishop Moorhouse, who sat next his
wife, “ squeeze up a bit, Mary.”
Writes a Bulletin London correspon-
dent :
Edgar Ray, once of Sydney Punch and afterwards of
London Tomahawk, is irrepressible. He is now the
secretary and manager of a London company which
undertakes the winding and synchronising of clocks. He
is quite a reputable member of society, and his daughter
has made a good match. Did you ever hear the story of
his being asked to dine at Henry Moore’s, whom he did
not know, and turning up at old Mr. Want’s house, at
Potts Point, where he was also a stranger? Want, who was
the most hospitable man on earth, thought that perhaps he
was a friend of one of his sons who had forgotten to keep his
appointment to entertain him, and so he was made welcome.
Edgar was a cool card, and though he knew he was in the
wrong house, did not believe in hunting farther, so he
waited. When dinner was over, he calmly turned to the
host and said : “ I believe I have made a mistake, and
have come to the wrong house.” Mr. Want replied, “I
think so, too ; but never mind if you have enjoyed your-
self.” And so the matter ended. Edgar loved “ good
society,” and never really had his heart in the Tomahawk.
W. 0. Grasby, an Adelaide (S.A.) jour-
nalist, has written a pamphlet showing up the
S.A. Education Department for its sweating of
Public-school teachers.
Mr. J. I. Marshall, the well-known Sydney
Arcade dentist, has forwarded to us one of his
works on Artificial Teeth. It is very well written,
and ought to prove useful to any of our readers
who are interested in the subject.
W. Y. Smith, the Adelaide criminal
lawyer, defending a client the other day, referred
to the “freedom of British subjects.” Said
Pater, P.M. : “Talk about British freedom
That is a mere phrase! Britain at the present
time is slaving the people of every small country

Walking with Browning, in Paris, Carlyle
noticed an image of the crucifixion. Glancing
towards it, he said, with his deliberate Scotch
utterance, “ Ah, poor fellow, your part is played
out.”
The cable states this week, with its wonted
vigour, that “the report that Prince Ferdinand
of Hohenzollern, heir-presumptive to the Crown
of Roumania, had been betrothed to the Arch-
duchess Maria Dorothy Amelia, daughter of the
Archduke Joseph Charles Louis, cousin of the
Emperor of Austria, is officially denied.” The
Bulletin officially remarks just here that this
sort of thing is tommyrot, and it doesn’t matter
one turnip whether it is “ denied ” or not. Rou-
mania isn’t much of a kingdom, anyhow—it’s only
a spot; and Ferdinand’s show for the crown
doesn’t amount to much, and it isn’t of the slight-
est interest whether he gets a crown or a corn;
and nobody in Australia knows Maria Dorothy
Amelia from Moses ; and Joseph Charles Louis is
only cousin to a family of lunatics, and it is to be
hoped that he enjoys the billet. And if Ferdinand
had married Maria to-be-oontinued-in-our-next it
is just possible he would have been sorry he did it,
for quite possibly the lady kicks in her sleep owing
to her name lying heavily on her chest; and then he
might have thrown dishes at her ; and, if so,
they are better unmarried; and, in any case,
nobody at this end of the cable cares whether they
are married or not, or whether they are both
smothered, or whether there ever were any such
persons at all, or whether Joseph Charles Louis
is cousin to an emperor or an elephant. It makes
us feel tired, and that is about all.

REMINISCENCE OF THE KELLY TIME: VERY
SUITABLE AT A POLITICAL CIRSIS.
The Kellys were out and so was I. It was funds
I was out of, and I was padding the hoof from
Melbourne. I shall not take the trouble to prove
that I was much younger in 79 than I am in ’9l:
I was, and that’s enough. I picked up a brother
swaggy at one of Big Clarke’s stations ; he was a
shocking bad cadger, except for tobacco, and of
that he did not get a smoke until I said, “ Let me
ask the next cove and see what luck I’ll have.”
Just then a swell came along, and I touched my
hat and addressed him thus: “Excuse me, sir,
but this here mate of mine has tried every soul
for a bit of ’bacca for the last eight miles. They,
none of them, would give him even an old dog or
the dottle of a pipe. For goodness sake give him
a pipeful to stop his jaw, I’m sick of his whining,
and I don’t smoke. It’s a beastly habit.” Now,
strange to say, the gentleman burst out laughing
and said that I was a brick, but that he had no
tobacco. “However, here’s a shilling. Just on
ahead is Chloe’s Swamp. Buy your mate a fig and
have a drink for yourself.” Off he rode. Then
my mate abused me like a scab-shearer for insult-
ing him, but I tramped on towards the beei’.
Entering a pub. I found that I was still within
the range of threepenny drinks, so I had
a pint, left my swag in the bar, gave
the insulted man sixpence, and proceeded to
explore. J ust then a poster caught my eye :
“Vote for Fiddler, the People’s Friend,” and
again another, “Vote for Parson and Liberty.”
Theseare assumed names, as I fear Sir William
Breezier and libel. Then I turned to my friend
and said, “You wait here and watch the swags,
I’m off to get cheap beer.”
In those good old days there were open pubs for
the clients of the candidates. So I drank to
Fiddler, the coffee and spice-grinder, and to
Parson, who is now a nice, respectable Minister of
the State of Pigtoria ; then I repeated the doses
and went back to see my friend. I was not
drunk, only beery. My mate had explained to a
policeman that we were hard up and were making
up-country, and I find that I also had explained
to another policeman in mufti that I was off
to Goulburn. You cannot imagine how kind my
trap was. He was the sergeant, and offered us a
shake down in the lock-up, which we took. He
shouted half-a-dozen times and asked us a hundred
questions, always eyeing my mate’s concertina-
case and a parcel I had in my hand. It was hlack-
pudding. They gave us a candle and the news-
papers. They even told us that Fiddler or Parson
was at the head of the poll. But they drew the
bolt on us at night, and I could hear my friend, the
Sergeant, sending off and receiving telegrams.
Still, we slept the sleep of the tired and beery.
In the morning we were asked how we slept, and
the police gave us three shillings to get our break-
fast and laughed at the concertina and sausages.
They said they were disappointed in us, because
they hoped to sell us for a couple of thousand
apiece. Complimentary !
I forget how I headed this yarn. Oh,
yes ! I’m a bit of a brigand, and I was once a
Christian. There was a crisis in those days : a
fair and square beer and whisky political crisis.
What the gambling den is a crisis? Anyway,
crisis beer is as good as any other sheoak. It’s
scarce in this here crisis—worse luck.

Umslopoghaas, the Zulu companion of the
late well-known journalist, D. C. F. Moodie, is
now a miner on Broken Hill. He has married a
white woman and is a happy and proud father of
four piebalds. By the way, Moodie did not walk
from Adelaide to Melbourne (as we notice most of
the papers saying), but went there by steamer,
for the occasion of caning the late A. T. Clark.
Melbourne Clubmen got up a purse for him, as a
token of their “loyalty,” and the overland walk
was the journey back to Adelaide.
Editor Bulletin.— Sir,- I can scarcely hope that you
will publish this, because it is an adverse comment upon
one of your would-be witty items. In your present issue,
11th July, you have a very Spiteful paragraph about
“Bagmen.” Now, I had an idea that you had a “down ”
upon our craft, on account of an ill-judged resolution of
the C.T.A. anent your “ Jubilee ” number. But I did not
think that your bilious attack was so bad ; and I trust to
that “spirit of fair play,” of which you boast, to get at
least a show. Only one very ignorant of N.S.W. com-
mercial travellers could have written the paragraph in
question. Anyone conversant with the “roads” knows
that, as regards the “ pie ” business, we usually come in a
very bad second to squatters and their satellites, com-
mission-agents and bank-clerks. As to the Bruce Smith
incident, only a new-chum traveller would take the
trouble to write to you about such an ordinary occurrence,
as one of us, who pay, having to stand aside for a dead-
head M.L.A. Impartial inquiry would prove that we are
the Railway Commissioners’ best customers, and most
entitled to consideration. As to the “snag” business, I
venture.to remark that it is lucky for the Hon. B. S. that
he did not encounter one of our “ old warriors,” or he,
might have “struck the snag.” As one of the oldest
travellers, I write “as one having authority.”-Yours,
Semper Paratus. Sydney, 10th July, 1891. [We are
afraid the drummers understand none but their own
jokes.— Ed. B.j

How vain even clever men may be of
petty titles was illustrated a few days since in the
case of Rudd v. The Commissioners of N.S.W.
Railways. The recently-knighted “Sir” Julian
Salomons, Q.C., was counsel for the Commis-
sioners. and having occasion to refer to himself,
observed : “ My learned friend in reply may say,
‘ The argument of Sir Julian was to the effect
that’” , &c, “Sir Julian’s” learned friend
did reply, but always alluded to the little knight
as “my friend.” Which reminds us of a story of
another N.S.W. knight who stopped the ’bus at
Rushcutter’s Bay, a few days after his title was
announced, to tell the green grocer in a loud voice
from the box that Lady wanted to see him.
*' * *
A just-arrived Englishman, an Oxford
graduate, by the way, who had been walking
round Sydney, dropped in at The Bulletin
office one day last week. “Tell me,” he said,
“who was this Albert the Good to whom you
Sydney people have erected statues, and so on?
Was he in the meat-preserving? Pardon mj
ignorance, but we hear very little of your great
Australians in our country.”
* # •
That night in the last short session of the
N.S.W. Parliament, when the Speaker’s casting-
vote saved the Government from defeat, cards
were being- vainly sent in wholesale to members
by those who desired to view the proceedings. At
last a messenger approached Minister O’Connor,
cardin hand, but was rebuffed with a “Don’t
bother me, sure the House is full, I can t look at
it.” “But this,” persisted the attendant, “is
from the Marquis of Huntley.” “What!”
shouted the P.M.G., “the Marquis of Huntley!
Why didn’t you tell me that before ? Where is
he?” Then the Jaynial Dan elbowed his way
through the corridor to the crowded corner where
the mysterious Marquis kept a group agog.
“ Delighted to have the distinguished honour
of ” —1 said he, then broke off shortly to remark
in an aggrieved tone, “ Tom Huntley, you divil,
you’re always at your thricks.” “The Marquis
of Huntley” is better known as Tom Huntley,
prominent Sydney butcher.

The committee of the English Bar have,
it is cabled, resolved to discourage the practice
of sons who are barristers appearing in
courts in which their fathers are presiding
judges. And while the English Bar Com-
mittee are about it, they will, on the same grounds,
have also to discourage the practice of sons-in-law
appearing before their fathers-in-law, also judges’
nephews appearing before their uncles. In Aus-
tralia, we have contrasted the son effect with the
son-in-law effect and find that the latter “takes
the cake.”
■t # #
It is hard to see, however, what can be
done in the matter. It by no means follows that
the son of a clever judge is bound to be a bad
lawyer, Then, as to judges’ legally-successful sons-
in-law, there is no law to prevent a barrister from
falling in love with a judge’s “elderly ugly
daughter,” and it is to be presumed that a wise
judge, so far as he can control such affairs, favours
the love-suit of the cleverest aspirant.
* # #
The conduct of attorneys prima facie cer-
tainly lends colour to tiie nasty insinuations you
so often hear concerning the partiality displayed
by the Bench for its professional relations. Where
is the attorney who, when his case comes before
his Honor, loses any opportunity of “pleasing”
that functionary by giving his son or son-in-law,
or nephew, a brief? And where, for the matter
of that, is the layman who doesn’t think he gains
a point by employing a solicitor who is the judge’s
relative, or particular pal, to appear in the suit
over which his Honor presides? Yet, if you
asked us to name any judge now on the Aus-
tralian Bench who is notoriously influenced in his
judicial duties by his professional relatives we
couldn’t honestly do so.
* # #
One thing we should like to know : What
is the etiquette observed in the privacy of the
domestic circle between judicial father and barris-
terial son or son-in-law, or between judicial uncle
and barristerial nephew, concerning cases in
which the former has to preside and the latter to
appear as advocate? Do they never mention such
things, or do they, after the ordinary fashion of
human nature, give each other the “straight
griffin?” Whatever they do or do not do, it cer-
tainly is most uncomfortable for the litigant who
has not been so fortunate as to secure the Judge’s
relation to plead before the old man, to see his
enemies and the Court troop along to dinner as a
happy family party.
# # #
Apropos , we once saw a man who was a
fellow-traveller by coach with a Judge on circuit
carve the mutton at dinner, and, seeing that his
Honor liked his meat well done, gushingly volun-
teer to pass along to him “a little more of the
brown,” which the Judge gratefully accepted.
Next day, when Regina v. Brown, sheep-stealing,
was called on, Mr. Brown (the carver), who had
been on bail, stepped behind the spikes and
greeted his Honor with what was rather a nod
than a bow. He was acquitted, and the Judge,
with a twinkle in his eye, told him that he had
had a very narrow escape, and that it should be a
warning to him against placing himself in any
position in which he might fairly be suspected of
having carved another man’s mutton.
# # #
A haughty Victorian School-Inspector,
while inspecting a country-school kept by a lady,
was offered a cup of tea. He raised his eyebrows,
but, as the day was hot, he accepted the beverage
in dignified silence. Ten minutes after his
departure, a small package of “ post-and-rail ” tea
arrived from the nearest store —Jib. of “ ten-
penny,” value 2|d.—with this curt letter : “Memo
for Miss , I drank your tea because you are
a lady, but a man in my position could not
possibly accept so small a favour from one of my
subordinates. ”
# # *
A feature of the baccarat case was the
neglect of Lady Coleridge to stand up, like every-
body else, when her husband entered court. Her
disrespect was very womanly and natural, after
I all. She forgot that Coleridge was Lord Chief-
Justice, and couldn’t see any sense in rising from
her seat because the “ old man ” had arrived.
Which reminds us that it must be a severe trial
for certain vice-regal ladies to get upon their im-
perious feet when a henpecked Excellency comes
along to open Parliament, or perform any other
function at which his wife is an ordinary spectator.
But they have to do it. Mutual reverence amongst
royalties and vice-royalties is the secret of their

HE (under a glaring lamp in the Park) : “Here is a vacant seat, Miss Boodle-shall we
take it ?”
SHE (pctulantly) : “Well, since all the others seem to be occupied, I suppose there is no
alternative.”
London newspaper reports of the baccarat
scandal case, and their comments thereon, quite
bear out Bulletin theories. The young men who
swore they saw Gumming cheat were accused by
plaintiff’s counsel of having been mildly intoxi-
cated all through the Doncaster race-week, and
the influence of champagne upon the female
imagination was remotely hinted at. Also, it is
suggested in more than one journal (even the
Argus “social gossiper” goes thus far), that a
Tory Solicitor-General was not the man to cham-
pion Gumming against the Prince of Wales and
party. He merely put the Heir Apparent in the
witness-box for the purpose of whitewashing him
as far as was possible under (or over) such dirty
circumstances.

Colombo is fast becoming notorious for
suicides. “Dr.” Drummond, of Sydney, who
levanted with his wife’s trust-funds some time
ago, took poison there ; then Phil. Beck blew out
his brains on board a P. and O. boat as she was
entering Colombo harbour ; and now Davidson
and the erring Miss Ayliffe, of Adelaide, have
added their names to Colombo felo-de-ses. It was
at Colombo that sculler Searle caught the fever
which ultimately proved fatal.

Sara Bernhardt appears to have con-
ceived a great dislike to the Adelaide society
people. On the day of her departure all the smart
crowd hied to the local railway-station to grasp
the hand of the “ divine ” and bid her an affec-
tionate and sisterly good-bye. But Sara went
to the station about a quarter to three, and, enter-
ing her carriage, drew the blinds and resolutely
refused to see anybody. The crowd was disap-
pointed, and the train left the station amid a
deathly silence,

The Bulletin notices that a certain
Sydney building society, which is in difficulties
and cannot meet the demands of its depositors,
still brazenly advertises for deposits and offers
alluring rates of interest. Perhaps when the
directors of this institution find themselves on
the public roads, they will recognise the fact that
there is such a thing as a criminal law. There is in
N.S. Wales at present absolutely no law to pro-
tect the provident worker from the operations of
such sharks. The present audits are mostly
shams,

“When Greek meets Greek.” On 3rd
June, at the Leichhardt Hotel, Rockhampton,
Dr. Spiridion Candiottis went to his last rest. In
every part of Australia there will be Bulletin
readers to notice this with interest, for many were
the men in many paits who knew “ Old Candy.”
Practising in the fifties on the old Victorian gold-
fields, afterwards on the Lachlan, then residing
in Sydney, he eventually followed the Baroona
and Peak Downs rushes, and settled at the latter
place for the rest of his life. A Greek of the Her-
culean type with the constitution and strength of
an elephant, the companion of Sir Julius Vogel
on the Lachlan and afterwards the friend of gold-
warden Griffin, the tales that were told of him
would fill a book. One of the best known was
related in the Australasian a few years ago by
David Falk, who, doubtless, thinking the hero of
it long since defunct, headed it with the real
name : “ Candiottis, the Greek.” Kind friends did
not fail to supply him with copies of the paper,
but, although the eyes gleamed under the shaggy
eyebrows, the old man was wise in his generation
and said nothing. A fanatic over whist, ho was
such a terror to his partners that at one time
the whole district unanimously refused to play
except against him, and it is said that the only
time he fairly met his match was when he inad-
vertently sat down to play Sir Arthur Palmer.
He had other little weaknesses. He once tried to
sell a friend of the present writer a book of which
he had two copies. He said, “ That book is new,
it cost seventeen shillings, the postal order that
I sent was fourpenoe and the stamp twopence—
that will make seventeen and six.” Said the other,
“But aren’t you going to charge for the note-
paper and envelope ! ” But with all his little
failings he was emphatically a strong man, as
many have found to their cost.

Beaney’s will remembers the diamond-in-

Lachal, almost the only living reminder of the

Beaney would give reporters any amount
of gratuitous treatment, and we have heard an
impecunious journalist say, “Beaney is always
good for a £lO note, if a man has the cheek to go

the press, and hatred of another, dated from the
Lewis trial.

A fair creature in Queensland asks The
Bulletin to publish seven sheets_ of foolscap
written all over on both sides setting forth her
grievances against her husband. She says that
after their marriage the old man led a very giddy
and erratic life for years, but, falling seriously ill,
he suddenly manifested a most tender affection
for her. “He got very frightened,” she says,
“ and was never satisfied if I wasn’t at his bedside
holding his hand.” But all this suddenly changed
as soon as he was convalescent. Two days after
he arose from his bed of sickness he appears to
have taken a red-headed woman out for a drive.
“Not,” writes the injured wife, “that I would
have minded that so much, but the cat actually
came in a boastful way to me, and, bold as brass,
told me that she spent a very pleasant afternoon
with Teddy.” Our beauteous correspondent asks
us for advice. We will ponder over the matter
for six months.

The big Melbourne drapery business of
Buckley and Nunn has been sold to a syndicate
for £350,000.. stock,lockandbarrel. Whereby hangs
a tale. For more than thirty years Buckley managed
the show in Melbourne, whilst Nunn bought for
the firm in London. They never nut. Once
when Buckley had booked his passage home,
and was on the point of starting, he suddenly un-
packed his trunks and stopped' where he was, to
the great grief of his employes, who loved him
dearly and thought a nice sea-voyage would bo
good for everybody’s health. Finally, Nunn
astounded the rag trade by turning up in Mel-
bourne, a few months ago. Having wept on the
bosom of his long-lost partner and taken a look
around him, the mysterious Nunn returned home,
his death being announced by cable very shortly
afterwards. As a matter of fact Nunn drowned
himself in the river Avon, a stream .otherwise
famous for a certain immortal “Swan.” Then
there was no Nunn at ail, and the old business
passed into new hands last week. Sic transit
gloria nunndie—no, mundi.

A MELANCHOLY EVENT.
A ballad of an Emperor who travels from afar
Upon a “brilliant” visit to his good old grand-
mam ar ;
He lands in Merrie Hingland ’midst a burst of
“loyal ” whoops,
All his uncles being present with a quantity of
troops.
Before he lands, God bless him ! he is greeted on
the brine
With a naval demonstration by the vessels of the
“ line ” :
The bold marines are mustered in the bows and m
the poops— .
For there’s nothing pleases emperors like ironclads
and troops.
He compliments the country on the men he sees
arrayed
(Who, at twenty pounds per annum, are a trifle
over-paid) ; . ...
He slyly turns to Tummy, and a royal eyelid
droops
As he whispers, “ I say, nunky, do you often lead
the troops ?”
They take him off to Windsor to be welcomed by
the Queen
(There’s a dozen special artists making sketches of
the scene),
She wants to kiss his forehead, so he dutifully
stoops,
And opens up the subject of those everlasting
troops.
Dear Granny, who’s domestic like, as “ loyal ”
papers tell,
Delights to ask her William if his little ones are
well,
She talks of royal infants, and their measles, and
their croups,
“A babe in arms,” says William, “ sets me think-
ing of the troops,”
They form a grand procession, and they march
away to dine,
The uniforms and ladies make a spectacle divine 5
They discuss a gross of courses after starting on
the soups,
Yet the flow of conversation never gets oeyond
the troops.
And when the feed is finished this remarkable
young man
Suggests he’d like to see as many soldiers as he
can ; , , , .
So all the Royal Family they stand around in
groups
Whilst Vicky shows her relative the body-guard
of troops. * *

He swaggers round the barracks where the warriors

Anon he swaps his tunic for the one with bigger

Then clanks away with Tummy to inspect a lot of

He keeps on seeing soldiers till he can’t see any

And then, the visit over, back to Yarmany he

To pass his days, God help him ! in congratu-

A petition for a reduction of the mon-
strous sentence of eight years’ penal servitude
passed on Haynes, defaulting land-agent at Hay
(N.S.W), for a small embezzlement (his first
offence), has been largely signed in that district.
The public have failed to comprehend either the
justice or the necessity of this crushing penalty,
especially so since Dulhunty, the defaulting
Corowa land-agent, the other day got only one
year for much more serious deficiencies. It is an
ugly coincidence that Dulhunty, who is “well-
connected,” was a “ society” man who gave cosy
dinners at the public expense, and had many
friends and much back-stairs influence. Such
things would, of course, not weigh with 1 the Judge,
who, it must be confessed, gave defendant what
was, under all the circumstances, a sufficientlv-
severe sentence ; but why so savage a penalty in
the case of Haynes ?•. ~ “■> ■

In March it was urged that two members
of the N.S.W. Rifle Association should be com-
pelled to retire at the end of one instead of two
years. Lieut. Hammond, says a contem-
porary, suggested that the matter should
remain in abeyance till the end of the
year, as some one might drop out. He, unfor-
tunately, was the first, being blown up at Middle
Head. Then Commander Lewington was asked
to name the other, and he put it off from week to
week until he, himself, made the second one, he
having been cut to pieces on the railway near
Arncliffe a week or two ago.

A laudable practical joke was recently
played upon a N.S.W. official who has a large num-
ber of minor appointments in his gift, and who has
the credit of giving billets to men—not too inquisi-
tive-possessed of attractive wives. A smart young
man wanted a billet, and hearing of the official’s
“peculiarity,” engaged a very pretty member of
the demi-monde to personate his wife. She waited
upon the official, succeeded in getting the appoint-
ment for her temporary hubby, and ingratiated
herself with the big man in a way that he will
never forget.

Pathetic chunk sawn oft’ an address on
the “Side Lights of City Life,” delivered before
the A.N.A. (Melbourne): “My friends, a sobbing
barmaid in one of the principal hotels in this city
told me, while tears choked her utterance, that
unless she drew more trade her services would not
be required.” He didn’t say what became of the
girl after that, but we presume he led her gently
away by the hand, and she became a reformed
character, and taught in the Sunday-school, and
after a while she eloped with the parson, when he
skipped with the trust-money belonging to sundry
orphans. When a man goes round sympathising
with weeping barmaids it always ends in some-
thing like that.

On a rough estimate, about 75 per cent,
of unmarried male hospital patients finish up by
proposing to the nurse, provided the nurse is a
female and reasonably good-looking. Conse-
quently, it is a nicer job than it looks to be a good
Samaritan in an hospital. When a fellow has
nothing to do but lie in his bunk, and groan, and
take medicine, it generally happens that he must
fall in love with somebody, if it is only to kill
time, and when he is visited at intervals by a
slender female in a graceful costume he naturally
begins to feel a poetic yearning underneath his
mustard-plaster. Being in a weakened and dis-
organised state, he is capable of yearning over any
maiden under sixty, and the average nurse is a
good deal under it. And, moreover, her hair is
nicely arranged, as a rule, and she mostly has a
wistful, sympathetic expression in her eyes, which
makes her look as if she was thinking about
poetry, when she is only smothering her feelings
about the troublesome patient who is sure to
holler for her under the impression that he is
dying just when she wants to sit down and have a
rest.

According to Sydney Presbyterian, five
available Church of England parsons, including a
Bishop, refused to officiate at a recent Moree
N.S.W. funeral when asked to do so in the
absence of a “dissenting ” clergyman. The excuse
given was that the ground was not consecrated.
An orthodox parson can only pray on holy ground
and according to routine rules. Some parsons
never pray outside of their surplices.

Sydney Evening News advertising baby-
market is just now in an active condition. The
Inspector-General of Police might do worse than
tell off one of his smartest detectives for a year to
watch the operations of that interesting institu-
tion. Also, the Evening News is just now very
full indeed of the “young lady” who wants to
borrow £5 from “a kind gentleman.” The other
evening, by the case was reversed,
thus :
WANTED, kind young Lady to LEND young man
' ' Few Pounds ; repaid quarterly instalments.
Quarterly, E. News Office.
You see the lady must be young ; an old woman’s
money won’t be accepted. Bet you men of this
kidney will do better at the game than even the
distressed “young ladies” have done. We pre-
sume that the detectives keep their eye on this
class of appeal. Inspector Camphin, it will be
remembered, arrested those cruel murderers,
Nicholls and Lester, purely through an idea which
occured to him on reading an innocent-looking
advertisement, inserted in all good-faith by the
S.M. Herald.

The alleged fact that a pious “ smarty ”
solicitor, in the employ of a Sydney legal firm,
whose piety has brought it, well, quite as much
of its business as its legal acumen, has just
victimised several wealthy Wesleyan clients of
his employers, for some thousands of pounds, and
then levanted, reminds one of the malicious story,
well-known to the members of the Articled Clerks
Association, about the man who once sued for
slander the other who had called him a Wesleyan
—“meaning thereby,” &o. The continuation
may be fitted in according to taste and experience,
but, in this instance now under notice, the
ordinarily-inserted innuendo fits like a glove.

The well-managed and prosperous Com-

Robert Charles Cole —a youth, now committed for
trial, who joined its service in 1884, at £5O a year,
and who, when he retired recently, enjoyed an
annual salary of £l9l ss.—of forging warrants for
£8857, which amount he appears to have duly got
in cash from time to time. The detectives are
just now busy in trying to find out where the
money has been planted. It is alleged that the
bank’s total loss through the recently-discovered
system of warrant-forging amounts to, at least,
£lB,OOO.

Not Charles Strong, but his lieutenant
(Alexander Marshall) is the best-advertised Mel-
bourne parson now-a-days. The eloquent plati-
tudes of this “ advanced ” apostle, honest and
practical enough as sermons §o, are published by
Melbourne Heeald as quite the newest thing in
revelations. Monday’s Heeald, glittering with
gems of thought like “Rev. Marshall says that
every man can do something towards making
society better,” or “In the opinion of Rev. Alex.
Marshal], the world requires more brotherly love
than he sees displayed ” is uncommonly suggestive
of a penny tract. There are extenuating circum-
stances to be found in the evenin’ horgan, how-
ever. Side by side with exhortations to search for
the “ higher life,’’one gets full details of a criminal
assault in lower life, so the whole may be likened
to a ham sandwich, or rum and milk.

The alleged fact that all the German,

impenetrable cuirasses, reminds one of the Life

how he would like to fight the battle o’er again
replied, ‘ ‘ In my shirt-sleeves, sir. ”
The full report of the late naval battles on
the Chilian coast is interesting reading for those
Australians who are very much inflated about the
new and glorious ironclad navy which has just
been laid on. The scrimmage began by the insur-
gent warships O’Higgins and Blanco Encalada
blockading Valparaiso and Balmaceda’s squadron,
consisting of one little gunboat, the Mary Florence,
and a torpedo-boat. These two tiny vessels
rushed out on a forlorn hope one dark night, and
in about two seconds the gunboat was a mass of
undistinguishablo hash, and everybody on board
was knocked into pie; while as for the torpedo
craft there wasn’t enough of it left to scratch a cat
with. These two boats probably cost about as
much as the N.S.W. Freetrade surplus amounts
to in twelve months, and they only gave some-
thing like half a minute’s fun altogether. Next
minute a shell from one of the forts struck the
O’Higgins somewhere about the stomach, and
it looked as if the Last Hay had broken
out on board. It probably took two years
to build that ironclad, and it cost about as
much as the price of 50 miles of railway, and
three-fourths of it went into the air in fireworks
with a single shot. Two or three days later the
Blanco Encalada was lying off Caldera, when
something else happened. She was the pride of
the whole navy—about £500,000 worth of pompous
ironclad in one heap—and two little torpedo-
boats came along and sunk all that money right
off. There was just one ghastly roar, as if a fire
had broken out in Tophet and all the devils were
rushing for the door, a great mass of shattered
iron, a big feed for the sharks, and then the
captain swam ashore with half his clothes blown
off him, and howled with rage on the beach, and
all was finished. This ironclad business doesn’t
promise to pay.

RHEUMATISM versus MICROBE
KILLER.
294 Castleresgh-street, June 25, 1891.
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co., Gentlemen, —For
forty years I have been a sufferer from rheu-
matism, and latterly in the most aggravated form,
often having acute attacks which made me almost
helpless for days, insomuch that it was with the
greatest pain and difficulty that I could move
about at all, and only able to get up stairs on my
hands and knees. A friend who had tried the
“Microbe Killer” with beneficial results sent me
a jar of the medicine, which I took, and I have
now taken three jars of “Microbe Killer” and
the result has been a great wonder to myself and
my friends, for now I can get about freely, with-
out pain. I go up and down stairs without any
trouble, and I am greatly improved in health
every way. In fact my suffering from rheumatism
seems a thing of the past, and I can recommend
the “ Microbe Killer ” to anyone with confidence,
knowing what it has done for me. Several have
tried your medicine on my recommendation for
other diseases—and one a cancer patient—with
the same beneficial results.—Yours respectfully,
MRS. WHITAKER.

feebled and less capable of resisting prevailing
diseases. Among the indications of depraved
blood are boils, carbuncles, pimples, eruptions,
sore eyes, ulcers, tumors, and glandular swell-
ings. To strike at the root of these evils,
cleanse the blood with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
This medicine has maintained its world-wide
reputation, for nearly half a century, as the
Standard Blood-Purifier.
It is a highly-concentrated extract of the most
powerful vegetable alteratives and tonics. The!
most effective remedy for scrofula, it is equally
beneficial in gout, rheumatism, catarrh, and
dyspepsia, also in liver and kidney com-
plaints. A medicine for men, women,
and children. Be sure and ask for

THIS IS MARKHAM’S SHADOW.
WHO IS MARKHAM?
If one-half of what is prophesied concerning
\ Markham (Merchant Draper,; of WaUsend)
comes true, it would not be surprising if his name
gffto the forefront at a bound. The following
results are gi ven for what they are.worth. Whoso
has eyes.and ears let him see and hear.
Th'e air is full of sensational reports, and as you
ask the fallowing are thrown at you on all sides ;
‘•Markham is a madman,’ Markham is a
Monte Christo, ’’ “ Markham is a coming mil-
lionaire,” “Markham is a coining member of
Parliament, who will ’‘ come ’ in politics and be a
nbwer for tho people* . , . ,
Now when such things are said about a man
not yet three years before the public there must
he something in it. He, is commonly spoken of as
a marvel and mystery. Let linn speak for hi m-
S * "Markham, they say you are mad?” “Yes,
mad as a March hare. You heard that from my
, iip tftors They sav publicly that T sell-at less
SStgS for things. ‘ Tho foot i«, I .hoot to
, ,Uwil« bargain ill Melbourne or Sydney
buy at the lowest, sell on the smallest, and if it
turns out that my selling price is less than their
buying one, I can’t help it. Yes, I’m mad; if
that’s madness, I’m getting mad dailj .
“THEY CALL YOU A ‘MONTE CHRISTO.’
I suppose that’s because I have made my money
rauidlv Monte Christo had his Abbe, whoqmt
him on the track of his cjolden cave I too have
my Abbe. You will find her in the person of
Mrs. Harle, the lady-clairvoyant of Newcastle.
It is public property that her ‘tips and my brains
Oombme thknake ‘ Empire Hou.e' .« pre.ent
phenomenal success. I refer you to her. All I
eau say is I’m in the cave, and the dust and
diamonds are being handled. „
‘‘they say you’re a coming millionaire!
“ I should be sorry if it were not so. I value
mv real and personal now at £30,000, and if that s
in less than three years, and I am only twenty-
eight, why should I not see several millions yet?
I’ll tell you how I reckon my future. I ni on the
third step of a ladder of seventy rungs-each rung
is computed on the compound interest principle.
Figure out that if you can.
“ YOU AHE MENTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH
POLITICS.”
“ Not hist yet awhile. Wait till I’m indepen-
dent, which won’t be long, and if I do not plump
for the people’s rights—division of profits, one
vote, (fee., my name isn’t Markham. Yes, I hope
to do more for the people than_ I have yet done,
though I reckon my price during the late strike
was more help to the men of this part than all
the gas and brag about the strike from senti-
mental supporters. Yes, I hope to be in Parlia-
to some purpose some day.”
, “ what’s YOUR HISTORY, BRIEFLY ? ”
“ I was born on the Clarence, in 1863. The
world heard of the Clarence in aquatics. 1 cherish
the hope it will hear of the Clarence in finance
yet, and legislation. I started drapery with J J.
Kitson, of Newcastle, graduated in screw into
Gabon’s, and just about this time ‘ Empire House
was opened by Mr. Galton, The management was
twice changed in as many years, I saw the
chance, and set to work to make myself worthy of
the position. I evidently succeeded, for the
management fell to me, my employer apparently
thinking I could fill the post with credit to us
both. I did my best, the house became popular,
all was going splendidly, when Mr. G. contem-
plated going home, and I had to come to head-
quarters in Newcastle. My successor was not a
success, and the man who followed him ditto. I he
takings receded to under £2o0 per month (why,
bless you, I’ve done over that in a day lately.) i
was reinstated to work the concern to selling price.
It was hinted that I might take it myself, and a
copy of conditions forwarded to me. I took it
over amidst congratulations such as Fool.
‘Upstart!’ ‘ Out of his depth !’ &c. A_stnko
was on at the time to boot. Here I am to-day, as
you see.” i
“ what do you take now ?”
“Over £2000 per month. Only for a bit of
double shuffle during the salvage sale at the big
tire in Sydney, I’d have cleared £15,000 in one
bop.”
“but you have made money in other ways.'
“Oh, yes; I have mining and other company
and property interests all over the colony-—Bin-
gera, Bungendore, Gulgong, Hill End, up
Stewart’s Brook way, Melbourne, and other
places all owe me assets. There's a telegram
(producing it) offering me £10,000 for an interest
in a pavement. I have taken as much as
£100,000 worth of property to Melbourne with me
under offer to syndicates. I in prepared to place
£200,000 now. My figure to shift out of my busi-
ness alone is £20,000."
It all goes to prove that “Australia for the Aus-
tralians ” is a workable thesis, and there are
brains and ambition enough in our young men of
to-day for anything. Thousands of young men
to-day would chance a squeeze through with the
“camels” in the next world to stand in his
shoes. He has had a terrific battle to fight, up
are told, and many unutterable meannesses have
been perpetrated on him as is always the case
with rising men. •
MRS. HARLE INTERVIEWED.
In answer to inquiry Mrs. Harle says: —
“ Markham has brains. I found that out long
ago; now the world is seeing it. I am not
ashamed of my pupil, and I point to him with
pride as an example to young men. I hype to see
him do all he is aiming at.’
CORRESPONDENCE
“ The Iliad : It is not a fact. There may be a
prejudice against the election of a If.(J. Prime Minister,
hut there is no disqualification for the ollice in Catholicism.
“Herbert West”; For information see “Poverty
Point ”of July 4 “ Isaac Smith ”: In British counties,
freeholders, copyholders, and tenants with a CO years’
lease of an annual, value of £0 are entitled to vote.
Holders of shorter leases must pay a rateable value of’£l2
to be qualified. In British boroughs the same qualifica-
tions apply to all owners or occupiers holding leases of
houses, provided that the house is assessed to the poor-
rate, also to every tenant, without lease, of a ten-pound
lodging, if he proves a year's occupation in the elector-
ate “A.M.0.”: The Bulletin sincerely hopes that
“ Droughty ” Egeson has got the most severe attack of
influenza of the season...." A. J. M‘Kenzie ” : The N.S.W.
iron-deposits cannot be profitably exploited without either
Protection or a huge Government guarantee—which is
the same thing. Anyone who started to manufacture
iron in N.S.W' under present conditions with a view to
profit could only be a congenital idiot. .. “W. Jeffery ” :
What we said was that as a public tribute of a man’s
merit a statue was worthless, unless it was erected by the
general public, and not by some faddist or clique....
“ A Secularist”: There are a dozen such chapters which
you should be able to find for yourself... “ Womerah ”:

name the date “ G.H.M.” (London); Thanks for

gets £1044 annually ; the Chief Justice a similar amount
and the Puisne Judges, £1440 each “E.J.H.” (Bed-
fern): Think the Blaine-Gladstone controversy was
carried on in the pages of North American Review.
May have been published as a pamphlet. Write Turner
and Henderson, Hunter-street, Sydney... “Constant

agent on his own account. Grey’s religion—One-man-one-

letter which is inconsistent with our position. Why not
lie specific?...." A. Macansh” :We don’t know why the
British naval authorities “favour a sectarian institution
like St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.” Probably it is
because the naval medical staff find that there are no
surgical nurses equal to the Sisters of Mercy who, as
their aim in life is not to get married, are enabled to
strictlv concentrate their attention and sympathies on
their patients. Anyhow, we have heard at least one fleet
surgeon, who, like most doctors, believe in no degma, say
this “A J.M.”: On the case as stated, we advise you
not to go to law. If you appear before a sane Judge he
will commit you to gaol for perjury and you will get three
years, which you will deserve, on your own showing....
“W.B”: If it were once clearly shown that, as alleged,
Parkes “ advisedly ” took steps to prevent the operation
of the N.S.W. Payment of Members Act from extending
beyond the members of the last Parliament, by obtaining
the passage of a subtle amendment whose deadly effect
was not visible to the naked eye, the Labour-party
would throw him out of office neck and crop,. . .

A.M.P. Society thinks about the Single-tax, and its direct
effect upon provident institutions ..“ G.R.”: Have handed
it to reliable lawyer, who will write you.. A.M. : The
N.S.W. Bankruptcy Act allows the insolvent to retain
sustenance-money, pending issue of his certificate, instead
of handing all over to the official-assignee. Mr. Neild put
up £4O, admittedly earned by himself after insolvency
and obviously not spent in sustenance, as an election-
deposit, and the assignee seized it. Mr. Neild, instead of
the money for sustenance purposes, practically
gambled with it, by, so to speak, wagering it on a con-
tingency—the result of a parliamentary election—and the
assignee holds that the money, having been diverted from
its proper purpose, is seizable on behalf
creditors : Neild, on the other hand, urges that the £4O
had already been .allowed him by the Court. And there
the matter stands “ J.8.D.” (Townsville): Thanks

Whatever else it may have done, the flood
in Melbourne has shown people the value of learn-
to swim. The following letter, which has been
received from a Sydney native, who has been rus-
ticating in the toney suburb of Toorak, shows on
experience out of many: Dear , 7 ’
mebhoy. I’m still alive, but, as you may have
heard, 1 had a bit of a squeak for it. I have
staying with our mutual friends, the — s, an( ? ‘
real good time I’ve had, as you may imagine,
on Sunday it nearly came to a sudden end. , -
old gentleman and I went to have a look at the
floods, which have been pretty, bad about a quarter
of a mile from here. We were down in a low-lying
place below the level of the river, when a wall which
had kept the water back suddenly gave way all ot
a heap, and before you could wink it was on us.
Don’t ask me about it. The old gentleman, as
luck would have it, was just out of reach, but it
caught me fair, and before I could get out of it, .1
was being carried off just like a doll by a young
retriever. I really saw all my past misdeeds m
one act, and there were a good crowd of them, i
can tell you, and I thought it was all up wi i
yours truly. But, the old instinct seized me and
almost without knowing what I was doing i struck
out and tried to get to high land. How I should
have managed 12 months ago I can t say, but.
thanks to you, old boy, I attended the Natatonum
in Pitt-street, in spite of my own inclination, ana
I shall always regard you as my preserver, as it
was only through you I learned to swim. At any
rate, 1 was able to struggle out of it just alive and
no more. I shall always attribute my safety o
the fact that you induced me to attend the
Natatorium, where I improved my swimming, but
for which I should now probably be a fit subject
for an inquest. I shall, on my return, try and get
all my friends to attend there regularly. Please
tell Jennie that the rumour that I was drowned is
not true, and that I '■hall see you all again next
week, none the worse for wear.”*

“LUXENE,'
THE NEW ILLUMINANT,
THE MOST POWERFUL, ECONOMICAL
AND SAFEST LIGHT KNOWN.
The dawn of creation vvaa signified by the tub
filment of the Divine command, “Let there be
light,” and the division of the light from the dark-
ness was coincident with the germ of a provision
of those inexhaustible stores of Nature from "’lnch
man in the ages to follow was to extract, after one
fashion or another, the varied artificial lights
which would naturally be required to enable him
to fulfil his mission on earth. And as soon as the
light made the darkness visible, the iace ot
Nature, as it then was, brightened exceedingly
and became gladsome and joyous, and
the CHEAT ORNITHORHYNCHUB
commenced his gambols with the lively and intelli-
gent bacilli, and the entozoas, and the proas, and
plasms of the unformed animal world set out in
pursuit of prey and gave chase to the buffalo, the
octohedron, the moa, the phalangers, and other
duodecimals of irregular habits, and “played up
Old Harry ” generally, until pre-Adamite man
appeared upon the scene and reduced absolute
chaos to comparative disorder under the influence
of his magnetic eye and the cunning of ms right
hand. But even he was powerless-at night when
clouds obscured the face of the moon and the
twinkle of the stars, and all the
WILD BEASTS AND INSECTS
roared their defiance of him from the rocks and
fissures, and poked fun at him from the tree-tops,
and chased him about in his pyjamas and bitj and
stung him simply because he had no light by
which ho could see to fire bricks at them with any
degree of accuracy, and he had to keep awake all
night and dodge them from shelter to shelter until
his life became a wearisome misery to him for the
want of knowing how to turn night into day ; an
art which his 19th century descendants have
worked out to their entire satisfaction.
Therefore he devoted all his energies to the dis-
covery of an artificial light which would enable
him to combat with his nocturnal enemies, and to
keep them at bay while he walked up and down
in the wilderness with his teething infant, and
administered the paregoric and the pepperment or
THE CLINGING SLIPPER,
as the case might be, according to the necessities
of the moment. ■ . .
And first of all he hit on a plan of obtaining it
by the friction of two sticks, but it was a long
and tedious process during winch the mosquitoes
bit him and the native dog howled at him from
the distance, and the scorpion prospected his feet,
while the light-hearted centipede dropped from a
branch overhead down the back of his neck. And
generation succeeded generation until presently
he discovered the use of Hint and steel, and the
pitchpine and other resinous torches, and then the
fat of his numerous victims attracted his attention
and led up to the invention of the useful but
EVIL-SMELLING FAT-LAMP,
from which to mutton-fat candles was but a short
jump, and their use suggested to him the expres-
sion of liquid fats or oils from both animals and
vegetables, and the fabrication of lamps in which
to burn them, and distribute the powerful aroma
over larger areas of country. And when .other
and more ingenious men smelt this burnt incense
they set themselves to go one better, and they
found coal and made gas therefrom, and estab-
lished monopolies which have ground the faces
of the poor and eaten out the hearts of countless
thousands, who have, gone to their graves with
broken hearts and shattered frames in consequence.
Others again dug and found ready-made oil stored
away in natural cisterns, into which they inserted
pumps and formed “ trusts, ’ and built up syndi-
cates, and companies, and
MONOPOLIES OF ANOTHER SORT,
but none the less venomous, and they advertised
various fictitious legends with regard to these oils,
which they divided into “ grades,” as they called
them, the only difference between which was that
one “grade” would blow a whole family with
their house and a quarter-acre allotment higher
and into smaller pieces and nearer to the confines
of perdition in less time than another grade,
which happened to belong to a rival syndicate.
And these combustibles were called by a variety
of names, such as petroleum, and petroline, and
kerosene, and numerous other “urns ” and “ines,
and “isms,” but all more or less possessed of the
familiar suddenness of forked lightning, and the
EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF DYNAMITE,
and worse of all at the very time when they were
supposed to be perfectly reliable on account of a
guarantee that they had been tested, and in-
spected, and set fire to, and put out again, and
thoroughly overhauled by presidents and com-
mittees and experts of great judgment. But in
spite of all these precautions they still continue to
go off at frequent intervals and wreck properties,
and break up happy little family circles, until
human nature rebelled against imposition, and
then the electric-light was introduced. But it was
altogether too frisky and uncertain and sen-
sational an illuminant to suit all classes, and at
last it has been rewarded with a success which
may be justly claimed as the
SUCCESS OF THE CENTURY.
At last there is light; light that is pure and
beautiful, maintained from a source that js-con-
stant, economical, and absolutely devoid of all risk,
danger, and unpleasantness. Luxene is the dis-
covery of the age. It is a powerful illuminant
with an indisputable title to the before mentioned
characteristics, and some others which will even-
tually be emphasised in the works of the Govern-
ment statistician, and will be at once recognised
in the enormous reduction of the number of deaths
registered in the column which refers to lamp
explosions. , ',. ,
Luxene is a genuine discovery of an entirely
new application of one of the sources of artificial
light; it is devoid of smell when burning, and
cannot be purposely fired under any conditions
except such as may be resorted to by
A LUNATIC OR AN IDIOT.
11 is prepared for market by an entirely new
process, and can be strongly recommended for
domestic use both in town and country ; and under
all conditions in which oil is used for illuminating
purposes, and where freedom from smell, brilliancy
of light at a low cost, and absolute safety, and con-
sidered as factors of general importance among
the details of human life and progress.
Luxene can be obtained from Messrs. John
Barlow and Co., T. W. Eady and Son, and
Mason Bros., Sydney, and from Jesse Ireland,
and R. Hall and Sons, Newcastle, and consumers
will soon learn to understand the truth of the
assertion that its use will go far towards minim-
ising the necessity for heavy fire insurance besides
imparting an additional security to the \alueof
life, and adding largely to its .pleasure-. ..

MEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost

adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS. .
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-

Little boys should always be good and
never object to being put into the bath. There
was not long ago a little but good old dog, which,
instead of running away when it saw the tub,
always jumped into the water on its own account.
One day lately, the good dog, seeing the groom
bring the tub, almost at once hopped over the
side. And as the groom had previously started
with two pailfuls of boiling water, the good little
dog died in one act.
Dear Bulletin, —I have read your article,An
Australian Paper Currency,” and while generally admit-
ting the soundness of the arguments used, beg to contra-
dict (at least as far as one bank is concerned) your asser-
tion that the Australian banks would be obliged to close
their doors if they were suddenly compelled to redeem
their notes with gold. At the last half-yearly balance of
the Bank of N.S.W. on the 31st March, 1891, the balances
of coin and bullion were £3,186,312 11s. lid., and the
notes in circulation only amounted to £714,508, which
proves that the note issue is of far greater convenience to
the public generally than advantageous to the bank itself.
Another point you do not seem to have considered is that
the N.S.W. banks pay a tax of 2 per cent, on all notes
issued for circulation, although in reality the greater part
of the notes so taxed are kept in the safes of the country
branches, and are virtually not in use.—Yours truly,
Banker. Taree (N.S.W.), 22ud June, 1891.'
The Bulletin has always flattered itself
that it enjoyed a big circulation amongst the
goody-goodies who, according to their own
account, never read it at all, and occasionally
we smile at striking instances of the power of the
Archimedean lever as exercised from this office.
Readers will remember that a recent Bulletin
allusion to a medallion of the disgraced Mirams
remaining over the. main entrance to Melbourne
Federal Coffee Palace, was almost immediately
followed by the demolition of the said memento.
Remarking on this, shortly afterwards, a para-
graphist hinted herein that a number of other
names—most of them prominent of old-time in
Premier Permanent matters—still remained em-
blazoned on a memorial-stone of the palace afore-
said. Attention being again “directed” to this
anomalous circumstance, a few days ago the spot
which used to be covered by a marble tablet,
bearing- the more or less besmirched names of
Mirams’ confreres, also became a blank.
Captain Yerney, “ the maiden tribute
gentleman now languishing in gaol, was the

A correspondent on the Paroo writes us as
follows: —
Dear Bulletin, —I want to tell you something about
the unnatural history of camels. There are any number
of camels come out here now from Bourke with supplies.
You know what a camel is like—a great, dismal, bumble-
legged, devil-faced abomination; bites like an alligator,
and smells like a badger. You’ll see a whole string ot
these things coming across the plains, swaying from siae
to side, with their nasty vicious heads stuck out in front
of them, looking for all the world as if the devil had built
a big wooden framework, covered it with scraggy hair,
stuck a hump on its back and a tail on its stern, and then
turned it loose on the great Australian desert to frighten
horses. And how they do frighten horses ! Great Deter .
The first time a camel-train comes to a station, all trie
horses about the place run for their lives. They get so
frightened that they will gallop right through a fence ana
never notice it. If a horse has a man on his back, ne
throws the man so as to travel faster, and if he is mtohea
to a buggy he takes the buggy and occupants with him
full gallop till he can smash something and get loose; u a
horse gets even a sniff of them, he goes right out ot
his mind. They carry about six hundredweight at a
load, and as often as not the loading is put into
red four-hundred-gallon tanks, and two tanks are slung
on each camel; that is the time they look well,
with a big red tank each side as a setting for their super-
natural ugliness. They wobble along about four miles an
hour, but if they are hurried they change to a kind of
shuffle, and although this looks no faster than the other
pace, yet it would keep a horse at a fair canter to travel
alongside—if you could get him to travel alongside, which
you couldn’t under any circumstances. They are in
charge of Afghans—slight, wiry, black parties. Bach
Afghan leads about six camels, he himself trudging along
in front with the first one’s rope over his shoulder, and
the rest are hitched one after another in single file. The
boss Afghan is a dandy—wears boots and breeches, no
less, and rides in front of the procession on some sort of a
thoroughbred dromedary, and has a gorgeous turban
round his head. The shearers and carriers hate the sight
of them ; they are non-union, scab, blackleg, niffger—
won’t join the Carriers’ Union. They can travel in the
droughts when there’s no water, and in the floods, when
all the ground is soft enough to bog a duck with a shingle
on his foot, they get so much mud on their great mis-
shapen feet that it seems as much as they can do to lift
them off the ground, but they get along somehow.
They have about fifty or sixty stomachs, so Ive
been told; anyhow, when they are tramping along
with nothing to think about they sometimes ‘ bring
up ” the lining of one of their numerous stomachs into
their mouths, and let it hang out until it is aired
sufficiently, and then they swallow it again. How’s that
for high? They came several times to the station
where I am, and on one of the later visits the horses
pulled up to have a look at them after galloping a mile or
two out onto the plain. It so happened that just as the
horses turned round the camels knelt down, and that
upset whatever little confidence the horses were beginning
to feel, and they wheeled short round and made off for
the Great Australian Bight, and I believe they’re going
yet. When I want to be revenged on Society for the
numerous wrongs it has done me, I intend to hire a camel
and ride him down George-street, Sydney, and watch the
cab-horses climb the telegraph-poles. Hoping this finds
you well as it leaves me at present.—Yours truly, Never-
Never.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The morning after the liberation of the
first three of the gang working in “Murderers’”
Pit, Port Arthur coal-mines, was joyous above
ground. The atmosphere was tinted with a
vaporous blue through which gleamed and
shimmered splashes of orient gold. Page, over-
man, carolled in the lightness of his heart and in
the exhilaration of spirits which were born of the
splendour of the day, and as he weighed into the
baskets the rations for the Six below, he threw in
a benhon with them. “Poor devils! To think
of them being down there on a day like this ! God
help ’em !”
Yet, as the reply-signal came up the shaft,
“ Rashuns c’rect, sir !” there was nothing partiep-
larly distressing in the accents of the answering
vo i oe _there was, indeed, something of merriment
in the tones. And then Page recollected that, of
course, the gang of miners could not possibly
know Nature had opened that morning her
richest treasury of beauty, and had decked peaks
and ranges, arms of the sea, and clumps of forest,
with light that was glorious and shade that was
luminous. Sixty feet deep in the womb of the
earth, Nature’s soft moods and her harsh moods
were alike to the Six. The lowering of the
tempest did not increase the gloom which held
them, vyce-like; the radiance of a dawn which
had missed its way, and arrived on this nether
sphere instead of at Paradise, did not reduce its
intensity by the shade of a shadow. So, Page’s
second "thoughts shaped themselves something
like this, and he wasted no more sympathy on the
entombed workers. After, all, they were “below ”
because their crimes had sent them there.
To tell the exact truth, the men below in “ No.
3 ” were almost as joyous as freeman Page himself.
Page had never known what it was to have lost
freedom. Therefore, he could never know what
it was to be within measurable distance of acquir-
ing it, though withheld by the authorities. And
that higher pleasure was now being enjoyed by
the men below. That was the reason why the
voice owned by Mr. Jones, principal felon of
“Murderers',’’was slightly unsteady with laughter.
They had been presented, had the men below,
with a superfluity of rations that morning,
and every extra ration meant another tool with
which to plot their path to liberty. That was why
Jones, and his co-villains, Hardy and Tooth, in-
dulged in vibrant chuckles. Laugh ! Who wpuld
not have laughed at the notion of making the
System contribute to its own defeat ? They had a
right to laugh.
“Sixteen ounces meat, an’ three of us don’t
want none! Three poun’s ! Two whole days’
tucker a-piece if we like to put ourselves on short
commons w’en we’ve given ’em leg-bail. An’
that’s not countin’ the meat!”
“Right, Jones ! Without the meat. And it’s
not a bad lump. See !” Hardy held up the day’s
rations of meat —a shapeless chunk of half-raw
beef. “There’s an ounce or two over, I’ll swear !”
“Let’s weigli it, an’ see!” The Other Three drew
together beneath the tallow-dip which was all
they chose to illuminate the gallery with. Jones
put his hand into a cup-like recess in a bank of
clay and drew out their “weights.” The neces-
sity of checking their rations and of making a fair
distribution among themselves had compelled them
to shape from lumps of coal “ weights” of varying
denominations, from an ounce to a pound. They
had brought the lumps to appoint nearly accurate
by using a meal-ration as a standard —the meal-
rations were seldom wrong, it was the.meat which
was frequently deficient —and the lumps could be
depended upon to half-an-ounce. The balance-
scales were supplied by the convicts’ own hands.
The coal-weights in one hand, and the rations in
the other—that was the way of it; and being
among the elder Children of the System, they had
had so much experience in checking food that they
could tell at once when the ration was lighter or
heavier than the symbol of weight.
“Six times twelve ounces is seventy-two ounces
that is wot, Hardy ?”
“ Four pounds an’ a-half.”
Jones placed a pound “ weight,” and a half-
pbund “weight” within the canvas bag which
contained their meal-ration, and taking it in his
left hand balanced, in his right the beef.
“Seems right! But you try, Toothy. We’ll all
try ! ”
“Go on ! Ain’t we all on the square, now that
we’ve done for—” the speaker stopped to jerk his
thumb in the direction of gallery No, 2
“them! We’re goin’ to trust you, Jones —ain't
you willin’, Hardy?”
“O’ course lam ! Jones is goin’ to play fair—
we’re all agoin’ to play fair—we’ve taken the Oath
—an’ one can’t get away without the others.”
“Right yer are, boys, then! We’ll jest be
loyal brothers o’ the Oath —same as we wor at th’
’Arbour. An’, o’ cos, we’re agoin’ to bolt to-
gether. One can’t go ’lone—we’ve all to go, or
none. Then we won’t bother ’bout weighin’ the
rations no more, shall we ?”
“No, o’ course not!” repeated Hardy, Tooth
echoed the assent.
And Jones’ lips, which had grown dry in the
fever of his anxiety, grew moist again.
This prince of scoundrels had determined if the
others would consent to let the rations go un-
weighed, that he, at least, would maintain his
strength unimpaired. Plausibility, when backed by
resource and ability to execute, came to the front
as readily in the circle of convictdom as it does in
the financial and political world of to-day. Jones
leader of his gang by virtue of his eminent
unscrupulousness. In a different sphere he would
have amassed a fortune by speculating with other
people’s money. Now he proposed to wrest
freedom for himself from the grasp of the Regime
by using the trustfulness of his brother-rogues and
their rations.
That was their one merit. Their infamy -was
not so stupendous as his. They really meant to
obey the Oath each had taken to be faithful to his
follows. He didn’t.
# # *
“Now, boys, to work!” When Jones
had issued the half-ration which was to be eaten
by each that day, he reminded them of their duty.
“We’ve to do double tides, boys. On ’arf
rashuns. But it’s on’y for a week, boys —an’
then, my word ! —won’t we bite into our first free
grub !” So, with example and voice he gave them
the enooui’agement a general should always ex-
tend to his followers. And though they were
hungry they took up picks and maul and began to
hew bravely at their double task.
Each had fifteen hundredweight to hew for
himself.
And each had fifteen hundredweight to hew for
a man in No, 2 gallery yonder.
Thirty hundredweight, each single hundred-
weight of one hundred and twenty pounds
avoirdupois, in all, was to be the day’s portion
for eight consecutive days. A double portion—
and only half-rations whereon to perform it. For
the men in No. 2 gallery would not help.
* * #
Three workers only—and six mustered
nightly—and rations for six drawn matutinally !
How was it done?
The Three in No. 2 gallery were the Three to
whom Death the Emancipator had come—Phillips,
Bunt, West. And the Three—Jones, Hardy,
Tooth—who worked, were the three who had been
the humble instruments by which the others had
been granted their freedom. Phillips had been
freed by Jones, Bunt by Tooth, West by Hardy—
and all because the three agents of the Emanci-
pator wanted the rations of the others to make
due provision for escape.
They could only obtain the rations by putting
forward the dead men at muster. If the dead
men were not mustered, Page, the overman, or
perhaps. Lieutenant Cooke himself, would be down
to investigate the cause, and a discovery would be
as fatal to Jones’, Tooth’s and Hardy’s chances of
escape and to their lives, as their own picks had
been to the existence of the dead Three. So the
nightly muster was essential, and because the
dead men were mustered, it was also necessary
that their tally of coal should be made up by their
murderers. If the baskets went up empty for one
night, that might be allowed to pass, save for the in-
timation next morning that the workers “had
better brighten up or stand the brunt; ” but a
second occurrence of “empties,” would almost
certainly be followed by a visit from up above.
On toil as they, would, it was im-
possible to furnish the full quota, and it was a
work which bore them down with a horribly
exacting strain to hew a quantity sufficient to
allot to each of the two baskets, now to be filled
by every man two-thirds of the appointed portion.
# '# *
It was on the seventh day after Inspection -
Sunday, that the Three had been ■ liberated; and
the night of the escape was fixed for the Saturday
night midway between that Inspection Sunday
and the next.
The •Three were liberated, we say, on a Saturday
night. The following morning the conversation as
to the rations took place. That Sunday night the
first muster happened. -
“ One —Two—Three Four —Five—Six. All
right ! Arxy complaints ?, ” asked Lieutenant
Cook. “No? then good-night! ” And the iron-
grating.with, its inch-thick bars, and its interstices
between the bars of two fingers’ breadth, 'was
slammed -down.
The first muster was arranged for in this wise :
Jones was to take Phillips-, Hardy, the cadaver of
West, and Tooth that of Bunt. Each was to prop
his man against the back-wall‘of the Chamber at
the foot of the shaft. And into the right hand of
every corpse bis mate and murderer was to
place a candle. Cooke counted by heads and
candles.
‘“’ErC yer, Phillips,” quoth thefacetious Jones,
“ jest yer stand there an’ answer fer yersel’. Stand
up, Isay.” He thrust the body into a more up-
right position, and pulled the dead man’s leathern
cap over the fractured skull. “’Ere; it ain’t in
’cordance with reg’lashin’s that yer ’tend muster wi’
yer cap on. If Cooke sees yer there’ll be ructions,
Phillips, ol’ man.” And he rammed the cap down
with a succession of taps.
Hardy, in killing West, had made a very
awkward job of it. The man’s head fell on his
breast, disclosing a fearful gash on the back of his
neck. Hardy shuddered for the first time, as he
pushed the head into its normal position. “ Jones,
give us a hand here, I can’t get this fellow right.”
Between them they managed at last to bolster up
the dead man with pieces of timber, so that his
attitude should not appear strange to the muster-
ing officer.
Tooth, with Bunt, was the least sixccessful of
the lot. All the spare timber had been used to
brace West up against the wall, and do what
Tooth could, he could not fix his victim in an erect
posture. Moreover, he was the only one of the
three who was at present dominated by ■ the
mystery of death. He had murdered before —
twice-and never yet had he felt that awful thrill,
which the homage of the Unconquerable Presence
seldom dmits to demand from feeble mortals as a
preliminary tribute to their own subjugation by
him. But his previous crimes had been per-
petrated, one in the open field, the other in the
mute solitudcs.qf Macquarie Harbour forests, and,
in both cases, he had fled from the bipod-dyed
spot the instant the fatal blow had been given.
Here, however, there was no possibility of fleeing
away from the place of the murder; for a Week, if
the process of decomposition did not earlier drive
the living forth from the weird companionship of
the dead, he Would be face to face with the man
he had slain. His nature Was vicious, hardened ;
but while it did not wear, on the one hand, that
indurated crust of utterly conscienceless villainy
which characterised Jones, it, on the other, lacked
that capacity for reasoning which enabled Hardy
to dissipate the superstitious notions that naturally
arose from their proximity to the Three ghast-
linesses. So, he handled Bunt shrinkingly, and
it was with a strident agony puncturing the
syllables that he cried out —“ Oh, Jones, come
here ! ”
“ Wot’s the matter, Toothy? Don’t yer like yer
job? Ain’t yer got a toothsome morsel there? ”
And then the wretch stopped short, for yet
another foul idea had been generated within that
nest of devilish inventions, his brain. If he could
only induce Tooth and Hardy to use the mur-
dered men as they had used in the Harbour
wilderness, the body of the boy who had confided
in them when they had endeavoured to escape
from Sarah Island, why, there would be all the
more rations for himself when the time came for
him to bolt. He repeated his shameful pun.
“W’y,” he chuckled hugely, “w’y, yer don’t
answer, Toothy—now, w’y shu’dn’t it be tooth-
some, Toothy, ian’ ’Ardy? It’ll save rashuns, won t
it ?”
“ No, no,” cried Tooth. “ I couldn’t abear that
’ere. Let’s ’ave none o’ that. We’ll have grub
’nough, ’sides.”
Hardy replied more slowly, as though he were
thinking carefully over the proposition. “ Well,”
lie said, “I don’t see why we shouldn’t! We
may be stuck at Pirates’ for a week or two, an’ it
mayn’t be the season for shell-fish.”
Their notion was to make for Pirates’ Bay, once
they had got out of the shaft.
“No.” roared Tooth, “no! I won’t ’ave it.
We’ll have ’nough without.”
There was a tremor that betokened abject
fear in the wretch’s voice, and Jones perforce
abandoned his latest invention. His experience
of his brother convicts warned him that when once
they became subject to superstitious terrors the
task of managing them was only to bo compassed
by great tact. “ Orl right, old boy, but we can’t
’ave too much w’en wunst we make a start. An’
now, wot is it?” Tooth motioned in reply to the
figure which would not stand, stark stiff though it
was, against the wall. “ I can’t fix ’im,” ho said.
And his frame swayed in his fear.
They had no cordage nor anything which they
could tear up into strips, except the dead men’s
clothing, so as to tie the corpse into an attitude
which would pass the muster, and Bunt would
not stand up.
Jones was in a difficulty. If the positions of the
Three did not appear natural, Lieutenant Cooke,
looking down the pit to the circle of light which
enabled him to count the men at muster, would
call them to attention and order the man whose
attitude showed disrespect to correct his posture.
He would have to salute in so doing—a regulation
rendered it imperative to salute when addressed
by a superior—and the fact that sixty feet of sunk
shaft intervened between the superior and the
prisoner did not alter the effect of the rule. Thus,
unless the men were stationed so that there would
be nothing abnormal in their aspect the suspicion
of the powers that were above might be excited,
and discovery ensue.
It was really a question of importance how to
induce the reluctant Bunt to put himself in the
appropriate attitude for muster. “ Bunt alius was
contrayry, him. I’m sure I don’t know ’ow
to straighten ’im,” Jones complained. “Stay,
tho’.” A brilliant idea struck him.
“I ’av’ it —’ere, ’old ’im a second.” And as
Tooth shiveringly seized the corpse, Jones stepped
to the corner of the chamber where they had
heaped their waist-chains. A nine-foot chain once
linked Phillips to Jones, Bunt to Tooth, West to
Hardy. This each couple had fractured among
the first preparations for their bolt, and the chains
had been thrown loosely together so that at the
nightly muster they might be handy to clank
when it was desirable to add another element of
deception to the circumstances.
“ We’ll jest fix Bunt an’ West together, back to
back. ’Ardy, jest unprop West!”
Hardy obeyed, and lifted the cadaver to the
centre of the chambei’, as motioned by his leader.
The latter went on, “Now, Toothy, drag yer man
’ere, yer fellows ’old ’em back to back and I’ll fix
’em wi’ the chains ! ” And the ingenious scoxxndrel
so adjusted the irons that the rigid figures were
linked once more in the metal embrace from which
they had freed themselves in life. Back to back
with the right arm of each holding his cand'e,
ready for ignition when they heard from above the
sounds that told of the arrival of muster-hour. A
gap of a foot’s breadth separated them from
Phillips. His bared arm likewise stood out at
right angles from the pallid trunk.
Jones stepped back a pace, and looked at the
statuesque figures. “Them’ll do—they’ll pass
muster ! Orl we’ve got to do is not rub agen ’em,
or knock ’em down, durin’ the few days we shall
be here ! We’ll hav’ter swing the baskets clear !”
* * *
They did pass muster for seven nights.
Night after night the three live men gathered
round the three dead ones, at the cry from above
ofi “ Below there ! ” Night after night they heard
the verbal tick-off of the Lieutenant-in-Command.
Night after night he asked “ Any complaints.”
Night after night either he or Page, the over-
man, shouted down that “Number Such-an-One
is short so many hundred ! You are getting
behind, Sueh-an-One ! You’d belter look out —
Inspection Sunday is getting pretty near I” Night
after night this grim farce was played, and on
successive mornings (the nightly report being
accurate as to numbers) the full rations for tho
Six came down. And day by day, the store of
rations for the bolt accumulated.
# * #
Not without interruptions, that excited
the alarm of the leader and the fears of the other
two, did the week pass, however.
First, the bodies began to decompose more
rapidly than they had feared. The air-current
that came down the ventilating shaft was in-
sufficient to prevent the vitiation of the atmos-
phere of the galleries—always bad at its best, and
Tooth and Hardy had determined to hurry on the
moment of their attempt.
“Wait ’nother night, boys!” however, urged
Jones. “ I cal’clate wi’ to-morret’s rashuns, we’ll
’ave nuff to start.” And they yielded the point,
as they had yielded others.
Next(Thursday)morningthesmellof theoharnel-
house ascended to the surface. Page noticed it,
and asked “ what Was Up?” Hardy Was slinging
a basket—Jones was guiding the rope so that the
creel in its swaying should not touch the Three —
Tooth, at momentary intervals, was shaking the
irons. Had the men been ironed and engaged at
the foot of the shaft in the Work of slittging, their
shackles and their waist-chains would, of course,
ring. Hardy amwered —“What, sir?”
“ That smell!”
The basket in Hardy’s hand twirled and twisted
in his fear. The chains fell from Tooth’s grasp,
as he cried “It’s all up!” Jones alone had his
wits about him. “Hist!” he breathed to his
companions, and then cried up the shaft, “ ’Tis
bad water, sir. It’ll be over in a hour or so, sir.”
“Oh, that’s all! No danger of flooding?”
“ None,,sir ! We can stand it an’keep it under.
Don’t want no ’sistance, sir.”
“Am glad of that, short-handed here to-day.
Signal if it comes too strong !”
And Page, troubling not to think that never
before in his experience had the mine-water given
off the effluvium of the grave, turned to other
business.
The living but half-poisoned Three gasped re-
lief as the patch of bine sky came into view un-
obscured by Page’s head and shoulders. For the
day the danger was passed but what of the
morrow ?
Jones was determined to stay. He did not tell
his mates so, for they were bent on attempting to
escape that very night. They would not risk the
morrow. Jones was, however, resolved in his
own mind to stay till the Saturday night. By
regulation the grating was on Sunday not thrown
open for an hour and a-half after the usual time.
He was anxious to achieve the advantage that
would be derived from the longer interval, i/ecou’d
breathe the odour- and live. Why shouldn’t the
others. And so—he fell sick. He was very bad.
That is to say he “ shammed Abraham ” most
successfully. “If yer want to go, ’Ardy an’
Toothy, don’t mind me ! ” he groaned. But they
dared not go without him. He was the ingenious,
the resourceful one of all the party, and to leave
him behind was to leave their brains. So they
said they would wait, and laboured during
the days that remained to fill his basket
as well as his own—and those of the Libe-
rated Three. It was strenuous their struggle;
strenuous to the point of greatness their combat
with hunger, with the noxiousness of death, with
their own nervelessness and with their own
reeling brains with the sharp lines of pain over
the eyebrows, and with the torrid burning of
their eyeballs, and with the convulsive tortures
as their bodily organs refused to perform their
offices. It was a miracle that they lived. It
would have been a mercy had the frenzy created
by the physical pangs and mental stress of their
sufferings drivefTthem to treat each other as they
had treated the First Three. Still, sustained by
the dream of freedom and on the intangible food
which Hope tendered them even in the moments of
fitter misery, the two,not only continued to exist,
but continued to work. If to do and to suffer for
Freedom’s sake are the attributes of greatness,
surely in one aspect at least these men were great.
On half-rations they existed ; on half-rations they
did double work.
But their leader, Jones, was of a different metal.
Winning them over to perfect trustfulness in him-
self and in his ingenuity, he spent the day lying
in the least foetid gallery scheming and “sham-
ming Abraham,” and the nights, such portion
of them, at least, as he did not pass in sleep, in
the mastication of a portion of the stored-up
rations. It had become impossible now to think
of weighing the food, even had the others sus-
pected him ; and so, night after night, he made a
hearty meal, and kept up his strength on some-
thing more tangible and substantial than the
elixir of Hope—not that he refused to derive
strength from that source also. During the nights
and during the days he laughed at the folly of his
companions I The only fear he had was the dread
of discovery before he could make his escape.
* # #
The others had that fear also, but in
addition, Hardy and Tooth —Hardy’s nerve and
power of reason had broken down like the other
man’s —were tormented by superstitious horrors.
That very night of the day on which it had
appeared imminent Page would discover the
murders, Tooth disturbed the galleries with
terror-stricken cries. The dead men had come to
life, he fancied, and were upon him. Jones
soothed him as well as he could, only to hear him
an hour or two later praying fervently to God to
be forgiven, “an’ he would kill no more, an’
would confess everythin’.” With the morning
light, or that faint tinge of it which penetrated to
the vitals of the earth down the shaft, Tooth
recollected himself, and he reflected that God was
less awful than the System. God, after all, was
distant, very distant, from the Pit, while the
System and the Regime were near, very near !
So, in the hours of labour, the terrors disappeared
only to come back with renewed potency in the
night-time. Tooth, that next night, cried out
that now he would bargain with the devil if he
would free him from the clutch of Bunt’s hands
which were round his throat. Then, m'ngling the
present with the past, he wanted to know why
Jones had not permitted him to eat the dead as
they had done at Macquarie Harbour ! Only an
hour before the grating was thrown open in the
morning did he fall into a delirious sleep.
Hardy, the same night, had his delusions also.
To him likewise the Three Were alive—they were
clanking their chains—they were mounting to the
pit mouth to report their own murder and to
formally complain to the Lieutenant. Then, the
phantoms, born of his fear, changed, and he was
struggling with West; West had killed him and
was doing what he himself and Jones and Tooth
had done to the boy in the Harbour wilderness.
West’s teeth were sharp, he cried, so sharp!
Once more the weii'd fancy varied, and he was
a boy playing in grassy meadows, racing down the
village street, blowing the church organ. Again,
he was in the City Town Hall before the magis-
trates, who slided, somei,' -v, into the Judges of
Assize, who were beating him with the white-
tipped wands of the Under-sheriffs. And yet
again he was fighting in the waist of the floating
hell which bears him onwards, onwards over
starlit seas and through the furnace-fires which
afflict the damned to —oh, where was he? The
horrors were grimly vivid, and alternately when
consciousness came to him with the morning light,
he blasphemed and he prayed.
# # #
Bunt the dead, Bunt the Liberated, had
(as ah’eady related) owned a watch nick—a tiny
saw filed out of the tempered steel of a watch-
spring. As leader of the Other Three, Jones had
taken possession of the nick. It was the instru-
ment of their freedom, and who was better entitled
to hold it than the captain of the party ? No one!
—said Jones. The others did not demur, for they
trusted Jones.
On the Friday night, soon after “ muster,” dur-
ing which the first Three had behaved themselves
“decently an’ in order,” as Mr. Jones observed with
delicious humour, he (Jones) chuckling inwardly,
and groaning audibly, so that his mates should not
fail to understand how painfully he toiled in their
service, mounted the gaps in the shaft to a height
, where he could conveniently attack the grating.
Before the liberation of the First Three several
wall-planks had been loosened so that when the
time for escape arrived the gaps would serve
for foothold spaces. The ascent was scaled by
the daring Jones, and the topmost of the loosened
planks was placed across the angle formed by two
walls. From this stage or bridge lie could reach
the grating.
For four llofirs he plied, with a touch as deft
and delicate as a lapidary handling a precious
stone, the minaturo saw. The under-surface only
dare he manipulate that night. The marks of
the tool, potent for liberty though they were,
were too faint to be noticed by any unsuspecting
person. Still, he thought it, best to spread a

Sickness Cured, Health Preserved, and Life Prolonged by Dr- A. Wilford Hall’s Great Hygienic Discovery.
The treatment disclosed is unfolded in the “HEALTH PAMPHLET,”—a condensed prescription of 48 pages. To read and study this pamphlet is to
gain a fund of physiological, pathological and therapeutical knowledge that a hundred times the cost of the pamphlet would not purchase from its owner could
it be inven back and blotted from bis memory.

The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
K.ev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7: _, , ' .
«< *** Touching your wonderful discovery, I take muon
pleasure in saying, 1 am delighted with its effects upon
niv svstem. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a - healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ 1 would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease. I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when Thought your pamphlet.-Your brother m
Christ, Milks Grant.”
Dr. J. W. Graves, Parsons, Kansas, writes :
1 “Dear Dr. Hall,— After a careful reading of your
pamphlet, which came to hand a few weeks ago, I became
so delighted with the far-reaching effects of its marvellous
physiological revelations, that I at once ordered six of ni\
patients, who were suffering with consumption, to com-
mence the use of the treatment. lam happy to say that
they are all improving and doing well. You have done a
great work for afflicted humanity.—Your fraternal friend,
J. \V. Graves, M.D.”
Rev. Thos. Nield, Livonia, IncL, writes :
“At the time I received your pamphlet on Health and
Longevity, I was suffering from internal piles. After
putting your treatment into practice three times bade
niy trouble good-bye, and have not felt it since. 1 have
only to add, from practical experience, during the short
time I have owned your pamphlet, that I have more faith
in vour system of treatment than in all the medicines of
all'the doctors on earth combined. —Yours very truly,
Tho*. Niilp.”
Rev. A. L. Cole, D.D., M.D., Santa Ana, Cal.,
sends his second endorsement of the new pam-
phlet after another month’s practice of the treat-
ment, as follows: —
“ Dear Dr. Hall—l have nothing to take back from
my letter as printed in the July ‘Microcosm.’ Your
treatment is the first expression of the science of thera-
peutics I have ever seen in print, or have ever put
into practice that appeals to my judgment as unquali-
fiedly rational. It goes directly to the cause of all forms,
of disease and removes it by aiding and abetting nature,
rather than provoking a conflict among the vital powers
as in the case of drug-medication. This I call genuine
remedial science. For nearly twenty-five years I have
been a consecutively tormented invalid, and I can say in
all candour and truth that the first real freedom from suf-
fering that I have experienced in all this time has been
since adopting your treatment. I rejoice beyond words
within my power of expression ; and 1 honestly believe
that under God you have done more in that pamphlet
than all the doctors of the world for the relief of suffering
humanity. The treatment in my own case is to me the
wonder of wonders ! The |4 I paid for the pamphlet was
the best spent money of my whole life. You are at liberty
to print this, which I declare to be the literal truth upon
the honour of a man and a Christian. God bless you in
your beneficent work.”—A. L. Cols.
Rev. Geo. Cook, of Millican, Texas, who was
struck with what the doctors supposed to be a
fatal paralytic shock, now sends his seventh order
for pamplilets, and writes :
“ Dear Friend, Dr. Hall,—lnclosed find the money for
three more pamphlets with pledges signed My health is
now quite restored. Others here who have sent for the
pamphlet are just beginning to try the treatment, and
all are pleased with it. 1 will report further soon, and
send for a number of pamphlets. —Yours truly, Oeoßar,
Cook."
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a gra in of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be ma'ntained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Dr. J. M, Peebles, whose Sanitorium, as the
centre of his enormous medical practice, is at
Hammonton, N.J., and who admittedly is one of
the most learned physicians and surgeons now
living, has sent for our pamphlet and has received
it as a physiological revelation. He writes :
“ Your health pamphlet dropped in upon me like a
healing ray of sunshine. I read it with avidity, and at
once put your treatment into practice, and it is scarcely
necessary to say I found it all you recommended it to be
and more. It is not only pathological, physiological, and
hygienic, but rational. Already have I derived great
personal benefit from your discovery.—Truly yours, J.
M. Peebles, M.D.”
[Dr. Peebles is a graduate of several medical collegesi
has circumnavigated the earth three times in the interests
of therapeutical and pathological science, and is the
author of eleven volumes on the subject, the last being
“How to Live a Century and Grow Old Gracefullya
work which we have read with profound interest. The
indorsement of our pamphlet and treatment by such a
distinguished authority surely needs no comment.]
Rev. M. Ferusler, Scliafferstown, Pa., writes :
“Dr. A. Wilford Hall. Dear Sir, —Since receiving
your pamphlet I have carefully tested your treatment
upon myself. For more than twenty years 1 have been a
sufferer. My trouble has been torpid liver, indigestion,
pain across the kidneys, at times dizziness, with
occasional heart trouble, &c. With gladness unspeakable
I assure you I already find myself almost a new man ; and
l oan'never pay the debt of gratitude I owe you for the
blessing you have conferred upon me. I want to help
spread the knowledge of this discovery, and if you will
send me ’some blank Pledges of Honor I will let my
afflicted neighbours know about the great remedy that is
in store for them.—Yours very truly. M. Fseeslbr."
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT,
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment-
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following ;
***** “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid-restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time—forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.— R. F. Stevens, M.D.”
Rev. M. A. Smith, pastor M.E. Church, South,
at McAlester, Ind. Ter., writes :
“ Inclosed please find signed pledge of Rev. W. H.
Hicks, our Congregational minister, and the money for
his pamphlet. * * * I am not a bit surprised to see in
the June ‘Microcosm’ the wonderful things your new
discovery is accomplishing for those who have tried the
treatment. I want to tell you with tears of joy what it
has done for my wife. For about a year she has been
regarded as a hopeless consumptive. Our physicians had
given her up as incurable. She had patiently and reso-
lutely tried all sorts of medicines recommended by
different friends, when your pamphlet arrived. She at
once read it with me, and we became fully convinced as
to the soundness of your reasoning. Without loss of time
. she proceeded tp adopt your remedy, and now what words
can 1 employ to express our happiness over the result?
* * She commenced to improve in strength and flesh
immediately, and so marvellous has been the change that
she’now -weighs as much as ever she did ! Praise God,
and thanks to you, Dr. Hall. The dark cloud has h.eon
lifted from our sky. —Your grateful friend. M. A. Smith.
Alison 0. Roe, Esq., Buchanan, Miob., writes:
“Dear Dr. Hall,—l have received and read your won-
derful pamphlet on health and longevity. I am very
thankful that I was somewhat acquainted with your
writings, having read the' ‘ Problem of Human Life ’ and
some numbers of the earlier volumes of the ‘ Microcosm.’
Had I not known of you through your previous dis-
coveries in science I fear I should have given little atten-
tion to this great and priceless physiological discovery
which is destined to do so much for suffering humanity.
You will hear from me again soon.—Respectfully yours,
Alisok C. Rott.”

handful of coal-dust over the almost imperceptible
cuts. With one hand gripping the bars, he used
the saw with the other. The exertion was not
great —but the mental strain, as the saw refused
now and then to “ bite ” and he had to withdraw
it to feel, with his townie , if the serration was still
perfect, wasteirible. He could not trust the horny
surface of his hand to tell if the teeth were still un-
broken and unblunted, so he passed the saw across
his tongue at interval*. At the end of the four
hours, there was but the slightest dulling to be
distinguished. He thanked God that the man
who had made the saw had been so eminent a
workman.
He descended to assure his comrades that all
was well. He had done half the job—had sawn
half-through all of the bars requisite to be with-
drawn to permit egress.
“ ’Tis orl right, ol’ pals !—orl right ! The nick ’ll
keep good! ”
“Thank God ! ” exclaimed Hardy.
“That’s wot I sez!” responded the leader.
“ Amen! Say Amen, Toothy !”
“Amen !” cried Tooth.
# * *
On the Saturday, the baskets went up very
indifferently laden. “ It’s lucky for you, boys, ’
cried Overman Page, “ that to-morrow ain’t In-
spection ! Now, if you don’t want to be dosed,
ye’ll ha’ to be brisk this next fortnight! ” The
remark was received with silent laughter by the
Other Three.
“ Lor’! won’t they be savage w’en they finds as
’ow there’ll be nobody to flog for a-bein’ short.
Bet yer a ’arf rashun to nothink, Toothy, that jest
out o’ spite they flogs the stiffs ! I say, Phillips,
ol’ boy, ’ud the cat ’nrt yer much now ? Tell us,
pal, tell us! Or, is it that there ain’t no cat in
’ell ? ’As the System got a monerp’ly in oats ?
Tell us, ol’ chap.” Thus the pleasant-tempered
Jones. But Phillips would not answer.
# # *
They prepared the First Three for their
final muster. Which was also to be their own
final muster.
And when the grating was slammed down and
the “Good-night!” said, they began to prepare
for their escape.
“I’m agoin’ up to file t’other part o’the bars,
pals. W’ile I’m ’way, d’yer get out th’ grub an’
pack it in th’ shirts.”
For use, on Inspection-Sundays only, each man
had a shirt. These, Jones had designed, should
be employed to carry the stock of rations.
He went up. “Stand from below!” he cried,
when he reached the first loose plank. He threw
it down. “No need now,” he laughed, “to put
’em back. Keep from under, pals—in case I might
’urt yer!” The tender considerateness of his
accents!
Plank after plank he threw down—some struck
the carrion which had been the First Three,
Others fell clear of the carcases. And as each
plank fell, he mounted higher.
For five hours he worked. It was the deep of
night when he cut through the last bar. He had
sawn through eight. An aperature of two feet in
width was left. That was enough for him to get
out of, he reflected, and if it was too narrow for
the others, perhaps they might not need to use it
after all. As he withdrew the bars, he slid them
on top of the grating—save one. Then he re-
turned.
At the bottom he found his pals waiting for him
in gruesome silence. Kach was glaring at the
other with an unspoken thought in his eye.
“Wot’sup, pals? W’y ain’t the grub packed
up?”
Hardy spoke. “The meat’s bad —tainted, all
gone ! ”
Tooth spoke. “ ‘Tis a-lon’ of them 'Stiffs !
We’re goin’ to starve arter all —we can’t bolt on
meal an’ candles ! ”
Jones did not speak for some time. He was
stunned, apparently. Of course it was only
apparently—he had known the fact for days !
“That’s bad, boys! I ’spose nothink can be,
done?” He crouched into No. 5 gallery, “the
Store,” as though to taste the meat.
Hardy followed him, after a minute’s lapse,
and, stooping closely over him, whispered :
“ We’d better do for Tooth, Jones ! He’s weak
—and we’ll want all grub for oursell’s ! ”
Jones replied in the same tone. “Sh, ’Ardy!
Let’s play fair ! We’ve all a-tak n the oath ! ”
Then he went into the chamber, telling Hardy
to pick out the less corrupt of the meat.
In the chamber, Tooth whispered to him,
“Jones ! ” he pleaded, “let’s kill Hardy ! You
an’ me’ll go, Jones ! We’ll ’ave ’nough then ! ”
“ Oh, be fair, Toothy, sonny ! ’Member we’ve
taken the oath ? Let’s play fair ! ”
The loyalest of creatures, Jones !
# * *
“ Who’s to go first ? ” queried the General
—never a greater General than when he put the
question!
“W’y you, o’ course, Jones—youve done all
th’ work,” Tooth replied. Hardy did not dissent.
“ As yer please, boys! Then which’ll go next?
Yer’d better draw the straw.”
He pulled from a slab two splinters of unequal
length, and held out their ends to his companions.
“ Draw together—shortest goes nex’ ter me.”
It was Hardy’s fate ! Had he drawn the other
he’d have died with one murder the less to his
account.
» # •
With a bag of provisions round each of
their necks, they began the ascent. They had
propped the First Three up again, and used them,
in all their noxious corruption, as aids in their
exodus. “We’ve helped ’em to Freedom,” com-
mented Jones, “ ’tis only right they should give
us a leg up.”
Half-way up, Jones stopped. ‘ Plenty o time,
boys. No hurry ! An’ yer’d better ’and me yer
bag, ’Ardy—l’m stronger ’n you. ’Old tight ter
lne —w’iles yer looses it! ” Hardy—fool! —obeyed.
Ten feet higher, Jones paused again.
“ Toothy, ’and yer bag to ’Ardy. W’iles yer
does it I’ll climb an’ jest put my grub outside—
I’ll be freer to ’elp yer.” They trusted him still—
and while he clambered up, Tooth passed his bag
to Hardy. Jones went back to where he had left
them.
“ Steady, lads, for the last tussle ! Don t lose
’art now, pals ! An’ keep a clear ’ead.”
They had left one solitary dip to light them in
their ascent. It was the merest flicker that
reached them at this forty-feet stage ; it showed
them each other’s outlines, that was all. Had the
flame been brighter, perhaps Hardy would have
seen Jones’ face, and Tooth, Hardy’s, and each
had then been warned.
A few feet higher—and Jones, holding tightly to
a plank-rim by one hand, lowered his head till he
reached Hardy’s.
‘bNow, ’Ardy, stash ’im with yer foot—we want
orl th’ grub for oursel’s !”
The devilish hint spoke Hardy’s own mind.
He thrust one of his feet downwards—and with a
horrid yell, Tooth was—liberated. The light
went out.
* • «
“ Well done, ’Ardy ! An’ now it’s me
an’you.”
The accent of approbation changed in its breath-
ing into one of menace. And with the change
fell, on Hardy’s head, a blow with a cut bar. At
least, it had been intended for his head, but,
through the going-out of the light, the blow was
misdirected, and slipped on his shoulder.
JHardy shrieked “God! That’s your playin’
fair, is it! But if I go, ye’ll go to.”
lie sprang upwards—the instinct of vengeance
guided him aright in the darkness —and he clutched
tile waist-band of Jones’ trousers. One awful
struggle in mid-air, and
The rest of the Other Three were liberated.

The Soul-Waves of Electricity.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Edison himself will tell you that he can-
not define what Electricity is - the actual essence
itself. He can produce it. He can control it.
He can juggle with it. But he can not define it.
Faraday averred that “the education of the
judgment has for its first and last step- Humility.
Hence, even when Science holds .a theory to be-
absolutely demonstrated, the searcher after true
knowledge should not scorn any new light, no
matter how ridiculous that light may appear, nor
how unexpected its source. In relation to the
actual essence of Electricity, no theory has been
absolutely demonstrated; therefore,' the reason is
greater for admitting new light from any and
every source. I even ask Edison himself, that
unparalleled electric magician, to practise humility
enough towards the new truths concerning Elec-
tricity which it has been my good fortune to learn
and to prove, .
Science speaks of the Electric Fluid. I make
bold to assert that there is no such thing.
I undertake to demonstrate that Electricity is
not a Fluid, but belongs to the Animal Kingdom
—to that Wonderland of Bacteriology which the
microscope has revealed.
Can a Fluid feel ? Can a Fluid shriek with
fear, or thrill with joy, or dance with mixed sen-
timents? Electricity can do and does all these
things. .
These functions belong to the Animal Kingdom.
What we term the Electric Spark is in reality a
Bacillum. What we term the Electric Fluid ’ is a
continuous line of Bacilli, each transmitting on-
wards the sensations it receives—passing along
the joke, or the agony, so to speak.
Let me christen the Electric Bacillum. I will
call it the Electrobe.
The Electrobe is the child of the acidulated
loves of the metals.
I iThere are male and female Electrobes —answer-
ing to negative and positive poles of a magnet.
The female —the Electrobess —is the positive.
Females always are positive. ...
The average Electrobe is the 170-millionth part
of an inch in length. (This for another paper, by
the way.) ,
# # *
I had often pondered on Electricity, and»
till two years ago, considered it to be an invisibl 6
fluid, answering to the laws of fluids generally’
except as to foaming over and spilling—like beer.
After two years of investigation (the experiments
are too numerous to enumerate here), I became
convinced of this extraordinary fact —
Electricity has feelings of its own.
Just fancy billions and trillions of Electrobes
thrilling along inside telegraphic wires at the rate
of 00,000 miles per minute, bearing with them
burdens of woe, gladness, and hypocrisy, poli-
ticians’ speeches, market reports, sensational
news of the day, and the “ wind and weather
to say nothing of tall lying and other O.H.M.S.
business — and understanding and feeling it all!
To prove my discovery to the world was my
next task. Its’truth was absolutely clear to me,
but that was not sufficient. It was imperative
that a hard and sceptical world should have the
truth demonstrated by authenticated experi-
ment before a Scientific Committee of unassailable
reputation and acknowledged judgment.
* * *
I enlisted the sympathy and aid of Pro-
fessor Dorn, of Galvano House, Spark-street, Syd-
ney. He had all sorts of gear; 1 had all sorts of
ideas.
The plan was to test my assertion that Elec-
trobes were animal organisms with sentient
emotions. In other words, we determined to ob-
tain visible evidence of the Soul-Wares of Elec-
tricity. To do this we proposed to pass telegraphic
messages through the head of a man utterly
ignorant of the Morse Code, and to note his
sensations. For this purpose it was only necessary
to place the man on an insulating stand, and make
the fitting “connections.”
In our desire that our experiments should be
absolutely unchallengeable, we became aware at
once of a difficulty. How send the messages ? So
subtle an agent as Electricity might be affected
in its Emotions by the magnetic communicability
of the operator, who might be a sensitive man
himself and variably affected by the messages he
had to read before he could transmit. He might
thrill over a love-coo, or shudder over a death-
rattle, and his feelings might impregnate the
Electrobes, and the insulated recipient might mis-
take the operator’s barometer of feelings for the
genuine emotions of the Electrobes. A human
operator might do his work unevenly—thump
harder on emphatic passages and flow easily on
sentimental themes. He might have the jerks !
That would spoil all, and the man on the insulated
stand would be translating the spasms of O.P., or
tanglefoot, instead of the esoteric Soul-Waves of
the Electrobes.
We had to invent. (We are still inventing.)
* * *
The Morse Alphabet consists of dots and
dashes arranged in various combinations. Thus —
spells “ fool.” (No personal reflections intended.)
These dots and dashes are, with ordinary tele-
graphic instruments, made on paper “tape” by
means either of an ink disc, or by indentations
with a blunt pricker, the “tape” being guided
automatically between small rollers, a clockwork
arrangement keeping things going. The dots and
dashes are made by “making” and “breaking”
circuit, by the operator tapping a knob, or
‘‘key.”
We proposed to rig up a Morse Catagraph of a
number of previously-concocted messages. We
had a tin-foil tape made.
Then an assistant manufactured a pair of rollers
slotted by the most elaborate care with all the
letters of the Morse Alphabet. (Any mechanic
can imagine the machine.) From these rollers
another assistant marked the tinfoil “ tape ” with
a string of impressions, representing letters, and
forming up into the required messages. He
marked our tin-foil in such a way that, instead of
an indentation on one side and a bulging on the
other for each dot or dash, there was a “blister”
on each side—like the blobs on sprays of crackling
seaweed.
(N.B. —This is a very curious and ingenious
machine, and we have had it patented. It would
puzzle our beat mechanics to know how we fixed
up these mutually contradictory “double-con-
vexers.:’)
The object of all this was that the “tape”—
with embossed messages, prepared after the fashion
of the indentations on a phonograph—should
itself, in the passing between rollers, work the
instrument without any tapping by hand of a key-
should itself “make” and “break” circuit in
the rhythmic time of the desired messages. We
fixed the gearing so that a cog moving out set the
clockwork going—the cog falling back into dove-
tail stopped it. The whole to be worked from an
electric-ba f tery known as an “accumulator” —
to popular vision, a glass-jar of black liquid—
“Bottled Lightning,” in fact—and which was
all ready for action, the only preliminary being
the letting drop into the Bottled Lightning the
loose end of a copper wire, which was attached to
all the other apparatus. Directly the wire touched
the liquid a circuit was completed, chemical
action was instantaneous, and the Eleotrobes
let joy be unconfined, and went on with the
dance.
* * #
Next to choose an Interpreter, -who, in the
cause of science, would permit Bottled Lightning
to be “dot-dashed ” through his brain-pan.
Two conditions were necessary in the Interpre-
ter:—(1) He must be absolutely ignorant of
telegraphy, so as to stop the months of the
scoffers, who might argue that, since some opera-
tors can “read” by “sound,” an operator might
also “ read ” by “ touch,” and that, by timing the
jerks through his head, the Interpreter might
become absolutely aware of the word mg of each or
any message. (2) He must be of sensitive organi-
sation and responsive to the most subtle Soul-
W aves.
We obtained just the man we wanted. A Poet.
An ignorant Poet. Yet a Poet who could thrill
over the parting of a bald man. Our only fears
now vanished. If mischance should overtake the
interpreter—well, it didn’t matter if we did kill
this kind of Poet.
The Poet signed a statutory declaration that he
had never seen a telegraph-instrument before, and
that he knew nothing of the Morse Code, but a
lot about the Remorse one. I have that statutory
declaration by me, but it is too long to publish.
Moreover, it is in verse.
# # *
The experiment.
The blobbed tinfoil “tape” was “ placed ” by
an assistant. So was the Poet. The latter was
fastened down in a chair on a glass stand, six
inches off the floor. A wire led from the tele-
graphic-instrument to his poetic brow, to which it
was clamped. Another wire led from the back of
his neck —the Cervical Plexus —and returned to
the battery, thus completing the circuit.
Present: Prof. Dom, M.A.X.E. ; Dr. Switch,
U.M. Sc. ; Messrs. Freischbrouschz, Greenmug,
Peeringheuser, Suckerling, Smith (J.H.E.), Oon-
ninghaver and Grunger—all well-known sci< nlists
—and myself. At the special request of the Poet,
the Press was not admitted.
“ Are you ready ?” asked Professor Dom.
“ Gimme another fortifier, and ” (gurgle,
gurgle) replied the Poet.
“ Off she goes,” and the Professor dropped the
loose end of copper-wire into the Bottled Light-
ning.
# # #
“ I feel it,” said the Poet. “ It’s a hoity-
toity affair I should say—a sort of ‘ wonder how
he’ll take it ?’ Now she’s smooth again.”.
The Professor pulled out the loose copper-end,
the cog-wheel slipped back into dovetail, .and. the
instrument stopped. The message wks read :—.
“ Dear Professor. Please lend me five pounds.”
“ I felt it was something dubious,” said the
Poet.
The savans looked surprised, but did not con-
sider that anything had been proved, so far.
“ Proceed,” said I.
• * *
“ Hi tiddly hi ti!” buzz-sawed the Poet.
“ This is gay. Whatever can it be? The fluid is
dancing along as merry as an escaped thrush.”
Message: “My poor Charlie. Your wife’s
mother passed away last night. Break the news
gently to Irene.”
“ Wonderful! Astounding !” cried the savants,
who had been there themselves.
“Next,” I said, laconically.
* # *
“Don’t feel anyhow,” murmured the
Poet. “ Seems to me, though, there’s mixed
liquors about, but not enough to scare me.”
Telegram: “After the tea-meeting and ad-
dresses, meet me at the old Lodge-rooms, you
know where. —Yours, Drymug.”
The savants passed this over in silence.
* * *
“ Fair Yenus !” cried the Poet, raptur-
ously. “ Queen of Beauty, I invoke thee in song—
Would the tuneful Muses deign
Now to consecrate my strain,
I’d at once— —
“ Ouch !”
So sang and so abruptly broke off the Poet.
It was found that he had been receiving a love-
message, followed, without a break, by a warrant
for arrest.
The savants were almost convinced.
« # #
A gloom now camq over the Poet, ITis
eyes lost their lustrous frenzy, his whole mien be-
tokened dejection, and he wept. Suddenly, his
mood changed. He attempted to leap out of his
lashings and he literally roared, with savage
rage—“It’s a crimson, envious, black-souled,
Stygian lie! M
“ What is ? ” asked Dr. Switch.
“How should I know?” screamed the Poet;
“ What’s the infernal apparatus running on now?”
Pro. Dom {reading) : “The idiot trussed up on
the electric stand fancies he’s a poet because he
wears long hair, looks bilious, and gets drunk;
He can’t sell his slush anywhere, but pays to hate
his rot published as advertisements.”
“ It’s a beetle-browed, spotted-snaked, crimson-
starred, milky-wayed, Babylonish lie ! ” yelled

succeeded in explaining to him that I had to do
something rough in order to convince the Com-

emotions ? ” I asked, turning to the confabulating

The Emotional and Animal Entity of
Electricity—the segregation of the Electrobe—is
thus a proved fact. Observe the precautions
taken to prevent human mesmeric contact with
the Interpreter. The unimpassioned hands of
outside metal-workers slotted one machine; an
unimaginative assistant “ blobbed ” out the tinfoil
“tape” in its devised mechanism; the whole
experiment was worked by lifting in and out of
the Bottled Lightning a loose end of copper-wire,
the part handled by Professor Dom being, of
course, insulated in guttapercha—yet the Inter-
preter experienced sensations answering to the
wording —the meaning —of the messages sent. The
inference is irresistible. The Poet but interpreted
the emotions of the Electrobes, which understood
the messages.
What fresh magic of sympathy must now be
woven into the Telegraph Department, when we
consider how much these Electrobes suffer! It is

THE DIPSOMANIAC.


Mr. Samuel John Sutton.
Mr. Samuel John Sutton, whose por-
trait appears on this page, is, without flattery,
one of the “ Men of Mark ”of Tasmania. Essen-
tially a self-made man, he has, by his intelligence,
integrity and admirable tact, worked his way
amongst his own countrymen ; being a native of
Hobart, he migrated at an early age to the north
of the island, made Launceston his home, and
|l'om that day to this, all his energies have tended
to the development and to promote the welfare o
that city, of which he has been Mayor for the last
two consecutive years. Whenever a meeting is
called for a good purpose, or a scheme propounded
for the good of the country or its people, S. j!"
Sutton’s name is to the fore. He initiated the
idea of holding a Tasmanian Exhibition over two
years ago. After building the magnificent Albert
Hall, and when the annexes were being proceeded
with, the disastrous labour strikes in Australia
“crushed” the proposed Exhibition— not, how-
ever, the spirit of the promoter. Six months ago>
Mr. Sutton not only revived the project, but
enlarged its scope. The Tasmanian Exhibition,
which will be opened on the 25th of November,
will add another to the many claims that gentle-
man has on the gratitude of his fellow-colonists.
At the general elections, held in the early part of
June, the electors gave a proof of their full
appreciation of Mr. Sutton’s work, when they
placed him at the head of the poll for South
Launceston.
PLAN OF CITY PARK AND BUILDINGS.
Tasmanian Exhibition.
To be Held at Launceston in the
Summer of 1891-2.
ELEVATION OF ALBERT HALL.
We have very much pleasure in placing before
our readers a plan of the Tasmanian Exhibition
and City Park from drawings prepared by Mr.
A. E. Luttrell, Architect, of Cameron-street,
Launceston. The management is in the hands of
Air. Jules Joubert, whose name alone is a guaran-
tee that the Exhibition will be a success. The
main entrance is from Tamar-street through City
Park, and then through the Old Pavilion, which
is being renovated and altered into a splendid
fernery. The Main Avenue is 25ft. wide and
extends from end to end of the building, and the
whole of the British, Foreign, Intercolonial, and
asmanian Courts have a frontage on to this
a\enue. A specially-built Art Gallery, adjoined
to the Tasmanian Juvenile Court, with an area of
over 4000 ft., makes provision for fine arts. The
1 . achinei 'y Court is at the extreme end and is
connected to the Government railways by a line
° rails. An idea of the magnitude of the Tas-
manian Exhibition Buildings may be formed by
a glance at the ground-plan we have laid before
our readers. The Exhibition Buildings are shown
on one side of the City Park, covering an
area of some 13 acres, which the citizens of
Launceston have every reason to be proud
of, and which they have graciously granted to
the Exhibition Commissioners for the .purposes
of the Exhibition, This in itself should ensure the
success of the undertaking. The contractors for
the annexes, Messrs. J. and T. Gunn, are pushing
on with the work. The whole concern will be
complete long before opening day, and in this
matter the management are to be congratulated
for there is nothing so detrimental to the opening
of an Exhibition as “hurry and bustle.” From the
promptitude and courtesy with which Mr. Herbert
A. Percy, the secretary, answers all communica-
tions, applications for space are being applied for
daily. The faict that the undertaking having such
a representative in Europe as Sir Edward
Braddon, the Agent-General for Tasmania, has
been the means of inducing many noted manu-
facturers to apply for space. Among the colonies
a good deal is being done by private enterprise, the
Exhibition having official agents in each colony;
we fear, however, that comparatively little will be
done in this direction until the various Govern-
ments decide on the appointment of commissions
with the necessary means to provide representative
displays of the arts, products, and manufactures
peculiar to each, some of the colonial Governments
are under the false impression that this Exhibition
is a private enterprise; to all intents and purposes
it is quite as much a Government affair as
the Melbourne Centennial, and much more so
than the Great London Exhibition of ’5l; the
grant by the Government to pay for all the
annexes, and the main building having been
erected by the Launceston City Council at a cost
of some £10,009. Whilst all official oommunica-
tions have been made through the Tasmanian
Government inviting the colonies to be repre.
sented, and last, though not least, all the profits
arising from the Exhibition are to be applied to
the embellishment of the City of Launceston, and
not divided amongst the shareholders or promo-
ters, as it was at the New Zealand and South Seas
Exhibition last year, where, nevertheless, the
whole of the colonies were officially represented,
and the public money voted will surely convince
u i i .
the local governments in Australia that they
might take part officially in this Exhibition-
From a business point of view it may be fairly
argued that Tasmania has a just call upon her
Australian neighbours, considering the liberal way
in which she was represented at the Sydney and
Melbourne Exhibitions, but more especially when
we consider the following authentic customs
returns, which show that Victoria sends annually
three-quarters (|) of a mijlion worth of commo-
dities, and New South Wales £192,764, whilst
other natural products from Tasmania find
their way to Victoria and New South Wales
amounting to £i, 179,0i1; let these figures be 6om
pared with Tasmania’s trade with Great Britain
tke imports amounting to £577,680, and the ex-
P° r t s £251,835, so that in reality Tasmania is the
customer Australia can possibly deal with,
Another glance at the elevation and ground plan
Albert Hall or Permanent building which
was mooted by the City Council for the purposes of
the exhibition. This structure consists of numer-
ous anc * room y offices together with a large hall
which, for size and acoustic properties, compares
most favourably with the largest halls in the
world, its capacity placing it as the eleventh as
compared with others of a like nature. Wo cannot
conclude without wishing the Tasmanian people
every success in their undertaking.

The Distribution of Wages—The
Bachelor.
Dear Bulletin, — If it be admitted that barely
sufficient wealth is produced on this oblate
spheroid which wo inhabit to supply the wants of
all its inhabitants, and if it be further admitted
that one great cause—indeed, the secondary cause
—of poverty is the unequal distribution of that
wealth, then it is surely evident that any attempt
to improve the prevailing distributive system, or
to show how it might be advantageously altered,
must prove beneficial to the bulk of the com-
munity. Undoubtedly the principal absorbers of
the wealth which ought to be fairly shared among
all are the monopolists, but even that portion of
wealth which, under the name of wages, escapes
their greedy grip, is unequally apportioned among
those who lay claim to it. Now, it having been
acknowledged that the food supply is limited,
and that unfair distribution is one cause of
poverty, it must be conceded that the system,
which pays the labourer simply according to the
amount and quality of his work, while totally
ignoring his liabilities and responsibilities, is
unjust and productive of much evil.
# # #
On arriving at manhood, the earnings of the
young worker are usually greatly increased, but
should he then, obeying the promptings of Nature,
take unto himself a wife, thus increasing his
expenditure at least 50 per cent., no additional
allowance is made. Should his wife, in obedience
to the teachings of Holy Wr.t and natural law,
from time to time augment the population, thus
increasing his expenditure at least 10 per cent, per
annum on the amount requisite for his support
alone, still no further increase to his income is
made. The man who served his apprenticeship
alongside of him, who attained journeyman’s
wages at the same time, has remained unham-
pered, has given no “hostages to fortune,” and
accordingly has not a tithe of his responsibilities
and outlets for expenditure, yet is paid at the same
rates. Should the bachelor be saving and long-
headed, he can not only put by a pound or two
weekly, but, by judicious investment, may become
ip a few years an employer of labour himself. No
such door of esaape is open to the married pro-
ducer who has a large family,; he is over-
weighted, completely handicapped out of the
race of life. Should the bachelor be fond
of amusement, he can “fly round and see
life,” while the married drudge has not only all the
joy crushed out of his existence, but is positively
in many cases unable to provide his growing little
ones with healthy accommodation, sufficient
nutriment, and the careful training necessary to
the formation of good citizens. Is this fair?
Should not the earnings of the married toiler be
increased in direct proportion to the number of his
family, even if the receipts of the bachelor have
to be curtailed somewhat in consequence ?
* # #
Here the single man, who is selfish, illogical,
and unphilosophical, interjects—“ That would be
unfair; Ido just as much work as paterfamilias;
I demand the same wages.” Of course the stupid
man does not understand the matter; it is not a
matter of remuneration, not a dispute between
man and man ; it is a matter of necessities—one
between mouth and mouths, between back and
backs. Has the single man more bread and butter
than he can eat, more clothing than he can wear,
or their monetary equivalent?—if so, he is
depriving those, mayhap unwittingly, who have
not enough of these necessaries of what
they are justly entitled to, from the mere
fact of their existence. If the grasping
bachelor is enabled through the folly of existing
social conditions to overfill his dehiscent maw
by intercepting that food which would otherwise
reach starving stomachs, it is surely time that
system was renounced in favour of a more humane
and less fatuitous one. Moreover, if we consider
the community aright, it will be seen that it is
nothing more nor less than a huge family, and that
many of the social evils arise from neglect to take
this into account. Viewed from this standpoint,
it will be seen that the children of each family are
the sons or daughters of every grown-up person in
the community, the brothers or sisters of all the
rest. Until this be fully recognised, the ill-fed,
ill-housed, ill-educated, ill-reared youth of each
generation must become a source of never-ending
expense, a pestilence, a curse to the generation
that follows.
• * •
You, the clamorous, responsibility - shirking
bachelor, are the cause of much of the misery we
have to face. For those denied by you, and
such as you, the opportunities to become good
citizens, we build gaols, erect gallows, and whip-
ping posts. For those whom your companion-
ship has ruined, we build hospitals, benevo-
lent asylums, lying-in institutions, and found-
ling homes. In order that your animal pro-
pensities may be indulged, oh, brutish bachelor,
our streets are.nightly thronged with those for
whom no gladsome wedding-day will ever dawn,
for whom, through your greed, the door of no
honourable occupation may ever be opened. Yet,
oh whited sepulchre, you dare to say that pater-
familias should be compelled to support the results
of his marital felicity, while knowing that your
action denies him the wherewithal, meanwhile
complacently deeming that the State is bound to
provide for the victims of your unhallowed inter-
course and economic thefts. It avails you not to
say that all married people are not chaste. Your
action in remaining single, in evading responsi-
bilities, in taking that to which others have a
better claim, is to a great extent the source of all
immorality. Were the community’s offspring
reared properly, there would be fewer victims
ready to fall a prey to your fleshly desires, and
thus nature would compel you also to marry, and
accordingly by means of early marriages the State
would not be unduly taxed for the support of
these institutions which your profligacy makes
necessary.
* * #
Besides, the bachelor does not directly pay a fair
quota towards the expenses of the State and
municipality in which he resides, for he contributes
but little towards the payment of rates, and the
other burdens which fall on the shoulders of the
house-occupier and tax-payer.
# # #
That the share of wealth received by the married
man should be greater than that apportioned to
the bachelor is as necessary in a civilised State as
in a barbarous one. Here we may learn much
from the savages who divide the spoils of the
chase, and the foray among the tribe in direct
proportion of food to mouths, not so much con-
sidering who did the work as who possesses the
appetite. Surely, if it be admitted that the land-
lords, usurers and monopolists, absorb an undue
amount of the common stock of nutriment, it
must also be acknowledged that the bachelor
withdraws from the general fund more than twice
what is absolutely i-equired for his support, while
creating by his profligacy evils for whose allevia-
tion the necessary funds are subscribed by
the entire community. Denying his obliga-
tion to contribute towards the support of
the community’s young, he carefully spreads
the weight of his obligations over the
shoulders of all. “ Bear ye one another’s
burdens,” said the founder of Christianity, but
the bachelor not only absolutely refuses to bear
the burdens of others, but undeniably shirks the
full weight of his own.
# # #
If the appearances of possessors of labour-power
in the labour-market are to be regularly sustained, i
then the present sellers of this force must be
afforded healthy opportunities for perpetuating
themselves. Labour-power continually withdrawn
by tear and wear must be as continuously replaced
in quantities at least equal to that withdrawn:
hence the sura of the means necessary for
the production of labour-force must, if only
for economic reasons, include the means neces-
sary for the support of future labourers. Thus
the married producer performs a dual duty; he
not only labours for the support of the community,
but has a mighty trust in his hands as the rearer
of the future generation. He is working, not only
for the present generation, but also for the next;
yet the shallow and unthinking bachelor fails to
see this, and would fain deny the father’s right to
receive more from the common fund than he does,
not that he personally has not enough, but from
a dog-in-the-manger desire to hold on to as much
as he can. What is required is not so much a tax
on bachelors, not so much a diminution of the
earnings of single men, as an increase of the pay
of the married producers. If their pay cannot be
increased, then let the few suffer in order that the
entire coim* unity may be benefited. Then if the
single man desires to be put on an equal footing
with other men, his remedy is at hand while there
is a single girl in the community.
* # *
Until it is universally recognised that each
member of the community is to a great extent
dependent on every other, and that the ill-health
and discomfort of one must be detrimental to the
good health and happiness of all, progress will
ever be delayed. Surely it is the duty of each
generation, as trustees for the next, to hand over
to them fuller liberties than they inherited, more
happiness,' more opportunities of acquiring scien-
tific and general information. Until this be fully
acknowledged the selfish man will continue to
grab all he can, without considering that someone
may be more in want of it, and thus the criminal
ranks of each generation will continue to be
recruited from that which preceded it, thus will
the present system of distribution continue to
create prostitutes and weaklings, while overbur-
dened parents are hurried out of the world leaving
behind them ill-trained, half-grown orphans to
become a burden on the State. Is it any wonde r
that marriage is not a popular institution ? Is it
surprising that so many refuse to accept its cares,
its responsibilities, recognising that the sexual
pleasures on which it is founded can be enjoyed
at the public expense ? Surely not! Until some-
thing is done to popularise marriage the “Social
Evil” will flourish, criminals‘will abound, and
the coming of the millennium be indefinitely post-
poned. The Neo-Malthusians are, so far, the
only body who have dealt with the question from
the standpoint of present cofiditions, and there-
fore their doctrines are worthy of consideration.
Future reforms may wipe away any necessity foi
interference in this matter, but under existing
social conditions a re-dutribution of the earnings
of labour, giving a greater share to the more
heavily burdened would be beneficial. Mean-
while, force and stupidity govern the world until
right and intelligence are ready to assume the
sway.—Yours,
PATERFAMILIAS.
“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains>
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by compar.ng
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They ai’e now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of, pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress ; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted'in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE, —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugf.lmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine ivithout it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased cbming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as even'
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
