The School Song
Which is the best school song ever written ?
This question has been exercising the minds
of verse-writers recently, as the Old Col-
legians’ Association of Melbourne Scotch
College has been offering substantial prizes
for the best song sent in for that school. As
would be expected by everyone with experi-
ence of prize competitions, the result has
been a large crop of mediocre songs: “Caval-
leria liusticana” remains the one master-
piece of art hitherto produced by a prize
competition of this nature. It may be laid
down as axiomatic that the real school song-
will not be produced by means of a competi-
tion. but that, like all great literary work,
it will proceed spontaneously from some
beautiful nature exquisitely moved. Such a
result we see in, poems like “Clifton Chapel”
by Henry Newbolt, which, of course, is not a
school song and yet seems to combine most
of the essential characteristics.
What are these characteristics? The pro-
moters of the competition referred to asked
for “something that would appeal to the
heart of the boy and yet linger in the mind
of the man.” Rather a tall order. Yet it
is exactly this that characterises the great
school songs of the mother country. No
verse-writer holds a truer dominion over the
mind of the present-day boy than does Henry
Newbolt, and it is to his renowned song
that one naturally turns when seeking to
pluck the heart out of the mystery of the
great school song:—
It's good to see the school we knew,
The land of youth and dream,
To greet again the rule we knew
Before we took the stream.
Though long we’ve missed the sight of her,
Our hearts may not forget;
We’ve lost the old delight of her,
We keep her honor yet.
We’ll honor yet the school we knew,
The best school of all;
We’ll honor yet the rule we knew
Till the last bell call.
For. working days and holidays,
And glad or melancholy days,
They were great days and jolly days
At the best school of all.
The men that tanned the hide of us,
Our daily foes and friends,
They shall not lose their pride of us
Howe’er the journey ends.
Their voice to us who sing of it
No more its message bears,
But the round world shall sing of it
And all we are be theirs.
We’ll honor yet the school we knew. ...
Not less deservedly celebrated arc E. E.
Bowen’s “Forty Years On,” the school song
of Harrow:—
Forty years on. when afar and asunder
Parted are those who are singing to-day,
When we lodk back and forgetfully wonder
What you were like in your work and your play,
' Then it may be there will often come o’er you
Glimpses of notes like the catch of a song,
Visions of boyhood shall float them before you,
Helloes of dreamland shall bear them along.
Follow up, follow up, till the field ring again anc
again
To the tramp of the thirty-six men! Follow up!
Truly here we have something that wouk
appeal to the heart of the boy and linger ii
the mind of the man.
The other classical example of the sclioo
song is the “Eton Boat Song,” by Willian
Jolmson-Cory. This has more of the spiri
of emulation with other specific schools than
the (Clifton and Harrow songs have, and, b
it freely confessed, suffers in my judgmen
from my not knowing the melody to which
it is sung. The Clifton song has a very
singable melody composed by L. A. Adamsei
of Wesley (Melbourne), and another equal!
good, though less well known, by Frederick
Earp, while John Farmer’s setting of “Forty
Years On” is (to give it high praise indeed;
worthy of the verses themselves.
With these fine specimens before us, per
baps we may be able to detect the desiderata
of the school song.
The verses, it seems, should be direct in
appeal, and the sentiment such as would fine
its way into the heart of the boy. That
would explain the evident preoccupation
with sport. In the greatest lyrics it has been
observed that the thought has been subordiu
ated to the swing; that the lilt is more than
the matter. Thus to the successful schoo
song a chorus would appear to be essentia
and an ethical substratum of purpose
Rhythm and swing are essential: observe the
feminine rhymes used by Bowen and New
bolt. The melody must be within the range
of children’s voices.
I shall conclude by quoting a few verses
from the winning songs in the Scotch Col-
lege competition and a couple of other recent
examples. Here are two verses from “Our
Fathers Planted Here a Tree,” by Alex. C
Welsh, which won the prize in the first
competition and is sung to the melody of “The
Day Thou Gavest.” The writer is palpably
aiming at the Caledonianism of the pro-
moters :
Our fathers planted here a tree;
It flourished ’neath this Austral sky.
From its stout shaft in majesty
It flujng its mighty branches' high.
’Neath its shade sheltered are their sons.
They have gone forth the world to dare,
Gone forth wherever valor runs,
The earth's proud heritage to share.
Our fathers hese an anvil built,
On which to shape a trusty sword,
To weld the blade unto the hilt,
To send it forth at freedom’s word.
For character is through the fire,
The blow, the effort only won;
The force that forged a Scottish sire
Shall nerve a true Australian son.
Here arc a few of the 11 stanzas of the song
that won the second competition. They Were
written by A. J. lv. Knox:—
The olden time comes o’er us,
The well-remembered day
When, ail our life before us,
We swelled the mighty chorus
Of “Come on Scotch! Hooray!”
Of “Come on Scotch! Hooray 1”
The old school fire is burning
Ib boys now turning grey,
Nor all the years returning
Can quench the early yearning
Of “Come on Scotch! Hooray 1”
The cruder ore is fusing
Beneath the ardent ray,
The selfish matter losing
As all in all enthusing
Shout, “Come on Scotch ! Hooray ! ”
The two most recent examples I have seen
are the school songs of the Grafton High
• School and of the Hay War Memorial High
School. A real school song is indeed a
treasure beyond opals; it remains to be seen
whether either of the following will live: —
Where the lordly river Clarence
Rolls in splendor towards the sea,
Where the stately jacaranda
Blooms in regal majesty,
There our school, the pride and glory
Of a smiling verdant land,
In the hearts of all Graftonians
Foremost shall for ever stand.
A lid here is the liay song*, sung to the noble
elsh melody of “Land of Our Fathers” :
they went forth to battle with bright, dauntless eyes;
,i! ie y i home and school and clear Riverine skies,
1 hough they, fell in the race, every man el*e he dies
Has flung us his torch here at Hay.
Hqy! Hay! Off like the wind with it, Hay!
Strain muscle and thew,
'■t hat torch must win through!
We’ll ioin or jail fighting for Ilay!
llie wounds of a friend, and the blows that hit true,
rri I IK " built better for us than we knew,
i „ s that we fought till they dear to us grew—
We 11 remember the fellows at Hay !
Hay, Ilay, oil the joys and the buffets at Hay l
■4* the years onward glide,
Whatever betide.
Vt'e’ll treasure the memories of Hay,
MERCC CIO.
Australia and the Films
A gentleman named Shauer, whose head-
quarters are Hollywood, the place where the
fillums and the scandals come from, and
who styles- himself the general manager of
the foreign section of Paramount Pictures,
has been spending a few minutes in Aus-
tralia. Like all gentlemen who are in the
fillum business, he believes it is a great edu-
cational force; he calls it the greatest. He
has a specific object in coming to Australia.
His firm is going to make a picture here. A
real Australian picture. A picture that will
further America’s ideal of educating the
world through the film. He is going to do
that educating in the way America always
likes to do its educating—through an Ameri-
can.
The great teacher chosen to spread the
gospel of fillum education through the
vehicle of an Australian picture is
°ne Zane Grey, writer of red-blooded
thrillers of the wild west of America.
Zane Grey writes these shockers for the
education of (so his publishers say) the
greatest reading public in the world—numeri-
cally, of course. Temporarily Mr. Grey has
exhausted his stock of bad men and virtue-
soaked women in Amurrica, and is coming
here to write a “real thrilling Australian
story.” The prospect is appalling. Para-
mount is going to "shoot” this story on the
exact location. Mr. Shauer, expanding
this project in Melbourne, said: “You have
magnificent scenery and fine sunlight, and
everything favors a tip-top production in this
land of yours." As an afterthought, appa-
rently viewing the possibility of Australian
films being made by Australians (a remote
possibility, as we seem to be grateful to
Amurrica for the rubbish she sends us in
drama, fiction, film and song), he added
this warning advice: “If Australian films are
produced of a high standard, then the Ameri-
can public will appreciate the opportunity
qf viewing them. But they must be of a
high standard.” Australia, the pupil listen-
ing to Amurrica, the magnanimous men-
tor, should be grateful for the advice, and,
taking American films as a horrible example,
profit by it.
M hat sort of a story are we likely to get
from this perpetual-motion machine of a
twentieth-century fiction-factory, Zane
Grey? "Loaded for bear,” this writer of
lexas melodrama, which makes the worst
Bland Holt stage-shocker blush furiously, is
sweeping on Australia. He carries with him
the whole paraphernalia of his art. The
whole box of tricks is being transferred from
El Paso, Texas, for the purpose of churning
out the “real Australian thriller.” Unfor-
tunately for Mr. Grey s sense of obligation
to the Australian section of his great read-
ing public, we don’t want, the sort of Aus-
tralia Zane Grey, of Arizona, will visualise
and have “shot” for the cinema screen. The
world knows too much about the Australia
that does not exist from people who lived
here as long as Mr. Shauer has and Mr.
Grey will. Speaking at a luncheon in Mel-
bourne the other day. Lord Allenby said he
had read a lot about Australia before he
came here: “ ‘Robbery Under Arms’ and
stories about bushrangers and red-shirted
gold-diggers.” That is the class of stow
that has immortalised Zane Grey, and if he
is coming here to perpetuate the nuisance
we should make up our minds not to give him
ink for his fountain-pen. The Zane Grey story
is not the sort of advertisement that Aus-
tralia wants; it is not the sort of education
we are looking for from the film. America
doesn’t seem to mind him turning her great
West into.a “six-shooter’s” paradise, but we
should refuse to follow her example.
There is another aspect of the question
which might appeal to Australians. A defi-
nite effort (and a successful one) is being
made to establish the film industry in Aus-
tralia. Two pictures which reflect certain
phases of Australian . life have been made
and are being exhibited to appreciative audi-
ences who wish to be entertained and not
educated. They are Marie Bjelke Petersen’s
story of North-West Tasmania. “Jewelled
Nights.” and Mabel Forrest’s story of the
Queensland cattle country, “Moth of Moon-
bi.” Both writers are Australians; both
pictures arc equal to the standard of the
pictures America sends us. Both writers
know the places of which they write, and
know the people. If Mr. Shauer wants to
“shoot” a real Australian picture for the
education and delectation of America and
the world, why doesn’t he give an Australian
the chance to write the story? America might

the children growing up in the city to-day
have had no childhood; the privilege ot
magic hours has been denied them. Is i
fair to blame the war for this ? It is cus-
tomary to blame the war for everything in
these days. We may say that the birth
of grim reality stifled the imagination ot
this generation before it came into the
world, or, at all events, before it could
speak. We may say it, certainly, but do
we really believe it is true? No! I lie war
brought tragedy very near to us, but we were
too young to realise all its horror, aiid the
glamor and excitement of the tales ot heroic
deeds rather gave nourishment to our
imagination than otherwise. For imagination
is there all right; deep down in the heart
of each of us it lies, ready to be awakened.
At birth each one of us is presented with
a pair of magic sandals, to flee the world;
but most of us allow them to tarnish, and
they lose their magical properties through
lack of use. Let us strengthen our wings
of fancy and save the childhood of the race
by killing artificiality, and returning to
nature. . . .
This was meant to be an indignant denial;
it has turned out to be almost a contrite
confession of guilt. Almost, but not quite;
for the injustice of the accusation stiff
rankles. It is not the fault of the little
“heirs apparent” that the magic wand fails
to entice them, or that they prefer a sophis-
ticated party to a ride in a pumpkin coach
drawn by mice, or any of the myriad won-
derful things to be had the other side ot
the curtain. The older generation who
object to their children seeing life through
gilded spectacles must take the larger share
of the blame,
But why end on a despondent note? A
glimpse into any free kindergarten will show
that there is material to work on : children
are waiting to listen open-eyed to fairy-
stories, to forget the sordid realities of their
home environment, to receive the magic
password into that other land, where all
that is required is the soul of a child.
MARQUITA.
“The Tilted Cart”
Mary Gilmore holds a place lonely and
apart among Australian women. Her sing-
ing has, at its best, a strength and an origi-
nal force unlike that of any other woman
writer here or elsewhere; and while she
often defies acknowledged rule and form,
there is generally a musical quality even in
her most irregular lines. At times she has
seen great visions, not very clear in outline
perhaps, but large and full of strange lights
and shadows; at times she has set the
trumpet to her moufli and taken her stand
as the leader of some grand march into new
places; sometimes there is a prophetic in-
tensity about her; most often she lives in
her verse with the simple things of the home,
the street and the farm. A writer of many
rnoods, some of them almost too lofty for
thought, she is often happiest when she
touches the commonplace. Rarely does it
remain commonplace in her hands; for the
gift of fine sympathy can give emotional
values to common household dust and the
chatter over a back-yard fence. In all this
she is intensely Australian, as much so in
her different way as was Henry Lawson
himself.
Her latest publication, The Tilted Cart, is
modestly described as a book of recitations;
and no doubt most of the things it contains
could be effectively recited in the popular
manner where a sympathetic audience was
found. But it is much more than a book of
recitations—to be mouthed and shouted and
played upon with strange tricks of speech.
There is a great deal of poetry in the vol-
ume ; it gets well below the surface of things
and often touches real emotions hidden under
the disguises of every day. It is probably
the manner rather than the matter that has
caused the collection to be described as it is.
The lines are set in simple and often rugged
form and there is little attempt to avoid the
commonplace in phrasing; yet some finer
thing nearly always shows through. Take
an example from “Paddy Mannion’s Song of
the Road”
Me an’ the old road, goin’ along together,
The old road listenin’ —talkin’ through the leather.
Friends ? Why, we are cobbers, the old road an’ me,
Windin’ on, wanderin’ on, like rivers to the sea.
Me an’ the old road! Where every foot of way
Says, “Here you’ll pass to-morrow as you passed
yesterday ! ”
Yesterdays an’ yesterdays, like hills ranged behind,
An’ they’re all stored together in an old man’s
mind.
The swagman has often been sung, but never
before quite from that platform; yet it is
every way as convincing as some of the Law r-
son lamentations on the same subject. Here
are two stanzas from a piece entitled “Re-
tired” that call at once to the heart: —
And once, when I found her stand so,
She said, with the ecorn on her face,
“Them things are nothing but show—
The suite and the curtains of lace!
I’m sick of the chairs and the plush,
I’m sick of the bell on the door ;
I long for the smell of the brush,
I crave for a talk at the store.
“The childer are gone, and I’m lone
For all I have cushions of silk,
Till I’m wishin’, all on my own,
’Twas breakfast —and then to the milk.
Himself, he’s fain for the ground....
He’s off! And I’m wearyin’ sore,
Just for the clattering, homely sound
Of his old bush boots on the floor!”
There are richer verses than these in the
collection, and there are poorer also, but
these are very characteristic. Many of the
pieces carry a tale or the suggestion of a
tale; many deal with homely subjects like
“Second-hand Beds,” “The Saturday Tub,'
“Boots” and “The Tin Pannikin.” All are
full of quiet feeling which in its presentation
seems very honest and very Australian.
D. M. W.
The Passion of the Pom.
The other day I read again Bayard Tay-
lor’s verses, “The Bedouin Love Song,” and
remembered their emasculation for British
consumption. The American poet romanti-
cised the alleged passion of the desert-men,
and his reward has been the vulgarisation of
his love-song until it becomes a “best-seller”
■ —“The Sheik,” written by a despairing and
feminine Nonconformist conscience for in-
tense virgins living in a community whose
females preponderate.
Bayard Taylor did it well —too well for
English hypocrisy in matters sexual; so the
English version of the song set to tinkly
suburban music alters his first verse out of
perspective and deletes the verse most
humanly passionate and clingsome. As wit-
ness :
From the desert I come to thee
On my stallion shod with fire.
And the winds are left behind
In the speed of my desire.
(Oh, good Queen Victoria!)
Under thy window I stand,
And the midnight hears my cry.
I love thee, I love but thee,
With a love that shall not die
Till the sun grows cold
And the stars are old
And the leaves of the judgment book unfold!
And this verse deleted: —
Under thy window I stand
In my passion and my pain,
Under thy window I stand
And I faint in thy disdain.
Oh ! Open the door of thy heart
And open thy chamber door.
(Nay; nay, Albert the Good!)
And my kisses shall teach thy lips
The iove that shall fade no more.
In the second line of that first verse one
may understand how in the late Victorian
era the shadows of Victoria and Albert the
Too Good fell across that word “stallion.”
The English version of the song could not
bear it. Passions must not be roused; but
although the line must be emasculated the
fact must be suppressed. So they would not
say
From the desert I come to thee
On my Suffolk punch (broncho, bony steed, pinto,
brumby, mare, horse, Dachshund, antelope,
moose, cow, quagga, zebra, onagra, donkey,
elephant, foal, Percheron, Clydesdale, Shetland,
Timor or Aurochs) shod with fire
because all the animals had sex. And the
British conscience would not say
From the desert I come to thee
On my gelding' (mule, wether or capon) shod
with fire
because all these are wicked, in that they
suggest the sex that they have lost. So the
Nonconformist conscience makes it: —
From the desert I come to thee
On my Arab shod with fire.
I don't know of any position more poignant
than that of the Arab spurred on to the
wowsers’ love-meeting. I can almost see the
poor Arab perhaps a holy Hadji from
Mecca —champing his bit under his big mous-
tache, his sandals worn to nothing, his bur-
nous stained with sweat and foam, his thighs
gashed by the spurs of the Bedouin from
Clapham Junction. Only a Christian could
so treat a Mohammedan. At the time Britain
was apparently not on good terms with the
Arabs, so the suggestion of a Bedouin riding
on an unemployed Arab could cause no
international complications greater than
those already subsisting.
There is an idea in this by which the songs
of the people should be a First Aid to Patriot-
ism. Alter the nation’s songs to fit the case
of any country with which the dear old
Empire is at war at the moment, and thus
cover that enemy-country with contumely
and ignominy and derision, or words to that
effect. As one war ended and another began,
the contumely could be switched in this
manner:—
From the desert I come to thee
On my Arab (Egyptian, Bulgarian, Czecho-Slova-
kian, German, Russian, French, American or
Indian) shod with fire.
And the business could be carried further
than that. It could be introduced into elec-
tions and municipalities, so that the wowser
baritone might sing :
From the desert I come to thee
On my Protectionist (Socialist, Bolshevik, Com-
munist, Sectarian or Laborite, as the case
might require) shod with fire.
The idea may be extended indefinitely with-
out affecting the little sense that the influence
of Victoria and Albert the Too Good have
left in the adaptation. We in Australia
miss many of the beautifully moral spec-
tacles of the dear old homeland, and none
are fin«r than that of the national moralist
who stands in Fleet-street with his little knife
castrating the little love-songs as they go by.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Satchel of Books
The Magic Castle, by Netta Syrett (Geoffrey Bles).
An ancient castle, a group of children and a strange
youth, habited in doublet and hose, bearing a
curiously wrought key. These are the materials of
a fanciful tale for young people. The illustrations
are the worst part of an indifferent performance.
Scotland’s Heir, by Winifred Duke (Chambers).
The writer has thrown a chapter of history into the
form of a novel without any serious sacrifice of
historical truth, and succeeds in exciting some degree
of sentimental sympathy for the broken prince. “He,
who had lost everything, for a very little time
found his own soui and a nation’s devotion that
was deathless.”
Biography for Beginners (Werner Laurie). A
third edition of the very amusing collection of
jingles and caricatures, or “diagrams,” as the pub-
lisher terms them—and some of them may be that
or anything—put together by the pen of E. C. Bentley
and the pencil of G. K. Chesterton. There is nothing
serious about this production ; it is sheer skylarking,
and conceals its art under the absence of poetry in
the poet and art in the artist —but they' get there.
Tales of the Eskimo, by Henry Toke Munn (Cham-
bers). In 1914 the author had been sent to make
certain mining reports. Having completed his in-
quiries, he returned to the dep6t to await an ex-
pected vessel. No ship appeared, and he had to
spend a second winter in polar land. The present
volume is the outcome in a very' readable if sketchy
account of the Eskimo people, their social life
and customs. Illustrated by numerous photographs.
The Glutton’s Mirror, by William Caine (Fisher
Unwin). By the death of this author in the year just
closed, the British people lost one of their choicest
humorists. Caine delighted in burlesque and extrav-
aganza and carried the high spirits of youth into
the years of maturity. Without being a great
draughtsman, he had a natural gift for line, and
whatever the technical defects of the drawings in
this humorous book, they will appeal to all who
can find a laugh for clever nonsense.
Surgery 100 Years Ago (Geoffrey Bles). A trans-
lation from the Dutch of extracts 'from the letters and
diaries of three young surgeons who in the early days
of the nineteenth century made a tour through
Europe to acquaint themselves with up-to-date
practice. How in those days of operations without
anaesthetics men had the fortitude to face the knife
we find, in these soft times, difficult to realise.
And when the trial had been undergone the odds
were all against the patient, since sepsis generally
claimed him.
Across Unknown Australia, by Michael Terry
(Herbert Jenkins). Two young men set out on a
transcontinental trip through Queensland and the
Northern Territory. They had for capital a motor-
car, youth, a limited stock of experience and a
great deal of assurance. How they crossed in more
or less of a beeline the country lying between Winton
(Q.) and Broome (W.A.) is the subject matter of
this narrative. It is a book for “Home” consumption,
of course; to call the country they traversed “un-
known Australia” would be altogether too ridiculous
in Australia itself.
Maori Folk-songs, by Hine-titama. The Maori, liis
traditions and mythology and his romantically
beautiful country offer a wealth of material to the
maker of fiction and verse, but the field remains
unploughed. Alfred Domett showed what might be
done with it 60 .years ago, but very few have even
attempted to follow in that literary politician’s
footsteps. This slender volume of “Maori Folk-songs”
by an Auckland lady suffers from the twofold dis-
ability that the verses are sadly uninspired and that
a glossary is essential to explain them to any reader
unversed in Maori lore. The little book serves,
however, as a reminder that a rich storehouse awaits
the hand that shall turn the key and exploit its
treasures.
Contemporary British Philosophy, edited by J. H.
Muirhead. Second series (Allen and Unwin). In
this volume the editor brings together the personal
statements of representatives of the leading pniio-
sophical theories current at the present time, carry-
ing on the general scheme set out in the preceai g
series. The reader obtains at first-hand the views
of men eminent in the domain of speculative
thought. Professor Muirhead expresses the opinion
that the broad conclusion to be drawn is one not ot
despair of progress, but of extreme hopefulness that,
as a result of an exploration of the frontier provinces
of human experience, some authentic tidings may he
ultimately brought to us of what lies beyond.
Reminiscences, by Marie Princess of Battenberg
(Allen and Unwin). “Often while I was writing
these reminiscences I asked myself: Whs'? ana
Wherefore?” The reader will echo the inquiry. Out
of all the straw in this voluminous book of small
talk some grains of wheat might have been winnowed
by a judicious editor to make a pamphlet. As it is,
modern readers, wdio have no time to spare on a
princelet who “sneezed three times, yawned, and
fell asleep again,” will take it with impatience.
One of the grains is an account of an evening in
1908 spent in Potsdam with the Kaiser whilst the
Kaiserin crocheted a coverlet. “He spoke much ot
England, drawing comparisons between Queen Victoria
and King Edward, not at all to the advantage of the
latter, who, he said, allowed himself to be ruled by
Americans and the English of the underworld. In
short, he show T ed a very bad disposition towards
England.”
The Wind (Harper). The author has not seen
fit to attach his, or probably her, name to this
powerful novel. It is a study of the play of ele-
mental forces on human character. Letty Mason,
whose childhood and early years had been spent
in the State of Virginia, rich in natural beauty and
endowed with the associations of centuries of tran-
quil domestic and social life, is through family
misfortunes transplanted to pioneer Texas, the Texas
of years ago, where “for endless miles there seemed
nothing but wind and sand and empty, far-off sky.
There she marries, for protection and companionship,
a rugged but sterling pioneer and easts her lot into
the conquest of the land. How in the long run the
wind and the shifting sand break her down till
she “fled across the prairies like a leaf blown in a
gale, borne along in the force of the wind that was
at last to have its way with her,” is told in
a very human and moving story.
Mr. Shaw and the Maid, by J. M. Robertson (R.
Cobden-Sanderson). There is a current legend,
according to this author, who is one of the most
scholarly of the modern school of Shakspearean critics,
that G.B.S. wrote his “Saint Joan” to save her
from John Drinkwater, echo has a turn for making
history fit his theories. Robertson now appears on
the scene to “save history from Mr. Shaw.” He
complains that in “Saint Joan” Shaw has transmuted
the maid of history, that “noble figure of the tranced
visionary, with her sheer, burning, mediaeval faith
in God and the saints, inspiring disheartened soldiers
and populace to a kindred faith in her mission,” into
“a kind of early Feminist Reformer —a superwoman
with a genius for artillery and tactics, reforming
a demoralised army.” Under the Shavian process
“we have lost a real historic figure and gained
a mere whimsical contraption” ; indeed, according
to Mr. Robertson, “in compounding his vivacious
mannequin he has put the whole historic process
out of action.” His, then, the task of setting the
erratic dramatist right in his historical presentment.
In order to do this so many foundation-stones in its
structure have to be removed that after the l abor
has been accomplished only a wreck is left. But
perhaps, after all, many a saint may have been a
frequent sinner; we are at any rate certain that
many men of modern times, renowned for great
and saintly deeds, had tremendous and not always
successful struggles with the Evil One. So to many
the real interest in the play is not the actual per-
sonality of the Maid of Orleans so much as what
sort of creature under her name has been evolved
out of the brain of G.B.S.


What makes the big difference?
Those who know say “SUPERTWIST"
This past year the tyre-users of
Australia have seen demonstrated
once more the traditional superior-
ity of Goodyear manufacture.
They have seen the balloon tyre,
under the touch of Goodyear
experience and skill, brought from
uncertainty and doubt into estab-
lished national usage.
They have seen the Goodyear-
made balloon tyre tried and not
found wanting under the most
varied and severe service to which
a tyre is subject,
Whether on primitive country trail
or the city’s level asphalt, they
have seen it deliver every wanted
property of durability and comfort.
It is true, of course, that Good-
year s incomparable background
of more than 75,000,000 tyres
supplied to the public has much to
do with this performance.
It is true, too, that Goodyear
fidelity to tested design and to
quality material has contributed
mightily to this new tyre’s un-
alloyed success.
But even more directly, it must be
confessed, is the superb behavior
of Goodyear balloons traceable to
yet another cause.
That cause is SUPERTWIST, the
now celebrated cord fabric,
developed and perfected by Good-
year to solve the special needs of
the low-pressure tyre.
The fundamental advantage of
SUPERTWIST is its greater elas-
ticity; it far outstretches the break-
ing point of standard cord fabric.
When the Goodyear Tyre made of
it strikes a stone or obstruction, the
SUPERTWIST cords give to and
yield under the blow, stretching
and recovering, like rubber bands.
Their function is not alone to resist
the shock of impact, but to absorb
it and thus to distribute the strain
over a greater portion of the tyre.
This ability to stretch minimises
any chance of cord breakage, and
affords special protection against
stone bruise and similar injuries.
You want the big difference that
is in Goodyear Tyres, a difference
which makes “more people, the
world over, ride on Goodyear
Tyres than on any other kind.”
Through SUPERTWIST you can
now get it in greater measure than
ever.

Dealer about Goodyear Balloons

PACKARD STRAIGHT-EIGHT SEVEN-PASSENG ER SEDAN
PACKARD DISTINCTION
IN the Packard Single-Six and Straight-Eight Sedans are combined all
the elements of luxurious motoring. There is an indefinable air of dis-
tinction in its appearance and a reassuring feeling of the reliability in the
performance of the Packard which instantly appeal.
Among the many contributing feat-
ures in the luxury of Packard motor-
ing may be mentioned the long wheel
base, under-slung front springs, low-
pressure tyres, luxurious upholstery,
exceptionally wide and roomy seats,
and the noiseless, smoothly running
engine. While the comfort of Packard
motoring has been made so complete,
attention has also been given to im-
provements in the ordinary routine
care of the car. The"one-shot”lubri-
cating system is a built-in feature of
all Packard cars and each engine is
fitted with a motor oil rectifier which
prevents dilution of the motor oil and
retains its naturally viscous condition.
These two improvements together
double the life of the Packard and
minimise the routine care.

“Why, she looks as young and charming as her daughter.” How
often have you heard these words spoken about women who have retained
their girlish appearance while their family is quickly growing up around
them! Have you ever stopped to think what the real secret of their
youth is? The turning-point of youth to early middle-age comes when a
little silvery grey creeps in amongst that crowning glory of women —their
hair. No matter the youthful bloom upon the cheek, or the figure its easy
girlish form, the hair appearance is the mirror of the age.
Stop for a moment and think of the really smart women that you
know; they do not allow those tell-tale grey hairs, the unmistakable symbol
of advancing years, to creep in and spoil their beauty. _ •
Grey hair can never be fashionable —it is the first sign of old age. A
man may be as old as he feels—but a woman is as old as her hair.
Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain has enjoyed the confidence of women
for 25 years-—it is perfectly harmless, easy to apply, immediate in action,
and, above all, undetectable. Carefully carry out the instructions and let
it restore your hair to its natural shade. Grey hairs will vanish like magic
and youth will walk in at your door.

Young Wonder.
The maid was such a little maid,
So much of wonder filled her eye,
It seemed that pleased, but half afraid,
She watched a mammoth world go by.
She watched a mammoth world go by
Where everything to her was new ;
Each magic changing of the sky
A gasping wonder from her drew.
A gasping wonder from her drew
Each little flower hid in the grass;
In each bright insect as it flew
She saw a world of magic pass.
She saw a world of magic pass;
A wondrous choir began to sing,
With every bird that from the grass
Rose trilling on its soaring wing.
Rose trilling on its soaring wing
Her happy spirit, to explore
A world of wonders; everything
She showed my clouded eyes once more.
She showed my clouded eyes once more
Much beauty they had ceased to see;
She filled the bushland and the shore
With magic new again for me.
With magic new again for me
She spelled me through a golden day;
And when I parted from her glee,
Regret went with me on my way.
Regret went with me on my way;

Message.
My love is gone out through the night
Like the call of a bird
Or a far-away melody heard!
It has passed, fading fast from the sight,
Like the wings of a swallow in flight,
Autumn stirred.
The echo returns from the hill
And the swallow with spring.
Like the note of a quivering string
Through the silence, a message will thrill
The darkness rose-scented and still,
Answering.

ETHEL MARTYR.
The Honey Pool.
“A honey pool will come into force.”
Does it lie in a nest of rusty fern
With the young owls leaning to look therein?
Do the yellow spiders across it spin?
Do the sun rays bathe in it till they burn
The ripples of gold that are syrup-sweet?
Does it make a snare for the beetles’ feet?
It has made the white-frilled daisies wonder,
And a stately iris beside the rim
Has swung towards it. There, blurred and
dim,
fts purple image the pool must ponder,
Half-angered, deep in its sunlit fold,
That the sombre petals dare dull such gold !
Where the fairy lances of tall reeds meet
With their green flags lisping of scented
things
Does the herald bee come with hurrying
wings?
Brave news like this must be carried fleet—
“O comrades mine, by the grey toadstool,
I saw myself in a honey pool!”
A big black butterfly, softly winging,
Poised there and sipped as it fluttered
through;
And a lark dropped down from the arch of
blue.
For his willing throat had grown hoarse with
singing.
He filled his beak where the pool lay bright,
And his voice went on in a trail of light.
The rainbow ribboned above its gleaming;
And, as a mirror of copper shows
A queen’s flushed cheek, it was painted rose
By the agile dawn through the mauve mists
scheming.
And ere the sun on the hills might rest
He had flung gold arrows its depth to test!
By the small gilt horns of the new moon
ambered
The feathery night-moths came there to feed
And to certain death in their scrambling
greed,
A fated army, the black-ants clambered.
And many a lovely foolish thing
Was dragged to death by a honeyed wing.
Then there came a grocer who walked that
way,
And he crushed the fern witli his placid feet.
He found the tarn that was golden-sweet
When the air was tender as new-mown hay,
And he drained that pool—for it seemed no
sin—
And he packed it all into squares of tin.
You can buy it now in the nearest shop.
There’s a State-fixed charge, so you won’t
pay over
The standard price if it taste of clover,
Or you find a rainbow in every drop;
For no man can rate such magic things
As iridescence on wild moths’ wings.
The song of the lark or an iris petal.
The green delights of a bettle’s back,
Unscheduled compounds he came to pack
In a labelled tin of the homeliest metal.
Just take your honey. You don’t suppos -
That the serious soul of the grocer know
QUEENSLAND.

FREEING THE UNIONIST FROM HIS
CHAINS.
The Crimes Bill looks much more like the
new Attorney-General than the old one-—the.
old, colorless, long-distance legal Minister
who seemed as if he would never quit, but
tore himself away at last, and promptly
recurred as Speaker. Some of its provisions
may possibly be ruled out by five different
High Court Judges, actuated by five different
and contradictory motives, but it gives a
general impression that it will stand fairly
firm. A good beginning is made by defining
“unlawful associations,” which are bodies
that teach, advocate and encourage the over-
throw of our Constitution, or of any other
civilised Constitution, or of Constitutions in
a general and unspecified way, by “revolution
or sabotage.”. That provides against the
organisation of a force here which might be
professedly intended for the forcible refor-
mation of Southern Ireland or Peru. The
prohibition extends to branches and com-
mittees, and to schools and institutions appa-
rently run by unlawful associations, and it
makes it an offence to be a teacher in any
such school, or to be an office-holder in any
such prohibited body, or to be a member
(aged over 18) thereof. Also the bill lays
for people who contribute to the gory Bol-
shevist show, or collect for it, and it forfeits
tjje show’s goods, chattels and literature, and
prohibits the publication of its appeals. As
a side-issue, it is proposed that “disturbed
districts” may be proclaimed, and that vyhile
a place continues disturbed and proclaimed
the doing of anything in the way of a strike
oi* lockout “in connection with the, transport
of goods or the conveyance of passengers ' is
to be an offence, likewise the holding-up of
the public service in any way. The maxi-
mum penalties seem almost absurdly 7 small
in most instances so far as the local gaol is
concerned, but in addition the non-Australian
offender may be (the bill, unfortunately,
doesn’t say he shall be) sent back to his
native land, and he may be imprisoned again
and then re-deported if he returns. This
re-deportation can be ordered by the Attor-
ney-General, without further legal formality
before five High Court Judges or otherwise.
One way and another, it is a measure with
possibilities, assuming that the Common-
wealth has its own police in sufficient num-
bers, and its own law courts (for a minor
judiciary which holds office at the discretion
of a State Government is liable to take its
orders from the same source as its salary),
and its own gaols and a capable Attorney-
General, and provided the Constitution
doesn’t leak in too many fresh places.
*****
Wild and incoherent protests were, of
c.ourse, inevitable, and the most criminal
elements of the community are the most
shocked. One really impassioned utterance
was to the effect that the proud and inde-
pendent and war-breathing Australian won’t
endure tyranny of this sort. Large and
vague and dreadful things are to happen, and
if they do happen Charlton and Garden
and Walsh and Johanson all solemnly
wash their hands, like Pilate the Dago in
days of old. If the Australian does feel as
hostile and injured as that, he can, of course,
annul the whole business at next Federal
election, and it is so near that the interval is
hardly worth getting up a perspiration about.
Then he can recall Garden and Walsh and
Johanson from their exile if they don’t
happen to be in gaol in their ow r n countries,
find if he wants them back, and he can com-
pensate them for their sufferings out of the
public revenue. It would be worth while to
be deported for such a spectacular return.
Meanwhile there would be nothing to prevent
the trade-unions supporting the exiles while
they w T ere away. Cause for alarm might exist
if the Bruce-Page Ministry showed any inten-
tion of gerrymandering the Lower House
electorates, or fakihe the rolls, or laying in
a dishonest ballot-box for use at next elec-
tions, or putting nominees in the elective
Chambers, or abolishing the Senate and the
Federal and State Constitutions, or other-
wise preventing the popular revolt. But as
it makes no provision for digging itself in,
the course for Charlton and his kind to
follow is to let it fill the tub of its alleged
iniquity to the brim, and then fall over the
receptacle and break its neck, and finally
cut its throat and hang itself. Strangely
enough, however, what the revolutionists
most threaten is that the Ministerial doings
will drive the nation to violence and pre-
cipitate the revolution which Walsh and
Johanson and Garden say they foresee,
and thus make their triumph complete. The
way they hate their triumph to be complete
is phenomenal.
* * * #
It is made an especial ghost or bogey that
the Crimes Bill is “an attack on unionism.”
If trade-unionism really consists in incessant
temporary stoppages of trade and wages, and
the wild schemings of ex-firemen and ex-
parsons to make the stoppage permanent,
some such attempt may be intended. If it
is, and if the majority of the community
doesn’t like it, that majority will doubtless
make its views clear at next general
election. It may also give an inkling of them
at by-elections, a thing which it isn’t allowed
to do in N. S. Wales State affairs while
Labor rules. In the meantime a Govern-
ment with 1697 soldiers under arms and
scattered over a continent and some islands
(these constitute the “militarism” against
which such hysterical protest is made), and
with about two dozen police, isn’t likely to
play the part of the raging tyrant unless a
very solid mass of public opinion is behind it.
The five State Labor Governments have
about 5500 pplice of their own with whom
to uphold the' cause of Freedom if the worst
comes to the worst. When the Bruce-Page
Cabinet attacks the revolutionary variety of
unionism (or the revolutionary excrescence
which has hitched itself on to unionism) it
probably has 80 per cent, of union members
on its side. It would be unsafe for them
to say so until some force is in existence to
protect them against the vicious little tyrants
who have usurped control of the entire show,
but they probably will say so when freedom
of speech and action become possible again.
To many there is a strictly limited satisfac-
tion in squalid scraps about nothing, engin-
eered by men who allege that their ultimate
purpose is to dig up the pot of gold which
is at the end of the Russian rainbow and
enrich everybody with the contents, but there
are cases in which the worker has to be
squalid or pass out, and when he has to
scrap or be industrially excommunicated.
Theoretically, unionism is a sort of republic.
Practically the control has passed to wire-
pullers, subterranean engineers, “white-ant”
experts, uncouth crooks and agile vote-
counters, and the rank-and-file unionist has
about as much say in the management as
the pious colored padre in a village, on the
upper Amazon has in the choice of a new
Pope. The object Rimed at by the Bruce-
Page Government is to relieve the trade-
unionist of bis chains. If he wants to buy a
new Jot of chains in 1929 the Crimes Bill
puts no obstacle in the way.
ITALY DECLARES FOR HONESTY.
The Great War cost Italy 650,000 lives and
about £2,000.000.000, of which £583,000,000
is owed to Britain and £430.000,000 to the
U.S.A. Being now in a position, thanks to
Mussolini and his Black-shirts, to give its
two leading creditors something on account,
the new empire has negotiated funding
agreements with both countries, _ and lias
been granted liberal —in the British case
very liberal —terms. To with J.
Bull’s arrangement with the U.S.A., the
payments to Britain are to be spread over
62 years. Italy is to find £2,000,000 in
1925-26, £4,000,000 in each of the next two
years, £4,250,000 in each of the next four
years, and after that £4,500,000 p.a., with
a final payment of £2,250,000 in 1987-88. If
these instalments are forthcoming, and if
France observes the Caillaux-Churchill
arrangement and Germany fulfils its obliga-
tions under the Dawks plan, Britain will be
£8,000,000 or £9,000,000 short of its annual
tribute (£35,000,000) to its exacting relative
across the Atlantic. The shortage may be
reduced by contributions from Roumania,
which owes the Old Man £28.500,000, and
Yugo-Slavia (£32,000,000), but Portugal
(£23,000,000) is a doubtful proposition, and
so is Greece (£25,000.000). Russia, the
sturdiest beggar of all —it owes J. Bull
£756,704,000—i5, of course, hopeless.
* . «• * *
There are shrill complaints from Paris
that the Baldwin Government has dealt
more generously with Italy than it did with
France when Caillaux and Churchill
were bargaining last year. A grievance is
now made of the then French Finance
Minister’s undertaking that hjs country’s
debt to Britain (£620,000,000) would be
paid, with interest, in 62 annual instalments
of £12,500,000, although Caillaux was
lauded to the skies on his own side of the
Channel when the arrangement waa pub-
lished. An obvious reply to Paris is that
France is a much wealthier country than
Italy. Figures published by the Bankers’
Trust Co., of New York and Paris, show r
that France’s war expenditure, calculated
in U.S. dollars at pre-war rates of exchange,
was 280.20 dollars per head, equivalent to
19.36 p.c. of the national wealth, whereas
Italy’s war expenditure was 124.59 dollars
per head, equivalent to 20.59 p.c. of the
national wealth. Certainly Italy gained
4000 square miles of Tyrolese mountains and
1000 square miles of Adriatic seaboard as
a result of the war. But France, ror its
part, acquired 5605 square miles, with
1,700,000 industrious people, in Alsace-
Lorraiue; and one square mile in Alsace-
Lorraine, which has rich iron and coal mines
an 1 a great extent of fertile country in which
wine, tobacco, cotton and hops are produced,
is worth 20 in the Trentino. Again, France
has prosperous colonies which contribute
substantially to the French exchequer, where-
as Italy’s colonial possessions are poor old
things; and France, on June 30, 1925, had
received 325.506,390 gold marks in repara-
tions payments, while Italy’s share (Italy
was likewise invaded and had fair provinces
devastated) was 51,739,283 gold marks. It
is also recalled that, after arranging to pay
Britain £12.500,000 p.a. for 62 years, Cail-
laux offered the U.S.A. £8,000,000 p.a. for
five years, £12.000,000 p.a. for seven years,
and £20,000,000 p.a. for 50 years. France,
in these circumstances, has nothing to com-
plain of.
* * « *
The Italian settlement is obnoxious to
some very dubious friends of France, as .well
as to the French. Howls of protest have
come from the Daily Chronicle office,
where LlOyd George hangs out, from the
Eacifist Philip Snowden and the Labor
>aily Herald. “Once more have British
Ministers been taken in by a foreign sob-
story,” sneers the Daily Herald. Had Italy
gone Bolsh, as it very nearly did in the
hectic days when the Herald was holding
out its hands for Russian money, Britain
would have had to whistle for its
£583,000,000. It can well afford to make
financial concessions to the Italian regime
which honors the debts that a Bolshevist
regime would have repudiated. It shows
profound political wisdom in cultivating
friendly relations with and encouraging in
honest courses a country which is obviously
destined to play an increasingly imoortant
part in world affairs. Mussolini’s finan-
cial achievement is certainly memorable. In
1920-21 the revenue of distracted Italy was
21,344.000,000 lire and the expenditure
31 024.291.000 lire. In 1921-22 expenditure
exceeded revenue by 12,668,678,000 lire.
Last year the Italian Budget showed a sur-
plus—the first for ages—of 1,052,314,000
lire, and all accounts agree that the country
is prospering as it never did under the rule
of the shady politicians who battened on it
before Mussolini came. Stanley Baldwin
has said that Mussolini methods of gov-
ernment would not be tolerated in any Eng-
lish-speaking country. Mussolini might
retort that no English-speaking country has
ever been reduced to the desperate condition
in which he found Italy in 1922 —not sjnce
Cromwell’s day, at any rate, and Benito
has not killed his king. The Mussolini sys-
tem evidently suits the Italians, who, after
ell, are the best judges of what is good for
them. And. much as its author has been
abused, he has made no attempt to impose
it on foreign countries or extend it by sub-
sidising traitors to stir up civil war, after
the abominable Moscow fashion. Australia,
for its part, should be glad to see the Italians
resolutely choosing the path orhonest finance.
Italy is one of our very good customers,
and when, after the coming into force of the
U.S. quota law, Italian immigration to these
parts showed signs of becoming excessive,
the Mussolini Government proved strong
enough at home and sufficiently considerate
of Australian opinion to apply the brake.
CINDERELLA'S TROUSSEAU.
At the Exhibition Building, Melbourne, the
A.N.A. is staging a new rendering of “Cin-
derella.'’ All students of the industrial de-
velopment of this country are familiar with
the story: how the maiden, largely because
she was so young and so beautiful, was left
at home to chop the wrnod, draw the water
and scrub the floors of the family mansion,
while her elder sisters went to the royal ball
and banquet; how, believing that she de-
served this treatment because of her youth
and beauty, but unable to suppress the desire
to jazz under the balloons and colored lights
with the rest of the manufacturing world,
she sat brooding in the ashes of the fireplace
until a fairy godmother called the Tariff
came along and turned the melons of her
primary industries into motor-bodies and her
white mice into skilled artisans.
The rest of the story isn’t finished, Cix-
DEREIXA not yet having married the prince
owing to remissness in the search for the
foot that fits the mislaid slipper. Neverthe-
less, so many of the fairy godmother’s trans-
formations are housed in the Exhibition
Building that perhaps the politicians will be
moved to hasten the quest.
One of the first displays to impress itself
is the show of Australian timbers, once con-
sidered eminently suitable for boiling billies
and now being put to almost all the uses of
imported timbers. Yellow stringy-bark is
used in divers ways to supplement his metal
work by the indefatigable Sunshine McKay,
who sells his agricultural machinery even to
Siberians. A furniture firm displays en-
chanting things made from the native myrtle,
huloke, mountain-ash and blackwood. It
pays its workmen from £4 17s. fid. a week,
and surrounds them with the decent environ-
ment of a hygienic factory. It is in competi-
tion with Sino-Australian capitalists sweat-
ing the hides off yellow brothers who work
from six in the morning till nine at night and
then sleep on the insanitary premises. And
the representative of the Caucasian firm tells
you confidently that his people can successfully
compete. The secret is machinery; for while
the Mongolian wmrker puts his trust in his
two hands the Australian workman takes
naturally to complicated substitutes of steel.
Here is the exhibit of the Austral Bronze
Co., of Sydney. It has just come back from
Wembley. The concern is the only one of
its kind in Australia, and if it closed down
Australia would have to go to Germany and
England for its supplies of many things
vital to civilised existence. As it uses the
superior but expensive electrolytic copper of
Port Kembla (N.S.W.) in competition with
foreign manufacturers, who use standard
copper, the tariff of 25 p.c. it nominally
enjoys is reduced to an ineffective 13 p.c.
The industry paid a small dividend in 1925
for the first time for many years. As its
plant can be turned at a moment’s notice to
the production of munitions, the Defence
Department is alleged to take an academic
interest in it which might usefully be turned
into a practical participation in the forth-
coming endeavors to obtain a higher tariff.
The Australian can use machinery, and
he can make it, too. Here are Parkinson
motors of lOOh.p. An English model, but,
according to the verdict of the English Par-
kinson’s own designer, a higher product than
the parent firm’s. Next is a booth whose
wares are positively enchanting. They are
examples of the modern passion for making
things look anything but what they are. This
firm takes the scraps and leavings of one of
Australia’s greatest primary industries, and
turns them to the job of framing luxury. The
scraps are bullocks’ hides, the product is
leather goods of every beautiful tone and
all sorts of exotic markings, and the camera
is the medium. Large electrotypes are made
from photographs, and what you get is a per-
fect forgery of the casing of a crocodile or
a walrus. Passing some Australian gramo-
phones extracting American airs from Aus-
tralian records, one comes to the “Pelaco’
exhibit where half a dozen girls selected for
their beauty are stitching shirts. In the
firm’s factory, they say, a Song of the Shirt
is often heard. When one works a 44-hour
week, with holidays on Saturday and Sunday,
and earns from £4 to £8 at piece-work, it is
difficult to refrain from singing something.
Near here is a strange phenomenon a
firm that has never known a strike. It ex
pects some soon, however, when the. old chap
who has kept the union happy and at work
retires on his laurels and is succeeded by his
militant young understudy with a craving for
the limelight and a firm conviction that Ins
spiritual home is Moscow,
Macßobertson’s show is so gorgeous as
to suggest a jeweller's, rather than the raw
material of a lolly-shop. Not far from it is
a resurrection of what was probably Aus
tralia’s first industry—flowers made from
shells. The B.H.P. products add weight and
impressiveness to the show, and Davis, who
turns calves’ feet into fetching jellies, an-
nounces that he has the largest gelatine
works in the Empire, and feels good about
it. Anzac tweeds, hand-woven by Diggers,
grin across at the Prestige hose displayed
on the legs of a living model; and behind
them are illustrated some of the million
things that can be done with the übiquitous
kcro.-tin, which in this country occupies the
place in the people’s polity taken by the
bamboo in Papua.
But the most alluring end of the show is
where the inventors rush out to buttonno c
you and insist on .exhibiting with gleaming
eyes the working of the darlings of their
minds. Such is the youth who has discover
that the ugly tin or expensive aluminium
flashing of the kitchen sink can be better
served by rubber chastely marked; and -
elderly man who is so happy because Laay
Stradbroke, who probably never bent c
a washtub in her life, has been induced
manipulate bis patent washer which won
break the backs of “maidless mothers. Then
the steady shrinkage in size of the sub« ir
allotment has turned one man to devising a
means of replacing the clothes-line, whi
costs ninepence but requires a back. yar-
t.o swing it in, with a complete

PLAIN ENGLISH.
6,000,000.
In the present cannibalistic stage of human
development any country that is not in a
position to defend itself or find a friend
to do the job is liable to become —inevitably
does become —the cockpit of other powers.
Persia, India, Siam, China and Bolivia are
a few countries which have invited the
attention of powerful neighbors. When one
of the predatory Powers is so favorably
placed that it need fear no competition from
other bandits in the same line of business
(such as Japan in Korea), or when it gets
in early (as Britain in India), the weaker
country becomes a colony. If several high-
waymen arrive simultaneously, various
forms of unpleasantness develop. Sometimes
the robbers fight amongst themselves for the
sole possession of the booty, as the Spanish,
Dutch, Portuguese and English in the East
Indies; sometimes they come to an agree-
ment to divide the loot. The country’s
finances are then put under the control of
a consortium of all the Powers. The consor-
tium lends money to it, decides the rate of
interest and earmarks the Customs or the
salt-tax as security. The country is further-
more cut up into Spheres of Influence, and
a single Power claims the right to mine coal,
build railways and sell safety-razors in each
division. Although the bandits seem to be
in perfect accord, frequent after-dinner
speeches testifying to the fact, beneath the
surface boils an enchanting cauldron of in-
trigue. The weak country, having no interest
either way in the outcome of the scramble,
does its utmost to make the division of the
loot as uncomfortable for the looters as
possible. It sets one against the other, sells
its support to the highest bidder, and prays
daily for the glad time when all the brigands
will be at each other’s throats. This happy
consummation has been achieved on numer-
ous occasions, notably when the Portuguese
at Goa fought the English for the right to
trade with the Great Mogul, when the Eng-
lish fought the Spaniards for the privilege
of dying of fever in Manila, and when Japan
went to war with Germany for the right to
work a Chinese mine in Shantung. There
have been, in fact, few decades in the secret
history of colonial diplomacy when some
European Power has not run its finger along
its knife-blade and looked with interest at
the jugular of a white neighbor. But if the
large and crowded country is a temptation to
the burglarious Powers, the weak and empty
one is even more so. In fact, if the imperial-
istic countries have learnt anything of late
years it is that the attempt to govern large
masses of alien people in these days is
doomed to failure. Britain’s position in
India, where white officials are being steadily
Voted out of the local government; America’s
impotence in the Philippines, where an en-
deavor to render land available to American
citizens for rubber-planting was rejected by
the Filipino Parliament such instances
show the disadvantages attending colonial
administration in this year two of the new
Messiah, Woodrow Wilson. In future the
colonising Powers will tend to invade well-
populated countries with trade circulars in-
stead of landing-parties. In fact, there is a
certain safety in mere numbers so long as
they are large enough to effectively occupy
a country. It is far otherwise with the
country that is fertile but empty. The first
invasion of Australia was attended with no
complications. Although Captain Cook
mounted a ceremonial sword he might just
as well have landed with an unbrella.
The next invader could land to-day almost
anywhere on the coastline with an equal lack
of precaution. He could wander inland and
starve to death before he would find an army
to attack or a crowd of people to enslave.
For this reason the public rejoicings over
the circumstance that the population of Aus-
tralia has reached 6,000,000 should be sub-
dued and accompanied with muted cymbals.
The total, anyhow, is not conspicuously
large, seeing that Austro-Hungary before
the war raised an equal number in 12 years,
Japan in eight, Russia in three and China in
18 months, and that London and Greater
New York have a larger total. Nor is the
round figure that has so hypnotised the
leader-writers as important as it seems, con-
sidering that all but a few thousands of it
are concentrated in the South, and there
mainly crammed into two big cities un-
pleasantly near the seaboard. Even in the
most crowded State there are fewer than
20 to the square mile, and, taking the
country as a whole, each of the 6,000,000
can spread himself over nearly one square
mile without treading on his neighbor’s rab-
bit-snares. The State of Westralia is con-
sidered fairly empty. It has about three
persons to the mile. But in the Northern
lerntory there are nearly 150 miles to every
person.

Long Vacation.
This month the Judges of the Supreme Court
W j f, e *- nrn to their legal duties at the
end of the long vacation. They will have
eD J?y ef ' a holiday the mere suggestion of
which would set a schoolboy’s mouth water
mg. True, there has not been a complete
suspension of business, for one or other “Mr.
Justice” has been on duty to attend to more
or .| formal matters which may be dealt
with by one Judge; but the Supreme Court
as such has had its shutters up for more
than a month past. No doubt the work of a
Supreme Court Judge is onerous and exact-
ing, mid does not always end with the closing
ot the day’s sitting. A Judge cannot, as a
rule, during term, spend his extra-court hours
on the golf links or at the bridge table.
His study-lamp burns late many a night.
Granted all this, is his work more respon-
sible, more pregnant with issues of life and
death, than that of a surgeon? Yet the man
with the knife and other fearsome instru-
ments cuts and comes again from January
1 to December 31. He takes a vacation only
when nerve and mind compel it, and the
wlude craft does not have its walk-about simul-
taneously. The truth of the matter is that
law more than any other profession is jeal-
ously conservative of tradition. When Jef-
freys went his blood-stained circuit, there
was a long vacation for him and a grateful
respite for the hangman; and further back,
when the learned Bacon muttered wisdom
and, so ill-report suggests, took tainted
shekels, he doubtless had also a long vaca-
tion. The fact that the world has completely
changed since those days has never pene-
trated the austere veil that shrouds the law.
Like the unwigged barrister whom the law
cannot see, so the outer existence of a new
business world is beyond its view. True, it
may occasionally take judicial notice of the
fact that the world has new interests, new
businesses, new commercial enterprises and
even new inventions, but it goes on un-
moved. The long vacation is static; the out-
side world cannot move it. Is it not time
somebody woke the law? It has a business
side, surely; and, if so, ought not its busi-
ness to be conducted on principles somewhat
akin to those of the rest of the world? And
assuming law has such a side, what other
business in the world is there that could shut
up for a month or two at a time? A plain-
tiff non-suited in December may toss on his
bed of anxiety racked by financial pangs
until somewhere in the middle of February
he can, with luck on the list, have his appeal
heard by the Court. It is not business, and
it is not fair. Roughly the judicial holidays
may be taken as eight weeks’ long vacation,
three weeks’ short vacation, and at least a
week of odd holidays—call it 12 blank weeks
in the year. The great cities of the
Commonwealth have become such hives that
they require the trial of civil matters to go
on continuously. To bring that about may
be difficult, may require .the curtailment or
readjustment of long and short vacations, but
it is not impossible.

Inflated Wage-rates in Sheltered
Industries.
Labor-controlled municipal councils are
proverbially generous with other people’s
money. The new Greater Brisbane Council
has taken over a deficit of £78,894 from the
defunct Brisbane Council, and one of
£11,543 from the South Brisbane affair, both
Labor-controlled. In the last nine months of
its existence the Brisbane tribulation spent
£22,291 more than its receipts. A legacy of
this extravagance, in the form of an indus-
trial agreement, came up for argument re-
cently before the Board of Trade and Arbitra-
tion. The Brisbane Council had been paying
its employees ss. a week above the Local
Authorities award rates, and had granted
them leave concessions at a weekly cost of
7s. a man, making a total of 12s. a week
above award rates; South Brisbane had been
paying its men 10s. a week above award
rates. The Greater Brisbane Council
appealed to the Board of Trade to rescind
the first-mentioned agreement on the grounds
that (1) the benefits it conferred were ex-
cessive; (2) the agreement was made when
one of the parties was on its deathbed; and
(3) it would cause discontent and industrial
unrest among the council’s employees not
entitled to its benefits. The new council
showed admirable optimism in appealing to
a board on which an ex-Labor Premier and
an ex-State secretary of the A.W.U. sit with
a Supreme Court Judge. The board neatly
side-stepped the issues by deciding that (1)
was a matter for the Auditor-General, (2)
was a political consideration which could
not be discussed, and (3) could be dealt
with later if the necessity arose. The appli-
cation for rescission, of the agreement was
refused, and the new council will have to
go on paying the rates granted by the old
Labor bodies. This result was, of course,
expected, but the introduction of a House
of Lords decision recently referred to in The
Bulletin came as a shock to Labor Coun-
cillors. The decision in question (Roberts
v. Hopwood, 41 Times Law Reports, 436)
was to the effect that where the benefits con-
ferred on municipal employees are beyond
what is reasonable, the councillors responsible
for granting them may be surcharged with
the excess cost on the certificate of the
Auditor-General under the Local Authorities
Act. The Queensland board ruled that this
decision did not concern it, as the Auditor-
General was designated by Parliament to
exercise the function of surcharging default-
ing councillors. This is something which
Labor aldermen should bear in mind when
they feel a fit of generosity with other
people’s money coming upon them. The
Sydney City Council is particularly subject
to such fits. Controlling, as it does, a
sheltered industry, and being always mindful
of the municipal employees’ votes, it pays
niuch higher wage-rates than those fixed by
industrial tribunals for concerns which have
to face keen competition and cannot levy
rates or taxes. This is one of the causes
of the perennial industrial unrest in Sydney.
*
An Australian Motor Industry.
The making of motor-car engines is one of
the two most important industries that have
not yet been acclimatised in Australia. It
used to be the fashion to tell us that it could
not be established here, because there was
not a large enough domestic market, because
a degree of skill was required that Aus-
tralians could never hope to acquire, and be-
cause Australian ventures would be crushed
at the outset by the competition of powerful
foreign interests. Among other things that
were said to be impossible was the making
of steel castings. Within a few years the
biggest bridge in the world will arch itself
over Sydney Harbor, a very impressive monu-
ment to the fact that steel castings can be
made in Australia, and all other sorts of
structural steel as well. The fact is one of
many that encourage scepticism about the
alleged inability of Australia to increase its
footing in the motor trade—a footing that
would never have been obtained at all if
the present-day body-builders and tyre-
makers had believed all they were told by the
Lant-be-done Brigade. Indeed, the biggest
°fi * if f ce P^ s to-day isn’t an Australian at
all, but a Yankee of the Yankees, Henry
Lord, who sees no reason why it should be
any harder to build a complete car in Aus-
tralia, engine and all, than it is to build one
in Canada or any other country with iron
and coal deposits. The latest and most im-
portant development in the matter is the
proposal of the De Haviland Company to
build Moth aeroplanes in Australia all-
metal ’planes with Australian-built engines
According to Colonel Brinsmead, the com-
pany anticipates no difficulty in manufac-
turing in Australia. It reckons that higher
wages paid here will be balanced by the
saving in freight and packing charges. Now,
an aeroplane engine, even a Moth engine,
which is only a baby of 60h.p., calls for a
standard of workmanship higher than that
of all save a very few of the world’s most
expensive car engines. It is a matter of
ensuring an equable balance amongst a rela-
tively large number of cylinders in a very
high-speed rotary engine, and any factory
that could make such motors satisfactorily
would have no trouble at all with the four-
or six-cylinder straight-line contraptions that
move the car of commerce. Australia imports
such motors in increasingly large numbers.
It would not be too much to say that it
spends more upon them than upon any other
single classification of imports. Exact figures
cannot be cited, as almost all car-motors come
in as part of a chassis, and more often than
not with a body and tyres, but the item must
be worth millions every year. The fact that
these motors can be made here —and that it
is a fact is becoming ever clearer—is of first-
class economic importance to a country which
numbers interest payments among its biggest
exports, and which ought to be ransacking
heaven and earth for means of keeping down
its bill for imports.

Sitting on the Safety-valve.
The alleged danger of doing it is evidently
going to be exploited for all it is worth as a
warning against the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment’s overdue Crimes Bill. If the old
safety-valve hadn’t turned up there w y ould
have been a breach in the continuity of
things. Anarchists, insurrectionists, Com-
munists with instructions from Moscow, in-
cendiaries, avowed destroyers and enemies
of society in every shape, including bottle-
throwers and people who won’t pay their
tram-fares, begin to fuss around with warn-
ings that if the Commonwealth takes repres-
sive measures against them it will blow itself
up, and the country with it. If they really
thought so they would cordially approve the
measures, being themselves blowers-up of a
virulent type. The spectacle of professional
insurrectionists urging a Ministry not to
take any precautions against revolution lest
it should lead to rebellion is one of the
humorous efforts of humorless people. It
suggests a murderer who urges, in the wealth
of his unselfishness, that he shouldn’t be
arrested lest he be a worse danger after
hanging than before. In this connection the
tale of Bismarck and his 12 years’ cam-
paign against the German “Social Demo-
crats, ’ and the failure, or partial failure,
thereof, are naturally in evidence. In fact,
the comparison between the doings of Bis-
marck, prince, aristocrat and emperor’s
placeman, and the proposed doings of Bruce,
elected member for Flinders, is the star argu-
ment of the disorderlies. Yet the resemblance
is no closer than that between an old Roman
effort to put down Christianity and a later
Australian effort to put down busliranging.
ie German demands which raised the bile
of W ileiam’s bulky minion included :
Male and female suffrage, vote by ballot, relaxation
of the press censorship, free and compulsory educa-
tion, the right to form trades unions and other
associations, progressive income tax, shorter working
hours, six working days in the week instead of seven,
prohibition of young-child labor, limitation of
female employment in unhealthy occupations, inspec-
tion of mines and factories and regulations to make
them safer and more healthy.
The programme of Australia’s mostly-
imported leaders of revolutionary conspiracy
is somewhat different. Among' its features
are:—
Abolition of the State Assemblies, which are elected
by manhood and womanhood suffrage; abolition of
the Federal Senate, which is also elected by all the
men and women of the Commonwealth ; abolition of
the Federal Commonwealth itself; restriction of the
franchise by exclusion (as in Russia) of the classes
which are suspected of most education; general
seizure of property and its “nationalisation” in the
hands of Bolshevik trustees (this would necessarily
include repudiation of the public debt), though an
immense, proportion of property is nationalised
already; limitation of education, to the glorification
of Bolshevik tyrants; enslavement of the working
classes, whose right to earn a living is to be liable
to cancellation by union bosses; abolition of defence;
stoppage of transport; and a mixed and incoherent
reign of terror.
Seeing that the Bruce-Page Cabinet has
heaps of popular support and a resounding
mandate, and seeing that it proposes neither
to imprison nor deport anybody without
trial, it will probably sit on the valve, pro-
vided Ministers have the necessary energy and
persistence, and not even notice that the
thing is hot. It is a common fiction among
the criminal classes that “language,” the
dissemination of poisonous literature, destruc-
tion of property and industry, assaults on
the police, bottle-throwing and the like are
outlets for popular feeling, and that the
tyrant who tries to stop them is tampering
with a volcano. In reality the conspirator
and bottle-thrower is no formidable creature
if the Law tackles him in a fairly heroic
fashion. He may think he is a valve, but he
is more like a loud-speaker.

His Grace Points the Higher Way.
R.C. Archbishop Duiiig, of Brisbane, is a
youthful prelate for his size in the church,
being only 55, and he has a refreshing turn
of speech. Though he was born near Lim-
erick his soul doesn’t spend all its time in
Erin, and he didn’t absorb so much theology
in the Irish College at Rome as to spoil his
practical usefulness. Some of liis recent re-
marks were reported thus:—
Many hundreds of artisans have been imported
into Queensland, and there is still a shortage. The
fact is that the skilled trades are forbidden ground
for many boys who would willingly enter them. The
door is closed in the faces of these boys in defer-
ence to the demands of selfish bodies, and industry
is often paralysed for want of trained men. If the
native-born youths allow themselves to be denied
trades and are content to remain hewers of wood
and drawers of water in their own country while
their brothers from oversea come in and demand
high wages for skilled work, they deserve no better
conditions than those in which they find themselves.
And unfortunately there isn’t much wood to
hew over a great part of this poorly-timbered
country, and in drought time, which is alto-
gether too frequent a time, the amount of
water to be drawn is limited. In his final
sentence his Grace implied that he has a
very poor opinion of the conditions even
now, and that he regards them as tending to
become worse. It would be a rash person
who contradicted him on either point. An
official Queensland pessimist recently de-
clared that in the shearing-sheds the number
of learners, compared with the number who
had already learned, was as 1 to 30 in
some places and less in other places. Further-
more, there is a tendency to put larger hin-
drances in the way of the education of the
unskilled “hands,” and to lift their financial
status so near to that of the skilled workers
that they will be content to remain unskilled.
There is also a struggle to make the avail-
able wharf-lumping go as far as possible; in
fact, the effort has been carried so far in some
northern ports, where the “rotary” gospel!
took root, that in a very short time the num-
ber of hours required for the discharge of:
a given quantity of cargo has doubled. The:
Sydney Municipal Council is proud of the
fact that during the past year it found work:
for 1151 new male employees; and municipal
employment, except in a few lines, is no'
highly-skilled art. It was explained, how-
ever, that many employees earned less be-
cause the chances of overtime had been
diminished or abolished ; and it was further
stated that if any employee was found
turning his idle Saturday to account
for money-earning purposes, and was dis-
covered doing anything except spend money,
loaf and play, the sack would be sudden and
peremptory. Unionism has thus developed
into an elaborate organisation for stopping
work; but as an apparatus for starting work,
for increasing the supply of work, for devising
new varieties of -work, for teaching how to
turn out work of good quality, and for get-
ting its members good pay for good work, it
leaves everything to be desired. The cultiva-
tion of the unskilled worker, which goes hand
in hand with the cultivation of the no-
worker, costs a lot in payment for the pro-
ducts of foreign-trained industry, and in
loans raised to make jobs for inferior local
industry, and in after losses on the products
of the latter industry. And there is every
reason to believe that it provides Australia
witli a very poor type of citizen. For in-
stance, simultaneously with the appearance
of his Grace’s observations, one District Court
in one day found the following Sydney
citizens guilty of various serious offences: —
William Jennings, 32, laborer.
John Carr, 51, laborer.
John Moloney, 49, laborer.
George Betteridge, 30, laborer.
Norman F. Silvia,, 28, laborer.
Henry James Miller, 21, laborer.
Eric John Major, 19, laborer.
Edwin Roy Cooke, 27, laborer.
Jack Williams, 27, laborer.
Frank Edwards, 27, newsvendor.
Frank Connibere, 21, trimmer.
Ernest L. Connelly, 24, pastrycook.
Richard Beale, 36, bootmaker.
Joseph Messenger, 25, dealer.
George W. G. Baldwin, 17, probably training
to be a laborer.
If is Honor finished up a long, hard day by
discharging a waiter. The list suggests once
more that the unskilled and odd-job commu-
nity is responsible for an absurdly high pro-
portion of the country’s criminality, and
its deterioration and its legal expenses. If
the upstanding and outspoken gentleman who
archbishes at Brisbane thinks he can induce
his own flock, or any part of it, to persist-
ently seek a higher level he deserves all the
luck he will ever get, and something over.

The Sacking; of Sydney.
There is ill feeling in the Sydney Municipal
Labor party because Alderman Wholauan
has been getting more Council billets for his
proteges than Alderman, Finucane. There
is also bad blood between Labor aldermen
and Labor Assemblymen, some of the latter
having secured municipal work (as it is
humorously called) for their friends through
the Government Labor Bureau, contrary to
precedent and aldermanic privilege. These
edifying wrangles have led to the discovery
that 1151 men, who received £214,569 in
wages and salaries, were added to the City
Council staff in 1925, the first year of the
Stokes (Labor) regime. This information
was supplied by Lud Mayor Stokes himself
at the instance of one of the Civic Reformers
who, in conjunction with the Fuller Gov-
ernment, made such a mess of things at the
3924 Council election—ll Labor aldermen
were elected by 13,849 voters, mostly lodgers
and corporation laborers, and four more
were returned unopposed for wards with
6651 electors, whereas 11 Civic Reformers
were elected by 26,514 voters, nearly all
ratepayers. A comparison of the number of
employees on the Council’s pay-sheets in
W. P. McElhone’s Reform year (1922)
with the number added in Stokes’s first
twelve months is illuminating:—

The 1151 new hands are instructed to live
within the city boundaries, so that their
votes may be ready when required. In
common with the old hands, they get the
44-liour week (it is “worked” in five days),
16 public holidays p.a., sick pay and a sub-
stantial advance on union rates of wages ;
and for those on the permanent staff, as the
majority of Council employees are, there
are higher-duties and retiring allowances,
annual and long-service leave, and (because
of union dictation) virtual immunity from
the sack. It was once calculated by the
general manager of the Electricity Depart-
ment, now abroad, that of £464.699 paid in
wages and salaries only £414,732 was for
time actually worked, but these calculations
are discouraged by the crowd now ruling the
roost; the useful, if verbose, reports issued
when T. H. Nesbitt was town clerk have
ceased. For the restoration of harmony
among the Labor aldermen it is proposed
that “each applicant for employment in the
civic service must be nominated by an aider-
man” ; and that, as regards laborers, block-
boys, messengers and the like, “preference
shall be in the alphabetical order of the
aldermen’s names.” The shades of Bosses
Tweed and Croker will doubtless approve.
It is expected that heaps more employees
will be required, for the Council is going

Pearce’s Pipe-Dream.
Dear Bulletin, —Some 50 miles north of
Powell’s Creek telegraph station (N.T.) the
thin thread of copper wire linking Darwin
with Adelaide skirts the eastern border of
a long line of low bush, enclosing a sheet
of yellowish water. The bush extends for
about 10 miles and then gives place to a
bare plain stretching north as far as eyes
can see. Why the long, narrow sheet of
moisture was named Newcastle Waters re-
cords do not show. About 6000 square miles
of the surrounding country was occupied by
the Lewis family in the early days of
Northern Territory settlement and still re-
mains in their possession. Anthony’s Lagoon,
one of the best-known landmarks of the
Northern Territory, lies 187 miles to the
east; after the wet season the intervening
plain is luxuriant with Mitchell and Flinders
grasses. North of the mile-long sheet of
water, on the west bank of which Newcastle
Waters homestead stands, the “Waters” occur
as small pools, the largest being known as the
Eight Mile. Not far from these begins the
famous dry Murranji track, leading over
nearly 100 miles of waterless country to tliefer-
tile western lands. Sixteen or seventeen miles
north of Newcastle Waters are the remains
of Government Bore Mill No. 7. Years
before I arrived at No. 7 the Federal Gov-
ernment decided to establish a bore there.
The boring party spent a considerable time
finding water. Then the casing, windmill
and tanks were brought hundreds of miles
over the bush track from the railhead at
Emungalan. Some bolt or rod was, however,
missing, so the work was abandoned, not to
be resumed. The parts lie scattered around,
slowly decaying in the weather. Newcastle
Waters looms big on the maps of the
Northern Territory. Perhaps that is why
—as I read the other day—Senator Pearce
plans to establish a capital there. At present
it consists of a station homestead, a police
camp and the natural features referred to.
There is not even a telegraph station. Mata-
ranka, the Commonwealth’s experimental
farm, lies 200 miles north. Maranboy, the
nearest township—it has prospects, but not
100 inhabitants —is 248 miles away, and
Darwin is distant 505 miles. The only N.T.
railway stops at Emungalan, after travers-
ing 199 miles 2 chains. Carriage of goods
over the 806 miles of rough bush roads
leading from Emungalan to Newcastle
Waters costs 2s. 6d. and upwards per ton-
mile, and delivery takes from one month to
six months —possibly longer. Newcastle
Waters is cattle country, purely. The
Chinese might raise good crops of vegetables
in the fertile soil surrounding the Waters,
but there is not sufficient of that soil to
warrant the district being described as an
agricultural area. When the North-South
railway is built Newcastle Waters may be-
come a township, but a capital—never. By
reason of its harbor—second only to Syd-
ney’s—and its favorable situation as the
distributing centre for rich agricultural dis-
tricts and great mineral fields, Darwin is
the only logical capital of North Australia.

“Put Queensland First.”
Dear Bulletin, —In a Bulletin article of
January 7 Queenslanders are congratulated
upon the prosperity of sugar plantations
within our State, and honorable mention is
made of our efforts to distil motor-spirit from
waste molasses and cultivated cassava. In
these and other examples of primary and
secondary production a number of our public-
spirited citizens are finding encouragement
for new patriotic propaganda. A body, the
Queensland Preference League, is asking
workers and employers to observe a political
and industrial armistice within the organ-
isation while they endeavor to foster an in-
tensive development of manufactures in
Queensland. The league has perceived that
Queensland, although the richest State of the
Commonwealth in raw materials, is the poor-
est in secondary industries in proportion to
population. The big northern State of sugar,
sunshine, scenery and sapphires provides a
lot of work, wages and, presumably, profits
for thousands of skilled artisans and hundreds
of manufacturers; but they do not work
and have their being and pay their taxes
in Queensland. Queensland planters, graziers,
dairymen, orchardists, miners, foresters and
hunters have preferred, up to this year of
disgrace, to export the more or less crude
products of their toil to distant places, for
the greater development of other States and
nations, rather than support local factories
wherein well-paid labor would supply most
of the requirements of a large population of
prosperous Queenslanders. To correct this
astounding anomaly, the Queensland Prefer-
ence League has proclaimed, particularly to
Queensland trade-unions, the necessity for
extending consistently the policy of prefer-
ence to unionists. “Preference to unionists,”
says the Q.P.L., “connotes preference to the
products of unionists; preference to union-
ists has the immediate purpose of permitting
improved conditions for labor; preference,
therefore, should be extended by trade-union-
ists themselves in their purchases to the pro-
ducts of those unionists who have won the
best conditions of labor.” In pursuit of the
ONCE BITTEN , TWICE SHY.
“It appears that the Premier (Mr. Lang) and his colleagues, as the result of feelers already put out,
are not sanguine that his Excellency would consent to more appointments to the N.S.W. Leg. Council.”

LABG: “But he won’t do it. The last cheque I gave him was a brummy.”
cause of good jobs and high wages, Queens-
land workers may be incited to the permis-
sible direct action of boycotting the black-
leg business of unnecessary imports.—Yours,

“Bilbao” : For some reason or other Free-
trade regards this as a good time to raise
the flag of Everybody’s Industry but Our
Own. Its typical yarn is always that life
would be much cheaper if we didn’t pay
Customs duties. And for that matter we
might save a bit if we didn’t pay interest
on the public debt, and ceased to support the
old woman. A sturdy specimen of the tribe
lately did a preachment in the S. M. Herald.
Apparently he was a stipendiary advocate of
foreign wares, for he appeared as “J. A.
Daniel, president of the Australian Associa-
tion of British Manufacturers and their Re-
presentatives,” which was rather giving the
patriotic and disinterested show away.
Though such correspondents are prepared
to allege that wo would be so much better
off if we didn’t pay millions per annum
in customs and 10 millions in excise, they
never say how the country would pay its
way with more than half the revenue gone.
They don’t even hint how the gap would
be filled if our customs taxation was cut
down to the British level. If the Daniels
and the other lions of the cause propose to
repudiate the public debt and square the
national account by ceasing to pay interest
or principal on the public debt, I am with
them heart and soul, being myself, behind my
K»sual cloak of respectability, vice-president
of the Anglo-Australian and International
Securities Communist Confiscation Associa-
tion. Ou these terms I will go No-Tariff to
the limit, being as willing to ruin Australian
industry as any British agent, providing
there is a quid pro quo. But if the people
who write Freetrade in the papers want
free admission for the sweated boots and hats
of the British capitalistic monopolist and
bloated grinder of the face of the poor, and
yet expect to collect full interest —in other
words, the complete dashed pound of flesh —
out of quadrupled income-tax and amuse-
ment-tax, I am not having any. In a few
words, I am not the maudlin and blithering
ass the hired advance-agents of outside profit-
makers possibly take me for.

Few Australians who sized up the very mixed
and youthful personnel of Uncle Sam’s Navy
when in these parts will be surprised to read
that Admiral Coontz’s confidential report
of the to.ur is very pessimistic. The amiable
incapacity of nine-tenths of the short-service
youngsters from the farm belts, the motor-
service stations and the barbers’ saloons who
made up the crews of the armada was pain-
fully evident, and it was only to be ex-
pected that it would be reflected in the con-
dition of the ships themselves and in such
matters as seamanship and gunnery. It
was the rarest thing to find a member of
America’s, east coast fishing population
among the “gobs.” Diligent inquiry showed
that the navy was the last place in which
America’s fast-dwindling sea-going stock was
to be looked for. The Germans have shown
that they can make decent seamen out of
recruits from inland districts, but they asked
a lot more than a couple of years to train
them, and took care to stiffen every ship's
personnel with a proportion which had salt
water in its blood.

“First Aid” : “An amazing thing that such
a state of affairs should exist in a public
hospital!” said Judge Woinarski at the Mel-
bourne Sessions the other day. And it is.
One Comber was standing in I attic Bourke-
street when a certain Hart came up to him,
tried to pick a quarrel, and, after some abuse,
struck Comber, who fell to the ground and
hit his head against the pavement. lie was
taken to the Melbourne Hospital, where a
young doctor, with somewhat less than a year
of qualification, pronounced him merely
drunk and let his friend have him. In doubt,
they proceeded to put him in a private hos-
pital, and there it was found that his skull
was fractured. He died, and Hast was
arraigned on a charge of manslaughter and
convicted, with a rider to the jury’s verdict
recommending the prisoner to mercy on
account of what hadn’t been done at
the hospital. That Hart should be excused
on the ground that someone ought to have
intervened to arrest the natural consequences
of his blow is illogical; but evidently what
the jury was after was the blood of the
hospital authorities. They may or may not
deserve to be pilloried—it all depends upon
the difficulty of diagnosing fracture. On
this point the profession has given the public
curiously little help. Is there no way by
which the fact that a man is suffering from
a skull fracture can be ascertained V Especi-
ally are there no symptoms by which the
public may reasonably conclude that a skull
is fractured?
♦
“Deb Jong” : S’Africa is giving a large-scale
imitation of the war raging in N. S. Wales
between the Government and the Leg. Coun-
cil. Last year the Nationalist-Labor Gov-
ernment brought in a bill debarring colored
natives of S’Africa and India from engaging
in skilled occupations. The bill was thrown
out by the Senate, but the Government has
again put it through the Lower House. If
the Senate persists in its attitude Hertzog
has the right to call a joint sitting, at which
the large Pact majority in the Assembly
may prevail. The measure is a typical pro-
duct of the alliance between the conserva-
tive Boer and the extreme Laborite. The
Dopper has his own reasons for wanting to
keep the Kaffir in his Heaven-appointed place
as a hewer of wood and a drawer of water, and
Labor, of course, has no use for the skilled
Kaffir or Hindu workers who threaten to
make existence impossible in S’Africa for
the European artisan. If the bill becomes
law, it may conceivably provoke that most
terrible of all social upheavals, a slave re-
bellion. And it would seem that a Sparta-
cus or two to head it will not he wanting,
for at a mass meeting of native mine-
workers held at Johannesburg recently Euro-
pean communists took a prominent part.
These gentry would not last long in a black
uprising, but they are the right type of
renegade to start a calamity which might
overwhelm the civilisation of half a conti-
nent, as well as their worthless selves.

“Centurion” : Great results are expected
in India from a new leprosy vaccine recently
demonstrated before the Indian Science Con-
gress at Bombay by Dr. It. Row. The
vaccine is prepared from tubercle bacilli;
under its influence the characteristic nodules
of leprosy gradually disappear, and the
ulcerations heal. The swollen contours of
the “lion face,” which so distinguishes the
leper from other men, are reduced to normal
conditions under anaesthetic. The treatment
has been well tested in India, and is much
quicker in its effects than chalmoogra oil,
the ulcers and skin patches disappearing in
four or five months. As Dr. Elkington
has lately been in Asia, no doubt the Com-
monwealth Health people will hean about it.
O
“Cecil Poole” : It seems time that a State
like N. S. Wales, which is devoting so much
attention to seeing that big, strong navvies
don’t work more than 44 —and in some cases
40 —hours a week did something to make the
hospitals—country hospitals in particular-
less of sweat-shops than they are. I got my
only first-hand experience of the way in
which young women who enter a nursing
career are exploited as a patient in Lithgow
Hospital, supposed to be a model institution.
A nurse’s work seems to consist partly of
that of a maidservant, partly of what a
patient’s sister might undertake if she had
the necessary knowledge, and partly of duties
that no maidservant would undertake and
mighty few sisters would like to face. Lith-
gow is one of the few hospitals in the State
where the eight-hour shift is in operation.
This means that the nurses and probationers
are on duty 56 hours a week, except for
four months in the year, when they work
63 hours a week. In some of the more grossly
under-staffed hospitals the working day may
extend to 24 hours upon occasion and the
weekly hours average well over 100. The
pay, too, quite apart from the conditions
of servitude, is lower than that of individuals
of the same age and sex in other callings.
I’ve seen a subsidised girl teacher in a State
School receiving 480 a year for 25 hours’
work a week. I don’t say she didn’t earn
every penny of it, but a third-year nurse at
Lithgow gets only £74 a year and has to
buy her own uniforms. Hospital reform
seems to run mostly to improving the accom-
modation for patients in these days, but 'it
was time something was done to stop sweat-
ing and to ensure nurses a fair wage—a 50
per cent, addition to the Lithgow rates all
round, with the exception of the first-year
probationers, might meet the bill for a start.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The A.W.U. convention, meeting in
Queensland, put this lengthy sentence on
record:—
That this convention of the A.W.U. expresses its
deep detestation of the provisions of the Crimes Bill
introduced into the Federal Parliament, under which
leaders of the organised working class in times of
industrial trouble would automatically render them-
selves liable to two years’ imprisonment or deporta-
tion; and, further, this convention denounces the
whole measure as class legislation of a most iniquitous
character, susceptible of being used in the interests
of tyrannical exploiters and union-hating politicians,
and inimical to the freedom of propaganda, and the
peaceful development of the great Labor movement.
That, of course, raises another question for
which it is very difficult, amid the mists of
heated eloquence, to extract anything re-
sembling an answer. The problem might
be put in another long sentence:—
If the “great Labor movement” has possession of
the Parliament, as in Queensland, and has had it for
11 years, and makes the Government, and makes the
laws, and makes the Arbitration and other courts
which interpret and administer the laws, and if it
still says that it can’t supply itself with justice
unless it has full and complete power to violently
interfere with public and other property, to cease
to work it, to prevent other people working it, to
prevent the owners using it, to damage it at pleasure,
to put masses of inoffensive people to loss and incon-
venience, and to practise insult and terrorism, doesn’t
the “great Labor movement” look rather like a
mud-headed brigand, and has it any justification for
its insufferable pose of superiority, and Isn’t it time
that there was some interference (as forcible as may-
be necessary) with its incapable and devastating
career?
The Bruce Ministry offers its Crimes Bill
as the best remedy it can think of for a
crazy orgy of industrial civil war. If the
A.W.U. knows of a better ’ole, it is time to
produce the same.
Clause 98 of the Federal Constitution sftys
under the rather casual heading “Finance
and Trade”:—
The power of the Parliament to make laws with
respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation
arid shipping, and to railxvays the property of any
State.
Apparently it can’t make laws dealing with
private railways, but it can regulate State
railways to any extent. As the Parliament
has been so fussy about making the utmost
use of one-half of the mandate, it might now
like to try its hand on the other half. The
Queensland railways, for instance, seem to
want a few well-selected and vigorously-
applied laws.
Queensland A.L.P. delegates now setting
the State to rights at the Labor convention
at Southport were bucked up no end by the
timely publication of the financial returns
for the last seven months, which showed a
deficit of £670,886. This beat the deficit for
the corresponding period of 1924-25 by
£284,566. Tackled about being a million
to the bad when Labor Premier of Westralia,
“Happy Jack" Scaddan indignantly pointed
out that the million was “all in the pockets
of the people.” In the same way Queensland
is now doing splendidly.
Rymer, Moroney, Foley and three other
luminaries of the Queensland Railwaymen’s
Union, who have been jibbing at signing the
auti-Communist pledge demanded by the
State Labor Executive, suffered a reverse at
the Southport convention. Instead of domi-
nating the proceedings, as they had hoped,
they were told to get out or they would be
thrown out, and out they got. It is expected
that all Hell will now roar, as Ancient Pis-
tol said.
Walker’s, Limited, Queensland’s big iron-
working co., has joined Mort’s Dock on the
shut-up list. The trouble was over a de-
mand for 10s. lid. above the award rate
of £5 9s. per week. One complaint reported
was that the railways paid better. But the
railways had to be helped out of taxation
during the past two years to the extent
of £2,487,564, and Walker’s hasn’t the key
of the Treasury. Yet without it it seems
to do much better for its workmen. Anyway,
according to the Federal Quarterly Statistics,
the State’s weekly average pay was only
£4 18s. Bd.
Agent-General Fairbairn, who has come
back to Vie. on a visit for two months, has
been speaking plainly to the Allan-Peacock
Government about
the borrowing
frenzy. He con-
firms reports that
J. Bull has nearly
reached the limit
of his capacity to
supply Australia
with dirt-job
money, and is not
enthusiastic about
Uncle Sam, whose
emissaries are be-
coming as numerous
as drummers for
Flinders - lane
houses. Samuel,
as Fairbairn
points out, and as
Queensland has
found, is the most
exacting money-
lender in the busi-
ness.
Hostilities be-
tween Victoria and
N. S. Wales appear
to be taking the
following shape.
The Ma State Par-
liament reduces
the working week
from 48 hours to
44, and trade be-
gins to canter
across the southern
border. To tempt
it back, N. S.
Wales reduces
freight rates on
non - paying rail-
ways and steals
business with the
frontiers that
should be going
to Victorian firms.
The Victorians re-
taliate by shipping
their goods by sea
to Sydney and rail-
ing them to Itiver-
ina, thus gaining
the benefit of the
artificially ] o w
freight rates aforc-
s a i d. Meantime
overseas manufac-
turers who do not
indulge in these
manoeuvres get
another leg in. The
chances of the Aus-
tralian dog, which,
whatever name it
answers to in the
various States, is
still the same dog,
overtaking its own tail by these means are
not considered promising.
Apsley, the unusual lordling who has been
getting colonial experience on a Vic. cow-
farm and a Groperland group-settlement,
says in a pleasant jingly way that there’s
nothing in Australia for the Australians or
the English because—
The Scots have the land,
The Jews have the money,
And the Irish have the Government jobs.
Certainly there is a tendency to hustle the
native-born to the back seats, especially on
trades-union executives, but the English
need not complain. For example, English
immigrants of the shop-steward species are
running 'the Queensland Government rail-
ways, of which Frank Hurley, A.I.F. photo-
grapher and film-producer, says that he has
seen nothing funnier in all his travels. And,
if plans materialise, the Sydney Government
trams and the motor-’buses, when “nation-
alised,” are to be placed under the control of
one Gosling, M.L.A., while the railways are
to be handed over, in the Queensland fashion,
to Chapman, secretary of the Itailwaymeu’s
Union. Gosling has been in Australia for 10
minutes, in a manner of speaking; Chapman
for five minutes.
There is news that two big oil-importing
companies, the British Imperial and the
Vacuum, in addition to putting up the price
of petrol, are sending abroad for 1750 oil
pumps (Bowsers). Hitherto the local make
of pump has been reckoned good enough, and
this sudden development of the importing
craze promises considerable loss of employ-
ment. It is suggested that the Government
should do something the size of Kosciusko
with the tariff before these pumps arrive.
But it is a forbearing Government, which
has remitted Tom Walsh’s fines, bar one,
and is still too much of a cherub to demand
that one. Every time the community thinks
the Bruce-Page has decided to be an angry
lion the composite concern seems to turn
into a polite tea-meeting.
If the necessary bill struggles through its
Legislature, France will follow a United
States precedent, and publish the names of
income-taxpayers, the amount of alleged in-
come, and the amount ot tax paid, or owed.
Perhaps it will presently wonder why it
didn’t try this idea earlier. It is reckoned
ANOTHER SNARE AND DELUSION .
“The North-South railway is to be a 3ft. 6in. line instead of the
4ft. St in. adopted as the Commonwealth’s standard gauge."
OPTIMIST: “Aha! Is that the political sanity I’ve heard so much
about lately ?”
PESSIMIST: “No, my friend; it isn't. It’s merely a mirage—a
frequent phenomenon in these parts.”
that publicity will lead to an immense in-
crease of revenue, partly through people tell-
ing the truth about each other, and partly
through them telling a new brand of lies
about themselves, to bolster up their credit
or gratify their vanity.
To tune himself up for the Cocky Con-
gress at Ballarat on March 9, 10, 11 and
12, Vic. Premier Allan is off to Maoriland
for a holiday trip. He will need all the
stamina he can acquire for the • Ballarat
corroboree, as the radical contingent, which
hates composite Governments and likes play-
ing off Liberalism against Labor, w'ill make
its presence felt once more. Nevertheless,
the moderates, who suffer if they do not love
coalitions, will probably be in the majority
when test divisions are taken. What the
moderates fear more is that the Libs, will
demand that Lawson or Peacock should lead
if the coalition of non-Laborites is to continue;
until the next election and after.
Queensland Laborites find it an easy mat-
ter to raise election funds. All they haver,
to do is to apply to the Attorney-General
for permission to hold a “Liberty Fair ’;;
and then the money pours in. “Liberty
Fair” is a euphemism for an orgy of gamb-
ling. Games of chance are nominally pro-
hibited, but so long as the money goes tO'
“the cause” the police know better than to
interfere. A gambling fair at South Brisbane
was openly conducted for the purpose of raising.
Labor election funds, and in order that the
City Council might not butt in it was held
on Government land.
Defects in the Commonwealth Constitu-
tion were mentioned unhelpfully by Irvine,
Vic. ,C.J., when addressing A.N.A. banquet-
eers last week. Divided responsibility for
national finance was one defect, and the;
failure of the Senate to moderate temporary
impulses of feeling as reflected in the Reps.,
was another. Treasurer Page took up the;
parable and declared the Constitution existed
for Australia, and not Australia for the
Constitution. If, therefore, new methods of
government were demonstrated to be neces-
sary and wise, the dead hand of the past
should not be suffered to bar the way.
With that both gentlemen returned to their
dead chicken.
Referring to the chronic housing shortage
in Sydney, a Labor paper recommends “the
building of more houses by the Government”
as “the most logical and satisfactory method
of solving a serious problem.” When last
reported on, the losses on the Commonwealth
Government’s war-service homes were
reckoned at £1,403.935. Nobody has ever dis-
covered how much was fooled aw-ay by the
N.S.W. Housing Board, but a select com-
mittee, reporting in 1923, mentioned that “a
large sum of money has been lost to the
State” because of “gross management, care-
lessness, incompetence and improper con-
duct,” and that “further losses must inevit-
ably be incurred.” And it has been hopefully
suggested in Adelaide that the debit balance
on the Gunn Government’s Thousand Homes
scheme might, if S. Aus. were lucky, be cut
down to £50,000. The “building of houses
by the Government” may be logical, but it
might be less expensive to remove a few of
the reasons which keep private people from
doing the job.
A shameful deed, of a sort to cause Jock
Garden to dance on his Sunday hat, has been
done in Maoriland. The butchers at the
freezing works in one province, having de-
cided that they ought to be getting more
pay than the Arbitration Court had pre-
scribed, planned a go-slow. But the tyran-
nical owners conspired together and produced
a ukase to the effect that in future the rate
of killing would be reduced to four lambs per
hour, and that in order to ensure that but-
chers, who are paid according to the number
of beasts killed, worked their full daily hours,
the lambs would be introduced to the killing-
pens at the rate of one every 15 minutes. It
having been thus demonstrated that two
could play at go-slow, enthusiasm for it had
a sudden slump.
Scullin, M.H.R. for Yarra (Vic.), made
a breathless discovery during the debate on
the small proposal that British vessels (only)
may be licensed for a short term and under
severe restrictions to carry passengers (only)
in the Australian coastal service between
specified ports, if the G.-G. is satisfied that
the tourist traffic is held up. He said it was
a device to break strikes. Scullin’s idea is,
that one of Tom Walsh’s strikes is a divine
thing like a Commandment, and that he who,
breaks it is Lost.
South Aus. has started to value itself
much more highly. The new land-tax assess-
ments —unimproved value—have jumped up-
anything from 20 to 100 per cent. The total
has moved from 70 million sterling to about
300 millions; and one or two of Labor
Gunn’s Ministers wear a much less worried
look.
In a country where wages are strictly
moderate a little Protection goes a long way
and isn’t long about it. The Baldwin Gov-
ernment put a duty on silk goods of wdiich
.1. Bull imported close on £50.000,000 worth
in a year, and it reported lately that 50 new
British silk manufacturing concerns had re-
gistered themselves and were getting to
work.
“Machete”: Re the announcement of the
electoral authorities that some 10 per cenr.
of electors “failed to vote” at the last
Federal elections. After being on the rolls
of Sydney electorate for many years, I was,
at the dogfight aforesaid, enrolled as a voter
for Melbourne city, after the necessary pre-
liminaries, and voted accordingly. ]yfrs.
“Machete,” on a temporary visit to Mel-
bourne, is also on the Sydney roll, and voted
in Melbourne, using the postal ballot. A few
days ago each of us received a notice calling
for explanations as to why we “failed to
vote.” Can nobody devise some simple
means of checking for the Electoral Depart-
ment?
RISKY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The newly appointed M’s.L.C., who have been
promised gold railway passes for life all over Aus-
tralia if they are successful in voting the N.S.W.
nominee Chamber out of existence, are perturbed by
reports that the next Nationalist Government may
repudiate the bargain and that the Commonwealth
and the other States may refuse to honor the passes.”
This symbol on its face conveys
That when and wheresoever
About Australia’s iron ways
I wish to travel, all my days
I’ll do it on the never.
The prospect filled my soul with glee
Till came the cruel rumor
The gaud 1 flaunt so pridefully
May ultimately prove to be
A stumer.
Taunted about the dirty job
For which I’ve been bespoken,
Jeered at by Bavin and his mob
I used to take you from my fob,
My recompensing token.
In you (and Lang) I put my trust,
You seemed as real as cash is
In hand. Imagine my disgust
And rage if you should turn to dust
And ashes!
His thirty pieces Judas got,
Though little did it aid him,
In sterling silver, too, I wot;
At least the currency was not
Debased in which they paid him.
I, too, will earn my hire. No flood
Of scorn my will shall break down.
But won’t my name be worse than mud,
My pass, if you should prove a dud,
A take-down!

The profit was not too bad, but the directors
hasten to add that '‘this was due to the visit
of the American Fleet.” Apart from that,
things are only moderately good. The enor-
mously increased motor traffic is one problem
which has worried the directors. On one
side they see long queues of waiting cars ;
on the other the bridge steadily rising. How
can they cater for the one without being
flattened out by the other? They answer
the question by ordering two new punts and
at the same time deciding that another 1
p.c. p.a. of the value of ship property must
be written off revenue to provide for depre-
ciation and obsolescence. Whether that can
be done without (1) cutting the dividend or
(2) raising fares was doubtful before the
44-hour law was passed in N. S. Wales; and
though the effect of this measure so far as
this co. is concerned is still in some doubt,
it certainly will not make things easier.
Two or three questions have to be
answered before we know quite where we
are in connection with this co. First, does
the shadow of the bridge make heavy charges
for depreciation necessary? The co.’s ser-
vices to many points will not be seriously
affected. Perhaps, with the increase of
population on the North Side as a result of
the bridge, they may even be more profitable.
But the co.’s two goldmines are the Milson’s
Point service and the vehicle punts. Mostly
these carry full loads, at least one way; and
they don’t have to poke about for their
freight. In this respect they are like the
tremendously profitable Silverton Tramway
Co. and the Manly ferry service. With the
opening of the bridge the two goldmines will
be very nearly worked out. _ The vessels
suitable for these services won’t be wanted,
as a general thing, for any other service;
and they must be written down heavily in
consequence. In the second place, is the co.
entitled to 8 p.c. ? Or, rather, is 8 p.c. a
fair thing? On the face of it, the rate
is not too high. There are very good chances
of a lower rate in the future; there are very
poor chances of a much higher rate. The
co. can’t put up its fares indefinitely; with
the bridge built, the competition of the trams
and ’buses will hold the co. in check. So
the possibility of smaller divs. has to be
faced; and public policy will not permit of
much, if any, more than 8 p.c. being paid
by a public utility. Thus far, therefore, 8
p.c. looks the right thing. But there is one
other point. Of the co.’s total net assets of
a little over £700,000 only about £420,000 is
in ships, wharves, plant and stores the
essentials of a ferry co. The balance of
£280,000 is in landed property and invest-
ments, including Commonwealth loans. Can
the ferry passengers reasonably be asked to
provide 8 p.c. on that capital too? That is
the weak point in any claim the co. may
make for increases in fares. There may be
a reply to it. For instance, it may be that
some of these assets are ridiculously under-
valued. The co. has a subsidiary, Harbor
Land and Transport Co., Ltd. (it is repre-
sented by “investments in other cos.,
£107,000”). When the parent’s affairs were
investigated in 1010 the pup was found to
own assets worth 50 p.c. more than the
amount at which they figured in the books.
They are probably worth still more now.
They shouldn’t be in the balance-sheet of a
public utility at all. It is much the same
as if the Gas Co. put a couple of millions
of capital into Government securities, and
then asked that the price of gas should be
put up a shilling or so a thousand to make
up the difference between the 5} p.c. the
gilt-edged security earned and the 8 p.c.
which the co. is entitled to pay on its capital.
Profits admitted by the accounts vary from
those of the introductory table; visible addi-
tions to reserves are included above. Further-
more, the unspecified amounts set aside may
be in excess of requirements for deprecia-
tion and contingencies. “Special” deprecia-
tion was allowed on the new North Shore
steamers in 1922-23-24—1922, £4628; 1923,
£7449; 1924, unspecified. On this occasion
nothing is said about special depreciation —
unless it be included in the remark as to the
additional 1 per cent. Here is a comparison

The final echoes of the loud talk of muni-
cipalisation died away early in the year.
Thereafter was peace and quiet, and never
a suggestion of the hot fight which had raged
throughout 1924. However, 1925 _was not
entirely uneventful. Shipowners increased
freights on September 7 by 6d. a ton, and
coalowners raised the price by Is. 6d., in
each case “to cover increased working costs/’
Although only affecting the last quarter they
involve a future charge of £34,000 p.a. Those
items and the shipping strike and a minor
dispute at the West Melbourne works pre-
vented the co. from making any reduction
in price.
The cessation of the mostly ill-based poli-
tical agitation was a relief ; nevertheless, since
the Board is businesslike in its methods, as
each scrap is finished the pieces are cleared
away and it prepares for the next attack.
It has plenty to occupy its attention. For
a number of years the co. has been manu-
facturing on crowded city sites. The dis-
abilities have precluded efficient coal-hand-
ling ; have limited storage; have made the
adequate treatment of by-products difficult.
What is needed is a new site with deep-
water frontage which would permit of the
installation of large-scale labor-saving appli-
ances. Apart from the absurdity of un-
economic manufacture, the co. cannot much
longer do its job within its crowded areas.
Increasing population calls for increased pro-
duction, and the limit must be within sight.
The co.’s chief engineer, J. N. Reeson,
thought it was in sight six years ago. The
idea of a new area is bound up, of course,
with finance; and here an amendment of the
Act governing the co. is deemed necessary.
As the estimated cost of providing adequately
for the expansion of the city up to 1930 is
£5,000,000, the co.’s demand for security is
quite reasonable. The scrip has been favored
in the past because the investing public con-
sidered the protection afforded by the Act of
’7B reasonable. New money will be forth-
coming only if investors can see an equally
clear guarantee.
From 1913 to 1924 the div. was an un-
varied 13 p.c. The 15 p.c. of the last IS
months is a comfortable return, but much
of the gilt is taken off when it is remembered
that issues of new capital have carried heavy
premiums, and there never has been a bonus
distribution to offset them. This table shows
the movements:—

Shareholders are entitled to a return on the
£627,738 no less than on the £1,100,000.
Up to 1924 that return wasn't anything be-
yond 8.2 p.c. on money subscribed. The
15 p.c., however, improves the return to 91
p.c.
Under the Act of 1878 no restriction was
imposed as to expenditure out of revenue, and
big sums were put into wrnrks, etc., that well
might have been charged to capital. Here
are figures for 10 years:—
Year ended Repairs and Works, etc., Paid

Last year was filled with constructional
activity. Plant was and still is being im-
proved ; additional carbonising units and gas-
holders were erected or proceeded with, no
less than six of the latter being involved,
three being of three million c. ft. capacity.
On working account last year’s principal
items were:—
1923. 1924. 1925.
Cost of coal .. .. £671,139 £595,952 £599,128
Revenue from gas . . 1,234,256 1,333,121 1,281,312
Revenue from residuals 285,952 284,970 291,485
Increased return from residuals is a good
feature. It would be an easy matter to
justify increased divs. if the increase repre-
sented profits won from by-products. Last
year over five million gallons of tar, 3487
tons of sulphate of ammonia, and 356;035
gallons of ammoniacal liquor were produced.
The co. pleads that if it had a new site
the entire tar output could be distilled and
the distillate treated so profitably as to allow
of reduction in the price of gas. Unfortu-
nately the 80-acre area at the mouth of the
Yarra is still a dream, and consumers are
being penalised because of the delay.
Here is a comparison of balance-sheet
figures:—
1915. 1924. 1925.
Debentures.. .. £907,000 £1,584,200 £1,584,200

At the moment the position is quiet. Con-
sumers are without any general grievance,
which means that the politicians are content
to forget the co.’s existence.

This is the solid little co. which in April
last amalgamated with the fire, marine and
accident branch of the Commonwealth
General to form the Commonwealth Traders’
Insurance Co., Ltd. The new co. acquired
all the shares in the Traders, but as the
accounts of the C.T. will not be available
for many months the Traders’ figures serve
as an indication of the possible results of
the new co., which is reported to be “pro-
gressing very satisfactorily.” These figures
tell of steady growth in underwriting:—

They tell also of a continued high loss rate
and expenses which, though not immoderate,
refuse to be restrained. Heavy losses must
be accepted as a normal condition of Island
business, but in the last two years they have
been heavier than usual. Profits, of course,
were affected, the surplus being the smallest
in the co.’s five years. An amount of £1523
undistributed balance from 1924 has been
transferred to a reserve for bad and doubtful
debts; it is included in reserves of the intro-
ductory table along with the reserve for
unexpired risks. Policy-holders are well pro-
tected : allowing 40 p.c. as a necessary pro-
vision the £10,376 was £lBl2 in excess of
the amount required. Nothing brilliant, but
quite solid. Balance-sheet figures show these
movements: —

The parent co. can reasonably expect 8 p.c.

investments was more than sufficient to
provide the dividend.

If the profits claimed by the accounts were

make a snail jealous. But they are written

plain how the figures in the introductory

the position clearer :

What was set aside for wastage of mine pro-
perty isn’t specified, although it is admitted
that there is an “inner reserve” to meet this
inevitable decay. The following sums up the
balance-sheet position as at December 31
(capital remained unaltered at a quarter-
million) and affords a comparison over recent
years:—
1922. 1923. 1924. 1925.

Fixed assets.. 347,221 367,196 358,036 345,007
Liquid assets.. 71,921 63,414 95,217 133,441
The co. owns mines on the Newcastle field,
chief being Wallsend, but Pelton Colliery on
the Maitland field, which has been producing
since 1919, is its main source of profits.
Pelton alone should be worth more than the
figure at which fixed assets appear in the
books. And the old pits are well equipped
and by no means worked out. Pull equip-
ment of Pelton and modernising of the
Wallsend plant was completed two years
ago, and liquid assets have been accumulat-
ing. Last year they increased by £36,779
net —a pretty good indication of what is
being put by for the contingencies, etc.,
mentioned above. The co. is in a very strong
position, and the market’s opinion of the
£lO shares—£ls 17s. 6d. —is quite reason-
able.

Two years ago a New Business Department
was told to “go to it,” and the directors
report gratifying results. There has been
little in it for shareholders thus far, but the
co. is impressing the people of substance in
its field by its steady building of reserves,
and the better things should come later,
even though the hoped-for brightness hinges
on the funerals of its friends. The co.’s
earnings are not helped much by the fact
that £10,004 of its funds is in 3 p.c. Vic.
inscribed stock (face value £11,390). Nor
would there be much in the other interest-
bringing assets: £4464 in Commonwealth
stock and other investments (face value
£4750) and £350 mortgage. But they doubt
less pay 80 p.c. of the modest div., which
means that most of the earnings from the
business are available to build up reserves

The extra p.c. was cautiously labelled
“bonus.” But the margin between net profit
and the distribution was fairly wide, and it
is likely that the true profit was considerably
more than the amount claimed by the

for contingencies, depreciation, etc., and in-
surance which are not included in the nom-
inal reserves of the table (nominal because
of the goodwill item —trade-marks and secret

contingencies and depreciation grew last

by £B9O, and the chances are that some of
both of these was true profit. Apart from

The consistent maintenance of its full capacity is
one of the many recommendations that influence the
use of Pioneer Wood Pipe. When first installed it
will carry from 15 to 20 per cent, more fluid than
any metal pspe, and this flow will increase instead of
decrease as the years go by. The reason for this is
that the interior bore becomes smoother with the
friction of the constant flow. This smoothness pre-
vents the accumulation of organic growths or similar
obstructions, and rust is, of course, unknown. The

should also assist earnings. Although 21
p.c. was given as “bonus,” the manner in
which the co. has been expanding the mami-
facturing side, plus the other factors, indi-
cajtes that so long as the present prosperity
holds the 124 p.c. is possible. And there

When the war-time blockade threatened to
deprive Germany of supplies of nitrates,
essential to the making of explosives, some
spectacled Teuton remembered that Germany,
like every other country, carries twenty
million tons of nitrogen to the square mile —
in the atmosphere. It was a case of “so
near and yet so far,” but means of extrac-
tion were patiently devised. Ever since the
war other countries have been making use
of the discovery, since all the world lias a
use for nitric acid, ammonia, agricultural
nitrates and the other nitrogen products. It
is now quite a big industry in the United
States, France, Belgium, Norway and
Sweden, and an enterprising European con-
cern, the Nuske Power, Fuel and Nitrogen
Co., proposes to introduce the process to
N. S. Wales. Land has been bought not
far from Sydney, and a factory that
will employ 3000 hands will be erected.
Later on it is hoped to extend the scope of
operations tenfold. Share capital is held
abroad, it is said, but a local co. is being
floated to sell suburban lots and erect houses
for the company’s employees in the neighbor-
hood of the works at Penrith (N.S.W.) or
thereabouts.

“Ellesdee”: The prospectuses of Maori-
land forest-planting cos. have always re-
minded me of the project for breeding rabbits
—or was it wild-cats? —and making un-
limited millions by the sale of the skins.
I have been reproved so often for letting my
mind flow into such channels that it comes
as a shock to find that Macintosh Ellis, Maori-
land Director of Forests, seems to share my
suspicions. In a paper he read at Dunedin
Exhibition, Ellis said the best advice he
could give to prospective investors in for-
estry companies was: “Go and plant your
own forest.” Failing that, before putting
money into any of the 30 existing cos.
capitalised for an average of £50,000 apiece,
he advised a close examination of the teeth
of the proposition, an insistence on a clean
bill of health from solicitor and banker con-
cerning profit-earning capacity, protection
against fire risks and a few other things—
including liability to share salesmen.

Copper production is increasing despite
the low price (the 1925 average for elec-
trolytic was £67 os. sd, compared with £6S
6s. 2d. for 1924). Average monthly produc-
tion last year, according to the figures of the
American Bureau of Metal Statistics,
amounted to 128,207 short tons compared
with 121,623 short tons for 1924, 113.016
for 1923 and 79 553 for 1922. Consumption,
however, is keeping pace; but any increase
in demand will easily be met, for the Ameri-
can mines and those of the Belgian Congo
can produce far above their present output.
Of Australian producers Mt. Lyell alone is
operating on full scale, and it is believed that
there will not be any surplus for export.
High costs rule out Australia from playing
any important part in the world market.

Umberumberka was to have put an end
to water trouble on the Barrier, but the
mines are facing the possibility of a restric-
tion of output unless rain falls heavily and
quickly. The mines have been winning mag-
nificent returns —the workers are also doing
very well, thank you—and it will be hard
lines if Jupiter P. goes on strike and ties
things up. The bonus system has worked
quite satisfactorily. It is significant that in
the Silver City there are over 3000 motor-cars
for a population, mostly industrial, of
25,000.

B. H. Junction North squeezed out a bob
div. the other day—it still plugs away at the
treatment of some of its old dumps and the
remnants of ore left in the mine. Tommy
Palmer has dropped out of the management
after 20-odd years of strenuous -work and
lawsuits—his fighting instincts made some
hard dents in the co.’s cash box. H. V.
Seale, who has been associated with the
metallurgical end of the J. N. Co. for many
years, is now on deck.
The B. H. North (with its companion the
British) continues to lead in output and pro-
tit. Developments in both shows have ex-
ceeded expectations, and George Weir shows
his well-known contempt for the limelight
in the almost colorless reports he issues. A
bonus issue of shares is expected. The big
De Bavay plant is now in the hands of the
North, and it is not unlikely that the huge
slime dump on the latter property will be
turned into concentrates when the water
position is clearer.

Tin glia Tin (N.S.W.) got five, tons froth
13,000 yards for January, during which time

20,000 yards a month has been forgotten.

There is a report of payable gold having
been struck in the Heroic, on the Herberton
field (N.Q.): It is an old show that may blossom
in new spots', as. prospectors are sinking on
a foot of stone bulking 2oz. to 3oz. gold. A
crushing from an old shaft close by on a
' reef varying from lft. to 4ft. wide gave
lSdwt. and encouraged the prospectors to try
some of the surrounding crops with the above
results. The country is a mixture of slate
and Quartz, and further payable finds would
not create any surprise.

Dr. Jensen has once again weighed the
pros and cons, of oil prospects in Queens-
land, and has come to the conclusion that
two formations deserve active investigation,
viz., the Walloon (jurassic) and the upper
permo-carboniferous western areas. The
former has been tested to some slight extent
both at Beaudesert and Roma; likewise the
Longreaeh bore, which has brought up the
greatest quantity of oil yet obtained in any
bore in Australia, is in that formation. So
no one will argue with Jensen that there
are not commercial prospects, in view of the
Roma and Longreaeh evidence. As to the
permo-carboniferous coal measures, there is
not much of a peg to hang this hope on so
far. Jensen generally uses carbon ratios a
good deal, but of course hasn’t any to quote
for the submerged . western areas, where he
would like to bore; and those from the Car-
narvon Range are too high, if carbon ratios
count in Australia, as they certainly do in
the Appalachian fields in U.S.A. His sug-
gestion that the oil indications in the Central
West artesian bores are probably seepages
from the permo-carboniferous hasn’t much
weight behind it.

Hampton Properties, Ltd., announces that
it is marking time on its show at Block 45
and is pushing ahead deeper development on
the Celebration mine on Block 50 (W.A.).
Some time ago the co. reported that with
Hampton Gold Areas, Ltd., it had backed
the reconstruction of the Celebration, and
that sufficient capital would be provided to
prospect this show, which has been a bitter
disappointment to date, at greater depth.
At the height of the Hampton boom in 1919
the Celebration was purchased by London for
£50,000 cash and £125.000 in fully-paid
shares. At that time interested persons
with shares to unload boosted its prospects
and declared that it was the backbone of a
second Golden Mile. The market soared, and
the knowing ones got out. The co.’s capital
was soon spent, and it raised more by deben-
tures. Later on funds again gave out, and,
to add to the co.’s misfortunes, the manager
was burnt to death. Present operations in-
clude further development below 400 ft.,
where prospects are fair. It is possible that
exploration in deeper ground will expose
some good stuff, but the chances of the
property ever paying divs. are remote.
# # # «
Apparently London-controlled Westralian
goldmining cos. have been told that the
State Labor Government is a good sort.
Golden Horseshoe got heavy backing from
it on the strength of probable good develop-
ments and impossibility of carrying on with-
out a loan, and now Sons of Gwalia and
other cos. are clamoring for assistance. In
the case of the Gwalia the plea put forward
is that high cost of production and low grade
of ore is crippling the co.. and that unless
help is given the undertaker will get another
little job.
* * * #
Following the requiem of Bullfinch (W.A.)
the State Government as mortgagee bought
in the deceased’s mine and plant at auction
on Jan. 22. The property was seized by the
bailiff for a debt of £3OOO. This sum was used
to drain and sample the Gladsome and Sand-
Queen goldmines at Comet Vale, which the co.
was forced to abandon, as shareholders
bucked at calls.
* * * *
Wiluna Gold Corporation (W.A.) has
got off the mark quickly. It has started to
open up its property, and is now deciding
upon the type and size of plant best suited
for ore treatment. At present the co.'s
experts favor the flotation process, but no
decision will be reached on this point until
further experiments have been made. At
300 ft. down, where the crosscut penetrated
40-odd feet of payable lodestuff, good devel-
opments are expected at an early date.
• * * * *
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.),in its 1925
report presented to shareholders in London the
other day, described the future as hopeful if not
cheerful. About the middle of the year shares
more than trebled their market valuation on an
official report that 9-oz. ore had been stabbed
in deep ground, and in order to sustain the
market something was said about the proba-
bility of other rich finds being made. However,
nothing worth blowing about was struck,
and as the 9-oz. ore didn’t continue, shares
came back to their previous price.
* * * *
Emu Co. has sprung a surprise by throw-
ing up its options at Wiluna (W.A.). Some
time ago it reported that a bore had struck
gratifying widths and values, and then
waited in vain for the market to rise. The
co. is one of several ventures controlled by
Adelaide brokers, and as the public didn’t
rush its shares when the Wiluna float was
announced, it apparently decided to give up.
It is a pity that others of the same type
don’t follow suit —their departure would be
a gain to the field.
* * * *
Mararoa (W.A.) is about to take up
another collection. This time the appeal for
funds is backed by a report that the mine
will pay in future, but nothing is said con-
cerning plant, which is inefficient, arid a
new shaft, which is imperative. It is simply
throwing money away for the co. to carry
on under present conditions, and any indepen-
dent expert who has a reputation to lose
would, if called in, say so.
• * « *
Westralia’s gold yield goes from bad to
worse. January’s 29,3010 z. was the lowest
monthly total since 1896, when Coolgardie
was talked of and Kalgoorlie had scarcely
started production. Returns from all pro-
ducing fields in the West are unsatisfactory,
some more so than others. This is due to
the exhaustion of the richer reefs, lodes and
alluvia] deposits, and to increased working
costs, which prevent stone at one time pay-
able being mined and treated at a profit.
Operating against any substantial improve-
ment in the output is not only the lack of
fresh finds, but the impossibility under pre-
sent conditions of reopening low-grade pro-
perties. Speaking at the recent annual
meeting of the Westralian Mining Associa-
tion, president Frank Moss complained of
the burdens placed on industry, and declared
that they would inevitably lead to the cessa-
tion of gold-mining in the West as a great
industry.
* * * *
Apparently Glenelg Hills, in the wilder-
ness south-west of Southern Cross (W.A.),
is not as good as reported. Assistant State
Mining-Engineer Blatchford, after inspect-
ing one of the principal shows there, reports
that the formation is ill-defined, gold values
erratic, and the ore unpayable in bulk.
Other areas in the vicinity were recently
declared by interested persons to have favor-
able prospects; but, as The: Bulletin has
previously remarked, something more than
favorable prospects are required nowadays
to attract option-seeking cos. of slender
resources. In most cases they must get
hold of something enticing enough to bait
the call-hook.

Tongkah Compound’s discarded suction-
cutter dredge at Mantin Setul (F.M.S.)
treated 343,202 cubic yards for 106 tons
oxide during the year to September 30. On
this near-|-lb. ground the bottom was not
approached in many parts. Inclusive of
£6103 in divs. from the No. 2 co., income
was £21,754. The available amount was
£13,322 of which £13,000 was written off the
suction-cutter and £322 carried forward,
against £4178 brought in. The installation
of the suction-cutter proved very expensive.
The dredge, which has been taken over in
part settlement, is in the accounts at £SOOO.
As £6OOO in cash has been received since
the balancing date, any sum above £2OOO
received from the sale of the suction-cutter
will be profit. Holders will be heartened by
the announcement that the bucket-dredge
will be financed to the productive stage
without calls. At September 30 the till con-
tained £10.725, and shares in the No. 2 co.
were valued at £24,965.
* * * *
Takuapa, Siam, got 50 tons tin oxide for
January from 150,000 yards, which is full
capacity for the dredge, according to official
data from time to time. It is apparent that
“Tak” hasn’t anything much better in sight,
for the yield is above the average. Since
June, when the dredge had its first real run,
yields have been : June, 100,000 c. yds., 21
tons oxide; July, 100,000 c. yds., 45 tons;
August, 115,000 c. yds., 42 tons; September,
80,000 c. yds., 39 tons; October, 145,000 c.
yds., 59 tons; November, 130,000 c. yds., 39
tons; December, 115,000 c. yds., 42 tons;
January, 150,000 c. yds., 50 tons. A sub-
stantial bonus is due for collection by the
dredge staff, coolies included, when GO tons
is posted as a month’s output, and October
got closest to it. As the co. has an outsize
in dredgable areas, the issue of the 35,000
reserve shares at a premium and application
of the new capital towards construction of
a second dredge would appear to be the most
businesslike course.

“St. Clair” : A perfectly ghastly happening,
and one that has given the Shaky Isles a
worse shock than was ever engineered by
seismdlogical means, is reported from the
Dunedin Exhibition. Governor Fergusson
was being shown the rounds —a fine old
sport with a twinkling eye and a rather
fastidious taste in drinks. Arrived at the
Auckland Court, the party was invited to
sample the vintages of the northern province,
and his Ex. chose port. Others chose sherry.
Glasses were emptied in unison, and then
there was a strange, uncanny silence. His
Ex. broke it. “Er was that alcoholic
liquor?” he asked. There were profuse assur-
ances from officials that in very sooth the
stuff contained the Demon. But Fergusson
knew better. “I should like you to make
quite sure,” he said in the strained accents
of one whose palate had had the most awful
surprise of 60 years. And then they found
that those who furnished the stall had
equipped it with bottles of colored water!
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: The 18-year-old son of
a backblock sheep-farmer was sent on his
first visit to Adelaide. He was a well-grown,
handy sort, quite capable of looking after
himself, and full of suspicion about all towns-
men after the many warnings he had received
of the pitfalls awaiting him. He bore a
letter of intro, from his father to the latter’s
agent, and turning into the right street the
first man he approached to be directed about
the address was the man himself. After a
glance at the name and address on the letter
the agent proceeded to open it; the next
moment he was smitten on the jaw by an
outraged youth, who snapped the letter away
and made off, fully believing he had struck
one of the dreaded confidence men. Half an
hour later the bewildered lad found himself
face to face with the same man in his office.
* * * *
“Noslen”: The discovery of a Queensland
volcano that wasn’t there reminds me of a
volcano that arrived in Maoriland 70 years
ago. The steamer Lady Grey put into Wel-
lington one day in March, 1855, with a cir-
cumstantial account of how one of the peaks
in the Kaikoura Range had broken out into
eruption. They had seen, according to one
of the Breezy City’s
newspapers of that
date, “wreaths of
white vapor rising
in a thin and un-
steady column from
a high and conical-
shaped mountain,
culminating in a
canopy of smoke.”
There was so much
talk about the dire
things it might
mean that a wrhale-
bo a t was sent
across Cook Strait
to reconnoitre.
What it found was
that, some old shep-
herd had been burn-
ing off fern on the
range and had set
fire to a clump of
white birches on
the summit of Ben
More.
“Avon”: A can-
didate for the His-
torical ‘Leapstakes
is Frank Halligan,
of Christchurch
(M.L.). He was
found in a bedroom
where he oughtn’t
to have been in one
of the city pubs,
and when they be-
sought him to stay,
so that the police
might make his
acquaintance, h c
jumped out of the
nearest window,
which was on the
third floor, and hit
the asphalt road-
way with a thud.
Scrambling to his feet, he ran like a hunted
M.L.C., pursued by an excited mob. The
mob caught him and handed him over, none
the worse for wear, if you disregard a few
slight cuts and bruises, probably made in the
capture.

“Miro”: Twins often find it easy to trade
on their resemblance to one another, but the
record of a pair in a Sydney suburb would
take some beating. The two girls had an
invalid mother, and as one had always to
be at home they decided to take it in turn
while they jointly qualified to hold a job in
a small city office. Week about was the
arrangement, and as the boss was frequently
absent the plan worked successfully, that
gentleman being unaware that he was em-
ploying what you might call a duplicate
typist. If anything wanted elucidating it
was done per telephone, and each girl kept
a careful record of’ the day’s work and re-
tailed it to her sister for future use. Dis-
covery came when the boss went on an un-
expected .jaunt to the Mountains and met his
typist, whom he thought in Sydney safe-
guarding his interests, motoring on the Jeno-
lan road. After explanations had been made
he confessed that he had not had a glimmer
of the truth, though lie admitted having occa-
sionally found the typist forgetful and a bit
slow in the uptake.
CHEERING UP FATHER.
“I say, Dad, they are very hard to deal with."
“What are?"
“A sticky pack of cards.”
“Bart” considers the relative driving-
power of wives and poverty:—
A wife at worst may drive a man to beer,
His temper growing desperately tauter;
But poverty, my friend! is ftir more drear—
For poverty can drive a man to water.

“Wallaby” : I considered myself highly for-
tunate when I was allotted to Magdalen
College, Oxford, for my officer’s training
course, for 1 had read much of its. historical
associations, and it thrilled me to think of
seeing with my own eyes Magdalen Bridge,
the Cherwell, Addison’s Walk and the May-
day choral ceremony on the tower. But I
left Magdalen with most of the ancient
memories obscured by modern ones. First
there were the Prince df Wales’s football
boots—at least, the aged,, tip-seeking retainer
in charge of the bath-house swore that they
were the Prince’s. Then it was discovered that
the common-room of our platoon had been occu-
pied by Oscar Wilde in his undergraduate
days. And I never hear Magdalen Bridge
mentioned without a picture rising in my
mind of a Digger who dived fully dressed
from the parapet, and eventually rose from
the shingly bottom of the Char unharmed
—but still as drunk as an owl. Most per-
sistent of' all is the memory of one college
dignitary who took no part in our corporate
life. I still see him, with his head well
down on his chest and his goggly, preoccupied
eyes, and I can almost hear that shuffle of
his as he slowly picked his way through the
cloisters. Doubtless he was a massive scholar,
but we only knew* him by the sobriquet some
irreverent Digger had fastened on him —
“The Creeping Barrage.” Enriching asso-
ciations? Still, when we pip-candidates were
there, at least those stone w’alls lived.
* * * *
“Woorook”: A motor-car is no longer a
guarantee of affluence. Two ladies in a tram
were discussing a third who had been seen
out in her car with a gentleman not her
husband. “Joy-riding, I 'suppose, with a
gentleman friend?” suggested one. “Oh,
no!” explained the other. “She was just
taking him out for a breather. That’s the
bailiff.”
* * * *
“H.G.D.”: Returning from the delivery of
a message to brigade headquarters, two of
our platoon got completely lost in a net-
work of trenches, and floundered along,
sometimes thigh-deep, in mud for nearly an
hour with all the profanity demanded by
the occasion. Suddenly they were brought
up at the point of the bayonet by a Tommy
sentry’s “Halt, who goes there?” “Friends!”
answered one. Then his cobber spoke. “I'm
Burke,” he said; “this is my friend and
fellow-blanky-fool Wills.”
* * * *
“Schnorrer”: A model Sydney charity
is the Jewish Aid Society, which makes
small interest-free advances to the poor
of the race to enable them to start
work of some sort —the loans may vary
from £1 to buy a pair of decent boots
to £4O to provide working capital for
a small business. The society, which
has lent over £30,000 since it started opera-
tions and received back over £28,000 (which,
as £2500 was lent only last year, means that
it has struck few, if any, “bad marks”), was
founded in Sydney 30 years ago by Aaron
Blashki, who has been its president ever
since; it followed the lines of a similar
society formed in Melbourne years before by
his father. These advances have set many
a struggling Jew on the road to prosperity
and even affluence. One of Vic.’s wealthiest
Israelites of to-day made his start with a
hawker’s pack secured with the £25 —then
the limit—advanced by ■ the Melbourne
society.

“The Frequent Lover”: An American
scientist, Charles Kellogg, has shown how
fires can be extinguished by vibrations. By
producing a screeching sound with an appa-
ratus like a violin-bow, which he drew across
an aluminium tuning-fork, he reduced a two-
foot gas flame to a spluttering inch or two.
lie believes that all buildings of the future

There’s little new in such a thing,
Nor of its truth have I a doubt ;

That put my fire of passion out.

“Merris” : It isn’t only the suburban villa

ceived his farm from the Soldier Settlement

nabobs and set out in high spirits to occupy
it. All his sisters and his cousins and his
aunts came down to see him off, and as the
train steamed out of the station they lifted
up their voices and cried aloud: “Buck in
well, old boy!” Then and there he decided
to name his holding “Buckinwell,” and he
says it keeps him from slacking on the job.

SPEED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not the least amazing thing about the twentieth
century is the rapidity with which the future
becomes the present.” —S. M. Herald.
The world goes rushing onward till its changes are
a blur—
You’re passing things five miles ahead of those that
catch the eye;
You’ve hardly kissed a pretty girl ere you’re divorced
from her;
Your shout of greeting to a friend comes to him
as “good-bye.”
We speed along the tracks of life so staggeringly
fast
The future is the present ere the present is the
past.
I don’t know why this reckless pace some hearts
should fill with glee;
I like to eat my breakfast ere to-morrow’s lunch
is due ;
And being shot from here to there has no appeal
to me—
’Tis what may lie twixt there and here I most
desire to view.
The pleasures that I know, and love, for long I want
to last,
And keep the future as a hope until the present’s
past,
“We’ll fly to London in a week,” men boast. I
wonder why.
London will be but Surry Hills unless it’s weeks
away.
NOT IF IT’S AN EQUESTRIAN EVENT.
GRANDMA: “I see the dear Prince has had such a nasty fall from
his horse again. I wonder if the poor hoy will ever reach
the throne ?”
FLIPPANT YOUTH : “Not if he has to do it on. horseback, Gran."
Twill lack its spell without the lure of bizarre
ports that lie
Enchantresses upon the route to lure the heart
astray
With sweet exploring fancies, till w'e make the
anchor fast,
And dawdle with the present in the towns of ages
past.
But men keep stoking up the world and crowding
on the steam;
They don’t know where they’re going to, but
still, with hooting horn,
The racing madmen scoot through life and scare off
ev’ry dream,
And men may die of old age yet before they’re
fairly born!
Oh, life is but a shade itself before its shadow’s
cast;
The future is the present ere the present is the past.

“Nakhoda” : Has anybody noticed the ex-
traordinary series of acts of Providence
which have occurred lately and which
might be interpreted as acts of retributive
justice? Leaving out of consideration the
happenings connected with the violation of
Tut’s tomb, a president of a rationalist
society in London fell dead immediately after
delivering a spirited attack on Christianity.
If Christians drew any moral from it, their
triumph was short-lived, for presently an
English divine expired in the pulpit in the
middle of a denunciation of rationalists.
William Bryan was stricken in the middle of
his anti-evolution victory at Dayton
(U.S.A.), and now a chairman of committee
of the Dutch Reformed Church falls dead

not believing that the serpent had that little
affair with Eve was under discussion. Evi-
dently Providence, like a good umpire, won’t
take sides.

“Mako”: Now that so many small country
towns are achieving the distinction of post-
offices, the village postmistress is passing
away. I knew one dear old thing who was
a joy to her callers. Over the
counter of her husband’s store she dispensed
the mail with appropriate comment. Watch-
ing her one day sorting a pile of postcards
when they were a new craze, I remarked
that they must have increased her work
considerably. “Yes, indeed,” she agreed.
“It’s double, by the time you’ve read ’em all,
both sides.” But the outgoing mail was her
chief interest. “That’s the third time Molly
Brown has written to her rich uncle this
month,” she once remarked, examining a
letter critically; “the mortgage must be com-
ing due pretty soon!”
NOT CURIOUS.
“But didn't you stop when you heard the scream?”
“Why, no. I knew I'd find out all about it in next day's paper.”
‘Seebee”: One of the first cases iC. H.
Book, the new Vic. Assistant-Crown Prose-
cutor, had to handle stepped straight out of
the movies. Disappointed because a rival
had won the girl both had wooed aboard ship
on a voyage from England to Melbourne a
year ago, Harry Hord, a seaman, set fire
to the nest at Malvern which the rival had
built for his bride. Hord, who had obtained
a temporary job as kitchenman at State Gov-
ernment House, was pictured stalking out at
night, fortified by stimulants, to take revenge
on the pair who had made life blue for him,
afterwards admitting to the police that
r-r-revenge was his motive. Fortunately
neighbors suppressed the fire before it had
made any headway. Hord protested his in-
nocence, and accused the police of being
too imaginative; but the jury convicted him,
with a recommendation to mercy.
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.
"Darling, docs this rouge suit my complexion?”
“Can’t say, dearest —never saw your complexion.”
“Jesmond” : Recently in a Vic. country hotel
a man bet that he could get an ivory billiard
ball into his mouth. He performed the feat
easily, but found himself quite unable to
eject the mouthful. Owing to the hard,
smooth surface, it was impossible to get a
grip on it. The local M.D. said he
could do nothing without dislocating the jaw,
but this was declined by a vigorous shake of
the head. For nearly two days the poor
devil carried his burden. Then a dentist
came to the rescue; breaking off a tooth,
he drilled a hole in the ivory so that a grip
could be got on the ball, and it was yanked
out at the expense of several other teeth.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: The stone lion that tried to
bite the M.D. painter (B. 7/l/’2fl) reminds
me of an earthquake experience at Samarai,
Papua. A carefree and thirsty quartette
were playing bil-
liards in the old
C o s mopolitan
Hotel. The three
balls were bunched
together in the
centre of the table,
and the thirstiest
player was owlishly
regarding them as
he pondered on liis
next shot. As he
gazed, all three
balls danced to-
wards each other,
and after describ-
ing a giddy little
circle, came to rest
in the “as you
were” position.
When he could
move, our friend
jambed his cue
hastily in the rack,
and had refused
..... , ,„ , three invitations to
drink before he could be persuaded that the
trouble was merely due to a “shake” from
Mt. Victory, up Cape Nelson way.

“Midford”: Whether or not Peary ever
reached the North Pole, “Henry Horsecollar”
is hardly correct when he states that “Roose-
velt, just emerged from a long spell as Presi-
dent and about to start for Africa, took up
Peary with a roar of applause before the
voice of doubt could express itself and the
matter was settled” (B. 4/2/’26). Roose-
velt could have taken no part in the first
discussion that Peary’s claims evoked, for
the simple reason that he was in Africa; he
expressly mentions in his preface to Peary’s
“North Pole” that the news about the Arctic
feat reached him when he was somewhere
near the Equator. The same book discounts
the assertion that Peary pursued Cook as an
impostor till “that luckless individual hadn’t
a shred of reputation left” —and presumably
started on the downward track that leads
to floating bogus companies. There is only
one allusion to Cook in Peary’s book and
that the briefest: evidently Cook was not re-
garded as worth wasting ink on. The fact
is that, after Cook’s brief period of celebrity
at Copenhagen, during which he pulled the
legs of various ornaments of science and
journalism, his collapse was so utter, his
exposure so complete, that there was no need
for anyone else to brand him as an impostor.
He went the. way of De Rougemont—and
Arthur Orton—without any shoving from
behind.
* * * *
“Blanc”: After the Armistice military
precision slackened considerably in Prance
and Belgium. The pace of at least one train,
however, increased a good deal. During the
war no train in the north of F'rance was
ever knowm to average more than six m.p.h.,
but from Charleroi, in January, 1919, ours
hit up 40, and would have hit 100 had it
been possible from such an engine. Our
sympathy for the Tommies led three of us
to invite the guard to help us carry our
souvenired jar of rum from our cold car-
riage to the warm engine, and to offer the
driver and fireman a nip. Before we had
left the few lights of the still-darkened city
very far behind we had become so friendly
that the Tommies suggested making the rum
hot. It was goodo! Before we reached Ath
we lifted the fireman and guard on to the
tender to snore without interrupting us. The
driver was most obliging, and opened out
to please us. “We want to get to Blighty,”
we told him. But such a pace through
Leuze, where we seemed to bump over hun-
dreds of points, required another good nip
to steady the driver. So I held the lever
while he nipped. It was too hot to swallow
quickly, so I held it for five miles before my
mates lifted him up alongside the fire-
man and guard. After that we let the engine
have her own way mostly. “Only—hie—two
of us now !” said Charles at last. “Lemme
—hie—drive! You stoke, Bill.” “Righto,
Charlie. Steady up when you pass St.
Omer,” I said. I would have stoked had I
been able to get the coal without tipping
out the sleeping crew. As I couldn’t, and
as I felt drowsy, I climbed up with them.
I thought Charles could manage without me;
but he must have jerked the wrong lever, or
perhaps the engine wanted more fuel, be-
cause we stopped somewhere near nowhere,
and Charles climbed up alongside of me.
When day dawned a crowd of Diggers
strolled along from the carriages. _ I awoke
to see one rattling the jar. “Cripes!” he
ejaculated, “no wonder they hit up the pace!
A whole S.R.D. to six of them!” It was
10 o’clock before we got up steam sufficient
to carry us to the next station. “St. Pol!
Cripes, -we’re on the wrong line!” exclaimed
the guard. “A blanky good job, too!” re-
plied the sobering driver. We reached Calais
nearly two days overdue, via Etaples, having
explained to several officers along the line
that the Tommies were not to blame for the
engine’s erratic conduct, and that some silly
signalman sent us on that track.
* * * *
“Alwyn”: Do you know a queerer matri-
monial mix-up than this? A theatrical pro-
prietor, who toured N.S.W. up-eountry
towns, secured a divorce from his wife and
married a member of his company directly
the decree was made absolute. The bride’s
brother, who managed the troupe, then mar-
ried his boss's first wife, and the whole bill
travelled the country for years in entire good-
fellowship.
* * * *
“II.K.”: The hooraying turn recently
staged in the gallery of the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council by Robert Emmet O'Hal-
loran recalls an even more un-Parliamentary
demonstration that once came from the
gallery of the Assembly. Thither drifted one
Robert Youll on an unusually dreary even-
ing, and, after a brief stay, drifted out again.
Presently he returned with his pockets filled
with stones, and interrupted a particularly
long-winded orator by hurling down several
pieces of road-metal at him. Warming to
his task of criticism, Robert then pelted
every member in sight, and was not over-
powered until his ammunition was exhausted.
An attempt to prove he was mad failed;
some people held that he was particularly
sane.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: Governors have their crosses,
but I wonder if more than one of them was
ever refused “strap” at a pub. This hap-
pened to Jerry Smith, ex-banker, who was
Westralia’s figurehead 27 years ago. Jerry
had been induced by a mining-company pro-
moter, who was so busy tryir f to make a
fortune that he sometimes forgi A to pay small
accounts, to take a trip through the gold-
fields, as far as Lake Way. At Nannine,
after the railway had been left behind, the
expedition ran out of lager, and the mining
magnate sent to a pub for a few cases. But
this particular Bung harbored a grievance
over an unpaid bill, and he said bluntly
that if Blank wanted the beer he’d have to
show the color of his money first. The emis-
sary returned to the main party with the
gloomy news. The travellers were poorly
supplied with ready cash, and finally his Ex.
himself undertook to shoulder the liability.
To that end he despatched a hyphenated aide-
de-camp to the pub to ask that the beer
should be supplied not to Blank’s order, but
to that of the Queen’s representative. Bung,
however, reckoned on getting an old account
paid as well as a new one. and flatly refused

to modify his terms for a Governor or anyone
else. He even went so far as to direct liis
visitor’s attention to a notice bearing the
legend—not an uncommon one in W.A. pubs
of those days—“To Trust is Bust, To Bust
is Hell,” etc., and suggested that he should
convey the gist of it to his boss. The party
went on to Peak Hill beerless.
VAVASOUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘He gave his name as Lance Rollo Vavasour,’
said a woman whose front name was Clarice, giving
evidence in a ca.se in which a man was charged with
having gone through a form of marriage with her
while his wife was alive.’’
His manners were the sort that live
In heroes built by Ethel Hell;
A handsome dial was his chiv;
Upon the fair he east a spell.
He made her muse upon the days
When splendid knighthood was in flower
And gentle chivalry ablaze;
He gave the name of Vavasour.
No common Tom or Jack was he;
“Lance Rollo’’ was (or so he said)
His christened right ; and Clarice she
Was gratified such names to wed.
For Clarices and Christabels,
Yvonnes and such, a magic power
In monikers- high-sounding dwells;
He gave the name of Vavasour.
No Lancelot was Lance, alas !
He proved to Clarice but a dud.
That which she counted gold was brass,
The idol’s feet have turned to mud.
’Tis only bitterness recalls
The high enchantment of that hour,
When, in the prince of lordly drawls,
He gave the name of Vavasour.

J. W. Shannon, just dead in the Holy City,
was the big South Australian —6ft. sin.
high and about 19st. in weight—who in 1914
was returned to the Federal Senate by a
record majority. The veteran McGregor had
died after the nominations were in, and the
Labor party, having to vote a full ticket,
agreed on the popular Shannon as the least
undesirable of its opponents, so that he got
the votes of both sides. He held the seat
till 1920, and for the last three years was
Chairman of Committees. In earlier hie
he had represented Yorke Peninsula and
Wallaroo in S.A. Assembly. He was a
farmer for many years, but after moving m
to Adelaide went into partnership with his
fellow politician Richard Butler in the stoc.v
and station business.
C. J. Maxwell’s death at 74 the other day
recalls his connection with Charley Eady s
world’s record score for first-class cricket
of 566, made in April, 1902. for Break o
Day against Wellington at Hobart. A.wo
afternoons’ batting saw Eady’s score pass
300 and the batsmen of his side almost alt
gone. So "Max” was sent for. The veteran
hadn’t handled a bat for a dozen years, but
succeeded in holding the wicket for six hours
before he was caught out near the chains.
His score was eight—a sixer and two singles.
Alex. Bannerman was a slogger compared
with Maxwell. And he was very like
that as a banker. General manager of the
Commercial of Tasmania until the E., b. and
A. took it over five years back, Maxwells
care and conservativeness w r ere punctuated
by a few big risks that mostly resulted m
losses. All the same, he was a valuable
servant.

A naturalist who was also a writer of
note, and had among his friends Darwin,
Huxley, Swinburne, Russell Wallace, Oscar
Wilde and G. A. Sala, was Professor S. B.
J. Skertchly. He came of a Leicestershire
family which traces itself back to the famous
Guy Earl of Warwick. The first step in his
career as a geologist w r as a post with the
Khedive of Egypt, after which he discovered
evidences of human existence in the glacial
era in East Anglia, his conclusions being
supported later by the eminent Dr. Geikie.
He was Professor of Botany at Hong Kong
for some years, and many of the latter years
of an active life were spent in Australia —
he was first president of the Queensland
Naturalists’ Club and of the Royal Society
of Queensland. The end came at Nerang
at the age of 76.
“Rizzle”: Prof. Paterson, who stretches
out of the chair of agriculture at the W.A.
University, has a dry humor to go with his
N.B. accent. He had been addressing a
cocky audience at Moora. and when the
chairman inquired at the close whether any-
one would like to ask the Professor a ques-
tion or two, a vefy earnest-looking corn-
coaxer upended himself. “Suppose,” he said,
“I had two paddocks of equal area on which
the agricultural conditions were identical, and
one I sowed with 30lb. of seed and 601 b. of
super., whilst the other I sowed with 601 b. of
seed and 601 b. of super, and got the same
yield—what would the Professor say about
that?” Paterson arose to his six feet. “I’d
say,” he replied in pairfect Seo-tch, “that
ye’d wasted thairty bushels of seed!”

Morris Symonds, who gave £5OOO to the
Hebrew University at Jerusalem, is off to
inspect that college as part of a trip round
the World. Symonds is President of the
Sydney Zionists, and, as such, probably
ranks as head of the Zionist movement in
Australia. One of his hopes is to bring
back, on a lecturing tour, Dr. Chaim Weiz-
mann, the Zionist leader, to interest southern
Jewry in the ideal of a restored Palestine.
The Hebrew community is wonderfully re-
sponsive to such movements. Israel Cohen
was able to collect £58,000 from the Chosen
in Australia for the British Umpire Jewish
War Memorial.
Dayboro, in Queensland, claims Australia's
oldest inhabitant- —a Mrs. Mullins, who, it
alleges, will be 115 in May. She married
twice, and her second husband died nine years
ago at 96. When she was over 90 Mrs. Mul-
lins used to milk 40 cows, and her only
complaint now is that her eyesight is not
what it used to be.
During his brief term in the N.S.W'.
Assembly, the late Dr. Stopford made a
thorough inspection of the Ma State’s men-
tal hospitals in conjunction with other mem-
bers of the Lunacy Commission. When
visiting Kenmore he detached himself from
the main party, but half an hour later re-
turned, smiling, happy and content. His
fellow members were anxious as to what
new scandal he had unearthed. But there
was no scandal. He had been at the Asy-
lum’s stud farm discussing pigs with the
manager. “And,” he added. “I found it
much more interesting than Parliament.”
“Rabbi” Friedlander, who became shep-
herd of the Brisbane Chosen 12 years
ago and carried on for six years, died in
the northern capital last week. Though
given the courtesy title by Gentiles, he was
r.ot even a rev. on his first visit to Aus-
tralia. He arrived as a traveller for meer-
schaums and similar articles, and became well
knowm in commercial circles in most Aus-
tralasian cities. He was always ready and
able to take a leading part in Synagogue
services; and when the Newtown (Sydney)
Hebrews decided to form a congregation of
their own, they did not find it very difficult
to induce him to accept the leadership. Sub-
sequently the northern congregation sent
him a call, and the Avorld-travelled and
tolerant cleric made himself a popular Bris-
bane identity. He was 76 when he died.
N. S. Wales once had a Treasurer who
kept the cash in his bedroom. This was
William Balcombe, who had previously
helped look after Napoleon on St. Helena,
he lived in Bent-street, where the C. S. R.
Co.’s office stands. Part of his domicile he
used for an office, and in 1826 he applied to
Governor Darling for a grant towards the
rent, which was £l5O per annum. The Gov-
ernor decided to pay half, gs the Treasurer
not only gave Up part of his house for offi-
cial purposes, but “actually for the better
security of public money kept it in his bed-
room.” Balcombe was afterwards given an
office in Barrack-square.
Among those in the running for the Presi-
dency of the Senate is Senator Lynch, the
fieriest orator in a funereal Chamber. A County
Meath man by birth, he migrated to Aus-
tralia 40 years ago, and has been ship’s
fireman, union secretary and miner, A
member of the Boulder Council from
1901 to 1904, he was Groperland’s first
Labor alderman, and for a number of years
general secretary of the Goldfields Engine
Drivers’ Association, He was first elected
to the Senate 20 years ago, and when
W. M. Hughes re-constructed his Ministry,
following the conscription split, Paddy was
made Minister for Works and 'Railways.
Vic. Education Department continues to
supply men _to other departments for big
jobs. Both I'. J. Rae, the iiew director of
the Botanic Gardens, and W. W. Gay, the
new Forest Commissioner, began as school-
masters, and each won the B.Sc. and other
degrees at Melbourne ’Varsity. Rae worked
up to principal of Burnley Gardens and Gay
to supervisor of school forestry plantations.
From those springboards they jumped into
their present £BOO-a-year jobs. Within the
last three years Thomas and Akeroyd. two
school-inspectors, became secretary of Child-
ren’s Welfare Department and Inspector-
General of Prisons respectively. Justice
Isaacs (of the High Court), Weldon (Income-
tax Commissioner), Peverill (Under-Secre-
tary of Lands), McPherson (Public Service
Commissioner). Metzner (Comptroller of
Stamps) and Farthing. Bond and Hughes,
M’s.L.A., are a few others who commenced
their careers with a piece of chalk in one
hand and a blackboard-wiper in the other.
“Lobby Lizard - ’: Arkins and Bagnall,
Nationalist members for St. George in the
Ma State’s Assembly, were among the 17
Labor members expelled from the A.L.P. in
1916 over the conscription issue, and are
the only two now in Parliament. Arkins,
a small, irrepressible person with exuberant
black curls, is incessantly upon his feet,
emphasising whatever he has to say with
extravagant gestures and a wealth of adjec-
tives. Bagnall is a complete contrast to
his old colleague, being tall and cadaverous
and a rather tedious talker. In the old days
he w-as secretary of the Process Engravers’
Union.
Diggers have lost an old friend in A. W.
Maconachie, whose firm put up the Irish
Stew ration. After experience with bully
beef and “the meanest man on earth” (that was
he who skimped the pork in the tins of alleged
pork and beans), a “Maconachie” vras a
rare delight. The old man, wdio has just died
at 70, was a member of the House of
Commons for six years, but missed his way
into Parliament more often than he found
it. He wms the actual inventor of the tinned
meal the Diggers prized, and maintained so
high a standard that he has a better right
to lie quietly in his grave than most army
contractors.
Like A. A. Alam, George Dewar, M.L.C.,
who declined to break his pair with Dr.
Kater at Lang’s bidding, has to thank Minis-
ter Dunn for the letters after his name.
Dewar, who wms appointed in 1921, is the
political discoverer and sponsor of the nowa-
day N.S.W. Minister for Agriculture. Six-
teen years ago he enticed that worthy from
the chair of a bush school of 11 pupils to
have a shot at the old State seat of Mudgee.
Dewar is a maltster by trade, having for
many years managed the brewery at Mudgee;
he makes a hobby of geology.
“Hamer”: Towards the end of the war
a Digger artist and myself were in the
office of the editor of one of the London
papers when he broke off his conversation
for a quick discussion with a member of his
staff upon a proposed feature. “Let George
do it,” wms his verdict. We had to explain
our mirth ; we were, of course, reminded of
the advertisement of a Sydney dentist. The
editor’s reference was to W. L. George, who,
from writing books of no particular conse-
quence, came into fame during the war as
a publicist of the popular order, w T hich caused
lrim eventually to take himself as seriously
as his public, editors and, recently, the cables,
have taken him. Born in Paris 43 years
ago, George crammed a good deal, including
three marriages, into his short life. His
first two wives died. In his youth he served
with the French army. During the war he
was in the British Ministry of Munitions.
A Maorilander who means to breast his
way up the steep where fame's proud altars
shine is J. W. Mellor, an Otago University
product, wffio was sent to England as a
scholarship holder and gained his doctorate
in science. Besides acting as consulting
chemist for pottery manufacturers, he has
in hand a work which medical journals claim
will contain all that chemical research has
revealed. Four volumes of this “Compre-
hensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoreti-
cal Chemistry” have appeared, and two more
are in the press. They are tomes of over
a thousand pages apiece.
After serving Vic. for 51 years in various
capacities, from office-boy to Deputy-
Commissioner of Land Tax, Murtagh
Murphy has retired at 65. Whatever place
he held, whether he was inquiry clerk in tin
C. R. LONG,
recently retired
after 49 years with
the Vie. Education
Department, during
SO of which he was
editor of the school
paper.
Lands Department
or assessment
officer in the old
land-tax office
(where, under the
guise of a territory

No civil servant

tration they didn’L

sion he will draw.
Maurice Joseph O'Reilly, C.M., besides
being rector of St. John’s within the Uni-
versity of Sydney, has been appointed Pro-
vincial of the Vincentian Fathers in Aus-
tralia. Few priests are better known
throughout Australasia. Before succeeding
Monsignor O'Brien at St. John’s, he was
for years president of St. Stanislaus College,
Bathurst (N.S.W.), which is in charge of
the Vincentians. Besides being an authority
on Gregorian chants, O’Reilly can turn his
hand to a poem, a joke or a patriotic Austra-
lian song, and make a creditable job of it.
In the fervor of the early war months he
wrote certain patriotic verse, entitled “Right
to the End,” but later, because of happenings
in the land of grievances, he regarded his
effort as a misdemeanor.
The most consistent vote-recorders of the
N.S.YV. Parliament are, with one or two ex-
ceptions, men who have no other claim
to attention. Alldis, Keegan, McClelland,
Davidson, Ely and O’Halloran (Laborites)
and Hill (Nationalist) each attended the full
147 House divisions of last session in the
Assembly, and of these the first four and
Hill also attended all the 126 divisions
in Committee. Little is ever heard of most
of the bunch; but Theo Hill is the well-
meaning enthusiast whose screams are a fre-
quent embarrassment to his party, while
Robert Emmet. O’Halloran’s tongue is always
a cause of uneasiness to his fellow-Laborites.
“Eureka”: Corporal Sid Williams was
known in the (A.1.F., as the Autograph
King. He laid himself out to secure the
signature of every notable during the war
period, even managing to gain admission to
Buckingham Palace and obtain the auto-
graphs of a number of royalties. Most of
the celebrities yielded to his importunities
good-humoredly, but an exception was Gen-
eral Pershing, who rebuked him for wasting
his time collecting autographs while the
Americans were endeavoring to win the war.
However, Pershing’s name appeared at the
foot of the reproof, and w r ent into Williams’s
album with the rest.
Only these 25 Victorian ex-members of
Parliament hold free gold railway passes for

titled to Executive Councillors’ passes for
life, 48 members of the State Parliament and
two Federal members, but they have gold
tickets, anyway, to enable them to travel
in performance of their duties; so they are
not counted.
Vic. Upper House has no sirs in its ranks

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He counts his splendid medals o’er,
With trembling lingers makes them clink ;
But he shall know their gleam no more
In eyes that have black wine to drink.
In eyes that have black wine to drink —
Ah, gleams shall stir his heart no more,
Who stands where velvet shadows sink,
Alone upon a lonely shore.
Alone upon a lonely shore,
Deep wrapped in shades that sink and sink,
He turns his worthless medals o’er
And waits forlorn upon the brink.

Mr. F. J. Hartley, of Palomine, Cumnock, writes, Novem-
ber 27, 1925: —“I am on a very rough piece of land,
with hundreds of hollow logs which the rabbits live in.
Five weeks ago you could see 150 rabbits in one burrow.
Since I have been using the Blower, I don’t think you
would see a hundred if you rode all over the place. You
can kill them in logs as long as the dust can get past
them. I used one tin in two days when I started, but now
a 51b. tin of Cyanogas does me four days.
It puts the man on the land in a better

KNEW WHEN HE WAS WELL OFF.
“ I’m surprised you don’t stop this begging and get a job.”
“Wot! Give up a sure thing an’ ’ave ter take me chance? No fear!”
“Bullwlianger”: Castaway on the island
of Utupua, in the Santa Cruz group, I once saw a
“coon” making a set of Pan’s pipes. I thought
these things only existed in mythology, but this
was the dinkum article. He had eight pieces of
bamboo ranging from an inch to about six inches
in length. These he lashed tightly together and,
cutting a notch in each one to make it sound, sat
down and played a mournful ditty on it. I had
hopes of adding it to my collection of Island junk,
but it was for a “big-feller dance” that night; and
the next day we were picked up by a recruiter, who
took us into Tulagi, so I forgot all about it. But
the dance, or “danis,” was worth watching. The
music consisted of tom-toms in the form of blocks
of hardwood which, when hammered, emitted a
clicking noise, such as a jazz drummer beats out
on the rim of the kettle-drum; also several leaf
squeakers, an ancient mouth-organ and the pipes
described. All the dancers yelled or howled dismally,
and those who were not holding palm-fronds, flowers
or junk smacked their bare stern-sheets vigorously
and in time to the tom-toms. All hands were
dressed in leaves or weirdly-painted matting, or
else were outlined with lime to resemble skeletons.
The musicians sat about a small fire, and the dancers
hopped, walked or pranced round and round. Nearly
every dance was the. same as the others; all started
to very slow time, but were jazzed-up later on.

“R.J.R.”: Mt. Gregory (Q.) has recently
startled people living in its vicinity by giving
vent to loud rumblings. It has also the habit of
clothing itself in a cloud. At first this cloud was
mistaken for smoke, but investigations have since
proved that it is a haze due to atmospheric condi-
tions. This business has been proceeding at inter-
vals for 30 years past. Perhaps a scientific explana-
tion may be found in the radio-activity of the
elements contained in the water and gases deep
within the mountain. The whole district, as far as
Mt. Morgan, is geologically associated with thermal
springs of volcanic origin. Old residents of the
district believe the recent occurrences to predict
floods, as the rumblings were particularly loud just
prior to the great overflows of ’96 and ’97.

“Percy Piebald”: S.A.P. in potatoes and
a couple of over-size rat-traps having failed to
prevent the sweeter grasses being torn up by bandi-
coots on the second and third greens of our golf
links, I now seek a means of despatching the vermin.
Can an} r learned or other member of the council
supply it?
* * * *
“A.R.W.”: At various times and from
different sources yarns have come in concerning a
tigcr-cat inhabiting the Queensland scrubs, large
and fierce enough to defeat an ordinary dog. Also
at various places in Eastern Australia skulls have
been found of a creature scientists call Thylacoleo.
These skulls show' a short, broad head about as big
as that of a bulldog. The teeth are among the
most curious known to science. The front or biting
teeth are like huge rats’ teeth, but are pointed in-
stead of being chisel-edged. Its side chewing teeth
are 2in. across and sharp-edged. It is difficult to
see what these teeth were for unless the animal
that owned them had the habit of jumping on the
back of its prey and ripping the top of its skull
off. The curious matter is that while the skulls
are fairly common the rest of the skeleton has not
been found.

“Up Top”: Binghi believes love-charms to
be invincible. They
vary according to the
witch-doctor who com-
pounds them. His
charms arc, of course,
far more potent than
those of an ordinary
individual. The philtre
has to be swallowed
by the object of the
lover’s attentions. It
is a powder whose in-
gredients are a secret,
but here are some of
the ordinary compo-
nents : The ashes of
a full-grown (rn ale)
lizard of a dwarf
variety, the ashes of a
few hairs from Romeo’s
armpit, a tiny pinch
of pituri ash, water-lily
seeds powdered and a
seed of wongai. These
are mixed and “sung”
over for hours. It is
the doctor's “singing”
which gives a “kick” to
the mixture. He it is,
too, who places the
love potion in her kai-
kai. A more universal
charm is a small wood-
carving attached to a
string which Othello
whizzes round his head
when some distance
from the camp in the
dead of night. As the
charm vibrates he sings
of his overpowering
love. This song is
supposed to be taken
up by the charm,
whose insinuating
“whir-rr-rrr” carries
it to the ears of the
sleeping beauty.

Murkah’ : Guessing the precise weight of
a dressed bullock is largely a matter of luck. At
Numurkah (Vic.) Show in three seasons the experts
all hovered round the correct weight, but none
actually bull’s-eyed it. The first year a lady
milliner hit it to half a pound without seeing the
animal. She said afterwards that had she seen
it she’d have guessed two tons. In the two follow-
ing years of my residence a dentist and a parson
v\ ent closest. At the same show David McNamara
went within slb. of the correct weight and did it
for five years in succession. But that was judgment
—Dave was an expert. ‘
“Ishmael”: The myths of history have
issued a new edition in the recent telling of the
story of the events that occurred when the Keightley
homestead was stuck up by bushrangers. The modern
Version as given by an S. M. Heualu correspondent
states that it was Gardiner's gang that performed
on that eventful night and that Mrs. Keightley,
starting in the midnight hour, galloped into Bathurst
holding her baby in front of her; then, having
obtained 500 of the best, by a house-to-house search,
she rode back with the baby and the gold in time
THE SOLO PERFORMER.
DAD: “Wot were yer doin’ to let ’er kick it over?”
CHUM: “Nothing whatever, sir; she did it on her own initiative."
to redeem her husband. That is how the story
was told in a weird drama called “The Ride for
the Ransom,” performed in several country towns 30
years ago, except that baby did not figure in the
representation. The bag did—a very small bag; but,
of course, money went much farther then than it does
now! The real facts of the matter are to be found
in the evidence in the case of R. Cheshire in the
N.S.W. Law Reports. Ben Hall led the gang, and
it then included Burke, Vane and Cheshire; Gardiner
had given up business at the old address some time
before. Mrs. Keightley did not ride anywhere. She
was driven “in a gig” by Dr. Peachey to the house
of her father, Mr. Rotton. He then drove into
Bathurst and from the manager of the Commercial
Bank obtained 1(>0 fivers, and with these drove back
to the Keightley home, picking up Dr. Peachey on
the way. They then took the numbers of the notes,
and Dr. Peachey went to the bushrangers’ camp,
Mr. Rotton deeming it prudent to stay where he was.
Arrived at the camp, Dr. Peachey, no .words being
spoken, handed the notes to the nearest bushranger
and Mr. Keightley came home to breakfast. In a
casual sort of way, Mr. Cheshire rode into Bathurst
two or three days later and did some riotous living
on the proceeds of some of the fivers; and the
police, acting with an intelligence that was
noticeable only by its absence in the earlier proceed-
ings, arrested him. The defence on the trial was that
Dr. Peachey had not been threatened with any
violence, but had acted as a sort of Father Christmas
and had handed over the notes with a view to the
above, or something like that. But a hard-hearted
Court on appeal upheld the conviction, and Mr.
Cheshire was duly presented with 10 good long years
of p.s.
* * * *
“Knalpi”: In the early days of the West-
tralian goldfields it often happened that a friendly
nig, especially if occasionally given a trifle of
tea or sugar or part of a tin of “dog,” would bring
to the tent of a fossicker small pieces of gold
specked by him. One day an abo. came into one
of the “good-pfeller” tents with a piece slightly
larger than ordinary, and the fossicker said:
“Good boy! This one pennyweight.” At once the
nig, having in mind the most widely-circulated coin
in his experience, said: “No fear! That one
tchillin’-'weight.” He got it.
* * * *
“Jeanong”: “Centre” asks if anyone can
tell him the name of the N.Q. tree whose sap is
used for dressing cuts. Perhaps the white gum is
what he wants. It is used by the blacks to bind
cuts and heal wounds. They also chew the leaves;
this mess, clapped on a bleeding wound, will stop
the flow of blood and if left undisturbed heal the
wound rapidly.
* * * *
“Ess”: A selector neighbor of ours was
“Forky.” His sheds, yards and cultivation fence
were all built with forked uprights. His slide for
drawing water was a fork, with a cask across the
prongs. Whenever anything about the place wanted
propping up, he cut a forked sapling. The fork, in
fact, was as generally useful to him as hollow logs.
His smallest were pronged sticks which he used for
forking hay, grass and com husks; they ranged
upwards from clothes-props and grindstone-bearers
to the poles that formed his gallows. And he usually
carried a forked stick about with him for pinning
snakes by the neck.
“Parama”: The pawpaw-tree is not the
only vegetable with blossoms so heavily scented as
to be injurious to health. Tuberose, stephanotis,
violets, lily-of-the-valley and some of the orchids
are all taboo to certain public singers and speakers
on account of their perfumes affecting the nerves
and relaxing the throat. There is a jungle tree iD
India whose waxy white blossoms fill the air with a
fragrance that induces sleep followed by violent
headache. Similar effects flow from a yellow-flowering
tree in New Guinea and from another that grows
in the north of Australia. Even our own gum-
blossoms carry a scent too strong for many people,
inducing dizziness and headaches. The narcotic-like
properties of the scent of the pawpaw flower are
well known wherever the tree is grown, and that’s
in pretty well all tropical countries.
* * * *
“H.W.”: If caught young, cassowaries
make very good pets. When chicks, they are sold
by the natives in New Guinea, and the birds grow
up to know their master. When fully grown they
are very mischievous, and especially troublesome in
the garden or with the toys of the children. They
have been known to follow their owners on to the
native-police parade-ground, and when the men
were forming two-deep or fours the birds peeked
at their bare legs, a practice not conducive to
steadiness in the ranks. Cassowaries are sometimes
smoke-dried and used for soup. Their stiff feathers
are often mingled with the beautiful plumes of
birds-of-paradise to form the headdresses of warriors.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: The New Guinea ’possum is
a hefty chap. I have shot specimens weighing up to
261 b. The young—till they reach a size greater
than our black ’possums—are a creamy white. I’ll
never forget the first time I heard two fighting.
We were camped in a locality where anything
was likely to happen, and at about 2 a.m. the most
ANOTHER STRIPE TO HIS SLEEVE.
“Isn’t he a dear! So tender with the ladies!”
“Yus—more like a friend than a copper,
ain’t he?”
blood-curdling screams brought us up all-standing.
We thought some of our boys were getting it in
the neck till a coon told us what the noise was.
It takes a good dog to kill a kapul, as the ’possum
is called there. The flesh is quite palatable, and is
much esteemed by the natives, who also make use
of the fur for decorating their headdresses.

One that a mother held richly dear
For that he was an only one?

Never a hand he had in war,
Nor voice to shout its praise or blame;
Never a care for the empty score

Nay, if you seek his like to find
Do not search in the ways of man :

And streams are dry or far to span.
Go out, go out to the spreading west,
Where still they breed them “of the best.”’

My hands are groping for the rein !
Soft is the breeze that is on my brow.
And true the steed I ride again—-

God knows they, too, were “of the best.”
Let them lie there, deep down and cold,
That went with me by night and day.
Only remember their hearts were bold
When we were mates through gold and grey—
When we were mates across the west,
And mates again where now they rest!

That died as western steeds would die!
Dumb things (how oft have I heard that said!)
But knew they not the reason why,
Those horses of the gleaming west
We buried with our other “best” ?

“Atherton”: Environment plays queer
pranks. A white resident in China for 50 years
assures me that the growing slant in his eyes is
purely a matter of environment. He tells of cases
where white mothers have given birth to children
with slightly slanting eyes, the only explanation
being that the mothers had for many years looked
on slant-eyed children. I know, of my own know-
ledge, that white men living among the niggers for
years unconsciously take on many of the black man s
characteristics.
“Bokeen”: In the middle ’eighties, when
Tyson was replacing cattle by sheep on his large
tract of country’ between the Beechel, Warrego and
Paroo rivers, he gave ss. a scalp for wild horses.
Most of the slaughter was done with the rifle, and
the trophy was like the dog scalp—two ears with
the strip between. Twenty-five y’ears ago some of
the finest wild horses in Australia were running in
the Blackwood Ranges (W.A.). The method used
locally was to stun them with a rifle bullet in the
roots of the mane, just behind the head. These
were shot for use, never for scalp money. Further
south, on the Kalgan Plains, there used to be a
breed of small brumbies with big draught-horse
heads which the local natives caught by driving into
a network of ropes stretched through the long
kangaroo-grass.
WASTE.
LIGHT-FINGERED CYRIL (caught red-handed ):
“Cripes, just me stiff luck—paid a deener
this morning for a ’air-cut.”
“H.E.R.” : “Avon’s” statement that, out of
three or four kinds of coarse fish brought from Eng-
lish rivers to Westralian brooks and reservoirs years
ago, perch was the only breed that flourished, is a
little misleading (B. 31/12/’25). Monger’s Lake, on
the outskirts of Perth, is chockful of worthless
tench, which can be caught by the dozen. Now and
again English people settled in W.A. eat them, but
the use I have seen them put to oftenest is for
manure. An old shellback lugs out basketsful of
the despised fish and plants them round his peach
and pear trees. The fruit is the pride of his suburb.
“Jimmy Possum”: As an antidote to
strychnine poisoning, powdered charcoal is hard to
kpnf When Bluey bolts a bait, hunt round for a
■ . j the f r( , s j ier th e better, finely powder
about a tablespoonful of it and push it down the

“Oscar Meston” : “Deryk Boone” (B.
14/l/’26) examines
Western Queensland
as a climate for con-
sumptives and con-
demns it utterly be-
cause of its extreme
heat, drought and
dust, and the absence
of tempting food
including fruit and
vegetables and
ice. He says the
supremely - important
climatic condition is
clarity of air. If the
factors indicated could
ensure a cure, then
Stanthorpe (Q.), where
the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has spent about
£BO,OOO on a military
sanatorium, would have
no rival. In this little
mountain village, ap-
proximately 3000 ft.
above sea - level,
Queensland girls and
English fruits grow
to perfection, and the
air is of a quality'
which is not popularly
supposed to exist
outside a poet’s imag-
ination. The fruit is
of superlative size and
am b r-o si a 1 flavor.
Vegetables of great
variety and succulence
are grown in abun-
dance, and ice is
manufactured by two
local firms. Surely
these conditions are
ideal for the sufferer!
But, alas! although
the climate is a ;palli-
ative, and, in incipi-
ent cases, a restorative,
it is not a specific,
and the great sad
army’ of the afflicted
still await the medi-
cine-man wh o shall
make them whole
again.

“W.R.”: Though most imported animals
or birds from the Cold Country thrive and multiply
under the warm suns of Australia, the English sky-
lark isn’t one of them. Forty-seven years ago a
few of the birds were liberated at Turkey Point,
near Bibbenluke (N.S.W.), by H. T. Edwards, the
station manager. Every year since then the trillings
of their sky-songs have gladdened the gTafters at
the woolshed on the fiat below; but the choir has
never increased. Many old hands on the station
declare that the original birds are the present
choristers; anyway, no nests built by them have
ever been discovered.
* * * *
“Up Top”: In the N.Q. “season” the gins
have a busy time collecting grass-
seed. The dillybags being full, a hole
about 18in. in diameter and 6ft. deep
is dug, handy to the low leaning
branch of a tree. The seed is then
poured into the hole and a gin steps
in and treads the mass down with
her feet. Seed is continually poured in
while the gin’s tramping feet and
screwing toes separate the seed from
the husk. The seeds keep sinking to
the bottom of the hole, leaving on
top the husks, leaves and small twigs.
The seed is transferred to bark coola-
mons and thrown in the air to be
winnowed by the breeze. It is then
for grinding into flour between
stones. Water is gradually added, and
the resultant paste is scraped into a
bark, trough. It is then cooked as
daipper in the ashes, unless it be a
kind which must first go through
many water washings to dissolve
away any vegetable poison.
* * *
“Shearer”: Referring to a cut-out of sheep
at Gillendoon station, near Warren (N.S.W.), “Pick’’
quotes the price per hundred as 30s. That was the
rate a while ago; the present award rate i 3 38s.
* * * *
“Moreton”: Queensland feels no false
shame about its goats; i|. takes a census of them
every year for the live-stock reports. At the end
of 1924 the grand total was 131,148 common goats
and 3511 angoras. As .the distribution of the
derided animals is frequently a subject of heated
controversy, it may he noted that there are IS
petty-sessions districts with a eaprie population of
over 2000. Ravenswood (10,000) just leads from
Rockhampton (93,33) and Charters Towers (9326).
But these round figures suggest that Ravenswood is
much too sick and tired to bother about an odd
nanny or two.
“Soda” : “Runa’s” snappers weighing 221 b.
and 231 b. (B. 31/12/’25) are not anywhere near records
for Maoriland; in fact, sea-snappers of that size are
caught frequently by shark and sword fishermen with
a 4lb. or 51b. fish bait attached to their gear. Last
season “Windy” Hill landed one in Doubtless Bay
that turned the scale at 291 b. about eight, hours
after it had been caught. The largest on record
in j,f L. was caU gbt with a hand-line, baited with
liver,' from the Oraki wharf in Auckland Harbor
A PARTING SHOT.
SILAS TREGILGAS ( summarily dismissed ): “And ’ow ’bout me
brother —will this affair maake any difference to ’ et”

man’s relations. Lemme see — where’s your brother work-
ing again?”
SILAS : “ ’E’s in South Ammeriky.”
12 years ago. This fish turned the scale at 381 b.
and measured 3ft. 10in., was seven years old, and
its teeth had not lost a point, showing that she—
for it was a female —was on a first visit from deep
water. All . large harbor-snapper have . their teeth
Well worn down from cracking mussels and other
shellbacks. Three years ago, whilst loitering about
in a dinghy off the n.-w. point of Mayer Island, in
the Bay of Plenty, I saw mooching about in the
kelp what appeared to be a large groper, but on
getting a clearer view I saw it to be a huge
snapper. I don't think it could have been an ouuce
less than 651 b.
* * * *
“Sierra”: I doubt if “Bunya” (B.
31/12/’25) has ever seen a wandering albatross
hundreds of miles north of the equator. These
beautiful birds are the largest of
15 species of albatrosses, and are
bred on the Crozets, Tristan da
Cunha, and other islands in the
Southern Hemisphere. To seamen
they are the only albatross; the
smaller species, wherever found, are
merely mollyhawks. Seamen fanci-
fully credit them with being re-
incarnations of old sailors drowned
in southern seas; and the almost
human way in which they appear to
interest themselves in shipboard
movements—s.agely supervising the
reefing of topsails, critically watch-
ing the passing of reef-earrings, and
even peering into the binnacle like
wise old skipper’s —lends color to
this fancy. They accompany ships
for thousands of miles, but rarely
follow them north of 40deg. south.
Many, of the smaller species are
found in northern latitudes, and may
be mistaken for the wanderer. One
species nests on Albatross Island in
Bass Strait —wonderful storehouse of
marine life—and as far as I know
that, is their only breeding ground
in Australia. Penguins are common
to the shores of Australia, South
America, South , Africa and many
southern islands. In Cape Town,
during the season, cooked penguin-
eggs are sold at a shilling a dozen.
“Bilbav”: I once earned my salt-horse
punching a little trading schooner round the Solomon
Islands. On one voyage we had to call at Marovo
Lagoon to load copra, and arrived there early on a
Saturday morning. We couldn’t get any labor, as
all the local lads belong to the mission, which is
run by the Seventh Day Adventists. Saturday is
their Sabbath, and as we wanted to leave that nifiit
there was nothing tor it but to turn out our boats-
crevv of Malayta men to bag up the copra and put
it aboard. All hands got into the boats and every-
thing went well for a couple of hours; then my
engine-boy caine to me and passed this remark in a
tone of deep disgust: “This Japarandi [the local name
for Seventh Day Adventists] business good-feller too
much. To-day Sunday belong mission; to-morrow
Sunday belong Jesus. Two-feller Sunday along one
week. Boy belong schooner, must he work every
day?” I managed to appease him; but he plainly
was still of opinion that there was something wrong
somewhere.
* * * * ,
“Hamer”: The newest imported pest is
the bul-bul, the Persian nightingale. The charges
against the little alien range from insufficient means
of support without attacking fruit and valuable seeds
to the deliberate murder of young Australians such
as the progeny of the pretty “blue bonnet” wren.
The verdict of a jury of naturalists is that all charges
are proved, and their sentence is that a war of exter-
mination should be waged upon the intruder before
he becomes too numerous. But pests flourish so
singularly well in Australia that, though the first
pair of bul-buls were released only a few years ago,
extermination now will prove a very difficult job.
* * * *
“E.A.Iv.”: In certain parts of the Mur-
chison (W.A.) there are a number of soaks which
fill up during the night only and apparently from
some hidden spring. The supply varies according to
the phases of the moon. Can any Abo. explain?
* * * *
“Gomaoho”: How is this for the most
peculiar treatment for otitis? When a Vailala
native (Papua) is suffering he captures a small brown
beetle, half an inch long and flat, and introduces
it into the external auditory canal of the aching
ear. After devouring any discharge from the wax-
glands or any pus from an abscess, the beetle backs
out, and, crossing the patient’s neck, enters his other
ear. When the job is ended, the beetle crawls off
into the jungle. Out of work, it inhabits the stem
of the sago-palm. Is this treatment mentioned in
the pharmacopoeia compiled by any other nigger com-
munity ?
» * * *
“Essby”: Twelve months ago we sold a
three-year-old cattle-dog to a friend living some five
miles away. Do what we may, we cannot persuade
him to remain with his purchaser. Can any Abo.
reader tell us how to do so?
* * * *
“Hotham”: A Victorian resident recently
stowed away £2O in notes behind a loose brick in
his house at Nagain (Vic.). Next time he visited
the hoard some of the notes had gone. Investigations
revealed a rat’s family behind the wall, cradled in
chewed-up bank-notes. It looked a dead loss until
the amateur banker discovered that the nest-makers
had carefully preserved the numbers of the stolen
notes, which included two fivers, intact. The Com-
monwealth Bank has now pftid out on the fragments.
* * # *
“Te W.”: I recently saw a rainbow trout
taken from fairly deep water in the Bega River
(N.S.W.) at a spot below its junction with the
Brogo and within the extreme tidal limits. This
aristocratic fish —-greenish-blue in general coloring,
with silvery, irridescent sides dotted thickly with
small black spots—is supposed to be unable to exist
except in cold and swiftly-running streams, and the
Bega River at the part indicated is not such a
stream. Years ago I heard tales of alleged trout
being found caught in wire-netting fences after
floods in the Bega and Brogo Rivers, but the pedi-
srrocis of these derelicts were never accurately ascer-
tained.
A FELLOW FEELING.
THE RECTOR'S WIFE : “Kindly ask those hoys not to make
so much noise—the rector has a shocking headache
this morning.”
HER DREADFUL NEIGHBOR: “Certingly, ma’am; it’s me
that kin sympathise with yer. Me ’usbing's just
the same after his night out.”
“A.8.W.” : Melbourne Zoo’s baby hippo, is
now a bud in heaven —pneumonia sent him there the
other day. Incidentally, the hippo, born in Mel-
bourne Zoo three or four years ago was sold to u
sister institution for something like £2SO. There
is a scarcity of the huge amphibia in the worlds
zoos nowadays.
WET AND DRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a hoodoo here on the Lignum shed, tor this
is the third week’s “wet” ;
And none of the swanky shearing team have cut
off their exes. yet.
The flannelled swells are tame as nets and down
to their last few bob;
And'big Le Bran with the yard-broom mo is looking
less of a nob.
While the sheep stay “wet,” and the grub runs up,
a mug Chow’s “broken the school,”
And a shiela robbed him the first night out in a
bug-house in Girrule.
Tiie shearers have their “babbler” set —lie’s feeding
them now on hash.
The union rep. is the only one of the “snaggers”
up to cash.
What cares the cook if it don’t fine up? It’s he
who’ll ring the shed.
We’ve read the books on the station through and
rain’s still overhead.
The shabby pack-horse bagmen sneer, who pass on
their shoddy crocks,
And the “gun” who “rung” till the wet set in has
auctioned his fiashest socks.
Oh, never a team was half so mad as the wool-hogs
in their bunks!
In each one’s room you can feel the gloom and
throw it about in chunks.
The pressmen swear that the cross-eyed bum who
fed at the shearers’ mess
Stalked througli the shed to dodge the boss and looked
at the blasted press.
But what is biting the shearer most —far more than
the sodden sky—
The common rousies are swanking up to their “pay
for wet and dry!”

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOES
_ Since Pauline Curran, of Tasmania, mar-
ried her Prince every social butterfly has in
her dreams been trying the weight of a
coronet. The latest bachelor Earl to drop
into Sydney is the young gentleman who for
amateur theatrical purposes takes the name
of Otis B, Sutro, His real name is Charles
Henry George Howard, and he is twentieth
Earl of Suffolk and thirteenth of Berkshire.
On the voyage from London to Maoriland he
organised a variety show for the passengers
df the Ruahine and gave imitations of Laddie
Cliff, also taking part in a comic ballet and
designing the dances and costumes. He is
20, owns an English estate of 10,000 acres
with a historic picture-gallery, and is fond
of travel. Two years ago he had a glimpse
of the Harbor City when on a round-the-
world cruise in the sailing-ship Mount
Stewart. And Potts Point remembers that f
because some practical joker passed himself
off in that once gilt-edged neighborhood for
a glorious crowded hour or two as the dinkum
Earl. His former skipper now has a farm,
and thither the dark-moustached, pale young
man goes after his few days at the Australia.
There’s quite a bit of Japan in Port
.Jackson this week. First of all came the
Ingli-masted Taisei Maru, which is a train-
ing ground for the merchant marine; then,
before half of the city was awake on Satur-
day morning, the Iwate flashed her smile on
Sydney. By the time the 21st gun had
Doomed, the sleepers-out along the harbor
front were wide enough awake to eye the
sturdy if somewhat old-fashioned cruiser as
she picked up her moorings in Farm Cove
On Sunday the city had a more intimate
glimpse into her domestic arrangements,
when the laundry of the entire ship’s com-
pany was pegged aloft, there to brood
moodily in the sweltering heat all day long.
Hundreds, of course, raked the ship from
io cs le to quarter-deck during Sunday after-
an<? so P°^ e were the hosts that,
although it was a public inspection, they pro-
vided tea for their guests. They also per-
formed wonders of wrestling, jiu-jitsu and
that fencing with the wooden sabres which
looks like comedy, but must be strenuous
enough, judging by the armor the opponents
wear. Padded leather breastplates, leather
gloves, padded helmets and a twisted wicker
visor, plus (for some unknown reason) long
navy-blue skirts slit at each side, form the
equipment, and the sounds of the fray strike
wild and savage on the Sydney ear. Two
pommies ’ among the crowd on Sunday were
discussing the spick-and-span Commander.
“Davey,” mused one, “isn’t it a queer name
to call a man—Yuriichi?” “Perhaps the
mos-skeeters were uncommon bad the summer
he was christened,” proffered the sombre
Gave, making another ineffective reach to-
wards the bites under his own collar-band.
On Saturday the Taisei Maru was all
decked out for a party, and Captain Asari,
Ins officers and cadets were at home. The
decks of the boat (where, by the way, all
the nautical terms used arc English and the
log is written in the same language) were
gay with garlands of flowers and miles of
red, green and yellow T streamers, while here
and there ruby-red glass-bells tinkled and
jangled m the breeze. The hosts, in their im-
peccable white uniforms, did the honors in
fine style, and a Japanese orchestra—it was
composed of bamboo stringed-instruments
and one violin—played to our uncultured ear
the music that stirs Japan even as the great
national jazz stirs America.
Barbara Bowker’s marriage to Alan
Graeme Potter was the social flurry of last
week, and along the pews of St. Mark’s ran
a purr of satisfaction with the fashionables
gathered to watch the give-and-take. Bar-
bara made her entry on father’s arm look-
ing like some delicate pencil-sketch in the
fluent lines of her ivory chiffons. These were
modelled into a tight bodice that billowed
into a skirt full and wide and of almost
ankle length, and both were embroidered in
a lace-like tracery of silver thread and seed
pearls. The skirt ended in a deep trans-
parent hem. The train, a frothy thing of
tulle, fell from flic shoulders and was out-
lined in silver thread and pearls. The veil
was of point de gaze, and had been worn by
Mrs. Steer Bowker. A string of pearls
wrenched by the bridegroom from the very
jaws of the oyster was the final dress
hosanna. The Granville Ryrie twins, Mar-
jorie and Gwendoline, ’maided in embroidered
ivory chiffons topped by apple-green taffeta
hats; and the bride’s little nieces Beatrice
and Philippa Gordon, daughters of the Jim
Gordons of Werriwa, had their heads bound
with green wreaths and were otherwise
creamy puffs. The church decorations struck
an unusual note in the boxes of growing pink
tiger-lilies- and gladioli placed along the
chancel, wdiile tall silver wands dripped pink
and red roses in between. Jim Dickson
bestmanned and Dick Allen was groomsman.
The Steer Bowker home at Edgecliff, with
the help of a marquee, housed the party,
when Mrs. Bowker’s swathings of black geor-
gette with toolings of palest rose pink satin
and trails of diamente gathered the applause
of many eyes,
'The chapel of Wesley College -within the
Lni. was a marriage smithy the other day.
Ernest Cull, of Ashfielcg was the man who
lured his bride, Dr. Frances Mabel Brett,
from the same suburb, to its altar, and he
takes a particular interest in the chapel be-
cause his father gave it to the college. Dr.
Prescott, of Newington College, acted as
locksmith, and the jbride’s sister Alice and
the groom’s sister Isabel ’maided in tones
of gold. The principal lady assembled the
traditional splendor of ivory satin and orange
blossom. A wedding luncheon at Marana,
the bride’s home, rounded off the ceremony.
St. James’s was chosen by Marjorie Rol-
leston Pyke, of Dalbeatty, Coolamon, for
her wedding with Captain F. A. Innes,
of Tasmania, marine superintendent of the
Commonwealth Line. The bride, who was
.squired to the altar by father, wore with her
ivory crepe de Chine a shady white crino-
line hat swathed with white velvet. The
Australia served the wedding luncheon.
r The quiet little church of St. Michael’s, at
Vaueluse, harbored a w-edding on Saturday
afternoon. The bride was Mrs. K. B. Wills-
alien, a daughter of the late Gidiey King
of Goonoo Goonoo, and the ’groom Leonard
Pavitt, of Queensland and formerly of Lon-
don. The bride’s brother, George Macarthur
King, handed her over, Archdeacon D’Arey
Irvine made a neat job of the welding, and
John Martin best-manned. The Leslie
Willsallens entertained the mauve-chiffoned
bride, her new husband and a group of
family friends at Cairnton, their Bellevue
Hill home.
Last Saturday Lebby Hordern, youngest
of the Brickfield Hill family, took his
second plunge into matrimony. His first
wife (she was a Monie) and he were divorced
last year. Plis new bride is Frances Barry,
a daughter of G. J. Barry, of the law- firm of
Barry and Norris. Actor Roger is one of her
brothers, and Mrs. Macdonald, with whom
she has been staying in Europe, is her only
sister. She inherits the family good looks.
Once in a moment of revelation a great
actor’s wife w-rote: “This is the life of little
me: I am the
wife of Beer-
bolim T r e e.”
But this state
of mind can
n e v e r sub-
merge the smil-
ing lady in the
picture along-
side. She is the
wife of Edge-
worth David,
Professor and
Knight, Aus-
tralian geolo-
gist and Polar
explorer, but
she is herself
a great scholar,
too. For many
years one of the
forces behind
women’s edu-
cational an d
other move-
meats in Australia, her energies now are
concentrated on baby welfare. She is presi-
dent of the newly-formed Australian Mother-
craft Society, and is working hard to make
the drive in aid of Karitane, the head-
quarters at Coogee, the success of the year.
The drive starts with a linen-tea at Karitane
on. the 13th.
Husbands are a marine product all right;
and it seems that no amount of gold braid
can save a sea-urchin from being potted by
Cupid. Which mixed remark leads up to the
fact that the commander of the Aoraugi, Cap-
tain Crawford, is coyly announcing his en-
gagement to Mrs. E. F. Can-, of Keanah
Flats, McMahon’s Point. The lady is the
widow of the late J. E. C. Carr.
When Henry Gullett commissioned Bert-
ram Mackennal to design a statuary group
that should leaven the badness of the majo-
rity of Sydney’s pedestailed images he pitffed
the right sculptor and a congenial subject.
The Shakspeare group outside the Mitchell
Library, whether an original or, as some
say, a replica, is a masterpiece, and the plac-
ing of it within coo-ee of the Captain Phillip
and John Robertson effigies emphasises its
grace and beauty. The immortal William
stands aloft, pen in hand, evidently about
to write a sonnet on the harbor, of which
he has a good view. At his feet are grouped
Romeo and Juliet, who ask no more of life
than each other’s society; Hamlet in a
calmer moment; Portia, getting the jury in
a fit state of mind to lynch the Jew; and
last, but not least, stout old Falstaff, sword
at a jaunty angle, peering round the corner
into Hunter street, where lies the nearest
tavern, and catching a glimpse at the same
time of an ankle as trim as Mistress Ford’s.
Their heads were all wrapped in burlap
when this Letter saw them, but even the toes
of Mackennal’s figures are expressive.
Still another aspirant for Australia’s poet
laureatesliip! He is Harry Green, and his
job is to keep the Wisher Library at
the University abreast with modern thought
in every de-
gree of latitude
and longitude.
But in his
spare time he
puts on paper
the dreams and
thoughts of the
poet. Bast
year Mr. Green
published his
first book of
verse, and
named it “The
Happy Val-
ley.” Many of
the poems had
already ap-
peared in The
Bulletin, but
between covers
they seemed to
have added to
their frag-
rance—just as
the massed roses in a potpourri are more potent
than a single bloom, Mr, Green has his B.A.
degree and has been admitted to the Bar, but
he prefers sonnets to briefs and would rather
walk with poesy than justice—at least the
justice of the law courts. Some years ago
he w T as one of the brilliant young men of the
Sydney Telegraph. May Moore took the
picture. '
Dignified Commodore Wardle, who main-
tains the traditions of the Silent Service by
never breathing a superfluous syllable, has
taken the R.A.N. fleet to Jervis Bay. After
the, annual gunnery practice, which marks the
fall of the early peach leaf, they will pass
on to Tasmania. Daughter Jean, Dad’s
right hand on the social plane, has gone
ahead of the ships to Hobart. The slender
lass has filled the part of Commodore’s lady
with the tact of a feminine Wallington. In
April or thereabouts the first Australian
bluejacket to take over “everything afloat”
in these waters, Captain Hyde, will be the
hero of Sydney ballrooms.
Mary Hinton’s frocking in “The Pelican”
brings out more of the charm of figure and
coloring w r e associate with Mrs. Pitt Rivers
than did the lady’s dressing in “Beaucaire.”
Her first appearance as the divorcee is made
in that most dangerous of combinations,
black and white. This is a two-piece made
on straight lines and worn with a felt and
velvet hat in the same tones. A travelling
coat and hat in green over a bois-de-rose
sports suit sustains her through the second
act; while in the third she soothes her
aching heart with the vibrations from a
dinner frock of royal blue georgette em-
bossed with velvet in turquoise tones.
“Who’s to be Queen of the May?” asks the
Hospital Saturday Fund, and proceeds to
hang the hawthorn with glittering baubles
for her who can gather the largest number
of subjects before May 1. Every firm, de-
partment, office, factory, association or sub-
urb is entitled to set up a candidate, and
already 50 nominations have been received.
Aspiring queens must adopt English his-
torical costumes —these will be lent by the
Buttonhole and the Mascotte costume com-
panies—and photographs are being taken by
Elizabeth Mahoney, of Richmond House,
Castlereagh-street. Among the Queen’s
prizes are the Rickard Cup, of solid silver—
it can be used as a rose- or fruit-bowl or a
bath for the baby—and a trip to Kosciusko;
a diamond ring and a trip to Jenolan Caves
will go to the two runners-up. Mrs. Mac-
lurean is giving the freedom of the Went-
worth to the best-costumed queen and a
party of 10 friends, in addition to handing
over £25 on her behalf to the Hospital Satur-
day Fund.
No Eton crop for the American girl. She
wears her bob long enough to be picturesque
and to show 7 to the full advantage the per-
manent wave that poor and rich alike have
renovated every six months. So says Grif-
fen Foley’s young widow, who is just back
from New York after nearly 12 months’
study of polar fashions. The Ogilvie sis-
ters flung wide the deepest secrets of their
famous rooms to the Australian; indeed,
everybody, from the greatest tonsorial artist
dowm, helped her. The attendants in U.S.A.
hairdressing rooms don’t all stand while
barbering the locks of Eve and Adam.
They perch on stools high, low or medium
while running the shears over their clients;
and thus they retain their early-morning
vigor and enthusiasm for the end-of-the-day
customer. For clothes just as good at half
the price you go to the funny barn-like
stores, where you fossick around among the
dress models till you find your own size.
Then you pluck a handful and try them on
in one of the little cubicles, make your
choice, and hancl it in to be packed up, ail
without the slightest help from the shop
assistant. The address of these eafetaria
places doesn’t command the respect of a
Fifth-avenue establishment, but only a
clothes hound could discover the difference
in the goods.
Died at Manly last week, Mrs. Mackellar,
president of the Oilgandra branch of the
Country Women’s Association. Mrs Mae-
kellar was one of the earliest members of
the association, and for the last two years
had been on the executive.
A fashionable portrait-painter had painted
a star (male) of the moment. It was not
a commission, and the actor was, of course,
not paying a ha’penny. But that -did not
prevent his asking for the portrait. The
artist, knowing he could sell the portrait
for close on a thousand, demurred, but
offered to copy of the original and
give it to the dStor. He made the copy, had
it framed, and sent the framer’s bill to the
actor. The actor kept the portrait and the
frame, but returned the bill to the artist.
Marie Narelle is starting off on a tour of
the South Coast to give friends of 15 and
20 years ago a chance to hear her again
in the songs of old Ireland, The singer,
who retujns to America in a. few months’
time, has just completed a concert season
on the Northern Rivers. Here, in spite
of floods and storms, her old enthusiasts
rallied around- —in one case an elderly farmer
and his wife arrived on draught-horses, that
being their only means of crossing a flooded
creek.
Mrs. J. A. Wilson, whose chief delight is
to gather poor kiddies by the hundred and
take them for a day’s sunshine on the beach,
was herself given a party the other day.
This wasn’t a pienie, though; it was a lunch-
party at the Australia, with Mayor Stokes
presiding. The tables were beautiful with soft,
feathery, pink cactus-dahlias, and in front of
Mrs. Wilson glow r ed a basket of roses and
pansies. May Matthews, Mrs. Trefle and
ardent Red-Crosser Rose Piper were a few 7
who heaped tributes on the generous-hearted
guest; and George Fitzpatrick and Town
Clerk Layton supplied a polished bit of
word-work to the afternoon’s parquetry.
Over a hundred voices cheered Mrs. Wilson
when a laurel wreath and a gold chain-bag
were passed over to her keeping. \
Jack D. Taylor, of Auckland Downs
(N.Q.), returned to Australia by the Niagara
looking well after an illness in Egypt that
bit a piece out of his 12 months’ round-the-
world tour. He is cooling off at his home
at Wollstonecraft before going north in the
autumn.
Miss Brisbane’s chronicle :
Mrs. Dcshon hostessed a tea at the Botanic Gardens
kiosk for Lorrie King, who is to be married this
week. The hostess wore black and royal blue, the
guest of honor all white. There was a big roll-up.
John Cockburn, of New Farm, mourns his wife, who
died in Sydney. Betty Cockburn, her daughter, now
Mrs. Tom Leitch, Mosman, was a well known Bris-
bane singer. Mrs. Cockburn met with what was
thought to be a trifling accident at Yeddo, her New
l 1 arm home, six months ago, and never recovered.
Pink and lavender made the color scheme at St.
Agatha’s, Clayfield, for the marriage of A. D. Daly,
grandson of the late Major Mellish, to Jessie Mooney.
Father McKenna and Father O’Connell tied the
knot, and the bride wore white chiffon and Paris
lace. Mrs. T. R. McKenna gave the reception at
Naomi, Ascot. Tire Northern Rivers reflect the
honeymoon.
Lottie Richter, with her pupils, took part in a
complimentary recital for singer Rene Marsden, who
is going to the N.S.W. Conservatorium. There was
a good gathering in the School of Arts Hall and
many bouquets, floral and verbal, for the departing
singer.
Jean Cramond was tea-ed at the Q.N. Bank, Too-
woomba, before her wedding bells rang, in a perfect
garden of blue hydrangeas, coreopsis, dahlias and
tall lilies.
Lady Marjorie Dalrymple has been talking to
gioups of women about the Girl Guide movement.
Mrs. E. H. Macartney, w r ho did the welcoming, said
she believed there would be a roll-call of 600,000
girl guides when the annual report was next pub-
lished.
St. Andrew’s Church was dressed up with roses and
zinnias for the marriage of Marcia Whittaker, of
Milton station, to William Dawes, of Dalby. The
pretty dark bride wore shell pink with a pink veil
and carried a bunch of roses. Margaret Haymeii,
in maize with a blue hat, was one of the maids, and
Dorothy Dawes, in daffodil, the other. They carried
yellow roses. Judith Roe, in ivory, was a wee
attendant. Dixon Daws best-manned and Ross Nichol-
son groomsmanned. The Ha.vmens gave the party,
amidst pink roses, at Indooroopilly.
The man who told this postscript about the new
teaching order which has set itself up in Rock-
hampton, the Oratory of the Good Shepherd
(21/l/’26), knew less about it than he ought to have
known. It is an Anglican order; the first contingent
to arrive in Queensland numbers eight—four of
them lay members—and they are all from England.

Our hills have been pillars of smoke by
day and of fire by night. Ilealesville had a
narrow squeak, the flames trailing very near
the picturesque golf-house before they were
beaten back. The same thing happened once
before, according to tradition, when a male
golfer fired the herbage to find a lost ball.
At dawn next day a band of wearied fire-
fighters got the flames under control, but no
one seems to know if the economical sport
recovered his ball. Lilydale, that pretty
little village with a rose-embowered bowling-
green right in the middle of the main street,
lias been within range of the bush blaze,
but "has hitherto escaped.
The drought of social events is breaking.
The autumn race-season is at hand, polo and
attendant festivities loom large, theatres are
busy making ready for changes,, the musical
fraternity is tuning its sharps and flats, and
several fashionable weddings are toward. The
discovery that the best seats for Pavlova
are to cost but a guinea plus tax, notwith-
standing the rebuilding of the stage, has
occasioned joy. Lots of people have been
saving much more than that, for March 13,
when the lady pirouettes into His Majesty’s
with her Russian ballet.
Recently an. over-seas fashion-writer —
possibly a red-lieaded she —announced that
winter abroad had brought forth day-time
apparel of green in rich dark shades, and
that the dainty hues of the leaf of early
spring were favored for evening frocks.
Instantly Melbourne shops and warehouses
were besieged for the color, and a regular
boom demand Was been created for the
verdant tones. It would seem that authori-
tative permission to wear green has been
long awaited by thousands of simple souls
who know it suits ’em, but couldn’t wear
it when it was “out.” Though great summer
sales continue, winter coats and wraps appear
in the windows of several emporiums. One
firm has delightful bottle-green coats, flared
of skirt and collared and cuffed with fitch
or other brown fur. So the forecast from
abroad seems to have some foundation.
The coming season evidently is to find us
clad in the color sported by our first
parents, though in. garb more sophisticated
than Eden could afford.
There were no thrills about the exhibition
tennis games at the Albert Ground. Even
the singles contest of J. O. Anderson and
the fleshly Gerald Patterson was a half-
hearted affair. The sun was fierce and flies
disgustingly adhesive, though a tempering
breeze made existence tolerable for the gal-
lery of enthuiasts, whose parasols formed a
canopy of cerise, orange, blue and green, with
patches of cubist and floral inventions. Nor-
man Brookes’s lady on the first day was in
the newest of sports suits, a jumper attached
to much accordeon-pleating of lilac tone. Mrs.
R. R. Harper wore a black hat and plaid
silk apparel in hues of fawn, black and pink ;
champion Esna Boyd sported cool looking rai-
ment of apple-green silk crepe with a touch
of gold, and a biscuit crinoline headpiece.
Gerald Patterson’s wife was a study in pink
—with more pink roses resting upon wide-
leafed millinery.
When Elmer Pauly, the U.S. Trade Com-
missioner, and his lady gathered their friends
at the Oriental for a farewell dish of tea
they discovered that their three-years’
sojourn had added considerably to their army
of friends, some 300 mustering in the dining-
room of the popular rendezvous, where yellow
blossoms brooded o’er the damask and a
string orchestra orked. The hostess, who
has a flair for the picturesque in apparel,
tied a tuscan straw hat with pink roses and
blue ribbon upon her’ shingled head above
a frock of delphinium blue, gold-embroidered.
’Murka’s Consul, Norman Anderson, and his
spouse, the latter a study in grey with a
dash of red, were of the guests, along with
a whole raft of other consuls and their well-
groomed women-folk. Mrs. W. A. Watt
graced the party in black with relief in violct-
and-gold trimming. Many members of the
English-Speaking Union were sprinkled
round the tables, and Jean and Bruce Pauly
were with poppa and momma to say their
good-byes.
Mayor Bruuton and his lady are still listen-
ing to congratulations and collecting memen-
toes of the entry in the New Year’s honors
list that gives the family a place in Burke
and Whitaker. The most notable recent
occasion was when the supporters of the
Carlton crSche mustered at the Windsor to
drink tea in honor of their foundation
vice-president. Tali baskets scattered
pink rose-petals and hydrangea upon
the tables. Dorothy Humphries raised
her voice in song, Mrs. Jackman
gave monologues, and Ethel Croker, at
the piano, helped along the rejoicings. The
leading civic lady, who wore beige lace inter-
mingling with black crepe de Chine and a
black ribbon-trimmed hat, accepted some
water-lilies in a cut-glass bowl from her
fellow-workers, along with a sheaf of good
wishes.
The much-looked-forward-to cabaret enter-
tainment organised by the Tallis lady and
June Elvidge to help St. Vincent’s duly
happened at the Oriental, wdiere host Perrin
and Mrs. Perrin lent invaluable aid. Although
the big dining-room, a marquee adjoining the
Georgian room and the lounge had the cloths
spread for supper, lots of patrons had to be
content to stand; and not until 2 o’clock
could the one-step be indulged in with com-
fort in any of the three jazzeries. A pro-
gramme arranged by Walter Kirby provided
work for the tenor and several other wyell-
known songbirds; also by Carrie Haase, who,
in frock of old-gold Florentine brocade and
amber necklace, spoke the prologue of
Flecker’s “Hassan.” The after-the-theatre
cabaret turns with spotlight effects were
worth seeing, the full “Aladdin” orchestra
turning up to accompany the soloists and bal-
lets from the panto. Melbourne has never
had a more wonderful early-morning party,
and as General Blarney blessed the proceed-
ings with his presence, the most delicate con-
sciences knew no twinge. Among the enter-
tainers was Jennie Benson, in amethyst
velvet frock flared with grey fur and silver
embossed. Claude Flemming and George
Barraud, in costume, duetted those affecting
ditties, “Two Little Girls in Blue” and “I
Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard.” Marie
La Varre and Gus Bluett combined talents;
Maie Baird and Archie Thompson danced;
and Dorothy Dewar, a shapely panto, boy,
had the ballet’s support. Rupert Hazel re-
cited an ode to St. Vincent’s ministering
angels, and the Three Karreys, Bruce Green
and John Ralston helped to keep the hall
rolling. The Tallis lady wore a gown of
gold lace with bead embroidery; June
Elvidge, who, with Jennie Benson, ran an
American bar, had gold sequins sprinkled
upon an orange-hued frock. Renee Kelly
(who off stage uses a lorgnette) turned shop-
keeper and sdld novelties and balloons. His
Ex. was represented by his son and heir
and daughter Helena, she in a leaf-green
gown that sparkled with diamente.
The bright smile pictured here by Lafay-
ette expresses the delight of Dr. Marjorie
Hughes at the
prospect of a
life on the
ocean wave.
She has signed
on as a ship's
doctor, a thing
that has not
been done by
a Melbourne
girl since Dr.
Ethel Cowan
shipped on the
Yarrawoliga in
’9B. For three
y ears Dr.
Hughes’s
brass-plate has
adorned the
family home at
Els ternwick.
She is a mem-
ber of the
honorary staffs
of the Alfred, Children’s and Queen Victoria
Memorial hospitals. The opportunity to
travel happened through the captain of the
Swedish motor-ship Yngaren having a sick
wife aboard. Dr. Hughes’s sister, a trainee
on the nursing staff of Melbourne Hospital,
was asked to go along, but not being certi-
ficated she had to refuse, and the offer was
extended to her sister, who jumped at the
chance, hurriedly bundled a stethoscope and
a few garments together, and was off within
two days for Gothenburg. She intends to
sojourn awhile in Baldwinland to get further
hospital experience and higher degrees.
A party of “Rover” scouts (it is the ambi-
tion of every “Cub” to be a “Rover” some
day) had to put their training to a test
during the bush-fire epidemic. They were
holding a corroboree at Gembrook, when the
fires suddenly became serious ; presently they
found their retreat across the creek cut off
by a burnt bridge. Thereupon a section of
the boys, who had often made bridges for
scouting practice, built one in dead earnest —
out of boughs and anything else that came
to hand—while the other section fought a
rearguard action against the flames. The
job took four hours; and the call was so
close that four of the boys collapsed and the
scoutmaster was badly burnt.
Society, summering selectly at Macedon,
has devoted some of its time to good w T orks.
The Hodges lady lent her Dreamthorpe gar-
den for a fete in aid of the Gisborne C. of
E. vicarage fund, and the Grice dame spoke
the opening piece. The helpers and sellers
included the Robert Knox pair, Mrs. George
Landale, Mrs. Ross-Watt and many others.
When members of the Friendly Union
of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers rallied round
for their first corroboree of the year at the
Oddfellows’ Hall there was music to cairn
the soul and tea and cakes to comfort the
body. Mrs. Selheim took the chair. Mrs.
R. L. Corney, of the council, just home from
Europe, was welcomed back into the fold,
and in exchange handed on greetings from
Lady Novar, with whom she spent a couple
of days, and gave an account of her own
wanderings. At the March meeting the
union will bid Lady Stradbroke farewell.
Members of the Broadmeadows Welfare
Committee assembled at Scott’s to give their
vice-president, Mrs. T. M. Burke, a cup of
tea before the family’s departure for Europe.
Mrs. Benjamin Hoare, as president of the
charity dispensers, handed over a morocco-
leather travelling-bag full of the good wishes
of members.
Most politicians admit that their wives
have helped them right nobly in the fray.
J. G. Latham,
the new Fed-
eral Attoimey-
General, had
the aid of the
lady here pic-
t: ured by
Lafayette in
pensive pose.
Mrs. Latham
is a B.A. of
Melbourne
University, and
is president of
the Lyceum
Club. Outside
her home and
family her in-
terest is
wrapped up in
the comfort
and welfare of
the small
patients in the
Children’s Hospital.
Dr. Margaret McLorinan’s tea-party in
honor of Dr. Clara Stone on the eve of that
lady’s departure for Europe, was attended hy
the Mayoress, the committee of Victoria Hos-
pital, a few outsiders and many women
doctors. The bonnie looking hostess wore
pale grey silk voile with a floral line in black,
small black crinoline millinery, and a posy
of pink carnations. Her benedictions upon
the parting guests were echoed by our
leading civic lady, whose cocoa-toned frock
had tracery of lovely lace, and Mrs. John
.Sutherland, honorary secretary of the Q.V.11.
Dr. Stone, in coat-frock of black with orien-
tal trimming and a black-and-gold feather
in her hat, returned thanks, and then spoke
in . praise of Dr. Lilian Alexander, who had
done so much to open the doors of the Medi- -
cal School to women students. The tea-
drinkers included Dr. Brouwen Jones, only
child of Dr. Clara Stone’s sister, Dr. Con-
stance (she married Dr. Egryu Jones), who
will look after auntie’s practice during her
holiday.
Apropos this dreadful habit of souvenir-
hunting, of which there was so much at the
opening of the Federal Parliament. Not
long ago a returning globe-trotter of con-
siderable social tonnage was descending the
gangway of a P. and O. liner when an under-
skirt was seen to have broken away. Real-
ising that the situation could not be saved,
the lady gave a wriggle, let the garment
drop to her feet, and proceeded on her way.
The officer on watch stepped down and
gathered in one of the company’s damask
table-cloths.
It is Geelong’s proud destiny, it would
seem, to find a place on the J.C.W. circuit,
since a company headed by John Tait is to
build a new theatre there. Soon Lizzies
from the local H.F. works will nightly rub
mudguards with Rolls Royces before the Am-
bassadors, a dance palais that is being erected
as part of the movement towards a gayer
Geelong. The Taits already own a big block
of shops in the thriving city, and evidently
they have faith in its future.
Mrs. Norman Brookes will next month
collect her tennis-loving husband and set off
for America. They would have gone earlier
but for the illness of her father, Harry
Emmerton. He and Mrs. Emmerton will
join daughter Mabel and her husband for
the American trip, which will include more
than a casual look-in at the cities.
A holiday like a chapter out of the Arabian
Nights has been enjoyed by Sister Evelyn
Smith, w r ho runs Alandale Nursing Home
at Hawthorn. Scooping Sister Ivy from
under the family roof-tree at Adelaide, they
sailed to India and trekked from end to end,
arriving home after doing 23,000 miles and
riding on everything from an elephant to a
bullock-waggon at different stages of the
journey.
Mrs. R. Wild, in the apparel of the oper-
atic Carmen, and her husband, as a white
pierrot, welcomed a throng of fantastically-
clad revellers at the Austral Salon. Decora-
tions of butterflies, Chinese lanterns and
greenery provided the right sort of setting.
l.)r. Fleming Dunstan brought his dainty
wife in the garb of the colleen of tradition;
Alice Richardson, the Salon’s secretary, was
“Smilin’ Through” in a pink frock; and
Miss E. Billinghurst wore the' brocade and
other patches of Dady Teazle.
A full muster of members of the Quarterly
Club met at the Cafe Julian to say good-bye
to Alice Henry, who turns her barque once
more towards America, and to hear Muriel
Heagney tell the story of her travels. Miss
Henry pleaded for the conservation of Aus-
tralia’s marvellous variety of native plants,
birds and animals. The most horrible de-
struction was going on, and she noted during
her few years aw r ay that much had passed
out of existence. Muriel Heagney’s lively
recital of European experiences included an
account of how she was commanded to get
out of a street at Cologne because the British
General was about to step into his motor-
car—a sort of inverted parallel of the ride
of Lady Godiva.
Sculptor Ola Colin and sister Ziska, whose
forte is landscape gardening, have decided to
find out how much Europe can teach them.
Ziska rejoices in a brand-new diploma from
Burnley Horticultural College, and she plots
to add town-planning and surveying to her
accomplishments before she sees the Yarra
again. The clever maidens are Bendigo
Cohns.
A line from over the ditch :
Before waving farewell to the Apple Isle, where
he has made his home since his marriage to artist
Theo Barclay some years ago, John Eldershaw, the
Sydney water-colorist, has held a very successful show
at Hadley’s—his last before setting sail for the Old
World, where he intends to climb a few more rungs
of the ladder. Several mainland artists, among them
Lionel Lindsay, will be fellow pilgrims.
A note from London: —
The Hon. Peggy Coventry, daughter of Lord Deer-
hurst, who was married at St. Margaret’s, Westminster,
to Eustace Hoare, of Chelsworth Hall, on December
12, offered double defiance to superstition by wearing
a green wrap and selecting a Friday for the cere-
mony. Lord Deerhurst was the principal actor in
a. sensational Melbourne scene, he and Bob Sevier
coming to blows in the old National Hotel over a
very pretty girl whose family were the then pro-
prietors of that sporting hostelry. A sister of the
noble lord caused another sensation by marrying
Prince Victor Dhuleep Sing-h. She was present at
her niece’s marriage, which was attended by a
great array of the peerage.
Miss Adelaide gets in a few words: —
Mrs. Napier Birks, just back from Europe, is satis-
fied that Australia is as far advanced in child-welfare
work as any country. Few Australians are better
entitled to an opinion. A staunch supporter of ail
child-welfare work here, she was asked by the Gov-
ernment to represent South Aus. at the “Save the
Children” congress in Geneva, but arrived to find it
over. However, she ran individual delegates to
‘earth to discover what their respective countries
were doing, and gave an address on local methods
which impressed 200 or so of them with our up-to-
dateness.
Mrs. Ernest Tolley and daughter Maxime (an
amateur dancer who out-'steps a good many pro-
fessionals) are off to Fogland, and have sold their
home at Norwood to the übiquitous Vincent Zed.
Polo players are busy putting a final polish or.
their game for the Australasian and Stradbroke Cup
matches —slightly hampered by heat and continued
dryness that makes their practice grounds dust-
heaps, and, in the country, by bush fires that appear
in the middle of exciting chukkas and demand
immediate attention. S. H. Ayers is to manage the
inter-State team.
Amongst South Australians who have made good
overseas is Constantia Wick steed, who for years has
run one of the best-known finishing schools in Paris.
The French Government has bestowed the Palmes
Academiques upon her for helping to preserve the
entente. One of her pupils at the moment is a
daughter of Gerald du Maurier.
Tennis enthusiasts are pluming themselves on the
cash results of the tournaments, the “gate” beating
Melbourne by over £2OO and Sydney by over £5O,
and that in spite of the elimination of Anderson and
Patterson before the final round. The sun beat piti-
lessly on the unshaded stands, and the low-cut
chemise garment and shingled hair of this genera-
tion give it full play to do its worst —which it did.
Of our younger women players, Miss Hamilton w'as
outstanding. To knack she adds determination and
enthusiasm, and older players gave her many an
approving glance. The A. J. Roberts’ dance was one
of the most cheery social interludes of the week.
Racing on Saturday has been our only other dis-
traction, and in spite of heat and* tennis woman was
there in plenty. Dressing was flimsy—sometimes very
flimsy—and was at its smartest in a navy-ctm-oriental
frock worn by one of our younger matrons.
Easily the biggest picnic of one firm in South
Aus. to date, was that just held by the Holden
Motorbody Co. The number that drove or railed
through the hills to Mount Barker is not known,
but 6340 sat down to lunch. It was a hot day.
and the nursing and hospital tent was well patronised
-—mainly for aspro tablets, it was reported. The
Mayor of Adelaide was present, also Premier Gunn,
who remarked that South Aus., having its wealth
comfortably distributed instead of in a few hand>,
owns a car for every 12 of its whole population.

The Williamstown (Vic.) C. F. On-
Stakes, a mile w.f.a. affair for which the club
hung up £5OO in prize-money, provided a capital
race on Saturday, although there were only five
starters. Whittier and The Night Patrol were each
at 6 to 4, with Heroic at fours, Lausanne (who had a
substantial allowance) twenties, and Spearfelt
twenty-fives. Heroic, who looked a bit above him-
self, was nasty at the barrier, and lost a couple of
lengths when they moved off. The Night Patrol
and Lausanne were out in front early, and the
Sydney horse was a trifle ahead at the six furlongs,
but the Governor’s horse led round the home turn,
with Whittier going easily in second place. When
Toohey- called on the Woorak horse he
Mght Patrol without an effort and won nicely by
a long neck from Heroic, who had tome n.cii a
£ rea t rUn 011 rails, with The Night Patrol a
length and a quarter away. Lausanne was eight
lengths behind the English stallion, and Spearfelt
last. Whittier, who ran the distance in lmin. 40*sec.,
has been a good friend to Ben Chaffey, and no
gamer little horse has ever been seen on a race-
course. Heroic and Lausanne will obviously have to
be considered for the Newmarket Handicap, in which
the former has 9st. Blb. and the latter Bst. Spearer

hmsh was impressive. Spearer, who is a five-year-

(threes), who finished well, third. Fuji San
carried 9st. 91b., 4lb. more than he has in the New-
market, and ran the six furlongs in lmin. 13£sec.,
vhich is smart for Caulfield. He completed a
double for Toohey, “Tieh” Wilson having pre-
viousiy landed a double on Lanson, a two-year-Md

went m e the .y ay home, for five of the eight races
went to favorites —Coolahville (3’s) and the ver-
promising Hazelmere (evens) in the divided Maiden
Handicap; J. A. Murdoch’s 1750-guinea two-year-old
Jack Point (5 to 4) in the Juvenile Handicap; King
Gy Irene (6 to 4) in the Gold Cup; and Mingelo
(7 to 4) in the Welter. Few begrudged R. J. Whit-
taker his success with King Cyllene, who had been
very unfortunate since his second in the A.J.C.
Doncaster, but Loquat, the runner-up, might have been
closer with a preliminary race or two, and Resource,
the other place-getter, will do better at 10 or 12
furlongs. Pike gave a capital display on Mingelo,
who, under the name of Mystery Lad, was,a champion
in Central Queensland, where he was bought by
Matthews, the Sydney bookmaker. Though no aristo-
crat either in appearance or breeding (he is by
Stormbird colt—Go On), he is decided»y useful. In
spite of his good showing at Canterbury Park, sixes
were available about Greendalc, who made hacks of
Murray King (2 s) and 11 others in the Moorefield
Handicap. This English horse beat Scarlet a weik
or so before she won the Sydney Cup, and he should
have another victory or two before long, altncugh
he seldom runs well except at Moorefield and Canter-
bury Park.
* * * *
“Doomben”: In Queensland a jockey is
rarely disqualified for stopping a horse, but it is
laid down that the pulling must not be so gloss and
palpable as to shock the public conscience. If all
the non-triers were disqualified on certain courses, it
would be difficult to collect enough horses to make
up a field. An unwritten rule prescribes that if an
unwanted horse inadvertently gets out in iront he
must not be strangled in full view of patrons.
This rule comps hard oh owners when, as occasionally
happens, there is not a single trier in the race, but
it is good training for youthful jockeys in the fine
art of stopping ’em.
The long-standing trttuble bettveen Hogan
and Tom Wigley, stipendiary stewards for S.A. Jockey
Club, has had an airing. Hogan disagreed with
the judgment of Wigley and Cieni Hill which took
a race away from Hope’s Biskra, and on “words”
passing between the two officials the S.A..J.C. dis-
pensed with Wigley’s services. On a requisition
from the statutory number of members, the club
held a special meeting to consider the matter. A
crowd attended, but nothing much came of it;
Wigley, although a lawyer, damaged his ease by
using uncomplimentary language to the chairman,
W. B. Carr, and an ultimate show of hands gave
him only a few votes. It is possible, however, that
more may be heard of the ease. An uneasy feeling
Is shown by various members in letters to the
newspapers, largely in connection with a state meet
by a Register reporter that his shorthand notes of
the original inquiry were kept till he was told
officially he need not transcribe them, and were then
destroyed as unwanted.
“Shrewsbury”: The death, at 27, of that
great mare Sceptre recalls the regret of British
sportsmen, when she was retired to the stud, that she
had not raced under happier auspices. Bred at the
famous Sykes stud at Sledmere, Yorkshire, Sceptre
was early in the limelight when Australia’s old
acquaintance Bob Sievier gave 10,000 guineas for her
as a yearling. She was so far ahead of her rivals
as a three-vear-old that her failure in the Derby,
notoriously a diffic ult race for fillies in England,
was taken very badly by the public. She cleaned
up the other classifcs in such hollow fashion that the
big section of British betters who had made her
a hot favorite for the Derby indulged in extremely'
nasty but quite unwarranted criticism of her punter-
owner. Sievier won over 2.5,000 with his flier,
and sold her for another £ 25,000. Though given
every chance at the stud, she never produced any'-
thir.g a twentieth as good as herself.
Good matchmaking and moderate charges
have made Pat McHugh’s Leichhardt boxing hall
a formidable rival of the Sydney Stadium. There
was a “capacity” house when Queenslander Joe
Esler (9st.)’ met Jim Tibbetts (Bst. 13£ib.).
The featherweights provided a great contest,
W. P. BATT, designer and shipper of Tassie,
which has proved far and away the best
Australian yacht in the 21-25 feet re-
stricted class. At Fremantle last week,
as at Hobart last year, she easily won
the races for the Forster (three heats)
and Albert Cups.
in which Tibbetts, one of the cleanest and
slickest boxers in N. S. Wales, showed remarkable
skill in hitting and makirg the other fellow miss.
The swarthy son of old-timer Tom Esler (“the
Kaffir”) took his punishment stoically, although his
mouth became gory and his countenance much swollen
and distorted. He grew very weary, too, and had
Tibbetts had a hard wallop, Joseph must have been
outed. Jim, however, tired under the incessant
attack and worrying, and was twice on the canvas
-—for seven seconds in the 12th and for five seconds
in the 15t.h. For this reason, apparently, referee
Ernie Elliott crowned Esler, but the present scribe
would have given it to Tibbetts.
* * * *
“Past Grammar” : An attempt to revive
public boxing by women in London has been howled
down. Our ancestors were less squeamish. Ladies
often appeared in the ring in the glorious days when
bull-baiting, dogfighting, cocking and ratting were
the nation’s joys, and a boxing match between two
‘‘Amazons,’ as they were politely called, was a stand-
ing dish at Hockley-in-the-Hole, that classic hub
of old-time London sport, the prize being invariably
“a new shift.” Western Queensland shows once knew
a lady boxer who could use the mitts as well as
most men. She used to spar three rounds with
all comers in the intervals of being a tattooed lady.
* * » *
The Melbourne public avoided the Stadium
in large numbers when the unsmiling “Sunn}'” Jim
Williams (list. opposed Westralian George
Thompson (12st. 81b.), and thereby showed excellent
judgment. Referee Quirk did more work in the ring
than either of the pugs ; he had the unenviable jot)
of prising two persistent huggers apart during 20
monotonous rounds. Few clean punches were landed
during the fiasco, and a left lead was a thing un-
known. Thompson got the decision from the ex-
hausted Quirk.
With ordinary luck, Cecil Brown could
have brought his weekly income from Maroubra
(N.S.W.) speedway up to £l5 on Saturday, and
won enough money otherwise to nay expenses. But
his rabbit’s foot had been left at home. After
winning his heat in the All-powered Motorcycle
Handicap, in which he touched a speed of nearly
100 m.p.h., his 7-ii.p. Indian devcloped carburetter
trouble, the result of a knock while the mount was
being groomed, and he could obly r get third place
in the final. In the Maroubra Silver Cup, a 10-miles
scratch race, Brown rode a 3i-h.p. Indian Prince,
the race being confined to machines of medium
power. He won his heat with ridiculous ease
but his mount broke down in the final. Thereby
he missed the £5 a week which the cup carries
Until its holder is defeated. He already draws £lO
a week as holder of the Maroubra Gold Helmet,
won on Dec. 26, and suftessfullv defended on Jan.
26, and on Saturday his mo;.t dangerous rival, Spencer
Stratton, the Maorilander, was not competing. K.
Carmody, who nde a 3d-h.p. A.J.S. faultlessly
throughout the day, won both events. There was
not a great deal of interest in the car racing. The
Lucky Devil Cup, previously held by A. E. Cooper,
could not be defended by the holder, whose Ballot
ear was smashed to bits on the speedway some
weeks ago, and it went to R. G. Garlick and his
super-charged Alvis. A five-miles handicap for cars
un to 1500 cc. gave the Brescia-Bugattis their
thance, and a trio of the little Italians filled the
places.

“Hotham”: Tbe U.S. Olympic peds.
Seholz and Hahn are warming up to their work as
they are becoming acclimatised in Maoriland. At
M/isterton last Saturday, Hahn ran a mile in a
fifth of a second worse than the Australasian record
put up by another American. J A. Power, who ran
it 12 years ago, also at Masterton, in 4min. 18 2-ssec.
That is just Bsec. worse than Paavo Nurmi’s world’s
record. Rose, whom Hahn defeated by 18 yards, was
given a chance against Nurmi by his optimistic
countrymen. Scholz covered 100 yards in 9 4-ssec.
and 220 in 21 4-ssee. The time for the sprint
equals the Australasian record put up by W. T.
Macpherson in 1891, while the 220 time is a
fraction slower than “Slip” Carr’s Australasian
record of 2Usee.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Hnwkes absolutely dominated
the Australian tennis championships. On the final
day in Adelaide, he added the mixed doubles (with
Miss Boyd) to his bag; in this kind of game, his
left handed screwing service seems to be a thing
no woman can deal with effectually. In the singles,
he showed conclusively that any doubts as to his
staying out a five-set match can now be set aside.
Some of the newspaper critics spoke severely to
Anderson for his apparent lack of interest towards
the end, especially in the doubles, where he and
O'Hara Wood scored only seven games in all in
the three straight sets which Hawkes and Patterson
took from them. The tournament was well managed,
and, though there was some grumbling when the
prices climbed up to ss. 10d., including tax,
Adelaide surprised itself and the officials by providing
a “gate” of well over £lOOO.
Hnwkes continued his victorious career in the
Vie.-N S.W. match at Melbourne, defeating Jim
Wi'lnrd in straight sets, 6—3, 6—2. 6—o. O’Hara
Wood found Reims a tougher proposition, but gained
a hard-fought fifth set. 6 —3, 6—2. 2—6. 4—6. 7—5.
J. O. Anderson was shaping well with Peach against
Patterson and Sthlesingcr when he retired to rest
a doubtful ankle for his tussle against Patterson
next day. Willard, who filled the gap, was very
much out of touch, and the Victorians won in
straight sets. The Patterson-Anderson match was a
poor affair, and it wasn’t improved as a spectacle by
an exhibition of contempt for the linesmen on the
part of both plavers. Patterson triumphed at 6—4,
6—3, 6—4, Schlesinger having previously downed
Peach, 6—2, 6—2, 6 —4. Kalins and Willard
retrieved a few sprigs of N.S.W.’s lost laurels by
vanquishing Hawkes and O’Hara Wood, B—6, 6—3,
6—4 • but altogether it was an ignominious beating
f ‘" *■’ ""ps., who won only four sets
out of the 19 played.
“Shrewsbury”; It’s about time the lawn-tennis
heads squelched the practice of defying an umniro’s
decision by deliberately throwing away points in
order to correct the official’s alleged mistake. Slob-
bering press-writers make matters worse bv applaud-
ing the “sportsmanship” of this kind of thing, when,
as a matter of fact, it is in direct conflict with
one of the basic principles of sportsmanship, that the
referee’s or umpire's decision is not to be questioned
in any circumstances. The match between Patterson
and Anderson was reduced to a farce because of
tbe exalted attitude of these rather tiresome young
men. “At one period the players practically took
the match into their own hands,” I read. First
Anderson “disagreed with a decision” and “brushed
Patterson’s service aside.” Then Patterson “dis-
agreed,” so banged his next two services into the
net. Anderson, in his turn, “disagreed” with that,
and did not try to take the next service so
Patterson served a double fault. These impertinences
s nor id be rewarded with suspension, not newspaper
slobber.
* * • #
There was o»i> surprise i"
swimming championships at the Claremont (W.A )
baths. It occurred in the 220vds. free-trie, when Moss
Christie, the N.S.W. champion, could get no closer
than third to the vmffhful Queenslander R. Grier and
the Westralian “Brusher” Jones. Grier’s time was
2min. 30 2-6 sec. In winning his heat, Christie had
registered 2min. 29 2-ssec., while Grier (Jones ftas
second in his heat) took 2min. 31 4-ssec.; but the
Queenslander’s superiority was decisive in the final.
Later in the week the N. S. Wales crack annexed the
880 yards after a great race with Jones, who is a
first-class lad but dislikes the drudgery of training.
Christie won by three yards in llmin. 44 8-ssem,
Grier being a long way back, third. The mile was
a runaway, Christie winning by 60 yards from Jones
in 24min. 24 4-ssec.; another Westraliah, H. Taylor,
was third. F. Carberry (N.S.W.) retained the 100
yards back-stroke easily in lmin. 15see., and Sousaari,
the Queensland fisherman, clipped 3 2-Ssec. off the
Westralian record in winning the 220 yards breast-
stroke championship in 3min. Usee. Stevens (W.A.)
was a good second to Sousaari.

“Shrewsbury”: A sport which has never
gripped public fancy in Australia to any' great
extent is hockey. It is certainly played in all the
States, with occasional inter-State matches, but it
gets little publicity,
and not a tithe of the
following accorded to
lawn tennis, which is
also played by both
sexes. In other coun-
tries, especially in Eng-
land, the pastime is
seriously rivalling foot-
ball among amateurs, so
much so that Oxford
Uni. has decided to
grant a “full blue’’ for
hockey. Short of an
actual consecration of
the game by the arch-
bishops of Canterbury
and York, mere mortal
approval could go no
further.
TOM HOWARD,
who is going to
have a shot at the
open golf cham-
pionship in Britain.
He is the Concord
(N.S.W.) Club’s
pro.
Lansdowne : At least one Australian
team for England sustained a change after it was
picked. That was 30 years ago, when Clem Hill,
who had failed to catch the eye of the selectors,
wound up the season in such a blaze of glory that
public opinion insisted he couldn’t be left out. The
difficulty was got oyer by putting him into the place
that had been assigned to Jack Harry (Vic.) and
paying the latter £lOO (I think) as compensation
for his blasted hopes. Public opinion is probablv
as strong to-day about the injustice to the man—
and the injury to the side —wrought by the non-
inclusion of Kelleway, but what between a Board
of Control that professes its inability to interfere
with selectors’ choices and selectors who can’t be
expected to admit that they haven’t picked the
best team available, it looks as if p.o. will have
to lump it.
* * * *
“Mathari”: The gents, who selected the
team for England will derive no comfort
from the Sheffield Shield batting averages.
For N.S.W. Kippax (112) is first and
Kelleway (89.80) second; for S.A., Alexander
(64) leads from V. Richardson (50.12) and Rymill
(39.57). Jack Scott (S.A.) collected most wickets
—22 at 37.63, while Blaekie (Vic.) took 20 at
33.50; of the others, Grimmett gathered 20 at
48.80, Hendry 19 at 27.36, and Mailey 19 at 37.52.
Either the bowling was darned bad or the batting
was exceptionally good; at all events, eleven N.S.W.
batsmen average over 40.33; six Victorians exceed
33.27 ; and seven S. Australians topped 30.00. N.S.W.
accumulated 3202 runs, averaging 64.04, against
2304 runs, averaging 29.16 ; Vic. scored 2448, averag-
ing 31.38, against 2542, averaging 42.36; while S.
Aus. knocked up 2278, averaging 29.08, against 3082,
averaging 45.32. N.S.W. called on 13 players, S. Aus.
used 16, and Vic. dragged 21 into the limelight.
Several of the Victorians were intercepted while they
were on their way to collect the old-age pension.

“Tickle”: In Carl Schneider, who is leav-
ing Melbourne for Adelaide, South Oss has acquired
Victoria’s most promising colt. Playing for Xavier
College, Carl made so many centuries and took sb
many wickets with his googlies that Melbourne found
a place for the boy in its XI. Promoted to the
Victorian colts and the State’s second XI, he scored,
in consecutive hands, 55, 43, 64, 38 and 100 n.o.
In the recent match against N. S. Wales seconds, he
got a chanceless 75. Schneider possesses all the
cricketing qualities except brawn and height. He
has the strokes and precision in placing of a
champion, but lacks, as yet, power. He runs between
wickets like a Hobbs, and in the field is fast and
accurate. His bowling is modelled on Mailey’s, and
has been destructive except against first-class bats.
Carl was also the champion footballer of the colleges,
and Richmond was looking forward to the time when
a little more bulk would make him a worthy Tiger.
* * * •
“Hamer”: The simple faith which is more
than Mosman blood is still to be found in Sydney. In
an ultra-religious family of my acquaintance it had
been alleged against a young fellow that he went to
picnics on Sunday. “He certainly does not,” came
the indignant repudiation. “He’s a most devout
young man —why he plays cricket in the churches’
competition.”
• * * *
“Centurion” : It. H'. Bettington, the former
King’s School (N.S.W.) boy, who won his Rugby,
cricket and golf blue at Oxford, and has played Rugby
for England and cricket for the Gentlemen, has now
qualified for Middlesex. R.H. promised to be a
great slow bowler and a punishing batsman. Some
of his friends blame Rugby for his failure to reach
the mountain tops of cricket; others, prpbably with
justice, accuse golf. The only other Australian
amateur who played regularly for Middlesex was
W. F. Ramsay, of Queensland and Cambridge, who
later turned out occasionally for his native State.
Albert Trott, Frank Tarrant and Mick Roche, of
the maimed hand, were Aussies who did great things
for the county as professionals.
THE PRINCE OF SPILLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Prince of Wales, who recently had his
thirteenth accident in the hunting-field, may claim
to have sustained a fall with almost every leading
pack in England.”
From Badminton to what they call “the shires,”
Wherever foxes o’er the landscape flee
And thrusters pick their line and sail serene
Over the obstacles that intervene,
There’s scarce a hunting county hasn’t seen
Me and my prad dissolving company.
Brook, hedge and ditch, light fence and solid wall,
As saddle-emptiers I’ve tried 'em all.
The day may come when Ministries I’ll send
Unto the country should I deem it fit,
And give occasion to some sportive elf
To dub me first of all the Windsor-Guelph
Line who has tried the recipe himself,
And very thoroughly, you must admit.
Sprawling so oft upon the greensward prone
I ought to know a bit about the Throne.
Mine is the sport of kings—a deathless phrase
That Jorrocks never to the turf applied—
War’s image, with but twenty-five per cent.
Its dangers, but that calculating gent.
Towards handy gates invariably went;
He didn’t tear across the countryside
And into lots of needless perils plunge,
Nor, for the matter o’ that, did Soapy Sponge,
I’ve trod the Empire to its utmost ends,
Let English fields are closer to my heart.
How can I tell you which I love the best
Who so impartially my lips have prest
To England, north and south and east and west,
From Ouse to Severn and from Trent to Dart t
From Market Harborough to Cotswold's hills
I’ll live in history as the Prince of Spills.

THE INKY WAY.
“Toe II,” which is making rapid strides
throughout the Empire, has just lighted its
own torch, the Link, in Melbourne, As
the society’s “Lamp of Remembrance” is
taken from the lamps used by the early
Christians in the catacombs, so the Link
gets its name from the old London custom of
sending linkmen to lead wayfarers through
the fog to safety.
“Wheeler”: The Auburn (N.S.W.) paper’s
offer to keep police-court offenders’ names
out of print, provided they contribute to the
local hospital (B. 7/l/’2G), is not original.
Twenty-live years ago every issue of the Bulli
(N.S.W.) Times contained the following
announcement: “Police-court offenders who
do not want their cases published must con-
tribute to the Bulli Hospital.” The tariff
followed- —ss. for drunkenness, and so on —
and there was rarely any court news to print.
Old journalists die hard. Recently, after
reading of his many virtues and being nearly
snowed under messages of condolence that
poured into his house, a veteran Inky Way-
farer named Patrick Galvin, of Wellington
(M.L.), had sufficient breath left to assert
his continued existence. It was another Pat-
rick Galvin w r ho had died, also a resident of
the Breezy City, and, like his namesake, born
in Ireland 80 years or so ago. Both men
left in their ’teens for the Australian gold-
fields, and hopped over to the Otago rushes
a while later. One went into a newspaper
office; the other climbed to the driver’s box
of one of the pioneer coaches on the West
Coast of Maoriland.
“N.P.”: Pereival Serle, whose very pains-
taking and solid “Bibliography of Australian
Poetry and Verse” is reviewed on the Red
Page (21/l/’2t»), is a rare type of Austra-
lian. A few years ago he retired from the
business staff of Melbourne University; and
ever since he has been working at other
men’s books. Two years ago he published a
very good edition of Christopher Smart’s
“Song of David,” a volume that had been out
of print for about 100 years. And now
comes his bibliography with all its grada-
tions, to be followed by his “History of
Poetry in Australia,” which will be an even
longer job. He is absolutely devoted to his
chosen tasks, and his quiet old home at
Hawthorn is a rendezvous for bookish people.
His carefully collected library is a thing to
dream of, and he has also a fine collection
of black-and-white work.
James Ashton, whose contribution to
N.S.W. Hansard on the second reading of
the Council Abolition Bill was far above the
average, served his time to N.S.W. up-
country newspapering. Starting as a comp,
at Goulburn, he afterwards set type at Hay,
and ultimately became proprietor of the
Riverina Grazier. Another provincial
sheet of his was the Narrandera Argus. The
late Sam McCaughey once wrote to the
Argus to say that, owing to the inroads made
on his income by the new State land-tax, he
would be unable to remain a subscriber.
Ashton replied with an expression of regret
that he had been helping to cripple the wooi-
king, and added that he had given instruc-
tions for him to be placed on the free list
Ashton and he afterwards became great
friends, and presently the ex-newspaper man
found himself helping to administer the mil-
lionaire’s estate.
“Awstruth”: Before the war I was run-
ning a 3mall post office in the Western
District of Victoria. One Sunday afternoon
all stations on the ’phone line from Geelong
to Hamilton were called and instructed to
take down a long official message. When we
were all set, along came a detailed ana
realistic story of a regular armada of Japan-
ese warships which was bearing dovvn on
Australia, the number and type of tnc
various vessels being given. At the comple-
tion of the message the humorist at the .tar
end of the line asked all stations had ; they
got it. Along the line went the “0.K., ana
then we were told, “Well, you can tear i
up, and what would you be doing it you
hadn’t been doing this!” The recipient oi
the message at Hamilton got so excited tnai
he didn’t wait to give 0.K., but dashed into
the,-newspaper office next door with his copy
in his hand. The editor, getting almost a-
excited as the telephonist, when he found tn-
message bearing the name of the 4 D.l •«*. *•
of the period, promptly shot it into tyP e -
Fortunately, before publishing his sheet, i 1
took the precaution of asking the local pose
master if the message was absolutely
genuine. When he was disillusioned j
became quite the maddest editor south or w
ILine.
THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lord Muggins rode a fiery steed
Across the'fallow land;
The Duke of Mudshire came with speed
To lend the show a hand.
Then rose from off his earthly throne
The Prince in splendid style;
And one that held a megaphone
Roared “Now, your Highness! Smile!”
Photographers, black-hooded, cold,
Stood by in dreadful rows,
Each with a fierce desire to hold
The lens before his nose.
He smiled on that black-hooded throng
A smile serene and bland;
The Duke of Mudshire came along
And grasped his lily hand.
The little rubber balls of air
Were squeezed with loyal zeal;
The Prince smoothed down his ruffled hair—
“ This picture should appeal.”
“Next fall,” a voice was heard to cry,
“On Monday week at three ;
A flag of red and blue will fly
Where it’s arranged to be.
“Be early. There’s a special place
Made soft at Rushdon’s Fen;
The Prince will ride beside his Grace.
And thank you, gentlemen.”
But all this happened long ago
In some far Norman spring;
So tall green rushes in a row
Still sing “God save the King!”

Although the Ward-Fullers’ new Sydney
building, running from Elizabeth-street to
Castlereagh-street, is still a confused pile of
scaffolding and concrete, the firm continently
announces the opening for March 26. On
present appearances the challenge to Time
seems heroic; but the firm backs its confi-
dence by an .invitation to first-nighters to put in
their applications for seats. The St. James's
opening bill is to be “No, No Nanette,” which
ran to magnificent business in Melbourne,
at the capacious New Princess Theatre, for
154 performances, and was still lull of
fsdash when the principals were comman-
deered for the Ward-Fuller Christmas pro-
ductions.
,** * %
The line "Episodes Mirrored from the
Divorce Court” thrown into some of the
advts. of “The Pelican” suggests the hand of
the movie publicity man; the play, well
constructed in spite of its obstetric conver-
sation, does not deserve that touch of cheap-
ness. Mary Hinton is losing her amateur-
ishness, and shows great improvement; but
her opportunities as Wanda Heriot are
limited. “The Pelican’s” days are num-
bered ; “White Cargo” is due at Sydney
Royal next Saturday week.
“Katja” continues its reign at Her
Majesty's (Sydney).
v '!* *!»
The adventures of a middle-aged widower
in search of a wife are still expounded at
Sydney Palace, where “The Farmer’s Wife”
provides a very satisfying repast.
sjt sjs
“Give and Take” is repeating at the
Sydney Criterion its experiences at the
Athenaeum, Melbourne, the audiences having
gone from good to best; and Park-street,
with its pack of cars, is a dazzling sight
every night. Some of the playgoers, sensing
a good industrial moral, take the show very
seriously—a tribute to the solidly good plot
with which Aaron Hoffmann preaches his
sermon in farce.
THE KARREYS,
AT MELBOURNE
TIVOLI.
“Hurry up, we can't stay
like this all night!"
“But I’ve forgotten the
way out!”
“Cinderella” weds her Prince for the last
time to-morrow (Friday) night; and on
Saturday the Neil-Tuohy company will in-
troduce the old-time laugh-maker “Are You
a Mason?” to the Grand Opera House
(Sydney).
** * *
Sydney Tivoli found its bill in no need of
radical change this week, but solemn warn-
ing is given that Holbein is to add the dis-
appearing trick to his other performances,
arid that Ella Shields is not staying long.
Holbein’s is mainly a trick act, and the
tricks are humorously managed, but he does
enough lightning sketching to show that he
could rely upon that if he cared to. “Ye
Olde Minstrel Show” adequately fills the first
part, and is increasing its popularity. And
the Four Karreys do their best to show
that what it should be humanly impossible to
do with the human frame isn’t.
The sonorous wide-ranged bass of Will
Ennis is the most distinguished item in
Fullers’ Old Nigger Minstrels; its vaulty
depths are as magnificent as the tonal steps
up which it climbs are surprising. But the
singer who knows so well what to do with
liis voice appears to be made miserable by
his body. A study of stage ease would help
Ennis to get rid of a heavy handicap. Re-
cently-returned Australians Bob Needham and
Frank Foster sing their ballads well; but
some of the comedians are as saddening as
their gags are ancient. Jim Gerald calls his
new revue “Not Likely.” It might as reason-
ably have been christened “Impossible”; but
the knock-about humor and incidentals are
up to the average considered necessary for
revue.
$
Randy Farman, in “The Lucky Devil,”
takes a daring course to success in a motor-
car won in a raffle. Its original owner has
been glad to get rid of a machine that has
landed him in much trouble, but Farman
(Richard Dix), although he has merely a
few dollars and has to part w'ith accessories
to buy petrol, turns the car to good account.
How he pulls off a 10,000-dollar prize with a
’bus stripped of practically everything but
the engine and the wheels makes a good
story of action, to which Hoyt’s De Luxe
(Sydney) adds “Wages for Wives,” a pic-
ture giving much more amusement to audi-
ences than husbands are ever likely to get
from the financial problem. The Lyceum
picture, “My Wife and I.” travels a dusty,
over-used track: and the horse Silver King
is the outstanding actor of “The Bandits’
Baby,” merely a crude action story served
with sob sauce. After its long run at the
Prince Edward, “Scaramouche” will come
off in a couple of weeks. Much less deserv-
ing a long run, Charlie Chaplin’s “Gold
Rush” is in its fifth week at the Crystal
Palace.
** * *
A rather school-break-uppish play, “The
Rising Generation,” was produced by H. W.
Y 7 arna and his amateurs at St. James’s the
other night. The play, by Wyn Weaver
and Laura Leycester, is an innocuous piece
of fun (too gentle to be called satire) at
the expense of Youth that thinks experience
one of the inessentials of life. The whole
theme is milk-and-watery and as stimulating
as bread-and-butter pudding, but the play
was extraordinarily well produced, and there
was none of the crudeness about any of the
cast that makes for the onlooker’s discom-
fort. Indeed, William Hume as Puddifer the
butler gave as mellow and discerning a
character sketch as might be expected from
a seasoned pro. The North Sydney Orches-
tral Society filled the little hall to bursting
with strains of “lolanthe.”
#$ $ $
A different picture show:—
A Bulletin suggestion regarding the use of the
screen in education appealed to Mr. T. W. G.
Dawson, geography master at Scots’ College (Sydney) ;
and a picture entitled “Irrigation,” given a private
screening this week, is the first-fruits of a proposi-
tion he made to Australasian Films. Incidentally,
Australasian Films already has a considerable stock
of films intended to be educational. Dawson devoted
his holidays to the direction of the picture, which
gives a general idea of the progress made in the
various irrigation areas, and the displacement of
stunted bush by spreading farms and such fine towns
as Mildura, Griffith and Leeton. Such interesting
details as that in the Murrumbidgee area there are
now 2000 acres under rice are incorporated in the
film a well-prepared and informative pictorial
summary of the usefulness of irrigation, although
the interior factory projections suffer from the absence
of a proper lighting plant for such scenes.

The fare at the Athenaeum, Melbourne, is
still that mixture of damper and sparkling
hock, “Kangaroo Flat.”

Jack will plant his miraculous vegetable
for the last time at Melbourne Princess to-
morrow night. On Saturday at the matinee
“The Honeymoon Girl” will commence her
career. The amusers who made “No, No,
Nanette!” such a shining success are stated
to have been enlisted for the occasion.

The new sketches introduced last week
into “The Music-Box” revue at Melbourne
Palace are receiving the earnest and, in
general, approving attention of connoisseurs.

Sinister rumors to the effect that this
country is burning with a desire to see Renee
Kelly in “Daddy Longlegs” are emanating
from the direction of Williamson’s cave of
propaganda. They inspire the belief that
“Polly with a Past” at the King’s will put it
all behind her in a week or so.
** * *
“Lilac Time” is still rivalling spring-time
as the only pretty ring-time at Melbourne
Royal.

“Aladdin,” now in its eighth week at
Melbourne Ajiajesty’s, will from Saturday
have no competitor in the field of juvenile

Entrepreneurs continue to have regard for
the populace’s new-found distaste for jazz,
although their substitutes scarcely blaze
with originality. Melbourne Bijou announces
for next Saturday- night Ye Olde-time Nigger
Minstrels, a form of entertainment we seem
to remember the rival house two doors down
the street exploiting not so very long ago.
In the meantime the sad hosts of mediocrity,
including Mdlle. Odette Delage, a French
violinist; Edwards and Hughes, sketch
artists; and Southvvood and the Pink Lady
contrive to eke out the evening. Gayle Wyer
has another revue, “When the Cat’s Away,”
a moderately potent laugh-raiser. This in-
defatigible playwright and producer will soon
rival the records of William Shakspeare and
Allan Wilkie.
“GIVE AND TAKER
AT THE SYDNEY CRITERION.
Roy Rene, as Albert Kruger, demands a
share in the profits of the Bauer busi-
ness, and Harry Green, as John Bauer,
offers him a share in the deficit.
Melbourne Tivoli programme this week
pbserves the Golden Mean, neither descend-
ing to the very, very bad nor rising to the
very, very good, inly Morris arrives on the
stage with a suddenness suggesting' that she
comes “direct from the leading theatres in
England and America” per aeroplane. She is
stout and breezy, and her humor has enough
roughage with it to ensure prompt passage
to the hearts of many hearers. Les Coney is
a comedian who produces chestnuts that were
hoary when Hammurabi was a lad, and
does it with the deadly impersonality of a
cigarette-machine ejecting the wrong coin.
Reeder and Armstrong romp with a couple
of grand pianos, Corinne Arbuckle sings as
an electrically-driven pianola plays, the Ash-
leys throw clubs about with a seeming reck-
lessness, the Hell Bells Band continues to
be possessed by 20 musical devils, and the
seven Hollanders do ah average tumbling
turn. Notable among the tumblers is the
dwarf. He would have been a fine asset to a
Byzantian court. The four Karreys did im-
possible things with what one lady in the
audience Called their “abominable muscles”
for the last time on Saturday, and on Monday
Bob Albright brought some brisk humor,
stated to be cowboy, to the scene.
* * * $
Hoyt’s Melbourne house this week is pro-
viding a rival to the motordrome in “The
Lucky Devil,” who takes risks in celluloid
which would surely mean a sudden and un-
tidy end in real life. Tom Mix, in “(fho
Everlasting Whisper,” does the same sort of
thing with horseflesh. At the Majestic, “A
Girl of the Limberlost” should prove a draw.
Gene Stratton Porter wrote the hook and
two million people have read it. The sup-
porting picture, “Proud Flesh,” is placed in
Frisco and concerns the love of an Irish
plumber for a Spanish hidalgo’s daughter.
The plumber shows hirqself more energetic
in prosecuting his suit under difficult circum-
stances than the usual member of the species
exhibits in mending a leak under the kitchen
sink. The comedy is good. A scenic of
Maoriland inspires the melancholy thought
that there is a mort of marvellous back-
grounds for moving pictures running to
waste in Australasia.
* * * *
On Sunday afternoon this fellow-country-
man of Nellie Melba went to the Exhibition
Oval, Melbourne, to hear the Australian Sil-
ver Band, which has just returned from a
triumphal tour of Maoriland and claims the
celebrated A. H. Baile as its conductor. A
large crowd sat eating ice-licks in the stands.
The temperature was 110 or thereabouts.
The sun blazed down on a roofless dais
camouflaged with hessian on which, in thick
serge uniforms and with handkerchiefs tucked
under their caps, sat the heroes, looking as
if they might burst into flames instead of
into music. Drawing in large chunks of
heat-wave, they blew it through their instru-
ments in the “Zampa” overture and other
pieces. The enervated notes struggled across
the furnace of space in a frantic effort to
escape sunstroke in the shelter of the
Pavilions. Many of them perished miserably
half-way, but the remnant flung itself in a
last effort on the eardrums of an appreciative
crowd. Although the cornetist had to inter-
rupt the proceedings to run cold water over
the bearings of his instrument and the xylo-
phonist was observed to dissolve and run in
a thin stream of perspiration through his
tubes, the survivors churned their way un-
daunted through a formidable programme
while the listeners clapped their sweating
palms and ordered fresh relays of ice-creams.
It was an inspiring spectacle which contra-
dicted the opinion recently expressed by a
very great and dastardly authority that the
Australians are not a musical nation. A
populace that is prepared to kneel at the
shrine of St. Cecilia in the middle of a Mel-
bourne heat-wave is not lacking in true
reverence. It deserves encouragement. Its
passion for the melodic art demands a large
subsidy from the Federal Government. One
wonders why no bands play nightly in the
Botanic, Fitzroy and Alexandra gardens to
thousands of happy citizens sitting in the
coolth in open-air cafes under the trees.
♦* t *
Pictures are even more than usually pure
American in Adelaide just now. The York
has a good motoring drama in which Regi-
nald Denny streaks “Straight Ahead” for
California, with adventures on the way.
Wondergraph reconstructs the U.S.A. far
West of the time when Indians and buffalo
claimed to own most of it; and at West’s
Meighan and Lila Lee combine George Ade’s
humor with a lot of homely sentiment. Else-
where programmes are suited to the weather.
In this completely dry summer, the Garden
Theatre in the open attracts greatly, and at
the Majestic is a similar Midnight Frolic
mixture of cocktails. Even at the Royal
Nellie Bramley has ceased to be intense, and
is taking a comparatively small part in the
wildly farcical old “Are You a Mason?”
“Woorook”: Our maid-of-all-works, who,
however, refuses to do either my typing or
the ploughing, is 60 years of age and has
qualified for three widows’ pensions, so she
ought to know what she is .talking about.
When she heard that Valentino had been
mobbed by the girls in London she confided:
“And no wonder, either! Did you see him
in ‘The Sheik’ ? He was lovely! My Nellie
simply goes into sextasies about him.”

Wales Scottish Rifle Regiment became affili-
ated with the famous Black Watch, and the
colonel of the latter regiment is now com-
piling a list of all members of the N. S. Wales
S.R.R. who went west in 1914-18. The
intention is to inscribe the names in the
Black Watch bay of the Scottish National
Memorial at Edinburgh Castle. The matter
is complicated by the fact that the Aus-
tralian regiment ceased to exist in 1912, its
place being taken by the 25th (now 30th)
Infantry Battalion A.M.F. Many of its
members served in the A.I.F. or in British
regiments, but there is no complete record
in existence of what happened to members
after 1912. Colonel Norrie, in command of
the 30th Battalion A.M.F., whose h.q. are
in the T. and G. Buildings, Sydney,
invites friends and relatives of members of
the old Scottish Rifle Regiment who died on
service to communicate particulars to him.
The list is wanted also in collection with
the Memorial Carillon of the Sydney Uni-
versity.

In the Evening of Life
T ENGTHENING shadows that
mark the closing of life’s
brief day bid the exercise of
every physical care and the
provision of every bodily
comfort.
The system overwrought by a
race hard run, needs all the
assistance that nature and science
can afford, and the bodily benefits
that accrue from taking “One
Wolfe's Schnapps a day for
Your Health's Sake" become
of paramount importance.
The medicinal action of Wolfe’s
Schnapps due to the presence of the
potent extract of Italian Juniper, is to
assist the sluggish blood stream to
function more freely by ridding it
of the impurities that accumulate
particularly in later years.
If you are in life’s twilight, you will
derive immense comfort from the
moderate use of Wolfe's
Schnapps . If you are still in
the heyday you will do well to
adopt the sensible “One a day”
habit now and experience its
great benefits in after years.

Poverty
Point
“A.G.M.” (London) : Maud MacCarthy is
once more ,to add to the artistic delight of
London, which she brought to her feet 20
years ago when the Times hailed the child
violinist as a mature artist of phenomenal
powers. Maud is the wife of John A. Foulds,
the composer who wroth the incidental music
for the great Tagore’s film “Sacrifice,” and
the “World’s Requiem” ; and for their pro-
duction at the Polytechnic she has been
engaged to play selections of Indian music.
Maud inherits generously the varied gifts of
her father, Dr. Charles MacCarthy, whose
activities were a constant, delight to Sydney’s
art-world. She liasj 'spent many years in
India studying its philosophy and culture,
and by deep research has so mastered the
subject of Indian music as to‘earn the com-
mendation of Rabindranath Tagore himself,
who hails the little lady as the supreme in-
terpreter of his country’s harmony. She is
so small and elf-like that she might well
represent one of the fairies whom her father
hived to envisage.
“Hamfat”: “The Firm” might endeavor to
make up its mind whether its chief theatres
are memorials to a long-departed queen or
compliments to the present Sovereign, her
grandson. “Her Majesty’s” is the generally
accepted Sydney title, but the “Her” be-
comes “His” in some advertisements. In
Melbourne, the Exhibition-street showhouse
has in recent times been remodelled, and, the
opportunity having been taken to change the
name with the; buildijng, “His Majesty’s” is
the recognised designation. That name is
embossed on the J. Q. Williamson envelopes,
yet the Taits’ envelopes, issued from the same
playhouse, bear the legend “Pier Majesty’s
Theatre.” These managerial inconsistencies
never extend to box-oflice charges. Whether
at “Her” Majesty’s or “His,” they never
change.
“Strand”: London is enduring a round
of Russian drama. Three Tchekhov plays
—“The Cherry Orchard,” “The Sea Gull”
and “Ivanoff”—have been staged in quick
succession, with good highbrow attendances.
They are all gloomy affairs: the characters
commence talking about their woes in the
first act, and as a rule perish miser ibly in the
last. “Ivanoff” depicts a disagre ble young
man who, having killed his wife jj neglect,
is about to marry again when remorse catches
him by the throat. He decides that he is
bound to kill the second wife also, so he
pleasantly suicides in the presence of bride
No. 2 and the wedding guests. These Mus-
covite masterpieces support the impression
that the Russians are only really happy
when they are miserable.
“Hasen” : This from New York:—
The educational cinematograph expert has approved
of most of the 17 Commonwealth Government films
for exhibition to nearly a million New York school
children, though he criticises their brevity, amateurish-
ness and lack of human interest.
I saw a number of those films. I considered
their 10- or 15-minute brevity beside the long-
drawn-out agony of the latest Hollywood
seven-reeler—and gave thanks. I pondered
their “amateurishness” (they actually use
titles like “Sunrise” or “Daybreak on the
Farm” in place of good, skilled Hollywood-
ese, such as “Came the Dawn. The molten
East now spilled its Flowing Gold on Field
and Farm, on Burgeoning Crop and Lowing
Kine. Proud Chanticleer,” etc.) —I studied
this, I say, and gave thanks. I saw great
cities and farms and industries spill their
secrets for me, and noticed particularly the
sad luck of such “human interest” as un-
dressed flappers and unlovely lovers, bad men
and bootleggers, erring wives an(T white-
haired mothers o’ mine—-and gave most tre-
mendous thanks. So the educational cine-
matograph gentleman and I agree, after all,
each according to his lights.
“A.G.M.” (London) : A very definite note
of pessimism has been struck in the scale of
English drama by the retirement from the
Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, of Norman
Macdermott after five years of high endeavor
in which he has lost a large fortune, his
health and his illusions. He established a
repertory theatre in new ground, endowed it
with his wealth, and tried to create a public
for plays which, in addition to entertain-
ment, provided food for thought. In the first
18 months he and his friends spent-£40,000.
Since then all the loss has been his own.
Susan Glaspell’s “Inheritors” was staged at
Everyman during the last week of the old
year, and the critics have been generous to
this American woman who can command
eque'l success as novelist and playwright.
The last piece under the Macdermott regime
is to be G. K. Chesterton’s “The Man Who
Was Thursday.” Some fine work which
would otherwise never have got a public hear-
ing in London has been seen at the little
Hampstead theatre, but unfortunately in
many cases West End managers took the
Everyman successes away to the region of
the Strand. The failures were left.
“D. Major”: It was proposed the other
day to give patrons of the Sydney Town Hall
something better to sit on than the dreadful
Austrian chairs which cumber the audito-
rium, but the Labor aldermen —reasoning,
perhaps, that Town
Hall concerts are
the resorts of the
“borjoice,” not of
Bill the piek-and-
shovel artist —
turned the scheme
< down. By some
curious tradition
the comfort pro-
vided for the public
varies in different
kinds of shows in
inverse ratio to the
assumed quality of
the entertainment.
Whereas the mov-
ing-picture people
look after their
most humble
clients, the seating
accommodation in
the cheaper parts of
regular theatres is,
for the most part,
barbarous; and in
buildings devoted
to what is classed
as the highest form
of entertainment it
is the rule to make
those who attend
suffer torture, the
physical discomfort
being apparently
regarded as part of
the aesthetic treat-
ment. When the
highest form of
en t ert ainment
proves dull the
scraping and creak-
ing of chairs on the
part of restless
people adds to the
torment. Actually
it is at a high-grade
music-show that a
citizen most re-
quires to sit at ease
and let the harmony
flood his soul with-
out being disturbed by fears that his ham-
bones are dotting through his pants.
“John’s Wood” (London) : A quiet life
in domestic felicity on the outskirts of Lon-
don failed to make an enduring appeal to
Hilda Spong, who has sold her newdy-
acquired property at picturesque Edgeware
and returned to the lure of Broadway. In
May Miss Spong revisits England to spend
some time with her parents, who are very
comfortably settled at Totnes, in Devonshire.
Mr. Spong is still able to take delight in his
painting, but Mrs. Spong is a confirmed in-
valid.
“C. Ockney” : Pinero made no secret about
the title of his new play (B. 4/2/’26) ; he
“confided” it to the London press over three
months ago. It is “Dr. Harmer’s Holiday”
—a comedy in three acts. The veteran
dramatist has not struck the right manager
yet, so date of production is not settled.
“R.K.D.N.”: According to a cable, Hugh
Ward, who, for self and partners, has been
having a look round the London shows, ven-
tured the opinion that they were “a rotten
lot.” Consequently he had made only two
purchases for Australia, “Mercenary Mary,”
another of the interminable string of jazz
musical comedies from the U.S.A., and a
pantomime, “Puss in Boots.” Comment
would be superfluous.
“Nakhoda”: At a meeting of the Dayies-
ford (Vic.) branch of the Returned Sol-
diers’ League, Canon Yeo, president, ex-
pressed the opinion that all picture-shows
should be concluded with the playing of the
National Anthem, instead of people rushing
rudely to the doors as at present. The
Canon is badly astray in his selection of a
tune. It should be “The Star-spangled
Banner.”
“Ancient Prompter”: The manager had
strolled on to the stage to see how the
rehearsal of his new musical comedy was
going. He declared himself satisfied with
all and sundry. Then up spoke his recently-
imported conductor, who was, by the way,
the proud possessor of a Mus. Bac. degree.
“May I ask a favor, Sir?” The boss froze
immediately. “There you go. I no sooner
pay you a compliment than you want a
rise.” “Nothing of the kind, Sir,” the con-
ductor protested. “I only wanted to ask
your permission to have Mus. Baa printed
after my name on the programme.” “Cer-
tainly, my dear boy!” returned the manager,
“You can even have your coat of arms on
the act-drop. But not a bob more, mind you
—not a bob more!”
“Caesar’s Ghost”: A cocky in the Gore
district (M.L.) drove in to see the show,
and, having made the company’s acquaint-
ance, took a couple of us to spend Sunday
on his model farm. He told us that he had
once employed a stranded actor, who, being
a cheerful cuss, toon adversity in a good
spirit—or probably didn’t regard a steady
job as adversity after travelling with a
touring show—and made himself liked while
he stayed and regretted when he went. “He

had a way of giving the cows queer names
when he milked them, and they stuck,” the
farmer explained. “This is Juliet, and that’s
Desdemona, and there’s Olivia, Rosalind,
Beatrice and Katherine.” A question about
the bulls naturally followed. They were
Othello and Hamlet.
“Nero”: At a time when there is so
much talk of the wisdom and propriety of
importing all-English companies, if we must
import players at all, it might be informa-
tive to glance at the nationalities of the
members of the co. now playing “The Peli-
can” at Sydney Royal. To begin with, Mary
Hinton (Mrs. Pitt Rivers) is most certainly
English. Frank Harvey, who came here
some 12 years ago, served a strenuous ap-
prenticeship in the English provinces and
in London before he was brought here to
play in “Joseph and His Brethren.” Mayne
Lynton had a long theatrical experience in
England and America before he came to
Australia to play in “The Bat” some four
or five years ago. Everybody knows and
admires those talented sisters and charming
English ladies Mrs. Robert Brough and Miss
Emma Temple. Kenneth Brampton played
in England with, among other stars, the late
Edward 'Terry, had his own company in
South Africa, and dropped in here from an
Indian tour some 15 years back. Harvey
Adams, one of the more recent arrivals,
came to Australia with a well-earned English
reputation. Herbert Leigh, as has been men-
tioned (B. 4/2/’26), came from England via
S’Africa a good many years ago. Ronald
Ward first toured this country with George
Tully’s English comedy co., and was after-
wards a member of the Boucicault-Vanbrugh
combination. John Fernside spent his early
years in England and Scotland; and Nancy
Stewart, though Australian-born, was edu-
cated in Britain and has played both in Eng-
land and America, So the company at the
Royal is so nearly all-English that the dif-
ference doesn’t matter.
“Curtain-raiser”: London has seen “The
Sentimental Bloke” in print and in the
movies, and before very long will probably
see him on the boards. Judging by the Eng-
lish reception of both book and film, the
stage presentation should go well. There is
just enough difference between the true
Cockney type and his Australian derivative,
as interpreted by Dennis, to make the char-
acter comprehensible to English audiences
and at the same time instinct with exotic
charm. If arrangements now in train are
completed, Ginger Mick will look through
Tal Odell's optics, and Walter Cornock will
add his tonnage to the cast.
“Clerk”: “P.Y.0.” is wrong in saying
chairman Monash of the Vic. Electricity
Commission beat Railway Commissioner
Clapp into the field as a producer of Aus-
tralian films (B. 2S/l/’26). Clapp’s cinema
has been busy ever since he came here, more
than five years ago—in fact, his first film
was screened in the Yallourn district when
work on the big electric undertaking was just
being commenced. Clapp’s latest masterpiece,
“The Victorian Railways at Work,” was also
filmed and screened before Monash decided
to follow the railway fruit-booster’s lead.
Anyway, the electricity people can hardly call
themselves dinkum movie-producers so long
as they have to borrow Clapp’s operator and
machine before they can screen their substi-
tute for Hollywood sob-stuff.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: On Johnny
(“Widow O’Brien”) Sheridan’s tombstone in
Waverley Cemetery is the queer epitaph:
“I’m sorry I’m here, I am.”
“Hamfat”: Mary Jerrold, great-grand-
daughter of the Douglas Jerrold who wrote
“The Chronicles of Clovernook” and “Mrs.
Caudle’s Curtain Lectures,” is one of the
actresses on the way to Australia with Dion
Boucicault for the chain of Barrie plays lie
is to present. The lady began her stage
career in 1896, and has played such parts as
Stephanie de Beauharnais in “A Royal
Divorce,” Sarah in “Trelawney of the Wells,”
Rose Sibley in “Milestones,” Mrs. Frail
in “Love for Love” and Susan Throssel in
“Quality Street.” She was Mrs. Corbett
in the London production of “The Saving
Grace,” Haddon Chambers’s war play, which
did not quite hit the bull’s-eye, though it
contained at least one fine character and
many wise and witty lines.
“H.W.C.”: Billy Warner (B. 28/l/’26)
was the son of Henry Neil Warner, an old
actor rather famous in his day. I knew Billy
in the ’seventies, when we were boys to-
gether. His mother kept a boarding-house
in Victoria-street, Melbourne, opposite the
gaol. Billy never told me in those days of
his relationship, if any, to Pelham Warner.
Perhaps it was because “Plum” was only an
infant then.
“Evac”: Norman Lee, whose last appear-
ance here was with the Pauline Frederick
co., has decided to try his luck in Blighty,
and will sail next month.
“Civis”: The conductor of a Melbourne
musical society is an unsparing critic of the
choir. His contraltos recently displeased him
at a rehearsal. “Do you call that singing,
altos?” he barked. “You may call it singing,
but to me it sounds more like the gas escap-
ing.” Presently the gentleman had to rebuke
the basses. “Basses,” he roared, “you don’t
know the work. You are searching for your
notes. It won’t do, basses; the prospecting
days at Ballarat are over!” They were
wrestling with a piece for Ballarat’s South-
street competitions.
“Hamfat”: Belonging, as we did, to a com-
pany which was able to pay its way, Blathers
and I could afford to discuss the vagaries of
others with the landlord of the Cowflat Hotel,
who sorrowfully told us of his distressing ex-
periences with Hector D. Bombast, of Bom-
bast’s Imperial Dramatic Stars. We both
knew Hector; Blathers, indeed, having been
one of the Imperial Dramatic Stars, knew
him too well. “He seemed an honest bloke
to me,” the publican wailed. “And he paid
others. Directly lie arrived he showed me
three hotel receipts—just to assure me, he
said, that he didn’t bilk his creditors like
some other theatricals.” To Blathers’s in-
terested inquiry, the hotelkeeper admitted
that he had not noticed any date on the re-
ceipts. “Thought not,” commented Blathers
sardonically. “I remember him getting those
receipts four years ago.”
THE CLOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I used to think if you should scan
All ages for the greatest man
From Adam’s period down,
Without a doubt —it seemed to me—
The greatest man must surely be
The painted circus clown!
I hung upon the words he spoke;
I laughed at every thrilling joke,
When I was only ten.
I longed like him to leap and vault
Or turn a double somersault,
This paragon of men.
I saw him once again last night,
But, as I watched, no glamorous light
Shone round his powdered head.
His voice seemed raucous when he spoke,
I yawned at every stale old joke
And wished that it was dead.
But there beside me, rocked with glee,
Sat one who took his life from me,
My boy of only ten;
And though the years I’d wandered through
Gave me a hardened cynic’s view,
The painted clown was still, I knew,
The paragon of men.
VICTORIA.

R PIVUS
Why we claim that
rex-pye
is the finest meat in the world.
1. The tin itself is unique. It is
the perfectly hygienic con-
tainer, stamped out, seamless,
and hermetically sealed, with-
out solder (lead) or soldering
flux.
2. The meats (raw materials) are
the very finest quality obtain-
able.
3. The spicing by a recipe in our
sole possession and the exce..-
lent jelly help to produce the
delicious flavor characteristic
of REX-PYE.
4. The cooking en casserole re-
tains all the juices and food
values.
Thus we account for that delicate
aroma as you open the tin, and
that delicious flavor when the
dainty is eaten.

Lothian : Too late: we’ve buried the Burns
controversy a hundied fathoms deep....X. lie: Yes.
. ...E.N.C.: No interest outside your Main-street....
Tuan Itetam: Our dictionary says that “caucus” is
a corruption of an American-Indian word caucawasu,
meaning a council... ,M.C.: Not a fair specimen of
cocky hospitality... .R.It.K.: The only merit in
your “short Australian stories” is their brevity....
M.A.I: You leave much to supposition. Assuming the
boy to be either the sole or one of the next of kin,
his mother —who lias no claim herself —might apply
to the Court to appoint her guardian ad litem, and
to direct that a sufficient allowance be made to her
for his maintenance during minority. The answer
to second question is “No." The mother’s wisest
course would be to consult a solicitor and place the
whole of the facts before him.... Una C. (Boulder,
VV.A.) : The replies were to quite another “Una C.”
. ...Wook: One verse of “Over the Odds” and then
we’ll stop :—-
The knee-short nighties now appear.
Fashion has just decreed it so.
And may they stop there,' for, I fear,
The least bit less would be de trop.
. ...F.M. (Canterbury): The rugged shape and the
change of language are too heavy a burden for the
slight theme.... H.P.W.: Very rough and awkwardly
expressed... .Julian S.: Doesn’t strike u 5.... J.S.D.:
Bright idea. See if you can’t do the verse better... .
M. : Poor, and as thin as the sigh of the last
rose of summer... .8.5. E.: You have a wild, unholy
and unhappy idea of rhyme.... Dottie D.: Sorry,
but it doesn’t get near print... .R.H.M.: Not up
by some distance. .. .J.S.G.: Misses, but there’s
less space between you and the pay-office. .. .K.N.C.:
Do you make it a general rule to bring the groom
into the ballroom to tip him?... .W.H.S.: Doesn’t
make much of a yarn. ...R.J.M.: Shows no observa-
tion. The remarks are just trite.... Sydney G.: The
lover leaves us downcast. .. .F.H.T.: It moves feebly
to an ungrammatical finish.... M.W.L.R.: It’s hard
to see the lady like that, but the verse is not bad of
its kind....C. He: Begins moderately well, but the
slushy finish spoils it.... Robert H. R.: Set to
gently mournful music, it might make a drawing-
room ballad... .Blanc: In spite of the alphabetical
procession down the margin, it is very poor verse.
... .H.V.T.W.; The lines are not strong enough to
carry the idea, v, 1W.E.8.: You haven't told the
yarn C.L., (Roseville) : Not nm.ch in our line;
but you make an incredible thing seem pretty con-
vincing. .. .Marquita; Ordinary little school essay.
There is an absence of fresh observation... .A.E.E.:
Dull little gathering up of commonplaces which, by
the way, are not all true N.D.R.: Said rather
too often.... Ripponlea: The essence of a thousand
melodramas is crammed into the lyric:-
Carrying passengers ’gainst inclement weather
swaddled,
The steamship up the harbor slowly w'addled.
One man, on deck, gazed toward the land.
His both eyes were fiercely glitt’ring, and
His face carried a malignant, grim twist,
in each o’ercoat pocket he clenched a fist.
“Ah, Heaven,” he remarked. “Would that I’d been
sooner!”
And in despair he paced the deck of the scooner.
“But now, alas, an irrevocable” (he stopped) “fate
She has met! And, curse me, I am too late.
Aha, Gilfadden Cowlishaw, if I get you in my clutches
I’ll take my oath,” he said, “I’ll send you round
. on crutches.”
The house was bathed in moonlight upon the open
flat.
Silent save for the squeak of an occasional playful
rat.
A rap on the door! The glimmer of a light.
Then raised voices wafting through the night.
“You? You manifestation of the power of the
Devil!
You confounded cur! What brings you here, Sir
Neville?”
....Stewart T.: It follows a very heavy line of
fooling... .Echap: A letter to this office will reach
him Gunadli; Impossible to tell from the sample.
The verses are p00r.... Henry M.: Horrible yarn
maue on an ancient pattern, and not made well
L.W. (Brisbane): Don’t care for it D.E.E.: The
disjointed howl of the insane fisnerman is rejected.
N. (Clayfield): Not strong enough C.S.:
“Maulia” may be true, but it doesn’t make its
present setting less melodramatic... .5.A.W.8.: Sorry,
the surprise vvon’t work ; the yarns are below stan-
dard. .. . P.M.; Not at all a bad idea, but the Y'erse
is too Yvobbly and weak.... Bellerive: The pathos is
intensified by the dark-blue philosophy of the subse-
quent remarks:—
The death of little Araluen
Was many years ago,
Which hovered o’er the poet till
Time did lay him low.
Within the garden cemetery
Where trees their shadows cast,
The discovery of her neglected mound
Stirred memories of the past.
When the saddened parents realised
Their darling child was Dead.
And in the silence of the night
Did mourn beside her bed.
Life doth glow and waneth—
Like the flicker of a spark,
A secret of the great supreme.
Is our exit in the dark.
. ...R.8.M.: .The fierce attack on “preasts and
parsons” loses force through its vehement disregard
for grammar and metre J.J.8.: There is no
readable yarn there and the writing is p00r....Fu1l
Moon: Not enough interest... .R.8.H.: The narrative
doesn’t stir us... .Ross D.: Moves too heavily.
Tanwarra: Nicely done as far as it goes, but the
capture is too easy and needs a lot of explanation.
. ...M.K.S.: Doesn’t strike us hard enough... .J.J.
(Katoomba) : Not much in “Caprice” R.R.P.: Too
little life in the stories; so the interest sags....
E.D. (Perth): “The Heretic” is not fresh and not
strong and the whole statement is a commonplace....
J.J.B. (Adelaide) : “Lead” is about ten times too
long Jim Me.: The verse has too many staggers
and bumps. .. .H.H. (Thornbury): A poor sort of
rhyme that hashes up obvious things... .W.S.S.:
Horrible.... Bertram I.: The opening stanza is a
repetition of dozens that have been written.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
T.F.: The brain-wave runs a dead-heat with the
drawing. Both are duds.... J.C. (Chicago): One
can’t crawl and the other is due for the undertaker.
. ...8.A.: Inferior drawing of stylish lady seated on
a distorted aquarium... .T.L.: Unfortunately the
night patrol can’t stop you drawing... .S.K.: Labored
joke and drawing down at the heel... .E.G.S.: The
joke is too obscure... .K.G.: The friends of the
lady who had quadruplets are not brilliant conver-
sationalists. .. .R.K.: A pub that would serve those
loafers deserves to have its license cancelled....
B.S1: You can’t make the joke about the Scotchman
who, when asked if he was a mechanic, replied “No,
I’m a Mclntosh,” appear original by changing the
surname.

TO think that ordinary cuts, burns, scratches, etc.,
are of little account and to assume indifference
by allowing them to be neglected for days is always
unwise. The real danger of these troubles lies in
the breaking or damaging of the protective outer
skin and the laying bare of the sensitive flesh to
the poisonous influence of dirt and disease germs.
When an accident happens you need help
quickly and Zam-Buk is always the safest and most
reliable antiseptic first-aid to have handy. This
healing balm takes all immediate danger out of
minor skin injuries or wounds. It destroys disease
germs, draws off poisonous matter, soothes pain,
and quickly ends a peril which even healthy people
have to face.
Zam-Buk, the world-famous healer, costs you
little more than a box of ordinary ointment —it
gives twenty-fold in soothing, healing and antiseptic power. Whether
it is a cut hand, scratched arm, burned finger, sprain or open wound,
Zam-Buk ensures the utmost safety with clean, perfect healing.
Sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers, 1/6 and 3/6 per box.
The proprietors’ complete faith
in their renowned balm is
shown in that they are pre-
pared to send readers and their
friends a trial sample of Zam-
-11 ut abfollitely free of charge.

Edison Records
mean
Real Music.
The realism of Edison records is incredible. Their music is alive,
bringing the artist mto your home in all save physical presence.
The perfection of Edison music has been publicly proved more
than six thousand times in test recitals at which artists sing or
play in direct comparison with their Edison records. No other
phonograph dares this drastic test of quality.
If you have never heard an Edison record a surprise awaits you.
Call at any Edison shop, for instance, and hear the new organ
records (amongst them “The World Is Waiting for The Sunrise,’’
“Indian Love Call’’ and “Liebstraum”), the loud and amazing
dance records, the famous operatic tone-test records of Verlet,
Case, Muzio, Zenatello, Ciccolini and other Metropolitan stars.
Start to-day on your Edison library; the records represent the
highest attainment in sound recording.

“All Done”: Nearly 1000 auctioneers man-
age to scratch a living out of knocking down
Victoria. Incidentally, they contribute
£24,000 a year to revenue. There are,
or were, at least two women among the num-
ber, and there are more than 100 petticoatcd
estate-agents. Mostly they bargain at coun-
ters, from motor-car seats and at front doors,
and pay much milder license fees.
* * * *
“Briny Bill” : A curiosity in ship-construc-
tion makes its appearance in Australia in
the Zurichmoor, a vessel with two large cor-
rugations or “blisters” running the full
length of the hull. These blisters not only
give more cargo-space, but it is claimed that
the hollow between them catches the water
and sends it unbroken along to the screw.
The innovation and the vessel’s superheated
engines give the aquatic novelty a saving of
tons of coal per day.
* # # #
“Wandi”: What is the highest price paid
for a red cedar-tree? A few years ago a
standing tree in the Atherton scrub (N.Q.)
fetched £250. The purchaser, after felling
and sawing it into lengths, had to cut a bul-
lock-track through the jungle to haul the logs
out. Another tree from the same scrub,
after being cut up, realised £4OO. Red cedar
is much more valuable now, and a giant like
the big scrubs of the Richmond and Tweed
rivers produced would be worth a little for-
tune to the lucky owner.
* It * *
“C.Q.”: Prof. Dubble, of the U.S.A. Car-
negie Institute, comes to light with a state-
ment that investigators are seriously at work
trying by mearfs of detectors, probably of the
thermionic valve variety, to trap heat waves
with the object of broadcasting them in place
of ordinary fuel. The householder will re-
ceeive them through the air just as he re-
ceives broadcasted coon songs and will be
able to cook his chops and fill his liot-water
bag without paying a visit to the woodheap.
If the Professor’s notion comes to anything
there should be a new industry for places
like Bourke and Marble Bar.
* * * *
“The Chaffeuse”: Some motor accidents
are responsible for injuries which are not
covered by the most comprehensive insur-
ance policy. My friend Whosit leaped from
his overturning flivver just in time to escape
damage, but the shock of the smash affected
him so much that he dreamed it over again
every night for five nights, jumping from the
bed with a piercing scream about each 1 a.m.
On the fifth night his leap was badly timed
and he broke his leg; but the insurance office
has explained that the policy covers real
accidents, not dream crashes.
* * * #
“Londoner”: I continually hear women
talking disrespectfully of your dried- and
tinned-fruits. My wife gets good stuff (in
the main), but she has to pay prices that
are beyond most pockets; in fact, most people
refuse to pay more for Empire stuff than for
equal quality from elsewhere. The Aus-
tralian producer badly needs to be told the
truth. The astounding opportunity which
will open out during 1926, and possibly even
1927, as a result of the Empire intensive
propaganda, must not be missed under any
circumstances. It is in these two years that
the Australian fruit-producer will make or
mar his reputation.
* * * *
“Croweater”: Add ragw’ort to the list of
pests that have been turned to good account.
The cockies of Traralgon (Vic.) have long
been looking sideways at the pretty weed
which has spread so rapidly of late years
in defiance of all efforts to check it. Some
time ago the Lands Department borrowed a
block in the infested district and applied the
usual methods, but to no purpose. The
other day the same authority trucked 700
jumbucks with their ribs sticking through
their frames to Traralgon. Twenty of the
crusaders were so poor that they fell by
the wayside. The remainder set to and in
two months cleared the block of its noxious
invader. Incidentally they got as fat as
butter. Yet the handsome but evil-smelling
plant has the reputation of being repulsive
to grazing cattle and of causing a fatal dis-
ease of the liver when eaten.
» * * *
“W.E.D.”“What constitutes a record
yield per acre for any kind of crop in Aus-
tralia?” asks “Moe” (B. 24/12/’25). He
cites some strawberry-growers at Warrnam-
bool making as much as £3BO an acre in a
good season. Let me weigh in with my little
lot. Off rather more than three-quarters of
an acre of cherries in Argyle (W.A.) in
1922 I took £290; in 1923 the yield was
£372, individual trees giving as much as
£l5 each. As the expenses and labor at-
tached to gathering and packing cherries are
considerably less than those for strawberries,
I imagine my yield would return a bigger net
cheque. What constitutes a record for an
Australian orchard on a bigger scale? Off
35 acres of apples, pears, oranges, cherries,
plums, peaches, apricots, lemons, loquats, nec-
tarines and quinces in 1925, my account sales
from the markets, local, English and Euro-
pean, showed a gross return of £3322, or
about £95 per acre.

“Sturt”: South Aus. has suddenly revolu-
tionised the State Bank which it founded
over 30 years ago, and which has long been
mainly a vehicle for financing the building
of homes for soldiers and others. It now
becomes an “Agricultural Bank,” empowered
to divide its forces into an agricultural
branch and another for advances-for-liomes.
Three of the present Board go out at once,
with compensation—the veteran financier
H. D. Gell (chairman) ; Alfred Wells, an
architect; and Brig.-Gefi. Dean, an authority
on land and stock. Stuckey, the State’s
Under-Treasurer, only lately appointed to it,
remains. The neAV men, all members of the
civil service, are Field, chairman of the Irri-
gation Commission; Messent, Secretary of
Lands; Summers, head of the Loans to Pro
ducers Committee; and Sincock, the old
pressman who for many years has been sec-
retary to the railways and other Parliamen-
tary "committees. It is understood that they
will carry ou tiieir present duties iu addi-
tion*

Studebaker
Standard Six Coach
£499.
This fine Studebaker Coach
oAt a "One Profit” Price
The most powerful car of its size and
weight fully machined crankshaft
.... full size balloon tyres .... clock,
petrol gauge on dash; light control on
steering wheel.... these and many
other features are offered in this
Studebaker Standard Six Coach—at a
low price—simply because it is built
complete in Studebaker factories.
Because Studebaker makes all its
own bodies, engines, steering gears,
clutches, gear boxes, differentials,
springs, axles, grey iron castings and
drop forgings in its own great fac-
tories, the profits of outside parts and
body makers are eliminated. Savings
thus effected are returned to the pro-
duct in better materials and finei;
workmanship— at a lower price.
As a result of the production of all
vital parts under one supervision,
Studebaker cars function as a unit, for
all parts are perfectly coordinated.
This results in longer life, greater rid-
ing comfort and higher resale value.
As a natural outgrowth of One-Profit
Manufacture and Unit-Built construc-
tion, a third great advantage to the
buyer is attained —“No Yearly Mod-
els.” Because all phases of manufac-
ture are directly under Studebaker
control, Studebaker cars are constant-
ly kept up-to-date. Improvements are
continually made not saved up
for spectacular announcements which
make cars artificially obsolete. Resale
values of all Studebaker automobiles
are thus stabilized.

If any illustration in “THE BULLETIN” takes your fancy, write
to the MANAGER, who will quote you price for the origina.
“ELK.” : The first native-born Australian
lawyer was G. R. Nichols, a son of Isaac
Nichols. Born on September 27, 1809 tne
year his father was appointed the colony s
first postmaster—he was in Bug"
land. Returning to Sydney in 1823, he was
articled to W. H. Moore, Crown Solicitor,
and admitted to practice on July 1,18 b-
u 1840 he became part proprietor of the
Australian newspaper : eight years later
was elected to the Leg. Council, and held the
seat until he died in 1857.
Theodore, the reject of Herbert (Q-)>
broke a long silence by making wliat a Labor
paper describes as “one of his fighting
speeches on the plute press.” The oration,
it seems, “bristled with clever sentences;
‘when the press grew in affluence it grew m
influence,’ is an epigram of golden hue.
Conversely, when a well-advertised Labor
leader grew in affluence his influence waned
—so much so that he lost what he had
reckoned the softest of snaps. The worst ot
“epigrams” is that they are apt to turn on
their owner, like an ungrateful hound.
“Stellsby” : War widows are still “putting
it over” Repat. The other day Knight, I'.M.,
remarked in Melbourne City Court: “These
women will have to be imprisoned if they
do not stop the practice.” The female who
inspired the threat was a widow who re-
married in October, '2l, without notifying
Repat. Her pension should have ceased in
September, ’23, but she carried on as a widdy
and drew a dishonest £205 before she was
detected. A hard-luck story was told on the
woman's behalf; but the Bench didn’t weep.
It imposed a fine of £5, with £3 ss. Od. costs,
lenient enough in the circumstances.
“Sol. Malaprop” : I wish I knew the ad-
dress of the bureau which seizes on the dis-
tinguished visitor and tells him to be stunned
immediately after landing at our boundless
resources and to be flabbergasted at our
scenery, whether he has seen it or not, be-
cause we are a childlike folk and expect to
be cracked up. The monotony of these dis-
tinguished visitors can’t be accidental. Thus
Allenby said that, as Sydney was so large, the
country at the back of it must be a fertile
region with a great future. And Allenby is
quite old enough to know that you can’t
judge the size of the dog by the flea.
“Bids” : The distribution of the Wembley
“honors” called forth a growl of dissatisfac-
tion even from the loyal Brisbane Coubieb.
It was generally expected that Joyce, who
did the organising work for the Queensland
pavilion and spent thousands of his own
money, would be included; but he was passed
over, with the other pioneers—Orchard, of
N.S.W.; Gepp, of Tasmania; and Nathan,
of W.A. —in favor of two late-comers, Lee
Neil, of Melbourne, and Justly Rawlings, of
Sydney. The Coubieb finds the reason for
the preference in the fact that both Lee Neil
and Rawlings are connected with big drapery
establishments whose support is valuable to
Mr. Bruce. Even a Labor paper couldn’t
say anything nastier than that.
“Nakhoda”: The cost of supplying Mel-
bourne with water is heavy, the loan debt
of the Board of Works over this job being
£15,500,000 up to June 30 last. None the
less it is a thrifty Board, and the disclosure
of one piece of economy for which it claims
credit has been making some people feel a
bit qualmish. The water with which Mel-
bourne Botanic Gardens are kept fresh and
green is carefully locked up; but thirsty
visitors have been in the habit of breaking
the taps or turning them on by means of
spanners. Some of those who read the other
day that this water is obtained from the
Yarra at a point where the dead cats most
do congregate are feeling those cats quite
distinctly.
Captain John Macartliur gets almost all
the credit for having started Australia in
the sheep-raising business, but the Rev.
Samuel Marsden, Chaplain-General of N.S.W.
in the early days, did his bit, too, although
he was out more for mutton than fine wool.
About 1797 Captain Waterhouse brought
some merino sheep to Sydney from the Cape
of Good Hope, and the Rev. Samuel bought
some of them, by 1805 had a decent flock
of his own, and could boast that his sheep,
instead of being “covered with hair,” now
carried fleeces of good quality. Another
great but not practical flockmaster of much
later years was Bishop Tyrrell, erstwhile of
the see of Newcastle and of Brenda station.
The Bishop’s earthly estate, when realised,
ran into six figures.
“Seebee”: A few days after Lord Car-
michael, just gone aloft, was appointed Gov.
of Vic. in 190 S, lie called at the Agency-
General to see John Taverner, who was then
the State’s figurehead in London. The at-
tendant kept him dangling about till he got
impatient. “Can’t I go in yet?” asked Car-
michael. “I saw a gentleman pass in just
now, although I was here before him.” “But,”
protested the janitor in an awed voice,
“that’s the Right Honorable Henry Weedon,
Lord Mayor of Melbourne.” “Is that all?”
said Carmichael. “Then you go in and say
that the Governor-Designate of Victoria is
waiting.” In 10 seconds Carmichael was
in Taverner’s room, and Weedon had van-
ished through another door. Carmick told
Taverner how he had stirred up his messen-
ger, and said he thought “Designate” was
the magic word that had done the trick.
Now all three have gone—Weedon and Tav-
erner, as well as Carmichael.
“Schnorrer”: A Hebrew philanthropist
of an unusual sort is Bernhard Baron, who
brought up the total of his gifts to chari-
ties and his employees to £200,000 by
handing out £50,000 to celebrate his 75th
birthday in December. He made a sort of
apology for having so much money to give
away by describing himself as “a very simple
man, a member of the Labor party”—he
gave it £5OOO last October —“not a sporting
man, and not keen on society,” and hoped
that his gifts to Jews and Christians alike
“would create a link in a keener realisation
of the brotherhood of man.” Baron, born
in Russia, got to America when 16, and
worked in the tobacco trade as a bench-mate
of Sam Gompers, who till his death was one
of Baron’s friends. His fortune was founded
on the invention of a cigarette-making
machine and the formation of the Carreras
Company. His way of living and his friend-
ship with Labor men—Clynes, Ramsay Mac-
donald, J. H. Thomas and Henderson are
amongst his intimates —disarm the usual
suspicions attaching to large benefactions.

THE NEW BEALE
i
1 Every New Beale that goes into use helps to sell its successors. The more it is played
the greater proof does it give of the superlative quality of the Beale. It lasts far longer
than the 25-years written guarantee. It withstands the extremes of the variable Aus-
tralian climate that play such havoc with most instruments. It is good because it is
built"good.” It stays good because every item in it is the best.
2 In 30 years over 60,000 Beale Pianos have been sold. Here are sixty thousand reasons
— reasons, not inducements — why you should augment the list of satisfied owners.
3 In 1908, Beale Pianos gained every award at the Franco-British Exhibition. And they’re
even better to-day.
What do experts think of the Beale ? They praise it; they honour it by awards. But
they do more. They buy these instruments ! Consider this list:
4 The N.S.W. State Conservatorium — the"University of Music”— purchased 19 New
Beales. These were bought after close scrutiny and keen comparison by the highest
authorities in the land.
5 Thirty Beales are in use at the Presbyterian Ladies’ Colleges at Pymbie, Croydon and
Goulburn—bought on the cold, unemotional advice of experts.
6 The Studios of Farmer’s Broadcasting Station, 2 F C, have been equipped for the past
eighteen months with Beale Pianos, in horizontals, uprights and players.
7 Leading musicians of the State — Lindley Evans, Andre Skalski, E. Bennett North,
Frank Hutchens, Henry Penn, G.Vern Barnett—perform on or own New Beales. And
8 Her Majesty Queen Mary purchased at Wembley Exhibition a Beale piano for
Buckingham Palace. In a letter to the London representative of Beale 8C Company,
the Queen’s Treasurer stated : "Her Majesty is much pleased with the tone of the in-
strument, and greatly admires the workmanship of the beautiful case.”
What is it gives leadership to the New Beale ? Why has it sold itself to this long line of
critical buyers—unhampered by money considerations and unlimited in extent of choice ?
It is the amazing "singing” tone of the New Beale—-the rich, liquid, satisfying tone.
Come in and play one of these instruments yourself — in complete privacy.
" Let the New Beale sing to you.”

The Pallid Cuckoo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cuckoo, be stm:
I have my work to do.
In the cool dairy stands the clotted
cream,
Clouding the shallow bowls of willow-blue.
Upon the table waits the silent churn
To cheat me out of ways of idle dream.
The brimming bucket soon must foam and
spill,
The golden loaves within the oven burn.
Cuckoo, be still!
The morn is growing old. Oh, cease your
cry!
Something without my being calls and calls.
I need the open spaces of the sky:
How can I stay between these crowding
walls?
How can I stay when, listening, now I see
The distant hills all drowned in shadowv
haze
And, stretching out to blue infinity,
The yellow-flowered paddock-slopes, ablaze,
hen I can see the shallow silver creek
Bubbling beneath the briar-shaded bridge,
Old quarry-holes that swift sand-pipers seek
And huddling pines along the once-ploughcd
ridge ?
I had forgotten that these things were near
Lntil I heard your singing in my ear.
I had forgotten that I sorrowed so,
0 crymg voice from here and everywhere!
What ails my feet that they are wild to go?
hat madness takes the hot, sweet morning
air?
Tis not for me a bird upon the wing
Ihat flutes above the shaken grass unfurled,
But Love, articulate, beleaguering,
Crying across the ruins of the world !
Ah, wandering voice of love, so hard to find,
falling with soft insistence from afar—
Now close, but out of sight, now fled behind—
And now remote as some faint-singing star.
O bird. 0 love ! O both ! Twin ecstasy !
How you do tear the very heart of me'!
Upon one shining Summer’s day lie came
When all the ears were yellow on the wheat:
His merry tongue made music of my name,
is touch upon my hand was silken-sweet.
And earth seemed lovelier than earth before
p. n ? e } vll ° loved, found favor in his sight—
t odors that the parrot wore,
ihe bloom upon the eucalypt more bright!
Brown-armed he stood among the golden hay,
Brown-armed he walked behind his clanking
in th ® , ni ? ht down by the creek we lay
And watched the broken water-moons
a-dream....
Urnm w , oman ’s eyes are red and sore
hrom staring down the path lie’ll take no
more!
Cuckoo, be still J
1 have m y w ork to do.
HioV only .wring my hands and weep.
wL™ Ung Volce - ls , callin S from the blue
" here yau , are Poised awhile ’twixt earth
and sky.
0 Jesus Christ, there is no love to keep!
1 here is no love, no love that is not ill!
Uh, let me die! I only want to die!
Cuckoo, be still!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Queen Regent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is only owing to the fact that the re-
markable woman whose story is about
to be related died some twenty-five years
ago that the writer dares to tell it at all.
In her lifetime he would no more have con-
sidered the possibility of doing so than of
burgling the Sydney Safe Deposit or blow-
ing up the High Court. Either of these
nsky undertakings would have been better
worth trying than to have put Mrs. John
(obb-Bennet into print during the year when
she was still above ground.
And even though she has rested for more
than two decades beneath a granite monu-
ment weighing approximately a ton and a
half, he still hesitates. One is almost fear-
ful that she might arrange a re-incarnation
of herself.
One only knew her, of course, in the latter
years of her life—when she was a magnifi-
cent, benevolent and humorous old lady, with
a caustic tongue and not unkindly heart. But
e something to have known at all one
01 the most remarkable people of the nine-
teenth century, so far as Australia is con-
cerned. She was not only a great lady—
she was a great personality, without any
legard to the limitations her sex might have
imposed upon her. Old Jack Robertson—
ciT John of the ’6l Land Act—who was an
intimate friend, said of her once in his
snuffling, nasal, emphatic fashion: “Damme
r-slies a perfect old devil! The best man
t ever knew—even if she pretends to be a
Woman.” Which was very high praise from
John Robertson. She was a very beautiful
•Londoner—a Miss Julia Cobb—the only
daughter of a canon of St. Paul’s, whom the
tailure of a bank in the city had ruined
dnd killed. She was only 18 when she
came to Sydney, as a governess in the family
of his Excellency Sir George Gipps, at Gov-
ernment House, whence she almost imme-
diately eloped with a Captain Mallow, of the
oUth Regiment, one of the Governor’s aides-
de-camp, whom, since he was an utter black-
guard, a swindler, a drunkard and a general
she divorced in a couple of years.
If I had not been rid of that fellow,” she
s reported to have said long afterwards, “I
mink I should have killed him.” Which
those who knew her well did not doubt she
'vould have been quite capable of doing. For
he was a very bad egg indeed, and had given
her great provocation. Divorce was not so
Lisy in those days as it is now, but she had
Succeeded in getting her freedom.
The hyphenated name dates from 1847,
when she made Mr. William Bennet, of Ben-
net Hills station, on the Gay River, adopt
it, as one of the several conditions under
which she consented to engage herself to
marry him. She did this in the following
year—and there may be said to have taken
place the Revolution of 1848, so far as Ben-
net’s Hill was concerned. After she came
to the Gay River run as its mistress, there
was not much thfft remained as it was before.
It is only the day before yesterday—that
is to say, three generations—since all the
Gay River valley was a forest, and there was
not a fence two miles long between Port
Hunter and the Gulf of Carpentaria. When
not even mail-coaches ran across the river
flats and through the spurs and foothills of
the Liverpool Ranges to the valley of Page’s
River. When the wheels of bullock-drays
furrowed the only ruts across Patrick’s
Plains, and Ravensworth, Segenhoe, St.
Helier’s and St. Aubins and along the King-
dom Ponds Creek. When the Queen’s Writ
did not run beyond the northern boundary
of the Nineteen Counties, above Murrurundi.
When gangs of convicts toiled on the break-
water between Newcastle and the old Coal
Island, or made the road to Wallis Plains.
When country society was divided sharply
into the bitterly antagonistic classes of Free
Settlers and Emancipists. When the world
was three generations younger than it is to-
day—and was still the same old world. It
is not really so long since then; and yet
those days are already half-hidden in the
mists of forgotten things that are nowhere
written in any records.
Bennet Hills station is not so much “hills’’
as a fertile valley in the Upper Hunter shire,
watered by that pleasant tributary of the
main stream which was named after Mr.
Assistant-Surveyor Gay. The valley runs
almost north and south from the eastern
edge of the New England tableland, taking
a turn westward as it approaches the Hunter.
It lies between long blue lines of ranges, and
the old station liomeste'ad, solid and four-
square, is situated, apparently, immediately
below the massive heap of tree-clad rock and
earth that the blackfellows used to call Woo-
rooma. It is in reality five miles away from
it, but when you are driving out to the sta-
tion from the railway, and top the last rise
before you come into the home paddocks, the
great blue, flat-crested mountain almost
seems to overhang the house and outbuild-
ings. It is 5000 feet high, and from its level
summit, on clear days, you may see the faint
line of the Pacific horizon opposite Port
Stephens. In between the big mountain and
the sea lies a' complex wilderness of tumbled
ranges, almost as wild and primeval still as
when Captain Cook passed up the coast,
northward bound, in 1770.
A beautiful little river is the Gay, twist-
ing and bending through an arcade of she-
oaks sixty miles long, as it meanders down
the twenty miles or so of its watershed. Rich
alluvial flats stretch away from its deep
chocolate banks, and perhaps it may only
rightly be termed a creek, or a brook, or a
rivulet, for in no place could you row a
boat along it for 200 yards. Deep water-
holes alternate with singing shallows, where
the rippling music of sparkling rapids accom-
panies the gentle sighing of the oak-trees, all
day and all night long, in the sweetest music
ever made.
Sometimes the shady river foams into a
raging torrent of muddy waters that surge
out over the flats—and then there are floods
in the Lower Hunter, and Maitland asks for
boats, and the dirty water stains the blue
ocean off Newcastle. Sometimes it is only
a series of waterholes, unconnected by rip-
pling fords —and wdien it is like that the
flats are cracked and gaping, and the green
hills have become brown, and there is the
very devil of a drought in other parts of
New South Wales. But the Gay Valley is
most commonly a beautiful, rich pasture,
where the grass is deep and sweet, the cattle
fat, and the sheep clad in the very best of
embyronic tweed.
That is the country the Queen Regent
came to rule over in 1848. though it w r as not
for several years—until after the event about
to be recorded —that she came into her title.
* * * *
From her wedding day Mrs. Cobb-Bennet
took the reins into her own hands, and drove
the Cobb-Bennet coach with an efficiency and
courage that were truly admirable. When
her husband —an easy-going, gentlemanly
nonentity—was killed, five years later, leav-
ing her with a son and two daughters, she
was quite easily capable of managing the
station and all w T ho had to do with it.
The first, and most startling, of her inno-
vations and changes when she came to
Bennet Hills as a not altogether inexperi-
enced bride was her immediate abolition oi
convict labor on the estate. “Prison labor
is no good,” she said, “and I don’t like the
look of it. This Australia is going to be
the freest country in the w T orld —whatever
it may be now—and I will not be either
a slave-driver or a dupe. If you want to
get hard work and plenty of it out of these
people you've got to flog ’em—and I am not
a cat with nine tails. If you don’t force
’em to work, they regard you as easy, and
you become their dupe. I’m sure the old
Canon”—she w r as fond of referring to her
father as a ghostly arbiter of conduct —“I’m
sure he wouldn’t like it. I will make this
place pay with the assistance of free men,
not by the servitude of slaves. No —it is
no use your protesting, William, my love,
lou know very well that I’m doing the right
thing, and I desire no argument about it.”
That is what she said to her husband,
she told me herself, 50 years afterwards,
with many impressive nods of her wise old
head. She made him apply for the tickets-
of-leave of all the assigned servants on the
place, and those whom the authorities would
not indulge with the favor were returned to
Hyde Park Barracks. Those who remained
upon the station were immediately placed
upon the wages-book.
Many of her contemporary landed propri-
etors were protesting against the abolition
of convict transportation, saying that it
meant ruin to the country. “Liars!” she
cried contemptuously. “It is only their own
pockets they are thinking of. They care no
more for the future of this splendid country
than they do for the back side of the moon.

As has been mentioned above, her very
worthy but completely overshadowed hus-
band was killed in 1 852. when the bush-
rangers stuck up the station and made the
name of Mrs. Julia Cobb-Bennett ring from
Moreton Bay to Adelaide, and from Sydney
to Fremantle, because of the gallant defence
that the undaunted lady put up, and her
capture of the leader of the gang.
It was a curious body of freebooters that
Saunders Macdonald organised in '52 —quite
unlike the runaway-convict sort of bush-
ranger who had been driven into outlawry
by the harshness of the assignment system,
pr the flash gold-escort expei’t who took the
stage gratuitously after the diggings had
broken out. Saunders was a red-headed
cattle-stealer who came of many generations
of border reivers in Berwickshire, operat-
ing amongst the farms of Cumberland and
Northumberland in the Old Country, and
although he had been transported when he
was but 17 for the hereditary failing, his
voyage oversea had no more cured him of
cattle-lifting propensities than a dog is
cured of a liking for meat by being fed for
a month on pollard.
There is no doubt that Saunders regarded
himself as a persecuted being. He was only
a cattle-dealer —other people pronounced it
“stealer” —who found unbranded calves and
put his own mark upon them and sold them
down in Maitland. Somewhere up on the
high tableland of the' "Tomalo Tops, that
runs into '** w England from the head of the
Hunter, he had a big stockyard, and thence,
with his two half-caste/ sons—Jimmy the
Devil and Tommy thiT Liar—and a...few
blackfellows lie conducted a sort of war on
all the cattle-stations of the Upper Hunter,
tlie Liverpool Plains and New England. He; had
his agents all over tljre country, and waS in
a flourishing way of business when too much
attention began to be attracted to his opera-
tions, mainly owing to what he regarded as
the uncalled-for hostility of the mistress of
Bennet Hills.
That strenuous young woman —-20 she
whs then, and there was nothing of ladylike
mid-Victorian languor about the handsome
Julia —swore a warrant against Saunders
Macdonald for cattle-stealing from Bennet
Hills, took two of her own stockmen and a
mounted policeman from Scone, and followed
Saunders up the Hunter, clad in riding-
breeches and thigh-boots, her husband being
absent at the diggings near Bathurst, whither
curiosity, rather than enterprise, had led
him.
They came up with the cattle-stealers a
little way above the junction of Stewart’s
Brook arid the main river, and exchanged
shots. One of licr men was badly wounded,
and she was compelled to draw off in order
to try to get the casualty to where he could
receive medical attention. He died at Bell-
trees, on the way into Scone; so Saunders
and his two hopeful offspring became
“wanted” for murder.
“And they won’t he wanted long, said
Mrs. Julia grimly, “ —if I have anything to
do with it.”
She went down to Maitland and inter-
viewed that redoubtable I\M. Mr. Edward
Denny Day, having very little faith in the
energy of the local magistracy and their
somewhat inefficient police. That veteran
of Wellington's campaign in the Peninsula
and Mrs. ('obb-Bennet planned and executed
a campaign against Saunders and his gang
which made life a burden to the harassed
Scot. They burnt his hut on the Toir*lo
Tops and cut down his stockyards. They
chased him into the wild country between
the source of the Hunter and the sea. Mr.
Day mustered all his quarry’s cattle and
sold them in Muswellbrook, paying compen-
sation from the proceeds to those who could
prove he had robbed them.
It is little wonder that Saunders Mac-
donald became vindictive. “All’ll bur-rn th’
hoose at yon Bonnet Hills,” he swore, “an’
chase yon carline body, naked, wi’ a stock-
whip.”
Two days after her husband’s return from
the Bathurst side one of the stockmen came
galloping into the homestead at sunset with
word that Saunders and his sons were in
the neighborhood.
The present four-square homestead of
stone had just been completed—it is the
centre of the house as it is now—and she
hastily garrisoned it with three or four men
about the place who had not levanted to the
all-devouring goldfields, barricaded the doors
and windows of the ground floor with furni-
ture and mattresses, leaving loopholes to
fire through, and prepared to give her bitter
adversary battle.
Saunders had with him Jimmy the Devil
and Tommy the Liar and three .blackfellows.
He had the impudence to ride up to the
front of the house and demand its surrender.
“All’ll spare y’r lives. Mistress—but ah’m
gaun for tae bur-rn doon th’ hoose. ’Tis
but joostice for what ye hae done tae me.”
A spit of red flame from a front window and
the whistle of a bullet over his head con-
vinced Saunders that his mild terms were
rejected.
“That’s your answer, Macdonald, my man !”
Her contralto voice rang without a tremor
through the still night.
“Ye —!” shouted Saunders, for-
getting his manners. “Ah’ll tak ye tae th’
moontains for yon !”
Then ensued a fusillade that lasted for
more than an hour. Hardly a quarter of the
time had gone by when kindly, easy-going
William Cobb-Bennet lay stretched in a
slobber of blood on the new drawing-room
carpet, the back of his head carried away
by a heavy bullet from a Brown Bess musket.
His pale but unfaltering widow bent over
his corpse, a candle in one hand and a horse-
pistol in the other. “He’ll hang for that!”
she muttered. “And I’ll go to see it done.”
About 10 o'clock Saunders Macdonald,
Ivina prone on his belly behind a yellow-
jacket tree beyond the lawn, wondering
vaguely whether it would not be wise to
raise the siege—indeed he confessed after-
wards that lie had been just about to call
his forces off—felt the cold barrel of a pistol
behind his right ear. None of his men
were near him. ’1 in standing on your gun,
Macdonald. Cry out to your men to draw
off or you're a dead man.”
Saunders looked up, and recognised by the
light of a half-moon that his gods had be-
trayed him into the hands of his implacable
enemy. Mrs. Julia’s whisper had been
hardly audible, but he recognised unmistak-
ably that it conveyed no idle threat. He
was a brave man, but the odds were against
him.
“Don’t utter a sound,” she whispered,
“save to tell your men to withdraw. Tell
them you’ve had enough. If you do not do
so by the time I count live I will kill you.
I mean it, Macdonald.”
Below her breath, but so that he could
hear —and she emphasised each numeral she
uttered by a soft kick of a pointed shoe
in Saunders’s ribs —she began to count.
'‘One—two — three — four”
In a quavering voice he cried out : “Tom,
Jimmy ! Back tae th’ We’re not
strong eneuch for them.”
“Tell them to ride away.” she whispered,
“and that you’ll catch them up. Quick,
now!”
“Be off wi’ ye, boys. I’H owertak' ye.”
Five minutes later he was securely trussed
up to a chair beside the dead body of the
dauntless lady's husband.
“Wumman,” said Saunders, i.witli admira-
tion in his rough voice, “ye're a brave lass.
Nae doot All’ll swing for this —an’ ’tis a
sair thing for to be taken by a bit lassie- —
but. Ma’am, I dae ye honor.”
To Mr. Day, when he met that gentleman
at the Sessions House in Maitland, he paid
further tribute to his captor. “Yon she-
deevil bewitched me,” he told him. “Ah
couldna do naucht but what she ordered.
Losli, yon’s a brave lassie. Ali’m dootin’
her niithcr was frae th’ hielands. Quid
luck to her. Ye could ha’ done no better
yersel, Denny Day. Nor any ither mon.”
On the sunny morning when they were
about to hang Saunders outside the gaol on
the hill at East Maitland a veiled lady in a
black habit rode a big bay horse close to
the outskirts of the crowd. She drew rein
there, and watched through the veil the hang-
man and his mafe busy about their grisly
preparations. When Saunders mounted the
steps of the scaffold and stood, pinioned,
upon the drop, with the unhappy chaplain
beside him, she lifted her veil.
“Ood Jin' mercy!” gulped Saunders, the
rope about his neck, as he recognised her.
There was a tense silence, broken only by
the carolling of a magpie in the trees below,
and then by the voice of Mrs. Cobb-Bennet
—clear, and firm and sad.
“May God forgive you. Saunders Macdon-
ald !” She wheeled her horse and rode away.
That was the kind of woman she was —
she who came to be called the Queen Regent.

Sweet it was;with softened footfalls
Slow to pass.
Fine it was to hear the magpies,
Fine to hear the plover’s call,
While the wild hops by the trackside
Scented all.
Stirred by breezes swayed the tree-tops,
Gold sun-lances slanting through,
While, wings flashing, hither, thither,
Parrots flew.
All around towered stately gumtrees,
Flesh-hued in the early light,
Opening out in haunted vistas
Left and right.
Stretching far those vistas wandered
Roofed with green and floored with green,
Haunted seemed they by strange beings
Dimly seen.
Here and there shy bushland creatures,
Keen of ear and quick of eye,
Hearing footfalls on the dry leaves
Sounding nigh,
Like grey shadows through the bracken
And the tall grass swiftly leapt;
Here and there on log and boulder
Lizards slept.
Sometimes gliding through dead timber,
Deadly, beautiful and grim,
Passed a snake from shine to shadow,
Swift and slim.
Sometimes sounded bells and hobbles
Down the soft, sweet-scented air,
Sometimes rose a thrush’s music
Rich and rare.
Often, galloping, a horseman
Cracked his wdiip as on he sped,
Seeking cattle, straying cattle,
Far ahead.
Often, dry of throat and thirsty,
I would pause beside some pool,
Deeply drinking of its waters,
Clear and cool.
Gone is now the slab-walled school-room,
Gone the care-free hours of old ;
Gone the warnings made of azure,
Green and gold.
Gone youth’s glory! Yet, at moments,
To that long, hop-bordered track,
Green of gum and gold of wattle
Call me back.

The Most Efficient Mower on Earth,
THE
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2J-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
Printed matter supplied with pleasure on application.
