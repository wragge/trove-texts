Contemporary Science.
The development of the theory of evolution, that grand conception which unites
all phenomena in one splendid synthesis under uniform law, regains the most attrac-
tive feature of contemporary science. From year to year the hypothesis is altered
in its details, but its general truth becomes always clearer, and those who now reject
it do so only by impugning the quality of their intellect. It is not as if there were
rival theories of defensible validity. All the facts point one way. For creation or
emanation there are assumptions and presumptions innumerable, but not a vestige
of ponderable proof. For evolution there is all the proof that is. Its chain of evi-
dence may not be complete ; the links that are wanting have probably been lost for
ever, but sufficient remain to amply justify the general judgment of scientists.
Sporadic objectors, like Lord Salisbury, doubtfully suggesting the argument for
design to the consideration of the British Association; or Mrs. Besant, confidently
compaiing the weakness of inductive logic with the sweet reasonableness sweated
from the swoons of a Master-Mahatma, are mere retrograde ripples swallowed in the
advancing tide of thought. Lord Salisbury’s cavil that physicists and biologists
cannot agree as to time available and time demanded for the processes of
evolution, gives ground for believing that either physicists or biologists, or
both, are in error; but affords no basis for postulating supernatural inter-
ference with observed uniformity of natural law. Mrs. Besant’s quotation of
Weismann as denying the perpetuation of acquired structural variations, and of
Huxley ms admitting that ethical advance is opposed to the scheme of natural
selection, is a pleasant irrelevancy of the platform. Neither Weismann nor Huxley,
as Mrs. Besant might add at future lectures, has the least idea that the evolu
tionary theory is weakened by their admissions. It is only modified. Weismann
simply shifts the load from natural selection to sexual selection; and Huxley, while
re-stating the tiuism that altruism is opposed to egoism, recognises as a matter of
course that both altruism and egoism join rhythmically in evolutionary unity.
The tendency of current thought is to show that the individual is in the plan
of existence as nothing compared with the race—that the most complex individual
lives are, in Fosters phrase, “but the bye-play of ovum-bearing organisms.” Here
again evolution comes directly into conflict with Oriental creeds which lay stress or.
the need for purification of the Ego by a short or long course of trial, with a view
to final salvation. More and more clearly is it to be seen that this view is un-
scientific and unwarrantable—the dear delusion of anthropocentric myths which
measure the Atom with the All, and hail him master of a universe where his function
is solely that of a life-bearer, and his identity is a matter of the profoundest cosmic
indifference.
In the “Contemporary Science Series,” a list of which appears below, may be
found the most recent and readable books on evolution, as on many other minor
phases of scientific struggle. Such works as Drummond’s “ Ascent of Man ” and
Kidds “Social Evolution,” written to bolster preconceived theories, cannot compare
in interest and value with a book like “ The Evolution of Sex,” a most masterly
review of a wide and fascinating field. Weismann’s “ Germ-Plasm ”is strong meat
for beginners, and wants some previous training to be appreciated. Lombroso’s
“Man of Genius” and Ellis’s “Criminal” and “Man and Woman” (elsewhere
noted) have special charm for average readers ; but the whole series can be warmly
recommended. Posted for 3s. 9d. each, with exceptions noted.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dander on Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for rem v-
mg all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and xnver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that 1 luue
previously tried. Yours faithfully, 11 lON H V

Baron Berzilius’—
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid lirila
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its e\ acuallon.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dr spepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on ail
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skio
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
. “I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows ;
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking’ two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily oured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costivenefs.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I And these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
O. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeits a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Bow’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

Dear Bulletin.— To the lay Australian
mind, busy land-booming and picking doubles,
the mode of progression of the amorphous animal
known in the bulk as Christianity, seems somewhat
remarkable. The so-called Christian Church has in-
variably opposed all social reforms and decried all
scientific discoveries; it has put down its fat thumb
and said, “We know; this book is the sum of know-
ledge and the source of national greatness; any-
thing more than this is superstition, any less is
infidelity.” But whenever a new craze becomes
popular the Church plumps down on it with the
energy of a verger on a poodle, takes it into its
bosom, gives it a Christian name, accounts for its
sudden appearance by putting a new twist on
some old Hebrew text, and sends round the saucer
on the strength of it more merrily than ever.
About the last thing the Church has appropriated
is Temperance. Christianity is now about 1900
years old, and temperance has only made its
appearance during the last 100. Has the Church
been keeping its temperance up its sleeve for 1800
years? The first thing Noah did when became
out of the Ark was to get drunk and lose his
clothes, and had not the constable Kelly of that
day been accidentally drowned, some six weeks
previously, the chances are that the “ good man
and just ” would have been run in for 24 hours in
Ararat jail. Then Lot, who was especially saved
from the doomed City of Sodom, showed his
thankfulness by getting drunk as soon as he found
himself in a place of safety. (The details of Lot’s
spree are familiar to all Social Purity people.)
In fact, taking the Christian text-book right
through, it seems as if the man who kept drunk at
least eight days a week had the best chance of
heaven. Some day the Church will see money in
the totalizator, and take it unto the fold. She
will tack a tin cross upon it, give it a Christian
name, and make it holy. A little hymn and a
short sermon on such a text as “The race is not
to the swift,” with local allusions to well-known
pullings and scratehings by a parson in full profit,
would give the thing a tone. Then, when the col-
lection and maiden plate go hand in hand, and
the Church in every township embraces a “Young
Men’s Christian Teatotalizator Society,” the
millennium will be nearly due.— Borax.

INDIGESTION

9 CUBED BY USING

Mr. T. J. CLUNE,

“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-

weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
; suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
\A
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of

after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour -
ished with pure blood.

Extract from text:—
The period to be added to the term of a pastoral lease
in consideration of a withdrawal shall be computed so
that the added period shall bear the same ratio to the un-
expired period as the area withdrawn bears to the area
left. The method of ascertaining the added period shall
be by multiplying together the unexpired period and the
area withdrawn and dividing the product by the area left.
For the purposes of computation any fractional part of a
month shall be reckoned as one month, and any fractional
part of an acre shall be disregarded.
Rejoice, illiterate brothers,
Clap large, applausive hands,
For massive-brain’d Carruthers
Sits down to boss the “ Lands ”;
Yet from his old department
No force can tear him free :
For science still and art meant,
He’ll teach the Rule of Three.
His birch he girds with mighty words
To teach you Rule of Three.
O Schoolmaster, in earnest
Thou’rt all “ abroad ” at last;
For wider scope thou yearnest,
Lands infinitely vast —
But mark, good simple folks you.
What tender sympathee
Fills him who soft invokes you—
Then let those fractions be !
“Deal only, sirs, with integers,
And let the fractions be.”
Carruthers, bright Carruthers,
Just take the rest in tow;
Ground in three R’s those others
Who lug portfolio:
Add faith to “ Works,” re-audit
That model Treasuree—
Still, earn our wildest plaudit
For help with Rule of Three.
For grateful pause ’mid dreary laws
To dwell on Rule of Three.
Harry Furness has registered a co. to run
his comic illustrated paper, Lika Joko.
Only four short years ago the Illustrated
Sydney News said, among other fulsome eulogies,
about Matthew Davies : —“ His benevolence keeps
pace with his wealth. . . . He was chosen for
the Speakership more for his genial qualities and
strict integrity of character. . . ~ Not one of
his predecessors ever won more respect on both
sides of the House. . . , He is regarded in
society as absolutely without reproach. He is in
every way a credit to the native-born population,
&c.” Consider the uncertificated Matthew of to-
day, and how does it all read ? It is only one
more evidence that it is unsafe to praise any man
until he is dead. Also, it is better to wait until
he has been dead for a considerable time—say dead. :
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by

tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers

A verse from one of the Melb. Argus
election rhymes:—
See your mother there, boys.
She’s barely in her prime ;
But the gray’s on her hair, boys—
She’s old before her time.
She’s worn her life away, boys,
AH work and no play, boys—
Sixteen hours a day, boys.
For the artisan’s eight-hours’ day.

The following death-sentence is said to
have been actually passed some years ago at Santa
Fe (U.S. A.); —
Jose Maria Martin, stand up. You have been indicted,
tried and convicted by a jury of your own countrymen of
the crime of murder, and the court is about to pass upon
you the dread sentence of the law. As a usual thing,
Jose Maria Martin, it is a painful duty of the judge of the
court of justice to pronounce upon a human being the
sentence of death ; there is something horrible about it,
and the mind naturally revolts from the performance of
such a duty. Happily, however, your case is relieved of
all such unpleasant features. The court takes a positive
delight in sentencing you to death. You are a young
man, Jose Maria Martin, apparently of good constitution
and robust health; ordinarily you might haVe looked
forward to many years of life, and the court has no
doubt you have expected to die of a green old
age ; but you are now about to be cut off in conse-
quence of your own act. Jose Maria Martin, it is
now the spring-time; in a little time the grass will be
springing up green in these beautiful valleys and on these
broad mesas, and on the mountain sides flowers will be
blooming, birds will be singing their sweet carols, nature
will be putting on her most attractive robes ; life will be
pleasant and men will want to stay ; but none of this for
you, Jose Maria Martin. The flowers will not bloom for
you, Jose Maria Martin; the birds will not sing their
sweet carols for you, Jose Maria Martin. When these
things come to gladden the senses of men you will occupy
a space 6x2 beneath the sod, and this grass and these
beautiful flowers will be growing green above your lowly
head. The sentence of the court is that you be taken
from this place to the county gaol; that you be there
safely kept and securely confined in the custody of the
sheriff until the day appointed for your execution—
be very careful, Mr. Sheriff, that he have no oppor-
tunity to escape and that you have him at the ap-
pointed place at the appointed time, until—Mr. Clerk,
what day of the month does Friday, about two weeks
from this day, come ? ‘ March 22nd, your Honor.’—Very
well, until Friday, the 22nd day of March, when you be
taken by the sheriff from your place of confinement to
some safe and convenient spot within the county, and
that you be there hanged by the neck until you are dead.
And the Court was about to add, Jose Maria Martin, may
God have mercy on your soul, but this Court will not
assume the responsibility of asking an allwise Providence
to do that which a jury of your peers has refused to do.
The Lord could not have mercy on your soul. However,
if you affect any religious belief, or if you are connected
with any religious organisation, it might be well for you
to send for a priest, or your minister, and get from him—
well, such consolation as you can, but the Court advises
you to place no reliance on anything of the kind. Mr.
Sheriff, remove the prisoner.”

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1894.
The Financial Straits of Maoriland.
In last issue The Bulletin endeavoured to
sum up a few among the many varieties of
absentee who are constantly draining the
life-blood of the Australasian provinces.
The list of these foreign creditors was very
incomplete; still it was as complete as the
limits of a newspaper article would allow.
It included the Australian property-owner
who spends his rents in England ; the Eng-
lish investor who buys Australian land cheap
and sells it dear ; the English land and rail-
way syndicates, mortgage companies, invest-
ment, loan, discount and other companies ;
the English banks which do business in this
country ; the Australian banks (so-called)
which are largely English ; the English
depositors, debenture-holders, mining specu-
lators, miscellaneous financiers, importers,
insurance co.’s, the English holders of State
securities, municipal securities, harbor-board
securities, and various other kinds of
absentee creditors. Among them all,
these provinces probably owe about
£500,000,000, and have to pay annually in
interest anywhere between £20,000,000 and
£25,000,000. This amount leaves the
country every year, never, by any chance, to
return. It is not—like the interest on the
public debts of France, Britain, the U.S.,
and various other countries—paid to local
creditoi’s, who spend it locally, so that it
goes back again into circulation. On the
contrary, it vanishes utterly out of the
aggregate wealth ot the community, and, so
far as the community is concerned, the loss
is the same as if property to the value of
over £20,000,000 were destroyed by fire
annually. This tremendous drain has to be
met in gold or produce exported, and it is
one cause —probably the main cause—of all
the misery which has descended on Aus-
tralasia in recent years. Land nationalisa-
tion, Single-tax, and kindred theories only
deal with the more equitable distribution of
wealth that is in the country. The great
absentee problem has reference to the dismal
fact that the time is steadily approaching
when there will be but little wealth in the
country to distribute, either equitably or
otherwise.
* * «
The external liabilities of this country con-
sist of the interest due annually to its
multitudinous absentee creditors, and the
price of imports ef all descriptions ; and the
fund out of which this charge is to be met is
made up of the value of all exports, coin and
bullion included. When these two items, so
far as can be estimated, balance, then the
country may be assumed to be paying its
way, or thereabouts. When the imports and
the interest-charges combined—so far as
these interest-charges can be ascertained—
exceed the exports, then Australasia is cer-
tainly running further into debt, and piling
up more interest-charges to be liquidated in
the future. And the lamentable fact is that,
for more than twenty years past, the balance
has invariably been on the wrong side. The
best result yet produced in the year of
bitterest economy was that these provinces
only went a very few millions further to the
bad. So far as can be judged by outward
evidences, they are, under present condi-
tions, unable to pay interest on their external
liabilities out of income, and it is only
because the capital of the foreign absentee
keeps steadily pouring into the country—
either openly through State loans, or secretly
through all manner of private investments—
that the liability is met at all. The lean
times are those in which foreign capital
comes in slowly ; the times of fatness are
those when it comes abundantly. But it
keeps coming all the while.
• • •
So far, only Maoriland has made a serious
effort to abjure the curse of foreign capital,
and the present state of that province is,
therefore, a matter of interest. For a con-
siderable number of years Maoriland has
floated no new loans, save for conversion
purposes only ; and it has done, and is still
doing, everything in its power to prevent
the acquisition of big estates by foreign
speculators, and to discoui’age, in other ways,
the investment of foreign capital—recog-
nising that foreign capital is merely an addi-
tion to the community’s aggregate indebted-
ness to the foreign money-lender, and
another straw added to the enormous load of
interest which goes annually out of the
country. Also, it has done its best, by a
carefully-devised protective tariff, to reduce
the volume of foreign imports and to in-
crease exports, thereby increasing the aggre-
gate annual income on the one hand and
reducing the outgo upon the other. Its
policy has been successful, in a sense, far
beyond the general expectation. The private
liabilities of the province to outside
creditors, as far as can be ascertained, have
remained about stationary. Despite a large
increase of population the imports have
decreased, during the past ten years, by
about £1,000,000 per annum, while the
exports have increased by nearly £3,000,000.
The total exports are now about £2,500,000
per annum more than the total imports,
therefore the province is paying that
amount annually out of its own resources
towards the interest due to the British
creditor. Yet it is almost certain that the
result of all this effort has not in any way
reduced the aggregate indebtedness of the
country ; the most that has been arrived at
is that the debt has not increased. And the
condition of a large proportion of the com-
munity under this strain is described as one
of extreme poverty. It is almost as bad as
that of Australia, and but for the fact that
the Democratic policy which Ballance
inaugurated has shifted a large proportion
of the public burdens on to the shoulders of
the propertied classes, the state of the
Maoriland labourer would now, in all pro-
bability, be several times worse than that of
his brother on the other side of the water.
• • •
The existing condition of things is ascribed,
by the local Conservative press, to the policy
of the Democratic Government—and it is
rightly so ascribed. But, when the Con-
servative press points to it as a proof of the
utter wickedness of the Government and
the folly of its policy, and talks of a good
time coming when the Liberal party will be
overthrown, and Maoriland will boom again
through the investment of foreign capital, it
is either a knave or an ass, or a combination
of both. The Government has simply
brought the province into a condition of
solvency ; and all the existing poverty and
suffering are the inevitable concomitants of
solvency. Maoriland is now facing the day of
reckoning ; and the only way to make an
immediate burst of prosperity out of the exist-
ing materials is to postpone that day by more
public and private borrowing, and to
have a much worse reckoning later
on. Some day or other all these pro-
vinces must cease borrowing, either volun-
tarily, because they have resolved to abjure
the unclean thing, or else compulsorily
because their credit is exhausted and no one
will lend them another coin. Then they
must either live and pay interest on their
foreign liabilities out of their own resources
—or else they must go bankrupt. The diffi-
culty cannot be met by the sale of the rail-
ways, or by any similar expedient. If the
railways are sold it must be to an English
syndicate, because no company could be
formed in Australia with money enough to
buy such a property. And whether Aus-
tralasia has to send to England £8,000,000
i per annum as interest on money bor-
rowed by the State to build the railways,
or whether it has to send the same amount
to the same place as dividends on the capital
put up by English speculators to buy the
lines, the drain on the community is exactly
the same. The only alternative, providing
A ustralasia does not propose to repudiate, is
either to begin living ®n our own resources
now—which means poverty and hard work
and little hope for the future—or to face the
same problem later ©n, which means worse
poverty, and all the other evils in an accen-
tuated form.
• • •
Unfortunately for Maoriland, either the
present Government is too weak for the task
it has undertaken, or else the task itself is
an impossibility ; and a resumption of
foreign borrowing appears as one of the
features of Treasurer Ward’s latest budget.
This is a misfortune in every respect. If
Maoriland had resolutely abjured the curse
of imported capital for ten years more, it
would either have become solvent and
prosperous, or else it would have gone bank-
rupt, In either case it would have settled
decisively whether it is possible for the
Australasian provinces to meet their enor-
mous liabilities honestly or not; as no other
Government seems inclined to make the
attempt this country looked to Maoriland
for the answer to the great conundrum, and
the answer, apparently, is not to be forth-
coming at present, Mr. Ward’s borrowing
policy has this much to recommend it—that
its object is not to add to the aggregate
national burdens, but, by creating a fund
out of which money can be lent on mortgage
at a low rate of interest, to oust the private
foreign usurer; and thus reduce the total
amount of interest payable by the country
at large. But the dismal fact remains that
the good old influx of foreign capital is being
commenced afresh, and no one can foresee
the end of the experiment. If the Seddon
Government had founded its Land Bank
with a capital of, say, £5,000,000 in State
paper currency, that would also have been a
hazardous experiment, but the end of it,
even at the worst, could have been no more
disastrous than foreign borrowing must in-
evitably be. Also, it would have had the
merit of being a self-reliant policy, and
therefore more in keeping with the tradi-
tions of the Radical party. Unfortunately,
the Government lacked the courage required
for so bold an experiment.
* # •
Taking all the circumstances into con-
sideration, the probabilities are that the new
departure was not made from choice—that
it had become absolutely necessary to raise
money, in some shape or form, by internal
or external loans, and that if this had not
been done the province must have filed its
schedule. Leaving out Westralia, which is
yet in a transition state, and can hardly be
used for purposes of comparison, Maoriland
raises more money per inhabitant by
taxation than any of the other Australian
provinces, and it raises by direct taxation
over twice as much as any other, Westralia
included. Its public expenditure is less per
head than that of any other province, Tasmania
excepted ; and its expenditure for purposes
other than interest on the public debt is by
far the least in all Australasia. It has
brought economy down to the lowest imagin-
able limit, and it has piled up taxation to
an extent undreamt of elsewhere. Yet it
became necessary a little while ago to collect
the half-yearly instalment of the Land-tax
four months before the regular date of pay-
ment, in order to meet the interest on the
public debt, and this expedient seems to
suggest that the financial situation was fast
becoming more than serious. There is no
possible reason to believe that these straits
are in any way owing to misgovern ment;
despite all the failings of the Seddon
Government it is still undeniably the best in
Australasia. The whole trouble is that the
burden is too great to be borne, and when
Australia undertakes to face the position—
which she must do sooner or later—she will
go through the same, or probably a worse,
experience. It is not that the country
wants—to quote the good old daily paper
wheeze—to be developed by the aid of
foreign capital; the evil is that the country
has already been developed by foreign
capital, and that the inevitable result has
ensued.
The Latest Aspect of Theosophy.
Colonel Olcott, the blinking greybeard who
visited Australia in ’9l, was content between
blinks to proclaim himself a kind of Theosophic
John the Baptist. There was to come after
him—still between blinks—the lady Messiah
of the new Theosophic dispensation, the big
fish which H.P.B. (reverent blinks) had so
dexterously hooked. Of this high-priestess at
the shrine he, a poor servitor in the temple
(depreciatory blinks), was unworthy to kiss the
garment’s hem. (True, people had said that
Ilcott was not altogether a bug on the wheel
when there was question of rolling the mystic
old chariot along.) Then they owned William
Judge heard of William Judge yes,
he guessed (with many approving blinks) that
William was pretty spry. But Annie
Besant —“ Ah ! you will see ! ” And the
aposiopesis expired in an ecstatic paroxysm of
blinks which threatened to dislocate the
Colonel’s eyelids.
* * *
Well, wo have seen; and the good fore-
runner’s enthusiasm is intelligible. There are
no flies on Annabai. About Olcott himself
there was always hesitation. His beard left a
good impression ; but his blinks undid it. A
saint with shifty eyes is calculated to create
distrust; and the Colonel should really insist
on a better pair next incarnation. As it was
charity forbade to call him a fool, and courtesy
closed the proverbial alternative. Why will
Theosophy impale us on such dilemmas ?
• • •
Mrs. Besant has no beard (even H.P.8., with
all the adepts of the Himalayas behind her
could not grow a beard); but her eyes are
steady. And then she has made her proofs.
Theosophy hasn’t made its proofs, and isn’t
going to. Fact is, it has no proofs to make.
But that doesn’t trouble Theosophy. As
Annabai says: Here are you,\and there is
Theosophy—take it or leave it. Joe Smith
and Joanna Southcott said exactly the same
thing about their doctrines. Every religion
which starts by assuming its own validity has a
knock-down argument in the grand old for-
mula, “ Believe or bedamned !” That Theoso-
phy somewhat spiritualises the doubter’s
alternative is an evident blot on its character.
No creed should commence business without a
comfortable little hell of its town r to grill scep-
tics in. As the hell was carelessly left out of
Theosophy, it can only say, “Believe or
Karma ’ll catch you !” And that is unconvinc-
ing. Karma is so vague.
* * «
Of course, there are other blots ; but none of
them matter if you have Faith and can see
Spooks. The more Spooks you can see the
better Theosophist you are. Annabai (which
is Annie Besant’s alias in Spookland) is justly
severe on the impatient people who wish to see
Spooks as soon as they have paid their sub-
scription. It cannot be too widely known that
the subscription does not include Spooks : they
are always extra. Then you can only see
Spooks on an empty stomach. A person of full
habit, who grows stertorous and apoplectic
ever three flesh-meals daily, is an abomination
to Spooks. Whenever he approaches, they sool
Karma on to him and gather up their skirts in
flight. Why Spooks should wear skirts, seeing
that they have no legs to speak of, isn’t clear.
It is, however, a well-established Theosophic
fact that they do—perhaps because skirts hide
the medium’s hands. Spooks generally accom-
pany certificated mediums; but not always.
You can be your own medium, and see your
own Spook. But it takes a lot of evolving.
That is another blot on Theosophy : there are
no short cuts. You have to evolve a deuce of
a lot before you notice even the whisk of the
tail of a Spook flying round the corner; and,
before you can go flirting round Mountains in
your astral body with other gay Spooks after
church on Sunday evening, the chances are you
will be so wan and hollow that all the prettiest
Spookesses will cut you in disgust.

Anybody who has read this far will notice
that The Bulletin doesn’t take much stock in
Theosophy. That’s so. Theosophy is one-half
assumption and t’other half moonshine. The
name has been tagged to all sorts of queer
beliefs since it was invented at Alexandria in
the age of Greek intellectual decadence, and
the latest variety of Theosophy is about the
crankiest of the lot. It is the child of a
marriage between Buddha and Blavatsky, to
which Buddha’s common sense has not de-
scended. Buddha was a frank Materialist. He
measured Man with the Universe, and couldn’t
see why the infinitesimal parasite of such an
infinitesimal orb should preserve an immortal
identity. Neither can anybody else who has
attained a conception of the masses and dis-
tances of astronomy. As a grain of salt is lost
in the ocean, taught Buddha, so the individual
man is lost in the cosmos. As when you
separate a chariot piece from piece, taking off
the wheels and the shafts and the body, there is
no chariot left, so when Death has disintegrated
the component parts of a man there is no man
left. As a flower, in some inexplicable way,
gives forth fragrance, so man flowers into
mind ; but the fragrance dies with the flower
and the mind with the man. This is a rational,
intelligible theory, anyway. But Theosophists,
and all other emotional religionists, find it
cheerless and barren. So they create geocen-
tric myths, in which the earth, in defiance of
all probability, becomes the kernel of the
universal nut—which is just as if they had a flea
900,000 million times smaller than any flea.ever
invented, and a dog 900,000 million times larger
than any dog ever discovered, and then fixed
the flea on the extreme end of the tail of the
dog, and remarked that it was perfectly obvious
that the flea wagged the dog. Then they find
a flea 100,000 million times smaller than the
first flea, and settle him carefully on the first
flea’s back. Then they say, “ Do you see that
little fellow—flea Number Two ? That’s Us.
We boss this circus: this unparalleled dog-show
is run for our exclusive benefit, just watch us
wag !” It isn’t logical ; but it’s mighty con-
soling.
• # #
Theosophy prides itself on being consoling.
It has invented an esoteric Buddhism, which
quite knocks out the old exoteric kind.
Buddha’s Nirvana was extinction, and when
the Ego got the best of Karma and entered
Nirvana it was wiped out finally. But
Theosophy says this is all wrong : you simply
lie low in Nirvana while they are airing the
sheets of a new world, and then you begin
existence again de novo, only higher, up the
tree. Intellectual men nowadays incline to
think that one existence is enough to get tired
in ; and, with Swinburne, thank “ whatever
gods there be ”
That no life lives for ever,
That dead men rise up never,
That even the weariest river
Winds somewhere safe to sea.
But Theosophy doesn’t pride itself on being
intellectual. Its method is entirely deductive
—it starts by taking everything for granted ;
and all human knowledge which is worth
having has been gained by the inductive
method, which takes nothing for granted, but
accumulates facts and observes the law which
unites them. Thus Theosophy is retrogression.
It would bury humanity once more in the age
of Faith, and turn its back on the age of
Reason, which, in the light of science, has


everywhere succeeded the ago of Faith. And
Faith, iu three words, is belief without
evidence. # # ,
Mrs. Besant knows all this perfectly well,
gut she deems her own faith justifies her in
patting the best Theosophio foot foremost, and
keeping its crippled fellow as far as possible in
the background. Thus she exalts Theosophy
ft s an ideal religion, and disappoints those who
o to hear on what facts it is founded. And
when, with due 11 mrish and mystery, the facts
a t last appear, they prove to be the merest
trumperies. Mrs. Beeant has been in the
astral body—that is, she has felt a sub-con-
sciousness apart from her physical body. And
w hat then? , She has observed clairvoyance
and clairaudience. And what then ? She has
known writing executed at a distance from the
controlling will. And what then ? Do these
tilings prove the existence of Karma, the dogma
0 f re incarnation, the difference of the seven
principles, the truth of the complicated
theosophio machinery ? They do, in the same
sense that the pons dsinorum proves the exist-
ence of a society of highly-evolved jackasses on
the other side of the mo >n. Doubtless there
are natural forces with which we are still im-
perfectly acquainted, but they have as much
connection with the “ secret doctrine ” of
Madame Blavatsky as kisses have with comet-
tads. #
So Mrs. B esa NT, a skilled advocate, glides
over the we tk places of her own case, and
vividly displays those of opposing Materialism.
Now, there are as many holes in Materialism as
there are holes in a ladder ; but, at all events,
Materialism can show the ladder, Theosophy
can only show the holes. Materialism cannot
account for the conversion of molecular move-
ment into thought; it cannot account for self-
consciousness ; and 'it does not hope to be ever
able to account for them. But as there is not an
iota of proof that thought or consciousness ever
existed without a material basis, Materialism
furnishes the best theory available to explain
the facts. Theosophy doesn’t profess to explain
them—that is, to justify them; it simply ignores
them and substitutes the imagination of Madame
Blavatsky, whose visions appear to have come
as often and as conveniently as Mormon revela-
tions. And, though science can’t understand
how matter produces thought or consciousness,
it believes they do with as much reason as the
average person, ignorant of the theory of sound,
believes that the organ ground under his window
produces a mockery of “ Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay.”
In spite of appearances, the tune map be play-
ing the organ, as Theosophists assert that mind
plays man. But it isn’t likely.
* * •
Theosophy is as wrong morally as mentally.
It preaches, like other Oriental creeds, the
crucifixion of the flesh, and inculcates renuncia-
tion in this life for the sake of profit in lives
to come. It has adopted the Buddhistic doc-
trine that the way to salvation is to crush out
every desire, every passion, everything natural
and human. As if you told a gardener that the
best way to grow a tree was by taking away its
soil, keeping off the sunshine, and clipping
every twig close to the root 1 As for immor-
tality, if the worst comes to the worst, there
is no need to da penance in this world to ensure
pleasure in the next. The man who is a good
husband, a good father, a good friend, and a
good citizen on this side of the grave isn’t going
to be far wrong on the other side. Whatever
power roosts at the root of things will see after
that. In the meantime, it’s poor philosophy,
as Ingersoll puts it, “to give up skim milk
here for the sake of butter beyond the clouds.”
Some for the Glories of this World ; and some
Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come ;
Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go.

Fair, but False.
The second hearing of the Speight v. Syme
libel-case came to a charming conclusion last
week. The eleven surviving jurymen were
unanimous in their verdict. They found that
Speight had been unjustly libelled by the Age,
although the Age’s comments upon Speight
were quite fair. In effect, the jury declared
that Speight was an honest manager of the
Victorian railways not incompetent, nor
wildly extravagant, nor the creature of corrupt
politicians, nor anything that the Age alleged
in its articles—and yet a man who had laid
himself open to unmerited abuse. In the law
of. “fair comment,” as expounded by Judge
W illiams, there was no hope for the jovial
plaintiff. It gave him no chance to recover
damages from the journal which wrought his
ruin. Had the jury followed the Judge’s direc-
tion they would have found the Age charges
of reckless extravagance to be “ substantially
true.” The verdict was a flat contradiction of
Ms Honor’s very evident opinion. The jury
disagreed en masse with their oracle’s estimate
of the evidence, whilst agreeing that his
definition of fair comment, which exonerated
defendant from all legal responsibility as
regards nine out of ten libels, must con-
trol their verdict. On the tenth count, the
same that Speight had already scored a .£lOO
win with, they awarded plaintiff one farthing
damages. Judge Williams advised them not
to allow much further reparation for the one
statement which was inexcusably false, and
they fixed upon the old traditional minimum
amount. This is presumably the finish of the
great Vic. Railway Libel Case. Two juries
have dealt with it. The first dozen men were
so fogged by the involved impartiality of the
Judge’s charge that they came to no sort of
agreement, save on the single point aforesaid.
Uie second trial was presided over by a
Judge who prides himself upon never being
vague. His hostility to Speight’s side of the
case was quite clear. The public saw it stick-
ing out from the newspaper reports. Yet on
Hus occasion the eleven surviving jurymen were
unanimously favorable to Speight’s personal
and professional reputation. Sympathisers
with Speight will naturally find fault with
Judge Williams, in that he gave the Age all
credit for having said no more than it might
reasonably suppose to be true at the time
whereas he did not dwell upon the fact that the
libel time was quite different to the era of
Speight’s expensive station-building and other
acts of alleged shocking extravagance. Speight
came to Victoria in the bright dawn of the boom.
The Government during the next two years bor-
rowed 20 millions of money and gave most of it to
Speight with instructions to spend it at once.
Any number of Melbourne banks, the while, were
busily collecting British deposits, and giving it
—lending isn’t the word—to their directors and
directors’ friends. The population of the
country, according to every person who came
into close contact with the new-chum railway
ruler, was bound to double and treble itself at
a furious rate. On every hand he was told to
look forward to a glorious future, and lay his
plans accordingly. He did. He was wrong.
Would another new-chum in Speight’s place have
been less wrong, and were his boom-time mis-
calculations deserving of the punishment in-
flicted upon him —by the Age? Judge Williams
seemed to look at nothing from the Speight
point of view. Here was a circumstance that
he passed over altogether, because it wasn’t in
the evidence. Was Speight’s peremptory dis-
missal from his billet a “ fair comment ” upon
his integrity and administrative ability ? The
jury have in effect said “No” to that, and
very distinctly. But it was fair to bring a
mass of substantially untrue charges against
Speight, and achieve his overthrow by means
of those misstatements. Speight has suffered.
David Syme has suffered. We have all suffered,
and now, let us conclude with a loud “Amen.”
The absurdly melodramatic arrest of Mrs. Ven-
nell, for the alleged murder of her child at
Maryborough (Vic.), recalls to mind the Beach
(Geelong) tragedy, which remains a mystery to
this day. Some years ago farmer Beach was
found dead from a gunshot wound, his wife and
a man-servant being in the house at the time.
These more or less suspected parties showed no
disposition to leave the neighbourhood after the
coroner’s jury had returned an open verdict.
Mrs. Beach lived on in the old house, the man-
servant got married and removed to a cottage
hard by. After a while a theatrical policeman
worked up a ghost of a case and obtained a
warrant for their arrest. Both widow and ex-
servant were always available and would have
walked straight to the police-station upon
receipt of a post-card requesting them to come
along and be arrested. The pompous inspector
preferred to regard them as desperate criminals
in hiding. Late at night he went to their
respective abodes with his warrants in one hand
and a bull’s-eye lantern in the other, ordered
them to get out of their beds, and led them hand-
cuffed away to durance vile. The same course
was adopted in Mrs. Vennell’s case. She was
still occupying her cottage home, nursing the
two children who escaped death, quite ready to
give herself up to “ the authorities ” if called
for. A detective, after looking for evi-
dence at Maryborough, comes back to Mel-
bourne in a violent hurry, obtains a warrant,
returns to Maryborough by the evening train,
and takes his Guy Fawkes lantern and warrant
round to the Vennell domicile just as the
woman is getting ready for bed. The police
found her “ dressed in a loose wrapper with her
hair hanging down,” and they hurried her off
to gaol forthwith. An inspector, or sergeant,
armed with a murder-warrant against a deaf
mute who had lost both his legs, would make a
point of effecting a “ clever capture ” in the
silence of the night. The great ambition of
such people is to introduce appalling stage
effect into the simplest and most commonplace
of jobs, and a lickspittling daily press encour-
ages their nonsensical displays.
When J. B. Patterson returned thanks to
the electors of Castlemaine, after his return by
a scraggy majority, he made some pathetic
allusions to his fallen state, and remarked that
his Government had only “paid the penalty of
the odium attaching to retrenchment.” In
other words, Patterson claims that it was
because of his vigorous retrenchment policy
that he was ejected. Yet, so long as James
Brown P. retrenched and proposed new taxa-
tion to make ends meet, Victoria supported
him loyally, and gave him a steadily increasing
majority. It was only when his budget came
along, and the country realised, by reason of
the deficiency, that he wasn’t retrenching
nearly enough, and hadn’t the courage to
impose new taxation where it was wanted, that
it rose up and threw him out. And in place of
him it has sent in Turner, who is pledged to
make more retrenchments than Patterson
ever dreamt of, and to levy additional taxation
as well. Patterson’s attempt to represent
himself as a martyr in the cause of economy—
as a person who is thrown out because he
did a disagreeable duty manfully—is the
meanest thing in a very mean career. It
was his moral cowardice not the moral
cowardice of the community—which broke him
up. As a rule, in times of stress, the com-
munity, which has to pay the bill, faces the
trouble much more bravely than the Govern-
ment which has only to collect it, and if the
Government ceased trembling in abject fear of
losing its billet, and went straight ahead with
its work, it would come out much better in the
end. It is rarely that a Ministry has done so,
but when such a thing has happened the
country has generally given it an enthusiastic
support. The mistake which the Patterson
variety of politician makes is in imagining that
the community at large is as mean and timorous
and time-serving as he is himself, and shaping
his feeble and crooked course accordingly.
B. D. Morehead’s statement in Queensland
Parliament the other night, to the effect that
the Labor-party, as a body, were imported into
that country at the taxpayers’ expense, is a new
political taunt which, whether made up of truth
or the reverse, will do as much harm when
hurled backwards as when fired forwards.
When Queensland employers ruled the roost
they imported free immigrants, despite the
warnings of the politically-wise, and the hostile
attitude of the only half-employed workers, and
if what Morehead now says be true, that the old
rulers are being pushed off their perch by these
immigrants, the natural remark is— Nemesis !
Again, if it be true, then these immigrants were
imported not for love but for their labor, and
so are in the same position, as Glasses’ ob-
served, as are railway commissioners and
others. But again, the statement is not true.
Of the members who represent the Labor-party
in Parliament the history of four-fifths is
public, and to that extent rebuts the allega-
tion. Of the population of Queensland, not
more than 50,000 are free immigrants ; and of
these many have risen to commercial positions
which make them sympathisers with the More-
iiead party. It is no more true, on the basis of
natural inference, that the Labor-party out of
Parliament is constituted of free immigrants
than it is that the Labor-party in Parliament is
so constituted.
Dibbs and Copeland both denounce the home-
stead provisions in Carruthbrs’ new N.S. W.
Land Bill—which provisions are merely the
Maoriland perpetual lease idea under another
name and with slight alterations —on the
ground that they will cause a serious loss of
“revenue.” In other words, the State will
only get the rent of the land—which is really
revenue ; instead of getting the price of it in
one act, and calling it revenue when it is
nothing of the kind. Hitherto the policy of
N.S. Wales has been to sell off its assets as
fast as it could, and call the money
thus obtained “ income,” which is just
the same system as that of the spendthrift
who lives on his capital until it is all gone,
barring the fact that the average Treasurer lies
about it by implication, and says it isn’t the
capital but the interest that he is living on. If
the homestead provisions in the new law are
largely availed of, there certainly will be a
falling off in what is commonly called land
“ revenue,” and so there ought to be; if the
“ revenue ” doesn’t fall off it will only be
because the measure is a failure. All genuine
democrats are waiting anxiously for that
falling-off. The only pity is that it didn’t
come some 25 years ago or more.
The ruthless determination of organised New
South Wales squatters to “down” the unions
which form the sole link between the bush
labourers and independence, the single means
on which they can rely if they would call their
souls their own, receives every day fresh illus-
tration. With the banks behind them, the
pastoralists disdain compromise and damn
public opinion. By their deliberate breach of
the 1891 agreement without reference to the
men who joined with them to make it, by their
refusal of George Dibbs’ offers of mediation,
and again by their rejection of the similar offer
made by the Conciliation department, they have
shown that they care not what loss comes to
the country provided they attain their ends.
They insist upon ramming their own conditions,
the whole of their own conditions, and nothing
but their own conditions, down the throats of
their employes, with the result that, as
worms will persist in turning, the province
is put to great expense to preserve order.
The chief objection which the men make,
and make reasonably, is to the eighth
clause, which provides that the employer’s
representative shall be sole judge of matters in
dispute. Now, shearers are not lawyers, and
do not generally know that this condition is
powerless to deprive them of their right of
redress at law in cases of which the law takes
cognisance. By the simple’expedient of point-
ing this out in a footnote to the clause some
squatters have had their shearing amicably
carried through. But the united pastoralists
as a body apparently scorn to make even such
a slender concession. They do not wish to
treat with their workers as men to men ; they
wish to rule serfs or slaves, with heads kept
firmly under the capitalist heel. And, at the
same time, they demand protection for their
property from a Government professedly demo-
cratic. The safety of property is essential to
the stability of the State—true. But flesh and
blood, after all, have higher claims than pro-
perty. The squatters had better not go too
far.
Martha Needle, the wild, wayward Melb.
woman, who suffered from fits and glassy eyes,
and abnormal hankering after the children she
is supposed to have slain by inches, was last
week convicted of poisoning her lover’s brother.
She had threatened to kill her lover’s mother ;
apparently tried to poison another of the
J uncker family, and it is now fair to assume that
she disposed of her late husband as well as the
offspring of their union. Hence Mrs. Needle
is exceedingly likely to hang. The Law declares
her a sane murderess, inasmuch as she bought
Rough-on-rats and knew that she was adminis-
tering it for a deadly purpose. The world
knows comely Martha to be a homicidal
maniac, with selfish method in her madness,
but society votes for her execution all the same.
It were less trouble to despatch Martha than
to keep her under lock and key. She must
never again be allowed a chance to arsenicise a
fellow creature, so why not put her neck
through a hole in a noose and drop her through
a hole in one of the prison galleries ? There
are several objections to this proceeding. In
the first place, the Law, if it kills Martha
Needle, will kill her under the false pretence
that she is sane. It will make a debasing spec-
tacle of her death, in accordance with custom.
Furthermore, the Law will allow a clergyman
to turn her poor diseased thoughts “ to Jesus,”
and religion will associate a horrible tragedy
with a hideous farce. If the hanging of one
Needle had a deterrent effect upon other
Needles there would be reason in the sentence
passed upon Martha ; but, as it tends to an
opposite result, why destroy one epileptic to
encourage the rest ?
The unintentionally funny-man of the Melb.
elections was Foster Rogers, who astonished
the touts by getting in for South Yarra.
Rogers travelled solely upon his invention of a
new patent surplus-tax, which he explained at
made length to great numbers of little meetings.
The object of this amusing article is to raise
two millions sterling without the expense of
collection. On a given day—if Foster Rogers
can get his tax put into practice —every adult
male inhabitant of Victoria will receive a blue
paper, similar to a census paper, requesting him
to fill in the values of all his worldly posses-
sions, also particulars of his liabilities. After
deducting liabilities from assets, he must strike
a balance and return \ per cent, tax (in postage
stamps) to the Treasurer, and next morning
the accrued deficit will disappear like an evil
dream. Also, the wheels of commerce will
revolve one more, and the nation will feel like
a giant who has got a hard-boiled dumpling ofl
his chest. Rogers has foreseen occasional
difficulties, and provided for them. Sup-
posing that an inhabitant’s sole assets con*
sist of kitchen utensils and bedroom furniture,
to the amount of £4 195., and three fourpenny
bottles of beer —making £5 in all. Not pos*
sessing the necessary sixpence for surplus-tax
he will give the Government an 1.0. U. for that
amount, the Treasurer charging him 8 per
cent. If the “tanner” and interest be not
forthcoming before the end of the financial year
the State will, we suppose, levy upon the
defaulter’s frying-pan or water-jug, and take
out the surplus-tax in that simple way. The
large majority of the 700-odd voters who polled
for Rogers could see the absurdities of his
scheme, probably, but they made him their
member because he was earnest and well-
meaning, and told them tales of old times when
other men, in other countries, recognised their
duty to the commonw T ealth and did it cheer-
fully. The enthusiast wasn’t bidding for the
“ popular ” vote with his all-round surplus-tax,
yet he got the votes of those who could least
afford to pay any tax at all, and Harris, the
old member for Capital, was beaten on the post
by Foster Rogers. There’s a satisfactory
moral hanging to the incident.
“The Sydney College of Music, 1894.”
Among other noble attributes inherited by us
from our progenitors, the everlasting British race,
is an absorbing passion for attaching portions of
the alphabet to our names. So strong has this
passion become, that even our brightest intellects
fall into imbecility over the prospect of a C.M.G.
or a K.C.M.G. The Australian Universities
turns out B.A.’s by the dray-load. There are
among us legions of M.D.’s, M.R.C.S.’s,

all sense of shame as to publicly affix the letters
R. to an otherwise unobjectionable name.

Next the reader is invited to read the names of
the Foundation Members of the Sydney College
of Music. They are as follows
Neville Barnett, F.R.C.0.; John A. Delaney, Albert
Fisher, Charles Huenerbein, Guglielmo Lardelli, F.R.C.0.;
S. Gordon L. Lavers, H. R. Maclean, A.Mus., T.G.L.;

Oairos Rego, J. Edward Sykes, Ernest E. P. Truman,
A.R.C.0.; J. Bede White, A.Mus., T.C.L.; Montague
Younger.
The foundation members had evidently met and
elected a Council, for we find further back the
Council, consisting of fifteen gentlemen whose
names as printed are identical with the fifteen
foundation members, given above. So that the
fifteen foundation members have evidently elected
each other councillors unanimously. Then they
proceed to elect each other to offices bearing.mys-
terious names :
Warden, Hector R. Maclean, A.Mus., T.C.L.; Vice-
Warden, Montague Younger; Registrar, Joseph Bede
White, A.Mus., T.C.L.; Bursar, Charles Huenerbein;
Director of Examinations, Neville Q. Barnett, F.R.C.0.;
Chairman of the Board of Examiners, John A. Delaney.
So much for the construction of this highly-
patronised institution, which has created itself the
supreme musical tribunal in N.S. Wales, and
which takes upon itself (with no initiative from
the Education Department, the University, or
any other responsible body) to lay on hands, and
to pass on the musical apostolic succession.
In order to judge the value of this College, it is
necessary, now that we know who are in it, to find
who are left out. Looking round the Sydney
musical world, and taking conductors first, one
asks : Where is Maestro Hazon ? In pianists,
where are the brilliant Henri Kowalski and Alice
Charbonnet-Kellermann ? Where is that refined
musician Mr. Sydney Moss? Where is Mr.
Harry Hyndes ? In organists, where are Wiegand
and Augustus Gehde? In violinists, where are
Rivers Allpress, Horace Poussard and Henri
Stael? Those names are absent. So we have
in the College an ensemble with all the lead-
ing instruments left out, with no conductor, and
with the sounding brass, the tinkling cymbals
and the kettledrums trying to play lead. To
get an analogous case, it is almost necessary
to suppose that the Sydney Brush Club,
a deserving institution composed of rising
minor artists—some of them chiefly engaged in
the useful and artistic label-drawing industry-
had suddenly called itself “The Sydney College
of Art, 1894,” got together a heavy list of patrons,
and forthwith proceeded to examine candidates
and confer distinctions, titles, and diplomas, and
to re-distribute the alphabet, and meanwhile had
left outside of its ranks, and utterly ignored, such
men as Streeton, Lister, Mahouy, Ashton, Roberts,
Minns, Spence and Gollingridge. This would
have been as gross a piece of impertinence on the

Art Society of N.S.W.
With a wealth of newly-acquired wall-space,
N.S. W. Art Society makes its 15th exhibition the
best yet held, for not more than a score of the
works exhibited are unworthy of the space
occupied. It is, however, noticeable that through-
out the whole collection, with one exception,
there is not a single picture that attempts to
typify Australian life. That this exception is, in
certain important respects, the finest thing in the
gallery should be sufficient to show our artists the
field open to them. Mr. Tom Roberts—who a
year or two ago scored heavily in Melbourne with
a similar subject, for which he was paid some-
thing like 300 guineas—has undoubtedly sent the
picture of the year in his “Shearing at New-
stead ” (300), a work bearing evidence throughout
of most careful and conscientious study. This is
emphatically a picture typifying a phase of Aus-
tralian life that is rapidly passing away, and the
trustees have done wisely in securing it for the
National Gallery. Mr. Roberts’ other pictures
consist of portraits, which tend to confirm the
impression that he succeeds better when making
the best of the face of a pretty woman than when
attempting to dignify that of a prosaic man.
• • «
Mr. Lister has sent a dozen contributions,
several of them of exceptional proportions.
“ Where the Sea Tide Ebbs and Flows ” (284) is a
large picture, and in many respects the finest work
he has yet turned out. The fleecy grey clouds in
the sky and the reflections in the shallows in the
foreground are admirably treated ; but a big pic-
ture has been made out of small material. Mr.
Lister might have made an even greater success
had he painted this view on a smaller scale. The
same fault is to be found in that artist’s “ East-
ward Ho ” (240), although it is impossible not to
admire his treatment of the stately ocean swell.
“Peaceful Morn” (210), showing an expanse of
sand with a grey sky through which the sun is
struggling to force itself, is a far more successful,
though less ambitious, example of Mr. Lister’s
skill; but, taken all in all, his woodland scene,
“Nature’s Solitude” (325), with its delicate
Corot-like treatment of the foliage and the bracken
undergrowth, is the best of his contributions this
year, and is especially interesting as showing a
phase of his talent hitherto unknown.
• # #
The “Portrait ol a Lady” (239), by Mr.
Gordon Coutts, which worthily occupies a place
of honor at the end of the room, is an extremely
fine piece of solid and honest work; the features
are excellently modelled, and the treatment of the
black cloak, which really looks as if a human body
were inside it, is a masterpiece of technical skill.
Mr. A. H. Fullwood sends 12 pictures of varying
merit, but his large canvas, “Sunrisefrom Mount
Wellington, Tasmania ” (233), is the most daring
and most successful work he has ever produced,
though in places the color is overloaded. The
most successful portion of the picture is the paint-
ing of the faint purple mist in the middle distance,
and of the boulders and undergrowth in the fore-
ground. Of the artist’s other works we prefer
“A Rngoon Camp ” (209), a mob of cattle in the
water, although the drawing of the animals is
very wooden indeed. This latter fault is also to
be found with his “Newbold Ford, Clarence
River ” (333) —a subject so excellent as to be
worthy of treatment on a larger scale. Mr. Full-
wood’s figure picture, “ Bad News from Town ”
(283), cannot be regarded as a success, the man
standing over the fire being too small for his sur-
roundings, while the story the canvas is intended
to convev is not very obvious.
• * •
The exhibition shows that the “impressionist”
craze is still rampant among the younger men,
but it is pleasant to find that Mr. Arthur Streeton
(the Australian high priest of the school) has for-
saken the eccentricities of his artistic youth. He
has certainly never produced a finer work than his
“ Gloucester Buckets ” (293), with the grey trunks
of the. barkless trees standing out against the
distant purple hills and dull, leaden sky. The
tone of the picture is pitched in a low key; and
this has necessitated a restraint in the use of
which the artist has shown a new and powerful
phase of his talent as a painter. His other con-
tributions are on a smaller scale, but show the
same fine treatment of the subjects chosen, the
“Purple, Green and Gold,” a sunlight effect
(snapped up by a lady-buyer for ten guineas)
being especially successful. Mr. J. R. Ashton,
who has not exhibited for several years past, has
sent in a number of oil-paintings, also water-
colors and pastels. Of the former, “La
Malade Imaginaire” (274), a cleverly-painted
study of a child in bed, is perhaps the most inter-
esting, but it is to be regretted that the artist
did not use his great and varied abilities on more
promising subjects. His water-colors consist, for
the most part, of studies of models in different
stages of undress, to one of which the singularly
unapt title of “ 11 Penseroso ” is attached.
* * *
Mr. Piguenit contributes half-a-dozen oil-paint-
ings, all on a small scale, the largest being “ Over
the Hills and Far Away.” Conventional though
this sterling artist may be in following traditional
methods of treatment, there can be no question
that he gains the effect he aims at.
• • •
Mr. Percy Spence’s chief picture this year is
“The Long Day Closes”—two horses returning
from work in the evening, which would hare
achieved a great success were people not so
familiar with the same artist’s charming work,
“The Ploughman Homeward Plods," in N.S.W.
National Gallery.
• * •
Last year Mr. F. P. Mahony, in his “The Days
of Old,’’ made something more than a demand on
the public admiration of his technical ability, and
it is to be regretted that he has not followed the
same course on this occasion. His “Sunday” is
a study of two tired horses, resting from their
week-day labors. The picture tells no story, but
it would be hard to overpraise the drawing and
painting. The same good qualities are to be
found in his portrait of the racehorse Abercorn
(321) and “ A Veteran ’’ (250), while his portrait
of Mr. D. H. Batohen is excellent in a different
field of art. Mr. Mahony has also here a very
powerful study on a pastel of a tiger’s head,
evidently carefully sketched from life.
* * •
Mr. Sid. Long has apparently laid himself out
to startle the public, and has done so to some
extent, as the Gallery trustees have, for some
inscrutable reason, bought his “By Tranquil
Waters ” (275). Not that ample signs of talent are
lacking, but it is emphatically the talent of pro-
mise and not of performance. Here and there, as,
for example, in the limpid water of the distance
and the heavy shadows cast in the stream to the
left of the picture, some admirable work is shown,
but the effect of the whole is crude and garish.
If Mr, Long fulfills his undoubted promise, no one
will more regret than he that his early picture
should have been accorded a place in the National
collection.
# # «
There is little to note among the contributions
of the lady artists this year, save the fact that
some of the younger generation show a commend-
able inclination to break away from the trammels
of conventionality. As an instance, Miss Muskett’s
“In the Happy Morning ” (266), a girl in pink,
lying on the grass in the full sunlight. The effect
is original, and the treatment broad and forcible,
although the somewhat dingy background seems
to be out of harmony with the bright light of the
rest of the picture. Another notable contribution
to this section is “Country Visitors ” (317), in
which the key-note is cleverly given in the red
shawl of the old woman ; and praise is also due to
Miss M. Fleming for her still-life studies, which
show a strength sadly lacking in the niggling
method of most of her sister-artists.

The water colors, as a whole, do not exhibit any
special features, but if anything could redeem
them from a charge of mediocrity, it would be the
presence of Mr. B. E. Minns’studies of aborigines,
which the trustees have very properly bought for
the Gallery. Apart from the admirable technique,
the characterisation of the different types of black-
fellow is worthy of unstinted praise. The same
artist has managed to throw a fine sense of breezi-
ness into his water-color drawing “The Cows are
in the Corn ” (84), in which the figures and land-
scape are equally good. Mr. A. J. Hanson has
sent several charmingly idyllic drawings of
country-villages, and Mr. W. B. Spong has con-
tributed some Maoriland scenes and a representa-
tion of a street in Brittany; but on the whole
there is a monotony of subject which makes this
part of the exhibition uninteresting. Of the
sculpture it need only be said that, with the excep-
tion of Mr. D. H. Batchen’s “Sprinter,” there is
nothing above mediocrity, and a good deal that is
below it.
The Wild-Cat Column.
Ever since the B.N.Z. became a State-guar-
anteed institution suggestions have cropped up at in-
tervals to the effect that the Australian Governments
should guarantee, in a somewhat similar fashion, the
reconstructed banks of Australia. Such a proceeding, if
the guarantee was unconditional, would naturally com-
mend itself to many badly-scared creditors and share-
holders. It would at once raise the reconstructed
deposits to par, and the depositor, who was promised 4J
per cent, mainly because the security was rather uncer-
tain—the English creditor, as a rule, would gladly take
3i per cent, these times if he could get absolute safety
along with it—would then get his 4J per cent, and reason-
ably good security as well. Also, the State-guaranteed
banks would be able to get a lot more British deposits at a
low rate, and go in for another boom straightway. Such
an arrangement is altogether too one-sided' to commend
itself to any moderately sane Government. Still it is
possible to construct a State guarantee which would do a
lot of good to the various reconswindled institutions, and
do a good deal to restore “ confidence,’' while at the
same time it would prevent more disastrous banking
booms, and save a considerable amount of money to this
country.
The terms of such a guarantee might be some-
thing like this: First, all banks doing business in Aus-
tralia to be absolutely prohibited from taking any more
British deposits under any circumstances whatever.
Second, in the case of any reconstructed institution,
which proved, after a proper State audit, even sufficiently
solvent to pay interest on its deposits and leave a small
annual surplus, the province to which it specially belongs
to offer its creditors 3J per cent, debentures in exchange
for their present 4J per cent, deposit receipts. As Aus-
tralian 3J per cent, debentures are mostly worth within a
fraction of par, the offer would be a distinct gain to the
depositors, and ought to be readily accepted. By this
process the State would become the principal creditor of
the reconstructed institutions, and could reasonably
demand to nominate at least one-half the directorate,
and to institute a rigid system of State inspection.
Then the interest payable by the banks on their
guaranteed deposits might be reduced to 4 per
cent., instead of the present 4J. The advantages to be
gained are as follows;—(1) The interest payable to the
reconstructed British depositors would be reduced by
£200,000 per annum, which makes a serious difference in
the drain upon a country which has already to send alto-
gether too much money to England. (2) The banks would
save all round about $ per cent, annually in interest,
which, on the Immense sums involved, makes a large
saving, and in the case of some tottering institutions may
mean all the difference between solvency and bankruptcy.
(3) The State would make J per cent, per annum on the
transaction, which should build up & sinking fund suffi-
cient to cover all ultimate losses. (4) The very worst
banka would then pull through almost to a certainty,
whereas under present conditions some of them probably
will not. Even a badly-decomposed institution could get
through with a State guarantee, with a State auditor and
an independent directorate which can afford to insist
on cutting down or stopping dividends if neces-
sary, and carrying half the profits to reserve, ano
with unlimited time to realise and nurse its shaky
securities. The safety thus afforded would naturally
involve an improvement in share values. _ (5) As the State
could afford to give time so long as its interest was paid
regularly, the necessity of “putting the screw” on the
bank’s solvent debtors for realisation purposes would be
much lessened. Also, with a State guarantee and State
audit as a security against panic and fraud, the necessity
for keeping the present stupendous cash reserves lying
idle and profitless would be vastly diminished. (6) The
new departure would stop one of the many openings
through which British capital finds its way into Australia
to eat up the land with the locust-plague of interest.
Two conspicuous difficulties stand in the way.
When any portion of the money was repaid to the
depositor— i.e., the State—every precaution would have
to be taken that it was not employed for any purpose save
to pay off the public creditor. The only way to effect this
would be by special Act of Parliament, and by trusting to
the common-sense of the community not to repeal the Act.
The other difficulty is that when the main body of any
bank's creditors agreed to accept State bonds at 3J per
cent, in exchange for their deposits, a few malcontents
would probably hold out with the hope that they would
get the benefit of the State security and retain their 4&
Ser cent, as well. But these stragglers would probably
e few, and it should be quite po»sible to pay them off in
cash if they could not otherwise be disposed of.

Says Sydney Sunday Times : “ The shares of
the Bank of New South Wales have fallen, because it is
expected that with four millions of gold locked up in its
vaults the bank cannot pay such good dividends in the
future as in the.past. Its very strength is its weakness,
so far as earning money is concerned.” As it happens,
the actual amount of gold is only about £3,000,000, but
even then, what an argument in favour of establishing a
regular local market for State securities 1 If theN.S.W.
Government would issue its 3J per cent, loans locally,
and thereby create a safe and always available liquid
security, such a bank as the N.S.W. could easily keep
£1,500,000, at least, of its present cash reserve in N.S.W.
consols. And that would mean an additional income of
£52,500 a year, and an additional dividend of about 3 per
cent, per annum. Some more loans for conversion pur-
poses will shortly be wanted in N.S.W. Any Treasurer
with a vestige of enterprise would try, when the occasion
arrives, if the local market, which rushed See’s 4 per
cent, loan when money was much dearer than it is now,
won’t respond at Si.

short of dwellings just now 7, and the co. proposes to build
a'great number of cheap corrugated-iron cottages—which,
in such a climate, will be another name for corrugated-
iron hells ; and reckons, apparently with some show of
reason, on letting them at 30s. a week. Even at 20s. the
co., so far as can be estimated, will realise about 22 per
cent, profit, so it can be recommended as a good, reliable,
blood-sucking investment which can hardly go wrong
unless the bottom falls out of Coolgardie.

town for three months, studying up the accounts so that
he would not need to ask for information. Great was the

Dear Bulletin, — No doubt it is hard that the
relatives of the school-teacher killed at Newcastle should
get nothing from the N.S.W. Superannuation Fund to
which she contributed. But relatives have no claim, and
this is where the fund has already been abused. For
instance, some contributors have none dependent on
them, others have several. Should benefits be unequal
when contributions do not differ? In England the civil-
servant has superannuation for himself (there is no fund
or contributions, for the State long ago took over the
matter on an actuarial basis), and to meet the cases of
those dependent on him there is also compulsory
insurance.—Yours, V.

The returns of Victorian gold for ’94 are the
most satisfactory of any for the group. The first nine
months of ’94 show that 543,5760 z. have been produced
for coinage. If we add to this the reasonable expectation
for the three remaining months, we have a total of
723,0000 z.— an enormous increase on the 693,0000 z. minted
for Vic. miners in '93. In fact, the increased Vic. produc-
tion is almost as important as the whole present produc-
tion of Westralia I If we take the ’9l yield (576,3990 z.)
as the standard, and reckon up the increases of ’92, ’93
and ’94 over this amount, we get a gross result of 319,030
oz. Westralia’s gross yield for the same three years is
866,4380 z. That is to say, the figures representing the
increased activity in Vic. mining are almost ns consider-
able as the figures representing the gross yield for Wes-
tralia. This, of course, eliminates Westralia’s mortgage
on the future. But Dav lesford, Steigliiz, and Tarnagulla

because the business is forced upon it by the constantly

After 24 years’ cessation the old Windmill Hill
mine, Bendigo, has paid 6d. div. It is now on a big body

The Old Bushman’s mine (Parkes), in the hands
of the tributors, has given a second satisfactory yield of
2£oz. to the ton. Baxter and Saddler have struck gold in
an adjoining shaft, and arrangements are to be made with
the Bushman's co. to take over the property after the
tributors’ time expires and work both mines together.
This will mean employment for 160 men.

The Melbourne mining show, to be held shortly
under the auspices of the Vic. Mines Department, is not
likely to be a great success, as machinery manufacturers
naturally disincline to exhibiting in a yard attached to an
opposition foundry. The Sydney show, on the contrary,
is likely to be well supported by Melb. firms. One of
the largest of them has decided to spend no less than
£5OO in sending and erecting a display of mining
machinery.

Lord Sudeley admits he is an amateur at gold-

up at Coolgardie many duffers, but if ?00 are placed in
this category, there remain 700 mines which the owner!
are satisfied will pay well when crushing and water are
available. He himself saw stone in many mines which
would not godwts., but many ozs. The Bulletin believes
there are about 10 Coolgardie mines which, up to date,
have proved, or almost proved, that they are certain div.-
payers.

BETTER TIMES AHEAD.
Some people say that life is too short, but this
opinion stands rather solitary, and most men wish
it were shorter. A certain popular Governor
wishes that his seven years engagement were at
an end next week. The lover wishes the same
regarding his engagement to Mary, whom he
would rather marry to-morrow than next year.
The clerk wishes that pay-day came round twice
a week at least. We are all looking forward to
some expected pleasure, and then live in
the hope of the next one. People are made
wretched by the lack of proper enjoyments to
divert their mind. The best is undoubtedly read-
ing, if you are alone, conversation if you choose
friends, and to crown both indulge in a Frossard’s
Cavour, a mild and aromatic smoke sold in packets
of eight for one shilling.*

Again we are told that “The Wealth of Nations

never been told how rioh it ever was. The fact of striking
it "as rioh as ever ” at 40ft. is said to be “all the more
gratifying to Mr. Alex. Forrest because of the attempts
made to decry the mine by his political opponents.”
Sheer nonsense. Rich mines cannot be made poor by talk,
nor can they be made rich by newspaper correspondents.
That is a matter for crushing, and if the Wealth of
Nations is “as rich as ever” it is only reasonable to ex-
pect 5000 or fiOOOozs. of gold from it almost immediately.

down to die. Meanwhile, the speculator, he of the cool
head and the stony heart, he of the glossy coat and the
artificial smile, thrives and dies an honored citizen. His

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

Rose ”
Lyceum “Ma Mie Rosette.”
Theatre Royal “The Octoroon.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “ Morocco Bound.”
Theatre Royal “ The Irishman.”
Alexandra Inigo Tyrrell’s Co
“ Ma Mie Rosette,” which began well at
Sydney Lyceum on Saturday last, and promises
to go on still better, is remarkable, among other
things, as a sinful libel on the character of the
white-plumed King of Navarre. History has
hitherto regarded this monarch as a hero with a
habit of rushing to battle wherever he could find
a battle within rushing distance, and with only
one visible defect, namely his craving after
Flossies in time of peace. In “Ma Mie Rosette,”
however, he is depicted as a sovereign who incited
other men to rush to battle, that he might
lead their best girls astray in their absence.
Nellie Stewart, in a very brief red frock, is the
girl whom he wants to lead astray in this particular
instance, and the guileless Rosette is so willing to
be led, and her bucolic lover, Tapley, is so ready
to go away and batter the Spanish foe and leave
the coast clear, that it seems almost a pity the
event doesn’t come off. Bub Rosette has such
a horrid dream in Act 11. that she abjures the
King, and Tapley stays at home after all. There-
fore the lovers are married, and probably in after
years, when the wind whistles through their cot-
tage, and the glamor has worn off their love, and
Tapley is an elderly plain agriculturist dozing by
the chimney-corner and uttering loud snorts in his
sleep, she feels very, very sorry that she ever had
that dream, and wishes she had gone off with the
joyous King of Navarre, and been a sinful
Duchess.
# # #
Rosette, as already mentioned, is played
by Miss Nellie Stewart in a very brief skirt and
an air of rustic simplicity. The general verdict
of the crowd which went out to have a drink
between the acts was that she is the best thing
Our Nellie has yet accomplished, and The Bulle-
tin will let it stand at that. Brownlow started
his part as the King with ten separate colds
which brought his lower notes into great
tribulation, especially when he warbled the
touching appeal beginning “ Ma Mie Rosette,”
and seemed to be weeping in his long
brown boots. Bub for all that he looks a stately
and beautiful king, and why any girl should
refuse to go away with him at once is a
mystery. Lauri plays his comic part with tremen-
dous vigor, being assisted in his fell purpose by
the bright and capable Miss Marietta Nash, and
the dancing of this pair is a marvel to witness.
The other notable characters are a battered and
war-worn colonel, by Howard Vernon; Tapley as
a melodious lover with a comparatively small part;
and Miss Flor ice Young, who is supposed to
have fallen before the tale commenced, and who
leads a gorgeous but wicked existence in the
chateau. Miss Young seems to have good times
in the chateau, and if she is inserted as a proof of
the advantages of virtue she is an utter failure.

“ The Shamrock and the Rose,” re which
this paper made some kind observations in the
past, is again doing well at Her Majesty’s. As a
moral lesson it is. unexceptionable, for the wicked
man hardly gets a show all through, and he never
starts a scheme which doesn’t instantly fall in
pieces on his head. Everybody who thinks of
being a villain ought to have a look at this drama,
and when he sees how the bad character is insulted
and dragged around by the hair through four acts,
he will reform right there. If he doesn’t, his case
is incurable.

The Thorn ton-Arnold season at Sydney
Criterion closed with two nights of “Captain
Fritz,” and Mr. Arnold has now moved on to trill
his plaintive German melodies to other ears. A
number of enraged bookmakers would gladly go
after him_ and end his melody with a saw if the
opportunity only offered. Mr. Arnold is the most
consistently lucky backer of horses in the pro-
fession, and while Thornton occupied the stage he
had nothing to do save go out with his heavenly
smile to various racecourses and back winners.

“ The Octoroon,” by Miss Maggie Moore
and co,, was announced for last Wednesday, at
Sydney Royal, when Salem Scudder, presumably,
took the opportunity to once more advance his
theory that the camera can’t lie. Which theory
is only half true, for if the camera doesn’t lie the
photo, tells the truth with extreme difficulty.
Some further remarks on this subject are post-
poned until next week.
** * *
Mrs. Besant’s lecture on “ Mahatmas ”
was wisely reserved till about the close of her
Sydney season. The matter which the community
most wanted to hear about was the mystic
Mahatma, and if it had known earlier what a
hopeless disappointment he really is it would have
been bad for business. The artful Smythe pro-
bably realised this fact and acted accordingly. To
become a Mahatma, it seems, one must first study
for 12, 24, or 36 years. The nature of the studies
isn’t explained, but apparently they consist
mostly of vague, unspecified meditation after the
fashion of those philosophers who became wise by
fixedly contemplating their own stomachs. Then
the student must marry and rear children, and
when they are old enough to shift for themselves
he goes out into a forest and studies for the rest
of his life. After that he dies, and is reincar-
nated, and studies some more, and keeps
on dying and being reincarnated and study-
ing until he attains a state of perfection.
Having reached this state, he lives to teach
others, though what he teaches is also left
unexplained. The Mahatma idea seems to be a
development of the old-time notion that the way
to attain wisdom was to lead a lonesome existence
in a tub, and discharge sour and abusive epigrams
at passers-by.
« « «
Mrs. Besant claims that the existence of
Mahatmas is absolutely proved because the late
Blavatsky has seen them, and Colonel Olcott has
seen them, and she has seen them herself. The
general opinion is that the lamented Blavatsky
was capable of saying that she had seen anything,
and that Colonel Olcott was capable of seeing any-
thing. As for Mrs. Besant herself, she has doubt-
less seen somebody who said he was a Mahatma.
Up to date, it would appear that Mrs. Besant
doesn’t believe in the old material devil, yet he has
also been seen by thousands of apparently honest,
though rather idiotic, witnesses. So has the
sea-serpent, and the Flying Dutchman, and the
weeping ghost of Pontius Pilate, and the Wander-
ing Jew. Altogether the lecture on “Mahat-
mas ” was a disappointment, and the news that
the way to become a Mahatma is to go out and
meditate for years in a damp forest, and become a
long-haired and taloned wild man of the woods, is
so depressing that no one save a confirmed loafer
is likely ever to take to the business. Moreover,
the man who leads a nomadic existence in the
woods generally becomes a naked lunatic instead
of a seer, and is captured at last by the police
because his feet get entangled in his beard when
he tries to run away.
** * *
Messrs. Abell and Klaer’s circus, which
has taken up its location in Redfern, Sydney, is a
very middling circus in all the ordinary essentials
of the business, but in the matter of monkeys and
dogs it is certainly pre-eminent. Our unfinished
forefathers are the main features of the pro-
gramme, and their unwonted brilliance lends an
air of novelty to the business, for which this paper
is duly grateful.
** * *
“ Sowing the Wind,” although as improper
as “Mrs. Tanqueray ” in some respects, was the
most popular success of the B. and B. season at
Melb. Princess’s. By dating his play a good 60
years back Sydney Grundy took the edge off its
pungency. Time seems to have mellowed his
fruity incidents, and, like old port, they warm the
heart without burning the throat. Naughty Helen
Gray, the heroine’s mother, died six weeks before
the curtain rose, anyway. The characters who so
frankly discuss her buried shame must, in the
ordinary course of nature, have been buried them-
selves ere this. Consequently, the sassiety that
objected to the modernness of Paula Tanqueray’s
frailty is not necessarily shocked at Mr. Grundy’s
piece. Even a dress-circle may pardon the errors
of long age, and if a strong dose of declamation
be offered to the “young person ” retrospectively,
so to speak, she is entitled to swallow it and
smack her ruby lips afterwards.
* * *
The 8.8. performance in “ Sowing the
Wind” did not advance much nearer to perfection
as the week went on. Mrs. Brough and
Titheradge, asserting the wrongs and rights of sex
and sex, made far too much noise. They raised
their voices one against t’other, as though they
were arguing the point before a deaf referee, and
expected him to decide in favor of the sex that
shouted the louder. Mrs, Brough won. When
she fired off the name of Helen Grey poor
Titheradge could raise no more thunder. He
replied with a feeble gurgle in the throat, and was
carried off to bed. Melbourne looks forward to
more “Sowing the Wind” at some future time.
This, the closing week of the season, was set
apart for short revivals, and “ The Amazons ” is
the bill for the last two nights. Herein Mrs,
Brough makes her farewell appearances in Mel-
bourne before paying a complimentary visit to thei
land of her birth.

“ Morocco Bound,” from Sydney, will be
set up at the Princess’ on Saturday, with old
friend Elton and Wilfred Shine to the fore, as.
before.

A sad and thoughtful contemplation of
“The Bush King,’’ at Melb. Royal, moves the
present writer to mistrust certain statements as to.
its London success. London can stand a good
many things in the melodrama line, but the cock-
ney gods have been known to heave turnips at
entertainments not inferior to this. There is
plenty of plot in “ The Bush King.’’ The rush of
senseless murders, unexpected appearances, and
absurdity in general is well sustained, but as
much may be said of a Punch and Judy show.
The young Australian author in this case has no.
apparent idea of constructing a powerful situation,,
whilst his dialogue is balderdash without an occa-
sional pinch of ginger to fortify it. Moreover, he
is strictly humourless, and his most original senti-
ment deals with young Australian anxiety to.
“unfurl the British flag” in the face of Britain’s
foes. “The Bush -King ” will not be wanted for
more than a week—in fact, such libels upon local
literary ability are not wanted at all. On Satur-
day the same co. will apply themselves to “The
Irishman,” another new drama.
The Alhambra variety show ended a long
struggle with adversity on Saturday last, and the
iron gates of Frank Clarke’s temple are closed for
the present. Meantime Coghill Bros, are rolling
in silver at the Oxford, nee Gaiety; and the Bijou
Theatre upstairs has definitely arranged to open
on the 13th.

A slight smattering of audience was
apparent at Melb. Alexandra when Inigo Tyrrell
introduced a Russian tragedy in seven distinct
bits. The curtain is down, generally speaking,
during the course of Inigo’s latest, but each time
that the tragedy bursts into view it betrays
lavish tendencies in the matter of scenery and
soldiers. “The Czar’s Decree” is an imposing,
though fitful, production at the price. Augustus
Glover has been specially engaged to persecute
the Jews in St. Petersburg, and the cries
of the Chosen People as they flee from
a Christian pork - butcher who wants to make
them devour pig’s feet, are something terrible.
The pork butcher forms only a passing incident,
however. Glover is the real villain of the piece.
He murders a Hebrew banker and bowstrings the
widow of his victim, after which he charges their
orphan daughter, a sweet girl in top boots, with
the crime. Glover is finally overtaken by the
Czar’s Hypnotic Deputy, who forces him to
confess all in a mesmeric trance. When several
faint visions have appeared in the trunk of a tree,
the trunk leans over towards the criminal’s head,
and a missing document meets his eye. This
settles Augustus, so the persecuted Jews return to
their homes in peace. Business at the Alexandra
will not result in many more spectacular dramas,
unless the management intends to hang on until
the auditorium is absolutely empty at 8 p.m.

Stage dogs are unlucky. Only the other day this paper
regretfully obituarised the bull-slut in “Morocco Bound”
when that affectionate animal was mangled by a Sydney
tram. And now Stacey’s big St. Bernard, which has been
playing “Hans the Boatman” with great success in
Adelaide, has got underneath another tram, and gone
the way of all theatrical dogs.
Maggie Moore forwarded 50 tickets for her “ charity
matinbe,” at Sydney Royal, to the Deaf and Dumb
Asylum, but The Bulletin hears that the Mokanna of
that establishment refused to allow the children to go, as
he had seen the play (“ Struck Oil ”) and “did not con-
sider it fit tor children to witness I ”
H. J. Samuell, publisher of Herr Juncker’s song, “I
was Dreaming,” so successfully sung by Miss Nellie
Stewart in “Ma Mie Rosette,” has consented to pay Miss
Stewart a royalty of 3d. per copy on all copies sold by
him in Australia from Saturday last. Mr. Samuell
reckons that this will mean, at least, £5OO for the prima
donna’s share—not bad for a song which she sang without
consulting either publisher or composer.
The fact that Bentley was the first man to reduce the
wages of supers, scene-shifters, and door-keepers below
the recognised tariff will be remembered in Maoriland
long after the fact that he played “Richelieu” with a
powerful Scotch accent has been forgotten. The evil that
men do lives after them, but the interesting circumstance
that their French cardinal was obviously born at Falkirk
is oft interred with their bones.
B. and B. announce that Mrs. Brough is making her

Coghill Bros., at Melb. Oxford, advertised a new ballet

A correspondent writes The Bulletin that “ A well-
known young lady is in a terrible state because her idol,
a good-looking juvenile actor who had faithfully pro-
mised her all sorts of things, after he had succeeded in
gaining her young affections, &0., has married some one
else.” The statement that he succeeded in gaining her
young affections, &c., is a remarkably neat way of getting
over a remarkably difficult situation.
Mme. Christian retires finally from public life with the
farewell concert given to her in Melb. Town Hall,
She has been singing in Australia for 23 years—
her first appearance being at W. S. Lyster’s benefit con,
cert; after that she sang in conjunction with every noted
artist —Jenny Claus, Di Murska, Arabella Goddard,
Santley and Cowen ; with the last in 28 of the 30 oratorios
given by him during the Centennial Exhibition. She sang
with splendid voice in Mors et Vita a few months ago.
She retires because, as she succinctly says, “an artist
cannot live upon air.” The present style of entrepreneur
will not pay artists’ fees while he can get unproved singers
to spoil their voices at the rate of a few shillings a night.
For four years Mme. Christian has been in bad health.
Curiously enough, her first public appearance was, and
her last appearance will be, in a church. She was singing, as
a girl, in the Dockyard Church at Woolwich (Eng.), where
the organist was her music-master. The leading soprano
was suddenly taken ill, and she timidly volunteered to
take the part. W. S. Lyster was in the church, and
having heard her sing “Hear my Prayer,” made her an
offer to come to Australia. Her last appearance will bs
at St. Mary’s, Sydney.
Grattan Riggs is piloting Pollard’s juveniles through

Two of Maoriland’s principal cities have been theatri-

Plain Bill Holloway (writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent) begins his London campaign at Terry’s
Theatre, August 30, with “ The Foundlings.” His venture
is a risky one, for the play-going public have never quite
taken to Terry’s, and there is much in fashion.
Marie Elster and Josephs, the basso, have engaged to
join the coming variety company at Melbourne Bijou,
and the conjunction of these first-class concert names is
bound to draw people who don’t usually—haw!—patronise
“two, one, and sixpenny” shows. Miss Leslie Norman is
another strong card. John Gourlay comes forth as chief
comedian; also, a ballet of eight is in training for this
event.
A lady with a singularly thin voice gave the gallery
boys an opening on the first night of a recent Vie. per-
formance. The gods angcored her in the middle of her
verses r.nd shrieked in unison with her top notes, the
result bung a special advt. in next day’s papers that she
would take a night off. Whereupon the lady sent a
lawyer’s letter demanding £250 damages or an abject
apology, and the management put the indignant epistle
in a frame. The question as to whether a man who
engages an inferior vocalist to sing is justified in jeering
at her failure may be discussed in Court. In which case
the lady will probably produce a copy of an evening
paper containing a gorgeous notice of her “guyed ” per-
formance. The jammy “criticism ” was contemporaneous
with the managerial insult.
V.: “Now that Mrs. Brough is going ’Ome, it is open

Mendelssohn, the Melb. photoer, shows a mass of the

In the pictures they are smirking and holding up their

themselves in the marriage-market. The brainy party
goes to one extreme, and the leggy to another. Parents
would be agonised at the idea of any of these poll-parrots
becoming a Lethbridge or Grey. Even Mrs. Talfqwfat
entreats the principal of Melb. Presbyterian Ladies’ Col-
lege not to turn her girls into Melbas.
“ Struck Oil ” is the apotheosis of a much weaker piece,
entitled “The Deed, or Five Years Away,” from which it
was specially written up for J. C. Williamson and Maggie
Moore.
Geo. Majeroni, under the tuition of his mother, rapidly
advances. He plays a good part well at Melb. Royal.
When Patterson and Carter, with a big
majority at their backs in Yic. Assembly a
majority which was growing with almost every
bye-election—produced their famous “tariff re-
form ” Budget, S.M. Herald announced
that the great anti-Protectionist reaction had
begun. And when the House rejected the Budget,
and the Patterson party was utterly smashed at
the polls, and three Ministers were rejected, and
Patterson himself got in by the narrowest possible
shave, and the Labor party —which went solid for
high tariff—returned almost every one of its
candidates by a big majority, then the same
Herald put the announcement, in big letters, on
its placards : “ Great Victory for Tariff Reform.”
Eight Hour Day in Sydney was, in every
respect, a successful holiday—as, indeed, it
deserved to be, seeing with what earnestness the
problem of enjoyment was tackled. The Asso-
ciated Trades walked in procession through the
streets, making a gallant show ; and then went to
Rosehill racecourse for a day’s sports. Picnickers
swarmed the harbor resorts, and judging by the
dishevelled appearance of the stragglers who
filled the streets till nearly midnight the day
was celebrated most vigorously. One poor
woman with her hair down, and a baby on each
arm, paused opposite the post-office about 10 p.m.
to mop her forehead and call to her husband, who
was bringing up the baskets and the rest of the
family in the rear, “Well, George, my legs is
dead to the world, and I’m as wet with
sweat as a dish-clout, and the children’s
as tired as tired can be; but we’ve had
a real good time, haven’t we?” And the
wretched George, towing a procession of young
Australians which seemed to reach right down to
Circular Quay, admitted that it was so. Good,
valiant George ! Long may he live to share in
the pleasure brought by the holiday which shows
the Australian worker at his best, and commem-
orates the best triumph that his enterprise has
won.

FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and
impurities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic
purgative, but operate by perfectly natural means,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow
of bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharsis without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become suoh house-

We contend that this imitation is the sincerest

the genuine, bearing the name and address of F. M.

THE “LONE HAND” MINE.
“On 22nd Aug. the Day Dawn South public Battery cleaned up a crushing of 41 tons

The result was 6oz. 6dwts. per ton. Said claim, which was hardly known, is worked by
a man named Thomas Parks, with his wife at the windlass. They will nett about £1000
for their 18 months’ work.”— BULLETIN. corre[?]ondent.

HIS PARD: “Decide now—or down you go!”
The man’s hat fashionable in Melbourne
just now is called the “Rothschild ’’—perhaps in
graceful allusion to the condition of the com-
munity’s finances. Thirty years ago a German
named Muller killed an old gentleman named
Briggs in an English railway-carriage, and was
hanged. He was traced and identified by this
very kind of hat, which thereafter became odious
and was known as the “ Muller cut down.” It is
a sort of bell-topper in reduced circumstances.
It must not be forgotten that the medical
gentleman who is now doing so much to boom
Spiritualism in Sydney, wrote several columns in
The Bulletin to show that the Marble Man of
Cow Flat was, or had been, flesh and blood.
An old Sydney man asks us (as if we could
tell him) how it is that so many of the Agents-
General in London take to whisky-drinking. At
least two of them—and until recently three—are
usually to be found in the afternoon in a most un-
businesslike condition.

The day after his rejection for Morningfcon,
£ £ Smith drove down Oollins-street in an open
carriage-and-pair, with two liveried servants, his
wife and four infants in the trap, and a boy and
a girl riding on horseback alongside. It pays to
advise young men. Anyhow, it pays to advertise.
The Parkes who took the chair for Annie
Besant is the identical gentleman who refused to
allow Richard Anthony Proctor, the astronomer,
to deliver scientific lectures in Sydney on Sunday
nights. Had Mrs. Besant arrived a few years
back, Parkes would have had her roasted. The
old man is progressing.
Young D. L. Dow, who only lost the seat
of Kara-Kara (Vic.) by 20 votes, is a son of the
well-known Radical ex-M.L.A. and pressman,
“Jacky” Dow. D.L. is a mere youth of rather
distinguished appearance, and besides being a
politician born, is one of the most promising of
the younger Yio. painters.
Mr. Cruikshank, M.L.A. (N.S.W,), is to
marry Miss Ethel Clarke, second daughter of
Baronet Clarke, of Victoria. Mr. Cruikshank is
accounted the richest man in N.S.W. Assembly,
and owns about half the constituency he repre-
sents Inverell. He never speaks in the Assembly,
but he has evidently been talking to Miss Clarke.
Millionaire Angas, of S.A., is 71 on
Friday, Oct. 5. His father, who lived until past
90, arrogated to himself the title of “Father and
Founder of 5.A.,” and the family paid Edwin
Hodder to write a biography of the old man and
a history of the province, with a view of per-
petuating the claim. These books have been
circulated free among the country institutes of
S.A., but up to now old man Angas is not looked
upon as a George Washington.
For years Dr. Madden (now Vic. [Chief
Justice) regularly attended the and
floggings at Melb. Gaol. Once he took with him,
as a treat like, his father-in-law, Frank Stephen,
the attorney, to see a flagellation, but the per-
formance so sickened the poor old gentleman that
two reporters had to carry him out and dose him
with brandy. The other day C. J. Madden passed
his first death-sentence —on Jordan, the negro—
and last week ordered his first flogging, the tor-
tured one being a hapless youth of 18.
When N.S.W. Justice Foster retires,
which must be soon, Attorney-General Simpson
will have an outside chance of a seat on the
N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench. The Bulletin
says “outside chance,” because Mr. Simpson
must now be well on towards 60, and as it is quite
unlikely that he could face 15 years of Bench-
work (the period prescribed for voluntary retire-
ment on pension), it is not very probable that he
would take the post, for which he is otherwise
eminently fitted. Neither Salomons, Q.C., nor
Pilcher, Q.C., would take a judgeship, and though
C. B. Stephen would be a most eligible man, yet the
public don’t want any more Stephens on the Bench.
Probably the Govt.’s choice will ultimately rest
between Toby Barton and Frank Rogers. As to
the Attorney-Generalship, in the event of Mr.
Simpson going on the Bench, B. R. Wise, no
doubt, would have the offer, but he probably
would not accept, and, there being no other com-
petent Freetrader available, Premier Reid would
have to look to H. E. Cohen, who held a law-
office years ago, and who would no doubt consent
to go to the Upper House.
Ebenezer Ward, in a recent S.A. Legisla-
tive Council discussion, referred to farmer Russel]
as “the penultimate speaker.” Whereupon
Russell arose indignantly on a point of order, to
demand the withdrawal of the epithet. Squelched.
Grainger, inveighing against Women’s
Suffrage in S.A. Assembly: “Women are naturally
Conservative, and think of nothing but crinolines
babies and domestic servants.” Grainger, alas !
has had an experience of women enough to sour
anyone.
George Hawker, the
oldest and wealthiest
man in S.A. politics, has
added 500 breeding ewes
to his former gift 0 f
500 sheep to the village
settlers on the Mur-

in favor of the Kingston
Govt.’s progressive land-
tax, much to the dis-
gust of his brother pas-
toralists.
Martin Loughlin,
mining - speculator and
racing-man, died, the
other day, of paralysis,
in his 61st year, leaving
behind him 250,000 sovs.
of which 5000 go to
Mother Church as a
peace-offering. The first
time the present writer
saw Martin Loughlin the
latter was sitting at the
mouth of a shaft cutting
bread-and-meat with a
clasp - knife ; the last
time, Martin was sitting
in state at the Esplanade
Hotel, St. Kilda, where
he lived, enjoying the ex-
clusive services of old
Dan, once of Scott’s, the
best waiter who ever
carried a plate in Austra-
lasia. It was indeed a
change from the old BalJ
larat days to a cycle of
luxury and the daily
visits of the barber—for
Martin had his hair
curled regularly once
every 24 hours. Martin
Loughlin was a bachelor,
and a very close-fisted
bachelor, too. His life
presents no particular
moral—except, perhaps,
that in all turf and min-
ing transactions it pays
best to keep your mouth
shut.
lb was to the lately-deceased Dr. Black, of
Melb., that Salmon Wilson and his family owed
their first rise. When a N.S.W, squatter, he gave
Wilson and his brothers a letter to the Strachans
of the Western district, from whom the present
millionaires got work droving sheep to the Wim-
mera—a job so well performed that they received
a bonus in sheep, which formed the nucleus of
their fortunes.
Melbournian: “They run in all shapes.
Mentally I kodaked Premier Turner rushing for
his train the day he got the Premiership. Nobody
looked at him, nobody knew him —a commonplace,
smallish, fatty man, in a brown tweed suit, baggy
trousers, very short sac coat, and very low-
crowned pot hat. He had a parcel under his arm,
possibly a new pair of boots. How different from
the conventional type of prancing Berry, or
slinking Patterson, always in the chimney pot
and frock-coat! Patterson, though, is quite
radiant, not at all with a hang-dog look, and
makes a point of being on hand on the Block.”
That wealthy old oddity, Dr. Black, of
Melbourne, has left a will which much disturbs
the minds of his numerous descendants. He has
decreed that not one of them, save the daughter
with whom he lived, shall get a cent until his
youngest grandchild comes of age—some 13 years
hence—which is rough upon all those who came
of age years ago. Dr. Black was stone-deaf and
almost blind when he died. He had a special
aversion for Sleight, undertaker of St. Kilda, at
whom he used to shake his stick in the street and
call out, “You’re waiting for me, I know, but you
haven’t got mo yet.” But Sleight did get him at
last.


POLITICAL POINTS

Rumored that W.A. Premier Forrest will
shortly go to London as Agent-General.
N.S. Wales revenue from Ist January to
21st September was .£91,508 less than for a similar
period last year.
The new Vic. Parliament will contain 17
Roman Catholics. The fact denotes the decadence
of religious bigotry in Victoria.
Wise goes to England shortly—in a Privy
Council case. He will thus be conveniently absent
when old man Parkes starts to screw Reid.
The demand for police protection in
N.S.W. backblocks has caused over 200 constables
to be drawn from Sydney raetrop. district.
Five young Australian natives in the new
Vic. Ministry, also five lawyers ; eke two mossy
Conservatives. Good, bad and indifferent.
Will the youthful Best, Vic.’s new Minister
of Customs and Lands, persist in his elective
Ministries notion now that he is safe in the arms
of two fat portfolios ?
Premier Kingston (S.A.) is at least sincere
in his absentee-taxation proposals. He is attorney
for an English estate which draws thousands a
year in Adelaide rents.
• Old man Parkes feels the desertion of W.
U. Sutter as keenly as he did that of F. B. Sutter
some years ago. Parkes then said that all
deserters “deserved to be shot.”
Professedly democratic Maoriland Min-
isters Seddon, Ward, Reeves, M’Kenzie, and
Cadman have accepted the recommendation that
they take the title “ honorable ” for life.
The “South Australian Company,” which
draws tens of thousands of pounds every year out
of the province, gets all its printing, down to the
commonest memorandum-forms, done in London.
The Australian Star prefers a Governor

Premier Kingston states that the chief

The Queensland
lawyers’ trade-union has
raised the entrance-fee
for solicitors’ clerks from
.£lO to .£25, in order to
reduce the pressure of
competition and keep the
profession “select.”
Meanwhile, the 1a w-
brigade in the Assembly
votes strongly for abso-
lute freedom in the shear-
ing business, and ex-
presses its utter disgust
at the tactics of the
unionist shearers who try
to scare off competition
by pointing guns at in-
truders. If the union
shearers were allowed to
charge £25 for entrance-
fee they probably would
give up using guns ; and
if the lawyers were op-
pressed by absolute free
competition, and when-
ever they made any
trouble a Parliament of
shearers caine down on
them with a Peace Pre-
servation Act, they would
probably begin to practise
violence and intimida-
tion just as the wool-
remover is doing. There
is a lob of human nature

branchy of the shearing
profession he belongs to.

Patterson’s crowd, on resigning, said that

mu! now they are glad, &c.
Itwas the Australian-Irish vote that put
out Bryan O’Loghlen at Port Fairy. The
Australian-born R.C. youth, irrespective of
nationality of parentage, can’t be depended upon
t® cast his vote as Father O’Gilligan directs with
the certainty that his father did. This is what
bather O’G. calls the “spread of infidelity.”
G. H. Reid, as a barrister, defended
banker Abigail, and had a tremendous flare-up
with Judge Windeyer, re some points which he
claimed had been reserved, but upon which the
Court, at the instance of Judge Windeyer, refused
to allow argument. Mr. Reid is now Premier,
and holds Abigail’s case in the hollow of his hand.
When a young Radical with a very rich
Tory is given by that father a choice
between voting Tory and being absolutely dis-
inherited ; when, moreover, he is told that if he
again stands in the Democratic interest he will be
opposed at the poll, tooth and nail, by the old man
himself—well, no wonder that young man stands
down.
The Argus published a list of 42 candi-
dates for Yic. Assembly “ recommended ” by the
Freetrade party—most of them being Protec-
tionists all the same. Twenty-six out of the forty-
two were rejected, and among the throw-out were
seven members of the late House. So much for
the Argus’ discovery of a general outcry in favor
of a reduced tariff.
From the Question and Answer column of
Melb. Herald : —“Wager wishes to know, through
the medium of your valuable paper, who is heir to
the throne when the Queen dies.” Here is an
instance, apparently, of two or more loyal Aus-
tralians entertaining a strong feeling of attach-
ment to the Royal Family, but not quite clear
as to why the Western Plains echo “ God Bless
the Prince of Wales !”
Speaker Bent died fighting, at the bottom
of the poll, like a man. Bent is a man—not a
desirable man for Vic. Parliament —but a man,
nevertheless. He made as dignified a little speech
as he knew how to make when the groaning mob
allowed him to acknowledge his licking, and it
may_ be fairly said of T. Bent that nothing in his
public life befitted him better than his way of
leaving it.
There does not seem to have been the
faintest suggestion of venality about Speight’s
management of the railways. No line deviated
from the route originally planned; nothing was
done in the dark. Speight might have built less
substantial stations and less durable lines, but,
seeing that he was ordered to spend so much
money in a certain time, it is clear that the pre-
sent railway deficit must have existed under any
circumstances.
The great joke of the Yic. elections is
the plaintive cry of Brewer M'Cracken that he was
wantonly deceived by about 500 Deakinites, who
promised to give him their warm support. These
dissimulating ruffians cheered M'Cracken accord-
ing to promise, but gave their votes to Deakin.
Then, having voted for the other man, they came
forth from the polling-booths and cheered Mao.

Patterson, the pricked bladder, implores
his Castlernaine constituents to think of him nob
so much as the representative of a certain small
crowd (which he always was and ever will be) as a
member for Victoria at large. No purely little
local ticket will have any weight or influence with
him, he says. This, in view of the hordes of
Castlemainiacs who infest the public departments,
is a staggering statement.
Yic. Railway-minister Richardson’s crush-
ing defeat occasioned wild joy in the service.
When the news arrived at Spencer-street, the

one result of reforming the service by making

John Downer’s oft-repeated formula, when
he twits the Labor-members of S.A. Assembly
with their support of the Kingston Ministry, is ;
“ Don’t you think you went dirt-cheap!” The in-
ferential interrogation always being : “ Don’t yon
see _ how much more I could have given you ?”
This hint of a willingness to trim in the future, if
the fates are propitious, is inducing nervous Con-
servatives to cluster round Kingston, who is much
embarrassed by their support.”
Bryan O’Loghlen’s loss of his old seat in
Vic. Assembly was made more significant by the
victory of two Isaacs in up-country electorates.

S.A. Govt, did a smart thing over the
Beer Duty Act. The measure was assented to in
Ex. Council half an hour after it was passed, and
Customs officers were in the breweries an hour
later! Apropos. When the increased Probate
Duties Act was passed last year, Kingston got
word the same evening that a prominent million-
aire was dying. An Executive Council was held
at Adelaide Govt. House at 1 a.m. That million-
aire is still alive.

West (N.S.W.) were sworn in as special con-
stables, and ten of the crowd were armed with
rifles at State expense. In the strikes of recent
years, when unionists offered themselves as special
constables, their proffered services were jeeringly
refused, on the excuse that they were parties per-
sonally interested in the current industrial dis-
putes. But the meek and gentle blackleg is a pet
creature of quite another sort, and worthy of all
cheap honors.
Dear Bulletin, Please notice that
shearer delegate Toomey’s (Young, N.S.W.)
manifesto to the union men appears in the Melb.
and Sydney press under such headings as : “A
violent manifesto,” “An extraordinary mani-
festo,” “An insurrectionary document,” “A
daring manifesto.” The same papers print
Wingen Abbott’s lettef, advising his side to shoot,
and vigorously “lay a hundred or so of the pesti-
lent marauders low,” under the simple heading of
“ correspondence.”— Bilk.
One good result of Patterson’s primage
duty was that it oast a lot of light on importers’
profits. Sewing-machines are on the free list in
Victoria, and sell at somewhere about <£lo, and it
came as a shock to the public to learn that the
average cost landed in Melbourne is not quite <£2.
Freetrade in this instance seems to run prices up
500 per shent, and people are beginning to ask if
it wouldn’t be cheaper to put a prohibitive duty
on imported machines, and then try if the same
articles can’t be locally manufactured at .£4 or so.
The old-time Liberal and Protectionist,
R. D. Reid, who ousted M'Kinley from
gilt - edged Toorak, has, besides striking a
knock-out blow to Toryism in its headquarters,
also wiped out an old personal sore. Years ago,
Reid, at the time minister, was attacked by
M’Kinley’s organ, Melbourne Punch, and that
paper’s then clever cartoons and rhymes had much
to do with “Chinaman Bob’s” political extinction.
Now, some dozen years have passed, and Reid
arises out of oblivion, shifts M'Kinley from the
legislative saddle, and rides triumphant in his
place.
The Vic. pulpits have been ringing with
exhortations to the electors to choose only “men
of character.” The clergy seem to recognise only
one kind of sin as unfitting a man for public life—
viz., sexual indiscretion. A candidate may have
been a cheating company-monger, a Stock
Exchange swindler, a cause of the ruin of thou-
sands of honest people, and the pulpits let him
alone. But if he has ever been caught winking at
a woman in an unauthorised manner, the white
chokers begin to howl. The pulpits recognise only
one kind of “ morality.” A man may even own
brothels and still be a good church elder.
Parkes’ friends are not asleep. Concur-
rently with the old man’s notice on the Federa-
tion question in N.S.W. Assembly, the other
night, the circular-letter, recounting all the good
legislative deeds he is alleged to have done, again
found its way into the hands of such of the new
members as it might be likely to influence.
Apropos, it is said that a section of the Pro-
tectionists will be quite willing to follow Parkes
(who is willing to leave the present protective
duties untouched) when he moves. They reckon
on being thus enabled to shelve Dibbs and dish
Reid in one act.
The Reform Club, another ephemeral
device of Freetraders, has been “inaugurated ” in
Melbourne, by dear old Murray Smith. Every-
thing that Mr. M. Smith touches is bound to turn
to stone, but whilst this precious club idea is in
course of fossilisation it may be as well to observe
that Sargood Softgoods figures as chief man on
the committee appointed to draw up a “ constitu-
tion,” and that this bebaubled importer is a mem-
ber of the Turner Ministry. The fact that
Sargood is brandishing a Reform Club in the face
of the Labor-party will not tend to make poor
Turner’s head lie easy in his crown.
“ We suppose that, without undue egotism,
the result may be largely ascribed to the per-
sistence with which this journal has placed the
national aspect of the case before the community”
(Melb. Argus on the result of the elections). The
supposition of the fatuous Tory journal is quite
correct. By persistently pleading for Patterson
and Freetrade it made the truculent meat-man
deader than he would naturally have become, and
induced Protectionists to vote harder than they
had intended. Without egotism, the Argus oan
take credit for having assisted the Tory side to
lose, not the other week only, but always.
Parkes receives so many letters
sympathising with him on his being
in so dastardly a manner supplanted
by Reid that some of his friends
lately suggested a hostile hoax, and
indicated that the signatures should be
tested.
M'Coll, M. L. A.
(Vic.), avers that where
an industry has been
protected for a number
of years, and has failed
to establish itself so
that it can do without
such suppport, the duty
should be wiped out al-
together. Which is just
as intelligent as the
suggestion that where
a country has main-
tained a military and
naval defence force for
a number of years, and
has failed to get into
such a position that it
can defend itself with-
out a defence force, the
force ought to be abol-
ished. Also, seeing that
M'Coll has eaten steak
and onions for a large
number of years, and
yet has failed to estab-
lish himself so that he
can do without steak
and onions, therefore
his steak and onions
should be entirely
stopped.
Under the State Land Bank system in
Maoriland the law-costs in connection with each
mortgage are to be^reduced to about one-fourth of
the rates now ordinarily charged. The province
is already a rather unprofitable place for lawyers,
and soon the devil’s brigade will have to take to
pick-and-shovel work.
How many alleged Labor-members of last
N.S.W. Parliament, who failed to secure re-
election, have gone back to their original occupa-
tions . Very few. But to do so would emphati-
cally be the proper caper. Say you were sent
into Parliament by the wharf-lumpers and have
now been defeated. Get up next morning, assume
the garb of toil and go to the wharf in search of a
job. You will get rough chaff from the boys as
you once more stagger under the weight of the
bags of salt. But you will prove that Parliament
hasn’t “ demoralised ” you, and when next a
member is wanted you will be that member, unless
human-nature alters within three years.
The recent debate in N.S.W, Legislative
Council on the shearing trouble was a ludicrous
spectacle. One by one the members of the House
of Kidney Fits would stagger to their feet and
asthmatically gasp about “my sheep,” “my
°bP’” “my workmen,” “my shed,” “our agree-
ment,” “my station’’—with occasional allusions
bo those “lawless brutes,” “ruffianly insurreo-
tionaries, ’ and so on. When the democratically-
inclined Greville got up to point out that the
House represented Property and Property only
he was sooled down, and when he suggested that
members didn’t care a rap for public opinion ho
was energetically hear - bear’d by Property’s
stipendiary terrier, Jacob.
The Vic. Parliamentary Labor - party,
which reckons about 16 members and gives a
general support to Turner, demanded one repre-
sentative in the new Cabinet. But the Premier;
with the fear of his aristocratic constituency
before his eyes, shudderingly refused and offered
Trenwith the Chairmanship of Committees, which
was flatly rejected. George Turner is a respect-
able solicitor to the backbone, and hasn’t sense
enough to know that it is cheaper to muzzle his
most dangerous critic with a Postmaster-General-
ship than leave him at large to grab for the
Premiership later on. The Labor-party, anyhow,
can have little sympathy with a Premier who
dares not declare war to the knife against plural
voting.
The motion, lately carried in N.S.W,
Parliament against Premier Reid, for the winding-
up of the Superannuation Fund, is not kindly
looked upon by those civil-servants bordering on
60, who expected shortly to retire on comfortable
pensions. As they have been compulsory sub-
scribers to the fund since its institution, some
nine years back, under the impression that they
would reap some such benefit, it is only fair
that they should, at least, receive a refund of
the 4 per cent, regularly “docked” from their
salaries and paid into the fraudulent fund. An
amendment on the original motion to this effect,
however, was lost. The Labor members voted for
both the motion and the amendment. And yet
the average snivel-servant would rather die, or
wear a turned-down collar, than vote Labor.
The crowd collected before the Arous
office, inspecting the Vic. general election returns
the other night, was a characteristic one, very
orderly and dreadfully distressed. No cheering
and no footing, save from the enemies of the
“cause who had failed to get within seeing
distance of the Age’s hoarding. Now and then
one heard from knots of smothered fat men vague
and despondent murmurs about “shocks to the
country’s credit ” and “capital being driven out,”
but, on the whole, the crowd at ten o’clock was as
sober as a funeral, while that before the Age was
bursting with song and turbulent with triumph.
The fronts of the two buildings, too, wore eloquent
of the truth : out of every window of the Age
office hung bunches of grinning heads, but never
a man showed himself from the Argus, barring
the artist posting the returns, and he was so in-
flicted with the prevailing gloom that a mad wag
in the crowd was moved to hand him up a bunch
of crape.

There is a section of artists—in Tahiti—
who_ cultivate an annual custom known as a
“ private view,” which consists in throwing open
their studios just prior to the annual local art
society’s exhibition, and, after mentally deterio-
rating the visitors by libations of afternoon-tea,
there and then proceeding to explain the beauties of
their works to the helpless victims. Afterwards,
when the exhibition opens, the favoured few who
are in possession of esoteric beauties of these
pictures may be found explaining to other friends
details of “foreshortening,” “perspective,”
“atmosphere,” “tone,” &c. In fact, it is a
growing custom in that country to manufacture
public opinion about certain artists’ work, whether
it be good, bad, or indifferent, and it is sufficient
to notice this obnoxious custom in other countries
to prevent its introduction in Australia.

Dear Bulletin, —The steamers to and from
Maoriland do carry tough crowds at the present
low rates. On the Rotomahana’s last trip it was
customary for the “ push ” to rush the tables at
the first (dressing) bell, which is usually rung
15min. before meals. “Dressing,” however, was
regarded as a useless formality by the majority
who wished to get to dinner at once; so, after
“harpooning” the dessert, by way of a start,
they speedily devastated all else. One young
fellow wanted to know why the Sheol they gave
him soup in the middle of his blanky dinner.
This young man, a fine specimen physically, bound
for Coolgardie, loaded himself up with everything
in reach, and after finishing the solids he fixed his
eagle-eye on some prune-stones left on a plate by
his neighbor who had “cleared” shortly before.
These he scooped on to his own plate and pro-
ceeded to crack them with his teeth. After
assisting his jaw with a large horny hand, and
demolishing a few of them he remarked to me,
“Them’s blanky hard nuts, ain’t they mister?”
I agreed with him ; they were.—Tawhiao.

Dear Bulletin, —The professional pastry-
cook, when he makes certain varieties of cake,
always, for some occult reason or other, fastens a
paper to the bottom. Sometimes he uses a bit of
newspaper for the purpose, and then you get a lot
of valuable information along with the victuals.
The other day I came across this statement on the
bottom of a square piece of cake in a refreshment-
room : —“The deceased’s head had been nearly
severed from .... bowels protruded in various
places. A large hammer .... entrails. The
face was almost unrecognisable, and some clotted
hair . . . .” I didn’t feel as if I was taking any
cake just then, so I left. My opinion is that the
bowel and severed head business is being over-
done. —Yours, &c., T.S.

Extract from an Australian cookery-book
published in Melbourne :
I had a salmi of wild duck and a bottle of white wine
just before I sat down to write this chapter, and, behold
—what a good chapter it is I A good dinner warms the
heart, enlarges the intellect, brightens the eyes, improves
the complexion, sets a man at peace with this world, and
prepares him for the next, and conduces more than any-
thing else to promote universal good feeling. The Great
Founder of Christianity began His mission at a wedding-
breakfast and ended it at a supper with His chosen com-
panions. You cannot possibly get a better example.
In the way of cheerful egotism and unconscious
profanity even Brillat-Savarin hardly surpasses
this.

The huge crowd in front of Argus office
on election night prevented the adjacent chemist
from putting up his shutters, evidently out of

path. It was asafoetida. In five minutes the
path was clear, and at 5 a.m. next morning even

One amusing phase of S.A. retrenchment
is the appointment of police-troopers as public
vaccinators.
The loaves and fishes protruded in Melb.
Church of England Assembly the other day.
Bishop Goe put a lot of sarcasm into his assertion
that the clergy of Melb. diocese were as good as
gold, but apt to be heavy as lead. The obvious
retort no one dared to make, but Judge Hodges
laid himself badly open to Canon Potter’s home-
thrust. Mr. Potter wanted Melb. diocese to keep
its fat things for its own clergy, and Hodges went
for freetrade, whereupon Potter applied the sauce
to the gander, wanting to know why Hodges pro-
tested against Madden being made Chief Justice ?
Whereupon Hodges fairly foamed at the mouth.
Two_ things have goaded Potter and Co.—the
appointment of a Sydney parson to replace Mr.
Perks at Richmond, and the promotion of Canon
Langley, who came from Sydney years ago, to be
archdeacon.

Advt. from Sydney Daily Telegraph :
V"OUNO English Gentleman asks those of charitable
disposition for left-oil clothing. Destitute,
0.P.0.
“Destitute” is on an “old lay.” One of the
most profitable lines of metropolitan cadging is
the gratuitous acquirement of “old do’.” The
man in the big house who gives away tailor-made
clothing that he is too particular in taste to wear
does not know the value placed upon it by second-
hand dealers. But the professional cadger knows
all about it, and will sometimes even break the
creed of his laziness by chopping up a small pile
of wood in return for some cast-off garments (and
frequently some food and money as well). This
clothing goes to the second-hand dealer for cash.

Dear Bulletin, — What a mess was made
of the recent presentation of Humane Society’s
medals and certificates at Sydney Executive
Council room ! In the past such ceremonies have
taken place publicly at the Town Hall, but this
time the recipients were just hunted up by a
policeman, and each informed that he was
“ wanted ” at noon at the place already named.
For 35min. the three men whose “bravery and
humanity” were to be rewarded waited in an ante-
room to the Chamber, wherein sat Gov. Duff,
Premier Reid, and other members of Council. At
last, without the merest form of ceremony, the
three were called into the “presence.” The
Governor remained in his seat, and a clerk having
gabbled out the names, the medals and certificates
were handed over—without ever a word or a
shake-hands. There were no introductions, the
Councillors were discussing business all the time,
and the Governor—[ls this the courtesy N.S.W.
pays .£7OOO a year for?] —immediately got up,
and turning his back upon the company present,
began talking to Premier Reid. Which last action
went as near an insult as possible—quite enough
to make the three men wish they had never turned
up.—H.C.

Sydney has produced a prototype of
Dickens’ immortal Fagin. A pickpocket, arrested
the other day, was testified against by his pupils,
a girl of nine years and a boy of seven, to whom
he had given daily drill in the fine art of pocket-
picking. He had four “nicked” purses in his
possession, and a mild-mannered beak gave him
nine months during which to rest his hands and
practise delicacy of touch in the seclusion which
the prison grants. Apparently, however, to indent
apprentices to the pocket-picking profession is not
a crime recognisable by Law.

A poor N.S.W. country parson, after a
lifetime’s struggle with a large family and a small
stipend, got word the other day from England
that he had inherited a very big fortune. Six
days after receipt of the news he died.
Mrs. Harrison Lee told the she-males of
Adelaide W.C.T.U. that she disapproves of the
action of The Saviour in turning water into wine.
She also informed them that one step towards ex-
tinguishing the Social Evil would be to make
their children, whether boys or girls, sleep in
pyjamas. The good lady exhibited a divided-
skirt for the delectation of the meeting and asked
the men present to look the other way while she
explained how, by its use, innocent young pietists
will be able to preserve the Virtue which, in the
present style of dress, she says, is so easily spirited
away. “Oh, you naughty men!” she cried,
shaking an expostulatory finger at some of the
bald-pated parsons and other semi masculine
lovers of soft food present, “ I see you are looking
after all.” And so they were, though they pre-
tended not to be. They seemed disappointed,
too, because Mrs. Lee merely held up the garment
for inspection and did not slip off her skirts on the
stage and substitute the reformed-dress after the
fashion of Frank Thornton in “ Charley’s Aunt.”
Parson Berry delivered an address to the tabbies,
shortly afterwards, on a subject so very delicate
that allusion to it here TV absolutely impossible.'

Dear Bulletin, — Re Mrs. Besant and her
beans, doesn’t the diet of the late Mr. Nebuchad-
nezzar seem generally to lend itself to flatulence
of mind as well as of body?—to yearnings and
raauudorings which, by undue distension of the
self-consciousness, make for nebulosity of thought
and futility of action ? Fads, physical and
psychical, may come and go, but it is the omnivor-
ous man—bodily, intellectually, and morally—
who goes on for ever. Extremism, like every
abnormality, carries within itself the seeds of
reversion to the normal. The in medio maxim is
more than a mere crystal of human experience—it
is Nature’s universal lesson, writ large at every
turn.—i A. M.

Braidwood (N.S.W.), according to the
local paper, claims to own the smallest man on
earth, a citizen, aged 20, and 2ft. Sin. high. He
lives in seclusion on his father’s farm, and wears a
child’s petticoat, and passes, when seen at a dis-
tanoe, for an infant. A few weeks ago, he was
brought into the township and got his earliest
glimpse of civilisation. On that occasion he was
put into pants for the first time, but his modesty
insurrected against the new garment, and he
refused, with much forcible language, to appear
except in his petticoat. The spectacle of the
smallest man on earth objurgating in a short
petticoat is pathetic, with a squalid kind of pathos,
and makes one feel that the scheme of creation has
gone wrong somewhere or other, though it is
difficult to say exactly where.

Some few days ago a newsagent was
charged in a Sydney police - court with steal-
ing a bundle of newspapers. Three of the
dailies only mentioned him in a line or two,
but the S.M. Herald spread itself over the
dreary incident in half-a-column or more, and
gave every uninteresting fact i n full. The obvious
reason for all this was the careful ly-stated fact
that there were about 170 Heralds in the stolen
parcel and about 80 Telegraphs, so the incident
was an “ad.” for the circulation of the elder
organ. Then the D.T. gets level by announcing
that complaints had been received about certain
unprincipled agents who “surreptitiously” leave
the Herald at the subscriber’s door instead of the
Telegraph, and asking anyone who has been
“victimised ” by this nefarious practice to report
the same. The innuendo, of course, is that the
Herald has to be left “surreptitiously,” and
that if it were left openly there would be blood-
shed.

The Saxon and the Celt agree on one thing

Auckland (M.L.) Y.M.C.A. held a tearful
meeting a few days back for the purpose of slob-
bering over two young ladies who were departing
as missionaries—one to China and the other to the.
Niger region. Twenty saved Chow brethren were
on the platform, looking with the eye of the flesh
on their missionary girl, who was plump and
pleasant of aspect; and the premises were deco-
rated with streamers and Chinese mottoes. Amid
the general hysterics a large num-
ber of young women volunteered
to join the missionary move-
ment, and more are expected.
It is a curious circumstance
that the job of saving the
stolid Mongol is so larg< ly left
to the female hystericist, while
the male expounder keeps the
South Seas and other pleasant
stations mainly to himself.
There are few profitable open-
ings for trade in the land
of Joss, and there is very
little scenery ; and the society,
especially in the interior, is
limited, and the language is
difficult, and there is no land
speculation to be dene, and
the people are stony and un-
sympathetic and their desire
to kill the “ foreign devil ” is
ineradicable. Therefore the
male preacher snatches lather at
the pleasant billets in the islands,
and reaves the Chinese vineyard,
as much as possible, to the lady
disciple. As for the misguided
and over - enthusiastic lady dis
ciple, she has to take whatever
job she can get, and the rockiest,
most barren, and least profitable
corner of the vineyard generally
comes in her way. She is sent out,
with the blessing of the impressive
fathers of the church, wherever the
, heaviest spiritual shovelling is to be
I done, and there is the least chance of
getting any money or any converts, and the best
chance of being stoned by an indignant mob, or
hugged to the breast of the leper. Those males
who go with her are mostly amateur enthusiasts
like herself. The old, experienced professional
missionary knows better.

Miss LEONORR OHELLI (a coming pring-donna—from
Victoria, as usual.
Miss Leonora Orelli, an Italian on the
parental side, is an Australian by virtue of having
been born in Bourke-st., Melbourne, 19 years
ago. Her infant cry soon developed musical
tendencies, and, when Miss Orelli had worked her
way along to bashful 15, she possessed a voice for
which the late Madame Chambers prophesied a
“grand future.” It is a mezzo-soprano organ of
wonderful range, but, although Miss Orelli has
made four or five appearances in public, her vocal
powers have yet to make themselves fully under-
stood. Debuting at Melb. Athenaeum Hall, some
18 months ago, the young lady took a chill, and
when she sang soon afterwards at the Exhibition
she was feeling the approach of a rheumatic fever,
which nearly robbed the world of a nightingale.
This severe illness, happily, did not impair the
patient’s voice. Miss Orelli recently sang charm-
ingly the music of Casilda, in “The Gondoliers,”
and as she is steadily returning to her former state
of robust health she will, it is expected, lose no
more time in achieving a really great reputation.

Dear Bulletin, —Phil May’s sudden popu-
larity at ’Ome has stirred the Respectable press
of Australia to a state of appreciative enthusiasm
which gives the worker in art or literature “ that
tired feeling,” illustrating as it does the intellec-
tual crawlsomeness of the powers that be in the
offices of the “reputable ” organs, their incapacity
for conceiving an original opinion, and their readi-
ness to slavishly repeat the platitudes of the Hing-
lish critics once an Australian artist’s or writer’s
London success is certain. Mr. May, I know, is
not an Australian, but before coming here he was
comparatively unknown; whilst here he did a vast
amount of remarkably brilliant work, but the
“great journals,” so far as my knowledge goes,
never once ventured even to acknowledge hie
existence. After his return to England he sprang
into existence as a black-and-white artist at a
bound, and then he was discovered by the
courageous, self-reliant, daily paper editors of
Australia, and gushed over in the cant phrases of
their worshipped exemplars in the dear old mother
country. Note, too, the influence of English
theatrical criticism on the average “Australian”
critic, who invariably has the courage of the other
fellow’s conviction.—Snelu

Guy Boothby, the “great Australian
explorer,” who is credibly reported to have tra-
velled overland from Rockhampton to Bourke,
has written a book on his experiences, which are
varied and some of them very steep. The follow-
ing is his description of a ball at a Oloncurry
(Q.) hotel: —
The large dining-room was turned into a ballroom,
an accordeon supplied the music, and at least twenty
couples took the floor. As everyone knew and danced
with everybody, introductions were not needed. The
usual method of selecting the honor of a dance was to
approach the fair one and say, “Going to’ave a go-in?”
To which she would probably reply, “ My colonial 1” and
there you were! With gnat enthusiasm the ball was
kept rolling till nearly daylight, long after the accordeon
player was inebriated, and the music had dropped to
simple whistling. Bet ween the dances drinks were called
for, and not infrequently two gentlemen, having claimed
the same lady, would retire privately to decide the matter
out-ide, leaving the fair one to obtain another or await
the return of the victor, as she pleased. It was a proud
moment for her, and she invariably took advantage of it.

The difference between a High-churchman
and a Low-churchman resolves itself considerably
into a question of choir-singing. The high shep-
herd argues that a surpliced boy, with his
thoughts wandering nowhere in particular, is less
of an irreligious influence than a female soprano,
smirking at the tenor opposite, or receiving little
messages from the baritone at the back. _ The low
shepherd is all for girls in lieu of urchins—nice,
plump, ticklesome girls, who can gather round
him on practice nights, and walk down the dark
road with him on his way home, whereby he gets
the option of resisting temptation by not kissing
the little dears. If he yields to temptation it is
just as nice to feel sorry for what he has done, so,
one way and another, the Low Church policy is
girl. The lower the church and the narrower the
chapel the more girl you invariably find ’ n h . e
foreground. Come down to the Little Bethel,
and observe a cluster of volcanic virgins singing
on the steps.

S.S.: The case of the anti-vaccinationists stands thus: (1)
Vaccination is no preventive against smallpox ; (2) even if
vaccination is a preventive against smallpox, it is a dan-
gerous means of effecting the wholesale inoculation of
healthy subjects with blood diseases of a terrible nature ;
and (3) under no circumstances should it be made a crime
for a healthy subject to refuse to submit to vaccination,
which, like all other surgical operations, should be
entirely optional. Why, even a mangled man in a hos-
pital is generally given the choice of two alternatives.
“ Will you have the limb amputated ? If you don’t, you’ll
die.” Why not, therefore: “ Will you stand the risk of
an attack of smallpox, which may never come your way,
or will you be vaccinated and run the risk of tuberculosis,
syphilis, cancer, and so on?” C.M.: The cigar-trade

General Debility.
The term General Debility means a depletion (f
vital strength, a general break-up of the corporal
health, due to over-consumption and wasting away
of the life-giving constituents of the blood and
nerve tissue, really a wearing-out of the animal
structure. If your life is worth saving, it is worth
your while to treat your case thorougldy. If it is
worth your while to treat your disease at all, it is
worth your while to continue the treatment until
your health is thoroughly re-established ; you may
feel all right after the first few bottles of Clements
Tonic, so prompt are its remedial and curative
effects, but a medicine, no matter how good, cannot
banish disease in a week, the seeds of the complaint
will still remain in your system and break out
afresh, if you do not thoroughly eradicate them
Don’t forget that a relapse is twice as difficult to
cure as the original attack, so if you want to get
cured give the remedy a fair chance and recovery
is certain. Clements Tonic is a genuine article,
it is prepared for a specific purpose and contains
the material to make it an effectual remedy, and if
used faithfully it cannot fail. We do not claim
it is a cure-all, we do not say it will cure lockjaw
or bad spelling, but for all cases of impaired vital
strength it is a scientific and infallible specific.
Moreover, the cost of using it is so small you can
have a year’s course of it for less than you can
procure a week’s medical attendance, and a tenfold
better remedy than any physician can prescribe
for you. Thousands of cases have been cured by
Clements Tonic, and it will cure you if you give
it a fair chance. Read the case of Mr. James
Simmons, shearer, Junee Junction, who writes on
June 25th, 1893 Last year I was engaged
shearing on Marool, I had a severe attack of
palpitation of the heart, which rendered me at
times incapable of following my ordinary occupa-
tion. Even in the back-blocks Clements Tonic is
known. I was persuaded to try it, and by the
time I had used three bottles I was as well as ever
I had been in my life. My opinion is—it is the
best medicine in the world.—Yours sincerely,
James Simmons, shearer, Junee Junction, New
South Wales.

Miss Nellie Stewart, who, as Rosette, in the open-

song ‘I Was Dreaming.’ The song was so appro-
priate to the situation, and the fair artiste delivered
the melody with such purity of tone and attractive
vocal expression that the end of the song was
marked _ by a wild demonstration of approval.
The artiste responded, and, fired by the forceful
sympathy of the audience, she excelled her pre-
vious effort. Again the audience applauded to
* an( 3, when the son# had been given for
the third time, so continuous was the enthusiasm
that Miss Stewart had to consent to a triple
encore, a circumstance that testified to the excel-
lence of the performance of Miss Stewart, and the
pleasing character of Mr. Juncker’s composition.”

Mr Dear Moorabinda —
The first show held by the Art Society of
N.S.W. in the gloomy York-street rink opened
to an invitation crowd last Saturday, and
though the light might be a little better the
whole show was much more enjoyable than it
used to be when the Society’s stuffy garret in
Pitt-street, where even the paint used to melt
and no made-up woman dared show her nose for
more than five minutes at a time, was the place of
battle. 1 like a paint contest where there is one
daring daub to keep the shuttlecock of criticism
going, and Mr. “Sid.” Long’s impressionist oil,
“By Tranquil Waters,” is the sort of picture
which the “Lover of Art” and “ Constant Sub-
scriber ” are quite sure to quarrel about in the
newspapers. Mr. Long’s bold smearing will
attract everyone, but with varied effect. People
who like an artist to cross all his “ t’s,” will echo
the man who described the picture to me as
“Veal boys in a sea of ink and (it’s always the
fate of the pioneer) while the impressionable dis-
cover hidden beauties in the boy with the plum-
colored ribs, the other side will repeat the cynical
words of the unbeliever who said that though
“ Art is long, Long isn’t Art.”
Several ladies’ portraits trim the walls, and I
couldn’t help remarking that the idealised woman
is invariably depicted with most of her clothes off,
while the “ portrait of a lady ” is always dressed
to the very ear-lobes. Under these circumstances,
there is much to be said against cultivating
ideality in the chilblain season. The anaemic
“ Le Papillon ” is the picture of the idealised
female airily attired in a pair of wings and a
grappling-hook, but to my eye she looks the most
hopeless case of hip-disease that ever went head-
first into a surgical ward. Somehow or other the
woman who has her face or form painted (by some-
body else, I mean) generally is about the very last
woman who ought to have “sat,” and the cruel
part of it is that nearly every “ portrait of a lady”
is named in the catalogue. However, there are
some exceptions. The pretty wife of the Art
Society’s new president, Mrs. Reginald Bloxsome,
smiles at you out of her frame with a most natural
expression, and Mr. Tom Roberts’ “portrait of a
Sydney girl” (Miss Furlong) laughs charmingly
thro’ a bronze-colored veil. Mrs. Mary Stoddart’s
quaint portrait of little Muriel Carter struck me
as being the best and most natural piece of work
she has yet shown, and “ Master Rivers Allpress,”
by Diston —in some sort, a companion picture to
Mrs. Stoddart’s—represents with an equal merit of
simplicity a breezy-looking little fellow in a reefer
coat.
Like the rest of the world, I bow down before
Mr. Frank Mahony as an animal painter, but
when he perpetrated that unearthly pastel of the
girl with the staring, white face set in a frame of
tallowy hair, he must have been inspired thereto
by Dr. M’Carthy’s psychic photographs of
“Josephine” and “Cissie.” If I ever have my
speaking countenance immortalised, I hope it will
be done by a he-artist with a spice of gallantry at
the end of his brush, for it is evident that no dip-
lomatic woman would ever allow another woman
to draw a construction-line through her profile for
exhibition purposes. It seems to me that a woman
draws another woman too much on the unforgiving
Dutch principle, wrinkle for wrinkle. For in-
stance, one lady was painted with a shrimp-pink
nose, and when I looked up the catalogue—lo, I
found that she had been “ perpetrated ” by an
artistess.
The pictures were cleverly hung, but it was a
that put a nicely-colored piccaninny
and a half-caste in the same line with a fat white
baby. It looked like the evolution of the flabby
pale-faced infant aforesaid, which, judging by its
early avoirdupois, has already got J.P. or aider-
man written large all over it. Among the statu-
ary the only bust I was really interested in was
“The Bridegroom” (Prof. Anderson Stuart), (384),
looking very much at home in plaster of Paris
and placed back-to-back with an image of Bobbie
Burns. Even clay Scotchmen are clannish. But
I can’t think why that bridegroom was carved
with a folded sheet round his neck. It looked as
if he was getting his hair cut.
Apart from the National Gallery trustees, there
have been butt few buyers. The visit of Miss
Edith Walker, the Concord millionairess, to the
Gallery on Saturday came as a solitary ray of sun-
shine to the expectant brotherhood of the brush.
Miss Walker spent about Jll6O in half-a-dozen
pictures and, I think, got most excellent value for
her money.
I am afraid that the once Bohemian Sydney
artists are falling away into a sort of sartorial
Philistinism, or else why did so many of ’em turn
up to the private view in stove-pipe hats which
make a man look as if he went by steam ? The
modern martyr is a man in a black coat and a tall
hat, trying to gaze at a skied picture and keep his
silk hat on at the same time; and why artists, who
can, by the immemorial privilege of their profes-
sion, bo as as they like, deliberately re-
nounce their glorious prerogative of easy dressing
and try to look like so many tailor’s dummies is a
mystery to me. Julian Ashton, Full wood, and
Spence sported a becoming felt hat apiece, and
stood out from The crowd of stove-pipes who
looked like a WJie flock of Pitt-street stock-
brokenuin boom-time.
Further, even although no ladies were to be
pros,. n t. the f e |l mandate “evening dress” vm
i-i-ii. d (• >r the artists’ smoke-concert on Saturday
night. Is this one of the early effects of having a
society man—Mr. Bloxsome was once vice-regal
private secretary —for the president of the society ?

The monthly re-union given by Madame Lucien
Henry at her rooms, 289 Pitt-street, last Friday
evening, went off in great style. Madame Henry,
in a handsome gown of black and old gold satin,
opened proceedings With a well-delivered lecturette
on “La Fontaine,” and then came a little farce,
“La Lettre Changee,” in which Dr. Roth as an
amorous American and Miss Hannah Ackman as
a pert soubrette displayed good histrionic ability
and a convincing French accent. Songs further
enlivened the proceedings, and dainty refresh-
ments wound up an exceedingly well-managed
entertainment. A very large audience overflowed
into the corridors.
“ Ma Mie Rosette,” which filled Lyceum, gang-
ways and all, last Saturday evening, has one
serious defect, to my mind—there should cer-
tainly be a scene of Rosette taking large bites off
a pork-pie before she falls on the straw and dreams
the flighty dream of Act 11. An innocent village-
maiden who could get in so much visionary detail
without even a spoonful of lobster-salad to help
her is simply thrown away in an operetta.
Her r6le is to pursue apocryphal males into
imaginary solitudes and electrify the Sunday
newspapers with the way these ungentlemanly
shades carried on.
Nevertheless, regarded with the dewy eye of
sentiment, my dear Rosette is a very pretty show,
and any damsel who falls a victim to a monarch’s
wiles after sitting out the second act cannot plead
ignorance of the by-law, so to speak. Nellie
Stewart is a beauteous Rosette everywhere,
but when she pops out in gloss of white satin and
glimmer of pearls, with stagey garlands of lilies
of the valley, and her hair in a coryphee crop, she
is viewed in far and away the least becoming stage-
dress I have ever seen Miss Stewart adopt. But
in the abbreviated pink garment of the first and
last acts (Nellie’s self-confessed motto is “Show
as much ankle as you like, but keep a firm grip of
your lace tucker up above ”), and in the wing-
sleeved white crepon night-dress with jewelled
girdle, she was simply adorable. By the way,
everybody expected a more or less serpentine out-
line when Nellie got the limelight behind her in
those airy robes of night, but it was evidently the
clever trick to turn in with lace petticoats and
satin shoes and stockings at the Court of Henry
IV. Rosette had her arms a great deal too
chalky in the first act—they looked like the ten-
tacles of an arsenic-chewer—and I must also rise
and object to an operatic heroine who wipes her
eyes on her hair.
Wallace Brownlow (whose huskiness is, I am
sorry to see, becoming chronic), as the festive
monarch, struck me as being somewhat too
patently wicked —one of his bold, bad glances
would put a whole nunnery on the defensive. If
Mr. Brownlow has historic precedent to go upon
when he lets everybody see that he would like to
run a harem, then it must hare been much easier
to spot a “ gallant man ” in those days than it is
now—when you have to discover him as he hands
the plate in church with a face 2ft. long, or he is
seen heading a Sunday-school pic-nic down the
harbor. Even the most up-to-date Sabbath-school
wouldn’t give a free hand to a deacon looking as
W.B. looks when Nellie’s garments flutter in the
fore-ground; and it strikes me that a gay deceiver,
who doesn’t even assume a temporary air of virtue
from time to time, as the case demands, would
only bag the birds that tumble down at a blank
cartridge. Florence Young cuts a handsome
appearance as Corisande, but she really should
keep a sharper eye on her pronunciation. “He
has given her his portrit,” said she in the midst
of a sublime hush.
Nevertheless, I like “Ma Mie Rosette,” which
is one of the best-balanced operettas I have ever
seen. The music exactly expresses the situation
at all times, and it is a pleasant thing to have a
coherent plot set before you in place of the night-
mare of burlesque. By the way, Nellie Stewart
sings “I was Dreaming” (one of H. J. Samuell’s
publications) in the spicy act, but I don’t think
the gifted Juncker would know it for his own
after Rosette has done with it, for the words and
music are ingeniously twisted to fit the operatic
situation and the prima-donna’s high O.

Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, October 2.
In a cabled account of the Jap.-Chow sea-fight,
the Hi-Yei (Jap. training ship), which visited
Melbourne some time back, is mentioned as one
of the losses. Her officers, as some people will
remember, were nice fellows enough, though so
diminutive and juvenile in appearance as to be
known at local afternoon teas as the “ little boys
Brown ! ” Which reminds one of a chic “at
home,” given in their honor, when the daughters
of the house draped themselves in real Japanese
costumes, stuck little fans in their hair and chin-
chinned enthusiastically to the envy of girl-
friends. But embarrassment, rather than joy,
was writ large on the blushing faces of the gallant
guests. Later on, one of the mariners, a con-
scientious-looking youth, buttonholed the brother
of the masqueraders, whispering mysteriously,
“These young ladies have themselves mistaken to
wear thus garments. Such are sleeping dresses I ”
According to this, Mesdemoiselles Chrysanthe-
mum must court slumber in as high a state of
decoration as Ma Mie Rosette herself, or Mrs.
Brown-Potter’s Juliet. Imagine the feelings of
an Australian johnny, beholding on some heathen
shore the local cannibalesses got up to kill d,
VAnglaise, as they fondly imagined, in frilled
robes of Mrs. Caudle’s pattern.
The flannelette fiend has much nocturnal
hideousness to answer for, yet really, in these
burglarious days, elegance, rather than comfort,
should be a fair sleeper's sine qufl non. Not long
ago a suburban dame, cursed with a thirsty help-
mate, took refuge in a neighbor’s garden at mid-
night, where she drew the cork from her bottled-up
hysterics just outside the lady-help’s bedroom
window. The latter, clad in a scant pink robe,
and wildly pawing the air with hands encased in
black kid gloves, vamoosed her maiden-bower at a
bound and fell into the arms of paterfamilias, who
was running down the passage with the poker.
The luckless menial, condemned by day, as likely
as not, to scrub floors and black grates, was still
hoping against hope to keep her hands nice by
nightly penance, for the sake of the children’s
music and painting lessons.
But I’m forgetting the Japs. More than one
Melb. blockhead gave dire onenoe to the Hi-Yei
middies by talking in pigeon English to them.
We are as bad as our insular ancestors in this re-
spect, I’m afraid. Ages ago, a picturesque
Bananaland seaport used to carry on a cattle-trade
with New Caledonia, and one of the ships brought
back from Noumea a French husband and wife
who spoke English with quite correct fluency.
Nevertheless, the local inhabitants persisted in
addressing their visitors in a mixed dialect of
blackfellow, Chinese, and stage French. The
climax was reached when the Mayor, good plain
man, was heard remarking in a loud, explanatory
voice as he pointed to a banana or some other
tropical fruit (which, no doubt, the tourist-couple
knew quite as well as he did) —“ Carbon budgeree
—very good eat ’em—yousavee? bread-basket!”
This was too much even for the polite Frenchman,
who intimated in a well-chosen sentence that he
must draw the line at “ bread-basket ” on
Madame’s behalf.
A dejected handful of spectators, consisting
chiefly of the infants and nursemaids of neighbor-
ing professors, assembled at Wilson Hall to watch
the passing in review of a still more melancholy
group of youthful militaires, yclept the “Univer-
sity Corps.” The lads having been twitched,
squeezed, and buttoned into shape, like untidy
eight-year-olds, by their martial dry-nurse,
General Tulloch himself appeared, accompanied
by “ that sweet man ” grasswidower Penno, him
of the aesthetic handshake.
Dr. Bevan and family also arrived in the his-
toric “shay,” beaming upon all and sundry, like
the sanctified essence of Jingoism. It never
struck me before that the venerable Patriarch
models his appearance upon Dr. Dictionary
Johnson, which explains the why and wherefore
of those massy grey tresses, not at all a bad sub-
stitute for the great lexicographer’s wig. The
ordeal over, the General, artfully posing a tightly
clad and shapely leg on a higher step, addressed
the troops, laying on the jam so thickly that, in
spite of discipline, the military budlets sniggered
with self-approbation. Afterwards, however,
they had to march past a contingent of their
fellows, who, perhaps on the advice of the medical
students, administered a wholesome dose of firm,
but unkindly criticism.
Talking of “medicals,” these young gentlemen,
so frisky when well-backed up, are easily euchred
on a lone-hand. Not long ago, one of them, doing
his hospital course, was told off for the first time
to interview out-door patients. Among the
earliest arrivals was a buxom damsel, who seemed
quite at home and began by saying, “ You’ll want
to examine me, Dr 1” at the same time removing
her hat and jacket. The remark that perhaps a
vigorous inspection wouldn’t be necessary, and a
question regarding her symptoms, were brushed
aside with the statement that “Dr. Y. always did
so and so!” In spite of remonstrances, the “peel-
ing ” continued in such wholesale fashion that the
youth, now thoroughly alarmed, fled for counsel
to the veteran in charge. “Stop her, you
calf!” grunted old Sawbones. “I can’t,”
confessed the neophyte, reddening so apoplec-
tically that the chief took pity upon him,
and soon fixed things up. It’s always your old
doctor who prescribes falls off horseback for
maidenly sciatica, etc. Just as well, perhaps, as
it wouldn’t do to encourage girls like one of
Rhoda Broughton’s later heroines. This inter-
esting patient, not content with being perman-
ently bed-ridden, treasured it as her highest
ambition that she “one day might be counted
worthy of an operation !”
An orphan heiress, whose timid brother set her
a matrimonial example a few months back, has
just announced her engagement. The lucky man
—young, handsome, and possessed of a euphonious
double-barrelled name—is manager of one of the
ancestral stations. Deeply conscious of his com-
parative impecuniosity, he never told his love
until the other day, but his way of telling it at
last seems to have been a complete success.
It is whispered among the Toorak (Melb.) maids
and matrons that there is a tram-conductor on
that line who is heir to an English title and a
fortune. None of them seem to know which con-
ductor it is, but there is a manifest disposition to
“carry on ” with all the Toorak conductors indis-
criminately on the off-chance of getting the right
one. The consequence is that Toorak line con-
ductors are having a good time.
The recent sudden death of a flaxen-haired
Melbourne widow is said to have been really due
to a heart affection other than that of physical
nature. For years the lady had been the admired
of a popular city man who, at the last moment,
took to himself a much younger bride. This
decision is said to have caused painful disappoint-
ment to the elder lady, who sickened and died a
few hours after the disclosure.
Who says women can’t keep a secret? There
are a number of girls in South Melb. who call
themselves the D.M.L. Society, which organisa-
tion seems to exist solely to hold dances and pic-
nics, and, so far, no outsider has ever been able to
fathom the exact significance of the mystic letters.
Perhaps they mean “Don’t Marry Lata”
The latest bazaar notion is a signature-quilt,
upon which anyone can have a facsimile of his
signature embroidered at a cost of one shilling.
A unique specimen has the names of ordinary
mortals grouped round an emblazoned centrepiece,
which includes, among others, the autographs of
Talmage, evangelist M'Neill, Robert Reid, Mayor
Snowden, and Premier Reid (N.S.W.). The first-
named celebrity, when timidly requested to “sign
his name in a good cause,” fingered the provided
material (sateen) disparagingly, and made it evi-
dent that he didn’t consider the background rich
and rare enough for so illustrious an inscription.
Sassiety wonders how Westralia will suit ex-
Seoretary Ralston. It was Kismet, no doubt,
that he and his liege lord should part; but why
did the lot fall on the only member of the Hope-
toun suite with any looks to lose—those regions, by
all accounts, being ruinous to the complexion ? A 1
Victorian on a station over there, in a district
compared with which Coolgardie is damp, in-
dulges, nevertheless, in a daily wash, as he would
contrive to do were he banished to Dante’s
Inferno. But he atones for the extravagance by
conserving the water after use, and doling it out
to his blackboys to make their tea with.
A recent Salon lecture on life in North Queens-
land 20 years ago was illustrated by limelight
views, which couldn’t have played down to the
masses more candidly had the entertainment been
a Snazelle rational Sunday. The lecturer himself
almost invariably occupied a strong position in the
centre of his lantern-slides. He was depicted in
bright reds and blues grasping a revolver or two
in each hand, while tribes of ferocious blacks prac-
tised throwing the javelin at his dauntless heart.
When there were not natives to be held at bay
there were alligators to be driven back. Any pid.
tures which did not represent adventures of this
sort erred upon the side of being still awfuller
One was entitled “The blood-stained tent,” an*
other the “Cannibal camp.” It is needless to
describe them, but even Budge and Toddy couldn’t
have sighed for anything “bluggier.” Not that
it wasn’t amusing and interesting, though hardly
what one expects in the very stronghold of female
intellect.
Hand-shakes become more and more gymnastic.
At present everyone, not hopelessly homespun
rises on their toes in unison with the sweeping
arm curve. The effect aimed at is not a jerk nor
a bounce, but an almost imperceptible rise, fall
and rebound, like an inflated penny balloon bob-
bing very gently against a wall.
Ricordi and Co., of New Babylon, have sent me
half-a-dozen new songs of the love and longing
kind, all of them built for tenor or soprano, but
best adapted to the male darling, “ For the last
last time,” by Milton Wellings, is a pretty enough
composition, which gives the singer an oppor-
tunity to mention a heart throbbing loud with
Passion’s pain-capital P for Passion. Perhaps
the most fetching of the lot is “ In the Hush of
the Night,” a languorous Tosti ditty, words by
Frank Weatherly, A soulful drawing-room tenor,
singing this under circumstances favourable to a
mash, would be a very dangerous person, and I
don’t like to recommend it on that account
Filippo Filippi’s “O, Tell Me Why !” is a grace-
ful song, suited to any respectable soprano who
having been lately jilted by the boy of her heart’,
would like to know his reason for treating her
thus.
VAN M.
According to cablegrams, the Czar spends
his days in kidney-disease and his nights in weep-
ing. The parsoni cal press moralises painfully
over the common lot; and, in quoting the pathetic
lie that when the “Little Father!” heard bad
news of his consumptive son he cried, “God!
What have I done to be so severely punished ?”
gives no hint of the tortured victims of tyranny—
the executions, the floggings; the women stripped,
chained, knouted and outraged ; the quicksilver
mines, the Siberian hell, the choking of Liberty
with her own blood. There is nothing pathetic
about the agonies of mere common people, whose
fathers never robbed and murdered them into a
throne.
A. J. Thynne, the Q. delegate to the
Canadian pic-nic, makes out that barren festival
to have been even more useless than The Bulletin
considered it. He points out that the whole
thing was regarded in Canada as a dodge of the
Conservative Govt, to win votes for the coming
election •, that the Canadian newspapers reported
it in six-line pars., sprinkled among “street
brawls and suicides that Wilfred Laurier, the
brilliant leader of the Canadian Opposition, was
ignored all through; and that the whole thing
was a hole-and-corner conclave, debating in
secret, disagreeing in public, and ending in smoke.
The delegates discussed whether the German lady
who is titular head of the British Empire should
be called in future “Victoria, Queen of Great
Britain, Canada and Australia, and Empress of
India.” They did absolutely nothing else. Bub
Thynne, Suttor and Co. have had a marvellously
good time and oceans of champagne, and it only
remains for the taxpaying ass to rise and foot the
bills, as usual.
Dear Bulletin, — Your comments on the
breach between Q. Parliamentary Labour-party
and Opposition hardly do justice to the Labour
men, who object to help to quench the Opposi-
tionists’ ancient thirst for portfolios. Powers,
Drake, and Groom were much disappointed at nob
being included in the first callous Coalition
Government, and Drake was openly charged
recently by the Ool. Sec. with being anxious for a
portfolio in the existing “peculiarly vicious and
corrupt ring of public plunderers.” Powers is a
lover to this day of Kanaka labor, which he
believes is essential to the success of the sugar-
industry. He also believes in the principle under-
lying what you designated “ the biggest steal on
earth ” —the last Land - grab Railway scheme.
Powers only dissented from details, not from
the principle. Groom, in Parliament, is the
shiftiest politician in Queensland. In his own
paper, and on the public platform, but especially
in private conversation—" in strict confidence,
mind you”—he is an able, sturdy democrat.
Fogarty, another Oppositionist and senior mem-
ber for the same constituency as Groom, is
Groom’sman-Friday—apolitical apprentice learn-
ing his trade. Thorn, who succeeded Lovejoy for
Aubigny this year, was returned in the teeth of
Groom’s paper’s opposition—which has badly
soured the temper of the “Father of the House/’
Yet another remnant of the Griffith gang
was a adherent of the “ shuffler from
Wales.” He fished unsuccessfully for the Govern-
ment-printership, and never quarrels with the
off-chance of a billet. The remaining three or four
who professed to follow Powers, voted so con-
sistently with the Govt, that the only apparent
reasons why they sit on the Speaker’s left
are, first, because the Government bitterly
opposed Central Separation ; and, second, because
here is nob convenient accommodation on the
other side. _ The division-lists last session, and still
more for this one, show that the alleged Opposition
vote with the Government with sickening monotony.
The principal cause of Powers’ resignation was
undoubtedly the solid vote of the Labor 17 in five
divisions on the estimates three weeks ago, in
favor of the reduction of the high salaries. These
commenced with the Government House expenses
and included a reduction of pay for the
sinecure office of President of the Legislative
Council; also, the application of the One-man-
one-billet principle to the Clerk of the Assembly,
who is also secretary to the Board of Waterworks.
Not one' of the Opposition voted for these
reductions. When Hoolan held the Labor-party
leadership he took the honor very easy, and never
once made his power felt. Powers liked this
arrangement immensely, and as he played the
part of the Opposition in orthodox fashion the
Government also liked the “compact,” because
Powers having declared his intention of “nob
offering any factious opposition,” MT1 wraith
got on swimmingly. Hoolan would mix drinks
with the Government men—so he was a jolly good
follow. Glassey will nob even talk to them outside
formal matters, and always treats them as public
enemies. That is why Glassey is not liked.—

SPORTING NOTIONS'
Dear Bdllktin, —You say Giffen has a real
grievance with the Norwoods because they shut him out
of the Association, thus excluding him from the Cricket
Council. “ Considering what he has done for S.A.
cricket" Is all very well —but how about considering
what ids execrable temper has undone for Australian
cricket ? F.
Editor Bulletin,—** Herod ” objects to the
10 per cent, totalisator commission. He reckons this per-
centage big enough to kill betting. The machine kept
£990 at Adelaide races on the day he takes—does he
reckon that the bookmakers would have netted less?
With the totalisator 90 per cent, of the investments
always goes back to the public—but with the bookmaker
when the merry outsider catches the judge’s eye that 90
per cent, stays in the bag. It may be that the machine
spoils racing, and the spoilt racing may stop betting—but
that is not the fa" ■ f the percentage. It is because the
machine is honesi. a... horse-owners can't combine into
gwindiicates with it teat racing is discour ged. And
whose loss is that?—F.^
In the last Surrey-Lancashire match, which
ended in a tie, Richardson left a bruise on every one of
the Lancashire batsmen although the wicket was fairly
soft. Little Briggs got two successive boosters on the
thigh, another on the small of the back, and a flick on the
ear from a “ lightning delivery” that rose to the occasion.
The curious thing is that bulky W. G. Grace, who stands
well in front of his wicket, never gets maimed by the fast
bowiers. ,
Paddy M'Gowan’a funeral was three times as
long as Margin Loughlin’s.
The Hayes-Australasian case brought to light
a lot of the cunning of the clever jockey-boy. And they
are all alike. One of them, the son of a well-known
trainer, was given £6 by a bookmaker to ride a good and
fit horse “stiff,” but just before the race the boy
entrusted the “fiver ” to one of his juvenile mates to put
it on his (the jockey’s) mount. “You go to ,”
mentioning the bookie who had given him the money,
“ he’ll give you the longest odds.” The little deal gave
him a wager of £3O to nothing, which he won. But what

The death of the stallion, Oap-Apie, in Maori-
-1 md, revives an old yarn about the true pedigree of Car-
tune (Musket-Mersey). There is a man living at Otaki
( Vellington) who mysteriously hints that he knows all
about it, but stat ements of this character have to be taken
with a grain of salt, and are generally made over a pot of
beer. There is not much doubt about Musket being Car-
bine’s sire. Cap-k-pie sired a few fair horses, including
the champion one-eyed gunner, Despised.
* * • *
Pinrose (by the Musket horse, Hiko), who is
being backed for the New Zealand Cup, is, if anything,
smaller than Paris.
• * • *
Norton, Maoriland’s champion ’chaser, who is
coming to Australia, used to run in small hack-races
across the water at one time, and is a specimen of thp
“ hacks ” they breed in the North Island. A “ colonial ’*
pradin the next Liverpool Grand National will be some-
thing new, and the wealthy Gollan means it. He was
offered the boss hurdler, Liberator, for the same price as
he paid for Norton (£500) just before he went out and
won the Q.N. Hurdles at Christchurch, but he didn’t take
the owner at his word.
• • • •
The unpleasant Blackham-Tooher incident is
likely to be revived during the coming cricket-season.
The only way out of the difficulty is a full apology from
Blackham, and, considering that his playing-days are
over, he would be wise to back down.
• • • •
The revival in professional running will pro-
bably interfere with the amateur movement lately grow-
ing. Like Gordon’s “Mr.” Dick Neville, young Aus-
tralia likes to go “ for the pluuder.”

Another athletic club is mooted in Melb., with
Prof. Miller as the central figure.

Moule, the solicitor who beat ex-Speaker Bent

tralian cricketer who ever visited England, not even bar-
ring Giffen. , * ,
The Pattersonian candidate for a fashionable
Vic. constituency won a pot over Projectile’s win. Tht
numerous bank-clerks of his committee stood in, and by
squaring up shortages will be able to stave off the inevit-
able Coburg.

The A. J.S. Bank, Sydney, once prided itself on
possessing cracks who buttressed N.S.W. in the cricket-
field. Percy M'Donnell, now in Brisbane, runs a hides-
and-skins business for the Graziers’ Co.—whose manager
is a cricket enthusiast. Ferris threw over his native heath
for an alluring billet in a Bristol bank so as to play for
Gloucester in county cricket; and his bowling comrade
Turner (“ the terror ”) is no longer an officer of the A. J.S.
• • • ♦
A queer mistake was made at Port Adelaide
(S.A.) races Sep. 22. The totalisator windows are closed
when the gong is sounded announcing the start. ,For
some reason the gong did not sound in one race, and the
tote officials went on receiving money, in fact, several
cute sports actually planked their money on the winner
after the race was over and received a£3 Ss. div.l Even-
tually a pressman went and sounded the gong or those
officials would be receiving money now.

Following the example of the V.R.0., the
A.J.C. has resolved to give all the starting-machines a
trial before making a final selection. Gray’s worked well
at the Spring meeting. At next meeting a show will be
given to Tom Power’s, of S.M. Herald.
* * • *
Harry Evans, the cue-ist, wants to play Mem-
mott again, and in explanation of his former defeat
alleges that the table was tampered with.

Sydney’s two leviathans are gradually but surely
monopolising all the ante-post betting, especially in
respect to country clients.
Sydney Tatt.’s Club is considering whether it
would be advisable to reduce the present prohibitive
entrance lee of £250.

An Auckland (M.L.) owner, who used to race a
mare named Eve, has now three oolts in his stable called
Adam, Cain, and Abel.
* • * •
A valuable foal just dropped by Springtime
(dam of Harvester) to Trenton was lately stolen from Mr.
S. G. Cook’s paddocks at Loch (N.S.W.). Well, the
stealer daren’t proclaim the pedigree, and a racehorse is
not much without one unless he proves a good performer.
By the way, we have heard nothing of the mysteriously-
bred gallopers that have been expected around Mudgee
since Cranbrook was “ loaned” for a few weeks.
••• * ■
Q. Assembly having declined by 28 votes to 9 to
endorse the official order refusing transmission of ‘ ‘ sweep”
letters, Tattersall’s voluminous correspondence to Bris-
bane is to continue as usual. The Government is said to
contemplate comprehensive anti-gambling legislation. If
the Government is wise, it will attempt only to regulate,
not to suppress, the gambling spirit. But Q. Govern-
ment is merely discreet, and will probably, in its own
Interests, leave the question alone altogether.
• * * •
At the annual regatta of N.S.W. Rowing Asso-
ciation on Saturday, the North Shore R.C., as per usual,
wou the Senior Eights, but it did not prove the walk-over
North Shore got used to last season, as the S.R.O. pulled
a remarkably good race.
As might have been expected, Fitzsimmons
made short work of Dan Creedon in their recent meeting.
The cutty middleweight of the Creedon stamp has no
show with the new order of lengthy glove-fighter. When
Fogarty met Choynski in Sydney, the former thought he
had a show of getting close enough to land an auctioneer
of the sort which broke Charley Dunn’s massive jaw, but
he soon found the fallacy of any such idea, and very
sensibly threw up the game, telling the onlookers that it
was only foolishness to stand and be chopped to pieces.
* ♦ ♦ •
The chief feature, as affecting future events, of
Sydney Tattersall’s much-postponed Spring meeting, at
Bandwick, last Saturday, was Ruenalf’s win of the Spring
Handicap, which he took easily from Escapade ; and as it
is said Keys had half of Xattersall’s sweep-money, he must
have had a good win.

It would about break Tom Payton's heart

H. Breson won the 100 miles Road Race in

Before the leaders of the Turner party
were “sent for” by Gov. Hopetoun, they were
commanded to the sanctum of David Syme. The
Turner Government will be virtually under the
thumb of the Age. It was so with the Shiels
Ministry.
Even some of the friends of the defendant
in a big Australian law-suit are astonished at
the flagrant one-sidedness of the judge’s summing-
up, and there is talk amongst the legal profession
of a public indignation meeting being called to
protest against a judge practically taking an unpaid
brief for one of the parties to the suit which he is
trying.
Nothing can touch Cooper’s sheep-dip on
the show ground. At the big Chicago Fair, sheep
treated with this famous dip secured 330 awards;
at the Australasian Sheep Breeders’ 1894 show,
and at the British Royal Agricultural 1894 show
they were no less successful; and at Sydney 1894
Tasmanian stud sales over four-fifths of the sheep
catalogued were Cooper-dipped. Harrison, Jones
and Devlin are agents.
The Apex keyless watch, made at the
Beaucourt factory in France, has entered the
Australian market in earnest, and is-advertised at
igl post free to any address in Australasia —vide
page 18 of this week’s Bulletin. It is a stem
short-winder, has works equal to those of the best
.£8 silver or £2O gold watch, is set in an untarn-
ishable case, will stand the roughest usage, and is
altogether the cheapest, most reliable and best
popular watch ever made. The Beaucourt Watch
Co., Box, No, 686, Gener.J Post-office, Sydney,
will be glad to receive auu publish testimonials
from Australian buyers.
For the last five years the Sydney printing-
trade has been “ lower than ever.” Exactly how
much deeper into the mud it is going to get
nobody knows ; but if it gets any further there
may be “printing,” but certainly nothing worth
calling “ trade.” Things are cut very fine nowa-
days. Keen competition has made the profit
margin so small that you can —puff ! blow it
away, almost. Customers know their power, and
take a merciless advantage. It is quite ordinal V
fora dozen firms to be asked to tender for a jou
like 100 ball-programmes, worth about 25s. —“and
send a good lot of samples, mind !” And the
wretched firms do it. They have to; and they go
about on tenterhooks until the “committee ” has
decided “to give it ” —to the other fellow. Then
they console themselves by making out an esti-
mate for 1000 Bvo. circulars for somebody else.
But they have their revenge on the printers’ fur-
nisher. Crows on a slaughter-yard fence are mild
representatives of the furnishing travellers when
word goes round that So-and-so wants half -a-reamof
duplex. In the old days you couldn’t get half-reams.
Now you can get quarter-reams, quires, anything.
In fact, if it’s only a small job, the plan is to get
a dozen sample sheets from each of half-a-dozen
firms, and work the job on those. And, then, if
you want a good new line of type, and don’t care
to buy the font, you can always borrow it. So
there are compensations. The masters say the
compensations don’t go far enough, and have just
reduced jobbing hands’ rates from £3 to £2 12s.
for 48 hours. The £3 has only been earned as a
minimum during the last half-dozen years ; before
that it was £2 15s. The men offer to take £2
165., which is little enough to keep a family on ;
but the masters are desperate, and there has been
one lively lock-out already. Happy the score
or so at the top of the trade who will get their £3
whatever happens.

Editor Bulletin. —Will the proposed Queens-
land £lO stallion tax tend to improve the Dreed of horses?
It will not affect the light, weedy gallopers that stand at
high fees to supply the demands of the racecourse ; but
the powerful, slow horses which, because they hive not
speed enough to succeed on the turf, are sent early to
the stud before their legs are knocked to pieces or their
wind is hopelessly gone, will be lost as sires. Not being
performers, their services will not fetch more than 30s.
per mare, and it will not pay with the tax. Yet they
make the best sires for useful horses. What is wanted is
common sense in breeding. I once knew a squatter whose
ideal of a useful horse was a cross between a draught
mare and a Welsh pony. It gave substance and activity.
Of course, it did when it turned out right; otherwise a
mongrel. —Eqdks.

Why do the sporting scribes bore us through the
winter with their tiresome “ visits to the training-stables,”
so insipid since poor “ Augur ” retired from the business?
Well, it enables them when a despised outsider, never
mentioned in their criticism, gets home, to say: “ When
I saw him as a foal, two years ago, I wrote that the little
fellow would yet win a race if he kept on growing the
right way,”

House-to-house bookmaking is the latest

There is a lot of senseless hate displayed by one
Australian paper towards Corbett. Among other names,
it calls him a “ coward.” Well, he faced and beat Sulli-
van and Mitchell, the only other white man plucky
enough to face the Boston slugger in the zenith of his
fame—or infamy. He also faced Jackson without defeat,
and time and circ 'instances have since favored him. It
augurs ill for poor Peter when the people, who predicted
that he must go down before Slaviu, now “ barrack” for
him.

Apropos Matt Hardy, the old png., lately in Bal-
larat Benevolent Asylum. Here are the fates of some of
his contemporaries of the ring. Joe Kitchen died in the
Alfred Hospital, Sydney; Harry Sahara “ pegged out ”in
Melb. Benevolent Asylum ; Black Perry died in Melb.
Gaol. Alf. M‘Larencommittedsuicide with £lO in his pocket
on a voyage from Melbourne to Sydney. Bill Eccleston
died in Pentridge prison. Bob M'Laren, champion of
California, &0., died in his pub., the Glasgow Arms, Main
Road, Ballarat, but is buried, at his own request, in Melb.
general cemetery. Tom Curran is understood to be alive
keeping a pub. in Gippsland, and “ Bill ” Branch died at
Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, a wealthy bookmaker and race-
horsj owner.

Why should not “Ted.” Evans have an honorary
life-member’s ticket for the N.S.W. Cricket Association’s
ground? Has not he done quite as much for Australian
cricket as Banuerman, Coates, Garrett and Co.? Mr.
Evans was lately retrenched from the Civil Service and is
now, probably, a poor man.

A ragged, miserable-looking, and totally desti-
tute man was arrested lately in Auckland (M.L.) Public
Library for mutilating a newspaper file. The first im-
pression was that the poor wretch had been cutting out
an “ad.” relating to a vacant situation, but he hadn’t;
the stolen bit of paper contained the Melb. Cup betting
quotations. The officials were inclined at first to take
strong measures, but there was something so incongruous
about this tattered and bony object going round feebly
on two emaciated feet in search of betting quotations
that they set him down at last as a monomaniac, and
only ran him out.

The Royal Humane Society lately presented
two medals in Tasmania. One, to a laborer for gallantly
saving life ; the other to a schoolboy lor proficiency in
swimming exercises with reference to life - saving.
Apparently the same class of medal and certificate
was given in each case. What possible analogy justifies
this? In so vulgarising its badges, the Society does its
best to make them valueless.

Spofforth now occasionally plays for Hampstead,
and is qualified for Middlesex, though he is never called
upon to take a place in the county eleven. They say his
bowling is affected by a certain action of his elbow, which
destroys his accuracy. He is still irresistible against
second-class batting, and recently got seven wickets for
as many runs.

A few weeks ago a N.Q. parson, while ringing a

It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any

This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed

It is very palatable when taken internally, which places

The Caligraph Writing Machine.
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors. ’■ ■'
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that the platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When yon
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, yon
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their typ ■
out of perpendicular. Then remember that Urn
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

Round the Fire.
For The Bulletin.!
When the camp-fire leaps before us
Red and restless to the sky,
When the horse-bells chime in chorus
As the hobbled nags go by—
When the slanting moonbeams glisten
Down the grass-blades dewy-damp,
Then we lie awake and listen
To the strange tales of the camp.
Tales of the muster and tales of the mine,
Hunger and thirst on a Western track ;
Tales of horses and work and wine,
Danger and death in the far “out-back.”
Of a woman’s smile or a woman’s frown,
Of fortune scattered or fortune won;
Tales that will never be written down
So long as the seething world goes on.
Heap the blazing logs together,
Watch the red sparks climbing higher,
Scorn of Fate and scorn of weather
Holds the circle of the fire.
While the flames sheet wild and wide
Laugh and revel, one and all ;
Time to lay the mask aside
When the dead, grey ashes fall.
Tales of the sea and full tide on the bars,
Tales that are light with the lift of the brine,
Till the moan of the rigging, the plaint of the spars,
Is born of the night wind that rustles the pine—
Of a land that is further than all the seas,
Of a land that is ours by the fetter of blood;
And we lie and listen, and off the trees
We catch the snows in the moonlight flood.
Heap the blazing logs together.
Watch the red sparks climbing higher,
Scorn of Fate and scorn of weather
Holds the circle of the fire.
While the flames sheet wild and wide
Laugh and revel, one and all ;
Time to lay the mask aside
When the dead, grey, ashes fall.
GLENROWAN.
A Mauritius man recently received an
application for payment of a debt equivalent to
about Is. 2d., owing for repairs to a saddle., This
was the letter : —
Honored Sir,—I approach the throne of your honor’s
greatness and learning in the hopefulness that your belly
will yearn when he learns of myself, O, misfortune. Since
your honor’s greatness and glory have gone up there is
for me little works. Pultun sahibs (officers) and those of
police say to this poor damnable, "Go be dam.” YoUr
worship will thus know how I am poor, there coining no
works to me. Ever are my intestines void, and my wile
and female offsprings are laughstocked by all neighbor,
which your lordship may prevent by timely payment of
debt, viz., rupees one, annas eleven (I rupee II annas),
for which act of mercy and loving kindness like to that of
the Lord in the holly Bible, your humble petitioner will
day and night ever pray world without end for your
greatness and your lordships posthumous and spare
progeneys, and this dammed poor man will ever glory
hallilujah.

The successful removal of Piles of the

Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, large quan-

throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with

Tire good old copy-book theory that success
is the reward not of luck but of perseverance,
industry, and genius, gets some hard knocks now
and then. James Munro, ex-Premier, ex-Agent-
General, and ex-paper-millionaire, now potters
away in a little wooden office in a Melbourne
suburb selling £lO allotments and letting four-
roomed wooden cottages. He probably works
harder than he ever did before, and he has all the
brain he ever had, which isn’t much, but it does
him no good. His luck is gone, and it was all
he had to depend on. Matthew Davies is a rather
small and very ordinary solicitor now, and
from present appearances he will be a smaller
and even more ordinary solicitor by-and-bye.
About the brainiest financier ever known in N.S.
Wales now makes a precarious existence, in the
prime of his life, by doing odd jobs on the
wharves. He has six times the intellect of Munro
and Davies rolled together at their best, and the
only thing he wants is luck. But his mana has
departed, and his “ mozzle ”is out. The man
whose mozzle is out may have all the financial
capacity of all the Rothschilds and yet sell
vegetables on a barrow, and not have enough
spare cash to buy grease for the front wheel. And
the man whose mozzle is in may have no brains
worth speaking of, and yet may start 18 banks,
without any capital, and have a chance to retire
with a million if he only has enough sense to
seize it.

The Australian Cassowary .
The first cassowary described in Australia was
shot by a N.S.W. aboriginal (Galmarra, hailing
from Patrick’s Plains), who accompanied Ken-
nedy’s memorable expedition from Rockingham
Bay to Cape York in 1848.
In 1857, the first cassowary brought to Sydney
was landed there by Captain Devlin, of the cutter
Oberon. The bird came from the island of New
Britain, where the natives called it “Moorook.’’
The Australian cassowary is found only in
North Queensland on the east coast from the
Cardwell Range to Cape York. The Cardwell
blacks say the cassowary has rambled farther
south since the advent of the white man, and a
solitary bird may have even wandered along the
coast range, and through the scrubs of the Burde-
kin to within 12 miles of Charters Towers,
impelled by the same restless spirit that sent
Port Essington buffalo to the plains of the
Flinders. The cassowary is an inhabitant of the
dense tropical jungle that clothes from base to
summit the coast ranges of the Cape York Penin-
sula. This jungle also covers the level country
between the mountains and the seabeach from
Cardwell to Cooktown. It crosses the range and
extends, in places, for some distance on the
western slopes. The cassowary follows that
jungle to its outer edges, east and west. North
of Cooktown it inhabits the belts of jungle on the
east coast from Princess Charlotte Bay to New-
castle Bay. A full-grown cassowary stands from
five to six feet in height, and weighs from 150 to
2001bs. One shot by my son during the Bellenden-
Ker expedition, in 1889, and weighed in presence
of the Colonial Botanist, was 1841bs, This bird
is now in the Queensland Museum. The second
bird in the Museum was shot by me on the Barron
River, and weighed 1701 bs. One shot by John
Nairne on Fresh water Creek, near Cairns, weighed
2501bs., and I have seen specimens that must
have stood six feet six inches and weighed nearly
aooibs.
So large a bird requires an enormous quantity
of food, and a full-grown one must eat at least a
hundred pounds of fruit daily. Wild fruits of
many kinds grow in great abundance in the
scrubs inhabited by the cassowary. Every
bird has a favorite feeding - ground, and
comes year after year to some particular tree
or trees, generally the oil nut, pencil cedar, Om-
phaleus Cryptocarpus, or Davidsonian Plum. The
cassowary is also fond of the Burdekin Plum,
which grows alike on good soil and the open forest
sandy belts near the seabeach. About 20 different
fruits are eaten by the cassowaries on the Russell,
Mulgrave, Barron, and Daintree rivers. In cap-
tivity they are very impartial in their diet, display-
ing uncontrolled omnivorous propensities, and
swallowing with equal satisfaction boiled sweet
potatoes, raw liver, fresh eggs, dead rats, and
glass marbles. I never knew anything seriously
disorganise the epigastric region of a cassowary
except a tin of red lead. The digesting apparatus,
which yields excellent pepsine, is a large digestive
sac, not the ordinary gizzard of a bird. Connected
with this sac is a single large intestinal canal like
that of a tiger, and the digesting process is
effected with astonishing rapidity. All food is
imperfectly assimilated, the harder fruits occasion-
ally showing very trifling changes. Though
chiefly frugivorous, the wild cassowary also eats
beetles, rats, mice, young birds, tender bulbous
roots, and small fish stranded in floods or left in
evaporated pools. If man ever acquires the
appetite and digestion of the cassowary, the whole
human race will soon be exterminated by famine.
Even the best stuffed specimen gives but a poor
representation of this magnificent bird. The taxi-
dermist has, so far, failed to reproduce the
beautiful scarlet and orange colors, and marvel-
lous opalescent shades of light and dark blue on
the head and neck. Absent also are the proud,
imperious carriage, the measured, stately stride,
the sonorous ventriloquial voice, and the deep,
dusk fire of the dark, lustrous, malign eyes. The
two long wattles on the throat are found on both
male and female. Some are destitute of this
appendage, like one of those in our museum. On
the top of the head is a ridge-shaped helmet
about four or five inches in height, one of Nature’s
wonderful adaptations to the necessities of environ-
ment. Without that helmet a cassowary would
have to live in the open forest, for the lawyer vine
of the jungle would tear his head and neck to
pieces the first time he ran from an enemy. When
running in the dense scrub he extends his head
and neck in front in a horizontal position, and the
vines glide from his helmet on to his shoulder and
thence harmlessly along the plumage of the back.
When scared by a sudden surprise, the bird will
rush through the undergrowth with a noise like a
scrub bullock, tearing vines and breaking bushes,
but if he has sighted you quietly he will vanish
through the densest mass of tangled vegetation in
a manner apparently miraculous. He is a much
heavier and far more powerful bird than an emu,
and is dangerous to approach when wounded or
“bailed up.” One of the three toe-nails reaches
a length of over four inches, and I have seen a
cassowary tear the side out of a dog and disem-
bowel the animal with one kick. When two males
fight they spar like boxers and kick like lightning
in three directions —sideways, straight in front,
and out behind. I have seen two large birds
strike each other simultaneously, the recoil throw-
ing both on their backs.
At night they camp between the flanges at the
root of a tree, or stand, or crouch on the breast,
in a patch of lawyer vines or undergrowth. If
approached by a man with a bull’s-eye lantern
they will not attempt to run, and can be lassooed
or knocked down.
A full-grown cassowary has no fear of a dingo
or a tame dog. The first interview of a tame dog,
especially a conceited dog, with a cassowary, is a
comical spectacle. The dog suddenly sniffs the
unusual trail, makes a wild rush forward, catches
sight of a six-feet cassowary quietly picking up
pencil cedar plums, gives a sort of canine
“ Hooray ! here’s something grand 1” and ad-
vances to the charge with all the supercilious
arrogance which contemptuously under-estimates
the resources of an adversary. The next scene
shows an astonished and terror-stricken dog, with
no visible tail, flying for his life in a cloud of dead
leaves, pursued by a cassowary with his plumes
all standing- erect and a voice that sounds—to the
dog—like a fog-horn blown by Lucifer on the
shores of Acheron. When the cassowary is out
of sight the dog sneaks back to his master's heels
and meekly enquires, in the plain language of
looks, “ Did you see that red-headed earthquake ?”
The hen cassowary lays from two to six eggs on
the bare ground, usually in some secluded part of
the scrub, in a thicket of lawyers or stinging-tree,
and she and the male divide the responsibilities of
incubation, sitting alternately on the eggs for
about five weeks. After hatching, the young
birds are placed entirely under the control of the
male bird, and I have never seen the female in
charge of her family.
In three or four days the young birds are strong
enough to run at a considerable pace, and when
danger is announced they hide under logs, dive
into holes at the roots of trees, or squat in a heap
of leaves, and lie perfectly still until the old bird
calls them together. Up to two years of age the
plumage is grey, and thenceforth it darkens
to a bright black color at five years. Maturity
is attained in seven years. When out on the
ranges, on the north branch of the Mulgrave
River, in 1885, I saw a very large and beautiful
white cassowary, evidently an albino. He had no
wattles, nor any of the usual gorgeous colors on
the neck. This noble bird walked leisurely across
the dry bed of a watercourse, and vanished in the
dense brush.
The voice of the young birds is a plaintive
whistle; that of the grown bird varies from a deep
boom to a harsh hiss. He adopts this tone when
chasing a dog.
Cassowaries are very fond of bathing, and I
have frequently seen them plunging and fluttering
their plumes, and throwing somersaults in shallow
pools. Occasionally they are attacked and killed
by crocodiles. They are frequently caught and
drowned in the valleys by the sudden floods in the
creeks and rivers. Many were drowned on the
Mulgrave River in the floods of 1890. Several
bodies of large cassowaries were found after the
waters subsided.
On the Johnstone, Russell, Mulgrave, and Bar-
ron rivers, the cassowary is known to the blacks as
“Boondarra,” “Keendadja,” “Bomba,” “Boom-
boom,” and “Goombijan.” The bird is eaten in all
stages, from theeggstothe full-grown specimen. In
the tribe of “ Bolambi,” on the Mulgrave River, I
found one class had the cassowary as a totem, and,
of course, was prohibited from eating the egg or
the flesh. The class was named “Keendadja,”
after the bird.
The New Guinea natives make daggers and
butt-ends from the leg bones, and use the plumage
for decorative purposes. The North Queensland
natives rarely use the plumage, and make no use
of the bones. The cassowary accumulates an
immense amount of oil, especially from November
to March, and I have obtained six or seven quarts
from one bird. The skin is covered by fat and
very difficult to preserve. The oil rather increases
than prevents rust on articles of steel. It is
extremely effective on stiff joints or contracted
muscles.
Professor Owen regarded the cassowary as the
nearest living representative of the ancient Palap-
tei’yx, or Dinornis, a genus of extinct gigantic
birds which included the moa of New Zealand.
The present living representatives of the once
mighty order of Ratitce , are the African ostrich,
the South American rhea, the Australian emu,
the New Zealand apteryx, and the cassowary.
Two species of Dromaius (D. patricius and D.
gracilipes), contemporary with the Diprotoodon,
have been found on the Darling Downs, and
named by Mr. De Vis, of the Q. Museum, but no
fossil cassowary remains have been recognised in
Australia.—A. Meston, in a paper before the Q.
Royal Society.
A private letter from Fort Salisbury,
Mashonaland, mentions the interesting fact that
the parsons during the late Matabele slaughter
were by far the best butchers.

Faithfull Begg’s scheme for the formation of a
n Stock Conversion Trust” is apparently progressing.
At latest advices the Trust was nearly in order, and it
should shortly get to work on its contract of buying up
£2,000,000 worth of reconstructed deposits. Taking the
average prices in the various banks to be operated on—
the Victorian, National, City of Melbourne, A.J.S., Com-
mercial of Australia, London, and Q.N.B. —the lot should
be procured at 16s. 6d. all round, making a total loss to
the depositors of £350,000 when the final settlement
comes. Also, during the currency of the deposits some-
thing like £3,000,000 in interest, much of which would
otherwise have remained in Australia, will go to
England. The Stock Conversion Trust is not a very
lar”e affair, but still it is one more example of the
awful tendency of Australian money to go to England on
the smallest provocation and stay there. England is the
whirlpool which ultimately absorbs everything, and it
takes in t 1,000,000, or three-halfpence in copper, with
equal avidity. It is like the elephant which roots out and
carries away trees, or picks up a solitary pin with the
same calm acquisitiveness. Nothing is too big for it and
nothing is too small. It will grab a province on the land-
grant-railway principle with one hand, and it will take a
nigger’s cocoa-nut with the other, and it holds them
eoually fast when it has them.
H * ♦ « •
The Maoriland Government, which, a few days
&go, formally announced that the amalgamation of the
B.N.Z. and the Colonial Bank was practically arranged,
has now decided to prohibit said amalgamation alto-
gether. This either means that the Cabinet doesn’t
know its own mind, or that some new trouble has arisen
which is being kept dark. If no explanation is offered it
is an unfortunate “ ad.” for both banks.
* * * *
Creditors of busted banks may take a little
melancholy interest in the fact that a compounding share-
holder who can't pay his calls is left to arrange matters
with the bank’s solicitors. He makes an affidavit and the
bank signs an agreement, the cash result being—as shown
in a recent case—£l2 10s. for the insolvent financial insti-
tution, and “£4 4s. solicitors’ costs.” Sometimes, of
course, there is much more than £l2 10s. for the institu-
tion, but, on the other hand, if the unhappy shareholder
cannot raise more than a fiver the balance handed over by
the legal firm is exactly 16s. Which reminds The Bulle-
tin again that Matthew’ Davies should be doing a good
business in drawing up these little agreements between
his busted banks and their compromising shareholders.
Matthew, however, may be one of the more reasonable
practitioners who charge only £2 2s. for putting the for-
malities through. Meanwhile a learned Judge has, with
no consideration for the wants of his fraternity, “ sug-
gested that liquidators might make some less oppressive
arrangement w'ith solicitors for lower charges, or might
themselves furnish the necessary forms.” Unfortunately,
there are not many liquidators w ho desire to deprive their
legal pals of a job.

N.S.W. Auditor-General’s report toi Deo. 31,
’93, came out last week. Q. Auditor-General’s report
to June 30, ’94, was published more than three weeks
before. Financial criticism, to be useful, must be fresh:
and Treas. Reid might very well unravel some of the red
tape which clogs the wheels of his department.
The tardy report is a vast and complicated col-
lection of figures, with so many knots and tangles, sus-
pense accounts and reserve accounts, that a special
education is required to make definite head or tail of
them. The Auditor-General himself is not at all sure of
his whereabouts in the fog. Instead, for example, of
saying that the cash overdraft on consolidated revenue
account at Deo. 31 was £2,182,1.86, he says it “ appears to
have been ” £2,182,186. What comment w'ould a board
of bank directors make upon an account which showed a
customer “ apparently ” indebted to that tune ?
It doesn’t seem to be the Auditor-General’s
fault—his broom is powerless to sweep the Treasury
stable. His report is largely made up of details of con-
flicts with the Treasury officials, who manipulate the
public funds at their own sweet will in defiance of
Act of Parliament. Then the Auditor-General “dis-
allows” these proceedings—which last year involved
nearly £9o,ooo—and the Treasury officials practically tell
him to go and sit on the Act of Parliament. Then he
appeals to the Treasurer himself, and that intelligent
personage winders why on earth he can’t let things slide
and certify that the balance-sheet corresponds with the
books, like any other sensible auditor. So the Treasurer
hacks up his officials, and the Auditor-General sits on his
Act of Parliament, and weeps, and incorporates the cor-
resp mdenoe in his report, at which impotent revenge the
Tite Barnacles laugh consumedly. And things go on in
the same old groove.

The Robinson Gold-mining Co., Transvaal, says
the Mining and Engineering Journal, has the distinction
of operating the largest gold-mine in the world, if actual
gold-output be taken as a standard. The Treadwell
mine in Alaska is worked on a much larger scale and
produces a greater amount of ore, its last report showing
237,235 tons worked by 240 stamps, while the Robinson
last year ran only 60 stamps and crushed 94,842 tons of
ore. The exceedingly low grade of the Treadwell ore,
which produced a little less than $3 per ton, contrasts
with an average of about $17.50 per ton for the Robinson,
giving the latter the first place as a gold-producer. The
Robinson last year derived about 79 per cent, of
its production from the ore worked in the mill, 8 per
cent, from concentrates by chlorination, and 13 per
cent, from the re-working of tailings by the cyanide
process. The latter yielded a fair profit, though the
extraction was only 68.7 per cent, of the assay
value, a proportion which the company hopes to
increase. In this mine, which has the deepest workings
on the Witwatersrand, the proportion of pyritic to
free-milling ore is increasing very rapidly with depth,
and the report anticipates an early date when the free-
milling ore will entirely disappear. This can hardly be a
pleasant outlook for those Witwatersrand companies
which have based their expectations on the main reef of
which so much has been said. The Robinson is providing
for the future, and expects to extend the concentrating
plant and the use of the chlorination process, as well as
that of cyanide on the mill tailings.

English investments in Indian gold mining have
had varying results, but the shareholders of the leading
companies in Mysore, now the chief producing region,
have no reason for complaint. The Mysore Co. paid 50
per cent. div. last year, the same rate in 1892, 65 in ’9l,
and 75 per cent, in ’9O. The Nundydroog spent much
money last year in development and paid only 12J per
cent., but in 1892 it paid 28J, in 1891 25, and in 1890 19J
per cent. Holders of Ooregum ordinary have received in
four years 52J, 37J, 174, and 5 per cent., and preference
shares 62J, 474 i 27J-, and 15 per cent., 1893 thus showing
extraordinary results. The Champion Reef Co. paid only
10 per cent., but it paid off £50,000 outstanding deben-
tures. The Indian goldfields have not yet been fully
developed, and while there is no reason to expect any
extensive discoveries, it is possible that the production
may be considerably increased.

Dear Bulletin,— .Be tight places. How
do the following particulars of the recent killing of
old Bill Baird strike you ? Bill was well-known
in Cape York Peninsula as an explorer and pros-
Eector, and became celebrated chiefly through
is ownership of the best claim at Mount Romeo
tin-mines, where he made <£sooo. Unhappily,
Baird’s heart was better than his head, and when
he invested his earnings in a pub. his many
friends flocked round, and, what with lending
them money and joining in their carouses, the
cash soon vanished, and the old man had to take
to the bush once more. His last try for a recovery
was made about four months ago, on the Archer
River, Aided by two mates, he was digging a
trench when the niggers came on them with
spears, and one of them pinned Baird to the
bank. One man got speared right through the
body close to the heart, but, being a darkey, he
recovered, and, according to latest accounts, is
walking about Cooktown quite well. The
other man received a spear in the thigh. These
two got to their humpy about 200 yards distant,
stuck there for five days, and then started off to
the Mein telegraph station. Baird’s decomposed
body was found a week later by the Coen police in
the same position. He had succeeded in pulling
two spears out of his body and in taking off his
boots, so that he must have lived some time.
Just imagine the sufferings that man endured
roasting in the ground under the tropical sun, too
weak to get out, and without a drop of water to
quench his raging thirst! Add to this the mental
torture of the thought that the niggers would
return and mangle him, as is their custom, and
you have a situation that should |be well up on
your list of close fits. —B.D.S.
HOW A LOT OF MONEY LEAKS OUT.
What does a man do when he finds a hole in the
pocket where he carries his money? Anybody
can answer that question. He has it sewed up, of
course, directly—and good and strong, too. I
suppose it is with you just as it is with me. When
I spend money, even foolishly, I can tell where it
went, and maybe I’ve had some sort of pleasure
out of it. But Ido mortally hate to lose money;
lose it out and out, you know, and have no satis-
faction _ from it, or know how or when it left my
possession.
Well, now, let me show you the worst and biggest
hole any man ever had in his pocket; a hole
that lets the cash leak away like water through a
sieve, a hole that is the hardest in the world to
sew up. A short story will show it best.
“Drummore South Cottage,
“ Musselburgh, near Edinburgh,
“ September 16th, 1891.
“ Gentlemen, —Up to 1885 I was always strong
and healthy. About this time I began to feel bad.
I was tired, languid, dull, and listless, and every-
thing was a burden to me. I had no desire for
company, and what had come over me I could not
make out. My tongue and mouth were dry, and
I had a deal of phlegm on my stomach. The
whites of my eyes next became discolored and my
skin was yellow. I had no appetite, and after
eating I had great pain at my chest and sides, also
across my stomach. After a time the pain settled
in my left side, and my heart would beat and
jump in a manner that alarmed me. By-and-by I
got so weak that I was not able to go about the
house, and I felt that I ought to be in bed. The
pains at my side and stomach became so bad that
I had to remove my clothing (everything seemed
so tight), and I used to press my stomach and
hold my sides to try and ease the pain. Getting
worse, I saw a doctor at Musselburgh, and was
under him for three months, but his medicine
gave me no relief. After this I went to a clever
doctor at Preston Pans who said I was suffering
from indigestion and dyspepsia. He sent to
London for some celebrated medicine which was
packed in small phials. This medicine seemed to
dissolve my food, and I felt easier for a time, but
I gained no strength or real benefit, and after per-
severing with his treatment for six months, I
gave it up and fell into my old state. I next
went to a doctor at Musselburgh, but all his
medicines did me no good. After this I saw
another doctor (that is a fourth doctor), but with
the same result; none of them gave me anything
that reached my complaint. I now lost all faith
in physic, for I had spent a deal of money and
taken so much medicine * that I lost all my teeth
through it ’ and was no better for it. In great
misery I lingered on month after month, always
ailing, when in August of last year (1890), my
husband called at Mr. Jack’s Drug Stores, High-
street, Fisherrow, and told him what my condition
was. Mr. Jack gave him an account of the
wonderful cures he heard of from many of his
customers that had taken a medicine called
Seigel’s Syrup, and strongly recommended him to
bring me a bottle. He did so, and I commenced
taking the Syrup, and I found some relief from
the first bottle, and by the time I had taken four
bottles I was as well and strong as ever I was in
my life, and have since kept in good health. I tell
every one what Seigel’s Syrup has done for me.
‘I never thought to get better again, and I con-
sider it has saved my life. I wish others to know
this, and if by publishing this statement it will be
the means of helping others, as it helped me, you
can use this letter as you like. Yours truly
(Signed) Jemima Watson.”
Look back to about the middle of the above
letter and again read what the writer says; “I
had spent a deal of money for medicine.” Yes,
and money she could poorly afford to spare. Ill-
ness and the expense of illness is the great hole in
the pocket that I alluded to. It costs so much,
and what does it give us in return ? Pain, weari-
ness, and misery. There is another consideration
besides. When we are ill we not only have to
bear the increased outgo, but manage to meet
larger demands out of a decreased income. Our
candle is burning at both ends. “Yes,” you sav,
“ but how can we keep from falling ill ?” You
cannot always, but in view of the fact that most
illnesses arises from indigestion and dyspepsia, a
timely use of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup will
prevent it. A few shillings thus invested will
save pounds in money and perhaps months of
wretchedness. Think over the striking points in
Mrs. Watson’s excellent letter and you will think
the same.

A “Tight Placet”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Alonk —as a white man—on Bind Island ! I
didn’t like it. I was young. I had never taken
human life. My Arohipelagian experience had
lain hitherto amongst the Malaysian peoples—
reserved and punctilious. This sub-Papuan race,
demonstrative and vociferous, I didn’t under-
stand, and didn’t trust.
It was all very well in Ponderjohn’s company.
His reputation as a wizard was safeguard enough.
But now he was gone —off to Lukol with a Yankee
trader who had told him about a strange parrot.
“ A new edectus, my boy, if description goes for,
anything. I shall only be a couple of days away ;
and, meantime, let nobody near the collection, as
you value your life. Those coleoptera alone are
worth dying for.” .
Well, I didn’t suppose my life was in much
danger over his confounded beetles, but there were
other things Tumora might take a fancy to, and
about Mr. Tumora’s disposition Ponderjohn and
myself hadn’t agreed. Your ethnologist, as a
rule, is -a bad general physiognomist. So accus-
tomed is he to look for race-indications that he
becomes more or less incapable of individual
differentiation.
“Just the average Matabello-islander, • Ponder-
john said. “No better than the rest of them, and
no worse.”
I thought he was a good deal worse; and now, as
I saw him sauntering over through the sago-tree, I
stowed the rifle and one revolver away in a corner,
covered over with an atap. The other pistol I
loaded and put in my breast-pocket.
Tumora came in—through the roof! Bind
houses are all root, and the door is, perforce, in
the slope of the thatch. The chief looked all
around. At the birds, the snakes, the insect-cases,
the taxidermic implements on the little table.
These things impressed him; they were the
wizard’s ! But the wizard was away ; so Tumora
looked next at me, and icasn’t impressed—a slight
five-feet-nine to his burly six-one. He smiled
with childish vanity, and straightened himself up
in front of me—a portentous figure, with such
mass of muscle upon shoulder and arm as even a
pot-belly could not render insignificant. His
frizzy hair and beard were Papuan, pure, and,
though his skin had hardly more than Malay
depth of tint, his big, drop-ended nose again was
Papuan. Malay enough to carry a kris—the
hardwood club was clearly his accustomed weapon.
Nearly four feet long, with a head like a decent-
sized pumpkin—l found myself wondering whether
I could shoot before it could reach me. The chief
followed my look and hove the thing suddenly
above his head. To and fro he shook it with one
hand, twisted and twirled it this way and that,
till his big biceps stood nearly in a semi-circle, and
1 realised that I would have about as much chance
with him as a fly ! But all I said was—
“ That is nothing !”
The infantine Papuan nature showed up. VVith
a pettish grin he let the club drop. Then he
squatted on the floor and laughed. “ Would I
give him rum?” .
“ No, I wouldn’t!” Boldly, this—nut not with-
out misgivings. “ Would I show him my guns ?’’
“ My guns were gone with my ‘ father ’ to Lukol.”
That, my visitor frankly observed, was a lie! and
as frankly I acknowledged it. Then we both
laughed, and things began to look more promising.
I offered the giant a quarter-pound cake of such
tobacco as I had seen the Kd men smoke-black as
ink and strong as a team of bullocks. He smelt
at it in a puzzled kind of way, then stowed it away
in his hair. Next of course he was hungry, so I
gave him sago-cakes and dried turtle—half a-
dozen of the one and about a poimd of the other-
and the way it all disappeared made me thankful
he hadn t brought with him a tail of similar
performer. Tim thought .uggcted the quo.,ion
-why had he come alone ? , , . .
. “Because’— peering cautiously round and smk-
ing his guttural voice to a whisper—“ because he
wanted to see the Weather-Spirit.”
.. The fastened , n box _ thafc
tells thy ‘ father ’ what wind is going to blow, and
when the ram someth

aneroid barometer ? I brought it out.
Yes ! —sheering off to the end of the but and
keeping a watchful eye on the instrument. lhab
was the box—would I make the spirit speak ?
It couldnt speak, 1 explained. It could
only point. Ibis was its finger. , f
I umora scratched his head, felt
tobacco in his hair, drew it out, bit off a mouthful,
™allo"-ea terrible stuff u if It h.d teen
gingerbread • . . m. -
Here was a fresh complication. This sort of
po i son a rhinoceros! If Tumora
died-well, Ponderjohn had described to me a few
of the little amenities practised upon unfortunates
w b o W ere merely suspected of harming a chief. 1
and took another mouthful. T- hen be cautm'isly
be*
dub again> and delivered himself in execrable
Malay to the effect that I was an unworthy son of
my ..^ ather> « who spoke always truth ! In short,
j wag a u ar Q f tbe first water ! “ The spirit could
speak and if I wouldn’t ask it to do so’’—the
Y dj club said the resfc j
Should I shoo, him, . Thu time
was to come soon enough when I wou
dropped him without a wink but I had never yet
fired at Man I Ihe momentousness of the ac
held my hand and I I would ask
the spirit to speak, I said. But, as Tumora
doubtless knew, spirits were occasionally
“Go on !” he snarled. “Go on ! make the
spirit say wise words !
His deep-set eyes began to burn, his tee
gleamed viciously from the gloomy tangle of his
beard ; but the sweat-beads stood upon his scroll-
marked forehead, his breath came in snorts, the
brown of his devils countenance was turning
green. , „ T . „ A
Ihe tobacco 1 I told myself, and, even th
the thought, the fated wretch gulped down t e
remant of the plug. But he was d angerous still,
so, turning towards the barometer, I stretched o t
an arm over it and recited a verse or two of some-
thing-I forget what. Silence, then, for half-a-
minute—broken only by the poisoned mans
elephantine gaspings. , , •
“ The spirit ’-I began, and turned-barely in
time to duck beneath the tremendous swing with
fche cJub knocked Po „derjohn’s choicest
beetle-case to flinders and nearly shook the house
down as it landed like a round-shot upon one of
the marble-wood posts. Eight feet away I jumped,
and jerked the putol out. But ,t wasn t needed-
the effect had finished Tumora. Twisting and
groaning, he lay on the floor wetted already
with the sweat that poured from every inch of hi
agonised oaroase.
I made the door fast, pocketed the pistol again,
stooped over the enemy, and deliberately wrenched
him by the nose—slapped him hard in the face-
kicked him energetically in the ribs 1 Not out of
petty revenge, but to make sure that he really
was in the state of indifference to contingencies
characteristic of narcoto - irritant poisoning.
Then I lit my pipe and constituted myself an
Executive Council of One. This man had eaten
a 4oz. p'ng of about the strongest tobacco in the
world. His death —probable in any case —was
certain if he were left to himself. Should I use,
on his behalf, what medical knowledge I pos-
sessed ?
“ No !” I repeated, as I looked up at the saucer-
shaped dent of the club upon the massive house-
post. “ Better not give him the chance of repeat-
ing that little experiment ! Let the law—which
is to say the tobacco—take its course !”
Voices —many voices—outside. I opened the
door. There was a small crowd around it—jab-
bering and hustling each other as is this people’s
way. Not all, though. One old man, shorter
than the others, and lighter of color, stood gravely
forward as spokesman. He had made the Macas-
sar voyage, wore a kris, and spoke the Bugis
Malay intelligibly enough.
“Tumora was lost! The people were afraid !
Had the white master seen the great chief whose
name was Tumora-Dine ?”
The “ white master ” brought him in, closed the
door, and pointed to the deplorable object upon
the floor. “Tumora had angered the Weather-
Spirit of the white men, and the Spirit had turned
his blood into water !”
“ Avai Indail" and the old man shrunk away
towards the door. “It is even so ! Wise are the
white men ! Great is their Spirit 1 Let thy ser-
vant go, lest he also ”
I threw open the door, and waited while he
explained in the Bind tongue. In half-a-minute
there wasn’t a mop-head in sight—save one —a
nearly black man, who surlily stood his ground.
Tattooed from wrist to elbow in brilliant scarlet,
he swung carelessly to and fro the short, cauli-
flower-headed club of the Aru Islands. There
were Aru-men in Bind, I knew—fellows with more
grit than the Dind-men, or less superstition. This

“ Lucky for you you’ve got an Irish skull! That
tap would have crushed mine like an egg-shell.”
“Thanks! But why didn’t the fellow finish
me when he had me down ?”
“ Well, from what I can make out, your pistol
exploded as you fell, and he thought it was the
spirit that had bewitched Tumora, so he bolted
and left the chief here. They’ve only just taken
him away. What in creation did you give the
fellow ?”
“Tobacco! He ate a quarter-pound of that
black Amboyna !”
“Devil he did ! Well —listen !”
The infernal din from the village took definite
meaning now. The women were howling for the
death of a chief.

a barrier between the people and their tyrants, that real

He was a simple country-man
And wore a jovial smirk,
As at the member’s sanctum he
Inquired in search of work.
“ Work !” cried the M.P., “ look at me
As 1 sit here this day,
And you will see a man who has
Unaided made his way.
Then, go and do likewise yourself,
For surely you must know
You have the chances that I had
Some thirty years ago.”
The bushman gazed at him awhile
In silent contemplation,
And then he turned on him and gave
Vent to his indignation ;

“ So mean or under-handed.
