THE "OBSERVER" PLAYS
London “Observer’s” 1957 play-
competition brought in nearly 2000
plays, of which the seven preferred by
the judges make The Observer Plays
(Faber).
Literary competitions tend to be mis-
leading because so many judges know
what "they want, and that generally
means that they have seen it before, so
that a really new thing has to make its
own way, outside competitions. And in
this play-competition we have Kenneth
Tynan saying in his preface that the
judges (Alec Guiness, Peter Ustinov,
Peter Hall, and Michael Barry, head of
8.8. C. Television Drama) “hoped to
answer Arthur Miller’s charge that the
English theatre was ‘hermetically
sealed-otT’ from contemporary life.”
So they chose first a Trinidad play.
“Moon on a Rainbow Shawl,” by Errol
John, in which the hero’s girl goes to
bed with her old cafe-owner employer
because the hero is clearing out, and
the cafe-owner is charging her friend’s
husband with theft, and it’s all a big
mistake, anyway. It is so far in the
American “Street-car” tradition that the
hero is a tram-driver.
The second-prize went to “Sit on the
Earth,” by two women, Gurney Camp-
bell and Daphne Athas; a big fat
party-manager in the negro-segregation
section of the U.S. corrupts a virtuous
young man to betray his clergyman-
father’s confidence by denouncing the
sexual murder of a negro girl by a
member of the opposing political com-
mittee; he uses this to blackmail the
denouncee into changing sides—and
there is a sideplay of the fat old party-
manager’s horrible advances to the 17-
year-old girl he has brought in to live
at his hotel.
It seems likely that the judges were
not so keen on having plays of “con-
temporary life” as plays like those of
Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams;
and though both the first and second
plays are well constructed, and
although the women authors “dumb-
founded” Tynan (and the reviewer) with
their “salty, flamboyant gusto” (a good
deal of which would have to be left out
on a commercial stage), neither has yet
had a performance —maybe because
producers who want to produce a play
like Arthur Miller’s or Tennessee
Williams's would rather apply to those
gentlemen direct. Or maybe the public
has had too much of the kind of
“contemporary life” which involves
filling authors with champagne and
audiences with the dregs of despair . . .
It is fatal to prophesy about an
unproduced play. But at the same time,
Alec Guiness, says Tynan, wanted to
give first-prize to Beynon’s “Shifting
Heart,” which tied with Ann Jellicoe’s
“The Sport of My Mad Mother,” and
N. F. Simpson’s “A Resounding Tinkle”
for third place. And “The Shifting
Heart” (Sydney, October, 1957),
“Tinkle” (London, December, 1957;
one Sunday performance) and the
honorably-mentioned “All my Own
Work,” by Romilly Cavan (Bristol,
April, 1958) are all of the seven prize-
plays that have been produced; and,
granting that Gino dies in “The Shifting
Heart,” they are plays of good-cheer.
The good-cheer of “Tinkle,” how-
ever, is the kind in which the actors
come on stage, look surprisedly at the
audience, wonder how they are going
to entertain it. bring on a pair of come-
dians, hold a session of critics on the
performance —in short, corn. Miss
Cavan’s play is the well-tried recipe of
bringing a set of contrasting types and
classes together in a cellar or a mine,
holding them there by force or act of
God, and seeing what they do. It is
well thought-out; the cellar is the base-
ment of a bombed London mansion,
used by a street-musician, a prostitute,
a girl who draws for street-artists, a
young ex-airman who can’t find himself,
etc.; and to it come, on a farewell visit
as the house is about to be wrecked, the
lord who owns it, his abandoned
mother, his starchy sister and her debu-
tante daughter; the people on stage
would be good to look at, but they don’t
do anything unusual.
The last play, the honorably-men-
tioned “Four Men,” by Andre Davis,
has a startling-enough subject: the four
political young men decide to shoot the
Prime Minister, and in a scene of sus-
pense that should go well on stage,
they do so. But whether British author-
ities would consider this a valuable por-
trayal of contemporary life is another
matter. Finally, one must confess to
finding Miss Jellicoe’s “Sport of My
Mad Mother” unreadable. It might
come alive when spoken, but, as in
“Tinkle” and parts of “Four Men,” the
dialogue isn’t quite convincing—Miss
Jellicoe’s Teddy-boys are drawing-room
Teddy-boys.
Scr that, all-in-all, the Australian
reader of this book may be reinforced
in his good opinion of Beynon,
whose “Shifting Heart” has not only
been played, but has also held the Aus-
tralian stage while these other plays
have had little or no success. More-
over. Kenneth Tynan has hopes for
Australia:—
The recent growth of the narrative
arts in this restless new country has
been something to marvel at: a rich
well is already spurting and may at
any moment gush. One swallow
doesn’t make a summer and one
“Summer of the Seventeenth Doll”
doesn’t make a golden age: all the
same, the omens are joyfully good
.... I would not be surprised if in
the next few years, Australia were
to produce an indigenous O’Neill or
Tennessee Williams.
He means well, of course, but, on the
showing of this book, would it not
be better to hope for another Lawler,
and not a Williams, and another Bey-
non, and not a Miller —and rather than
another Lawler or Beynon, another
Australian no one has ever heard
of? If we expect masterpieces to sur-
prise us, we must hope for what has
never been done before, and we must
be resigned to not knowing what we
want.*
R. McC.
Adelaide Anthology
South Australia, which in recent
years has given to the world the Angry
Penguins, the Jindyworobaks and a
sort of one-man movement led by
Flexmore Hudson, and which now has
its own magazine, “Australian Letters,”
and its own anthology, Verse in Aus-
tralia, 1958, is clearly the centre of
some simmering disturbance of litera-
ture which may one day burst like a
bomb.
It does not appear, however, from
“Verse in Australia” that that day has
yet arrived.
The statement prefacing the new
anthology that at the end of each year
we have “no clear picture of what the
year’s poetry has been” is not true.
That picture has been presented for
many years by Angus and Robertson’s
anthology, “Australian Poetry,” and
lately has been reinforced, with some
overlapping, by the Canberra
anthology, “Australia Writes”—though
this year the Canberra Fellowship has
most interestingly gone to South-east
Asia for its material.
Of course it is always possible to
criticise the selection in “Australian
Poetry”—and the opportunity is seldom
neglected —-but the editor has been

QUEENSLAND'S FIRST
CENTURY
QUEENSLAND on New Year’s Day
enters its centenary year; the
inauguration-date of the colony was
December 10, 1859. On that day Sir
George Ferguson Bowen, fresh from
the government of the lonian Islands,
raised the flag in the Domain—a flag,
incidentally, which was reputed at the
time to have been designed by the now-
unknown Sydney correspondent of the
Brisbane “Courier.” Letters Patent had
formally declared the North to be a
separate colony on the previous June 6.
Centenary celebrations have an
advantage over more remote anni-
versaries in that at the end even of a
hundred years afterwards there are
people alive who have a personal
consciousness of the growth which has
taken place since the originating event.
There are still Queenslanders alive
who knew the first Governor, who died
only in 1899. Many survive to whom
the popular figures of 1859 were boy-
hood acquaintances walking about in
silk-hats and whiskers in the height of
Queensland Februaries. Indeed, though
the real foundation of the colony as a
region of settlement dates properly not
from the convict settlement of 1824 but
from the incursion of the Leslies to
the region of Warwick in 1840, the
second white child born on the
Darling Downs, old Harry Bracker,
died as recently as 1936.
Queensland of 1859 began life
virtually as an unknown quantity, and
the impetus to separation was rather
the nature of its inhabitants than its
apparent resources for managing and
financing its own affairs. The driving-
forces were men who had an instinc-
tive aversion to association with New
South ’Yales, a place still full of
convict emancipists and with a society
well impregnated with them.
The old Etonians and cavalry-
officers who formed the staple of the
North preferred to be alone, even in
a community whose borders, in prac-
tical terms, had only in the previous
decade stretched out 150 miles inland
from the' port and whose financial
resources, as counted in a famous dis-
patch of the Governor, amounted to a
whole in the Treasury.
It began life at the time of the issue
of the separation Patent with a popu-
lation of under 27,000. and by the time
its Parliament —15 Legislative Coun-
cillors and 26 in the Assembly—began
to function in the winter of 1860 it had
reached 30,000.
TT is symptomatic of its then pristine
state that the Australasian Pioneers’
Club recently decided to alter the
qualifying-date for Queensland mem-
bership from 1849 on the ground that
north of the Mary River at that time
there were no pioneers except the
aborigines. It was advanced to 1860,
the year before Burke and Wills were
able to lose themselves in the west and
five years before the Jardine party drove
the first mob of cattle to Cape York—
its last survivor, Charles Scrutton, died
at Borroloola in 1928.
The State north of ’2B was endowed
with an area of land more than twice
the size of New South Wales, and with
a diversity of climate and resources
stretching from well below the sub-
tropics to within 10 degrees of the
Equator. In 1859 it was almost bare
of development save in one small
corner covering about 25,000 square-
miles.
Its history as a gold State began
with the discovery of Canoona field in
the year before its foundation and grew
to world renown and immensity with
the successive discoveries of Charters
Towers in 1872 and the Palmer, Mt.
Morgan (the greatest and most endur-
ing gold-deposit in history) in 1882,
and the discovery of all the great
mineral fields of the Gulf country in a
chain which stretched in time down
to the end of the first decade of the
20th century with Georgetown and the
Etheridge.
Queensland was still having
alluvial gold-rushes in 1903, when
the Dee River began to yield its nuggets
near Mt. Morgan, a few years before
the era of copper set in. to die and suffer
revival in a new age when the name of
Mt. Isa was stuck on the barren ranges
west of Cloncurry as notice to the
world of the existence there of a huge
chain of mineralised hills of silver-
lead (and copper) and probably the
richest of their kind in the world
today, save perhaps for some regions
in northern Canada. Mary Kathleen
ushered in the uranium age in the
same area after World War 11.
The coastal shipping followed the
gold (and later the sugar) along the
coasts of Queensland through the
unique scenery of the Barrier Reef as
the goldseekers had gone with the first
pastoral intrusions into western
Queensland in the early 1850’s.
The pastoralists had discovered,
quite early, a new kind of gold —or
rather two kinds—the golden Mitchell-
grass of the western plains and the
golden artesian-water which is a
characteristic feature of most of the
great Queensland pastoral areas.
In its century of corporate existence,
Queensland has proved itself to have
everything a self-contained nation
could need except oil —pastoral land;
minerals from gold and uranium to
lead, copper and bauxite; sugar-lands;
the largest area of dairying-land in the
Commonwealth; fruit-lands at Stan-
thorpe and along the north coast;
peanuts at Kingaroy; timber; great
natural ports disposed at convenient
intervals along the coast. Every one
of these ports except Brisbane has been
wholly developed within the century
and associated with the names of great
colonisers and great enterprises such
as Colonial Sugar and Burns Philp
and the coastal shipping companies, to
whose competitive spirit the Far North
in particular has been so much
indebted. Qantas, Australia’s pioneer
air-service which now circles the globe,
was born in pastoral Longreach.
Though half of the area of the State
is within the tropics, it is free of most
of the pests which affect other tropical
countries, a fact which has contributed
largely to its development.
Queensland’s modified system of
Government enterprise, which has
grown side-by-side with vigorous
private enterprise, has helped to push
it ahead at a rapid rate almost without
parallel in the history of the British
Commonwealth. There is no doubt
about the great debt which Queens-
landers owe to the vigor with which the
early Governments, particularly that of
Sir-Thomas Mcllwraith, and the canny
Scots after him —in particular Philp.
Kidston and Forgan Smith —pushed
railway arid port programmes to com-
pletion.
The greatest landowner in the world
outside the Communist countries, 84
per cent, of it still vested in the Crown,
Queensland has managed to develop
private enterprise in the pastoral and
agricultural industries with a proper
spread of settlement.
True, at one stage its land laws
seemed to be in an inextricable muddle,
but the orderly mind of W. L. Payne,
now head of the Land Court, untangled
the knots a'nd produced a system which
has attracted admiration even from
overseas. Payne was recently selected
as chairman of the committee which
sorted-out the maze of complication of
land laws in Malaya and produced a
uniform and orderly system there.

A MATERIAL QUESTION.
“That’s a nice bit of stuff, lad. Wool or synthetic?”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Exchange Labyrinth
Like the curate’s egg, the changed policy
on convertibility of European currencies
is good in parts, though luckily the good
parts appear to be bigger than the bad.
Two separate factors are plain in the
announcement of the changes which
affect practically the whole of Western
Europe which trades on any scale
abroad. One is the measure of converti-
bility itself, which makes sterling and
other currencies freely translatable and
transferable throughout the world out-
side the sterling area, where it is still
subject to exchange-control and regula-
tion of capital-transfers by the British
Treasury. Residents of sterling countries
will find little change in their position
except in regard to external trade.
The changes affect the nine nations
involved in the European Payments
Union —Britain, France, West Germany,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, Italy,
Sweden, Norway and Denmark, while
Switzerland has merged its convertible
and European Payments currencies.
The change in the system involves the
creation of a much more flexible system
in most of the nations concerned, and
removes some restrictions on the usability
and attractiveness of sterling as a. world
currency, though the official handcuffs on
it have not been removed, but only
loosened.
The alterations will in a general sense
tend to loosen-up world trade, but
whether to the advantage of producers
of raw materials is another matter. The
laws of supply and demand will operate
to a greater extent than before, and
convertibility to dollars is likely to
throw some advantage in the export busi-
ness to the dollar countries (where their
costs and prices are lower), and to
France, whose moves to devalue the
franc by 17.55 per cent, to a parity of
1382.39 to the £ sterling is the second
outstanding feature of the development.
There is some criticism of the British
leaning towards Continental trade. In
Australia there is natural rejoicing in
some quarters at the new accessibility of
the dollar, but the devaluation of the
franc in a country which is a large
wool-buyer is unwelcome.
The whole matter is so complex that
any hurried judgment on its effects
overall is premature at this stage, but
the balance in advantage seems to be
against Australia rather than otherwise.
The changes indeed, as Mr. McEwen,
Minister for Trade, declared, seem to
give room for “sobering thought.” They
will not add to our ability to import,
and they tend towards producing lower
world markets for our export products.
It will be now easier for foreign
countries selling for sterling to buy dollar
goods, whereas previously they were com-
pelled, in many cases, to buy from
sterling countries, including the U.K. and
Australia. The inconvertibility of sterl-
ing has for a long time tended to boost
sales of sterling goods even where they
were not fully competitive with goods
from hard-currency countries.
Ezra: B.C. and A.D.
In the year 458 b.c., one Ezra, whose
name means “Helper” in the Hebrew,
set-out from Babylonish captivity to lead
the exiled tribes of Israel to a new
prosperity.
He was enabled to set-out, according
to the legend, through “the efforts of a
patriotic old Jewess” (who, no doubt,
was affectionately known to her times
as “Granny”) in the seventh year of the
reign of Ataxerxes, a king who treated
him with generosity, loading him down
with gold and silver and furnishing him
with bullocks and other wealth to aid
him in his task of persuading the
scattered tribes of Israel to build a new
Jerusalem, that great city, and its temple,
these never having been the same since
the death of his revered ancestor at the
hands of the assassins of Nebuchadnezzar.
It is a somewhat confused story. The
tribes of Israel were apparently not con-
sulted either as to the receipt of the
talents of gold and golden basins and
whatnots from Ataxerxes or as to the
plans in general, and they showed a
marked coolness towards the enterprise
when presented with something like a
fait accompli, and great reluctance to
become shareholders, even though Ezra
the promoter and stakeholder was “a
ready scribe in the law of Moses.”
The mystery seems in 1958 to have
repeated itself with another Ezra, who
NEW YEAR
OUTLOOK—page 20.
has suddenly been loaded with gold and
jewels and the wherewithal presented to
build a new temple of learning and
religion by a pious king named Fairfax
—not Atax —and hailing from Broadway
—not Bablyom
The circumstances, however, seem to
be just as confused in a.d. 1958 as they
were in their earlier enactment in 458 b.c.
Why Atax should have handed over the
wherewithal to build-up a rival and
troublesome kingdom and religion,
which his forefathers had but lately
subdued is just as much a mystery as
why Fairfax has apparently doled-out
hundreds of thousands in order to build-
up and maintain a rival in the produc-
tion of pious scrolls and holy prophecies.
Perhaps the reason is to be found, now
as it was recorded of old in the concord-
ance, that the two parties to the arrange-
ment were moved to action by the fact
that “the morals of the people, in con-
sequence of their mixed marriages with,
the Heathen [or Packerites] were rapidly
declining” and needed the strong in-
fluence of a sound set of reformed even-
ing and Sunday papers with pictures of
stained-glass windows on their front
pages round Christmastide to serve-up
the local scandal in more virtuous form.
At any rate, the enterprise is now well
under way. Fairfax says he is no more
in control of what is happening than
Atax was in Babylon when Ezra (who
was not surnamed Norton) went forth
on his mission. Whatever is done for
the benefit of the lost tribes of share-
holders in the modern scheme is to be
controlled independently of all Fairfax
interests. As in the case of the Babylonish
expedition, they were not consulted be-
fore things got under way and shekels
and talents were doled-out to Ezra. And
they are not even to be told for the
moment what terms and conditions are
tagged-on to the scheme for the sale of
shares in Truth and Sportsman, Ltd.,
Sydney, by Ezra 11.
They are simply to accompany Ezra
on his venture of- self-liquidation with
the assurance that the directors are
headed by an accountant formerly asso-
ciated with the Fairfax interests and with
a group of directors not one of whom
could be called a “ready scribe.”
In the circumstances, some of them
are probably uttering very feelingly
the old Ezra’s favorite prayers, such as
“God be merciful to us sinners.”
As for the public of Sydney in par-
ticular, it cannot, care less what happens
to Sydney daily and Sunday journalism.
Nothing could be worse than the present
set-up, so it has nothing to fear.
Mitchell Region Boundaries
The radiant looks seen last week on
the faces of a large proportion of the
residents of the Central West of New
South Wales could not all be ascribed
to the. Christmas spirit; nor to prospects
of a good season next year. In the Shires
of Canobolas, Turon and Abercrombie
the cheerfulness was undoubtedly the
result of an announcement made by
Local Government Minister Renshaw.
It is not often that this Minister’s state-
ments have this happy effect. In the
shires he is regarded more as the voice
of doom than as the bearer of glad
tidings, and most of his utterances of
the past eight months in relation to
Mitchell Region boundaries have seemed
to justify the former view.
The proposals for redrawing the local-
government boundaries of the Mitchell
Region generally referred to in the
Central West as “The Renshaw Plan”—
involved seven shires and three muni-
cipalities. It was proposed that the City
of Orange should absorb Canobolas
Shire ; that the City of Bathurst should
absorb about half the area of Turon and
Abercrombie Shires; that the City of
Lithgow should absorb most of Blaxland
Shire. What remained of Turon and
Abercrombie would be merged to form
a new shire, and what was left of Blaxland
would be split-up between this shire and
Oberon and Rylstone Shires.
The shires most affected by these pro-
posed changes fought bitterly against
the plan ; details of their fight have been
recorded in The Bulletin during the
year. The final round began three months
ago when H. W. Dane of the Local


Government Department held an ex-
haustive inquiry in Bathurst which
lasted over a.month and at which 130
witnesses were heard.
It was Mr. Dane's report that occa-
sioned the Minister’s statement last week.
The commissioner recommended:
(1) No change in the boundaries of
Canobolas Shire and the City of
Orange.
(2) No change in the boundaries of
Turon and Abercrombie Shires and
the City of Bathurst.
(3) A redivision of the City of Lithgow
and the Shires of Blaxland, Oberon,
Rylstone and Turon to create a new
municipality and three new shires.
Announcing this, Mr. Renshaw said
he would now make no changes in
Mitchell Region boundaries. No action
would be taken on the Lithgow proposals
until the councils concerned had been
given an opportunity of considering
them.
The citizens of the Central West have
shown that the only way to preserve
threatened rights is to fight for them.
If Canobolas and Turon had accepted
the Renshaw Plan as inevitable they
would have gone out of existence. Their
success should be an inspiration to other
shires marked for the amalgamation axe.
Reds* Economic Drive
[From “Stromlo”]
In the inner councils of Seato and in
a number of Western and Asian capitals
there is increasing concern at the extent
and methods of the Soviet economic aid
being offered to uncommitted Asian
countries, especially in the south-east of
the continent. Such an attempt to secure
an economic stranglehold in the area is
regarded with much greater alarm than
the possibility, not very acute, of direct
and armed aggression—although the
story is not discounted that Red China
is doing its best to incite Russia, Europe
and the United States into an atomic
holocaust out of which none would sur-
vive, leaving China as master of the
world.
American concern at the Russian eco-
nomic offensive is not confined to the
Government and the State Department.
As in other matters of world concern,
the trade-union movement is giving a
lead in constructive thought a lead
which unhappily is not followed by many
Australian unions or their leaders. The
president of the A.F.L.-C.1.0., George
Meany, in a recent address, stressed that
Russia attached “ropes, not strings,” to
its economic credit arrangements —
usually provisions that redemption of
loans should be in products of the
recipient country. This, he warned, led
to Soviet domination of the recipient
country’s foreign trade, as shown in the
cotton-for-arms deals with Egypt.
Meany made some useful suggestions
which could be considered in Australia.
He said that American business could
help the country and the entire free
world by demonstrating how much free
enterprise could offer and perform as
against the glowing promises of Moscow.
For example, some U.S. firms overseas
had done well in building schools, hospi-
tals and playgrounds and in providing
scholarships. He remarked that water
was the most urgent need and pressing
problem confronting a number of Asian
and African nations, and that the U.S.
led the world in the technique and ex-
perience of water developments. The U.S.
Government, therefore, should help to
finance and build great water .projects
in the Middle East, where the problems
of supply, irrigation and power-shortage
were especially acute.
He made an even more important sug-
gestion, which may well provoke signi-
ficant reactions in Washington. To meet
the Soviet economic challenge, he said,
the U.S. should take the initiative in
organising a “free-world prosperity con-
ference.” This gathering should devise
measures* for stabilising prices of the
basic commodities and raw materials,
reducing trade-barriers between the free
nations, raising living-standards, in-
creasing their productivity and
purchasing-power, and establishing a
substantial international consumers’
credit fund for facilitating the buying of
goods by the peoples of South-east Asia,
the Middle East, Africa and Latin
America.
These were useful proposals, coming
from a man with a genuine responsibility
and in a position of great political and
industrial authority. They should do
much to counter the representations of
the U.S. farm bloc and similar pressure-
groups', and they may help to crystallise
world opinion in the face of a threat
which menaces Australia more, perhaps,
than any other Western natiqp.
Communism in 1959
Whatever success the Communist party
may be having with its industrial and
scientific programmes in Russia, the
world outlook for the movement seems
to have changed significantly in the last
few months.
The signs of it in the U.S.S.R. have
become clearer. Anybody knowing
Khrushchev’s record would be unlikely
to look on him as a man who would
stop at shooting a few former friends
in the back of the head ; but over the
past two years his actions with those
who disagree with him has been in
marked contrast to his treatment of
Beria. The Opposition merely goes to
a job in Siberia, if it is due for liquida-
tion and too weak in popularity to count
very much.
Almost immediately after Bulganin's
disappearance and that of others, reports
became rife in Europe of wholesale dis-
turbances in Russia. Then he was
brought back after a considerable inter-
val to “confess” and be exhibited alive to
reassure his supporters. At about the
time he “confessed” Serov, the Chief of
the Interior Department and the MVD,
the official responsible for public order,
was removed from office. The obvious
implication was that he had not been
doing his job. He was replaced by an
almost unknown junior henchman of
Khrushchev, a “youth - movement
leader,” one who could be taken to
know thoroughly the student and uni-
versity trends. This move lent some color
to the rumors that most of the distur-
bances and unrest during the past few
months had been among youth and
student bodies.
Almost instantaneously following his
appointment, a new Khrushchev plan for
dealing with youth was announced a
plan for combining work and schooling
over an eight-year period. It is a cunning
scheme which, in effect, amounts to a
more intensified conscription and control
of youth, placing the Government in a
position at any moment to move large
bodies of students who show signs of
unrest.
In the Iron Curtain countries there
has been trouble ever since the Hungarian
massacres, with consequent liquidations
and changes of personnel at high levels
in Rumania, Bulgaria and Poland. The
mysterious withdrawals, or announced
withdrawals, of troops from East Ger-
many was linked to the scheme to give
the Communist leaders there the right
to govern, and East Germany “nation-
hood” with Berlin for a bonus and a
promise of military backing to keep it
which may or may not be enforceable.
It all sounds strangely like a device to
bluff a weak hand. Nato’s firm stand
in the face of the most gruesome threats
has not helped Khrushchev.
In Western Europe, the gradual
failure of the Communists in country
after country has had its finale in France,
the home of revolution, where there has
indeed been a “revolution.”
The Communists who 10 years ago
were confident that by this time France
would have a Parliament like that of
Moscow, with a 100 per cent. Communist-
approved membership, are a mere
splinter-party. All the trend is towards
British-style democracy. The great eco-
nomic crash in the United States which
the Kremlin has promised its followers
has failed to materialise.
In China, Mao had moved to consoli-
date the conscription of labor through-
out the country in preparation for the
next and final moves towards overwhelm-
ing southern Asia. He has apparently
failed to such an extent that he himself
is fading out of the Government control.
Round Asia and the Middle East,
Moscow seems to be having further diffi-
culties. The Far East has the spectacle
of Japan resurgent under a democratised
regime. The canny Indonesian Soekarno
has decided that his bread is buttered
on the Western side—for the time being
anyhow. In Pakistan, Communist rot
was suddenly stopped. In Iraq the plan
to take-over the blood-soaked regime of
Kassem is not going as well as it might.
Even Nasser, faced at the Cairo Afro-
Asian Conference with a unanimous
resentment against Russian infiltration,
has begun to double-cross his former
Allies. The Persians have been snapping
their fingers at Russian threats.
The year 1959 could be a poor year
for Communism, if the Western Allies
play the right cards.

“I Want the moon!”
garbage blokes got in early this
year with their poetical appeal coyly
slipped under the lid, which for the first
time, in six months I didn’t have to dredge
out of the gutter. They thus wooed the
Muse:
Our humble job’s to get rid of
The garbage you’re not wanting.
We toil the year round, wet or shine,
For us no cheers or bunting.
We give this service with a smile
Though sometimes it’s unpleasant.
So here’s to the Christmas spirit with
Its giving of a present.
Well, it seemed an inspiration as well
as a challenge to smite the lyre in turn,
so I obliged, and tied it to the lid next
time up:
I recall one bleak morn.
It was just after dawn
When I rushed out. The can I’d forgotten.
I was desperate, for
It contained at its core
Some fish that was horribly rotten.
As I staggered at last
To the gate, you shot past
And grinned. No hard feelings. A bottle
You’ll find for your cheer.
It’s not whisky or beer
But some on your throttle!

1912 at London’s Albert Hall (seating
capacity 10,000) is always booked - out
many weeks before it is held. They have
a custom of introducing newly-composed
carols, some specially written for the
festival. The instant popularity of
“Christmas Bells,” by Sir Frederick
Bridge, and “Three Kings,” with its pre-
lude of Bow Bells, by Sir Frederick
Cowen, justifies the suggestion that a
competition be announced early in the
new year for carols written, and the
music composed, here in Australia.
“Sandra”: Neighbor sent in 10-year-
old Jane to borrow scissors. “Which

couragement from a teacher who, beat-

“But, butt, billygoat.” Still, there are
some blues in They’re a Weird Mob,

them. The implement held by one of
the visitors is obviously a crook. Inci-
dentally, to answer “Dorian” (B.
3/12/’5B) as well: the actual number
of Magi—to give them their proper title
—is not given by Saint Matthew. One
tradition says that there were 12 ; later
the number was reduced to three, mainly
because of the three gifts. The relics of


the three Magi are said to be preserved
in Cologne Cathedral. There is another
query: Why are they associated with
Christmas when the Western Church
celebrates the visit on the 13th day after
Christmas, which also happens to be
the day after all decorations should be
taken down?

Broken Hill Pty. has followed suit, and
this year the miners at two pits—Lambton

The practice of accepting such gifts was
condemned by Western District Reds in

DOUBTFUL RULE
“Every romance has its crises, but these can

When you’re strolling round the shops
With a girl ( boring for you,
But she apparently finds it highly
pleasing ),
And in front of one she stops,
Some engagement-rings to view,
And you realise your arm she’s gently
squeezing —
Here you must think very fast.
To make positive that he,
The jeweller, with you will do no
business,
Stagger on. When danger’s past
Then explain the allergy :
That sight of diamonds always gives
you dizziness.
By your Daphne you’ve been led,
Like a goat, to meet her folk.
Her Ma is an amorphous 15-stoner.
You look 20 years ahead
And a vision you invoke
Of an o.s. strife of whom you’d be
the owner.
How to extricate yourself
Is the quiz. Don’t hear that gong!
The answer’s easy to the shrewd
contriver.
Giving a hint that you and pelf
As partners never last long,
Sting her old man on the quiet for
a fiver.
He who feels he’s safe while he
Has lots of ’em on a string
And is confident that switching he
can fix up,
Finds such changeability
Gives life vivid coloring —
Until one day when date-times he
will mix-up.
Clever tactics, you would say,
He must use when, lobbing there
At the rendezvous, he sights three
gals together?
Brother, if he’d save the day
(And himself) from fury rare
He’ll forget these, and just beat it,
hell-for-leatlier.

Ghosts in
Memory’s Bar
By ERIC BEDFORD
As one’s shanks and hair
thin, biceps and ego
deflate, belly and dental-
plate increase in size,
and leg-stride and life-expec-
tation shorten, one draws more
and more upon the memory-
box to listen to the echo of
the laughter of former years.
Life, the disciplinarian of us
all, says that there shall be
more cakes and ale, but not
so hot i’ the mouth, and, if
you desire to retaste those
which have been eaten and
drunk without an inglorious
aftermath, they shall be con-
sumed at the Bar of Memory.
The Bar of Memory has its
advantages. In a flash you may
people it with the most in-
teresting, amusing, unortho-
dox, gregarious egotists of a
half - century’s bar - thumping.
And, as the dead are always
much more alive in Memory’s
Bar than the living, they catch
the barmaid’s eye, and spectral
figures throw visionary coins
of the realm into an endless
line of cash-registers, which
tinkle and chatter as they
masticate with avaricious
hunger.
The spectres of the past
overcrowd the bar, pushing the
living into the reality of the
street. The bar - doors are
closed, and Adam McCay,
Lennie Lower, Mick Paul,
Percy Lindsay, Eric Hanman,
and many another artist,
writer or odd bar character,
buys the drinks and im-
patiently waits his turn to
explain, by way of anecdote,
his reason for the joy in living
or to lift the lid off his Id.
An unusual spectre is Lennie
Lower, because his Id was
almost spectral when living.
An underlying devil in his
whimsy, playing-up to his own
oddness, enjoying his lack of
financial status by bewildering
friend and foe alike with
financial jiggery - pokery 'of
“money against documents,”
“credit-squeezes” on the “five-
bob to a quid” level. His
puckish and continuous
laughter at King Midas even-
tually threw away his key of
the safe.
About the time when his
Here’s Luck was published
Lennie told of when he went
fishing with a quaint-character
journalist:
“We walked about a thou-
sand bloody miles over a
million bloody gibbers to get
to the spot where he said the
fish come up and ask you what
kind of fish d’you want, and
how big. An’ you know how
I like exercise if it’s below the
elbow! Anyway, we were to
have that later, as I had four
bottles of bait in a sugar-bag,
and he had all the rest of the
doings in another bag. I don’t
know how I came to be going
along with him, but I smelt
the rat had been wished on
me by my wife for having
made the welkin ring by drop-
ping a bottle of lemonade
down the lift-well. It sounded
like a politician with his fingers
caught in the public cash-
register, and we’d been told
to move. Anyway, there we
were making corns across the
gibbers. When we got to the
sea my enemy sat down and
stared at the seascape. Well,
I drew a cork or two out of
the bait. Then I asked him
what sort of fish we would
catch there, and do you know
what the louse said? ‘We don't
fish here. I bought the fish in
town. We cook it here. I
always come here for the view.’
An’ the hyphenated sea-wife
of a seaman took a griller out
of his knapsack!”
T ennie also told of the time
when with “Long Hugh”
they discovered they had spent
all their money with the excep-
tion of a tram-fare to Bondi,
which Lennie hung on to with
a leg-weary determination to
be saved further miles of flat-
footing it over a soakless
desert of macadam. “Long
Hugh’s” greatest insult was to
call a man “Insect!”
Lennie told the story later :
“I watched him until his
head was turned away and a
Bondi tram was coming. I
swung onto the tram as it
crossed King Street. We didn’t
have two fares, and, after all,
he only lived a mile away, and
he had longer legs. 1 got home,
and into my cot, and was
dreaming about Jack and a
Beer Stalk about two hours
later, when I was awakened
by a thumping on the door of
our flat. Thinking it might
be somebody who had come
to tell me that I’d won the
lottery, or been knighted, or
the office accountant had been
caught red - handed putting
five-bob on to my expense-
account, 1 went to the door
and there was Long Hugh,
with his ears sticking up in
i age, like a frilled-lizard, after
his five-mile walk to see me.
‘lnsect!’ he shouted. ‘lnsect!’
And he turned on his heel and
walked all the way back to
town!”
A nother ghost in the Bar
of Memory with Lennie
Lower is Adam McCay, his
deeply - lined, Savaronola - like
face opening and shutting at
a continually increasing speed
with the alcoholic intake.
A highly skilled and in-
dustrious journalist, he had
edited a number of Sydney
dailies and had “discovered”
Lennie on the “Labor Daily”
and taken him to the “Daily
Guardian.” Some years pre-
viously he had edited the
Sydney “Sunday Times” in the
days of Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
ownership.
Adam was a highly - strung
journalistic racehorse, and
sometimes, when he had
“owner trouble,” he would
embrace Bacchus with en-
thusiasm, and forget all about
newspapers as he looked over
his pointed nose at the brim-
ming cup.
One Saturday Mclntosh did
not find Adam McCay at
his editor’s desk, because
Adam, emotionally upset by
Mclntosh the previous day,
had looked for happiness in
the* cup, gone aboard an inter-
state steamer, and, forgetting
that there was a copy-deadline,
and that Sunday papers
usually appear on Sundays,
was well on his way to Mel-
bourne.
The ship’s captain radioed
Mclntosh that he had a spare
editor aboard. The newspaper-
owner sent a man to Mel-
bourne to meet the ship and
bring Adam back to Sydney,
but Adam was so high on the
alcoholic wave of optimism
that he convinced Mclntosh’s
plenipotentiary that the
scenery in Melbourne bars was
preferable to the Taj Mahal
by moonlight, and there were,
then, two missing journalists.
A third was dispatched, and,
eventually, the trio turned-up
at the “Sunday Times” office.
Mclntosh went into one of
his many bad-language bouts,
and only stopped to ask, in
the manner of an owner to
his horse:
“Why did you do it,
McCay?”
“Well,” said Adam, with
that little, clipped, malicious
inflexion which he would put
in his voice when angry:
“Well, you gave me a shiny,

POLITICAL POINTS
External Affairs Minister Casey has
“stressed” that the Russian base Mirny,
in Australia’s Antarctic territory, is “sup-
posed to be only temporary.” But what’s
the Russian word for “temporary”?
• •
The N.S.W. Government rejects as
impracticable Sydney engineer D. R.
Carter’s plan for building prefabricated
tunnels under Sydney Harbor by towing
concrete sections into position and sink-
ing them. Yet at the present time the
Maritime Services Board is having large
concrete caissons constructed at Rozelle,
towed into position at the western side
of Circular Quay and sunk there. A
new wharf will be built on top of them.
Not exactly the same as Carter’s tunnel,
but not exactly unlike it, either.
• •
According to the Institute of Public
Affairs, Victoria, the moods of Mel-
bourne and Sydney differ markedly about
immediate economic prospects, possibly
due to the gloomy outlook of the Sydney
press and the cheerful attitude of the
Melbourne dailies to the nation’s ability,
with a basically sound economy, to take
any setback in its stride. Newspapers in
the other States, especially in Brisbane
and Perth, take the Sydney—er—grand-
motherly view.

In Darwin Supreme Court just before
Christmas Judge Kriewaldt rejected
Albert Namatjira’s appeal against his
conviction for supplying liquor to a
native ward, but reduced the six months’
sentence to three months. His 36-page
judgment rejected every point of the
appeal except the argument that the
penalty was too harsh. Giving his own
view of Namatjira’s position, the judge
said:
In some respect his outlook on life is
similar to that of white persons, while in
other aspects his aboriginal inheritances
predominate. I should regard the fact that
Namatjira has not entirely adopted the
mode of life and outlook of white persons
as an extenuating circumstance.
Minister for Territories Paul Hasluck
later announced that the aboriginal artist
would serve his sentence “in the open
air at a settlement in his own country.”

missioner having been authorised to sus-

vehicles —has set his sights on pedes-
trians. He has announced that he will
seek a law prohibiting the crossing of
streets except at intersections or marked
pedestrian-crossings. Why not go the
whole hog and build pedestrian-proof
fences along all footpaths, with auto-
matic gates at approved crossings?

The Queensland Government has com-
missioned a British firm, Merz and

CUPBOARD INSPECTION


In electricity and irrigation, which
are comparatively new enterprises, and
in road-extension Queensland is still
pioneering, but advancing with
rapidity, having regard to its popula-
tion and the tremendous scope of its
territory, of which the resources are
only just beginning to be tapped.
YX/ITH its population multiplied
forty-fold since its inauguration,
however, it still suffers from the afflic-
tion which besets other States, though
in greater degree—the tendency of its
population to huddle together in one
corner in a capital which holds nearly
half its total population and is 1500
miles by airline from its furthest point.
Brisbane has grown more than
fivefold since Federation, and at a rate
which has made it impossible for
modern facilities of sanitation and
water-supply to keep pace with it.
This unbalance in the distribution
of population is partly due to the
inability of the pioneers to provide
reasonable living-conditions for women
and children in large areas of the
North, in the most remote parts of
which the danger of native attack still
persisted into the 20th century.
"PROTOTYPE towns like Mt. Isa and
Mary Kathleen, however, have
shown that these disabilities need no
longer exist, and that it is possible for
major enterprises to create in the most
remote parts of the State family living-
conditions which are not merely equal
but superior to those of the capital.
Radio and air-travel, the Flying
Doctor service and prosperity have
killed loneliness and distance for most
Queenslanders; the kerosene refrigera-
tor and small-unit oil- and electrical-
power its greatest outback discomforts.
With the development of the mineral
areas of the North, the exploitation
of the coal of Central Queensland and
the extension northwards and west-
wards of irrigation, which is already
turning districts looked on as eternally
pastoral to agriculture of a type which
can be linked to beef-raising, Queens-
land begins its second century on the
eve of growth as vast as that of its first.
Whether it will finish the new cen-
tury in one piece remains to be seen.
But certainly it is the coming region
of Australia, one into which the balance
of Australian population- and industry-
density might easily shift within a
couple-of-hundred years; one which
is the more interesting since half of it
is a great experimental station in which
the white race is proving that it can
live and prosper in the tropics in
climatic conditions which have hitherto
been looked on as out of the range of
large-scale permanent habitation by
European races.
This is as well for Australia. The
more the accent of development is on
the North, the better for the country
as a whole. For northern Queensland
and New Guinea are the doorsteps of
invasion, the first footholds which an
overseas attacker would try to secure;
the frontiers of defence.
The North is, therefore, a matter for
preferential consideration by the
Federal Government, the area in which
the greatest emphasis of national
developmental elfort should be con-
centrated.

will explore the coast of Enderby Land
before returning to Australia by way of

the coast of Oates Land and return to

Commenting on the growth of the Aus-
tralian motor industry in the past decade
Minister for Trade McEwen said the
industry represented an investment of
more than £lOO million and was still
growing. Manufacture of vehicles and
parts gave direct employment to 50,000
people; repairs and maintenance to
50,000 more. The requirements of the
local market were about 233,000 vehicles
a year; the industry was capable of
meeting this and also of developing ex-
ports, which in recent years averaged
£6 million.
One item of statistics McEwen didn’t
quote is supplied by the Australian
Automobile Association’s newsletter:
sales-tax on motor-vehicles and parts
yielded the Federal Treasury
last financial year.

“Wusslean”: Melbourne’s Pentridge

telephoned the police and obligingly
waited in the phone-booth for an escort

Waddy has passed on in England. A house-
master at The King’s School,' Parramatta,
and later at Rugby for many years, he was a
first-class cricketer, and batsman in particular.
His practice at school was unorthodox —he used
to put-up four stumps at the practice-nets with
a shilling on the two middle pegs and ask all
and sundry to throw at him. This gave'him
some really fast stuff to cope with. In later

ABORIGINALITIES
My nomination for Australia’s longest
party-line is the one that starts from
Norseman (W.A.) exchange to Balladonia
petrol-station and homestead half-a-mile
away, to Cocklebiddy, Madura Motel,
Eucla homestead and weather-station,
Koonalda station, Nullarbor station and
finishes at Colona homestead —a total
distance of 676 miles of single-wire line.
I lately asked Mr. Jackson, the Balla-
donia petrol-station proprietor, to get
in touch with Balladonia homestead, half-
a-mile away across the plains, for me.
The following conversation drifted
through the open doorway: “That you
Cocklebiddy? Yes, all well at the service-
station . . . Hullo, Madura, weather good
with you? It’s beautiful heie . . . Good
morning, Eucla, how are you? Must be
fine with you, as you are coming in
strongly . . . Hullo, hullo. Balladonia
homestead ; calling Balladonia . . .”
Sound of receiver being hung-up. He
came outside. “Sorry, my friend, can’t
raise the homestead, but hang-on a bit,
I’ll send the lad over in the utility with
your message.”—“Yen.”

“H.A.L.”: Since the coming of the

glass windows there have been many
cases of birds flying full-tilt into the

ture in the room behind, the glass
becomes an efficient mirror. A bird fly-

piece of country, swerves to investigate
it and hits the glass head-on. The chief
species which are fooled are the intro-
duced lace-neck doves, blackbirds and
thrushes, but an occasional soldier-bird
or wattle-bird also makes the same
calamitous mistake.

“Bogaduck”: Few people know that
the song of the reed - warbler (B.
10/12/’5B) is remarkably like that of
the European nightingale. This was
brought home to me when a friend
played a gramophone - recording of a
nightingale’s song, made in England, and
a tape-recording of a reed-warbler, made
on the Murray near Gunbower (Vic.).
Sent in turn through the amplifier, it was
hard to tell one from the other.

“Reims”: The first real wheat-crop
grown around Southern Cross (W.A.)
nearly 30 years ago astounded the locals
and discredited the experts by returning
about 10 bags to the acre from scratched-
in crops, and the yield so impressed the
Government of the day that a scheme
was prepared to establish 3500 farms
beyond what had been accepted as the
limit of wheat-country. The next couple
of years, when Southern Cross crops
didn’t even return seed, effectively
scotched the scheme, and soon after that
a lot of abandoned 1000-acre farms in
an even better rainfall were re-
allocated into bigger areas more suited
to sheep. But each year some wheat is
sown around the Cross, and in a season
like this, when the whole of the wheat-
belt has a bumper-crop, that area pays
dividends in two ways: it yields good
crops ; and it helps to raise the overall
quality of the wheat. Bumper-crops tend
to be rather lower quality than usual —
or at least rather weaker—-but wheat
grown in the lower-rainfall areas is
harder and stronger than the average.
Last season nothing worth mentioning
came from the Southern Cross district,
so the effect was negligible. The 300,000
bushels they reckon they’ve got this
season is enough to have some effect on
the State’s average quality.

“Macquarie": I learned my shovelling
in the days when concrete was turned
by hand and a gang of two men and a
youth was expected to, and did, mix
and place the concrete foundation of a
10-square cottage in a day ; but I could
have flown easier than shovel with my
left hand lower than the right—and 1
was always right-handed. On the other
hand, my dad, who was just as right-
handed, shovelled in the manner of
“Oliver Filter’s” shift-boss, and was as
definite that I was a mollydooker as 1
was sure he boodled southpaw. Over the
years I’ve found that the number of
blokes shovelling or chopping wood left-
handed, though they are right-handed,
works out about 50-50 —and both camps
reckon the other kackyhanded. My argu-
ment is that a right - handed batsman
holds his right hand low, therefore a
right-handed shoveller should do the
same. And our side has Royal patronage
—a photograph of the Queen planting
a tree showed her right hand down near
the blade.

“Lorna Doone”: The circus came to
town, and fetched-up on the parklands
on the day that an inter-State high-
pressure-sales TV-business opened its
doors. There were prizes and quizzes
galore, and the mob swelled in from the
footpath and stove-in the windows. The
police, even with joined hands, hadn’t
a hope ; then a trooper tried to get his
horse to mount the gutter and approach
the front-door. As he urged it patiently,
but vainly, a hoarse voice said: “Take
’im down to the circus, copper ; they’ll
teach ’im to stand on a box for y’!”

drink in the morning—and “third-mate.”

“Columbia”: Our Queensland town-
ship was called Terror’s Creek until an
unromantic Government changed it to
Dayboro. The original monicker, which
is still attached to the nearby creek,

a stallion named Terah, belonging to
Whiteside Station. It hated the aborigines
and would attack them in their camps
The corruption of the name to Terror
followed.

“Spin”: The bloke of Aria's who
reckoned the insects molesting his garden
could be ladybirds (B. 12/11/ ’5B) was
right; and it could have been the species
shown on his back. This is obviously of
the genus Epilachna and probably the
species 28-punctata, the specific name
stemming from the 24-28 black spots on
its wings. There are nearly 3000 species
of ladybirds, and this one with the many
spots is native to eastern Australia and
the Kimberleys; and, not being car-
nivorous like most of its family, it can
do a lot of damage. It has the advantage
that the average gardener can't tell it
from the beneficial species, which are
protected because they and their larvie
feed on the larvse of harmful insects like
aphids and mites. There are two clues.
If the leaves of your plants are eaten
out, leaving only the vein pattern, you
can suspect Epilachna 28-punctata, and
you can look for its larvae knowing that
you can’t be mistaken in them. They’re
covered with spines and look like ridicu-
lously small hedgehogs.

“Gravelsnatcher”: “Bilwon’s” cham-
pion bag-sewers (B. 3/12/’5B) would
have sounded better to an old hand if
he'd stated the weight of each sewn bag.
The art lies in getting the full weight—
1801b. to a three-bushel bag—in practi-
cally every bag ; and in the pre-bulk-
handling days of W.A. the record-
breaker didn’t last long if the first con-
signment to the siding averaged under
weight. I’ve seen all sorts of dodges
used—a favorite one was a funnel with
a long stem which would reach down
into the corners and from which an
extra pound or two could be tamped-
down as it was withdrawn —but a man
with the true knack could dispense with
them all. It was the way you dumped
the bag that counted. By the same token,
occasionally you’d strike a line of bags
that wouldn’t take the three bushels, and
all you could do as you sweated it out
was curse the Asiatic manufacturer who'd
skimped on the material for the sake of
a few rupees.
“Bass”: As “Bilwon” says, bag-
sewing’s a dying game. So’s axe-clearing,
sucker-bashing, fencing with a shovel,
and all the other jobs that were con-
sidered good piece-work occupations. I
once took-on a contract demolishing ant-
hills at threepence each ; and they were
so thick I made good money for a few
days. A man humping his bluey through
the bush now wouldn’t find much in the
way of contract-work he could handle
with his bare hands. Come to think of it,
short of shearing, how would a man
knock-up a quick cheque in the bush
without a thousand quid’s worth of
equipment?
KINGDOM OF FIFE
In Fifeshire, on a summer’s day,
(With winter not so far away,
As is the wont of Scottish weather.
Which knows no ethics whatsoever )
We found from the brown land and
wide —
A green enchanted countryside.
The old stone houses really wore
Roses in bloom about the door;
And the hedged lanes so narrow grew.
We brushed the briar and dark-leaved
yew.
On to the Firth the roadway led,
With Inverkeithing just ahead,
Our goal—of all prosaic spots —
St. Andrews, with its tees and tots:
(A bracing round, the clink of ice,
And thou, methinks, were Paradise.)
The elms stood high, the fields lay mellow,
Tricked with their daisied white and
yellow,
When suddenly we stared, amazed —
A scarlet sea, the poppies blazed.
Some wight, less farmer than aesthete,
Had 1 left these weeds among his wheat,
To wax, and glow against the sky,
And glut the souls of passers-by.
On this soil kings in court did sit,
And left their bones to nourish it,
Yet naught more royally bestrown
Had this most ancient kingdom known.
Silent, we gazed our joyous fill . . .
Then did I wish, with such a will
That Vincent, of the severed ear,
And Mr. Wordsworth, had been near!
n.s.w.
BEVERY BERRY.


Time Means Tucker
By H. P. (“DUKE”) TRITTON
Illustrations chiefly from contemporary issues of The Bulletin.
Both of. them 19-year-olds, the writer and his mate Dutchy have set out from
Sydney in 1905 on a breezily adventurous wander about the N.S.W. outback,
learning to become shearers, doing fencing contracts and having a go at gold-
digging, singing and taking the hat round in the towns, boxing in show booths,
meeting picturesque characters, and generally getting to know the bush and bush
folk, and taking life as they find it. They have gone by boat to Newcastle, headed
west from there, jumped the rattler. to Narrabri, and, characteristically, have
done their share with other volunteer firefighters in saving that town from being-
burnt down. At Brewarrina Show they have picked-up a pound or two for a
round or two in Ruenalf’s boxing-booth while waiting for shearing to start at
Charlton, and after cut-out are padding it through flood-rains to Calga, 200
miles west.
The water was only a
couple of inches deep
where we stood, and
seeing a patch of dry
ground some distance away we
made for it. I had heard of
the floods in the western rivers,
and always pictured them in
my mind as great walls of
water roaring down and sweep-
ing everything before them. So
this creeping water had me
puzzled, more so when I looked
at the rising sun and clear sky,
which gave promise of a beau-
tiful spring day.
We followed our fence for
about two miles and came to
dry ground again. The water
had not been deeper than 6in.
at any part of this trip. It
was such a large area of dry
ground that we were under the
impression we had crossed the
flood. After another few miles
we came to water again, but we
could see more dry ground
ahead.
The so-called “flat” country
is very deceptive, and after
travelling some hundreds of
miles I had been prepared to
swear that it was dead level,
but in flood-time there is a
surprising amount of high
ground. In the big floods this
is covered, but this flood was
only in the five streams that
meet the Macquarie at the
Mole, sometimes called the
Overflow. The water spreads
here and forms the reed-beds,
a series of swamps covering a
huge area of lignum scrub,
inhabited mainly by wild-pigs,
rabbits and black-snakes.
Our swags and clothes were
wet, so we camped and dried-
out. The water did not seem
to be rising, so we stayed the
night. We had plenty of.
company sheep, rabbits,
kangaroos, emus and a few
pigs. We were in no danger
of going hungry. (I nearly
forgot the snakes.)
Tn the morning we found the
A water had risen about 6in.,
but we had to face it. We had
reached the road, but it was of
no help to us, being merely a
track, and, as the water was
muddy, we soon lost it.
We, continued going from
rise to rise in the direction
where we thought the Mac-
quarie lay. Luck, and a sense
of direction, finally brought us
to the river, right at the cross-
ing.
We were no better off, as
there was no bridge and the
Government boat was on the
other side. Eight men were
camped there, waiting for
someone to cross. They had
been there three days, watch-
ing the river rise, as none of
them could swim.
Too late to try that night,
I swam over the next morning.
The water was warm consider-
ing that it was late August. I
had to swim only about 50yds.,
and there was practically no
current, and, though there was
plenty of driftwood, this was
moving so slowly that I had
no trouble dodging if. I was
cheered as I brought the boat
over, and I didn’t mind it at
all; in fact, I felt quite a hero.
After crossing the Macquarie
we were only eight miles from
Carinda, a village of about
30 houses. We still had to cross
the Marthaguy, but managed to
wade it. After the hardships of
the last few days we needed a
little comfort, so we stayed
at the pub. (There was only
one in Carinda.) A bath and a
good feed made us feel a lot
better.
We went to the bar, where we
found our new friends drink-
ing and telling their stories of
the flood. All were eager to
shout me beer, but my drinking-
form had not improved since
Ravensworth. I sat in a corner
and did a lot of listening,
while nursing a pint of beer.
The sergeant of police came
in for a pot and informed us
the Castlereagh was coming
down, and advised us not to
attempt the trip to Coonamble.
He said we were lucky to come
through from Charlton, as there
had been further heavy falls of
rain at Nyngan, and the rivers
we had crossed were now show-
ing what they could do.
TThe news of the Castlereagh
being in flood was bad. It
meant we had no chance of
reaching Calga in time. While
we had been struggling through
the floods the weather had been
perfect, and not a cloud in the
sky. But next morning the sky
was overcast, and heavy rain
predicted.
We heard of the Shingle Hut,
an old pub recently closed and
now empty at the junction of
the Merri Merri and Martha-
guy. So, having no desire to
stay in Carinda, we loaded-
up with tucker, and made our
way up to it. Half-an-hour
after our arrival “Hughie” must
have decided the rousies
deserved a break, and “sent her
down” all over the State. For
24 hours it pelted down, and
the river came over its banks
till the country looked like a
lake. The Shingle Hut was on
high ground, and we weren’t
worried.
There were seven men beside
Dutchy and myself, and as two
of them were fair singers, and
the others could all tell a good
yarn, time did not drag. One
of them, Jack Bull, had been
shearing since 1880, and his
tales of the shearers’ fights for
wages and conditions were
always worth,hearing. Though
he couldn’t read or write he
had a very dramatic way of
telling a story, keeping us in
suspense, and working up to
the climax, waving his arms,
and shouting at the top of his
voice.
By the end of the third day
the country was dry enough
to travel, so we started off early
next morning, in company with

Business, Robbery, Etc.
THE OUTLOOK FOR 1959
The New Year will open with wool at its lowest level for nearly
10 years, but with the capacity of the Australian economy
physically at its greatest ever, with the outstanding exception of
the transport industry. Costs have steadied, though they are not
completely stable. The fall in farm incomes will have wide
repercussions in business and in the Treasury, and will affect the
volume of overseas goods, services and capital available to the
Australian community. Capital created internally is likely to be
scarcer than we have seen it for many years, unless the demand
for it is temporarily affected by a slackened business tempo. But
so long as costs can be kept stable, Australia has many resources
at its hand suited to the maintenance of a high level of
employment and overall prosperity.
Australia will face the New
Year with its economic
affairs on a more stable foot-
ing than at any time since
1939, its people more united,
but with its basic export indus-
tries having to deal with the
toughest trading conditions of
the past 20 years.
With overseas prices for
wool and metals at their
present low levels the advan-
tage of a comparatively stable
costs-index within the Com-
monwealth is an enormous
advantage and consolation,
and the benefit of the tooling-
up by secondary industry, in
some cases to a point beyond
what was thought to be the
requirements of the country a
couple of years ago, should
become apparent if cuts in
imports are forced on us by
the shrinkage in our export
receipts.
The Slump In Prices
The fall in farm incomes
during the past year has been
very heavy, and most mining
industries and communities
have been hit severely. Except
that the season in 1959 will
start-off better than it did in
1958, the prospects for our
exports are not so good as they
were even as recently as a year
ago, though sugar and meat are
exceptions to the general trend.
It would appear that in the
national-income account farm
incomes will show a further
drop during 1958-59, with a
reduction in the incomes of
many companies and businesses
away from the rural scene.
But the overall picture as
regards company incomes will
be hard to gauge, particularly
as the drop which occurred in
1957-58 was more than
accounted for by the greater
provisions for depreciation.
There will be a redistribu-
tion of fortunes among various
types of companies listed on
the Stock Exchanges. This
redistribution has already been
in process for nearly a year,
being most apparent (on the
adverse side) among the base-
“T ogether?”
metal mines and pastoral com-
panies, but the process may go
several steps further during the
current financial and calendar
years respectively, especially if
import-licensing is resorted to
in order to redress the adverse
balance-of-payments.
Imports
If a high level of internal acti-
vity is maintained by ordinary
demand of a growing popula-
tion or through the effects of
some deficit-finance, then the
trend to import excessively will
be stimulated regardless of the
adequacy or otherwise of our
export income. An expanding
work-force engaged in, say,
housing or public works at a
time of low-export income is
almost certain to attract more
severe import-restrictions.
Clearly, with export prices
at their present levels, the land
industries will not be as pros-
perous as they have been for
the past decade, and less spend-
ing and investment is likely
from this direction.
A reduction in taxation
collections from rural pro-
ducers by the Federal Treasury
is also inevitable.
A tightening of import-
restrictions is indicated (at the
present level of export prices)
in the second or third quota-
periods of 1959.
Increased Capacity
The tooling-up of industry
and the expansion of its capa-
city, particularly over the past
five years, should put this
country in a position to rely
more on its own resources for
a few years in the event of a
serious shrinkage in its trade
with the rest of the world.
But while, in a well-planned
economy, it will be possible to
put into employment in suit-
able public works and on
domestic housing those dis-
employed in vulnerable export
(or associated) industries, the
loss of export income will have
undoubted effects upon the
availability of goods and ser-
vices and private capital.
Supplies Better
Basic industries such as the
coal, steel and cement indus-
tries have a potential capacity
approaching a current surplus
in relation to demand, and it
should be physically- feasible to
go on with national develop-
ment, by public and private
enterprise, where there is any
sign of serious unemployment.
Not for 20 years has the supply
position been so good in these
basic industries, and electric
power is in better supply than
it has been for a generation.
Transport is still a major
weakness throughout the Aus-
tralian economy, and it cannot
be said to have become notice-
ably more efficient. But the
capacity of the railways is
probably greater than, it has
ever been ; at any rate, all rail-
ways are looking for business,
and no longer asking, “Is your
journey really necessary?”
Our total internal physical
resources can be said to be at
their peak.
Conditions in the U.S.A.
It is possible (not to say
probable) that there will be
some recovery in export prices
during 1959. The United States
is looking forward to great
expansion in the 1960’5, and
already business is recovering
from the slump of last year.
Business conditions in the
U.S.A. have profound effect
on world prices for raw
materials, and a recovery in
U.S. industrial activity would
be reflected in our export
income.
Wool appears to be in rather
a special compartment because
of the currently fierce com-
petition from synthetics, and
the very cheapness of wool is
a deterrent to some manufac-
turers because unstable raw-
material costs involve trading
risks, compared with a steady
price for synthetics.
The slump in the U.S.A.
coincided, to some extent, with
the cutting of defence
expenditure in respect of con-
ventional armament and cur-
tailment of Federal civil
expenditure. Britain also cur-
tailed its defence expenditure
about the same time. It is
probable that normal increase
in civil demand will ultimately
take-up the slack caused by the
drop in defence expenditures,
the reaction from which was
accentuated by tight-money
policies in both the U.S. and
Britain.
Prior to its 1958 Budget the
United States was warned that
unless Federal expenditures
were checked they would
“ultimately bring on a depres-
sion that would make your hair
curl.” By now there are fewer
fears of the boom before the
bust.
Overall Outlook
In summary, the outlook for
1959 in Australia is one where
the immediate prospect is for
a contraction in overseas trade,
a slump in rural incomes, and
a drop in spending-power and

When a New Year comes, we stand in
contemplation of the past and wonder what the
future holds for us.
As Australians, I think we can look back
upon 1958 as generally a good year. The world
has been spared from war. And at home our
economy is showing a capacity for sound and
rapid growth.
Wool prices are lower. There has been a
temporary decline in farm income. But minerals
are coming up to give the national picture a wider
and more balanced sweep.
Production is rising.
Our factories are producing just on ninety-five
per cent, of all consumer goods used in the country.
Major developmental works planned for the
next few years—apart from the great Snowy
Mountains scheme —involve the spending of
£760-million, most of it on the key necessities of
power, water, and transport.
Early in 1959 the population will have passed
the ten-million mark, making a million added to
our numbers in four-and-a-half years.
The birth-rate is at a record high. And
migration continues.
That is the scene in its light and shadow, to
be viewed with neither fear nor easy acceptance.
Now, more than ever before, Faith must
underlie our thinking and acting. Economic cycles
come and go. But the enduring thing is in the
spirit with which we rise to the making of our far
goal and ultimate purpose.
We dare not rest, for example, in the thought
that Australia’s natural expansion is sufficient and
that problems will solve themselves.
At the entrance to the National Archives
building in Washington, D.C., there is a pillar
on which is carved the words: “What is past
is prologue.”
That fits well the inspiration which, I believe,
should fill us now at the dawn of another year.
All that has gone into 1958 —all that has come
from the 170 Australian years before it—is
prologue to what lies ahead.
Our task is to earn and to merit everything
that it holds for us.

capital-investment from these
and associated sources. The
overall prospect is one in which
economic activity should be
sustained even if there is dis-
turbance to some phases of
that activity. In many indus-
tries competition will grow
keener for the first six njonths
of the year at least, after which
there may be less competition
from imports.
The Sharemarkets
In the sharemarkets, the
shortage of good-quality scrip
is likely to continue, tending to
keep equity prices at a high
level, but already there is a
tendency on the part of inves-
tors to pay more regard to
second-line stocks which have
stood-up well to the harder
conditions of 1957-58 and to
give less frenzied support to
the chosen few in the front
row.
While the price-level remains
stable —as it seems likely to do
for some time —the 7 p.c. and
8 p.c. offered on secured and
unsecured notes by various
companies, including the
better-class hire-purchase con-
cerns, will continue to have
many attractions to the dis-
cerning investor. In the com-
ing year, however, it will be
interesting to see, with the
li.-p. business becoming more
competitive, whether the com-
panies. can go on offering such
attractive rates of interest. It
would not appear that lending-
money will become any more
plentiful in 1959 than it was in
1958, and interest-rates as a
whole seem hardly likely to
drop.
Takeovers Anonymous
'T'he wild men of Sydney last
week were sharebrokers
and minority shareholders still
trying to fathom the implica-
the deal between Ezra
Norton and an (at first) anony-
mous company financed with
Sydney “Herald” money for
the acquisition of a majority
holding of the ordinary shares
in Truth and Sportsman, Ltd.,
at an undisclosed price.
Whilst Ezra Norton, it may
be assumed, was quite satisfied
with the price he got for his
shares, minority shareholders
have been left sucking their
thumbs and wondering what it
is . all about. Those who
recently paid up to 765. for
their scrip (compared with last
week’s price of 595.) obviously
banked on a complete takeover
and payment of a price equal
to that to be received by Mr.
Norton. But so far there has
been no mention of any
acquisition (at any price) of the
minority shareholdings.
It turns out that a company,
at first anonymous but later
announced as O’Connell Pty.,
Ltd., of which R. A. Irish [chair-
man of Rothman’s of Pall Mall
(Aust.), Ltd., of Swift and Co.,
Ltd., and a director of sundry
other cos.] is chairman, is buy-
ing from Ezra Norton and
associates more than 50 p.c. of
the 300,000 ord. shares in Truth
and Sportsman, Ltd., Sydney,
publishers of the “Daily
Mirror,” “Sunday Mirror,”
“Truth” (inter-State) and sun-
dry other publications.
Mr. Irish says that “finance
for the purchase was arranged
through a subsidiary company
of John Fairfax, Ltd., but
Truth and Sportsman, Ltd.,
remains independent in every
respect. Neither John Fairfax,
Ltd., nor its subsidiaries nor
any nominees own any shares
in the purchasing company or
otherwise control it.”
Mr. Irish was formerly a
director of Associated News-
papers, Ltd., publishers of the
“Mirror’s” evening competitor
“The Sun,” before control of
Associated was acquired by the
Fairfax interests, publishers of
Sydney “Herald.”
The name of the takeover
company, revealed on Boxing
Day, has caused some specu-
-lati o n. Does the title
“O’Connell,” which at once
calls to mind the Irish patriot
Daniel O’Connell, signify any
connection or sympathy with
the D.L.P.? Or is it merely
nostalgia on Granny “Herald’s”
part for the street in which she
spent the most dignified years
of her life? Certain it is that
the names O’Connell and Fair-
fax seem about as far apart
as Dublin and London.
Directors of O’Connell Pty.,
Ltd., apart from Mr. Irish, are
William Buckingham, C. O.
Mant and A. S. V. Smith. Mr.
Smith is a director of A.E.1.,
Ltd., the C.C. engineering and
diecasting companies, John

In the past there has been
criticism of controlling-
interests in public companies
being sold to takeover con-
cerns at undisclosed prices,
with the minority shareholders
being paid what they consider
to be an unsatisfactory price or
else left as disgruntled partners
w'ith the new owners.
There has been criticism of
the takeovers of Coo-ee Cloth-
ing, Hampton Court and, more
recently, Rockman’s Show-
rooms.
How the Truth and Sports-
man deal is going to work-out
only time and more informa-
tion will tell. It would appear
that Sydney “Herald’s” interest
in the deal is a defensive one:
Warwick Fairfax has said that
his company feels control of
the “Truth” group “should not
fall into the hands of another
newspaper group.” Apparently
by this he means that it
shouldn’t be allowed to go to
Pac k e r’s “Telegraph” or
John Williams’s Melbourne
“Plerald.”
Melbourne “Herald” was a
negotiator for some consider-
able time before the deal with
the Irish-Fairfax interests went
through.
The deal may be summed-up
as one of financial convenience
to Ezra Norton and John Fair-
fax, Ltd., whatever particular
arrangements are being made.
In view of assurances being
given by Mr. Irish and Sydney
“Herald” people concerning
the continuance of the inde-
pendence of the “Truth”
publications it would be an
appropriate gesture at the pre-
sent time to give an assurance
that a place will always be
found on the board of Truth
and Sportsman, Ltd., for at
least two directors to be
appointed by minority
ordinary-shareholders.
The financial arrangements
so vaguely outlined are
peculiar in Sydney Stock
Exchange experience. Because
of their peculiarity, and be-
cause of the unease of minority
shareholders about partial
takeovers where the shares of
the major shareholders have
been bought at an undisclosed
price, the appropriateness of
representation on the “Truth”
board by minority share-
holders seems to be doubly
underlined.
Strong Sharemarket
A ustralian sharemarkets
closed for 1958 with signs
of a return to popularity of
the front-line stocks, with a
corresponding reduction in the
yield available from them.
With A.C.I. at 61s. 6d. the
return was only 4.1 p.c.,
which was, however, above the
3.4 p.c. offering from B.H.P.
at 495. Woolworths at 20s. 3d.
showed only 2.9 p.c. A simi-
lar yield was shown on 1.C.1.
at 61s. 9d.
These higher prices, how-
ever, were no more than the
re-establishment of previous
high—perhaps too - high—
levels. The most interesting
stocks continued to be the up-
and-coming second-liners.
There was a strong inquiry for
shares in Australian Cement
and Kandos Cement following
announcement of the fact that
the new 500,000-ton-p.a. plant
at Geelong was being run-in
satisfactorily and that com-
mercial production was to start
from the beginning of 1959.
Increased profits which are
expected to come from this new
unit will be largely used to
install a similar unit at Kandos
(N.S.W.) ; but in the long-run
there should be a handsome
pay-off. The cement industry
throughout the world is doing
extremely well with the
exception of the Metropolitan
Cement project at Maldon
(N.S.W.).
Cement and gypsum look
like being investments that will
show growth over the next
three years. The future of the
more involved electronic and
electrical industries that have
had such a spectacular run
recently is less assured.
The investor carefully pick-
ing his way through the varied
list of second-line stocks should
have an interesting time during
1959. There is a considerable
potential in this field.
Porosity and Permeability
T> eferences to “tight lime-
stone” (at the Puri well in
Papua, subsequently burnt-
away with acid to allow the oil
to flow from its reservoir-
sands) and to “porous and
permeable dolomite” in W.A.
have probably puzzled many
followers of the “mining and
oil” sharemarket.
In “Wapet News Digest”
experts of West Australian
Petroleum Pty. recently gave
a clear and simple explanation
of “porosity” and “perme-
ability,” and their implications
to the oil-driller.
In geological terms, the
word “porosity” is- used as
meaning the percentage of the
total volume of a type of rock
under examination that is taken
up by holes of one type or
another.
In limestones, for instance,
small holes are found through-
out the rock, often caused by
the stone being dissolved by
water flowing through it. In
other cases small cavities have
been left at some time when
the rock has re-crystallised
into crystals of a smaller,
denser form. In some reef-
limestone, pockets of air (which
were probably once filled with
sea-water) may be sealed-off
by a deposit of lime which has
occurred in such a way that
the void cannot be later filled
by sediment. This means
porosity without permeability.
Porosity in sandstone is more
easily explained. This stone
may be imagined as made up
of rounded grains like a heap
of billiard-balls, and the in-
evitable spaces between such
round grains create porosity—
unless natural cementing
agents have complicated things
by filling in this pore-space.
In oilfield rocks lime is the
cement most commonly found,
although silica is a close
second.
A rock may be porous with-
out any or many of the pore-
spaces . being interconnected,
like the limestone mentioned
above as having isolated
patches of pores cemented off
from each other without any
hope of becoming filled with
other material. This is often
the case when there are oil
or gas “showings” in a well,
without any more substantial
result. It means that if any of
the pore-spaces are filled with
hydrocarbon, only that in the
particular groups of pores cut
by the drill-hole can be
removed. Any hydrocarbons
in other pore-spaces are effec-
tively sealed and cannot be
produced.
If a formation is to have
any commercial value it is
obvious that the pore-spaces
must be interconnected in
some way which permits the
flow of oil through the rock
to the borehole from distant
parts of the formation. When
the pore-spaces are thus inter-
connected the rock is said to
have permeability.
Using the billiard-ball com-
parison again, the idea of
fluid flowing through the
spaces between the balls is
easy to visualise, and may be
•regarded as typical of perme-
ability in sandstones. Perme-
ability in limestones is harder
to imagine, but the little,
irregular pores must be con-
nected.
Taxing Visitors
"VIEW Zealand’s tax-system
' has recently been under
fire from overseas visitors.
Two airline executives, who
came to the country for one
day only, complained that they
were forced to spend part of
their time in the Inland
Revenue Department office try-
ing to get a tax-clearance to
get out again.
An Australian firm giving
expert advice to N.Z. on the
iron-and-steel industry is refus-
ing to send any more experts
to N.Z. because of the law that
taxes visiting Australians.
“If N.Z. wants to know
about the steel industry they
can come to see us,” it says,
in a huff.
The trouble has arisen as a
result of changes in tax legisla-
tion which became effective last
April. Formerly a person who
was visiting N.Z. and who
earned income here was entitled
to a full personal exemption
of £375, notwithstanding the
fact that he had been here for
a relatively short period. That
provision was repealed under
the new legislation.
The • problem arises mainly
in connection with visitors
from Australia, with which
there is no taxation agreement.
Tourists are not affected. As
genuine visitors, not earning
income in N.Z., they are not
subject to tax. The tax applies
only to those persons who are
visiting N.Z. and earning
income there, even though that
income may be payable in
another country.

A Brisbane “Messiah”
The “Messiah” has become
such an annual event with
choirs that it has inevitably
divided the musical world into
hostile camps. There are those
who loudly recommend (with-
out success) that it be dropped
in favor of some other master-
piece from the extremely rich
storehouse of choral music.
Others complain with justice
about the inflated perform-
ances given by enormous choirs
and orchestras far larger than
those Handel dreamed of for
this music.
The pity of it is that both
these groups seem to stay away
in large numbers anyway, for
at the annual summer perform-
ance in Brisbane there is hardly
a familiar face to be seen from
the other musical events of the
year. If the large audience that
does turn up is largely un-
musical, there is no reason why
the performance should not be
a more moving musical experi-
ence than it is at present. The
applause is so meagre that it
would be better if there were
none at all. The weather is
sticky, and the orchestral
players have to play their
instruments in an atmosphere
that makes intonation an
unpleasant problem. The
whole performance has the air
of a stale tradition complete
with the silly custom of stand-
ing for the “Hallelujah” Chords
merely because a gouty king
chose to ease his legs in this
way somewhere in the distant
past.
It is rumored that the
Queensland State and Muni-
cipal Choir is to perform the
“Messiah” as part of the
Queensland Centenary Cele-
brations. Perhaps at last the
performance will honor Handel
and not someone’s idea of a
choral jamboree. A small choir
and orchestra, all of trained
performers who can cope with
Handel’s difficult style, might
make the crusty old master-
piece sparkle like a penny
rubbed in sand.
The latest Brisbane perform-
ance underlined this need.
Alfred Grice carried-out a
small miracle in keeping the
lines of the music as clear as
he did with a choir composed
of a very small number of
tenors and basses surrounded
by bank upon bank of
sopranos and altos. Suppress-
ing the natural impulse of his
men to roar in an effort to be
heard, Mr. Grice managed to
subdue the ponderous sound of
too many amateur voices and
give a glimpse of what a hun-
dred trained voices might do
in producing music of speed
and lightness not incompatible
with dignity.
The quartet of soloists was
much stronger than usual.
Luisillo, who is back in Sydney, with his Spanish dancers, this
time at the Royal and with a second programme every bit as
good as his first.
Don Smith forsook the opera-
tic stage to give a ringing
account of the tenor solos,
rather close to Verdi at times,
but all the better for that in
solos that are frequently sung
too politely. Margaret Moore
made “Come Unto Him” mov-
ing in its simplicity and, like
the tenor, sang with complete
appreciation of the place of
her solos in the dramatic
whole. This is a point where
operatic training allows a
singer to make an oratorio
more than a succession of
dead-pan solos.
Contralto Joan Milford,
fighting with the other soloists
against a vicious storm that
rattled all" night on the roof of
the hall, maintained serenity,
and was at her best in “O Thou
That Tellest . . .” The baritone
was James Christiansen, sing-
ing a part really meant for a
deeper voice. Much of his
singing was impeccable, his
runs being very clear indeed.
But for music in which Handel
saw the heavens opening before
him, there was none of the
imperious tone that can easily
make this part the most com-
manding in the whole oratorio'.

Luisillo
On the opening-night of
Luisillo and his Spanish Dance
Theatre’s return - season at
Sydney Royal the lithe master
showed chiefly that his
energies can be successfully
diverted to more dramatic
patterns.
The rhythm and vivid Spanish
color which permeated his first
Sydney season are still there ;
the rich, swirling costumes of
his leading ladies are as
luxurious as ever and their
dancing quite as superb ; the
castanets and fingers are still
clicked with the same un-
beatable accuracy.
There seems to be an
increased dramatic element in
the show. In “The Prisoner,”
the captive (Luisillo) is behind
a stone wall and bars talking
to his fiancee (Teresa Amaya)
with his feet; the girl’s warm
tap-dancing is answered by the
prisoner’s strong and cell-
defying beat; she tosses a rose
through the bars and disap-
pears in a flurry of skirt, leav-
ing her lover suspended single-
handed from the Bft. cell-bars.
“Blood on the Moon” is
another tense one, again with
high-heeled boots the only
method of communication: a
romance between a boy and
girl of opposing gipsy families,
with a tragic ending for the
young man at the hands of the
girl’s kinsmen.
Altogether there are nine
new ballets, coupfed with two
“repeats”: the brilliant “Giants
and Big Heads,” with its spec-
tacular conclusion as the cast
reach a frenzy of fast foot-
movement ; and “Botilleria de
los Faroles,” which, to this
commentator, might mean any-
thing, but most of all a fine
and spirited bit of ballet set
in a Spanish tavern.

Notable “Rosenkavalier”
[From London]
Who was right, Hofmanns-
thal, the librettist, or Richard
Strauss, the composer? The
one conceived a realistic,
cynical and penetrating story
of 18th-century turpitude in
which, despite the turning of
the tables on the libidinous
Baron Ochs, the essence is the
moral rottenness of the nobility
at the court of Maria Theresa.
The other, besides creating
arias of Mozartian delicacy
and loveliness, accorded the
libretto a treatment as effu-
sively romantic as his earlier
namesake gave to “Die
Fledermaus.”
Not only is this fundamental
conflict much too strong to be
resolved, either by producer
or critic, but there are also
other troubles. The dialogue is
coarse, even objectionable ; the
acting demands on the singers,
especially in the over-
long scenes, call for the
extended technique of an Ash-
croft or an Olivier ; the music
is difficult of execution ; and
the score is so lush that, given
the usual ornate setting and
costumes, its very extravagance
tends to cloy.
Christopher West’s Covent
Garden production is nicely
tempered to the two concep-
tions. He leaves all the crudity

to the Ochs of James Pease,
but overdoes neither the
romanticism nor the interplay
between the characters. This
interpretation of Ochs is open
to criticism for being too oafish
—he is the composer’s own
“Burger als Edelman” rather
than a nobleman turned dis-
solute—but, largely because
the other principals are not so
gifted with their acting as with
their singing, his comic gro-
tesqueness helps to sustain the
opera through its length.
New singers bring interest as
well as distinction. Claire
Watson, an American from
Frankfurt, is a youthful Feld-
marschallin. Her voice, though
clear and true and musicianly,
at first seems too slight and,
as with her acting, diffident,
but by the last act she rises to
eloquent power and dignity in
her. Olivia-like role.
Hertha Topper, a German
from Munich, is perforce
inhibited by language diffi-
culties (the opera is in English)
and the Prince Charming get-
up as Octavian, but her singing
is faultless. Joan Carlyle is a
little wooden as Sophie, but,
broadly speaking, the standard
of A all is high. Especially
memorable are Barbara
Howitt’s Annina and William
McAlpine’s two-minute appear-
ance as the Tenor (a cameo
which, by his clear enunciation
and full voice, might have
inspired the others to make
themselves better heard).
Rudolf Kempe’s command
of the orchestra, regard for the
singers and interpretation of
the complex score are super-
lative. The only shortcoming is
a lack of finesse and wit, which,
however, could well develop in
further performance.

1.C.1.
Miss Jessie Traill—who at
78 must be the doyen of Mel-
bourne women artists, and who
has just returned from Europe
with 11 big suitcases, bags and
bundles containing scores of
paintings, etchings and sketches
—has already been up to the
top of the new 1.C.1. building.
She said, “I suppose it’s useful,
but it's terribly square.”
It can’t be denied that that is
an apt comment, but how
could it be otherwise? Modern
life requires usefulness, and
usefulness implies squareness,
and this is exemplified in the
1.C.1. building, which towers
foursquare and 275 ft. 4in. high
above Melbourne’s pavements
—2sft. less than the spire of
St. Pat’s Cathedral adjacent,
but dwarfing the new Com-
monwealth Public Service
building immediately'below it.
Nor can it be denied that
it is terribly useful. It has
space for 1500 office-workers,
eight lifts for raising them to
their 1058 desks and tables at
500 ft. a minute, a car-park for
65 cars in the basement, a can-
teen to seat 400, a theatrette,
a telephone switchboard taking
up to 800 extensions, 1000
vvastepaper-baskets and 700
ashtrays. It also has an air-
conditioning and refrigerator-
plant capable of producing 22
tons of ice per hour, which
keeps the great glasshouse
warm in winter, and in summer
tempers the sun to the shorn
clerk when it pours through
the three acres of glass with
their 15 tons of putty. There
is a nervous-system of 153
miles of electric-cable to carry
all this usefulness to the fur-
thest extremity of the fantastic
monster. To make the monster
possible 10,000 truckloads of
soil and rock had to be
excavated, and a beautiful little
old bluestone building which
stood on the site had to be
immolated ; and this has to be
regretted, but how could it
be avoided —construction in-
volves destruction.
The architects of 1.C.1. can
be proud of their achievement.
A modernist painter would be
driven frantic with excitement
by the extraordinary patterns
given by the liftwells and the
22 stories, each exactly like the
last one, each with its glass
partitions, its desk-calendars
and ashtrays and its gigantic
cacti and monstrous philoden-
drons on each landing; and
anybody would be excited with
the view from the top, which
is tremendous.
On a clear day you can see
the Heads and a bit of Bass
Strait, Sorrento, the snow on
the Alps, Macedon and the
Youyangs, the courses of the
Maribyrnong and the Yarra,
Williamstown with its historic
foreshore and, instead of wind-
jammers, yachts and modern
liners. Nearer in you can see
the little old church where
Governor Latrobe worshipped,
Little Lon forgetting its past in
more modern buildings,
Bourke and Collins Streets
strangely alive with glittering
motor traffic ; also the back-
yard of Parliament House with
its midget cricket-pitch to
which members can retire when
a debate bores them.
M.G.S.
FILMS OF 1958
One of the features of the
celluloid scene calculated to
send Hebe bearing extra-choice
nectar to the celebrating gods
and equally grateful critics to
hop in with zest to their suds
was the sparer use made by
film-makers of the Talentless
Bosoms during 1958. The few
films in which appeared the
Dors, the Mansfield and the
Bardot—Jane Russell seems to
have been tossed into the
discard —were all fourth-rate,
possibly because no producer
would be silly enough to waste
a good story on them.
Marilyn Monroe was seen in
only one, “The Prince and the
Showgirl,” in which for the
umpteenth time she took the
only role of which she appears
capable of handling—that of
a dumb blonde. That normally
shrewd producer Sir Laurence
Olivier teamed with Miss
Monroe, but the film was still
a flop.
Spectacle Films
Cinerama, a new technique
involving a gigantic screen,
three projectors and a multi-
plicity of strategically-placed
speakers, made its debut at
Sydney Plaza, where it is now
entering its fifth month. With
its color-cameras able to range
over vast expanses, it is an
ideal medium for recording
such things as Niagara Falls,
the Grand Canyon (from a
plane flying between its
ramparts) and other interesting
novelties. For some time it
seems likely to be confined to
documentary material.
Another new medium was
Todd-A.0., applied with spec-
tacular success to one of the>
best filmed musicals yet —
Rodgers and Hammerstein’s
“South Pacific,” now starting
what should be a long ruft at
Sydney Mayfair (it will be
reviewed here next week).
Cecil B. De Mille’s remake
of his “Ten Commandments”
had a record six-months’ run
at Sydney Prince Edward, more
because of its spectacular
qualities than any dramatic
punch although Charlton
Heston did make a dignified
Moses.
War Filins
Easily heading this big field
was the Rank organisation’s
“Bridge on the River Kwai,”
which won every award about
the place and served to confirm
—if confirmation were needed
—that Alec Guinness, who
played the dedicated, fanatical
British p.-0.-w. colonel, is an
actor of wonderful skill and
versatility.
The other good war-films
came from British studios.
“Dunkirk” was a fine account
of the big escape from the
French port, starring John
Mills; “Carve Her Name
with Pride” had Virginia Mc-
Kenna as George Cross winner
Violette Szabo, who was para-
chuted into France to help
stiffen the Resistance ; “111 Met
by Moonlight,” starring Dirk
Bogarde, was an exciting
factual story of the kidnap-
ping by British agents from
enemy-held Crete of the major-
general commanding 30,000
German paratroopers; “The
One That Got Away” dealt
with the only escape. from
British p.-0.-w. camps by a
German —fighter-pilot Franz
von Werra.
The best war-film to come
out of Hollywood was “The
Silent Enemy,” a sound* study
of the struggle of minds be-
tween a U-boat captain (Curt
Jurgens) and the skipper of a
pursuing U.S. destroyer
(Robert Mitchum).
General Drama
Some worth-while ones were
thrown up in this sphere. With
a performance of remarkable
insight and sympathy, Joanne
Woodward showed her swift
improvement in the role of a
young wife who is the victim
of split-personality in “The
Three Faces of Eve.” Agatha
Christie’s tense thriller with
the double-denouement, “Wit-
ness For the Prosecution,”
brought a rich characterisa-
tion from Charles Laughton
as the defending Q.C. Reality
got a good work-out in “The
Garment Jungle,” with that
fine actor Lee Cobb as a ruth-
less manufacturer who finally


falls victim to the union
gangsters with whom he has
played along ; in “A Face In
the Crowd,” Elia Kazan’s
penetrating picture of the
sickening adulation of a built-
up mediocre entertainer who
gets political ambitions; and
in “Sweet Smell of Success,”
which took a solid crack at
the egotistical gossip-columnist.
“Hot Spell” and “The Long
Hot Summer” were sharply
limned reflections of passions
and frayed tempers in un-
stable characters in the sultri-
ness of the Deep South. “I
Accuse,” the story of the
persecution of Captain Drey-
fus by the French General
Staff, was historically sound
and had the competent Jose
Ferrer as Dreyfus.
Domestic drama was well
served: “Bachelor Party” was
an intelligent study of a little
group of clerks and their indi-
vidual reactions to a night-
out to celebrate the approach-
ing marriage of one of them ;
“No Down Payment” involved
several young married couples
who set-up house in a new
suburban settlement; “Peyton
Place” was small-town drama
of rewarding observation ;
“Ten North Frederick” had
Gary Cooper as a father whose
romance with his daughter’s
girl-friend was the core of the
drama ; and “Wild is the
Wind” had Anna Magnani
doing good work as the new
wife who marries her dead
sister's husband and has to
fight to establish herself.
Another good film, a mixture
of comedy and drama out of
Ireland, was “The Rising of
the Moon,” a trilogy directed
by John Ford and with mem-
bers of the Abbey Players in
the cast.
Comedy
Charles Chaplin, whose rare
films are always an event, came
to light with “A King in New
York,” a story about a visiting
monarch of a near-broke
comic - opera kingdom. As
well as writing the script
and the music, and direct-
ing the film, the comedian
showed that he still has a superb
comedy-touch, getting-in some
good digs at TV, high-pressure
advertising and rock-’n’-roll
addicts.
“Don’t Go Near the Water”
was a hilarious account of
press-relations pother in a U.S.
Navy-base ; “Gigi” was a light-
hearted and cynical excursion
into the unmorals of turn-of-
the century Paris, complete
with the inimitable Maurice
Chevalier and the music-and-
lyrics teamwork of Lerner and
Loewe; “Imitation General”
was an Army comedy with the
reliable Glenn Ford exacting
easy laughs in the title-role;
Danny Kaye fooled delight-
fully in “Merry Andrew” ; and
“Teacher’s Pet” was a snappy
newspaper comedy with Clark
Gable carrying the chief
burden.
Foreign Films
France supplied most of
these, ranging from the drama
of “Gervaise,” based on Zola’s
The Drunkard , to the impudent
comedy of “Nights of Cabiria,”
in which Giulietta Masina
followed up her good work in
“La Strada” with a clinking
performance as the little street-
battler of Rome whose ebullient
spirit is proof against a suc-
cession of misfortunes.
Two Dostoievsky novels
were transposed for the screen
with fair success: in “Crime
and Punishment” the con-
science-tortured murderer was
well drawn ; in “The Brothers
Karamazov” the monumental
tome was reduced to 140
minutes running-time, and the
outstanding performance given
by Lee Cobb, as the roaring,
lusty father.
A Soviet film, “The Forty-
first,” merited praise for the
artistic photography and a
plain love-story told without
propaganda-strings. Japan was
represented by ‘Tales of
Ugetsu,” a costume-drama of
the Bushido knights, and
artistically only a fraction
behind “Rashomon” and “The
Gates of Hell.”
Germany provided an
engaging musical in “Mozart,”
which stuck close to the known
facts of Mozart’s romantic life
and was shot-through with
some of his loveliest music.
On the other hand, “The
Young Chopin” was a poor
attempt to portray the Pole’s
sympathy with his compatriots
battling in Warsaw against
the occupying Russians.
A Mixed Bag
Of the screen-versions of
contemporary literature, the
outstanding effort was “The
Paths of Glory,” which dealt
with the colossal egotism of a
French general who has the
innocent victims of his malice
shot for cowardice; Kirk
Douglas stood out. Irwin
Shaw’s “The Young Lions”
suffered from the grafting-on
of a happy ending which was
foreign to the author’s inten-
tion.
“The Bolshoi Ballet,” with
Ulanova, was a gift for the
balletomanes, the offerings
including a superbly danced
“Giselle” and the whole of the
ballets from “Faust.”
Pick of the tootin’-shootin’s
were “The Sheepman” and
“The 3.10 to Yuma,” both
starring Glenn Ford ; “The
Law and Jake Wade,” with
Robert Taylor; and “Man-
hunt,” with Don Murray.
Current Releases
“Smiley Gets a Gun”
This, the second of the Aus-
tralian-set Smiley films from
director Anthony Kimmins,
has young Keith Calvert re-
placing Colin Peterson as the
chief character, and it’s a toss-
up who is the better. Like his
predecessor, Calvert is allowed
to-be just a healthy youngster
chockful of life, vim and mis-
chief.
This time Smiley is promised
a pea-rifle by the police-
sergeant—Chips Rafferty is
that stern, just and humorous
character again—if he can keep
out of the hair of the local
populace long enough to earn
marks for good works. It’s a
tough assignment, particularly
for one born with a fatal flair
for getting into hot water, but
he finally makes it, partly with
the aid of a richly drawn vil-
lage eccentric (Sybil Thorn-
dike) who guards her hoard of
sovereigns. Ruth Cracknell’s
untalented village organist and
songstress is a little gem.
The country around Camden
(N.S.W.) is finely treated by
the color-cameras, and there is
no overstressing of the wattle-
and-daub stuff —just an authen-
tic touch of the bush, Austra-
lian but not aggressively so.

“The Force of Destiny”
Verdi’s gloom-ridden opera
—it is not one of his best —
comes to the screen murkily
and stagily-stodgy in this
Italian film. It is probably the
silliest vengeance-plot ever
hatched, and although the
voices of Tito Gobbi, Nelli
Corradi and Gina Seninbrech
are acceptable enough, they
don’t seem to be coming from
the direction of their faces.
Obfuscated narration and
poor sub-titles in English don't
help.

“The Perfect Furlough”
To relieve dangerous rest-
lessness in a bunch of girl-
starved G.l.’s who have been
on duty up near the North
Pole for seven months, the
Army psychologists decide that
one of the soldiers shall be
chosen by raffle to go on leave
to Paris, the type of furlough
to be chosen by them all in
concert, so that the unlucky
ones may vicariously enjoy the
whale of a time being had by
the winner.
The Army co-opts the ser-
vices of a glamorous Argen-
tinian film-star to be the one
whom the winner will escort,
but a frigid and efficient lady
lootnent hops along with ’em
to chaperon the doings. With
such a three-cornered set-up
the opportunities for fun are
wide open, and the script-
writers have done themselves
proud as to comedy-situations
and snappy dialogue.
Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis
—who shows a flair for easy
comedy—are the Army’s reps.
Linda Cristal is the shapely
bearer of the Latin-American
banner.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Bitumen and Oil Refineries (Aust.)
A4"idway through 1957 local oil-
refineries lost the protection pre-
viously afforded them by the primage on
imported gasoline and other refined oils.
The removal of the primage, averaging
around Iyd. a gallon, was followed by
corresponding reductions in the price, to
marketing-concerns, of locally-refined
products, and as this price is based, firstly,
on overseas quotations, a substantial fall
in world prices resulted in a considerable
overall reduction.
These two factors, both of them beyond
the control of the co., slashed the earn-
ings of Bitumen and Oil Refineries
(Australia), Ltd., last term and ord. share-
holders can thank an increase in sales-
volume for the repetition of the 15 p.c.
div., last term’s barely covered payout
being the seventh successive distribution
on this scale.
One of the early post-war floats, Boral
was launched in 1946 with the support
of California Texas Corp. of U.S.A.,
which put-up 40 p.c. of ord. capital and
contracted to supply up to 1,000,000
barrels of crude annually. The Matra-
ville (Sydney) refinery commenced pro-
duction, mainly of bitumen, in 1948 and,
after some disagreement with California
Texas, the range of products was
extended to include high-grade motor-
spirit, diesel distillates, etc., a catalytic-
reformer (platformer) unit being installed
in 1952. Last term’s difficulties ended a
six-year run of quite attractive profits.
Queensland Oil Refineries Pty. was set-
up as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1954
and erected a small refinery near Bris-
bane. The co. is mainly concerned with
the production of bituminous products
and road-construction work, as is a
second subsidiary, W. B. Carr Construc-
tions Pty., which operates in N.S.W. and
Victoria.
Boral is a substantial shareholder in
Petroleum and Chemical Corp. (Aus-
tralia), Ltd. (“Paccal”), and supplies that
co. with residual oils used, for gas-
making, etc., in its high-temperature
cracking - plant at Silverwater (Sydney).
Plagued firstly by plant - troubles, and
then by uneconomic prices for its oil-gas,
Paccal has yet to pay a div.
(In association with Monsanto Chemi-
cals, Paccal is currently investigating the
possibilities of manufacturing styrene-
monomer from ethylene and benzene
produced at Silverwater. The success of
this venture could change the co.’s
fortunes.)
Simultaneous bonus (one-for-five) and
cash (two-for-five) issues in 1955 took
Boral’s ord. capital to £2,000,000, another
£500,000 being raised on 7-8 p.c. redeem-
able prefs. in 1956. The additional capital
was required to finance extensions to the
Matraville refinery, the completion of
plant-extensions, last June, lifting refining-
capacity to over 15,000 barrels a day, as
against 10,000 barrels a day two years
earlier.
Although the full benefit of this
increase should be felt in the current year,
it provided some compensation last term
for the decline in profit-margins, which,
along with the drop in stock-values, was
chiefly responsible for the 25 p.c. fall in
net earnings. As claimed, group profit
was down by £115,777 at £343,805, after
providing £271,629 (up £24,534) for
depreciation, but the preceding term’s
tax-provision was well in excess of the
amount called-for by the published profit,
and the much smaller tax-provision last
term (down £188,250 at £205,750) sug-
gests a drop in taxable income of close
to £500,000:

Both subsidiaries turned-in better
results, Queensland Oil Refineries’ pre-
tax profit increasing by £16,679 to
£127,141, and that of W. B. Carr Con-
structions by £9491 to £44,253. These
contributions were undoubtedly most
welcome, for, all told, group earnings
exceeded div.-requirements by only
£3805, covering the 8 p.c. pref. div. and
15.2 p.c. on ord. capital, compared with
21 p.c. in 1957 and 23.2, 31.6, 37.8 and

Q.O.R. is at present setting-up a bulk-
bitumen terminal at the North Queens-
land centre of Townsville, and a further
improvement in profit is expected this
year.
A heavy outlay on plant, etc. (a net
£617,039), ate into working-capital again
last term, and despite the injection of
another £300,000 of debenture-money, the
surplus of current assets over current
liabilities and provisions shrank by

The actual amount owing to creditors
(largely under letters-of-credit relating to
supplies of crude) was little changed, and
compared favorably with the £454,503
increase in stocks. In the accounts, how-
ever, it is shown after deducting cash at
bank, etc., and a sharp reduction in this
item caused the big (£1,011,857) jump in
the net figure..
The Tariff Board recently completed
another inquiry into the cost-structure of
the growing Australian oil-refining
industry, but its recommendations on
requests for additional protection have
yet to be published. Unless some assist-
ance of this type is forthcoming, Boral
has little chance in the current term of
regaining much of the ground lost last
term, although a bigger output and the
production of a range of solvents should
add something to earnings. ' Confident
of holding the 15 p.c. div. -rate, the
board, nevertheless, adds some perspec-
tive to the picture by claiming that this
would be “a worth-while accomplish-
ment” under existing circumstances.
The sharemarket is of much the same
opinion and prices the f.-p. £1 ords. at
445. to return £6 16s. sd. p.c. from
a 15 p.c. distribution. Consolidated
accounts at June 30 last gave each ord.
a net tangible cover of 335. sd.
E.M.I. (Australia), Ltd.
r T~'HE TV boom gave a mighty lift to
E.M.l.’s earnings last term, and in
the first complete year since the public
obtained a stake in the U.K.-controlled
co., the ord. div-rate was raised from
8 to 10 p.c. and the still comparatively
small reserves more than doubled.
Although the juicy profit was won
under particularly favorable conditions,
it would probably take a rather severe
jolt to endanger the higher div.-rate, and
the f.-p. £1 ords., which were selling at
around 275. six months ago, are currently
fetching 38s. 6d., after reaching a “high”
of 40s. last September. Freeholds were
revalued and bonus scrip issued imme-
diately prior to the introduction of public
money, and, at £5 3s. 11. p.c., the yield
from a 10 p.c. div. at 38s. 6d. is some-
what higher than the indicated yields

from listed equities in some other leading
TV-manufacturers.
E.M.I. takes its name from Electric
and Musical Industries, Ltd., the U.K.
parent co.; which is itself associated with
another big U.K. radio and electronics
group. The local co. s manufactuiing
interests date back to 1925, when the
English Gramophone Co. set-up a record-
factory in Sydney, subsequent mergers
uniting the Australian branches of the
Gramophone Co. and those of two other
U.K. manufacturers, Columbia Grapho-
phone and Parlophone.
The group commenced production of
radio-receivers in 1936 and is today one
of the leading manufacturers in the radio
and television fields as well as the largest
producer of records in the country. Air-
conditioning units, refrigerators, washing-
machines and other domestic-appliances
are manufactured for E.M.1., •and, along
with many of its own products, marketed
throughout Australia under the well-
known “His Master’s Voice’’ brand-
name. Among the large number of record-
labels either owned by, or available to,
the co. are those of H.M.V., Columbia,
Parlophone, Decca, Regal - Zonophone,
Capitol and M.G.M.
Half of E.M.l.’s £1,000,000 ord.
capital was put-up by the public in June,
1957, after Electric and Musical Indus-
tries had collected 248,250 £1 ords. in
satisfaction of a debt, to raise its holding
to 500,000 ords. At the same time the
English co. received 300,000 £1 deferred
ords. by way of a bonus-issue, the
deferred scrip participating in divs. up to
5 p.c. only after ord. shareholders have
been paid 8 p.c., with the 3 p.c. margin
being maintained in the event of the ord.
div.-rate exceeding 8 p.c. The period
of deferment expires after the ords. have
received divs. of not less than 8 p.c. for
five years in succession.
Australian production of TV-receivers
jumped from 126,500 sets in 1956-57 to
285,300 sets in 1957-58 and, with demand
well in line with output over the period,
the TV side of E.M.l.'s business bounded
ahead last term, bringing about a “very
considerable” increase in turnover and
an 86.6 p.c. leap in net earnings, up
£140,340 at £302,341:

Sales of products outside the TV range
were “generally the same as in the pre-
ceding year.” In this regard it is interest-
ing to note that, contrary to expectations,
Australian output of radio-sets actually
increased slightly over the last financial
year., while the number of 45-r.p.m.
records produced rose from 2,682,000 to
4,145,000, a decline in the total number
of records produced being confined,
largely, to the outmoded 78-r.p.m. disk.
Written after setting aside £193,000 (up
£86,600) for taxation and £136,498
(up £33,492) for depreciation, the
£302,341 profit represented 23.2 p.c. on
paid capital, or 23.9 p.c. on the ords. after
allowing for the rights of the deferreds,
compared with 12.5 p.c. and 13.2 p.c.,
respectively, in the previous year. Based
on the present capital and adjusted to
cover participation by the deferreds, pros-
pectus figures showed an earning-rate
on ord. capital of 13.6 p.c. in 1954, 12 p.c.
in 1955 and 11.47 p.c. in 1956.
A rather surprising slip in stocks (down
£13,075) last term tends to support the
board’s statement that, at times, the group
was hard put to meet the demand for
TV-receivers, the swifter tempo of sales
and production showing-up in book-debts
(up £340,887) and creditors, etc. (up
£230,352). As the capital raised by public
subscription in 1957 was sought primarily
to replace long-term advances by the
parent co. it had little direct effect on
working-capital, the deferred liability to
the parent being reduced last term by
£511,914, partly with the proceeds, from
a £250,000 mortgage-loan. The greater
volume of business and the use of funds
to cut deferred liabilities left current
finances somewhat tighter, working-
capital dropping by £116,004 to £735,778
over the year and the ratio of current
assets to current liabilities from 2.05 : 1
to 1.6 : 1: y

As a public co. E.M.I. hasn’t had much
time to accumulate a great deal in the
way of reserves, and at balance-date there
was 255. 3d. in net tangible assets for
each £1 of paid capital. However, during
the period of deferment the deferreds
rank after the ords. for return of capital,
giving the ords. a net tangible cover of
265. lOd.
Although fierce competition and, pos-
sibly, a weakening in Victorian and
N.S.W. demand for TV-receivers may
hinder progress in the second half of the
current term, there is still quite a lot
more profit to be wrung-out of the TV
business yet and good results are reported
for the first quarter of the year.
Nevertheless, the boom can’t last for
ever, and profit-margins are, no doubt,
past their peak, while production, even
allowing for normal, seasonal variations,
has tended to decline in recent months.
The next big stimulus to output may come
with the extension of TV-services to
Brisbane and Adelaide late in 1959, and
to Perth and Hobart early in 1960, so
that the calendar-year of 1959 could still
see record production-figures. At the
same time, it is worth noting that the
new services will cover cities with a
combined population smaller, by two-
million people, than that of Sydney and
Melbourne.
Aust. National Industries
T ike Gaul, Australian National Indus-
tries is divided naturally into three
parts, which are best considered sepa-
rately in analysing the current atrophy
of the earning-rate.
They are (a) indenting and merchan-
dising of steel and engineering products ;
( b ) distribution of cars and commercial
vehicles ; (c) fabrication and forging of
ferrous and non-ferrous metal products.
Broadly speaking, the first two groups
were the losers on the year's trading,
while the third category kept the whole
rather ill-knit group wanly profitable.
The group operates in all States, but
principally in New South Wales and Vic-
toria. Merchandising (non-vehicle) is in
the hands of the Perkins group of com-
panies, vehicle outlets retain the McGrath
label, and, on the manufacturing side,
Australian Forge and Engineering Pty.
and National Forge Pty. are the big
names. All told, there are upwards of
a score of subsidiaries of varying capi-
talisations.
Australian National Industries is the
quondam John McGrath Industries,
itself an outgrowth of John McGrath,
Ltd., which was registered as far back
as 1911. The forerunner company waxed
fat on the Chevrolet agency during the
’twenties, subsequently changed its alle-
giance to the Rootes people, and then
built-up its sideline manufacturing in-
dustries during the war until today they
represent the chief prop of the business.
Over the past 12 years, paid capital
has been jacked-up tenfold, and about
half this increase has taken the form
of bonus-scrip (mainly under the guise
of a reconstruction). Now, of course, it

The 1957-58 consolidated net
profit of £82,965 —less than
half that shown in 1956-57 and
little more than a quarter of
the 1954-55 peak—came to
light after the usual provisions,
£167.797 for depreciation
(1957, £213,524) and £130,968
(£156,413) for taxation.
The lower charge last term
for depreciation, although
seemingly adequate, disguises
the real extent of the decline
in earnings, since, “as the board
considers that the value of
freehold land and buildings as
shown in the accounts is below
the present-day market, no
depreciation has been provided
in this year’s accounts on
freehold buildings.” Therefore,
placed on a comparative basis
with previous years, the latest
profit would have shown-up
closer to £37,000, a pepper-
corn return on shareholders’
funds.
The taxation provision,
which seems at first glance
anomalous, finds its justifica-
tion in the fact that some sub-
sidiaries made losses, others
profits, and that they are taxed
individually.
It further indicates that the
successful offshoots possibly
made a post-tax profit of over
£200,000, and that hopes of a
return to even a moderately
reasonable dividend basis lie
in getting the others to at least
a break-even point.
There seems little likelihood
that the immediate future will
bring this to pass. On the
cards is a revision of the
Government’s present import-
licencing policies later in the
financial year, and A.N.l.’s
indenting activities could suffer
in consequence.
Most important, A.N.I. has
severed its ties with the Rootes
group and taken on the Ford
Motor Co.’s range of light
English cars, Consul, Prefect,
Anglia, and the Thames series
of commercials.
In the long-run this realign-
ment will probably prove its
worth, since the Ford Motor
Co. has an Australian-built
Ford coming up for the local
market. For the present, the
changeover to the new fran-
chises is proving a costly pro-
position for A.N.1., and results
so far have been disappointing.
Some inherent weaknesses in
the consolidated financial
structure are apparent from

the year by £394,610. Current
liabilities fell rather less in
proportion, and there was a
further weakening in the
working-capital position.

in bank-overdraft (down
£443,118), plant (net increase

The overall picture is far
from rosy, and the board hasn’t
gilded the future. Although
the problem of centralising and
rationalising the whole group’s
activities is being tackled with
vigor, “it is not visualised that

,be achieved for the financial
year ending 31st July, 1959,

losses . . .”

East African Coffee Planta-
tions, Ltd.
'T’ime was, until a decade or so
ago, when E. A. Coffee’s
scrip was about as popular as
Confederate greenbacks. And
no wonder; 20 years had
rolled by since barrier-rise, and
report after report had carried
never a suggestion of a. divi-
dend.
The planter was formed in
Melbourne in 1928 to grow
coffee in Kenya, where it took
over extensive holdings, partly
freehold, partly on a 99-year
lease, in the Nandi and
Kiambu uplands.
Before it could even get to
the toddling stage coffee-
trees aren't money-spinners
until the third year, and reach
maturity only in the fifth or
sixth year—the depression of
the 1930’s struck. In 1934 half
the £150,000 of ordinary
capital Was cancelled and
£15,000 of 7 p.c. pref. money
gathered in as a stop-gap.
Arrears of pref.-dividends and
other deferred liabilities were
carried in the books until 1948,
when they were finally cleared.
A 7 p.c. dividend in 1949
heralded a very big improve-
ment. Since then, apart from
magnificent dividends, share-
holders have had a royal time
with bonus-issues. So far, the
written-down equity-capital has
been increased ninefold by
issues of one-for-one in 1950,
two-for-one in 1954, and one-
for-two in 1956. Sharing, too,
in this were the prefs., con-
verted to ords. in 1950.
And now the dividend-rate
has been cut back to a
comparatively modest lOf p.c.,
but the profits continue to roll
in ever higher. Last year’s
was a net £137,085 (up
£34,172). This new record was
scored in the face of steadier,
but still buoyant, markets for
coffee and the company’s other
cash crop, tea, and the profit
was struck after providing
£7212 for depreciation (£5450
in 1956-57) and £39,368 for
Kenya Colony taxation (pre-
vious year's provision unstated),
an amount including £1620
underprovided in the 1957
term. Basic rates for Kenya
company-tax, incidentally, are
EA ss. 50 cents (= stg. ss. 6d.)
on distributed earnings, EA
9.55. on undistributed, but


there are reliefs for agriculture
and other industries.

Possibly because it is so
close to its natural home, the
coffee grown in Kenya is very
high grade, of the variety
“Arabica,” and commanding
a premium in world markets,
has, perhaps, a steadier sale
than the more universal
Brazilian crop. Like tea, it
is grown in Kenya chiefly
through corporations on the
plantation system by labor
drawn from “squatters”—
African families who live on,
and are sustained by, European
farms.
There have been dangerous
outbreaks of inter-racial hatreds
which, although not directly
affecting E. A. Coffee, have
introduced a risk element
which must be considered by
investors who propose locking-
up their money for any length
of time in this particular stock.
There was, in 1953, and sub-
sequent years, the Mau Mau
emergency, and the passive
resistance of the Kikuyu tribe,
who quit the White Highland
farms and returned to the
reserves.
Even granted that Kenya
isn’t very far along the Ghana
road, there will be internal
and external pressures to lift
the prevailing low standard of
native wages, which may tend
to whittla-down the present
earning-rate.
The yield of 8.3 p.c. from
13s. a share has to be con-
sidered in the light of the fore-
going.
Report No. 41
[From Ij. Owen]
'T'he Department of National
Development, through its
Bureau of Mineral Resources,
has issued a summary, cover-
ing 101 pages, of oil-explora-
tion activities throughout
Australia and New Guinea to
the end of 1957.
Such a summary, under one
cover, is a welcome aid to any-
one who has, normally, to
search through a widely-
scattered —and often almost
inaccessible —series of pamph-
lets, papers and journals to
obtain Australian petroleum
data.
Personally, I am deeply
grateful that such a volume
has been made available. I
trust that it will be kept up to
date—-at least biennially—with
supplements after the style of
the department’s “Quarterly
Reviews,” until a complete
reprint is called for.
The criticisms and suggested
amendments which here are
offered are given in the hope
that they will increase the use-
fulness of any reissue.
As a first change, the subject-
matter is so largely statistical
that much of it could be better
handled by the Commonwealth
Statistician, as, in fact, is done
in the “Quarterly Reviews.”
Apart from that, my other
criticisms are directed towards
details in the letterpress, which,
on the whole, is commendably
fiee from error.
In the Introduction, “dry
gas” is defined as “inflammable
gas without ethane or higher
hydrocarbons.” Such a defini-
tion conflicts with general
petroleum practice, which
classes as “dry” any gas con-
taining less than 0.1 U.S.
gallons of condensable petro-
leum-vapors per 1000 cubic-
feet. A “dry” gas may thus
contain not only a large
amount of ethane but also con-
siderable quantities of butane
and propane. On the same
page it is stated that only sedi-
mentary rocks, not strongly
indurated or deformed, occupy
the sedimentary basins referred
to in the report. This, of
course, is not correct.
On page 7, the date of Kuru
1 is given as 1950 ; it should
be 1956. The “structural” map
of Western Papua indicates,
but does not define, “troughs,”
“basins” and “shelves” and is
liable to misinterpretation by
anyone not familiar with the
geology of the area.
On the other hand, I am in
agreement with the implication
(p. 12) that insufficient use of
geophysics has been made in
Papua for extending our know-
ledge of the conditions, both
laterally and in depth, of well-
exposed and carefully studied
surface structures, where these
are hidden under suitable ter-
rain. Unfortunately, the word-
ing of the report is rather
ambiguous, particularly in the
summary on p. 62. It should
be made clear that, to obtain
reasonably accurate interpreta-
tions of geophysical surveys,
conjoint stratigraphical drill-
ing should be undertaken.
Throughout the report, how-
ever, there is a suggestion of
unshaken faith in the results of
uncontrolled seismic surveys, in
spite of the many discrepancies
between geophysical forecast
and drilling-log on the Austra-
lian mainland.
In contrast, it is a pleasure
to find quoted the concise
analysis by Whitehouse (p. 22)
of the structure of the Great
Artesian Basin.
A surprising feature of
Report 41 is the occasional
reliance on press-releases, when
the Bureau could easily —and
probably compulsorily—obtain
official confirmation.
A statement which requires
modification is that (p. 50)
Rough Range wells “3, 4,5, 6,
7 and 8... .all met the
[BiEdrong] sand below the
level in No. 1,” and again
(p. 52) “Nine other holes have
been drilled on the same
structure, but all have encoun-
tered the oil-sand at a lower
elevation than the bottom of
the oil in the discovery-hole.”
As far as the top of the oil
is concerned, the first statement
may be correct, but the second
statement is in error with
reference to Rough Range 6,
which was a very significant
bore.
Equally questionable is the
statement (p. 56) that “the bore
[Rough Range 1] is on the
edge of the pool since the oil-
water contact was present in
the bore.” The oncoming of
water in this well may be due
to many factors of which that
favored in the report is one of
the least likely.
One of the authors believes
(p. 58) that “the main control
[throughout W.A.] is' the
original shape of the Pre-
cambrian surface on which the
sediments were deposited.” It
is gratifying to learn that at
least one geologist, in addition
to myself, recognises (by
implication) the divorcement
of post-Triassic from pre-
Triassic structures on the Aus-
tralian mainland.
Appendix 2 consists of a
peculiar division of wells into
“(A) Wells drilled in search for
oil,” and “(B) Bores drilled for
structural and stratigraphical
information.” Quite apart
from the unrealistic nature of
this division, some of the wells
appear in the wrong category.
Rough Range wells 4,5, 7 and
8, listed under (A), were
described as “structural” after
wells 2 and 3 had been prema-
turely described as “develop-
mental”; wells. 4 and 5 were
sunk in an attempt to resolve
two conflicting theories as to
the orientation of the Birdrong
anticlinal major axis. Why
should Dirk Hartog 17A be
differentiated from its offset
17B? Kaufana well, when
spudded - in, was definitely
placed under (A) by its spon-
sors ; its transfer to (B), after
it failed to strike anything
worth while, is quite unjustified.
In spite of these blemishes,
Report No. 41 is the most
instructive volume yet pro-
duced by the Bureau of
Mineral Resources. All inter-
ested in the search for black
gold in Australasia should
obtain a copy of the pamphlet.
It is free.
South Alligator Uranium
A TREATMENT-PLANT Using the
new solvent - extraction
process is now under con-
struction for South Alligator
Uranium, N.L., and the co.
hopes to begin production of
uranium-oxide in August 1959.
Under a contract with the
U.K. Atomic Energy
Authority, South Alligator
Uranium is to deliver uranium-
oxide to a value of £1,157,000
by early 1962. A bank-loan
of £160,000 and the recent final
call (6d. a share) are expected
to finance, the project up to a
“self-supporting stage.”
At September 30 last the co.
had a paid capital of £461,000,
of which £220,483 was repre-
sented by intangibles, £195,000
by the mine property at South
Alligator (N.T.), £41,684 by
fixed assets and £3833 by the
surplus of current assets over
liabilities. Payment of the
final call in the current term
has taken paid capital to
£495,000, in f.-p. ss. shares.
The sharemarket, doubtful of
the future demand for uranium-
oxide, prices the scrip at around
3s. lid.


MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
As 1958 closed, share-prices
in N.Z. were still drifting
downward.
Since the beginning of the
year average prices have de-
clined by about 12 per cent.
Half this fall was spread over
the first six months of the year.
By far the greater part of the
second half of the fall occurred
immediately after the presenta-
tion of the Budget on June 26.
A mild rally at the end of
August was not sustained.
Over the last few months' in-
creasing tightness in the money-
market has been making itself
felt.
As was to be expected, the
vulnerable low-yielding market-
leaders, notably breweries, in-
surances and chain-stores, have
been the chief sufferers.
Second-liners Wanted
There has been a good
demand for sound second-rank
shares, and many of these have
improved their position.
Nearly all the leaders are
now at their lowest point for
the year.
Dominion Breweries, which
reached an ex-rights peak of
925. 9d. in mid-February, are
down to 70s. (All prices in
N.Z. currency.)
New Zealand Breweries,
which sold at up to 555. 6d.
in June before the one-for-two
scrip issue, are down to 31s. 9d.
The holder of one share worth
555. 6d. in June, now, in effect,
holds one-and-a-half shares
worth a total of 475. 7d., a fall
of 7s. lid.
Both the big insurances have
followed an irregular down-
ward course throughout the
year, New Zealand from 84s.
to 70s. 6d., South British from
89s. to 70s.
McKenzies have fallen from
20s. 3d. in February to 16s. 6d.
Woolworths (N.Z.) have
dropped from 19s. in March to
15s. Bd.
K.P.N.Z. Drug have suffered
severely, falling from £5 2s. 9d.
early in the year to 725. 6d.

* Based on interim dividend rate.
Company figures this year
have, overall, been good, but
in the last few weeks there
has been a noticeable increase
in the number of reports of
profit-setbacks.
Directors of three companies,
which have just presented
interim half-yearly reports,
took a look at the future and
all tempered their optimism
with a generous mixture of
caution.
In almost identical terms
they said that, though the
economy was basically sound,
N.Z.'s difficulties were far from
being solved. The effects of
lower export prices and restric-
tive controls were likely to be
felt more sharply in the months
immediately ahead. A some-
what lower level of profitable
trading might be expected.
Ups and Downs
In the eleven months to the
end of November, 170 N.Z.
companies whose ordinary
shares are officially listed by
the Stock Exchange presented
their annual accounts.
Results may be summarised
as follows:
Profits: Up 130, down 40.
Ordinary dividends: Up 59, down
13, steady 98.
In the corresponding period
last year results (for 175 com-
panies) were:
Profits: Up 106, down 69.
Ordinary dividends: Up 42, down
18, steady 115.
A feature of the period since
the Budget has been the un-
usually large number of
dividend-increases. The opera-
tion of the new excess-profits
retention tax has been partly
responsible for this.
As an example, Black and
White Cabs is paying its first
dividend for more than 30
years.
Formed in 1926, this com-
pany quickly got into diffi-
culties. By 1949 there was a
debit of £58,216 in the p.-and.-l.
account, and the 20s. shares
were accepted for death-duty
purposes at 3d. each. Gradu-
ally, however, recovery was
made. By March 31 last the
debit balance was down to
£10,602. It was the directors’
stated intention to go on
ploughing-back profits till the
shares had an asset-backing of
20s. each. They were con-
fident that that would be
achieved within two years. The
excess-retention tax, however,
has upset their plans by forcing
payment of a dividend.
Retention Taxes
‘Holding-companies are in a
particularly awkward position,
and several of them are being
forced to adopt a rather com-
plicated procedure to protect
shareholders' interests.
Under the tax legislation,
holding companies must pay
excess-retention tax at 7s. in
the pound on any dividends
received from subsidiaries and
not distributed to shareholders.
In the year to March 31 last,
for instance, McKenzies (N.Z.)
received £154,215 in dividends
from subsidiaries, but paid out
to shareholders only £116,015.
To avoid tax of £13,370 on the
£38,200 retained, the company
now intends to distribute this
amount by way of a special
dividend, brought up to 5 per
cent, by the addition of £8206
from the p.-and-l. account. The
dividend will take the place of
this year’s interim dividend.
William Cable Holdings has
had to adopt a similar pro-
cedure.
The directors of John Duthie
holdings have pointed out that,
to avoid excess-retention tax,
it is necessary to discontinue the
practice of creating reserves
in the holding-company and
revert to the building of
reserves in subsidiaries.
There is general agreement
with them that the legislation
which makes this necessary is
“frustrating and unnecessarily
restrictive.”
Premium Funds
Since the Government
announced that exchange to
cover excess import-licences
would be made available offi-
cially not later than March
next, there has been a sharp
decline in the premium com-
manded by Australian shares
here, over and above the N.Z.
equivalent of the Australian
price.
Back in May, when importers
were desperately clamoring
for funds, the premium was up
to 14 per cent ; now it is down
to 6 per cent, or even lower.
Recent prices in Sydney
and N.Z. for the most popular
issues are:

Demand is beginning to pick-
up in the Government-stock
market.
Between September 25 and
November 20 final maturity
yields rose steeply. Twelve
different issues were showing a
return of 5 per cent, or better.
A reverse movement has now
begun.

Iron and Steel
The chairman of directors of
the New Zealand Development
Corporation, Mr. W. J. R.
Scollay, has returned after an
extensive overseas tour, fully
convinced N.Z. can have its
own iron-and-steel industry,
based on ironsands, within the
next few years.
Mr. Sco 11 a y consulted
numerous steel companies—
English, American, Continental
and Australian.
Detailed proposals for the
establishment of an iron-and-
steel industry based on the
use of ironsands have been
given Government by the cor-
poration.
The basic proposal is for an
annual production of between
100,000 and 150,000 tons of
selected mill products.
The minimum economic out-
put for N.Z. is put at 100,000
tons of mill products a year.
A full study by consultants
would be required before a firm
decision on tonnage could be
taken.
The corporation believes a
production figure of more than
120,000 tons a year could be
reached within three years.
This will be entirely inde-
pendent of the scrap-plant
which the Government has
given the Fletcher organisation
permission to establish in
Auckland, and it is understood
this production can be stepped
up as the demand rises.
Production would be limited
to a range of items such as
merchant-bars, wire and
blooming-mill products such as
rail, heavy rounds and similar
items. The overall cost is
estimated at well below £3O
million. It is believed that a
substantial proportion of the
finance required could be
obtained overseas.
The Dairy Industry
A six-man committee has
been appointed to inquire into
the problems of the dairy
industry.
Two representatives from
each of the Dairy Board, the
Dairy Commission and the
Dairy Industry Council will
comprise the committee.
Linked with an inquiry into
the financial structure of the
industry is reported to be a
strong move by some sections
for the industry to break away
from all Government control.
The operations of the
industry will also come in for
close scrutiny as well as
measures which can be taken
to maintain a proper balance
of production.

Sister-in-Law
By
E. A. SOLLSCHEWSKY
The sight of Miriam’s feet, in
their dirty, shapeless felt-
slippers, on the antique chair
made him feel ill.
During his wife’s last ill-
ness Edmund Rushe
was hardly aware of his
sister-in-law’s presence
in the house. Bewildered by
the knowledge that the woman
who had indulgently dominated
him for 15 years was abandon-
ing him with a finality there
was no gainsaying, he scarcely
realised Miriam had entered
his life.
She didn’t intrude. He slept
on the settee in his wife’s room
in order to tend her wants
through the night. He ate from
trays which appeared regularly
on the hall-table outside the
sick-room. He read thermo-
meters, mixed medicine,
changed bed-linen. He' had
loved his wife. He could have
told you anything about her,
even to the tiniest detail—like
how her toes turned backward
under pressure from bunions ;
her favorite color; the color
of her eyes and the flowers
she liked best. There was
nothing he didn't know about
her, having studied her long
through the observant eye of
love.
It was different with Miriam.
He became aware of her as a
person for the first time several
days after the funeral. Until
then, he couldn’t have said
what she looked like, what kind
of clothes she wore, what her
conversation consisted of.
When his wife was alive he'd
met her only once, and in his
wife's family talk she had
always figured merely as “My
sister Miriam,” a creature with-
out personality, interest, vice
or virtue.
For two weeks now she had
lived in his house, only another
shadow in a world of grey
gloom and sadness. But he
looked at her at last.
He saw a woman older than
Stella had been, taller, stouter.
Stella had been brisk, efficient,
immensely practical, but her
eyes were kind and her mouth
warm. This square, flat face
across the breakfast-table had
a curiously nebulous look to his
grief-fogged gaze. There wasn’t,
he thought, any definable
expression in it at all. It was
neither handsome nor plain,
clever nor stupid, young nor
old. Just a floating kind of
face, without substance, like a
reflection in the clear brown
waters of a tea-tree swamp.
He cleared his throat.
“I er never eat Lard-
boiled eggs, Miriam. I’m
awfully sorry, since you’ve
taken the trouble to cook them
so nicely, but I just can’t.
Never could.”
“But you’ve eaten them every
morning since I’ve been here.”
She didn’t look surprised or
put out at all, but sensibly
continued with the job of
polishing to a pearly gloss the
inside of her own scooped-out
eggshell.
“Have I?” A shade of sad-
ness crossed his neat features as
he remembered the darkness
through which he’d ultimately
found his way. Then he sighed,
and unobtrusively pushed his
plate aside. Ah, Stella! She
would have sprung up at once
with one of her laughing gibes
about “fads and fancies.” Not
that she would have dreamed of
serving him anything he didn’t
care for. Life was going to be
more complex, he saw, without
Stella’s firmly protecting devo-
tion.
Still, there was toast and
marmalade. He made a meagre
meal on this, while Miriam
placidly chopped the head olf
her second hard-boiled egg.
The sight of that small, uncar-
ing action somehow accen-
tuated his sense of loss and lit
a hidden hatred, a tamped-
down passion of innate dislike,
the first he had experienced.
For Edmund was a gentle
man; exactly that.
T eaving for the tiny, obscure,
dusty little shop where he
had always been completely
happy selling enough books to
return him a reasonable living,
he turned back to Miriam.
“Is there anything I can bring
you from town? I used to do
Stella's marketing often,
especially the heavy items, and
bring them home in the car.”


Miriam actually beamed.
“Well, that’s very kind of you,
I must say. But I don't think
—there’s so much I doubt if 1
could remember it all off-hand.
Bacon, I know, and potatoes
‘'lf you make a list I can
do the shopping at lunchtime.
I close from noon till two, so
it's no trouble.”
“Actually, I was wondering
how I'd manage. The baskets
are much too heavy for me to
hump up that frightful hill
from the tramstop. But 1 don't
know—l can’t really think so
early, and sort of unexpec-
tedly.” She wavered, then
brightened while he struggled
to understand what unexpected
thought meant. “Edmund, it
might be better if you left the
car for me to drive down to
the shops. One or two days
a week, only. All the other
men around here use the train ;
it's very good, they tell me.
I’ve spoken to Mr. Kidd, Mr.
Perrett and Mr. Smith, and
they all go into the city by
train.” She ended on a little
note of pleased triumph, like a
clever child.
“Well—l—” He'd always
loathed trains. How to explain
that to this uncomprehending
swimming face before him?
All his life he’d had his own
conveyance, and it had become
a matter of urgent necessity to
him that he continued to do so.
Stella had understood. “Like
my expensive shoes,” she had
smiled. “I had to wear such
uncomfortable things when I
was a child, always worn for
years by somebody else first so
that they never did conform to
the shape of my feet, and
raised bumps all over. Now
•shoes are my only extrava-
gance.”
He couldn’t bear the close
atmosphere of carriages, nor
the smoke-filled air, the push-
ing, odorous proximity of
humanity, the need for punc-
tuality. Though for one day,
surely, he could put-up with it,
he chided himself. “Today?”
he blurted reluctantly.
“Oh, dear me, Edmund, not
necessarily. Tomorrow, or the
next day . . .” Her nod seemed
very much like dismissal. But,
he told himself, that was
absurd. How could she dismiss
him in his own home?
His morning was spoiled. He
was aware of something gone
wrong in the pleasant routine
of his days. There was his
wife's death, of course, but it
wasn’t that which caused him
this unease.
Miriam, he reflected, seemed
to be completely recovered
from the ordeal of losing her
only sister. Recovered? What
had her sorrow been like? He
couldn’t remember. He'd never
even noticed her. She would,
he supposed, be returning to
her own home any day now.
The next morning he broke
the shell of his breakfast egg,
and stared at it in disbelief.
The yoke was powdery, pale-
yellow in the centre but tinged
with an outer circle of bluish-
green where it curved into the
marble of a grossly over-
cooked white.
Miriam had forgotten what
he'd said about boiled eggs!
It must hurt her feelings if he
reminded her. She'd be over-
whelmed by self-reproach.
Surreptitiously he helped
himself once more to toast and
marmalade, at the same time
chagrined to find that she went
calmly about the demolishing
of her own pair of eggs, plainly
relishing the leathery horrors.
His morning paper was
propped before her. Edmund
had always courteously offered
his paper to a visitor before
opening it himself, but he’d
never had a chance to offer
it to Miriam. She had simply
annexed it.
The coffee was weak and
lukewarm.
“I’ll make the coffee of a
morning if you like,” he offered
pleasantly. “I prefer mine very
strong.”
“But that’s bad for you ! No,
indeed, I'll see to it, then we
won’t be poisoned by whatever
it is in strong coffee which
poisons.”
“Nonsense, Miriam. Coffee
isn't poisonous at all. All my
life”
With a careless gesture she
flopped the pages of the paper
together in a rough jumble,
and passed it to him. “Here,
read it in the train going to
town. It'll make the journey
all the shorter. No, Edmund,
I promised Stella I’d look after
you, and I'd be doing less than
my duty if I allowed you to
poison yourself with caffein.
Besides” —she gave him a
sudden smile as vague and dis-
tracted as her eyes were —“I
like it weak, old boy. Very
weak.”
She laughed, perhaps expec-
ting him to join in with her.
When he failed to do so, she
remained unruffled.
“You have, Edmund, just
ten minutes to catch your
train.”
She had glanced casually at
her watch. He found himself
rising obediently.
TJerplexed. he sat in the train
between a fat schoolboy
who chomped noisily through
strong-smelling liquorice-straps
and a thin woman whose
pointed hips pressed his side
with a kind of revolting inti-
macy, the paper unopened
upon his knees. Surely, he
thought, Stella had exacted no
promise from Miriam to look
after him? Only a few days
before her death she'd said:
“Edmund, darling, you won't be
too lonely. All our neighbors
in Banksia House are nice
people—they'll be your friends.
And who knows? You're not
really old at all —just so prim.
Marry again if you get the
chance. Grab it with both
hands.”
Nothing said about Miriam.
In fact, now he searched his
memory, he could plainly recall
Stella's reaction when Miriam
arrived, uninvited, to look
after her sister's household.
Stella had been nonplussed
and irritable, insisting that
Miriam s h o u 1 d n't have
bothered ; and Edmund had
blindly taken her protests as
an excess of gratitude! Look-
ing back, he realised that Stella
had never wanted her sister
near her.
He hadn't understood! For
the first time, in all his married
life, Edmund felt the agony of
self-reproach. Stella had been
ill, and he hadn't properly
protected her.
Protected her from what?
Dazedly, he wiped his hand
across his forehead. He must
be losing his mind. Miriam was
a good woman. She had made
that long journey solely to be
near her dying sister. But . . .
long journey from where?
He didn't even know where
she came from ; what her back-
ground was. She had no sub-
stance of personal history. She
was an infiltrating fog ...
Stella must have given her
sister a watch exactly like her
own. Even Miriam wouldn't
dare disturb that closed room,
where all Stella’s belongings
remained exactly as she'd left
them. Not yet. Nobody would
dare . . .
The thin woman’s bony
thigh prodded him sharply as
the train swerved, and he drew
back in open recoil. The
woman smiled.
That evening, after a dinner
at which Edmund realised for
the first time what an indiffer-
ent cook Miriam really was.
and what unappetising food
she slapped-out, he went in to
Stella’s room.
The watch was missing.
Miriam was reading a lurid
magazine, her feet resting on a
small brpeaded chair which
should never have been
removed from the sitting-room.
The kitchen fire blazed high,
and the air was hot, rancid
with stale cooking-odors. The
sight of M i r i a m's small,
pigeon-toed feet, in their dirty,
shapeless felt-slippers, on the
fragile beauty of the antique
chair made him feel ill. Sweat
broke out in cold beads upon
his upper lip, his forehead, his
back.
“Miriam, I've been looking
for Stella’s watch. I can't find
it. ' Never had he spoken so
brusquely to anybody in his
life. Any “speaking-to” that
had been necessary, Stella had
always seen to. When the
butcher delivered tough meat,
when the people next-door
kept their party going too long
and riotiouslv, when the owner
of Banksia House failed to
attend to a leak in the cistern, it
was Stella who '‘spoke about it."
Miriam looked surprised.
“Why, Edmund, of course I've
been wearing it. Watches
deteriorate if they're not used
and wound regularly.” Her
eyes filled. “I couldn't bear
to have Stella’s lovely watch
just rust away . . . unused . . .”
He swallowed. She was
right, in a way. But she was
also very wrong not to con-
sult him first. Under the trim
grey moustache his softly
curved, gentle mouth opened.
She must be told, now . . .
She added, sadly, “I wear it
for my dear sister’s sake. In
memory of Stella.”
“Well—h’m —yes, I suppose
so.” He felt dismal, depressed,
his purpose blunted.
Unaware how completely his
appearance bore out this inner
sense of defeat, he could only
stand there, ineptly fingering
the buttons of his coat and
blinking weak tears from his
eyes. His narrow, clerical
shoulders sagged under the
grey linen shirt he wore. He'd
lost weight, and his grey
slacks were loose at his hips.
Empty and grey, he felt. If he
were alone he knew he’d be
able to tackle the job of recon-
structing his life. It was
Miriam's presence which
oppressed and confused him.
“H'mm! Well, then. I've
been wondering, Miriam, what
your family are doing without
you. They must miss you
dreadfully.”
The words were mockery—
nobody could possibly miss
Miriam, this unsubstantial
shadow of a woman.
“I have no family, Edmund.”
She bent her head. “Only you.”
He started, eyes jumping
nervously. “Oh, I'm no rela-
tion. Can’t count me. Prac-
tically a stranger.”
“Stella’s husband. My
brother at heart.”
“Oh, not at all. Too kind—
h'mm! Miriam, you mustn't


feel bound to stay here looking
after me. I’m wonderful at
batching. Really. You must
feel entirely free to return to
your home at any time —now,
if you wish —yet the very
moment you desire to”
“l have no home, Edmund.
Only this one.”
His inherent good manners
dropped away like a veil-
dancer’s last wisps of chiffon.
“But you must have come from
somewhere! ” he cried ungal-
lantly.
“A room. Furnished. Upper
back. Never lived in one, have
you, Edmund? I assure you,
it would try your refinement.
I gave it up when I came here
to nurse poor Stella.”
“But I had a day-nurse, and
I looked after her by night.
There was no need . . .” he
stopped, lost, without the sign-
posts of courtesy.
“I looked after the whole
household. Kept it running on
oiled wheels, you might say.
Have you forgotten already,
Edmund?”
“Of course not, Miriam. I
only wondered ... I don’t want
you to feel under any obliga-
tion to stay on. I’m a good
cook; Stella sometimes liked
me to cook our meals. And
I have good neighbors. When
you leave I’ll get along
famously.”
“Yes, I’m sure you will.
After all, you’re a man.”
Her smile was as vague as
her general outline, but he
sensed the insult. It purred in
her furry voice, devious and
intangible.
"Dy the end of the second
week, tired of peering
about for the signs of depar-
ture which never made their
appearance, Edmund was con-
vinced she didn’t intend to go.
It was impossible. But it was
also the macabre truth. He
couldn’t shift his unwelcome
guest.
Worst of all, he knew he was
losing his sense of humor.
Without that, how did one
survive disaster? Jokes about
mothers-in-law coming to stay,
about boarders usurping first
place in the household, even
humor on the subject of old-
failed to make
him smile. Like a man with
toothache, he saw no humor in
a dentist’s-chair joke.
Miriam did not say, ever,
that she had come to stay. But
each day saw her a little further
embedded in his life, more
safely ensconced as house-
keeper and relative, less defer-
ential to his comfort and more
demanding of her own rights.
Edm u n d’s rights had
dwindled alarmingly. H e
travelled to town every day by
train now; Miriam liked to
eat-out at restaurants, and on
these nights she invariably
booked seats for a revue show
afterwards. She disliked serious
plays, classical music and all
films except musicals, so that
the frequent outings were pur-
gatory to him.
When he unexpectedly took
a friend home for dinner
Miriam burst into tears in front
of the man. She had only two
veal-cutlets for dinner, she
didn’t feel up to company —
she’d been ill all day—Edmund
should have warned her ... it
was her right . . .
Scarlet with embarrassment,
Edmund had hustled his old
friend away to a nearby cafe.
Friend? Scarcely that. Edmund
and Stella had been so much all
in all to each other that they
had gathered no intimates
around them. But he’d known
Bill for years.
“How,” he asked over the
soup, “do you get rid of some-
body you don’t want around?
A visitor.”
“Arsenic, old boy.”
Bill laughed, but shot him.a
shrewd look.
“No, seriously. It's some-
thing I’ve never had to do
before.”
“I’d simply tell the leech to
get. And see that she got.”
“Yes, I suppose you would.”
Edmund sighed. Bill was a
partner in a butchery. A good
chap, but there it was.
Butchers knew how to deal with
everything. He, unfortunately,
was a bookseller.
Never again did he invite
anybody home for a meal with-
out first consulting Miriam,
which meant he never did have
another guest to dinner, for
she invariably produced a
sound reason why another
night would be better. He lost
contact with his friends, and
found to his dismay that more
and more her own circle tended
to make free use of the flat.
And among them was not a
single person he could tolerate.
A stiff-necked, bigoted lot,
they were ; comprising some
obscure religious cult, they
filled his home with a fustiness
and hypocrisy which made him
physically ill.
Would she never go?
In desperation he spoke to
the Perretts about it. They
were his immediate neighbors,
ground-floor back. Of the three
other families housed by
Banksia House, Stella and
Edmund had rather favored the
Perretts, while never becoming
too involved even with them.
They never thought it wise to be
too thick with neighbors.
So Edmund was amazed to
discover that they knew
Miriam well; indeed, much
better than they had known
Stella or himself.
“She seems a wonderful
person,” Flo Perrett said rather
coolly, after he had backed
up to and away from the sub-
ject of Miriam before he finally
managed to broach it. “All
that church work she does, and
never asking a penny for her-
self. Nor anything.”
Edmund stared at her
uncomprehendingly.
“Well, you don’t pay her
anything, do you?” she
demanded with impatience.
“Why should I?” Edmund
was astounded. “I don’t want
her there. I want her to go
back where she came from.”
“She gave that up when she
came to your rescue. You
don’t seem to have any idea of
what that woman does for
you.”
“Oh, you’re wrong, I assure
you. She does nothing. The
flat is a shambles—it’s never
been so dirty and neglected.
The food is uneatable. She
listens to radio-serials, has her
friends in, reads love-stories —
she has the dullest kind of
mind . . .”
Flo Perrett laughed, not very
prettily. “Like all men, you
don’t understand how a woman
slaves all day for your comfort.
A woman’s work is never done.
No unions, no closing-hours,
no occupational - hazard
money. And when you think
of the risks involved in child-
birth”—
“That question hardly
arises.”
“in your case, no. But I
must say, Edmund, you’re not
“I don't think I have room for your father."
very appreciative. Still,
Miriam doesn’t entirely blame
you. She says you’ve never
been the same man since your
wife died.”
He was fighting a fog, of
course. Miriam was a fog
which penetrated to the
farthest corner of his life, and
the more he struggled against
it the closer it clung.
"TVesperation and fear drove
him, at length, into asking
her to go. When the words
were out he heard his own
breath in the shocked silence
which followed. A panting,
harassed breathing . . .
The surprise died out of her
eyes, leaving them as vague as
ever. With a stab of sick
acceptance he saw she was
wearing one of Stella’s favorite
dresses, though it was too tight.
Her legs stuck out from the
hem like sticks. How could
such a fat woman have such
thin legs and small, turned-in,
bird’s feet?
“Very well, Edmund.”
It was, of course, too easy.
He knew from that moment
she had no intention of leav-
ing, or she would have fought.
He never knew when she
moved from her smaller,
plainer room into Stella’s. She
was always up when he rose
in the mornings, and after he
retired at night he could hear
her in the bathroom for a long
time. She sang while she
bathed, using a heavily-scented
soap he detested ; scattered
talcum over furniture and
floor ; left her soiled clothing
in a heap behind the door.
She was gross.

new motor-car as a gift in
the morning, and then you
took it back in the afternoon.
As I couldn’t have a motor-
car, I took a shipil’
The explosion was terrific.
A dam had a penchant for
hansom-cabs when he re-
quired a mental vacation by
way of a pub-crawl. Once,
during the upsetting Mclntosh
regime, he waited upon the
driver of a rather four-
cornered white horse “to drive
me to Bourke.”
The cab-driver was an old
friend. Knowing it would be
easier, and much more lucra-
tive to humor Adam, he said:
“I can’t go to Bourke without
leaving some dough - ray -me
with the old woman.”
Adam supported this high
motive. They drove to Surry
Hills, and Adam gave the
cabby’s wife some finance to
carry-over the period of their
drive to Bourke.
“I have consulted with the
horse,” said Adam to the
driver, “and he considers that
it will be a delight to get away
from the hardness of the
cobblestones, gaze upon the
farinaceous fields, and discuss
with bucolic bipeds Pegasu-
sian Hippocrene.”
To which the cab-driver
“My oath”-ed.
Each side of the “road to
Bourke” was lined with pubs.
To the driver, perched high
on his seat of the hansom-cab,
the pubs were as close as the
pickets in a fence, with Adam
a fence-inspector who had to
carefully scrutinise every
picket for possible flaws. The
energy expended in getting up
and down to his high seat
finally induced the driver to
accept the invitation of. his
client to enter the cab and
drive the horse from there.
This upset the balance of the
vehicle, and the four-cornered
white horse curled a lip when
the weight descended.
Late that night they had
completed some 20 miles of
the 400-and-some on “the road
to Bourke.” The horse was
taken out of the shafts, and his
tucker-bag put on him under
a tree in front of a hostelry.
Adam and the driver put on
their feeding-bags, and then
retired to their rooms on the
first-floor.
Later Adam awakened to
see that it was raining, thought
of the poor horse in the open,
went downstairs and brought
the docile sleep-walker up-
stairs, and placed it in the
driver's room. He did it as an
animal-lover. Later the sky
cleared, a great moon shone
through the bedroom window
onto the white horse, the driver
awakened, and, believing that
he was seeing the spectre of
his horse in that room up two
flights of stairs, let out a
blood-curdling yell.
The pub was awakened.
You can take a horse up-
stairs, but try to lead an un-
trained horse downstairs!
With a bag over his head, the
poor white horse was eventu-
ally gotten to his correct level
on earth. And, as the publican
had decided that the wear-
and-tear on his nerves was not
worth Adam’s custom, the
cabby asked : “Well, will we get
on the road to Bourke, Mr.
McCay?”
“Who said we were going to
Bourke?” said Adam. “I
told you to drive me to
Brighton! ”
'T'here are many amusing
anecdotes of Adam Mc-
Cay, and of Fred J. Broom-
field, Bulletin writer of long
ago, and his charming French
wife Alice, called by all and
sundry “Marane.” Adam
married their daughter
Maideau, who inherited the
pretty French lisp of her
mother.
Some years ago Fred J. and
his wife were entertaining a
number of writers, poets and
artists on, a special wedding-
anniversary. Among the guests
were Rod Quinn, J. H. M.
Abbott, and a whole lot of
others who can now frequent
only Memory's Bar. The night
had gone forward to beyond
the time when Rod Quinn had
become sentimental in verse,
Fred J. Broomfield had used his
basso profundo to kill opposi-
tion to his delivery of
his beliefs on all matters apper-
taining to this world, and most
people had had their say, when
someone piped-up and sug-
gested that “Marane’’ Broom-
field should tell what she
thought about 50 years of
marriage to Fred J.
Despite the vicissitudes
naturally associated with being
married to a writer, who not
only spoke his generally un-
popular beliefs but bawled
them in his stentorian voice,
Alice Broomfield treasured “my
Fweddie” and was like a mother
with a lot of wayward chicks
to all the bohemians who came
to her place. But she still
possessed a kindly feeling
towards the failings of
humanity. Being slightly deaf,
she would excuse Fred’s loud
voice by saying: “It is my
ear, you know, which makes
his voice so loud,” and those
who did not know her well
would take her literally.
“Yes, yes, Marane! Marane!
Marane! It is your turn to
tell us what you think of half-
a-century of marriage!”
M'arane rose up, adjusted her
hearing-aid in the slightly self-
conscious manner she had, and,
gesturing to Fred J., said: “All
I can say—after fifty years of
marriage to Fred J. Broomfield
—is that he has made me deaf
listening to his stories of castles
in Spain! ”
Garrulous Fred was silent a
moment; then he looked over
his glasses and laughed with
the rest of them, while Marane
kissed his white locks.
A few years later we had
taken'Fred J. on his last
journey. On the way back
from the funeral we called in at
a hotel to give the traditional
toast of bon voyage! to the
departed.
“How many mugs of beer
do we want?” asked Adam
McCay.
“Eleven,” says I.
“Twelve,” says Adam, taking
a pot of beer and pouring it
into the gutter outside:
“There’s one for the gutter,
Fred,” he said.
And back in the pub all the
dead came to life as we talked
of them. Cecil Hartt, Harry
Julius, Roy Evans, “Drift,”
and others, and, as with the
traditional wake, the talk came
back to Broomfield, the most
recent to hurry away to that
most impudent and insistent
call of Death.
“Ah,” said Adam, “before
Fred broke his leg and age
wilted him he was D’Artagnan
from the pages of Dumas.
Astonishingly handsome, with
an impeccable beard and the
march of a gladiator, he was
worth seeing. And full of
childlike confidences like Don
Quixote. I remember him
striding up Pitt Street near
the old ‘Sydney Morning
Herald' offices. There was an
old journalist named Thomp-
son standing by a post with
a dour look on his face when
Fred came bouncing along,'
using his walking-stick as a
sword, which he would thrust
into his hand as though it
was a sheath: ‘Joy with me
today!’ he roared. ‘For a new
heir has been born to the house
of Broomfield!’
“Thompson-of-the-liver was
unimpressed, so, to press his
point, Fred gave him a
resounding whack on the back
and reiterated ‘Joy with me!’
And the sick man, to show his
joy, vented his wrath on Fred
and laid him flat in the gutter.
“When remonstrated with,
Thompson said: ‘And why
shouldn’t I hit him? Here
comes a man dancing with his
joy of being alive and having
repeated himself with the co-
operation of his wife, and here
am I dying with a liver up to
my neck, and you wonder why
I hit him!’”
A dam went on to say that
that did not finish the
exuberant Fred J. Broomfield.
He forgave the world its
jealousy of his happiness, and
went further up Pitt Street, call-
ing upon the day to joy with
him. Drawing his sword again
and again as he went up King
Street, he shouted that not only
the land of the Southern Cross
but all the world should joy
with him on the arrival of his
son, Lionel.
Entering the old Britannia
tavern he drew his sword and
brought it down with a
resounding whack on the top
of the bar as he cried to the
husky male chucker-out behind:
“Varlet! • Fetch me a stoup of
mead!”
Being one of the ignorant
masses, the publican’s strong
arm misinterpreted the archaic
“Varlet” and removed Fred
from participation in Sydney
events for the next half-hour.
And Fred, being at heart a boy
living a couple of centuries
earlier, was not dismayed with
the day's events, and later told
a tale of being attacked by
10 men in Kendal-green, and
vanquishing all.
“There's one for the gutter,
Fred, you’ve fought your last
imaginary host, and your going
takes a little of me with you.”
A different type of ghost in
Memory’s Bar is Eric Han-
man, artist and writer, who
died during the World’s Second
Madness, and who used to tell
the story of his arrival in Aus-
tralia.
“My pater,” Eric would say,
adopting the exaggerated Eng-
lish diction with which he had
arrived, “was an Army man.

That's Another One Gone
IN reviewing the events of a closing
year it used to be enough to survey
happenings from the four corners of
the earth, but that is no longer
adequate. For that reason this survey
of 1958 begins with a backward (and
upward) glance at the behavior of man-
made intruders in Space.
When 1958 opened Sputnik I was
nearing the end of its career. It burnt
itself out on re-entering the atmosphere
on January 4, having made 1367 circuits
of the globe on its somewhat monotonous
journey of 43-million miles. Sputnik 11,
a half-tonner with Laika the space-dog
aboard, was still hurtling merrily along,
destined to girdle the earth 2370 times
and travel 62-million miles before disin-
tegrating on April 14. By that time the
United States, after several failures, had
succeeded in putting three satellites into
orbit, but they were mere pups and pea-
nuts compared with the sputniks.
By the year’s end the Yanks seemed to
have caught up. On December 18 their
rocketeers put up Atlas I, the biggest and
brightest yet, a four-ton satellite which,
on request, repeated back a Christmas
message which President Eisenhower had
tape-recorded for it before the launching.
A day later Atlas I showed itself capable
of receiving and sending back messages
flashed to it in orbit, a performance which
baffles the lay mind but brings great
satisfaction to military and civilian scien-
tists alike. English-speaking people
everywhere may be excused for feeling a
glow of pride at the thought that the
first voice ever to hail the earth from a
circling satellite spoke the tongue that
Shakspeare snake—even though 350
years, a trans-Atlantic climate, electronic
eccentricities and other factors unknown
to W.S. hsd played a few tricks with the
vowel-sounds.
A Friendship Fades
T\own here on earth the political condi-
tions which provided the impetus
for all this space-exploration remained
basically unchanged throughout the year,
with tension alternately tightening and
loosening at the whim of the wirepullers
of the Kremlin. The happy friendship of
B. and K. came to an end early in the
year. In January Marshal Bulganin was
still Prime Minister of the Soviet Union,
busily engaged in writing threatening
letters to the few remaining European
countries he had not already so honored.
By March he had been demoted to
chairman of the State Bank and by
August was chairman of the Stavropol
Economic Council, somewhere in the
Caucasus. Stavropol is about 800 miles
from Moscow, but that wasn’t far enough
to save the former Prime Minister from
further degradation. Just before Christ-
mas he was humbling himself before the
central committee of the Communist
party, abjectly “confessing” his “anti-
party crimes” and combing the Soviet
lexicon of vituperation for terms vile
enough to describe his comrades-in-
disgrace Malenkov, Molotov, Kagano-
vich and Shepilov.
Russia’s policy of negotiation by
threats lost nothing through the eclipse of
Mr. B. Mr. K. continued telling everyone
who would listen how much Russia loved
the world and how much it loved peace
and how it was prepared at any moment
to bash on the nose with an H-bomb any-
one who dared to doubt it. Negotiations
for the banning of nuclear tests, which
had been going on when the year began,
were still going on when it closed. Per-
haps the most the world in its present
state can hope of these negotiations is
that they will continue to go on for many
years to come.
Revolutions and Threats
'T'he year saw trouble-spots aplenty.
-*■ Military coups overthrew Govern-
ments in Siam, Pakistan, Sudan and
Iraq. In the first three countries rebel-
lions were bloodless, but in Iraq the
insurgents murdered King Faisal, the
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Nuri
es-Said. Threats of similar risings
brought British troops to Jordan and
U.S. troops to Lebanon at the request
of the rulers of those two countries and
to the great moral indignation of Russia.
The troops were withdrawn after con-
ditions had quietened down. In August,
Communist Chinese guns began bom-
barding Quemoy and Matsu, offshore
islands under Nationalist control, and to
the accompaniment of this martial music
Mao Tse-tung and Khrushchev addressed
discordant duets to Chiang Kai-shek and
Eisenhower demanding, in turn, the
evacuation of the islands, the surrender
of Formosa and the withdrawal of the
U.S. 7th Fleet from the area. When
America called the bluff Secretary for
State Foster Dulles was accused of
“brinkmanship,” but his judgment proved
sounder than that of his faint-heart
critics. Things are now almost quiet in
the Matsu region, and both Mao and
Chiang are talking of retiring. The
centre of irritation has shifted to Berlin,
but here again the bullying and bluster
and threats of a Third World War with
annihilation for everyone except the
friends of Russia have receded in the
face of a determined stand by the Nato
Powers. Khrushchev is still able to make
flesh creep, but his capacity for making
national leaders crawl is diminishing.
In Britain the year opened inauspici-
ously with the resignation of Chancellor
of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft; it
closed with the stocks of both the country
and the Government appreciably higher,
due largely to the increased personal
prestige of Prime Minister Macmillan
who, most unexpectedly, proved to be
a TV and platform success. Macmillan
visited Australia at the beginning of the
year—the first British Prime Minister to
do so while in office. In December
Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker
established a similar “first.” Earlier in
the year Diefenbaker had won a resound-
ing victory at the Canadian general elec-
tion, his Conservative party gaining a
record majority of 153.
No such good fortune attended Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s Republican party. At
the U.S. Congressional elections in
November the Democrats won both
Houses, facing Ike with the bleak fact
that however much his countrymen may
like him he will have to go down in
history as the President with the longest
experience of a hostile Congress.
For Europe 1958 was the year of the
establishment of the European Common
Market, with France resisting British per-
suasion to turn it into a wider Free Trade
Area (with reservations). For France
itself it was the year of the resurgence
of de Gaulle —first as Arbiter of the
Constitution, then as Prime Minister and,
as the year died, President-elect.
Nearer Home
In Australian Federal politics the year
_ saw the defeat of the Government’s
banking legislation in the Senate through
the temporary (very temporary) alliance
of the A.L.P., D.L.P. and Q.L.P.; the
retirement of Treasurer Artie Fadden,
Defence Minister Mcßride and (from
office only) Attorney-General O’Sullivan.
It also saw a general election, with the
failure of Dr. Evalt’s fantastic attempt to
win back D.L.P. supporters to the one
true Labor faith and the return of the
Menzies Government with an increased
(and record) majority.
Victorian Premier Bolte also increased
his majority in the House of Assembly
at a State election and gained seats at a
Legislative Council election —though not
enough to save two of his bills from
defeat in that House just before the
Christmas adjournment. Tasmanian
Premier Cosgrove retired through ill-
health towards the end of the year and
was succeeded by E. E. Reece. Premiers
in three other States —N. S. Wales, S.A.
and W.A. —were preparing for an elec-
tion as the year closed. Playford and
Hawke were facing the prospect fairly
calmly, but Cahill, having almost run out
of sops-for-voters, managed to squeeze
his semi-equal-pay and annual-leave bills
through the Macquarie Street talking-
shop, along with his unasked-for and
much-defamed Defamation Bill.
This last measure affects to some degree
the conclusion of this article. Looked at
appraisingly, 1958 has been much as
other years—good in parts, bad in parts.
It dies tonight, so it will be safer to
remember only its good points. Other-
wise its son and heir, 1959, feeling him-
self injuriously affected at the very
beginning of his career, may bring an
action for defamation of the dead.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Horses
Main reason for Huntly,
surprise winner of Tattersall’s
Carrington Stakes at Rand-
wick, going, out at 10 to 1
was because most racegoers
thought six furlongs too short
for the four-year-old stallion,
who raced in blinkers and was
last of the field at the half-
mile. Huntly had been de-
feated into third place at a
mile in the A.J.C. Villiers
Stakes a week earlier, after
being in the middle of the field
at the top of the straight. He
came back from eight furlongs
to six within a week to win
the Carrington brilliantly in
the fast time of 1.11. Huntly
had finished second to Turkes-
tan in the Epsom Handicap at
one mile, followed by similar
placings at six furlongs at
Canterbury Park and at seven
at Rosehill. In the Carrington
he defeated Royal Kingdom
and Merger. The favorite,
Amneris, ran a poor race.
Improving sharply on her
run of a week earlier, Wood-
lands Wonder easily won
Tattersall’s two - year - old
Maiden for fillies in the smart
time of 60 3 / lOsec. At her
previous outing she was a rank
outsider. Owner D. Macfar-
lane paid 2350gns. for the
Newtown Wonder (imp.)-
Silver Words filly at the Rand-
wick yearling-sales last April.
A product of Woodlands Stud,
Denman, the filly is well
credentialled, as she is a sister
to Apple Bay (Doomben Ten
Thousand, A.J.C. Challenge
Stakes, V.R.C. Lightning
Stakes, etc.), Apple Jack
(V.R.C. Maribyrnong Plate)
and to Mighty Flight, a Can-
terbury Park winner. Silver
Words is by Talking from
Silver Wave by Silverado
(imp.) from Bravery by Valais
(imp.). Bravery won races to
H mile.

Channel Swell (imp.) has
sired the winners of about
£145,000 in stakes, but his im-
posing list of successful horses
doesn’t include many stayers.
There are a few middle-
distance performers in the list
of this Kia-Ora stallion, now
deceased—among them Chan-
nel Rise (A.J.C. Derby), Sir
Coral (Queen’s Cup) and Tos-
sing (Doomben Cup). Latest
addition, Compass, had his
first success at a mile-and-a-
half when he defeated Bronze
Mac and Marksman in the
A.J.C. Summer Cup in the
moderate time of 2.32 1/10.
It was the four-year-old’s
seventh win, four from his
last five starts.
Compass is Sydney’s latest
staying find. He is to be set
for important long-distance
events at the Brisbane mid-
winter carnival next year after
having a well-earned spell.
Maybe Compass, who was sold
cheaply as a yearling for
375gn5., gets his staying power
from his dam Midsuma by
Midstream (imp.) from Tsuma
by Spearhead (imp.), a grand-
son of Carbine. Advocate
(Victoria Derby) is in the
Compass family. He was a
top stayer.
Lionel Israel, of Segenhoe
Stud, Scone, is one of those
lucky breeders of thorough-
breds who have a happy knack
of retaining for racing fillies of
their own breeding and win-
ning with them. Latest of his
winners, Akimbo, by Pan II
(Fr.), having her second start,
won the A.J.C.’s First Juvenile
Maiden Handicap in smart
style, even though the margin
was half-a-head only. Posture,
dam of Akimbo, was not
raced, but she has thrown a
number of winners, among
them Count Olin and The
Corsican, two smart sprinters.
The Corsican, a top performer
now in Brisbane, won a Rand-
wick Welter with lOst.
New Zealand’s £5OOO Great
Northern Derby was won by
Lawful in a close finish from
Fountain Head and Beau Way.
Lightly-fancied Lawful was
ridden by former Victorian
jockey W. A. Smith, who on
the same afternoon won the
£2500 Railway Handicap, six
furlongs, on Yahabeebee, who
proved a disappointment in
Australia. She carried 9.7 to
easy victory from two light-
weights, Lion and Fitnah.

The A.J.C. Apprentices’
School has been in operation
for 25 years. Its enthusiastic
controllers have been of great
help to the hundreds of young
horsemen who have passed
through their hands. This year
64 lads have attended regu-
larly, and most of them were
at the annual prize-giving
night at the Randwick race-
course. Ray Patterson, 18,
apprenticed to Randwick
trainer M. McCarten, and who
is dux of the school for 1958,
received the Perkins Cup and
the Wootton saddle. Runner-
up S. Farrawell, who is
attached to Frank Dalton’s
Randwick stable, won the
Potter-Mackay saddle. Other
winners included W. Nock, K.
Parkinson and D. Allen. A
feature of the night was the
showing of a film of the
various activities of the school.

N.Z. owner M. J. Moodabe,
a noted patron of Australian
racing—his horses have won
many thousands in stakes in
this country—held a mortgage
on the Denman Handicap
run over a mile-and-a-quarter
at Tattersall’s meeting at Rand-
wick. In a field reduced to six
starters he held the whip-hand
with equal favorites Lord
Cortauld and Jack’s Count, and
they finished in that order
with pacemaker Bystander
third. It is rarely that horses
racing in same ownership
start equal favorites and fill the
first two places. Jack’s Count
had to concede his rival 151 b.,
which was »most 'helpful to
Lord Cortauld, who had won
over nine furlongs at Rosehill
earlier in the month and had
finished third to Aqua Boy at
Randwick a week before the
Denman.
The Cortaulds were in the
limelight at Randwick, as both
Lady Cortauld and Lord
Cortauld won races. The for-
mer first raced in Sydney as
Rise Again, but as there was
another horse of that name
racing in Melbourne the Aus-
tralian Registrar ordered a
change of title. Lady Cortauld,
when racing in New Zealand
as Rise Again, won three two-
year-old races, and victory in
the Three- and Four-year-old
Novice was anticipated because
she had been unlucky in minor
places at her two previous
starts. Lost River, well fancied
by connections after a recent
win at Hawkesbury, got too far
back in the field to be trouble-
some, and his fourth indicated
prospects at next run over a
middle distance. Lady Cor-
tauld is a four-year-old mare
by Resurgent (imp.) from
Stratocruiser (a half-sister to
Ark Royal).
Regal Glance, winner of
Q.T.C.’s First Canning Downs
Maiden Handicap for two-
year-olds, ran the five furlongs
in smart time, 60sec. The colt
is a brother to Kev Mar, who
has an imposing list of wins
against his name, among them
the A.J.C. Villiers Stakes of
1954. He is also a half-brother
to Big Spree (Queensland Cup)
and is closely related to Push-
over (Australian and Adelaide
Cups). He is by Passing Glance
(imp.) from Pinda D.

Melbourne Racing
Although her wins did not
benefit the average punter —
she started at 5 to 2 on and
6 to 1 on —Hyleena’s successes
at Moonee Valley last Satur-
day week and at Caulfield on
Boxing Day showed that she
is easily the best filly now
racing in Melbourne. Burdened
with 9st., she coasted home
eight lengths clear at the
Valley and ran the five
furlongs in l.lf, remarkable
time when it is remembered
that no horse has broken a
minute for the five-furlongs
journey at the little track. A
lift to 9.6 at Caulfield —secopd
top-weight 8.2 —made no im-
pression on the filly. This time
she won by 10 lengths on the
bit and yet ran the five in
59sec. The filly has now won
three races straight and was
second at each of her two
previous starts. Hyleena, who
is by Nilo from Hyroanie, has
been up a long time,. and
owner A. H. Griffiths is in-
clined to spell her rather than
tackle the colts in the Strad-
broke Stakes on New Year’s
Day.
Summer is not the time to
look for good-class stayers,
but perhaps Svengali’s win in
the 10-furlongs Fitzroy Welter
at the Valley last Saturday
week is an indication of a
bright staying future. It seems
odd to predict a good future
for a six-year-old gelding whose
previous career has been most
undistinguished Svengali’s


win in the Fitzroy was his first
success in the metropolitan
area. However, all his previous
racing had been over sprint
distances, and the stout manner
in which he ran-out the 10
furlongs of the Fitzroy showed
that staying is his game. The
prediction is based more on
his breeding than on that one
success. His sire, Enchanter,
was a good stayer in England,
and his dam, Maid,of Greece,
was by Parsee, who at one time
held the 10-furlongs record at
Flemington. Parsee’s dam was
by the mighty Carbine. The
wonder is that, with all that
staying-blood in his veins,
Svengali had not been tried as
a stayer before.
Main event at Caulfield on
Boxing Day was the £2OOO
Christmas Handicap. Planetoid
put up a notable performance
to win the race. He played up
badly at the barrier, and when
the tapes went up missed the
start. Jockey Ernie Sellars had
to ride the colt vigorously to
make up ground on the field
of smart stayers. Planetoid
responded so well that he hit
the front on the turn and held
off all challengers in the run
home. Owner Dave White-
side’s pleasure in the win was
marred by the stewards warn-
ing that repetition of the colt’s
bad barrier-manners would
result in his being banned from
racing from the starting-stalls.
It would be a pity to see the
brilliant three-year-old forced
out of racing.
It was Geoff Lane’s day at
the Valley last Saturday. The
20-year-old lad, who has been
Melbourne’s top apprentice for
the past three seasons, rode
four winners from the eight-
race programme. The young-
ster got an enthusiastic recep-
tion from the crowd, partly
for the feat and perhaps even
more because all his winners
except Music Case were
warmly supported. Lane, who
has ridden more than 300
winners (most of them on
country tracks), has had 18
wins in the metropolitan area
this season.
Memories of two of the
fastest mares to race on Mel-
bourne tracks in recent years
were revived when Music Case
and Star Cheval won races at
the Valley last Saturday.
Music Case spreadeagled the
field in the six furlongs less
20yds. of the second Fawkner
Welter. The four-year-old
gelding should be able to shift
along—he is by Law Case, who
won several sprint events in
Melbourne, from Rhythm
Queen, who at one time shared
the Australasian record for five
furlongs. Star Cheval, who
won the Somerton Handicap
over the same distance as the
Fawkner, is by the imported
Chavey Down from the High
Title mare Gay Queen, who
won the 1947 Newmarket
Handicap. It is a sound argu-
ment for looking as much to
the record of the mare as the
reputation of the sire when
investing in a yearling.
Before he came to Mel-
bourne, Samboru had won five
sprint events in Adelaide, but
“It’s a call for help !”
it took him three starts to
break through for his first
Melbourne win. He was for-
tunate to strike a very weak
field in the first Fawkner
Welter at the Valley last Satur-
day. He won well enough, but
still has not lived-up to the
reputation which preceded him
from Adelaide, and which
was built mainly on a win
over Jordan last July. Actually
Samboru was bought at the
Melbourne yearling-sales and
broken-in by Mentone trainer
George Paturzo. His Adelaide
owner, Mrs. E. F. Clingly, sent
him back to Paturzo when she
decided the ' four-year-old
Makarpura gelding was ready
to win in Melbourne.
* * *
The Cricketers
Westralian fast and off-spin
bowler Keith Slater, surprise
choice in the 12 named for
today’s second Test, has also
represented his State at Aus-
tralian Rules and at baseball.
He played for W.A. as a ruck-
man in the 1956 Australian
football carnival, and was
selected again for the 1958
centenary carnival in Mel-
bourne, but had to withdraw
through injury. If he plays in
the Test he will be the first
native-born Westralian selected
from his own State side to play
in a Test against England.
• • • •
On Westralia’s tour of the
eastern States this season Slater
did nothing out of the
ordinary with the ball, and
had very unflattering figures
in every match. His best
bowling this season was his
4-33 off 17 overs for W.A.
against the M.C.C. His action
has been labelled doubtful, as
have those of his Test-team
mates, Meckiff and Burke.
South Australia’s new fast-
bowlers, Alan Hitchcox and
Peter Trethewey, are other
suspect “chuckers.”
The second Test in 1954-55
appeared for most of the
match to be Australia’s. At
one stage England in its first
innings was 8-99, and its
eventual 154 was nothing won-
derful. Australia made 228,
after Burke and Favell, bat-
ting confidently for the second
wicket, had looked set for even
more. England fought back,
and May (104) made his first
Test-century against Australia.
Even so, the Australians, set
223 to win, seemed in the box-
seat —till Tyson (6-85) and
Statham (3-45) knocked them
out of it. Harvey was Aus-
tralia’s second-innings hero,
with 92 not-out out of 184.
Australia’s Test - captain,
Richie Benaud, was given
every chance in Tests by the
selectors—though their perse-
verance with him has paid-off
well and truly. In England in
1953, in three Tests and five
innings, he had a “highest
score” of seven and an average
of three, and took 2-174. In
1954-55 he did better, but was
still a bit lucky to hold his
place right through—he made
148 at an average of 16.4, and
took 10-377. In 1956, in Eng-
land, he made 200 at an aver-
age of 25 —second-top in the
averages, and including his
match-winning 97 in the
second Test —and took 8-330.
From an “averages” point of
view (not, of course, the whole
story) that’s not a particularly
good record; but Benaud’s
the man for the job now.
His recent innings of 113
against S.A. took Ken Mackay
to 5044 runs in Sheffield Shield,
the seventh batsman to top
5000 in Shield cricket, and the
first Queenslander to do so.
Mackay also hit a century
(137) against S.A. (Nov., 1955)
to become the highest-scoring
Queenslander in Shield cricket,
when he passed Don Tallon’s
3594 runs. “Slasher,” now 33,
played his first game for
Queensland against Ham-
mond’s 1946-47 M.C.C. side.
He reckons he’s playing on till
he passes Bradman’s 8896
runs ; but, big scorer as he is,
he’s still got a way to go to
pass the Don—and, of course,
he’s already had 20-odd more
Shield digs than the Master
had.
One or two features of the
first three days of the just-
concluded N.S.W. - Victoria
Shield match at the M.C.G. —
103 by young N.S.W. left-hand
bat Marks, giving him a cen-
tury in each of his two Shield
games; 108 by ’keeper Mad-
docks, in a fighting knock,
associated in turn with Shaw
and Potter, after Victoria had
crashed to be 4-29; N.S.W.
fast-bowler Gordon Rorke’s
6-52 (five clean-bowled) in Vic-
toria’s first innings, after hav-
ing 3-9 as he tumbled out the
early batsmen; Jim Burke’s
faster-than-his-usual 77 in
N.S.W.’s second innings.

they crowd back, these
ghosts in Memory’s Bar,
until the bar is extended
beyond the horizon.
There’s Percy Lindsay throw-
ing the spaghetti to the ceiling
of the flat: “If it sticks, it’s
cooked!” says Percy, against
a background of excellent oils
of clouds, just clouds in as
many moods as man is capable
of seeing. And Percy and I,
complete with kilts and
sporrans, and Scotch within as
well as without, driving the
milkman’s horse and the milk-
man almost crazy as we
“assist” the deliveries on a
New Year’s Day.
And Mick Paul adding his
spare glass-eye to a restaurant
pie and marching out with it
“as evidence,”' following the
restaurant’s defence of a case
wherein a mouse was alleged
to have been found in one of
its pies. And Mick and his
journalistic friend did not pay
for. those which they had
dispatched to dark and empty
regions.
“It is always handy to have
a spare eye,” saith Mick.
And in this bar of spectres
is one who does not drink.
He is Reg L. (“Snowy”) Baker,
Australia’s all - round athlete,
who was director of the sport-
ing side of the Rivera Country
Club at Santa Monica, outside
Los Angeles.,
“Snowy” had taken me into
his cabin off the polo - field,
where Spencer Tracy, Jack
Holt, Hoot Gibson and the
American Chaffeys, and their
Australian cousins, were drink-
ing canned beer, and talking
horse. I had been admiring
the Australian gumtrees, the
passion-fruit, and other signs
of Snowy’s Australian feeling
about the polo-field.
“Don’t you ever get home-
sick?” I asked.
“Of course I do. Come in
here.”
He led me into a back room,
cluttered with riding - boots,
mallets and other parapher-
nalia of the polo-player and
horseman. Snowy went to an
old-fashioned chest-of-drawers,
opened a drawer and took-out
a small glass bottle.
“Whenever I get homesick
I take the cork out of this
bottle and have a sniff,” he
said, with a wistful grin on
his rugged, handsome dial.
“Smell it.”
I sniffed. It was Australian
boronia . . .
Yes, Memory’s Bar is
crowded. We’d better move
out, until we move in, per-
manently, when that old
gentleman with the whiskers
and the scythe says: “Time,
gentlemen, please!”
Quite by accident he dis-
covered her occupation of
Stella's room. Unable to sleep,
he tried the connecting door,
driven by an obscure desire to
gain some kind of comfort.
The door was locked.
Furiously he rattled the handle
—then was still, as Miriam's
softly-mocking laughter came
to him, coyly admonishing.
“Now, now, Edmund, I'm
not that kind of woman, and
well you know it. Come, old
boy—back to beddo!”
He knew, then, the extent
of her evil. She was obscene.
Cold and empty, he stood, still
hearing the echo of that
laughter.
Supposing he locked her out
of the flat? She would appeal
to the neighbors, and the
ground was well prepared
there. They were stiff and
unfriendly towards him,
obviously kept informed of his
lack of gratitude. Sometimes
they stared curiously at him.
Did they think he was a bit
off-the-beam? Was that what
she inferred to them?
All his life Edmund had
lived conventionally. Now he
saw what an unbreakable
mould he had encased himself
in. Outside of decency and
formal good behavior, he was
lost' without direction of any
kind.
He wept.
Where did she get her pocket-
money? He found out, as he
began to miss cherished articles
that had vanished from the flat,
just as he found the heap of
whisky-bottles, and knew her to
be a secret drinker, though she
had effectively banished from
the table his select wines and
occasional brandy. She did
everything backwards, follow-
ing some sadistic, inverted
pattern of her own.
And she stayed on.
TTe could go, himself, and
leave her the flat. But he’d
just renewed the two-year
lease on it— and where would
he go? What would his neigh-
bors say when they saw him
denuding the flat of its fittings
and leaving Miriam stranded
here?
Steve Kidd asked him, with
studied nonchalance, how his
nerves were doing these days?
Any better?
Thin, haggard and dis-
traught, Edmund laughed too
shrilly. He knew it, by Steve’s
startled look.
“Never felt better,” he
insisted, plainly lying.
What a fool he was! Why
hadn’t he admitted to stress of
mind? But then how might
not that admission be turned
against him as evidence, later
on? Later?
Then he had finally accepted
the fact that Miriam’s behavior
was part of a plan. She had
succeeded so far in her purpose
because from the very first she
had understood exactly the
kind of man he was.
Edmund eventually consulted
the head of the religious sect
to which Miriam belonged. It
was a vain hope.
The man swept . aside all
criticism, of his best worker.
Miriam was one of The Holy
Sisterhood—they were beyond
reproach.
“If I were a psychologist,”
the bearded preacher said pon-
derously, fingertips together
beneath his Romanish nose, “I
should say you were in love
with our Miriam. Subcon-
sciously. How long is it since
your . wife’s death? Eight
months. Ah. And Miriam
such a fine, full - bodied,
domestic type. I don’t blame
you, Mr. Rushe, no, indeed!”
And his shiny red tongue
licked his full bottom lip, leav-
ing it aglisten.
Edmund considered the idea
of suicide. And discarded it,
because that would be playing
into Miriam’s plump white
hands. That way she'd get
everything she wanted: flat,
respectability, the lot. No,
he’d be damned if he’d hand it
to her on a platter.
Adding to the atmosphere of
eerie unreality was the fact that
they never openly quarrelled.
They remained, outwardly,
polite to each other. They went
out together. Miriam placidly
agreed with all his suggestions,
and softly, doggedly, untiringly
opposed them. He was living
in a world without solidity, a
nightmare world from which
he couldn’t wake.
The Sunday afternoon on
which he found her fat Peke
chewing up his snapshot album,
in which he had painstakingly
stuck all the better ones of
Stella, he broke down and cried
before her. There lay the bits
of chewed-over, spewed-up bits
of glossy cardboard, scattered
all over the rug. It was too
much.
He didn't hear her ring for
Dr. Pendrick. But he heard
him come, and sat up, hearing
Miriam say: “He has these
turns, doctor. I wanted you
to see him. He seems very
melancholy.”
Useless to protest, it only
damned him. There she stood
with that sanctimonious smile
on her face, the dark wings of
her hair casting shadows on her
plump cheeks. She had actually
gained a kind of beauty these
last months. She looked more
like Stella, and the old ugly,
self - effacement was gone.
When she moved close to him,
he trembled with horror.
It was the beginning of the
nightmares. Night after night
he awoke, drenched with sweat,
sick arid shivering, worn-out
from the effort of dreadful acts
he committed in his dreams.
Night after night he killed
Miriam, strangling, stabbing,
poisoning, bashing and drown-
ing her.
And morning after morning
when he arose the coffee was
made, weak as she liked it, a
hard-boiled egg was served for
his breakfast (and when he
failed to eat it Miriam herself
ate it with a laughing “Waste
not, want not! ”); he accepted
the untidy paper to read on the
train, and he faced his day
without hope.
“You’re very ill, you know,”
Miriam told him, when his
shaking hands and haggard face
caught her attention. “Per-
haps you’ve got what Stella
died of.”
“I’ve got you,” he said.
It was one of the few really
vicious things he had ever
said. And it was one of the last
things he ever said ; but
Miriam refused to see the
viciousness, and if she fore-
saw the future, she didn’t show
it.

you’ve come to realise it at
last.”


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.K. MIGRATION
'T'here is something highly
impressive in the courage
and calm logic with which the
U.K. Government faces the
problems arising from its policy
of unrestricted migration to
Britain of Commonwealth
citizens of any creed or color.
Commenting on a move in the
House of Commons to impose
some restrictions and to
repatriate the “idle, the unfit
and the criminal, irrespective
of race or color,” Edinburgh
“Scotsman” points out that
“what must be understood is
that the principle of unre-
stricted immigration stands as
continuing proof of the
sincerity with which Britain
opposes the color-bar”:
“Any weakening, any
watering-down of this principle
could be undertaken only from
racialistic motives which no one
would fail to detect in the back-
ground. Since most of the
colored community here [in
Britain] are in any case good
citizens, it may be asked what
they have to fear from such a
motion.
“The real point is that it
would make their position in
the mother country less secure
than the position of other
British citizens. It would make
them second-class British
citizens- If idleness alone were
to be held sufficient cause for
deportation, we should have to
deport a rather high percentage
of our white population. To
refuse the Commonwealth
immigrant full rights of citizen-
ship is to repudiate the Com-
monwealth.
“As the mother country
Britain holds a special position.
By creating the Commonwealth
her people made themselves a
cosmopolitan community. The
centre of the Commonwealth
cannot be other than cosmo-
politan. Britain can exercise a
certain leadership so long as
human dignity is defended in
the concept of the British
citizen.”
In similar vein, “Manchester
Guardian” comments that “the
heart of the case against
limitations on entry is as
sound as ever”:
“It is that if Britain is the
centre of the Commonwealth
she cannot withdraw one of the
few tangible benefits
which Commonwealth citizen-
ship confers —the right to visit
and dwell at the centre —with-
out whittling down the mean-
ing of the Commonwealth
almost to vanishing-point. The
advocates of restriction failed
to meet this case.
“Though the debate was in
fact concerned with colored
immigrants, the restrictionists

were at pains to point out that
they intended no discrimina-
tion of race, color or creed.
But no one examined what
would happen if ‘the idle, the
unfit and the criminal’ from
all over the Commonwealth
were to be kept out. Who are
the idle and unfit, anyhow?
Mr. Cyril Osborne said ‘we
should not allow anyone to
come to this country without
having a job.’ One need only
think of the Canadians, Aus-
tralians and New Zealanders
who now come here and try
their chance to imagine what
an outcry such a measure
would provoke from the older
Dominions.”
Touching on migrants from
“the older Dominions,” A. N.
Raphael notes elsewhere in the
“Manchester Guardian” that
“of the genuine settlers, it is
thought that there are now Lin
Britain] about 60,000 Aus-
tralians, 35,000 Canadians, over
25,000 South Africans and at
least 10,000 New Zealanders”:
“These estimates represent
roughly half-a-century’s migra-
tion. It reached a peak in the
post-war decade, and shows
little sign of abating. Common-
wealth Governments, of course,
do nothing to encourage the
exodus. Their London repre-
sentatives, anxious for British
brains as well as brawn (see the
‘public appointments’ advertise-
ments in any newspaper), are
naturally a little sensitive about
the stream of highly educated
young people arriving by every
boat from home.
“They realise only too well
that culturally and socially
Britain has so much more to
offer ; that the sensitive in-
tellectual is happier away from
the muscular society ; that the
thriving oasis of the arts in
Australia is too small to sustain
its many talented singers,
dancers, writers and comedians.
Underlying the civil servants’
sensitivity is their pride in their
countrymen’s achievements,
that so many have reached the
top in Britain.
“It has been an incon-
spicuous invasion, as if remote
second-cousins had quietly
taken a house in the next street.
It creates no problems or
tensions: immigrants from the
old Dominions are white, and
if they compete, it is for the
higher-level job. Certainly the
higher spheres glitter with
Commonwealth stars —ballet,
plastic surgery, journalism,
industry, banking, teaching,
variety, music (both performers
and composers), advertising,
literature and the stage.
“Titles abound. There are
the press lords, industrial
barons, business baronets, and
academic, medical and tele-
vision knights. Of course, not

Cows and Bull
'There is, suggests Baltimore
(U.S.A.) “Sun,” an element
of unreality in the many com-
parisons of the Russian with
the American economy:
“It is a little like comparing
a Spanish fighting bull with an
American milking-shorthorn
sire. The animals belong to the
same breed and the same
gender, but they differ basically
in purpose. The fighting bull,
like the Russian economy, is
devoted exclusively to war. The
milking-shorthorn is like the
American economy in that it
aims primarily at gratifying
consumer expectations.
“This difference between the
two systems works both for
and against the American
economy in any comparison.
Take, for instance, the figures
on steel-production. The 1957
capacity of the American mills
was some 144-million tons,
while Soviet capacity was only
55-million tons. In the sweep-
ing announcements of his new
seven-year plan Mr. Khrush-
chev says he expects to catch-
up and even surpass the
Americans.
“But it is probable that right
now the amount of steel
devoted to war in the two
economies is more nearly even


than the gross figures suggest.
That is true because very large
parts of the Soviet steel-pro-
duction go into military usages,
while the American steel-mills
supply a variety of consumer-
industries, including the might-
ily voracious automobile
business. Were the American
economy to cut its civilian auto
output to the levels of such
output in Russia, our war
potential would boom indeed.”
Berlin
nPHE Soviet policy of keeping
A the international kettle
boiling by jumping from one
hot .spot to another and back-
ing out only in face of a
definite stand by the West is
pretty familiar by now —
although it has been surprising
how long some commentators
have taken to recognise the
almost standard behavior-
pattern. In a particularly clear
summing-up of the Russian
modus operandi, Don Salvador
de Madariaga writes in
London “Time and Tide” that
“those who, from Peking to
Moscow, conduct the peace-
campaign are determined to
keep the world —and not only
the West—on the qui-vive”:
“When one of them has
shouted enough and begins to
feel hoarse, the other takes his
turn. Mr. Dulles once spoke
of ‘the brink.’ But he only
used the word ; he didn’t get
there. The peace-campaigners
from Moscow and Peking seem
to enjoy living on the brink ;
and the reason is simple ; they
draw their own line.
“Immediately, of course, one
thinks of Berlin, threatened by
Mr. Khrushchev, having
already perhaps forgotten
Quemoy and Matsu. The West
was startled by the thousands
of shells fired by the Chinese,
the threats of invasion, the
dark hints at the ‘liberation’ of
Formosa and the Pescadores.
Indeed we showed signs of
panic.
“It was not panic. It was
partly real concern in a dan-
gerous situation difficult to
estimate ; and partly a desire
to impress the world, and in
particular the electorate. We
heard hard things then about
the folly of the American
leaders who refused to be
rushed into concessions. Had
the leaders of the West listened
to these wise men they would
have embarked upon a slippery
path of concession that might
have ended in the loss of
Formosa. No one speaks
about Quemoy and Matsu
nowadays. Someone else is
shouting.
“And who remembers those
heroics to which Mr. Khrush-
chev treated the world when
the Americans landed in
Lebanon and the British in
Jordan? That was another
‘brink.’ It did seem that
Turkey was going to be
devoured straightaway by her
powerful neighbor, and that

“Again, one recalls the
famous Bulganin letters during
the Suez crisis. That was inter-
continental - missile rattling of
the first order. Letters were
sent to every Government,
from the Swedish to the
Spanish, all personally signed
by Mr. Bulganin, each care-
fully suited to the particular
point of view, interests and
even prejudices of the country
concerned, all pointing to the
same conclusion: that it was
very dangerous to side with
the United States because when
it came to blows the Soviet
Union would reduce to smoke
and ashes any nation that had
dared to do so. But where is
Mr. Bulganin now?
“So we, who were made to
shake with fear by Mr. Bul-
ganin’s letters, Mr. Khrush-
chev’s Asia Minor threats and
Mr. Chou En-lai’s Quemoy
and Matsu cannonades, are
now to shake in our shoes over
Berlin. The music, this time,
is not unlike that of the
Quemoy-Matsu episode. ‘This
is a purely internal German
affair.’ And the Western Ger-
mans are exhorted to deal
directly with their brethren, the
Eastern Germans.
“The first thing that strikes
the observer is that the West
Germans are, and- always have
been, ready to deal with their
Eastern brethren. What they
will not do is to deal with
Comrades Pieck and Ulbricht,
who are not East Germans
but Soviet agents.
“ The Soviet leaders know
full well that if their troops
were evacuated from East
Berlin or Eastern Germany, or
both, the Communist regime
there would collapse. Not even
the military forces which under
various names have been
organised to hold down the
people of Eastern Germany,
not even these forces, Com-
munist as they are bound to
be, could then be relied upon
to defend a regime which is
driving every Eastern German
who can to escape.
“Mr. Khrushchev, therefore,
sounds hollow. He may walk
to the brink, he will not over-
step it. He may threaten the
West with all kinds of
measures, but he will not stand
up to those who stand up to
him. He is too well aware of
the fundamental weakness in
his position, which is that,
when it comes to the ‘hour of
truth,’ what will matter most
will not be missiles, atomic
weapons, aircraft or tanks or
waves of men, but the deep
conviction of everybody in
Germany that the Soviet
system is a corrupt and oppres-
sive one which must be. de-
feated or at least confined
within the borders of Russia.
Since this is the conviction of
the German people, these
manoeuvres aimed at false ‘re-
unification’ of Germany, with
Comrades Pieck and Ulbrichf
on board to pilot the ship
towards Moscow, are not
likely to deceive the Germans.
“The Berlin episode will
soon have joined that of Bul-
ganin’s letters in a political
limbo and probably much
sooner than the day when Mr.
Khrushchev himself will have
joined Mr. Bulganin in the
provincial limbo of Soviet ex-
Fiihrers.”

military assistance London
“Financial . Times” suggests
that “there are now signs that
the U.S. may be entering a
third phase in which the
emphasis will again revert to
economic aid, although the
main recipients will no longer
be in Western Europe”:
“One reason for this new
turn in U.S. thinking is of
course the anxiety about the
‘Soviet economic threat,’ a
broad concept which covers
a variety of worries emanating
from Russia’s own economic
growth and her overseas trade-
and aid-activities. But there is
another reason for the change
of emphasis less widely appre-
ciated on this side of the
Atlantic. This is connected
with the development of
the intercontinental ballistic
missile and the changes it is
bringing in U.S. defence
strategy.
“Following the successful
trial of the Atlas 1.C.8.M.
there have been reports that
production of the Thor and
Jupiter intermediate-range mis-
siles may be terminated after
present contracts have been
filled—and other reports of a
similar kind are current in
Washington. It is in fact cer-
tain that President Eisenhower
is trying to hold his defence
budget down as near to the
current level as he possibly
can, and that the extra expen-
diture on long-range missiles
will therefore be partly at the
expense of conventional forces
or intermediate-range projec-
tiles, both of which involve
substantial overseas expendi-
ture.
“While the U.S. Administra-
tion has no intention of going
back on existing commitments,
it is unlikely that overseas
strategic bases will have quite
the same importance once the
nuclear deterrent can be
launched from inside the
borders of the U.S. In the last
financial year direct U.S. mili-
tary spending abroad came to
some $2lOO million—in addi-
tion to the $3OOO million given
in defence aid. If overseas
military spending is to decline,
something will have to take its
place if the flow of U.S.
financial support to some poli-
tically vulnerable allies is not
to dwindle.”
Menzies for Canada?
YIfHEN, in Canberra, Canadian
W Prime Minister Diefen-
baker was asked whether there
was any truth in reports that
Australian Prime Minister
Menzies might be offered the
post of Governor-General of
Canada, he replied that
although such reports were
“conjecture,” he “saw no
reason why, in years ahead,
consideration should not be
given to an interchange of
Governors - General from
member-nations within the
Commonwealth.”
Commenting, Edinburgh
“Scotsman” points out that
“such a prospect is not incon-
sistent with the understandings
and traditions which, in the
absence of a written Constitu-
tion, determine the ways of
the Commonwealth. A
Governor-General, in essentials,
has the same status in relation
to the administration of public
affairs as is held by the
Sovereign in Great Britain.
“Although the practice was
different in other times, today
the Governor-General of a
member-nation of the Com-
monwealth is appointed by the
Queen on the recommendation
of the country concerned. The
Government of the United
Kingdom has no voice in the
matter.
“There are at present
Governors-General who are
subjects of the country in
which they represent her
Majesty, but it would not be
a revolutionary extension of
practice to appoint to one
Commonwealth country a
national of another Common-
wealth country. After all, that
is what would happen iff
Canada should ask for a
person normally resident in
Great Britain.
“If her Majesty’s Govern-
ment in Canada recommended
that the Queen of Canada
appoint an Australian as her
next representative, it would
presumably require only that
her Majesty, as Queen of Aus-
tralia, should ascertain Aus-
tralia’s view, of the matter.
“Constitutionally, t h e n,
there would appear to be no
obstacle to such ‘cross-posting’
of her Majesty’s subjects, pro-
vided that the two countries
concerned were agreeable to
the suggestion. From the
aspect of the general well-being
of the Commonwealth, and
particularly for the develop-
ment of a better lateral under-
standing between member-
States, the idea is very attfac-
tive. If it should first be
realised in the specific appoint-
ment which Mr. Diefenbaker
dismissed as ‘conjecture,’ it
would be an experiment carry-
ing a rich prospect of success.”

all the way, and we made good
time.
was having its last
season with the blades, and
was starting next day, so we
stayed to see what it was like.
After the noise of the machines
it was very quiet.
Contrary to general opinion,
also the well-known song,
shears do not click. The gullets
of the blades are filled with
soft wood, or sometimes with
cork. These are called
“knockers,” and they stop the
heels of the blades from meet-
ing, so the sound is a soft
“chop, chop.” Then there is
a band of leather from the
heel of one blade to the back
of the other. This is the
“driver,” and its purpose is to
prevent the hand from slipping
forward onto the blades. And
the “stopper,” another leather
strap, to stop the shears from
opening too wide. Not many
men have hands big enough to
allow the shears to open to
their fullest extent, so the
stopper is fitted to the size of
the. hand. None of these
attachments are on the shears
when bought, and a shearer
- would spend hours setting them
up to his liking.
The machines of the time
were no faster than the blades,
but they shore closer, and the
fleece would weigh up to 2lb.
heavier. They also cut the
sheep more, but seldom so
severely. A cut with the blades
usually meant stitching, while
a dab with the tar-brush was
considered sufficient treatment
for a machine-cut.
Shears were honed to a
razor-edge, cleaned and
polished, then wrapped-up
carefully when not in use. A
good whetstone was always
a prized possession, and always
kept in wraps. “Mudgee stones”
(a slate stone obtained only m
that district) were always
admired and envied by those
not owning one. And few
shearers would allow anyone to
use their “Mudgee.” In fact,
it was considered very bad
manners to ask for the loan
of any of a blade-shearer's
tools of trade.
'T'here were several fast
A shearers at Coonimbia.
Three tallies of 160 were cut
that day, and that, in six-tooth
wethers, is damn’ fast shearing.
Jack Bull, despite his age,
was well up with the leaders.
Watching him fascinated me ;
the casual manner with which
he used those razor-sharp,
needle-pointed shears. He
never seemed to be moving fast,
but every blow was wide, and
his shears were always full.
No movement was ever wasted,
and though I have seen many
faster shearers I have never
seen better or cleaner.
There was more rhythm in
a blade-shed, possibly because
of the lack of noise. A big
machine-shed sounds like
10,000 locusts on a hot day,
with the whirring of the
machines and the hum of the
overhead gear and friction-
wheels. The only sounds in a
blade-shed are the soft “chop,
chop” of the knockers and a
low ringing noise as the blades
come together. As an onlooker,
I found it very ssothing.
Blade-shearing has gone for
ever, and of the men who used
the blades very few are alive
today. In 1905 it was well on
the way out, 75 per cent, of
the sheds were machine, and
the remainder were rapidly
changing over. Most of the
men were well up in years, and
no blade-shed had learners.
Much has been written about
the building-up of the Aus-
tralian wool industry, and
credit has been given to many
men who deserved none. But
the blade-shearer is seldom
mentioned, except to curse him
for trying to better his condi-
tions of working and living.
All the histories I have read
have been written by people
sitting in cushioned chairs,
whisky and cigars at their
elbow, and in front of them
reference-books written by
other people with as little
knowledge as themselves. They
would know nothing of the
men who lived like dogs as the
swagmen do, till the western
stations shore, as Henry
Lawson wrote.
The shearer did more for
democracy in Australia than
all the politicians. He was
nevei afraid to stick up for his
rights, and though he was shot
at, and jailed, he stuck to his
guns, till today, when the
shearer is one of the most im-
poitant workers in Australia,
and it is all owed to the blade-
shearers.

that Calga had been delayed by
rain, and had not yet started,
We went through Coonamble
in a hurry, and five miles out
Hermann’s store-van overtook
us, and as the driver was taking
supplies for the Calga shear-
ing he offered us a lift. But
we were unlucky, for the roll
had been called an hour before
we arrived. To quote Henry
Lawson again, “For men were
many, and sheds were full, for
work in the towns was slack.”
There were 50 spare men to
fill any vacant pens.
The manager was very sorry,
but, as he said, he could not
be expected to hold pens on
the off-chance of us turning-
up. Which, of course, was fair
enough.
We met two families at Calga
who travelled all the year
round, going from job to job,
in four-wheeled vans, covered
with a frame over which canvas
was stretched. These vans
were similar to the American
covered-wagon, from which
they had probably been
adapted. Drawn by two horses,
of the coacher type, they were
a handy and reasonably fast
method of transport. Two
children were with each van,
and they seemed to be in the
best of health. The eldest
would have been about five and
the youngest was a toddler,
The women were in their early
twenties, but, like most bush
women of that time, they
looked much older,
Invited to their fire that
night, we yarned till midnight,
The men, both shearers, had
come to Calga in the hope of
vacant pens, and now intended
making for the Riverina, where
they were well known, and
were sure of getting plenty of
shearing. The women were
satisfied with their way of
living, and thought it much
better than working on a
station for £1 a week and
rations. We had seen many
of these people on the roads,
but this was the fi rs t time we
had talked to any of them.
/"Toorianawa adjoined Calga.
This station had been made
famous, some years previously,
by the song “Goorianawa,” in
which a shearer told of getting
the spear, after shearing only
three sheep.
An uncle of mine, a shearer,
always stayed at my father’s
home in Sydney, and had
taught me the song when I was
about 10 years old. I don’t
know if Uncle Tom had ever
shorn at Goorianawa, but have
an idea he had. I still remem-
bered the song, and soon taught
Dutchy, so we strolled along
beefing it out.
We called in at the shed (a
new one) and found they were
having a lot of trouble with
the machines, something went
wrong with the overhead-gear,
and shearers were standing at
their pens holding onto sheep
shorn to various stages, while
the expert, who looked after


all shearing-gear, climbed
among the wheels, tightening
a nut here, slackening another
there. The shearers were
grumbling and cursing, while
the rousies were lolling about,
with cheerful grins, enjoying
every minute of it. Their pay
was going on all the time, so
they had nothing to worry
about.
We had three weeks to get
to Rockedgiel, so were in no
hurry. At Bugaldi we got two
days’ work, woodcutting, then
went on to Coonabarabran.
This was a very pretty little
town. At the head of the Castle-
reagh River, and on the eastern
side of the Warrumbungle
Mountains, it was noted for
having one of the largest
balancing-rocks in the world,
the Timor Rock.
I never knew the actual
measurements, but it was as
big as a small house, and must
have weighed 200 tons. The
pedestal would have been
about 6ft. in diameter. The
spring which becomes the
Castlereagh gushes out of a
cliff about 200yds, from the
Rock. The Castlereagh is
known for its changes of direc-
tion. It runs east to Purle-
waugh, south to Mendooran,
west to Gilgandra, and north
to Coonamble. From there to
Combogolong north-west, then
west again to its junction with
the Macquarie, in the reed-
beds at Carinda. The total
length is 350 miles. At Gular-
gambone, after travelling 150
miles, it is only 30 miles from
its source, but it has gone
round three-quarters of the
length of the Warrumbungles.
We went down through
Uliman and Bomera ; then, to
kill time, went over Pandora
Pass to Coolah. Pandora Pass
is the junction of the Liver-
pool and Warrumbungle
Ranges. From the top of the
pass is one of the grandest
views in New South Wales.
Looking south, the mountains
round Mudgee, 70 miles away,
stood out clearly. North, the
Liverpool Plains, like a green
carpet, stretched away for 50
miles, till they merged into the
dark green of the cypress-pine
forests of the Pilliga. When
Alan Cunningham was climb-
ing the pass from the Talbragan
River he must have been
wondering what he would find
when he reached the top, as
Pandora did before she
opened the famous box. Hence
the name.
was a nice little town,
and everyone seemed to
have plenty of money. The
three pubs were always full;
in fact, the chief occupation of
the locals seemed to be drink-
ing beer. Many strangers,
mostly shearers, were in town,
and in every bar huge tallies
were being cut, and the world
seemed made of wool. Men
were opening-up the neck,
driving ’em on the long blow,
racing down the whipping-side,
belly-wool and locks were
piling up, till Coolah was in
danger of being overwhelmed
by an avalanche of wool. The
merits and demerits of blades
and machines were hotly dis-
cussed, while lambs, hoggets,
two-, four- and six-tooth
wethers and “rosellas” (other-
wise, bare-bellied yowes) were
going down the chute head-to-
tail in a never-ending stream.
“And I sat on a corner stool
and listened to them shear.”
The words “cobbler” and
“tar” were never mentioned.
Having been a shearer, I may
be prejudiced, but I think the
shearer is justified, to a certain
extent, in - boasting of his
prowess. An individual worker,
his earnings depend entirely
on his shearing ability, and a
good shearer has something to
be proud of. Handling such an
unpredictable animal as a
sheep, quiet one moment, kick-
ing the next, he must, to avoid
cutting the sheep, be able to
think, and act, quick. Also,
never lose his temper, even if
the boss of the board is on his
back ail the time. So he may
be forgiven if he relaxes after
a few grogs.
We started singing at the
top pub that night, and the
publican invited us into the
bar. It was a wise move on his
part, for the bar was soon
crowded and he had to work
hard to cope with his customers.
And we had a wonderful recep-
tion. A tray had been placed
on the bar, and after a couple
of songs the publican would
yell, “A few bob for the
singers, boys!” And they
responded nobly.
The invitation to “Have a
drink with me, mate” was con-
tinuous. I managed to avoid
these by saying, in my most
apologetic manner, that, though
I loved beer, it would hurt my
throat and prevent me from
singing. But at closing-time
several of the chaps carried
Dutchy down the main street
to a camp on a stretcher,
chanting the “Funeral March.”
They decided it would be a
good idea to stay and look
after him, so the mob, nine
big men, crawled into our six-
by-eight tent.
Seeing the situation was
hopeless, I built up the fire
and camped alongside it, but
got no sleep as the snoring and
groaning never stopped till
daylight. Then they came out,
dirty and bleary-eyed, all feel-
ing sorry for themselves, and
went up to the pub for a hair
of the dog that had bitten them.
Dutchy was a bit ashamed of
himself, but I cheered him up.
After a few mugs of strong
black tea he managed to grin
and say, “Well, it was a
blanky bonser night.”
TTS7E went back to Rockedgiel
* * by a different and longer
route, by Queensborough, The
Black Stump, Binnia Downs,
Oakey Creek and The Flags.
I have often been asked if
there ever was a place called
The Black Stump. Most people
have the idea that it is a figure
of speech, similar to ‘ the back
of beyond.” But The Black
Stump was real. About nine
or 10 miles from Coolah, on
the Gunnedah road, it had been
a wine-shanty. When I saw it
in 1905 it had been closed-
down for many years, and was
a ruin. I believe it was com-
pletely burnt in a bushfire a
few years later. I don’t know
if it was licensed under that
name, but I have always heard
it spoken of as The Black
Stump. And the property on
which it stood is still known
as The Black Stump today.
The roll-call at Rockedgiel
found us ready and waiting.
The sheep were very rough,
and for my part I would have
walked out after the first run.
But the Agreement was still
very much in favor of the
owner, and a shearer could not
leave if he was dissatisfied,
though he. could be sacked if
the owner was not satisfied. The
only way he could get out was
to “shear for the sack” ; that
is, knock the sheep about, and
few men would do this, for
to build up a reputation as a
rough shearer made it hard to
get sheds. So we had to grin
and bear it.
Many of the squatters bred
their sheep on the theory that
wrinkly sheep carried more
and better wool. This was
right up to a point. The
wrinkles had a lot of good fine
wool, but when the sheep went
down the chutes he still had
that wool on him. The only
way to get it all was to skin
him. So big tallies were out
of the question, and the boss
of the board was a petty
tyrant. I think he might have
served his apprenticeship on
Goorianawa, but most of the
shearers reckoned he was born
that way. He seemed to be
standing over me most of the
day, but when I mentioned this,
half the shed claimed the
honor, so I may have been
wrong. He was just as tough
on the pickers-up. They are
the only shed-hands under his
control, piece-pickers and wool-
rollers coming under the
control of the wool-classers.
Several of the pickers-up,
including Dutchy, to take the
monotony out of their work,
had developed a style of
handling the fleeces which was
purely their own. Instead of
walking to the tables they would
waitz, timing their approach so
their backs would be to the
table, throw the fleece over
their heads, then waltz back to
pick up another. They had it
worked out to a fine art, and
their job was done neatly and
efficiently. But the boss insisted
that it be done the way he
wanted it. He was foolish.
Reprisals started at once. He
dived into his bunk that night
to find it loaded with Bathurst-
burrs and black-thistles. He
spent half the night getting the
burrs out of his blankets, and
came to the shed in the morn-
ing in a raging temper, to be
greeted with smiling faces, and
a chorus of “Good morning,
sir,” from 10 happy loppies.
All day the work went on
smoothly. Every fleece was
handled strictly to rules, picked
up by four corners, carried to
the tables and spread gently
out. No one was chipped, no
sheep was faulted. McMaster,
the owner, came in at smoke-oh
and said that if any man was
found playing stupid jokes he
would be sacked. Which was
a waste of breath.
The boss was tame for a
few days, then regained his old


form In fact, he became
worse, so when he grabbed the
bell-rope one morning to start
shearing he realised, too late,
that it had been dipped in a
sanitary pan. This nearly
caused a strike, as he refused
to start the shed till the per-
petrator of this outrage came
forward and confessed. We
lost an hour’s shearing before
the rep. calmed him down by
threatening to pull all the men
out. He spent most of the day
cross-examining the rousies,
while we shore away in peace.
I think McMaster must have
told him to go quiet, for he
was no further trouble to any-
one, but at the cut-out, when
we were at the office getting
our cheques, he said he would
like to meet the man, face to
face, who had fixed up the
rope.
Dutchy stepped forward and
said, “I did both jobs.”
The boss looked at him for
a few moments and said, “Ail
right. I’ll know you in future.”
Dutchy replied, “Any time
you’d like to know me a little
better, it will be a pleasure.”
So the incident closed. I was
pleased that the boss did not
try to push the matter further,
as it could have ended only
one way, for Dutchy, though
1 have never known him to
start a fight, was one of the
best men of his weight in the
western districts at that time,
and a good boxer can give
away a lot of weight.
TTaving no more sheds for
that season, we decided to
go back to the Coonamble
district. Tug Moon offered us
a lift to Coolah, and as we had
done so well in that town a
few weeks previously we went
with him.
Tug Moon was the cook at
Rockedgiel, and apart from
being a first-class cook he was
a notable dancer, and his
services as Master of Cere-
monies were always in
demand. I have seen several
of the American square-dance
callers, and Tug could have
given any of them a lot of
start.
On the.way to Coolah over
Pandora Pass (where the beauty
of the views again amazed me)
he told a story against himself
of an incident which had
happened in that town a few
years before. He was M.C.-ing
a dance, and was drinking
heavily. He tried to close the
dance, but all there were enjoy-
ing themselves, and kept calling
for more, and it looked like
going on till morning. But in
the first sets of the quadrilles,
at “Ladies half-right, gents
half-left,” Tug shouted,
“Harlots left, blankards right.”
He was knocked flat on his
back by some offended husband
or lover, and lay half-stunned
for a moment, then sat up
and yelled, “The moon’s down,
the dance is done.”
When he finished his yarn
he was quiet for a while, then
remarked: “They should have
shot me.”
This story was vouched for
by several people who were at
the dance when it happened.
And they bore him no ill-will.
“Poor old Tug had a few in,”
was the explanation.
/~Vur publican friend was a
busy man, but he asked
us to come up and sing a
few songs that night. Several
local sheds had cut-out, and
Coolah was even more crowded
than on our first visit. Accom-
modation was out of question,
so we pitched our tent on the
flat near the creek. We had
another great night at the pub.
I discovered that by adding
lemonade to beer it wasn’t such
a bad drink after all ; but
Dutchy was very wary of it.
We went to the dance on
Saturday night. Tug Moon,
with all his sins forgiven, was
M.C. and, keeping strictly
sober, did a great job. The
music was a violin, concertina
and tin-whistle. Dutchy was
in top form, and spent most of
the night teaching the only
daughter of a wealthy squatter
the latest steps, which had not
yet reached Coolah. He was
getting on so well with her that
I suggested that we stay in
Coolah, and he could marry
her, and I would give-up the
track and come and live With
them. This made him very
annoyed, so I think he must
have been pretty serious about
her.
But squatter's daughters
don’t marry swagmen.
TX7E went to Binnaway, then
Mendooran, Tooraweenah
and Box Ridge. Our wander-
ings were not altogether aim-
less. We would hear of jobs
and make for them, only to
find them full-handed. But at
Box Ridge we met two chaps
who needed two partners in a
fencing-contract. They were
brothers, Alf and Bill Freeman.
The fence was the boundary
between Gumin and Goori-
anawa, and was a tough-
looking job. But the price, for
those times, was good: £45 a
mile. (Today it would be £400.)
Starting on the flat country
at Goorianawa we climbed a
watershed and followed it to
the top of Mount Bulaway, the
second-highest peak in the
Warrumbungies. There was no
surveyed line. When the two
stations had first taken the
country they had agreed to
take the watershed as the
boundary, and use the highest
peaks as the markers. So we
had to pick our own line,
going from one peak to the
next-highest, gaining height all
the time till we reached the top.
When the completed job was
measured we were paid for
15! miles. As the crow flies
it would be about five miles.
Four-feet high, 3ft. netting,
three plain and three barbed
wires, it was supposed to be
dingo- and rabbit-proof. The
wire was to be brought and
put on the line by the Gumin
bullock-team. We cut the
posts as we cleared the line.
We camped for the first
few weeks in the old shearing-
shed, and when the wind was
whistling through the empty
pens we wondered if the ghosts
of the old shearers were revisit-
ing the scenes of their hard-
ships. We often sang “Goori-
anawa,” and when Campbell
heard us one night he was
greatly interested, as he had
not heard it before, and was
much amused by it. When
having a party he invited us
up to entertain his guests. Bill
was a fair singer, and Alf
played the concertina, so we
were able to put on a good
show. Campbell put two-quid
on to our first progress-cheque.
We shifted camp to Salty
Creek, a valley running back
into the mountains, on the
Gumin side, and stayed there
till the job ended. It was a
lonely place, and the dingoes
were plentiful. When sheep
were grazed here they were
shepherded, and yarded at
night. Only full-grown cattle
and horses could survive ; if
a beast fell down it was the
end.
The dingoes’ howling at night
was eerie, and they got very
cheeky at times, coming close
to the camp. A shot fired in
their general direction would
scatter them.
The Freemans, who had been
born at Tooraweenah, knew
the ways of the dingoes very
well. They pointed out the
different howl of the purebred
and the mixed-breed. A pure-
bred always starts off straight
into a long, rising howl, with-
out any preliminaries, while
the mixed-breed always gives
one or two short barks before
starting his howl.
Tom Varty, a professional
dingo-hunter, camped near us
for a few days, and he agreed
with the Freemans. Tom was
something of a character. Over
6ft. in height, and broad in
proportion, he had a red beard
that he said had never been
cut. His hair reached his
shoulders ; he never w'ore
boots, and was seldom without
h;s rifle. He would have made
an excellent model for the
American frontiersman. He
poisoned, trapped and shot
dingoes all the year round,
getting a £l-bonus from the
Pastures Protection Board and
10s. from Gumin station.
He said the pack-dingoes
did little damage to stock,
being content to live on
rabbits and the native game.
The occasional rogue, mostly
a domestic cross, was the real
menace. These dogs usually
worked alone, and killed for
the sake of killing. The pack
would feed on the dead bodies,
and were blamed for the
slaughter. The rogues were
identified sooner or later, and
a high price set on their scalps.
The P.P.B. would increase their
bonus, and the squatters and
cockies would offer sums
according to their holdings.
(While at Rockedgiel there was
a rogue dingo killed at Pandora
Pass for which the sum of
£56 had been paid. This was
the highest amount known to
have been paid up till that
time.)
I wondered how one dog
could be picked out of
hundreds as a killer, and Tom
said that a rogue would be
just as likely to get into a
mob of sheep in the daytime as
at night, or, after a big killing,
would gorge himself, and sleep
it off near his victims. Once
seen, the hunt was on, and
as the crossbred dog usually
had distinctive markings, he
soon became well known.
Mallee-hens were also a
feature of Salty Creek. These
birds were about the size of
the domestic fowl, and were
noted for their nests, which
were mounds of soil and leaves,
sometimes 20ft. in diameter,
and 6ft. high. Twenty or 30
birds would use the same nest,
and the eggs would be laid in
a row, round the mound, at a
depth of 2ft., with the small
end up. Eggs were incu-
bated by the heat generated

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Debating in Jails
Many people think of Mel-
bourne's Pentridge jail as a
compound for the reception of
the anti-social, who remain so,
but a small section of public-
spirited men has interested
itself in trying to re-establish
and reorientate convicted men
while they are in jail. An
education scheme is in opera-
tion within the penal depart-
ment, and although it does not
reap a harvest of success —
that is not expected—its exist-
ence is encouraging.
One very small facet of the
education scheme at Pentridge
is debating, and it is both
interesting and encouraging to
see just what effect debating
has had on the men concerned
and on the prisoners who com-
prise the audience.
The Latrobe Debating Club
in “A” division (Pentridge jail
consists of various divisions,
“A” division including just
over 100 men who are partici-
pating in the education
scheme) was formed in August,
1953, and named after "Vic-
toria’s first Governor, who was
interested in penal reform. The
club has 15 members the
maximum number allowed by
jail regulations and meets
each Friday under the chair-
manship of an inmate who
controls the meeting in a
manner better than any other
chairman I have seen. Every
motion is fully debated and
accepted or rejected with due
procedure (even divisions have
been called for). The minute-
book records all business and
this book is a revelation in
clarity and scope ; some day no
doubt it will be made public.
Part of these meetings are
given to the training of the
members as debaters. This
training may take the form of
an explanatory address by some
visiting debater assisted by
some of the club’s own
experienced members. There
may also be impromptu
speeches, a “heckle-hour” or a
practice debate. It is an ex-
perience to see the seriousness
with which these meetings are
taken ; all the men are
anxious to speak, and some of
them make amazing progress.
Some members have never
made a public utterance before
arriving at Pentridge, yet in
the debating-club they strive
for the chance to speak.
The self-discipline is rigid.
At first many experience
extreme nervous tension, but
control comes in due course.
It is hard to see a better
means of training men to learn
self-restraint and respect for
authority. The atmosphere at
meetings is friendly, yet
rivalry is strong and there are
many examples of men
developing from timid dis-
organised speakers to first-class
debaters with a respect for
discipline combined with per-
missible debating arrogance.
Competitive debating is well
established. Two teams par-
ticipate in the Debaters’ Asso-
ciation of Victoria competi-
tion. These debates are con-
ducted before a large audience,
often consisting of up to 100
prisoners and 80 visitors.
The basic justification for
debating within Pentridge is
the good effect it has had on
prisoners. It has given men an
understanding of the value of
speech and a respect for
“ Watch out for him—he always catches the biggest fish.”
authority. The time comes
when it is no use merely telling
a law-breaker he must observe
the law ; it is worth showing
him how to train his mind to
higher ideals. You cannot
debate on a lofty subject with-
out improving mind and
morals, and by contact with
visiting teams the prisoners
have become better social units
in society. The Latrobe Debat-
ing Club members are proud
of their achievements, and
debating has given these men
a new interest in life.
If a man knows he has to
speak for 15 minutes he has to
prepare well. For many, such
a thing was unknown outside,
yet in jail they strive to im-
prove their ability to talk on
the most varied subjects.
It seems pointless to have
physical discipline if a man’s
mind is to be disregarded
during the period of physical
restraint. Debating gives the
men an outlet which has helped
them to see the value of disci-
pline, and it takes some courage
to address 150 people.
Debating is now part of
prison life. It has given an
interest and recreation to some ;
to others it has been the door-
way to a better assessment of
life. To all it has been a useful
means of getting some relief
from the waste of prison life.

Indonesia
In his defence of the Indo-
nesian claim to Dutch New
Guinea (B. 10/12/’5B) Charles
Meeking made no reference to
the basic argument put forward
by the Indonesian Government
—that the people of that part
of New Guinea have cultural
and ethnic relationship to the
Indonesians. /
They haven’t, and the Indo-
nesian claim to ownership on
this ground is untenable and,
if conceded, would be as
logically applicable to the Aus-
tralian-held portion of the
island.
The natives of West New
Guinea —nearly all of whom
are primitive tribesmen are
likely to fare much better under
Dutch rule than under Indo-
nesian. Indonesia hasn’t the
political stability, the capital
resources or trained adminis-
trative staff to develop the
region. The Dutch, one of the
most successful of the colonial
powers, have.
If the Netherlands Govern-
ment decides to get out of New
Guinea its natural successor is
Australia, which not only
controls the rest of the island
but has shown the capacity to
advance the natives in
civilisation. — Terry the Tory
(N.S.W.).
Norfolk Island
Although only a speck in
the ocean, Norfolk Island
territory is likely to prove as
much a headache to an Aus-
tralian Government as Nauru.
The problems are similar
and dissimilar. While on
Nauru it’s a question of find-
ing a new home for the
population when phosphatic
deposits are worked out in an
estimated 20 or so years, on
Norfolk it is a question of
markets for the primary pro-
ducts on which depends the
bulk of the island’s popula-
tion of 800.
Whatever product is tried
by the Norfolk farmer —and
he has tried a few in recent
years, from lemons and
bananas to passionfruit and
bean-seed (the current popular
crop)—he has run-up against
embargoes either in M.L. (his
nearest market) or Australia.
From the agricultural point
of view marketing his produce
is so difficult that, were it not
for a whaling industry worth
£20,000 to 60 islanders regu-
larly employed for three
months of the year, there
would be economic distress,
Where self-government (sug-
gested for 1961) will break
down (if it is tried) is in leader-
ship, even if the islanders take
cheerfully to the concomitant
rates and taxes on this hitherto
tax-free land. There are few
potential leaders on the island,
where education standards are
low, except for “migrants”
from M.L. and Australia, most
of whom are in the retired class
anyway.
Those islanders who have
studied the problem most
acutely feel that the future
would be more secure were the
territory linked in the same
way to Australia as is Lord
Howe Island (admittedly,
there is three times the popula-
tion to be considered). With
voting rights there would then
be an outlet for any grievances,
imaginary or otherwise. Such
an arrangement, it is believed,
would simplify administration
and also help sort-out the
production-marketing difficulty.
The Australian Government
now subsidises the island to


the tune of more than £30,000
a year. This could be con-
siderably reduced by a closer
link with Australia and a rise
in overall incomes by an inte-
grated agricultural policy
enabling some local revenue
to be available for administra-
tion and development.— Plain

Housing Problems
It seems reasonable to believe
that the accommodation short-
age in N. S. Wales will not be
relieved in the foreseeable
future unless the private
investor is invited and
encouraged to resume invest-
ment in “bricks and mortar.”
Class-conscious legislation,
grandiose housing - schemes,
sub-standard hostels and huge
staffs of officialdom have really
made little impact on this most
serious and acute social
problem. I suggest the scrap-
ping of the cumbersome,
intricate legislation and
machinery which dominate
housing and deprive the
homeless who, incidentally,
are by no means poverty-
stricken of much - needed
home-life and privacy.
For many years the Land-
lord and Tenant Act. 1899,
with its simple provisions,
served the community well,
and with certain modifications
would do so again. We should
restore to the property-owner
his inalienable right to control
and manage his own affairs ;
then investors will once again
regard house-building and
-ownership as a gilt-edged
security for savings.
In the main, house-property
is not a wild-cat gamble, and,
with few exceptions, landlords
were/’are satisfied with reason-
able returns, Mr. Cahill’s
fantastic forebodings notwith-
standing. Care can be taken
of the exceptions, and rigid
fair-rent legislation look after
the lessees’ interests.
If, as Mr. Justice Hardie is
reported to have said recently,
the present tenancy law is
equally unintelligible in Eng-
lish and in Yiddish, it’s up to
the Landa outfit to start from
taws again. And, while it’s
about it, the holiday-homes
racket —the legalised negation
of all fair-rent principles—
could be jettisoned or radically
revised. —J. S. (N.S.W.).
Shaw and Smollett
The shade of G. B. Shaw
must have smiled at newspaper
reports that he borrowed his
theme for “Pygmalion” from
“It’s time they put traffic-lights on this crossing."
a story written by Australian
writer Ethel Turner and pub-
lished in 1897 in the now-
defunct “Windsor Magazine.”
As a Bulletin writer
pointed out some years ago,
the source of Shaw’s inspira-
tion was obviously an incident
in Tobias Smollett's picaresque
novel, Peregrine Pickle, which
was written some 200 years
ago. The resemblances be-
tween Smollett’s little comedy
of manners —it comprises a
single brief chapter of his book
—and Shaw's pointed satire on
English society are too marked
for mere coincidence. Eliza
Doolittle is obviously drawn
from the beggar-wench, with
a fluent Billingsgate vocabu-
lary, whom Pickle undertakes
to transform in a few weeks
into “an accomplished young
lady of uncommon wit and
excellent understanding.”
Pickle, like Professor Hig-
gins, had “observed that the
conversation of those who are
dignified with the appellation
of polite company is neither
more edifying nor entertaining
than that which is met with
among the lower classes of
mankind ; and that the only
essential difference, in point
of demeanor, is the form of
an education. which the
meanest capacity can acquire
without much study or appli-
cation.”
The main elements in the
play are to be found in
Smollett's sketch Eliza’s
forcible objection .to being
washed, her inveterate habit
of swearing, her tuition in
polite etiquette, and her suc-
cessful launching in society.
Even the incident when she
shocked her genteel acquain-
tances by lapsing into her
original vernacular is “lifted”
by Shaw from Smollett —ex-
cept that, as a concession to
20th-century gentility, the ex-
tremely coarse expression used
by the beggar-wench is trans-
lated into a repartee more
acceptable to the Edwardian
English stage. Wusslean

W.A. Road Boards
If “R.H.G.” will leave his
“one-man office” long enough
to contact the W.A. Local
Government Department he’ll
be told, as I was, that rate-
payers have no right to attend
road-board meetings.
They may be permitted to
attend, and I have no doubt
they are in most country dis-
tricts ; in fact, in most districts
the secretary probably
imagines, like “R. H. G.” (B.
10/12/’sB) r that they can’t be
denied admittance. But I can
assure him that the members
of his board who “go into com-
mittee” to avoid unwelcome
visitors are taking a lot of
unnecessary trouble. All they
have to do is tell the ratepayers
they’re not wanted. Simpler
still, they can advertise the
fact —and it is a fact —that
ratepayers may attend the
meetings of the board only by
invitation, and that invitations
will be issued only in special
cases. As for the ratepayers’
meeting which “R.H.G.” says
can be convened at any time,
that is vastly different from the
ordinary board - meetings, and
the convening is a slow,
laborious business.
Surely the presence of a
stenographer doesn't imply a
“plush-lined set-up,” although
it may be far in advance of
"R..H.G.’s” one-man country
office, in his case obviously
the "one man” has to “hammer
out his own minutes.” The

TV
The position of creative
writers in relation to TV is
even worse than “Archaen”
thinks (B. 3/12/’5B). When in
England J found that TV
wanted only situation-
comedies of the “Charley’s
Aunt" type, •or cops-and-
robbers plays with no more
characterisation than an Edgar
Wallace thriller. Occasionally
an original script with a super-
natural twist was used ; but
most plays were adapted from
published stories by well-
known writers.
They paid £BO for a script,
plus additional half-fees if tele-
vised in other areas ; but in
most cases material is never
used twice.

America are higher: $l2OO is
the usual rate. But scripts
mostly have to be written to
fit a current series, such as
“Wagon Train,” “Restless
Gun” and “Tales of a Texas
Ranger.” Even then the door
isn’t open to all writers.
No . TV-studio buys direct
from the writer. Material must
be submitted through a literary
agent, and agents won’t look
at a script unless it bears a
well-known name. Further,
every script has to be accom-
panied by a “release form” in
which the writer surrenders all
rights for evermore, and if a
sale is made the agent takes a
big bite out of the $l2OO dol-
lars for commission.
In Australia the position
looks hopeless for years to
come. Both the A.B.C. and
the commercial stations have
huge stocks of old films to
use before they will be look-
ing for original scripts. Writers
will not be the only ones
affected. Actors and actresses
who have been employed in
making plays for radio, are
likely to find themselves super-
fluous when TV and its potted
films really gets a stranglehold.
Overseas experience suggests
that it is useless to try to fight
TV, and almost as hopeless to
try to compete with it. The
vested interests of big news-
papers and wealthy sponsors
are behind it. One can only
throw back at “the one-eyed
monster” all the specious
claims made by its supporters.
Here in Australia we can begin
with the claims, made when
evidence was being taken for
the granting of commercial
TV licences, that the applicants
would “offer new and expand-
ing markets for local writers
and artists.”
Such statements are already
beginning to look like hot-
air. Harry Horsefeathers

N.S.W. Elections
Many people feel that a
change in the State Govern-
ment is necessary for the
general welfare and progress of
N.S.W., but they need to be
convinced that the present
Opposition is capable of
governing.
The Opposition must first
show that it can manage its
own affairs and control its own
members. Changes of leader-
ship and discord among Parlia-
mentary representatives have
“ Wouldn’t it sicken you —now they’re teaching
her to FLY.”
shaken the confidence of sup-
porters and of the unattached
voter.
Second, it is essential that,
on some questions of the day,
the party clearly state its views.
These questions relate to such
controversial items as
gambling, poker-machines,
equal pay, etc. Some may be
offended, but others will be
drawn in by a forthright
statement of policy. Gains
should be greater than losses —
a strong stand always has an
appeal.
Third, the arrangement that
three rural seats are to be
contested by two candidates,
Liberal and Country party,
should be changed. Only one
candidate should be presented
to electors from one party or
the other. The combined
resources of money and
workers could then come in
solidly behind the only aspirant
offering in the anti-Labor field.
A well-controlled team with
a definite policy, coupled with
100 per cent, co-operation with
the Country party, could not
fail to attract. It would
promote that spirit of confi-
dence which is very necessary
to win the next elections for
the Liberal and Country
parties.—C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
Savings-bank Statistics
Several interesting features
emerge from an analysis of
Australian savings - banks
statistics which have just been
published—the figures are at
September 30, 1958.
First, a grand total for the
whole of Australia has been
achieved of £1320 million.
This is spread over 7,935,000
“operative” accounts and
means, of course, that many
people are holding more than
one pass-book. As to this, it
must also be borne in mind
that in Victoria, one bank
alone (State Savings Bank) has
the huge total of 639,783
“inoperative accounts with
balances of less than £l.” The
bank disregards these inopera-
tive accounts in arriving at the
average amount at credit of
depositors of £l7l 9s. 4d.
That a huge total of over
£l3OO million (earning interest)
is held by the various savings-
banks, virtually at call i.e.,
repayable on demand pro-
vides food for thought!, as
does the holding of several
pass-books (with very likely
the maximum amount in each)
by individual depositors.
The increase for the year,
for the whole of Australia, was
£67 million, of which the three
private savings-banks (N.S.W.,
A.N.Z., and C.8.C.) raked-in
£4O million, and what may be
termed the Government banks
(Commonwealth, State, and
Trustee) provided the balance
of £27 million. The public’s
preference for the private
banks is thus clearly indicated.
On the other hand, it may
show that active private enter-
prise will beat Government and
semi - Government concerns
hands-down every time. Labor
politicians with views on bank-
ing, and most of them are in
that category, might take note
of those figures.
Still, the Government banks
seem to be waking-up, and the
scramble for accounts goes on
between the two groups. In
this connection it is of interest
to note that the State Savings
Bank of Victoria alone opened
33 new branches and 26 new'
agencies in their last financial
year. Despite all that frantic
activity, that bank’s increase in
deposits, for the year to June
30, 1958, was £22,449 less than
the amount of interest added to
depositors’ accounts in that
year.
It’s all very interesting, and
things have certainly moved
a long way since the days
when savings-banks were first
set-up for the purpose of
“providing a safe place where
poor settlers, mechanics and
laborers could get a little
interest on their money over
and above what they needed
for their living-requirements.”
The only similarity would seem
to be that the interest paid is
still On the “little” side.
On the question of savings,
another point which might be
chewed over is the fact that
the amount owing under hire-
purchase agreements is about
equal to 25 per cent, of the
total of savings-bank deposits.
And here’s something else:
the statistician show's that the
average per operative account
is £166 and the average per
head of population for Aus-
tralia is £134. Now, when it is
borne in mind that so many
people have several pass-books
in the different banks, a sum
of £166 per account is not very
much in these inflationary days,
and certainly would not last
long in the event of a depres-
sion hitting Australia. And
then, of course, there are the
h.-p. commitments. Ceg

in the decaying leaves. As
the chicks hatched they
scratched their way to the
top, went over the side, and
made for the nearest cover like
a flash. Don’t know if the
mother-bird rounds them up
and looks after them, but most
bushmen have the idea that the
chicks know how to take care
of themselves from the moment
they leave the egg.
VX/T were high on the water-
shed now, the going was
getting rough, and we were
worried about getting the wire
on the line. None of us thought
it would be possible to get
the bullock-team up to where
we were working, but Billy
Harlow laughed at our fears.
He spent a day looking for a
route up the mountains, blazed
a tree-line, and then, going up
gullies and sidlings, twisting and
turning, he reached the fence-
line. The route we walked
would have been a bit over a
mile ; Billy’s track would have
been five. He started at sun-
rise with the load, and was
with us for lunch.
Twice the dray had cap-
sized, and was dragged on its
side to the next gully, where he
hooked the leaders on and
pulled it back on the wheels.
Once he was q quarter of a
mile from the line, but still had
two miles to go. And the only
sound we heard was the “chock-
chock” of the axle. Billy never
used a whip, and seldom spoke
to his team above his normal
voice, If he got into a tight
spot he would say, in a
reproving manner, “Well, what
a lot of useless cows a man's
stuck with.” He would
straighten them up and say,
“Now then, you blanky lot of
blankards, show us what you
can do,” and they never let
him down.
When he halted the bullocks,
he apologised for taking so
long on the trip, and men-
tioned the two capsizes. He
reckoned he lost an hour
getting the dray upright again.
Billy Harlow was un-
doubtedly a professor in the
art of bullock-punching. His
father and grandfather had
been bullockies, so Billy was
born to the trade. He looked
after his bullocks well, and
treated each one as an
individual. As he took the
yokes off at night he would give
each one a scratch behind the
ears and a pat on the rump.
Bullocks are very fond of
kurrajong-leaves and prefer
them even when grass is green
and plentiful, so he always
lopped a good supply for them.
He had a whip tied under the
dray, and one night gave us
a demonstration of whip-
cracking. The handle was 6ft.,
with a 10ft. greenhide thong,
and the way he used it made
me feel sorry for any un-
fortunate bullock that he might'
use it on.. I asked why he
didn’t carry the whip, and he
drawled: “Well, I carry it
over my shoulder, and the end
drags in the ground, and wears
out pretty quick, so I’d always
be making new ones. Anyhow,
you don’t need a whip if your
team's properly broken-in.”
A bullock-team is made up
in four parts: polers, pin, body
and leaders. The leaders are
the most important, being the
mainstay of the team. The
polers have to be good, also,
for they have the job of steady-
ing the dray or wagon while
the pin-bullocks take the pull.
The body is the bulk of the
team, sometimes 20 or more,
the laborers of the team, mainly
noted for their strength.
Billy’s team was 14 all told,
and it was an unforgettable
sight to see them plodding,
sometimes scrambling, up hills
that seemed to be too sleep
for anything to climb, with
the dray, loaded high with
wire, swaying behind them.
Any bit of level ground he
would halt the team, and the
bullocks would lay down, in
the yokes, belch up a wad of
cud, and start chewing as if
they didn’t have a care in the
world.
Poor, patient bullocks, they
played a mighty part in making
Australia a good place to live
in. The horses did a great job,
but pride of place must go
to the bullocks. They lived
where horses starved, and when
horses were bogged-down and
helpless the bullocks kept the
wheels turning, be it ever so
slow.
YX/T made good progress with
* ' the fence, but the last mile
steadied us up. Centuries back
there had been a huge land-
slide, and it was too steep even
for Billy Harlow to get his
team over, so the wire had to
be carried, and it was tough
work. But we got there, and
felt the pride of achievement.
Campbell, of Goorianawa,
and O'Connor, of . Gumin,
inspected and measured the
fence, and complimented us on
a good job. Everyone was
pleased, especially Dutchy and
myself. We had been away
from home just a year, were
204- years old, and had com-
pleted one of the roughest and
highest fencing-lines in the
State. (Bulaway is 3300 ft.
above sea-level.)
We thought of a trip to
Sydney, but knowing our
families were still having a
bad spin, as most families were,
we decided to send most of
our cash home instead.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
THE BEST WAY TO MILK
By W. G. WHITTLESTONE
Tn this article I want to get
down to the fundamentals
of milking. From what we
have already learned it is not
quite as easy as it looks. All
good farmers know this. And
they come in two types: those
who have been brought-up in
a good tradition of cow-
husbandry, and those who
have studied the problem and
applied their knowledge.
Generally you will find they
both agree on most things.
Before we get down to
business I would like to tell you
of an experience which drives
this point home. 1 was called
in to check-up the running of
an expensive “tandem” milking-
shed, where a pedigree herd
was being milked, but where
production was terrible and
milking very slow.
It didn’t take long to find the
trouble. I suggested a change
in shed-management. Briefly,
this involved cutting out the
separate washing-bail, using a
stimulating wash in the milk-
When asked for his
advice on the Castra-
tion of Bull Calves a
veterinary expert in-
cluded the following
in his lengthy reply:
“Bull Calves are
castrated at any age
from six weeks to
six months, but the
earlier the operation
is done, within rea-
son, the better.
Avoid extremes of
weather for the
operation pick a
mild day. The Elas-
trator method is quite
suitable for younger
calves and is quite
efficient.”
ing-bails, putting the cups on
straightaway and cutting out
hand-stripping.
When I went back some time
later I found that the shed
had been taken over by a
Jersey Islander brought-up in
true Jersey tradition. He had
not been told of my recom-
“ He's an old sea-captain scared about the
cock-eyed Bobs”
mendations, but the procedure
which he had introduced was
almost identical with my own
suggestions. Talking to him,
I found that we agreed almost
entirely on general principles.
Incidentally, as a result of this
change in management there
was a marked increase in pro-
duction.
It is hard to learn from a
traditional type of expert, be-
cause he instinctively does the
right thing without quite know-
ing why. The scientific
approach is easier, because, by
understanding the nature of
the problems, it is possible to
find a solution by reasoning.
The object of this series of
articles has been to give readers
a background of knowledge
from which to approach milk-
ing problems with understand-
ing.
This last article of the
present series is a practical
summary of what has been
learned. In other articles in
the future I hope to deal with
questions which arise on the
dairyfarm not directly related
to the actual problem of
efficient milking.
Well, then ; what is the best
way to run the milking? I
think the following is the best
sort of procedure:
Before bringing in the cows,
if there is only one man in
the shed, or while the other
chap is bringing in the cows
if there are two of you, fill the
vacuum-pump lubricators, start
the machine and flush it with
an antiseptic solution of
chlorine or iodophor. The cows
should be brought in quietly:
don’t use dogs unless you have
a tame house-dog which
doesn't cause excitement. And
don’t use a whip. A well-
handled herd will come in with-
out any persuasion.
When they are in the yard
let the leading ladies take their
rightful places in the bails.
There is a social order in the
herd, so don't insult the im-
portant members by excluding
them from the privilege of
being milked first. It’s a good
idea to have a control-fence
between the main yard and the
bails, so that you can avoid
crowding in the bails. This
avoids troubles due to the
upper-class members butting
and stirring-up their less
dominant sisters a real
problem when they are
crowded together near the
machines.
Don’t use leg-ropes. They
are filthy things, not needed in
any well-run shed. There must
be something wrong with the
training of the cows if leg-
ropes are needed. Back-chains
are all right —though I know
farmers who don’t use them.
In a properly equipped shed
each bail has a hose and
running water. As soon as each
cow is brought in, her udder
is washed vigorously, using the
bare hands and the hose. A
clean udder-cloth, squeezed-out
from a chlorine, iodine or
quaternary - ammonium solu-
tion, is then used to finish the
cleaning of the teats and lower
parts of the udder. Finally, a
squirt is taken from each teat
into a strip-cup to see if there
are any signs of mastitis. This
also helps to stimulate the cow.
If you make a good job of
this, it will take 30 or 40
seconds from starting the
washing to taking the last
squirt. The cups should then
be put straight on.
Good farmers use some kind
of flow-indicating sight-glass.
There are two makes on the
market, so they are easily
obtained. When the flow starts
to fail in the indicator,
machine-stripping or weighting
should be applied where needed.
Don't wait till the cow has
almost finished before machine-
stripping.
When the indicator is almost
clear, take the cups off. Many
cows need no sort
of machine-stripping.
Some need weighting.
This is best done with
a piece of metal which
brings the weight of the
cups and claw up to
81b. (no more). But
don’t use weights unless
you 'have to.
If you have cows that
are used to hand-
stripping, use vigorous
machine - stripping as soon
as the indicator starts to
clear. Rub the udder and pull
down on the cups ; add a
weight if necessary. When the
second flow starts (watch the
indicator!) leave the cow to
finish by herself. Many quickly
learn to have a second let-
dow'n to the machine without
the extra stimulation.
Cows with mastitis should
be milked last. (This upsets the
routine, but is an unfortunate
necessity.) Their teats should
be covered with an antiseptis
before they go out, but don’t
use greasy teat-salves there
are good non-greasy ones avail-
able.
In the model shed cows are
used to going into any bail,
which simplifies the running of
the shed. Milking is at the

same time every day, the whole
routine is smooth and quiet,
and the cows are contented.
It is not necessary to try to
make the milking intervals
equal, but if you use uneven
intervals watch-out for low
fats at the morning milking.
As soon as milking is
finished, a small amount of
warm water should be used
to rinse-out the machine. The
vacuum is not broken. The
teat-cups are scrubbed in hot
detergent on the outside, and
then at least one gallon of cold
water is drawn through each
set of cups, starting at the
releaser end. Put two gallons
through the last set (but don’t
break the vacuum). Now put
through similar amounts of hot
alkaline detergent in the same
order (use acid detergent on
one day of each week), and
finally flush with the same
volume of boiling water.
Pull the releaser to pieces
and put the parts on a rack in
the milk-room. Remove the
cup - assemblies and long
rubbers, and put them in the
same place. It’s a good idea
to soak the cups and rubbers
one day each week in alkaline
detergent.)
If you follow this sort of
procedure your machine will
keep clean and the quality of
the milk produced will remain
high. If you manage the cows
in the w'ay I have described
you will get faster miking and
more milk.
I have assumed that you
have managed to find someone
to service your machine, so that
it is always in good order. This
is a problem I would like to
discuss in a future article.
There are other problems, too,
which we should discuss, but
in this series I hope I have at
least made the job of milking
more efficient and also more
interesting.
Aerial Topdressisig
“Warihi”: In New Zealand
62 private contractors and one
-farmers’ co-op. are now taking
part in aerial topdressing,
utilising 12,000 airstrips. No
less than 45 per cent, of all
topdressing is now being done
from the air.
When the idea was first put
forward in 1926 by a Hunter-
ville farmer Government
Departments laughed it out of
court. In 1938 and again in
1943 a pilot of the Ministry of
Works revived the suggestion,
but met with no greater
success, even though he gave
a successful demonstration.
Then, in 1947, the R.N.Z.A.F.
sold a Tiger Moth for £75,
and its purchaser adapted it for
aerial topdressing. To date, as
one of 172 Moths engaged in
the industry, it has grossed
£60,000. Besides the Moths,
another 90 machines of assorted
makes are in use (including a
Dakota which can cover as
much as 1700 acres in a day).
Odd jobs like dropping
fingerlings into creeks are just
part of the day’s march—22,ooo
of them were recently scattered
in a day. Helicopters are also
being found handy for spray-
ing hormones- and other
chemicals. They can come
down to 50ft. from the target,
and down-draught from the
spinners helps to direct the
sprays.
Urochloa
“Myall”: In the past 15
years urochloa-grass (or Liver-
seed) has spread over most of
Queensland’s Darling Downs.
It came from India, no one
knows how or when ; but Mr.
Liverseed found it growing on
his property near Warwick,
recognised its value and sowed
some seed. The grass quickly
spread over his property and
proved itself an excellent
stock-grass, both palatable and
a good milk-producer. A
loosely tufted annual, with
soft and succulent leaves, it
grows to about 2ft. high.
Sown in spring, when frost-
danger is past, at the rate of
61b. to 81b. an acre, it gives
good grazing, under favorable
conditions, until well into the
autumn. It’s a grass not par-
ticular as to soil, thriving
equally well on the heavy,
black plains, the lighter red
and black loams, and the
gravelly ridges. Though not
drought-resistant, it responds to
every light shower, and after a
dry spell is one of the first
grasses to supply feed.
The plant seeds heavily ; if
a paddock is shut-up in
February enough seed will be
shed to grow a dense stand the
following spring.
Urochloa has also proved its
worth by smothering the
poisonous mint-weed (Salvia
reflexd), which grows freely in
many parts of the Downs, and
by crowding-out a heavy
growth of Bathurst-burr.
Pecan-nuts
“North”: The pecan-nut is
closely allied to the walnut,
though superior in quality. The
tree, which js deciduous, lives
to a great age and sometimes
grows as high as 70ft. When
in full leaf, it is handsome and
makes a good shade- and
shelter-tree. It will succeed in
any part of Australia where
there’s reasonable rainfall and
deep, fairly fertile soil.
To allow, for spreading,
plant trees 40ft. to 50ft. apart.
They grow slowly for the first
year, but then make rapid
progress, reaching about 40ft,
in 10 years. Once established,
they can withstand long periods
of drought and adverse con-
ditions. Bearing starts at five
or six years, and at 15 up to
4001 b of nuts may be harvested.
This yield will increase as the
tree grows older.
The kernel of the pecan-
nut is enclosed in a thin, woody
husk, brown in color, oval
in shape and easy to break
open. The nut-meat is rich and
of high food-value, with a large
percentage of oil.
Export Fruit
''Spin”: In his 1958 annual
report the Australian Fruit
Officer in London stresses the
importance of strict inspection
for spray-residue and San Jose
scale. Spray-residue was
apparently very pronounced
early last season, particularly
on fruit from Victoria, and the
report emphasises the difficult
problems that this can lead
to at the European end.
The San Jose scale found on
a consignment of Westralian
fruit attracted unwonted atten-
tion to Australian lines, so
inspection on the Continent and
in England will naturally be
keener. It’ll have to be keener
at our end, too, and growers
have been warned that in
future there’ll be no tolerance
whatever given by the Aus-
tralian inspection-service. One
scale found in a case will cause
the entire line to be rejected.
The report deals with some
experiments in packaging,
pointing out that there are
only two ways of tackling the
problem of damage in transit,
particularly bruising. One is
to educate the manpower in-
volved in all the different hand-
ling processes, and to discipline
WOOL SAMPLES
Actual wool samples are
attached to and classified on
Wool Type Card. This Card
has many uses—as growers,
classers and students in most
parts of Australia have dis-
covered—in particular when
snap classification has to be
made in the yards or shed,
or in the paddock, with a
type, perhaps, outside the
main run of your experience.
There’s a big difference be-
tween knowing and guessing.
A comparison study, using
the Bradford Wool Type
Card, eliminates the. possi-
bility of error. Your name
and address and a postal
note for 7/6 addressed to
“The Bulletin” will send one
on its way.

73 YEARS OF SERVICE
TO THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC
those who won’t co-operate;
the other to use a package
which is strong enough to pre-
vent bruising, but which can’t
be handled without bulk-
handling equipment.
Nobody with any experience
of docks and dockworkers will
think that the solution lies in
educating them to handle goods
carefully. That leaves packag-
ing as the sole solution ; and
the report lists three experi-
ments tried out last season.
They were:
1. Bulk-bins with jumble-
pack apples of mixed sizes
from 2-yin. to 2iin., equipped
to a varying extent with anti-
bruise pads and each holding
about 10501 b. of fruit. The
containers were handled with-
out any trouble and the fruit
reached the market bruise-free
and looking as though it had
just been picked. (The report
mentions that the bins were
later used to ship ripe tomatoes
from the Channel Islands to
London and they proved better
than the usual method of
packaging.)
2. Steel-mesh crates, each
containing 24 cartons of apples,
got the fruit to London docks
in good condition, but weren’t
suitable for rail-transport in
England. The crates are pricey
and transport is difficult from
packing-shed to ship and from
ship to market; but these diffi-
culties may be resolved by
further experiments.
3. Cell-packed cartons
reached the markets generally
bruise-free, so there seems to
be a future for this type of
pack.
As experiments, these trial-
shipments were successful, and
encouraging. It seems almost
certain that eventually some
form of bulkdiandling will
emerge which will reduce costs
and get fruit to market in better
condition. Certainly the present
method of packing isn’t suitable
and can’t stand up to the treat-
ment meted out on wharves.
Competition for the English
and European markets is grow-
ing, and to hold our place
there we’ve got to supply fruit
in better condition and possibly
accept lower prices. Bulk-
handling seems the only
answer, and further experiment
the only way of finding the best
method.
Early Weaning
“Sundowner”: Early wean-
ing of lambs —a new idea m
sheep-management —could lead
to lower wool-production costs,
as trials in South Australia
have shown. Both quality and
quantity of the wool are in-
creased.
On many properties the ewe
and lamb compete for feed, and
the lamb comes off worst. How-
ever, if lambs are weaned early
and become accustomed to
digesting bulky feed while it s
still green and palatable they
are better able to take dry feed
in the autumn.
Shock and the consequent
loss in condition associated
with weaning is considerably
reduced if lambs are weaned
on good, nutritious food. The
ewe’s milk is of little value
after three months; reliance
on the mother for longer
periods often prevents a lamb
fending for itself.
In one test, lambs were
weaned at three to four months
and fed on a small pick of
lucerne during the summer.
Growth was exceptional, and
they produced well-nourished,
dust-free wool. Best time for
weaning seems to be two
months after the last lamb is
dropped.
Another advantage of early
weaning is that ewes can be
restricted to a small area on
poorer pastures to reduce their
condition before the pre-mating
flushing-period.
Delay Flock Mating
“Big Billy”: Trials at the
Kybybolite (S.A.) research-
centre show that by delaying
flock-mating for several weeks
it’s possible to increase fat-
lamb production.
Over five years the trials
showed that lambing-results
increased from 103 per cent,
to. 149 per cent, as time of
mating progressed fro m
December to April.
However, the researchers
warn that careful attention
must be given to the length
of the green-feed season, which
must, in the final issue, deter-
mine the latest time of mating.
In the tests the group mated up
to March fattened and sold
well, but those mated in
March-April did not give such
good returns, because a per-
centage had not reached
market-weight by the time
pasture had run to seed. Best
of all was the mid-season flock,
mated in February-March.
Another advantage of later
mating is that lambing takes
place after the break in the
season. With the critical
feeding-time for ewes (those
last six weeks of pregnancy)
largely falling during plentiful
growth of pasture, costly hand-
feeding can be greatly reduced.
Artificial Insemination
“A.C.T.”: Experiments are
starting in Wales aiming to pro-
duce twin calves from Here-
ford beef-cattle by means of
artificial insemination. These
trials will last two years and
involve the treatment of about
2000 cows in the first year. The
idea started from laboratory-
research at Cambridge.
Fly-spray
“Billjim”: Immunity which
the housefly seems to have
built-up to D.D.T. may dis-
appear as soon as a new
American preparation called
Korlan hits the Australian
market.
This phosphate-type insecti-
cide can be used either as a
soluble powder or an emul-
sion-concentrate.
Residual sprays for fly-
control in farmhouses, sheds
and poultry-pens last up to six
weeks. The preparation,
Korlan, should also be effec-
tive as a liquid bait and larvi-
cide.
Farm Hints
“M’Lou”: Wheatbreeding
calls for infinite patience ; at
least 15, sometimes 18, years
must elapse between cross-
pollination to evolve new
varieties and the time when
these can be released in
quantity to farmers^
“C.A.A.”: Trials at
Kybvbolite (S.A.) Research
Station show that at least two
bags an acre of super, are
needed to develop lush pas-
tures on black-soil plains. It
also seems that copper and
zinc are needed in the first and
second years. Adequate stands
can be grown by using 21b. of
clover-seed, with a perennial
grass included in the pasture-
mixture. Very high produc-
tion of pasture will result if
three or four bags of super, are
used. Strawberry-clover is the
best; and zinc and copper
additions should be at the rate
of 71b. an acre.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(18/12/’58.)
Rainfall may be patchy in Queensland during January,
apart from heavy falls on the Peninsula and north-west and
south-west areas. There may be flooding in the south-
western rivers, including the Maranoa and Condamine.
Heavy rains and widespread flooding are likely in February
and March.
In N.S.W. the coastal districts and the tablelands and
n.-w. slopes and plains areas should receive moderate to
good rains during January, although rainfall may be patchy
elsewhere, with good general rains in February. Rainfall
may be patchy in March, with moderate general rains
during April.
There should be good rains in the southern half of
Victoria during * January, with flooding in the southern
rivers. Rainfall may vary from light to moderate in the
northern division, although heavy general rains are likely
in February, with good follow-on rains in March.
The agricultural areas of South Australia should receive
moderate rain in January, though falls may be poor in the
interior. Moderate to heavy rains may occur in the agri-
cultural areas and n.-w. interior during February, and rain-
fall may be patchy and below normal in the pastoral areas
during the year. XT
Moderate rain is likely in the Kimberleys of Western
Australia during January, but poor elsewhere. Reasonably
good rains are likely in the North Kimberleys during
February, but poor elsewhere.

PASTURE-IMPROVEMENT IN PAKISTAN
As an Australian officer of
the U.N. Food and Agri-
culture Organisation, I assisted
in an experiment which could
be of interest to Australians.
Initiated by the Pakistan
Soil Conservation Organisation
from its headquarters in
Quetta, the aim of the project
was stabilisation and fixation
of sand-dunes at Mustung in
the Kalat division of Baluchis-
tan (West Pakistan). Work
started in November, 1954, and
is still in progress.
An area of about 10 acres
was selected. (The first photo-
graph shows the state of this
area before the experiment
started.) In bygone days this
•land had been fertile and pro-
ductive, but sand had gradu-
ally taken the place of soil,
burying all vegetation and half
a village and completely
destroying a karez (waterway).
The experiment was designed
to develop a technique for
stabilising sand - dunes by
immobilisation, as an interim
measure, and then gaining
permanent fixation by sowing
and planting forage-species.
The limiting factor was that
water used for the germination
of seeds or to encourage sur-
vival of any species must
BEFORE
necessarily be obtained only by
natural precipitation.
The area has an altitude of
more than 5000 ft. above sea-
level, and an annual rainfall
of Bin. (Rain, divided about
equally between winter and
summer, is always certain.)
Mean humidity is approxi-
mately 10 per cent,, with an
average wind-velocity of six
knots.
Ail these factors had to be
considered when choosing
species for the experiment,
which had to come from coun-
tries with approximately the
same conditions as Mustung.
Saltbush-seeds (Antriplex nut-
talii) were obtained from Aus-
tralia and Antriplex cane scene
from the U.S.A. When sown,
these both gave a high percen-
tage of germination and sur-
vival and grew vigorously.
Encouraging results were
also obtained with species of
upland or grazing alfalfa
(lucerne) obtained from Aus-
tralia and the U.S.A. Seventy
per cent, germination was
obtained, and practically a full
percentage of survival resulted.
These species flourished with
a satisfying spread and a
vigorous root-growth, proving
the old adage that lucerne will
grow everywhere and any-
where except where it is not
sown, on rock or in the ocean.
Lucerne, because of its high
protein-yield, is a king among
fodders, and its successful
establishment in this experi-
ment was satisfactory to all
responsible and should be of
interest to Australians in simi-
lar areas,
other species, such as
Tamarix gallica, Calligonuni
pholygonoides, Arundo donax
and Sacchamm ciliaro, were
successfully established.
Kochia species of Medicago,
as as some l° ca l herbs,
germinated and spread on the
dunes. Some love-grass, blue-
P an j c and Harding-grass-also
Andropogen species—all ger-
minated with varying percen--
tage and survival-rates, which
were, however, remarkable
enough to make the results
encouraging.
Today practically the whole
10 acres has been covered with
a strong, vigorous growth of
vegetation, which has com-
pletely covered the sand and
AFTER
successfully caused its perman-
ent fixation. (The second
photograph shows this.)
Results obtained made it diffi-
cult to convince some people
that the only moisture used in
the experiment was the natural
rainfall.
Now that the experiment has
succeeded to this point the next
step is to establish the carrying-
capacity of the area. Con-
trolled grazing of the whole
area is to be carried out by
placing various densities of
livestock, sheep and cattle on
equal areas. A useful purpose
will also be served in showing
farmers what happens with
overstocking and uncontrolled
grazing. ,
One of the remarkable
phenomena observed was the
return of birds to the area,
which, before the beginning of
this experiment, was com-
pletely devoid of any form of
bird-life. As the area became
successfully covered with
vegetation, birds returned in
thousands, though where they
came from no one could tell.
The existence of such a green
patch in what was lately a
sandy wilderness brought
pleasure and relief to the drab
and weary lives of the inhabi-
tants. The loyal, 'energetic and
learned co-operation of officers
of the Pakistan Soil Conserva-
tion Organisation was respon-
sible for the success of the
experiment. Agronomists and
forest-officers of this organisa-
tion have few peers anywhere
in the world,
it s h ou i d de appreciated that
grazing has been practised in
this particular area for at least
5000 years, and that it has
probably been overstocked
most of the time. Yet in three
years this experiment demon-
strated how, by introducing
exotic plant-species and also
using some indigenous species,
vegetation can be completely
rejuvenated and an area like
this brought back into produc-
tion.
Perhaps Australia has a
lesson to learn from this.

The guavas should be quite ripe,
and should be gathered on a sunny
day, so that they are quite dry.
Put the fruit into a tub" and bruise
it with a wooden masher. Then
cover it with boiling water, place
a cloth over it to exclude dust and
leave for from one to three weeks,
according to the weather; examine
every few days after the first week,
and do not let mould accumulate.
Strain through a cloth or fine sieve,
and to every gallon of liquor allow
31b. sugar. Stir well together in
a tub, or cask with the bung out,
and let it work for about 10 days.
When it has finished fermenting,
add lOoz. isinglass and raisins
to every nine gallons of the wine,
and let it stand for about six
months, when it may be bottled. It
is better for keeping. A little

General directions for forecasting
the weather at Sydney with an
aneroid barometer ?
The notations “Very Dry,”
“Change,” “Rain,” etc., are useless
as indicators either of present or
future weather. These marks repre-
sent average weather conditions
which prevailed' at the locality
where the instrument was manufac-
tured. But movements are instruc-
tive. A gradual but steady rise
indicates settled fine weather; a very
slow rise from a low point is usually
associated with high winds and
slow i m P lovemen t i n the weather;
a rapid rise generally means high
winds and sharp showers, followed
by fine weather. A rising barometer
usually means wind from a southerly
direction; [n summer, a cool
change; in winter, milder days,
At Sydney, a high barometer with
a south-easterly wind is usually
accompanied by showers; inland,
however, the weather is fine. A
rising barometer with a northerly
wind means a backing or extension
of a high-pressure system and
indicates fine weather. A gradual
but steady fall indicates unsettled
wet weather; a very slow fall from
a high point means wet weather
coming, but little wind; a sharp,
rapid fall indicates strong, squally
winds, heavy showers, or both. A
falling barometer generally indicates
northerly winds and hot weather in
summer, cold in winter. If a baro-
meter is falling., rapidly with a
southerly wind, it shows the
development of a cyclone with
strong winds and rain and possibly
thunder and hail. A steady baro-
meter means little change from
prevailing conditions. In winter, if
weather is fine, frosts are likely,
and, if past weather has been wet,
fogs can be expected. An unsteady
barometer with short, sudden rises
and falls presages thunderstorms.

Some facts about the Archibald
Memorial in Sydney’s Hyde Park ?
J. F. Archibald, who died in 1919,
left a sum of money for the erec-
tion of a bronze memorial, to take
the form of a fduntain, to com-
memorate the association of France
and Australia in World War I. In
accordance with Archibald’s wish
that the work should be done by
a Frenchman, sculptor Francois
Sicard was selected in 1926. B. J.
Waterhouse and Hubert Corlette
collaborated with him in the design
and erection of the architectural
portions of the memorial.
The sculpture of the fountain
consists of a central raised figure,
Apollo, representing the Arts
(Beauty and Light) and, in the
largest basin, three groups, one
depicting Diana, another a young
god of the fields and pastures, and
the third Theseus vanquishing the
Minotaur. The fountain is one of
the best works of sculpture of its
kind in Australia. It was officially
handed over to the citizens of
Sydney by the trustees of Archi-
bald’s. will on March 14, 1933.
Total cost was £12,864,

British Commonwealth, the U.S.A.,
India, France, Turkey, Greece, Bel-
gium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
the Philippines, Ethiopia, Thailand,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway and
Colombia. The Republic of Korea
itself also provided troops, of
course, as did Italy, not then - a
member fo the U.N. (Italy was
admitted in Dec., 1955.) Many
other member-States gave money, or
made contributions in kind.

Some details of ‘‘Bovs’ Town"?
It is a settlement at Engadine, 19
miles by rail south of Sydney, for
delinquent, neglected, unmanageable
and orphaned boys. Modelled on
the community of the same name in
the U.S.A., it was founded in 1939
by Father T. V. Dunlea, its prim
cipal until his retirement in 1951,
and has grown to be a self-
contained township, about 90 acres
in extent, with shops, classrooms
and a hospital, as well as paved
streets, gardens and playing-fields.
The boys are accepted irrespective
of religious belief; in 1954 there
were 110, aged between nine and
15 years. They are encouraged to
become useful members of the com-
munity. The success of Boys’ Town
owes much to the fact that it is
self-governing. Each year the boys


elect from among themselves a
mayor and eight aldermen, and this
council is responsible for the wel-
fare of the citizens, also acting as
a tribunal with the power to impose
penalties for misdemeanors.
Until 1952 brothers of the De
La Salle order were responsible for
education and training, but in that
year the Salesians of Don Bosco
took control. As well as the usual
school-subjects various trades are
taught; the trainees, besides supply-
ing the needs of the township,
produce their own vegetables and
eggs. Up to the end of 1955 about
1800 boys had passed through the
town. It is supported by public
subscription and the contributions
of parents and guardians.

Are wax-candles of ancient
origin ?
Modern candles derive from the
rushlights of ancient times (rushes
soaked in household grease). Bees-
wax-candles have been in use from
early ages, and are mentioned by
Roman writers. Tallow-dips were
used as illuminants through the
Middle Ages. Spermaceti (a white
crystalline wax obtained from the
sperm-whale) came into use for
making candles in the latter half
of the 18th century. [ln 1860 the
(London) Metropolis Gas Act
adopted the sperm-candle as the
“standard candle” in photometry.]
The bulk of modern candles are
made of paraffin-wax (introduced
about 1854), stearine (also intro-
duced during the 19th century), or
a mixture of both.

The Boxing Day meeting at Caulfield
held by the Victorian Amateur Turf
Club gave racegoers a chance to come
out in the gayest summer frocks, for the
day was warm and sunny. The hats

SYDNEY
A quiet week, this, between Christmas
and New Year, a time to reflect what a
happy thing it is that our New Year
lies so close to Christmas, the feast of
the Child. It is the children who make
Christmas a truly joyous time, so it is
fitting that the fresh, hopeful spirit of
the young should carry us over from the
old, tired year to a new beginning.
A little scene in the dusk of the night
before Christmas brought this home to
one just about to despair at the pushing,
the driving, the destruction of once-
beautiful carols, the commercialisation of
Christmas celebrations generally.
But a glimpse through the kitchen-
window showed a golden light thrown
across the passageway between the two
blocks of flats, and, framed in the lighted
window, was a family of New Australians
all working together in preparing beauti-
ful bowls and dishes of colorful foods.
Then down through the dusk of the
passageway flitted two little girls in long
white nightgowns, barefooted, and with
their hair tied-up in top-knots. Their
laughter came in trills and ripples as they
spun by, peeped into the lighted window,
and disappeared around the corner of the
building. Then followed a two-year-old
boy in red-striped pyjamas, almost spin-
ning like a willy-willy with excitement,
laughter tinkling from him as though he
Were clad in bells.
As he, too, disappeared, leaving
behind him a cadenza of echoing
laughter, the remembrance of the old
Christmas feeling came freshly renewed.
It cannot be destroyed while children
retain their sense of wonder.
One little three-year-old, asked by her
parents what she wanted for Christmas,
replied mysteriously: “I want a door that
opens.” Did she know that her wish
was a symbol for the universal longing
for goodwill among men? Probably not,
but if we can give her what she wants
and go into the coming year with
unshuttered doors and hearts, it will
indeed be a happy New Year.
And as this is the time for children, so
it is naturally the time for children’s
entertainment. Sydney is rich in offering
at the moment. Pantomimes, of course,
are the traditional fare. At the Tivoli
there’s a “Cinderella” that is as spectacu-
lar and noisy as any child could wish, with
a Cinders who has plenty of vitality (a
change from the usual namby-pamby
doll), a Buttons with good clowning
ability, and a marvellous transformation-
scene from the castle-kitchen to fairy-
land.
There are few children who do not
thoroughly enjoy panto; their delight is
expressed so vigorously and obviously.
This Letter, however, introduced a seven-
year-old this year whose reaction was a
little away from the normal. He was
amused at the excellent tumbling on
roller-skates of the Ugly Sisters ; eager to
catch the lollies that just fell short of
the Dress Circle (though he was given
some by Buttons himself at Interval);
couldn’t understand why Prince Charm-
ing was a girl; but didn’t really become
enthralled until the community song:
“Why does a red cow give white milk
when she always eats green grass?” was
sung by one and all. “Do you know why
she does?” he asked, and listened keenly
to find the answer. Having sung with
the others, he said: “We didn’t find out,
did we?” and on the way home remarked
suddenly, “Would it be because she eats
white flowers, too?” Of course he didn’t
get a satisfactory answer from a tired
auntie, so on arriving home he greeted
his father with: “Daddy, do you know
why a red cow gives white milk, etc.?”
Auntie fled just as Daddy started, “Well,
you see, son, everything we eat....” He
was not the panto type, obviously.
Dorothea Dowling, whose latest book
of verse was published in London by the
Guild Poets, has received news that the
whole edition was sold out within three
weeks. This is her fifth book of verse
and the second which she has written in
collaboration with her sister Mavis. She
and Mavis will set sail by Strathaird in
April for a visit to Europe, America and
Canada. They will seek inspiration and
material for their books and will attend
the annual congress in London of the
Imperial Ballet Society, of which they are
members. They will return home at the
end of the year. Nicolai Ross photo.
“Alice in Wonderland,” at the Phillip
Street Theatre, is a gentler type of enter-
tainment for the children at this time,
and it is presented with excellent taste.
Dawne McFarlane as Alice, dressed in
floating pink and blue silk, is the epitome
of the child’s ideal of prettiness, and
Kevin Brennan’s Humpty-Dumpty (as
well as his Queen of Hearts) is an excel-
lent study. As nearly all children know
Alice both in Wonderland and Through
the Looking Glass, they are not mystified
by Mock Turtles and Lobster Quadrilles,
or applause being suppressed by having a
cloth thrown over it. There is a little
audience-participation in “Alice” when
the children sing a jolly song: “Shake
Hands and How-do-you-do,” but there
is nothing like the noise that accompanies
the panto, so it’s easier on the adults
present. Also, it does not ask awkward
questions like “How does a red cow,
etc.?”
The Tintookies, at the Conservatorium
—those tiny puppet-people created by
Peter Scriven—are part of a delightful
Australian story this year, “Little Fella
Bindi.” It is about an aboriginal boy
who is the last of his tribe. He tries to
make friends with the animals, koalas,
wombats, possums, an emu and a bad-
tempered cocky, but hunger drives him to
go hunting, and he nearly kills one of his
friends. The story is geared to childish
understanding, and there are some lively
little songs, especially those sung by the
cockatoo. It is to be thoroughly recom-
mended.
One complaint to be made about the
children's entertainment at the moment
is that interval refreshments seem exces-
sive in price. Ice-cream buckets, for
instance, are Is. each, which is well-nigh
prohibitive when there'are four or five
kiddies in the party. At the Con. there
are no sweets, drinks or ice-creams for
sale at all. It is probably a house-rule,
but as the nearest shop is way, way
along Macquarie Street, it is rather hard
on the kiddies.
While on the subject of children, one
may as well bring-up a matter that has
been on the tip of the pen for some time,
though it does strike a rather sour note.
It is that children on push-bikes, no
matter how young, how irresponsible or
how inexperienced, may take the road
with motorists and transport of every
kind, without having to undergo any
kind of test of competency.
Isn’t it time that some sort of examina-
tion should precede the use of bicycles
by youngsters, so that one can be sure
that they know the rules of, the road at
least? And should not some age-limit
be set? It is a paradox that adults have
to get a licence before taking a car on
the roads, but it is not considered neces-
sary for children on bikes.

changed each year, and it can hardly
be denied that on the whole the series
has given a pretty fair picture of what
has been written.
The real feeling behind the minds of
the editors of this Adelaide anthology
must be not that these things are not
happening, but that they are not
) happening in Adelaide. And so this
is an attempt to make them happen in
Adelaide.
It is an attempt which seems to this
reviewer at once perilous and admir-
able: perilous because it really would
not do the cause of Australian poetry
any good to weaken the position of
Angus and Robertson’s anthology—•
rather it should be strengthened—
admirable because it is an expression
of regional energy. Both causes would
probably best be served if the South
Australians could produce a really
strong anthology of their own writing,
which could serve as a contributory
stream to the existing central
anthology; but that must await a
greater body of strong writing.
On its present principle of selection,
which is to avoid writing that has
appeared in other anthologies (though
a few well-known pieces have crept in),
the anthology has no hope of improv-
ing on “Australian Poetry”: all it can
do is cover much the same ground, with
the chance of varying the picture and
correcting an occasional injustice, and
with the danger of becoming merely a
collection of minor pieces.
The present collection is, in fact,
chiefly of minor poems many
reprinted from “The Bulletin” —and its
most clearly discernible “trend,” apart
from some natural emphasis on South
Australian writers, is a broad concept
of poetry and a response to country
charm. Two out-of-the-way contribu-
tions, illustrating this freshness of view-
point, are “Tamparlooitimo’s Lament,”
a translation of a poem by an aboriginal
woman reprinted from “The Bulletin,”
and Brian Medlin’s gay and musical
little “Song”:—
The rains have come in the middle
of June
To save the season and none too
soon
Off the back of the hand of a wind
that flurries
The green pepper-tree and the red
pepper-berries.
With this sort of note running through
it, and with most of the well-known
writers of the day represented, it makes
a pleasant book to read. It is published
by “Australian Letters” (Da Costa
Building, Adelaide), and the editors are
Robert Clark, Geoffrey Dutton, Max
Harris and lan Mudie.
As You Were
In his little book The Making of the
Australians (Georgian House), A. E.
Mander is early at great pains to prove
that by 1868 descendants of convicts
represented about one per cent, of the
total population—“today, of course
[the percentage] would be infinitesi-
mal.”
He makes a point about the sardonic
casualness of the Australian that one
does not remember, having seen stated
quite so definitely before: —
Less than in any other country of
the world is it true, in inland Aus-
tralia, that “As a man soweth he shall
reap.” And thus, from... .a country
in which so much always depends on
“the luck of the season,” there was
bound to develop a corresponding
outlook in the minds of the people.
On the Australianness of New Aus-
tralians, he adopts a “Bulletin” test of
1887; those who
leave behind them the class-distinc-
tions and political feuds and religious
differences of the Old World, and
who place the happiness and
advancement of their adopted
country first, are Australians.
But he thinks the old Australian
characteristics are changing. This is
partly because rural Australians have
dropped from 44 per cent, in 1871 to
15 per cent, in 1954. The unions, he
considers, have killed the tradition that
an Australian can turn his hand to
anything; and “the popular press, the
cinema, broadcasting and television”
are developing a “mass-mind”: —
All the pressure is on —from the
press, from the church, from com-
mercial radio, from television, from
Hollywood, from advertisers, and
from Ihe crowd —to stamp out all
individuality of taste, in favor of
mass vogue and fashion ; to stamp
out all independent thinking, in favor
of the parroting of ready-made
opinions pumped into the mass-mind.
Of Jellyfish and Men
A fascinating but somewhat humili-
ating item in the latest batch of
Penguins is A Guide to Earth His-
tory, by Richard Carrington. It is
disconcerting to know that the 17th-
century Irish Archbishop James Usher
was mistaken when he found that the
earth was created on Saturday, October
22, 4004 B.C. at eight-o’clock in the
evening.
According to Richard Carrington,
modern scientific opinion, based on
observation, puts the age of our planet
at 3,000,000,000 years. If the whole
of earth’s history were compressed into
a single year we lords of creation
would have strutted onto the stage at
11.45 p.m. on December 31, so that
the age of written history would have
occupied little more than the last 60
seconds. So Shakspeare said better
than he knew when he spoke of Man’s
“brief hour.”
It is humbling to know that, accord-
ing to Carrington, man’s remotest pro-
genitor could have been a jellyfish
who had evolved from a piece of sea-
weed, which in turn evolved from the
accidental union of two chemicals—•
Carrington can find no hard-and-fast
division between the organic and the
inorganic. It seems that the behavior
of crystals fulfils every item in the
specification of the various qualities of
living things except memory and
intelligence, and for all we know,
stones have those attributes, too. Walls
have ears, according to Shakspeare.
Man’s earliest ancestor was prob-
ably a marine plant which in the course
of 300,000,000 years of trial and error
evolved into a fish. For another
100,000,000 years the fishes were the
lords of creation, though they perished
by the million whenever a tidal wave
or an eruption threw them up on the
lifeless dry land. It never entered the
heads of the fishes that life could be
any different until some individual
member of the species thought of the
idea of converting its gills into lungs
and thus could draw oxygen directly
from the air instead of indirectly
through the water. As a result,
another 100,000,000 years saw 40-ton
dinosaurs roaming the country eating
the plants which had adapted them-
selves to a land life in much the same
manner.
The dinosauri ruled the roost for
another 100.000.000 years and expected
to go on ruling it for ever. Bigness was
their criterion of beauty, goodness and
right thinking. When, however, an
Ice Age caused the food-supply to
dwindle they countered this threat to
their existence in terms of their tradi-
tion by getting bigger, culminating in
Tyrannus rex, a frightful brute 45ft.
from bow to transom with a pair of
useless forearms and a mouthful of
teeth 6in. long with which to deal with
its favorite diet, which was Stego-
saurus, a 10-ton horror with thicker
armor than a knight of the Middle
Ages. At that time if a dinosaurus
more intelligent than its fellows had
suggested that it might be wiser to get
smaller instead of bigger he would
promptly have been called a bourgeois
decadent and been liquidated; but,
just as the armored knight of the
Middle Ages was exterminated by the
leather-jerkined bowman, so Tyranno-
saurus was extinguished by a smaller
creature which ran about on all-fours
and didn’t need a dozen dinosauri to
keep him going.
It is chastening to know, on Carring-
ton’s evidence, that 100,000,000 years
after the disappearance of Tyranno-
saurus, Homo sapiens is in a similar
crisis and is manipulating it in the


same way. Every nation that can
afford to is building space-ships and
atomic-bombers and calling what they
are doing defence and what their
neighbors are dorng aggression. The
Russians call themselves Communists
but are doing precisely the same as all
the others; they are building armies and
guided-missiles and calling them bul-
warks against aggression. In short.
they are all trying to manipulate the .
crisis in the way their tradition taught
them. But so did the dinosaurs, and
there are no dinosaurs any longer—
the little lizard which is chirruping
on my ceiling is the modern representa-
tive of the 80ft. brontosaurus. As
Carrington says, none of these reptiles
could know that their very concentra-
tion on size and ferocity was leading
inevitably to their own destruction.
However, Homo sapiens has some
cause to be thankful. Instead of
developing out of Pithecanthropus
erectus he might have emerged along
the lines of diplocaulus. Dip was an
amphibian whose anatomy was so
bizarre and extraordinary that “we can
be sure that it was an overspecialised
and degenerate form—a bad evolu-
tionary joke, living without hope of
readapting itself to the main stream of
progress.”
Here. I fancy, Carrington goes be-
yond the data. There is no inherent
reason why some genius of the species
couldn’t have started diplocaulus off in
a more prolific direction; in which case
our standard of beauty would not be
the glamorous Sabrina but a creature
looking like a cross between a tailless
aircraft and a boomerang flattened in
the middle. All standards of beauty are
associationally determined. —M.G. S,

Oh, is he dead then, the one that you did
love?
The one whose name you called me in
that act
resembling joy, denying me-and-you?
Remembrance then is fact.
Was he so wonderful, your lover-boy?
I hope so, since you call me by his name.
Was he a cocksure lover of the act,
or was he young and tame?
No, don’t explain. Explaining’s never

And 1 have secrets that I did not share —

name.

THE EVENING CALM
In love’s half-light
Where we lie between sunstroke and mid-
night,
In that soft moment when your head
Has no weight on the pillow, and the bed
No wood nor iron, rather boat-timbers
calm
On the sea, how could these bodies intend
us harm?
And yet a thought,
Like a gull on the rigging, is not caught.
When our four giving hands grow mean,
It hints, and age turns your warm, brown
eyes green,
When we regard our bodies with occa-
sional malice,
If at all—what will love be, when come
to this?
Neither of us
Likes calm seas more than impetuous,
Nor would we ever wish to betray
These friends who’ve swum and dived
together, and say
They did not introduce us each to each.
Our souls grew wiser while our lips could
teach.
When one of us tires
Gulls will fly screaming from desire's
Black squall. But that can never be
While soul and body are like the wind
and sea.
Our netting senses that rocks tear, storms
spin,
Draw the sea’s hazards. Our hands still
haul them in.

FIRETAIL FINCHES
Such flashing joy of flower and feather
Over the rock and wiki creek-water,
Such ragged scrub and such confusion
Of perching green and flying crimson
Where bottlebrushes tweak themselves
Clean off the twigs with scarlet tails
And finches dart and take their places
Like crimson blossoms on the bushes
And sing in sunlight—it is dear
This joy in Nature does not care
Whether it breaks in bottlebrush clump
Or small bird’s beak or small bird's rump
But out it must and up it creeps
Till both burn crimson at the tips.

WHALE
If we regard the fountain of the whale
Spouting in these bright, temperate seas,
from cliff
Or bowsprit; if we see the island of its
bulk,
A new promised land exciting lubber’s
talk
Of blubber steaks, and how they’d land
it, if
Given a boat, harpoon, or salt for its tail:
We perceive the ponderables in life
Are left to the crab-pincer minds of men
—No wider than a match-stick —to
dissect.
Nations of crab-armies to inspect
The.wrecked whale and, piecemeal, to ken
Its composition, analyse it, safe
From a sudden synthesis. Oh Whale!
Oh world !
If each god-monster was in one question
hurled.
