Thre e Spring Poets
The Red Wage
In the spring a publisher lightly turns to
thoughts of verse. He is out to catch the
Christmas buyer of presents—and a slim
book of something that looks like poetry, or,
maybe, is poetry, cheaply solves his diffi-
culty. Here are four to choose from.*
E. J. Rupert Atkinson aroused the in-
terest of this page by the publication of his
big volume of verse, By a Midnight Sea, in
which there were poetic imagination, much
passion and lyrical fervor and a high tech-
nical skill, the whole weakened by the
author’s incoherence and his lack of artis-
tic restraint. In Wayside Poems there is
more thought and ampler originality of
treatment, but he has not emancipated him-
self from his loose lavishness of epithet,
and he still is captivated by the meaningless
resonance of a phrase. He remains a limp-
ing poet; his verse, packed with passion, is
crudely put together. His ‘'Melbourne
Sonnets” are turgid but powerful, cata-
loguing details instead of swiftly glimpsing
their essence. Yet they belong to the mod-
ern school, and Atkinson’s partial failure is
worth more than many a minor Australian
poet’s easy success in more conventional
themes. Though his volume has other in-
teresting things in it, this collection of
sonnets gives it its only value. Three
samples of his somewhat jumpy sonnets
follow, though they are technically merely
14-lined stanzas of verse:—
AT FLEMINGTON.
Degrade yourself to this with feverish drink,
Sustained by bandy tales of urban wit;
This gay environment is surely fit.
Invidious females, decked in white and pink,
Green, blue and scarlet, all grimacing,
think,
Poor dolls! that they are happy—hag and
chit.
Their mindless menfolk wager, drawl,
smoke, spit,
And talk their twaddle, roar, and grin and
wink.
Gubernatorial pomp's their bait, no doubt —
Spice for their savagery. Who's squared
what horse
Pricks them to serious thought. The loud
bands blare
Mingling with yells of jockey, bookie, tout,
Till the rush of hooies along the matted
course
Holds every gaze beneath the vernal glare.
ON THE BLOCK.
Whirled in a shimmer of muslin, satin, lace,
They chatter, laugh and smile; their radi-
ance glows,
And from their loveliness a fragrance blows,
Which deifies each mystic, girlish face.
Here's more than magic! In every coy
grimace,
A glove's half-gesture, the tilting of a nose,
There lightens something from each dainty
pose,
Some startled sweetness of elusive grace.
Observe them thus in splendor—yet they
walk
No less in nakedness though pads complete
Their glittering, fluttering raiment —nearer
gaze
Deep through their warm, white skin; watch
how they stalk;
Stiff bones, automatons of what they eat—
Who live —and live but while their flesh
decays.
IN THE BANK.
Out of the dead cathedral, where dead saints
Mark for untold contempt worn, sorry tales
Mumbled by fatted priests, whose boast be-
wails
Earth, so its part—their creed —that gray
church taints
Me with sepulchral care, till pleasure faints,
Limp under suckling grief. Away from
this !
Out in the town's live turmoil, all remiss,
Is nobler than such prolix grandeur paints.
Here in this sacred place God is secure!
His golden blood hence, here, and hither
drugs
Life. Ships, lands, cables, railways, roads,
entice
Spoil to this great hushed temple; men im-
mure
Their sons, all future hope here; here Death
hugs,
Slimes, and devours their gluttony and vice.
In his introduction to A Modern Magda-
lene, the same author rather unnecessarily
defends his physical treatment of his theme
—a modern presentation of the old legend
of the monk and the courtesan, who, each
swearing to convert the other, were both
painfully successful, the woman taking to
the ascetic life and the man becoming a fallen
Wowser. “Decadence ih art tends to anti-
cipate and prevent decadence in action,
against excess in which —in luxury and in
pleasure—decadent art may be said to vac-
cinate u 5.... If a drinking-song suggests
convivialism it justifies itself, since it is
nevertheless a real substitute for the unreal
and demoralising intoxication of the flowing
b0w1....1t is well within the proper scope
of art and poetry to produce the effect of
beauty by an elaborate representation of
that which is hideous and vile” All anci-
ent platitudes, having nothing to do with
Atkinson’s performance. .. .much smoke to
a tiny camp fire. His story of the Mel-
bourne Flossie and the converted Wowser is
realistically told, with all the sensual
adornments necessary, but it is mere pic-
turesque narrative, not poetry. His manner
is pretentious, Correllian. ler as narrative
it is admirably done. Atkinson has not
mastered this form, though in his “Mel-
bourne Sonnets” he has more attempted and
more achieved.
A more sedate and serious muse is
Frederick T. Macartney's. The author of
Dewed Petals aims high in his “theme in
sonnets,” Earthen Vessels. He attempts the
dissection of love in an Australian setting,
following, at a discreet distance, the example
of Meredith in Modern Love. Macartney
is technically better equipped than Atkin-
son. His command of language and his care
of phrase place him close to O’Dowd ; but he
has not such close-fibred thought-stuff
wherewith to weight his verses. His cul-
tured style will please where Atkinson's
youthful incoherence merely attracts. His
sonnets are admirable examples of balanced
structure; and his theme is carefully
handled and held throughout. He has, too,
an appreciation of Australian atmosphere.
But his work lacks flame: he leaves only
a red glow of cinders... .pleasant to warm
one’s hands at.
In Julian Mitchell, author of By Suns
and Stars, we welcome the West. In him
Westralia finds careless voice. He is youth-
ful and robust, lavish and crude, optimistic
and Westralian. He can write admirably
in a sonnet that, characteristically, begins
with a line that is a foot short
At last! The Awakening of Australia!
At least this is what The Standard Publish-
ing Co. Pty. Ltd. (Melb.) calls it in its
beautiful prospectus of the publication of
“The Standard Australian Poets.” “Poets
and writers are arising,” we are informed.
“An Australian literature is being formed.”
Perhaps you have suspected that something
of this kind has happened. Well, yon now
have it on the authority of the Standard
Publishing Pty. Co., whose governing direc-
tor is Thomas C. Lothian. “Hitherto the
voice of the Poets of Australia has been
heard only in isolated Songs—a Poet sing-
ing here, a Poet singing there—no attempt
having been made to bring the works of
different poets together and to evolve from
them one great Poetic harmony. And
yet it is only by the doing of this- that the
aspirations of the people of Australia can
become articulate,” etc. And: “To meet
this great national need it has been deter-
mined to select the best and most significant
writings of those Poets who voice most
clearly the aspirations of Australia.” The
“best and most significant” poets thus se-
lected are seven: Lawson, O’Dowd, McCrae,
Gay, Williamson, Hervey and Cassidy ; and
from these seven the Standard Publishing
Co. will presumably evolve one great poetic
harmony. Thus Hervey will harmonise with
O’Dowd, and Cassidy will chant in unison
with McCrae. And it will not be possible to
resolve the chords of this poetic choir, for
“the volumes will not be sold separately.”
The subscription price for the whole cageful
of best and most significant songbirds will
be 32s. 6d. cash, or 37s. 6d. on terms. And
with each set is presented a large photo-
gravure reproduction of Longstaff’s portrait
of Lawson. Also, the series will include two
new Lawson books. Triangles of Life, and
Other Stories, republished from The Bul-
letin, and For Australia, and Other Poems,
chiefly from the columns of this paper.
These will be issued only toi subscribers.
And this, in the words of the modest pub-
lishers, is “the first adequate collection of
Australian Poetry issued in any part of
the world.” Curious. Here another Aus-
tralian publisher advertises his series of
Australian poets. It includes 13 volumes,
and the names are: Paterson, Brunton
Stephens, Daley, Evans, Ogilvie, Lawson,
Boake and Farrell, with The Golden Trea-
sury of Australian Verse added. And, once
upon a time, didn’t The Bulletin do some-
thing in the way of publishing Australian
poets? The Standard Publishing Co. merely
joins the procession at the tail-end; but it
is pleasing to note that that firm has at
length awakened to the fact that there is a
procession. .
P. P. Howe, in a brilliant article upon
Granville Barker’s plays in the latest
Fohtnigiitly, makes a neat thrust at an
old stage convention :—
We shall not fully understand the maetery this
dramatist has over the technique of his art until
we have compared him with others. Ibsen himself
may be caught hammer in hand in the act of “driv-
ing home a point” ; telling us something we must
not miss, that is to say, with an emphasis that does
his belief in us, and in the art of the theatre, no
service. Over and over again in Waste there are
things to be told just as essential to the play’s
understanding, and the dramatist is so secure of our
attention that he has to give it no more than the
delicatest flick. There comes, “But since Mrs. O’Con-
nell is dead, what is the excuse for a scandal?”—
and that is all we know, and all we need to know.
There was a time in the English theatre, not so long
ago, when the information, lest we overlooked it,
would have been given to us in this fashion:-—
Lord Cantelupe : But since Mrs. O’Connell
Farrant: Mrs. O’Connell?
Cantelupe: -is dead
Farrant : Dead!
Lord Horsham 1
Blackborough f {together) : Dead I
.Wedgecroft J
Farrant : Mrs. O’Connell dead 1
Cantelupe : what is the excuse for a scandal ?
For the technical improvement, at least, in the
contemporary English drama, the credit is more Mr.
Granville Barker’s than any other man’s.
James Bryce puts forth his University
and Historical Addresses, delivered while
British Ambassador in the United States
(Macmillan, per Sydney Book Club, 10s.
6d.). Many of his lectures are on American
themes, and therefore of only secondary
interest to Australians ; but his remarks on
Universities and other more general modern
topics are characterised by sound horse-
sense and a stimulating literary style.
Wayside Poems, by E. J. Rupert Atkinson
(MeEwan, Stephens and Stillwell, Melb.; 25.).
A Modern Magdalene, by E. J. Rupert Atkinson
(same publishers and price).
Earthen Vessels, by Frederick T. Macartney
(Specialty Press, Melb. ; Is. 6d.).
By Suns and Stars, by Julian Mitchell (Whit-
combe and Tombs, Melb.; 55.).
The content and the value of Macartney’s
thought may be appraised by these three
sonnets: —
As one, hid in a cloister's columned shade,
May watch clear tapers lighted, till there
shine
Forth from hushed glooms the sacramental
sign,
And, led to vespers by the stately, staid
Abbess, come novices, some half-afraid
In the awed silence that about a shrine
Breathes benediction, stronger with the fine
Sense of their vestal virtue, haring prayed —
So —when to the wide fane of this Austral
night
The chaste moon leads her stars, pale, hesi-
tant —
I watch a silver cross, slow-perfected,
Gleam in the deepening sky-blue e'er more
bright;
And round me, tvhile bland winds in tree-
tops chant
Smooth psalms, I feel the peace of worship
spread.
Hate of the harlot city drives me far
Into the wilderness, that I may there
Be fed as by the heaven-sent birds, and share
The prophecy of wind and flower and star.
Each smoke-stripe on the sky is as a scar.
Sceptic, I sicken in a nauseous air
Heavy with incense of the rue men bear
To grimy naves, whose altars engines are.
Chill shell from which the life has perished,
creed
Houses but echoing ritual, tvhile men buy
Life cheaply, absolved by surpliced blas-
phemy.
The chaplet chinks with minted coinage,
greed
Fingering a frozen heart-drop every bead:
Torn sects connive, their covenant a lie.
Comes summer: where the ravished boree
boughs
Hang their spoilt leafage, ludicrously rank,
Black choughs, red-eyed, a mournful choir
in rank,
Wail low. like grief that pity cannot rouse;
Grotesque, the mailed gohanna crawls to
drowse
Where all else faints; beneath the mounded
bank
Still cattle cluster round a boggy tank;
Sheep seek the shade a box-clump barely
allows.
Red flats of fire where spring was green, a
dull
Dearth of dry grail where little daisies
were;
Far tree-lines swim, a salamandrine blur;
Night cheats a malice it can not annul.
A languid moon, voluptuously full
Wastes while the wagtail boldly flatters
her.
Such work commends itself. Macartney
is never unworthy of the high solemnity of
his Muse; he gives to his verse a loving
care and a patient laboring of the file. Had
he but a vitality that would lead him to a
larger carelessness, had he an inspiration
worthy of the casket he has so chastely
decorated, he would rank high in our Aus-
tralian choir.
Now is the season of the corn and fruits,
The grape voluptuous, with amber beads,
The pencilled peaches and the purple plums;
Now is the triumph of the tawny roots;
Now is the fullness of-the striving seeds;
And sweated man into his harvest comes.
He is youthfully alliterative and youth-
fully alive. He is aflame with patriotism,
and pleasantly puts his state into easy
verse:—
The earth in mighty straining sweated gold,
The shackled sea in sympathy wept gems,
That he who came a-wooing might behold
Her crested with a thousand diadems.
And she was ribbed with wondrous ores and
steel,
And rooted to the universal heart,
That all the burden of a commonweal
Might find her trussed secure in every
part ....
She spread a sun-tanned wilderness to test
The merits of her kind, and forests deep
In sleuth to urge them on her rugged quest
That leads for ever to the upward steep.
She swung the sharp-edged arougni across
their fields,
And scathed their flocks with desolating
s word:
She hit their crops and pinched their lavish
yields
Of corn to strengthen them before the Lord.
She sucked the waters of their springs, and
set
A false mirage upon the changing sands;
The elements assailed, but, loving yet,
She worked new wonders in their lonely
lands ....
The silent desert quivers with her songs,
The barren boulders break in martial
strains,
When to the roll of Heaven’s tliund'rous
gongs
The firmament dissolves in luscious rains;
While secret seeds warm to her mother-feel,
And rear their tribute in a green array,
And the torn places of her body heal
With fragrant unguents that defy decay.
Then on the murmur of the crowded leaves
She blows the trumpet note of hope, and
calls
Her weary legion to the clustering sheaves
That gather fieldwards as the harvest
falls
You who have spoken her on lonely trails,
Where nothing is and everything begins....
You who have sat with her on evenings grey,
When the lost stars lit hurried lamps above ,
And timid torrents whined their rocky
way —
Has she unbosomed aught to you but
love?....
In the rich current of her tawny fleece,
In the excess and riot of her gold,
In her wide acres’ bearing and increase,
She pays the claims of love a thousandfold.
It is for the few' poems of this order,
hymning the inchoate hopes of the West,
that By Suns and Stars is welcome. The
rest of the book is filled with various herse.
Literature and the Bush
“Leo Leai 1 ” has his say:—
1 notice some scribes are Aboriginallegui-
ing to the effect that the bushie oi' to-day is
deteriorating in literature and general
knowledge. Are they comparing him with
his prototype of past decades, who often
bougnt books by the gallon merely to fill the
shelf and give the house an intellectual ap-
pearance V If so, let me examine the posi-
tion, first allowing the ancient cove the
benefit of the doubt of reading all the works
he collected. I presume each absorbed the
qualities under question from, in his youth,
education ; and, in after life, reading. Again
I presume the former source has advanced
100 per cent, on the old swallow it or get
whacked methods t>f former days, and fhat
the subject matter of works perused by
ancient bushies are soaked up by the mod-
ern type, but with this difference. The
works of to-day are up to this year’s stan-
dard of knowledge, and in many cases com-
pletely revolutionise the views expounded
30 years ago. My experience is that the
man under review reads as much now as
ever he did, and with the greater advan-
tages I hold he can't have gone backwards.
As for “penny dreadfuls." they are simply
like measles, or conversion, or 14-year-old
love, a part of life we come up to and get
over, like the day of our birth. Now I con-
tend that the normal bushman —the free,
hard-working, don’t-care-a-blank, . roving
good mate that can be found anywhere
from the suburban boundary to the rim of
things, is in general knowledge easily ahead
of the average townie, the equally indepen-
dent cove, who after working-hours picture
shows or football barracks. It may not be
the latter’s fault, because his views are
bounded by streets and bricks, and he hasn’t
much of a chance to expand beyond his
day’s needs. The former, by the very
nature of his environs, should get a broader
view of life. Take the spare time of each.
The bushie reads, and in his camp you find
the leading weeklies, illustrated magazines,
the latest novels and cheap editions of clas-
sical works. Also books of “Home Univer-
sity Library,” and “Rational Press Associa-
tion.” You will find these latter sixpennies
spreading far and wide. Now the townie
has no time for the above. The girl wants
to see the pictures, and Glebe or Fitzroy
must be encouraged on Saturdays with ex-
pectorations. cheers, and “’struths.” Ilis
life is chock up without it, and he sees the
world’s doings pass on and off the white
screen, or skims them in short pars in the
daily press. These haven’t time to make
much impression before they must make way
for the next; whereas, with the country
cove, he often has to absorb his knowledge
three or four times over, because the new
supply is blocked by fire, water, pirates, or
acts of God, as the steamers put it. Any-
how the two most ignorant men I ever met
were townies. One held the world was
flat, and the other that Joseph Hocking
was the greatest novelist since the days
when Moses wrote his romances.
Sonneteers are reminded that the compe-
tition for the best sonnet on our Australian
October ends on November 3. Entries must
be addressed to this page.
Flapperature or Teen-Fiction —the sort of
novel that the Nice Girl likes to read —is
almost a monopoly in the hands of Aus-
tralian woman writers. Ethel Turner,
Lilian Turner, Vera G. Dwyer, Mary Grant
Bruce are names popular with female kids
from the age of seven to 17. Two
of the latest Ward. Lock volumes are Stair-
ways to the Stars, by Lilian Turner; and
With Beating Wings, by Vera G. Dwyer—•
both very naive and simple and innocuously
romantic and nicely sentimental. In the
Kid category the same firm forward two
other volumes, Norah of Billabong, by Mary
Grant Bruce : and The Childhood of Helen,
by Evelyn Goode. The illustrations, though
possessing a rudimentary sense of Austra-
lian atmosphere, are quite lacking in charm.
Surely our Australian flappers dress with a
little more style? Apparently the illustrator
has never seen a Nice Flapper in all her
glory. The fully arrayed Flapper is Aus-
tralia’s most distinctive primary product or
national industry.

20 GAUGE, MODEL 1912
Hammerless
Repeating Shotgun
If you have ever used a light gun in
hunting, you will at once appreciate the
advantages of the Model 1912 Hammer-
less Repeating Shotgun. This new
Winchester weighs only 5% pounds —
about the weight of a .22 caliber rifle —
yet it is the strongest repeating shotgun
on the market, because, unlike others, its
metal parts throughout are made of
Nickel Steel. This lightness and strength
are combined with great beauty of out-
line and perfection of balance and finish.
Its action is positive and works with an
ease and smoothness not found in
other guns. It can be taken apart
and put together quickly and easily,
and in strong and accurate shoot-
ing qualities is fully up to the
high Winchester standard.
Go to a dealer and ask him
to show you one of them.
Always use Winchester
ammunition in Win-
chester guns as they are
made for each other.

Let Me Rid You of Your
VARICOSE VEINS
If you suffer from Varicose Veins or Ulcers, or both, I believe that I can
completely cure you. I have treated hundreds of terrible cases with the
utmost success, and I know that but very few cases are really incurable.
\ ery few doctors tell you they can cure this trouble. They prefer to ignore
it. Doctors could not cure me. I cured myself. I then cured my friends,
and then made hundreds of new friends by curing people who had suffered in
some cases for a quarter of a century. Hence I believe I can cure you.
It will pay you well to fully investigate my method. My treatment is applied at your own
home, and docs not require you to lay up, and is painless and harmless. The worst cases usually
respond inside the first few weeks, and old, stubborn cases are perfectly cured under a suitable
course of treatment. GUARANTEE GIVEN IN EVERY CASE ACCEPTED.
Gi\ eme full details of your case. If I can cure you 1 will say so, and send you a guarantee.
You run no imk. Vou can lose nothing if I should fail; but 1 have built up a large business
—not on failures, but on successes in cases formerly given up as hopeless. Let me send you
hundreds of grateful testimonials.
WE WJLL SEND YOU SCORES OF LETTERS LIKE THE FOLLOWING:
Manager Vecsey Varix-ariuni, Rathscar, Vic., June 9, 1913.
Dear Sir, After twenty-four years' suffering from bad varicose veins,
your treatment has given me back the use of my legs, comfortable and free
from pain, and my gratitude can be better imagined than described. Since
beginning the treatment, and ever since I completed if, I have noticed a vast
difference in m.v heart action; my circulation is greatly improved, and I feel
better in every respect. Prior to the treatment, my heart was very bad. There
is ho doubt that the treatment is not only harmless, but it is wonderful as
well —Yours gratefully, V. J. JARDINE.

Too pure, too sweet, too wonderful to last.

Where twain we dwell.

Did Conscience shriek its wrath, its wrath

And rue we urned.
And scattered to the winds of Fate to blow ;

woe.
But: only room for joy. and great disdain

But all in vain!

That seers call caution, and the sight to see
The stodgy terrors of the days-to-be.

The Present Hour in mind, and so was

And scarlet-clad.

Too pure your love to bear such obloquy.

To lead you through the grey mists of

To that high, far-off portal where we met.

The Way at Sea.
If you ’ave a lovin’ son
Wants to go to sea,
You may take advice from one
Oo’s been there, like me.
Take ’im gentle by the ear,
Learn ’im cheap wot I learned dear,
Let ’im 'ark and make ’im ’ear
Wot he’ll get and be.
Tucker bad and worse ’n that
Does for Jack, A.B.
Tough, salt horse an’ greasy fat
Is the fare at sea.
Rancid pork an’ “Harriet Lane,”
Coffee like diluted rain,
Biscuits beyond breakin’ strain
(Weevils thrown in free).
Food you wouldn’t give to hogs
Does for seamen yet.
Housed as you don’t kennel dogs,
Dirty, cramped an’ wet.
Work and watch twelve hours a day,
Work you must an’ sleep you may,
All to earn the nigger’s pay
That the seamen get.
Logged and fined for word or look,
Five bob off yer pay.
Bad discharge sheet in your book,
On your pay-off day.
If the mate should damn your eyes
You must not express surprise,
Never let your anger rise,
Or your temper fray.
If you’ve luck, and year by year
Dodge your death at sea,
What’s the end to which you steer
Lab’ring heavily?
When the nerve and muscle fail
Seamen, crippled, old and frail,
Beg, or starve, or go to jail—
Choose atween the three.
If you ’ave a lovin’ son
Wants to go to sea,
’Ere’s the lastest word o’ one
’Oo’s ’ad some—that’s me —
Let ’im trade in boots or beef,
Be a ploughboy, hangman, thief;
Let ’im go to Hell as lief

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/’ is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

PREMIER HOLMAN’S POLICY.
The N.S.W. State session staggered to its
finish last week, and immediately the new
electoral campaign opened. The llolman
Government gave three cheers for itself at a
public meeting in Sydney Town Hall, and
reluctantly admitted that it was an amaz-
ingly good Government, and that it couldn’t
disguise its own merits from itself. Also,
it fell on its own neck and wept about the
misrepresentation to which it had been sub-
jected. Still, even if it had wept twice
as much as it did, and had fallen so heavily
on its own neck as to break that organ in
three places, its tale would have been un-
convincing. It was too evidently a struggle
to.put the best face on a very poor set of
circumstances, and sometimes even the best
face looked horrible, and almost suggested the
Countenance at the Window. For instance, it
was stated flatly: “We promised decentrali-
sation and we have done that," A lot of
effrontery is required to make a statement
of the sort, when every one of the State’s
closed-up deep-water ports remains as blank
as it was before, and nothing is done any-
where. Nor is anything of a promising
nature proposed to be done, though there
are schemes for sundry improvements at
one or two hopeless bits of coast which are
practically open roadsteads —places which
have no merits save their lack of merit, and
the fact that their utter badness is calcu-
lated to make any competition with Sydney
impossible. Then this other assurance was
given in affable fashion: “We promised to
put the State burden of taxation on the
shoulders best able to bear it,” and if
young Posterity’s shoulders are the ones
best able to carry the vast new interest bill,
that guarantee has certainly been redeemed.
Further, among the carefully-fulfilled prom-
ises were mentioned the building of model
suburbs for the working classes, and the
furnishment of a just scheme of industrial
arbitration. If Daceyville, which is being
run at a loss for advertising purposes, is a
series of suburbs instead of the solitary
specimen it appears to be, then the first
pledge has held good. And if an arbitration
system under which strikes have been so
lamentably numerous is just, then the second
one is also in first-class order. But that
seems to imply that the strikers who refuse
to abide by the just system’s decisions are
very unjust, and an inference of that sort is
a cold sort of thing for any Government to
throw at its supporters.
For the truly magnificent shortage the
Premier, who seems to be a gushing child of
Nature and a Harold Skimpole of public
life, had two main explanations to offer.
One was that, for every extra shilling the
Government had obtained from the public
works of the State, thirteenpence had gone
out in expenses. Apparently, judging by
results, this arrangement includes even the
money obtained by the recent large increase
in railway fares (except as regards work-
men’s tickets), and if it costs Is. Id. to
charge a man Is. extra for the same old
ticket, he must surely have been told of the
increase at great length and with much
costly eloquence. Demosthenes would have
sold the new tickets at less expense, and
Mark Antony would have done a '“bob’s”
worth of oration over the dead body of
Caesar’s free pass on more moderate terms.
But the public knew already about this mat-
ter of buying 20s. for £1 Is. Bd. The fact was
made clear enough by the Auditor-General
and other authorities. What it didn’t (and
doesn’t) know was: (1) Why the Holman-
McGowen Government was so imbecile as
to do such a thing; (2) whether it intends
to keep on doing it; (3) how long, with pub-
lic works increasing, and the income from
them increasing, the process of buying Is.
for Is. Id. can be continued without break-
age. On none of these points was any
satisfaction forthcoming. The Premier ap-
parently reckoned he had cleared away any
charge of financial incapacity when he
stated the exact amount of the incapacity.
A further exposition of the case was that
the Government had been too optimistic.
That was also suspected before. If it
wasn’t too optimistic, then the only possible
explanation would have been that it was a
composite fool, or perhaps an utter and irre-
deemable corporate scoundrel, which tried
to run the State on the rocks as a matter
of set purpose and premeditated sin. But
a Government which, despite good seasons
and increased taxation and a steadily-rising
revenue, manages to outrun the constable
every year is entirely too optimistic. And
a Government which, after these admissions,
declares that its policy is sound and brilliant,
and must needs lead to great material pros-
perity, is too impudent. And a Government
which tries to whoop things up in its last
moments, with proposals for dozens of new
railways, all to be run presumably on the
thirteenpence for a shilling racket —though
a lot of the proposals look much more like
giving thirteenpence for sixpence, or even
for threepence—is too awful for words.
Incidentally, it may be mentioned that
Premier Holman’s explanation of how his
crowd fell, through simple baby faith in the
future, and by reason of a too lavish fram-
ing of the Estimates, doesn’t altogether hold
water. The Estimates were shamefully ex-
ceeded, despite the warnings given very
publicly by Treasurer Cann that the finan-
cial ship was going into shallow water.
Apparently it was a Ministry in which each
man did as he pleased—a Ministry headed
by a dull person who was too tired to care,
and a flashy voluble politician who was too
casual to know. The fact that the really
huge deficit came in the final session made
the proceedings look unpleasantly like the
wholesale use of public money for private
ends —the public money going in works to
placate the electors, and the private ends
being the re-election to place and salary of
the men who handed it out. However, this
article has already given the Government the
benefit of the doubt, and set the trouble down
to optimism.
* * * *
Then Premier Holman shook the empty
cash-box in the teeth of the future, and
looked the whole world in the face, and
optimised. The loan boom is to continue,
for Bull-Cohen will never get tired of
lending us money; and the good seasons are
to continue; and therefore the revenue is to
expand naturally. (It has done that for
years past, but the present Government kept
its expenditure so far ahead of the expan-
sion that the calamity came all the same.)
Another heap of new taxes are to be put on,
and they will also help to straighten things,
though the previous heaps of new taxes only
seemed to leave things worse than before.
One way and another, enough new revenue
is to be raised, with luck and optimism, by
next June to pay off the deficit as it existed
at last June. As for the new deficit which
is piling up—-during the first three months
of this financial year the outgoings exceeded
the income by some £BOO.OO0 —the Lord
looks after his own, and the Devil takes the
hindmost. Sometimes things come right, and
sometimes they don’t, and why should a
thoroughly cheerful Premier worry about de-
tails? Holman admitted that his people had
deliberately broken their promise to estab-
lish a genuine sinking fund —a matter which
would have cost some money—but he put
this political swindle so nicely that it seemed
almost a merit. He didn’t mention, though
he might have done so, that they had actu-
ally reduced the paltry payments which
Wade used to make to the Debt Redemption
Fund. He offered no opinion as to whether
it is, or is not, an utterly blatant and vil-
lainous thing for a Government of so much
well-advertised honesty to attain office on a
promise of economy, reduced borrowing, and
loan expenditure only on works that will pay
full interest and sinking fund —and then
perform as this Ministry has done. Some
people might regard the situation as one of
fraudulent political bankruptcy, but the
Premier didn’t seem to think it even called
for explanation. Possibly he would opine,
in a purely political sense, that the presence
of seven decomposing bodies in his dining-
room required no explanation. There are
individuals who take things as they come in
a marvellous fashion. But he spread him-
self at great length on the costly, and often
most commendable, social and industrial
measures which his Government had passed
without providing enough money to pay for
them, whereby the glory was liable to arrive
before the election, while the sordid bill or
account or invoice wouldn’t turn up till after
the election. And he enumerated costly and
often commendable measures which are to
be attempted in the future if the Holman-
McGowen Ministry comes back to the loaves
and sundries of office, without saying whom
he was going to tax to pay for them. The
methods of Holman are not at all new. The
financier who really formulated them was a
certain Calonne in France just before the
great Revolution. They had been practised
in an amateur, scrappy sort of way before
his time, but he put them into shape. His
idea was that the sure road to prosperity
was to keep the money moving round, no
matter how you got the money. And his
scheme did three laps on a sort of circular
track ; in other words, he lasted about three
years. First the money came round. Then
the bill came round. Finally the spectre of
insolvency came round. Then Calonne fled
for fear of what might come round next.
■* * * *
There were perorations, and patches of
purple glory, and strange omissions in the
policy speech. The orator’s party came into
power pledged to the abolition of the super-
fluous State Governor, and instead it almost
grovelled to him, and opened hostilities
against the Australian Governor-General. It
was pledged to the abolition of the super-
fluous Legislative Council of life nominees,
and at any time in its long tenure of office
it might have insisted on swamping that
body with enough new members to carry the
Abolition Bill, and tendered its resignation
if its proposal came up against the dead
wall of his Ex.’s veto. It neither attempted
to abolish the Upper House nor to secure a
commanding majority therein, so the Upper
House rejected or dropped a whole lot of
badly-devised measures, and, in its own won-
derfully unwise fashion, saved the Govern-
ment much anguish by relieving it of many
million pounds’ worth of Public Works
schemes which it almost had to put on its
bill of fare, yet which it couldn’t have paid
for even to save its soul. Holman spoke
bitterly about the lack of a Labor majority
in the Nominee Chamber, but preserved a
great heap of silence as to the reason why
his Ministry hadn’t tried to secure a majority
there. He preserved much reticence about
the strange device by which a Labor mem-
ber, who had risen in insurrection and was
very much in the way, was sent to the
United States, with £4 a day for expenses
in addition to the Parliamentary salary
which he wasn’t earning, to report on some-
thing so intangible that the State hasn’t
quite got the hang of it to this day. He
wasn’t voluble about the obvious breach of
the agreement by which Henry Willis was
induced to take the Speaker’s chair and save
the Ministry from destruction. He didn’t
rend the welkin with explanation re that
amazing Income Tax Bill, by which it was
seriously attempted to give the absentee
landlord a material advantage over any
little Australian manufacturing company
which employed Australian white labor at
Australian white man’s wages. He didn’t
clamor in two columns of small print as to
why, under his Fair Rents Bill, a kindly
sort of landlord who let a decent house for
275. 6d. a week was to be hauled before the
court and compelled to reduce his charges,
while a hungry ruffian who charged 31s.
for a worse house was to be exempt. In
short, Premier Holman’s policy speech was
a very good effort to listen to, a pleasant-
sounding affair, a running river of musical
eloquence, a tinkling cymbal, and a sound
like a vagrant summer wind among the
trees. But it told no intelligent inquirer
anything that he really required to know.
THE HOPELESS CONGESTION
POLICY.
The following items of news appeared in
one issue of Sydney Telegraph last week,
and they are quoted as the text. After them
comes the sermon :
“ALMOST HOPELESS.”
CONGESTION AT NEWCASTLE.
STEAMERS CANNOT GET BERTHS.
Newcastle, Thursday.—The shipping congestion is
growing more acute, and has become very serious
indeed. Mr. C. Barratt, of the Wallsend Coal Co.,
says the colliery has been idle two days, and the
Tunnel one, as vessels wanting coal cannot get berths.
The steamer Prometheus arrived on Monday, and
did not get a berth until late on Wednesday night.
The company has another steamer booked for Mon-
day, and if a berth cannot be obtained for her she
will have to be diverted to Sydney.
Mr. M. C. Reid (Melbourne S.S. Co.) says the
Sydney, a passenger steamer, arrived at midnight on
Monday, and only got a berth after 60 hours’ delay,
occasioning a loss of £2OO.
Mr. C. B. Greaves (Huddart, Parker and Co.)
said the Wimmera arrived on Tuesday, and was
delayed over 48 hours. The Werribee reached port
on Wednesday morning, and will not get a berth until
6 a.m. on Friday.
Mr. J. Reid (Paterson and Co.) had the Alabama
delayed 30 hours. The Wear is in port, and has no
prospect of a berth.
These, the shipping companies say, are only a
few instances, showing how acute the congestion is.
Several oversea vessels are also being delayed. The
position is almost hopeless.
Sydney got its start in the early days, not
because it was one of the finest harbors on
the east coast of Australia, but because
there was enough drinkable water for a
few people in the Tank Stream,. a rivulet
which is now covered over, and which serves
no purpose save to soak miserably into the
cellars of Pitt-street warehouses. New-
castle, vaguely known in > the beginning as
Coaly Town, got its start for various rea-
sons. The first finds of coal happened to
be made there close alongside the shore, in-
stead of at Maitland or some other place in
the vicinity. Nobody seriously imagined
that Newcastle coal would go further afield
than Sydney, or that it would be carried to
its destination in anything more formidable
than sailing vessels of 200 or 300 tons. And
as it was reckoned that the coal would only
bi wanted to cook the domestic chop 0 f
Sydney, people inferred that an occasional
delay of a week or two or three, by reason
of tides, winds, bars, shifting banks and the
like, wouldn’t really matter. If coal did
run short in Sydney the inhabitants could
always eke out their fuel supply by cutting
down a few trees where the great Mark
Foy or Anthony Hordern or Beard
W atson warehouses now stand. Newcastle
like Rockhampton and Townsville, was good
enough for the day and the evil thereof. So
it was established, and it grew. Now, when
it is out of date as a port for big ships, it
has enough votes to prevent the sort ’ of
place that would really be an up-to-date port
having a show. It has votes because it has
population, while the vastly superior Port
Stephens, because it has no population, has
no votes. And Newcastle got the population
and the voting power because, when it was
Coaly Town a century ago, the great coal
supply was there, and the river was quite
good enough for the little sailing craft of
the period. No one expected larger craft or
a wider field of commerce. As for the idea
that there would be need for an outlet for
all the export trade of Northern N.S.W.,
nobody dreamt of anything of the sort. There
was nothing—and there was never going to
be anything—in the north save heathen nig-
gers and kangaroos.
* * * *
A great part of the coal-delving business
has moved out to Maitland. Port Stephens
is as handy to Maitland as Newcastle is, and
it isn’t a shifting, bar-bound and perpetually
silting river mouth, but an inlet with per-
manent deep water. If it were utilised it
would relieve the congestion of the coal-
export business at Newcastle, and even the
Sydney Telegraph, a strongly pro-conges-
tion paper, hinted last week that the
trouble there had become almost intolerable.
When steamers are losing more than £3 an
hour simply because an inefficient or over-
crowded port can’t give them a berth at
which to load, the situation may with good
reason be described as intolerable. Further-
more, the opening up of the natural deep-
water harbor of Port Stephens, by means of
a few miles of railway and a few wharves,
would furnish an outlet for big ships to take
away the wheat and wool and meat and
hides of Northern N.S.W., and thus ease the
pressure on Sydney. The fact that Sydney
can’t tackle its vast responsibilities in this
line has been set forth often enough in the
pro-congestion Sydney dailies, and New-
castle, being unable to adequately deal with
its own and Maitland’s coal trade, can offer
little assistance. The constant complaints
that Sydney and Newcastle are quite un-
equal to the strain put upon them are
humorous, considering that the papers which
complain most loudly on this subject are
also those which object most furiously to
the opening of other ports. Certainly Syd-
ney could stand much more strain than it
does if, by a series of city rail-
ways, and bridges and tunnels, the
north side of the harbor was made avail-
able for commerce. But, either through the
influence of the great Private Enterprise
ferry monopoly, or for some other reason,
the north side never is made available.
The unreal programme of the Holman-
McGowen Government included certain pro-
posals which were described as “decentrali-
sation.” There was a scheme for connect-
ing certain parts of the Iliverina with Mel-
bourne, and the Upper House, which the
llolman-McGowen Government had care-
fully refrained from swamping with men of
its own way of alleged thinking, threw this
out. There were observations about arti-
ficial ports at Coff’s Harbor and Port
Kembla, which are two open roadsteads, and
are no more like real ports than is the
middle of the Pacific. But as to any pro-
posal that a show should be given to such
genuine harbors as Port Stephens and Two-
fold Bay, no mention was made. The whole
decentralisation business was a fraud.
Curiously enough, the Holman-McGowen
Government is propounding big schemes for
the construction of another Daceyville—a
State colony of cheap houses for working
men—at Newcastle, so that there may be
more accommodation for miners where the
mining industry is dying out, and for wharf
laborers where the trouble isn’t lack of
wharf-laborers but lack of space for ships.
As regards the building of new Daceyvilles
at Port Stephens and Twofold Bay not a
word is said. The old coastal cities that
are have the voting power, and the new
cities, that might be but are not, have no
voting power worth mentioning. If the
suffrage, in coastal regions, went, not by
people but by feet of water, Port Stephens
would return three members to Newcastle’s
one.
The old Federal capital question arose
last week in the House of Representatives?
and Prime Minister Cook spoke up for Can-
berra. He said—and quite truly—that if
that city, built on Government-owned land,
is properly administered, it will cost nothing.
In other words, the ground rents which the
Government collects from the city will pay
the whole cost of the construction and main-
tenance of the city. That much can be said
of an inland town, without coal, without
water power, without manufacturing and
commercial prospects, and with an expensive
difficulty about its water supply because
much of the supply lies below the city level.
A great deal more could be said about
publicly-owned cities at Dalgety, with enough
water power to run the industries of the
biggest capital on earth ; at Port Stephens,
with one of the finest harbors in Australia
and one-third of the State to feed that har-
bor ; and at Twofold Bay, with almost equal
advantages. But the vested interests of
Sydney and Newcastle stand in the way.
Even when Newcastle admits that its posi-
tion is “almost hopeless” it is just as deter-
mined as ever it was that no hopeful ad-
jacent port shall come to the State’s assist-
ance.

last session, it smote, among other things
the proposal to grant the Australian Gov-
ernment HOOO acres of land at Jervis Bav
then the remnants of old Parochialism broke
loose, and raged as if Sheol had taken fire
and all the inmates were rushing to the dooi
and treading on each other’s tails. A par
Pally forgotten person named Henry C.
Hangar leaped on his hat in Sydney Tele-
graph last Monday to this effect (at least
this was the end of the effect) :
. Z he „ n C K co " ne ] cted with this Federal Grab, as it
may well be called, appear to be the following
(1) By the Constitution the Federal authorities
are entitled to 100 square miles round the Federal
capital—-they have managed to secure 900.
(2) They have obtained virtual control of a rail-
way to Jervis Bay, which they propose to make a
Federal port.
(3) They have secured very nearly 9000 acres at
Jervis Bay on the south and best side of the bay for
commercial purposes.
(4) They want 9000 acres more.
(51 They desire to get control of the whole of the
waters of the bay.
(6) They want sovereign rights over land and
water.
The whole grab has professedly been for defensive
purposes, and the Naval College, which might well
have been situated inland, is in forward progress on
the south side of the bay. But what, it may be asked,
does a Naval College, or even protecting batteries
want with 18,000 acres of land?
This State seems to have but few friends in the
Federal Parliament—it is time we looked after our-
selves.
It is strange that the old yarn mentioned in
the first paragraph should hang out so long
and so persistently, and that gentlemen of
a sort should circulate it so unscrupulously.
By the Constitution the Federal authorities
weren’t exactly “entitled to 100 square miles
round the Federal capital”; they were en-
titled to any—area that was not less than
100 square miles, but so long as the area
wasn’t so large as to mop up more than
the whole extent of New South Wales they
might legally have any amount more, pro-
vided they could get it. Regarding this
matter, the attitude of the Old Parochialists
was: (1) That the capital must be in New
South Wales, and that no other State
should be allowed to give an acre of land to
assist in making it a decent sort of capital.
George Reid laid this down —after the fam-
ous and disgraceful repudiation of his
pledge that a majority and a 50,000 aflirma-
tive vote would suffice to carry the Federal
Constitution in New South Wales—as the
only condition on which his State would
federate. (2) It was resolved in the
Parochial press that the Ma State was
grievously wronged, injured and robbed in
having to surrender the territory which it
had insisted on surrendering. (3) It was
claimed by the Old Parochialists that New
South Wales had a right to make the capi-
tal. of a whole continent —the only city
which is, or has ever been, the capital of a
whole continent —a mere dirty, typhoid-
haunted village, dependent for its' water
catchment area, its reservoirs, its drainage
outlet, its city space, its suburban space, its
parks, its public offices, its Governor-
General’s residence, and all the rest of its
civilisation on a scrap of land which
measured ten miles by ten. Even a small
country town couldn’t, in many cases, lead
the sanitary existence, if it were prohibited
from going further than five miles afield
for its water-supply, being planted in the
middle of a 100-square-mile block, with
maddened parochialists watching at each
border to see that it didn’t steal any State
property, such as a pint of clean water.
Probably the finest thing in Henry
Hangar’s diatribe is the proposal that the
Australian naval force should be trained in
an inland college—trained on dry land.
Some day it may rest with that naval force
to shed its blood in order to prevent Henry
Hangar and his relatives being confiscated,
pauperised, and perhaps disembowelled.
Nobody ever devised a way of efficiently
training a young naval force on dry land.
But the selfishness of the first gang of
Parochialists fixed the Australian capital in
N.S.W.; then planted it on a humble scrap
of ground far inland, so that it might not
grow into a citv which was liable to com-
pete in a manufacturing and commercial
sense with Sydney; and then objected to
allowing it an adequate sea-outlet so that
it could get a chance to train its naval
cadets, lest the sea outlet might grow into a
port which would compete against Sydney.
It is all a miserable, dirty, mean, disrepu-
table business, and it shows the evil results
of trusting the business of a whole con-
tinent to men with the souls of Little
Pedlington.

in the Peake-Butler gerrymander; but

snowstorm on account of a downpour of
“gerrymander” cards. They put it briefly
that Governor Elbridge Gerry, of Massa-
chusetts, was guilty of a wickedness by
which 50.163 Gerry supporters had 29 mem-
bers, while 55,766 anti-Gerries had only 11;
but under the much less nefarious Peake
scheme 122,780 metropolitan, Wallaroo and
Pirie electors have 19 members, while 102,701
country electors have 27. To monkey with
the Treasury, so that doubtful electorates
may be bribed, is bad enough : but to monkey
with the electorates is like poisoning the
reservoir, or robbing the blind man of his
dog. Of course the reservoir always is
poisoned, more or less, and the blind man is
seldom able to find his whole dog. Thus for
the Australian House of Representatives in
1910 there were 21.120 voters (minimum for
N.S.W.) at the Barrier, which returned J.
Thomas, and 37,498 (maximum for
N.S.W.) at Parkes. wdiich returned
Bruce Smith. In Victoria there were
two Federal electorates which had one
member for over 41,000 electors, and
this meant that they were robbed of half
their fair measure of representation as com-
pared with Broken Hill, and there were
four Victorian electorates which contained
far more voters than the most populous elec-
torate in N.S.W. The voters in Westralia
ranged from 21.647 (Frazer) to 39.377
(Bigjoiln Forrest). And the State elec-
torates are absolutely wonderful. In N.S.W.
they ranged on last election day from 5052
voters (Meehan) and 5540 (Millard), to
14.975 (Varney Parkes). 16.347
(Arthur) and 16.828 (W. Kearsley).
And S.A. in its Lower House has jerried a
good deal. In 1912 Alexandra returned four
members for 11,487 electors, and Port Ade-
laide three for 29,435. These are wild dis-
crepancies. A lot more could be dug out in
other States, but the list would tend to be-
come monotonous. Still, some mention should
be made of the Victorian State Lower House,
where, in 1911, Holden stood for 5793
voters at Warrenheip and Swinburne for
-.0.b1U at Hawthorn. But in all these cases
the discrepancies are all more or less hap-
hazard, whereas In S. Australia things have
been so arranged that the discrepancies shall
Put Labor in the soup and give Peake a
comfortable seat at the banquet.
“The Bulletin noius out its Hand to an
Old Acquaintance.
George Reid has come back to Australia
amid great applause from the Tory morning
papers. He has even been hailed in large
black type as “A Great Australian,” and
vast reports as to how he has dined and
lunched and corresponded and slept on be-
half of this country have filled the daily
organs. Never once, when there was a
chance to consume a snack in the interests
of the Confmonwealth, does it seem that
George Rei?d went away empty. When a
storm of food was blowing he was on deck,
and ready to lower the boat into a howling
sea of refreshment and face the worst.
When the plum pudding was shot furiously
at the wicket lie was batting, and putting
up a great score. Horatius, holding the
bridge against the enemy’s commissariat de-
partment, was fio greater than he. Yet,
apart from all that conversation and victual,
what does Australia remember of GfeORGE
Reid? Looking back into the recesses of
the past it recalls a jester of great circum-
ference, whose jests were none of the finest.
He probably made his best effort when he
hinted that picturesque old Edward Brad-
don was a lunatic. There/ is some reminis-
cence of a Freetrader who hadn’t the
courage to practise Freetrade, though he
described the revenue he derived from his
Protectionist duties as an evidence of the
splendid results attained under a Freetrade
system. Then people recollect the financier
who invented the great Cash Basis, and so
made his one amazing surplus. It was a
really groat idea. A vast sum of money
had to be handed over to the Bank of Eng-
land about June 15, to pay a half-j’ear’s
interest on a portion of the Public Debt
on July 1, and all previous Treasurers had
charged this liability to the old year which
ended on June 30. By the great inspiration
of charging it to the new year, which com-
menced on July 1, and reckoning the cash
which had been actually paid away about
June 15 as money on hand at June
30, a paper surplus was created, but
even the paper surplus faded away in time,
and became a rotten deficit. Memories still
hang around of civil service “retrenchments”
in the interests of economy, and the pay-
ment of compensation to the retrenched out
of the Superannuation Fund which was
built up by the contributions of the civil
service as a provision for its old age. A
few individuals see with the mind’s eye a
weighty humorist who bitterly denounced
Federation, and asked with scorn whether
one sober State should coalesce with five
drunkards? Yet this man turned ardent
Federationist when it was time to “dish”
Pabkes, who had repented of his retire-
ment, and was trying to struggle back
to office on the Federal ticket. Tnen, when
Pabkes was out of the way, this same
corpulent political wanderer failed, as usual,
to keep square. He never could keep square
in politics, and he never could understand
the existence of anything like political
honesty. He pledged himself to the other
States, that the Federal Constitution would
accepted in N.S.W. provided there were
•>O,OOO affirmative votes, and an affirmative
majority. When his awful follower Neild
proposed that the N.S.W. Parliament should
become a liar and a scoundrel and a black-
guard and a disgrace, by breaking the agree-
that it should raise the minimum
affirmative vote to an almost impossible
figure, and thus disqualify the majority
which voted “Yes”— Reid was partly for
the lie and partly against the fraud. In
the end, he helped to carry the swindle,
then he blackmailed the other States into
guaranteeing N.S.W. the possession of the
Australian capital, as the price at which
he would resume support of the movement
which he professed to have started. He
was something in the position of the host
who holds up his guests with a gun and
demands their valuables. He slunk away
from the Federal Convention—the one which
originally drafted the Federal Constitution
—without any plain expression of discontent
with the scheme which had been devised,
lhen he got some strenuous Federationists
to appear with him on a platform at a great
Federation meeting in Sydney, and it was
only when he turned dog on the proposed
Constitution, and denounced it almost from
one end to the other, that they realised what
kind of an unpleasant sample of mirth had
been played on them. Reid was incidentally
the man who tried to charge the crockery
supply of the Jenolan accommodation house
to loan funds, as a permanent and reproduc-
tive work. His Ministry was celebrated for
poverty and misery, for sand-shifting jobs
and rail-painting jobs, for doss-houses and
soup-kitchens, and for other relief schemes.
It was a time of woe, when the export of
N.S.W. population was chronically in excess
of the import. Australians who are old
enough to remember Reid in the days of his
local greatness, are apt simply to recall a
shifty, dodgy man who apparently regarded
political decency as a subject of amusement,
and who would rather go sideways than
straight, because the sidelong track appealed
to his perverted sense of fun. His one
strong point was apparently his readiness to
sacrifice Australian industry to the interests
of any foreign importer who happened this
way, yet when he bumped up against the
sugar business, even his strong point failed
him. Now the “Great Australian,” who was
born in the dreary locality of Renfrew
(Scotland), has come back to the country
which has supplied him with such remark-
ably good board and lodging for a number
of years, and the country is expected to be
glad.
The City of the Mangled Carter.
A Sydney daily paper casually published the
following item last week :
Through the wheel of his dray sinking into a rut
at the corner of Missenden-road and Richard-slreet,
Newtown, on Saturday morning, George Ives (59), a
carter, was thrown into the roadway and seriously
injured. One of the wheels apparently passed over
the man’s thighs. The Newtown District Ambulance
rendered first aid, and conveyed the man to the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital. He was admitted suffering
from a fractured skull and severe lacerations and
bruises about the body.
Newtown is not a backblocks hamlet with
one policeman and no drains. On the con-
trary, it is one of Sydney’s most prosperous
suburbs. It possesses an ornate Town Hall,
a heavily rabbit-skinned Mayor, the usual
gang of aldermen, and a thousand other
luxuries. Yet it looks on unprotestingly
while drays fall into the crevasses of what
it calls its roads, and it remains calm while
the victims of such mishaps are hurried off
to the nearest hospital. What a priceless
example of the blessings of habitude! The
residents of the different Sydney suburbs
have become so used to roads which resemble
ploughed fields sown with stones, that inci-
dents which would horrify and scandalise
French, German, Belgian, English and other
more or less civilised folks leave them quite
unmoved. Newtown, where carter Ives met
his overthrow, is, as a matter of fact, rather
less dreadful, at least as regards its main
streets, than the generality of municipalities
around Sydney. The roads of Mascot, for
example, are almost as sensational as its
smells. Most of Woollahra is appalling—
Ocean-street itself, the main artery of that
affluent suburb, being chronically in such a
state of upheaval and disorder as would
shame those responsible for the administra-
tion of an outback village, assuming any-
thing of the sort was allowed to eventuate
there. It has been estimated variously that
it will require from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000
to put the roads of New South Wales, as a
whole, on a footing with those of, say, Ire-
land ; and all the authorities are in hearty
unanimity on the point that no conceivable
Government, Liberal or Labor, will find the
cash. Out of the quarter of a million which
was allocated the other day. with the for-
lorn aim of repairing the State’s ruinous
causeways, the Sydney municipal authori-
ties are to get £lO,OOO. Such a sum will be
pathetically useless. The whole of it could
be sunk in the doctoring of portion of the
main Parramatta-road. Apparently nothing
of any efficacy will be done until a Greater
Sydney is instituted. The same weird vari-
ety of local jealousy which is responsible for
the periodical rows that occur between cer-
tain individual States, and the seething
hatred and ill-feeling that produce the dis-
turbances which arise constantly between
the States and the Commonwealth, impel
Sydney’s multitudinous municipalities to
deal it oftt to each other on every occasion
possible. A popular method is for the
patriot suburb to keep any road which con-
nects with the adjacent, and hence inimical
suburb, in the worst possible state of dis-
repair, so that the residents of the hostile
region may be exasperated and its drays
overturned and its carters dashed to the
earth and mangled. This is gratifying, of
course, in its way, to the municipal fathers;
just as a push derives joy from the spectacle
of a rival gang fleeing adown the wind before
a . rain ,of blue metal. But from the larger
viewpoint—from the viewpoint, that is to
say, of the community in the mass —it is so
much damphoolishness. Apart from the
universal danger to life and limb there is the
question of expense. More millions must
be lost to Sydney and environs every year,
by reason of its criminally neglected thor-
oughfares, if only in the way of damages to
motor-cars, lorries, drays, vans, buggies,
tip-carts, sulkies and other vehicles, than
would suffice to keep every main road, street,
lane, cul-de-sac and alley-way in the entire
metropolis looking like the surface of a bil-
liard-table. Sordid parish jealousy of as-
sorted kinds has been to blame largely for
Australia’s starved ports; for the fixing of
the Federal capital in a hopelessly unsuit-
able region; for the transcontinental rail-
way bungle, and for similar tragedies of
national moment. The whole business sug-
gests to thinking people something demented
in the way of false economy-—for example,
the spectacle of a millionaire who insists on
living in a cave.
“The Blackpool Case,” which for the most
part has been a futile and costly law suit
by F. S._ Meyers, of Melbourne, against the
autocratic local horse-racing authorities,
has raised the question whether the rulers
of any sporting club should be given freedom
from responsibility for libel. Meyers’s
grievance boils down to this: The stewards
of one racing club, whose judgment was
confirmed by the almighty V.R.C., found
him guilty of straight-out roguery, calling
it “suspicious practices.” Meyers, view-
ing his practices in this case as a level-
headed business man, admits their suspici-
ousness, but maintains that the first sus-
picion was founded on a misunderstanding
of the facts, and that the subsequent rejec-
tion of his explanation by the racing court
of appeal was unreasonable. The V.R.C.
ruled that his “suspicious practices” (which
he admits) were proof of the roguery
(which he denies), and he is left without
any means of bringing his grievance before a
jury. Convicted of “suspicious practices,”
whereof the most innocent citizen is often
guilty, he was sentenced to a year’s “dis-
qualification” as a racehorse owner, and
would have been expelled from the V.R.C.
had he not got a restraining order from the
High Court. Being grossly libelled, as he
alleges, by the committee which disqualified
him, he cannot get any redress beyond that
negative sort which the High Court has
given him. The Club has autocratic powers
as far as racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys
and gee-gees are concerned. It can brand
men as rogues—and it ought to brand them
more freely than it does—but it cannot be
convicted of the occasional mistake which it
is humanly capable of committing. F. S
Meyers seemingly is the victim of this
wrong state of things.
* .
There would appear to be a sort of
Camorra or black hand fooling round Mel-
bourne. Consider a little of the evidence.
The other day a young married man was
called to his front door during a house-
warming and shot. Before dying he hinted
that he had a good idea who his murderer
was, but. neither he nor his co-revellers,
would give the suspect a name. A
while later a man, drinking with some mates
in nitzroy, was mauled so ruthlessly that
he presently passed over. He spoke not one
word as to the identity of the mauler. Neither
did his friends. As a result there is a
very dangerous criminal at large, and likely
to stay so. Last May two men were shot
by the same gun, in a Little Lonsdale slum,
the police skirmished up actual witnesses
of the shootings, but not one of them would
identify the shooter. A young man rushed
into the Melbourne Hospital recently and
asked to be treated for a knife-wound in thd
back. He said that “someone” had punc-
tured him while he was shaving himself.
Again there was the same weird reluctance
to go into details. And, at the time of
writing, there is in the same hospital one
who threatens to leave it only for the
cemetery. He was brought there by a
woman, who gave names and addresses for
both—all false. She said the man had been
shot while, watching a row in Swans! on-
street. The victim, on recovering conscious-
ness. averred that the episode had occurred
in King-street. The police have found that
Cold Shivers, an Echo and Some Whale-
like Truths.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■ *^ lp P ro fPerity that comes from extravagance
in the expenditure of borrowed money will be fol-
lowed by a dismal reaction, and in this all classes
alike would participate. . . .This Government three
•' f', ars a o° came into office upon a policy of impos-
sible economy, which practically prohibited the
laismg of any more loans for ordinary developmental
works Yet it has committed the country to loan
expenditure and revenue expenditure on a scale un-
precedented in the days of the country’s wildest ex-
travagance. Colossal truths that seem to have strayed
into Sydney Telegraph.
Do you ever get the cold shivers, carnerados;
the shuddery feeling that something is
going to happen?
lou are not sure whether it is premonition,
hallucination, jim-jam, liver or the
weather—all you know is that you have
got the cold shivers!
( an it be that they are about to scratch the
favorite—the favorite you are “on” to
some considerable extent?
Or has the Buccaneer Extended proved a
duffer?
Oan it be possible that your wife suspects?
purely to Heaven Jones won’t go insolvent?
And that pain —is it indigestion, incipient
rheumatism, or angina pectoris?
It is a sad and afflicting thing, the cold
shivers, carnerados !
detached, insignificant— you
feel that.
Picture to yourself, then, the polysynthetic
Cold Shivers of a Great Daily!
The Titanic shudder of the pantomorphic
Press, which suddenly realises that
Something is Going to Happen!
The perturbation of Great Editors; the
alarmed air of the financial, news, sport-
ing and social magnates ; the anguish of
haughty Managers, and the general,
though indefinable impression that the
Time is dashed near Ripe!
Ripe ior disaster, varneruuos —ripe for dras-
tic reconsideration of OUR attitude and
policy, and for the proclamation of
Obvious Facts !
For, behold, “ the prosperity that comes from
extravagance in the expenditure of
BORROWED MONEY WILL BE FOL-
LOWED BY A DISMAL REACTION !”
Who said that?
Carnerados, I may not tell a lie —they said
it in the Sydney Telegraph—
Lord preserve us! —the Sydney Tele-
graph ! !
How are the mighty borrowers fallen and
the loan-mongers doing a perish !
How hath the Ethiopian changed his skin,
and the leopard his spots!
There goeth forth a well-known Voice—yea,
an echo of familiar sound is noised
abroad in King-street;
King-street ! ! !
Not 214 George-street, Sydney, N.S.W.!
They are playing a Bulletin record on the
Telegraph gramophone!
It soundeth like the noise of many loans
falling due together, and as of Cohen
lifting up his voice in mourning for his
shekels and refusing to be comforted !
The people that sat in financial darkness and
in the Shadow of Debt have seen a great
light, carnerados!
It is. the Light of Honest Finance illuminat-
ing the darkest places in the lOUnited
States of Australia !
Truth, like a naked whale, riseth in the ink-
well of the Great Borrowing Press !
The Great Editor and all his myrmidons are
a little bewildered, and murmur of dis-
mal reactions and a policy of impossible
economy in the same breath. It is a
hard saying.
For, of a verity, they must choose one or the
other. By the look of things they will
shortly experience both!
The days of Incredible Borrowings are over
and gone, Carnerados!
The day of Dismal Reactidn and Impossible
Economy approaches. Let us not blink
the Fact!
When the Sydney Telegraph gets the Cold
Shivers and preaches Honest Finance —
When it is seen that proposed loans at £5
per cent, to build tramways and rail-
ways returning £2 and £3 per cent, are
looked coldly upon—-
The Time is dasbpd near ripe !

there was no brawl in either locality about
that time, and also that the pair had reached
the hospital, per cab, fro»i a different direc-
tion altogether. Why all this mystery? If
there is one thing more than another that
one would expect a person to be chatty
about, it surely is the name, address and
general appearance of the person who had
attempted to assassinate him. It is notori-
ously hard to track down a Chow murderer.
The inhabitants of the different China-towns
of Australia stand by one another, where
crime is concerned, with dastardly fidelity.
The Asiatic informer knows what is com-
ing to him on the earliest available op-
portunity. But if this sort of convention
is to be got going among the meaner Mel-
bourne whites, then is the city faced with
a very serious problem indeed. It would be
bad if the place were intelligently policed.
As things are, it is a heap worse.
Charles Gregory Wade put up a fresh bluff
and a new pose last week. When the N.S.W.
Assembly increased its salary out of its ad-
miration of Fitzpatrick’s many disordered
qualities, it provided that if members did
not collect the increase the cash would lapse
along with the Parliament. So far Wade
has refrained from drawing the increase, and
it has been accumulating at the rate of £2OO
per annum. Now the time has arrived when
he can hang in the balance no longer. So
instead of letting the money go he proposes
to draw it and pay it into a trust account.
The trustees are to make inquiries of the
constituents and ascertain the feeling of
future meetings on the subject, and if they
decide that Wade should take the money he
will seize it with both hands, and thus put
an enemy in his tail pocket to steal away his
brains. If they decide he should not take
it he will pay it back to the Treasury. A
more original man would have collected the
money and invested it at compound interest
as the nucleus of a fund for the construc-
tion of the North Shore bridge, and then
passed the hat round for subscriptions after
the Dreadnought fashion. Wade has him-
self suggested that the bridge should be built
with private money, and this £2OO a year
looks like private money.
“Jeames” on Jews, and one Jew in parti-
cular
As was generally expected Prime Minister Asquith
proved stark enough, despite the howls of Lord Hugh
Cecil and the Conservative enemy generally, to do
the right thing and appoint Rufus Isaacs to the Lord
Chief Justiceship of England. Asquith is a staunch
friend, and as contemptuous of public opinion as it is
possible for one in his position to be —points wherein
he differs from the G.O.M., who ruthlessly turned
down Parnell the moment the scandal of his life was
disclosed to the world. This appointment will pro-
vide the followers of Bonar Law with some priceless
electioneering material. Apart from his association
with the Marconi scandals Isaacs has been a bank-
rupt. He failed badly in the Stock Exchange as a
young man. He is the first Jew and ’the first ex-
bankrupt to be Lord Chief Justice of England. The
Bar, Liberal and Conservative alike, will be delighted.
There has been no more popular man than Isaacs
practising in the London Courts within living mem-
ory—a result chiefly of his courtesy and kindliness
and generosity and other human qualities. Inciden-
tally he is a great lawyer—an admitted master at his
own game.
Jews always seem to me to divide up into two
classes, as regards appearance. The commercial Jew
is a coarse and sensuous-looking citizen mostly. His
nose and mouth are fat, his eyelids heavy and pendu-
lous, and his legs short and thick. In middfe life,
and often earlier, he runs to fat, partly owing to
heredity, partly to his love of rich food. Isaacs is
the other type—what one may pall the intellectual
variety of Hebrew. He has the spare figure of the
ascetic. All his features—his nose, his cheeks, his
lips—are lean. His vast and finely-modelled head
seems not to have a fragment of superfluous flesh on
it. Disraeli, Henry Irving and most of the other
great Jews were of this type.
Isaacs’ interests in life—apart from politics and
a profession which kept him going between 6 a.m.
and 4 p.m. on most week days—have been, hitherto,
music, cards and golf. The Sydney Telegraph re-
printed some nonsense from a New York paper to
the effect that Edward VII. always liked to play
bridge with Isaacs because the Jewish K.C. was one
of the few people he knew who played as badly as
himself. Edward VII. jvas, of course, a particularly
good bridge player, just as he was good at every
other card game. And if he hadn’t been, he was far
too keen a gambler to have deliberately sought out,
as a possible partner, one who would lose him his
money and teach him nothing. Isaacs, like most
Hebrews, is an excellent card-player. The chances
are, however, that he played little with Edward VII.,
anyhow. He never belonged to the Marlborough,
where the late King gambled most when he was in
London, and he had neither the time nor the inclina-
tion to mix with the royal set in the closing days of
the last feign, even supposing that the royal set had
wanted him.
Joynton Smith, who was in the
Labor Government’s last batch of
nominees t - the N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cil, has, it is reported, bought
Mark Foy’s Medlow Bath’s swell
caravanserai in the Blue Moun-
tains. The price is alleged to be
about half the £120,000 that Mark
Foy has, one way and another, put
into it. Joynton Smith, who got
his first experience of providing man
with food and drink on board ship,
is a hustling person of great con-
sequence in the liquor business
these days. Besides the Arcadia in
Sydney he now controls the three
biggest hotels in the Blue Moun-
tains —at Medlow, Katoomba and
Mount Victoria —and half the motor
tourist traffic in those picturesque
parts.

The Quinlan Opera Co. opened its most im-
portant production in Sydney, “The Ring,”
with the weird prologue, “The Rhinegold,”
in the customary fashion. Wagner called
this the Eve of the Trilogy. The first scene
looks like a slice out of the middle of the
night. Rhine maidens are swimming about
the bed of the river. There is just enough
light—like the glimmer of half a pound or
so of candles which the housekeeper-
mermaid had borrowed to see what
Alberich was doing—to give the audience an
idea of the slippery ways of Rhine maidens.
German critics divide the music of the
Rhinegold into 10 movements. These begin
with the aquatic sports already mentioned,
and include the Ring, the Giant, the YVal-
halla, the Youth movements, etc. You will
observe that there is no movement for the
audience. Bereaved of any interval, it can-
not even suck lemonade through a straw till
the finale. When Donner (Graham Marr)
shakes his hammer at the gathering storm
and Walhalla, like a pale pink ice-cream,
trembles through the mists, we know that
the audience movement is beginning. Donner,
the God of Thunder, is in the rainbow move-
ment at this crisis, and the train and ferry
goddesses are writhing into their theatre-
wraps. Alberich (Samuell) is a bad lot.
His principal business is to chase the Rhine-
gold (which looks like the gleam from a
chemist’s red lamp in the middle of the
river), for which he has abandoned his
pursuit of the mermaids. Wagner laid out
the musical scheme of this prologue as care-
fully as a gravedigger would arrange the
ground plan of a vault. The gods are bari-
tone (the useful Parker) Wotan; Donner, a
bass; Froh, who ought to be a tenor;
and Loge, tenor-in-chief. Hedmondt’s
voice gives the impression of having
a very fine past. As Loge, he sang
his most important remarks on the first
night with the husky sound of a frog in his
throat. As an actor Hedmondt is much
younger than his tenor. Wagner gives us
two leading Nibelungs. Alberich, who curses
in a baritone, and Mime, who shrieks his
woes in a higher key. Edna Thorn-
ton, as Fricka, henpecks Wotan in a round
contralto. Gladys Ancrum, as the Goddess
of Youth, quakes with fear in a wobbling
soprano. There are giants and other myths
in “The Rhinegold.” But the orchestra, under
Eckhold, is so important that it swamps the
performance. Wagner has given it every
color-tone from the swish of the Rhine to
the shimmer of the rainbow movement.
* * * *
In “The Valkyrie” Wagner enlarges on
the themes he loves best, and sets the mag-
nificent music of the score to thunder and
lightning. Sometimes it is merely summer
lightning, playing round the fiddles; more
often it sizzles like forked streaks of elec-

Brunnhildei Nordica, in spite of the pass-
ing of the years, puts far more battle into
that wild Norse yell for the enemy’s scalps
(on a tame municipal platform) than Per-
ceval Allen achieved with a foreground of
orchestra. The indispensable Eckhold was
in the chair, and whipped up his forces into
a stirring storm-burst to introduce the
arrival of Hunding in the hut. Karl von
Cochem (the Hunding) looked like a fierce
old billygoat in a fine pair of horns and a
raven beard, and kept both eyes on his
golden-haired wife, Sieglinde. This lady
needs a good deal of looking after. She
falls in love with the stranger, Siegmund
(Spencer Thomas), while he sleeps in his
boots on her hospitable hearth. That Sieg-
mund should turn out to be Mrs. Hunding’s
twin brother, and that she should love him
madly in the teeth of that staggering de-
velopment, is, of course, consistent with
Norse lore. Gladys Ancrum, a pretty and
youthful Sieglinde, will have to lose the
tremolo in her sweet soprano pipe before
she achieves Wagner. Robert Parker, as
Wotan, and Edna Thornton, the Fricka of
the Ring cycle, were the two most consist-
ent exponents of the sulphurous atmosphere
of “Valkyrie.” The second act was the
finest of the three struggles with the innum-
erable motifs. In the third act, “The Ride
of the Valkyrie” was tame. The militant
sisters attacked their chorus work with some
uncertainty, but the whiskers of conductor
Eckhold waved them on to a respectable
climax.

“Tannhauser,” which occurred in last
week’s deluge of first-nights, was chiefly re-
markable for the triumph of soprano Per-
ceval Allen over the fidgets that Wagner
flings into the difficult music of the Thurin-
gian lady’s score. Hedmondt was not the
Tannhauser of our dreams. Baritone Parker
sang Wolfram’s pet solo, “Star of Eve,” with
fine restraint and resisted the temptation to
fall over the refrain. Gladys Ancrum was
too leggy for Venus —but she is a sweet-
looking youngster, all the same. The vi-
brato in her voice, however, is becoming a
regular habit. Some strong-minded critic
will have to kiss the place to make it well.
Last week “Rigoletto,” “La Tosca” and
“Tales of Hoffmann” were circulated in
between the more classic courses of Wagner
and “Louise.” (“Classic” seems the safest
thing to say. After the prelude to “The
Ring” had been finished, this commentator,
in a candid mood,” would have written
“plum-puddingy.”) Of “Rigoletto” it has
been more or less said already that, failing
to give the orchestra much serious work to
do, there was nothing to remember in it
except D’Oisly’s spirited warble concern-
ing the high status of woman as a somer-
sault performer. The tragic “Tosca” gave
the chorus and the unimpeachable
orchestra larger chances; but it found
Samuell tired, and his Scarpia dull and
drowsy. Felice Lyne, because she can still
wear her waist in the right place, had been
a very charming heroine in “Rigoletto” ; but
in “Hoffmann” she seemed almost too girlish.
Her voice, however, was again listened to
with the utmost delight. As heard in Syd-
ney, it is birdlike. _ And, of course, because
there is a tune in it. the barcarolle was wel-
comed as an old friend who had brought a
box of sweets when he came last time.
Twice in the week wasn’t too much for
“Hoffmann.” and he will have another
chance to fill the house again early next
week.
“ THE RHINE-
GOLD,” AT
SYDNEY HER
MAJESTY'S.
God Wotan sees the worm that turned.
In Gustave Charpentier’s charming musi-
cal romance, “Louise,” Sydney found solace
after solid undercuts of Wagner. All the
vivacity and delicacy of the French school
of music bubbles over in “Louise.” It is the
champagne of grand opera, and there is no
headache next morning. Jeanne Brola, an
emotional actress first and a dramatic
soprano second, made the hit of her present
season here as the excitable love-and-duty-
tossed work-girl. Also, this fine perform-
ance by the Quinlan Co. (its best at date
of writing) included a night out for baritone
Samuell. As the kindly, toil-worn French
artisan, and the male parent of Louise, this
young Welsh singer has certainly created the
r6le in Sydney. The music suited his voice ;
he was in his best form; and his artistic
perception of the subtlety of Charpentier’s
themes made the first production of “Louise”
here a Samuell affair. Maurice D’Oisly—-
the artist lover Julian —was rather crowded
out of the picture by the bagginess of his
trousers and a woolly quality in his vocal
methods. There are reminiscences of Puc-
cini in Charpentier’s music, but the latter
is more swift in changing from grave to
say—so far as “Louise” is concerned. Edna
Thornton, always a safe artist, was a satis-
factory scold as the Mother, and boxed the
ears of Louise to hurried music. The chorus
singing in “Louise” gives us the Quinlan
amalgamated blend at its best. The or-
chestra achieved a gorgeous kaleidoscope of
tone color, under the baton of the watchful
Voghera.

Allen Doone continues to pile up a for-
tune in Australia, and the question: “What
Shall We Do With Our Irish?” appears to
be solved. Just at present they are nightly
packing the Palace (Sydney) to see A.
Doone play Thomas Barry, in the romantic
drama “Barry, of Ballymoore.” Like most
of the Doone productions, it is a slender
thing, held up by the actor-manager’s per-
sonal popularity with his characteristic
audiences, the admirable way in which it is
staged and the songandance, “Eyes of Irish
Blue,” by a band of clever youngsters. If
the fresh, rippling voices of them could be
substituted for the persistent, strained and
often maudlin vocalism of Doone—say,
wouldn’t that be a dream? The story of
the piece centres round the love for and
conquest of Lady Mary Bannon (Edna
Keeley), an Ulster heiress, who mistakes
the shrill of a back-door parrot for the
haughty note (G natural) of imperiousness,
by Tom Barry (Doone), a young artist.
The parrot’s male parent has kept her in
the dark as to the existence of an elder
daughter of his spotted past, and Thomas
arrives on the scene to explain to the old
pot the ripeness of the time for the true
heiress to come into her own. It is then
he _ meets Lady Mary, falls in love with her,
objects to her villainous suitor, jerks a yard
of cutlery into him on the duelling ground,
induces old Bannon to do the fair thing by
the outcast daughter, marries the parrot,
squares up generally, sings some more, and
so ends “Barry, of Ballypoor.”

Gallant Rescue in Castlereagii-street.
Elderly Woman Saved from Drowning.
Last Saturday night, at about 8 o’clock,
shrill cries for help were heard near the
Waters of Oblivion. A number of actors
and actresses, who happened to be in the
vicinity, dashed to the rescue, and, after
a great deal of trouble, managed to reach
the person in distress, who turned out to
be a middle-aged woman. She was carried
to the Theatre Royal, where she was re-
vived after three hours’ hafd singing and
dancing. Some old gags that were dis-
covered in the pocket of her dress were also
of great assistance. On recovering, she gave
her name as Dorothy, and stated that she
was on a visit from the country. She bad
been sitting on the beach thinking of old
times, when she was carried out by a wave
of popular approval. It is anticipated that
she will be well enough to leave for home
at the end of this week, when the illusionist,
Jansen, will take her place.


SARTO.
INJUNCTIONS AGAINST PASSING OFF.
LATEST CASE.—SCHWEPPES v. O’CONNOR.
In the Supreme Court, Queensland, before his Honor Mr. Justice Real and a jury of four.
(See Brisbane Couriers, August 27 to September 13, in which an Injunction was granted.)
During this case, which lasted 12 days, the following evidence was given, showing the
health-giving properties of Sarto and the amount of Sarsaparilla contained therein.
“George Alexander Byrn, member of the firm of Dixon and Byrn, assayers and
analysts, of Sydney, deposed that he had made analyses of a bottle of ‘Sarto’ and a
bottle of ‘Sarsa.’ He found that ‘Sarto’ contained 11.47 per cent, of solids, .108 of
simllicia, and the balance consisted of water and a small quantity of alcohol. ‘Sarsa’
contained 11.15 of solids and .006 per cent, of similicia, and the balance consisted of
water and a small quantity of alcohol. There was, therefore, eighteen times .as
much similicia in ‘Sarto’ as there was in ‘Sarsa.’ Similicia was the active
principle of sarsaparilla; it was a medicinal tonic. There were other properties
of sarsaparilla of medicinal value, but the active principle was similicia.’
Mr. Feez: “How does ‘Sarto’ compare with ‘Sarsa’ according to your analysis?”
—“There is a finer quality of sarsaparilla in ‘Sarto’ than there is in ‘Sarsa.’ ” “Is
it correct to say that some sarsaparilla root may have no similicia at all?”—“Yes.”
“What does the presence of .108 per cent, of similicia indicate to you?’— “That
only the best sarsaparilla root has been used in the preparation.” “Is that a
large or a small quantity for a drink of that kind?”—“A very fair amount.”

and (8) trying to have them arrested for

he fools his little hour or two upon the
stage in ridiculous dread of the widow he is
about to marry, and, as a matter of fact,
does marry. His harmless visit to a gam-
bling club the night previous to his wedding
is the guilty secret he tries to withhold
from the widow. All the complications that
ever happened in half a dozen previous
American farcical comedies are crowded into
the Tomkins narrative. Owing to the luna-
tical interference of his bosom friend, Tom-
kins goes to prison, when he is understood
to be taking military honors in Cuba ; con-
sequently he returns to his honeymoon in a
misfit uniform, with medals dangling from
his epaulettes, and is carried off by mistake
to an asylum for the insane before he con-
fesses his utter foolishness. No vestige of
probability attaches to Tomkins or any of
the persons concerned in the hollow mockery
of a plot. Some of his antics are laughable
in their extravagant absurdity, but no note
of legitimate humor is struck during the
wearisome proceedings. One never knows
what may chance to “catch on” at the Bijou
these times, otherwise The Bulletin would
regard “What Did Tomkins Do?” on its

managerial regret. Corson Clarke works

ment with tact; Miss Cecilia Gold urges the

able results; and Jack Waller remains the
gent, of all work, aiding and abetting the

the whole co. shows its capacity for original
entertainment in sundry burlesques and
concerted numbers, whereof the condensed
“La Poupfie” is remembered by this paper
with grateful feelings.
“J.F.H.” (London): Bernard Shaw’s “Androeles
and the Lion” had a very mixed reception at its first
production, and it was hard to say whether the hoots
or the claps predominated. Bernard is naturally
displeased, and is saying some unpleasant things
about the dense stupidity of London audiences. But
it is so nearly impossible to make out what Shaw
really is driving at that the critic who called his
latest commotion “a queer amalgam of ‘The Sign of
the Cross’ and a Drury Lane pantomime” gets so
near the bull’s-eye that the difference doesn’t matter.
Years ago somebody tried to sell to the late Alfred
Dampier a play in which the last act was based on
the meeting of a lion and a giraffe beside a river in
France. If Shaw captured the rejected manuscript,
and threw in a Coliseum (Shaw can throw a Coli-
seum any day of the week), and some slaves and
Pontius Pilates, and a Caesar or two, and a cohort
or two, then the Androeles play would be accounted
for.
Sarah Bernhardt is back again at London Coliseum,
playing “The Woman of Samaria,” by Edmond Ros-
tand. In the original production Christ and the
Apostles were brought on the stage, but the censor
whispered something, so Sarah revised that scene and
cut the Saviour out. She now merely tells a jeering
crowd of her meeting with Him, and in the end she
converts them all with her eloquence, and trium-
phantly leads them to Jacob’s well, when she reckons
the audience has had its money’s worth and rings
the curtain down.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“0.K.”: “Do Moving Pictures Injure the Morals
of Youth?” is the question which Chief Secretary
John Weary has submitted to the police of Mel-
bourne and thereabouts. Some of the answers lean
to the affirmative, whilst several of them confuse the
issue by suggesting that the purity of the audience
would be less imperilled if the lights were not turned
down —which is a matter quite apart from the moral
tone of the pictures. One policeman bemoans the
prevalence on the screens of “representations of danc-
ing and criminal acts, sensational crimes and coarse
and clandestine love scenes.” Seeing that all these
things happen in ordinary melodrama, and that screen
sensations are rarely “warmer” than the chasing of
Mercia by Marcus in “Sign of the Cross,” there is
no reason why the silent picture show should be
specially condemned. Still, it is true enough that
some of the pictures shown in English-speaking coun-
tries would not be permitted in at least one part of
Europe. T. J. West, the estimable identity who in-
troduced first-class cinematography to Australia, was
passing through Melbourne recently, and he had some
interesting comments to make on the topical ques-
tion. “Picture manufacturers,” said he, “have no
more use for pernicious stories than reputable book
publishers have. The public do not want bad — -i.e.,
indecent or ‘penny dreadful’ —tales on the screen.
The business of the big firms is to supply only the
large demands. As for ‘morality,’ it varies with
geographical conditions. Robbery and murder t pic-
tures are censored in Germany, but in Russia they
are popular subjects. The Russians have a voracious
appetite for horrors, and dramas intended for that
country need gloomy endings to them. For a power-
ful picture-play which is prepared for the world’s
market, the stage-manager will arrange two or three
different versions. The love story which ends happily
in England will come to a sadly sentimental close in
the film intended for France, perhaps. The Russian
version of the same story will conclude with a sui-
cide or two. No two countries have quite the same
popular idea of injurious or non-injurious pictures;
but it is safe to say that none of the exporting manu-
facturers in any country cater for what comes under
the local definition of immoral taste.” The genial
T. J. West, by the way, looks not a day older than
when he first came to Australia, bringing an up-to-
date cinematograph show, along with some musical
entertainers—the Brescians. Fate was kind to him
then —and has been since. The business he founded
has prospered all the time, and he now sits placidly
on the board of directors, merely dangling his legs,
as it were. When he has a second to spare he collects
his dividends.
“X.Y.”: “Does Acting Pay” is the heading of an
article in a Melbourne paper:—
Does acting pay? We cannot say.
Perhaps it will, perhaps it won’t.
We only know that actors don’t.
Joseph McCabe, who recently concluded another
lecturing tour through Maoriland, reckoned it was
one of the most uncomfortable experiences since he
took up the business. Incidentally, it was one of the
most unprofitable. The rigorous winter conditions
were the drawback. He didn’t find one hall that
was fitted with artificial heating, and the cold in the
South was so great that such audiences as ventured
forth sat in the buildings wrapped in rugs and over-
coats while he chattered his teeth at them from the
platform. Even Esquimos wouldn’t turn up in herds
to hear a stranger’s teeth rapping out the story of the
end of the world.
Nellie Stewart’s daughter Nancy made her stage
debut, last Thursday, at St. James’s Hall, Sydney, in
a scene from Bulwer Lytton’s “Richelieu.” Nancy
was Julie de Mauprat. Walter Bentley, whose stu-
dents were providing the rest of the programme,
played the old Cardinal to whom Julie flies for pro-
tection from the King. Nancy has the healthy ap-
pearance of a country girl, and her fine arms looked
as if they could have thrown any Court trifler
through the buttery window. She was prettily
demure, with just a suggestion of her mother’s
natural winsomeness. Nellie herself, looking very
well, witnessed her debutante’s footlighting from the
back seat to which she doesn’t belong, and never will.
“Spasmode”: One Charles Dillon, of the histrionic
family, is announced to give a Melbourne recital of
“The Merchant of Venice.” There seem to have been
four Dillons in the succession. The first one' is
limned, after an amusing, fashion, by Coleman, in his
“Recollections.” This Dillon was in appearance a
combination of Chadband and Stiggins, but an ami-
able man, the drollest Coleman ever met. Maybe
Dickens’s' Job Trotter hit him off best. He seemed
to have been connected both with chapel and stage.
His son, cast in the same fatty mould, with upturned
nose, was that real genius Charles Dillon, the actor.
As Belphegor he made an overpowering hit at the
London Lyceum, and some will remember that splen-
did performance in Sydney and Melbourne. He was a
strange, reckless character, with all Brooke’s gener-
osity. Besides Belphegor, Australia may remember
him in Lear, lago, Louis XI., D’Artagnan and other
parts. His son William Dillon caine to Australia
about 14 years after the father, and starred a bit,
supported by his wife, Edith Pender. He subsided
into playing seconds to Creswick. The great Dillon,
with intensely natural acting, was a pioneer of
Fechter and Irving in giving the quietus to the
heavy style, as embodied in Macready, Phelps,
Brooke, Sullivan, Creswick and Anderson, though pre-
vious to Dillon’s arrival Charles Kean had consider-
ably lightened it.
Musical comedy has had a poor year at its head-
quarters, the London Gaiety, and there has been a
drop in the dividend from 20 to 10 p.c. The chair-
man told the shareholders that the bad business was
due to the war in the and the competition
of the revues in the variety houses. There was
derisive laughter when the Balkan War was dragged
into the matter, but the chairman declared that the
Stock Exchange and the financial folks were among
the leading patrons of the Gaiety, and a “distraction”
such as the flare-up in the Balkans did seriously
interfere with their regular theatre-going. One
shareholder butted in with the serious truth : “We shall
have to consider whether our class of entertainment—
musical comedy—has not had its day.” Several
other yelled “hear, hear.” “As an entertainment,”
said one of them, “the stuff we offer is now too thin. It
is merely pegs on which all sorts of things are hung;
the songs have frequently no connection with the piece,
whatever, and the play-going public is getting tired
of this go-as-you-please business.” And he went on
to argue with a lot of force that people who like a
disconnected show go to the variety houses for it,
which is no good to the Gaiety.

THE LADY: “Do you feel equal to doing the
Bunny Hug with me, Colonel Oldbird?”
OLDBIRD: “Madam, I am an Englishman
and a soldier."
A Melbourne matron, sueing her husband
for maintenance, informed the Bench that
he was “a good husband —very jolly and all
that —as long as she provided him with
everything and didn’t ask him for money.”
When she asked him to contribute to her
support, he had a nasty way of “flaring up.”
A jolly lot of jolly men are like that,
bmouldering fires of indignation lie hidden
under their bonhomie, and a request for cash
is the drop of kerosene which causes them
to flare up. In this case, by the way, the
defendant alleged that his wife had exhorted
him to “go to h—l and hang himself.” No
doubt he meant to convey that she was an
inconsiderate woman who urged him to do
a quite unnecessary amount of travelling
“Melb” : The Auditorium, nearly opposite,
has wakened up the Athenaeum, whose com-
mitteemen put forth a circular, explaining
that a change has come over the scene and
they are now alive. The Athenaeum has en-
joyed a Seven Sleepers’ snooze of half a
century. Its reading-room for most of that
time has presented a convocation of vener-
able alligators sunning themselves in mud.
Founded in 1839, it first pitched its camp on
the corner of Swanston and Latrobe streets,
now occupied by the Public Library. This
was too much out in the green fields, so the
Collins-street site was bought for £285. The
back part, to Little Collins-street, now part
of the Victoria Coffee Palace premises, was
sold many years later at a large profit. The
Athenseum used to be called the Mechanics’
Institute, but changed to the more Marma-
dukish name in 1872, when the new hall was
built. The first “Mechanics’ Institute,”
built in 1843, cost £1921, and was claimed to
be “the noblest edifice in the Province.”
This did duty unchanged for nigh 30 years.
The hall then put up cost £7000; and in
1885 the facade cost £10,485. Alderman
Mowbray gave the statue of Minerva atop,
but it does not stick out like Mercury over
the Age office. This Mercury, by the way,
was imported for the Commercial Bank in
Melbourne; but when the money went it
was remembered, no doubt, that Mercury
was of old a thief as well as the god of trade,
and the inference seemed too pointed.

Since Australia took over the control of
the lighthouses, people have been finding out
what a casual sort of service the States pro-
vided. During a debate on the dark ques-
tion, last week, Sinclair, of Bananaland, told
the House that a woman of Russell Island, in
his northern electorate, had earned the grati-
tude of seamen by hanging out a light every
night for 30 years past. The Australian
Government is just finding out these glim-
mering facts, and it has a large lamplighting
job ahead of it. Unfortunately, Captain
Cook is. so busy keeping his own craft off
the rocks that he hasn’t much time to spare
for more venturesome mariners. The Sam-
aritan of Russell Island will have to keep
the candle burning in the window for a few
more years, until. the statesmen are through
with one another’s characters and have time
to attend to their jobs. By the way, Vic-
toria used to have a notable lighthouse in
the window of the pub on top of Mount St.
Bernard, over 5000 ft. above sea-level. In
the winter, when the roads and precipices
were obliterated by snow, and the avalanche
clamored, and the dingo was hungry, the
light in the friendly pub burned all night,
and he who was lost on the road from Omeo
to Harrietville saw it, and rejoiced. And if
he was very cold or very much lost on
Razorback he made for the house, and woke
up the kindly owner, and had a drink and a
feed and a bed. If he had money he paid,
and if he had none he left his IO U. So the
philanthropist of the pub-lighthouse by the
roadside didn’t make much money.
Victorian Training College lecturer Shar-
man has a pet idea. He thinks that after
the young Australian has reached the age of
12 he should not have to worry his head
with multiplication
and division sums. His
idea is that each in-
fant should possess a
calculating slide-rule
which should be al-
lowed to accompany
its owner to exams,
and such like. The
slide-rule certainly is
a .brainy instrument.
With one six inches
long you could calcu-
late the circumference
of George Reid to the
nearest inch, while
with an instrument a
foot long you could
find without trouble
how much the Ma
State has borrowed
from Uncle in the
last 10 years. To find
out how much it will
repay in the next 20
, years you use that
other much more common instrument, the
let-it-slide rule.

Yet another imported “expert” has fallen
in. It now transpires that the site chosen by
Merz (he was appealed to by the Vic. Rail-
way Commissioners) for the suburban rail-
ways electric powerhouse is not only unsuit-
able, but impossible. The said site is at
Yarraville, on the bank of the Saltwater
River. But there isn’t a sufficiently vigor-
ous flow of water in that pellucid stream
for condensing purposes. The tide, acting
on the sluggish stream, would force the once-
used warm water back into the suction pipes,
where its temperature would make it abso-
lutely useless a second time. So the power-
house is. to be put at Newport, where the
xarra will give a better supply, and the re-
taining wall serve to separate the intake
supply from the outlet. Merz, by the way
is an engineer. It is as if an architect put
Oregon girders into a bridge where iron ones
were needed.
A self-balancing aeroplane model, the
invention of engineer G. B. Austin, of
Victorian Public Works Department,
lately went through satisfactory trials
over the paddocks around Digger’s Rest,
in the Weary State. The engine is
placed amidships, well under the frame;
there are propellers both fore and aft, and
one plane is behind the other; but the guar-
antee of stability under all circumstances is
a pendulum balance attachment, working on
a universal joint, and so connected with the
planes as to bring them back whenever they
are diverted from the horizontal position.
The adult machine is intended to carry pas-
sengers on a platform or cage itself part of
the pendulum balance; thus the heavier the
load the greater the stability.

The story of the Victorian herbalist who
was fined £3O because he falsely described
certain pills as containing no minerals or
drugs” is interesting, not on account of a
quack actually being fined, but in regard to
the resulting proceedings. His subsequent
appeal was allowed, the judge’s decision be-
ing that pills did not come within the mean-
ing of the Pure Fond Act unrl n m«e
stated for the Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court decided that pills were not an article
of food within the meaning of the original *
Act, but that Act had been amended. Under
the amendment, pills were covered lv the

Supreme Court upheld the original convic-

AN OUTRAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir, —In the paragraph headed “From the Galler-
ies’’ in 3'esterday’s issue of the Daily Telegraph, the
small attendance of ladies in the galleries at the
Federal banquet is referred to. I had six tickets sent
me, but could only prevail upon one of my friends
to accompany me. The others all refused for the
above reasons. And the one who did come went to
sleep, because looking on made her feel hungry and
exhausted.—Yours, etc., -— —. -— A lady’s letter to
the suffering editor, who had nothing to do with it.
It is the woman who is wooed
With masses of expensive food.
Rich chocolates and morning tea
Ensnare Respectability,
While oysters and good bottled stout
Enslave the girl who “knocks about,”
And hunts the good time night and day,
Regardless of what people say.
On fruit, and sweets, and sparkling wine,
On cake and turkeys go and dine,
If you would win the maiden fair
Who looks as if she lived on air.
She doesn’t! Go and watch her eat
Soup, fish and entree —roast and sweet.
Observe her while she chews her way
Right through the list. Then go and pay.
Upon the marble altar place
The cash for what she fed her face;
Then think it over carefullee
Before it’s time for cake and tea.
(Between whiles you, of course, will buy
Some chocolates, for she would die,
If she went out on pleasure bent
Without a box of nourishment).
Most girls eat seven times a day,
With various extras by the way ;
Whatever be her passing mood,
She’ll always look at well-cooked food.
So, when in doubt re what to say,
Don’t say it! Lead her straight away
To food. Where words won’t bring relief,
Go, put your trust in cutlets, beef,
Or steak and oysters ! Work your jaws
On food, while victuals plead your cause
And bring her to her bearings. Yes !
For all her fairy loveliness,
And all her pretty-pretty talk,
She wields a skilful knife and fork,
And knows the sor,t of things to drink.
He is a perfect fool, I think,
Who offers her a lofty seat
Where she may watch while others eat!

RABBIT TRAPPING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At dusk goes Billy, tall and strapping,
A shadow in the tea-tree gaps.
And now I hear his hammer tapping,
And now a startled pigeon flapping,
And now a chain, that clinks and claps
And Billy goes around his traps.
I see a curtained window flaring,
And Billy, too, is watching there;
But innocent —perhaps not caring
That someone else is traps preparing,
and Lucy Anna’s chiefest snare
Is woven of her yellow hair.

Apparently the Victorian police are not
merely incapable of catching criminals: they
can t even hold them. The other day a 16-
year-old damsel charged with till-rifling, was
ieft by a Sandringham sleuth in the office
of the local police-station, what time he (the
sleuth) went to get her a drink of water
She preferred liberty to the liquid, however,
and repaid the wretched official’s kindliness
by walking out, and so into the unknown.
A day later a Ballarat confinee, who had
been left m the lockup yard while the con-
stable went to the ’phone, casually scaled an
eight-foot iron fence and went about his
business; and the same day a much-desired
Carlton (Vic.) resident, brought from Mel-
bourne Gaol, and lined up with others in the
City Court yard, walked through a door
reserved for Gentlemen One and others of
like calling He is still walking. It is little
incidents like these that make Melbournites
doubt the brain-power of their uniformed
protectors these and the facts that onlv
about one murderer in 10 appears ever to
be apprehended within a 10-mile radius of
Golhns-street.

“Binnacle” : According to the unconfirmed
theory cabled out, the inferno on the Vol-
turno in mid-Atlantic was due to the firing
of a consignment of carbide of calcium. Car-
bide is acetylene gas in solid form, and if it
gets wet is a deadly neighbor. The British
Board of Trade absolutely prohibits the
carriage of carbide on emigrant ships, and.
unless the fact that the Volturno loaded at
Rotterdam affects the question, there will
be a wide margin for explanation if carbide
was part of the cargo. On ordinary pas-
senger ships carbide is carried under most
stringent conditions; usually it is trans-
poi ted about the world in cargo steamers
it being a fundamental principle of British
maritime law that the lives of British sea-
men are of small account (they are mostly
Dagoes and Chows, anyhow). An outstand-
mg feature of this latest marine hor-
ror was the efficacy of oil on devilish seas.
Oil on troubled waters” is neither
new in theory nor in practice (every
lifeboat has an oil jar on board),
was the first occasion that
** “V^ h century oil tank steamer had tamed
that old. roaring lunatic Neptune with a
dose of 50 tons of the stuff. All the same
there was considerable risk to the rescuing
boats in pouring out all that oil to wind-
ward of a blazing vessel.
A BALE’S DLFFERENCE.
"Why do you think I wouldn't suit as your

“ Well, you see , one
thing , you've got yel-
low hair , and my
wife's a broo-nette."
The Swan Hill Courthouse, a weather-
board relic of Victoria’s bad old bushranging
days, has just been shifted to the outskirts
of the township, where it will serve as a
plain dwelling, till it falls into final disre-
pair. Fifty-odd years ago, when this court-
house was built, Swan Hill was the centre
of an extensive police beat, and hairy men,
with firearms concealed about their outfit,
were frequently invited inside to explain dis-
crepancies in their conduct. A few oldest
inhabitants are left who can remember
such things, and they stood around and remin-
isced whilst the obsolete stronghold of
lawanorder was removed at the tail of two
dozen bullocks.

cally from time to time that madness was in the
family; that the aged nobleman’s penchant for the

yould have died respected by the world, if not by his
immediate associates. Sievier himself sustained the
sev ? res t blow of his career as a result of a libel
action. At a time when he owned Sceptre (one of
the greatest mares in the history of racing), and was
a prominent figure in the racing world, and was on
( be very verge of being endured socially, a misguided
tr iend brought him into the Raleigh Club. Sir James
tiuke, a member, objected on the ground that Sievier
was not fit to enter any club. Sievier sued him for
libel, only to find that Duke knew too much. As a
direct consequence the unhappy plaintiff was warned
the Turf. Also, his character was held up to
public reprobation. Evidently Percy Bono, solicitor,
and Thomas Dey, bookmaker (who were the assail-
a T ntß of n E £ eTi ? r in ,ds lat ,? st ™ w) ’ J esembl f
James Duke, inasmuch as they knew too much. It
is a fatal thing to bring a libel action against one
who knows too much. In fact, it is a mad act to
bring such a suit against one who knows anything,

According to a recent cablegram:—
London, Monday Evening.—The Divorce Court has
granted Viscount Ingestre a declaration of legiti-
maey. He was born four months after Mrs. Mundy
married his father. Viscount Ingestre was born on
September 8, 1882, being the only son of the 20th
Earl of Shrewsbury.
Tbe matter seems hardly worth all that
space. Away back in the days of the
Crusaders, an English nobleman went away
to batter the Mohammedans in Palestine,
and never came back. A son was born
thirty months after he left England, and
the Church, after fighting several rounds with
its conscience, decided that the offspring was
legitimate. It might seem a strenuous item,
but nobody cabled to Australia about it.
Ex-Bishop Frod-
sham, who did good
work for Australia in
North Queensland, and
is now trying to do it
in England, has just
been viciously at-
tacked by United
Empire for daring to
speak hopefully and well of the
Commonwealth’s attempt to
keep the North white. But
Dr. Frodsham probably won’t
worry when he knows what
sort of review United Em-
pire is. It is the organ of the
Royal Colonial Institute —the
latter a “superior” concern
founded in 1868 by a few Lon-
don-Australians who shied at
the blackball system of the
London clubs of those days. It
has an imposing building in
the West End, filled with all
sorts of things except the usual
appurtenances of a comfortable
club. Once a month the “Fel-
lows” hold a stodgy dinner at
the Hotel Metropole opposite,
and entertain as guest some
alleged “Master Builder of
Greater Britain,” like Willy
Watt, Newton Moore, o r
lOUseph Ward. The guest
reads a speech, punctuated
with lantern slides and snores
from the overfed audience. No-
body under a C.M.G. is ever
asked on the platform, and the
virtue of the show is its cheap-
ness. The Institute has never
done anything for the Empire,
it has never headed any Colonial
or Imperial movement. Yet it calmly pur-
sues its policy of prate, prate, prate about
United Empiah and the need for doing
something to cement the bonds. The
Institute seems to have a mighty poor
opinion of the bonds, judging by the num-
ber of coats of cement it seems to think
necessary.

A significant “Christian endeavor” item
from the little town of Clunes (Vic.) :
Some of the ladies who have done the collecting
for the annual hospital carnival for several years
past declare that they will not collect if it is to be
a straight-out giving instead of a carnival.
If local Sassiety be denied the annual carni-
val excitement, the hospital can whistle for
its money-box angels. The old, allegorical
female figure of Charity, in sad robes and
a pained expression, is quite out of date.
Imagination depicts her nowadays as a
fancy-dressed lady with a ball at her feet.

The desperate struggle to prove Port
Phillip an honest harbor, fit to receive a
battleship, continues. Meanwhile, some
honest man has won a round of silence for
himself by suggesting that it would be
criminal folly to risk smashing the new
Australia rt the Heads when the fine, deep
harbor of Westernport is available. Of
course, nobody wants the £2,000,000 ship at
Westernport; if it comes to Victoria at all,
it will have to be edged into the authorised
skimming dish harbor and shoved up through
the mud and sand to Port Melbourne —-or as
close thereto as possible. Meanwhile, the
usual British expert is hurrying out to have
a look at the dangerous entrance, for the
limit has been reached, and the eleventh
hour has passed, and Premier Watt is talk-
ing heroically in this fashion : “The under-
taking is without parallel in the Southern
Hemisphere, but we strongly feel that no
barriers calculated to adversely affect the
maritime interests of our great and growing
trade should be allowed to exist.”
For a change, the State’s Frights’ Minis-
try of N. S. Wales is standing by the Aus-
tralian Government? True, it concerns a
very small matter, but, then, with the ex-
ception of its pyramidical loan policy and
pile of broken pledges, the llolman-McGowen
crowd deals only in small matters. Slow
Train Commissioner Johnson some time ago
called upon the Federal authorities to quit
the site of the Custom House at New-
castle, which the Railway Department
claims, so that he could remove the premises
thereon for railway expansion purposes.
In addition to the Customs, a number of
State officers occupy the building, and, as
the stony Ma Ministry has nowhere to place
them in the event of eviction by landlord
Johnson, the said busted conglomeration is
not supporting its gravel train Czar. This
isn’t worrying Johnson. He has hitched
his case _to the flying tortoise of the law,
and applied for an order which will throw
the Commonwealth into the street.
“0.K.”: Melb. Argus, quoting the
exuberant George Reid and patting that
earnest feeder approvingly on his stummick,
declares that “to possess a good inside is
more than half the success in life. It is
man’s whole existence.” “A good inside”
may be the whole existence of an overfed
politician; but a particularly weak and
troublesome inside doesn’t prevent a De
Quincey from doing great work. De Quincey,
in fact, may be said to owe his fame to his
highly unsatisfactory stomach. How absurd,
then, for the Argus and George Reid to
assert that the “inside” of a persistent
gourmand is “man’s whole existence”! It
is only one sort of man’s whole existence,
and there are several sorts, even of the in-
tellectual type. The difference between a
lean, aesthetic Ruskin and a loud, fat Reid
is that one is nearer to the gods and the
other is nearer to the gorge.

“Pittsie” Ryan, one of the alleged round-
the-world pedestrians now infesting Aus-
tralia, recently managed to walk round a
term of gaol by entering into a bond to be
of good behavior for 12 months, and refunding
part of the money that was in the purse when
he borrowed it from a Broadford (Vic.)
hotel. The next international tramp who
arrives and informs Broadford that he is
walking round the world will be so cheered
and invigorated by his reception that he
will start to do the next stage of his trip at
a run. No honest man has got time to walk
round the world, and no sensible man wants
to try.
THE BLOOD BOND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We in Australia consider that we are a great and
important nation; but that fact to the public of
Great Britain has no special interest. Our great
drawback is that Australia has been singularly free
from crime. From the English readers’ point of
view, a first-class crime would be the thing. It
would direct more attention to Australia than the
fact of her rapid growth as a nation. —George Reid.
’Tis sad indeed; but George, who knows,
Declares, alas! it is too true
The dear old Mother Country shows
No interest in me and you !
The story of our progress fails
Our Ma’s attention kind to win'!
What she requires is hefty tales
Concerning gallows, courts and gaols;
In short, she wants that touch of sin
That makes her piebald Empire kin!
Than water, blood is thicker far,
And we “colonials,” who yearn
To win the influence of Ma,
This lesson must proceed to learn.
A high-class murder’s bound to make
A hit with Ma, across the seas;
In this an interest she’ll take,
And love us for our corpse's sake;
For, lo! ’tis crimson ties like these
Bind England to the “colonies” !

You’ll stumble on the young Australian
picking up experience in the most unexpected
places. One of them was in the engine-
room of the Volturno when that vessel came
to grief in the Atlantic the other day ; he’s
a son of R. W. Belfield, secretary of the
Mount Morgan Co. (Q.). The good luck
that made him an Australian stuck to him,
and he was among the handful whom the
Kroonland rescued.
A FORGOTTEN PRINCIPAL.

Something about the Stubbs family :
Died at Mosman (N.S.W.), Mrs. Rosina Mary
Fitzstubbs, widow of Robert Fitzstubbs, a once well-
known auctioneer of Melbourne and Sydney. The old
lady was 82. The husband, who died many years
ago, was the son of Thomas Stubbs—he did not use
the Fitz —a portly Georgian auctioneer who left Syd-
ney in the 40 s of last century and settled in Mel-
bourne. His facial resemblance to George IV. was
remarkable—or otherwise, according to whether a
story, current in those days was credited or not.
Anyway, Stubbs, or Fitzstubbs, as the case may be,
was a genial social favorite, full of anecdote, and as
an auctioneer of the ornate order had no rival. He
died in 1878. Mrs. Fitzstubbs was born in Hunter-
street, Sydney, in a house (long demolished) which
stood on the site of Union Bank Chambers. She had
12 children, including the musical Maud Fitzstubbs,
now in England.
Another of Maoriland’s scholarly men
crossed Jordan last week. That was
Augustus Hamilton, director of the Colonial
Museum since 1903, when the distinguished
James _ Hector dropped out. Hamilton ar-
rived in M.L. 37 years ago, and took up
teaching as a profession. In 1890 he was
lifted to the job of Registrar in Otago Uni-
versity, and followed on to the Museum. The
ancient Maori was a hobby that made him
famous in the aboriginal literature of Aus-
tralasia and further out.
Harry Levien, “father” of the N.S.W. As-
sembly, got into his 65th year last
week. He was born at Singleton in 1841).
Levien has represented Tamworth and
Quirindi, practically one seat, in 13 conse-
cutive Parliaments, a matter of 33 years.
This is a record for the State. Henry Parkes
was in 16 Parliaments, but he represented
10 constituencies ; and John Robertson, who
sat in 12 Parliaments, had seven different
seats. Solemn Lee, of Tenterfield, sat in 12,
and Dr. Ross, and Burns, and Brunker in
10 without a change ; and Bill Lyne repre-
sented the Hume nine times in the Assembly
and four times in the House of Reps. It
is rumored, by the way, that Levien is really
going to push his Totalisator Bill through
next session.

weatth Bank.
Gone out on
the last tide, J.
G. Dunlop, man-
aging director of
John Brown and
Co., the Clyde-

shipbuilders and
engineers. Dun-
lop’s fame runs
to the outermost
corners of the
Seven Seas. He
was superinten-
dent engineer of
the Orient line
away back in
1819, and intro-
duced triple-ex-
pansion engines
to the Australian
service; and he
was the first man
to fix up ’board-
ship refrigerators
for providing pas-
sengers with friz
food. That links
him with a past

Percy Col-
quhoun, an old-
time Sydney
’Varsity athlete
and crack foot-
ball player of N.
S. Wales, has
secured the Lib-
eral selection for
Mosman, which is
one of the new
electorates that
Wade is depend-
ing on to bring
. . him back his lost
majority. The new candidate married
1 hcebe Howitt, of Melbourne, who for
many years was Victoria’s lady tennis
champion. So, as Shakspeare truly
observed: “The quality of Percy is not
strained.’ In fact, that gentleman may fall
on W ade like the gentle dew from Heaven.
A man of some size and picturesque
aspect has passed out in Sydney. The Rev.
William Marcus Dill Macky * was a good
Presbyterian bigot from Donegal (Ulster,
Ireland). He saw Popes in his sleep, and
Escaped Nuns in his waking hours. He was
chased bv mad Vaticans. It was hardly
possible for a tramcar to run over a dog
within 10 miles of him without his suspi-
cions being aroused that the dog was
a Protestant animal which had barked on
the walls of Derry in the time of Wm. 111.,
and that the driver of the car was a dis-
guised Cardinal who was saying mass on
the vehicle. Dr. Dill Macky was an eloquent
preacher at the Scots Church, Sydney, and
was, so far as this writer is aware, the only
clergyman in Australia who wore no trou-
sers. _ He didn’t assume the kilt, but
disguised his southern extremities in knee-
breeches and calves and stockings. Some
years ago a Pope sent a minion all the way
from Rome to stick a hatpin in the calves
and discover if they were padded, but the
agent, who was a Unitarian, died of beer
on the road. Furthermore, the deceased
clergyman was a learned theologian and a
man of large culture, but like all fanatics
he was strangely credulous in his own
especial line of fanaticism. A kindly,
generous Christian with a kink—that is
Dill Mackv’s epitaph.
Of new Australian wine and old Scotch
bottles: —
At Munro, Gippsland (Vic.), on October 6, Mr.
Peter Clark, aged 84, was married to Miss Boccius,
aged 69. The officiating voice was breathed by the
Rev. Roberts, aged 85. The best man, Mr. Peter
Martin, was 82. The bridegroom wore the black coat
in which he was married to his first wife, and in
which, with her, he celebrated his golden wedding.
Dying shortly after that event, the lady named her
successor; and Peter obeyed. The Clarks came to
Gippsland from Scotland after the Battle of Bannock-
burn, and they and the coat of Scotch tweed have
been there ever since. That was why the bridegroom
just mentioned didn’t carry a spear at Flodden. The
war broke out so suddenly that he failed to arrive
in time, though his intentions were of the best. If
he had been at Flodden an English archer would
probably have shot the tail of the coat and killed it
on the spot.
“Scoffer” : I love the careful and reverent
way the daily paper speaks of royalties and
semi-royalties. In connection with the Con-
nauglit-Pife wedding, my favorite daily re-
cently supplied a few sensational facts about
the escape of the young Duchess of Fife and
her people from the wreck of the Delhi in
1911. The story walked backwards in this
fashion: “While the ship’s boat was some
distance from the shore, it suddenly filled
and sank. The Duke and Duchess and
Princess Alexandra (as she then was) and
Princess Maud were all flung into the
water.” Observe how the climax is post-
poned while the title is explained. Maud
seems to hit the water about five minutes
after the rest of the family have disappeared
beneath the foam. Try an historical para-
graph in the same style: “Brutus snatched
up his sword (he was then going bald) and
thrust it into Caesar’s side.” And an
Evening Bloodstain tragedy: “She
(as she then was) rushed to meet her hus-
band, and was immediately felled with a
heavy blow on the jaw. His name was
Brown.”
“Jeames”: Without a doubt the daily
papers are a dashed informative lot. Sydney
Sun, for example, printed this last week :
In opening the winter session of the Gaelic League
in London yesterday Lord Ashbourne, formerly Lord
Chancellor of Ireland, said that the real English
tongue could never be the Irish tongue.
John Bull, he went on to say, was the most preju-
diced, insular, narrow-minded, impossible person the
world had ever seen. Anyone going to the Continent
knew what an utterly incapable fool his representa-
tive was when he met him. He looked for his own
language and customs, and complained when he
failed to find them.
The best way for Ireland to be progressive, added
Lord Ashbourne, would be for its people to speak
their own language.
Lord Ashbourne was never Lord Chancellor
of Ireland, though his father was. The
humor of the Sun’s cable, to us of the Ser-
vants’ Hall who know, lies in the fact that
the late Chancellor was the very last man
on earth to voice the sentiments that he is
here accused of holding. He was an Irish
Tory, a Unionist, and an enthusiastic hater
of the all-for-Ireland business in every one of
its manifestations. The present Lord Ash-
bourne was practically disinherited by his
reactionary parent on account of his poli-
tical views. He is a Home Ruler, a firm
believer in the future possibilities of his
native land —in fact, he is everything that
his father wasn’t. He is brilliantly clever,
but consumption has menaced him from
youth up. For years he had to live at St.
Moritz, in Switzerland, in order to keep
body and soul together, and now he is a
middle-aged man, and the chances that he
will ever, do much with his brains are small.
A. M. Myers, who, the other day, added to
a long list of patriotic gifts to Aucklanders
(M.L.) by passing £9OOO to the municipal
council towards making a park in the midst
of the city, is an Australian by birth. Forty-
six years ago he was born in Ballarat, but
early left for Maoriland, and quickly climbed
to wealth and political position. At 16
years of age he started work; six months
later he was manager of the Auckland branch
of the business he had entered (it was no
slouch of a business, either). Then he
turned a roving eye on speculations that
made his bankers spurt on dividend days,
was Mayor of Auckland three or four times,
M.H.R. (still is), and Minister in the Ward
Administration. Also, he has a name on the
prize-winning records of the athletic fields
(footballer, swimmer, oarsman, bowler), and
was a major of volunteers. Of course, there
are lots of other things he did, but those
mentioned are particularly interesting, as he
attended to most of them in his spare time.
JOE’S A TTITUDE.
“If the House doesn’t do more business than it is
doing now,” said Mr. Cook, “I shall be ashamed to
accept my salary.”
This would be the proper
attitude to adopt in the
circumstances.

THE LATE REV. DR. DILL MACKY.
Baronet Robert Lucas Tooth and his wife
are passengers by the Osterley from London.
They will stay in Melbourne over Cup week,
and then come on to Sydney and camp at
the Australia. This Tooth is the son of
Edwin, who built Cranbrook, now the
State Governor’s residence: he named
it after his native place in Kent.
While he was still personally running
the family brewery, IL L. Tooth con-
tested East Sydnev (in 1879), against
Dr. Renwick, but was defeated in a sectarian
and beer scrimmage. However, Monaro re-
turned him in 1880, and he rewarded Monaro
by running large numbers of sheep in that
district ever since.
Doris Egerton Jones, an Adelaide young
woman, is blushing to find a book of hers,
“Peter Piper,” boomed in London, where
Cassell’s published it. The authoress, wha
is 23, became Adelaide’s first lady lawyer
almost as soon as she ceased to be an infant.
A. H. Peake got a special Bill through the
Legislature permitting women lawyers to
practise, and just as a great career of Costs
was opening out before her she fell ill, and a
doctor sternly adjourned the pursuit sine
die. She knows a bit about surgery (her
uncle and guardian is Dr. Fischer), learnt
Greek for a hobby, and recently stunned
Adelaide by denouncing the immorality of
mixed bathing. But, for all that, she is a
winsome maid and exactly unlike what is
demanded by comic artists of the suffragette
and the lady Wowser. She confesses that she
is still young enough to enjoy knucklebones
and recently scared a pressman to death by
suggesting a friendly game.
HIS PHYSICAL BASIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If I had not possessed a magnificent interior, I
should not have been alive- to-day.... To possess a
good inside is half the success of life. . . .1 pity those
men with magnificent minds and no physical attri-
butes. They should not have been sent into the
world. One must have a good physical basis to suc-
ceed. — George Reid.
He sits behind his noble binge,
And smiles upon a fruitful globe ;
His chin is fitted on a hinge,
A circus tent his upper robe ;
His nether garments do adhere
To clothe a spacious hemisphere.
“Behold!” he cries, “ye thin effete,
The fat men are the Lord’s elite.
A monument,
I represent
The might and majesty of meat!
Those wretched fellows who have brains,
And no material attributes,
Must suffer long, dyspeptic pains,
And be most uncongenial brutes ;
But those whose stomachs swell like Gog’s,
Or mine, dear friends, are jolly dogs.
To them success will always bring
The keenest raptures poets sing—
The bloated, grand,
Great waisted band,
The men who stomach anything!
All that I am I owe to meat;
’ Digestion ’tis that pulls me through.
If trial comes I sit and eat,
And so all troubles I eschew.
In pain, or weariness, of doubt,
I mark my way, and eat me out.
The gods two gifts to man bequeath,
Good stomach and opposing teeth.
Heed not philosophers who fiddle
With life’s tormenting, psychic riddle,
But eat your pie,
And keep, as I,
Your solid basis in your middle.

'these figures are cordially commended to those de-
positors who were induced to say “Hooray!” when
che State savings banks, hitherto carried on at the
post offices, decided not to transfer themselves to the
Commonwealth, along with the post offices. As soon
as the Commonwealth decided that, since it con-
trolled the post office, it ought also to control the
post-office savings banks, this and other State con-
cerns moved out into premises of their own or estab-
lished agencies in private shops and offices. The new
branches had, of course, to be manned; hence the
jump from £88,870 to £105,295 in management
exes, in the past year. Hence also in part the slump
in profits from £34,353 in 1911 to £21,515 in
1911 and away down to £12,994 in the past year.
1 or such of the slump in profits as the bigger man-
agement expenses have not produced, the struggle to
get big deposit figures by paying interest on an-
other £lOO (the maximum is now £350) is re-
sponsible. In an ordinary business the public may
benefit by the competition of two or more private
enterprises, for the competition may mean that the
private enterprises, besides putting more brains into
the business, may be content with much smaller pro-
fits. But nobody is out after profits in connection
with a savings bank. The depositors practically own
the bank and all that it can make; and, as in a co-
operative society, what they are concerned about is
to secure cheap and efficient management. To hire
two men to do one man’s work, and to put up two
offices where one would answer the is not
cheap and efficient management; it simply means a
reduction in the profits—the profits that belong to
the depositors. In 1910 the average cost of 100
transactions (deposits or payments) was 48s. 4d. In
the past year, when there were two offices competing
for the same job, it wa.s 575. 6d. The depositors
had to pay that extra 9s. 2d.—-either they or the
people who borrow from the bank. The interest
allowed has been 3} p.c. up to £lOO and 3 p.c. on
anything from £lOO to £350. Considering the
high value of monev in the past year, the rate paid
should have been more and the amount of profit put
by should still have been greater. It doesn’t seem
too much to say that £25,000 went in exes, that
should have been wholly unnecessary.
The past year hasn’t been a particularly bright
one for Victoria; nevertheless the total of deposits
has continued to grow:—
1902 .. £10,131,604 | 1908 .. £13,428,676
1903 . . 10,341,857 | 1909 . . 14,101,710
1904 . . 10.582,808 j 1910 . . 15,417,888
1905 .. 10,896,741 | 1911 .. 17.274M24
1906 .. 11,764,179 | 1912 .. 19,662,466
1907 . . 12,792,590 | 1913 . . 21,565,924
lor 32 years the maximum credit balance on which
any one private depositor was allowed interest was
250. With the Commonwealth Bank in the dis-
tance and approaching fast, the limit was increased
to £350 ; and that no doubt accounts for a big lump
of the extra deposits that were got last year. From
any point of view, however, the increase from
£10,131,604 in 1902 to £21,565,924 in 1913 is
splendid. It is a fine commentary on the alleged
thriftlessness of this generation of Australians. Also,
it is a fine commentary on tl' frequent lie that the
working man is no better off on Le wages he gets now
than he was on the much poo. i wages he got years
ago. His total Victorian savings in this bank prior
to 1903 were 10 millions odd. In the past 10 years
he has added 11 millions odd. His lay-by in 10
years has thus been greater than he had managed in
all his previous 40 years.
Including reserves, etc., the bank has £22,095,651
of funds; and it had the money out as follows on

A trifle over 71 p.c. of the lot is in State Govern-
ment stock and other public securities—which, of
course, explains why the State Government was so
clamorous for State control. Under anybody else’s
control it wouldn’t have so free a run of the till.
During the year the biggest percentage increase has
been in loans to the Advances Department (from
£1,311,750 to £1,973,164). This is an outcome
of the comparatively new departure by which the
lending branch (Credit Foncier) is permitted to
finance people who want money on shops and dwell-
ings ; prior to 1910 it was only the farmer who
could be obliged. The demand for the new class of
property mortgages is so great that' it looks as
though, after all, there won’t be as much in the till
for the State Government to play with as some
people had expected.

There is some doubt about the last line. This is the
position. The Department raises most of its money
on 3} p.c. debentures* which, of course, it has to
issue at a discount. That is to say, it gets about £95
and has to repay £lOO. Money having been dearer
than usual during the past year or two and the bor-
rowings large, the aggregate of the discounts has
been heavy. In order to pay out £lOO when only
£95 has been received, it is necessary to gradually
add profit to the £95. This contribution is really
in lieu of interest; if the Department borrowed at
4 p.c. or a little over, it wouldn't have to put by a
contribution towards wiping out the discount. In
the foregoing table the discount, thus far unpro-
vided for, is not regarded as an asset —which it cer-
tainly isn’t. Twelve months ago the accumulation
of profit towards providing for the discount was
£29,647. The past year’s contribution was £6591.
Total, £36,238. Nevertheless in this yearjs accounts
the discounts provided for are alleged to be £19,866.
Which means that either £16,372 of the old pro-
vision has somehow or other been lost or written
off, or the loss on the sale of debentures has been
that much greater than would appear from a com-
parison of this year’s figures with those of the year
before.

The big increase in the mortgage figures during the
past couple of years is due to the Department’s new
power to lend on shop and dwelling properties. This
shows the farm and other advances separately:—
Farm. Shop and House.

1912 . . . . 1,343,492 653,113

Already, as indicating the demand for the general
property loans, there are 4063 of the latter as
against 3350 of the farm advances ; and the manager
reports that new loans are being made in the general
division at the rate of 45 (say £15,000) per week.
When the new business was first taken it was done
at 4} p.c. ; twelve months ago the rate was raised
to 5 p.c., and, considering the risks, that leaves an
insufficient margin for contingencies. A profit of
£11,094, out of which about £7OOO has to be taken
to extinguish the discount, leaving a true profit of
little more than £4OOO, is distinctly not enough to
cover the risks there are in lending £2,600,000 of
money, nearly one-half of it being loans made on
shop and house property at a time when values of
shop and house property are inflated.

The law which authorised the Advances to Settlers
Office in 1894 has undergone many changes. The
latest of importance, in 1909, made the Office one
of the three branches of the State-Guaranteed Ad-
vances Department. Each year there may be bor-
rowed for advances (1) to settlers, £1,500,000;
(2) to workers, £750,000 ; and (3) to local autho-
rities, £1,000,000. For some invisible reason an
alleged sinking fund is provided for, and into this
fund 1 p.c. has to be paid “out of the advances
account” to the Public Trustee. In other words,
the “sinking fund” for wiping out the debt consists
of other debt, wherefore it is no more a sinking
fund than it is a flying-fish. The loans have been
raised mostly at a discount, which has been very
heavy during the past couple of years. This, of
course, means that the office pays a low rate of in-
terest, whereby the profits are inflated, and the true
profits are only arrived at by making a deduction on
account of the discount. Apparently the Office at
once writes off the whole of the discount on the
year’s flotations; hence, while those loans are cur-
rent, future years will get the benefit of the ab-
normally low interest.
Loans are made to settlers up to £2500, and 44
p.c. interest is charged for prompt payment. it
wouldn’t be. possible to do it if the transactions
weren t large and the expense rate low. This shows:

It’s a great thing for the Maoriland battler on the
land. As usual, though, some of the gilt has been
taken off the gingerbread, the price of land being
pushed up in many instances simply because the pur-
chaser of a farm can get cheap money. You have to
get up pretty early in the morning to stop the big
man from getting the benefit of schemes devised for
the help of the little man. As a rule the loans are
made for 36} years. One per cent, of the purchase
money, paid annually for 36} years, will blow the
loan right out of existence. Compound interest is a
powerful explosive. The whole thing 'means that, by
using the borrowing power of the State, money can
be passed on to the settler at from 5} to 6 p.c.,
which payment not only provides interest, but wipes
the debt out in 36} years. Present writer isn’t more
than middle-aged; yet the first mortgage transac-
tion of which he had any personal knowledge re-
volved around the raising of a small amount on a
desirable farm, and the Private Enterprise brigands
of that day demanded and got no less than 8 p.c.
f r interest alone. And all the while those brigands
yelled at the top of their unctuous voices that the
man on the land was the only person worth con-
sidering, and when a few years later the Laborites
arrived, and the John Ballances, those same brigands
warned their agricultural friend to beware of the
new devils. That tribe of brigand isn’t dead yet
and some of them are still in politics.

This branch of what is officially the State Guaranteed
Advances Office is authorised to borrow £760,000 a
year and lend it out, “for the purpose of purchasing
or erecting a dwelling, to any person employed in
manual or clerical work who is not in receipt of an
income of more than £2OO per annum, and is not
the owner of any land other than the allotment on
which it is proposed to build.” The maximum loan
is £450, and up to three-fourths of the value of the
security may be advanced. Interest, as in the case
of advances to settlers, is 44 p.c. (prompt payment),
and the loans are for anything up to 36} years. A
1 p.c. payment annually for 36} years makes the
property free. The Department has plans of about
20 types of houses, and borrowers can get copies of
these free, with specifications, etc. Some of these
dwellings run into a bit more than the £450 which
can be borrowed ; but the man who goes to the bank
and is prepared to settle down to a long fight to
make his home his own usually has a few pounds in
the missus’s stocking. The missus’s stocking some-
how seems to leak least. Altogether, though the
office got really to work only five years ago, 6843
people have received assistance to make homes for
themselves, and about 25 more are being helped
weekly ; and one shouldn’t want more proof that the
office was wanted. As a matter of fact, the office
offers a trifle too many advantages. From the fore-
going table it will be seen that there is now over
£2,000,000 of borrowed money out on loans, and
all that the Department has to cover the risk of bad
debts and other contingencies is a wretched little
£12,542. It isn’t enough; the margin of profit is
too small to provide reserves quickly, and they
may be wanted quickly, because it’s in
the early stages, when few instalments have been
paid off, that securities are liable to be thrown on
to the mortgagee’s hands with the most disastrous
results. A quarter p.c. more would bring in a badly-
wanted £5014 a year at present—if the extra
charge could be made all round, and of course it
can’t be. Which is all the more reason why it
should be charged where it can be.

S. Aus. makes a complete separation of its Savings
Bank and its State Bank: the only connection be-
tween them is that the former holds some, but not
many, of the latter’s mortgage bonds. As with the
other State savings banks, the arrival of the Com-
monwealth Bank spurred it to a more strenuous pur-
suit of the people’s pennies, and interest (at 3} p.c.)
has been allowed during the year on deposits of
anything up to £lOO in excess of the old limit of
£250. But, since the S. Australian outlook for most
of this year has been poor, there has been no great
growth in the money at depositors’ credit. Figures
for a few years past:—
1906 .. £4,750,192 1910 .. £6,771,150
1907 .. 5,304,704 1911 .. ~m ,i U

1909 . . 6,328,870 1913 . . 8,608,478
The greater part of the funds, as in the case of
every other State Savings Bank, is in local Govern-
ment stock; but the proportion in this case is
smaller than with most, amounting to only 56 p.c.,
including a Treasury deposit. On the other hand,
the trustees do well in lending out 24 p.c. of their
total assets on mortgage, mostly to assist small men.
For many years down to 1901 as little as 4 p.c. was
charged on these loans; for the past year it became
necessary to charge from 4} to 5} p.c. Considering
that the bank has no separate Advances Department,
but sensibly conducts the whole business as one,
just like any other well-managed concern would do,
the expenses are low. They amounted last year to
7s. Bd. per cent, of total assets. Per ■ transaction
(deposit or repayment) this was equal to 7}d. The
Victorian rate is about }d. lower; but in that case
there is the expense of the Credit Foncier (Advances
Department) to be added. In the matter of economy
the S. Australian bank takes a front place, if not the
very front place, among Australian State sav-
ings banks; and it has also more than economy to
recommend it. Thus the profit put by is reasonably
large, and the reserves are very solid compared with
the visible risks.

The co. is just going to have its 25th annual meet-
ing; and its 26th should be held in the very fine new
premises that it is putting up for its own and other
people's use in O’Connell-street. Perhaps it could
have done without the money ; nevertheless the new
property (it had cost £25,314 up to the end of
September) was a good enough reason for getting in
another £20,000 of capital. As 10 p.c. investments
are not got every day, there wasn’t any riot. And
the 10 p.c. looks all the better in this case because
the money is going into property in one of the picked
sites of the city—near enough to the busiest business
streets to be for all practical purposes in them ; yet
just far enough out of them to be free from ithe
racket of the tram and other traffic. Apart from the
investment of £25,314 in the O’Connell-street pro-
perty, the co. has £20,000 in a Treasury deposit,
£43,724 on mortgage and £3774 in cash and
sundries; and it owed on one account and another no
less than 3s. Whether any special effort is to be
made to shift this liability the directors don’t say.
Capital paid is now £50,000 in 200,000 ss. shares.
Including reserves, funds are equal to Bs. 9d. per
share; and, assuming that the mortgages are all
right, all of that Bs. 9d. is intact. On top of that
is the business, which, though of course it doesn’t
appear in the accounts as an asset, is worth money.
For at the worst, supposing the co. didn’t get any
more to administer, it has estates in hand worth
£3,254,448; and there’s a penny or two to be got
from them yet, especially in view of this co.’s prac-
tice of not making its charge for corpus commis-
sion till the estate becomes distributable. Take an
estate worth £25,000, to be divided among children
on the death of the mother and on the youngest
infant coming of age. For administering this estate
the co. charges (in ordinary circumstances) 2} p.c.
on the income. Say the estate brines i n ? „„
£1250. The co. s annual charge would thus' k
£3l ss. On the completion of the Swfe
be 20 years—the co. takes 2} p.c. on the gross c aDi
tal value; that is, £625. The total cost- A.
estate would thus be £1250, spread over jn
payment for 20 years’ services in handling nrinninJ!
and interest totalling £50,000. That is to say the
beneficiaries pay the co. in all 2} p.c. of the L!
they receive; and as half this commission is paid
only when the work is done, the estate getsfte
benefit of the interest earnings on that amount
throughout the 20 years. Calculated on their Tani
tal, the earnings of trustee cos. no doubt look very
luscious, as a rule; yet these cos. do far more for
their money than most people who live on commit
sions, and unquestionably they do it better. More'
over, they do a work which simply has to be done
You needn’t buy a house or a cow or a sham
Thousands of men of means never bought anv one
of these things. But, sooner or later, every man of
means must need an executor—and when he will
need him he won’t be able to watch him Oon
sequently there never was a job which it was more
necessary to put very deliberately into safe hands-
and the safe hands belong to those who, by trainin'?’
know how to do the work ; who have put up a monev
guarantee that they will do it honestly; and who
are interested in giving satisfaction because they live
by this business. It is, therefore, almost impossible
to conceive of anything that can stop the progress
of the professional trustee, and it is the most natural
thing in the world that this co., in spite of having a
sort of big elder brother, should have added just-
upon 50 p.c. to the value of the estates under
administration during the past 10 years.

The Glasses saw that there was going to be a rapid
development in the rubber business, and they formed
this as from June 1, 1908, to take advantage if
)t. Originally 45,000 £1 shares were provided for
but only 25,000 were at once issued, half of them
8 p.c. cumulative prefs., the other half ordinaries;
one lot paid for in money, the other lot with the
assets of the old firm. It wasn’t, however, enough;
at the end of the first year (or, rather, 13 months)’
the co. had liabilities almost equal to the paid capi-
tal. Another 5000 prefs. and the same number of
ordinaries were sold during the next year; and still
the business grew and called for more. By the end
of 1911 there were two lots of 8 p.c. cumulative
pref. shares—22,soo “A”s and 15,000 “B”s—be-
sides 22,500 ordinaries; total capital, £60,000. Yet
the concern had moved along so fast that the liabili-
ties were still over £30,000. Since then the un-
issued “B” pref. shares have been sent to market,
and the paid capital is now £75,000. This shows
the various movements:—

Of the present liabilities £15,673 is secured by
mortgage on the co.’s freeholds, and £27,549 con-
sists of bills payable, a few deposits and other trade
debts. Assuming that the stock is normal,‘it seems
pretty clear that the co. could do with more share
capital yet. For, of course, the rubber business
isn’t going to stand still ; mechanical traction is
growing every day, and the demand for rubber grows
with it. Incidentally, the means to supply it has
created a firm demand for a hundred rubber side-
lines. No doubt some day somebody may produce a
cheap substitute; but the tremendously increased
production of rubber has probably turned most of
the experimenters off a track which, so far as can
be learned, had given few if any promising results.
As mentioned above, none of the capital is repre-
sented by goodwill or other hypothetical assets. One
can’t, of course, swear to the stock; it looks as
though it might be liable to severe fluctuations—
with the tendency downwards. But; assuming that
there is no over-valuation there or in the book-debts,
the balance-sheet is conspicuously “clean.” This
absence of “water” explains a good deal of the fine
profit and the superfine dividend—the latter, by the
way, all the finer because the co. pays the income
tax. Comparatively speaking, the pref. capital is
certainly large, and the value of a preference is gov-
erned chiefly by its size in proportion to the ordin-
ary capital ; still the 8 p.c. on the two lots of prefs.
calls for only £4200, and there is a very wide mar-
gin between that and the actual net profits of the
nast two years. Prior to that the profits were twice
less than £4200 ; but the business hadn't been de-
veloped then as it is to-day, and didn’t have half as
much capital in it. Ordinaries carry considerably
greater risks. The prefs., which come in ahead of
them, represent more than two-thirds of the capital,
and the 8 p.c. cumulative is a very substantial first
bite out of profits. As against that, the more the
pref. capital and the fewer the ordinary shares, the
Letter for the latter when things go well and the
capital all round is earning more than the fixed
pref. dividend. This makes ordinaries attractive to
a man who wants a big return and reckons he is
young enough to take some risks with his capital in
order to get it.

Nothing has been clipped off this co.’s mortgage
during the year, so the bulky plaster remains at
38.500. Still, that is better than it used to be.
When the co. decided that its earthly possessions
weren’t worth as much as the books alleged, the load
was £68,000 That was in 1897. The co. has,
therefore, made pretty good progress. One thing,
however, is in shareholders’ favor —the pub is free-
hold, consequently there is no landlord to ask them
to quit in a few years without the option, or to stay
on under very stiff conditions. The capital to start
with was £122,752, or equal to 19s. a share; subse-
quently, when the smash of the early ’9o’s came, 17s.
a share was written off. Then a call of I4d. a
share was made, which resulted in a big bunch of
scrip being forfeited, so that the capital now stands
at £13,492, on which the present dividend is calcu-
lated. On the original capital it is under 3 p.c.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re--
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round 1
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

the use of one of these Sizers the saving in time
would, in a very short while, cover the small initial
cost of the machine. The machine can be dressed
with any series of screens. The Austral Otis Eng.

Thus though it has done whatever renewals and re-
pairs seemed necessary, and doled out its dividend
the co. is £21,231 better off than it was 10 years
ago, and the progress should become more rapid as
the interest bill decreases. The revenue from the
business is still very satisfactory: £26,682 for the

which there is a small income from rents etc. The

round, and times Won’t always be verv good Rut

and under the present law will go on decreasing for
a good many years to come, to the great benefit of
those that are left.

This is the old Federal Building, Land and Invest-
ment Society’s second time on earth ; and if it had
been content for the past year to pay 6 p.c. instead
of again bumping up the dividend, this paper would
be better pleased at the resurrection. Its capital is
oniy £28,694, including a trifle paid in advance of
possible calls; and the liabilities (mostly deposits)
amount to £104,279. There are cash, deposits and
other liquid assets totalling £36,748 ; the rest of the
money—£lo2,B4s—is out in advances (£87,323)
and properties. A co. with £87,323 in advances
ought to have more than £4507 of reserves if it
values its shareholders’ peace of mind. The assets
may be quite good and great care may have been
exercised in making advances ; but the people who are
running this office ought to know by this time what
uncertain cattle Queensland property values are.

"Plain English”: “P.X.’s” Jesuitical “ex-
planation” of the new welshing regulation of the Syd-
ney Stock Exchange (B. 16/10/T3) conceals facts with
words. This “regulation,” which is so irregular as
to be illegal, and would be a device unflattering even
to a pony racecourse, was passed hurriedly to pro-
tect certain bears of Oxide Creeks from the penalty
of their own foolishness. Some men who were caught
“short” paid up and have made no use of the regula-
tion ; others have caused it to be made practically
retrospective, which the Stock Exchange expressly
voted against; and they attempt to explain away the
“heads ! -win-tails-you-lose” trick by saying that it was
intended to baulk a conspiracy. These are the facts.
Oxide Creeks started without friends, and a big
parcel of the shares was applied for by men whom
certain bears considered could not pay the calls on
the shares when due. It was only a 2s. stock, and
when came the news of rich ore and good widths of
it persisting at 200 ft., the men who owned the Oxide
Creek started in to support their own stock ; and
bears oversold these 2s. shares at 2s. 6d. before it had
been a week in existence. Then the Oxide Creek
men found they had bought a stock that had no ex-
istence, and they demanded delivery, and the ordinary
bears paid. The others howled, and the Stock Ex-
change passed this regulation to suspend buying-in
orders indefinitely. That amounts to cancellation.
The aggrieved party has his common-law right, but
it is of little use. If a man sues for the stock he
bought, the case comes on two or three months after
the event, and it is concluded by the handing over of
the scrip. To anything else the Court says, “Do the
impossible, and prove special damage.” A book-
maker may say with equal justice, “You had 100 to
10 Uncle Sam, and Uncle Sam won. I won’t pay
you this time, but I’ll carry the bet on to his next
race next month or next year.” Sydney Stock Ex-
change is making itself ridiculous ail over Australia.
The next thing we’ll hear of will be the welshing
bookmaker suspending payment because backers were
in a conspiracy to make a strongly-supported horse
win.
The Broken Hill South Extended is hav-
ing another reconstruction. A quarter of a century
ago the Broken Hill Consols Co. was floated in Eng-
land, and when J. Bull wouldn’t stand any more
reconstructions to keep that alleged mine going,
another “mine” was discovered, and the name of the
co. was changed. But the leopard wouldn't be able
to change his spots any the more easily if you called
him the Horse Extended or the Camel Underlay, and
it’s the same with the B. H. South Extended. Pros-
pects are certainly a little better since the Zinc
Corporation made a do of things at the old South
Blocks; but an “investor’s” chances are still better
at most two-up parlors.
Golden Springs Co. has got the old
Brown’s Creek (N.S.W.) drv, and has a big body of
9dwt. ore at the 200 ft. level. Not one sample over
35ft. of crosscut was a duffer. For over 20 years
30 stamps were in action, and for a great part of
that time 40 heads. Fully a million tons were
treated for a recovery of sdwt. or 6dwt., with 11s. in
the tails. Not a ton of ore has been mined below
150 ft., and but for stupid management, the old
French co. would probably have been mining now.
It had the Bdwt. ore body at the 200 ft., and from
the 250 ft. a rise went up in Bdwt. ore all the way.
Apparently this is not the ore body mined in the
open cut, but the dolomite lode which at the 250 ft
is worth, according to old reports, 3 p.c. copper and
7dwt. gold, and this lode is virgin to the surface,
where it outcrops. The French co. ran on ore and
mullock from the open cuts for 4dwt. and then shut
down, and the mine has been under water ever since.
A few years ago Whear Roberts milled 6319 tons,
from open-cut work at a total cost of 7s. 4d. a ton,
and in 1905 he milled 10,933 tons for 6s. sd. a ton
(all costs) for a recovery of £12,000 worth of gold ,
but land slides ate the profit and the cuts were
abandoned. The mine has all necessary equipment,
and is preparing to crush from the free milling ore
at the 200 ft.
Southern Cross, Ardlethan, settled itself
with three shafts long ago ; but it has made a raft
of its ancient scrap-iron mill, and refuses to sink till
the mill is completed. Then the whole lot will go
down because there’ll be no water to float in. This
mixture of metaphor is in imitation of the Southern
Gross s last report. No. 2 shaft: “Two walls con-
tinue down ; now passing through clay floors dipping
from north to south.” The “two walls” in the clay
floors are excellent half-brothers of the lode 14ft.
wide, outcropping at the bottom of a shaft 4ft. wide
and Lsft. deep, on which the co. was so impudently
floated.

Great Boulder (W.A.) is getting a move
on with the sampling of the Big Bell option, 18
miles nor’-west of Cue. Besides two quartz reefs
there is a big schist formation, which according to
the vendors’ bulk sampling is worth nearly £6 per
ton, exclusive of gold in residues. Some assay test-
ing is now being done to determine whether there is
likely to be much of this grade or any other passable
grade in the show.
Lancefield Co. (W.A.) will not reappear
from me ouiiviou into wu,eii it s u/v>.u ae. ,e
ago. All idea of trying to raise further capital has
been abandoned, and the bailiff for one of the prin-
cipal creditors is in charge, pending liquidation. The
co. owes to the bank and others £40,000 ; and,
while shareholders might have been persuaded to
find cash for plant reorganisation, they could not be
induced to face the crushing liability mentioned
above. With new plant and producer gas power the
mine might be made to pay, and some knowing ones
will probably do what was done in the case of other
ruined London-Westralian concerns —namely, buy in
the co.’s assets at one-tenth their value and start
where it has wearily left off. Some time ago 218,245
tons of 345. 6d. ore were alleged to be in reserve,
and if these figures are any way near right those
getting hold of the mine will have a fair amount of
developed stuff to operate on.
Marvel Loch (W.A.) has let its old mine
on tribute, and its present operations are confined to
the neighboring Comet lease. The Bulletin re-
marked some time ago that this show was a sus-
picious character, and, judging by the present price
of Loch shares, the market is beginning to take that
view also.
The latest set of managerial figures shows
that of the £2,057,993 said to be visible in the
Ivanhoe (W.A.), more than two-thirds is in the East
lode. The remainder is mostly in the Middle lode,
and what isn’t in that body is in the New and
Boulder-boundary lodes. As scarcely anything worth
blowing about has been found in the East lode in
the last four or five levels, and as geologist Maclaren
does not hold out any hope of the co. getting anything
for several hundred feet more in depth, the mine
appears to be in for rather a lean time.
To September 30, Westralia’s State bat-
teries treated 939,365 tons of gold ore for a return
of £4,039,892. This wealth does not include revenue
derived from residues dealt with since July. The
tin ore handled was 62,988 tons, from which 831
tons of concentrates, valued at £75,000, were ob-
tained. In 1912 the quantity of gold-ore crushed
barely represented six weeks’ work per mill per year,
but this year’s figures are shaping better.
A special sampling of Yuanmi (W.A.) is
officially stated to have revealed 47,903 tons of sul-
phide reserves above No. 5 level; the assay value is
estimated at 41/-. Mention is also made of 13,514
tons of 235. to 28s. ore, but the latter is not taken
into account “until further investigation has demon-
strated that it will average above the pavable mar-
gin.” Oxidised reserves are given as 23,488 tons of
345. ore, and the “energetic development policy” now
being pursued in the upDer levels is expected to
gradually add to this nest-egg. In addition Oroya
Black Range—the co.’s other show —has a little lot
computed at 45,777 tons, assaying, 335. 6d. per ton.
Monthly profits from the two properties now average
about £4500, and this surplus is to be maintained
until further notice. •
As this paper feared, the volatilisation
process hasn’t answered on Gwalia Consolidated ore.
Breaking the news to shareholders, at an extra-
ordinary meeting held in London, the chairman said
that, on going into the position, the Board had
come to the conclusion that it was no use struggling
on anv longer. Algernon Moreing then stepped forward
and read the burial service. He said large sums had
been spent in trying to elucidate the treatment of
the antimonial-arsenical ore with which the property
is cursed, but everv process tried was too expensive
for the amount of gold recovered. Metallurgical
science might some day do something different, but
for the present any money put up with the ohipct of
making more would, he thought, simply lead to
further disappointment and loss.^
The sort of stuff Ballarat mines are de-

There isn’t much to come and go on when stone
vields like this; nevertheless one or two divs. have
shown up in the last three months from the Llanberris
mines. For all that, when the Scotch people who put
up the stuff for the Central Plat.’s shaft see what
sort of stone is being mined and milled, their lan-
guage will help to feed the flames in Sheol.

The year started well, but only the recovery in
the Pyke mines has kept averages up of late. None of
the deep mines now flatter their supporters. Even
Catherine Reef, with its big formation, working at
the half-way stage of 2300 ft., finds a lot of stone
there under the pay limit. Nearly all the old mines
have gone groping about in the shallow ground, but
they find very few pickings to help them off the call
list.
•* * * *
Niemann, inventor of the process for
treating selenite ores, has been trying his hand on
the auriferous pyrites of Bendigo. The first go was
with “mineral’’ from the Catherine Reef, and
success was reported. But it takes more than
the “mineral” from any one mine to keep
a plant in full swing, so pyrites are being gathered
from several claims to serve as a bulk sample. The
happy family of “mineral” buyers in Victoria don’t
want a cheap process to bring down charges, but
mining cos. won’t complain even if relief in this
matter does come to them “made in Germany.”
* * *
Boring done near Morwell (Vic.) has
just proved a thickness of 400 ft. of brown coal.
This is State work; and as, in the days of Reggie
Murray, another bore at Morwell went through 750 ft.
of the same material, there isn’t a doubt that the
cabbage garden can put up a world’s record so far as
big seams of brown coal go. What Willie Watt
didn’t disclose in his budget was what had
become of the Anglo-German syndicate which reached
out a fat hand to grasp a slab of the Morwell de-
posits, planning also to get the rights to convey
current within the State railway fences. “Geology”
Herman is doing good work to get the extent of the
brown coal proved, and the statesman’s job is to turn
the fuel to account by yarding in the by-products
from such magnificent deposits as lie undeveloped in
Victoria. Private Enterprise wouldn’t mind cutting
in if it had the right to turn the coal into electric
energy and open up business in Melbourne; but
that is blocked because the Railway Department,
when it completes the electrification of the suburban
railways, may want to vend power to the
people. Still, there must be a heap of money in
these deposits some day; for with the world using
up more and more oil and petrol, the scope for dis-
tillation works in connection with the huge seams
of brown coal is tremendous.
According to the local newspaper, which
usually holds the mirror up to facts, the face of the
south drive in the Homeward Bound at Yackandan-
dah (Vic.) shows 4ft. 6in. of 27dwt. stone. Home-
ward Bound was the leading reef in north-east Vic-
toria in the ’6o’s, crushed 45,000 tons for an aver-
age of lljdwt., and caved in for want of timbering.
Yackandandah is in the rich alluvial area, over
1,000,0000 z. having come from the surface opera-
tions. For a number of years 1500 miners paid for
their drinks with gold dust, and two of them dug
out a bucket of gold each in a day. Then came
John A. Wallace with his sluicing operations, fol-
lowed by the Briseis dredges, one of which toppedgjhe
gold-recovery record in Victoria last year. It was
working at the mouth of Kinchington Creek, whir l '
drains the Homeward Bound hill. Homeward Bound
stone yields in sand and concentrates about 10dwt.,
which the old miners sent down the creek. The reef
is now cut at 700 ft. depth by a tunnel 2000 ft. long,
and has about 300 ft. of backs. The co. (40,000
shares) has another string to its bow in the Bon
Accord reef, a parallel formation 500 ft. west, which
crushed well over the ounce. The westerly level of
the tunnel is within 100 ft. of this reef. The Bon
Accord shoot, however, appears to have been short
—about 50ft. —but may lengthen at depth.
The Commission sitting at Charters
Towers to inquire re the proposed deep vertical shaft
has drawn forth much evidence about the almost pro-
hibitive cost of sinking shafts on the underlay below
2500 ft. The cost of No. 2 underlay shaft at Mills
United for 150 ft. was £2l 4s. lOd. per foot. At
the Deeps, under far easier conditions, it was about
£9. According to the manager of the Deeps, there
is plenty of stone in the mine that would pay to
handle if ventilation was improved and costs were
moderate. At the best, though, it will take probably
from three to four years to sink a big circular shaft
to 3000 ft. and connect with the Deeps’ workings;
and as the bottom level (No. 6) has given sufficient
encouragement to go on with the sinking, the man-
agement is preparing to send the underlay down
another lift. It’s the right thing; for even if the
larger scheme of sinking a big circular shaft
matures, the Brilliant Deeps must do development
work.
Charters Towers’ calls for nine months,
£27,997 ; dividends, only £16,683. The production
during the period was valued at £233,989. The most
hopeful show just now is the New Brilliant Freehold,
which is opening up No. 6 level from the hanging-
wall crosscut. Winzing from No. 5 has proved a
reef 3ft. thick, but nothing can be said about average
values till larger crushings are sent to the mill. There
are 150,000 shares; market value, Bs. Brilliant
Deeps continue out of favor, because most of the
shareholders are poor men and ill-prepared to hold
on so long without a dividend. The ore shoot this
co. has been working hasn’t been proved payable for
more than 300 ft. in length, and there have been
several blanks within that distance; and the profit
from one level is mopped up in the costly develop-
ment of the ground below There are hundreds of
“rich” mines that keep their shareholders poor in
this way. » * *
The Hydro-Electric Co. (Tas.) has struck
trouble, and is unable to raise the money to com-
plete its scheme. The stringency of the London
money-market is blamed, but there are other reasons.
The £336.000 of vendors’ and watered stock, and the
doubt whether the co. could comply with its Act
regarding the erection of metallurgical works and
treatment of ores, have had something to do with
the failure. The co. approached the Government for
assistance, but, to the surprise of nearly everyone,
the Tasmanian Legislature, almost for the first
on record, refused to do anything but buy out the
co. The Assembly, owing, of course, to the fact
that Labor dominates the position, has passed the
Purchase Bill, and if the Council agrees, the Gov-
ernment will complete the scheme. The co. will
then receive 17s. 6d. in the £ on all money actually
expended, with the condition that the money must
be put into metallurgical works within the
State. These works will probably be for the
manufacture of carbide, although the original pro-
moters got their Bill through the House mainly on
the strength of a nrocess for zinc-extraction. How-
ever it will do Tasmania some good to have car-
bide’works, and if Mr. Gillies can, as he still affirms,
work his zinc process, so much the better. The co.
undertakes to pay for 3500 h.p. at 5 p.c. above actual
cost, so the State starts off with a good customer.
The whole business will cost about £320.000, and
should provide one of the best and cheapest power-
schemes in the world. Had the State taken on the
venture at the outset instead of giving the rights to
a co. it is probable that a saving of £30,000 or
£40,000 could have been effected. #
“S A S ” ’ Maoriland’s wonderful Waihi is
far from dead yet, and the lodes are giving better
values at depth than was expected. Shares which
were 30s. three months ago are now 565. 1 he co
has an area of over 700 acres, and only snout 30
acres have been thoroughly prospected. There is
room vet for the mine to develop lug ore reserves.
Tbe co ’s electric power scheme is almost completed ;
this will make a P big difference to costs. J. W.
Walker, better known as “Long Drive” Walker, is'
now in London with a scheme to develop 2000 acres-
on the line of reef. He is the pioneer of the dis-
trict, and, although 85 years of age, is still full of
go. He was one of the couple who floated the Waihii
and Waihi Grand Junction in London 20 1 years ago.
The Australian Oil Wells Co. (Melb.) is-
offering a last lot of 20,000 Is. shares with the object
of continuing to promote its hunt for petroleum in-
likely Australian areas; and there are several tfoak

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 20, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
Rose Day lias dragged about £3OOO from
our innumerable citizens. This sum will
be split up amongst 50 charities which suffer
from a chronic shortage of cash unrelieved
by the annual raid that is made on Hos-
pital Saturday. Martin Place buzzed with
excitement as the centre of theatrical
operations on the public purse. W. S.
Percy clamored for every brass farthing the
passer-by had saved up for a rainy day.
Florence Young pounced on the unwary
across the street. Little Dorothy Brunton
laid in wait for dog fanciers, with the lemon
and white bulldog "Barry” as gentleman
help in waiting. Secretary Upjohn’s sug-
gestion that artificial blooms should be used
next year has a solid base of horse-sense.
Flower-lovers hated to see glorious roses
dying in thousands in gaily decorated stands
or morgues. An impetus to artificial flower-
making in Sydney would be given by an
order for say, 30,000 roses. Instead of buy-
ing the tomb of a dead bud, the thrifty
woman who was thinking of her spring hat
could purchase the fixings of her October
millinery and give to 56 indigent charities
at the same time.
A Sufferer who thinks Fly-Paper Day
should exterminate Rose Day remarks that
the lady traders at the Sports Ground didn’t
play the game. “I gave,” says he, “three
half-sovereigns to three .rose-sellers in Mar-
tin Place. I didn’t mind that” (he didn’t
mind it much, anyhow) “as I had deter-
mined to give a pound, and had (by bad
luck) an extra half-sov., which was
wheedled out of me in a fair commercial
spirit. Having parted with my 30 bob, I
believed myself immune or vaccinated
against further attacks of rosepox. A
small label, ‘United Charities,’ was pinned
on my coat where all might see that I was
so inoculated with benevolence that no
one should attempt to catch another penny
from me. In this happy state of mind, and
glowing with benevolence (I could see that
30 bob being put to my credit by the Re-
cording Angel) I went forth unarmed and
unprotected to the carnival on the Agricul-
tural Ground. There I was persistently
attacked by women of all sizes and every
degree of persistence. They fell upon me,
and like the daughters of the Horse Leech,
cried ‘More —give more.’ I pointed to my
rosepox ticket and said I was immune. ‘That
makes no difference,’ said the Pretty Dears,
‘dust one more shilling!’ I regret to repeat
myself, but I consider they did not play
the game!”
The Strickland ladyship drove on to the
Agricultural Ground to see the medley of
sports in aid of Rose Day’s cash-box. The
chariot race was the star turn of the after-
noon. This kicked up enough dust and ex-
citement to give the spectators all the Ben-
jamin Ilur revival they wanted. Daring
horse-experts from the Army Service Corps
drove a chariot apiece. The gee-gees bolted
after a preliminary trial of speed, and noble
Romans who were part of the spectacular
effect had to wait about in breathless expec-
tation of picking up the matchwood splinters
of the frail stage vehicles. The pole in
one of these toys snapped away from the
trappings. An exhibition of magnificent
horsemanship on the part of driver Haywood
gave the public ten shillings’ worth of Aus-
tralian sport—not Roman. The other
chariots bolted past the stand like lightning
pursued by mad wolves. By some kind of
minor miracle none of the Benjamins were
smashed up, and the laurel bandage went
to driver Hur Gilchrist.
During the glare of illuminated Sydney to
welcome our baby Fleet, Queen Victoria’s
bronze effigy was one of the most dressy
events of the week. Soon as the evening
shades prevailed (with apologies to Addi-
son ), the bulbs took up the colored tale. The
old lady looked very fine in her party crino-
line of electric lights, but Albert had to be
Good in the dark. Never a candle-end lit the
bronze boots of the late Prince Consort, who
stands with his back to Hyde Park and gets
a good deal of weather on his royal nose.
Fierce loyalists who noted the omission pro-
bably felt that it was all Albert’s fault. As
a foreign person with insufficient means of
support who dared to marry the Queen of
England, the estimable German gentleman
has been one of the most consistently snubbed
personages (alive and dead) in modern his-
tory—barring, perhaps, that Servian royal
pair whose remains were thrown out of the
window.
Governor Strickland has pledged his sub-
regal word to open the Women’s Handi-
crafts’ Exhibition in St. James’s Hall before
this reaches you. The show will be visible
all the week.
High Commissioner Reid happily forgot to
die in the Red Sea, and so broke faith with
some Sapphira who sent her Ananias a wire-
less rumor to that effect. By the time this
alleged news had travelled round the city
every detail of the burial was discussed by
“they say.” Isn’t a lie a marvellous flying-
machine when it gets a good shove off? By
way of revoking his death in a thoroughly
satisfactory manner, our Pie Commissionef
is booked for a local banquet or two, and a
midday snack with the Millions Club in Syd-
ney.
SkippeT Brooke Smith, of the Omrah, and
his gold-striped mates gave a hop.on board)
before departing hence, Smith, R.N.R., is
one of the Orient Co.’s smart yohng meh who
have swiftly climbed to ekipperdom.. Ih &
rapidly-gtowing company promotion is swift,
while in a stagnant of declining cphcefn
even a third mate may be driven to disguise
his age with hair-dve before he has a chance
to rise to the position of second. Skipper
Smith has already made a name as a mariner
who means to put down haw-haw-dom as ex-
cess luggage, not wanted on the voyage by
officers in the mercantile marine.
Skipper Trask, the fatherly mariner who
trains the Sonoma in the way it should go
in a head wind, gave a lunch on board that
steamer on October 17. General-Manager
Sproul also helped to welcome the company,
As a pick-me-up after too much Turkey-
trot in race week, a few of our less flighty
Society folks made a solemn pilgrimage to
the Geology School, where Prof. David filled
them up with South Pole strata (in tabloid
form), illustrated by snapshots of Mrs, Em-
peror Penguins At Home on the first ThUfs-
dav and fourteenth Monday.
Mrs. Mayoress Cocks held a cheque for
£lOO3 odd shillings in her right glove the
other afternoon. This record total for a
St. Vincent's Hospital Ball was then handed
by our municipal mamma to the Mother
Rectress of that healing institution.
Conflicting accounts of the amount of
Turkey-trot and Bunny-hug that leapt
through the Matrons’ and the Queen’s Club
Balls are oozing out of startled dames who
were present at both those Society hops. At
one of these revels —each side furiously re-
pudiates ownership of the revel- —the Bunny-
hugs of our Best People reached a stage that
incited some of the matrons present to
threaten to stop the music if the dancing
didn’t tame down. X-ray skirts as thick as
draped moonshine floated over silk tights on
the Really Rapid anatomy. A vision in flesh
pink Turkey-trotting round one smart ball-
room is now torn, by proxy, limb from limb,
in the strongholds of Mrs. Grundy. That
good lady is getting so many shocks of late
that she is likely to drop dead if somebody
doesn’t hand her a chair in a quiet back
street for an hour or two.
That ancient time-piece, the still
survives the age of monoplanes and X-ray
skirts. A few hardy veterans shadow the
toiling sun outside some of Sydney’s middle-
aged mansions. At Lindsay, Darling Point,
in the soon-to-be-destroyed garden which is to
be sold as allotments, stands a venerable
dial. The place has been more recently
occupied by the Macintosh family, but in the
days that the locust had for dinner, Lindsay
sheltered Thomas Mitchell and his family,
before Carthona was built on the water-
lapped edge of Darling Point. At the sale
of furniture in the former house the other
day, a fine sideboard bore the scribbled line
in pencil—still legible, “Charles Nicholson,
1820.” This early pillar of the State is
alleged to have been one of the Mitchell girl’s
oldest admirers. But when he heard that
that lively lady alluded to him as y “Old
Nick,” he gave up his suit in a Luff, Whether
the sideboard was a love-token, deponent
knoweth not. The sun-dial, however, was
placed in the garden at Lindsay by that
Barker who married one of Thomas Mitchell’s
daughters. A carved bedstead, brought to
this port when it was known as Sydney
Cove, gave the bidding a fillip at the recent
sale. For those who dote on antiquity, a
centenarian bed, or an old, worm-eaten chair
is almost as good as a brand-new legacy.
Sydney Uni. undergrads gave a tea-and-
tennis tournament in the ’Varsity Quad-
rangle the other afternoon. The tea was
swallowed in the Great Stone sarcophagus
or hall, which is filled with the portraiture
of bygone chancellors and other muffled
tomes of learning. The mixed doubles’ vic-
tors on the green were undergrads Jean Mac-
donald and her partner, J. R. Bariskill, who
played a brilliant game. Some of their play
was a bit over the odds, by the same token.
Miss Macdonald gave one ball such a
Homeric smite that it took a flying leap into
the headgear of one of our Best People. The
Best Person was speechless with indignation
for quite five minutes after this crisis in
the tourney. Lmdergrads Mollie Lloyd,
Perry, Gregg. C. Tozer and Newberry lent a
hand in the fray.
Architect A. C. Lavington, of Kandy, and
his wife, stepped off the Moldavia when she
sidled up to Circular Quay. Mrs. Laving-
ton is a Maorilander, and she is recuperating
from Ceylon’s spicy breezes, and resting
from the burden of the island nigger. _ _
Accountant W. T. Morris and his wife de-
parted in the Marmora for Ceylon. They’re
going to holiday in that sunburnt isle.
Eva Gauthier, the little French-Canadian
warbler,- sends a line from Samarang. Be-
yond remarking that the heat is terrible and
that she wishes herself back in Sydney, Eva
forwards no comment on the local mosquito,
python, vampire bat, crocodile, octopus,
grass-climbing gorilla, flying dog, egg-planc
or sea-serpent.
A. Q. Rowdandson, the tetrarch of the
NiSiW. Bookstall Co., arrived home by the
Otway the other morning; also the Springs
(he is managing-director of the Metters
firm) came by the same boat. These latter
went by the Siberian route, and praise it
highly.
Cohcerhing the small girl Robertson who
is the bone of contention in the House of
Lords, did yoh notice the horrible fate sug-
gested by Auntie IlawkeFs counselV He
Said that Ahntie NoyeS wanted to bring the
child tip as an AuslrulitiH instead of an Eng-
lishwoman, In this continent her prospects
would be bright, fot Auntie Noyes is rich
and can provide for hef niece. Better, how-
ever, to struggle for a crust with, her Eng-
lish relative, who is not wildly gifted with
this world’s goods, than live in affluence
with Mrs, Noyes as a mere Australian. Lord
LorebUrn took the quaint view—for a mem-
ber of the HoUse Of lordly fossils —that it
Would be quite ds good to .be brought Up
Austtaliah as English. So the affluent Aus-
tralian aunt got the .child, and she will have
to put Up with nice frocks and pocket-
money and a good education and a generofis
marriage portion to make up for the loss of
her English domicile.
Parson-cricketer E. F, Waddy and team
are booked to depart for Colombo in the
Macedonia on December 13. Mrs. E. F., and
a cousin, Miss Waddy, also a parental
Waddy, are included in the bat and ball fol-
lowing. Young Major, a North Sydney
Grammar School boy, who goes with the
Waddy party, is nephew of a theatrical
man who is the J. C. Williamson of Ceylon,
You can’t J.C.W. very much in a place with
such a mere handful of white population, but
the uncle does his best to be a howling gale
in a teacup.
In spite of the uproar in Colombo over the
Aserappa affair, the committee of welcome
to the Waddy cricketers is arranging to give
White Australians a good time. This com-
mittee consists of burghers, who are mostly
Eurasians, with a Dutch or Portuguese
flavor. A Ceylon paper recently reported
the mouthpiece of this organisation to this
effect: “Private feelings must be stifled, as
the N.S.W. team had been invited before the
Aserappa trouble. All that remains to us,”
said the mouthpiece through his hurt feel-
ings, “is to give the Australians a good
time, and show them what the Ceylonese
are worth.” The deep brown or burnt-umber
party, however, is expected to make an effort
to unofficially give the visitors a moderately
bad time.
Elizabeth (Perceval Allen) in the Paris
version of “Tannhauser,” as played by the
Quinlan Opera Co., is the same dreary speci-
men of our sex as she is in the original Ger-
man. If Wagner had allowed this good lady
to live, and if he had not allowed Tann-
hauser to flirt with that hussy Venus, how
long would it have taken Elizabeth to drive
her hubby to lager beer or suicide out of
sheer boredom V Elizabeth’s luscious
soprano voice (for which in this case she
must thank Perceval Allen) is her only
excuse for not dropping dead when her er-
rant knight sings the charms of minxes in
the Hall of Song. The Court ladies and
early Thuringian nobility were garbed in
the tablecloth style of dress which belongs
to the 13th century—so far as we know.
When Society dragged down a window cur-
tain or a large green or blue tablecloth, and
flung it over its shoulders, it was almost
ready for a party. The ladies of the Thur-
ingian Court have the meek appearance of
caged doves. Elizabeth, who is too good
to live, makes a robust corpse, to heavenly
music, in the last act. Whether you gain
anything by having your remains set to
music I know not, but it is a kindly com-
pliment.
Hugh Ward went off in the mammoth
Niagara for a few months. Business, and
a rest of sorts for a very tired theatrical
manager, and a kiss to Mother —who has
been waiting five years for it in the U.S. —
are included in the traveller’s kit. H.W.
hasn’t got the slab of marble and iron
in his temperament that gave the late J. C.
Williamson such a pull in dealing with the
swollen heads of mummers in the front ranks
of the profession. When these constella-
tions, sheltered behind a long contract,
bounded too hard against the late Chief,
they hit something as soft as Aberdeen
granite. And the granite wasn’t avoiding
the fray either: in fact, it was rushing at
it with mouth open, clamoring for
battle. Now the fray bounds against a more
complicated mixture of strength and senti-
ment, and the bump is mutual. Innumerable
Sydney charities have also marked H.W.
for their own. On the Niagara he is going
to eat his breakfast bacon in peace, instead
of storming it through a paper blizzard of
begging letters.
The first night of “Louise” packed Her
Majesty’s to the last air-hole. The d.c.
steps were rushed by hordes of desperate
invaders, who were occasionally swent back
like flies by hard-worked ushers. Society,
which is getting its blood up in the matter
of early hours, motored to the opera by
7 p.m.
Our Most Expensive People, having fallen
into their places when conductor Voghera
glided on to his perch, the prelude of
“Louise” floated peacefully across the
gloom. The French atmosphere of this fas-
cinating musical romance begins with the
soup and vitl Ordinaire . Louise, after

green velveteen coat and Louise—sulks’ to

thump of her iron on the ironing board
and Jhlidn’s pleasing tehor occasionally falls
off the opposite terrace, Later on, ‘ when
work-girl Louise elopes with her pltmm
sweetheart, the lights of Paris gleam like
will-o’-the-wisps across the purple night,
After getting back to Duty and a sick
father, the girl flings herself out of the

act, a crowded house cackled its delight,
Wagner is a religion, Charpentier is Life!
Mrs, Sydney Jamieson rose in her seat, in
a foam of white draperies, like a tall, pale
lily, The Alfred Lee pair were higher up

“Within the Law,” now showing the
domestic habits of N’York blackmailers and
outlaws in general at the Criterion, gets into
its stride with the usual cyclone of luggage.
After young Gilder (Eric Maxon) has hurled
his personal effects on the floor of the paren-
tal emporium, the play really begins in the
bustling United States fashion, with the
traveller’s arrival and a taxi eating
up dollars outside. Muriel Starr, the
fascinating Mary Turner of the cast,
still teaches the right (i.e., legal)
way of doing wrong things that look
as clear as mud, and does it in a voice
that comes out of her round white throat like
a streak of clotted cream. When an Amur-
kan actress as attractive as Miss Starr talks
through her tears (Act 1) in tones that
would coax young birds out of their nests,
her career of stage crime (Within the Law)
begins with the entire sympathy of the audi-
ence. This is so bad for the audience that
its morals are only saved in Act IV. Then is
the scapegoat, Joe Carson, offered up as a
sacrifice to a prospective hanging.
“Dandy Dick” will be produced at the
Criterion on November 8. This matinee,
under the direction of John R. Allen, is
organised to puch some extra cash into the
yawning coffers of the Foundling Home,
Waitara. Vice-presidents Mrs. John McCor-
mack, Mrs. Bull and Mrs. John Toohey
(who bustles off to Europe later in the
month) are the chief conspirators.
Artist Florence Rodway is finishing a
miniature of the blonde beauty of youthful
Mabel Preston. The girl’s wedding jyill
occur in two or three weeks, with Roy King,
occur shortly with Roy King, a grandson of
the late Mrs. Thorne, as groom.
Phillips Fox is showing some charming
fantasies in frocks at his exhibition of pic-
tures in Vickery’s Chambers. Mr. Fox,
who was the first Australian to snatch the
gold medal from all comers at the Paris
Salon some time back, knows how to clothe
his lovely ladies. After the hideous orgy of
grotesque rags that flaunted through recent
revels in this town a gracefully-garbed
woman, even on canvas, is refreshing for
sore eyes. Two huge pictures, “The Arbor”
and “Lamplight” are full of subtle charm —
mostly feminine. Artist Fox is not above
painting pretty women, and he depicts an
alluring Titian-haired beauty in two or
three poses. Emerald green is a gorgeous
setting for this damsel. The red-haired girl
who sees this vision under the gloom and
shadow of a green sunshade will probably
dash off to clothe herself in the tints of
young grass. Mauve is another favorite
Phillips Fox environment for these creamy
skinned women with hair like burnished
bronze. An Eve or two, dressed in light and
shade from overhead herbage, may be com-
mended to students who look for Garden of
Eden effects as they used to be beside the
Euphrates. i
Another development in the domestic help
problem! After an exhausting morning, m
which she had been cross-examined in three
registry offices as to the size of her family
and the number of visitors she encouraged
at her house, Mrs. Turning Worm ventured
to ask an unlikely-looking damsel if she
had any references. “Well, not ’xactly,
said the* goddess of the frying-pan, “but 1 ve
got a vaccinatun certif’cate.”
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

R I( a^ th f Start we Wish t 0 clearl y stat e that we are not offering this
Motor-Cycle as a “cheap” machine. We claim that it is a great
aa ue *P* f° r f 65 because every part, both stationary and
moving, is structurally perfect.
We build this Motor-Cycle in our own workshops, to a special design for
Australian road conditions.
Ihe immense H P. enables a rider to skim up the most difficult grade, bul
the throttle-contro l is so perfect that riding is safe in the most crowded
traffic.
The Carburetter is a very economical Single Jet pattern, and is accompanied
by the dust-proof, gear-driven Bosch Ball-Bearing Magneto.
The Engine fitted to this Motor-Cycle is the nuggety J.A.P., or other high-
grade Engine.
The frame is especially strong and light, with saddle-pillar lowered to give
comfortable seat.
As this is “our own” manufacture, we are careful to see that each machine
is turned out in true, workmanlike manner—perfect from the brazing of the
frame to the fitting of the belt.
It carries our fullest guarantee, and can be relied on to work as smoothly
and sweetly on country tracks as it will on city blocks.
Our Catalogue No. 836 gives further details, and we will
send copies post free on request.
Sydney residents are invited to call and inspect our
several Motor-Cycles.
Our Showroom is open every Friday evening till 9,

ERNEST McINTOSH, General Manager.
“Londoner”: The J. C. Williamson Co. employe*
who complains in the current issue of the Theatre
about the alleged “lack of understanding” on the mrt
of Australian playgoers has obviously never been out
side the Commonwealth. Australia has many faults—
among others the habit of producing cocksure denre
ciators of itself, and clamant shouters of decaveri
fish—but stupidity is not one of them. As a matter
of fact, it is the Australian’s natural astuteness d*
veloped highly by his national system of Socialised
education, that makes him such a difficult subject
to cater for, whether as an employee, or as a patron
of the Government or privately-owned transit an,
other services, or as a theatre-goer. The maioritv
of Britishers are satisfied with very little in the wav
of art, comfort and the like. (I speak, of course of
the poorer and middle classes, and in no sense of’the
richer class, which demands and sees that it gets
unexampled merit, luxury, etc.) In Australia there
is practically no class so indigent, and hence so
unsophisticated, as not to know when it is being
put upon. That is why Australia has so many little
strikes. That, also, is the explanation of the usually
rapid settlement of these disturbances. The local
masters know that the men know, and act accord
ingly. Only in the rare cases where the men are
wantonly fractious is there prolonged trouble. It i s
the same in the theatre-going world, Australian
audiences are very little impressed by names, in which
respect they differ from British, and more especially
London, audiences. After the first week, or, at the
most, the first fortnight, they take visiting enter-
tainers on their merits absolutely. This is madden-
ing to theatrical managers, press agents, and the
often ageing or has-been stars themselves, all of
whom look, as a matter of course, to “Colonials” for
a blind acceptance of the verdict of past generations
But it is no evidence of “lack of understanding” on
Australia’s part. By the way, J. C. Williamson never
took the view of Australians that the journalistic
employee of the firm which he founded appears to
take. He asserted persistently that Australian audi-
ences were the most discerning and critical in the
world. But he mightn’t have believed it, in his
heart. He made nearly a quarter of a million out of
them, and that is worth a little flattery.
May Yohe, who achieved notoriety first as a warbler
of coon ditties and a more-or-less elegant wearer of
male attire, and, later, as the lawfully wedded and
just as lawfully divorced missus of Lord Francis
Hope, is collaborating with “Smiler” Hales in an
alleged story of her life. The lady, for a start, denies
that she has been married five times. “I have been
married only twice,” she alleges. “The first time
was a novelty, the second a disaster.” Great and
marvellous are her accounts of the jewels which have
been presented to her. A 10,000-guinea necklace was
tossed casually across to her by a gent who was sit-
ting at dinner with her. “There must be something
uncanny about my neck,” writes May (or Hales),
“Such a lot of meiF have wanted to hang things
upon it.” Having acquired several barrow-loads of
jewels, May appears to have spent most of her time
in being robbed of the gauds. An opal bracelet,
which was forced upon her when she was in this
country, was stolen from her; and in Maoriland a
great sportsman “presented me with a boar’s tusk
mounted in gold, and set with unique opals,” which
unfortunately was snatched from May’s dress when
she didn’t happen to be looking. Passing lightly from
these amazing jewel robberies, May mentions her in-
troduction to the late royal Edward, who was graci-
ously pleased to favorably comment upon her figure.
Her meeting and marriage with Lord Francis Hope
and her subsequent elopement with Captain Puttna-
ham Bradley Strong (May gives him his full title, as
the heroine always does to the villain in melodrama),
son of the Mayor of N’Yark, are described with a
wealth of intimate detail. She met Strong on board
an Atlantic liner, and (she alleges) took an instinc-
tive dislike to him, “but such was his magnetic per-
sonality that five hours after being introduced to
him I was manicuring the gentleman’s hands as we
sat on deck.” In time the two ran off to Japan.
Then they returned to Yankeeland, and after she
had kept Strong for a while in wine, cigars and
other necessaries of life, the gent left her in search
of fresher loves and houris new. May is moved to
reflect with regret that she might have been Duchess
of Newcastle, “only I threw that prize away because
a man who. to-day, I would not give a shoe-string
for, hypnotised me and spoilt my life.” The lady
visited Australia in a strictly unprofessional capacity
with her tame white Hope, and she writes at length
of the visit. Before she left Melbourne a squatter
or tea-planter, or something, had her cabin trans-
formed into “a representation of a bush scene, crowned
with gorgeous sub-tropical flowers.” Also, she col-
lected a few tons more jewellery, and, as usual, was
robbed of it. She speaks of sitting in the starlight
with “hard-headed business men,” who used to spout
Gordon’s verses to her. Among the gentlemen who
had the honor of ministering to her entertainment
were “Jack” Want, Barton, Purves and “Sir Charles
Kingston, the uncrowned king of South Australia.”
May makes no mention of having visited these parts
professionally. She must have forgotten that she
started her stage career in Melbourne years ago with
a vaudeville co. bossed by Frank Clarke at the old
Victoria Hall, in Bourke-street.
From the back pew of the church that
Dill Macky left for good last week:—
Except for a few years the Scots’ Church, at the
head of Jamieson-street, Sydney, has ever since its
foundation been the most militant tabernacle in Aus-
tralia. This was owing to the character of its two
longest-ruling pastors, Lang and Macky. The two
men were much alike. Neither cared a rap about
any authority, political or ecclesiastical; each pos-
sessed wide sympathies; and both lacked the self-
protective instinct. Lang, however, discharged his
force at large objects, whereas Mackv fired at little
ones. Lang was big-bore, Macky small-bore. But the
metal and ammunition were the same. The lay
committee of the church was often puzzled to know
what to do with the pulpiteers; but in the days
between Lang and Macky they were more puzzled to
know what to do with the pews. “Scots’ ” had been
instrumental in bringing about the disestablishment
of the Anglican and all other churches in Australia.
Some of the committee would have liked a share of
the State subsidies, but Lang talked them over. Then
he became a member of Parliament solely to talk
that body over. When he had secured the abolition
of State aid he withdrew from Parliament. Lang
was as much of a bigot as Dill Macky, but the latter
metaphorically threw stones at Papist windows, while
the former introduced Scotch Presbyterian immi-
grants to outnumber the Roman Catholic immigrants
from the west of Ireland. The Presbyterian Synod
deposed Lang; it attempted the same thing with
Macky. Lang replied by formally deposing the
Synod ; had matters gone to an extreme, Macky would
have done the same.
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 20, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The procession of fancy sets and outburst
of vice-regal pomp at the Newsboys’ Ball
was billed for 10 o’clock; but G.-G. Denman,
liis lady and party came early like ordinary
folk, and performed some of the gyrations
that preceded the official lancers on the pro-
gramme. A son of one of the Best People,
who was commanded to waltz with' her Ex.,
tlooked stunned by the honor thrust upon
liim; but he rallied bravely and glode about
like a man in a dream. A Gentleman Help
then steered Mrs. Pearson into the vortex,
■and soon the dais was almost deserted. The
■committee seemed somewhat disturbed by
■this departure from precedent and vice-regal
tradition. Denman alone resisted the music
and chatted brightly to Mrs. Fred Payne.
John Madden suddenly disappeared from
view ; no one actually saw him dancing, but
he is suspected. Eventually the escaped
notabilities were recaptured and arranged in
proper order. Her Ex.’s diamonds blazed
above flushed cheeks; Mrs. Pearsqn’s big
brown eyes looked mischief; and Miss
Knatchbull-Hugessen simply giggled with
delight inside her blue frock. Even the Mad-
den dame relaxed somewhat. Mrs. Secre-
tary Tolhurst led a set of powder and patch
dames in black gowns. These formed them-
selves into a guard of honor. Treasurer Lesly
Madden, in purple velvet, flanked the party.
Some exceptionally shy newsboys presented
bouquets, and the sons of the local peerage
supnorted banners inscribed with the names
of newspapers. The Grey-Smiths, Clarkes
and other elevated young persons led a lolly
stick set in pink and white. Mrs. Burston,
in a gorgeous frock, chaperoned two daugh-
ters with wonderful hair, and gave an eye to
Miss Meekie de Bavay, who was dressed as
a rose basket. Mrs. Melville, of Kew (she
used to be Eileen Barrett) wore the proud
air of a just-returned bride. Another re-
turned honeymooner was Mrs. Byrne, for-
merly Miss Tolhurst. Phyllis Clegg danced
all the time with her fiance, Simon Fraser.
In the intervals she collected congratula-
tions. Do.y Bird and Roma Clarke (ticket
secretaries) mentally calculated how many
people had been kept away by the rain. Mrs.
J. C. Syme, Mrs. Charlie Forrest and Mrs.
Willie Sharp set in a cosy balcony room and
gossiped. Mrs. George Chirnside and Mrs.
Shelton were among the hair-powder dames.
A visitor from oversea caused a sensation
by wearing her hair piled up into what were
supposed to be the newest Parisian puffs.
Blood-red roses and ribbons hung from the
ceiling, and the supper tables of the most
deserving were smothered with scarlet carna-
tions.
Auntie Phipps is engaged, and to our own
Jeff Kiddle. They are both in India —or
were a few short weeks ago. Jeff’s father
departed this life recently and left his son
heaps of money, so the financial road is easy.
The Austral Salon welcomed the Denman
ladv home in sober fashion. No unseemly
crush was permitted in this austere roost.
“She must be tired of flowers,” said the com-
mittee, and forthwith a few motored Salon-
ites hurried out into the country and brought
back some samples of scrub —nice young
spring gums for the most part. The stair-
case and entrance were smothered with
leaves, and the distinguished visitor, on ap-
proaching the domain, inhaled delightedly
and murmured, “The Bush !” The Madden
dame stationed herself at the head of the
stairs, and Mrs. Hennessy stood ready by the
chairs to superintend the seating of the nota-
bilities. That tremendous business finished,
a concert was turned on, and everybody
talked at once.
“Johanna” sits reproved. The announce-
ment (Oct. 9) that Guy Madden intended to
“sling the law and go on the land,” is here-
with declared, on the authority of the young
man himself, to be incorrect. Whether it is
more incorrect in its allusion to the Law
than in the reference to the Land the de-
clarer hath not nointed out. The one thing
certain is that Guy Madden has not decided
to do both the things he was charged with
being about to do.
The widow Langlands Jack, who is billed
for matrimony once more, invited her chums
to lunch at her Toorak place to talk it over
and drink farewell to the lonely but inde-
pendent life in tea. The room for the mid-
day spread was darkened romantically with
heavy curtains, and lighted again with lamps
with tinted shades.
Keating, the curly-haired Tasmanian sena-
tor, is establishing his wife and family at
a Victorian seaside resort, and steaming
away to the Islands in search of sleep. In-
somnia has been troubling him lately, so his
doctor has advised him to give politics a rest
and get away for a spell.
Marjorie, the daughter of the Willie
Sharps, whose w T ealth is in timber stacks, is
booked to marry Eric Currie, early next
Eric is ill just now, and his devoted
fiancee (all fiancbes are devoted) gave up
her place in the _ powder puff set, at the
Newsboys’ Ball, in order to read to him.
Justice Hodges’ daughter Ethel, who is
travelling in England, has just been getting
dad’s blessing by post. Her ,fiancd is a
younger brother of Captain Boyle, who once
Gentleman Helped at Government House.
He is also the youngest son of the Earl of
Glasgow.
Maudie Fenner, the quiet little sister of
Mrs. Pursey Chirnside, must be a good travel-
ling companion. Mrs. Stuart Murray, who
is recovering from an illness, has carried the
young person off with her for a jaunt to
Java. This is the third Lime that Maudie
has been abducted by travelling matrons.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart is chaperoning a beau-
tiful youth from Sydney. His name is Pres-
ton, and he is giving a dinner to an assort-
ment of pretty girls, at the Oriental Hotel.
Mrs. Stuart is choosing the blue and purple
hairpins and powder puffs necessary for such
an event.
Cards are flying round for various Henley
sprees, and the mud barges and other
humble craft are putting on the first coats
of their thin disguises. Gaud Mayor
Hennessy and his dame are in the lead with
offerings of hospitality on a dredge, or some-
thing of the kind.
Caulfield Cup Saturday was heavy with
rain that did not fall; but it scared off a
lot of the frocks. The blue plush vice-regal
pen had its share of dress sensations. The
Denman lady was the most simply garbed
member of the party. She ran up the steps
joyously in a blue frock and a big sailor
hat with ribbon tails hanging down her
back. Sister Mrs. Pearson looked sallow
under the influence of a blood-red gown,
which was crimped voluminously round her
like a sunray lamp shade, and boasted an
enormous Toby collar. Miss Knatcbbull-
Hugessen was under the tiniest little pot hat
made of purple straw", and inside a freak
coat made of cretonne with a string fringe
—really an adapted chair-cover. The G.-G.
and staff supported dazzling silk hats, and
Help Burnham added a color touch with a
blue bow tie. John Madden was shadowed
by a brace of local Helps, who got very dusty
and tousled in the performance of their book-
maker devotions. Only the imported Helps
seem to retain that speckless look through a
trying afternoon. Rupert Clarke and his
large following condoled with one another
over the scratching of Audacity. Rupert looks
very spruce and well, though his bald patch
is spreading. His lady wore a neat black
velvet suit with an old picture lace collar.
Spectators on the right side saw a neat black
silk nether limb with a blazing diamond in
the garter. Over this neat rig she slung a
black kilt. This over-garment, which was
held in place with shell beads, was hitched
up every few yards. It created the expected
sensation. Mrs. Russell Clarke, who has
grown plumper since her foreign wander-
ings, was one of the best-dressed women on
view. < The G.-G. gossiped with this black-
clad vision and her husband in the centre of
the lawn. Mrs. Alan Currie showed a small,
pale _ face set in a frame of grey fixings.
Willie Kelly wore tobacco-brown clothes and
smoked a huge cigar without a trace of fear.
Dorothy Menzies wore a feathered hat that
changed color every time she moved. She
posed carefully on the lawn in close proxim-
ity to a French race frock topped
with a hat like a white plaster monument.
The wearer of these things looked pale with
anxiety, but gallantlv stood her ground. The
social event of the afternoon was the per-
formance of a fandango or jig by a stout
lady whose half-crown horse happened to
pass the winning-post first. “Billy” Clegg
wore her hat at a jaunty angle, and had
her new fiance, Simon Fraser, at her elbow.
Mrs. Miller looked like a vision of youth
renewed with daisies in her hat. The Caul-
field roses nodded knowingly above much
good food, and appointments were booked
in every direction for the Melbourne Cup
frivols. The annual frenzy is upon us.
„ Three Australian artists, George Coates,
Fred Leist and Will Dyson, were holiday-
making at a French watering-place near
Boulogne when the last mail left. The
chief diversion seems to have been sea-bath-
ing and Dyson comments on the exceeding
fatness _of the French female habitually in
the swim. “It seems to me no French
woman dreams of forcing herself into her
little sister’s bathing gown, and launching
herself into_ the sea, until she scales up-
wards of 15 stone, and you couldn’t sink
her with the stock of a rolling mill. Talk
about casting fat on the troubled waters!
We had 20 in this afternoon, any one of
whom might have made the fortune of a
New York dime museum. I begin to under-
stand why most English people pronounce
Boulogne ‘Balloon.’ ”
Mrs. Hennessy and a committee are to
shortly discuss ways and means of spending
the money raked in by the Rieke Parker
benefit concert. The young pianiste did very
well out of her show, and the only thing left
to do is to sit down and plan out the best
method of making the sovereigns go a long
way.
Bertha Merfield’s decorative show, in the
upper room of the Athenseum, is closing its
doors as this Bulletin appears. Some tall
white gums, with the sun-glow showing on
their bunch tops, were very taking, and I
would like to have stolen in by night and
abstracted some twisted ti-tree studies with
backgrounds of blue and grey-green sea. The
Michaelis daughters came along on the first
day (October 15), and carefully inspected
the show. Herds of the artistic rich climbed
the wearisome stairs, which were decorated
half-way up with a severe notice: “DON T
TEAR UP AND THROW CATALOGUES
ABOUT.” lam sure none of the plump and
breathless picture-gazers would have thought
of tearing up those stairs, even to see the
Merfield pictures, and as for heaving printed
matter around promiscuously—why, the
idea is preposterous.
Will Longstaff is billed to judge pictures
for a Goulburn Valley art show, at Shep-
parton. the place where cousin Jack Long-
staff originated. Will is at present working
at high pressure on portraits, and is much
too busy to have a show of his own. “You
can’t show this stuff,” he says, indicating a
studio portrait half finished. “The owners
always seem to want them home before the
paint’s dry.” He has just painted the
youngest Watson daughter, in the most
modern of flapper dance frocks —cute little
split skirt, silk stockings and all. He has
not missed the dimples in the elbow of that
fascinating young person, who is perched in
a large, black, Chinese-dragon chair.
A little opera party happened to be
stalled behind a dimpled maiden of their
acquaintance, who sat between a youthful
admirer and an elderly married man. The
party behind gasped when, as the lights
blinked out, the damsel slid her left hand
into the oldster’s ready palm and her right
into the paw of the young adorer. Thus
they sat, with time off for lighted intervals,
while the observers wondered if the oldster
and the youngster knew that it was a senti-
mental trio and not a mere duet.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—-
A large crowd turned up at the Brewster-Jones
concert on Saturday evening. He plays and
comports himself generally, without any of those
frantic mannerisms which the exasperated music-lover
has learned to expect from his idols as matters of
course. His sister, a slim, elusive maiden, with
child-like, serious eyes and a mist of dark hair (do
you get her at all, my Johanna, from this bit of
word-painting ? For myself, I am not quite sure
that I know what it means —if anything), his per-
fectly delightful sister, I repeat, played some violin
solos charmingly, and Miss Ivy Phillips sang with
much dramatic force. Mrs. H. H. Dutton acted as
accompanist. Also she played the second piano in
the Liszt “Concerto in E Flat,” and looked divine
in a frock of white satin and ninon and exquisite
lace. Amongst those who handed up flowers, and
supplied the embarrassed lion of the evening with a
laurel wreath, and applauded wildly, were Mrs. Cul-
ross and her daughters, Mr. Bob Melrose with a
party, Mr. and Mrs. David Wilkie, Miss Thomas,
Dr. Gerald Hayward, Mr. Wyatt, Captain Fletcher,
Miss Githa Russell, and Miss Gordon. Incidentally,
there was a fashionably hideous coiffure and an
opera cloak of mingled ninons that sent every
woman in the room green with envy.
Mrs. W. A. Magarey gave a tea at Lea Hurst on
Wednesday afternoon, in the course of which Miss
Martha Bruggemann and Mr. Hack sang right pleas-
ingly. The hostess wore silk muslin with inlets of
black lace, and Miss Bruggemann’s cream frock
was surmounted by a becoming black hat. Mrs.
Charles Irwin and her sister, Mrs. F. Ralph, were in
varying shades of blue, and Mrs. F. Porter wore a
black coat and skirt.
Miniaturist Bernice Edwell is still here. Some of
her work is to be included in the Federal Art
Society’s Exhibition. Vida Goldstein has just ar-
rived on a holiday, which will consist mostly of
public meetings, press interviews and lectures.
Paris Nesbit made a slight error in the very
beginning of his campaign against the coursing
iniquity. Having carefully writted the hare-harriers
he discovered, much to his disconcertment, that under
the S.P.C.A. Act, all such attacks must be delivered
within a certain time. However, the humane K.C.
is still humane, and he proposes to begin all over
again after the next coursing match.
Miss Lorna Todd, back once more from abrawd, is
staying temporarily with the Charlie Todds at Vic-
toria Square. Mrs. James Harvey is another re-
turned tripper. She has been away for a year or
so.
Urrbrae, the Peter Waites’ house at Glen Osmond,
is to become the property of the University and the
Government, to be used partly for the purpose of
agricultural education and partly as a public park.
It is one of the show places of Adelaide, being noted
particularly for its perfectly-kept garden and its
wonderful roses and stocks. With the adjoining
land, which is included in the gift, it is supposed to
be worth £40,000 or £50,000. Mr. and Mrs.
Waite are to have the right of life tenancy of the
bouse, and it has been arranged that the University
shall pay no succession duty for its share of the
gift.
Mrs. A. S. Fotheringham left last week for the
fog-bound Mecca of the affluent. But in her case
there are excuses. Her eldest daughter, Mrs.
Wynyard, has been living there since her marriage.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
“Adelaide”: After the trade advertisement on the
stage comes the depreciation of a 'trade rival —a logi-
cal sequence, perhaps, but rather startling at first.
In “The Grafters” it works out this way. Comedian
calls for So-and-So’s whisky—very particular about
the brand —name mentioned several times. When the
drink comes, he spits it out. “That’s not So-and-
So!” Proprietor is forced to taste it, and admits a
mistake: “No, that’s Such-and-Such.” Now, Such-and-
Such (you can take my word for it) is an equally
sound and equally well-known brand. It seems un-
sportsmanlike. Get the best jockey you can for your
own horse, but don’t pay him to hit another nag
over the head. My neighbor in the stalls suggested
that the actors meant to boom both brands—-that
they think any mention on the stage is boom enough.
But it is difficult to believe that any maker, or agent,
would pay good money to have his stuff named merely
as a proper thing for spitting out. Whether mana-
gers should not bar on the stage every kind of trade
advertising—which to the audience is, of course,
merely boring when not nauseating—is another and
a wider question.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Moora” : Apropos “Ginger’s” yarn about
“Russian Jack” wheeling his sick mate 700 miles
(B. 18/9/’l3). The gigantic Slav gave me the story
himself. He was trundling his wooden-wheeled
barrow to the Kimberley goldfields, and found a
stranger sick with scurvy on the roadside. After
they’d had a “pitch,” Jack pushed on to the next
water, and unloaded his barrow; then he returned
and wheeled the sick man to the same place, a dis-
tance of a few miles. It was a humanitarian per-
formance, of course; but “mulga wires” soon made
a legend of it, and the miles grew with the years.
Russian Jack, by the way, died of heart-failure just
when the Japs were whooping over the fall of Port
Arthur. The Slav’s great heart couldn’t stand that
knock. Quitting Jack, a performance commonly
quoted round the camp fires of the Eastern gold-
fields of Westralia, is held to be a record. Phil
Saunders, the very early prospector, is alleged to
have carried his fever-stricken mate 90 miles on his
back into Menzies from away east of that place.
“Old Phil” never talks about the amazing per-
formance; but many others do.
A PERFECT GENTLEMAN.
LANDLADY : "If you do not pay your bills,
Mr. Mallravers, how am Ito pay mine?"
MALTRAVERS (actor): “Madame will at least
admit that I have some delicacy. Ido not
urge her to pay hers."
“Tekelo,” from the Solomons :
Let me chip in with an answer to “B.G D.” who
jabs at “Te Bat,” for declaring that porpoise teeth
are nowadays not good currency in the Solomons.
Generalisations are always dangerous, and more dan-
gerous than usual when you try to apply them to
the Islands of the Pacific. We all know that teeth
are good trade in the Eastern Solomons, but the
Western end is another animal. Let “8.C.D.”
hawk them round the Western islands of Vella,
Ilonongo, Kulambangara, Simbo and into the Rubi
ana Lagoon, and the copra he doesn t get in exchange
for a drayload of them will surprise him.
“Gouger”; Have just met the champion
alarm signal. They are wild cockatoos, and their
watch tower is the top of the tallest trees on the
summit of Mount Fraser (N.Q.). Should anyone
approach the pack-track leading up the mountain
the birds immediately fly to the trees around the
hut of the one inhabitant, an old hatter, and give
him warning. The hatter told us he had his pet
bird, which he had taught to talk with the expen-
diture of much time and friendliness. We grinned,
and he knew why. So next day, an hour before sun-
down, he hid us in his camp, well out of sight
Presently seven cockatoos anchored in a tree above
the camp. Old George took no notice of their
screeching. Then, quite plainly, came this saluta-
tion : “Hullo, George.” “Hullo, Cocky,” answered
George. “How’s th’ tin?” yelled Cocky. “Good-
oh!” answered George. “Any corn ?” came- the..
next inquiry. “Plenty,” said George; “come down
arid geF~some.'”' Straight away the speaker flew
down, followed by his six cobbers. Old George
slung them a handful of corn, speaking clearly to
them the while. “Poor old George! Poor "old”
—etcetera. And so on. Then mv mate, in his
eagerness to see everything, showed his face. That
was enough. The birds fell over each other in their
eagerness to get away, and the last we heard of
them was the distant scream of the ringleaders—
“ George! George! George 1”
• * * .
“Elliott, Ex-Whaler”: “Stohr Ituddell”
proves himself to be a bagman of little experience
when he claims Narrandera (N.S.W.) as the kingpin
of “humming” places in Australia. Speaking by
the authority of experience, I nominate Goulburn to
knock out Narrandera. All the requirements of
civilised bagmanship are there —tucker, beer, papers,
town bands, joy-girls, etc., with easy means for solv-
ing transit problems. There’s fruit and vegetables
for the taking in proper season ; and the old brew-
ery ladled out Free Beer and soft brown sugar to
the brotherhood for years. I was once in Goulburn
for 15 weeks without defiling my hands with toil.
Furthermore, I shifted my habitat only once, and
that was to be nearer the early papers and the weed
of solace. In the same camp were, on a daily aver-
age, 30 other whalers. I suppose that, as a rule,
there must be anything between 100 and 300 bagmen
in good old Goulburn. The number varies with the
season, of course, being less in winter, for Goulburn
is just a trifle chilly from May to September.
Despite his reputation, your true whaler is no slug-
gard, but riseth about the fourth hour to await the
unwary baker, or at the sixth to approach the hotel
cook. Narrandera is miles below even Wagga, and
is no better than a dozen or so towns I could name.
In pre-irrigation days it was a mere suburb of North
Yanco, with a lot of bad beer, and more sand than
was good for it. To give bad beer away is not a
good Christian act, and the decent whaler shuns the
demoralised town that does it
* * * *
“Ginger”: I a~ted once as junior counsel
under Judge Lynch, at Finley (N.S.W.). On the
morning of Boxing Day I noticed a blown-out, dis-
consolate-looking Irishman with
a black eye sitting on the form
outside the pub. When I gave
him the office he accepted with
alacrity. As we breasted the bar
I noticed a hard-faced, loud-
dressed individual yapping to the
publican. My blown-out friend
informed me he had been robbed
and booted while he was help-
lessly drunk, whereat I melted,
and we filled them up again. Just
then a dozen men rushed into the
bar, threw a ploughline over the
man with the chess-board suit,
and hauled him out to the lamp-
post. Then they proceeded to
string him up without further
ado. My blown-out acquaint-
ance with the damaged eye spat
on his hands and charged the
crowd. I followed with equal
enthusiasm and less effect. Then
the publican joined us, and swung
a dirty right very decently. Ten
minutes later about 30 wheat
cockies left the lynchers and took
our side. Almost immediately
the rough-up ended, and a caucus
was held. The condemned man.
it seemed, was the head gee of
a band of Melbourne roughs who
had come up to earn a dishonest
penny out of the harvesters. But
they overdid it, and used the
boot freely, which fact was re-
sponsible for the proposed lynch-
ing. After a power of persuasion
the mob agreed to a compromise,
and gave the spielers an hour to get out of
the town. They got very promptly, and things
settled down. It ivas my one and only necktie
party, and I can't say I enjoyed it—the fun was
too fast.
* * * *
“-.lint”: the best-laid schemes oft turn
out stale eggs. In a beer palace recently a ftian
accidentally knocked his glass over, after consuming
half of the enjoyment, and the beautiful angel of
the pump promptly filled it again. To mine own
good self I at once said, “Friend, go thou and do
likewise.” With haste I went to the next estab-
lishment, demanded a mug of tonic, and, after
giving the animal a sharp bite, pushed the glass
over and broke it! Not only did the proprietor
refuse to give me another, but demanded, under
pain of instant death, sixpence for the tumbler.
\\ hereupon 1 forgot my manhood and broke com-
pletely down.
“Yannatherra” : He unloaded on the Bur-
rumdedbeet siding two hours three mins, ahead of
scheduled train-time. His ultimate goal was the
Melbourne Show grounds, but he purposed doing the
city generally. His “slops’’ gathered in concertina
wrinkles above his boots; the boots themselves dis-
played a liberal toilet of black paste over a ground
of tenacious blue clay; his collar bore the finger-
prints of struggle and the signs of healthy blas-
phemy ; his hair had partially submitted to binder
oil and other coaxing; his boiled rag liberally pro-
truded at wrists and belt. He carried a relic
“port ’’ of huge dimensions and a cumbrous hessian
bundle. I wondered at the lumber and asked him
if he was going to the city for good. “Aw no!
’Tain’t all clobber,” he told me; “I’m putting up at
the Calf and Mother, and I’m thinking to give the
city, blokes a treat with me gramo.”
LIMPY ON THE GREAT UNPAID.
“ Say, Boss, what you call 'im that pfeller J.P.?"
“Sort of P.M., Limpy.”
“Close up time now me P.M., too. All the ole 'hands an ’ stockmen on the river bin
made P.M. I bin steal 'nuff cattle in my time to be P.M., too, my word."
“Spider”: Away back in the old North
Coast days, when there was practically no City of
Lismore, and when Gundurumba was the capital of
the Richmond, the turf had its enthusiastic de-
votees. Club secretaries, in those old pine and
cedar days, were not too well acquainted with
A.J.C. rules, neither were such rules very necessary,
because at that time racing was racing, and stiffs
were unknown. Well, Gundurumba had a race
meeting, and such a day it was 1 Entries were re-
quired—as many as could be got—and the commit-
tee, being true sports and not out for a pot, were
not too particular about a fixed hour for closing
the nominations. A stranger came on to the course
during the meeting, and wanted to enter his horse,
the secretary, with an eye to business, inquired the
name of the prad. The owner replied, “Euphrates,”
and the secretary duly entered the new blood in his
nomination book. A little later the board showing
the entries was hoisted, and to the visitor’s surprise
his horse's name did not appear. He found the
secretary and made inquiries, and was told his
horse's name was on the board all right. The owner
assured the secretary it wasn’t, and the secretary
to satisfy him took him out to the board with a
jovial, “There y’are—l posted it myself!” And so
he had, merely making the small mistake of calling
the unknown “New Potatoes.” But that made no
difference, for he ran just as well that way and won
the Gundurumba Handicap of £1 10s. easily.
“Quidam”: writing (B
25/9/’l3) re the dreadful poison left behind bv
cyaniders, wallops the wrong dog. In the first place
sand, before being discharged from cyanide vats
water-washed in order to displace the cyanide solution 8
so that the quantity of cyanide it carries i s
minute. Secondly, cyanide is a very unstable com
pound, and soon decomposes into harmless a i
inert substances. The bulk of the consumption ?
the chemical on any cyanide plant is usually d
to this instability. In the Big Drought in Queen?
land, when ’possum poisoning was a flourishing j '
dustry, cyanide baits used the second night generall''
failed to slay the animal that took them, though on
the first night a ’possum rarely got more than 2
inches away. Some time ago a syndicate
thinking the chemical and lime in the cyanide-plant
residues in Stawcll (Vic.) would make the sand
valuable as a fertiliser, experimented; bu(; Govern-
ment analysis showed no trace of cyanide or iree
lime, even in comparatively new residues jin which
an unusually large proportion of cyanide ihad been
left at the time of discharge. As to the white in-
crustation on sand heaps, it is caused by salts
arising from the decomposition of mineral, and can
be seen on thousands of heaps that have never been
cyanided at all. It is usually most abundant after
rain, when the absorbed water, rising to the surface
by capillary action, brings up a supply of salts from
the interior of the heap. The action is similar to
that by which the alkali, so destructive at mam'
irrigation settlements, is brought up from below by
the evaporating water. These salts may be poisonous
in cases, but not because of cyanide. The decom-
position of arsenical sulphides, for instance, knight
liberate arsenic. Here, in Victoria, where many
cyanide plants have been situated in populous
towns such as Maryborough, Stawell, St. Arnaud and
Maldon, children play, “sports” exercise, and grey-
hounds and bands practise together on residue dumps,
and neither the children, the dogs nor tfie music
suffer in any way. The worst thing about the dumps
is their tendency to emigrate every time >it blows
hard, thereby promoting industry and rage on the
part of housewives. The debts that cyaniders leave
behind them are of much more importa/ice .than the
poison they deposit. If the latter were dangerous
half of \ ictoria would be dead. As things are, a
part of it is merely bankrupt.

WHISKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They lied of whiskers, wild and strong,
That men in distant bushlands wore—
Of whiskers red, and fierce, and strong;
The frightful, scrub that Ryan bore,
In which his Cochiri-chickens used
To go to roost. '
They lied of Andy’s golden bunch,
Of which the Groper farmers say
That, sleeping soundly after lunch,
He had them garnered with the hay;
And with them later, from a shelf,
He hanged himself.
Of Billy's growth, so thick and black,
That, when he lay in drink one day,
A carter, passing down the track,
Took bunch and Bill and all away,
And sold the lot to dealers fair
In hides and hair.
But ne’er did man a beard adorn
Like that of Mann, Ned took his oath.
When fleeing from his wife one morn
Mann ran into his wondrous growth,
And was entirely bushed in there
For half a year!

“S. S. Severn”: It was my first person-
ally-conducted operation. Kypa, a Ki-wai
(Papua) carrier, went kava-kava (insane) and fled up
a pafiu tree. Three days he sat on a giant frond
and Cast cocoanuts at the heads of the orderlies who
tried to entice him down. The morning of the
fourth day Larin passed up the track carrying a
young python slung over a stick. When Kypa saw
the snake he shinned down the palm, snatched the
crawler from Laria, ate it raw, and then began to
sing. Twelve days and nights in hospital he sang,
almost without ceasing. Beset with fear of kuku-
kuku and snakes and dreadful storms, his incessant
howling song nearly sent me kava-kava too.
Kukane,” I said to the head orderly, “what fashion
this, all the time sing sing?” “Sinabada,” sug-
gested Kukane, saluting gravely, “more better I hit
him along head.” Which meant that, if I ap-
proved, the best way to silence that song was to
slay it. I tried a new medicine instead, and eventu-
ally the sick man became quiet. With the ceasing
of his song he developed a temperature. I didn’t
want him to die (I had been in charge of the hos-
pital for eight months, and no one was any the
worse). So when 1 knew it wasn’t malarial, I told
Kukane to look for lumps. He found one, a deep-
seated filarial abscess. With about 10 boys holding
Kypa down I began to give the anaesthetic, when
suddenly a nasty thought hit me. Supposing he
died under ether! I looked round the row of black
faces and felt absurdly alone. “Kukane,” I said,
“suppose this boy he die?” “O Sinabada,” he
chortled reassuringly, “supposing him die T put him
along hole. I no talk.” This cheered me up
greatly, especially as the patient didn’t die.
THE HINT DIRECT.
MR. GASBAGG : “Well, I must confess I like
a man who says the right thing at the
right moment.”
MR. DRYBOY : “My oath! Especially when
you’re dying for a drink! ”
“Pint”: Re “9-3-31” (B. 4/9/T3) and the
clod he heaves at the paspalum “curse” of the
N.S.W. cow-country. It is merely the story of the
tired cocky over again. He planted the grass; he
watched it grow thicker and thicker year after year ;
he saw it shoving out all other grasses, yet still
allowed it to seed and thicken and smother itself.
In fact, he did nothing till the cream supply—or,
rather, the cream cheque—went down. When that
happened the backbone of the country awoke, and,
being a good Anti-Socialist, rushed right away to
the State, crying to be fed with a bigger spoon.
he followed the example of a small minority
of North Ccast cow cockies, and harrowed his pas-
palum now and then, as well as mowing it before
the seed ripened, his cheque would to-day be just as
big and the grass as prime a favorite with Nancy
as they were 10 years ago. In these circumstances
it is arrant folly to curse paspalum. What the
choked cockies ought to curse is their own sloth.
THE LAST LAP.
FOWLHOUSE HENRY (lately con-
verted): “Afore the spirit ov
repentance gets a fair holt of

Army ter-morrer."
“Gordon G.” : “8.J.11.0." need not have
gone to Amurkah for geographers’ blunders about
Australia (B. 18/9/’]3). Here are a few excerpts
from one Meiklejohn, whose book has run through
many editions and is one of the most widely used
geographies in the principal schools and colleges in
England and—God save us I—Australia.1 —Australia. Not only
does he exhibit woeful ignorance about our much
maligned continent, but practically all his aberra-
tions are dead against us: —
Australia is full of oddities—mammals lay eggs
and cherries have their stones outside. Quadrupeds
run on two feet, trees give little shade, and many
birds have no song. Australia has only one river
of any size and importance, and that does not reach
the sea, and sometimes does not flow at all. The
larger part of the interior consists of the most for-
bidding and desolate regions on the face of the
globe. Australia, in many ways more African than
Africa itself, is essentially the land of wastes and
steppes.
The next bit of information concerns our sunny
climate:—-
Dry heat is the characteristic of the climate of
Australia, and this is found all over the Continent.
Captain Sturt in the desert interior found the ther-
mometer rise to 127 deg. and the mercury then
burst the tube. Every screw came out of the boxes,
the horn handles of instruments and combs split up
into fine lamina, the lead dropped out of the
pencils, the hair stopped growing and the fingers
became as brittle as glass.
Michael Meiklejohn should have been our immigra-
tion hoomster. This anent the Ma State:—
The population of this colony gives only about
four persons to the square mile. This is due to
three causes— (a) Its mineral treasures are thinlv
distributed, (6) the arable lands occur as oases
dotted at wide intervals over the country, (c) the
rainfall at a distance of 150 miles inland ceases to
be sufficient for crops.
But, thank Heaven, if Meiklejack never heard of
the Riverina, the greatest wheat belt in Australia,
no part of it less than 200 miles from the sea, he
knows all about the Sandwich Islands:—
Jhe Sandwich Islands people are a set of gav and
lgm-hearted idlers. They g'allop on their ponies
over the white sands and - disport themselves on the
white crests of the surging billows.
to break that spell by any kind of comment seems
akin to sacrilege. Yet—where are the Sandwich
Islands? The map has called them the Hawaiian
Islands for about as many years as anybody remem-
bers. All through the reigns of Kamehameha 1.,
11., 111., IV., V., also Lunalilo and David Kalakana
and Mrs. Lydia Dominis, who described herself as
Queen Liliuokalani, the group was seldom known as
the Sandwich Islands save in missionary records and
old fly-bitten maps of the Captain Cook era. For
13 years the archipelago has been, officially, the
Hawaiian Territory of the United States. And the
Hawaiian doesn’t gallop on his pony more than the
average. In fact, he is much addicted to the tram-
car nowadays. The principal animals of the islands
are bats, hogs, dogs, rats, 500 different kinds of
beetle, cockroaches, locusts, centipedes, scorpions,
wasps and white ants. Also there are some cabs and
a few whales.
"Reka” : Travelling by the usual Maori -
land train isn’t generally considered a dangerously
rapid way of getting across country, but it is quite
fast enough to satisfy the Hawkes Bay people. They
had some awful excitement there a while ago, when
the Railway Department shipped them an engine
that insisted on putting up records. Trains that had
hem content to amble into the station anywhere
from three-quarters to an hour after schedule time
suddenly began to arrive 10 to 15 minutes
ahead, while the wayside population strained its
heart in running to catch them, and used dreadful
language when they found that the thing wasn’t due
to leave for quite a long time. The drivers were
commanded to be more careful, but complained that
they couldn’t help it, as the engine had a mania for
hurrying. The Departmental heads were requested to
alter the timetable; but they replied that, to avoid
accidents, it was considered expedient to remove the
engine. So the hustling vehicle lost its billet, the
I rains saunter in as in days of old, and everybody
is happy and gradual once more.
Tiaki’ : IJenare has deteriorated consid-
erably in physique, and is not the goods he was be-
fore Christianity and civilisation flooded the Maori
maiket. One of him, a Te Aute college product,
employed as an interpreter's clerk, was (for small-
pox reasons) detained by the railway officials at the
Waipukurau station, and had to put up with the
frigidity of a well-tended and spacious waiting-
room. He caught a chill and had to tramp a
whole mile and a half to a Maori friend’s place. In
a week’s time a doctor pronounced him as being just
jerked out of the jaws of death, and he returned to
a life of leases and succession orders. When the
assault was made on Te-Ngutu-o-te-Manu (where
'° n ( y ern P resigned his commission) there were
300 “loyal” Wanganuis with the expedition. They
were entirely naked except for a rapaki (waist
garment) and a cartridge belt. This was in the
middle of winter; yet every one of the warriors
returned from the warpath in good order and ™
dition, except that some of their feet were a im?'

"Eddyson”: The worst of them nil Was
Fairer. He came to Waddy in the spring, when the
pimples were in bloom, and took over Starr’s curious
little rough-hewn bluestone home. Farrer was
thin, trim type, perhaps 46, whose commonplace'
well-worn clothes had always a satisfactory Inn-
about them, and who talked like a man with some
little literary finish. Thomas John Farrer built i
high, corrugated-iron fence about the stone house
ran three lines of barbed wire along above that, ami
then set up several notices on poles: “Abandon Hope
She Who Enters Here,” “Woman Traps Laid ” and
“Females Strictly Not Admitted.” Then Farrer
settled down in apparent comfort and seeming
security. In male society he was exceedingly genial
and sufficiently sane. He seemed to have money
enough to live on in comparative comfort, but he
said he could never be wholly happy in the same
world with woman. When the Church of England
parson from Yarraman visited him, he said: “Sir 1
cannot attend a church that is open to women. ]
have no use for a heaven that is not entirely ‘For
Men Only!’” Farrer had selected Waddy, after
travelling the world over, as the place with the
fewest natural disadvantages (meaning women)
combined with a civilised man’s needful opportuni-
ties of comfortable living. His one formidable
weapon of defence was a long garden-hose of un-
common calibre, with an appliance for turning on
the water at the nozzle end. If a woman penetrated
within his gates, he turned the hose on her, and
drove her forth, without explanations or apologies.
This policy produced two stand-up fights and four
court cases in the first eight months. Farrer was
not. unwilling to fight; he found some pleasure in
confounding the Bench at Yarraman with legal ob-
stacles and polite insults. If you are simple enough
you may think this course of conduct would tend to
alienate female sympathy from Thomas John Farrer.
It did nothing of the kind ; on the contrary, it pro-
voked the very keenest interest among women, and
no man in the country was more sought after than
the recluse of Waddy. Picnics of women came out
from Yarraman, and camped in the vicinity of
Farrer’s front gate; there were pilgrimages of young
maiden ladies from many distant places, ostensible
to view the flat scenery of Waddy, actually infused
with the hope of getting a peep at the celebrated
woman-hater. On many occasions Farrer had to
scour too-enterprising excursionists off his fence with
the hose. One morning when the gardener had left
the gate on the latch, a large, hard-faced, square-
jawed woman, with a hint of whiskers, and pince-
nez glasses on her Wellingtonian nose, marched
straight into the grounds, and was upon Thomas
John before he realised what was coming to him.
“I represent the New Australian Provident Assur-
ance Society,” said the creature in a deep voice.
I arrer backed away. The representative of the
A.P.A. followed him up. Farrer secured his hose.
The stream struck the she-canvasser in the breast.
She was set back for a moment, but not beaten. In
a new mood she went at Farrer. She battled against
the stream, she cornered Farrer, and she fought him
for the hose. Then for a full 20 minutes that dom-
inant female washed and slushed Farrer about his
own garden. 1 left Waddy a week later. When I
returned on a visit to the parental floor, I found
h arrer’s notices all down, the iron fence gone, and
Thomas John at work among his flowers. On the
verandah sat the late representative of the N.A.P.A.,
reading. “I’ve got no need to keep the women off
now,” Farrer explained weakly. “She does it.”
Farrer had married her, or she had married Farrer.
Farrer drew me aside before I left. “After all, she
isn t very lik one, is she?” said he, anxiously. She
wasn’t.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS.
"Sliahtapike” : An unclaimed boy of three
who was delivered at the Burnley (Vic.) police
station the other afternoon described his father as
“a big man who eats beer.” The clue is being
vigorously pursued. The missing parent is evidently
some ingenious bloke who has been driven by the
high cost of living to seek out a new staple article
of diet. Many people are bowed down by the delu-
sion that the beer habit is a vile one; yet where
could you get a more nourishing food than good beer
properly chewed, not bolted? I am no prophet, but
I can see the beginning of a great revolution in
dietetics. I can see the hash-foundry menus of the
new age running thus: —
Beer Soup.
Curried Beer. Jugged Beer.
Compote op Beer.
Beer Roll.
Then we will all be “big” men like the pioneer of
the movement, and in those days the decadent tee-tee
will have to hold his peace or get pelted with sir-
loins of beef and other waste products till the pro-
cess terminates fatally.
SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long came to board at Mrs. Mann’s.
A prepossessing chap was Long:
His hair was curlier than Dan’s;
His eyes were blue and very fine,
Suggestive of the lowing kine;
And he could sing a splendid song.
Long made it known without reserve
That he was looking for a wife.
The fellow had a frightful nerve —
There were three daughters in the place,
No longer young, and plain of face.
But Long, he scooped the joy of life.
For him there was no thing too good.
The daughters kept the best for Long;
His every want was understood.
They’d wash, and darn, and mend for him,
And nothing do for me and Jim.
Dan swore it was too blanky strong.
Long stayed at Mann’s a year or so,
Then told the Misses with a sigh:
"The wife I seek, two years ago
Cleared out from me”....l’ve met him since,
In many cribs, fed like a prince,
And still lie’s seeking. So am I!
VICTORIA.

BLACK TRACKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Swart bloodhounds of the fenceless West,
Black gallopers that lead the Law,
To whom your victims stand confessed
By every lightest line they draw;
The hawks that high above von sail
Have eyes less keen to pierce the blue,
The dingo on his hunting trail
Runs slacker in the chase than you !
Your naked fathers, seeking food,
Bv signs iqion the sand grew wise.
And tracked their quarry till it stood,
And bore it home, a hard-won prize.
Now, clothed and horsed and paid in gold,
Ye ride across the selfsame sands
To track the outlaw to his hold
And leave him in his foeman’s hands !
With head upon your horse’s mane,
With eyes intent on every clue.
By swamp and river, ridge and plain,
Ye follow as the Fates pursue.
Behind you, blood on spur and heel
And roam on chain and rein and ring.
With hands that tighten on their steel,
Ride fast the troopers of the king!
The killer’s threat is in your eyes,
The falconer's and the hunter’s pride ;
Athwart your brow a vengeance lies,
Unborrowed from the band ye guide.
Ihe hate that shaped your fathers’ spears,
The wrath that armed some ancient sire,
The blood-lust of a thousand years
Comes back to fan your hearts to fire !
Yet I have seen your passions sleep,
Your hate and lust and anger die,
When, stirred by human love as deep
As ever moved a mother’s sigh,
Ye rode upon a gentler trail
And followed, through the scrubland wild,
In sorrow that ye scorned to veil,
The footprints of a lost bush child !
SCOTLAND.

I HAVE

SECOND LIFE
:W-

F/rsKint
Hundreds of thousands of people have derived
immeasurable benefits
From Sanatogen
Thousands of them have written to the proprietors
to say so. Their testimony records marvellous results,
which, until its discovery, could never have been obtained
by any means at the disposal of the physician.
Among the writers are many celebrities with whose
names
You will
be as familiar as with your own.
Tens of thousands of doctors throughout the world
have prescribed Sanatogen, which a medical authority,
writing in The Medical Press and Circular, states, “has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundredfold,’’ while,
he adds, “the wonders brought about by this prepara-
tion are no less manifold than amazing.”
This is high praise for any preparation to
Receive
but it has been endorsed by innumerable statements.
Here, for instance, is one by that famous Authoress,
Madame Sarah Grand : “ Sanatogen has done everything
for me which it is said to be able to do for cases of
nervous weakness and exhaustion. I began to take it
after nearly four years’ enforced idleness from extreme
weakness, and felt the benefit almost immediately. And
now, after taking it steadily three times a day for
twelve weeks, I find myself able to enjoy both work
and play again, and also able to do as much of both as I
ever did.”
To be so revitalised is, indeed, in Shakespeare’s
words, to receive
A Second Life
That experience may be duplicated by every reader
of these words, for Sanatogen so influences the nervous
and muscular systems, the digestion and the great blood-
making organs, that it restores the normal balance dis-
organised by illness or disease.
Sanatogen is sold by all Chemists, in tins, at 2S. 6d.,
3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d.
An int resting and instructive booklet, entitled
“ The Art of Living,” will be sent, post free, to all
who write, mentioning this paper, to A. Wulfing & Co.,

Eusiness, Robbery, etc.
“Hamer”: There was a secret ballot, the other day,
of the Tailors and Tailoresses’ Union, of Broken Hill,
the question being whether that organisation should
or should not strike in sympathy with the shop assist-
ants. Not a single vote was cast in favor of down-
ing needles. Which was a dead give-away, so far as
the loud-mouthed braggarts of the organisation were
concerned. The tailors are a peaceful crowd, and
owe as much as anybody to arbitration. But their
organisation, like every other, has its “skiters.” The
secret ballot would have given them a good oppor-
tunity to air their braggadocio while voting accord-
ing to their courage, if they hadn’t been so dashed
unanimous on the score of caution.

“Constant Curser”: Up goes the price of the
N.S.W. railway time-table to tuppence! But what's
the use of increasing the rate when frequently it
isn’t available at any price? At the end of May I
unsuccessfully demanded a time-table from half a
dozen stations on the Svdney-Albury line. In des-
peration I offered a fellow traveller a shilling for
his copy. He told me curtly that he’d paid 2s. to a
Salvationist for it. Let me here declaim against the
barbarous practice in country post-offices of keeping
directories whose ages entitle them to decent inter-
ment, and likewise denounce the youthful but in-
fected copies in Martin Place, where, recently, with
the naked eye, I observed representative germs of 15
diseases marching solemnly over a page of Joneses.
Also, there was a beetle on Smith.
* * * *
Cornsacks, within a fraction of Bd. apiece.! Every
wheat-farmer in the country is discussing the pro-
digious jump ; it is 3d. more for the three-bushel bag
than he paid two or three years ago for an envelope
big enough to hold five bushels. “What combine
hrs got us by the wool now?” he wants to know.
“No combine at all,” says the trader; the Calcutta
Faetories Act has done the damage. Till lately Ram
Bux got 4d. a day in the Calcutta mills, whence
half the world’s wheatsacks are drawn ; and a skilled
weaver couldn’t earn more than ss. a week. The
Australian lumper, who won’t handle stuff that
a non-union carter has touched, lumped these sweated
goods without a murmur; and the worse the sweat-
ing the better Australia liked it. Now that the
Indian Government is evening things up a bit, and
making the Australian farmer pay a price that looks
fabulous though it may be only fair and decent,
there is a howl. But why stop at mere howling?
Australia can produce jute, and the only reason it
didn’t produce it long ago was because it preferred
to sweat the Indian nigger. Now that India won’t
allow its nigger to lie sweated, and Australia has to
pay white-labor prices for its wheat-bags, it had
better get to work and give its own white labor the
job. The nigger on the Hoogly never will hold a
gun for Australia; on the other hand, the white
laborer who could do the nigger’s work just as well
and very likely for less, may come in very handy
some day for an important gunnery, job, too.

\ “Hamer”: A recent cable disclosed the fact that
a trick or swindle which' was highly popular in Syd-
ney, some years ago, has just been played on a Paris
bhtcher. A travelling photographer induced the
butcher to have a view of himself, his family, and
his:meat taken in front of his shop. While one of
the' malefactors was posing the crowd, his asso-
ciate g6t buSy in the shop. In Sydney the family
was usually persuaded to have its photograph in-
cluded in a view of the house. In the ensuing ex-
citement a false-alarm assistant, encumbered with a
bag of alleged photographic materials, would go in-
side and pack up any portable articles of a pawn-
able nature that were lying about. It was a fas-
cinatingly easy method of earning a living while it
lasted. I

“F.A.M.”:. A recent Bulletin article dealt with
the proposal to supplement the Panama Canal by
one cut through Nicaragua, and incidentally it was
remarked: “But Panama might, with great expense,
be made a straight sea-level cut.” There are, how-
ever, conditions which render a canal at sea-level
commercially impossible. The extreme rise and fall
of the tide at Colon, at the Atlantic end, is about
2ft.; at Panama, on the Pacific, it is about 22ft.
At mean tide the two oceans are at the same level;
but at extreme high tide, the water at the Pacific
end is 10ft. higher than at the Atlantic end, and at
extreme low tide fit is 10ft. lower. If there were
no regulating locks, say at the Panama entrance, the
difference in level at high tide would cause a strong
current to set up in the canal from the Pacific to
the Atlantic, and low tide there would be a
strong current in the opposite direction. This
would render naviga tion difficult; for should a vessel
of some size swerve, to either bank when breasting
the current, it would be difficult to prevent the craft
taking the ground. .Further, in a sea-level canal,
the bottom of the excavation would have to be
carried down 85ft, below its present level, and
throughout the whole nine miles of the Cuelebra
section an enormous additional slice of material
would have to be taken off the slopes on either side.
This would enhance the danger of sliding, which is
serious enough in a cut of the present depth, but
would be absolutely overwhelming were that cut
carried 85ft. farther down. The lock system adopted
required the removal of 212 million cubic yards; a
sea-level canal would have necessitated excavation
of 319 million cubic yards. (Note: — The Bulle-
tin admits that it has no first-class tide
expert in the office, but it is absolutely
certain that a sea-level canal was contemplated at
Panama, and only the bloated bill got in the way.
Ships grew bigger and bigger while the weary old
job was in progress, and each successive change in
the plans made the proposed ditch deeper and the
proposed sea-level canal more ruinous. Apparently
that was the only trouble. Incidentally the Re-
ligious Editor reckons that the Pacific is some feet
higher than the Atlantic, and that with a sea-level
canal enough of the Pacific would run through into
the Atlantic to make things even. The scour thus
created would greatly deepen the canal, and perhaps
the change of level would alter the climate and wash
away some undesirable half-breeds. Incidentally
the lowering of the surface of the Pacific might
bring to lig.it some sunken treasure-ships of value.
Also the rush of water might cause the wonderful
Cuelebra cut to fall in, and then there would be no
more canal, and President Wilson would commit
suicide amid the ruins of his new tariff.)
Notice posted in a Melbourne warehouse on the
approach of this season’s football finals:—
SPECIAL NOTICE.
All requests for leave of absence owing to
FUNERALS, WEDDINGS, LAME BACK, HOUSE-CLEANING,
SORE THROAT, HEADACHE, INDIGESTION, ETC.. MUST BE
HANDED IN NOT LATER THAN 10 A.M. ON THE DAY OF

It acted magically. Not one member of the staff
lost a mother or married a wife, and the health of
the whole crowd was normal.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Someone found a farth-
ing the other day in the rubbish on the site of an
old stone house recently demolished in Hunter-street,
Sydney. I do not say it as boasting of wealth, but
I am in possession of three farthings—two of the
year 1799, and’one, somewhat smaller, of 1806. The
coins are not milled on the edges, as described by
the S. M. Herald. No copper coins that I am
acquainted with have milled edges. The farth-
ings of 1799 have grooved edges, the groove, being
introduced to prevent false coining with plaster
moulds, as with this groove you couldn’t get the cast
perfect. Most historians were agreed that Parson
Johnson’s wattle-and-daub church, built by the holy
man in 1793, and burned (or alleged to have been
burned) by convicts in 1798. was on the open space
at the junction of Bligh, Hunter and Castlereagh
streets. We are told now that it was on the site
where this historic farthing was found. Perhaps the
coin was a fugitive from the collection-plate. Its
date prohibits the "supposition that, it was a coin
placed in the foundation stone of the first C. of E.
in Australasia.
“Norbell”: A par. about the Victorian Savings
Bank (B. 2/10/’l3) sets me thinking. It refers to
the account that is left in credit for a small amount
and then forgotten, which account is described as a
“nuisance.” Well, the nuisance is largely of the
bank’s own manufacture. Before I got sense enough
to try and earn a living, I was in the Melbourne
Savings Bank. It was in the ’Bo’s, at. the time John
Alsop was actuary, and that hustling little man was
very anxious to have 60,000 “open" accounts. He
had his wish in 1886. Every clerK of us—“officers”
they called us, and we loved it—was exhorted to do
his utmost to prevent people from closing their
accounts. We used all sorts of dodges, and implored
departing customers —1 mean “clients”—to at least
leave the account open with Is. Also, we told a lot
of lies about the trouble it would save us, and the
customer. I think that explains' the large number
of small balances lying inoperative for so many
years—it was worth a shilling to escape our impor-
tunities.

“T. 0.1.”: The amount of money wasted in print-
ing and binding “Votes and Proceedings” of the
Parliament of N. S. Wales must be enormous. I
attended the sale of effects of a late legislator re-
cently. Amongst the goods offered were shelves upon
shelves of “Votes and Proceedings” and other Par-
liamentary volumes. The auctioneer, himself a
legislator, could not get a bid. In despair he offered
the lot for five shillings, and still failed to get a
customer. They will, therefore, probably share the
fate of a full van-load of similar volumes belonging
to an ex-legislator, which a while ago was carted
out to the Corporation “tip” at Moore Park. Be-
tween these two lots was another of equal extent,
belonging to an ex-legislator who was being “sold
off.” No bid could be got for that ton or two
either, and the auctioneer left them for the suc-
ceeding tenant to get rid of.

“Marloo”: “Coorey’s” remarks re timber-faking
remind me. A contractor on the N.S.W. North
Coast had to execute extensive repairs to a big Gov-
ernment jetty a few years ago. Turpentine piles
were specified, as it was supposed they were least
affected by barnacles and other sea-fruit. But tur-
pen tine, as it happened, was very scarce in tw
region, so the contractor got to work on the hanrtt
est timber thereabouts. Before the repairs were nm
ceeded with, the usual city inspector hove alone tn
ask a question or two. As he approached the tim
her, he glanced at the specifications, and inauirert
“Turpentine, of course?” “Smell 'em,” said th.
contractor. The inspector bent and did so “nt
Dad, they’re genuine, all right,” he remarked Tho
contractor had prepared for the inspection by'dons
ing the ends of the piles with turps ; but for all
that, it wasn't long before those piles required re
newing.

“Pakeha”: Re the alleged dunderheaded delivery
of Australian mails in Tasmania (B. 2/10/’l3). The
boat for Burnie leaves Melbourne at 1 p.m. on Tues
days and Fridays. This hour of sailing was made
to suit the Sydney express, which at one time used
to arrive before 1 p.m., but lately has been verv
often late. The boat arrives in Burnie in most
cases between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., and the train for
Launceston leaves at 6.20. I have been in the shin
for 18 months and only twice in that time have we
missed the mail, and that was through very bad
weather. Sinre the small-nox scare, however, the
mails, though landed on the wharf, are held there for
fumigation or something : no one may come on board
till the doctor clears the ship, and he is not supposed to
do it till daylight. So at present if the mail is left it
is not the fault of th? Union Co. On Fridays, bv

“Reka”: The Maori is the aristocrat of the
Hawkes Bav district. He lives in a bungalow and
scours the country in. a motor-car. His sons and
daughters go to college, but can’t spell economy
never heard of it. At a recent meeting of the
Native Land (Qojirt the trustees of a large estate
handed up an itrem of eight guineas for the tailor-
made travelling costume cf an eleven-year-old Miss
Wikitoria, supported by other items proportionately
large. Judge Jones uplifted his hands in horror,
and commented feelingly on the dreadful expense
the lady vvould be to her husband later. The trus-
tees merely replied that the lady’s ancestral acres
could well stand the strain, and tjie item passed.
In the car the jother morning I met a very young
Maori lady gowhed ‘in a pink chiffon that cost at
least £5. She had a gay day in and around Queen-
street, returned in the evening a crumpled heap
worth about Is. 2<f., and came forth next day with a
blue velvet cloak over the pink. After that I saw
her no more, but no doubt she is now gracing the
kaanga in the remnants of her town splendor, worn
any old How.

Vendors of “non-inflammable” flannelette and
similar fabrics that burn like the very place the
Devil inhabits, and are death-traps for the unwary,
seem ’in a fair way to be checked by recent British
legislation. The Act passed at the instance of Tay-
lor, M.P. for Radcliffe, who was ip the Common-
wealth in 1911 talking profit-sharing to Chambers
of Commerce and such, imposes a £lO fine on any
draper who offers such goods for sale, unless the
stuff conforms to Home Office standards of non-
inflammability. A second offence means a £5O
fine. It ought to mean hanging on a £5O gallows.
An Australian co. now being formed- for the exploi-
tation of> a new anti-fire patent claims that it has
got hold of a ridiculously cheap and absolutely reli-
able chemical process which renders anything, from
a gossamer to a gum-tree, as impervious to fire as
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

“Dux”: These Maoris give me the pip. One of
’em blew in just now, flashed a pound-note and asked
for a couple of shilling haincombs. He haggled so
much over the price that I had to let him have two
for half a crown. He’s outside now doing mental
arithmetic and looking puzzled. I’ll bet he’s not
satisfied! P.S.—He has been in again. He reckons
I didn’t give him enough change. To satisfy him
I had to take his seven half-crowns and give him
eight florins instead. P.P.S. —The bank just rang
up to say that Jack Maori’s pound-note was a crook
one ! The scoundrel 1! !
A FLEETING PARTY AND A FAIR QUESTION!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Henry Willis, M.L.A., addressed a meeting
in the Willoughby Town Hall. Mr. P. J. Maher
was chairman. Mr. Willis said: “There is only one
true Liberal in the Parliament of New South Wales,
and that man is myself. Henry Parkes was a great
Liberal. Henry is dead, and Liberalism died with
him." Mr. Willis advocated sufficient payment of mem-
bers of Parliament in order to keep them free from
temptation.— News item.
Fair Liberals, we grieve to see
You haste away so soon;
As yet the early Beebyite
Hath not attained his noon.
Stay ! Stay 1
11. Willis, M.L.A.,
Doth promise you a boon 1
Declare, O legislators of the nation,
Hmu much you want to keep you from temptation!
We have as little cash to draw
As you —five hundred pounds!
Temptation's Nature’s second law,
• And ‘ everywhere abounds ;
Say! Say 1
What should the country pay
On these high moral grounds?
I - snow-white Ministers can not be tempted,
Are. ihey from salaries to be exempted ? 1
And if —as well might be the case—
Some godly member, prone
To meet Temptation, face to face,
Should fight it “on his own”—-
Eh? Eh?
And should he lose the day,
But not let it be known f
How would the one true Liberal remaining
Deal with the case? Will Henry start explaining.

The Marquis of Salisbury on “the better-
ment of the conditions of rural workers in
Great Britain” is an interesting exponent or
the old aristocracy’s belief in class distinc-
tion. “Why teach agricultural laborers to
want a bath by fixing bathrooms in ( then
cottages?” asked the noble Salisbury. ‘ wh)
suggest that the unskilled laborer re( 3 ull ?“
a parlor as well as a kitchen, neither batn
nor parlors making a substantial dinerenc
in public health?” In short, why not restnc
civilisation to the hereditary aristocracy ■
EXCRUCIATING RHEUMATISM.
“For years I could not get relief from the
cruciating pains of rheumatism,” writes Mrs. «*
Pierce, 1340 Sturt Street, Ballarat (Vic.),
started using Chamberlain’s Pain Balm, and
first bottle showed the merits of the balm. A
first appearance of pain now I apply hot f° m( ' l ’
tions, and have Chamberlain’s Pain Balm well ru
in, and it wards off all suffering.”*
POLITICAL
POINTS
The next case of suffocation in these parts
will probably result in a verdict that the
deceased hadn’t room to breathe owing to
foreign experts. At present there are on
hand the Cockburn Sound Harbor expert,
the Port Phillip Harbor expert, the wireless
expert, the Federal capital expert, and some
others, all imported and all expensive. Also,
Sydney has just lost the imported traffic ex-
pert, who, at great cost, recommended a
bridge, across the harbor (Minister Griffith
put his foot on that) and a city railway
(the Upper House threw out that). In any
case there is no money for either of these
works, but the money to pay the expert was
found all right
ECLIPSED.
The one discordant note in the chorus of patriot-
ism which welcomed the arrival of Australia’s new
navy was raised in Melbourne, where the Age could
not let even such an occasion pass without a jealous
provincial jeer at Sydney... .Victorian provincialism
....This splenetic incoherence. .. .We think every
self-respecting Australian will regard this paltry
provincial snarl at such a time as something to be
heartily ashamed of. — Sydney Daily Telegraph
(justly and wrathfully).
THE MUFFLED VOICE : “ Oh, you—you haw.
ful woman! You
nashnal disgrace!
An' you borrered
me own broom an'
bucket t' do it
with!”
From a man in the West:—
There is only one explanation of Joe Cook’s con-
duct over the Cockburn Sound Naval Base, and that
is that John Forrest’s leg has been pulled tby old
'Groper mates of his who have axes to grind.' 1 The
Sound is about seven miles from Fremantle; and
people owning property at the latter place foresee a
wholesale shift of population and trade to the new
anchorage. They, therefore, want to see the base
constructed somewhere well out of reach—any old
place will do as long as it isn’t near Fremantle.
Nobody seriously believes- that Bigjohn is in with
the gang of buccaneers; - but that gang knew well
enough the old fellow’s prejudice against the Labor
party, and his readiness to snort at Cockburn Sound,
or almost anything . else that the Fisher crowd had
started.
“If properly administered the Federal
capital will not cost a farthing,” says Prime
Minister Cook. In other words, the in-
creased land values created by the building
of a publicly-owned city, even if it is a
mere administrative inland city, without
coal or water power or commerce or manu-
factures, will pay for the building of the
place. If that is so, how many dozens of
millions could be made out of nothing by
the building of great publicly-owned com-
mercial and manufacturing centres at places
like Port Stephens and Jervis Bay and Two-
fold Bay?
The latest performance of the Westralian
Assembly makes the spreading bank director
look rather foolish. For many affluent years
a local bank has cheerfully interfered with
the liberty of the individual by prohibiting,
on pain of dismissal, the marriage of any
employee getting less than £2OO per annum.
It is a hallowed old banking practice, and
no one thought of questioning its respecta-
bility until quite lately. Now the sacred
right has been taken from the Westralian in-
stitution, and by a most unpleasant means,
i.e., the addition of a clause to the Criminal
Code Bill. The penalty provided for any
breach is a fine of £5OO, or three months’ im-
prisonment. The bank director everywhere
is probably wildly astonished to find one of
his oldest privileges graded by modern legis-
lation as a vicious practice deserving of fine
or imprisonment. He has been captain of
the other fellow’s soul, and master of his ser-
vant’s fate for so long that any honest read-
justment of the kind must shake him to the
depths of his waistcoat. Probably when his
waistcoat has refixed itself he will get square
by “promoting” the married junior clerk to
the branch nearest the rabbit-proof fence on
the S.A. border.
QUESTION TIME.
LITTLE BOY : “ Where's Mount Kembla?”
"M'ot's a ’ero?” " Oo saved ’oo ?”
George Reid has come back to Australia
for a holiday. For years he has been ex-
plaining to the British people that the
Federal Labor Government, which he bit-
terly opposed, was a first-class Government.
He has been expounding that, under Protec-
tion, which he always, in his political days,
denounced as ruinous, Australia was boom-
ing as it had never boomed before. And
he has dearly demonstrated that Federa-
tion, which he used to call a partnership of
one sober man and five drunkards, was doing
really well. Also, he has been handsomely
paid for all this.
The prophetic soul of our uncle is
alleged to have decided that he can’t
underwrite any more loans at present
—unless, of course, he gets better
terms, which will probably mean 5
per cent. Of late more and more of the
new loan has been left on uncle’s hands, to
be peddled off to the community by instal-
ments at the best profit obtainable. But the
loans have become harder to peddle, and the
last Maoriland one won’t peddle at all save
at a loss. So uncle’s money is temporarily
locked up and he is mad. Nobody is madder
than our father’s brother when he has in-
advertently buried his cash in an almost
inconvertible per cent, security, and has
to sit down and see the chariot of commission
rolling by with another uncle on the box
seat.
Somebody—either the big wheat-buying
coterie or Tom Johnson—is having a pretty
game with the poor cocky just now. New
season’s wheat, delivery " unspecified, was
lately quoted in Sydney at 3s. 4d. per bushel,
but for January-February delivery (which,
of course, the cocky-grower is mostly afraid
to guarantee) 3s. 6£d. was at the same time
offered. In other words, there is so much
doubt about Johnson’s trains being able to
do the job they are supposed to do. that the
farmer who thinks he can get trucks within
two months of the harvesting is offered a
bonus of 2ld. per bushel for his pluck—or, it
may be, his simple, bucolic faith.
A CURTAIN LECTURE.
A daily paper deprecates the holding of an Imperial
Naval Conference in London at present, and urges
the Prime Minister to face with courage the diffi-
culties that lie ahead.
THE OLD LADY (in disgust): “ Yes, Joe
Cook, heverybody's remarkin' 'ow that habit
o' side-steppin's growin on yer—wot with
gettin' people to do yer Tariff, an' yer
Capital, an' yer Naval 'Arbors, and so on.
For ’Eaven's sake, it y'ave any man'ood
left, get ahead with our ships YOURSELF,
and stop leanin' on th' ole man fer a
while.”
This is the Government record during the
N.S.W. session which banged its way to an
untidy close last week :
Bills passed . . . . . . 22
Financial Statement . . . . . . None.
Bills rejected by Assembly . . . . 2
Bills rejected by Uppish House . . . . 6
Bills “deferred” by ditto . . . . 10

A recent complaint in Melb. Age draws
pointed attention to the fact that 90 per
cent, of Victoria’s wages boards apply solely
to either manufacturing or inherently Aus-
tralian industries. It is quite otherwise
with the various importing businesses;
which is why softgoodsmen offer able-bodied
males of 25 to 30, with from eight to 12
years’ experience, such pittances as 255.,
275. 6d. and £2 a week. Of course it is the
miserable softgoods hand’s own fault, but
that is no reason why Parliament should
sanction the unfair discrimination. When
is the Australian manufacturer to get suffi-
ciently high Protective duties to recoup him
for the decent wages the boards compel him
to pay, while his importing competitors pay
strictly indecent wages?
The Bulletin’s old friends, the estimable
Quakers, have been holding an inter-State
conference in Adelaide, and of course de-
clare the Defence Act to be ‘‘a glaring en-
croachment on the civil and religious free-
dom of the people” :
The interests of the nation lie in the cultivation
of practical relations with all the other peoples of
the earth; in the education of the young in the
highest ideals of the superiority of moral to physical
force; and in the conservation of national wealth by
strict limitation of expenditure on non-productive
ends.
All of which is true; wherefore let the
Quaker merchant ciltivate practical rela-
tions with B. Sikes instead of putting bolts
to his windows and bars to his doors, and
let him beat his steel safe into ploughshares.
Bolts and bars and steel safes are all non-
productive ; and B. Sikes is on the premises,
so to speak and can be argued with in our
own language. Meanwhile compulsory taxa-
tion to pay the bobby’s wages is, of course,
a glaring encroachment on the civil and
religious freedom of the people.
One gets rather weary of the gag of Ben-
nett, M.P. for Gippsland, about the enor-
mous number of fictitious names put on the
rolls by ‘‘The Fisher Government.” For
incredibility it ranks with the sort of yarn
that the worshipful Grand Liar of a sub-
urban Orange Lodge retails on the subject
of Rome. To put the matter on the lowest
possible basis: How could any Government
possibly cause 80,000 supposititious names to
be put on the electoral rolls of any Aus-
tralian State without being caught. The
enterprise would have called for such an
army of agents that all its details would
have become public property within a week.
Yet such is the populace’s infinite capacity
for being gulled that Bennett’s absurd story
is quite likely to make useful electioneering
matter.
Prime Minister Cook has set forth that,
unless Parliament gets through more work,
“he will be ashamed to accept his salary.”
It_ is a pity Cook isn’t a barrister. In the
Middle Ages the English barrister was sup-
posed to be ashamed to accept coarse, worldly
remuneration, so he wore a pocket at the
back of his petticoat, and, while he was
eloquently pleading the case of the mediaeval
horse-thief, the solicitor’s clerk, in his jerkin
and knee-breeches, crawled up and dropped
the cash into this receptacle. Later, the
barrister tried to get round to the back of
himself to see how much he had collected.
In course of time, however, he realised that
it was better to have his fee in front of him,
so he sewed up the rear pocket,-, and it became
a sort of flap or sinecure. But the old idea
might be revived. Joseph Cook might wear a
tail coat, and, when he is in the midst of
impassioned- oratory, his admiring follower
John Forrest might come up behind him on
all-fours, and, silently and unbeknownst, de-
posit about £2OO in silver —being a month’s
pay—in Joe’s clothes. How Bigjohn would
look, approaching silently on all-fours,
with that quantity of coin, this paper isn’t
sure, but it fancies he would present some
resemblance to an elephant in a state of
great applause. Anyhow, nobody would
know that Joe had been paid save by his
sudden bobbing down and sagging at the
knees.
There is likely to be trouble
in the Home Affairs D e Zrt
ment if Willy Kelly remains
long at the steering wheel. The
mwah person, although a mem-
ber of the Ministry which
blithers about the iniquity of a
“gagged” press, permits such a
rigorous censorship to be exer-
cised over information supplied
to the press that some of the
permanent heads are alleged to
be pushed into a false position
For instance, the Cook crowd
has persistently alleged that the
rolls at the last election were
inflated to a brazen extent
Figures published by Statis-
tician Ivnibbs in regard to the
adult population would appear
to bear out this allegation; but
officers of the Electoral Depart-
ment declare that there is nothing very
wrong with the rolls. The apparent
disparity between Knibbs’s figures as
to the population and electoral officer
Oldham’s as to the rolls is said to
be easily explainable; but when the
newspapers attempted to have a word with
Oldham on the subject they were
shooed off, no doubt because if the truth
were known a number of prominent “Lib-
eral” windbags would be associated in the
public mind with the late Tichborne Claim-
ant.
Opposition-leader Wade of N.S.W. has
published his policy speech at Chatswood.
Very little has been said about it. You
can’t hit a cloud with an axe and produce
any result that is worth mentioning. Wade’s
oration is the cloud and criticism is the axe.
After fruitlessly rushing to and fro upon
the various N.S.W. electorates, for a con-
siderable time, N. S. Wales’s political
dragon, Wood, has been laid at last. St.
George got him last week.
When the report came along that the
London underwriters who float our loans
had been struck so badly that they might
have to leave off work for a while, a Sydney
daily remarked that this would be awkward
for N.S.W., which required to raise a loan
every two or three months. That compositor
ought to be sacked. Of course the editor
wrote “every two or three minutes.”
Millen’s Scottish regiments in the Aus-
tralian army are to consist of “the most suit-
able” cadets. “The remainder will then be
compelled to associate themselves with the
other branches of the citizen forces in the
ordinary way.” The Scottish regiments get
the pick of the bunch; the poor Scotch
samples go into the inferior Australian
regiments. Here is the basis of an insol-
ent cackle of superiority, since brither
Scots will be able to congratulate them-
selves on their own braw. bonnie laddies as
compared with poor Australian weeds named
MacDougal.
THE HERALD OF DAWN.
To realise the part that the daily press plays in
human affairs it is only necessary to imagine the
position of any country in which the publication of
newspapers was to suddenly cease. —Daily paper.
ANGEL OF LIGHT: "But s'posin’, young man,
if I left off?"
VICTIM OF SKITE : "Ah, if you only would
for a little while—just for a change!"
The ideal M.P. is dreamed of iu M. P•
Shiel’s new romance, “The Dragon.” He
is to be paid £3OOO a year, when caught;
hut he will take some catching, for he must
be (1) “a workman, having educated hands
and eyes, personally acquainted with Hod”;
(2) not bald or toothless: (3) a Doctor of
Science.” And he might have all those
qualifications, and still be a rotten bad judge
of a railway route.
Encouraging evidence by George Edwards,
secretary of the Agricultural Laborers
Union, England :
In nine cases out of ten the woman starves; the
first thing she thinks about is her children and hus-
band. As a result of this chronic underfeeding, we
have a very large percentage of insanity amongst the
women. I am on the asylums committee of tlje
Norfolk County Council, and we have over 300 wive*
of the laboring classes under our care. I attribute
this large number to the anxiety necessitated in
making ends meet and to the poor food.
Good old Free Breakfast-table!
THE AUTOMATON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This time the House voted on non-party lines, and
some curious things occurred.— Press item.
The word passed round the Talking Shop
Before the House divided:
“For once let party shackles drop
And principle decide it;
For once forget the party plan,
And vote your own way—if you can.”
When legislator Blinker heard,
He shook his head and wondered ;
It seemed a bidding quite absurd,
He felt the Whips had blundered.
He’d voted nigh on twenty year
As others bade who bossed him here.
He’d voted black was white or grey
Long time without a scruple ;
He’d voted then the other way,
And turned his coat quadruple;
He’d moved, as place was sold or bought,
A pawn of party, minus thought.
And now “to vote as Conscience bade”—
Were these the words they uttered
To him, poor wretch, who only weighed
Which side his bread was buttered ?
A stock, a stone —distraught he stood,
And tried to think the best he could.
Again he tried ; but, ah ! too well
The party mill had ground him.
He felt that cursed division bell
With jinglings quite confound him.
“ 'l’d use my mind,” he muttered, “now;
But, Lord I I’ve quite forgotten how!”

NOTIONS
1 he Caulfield Cup result settled all doubts
Te the relative values of Sydney and Melbourne
torin. Auriter, placed third in the Metropolitan,
length® behind the winner, was good enough to beat
the better of Connolly’s vaunted pair, and for ihe
nmth time in the last 10 years the Caulfield Cup
put the local trainers out of conceit with their “good
things.” Run in record time—2min. 34sec. —it was,
seemingly, a satisfactory go, except for an ugly
bump that befell Mountain Princess. The race was
practically confined to the horses that looked most
dangerous on paper. The five favorites at the start,
all quoted at from 9 to 2 to 8 to 1, finished in the
first six. Wassail, the 25 to 1 chance that got
third place, was the only interloper among the
“morals.” Anna Carlovna ran a great race from
start to finish, being among the leading four all the
time; but Aurifer, .who wore the mare down from
the distance post, had never been far behind her. Of
the others that made bold shows Aleconner was the
first to fade away. Big Uncle Sam ran with more dash
and resolution than the luckless little Mountain
Princess ; nevertheless, last year’s winner compounded
rapidly after rounding the last turn—he is not the
horse he was, nor is he likely to recover his power
to make a fine run at the end of a Cup race. The
glory of Uncle Sam has departed, and only his will-
ing heart and raking stride remain. If he frets a
place in the Melbourne Cup this writer will be
surprised.
Six times in the last seven years one of the placed
horses in the Caulfield Cup has been placed again in
the Melbourne Cup. Poseidon won both events in
1906. Acrasia and Apologue won the two-mile handi-
cap after running second at Caulfield. Tulkeroo and
Flavian were second in both cases. Apple Pie scored
a second and third, and Uncle Sam finished first and
third. All the same, there is little chance of either
of the four placed horses in the Caulfield Cup coming
to the fore next Tuesday week at Flemington.
Aurifer. who is not very stoutly bred, will have
151 b. more to carry. Anna Carlovna is a Soult
(which suggests speed rather than staying power),
and she will have 51b. more at Flemington. Wassail,
the son of Malster, can stay better than most of his
relatives, but he will have 71b. more than his Caul-
field Cup weight. Probably the only Caulfield Cup
runner worth thinking of seriously for the Melbourne
Cup is Sea Prince, who may have been falsely
boomed, but is certainly a good stayer, with a ten-
dency to do his best at Flemington. Most horses
are happiest on their own training-ground, but Sea
Prince is an odd-tempered beast who hates the
place where he is required to gallop in the early
morning.
The field for the Melbourne Cup is not likely to
exceed a score, and not more than a dozen horses
have a visible chance of winning. A good 3-year-
old, with a first-class jockey to steer him would look
better worth backing than any of the older stagers;
but where is the youngster of proved merit?
A sporting tipster’s publication (price Is.) was
offered to punters on Caulfield Cup morning, and a
good many earnest believers coughed up their bob for
it. An extra-special item jn the precious budget of
latest news from the course was a list of “Non-
Runners To-Day.” Five “non-runners” were men-
tioned, including Avance, This annoying animal
put the oracle to confusion by starting' at 10 to 1
for the last race, and winning it.

The Parisian, who' won Melbourne Cup
two years ago with Bst. 9st. up, is some people's
dead bird for the coming- event. A few weeks ago
word went round the press that the aged gelding had
gone wrong again—about the tenth time in his long
career and would have to be stopped in his train-
ing. Then came the announcement that The Parisian
was working as before, and in due course he accepted
for the Caulfield Cup, .hut was said to be more seri-
ously intended for the'longer race at Flemington.
The Parisian’s Melbourne Cup victory is not very
brilliant in retrospective. He won in the most
masterful style, but the placed horses, Flavian and
Didus, were only plodders. It was the Cup for
which Trafalgar started a hot favorite and ran un-
accountably ill.
* * * *
Backers of Banner, first horse home in a
small race at Morphettville (Adelaide) lately, had
reason to be thankful that the S.A.J.C. stewards
were in a good humor. His jockey had clearly
clipped over the head, with the whip, the only horse
threatening danger as the winning post was neared.
Protest was immediate and successful, and backers
of Rigoletto, the third, prepared to collect a dividend
for second. (The tote pays out three-fourths of the
money in hand to tickets on the winner, and one-
fourth to those on the second.) But the stewards
considered that the scrimmage was a matter between
the two taking part in it, and that the far-away
Rigoletto ought not to profit; so they took advantage
of a little-used rule which allows them to deprive a
winner of the stake, and place him second. That is
where Lanner was officially “placed” ultimately, and
his backers were so pleased at getting the useful divi-
dend of £3 13s. (for each £ invested) that they
forgot to worry over not getting three times as much.
* * * *
Frank Meyers, of Melbourne, the sporty
hosier and outfitter who was hardly dealt with in
the Blackpool case, got some satisfaction from his
appeal to the High Court. Meyers’s alleged offence
was his free and undisguised backing of another per-
son’s horse for a race at Moonee Valley, in which he
(Meyers) ran his own horse, Blackpool. He declared
that Blackpool was out to win (as far as his instruc-
tions could affect the matter), notwithstanding his
backing of the other man’s nag. It seems clear
enough that a more experienced owner’s explanation
would have been accepted as satisfactory, under simi-
lar circumstances, by the Moonee Valley Club stew-
ards. But Meyers, having recklessly created sus-
picion, didn’t go the right way to remove it. The
club disqualified owner, trainer, jockey and horse.
Meyers appealed to the V.R.C. committee, which
upheld the Moonee Valley verdict. Then he appealed to
a Vic. court, the Judge whereof appeared to know very-
little about the matter, and was content to confirm
the finding of the racing tribunals. Against this
decision Meyers appealed to the High Court on purelv
legal grounds, and the result was half a victory for
him. The High Court found that whereas the V.R.C.’s
committee covld disqualify Meyers for 12 months for
the “suspicious practices,” it could not expel him from
the V.R.C. Club. The club undoubtedly deserved to
be beaten on this point. The sporting case against
Meyers was not proven: what satisfied the racing
powers-that-be has not satisfied the shrewdest out-
side judges of the strange story ; and in rating him
as a citizen unfit to remain a member of their club,
the V.R.C. committee did him a gross injustice, all
things considered.
Although Sydney horses were streaming
southward during the previous week the 30,000
people who went out to City Tatt.’s meeting at
Kandwick on Saturday were rewarded with good
fields to gaze upon and lose money over. But for
once winners seemed somewhat easie'r to pick despite
that circumstance, and the favorites came home with
a persistence that must have brought woe to the
hearts of the Ten Lost Tribes. In the Hurdles Hall-
mark went out at 7 to 2 against, and won by a couple
of lengths. In the Flying Handicap 10 started, and
the public went for Malt Mary and La Fiancee at
9 to 2 against, with- lots of support for Sweet Malt
at fives. Sweet Malt won by a length and a quarter
from Sir Willie, which carried about as much public
money as the mare, and had the Tote been in use
would have paid a decent dividend. A field of eight
faced the barrier for the Novice Handicap, with Blue-
berry a lukewarm favorite at threes. Mordkin came
next at fours. When the numbers were hoisted
Blueberry was first by half a length from Mordkin.
In the Club Mile the public missed it by one. Border
King was- favorite at 7 to 4 against, while Elystan
went out at sixes. The latter romped home ahead of
the favorite by a length and a half —and, again, had
the Tote been running the backers of the favorite
would have got some of their money back if they
didn’t clear a profit. In the City Tatt.’s Handicap
Galbraith O’Cohen practically scored a skinner, the
winner, Posinatus, going out at eights, while N.S.W.
and Alured, the favorites, finished fifth and sixth
respectively. The last race, the Flying Welter, saw
Sweet Malt, despite a seven-pound penalty, made a
hot favorite with Lady Denman. They went out at
fives. Virginie, the imported mare, started at sixes.
Neither of the favorites had a hope, and Virginie
won by a length from Milfoil, who cut Oweenee
down by a head. Altogether, it was a mixed day, in
which the punters had the best of the first half and
the pencillers of the second —and racing is a game at
which ,he who laughs last laughs most numerously.
The arguments at Moonee Valley next
Saturday will bring out a number of Sydney horses
that missed the Caulfield meeting and are expected
to shine at Flemington, a few days later. Hallow-
mas and Cagou, for instance, are entered for the
Moonee Valley Cup. A victory for the latter would
add nothing to the 101 b. penalty already debited to
him for the Melbourne Cup. Willow Green and
Limelight, from the Ala State, are other possible
winners. If either of the penalised pair, Cagou or
Limelight, captures the chief event at the Valley, he
is bound to be a strong fancy for the two-mile race,
which now looks very likely to go to one of the little
lot of candidates from Sydney.

Allen Doone will not win renown by
breaking A. Turner’s automobile record run of 19hr.
2min. from Melbourne to Sydney. The N.S.W. police
will not even let him try. No further attempts on
inter-State records will be permitted, and drastic
steps are threatened should any motorist have the
temerity to attempt to get through on a record run.
The same edict, of course, knocks but the attempt
that was shortly to have been made on J. Bolger’s
23hr. 41min. motor-bike record between the two
cities; but it will in no way interfere with the
reliability tests that are being promoted for both
motor-bikes and cars at the end of the year.
APPROACHING DARKNESS.
How Jerry Jerome appeared to Tim Sullivan.
A five-minute corroboree ended in Sullivan
being despatched to oblivion.
ihe Petrol Consumption Test promoted by
the Automobile Club of Victoria on Saturday week
came to an unsatisfactory conclusion through a very
unexpected cause. Each contestant was supplied
with a gallon of petrol in a tin connected up to the
carburetter by a short length of indiarubber tubing.
Unfortunately petrol has a dissolving action on rub-
ber, and after a while many of the tubes began to
leak at an increasing rate, and the finish was so
eminently unsatisfactory that there is talk of run-
ning it over again. In future events of the kind
the wise motorist will connect up with a tube of soft
copper attached to tank and carburetter by means
of a rubber “push on.’’
The newly-revived Amateur Athletic
Association of South Aus. has held its first cham-
pionships. Knowing the curious local lack of public
interest in track races, which, sent the old A.A.A.
to sleep several years back, it included football
kicking, tug-of-war, squad-drill by ladies, wrestling
and boxing, and got a good crowd to the Adelaide
Oval. The open-air boxing was especially popular.
Some of the weight-lifting was announced to be
among the records, but the running was notable only
for a 15 3-ssec. hurdles by I. B. Pender. Generally
speaking, the short races were won by University
men, and the long by lately-arrived Britons of the
Y.M.C.A.
The Australian-rules football championship
of the Commonwealth was settled this year between
Fitzroy and Port Adelaide, respectively best of Vic.
and S.A. leagues. The match struck a blazing hot
day on Adelaide Oval. The visitors were short of
some good men ; also they took the game in a picnic
spirit, and did not train specially. Port Adelaide,
on the other hand, took it quite seriously, and the
result was .just what might be expected. After half-
time, there was only one side in it, and the Victorians
got beaten by the staggering total of 13 goals 16
behinds to 4 goals 7 behinds.
Never was a more glorious, day than
Saturday afternoon in Sydney, when the Third Round
of First Grade crick'd opened with a bln-m of t-imv-
phant batting. No less than four centuries glittered
on the scoring board, and made haloes of glory
round the heads of Callaway, of Paddington, who
carried his bat for 137, while his clubmate Dwyer
did the same with 107 ; Cranney, of Central Cumber-
land, who lifted 133 before Pratten caught him off
Docker; and Dr. Hordern, of North Sydney, who
bashed 116 ere he fell to Buckle off Cullen. Sayle,
of Paddington, also did well, hitting up 91; so did
Goddard, of ltedfern ; and Radclitfe, of Bal-
main wrote 88 on the board before he re-
tired to the shades. After these demigods
came a long string of mighty ones too
numerous to mention. But consider the scoring:
North Sydney made 315 against Glebe for the loss
of nine wickets; and Central Cumberland (Parra-
matta) 317 against Western Suburbs. But the
maynum opus of the afternoon was Paddington’s
amazing score of 357 against Middle Harbor, for the
loss of only two wickets. Redfern smacked 308 off
Sydney, which replied with 13 for two. Waverley
was content with 264 from Petersham, which lost one
for 14. Balmain battered Gordon for 247, and Gor-
don started well with 51 without losing a stick.
Among the bowlers the heroes were Toby, of Sydney,
who took six Redfern wickets for 62 ; Andrews, of
Petersham, with six Waverley wickets for 82 ; Docker,
of Western Suburbs, who helped to keep Central
Cumberland’s already terrific score from climbing
higher with five for 29; and Bowden, of Gordon,
with five Balmain sticks for 101.

One of the quaintest curiosities of sport-
ing literature was published in the Melbourne dailies.
last week:—
“Wrestling Championship : Weber v. Wasem.—
Notice is hereby given that unless Oscar Wasem com-
municates with his manager, William Maynard, before
noon on Wednesday next, the match will be declared
off, and P. William Maynard will arrange to wrestle
Weber in his stead.”
Never before has a lost, stolen or strayed champion
in any branch of sport been desired to communicate
with a sorrowing “manager.” Maynard, it seems,
gave a guarantee for the appearance of Wasem, a
gentleman from America, by a certain date, but has
lost the run of him. And now, rather than let his
£25 be wasted, Maynard is going to do the wrastling
himself.

The Law is a one-eyed sport when it comes
to cru,elty to animals and birds. In a Sydney police
court last week two parishioners were fined £lO
between them for attending a cockfight in one of the
suburbs. Meanwhile, the pigeon murderer was either
blowing his prey to smithereens as they rose from
adjacent traps, or wounding them so that they crept
into shelter to die of hunger and wounds; and
special trains were available to jowled citizens whose
excitement lies in watching a hare burst its heart in
the race against a herd of tripehounds.
The last week in August, English crowds
were in a frenzy for the football which they had
been deprived of for nearly four months. Play before
September 1 is barred by the association; but the
teams had to practise, and at Chelsea a 15,000
crowd paid to see its pet club do it. The despotic
association will not allow a club to take the money;
so local charities do well out of this practice work.
The struggle between Jim Paddon and
Dick Arnst, the seeker for the sculling championship
of Australia, the Referee Challenge Cup, and £2OO
aside, on November 1, promises to be very strenuous.
Both giants have handed in the final slice of the
boodle to the stake-holder. Arnst gives notice that
if he can overthrow his brother Colossus and get
away with his lucre, the scalp of Barry will be the
next treasure he will seek.
Jim Sullivan, ex-middleweight champion
of England, on Saturday night securely buried his
greatness in the same Australian graveyard where the
splendors of Tahmmy Burns and Bill Squires repose.
Sydney Stadium was a fatal field for him. When he
met Midwood, of Tasmania, shortly after his arrival
in this country he showed excellent form and great
skill, and vast things were expected of him. His
trouble is nervousness, and it was generally under-
stood that he would not be seen at his best till after
the third round. Then he was liable to blaze forth
like the ship Volturno. So when he entered the
lists with Pat Bradley there was a large section
which was quite confident that it would see the hard
hitter outboxed and outgeneralled. But Bradley is
a more skilful scrapper than most people give him
credit for, and inside 90 seconds Sullivan was wood-
ened, and dazedly trying to climb to his feet by the
aid of the ropes. Then a fight was arranged for him
in Melbourne, at which it was expected he would
redeem his pennon—-and on the night of'the fight
he failed to turn up. However, his explanation of
that curious happening was accepted by promoter
Baker, and he was pitted against Jeremiah Jerome,
a Prophet among his own people. On paper his
chance against Jerome was nil. That hefty black
was in a fair way to beat Bradley (although out
of condition) when his hand broke—the Bradley
who had chased Sullivan across the Jordan inside
90 seconds. But nothing is so uncertain as boxing
form. Sullivan, when he entered the ring on Satur-
day night, seemed to be slightly nervous, but his
trepidation disappeared when the gong gave the
sound for battle. Jerome advanced with his drunken-
looking crouch, and swung several terrific but pain-
fully slow swings, which would have broken Sullivan
in two had they landed. Apparently Jerry didn’t ex-
nect them to land —it was merely his idea of a pre-
liminary. Then he gave an excellent burlesque of
Sid Stagg, faced Sullivan with his shoulder, and hit
round himself, so to speak. Jeremiah is a deceptive
brother? and he seemed as fat as a roly-poly. The
31b. (and more) bv which he exceeded Sullivan’s
list. 101 b. were assuredly all fat and not much use
to him. From which it was argued that the author
of the Book of Lamentations would let go his hurri-
cane act early in the fray, while his strength was
good. He was certainly more aggressive in his first
round with Sullivan than ever before in the same
ring. But Sullivan easily dodged his wild, wide
swings, and, standing in close, balked the attacks and
punished the Prophet severely about the head. Sulli-
van started the second round aggressively. Any ner-
vousness he might have suffered from at the begin-
ning had entirely disappeared, and he went in and
mixed in rare style to thunders of applause. The
Scriptural writer seemed to bend to the storm, but
he was only gathering purchase for the blizzard he
was about to turn himself into. A right and left
swing flashed through the light and sent Sullivan
staggering back towards the ropes. Jerome leaped
after him, and met a left stab tha,t checked him for
the fragment of a second. Then a hurricane of
blows swept down on Sullivan, who still .backed
away. A right swing caught him somewhere around
the place where he keeps his dinner, and then a
black mass waved in the air like a globular raven,
and descended. It was Jerome’s mighty left, and it
arrived on Sullivan’s point. Sullivan' spun round,
his eyes closed, and he assumed a loud, recumbent
or horizontal posture. The noise of his fall sounded
like Holman failing to float a loan. Referee Scott
went through the usual enumeration, and Sullivan’s
career in Australia ended. /
Last week the average fight-fan stood and
gaped speechlessly when some pal imparted the as-
tounding news that Owen Moran had “done a bunk,”
Then there was a wild rush for drinks and the ques-
tion of “why?” was debated at great length. Pal
Brown’s showing against Mehegan so impressed Reg
Baker that he gave the American bush boy a gold
medal and straightway tried to match him with Owen
Moran. Owen expressed himself as delighted u
assured Baker that there was no one in the n
more worthy his wallop than the handsome Yank,
youth ; but that day he had a bad hand and a! '
always liked to write a nice signature to his arttu
he would postpone the signing till a future dal
On Saturday Owen Moran was found on board A
Sonoma by a pug scribe, who said, “VVothel'” y
body at the Stadium knew that Moran was coin
He was stealing away very softly. Pressed for a r
son he explained that first, it did not pay him t
fight in this country ; and secondly, he was not
fled with the decision in his fight with Wells <>*
course, the best way to have proved that decision
wrong was to have stayed and knocked Wells oui ut
Melbourne in the return fight. But Owen didn’t
it that way. Anyhow, it was a foolish thing to sneal
away as he did. Thousands will remember him as 1
man who squibbed a fight with a boy who looks lik»
a coming champion. Which is not a nice impression
to leave behind.
On November 1 Johnny Summers meets
the elusive Harry Stone. Stone is in the same class
as Wells as an elusive fighter, and Summers will
have a life’s job to catch him. What will happen
when he does only the Lord knows. Summers be-
lieves that if he can catch Stone, Stone will promptlv
retire to the poppy fields. There are others who be
lieve that when Summers achieves that feat he will be
in the position of the man who caught
the tiger by the tail, whereupon he had a
problem on hand, as it was impossible to
hold on for ever and dangerous to let g 0
until the tiger became broken down through old age
Anyhow, it will be a great fight, and there is just
the chance that the section which would dearly love
to see Johnny get the father of a hiding mav havp
its wish gratified.

Sydney Stadium should see a tall struggle
next Saturday night when the long-delayed battle
between Pat Bradley and Dave Smith tears the atmo-
sphere. Both men have been training very hard for
each has a mighty respect for the other, and is leav-
ing nothing undone by which an ounce of advantage
may be gained. A recent visit by the scribes to
Bradley s camp disclosed the fact that he was a
mightily improved man. He has increased his speed
of movement and his speed of hitting, and Smith will
face quite a different man from the Bradley he has
seen coruscating in the ring in days-a-rear. On the
other hand, Smith has taken special care in his pre-
parations, and has as sparring partner Gordon
Coghill, with whom every sparring bout has been a
veritable battle. So there should be some things
doing on Saturday night.
* * * *
Little Waldemar Holberg, the plucky
Dane who made such a tremendous stand against the
formidable Hughie Mehegan at his first showing in
Sydney, has had bad luck in Australia. And on
Saturday night he got some more of it. He met
Hock Keys at the Baker Stadium in Brisbane, and
after 20 energetic rounds lost the verdict. It seems
to have been Wells and Mehegan over again, Holberg
chasing the elusive one round the ring, forcing the
fight always, and always unable to inflict any real
damage. When referee Marre placed his hand on the
head of Hock Keys there were wild expressions of
amazement and dissent. As writer did not see the
fight he abstains from any opinion on the matter.
But Holberg is an unlucky fighter.
Another White Hope has gone to the
woods in the person of A 1 Palzer, of Yankeelanrl.
This promising scrapper was knocked out, sent to
sleep, and otherwise disposed of by a wight scrapping
under the name of Dan Dailey, in the second chapter
of a six-round scrap at Newcastle, Pennsylvania.
The disaster was the result of a left hook to the jaw,
and is of the sort that in Yankeedom kills a man for
ever. The Yanks have no time for beaten boxers.

The Continental Rubber Co. has taken
over the control of the Inter-State Motor-Cycle Relia-
bility Test, previously under the management of the
N.S.W. and Victorian clubs. Last year 27 riders
faced the starter, of whom 15 battled through with-
out losing a point between Melbourne and Sydney—
a fact which suggested that the conditions were not
sufficiently strenuous. The Continental Co. accord-
ingly this year puts the competitors up against a
much stiffer proposition. It has donated £lOO for
prizes. The first is a motor-cycle valued at £65:
but unless there is an outright winner it will not
be given, and, instead, each successful rider will re
ceive a gold medal, and the “Continental Cup,’’ valued
at £2O, will go to the rider losing the least number
of points in the separate comnetitions which will
make up the test—to wit, Flexibility Hill Climb (first
day), Hill Climb (second day), Non-Stop Run (fourth
day). Should there be a tie —that is, more than one
competitor losing an equal number of points—the one
who wins the Hill Climb at Jugiong (second day)
will take the Cup. Entry forms and particulars can
be obtained from any of the Continental depots or
the secretaries of the N.S.W. and Victorian clubs.
Entries close December 10. i Competitors must have
been successfully' vaccinated?

Last week Prime Minister Cook and
Treasurer Forrest did the rounds of
the All Australian Exhibition in Mel-
bourne, and professed themselves de-
lighted with the array of locally manufac-
tured goods. Cook spoke of feeling particu-
larly interested in the wonderful productions
from beautiful Australian woods, which re-
vealed tne skill and industrial attainments of
workmen and manufacturers. John Forrest
stated that he was eye-opened and strength-
ened in his moderate Protection principles by
the exhibits, and had pinned his faith to
the idea of an inter-State Commission and a
“scientific tariff—not a revenue tariff.”
Also, the Minister of Customs talked mildly
of the encouragement due to Australian
manufactures. But no member of the Com-
monwealth Government hinted at the neces-
sity for prompt amendment of the tariff on
High Protection lines. Some time in the
dim future the Commission will submit to
the House a few proposals of “scientific”
tariff reform, and the House, presumably,
will adopt them if they are sufficiently hazy
in character, and assuming that business is
not entirely suspended owing to a want of
confidence motion. A whole-hearted Protec-
tionist Government seems impossible as long
as the Commonwealth Legislature is a battle-
ground of parties, and both parties are
partly composed of Foreign-traders. The
Inter-State Commission will do something
more towards protecting the Australian
worker, but neither the Cook Liberal party
nor the Fisher Labor party will want it to
do much.

ON THE HOP!
A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the. whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Private Enterprise, with lots of “cheap”
colored labor to help it, got two more advts.
from the Northern Territory last week. The
Government veterinary inspector remarked
that horse-breeding was carried on just any-
how—“mares and stallions are turned out
into the bush and the sires share chances
with the brumby horses.” And Gilruth, the
Administrator, in his report, said that,
though new people have been constantly
arriving, “none of the hotels have made an
attempt to extend their accommodation,
though they have not failed to raise their
tariff.” The veterinary inspector doesn’t
know what to do with the brumby problem,
but Gilruth suggests a State pub as the
onlv answer to his.
The Bulletin’s Stipendiary Pharisee
puts up a good case:—
The Vic. Council of Churches is turning its eves
Heavenward and saying, “O Lord, what did I tell
you?'’ The holiest and most righteous opponents of
the Baby Bonus have scored a point in the recent
Melb. prosecutions of unregistered baby-adopters.
Last year the C. of C. lodged objections to the bonus
on more than one ground, though its first protest, of
course, was against the iniquity of putting “legiti-
mate” and “illegitimate” mothers on the same level,
and thereby belittling the “sacredness of the mar-
riage tie.” The Pharisee spoke in the first protest,
but the solemn, shrewd suspicious man of business
(and every good Pharisee is that) had his say in the
objection to the Government giving £5 to non-
licensed mothers without providing “nroper safe-
guards to secure that the money would be rightly
applied.”
Now the staunchest champion of the bonus must
admit that it is not rightly applied when passed on
by the young mother to another woman who under-
takes the adoption of infants, at £ 5 a head, and
who is, seemingly, called a baby-farmer because she
prepares sucklings for the sickle. In one of the cases
lately published the adoption fee was only £2, but
the baby died all the same, and the Government
cannot be said to have got good value for its money.
The Council of Churches is well within its pious
rights in deploring the fact that no proper safe-
guards were taken to secure that the fivers should
be expended in the Commonwealth’s best interests
as regards those babies.
It only remains for the pastors and elders of the
Council aforesaid to say exactly what the Federal
Government can do to regulate the actions of bonus
winners. “Proper safeguards” are so much easier
to mention than to define. All bonus-givers, from
the fond father who tips bis irresponsible offspring,
to the music-loving suburban matron who always
bestows a Christmas-box on the German band, would
like to ensure a “rightful application” of the cash
grant, but they can’t prevent it from going wrong.
And a Government is not in a position to direct the
course of the £5 which is paid to Flossie Flightv
when her little indiscretion has been duly registered.
It can only pay the money and hope for good re-
sults. “Proper safeguards” are as impossible with
maternity bonuses as with old age pensions, which,
in a small percentage of cases, serve mainly to
hasten the pensioner’s decease owing to drink. The
Commonwealth cannot assume a trusteeshio of the
money it pays to a mother (married or otherwise),
or a guardianship of her child.
All things considered, it seems likely that the
Council of Churches will have to go on protesting
against the awful lack of class distinction in the
maternity bonus system. But if this intenselv moral
organisation cares to pray for a large, easy and
accessible foundling hospital, where the Government
will adont any infant on forfeiture of its lawful
bonus, The Bulletin will gladly join in the suppli-
cation.
St. James’s Old Cathedral is being moved
right out of the way, a mile off, to the top
end of King-street (Melb.). So every ves-
tige of church will leave this holy, conse-
crated site, and there will be another acre for
the warehouses, such as those which
already bring in probably £9000 a
year. If the Church does not want
this land for the sacred purposes
for which it was granted, it should go back
to the State. Supposing a man borrowed
a church building on the plea that he was
going to use it for a Band of Hope meeting,
and then turned it into a wine-bar, what sort
o" row would the Church make about it, even
if the man did plead that the profits were
to be used to buy w 7 oollen socks for the
heathen ?
“Bramble Beef” : Torres Pilot Captain
Jack Iiossiter urns so well known and well
beloved along 7000 miles of the Australian
coast that when he died a few score of the
hundreds who thereby lost a friend— the
few who were handiest to Torres Strait—
put up money for the fine monument over
his bones at Thursday Island. But they
understood he was to be buried at Matopo,
the highest hill beyond the town, and they’ll
be troubled to know that Captain Jack is
buried in a gully among the yellow aliens
and the niggers. It doesn’t matter to Cap-
tain Jack; but most men capable of big
friendships are sentimentalists, and. it hurts
the feelings of the friends to see a white
man put among the where he never
was when he was in life, and where he
wouldn’t stay now if he could make his way
out. Those of his friends who are in the
Straits are asking for an exhumation and a
removal of the monument and its subject to
Matopo, where all the Big White Chiefs are.
Glenelg, Adelaide’s front-door watering-
place, is rampant once more about its rail-
ways. The trouble began 30 years ago, when
Private Enterprise was strong or wily
enough to get authority to build two com-
peting lines of rail from the city, running
only a quarter of a mile apart. Of course
they soon had to amalgamate, and presently
the State bought them and paid for the old
foolishness. The trouble is that one runs
into the congested North Terrace station in
Adelaide, while the other finishes at both
ends dow r n the middle of a street. If it
ceases that absurd practice, it cannot get
to the Glenelg jetty, or to the middle of
Adelaide. There is a fresh scheme about
every six months for abandoning each line
—or one-half or two-thirds or five-ninths of
it—in favor of the other, and the Railways
Commissioner once pronounced in favor of
electrifying the lot, which doesn’t seem to
help the question either way. This month the
Glenelg corporation has suddenly elected to
run one line along the shore just above high-
water mark, thus cutting off the town from
its perfect beach; and the rest of Glenelg
is one wild shriek of protest, in which the
word “ Juggernaut” is the only thing
clearly audible.

“O’Phimerty”: The V.D.L. Co., which
holds so fat a slice of Tasmania, made one
costly mistake at the beginning. On the
original survey, the co.’s grant would have
included Mount Bischoff; but the wise heads
shook their grey tufts at “that barren hill,”
and got it exchanged for something more
fertile-looking. So the co. lost the most
profitable tin mine in the Southern Hemi-
sphere. Still one never can tell: had the
dreadful old loafer —the Very D- Lazy
Co. —hung on, quite likely the mine, even if
discovered, would never have been developed.
From Tiie Bulletin’s Master of Cere-
monies :—
Joe Cook is the first Australian Prime Minister
incapable of assuming that dignity which befits the
leading citizen of a continent. Barton, Dealcin,
Watson and Fisher looked and acted the part well;
and even Reid avoided doing anything outrageous
during his brief career as Prime Minister. But
Cook, an inexpensive humorist on the hustings, remains
an ill-mannered little person in the House. Office
has not sweetened his disposition or mitigated his
habit of snarling. True, he has almost ceased to
employ the word “tripe ' as a means of showing the
weakness of an opponent’s reasoning; but his latest
argument—to wit, “hogwash,” is not a bit more
convincing!
No less than 86 lawyers have, it is said,
signed a paper setting out that they would
he happier if Justice Edwards was off the
Maoriland Supreme Court Bench. This
makes an Australasian record. Efforts—
rare in these parts—to remove a Judge are
generally carried out on the quiet, and even
then no such number as 86 has ever before
been in the conspiracy. There is a statutory
way of shifting his Honor, but it is a tedious
and unlovely procedure, and has been
exercised but 'two or three times in Austral-
asia. Once it occurred in S. Australia ; and
in Victoria a formal requisition was sent in
against Judge Willis, who sat at Port Phillip
in 1842. He was cashiered; but that was
before Parliamentary Government.
“Lud” recalls an old scandal: —
The cablegrams keep worrying Australia with details
about the marriage of Prince Arthur of Connaught and
the Duchess of Fife. There must be a Providential
idea in this. I think it is to prompt me to say
something about poor Mrs. Jordan, ancestress of
the Duke of Fife, descended from her daughter,
Countess of Errol. William XV. and Mrs. Jordan
had ten children, the Fitzclarences. They were
magnificently provided for; yet after their mother
had lavished money on them, they meanly allowed
her to die in wretched poverty. The year 1813 wit-
nessed two theatrical events of importance. Ed-
mund Kean made his first appearance in Drury Lane
on January 26, and Mrs. Jordan made her last ap-
pearance there on June 1, acting Lady Teazle. Her
stage career ended, she went to St. Cloud (Paris)
and died there in July, 1816, under the assumed
name of Mrs. James, in poverty, obscurity and ex-
treme mental Suffering. Her grave became obliter-
ated, her effects were sold by auction. An English-
man who was present said “Shame ! Shame! Even
her personal wardrobe was sold, amid coarse gibes
and vulgar mockery.” The Archbishop of Canter-
bury, marrying King William to Princess Adelaide,
would of course say, “Such is the fate of sinners!”
—which is all very well, only William, the other
party, didn't die in poverty and obscurity; and
I’ll swear the Archbishop prayed that he might be
delivered from both.
“Y.” : I ran an often-misquoted old anec-
dote of Bench, Bar and Dock to its source
the other day, in the manuscript notebook of
Sydney’s District Court Judge Dowling, son
of the second Chief Justice of N. S. Wales.
This manuscript version reads substantially
thus. Cheeke was Crown Prosecutor. Cal-
laghan, not long arrived in Sydney, strutted
about the court with his first brief. “Ho,”
cried Cheeke, “I see you are briefed, Cal-
laghan. Who’s the victim?” Callaghan deliv-
ered the name. “But,” said Cheeke, “I’ve just
finished the information, and do not intend
to file a bill against him.” “Now, now,”
pleaded Callaghan, “and this my first case !
Do file a bill, and I’ll have the honor and
glory of getting him free.” Cheeke, a good
sport, yielded easily, and Callaghan waded
in in defence. But the jury brought the
prisoner in guilCy, and a heavy sentence was
imposed. People didn’t know what was
wrong with Callaghan for some days. He
appealed to the Judge and to the Govern-
ment, maintaining the prisoner’s innocence—
all ineffectively, till at last he and Cheeke
walked arm in arm to the Premier and
humbly confessed what their sportive little
conspiracy had brought about. The pris-
oner was thereupon released.
“The Pariah” is reproachful:—
Your hectic and immoral publication frequently
throws bricks at the enlightened advocate of prohibi-
tion ; but I rejoice to know that the modestly-
tinted Nineteenth Century, at any rate, is honest
enough to publish the facts about the success of pro-
hibition in Europe. The article containing them is
written by a lady who is, unlike your staff, suspected
of being entirely disinterested in beer.
With a party she was caught in a blizzard in a
prohibition district in Finland, and was unable to
obtain a very necessary “peg.” A few days later
she left this prohibition district by a coasting
steamer which traded to another sturdy prohibition
town. The stewardess brought her food—and a
bottle —and was openly amazed when the latter was
refused. This made the lady look round. “Most of
those who were there were there to drink spirits;
they had come for no other purpose,” she remarks.
In a prohibition hotel in Sweden she noticed that
the guests, after dining, went casually through a
door marked “No admittance,” and came out again
looking well pleased and innocent. Inside that door
was a well-stocked cupboard, and those who drank
did not pay ; but on each bill there was a curiously
constant and trifling error in addition.
In Christiana she ran out of methylated spirits
on a Saturday, and went to the chemist. He was
unable to sell the article after seven o’clock, he in-
formed her, and he jeered at her expressed reason
for needing it. Ladies always wanted it to burn,
never to drink, he assured the other customers. At
another shop where there were no customers she ob-
tained a “loan” of some methylated spirits. Any
sort of spirit may be “borrowed” during prohibited
hours.
In a Swedish province (prohibition) she saw quite
a lot of drinking. “In one village all the men, to-
gether with all their friends for miles around, were
drunk.” The occasion was “a religious ceremony.”
In Scandinavia the minimum quantity of spirit
that can be bought is 55 gallons. This does not put
spirit beyond the reach of the rural population. A
whole village, or maybe a group of two or three
villages, goes into partnership to raise the wind for
the 55 gallons, and “so long as there is a drop of
spirits left not a man has a thought in his head
beyond drinking.” In some villages a weekly col-
lection is taken to defray the cost of the spree.
Nowhere have so many Acts of Parliament been
passed with the object of keeping people sober as in
Scandinavia; yet “more persons in proportion to
the population are arrested for drunkenness in the
towns of Norway than in any other country.”
Though The Bulletin may refuse to publish the
truth about the glorious advance of prohibition in
Maoriland, it will, I hope, acknowledge that pro-
hibition is popular in Europe with all classes—even
the distillers.


The Battery
of Perfect Service.
The Edison Storage Battery is a big advance on all
others. Its dependability and long life are features
responsible for its adoption by most of the large
users of Batteries throughout the world.
It is faultless in construction—free from lead or
acid —being of iron and nickel in caustic potash.
For each pound of weight it gives an active service
which is twice the Watt output that a lead battery
is capable of giving in active service of only one
year.
We invite your inquiries. State purpose for which
vou need Storage Batteries, and we will promptly
supply all particulars.

The Royal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-trse, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given' in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from J. P. Talty, 388 Sussex Street, Sydney.

IN
BANANA LAND
The other day an eloquent street orator
informed the Brisbane P.M. that if he were
forced into prison he would certainly
“hunger-strike.” He went to gaol, all the
same ; but the smell of the first square meal
in the cell broke up the threatened “strike.”
About the time of this hero’s collapse, a
Courier reprint of 50 years ago told how a
certain James Donohue, a confinee in Bris-
bane Gaol, took it into his head to fast for
40 days, in imitation of the Saviour’s absten-
tion in the wilderness. Donohue carried it
out and ate absolutely nothinu’ for the period
mentioned, although he drank abundance of
water; but whether his mortification of the
flesh led to his abandoning a sinful life, as
he intended, history doesn’t tell, i
It seems that the North is able to de-
moralise even a bishop. Frodsham, return-
ing to England after a long and popular
service in Townsville and thereabouts, is
described by the Daily News as “a thinly
disguised pagan.” Certainly Frodsham is
an enthusiastic advocate of the National
Defence policy of Australia, and. the Daily
News is owned by the cocoa Cadburys. And
the fact that the cocoa Cadburys are
Quakers who were openly accused of get-
ting cheap cocoa by mighty cheap and en-
slaved nigger labor may account for the
compliment.
With the object of saving for the white
man what little is left of the pearling busi-
ness, Denham has introduced a Bill pro-
viding for licenses and a language test for
licensees. Whereupon, “in the cause of free-
dom and individual liberty,” Pat Leahy,
M.L.C., brother of the late Jan, denounced
the test as a plan for keeping certain brown
people out. Patsy’s ideas about “freedom
and individual liberty” evidently don’t run
beyond pearl-shelling. If anybody, brown or
white, had pushed behind the old Leahy bar
and demanded in the cause of freedom and
individual liberty the right to work the
Leahy beer-pump, Leahy would have tossed
him out, even though the intruder could have
argued the point in 17 languages. It was a
THE RETURN OF GEORGE REID.
Flattering reception given by the Comic Artists’ League of Australia.
terribly important thing to preserve the
Leahy beer-pump for Leahy, but to preserve
the Australian pearling grounds for Aus-
tralia is a matter of no consequence what-
e er.
The gloom of the last few Sabbath
evenings in Brisbane has been much relieved
by the doings of some International Social-
ist street orators of the cult. Police-czar
Cahill had refused them permission to speak
in the streets, whereupon they spoke about
nothing in particular without it, and were
promptly arrested. On the second Sunday,
one member, mistaking himself for a suff-
ragette, chained himself to a verandah-post
in the main street. Having thus made his
calling and location sure, he commenced to
address the crowd of 2000, and continued
his speech while Cahill’s minions liberated
the verandah-post with a chisel. When the
Police Estimates came before the House,
Swayne (Liberal) attacked Cahill and the
Home Secretary for suppressing Free
Preach, and for two days Parliament
wrangled on the question whether it was
Cahill that was obstructing Free Howl or
the Socialists that were obstructing traffic.
When all the members had talked them-
selves thirsty, the vote was passed, but the
kerbstone still isn’t sure whether it was
decided that Cahill was right or wrong. So
the Socialists continue to speak and be
arrested, and the heathen in his blindness
is enjoyin? himself better than he has done
of a Sunday evening for ages past.
The Threepenny Town.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A batch of a dozen roysterers fronted th n PM.
“This is a threepenny town, your Honor,” said the
sergeant by Way of explanation.— Maryborough paper.
Some fellows talk big about Paris and Rome,
Their churches and taverns, their ruins
and towers;
But why should they wander ’way over the
foam,
To ferret out towns that are fairer than
ours?
I’ll grant ’em a license to trot high and low,
To hobnob with black man and yellow and
brown,
But where will they find the quaint glamor
we know
That lies on the streets of the Threepenny
Town?
Our Threepenny Town! How I swell at
the name,
Recalling the jest and the quip and the
song,
The beer that began and that ended the
game,
The laughter that rose from the throats
of the throng ;
The stories we told of our own derring-do,
The liquor that bubbled and banished the
frown,
The yarns that we laughed at, though mouldy
and blue,
Away in a nook of the Threepenny Town !
In Threepenny Town, though your silver was
small,
And coppers were few and of credit you’d
none,
Y'ou joined in the bout when the talking was
tall,
And cheerfully drank till the coinage was
gone ;
And if, on the home-track, you wobbled a
bit,
And saw the moon wink as she slily looked
down,
And planets maliciously mock you and
flit —
It was frequently so in the Threepenny
Town.
And then there were visions of creepers and
things,
Of dragons that drew you down into the
grime,
Of demons that rose with a rustle of wings,
And crocodiles weeping in buckets of
slime :
And then there were ghouls that attended
your tracks
And showed you a hole where the Devil
could drown,
And offered you swivel-eyed serpents in
sacks,
At so much a bag-—in the Threepenny
Town.
And if, when you landed beside your own
door,
You dropped at the step in a swoon and a
dream.
And slept till the milkman broke in on your
snore,
With “Boss, ’ere’s the milk fer the whisky,
an’ cream.”
Whatever folk said there were none could
contest
A conscience at rest was existence’s crown,
And he who was slumb’ring had peace in his
breast,
Though stones were his pillow, in Three-
penny Town.
For one little coin you the portal could ope
That offered such innocent pleasures as
these,
That lifted your neck from the noose in the
rope.
And whistled old Care to the dogs and
the breeze;
No wonder we reckon your Paris a jest,
And London a fraud in a glittering gown—-
We know the old bite and the snap and the
zest
Of life that we lived in the Threepenny
Town.
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 18, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Governor and Lady Macgregor, Premier
Denham and his Premieress, and some
dozens of other notabilities clustered together
at the Junction Park State School this
afternoon, to officially open a new wing at
that academy of learning. The operation
was performed with the usual blowpipes.
After that the two medals for the recent
school essay on Australian manufactures,
both of which came to this seat of erudition,
were handed over to a bonny little Aus-
tralian miss and a nice-looking lad of about
12.
The same day the Gaud Mayor got into
his “pretties,” and, armed with a racquet,
bounded over a new tennis court as a vis-
ible and outward signal that it was ready
for St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church club.
The land, in Victoria Park, belongs to the
City Council, and was traded, on leasehold,
to the pious Tennisbyterians. Alderman
Hayes assisted his Gaudship in the formal
racquet; Dr. Merrington did the Cicero and
Demosthenes act; a team of ladies played
with the grace of the angels ; and an exhibi-
tion game was put through by Messrs. Thur-
low, Rattan, Exton and McLean.
On Wednesday night the Crfeche and
Kindergarten had a benefit evening at “The
Dandies.” Quite a crowd of our satraps
and grandees sat in the front seats. Premier-
ess Denham, Mr. and Mrs. Diddams and
several others of the committee brought per-
sonally-conducted parties to swell the funds.
The Wattle Day League held its annual
meeting on Wednesday night. His Ex. and
Lady Macgregor sat on part of the plat-
form, and various people sang at them. The
Head of the Clan gave an address, and
energetic ladies soothed the multitude with
coffee and sandwiches.
Archbishop Donaldson fed the Church
Congress workers at Bishopsbourne this
afternoon. The Bish. and de Witt Batty
(known in irreverent circles as the “Clerical
Pink ’Un”) are leaving for England some
time next month, and will be away for about
two-thirds of a year.
W. H. Ryder has moved out of his chair
in the Home Secretary’s Department, and
W. J. Gall has moved in. Gall is about 46,
is a Queenslander by birth, and has been
connected with the department he is now
in charge of since 1885. It was then the
Colonial Secretary’s outfit. In 1891 Mr.
Gall went to Barcaldine, where he was kept
for three months, looking after the accounts
in connection with the shearers’ strike.
Later on he joined the Auditor-General’s
staff, and during the Boer war had charge
of the bill relating to the Queensland farm-
burning show. All the hen-robtfing and
piano-smashing done by the Northerners
was reckoned up in his office, likewise the
Bible-stealing and the tearing up of the
little Boer girl’s copybook.
Dr. Elkington, who has left the State
Health Department to take up a position in
the Commonwealth service, was farewell ed
last week by a regretful staff, which pressed
on him an illuminated address and a crate
of sovereigns. Dr. Moore, a cheery person
who has been closely associated with Dr.
Elkington’s schemes for improving the public
health, has been appointed to the job.
Lieutenant Barry (one of the partners of
Barry and Roberts) and his ornamental
wife were welcomed home on Thursday night
by the employees of the firm. The returnees
have been tripping on the Continent of
Europe and in England, which is a small
island off the French coast, and have borne
up heftily against all climatic drawbacks
while absent from Australia.
A youthful scion of a well-known Queens-
land family recently went a-touring in Eng-
land, and while away he met an English
girl, of the pink-cheeked variety. In, less
than a fortnight the two found that life
would be a hollow sphere if the seas were
to roll between, so the usual half-hoop of
diamonds was clamped on as a pre-
liminary, and the young Returned home
to break the news to mother. Mamma’
verdict was favorable, passage e S2fJ
were forwarded, and the. girl duly a ?SS
and found awaiting her an impatient sw a ?n
a wedding breakfast, a band, a special train
for the guests and other expensive ami
sones. But, alas, for woman’s tren,.h
That English miss had no sooner set S
on Brisbane soil than she refused to car™
out her part of the bargain. The sea w,/
age had played the deuce with her y 0 „ n „
affections—as sea voyages often do— and
calmly announced her intention of weddin!
a man in Maonland. The most interest
part of the story is that the brisk maidS
wired to the wild colonial boy from Mpi
bourne and Sydney for more money, which
he obligingly sent. He is only about £lOO
out of pocket.
The W.C.T.U., aided and abetted bv a
few similar institutions, has issued a eir
cular, “Warnings to Girls.” The innocents
are advised not to motor with perfect
strangers, nor yet accept sweets, fruit- nr
flowers from same ; neither must they enter
strange buildings when cries of “Help” nr
Fire” hit the welkin. So far as I can see
this document has only succeeded in filling
the mind of each budding Polly or Sally with
feais that dark and devilish strangers are
lurking round each adjacent lamp-post for
the sole purpose of kidnapping her and
slowly torturing her to death or matrimonv
or bigamy. How often does a girl in real
life hear shouts of “Help” or “Fire” or even
Cauliflower” pouring out of a strange
building? 8
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Some of N the coastal towns have whispered
to the Commonwealth meteorologist that it
would be an advantage to shipping if the
Central station for Queensland were shifted
further north. The plea is that it would be
possible to get on the track of monsoonal
disturbances much more quichly than can
be done from Brisbane, and shipping could
thus receive earlier warnings. Which is
probably true; though what worries H. A.
Hunt isn’t so much the matter of collecting
the information as the indifference with
which shipping cos. and others receive the
warnings after they have been issued.
From the press gallery:—
The Denham Government put up a record of gag
and guillotine when it forced through the Elections
Bill, designed to make the rich man’s vote easy and
the poor man’s vote scarce. The Opposition was, of
course, out to hit the evil creation below the belt or
in any other vulnerable part. At the beginning
Labor members argued it; then they burlesqued it,
and finally stonewalled it. It took 24 hours to pass
the first few clauses, so great was the antagonism.
Then, with only 14 more sitting days in the session,
and much important business to deal with, Denham
decided on the guillotine. On the night of the exe-
cution it was just a matter of putting the clause,
ringing the bells, appointing the tellers and count-
ing heads. Members stuck to their seats as if glued
to them. The moral tone of the House soon fizzled
to zero. It laughed at itself and sneered at itself as
a representative institution. In the early hours of
the morning members became hungry and thirsty.
The Government Whip filled his pocket with fruit
and carried bananas into the Assembly and shared
them round. Occasionally an apple was flipped
across the Chamber to a favored member of the
Opposition. The pips were used freely when a snor-
ing member suggested that he was a fine target.
Pressmen in the galleries made wads of paper and
flicked them at the members below and occasionally
dropped hunks of refuse apple on the heads of the
messengers. Finally they rigged up a white flag
and hung it out of the gallery, but the message of
distress was unheeded. Legislators snored here and
there on the benches, and were counted without their
knowledge. The proceedings concreted into a nar-
row space all the infirmities of the present system of
Party Government. It is time we had a change
from it. Is there a State Premier in Australia who
is game to try a Bill which will give the system of
Elective Ministers a chance? The curse of machine
politics is over the land like a black fog.
The Denham Government has reintroduced
its Criminal Appeal Bill, and it will get a
lift through the case of Smith (B.
16/10/’l3) —-the Smith who was lately de-
tained in Boggo Road Gaol for 114 days.
Ten people swore that this man was a culprit
named Burns, who had uttered certain value-
less cheques in a bush township. Smith
bore a striking resemblance to Burns; and
but for certain police investigations which
proved conclusively that Smith was not
Burns, and that Burns wasn’t even Smith,
he would have gone up for certain. As it
was. the Injustice Department detained him
57 days after the police had satisfied them-
selves that he was innocent. Blair’s Bill
also provides for appeal against over-long
terms dealt out by livery or cranky Judges.
The English Appeal Court has been working
overtime lately in this direction. On one
day at the end of July it took 134 years off
three prisoners ; and there really isn’t much
danger of their Honors’ time being wasted
by prisoners on the mere off-chance of a re-
duction, since the Court has power to in-
crease as well as reduce any sentence brought
under notice.

Hunyadi Janos
For an adjustment of the system, to dispel Kidney Trouble, medical men
from time immemorial have advocated the use of watery purging. One of
the best of all such agents is Hunyadi Janos Natural Aperient Water.
It ensures a prompt, copious, painless and easy evacuation of the intestines.
Hunyadi Janos neither depresses the patient nor sets up a state of after-
constipation, two points of the utmost importance in dealing with patients
suffering from kidney complaints, which sooner or later give rise to much
emaciation, anaemia, and general debility of body and mind.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no be returned
unless stamps accompany.
L.G.M.: “The Name” suggests a sort of
carefully fostered and petted melancholy. Be cheer-
ful ! Read “Kodak’s” great work, in 18 volumes,
“How to Be Happy Though Buried.” Also
“10-2-4’s” monumental compilation, “Misery As a
Fine Art,” and “The Snake’s” monograph on “The
“Advantages of Being Less Dead Than You Think
You Are.” Then buy a new bonnet, and go out to
the races, and hilariously back the bob-tailed nag
that leadeth unto destruction.... Mummer: The
Bulletin didn’t accept Eardley Turner’s verse
because he worked for a big firm, and reject yours
because you labored for a small one. In a spirit
of brutal selfishness it published Turner’s verse
because it thought people would buy the paper
when they fancied he was about, and it didn’t pub-
lish yours because it feared they would avoid the paper
like a serpent if they thought you were about. Don't
write and say it is a hog-like attitude. We know it
is, and this is our hog-day... .W.K.S.: Motor poem
rather too technical, and too much learned technicality
makes for dreariness.... Ishmael: The trouble is
that the cow-serf has been written up so often in such
very similar strain. In fact, there is only one cow-
serf strain.... M.T.: Owing to an excessive rush of
moon and ripple verses yours was crowded -put.
Besides, you shouldn’t ripple twice in consecutive
verses. .. .C.A.M.: The fines are being paid by
si-alments, and, up to the present, *.300, has been
put up. No reduction in the penalties has been
made. .. .Constant R.: Can’t take that sort of news
without something better to support it than tne
mere initials (alleged) of the sender....’Enry: A
man whose information is so behindhand as yours
would Only fit one job on this earth. Get a billet
as Honorary Procrastinator to the royal family....
Con. F,: There are seven deadly sins, and the
names of them are Absurdity, Fear, Slump, Cold
Feet, Pork, Drink and Dog (the kind you put on).
Your ineffective villain merely steals his neighbor’s
wife Sarah Hills: Yes, it is a fact that the Gaud
Mayor of Sydney recently stated he wasn’t sure
whether foot passengers were expected to keep to the
right or the left. It is a strange thing, but he did.
Possibly he also doesn’t know whether cabs should
drive on the road or the footpath. .. ,N. : The brief
tale of Hamfat, the actor, lacks point. He simplv
planks down a very ordinary remark and passes
on. Anybody can be ordinary and pass on....
Uloola: There are good points about it, just as there
are about a partially bald porcupine. But we prefer
a porcupine with all its hair on. . . . Bellerive: A
circus half-tragedy:—
COMBAT BETWEEN A LION AND A POLAR
BEAR.
Upon a polar bear a lion
Made a savage attack
In spite of the keeper’s whom
Endeavored to beat him back
The polar bear who was
Prepared for the fray
Put up a fierce combat
With the king of prey
Wildly fought the antagonists
Determined and grim
The lion ripped the bear
And the bear ripped him
When the keepers with
Props did seperate,
The warriors whom were both
In a wounded state.
....Bell B.: We’ll drag along without them....
.... Ignotus: Sorry, unsuitable for B. Returning
MS. . . . Creymoyne: “Sweet, sweet!”.... D.F.L.:
Well-meaning verse, but quite useless to us. Thanks
for fine, legible MS R.B.: Ponderous N.D.:
Yes, but you didn’t see anything like “The Price.”
. ...C.V.A.: The time isn’t ripe for you....L.M :
Tragedy overstrained. Several good lines. ... Curlew
(Richmond) : Write any Sydney bookseller. Story
quite unnecessary Westralia: It hobbles along
and gets nowhere W. J.M.: Struggled through your
drinking song until we came to the statement that
the liquor was “as red as gore.” Then we left
off. . . .A.C.B.: Now in the shade of the basket....
R.B. (Q.) : You don’t do them justice. .. .R. Burns
(Scotland) : If we published vour poem with that
illustrious name attached, a thousand Scotchmen
would rise up and tell us it wasn’t in the published
wor-rks.”.... Y.: Regret unsuitable. ,. .W.K.B.:
There’s a story there, but you haven’t versified it
well. . . . W.A.C.: Thanks, but it isn’t what . we
want. .. .F.S.McD.: Just hopeless. .. .B.G.: Ttjat’ll
do! L.S.: Only answer to “A Query” is that it is
rejected. . . .Gunna M. : That sort of outburst isn’t
much good when all the decorations are up. When
they have been taken down, it is interesting only as
a curiosity Mardan: Some good material, but
there isn t enough in the sketch.... Barb Dwyer: But
you see,, the Australian capital isn’t “settled beyond
recall” at Canberra. The capital of England was
settled beyond recall at Winchester, that of Scotland
at Scone, of Ireland at Tara, of Italy at Florence of
Russia at Moscow, of India at Calcutta, of Burma
at Prome, of China at Nankin, of Maoriland at Auck-
land ; and they all shifted. The old capitals of
Persia and Egypt were so much fixed that they were
absolutely clamped down, and now the polyglot
guide shows the tourist where they used to be.
Bandicoot: There is a difficulty about your idea of
specially taxing the owner of a city block which is
wasted by being used as a foundation for an un-
sightly, one-storey humpy, in order to make him put
up a decent structure. It is quite possible that some
parents or guardians or trustees gave a long lease of
that block when the present owner was an infant,
they having no idea how the city would grow. Now
the tenant of the block won’t build because his lease
is nearly run out, and the owner of the block can’t
build because the long-distance tenant is still in
possession, and wants a ruinous sum to go out. That
is one reason why The Bulletin suggests municipal
ownership of land and buildings.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.W.D.: Interest not sufficiently general....
J.S.B. : Tell us —what bald-headed man asks his wife
if his hair is all right, just in order to give her
room for a bad joke?... .O.S.K.: About the most
buried joke up to date. The dust of mountains of
obscurity are on it. .. .H.A.S.: Did you spell Ass
wrongly? Or did you mean the signature to be
short for Has Been? Or, again, do the letters stand
for Hasn’t Any Show? Any one of these would be
appropriate... .Art: Two rotten drawings. .. .C.S.W.:
Another rotten drawing. .. .M.F.: The picture which
represents one human making an ordinary remark
to another is bad enough, but when it comes to one
fowl telling another that she is laying too many
eggs, it is over the odds.
“Camp”: Re the origin of the term
“hatter” (B. 2/10/’13). The word, in this
sense, is purely Australian, and was in
colloquial use, in Victoria at any rate, long
before the days of the diggings. In the
ante-gold era it was applied to the solitary
shepherds who were stationed in huts on the
then unfenced sheep-runs. One Australian
writer, years ago, stated that the original
term was “butter.” The long spells of soli-
tude, punctuated only by the annual week’s
spree, would, naturally, get on the nerves
of these men a bit, and many of them be-
came more or less cranky; hence “mad as a
hatter”—-another Australian phrase which
I’ve vainly looked for in English books of
quotations and colloquialisms.

“THE CHILDREN'S FOOD.”
The British Museum (London) has a first-rate col-
lection of old Australian playbills, including some
of the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, in the ’6o’s—the
time when Jefferson, Bafry Sullivan, Walter Mont-
gomery, Charles Kean and Charles Mathews were
radiating in Australia. The Museum has lately re-
ceived a notable addition to its collection-—a com-
plete set of the Henry Irving bills from Dec. 30,
1878 (when he became boss of London Lyceum),
until the night in 1906 when he fell lifeless on the
stage at Bradford, after, as the murdered Archbishop
of Canterbury in Tennyson’s “Becket,” he had ex-
claimed, “Into Thy hands, O Lord.” Tliis set was the
property of the late Bram Stoker, Irving’s secretary
and manager. Among the plays recorded' in these
bills is “King Lear,” which ran for more than a
hundred nights ; but during the closing performances
Irving s name does not appear—it was replaced by
that of Australia’s own “plain Bill” Holloway. The
collection is remarkable as showing the steady evo-
lution of the playbill. The early ones were poorly
printed on a couple of octavo pages, and contained
nothing but the cast, the scones and a favorable
notice or two from London papers. It was not until
the ’9o’s that there were any advertisements, though
in Melbourne and Sydney there had been a few in
the ’7o’s, and even earlier.

'Ulen’s (USA.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those vears of difference if you are grey or prema-

The Pumps of High Efficiency
and Low First Cost
The fact that MATHER & PLATT Pumps are the outcome of 38 years
of pump-building experience is a point that can be considered well by the
buyer of pumping machinery.
If these Pumps were not right—you would know it —their Makers would
know it —after 38 years.
Mather (0. Platt Hig'h
Lift Turbine Pumps
have stood the test.
Engineers prefer them, because they give a regular flow and because of
their freedom from water hammer.
There is no necessity for air vessels, and the motion being rotary there is
no shock due to reciprocating parts ; for the same reason these pumps are
particularly suitable for driving by electric motor.
Are not these advantages at least worth looking into? It will pay you to
get FULL details. Write for Booklet and full particulars NOW.

The Inky Way.
One of the biggest scoops in the newspaper business
was gained by Sydney Daily Telegraph when Aus-
tralia’s fleet foamed into home waters. The paper
sent a man to the West with instructions to “get
aboard the Flagship and come back to Sydney on
it.” The idea was to have a wad of “copy” ready
on arrival in Port Jackson. The young man smuggled
away, and was not heard of again until one morn-
ing the Telegraph blew down King-street with a
happy story signed “Our Special Representative Aboard
H.M.A.S Australia. By wireless.” Night after night
a message came through from over the air, and, but for
the Melbourne Age, which is on news reciprocity with
the Telegraph, the other Australian papers could
only stand helplessly and gnash their circulation.
There is nothing else to be said here about the
“scoop” except that the scooper was Lewis Deer, a
Sydney D.T. man who isn’t at all likely to talk big
about his performance.
“Orient” : Bearing in mind that our neighbors are
Japan and China, not Germany and France, 1 am a
close student of Oriental affairs, reckoning myself an
Austral-Asiatic, not a European. Yet the Japanese
action towards China is a mystery to me. Why?
Because we only get such news as is of interest
to faraway England. It comes just by ricochet
to us. Once more, then, 1 appeal for daily cables
from Tokio and Shanghai. It is a fact, mentioned
in the Japanese Diet or Parliament, that when Dr.
Sun’s Republican outbreak took place, the Chinese
emperor’s advisers appealed to Ijuini, the Jap Am-
bassador in Pekin, for intervention. He said: “The
Mikado will never allow a Republic in China.” This
being referred to in the Jan Parliament, the Prime
Minister said: “Ijuini acted on his own responsi-
bility.” Who can believe that ? Why is Japan sup-
porting the Chinese Republic? Evidently Japan
helped to make it. Now it is supporting the South
against the North—there are Japanese forces in South
China. Explain all these matters by proper news.
Give us materials. Never mind the marriage of the
Duchess of Fife.
“The Arcadian” : Struck a form of preference that
hits the non-party pressman hard in the place where
there is no quail on toast. Curiously enough, it is
practised by the Cook multitude that drifted into
office on more or less rotten planks, one being
pointed “No preference—free opportunities for all."
(This is not written in a partisan spirit, but merely
because I’m losing my Arcadian simplicity.) I
represent a non-party newspaper—there are a few in
Australia —and have lately come to realise that there
has been a remarkable change in my “luck.” Some-
how, important developments have taken place in
different matters after I have seen Ministers, or they
have occurred on the one day in the month when I
have got tired of repeating the demnition questions.
The explanation of said change in “luck” came the
other day when a member of the Cabinet, knowing I
knew something he knew but could only use when
he had given the word, blurted out, “I must keep
something for the other papers.” It was candid, but
it was preference, and preference of the worst type-
preference to the powerful press that put the party in
office; preference that is practised by most parties;
but preference that should not be resorted to by a
no-preference Government.

Brisbane Daily Standard has lost the services of
its two brightest writers. John Norton lured them

editorship of John’s local organ.

Adelaide Mail, the non-political Sunday paper
which started less than 18 months ago—Clarence Moody
leaving the Register to take command of it —touched
a sort of high-water level in its agricultural show
number. It ran to 44 pages—396 columns —which
is claimed to be the largest paper ever issued in Aus-
tralia. Certainly it might have been a vastly better
paper if it had owned a sub-editor with a square jaw
who would have reduced the whole thing to 10 pages ;
and it could have been done easily.
They still know how to be unconventional up
North.' A change is brewing in the Port Douglas
Record office; and this is how the news was broken:
“After what will practically amount to 12 long,
weary and unprofitable years’ connection with this
journal, the present manager has decided to get out
at the end of the current year.
“His one and only reason for doing so is that he
cannot, as a bachelor, see any logic or wisdom in
continuing the work for posterity when he ought to
be having a gorgeous time himself.
“He desires no requiem, but it would do much to
rehabilitate his faith in mankind if some of this
paper’s long-winded subscribers would refute his bad
opinion of them by paying up.
“A number of newsagency accounts will be closed
at the end of this month. We would gladly en-
courage any of our customers to try and break the
world’s record for endurance at Indian club-swing-
ing, roller-skating or waltzing, but there is a time
limit in our newsagency business, and it is going to
be enforced.”
This week’s champion bit of backblocks biography
on the death of one of the oldest inhabitants: “The
late Mr. J will be remembered as the father of
our two most enterprising and patriotic citizens,
and also his champion Jersey bull, well known to
our readers.” A border river paper takes the prize.

F. M. Cutlack, who came out on the flagship
Australia as a sort of official recorder for the Com-
monwealth Government, and gave the S. M. Herald
and other papers a few dandy columns about the big
guns and other things, is these days attached to
George Reid’s staff in London. Five years ago he
was a reporter on the Adelaide Register ; then he
wandered to the Big Smoke to look for an opening
on the press, and, like practically every other Aus-
tralian pressman who has gone that way, soon either
found or made one that led to hard work mixed
with decent money. In his case it was followed by
the offer of the job of official press-barracker for Aus-
tralia at J. Bull’s headquarters.
San Francisco Morning Call, after putting up a
half-century run, has closed up, having been
bought, lock, stock and barrel, by the rival Chron-
icle. ’Frisco therefore now has only two morning
papers, the Examiner and the Chronicle. The Call
was founded in 1856 by seven printers, and in 1895,
after going through various hands, was purchased
by the late Claus Spreckels, whose son, John D., . has
now sold out to the opposition he has fought hard
for 16 years.

“OK.”: Of The Bulletin’s services to society its
first was ’ one of its greatest. The first issue is
said to have “struck a death blow at Sydney Punch
and ridded the world of the wickedest weekly comic’
that ever was.” I don’t know from personal experi-
ence exactly how wicked Sydney Punch was, but I
have just read a 40-year-old book of “Punch Staff
Papers,” whereof the preface says: To give the
public an opportunity of judging for themselves of
the average work of local writers, the members of the
staff of Sydney Punch determined to unite and pub-
lish a work in which every man should have his
clvince How they have availed themselves of their
respective chances will be seen in the following
rasres.” The following pages are dull at their best,
and drivel at their worst. Some sets of verses by
Kendall are respectable, of course, but they are
almost as “soft” as the twaddlesome rhymes of S. H.
Banks and H. W. H. Stephen, and the stories and
essays of the other- Punch staffers. The nearest
approach to humor was achieved by Grosvenor Bun-
ster • most of the other yarns might have been
intended as cures for insomnia or incentives to
piety. # # , *
“Nemo”: In the old days of the Dublin Nation,
when Charles Gavan Duffy and Thomas Davis were
the chiefs, the British despot was almost invariably
referred to as “the Saxon”—in allusion, of course, to
the capture of England by the Saxons in the fifth
eenturv So it was a bit of a surprise to me when
T was lately in Dublin and bought a post-card, to
find upon it the words, “Printed in Saxony.” “The
base bloody and brutal Saxon”—Freetrade does make
us' acquainted with strange bedfellows.

Come In!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU whose hair is black as grief,
You whose lips are red as sin.
Lift the latch and turn the leaf—
Happy love, come in, come in !
From the caverns of your eyes—
. Eyes that seem so shy and meek
All the oracles arise
Joy’s hot mysteries to speak.
On your breast the blisses sleep—
Raptures supine, soft and twin—
By the secrets that you keep,
Happy love, come in, come in !
From the roundness of your throat
Throbs a music silver sweet,
And delicious airs afloat
Tremble laughter round your feet.
By your touches silken light.
By your hot, brown fingers thin.
By your kisses in the night.
Happy love, come in, come in !

Haunted.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN I was a boy I looked upon
sleep as an infliction. It was
.something which stole vast
stretches of time which might have been
much more pleasantly spent among the
books of the library, or in exploring the re-
cesses of the patch of dense forest which
swept almost from our back door half-way
up the mountain that towered over our
home. I used to love that bush, for the
country was almost denuded of its big tim-
ber. A sawmill had been working on it for
years, and Canterbury is not overwooded.
'The forest was lined and seamed with good
roads, medium roads, beastly roads and mere
tracks. So though it was dense enough
there were open spaces in it. It was full of
beautiful flowers like clematis, wild con-
volvuli, rata, and a dozen others too numer-
ous to mention. It gleamed with gorgeous
berries, streams babbled through it, and a
succession of tumbling cascades made the
melody of falling waters; and every swamp,
every creek, every rotting log was a wilder-
ness of beautiful ferns. I used to dream I
was an emperor, that the bush was my
realm, and that I defended it with a hand-
ful of splendidly-trained and armed soldiers
against overwhelming odds of fierce in-
vaders.
Rut no invader ever came, which was just
as well. I have never had an army, and the
only regiment that ever followed me was
one of creditors.
So I grudged time spent in sleep—sleep
that came on me like a soft-footed thief and
robbed me of my pleasures of book and
forest, and drove me to bed, and as soon as
the chill had gone off the sheets, stole sense
and memory.
At school it was the same. I always
slept well and long. When I had boyish
worries I laid my head on the pillow and
they were as though they had never been.
When I toiled in the Railway Depart-
ment that gift of splendid sleep still stuck
to me. No anxiety ever wore me out; no
worry ever got me down. Even rheumatism
could not keep me awake. I had troubles
and anxieties enough ; everybody who works
on a railway has. But I slept their keen-
ness away and they broke against the gift
of slumber. In that one thing I was rich
beyond measure, and I know now how great
a treasure it was —far above rubies and
beyond price.
It was in Sydney I lost my fortune. I
had been Rockefeller and I became a beggar.
They drugged me with strange potions to
relieve rheumatism —things like iodide of
potassium, which depressed the system and
stimulated the imagination, and clothed the
most ordinary affairs of life with the
gloomy grandeur of a Wagnerian opera. I
know now where St. John of Patinos got
the inspiration for the Book of Revelation.
He suffered from rheumatism and insomnia.
He took to drink to cure the insomnia, and
then they gave him iodide to drive the
rheumatism and the drink out of him. and
he got Revelation instead. I could write
Revelation myself on that mixture. Some
day I may do it.
It started with wakefulness at first. I
found myself disinclined to go to bed because
I was not sleepy, and a man afflicted with
rheumatism cannot lie comfortably. He
aches, and rest without sleep is impossible.
He turns; he twists ; he screws himself into
strange attitudes to get surcease; and gets
it for five minutes at the outside if he gets
it at all. Better to sit up and read, or write
stories, or do photography. I did all three.
Rut my ability to sleep grew less and less.
It was bad —quite bad enough—but, at
least, when I did drop away into oblivion
ff was slumber fit for a king, so that I
awoke strong once more. Two hours, of
that sort of insensibility put fresh life into
•ue and left a sweet savor on all my senses.
All insomnia patients have little tricks
by which they try to trap sleep, as it were.
It is like trying to catch a fish asleep. Some
count till they think they have reached a
quadrillion or "so, but it is said they never
? et past a connle of millions. Personally I
think that method must be very exhausting.
JHhers draw the forefinger down the fore-
head and the ridge of the nose ; but my own
device was to lie on my right side, close
the eyes, look down through the fast shut
;ids, breathe very regularly and deeply, and,
in my imagination, watch the breath issuing
trom the nostrils. I often got a succession
of short naps that way.
One morning 1 realised that I had slept
splendidly. 1 was good. The world was
absolutely beautiful. I felt that 1 was
about to recover my punch. That night I
looked eagerly for the time when I should
?0 to bed. lii fact. I became as as I
u sed to be when 1 had an appointment with
Her in the vestibule of the Trocadero. At
last 1 had recovered the gift of self-
obliteration, and my wealth had come back
to me. The beggar was Rockefeller once
more.
* * *
“ was just dozing off when I heard a loud
usslih !’ Rut, as if in detianee of the warn-
ing, someone commenced to chatter in a
loud, cracked sort of whisper right at my
ear. It was my right ear, too —the one on
tne pillow. It was a male chatter, but it
was jan tiered so fast that I failed to catch
the words. I knew 1 was dreaming, and
struggled to ignore it. Rut 1 could not,
and at last 1 woke right up. Immediately
the chatter ceased.
I was alone in the room, which had been
specially chosen because it was well away
liom the street, and the street was a quiet
one, devoid of trams and cabs. Nevertheless,
i locked my door.
Every time I got off to sleep the same in-
ternal chattering would recommence and
continue till 1 woke right lip. It was 4 a.m.
when 1 got out of bed. lit the gas and com-
menced to read. Then I must have dozed off
again before I had finished the first para-
graph, for the voice broke out agaiu ; the
clamor of a garrulous old man without teeth
—an ancient who was hurrying through
what he had to say, talking fast to prevent
someone breaking in on his wretched tale,
which was all a tale about nothing.
►Some time before he became a spook he
seemed to have lived to a great age in some
secluded hamlet, where the wildest happening
was a hard winter or the fall of an old in-
habitant’s chimney. And lie reeled off the
annals of his quiet neighborhood like a
demented patriarch—annals of births and
marriages and deaths, of clods and plough-
horses and old maids, of dogs and measles
and broken fences and ruts and tombstones,
and everything else that was mouldy beyond
imagining.
Fortunately the next day was Sunday,
and I slept most of the afternoon. Appar-
ently the chatterer slept also, for he never
worried me through the lighted hours. Rut
that night he was back again, invisible but
noisy.
hor weeks I heard his crackling voice
only. 'Then one night he appeared in his
own proper wraith. I seemed to open my
eyes and find him squatting on the edge of
my bed. He was a ridiculous figure—a little
wizened old horror without teeth. There
was nothing terrific about him. He was
merely repulsive in an absurd, frowsy old
high hat with a brim about half an inch
wide. He had a spotted scarf round his dis-
colored and wrinkled neck, and his dirty
grey coat had the collar turned up right
round his depraved ears. His shrivelled
legs were encased in objectionable and
shapeless trousers of the same faded grey;
and when he got down and zig-zagged
across the floor I saw. with disgust, that he
walked apparently on the stumps of his
knees.
I woke right up and found myself staring
into utter blackness.
I swore loudly, and turned myself into a
different position, and listened to the clock
chiming at intervals. When I had heard it
chime five times I forgot everything; and
just as I ceased to be aware of anything, he
fell into the room, talking numerously as he
fell.
Somehow I seemed to get accustom-d to
this jim-jam, and declined to allow myself
to be awakened by him. Rut the result was
just the same. My brain was practically
toiling all night in the effort to catch what
the rude forefather of the hamlet was saying,
and I woke up in the last stage of ex-
haustion.
Sometimes I saw only his head and shoul-
ders. Sometimes he was lost in darkness
below the waist. Sometimes, mostly—in
fact generally always—he was alone; but
occasionally—that is to say frequently and
now and then, and at long intervals which
were sometimes shorter —he was ac-
companied by a female like unto him-
self, but more repulsive. Presumably
she was his mother-in-law. Her cackle
was more nerve-racking and shriller.
And when I grew weary of it, I
would wake up in despair to stop the dis-
tressful connle, and find myself in lonely
darkness. The peace of the awakening was
delightful after the turmoil of sleep.
The doctors looked grave when I told
them, but. with the wisdom of the serpent,
which is also a silent animal, they said
nothing. All save one, and he spoke to the
man wiio accompanied me—spoke to him in
private, and urged the employment of a
specialist, for he regarded me as wpli on the
way to what my friend euphemistically
styled “the Rat-House.”
They d.dn’t mean me to hear them, but I
had acquired a wonderful long-distance ear
through listening to the old spook and his
mother-in-law amid my dreams. There were
times when I could make out an early-morn-
ing tram-passenger refusing to pay his fare
two streets away. ~
I threw their drugs away and drank much
milk; ate largely of lettuce soused with
plentv of olive oil; and each night before I
got into bed I wound up and placed under
mv pillow a small musical box. I waited
anxiously the first night to see how it would
pan out, and woke in the morning still in a
state of concentrated curiosity. I was weary
though, for it had not been “good” sleep.
Next night the vision came in with a crash
and a clatter and with all the boots of a cen-
tipede. But the music of the box grew
louder, till it swelled and rolled and pealed
like the great choral pipe of Sydney Town
Hall organ, and utterly drowned the voice of
him and the cry of the reinforcement of his
mother-in-law. At last they sat there,
worried but silent, occasionally mouthing
with their toothless gums. Then they sud-
denly vanished, and as they went the music
died down, and at last it fi d into the dis-
tance.
Next day the house was in revolt. The
music that sent me to dreamless sleep woke
everyone else up, and they demanded that the
box should be burned at the stake like a
heretic. I refused absolutely, and left in a
hansom cab for new quarters in a quiet spot
by the seashore. Half-way there, the driver
asked me for some directions, and I looked
rm through the trap (I hadn’t taken stock
of him before), and saw that he was my
insomnia phantom of the night—the male
one.

Spring Skin-Troubles Banished.
With the approach of Spring do you find little rough
patches on your forehead, or cheek, or chin? Has your
skin a curious “tight” feeling? Are your hands or
finger-ends sore? Is your skin disfigured by nasty
pimples, boils, abscesses or eruptions? Have you a
raw, tender feeling where your skin creases—or are
you very liable to chafing about the neck?
These “danger signals,” which constitute the first
signs of an unhealthy skin, should never be neglected.
Following in their train are all the tortures of fiery
eczema, wide-reaching blood poison, and ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should
treat this skin disease. It is not the slightest use rely-
ing upon any internal remedy or external application if
these do not reach the impurity itself, which is the
cause of the disorganisation in our delicate and intricate
tissues. Cheap and coarse ointments and so-called
blood-mixtures may make eczema “slumber” awhile,
but the disease soon breaks forth in all its “fire” and
itching irritation, for the root-evil has not been touched.
Zam-Buk is the ideal Spring Skin-Balm. Zam-Buk
is so refined that the tissues absorb it readily; and its
medicinal essences at once attack the disease below the
surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by acci-
dent or eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth
of new and healthy tissues in a quick and natural
, manner.
ifiam-Buk, the invalu-
able Spring- Skin-Balm,
is excellent for Boils,
Pimples, Eruptions,
Eczema, Abscesses and
Blemishes; & promptly
heals Cuts, Burns,
Sores, Bruises, Abra-
sions, Scalds, Scalp
Troubles, Wounds,
Piles, Sprains, etc.
Obtainable from all

Mr. H. Christie, of 16 London Street, Enmore, Sydney, says:—“l was
troubled with boils, and tried all manner of things to get rid of them, but
to no avail. Seeing Zam-Buk advertised, 1 procured a pot, and applied it
as directed, with the pleasing result that the boils had entirely disap-
peared after three days’ treatment.”

Colic, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

The quick relief afforded by Cham-

whooping cough makes it a favorite
with mothers of small children. It
liquefies the tough mucus, makes it
easy to expectorate, keeps the cough
loose and counteracts any tendency
for it to result in pneumonia.
COUGH REMEDY.
Then I looked ahead and saw that there
were two animals dragging the vehicle —the
horse I had started with and the female
.phantom. They ran side by side, but the
female phantom seemed to be the better
runner of the two.
So I realised that they were removing
uilong with me, and that I would never
get rid of them till I was dead.
When I got to my new quarters the horse
was alone, and it was quite an ordinary
driver who carried in my luggage —all save
the musical box. lie said a little old man
had grabbed it and taken it upstairs. When
I reached my room I met the little old man
coming out. He had become a permanent
daylight spectre now —the incarnation of in-
somnia. And he has stayed with me ever
since. His female accomplice seldom comes
save in the hours of darkness, but perhaps
she will also, in a very short time, establish
herself as a permanent companion all the 24
hours.
And then I will never be lonely.
C. A. JEFFRIES.
Sleeping Out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UPON my boarding-house descended a
swarm of cheerful immigrants in
transit, presumably, to the land.
Being a person of morose habit, I regarded
this as a personal injury. From every peg
their tweed caps dangled; behind every knife
and fork their red lips smiled. Beside the
rest of us—proud of the fact that our skin
resembled smoked mutton —these new-comers
had the fresh and juicy appearance of joints
well kept in cool storage. The blow came
at last. My landlady, with a "notice-to-
quit-if-you-do-not-like-it” expression in her
eye, asked me to share my room with two of
these newchums. It was too much. I
bought a half-guinea tent and retreated to
the yard. Leaving the shed to the right, the
fowl-house to the left, the dog-kennel to the
north, and a colony of dustbins to the
south, there was still room for my new bed-
room. So 1 started to put it up.
It was infernally hot work digging. The
earth’s formation in our yard, too, is a curious
stratum of clay and burnt-out coke, rich in
nuggets of brickbats, tins and old shoe-
leather. But I bullocked ahead. Even then
I had an immigrant shadow. He was a self-
satisfied cherub in yellow boots, who, inter-
ested in my enterprise, got in my way and
held the tent-pole awry. He exuded advice
—until he let the mass of timber fall on my
head. When I recovered, 1 told him exactly
what I thought of him as 1 wrestled alone
with the tent. My eyes were on the ground,
but the yellow boots looked a trifle paler as
they hurried away.
1 got the tent up at last. It was quite
dark when I finished the job, and the calm
eternal stars were looking down curiously
at the yard, the dust-boxes and the human
wreckage which was me.
Sighing deeply, I inserted myself between
the flaps and retired from the world. Un-
dressing was a bit awkward, but I felt
fairly happy when I stretched myself out
and flapped wearily at the mosquitoes that
had mistaken me for imported food. They
soon drew off, and 1 lay quiet and listened
to the scratching scurry of rats up the zinc-
lined drain and the nasal bawling of the
gramophone next door.
At last, lulled by the flapping and bellying
of my canvas and the creaking of the new
rope, I slept. Two minutes—or it may have
been two hours —later I awoke with a start.
Something odorous was near —something
weird and uncanny, but sufficiently debased
to be driven out. After deep and earnest
thought I decided to strike a match and in-
vestigate. I did so, and found exactly what
I expected—the faithful but stinking house-
dog. At least that’s what it was always
trying to be. Actually it was only a yard-
dog.
“Get out!” I hissed, dragging my coat
from underneath him. The faithful thing,
knowing me of old, licked my hand and
thudded with his stumpy tail on the hard
ground. Catching him by the neck, I flung
him into exterior darkness and went back
to bed. As I was dozing off I heard him
come in again and curl down.
The next interruption was supnlied by
the rats which had started to besiege the
kitchen with their front teeth. “It will
take the d —d things years!” I reflected, and
pulled the bedclothes over my ears to shut
out the sound of gnawing—tireless, grisly
gnawing. It sounded like the Devil eating
bones in a churchyard. They seemed to
have suspended operations to fight and
squeak when next my brain slowed down.
Stung to madness by the riot, I rose, lit the
candle and flung a half-brick with murderous
intent at the soft-furred bodies bunched near
the drain. Crash! The senior dust-box
rumbled in the dark and fetched up against
a flower-pot containing “Bleeding Heart.”
It succumbed at once. Snapper, the decayed
house-dog, hovered uneasily in the shadows
while I fumbled about the washhouse for the
rat-trap. This I set, and then I retired to
bed again to await the “catch.”
'Boo — ough! Fla — lap!” sighed the tent
as the wind pawed at it with hands of air,
and walked over it with impalpable feet.
“Soo — ough!” The side retreated, dragging
its edge wearily. “Thwack!” It clouted
me smartly on the return journey, and, for
the moment, made me forget the rats, which
had started work again.
“Gnaw, gnaw, nibble, gnaw!” Then sil-
ence for a space. I imagined them stop-
ping their grinding, grating work to huddle
together in conference and ask each other if
the time was yet ripe.
“Flop, thud, thud!” A shadowy drift of
cats went over an adjacent roof like flying
ghosts. The hen-house, hitherto silent save
for the somnolent clucking of a light-sleep-
ing hen, suddenly awoke to full chorus. The
fool of a rooster crowed twice and flapped
energetically. All the sleepy fowls took
offence, and said so. The chief wife of the
harem nagged so long that her Sultan, sud-
denly revolting, knocked her off the perch
amid general disorder and cries of “Shame!”
Then there was a court case and much tire-
some argument. An old “Brahma” gave
judgment for the cock with costs, and the
Sultana retired in stately fashion to the nest.
I dozed a little before the homing cats
again vaulted heavily over the galvanised
iron roof.
Simultaneously with these came a loud
bumping and clattering in the washhouse. I
rose and rushed to secure and murder the
accursed rat, only to tind that the prisoner
was our greedy kitten. I released it and
stumbled back to my couch to find the faith-
ful but unspeakable Snapper established on
my pillow. I threw him out at a muzzle
velocity of 10,000 ft. per second, and felt
better for the bump and yelp with which he
collided with the unseen fence.
The restless, whimpering wind bellied the
canvas and fanned the surface-grit half-
heartedly. It seemed to be trying to make
up its mind to be a storm. An empty tin
became animated and bowled about the yard
as though a team of spirits were footballing
there. Loose corrugated iron in the vicinity
whined and sawed miserably without ceas-
ing. But in spite of all, I succeeded in get-
ting to sleep once more.
Towards dawn 1 gradually emerged from
Arctic dreams and found that the bedclothes
had basely deserted me. Snapper had drawn
them off with his teeth to make a couch for
himself. I carefully sorted out my right
boot, and put it on. Then I approached the
old dog-ruin, and kicked him heartily for the
good of his soul. The wind started scream-
ing—possibly as a protest against my bru-
tality—from the south. The dirt and dust
which had been travelling past all day re-
turned mixed with fine sea-sand. The wind
became momentarily more furious, and my
respectful tent bent before it. “You-u-uch-
-f-lap! You-u-uck — f-lap!” sobbed its
sides. The tail-flap, fantastically entering,
smote me in the eyes, and the fig tree, lashed
to fury, pelted the decayed Snapper and me
with unripe fruit. Buckets abandoned them-
selves to the elements and rattled on the
stones, till the first fury of the gale had
passed. Then a fine soaking rain began to
fall.
While trying to persuade Snapper to let
me have an end of blanket, I touched the
roof with my hand. It instantly gave up
all pretence of being rain-proof, and started
to weep steadily down my back. Suddenly
a hurricane gust of wind tore at the tent
and partly uprooted it. Snapper, scenting
disaster, in the way only possible to an aged
“black and tan,” adjourned in haste to the
open. As he disappeared, my uprights came
up and the wet tent gracefully subsided.
When I disentangled myself from the
ddbris, I contrived a toga out of the quilt,
retreated to the house, and stepped lightly
to the dining-room—the only apartment
left me by the devastating immigrants.
Before folding myself into the couch I con-
trived out of two chairs, I thought it might
be as well to investigate a mysterious, inter-
mittent light in the hall. Hitching up my
counterpane, I crept cautiously to the door
and looked out. I observed the landlord
sidling along the passage, lamp in one hand,
firewood in the other. His gaze was floor-
ward. His ample pyjamas fluttered in the
merciless draught. At first sight he ap-
peared to be practising some intricate steps
in skating. Gracefully, in a stooping atti-
tude, with long, gliding movements, he
swooped from end to end of the long, nar-
row aperture. It looked like a religious
dance. Then something scuttled past—
something small and soft, with a hard tail
that thwacked the skirting boards. A rat!
Pitta-pat! Pitta-pat! Its toenails tapped
distinctly on the linoleum, and beat a tattoo
on the hallstand. Its beady eyes stared in
terror from among the umbrellas. Then
it darted suddenly into the living tomb we
call “the drawing-room.” The murderous
landlord followed. I watched proceedings
through the drawing-room door, which is
glass-panelled, and beautifully hand-painted
with views of the Thames, by an immigrant
of artistic tastes. Within this new arena
the conflict began in earnest. The rat,
finding itself hard pressed behind the after-
noon tea-table, bolted into the open. Swoop-
ing like an eagle, the white-robed priest of
the lamp met it there. But luck was
against him. The wood smote only the
floor, and the rat leaped safely into the
grate. Through the bars, I saw its eves
aglare with terror, as it entered a squeaking
apneal for mercy.
My landlord has faith in the “power of
the eye.” He tried now to hold the rat by
it, while'lie advanced stealthily, his lamp
swaying, his firewood upraised.
I began to feel sorry for that rat. My
heart went out to him. The firewood was
still poised to kill. Then —“ Got you!”
growled the enemy, and hurled his billet.
Crash! Bang! All the fire-irons jumped
in the fender. I caught a biograph im-
pression of the rat steeplechasing over the
bars, and heard a curse and a dull, sicken-
ing thud. The landlord was prone upon his
stomach, the lamp still miiaculously bal-
anced. "Dammit!” he whimpered, and
knocked his bald head on the sofa leg.
He rose stiffly, for he is a corpulent man
as well as a bad loser. But he was not
going to abandon the fight. He is a bad-
tempered, mulish man, and “Never say die”
is his motto. After a while he located the
foe and glode forward to the attack. The
rat darted under the “what-not”—an im-
possible piece of furniture which bears bur-
dens of glass-framed photos. Crash! The
firewood hit the place the rat was the time
before last, and rebounded on to the place
where it will be next week. The flimsy “what-
not” shuddered, and strewed its load of
photos on the carpet. My landlord held the
lamp on high, and cursed thoughtfully. The
rat was now safe behind the piano. And
then the lamp flickered uneasily and went
out. Tired of the midnight futilities, I
softly opened the glass-panelled door, and
presently heard the thankful rat patter
through and scurry away from the land-
lord’s unlighted profanity. I listened with
interest, as he groped for matches and told
the absent rodent what he intended to do
when he got a light. It was very blood-
thirsty, and would certainly have spoiled
the carpet. The horrors of the Inquisition
were afternoon tea by comparison. I left
when I heard the rattle of matches. It
was about to start again. Softly closing
the door (Did I tell you he is, deaf, as well
as stupid and fat?), I left him to his labors.
My last waking impression, as I fell
asleep in my armchair, was of someone
shifting furniture, and at intervals emitting
murderous grunts.
