The King is an author!
Over my heart
I hug his book;
A volume in “full leather”
Filled with king’s words,
Five to a sentence.
They are royal words,
Polished as courtiers;
And smooth;
Smooth as a diplomat’s tongue
Or a chancellor's poll.
Yet hard;
Hard as enmity!
Hard as justice!
Hard as forgiving is!
Yet grey;
Grey as penitence!
Yet bright;
Bright as a new bride’s eyes.
But 1 scan these words
Not with king’s eyes,
Or bride’s, or diplomat's
Or chancellor’s eyes,
But with a warrior’s vision
For I shall speak these words
Level across the air!
With ardor!
Zealously !
With flame!
Knowing that each
May touch a heart,
Or bow d knee in prayer,
Seeking forgiveness for the rapine-
clutch;
For the riven blouse;
The desecrated gown!
So am I proud
Holding these words
— King’s words;
—Round words;
—Polished words;
—Hard icords;
—Smooth syllables;
—Pale phrases;
—For I will deliver them
—By God, I will!

“This is probably the last book I’ll pub-
lish,” says “Gossip” (R. McMillan) in his
Cities of* the War and Other Stories (W.
Brooks, 3s. (id.), reprinted from The Stock
and Station Journal. And he has
published many books and lived, as he says,
“a lot.” Tramp, whafer, temperance lec-
turer, parson, bookkeeper, book-writer —“and
few people guess as they look at me now, a
pleasant, grey-haired old gentleman, what a
life I have led.” Aiul when he looks back
on his life as a whole, it does not seem to
him to amount to much. “What do I think
of it? Not a great deal, I can assure you l”
“Gossip” is the sort of writer who calls
Shakespeare “William” and Alexander the
Great “Sandy,” and writes in a conversa-
tional manner, without the least pretence of
style, using sloppy adjectives and the other
loose attributes of “Jargon”; but he takes
his reader by the buttonhole, or the ear, and
fills him full -of interesting facts; and even
his garrulity has a charm, since there is
always behind it a personality eagerly inter-
ested in life and well stocked with experi-
ence. This volume deals chiefly with the
ancient civilisations and cities of the world
which are once more enveloped in war. And
Billjim, who is now sight-seeing in those
historic places, will no doubt be interested
in “Gossip’s” ancient history and modern
journalism.
That is musical, simple and sincere, aptly
expressing a very human longing. But in
most of his Outback subjects W. M. I lennng
failS to reach the level of the masters ot
this typical Australian metier. But Bill-
jim’s troubles, whether droving or driving
a wedge through Hindenburg’s line, about
the artistic or emotional quality of verse, so
long as it reminds him of the bush. In
“Nature,” and in a few other pieces, the
author suggests a sterner philosophy. Thus
he aptly makes Nature say:—
I starve the young birds in the nests I make
the aged die,
I watch the lovers re-createj I watch and
what care 1? ....
With strange beliefs and senseless creeds I
hold the world in fee;
That none may learn in bitterness there are
no gods but me. ... .. ?
Alike to me are shaven priest and king and
drunken 50t....
The past is mine, the future yours; I pay
but what you earn.
There are one or two interesting sonnets;
and his patriotic verses are vigorous. But
he is more at home in writing of the Out-
back Billjim than of his cobber in the
trenches. And this page returns from the
too-familiar bush verse, in the somewhat
hackneyed metre, to a slight but taking
thing like “Clarissa’s Call” : —■
Germanism from Within (Constable, 7s,
6d. in England), by A. D. McLaren, author
of An Australian in Germany, published
three years before the war, is the 79t.h heavy
book published upon Germany since the
trouble began: it is the 71st too many. So
many writers are nowadays being solemn
and pontifical over Germany that this page
refuses to read, the 80th. A, D. McLaren
claims that for the past 30 years he has
been investigating the question: What is
Deutschtum, and its mission? And for many
years he has been studying the Hun in its
own habitat. He finished his investigations
behind the barbed-wire fence of Ruhleben.
All right. But there was no need tot him
to add another large lump of road-metal to
the cairn already heaped, by professors and
journalists, upon the Deutschtum's corpse.
True, the author is fairer to the Hun than
most of his fellows. “The Germans are the
best-educated people in the world, and the
most clean-living. I could hardly over-
state the extent to which this sense of
superiority exists in Germany.” We learn,
too, that Australia’s problem of peopling her
vast empty spaces is the subject of frequent
discussion in the German press. And the
author says that the imperial solidarity ex-
pressed by the British Empire had greater
effect _ upon the Teutonic mind than the
material support given by the Dominions.
But A. D. McLaren has evidently stayed
too long in Germany. His book is as
solemn and inert as an exegesis by a Hun
professor. Even the announcement that
parts of it originally appeared, in a slightly
different form, in Sydney Daily Telegraph,
does not appreciably lighten the gloom.
d*
John Roycroft calls his N on-Pretentious
Verses. They are.
I am ofttimes told by people
That a genius am I;
But I know they do not mean it,
And the thought doth make me sigh.
However, “a copy will be forwarded to any
address in Australia on receipt of a sixpenny
postal note, obtainable at any post office, and
two penny stamps (not attached), to John
Roycroft, 19 Terrace-street, New Farm,
Brisbane, Q.” Seems easy.
“The feather was 'swept from her fingers
by an atmospheric disturbance, Which may
have arisen, say, by Teddy’s ghost stopping
with a jerk in the midst of its joyous dive
towards her presence, and kicking itself.”
That is one of the finest literary examples
of the famous Anzac grin.
“N. or M.”: In the face of Flecker and
the Red Page (19/4/T7) I maintain that
the former tinkered most of the quality out
of his Stygian verses when he altered
them. Granted that he “did away with the
weakening and superfluous adjective,” he
also did away with atmosphere and vision.
Take the first version with its slow rhythm.
We hear the bird’s song drift along the
shores of Lethe—a voice from the living
world, and see the trees of some remembered
ridge rise dark against the sky; and, sud-
denly, at the sound, the w T andering shades
know that they are dead, cut off for ever
from the world of men, and one reaches out
a timid hand to draw his' brother phantom
nearer. In the second version Pegasus trots
complacently, the ghosts remember catego-
rically “the trees, the wind, the golden
day” and “At last [not with the dawning
amaze of “suddenly”] they know that they
are dead.” I am reminded painfully of the
“improved” version of Gray’s Elegy, which
also eliminates unnecessary adjectives and
adverbs, and opens smartly:—-
The curfew tolls the knell of day,
The lowing herds wind o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward wends his way
And leaves the darkening ivorld to me.
In Far North-East Siberia we are taken
by I. W. Shklovsky (Macmillan, per
Dymock’s Library) to a desolate land where
the ground is. frozen in winter to a depth
of more than 700 feet, and in summer thaws
only to about six inches, and where: “At
the end of the nineteenth century, thousands
of people were living the life of troglodytes,
knowing nothing of bread, obliged to do
without salt, obtaining fire by the primi-
tive method of friction, not knowing the
use of soap, having no linen, and wearing
their fur clothing upon their naked skins.
In this mprnner live not only savages but
Russians, and all are in constant fear lest
the river should thaw too late, or that the
water should oyerflow the fishing-places, for
then would begin starvation and death.”
Anyway, the disappearance of these tribes
is assured, for the Russians brought with
them small-pox and syphilis, and the ravages
of these diseases have been terrible. The
inhabitants of certain villages are practi-
cally rotting alive with syphilis and scurvy.
The country is isolated from the rest of the
world by an endless ring of marshes and a
chain of mountains. The nearest “civi-
lised” centre, Yakutsk, is four months’ jour-
ney away.
The price of a girl in the Farthest North-
East .is one block of tea and one cup of
vodka, a little .less than the price of a rein-
deer. (Block-tea and vodka are the only
currency.) The people are perpetually in
the debt, and perpetually the slaves, of the
traders. The Russians living there have
completely degenerated, and live like sav-
ages. And the morals of these' savages are
indicated by the phrase : “A woman is not
a roll for one man’s meal.” The villagers
suffer, too, from the terrorism of the crimi-
nals who are banished to these regions,
which are officially marked, “Unsuitable for
human habitation,” and to which only the
worst convicts are transported.. And all
that the mothers can give their babies is
raw frozen fish.
In this bleak polar land the author spent
some years. Of the fur trade and the busi-
ness of finding mammoth tusks he provides
many interesting particulars.
Australasian bards and writers who wish
to vote, in order, 1 for six Australasian persons
to form the nucleus of the Republican Acad-
emy of Australasia, may vote for six or fewer
names, but should indicate very briefly then-
reasons for each of their choices. The quali-
fication of a voter is the publication in this
paper of story or verse. The voter whose
ballot-paper most nearly resembles _ the
declaration of the poll will receive a guinea.

W. M. Fleming collects his various verses
in' Australia in Peace and War (Lothian,
Melb., 55.). He belongs to the “Banjo”
and the Lawson mob, singing tire bush, the
horse, the pioneers, the plains, “The Wider
Ways,” and writing patriotic but otherwise
undistinguished verses on the war and Aus-
tralia’s share of it. Here is “The Drover” :
When softly the night-dews are falling
They rob me of rest,
Those voices of cattlemen calling,
Away in the West.
And I rise in my fancy and follow,
By tracks that are worn to a hollow,
The ways I love best.
The sheep which are bleating around me
Are cattle that low;
The fences and lanes which surround me
Are creeks that ive know.
For free is the country, and splendid,
With plains that can never be ended,
Where cattlemen go.
The horns of the bullocks are gleaming
Around in the sun;
The horses are dosing, and dreaming
Of stages we’ve done.
The herbage is knee-deep beside us,
No cockles to bother and chide us,
’Tis no man’s run.
The locusts are chirping a chorus
From bowers of green,
The country is open before us,
Unbroken and clean.
Behind us the blue-grass is bending
In far-fading vistas unending,
the track we have been.
And ever where night-dews are falling
They rob us of rest,
Those voices of cattlemen calling,
Away in the West,
And rising in fancy ice follow,
By tracks that are worn to a hollow,
The ways we love best.
Galling, calling,
And the kine are coming up— *
Dandelion, Buttercup,
Queenie’s Gift and all —
Coming up in careless way
Through the closing of the day,
At Clarissa’s call.
Calling, calling,
And my heart is thrilled to hear
Tones so honey-sweet and clear,
As they rise and fall.
Far upon the mountain side
I can hear them as I ride,
Hear Clarissa's call.
Calling, calling,
Comes for me alone the cry.
I alone can hear, and I
Cross the shadows tall.
Shadows that the moon has thrown
O’er the path I long have known,
At Clarissa’s call.
(There is more of Clarissa; but that is
where she should have stopped.)
Calling, calling.
Often has she called me so,
In a way true lovers know,
.At the evenfall.
Oh, the sweetly upturned face!
Oh, the soul-enchanting grace
Of Clarissa's call!
Calling, calling,
Through the years that are to be
She will ever come to me,
When the shadows fall.
Yestereve she gave her vow.
Haile! my heart is leaping now
At Clarissa’s call.
Arthur L. Brewer writes authentic Aus-
tralian. 'Gators’ Euchre and Other Stories
(Aust. Authors’ Agency, Melb., 25.) con-
tains a number of stories with which
readers of this publication should be
familiar. The quality of this collection is
mixed, ranging from stuff of a high literary
value to flippant journalism. The title
story brilliantly suggests the mood of im-
pending tragedy, cunningly adumbrated by
the cumulative effect of a quiet opening
with a growing suspicion of the uncanny;
but it is little more than an episode. He
writes of passion with a grim realism; and
his style is—well, a style that mere mod-
esty, or pain, prevents us from particularis-
ing. His stories are as interesting as an
Abo. par, and as neatly written. Take a
paragraph like this for its knowledge of
life: “He kissed her for the last time, and
swung into the saddle. Then he bent down
and kissed her for the last time again, rode
away, and returned and kissed her for the
last time once more.” True, isn’t it? His
observation of Nature Outback is close
witness his three-page description of the
imitative capacities of the lyre-bird in. its
song. However, Arthur L- Brewer can
rest his reputation as a writer upon “Going
Home.” This is a pathetic story of a dying
soldier upon a returning troopship. Brewer
works naturally upon the reader’s sympa-
thies up to the death of the soldier and his
last message to the Australian girl awaiting
him. Then he has got his reader into the
mood for further pathos. You are quite
prepared t© learn that the girl has changed
her mind, and is going to marry the bloke
who stayed at home. But you are not pre-
pared for the giim Australian joke that
closes the yarn like the brutal slash of a
whip. Yet Brewer has got you in his
grip; the the suggestion in
the last paragraph is ’ irresistible. Maybe,
in printing it here—a shockingly unfair
thing to the author —the reader will merely
smile: to get the full flavor of the thing he
has to let himself be led blindly right up to
the edge of pathos. But here it is :
“And as the girl waited, she toyed with a
white feather which she at the first public
opportunity, as a patriotic girl should do,
would present to some miserable coward or
other who was shirking his duty to the coun-
try.
Nora Kyffin Thomas proffers Shi Sonnets
for Is. (Hussey and Gillingham, Adelaide;
the proceeds to reinforce the Red Cross
funds). She makes of the word towards
two syllables, accented on the last; but as
the latest dictionary allows the poet ample
choice of pronunciation between tords,
towrds (accented on the first syllable),
twords and to-wbrds (accented in the manner
of Nora Kyffin Thomas), she is possibly jus-
tified. (Any controversy on this important
matter must be withheld until the R.A.A. is
constituted, when the Australian Academy
will settle this important point by the issue
of a ukase.) Another sonnet has four rimes
in the octave and other irregularities. That
leaves four —3d. each. And worth it. Here
is her pleasant and delicately atmosphered
“Silence in the Bush” :
Hidden are all sounds; even the ceaseless
rain
Falls with so soft a touch upon the earth
That scarce she murmurs; it is as though the
birth
Of some new, delicate thing that long had
lain
Under the gentle earth loosed a refrain
Of silence lovelier far than song, more worth
Than subtlest melodies or sweetest mirth.
And in this wondrous stillness the soul’s pain
Grows faint and fainter, and the heart
Knows peace. A red-breast on the wing, a
flower t
With rain-dewed face, and all hushed things
impart
A fragrance to the wondering air, and power
To heal — for, lo! the spirit of the wood
Has caught them in the net of his high mood.
Yes, this page knows that the sonnetess
has ended with a rimed couplet, but She does
that in all her sonnets. Maybe, that’s a
habit in Adelaide.
WAR.
I am a woman of Belgium, old and alone!
All those icho loved me are dead, and our
home!
See here the ashes!
'That day they shot him, my husband sobbed
as he saw me
Watching him die — alone, my grey hair
blowing in the wind
That whistled through the market-place.
My eyes tearless.
We had a girl-child. (Thank God she is
dead!)
Young she was, like a flower,
Eyes like a dove,
And mouth always laughing.
She teas the loveliest baby, and slept on my
heart every night .
Her flower-mouth
Burnt at my breast as she drank at the fount
of my life;
And noio she is dead! Gold hair and virgin
face
And dove’s eyes wondering at me when I
stabbed her
With the sabre I snatched from the soldier
who looked at her with German eyes;
If Was just in time!
I can hear her scream yet
As I cleft her girlish body.
She died at once before she saw what the
soldiers did to me, her mother,
In punishment that my dead was virgin!
That is against the rules of war.
I cut off her hair ere they buried lief.
Finer than silk.
Spun gold.
Hers, my little dead baby's—the one who
slept on my heart
And drank at the fount of my life —
Her floiver-mouth burning my breast!
I am alone and old,
A woman of Belgium!

Autumn Nights.
Come out. come out to the ight with its
stars,
And the maid-moon slim and sliy ;
The trees on the hill stand out like spars
On the cloudless rim of the sky.
Come out, come out to the scent of the rose,
To the fragrance of dew-moist earth ;
A breeze from the grass through the border
blows, •
And the bell-flower quivers with mirth.
Come out to the curve of my arm, to the
kiss
That wakens love-laughter notes,
While, born in the night, of your hair, for
bliss,
A gold moth quivers and floats.
Come out, come out (little love, be wise!)
To the night and the starlit hill;
The dew-drops gleam, and the maid-moon
dies.
She is coming! O heart, be stilt.

Fans.
The wind of fans comes down the years
And rouses from the Past
Dead women with their hopes and tears
And charms that could not last
An amber-bodied slave girl, laid
Beside a fountain in the shade,
As underneath the leafy screen
She makes-believe she is a queen,
With gentle play of ivory fan
She borrows while her mistress sleeps,
And, in her vision’s caravan,
Pride, like a camel, ever keeps
The richness of her fancy’s load
Above reality’s rough road,
Till she comes to the gateway, where
A dreamland Sultan waits for her.
Or else some noble black-browed dame
Who loved a slave herself, and can
Not crush hc-r wild desire, though shame
Has made her hide behind her fan
The hungry burning of her eyes;
She bites her pillow where she lies
And stretched along a leopard skin
Scorns the desire —but hugs the sin
A fair Circassian, latticed tight,
Teases the parrot in his cage,
Fan folded in her fingers white,
Jeers softly at the fluttering rage,
And very beautiful and bored
Awaits the coming of her lord,
Leaving the parrot to his ease
When she has something else to tease!
An English oueeu upon a throne 7
A mighty fan of feathers wields;
In dungeons foul her prisoners groan ;
She hears the clash of conquering, shields
And through the costly feathers’ sway
She tries to plan some better way,
And wishes that a queen could part
The queen and woman in her heart!
A wanton by a churchman’s side
Flickers a fan of scarlet, set
With diamonds, and that fan sweeps wide
Across the land, and "wider yet;
The while the dimpled hands of her
Proclaim themselves the arbiter —
Its downward sweep a courtier breaks,
Its upward lift a monarch makes !
A heavy fan of tortoiseshell,
With small medallion Cup'ds graced,
Becomes the dark signora well,
With sticks Cellini might have chased;
Forgotten in a hasty flight,
Flashed on a jealous husband’s sight,
That monogram of gold and jewel
Has stirred a breeze that brought a duel.
The paper fans of old Japan,
Black flirting fans of Spanish belles....
Dreams... .In ray fingers is a fan
Whose baffling fo'ds no story tells—
Frayed silk.... where still old roses glow.
And all I longed the most to know
Mocks me. half whispered down the wind,
Of that old fan you left behind !

The Dominant Cry.
We have left them behind us, but ever
From the hills that stoop low to the sahd
And the rocks that would frown them to
silence
They call from that desolate land.
Through the rear of -the gathering tempest,
And the moan of the clamoring sea,
O’er the bird voices, shrill and exultant,
( They’re calling to you and to me.
Not the dew-spangled glance of the dawning,
Nor hush ’neath the eve’s lonely star,
Nor night with her memories brooding
Can silence those voices afar.
The summer sea mocks them, triumphant,
Fast bound in a shell-riven sod,
But high on the wind-wings of winter
They cry to a listening God.
We have left them behind us, but never
Shall falter that dominant cry,
Till the Cross of the Stars from the South
Lands
O’er the Crescent in triumph shall fly!

Are Your Tyres' Under-sized
by "Two-Passenger-Weight?
MEASURE the Cross-Section Diam-
eter of your Tyres when new.
. If they are millimeter FABRIC
Tyres, and not GOODRICH Millimeter
Tyres, you will find they are seriously
Under-Sized.
That Under-Size interprets into less
Air-Space than the millimeter specifica-
tions of your Tyre calls for.
For instance —you’ll find the “regular.”
so-called, “815 x 105 m/m Tyre actually
measures only 815 x 96 or 97 or 98 or
99 or 101 m/m (according to make)
when you receive delivery of it.
S*S s{: ❖
A FULL-SIZED “810 x 100” Tyre
( up-to-specification) would, for
instance, carry 2900 pounds of
Car and Occupants; —at 70 pounds Air-
Pressure —with a correct flattened-to-the-
road section of Tyre not exceeding 14%
of the Tyre Cross-Section Diameter.
But a “regular” (or UNDER-SIZED)
Tyre of this so-called “810 x 100” size,
measuring only 810 x 92 1-5 m/m, with
same 70 pounds of Air-Pressure —and
same correct flattened-to-the-ground-con-
tact-of-14%, would carry only 2523(6. of
Car and Load.
That 377 pounds less carrying capacity
is equivalent to the average weight of
about two passengers, in Car.
* * *
TO compensate for such Under-Sizing
of “Regular” Tyres you would have
to do the following :—•
In order to carry the additional “Twor
Passenger-Weight” represented by the
Tyre-Shortage—-on the proper 14%-of-
Cross - Section - Diameter - contact - with -
ground—you would have to increase your
Air-Pressure, in the Under-Sized Tyres,
by more than 17%.
Thus, instead of a sufficient 701 b. to
the Square Inch, you would have to
carry 82 pounds pressure.
If you failed to do this, with the full
load, you would Wear out your Tyres
about 25% faster than they should wear
—through the Result of excessive flatten-
ing in contact with the road.
This translates into a tangible count-
able loss, representing about '25% less
Mileage from your Tyres, or 25% of
what they cost you.
sjs *
AND Lo ! —When you do increase
that Air-Pressure by 12 pounds
(or more than 17%) this happens:
You thereby increase the Vibration to
such an extent that you approach the
Uncomfortable Action, and Disastrous
Result to Cai’, which would be paralleled
by riding on Solid Rubber Tyres at 40
miles per hour, over a rough road.
There is a ready remedy at hand for
this condition!
All millimeter FABRIC Tyres except
GOODRICH are UNDERSIZED—as
the Calipers or any standard Scale will
prove.
But, Goodrich FULL-SIZED Tyres
cost you no more than same quality of
other metric Makes — all of which are
UNDER-SIZED.
Now what Remedy does this situation
suggest?

THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF
RESPONSIBLE PERSONS.
Fluting the happy hours away immediately
after the elections, inspired Fusionists ex-
plained at great length that their win repre-
sented “a victory for Govern-
ment” —that hereafter public affairs would
be in the hands of men answerable to the
electors. In a dim, remote sort of way there
may be some truth in this, for all Govern-
ments are in a sense responsible to the people
for the things they do and the things they
leave undone. The constitutional theory of
the business is that if the electors come to
the conclusion that the Ins have been playing
the goat, and making a hash of the joint
and several job, they may by a majority-vote
fling a sufficient number of the muddlers off
the premises to give the Outs a chance of
being responsible. Having done this they
still retain the privilege of doing it some
more. Wherefore the story is a long record
of exasperated electorates discovering that
the last persons they made responsible for
certain work had behaved with such cheerful
irresponsibility as to demand either the imme-
diate application of the boot or a vote of
continued confidence. The choice between
these two things depends upon whether the
crowd yearning on the doorstep to be made
responsible seems likely to be more or less
calamitous than the others. This is the
main reason why one crowd always yells
“No” when the opposite side says “Yes,” and
is systematically affirmative when the other
is negative—why those who are not respon-
sible fill the air with clamorous denunciation
of those who are responsible, Party Govern-
ment being based upon the doctrine that the
responsibility of any given set of men con-
sists of either proving that the others are
disastrous messers. or forcibly preventing
them being anything else. And so it pans
out that a politician is, its a general _ thing,
only responsible for his irresponsibility.
When it is found out that he is not fit to
be entrusted with responsibility for 2d. any
longer, there is always open to him the
chance of being considered the very indi-
vidual the community is looking for to show
that the other chap is about 10 times more
unreliable. Party Government, resting in
theory upon a fiction, has in practice turned
Responsible Government upside down by
destroying the responsibility of Parliament
to itself and to the people, and by establish-
ing a cleavage, on one side of which irre-
sponsibility is flagrant, and on the other side
is merely concealed by pretence. Taking a
broad view of Australian politics, a very
great majority of Ministries have depended
for their existence and rested their hopes of
further existence more upon the extent to
which they could claim the license of irre-
sponsibility than upon their acceptance of
a responsibility that, in addition to being
constitutional, was actual and moral. The
last Federal Parliament afforded a shocking
example of this. The last State Parliament
in X. S. Wales was irresponsible right up to
the burial service.
Strip away the constitutional jargon from
the doctrine of Responsible Government and
see how much real responsibility there is
for anything. Sixteen years ago the Com-
monwealth took over the Northern Terri-
tory. Since then Ministries have come and
gone, and the two parties on the see-saw have
at different times been made responsible for
that locality. The result? All The
Bulletin or anyone else knows is that
money has been tossed into the place _in
barrowloads and the job of doing something
that matters is still undone, and everything
connected therewith a shrieking jest. To
speak merely of “failure” in connection with
the Territory is to use the language of
anaemia. The place stands to-day a ghastly
monument of blighted hope and broken
promise and Heaven knows what else
besides. Who has been responsible? As
well ask the nearest gohanna as the
Federal Parliament! How, where or when
have Ministries shown realisation of their
responsibility? Ask one party and get a
deluge of words. Ask the other and get more
words. The plain truth is that Ministries
have been irresponsible in relation to a
problem crucial to Australia —have by this
irresponsibility lulled the nation into a
drunkard’s sleep. And the problem to-day
looms in a new setting—that of a mighty
task before a nation where “Responsible
Government” is so irresponsible that it can
let the job go to the Devil. Take the Aus-
tralian Defence Department. In constitu-
tional theory the Governments and Minister
entrusted with the administration are
responsible to Parliament and to. the electors.
Is there any intelligent citizen prepared to
argue with The Bulletin that this is not
a dangerous fiction —that the Department
lias not been, and is not to-day, administered
with as much irresponsibility as if it were
a mere figment of imagination due to vanish
the day after to-morrow? Who was Pearce
responsible to yesterday? To Labor! Who
is he responsible to to-day? To an amor-
phous Fusion ! And what do these answers
mean? Less than nothing! Archibald
made a disaster of Canberra. His adminis-
tration was a shrieking jest. But he was
a good and faithful hack ; and when Hughes
formed his Ministry Archibald’s shocking
failure as an administrator counted for so
little that he was actually made Minister
for Trade and Customs. Have a look at
repatriation and try to find out where signs
of the personal responsibility of the sup-
posedly responsible Minister can be dis-
covered in relation to that. A couple of
years ago N. S. Wales started to grow
friendly with Norton Griffiths and Co.
From this friendship sprang a contract —
such a one as Antonio made with Shylock.
Before it, all other smells bolted into the
interior. And the end of the yarn was
Responsible Government buying its way out
with £300,000. Who was responsible for
that disastrous incident in the bright, young
life of the State? Are they still being
responsible, or does anybody care?
* * * *
Party Government is not responsible, or
anything like it. Nor can it ever be made
so. And it is as certain that Party Govern-
ment will ruin this country if it gets a long
enough run, as it is that under its blighting
influence the national ideals and social hopes
of the Australian people are rapidly perish-
ing. That in N. S. Wales the people
responsible for the Norton Griffiths con-
tract should be still in public life is scan-
dalous. The fact that they are is a sharp
reminder that irresponsibility can be carried
with impunity, even with profit, to the point
of license. That the Federal Parliament
should for three years have sat mute in
its party chains enduring Pearce as Min-
ister for Defence makes mockery of even
an academic claim by the Legislature to
responsibility. Parliament can never be
responsible to the people until it is first
responsible to itself. Ministries can never
be responsible -when the irresponsibility of
Ministers suits the party ends, nor until
Parliament insists upon a personal and col-
lective responsibility. Up and down Australia
of recent years and recent weeks there have
been revelations of squandered money,
muddled administration, ineptitude and folly,
all carried to the last possible degree. The
findings of Royal Commissions have only
givep point to common knowledge. What
protection have a plundered people had from
their Parliaments, in which places-of alleged
responsibility have too often been purchased
by an irresponsibility that has debauched
the citizens with their own purse? It is
well within the limits of strict and easily
ascertainable truth to say that Australian
Parliaments, and particularly Australian Min-
isters, are the most irresponsible institutions
and individuals in the Commonwealth. No
party can plume itself on being better than
the other. Each is bad—its record shame-
ful. Irresponsibility can be both active and
passive, and of both forms Australia has
had more than enough.
If responsibility, being too heavy or
unpleasant, is dropped by all hands, and no
one knows where to look for it, the proceed-
ings are reasonably certain to end in chaos
extending far beyond the walls of Parlia-
ment. Now, the obligation on a self-gov-
erning people is, for their own salvation, to
make "responsibility for mess and muddle and
wooden-headedness a real thing—to pin
responsibility down to a fixed address and
treat the irresponsible disease in the same
way as plague.
WHY NOT AN AUSTRALIAN
CONVENTION?
The liish Convention, through which Eng-
land. at the instigation of Lloyd George,
hands the problem of 800 years over to the
people most concerned, has a good and whole-
some look; and there is more than a sport-
ing chance that the end of the long struggle
is at last in sight. The guff with the threat
of fight which Orangemen have poured into
English ears would be too ridiculous to repeat
in an assembly of Irishmen: the views of
extremists on the other side would want a
solid backing of argument before those who
have to carry the responsibility of national
decision would listen to them. More than
this, the voices of men other than profes-
sional politicians are to be heard; and it is
these voices in serious explanation and
appeal that are likely to dominate the gather-
ing. Without in the least shaking oid con-
victions, new angles and viewpoints are
likely to be presented until the aims of
divergent factions are shown to be identical
and a compromise as to machinery becomes
easy. The public will not be listening to
the process by which finality is reached;
and only the word of the Convention as a
whole will go out to the world. The right
of free suggestion from any quarter will
carry the discussion far beyond the bounds
of questions that have hitherto been recog-
nised as planks of party platforms; and Ire-
land may easily step forth at the conclusion
to a new marching harmony such as she has
never known since the days of Henry
Grattan. But even if things go wrong and
the Convention is a partial failure, something
will have been accomplished, and the sphere
of contention will have been narrowed by a
better all-round understanding of the national
problem.
tt * * *
The idea of such a Convention is not
wholly new. What novelty it has lies in the
fact that it has been deliberately brought
forward by a British Prime Minister as the
best expedient by which a difficult problem
may have a chance of solution. Whatever
the result' the idea that an assembly of the
men who represent a nation’s best and keen-
est thoughts and desires should once in a
way be called to advise Parliaments and set
new currents of endeavor running in new
directions is worthy of consideration as
an adjunct to the machinery of democ-
racy. The thoughts of the Parliamen-
tarian move within a narrow sphere. Those
of the man in Ministerial office are even
slower and more restricted. So a non-
political Convention such as that which is to
be appointed to save Ireland might render
splendid service in any country where there
are pressing problems and the needs of the
future are insistent. Australia at the
present moment is in desperate need of a
policy—a real policy, broad and sound and
supported by the intelligent will of the
people. But such a policy is not likely to be
formulated by the fag-ends of parties now
in office. Immense and pressing needs of
this continent have from time to time been
lightly set aside by successive Governments,
and the lack of ability on the part of legisla-
tors to suggest new paths was pitifully in
evidence at the recent election. Yet Aus-
tralia^ —the real Australia, which exists in
spite of all the froth and bluster —is earnest
enough about facing the future, and fertile
enough in suggestion. That such earnest-
ness and fertility should lie idle merely
because W. M. Hughes is winning the war
in noisy periods, seems sheer waste of good
material. To use it to the best advantage
would not delay the victory of the Allies by
an hour, while it would, beyond all question,
give the Commonwealth new heart and hope
to have some sort of settled policy and to
know that our national aims and ambitions
had not come to a dead-end.
The constitution of the Great Australian
Convention could be as wide as that pro-
posed for the Irish one. Prominent men of
all sections of the community ought to
attend. Many who could not afford
the time to enter politics in the
general way might be willing to sacri-
fice their personal interests sufficiently to
attend the Convention. Labor should have
its full quota there; all the professions
should be represented ; the manufacturer and
the importer and dealer should argue beard
to beard ; the man with a cow and the man
with only a cat and a backyard could com-
pare notes; and Bung could meet the
Umbrella of reform in the full blast of
debate. Bring them all together and shut
the doors! Let no whisper of the things
said within the hall of meeting come out
until the clear light dawned upon those
within. In such a gathering the boss poli-
tician w r ould find rhetoric of no avail. On
facts and arguments his case would be
judged; and face to face with those who
knew and who were in earnest about their
knowledge the real weight of the supposed
leader would be easily apparent. The I.W.W.
person, stating his case in cold blood before
the man he wanted to bomb, would realise his
absurdity ; the Tory, rising with a hoary gag
to lheet the plain facts of a plain case, would
see that the difference between himself and
the I.W.W. propagandist was merely one of
method. There would be some noise and
confusion at first, but it would soon die out
as the debates moved on and the contro-
versies turned around new and unexpected
suggestions. Out of the great mass of matter
which would surge through the joint mind of
the Convention certain points would begin to
star themselves as vital; and the men who
had come to the gathering with fixed and
unalterable views oh what they conceived to
be the total possibilities of Australia would
find themselves looking at new things and
strangely in agreement with their supposed
enemies. At last the doors would be thrown
open and the findings of the Convention
would be given to the public—a policy repre-
senting real Australian thought. It would
be just such a tonic as the Commonwealth
needs after the dreary dead-level of 17 years
of party politics; and out of it should spring
a closer nationalism and larger ideals for
the future. At any rate, it is up to politi-
cians who cannot shape a clear course for
themselves to give it a trial. If Ireland has
need of such a Convention, the Australian
outlook demands it not less loudly.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wounded Billjim—What About Him?
Next time a politician is heard blithering
about repatriation in terms of farms and
ploughs and cash for men who are sound
in wind and limb it will be up to some
decent Australian to interrupt the proceed-
ings with a demand that the orator shall cut
out the wind and forthwith explain exactly
what has been done, is now being done and
is to be done in future, with the man repatri-
ated with a missing limb or a perforated
lung. The repatriation problem hinges upon
this man. and most of the loud, clamorous
talk about somebody else is simply vote-
catching and therefore indecent. Either the
Federal Government recognises that to the
soldier whose efficiency has been impaired the
community owes a direct obligation or it does
not. If it imagines that this obligation can
be discharged by giving such a man a pen-
sion, then it ought to say so. If it does
not. then it ought to say what is being done.
But it will not give this latter information,
because to do so would be a confession of
failure to recognise the decent thing. What
is taking place is little short of scandalous.
When men are brought back wounded to.
say, Sydney, they are, of course, treated
for their injuries. When it is con-
sidered that they no longer need med-
ical attention they are paid off and perhaps
granted pensions for varying amounts.
Meanwhile the great majority of them
have lived in idleness, more or less, for
though nominally under military control they
have been practically free. The whole aim
and object of the system in force is to patch
them up, grant them a pension, and get them
off the establishment —quick. It works out
right enough in some cases. Very little in-
vestigation is needed to show that in a great
many more it works out all wrong—that
many of these men are being utterly demoral-
ised before their discharge, and a consider-
able number of others put on the road to
demoralisation later on. The pension is
right and proper. But it is not enough.
Through physical and perhaps mental impair-
ment thousands of our men will be unable
to follow their original callings. What are
they going to do? If the idea is that they
should be encouraged to live in indigence on
their pensions, or eke out their incomes by
annexing odd jobs, then it is a rotten idea,
even looking at the thing from the point of
view of the men themselves. An idle man.
even if he have only one leg or a mutilated
arm, or is short of an eye, is a miserable
man. He may easily become something
worse. In every other country engaged in
the war the closest attention is being given
to the job of helping men wounded or other-
wise damaged by service to retain their sense
of usefulness to themselves and to others.
Why not in Australia?
The Simple Job of Doing Some Work.
It comes from Carson this time: —
We have been living in a fool’s paradise in allow-
ing the resources of the Empire to be used foi
strengthening our enemies and forging weapons
enabling them to fight us.
This is the easy thing to say—and being
easy has been said a thousand times. But it
means very little. In Australia the people have
heard the same sort of remark every day
for the best part of three years, the essence
of the sermon being that the Germans had
been engaged in some kind of base con-
spiracy against the Commonwealth —that
when the German bought Australian wool
and metals and apples and handed out
chemicals and electrical equipment and
stockings and frying-pans they were sever-
ing the bonds that bind the Empire or com-
mitting some other disreputable offence. It
is mere cowardice to blame the Germans.
We are to blame, not they. The German
came to Australia because we made room
for him. We gave him leases of our best
quays and wharves. He ran his steamers
to Australia because Australians wanted
what those vessels carried and travelled in
them in preference to British ships. He
bought Australian wool and worked it up
because Australia preferred to hurry it
away off the jumbuck’s back without further
attention. We sold him raw metals —and
deliberately starved our own works. When
we did not actually hand him opportunities
he seized them while Australia slumbered;
and the problem now is whether the slumber
is merely being interrupted, and whether
someone else is going to do for Australia
what the German did before. If this is the
case then there will merely have been a shift
from one pax-adise or hell or whatever it
may have been to another. What will it
avail Australia if instead of acquiring ship-
loads of Australian material via Hamburg
they arrive from Timbuetoo? It is all very
interesting to bowl about last, week and pull
up upas trees and discharge mouthsfull
of wind at the Germans. But what about
next week? The thing that matters is the
shirk and the dodge and the greedy scheming
of Australians. These are the things out
of which the fool’s paradise was created:
and if the country is not purged of them,
all the lamentations about the wickedness
of other people are going to be of no more
service to us than a meal of shavings.

Idle Millions.
A couple of months ago The Bulletin
suggested that an effort should be made to
employ some of the many millions of money
that was lying in the banks of Australia on
current account, large quantities of it merely
for safe keeping. The banks are not using
this money to any extent —they know it
would be unsafe to tie it up. The owners
are getting nothing for it—they are content
to have it kept for them till the clouds roll
by. Meantime the nation is hungering and
thirsting for money; and large sums are
being spent in scraping together the people’s
savings, which are being borrowed for as
little as thi-ee years. Since the suggestion
was originally made, another lot of quarterly
banking averages have been published. As
at March, 1917, there were in the banks of
N. S. Wales alone no less than 45 million
pounds on current account. This was over
15 million pounds more than were on
current account deposit in the January-


March quarter prior to the outbreak of war.
Deposits at interest have also increased, but
by only two millions. The problem is how
to make better use of that 15 millions which
has been added to current account since the
war began. The banks cannot be expected
to lend it. As a matter of fact, though there
has been a good deal of loose talk to the
effect that these institutions should have
subscribed for more war loans, they
have done very well indeed, consider-
ing the terms on which they hold
the hulk of their money. We don't want
a financial crisis and bank smashes on top of
the war; and that’s what the banks are
properly guarding against. But that extra
15 millions of current-account money ought
to be doing better work. Nobody is benefit-
ing sufficiently by it at present—owners,
banks or public. It ought to be possible to
evolve some form of special war deposit, for
one, two or three years, the money to be
used only for the purpose of financing war
loans. There are surely hundreds of indi-
viduals and institutions—insurance offices
and the like —that are prepai*ed to put their
nexf three years' savings or accumulations
into war loans. These war deposits could be
used to finance those purchases, to the great
advantage alike of the lenders, the borrow-
ers and especially the Commonwealth.
The Queer Anxiety to Acquire a
Smitten Cheek.
At an inquest on the remains in Sydney
the other day, one of the defeated Labor men
“regretted that Labor did not go boldly
before the electors as an anti-militarist
organisation.” This sort of talk can do
Labor about as much good as a course of
strychnine. With such a basic faith, its
case against compulsory service would be,
not that voluntary enlistment was better
than conscription, but that enlistment of any
sort was an abomination. In the judgment
of The Bulletin, to advance this theory
would require considerably more boldness
than many Australian citizens would care
to be identified with. Anti-militarism as a
working policy for a people who wake up
m the morning to find that unless they have
a punch on the premises the enemy will be
inside the front gate by lunch-time, is about
as useful as a wooden leg to a man without
a vacancy to accommodate it. The plain
meaning of the anti-militarist doctrine is
that the world’s democracies should bow
their necks before the militarist —that the
mailed fist should punch its way through in
any and every direction. Applied to Aus-
tralia it would mean that if an invader
arrived he should be presented with resolu-
tions protesting against an unwarrantable
interference with the liberty of the subject.
How many Australians would put up with
that means of defence? If the answer is
that anti-militarists do not object to de-
fending their own country, then the reply
makes hash of the whole anti-militarist
theory.
Slumdom and Bumbledom.
Only by doing great violence to the views
of its more landlordly members did Mel-
bourne City Council, which deliberates in a
chamber like unto the temple of Solomon,
and relegates the recruiting depbt to its
dank. and windy catacombs, decide to spend
£•>o in helping along the town-planning
conference and exhibition in Adelaide next
August. A loud, shocked shout, “There are no
slum areas in Melbourne !” greeted Councillor
H. H. Smith's assertions that the city
should seriously consider town planning, and
that 764 houses in 1915 and 1045 in 1946
presumably in the slum areas—had been
condemned. Councillor Shillabeeb pro-
tested in a bruised tone that most of those
houses would be repaired and made habit-
able, and Councillor .T. G. Airman, the
super-draper, declared that Melbourne streets
could not be altered, and no planning could
be carried out in the city. Apparently
Airman does not know that the City Council
has power to acquire slum areas compul-
sorily, and put the land to whatever use it
pleases. By operating an Act passed only
last session it could clean out at once the
slums and drums of the alleys behind Lons-
dale-street east and Latrobe-street east, and
erect factories which would gladden even
Airman’s eye. No slums in Melbourne?
What of Surrey-place, Casseldon-place, Finn-
place, and half a dozen others to which the
Age recently devoted a scathing column and
a half? Here is a little of it
Off Queensberry-street there is a 12ft. lane leading
into a whole labyrinth of narrow streets and blind
alleys, scarcely one of which is more than 14ft. in
width. Little Queensberry-street so doubles upon
itself that it is front and back to the same houses.
It contains a nest of slum dwellings, one or two of
which have fallen to pieces, or have been demolished.
The ruins are left to rot on the allotments they were
built upon. Some of the best of the houses actually
possess front “gardens,” Bft. is a fair average size,
and then, of course, the tenants have to pay for the
luxury by having Bft. deducted from what would
otherwise be a l6ft. backyard. The typical house in
such an alley is a wooden structure, of four or five
rooms, often not more than 9ft. by 9ft.
This area is within the municipal jurisdic-
tion of Melbourne City Council. And here
is another democratic vista :
Magenta-place, off Lygon-street, at its entrance is
about 10ft. wide. In the labyrinth of lanes it is
difficult to know where the backs of the houses in
this alley open upon. Poultry, dogs and children
make it a busy little thoroughfare. Magenta-place
opens into Little Cardigan-street, which starts with a
width of little more than Bft. Off Rodney-place, on
the other side of Lygon-street, is another network
of narrow lanes acting as frontages to rows of cot-
tages. The lanes average from 10ft. to 15ft. in
width, and act as washing-yards, sitting-rooms, play-
grounds and rubbish-tips.
It is not proposed to send pictures of these
places to the Town Planning Conference.
But photographs of their landlords should
certainly be on exhibition somewhere.
Black Brother and the Law.
The administration of the Law in the
Northern Territory must be inquired into
with the other things. Recently a nigger,
one Romula, objected to the usual white
having the usual Territory lien over his
missus, using, allegedly, a little arsenic to
convince the white man that the lady was
not common property. Allegedly, as a result,
a number of people were nearly sent west.
The inevitable inexperienced J.P. travelled
some hundred miles, sat in judgment, and
handed out six months each to two abos.
(what for is not clear), and committed a
third for trial on a charge of attempted
murder by poisoning. Then the thing began
to smell. (Remember all the time what the
black man’s grievance was.) Romula was
presented in the old way, and though every-
thing was well staged, he spoilt the
climax by pleading “Not guilty.” Apparently
Judge, Crown Prosecutor and counsel
(assigned) for prisoner were all nonplussed.
A second request that the prisoner should
be asked to plead again brought forth the
same firm plea, “Not guilty.” Then the case
was passed over and another one proceeded
with. Next day Romula filled the gap while
a jury on a murder case retired to consider
its verdict. This time his Honor looked at
prisoner and said, “Well, RomulaV” and.
after a breathless pause, Romula said “I
bin do.” The Judge: “I think, Mr. So-and-
So, we can accept that as a plea of guilty.”
And that was the end of it. Now, this “boy”
undoubtedly had a good record —a splendid
record —and was often left in charge of the
station. Why, then, did he attempt murder
by poisoning, assuming he really did itV
Why? Ask the authorities. Ask the boss.
They know. No right-minded jury in the
world would have convicted that abo. on evi-
dence. Anyway, to test it, Romula had
every right to be tried on his first and
only plea—“ Not guilty.” Where was British
justice? Even a Hun would have got a
trial. But the nigger—well, he was a nig-
ger and he knew things. So Romula got five
years—only five years for attempted mur-
der by poisoning. Again, why? If he was
guilty what was wrong with penal servi-
tude? Is there any difference between mur-
der and the attempted murder except the
result? What did his Honor think? The
sentence answers that for itself. And
what happened between the time when
Romula surprised various people by saying
“Not guilty” and his muttered “I bin do”?
The last public inquiry into administration
in the Territory was farce where it was not
tragedy, and should itself be the subject
of inquiry. No repetition of it is wanted.
But there is a job of grave public import-
ance waiting to be done. A Higgins could
best do it; no Higgins being available, at
least a Wilfrid Blacket should be sent
armed with plenary powers of inquiry.
Annexation and Effective Occupation.
Tiie question of annexations after the war,
which is worrying the new Russian con-
science, and through it the statesmen of most
allied countries, opens up the old inter-
national argument about effective occupation.
Germany, before the big guns started the
murder-concert, had a considerable string of
colonies, but any claim that she was effec-
tively occupying them might reasonably be
disputed. In one or two the exploitation of
nigger had gone some length; in others there
was only a military establishment of a kind ;
in none was there any serious attempt at
German settlement or any considerable num-
ber of permanent German homes. The real
German colonies are in British or American
countries, not in the places where the
Kaiser’s flag used to flap. While Australia
has no desire to permanently hold the por-
tions of the Pacific from which our troops
hunted the Teuton early in the war, it is
unthinkable that these places should be
handed back merely to form a war base for
possible future operations against ourselves.
If the hot and generally unwholesome spots
in question could be run on some inter-
national basis for the benefit and not the
exploitation of brown brother who really
owns them, no question of annexation need
enter in. Samoa, where the native is mild
and pleasant, and the spirit of R. L. Steven-
son still lingers, might do very well under
thp supervision of Maoriland, with the same
sort of rule as that which the Cook Islanders
seem to rather enjoy. But Samoa has
scarcely the military importance of .some
other spots. Where Australia’s protest must
come in, even against the yoice of human-
ised Russia, is with regard to strategic hold-
ings. The man who wants an acre of soil to
grow food has Australia’s sympathy; the
one who wants an isolated rock on which to
mount a gun we must still regard" as venom-
ous. And somewhere about here the shame-
ful neglect of alleged patriotic leaders to
make our own occupation of the Northern
Territory effective calls again for the half-
brick of outraged Australian sentiment. We
don’t want the Territory merely as a place
to mount a gun; but we may have to mount
more guns there than there are official re-
ports on the possibilities of the region if the
promise is not speedily redeemed to give the
country to the Australian people by a direct
South-to-North railway.
o
A Growl from the North.
Jas. A. Walker writes it:—
The Australian taxpayer down South should know
that all the experiments tried so far in the Northern
Territory at his expense are simply a repetition of
those made privately years ago with disastrous results,
and records of these, I understand, were available for
the present generation to be guided by if they felt
disposed; but, apparently, this generation had no
time to read. The result has been an extraordinary
waste of public moneys without any tangible result.
In fact, there is nothing to show for all the trouble
and expense but isolated buildings, decaying plant
and sueh-like.
Much sympathy must be extended to the unfortu-
nates who were willing to accept the generous invita-
tions thrown broadcast to come and settle on small
areas in the Territory and who have lost nearly their
all. Being guided by what they took to be absolutely
reliable information some.of them sold out their hold-
ings south before they realised what a hopeless
prospect they had in front of them. Cattle-rearing
is the main hope for the Territory for long to come.
Since Vesty Bros, took to the Territory, their
seemingly unlimited wealth has made a great differ-
ence. Their vast purchases of country have changed
a few struggling cattle-rearers into men of means
and otherwise added prosperity. How long it will
last is another question. The excessive demands of
unions, the employment of lazy foreigners—mostly
Greeks—the heavy expenses for material and the
avoidable shortage of fresh water for the works, all
tend to make the business somewhat of a gamble. Why
the works were erected where they are is a puzzle,
seeing that there is no holding country for bullocks
and almost no fresh water available all the year
round. There are numerous sites far better than
the present one, and only a very indifferent know-
ledge of the country would account for the present
site.
Mining is under a cloud in spite of the high price
of metals. Labor and materials cost too much. There
are one or two base-metal mines struggling on with
the few Chinamen left: but as these aliens are weak-
ening with old age and no more are allowed in, the
mines must close down soon. The average N.T. mine is
very patchy. The rock face is very much fractured,
as diamond drilling has proved during the last 12
years, and this does not indicate permanency of veins
and deposits. The general experience the last 40 years
has been very unsatisfactory. No doubt English cos.
15 or 16 years ago helped the industry's downfall
by their absurd extravagance.
Coming back to the climate, the Territory is as
good as any place in Australia. Certainly the
heat is very trying at times in low-lying Darwin;
but as you go inland you climb steadily—something
like four or five feet on the average to the mile—and
there you have the real Territory.
Hughes’s Luxuries Board looks suspiciously
like an underground or backstairs Tariff
Board, save that its decisions won’t have
the latter’s guarantee of reasonable per-
manence. “If the Board is of opinion that
the importation of any particular class of
goods should be prohibited or restricted, and
that the production or manufacture of that
class of goods in Australia should be in-
duced, encouraged or stimulated, either by
payment of a bonus or by any other means,
the Board may make a recommendation to
that effect.” It is beautifully vague and
loopholey, and typical of Hughes’s habit of
thought. But supposing the Board recom-
mends the encouragement of the manufac-
ture of motor-cars by a progressively in-
creasing duty, or the production of cotton
by a similarly rising bounty, of what avail
will it be if the whole arrangement falls to
the ground six months after the war is
over? It simply means that those Mel-
bourne and Sydney storehouses now stacked
to the roofs with imported motor-cars will
make a big additional profit—which the
Win-the-War Government will doubtless
make haste to collar. Of course the Board
may not do anything of this sort, but if it
doesn’t it will merely accentuate the sus-
picion that it isn’t intended to be a Board
at all, but a Stall.
A cable floated hither from London the other
day asking the Dominions to prepare launch-
ing-places for aeroplanes. It’s a great world
to be alive in, after all! The aeroplane
evolved by warfare is the sort that can prac-
tically run itself; it will be safer than a
motor-car, and suffer much less from tyre
trouble. Already in the IJ.S.A. a flying
limousine is on sale: it is merely a dainty
motor-car with wings. It can leave the road
whenever the surface gets bad. and cut out
all the curves. After the war we shall
almost certainly have a passenger and mail
service per aero-bus with England. Lord
Montagu, lecturing at Delhi, explained
one scheme. Passengers and mails would
first be carried by aeroplane to India,
a distance as the aeroplane flies of
11600 miles. Travelling comfortably a
mere 10 hours per day, and stopping
an hour for lunch, passengers would
reach Peshawar from London in 59 hours.
That is calculated on the present war-
speed of 120 miles per hour. If you pre-
ferred, you could go via the All-Red route on
your way back, spending the first night at
Basra, the second at Alexandria, the third at
Malta, the fourth at Gib., arriving in London
for tea the next day. The mail aeroplane
express would, of course, run a practically
non-stop journey, day and night. On this
India route 10 aeroplanes per day would
carry 140 passengers, or about 1000 passen-
gers a week, which is more than the average
now carried by steamers. The fares would
be low, considerably less than those now
charged by steamers, since there would be so
few meals to provide. On present appear-
ances, a good profit might be made by fixing
the single fare at £4O. But India would be
only the first stage on the air-route to Aus-
tralia. The mails would come via Peshawar.
Calcutta, Rangoon, Singapore, then by sea-
plane to British North Borneo and on to
Queensland. As for landing places, there
will be no difficulty about that. In fact,
aeroplane-landing places are yet one of our
great natural resources.
The main thing about “the soldiers’ vote”
is that it is a fact. All the explanations
that may be made of what happened leave
the thing itself unaltered. Labor got a
heavy wallop, and in the circumstances this
is what counts. It is not likely that the
general result of the election would have been
affected in any way by the polling of Bill-
JIM, even if his vote had not been jerry-
mandered. The Conscription vote he cast
settles that point. The side with the loud-
est whoop for war could naturally expect to
get the support of a very substantial majority
of the men actually on the job. But that
the huge vote for Phewsion represents the
measured judgment of the army upon the
events of the preceding two or three months
in Australia is incredible. To suppose that
soldiers 10,000 miles away had a working
acquaintance with even the foundations of
Phews would be to imagine a vain thing.
The very voting paper put before them was
itself proof that the compilers thereof knew
the men were voting, if not on the blind, at
any rate with an amplitude of misinformation
which would be of no disadvantage to Phew-
sion. That voting paper was a scandal.
Australia has heard the result of the trench
vote. There are quite a lot of other things
to be heard later on about it and the
preliminary dope.

Now here is a chance for Archbishop
Mannix to show that he has got Australian
interests at heart. If he can’t do the job,
nobody can, so the whole responsibility is on
him. This is the trouble. The new R.C.
College at the University is, according to
present arrangements, to bo fitted with Man-
churian oak, in spite of protests made by
patriotic Australians who believe that there
are plenty of better Australian timbers. At
the first annual meeting of the Australian.
Forest League the grouchers did their mani-
fest duty. Among them were timber-expert
Vincent Trapp and W. R. Grimwade, of
the wholesale-drug brotherhood. Trapp men-
tioned Queensland maple as a suitable
article. “Why,” snorted Trapp, “you might
as well compare a cab-horse with a racehorse
as set Manchurian oak up against Queens-
land maple. And Queensland maple is
cheaper, too.” Grimwade, for his part,
testified that there was enough fully-seasoned
Australian timber in Melbourne, of the right
kind, to fill the college contract 30 times
over. The deal had, however, been put
through before these particular protests were
recorded, the college committee and its
advisers having decided that Australian
woods of the required standard were not
available. But that shouldn’t end the matter
for a reputed fighter like Mannix. Here is
the allegation that an inferior timber is
being imported to Australia to be used in a
building to be paid for with Australian
money; and this passing-over of Australian
timbers is likely to do a serious and quite
undeserved injury to Australia. That is the
position Mannix has to face; and The
Bulletin will be interested to watch how
he does it. Or whether he will do it at all.
Many farmers are in a bad way through the
Commonwealth Government taking over the
whole wheat crop at its own price and fixing
its own time for paying up. In Melbourne
the Stock Exchange has come to the rescue
and has established a regular market for
wheat certificates —really the Commonwealth
Government’s lOU’s. This at least gives
the cocky a choice between a parasite with
a moderate appetite and a parasite with a
ravenous one. Actually in Sydney, where
there is no open market, circulars have
been issued inviting moneyed people to
buy wheat certificates, offering to nego-
tiate the purchase, and holding out a solid
expectation of a profit of at least fid. on an
outlay of Is. Id. Further, of that Is. Id.
there will be a payment of fid. in August.
Still, though the cocky knows he is being
mercilessly bled, be simply has to get money
somewhere: and the banks are not lending-
on the certificates. The Government which
commandeered all the harvest at its own
price and fixed its own time for paying ought
to have seen that Cocky was financed, as
the Egyptian Government did with the rice-
farmer. But as long as the middleman and
the parasite have a good time the Australian
Government seems to be quite satisfied that
it is a statesman.
“Kerango”: “Splendide” (B. 26/4/’l7) is
on the right line when he draws attention to
loss of Post Office revenue through prema-
ture introduction of penny postage, cheap
telegrams, etc., but he should have added
lettergrams to his list. These ’grams were
introduced to afford the worker a cheap ser-
vice and fill in the night operator’s purely
imaginary spare time. The worker, how-
ever, makes very little use of this service;
but the wily business people hold back their
less important telegrams during the day and
load the wires at night at 40 words per shil-
ling. The night telegraphists are always
kept going solidly on press and urgent busi-
ness, and as lettergrams are not handled
until press and other traffic is clear, the
operators are almost invariably detained
beyond their schedule hours to handle
“sweatergram” traffic. As Ifi words for 9d.
or Is. have proved an unpayable proposition
in the past, how on earth can the revenue
be increased at “sweatergram” rates when
telegraphists handle these messages at
overtime rate of pay? Some of the
firms try to “ring in” two separate
40-word messages to the same addressee
for 2s. instead of one 80-word message
for 2s. Bd. Allowing for number of
words in the second address they would pro-
bably save 4d. or thereabouts on the trans-
action. Fortunately, this “doubling up”
is not permitted by the Department. But
when the messages are lodged at different
times the mean dodge is not always detected
by the counter clerk.
The Path of the Proud.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Laughing-eyed lord of the wide-flying wings,
Yours to have looked upon soul-stirring
things—•
Valleys of Death and the anger of Kings!
Oft have you watched through the tremulous
stays
Balls of white smoke on the blue of your
ways
Break, with the muzzles beneath you ablaze.
Oft have you trodden their trail underfoot,
Dipping and daring the marksmen to shoot,
Dropping your bombs as a tree droppeth
fruit.
Yours was a flight beyond fears that assail,
Poised like a god on the crest of the gale,
Cloaked in your courage as knights go in
mail.
You that have bathed where the star-river
runs,
You that have ventured the sea of the suns
High above hate and the hunger of guns,
How will you suffer earth’s roadways again?
Slow feet in woodland and pasture and lane?
Slumbering waggon and loitering train?
Every keen wind in those whispering spars
Echoes the clang of the armor of Mars,
Calls you again to the cloud and the stars.
So, when the guns are grown silent at last.
Anger and hate in the world over-past.
Yours but to answer the call of the Vast.
Yours but to point her blunt nose to the
breeze,
Set her sure engines a-hum like the bees,
Lifting again to the cloud-billowed seas.
Eyes shall grow dim as thev follow your
flight.
Gone like the wild-geese that fade in the
night,
Climbing the slope of the Uttermost Height.
Vainly our beacons shall beckon and burn.
Vainly our eyes shall be strained to discern
Wings in the distance that mark your return.
One with the silver that edges the cloud.
One with the rose where the rainbow has
bowed.
Thus shall you pass—on the Path of the
Proud!

The War and Holiday Arrangements.
One of the arguments advanced to justify
the application of compulsory military ser-
vice to Australia was that the war demands
the help of every man capable of bearing
arms—that hope of defeating the German
by anything less than the maximum effort is
a dangerous delusion. Nothing has occurred
meantime to even cast suspicion on the
accuracy of this. On the contrary, the
events of the last few months make that
maximum effort seem more indispensable than
ever. The main argument put forward as a
stimulant to voluntary enlistment has
hitherto been that men are urgently needed
to reinforce the troops already in the field—
that unless the wastage is repaired the Aus-
tralian divisions will fade off the landscape
or be split up into other divisions. And
nothing has occurred on any of the numer-
ous fronts to suggest that that argument has
lost its cogency. Yet Defence Minister
Pearce has now come forward with an idea
that 5000 men should at once enlist in order
to give 5000 of the men already at the
Frojit a chance to he brought hack to Aus-
tralia for a holiday. Pearce’s notion may
cause a rush for khaki. This paper hopes
so, anyhow. But it fears there will be no
rush, and, if there is not, it suggests that
Pearce should consider the advisableness of
prosecuting himself for supplying arguments
to the enemies of recruiting. Are reinforce-
ments so easily got that 5000 men
can be pulled out for eight or nine
months? It strikes The Bulletin that
Pearce is only, as usual, piffling with
his subject; because there is a certain
measure of sentimental attractiveness about
the idea, he acts as if it were practical and
expedient. But the holiday-making aspect
of the war is of less importance than any-
thing on earth. It is the critical and
desperate nature of the struggle—the fear-
ful consequences of failure —that need
emphasis, and they cannot be given too
much. Recruits are wanted to fight for the
freedom of the world against a tyranny
potent still for terrible evil. To vary the
yarn is to fool with the truth. The war is a
long way from being won, and unless a hole
is put in the German it will not be won.
Australia’s future and the future of every
Democracy oil earth is horribly uncertain —
more horribly uncertain than it was when
the Conscription Referendum was taken,
because if one of the Allies has not already
fallen down she is in as unpleasant a mess
as the human mind can imagine. These
circumstances form the crux of Australia’s
military problem, and Pearce ought to be
told to concentrate on policy founded on a
reasonable comprehension of the business in
hand.
«
When the Australian troops burst in the
door on Fritz in the islands to the north
there were some German postage stamps in
a drawer in the post office. These bits of
paper were promptly made into loyal British
labels by printing “G.R.1.” on the face of
them; whereupon that mild but wealthy
person fhe stamp collector rushed the things
as treasures of great price. The speculation
in the cheerless goods was keen; and while
some heroes in uniform got into trouble over
them, other adventurers in shirt sleeves and
inkstains gaily forged them in corners of
printing offices. Now, after a lapse of many
months, the Commonwealth offers what is
left of the things for sale. It seems like
playing it rather low down on the specu-
lator, the thief and the forger—not to men-
tion the mild stamp collector who is more
or less the victim of all three. Had the
stamps been marketed when the craze for
them Avas raw and new, there would have
been little to snort about; but the spectacle
of this Commonwealth manufacturing curios
and then deliberately holding its own manu-
factures for a rise is rather paltry business.
Richard Deanis Meagher, Lord Mayor of
Sydney, again this Aveek applied for re-
admission to the Bar. and three Judges of
the Supreme Court unanimously said No.
Jim Gannon, K.C., for the applicant, made
the best of a bad case. But the Court was
right. For it to give assent to the doctrine
that, because a man achieves “eminence” in
politics he thereby establishes a claim to
restoration in a profession he disgraced,
Avould be monstrous. And even on the poli-
tical side all that Meagher could truthfully
say is that in his time he has belonged to tAvo
political parties, and that neither of them
Avill OAvn him now.
♦
The Yic. State Recruiting Committee re-
signed last Aveek and it really doesn’t mat-
ter. Hardly any body that could be
appointed to replace it could do worse.
Three months or more ago this Avas quite
obvious; yet there was the usual yelp of
official protest as soon as this paper started
to make some plain remarks about recruiting
in Victoria. Meantime Australia is still
Avaiting to hear from Hughes how he pro-
poses to win the Avar. Only in one Avay can
the war be Avon —by men. If Hughes has
no plans for gettioig men. then Australia
will have >to think out a plan of her own.
And she cannot afford to waste time over it,
either.
S. M. Herald (sermonises the manufac-
turer :
If the manufacturer seizes his opportunity he will
gain in Australia a market from which, after the
war, it will bo very ilitlicult to displace him. The
buyers will have got more accustomed to Australian-
made goods, and if these goods are any way near
the quality of what were formerly imported the Aus-
tralian manufacturer will keep the trade. It is an
opportunity that will not recur, and it. will have
more effect in stimulating local production, if pro-
perly utilised, than a dozen tariff amendments.
Perhaps. But the Australian manufacturer
isn’t likely t> plunge merely on the strength
of the protection afforded by the war —which
may end at any time. And he wants some
guarantee that he will get a fair deal in the
commercial war that is going to follow. He
knows now that Germany doesn’t stick at
a trifle to get its own way. Further, if the
Australian manufacturer is going to have
the trade, what is the objection to a tariff?
If a man isn’t gofing to have any more
whisky, what does it matter to him if the
whisky is locked up?
Travelling by rail is the favorite exercise
for mice in S. Aus. now that wheat is being
removed, as much as possible, to the com-
paratively unplagued sea-coast; and mouse-
slaughter is the prevailing sport at the re-
ceiving end. Port Adelaide has claimed the
record with 1100 killed for one truck. But
Terowie —where ti“anshipment from narrow
to broad-gauge railte has to take place—says
that is a trifle. It has butchered 1100 from
one truck, but reckons that, being still new
to the game, it allowed more than four times
as many to get away.
At Bimbi, near Rorbes (N.S.W.), Button-
shaw, newly-elected M.L.A. for the Lachlan,
asked if any local affairs needed attention.

two inches of rain.”'
"Outchline”: The, effort to form a second
Vic. Public Schools unit for the A.I.F.
recalls the history of the first, which was
the F company of the stli Battalion. It
was recruited by Capt. H. Carter, an old
Wesley Collegian, and was subsequently
amalgamated with another company and
eventually distributed. There were origin-
ally 119 of them, including three officers.
Thirty-seven, nine of whom transferred
to the British Army, have gained their
stars, and 25 of the privates their stripes.
Casualties have been: Killed, 25; missing.
1; discharged (wounded or sick), 23. Of
the 70 still on service, only eight remain
privates. The M.C. lias been won by Major
N. Marshall (son of Dr. Marshall, of Scots’

“G.M.”: I went into a Sydney Chinaman’s

a small bag they W'fint. Then four bananas
and two peaches into the same bag. Fearing
an accident I said, “Put ’em in a bigger bag,
John; I gotter go long way.” John didn’t

Miller Wilson, contractor, will be more
careful before he accepts the next fool’s
word. When a tra!in on the North-eastern
line (Vie.) pulled utp the other night some-
one in the carriage told him they were at
his platform. Unhesitatingly he opened the
door and stepped out—into 60 feet of space.
The train was standing on a bridge! But
Wilson’s luck turned as he was on the way
down, and he landed on his feet in the soft
clay bed of the Broken River. He thus
escaped with a strained back and a cut lip.
“0.K.”: Went to hear Adela Pankhurst
speak in the Melbourne Socialists’ Hall, a
.barn previously devoted to boxiug, and one
brief time the residence of Chinese opera.
Comparing Adela with bygone entertain-
ments in the same building—especially the
Chow musical drama—l wanted to throw a
tomato at the verbose little woman, who
now talks so fast that a hasty word
is apt to fall over another in front
of it. And it all amounts to nothing.
You ask yourself—what’s the idea? Adela
was understood to be addressing a mixed
audience on “Politics, Women and Flec-
tions.” Often, however, she forgot herself
and addressed the crowd in a very familiar
manner as “girls.” This I objected to.
because I was one of the few who had
dropped threepence in the collection-plate
before going in, and I didn’t feel a bit like
a factory girl being lectured during dinner
hour. There was no sort of bite in the
address. Apparently there never is any bite
in Adela. Before the war, you remember,
the best she could do was to help Yida
Goldstein talk franchise to a sex that had
already got it.

At Melbourne Majesty's last Saturday,
when the curtain fell on “The Three Twins’
and was raised again in response to the im-
perative vegetable tributes, Miuuie Everett
was brought on. She had arranged the
ballets, groupings and dances, and was the
nearest approach to an author that the pro-
gramme disclosed. “The Three Twins ’ is,
in fact, the ancient farce of “Tom, Dick and
Harry,” revised on musical-comedy lines and
embellished with a hard-working chorus and
a peal of electric bells, which are let down
from the l'oof instead of being fixed into the
front of the d.c. The musical numbers are
modern American variations of composite
melodies that sound like echoes from the
caverns of memory, and are associated with
a sudden darkening of the stage and tableau
illustrations.
The incomings of the festive chorus _ are
mostly as irrelevant as a whisky advt. in a
temperance bar. Anything, indeed, might
happen during the frequent interruptions of
the plot of this artless old narrative. If
Dorothy Brunton were to sing about an
Indian prince one would expect to see a
black man riding on an elephant to lend
verisimilitude to the ditty. The most imagi-
native piece of illustration that actually
occurs is a vision, let iuto a fugitive back-
cloth, of a young lady in skin tights whose
left embonpoint is pierced by an arrow. She
pops up incidentally while Greene is singing
a song of farewell to Bachelor Days, and
she probably means that his bride-elect was
appearing as a lady acrobat when Cupid’s
dart struck home. Dorothy Brunton has a
couple of pleasing invertebrate songs which
are even more profusely chorused than
Greene’s; and Maude Fane, who imperson-
ates a damsel with a giggle, lapses into a
ditty entitled “Dreamboat.”
These incidents, and others from the same
factory, are as padding attached to the dry
bones of what was once a farcical comedy.
Tom, Dick and Harry are Greene, Frith
and a humorless third person of lesser
stature, all disguised in grey suits, red ties,
similar boots, hats and identical wigs and

It might as well he extended to embrace the

inconceivable army general who doesn’t know

obvious points of difference, and Workman

Though in the out-of-date comedy, “The

hardly scope for the refinements of her
polished art of pure comedy, the English
actress scores a triumph nightly at Sydney

almost as highly polished.
There is no sign yet of any tyre trouble
developing in the motor-car that conveys
the honeymoon pair to their home in the last
act of “Turn to the Bight” at Sydney

A Bulletin man hopped on one of the
special trams bound for Sydney Agricultural
Ground on Saturday night, and saw the first
outbreak of a show called a “Great Aus-
tralian Round Up.” About (>OOO of the pub-
lic were rounded up quite successfully.
For many weary minutes they just stared
across the large grassy arena that was a
confusing tangle of lights and shadows, and
listened coldly to the thumping of an over-
coated band and the indignant bellowing of
bullocks whose night’s rest was being ruined.
Presently a dashing Cossack raced into the
arena and amused himself by galloping up
and down, occasionally firing a shot at some-
thing or other, or nothing at all. A close-
up view might have been thrilling; but to
the people he was trying to amuse he was
just a mounted shadow fleeing through the
night. Far yells, of protest were heard, and
chilled observers started to light matches by
way of signalling “the Bird.” The desperate
Cossack stood on his head in the saddle.
Still the little flames of protest leapt up.
“What yer doin' over there?” roared an im-
patient spectator. The Cossack rode round
the ring and galloped Qti. Then a very
small girl in a white dress climbed on a
piebald pony far out in the ring and went
round a saucer track in time to the band.
The polite grandstand applauded, but the
rude bob-ites roared in the distance and lit
more matches. When the buekjumpers were
brought on there were a few fitful moments
of excitement. But to get the full thrill out
of buckjumping a close-up view is essential.
To the massed thousands in the distance the
careful saddling of a dimly-seen, bag-blinded
animal was as dull as the third reading of a
Bill in Parliament. So The Bulletin left
and found the exit crowded by other people
who were not willing to wait in the cold
and see the donkey race, the “scene of early
settlers’ hardships” or the big bush-fire. It
might have made a daylight show for chil-
dren, but it was no success as a long-range
night entertainment for grown-up citizens.

We concluded before the war that our civilisation would still

motah-car simply yearns to take soldiers for
a drive on days when the sun is behaving
beautifully. On Saturday the bill will be
“A Little Bit of Fluff,” described as a
screaming farce in three acts.
Melbourne Princess’s, closed for five nights,
reopens on Saturday with a first matinee
performance of “Joyous Jones.” George
Willoughby runs the co. and figures in the
name part, Jones being a musical edition of
the bagman who used to have things Happen
to him in his previous existence.
“The White Chrysanthemum” blooms at
Melbourne King’s on Saturday. Lupino and
the rest of the “Very Good Eddie” crowd
are to appear in the new musical extrava-
ganza that cometh up like a flower, and
Vernon Irving makes his Australian ddbut
with it.
The most passionate thrills on Hoyt’s
Melbourne screens this week are an up-to-
date war drama and a filming of “The
Jungle,” wherein Marion Swayne makes the
most of things. Olga Petrova, as the star of
the other picture, plays a war-bride who.
torn by conflicting emotions, gets herself
sevei’ely disliked for not doing what she
ought to have done. The nervous tension is
relieved by an assortment of minor pictures.

At Melbourne Tivoli the last nights of
Ada Reeve and Co. are stated to be rapidly
approaching. Meanwhile the winsome little
artist speaks just as cleverly as she sings,
and her stage appearance has receded from
something under 40 to something over 20, as
the result of her broken foot being now
almost quite well again. A little further
improvement will restore her to her teens.
The Britannia (Melb.) picture of the
moment is “The Iced Bullet.” a Sherlock
Holmes-like drama put into dream form, by
way of apology for the splendid audacity of
its plot. Next week Billie Burke revisits
the Britannia screen to run the last lap of
“Gloria’s Romance.” At the adjacent Melba
the Fox Triangle picture, “Shell 43,” is the
trump card for the next three days.
Adelaide amusements have suddenly taken
an Australian turn, with the old Kelly tra-
gedy at the Tivoli and the new Waybacks
farce at the King’s—reopened for the occa-
sion. Judgment reserved in both cases. The
Bunyip panto, is nearly due at the Majestic,
where for the moment the cheerful Leonard
Nelson takes the audience into his confi-
dence, and the Human Frog turns himself
inside out, and the Bentleys bang the xylo-
phone—a popular turn. At the Royal comic
opera is doing astonishingly big business.
But “The Cinema Star” is not a great piay,
and Phil Smith and Florence Young and
Roberts and Holland and Gladys Moncrieff
work hard on very moderate material. Inci-
dentally, Minnie Love really ought not to
be allowed to drag “The Broken Doll” into
this play. The more pathetic it is made —
and she sings it very well —the worse does it
go with her part of the comic female who
boasts of her appetite and calls the other
fellow a dirty dog. The instantly and enor-
mously successful feature is the dancing of
the new recruit, Clyde Cook. Wondergraph
has been filming “Oliver Twist,” and West’s,
in a big bill, find nothing goes better than
the detached motoring episodes of “The
Scarlet Runner.”
“The Old Soldier”; Abdul may be the
“clean-fighting Turk” sometimes, but, know-
ing his habits, I’m not surprised to read grim
tales told by British prisoners of war:—
They have perished by the roadside of hunger and
thirst. Some of the survivors are known to have
been left to die of cold in unhealthy prisons, where
they are denied garments, medicines and the ordinary
necessaries of life.
The Turk has always been a conqueror and
devastator, and a destroyer of civilisation
wherever he has found it. Hulagu, the first
leader of the Seljuk Turks, laid waste Irak
and Syria, and destroyed the Saracen civili-
sation of Baghdad. He destroyed some eight
millions of peaceful people, but wept when
he heard of his brother Mangu’s death.
Hulagu and Mangu would have called them-
selves Eslci Turan (Old Turks). Timour.
who followed them from Turkestan, was like
them, for he raged over Asia Minor, and put
back civilisation three centuries; yet he
was very kind to the people who survived
the passage of his armies, and treated the
Seljuk Sultan Bayazid as well ns Enver
Pasha treated General Townshend. The
Turk isn’t bad in spots; but the spots are
too far apart, and you can never depend on
hitting one.
Dr. Charles Todd, who died suddenly at
59, while on a visit to Victoria last week,
was the eldest and only remaining son of
the Charles Todd who had a great share in
laying the transcontinental telegraph line
from Adelaide to Darwin, and afterwards
settled down as P.M.G. and Astronomer of
S. Aus. Dr. Charles had no hobbies beyond
his profession. He went round the world
recently, gathering information on the hospi-
tal question, and was to take a prominent
part in the reconstruction of Adelaide Hos-
pital, to which he was honorary surgeon.
Charles Goode opened a new wing of the
Blind Institution in North Adelaide last
week. At the same time he was reappointed
by the A.M.P. Society for a further term on
the S.A. directorate. It happened to be his
birthday—only the 90th.
Lieut. It. G. Howell-Price, killed recently
in France, aged 21, was the youngest of five
Australian brothers —sons of a Sydney sub-
urban C. of E. parson—who answered the
call. Another was the late Lieut.-Colonel
O, G. Howell-Price, D. 5.0.. M.C.: others
are Captain Philip, D. 5.0.. Captain Fred-
erick P. (army), and Lieut. John, D.S.C.
(navy).
Lieut. J. It. Nunn, who recently died at
Rand wick Military Hospital, was the cadet
who represented Glen limes in London at
the coronation of George V. He went with
the First Expedition to New Guinea, came
home, got his commission, and moved on to
Gallipoli, where he was mentioned in dis-
patches. After repulsing an enteric attack
he went to France, but was never himself
again and was finally invalided home to die.
The local Labor League is putting up a
candidate for a seat in the Fitzroy (Vic.)
Council. Ilis name is John Chandler, and he
is an engine-driver. A wealthy Brunswick-
street ironmonger, who started pt t-and-pan-
ning 30 years ago, and is now the best-
known man in his trade throughout the
State, is also a candidate—and his name is
Daniel John Chandler. There is no connec-
tion, family or other, between the two men—
it is just one of those stupid and unnecessary
coincidences which the Fates arrange in an
odd moment when they have nothing worse
to do.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Ami”: The curtain rustles down for R.
S. Smythe, at 85 —the cheery little man about
five feet high. A native of Lambeth, London,
he was apprenticed to a firm of printers as
reader-boy and went through Dyce’s Shak-
speare, Timbs’s “London Curiosities” and
some of Carlyle’s books, his companion as
reader being F. Greenwood, founder of Pall
Mall Gazette. Early in the ’so’s he came
to Australia to dodge consumption. The
voyage set him right, so he took up journal-
ism first in Melbourne and then in Adelaide.
As entrepreneur lie started with Poussard
the violinist and Douay the ’cellist, and
piloted them for five years through Aus-
tralia, Asia and South Africa. Mrs.
Smythe, who survives, was) the vocalist; she
was Miss Amelia Bailey. Smythe was the
first to take foreign artists to Japan and
the Hill stations of the Himalayas; also he
was the first impresario to cross the Orange
River into the Transvaal. After some Aus-
tralian concert management he discovered
Charles Clark as lecturer —and after that
things were comfortable.
Harold Ashton left £1033 in real estate
and £7160 personal, all to his brothers.
“Norbell”: Years ago I barnstormed with
the late Wilson Forbes. Once at Colac
(Vic.) the house was small, and so was our
chance of seeing the ghost walk. Forbes, as
the heavy father, had to say to his stage son :
“Ah ! You are a good son, George!” That
was all; but his passion for improv-
ing the occasion got the better of him,
and he proceeded: “A good boy. When a
reputable theatrical company comes to your
town you patronise it, for you love his-
trionic art and clean, wholesome drama. Yon
are not like the young men of Colac, for
example, who prefer the public-house, the
billiard-saloon” and so on by the gallon.
At last a bored patron interjected “Rats!”
Wilson Forbes shook his leonine mane, glared
out at the bob seats and thundered:
“Silence, you supercilious, grovelling muck-
worm !” That settled it —and us.
“Futsac”: Just as the Commonwealth
Censor Board was getting nicely into its
stride it received a cable from the Governor
of Utah, asking for the prohibition of a
motion picture which showed Mormonism in
a bad light. Although the Board had pre-
viously passed the film for exhibition, it
decided to hold up the picture pending the
arrival of the full text of the Mormon pro-
test. Now the film people are wondering
how far foreign influence is going to affect
the decisions of the censors, and whether
U.B.A. is to make our opinions of the films
as well as the junk itself.
“Playbird”: Exit Carrie George an old-
time Vic. stage beauty whose finest per-
formance was as the Queen when Louise
Pomeroy kicked off her skirts to play Ham-
let. About 1.880 she left the stage to marry
old Robert Laurence, once an actor ot merit,
but then the licensee of the Nag s Head
Hotel, Ballarat, a real Poverty Point,
haunted by actors, good, bad and rotten, (in
those days Ballarat was a fine show town,
the old Academy of Music, where Bui
Holloway made much money, working almost
the year round.) After the death of her
husband, Carrie was forced to take to the
stage again and toured the smalls. I
reckoned I was getting among the old ’uns
when I recently saw her granddaughter,
Lorna Forbes, playing with Allan Wilkie in
“Richard the Third.”
“Glen H.”: A real hit in “Very Good
Eddie” was. to begin with, one of
Barry Lupino’s impromptus. On the open-
ing night in Melbourne, Eddie Kettle, who is
trying desperately to be a devil of a fellow,
had made his exit, and another character who
should have taken the stage was delayed. To
fill what might have been an awkward gap
Barry Lupino dashed back by way of the
stairs he had just mounted, yelling joyfully.
“I’ve done it: I’ve done it!” He then breath-
lessly explained the nature of his achieve-
ment, furnished proof by hastily repeating
a smoke-blowing operation, and rushed off
again, by which time the delayed mummer
was ready to take the stage. Nothing very
brilliant about the incident, but it was
humorously done and seemed so spontaneous
that it “broke up” the house. It is now
a permanent and effective feature of the
show.
Mardi Dillon, the gushful aristocrat who
makes a pot of the hero in “London Pride,”
is a young Repertory recruit. She was a
very passable Violet Robinson in Gregan
McMahon’s last revival of “Man and Super-
man.”
Ethel Irving’s latest success, “The Double
Event,” has evoked a protest from Nat
Gould, who says this was the title of his
first novel, afterwards dramatised by George
Darrell and played in Sydney. But Nat has
no grievance. There have been nearly a
dozen “Double Event” plays. It is any-
body’s title.
“J.F.H.” (London) : Barrie’s latest joke,
"Reconstructing the Crime,” was played at
the Palace Theatre in the presence of Queen
Alexandra and a crowded afternoon audi-
ence, who passed in £3OOO for the benefit of
a war charity. It is a long-drawn-out skit
on the new American type of play that
works backwards and depicts the bygone
misdeeds of the characters. There is enough
in it for a 30 or 45 minutes’ sketch, but by
stringing it out for more than a couple of
hours Barrie reduced his fashionable audi-
ence to a low level of boredom. Interpolated
was a delightful little ballet—“ The Origin
of Harlequin”—which showed the old whim-
sical Barrie at his brightest. It is the onlv
part of the affair that is likely to be heard
of again. In the end .Justice H. B. Irving
sentenced the various delinquents to appro-
priate terms of imprisonment; then Lady
Tree apnealed to the audience to purchase
their release, putting each one up to auction
m turn. Irene Vanbrugh, Dot Boucicault’s
wife, brought the most—£2o. Much higher-
prices would certainly have been realised if
the joke had not been spun out to such tire-
some length.
“C. Ockney”: Oswald Stoll, one-time of
Melbourne, now emperor of vaudeville in
England, became managing-director of
London Alhambra when the fortunes of
that once-famed song-and-dance establish-
ment were at their lowest ebb. The
cute showman brought back the luck imme-
diately. Now news comes of an action for
damages by a Leicester Square tobacconist
against the theatre in consequence of the
crowds nightly thronging the thoroughfare
outside his shop. The tradesman alleges
that , these interfere with his business.
Justice Neville, in granting an injunc-
tion, remarked that such crowds were
a public nuisance, and that theatres
must make provision for their accom-
modation. Previous to Stoll’s advent a
year ago the Alhambra made arrangements
for the crush, and no trouble was caused.
Now the only thing for the co. to do is to
acquire the adjacent Empire and hold over-
flow meetings, or something, there.

THE VAMPIRE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m quite a simple sort of bloke;
I do not like a naughty joke ;
And for my sins I like to go
And decorate a picture-show.
Frank Morton’s verses give my soul the cramp ;
I don’t drink fiery liquors;
But in the weekly flickers
1 love to watch the vampires as they vamp!
The vampire wears such shocking clothes,
She loves so madly, and she loathes
In such a state of neglige.
I'd like it, say, for just a day.
I’ve never met a female of that stamp.
I’d love the warm sensation
Of Anthony’s temptation—
Where do they keep the lovely things that vamp ?
I’ve searched for syrens far and wide—
I want to know where they reside.
My neighbors’ sisters and their wives
Live simple, non-bloodsucking lives;
None make of love a long seductive pome.
The ordinary flapper
Is crude—l long to slap her!
I want a little vampire in the home!
And though, perhaps, I sometimes think
From their embraces I should shrink,
Their gaze hypnotic and the charms
Of naked, soft and snaky arms
Would doubtless my enthusiasms damp ;
If Fate would only bring some
Impassioned creature clingsome
I’d gladly be the victim of her vamp!
I’d like to have the feeling that
Some vampire in her lovely flat
Should think it worth her while to snare
My soul, and drag it to her lair.
I’d like to let a vampire really go !
I’d love those steeplechases,
Those sensuous embraces —
They cut them oil so quickly at the show !
My wife with me is quite content;
She doesn't vampire worth a cent.
Arid yet there must be lots about,
If only we could find them out.
So in the “Wanted ’ pages I shall seek
Of the Sydney Morning Herald —
I want my soul imperilled 1
I mean to hire a vampire by the week!

The heroine was acted by
A lady stout and staid ;
The house smiled when the villain <ame v

A base proposal made.

But from the gallery a bored
Voice came, which feelingly implored:

WHEN
If fretful, feverish, constipated, bilious
or tongue coated, take this delicious
fruit laxative at once.
The vague, general discomfort of being
“out of sorts,” when the stomach turns
against food, the eye is dull and the tongue
coated and heavy, can be banished in a few
hours by a dose of California Syrup of Figs
—“Califig.” There is no need to put up
with these things until to-morrow, waiting
for bedtime to take medicine. California
Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—will begin to do
you good the moment you take it—at any
hour —and cause no discomfort. This plea-
sant-tasting. refreshing fruit laxative
cleanses the stomach, gently sweeps away all
accumulations of undigested food, and stimu-
lates the liver to assist in reliaiing the
bowels. By evening the tongue win be clear
again and the overflow of bile swept away ;
you will be yourself again, with a good appe-
tite and digestion. This is the medicine
which does such wonders for children of all
ages; but it is every bit as good for grown-
up people, and there are full directions for
every age with the bottle. Take care to buy
the genuine, as there are imitations on the
market. Ask for “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade mark of the California Fig Syrup Co.
All chemists sell “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—in bottles of two sizes. 1/11 and

A COUGH AND COLD SYRUP FOR
CHILDREN.
BITRATE OF TAR AND SUGAR.
What is said to be an excellent cough
syrup—one that is equally effective in
relieving coughs, colds, catarrhal and bron-
chial troubles—is also cheap, and so easy
to prepare that anyone can make a pint of
it at home at small cost by dissolving half
a pound of sugar in half a pint of hot water,
then adding 2oz. of ordinary bitrate of tar.
which can be obtained from any chemist if
you haven’t it in the house. Stir thoroughly,
pour into a pint bottle, and it is ready for
use. Take one or two teaspoonfuls every
hour or two to quickly stop coughs and
relieve colds and bronchial trouble. Half
this quantity should be given to children,
who will be found to be delighted with its
pleasant, soothing taste. — Advt.

SOCIETY
MINCHINBUR[?]
“Gunner P.”: Re par B. 4/1/T7 (sorry
I’m so late, but The Bulletin takes a long
time to get through the wards) on the lady
visitor who turns down the sick man in
favor of the slightly-wounded one with a
bandage visible. When the Queen visited
our hospital a few months back the sister in
charge of a mostly-medical ward knew' what
to expect, so she put bed-cages in some beds,
and bandaged up sick-patients’ heads and
generally made the medical case look like a
hopelessly-mangled hero. Result: Her Maj.
was intensely interested in the ward, _ and
spoke to most of the fakes. But the “medical ’
who wasn’t faked didn’t get a word.
* * * *
The invalided A.M.C. officer's yarn:—
There was an elderly Belgian, a red-hot brother-
liood-of-man Socialist. A wounded German prisonei
1 carved (a decent one —I’m glad I pulled him
through) knew him before the war through their
international delegations.
Well, this old chap was a professor of chemistry in
Belgium, and had a rough time during the invasion,
besides seeing some of the horrors committed by the
Germans on women and men he knew. In time he
was taken away and put to labor. On the strength
of his scientific knowledge he was made to superintend
the sowing of large areas with grain, and promised
to be so useful that he was even allowed to keep
and protect his young daughter.
The crops in, he was brought back and set making
explosives. The strict supervisors there sometimes
caught him making mistakes, and he got into more
trouble through several attempts to get his daughter
away to Holland.
Then one morning he was dragged out of bed and
told he was to be shot, lie didn’t ask why, but was
informed, with bayonet jabs for punctuation, that of
the crops sown under his care none had come up, and
that investigation had proved that he had sterilised
all the seed-grain he could lay hands on. Some left
over had been eaten, and a lot of people had died.
The party that shot him included my German, the
Belgian’s friend.
“And you fired wide, 1 suppose?” 1 asked him.
“Nein! 1 fired to kill! The Professor could see
his daughter... .and officers gathering around her!”
“T.”: The long arm of coincidence has
been a busy limb since the outbreak of this
war. Listen to the tale of Mary. Mary is
a Melbourne girl, but she lived for a while
at Seymour, where she became engaged to
Will. Will is a warrior now and away at
the wars, but while he was in camp lie pro-
mised Mary marriage and many other things.
Mary came to Melbourne to accept a grip in
a city business, and she took up her lodg-
ings with Mrs. Walter. Mrs. Walter is a
grass widow with three children, for Walter
is a warrior, too, and Walter also is off at
the wars. Mrs. Walter advertised for a sym-
pathetic soul somewhat similarly situated to
lie her lodger, and Mary responded. Mary
and Mrs. Walter were excellent company for
each other. Mary talked about Will, and
Jane talked about Walter; and Mary read
Jane bits of Will’s Render letters, and Jaim
gave Mary specimens of Walter’s handicraft
as an own correspondent; and Mary ex-
plained how eager dear old Will was to
marry her. and everything was entirely satis-
factory, until Mary, whose letters were still
addressed to the old pitch at Seymour, re-
SHE MADE A GOOD SHOW.
MAN OF EXPERIENCE: “ She's no actress, you know —just what they call a showgirl.”
THE NEOPHYTE : "And she does — doesn't she?"
NO LAWFULLY WEDDED MEANS OF SUPPORT.
MRS. BUNG: “Yer seems to be fakin' it pretty rough since the missus cleared off,
Barney?"
BARNEY : "Well, it comes a bit hard going back to work after all these years of
married life."
ceived a postcard photograph of Will, and
went in a state of pure girlish rapture to dis-
play her treasure to Mrs. Walter. “Is that
voiir Will?” asked Mrs. Walter. Oh. it was
dear old Will all right. “Then,” said Mrs.
Walter, “you can put off all idea of marry-
ing him while I’m alive.” Men were
deceivers ever. Will is Walter !
The doctors of Tasmania have just won
an easy victory over Premier Lee. After
spending months of unavailing effort to
induce him to reform local hospital manage-
ment, the B.M.A. took direct action by call-
ing its members out of the honorary posi-
tions in the State-aided hospitals of Hobart
and Launceston. The excuse for the strike
was the allegedly unfair use made of the
hospitals by well-to-do people, and Premier
Lee’s disinclination to bar the deadheads.
Disaster to the patients was luckily averted
by the discovery of two or three non-union
doctors willing to take off their coats, pre-
sumably for a hafd-eash consideration. Thus
the B.M.A. has broken down the unsatisfac-
tory honorary system in hospital work, and
at the same time liberated the members of
the association for profitable private prac-
tice. The quaint part of the business is that
Lee is taking credit for his “firm” attitude in
defying the strikers. The fact is, his lack
of foresight in failing to fix the hospital
doctors under a firm contract a year ago,
when medical men began to get scarce in the
island, has compelled him to accept terms
at the point of the lancet, so to speak, and it
is safe to say that the terms are disadvan-
tageous to the State. Meanwhile, the dis-
covery that doctors, like coal-miners, insist
upon a living wage, dirt-money, etc., seems
to have filled the Tories of the Speck with
sorrow and dismay.
“Hussar”: The Japanese haven’t wasted
time in becoming a sea power. My father
—and 1 have not yet touched 50 —-sold them
their first steamship, and that was in the
early ’so’s. A trader in curios, he was known
in Japan, when that country was opened to
foreign, countries, as Muktah Pasha, and
always claimed to have been the accidental
originator of the universal jinriksha, 'which
is quite different from the gin-rikky. He
took an old wooden, four-wheeled velocipede
out in the Ws. It was propelled by hand
and foot levers. A Jap prince fancied it so
much that he bought it for a large sum.
Finding it too much trouble to work in person,
he had it bisected, and, putting a pair of
shafts to each pair of wheels, made his coolies
tow him and the Next Highest about.
The original Tiksha used by Letty Lind in
“The Geisha” was lent by my dad, and was
a very dainty contraption of bamboo, lacquer,
red leather cushions and blue silk hood. He
brought it from Japan in tin 1 \Bo’s. with a
coolie, and drove about Edinburgh in it,
until the dour Scots said he was a cruel man.
It now rests in an outhouse with the fowls.
An indignant J.P. at Richmond (Vic.)
rebuked the accused, who had dealt rather
severely with his wife, a small, helpless-look-
ing creature. “In nine years’ experience on
this Bench,” he said, “I have noticed that
fellows like you never strike anyone who is
likely to hit back.” The defendant seemed
surprised. “Gorblime!” he exclaimed. “Do
you think I leant to be hit back?”
BEARING TUB BRUNT OF IT.
NELLE: “Is he henpecked?”
BELLE: “Oh, terribly! His wife is president

“The Padre'’: This is how the Australian
bush breeds them. He was 19 years old,
farming on the share system ont-baek in
N. S. Wales. The father and mother were
away from home, but there remained two
of his sisters, aged 15 and 12. Mice caused
a fire in the three-roomed hut in the early
morning, and when the lad awoke the place
was in flames. He rushed into the room
where the girls were sleeping, got the eldest
out, and with his night-clothes blazing went
back into the furnace for the younger sister.
She was lying with a fired beam across
her neck. Her brother flung this clear, but
had to retreat without her to the open air.
Filling his lungs, and naked as upon the day
he was born, he groped back into the house;
lint the child was long past saving. The
terribly injured boy then staggered a mile
for help for the surviving sister. When ques-
tioned by the neighbor as to whether lie was
not himself burned, he replied, “Yairs, a
bit.” Actually his shoulders were charred
to the bone, his heels were quite gone, and
he was scorched black. He died soon after
the passing of the sister he had rescued.
THE STORM RIDERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lAs the Australian transports leave Dakar for the
northern run prayers are offered for rough seas as a
safeguard from U boats.]
There’s a road from Dakar Town leading to the
nor'ward;
’Tis a dark and rolling track that holds no hope of
cheer.
Lightless coast and empty sea bid us hurry forward,
But the fair sea mocks at us, and the skies are clear.
Other keels, in other wars, passed where we are pass-
ing ;
Britons marked old Tencriffe, saw the pale stars wake;
Saw, aport, the thunder clouds in the Nor’west
massing—
Knelt and prayed the storm might pass—this for
Britain’s sake.
Thus about the groaning most —long peruke and
feather
Tossing on the rising wind —knelt our sires in
prayer;
‘•God, who ruleth wind and sea, grant to us good
weather,
Fill the sails with homing winds to the, haven fair!”
Now the low moon laughing swings, and the stars
troop over;
Mirrored on the shining sea drifts our lazy smoke.
As a qiiiv’ring beast far driven from old haunts and
cover
Watch we for the hidden trap or the flashing stroke.
Low moon waiting to betray, snuffling breeze behind
ns,
Low stars on a laughing sea, ill they cheer our path !
Could old Neptune but awake, and arising find tis
Victim for his curbless team to trample in their
wrath !
Rise, old sea-god, from your eaves! Here’s sport to
your liking!
Send the. white-plumed ranks afield, let the trumpets
blow!
Storm upon us as of old you bore on Greek and
Viking—
There is peril in your smile they dreamt not long
agol
Thus we pray for Britain’s sake, stealing darkly
nor’ward ;
From the troop deck and the bridge lifts the silent
plea:
“God of battles, who hast bidden Britain's sons go
forward,
Send for guard against the foe the fury of the sea!’’

A couple of months ago a number of
Broken Hill hotel servants who had obeyed
.-•n arbitration award were most cruelly pre-
vented from getting employment by the local
Miners’ Association, which disapproved of
the award. One woman, full of fight, sued
the responsible officers of the big union, and
was awarded substantial damages by Justice
Pring and a Sydney jury. The defendants
appealed to the Full Court, which decided
that the Judge’s directions were good and
the damages not excessive. The Broken
Hill A.M.A., being flagrantly soul-less, is
understood to be now taking other measures
to defeat the law and cheat the wronged
woman out of her damages. The proposal is
that the A.M.A. shall join the Federated
Mining Employees’ Association, the idea
being to slide the assets into the common
fund of the Federation, leaving the plaintiff
nothing to levy upon. However. Considine.
M.H.R., was one of the defendants; and even
if his salary is tied up. it may not be so
easy to get. the assets out of reach as those
in the conspiracy hope for. The Law should,
in any case, see that it isn’t flouted. In
view of the comments of the Judge it is the
plain duty of the Government to see that
that verdict is satisfied.

A note from George Fitzpatrick, sec. of
the N. S. Wales Voluntary Workers’ Asso-
ciation :
As you know, the Voluntary Workers’ movement
seeks an outlet for practical patriotism, whereby
men and women can show by the erection of homes
for disabled soldiers or soldiers’ widows just
exactly how patriotic they are—whether they are
patriotic to the extent of giving eight hours’ labor,
eight shillings or eight pounds.
Although the association is little more than a year
old, already nearly one hundred places are in various
stages of erection, and over £50,000 worth of homes
have been erected- —created out of time which was
hitherto given to recreation or pleasure.
In connection with the association there are no
wages, salaries, travelling expenses or emoluments of
any kind. The whole of the work is done volun-
tarily, the Government providing the necessary
clerical assistance, stamps, stationery, etc.
Of course the association wants money; and
if anyone who is interested hasn’t money to
give, the association will be found quite
ingenious enough to suggest some, other form
of assistance if it is communicated with at
Eastwood Chambers, Elizabeth-street, Syd-
ney. To the practical patriot who is already
sick and tired of the politicians’ windy talk
about repatriation, this Voluntary Workers’
Association ought to make a strong appeal.
There is something, thank Heaven, more
than windy talk about providing a cottage,
rent free, for the soldier who comes back
blinded or crippled for life, or for the sol-
dier’s widow who is left with sad memories
and halfdozen young children.

“Nemo" : Since the middle of last century
—nearly 70 years ago—a site for an R.C.
college has lain vacant at Melbourne Univer-
sity. Now, for about 44 years, R.C. primary
schools have been scattered over Victoria
and maintained from private purses. A lot
of non-Catholic people can’t understand this
apparent anomaly. The
first reason why the
lI.C. college was not
built was that the
late Archbishop .T. A.
Goold wanted to pay for
his big cathedral on the
Eastern Hill, the like of
which great stone struc-
ture does not exist any-
where in Australia.
James Alipius thought
the cathedral of more
immediate and general
importance than the col-
lege. lie had St. Pat-
rick’s in East Melbourne
for the higher education
of his boys, and he
thought that served the
time —and so it did.
YVhen ,T. A. Goold passed
away, T. J. Carr came
on, and he finished up
the cathedral, except the
spires. But those prim-
ary schools had still to
be seen to and paid for;
so Thomas Joseph
couldn’t touch the Uni-
versity building either.
Year by year, however,
hopes were cherished that
the University College
might be begun, and men
used to be pointed out as
likely professors, among
them the Rev. David F.
Barry, who was a Vic-
torian, and was educated
in France. But now there’s a new arch-
bishop ; and as he naturally wants to do
something to be remembered by. the college
at the University is to be pushed on, and
there’s a great stir over it.
Before Solomo n.
“king” of the Largkias
(the Port Darwin
tribe), made recent
tracks for the un-
known, he complained
of the treatment meted
out to his peop 1 e.
Their hunting grounds
had been taken from
them, and they did
not get a fair deal in
return. The old man
therefore threatened
to come back as a
spook and make
trouble. Two hours
after he died a cyclone
struck Darwin, put
boats on the rocks,
blew roofs off houses,
uprooted trees, and
sent galvanised iron
sailing around like
leaves. Rain fell at the
rate of a deluge, and.
generally, things were
upset. “Solomon bin
promise ’em all right!”
remarked a larraba
who had been shelter-
ing in a hole in the
rocks. And when the
larrabas learned that
the storm had not
blown a house on the
white man they dis-
liked most, they pro-
mised that the old
chap would make a better try next time.
“Bad Australian” is emphatic:—
I am right in saying that South Americans are
the most persistent cigarette smokers in the world,
aiid I am also correct in stating that they show no
visible signs of permanent or other injury caused by
the practice. George Newberry, the Argentine avia-
tor and all-round athlete, who won the world’s record
for altitude in 1914, was a confirmed cigarette
smoker, and Santos Dumont, another S. American
whose lungs have stood the test, doesn’t turn up his
nose at the Brazilian eh ala. The army of gauchos
which accompanied the Great Liberator, San Martin,
when he crossed the Andes and chased the Spaniards
out of Chile and Peru, also stood a good lung test.
They hauled their cannon and equipment up preci-
pices and over glaciers across the Andes (13,000 ft),
dropped down into Chile and fought and won tin-
memorable battle of Chacabuto against the splendidly-
equipped, well-fed and highly-disciplined 1-egu.lav
troops, and occupied the capital, Santiago, in less
than a month after leaving- Mendoza. The Northern
Division of the army, which crossed in three sec-
tions, each by a different pass, numbered 1430 men,
under Commandante Don Manuel Cabot, and in tlic
official list of supplies the following items appear:
100 head of cattle on foot, 72cwt. biscuits, 2ewt. salt,
40 gallons aguardiento and 30001 b. of tobacco.

of their descendants to-day, but it didn’t interfere
with the business they had in hand. Where this
is being written—Las Cuevas, Argentina, 10,000 ft.
above sea-level —-I have seen many football matches
(the only British game which has caught on in S.
America) played by Chilian navvies who smoked at
least three or four packets of “fags” every day of
their lives. I quite agree that kids under 15 should
not be allowed to indulge freely in tobacco, any
more than they should be allowed unlimited whisky
or a protracted honeymoon; but that doesn’t affect
my contention that the greater part of the talk about
the injurious effect of the cigarette is just plain
flapdoodle. I was smoking cheap Chinese “fags” at
12 or 13, and am still getting quite a lot of com-
fort out of the pipe and cigarette, and only last
week I was shinning around an Andean glacier
17,200 ft. above sea-level, without any great distress
so far as lung action was concerned.
From London Times (28/3/T7) :
A Well-educated English girl preparing to marry a
squatter in North-Western Australia, would like to
hear from some married lady who has had experience
there, what the weekly routine of a woman’s life on
a lonely station is like —the fashion of preparing the
food, what fuel is used, how washing is done on a
small water allowance, what are the extremes of heat,
and what are the fundamental duties and difficulties;
and what labor-saving appliances can be suggested.
All information thankfully received by Box A. 973,
The Times.
Well, to oblige a lady. The food, particu-
larly during the nullanulla season, is cooked
in “colonial ovens,” which are easily made
after a little practice from imported kero-
sene tins. Fuel is a much easier question.
Tons of lOU’s are obtainable from the
Treasury offices in the villages along the
sea coast. The Government is glad to have
them carted away. Washing is done during
the rainy season, which occurs between
droughts. As for the extremities of heat,
they vary. When the recent general elec-
tions were taking place the heat kept a billy
boiling throughout, except when the Censor
said it wasn’t to boil. There are many
labor-saving devices in the colony, the prin-
cipal of them being that popular implement
the “strike.”
“Kerani” : Yes. Billjim is a good hand at
fighting his way out of a hot corner. One of
my squad (a lad wearing returned colors)
was holding the floor at smoke-oil the other
day, and mentioned that it was only about 12
months since he first enlisted. “Seen much
fighting V*’ asked someone. “Good bit,” he
replied, “on the Peninsula and about
Romani.” One of the boys pricked up his
ears. “But they came off the Peninsula in
December, 1915. If you only enlisted last
year”—— “Yes, that’s what the papers tell
yeh,” said the hero, with all the contempt
of superior knowledge. “ There’s Hanky
troops on the Peninsula now!"

From an Australian in England suffering
from wear and tear in France:—
England is economising, so as to save up for war
loans, etc. Also, it’s economising because it forgot
that it might run out of food. Now, therefore, we have
meatless days and potatoless days, and we’re threat-
ened with fishless days. And a select sub-committee,
consisting- of the Duke of Rutland, the Marquess of
Lincolnshire, Viscount Churchill, Lord Saunderson,
Lord Strachie, Lord Parmoor and Lord Muir-
Mackenzie, has been appointed to consider the re-
freshment question at the House of Lords. People
walk rather than take a ’bus and go out to lunch
rather than have it at home. Every other man you
meet is a Controller of Something or Director-General
of Something Else. There’s a Controller of the Sup-
ply of Periwinkles, and a Director-General of Gorgon-
zola Cheese for Consumption with Counter Lunches.
Here, too, indicating economy in another direction,
are a few extracts from one paper’s “Servants
Wanted” advts.: “One lady, five maids”; “One in
family, four maids”; “Small family, eight servant-.

Last week I had lunch with a “family” of four
(an unmarried man and his three unmarried sisters),
who all talked about the extra penny a pound for
potatoes and the difficulty of geting enough meat .

Sets me staring, as she’s faring,
At her dainty little feet.

That blows into the office
At a minute after nine... .

THE BETTER PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If life feels heavy and luck seems hard,
Take heart and be strong, O brother!
Better to struggle on bruised and scarred
Than to drowse among silks and smother.
If months are many and hard to feed,
Fight on, though you may not fatten:
Better to fall with the men that bleed
Than to rot with the lice that batten.
If joys are few, and you look for death
As something to loose your fetters,
Better to die drawing pure, sweet breatli
Than to live but to poison your betters!

THE RUSSIAN SAMSON (a trifle rattled after his recent exertions): "Seems a nasty friendly sort of bloke: Wonder if I ought to hit him or shake hands.”


THE CAUSE OF INDIGESTION.
Much valuable information may be gleaned
from a somewhat lengthy medical report just
published. For instance, it is made clear
that more than 90 per cent, of all cases of
indigestion, dyspepsia, etc., are due to the
presence of acid in the stomach, and physi-
cians agree that when this fact is realised
by the public they will be called upon to
treat very few cases of stomach trouble, and
the cause of the trouble —the acid in the
stomach—may readily be overcome without
their aid. An effective preparation for this
purpose is said to be bisurated magnesia, and
they advise those who are troubled with
almost any form of digestive trouble to
obtain a small quantity of this product from
their chemist, and take half a teaspoonful
in a. little water after meals, as this will pre-
vent fermentation and neutralise any acid
which may be formed, thus rendering the
food easy of digestion. Certainly this plan
seems preferable to dosing the stomach with
drugs.— Advt.

Solomon the king is dead! The wise old
chap was “king” of the Larakias, whose
tribal district comprises Darwin and all the
region round about. His family name was
Gono-po-beung; his ancestral estates, the
Vernon islands. Solomon looked like a Jew
of the Patriarchal type, and the contour of
his storm-beaten old nut was something- that
Rodin might have delighted to reproduce in
stone. Unlike most Australian “kings”
Solomon never cadged, but like some kings
of a lighter shade he trafficked in dignities.
He accepted a present graciously and
thanked the donor in a way that confei*red

was sovereign when the white-feller first
arrived in Darwin.
If Bigjohn Forrest had known gold in the
raw state when he was out on his ’65 trip
across Westralia, politics would not have
seen much of him. He crossed what was
afterwards Coolgardie, and camped almost
where Arthur Bayley and Ford threw down
their kit the night before they made the
strike of their lives. But he did not know
gold. Had he carried just that much of
knowledge he might have been a millionaire.
Later on he was, with late Brother Alick
and some of the other old-timers of Groper-
dom, in the Wealth of Nations —the mar-
vellous spew found by John Dunn’s camel
man. But that wasn’t a mine, and Bigjohn’s
visions of great wealth were soon blown out.

“Melb”: Dropped out this week, E. L.
Vail, lawyer. He claimed to be the first to
put up a tent at Canvas Town (Melb.) in
1852. I’m not so sure about it. Vail brought
a tent from England arid planted it near old
Prince’s Bridge (then very new). He was
warned of floods, and so moved to the heights
near present Government House. Others
followed there, replacing a familiar abori-
gines’ camp. The term Canvas Town was
generally applied to Emerald Hill. I think
all the people from the Domain cleared out
to that place. Houses could not be got, even
for those who went begging with money.

“Ato’ J : Joseph Hocking, principal of Mel-
bourne High School, is one of the quiet
conquerors. He opened this State
institution some 14 years ago and
immediately found himself up
against the “Public” Schools —Wes-
ley, Scotch, Grammar School and St.
Xavier’s—which boycotted the High
and refused to meet the pupils in
any branch of athletics. The only
place where High School youngsters
could pit themselves against the col-
lege boys was at public examina-
tions, and here they defeated them
repeatedly. The unassuming Hock-
ing has made the State High School
such a success that this year it was
found necessary to hold a competi-
tive examination to weed out appli-
cants, of whom scores could not get
in at all. The motto of the School
is “Honor the Work,” and the man
who hung it up has observed it to
the letter.
An o’d friend’s send-off:—
It was said of the late R. S. Smythe that he had
done more than any other man to make Melbourne
known throughout the world. As a showman, in
the days when Australia was little thought of as a
touring ground for platform celebrities, Smythe’s
enterprises radiated from Melbourne. It was the
landing-place of the personages whom he persuaded
to make the trip. Also it was the city where he
discovered a gold-mine in handsome Rev. Charles
Clark, who afterwards travelled the U.S.A., Canada
and S’Africa under the Smyth? direction. Proctor,
the astronomer, was the first of the learned and
unlikely sort of stars that the adventurous little
journalist brought to Melbourne, and Archibald
Forbes was the first war-correspondent. Afterwards
came fat George Augustus Sala with his yarn of
“Wars, Revolutions and Tumults,” which dealt with
the days when, as the lecturer put it, newspaper
men at the Front were not expected to take any
risks. Moncure D. Conway, H. M. Stanley, Yankee
Talma’ge and Annie Besant were other importations
of the pretty long ago. Two of his least notorious
lecturers were about the most interesting. Miss Von
Finkelstein and Rev. Haskett Smith talked mainly
on Biblical subjects and never drew the multitude
that runs after names, but the matter of their dis-
courses was better worth remembering than anything
that men like Stanley or Max O’Rell had to say. It
was as an importer of lecturers that the late R. S.
Smythe deserved well of Australia, and in the same
line his son, Carlyle, is making good. The old man
was a concert manager in the first place, after he
broke away from newspaper work, but in his connec-
tion with the musical world he was only one of a
crowd. He was as good as a horn Australian, seeing
that he came here more than 60 years ago to keep
himself from dying in his cold native land. The
pity is he never could be induced to write up his
reminiscences. So “R. S. Smythe’s Recollections”
is one of the bright books which did not come to
pass.
Recently Victor Grayson, the well-known
English Socialist and ex-M.P., after a com-
paratively short stay in Australia and
Maoriland, inarched in khaki through the
streets of Sydney as a private in the M.L.
troops. He looked well, felt well, and was
getting on well —which will be a good thing
for his Australian friends to hear ; because
misfortune of more than one kind had him
by the throat when he left England, and still
■ hung on to him when he was in Sydney.
The first trepang-gatherer in Australia
was one James Aickin, who reached Sydney
in the Supply in 1794. When the Porpoise
and the Cato ran on Wreck Reef on the
Queensland coast it was discovered that
trepang was plentiful there, and early in
1804 Aickin took a schooner up from Sydney
to collect what he called “Beechley-Mar.”
It was said to be worth at that time £5O a
ton in Canton. According to Aiekin's own
account, “after having been exposed to
extreme hazard and imminent danger,” ho
returned “unsuccessful and disappointed.”
Later in the year he took Simeon Lord’s
schooner Marcia to look for trepang and!
sandalwood, but that venture was not much
of a success either.

tralians, • and very rarely indeed from
foreigners.

E. W. Bearby, who passed out at Wick-
ham (N.S.W.) the other day, did his bit
for over 40 years at building up Australian
industries. Born in Lancashire in 1842,
Bearby served his time at the moulding
trade, and then went to sea. One of his
ships was the old-time East Indiaman
Sobraon, afterwards a reformatory ship in
Sydney Harbor, and now, under the new
name Tingira, the training vessel for the
Australian Navy. Bearby landed in Sydney
late in the ’oo’s, and worked in local foun-
dries for some years. In 1874 he started as
engineer and ironfbunder in partnership with
now-deceased Robert Morison at Bullock
Island —later the Newcastle suburb of Car-
rington. James Morison, also deceased,
joined the firm a little later. The early days
were strenuous. The partners had to punt
their materials to the island and cut trees
from the surrounding mangrove swamp to
get wood for their patterns. But the busi-
ness, how owned by a limited co., has been
a flourishing one for many years. In his
i>pare time Bearby helped to found the
Northern Districts Cricket Association, of
which he was, later, patron ; and he was also
one of the governing body of Newcastle Hos-
pital.

Archbishop Mnnnix will inevitably be pro-
posed for the Melbourne University Council
on the grounds that he was a member of the
Dublin University Council and president of
the great Maynooth College, and is virtual
founder of the Melbourne Catholic College.
Then there will be a row. There was dis-
agreeableness even over a proposal to put the
mild Archbishop Carr on the University
Council, and he withdrew disgusted. His
successor isn’t of the withdrawing sort.

vice A. G. Jenkins, deceased, had never given
politics two thoughts till lately, having been
much too busy making a fortune out of
rags. But he has started off right. He has
gone up to W.vndham with a private sec.,
and will probably go on to Darwin. Look-
ing at the matter with a business man’s eye,
he is bent on finding out what keeps that
country from holding more than about one
white person per 100 sq. miles. For this
sort of job Boan has large natural qualifica-
tions. Any man in the wholesale fluff trade
will tell you that he is a man of such
rapid decision that he is the quickest big
buyer in the Australian rag trade. And
one of the best.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” turns back a leaf:
Dan Wilkie, East Melbourne’s departed cricketer
(B. 17/5/T7), was the son of an old-time doctor,
David Elliot Wilkie, who was the returning-officer
for East Melbourne in ’6l when a vacancy occurred.
Edward Cohen and Pat O’Brien were candidates.
Just then a dissolution was granted, and the candi-
dates agreed that it would be a waste to contest an
election in a dying Parliament. They therefore
decided to nominate an absentee, C. H. Ebden, then
on his way out from England. They did so, but this
move did not please the pubs, and Michael D’Arcy,
a Swanston-street Bung, proposed Graham Berry,
who was standing in the crowd in front of the
hustings, which were erected in front of the old
police court. The nomination having been duly
seconded, a show of hands was called for, which Dr.
Wilkie pronounced to be in favor of Graham Berry.
A poll was not demanded, and on the show of hands
Berry was declared elected. That night Graham
Berry made his first appearance in Parliament.
Lieut.-Col. W. E. H. Cass has had
many experiences since he used to

and later the commanding- of the 2nd Bat-
talion from Lonesome Pine until the
Evacuation. Having been invested by
George R. at Buckingham Palace, he re-
turned to Australia after a spell in France
and England, and is now Director of Mili-
tary Training. On May 24 he was asked
to address his old Middle Park school, and
he told how, when wounded at Helles, he
was carried -to safety by Sergeant Camp-
bell, who was. one of his old pupils.

improving the occasion, and quoting the

The National, like the others, has lost some
of its profitable foreign exchange business;
but it is able to more or less even up things
by reason of the increasing dearness of
money. Its own funds are now £2,11)1.915,
and if it averages only -J p.c. more on that
lot than it used to it means £10,809 extra it
year. Australian banks don't, very fortu-
nately, make a practice of cutting one
another’s throat; and in those circumstances
it is a comparatively easy matter to so
arrange things that adverse conditions shall
not seriously affect profits. Yet, though they
have a very good understanding among them-
selves, Australian banks are really hot a
greedy lot'. Take the average funds (capital
and reserves) of this bank during tlie hist
few years at £2,000,000. The average pro-
fits thfen have been little more than 74 p.c.,
notwithstanding that the bank has bad the
use of over £6,000,000 of deposits at interest
and 44 millions of free deposits. If, all
round, it lias netted only 4 p.c. p.a. on the
deposits, etc., then it has made only about
4£ p.c. on its own funds; and you can’t call
that greedy. Certainly, in addition to the
profits disclosed, there may have been tenta-
tive profits undisclosed and passed to an in-
ternal reserve or contingency account. But
no Australian bank has yet burst through
the swelling of its internal reserve. So long
as we have public borrowing orgies so long
will we have booms; and so long as we have
booms so long, perhaps, will banks make
losses through lending too much on the basis
of inflated values. And Australian banks
have other troubles to provide against —
slumps due to drought or tlie collapse of a
market for some staple product. The conse-
quent losses keep a bank’s internal reserve
from becoming unwieldy; and for all prac-
tical purposes you can disregard the talk
about undisclosed banking profits and assume
that a bank makes no more than it says it
does. Sometimes it makes a good deal less.
So far, though war has been raging for
nearly three years, and though the Common-
wealth is spending about a million a week
on it, Australian bank figures, on tlie whole,
show no ill effects. Victorian deposits have
gone back only from £48,600,000 to
£47,700,000 in the past two years ; and there
wouldn’t have been even that shrinkage if
some of the payment for wheat and wool
hadn’t been deferred. So far as the National
is concerned the figures for 1915-16-17 com-
pare this way :

This shows that the National has done better
than the average; for its deposits have
actually increased —from £11,081,514 to
£11,795,345. Instead, however, of risking
any of this extra money in ordinary ad-
vances, the bank has strengthened its holding
of cash, and is thus keeping itself in a posi-
tion, not only to comfortably repay the
deposits which have been left with it for safe
custody till the war-clouds clear, but also to
give a bit of help in presently solving post-
war problems—and some of those problems
are going to call for a lot of help.
What the early future holds for-Australia
tl'is paper doesn’t know; so it doesn't know
what the future holds for Australian banks.
But there is this to remember. The hard
times that are probably ahead of us will be
due to the fact that we have got to pay back
a vast amount of borrowed money, much of
it foreign loans, and meantime scrape up in-
,terest on the unpaid balance. This means
that we shall have to struggle to stimulate
production ; and, though so far as the nation
is concerned, it will be only to work off a
dead horse, the banks may expect to do very
well both in financing the producers and out
of the exchange of the products.

'Exclusive of Replacement and Depreciation Fund.
In comparing present profits with those of
past terms note that in 11(15 this lump of
sweetness was broken into two. The Aus-
tralian business was left with tlie old co.,
whose capital (£3,250,000) remained un-
altered, and a separate co. was formed to
take over the Fiji and Maoriland business.
For .each share in the old co. the holder got a
0 p.c. pref. share in the new as a bonus.
The capital of the new co. is £3,500,000;
the other £250,000 is ordinary capital sub-
scribed by the parent co., which thus gets all
the divided profits of the new co. in excess of
the pref. shareholders’ 6 p.c. Thus a 64 p.c.
div. paid by this co. added to the Fiji Co.’s
(i p.c. is as good as a 124 p.c. prior to the
division of the assets.
As for the profits, let’s drop in here the
record of the Fiji and M.L;-Go., as far as it
has gone : —•
C.S.R. Co. (Fiji and N.Z.) Ltd.:—

Mar., Net Profits. Dividends. Reserves. Reserves.
1916. .£328,830 6 p.c.= £202,500 £126,330 £126,330
1917.. 340,201 6 „ „ 210,000 130,201 256,531
Note that the figures in each line are for a
full year. Add the profit disclosed by the
parent co., and it will be found that the
average combined net profit per half-year 6f
the two cos. has been £304,761, which is far
in excess of the profit disclosed by the old
co. in any single half-year. But from the
fact that the old co. was able to write up its
assets by over three millions it is clear that
very large profits were made and not dis-
closed. In addition to the average half-
yearly profit of £304.761 large reserves have
been made against depreciation. Already the
Fiji and M.L. Co. has established a fund of
£194,405. Whether any other provision has
been made against depreciation and contin-
gencies this paper doesn’t know. It certainly
hasn’t been the habit of the management to
throw all. its cards on the table.
For the past two years the Commonwealth
has taken over the Australian sugar output
and arranged with this co. to refine and
handle it; and the Queensland Government is
pushing into the milling business. But there
is no immediate prospect of any more dras-
tic action by the Commonwealth, and’ the
Queensland Government is showing no capa-
city to run any business economically. If
the co. doesn’t become too outrageously
greedy it will therefore probably be left
alone—for some years to come, at any rate.
Certainly there appear to be far smaller
chances of interference than there were a
few years ago. The greatest danger at pre-
sent is from the increase of costs in the cane-
fields and mills. This may result in the
Queensland cane-gi owing business either
shrinking or passing into the hands of
Italians and others \v'io are not Australians
or British; while in Fiji the refusal of the
Indian Government to allow coolies to he in-
dented on the old terms threatens trouble.
The C.SJt. has, however, such a capacity
for looking after itself that it may be trusted
to be the last to suffer.

The Australian residential hotel hasn’t yet
accommodated itself to new conditions:
labor and other expenses have gone up
enormously, and tariffs haven't gone up to
correspond. To make matters worse, the
profit from the bar, which is a sideline in
hotels of this class, has been whittled away
to a very fine point; and, so far as this pub
is concerned, the practical disappearance of
the tourist from the face of the earth has
been another blow. The most the directors
can think of for the comfort of hungry share-
holders is that things are nut quite as bad as
they were; and they "ask for the personal
interest of every shareholder in supporting
the residential trade of the hotel, so that we
may hold our own, and eventually, at the
end of the present period of depression,
secure that measure of prosperity which will
make our shares a profitable investment.” It
is something of a public misfortune that
shares in a first-class residential hotel should
be a poor investment. In Australia this is,
however, a common experience; almost every
first-class pub makes a loss for its original
owners. Most of the explanation lies in the
fact that Australia hasn’t yet learned to
either charge or pay enough for superior
pub accommodation. Melbourne certainly
isn’t over-supplied with such accommoda-
tion ; yet so unprofitable is it under present
conditions that during the past year part of
this pub was converted into self-contained
flats. The financial result is said to be
satisfactory.
The Grand is valued at £92,501. exclusive
of furniture, and there is a plaster of
£52,000 on it. This costs 5 p.c. The share
capital is £39,318 —£4 shares now paid up to

“Suildry debtors” are mostly hire agree-
ments. The co.’s contracts don’t, as a rule,
run more than three years; but it is evident
that almost enough new business is coming
in to replace the old. Whether that is
going to continue is very doubtful. Aus-
tralia will have a lot of- paying-up to do
presently, and in this process of liquidation
many people will be pinched. Just at pre-
sent we are maintaining a bogus prosperity.
When that passes the real economy will
have to start; and that isn’t the time when
luxuries will be bought. Which will not be
gcofl for Nicholson’s, who deal mainly in
luxuries. The co. has, however, this great
advantage: none of its capital is represented
by goodwill or other shadowy assets. And
its reserves are now so substantial that if
it can earn only 5 p.c. on its funds it can
pay a 6 p.c. dividend and still have a tidy
bit to put aside to provide for accidents.

Three years of war, during which the profits
have been £10,(554 compared with £748(5 in
the three years of prosperous peace before
the war! But this is so common an experi-
ence that it seems now hardly worth a
remark. At first people were a bit ashamed
of showing bigger profits than they had pre-
viously made. There was an old-fashioned
idea that it wasn’t a decent thing to make
money out of so great a national tragedy. We
have quite got over that now —which is noth-
ing to our credit. But, actually, all our
balance-sheets are wrong. They show the
IV and L. which are Idling up;
they don’t show the liabilities which are
also piling up —the liabilities for taxes to
repay the borrowed money on which so many
traders are having a good time. The future
of this or any similar co. cannot therefore
be safely gauged by the recent past. But
it can at least be said of this little co., which
is in the dental-supply business, that it seems
to know what to expect. It is therefore not
borrowing money to pile up stocks at war
prices. It owes altogether under £2500. and
its stock is valued at £14.785, as against
£19,108 on March 31, 1915. Book debts have
also been reduced a trifle. But in cash and
War Loan the co. now holds £11,983, com-
pared with £324 in 1915, and foreign houses
hold £5OOO of its money, as against £3500.
As the share capital has stood still at
£29,431. these figures suggest to anybody
with half an eye that the co. hasn’t gone
out of its way to magnify its profits.

New Britain Corporation, Ltd. —This is
a Sydney co. which was formed nine years
back to buy from the German Government
an option over 1250 acres of freehold at five
marks (= 4s. lid.) per acre. Though plant-
ing was started in 1910 the option was never
exercised, and the land “cannot be finally
acquired until the British Administration
permits it. and may not be during the cur-
rency of the war.” Thus far 070 acres have
been planted, all with cocoanuts; the first
little lot of copra was marketed last year,
but it will be a couple of years at least
before the estate can be'self-supporting. The
capital is £25,000. of which £16,000 has been
called up. On one issue a premium of £lOOO
was got. The co.’s debts at the end of last
year totalled £2457. Tlie development of
the estate lias thus far cost £17.915, and
there are cash and movable assets valued at
£1370. Apart from the market for copra
(which looks all right), the future depends
very largely upon the labor supply. At pre-
sent recruiting is “difficult and costly,” and
there is no visible reason to expect that it
will improve quickly.

The Co-operative Assurance Co. has
published the report of T. W. Bremner, who
has lately made the first actuarial examina-
tion into its affairs. In the Ordinary
Department there are 566 policies assuring
£126,395, and against them, on a 4 p.c. basis,
the co. should have £8573 in reserve. In
the Industrial Department there are 3508
policies assuring £93,257, and the co. should
have £6461 towards meeting the liability
under this lot. That is, £15,034 for the two
lots. Actually the co. has only accumulated
£1416 out of premiums and interest earn-
ings. In fact, strictly it has accumulated
nothing at all, but has spent £24.092 in
excess of premiums and interest. But that
isn’t alarming when the gradual change in
the figures is considered: —

1914 „ „ „ „ 4,584
1915 „ „ „ „ 1,436
1916 —Surplus Income ~ Outgoings. . 1,416
The position is thus steadily improving, and
in a few years, with ordinary luck, the co.
will no doubt have- accumulated as much
a.s it ought to hold. Meanwhile the policy-
holders are amply covered ; for while reserves
of £15;034 would suffice, according to the
actuary, the co. has, of subscribed share
capital, £16.121 in cash. £13,818 on mort-
gage and £2226 in sundries.

“Machine Man” : As The Bulletin said
the other day, the Broken Hill mines are
producing less than they should. But short-
age of men is not the only fly in the butter.
The new idea of having a minimum contract
rate (Justice Higgins was strong on this) is
partly responsible. The result has been
quite unexpected. Before there was any
such rate the men were paid by results. If
they weren’t doing over-well, they just bucked
in and tried to do better. Now, with “the
minimum,” as it is called, in force, if a con-
tract party is not satisfied with the price, or
if anything goes wrong, the chaps just take
things easy, and at the end of the fortnight
collect “the minimum.” Contract parties in
the South mine, which was quoted, range
from 12 to 26 men; and as a party of the
latter size, to make a job pay at current
rates, must produce about 1200 tons of ore
per fortnight, you can easily see how produc-
tion gets it in the neck when a couple of big
parties decide to “have the minimum.”
“X.Y.”: For some months past articles
have appeared in the Australian press
describing in glowing colors the wealth of
gold lying on the ocean beaches of N. 8.
Wales, only waiting to be shovelled up. Of
several hundreds of miles of such gold-bear-
ing beach I can speak with authority derived
from practical investigation, and I advise the
public strongly not to notice the sensational
articles. It is quite true that the ocean
beach from Port Stephens to the Tweed
Heads is gold-bearing. It is equally true
that the gold cannot be saved by any known
process which will pay for labor at even a

problem; they have installed G 4 of them, and say
“The Ilardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

Not only is the seashore gold-bearing, bo
also is the land lying west of it, right to tne
Dividing Range ; but there is not a payable
gold-mine or an alluvial diggings in that
large area. The difficulty is. not the scarcity
of gold, but its wide distribution, borne ot
the articles have spoken of the beach go.d as
‘•coarse.” All I can say is that I have never
seen coarse gold taken from the beach, and 1
do not believe that it exists, except in the
rarest cases. Most of it is as fine as wlieaten
flour; hence the difficulty of saving it. In
1893. and for about three years thereafter,
the beach spoken of was tested, with the
result that men working 10 and 12 hours a
day could obtain from four to ten dwts. per
week, if they had luck. I have seen 300 men
on the beach from Harrington to Crowdy
Head, five miles, and the same number from
the south entrance of the Manning to Black
Head, about 10 miles, and I feel sure that
they did not average 10s. worth of gold per
week. Platinum and its allied rare metals
were always associated with the gold.

Among minerals exported from N. S.
Wales in the first quarter copper, 6375 tons
(£772,316), takes front rank, because the
red metal from Queensland and Tasmania
is sent to Port Kembla to be refined. Queens-
land statistics show an output of 3637£ tons
during the quarter, and Tasmania about 1500
tons. Queensland will show still more this
current' term, for Cloncurry can improve on
its 1573 tons of copper in three months.
C.S.A., Cobar (N.S.W.), having suffered
from furnacfe delays, is building a second pot
with a daily capacity of 150 tons.
The only Hill End (N.S.W.) show re-
turning anything is Hawkins’ Reward,
which showed a profit of £l4OO for-its last
year after handling £BOOO worth of gold,
worth a little less than an ounce. No div. is
paid. The capital of the cos. now on the
field totals about £lOO,OOO, the Amalgamated
having £60,000, Hawkins £20,000, and the
Central the balance. The field is in the hands
of these three. The operations in the Amal-
gamated and the Central are co-operative,
and nothing striking is likely for some time.
In the old days liawsthorne’s (one acre) had
a capital of £120,060; Rapp’s (two acres),
£125,000. Beyers and Holtermann, who un-
earthed the famous, nugget, had only an
acre, with £72,000 to back it up. Now 133
acres are held by the three cos., the Amalga-
mated having 90 and the other two about 20
each. Nevertheless, there’s a lot of faith in
the old place; the Marshal brothers, who are
most prominent in the business, simply live
on that faith, and quote more or less expert
opinion in support. Most of the hopes are
founded on evidence which puts the field in
the same geological class as Bendigo. The
most promising indications are in the
Reward.
Mount Oxide shareholders are going to
risk another thousand or two. Justice
Harvey, the comparatively young Equity
man who has made such a wonderfully good
judge, found that Albert Gould and other
directors had been so negligent that the co.
had made serious losses and he ordered them
to pay £20,000 plus interest. The directors
appealed straight to the High Court; and the
High Court in effect cut down the £20,000
phis interest to £7200. Justice Harvey’s
mana is such that an appeal to the Privy
Council was immediately suggested ; and this
week the shareholders decided that, as they
would make about £14,000 if the appeal was
sustained and lose a thousand or two if it
wasn’t, they would chance, it.
* * * *
That Mt. Cuthbert (Q.)* wants every
penny of the £ll6 per ton it is to get for
its copper from John Bull is clear. Liabili-
ties when the smelter started were:—
Debentures .. .. .. £59,600
Deferred creditors . . . . 58,978 *
Sundry creditors and banks... 27,557
£146,135
Most of this debt is traceable to the cost of
the smelter, which is only running in a
small way because of the shortage of men.
The co. must be, earning profits, but not
what would be possible if the furnace was
outputting 75 tons instead of 50 tons a
week. Robert Powell sticks to his old esti-
mate of 158,000 tons of 8 p.c. stuff. This
gives roughly 13,000 tons copper. Costs at
£6O would eat up £780,000. but it is doubt-
ful eveft with fluxes so handy as at Cuthbert
if costs will not be higher than that. Every
£5 per ton puts £65,000 on to the total
costs. Assuming these mounted up to £7O
per ton and the co. got £ll6 while work-
ing out the reserves, there would be nearly
50s.'per share in sight. But it will take
three years to run the ore through the
smelter, and it calls for tons of optimism
to believe that £ll6 will rule for the red
metal all that time. The one thing for Cuth-
bert to do is to rush up the output, leaving
development work to wait while the plant
is ding-donging out copper to pay off debts.
State Governments a while ago said that
they were anxious to borrow money onl}
because they feared that there would be
dreadful unemployment if the construction
of public works was stopped. The bottom is
right out of that excuse. The Australian
labor problem at present is not a problem ol
unemployment, but of lack of labor. J-here
is not a Labor department in Australia that
would not, if called upon, report to that
effect. Most of the men sacked in. wholesale
numbers from the North Coast railway
works (N.S.W.) went to Queensland, and a
few thousands more could be absorbed. A
rough census was recently taken of mining-
labor requirements in the Eastern States,
and there wasn’t a held outside Tasmania
which admitted that it was fully manned. If
ever circumstances favored the suspension of
public works which will not give an imme-
diate return, they do just now.
Just before the war a local syndicate got
from Mt. Morgan the right to handle that
co.’s big tailings dump on a royalty. It
looked all right on assay; but the basis for
calculating the royalty was all wrong from
the syndicate’s point of view, and in the
end the big co. got 26 p.c. of the gross value
of the gold won. This and the war prices
of zinc and cyanide turned the hoped-for
profit into a loss of £lBOO on treating the
first 30,000 tons —and they were selected.
The enterprise was then abandoned. As
the syndicate got out nearly £15,000 worth
of gold, and as £30,000 or £40,000 more can
probably be got out of wholly discarded stuff
which the co. is covering over with ashes,
there is a local suggestion that the co. might
make very liberal terms to a tribute party.
The syndicate, which put £12,000 into plant,
is willing to allow it to be used for a small
percentage on cost.

J. L. Wharton is making an effort to form
a No Liability co. to buy the Fitzroy Co.’s
Laloki mine (Papua) from the' debenture-
holders. The idea at present is to merely
call up enough to take an option for two
years. Payment for the first year would be
the fulfilment of labor conditions on the
leases; for the second year, labor plus
£2OOO, this sum to be reckoned as part of
the purchase price of £40,000 if the option
is exercised. Australian shareholders in the
Great Fitzroy Co. are offered 31 shares for
every 100 in the old co. That would mean
100,000 shares, on which it is proposed to
get in Is. (£5000). This, it is thought,
would cover all outgoings. Laloki has large
possibilities; and this * scheme gives share-
holders a sporting chance of making a re-
covery on a small outlay. The mine in
October, 1914 —since when no work has been
done —had reserves estimated at 319.600
tons, assaying 4.6 p.c. copper and 2.sdwt.
gold.
* * * *
Gwalia Central (W.A.) is again trying to
raise funds in London. About a year, ago
it attempted to get in £7500 by the issue
of 30,000 7 p.c. cumulative participating
pref. ss. shares, but its effort was not very
successful. The co. is now endeavoring to sell
the balance.
* * * *
The Melbourne-financed Devon, at Lin-
den, on the East Mount Margaret field
(W.A.). has added to its plant and started
crushing. About a month’s supply of ore
is ready for treatment. According to what
was told shareholders at the last half-yearly
meeting, the lode in the property is worth
loz. over a width of Bft. But how much
of this stuff has been opened up, and what
the reserves are, The Bulletin is at present
unable to state.
Golden Ridge (W.A.) still manages to
dodge the undertaker. Its dying depositions
were taken some time ago, but its condition
has improved slightly since then. For the
half-year ended March 31 receipts totalled
£9294. and the profit was £2590. This sur-
plus, however, included £l7OO obtained from
a partial clean-up round the battery. Liquid
assets, practically all in fixed deposits and
cash, amounted to £15,317.
Undeterred by its failures at Bullfinch and
Kookynie, Golden Butterfly is making a
third attempt to earn a living in Westralia.
This time it has taken an option on an 18-
acre block at Tuckabianna, on the Murchi-
son field. One report speaks well of its
prospects, but another —which the co. very
properly has not suppressed—doubts whether
values will be maintained at depth. The
Tuckabianna field is a new one, and is
declared by interested parties to have “one
of the biggest lines of lode yet discovered in
the State.”
Black Range Pinnacles (W.A.), which
temporarily shut its mill down in February,
in order to concentrate its time and cash on
looking for water and more ore, has deepened
the main shaft to below 200 ft., where a
good supply of the former is reported to have
been struck; and in view of developments
in the winze below the No. 1 level, the dis-
covery of ore is regarded as a foregone con-
clusion. The rock on which the co. may
split is the sulphide. This, despite official
assurances to the contrary, is alleged to be
troublesome and likely to present treatment
difficulties.
The lie of the greenstone' isn’t shown in
surveyor Macartney’s plans of the Edna
Consolidated as published. The only spot
marked is between Nos. 1 and 2 shafts. Man-
ager Aldridge relates that one end of the big
bulge is in contact with that fatal forma-
tion, and that it exists almost up to the
main shaft at the 200 ft. level. Aldridge
reckons that developments are satisfactory.
It is easy to see why. The big bunch of
stone at ,200 ft. splits, and he says thins out
to the north-west, getting poorer in the pro-
cess. If this be so it should put the pot on
for the poor old Central to the north ; but
the fatal greenstone lies to the south-west,
and if it doesn’t carry the shoot towards
the Central then Giblin is a Dutchman.
Anyhow, Aldridge plumps for the existence
of large bodies of stone hereabouts. His
modesty over the middle reef after the tarra-
diddle heard on the market is as welcome
as the breath of spring. Instead of talking
30oz. dirt he discards the rich patches, esti-
mates sdwt. and lldwt. stone, and won’t even
guess at ore reserves. This may be tantalis-
ing to the Fatman, but it is the wisest
course when shoots are as ill-defined and
workings are as shallow as on the Consoli-
dated. With another 100 ft. of sinking and
the battery going steadily, the Consolidated
will be able to measure up its possibilities.
There are four stopes on stone in Edna
May Battlers, but with only 12 inches of a
reef calls have to be made to keep develop-
ment going. The shoot looks to be about
270 ft. long, with the chance of another make
beyond the old Great Battler shaft. Manager
Taylor’s hope of the stone bulging underfoot
is about the best that can be put forward
to-day on behalf of the Battler.
* * * *
Nuggetty Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), after
paying £40,000 in divs., now r sticks on the
call list, as values over No. S level have
fallen off sadly. This leaves the best stone
to come from No. 5 level. Prospecting shows
the best-looking spot in the mine to be the
drive on the Welcome shoot at No. 6. Every-
thing in the garden there would be bright
if only a few more colors of gold would
average up the reef.
Complex ore propositions have usually to
put up a hard fight, so it isn’t surprising
to find Clonbinane (Vic.) talking about the
difficulty of separating antimony sulphide
from iron pyrites and gold. Experts say
that a separating plant will cost £3OOO, and
as the ore reserves are only about 4000 tons,
the directors are advised to go on with
development work. The original capital,
35,000 shares of ss. each, is to be increased
to 35.000 of 10s. The workings are very
shallow: the shaft is down only 100 ft.
Plenty of time yet for an expensive plant.
X- * * *
Ronbipon’s report, though five months old,
hasn’t lost in flavor. Here is an extract: —
The importance of the South-Western and Western
ltonbipon areas has been discovered since the forma-
tion of the co. and undoubtedly represent a valuable
addition to the previously proved area on which the
co. was floated.
On the extreme south-western portion “shaft
sinking has proved values averaging 85oz.
tin oxide per cubic yard from top to bottom.
The depth is 42ft., and the general manager
estimates that there are between 60 and 80
acres of this ground.” Also: “Horton’s
options are being tested, and results so far
are very satisfactory.” The only set-back
llonbipon has had is that it can’t get a
dredge for love or money, save the Deebook
plant. This is timed to start on the 00-acre
block in July. The price paid to the Captain
Miles crowd for this plant is a half share
in a new co. formed to define interests. If
Trong gets pugged up, why couldn’t Palfrey-
man transfer its plant to the Ronbipon
south-west ground?—that is, if the metal
market can stand the strain of having so
much tin hurled at it as will be got out of
that block if Eric Moore’s figures aren’t an
Oriental myth.
The Umeari Co., formed in Sydney to
dredge a rivei in the Philippines for gold,
has had no luck. The dredge has cut its way
up the river, winning 17oz. in the process,
or about an ounce to the mile, whereas 18d.
to the yard was talked about. There is,
however, a doubt whether the gold is being
saved ; and a. Sydney dredging man has taken
on the job of overhauling things on a com-
mission basis —10 p.c. up to £BO,OOO of gold
won. So far, the co. has spent about £55,000
and all the fruit it has plucked has been
bitter.
At the. mining conference held recently at
Ivalgoorlie Edna Deep Duff proposed that
sharebrokers should not be allowed' to sit on
the Boards of mining cos. On the whole,
however, the brokers belonging to the Ex-
changes are reputable men. Their member-
ship alone is some guarantee of that. But
any old sort of person can be a share specu-
later. It seems, therefore, more desirable to
keep the share speculator off mining
Boards. On that point, however, Mr. Duff
made no proposal.
What the war has done for metal produc-
tion. In 1913 the world’s output qf copper
was 989,810 tons; the estimated yield for
191(5 was 1,374,000 tons. The U.S.A. output
of lead and spelter is larger than ever before;
and the capacity of American spelter plants
has doubled in three years. And yet the
soundest opinion seems to be that the world
is going to see high prices for metals for
some years after the war.

My Dear Aimni, —
This year the school-kiddies’ Empire Day
chatter was mostly from the mild local par-
son, the exhausted politician having as yet
only enough breath for home consumption.
The most vital part of these assemblages was
the unveiling of rolls of honor, llomebush
►State-school had a memorial brought to light
Laurence, a local mayoress. Out
Mascot way the Gardiner’s-road schoolboy
felt a win-the-war thrill along his spine
when his mayoress removed the drape that
had hidden a list of 150 former pupils
and eight dominies in the Big Fight.
A gorgeous Empire League lunch at the
lown Hall was the most characteristic item
of May 24. The news of well-fed citizens
-getting very red and patriotic over the toast-
list will not stir the blood in Billjim veins
on the Western Front. Or in the Desert
either, where the tucker is simpler and more
precarious.
More sensible was the generous feed given
to old veterans of army and navy in Sar-
gent’s Booms. The G.-G., the Lieut.-Gov.
Cullen and a short tail of officials sat at the
board. The Hugh Dixsons, largely respon-
sible for the upkeep of the veterans’ roof at
Bare Island, also beamed over the roast and
boiled.
Empire-night concert, to help the Soldiers’
Entertainment funds, was a bright, well-
organised affair with plenty qf martial
music. The bands—Headquarters and Ist
Depot Battalion-played in the early arri-
vals. Later, the G.-G., the Cullens and the
attendant swains got their feet on the
Axminster. In the same neighborhood were
Commandant Lee and his lady and Mrs.
Harry Finn and two Titian-lmired daugh-
ters. General Finn now wears the prevail-
ing khaki; the old lobster-red service coat
is folded away in moth-balls. Mrs. Verbrug-
gen (in mellow voice), Humphrey Bishop
(a thin slab of English baritone with a
resonant voice). Philip Wilson (who sings
of Phillis and other best girls), Gwen
Lewis (sparkling piano and monologue
damsel) and more bands made up a breezy
show. The Town Hall was full.
The much-requested Captain Glossop is
busy unpacking his relatives’ photographs—
he’s a bachelor, you know—at Tresco. Eliza-
beth Bay. The nicely-planned scheme to
fetch out his favorite niece from the Fng to
order the morning steak has been b'otted out
for the present by submarines. The Cap-
tain’s own particular boatswain was also
left behind, because his missus was not
allowed a passport, she not being a Pre-
mier’s lady. Meantime Commodore Hender-
son lingers longer in Sydney, on account of
loss of health.
June 1 will be Red Triangle Day. You won’t
be able to forget it if you come into the city.
Moore-street and Martin Place will surge
with savory smells, and coffee all ’ot will
steal like incense up the nostril. Mrs. Syd
Dixon and Mrs. Guthrie are to be in charge
of one cook-stand; and Mrs. Sherwood, Mrs.
Alfred Lee and Miss Egan are likely to be
found behind Red Cross stalls that toast or
broil while you wait. Every battalion is on
the same mission—to help the Y.AI.C.A. with
funds to tend our men with little comforts at
the Front.
The Lamb and Bowman families, which
count as old in this bright young land,
though they settled here long after early-
eomers like the first Antill of Jarvisfield,
were linked together at Parramatta the other
day when Helen Bowman, only daughter of
a local doctor, said she would to Leslie
Lamb. The ’groom’s father was that Walter
Lamb who started fruit-canning either before
the time was ripe or with over-green trade
methods. Result: Considerable loss of cap-
ital. The Champions, father and mother,
came from the country for the wedding.
Wilfred Blaxlnnd—the first Blaxland was
one of our earliest millers—was a grooms-
man. A big contingent of the Bowman
family—mostly they hail from Singleton
way—sat down to see the cake cut under the
big tent on the bride’s parental lawn.
Mrs. Officer, wife of the squatter-artist is
over to see the show her husband gives' to
the Red Cross. She was one of the charm-
ing daughters of Melbourne’s great surgeon
Fitzgerald. Officer, by the way, i 3 a Com-
stalk, born in the Riverina. The pictures
he is selling for the Red Cross are going off
like debutantes used to. The Women’s Col-
lege has acquired for 50 guineas “A Pool in
the Darling,” a typical scene of grey-green
flecked with yellow sunshine. Sheep drink-
ing take away the otherwise thirsty look of
this big canvas. A smaller picture goes to
Miss I.ouisa Macdonald of the same address.
Her sitting-room wall will hang -Egyptian
Fields.”
Staff-surgeon Brennand, R.A.N. —he who
wrote a while ago of the stokers of the Fleet
—is back in Sydney. He’s at his old job of
senior naval medical officer.
If the Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide
Conservatonums are worth their keep they
should be able to take over the whole
system of musical “passes” and dispossess
the English examiners who now rule
the aviary roost. Verbrugghen is in-
clined to believe that music in Aus-
tralia (outside Macquarie-street, of course) is
as a voice howling in the gumtrees. He
may, therefore, say that the time is not-ripe.
But Professor Laver (Melbourne), Dr.
Ennis (Adelaide), Peter Board (as a N. S.
Wales Education official) and some local
musicians, with Mr. Sampson (Queensland
Uni.), may over-rule the lately-imported
gentleman. If the whole Commonwealth
cult is incompetent to set exam, papers for
Miss Ringlets—why then, of course, the
Loudon Board must still sit on her harmony.
But the idea of London, of all cities, setting
a standard in the matter of music seems a
little too absurd.
Tom Moore’s ghost has had another birth-
day. A concert in the Town Hall celebrated
the event. Surplus proceeds go to charity.
Not to be beaten by the* Shamrock, the
Burns Club got the kist o’ whustles going
at a monthly shivoo, with Elsie Peerless as
the soprano.
Did you notice the death of young Lieut.
Beresford Cairnes a week or two ago?
Killed in France. The soldier’s father, a
one-time bank manager in leafy Parramatta,
wasn’t offended when his friends mentioned
his near kin, the Marquis of Waterford.
The French Music Society gives a concert
on May 31 in the Conservatorium. The
Society aims at handing out nothing but
French compositions, old and new, as a
counterblast to those Made in Germany.
Kate Rooney and little Billee are at this
moment bumping along to Daddy Ivirkham
in New. York. Perhaps whiling the time
away with a writing-pad : for the contralto
can turn out smart sketches, chiefly carica-
tures of “advanced” fashions.
At the annual (1917) meeting of the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital committee
the hon. treasurer announced a credit
balance. As this is a thing most hospital
workers only dream of as possible in a
Better World, it sounded like a printer’s
error. But it wasn’t. The balance is only
a very small bantam’s egg—but there it is.
And part of the reason is shown in the photo
of the smart business girl, Mona JJaley,
seen here. Though
she has been secre-
tary during the last
18 months, she mod-
estly disclaims that
the balance is any
evidence of organis-
ing ability in herself.
But that a credit
balance should be-
long to what hither-
to was the most im-
pecunious hospital in
Sydney is evidence of
something desirab'e.
Matriculating at 15,
Mona Daley at 16
came second in a
State exam, for ty-
pists, and in the re-
grading topped the
whole bunch. Under the Board she is
responsible for the whole administrative
and secretarial work of Crown-street
hospital. Already she has stitched a
golden thread in its grey woof. A
maternal grandfather, by the way, was that
Michael Herbert who was surveyor for the
old Zig-zag—in his day considered one of the
world's marvels in railway engineering. So
Mona has an hereditary instinct for uphill
work.
Concerning passports, Mrs. Holman and
her sister, Stella Ividgell, are said to have
successfully bearded the Colombo lion that
threatened to Jbloek their way. Meanwhile
women of all sorts and conditions are sternly
commanded to stop in their own countries.
Lately there was mention of Mrs. David and
her daughter marooned in Nova Scotia.
Sydney’s fine old professor meanwhile was
toasting his toes alone on furlough in London.
A week ago Verbrugghen made a few
scathing remarks about the professional
musical critics of Australia. Incidentally
he may chuckle to read the advts. of Lionel
Lawson’s "first-appearance” on May 31 at
the Choral Society’s show, "after an absence
of five years in Europe.” On April 27 the
brilliant young fiddler really did make his
first re-appearance here, at a show in St.
James’s Hall. Not one -musical critic on
the daily press—though the affair had wide
publicity—had sufficient interest in music
to step across the street and hear the boy’s
fine performance.
The charm of Nellie Stewart (here is her
face) sets Tivoli audiences aflame with
enthusiasm these winter nights. On Satur-
day she was the mag-
net of the second act
of “Sweet Nell,” with
Clarence Blakiston,
in curls and top-
boots, as the uncer-
tain Charles 11. The
play, with its strong
“curtains,” lends it-
self to this scheme
for providing snip-
pets of Old Drury
romance. Our Nellie’s
speaking voice, al-
ways as sweet as
honey, puts her away
ahead of the impor-
tations that bring a
sharp Cockney accent
and a wad of London
notices. And in the
art of make-up she is still unrivalled.
The Children's Welfare Conference—two
days only—was opened by Excellency Helen.
In a pithy speech she pointed to the gaunt
spectre that has done to death 32,000 Aus-
tralasian babies since the war began. This
\vas a startler to those who count only the
17,000 or so adults lost in the firing-line
during the same period. Dr. Mary Booth, in
the chair, had given all the orators a 20
minutes time-limit. It was far too generous
measure for the opening session. In rather
a tired voice at the dead-end of the meeting
(the stars were coming out) her Ex. asked:
“Would anyone like to discuss the subject?”
Of course someone would. Dr. Arthur was
on his feet in half a jiffy talking about the
joys of surf-bathing. His electorate runs
down to Manly, you know. Then Meredith
Atkinson —to the accompaniment of feet that
scuffled for the homeward tram—popped up
in another part of the hall. Once a speaker,
always a speaker!
The invaluable Knibbs divided with Miss
Simpson, head of the Montessori system in
the Teachers’ Training College, the honors
of the opening session. Both had something
vital to say. The experienced school marm,
an expert in the kindergarten work which is
now gradually becoming the State’s business,
made the audience sit up and think. “Why,”
said she, "do we lock the gates of our school
playgrounds at half-past three or so? In
the wistful little faces that peer through the
iron rails, the faces of children who have
only the crowded streets to play in, I read a
daily protest against this policy, which fails
to grasp the need for making our schools
social centres.”
Sister Parker, formerly of Sydney Hospi-
tal, is nursing in Mesopotamia. But she
found time to say “Yes” when Captain C. B.
Rubie, of Ceylon, put the usual question.
He is chasing the Turk in adjacent swamps.
A very active old lady, Mrs. Sophie
Mowle, passed away last week. She was one
of the nine or ten offspring of the late Parson
Simpson, who came to this State in the
days when it was a growing “cawlony.” Her
husband. S. M. Mowle, a one-time Usher of
the Black Ttod, died a while back.
Officially the Red Cross has no knowledge
of the Shout or its rival, the Anti. Unoffici-
allv. seeing what they see amongst returned
soldiers whose friends are too kind, a num-
ber of its members are leading the hue-and-
cry against that old warrior, Comeanavone.
Mrs. Danger Owen rallied the Antis at the
B.M.A. rooms the other afternoon to tell the
Nat'onal Council dames how to, beat the
pewter mug. Seventeen thousand petitions
ready for signature are tearing round the
country. Some of the Antis raided a big
Town Ilal] meeting the other night, and col-
lected a few hundred names. But it isn’t
always as easy as that. Into the Antis’ city
lair in Martin Place, the Shout occasionally
strolls. One hardened old Thirst rested his
elbows on the yard of foolscap and glared at
the lady in charge. She: “Are you going to
sign?” He: “No I’m d —d [and a few
other things] if I do ! Good afternoon !”
D. B. Fry, of the Sydney Museum staff,
whose death in France was reported last
week, was a brother of Dorothy, who does
such charming black-and-white kiddy draw-
ings. Years and years ago, not long after
The Bulletin was born, the father of D.
B. and Dorothy wrote columns and columns
of social gossip for it. That was in the
days before Woman’s Letters were invented.
The Strickland youngsters, merry and
unspoilt, are missed by busy members of
Government House staff, who had to get
through their jobs in the intervals between
staccato visits from the small fry. They
were the kind of overwhelmingly friendly
kiddies Ethel Turner likes to write about,
and the chalet in Macquarie-street is the
duller without their chatter.
Musical Amy. Perrins has married her
young man in Singapore. He’s Tom Philson,
formerly of Auckland, and now a planter in
the Malay States.
Nineteen little beds ali of a row. with
here and there a footpath to divide the beans
from the roses that are going to bloom in
the spring. Nineteen young gardeners, girls
and boys, with an hon. treasurer the size of
Hop o’* My Thumb and an hon. sec. a size
larger. This is the Children’s Club at Wai-
tara. The president is Mrs. Bert Stevens,
the only grown-up who has a voice in the
gardeners’ affairs. It’s a patch in her
garden the youngsters are digging and plant-
ing. All proceeds pass to the kiddies them-
selves. So the hon. treasurer is going to
polish up his ’rithmetic before the summer
sales. On Saturday morning the hon. sec.
got 19 spades into action, for the movie man
“took” the Club —an adventure not contem-
plated in their wildest dreams. While the
youngsters were waiting for the camera
they downed hoes to pick up watering-cans
and put out a fire. This was an unrehearsed
blaze in a house opposite. So last Satur-
day counts in Waitara as the kind of day
you might for years sit waiting for on a
fence and then not catch it.
The dashing. Gordon girl, who went to
Amurka to work on the films, and soon after
yarded the gilded chip of a millionaire, makes
merry over her short movie career. Appar-
ently her new relations bought up the reels
containing Dorothy’s elegant self. But one
reel escaped the family censor, and it is
coming to this continent —probably on the
same boat as the original, who wants to
show hubby to her kin.
In the earlier war days (it’s such a
veteran now) the Sydney typists and other
clerical women-Workers banded together to
help. Amongst other things, they wielded
the billy and humped the tin mug round the
thirsty French’s Forest workers. Since then
they’ve “growed” faster than Topsy. On
Saturday afternoon their combined weight
supported a fete to raise more funds. Busi-
ness as usual—-every stall in the Allora
rooms was out for cash from all comers. Miss
Soubeiran, of the French League, opened the
show.
As the Daylight Saving Act is to go.
the girl who wears the very latest boots—
just a little lower than her angelic knee—
will have to rise an hour earlier by sun
time. For the last word in fashionable foot-
gear is laced. The holes are tiny, and the
lace is almost interminable. Time has to
be no object 'to the girl inside them.
Arundel Orchard, one of Sydney’s best-
liked musicians, had to bow his thanks at a
bumper complimentary concert in the Con-
servatorium. Free from the petty jealousy
that too often mars the cult, the happy
victim expressed his delight to be alive and
anchored here. Usually a benefit of this
kind is a memorial service to the dead or a
case of pipes to speed the livihg to other
shores. Dick Teece, chairman of the com-
mittee, remarked that the affair was not
only a testimony to the musician, but a mark
of appreciation of a jolly good fellow.
Dr. .Tenner, formerly of Leichhardt, is
now locum tenervs for a London doctor who
is at the Front. “The war is causing a
revolution in street noises,” he writes. “No
longer does the newsboys’ strident shouts of
er grite vict’ry fill the air. No posters, ro
placards, no news-sheets. Thousands of well-
known patent medicines, soaps, etc., must
now live, or die, on their merits. So much
for the paper famine. Then there’s the less
joyous clang of the dinner-bell. No ’taties
for the next six weeks! Still, we substitute
rice, _ turnips, beans and cabbage, and
survive. A grocer’s assistant, however, who
carries sugar may have to protect his
treasure with a revolver ere long.” But then
the Sydney doctor tries to comfort himself
‘with the reflection that the economic posi-
tion of the Hun must be infinitely worse.
_ Pianist Budden Morris, formerly of this
city, is getting guarded pats on the back
from the usually-chilly London Times. Prin-
cess Henry took the best chair at the youth-
ful Cornstalk’s recital a few weeks back,
and he gathered a sheaf of praise.
Sydney’s Blind Institution is going to
have its annual evening-out in the Town
Hall on June 5. As a novelty the movies are
to show the trades the sightless sol-
dier is taught. The most amazing are pol-
ishing and repairing pianos.
Yours affectionately.

Music of the Allied Countries
“PIERETTE/’ by Chaminade ( France)
Delicacy and grace pervade the writings of
Mme. Chaminade like a subtle perfume. This
characteristic French charm is clearly, marked in
'‘Pierette”—a veritable gem of dainty melody.
Vividly it brings before one’s eyes the butterfly move-
ments of the dancer, the lightly-poised pirouettings and
sudden Sittings, the capricious and teasing actions by which
a Wayward Columbine provokes or repels her unfortunate
Harlequin.
There is a world of pleasure in exploring this and the
other compositions of Mme. Chaminade by means of the
‘Pianola* Piano; through its intensely susceptible control
devices you can give the music all the life and expression
that the composer intended it to possess.
The ‘Pianola’ Piano
—the modern pianoforte—allows you all the delights of
music, the pleasures of • listening, and the supreme joys of
actually playing.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, May 28, 1917.
My Dear Yakrie. —
Last week I mentioned the death in
France of Lieut. Frank McCutcheon. His
Engineering School pal, Lieut. Walter Alan
Leckie, has gone too. They were a brilliant
pair of Wesley boys, who entered the Uni.
together, and in their course few exhibitions
of scholarships escaped them. Concerning
Leckie the story is told at the “shop” that,
having in consecutive difficult exams, scored
the remarkable percentages of 99, 9S and 97,
he made inquiries as to where exactly he lost
marks!
Lawyer Fred Krerouse is now in France
with a Scottish infantry regiment. He
trained at Edinbro’. Mrs. Fred Krerouse
(once dancer Essie Perrin) is doing hospital
work.
Sub-editor Stephens, of the Age, has a
daughter who has won distinction as a mili-
tary nurse. She has now made four trips
back to Australia with hospital ships, and
says the cot. cases are more serious every
journey. The Vic. railways are doing their
share in helping severely wounded men on
their way to other States, and a new white
hospital car has just been finished in which
future cases will'travel from Melbourne to
A 1 bury.
Bonnie Watt Symons is delighted because
her husband, a captain of artillery, has
been put on an organising job in England,
lie went through severe fighting in France
before he was wounded and posted missing
for many weary months. The elephant in
the ointment is that Bonnie and the baby
cannot get passports to England.
Lieut. Eddie Creswell, son of the Austra-
lian admiral, is reported from France
"seriously wounded.” His twin brother
Randolph is with the Camel Corps and wears
the Serbian White Eagle on his tunic. The
eldest boy is looking for the enemy at sea.
Among the last batch of nurses to win
the Royal Red Cross is Matro. Ethel Maude
Strickland, who was appointed to a trans-
port as soon as war broke out. Ever since
she has been travelling between England and
Australia, and many a wounded soldier has
had reason to be thankful for her presence.
At life-saving drill,*once the boat in which she
and another nurse were seated was canted
by defective tackle, and the two Nightingales
found themselves looking into the soulful
eyes of a couple of sharks. The girls were
hauled back to safety just in time. Matron
Strickland was trained at Melb. Hospital,
where she was staff sister. Later she con-
ducted a private hospital at Sandringham.
Tall manager Cox, of Gordon and Gotch,
is proudly telling the news of son Cyril, who
went through the Pozieres fighting. The
young man relates how, at Pozieres, some of
the Australians were temporarily taken
prisoner. Then a rush by their mates
rescued them. The delighted captives of an
hour said “Strewth!” cheered, and, in the
words of the correspondent, “decided to box
on.”
Rupert Clarke, who toiled at Salonika
with mule trains and remounts, says he
takes off his hat to little Olive Ivelso King,
of Sydney, who has her car in Greece and
is doing splendid ambulance and other work
on the ordinary army rations. She looks
fit, and is very popular amongst all ranks.
The Wellington (M.L.) Military Board
was floored the other morning by a note
from an appellant asking exemption from
service, and cryptically referring it to
Deuteronomy, xxiv, 5. As one man the mem-
bers drew their Bibles from their coat
pockets, and with the trained eye ran the
reference to earth in a dead heat:—
When a man hath taken a new wife he shall not
go out to war ; neither shall he be charged with any
business; but he shall be free at home one year, and
shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.’
While the members were regarding each
other with solemn hesitation the Medical
Board put its head in the door to remark
that the appellant was unfit for any but
home sen ice.
George Fairbairn’s son Clive has got a
first lieutenancy in the Scots Guards.
Before leaving for the Front Clive wedded
Miss Jowatt, and wife and first-born are
now camping with mother at Mannington.
Mrs. Collins, the pretty young wife ✓of
President Collins, of King’s. College, Auck-
land, is. over from Maoriland on a visit
to her sister, the Weedon dame. Hubby is
going as far as Sydney to meet her on
her way home. The sisters were boxed at
a theatre party the other night at Her
Majesty’s.
The young widow Horsfall, who had been
buried in mourning since the death of her
elderly squatter husband, now performs at
the Glaciarium in fetching garments. The
lady has just run over to Sydney for a jaunt.
The Henry Cornish pair are off to Tahiti
for a health trip. Since the Cornish dame
was refused transport to war-work in Eng-
land she has fretted herself into an illness
—the sort you have to cure with an expen-
sive holiday. In Melbourne she works at
Braille for the blind.
Governor Stanley was honored with a
seat at the same table as W. M. Hughes at
a smoke concert given at the Savage Club
on Saturday in aid of the British Red Cross.
Boss Savage John Madden kept order among
the tribe, which, possibly owing to the
absence of firewater, did not at any stage
become unruly. Savages Bertie Zelman.
.Tack Amadio, Fred Collier, secretary Bill
Tainsli and others made glad noises with
their voices or other barbarous instruments,
and Fred Newman and Teddy Holroyd were
permitted to present a short play.
The Bardwells, of Woodlands station, near
Wagga (N.S.W.), have had shocking luck
lately. Recently the two girls were motor-
ing themselves along a country road when
the steering-gear broke and they were both
thrown out. Now the homestead has been
destroyed by fire. Valuable furniture and
other belongings were moved out: but the
surrounding hedges and trees also caught
and everything was burnt. The family blame
mice for the disaster.
Our old friend Lady “Tryphena” Doughty
lately had a tumble from her horse when
returning from an early morning ride. The
steed put his foot into a hole, and his rider
was picked up with a damaged leg and ankle.
Adelaide’s narrative:—
Artist Will Ashton and his wife and family are due
here in a few days, after a year in England. For
most of that time the painter employed himself as a
trolly-driver for the London Y.M.C.A. The Ashtons
will arrive just as the G. A. J. Webbs leave us for
Victoria. Their departure has caused lamentation in
the Cheer-Up Society, in which Mrs'. Webb has been
a keen worker since its very early days. At a special
meeting silver speeches and a gold watch testified to
her fellow-members’ affection. Mr. Webb must have
established something like a record for war-time by
selling 37 out of 38 canvases exhibited at the show
he held just before he left.
A banquet on St. George’s Day, a luncheon to army
and navy veterans by the Australian Government, and
a demonstration by the League of Empire fell to our
lot during the week. The Governor, who has sworn
off public dinners except of the strictly official variety
till the war is over, sent his apologies to the St.
George’s Society; but he was speaker-in-chief at the
veterans' lunch, and he had something to say about
patriotic duty at the Empire League meeting in the
evening.
We are promised something monumental in the way
of a post office. It is to soar seven storeys, and the
plans have been sent to Melbourne —probably for
cold storage.
Nurse Trixie Hall, who has done good work at the
Front and on a hospital ship during the last two and
a half .years, has capitulated to a soldier-’man named
Shaw. He is a captain in an English regiment.
Dr. Tobin, of Gawler, has received information
that his mother, sister and two brothers have been
burned to death in their flat in London. The tragic
news was sent by the doctor’s youngest brother, who
had just returned from France. Two other brothers
are on active service.
The Cheer-Up Society is to establish its soldiers’
hostel at the old Industrial School for the Blind in
Nprth Adelaide. For some time the committee has
felt that accommodation was needed for returned
soldiers who had no homes and were forced to live in
lodgings. Details of the scheme have yet to be
arranged, but the men tvill be charged a small
amount for food and quarters.
The German schools are to go, definitely, on June
30. Six of the have already been closed, and a
good many of the pupils from the others will be
absorbed by the public schools. The Education
Department expects to thus find itself with over 1500
new pupils. If they are suitable, a few of the Ger-
man school buildings may b'e taken over and com-
pensation arranged with the Lutheran Synod, but the
Act does not provide for compensation for schools
closed and not taken over. Apparently i very few of
the buildings are up to standard.
Dr. Charles Todd, who died suddenly at Mount
Buffalo on Wednesday, was the eldest son of the late
Charles Todd, at one time this State’s Postmaster-
General. Deceased’s wife, who was with him, is a
sister of Judge Backhouse, of N. S. Wales. One of
his sisters married the brilliant Professor Bragg, once
of S. Aus. University, and now Quain Professor of
Physics at the London University.
Over £l2OO was added to Trench Comforts
Funds by Friday’s Button Day, in' spite of a cold,
drizzling rain that kept the streets practically empty
in the early part of the raid.
The new Blind School premises were formally
opened by the Governor on Saturday. Lady Galway
was not well enough to attend. The opening coincided
with the 90th birthday of the evergreen Charles
Goode, who has been connected with the school for
years and is still its president.
Florrie Sutherland, a clever dancer with
the Royal Comics, and Bob Pearce, the Anzac
vocalist who was heard at the Tivoli a while
back and has lately been touring with Sig-
naller Tom Skeyhill, have announced their
matrimonial intentions. Young Bob is a
son of H. H. Pearce, of the Wagra Park
estate, Tallangatta.
Young Donald Mackinnon, soldier-son of
the recruiting chief, has booked himself for
the wedding march with an Irish belle named
Seymour.
Memories of Melbourne’s old friend and
Adelaide’s enemy, Thistle Anderson (Mrs.
Herbert Fisher), are revived by the news
of her second matrimonial shot in London,
the accomplice being George E. Shearman,
junior. Thistle used to be with the volu-
minous Nance O’Neill, and was of much the
same build. Her booklet, “Arcadian Adel-
aide,” set the Holy City gnashing its teeth,
for the satire was “most unwomanly,” my
dear. In Melbourne a smart froeker and
amateur Bohemienne, Thistle was wont to
cut a dash in her own hansom, fof which
she paid £l7O. The man on the box wore
smart livery, and there was nothing to touch
him until a chauffeur arrived with his own-
er’s car. Thistle.at once gave orders for the
swift sale of her chariot and the purchase
of a motor. She had a stylish flat at the
Union Club Hotel, where her first hubby,
Herbert Fisher, made a modest background.
Under the flags of Australia, Britain and
the U.S.A.. Ralph M. Odell, of Concord,
North Carolina, was wedded at the Ameri-
can Consulate one recent Saturday after-
noon to Vera Harris. Ralph M. is the bright
and brisk commercial agent for the U.S.A.,
and he met Her while travelling in India.
She is a typical English girl, whose mother
lives at Mussoorie, in the Hills, so frequently
mentioned in “Plain Tales.” The alliance
was fixed up amid gumleaves, carnations,
sweet peas, heath and berries, and the pair
fled by Sydney express towards Wilsonland.
At St. Patrick’s Cathedral last week Mel-
bourne Cappelli was baptised at the early age
of four days. His dad, tenor Tino Cappelli,
carried the boy, and Consul Eles of Italy
stood sponsor. Tenor Lois and his wife
(they have left the opera co.) were present;
also Walter Kirby. Mrs. Cappelli later
received the company in her bedroom, where
a very special bottle of wine was opened in
honor of the infant. Mother was robed (as
you might expect) in white, and her black
hair hung in two thick braids over her shoul-
ders.
Ada Reeve announced last week that the
response to her Anzac Buffet appeal had
reached £2OOO and was still growing. She
intends to carry the .campaign to Sydney
and on to Maoriland.
Mrs. Barry Thompson and Mrs. Robins
whipped up a Cafe Chantant at the Savoy
last Thursday for the British Red Cross.
There were tea, sweets and cigarettes, and
six charming girls in dainty caps and fichus
to sell them. Mayor Ilennessy took a table,
and gathered a jolly party around it, bought
up tons of sweets, gave one of the girls a
real sovereign to raffle, and generally played
a gallant part. Mrs. T. G. White gave one
party and Mrs. Russell Gabb, from Adelaide,
another. Tackie Fenner also did her bit
with a table of guests. Mrs. Barry Thomp-
son invited Mrs. Ross Sod.en and the
Dalrymples to her table. The Forrest dame
and niece Muriel, just arrived from West-
ralia, held quite a reception on their own.
Lorna Reid arranged the musical part of
the entertainment.
Ye Olde English Fayre, for the British
Red Cross, threatens to fill the Town Hall
on Friday, Saturday and Monday next. A
village green will be surrounded by Olde
English shops, and the village pump and
the stocks that wicked old grandfather used
to sit in.
The Mayoral Wynnes, of Kew, gave an
entertainment' in the Recreation Hall on
Wednesday, and it was worth £5O or so to
the British Red Cross. Mrs. W. M. Hughes
came along to help the Mayor raffle a bag
presented by Mrs. Wynne. Elsie Treweek
sang in a lovely white and silver gown, and
little Coral Trenerry fiddled.
On British Red Cross Button Thursday
(I won’t write all that again) the weather
was enough to depress the stoutest umbrella.
Iced rain fell in sheets and the daylight
petered out at four. Mrs. Woolcott (organ-
iser) managed a kiosk at the Block and
scoured the town—not with a scrubbing-
brush, but with her eagle eye. Presently
there was great excitement in Collins-street
about; a stand there. The organiser found
it still untenanted and undressed at 11 in
the morning, so she ordered its removal.
Then the stall-holder came on the scene, and
the brisk debate that ensued was one of the
features of the day.
The Austral Salon filled two big baskets
at its Gift Day—it is to have a stall at Ye
Olde English Fayre, and was getting ready.
Lady Stanley gave an address on the work
of the British Red Cross, and the Madden
dame sat in the chair. Genthelp Conant nested
in an easy one at their feet, and drooped his
long eyelashes effectively throughout the
speeches. Soft music was turned on during
tea; a ’cello was played soulfully, the
chairlady’s niece Doris managed the piano,
and Kirby sang. Alice Rees was there in
her widow’s weeds, and the Weedon dame
brought her Maoriland sister, Mrs. Collins,
of Auckland. ' Fliche, the tall French Con-
sul, looked in for a little while, and Mrs.
Robert Harper arrived late.
The Girls Who Stayed at Home—a band
of singers who made heaps of money for the
Red Cross here-—being invited to try their
luck in the Apple Island, are doing so and
finding it good. Local residents at Hobart
have taken them as guests, thereby ruling
out that vengeful figure, the theatrical land-
lady. Chaperone Mrs. Geddes and daughter
Noel are being entertained by the Fyshes;
Captain Evans and his wife have two girls,
and Mrs. Jack Miller is putting up another
pair.
St. Vincent’s Hospital is busy collecting
for the maintenance fund, and some splen-
did donations have been raked in. The
trustees of the late Robert Stroud have
given £525, Patrick Brennan, of Yarram.
Gippsland, £5OO, anti the State Treasury
£5OO. Lady Helen and the Stanley dame
are helping on the sale of the St. Vincent’s
book of miniatures, which is purchasable at
£5 ss. or more a copy.
The Italian colony in Melbourne is to
wave the red, white and green at a c-afe
ehantamt on Saturday afternoon to help its
own country’s Red Cross funds. The
Navaretti and L’Hardy dames have arranged
a programme, with the help of Vincent
Ricco. The Navaretti herself (Elsie Davies)
will sing and Walter will Kirble; and Zel-
man and Amadio will fiddle and flute. It is
to be at the Vi —er —Australia.
Max Meldrum, newly-elected judge of this
year’s V.A.S. show, topped Governor
Stanley’s opening speech with one of his
own. It was a long, earnest admonition to
his fellow-artists, and the little man read it
from manuscript. His text is ever Truth in
Airt, and he is courageously throwing out
inferior work. It is rough for the moment
on the yearning young damsels who paint
pansies, but very refreshing for some of the
better artists, who had come to think that
anything would do for the patient old V.A.S.
Some of them got the shock of their lives to
find the poor stuff shunted.
The Fritz Hart Conservatorium, which is
the faithful tenant of the Victorian Artists’
building on Eastern Ilill, is smashing its best
fiddle with rage because the rent jumped up
just after patroness Melba had decorated the
place at her own expense. “The bill came
to £112,” wails Fritz, “and now they raise
the rent!” “On account of the war,” add
the Artists gruffly.
Fred McCubbin, looking fit and well, is
back again and at work on the committee of
the V.A.S. He had been ill ever since the
beginning of the war. Dr. Sewell toned up
the artist’s nerves, and then went down with
typhoid himself. The doc. is just battling
through the long convalescence now.
Melbourne is not yet dead to all delights.
A series of “winter” war-lectures has been
begun at the National Gallery, Henry Gyles
Turner, banking expert, leading off’ with a
contribution on “The War and Literature.”
For June Henry Laurie will rake up all he
learned in his long experience as a Uni.-
professor and pile it into a lecture on “War
and Morals.” In July organist Alfred Floyd,
of Oxford and St. Paul’s, will set the war
to “Music.” Prof. Tucker, Melbourne
TJni.’s classical-philologist, will turn a trick
in August, with winter almost forgotten and
half the wattles blossoming, on “The War
and Education.” With the weather coming
on warm in September, Chemistry-Prof.
Onne Masson will drag “Science” into the
arena by the ears; and on a warm evening
of early October summer the “winter” series
will end v witli an address on “The War and
Medicine” by Dr. Stawell, who does know
something about the subject by actual asso-
ciation. It is a bright prospect, and all the
brighter because there is to be no charge for
admission —not even a collection.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Montalex” : The authorities cited by “Six
and Eight” (B. 10/5/T7) are interesting, but not
convincing; and discussion of the points they par-
ticularise would be quite superfluous in face of the
fact that careful injection-experiments with the
poisons of 11 different kinds of snakes—including
our tiger-snake and deaf-adder—have established
beyond question that, quantity for quantity, the
most potent venoms are those of, in this order:
(1) The comparatively rare hamadryad (Ophiophagus
‘laps) ; (2) the cobra; (3) the krait (also an Indian
snake); (4) the Australian tiger-snake; (5) the
African ring-neck; (6) the deaf-adder. This last,
by the way, is erroneously called “death-adder.”
All the viperines are deaf, and this snake, our only
representative of the class, is particularly hard of
hearing.
“Parkes”: Re Binghi’s immunity from
mosquitoes. I was travelling with cattle in the
swampy country between Moree and Mogil Mogil
and was assisted by a nig. from the Boomi district.
The mosquitoes were very bad, but Binghi was not
in the least concerned. When asked to explain his
exemption from the attentions of the insect Huns
Binghi said that if the belah leaf were chewed and
the juice swallowed early in the morning, mosquitoes
would not bite at night. The following morning I
chewed belah leaf for half an hour and swallowed
the juice. That night the corkscrew fiends were
so bad that they caused the cattle to rush, but I
was not bothered in the least. I have chewed the
leaf on numerous occasions since and have never
been troubled by the insects.
* # * »
“F.N.T.” : Here i* an improvement on the
deadly trap for mice recommended by “Mus-
ketoon” (B. 10/5/’l7). The kerosene-tin, half-filled
with water, is sunk so that its top is flush with the
ground, as “M.” recommends; but instead of covering
the surface of the water with a layer of chaff and
bran, to make it look like solid ground fit to hold any
mouse, the innocent country-cousin is attracted by an
even deadlier device. A round tin with the lid on,
say a tall coffee-tin, is pierced through the centre of
lid and bottom with a bit of fencing-wire, the ends
of which pierce the sides of the kero-tin at such a
height above the water that the top of the easily-
whirling roller is also level with the ground. Smeared
with grease and melted cheese the roller attracts mice
in myriads and rolls them off into the water before
they fairly get a taste. These kero-traps, however,
have their limitations. In many districts the
inhabitants carry out poisoned mice by the bucketful
(1200 to the bucket), and a trifle like a half-tin of
drownings is but a drop out of the rolling billows
of vermin. In seme places where the farmer is a
forehanded soul they use the mice for manure.
* * * #
“Wart”: “E.S.S.” accuses the gold-
finch of being an inn orted pest, but I
have never found them do the slightest harm—in
fact, they, seem the one exception amongst imported
birds. Sparrows are bad enough, but starlings are
the blue-ribbon pest. In this district (Launceston,
Tas.) they have exterminated the cicadas. According
to Fabre, the cicada spends five to seven years under-
ground before coming to thp surface and growing
wings, and it is just about this period since the
starlings became plentiful here. Last summer 1 did
not hear a single cicada. I believe the imported
birds, besides being pests themselves, have taught
some of our native birds bad habits. The black jay
and the summer-bird (cuckoo-shrike) of late years
vary their insectivorous diet with fruit, and the
yellow-throated honeveater has earned for itself the
name of “green-cherry picker” in some districts of
Northern Tas. The white-eye gets a good deal of
undeserved abuse as a fruit-destroyer; but I have
never seen the white-eve tackle anything more than
a mulberry or a very ripe grape, unless some other
stronger-billed bird had first pierced the skin of
the fruit. Even if the white-eye did all the damage
credited to it, the balance would still be on the
birds’ side, owing to the amount of aphis they rat,
and the white-eve is the only resident I know of that
tackles the evil-looking and smelling pear slug. By
the way, the white-eye and the whistling-dick, or
shrike-thrush, are the onlv birds I know of whose
vocal powers improve during the winter.
TRUTH WILL OUT!
PROSECUTING SERGEANT: “Now, boy, were you in the garden for the purpose of com-
mitting a felony
ACCUSED: “No. I on’y went to shake some quinces
COCKY: “’Ere, get up and ’are sonic grub!”
NEW HAND ( sleepily ): “No, thanks, mate, I never did go in for them late suppers."
“2G8”: “E.S.S.” (B. 5/4/’l7) has con-
fused Jack Howe’s shearing figures. Here is the
authentic record of his marvellous prowess with
the blades and his creditable first attempt with the
machines. He shore 321 sheep in eight (8) hours
neat at Alice Downs in the year 1892, and for this
received a 10-guinea gold medal from Cole-
mane and Sons, Coctamundra (N.S.W.), for the
colonial eight-hour record. The same year he bar-
bered 237 at Barealdine Downs in eight hours
with the machines—this being his first shed with the
machines. A five-guinea medal from the same firm
was his award. In 1.904 Howe was behind the
bar at the Barcoo Hotel, not, as “E.S.S.” states,
doing the 337 in 7hr. 20niin. at Alice Downs. In
five days Howe shore 1437 in his ordinary working
manner. That puts Livingstone’s 1153 for a week’s
sustained effort in the shade. Jack Howe is the
only man who ever could rightly be called a champion
—fee outclassed and beat all others time and again.
“Bromide”: “Montalex” (B. 12/4/ ! 17) is
right off the rgils when lie judge 3 the'potency of
snake venom by the rate at which it knocks a man
out. What counts in these cases is the rapidity
with which the poison enters the circulation and
its concentration. For example, a small dose of
toxin injected directly into a vein is fatal much
more quickly than a larger dose of a stronger
poison which is only .gradually absorbed into the
circulation. The sting of a wasp has caused death
in 15 minutes when introduced straight into the
circulation, yet this poison is sufficient to cause only
a local reaction as a rule. When an experienced
out-backer is bitten by a snake he does three things
—places a ligature round the limb on the proximal
side of the bite, scarifies the wound and rubs in
potassium permanganate crystals. The object of the
ligature is to prevent the toxin entering the general
circulation ; the second operation is to drain the
blood out of the adjacent veins and with it any toxin
that has been absorbed. The crystals act chemically
by oxidising the venom into a less toxic body.
“Te Whare” : Given a man, a gun and a
gohanna, the product is too often a dead go. But
seeirg that the go., though it may annex an odd
chicken or hen-egg now and then, is a boss rabbiter.
this is hardly wise. Gohanna tracks are constantly
found leading into rabbit-burrows, and from the
smoother trail of a snake these can be distinguished
by footprints at the sides. The diamond snake, too.
is a rabbiter, but where he takes one meal the gohanna
will take 20, and plumps for rabbit all the time,
hence the beast is sometimes (deservedly) protected
as a natural enemy of Brer Rabbit. The go. has
brains, too. A big gohanna with a hare gripped
about the middle in its jaws began to ascend a tree,
but couldn’t find its way to the top branches owing
to the hare’s body being fair in front of its eyes.
Accordingly the beast started tossing the hare up
in its jaws, catching it again as it fell, until the
go. got a hold on one hind leg only, when its vision
was no longer interfered with.
* # # *
“Pat Roll”: I can endorse “McNorth’s”
assertion that travel by boot along Papua’s
wearisome beaches is as pleasant as a tramp
through Sheol. In the south-east season there is
the added discomfort of drivirg sand and Ihe ever-
lasting buffeting of the trade wind to contend
against. In the Papuan Gulf the weather in this
season is simply terrible for small boats, and as no
harbors are to be found along the whole coastline
of. the Gulf—excepting anchorages in rivers after
risking life ar.d vessel negotiating the bars —the
white man has to hoof it from village to village.
Recruiters, magistrates, traders and miners all tramp
the sands, but the missionary is carried. It
is the patrolling magistrate, however, who
gets more than a fair share of the beach purgatory,
for it is his duty to tramp his division from end
to end, and keep the fear of law and order
ever before the savage mind. Added joy to
the misery is having to wait hours in’ the sun on
the mudbank of some swamp-surrounded river while
many cartridges are wasted in the effort to arouse
an odoriferous savage from his siesta, and get a
canoe brought along to ferry yourself over the
stream. The presence of crocodiles prevents swim-
ming.

THE CHAMPION MULLOCKY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
" e " ere driving down the Lachlan, on the Gunne-
guldfle road,
And the ground was soft enough to bog a duck,
old Jack Buckley steered the “shanghai”—it had
half the usual load—
And we hoped to flounder through if we had luck.
Kribendry Bob, the teamster, was beside me on the
box,
He was getting homeward from a little trip,
And at every gate we had him chopping mullock off
the blocks,
Which was .just as needful as the driver’s whip.
"C got boggeii right in the gateway just below the
Gulgo bridge,
\nd we dug for half an hour to start them out,
And when the horses struggled to the forming on the
ridge,
it was time, I thought, to volunteer a'" “shout.”
So we sunk a solid nobbier, and old Bob began to
talk,
And to tell ns of his exploits on the road,
How he’d'rushed his team through gilgais where a
magpie couldn’t walk
Despite the fact he had a record load.
“Acs,’ said Bob, “J’ve got the finest team was ever
lapped in hide,
And' if you’d care to listen to the tale
Of how they broke a record on the AVoolamundrv side,
Just light your pipe and sit here on the rail.
II was back in eighteen-ninety-five, when we had the
heavy rains,
I was coming down the river with the team,
There were miles of slush and water on the stock
routes and the plains,
And every little gutter was a stream.
“I had wool from Bogandillon, and I piled the load
so high
That the boss and pressers reckoned I was mad;
As it would have been a record pull if roads were
hard and dry,
Ton can guess what it was like when they were
bad.
Well, we got out to the crossing, and the current
made me. think,
But 1 pushed the leaders at it with a rush,
And the waggon reached the middle when the wheels
began to sink,
While the bullocks they were scrambling in the
slush.
Aes, she set there fairly solid, and the crowd
strolled from the shed.
They were hoping they would have a bit of fun ;
And Paddy Foley barracked me until I punched his
head,
_ And told old Band I’d kick him off the run.
Now I reckoned that the bullocks wanted ’bout, a
half-hour’s spell,
So I takes them off and drives them up the lane.
When the crowd thinks 1 am beaten and lets oul a
nasty yell,
But I tells them that I’ll tackle it again.
“So I chucks my string- of hides on, and the bullocks
know my plan,
They were ready when T swung my switch around,
Then I yells: ‘Gee, test the jew’lery, tear the quill
out if you can !’
And they stuck their toes a foot into the ground.
AVell, they strained against the yokes, and I was
chopping junks of skin,
. And using all the lang-age that I knew;
We stuck it twenty minutes and I thought of giving-
in,
When I saw the waggon starting to come through.
'T suppose it was a minute ’fore they moved a dozen
feet,
But I wound the greenhide lash about their flanks,
And at last I got them going—just to see them was
a treat,
And then I said—well, many a fervent thanks.
Tn a little while I stopped them; then I looked
behind and saw
Just what they’d done—it hit me like a shell—
For they’d dragged that loaded table-top a hundred
yards or more,
And they’d dragged the creek along as well.”

THIS FORMULA REALLY MAKES
HAIR GROW.
Some time ago I read in a paper a formula
for a preparation which was claimed to
destroy the dandruff germ and to strongly
stimulate the hair-growth. In spite of the
fact that I had already tried many prepara-
tions without benefit, and my hair was thin
and falling out very fast, I decided to give
the formula a trial. Accordingly I got my
chemist to put up 3 ounces of bay rum,
1 ounce of Lavona de Composee, and |-dram
of Menthol Crystals, and applied it regularly
every morning and night, rubbing carefully
into the scalp with the finger-tips. Much to
my delight the intolerable itching ceased with
the first application, the dandruff soon dis-
appeared, the falling out of the hair stopped
completely, and by the time I had used four
bottles I had a finer, longer and more luxuri-
ant growth of hair than I ever had before.
I have since recommended this formula to
many of my friends with equally satisfactory
results. I understand that this formula can
be prepared by all chemists and druggists,
and I strongly advise all who have not yet
given it a trial to do so immediately.—T.ll.P.

“Silas Snell”: The literary crusade against
mother-in-law has almost lapsed; not, I am afraid,
because ma-in-law is developing into a pleasant
companion for “the man Annie married,” but really
for the reason that the onslaught has worked itself
out, the complaining having threatened to become
as great a bore as the complaint. That Annie’s
ma is still a drawback to the married state I judge
NATIVE MODESTY.
BRODEGROOM: “No good, sir! She won’t
come in unless you tuck in your shirt.”
from the conduct of William Thompson, of the
Spit, Bullfoot (Vic.). Thompson’s mother-in-law, a
Mrs. Keegan, had been living with him for over two
years, without William’s permission, and in defiance
of daily protest. Mrs. Thompson invariably sided
with mamma, and threatened that if mother were
turned out she would go with her. I have the
evidence of the neighbors that Mr. Thompson lost
four stone during the first year of Mrs. Keegan’s
stay as some slight justification of his subsequent
conduct. One night mother-in-law went missing. A
week passed, and Annie’s raa had not been heard
from. Suspicions began to be whispered about;
neighbors looked askance at Thompson; Thompson’s
wife admitted to Arden’s wife that William’s con-
duct was strange, his comings and goings mysterious.
Mrs. Arden spread the intelligence, and a small, self-
appointed vigilance committee decided to watch the
suspect. The assiduity of the committee led to the
discovery of Thompson’s mother-in-law in a drive
at the bottom of a prospecting shaft up the alluvial
flat. It was assumed at once that the case was
one of attempted manslaughter; but ma-in-law sub-
sequently made• confession that she had fallen' into
the hole accidentally. Thompson’s offence lay only
in his having taken no action to recover his mother-
in-law when he found her next morning. On hearing
the suspect out the committee, however, decided that
he had shown great magnanimity. “Gorstruth!” he
said; “didn't I let down food to her?”

“H.V.E.” : The aboriginal tribes of West-
ralia generally have their work cut out to line the
larder. Here’s one bright scheme. The roosting tree
of a flock of galahs, or rose-breasted cockatoos, is
carefully marked, and under it the natives build bon-
fires capped with green leaves and sprinkled with
water. At nightfall when these are lit dense clouds
of smoke arise and stupefy the slumbering birds.
Many fall to the ground, while others blunder away
in heavy, erratic flight, and are brought down with
boomerangs. Another plan. In dry seasons, when
only a few small ..pools of water are left in the
watercourses, the blacks cover up all but two or
three hollows, and into these red-hot stones are
flung until-the water boils. Finches, doves and other
small birds descend in swarms to drink at these
pools, with the result that some take a beakful or
two of the hot water and die, while others are pushed
in and parboiled. Natives covered with boughs some-
times successfully stalk the wary bustard, or “wild
turkey,” while kangaroos are driven into bogs, into
which they sink at each bound, and are easily over-
taken. But, after all, the crab which drops a small
pebble into an open oyster and scoops him out
through the aperture left when the bivalve tries to
close the door is quite as cute a tucker-chaser as
these aboriginals.
“A.M.W.”: Wiukers on fiTe-brigade
rnokes were first abolished in Sydney some 20-odd
years age, when the “American quiek-liitching har-
ness” was introduced. The harness, consisting of
collar and traces, is supported from brass rods on
each side of the engine pole, with the collar stretched
open and the traces fixed to the sway bar on the
engine. IV hen a call of fire comes, the duty man
pulls a lever which rings the stable bells and opens
the stable doors. The horses have always their head
collars on and arc Jn loose boxes. The noise of
the bells and the opening of the doors are the signal
for the trained animals to run out and place them-
selvep each side of the engine pole and under the
harness. One pull of the collar brings the harness
down on them, the reins are snapped on to the bits
and they are ready for the fray—in about ssec.
from the moment of the alarm. The nags have to
use their eyes when being trained to dodge tinder
the harness, so winkers had .to be abandoned. Some
of the horses are very clever at galloping out of
their stables at full bat and pulling up dead in the
right position. For many years after Sydney and
most other brigades had adopted the Yankee method,
the conservative old London Fire Brigade clung to
the system of having the horses standing for hours
fully harnessed in the engines. When at length the
London Fire Brigade did fall into line, the petrol
motor-engine was beginning to rob the fire service of
its spectacular gallops to fires.

“Pick”: “Gumleaf” (B. 3/5/M7) says
that mosquitoes do not trouble the blacks. Well, in
many a moonlight duck-stalking expedition among
the upper swamps of Wallaga Inlet, South roast
(N.S.W.), with aboriginal Alt' Carter—one of the
few remaining bloods of the Wallaga mission-station
—we frequently had to drop good chances for game
owing to attacks from myriads of the hummers. Ami
Alfred was always first bugle in sounding the
retreat.
* * * »
“E. Tommy”: There’s nothing unusual in
“Daybreak’s” 11-months-cld calf (B. 26/4/’l7) yield-
ing milk without first qualifying for the bovine
maternity bonus or having even been guilty of giving
Jerry the glad-eye. While maternity is the prime
cause of secretion, it is not the only cause of stimu-
lating the activity of the udder. The regular removal
of saline fluid in the gland of the virgin is sometimes
sufficient to cause the secretion of milk of normal
character in considerable quantities. The phenomenal
udder development and subsequent large flow is caused
by the sucking of another calf, as is commonly seen
when calves are poddied and have finished the milk
allotted for a meal.
EASILY EXPLAINED.
“What caused the separation?”
“Oh, he thought as much of himself as she did of herself, and as little of her as she did
of him.”
“Ses”: Gohanna oil is now drifting into
commercial notice as a cure for rheumatism. It is an
old bush remedy, over the efficacy of which there have
been endless arguments. Bushmen nearly everywhere
shoot the gohanna, or lace lizard, for its oil; but the
oil is mainly used for machinery, for guns, locks and
any delicate mechanism requiring a clear, non-sticky
lubricant. It is obtained from two large layers of
fat, which are at their best at the end of summer.
At the beginning of winter Ivojurrie buries himself
deep in the ground, where he remains until the spring,
the folds of fat he retires with keeping his strength
up during the period of hibernation. Mrs. Kojurrie
is a prolific egg-layer. She digs a small hole with
her claws in a sunny spot, and the eggs are covered
up and incubated by- the warmth of the ground.
“Hay”: An Abo. writer gave December as
the breeding time of the black swan. This may be
the principal season in some parts of Australia, but
whenever the big lakes west of the Darling are filled
by the river, the raft-like nests of the black swan
Wet.
THERE AND BACK.
Dry.
carrying eggs or cygnets are to be seen floating about
in almost any month of the year. There, also, the
nesting time of the wild duck is when the big floods
come, and while the water covers the Hat country
duck-eggs can be found at any time in hollow logs
or holes in the box-tree butts by dodging about in a
flat-bottomed boat or a blackfellow’s canoe. I have
never noticed any fishy flavor in either the eggs or
flesh of these fresh-water birds. Binghi of the Dar-
ling River lived in a land of plenty, and it was an
easy job for him to gather duck-eggs in large quan-
titles in the shallow water. He appropriated the
swan’s eggs, too, though their nests were usually
made well out in the middle of the big lakes.
“A. Zaek” : Re statement made by “E.S.S.
(B. 19/4/’ 17) to the effect that the worst bird pests
in this country are aliens, I would like to ask what
about the rozella, the “leather-head” and the white
cockatoo ? Ask any cocky in the Riverina what he
thinks of these birds, and he will give you swearing
vocabulary all in the one breath. I have seen acres
and acres of wheat almost entirely stripped of the
grain by the pests, and I think that they are even
worse in the orchards. They’ll skin cherry trees
of their fruit in record time, and the larger fruit
will be so pecked about that it is pitiful to look
upon. This is where the leather-head particularly
shines. I don’t know if leather-head is his common
name, but he is a grey bird about ■ the size of a
pigeon.
“Petifi” : Grafton (N.S.W.) handled some
sizable local ironbark lately. One vegetable cut up
44ft. long, and squared to 22in. Three trees panned
out at £92. The timber is intended for warship
construction in America.
“Boro-Belle”: The Bananaland sugar in-
dustry probably holds the belt in regard to the large
number and variety of bells to announce starting
time, meal hours, smoke-ohs, etc. The habit started
in the early plantation days, when the newly-imported
nigger, Jap or Malay did not earn enough in six-
months to be able to afford a timepiece. Some of the
farms possess old ships' bells that belonged to the
early blackbirdcrs; others have a variety of make-
shifts, some of which are more far-reaching than the
real bell-metal article. On one farm a disc of an old
plough can be heard two miles away, while on another
a copper dome of a sugar vacuum-pan emits a chime
that carries three miles. Crowbars, iron axle-bars
and small anvils, suspended by a wire from a tree,
are the most used substitutes; but farms in the
vicinity of the sugar factories rely on the mill
whistle.
“Kukukuku” : The gaura pigeon is never
killed or eaten in -Papua. It could not
be, because the Government forbids, and no
one ever disobeys the Government in Papua. In
the good old bad days, when we could do as we
liked, we used to send a boy out to pot a gaura or
two (they are fatally tame) whenever we wanted
something specially nice. Old residents speak of the
dish with tears in their eyes. A gaura is
a pigeon somewhat larger than a hen ; it is almost
all breast, and as tender as butter. You roast or
bake it if you are dining by yourself, and stew it if
the local Resident Magistrate (censored). What
I mean, of course, is that one used to roast or bake
it, and that it was very good. One used to save its
beautiful spangled crest in those days, and send it to
girls down south for their Sunday hats. Now one
burns (censored). Anyhow, the gaura is—was—
very good.

1 had a sailor friend, his name
Was Simple William Henderson,
But never more I’ll see the same,
Because his mortal course is run.
Upon tne isle of Knucklebone,
Which is in far Pacific seas,
Bill’s ship was wrecked, and Bill alone
Was cast ashore. They found him prone. •
With pride the captive tar was shown
To Marf upon his bended knees.
This Marf was queen of all the isle.
She cast an eye on Henderson.
She liked his build, she loved his style,
She tickled Bill in giddy fun.
Bill sent a letter through to me,
Which said: “I've settled down, old sort,
And left for good the boundin’ sea,
A dusk queen’s consort for to be.
Come over if you’d like,” said he,
“An easy job about the court.”
A gorgeous time old Bill was shown.
They fed him like a fighting cock.
I left at once for Knucklebone —-
On April 1, at two o’clock,
I struck the court of Marf. A gay
And festive meal was spread. The course
It was the roast. Said I: “Good day!

“No,” said a chieftain tall and grey,
“These are proceedings for divorce!”

*‘B.”: The late J. C. Williamson director.
Harold Ashton, began his theatrical life
a raw novice with Wybert' Reeve in Adelaide
over 30 years ago. Two of his tutors in
dramatic decorum in that co. were Maggie
Knight and Oily Deering. J. Norgrove, The
Bulletin’s old-established advertising rep.
in Melbourne, shared a dressing-room with
Harold in those early days.
“Peg Leg’’: Seven pictures are in course
of product.on around Sydney this week. The
men doing them are Charlie Woods, Bean
Smith, Raymond Longford, Fred Bluett,
Jack Gavin, Franklyn Barrett and Gilbert.
Some of the players are appearing in two or
three of the films simultaneously, besides
do ng a nocturnal strut in' legit or vaude-
ville.
“Galleryite” : Tenor Charles Kenningham,
of the first “FlorOdora” boom, sang at a
recent Maryborough (Q.) smoke concert.
Songs, “Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes”
and “My Dainty Little Maiden.” Charles
looks and wears well, and his voice is almost
as good as new.
“Monsieur Beaucaire” is to be adapted
to light-opera requirements, the music by
Messager, composer of “Veronique.” By
the way, when is Australia going to get
some more operas of the “Veronique” class?
“0.M.”: Re “Fax’s” par. (B. 26/4/T7)
and the production of "The Mighty
Dollar” in England by the Florences. It
is interesting to recall that this particular
comedy was, when played up and down the
States, known as “The Almighty Dollar.”
But that title was not allowed to be used by
the British censor of plays.
“Monkbarns”: So Rignold left a diary (B.
19/4/T7). It is the delusion of most men
who have heard the public applause that
their autobiography would be wolfed. But
the most interesting, such as Coppin and
Irving, don’t oblige. Unhappily. What
would we not give for Coppin’s? As for
others, Barlow, the Blue Tail Fly, went to
Arcadian Cole with his Reminiscences, and
was astonished to lind them not worth
print. John Dunn placed copious materials
in the hands of his son-in-law, Marcus
Clarke, and rejoiced that he had captured
such genius. Clarke frankly said the stuff
was not worth his gilding. The best of the
theatrical autobiographies is that of the
Bancrofts. Next I place Ellen Terry’s.
Conductor Ilomualdo Sapio, wdio com
manded the orchestra that accompanied his
brilliant singing-wife and Camilla Urso’s
violin 20-odd years ago, now has a .vocal
studio in New York, which ranks as an
artistic Mecca, some of the operatic pilgrims
being of the rank of Nordica and Tamagno.
Soprano Sapio was a star of that Italian
opera season of 16 years ago which earned
more applause than money.
“Private Boxer” : In an Ellen Terry film
recently released in England the most note-
worthy thing is the first appearance on the
screen of George Bernard Shaw, who lends
a hand as one of a crowd of cheering vil-
lagers. Man and super-man, in fact.
“Stargazer”: These accusations against
Shaw of being a superlative self-advertiser
grow wearisome. In what sense is Shaw Worse
than Wells, say. or any other author who is
worth a tinker’s dam? “C. Ockney” in a
recent Bulletin is quite splenetic because
poor Bernard has elected to produce certain
playlets anonymously, precisely as if there
were some heinous offence in the action.
“This cheap flim-flam won’t help Pshaw to
get back that favor he has lost in Britain,”
“C. Ockney” assures us with the pleasing
assurance of having convicted George
Bernard of some shameful act. Why sliou’dn’t
Shaw give out his little plays as the product
of the non-existent brain of an imaginary
Brown if he wants to? Where is the gross
reflection upon him if the sapient Cockney
finds him out? When Wells knocks a mess
of fragments into volume form, calls it
“Boon,” and fathers it on Bliss, nobody is
really angry with the literary cuckoo, nobody
brings against him a charge of loathly self-
advertising, or accuses him of detestable
erotism or thrusting himself unduly into the
limelight by keeping sedulously in the dark.
“Masetto”: “0.K.” (B. 10/5/T7) is right
in saying it is 25 years since Marion Hood
was in Melbourne; but his memory skids
when he asserts that she was not here with
Leslie and Farren. She was. “Monte
Christo, Jun.’’ was the opening comedy
played by them in June, ’BB. The Marquis
of Queensbury arrived in Australia about
the same time, and the best-informed gossips
were quite certain that he hadn’t come to
see our wonderful country.
Actress Lorna Forbes, whose dad, Wilson
Forbes, died a week or two ago, has
now lost her grandmother, whom old-time
playgoers will remember as Carrie George.
Under this name she played with G. V.
Brooke (by the way, is there a pro. of the
old brigade who did not play with Brooke?),
Barry Sullivan and \Yi!liam Creswick.
Later, after having definitely “retired.” she
was seen in Sliakspearian work with W. E.
Sheridan and Louise Davenport. After a
second marriage she spent about 25 years on
a farm in Bananaland, but of late had lived
in Melbourne- with her dughter, Ada Law-
rence, who also follows the greasepaint pro-
fession.
Laver is still trying to feed musical Mel-
bourne with high-class fare, and has been
garnishing some of the dishes with a few
neat frills of speech. The idea is to have
advanced students of the University Conser-
vatorium render Beethoven’s sonatas for the
fiddle and pianoforte, while the Prof, gives
explanatory notes in between the items. It
may be an attractive programme to those who
really like that sort of diet: but it seems
likely that Melbourne will generally continue
to refrain from the feast until such time as
the caterers decide to throw in a few smooth-
backed. spring-bottomed chairs for the use of
the banqueteers. The hungry seeker after a
square musical meal still has to adjust its
terminals to a comfortless and distracting
combination of cane and bentwood.
Business, Robbery, etc
“Ken” : Here’s a sample of a bad Austra-
lian. I pushed aside ha,lf a d;.zeu brands
of imported sliaviug-soap, and insisted upon
being sold Australian lather for a plain Aus-
tralian face. The girl behind the counter
shrugged her shoulders, and gazed at my
blue-black chin, more in sorrow than in admi-
ration. “The Australian make is not nearly
as good as the imported brands,” she said.
The next time I entered that shop, my bad
Australian was at the farthest end of the
counter, daubing her eyes with two square
inches of handkerchief. “What’s the
trouble?” I inquired of another girl. “She’s
just got a letter from London saying her boy
has married an English girl.” I didn’t offer
any sympathy.
“Half-moon”: After a two years’ spell
owing to the closure of the Continental mar-
kets by the war, a limited number of diving
luggers were sent out to the banks at the
commencement of this year by the Thursday
Island pearlers. This was more in the
nature of a trial season and to test the
American markets. That the grounds have
benefited b.v the rest is proved by the fact
that the take of .shell in a given drift was
at least twice that in pre-war days. The
Torres Strait Shell Convention was formed
some time ago to watch the interests of
pearlers, and particularly the operations of
buying combinations. Shrewd Yank middle-
men have the Convention thinking its hard-
est. When gentlemen who own such names
as Weiseburger, Isenstein, etc., have to be
dealt with, it’s not an easy matter to keep
the windward position. The first shipment
of 1917 season shell is on i.ts way to New
York, and the o’d holdings of shell —about
55 tons —have also been sent to the same
destination. Prices are satisfactory, and
Thirsty Isle is wearing a more optimistic
countenance. Besides, trochus shell is sell-
ing at about £3O per ton.
“F.N.T.”: A year or two ago the Victorian
Government was on the point of closing
down its beet-sugar factory at Maffra, owing
to a lack of raw material. This intention
was frustrated by a deafening howl of pro-
test from influential quarters. That the
howlers were in some degree justified was
shown b.v the size of this season’s beet-crop,
which is twice as big as last year’s and a
record for the district The planting of the
factory at Maffra, by the way, was a sin-
gular blunder. Maffra is in the heart of
Gippslaud, a district which from Western-
port to Cape Howe enjoys a thumping rain-
fall of over 25 inches. More than half of
Gippslaud, too, gets over a dozen inches of
moisture in the summer-time. But the fac-
tory liapnens to have been sited in the one
small section which gets less than 25-annual
and 12-summer. Wherefore, right in the
midst of plenty of wetness, Maffra largely
grows its sugar-beet by irrigation. Next
time the Government thinks of shutting
down its factory it might consider the ques-
tion of shifting it instead.
The Commissioner of Patents has at last
granted a patent to the inventor of a solu-
tion of the grass-tree gum, or resin, for dye-
ing purposes. Patentee Somerville claimed
that his alkaline solution, as a dye for wool-
len, cotton or silk fabrics, was a new dis-
covery, and the High Court held that an
alkaline dye is radically different from the
mere stain which had previously been derived
from the same natural product. All that
remains for Somerville is to study the pre-
paration of his dye.
“Musketcon”: Bill Gardner, of Gundagai
(N.S.W.), does not agree with people who
say rabbits, are a curse. In one night last
week, assisted by a youthful son, he trapped
bunnies valued at £6 Bs. 7d. For the past
fortnight he has.averaged £4O a week!

“Peg-Leg”: Has anyone called round at
your shop yet with a request that you insure
yourself against litigation. I met the scheme
for the second time the other day. The first
occasion was three years ago. Here’s the
idea. Small shopkeepers, who have to sue
for payment, or who may be sued, were in-
sured for a shilling a • week. For that
amount the one-man firm undertook to brief
counsel for you and pay all your legal ex-
penses. Three hundred participants were
necessary before the insurance became opera-
tive, but there were special concessions for
coming, in early. The gross amount at dis-
posal of the aeent was £l5 per week. I was
among the first to put my John Hancock on
one of the gorgeously got-up policies, and
dumped my money in every week. Then I
discovered that, after paying for about three
months, only 250 of the necessary 300 weekly
subscribers had been enrolled, and the pro-
moter wasn’t making any efforts to get the
extra 50. He was quite satisfied to draw
£l2 10s. a week from us in peace and quiet-
ness. When last seen he was bowing grace-
fully from the deck of an outward-bound
American steamer to some “thwarted sleuths
on the fast receding wharf.”

The official summary of the reeCm; wheat
harvest in S.A. shows records broken in
every direction. The forecast was a little
Under that of the previous season
(34,000,000), but conditions have improved
so much that 44,000,000 bushels are reckoned
on. (How much the mice have nibbled isn’t
Stated.) The average is 15.55.t0 the acre,
2% better than the former best. Also barley
ard oats, nearly 2,000,000 bushels of each ;
and about 600,000 tons of hay—a slight fall-
ing off, prices not being tempting lately. The
increase in tlie wheat crop over estimate is
mostly due to the newly-settled districts
north of Port Augusta, and west along the
coast, outside old Goyder’s “line of rainfall.”
These seem to have got the hang of things at
last, and they have had a yield that nearly
equalled the average for the whole State. So
there is plenty of room on the land yet.
* # * *
“ J.F.11.”: Here in London there is at
this moment a unique collection of Queens-
land stamps on view, the property of old
Bananalander J. H. Chapman. The early
Queensland stamps hold the Australian
record for beauty and artistic finish. They
were designed by an English painter of the
period, E. H. Corbould, who must have
been angling for a dukedom, judging by the
ethereal portrait he produced from the
homely features of Queen Victoria. The
principal design displays the plain little
woman in a dress with Oriental
earrings and necklace of precious stones.
The collection of Australian stamps seems
to be a profitable mode of spending spare
time. A batch of early Van Diemen’s Land
recently changed hands in London at £BOO.
Incidentally, people should have a special
eye to -what the London dealers call the “gold
diggings” stamp of N. S. Wales, which dis-
plays a remarkable miniature view of old-
time Sydney. It is a particular favorite in
the stamp market and invariably commands
a high price.
* # *• *
“8.1. D.”: The other day I went into a
leading fluff empor’um in Collins-street, Mel-
bourne, and bought a card with 15 dome-
fasteners on it. It still bore the “Made in
Germany” brand, but while I used to pay
Dd. for them three years ago the price now
is 4|d. Is the 300 per cent, rise to pay the
cost of storing them ,since the war began, or
what?
“Te Babarantiko”: The quality of sugar-
cane in Fiji varies according to soil and
situation. On the lowlands of Viti Levu, fat
and black with the rotting vegetation of
aeons, the yield of cane is extremely heavy.
The undulating lands, where the soil is
poorer, yields less cane, but the “density”
(sugar contents) is greater. Of good cane
about six tons make one ton of sugar, while
of cane from the marshes up to seven tons
are required to make the same quantity.
Thus, paradoxical as it may seem, a very
heavy yield of cane is not always the most
profitable. There are variations even from
that rule. Last season the highest upland
estate in the N.W. country gave lesser den-
sity than anticipated. Yet the rule ho’ds
gcod. and on this basis the areas are
apportioned. On the rich flats the plan-
tations comprise about 400 acres, while on
higher and drier lands the area runs to from
600 to 650 acres. On this basis each plan-
tation is expected to yie’d from six to seven
thousand tons of cane. Badila, a New Guinea
variety, is the cane almost exclusively grown.
Other varieties, such as Pompei, Remus and
Varus, are experimented with, but so - far
none have equalled that wonderful purple-
colored New Guinea grass for richness in
sugar or yield of cane.
MY HUMBLE NEEDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 think that I should be content
If I could have the things I need.
Desire in me (though youth has spent
Its store) is moderate indeed.
I want a little cosy flat,
With seven snug spare rooms or so,
Where my best friends could doze or chat
When they have nowhere else to go.
For them I’d need a cellar, too,
Well stocked with necessary things—
The wines that laugh when mood 3 are blue,
And make of modest fellows kings.
We’d have a room for talk and song,
Where softly I (to spice their drink)
Would read them verses all day long!
(Oh, very kind of me, I think !)
But up against the roof, shut in
By double dooi-3 of steel, apart,
I’d keep, above the city’s din,
The sanctuary of my heart.
No sound of sordid day’s affrights
Should enter there, no frets and jar-
I’d have for rest on quiet nights
A flowered roof beneath the stars.
And you should kiss me every night
To sleep, your meed of sleep to win. .. .
You, drunk with rapture, shimmering white,
My dear, should dance the morning in.
Or, should night be forlorn and chill,
Maybe we’d seek your special nest—
So planned that joy could work his will,
And loveliness be loveliest.
A little nest demure and shy,
All guiltless of upholstered fuss.
There Monna Lisa, wise and sly, .
Should delicately smile at us.
I’d like some sculpture gleaming through
The shadows —naiads cool and slim.
We’d need a marble pool where you
And I could splash about and swim.
All through the drowsy afternoons
When passion lapses languorous;
And ladies on their honeymoons
Could sometimes come and swim with us.
We’d need food, service. .. .just enough....
One cannot live on love. Ah me,
If one could only live on love,
How very splendid life would be!
Item : to make our bliss secure,
A cordon-hleu or prince of cooks.
Item (to make l liss doubly sure) :
Just twenty thousand perfect books.
A few great etchings here and there
Would be essential, you'll admit.
Also, six housemaids—very fair
And comely, while I think of it.
We’d need some cash, as you‘ll agree,
For pocket-mor.ey (’ware the bleak
Beast, Impecuniosity !) —
A hundred pounds or so a week. .
I’m very fond of motoring;
A ear would add to our delight.
Most pleasant ’tis to speed and sing
Adown the moon-kist noon of night.
So we’d avoid the proser and
The loud perambulating eat,
And life would spacious be (but blandj
In our own flat.
MAC It I LAND.
SELWYN RIDER.

Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease. In
Anaemia—or bloodlessness—
the red corpuscles are more
or less deficient. Thus the
blood cannot provide suffi-
cient nourishment for the
body. Therefore the face
becomes white and “pasty”
—the eyes become dull and
“heavy”—and a feelirg of
intense weariness pervades
the whole system. To over-
come Anaemia, the blood
supply needs recharging with
red corpuscles. And it is
here that
The Wine of Life

power. Because, being a

Prevention is Better than Cure.
To resist colds, influenza, bronchitis, there is no-
thing better than a course of Angier’s Emulsion.
Its soothing, healing effects and its tonic invigorat-
ing influence upon all- the bodily functions make it
unequalled for the prevention of colds and catarrhal
affections. If the cold or cough has already com-
menced, Angier’s is the. best means of throwing it
off and repairing the damage it has caused. Phy-
sicians and hospitals have used Angier’s for over
twenty-five years.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The country was swept by the Phewsion
right enough. But who calls it a clean sweep ?
According to the Gospel of Party, the
price of victory at the ballot-box is eternal
negligence at the cashbox.
One of the consequences of borrowing
orgies is that the country is loaded up
suddenly with great swags of public works
which only very gradually pay for them-
selves, whereas, if the works were distri-
buted evenly over all the years, the public’s
load of new and consequently non-paying
railway lines, etc., would be evenly distri-
buted also. Between 1885 and ’5)l, accord-
ing to figures prepared for Commissioner
Tom Johnson, Vic.’s railway mileage in-
creased by nearly 90 p.c.; but the rural pro-
duction increased by only 47 p.c. The pro-
duction went on slowly increasing, however,
so that, between 1901 and ’l5, though the
mileage increased by only 16 p.c., the State’s
production increased by 77 p.c.
Before the elections the Liberal half of
the Phewsion publicly gave an assurance
that it had “swallowed preference to union-
ists” —it would do anything to win the war.
Apparently the war is won, because a fort-
night after polling-day the Argus began to
barrack loudly for the abolition of “the
pernicious system of preference to unionists
in Commonwealth employment.”
More charges are brewing in the Northern
Territory. Beckett, the enthusiastic ex-AGE
man who went up as Protector of Aborigines
and was afterwards deposed and made in-
spector, has been at loggerheads with N.T.
officialdom for some time. Lately the rumor
flew round that, as inspector, he was taking
a serious view of the alleged illegal granting
of permits to Chinese to employ abos., and
apparently to empty the wind out of his
sails he was suspended. The population of
the N.T. consists largely of public servants;
and GUruth the horse-doctor —who never
before had the handling of manj men—has
got them all at cross-purposes.
The Board of Inquiry into the Defence
Department is still moving up and down
between Brisbane and Melbourne cleaning
up the mess that Pearce and his predecessor
Millen didn’t prevent. Apparently the whole
duty of a Minister now is to make more or
less eloquent speeches while his Department
gets into a tangle, and then to appoint
somebody whose name even is scarcely known
to unravel it. Some day, when the people
realise the enormous importance of adminis-
tration, the fact that a man can make more
or less eloquent speeches will be regarded as
a matter for grave suspicion.
THINGS MIGHT BE WORSE.
MR. BOWYAING: “Blowed if I see why a
woman should get a man’s wages!”
MR. PECKET ( sadly ): “My friend, let her
have them if she works for them. My
wife usually gets mine, and I have to
do the working.”

ouglit to be a quick but serious inquiry
whether the Dorrigo should not be connected
nf i, Fo r two or three years the
Lands and Agricultural Departments
struggled to get the Dorrigo settled, holding
out definite promises of an early railway.
Scores of men went up into that big timber
country, and now they can't get even a bag
of maize to market, and are, some of them,
at the point of starvation. Prima facie, a
far stronger case is made out for honoring
the State promise to the Dorrigo settlers
than for joining up the scattered fragments
of the North Coast line.
Seeing that a Vic. County Court jury
decided that Leo Nelken, of Melbourne, is
an Austrian Jew and an alien enemy, it
would be interesting to discover what
another jury would say about those respon-
sible for employing the said Nelken as a
“confidential messenger” or secret-service
agent to the Income Tax department of the
Vic. Treasury. Wasn’t there a Christian
German or even a Turk available?
NOT HIS VISITING SUIT.
Many of the Australians had not time to dress,
but came out clad only in their shirts. Some lay all
night on the wet ground picking off Germans. —

REGINALD: “ ’Struth, Adolphus , I ’ope they
catches up to us with our trousers. I'd
hate to ’ave' to march into Berlin like

Certainly there ought to be a censorship
of ordinary State matters. That would have
stopped the Age from showing the nature
of Premier Peacock’s administration by
observing that he and some of his Ministers
“expressed surprise at the magnitude of the
new railway workshops at Bendigo.” What
would the shareholders in (for example)
the Broken Hill Prop. Co. say if the chair-
man of directors, after taking a glance at
the Newcastle steel works, made a similar
remark? And how long would he continue
chairman?
Australia, hasn’t yet half realised the
importance of roads. At a recent confer-
ence in South Gippsland a local farmer-vVho
had kept count declared that 80 per cent,
of the hill-settlers had given up their blocks
because of the bad. tracks to market. Land
around Toora was said to return about 30s.
an acre yearly, which was just about half of
what good roads would make it.
If the Commonwealth Government will
not and the State Governments can not
paid for, all the Stock Exchanges
has been commandeered but not
finance the farmers whose wheat
ought to quote the certificates, and
thus ensure for the hard-up farmer
a reasonable price if he has to sell.
The other day, simply because
there was no settled market in
Sydney for these wheat certificates,
c#d sales were being made at Is.
OM., while in Victoria, where the
business is better understood, Is.
3,}d. was being paid. That is for
last season’s wheat, on which so
far the Government has paid only
2s. 6d. For the previous year’s
crop-certificates as little as Bd. per
bushel was paid the hard-up farmer
not long ago. Since then there has
been a payment of 6d. from the
pool, and another 7d. or more is to
come—anyway, the certificates are
now saleable at 7d. Which shows
how, in the absence of a regular
market. Cocky was bled over last year’s crop
just is he is being bled over this year's.
This is no time for throwing money away;
and the States are doing a whole lot of it
by pensioning off men who are quite fit for
work. In N. S. Wales, for instance, the
policeman must retire at 60; find though
John Hop at 61 may not be much of a suc-
cess at pursuing the swift burglar, there is
plenty of police work that he can do, and
mostly do better than the inexperienced
youngster. Just at present we cannot afford
to pay two hale men for doing one job—
one as a pensioner out of uniform and
another as a policeman in it.
The first great battle between the rival
forces of the Phewsion party is to rage
around the question of a new War Minister.
In the voice of a conqueror holding his
victim up to obloquy, the Argus cries: —
If Mr. Justice Higgins ha's his way a strict cen-
sorship will be placed upon the press in respect to
all matters connected with industrial disputes which
may eventually come before the Arbitration Court.
Well, who is to blame for that? Even the
fattest and most constant readers of the
Argus must be mostly not too stupid to
grasp the fact that in all disputes between
workers and employers the daily papers are
the bystanders who say things calculated to
set the wranglers fighting.
One of the first steps taken by the Federal
Government towards winning the w r ar was
“a modification of the practice of giving pre-
ference to unionists.” It would have been
more decent to have modified it before the
elections, not immediately after them. From
the public point of view the practice has
been rotten for a long while past. The first
order giving preference was part of a clear
bargain. In return for unionists undertaking
not to dislocate industry by striking, the
Courts ordered that they should be given
preference, other things being equal. As
soon as they insisted on their right to strike,
in spite.of arbitration award,s, unions should
in decency have given up their claim to pre-
ference.
“Wig”: Learned brother Glynn, believing
that “there never was a time when the
management of the finances required more
care and temperance,” says the insistent call
is for economy. Then Glynn's Government,
with an Inter-State Commission on its
hands, appoints a Luxuries Board to find
out things which the Commission ought to
know as well as it does the time o’ day.
To maintain the Commission in the idleness
of the past two or three years is a wicked
crime. • Swinburne, certainly, has been giv-
ing some help to the Government in another
direction, and Lockyer is to serve on the
Luxuries Board; but what about the staff
and_ the expensive quarters in East Mel-
bourne and the learned chairman who has
done nothing of late, so far as the public
knows, except translate Italian plays and
write a delightful guide to Spain?
According to present arrangements Vic.
Premier Peacock will have the novel experi-
ence of fighting for his seat at next State
elections: it has long been a scandal that
he has usually been unopposed for Allandale.
There are at least six reasons why the old
tactician should be dropped out of the
House, and fully 60 for pushing him out of
the Premiership. One of the minor con-
siderations is the Ministry’s subservience to
Ikey Mo. At last election time a majority of
the members w.ere committed to support tote
legislation ; yet Peacock refused to introduce
a bill, and a stranger and even more sinister
thing is that no private member tackled the
matter.
HIS REDEEMING FEATURE.
“Pa will he glad to hear you are a poet.”
“Ah, like you, then, he adores poetry?”
“Not exactly. You see, the last man he
didn’t like making love to me was a
pugilist, and Pa tried to throw him
downstairs.”
There was an inter-Ally conference in
Rome the other day, which “approved” of
measures to crush the “German system of
trade, espionage and corruption.” That’s all
right; but what measures are being taken to
crush this country’s share of it? Every ad-
vertisement canvasser knows that a lot of
the old German trade has merely adopted an
American disguise, pro tern., and is flourish-
ing more than ever.
NOT TOO BAD.
JEALOUS ONE: “You, seem to know a dread-
ful lot of soldiers.”
FLIGHTY ONE: “Dreadful! Indeed, they’re
not. They're all very nice ones.”
NVestralia is at last beginning to take a
serious view of its position. A strike which
threatened at Kalgoorlie has been averted
only by both parties realising that the situa-
tion isn’t one to be played with. Miners —
thousands of ’ them —see that costs are
already much too high to allow most of the
mines to pay; and when the mineowners’
rep. is honest he mostly admits that, taking
the cost of living into account, the miner
gets little enough pay as it is—or too little.
That brings both parties up against the real
problem—how to reduce the cost of living.
Unfortunately, when an Arbitration Court
deals with, say, a miners’ case, it can’t order
that, to reduce the cost of living, 10,000
parasites sliall be put to hard labor and a
thousand or so hard-borrowing politicians
shall be warned off lOU’s for the rest of
their days. Yet until these things happen
the cost of living will be bloated.
In view of that voting paper and the
figures, which is it —the trench vote or the
stench vote?
The great test of German opinion on the
National Constitution will come when the
Kaiser presently quarrels with Hindenberg.
It is bound to come. A Prussian section of
the Independent Committee for Peace has
addressed a petition to Hindenberg—not to
the crowned god—asking for various annexa-
t'ons, including certain iron-ore regions in
France, and “large lands for colonisation in
Russia.’’ The Kaiser is not likely to put up
with that sort of rivalry; in fact, he can’t
maintain his War-lordship under such condi
tions. Either he or Hindenberg must figure
as the god of annexation, and the nation will
have to decide between them. Military con-
stitutional government will then be on its
trial; and if there be any revolutionary
spirit in-the intensely organised Huns it will
show itself.
The Vic. Government, on the advice
of Railway Commissioner E. B. Jones,
approved by visiting expert Tom' Johnson,
propbses to put the finances of its
railways on a sounder basis by the
simple device of raising freights. It
looks easy; but it would be easier if the
roads were worse. When this freight-raising
specific was tried on a large scale a few
decades ago the experiment "was a rank
failure because of the road-competition which
sprang up—and remained sprung-up long-
after the railway rates slumped again. The
introduction of high railway freights nowa-
days,-with better roads and any quantity of
motor vehicles to run on them, seems fore-
doomed. The Commissioners may not know
it, but bullock-teams like gran’pa drove are
still pursuing freights on bush roads within
30 miles of Melbourne, and they will swarm
out on the main roads again as soon as an
increase of railway rates gives them the
office.

COUGH MIXTURE
NEW DESIGN AND TRADE MAR* ADOPTED 1916
As a set-off to its horrors, the great war has brought into relief many fine examples
of heroic patriotism. A noteworthy case is furnished by the Clunc family, of Waverley.
When they heard their country’s call all the boys responded. Lieut. George • Clune went
across to France from America with the American Ambulance; Private Francis Clune
proceeded to Gallipoli, from Australia. Both have been invalided home. Their brother
Jack, the well-known lightweight boxer, who was in America, returned to Australia in
order that he might don khaki and fill one of the gaps caused by the retirement of his
two brothers from the front, and on May 10 he sailed as a company-sergeant-major.
Mrs. Clune is justly proud of her boys, and so arc all true Australians.
We have received hundreds of letters from mothers expressing their thanks for the
benefit their soldier sons had derived from Heenzo. The following one from the mother
of the Fighting Clunes is of especial interest.

NOTIONS
The old saw that many a true word may be
spoken in jest wasn’t in the mind of this page a
week or two ago when it guessed the time was
getting ripe to hear of Darcy moving off again. Last
week the cable told us of the young man’s death ;
and the writer is very sorry for it. When he died at
Memphis (U.S.A.) last week the youngster was only
in his 22nd year. His passing from the limelight was
almost as sudden as his arrival. About four years
ago he bashed his way into notice among the smaller
try, and was spoken of as likely to develop into a
battler with the big ’uns. The forecast scored a
bull's-eye. His first important scrap—it was with
Fritz Holland—was nothing to get excited about.
The kid was very raw. But b\ r the time he inter-
viewed Gus Christie, a Yankee of moderate renown,
at the Sydney Stadium three or four months later,
Dave Smith had taught him something. Darcv won
well, and from them onward continued to pas's over
assault and battery to ’em all. If he was not tech-
nically the middleweight champion of the world he
certainly had a better claim to be considered the
proprietor of the distinction than anyone else. Darcy
was a natural pug, in the same way as some men
are natural runners or jumpers or wrastlers. He
was a rate puncher.
There were any number of better boxers than
Darcy. There were some harder wallopers. What
made him was his great speed, his extraordinary
pertinacity, his abnormal strength, and his instinctive
use of the offensive for defensive purposes. He had
wonderful vitality. This writer watched him in all his
fights and cannot recall having once seen him marked
or even hurt, or travelling on the reverse gear. Les
O’Donnell hit him perhaps the hardest clout he ever
got. It didn’t matter, though it would have dropped
most men. McGoorty caught him a solid wallop flush
to the jaw. It is a solemn fact that Darcy did not
notice it —did not falter an instant in the execu-
tion of what he proposed to do. Buck Crouse gave
him a smack of great violence. It seriously annoyed
him. What happened to Buck in the next minute or
so is a shame to think of. It is the literal truth
that in not one of the fights Darcy had after emerg-
ing from the ruck, did the other fellow at any stage
of the journey look like a winner or after the pre-
liminary skirmish feci like one. No reasonable
ground existed for supposing; that any one of the
topnoteh middleweiglits in Yankeeland could beat
him or even cut even with him. This writer is con-
vinced that, if everything was on the level, Darcy
would have trimmed them all, and quickly, too. And
until he got the unquestioned title no one would
have had enough money to persuade him to go down.
Afterwards—well, the writer would not have been
so sure. Clean, decent young fellow though he was, the
game which Darcy butted into spoils them all, and
he had some grave defects of character. They were
all crystallised in his flight from Australia.
* * * ♦
“Mujik”: The man who took the most
sustained hiding from Darcy and stood most bravely
up to what was coming to him was Frank Lougkrey,
the American welter who used to start operations by
blessing himself with the sign of the Cross. Loughrey
was horribly punished. Darcv got tired of punching
him, and towards the end eased off and let the little
fellow see the journey through. Of the numerous
individuals who got into the ring with Darcy without
any enthusiasm, Alexander Costiea, the Roumanian,
and Jeff Smith are entitled to the benefit of
a dead-heat. Costiea was pallid with terror.
In his first fight Smith may have thought he
had a chance. He got out on a foul. In the second
fight the opening round scared him away from his
wits. He cut it cold. The foul was flagrantly delib-
erate. Later on Smith had the cast-iron nerve to
go about America shooting off dope about having
beaten Darcy. Smith, an absurdly over-rated man,
was really not in the same class as Darcy. Nor
were any of the others, even at their best. Darcy
pasted McGoorty as if he were a punching-bag, and
McGoorty is, or was then, one of the very best on
two legs. Probably the only confident pug Darcy
met was George Chip. George had seen Darcy and
Clabby together, with Clabby giving a hang-on and
cuddle exhibition. “If that’s Darcy I’ve got him
in the bag,” said George. But he got it square on
the point instead, after being made to look as cheap
as two cents. And now the argument can start
about whether Darcy would have beaten this or that
champion of the long-ago ; whether he was the equal
of Bob Fitzsimmons or Jim Hall or Dan Creedon ;
about what Ketchell would have done to him, and
how Mike Gibbons would have performed, and so
on.

If it is not true that topnoteh athletes
die in a greater hurry than other people, it looks
like it. Certainly an amazing number of such men
die young, and it is a singular thing that what seems
an altogether disproportionate multitude die of tuber-
cular disease of the bmgs. Many theories have been
advanced to account for this. One is that, after
periods of training, the trained person, being very
often a primitive sort of animal, plunges into an
orgy of excess—that in addition to placing his bodily
powers under heavy strain in one direction he clissi-.
pates his reserves. There may be something in this.
Tf there is, it incidentally makes hash of the notion
that training produces self-discipline. Of course,
some athletes retain their health and strength up to
an advanced age, but there undoubtedly seem to be
more ancient drapers than athletes. So also the
number of athletes who expire before middle age is
queer, for they were probably among the most vital
of their time. If one runs over the list of pugs and
runners who have fallen down early in the race
against Time, the total is depressing. Take the ease
of Darcv. From a life-insurance point of view he
belonged to a type that is very rare. No better
risk could have been taken, for physically he was
perfect, full of rude health, apparently good for a
century. This page often wonders whether there may
not be something devitalising in training methods.
Anyhow, Darcy makes the third of front-rank Aus-
tralian athletes to go off right in their prime.
Kieran and Searle were the others. In each case the
tussle with the winner was brief.
Dave Smith and Jimmy Clabby went back
to their old job of hitting one another on Saturday.
It happened at Sydney Stadium. The short and
simple story is that James had most pepper and
looked better than he might have done it he had
been spending the evening with someone who treated
him more disrespectfully. Dave is suffering a bit
from wear and tear these times. By the ninth inter-
lude James had the bacon within easy' reach, and
Dave stepped forth ready for the sacrificial wallop.
It came on the instalment plan, a hard left to the
jaw and an immediate deposit of the right to the
point. Whereupon David fell where many had fallen
before, and the seventh battle of the war was over.

Matty Smith and Herb McCoy met at
Brisbane on Saturday and carried out their contract.
Matthew relied on breaking out of a smother with
painful surprise attacks on McCoy’s loft. The Vic-
torian plugged along with intense sincerity of pur-
pose. A tasty uppercut in the thirteenth clash
decided the argument, for, although Matthew hank-
ered after suicide the following round, the referee
pushed him to the rear for a pick-me-up.
* * * *
The machine was used for the first time
at Rosehill on Saturday. There was a good betting
crowd in pursuit of winners, and by the end of the
day £3502 had been passed through the mill. This
means that the club derived a revenue of £lO5 with
which to pay the cost of manipulating the cash and
with what was left encourage the breeding of
thoroughbreds. Of course, this is just the same old
farce over again. Under these conditions the machine
is no use to anyone, so the incidental facts that it
was round at the back of the premises, that no one
could make head or tail of the figures in their rela-
tion to the probable dividend, and that there was a
great tiredness about the proceedings mattered
nothing one way or another. The first race started
off with an investment of £906. Then there was a
steady slump down to £454 on the last. The public
will never be satisfied with what is being offered
—and it looks as if nobody wants it to be.
* * * *
There were 28 runners in the Granville
Stakes at Rosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday, and as the
machine provided for only 20 there had to be some
bracketing. Among the nags that were not sighted
on the journey was Down South. But this didn’t
matter. Tiberius was driven home in front by
Bracken, and as he happened to be bracketed with
Down South, backers of the loser weighed in with
the supporters of the winner for £3 Bs. 6d., and all
was pleasantness. They never treat anyone that way
in Israel.
JIMMY HILL, featherweight champion pug.
Div : The tote dividend of £76 10s. for
10s., paid the other day at Maitland (N.S.W.) by
Orclad (a son of the 3050-guinea Orcus, who never
'von a race 1), was good, but by no means a record.
Kaluwiri returned 4:175 for 10s. when she took the
Trial Handicap at the W.A.T.C. meeting in June,
1912. Some big divvies for £l are: Antarctic,
Brownhill Handicap, Adelaide, Feb., 1900, £l2B
16s. ; Loch Shi.el, Hannan’s. Handicap, Kalgoorlie,
1907, £l3B 18s.; and Ranfurly, S.A.J.C. Goodwood
Handicap, 1900, £lOl 13s. But the absolute record
for Australia and probably the world was scored in
the same Goodwood Handicap in 1881 when D.O.D.
returned £836 10s.
The biggest surprise the man not right
inside had received at Rosehill (N.S.W.) for a long
time happened when Cisco charged to the front half*
wa’y down the straight on Saturday and won the
Auburn Handicap, one mile. Cisco is the property
of station-owner D. T. Watt, and had not been at
the right end for over two years, and this was his
first appearance on a track for about 18 months. The
last race he had won was the Ravvson Stakes in
1915, and earlier in the year he collared the A.J.C.
Anniversary Handicap. Prior to that his best—and
greatest—achievement was to win the A.J.C. Derby
of 1911. He is now eight years old. A couple of
years ago he was gelded to see if the change would
make him move more rapidly. He was got by the
imported' San Francisco out of that magnificent mare
Lady Wallace, who flourished most conspicuously
about 1905, in which year she landed the V.R.C.
Derby in a field of 10. There was not much money
for him on Saturday, but most of what there was
got on at 20’s and 15’s. Cuberic was backed down
to 5 to 2, but missed the 'bus by half a length.

The Grafton colt De Lyssa is furnishing
into a top-class welter neddy over sprint distances.
Within a few weeks he has won three races—one at
Newcastle, another on a course outside the Metropoli-
tan radius, and the third at Rosehill on Saturday.
De Lyssa captured the Flying- Welter in a field of
20. He finished in really brilliant style, and is a
good advertisement for his defunct sire Grafton. A
three-year-old, Dc Lyssa has not done an extra lot
of racing, and can be counted on to win again before
long, as the people behind him seem to have the
knack of selecting suitable races for him. He is in
the same stable as Heatherbrae. Galen, favorite for
Saturday’s event, led into the straight and looked a
winner, but closed up like a jack-knife. Galen is
the property of two Sydney jewellers, one of whom
was amateur champion bike rider of this continent,
first when the big wheel was the vogue and again in
the early days of the machine from which, if the
rider falls, he doesn't get bucked over the front in
the old style.
* * * *
The arrival of anything in the way of a
smart hurdler is an unusual event on Sydney "courses,
most of the nags getting over obstacles'there being a
poor lot. Coominga, winner at Rosehill on Satur-
day and runner-up to King Mostvn at Randwick a
week before,, may turn out worth considering as a
hurdler later on. He hasn’t mastered the jumping
part of the job properly yet, but can get along the
open spaces with _ considerable rapidity. Though his
jumping was poor on Saturday he won with a bit in
hand after setting up a new time record for the
course. Of the nine candidates in this race two ran
off, two fell and two others performed like mules.
* * * *
There was something doing on Saturday
among the ponies at Victoria Park (Sydney). At
Bathurst the week before the five-3'ear-old brown
mare Esmee H., by Rice (imp.)—Clarice, won a
double. Wherefore when the same animal was
noticed on the book at Victoria Park in the 14.1
Handicap the assembled punters leaped at Ikey in one
large mob, and Esmee 11. became a hot pot. Mean-
while the stewards heard a whisper and forthwith
commenced to ask pertinent questions about the
mare's identity. All they discovered was that no
one wanted to sign a declaration that the pony was
identical with the animal she was alleged to be. This
led to Esmee H. being arrested and handed over to
the police as a quadruped without lawful visible
means or something, all bets were declared ovff, totali-
sator investments handed back and 20 minutes allowed
for making fresh bets. Meanwhile the field, minus
Esmee H., were out at the starting-machine enjoy-
ing the cold, westerly wind, a circumstance which
caused the vets, to smile approvingly as they thought
of the fees to come for cough mixtures. More will
be heard about Esmee H. later on. The impounded
pony is a smart-looking little nag, bearing a very
marked resemblance to the well-known 14.1 pony
Fredofleld.

The stipes of the S.A.J.C. have given a
nasty jar to the numerous owners who are never
satisfied with their moke's running unless it runs in
first. Owner Burchell lodged a complaint about the
bad failure of his horse, The Navy, in a steeplechase,
alleging that Powell, the boy on top, was not a
trier. The stipes found that the one to blame was
the animal underneath, and, having ordered Burchell
to pay the costs of the inquiry, reported the case to
the S.A.J.C. committee.

A Melbourne man tells an affecting story
of the old days of Miller’s sweeps. He was partner
with a solemn citizen in a ticket that drew a 41900
prize, and the valuable document was in his posses-
sion. The other fellow, being superintendent of a
Sunday-school, would have nothing to do with the
actual buying of the chance. But the more sinful
partner was going to Geelong for the day, so he
left their prize certificate in charge of the Sunday-
school teacher. That was the last he saw of the
good man. Obadiah vanished from Melbourne and
left the Sunday-school lamenting. Moral: Trust no
worker in the vineyard to resist' a temptation that
runs well into three figures.
* * * *
A fine athlete was Captain ,T. IT. Slater,
killed recently in action. Among manv running
events he captured in Victoria was the 220yds.
amateur championship, from Burton and E. H. Kelly.
For years he was one of the props of the Geelong
football team. His speed, fine physique and dex-
terous kicking made him an exceptional “centre”
Player. There have been few, if any, better in that
position.
Lieut. Ralph Robertson, killed in France,
was a, star in the Australian game of football. In
Victoria he pulled on a jersey with St. Hilda; later,
in Sydney, he did as'much as any two other enthusi-
asts to put the bounce-and-kick game on its legs.
“Robbo” captained East Sydney and North Sydney
for over 11 years, and also had charge of N.S.W.
rep. teams in Melbourne. (1908), Adelaide (1911)
and Svdney (1914). When war-clouds burst he
shouldered a rifle to Rabaul : afterwards he hied off
to England and joined the Flving Corps. He spent
all but two of 37 years of life in Australia, and in
both sport and business left a clean trail.
* * * *
“C.C.H.” ; Football under Australian rules,
as played in Sydney, is a very different thing from
the game as you see it across the Murray. There is
not the same dash and vigor in Sydney, and as a
spectacle the play loses much in consequence. In
the matches I have seen there was some good indi-
vidual play, but concerted work was missing.
Further, a number of the players seemed to think they
were in for a high-kicking competition. The low,
skimming kick whieh made Collingwood famous and
was copied by all the other Melbourne teams, is not
in evidence in Sydney at all.
*"* * *
A. Croall, who picked up the Flemington
(Vic.) £5O professional sprint last week, made a
big effort not long since to get to the Front. After
about five months in camp he was discharged for
having an unsound lung. Whatever else may be the
matter there doesn’t seem much wrong with his legs,
anvway, for they moved fast enough to defeat the
hot-pot Richards and four others in the final. Saw-
bones might alter his opinion if Croall sprinted along
again.
* * * *
“Fed” : Mention of veteran Frank Hewitt
(B. 17/5/’l7) reminds me. Over half a century
ago he was a dazzler. In 1865 he whizzed over
142 yards in 13fsec. at Sheffield (Eng.). This is
still the best for that distance. His s]see, over 50
yards at Norwich (Eng.), in ’66, held the slate
until A. F. Duffey (America) came along 37 years
later. Hewitt’s best time-effort in Australasia was
880 yards in lmin. at Christchurch (M.L.) in
1871. This was not beaten until an amateur, J. E.
Meredith, registered lmin. 524 sec. at Stockholm in
1912. Hewitt was a proficient watchholdev, and when
he clocked a “go” the ’eads rarely lost their silver.
Still vigorous at 74, he is one of few whom hard
training failed to puncture somewhere.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: It all depends on how a man
feels on the day. A few years ago Jack Applit raced
Bob Watson over 200 yards in 19(see. The Mait-
land miners were backing Bob that time and were
annoyed. A week or two later the pair had another
go, and the miners this time put their dough on
John. But the other fellow won in 22sec., just
because Annlit was not feeling too well that day.
In fact, when he heard the compliments of the
plungers he was positively ill.

How about Sydney Grammar for world’s
champion high scores at Rugby? The other week it
defeated Scots’ College by 101 to nil. Former scores
have been 52-0 v. Newington, 53-0 v. Church of
England Grammar. 25-6 v. St. Joseph’s. This adds
up to 231 points against 6.

“W..T.H.”: Archbishop Carr was a fair
hand with the cue. One night years ago, at the
palace on Eastern Hill, he was having a friendly
game with dead-and-gone Nicholas Fitzgerald, when
he accomplished a startling stroke, making his ball
jump over his opponent’s. “Ah, your Grace,” re-
marked Fitzgerald, “a canonical trick !”
A heavy draught gelding yarded at Xarro-
mine (N.S.W.) recently was claimed to be the biggest
horse in the world. He was bred at Belaringar
station, stood up 20 hands liin. on his bare feet, and
was built in proportion. This curio was being sent
to Sydney for exhibition purposes, but objected so
strongly to the train-journey that he injured himself
fatally during the trip. It was a sad blow to the
poor father, a member of the draught aristocracy
named Lord Lyons.
* * * *-
• Rarely has ye game of Bowls produced
so many surprises as in Sydney this season. In the
singles championship an outsider. Bent, came from
among the coal heaps at Corrimal and won the title
from parson S._R. Reid (Drummoyne) in 35 heads
by 31 —25. In the rink championship there is the
same kind of tale. On Saturday, teams led bv Bill
Hart (Parramatta), Thorne (Victoria Park), J.
Harrison (Ashfleld) and others with dreams of win-
ning the title went down with a crash, and half a
dozen metropolitan teams and one each from Western
and South Coast are left to worry over the jack on
June 4.
* * * *
“E S.S.”: Why is it that no attempt is
made to domesticate our wild chicks and geese?
Nearly all of them find ready sale when shot, and
at good prices. They are easily-enough tamed, as
the black ducks in Sydney Botanical Garden testifv.
The pied goose, now rare in settled coastal districts
where it was once very plentiful, is well worthy of
preservation. It is the largest of the wild geese,
a semi-palmated, black-and-white bird, whose hooked
beak is surmounted by a knob. It is easily reared.
The gnaroo, or maned goose, usually called wood
duck, is a shier bird. Like the pigmy geese of the
North, it is only about the size of a wild duck, but
its coloration makes it most attractive, and it is a
table dainty. The pink-eared duck, blue-billed
duck, shoveller, wymbin (pink-eyed duck), the
perna or mountain duck, and the mardo or Rajah
sheldrake are all attractive in appearance, and world
make splendid additions to the poultry flock. The
simplest way to domesticate them is to obtain the
eggs from the swamps in the breeding season and
place them under a broody hen, mixing the clutches
with a few ordinary duck or goose eggs, as the case
may be. With the exception of the mountain duck,
they are all excellent table birds.
* * * *
“Key-oli”: No, the rifle-fish is not a rarity,
as “Ossian” (B. 24/6/T7) could find out if he went
to N.Q. I have caught him many times as
much as 150 miles west of Chillagoe, in the deep
pools along the river-beds at Etheridge. The rifle-
fish is always at home with the catfish, and as a
change from salted rations is not too bad.
* * * *'
“V.” : Several rivers of the eastern water-
shed of N. S. Wales contain the mountain minnow,
or- mountain trout ( Galexa), known loeallv as
“blaekflsh,” though it is no relation of the weed-
feeder of the salt water. Besides being found in
the streams at the source of the Snowv River (such
as the Eucumbene and Thredbo), the blaekflsh
haunts deep pools in the Snowy itself, and in the
Delegate River of southern Monaro, hut in most
other southern affluents of the Snowv it is unac-
countably absent. It is a well-flavored little fish,
very fine in scale and a free biter when in the
mood. A rod is not indispensable, as in the case
of the more aristocratic imported trout. Worms
are the best bait. The minnow runs to about Sin.
in maximum length. Another of the family, a nar-
row, diaphanous fish, running to about 6in. in
length, haunts the pools of small creeks and water-
courses on the eastern coast of N. S: Wales, and
some of the rivers in that quarter. It is known as
the Sydney minnow.
* * * *
“Tam O’Shan ter”: I wish a heavy hand
would fall upon those wholesale “layline” snapper
poachers that infest parts of the ‘ North Coast
(N.S.W.). The fish domiciles himself on the rocky reefs
and can be caught on handlines, two and three at
a time, with mullet bait. But this method is too
slow for some people. So a lay-line, up to a mile
long and with about a thousand baits attached, is
stretched along the reef and left over night connected
to floating kerosene-tins, which take a prominent
place in the outfit. Frequently the catch gets
entangled among the locks and the cable has
to be cut and the lot left to perish. The decaying
bodies entice the sharks, and the quick and the dead
snapper are soon demolished. In this way many good
fishing grounds are being transformed into shark
bases. The only consolation about the tiling is" that
Britishers are not the offenders.
* * * *
“T.W.”: There are some valuable mem-
bers of the sea-perch family in Australian waters —
the dusky perch, for instance, dark grey-black in color
with opaque white belly. 1 have hooked this fine food
on rocky grounds off the South Coast. (N.S.W.),
usually in the vicinity of bumboras or sunken reefs.
My catch, as a, rule, ran to about 18in., but other speci-
mens are said to have measured fully 3ft. The dorsal
and anal fins are so peculiar in formation that the
fish appeal’s to have three tails. I have found the
dusky perch bite well to crab-bait, but cungevoi and
shellfish, such as limpets and mutton-fish, will also
serve. Flesh-bait is apparently not included in the
menu of the species.
* * * *
“Flattie”: If you want to go drifting for
flathead and need bait the easiest way to get some in
any of the estuaries on the N. S. Wales coast is to
put a piece of bread in a pickle-bottle and place it
on a sandflat at high tide. In warm weather, when
the mullet are about, the rush to commit suicide is
so strong that the small ones are jambed in the
neck of the bottle. These juveniles make fine bait
if the Fisheries inspector is looking the other way.

This co. is in competition with the most pro-
gressive Public Trust Office iii this hemi-
sphere—or perhaps in any. And it is more
than progressive. Generally, when the Fat-
man can choose between private and public
enterprise, he takes the former: it is a
matter of principle or prejudice, whichever
you like. It is this that makes the future of
the trustee co. in general look good not-
withstanding the arrival of public trust
offices. But, somehow, the Maoriland Public
Trust Office has got the Fatman saying good
things about it; aud that has made the way
of the private competitor pretty hard. Ten
years ago this co. had estates worth
f 1,342,310 in hand; to-day the total is
£2,396,643 —barely a million more. Still, if
the haul isn’t large the fish is sweet; and,
having had no set-backs, it has been able to
put by something so steadily that the re-
serves are £14,752 as against £lO,OOO of
capital. So the 15 p.c. divs. are nowadays
fairly easy. Last year, for instance, interest
and discount supplied all but £254 of it.
What sort of investments the co. has for its
own funds is not, however, certain. The
balance-sheet makes one bundle of practi-
cally the lot, and labels it “Mortgages and
debentures.”

Broken Hill Block 14 contipues to chase
fragments of carbonate ore that were over-
looked in earlier days. It has been living
on these gleanings for more than a dozen
years. The results are naturally erratic:
they have given shareholders as much as- 4s.
in some years and 2s. 6d. as recently as
1912; but in the past 12 months, notwith-
standing high prices of metals, Is. only has
been managed—6d. in each half. That of
course is in addition to the 10 p.c. divs. on
pref. shares. (These shares first take their
10 p.c. and then come in on equal terms
with the ordinaries.) To pay the ordinaries
even Is. in the past year the surplus of
more or less liquid assets has had to be
carved down from £62.997 to £57,807. The
pottering about has given the following ton-
nage in the last few terms:—
Sept., ’l3 .. 6957 Sent., ’l5 .. 4339
Mar., ’l4 .. 6513 Mar., ’l6 .. 2575
Sept., ’l4 . . 5062 | Sept., ’l6 . . 4335
Mar., ’l5 .. 4608 Mar., ’l7 .. 3189
Cut out the March, ’l6, term, because
of the strike that knocked the bottom
out of that half-year, and it will be seen
that during this four-year period there has
been a continuous fall in output. Mean-
time costs for the mere finding and mining
of this ore have climbed up to £3 os. Bd. per
ton. Last half-year’s gross profit (includ-
ing interest earnings) was £4717; and
depreciation has to come off that.
Block 14 has perhaps 300,000 tons of sul-
phides ; and this ore Block 10 has under-
taken to treat at the rate of 1000 tons a
week “on terms satisfactory to both parties.”
Block 10 is now putting up a flotation plant
to handle the tailings from this and its own
ore. Iu addition to these sulphides and
whatever more carbonates it may get, Block
14, as before mentioned, has £57,807 of
more or less liquid assets —all really verv
liquid except as to £12,500 in “shares in
other cos.” It is understood that £12,000
'of this is represented by 40,000 shares in
the King Island Scheelite Co. “There is,”
the directors say, “a good market for this
co.’s products, which are urgently required
for war purposes, and it is anticipated that
production will commence about September
next.” _ It is to be hoped the co. has more
luck with this than with its previous plunge
into “outside” metals. It sent the Block
14 Torrington Co. on the hunt for wolfram
and bismuth; and shai’eholders have got
nothing but a little very mild excitement out
of it.

“M.C.”: Tasmanian Metal Extraction has
overcome some at least of the technical diffi-
culties of obtaining zinc in solution and sub-
sequently recovering the pure metal by elec-
trolysis. Professor Turner, of Birmingham
(Eng.), reports very favorably on this pro-
cess for recovering zinc from complex ore,
and optimistically states that a ton of zinc
in the form of sulphate can •be obtained as
solution for £lO. He also calculates the
electrical h.p. required to deposit zinc in
marketable form, and describes a simple sys-
tem of treatment. But the process has still to
be worked out in a commercial way.
# * * *
“L. 0.”: The person who desires to live by
promoting questionable mining propositions
must cultivate a proper sense of proportion,
as , was once exemplified at Lucknow
(N.S.W.). An enterprising individual ex-
hibited some beautiful specimens of gold-
bearing ore, together with an alluring story
of how he had discovered a nice patch of
similar stone in a paddock, and had covered
it over again until he could get a few people
to pool £lO each for its further development.
The scheme was just crystallising into finan-
cial success, when he added that he knew it
was still unknown to a covetous world by
reason of his having been out there the day
before with a horse and dray for a load of
wood. And then it was that one of the pro-
spective syndicate blew in with the' remark
that if he was such a fool as to bring in a
load of wood instead of a ton of such stone
w’hen he was out there with his horse and
dray and wanted money, he wasn’t going to
get any £lO from him. With one accord the
others also hastily reconsidered their deci-
sion. and the mine was left on the vendor’s
hands.

l lie ninth child i have used
them for, besides recommend-
ing them to inanv of - mv
friends, who all say what a
boon they are. My baby is
now six months old, and 1
have given him the powders
•since he was .one month old.
All my children are alive ami
well. Yours respectfullv,
Mrs. J. 13. JOLLY."

THERE is something most satisfaetorv about
having on the right shoes for the occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent leather, which alwavs
looks Well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one’s spring suit or
summer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Rostock shoos, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality whi< h
sets them apart amongst ready-made shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of .shoes made specially to measure.

Only know that it has been stringing people on to
spend money these last 2b years. .. .Yar: Dead sure
about those potato-pickers’ wages, are you?....Gun
Sun: We’ll read anything..'. .G.S.O’H.: Thanks: will
send it to the perpetrator.... Lex: Your pen-name
is worthless to the Accountant... .T.0.P.: “But 1
knew, though afar, 1 was near, so near, to the
shambles Desire had born.” Great; but why didn't
you send the cypher code ?.... F.G.8.: “A Jam-
boree” is a bit incoherent, but your kind hopes for
the Kaiser are simple and direct :—-
And may you tramp through Vustrnliun bush
To the roughest shearing shed,
Where the. rouseabouts will torment you
Till you nearly drop down dead.
And may the windy spasms
Through your bowels dart.
And may your feet be blistered
Before you make a start.
. ...8.D.: Doesn’t convince enough to raise a smile.
....Grain o’ Sand: Rhymed verse poor. The other
is so easy to do in a sort of way that it hardly
matters. Still, you have the verse sense; and that's
a lot. Keep going. .. .E.E.E.: Lame sort of “appeal”
that. . . .F.S.W.T.: “Fred” is dreary and ungram-
matical.... Pam : Not much promise in it. ...Lela
M.: N 0.... Gluepot:_ Vcly young'. .. .W.F.: Too long
for interest... .Cooee Restaurant: Sloppy ditty, mostly
bad rhymes. .. .Esbee: Moves very heavily... .E.S.:
“Soldier’s Life” goes very bumpily... .D.F.F.: One
verse
And now there’s this one. Rather far?
Dear love, you’ve left the gate ajar.
You can’t stand it neither?
Mother did not like it either —
Says the distance is too great
For her diurnal visit and tea.
You'll take it? Well, of all insensible
And incomprehensible
Beings called men,
Commend me to thee!
. ...H.E.R.: “The Message” doesn't quite get there.
. ...R.M.: “Attar of Roses” too thin. .. . V.G.V.:
Verse won’t do. Repairs wrought by “sluggard
peace” are a novelty.... H'.H.D.: Nothing in it but
the dialect; and that can’t carry it....E.C.:
Ungrammatical melodrama... .C.C.D.: “Alice” too
crude. ... A.M.: “Pro Patria” narrowly misses being-
classed as a shocking example. .. .Trier: Rejected
because it is deadly dull. . . .M.L.: “True Love” very
slight,. .. .G.F.R.: Sloppy writing and no yarn....
I VS.: Doesn't make a story.... W.M.: “Abdication”
lacks force and distinction.... M.L.: Not quite....
F.D.: They’re not “poems,” but rather weak attempts
at commonplace versifying... .P.8.P.: Can you ex-
plain how “Iler Child*’ is correct verse, while “Win-
the-War" seems to indicate that you don’t know
verse from a leg of pork? M.B.J. : It goes feebly.
. ...A.M.W.: “Spell of Fei” doesn't hit u 5....
11.E.E.: Hardly our style. Did they have condensed
milk in the ’thirties?- Mansfield: Awful Ajem:
Coals to Newcastle; and ungrammatical fuel at that.
.. . .R.A.8.: A person who tries to make thin verse
on “Mothers’ Day” is sure to fall down at his first
rhyme Blank File: It doesn’t exactly thrill us.
. ...R.G.H.: You tried for something subtle but
only succeeded in being dull. . . .Kurrawong: No. . . .
Khaki: “White Feather Rond” is a feeble flutter in
pursuit of a hefty curse. .. .C.J.W.: Verse weak;
point 5ma11.... Clancy : Not enough yarn. . ..Tyrone:

that? E.J.: The humors of English ineptitude
want stronger handling for Australian readers
J.C.S.: “Gumleaf” verse no n5e....8.M.: Too
obscure. Tf we want sonnets at all, it is those with
a direct appeal to .others besides the patient student.
II. V.: The funeral of that cat, took place in this
column weeks ago; and the beast isn't any more
fragrant for resurrection.... A.L.Me.: Good letter :
Imt all told so often before 5.1. R.-: Not quite"
You know what verse is. but lack freshness. • Any-
how, you can't say “Tf still it leaves you and T
together’... .P.W.T.: Verse reckless of rhvme, mean-
ing and metre....G.M.G.: As brilliant as a box of
soap L.P.: Do you mean it for prose or verse?

You can’t wash away all your artistic sins
C.S.D.: Weak satire.. . .G.H.D.: They would not
turn down a “prospective” for lack of a kind word.
There is nothing remarkable about it... L.M.:
You’re not Dana Gibson’s star pupil. .. .G.H.J.:
Sour little figures Bruce C. S.: An old grin and
the drawing looks very English D.L.A.: Approval
rushed up a side street when it saw this contribu-
tion coming M.G.W.: Nothin’ doin’ Tom H.:
Too stiff.
“Adelaide”: There is food for a lot of
thought in the annual report of the Babies’
Aid Society of S.A. —or any other big-
hearted body of the same kind. Fine work
is done in welcoming the little immigrant,
and giving him or her a decent chance at
starting. The food for thought arrives with
a few cases "cited as particularly calling for
assistance, and which don’t attain to public
notice except in reports of this kind. “Hus-
band an invalid, done no regular work for
three years; six children; eldest daughter
delicate.” “Father receives invalid pension
(mother earns 12s. a week by washing) ;
four other, children.’”. Population is a great
Tteed. of course; but is this just the kind of
immigrant Australia wants?

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

Many Seasons-One Roofing!
THE weather changes your roof
never. Roofing laid now must bear the
brunt of the rainy season —as well as resist the broil-
ing heat of the long, hot summer days. To satisfy, roofing
must be ready to meet every weather change —season after
season —never buckling, never creeping, never cracking.
Certain-teed Roofing
meets all these requirements. It is unaffected by
the heat of the sun. It is absolutely and permanently
water-tight. Made of felt and scientifically-blended asphalts,
it does not melt or run, nor does it dry out. Easily obtainable,
easily applied, most economical —fully guaranteed by the
manufacturers.

teach us the true art of

SHAVING CREAM
is the result of three years of study and experi-
ment in search of the ideal shaving medium.
This “cream” possesses the remarkable
quality of softening the toughest beard —no
hot water or “rubbing in” being necessary—the
shaving brush is sufficient to work up a thick
creamy lather that does not dry quickly, but
remains moist to permit of a leisurely shave.

almost every country in the world, in large cities,
small towns or in the country this car is being more
widely bought than ever before.

IN every wav it is worthy of the good opinion of the
world.

quality, better engineering design, more comfort, better
upholstery and equipment, better finish than he ever
dreamed was possible at the price.

Joe Lesimi. the one-time “Clermont
Comet,” is now running a Phewsion organ
at Dubbo (N.S.W.), much to the delight of
Brisbane Courier, which quotes his anti-
Labor coruscations with immense gusto.
Joe used to sit beside Independent Murphy-
after he left the Queensland Labor party,
but the party of tvyo split on a question of
tactics, and Joe the Iconoclast was finally
replaced by ex-parson Adamson, Now
Adamson has gone Murphy is again a party
unto himself, and the strictest discipline pre-
vails in the organisation.
“Norbell”: On the Downs, where the
mouse invasion is pretty solid, the favorite
trap is a common beer-bottle (empty), with
a piece of cheese stuck in the neck instead
of a cork. The bottle is laid on its side on
a table or chair with the neck projecting
into space, like a cannon. A piece of cloth
is wrapped round the bottom of the trap to
prevent rolling and to give the moyse a
foothold. The animal climbs over the cloth
and tries to Blondin out on the neck of the
bottle to get the cheese. Invariably he slips
and falls into the basin of water waiting on
the floor beneath. They thus catch—well,
more than you’d believe.
A. H. W. Cunningham, chairman of the
Wangaratta Shire Council, has been in Bris-
bane arranging with Minister for Lands
Hunter for the opening up of 170,000 acres
of good pastoral country on the Suttor
River to start returned men at cattle-raising.
Already the Bowen people have got enough
stock on hand to give the project a decent
start, and the fencing of 10,000 acres is to
be put through right away. The show is to
be run on a co-operative basis, all the sol-
dier-workers whacking the profits, which are
expected to start arriving in less than 12
months.
From a man who has been on the job:—
I have been working on the two big sugar-mills
which the Queensland Government has had under con-
struction at Babinda and on the Johnson. The prin-
cipal conclusions I formed can be almost compressed
into a statement of the fact that these works, esti-
mated to run into £lBO,OOO, have actually cost twice
as much.
Some materials have cost more than was expected;
but the most depressing part of the whole business is
that the workmen employed have not done half a
fair thing.
The labor position in Queensland is rotten; it is
bad in N. S. Wales, but it is infinitely worse farther
north. And unless somebody can be got to convince
these men that they are going the right way to cut
their own throats, that tragedy is inevitably ahead
of them. Unfortunately it will also mean the wreck
of Queensland.
I don’t complain so much that the minimum wage
of men on such jobs as I had to do with (and,
mind, I hadn’t a penn’orth of interest in it except
as a salaried employee) is 13s. 4d. per day. I
don’t believe the unskilled workman could earn
13s. 4d. a day; I am sure that three out of four
don t try to. It ought to be preached to them that
high wages can only be maintained by high effici-
ency. There'’ is no attempt at high efficiency in
Queensland.
The Government is incomprehensible. Backed by
the Labor members it ought to be educating the
workers. It ought to be teaching them elementary
economic truths. It is doing nothing of the kind,
it is merely truckling to ignorance.
Thirteen-and-fourpence may be a fair minimum
wage in some places. But the State supplies board
at 20s. a week for the unskilled men who are getting
13s. 4d. a day. That shows how unsound the finan-
cial administration is. Both figures can’t be right.
I don t profess to have mastered the intricacies of
the Queensland sugar problem. But I do know that,
in connection with these two mills alone, the indus-
try is being loaded with a hundred-thousand pounds
of wasted money. Either the industry or the tax-
payer will have to pay the wages of every man who
has loafed on these jobs. I expect that the taxpayer
will have to do a lot of the paying. And for this
reason: the State will pay a price for the cane which
it simply can’t afford to pay considering what it will
get for the raw sugar. The loss will have to be
made good out of the public purse.
State enterprise, which ought to be of great value
to the sugar farmers and other primary producers, is
thus being killed by State loafers. Yet 1 don’t
A CASE FOR THE MEDAL.
"I saved her!”
“But who PUSHED YOU IN?”
blame the loafers half as much as those who ought
to be educating the people and showing them the
national disaster which loafing on State works (and
other works, for that matter) means.
• “F. 8.”: Re all these beautiful schemes for
setting up Billjim as orehardist and market-
gardener. During the past few months you
could buy Queensland-grown oranges in
Brisbane at 6d. a dozen; and pineapples
were frequently given away at the Roma-
street markets. Fruitgrowers in the Blackall
Ranges have been letting their fruit rot by
the ton in default of a market. If returned
Billjim had got on to the land prior to the
recent fruit season, what a reward he would
have reaped for his services to the Empire,
etc., etc.! It’s time a stop was put to this
monkeying with Billjim’s future.
“Catkin” from a military hospital in
Blighty
Yesterday’s mail brought me in a Bulletin, the
first for a month, so I didn’t waste any time in
•tearing it open and devouring the political situation
and the quickest way to poison rabbits. In the bed
opposite mine is a new patient, a chaplain, and
when he saw my Bully his eyes opened with a
click. “Pass it across here when you’ve finished, old
chap,” shouted Padre; “I haven’t seen one for weeks.”
So I took it over later and started a yarn. The
sick padre was W. V. Hodson, one of the Bush
Brotherhood from Queensland, who had signed on
there in the ranks, but was hauled out and
handed a commission as padre a week before sailing.
When he got to Blighty he was given a base job
here. But he wanted France, so resigned his com-
mission in the A.I.F. and joined the B.E.F. as
chaplain. When he was due to sail his health gave
way. And he’d only been over here a month. Which
of course goes to prove that while the Queensland
climate is murderous for white men, the mixture of
fog and mud known locally as weather builds up a
man.
Nocturne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bright hills that sink again to purple shade,
Gripped by the groping tendrils of the dusk;
The sudden gleaming of a window-pane
In jewelled amber, and grey evening's fingers
Writing farewell on roof and tree and hill.
And in the west the sun, a shaven Samson
Bound in the tangle of Delilah’s hair,
Dies by the opiate poison of her kiss.
Onward she comes across the shadowed
lands,
Clad in dark mists, black hair ashine with
sta rs,
Clasped in about the cloud-lace at her throat
A finger-nail of gold. And at her feet
Leap into light a thousand silver points
To mark her footprints; while, a moment
leaning
Above the changing opal of a pool,
She laughs to see her beauty mirrored there.
And lo! her laughter, rich and warm as
winds
That blow haphazard on a summer day
O’er Southern Seas, by fairy hands is
fashioned
Into the dreams of children. At her side
There hangs a basket, whence she scatters
Sleep
Across great cities, over silent deserts,
And the wild roar of oceans, flying far
Into the very portals of the day.
QUEENSLAND.
ERNESTINE HEMMINGS.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 26, 1917.
My Dear Tharuoaiindah, —
The week shook itself out of a state of
stagnation on Empire Day and brightened
up before the fires of patriotism. The usual
big concert was held in the Exhibition Hall
in the evening, and, again as usual, several
hundred more citizens than there was room
for tried to squeeze inside and become human
sardines. Patriotic songs and, of course,
speeches spun the programme out to bore-
dom.
The annual dinner to the veterans was
held at midday. Capt. Vernor, of the 88th
Connaught Rangers, a veteran of the Crimea
and the Mutiny, and Mr. Woodman, an old
salt who was fighting in the Baltic in 1854
and around the waspish Chinese forts a few
years later, were the spokesmen of the
party. The ancient mariner mentioned cas-
ually that in the Baltic the British fleet
had no ambulances, doctors or socks. Wonder
what the girls were thinking about!
The Coo-ee Caf6, which is doing splendid
work in raking in money for comforts, is at
the same time providing a ticklish problem.
Its competition has hit the other cafes so
hard that many waitresses have been thrown
out of employment. The Coo-ee is run
entirely by voluntary labor, and the fact
that it is open only for patriotic reasons
brings overflowing patronage to it while the
other eating-houses are more or less empty.
For myself, I’d give the displaced waitresses
a lot more sympathy if I wasn’t so sure that
50 times their number could get excellent
domestic jobs within a week.
Major Buxner, an enthusiastic supporter
of amateur racing in times of peace (where
have I heard that word before?), has been
created a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.
He was wounded in Gallipoli and has since
pursued Abdul with loaded compliments in
Egypt and Syria.
Lt.-Colonel Lachlan Wilson, of the Light
Horse, who has been made proud with the
War Cross of the French, has also a C.M.G.
to his credit. Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine
have been included in his travels. When
out of khaki this energetic soldier is a soli-
citor, a partner in the firm of Tully and
Wilson.
The Rigley family has done its share in
this war. Two sons were in the landing
at Gallipoli, one, Lieut. Jack, of the 9th,
being killed. Now a third son is on his way
to the Front, and a daughter, who has been
on duty for nearly two years at the- Kan-
garoo Point Military Hospital, will shortly
follow him to that address.
Died of wounds in France, Major W. H.
Pickburn, son of Mrs. G. H. Pickburn, for-
merly of South Brisbane and now of
S’Africa. In October, 1916, the Major was
wounded, but refused to go oft' duty, as
there was a shortage of officers. Finally a
leg had to be amputated, but the operation
had been too long delayed.
Maryborough is tipping a modest glass to
one of its old boys who has been pinned to
a Military Cross. He is Lieut. E. Belcher,
who enlisted as a private. Grandfather
Hills fought in the Crimea and China wars,
and wears two medals on State occasions.
Ernest Francis Armit recently marched
out of hospital to Buckingham Palace to
have the Military Cross pinned next the
D.C.M. He won the D.C.M. as a sergeant,
but has got a star since then. All the North
knows the Armits: the head of the family
was one of the pioneer magistrates of the
Gulf and Papua. Lieut. E.F., who has
specialised in machine-gunnery, was a Towns-
ville boy.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Boro-Belle”: Here is evidence of the
growth of the sugar industry in the Mackay
district. Thirty years ago, when Mackay
had nearly 27 tinpot sugar mills and abund-
ance of supposedly-cheap nigger, the Adel-
aide S.S. Co.’s wharf-shed would barely
accommodate 1000 tons. Ten years later a
new wharf and shed capable of storing 5000
tons was erected, and a further addition was
made five years later. To-day, with nine
large factories in place of the old, out-of-date
mills, the co. finds it necessary to erect an
additional big shed and wharf, nearly as
large as the present one, and elevators and
carriers will make it one of the most up-to-
date of its kind in Australia. All, of course,
proof of the blue ruin that was predicted by
the Tories nine years ago in their valedic-
tories to Tommy Tanna.
“Norbell”: Our democratic army! At
the Roma races the other day there, was a
major of the A.I.F. in uniform, with the
D.S.O. ribbon on his breast, taking his modest
place in the town band. He was gallant
Major “Mick” Shanahan, who fought with
the Light Horse at Gallipoli, and after-
wards lost a leg .at Romani. He is Roma’s
pride and idol, and the townspeople have
just presented him with £l5O to help pur-
chase the best artificial limb procurable.
“Marmaduke”: The Clerks’ Union of
Queensland is just about two years old, and
in that short time has secured about half
a dozen awards. The latest is an agreement
with the North Queensland Employers’
Association granting a minimum of £3 10s.
per week at 21 years of age (rising from
15s. at 15 years to 80s. at 23 years), and
equal pay for the sexes. So, as far as the
North is concerned, Billjim’s sister won’t be
cutting rates when Bill reaches for his pen
again.
“Chevron” : An Amiens printer has done
some French war postcards into English for
us. One pictures a traction-engine and a
train of A.S.C. waggons stranded in the mud
of a desolate and shell-shattered road. Above
is the description, in French: —
La Grande Guerre Europienne: Une locomotive
abandonnee decant' Thiepval.
The printer man has got an Anglo-French
dictionary, and translated word by word as
follows: —
One locomotive a profligate woman forepart
Thiepval.

Don’t Have Grey Hair.
A simple, old-fashioned, home-made recipe will
make the greyness disappear.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
(hey are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless
manner. You have only to get two ounces
of tammalite concentrate from your chemist
and mix it with three ounces of bay rum to
prove this. Apply this simple and harmless
lotion for a few nights to the hair with a
small sponge and the greyness will gradually
disappear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy, and has been proved over and over
again for generations past by those in posses-
sion of the formula. —Advt.

The “Plum” Razor
Evan Jones, who died at Mosman
(X.S.W.), the other day, was the 71 years-
old pa of Sydney City Council, of which he
had been a member since ’B2. with only one
bleak. He came to Sydney from England as
a child, and served his time as a jeweller's
apprentice, sticking faithfully to the trade
all his life. He helped the late George
lJibbs to represent Australia at the Chicago
World s Fair in 1893. when Oeorsre d—d the
city.
Killed in action on Good Friday. Phil
V ilkins, aged 24. Wilkins was an A.M.C.
stretcher-bearer in the fire-zone at the Galli-
poli landing, and went through six smoky
months in the Peninsula till enteric caught
him and sent him back to Sydney. Dis-
charged as fit, he got a transfer to the in-
fantry. and had been wearing a sergeant's
stripes for six months in France. Two
brothers are lieutenants in the A.I.F, at the
Front
"Marino”: After an experience of 20
years or so with the Queensland tick, experts
have failed to discover quite a lot about its
habits. Theorists reckon that the pathogenic
or fever-bearing insect in some unknown
way clambers across the border and infests
the contiguous herds in N. S. Wales. Lately
inspectors have been closely watching 15 or
10 farms in order to squelch the redwater
scourge as soon as it appears, but a few
weeks ago all calculations were completely
upset by a serious form of redwater attack-
ing a totally unexpected herd. This farm is
-1 miles from the border, and is separated
by 11 clean herd and steep T scrub ridges. Six
head of milkers took the count before any-
one was prepared to admit the identity of
the complaint. .Vow. new theories are being
promulgated as to the mode of transmission
of the enemy. Birds are freely blamed.
From Willie over the water:—
I think there i« nothing in England these trying
times quite so despicable as the man in the four-
cornered hat feathered with chicken Huff. He is an
unsleeping and indomitable butter-in. He is appar-
ently a mayor of sorts; he is as frequent as flies,
and is an ass of unparalleled magnitude. He wears,
in addition to the aforesaid detested hat, a metal
chain formidable enough to hold 10 bullocks to a
Oft. gum-butt, and an atrocious official over-all
being 1 too long for him, he gathers up in front
and carries bunched, accenting his other grand-
motherly attributes in a most distressing way. Great
masses of woeful soldiers, wearied from long march-
ing and harried by trench practice, are continually
being drawn up in haggard lines, and kept stiff,
fagged, bored and perishing, drearily waiting white
this banal feature of a damp and befogged landscape
trots his matronly- accoutrements and dead face up
one line and down the other to no end discoverable
to angels or men. Soldiers back from the Front,
more or less damaged, sick of formalities, eager for
nothing but u square feed or to creep into the dark-
ness and softness of God-blessed bed, and be still for
180 years, are jambed into blocks again, and com-
pelled to burden their already intolerably-misused
feet for another hour or so, while this same garish
individual haunts them like a feathered nightmare.
I have heard him cursed with the deadliest venom
and the burning bate of white fire, unanimously and
simultaneously, by 2000 rascally soldiers, but;
nothing stops him. In the rough earnestness of war the
dial), dusty worry of getting real things done, in the
tremendous reality now upon us, this jigging autom-
aton in his old aunt’s garments, and his tinsel neck-
lace, arid his lid garnished with down is a hideously
comic travesty, a mockery, a pantomime dame. But,
blesses! he is an English institution! When the
Last Trump sounds he will inevitably amble out in
his chain, his tiat and his long gilded maternity
gown, and proceed to review the hosts.
ex ~M-H.R., had three sons
at the front; now he has only two, one hav-
ing lost his life in the West recently. There
is a fourth son. aged 15, who is waiting his
chance to sneak through.
“Murkah”: One of the results of the
enhanced value of the old windjammer has
been the installation of wireless. About 2]

The progressive Yank leads with 16. Great
Britain is next with three, and Belgium and
Japan have one each. First time the train-
ing sailer Mersey attempted to use the gear
all hands called” till an epidemic of tele-
graphist s cramp threatened, and no answers
were received. Finally, we saw a steamer
coming up that had wireless aerials.
We flagged: “Stand by, we wish to
communicate by wireless.” The steamer’s
astonished skipper informed his operator
to _do his hardest. But though a
variety of notes, from the piccolo of
the German singing spark to the big bass
drum ot I oidhu high-power, nothing was re-
turned from the Mersey. Her signals at that
distance should have been strong enough to
rattle the steamer’s funnel. After that, the
Mersey s skipper gave orders to keen
the signal halyards well oiled. The trouble
proved to be a cigarette-tin. It had slipped
behind a switchboard and earthed the aerial.
“Haka”: At Dunedin (MX.) the other
day one candidate butted in with this:—
Vote for -, councillor and ex-mayor of Law-
rence, road contractor, valuator, auctioneer, banker
gardener, quarryman, laborer, Burnside tinm-keeper
and general merchant Have sent three sons to the
I-ront and did my bit in the .Maori War. Enlisted
and was turned down during the present trouble If
I miss I won’t whip che cat. ' .
He missed all right, but I and 4625 others
gave the unlucky old sport a vote.
The whirligig of time. The first Labor

Arthur Griffith (Public Works, now fallen

and now a member of the National Min-
istry) ; .J. L. Trefle (Agriculture, gone the
way of all flesh) ; A. Edden ( Mines,
bundled out of the party, and now a full-

STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
\fter much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. W t
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues bv liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Rilev Streets, Sydney.
Try This Corn Cure.
Yon will never know how easy it is to
get rid of corns until you have tried
Handy Corn Cure. Nothing like it has
ever been produced.
Oh! My! Corn-pains in every nerve!
It will-dumbfound you, especially if
you have tried everything else for corns —
applied in two seconds, and if it does
not cure your corns we wili refund your
money.
If you have ever made a fat bundle of
vour toes with bandages; used thick,
corn pressing rings ; corn pulling salves
or liquid medicines that took off more
toe than corn—well, you will appreciate
Handy Corn Cure. Try Handy Corn
Cure for any corn, callous, wart or
bunion. It never fails.
Sold by retailers at Is. per box; 3
boxes for 2s. 6d. Posted to any address

At Jennie’s first attack of croup I was absolutely terrified
for a few moments. I cannot tell you how it grieved me to listen to the choking cough
and watch her gasping for breath, but I quickly found that there is no need f° r alarm
when one uses Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. You know with croup a false membrane
forms in the throat; until this is removed the choking continues.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
loosens this membrane and causes the child
to expel it by vomiting.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is a safe
and certain remedy for croup and if given
as soon as the child becomes hoarse, or
even after the croupy cough appears, it
will prevent the attack.
When I think of the many times this
medicine has saved me the unnecessary
expense of a doctor’s bill I don t wonder that
it is used in so many thousands of homes.

DID YOU KNOW
That the manufacturers of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which is the
largest selling and most successful medicine of its kind in the world, also
make CHAMBERLAIN’S TABLETS for the Stomach and Liver? Chamberlain’s
Tablets are a new and improved remedy for Biliousness and Disorders of the Stomach, Liver and Bowels ; they have met
with the greatest success in the treatment of Constipation, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Impaired Digestion and Liver
Disorders. Chamberlain’s Tablets not only move the bowels but improve the appetite and correct disorders of the stomach
and liver. Where Chamberlain’s Tablets have been used they are a most popular medicine and everyone who has used them
is pleased with the prompt relief they afford. THEY ARE BETTER THAN PILLS and you would never wish to take another
dose of pills after having used Chamberlain’s Tablets ; they are easier and more pleasant to take, more mild and gentle in
their action and more reliable, as they can always be depended upon. Chamberlain s lablets cleanse and invigorate the
stomach and leave the bowels in a natural condition, while pills are more harsh in effect and their use is often followed
by constipation. They are sold by all chemists and storekeepers throughout the Commonwealth at Is. 6d. per box.
THE thing that the people should have
been allowed to realise from the outset
is that WE MAY GET A LICKING. We
still may get a licking. Are you

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

haven’t a line in your face, and your cheeks
are quite peach-like. Do tell me how

merely indulge in a sparkling face bath two

'JHE BLOOD is the energiser of the system. Upon its quality
depends the nourishment of every organ, every nerve-centre,
every muscle of the body.
Poorness of Blood is called Antemia —girls, women and men
are all subject to it. ,
It manifests itself in breathlessness on slight exertion, pale
cheeks, lustreless eyes, depression and exhaustion.
If you have any of these symptoms, or are run-down and need
a tonic, take Iron ‘Jelloids’ to enrich the blood.
When the blood has been enriched and strengthened, Anaemia
is overcome —the symptoms give place to abundant vitality, rosy
cheeks, and a feeling of general “fitness” and well-being.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote :—“ Impoverished blood can be made rich and good
“ by means of Iron 'Jelloids,' the most effective and desirable treatment."

“Kia Ora” : Thirty years ago, when Wil-
liam Pember Reeves, afterwards Agent-
General for Maoriland, used to mark the
reporters’ assignment-book in the office of
the Lyttelton Times at Christchurch, one
man’s duties for the day were always fixed
in a spirit of gentle levity. If Reeves
wanted him to do a bun-struggle or inter-
view the Premier or something, he appended
opposite the fixture the initials “G.0.M.”
That was to distinguish the chief reporter,
James Plunkett, whom Reeves spoke of in
those far-away days as the Grand Old Man,
for he was the proprietor of patriarchal
whiskers and a head long gone bald. That
old man lasted till the other day. He was
87, and in one capacity and another had
been ever since at the dreary business that
Reeves as a young man found him in. So if
there is any ambitious youth who wants to
live till 87 he might try being a reporter in
M.L., and if he has not succumbed to infan-
tile paralysis before he is 30 his chance of
making good up near the century will be
about a million to one.
‘‘Copy Boy” : The death in Melbourne of
actress Carry George recalls a unique
theatrical performance of the ’GO’s in which
she took part. Some of the press gang who
wrote caustic words anent the plays and
players of the period were sarcastically in-
vited by the profesh to show how the thing
should be done. The result was a perform-
ance of “London Assurance,” given by Mel-
bourne pressmen, at the old Royal Princess’s,
in aid of the Brooke memorial fund. A pro-
fessional backing was provided by Carry
George and Mrs. G, B. W. Lewis as Grace
Harkaway and Lady Gay Spanker respec-
tively. The inky mummers included James
Smith (Simpson), who for many years
wrote dramatic criticism and literary notes
for the Age, ■ and in his spare time con-
tributed to London Punch and plunged
neek-deep into spiritualism; George Walstab
(“Dazzle”), the brilliant freelance and Mel-
bourne Herald man; Britton (Martin), who
was then on the Argus and later became
associate-editor of the S. M. HERAim; and
ARGUS-editor Howard Willoughby, who
played Solomon Isaacs. Not generally
known that Carry George was for a time
with Lola Montez. A stock eo, of which she
was a member contained Frank Thornton,
Charles Holloway, Alice Deorwyn and Theo-
dore Kremer, who rose to affluence as author
of “The Fatal Wedding,” “The King of
the Bigamists,” and other stage classics.
THE FEAST APART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I don’t want to write
Or to think overmuch,
For such wonderful light
And such splendor in sight
Put the mind out, of touch,
Set the soul far away
From the needs of the day.
Just to loiter is sweet,
Just to lie in the sun
With the waves at my feet,
Running in, white and fleet—
Journeys over and done.
Filling down, tired and spent,
With a crown of content.
White gulls wheel about,
Skim the waves leisurely,
And the slow combers spout
Where five headlands stand out
* Lion-like in the sea —
Pitting shoulders of rock
To the waves’ ceaseless shock.
Five headlands !... .and lo —
Cosied close to their- sides —
Five beaches of snow
Where the waves come and go,
And the winds and the tides
Phy a while, night and day,
And then saunter away.
I don’t want to think
Of the fret of the world,
But to watch the sun sink,
And the clouds turn to pink,
And a boat, sails unfurled,
Head to sea with the wind
Softly pushing behind.
Though X know that the needs
Of the world are supreme,
That the dreamer who heeds
Not their calling, nor speeds
From the realm of his dream,
Goes hungry in time—
Yet to dream is sublime!
Yea, to dream with the east
Perplexed o’er by the west,
Ami be bidden to feast
(Not the last nor the least),
But a glorified guest
At a fair festival
In Beauty’s high hall.
There a table is spread
With rich viands and fine
(Beauty throned,at its head),
Though it lack wheaten bread,
Fruit, red meat and wine,
’Tis more than king's fare
That one finds tabled there.
Not I, but my soul
Is the guest at that board
While the glory-clouds roll,
And it drinks from a bowl
Wherein Beauty has poured
A delectable draught
Such as monarch ne’er quaffed.
And its bread is more sweet
Than a miller e'er milled
From the finest of wheat,
And it eats of a meat
That no huntsman has killed,
And its couch is a cloud
Where the rose-splendors crowd.
I don’t want to think
Or to write overmuch,
For a cloud turns to pink
Whore the skies bend to drink,
And my mind’s out of touch
With the world, leagues away,
And the needs of the day!

Returned from the Firing Line
He Praises
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
Private Harley Cohen, No. 37,
A Company, 4th Batt., A.1.F., was
one of the first Australians to en-
list. He was in the famous land-
ing at Gallipoli, and went right
through the campaign until
wounded early in the Lone Pine
charge. To while away anxious
hours in the fighting line he
wrote some verses: “They Were
There, There, There!’’ On his re-
turn to Australia these words were
set to music by Mr. Bert Rache,
and the song has been played by
over thirty bands and sung by
many well-known people, including
Mr. Peter Dawson, who has secured
the Gramophone rights. Mr.
Cohen wrote to us on his return :
I would like to say that Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery has
been better to me even than my
luck. I escaped the severe
colds some of my comrades had
because of my habit of taking a
sip of New Discovery every
day. It seems to have made
my throat and lungs cold resist-
ant. I am glad to be able to
add my testimony to the many
pals who have found New Dis-
covery their Mascot.

A Romance of Empty Bottles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rT was a yellow night. The moon at
flood
Poured a full radiance over meadow
lands,
Where drowsy cattle mumbled still the cud
Of waking dreams; and <>n the river sands
Slow waters made a murmurous rippling
sound,
And turned an empty bottle round and
round.
That bottle, outcast in the glowing night.
Had held a mellow fantasy of joy
Whose dimpled bubbles curving into ligijt
Were each for some young hope a mooring-
buoy. . , ,
All empty now the wine s lost overcoat
I, too, whs empty..but I did not float.
As some lost star that: takes her dreary way
Through the dark streets where bursting
bombs explode,
Fur whom no lighted theatre is gay,
Forgets her lines, her jewels and the mode,
Hid goes abroad as any cabbage might.
So I beneath the moon that yellow night.
Hungry I was, and lost, and other things.
The mocking moon roused anger in my
breast.
.My silken ankles with mosquito stings
Burned where the seeded grass against them
prest.
So scared I was in those neglected ways
1 felt my cold heart bump my tight-laced'
stays.
Of course, I was not going anywhere,
And no more lost than any time last week,
When streets and houses hid the pale despair
That made me paint a rose on either cheek;
But midnight cows and bottles doomed to
float
Filled me with terror to my girlish throat.
No special sin was mine save lack of cash.
1 could not beg, to dig I was ashamed ;
And so, with confidence a little rash,
I sought this horrid wild, remote, untamed.
Deeming adventure better far than sloth,
Though dinner I had much preferred to both.
My maiden blushes mantling nose and brow
Were wasted on this yellow, desert air.
Some manly hand perchance these fields
might plough.
r could not find the fellow anywhere.
.Manless was day and boyless all the night,
A world of vast and trouserless affright.
And then he came. I saw him slowly stride,
Moon-circled, splendid, under bending trees.
His beard was spade-shaped and his chest
was wide,
Though by his walk lie seemed but ill at ease.
“Excuse me.” he remarked in manner tame
With much politeness, “do you know my
name?”
I did not, and I had to tell him so.
lle said he lost it somewhere on the track;
And who or what he was he did not know
Till memory or someone brought it back.
There was a softness in his mouth and eyes
That made me keen to soothe and sympa-
thise.
What’s in a name? I hinted Shakspeare’s
scorn.
Names are the handles of the casket Man.
Without them every child of Eve is born ;
They have but plagued us since the world
began;
For-never yet was Jane' so poor and mean
But that she longed to be Evangeline.
Being without a sound to answer to.
I called him, for convenience, simply Fred.
His eyes were of the darkest shade of blue :
His hair beneath the moonlight clustered red.
We sat upon a log to count the cost
In squandered moonlight of thus being lost.
Fred’s pleasant arm about my maiden waist
Gave me a sense of exquisite support.
Love tripped along the bush in happy haste,
His arrows tingling for the merry sport;
And for a while we did not seem to care
If we were anything or anywhere.
The bush is wide. That was a month ago.
F am engaged to Fred if lie can find
A name or job or place or any show
The union of two happy hearts to bind ;
But just at present dinner is our quest,
And hunting that.affords us little rest.
Along the land from dawn till dark we speed,
All night we softly steal from tree to tree;
And once a week or so we snare a feed
To save romance from growing spirit free.
But questions built on what or when or
how
Are like the wind that makes an empty row.
Trees, and more trees, and now and then a
stream,
A belt of scrub, a hillside brown and bare —
The leisure we might share for love and
dream
Hears the wild neighings of night's hungri-
est mare.
If we were somewhere, something might be
done —•
.Oh, Cupid, for plain butter on a bun !
I wrote my name upon a rock last week,
Lest on some pallid morning wild and wet
My memory through my battered soul should
leak
Leaving me nameless with a long regret.
And now that rock itself I have mislaid —
I feel the syllables begin to fade.
The sun gets up at morn and sets at eve ;
The moon alternately is thick and thin.
My creed growls narrow ; I can scarce believe
That there is any world to turn and spin.
Always I see as in a pointless dream
Two empty bottles in a useless stream.
Yet hope has chased us without pause or
rest —
Kind hope the liar of uncounted days—
Fred says he feels him in his manly breast;
I know he has a place beneath my stays....
We must get somewhere. I am sure we
will,
Tn spite of all we have two tramfares stffl-

MARY McCOMMONWEALTH
My Crowded Month.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAD always been an adventure-lover, in
theory; but for years circumstances
combined to debar me from playing the
spirited part in life that I would have liked.
I fell back regretfully on fiction. I delighted
to read of the wireless-operator who sent out
S.O.S. calls so long as his ship remained
•afloat, and of the men who entered burning
and gas-polluted coal-mines in order to
rescue their mates. How I wished that the
chance to perform some such feat would come
my way When the war began I was among
the first to volunteer. However, the doctors
discovered a multitude of defects, ranging
from a hammer toe tb weak lungs, and I
returned to hero-worship-—my idols now
being chiefly flying-men 1 and submarine
commanders —and almost ceased to hope for
personal fame.
And then I met Ralph Cazenove.
I was crossing from Sydney to Mil son's
Point late one afternoon. Near me sat a
tall, gaunt man who wrote feverishly in a
notebook. His hat was pushed back from
one of those lofty and bulging brows which
are to be found in men of genius sometimes;
.in imbeciles often; in normal human beings
never. To my astonishment he sidled up to
me, as the steamer slowed down, pushed
.several pieces of paper into my hand, and
whispered: "1 am being watched. Destroy
these unread. It is a matter of State.” “But
who? Where!” I asked excitedly. “The
fat man with the handbag and the plants,
and the smaller one with the blue muffler.
Don't speak to me again.” I edged to the
side, and dropped the compromising docu-
ments overboard, then fell back to try to
learn what manner of men these were who
dared to embarrass the State at such a crisis
in its history.
“I say he put him out with an uppercut,”
the smaller scoundrel was saying, in the flat,
weary tone of one who states an oft-told
truism —“a right uppercut.”
“It w 7 as a hook,” said the other. “A
bee-u-tiful left - hook. Like one of
McGoorty’s. I never saw anything plainer.”
“It only shows me what I’ve said before,”
droned the wearer of the muffler; “namely,
your ignorance of the whole damn game.”
And the voices faded bitterly into the crowd.
What ! The very jargon of the
ring! Who that did not know would sus-
pect them of plotting against their country?
The incident sent me home in quite a pleas-
antly-excited frame of mind.
I saw my tall friend four or five evenings
later. We were again on the North Shore
boat. To my gratification he remembered
me.
“A close call that, the other afternoon,” he
remarked. “I have to thank you for your
help. I was up against a couple who stick
at little.”
“They were disclosing prizefighting,” I
said.
He laughed. “A blind, needless to say.
One was Hemings, otherwise known as ‘The
Jaguar’; the shorter man was the notorious
Hermann Schwartz.”
“You astonish me,”. I -said. “I thought
they were Britishers. Their voices, their
manner”
“Yes,” smiled my companion, “acting is
part of their accursed trade. However, we
hope, within a day or so, to have them
safely under lock and key.” As the steamer
reached the wharf he said: “We separate
here, I fancy. I have a little job on up the
line. But if you would care to see me to-
morrow I shall be in the Australia about
five. Here is my card,”
On it was inscribed,
Ralph Cazenove,
National Investigator.
I was thrilled, overjoyed. I began to feel
that my life’s dream might yet come true.
Cazenove arrived next day at the appointed
hour. He glanced keenly around the Winter
Garden, and then led me to the curtained
doorway near the barber’s-shop. “Would
you care,” he asked, in a searching manner,
“to help me in rather a delicate matter?”
I said, truthfully, that nothing would please
me more.
“Do you see a carefully-dressed man sit-
ting with a lady, and one who might be an
actor ?” I nodded. “I want you, during the
next 20 minutes, to make a careful note of
that man’s every movement.” And he was
gone.
I was stupefied. The presumably danger-
ous character on whom I had to spy was
Reggie Hartopp, M.P. —one who had made
a political business of Imperialism for years,
and who, in his spare moments, was his
native city’s most glittering man-about-town.
However, it was not mine to question, but
to obey. Hartopp’s companions were Miss
Palliser, tbe newly-arrived tragedy star, and
her husband. I observed that during the
period specified bv the Investigator the
M.P. was nodded to by 19 people and
addressed by eight. I noted down the names
of those of his friends whom I knew by
siglit. The suspect drank two cups of tea.
ate four cakes, and just as Cazenove re-
appeared, lit an immense cigar. “I suppose
you know who he is,” I said, as I handed
over the results of my labors. “No-o,” re-
plied Cazenove. He seemed a shade embar-
rassed when I told him. “Anyhow.” he said,
with a touch of annoyance, “my duty is to
follow instructions regardless of class or
any other eons'derations. Queer things are
happening in all quarters these days.”
We did a lot of watching and note-taking
in the next couple of weeks. The notes
went to Headquarters. Cazenove was at
Headquarters from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.
every day but Saturday, a fact which I
regretted." as I would have liked to see more
of him. He talked often of getting me a job
on the Staff, but it never materialised. And
then came our Great Adventure.

EVERY-DAY
ACCIDENTS
Sores and Festering Cuts
Promptly Healed by Zam-Buk.
MR. EDWARD SULLIVAN,
47 Victoria Avenue, Albert
Park, Melbourne, writes:—'
“I am constantly getting
my hands torn and cut with nails
and hoop-iron at my daily work.
However, as soon as I get home
at night I just rub a little Zam-
Buk on the injured places, and
they are soon healod.
“On -one occasion my hand
got poisoned and became very
swollen. Festering set in,
and the injury was dreadfully
painful. It was a matter of the
greatest difliculty to do any work,
but Zain-Buk gave rapid relief.
Not only did it allay the irritation.

but Zam-Buk also took away the festering and then perfectly healed my
hand.
“I suffered greatly from a poisoned face, the cause of which I do not
really know. My face swelled enormously, and was much inflamed and
extremely painful. Zam-Buk was most cooling, reduced the inflamma-
tion and drew out the poison and healed my complaint very quickly.
“When working at case-making I came in contact with a nail which
inflicted a nasty gash on the abdomen. The place was most awkward
and painful, but Zam-Buk also healed this in the same rapid manner.”

Managing Agent i RALPH ABERCROMBY,
Denison House,
380-2 Geora'e Street. SYDNEY.
Cazenove had foreshadowed it for some
time. Briefly, the plot was this. There was
interned at the Brentford Concentration
Camp a German doctor who had valuable
liiformat-on to sell, the cash to be paid to his
destitute wife. But he feared the other Ger-
mans too much to b' interviewed by day,
and the camp Commandant refused, in face
of the strongest ofii. wl pressure, to coun-
tenance a m- eting by night. Cazenove pro-
posed to seee the German clandestinely.
The risk, lie explained, "is, of course,
terrific. I shall have to overpower the
guard, and do it, moreover, in absolute
silence. If I fail, the Department will dis-
own me. I shall be a ruined man. If, on
the other hand, I succeed—well, it may lead
to anything.”
A Saturday night was chosen for the
attempt. We caught the 4.20 to Puddlebv,
dined at the unspeakable Station Hotel, and
settled down to wait. At nine we began the
six-mile drive to Brentford; and a few
minutes later the storm, which had been
threatening all day, broke and exploded over
our heads. It was as though the elements
had gone mad. The lightning was the bright-
est, tlie thunder the loudest, the rain the
most drenching that I have known. When
we dismissed our conveyance a mile from
the camp my leader had to howl to make his
instructions understood. He was to go
ahead, disarm the sentry, and meet the Ger-
man at an appointed spot. My business was
to wait half a mile from the camp and inter-
cept anyone, coming from Puddleby.’ "You
aie to let no one pass, ’ roared the Investiga-
tor. l ake this, ’ handing me an ancient-
looking revolver; “and if you have to shoot,
shoot to kill.” I pointed out that there were
no cartridges in it, at which he was con-
fused. “-Curse the carelessness of those Head-
quarters’ orderlies,” he said, and thrust the
weapon back in his dripping pocket. He
finally produced a piece of fencing - , and told
mo to rely on that.
“And now,” he said, “I must go. My
appointment with Kessler is for 30
minutes lienee, and”—grimly—“there is much
to do in the time.”
A last earnest hand-grip, and he was off
on his perilous mission. Half an hour
passed, an hour, two hours. I was now more
than anxious. Plainly my unfortunate col-
league had failed. I decided that it was my
duty to look for him. The rain had stopped
an hour or more before. The moon was
Showing fitfully through the driving clouds.
It was easy to trace where poor Cozenove
had ploughed through the clay at the road-
side. I had followed the tracks for. per-
haps, 400 yards, when a paralysing phenome-
non occurred. They turned into the huvli.
les, instead of proceeding some quarter of
a mile further along the road to where the
sentry, and the only possible entrance to the
camp awaited him, my ooor friend had wan-
dered off at right angles. I tracked him for
oU yards, or more, through the trees, to the
overhanging rock, beneath whose shelter he
had sat down to smoke—as evidenced by a
litter of cigarette-butts. His footsteps, on
(‘merging, went first in a westerly direction,
then south, then east, then uncertainly south
again, and were lost in the undergrowth. I
shouted myself hoarse. In vain. There was
no more to be done. Sick at heart, I started
back to the city.
* * * *
The police could make nothing of the
matter. They found no trace whatever of
my late colleague, and ended by questioning
his very existence. Day after day I searched
tor him. I haunted his chief resorts. I
almost lived on the Milson’s Point wharf
between the hours of five to six p.m. Inci-
dentally, I saw Schwartz and The Jaguar
every evening, mostly arguing savagely on
the old topic, and carrying bundles of plants
encased in bagging, and parcels of what
seemed to bo food. Only now did I realise
Jiow little I really knew of poor Cazenove.
1 had no idea where Headquarters lay, or
what the name of his Chief was, or where lie
lived, or whether lie was married or a
bachelor—in fact, I was ignorant of every
essential detail in connection with him.
I had been visiting an aunt at Roseville,
one Sunday, at a time when I had, in my
heart, given up all hope of seeing the Inves-
tigator again. I was thinking how often I
had seen my friend off, on this very line, in
pursuit of one of those “little jobs” which
he insisted on tackling single-handed. Sud-
denly I observed, bending over a spade, in
a small roadside garden, a well-known back.
Hi another second I was wringing Rupert
Cazenove’s hand. Pie did not appear glad to
see me. “James, ’J came in a strident
woman’s voice from the cottage to which the
garden was attached. “Tee-ee!” Cazenove
grew crimson. “Well, pood-bye, old chap,”
lie muttered uneasily. “See you later
Good-bye.”
A hard-faced female appeared. “Are you
coming in to tea?” she inquired, then seeing
me: ‘lf you have a friend, bring him in,”
and she proceeded to wait for us. My old
colleague presented her to me, in a dis-
tracted manner, as his wife. However, on
ni.v addressing her as “Mrs. Cazenove”’she
said tartly, “Snigsford’s the name, please.
Mrs. Snigsford is quite good enough for me.”
I began to see light. The Investigator
had his human side, then. But why? Why?
Mill. I reflected, tastes in womankind differ
wonderfully. I smiled, and took quiet stock
of (his little abode of illicit love.
“The last time your—er—husband and I
were together the circumstances were rather
different, Mrs. Cazc—that is, Snigsford,” I
said.
“Indeed !” she replied acidly, “and where
might that have been?”
“At Brentford, in one of the worst storms
I have known.”
It was as if I had exploded a bomb in the
room.
So you've the one that’s been encourag-
ing Mr. Snigsford in his tom-foolery?” she
snapped.
•T understood his name was Cazenove,” I
said feebly.
“Snigsford's his name. I tell you: John
Albert Snigsford, of Pofflc and Co.”
“But what about his investigation work?”
She made a gesture expressive of repudia-
tion, contempt and other things.
“He’s never investigated anything in his
life. He neither has the time, the brains
i:or tlie pluck. What you thought you were
doing humbugging round that German Camp
in the middle of the night I don’t know, but
this I nan tell you ; my unfortunate husband
came home half-dead next evening, and what
With pneumonia and complications I’ve had
him on my hands ever since. And now,”
with Arctic civility, “if you’ve quite finished
your tea I’ll say good-bye.”
I looked round for my broken idol. He
had vanished. I left. There was really
nothing else to do.
J.B.D.
At Fraser’s Ford.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOME vows are graven on the rooks,
And some are writ on sands;
And some men kill with poison-words,
And some with clutching hands!
Dick Halkett heard the liar’s tale,
And heard it to the end ;
And in his heart he scorned his wife,
And more than scorned his friend.
Upon him sullen, drear and dread,
Dropped down tire leaden skies;
Although there was no mist at all
A red mist dimmed his eyes.
He mounted, wheeled and homeward rode,
Hot fever in his brain ;
His face upturned as if to catch
The cold, swift, slanting rain.
The like of such a dreadful rain
Pray God we seldom see —
Six drenching days, six drenching nights,
It fell unceasingly.
From crow of cock to hoot of owl
A sullen sheet it poured;
The dams were full, the creeks were gorged,
The rivers raged and roared.
With fetlocks sunk and steaming sides
He crouched upon her back—
His gallant mare strong-shouldered forged
Her way along the track.
Torn leaves a whirling tumult made,
The winds like lions roared ;
But hearing nought and fearing nought,
He rode towards Fraser’s Ford.
The rain-scourge like a thousand whips
His eyes and forehead flayed ;
Because he had a man to kill
He neither stopped nor stayed.
Within him surged , that utter rage
Red vengeance only calms;
And thrice he drove his finger-nails
Into his calloused palms.
And thrice, and more than thrice, he saw
His wife in all her charms—
Her eyes, her hair, her wondrous hair,
Her rounded throat and arms.
And thrice he saw his faithless friend,
The viper he had nursed.
And thrice he felt his stung-heart bleed,
And thrice he groaned and cursed.
And thrice he saw them, friend and wife,
Set close with linking hands;
Some vows are graven on the rocks,
And some upon the sands!
Rain streaked his face, his hair grew wet,
With hate his dark eyes gloomed ;
Ere yet he came to Fraser’s Ford
It seemed low thunder boomed.
Low thunder, such as never rolled
From lightning-riven cloud,
It .grew and grew and shook the air,
More loud and yet more loud.
But spur at work and whip in hand
He did not seek its cause;
Because he had a man to kill
He did not stay nor pause.
And still the thunder grew and grew,
And filled the hills and roared —
I lied waters foaming as they charged
Man-high o’er Fraser’s Ford !
And Halkett saw and clenched his fist,
And shook it in the murk :
What devil’s hand had set this thing
Betwixt him and his work?
The waters leapt like famished wolves,
lne leaden rain down-poured;
Although lie had a man to kill
He feared to cross the Ford.
He saw, tossed like so many straws,
Ironged snags and roots descend;
And then, upon the farther side,
He saw his wife and friend.
Hard hate came hot-foot to his aid
Red anger fired his blood;
Because he had a man to kill
He rode into the flood.
The waters tore him from his horse.
Rolled, bruised, and thrust him down;
He heard that chiming of sweet bells
I hat men hear when they drown.
And then, he glimpsed above the flood
The river fierce and grim—
His wife with anguished face out-thrust
And white arms stretched to him.
And then, with life grown grey and faint,
And hate and love at end.
He felt sure help about him thrown—-
The strong arm of his friend !
And. inch by inch, that strong arm won,
Though fierce and grim the task :
llis friend had risked his life for him—
What more could Friendship ask?
And, day and night, with tender care,
And kiss, and soothe-of-hand,
His wife gave all her heart to him—
What more could love demand?
Since which says Halkett, serious-browed,
When cynic wisdom mocks :
“Some vows are written on the sands,
But more upon the rocks!”
