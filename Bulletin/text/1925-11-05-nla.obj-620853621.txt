A Lesson in Clay
The potter’s art has been declared to be
the key of civilisation. It is so at least
to the extent of enabling the archaiologist
to determine with a good deal of accuracy
the human status of ancient tribes and
nations whose memorials remain in the rub-
bish heaps of tlie ages; and in historical
times the ceramic test can be applied to most
of tlie more important nations with similar
results. In almost every case tlie people wlio
are doing big things in other directions are
doing big tilings with clay. On such a test
Australia looks poor. Apart from a little
experimental pottery, which is not lacking in
beauty, some larger articles, like bathroom
fittings, which are of tlie highest class, and
a little cheap ware for domestic use, we have
hardly yet exploited this the very first of
our national possibilities. We import from
many lands; and 99 per cent, of tlie broken
fragments of our rubbish-tips consist of!
foreign clay. Unless it has been made in
secret, or for experiment only, no piece of
porcelain or bone china has yet been made
from Australian materials ; though the mat-
erials are to be found in quantity and the
things of beauty to be formed from them
should be more tempting to those wlio wish
to develop applied arts than almost any-
thing else to which we could turn our hands..
Taste in cliina is tlie most domestic of
all tastes. It is a thing belonging to the
little round of every day; and its subtle
influence in the making of the Australian
mind must be very great. Yet we leave this
influence entirely - to outsiders, to Stafford-
shire and London, to France and Bohemia,
even to China and Japan. That our taste,
to win a place, must compete against all
these may be true; >but when Australians
really get down to the test in such matters
they seldom fail. That we should only
compete in the cheapest lines, and in those
where mechanical skill without taste is the
thing demanded, is hardly to our credit.
The history of the old English factory of
Ixiwestoft has a curious interest for a coun-
try like our own, where the game seems ready
to our hands and we hesitate to play it.
Lowestoft in 1756 was almost as far re-
moved from the world’s pottery centres as
Australia is to-day. Primary production had
been its sole idea through all the centuries;
and though Worcester, Derby, Chelsea and
Bow had already issued tlieir challenge to
the European factories and to all the Orient,
and were turning out wares which are still
a source of national pride, Lowestoft looked
about the last place in England to join that
high effort in industrial art. But a local
squire got an idea. He believed something
could be made from the clay on bis land, and
attempted to put bis faith to the test. Tlie
first experiments looked good ; and he brought
expert workmen from London to carry on.
The London factories took alarm, and bribed
men to spoil tlie work; and the squire wrote
failure across bis plan, and let it go at that.
But in Ixiwestoft there were people of stur-
dier make. A company was formed to try
again; the directors included a chemist, a
bricklayer and a fisherman. One of them
went to London and got a job in the Bow
works, then called “New Canton.” There
he watched for opportunities; and at last,
by hiding in a barrel, learned the things
he wanted to know, and saw the mixing of
the clay. Within a few months Lowestoft
had a factory in full operation, and its china
—generally rather Crudely decorated, but the
genuine article-—was making all its big rivals
sit up. It went even farther; for its cheap
wares disturbed the markets of Europe.
If the story ended there, or the effort
had been continuous to the present day, as
in the case of Worcester, it would stand as
one of the fine examples of English grit;
and Australians might be urged to look upon
the picture as a model for local enterprise.
That up to about 1785 or 1790 it was such
a model is certain; but unfortunately the
end of the tale has an Australian applica-
tion also. The Lowestoft company had
acquired shipping interests and was trading
with the Dutch, who in turn were trading
with China and Japan. The little factory
found that its orders were exceeding its
ability to fill them and turned to importing
as a remedy. Chinese porcelain wares reached
Lowestoft, and after having a few daubs of
paint added were re-fired and sent out as the
products of the factory. The market was
flooded; the price fell; the works closed
tlieir doors in something like disgrace in
1802. Certainly all the original shareholders
who survived retired from the business as
rich men; but East Anglia lias made no
chi,na .since.
Australia’s great resources may be mut-
ton and wool and grain ; but clay might get
a little more consideration. Even though we
continue to import our tea until some
famine forces ns to grow our own—it might
taste better out of a delicately-formed Aus-
tralian cup that the fingers of no person
overseas had touched. We produce powerful
hewers of wood and drawers of water, and
from the ranks of these we are slowly select-
ing a few beaters of iron and moulders of
drain-pipes; but a national ambition that
does not take in the finer things of life —
which are also in some respects the simpler
things—does not go very far.

When Britain Looked South
The English-Dutch-Portuguese-French con-
flict for the overlordship of India and the
East Indies had much to do with directing
the attention of the British Government to
the possibilities of planting settlements in
Australia; and if for nothing else, then be-
cause of that Australians will find matter
of great interest in Early English Adven-
turers in the East, by Arnold Wright
(Andrew Melrose) —a stirring story which
we of these days of narrower vision should
be the better for reading.
The Spanish-Portnguese dominion in the
Orient was still undetermined when the Great
Armada perished on the rugged coasts of
Scotland and Ireland. In 1597 a fleet under
Cornelius Houtman laid the foundation of
Dutch power in the Eastern Archipelago—-a
challenge (as Dutch enterprise always was)
to the might of England. In acceptance of
the challenge a company was formed under
a charter granted by Elizabeth, and a fleet
of five ships was sent out to open up a new
empire. After a perilous voyage Lancaster,
tlie leader, landed at Acheen, in Sumatra,
where he was received by the King, who
entertained him at a banquet, where they
ate off plates of precious metal and were
entertained with dancing damsels “richly
attired and adorned with bracelets and
jewels.” But Lancaster did not make a suc-
cess of trading—a failure, however, which
lie made good by the capture of a mighty
Portuguese galleon laden with wealth to the
brim. A quaint scene took place at his de-
parture, the King asking: “Have you _ the
Psalms of David extant among you?” “Yes,”
said the General, “we sing them daily.”
“Then,” said the King, “I and my nobles will
sing a psalm to God for your prosperity.”
When this was done Lancaster and his men
“sung another psalm and so took leave.”
Several notable adventurers followed Lan-
caster, but the next Englishman to make a
mark was William Hawkins, who was sent
as envoy in the reign of Jame.s I. to the
Court of Jehangir, son of the great Akbar, at
Agra. Jehangir was a rank degenerate,
stained with crime but blessed with a sense
of humor and not without ability. So taken
was he with Hawkins that he made him an
allowance of £3200 a year with the command
of 400 horse. * “By accepting this,” wrote
Hawkins to the India Company, his employ-,
crs, “I should feather my nest and doe you
service.” One quaint feature noted by Haw-
kins was that Jehangir kept a Court reporter
and official records—-a sort of Oriental Han-
sard. Boe, an Englishman who rose subse-
quently to favor, was shocked at the idea
that the report of the day’s durbar discus-
sions could be bought for two shillings,
that the “common, base people should know
all the news of the day, and that the King’s
new resolutions were tossed and censured
by every rascall.” Roe also noticed that at
a reception the Emperor’s wives “broke holes
in the reed screen in order to gaze at me
and make merry.” “They were carried,” he
says, “like paraketoes in cages half a mile
behind their lord and master.”
Had it not been for the more powerful
attractions of India it is probable that the
English would have fought tjie Dutch to the
death for the mastery of the East Indies.
The name “Spice Islands” had always been
a magnet to attract the daring souls of
Europe. The English, under Drake in 1679,
were the first to visit them, but neglected
to follow up their opportunities, whereas the
Dutch, with their native shrewdness, instead
of merely sending out a ship or two, directed
a constant succession of well-equipped fleets
which penetrated to every part of the archi-
pelago. Their first task was to expel the
Portuguese and Spanish; this accomplished,
they set up a claim to a monopoly of the
trade of the islands. England disputed this,
alleging that, had she not defeated the
Armada, Holland could never have grappled
with the Spanish power in the East, The
early English traders who contrived to open
up relations with the Moluccas were solemnly
warned off, and found it expedient to heed
the warning. At the headquarters of the
Dutch ruled Jan PietersoU Coon, the great-
est of all Holland’s Governors-General of
Netherlands India. A stern, unyielding man,
Coon inspired the Dutch monopolistic policy,
and by his determination and craft made, it
successful. Opposed to him was Jourdaifi,
a staunch old English bulldog type of com-
mander, who only needed backing to make
him put through any enterprise. Between
these two warring Powers the hapless natives
were ground to powder. “Pointing to the
Dutch fort two of the natives cried out:
‘lt makes old men to weep and wish that
the child that is unborn shall be born dead,
as God hath sent these Hollanders to be a
plage unto them to take their country from
them.’ ” Jourdain took possession of one
or two small islands, and built a fort and
factory. Courthope, another of the com-
pany’s commanders, took possession of the
small island of Poolo Roon, the natives agree-
ing to a transfer, which was made in proper
fashion, “with eajrth and a young nutmeg-
tree, and with writings drawn and confirmed
under the hand of the principal gentry, and
the seal and chop of the country.” Court-
hope was a singularly indomitable fellow.
Desertion by some of his allies-, supineness
on the part of the authorities, sickness—all
these failed to dismay him. F-inally, en-
trapped by the Dutch, “betrayed, the intrepid
Courthope stood up in his tiny craft like a
lion at bay, returning shot for shot, until his
piece was choked and he could fire no more.
He still maintained an undaunted mien, till
a shot struck him full in the breast, when
without a moment’s hesitation he jumped
into the water and was seen no more.”
One of the darkest stories in the long
contest was the tragedy of Amboyna, a
Dutch possession of which it was said :
“Amboina sitteth as a queen between the
Isles of Banda and the Moluccas.” The
Dutch, who had built a castle and were
strongly fortified, were jealous of a little
handful of Englanders who had settled there
to trade. A Japanese accused these men of
conspiracy, and tile Governor, Van Speult,
lost his head and subjected the hapless
Britons to most hideous tortures to make
them confess they had conspired against the
Dutch. The ena of it all was that ten
Englishmen, including Towerson, their lead-
ing man, were publicly executed. “A strange
distinction was made in Towerson’s case.
Prior to his execution there was placed
about the block a piece of black velvet in
deference to his rank.” (The East India
Company was afterwards, in a bill of
charges, debited with the value of this
material on the grounds that the bloodstains
had spoiled it) This affair practically closed

P. AIREY.
Rondeau and Triolet
“J.M.D.’s” statement (R.P. 10/10/’25),
apropos of the triolet and the rondeau, that
form is the easiest thing in poetry, reminds
me of the near-cultured Sydney bookseller
who told the astonished Frank Morton (a
recognised student and practitioner of fixed
forms) that writing triolets was the easiest
thing out; he had often dashed off a few.
When Morton got his breath lie asked him
to recite one, and he would publish it if it
passed muster. But the dear fellow had
forgotten them all, he had written so many.
“J.M.D.” quotes, first of all, a freak thing
by the fifteenth-century Dc Croi, and sug-
gests it has never been bettered by the
thousands of triolets which have followed
it. He adds that he has never seen —nor
has any man—one that was worth the writ-
ing. Coming from one who modestly allows
that perhaps it is a hard thing to dog-
matise on the subject, this is very precious
criticism. There are many anthologies of
work in the French fixed forms, and the
surprising thing about the triolets is their
generally high average of merit. Frequently
you will' come across one of distinction. The
triolet is, within its restricted limits, almost
an epitome of the several othey forms. Its
laws as to rhymes and refrains are more
rigid than those of the rondeau and villan-
elle. But this matter of immutable form
(anything but easy, and only to be got with
infinite practice and care) does not by any
means imply chains or verbal acrobatics.
Rather, it gives rein to the gentlest play of
fancy, to a pretty mischievousness, grace
and melody.
The best examples are in Old French;
but there are triolets by Henley, Dobson
and Andrew Lang that are always refreshing
to turn to, “charming, playfully sly, with
their tiny trill of epigrammatic melody turn-
ing so simply upon its own innocent axis.”
These by Austin Dobson are typical. To
say they are no better than De Croi’s and
not worth the writing is mere petulance:—•
A GREEK GIFT.
Here’s a present for Rose,
How pleased she is looking!
Is it verse? Is it prose?
Here’s a present for Rose!
“Plats,” “Entrees,” and “Rets,”
Why, it’s “Gouffe on Cooking”!
Here’s a present for Rose,
How pleased she is looking!
LOVE’S BUT A DANCE.
Oh, Love’s but a dance,
Where Time plays the fiddle!
See the couples advance —
Oli! Love’s but a dance !
A whisper, a glance,
“Shall we twirl down the middle?”
Oh, Love’s but a dance,
Where Time plays the fiddle !
When “J.D.M.” says he has never seen a
rondeau that was great poetry, he is right
to a point. But poetry can have most of
the attributes of greatness, even if of slight
content. A sonnet by Sliakspeare, a ballade
by Villon, a lyric by Keats are great in the
sense that they are perfect in construction,
thought and emotion. No one looks for the
qualities of an epic or an ode. or the
strength and passion of the greatest of poetry,
in a rondeau. The singing power is, after
all, what matters. That, and those other
qualities which all poetry that is not mere
pleasant tinkling demands, faultless rhythm,
elegance of expression, harmony of sound,
clarity of thought. A perfect rondeau con-
tains " all these. The favorite example in
French is by Venture. I give the English
paraphrase by Austin Dobson as the easier
to follow: —
Ycm bid me try. Blue-eyes, to write
A Rondeau. What! forthwith? —to-night?
Reflect, Some skill I have, ’tis true;
But thirteen lines ! —and rhymed on two !
“Refrain” as well. Ah, hapless plight!
Still, here' are five lines —ranged aright.
These Gallic bonds, I feared, would fright
My easy muse. They did, till you—-
You bid me try!
That makes them eight. The port’s in sight.
’Tis all because your eyes are bright!
Now just a pair to end in “oo”
When maids command, what can’t we do!
Behold ! The rondeau —tasteful, light—
You bid me try !
What is that but spontaneous dancing, and
where are the chains? Dobson has written
others, and Henley, and some of the Ameri-
cans ; not all great poetry, perhaps, but some
perfect within their own limits. To strike
a more sedate note, this one by Villon, trans-
lated by John Payne; a slight variation
from Voiture’s model, but permissible:—
Death, of thy- rigor I complain,
That hast my lady torn from me,
And yet wilt not contented be,
Till from me too all strength be ta'en
For languishment of heart and brain.
What harm did she in life to thee,
Death ?
One heart we had betwixt us twain;
Which being dead, I too must dree
Death, or, like carven saints we see
In Choir, sans life to live be fain.
Death!
The whole subject is a most entrancing one.
I had wished “J.M.D.” had included the
villanelle and the ballade among his detesta-
tions. For then I had had firmer grounds
for my defence; as in those two forms there
are examples by Villon, Swinburne and

CAMDEN MORRISBY.
Lowbrow Literature for Highbrows
We are all novelists nowadays, and Cax-
ton’s oven groans day and night under the
stupendous burden of getting our vapons-
ings on to the market. Anyone _ who can
put imaginary characters into imaginary
situations and many who cannot, anyone
who thinks she can plumb the depths of the
human mind, is at liberty to spawn a
slovenly tale, and it will probably find its
way into print. The result is that we are
in danger of forgetting that, after all, “the
story is what counts”; more novels than
not are simply jejune raipblings in "psycho-
logy” or in "character.” Studies in "atmo-
sphere,” studies in futility, studies in pessi-
mism, to the unsophisticated reader all tend
to become studies in dulness. He turns
away to entertainments which do not pro-
voke him by grandiose aims and feeble re-
sults, turns to the old, old form of entertain-
ment —a man telling a story for the story s
sake. Here is one field that demands real
care and, at least, some ability. And in this
field the detective story leads easily.
There are, one must admit, shockingly bad
detective stories —some are nearly as dull
as an English imitation of a Russian novel
—but the experienced detective-story reader
will not brook a badly-told tale, while the
inexperienced (if any there be) will simply
learn from one bitter dose to avoid as a
plague the author of such stories as are open
to Oscar Wilde’s stricture that, “as we read
on, the suspense of the author becomes
almost unbearable.” The result is that some
of the best craftsmen in letters of the day
are using the medium of the mystery and
detective story. They put into it admirable
constructive skill, remarkable grace and wit,
even ideas and some expression of “moral
values.” We can easily conceive the time
when the ordinary novel becomes so hope-
lessly shapeless that the writer with some-
thing to say will almost inevitably put it into
the form of a “sensational” story to get it
read at all by intelligent people. The
“Father Brown” stories of Chesterton, lhe
Black Circle,” by Cuthbert Baines and “The
Viaduct Murder” by Father Knox spring to
the mind at once in this connection. As yet
this is only a tendency: it is a straw that
may be showing merely the direction of a
temporary eddy in the literary atmosphere;
yet, for all we can say now, it may be an
indication of the direction from which, pre-
sently, the very hurricane of literary effort
will be coming. The general fact remains,
though, whatever it may indicate: the detec-
tive story of to-day is on a very high level
of achievement.
It is a far cry in these days from the
manner and methods of the fathers of the
mystery story, from Collins and the
technically American Edgar Allan Poe
from Sherlock Holmes even. J. S. Fletcher
has given the detective story dignity and a
charm which other literary forms might with
advantage emulate; John Buchan is a writer
of unusual quality who has brought the gifts
which caused him to be chosen as the official
historian of the war to the service of the
tale of mystery; Storer Clouston, famous for
his “Lunatic at Large,” is far too little re-
cognised for his possession of a rich and
delightful style, probably because he has lav-
ished it on mere mystery ; A. E. W. Mason
is an honorable veteran in this field; Eden
Phillpotts has recently turned to the story of
crime and added to it his meticulous care
in the delineation of character, though a few
readers know the couple of sensational stories
written by him in collaboration with Arnold
Bennett many years ago; A. A. Milne, fresh
from triumphs on the stage, wrote a highly
entertaining detective story. “The Red House
Mystery”; Baroness Orczy, the double per-
sonality who has also written the Pimpernel
stories,' has shown her undoubted ability in
handling an unusual type of detective yarn ;
and other well-known names could be cited
of writers of some weight who have thrown
it as ballast into this type of tale.
More recently there has grown up a crop
of new writers of more than promise: Agatha
Christie’s “Man in the Brown Suit” is a
little gem, shot through with the strange
lights of anthropology, of all things ; Freeman
Wills Crofts has written several detective
tales, of which the best are “The Groote
Park Murder” and “Inspector French s Last
Case”; the Coles, G.D.H. and Margaret
famous for their activities in the sober high-
ways of social science, have written two,
the latest with the engaging title, “Death or
a Millionaire”; a lady named
Sayers recently published “Whose Body? a
mystery tale of very real importance, lit up
with unusual humorous power and giving-
evidence of considerable psychological in-
sight. Ronald Knox (Father Knox) mixes
the detective story with social and ethical
discussion, producing a delightful amalgam.
G. K. Chesterton deserves mention all on
his own. He uses the methods —mystery,
suspense and so on —of the detective story to
emphasise his peculiar philosophy, and many
of the stories have, in conseouence, remark-
able power. No one before Chesterton
thought that this form could be used for
pointing serious ethical truths; and when
the thing is done wfith the extraordinary
charm that Chesterton commands the result
is irresistible. No reader can afford to miss
the joy of reading the “Father Brown’
stories. Almost in the same breath should be
mentioned “The Black Circle,’’ by Cuthbert
Baines —a verv remarkable piece of work,
scarcely a detective story technically, but
certainly a “sensational” story, though it is
a new flower grown from the grafting of buds
from social theory and old-style melodrama
on to the unpromising stem of the story of
Utopia! “The Black Circle” is not nearly
so well known as it should be.
Perhaps it would be polite to glance at
America, though that unfortunate country
can scarcely sustain the glance with com-
posure. The general level of detective story-
writing (as of all other kinds of writing) by
Americans is pathetically low. Mary Rob-
erts Rineheart sometimes rises above the
average a little. Louis Vance ought to be
mentioned, and Carolyn Wells enjoys an
ill-deserved reputation. A book of some
quality (for other reasons) is “The House
of Fear,” by R. Camp. But really the only
detective stories worth any notice at all
are a series called “The Notorious Sophie
Lang,” and these are more to be admired
for the promise held forth by their style
than for their strict achievement as detec-
tive stories.
The book for which we are all waiting is
the sensational story which will bear out all
the promise scattered through so many of
the later books: a mystery tale' that will
combine a sensitive, moving manner with
a genuine sense for the mysteries of human
conduct and motive, and a straightforward
and workmanlike ability to construct a story
intelligently. When that happens a new
literary form will have been perfected.
Will it come out of Australia?
WARREN GRSVES.
A View of Modern Art
I have just returned to London from Paris.
It is many, years since I was there, and I
almost wish I had not gone again, for as the
Mecca of the art student it is no more.
The anarchy which passes for modern French
art is all that remains. When I first arrived
at the modern shows, I wondered if my eyes
saw ariglit. 1 searched a long time to dis-
cover redeeming features, but there were too
few to reward the search. I went from show
to show, always hoping that I might find
sanity ; but beyond jti rare patch there was
nothing. Draughtsmanship is an unknown
quality, color and composition are worse.
Of all the multitudinous nudes I saw one
that was good. Exhibitions of modern Illus-
trative Art were almost as bad. Some of
the wood-blocks were fair, but even these,
as a rule, lack sincerity. The message the
more execrable of the works were supposed
to convey only the authors of the abomi-
nations know. In the collections were a few
etchings which were good, and also some
decorative book covers; apart from these it
was mostly an orgy of hideousness.
The exhibition of Decorative Art was in-
teresting, and in parts really good. Many
of the buildings impressed me as being a re-
flection of the metal age in which we live.
The lines were severe. Much of the fur-
niture appears to have been designed on the
same principles. I suppose this simplicity
of line is a reaction from the flamboyant
style of French decoration. Some of the
architectural exhibits suggest a striving
after effect, and not coming off too well —
a melange of the barbaric and ultra-modern,
and most of it too ponderous to be pleasing.
I endeavored to re-adjust my mind to this
viewpoint, but was not very successful: I
wearied of the cubes and prisms and absence
of repose which were the predominating fea-
tures. The British exhibit was the worst, and
the Italian the best ; the latter based on old
Roman lines. The arches were a refreshing
relief from the austerity of the other build-
ings—austerity without beauty.
The exhibit which interested me most was
Toyland. The dolls were delightful, and some
of them extremely quaint. But even here
one found the passion for angles, which was
also marked in the Salon des Modes. Here
the divine feminine had shed her divinity.
At the Rodin Museum there were more
shocks. Undeniably Rodin was a genius,
and some of his earlier masterpieces hold
one spellbound. I could hardly drag myself
from one to the other, he . lifted me to the
heights and then —what can I say? I lay no
claims to prudery, but I don’t think I ever
felt so revolted as when I discovered that
such a genius as Rodin could play to such
a gallery. But what magnificence of execu-
tion! How alive! In the Middle Ages, and
even down to the beginning of last century,
customs and morals were very crude; yet
there is little, if any, of this degeneracy to
be seen in their art. The mixture of the
barbarities of the savage with the sophistry
of civilisation is hardly a success. Whether
this is a result of the war or the war the result
of this decadence is a moqt point.
It was always a relief to get into the
Louvre and amongst the giants of the past.
There was a period in my life when I de-
tested what I considered the cant about the
Old Masters. Why live in the past? Now
I have the answer. But the chief thought
that I carry away to cherish is that the col-
lections of Valasquez, Frans Hals and Rem-
brandt which we have in the British National
Gallery are finer than those in the Louvre.
Of course one must still go to the Louvre
for the most glorious of the eighteenth-cen-
tury French masters. What exquisite purity
of form in comparison with the voluptuous
nudes of some of the others, more particularly
the moderns! And one must still go to Paris
for statuary for the adornment of street and
park. In ‘London the latest things are the
most abominable; for example, the Epstien
memorial to Hudson, the greatest piece of
impertinence that this city has suffered for
many a day.
ELLIS SILAS.
A Satchel of Books
Canyon Gold, by A. P. Hankins (Macaulay Co.).
Gold, guns and a girl; being a story of the wild
West done in the American language. It is full of
primary color, red and yellow predominating, and
moves with a whoop. A movie in printer’s ink.
The Crystal Cup, by Gertrude Atherton (John
Murray). The writer of a sheaf of adventures in
fiction has done better work than this, which
purports to present a picture of New York society
in post-war days—a picture of unsexed womanhood
and inane, fibreless manhood gorged with dollars.
That there is another world of Americans none of
us can doubt; and it would serve the nation better if
its writers, even its novelists, set it oftener before
our eyes.
Calendar, University of Sydney (Angus and Robert-
son). The curse of lack of pence that has for so
many generations rested upon the calling of letters
seems to be reflected in the scant attention it re-
ceives in the list of scholarships, exhibitions, etc.,
available at Sydney University. The sum total of the
prizes awarded for compositions is less than £lOO.
Wentworth, the founder of the Uni., made his mark
in literature by a very close run-up for the Chan-
cellor’s medal at Cambridge with his well-known poem
having aspirations for “a new Britannia in another
world.” That was in 1823. A century has elapsed,
and while Arts, Medicine. Surgery, Law, Economics,
Architecture, Education, Engineering, Psychiatry, and
even Veterinary Science flourish under a Danse shower
of gold, the poor poet and prose writer are cheered
with a few odd tenners and fivers. For 1926 they
are invited to concentrate on a poem in rhyme of
at least one hundred lines on “A tribute to a great
man no longer living,” to furnish essays on “The
conditions necessary for the development of a national
drama” and to say what they think of “Australian
poetry—its place and promise in the great tradition
of English poetry.” Two Beauchamp prizes of £25
each are the flowers of the flock ; and their subject-
matters are respectively “Peace and War and Poetry”
and “The Russian Revolution.” It does seem time
that the poet and his small brother the journalist
promoted some sort of revolution in the ’Varsity.

Electric Fans.
Good health is equally dependent upon correct food,
pure water and fresh, “live” air. Of these three
essentials the last is easier to attain, and perhaps the
most rarely-found in the average home.
The practical and economical returns from an instal-
lation of (|&)Fans in stores, theatres and hotels are
evidenced by increased patronage by a comfort-loving
public; in shops and factories by better morale, and often
by better production, and in offices by more alert and
accurate attention to duty.
(s|) Fans are built to last for many years to satisfy
the artistic eye, to harmonise with the decorative scheme
of their surroundings, to serve comfort and health.

are initials of a friend.

The Return.
The trees that were not my trees
Were planted yesterday
In dull and sombre twos and threes
Up and down the way.
There was a mist about my heart,
A shadow at my door;
My looking eyes could see no part
Of all I saw before.
The grass whose blades were all my friends
Had wished me no good day;
For I was at the world’s ends
And both of them were grey.
Both grey and strangers in my mood
With black looks cast between;
The clouds with drooping foreheads stood
And rain came cold and mean.
This morning brought a yellow light
Splashing down the hill;
My own trees rising from the night
Were all there still;
And the grass was all my grass,
Spear and tufted plume—
It clapped its hands to hear me pass,
And bowed and gave me room.
Wednesday was born a twin
With Tuesday long ago;
And all the threads of time spiu
From wool of words we know.
I was a stranger yesterday
When Tuesday passed me by;
And now the love of all the way
Is in my thought and eye.
For Wednesday has said a word,
As the good days will;
And what it said is like a bird
Below a cedar hill.
All the quiet day it sits
With plumes to preen and part;
But all the night it sings and flits
Up and up my heart.
And only you shall know, dear,
The good song it sings,
You that knew the grey fear
That came before the wings.

Opal.
When I came to Sydney town —
Roving that my heart might rest—
Sydney ’neath a golden crown
Wore a lupin-tinted gown,
And an opal at her breast.
And an opal at her breast,
How it glittered in the sun!
Oh, the watchers never guessed
Of the guerdon of my quest,
Of the guerdon that I won.
Of the guerdon that I won
From the opal’s tender deep!
How the little days have run
In, the world of things undone
'And the joys they cannot keep!
And the joys they cannot keep,
How they haunt the heart of me!
• Oh, the eyes that came to weep,
And the eyes, alas, that sleep
In an opal’s memory!

CECIL MANN
Sorrow in the Wind.
Why do I weep when the wind is blowing
And I sit still in the upstairs room
Watching the eerie branches throwing
Shadowy shapes to the curtained gloom,
Hearing against the window smashing,
Pctalled foam of the orchard’s bloom?
What is there brings to my secret being
Thoughts that are wild and washed with
tears,
Fugitive visions, long past seeing,
Touched with a thousand lialf-felt fears !
What is there brings on the wind, unbidden,
Sorrows of far-gone, shrouded years?
Child of some ancient incarnation,
Did I, weeping, wait while a moor-wind
cried,
Stinging me there to a desperation,
As I watched the path where my lord
would ride—
Watched from a mullionCd castle-window
For one who would never come to my side t
Did I kneel in the cloisters, prayers intoning,
A snow-white coif round my shaven head,
Hearing the voice of a lost wind moaning,
Telling my beads while my spirit bled—
I with my cheeks of paling roses,
Held in the house of the living dead?
Did I roam blue-lipped o’er the shaken
heather,
Bare of foot in the icy mire,-
Wrapping my shawl ’gainst the windy
weather,
Crying my need of a warm, red fire,
Pulling the purple and scarlet berries,
A gypsy maid, with the heath my sire?
Or out in the woods dark-stemmed and olden,
Hiding there in the autumn rain,
Did I hear the wind in the beech-trees golden
And the clash of swords again and again ?
Did I kiss the lips of a cold, white lover
Prone on the turf with its spreading stain?
Why do I weep when the wind comes crying
And I sit here in the house alone
Listening to shrill songs dying, dying—
Trumpet calls on the dark night biown?
Is it that I am haunted, hearing
Strains from a sad past, dimly known?

POLITICAL LABOR AND PUBLIC
SERVANTS.
Encouraged by recent events in N. S. Wales
and Queensland, a section of the Common-
wealth public servants is noisily siding with
Ciiarlton in the argument which will be
settled, one way or another, on November
14. It hopes thereby to secure a Fed-
eral Labor Administration savagely in-
tolerant of officers whose principles forbid
them to join A.L.P. unions—as savagely
intolerant as the Sydney Government and
City Council, and as cravenly submissive to
Government-service unionists of the right
color as the Queensland Gillies crowd. And
the Federal Labor party, being in desperate
straits,_ is bidding eagerly for the .vote. As
usual, it is alleged that “the service is seeth-
ing with discontent.” In the minds of
“advanced’' Laborites the seething condition
is continual when the other side is in office.
Let us consider for a moment what there
really is to seethe about.
* * * *
The Federal public servant has a steady
job at a decent wage. Hours are short, holi-
days numerous (three weeks p.a., besides
12 public holidays, and six months after 20
years’ service), and sick leave on full pay
is granted on a generous scale. In 1923, the
latest year reported on by the Health De-
partment, 63 p.c. of the employees drew sick
pay, amounting to £132,307; 80 p.c. of the
female employees concerned were prostrated
for an average of 16.6 days, and 60 p.c.
of the males for an average of 12.9. Then
there are “higher-duties” allowances, child-
endowment payments (ss. for each child
under the age of 14 years), and superannua-
tion benefits, the superannuation scheme
having been introduced by Groom, the pre-
sent Attorney-General, and dated back to
1920. According to the last report of the
Public Service Board, a youngster of 21
on the lowest grade of clerical work gets
£216 p.a., and in five years works up to £276.
If lie marries and becomes a father he draws
another ss. a week for each child ; if he re-
tires on the ground of ill-health he gets a
full pension provided he can show that he is
50 p.c. incapacitated, and when death comes,
be it soon or late, his dependants are pro-
vided for. The Postmaster-General employs
more than two-thirds of the total number in
the Federal service; and here, it seems,
the seething is worst. The report of
that Department for 1923-24 (it wasn’t
issued till recently) shows that there
were 20,705 salaried officers on June 30,
1924, and that the. average salary was
£233 9s. 9d. p.a., or practically £4 10s. a
week. Not at all bad considering that the
positions are permanent, that they carry
valuable rights and privileges not reckoned
in the £233 9s. 9d. p.a., and that a large
proportion of the 20,705 officers are lads and
young women! There are staff cafeterias
and dining-rooms in most of the big
post-offices, and for those who want
to get on there are free educational
classes in which 20 subjects are taught,
among them French, shorthand, mathematics,
history, wireless, motor-driving, telephony,
electrical technology and engineering draw-
ing. And, in recalling that the departmental
profit shrank considerably in 1923-24, the
Postmaster-General explains that this was
due in part to £244,715, or £ll 16s. 3d. per
officer, being set aside for “increased super-
annuation liabilities.” Which shows that
the provision of superannuation benefits for
Federal public servants is already an ex-
pensive business, and the burden on the
taxpayer, especially as regards the employees
in departments which yield no revenue, will
get heavier every year.
* * * *
In spite of all these facts, a recent confer-
ence of Federal public servants painted a
harrowing picture of their condition and
that of their fellow-serfs who were not repre-
sented, and suggested that only by selling
their block vote to the Labor party, which
was in the market with a blank cheque, would
their misery be alleviated. Also a Jetter
leapt to light in which one Murnane, secre-
tary of the Amalgamated Linemen, Sorters
and Letter-carriers, informed a “dear com-
rade” (one of many, it is presumed) that
the letter had been appointed to go among
his fellow-employees and “collect as much
money as possible in support of the Labor
party, which has promised to remedy our
long-standing grievances” ; that “if the Tories
are returned the Board will be our only
court of appeal and arbitration will be a
thing of the past” (a brazen untruth) ; and
th"t “everything hinges on the return of
Labor to power, and whatever Self-denial is
practised by members in the way of substan-
tial donations ivill be amply repaid.” The
writer did not mention what would happen
to the “comrade” who ignored the letter or
refused to contribute should Federal Labor
regain power, but the actions of the N.S.W.
Lang Government, which degraded loyal
railwaymen in the interests of war strikers,
and bludgeoned a validating bill through the
Assembly when the monstrous proceeding
was declared illegal, make it easy to guess.
This particular union is one of 12 Federal-
service organisations, seven of which are
non-political. It is unlikely that the members
of these seven organisations will vote for a
party which may crush them as ruthlessly
as the Lang Government is crushing the non-
political organisations in the State railway
service. In any case the probability of a
Federal Labor Government is too remote to
be worth considering. But the enlarged
Commonwealth Crimes Act which the Red
insurrection has rendered necessary should
certainly prescribe terms of imprisonment for
people who extort political contributions from
Government employees by forms of black-
mail or offer to pay for their votes out of
the nublic purse.

PEACE AND UNCLE SAM.
The agreement put together at Locarno for
perpetual peace and politeness, or as much
perpetualness of these virtues as it is pos-
sible to arrive at, is only a scrap of paper;
but no one knows how to make an agree-
ment which amounts to more than that. Even
if the Council of the League of Nations was
a governing institution with an international
army at its command, its component parts
would be liable to part company despite any
written admission that they oughtn’t to, and
the army might break up any day into sev-
eral armies, which would go for : each other
in the old familiar style. It is at least
something that the representatives of the
majority of the peoples that count contrived
to get simultaneously around the same scrap
of paper, and that all of them got away alive.
The ill-assorted trinity of big States which
stands out consists of Mexico, the United
States and Soviet Russia. Mexico has been
in a huffy condition for some time about the
difficulty of securing prompt recognition of
its rather fleeting Governments, and in any
ease its big neighbor doesn’t want it to get
into “European entanglements,” which might
bring along European protection. The
United States desires world peace without
any responsibility for helping to keep the
peace, and it manoeuvres accordingly. And
it is next door to impossible to invite Soviet
Russia into any gentlemanly League until
it acquires the rudiments of table manners.
It is announced, however, that President
Coolidge proposes to utilise the situation by
urging a larger and more general disarma-
ment than has been yet suggested—that he
wants the people of Locarno to back up their
words with deeds on a generous scale.
The United States is peculiarly situated
in relation to these problems. Seven years
ago it got to the end of its 19tli war—l 9 in
143 years. Most of the scraps were with
people of small calibre, and the majority
were conducted on a very cheap scale. The
scale was so cheap that in 13 well-defined
and empire-building struggles the total num-
ber of U.S. troops engaged was 451,777,
being an average of 37,060 per struggle. The
Great War was our Uncle’s first meeting
with a first-class enemy who had to be pur-
sued to a serious distance, for George lll.’s
largely-alien and hireling army wasn’t first-
class, and it came to look for Uncle at its
own cost, instead of having to be looked for.
To people accustomed to pile up provinces
at an amazingly low cost, the recent affair
was a revelation. It was forced upon them
with piratical brutality by a remote enemy
who took the situation in his own hands.
It brought no accession of territory. The
U.S. Army fought, for the first time, under
a foreign commander, and, vast though it
was, it played a subordinate part. And the
fact was borne in upon the national con-
sciousness that the Republic had either for-
gotten the art of scientific warfare or had
never learned it, that the art took more learn-
ing than anybody had supposed, that Uncle
was no very rapid pupil aud had to rely
to an unexpected degree on foreign instruc-
tors, and that if the trouble had been solely
between the Republic and the Kaiser start-
ling events might have happened to the
former before any real defence was ready.
It is natural, therefore, for it to suggest
that Europe should disarm to a point which
will make any repetition of the outrage im-
probable, if not impossible. The plan would
involve no corresponding reduction of the
recognised United States forces, for the
standing army is only 145,000 strong, and
though that is 20 times the size of the Aus-
tralian standing army, which local traitors
seek to destroy lest it should lead to “mili-
tarism,” the Republic considers itself prac-
tically disarmed already. But it would lead
to a diminution of rival forces. Calvin
Coolidge’s country would be left with two
harmless neighbors—Mexico, which hasn’t
been regarded as a fighting proposition since
the days of Santa Ana, and demilitarised
Canada. It is fairly safe against war sur-
prises, such as Greece sprung on Bulgaria
the other day. And though there are still
regions, such as, China and Turkestan, where
forces might be quietly organised for the
astonishment of a disarmed civilisation, they
would be Europe’s funeral —not America’s.
The disarmament programme aims, to a
very considerable extent, at lowering the
quality of the military establishment, and
making the' way more easy for backward
nations. (Not so much is said about the
reduction of the naval establishment, and
some otherwise pacific folk are showing con-
siderable energy in building up this appara-
tus of oversea aggression.) The Commu-
nists, who are the most earnest advocates
of disarmament, urge that both the quality
and the quantity should be reduced out of
sight. But the U.S. idea of disarmament is
not the Communist idea. President Coolidge
is Commander-in-Chief of a regular and
admitted army of about 145,000 men, of
whom 37,000 are in the colonies and the
rest at home. But lie is also head of a
Reserve Officers Corps and a Reserve Offi-
cers Training Corps, the two numbering
about 185,000. In addition, lie is boss of
a little-known and much-overlooked force,
with a present authorised strength of 424,000
men, which is not included in any disarma-
ment projects. This is the National Guard,
a collection of State regiments, but armed,
equipped and supervised by tlie Federal
authority. It is so much Federal that the
President may, in certain emergencies, call
it out for service without waiting to con-
sult Congress. It exists principally for the
suppression of Communists and their kind
when they make themselves too conspicuous,
and to fake a hand in “industrial troubles”
when they develop into plain treason and
insurrection. In fact, Uncle Samuel goes
about with a gun in one hand and the ISth
amendment of the Constitution in the other,
resolved to sell his political freedom dearly,
just as he buys his drinks. His disarma-
ment inspirations don’t apply to internal
affairs. One result of this attitude is that
there are only two Socialists among 531
Federal legislators. They don’t call them-
selves Communists, however much they may
want to.
RED RAGS AND LIBERTY.
When Nebuchadnezzar set up his famous
image on the plain of Babylon and called
upon all the nations then gathered about the
Euphrates to fall down and worship the
article at the first burst of sound from his
brazen instruments, he was instituting a
policy as like modern Communism as pos-
sible. Under his despotism lie sought for
complete uniformity. Internationalism had
already been achieved by the simple process
of sweeping whole nations into the great
melting-pot of the Euphrates valley ; and all
had to acknowledge the same religion. The
basis of the communistic idea is Uniformity.
In theory it is uniformity that there may be
equality; but the struggle for uniformity has
in no modern instance been successful enough
to allow an opportunity for testing the
equality. What is clear is that uniformity
and personal freedom cannot exist together.
Uniformity can only be secured under an
iron despotism; and it matters very little
whether the despots are hereditary rulers or
leaders selected by some communistic organi-
sation. Possibly the most remarkable in-
stance of a working Communism was that
which the Spaniards found in Peru undfer
tlie despotism of the Incas. One Inca emperor
ruled, with 10,060 Incas to carry out his
instructions; and four or five millions of
mild Indians lived a life of equality in a
territory several thousands of miles in ex-
tent. From Ecuador to Chili and far back
into the modern Bolivia the working Indians
had practically the same food, the same
clothing, the same housing conditions and
an equal amount of labor. They had also
the same narrowed outlook, the same cer-
tainty that things could never be any better,
the same forced obedience and the same
knowledge that, however life irked, to-
morrow would be exactly like to-day.
* * * *
What the Inca achieved with his easily
managed Indian populations has been the
dream of almost every despotism. Uni-
formity was the first aim. No single-handed
ruler ever desired inequality among his sub-
jects. To bring them to a dead level was to
make the supremacy of his rule the more
certain; and the first step towards that
dead level of equality was necessarily a dead
level of uniformity in outlook. There is no
possibility, from the natural make-up of
mankind, of having a state of Communism
without rulers. An iron system of com-
mand is necessary to make any approach to
such a system workable. Committees may
pretend to rule, but the movement will soon
fall to pieces unless those committees are
dominated by strong men. That Communism
could mean mob-rule—-and no doubt many
who talk about revolution desire that it
should mean mob-rule—is absurd. Tlie mob
might rule for an hour in one street or one
town; but order must be restored under
individuals, and the selection of those indi-
viduals cannot in the nature of things be
very carefully considered. Mob-rule —the
communist means of reaching its object—
implies terror, atrocity, pain, hunger and
confusion ; and, in the midst of all that, men
are to be suddenly chosen to attempt the
tasks which have baffled great emperors with
absolute will to create tlie conditions
the communists seek, and with huge disci-
plined armies to carry out that will!
It is necessarily the desperate man
rather than the able man who is chosen.
World revolutions have indeed thrown up
their Cromwells and Napoleons ; but the
strong men found are never those who would
have the least faith in a system such as
Communism. The man required for an
organising task such as Communism de-
mands would be of the type which the world
already knows in industry and commerce;
and on the bare chance of such a man being
found and recognised in some revolutionary
committee any possible success of Commu-
nism must depend. So the communists are
prepared to gamble their own lives and the
happiness of all about them on the bare
chance that out of the turmoil a man may
be found such as the "world in the patient
calm of undisturbed thought has never been
able to discover. They gamble on even more
than this; the man so found must find others
to succeed him who are possessed of his own
ability and filled with his own spirit, or the
whole effort falls to pieces. And it is always
to be remembered that such men must work
without personal ambition under the most,
galling conditions, and subject to the con-
stant murmurs of the crowd and the con-
stant pinpricks of ignorant or self-seeking
rivals. Cromwell’s lonely and bitter path
would seem like a rose-strewn lawn beside
that of the new Cromwell of Communism.
* If * *
The lights of all history throw up the
communistic attempts as black shadows.
The white man values his personal liberty.
None in his senses would barter his liberty
at a reasonable living wage for even luxury
and wealth in a glorious prison. There is
not the smallest reason to suppose that the
universal prison, which is the ideal of Com-
munism, could ever be glorious or luxurious;
the one and only thing certain about it is
that it would mean universal loss of personal
freedom. In the countries where Commu-
nism has most adherents personal freedom
has long been restricted to the narrowest,
and the popular thought merely turns round
the moving from one prison to another after
a period of liberty to riot. Perhaps that
short-lived liberty of the revolutionary hour
is the chief lure. Where life has little charm
even a holiday of blood may seem attractive.
Rut to a free Australian the giving up of
liberty for such a remote possibility of gain
is unthinkable. Communism has nothing to
offer that is not far more easily obtained in
other ways without any such sacrifice. A
revolution would decrease production by one-
half; and the most even distribution pos-
sible:—supposing there were no large rob-
beries from the public purse, which there
would almost certainly be—would place the
whole population on the present basis of
the members of a family of six living on the
minimum wage of one worker. In other
words, equality after a revolution would
give each individual a little over two shil-
lings a day to live on, with food at least as
dear as it is at present. But it is equally
clear that we could be a great deal better
off. Double the production and the standard
of living must rise. The communistic idea
of pulling down the rich to the level of the
poor could accomnlish nothing; the deter-
mination to lift all to a condition of plenty
is both wiser and more practicable.
THINGS DONE IN AUSTRALIA.
I have just been reading what at first sight
I took to be- an advertising pamphlet. But
as I ran on I found that it was something
much more than that. If for simple pub-
licity purposes a firm issued a book which
cost very nearly a pound to produce, it would
at least .see that the copies went where they
would “pull” most business; and this
chronicle of the life of Macphehsgn Robert-
son, who is best known by bis business name
of Macßobertson, is not being circulated
in that direction at all. The man who de-
voted £20,000 to its production felt a pride
in his achievement of making a large for-
tune from scratch, and had the vision to see
patriotism in putting a record of it into the
hands of working men, and especially young
working men, in the hope that they too might


realise the great opportunities that exist in
Australia for the citizen with initiative and
the determination to succeed. lo such
people the book is delivered free.
Henry Ford, as a greatly successful busi-
ness organiser, has a literature of his own
which is often enough quoted m Australia,
why should not the man who has made him-
self a continent’s largest income-taxpayer
be similarly honored in his own country i
Both started poor, and out of keenness for
their work built large fortunes. But Henry
Ford had a country with a population ot a
hundred millions and a really protective
tariff to work in; Macßobertson made his
fortune in a country which only after the
war contained five millions, his market when
he started being the million and a quarter
of Victoria. By every basis of compari-
son his achievement is greater than that of
the American farmer’s son. His estimate, of
the value of his main business, for which
millions was offered and declined somo
years ago, is four millions ; but there are
half a dozen subsidiary businesses in which
he is the principal shareholder, the Maize
Products Proprietary, Ltd., alone having a
capital of a million.
In “A Young Man with a Nailcan ’ the
story of success is told. Macpherson
Robertson was born at Ballarat, and his
Scottish mother took him to live with
her own people in Leith when he was eight.
There he made in the first weeks of their
stay a compact with her —he would attend
regularly at school if he was allowed also
to work. He delivered papers, he lathered
customers (the newsagent was also the
barber) ; next he worked in a biscuit-factory,
a blacksmith’s shop, a coalyard, a hatter’s
and a printing office; then he got a job at
half a crown a week with a lolly-maker,
and that put a germ into his head. When
his mother brought him back to Victoria
after a year or two he was not ashore half
an hour before he had secured a job. The
family, walking down a street in Port Mel-
bourne, stood by a shop for a moment —
time enough for young Robertson to ask the
proprietor if he wanted a boy and to take the
job that immediately offered. He left it to
work with another lolly-maker—the germ in
his head growing—until he learnt the trade.
Then, at the age of 19, he bargained with
his mother for the use of her bathroom for
the manufacture of lollies on his own
account. A nailcan supplied his furnace, a
pannikin was his boiler, and plaster of Paris
moulds completed the equipment. When he
had made sufficient, he hawked his stock of
sugar dolls and horses from shop to shop.
The profits went into further equipment:
and it was not long before Robertson was
an employer, compelled by the growth of
custom to devote himself entirely to pro-
duction, and engage salesmen for outside
work.
That was in 1880. Five years later the
employees, housed in a one-storey wooden
building, were nearing 50. They were
approaching 200 in 1593, getting on rapidly
towards 500 in 1903, and by 1921 were over
2000 —electricians, engineers, plumbers, tin-
smiths, carpenters, builders, chemists,
designers, architects, sawmillers, boxmakers,
printers; all these besides the sweetsrmakers.
Organisation was the key to the big success,
although it had the so-called luck which
comes to enterprises that know how to seize
opportunities. The war, which practically
removed the competition of British and Con-
tinental manufacturers, made Australians a
present of the Australian market. They
seized it.
Macßobertson has never had a dispute
with his employees. The human element is
strong in his conduct of his works. He
knows most of the employees by their Chris-
tian names, and is fond of reminding them
that they are part of the concern. His life
is in the business, and he is on hand when
its day begins. His attendance means that
the heads are also present; and that makes
for efficiency. Like most men who have
made their own millions, he has the simplest
tastes; he has no hankering for things labelled
pleasure and regarded as desirable for the
rich merely because they are costly. Most
of them would be to him a mere waste of
time, and that is worse than a waste of
money. The money he makes goes back into
the industry, so that it is always expanding.
That is part of liis creed : he gives to
charity, but he believes that by putting money
into a new factory which will provide em-
ployment he does far more good than he
could do by giving the same amount to
charity. His attitude toward his employees
—an attitude which the majority of Aus-
tralian employers would like their own
to be, and which indeed is not so rare as
the talking delegate would like the public
to believe —is illustrated by one incident.
It had been necessary to discharge a highly-
placed employee; and Macßobertson con-
fided to a friend that he had been unable
to enjoy a meal for days. And he had not
actually discharged the man cither. “I told
Mm,” he said, “to take a fortnight’s holiday
on full pay, and during that time to see
whether he could discover any reason why
I should not sack him. I hope he may be
able to do so; but I’m afraid he won’t.”
Taken with the AVembley idea, Mac-
Robertson allocated £15,000 to make dis-
plays of his products in Britain. He neither
expected, nor even desired, to secure sales
there ; but he wanted to give Australian in-
dustry what advertisement he could ; and he
followed that up with his book to show that
Australia is still the Land of Opportunity,
no less in commerce than in public life.
There was probably in it a good deal of per-
sonal pride; and that pride is proper, and
still more proper when it is joined to pride
in the country where the great thing has
been done, and where, he insists, greater
things await the doing.
Already Australia has had many business
romances; the Macßobertson romance
ranks high not only among them but among
the business romances of the world. AVhy
should some of us, with the instance on
hand, be eternally quoting an American in-
dustrial exemplar? And why, above all,
should others of us tell the working man
without capital that in Australia, as in older
lauds, there can be for him nothing but
poverty all the days of his life?

Election Prospects in Queensland.
In Queensland “the Cause” is slipping.
Labor organisations can still be depended on
to poll their strength, in spite of continual
quarrels among themselves; but Labor has
lost its prestige with the unattached voter.
Concrete evidence of this was given at the
Greater Brisbane elections last February.
That battle was fought on the State elec-
toral rolls. Ten of the 20 Parliamentary
districts in the Greater Brisbane area are
represented by Labor members, yet the party
had a hard struggle to win six seats in the
council. Even at the last State elections
in 1023, when Labor was in far better odor
in Queensland than it is to-day, only the
gerrymandering of electoral boundaries saved
it from defeat. Aggregate votes polled were:
Labor . . . . 176,691
Anti-Labor .. 176,828
Independents .. 11,324
Informal .. 4,357
Total . . 369,200
One Labor man and three anti-Labor men
were returned unopposed, which means that
the anti-Labor majority would have been
larger had every seat been contested. Yet
on these figures Labor obtained a Parlia-
mentary majority of 14! Federal electoral
methods will make any such utterly dis-
honest result impossible. At the Senate elec-
tions in 1923 the Queensland aggregates
were:—
Labor 131,880
Anti-Labor .. .. 167,793
Anti-Labor majority .. 35,913
The Nationalists won all the Senate seats
and eight of the ten Representative seats.
Everything points to a large increase
in the anti-Labor vote; wherefore Labor’s
chance of winning even one Senate seat may
be written down as hopeless. Dr. Jensen,
ivho heads the Labor ticket, has indicated
what he thinks of his chance by going away,
in the middle of the campaign, to inspect
oilfields in Maoriland. Theodore may win
the Herbert seat, though he is finding it no
walkover,; a sympathetic vote for a physi-
cally crippled old-timer may enable Mc-
Donald to retain the Kennedy; Capricornia
is doubtful, but F. M. Forde has nursed the
electorate, and may manage to pull through.
Brisbane is the only other electorate in which
Labor has even a remote chance. Fihelly,
a fine mob-orator accustomed to easy vic-
tories, is there putting up the fight of his
career; but in Colonel Cameron lie meets
a man as popular as himself and with more
solid qualities, and compulsory voting will
fight on the non-Labor side as it did in the
Greater Brisbane contests. If, then, Labor
retains the two seats it holds at present
(Capricornia and Kennedy) and gains the
Herbert, it will do better than most of its
old-time friends think that it deserves to
do in these days of its degradation.
Micawber Reproaching His Creditors.
Like stone-broke pilgrims at a shrine, the
Australian Agents-General have almost lived
of late on the British Government’s door-
step begging that the embargo on new loans
shall be lifted. These, of course, mean new
money with which to keep the prodigal’s pot
a-boiling, as distinguished from the other
kind of loans which mean that a bill has
fallen due, as everyone knew it would, and,
there being nothing saved up to meet it, the
alternative to persuading the holder to renew
is bankruptcy. J. Bull always renews as
a matter of course, it being impossible, in
his own interests, to precipitate a debtor
who owes so much into the place where
debtors burst and creditors lose everything.
But he is more hard pressed himself than
he has been since lie made a disastrous
peace after the U.S. War of Independence,
and he evidently thought that his expensive
grown-up children might struggle along for
a while without adding fresh obligations to
stale ones. Possibly the importunity of the
Agent-General tribe has created the new
conviction in his worried old mind that
things have reached a pass with the family
at which even the failure to supply further
accommodation would be dangerous. So a
sort of promise has been given that the em-
bargo will be lifted whether the Old Man
can afford it or not. Unless reformation can
be brought about this is only postponing the
problem, for if it requires heavier borrowing
each year to keep the Australian ship afloat
a crisis must eventuate in time. Partly by
reason of his Freetrade incubus J. Bull is
oppressed with too many imports. It was
recently estimated that, after setting against
them the value of liis exports, the interest
income from foreign investments and the
earnings of his ships, he was £29,000,000
to the good for the year. If the war tribute
to the United States had still to be provided
for, it was obvious that there was a heavy
loss, and that the Old Man was living on his
capital, and selling the furniture to meet
his bills. When it is added that Australia’s
interest contribution isn’t cash at all but
only an additional I O U (that is what new
loans are for), and that the interest on. that
IOU will be another I O U, and that the
I 0 XT’s are quite unsaleable, Britain itself
being the only market, the situation is
pretty bad. It would' be bad even if all the
other interest which J. Bull had the luck
to collect was realisable value, and had no
I O U’s mixed up with it. In addition to
all else, a great number of British ships
ceased, since the above estimate was made,
to earn anything by reason of this country’s
pathetic inability or unwillingness to handle
Garden, Walsh and Co., and Chinese
strikers and revolutionaries have made a
melancholy hash of a once profitable coasting
trade further north. Thus it came about
that the Old Man lately found his stock of
gold diminishing in a serious fashion, and
would have liked (as the loan embargo indi-
cated) to get a bit of interest from these
parts in some more tangible form than
paper. One result of the attempt was that
N.S.W. ex-Premier Holman, on a visit to
London, struck the attitude of Micawber
reproaching his principal (almost his only)
creditor, and spoke bitter words in the Sun-
day Express ;
Australia is a new country, with vast possibilities
for perfectly legitimate investments of British capital.
but to-day it can get no British capital. Aus-
tralia already feels far too strong a gravitational
pull towards America.... if the rising generation
in Australia is taught that it is to America it
must look for the financial support essential to
the growth of the country, the effect on Australian
sentiment will be most serious.
The United States shows no burning desire
to do Australian State finance on a large
scale, but still the words read almost like a
threat to transfer future overdrafts there.
They almost read, too, like a rather discredit-
able hint that a continuation of cordiality
must be paid for.

The Australian Infant.
“Carysfort” : It is a peculiarly Australian
form of modesty that fails to recognise the
merits of its own sons and institutions and
insists upon unfavorable comparisons with
oversea visitors and agencies. Though
lacking a name ending in ndl, ski or ov, and
further handicapped by one of obviously
Anglo-Saxon origin, Dr. Truby King has
been accepted by press and public as an in-
spired prophet. He has done, and is still
doing, work of great value in the way of
educating mothers in the care of their babies,
and his gift of publicity is quite exceptional;
but, unlike Australians, he appears to pos-
sess an intensely, almost bigotedly, patriotic
belief in the merits of his own Dominion,
and he damns with bell and candle every-
thing Australian and all who do not blindly
follow his methods in every fetichistic de-
tail. Ilis methods are good; but many
others are as good, and some few are better.
As good, and in many respects better, methods
have been in use in Australia for many
years; and there is not an important point
in his teachings that has not been a matter
of common knowledge for many years. Even
his emulsion is similar to several used in
London years ago, which were designed on
grounds of economy for use in the slums.
The use of soap is a cheap way of making
the emulsion, and is harmless, but there
exist many substitutes for human milk with-
out soap and superior in other respects to
the emulsion which we are being scolded
for not importing. (Mark the insistence on
importation of an article which can be
cheaply and easily made here.) False deduc-
tions have been drawn from published tales
of infantile mortality. The percentage of
deaths under one year of the total births
is lower in Maoriland than anywhere'else in
the world; but so it was 20 years ago.
In 1006 the rate for M.L. was 62 against 86
f.or Australia. The present rates are 46 for
M.L. and 63 for Australia. Thus we have
made at least as great proportionate progress
as have they, and our organisation and
scientific methods do not appear to be as
stupid as Dr. Truby King would have us
believe. As a matter of fact, our figures
trmpare favorably with those of the rest
of the world. The wonderful figures of
M.L. arc due to its special conditions of
healthy climate, relative absence of flies,
small towns, and in sharing with us in a
very high standard of living among the work-
ing classes. In support of this argument it
may be mentioned that the average death-
rate for all ages from 1905-14 was 9.3 for
M.L. against 10.8 here. Let us, for once,
overcome modesty and realise. while
M.L. possesses climatic and social advan-
tages which have always given it a more
favorable mortality rate, both infantile and
adult, and while it has such a peerless pub-
licist and advertiser of his errantry in Dr.
Truby King, that we have improved
our infantile mortality more rapidly than
M.L., and that we possess experts in
Public Health whose work and merits
are better known and appreciated in
Europe than are Dr. Truby King’s,
specialists in diseases of children of at
least equal standing to any in M.L., and
nurses who were recognised as the best-
trained among the Allies, and who have had
a far more complete training than the short-
course _ Plunket nurses. There are many
faults in our methods and organisation, and
room for much improvement in our know-
ledge ; but it is certain that we have more
to teach than to learn from Dr. Truby'
King and from M.L., and we will only lose
by accepting without protest their attempts
to discredit our experts and their ridiculous
scolding for not following their system to
its last unimportant detail.

Dutch New Guinea.
Tiie Consul-General of the Netherlands
writes:—
Dutch New Guinea lias been discovered 1 >v
“Gregor” (B. 22/10/’25) to be a perpetual menace
to Australia. But the reasons on which his (isolated)
opinion is apparently based do not bear examination.
In the statement that during the 80-odd years (to
be exact, 98 years) we have done nothing in the
way of exploration or exploitation “Gregor” is very
wide of the facts. He shows that he is entirely
unaware of the systematic and thorough exploration
in North, West and South New Guinea since 1906,
when under the orders of that great Governor-
General, General van Heutsz, nobody less than
Captain H. Colyn (who is now Prime Minister of
Holland) was commissioned to advise on the econo-
mic development of certain possessions, amongst
which was our part of New Guinea. So much for
our exploration. As for our exploitation, I would
like to say that the area under cocoanuts is steadily
being increased, and the export of copra is supple-
mented by the plumes of the bird of paradise, a
very important and profitable trade. We have shot
those birds on certain islands for 300 years and
with proper restrictions and safeguards they are as
plentiful now as when we came there first.
The area of Dutch New Guinea is 397,204 square
k.m., the development of which is indeed a great
task ahead of the Hollanders, especially taking into
consideration the inhospitable nature of the coun-
try, the enormous swamps full of fever, the wild and
inaccessible mountains, and the warlike natives.
Britishers, who generally do not mind difficulties,
call our part of the south coast “the Devil’s own
country.” However, big as the task is, when a
nation has a record like the Dutch in the East,
when they show results such as have actually been
achieved in Java (as large as the State of New
York), in Sumatra (as large as California), in
Dutch Borneo (as large as France), in the Celebes
(as large as Maoriland and Ceylon), and in the
Moluccas, the development of a territory like Dutch
New Guinea, which is only as large as Japan, is
well within the bounds of. possibility.
Of course anybody willing to help is welcomed
by us. We preach and practise the open-door policy,
and our settlers will not hesitate to employ colored
labor. With all due appreciation of the White Aus-
tralia policy, common sense forbids me to believe
that “Gregor” is serious when he thinks of the
development of this particular essentially tropical
territory with white labor.

In the Oldest City.
The calamity of Damascus, where French
shells have been tearing to pieces streets that
held a curious interest for Christian and
Mahommedan alike, is strangely stirring the
world. Not even Jerusalem itself pulls (pnte
so strongly at the heart-strings of memory
as the aged capital of Syria. The city,
famed in that part of history which seems
almost recent for its blades of steel inlaid
with gold and its glowing and scented roses,
has often in the ages gone by been drawn
into the vortex of war. Crusaders reached
its walls, bilt did not storm them ; tlie hosts
of Islam took the place from the hands ot
its feeble Greek holders; Rome liad a pro-
vincial Governor there, and made the colon-
naded “street which is called straight,” over
which the thoroughfare recently ruined by
French shellfire kept the original line;
Alexander included it among liis conquests:
Nineveh and Babylon in turn laid the heaA'.v
imperial hand on it; Beniladad led his
troops from its gates to battle with the
armies of northern Israel; and fugitives from
hard-fought fields came flying to its shelter
breathing the terrible name of the victorious
Ahab. Many centuries earlier than that it
had already become a great city, the north-
ern capital of the hosts of Siiem who gath-
ered in from the southern deserts on the
skirts of the decaying Hittite power.
Abraham found liis steward in the place at
some very remote date; and its position gives
probability to the Arab tradition that it was
old even then —in fact as well as fancy
the oldest city in the world. There is a
reasonable possibility that the ruins of
Thebes in Egypt, representing a city 3000
years dead, are no older than the other rem-
nants of early civilisation which lie Under
the houses of living Damascus. Many rulers
belonging to many races have held sway
there; it has known the full weight of Orien-
tal despotism and capricious autocratic rule ;
but there is no tradition that it ever wit-
nessed a spectacle like that of the exposure
of mangled corpses with which the French
authorities sought to strike terror into the
hearts of the people. The people slain were,
of course, described as brigands; but bri-
gand is a loose term on the fringe of
the desert of Syria. Robbery with violence
is a very old and respectable trade which
recently had the full patronage of tlie, Turk
ish Government; and though the brigand
who was ready to slay was always open to
the chance of being slain, the dishonoring
of his corpse is quite another matter. The
Arab ethics in connection with these matters
are hard to understand, As late as 1868
the Turkish military escort to an English
party of explorers robbed every traveller met
between Damascus and Palmyra, yet re-
mained xierfectly faithful to its trust as far
as the explorers were concerned. Remon-
strated with, the Turkish leader —himself a
Syrian—declared that it would be impious
to refuse anything Allah had put into their
hands. The brigands whose corpses were
recently exposed were probably thoroughly
religious persons whose piety was known in
every mosque in the city. So tlie French
blunder of trying to strike terror by tlie
use of hideous barbarism may have cut very
deep into the Syrian mind. On tlie other
hand, those very brigands were capable of
intense gratitude for real favors; so there
was clearly a better road open to the autho-
rities of the mandated Syrian territory.
The Übiquitous Tin.
“Poinciana” : One of the British Press
visitors, when asked his opinion about the
scenery of the N.S.W. Northern Rivers,
made some facetious remark about the
amount of tin that decorated the landscape.
Not in the form of crude ore, or even as
roofing for the houses, but in the rusty, mis-
cellaneous assortments that catch the travel-
ler’s eye wherever he turns. He had counted
30 kinds, from the humble cover for
cut tobacco to the one the motorist aban-
dons when lie lias filled his tank. Probably
if he had rummaged on the heaps that lie
outside most of our townships he would
have discovered more. As a people we have
a confirmed habit of using things in tins and
then strewing the empties about as orna-
ments. The further one goes into the
regions where cur national characteristics
are more pronounced, the larger become tlie
heaps of tins outside the back doors. The kero-
sene-tin has there become the one absolute
necessity in the kitchen, as well as a national
standard of measurement. "A kerosene-
tin full of cakes,” I heard one woman say,
when describing what had been left over
from some local carouse. She probably used
the utensils originally designed for holding
Standard oil in a dozen different forms,
cutting them into dustpans or condemning
them to hold slops for the pigs. And that is
understandable enough: they happen to be
handy and pliable, besides coming into the
house in the first place in company with a
necessary commodity. It is the faith in the
food-value of things that come out of tins
that is so obscure and hard to comprehend.
Lately, in a remote seaside-place where good,
fresh oysters are procurable at sixpence a
dozen, I was astonished to come upon rows
of the tinned variety at the local store.
Oysters that had felt the wash of the nobler,
purer seas that lave the docks of Baltimore
(U.S.A.), and so were superior to the stay-
at-home variety on the rocks three hundred
yards away! In the same district pine-
apples were produced lavishly enough to be
a drug on the market, yet the storekeeper
was busy selling tinned ones to the local
residents. Fish —but why labor the point?
The same tiling is going on all over Aus-
tralia. There must be some prejudice
against fresh food that has gone deep into
our blood. An oyster or a pineapple that
lias never been mellowed by confinement in a
tin has something raw and primitive about
it that revolts our epicurean tastes! In this
we differ greatly from tlie French who, in
spite of their reputation for. cookery, have
never discovered the kick lent to food by so-

they have to offer it to a guest in any form.
But perhaps it is not entirely our epicurean
tastes that draw us towards tins —perhaps
it is the decorative quality of the things
themselves. We do not export them in any
quantity, even when we have plenty of sur-
plus food to fill them. Instead we collect
them from all the corners of the earth, fill
our houses with them, and afterwards arrange
them in little heaps outside as signs of our
civilisation. No wonder that visitors are
puzzled by this obscure passion of ours!
The historians of the future, burrowing
among our rubbish-lieaps, will probably de-
vote weighty volumes to an exposition of it.
They will reveal us as a people who wor-
shipped tin gods, and were finally destroyed

At Gladstone, Bowen and Cairns.
What firmness in a good cause cau achieve,
even in a State with a coldt'ooted Labor
Government, has been illustrated at Glad-
stone (Q.). A “black” steamer’s cargo of
foodstuffs being in danger of perishing owing
to the British seamen’s strike committee and
its local friends interdicting the delivery of
coal to keep the refrigerating plant going,
the farmers and graziers of the district sent
word that if coal wasn’t on board by a cer-
tain time they would put it there themselves
There were hurried conferences between re-
presentatives of the Government and the
strikers, dark threats as to what would
happen to the producers if they dared to
protect their own property, and fierce ex-
pressions of the hope that all cargoes held
up in “strike” ships would rot; but the
coal was duly supplied. And not by the
farmers and graziers, although they made it
abundantly clear that they would have been
ready if wanted. Fortified by the Gladstone
example, a large number of canegrowers
arrived at Bowen, and another body, rein-
forced by timber-getters from the Atherton
Tableland, descended bn Cairns, in each case
to see that ships were loaded with produce
which has been accumulating on the wharves.
Owing chiefly to a lawless attempt to en-
force the rotary system on the waterfront,
the trade of those ports has been strangled
for many weeks. As a result, the sugar
industry has been paralysed at what should
he the busiest part of the season, and
although the Labor Government encouraged
farmers to settle in the Inkerman district,
on which there has been a vast expenditure
of loan money, it has shown the yellow
streak, as usual, and let the wreckers work
their will. It is deplorable that farmers
should have to leave their farms and run
the risk of a struggle with a waterside mob
in order to save their produce. But when
Labor Governments offer no resistance to
the arrogant claim that a handful of union-
ists with a preference award have a right
at any time, for communist or other criminal
reasons, to refuse to do essential work or let
it be done—even if cargoes rot, districts are
ruined and industries destroyed in the pro-
cess—men who have not lost their manhood
can adopt no other course.

Queensland Premier McCormack’s new
Cruelty to Animals Bill forbids interference
with homing pigeons, but says nothing about
pigeon-slaughter in trap-shooting competi-
tions. It makes the employer liable for
cruelty by an employee using a horse unfit
to work; 'which is good, and may be more
effective in preventing cruelty than fining
the driver. But there is one glaring form
of cruelty to which the Government is a
party. That is the carrying of stock from
the Phir West to Brisbane for slaughter. Fat
cattle and sheep are brought by rail from
Longreach, a journey of 900 miles, to Bris-
bane. , They are frequently more than a
week oil the trip, and sometimes the regula-
tion three stops for food and water are not
made. The last 400 miles of the journey,
Rockhampton to Brisbane, is made along
the coast past the good port of Gladstone.
The system is wasteful, because the animals
Jose weight on the journey, excessive bruis-
ing takes place owing to the beasts’ struggle
to reach the most comfortable positions in
the trucks and the horning that occurs
damages the hides. There is considerable
wastage, too, by reason of animals having to
be taken from the trucks at wayside stations
with broken legs or because of other in-
juries or just plain exhaustion. The remedy
is killing in the centres where the cattle
and sheep are grown, and the provision of
refrigerator trucks to carry the carcases to
the nearest port—which is not Brisbane.
Bince more carcases can be carried than live
bullocks in the trucks, it would mean a
saving in rolling-stock, and the truck scar-
city is a big problem on the Queensland rail-
ways. The Federal Government might have
insisted upon a more economical method of
handling meat for export when it was pay-
ing a bonus for beef, but it did not, and so
a chance of bringing about decentralisation
by transferring meat-industry employees from
the big city to the more or less vacant West
was lost.
“Bilbao" : I have an idea that the Sydney
and suburban home shortage about which
there is so much verbal outpouring, how-
ever bad it may have been once, is in danger
now of becoming a superstition. In a recent
issue of a Sydney paper appeared 20 columns
of advertisements, re houses and land for
sale; seven columns of houses to let; five
of flats to let; six of apartments, with board,
or partial board, or optional board, or no
board; six of hotels and holiday resorts,
some of them within tram-ride of the city;
and 174 columns of real-estate auction sales.
The metropolis has its troubles —among
them that two-tliirds of the State’s new
population settles there for lack of another
rising coastal city to go to; that three-
fourths of the State's manufacturing popu-
lation has been diverted there; and that in-
dustrial population, with its belongings, tries
to huddle into nine municipalities out of the
60 included in the County of Cumberland, so
as to be, near the huddled factories. There
is lack of bridges, wide roads, suburban rail-
ways (tube or plain), and quick transit to
make the moderately remote suburbs avail-
able for residence. And then the builders,
who are largely responsible for the 20
columns of houses and land for sale, won’t
consider letting propositions, which would
bring them within reach of the Fair Rents
Court and the contumely thereof. Accom-
modation seems to exist, but to be bottled
up by muddlers and tightly corked by fools.
“Phthisis” : If those consumptives who are
worrying themselves so about the Spah-
linger treatment had been ill as long as I
have they would not be so credulous and
impatient. The assertion that two men went to
Spahlinger and were cured proves nothing.

of labor drove to motor-shepherding. He
had had 150 acres in good cow-country, a
cream cheque of £l7O per month, a profit
of £7 or £8 per week. Content? Well, yes.
But ho lost his labor, and was unable to
get more, and had only his wife to help him,
for his family was not grown up enough to
milk yet. No matter! As a motor-service
man he has earned as much as £lOO a month.

are provided for unregistered persons who
make use of titles which may suggest that
they are registered. One clause declares
that the Board may refuse registration
to any person holding qualifications
from a country where British medical prac-
titioners are not admitted to practise.. This
clause is regarded locally as aimed at an
Abrams practitioner who is qualified in his
native country (Holland), which does not
recognise British medical degrees. The un-
registered men are quaking-—they expect
that the Medical Board, as soon as it has
raised sufficient funds by the levy, will start
a pogrom against them.

“Sixenate" : The trouble started when a
man at Mareeba (Q.) contracted to sell his
farm to a Mrs. Wright, collected £250 der
posit, and disappeared. Then Mrs. Wright
learnt that the farm wasn't his: it belonged
to his wife, who, however, as an act of
grace, agreed to honor the contract, accept-
ing the balance of purchase money in settle-
ment. But when Mrs. Wright pointed to
a fencing proviso in the agreement for sale,
the lady jibbed, and was sued for £5O on
that account. A verdict of £4O was given,
and upset on appeal to a Supreme Court
Judge, which decision was again upset by
the Full Court; and now Knox, C. J., has
been moved to some remarks about the absur-
dity of troubling the High Court with such
a “twopenny appeal.” Justice Starke also
expressed himself as reluctant to allow the
parties to ruin themselves; and the right
to appeal was refused. Probably the costs
already represent several times the amount
in dispute. Extravagant litigation of this
sort might be prevented if the Law restricted
chargeable costs to the amount involved in
any dispute ; as long as there is no restric-
tion clients will not only beggar themselves,
hut cumber the higher courts, which means
great expense to the country and the delay
of legitimate business.

“Vector”: If Francis Jackson (B.
l/10/’25) erred in his observations on the
travelling conditions on Commonwealth ships
it was on the side of moderation. I have
this year travelled to England by the line,
and my experience was that the stewards
disregarded both cleanliness and civility.
There were over 90 of them aboard, about a
dozen only being Australians. The cutlery
had to be cleaned by the passengers at the
table, and the cloth at every meal showed
that the knives were far from clean before
being rubbed on it. There was much studied
rudeness to the women passengers; the cheap
witticisms fired off at them when humbly
waiting for hot water to make early-morning
tea were mostly Cockney in accent and senti-
ment. There was very little sea-sickness,
which was fortunate, for the women got no
attention. The bread and butter were good,
and so was the meat generally, but the fruit
was refuse —it was in striking contrast to
the tempting-looking samples on tables
occupied by the ship’s company. Most of
those who went “home” in the ship aband-
oned any intention of returning by the same
line. All arrangements seemed to be made
for the comfort of those who work the ship
rather than of the passengers, 1 retain a
vivid remembrance of the displeasure of the
stewards when a number of passengers of
both sexes humbly awaited hot water to make
tea in the morning. They were smartly told
there was none, and this by attendants who
were drinking the beverage themselves.
“Retsam” : “Arautjn” handles a poor case
plausibly (B. 22/10/’25). A very small per-
centage of the cattle of N. S. Wales are ex-
hibited at the R.A. Show, and these are stud,
not herd, cattle. It is more fitting to judge
the poor class of cattle in the State by those
sold at Flemitigton. The State is indirectly
to blame. It should impose a stiff tax —say
£2 per head per annum- —on all bulls; then
the cookies would be encouraged to discard
mongrels. The S.M.F. Co., Aberdeen works,
etc., are not charged by the Newcastle Board
or the Sydney Board for stock killed for ex-
port. They can kill unlimited quantities,
whereas at the Sydney Abattoirs. Homebush
Bay. owing to lack of facilities the carcase
butchers are unable to kill cattle for export.
The reasons for the falling off in export are
contained in my par. (B. 24/9/’25). But
for local consumption the Metropolitan Meat
Industry Board should follow Newcastle’s
example and charge the S.M.P. Co. an im-
port fax. For “Aeagun's” information, the
Hunter Hirer works at Leichhardt have been
taken over by Edible Products, Ltd., mar-
garine manufacturers, and are paying. Tiboo-
renu had three fires lately, the last about
eight months ago—that’s why they are
closed. And the Gladstone works are shut
down owing to the shipping strike. How
“Aragun” comes to blame the State for this
beats me.
+
“W.li.”: The success of the Ab locomotive
on the Maoriland railways seems likely to
be equalled by that of the C 36 engine of
N. S. Wales. In M.L. the A locomotive was
the pioneer from which the Ab was evolved ;
in N. S. Wales NN was the experiment and
C 36 the finished product—both were designed
by E. E. Lucy, Chief Mechanical Engineer.
The central idea was to have a locomotive
which would be able to run from Sydney to
Albrry without having to go to the engine-
shed for coal. Until the C 36 arrived three
engines ran the Melbourne trains on the
different beats on the 400-mile run, and each
engine had a separate crew. The C36does
it in one hit, with the same crew. For a
coal-burning engine the achievement is almost
a record. Oil-burners in the U.S.A. run on
beats up to over SOO miles, but oil can be
carried in less space than coal. The possi-
bilities opened up by the advent of the C 36
engine are enormous. Before long Broken
Hill will be connected with the N.S.W. rail-
way system, and some day, I suppose, there
will be a direct line to Darwin. Then will
an engine which can run for 000 miles with-
out losing its breath, so to speak, be worth
its weight in gold. Sixty C3G’s are being
built, the largest engine-order put in hand
for many a year. Weighing 159 tons and
working at a pressure of 1801 b., they can
carry 6300 gallons of water and 14 tons of
coal. So far the longest non-stop effort has
been 100 miles, but that can be improved on.
if necessary. The main thing is to avoid
changing engines; and this will be achieved
with the C 36 type.

POLITICAL
POINTS
What may happen in Australia if the
Federal Labor party gets control of the army
and 'makes it class-conscious —the idea is
to let the volunteer retain his service rifle
and ammunition—was pointedly suggested by
Monday’s occurrences in Westralia and
North Queensland. The W estralian Cock-
tail Cabinet, having expressed a maudlin
sympathy with the striking British mariners
and given the communist bosses of the Aus-
tralian Seamen’s Union all the rope . they
needed, reversed its policy in a panic on
discovering- that British shipowners had cut
out Fremantle and that the State had lost
its extensive timber trade with the S’African
Government, one of whose chartered steam-
ers has been wantonly held up at Bunbury
for months. In the result there was a clash
between a mob of British strikers, led by
local communists and armed With “waddies,
hammers, iron bars and long bolts,” and the
police, the latter being victorious after a
number of men had been hurt on each side.
At Cairns (N.Q.), where trade had been
at a standstill for weeks, a resolute body
of farmers and timber-getters drove away the
communists of the Lumpers’ Union who (a
scared Labor Government acquiescing) were
forcibly preventing the majority from re-
turning to work. In this case, there were
no casualties to speak of. But if volunteers
of the right color are going to be armed,
there will be a different tale to tell.
The tender solicitude of Walsh, Johanson
and co. for the British seamen is a plant
of recent growth. In 1922 a crew was en-
gaged in Britain for the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment steamer Largs Bay, which had just
been delivered by the shipbuilders. Dream-
ing of steady jobs at Australian rates of
pay, the Britons brought the vessel to Syd-
ney. There the usual walking delegate
brusquely ordered them to clear out, as the
ship belonged to the Australian Seamen’s
Union, which would supply a crew of its
own on the job-control principle; and out
they had to clear.
A current allegation is that “if there is
one party above any other which has con-
sistently pleaded for a White Australia it
is the Labor party.” Yet the fact remains
that the so-called Labor party is champion-
ing Walsh and Johanson, who have carried
on a long campaign against Australian (and
British) shipping enterprises employing
white labor, to the immense profit of foreign
companies employing cheap colored labor —
their boats are never interfered with. The
same party has admitted Walsh to member-
ship and the privilege of helping to shape
its policy, notwithstanding his repeated
sneers at the White Australia policy _ and his
express declaration that “the Australian Sea-
men’s Union raises no national or racial
barriers against a man working in this or
any other country, and will not stand for
race exclusion.” Walsh was a delegate to
the Vic. Labor Conference six months ago.
When British kings of the Stuart pattern
were still struggling for absolute power it was
the custom for the monarch not only to
appoint judges but to remove them at his
pleasure if the sentences they passed didn’t
give him satisfaction. Some Labor Govern-
ments have a craving to get back to the old
way, their ideas about human liberty being
crude. In the N.S.W. Industrial Arbitra-
tion Amendment Act this tendency is con-
spicuous. For instance
Clause 3 sacks the existing judges of the Arbitra-
tion Court.
Clause 6 provides that the Industrial Commissioner
who is to preside over the new court shall be a
man of legal training, but removable at “the pleasure
of the Governor,” which is presumably the Ministry.
His salary is not fixed.
The other members of the court shall be appointed
by the Minister, and shall receive “such fares and
out-of-pocket expenses as are approved of by the
Minister.”
When even the leaders of parties opposed to
the Government are gagged in Parliament,
there isn’t much blessed liberty left.
The Council of the N.S.W. Chamber of
Manufactures has condemned “any change
in the method of selecting and appointing
State Governors.” It is an ass of a
method. The Government of Britain swings
now between Labor and the. other thing;
and before we know it some wild man from
THE CHAMPION OF FREE SPEECH.
“In the N.S.W. Assembly last week the Government pushed a bill through to restore all the privi-
leges of the 1917 Railway strikers and degrade those loyalists who had won promotion. Even Mr.
Bruxner, leader of the Country party, was precluded from discussing the measure.”
LITTLE AUSTRALIAN: “You arc still all for free speech, Mr. Lang?"
MR. LANG : “Of course I am—as long as they speak what I want ’em lo."
the Clydeside may be unloaded on us. The
more unbearable he may be to the Labor
Ministry, the better his chance may be of
a job in Australia. And in between times
we may have Johanson or Donald Grant
as Deputy-Governor. It may be a “method,”
but it certainly isn't methodical.
Queensland politicians earn their £5OO a
year easily. This year’s Parliament began
its work on July 28 and finished on October
27, sitting three days a week; and that is
by no means exceptional for Queensland.
Nominally, the House stands adjourned to
November 17, but the Premier (his name is
disremembered for the moment) says it is
unlikely that there will be any more legis-
lative business until after the elections in
May or June. Three Premiers have held
office this year, and the Opposition leader
drily suggested that the haste in adjourning
was caused by the fear of a fourth Premier
coming to light.
“Notsellor”: N.S.W. Labor Premier Lang
hasn’t yet put into force the orders of
Caucus to swamp the Leg. Council. Appa-
rently he is waiting until some policy-speech
legislation is thrown out by the Council.
But the Governor will have no more right
to make appointments at that time than he
has now if the object of the appointments
is the abolition of the Council. The Con-
stitution states that N. S. Wales shall be
governed by a Council and an Assembly.
Appointments to the Council should there-
fore only be made for the purpose of govern-
ing. Self-abolition is not an act of gov-
ernment. The Governor would, therefore,
be justified in requiring a written under-
taking from every appointee that lie is not
becoming a member of the Council in order
to secure its abolition without a referendum.
Even a Labor Government could hardly
make a poorer showing than the Allan-
Peacock administration, which wants
£300,000 more revenue to meet the expenses
it promised to curtail. The Vic. State Budget
this year' is £24,727,710, which is twice the
amount required seven years ago, when war-
time' expenditure was the excuse for calls
upon the purse of the taxpayer. Two years
ago the income-tax was £1,837.564, and is
now to be £2,076,000 (£775.950 was suffi-
cient seven years ago) ; yet, in spite of the
extra demands for direct taxation, the State
debt has increased in a year from
£124,108,326 to £131,169,565. And the irri-
tation is all the greater because the futile
Government has precious little to show in the
way of legislation. The State’s politics have
got into a deplorable backwater.
A union boss at Gladstone (Q.) the other
day “solemnly” warned the district graziers
and farmers going on to any vessels
to keep the refrigerating plants running in
order to save their own perishables. If
they went he wouldn't, lie said, be answer-
able for the consequences. Gentlemen who
light fires which threaten to get out of hand
often talk like that. Of course, it is unmiti-
gated rubbish; they are answerable for the
consequences. Bill Sikes can't escape prison
by the simple process of announcing at large
that, if anybody keeps money in the house,
he won’t be answerable if he breaks in and
steals it.
In an effort to prop up his party's droop-
ing tail, Carey, secretary of the N. S. Wales
A.L.P., asserted that “Elliot Johnson nar-
rowly averted defeat for Lang at the last
election.” As a matter of fact, Johnson
beat George Francis Xavier Smith, his oppo-
nent then as now, by 11,911 votes to 9906.
Lang, plus bits of Parkes and Dailey, con-
stitutes the State electorate of St. George,
which in 1922 and 1925 elected two Labor
members (the present Attorney-General Mc :
Tiernan and Colonial Sec. Lazzarini) out
ol’ five; on May 30 Carey's party got no
more than 20,458 first preferences out of
49,914. At least a fifth of the Federal
Labor members would like to feel as safe
as Johnson looks. His 1945 majority is a
lot more comfortable than Cunningham’s 87
in Gwydir, O’Keefe’s 91 in Denison, Mc-
Grath’s 224 in Ballarat, McNeill’s 407 in
Wannon, Yates’s 719 in Adelaide, Moloney’s
1360 in Hume or H. P. Lazzarini’s 1431 in
Werriwa.
The Lang Government proposes to divide
N. S. Wales into 90 single electorates again,
with due regard, it is assumed, for gerry-
mandering principles, and go back to the
simple old electoral ways—with one excep-
tion. The disgraceful and undemocratic
freak of filling casual vacancies by nomina-
tion instead of by-election has served the
party well, and is to be continued.
The British way of doing things has a re-
freshing promptness about it. The other
day 12 Communists, being a selection out of
the stock on hand, were brought up at Bow-
street police court, London. A big legal gun
fired for the prosecution :
Accused were being prosecuted as the leaders and
principal executive officers of two illegal organisa-
tions. the Communist Party of Great Britain and
the Young Communist League, which received orders
from Moscow. The view of the prosecution was
that all persons disseminating the doctrines of
Communism were liable to prosecution for sedition.
Communism was illegal, because i it involved the
forcible overthrow of the Government, the creation
of class war, and the seduction of the armed forces
of the Crown from their oath of allegiance.
During the proceedings a fool outside the
court started waving a red flag and resisted
arrest, but being fined £5 or a month his
emblem vanished for the day.
The Allan-Peacock Ministry (Vie.) -has
introduced a Pharmaceutical Chemists Bill,
with a view to giving the more atrocious
kind of medical impostor something to go
on with. The Chief Secretary said 37
Europeans and 68 niggers, with no special
qualification except their brazen effrontery,
practised in his little State, and some of
them had branches outside. The more pre-
tentious went on tour per motor-car, and
sometimes took £l5O in one small town.
Among other things it was stated that the
object of the bill was' to remedy a flaw 7 in
the Pharmacy Act of 1.876 which had been
perpetuated in the Medical Act of 1890.
That doesn't look like haste. After a languid
debate Labor-leader Prendergast got the
matter adjourned for a week. That doesn’t
look like haste either. '
By exercising tact and more than a little
forbearance. Vic. Treasurer Peacock piloted
the State Employees' Superannuation Bill
through the Assembly. When the measure
is law there will be less reason to fear strikes
in the Railway Department (although loss
of pensions did not deter some hotheads in
1903, when there was a loco, hold-up for a
week), and it should be possible to retain
in the public service more of the brainy
young fellows. In recent years private em-
ployers have snai’ed from the Yic. service
too many of its first-raters.

British Empire was doomed and that nothing could

“Mr. Garden, secretary of the T. and L. Council,

GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If the men who stand firmly for the Government
when the majority of their fellow workers strike
against it are penalised after an indefinite number of
years for their good faith, how is Government enter-
prise to be conducted?”
When Government ice-cream-chocolate-beer
Began to be made at Balmain,
A strikemonger captured the factory's ear
And a strike was conducted in vain :
But for nineteen days in the summer heat,
Though they called him a scab and a fool,
The liftman loyally sat on his seat
With the levers ready to pull.
There were columns of praise in the public press
For the man who stuck to his job ;
And they called him a hero, more or less,
And raised his wages a bob.
But the strike broke down and the Ministry changed
And the favor seemed to drift;
For the new Government’s fancy was quite estranged
From the man who drove the lift.
' They kicked him out by a special bill
And doubled the strikers’ pay;
> But the votes at the next poll chanced to spill
[ A trifle the opposite way.
- The parties changed and the liftman came
; Again to his place of pride;
i And those who had struck had an hour of shame
, And another long turn outside.
j So the ice-cream-chocolate-beer ran dry
And wet in this breezy play;
For the liftman’s job was a party cry
And no party came to stay,
i But in and out and around about,
Like cats, men chased their tails ;
t And getting the sack and being put hack
l Was the game in New South Wales !

While that £”>76,143 has been piling up,
£525,000 has been paid out iu dividends ; so
the co., besides paying for new plant and
development work, made £901,143 during
the year. The Wild Cat can’t say that that
w-as profit; no doubt something ought to be
deducted from it to cover mine-wastage—the
424,710 tons ore that has been taken out
can never be taken out again ; it is capital
used up. As against that it is possible that
concentrates on hand and in course of reali-
sation (£611,391) have been undervalued.
They are not likely to have been overvalued;
for as at June 30 lead was worth £33 3s. 9d.
and zinc £34 55., whereas at the end of
October lead was worth £3S 2s. 6d. and zinc
£39 155., and both had been higher.
The net liquid assets shown above were
£1,525,713. There are 700,000 shares; so
these assets alone mean 435. 6d. per share,
and that is assuming that the concentrates
produced and not paid for were worth only
what the accounts claim. Certainly some
of the assets called liquid would not be very
saleable if disaster fell upon this co. and the
lead-zinc mining industry. Of the total of
£1,792,613 of liquid assets, £427,945 is repre-
sented by shares at cost. In this are in-
cluded a £230,000 interest in Associated
Smelters —the concern formed at the begin-
ning of the war to take over the 8.11.
Prop.’s Port l’irie works—and £150,000 in
Electrolytic Zinc. The latter holding at pre-
sent market price is worth about £240,600.
Most of the other investments are compara-
tively small, and were made to establish or
assist subsidiary industries. Thus a further
£13,500 was lent on debenture last year to
British Australian Lead Manufacturers,
Ltd., to establish a paint and varnish works
at Cabarita, outside Sydney. The share
holdings may be passed as, in the bulk, well
worth their book-value; and the other liquid
assets are almost as good as assets can be.
In addition to this 435. 6d. per share of
net liquid assets there are 4,000,000 tons of
measurable ore. Last year the profit per
ton of ore treated was just under 43s.—that
includes the profit from all sources. It isn’t
ii fair thing perhaps to suggest that the
4.000,000 tons are going to average the same
amount. If they average one-quarter of it
there is £2,150,000 there —just over £3 per
share. But all that is pure speculation. The
lead concentrates assayed 63.9 p.c. lead.
Take them at 60 p.c.; that means 46,437
tons lead. A fall of 30s. for lead extended
over a year thus means enough to wipe out
a 2s. dividend. What lead is going to be
worth in the future this paper does not
know. It has very vivid recollections of
lead at under £lO per ton. The course of
both the lead and spelter (zinc) markets of
late years has passed all understanding.
There is no clue to the future. All that
can be said is that there is nothing in the
statistics to suggest a sudden collapse.
Further, the rise in prices is not so much
out of harmony with the general rise in
prices as we sometimes seem to think. For
instance, during the four years 1911-14 Lon-
don price of zinc averaged £23 155., so,
taking the figure abovementioned, there has
been a rise of 67 p.c. there. Now, the aver-
age price level for the past three years of
all Australian exports was 2070 (taking the
level of 1901 as 1000) as against 1920 in
1913 ; so that the average rise of Australian
exports in the period was 61 p.c.—only 6
p.c. less than the rise in zinc.
Broken Hill has yielded no greater sur-
prise than the development of this mine. It
was one of the earliest worked; Zebina Lane
was its manager, and its future seemed so
hopeless that lie went to Westralia, made a
lucky stroke at Kalgoorlic, and (his old
Broken Hill show was just as nearly aband-
oned as any Broken Hill show could be. Hal
Sheppard got it for the co. of which the pre-
sent co. is the lineal descendant for £20.000
—and it is pretty safe to say that it made
that much profit last week. The 1550 ft.
level (North mine) has been opened up dur-
ing the year. The main crosscut here showed
ore 191 ft. wide. The average value was
15.3 p.c. lead, 9oz. silver and 12.6 p.c. zinc.
The ore milled during the year averaged 14
p.c. lead. 7.90 z. silver and 11.3 p.c. zinc.
The 191 ft. width is probably well in excess
of the mean ; but it looks as though there is
well over a million tons of ore here worth
16 p.c. lead, and that is 2 p.c. better than
the average for the mine sent to the mill
last year. A 1700 ft, level has been started
(the North shaft is below that), but the
lode has not been explored there yet. How-
ever, there is 10 years’ work already certain
at the recent rate of extraction, and the
bulk of it seems to be of higher grade than
the ore from which the recent profits have
been made. Whether, even so, it will all pay
to extract, and what it will pay, depends on
the markets.

A year ago the co. showed an “aggregate
net profit” of £36 039: but that was only
made possible by crediting itself with
£lOO.OOO alleged to have been added to the
value of the goodwill. No doubt there had
been a large goodwill increment; but good-
will in a newspaper won’t stay put, and is
far too uncertain and shadowy an asset
to be included in this Column’s calculations.
This year no addition has been made to the
froth; and there is no visible reason why
the £15,357 of profit claimed by the accounts
should not be the genuine article. That
being so, the improvement shown in the 12
months is quite remarkable. “The net re-
venue derived from advertising in the Daily
Guardian,” the directors say, “lias in-
creased by over 62 per cent., and the revenue
from sales has steadily advanced. Smith’s
Weekly revenue has also considerably in-
creased.” For the previous period (14
months) the results (apart from any con-
sideration of goodwill) was— Guardian loss,
£101,378; Smith’s Weekly profit, £36,141:
sundry earnings, £1276. Earnings for this
year are not itemised ; but it looks as if the
Guardian has reduced its las|si from
£101,378 to something in the neighborhood
of £20,000. And if the reported increase
in revenue has been progressive, it looks
further as if the venture must now be at
least paying its way. A good deal depends
on whether proper allowances have been
made against depreciation. As to this all
that can be said is that, whereas “plant,
machinery, fixtures, fittings and furniture”
stood in the accounts at £66.601 in 1924,
they are now down to £62,782. The finan-
cial position is, as might be expected, little
changed:—
1924. 1925.
Liabilities .. .. £55,277 £87,121
Freeholds .. .. 43,155 51,221

Stock 17,735 39,680
Book debts .. .. 51.072 61,650
Cash and sundries .. 548 639
Certainly liabilities are £31,844 heavier;
but as against that there is £21.945 more
stock in hand; and the bulk of it is news-
print in bond —handy stuff to have, and a
handy place to have it in these days of
shipping hold-ups. The larger drop of lia
bilities is, therefore, counterbalanced by the
increase of stock and book debts; and there
is £8066 more in freeholds to represent
the year’s work after paying the pref.
divs. But from that has to be deducted
whatever ought to be charged for plant
depreciation in excess of the year’s addi-
tions and renewals. The prefs. (9 p.c.
cumulative) are held by the public; the ordi-
naries, which now get a taste for the first
time, are in the hands of Joyntou Smith
and his associates.

The industrial Captain Kidds held up Mel-
bourne Steam to very good purpose judging
by the latest profit disclosed. For the first
time in a decade ordinary shareholders got
less than 10 p.c. Quite mildly the directors
characterised results as disappointing:—
During the 12 months there were two general
stoppages of shipping along the Australian coast
owing to labor troubles, and in addition there were
minor difficulties with various vessels extending over
practically the whole year. A new agreement lias
just been entered into with the Federated Seamen’s
Union, and it is hoped that services' may be main-
tained without interruption in future.
Hope springs eternal even in a shipowner’s
breast. Trading profits and interest on
investments brought in £25,595, according
to the published figures. The difference be-
tween that and the figures in the table repre-
sents net additions to reserves. On June
30 the insurance fund was £3744 greater
than it was a year before and the "provision
for depreciation, special renewals and re-
placements, bad and doubtful debts and con-
tingencies” had grown £7541. The £36,880
of the table may not, however, he all net
profit: it depends on what is a fair provision
for wear and tear: and the fact that shipping
property and much of the buildings and fur-
niture and plant are thrown together makes
an estimate of what is a fair thing impos-
sible. All that can be said is that the allow-
ances seem more than they need be. There
is. for instance, no indication of the volume
of risks the co. itself is carrying, if it is
carrying any at all; what is known is that
£20.000 was extracted from this fund for the
1918 gift issue. Which suggests that it is a
reserve to cover remote contingencies.
Further, consider these figures:-

Book debts were reduced and this money
along with some cash in hand was used to
reduce liabilities, including final payment
for the last purchase, s.s. Low an a. The
liquid position remained very strong,
£130.826 of the total being in Commonwealth
stock. Since 1914. net liouids have expanded
by £186,894, and the fleet, property and
plant by £185,020; and over the same period,
though capital has increased by £162,000,
only £26,000 of new money (the 6 p.c.
prefs.) has been got in. Even 8 p.c. therefore
represents a rich return to old holders. The
accumulated profits (£356,849) simplify the
div. problem, 5 p.c. earnings on total funds
being sufficient to provide for the prefs. and
pay the ords. 10 p.c.

This year profits were not drawn on for an
addition to the Officers’ Provident Fund, so
the figure is big compared with that for
1924. Actually there was little difference
in earnings. During the 12 months 40.000
new shares were issued and called to 10s.,
which means that a heavier hand must he
laid on profits if 14 p.c. divs. are to be
maintained. The management shouldn’t find
the task difficult. Last year £5488 was
added to reserves, bringing them to £92.204.
and, all going well, they will reach £lOO,OOO
within the next two years. But, especially
in view of the increases of capital at par,
the Board is not likely to call a halt at that
point; and shareholders will certainly have
no reason to grumble if they get what they
are getting now. Last year’s distribution was
equal to 8.6 p.c. on total average funds;
and, considering the security, that is hand-
some. Nor is there any visible likelihood
that earnings will slacken. Trust business
is still expanding:—
1900.. 116,329,656 | 1920.. £13,533,081

funds in the past decade make the growth
of the total all the more striking:—

In 1915 23.4 p.c. of the total trusts were
in mortgages. The high rates offered by gilt-
edged securities has resulted in a steady
relative decrease, and on June 30 the hold-
ing was only 7.6 p.c. —an advantage from
the trustee's point of view, because the
transfer to public securities, deposits, etc..
means slightly less expense in handling. But
there is no kick due to the trustee co. on
that account, since it has to do much extra
taxation work these days.

When the return of capital was sanctioned
a year ago the chief guess was as to the
quality of the. assets left. The doubt is
now more or less cleared up. Relatively a
record, the past year’s profit permitted of a
higher div. rate than ever, and that at a
time when one branch at least of the co.’s
activities was feeling the pinch of unsettled
and unprofitable conditions and in the face
of a fire which destroyed the co.’s big roofing-
tile works and “affected the profits for the
year.” _
In 1918 £55,000 of capital was returned,
reducing it to £llO,OOO. ' Two years later
assets were written up by £55,000, and re-
serves being tapped for a like amount a 100
p.c. gift issue of scrip was made. Divs.
have at no time been bloated —throughout
its career the co. has been very conservative
in that matter —but in view of the gift issue
the 6, 7 and 8 p.c. of 1921-24 were very
sweet. The profits were not, however, won
entirely from the business. Many years ago
the old-established firm had invested heavily
in property on which it placed its numerous
businesses, most of them requiring plenty of
space. It was profit from the sale of these
areas, made at a time of rising values, which
filled the co.’s pouch as the sale of timber,
etc., had never done.
The introductory table mustn’t be taken
too seriously. And that applies to late as
well as early figures. Note, for instance,
that only £lO3 was added to reserves last
year; yet the div. rate was lifted two points.
Grouped balance-sheet figures make an in-

subscribed portion of a former issue and
125,000 of the balance have been under-
writteti. This, the directors claim is sufli-
cient to finance works that _ will place the
co. on a revenue-earning basis. The money
already subscribed has been applied to con-
struction work. Tenders for building the
railway, expected to take about 12 months,
put the cost at not over £lOO,OOO, and a
further £30,000 is to be spent on jetties, etc.,
at Cole Bay, where the co. holds a freehold
grant of township sites. Coal reserves on
the ieases taken over are estimated at
20,800,000 tons. Analysis shows 55.6 d p.c.
fixed carbon, 8.2 p.c. ash and 31.8 p.c. vo.a-
tile content. If the market is satisfied with
the duality, easy mining conditions and near-
ness to. southern (Melbourne and. Adelaide)
consuming centres should favor selling rates,.
A net return of 6s. per ton on 150,000 tons
p.a. is expected as soon as delivery can be
assured, and that won’t be until the railway
is built. The co. will also then have about
75.000 acres of timber country, suited in part
for grazing and potato-growing, and con-
taining limestone and clay as well as coal.
Timber-cutting rights are held over an addi-
tional 10,000 acres of forest reserve. (A
net return of £lO,OOO p.a. on a sawmilling
capital outlay of £25.000 is estimated from
this side-line.) Though nominally preferen-
tial, for practical purposes the shares are
ordinaries: no ordinaries have been issued.
But 35.600 may be issued as either prefs.
or ordinaries, 04.400 ordinaries are held in
reserve, and 45,000 may be issued as first
prefs. with the consent of the shareholders.
The proposition has hung fire a long while;
but it is well worth consideration.

Queensland cocky M’s.P. who have been
asking vainly for railways for years rumbled
in wrath when in the last days of. the
session the Government put through a bill to
authorise the 60-mile line between the
Duchess and Mount Isa at an estimated cost
of £550,000. Still the bait was tempting.
Mt. Isa, Ltd., guarantees to spend £300,000
on development and water storage. Added
money, so to speak, of £lOO,OOO, spread, over
10 years, is to be provided to offset railway
losses. Mt. Isa Prop, guarantees to spend
another £lOO,OOO, and will weigh in with
£30,000 towards any railway deficit. The
debate was full of round, fat figures. Min-
ister Larcombe gives the “ore expectation”
as 20,000,000 tons, which at £5 a ton runs
into quite a lot of ciphers. But the elo-
quence faded to a whisper when an antici-
pated loss of £23,725 p.a. was mentioned.
The earnings are based on an estimated
carriage of 260 tons of concentrates daily
to Townsville, with 160 tons of coal from
Collinsville, back of Bowen.
* * * *
Mt. 'Cobalt, Cloncurry (Q.), is short of
water, and the mill and concentration plant
can do very little until rain falls. There
is nothing startling underground, but the
ore shoot has cut out in the 50ft. south level.
The Queen Sally, near Kajabbi, which looks
the most likely cobalt rival in the State, has
struck heavy water at 63ft., which has
stopped sinking in the north shaft.
Great Northern Tin shareholders are get-
ting ready to gleefully grasp a dividend when
the present clean-up is through. So far 30
tons of concentrates have been bagged worth
over £5OOO, and by the time the run is fin-
ished the total may pass the August £9OOO.
The Great Northern’s find has been the best
in Queensland for many years. It looks big,
but needs proving in width along the levels
before any accurate idea can be formed of
its extent.
* * * *
'Raven swood (Q.), although working a rich
vein, has not distributed divs., but has paid
its way and its debts. The ore averages over
£2O a ton, but costs are so high that there
is nothing for shareholders so far. Still,
that will come. Billy Clark is a director
now, and one of his moves is to alter, the
power and treatment plant. Further pros-
pectin g work will also be done, as there is so
much virgin ground; this takes cash, so the
shareholders’ fruit is not yet ready for
plucking. The stopes are all right, but in
several of them there is only three or four
inches of stone.
* * * *
The big but erratic reef of the Hercules
has given Bendigonians another disappoint-
ment! Twelve months ago the 1520 ft, level
was traversing rieh stone. Some of the
crushings yielded up to Soz., and the drive
for 100 ft. averaged Soz., continuing in pay-
able stone for another 100 ft. Great things
were hoped when stoping began over the
level; but values were less than payable
about 15ft. over the level. It was then
thought that the drive had gone through the
top of the shoot, and that big results would
come from below the level. The 1585 ft. level
is being pushed north, but it will be a few
months before it reaches the promising zone,
so a winze is being put down from the 1520 ft.
level at 720 ft. north, to test the depth of
the good stuff. Results were excellent for
the first 10ft., but since then values have
fallen off and indicate a shallow shoot.
Shares have slumped, and though it is quite
possible that the winze has fluked a poor
section, still the result is very disappointing,
and it will be some time before the 1585 ft.
level can connect with the winze, when the
block of stone can be tested on a big scale.
Stoping round the winze at 500 ft. N., which
averaged 18dwt. for 70ft. of sinking, also
indicates a limited shoot at this point.,
further emphasised by the fact that the
1620 ft. level passed 30ft. below in poor stone.

The Westralian manganese float has gone
to allotment. The object is to supply mar-
kets at home and abroad with manganese ore,
but competition is keen and the co. is too
weakly financed to make much headway.
‘ * * * *
Orion, which gave up mining at Niagara
(W.A.) and subsequently changed its mill
and other assets for the Kaniowna Consols,
held a meeting in London the other day.
Reference was made to two reefs previously
described as “plums,” and regular crushings
were predicted. Call notices are more likely.
* * * *
“Fine Gold”: Prospectus of the Wiluna
float is being circulated in the West. Nom-
inal capital is £BOO,OOO in £1 shores,
Vendors (owners of leases) receive 200,000
paid shares, promoters (A. H. Collier and
others) the same numoer, and Wiluna Devel-
opment Syndicate (which subscribed £50,000
to sink a new shaft to 300 ft.. extend a cross-
cut through the lode at 300 ft., and find
£15,000 for the vendors) another 100,000,
making half a million free shares in all.
The public is invited to subscribe for the
remaining 300,000 shares at par. As the
Wiluna Syndicate found the £50,000 men-
tioned, not much can be said against its
shareholders dividing 100,000 free shares.
But the allotment to vendors and promoters
needs justification. In any case the pros-
pectus is top-heavy. So far the crosscut
at 300 ft. has exposed 40ft. of ore estimated
to be worth 40s. per ton, and that is all that
can be said definitely at present regarding
possibilities. Certainly there is a chance
that development along the strike of the
lode will disclose satisfactory results.

From a man on the spot:—
C. B. Jensen, who was commissioned to investigate
the Radio mine (W.A.), reports regarding No. 3
level (180 ft.): “For 60ft. south of main shaft,
samples averaged 30dwt. over a width of 24in.
North of shaft, samples averaged 90dwt. for a length
of 80ft. over a width of 30in. - Having regard to
all facts, I strongly advise taking full advantage
of the agreement with the vendors to thoroughly
explore the 280 ft. level by driving and cross-
cutting. This work should enable the Board to
decide on sound lines whether the mine should be
purchased.” Jensen recommends that additional
five stamps be added to present five-stamper battery.
For years Radio has been sending only 100 tons
monthly to the plant from its narrow quartz veins.
As the plant can deal with five times that quantity,
Jensen should explain his desire for more pulverisers.
Having failed to locate a continuation of the
Radio veins at depth, Hansel Mundy Co. has been
attending to the old Green Harp lode, worked for
15 years by the owners of the Radio Deeps, over
which Hansel Mundy has an option. Over 100 tons
are already broken and await treatment, but the
prospects this offer may be gauged from the fact,
that Hansel Co. has fired a notice of termination
of option into the vendors’ camp.

“Westport”: Despite the annual importa-
tion of 700,000 tons from Australia, anfl the
fact that the M.L. Government refuses to
burn its own bituminous coal on its own
railways, the number of M.L. coalmines is on
the increase. At Seddonville, where the Gov-
ernment closed its mine as non-paying back
about 1913, there are now some ten small
mines with a far greater output than was
ever achieved by the State concern. The
small mine lias much to commend it, as it
has no costly staff to keep up, and the dead-
head is unknown. As most of the mines in
the West Coast bituminous coalfield (the only
one in M.L.) are at a higher level than the
railways, tramway haulage is being scrapped
and water-sluicing the coal through wooden
boxes used instead. The Westport-Stockton
Co. has dispensed with its large electric
motors and endless-rope haulage system,
which brought the coal a distance of seven
miles, and has installed a flume 5 miles GO
chains long. At a recent trial 3000 tons
were delivered to the bins in three hours.
Prior to the installation of water-carriage the
endless rope and motors could handle only
about 800 or 900 tons per day; so, even if
the flume and dams were costly, they should
soon pay for themselves. As a rule, the
coal can be delivered from the mine to bins
at railway for about 2d. per ton, where
tramway haulage may cost 3s. 6d. or 4s. a
ton. In addition to the foregoing innova-
tion a by-product plant is to be erected at
Granity to deal with the output of a mine
adjoining the Westport Coal Co.’s Millerton
colliery. Five acres have been purchased
by the syndicate, and operations on the new
works —the first in M.L. —will soon com-
mence. The only thing the M.L. coal indus-
try now wants is an assured market? and
to obtain that the industry aims at the
exclusion of the imported article. None of
the mines in M.L. have had regular work for
a long period ; if it was not lack of orders
it was strikes. Between one and the other
the miner has had a lean year or two.

“Talpa” (from a far oilfield) : “General
Oil Seeker’s” letter (B. 9/7/’25) is very in-
teresting as a historical record, but it is
difficult to follow his reasoning when he
argues that oil will be found only at great
depths iu Australia. It is true that most of
the signs of oil that have been got i!n
Queensland, such as the paraffin-wax obtained
from Kuthven, Springleigh and Longrcach
town wells, were struck at fair depths, the
first at 4000 ft., the second at Gsooft. and the
third at about 3200 ft.; but, significantly,
right on top of the granite, according to Gov-
ernment Geologist Morton. Quite recently
a U.S. geologist, Roger Batson, in a report
on the Rocky Mountain fields, expressed an
opinion that oil existed everywhere, the only
question of finding it being the economic
possibility of drilling deep enough. It does
not follow, however, that all oil deposits
are deep seated, the fields of Burma, Baku,
Indiana, Borneo and many others being proof
to the contrary. Although the Tertiary de-
posits produce the world’s largest quantity
of petroleum at present, perhaps there is an
undue importance attached to this fact, as
in past periods the Cretaceous of Mexico,
which has produced 1,250,000,000 barrels of
oil in 23 years, led the w r ay, and the Car-
boniferous in Oklahoma is producing half
a million barrels of oil daily at pre-
sent. Australia has not yet produced
a barrel of oil, but is in no worse case than
the State of Arkansas was down to 1921.
It had not then produced a single barrel of
oil, but recorded 48 million barrels in 1924
from a depth averaging about 2000 ft. The
tremendous areas of sedimentaries in Aus-
tralia, with their numerous arenaceous beds,
must contain petroliferous matter. It is now
admitted by geologists that there cannot be
such a thing as a “dry” porous stratum. It
would be a physical impossibility. It must
contain water, gas or oil, or possibly all three.
In the past some of these strata were sup-
posed to contain air, but that idea has been
upset, this “air” proving to be methane, a
valuable fuel. The trouble with Australia
is that it doesn’t look for petroleum on the
proper lines. Traces are generally found in
wells sunk for water, which are, naturally,
not capable of being bailed dry, and thus
any commercial production is “drowned.”
Specimen stone sent by George Laurie and
exhibited in Sydney corroborates the report
of geologist 11. I. Jensen about Tanami
(N.T.). The “coarse crystals” mentioned by
Jensen are like the rich stuff that used to
be the main feature of gold production at
Gympie, and helped to keep Charters Towers
on the map for three decades.

Taranaki Oilfields (N.Z.) is still mixing
too much water with it. At Moturoa bore
there is “a nice show of oil, but still accom-
panied by water. It may be necessary to
set another casing.” At Tarata the hole
has reached 3640 feet in shale with Bjin.
casing to 3562 feet.

Pyrites at the New Guinea Dubinin mine
are burning still, and the entrance has been
re-sealed. Now the programme is to open-
cut the formation. A first bench will expose
ore at 42ft. above the 105 ft. level. The next
face will go down to 105 ft. The Laloki
already is being operated in the same way.
From the September campaign it yielded
2460 tons of 4 p.c. ore, the smelter result
from 2138 tons treated being 455 tons of
matte estimated to contain 85 tons copper
and 1530 z. gold. Coal supplies ran out, so
converting could not be done. Nor had the
smelters a clear run, because of tricky work
by the electric plant and the water jackets.
Erie Huntley’s worries do not seem to be-
come any less at Bootle’s Inlet.

“Black Tracker”: That a crushed insect
should be the means of quashing a will in-
volving £lO,OOO sounds far fetched, yet such
a thing may come to pass. A well-to-do bache-
lor disappointed his relatives by leaving his
money to the wife of the man with whom
he had boarded for some years, the lady, it
is believed, having been an old sweetheart of
his. The will, although home-made, was all
right, but trouble arose concerning the sig-
AIDS TO THE LANDSCAPE.
THE ENGLISHMAN : “Yah bally scenery is all very well.

THE AUSTRALIAN: “But we don’t miss that. We always
have the overseas visitors, you know.”
nature. During the time the document had
been stowed away an insect, presumably a
spider, had crawled into its folds, and had
been squashed there in the vicinity of the
signature, over which its contents had spread.
Even then there might have been no trouble
if the interested parties had not tried to clean
off the mess, and in doing so partly oblit-
erated the signature. The relatives con-
sulted a lawyer, who now has the matter in
hand. He suggests that the story of the
spider may have been faked in order to
cover a forgery. As neither of the witnesses
can be located, it is difficult to say how
things will go.
“X.D.”: A Victorian Judge has just
thrown doubt upon the ancient tradition that
the husband who wants to do the right thing
must at least attempt to break the nose of
the man he finds in '‘compromising circum-
stances” with his wife. Now that divorce
and the acts that lead to it have become
fashionable pastimes, it would be well if
some decision was reached as to what the
injured husband’s conduct really should be
in such cases. One Melbourne husband, who
found his wife merely canoodling with an-
other man, was esteemed by the Bench to
have had sufficient justification for his
assault, although nothing worse than kisses
was alleged; another was fined £lO for an
assault upon a man he had found in his
wife’s bedroom and chased into the street.

“Kiwi”: The romance of the Seafield
family in Maoriland is having a curious
sequel in the Scottish law courts. Some-
where in the closing years of last century
a middle-aged man named Grant, who had
worked for some time as a laborer, received
information, while digging potatoes near
Oamaru, that he had become Lord lieid-
liaven and heir to the earldom of Seafield.
The new peer finished his potato-digging job
before receiving rather coldly the congratu-
lations of the local aristocracy; and his lady
did not immediately sever her connection
with the Salvation Army. Events then fol-
lowed one another rather swiftly. Lord
Reidhaven became Earl of Seafield and died,
handing on the title to his son, who married
a young lady from Christchurch. Now the
child of that marriage is Countess of Sea-
field in her own right, and the right has just
been challenged by Alexander Grant, a re-
tired tutor, who is TO. The aged Alexander
claims that, while the present holder of the
title is only the daughter of the eleventh earl,
he is the eldest son of the seventh earl by
a verbal marriage recognised in Scottish law.
He asserts that he is the son of Caroline
Stuart, younger daughter of the eleventh
Lord Blantyre, who was married on board
a sailing-ship and carried ashore on a sail-
or’s back at Banff. As a baby he was
brought up, he says, at Gordon Castle by
a gardener, and afterwards given a univer-
sity education. Why he did not try to make
good his claim when the potato-digging heir
was discovered is not explained.

“Cable-crammer”: The cablemen on the
Cocos Islands (Indian Ocean), where the
Emden’s bones lie, would have
the band out if a treasure-
hunting expedition (B.
29/10/’25) hove in sight off
their lonely Eden. The only
bonanza in that line that has
ever come their way was an
Australian film-promoter in a
chartered steamer, who with
their hilarious assistance re-
constructed the Sydney-Emden
incident, flinging in a roman-
tic triangle between a dusky
(Malay) damsel, a foul Hun
spy and a deliriously hand-
some white Australian hero to
make full measure. The pro-
per designation of the Cocos
Islands in which Australia
has a proprietary interest is
C’ocos-Keeling, after the
worthy Scot who found them,
one of whose descendants, by
the way, is at present second
in command of the Federal
Naval College at Jervis Bay
(N.S.W.). The Cocos Island
of the numerous treasure-hunts
lies off the coast of Central
America, and unless somebody
has removed the goods, they
are certainly there. No trea-
sure except copra has ever
come out of Cocos-Iveeling,
but there is a relic of Aus-
tralia’s only naval battle in
private hands in Adelaide. It
is the much-bashed Morse key
_ on which G. H. K. La Nauze,
an Australian, sent out the
SOS from Cocos radio that
brought the Sydney on the
scene at 9.30 of a sunny morn-
ing, November 9, 1914. It

“Whizbang”: This record of my friend
Blank will take some beating. On the
Somme in TO he was helping to carry petrol-
tins of drinking-water from supports to the
front line. It was before the days of duck-
boards, the country was a sea of mud. and
the front line was barely 40 yards from Fritz
and absolutely isolated from the rear as re-
gards communication saps. The water-
carriers got fairly close to their objective
under cover of a! light mist before they were
spotted, and had to run for it. The only
bullet to go near its target was one which
passed through the sleeve of Blank’s tunic
without touching the skin. Four months
later, during the period of open warfare fol-
lowing the evacuation of Bapaume, a Uhlan
bullet struck Blank on his tin-hat, passing
through it and a cap-comforter he was wear-
ing without even grazing his scalp. At
Bullecourt six weeks later, when casualties
were particularly heavy, he received a slight
shrapnel wound which sent him to Blighty.
ANOTHER THINK COMING.
“And you'll think about your loving wifey all day?”
“I’ll think about nothing clue."
“You darling! But you’ll take just a minute off to remember about
those theatre tickets, won’t you?”
Returning in time to go into the line at
Wyschaote, he was peacefully dozing in his
dugost when a shell lobbed on top, passed
through the frail sandbag-roof and buried
itself in the floor of the dugout right between
Blank’s legs : —a dud !
“Peroxide”: Probably the most one-idea’d
person in Australia is a tall, wiry man who
came into our Melbourne bar, where he pro-
ceeded to sample every strange kind of liquor
that was suggested to him. He confided
to me that Sale was the biggest town he had
ever been in before. “Down for the Cup?”
I asked; but he looked rather blank. “The
Melbourne Cup,” I added. “Hope you enjoy
it.” He looked at me with some eagerness.
“I hope I do, too,” he said. “Can I get it
here?”

“Ex-Dig.” : That yarn about the Germans
boiling down their dead to extract the fat
from the bodies for war purposes has bobbed
up again. A certain Brigadier-General
Cliarteris is reported to have boasted in
America that he faked the yarn for Chinese
consumption ; but the next morning he repu-
diated his alleged confession, and various
leading Britons whose opinions were asked
said the story was so obviously wrong that
it was not “issued officially.” All the same,
the canard was circulated, with sundry frills,
such as the reports of alleged eye-witnesses
who had seen corpses stacked in trucks on
the way to the boiling-down factory; and
stout citizens snorted in tram and ferry
about the revolting materialism of the enemy.
Another absurd lie which had a circulation
and gained a similar belief was an alleged
translation of an edict by the German Gov-
ernment calling upon home-staying citizens,
male and female, to produce children
regardless of the marriage tie, in order to
fill the gaps in the, population caused by the
war. That yarn was traced back to its
origin—an attempt at lewd humor.

“X.N.0.”: Coincidence? “Woorook’s”
story (B. 29/10/’25) of the Melbourne man
who suffered a sartorial setback on arriving
at a swish dance, and who, while his wife
repaired the damage in the ladies’ cloakroom,
was projected sans culottp into the ballroom
through one door owing to clamorous de-
mands by a third party for entry at the other
one, is almost an exact narration of a Malta
episode I witnessed in 1905 or 1906. In
that case, however, the gentleman was a
very tubby naval officer, and he did have a
boat-cloak on, which reached to a little above
his knees. The worst feature there was
that he was unmarried, and the lady who
effected the repairs was the sympathetic
sister of a brother officer.
“Iford”: Two seaports in Australia once
liable to be confused—postally at all events
—were Geraldton (W.A.) and Geraldton
(Q.) until the latter recliristened itself Innis-
fail. Sometimes, it was said, the confusion
was more than postal. A picturesque yarn
lingered for years of how a Yankee wind-
jammer once arrived at the east-coast Gerald-
ton in the early
morning and dis-
gorged a skipper
who strode into
the township, about
the time the pubs
were opening, de-
manding to be
directed to the
ship’s agents. The
reason why nobody
was able to oblige
him was simply
that the firm he
was asking for was
located in the
other Geraldton,
almost the whole
breadth of the con-
tinent away. It
was a very angry
Yank who realised
that he was about
35 meridians of
longitude and 10
parallels of lati-
tude off his proper
destination. After
that, the Queens-
lander who told me
this story declared,
it was decided to
alter the name of
the younger Gerald-
ton to Innisfail. I
asked him when it
happened, and he
said it was Federa-
tion year, 1901. I
might have be-
lieved him if he
hadn’t spoiled the
story by represent-
ing the profane
shellback as asking
for a shipping firm
which had gone
out of business in
the W.A. Gerald-
ton six or seven years before tlie date men-
tioned. Nevertheless, he became thoroughly
aggrieved when I accused him of trying to
pull my leg, so I suppose there may be some
foundation for the yarn.

“R.D.”: “8.11.N.’5” par. (B. 22/10/’25)
about the casual behavior of a 3f>uth Aus.
youngster after saving a schoolmate from
drowning brings to mind another young hope-
ful who was loath to strike an attitude at
the correct moment. At Brighton (Vic.)
he hopped in after a mate who had got out
of his depth, and after a long struggle
succeeded in bringing him to land. When he
arrived home his mother dealt it out to him
for getting his clothes wet, and the boy was
too proud to dodge a thrashing by telling his
heroic story. It was not till the parents
received notice that the Royal Humane
Society’s medal was to be presented to him
that the truth came out. Afterwards the
modest youth became a Rhodes scholar, and
is at present Professor-designate of History
at one of our universities.

“Spare Coi-p”: Our m.o. gave a distinct
start when to his “Well, wliat’s the matter
with you, boy?” an Aussie replied that he
had been killed at Passcliendaele. He stuck
to his tale, said that he had felt a numbness
in his breast and then didn’t remember any
more, and, being asked whether he thought
a dead man wanted rations, denied having
eaten anything. It was decided to send him
away, and to observe whether he was con-
scious enough of being alive to collect his
belongings before he went. But the sufferer
was so oblivious of owning anything /is he
was “marched out” that suspicions were
completely lulled. It was only long after-
wards, when he was safe in England, that
it was discovered he had previously arranged
with his mate to look after his chattels and
see that they were sent after him.

“Terri”: It was in the home of a Rot-
orua (M.E.) family named Simpson that
the peaceful Sabbath morn was suddenly dis-
turbed by the floor of the family wash-
house hitting the roof. Some years ago a
bore had been put down there to secure hot
water, and an enterprising geyser seeking
an outlet discovered the vent and came up-
wards at top speed. For 12 hours it held
the attention of the admiring neighborhood,
and then retired gracefully, leaving only the
wreckage as evidence of its excursion. Such
occurrences at Rotorua are not uncommon,
and the residents have learned not to be
peeved at being suddenly uplifted.

THE INTOXICATED SEASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The air is like a wine of joy
With bubbles leaping up and down;
Its draughts have made me feel a boy
Cavorting through a jazzy town.
The streets are gay, the pavements bright,
The very sparrows whistle and sing,
Green-shooting trees make fresh delight,"
And even windows bloom with Spring.
The buildings tall have doffed their shrouds —
Each pane a gleam of laughter sheds —
And smile beneath white-petalled clouds
With which they’ve garlanded their heads.
Glad folk skip past me everywhere,
Their murmurs lilting like a song,
And, casting off the clothes of care,
Joy trips it pink-limbed in the throng.
Unshamed I own that I am drunk,
Full to the neck with bubbling joy;
And in that bath of mirth have shrunk
The cares that caused iny heart annoy.
Inebriate is all the earth
And full of songs that must be sung;
The bubbling Bacchanalian mirth
Suggests that even Spring is sprung.

A DOG BY ANY OTHER NAME.
“Industrial disturbances, accompanied by disorder, occur in many parts of Australia.... Mr. Charlton, leader of the Federal Labor party, repudiates connection with the Communists.”
CHARLTON’S NEIGHBOR: “That dam’ dog of yours has been killing my fowls again.”
CHARLTON: “Nonsense, man! I haven’t got a dog. That’s a hallucination.”

“8.T.”: This case with its beginnings in
the West ought to interest some picture-
maker. The youngest of three brothers who
were jointly working a mining lease thought
he had been robbed of his share, and swore
he would get even with the other two. Ten
years passed, during which time the de-
frauded brother struck it rich. He had,
however, contracted an incurable disease
which the doctors considered might prove
fatal at any moment. He thereupon in-
structed a solicitor to draw up a will in
which he left his money to the two elder
brothers, on condition that, when notified,
they would agree to take up residence in
a doom adjoining that in which he lay. They
would thus be able to be present at his
death-bed when called upon. Both threw
up their jobs and set off post-haste to carry
out this proviso. The sick man lingered for
three weeks. The wait had been trying and
expensive to the brothers, but the promised
reward would compensate for all that. On
the day following the death another solicitor
arrived unexpectedly on the scene bringing
a will dated two days later than the other.
By it both brothers were thanked for their
loving vigil and bequeathed one shilling
each, the balance of the estate going to
charities.
“Elsie Ghee”: Melbourne's Henley-on-
Yarra is an example of an annual event
HORSEY, KEEP YOUR TAIL UP.
“I hope you won't mind my mentioning it, dear, but I’m getting
a bit fed up with these vegetarian meals of yours. Four
times last week I caught myself whinnying.”
w r hich, though it has retained and even in-
creased its popularity, has notably changed
its appeal. Its origin was Society-cwm-
rowing, with squattocratic families like the
Fairbairns and Blackwoods as sponsors.
Society dressed itself and hired elaborate
houseboats for the occasion and “Henley”
was admitted into the exclusive company of
chic adjectives. Presently Suburbia bought
itself canoes and vivid cushions and sum-
mery clothes and joined the merry throng.
Finally Demos woke to Henley—its cheap-
ness, its opportunity for making- a brave show
with one-and-elevenpenny bargains as a dress-
basis. Society bore up well for a time, but
the drift soon began. Providentially, about
that time arose an excuse. Moonee Valley
Race Club, from being a private club
ranking little higher than a pony-course, be-
gan, under the guidance of A. V. Hiskens —
who doubles the parts of husband of the
ground-landlady and secretary of the club —
to be classed as soci-lly chic. Hiskens
granted the ground to the Polo Club, and
the. chicness of ground, club and race-
meetings was established! Moonee Valley
Cup meeting falls now on Henley Day—-a
social excuse made and provided. This wear's
Henley-on-Yarra was a record in attendance,
in rowing entries, in interest; but it was the
triumph of the one-and-elevenpenny fashions.

“Nakhoda”: One half of us doesn’t know
how the other half thrives. I overtook a
picture-dealer hawking bad American lithos
from one cocky’s door to another in the
cow-country down Tommerong (N.S.W.)
way the other day. The works of art were
priced from 2s. to 2s. 6d., and he sold
an average of a couple a, day, so lie told me
in a submissive whisper. His wife and IH-
months-old baby followed on in a dilapi-
dated caravan drawn by two dirty white
ponies of advancing age, which covered 10
miles or so a day. They had lived in their
conveyance for so many years they had for-
gotten when they started. A crushed-looked
gypsy party wdiicli nevertheless described
itself as Australian ! The boat-communities
of Canton. China, were the nearest parallels
I could think of.

“Morimoto”: The official person who, in
announcing the birthday of his Majesty
Yoshihito, Emperor of Japan, annually pulls
the S. M. Herat, n's leg about the great age
of the dynasty, came to light again last week.
“The Emperor." he states, “is the 122nd
monarch in a direct and unbroken line dating
back to the year 660 8.C., 605 years before
the landing of Julius Caesar in Britain, and
1726 years before the Norman Conquest.”
The siur on this young country should in-
voke some counter-propaganda. For in-
stance : “Tom Bolsh, Emperor of Australia,
is the 122.0015 t monarch in a direct and un-
broken line dating back to the Pithecan-
thropus erectus, 1,000,099 years before tin'
arrival of the First Fleet at Botany Bay. and
1,000,134 years before the first (N.S.W.)
Australian Constitution.” This proposition
is at least as capable of documentary proof
as the other. Authentic Jap history does
not open until 500-600 A.r>. At the back of
that is legend.
* * * *
“Verri": Although the question of color
practically never occurs as between the
whites and Maoris in Maoriland, the Do-
minion is having some difficulty in establish-
ing the rights of
Brown Brother
overseas. In Aus-
tralia the Maori is
specially m e n-
tioned for voting
privileges, b u t
America insists
on regarding him
as a “colored pus-
son” and declines
to admit him to
membership of her
guarded societies.
For years the ad-
mission of Maoris
to the Independent
Lodge of Oddfel-
lows has been a
point of contention
between M.L. and
the parent body
in IT.S. The Do-
minion body re-
fuses to ban the
Maori, and accords
him full privileges
with extreme
friendliness:
America says that
the thing is not
done in her terri-
tory, and, should
she relent the
negroes and the
natives of the West
Indies will compli-
cate matters by
demanding similar treatment. The warmth
and eloquence of the appeals made for Hori
and co. frankly astonished the American
body.

“Morris”: Darky hailed from an inland
town, and a few days after joining up
showed me a telegram which stated that his
wife was dangerously ill. I got him four
days' special leave, but he had only been
gone a few hours when a gaily-dressed female
invaded the camp in search of iiim. When
she was made acquainted with his sad mis-
sion she became furiously angry, and flour-
ished a dirty scrap of paper in my
face. “There’s me lines!” she yelled, and
the document she show r ed made good her
claim. On his return Darky was paraded,
and ordered to make an allotment of at least
2s. a day in favor of his legal spouse. As
he refused to cancel the allotment already
made to the unofficial one, his net rate of pay
was reduced to Is. a day. We all felt sorry
for the victim of circumstances, especially
wiien he confided to us that his missus was
no good, that he hadn’t lived with her for
years, and that only lack of cash had pre-
vented him from divorcing her. But his
troubles weren’t over yet. A week prior to
embarkation an officer of the State Child-
ren’s Department bore down upon the camp
and demanded that Darky should make pro-
vision, to the extent of Is. per day, for a
prospective mother w T bo lived not in his home
town, but in a hamlet adjacent Thereto. As
DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
“Poor Herbert is advertising for a housekeeper!”
“Oh, has his wife left him?”
“No, — returned.”
this latest demand would have mopped up
the remainder of Darky's pay, I pointed our
that a soldier couldn’t fight on an empty
pocket; and finally the matter was settled,
to Darky’s satisfaction, on a 50-50 basis.
On the morning of the Landing Darky
assured me that it was the best lurid day of
his life. All through Gallipoli and in France
he fought cheerfully on sixpence a day; and
he only grew peeved and dispirited when a
grateful country sought to return him to Aus-
tralia —'and his loved ones.
* * * *
“Henry Pannikin”: We were hanging on
to a bit of trench in ’l7 at a place called
Marcclcave, in the Somme area. Things
were quiet; the enemy, as far as could be
judged, was some distance away, and to
break the monotony we decided on a bit of
rifle practice. A stunted tree with a few
branches standing right out in No Man’s Land
was the target. Four shots were fired with-
out effect, and then Harry, my dugout mate,
hit one of the branches. The tree shivered,
broke into a fast trot in the direction of
the German line, and was safely home before
we recovered from the shock. The German
scout whom we had selected for a target had
stood in that disguise, to our knowledge, every
day for a fortnight.
* * * *
“Ratio” : Mention of the site of Canberra
(Pi. 22/10/’25) recalls that only one of our
State capitals stands exactly where it was
originally meant to be. Captain Phillip, dis-
satisfied with Botany Bay, recommended by
Banks, found Port Jackson “the finest har-
bor in the world.” and against the letter
of his orders established Sydney on its
shores. In Tasmania, Collins decided that
Risdon Cove was unsuitable, and selected
the site of Hobart for the capital. The Par-
tnclia landed the founders of W.A. at Garden
Island, pending the location of a more fitting
centre. Wakefield’s impatient immigrants,
who reached S.A. in 1836, dumped them-
selves down on Kangaroo Island, but Colonel
Light fixed the ideal site for Adelaide. (En-
counter Bay and Port Lincoln wrnre also
advocated.) The original Queensland settle-
ment was a penal depot at Redcliffe, on
Moreton Bay, which had to be abandoned
owing to absence of water. Melbourne is
the lone exception. When Batman had
rowed about six miles up the Yarra, he
noted : “This wall be the place for a village.”
In 1536 Captain Lonsdale, despatched from
Sydney by Governor Bonrke, found 177
people on the site, and confirmed Batman’s
choice. Shortly afterwards Bourke, w T ho
preferred Gellibrand’s Point, named it Wil-
liamstown, after the sovereign; Batman’s
village, less important, received the name of
the Prime Minister.

“Blanc”: Not many have had the experi-
ence of having a shiny skull handed to them
with their names and habits printed indelibly
thereon; but it
came to a section
of us looking for a
safe possie just
out of Bapaume in
1017. Our dugout
was a vault which
contained probably
a hundred guillo-
tined skulls with
the blade-marks at
the base —relics of
the French Revolu-
tion—and it wasn’t
long before our
“dag” had a neat
row arranged, each
pencilled with a
cobber’s name and
a few 'facts cdn-<
corning him, appro-
priate or otherwise.
Long Tom —we’ll
call him Smith —
w r as called down
and solemnly giver/
his. It was in-
scribed : “ Pte. T.
Smith. Champion
Rum an d Fa g
Hum.” He swore
off the practice
from that moment.
“205" : Wh a t
was the longest
stretch a Digger
went without leave
(8.3/8/’25) ? Well,
I left Melbourne
with the Ist Divvy
on October 21,
1914, and didn’t
hit London till the
end of .Tune, 1917.
That was my first
leave with the ex-
ception of 3G
hours from Tel el
Kebir to Cairo. Of
the two years and
eight months SP
spent nearly hall!
in France, and was
never absent from my unit except as a
casualty. I might add that 24 of my 30
hours’ leave in Egypt were spent as a guest
of the main guard in Alexandria.

“X.R.N.”: The sacred and other ditties
quoted recently as going to the tunes of
G.P.O. and Public Library clock chimes re-
mind me of the old-time naval gunner s
method of getting the right interval between
the guns of a salute. The gunners were,
and are, warrant officers, and their peren-
nial worry about keeping the store accounts
correct was conducive to pessimism. So their
ditty went as follows: “Fire, one; if 1
wasn’t a gunner I wouldn’t be here. Fire,
two ; if I wasn’t, etc. Fire, three.” And so
on. It was amusing to listen to, but it kept
a dead-accurate interval. The modern gun-
ner uses a stop-watch.
THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE.
“And, darling Gwendoline, do yon want a
long engagement?”
“No — I'd rather chance a short marriage.”
“W.Y.N.”: There must be many streams
in Australia that have been used for baptis-
mal purposes (B. 8/10,/'25). The Speck's
contributions include the South Esk. near
Perth ; the Lake River, near Longford, and,
I think. Longford Creek; also the Inglis
River and Camp Creek. Afterwards the con-
gregation at Perth installed a proper bap-
tismal tank, and nearly had an inquest the
first time it was used —the candidate's cloth-
ing caught on a nail on the side of the tank
under water’.
DINING OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They took the table next to mine,
And never as much as glanced at me;
They’d evidently come to dine,
But ate as robins might at tea—
A little nibble now and then,
Once in a while a sweet, low word,
Then silence till their hearts beat ten j
And from their faces I inferred
That what the waiter said or did
Or whether the cloth was laid aright
Was quite forgotten, lost amid
The pangs of their sweet appetite.
For if he smiled, or touched her hand,
His shining eye, her flushed, glad cheek,
Spoke all that lovers understand.
In language love alone can speak.
I watched them till they rose to go;
A sympathetic joy was mine,
For I suspect we act just so
Whenever we go oiit to dine.
VICTORIA.

Ex-Federal member William McMillan,
Parkes's Ministerial colleague in 1889-91,
will be 75 on Nov. 14. He and ex-Premier
Joseph Carruthers are the only survivors of
the Ma State delegation to the Federation
Convention of 1897-98. There are only 10
other survivors of the 50 who sat in the
Convention at the Sydney sessions: Justices
Isaacs and Higgins (High Court), Dr. Quick
and Alec Peacock, of Vic. ; Dr. Cockburn,
Glynn, K.C., and Symon, K.C., of S. Aus.;
Elliott Lewis, of the Speck; and Walter
James, K.C., and A. H. Henning, K.C., of
W.A. Josh Symon, in his 80th year, is the
oldest of the twelve.
Just-dead Charles Fairbairn kept aloof
from the politics which landed elder brother
George into the Vic. Agent-General’s chair
in London ; what both brothers held in com-
mon, besides vast acres, was a love of oars-
manship. George was stroke in the first
inter-State boatrace, and Charles stroked
Geelong Grammar in the first Ilead-of-the-
River race, and rowed for Cambridge in an
English Uni. contest. The father, George
Fairbairn, was one of Melbourne’s early
settlers; his wife was a daughter of the
Georgo Armytage wdio was amongst the first
to bring sheep across from the Speck.

which he promptly
returned, explain-
ing: “I am averse
to the principle of

and send herewith
my cheque for a

Senator WILSON,
the fighting
member of the
Government’s
Senate 'group in
South Aus.
The quick changes in the S.A. Assembly
made the late Peter Allen, with 20 years’
experience, junior only to Attorney-General
Denny (23) and Coneybeer, who first sat
in 1893; and all three suffered one defeat
and so had not continuous service. Premier
Gunn and Opposition-leader Barwell are
comparative infants, with just under and
just over 10 years’ service respectively.
R. L. Butler, son of the late politician
who was in his time Treasurer, Premier and
Speaker in South Aus., has been appointed
Opposition Whip in the Assembly, in suc-
cession to just-dead Peter Allen. There was
talk of fusing the post'with that of secretary
to the Liberal party, held by 11. S. Hudd,
but they are to remain separate jobs.
After doing good work which will extend
into the umpteenth generation, Father James
O’Dwyer died last week in Melbourne. He
was rector of Xavier College from 1908 to
1918. and filled the school with his exhor-
tation that a good sporting spirit is one of
the essentials of Christian manhood. After-
wards he was member of the Council of
Public Education and rector of Newman
College. His father was a military officer,
and his brother Governor of the Punjab
during the Amritsar riots; another brother
took the educational-religious track, and is
rector of St. Pat.’s College in East Mel-
bourne.
Australia has probably been visited now
by every race under Heaven. There was a
small party of Esquimaux rattling a mission-
ary-box some years ago; and lately Tasliix
Angbo arrived from Thibet. Rev. E. Pal-
grave Davy, F.R.G.S., who has done some
missioning on the roof of the world, has
given him a run round Maoriland and Aus-
tralia.
Written his last script, Terence Albert
Green, of Sydney, grandson of a noted Har-
ley-street specialist. An Army Medical man
in the S’Afriean
disturbance, he fin-
ished in charge of
the Australian and
Maoriland services.
He was mentioned
three times in de-
spatches by Kit-
chener, and earned
a string of deeora-
tio n s that his
native modesty
kept hidden. ITis
only son is a Syd-
ney violinist of
note.
“Uncle Nod”
HOUGHTON, a
well-known Hobart
business man, who
does a lot of the
talking at his
little city’s broad-
casting station.
Ex-Premier Gillies, of Queensland, who
is now to get £2OOO a year for a judicial job,
started to earn a crust at the age of 12
on his father’s farm. Away from that his
first couple of jobs were bullock-driving and
pit-saWing in the big cedar scrub; and since
then he has been cedar-getter, horse-driver,
fencer, engine-driver, cane-cutter, navvy,
scrub-feller, horsebrea'ker, miilhand, factory
manager, builder, general farmer, sugar-
grower, postmaster and politician.
James Ashton, the veteran seascape
painter of Adelaide, has been warmly fare-
welled on giving .up his post as drawing-
master at Prince Alfred school, after close
on 40 years’ service. Either there or in
his own studio lie has helped in the early
training of nearly every artist of note pro-
duced by South Aus. Will Ashton, now of
Sydney, has gone further than his father,
but still shows signs of the early influence.
“Nat Lew” : With deep regret I note the
demise of the hero of my early youth, Eugen
Sandow, at the early ago of 58. Did disease
find a weak spot in that superb physique, or
was it merely a case of overtaxed heart?
As science will surely investigate liis clay,
the result should throw some light on
whether intense physical culture really pays.
Personally, I all but wrecked my nervous
system in the vain attempt to emulate his
biceps. Although, apparently, it is in the
power of man to materially increase his
bodily strength, it seems that his span of
life tends to shorten in the process, for who
knows of a professional strong man ever
becoming a centenarian or even an octo-
genarian?
Stanley Hosie, 84; has just answered the
call of bushranger Death. He was twice
stuck up by the Ben Hall gang in ’63 while
storekeeping at Chloola (N.S.W.). On the
first occasion Gilbert and O’Meally were the
intruders, the former, as usual, being very
jocular while they helped themselves to some
£25 in cash and much booty, particularly
clothing. A few months later the whole
gang, dressed like mounted-police and at first,
mistaken by Hosie for such, again patronised
the same store. O’Meally meantime had
murdered Barnes, storekeeper of Murrum-
burrali, but that did not prevent Hosie, when
he discovered their identity, from putting up
a resistance. He was soon overpowered and
handcuffed, the store was ransacked, and all
valuable draperies were carried off to re-
ward the local lassies who acted as bush
telegraphs. Hosie was born a Scot, but
showed enterprise and judgment by becoming
an Australian at the age of two.
“Sir Sol”: Re ex-Senator Mathicson (B.
22/10/’25). It is not generally known that
he is a grandson of the late Spencer Perce-
val, a former Prime Minister of the Cold
Land, who was brutally murdered in the
lobby of the House of Commons by the
assassin Bellingham in 1812. At the trial,
which was unduly hastened, it was dis
covered that the murderer had a well-founded
grievance: but that of course did not excuse
his fiendish crime, and he was executed with-
in a week of the murder. Perceval, by the
way, was a son of the Earl of Egmont.
T. T. Davey, for years an alderman of
Melbourne, felt compensated a little for the
total loss of his sight when the other day
Mayor Brunton and Solly. M.L.A., presented
him with addresses of appreciation on behalf
of the City Council and the Exhibition trus-
tees. For many years a sufferer from eye
trouble, Mr. Davey recently lost the sight
of both eyes, and has retired from public life.
Private Enterprise is claiming the services
of. Owen .Tones, chairman of the financially
hamstrung Vic. Forests Commission since
1919. New Zealand Perpetual Forests, Ltd.,
has offered him £5OO a year more than the
State Government has been paying him, and
after waiting to see whether the bureaucrats
were prepared to give: him something better,
•Tones is taking the offer. The N.Z. Co. has
been very successful in raising money on
bonds maturing when the forests it is plant-
ing become ripe for the sawmill, and Jones
expects to find himself more happily placed
than in the parsimonious State Department.
He is 37, and was Assistant-Conservator
of Forests in Ceylon before taking his Vic-
torian job.
“X.N.0.” : Oswald Carter, the Vic. Rail-
ways refreshment-room inspector who caused
all the fuss recently by some alleged remarks
about the girls at an out-back station, was
a shipmate of mine some years ago when
he was staff-paymaster in the Dublin. In
those days he was a motor-bike fiend, which
perhaps accounted for his deficiency in
humor. He was regarded as an expert in
Naval Law and destined to become Judge
Advocate of the Navy; but something must
have gone wrong with the programme. Our
skipper used to allow Carter to do the inter-
rogation and cross-examining of offenders
and witnesses at the defaulter’s table. In
other words, he handed over one of the most
of an executive officer’s duties to
Carter. It was certainly a tribute to the
latter, but it made the rest of us boil with
wrath.
Harold Hitchcock, the man Geelong nomi-
nated and elected to the Leg. Council during
his absence in England, is one Whom “the
Hub” delights; to honor: on his'return the
other day by the Oronsay, aeroplanes
escorted the car which carried him from Mel-
bourne to his old home; the City Band and
a procession of cars greeted him outside rhe
town, and a crowd of 5000 cheered the offi-
cial welcome in the park—-a surprising ; re-
ception for a man of purely local fame. But
Hitchcock was five times Mayor, established
the Art Gallery, built up institutions of all
sorts, and, incidentally, opetj.ei|. many years
ago the seaside city’s biggest business. There
isn’t another town in Aiistrntfu'Avhioh has
been blessed with more “local patriotism”;
and of this cult Hitchcock is a sort of high
priest. - a V ;
In Melbourne for the Cup is that leathery
bushman, Mounted-constable McNamara,
from the Northern Territory. lie has been
30 years amongst the northern bingliis, and
takes a southern holiday once every reign
or so. It was McNamara, with M. C. Bris-
bane, who searched for the two white women
alleged to have survived the Douglas Maw-
son wreck. That no passenger from that
vessel ever reached shore is his opinion.
Andrew Petrie, “father” of the Queens-
land Parliament, has announced his inten-
tion of retiring from politics after 22 years’
service. Since his election in 1893 he has
seen 13 Premiers come and go, has caught
the eye of eight Speakers and addressed 14
Chairmen of Committees. Of the 72 mem-
bers of his first Parliament, 53 are dead
and 18 are out. Andrew is a descen-
dant of the pioneer and explorer of the same
name who came to Brisbane in 1837. John
Petrie, son of Andrew 1., was Brisbane’s first
Mayor (1859-61).
A Digger resident of the Sydney suburb
of Bexley, F. G. Girdlestone, is in a sort
of way related to Lord Nelson. His grand-
father, the Rev. Henry Girdlestone, married
a daughter of Susannah, Nelson’s sister. In-
cidentally, the hero of Trafalgar’s mother,
whose maiden name was Suckling, was de-
scended from Lady Mary Boleyn, a sister
of Henry VIII.’s Anne.
Among the members of the new Executive
Council of Norfolk Island for the ensuing
year are Eustace Christian (President) and
Charles Christian, direct descendants of
Fletcher Christian, one of the ringleaders
in the mutiny of the Bounty in 1759.
The Vic. Government has bought the rail-
way line between Moama and Deniliquin,
built by the D. and M. Co. upwards of 50
years ago. So the former town loses its
stationmaster, W. .1. Williams, who was the
first guard on the line. On one occasion,
while he was making the run from Denili-
quin with a train-
load of chequed-up
and inked-up shear-
ers and rou s e-
abonts. a fight com-
menced in one of
the carriages.
“Uncle” Williams
stopped the train,
ordered the com-
batants and their
backers to get out,
waited till the
scrap had been fin-
ished and then re-
sumed the journey.
What the other
passengers thought
of the incident is
not recorded, but
the D. and M.
trains* rarely ran
to time, anyhow.

Stonehaven.
N. S. Wales Opposition-leader Bavin holds
one queer record. He was Attorney-General
in a Government for one day—Dec. 20, 1921.
“Ex-R.N.” : The naval authorities have not
yet decided what to call the two new cruisers.
Cook and Flinders would be preferable to
most: that there is already an R.N. survey-
ing-ship called Flinders does not matter, for
the Admiralty would doubtless change her
name if desired. Failing these, Phillip and
Macquarie, after the early Governors, merit
consideration; or Barton and Deakin, after
the early leaders of Federation. But there
is little doubt that in the service itself names
which commemorate the navigators who
helped to put Australia on the map would
find most favor.
W. ,T. Code, senior member of the Vic.
Forest Commission, is to succeed Owen
.Tones as chairman. Code is a son of the
soil who in 40 years of civil-service life has
been forest ranger, forest field-officer, inspec-
tor and member of the Commission for the
last six years. He will remain as chairman
until he retires from the service next Octo-
ber. Alf Galbraith, who was first secretary
of the Commission, will become senior mem-
ber, and a new third member is to be adver-
tised for. Twelve months should give the
Ministry sufficient time to look for a worthy
successor to .Tones and make up its mind
whether the job is worth more than a thou-
sand a year.
“Geedla” : Queensland has no busier bag-
man than E. T. Shorley, who hawks his own
songs, which local composers have put to
music. Shorley believes that Mrs. Suburbs
is more often “in” at the back door than at
the front, so he chances the dog, and, after
a little friendly parley, excuses his rheumat-
ism, squats on the steps and lifts his voice,
without accompaniment, in his latest best-
seller. And he gets buyers, too. Queens-
land's Education Department, turned a deaf
ear to the proposition to put the stuff into
the schools. Still, hundreds of the little
information dens sing it lustily without
official hindrance. The poetry in parts is
bad and the melody worse, but the Austra-
lian sentiment carries the, hallmark.
One of the oddest changes of billet lately
known is that of a young divinity student
(Anglican) who was, till he entered a theo-
logical college, assistant manager in a lead-
ing picture-theatre in Adelaide. He cer-
tainly has ' the courage of his convictions;
he was getting £8 a week in the billet he
gave up, and it will be long enough before he
earns anything like that as a curate.
George Baldwin, who is to succeed Bruce
Ferguson as manager of the Aborigines’ Sta-
tion, Lake Tyers (Vic.), is a brother of the
State’s Go verb men t. Astronomer. The Pro-
tection Board picked him out of 271 appli-
cants, and was pleasantly surprised to get him
at the figure offered —-£350 a year, quarters
and rations. While planting in the north
of Bananaland Baldwin had a good deal to
do with abos. He has had a varied experi-
ence in commercial, mining and agricultural
pursuits, including a big job for years in
the Malay States, and is a Fellow of the In-
stitute of Secretaries. He is so favorably
circumstanced that he regards the post more
as a hobby than as a way of earning a living.
LONDON OR THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
High up on Hampstead Heath there stood one night
An Aussie soldier and a London girl.
Below, the city showed no gleam of light ;
.Across the sky they watched the searchlights whirl.
And she was fair, and he was tall and brown ;
And love ran wild those days in London town.
That night the land was very hushed and st ill;
A little breeze /was blowing warm and sweet.
They seemed above the world on that dark hill,
All London muttering about their feet.
And love was theirs by royal right of youth—
Love that was joy and song and hope and truth.
The soldier thought “My little home out back
In that great solemn bush, no neighbors nrar.
But seldom sees a traveller on the track.
She never would be happy there, I fear ;
She'd long and fret for all the life and whirl
That makes her London town, my London girl.”
Ten years have gone since then. Now he is back
In his old camp from settled places far.
Seldom a horseman rides along his track,
Not once a month he sees a motor-car ;
His phonograph whangs out an old-time wheeze
That ten years since ringed all the Seven Seas.
But he’° not lonely there, for hill and tree
And quiet, night and misty dawn of day
To those who feel are all good company,
Though man may be a hundred miles away.
The soft stars in his fair, far heavens gleam;
That girl and London now seem but a dream.
But she, still living on in London town,
Those muttering streets still crowding on her ears,
Often from Hampstead Heath stands looking down ;
And slow and weary pass the heavy years.
For lonely is that loneliness they know,
Who go alone where all these millions go.

In Melbourne for the Cup, “Charlie” Con-
nors, one-time woodehopping champion, blew in to
the Melbourne office of The Bulletin to recall a par.
of a couple of y'ears ago, in which a contributor
asked what had become of him. Connors has
performed some feats in ordinary' “chops,” but his
forte is long-distance events. On October 3, 1895,
at Zeehan (Tas.), he chopped 24 tons of wood in
eight hours without a stop against Hughie Jones,
whose previous record had been 20 tons. That
record, he says, still stands. Connors, who doesn’t
look old enough to have been making records 30
years ago, is a lithe, sinewy bushman, who still
keeps his axe sharp for his woodcutting job in
Gippsland.

“Caosar ’: The slaughter of marsupials in
Bananaland still goes on. Recently a hunter drove
into Linville, on the Upper Brisbane, his Lizzie
loaded with 1018 wallaby skins. Wallabies are
said to be still plentiful, but if this sort of thing
is carried on all over Australia it won’t be long
before they are as scarce as native-bears.

“Papi” : Are there such persons as earth-
quake psychists ? I know a Maoriland woman who
can feel earthquakes coming. She can tell that one
is coming at least a minute before the ground begins
to quiver. At night she will always wake up in
time to experience the shako, and she has often
surprised a crowded room with the startling statement
that a ’quake is on its way. I’ve never known her
to be wrong. Any explanations or similar cases?
* * * *
“Sig” : Read a story recently in a Sunday
paper of a mysterious station-bred racehorse being
treated with kangaroo or wallaroo glands and kept
dark for a big race, which he won with a peculiar
hopping action that enabled him easily' to outdistance
the field. One flaw in the conception—assuming a
horse could be kangaroo-glanded—is that the slowest
racehorse, or even a fast station hack, can head a
kangaroo on level country. Another is that such
treatment would be likely to reduce a horse’s speed.
It would tend to make him gallop high—in racing
parlance, “get up in the air.” 'Trainers often have
to train green horses for months to bring them down
in their action. But these authors’ inspirations get
past editors somehow,' arid perhaps it’s just as well.
“Larrapinta”: Corella Lagoon, on the
Barkly Tablelands, has been so named on account of
the countless millions of corellas which gather there.
\\ hen the water in the lake, which is about seven
miles long, dries up, the lignum bushes in the like
bed become festooned with the vines of the small
musk-melon. At sunrise the birds stream out., in
flights which resemble clouds for size and density, to
feed on these melons, and their deafening screeches
can be heard for miles around. They return to the
shore at sundown, and. although the lake is sur-
rounded with a thick fringe of coolabah trees, there
is not enough room on them for all the birds to
roost, consequently thousands camp on the bare
ground. Should, say', a prowling dingo create alarm,
the corellas on the ground take flight in screeching
mobs that make the night hideous.
“Feng-Shui”: A blood relation to Binghi
has been discovered by Dubois, who found the famous
ape-man some years ago. The new cousin rejoices
in the name of Homo wadjakensis, after the place
in which he was found, a district in Java near the
spot where the ape-man was located. The two
skeletons of H. wadjakensis resemble Binghi in all
particulars, but they have a more profiteering look
about them, owing, possibly, to the superior quality
of tropical living. This additional bit of evidence
tends to prove the now popular claim of the scientists
that Indonesia, the archipelago and peninsula north
of us, was inhabited by' Biriglii’s ancestors, who were
displaced by Mongols with 'better weapons and a
higher organisation.
* * * *
“Tabac”: The long arm of the law has
reached .into the heavens and plucked thereout a god
and invested him with the attributes of a persona.
Now, a persona in law is any entity capable of having
rights. In the Pramatha case, which has exercised
the wits of the Judicial Committee of the House of
Lords for some time past, the only way out of the
difficulty their lordships could see was to clothe
a deity with these mundane rights. It is true that
the god in question was only an Indian one, but
still he was a god—the household god of a family.
By the sacred law of the Hindu the patriarch of
this family was constituted as his religious guardian,
and had the custody Of' him in' the form of a more
or less presentable idol. The patriarch had it in
mind to give the god a change of air by removing
him from the family temple to his own house. To
this the other members of the family, being entitled
to the company of their god, demurred, and went to
law—-they are very fond of it in India. Eventually
they worried the matter into the Judicial Committee,
the final court of appeal, and there was much
scratching of legal wool before a solution of the
question was arrived at. The Committee at length
THE CHAMELEON.
“ Comrades, wage-plugs and fellow-serfs! Before I commence me
remarks, let us give three hearty cheers for the red” —
spots a policeman—“white and blue.”
determined that the deity was a persona, an entity
with a separate legal existence, like a corporate
bank or a joint-stock company, and before anything
further could be done he must be represented in the
proceedings by a guardian ad litem —-that is, for the
purpose of the legal proceedings, appointed to look
after his interests. Their lordships thought his
probable wishes should be consulted, so they sent
the case back to the High Court of Bengal for
re-hearing after somebody had been appointed to
represent the idol. How the idol is to pay the fee
wasn’t disclosed.

“Unacy” : Scene, a pub in the King Coun-
try (M.L.). Enter ranger, intent on snaring mis-
creant guilty of pretty considerable trout-poaching
on reserve. Finds Hene, whom he strongly suspects.
Opens casual conversation, skilfully leads up to sub-
ject, and gets a glow of enthusiasm from the unwary
one. Hene: “You come after te trout? Pv corry, it
te great game. Me, I get te cartload yesterday—
great big fella! Beau-ti-fool!” “Oh,” said the ranger
reflectively. “H’m ! You know who I am? I’m the
ranger.” “Oh, pv corry!” replied the victim, laugh-
ing jovially. “You know who / am? I te biggest
liar in te whole country!”

“Jim Carew”: The queerest auction sale
1 ever saw was conducted in the bar of a N.S.W.
North Coast pub. A crowd of us were there one
Saturday afternoon, when a hefty-looking stranger
walked in and announced that he was looking for
a job. Labor was scarce, and he at once received
about a dozen offers. Seeing that competition was
keen, the man got up on a form and said he would
auction himself. Bidding was brisk, and the price
soon ran up to 15s. 6d. a day. Ten shillings a day
was good wages in those times. The man who em-
ployed him afterwards told me he was easily worth
2 os.

“M. Mcl.” : Re breeding a black strain of
sheep (B. l/10/’25). , In his “Sheep, Farm and
Station Management,” E. 11. Pearse gives two in-
stances of wholly black flocks. One belonged to
Wm. Allan,’ of the Darling Downs. He noticed that
the purer the flock the more often black sheep ap-
peared among them, notwithstanding the culling of
every sheep showing a colored spot. He concluded
therefrom that probably the original merino strain
had been principally black. He therefore mated
black sires and black ewes, and in every case black
lambs resulted. The wool was remarkably good, and
in the opinion of the owner the black sheep were
hardier and more active than the white. This
wool sold in London in 1885 up to 181 d. per lb, —
considerably more than the average at that time
for white merino. Another and more recent instance
quoted is that of IC. P. Abbott, near Blandford
(N.S.W.). Both these men for their black flocks
selected only’ sheep which had a black tongue and
mouth. Figures given in regard to Mr. Abbott’s
flock are interesting. In 1911 his whole clip of
white wool averaged 10.46 d. per lb., whereas the
black averaged 10.58 d. In weight, too, the black
clip was a little superior. It is said that black
sheep fatten as well as white, and are equally
good eating, but that a black flock will not mix
for long with a white one. They soon go their
separate way. The rule for getting a black flock
seems to be “Cull on the mouth.”
* * * *
“Gagi”: Northern N. S. Wales graziers
are beginning to debit staggers in sheep and other
ruminants not to grass
but to soil. A double
experiment was carried
out two years ago.
Sheep from healtny
foreign stock were put
on staggery-grass coun-
try, and others far
gone in the trouble
were sent to untainted
pasturage. The healthy
sheep sickened and the
staggerers recovered.
Then three loads of the
noxious grass was sent
to three healthy
centres, which straight-
way became stagger
areas, and the case was
considered proven
against fodder. Now
an anonymous genius
has remarked that
sheep on none of the
three healthy experi-
mental areas have had
stagger outbreaks this
year. So that grass
seeds which must have
accompanied the viru-
lent fodder have either
not sprouted in foreign
soil or have lost their
toxin. An attempt is
being made by private
enterprise to cultivate
the scourge on a
healthy' experimental
area near Sydney, and
the outcome is eagerl.v
awaited by graziers out
of, as well as on,
affected areas, for if
the poison is in the
grass and it will trans-
plant, sheep travelled
from staggery belts are
to become an all-Aus-
tralian menace.
“Steel-butt” : There may be something in
what “S.R.” (B. 8/10/’25) says about spotted gum
not being suitable for axe-handles, but he is wrong
in saying that American hickory is the only wood
in the pile. I have never tried spotted gum, but I
know that the steel-butt of the Speck makes first-
class axe-handles. So does the she-oak ( Casuarina )
if you get a suitable bit, though that is not always
easy to do. Probably there are other Australian
timbers as good as hickory, but of axe-handles
from the two mentioned I speak from experience.
“Hop Toit”: “Nitric’s” par (B. l/10/’25)
re potato-tomato grafting reminds me of some experi-
ments 1 carried out in Gippsland. The first trial,
using the potato as the stock and grafting the
tomato, resulted in the plant bearing tomatoes above
and potatoes below ground. The second trial, using
the tomato as the stock, grafting potato and again
tomato, resulted in tomatoes being borne both above
and below ground. However, my object was not
THE GUEST OF THE GUVMENT.
“Your ’usband’s lookin’ well after ’is holi-
day.”
“Yes, ’e put on a pound for every month ’e

definitely accomplished till the third trial, when, on
grafting the potato to the tomato stock, I produced
an excellent crop of tubers above the soil, thus
greatly simplifying the work of harvesting, and also
a fair crop of tomatoes below. All the above can
be vouched for by the Rev. Jones (since dead).

THE TROPICAL FROG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In days of adventure, in seasons of daring,
Half-crazy with tidings of wealth newly-found,
Lnsettled and crowded with footsloggers faring
To fortune or famine on wheel-bitten ground,
Wherever a crowd in the wilderness mustered
To dryblow a gully or toil in a mine,
Wherever the tents of the vanguard were clustered
Around a bush publican’s tar-painted sign.
On nights of good cheer or in noons dull and drowsy
He’d slowly approach in the lead of his dog,
A battler, hard-bitten, familiar and frowsy.
Well known to the crowd as the Tropical Frog,
An outcast, adrift in the mulga, long fated
To tramp the uncivilised tracts of the earth,
With countenance bloated, and thirst rarely sated,
His little blue e.ves twinkled humor and mirth.
His stature was stunted, his waistline was ample,
He kept his condition through famine and fire;
And, just as the bee loves the pollen to sample,
To taste a good brew was his foremost desire.
Of course he would toil if an engineer pleaded
For someone to cross-cut or joggle a log:
But toilers were few when his presence was needed,
For scant.was the help of the Tropical Frog.
No matter how distant a camp was located,
He’d pay it a call if the country was new;
And always he seemed to be somewhat elated,
And seldom his outlook was hopeless or blue.
Hard toilers foregathered each evening to revel
Or brawl in the portals of somebody’s bar.
While Hampers and fossickers drank to the Devjl,
Then perished unseen in the scrubland afar ;
But always in sight of the cask he would linger
When others went mineward to shovel and slog,
Alive and alert for the 1 beckoning finger
That meant a fresh pint for the Tropical Frog.
HE GUESSED WHAT WAS COMING.
“Pull yourself together, Bill. ’Ere’s where
you lire.”
“Rio. Ring th' -hie — bell, an’ then — hie—
ring for th' ambulance.”
When Red Hill was booming a teamster unloaded
A handsome piano for Josephs one day.
Crowds drank in his bar till their throats were
corroded.
But nobody, sadly, seemed able to play.
Then Tropical crawled from his corner and slowly
Awoke the bright key's to a magic refrain
Which thrilled all who listened, and captured them
wholly
And brought them the fragrance of pasture and rain.
He sang in a voice true and tender and ringing
That set every heart with glad lilting agog,
Which sent care and sorrow on swift currents winging
And made a high priest of the Tropical Frog.
He played laughing melodies, songs tense with
passion,
The Moonlight Sonata and sy'mphonies rare ;
He made the thrush warble and winter seas crash on
Sharp reefs where the coastline is rugged and bare.
And sweet was his tenor that rose to the ceiling
And straight to their hearts went the polkas he
played,
Till crowds in the bar-room were daficing and reeling
And dense rose the dust as they shuffled and
swayed.
They' kept him at work while they filled him, with
kindness,
All treating him less like a man than a hog—
Bach heathen that night in the joy of his blindness,
Knelt long at the shrine of the Tropical Frog!
Play this, and play that—they each pleaded a
number,
Which brought a response that was pleasing to all.
They sang and they guzzled, regardless of slumber,
Nor did they respond to the mine-whistle’s call.
Men spoke to each other their knowledge concerning
His habits before he thus sprang into fame —
“By heavens,” they' said, “he has culture and
learning !
But where did he come from and what’s his right
name?”
Ah, all of his past, was a book sealed and hidden,
The future he faced with a swag and his dog,
Alert to partake of a quencher when bidden.
For that was the creed of the Tropical Frog!

The Fumo Dust Blower has been specially designed for its
application.
Mr. Gerald Massy of Gundaroo, N.S.W., writes:
“The Calcium Cyanide Dust and Blower
purchased from yourselves some time ago,
I have found very effective. I have been
using this on my lands since the purchase

“Nikko”: The old shepherd’s method of
keeping his meat fresh, mentioned by “Two Seas’’
(B. l/10/’25), is the same as that employed by the
Maoris in preserving mutton-birds. After a raid
on the mutton-bird islands the half-cooked birds are
put in a container and covered with a thick layer of
their own fat. I have seen bush housewives seal
pots of home-made meat-paste in the same manner.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: I simply don’t believe “Jim
Carew’s” young Australian who claimed (B. 8/10/’25)
to have yoked up 18 bullocks on his lonely. Even
had he been able to lift and hold the yokes—a strong
man’s business—he would still have been unable
to lean far enough over the near-bullock’s neck to
attach the bow to the offsider of the team-pair—a
job for which the longest bullocky usually finds
himself too short. Also since the invariable rule is
for bullocks to be refractory under the hated yoking,
it is only by dint of strong language, stubbornness
of purpose and much horn-rapping and neck-hauling
that the teams can be assembled. Again, the heavy
draw-chain, which a boy couldn’t raise from the
ground, had to be lifted over the bullock’s back and
held at far reach with the left hand, whilst the
yoke-ring was being attached by the right—a phy-
sical impossibility for a youngster.
“F.H.R.” : My mother, who saw a lot of
the blacks in the early days (when they were black,
and not half-caste), used to imitate for us the
corroboree music (B. 24/9/’25) which was produced
by the gins. It consisted of—“Bulla-ma-ling—Bulla-
ma-ling—la-ling-la-ling-laa.” This refrain was re-
peated to a soothing tune, and was accompanied by
the rhythmic whacking of the palm of the hand on the
empty stomach of a dog, thus giving it quite a
jazz-drum effect.

“Warooka”: The idea that the Northern
Australian and Pacific Island natives poison their
weanons by inserting them in putrefying bodies (B.
CHANGES IN HIS TIME.
TOURIST: “ Have you been here long?”
THE OLDEST INHABITANT ( bitterly offended ) : “Have I what?
See that 'ill —I was ’ere when that 'ill was an ’ole!”
l/10/’25) is erroneous. Spears and arrows among the
Island natives are poisoned by inserting them, point
downwards, in the taro patches, which teem with
tetanus bacilli. The tetanus poisoning does not de-
velop for seven or eight days. A mere scratch or flesh
wound is usually treated as of no consequence; thus
the tetanus bacilli have ample time in which to do
their deadly work and made treatment of no avail.
The bacilli of tetanus swarm in long-cultivated
and heavily-manured soils, more particularly in the
vicinity of stables. Our troops in the Great War
had tincture of iodine issued to them as the best
antidote. My authority for the statement that the
weapons are poisoned in the above manner is Prof.
Watson, a native of N. g. Wales, late head of the
School of Anatomy at Adelaide ’Varsity, with whom
I had many yarns regarding- his experiences in the
Islands.

“Robert Carew”: Within the last few
months the Shaky Isles have known a new type of
earthquake. Formerly the shakes came along in calm
and humid weather, but there have been many severe
shocks lately while gales were at their worst. After
a westerly in Wellington a shake generally comes
along now when the wind veers round to some ether
quarter—a thing hitherto unknown. Nobody has
explained it yet.
* * * *
“Canar": Of all the Pacific Islanders
easily the most musical are those inhabiting Arui,
between New Guinea and the Bismareks. Their pipe-
instruments give out notes which, though low and
soft, can be heard over considerable distances. At
night the bush resounds with their music, and often
a native will wander off by himself and sit for hours
making very fair melody. The Arui people are
practically the only ones in the Pacific who have
evolved any idea of harmony. The instruments con-
sist of a bundle or set of wooden pipes, each of
which has its distinct note. They do not, however,
seem to have got as far as composition, for with the
exception of one primitive tune —only a couple of
bars, frequently varied—-their music is just a series
of sounds made at the will of the player. Still,
they are far in advance of their neighbors, • the
majority of whom have no conception of harmony.
"Emel” : The abo.’s belief that an article
lie has often handled contains part of his person-
ality, mentioned by “Gouger” (B. 24/9/’25), is very
widespread. Not only do articles partake of his
personality, and so enable harm to be done to him
should they fall into a sorcerer’s hands, but his
blood, his hair, nail-parings, spittle, the leavings
of his food and in some cases even his name are
regarded by him as parts of himself. In West
Africa any blood dropped on the ground is stamped
out; any wood upon which blood has fallen is cut
away. New Guinea natives burn all bloodstained
articles, turn up the soil where blood has fallen,
and, if possible, light a fire on the spot. This fear
of sorcery led in Madagascar to a quaint occupation,
that of the ramanga, whose business it was to eat
the nail-parings and lick up the spilt blood of the
nobles. The practice of burying cut hair and nails
to prevent sorcerers using them is general in Mela-
nesia. in parts of Maoriland, Tahiti and elsewhere.
*' * * *
“Ratio”: “Sierra” says (B. 8/10/’25)
that I have unfairly compared Tokio with Hobart,
because “the northern town is practically bathed in
an Arctic current.’’ The most influential element
in the climate of Japan, from the north of Nippon
southward, is not a
cold current, but the
warm Kuroshiwo, or
Black Stream, the
northward sweep of che
north-equatorial Pacific
zurrent. It is to this
stream that the remark-
able climatic difference
between ehstern and
western Japan is due.
Taking Melbourne and
San Francisco as a
fairer comparison,
“Sierra” gives the Vic-
torian capital tha extra-
ordinary range of
7 4 deg., exceeding those
of Moscow (44deg.)
and Chicago (41deg.),
which have a typically
continental climate.
The correct Melbourne
figures are M.S. 66.5 deg.
and M.W. 50.0 deg.,
giving 16.5 deg., as
compared with B.sdeg.
at San Francisco, the
climate of which is
greatly influenced by
westerly Pacific winds.
From the sweeping
statement that, “lati-
tude for latitude, the
highest record rests
with the southern
towns,” no valid deduc-
tion may be drawn in
the absence of further
data; if the cliifiatie
factors of altitude,
proximity to the sea,
etc., are disregarded,
such comparisons are
futile. That the south-
ern hemisphere receives
a fiercier heat than the
northern has not been
denied; my contention
was that the south has a cooler summer than the
north.
* * *
“G.A.E.’ : Allow me to supplement the
information given by “Jarrah” (B. l/10/’25) regard-
ing the casuarina. His experience was in S.A. and
W.A., whereas my study of the family was in the
hills of Northern Vie. The casuarina is dioecious.
“Male and female created He them.” It is not correct
to say that the bull-oak is the husband of the she-oak,
appiopriate as it may sound. Here, at any rate,
there are male and female bull-oaks and male and
female she-oaks, distinguished by the catkin of the
male and the red flower of the female, the blossom
developing into the nut. There are no nuts on the
male plant. Economically there is a great difference.
The she-oak of both sexes is readily taken as food
by sheep and horses, probably also by cattle. The
foliage, if such a word can describe the hair-like
greenery of the tree, has a pleasant sub-acid flavor,
resembling that of sorrel. The bull-oak, whether male
or female, is here woody, dry and flavorless. No
stock will eat it. Its color also is less green than
that of the she-oak.
HER FLOWERING TIME.
SCHOOLNASTER (to class making farewell presentation to girl teacher) : “And, children,
later we hope to send oar dear friend a beautiful box of orange blossom. I
wonder what for?”
BULLET-HEADED BELL: “I know, sir; to put. on her grave, sir!”
“Two Seas’’: Here is a hint to the corres-
pondent who has difficulty in getting ewes to mother
their lambs. Put the ewe in a small yard with
her lamb, making sure it is hers; then upend the
lady and introduce her offspring to some nourish-
ment. Leave them together for a day or two if
necessary.
“W. Riverina”: Catch the ewe, and open the
lamb’s mouth and squirt some milk in, and the
baby will then suck straight away. Put the two
in a small pen, and there will be no more trouble.
In 24 hours they may go out with the rest of the
fioek.
“D. 8.0.”: In obstinate cases try placing the ewe
and lamb in a pen and put a trusty dog in with
them for a few minutes. This will stimulate the
maternal instinct.
“D. McG.”: Pen the ewe in the corner of a yard
in a space so small that she can barely turn round;
squirt the lamb all over with milk from the ewe’s
udder; put the youngster in the pen with her, and
see that she frequently allows her lamb to suck.
A few hours of this treatment, will not fail.
“Koolamarra”: Make a small Y-shaped pen with
a hurdle secured to a fence. Put the good lady
against the fence, and pull in the hurdle till she
is in a sort of loose vyce, with her head tow’ard
the narrow end. Place another hurdle behind her
to prevent her backing out. Then put the lamli
under her where the tucker-bag is. The lamb will
help himself whenever he feels inclined, the mother
being powerless to prevent the liberty, as she will be
unable either to turn round or run away. As soon
as her milk starts to pass through the lamb she
will claim him. She will identify her offspring by
the sense of smell.
“Wirrah”: After parturition, and keeping well
out of sight, push the latest addition under the
ewe’s nose and make her lick it. Leave her to
regain her feet without assistance. Do not attempt
to suckle the lamb: he knows his own way round.
* * * *
“H.L.N.” : The manager of a sheep-station
in the Ma State was puzzled when a ’phone message*
was repeated on to him to the effect that a gentle-
man would arrived next day “to inspect the rams
and water-rats.” A full parade of rams was easy
enough to arrange; but no census had been taken
of the water-rats. The inquisitive bunch of humans
that assembled to see the new variety of inspector
was thoroughly disappointed when it was revealed that
he was merely an official of the Water Conservation
and Irrigation Commission, with no burning interest
in water-rats or even in rams, but merely intent on
having a look at the dams and watercourses on
the property.
* * * *
“Spike”: Years ago in the Riverina, before
the ’roos were driven westward, the boss, a dour
Scot and an old campaigner, for a long time fought
a losing battle against the hopping plunderers until
he devised an ingenious scheme which completely
rid him of their presence. He arrayed himself in a
scarlet jacket of long-past military days, strapped
ii small bell round his neck, and, armed with
n huge blunderbuss, daily traversed the paddocks
on horseback. For a week he carried out his cam-
paign of propaganda, producing devastating effects
on the morale of the grass-pilferers. Flushed with
his first success, Scotty next yarded a well-conditioned
old-man ’roo, tethered him to a post, and with the
aid of a pole passed a noose over his hind legs.
Then, peeling off the scarlet jacket, he dexterously
slipped the ’roo’s forearms into the empty sleeves,
and, buttoning the garment securely across the chest,
affixed the bell to the victim’s neck, cut the ropes
and opened the gates. That night in our hut we
heard the tinkling of a bell far down in the scrub;
the sound was immediately followed by the thudding
of many tails and legs as the terrified ’roos loped
for safety. It was not till a month after the clean-up
that we came upon red-coat stretched out in a
glade. I think he must have died of a broken heart.
* * * *
“Akran”: It was at a little North Coast
(N.S.W.) town and just on 6 o’clock of a Saturday
evening. The bar was a seething mass of men all
trying to get served before closing time. The girls
were working like beavers when one would-be cus-
tomer made a desperate attempt to attract the
attention of the nearest barmaid. “Hey, Miss,” he
said, “’av’ yer ’eard about the mines?” “No.”
came back rather tartly, “and I’ve no time to be
hearing it now.” “Well,” pursued the thirsty one
hopefully, “you’re hearing it. Mine’s a beer.”
* * * *
“Werrimee” : A bird that seldom trots into
print is the emu’s first cousin, the cassowary of
the N.Q. scrubs. With its brightly-colored helmeted
head and blackish-blue or bluish-black plumage, it
is far more attractive than the emu. It lays the
biggest egg of all Australian birds, averaging 12iin.
in girth and 16in. round the ends —bright green with
a rough surface. The clutch varies from three to
seven, laid on almost bare ground. Male and
female share the job of hatching and rearing the
chicks.
* * * *
“Jimsey”: I was once on a Western
(N.S.W.) station when a swaggie, who called for
rations, was offered a job. “Let’s have a look at
yer dawgs first,” he replied. The dogs were whistled
up, and after looking at them he accepted work.
Later the boss asked what his idea had been. “Can
always tell what sort o’ tucker you’ll get at a place
by the dawgs,” was the reply. “Last place I was
at they was as thin as rakes, an’ so wus we when
we left.”
* * # *
“J.T.K.”: A couple of years ago I had a
wallaby-cat. I secured him when very young from
a man at Hodel, near Townsville (Q.), who picked
him up in the scrub. With careful nursing he
developed into an extremely intelligent animal. He
was the size of an ordinary tom-cat, black and white
in color, and possessed a bushy though short tail.
Something uncanny about him made the freak an
object of fear to dogs and cats alike. Seated erect
on his hind legs, he would box like Jack Johnson
with anybody and everything. His usual manner of
resting was to place his two little front paws
on the lower rung of an Austrian chair, and in this
position he would go to sleep. Music had a fascina-
tion for him. When the piano was played he would
indulge in kittenish antics, and usually ended up
by planting himself on the keys. I was offered
£5O for him by a travelling showman at Towns-
ville, but refused to part, thinking he would be
invaluable to the Brisbane Museum authorities. How-
ever, one night I found him lying dead at the front
steps of the house. He had been bitten by a snake.
ADJECTIVAL SONNET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When all the air was murmurous with b—s
And beer stopped short one hour before the morn-
ing.
Like laden vessels rolling in the breeze,
Men held the paths of rectitude in scorning ;
And on the midnight, gently homeward swaying,
They plucked up melody by all its roots,
Eternal friendship still their course delaying
Until they went to bed in street-soiled boots.
But progress with its heavy fingers throttles
The pubs where kindred souls were wont to mix;
And, somewhat sober, under loads of bottles,
The thirsty crowds are driven home at six.
And still the air is murmurous with b—s,
Where, ’mid suburban beer, men take their ease.

STOCKINS
lii N. S. Wales there are nearly a
thousand returned soldiers suffering from
consumption, and on an average one dies
every fortnight. It is to help them, as well
as all distressed Diggers, that Poppy Day
has been instituted. Hands that remember
have been busy making the 100,000 flowers
that will be sold on the 11th. One shilling
buys a poppy. Help the girl on your corner
to clear her tray.
As colorful as an Eastern bazaar, and
no Smell. That’s how the Girl in the Flat
Opposite describes this year’s Arts and
Grafts Show. The Education Gallery is
simply bursting with color, blues and rose
predominating, and everything —well, nearly
everything—that the heart of woman could
desire. Bryan Mansell is responsible for
a breathless alcove hung with shawls painted
and batiked in a riot of colors and an in-
tricacy of design, and bearing appropriate
and imaginative names, such as “Old Spain”
and “Arabian Nights.” Tortoise-shell and
red lacquers bring China nearer; Ada New-
man’s painted cups seem too dainty for any
but a Bagdad princess to drink from; hand-
wrought chains and rings and painted
brooches, fascinating baskets and flat enve-
lope bags in woven materials, trousseaus of
the finest stitcliery, polished and painted and
carved woodwork —such things abound on
every hand, and already the gallery, has
bought several pieces for the National Art
safe-deposit. Henry Braddon did the open-
ing, and the vice-regals visited the Exhibi-
tion quietly on Friday morning.
The Wentworth shrouded itself in gloom
and its patrons in sheets and ghoulish
pumpkin-faced caps to invoke the charms
and spells of Hallowe'en last Friday night.
There was no bobbing for apples, but there
were spooky lights and a masked fortune-
teller in the pah 1 court; also you got your
drinks on the coupon system, but they tasted
just as good as Christmas. Kind-hearted
witches and “little people” popped in and
out of the goings-on to weave charms for
good, and the band discoursed the old Scotch
songs, sentimental and pathetic, to tremen-
dous applause. Of course, the event of the
evening was the procession of white-capped
chefs bearing in amazing structures of their
art that were demolished in the twinkling of
an eye by the crowds of hungry dancers
around the mystic-favored tables.
The Ambassadors cooked its Hallowe’en
haggis on Saturday night, and preceded its
entry by the usual dinner dance. No shrouds
and pumpkin-heads here on the dancers —
just spot-cash-or-credit evening clothes. But
about midnight, when the theatre people were
dropping in for their week-end bite and jazz,
the skirl of the pipes was heard, and the
haggis was piped in with due solemnity.
Then came witches and cauldrons and
charms and spells in the guise of favors.
Mrs. .T. C. Williamson and daughter Tootles,
just home again, were the guests of the
Stewart Dawson couple.
The girls’ committee of the Sydney Hos-
pital Auxiliary splurged into its last effort
of the year in aid of the Macquarie health-
colony. All through the season this bunch
of bright and attractive girls has been com-
bining philanthropy with pleasure, and the
net total (without last week’s addition) is
something over £7OO. They named this last
beano the F'avor dance; but if any old-
fashioned swain thought he was getting a
favor for love—as in the days of crinolines
and cotillions and ringlets—he was dis-
illusioned when Miss Straiglitfrock and
Dame Shingle coolly demanded a price for
balloons and sunshades and absurd caps.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh went out to the
Palais and did the civic honors in delectable
blue and silver; and president of the
Auxiliary Mrs. Winn assembled shell-pink
satins and feathery ruffles. Valerie Britten
and May Matcliett were the night’s secre-
taries, and Bronzie Clonan and Clarice
O’Connor its treasurers. The dance was en-
riched by some beautiful blue feather
dresses worn by a group of dancers who
formed, as it were, a ball within a ball. They
were the Bluebird Club from Bebarfalds,
and it had been its members’ happy idea to
have their yearly dance for the hospital.
“Joey’s,” that training-ground for athletes
up the river, sent out an SOS for its play-
ing-fields a few weeks ago, and the result
arrived at the Ambassadors last week. The
Old Boys of St. Joseph’s engineered the
affair, and wives and aunts, sisters and
cousins wriggled into their most glittersome
neck-to-knees on the appointed night and
made for the ball. The Ambassadors wore,
the cerise and blue of the school; and
afterwards the insteps of many wore
the black and blue of the trodden-
on, if the crowded accommodation of the
dancing-floor was anything to go by. Mrs.
I. W. Ovens, who was president of the com-
mittee, shimmered in silver and grey sequins,
and Stella Maroney, the secretary-in-chief,
wrapped herself in the orange-gold glory of
sunset. Her oft'siders, Julie Murphy and
Elsie Corry, hid their fountain-pens under
frivolous wrappings of mauve and silver and
feather-ruched daffodil satin respectively.
J. O. Riordan and Brother Wilbred kept the
treasury.
Johnnie Pye coo-eed the Sydney that had
not already left for the Cup into the Gros-
venor Gallery in George-street one after-
noon last week. The occasion was a sort
of re-christening of the Gallery, which,
having been reglandcd, is now skippered
by John’s friend Adrien Feint. Art,
letters, society and one might almost
say vice-royalty (anyway, A.D.C, Captain
Coote was in the throng) were gath-
ered about the. teapot. Oswald Clieeke,
good-looking and even better tailored, and
Gilbert Hughes overtopped the other men
present; Ernest Watt, Bertie Kelly and
Sydney TJre Smith were among the fully
fledged; while among the nestlings were a
colony of commercial girl-artists, very well
turned out, as current rates of labor urge.
Mrs. Hachlan Beaton and Ruby Adams en-
riched the afternoon with stunning clothes
worn in the best manner, and Mrs. Sep
Levy wore a big hat and a frock in bois-du-
rose, like the red seen in Chinese glazes.
It was the nicest afternoon of the week.
Talking of parties recalls the, big flutter
that-the English-Speaking Union unfurled in
honor of Marie Narelle. Also the medical
Dan Kellys flung wide Warranilla to the
glory of the same popular singer on Satur-
day night.
The highbrows browsed in suitable pas-
tures on Saturday when the Vice-Chancellor
of the Uni. and Mrs. MacCallum beckoned
the learned and whoso had degrees heavy
upon him to meet Governor de Chair. Mrs.
MacCallum wore black georgettes with twine-
colored embroideries, and her top-dressing
was of black satin with an ostrich plume
coquetting on its brim. Edibles (etc.) were
spread in the Union refectory, and were
partaken of by Chief Justice Street, bridge-
builder Bradfield and others notable in art,
letters, medicine and law.
At the Mater Misericordise Hospital on
Sunday the Archbishop laid the foundation-
stone of a new wing. Dr. Dan Kelly, the
hospital’s wizard surgeon, stood by his Grace,
and the eyes of the newest probationers were
directed towards, him with as much rever-
ence as the representative of St. Peter in-
voked. The wing will cost £25,000, of which
£SSS was collected on the spot.
The Victoria League went gay on Friday
and filled the Women’s Club with glad rai-
ment and cheery smiles. It had two strings
to its bow, for, though the party was in
honor of the State vice-reine, when the wily
committee got her there it provided a task
for her —the presentation of prizes to stu-
dents of the Teachers’ Training College who
had won the English-speaking competition.
The successful ones were Kathleen Milligan,
Nancy Mcldrum and Evelyn Faith Pratt.
Elaine de Chair came with her mother;
Miss Macarthur Onslow did the honors, and
Mrs. Roystone Davey repatriated herself and
ran a sort of rival levee.
Democracy is closing around even the
Royal Colonial Institute. On Saturday
night its passages were trod by gay bands
of revellers that held (heigh lio for great-
ness !) not one knight or his lady. Artists
and art students from Dattilo Rubbo’s
studio next door were making merry—the
Atelier Club they call themselves, and dur-
ing the winter months they dissipate
monthly in lectures. On Saturday they
rocketed into carnival spirits and costumes,
and danced in the lecture-room of the R.C.1.,
and on its landing had a buffet supper
(the t was sounded, the space was so
small). Art-master Dattilo and his lady
chaperoned the young things, the youngest
of all being Rachel joy Morton, who came
with dad. Tall, vivid and long-haired, the
schoolgirl had her night of nights. Mrs.
Will Moore brought crinolines and a Dick-
ensy bonnet, and Mrs. Rubbo was fortune’s
favorite and chose the cap that bore the
lucky number. Charlie Bryant, Eric Lang-
ker and Roland Wakeline were also present.
Are fetes worth while? Ask Mrs. Donald
Esplin and Miss Rhodes, who worked for
the “Shore” afternoon. In the few hours
between lunch and supper £l5lB 2s. 2d. was
wheedled from the pockets of the visitors.
Mrs. Maclurcan, chatelaine of the Went-
worth, was asked by the committee to pre-
sent the cheque for £230 netted by the recent
cabaret for the Hospice for the Dying—she
had given it, lock, stock and barrel, and it
seemed fitting she should hand over the
fruits. Which same she did the other
morning at the hospice itself. And then, as
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh was busy at an-
other meeting, Mrs. Maclurcan was asked to
present the £lOOO ball-cheque to the tall
Hospice principal in her beautifully laun-
dered white. The black-robed head of St.
Vincent's was also present. Smiling posies
went to both Mrs. Maclurcan and Cecilia
Walsh,, who arrived later.
State Governor’s Elaine is to be a poppy-
seller on Armistice Day. What is more, she
is insisting on wearing a poppy hat. Actress
Ailsa Graliame —she sold poppies on the first
Armistice Day in London—Mrs. Osborne
England and Mrs. Leo Quick are others in
charge of areas. You can’t forget. The day
is November 11.
Marjorie Milson, only daughter of Arthur
Milson, of the old Ivirribilli clan, chose
Monday for her wedding night. “Monday’s
for health,” and Marjorie made doubly sure
by marrying Dr. Francis Thompson, of
Neutral Bay. The wedding raiment was
sumptuous, and included a frock of ivory
satin with crystal and diamente on its
frontispiece. The skirt was billowy and em-
broidered with American Beauty roses in
crystal. The accompanying train was a.
froth of transparent tulle and old laca
weighted also with crystal climbing roses. A
tulle veil, orange buds and lilies-of-tlie-
valley were a few more trappings of the
pretty, fair bride. Her. two maids added
skyey blues and primrose to the color scheme,
and after Padre Wright had recorded the
vows at St. Thomas’s, bride’s father did the
right thing in a gay marquee on the lawns
of the reel-street home.

and “The Flying Dutchman.”
Mick (Marjorie Mary) Ricardo, the
second daughter of Mrs. Arthur Street, of
Darling Point, slipped into St. Mark’s on
Saturday afternoon and promised William
Parkes, of Cattabynia (Q.), to have him for
better or worse. Padre A. G. Rix tied the
knot, and stepfather gave Mick away. She
had no bridesmaids, no veil and no train, but
sported instead a ducky lace dress, vellum
in tone, and a crinoline hat to match. A
great armful of red roses provided a splash
of color. Orme, the bride’s home, saw the
cake-cutting, Mrs. Arthur Street dressing in
rich navy blue with an outside posy of lilies-
of-the-valley.

sisters who came from Casino and started to

Town Clerk Layton, some musicianly folk
and crowded houses watched Elsie Peerless
dream that she dwelt in marble halls and
awaken to find herself a lady with bohemian
tendencies and many swains. Richard Mc-
Clelland and Charles Larsen —a Devilshoof
with the air of a pet sheep—helped to con-
vince her that Winslow Knight Thaddeus
was really responsible for her sudden return
to this earthly sphere. But it took some
persuasion on their part, even though they
invoked the aid of a never-ceasing piano
and a horde of gaily-decked gypsies. Balfe’s
“Bohemian Girl” brought with her a not
over-strong orchestra, but an active chorus
was more successful in making the pretty
story convincing in two renderings at the
Con. last week.
Kambala old girls and supporters rallied
in force at the Feminist Club on Saturday
night to help the school’s purchase fund.
Mrs. Osborne England was president of the
dance in black georgettes thickly sewn with
sequins; Miss C. Roseby, one of the popular
principals of the school, wore petunia bro-
cades with feathery embellishments; and the
big assembly-room was crowded with nice
frocks on nicer girls.
Convalescing, but still mourning a de-
parted appendix, is Helen Cousin, one of
the intrepid nurses of the Australian In-
land Mission. For over two years Miss
Cousin has been in charge of the A.I.M.
hospital in the cattle country of Kimberley,
and for the past three or four weeks the
Royal Prince Alfred has been her address.
Brisbane carries on :
At her third concert Dame Clara Butt’s adoring
audience overflowed on to the stage, almost to the
feet of the melodious giantess in cloth of gold.
Mdlle. Aussenae sat at the piano in black taffetas,
on which gold butterflies had settled, and Kennerlev
Rumford sang his usual air of domestic exaltation.
Joan Mary Elliot said she would to Otto Hirsc-h-
-feld in St. Andrew’s, South Brisbane. The Bishop
of Grafton tied the knot. An arch of palms and
white blossomry backgrounded the cream charmante
of the bride, who was given away by her father.
Innes Elliot and Kathleen Hirschfeld, in periwinkle
blue, with bouquets of roses, maided, and George
Mocatta best-manned. The National Hotel saw the
feasting, Mrs. Elliot wearing black georgette, and
handsome Mrs. Hirschfeld, sen., trailing amethyst
with a bunch of crimson roses.
For bride-to-be Evelyn Hutton her mother had a
party at the Bellevue. Water-lilies and pink lark-
spur decorated the daughter’s table, and pink and
blue larkspur the others. Mrs. Hutton was in black,
the bride-elect in cinnamon-brown, with nasturtiums
on her hat.
Lottie Sargent, just dead at 46, could claim 40
years of stage life. A brainy, plucky little woman,
she always got a rousing reception in this city.
At two hours’ notice on one occasion she took the
strenuous lead for another actress who was ill,
and went through without a slip.
Adelaide White, of New England’s girls’ school,
Armidale, fixed up a party at Lennon’s, where a
number of the old girls gathered to meet Nona
Dumolo, the present Head. Larkspur in blue
decorated the tea-tables. Peggy Dodds, Jean Love,
Nancy Lord, Mrs. G. E. Johnson. Mrs. Harold
Campbell and Mrs. L. J. Middleton were amongst
the Old Girls.
The Women’s Club entertained the majestic Clara
in a room full of roses. Mrs. E. B. Harris did
the welcoming. An inventory of the Dame included
a black gow’n over rose color, a black hat trimmed
with green, pink roses, a dagger, pearls and some
brown fox, to which was added a sheaf of pink
gladioli from Mrs. Ryder’s garden.
The Associate golfites had their meeting at Yee-
rongpilly this week. New members, said hon sec.
Mrs. Gilchrist, were galloping in; the membership
had to be closed at 200, and there was a “waiting”
list. Club-captain Miss Hood is champion of the
State, as well as club champion. Miss Baynes and
Miss Douglas hold the Macartney Cup. After three
ties with Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Petrie has the gold-
brooch trophy.
Adelaide’s hour:—
The passing of the wave of Press visitors has left
us high and dry. The staging of Italian Grand
Opera by Filippini ranks as our recent achievement
—and a very good achievement, too, worth more
support than our somewhat difficult public has given
it.
The Cards, by the way, who were outstanding
figures in the last local attempt at grand opera,
write from England of engagements at London theatres
and also at the Bournemouth AVinter Gardens.
They are due to sail for Australia early this month.
The Christmas treat for children of the City Mis-
sions, launched some years ago by Jean Gordon
and Janet Gardner, is now an annual and expand-
ing bloom. Hence a bridge party at the Town
Hall as a preliminary to this year’s feasting—-its
object, to raise funds, being admirably accomplished.
There has been a preliminary to “Yvonne” too —-
a tea dance at the Piccadilly arranged by Mrs. Lav-
ington Bonython, and with its proceeds earmarked
for the expenses of staging. Also a garden fete in
the Geoffrey Kyffin Thomases-’ garden at Medindie
landed an enviable cheque for the AValkerville Babies’
Home.
. This State learns with regret of the death of
Dorothy Goodfellow, whose stories of Chinese life
and customs have made her a host of friends. She
was born here in ’B3, but was still a tot when her
people moved to the Eastern States.
The Alliance Frangaise made Mrs. AVait its principal
guest at its final meeting for this year and backed
up a presentation by an ode composed in her honor.
Madame is one of our best-known and best-liked
teachei's of French, to whom the AUiance owes much
of its success.
Travelling scholarships are among the Society of
Arts’ dreams for the future. The annual report
estimates the sales at exhibitions of pictures in
the Society’s rooms at £3500, the exhibitors in-
cluding Blamire Young, Thea Proctor, Cumbrae
Stewart, AV ill Ashton, Mrs. Phillips Fox and
Auvergne Boxall.
Our AVar Memorial Drive has just been completed
after six years’ piecemeal work. It follows the
right bank of the Torrens from Gilberton to Bowden.
Glover, Mayor of Adelaide in 1919 (and again at
the present moment), gave half the £lOOO which
the first section, from the Zoo to the Oval, cost. The
lower and the upper sections, much less picturesque,
have been gradually laid out since.
The name of J. Matthew Ennis, former Director
of the Con. and Professor of Music in the Uni., has
been commemorated, a little tardily, by a brass tab-
let in the former building. The same committee
has also put up a memorial over his grave, and that
of his wife, who died a little earlier, in AVest-
terrace Cemetery.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
All Melbourne went holidaying on Tuesday ;
even the Sabbath-schools took gladly what
the gambling curse gave them. Flemington
was one grand picnic, with somewhere about
100,000 struggling for the crumbs the bookies
offered. The frocking was as varied as the,
cloudy skies, but a cool breeze brought out
the ensemble suit, and. routed the gay para-
sols and millinery of Derby Day. The cur-
tain-raiser was provided by the G.-G.’s arri-
val up the straight in the State carriage, with
postilions, outriders and a dashing Digger
escort. Lady Stonehaven wore beige geor-
gette beneath a cape of silver cloth and
topped it with millinery of coral pink banded
with velvet. Lady Stradbroke's black
draperies were cheered with a diamond muff-
ehain and a black-and-white hat. The Harbor
City’s representative led the vice-regal dress-
ing in bois-de-rose georgette and lace apparel
and a same-hued droop hat with mole feather.
Daughter Elaine topped cream embroidered
frocking with a flowered black hat. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers made a nice picture out of fawn
georgette gold-ribbon trimmed. And Lady
Helena Rons hid cherry-red beneath a black
coat. Marcia Allen’s rose and gold head-
piece was allied to a mastic gown, and Una
Woolf was meshed in a froth of golden-brown
georgette and crin. millinery. Mrs. George
Vivers topped white raiment with a jade-
green cape and mastic millinery. Among
the Harbor citizens were the Tony Horderns,
Mrs. Struber, the Hon, J. F. Coates, Ernest.
White, the Godhard couple and Mrs. Bullock,
the Falkiner pair and Morna MacCormick.
Melbourne began wearing its hat at a
giddy angle on Friday, when fine weather
encouraged a hurried shopping expedition to
secure race finery. Everyone appeared to
be shoeless —there was a Christmas Eve air
about the crowded footwear stores. Hatless,
too ; for well-trained husbands carrying mil-
linery boxes were steering their way along
Swanston-strect, while wifey followed with
the usual weekly pay-day purchases. Although
the emporiums complain that their model
gowns and hats are held up in ships’ holds,
beautiful frocks are being discovered some-
where. Fair Spring smiles, and so do the
shopkeepers.
A wonderful Derby Day it was. The sun
was radiant, bringing out from their cup-
boards and tissue-paper wrappings frocks
and hats as brilliant and ethereal as dragon-
flies. Such a colorful composition of green
lawns, roses draped on dividing fences and
beds of flowers everywhere—blossoms whose
colors were repeated in the gowning, hatting
and parasols. There was the new pink,
bois de rose, like unto the inner lining of a
button mushroom ; cafe an laii, beige ficelle
and champagne tones; sierra, the color of
Ihe moment, a sort of nutmeg; and pink,
from the amende to magenta. Dresses were
both very short and quite long, sleeved, short-
sleeved and unsleeved ; but necks were uni-
formly collarless. Capes—light, fairy things-
floated from many shoulders. Hats of pic-
ture mode aired feathers and flowers —
water-lilies white and gold seemed favorite
decking—and black and colored velvet ribbon.
And parasols—shades of Victoria, what a
day they had ! Things almost early-AVindsor
in style and size, with frills of val. lace,
black and white; painted, richly embroidered
and merry as a field of tulips.
Shortly before the first race there were
two servings of “God Save.” The first an-
nounced the arrival of the G.-G.. grey-suited
and bell-toppered, and Lady Stonehaven,
black top-dressed with coat of black and
white floral georgette wedded to a small
hat of petunia pink, and a black lace parasol.
The State Governor arrived with Lady Strad-
broke, who wore black lace and georgette and
a black crin. toque. With them were Lady
Helena Rous, who supported two blues in
organdie, Richelieu-embroidered, and a large
hat with mole feathers; Mrs. George Vivers,
whose gowning was a blend of champagne
and blue; Una Woolf, with black feathers
upon crin. millinery and black ; and Marcia
Allen, in floral chiffon and flowered hat.
Nora Currie received congratulations upon
her engagement to Captain Iveppel-Palmer
in a jade-green hat above pretty rose-pat-
terned chiffon.
The massed vice-regals sampled the Alan
Curries’ afternoon-tea under the elms, where
the hostess passed the sugar in ninon and
lace in. ecru tones and a black lace hat.
Mayoress Brunton flourished flowered blue
and a hat in tune with it; and Mrs. Frank
Clarke sported the new pink with monkey
fur and small chapeau. Large yellow and
pink roses climbed over Mrs. H. H. Smith's
brown georgette gown; and black with tra-
ceries of gold added to a black crin. hat was
worn by Mrs. J. A. Wallace. Wearers of
filmy gowning of beige shades included Mrs.
Leroy Burnham, Mrs. S. M. Bruce, Miss
Ella Outline, Mrs. .1. F. Ryan. Mrs. H. S.
K. Ward and Mrs. Ardle. Edna Thomas
concealed a blue frock beneath a silk-knitted
cape, and Mrs. Douglas Stewart was elegant
in lime and a halo of gold camellias. Perhaps
the prettiest and daintiest maiden was Mar-
garet Cumming, all pink crepe de Chine,
pink pearls and crin. hat suggesting cocoa-
nut. ice.
Among the Sydney immigrants were the
Thomas Hughes pair, she wearing blue mil-
linery with blue and grey patterned apparel;
Mrs. Fred Langton in white-and-black
striped satin speckled with rainbow tones
and harmonising hatting: Dr. and Mrs. Clay-
ion, she airing with ivory coat and felt hat a
red-and-white spotted frock; barrister George
Flannery, with Mrs. Flannery in black; Mrs.
Warwick Armstrong; Mrs.: J. C. Rogalsky
in biscuit-lined georgette; and Dr. and Mrs.
V. J. McPhee, whose fawn frock was topped
by a crinoline hat of hois de rose. Mrs.
John Maguey was a study in green and white,
and Mrs. Tony Hordern came in plaid maro-
cain in black, red and white, with a black
picture hat. Morna MacCormick wore fancy
ninori with black hat, and Mrs. Otway kah
kiner was in bottle-green marocain allied to
a black headpiece.
Fashions for men were shown by lately-
returned Charles Ryan and Ernest Keep,
who favored nigger-brown attire. Frock-
coats and bell-toppers included several all-
grey turnouts. A sensible visitor wandered
hatless around the lawn with a huge white
umbrella lined with green. And Priminister
Bruce had forgotten his spats!
Cup festivities at State Government
House ran to a dinner-party and reception
on Monday night. Navy, military, profes-
sional and social leaders were of the bidden ;
and the viee-regals alone made a good-sized
party. The G.-G. brought Lady Stonehaven,
in flame georgette, diamente embroidered,
with a feather fan of the same hue. With
Sir Dudley was Lady de Chair, wearing pea-
cock-green velvet, trimmed with jade geor-
gette, much beaded, and opal-fire danced in
her coiffure; daughter Elaine was in gold
brocade. Sir James O’Grady, of Tasmania,
brought daughter Margaret, who had bois-
de-rose covering; her gown was beautiful,
and was worn with a nice display of jewels
and hair adornments. The guests shook
hands with the Stonehavens as well as with
Governor and Lady Stradbroke, whose cling-
ing black draperies had relief in crystal em-
broidery and tassels, a necklace of pearls
and diamonds and a hairband of silver.
Melbourne sent a squad of knights—the
Robert Garrans, Robinsons, Henry Mauds-
leys and Edward Mitchells. Mayor Brunton
was accompanied by his Mayoress in
black lace over gold tissue. General
Chauvel’s lady glittered in flounces of
crystal frange; the Thomas Hughes dame
was in ombre and light-brown georgette, gold-
beaded ; Mrs. Godhard wore her presentation
gown of white with a tunic of latticed silver
beads; and Mrs. George. Vivcrs was white-
clad, the gown edged with a trail of beaded
roses. Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers sported some-
thing very handsome, rose-shaded and gold
brocade ailied to black georgette. The draw-
ing-room was a study in pink roses and white
watsonia; and American Beauty roses trailed
over the supper-table.
Much *of the success of the recent effort
for the Girl Guide movement was due to
the genial per-
sonality o f
Lady Strad-
broke. Vic-
-1o r i a’s vice-
reine is so
engaging that
she lured soci-
ety into such
enth u siastic
action that it
raked in a
couple of
thousands or
more for the
cause by tin*
frivols at Fed-
eral Govern-
ment llyiuse
the other day.
And that is
only one of
her activities;
she lias such
wide sympa-
thies that she can interest herself in almost
every social-welfare movement. Besides,
she is a thorough good sport who loves a
plucky horse and a straight run. Lafayette
made this picture of her in the rig of a
Girl Guide —she holds the office of State
Commissioner.
The announcement of the engagement be-
tween Captain C. M. Keppel-Palmer, seere- :
tary to Governor Stradbroke, and Nora
Currie, daughter of the late Sibbald Currie
and of Mrs. Sibbald Currie, of Ettrick’s
broad acres, occasioned no surprise. In ordi-
nary parlance they have been “walking out"
for some time. ■ The lass, who is in town
for the races, is trousseau-buying for a day
in December.

Sturley, whose coloratura soprano may place

Lady Stradbroke had her feminine curi-
osity aroused by a letter she got the other
day covering a donation of half a guinea to
the recent Girl Guide effort. The letter,
in adult list, opened familiarly, and breezily
concluded “With love, cheerio. —Harry" ;
plus sundry crosses. The Countess told the
joke at the reckoning, at the Town Hall
when £2700 was proclaimed as the net pro-
ceeds of the rally, with more returns to come.
St. Hilda Town Hall was prinked up with
crimson and royal blue for the ball given
by president. John Monash and members of
the Naval and Military Club “to meet Colonel
the Right lion, the Earl of Stradbroke.”
The G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven and Gover-
nor O’Grady (Tas.) were feted also. Her
Ex. joined the dancers waving a single
green-plumed fan over frocking of lime tone
with fringe of bronze beads ; there were dia-
monds and emeralds in her coiffure. Mrs. Pitt
Rivers was attractive in ivory chenille-em-
bossed georgette, sprinkled with silver
p'ailettes. Margaret O'Grady wore tomato-
hued velvet; Mrs. George Vi vers was
sheathed in ivory crepe romaine, and Miss
Gillette was frocked in black lace. General
Monash’s daughter, Mrs. Gershon Bennett,
hostessed, in silver and blue brocade, with
tulle flounces. A dash of crimson mess uni-
forms and a trimming of gold braid enhanced
the imposing procession of official guests,
headed by four stalwart aides.
Mrs. L. F. Mcßean handed over her South
Yarra home to her daughter, Mrs. Reginald
Egerton, for a Derby Eve jazz, at which
Sydney’s smartest vied with Melbourne's in
a ballroom all arum-lilies and broom. The
hostess wore a gown of pale pink bead-em-
broidered ; and Lady Helena Rous, wearing
an Oriental red frock with gold fringe, was
one of the dancers.
The Toorak home of the William Par-
burys made an effective setting for a dance
for the younger set. Daughter Betty, who
budded during American Fleet Week, was
one excuse for the party ; Cora S powers. all
petal flounces of pale pink and bead em-
broidery, the evening’s deb., was another.
The hostess glistened in black georgette,
pailettes and jet. and Betty was in apple-
green crepe, gold lace and pink blossoms.
Tonings of the fall of the leaf with beading
in red and crystal was Dolly Parbury’s
choice ; and Mrs. Roy Parbury, daughter-in-
law of the hostess, was a jazzing delphinium.
Made and manned by Chinese, the now
steamer Changte, of the Australian Oriental
Line, celebrated its first arrival with a lunch
one day and an afternoon tea the next, Cap-
tain F. Gambrill and John Sanderson and
Co. doing the honors. Though the sun beat
fiercely, visitors rolled up in force, and the
energetic younger sot even danced to the
music of a string band, while cool-looking
Chinese boys flitted around in white linen
and Oxford bags. Jazz-caps, bonbons and
balloons made festive array for the tea-
tables, flirtatious couples finding three bal-
loons sufficient screen for two heads. As
for the floating village, accommodation for
over 50 first-class passengers includes two
de luxe suites, with sitting-rooms and bath-
rooms, many • one- and two-berth cabins
equipped for all weathers, and a music-room
and lounge panelled in pink and buff and
upholstered in grey and rose brocade.
Patrons of the recent matinee at His
Majesty's to aid St. Vincent’s Hospital
appeal wondered why there was no passing
up of vegetation over the footlights. Truth
to tell, there was about £2OO worth, but
somebody had blundered—it was forgotten,
and the tip received it. The bottles of fizz
sent for the nigger minstrels also took the
wrong turning; but not to the flowery grave.
Offer our sex a chance to “meet" a popu-
lar actress and we’ll come out in any sort
of weather. Marie Burke, in reseda crepe
marocain and biscuit georgette with harmo-
nising millinery, was the lodestone that
crammed the Austral Salon on a recent
torrid Monday. Songbird Jocelyn Sturley.
who will warble through a programme at
the Queen’s Hall next Saturday, bestowed
greeting and tea on the company in a frock
of jade green with touches of rust hue.
topped by a black picture hat. An honored
guest was Marie’s mother. Mrs. 11. O. ruder-
wood: and the party also included Dickens
reciter Clement May and his wife.
A flutter was caused by the announce-
ment of the prospective linking of dainty
Nellie Payne, of “The Street Singer" cast,
and Lambert Latham, whose pasture lands
are in N. S. Wales.
Pauline Curran, the Tasmanian beauty
who has just come back from a tour abroad
with her mother, was the observed of a bat-
tery of eyes on Derby 1 >ay, when she had
her Russian refugee Prince in attendance.
The graceful maiden is shortly to wed Prince
Maxmilian Melikoff. The future Princess’s
father, the late J. B. Curran, made his little
bit in Tatt.’s consultations.
The other afternoon Freda Latham bor-
rowed her parents’ home at Malvern, and,
with Janet Ballantyne, engineered a fete
for the Children’s Hospital, the school-
girls’ enterprise returning over £lOO protit.
Young Australia showed business ability by
specialising in fancy articles for Christmas
and in running a tennis tournament. A
pretty interlude was supplied by the eurhy-
thmio movements and tripping of scholars
from Strathern, Hawthorn.
Mrs. Roystone Davey, of Sydney, back
with her husband from a six months’ viewing
of foreign parts, found glad welcome waiting
at Mrs. Ross Fenner's St. Ivilda home. The
returned traveller, a former Melbournite,
covered black frocking with a musquash
coat, and feathers trekked over her satin
millinery. Mrs. Edwin Millar, Mrs. Bowes
Kelly and Mrs. Edward Newbigin were of
those who gave the guest of honor cncd mille
foil the.
The A.B.M. tearooms in McEwan House
held the cafe chantant arranged by the
Women’s Auxiliary of the Australian Board
of Missions, which works among the brown
folk of Papua, the South Seas and the North-
ern Territory. Takings were considerably
supplemented by sales of flowers; and few
could get past the bunches of lily-of-the-valley
at the stall where Mrs. W. Marshall and
Mrs. A. O. Morley did sentry duty. There
was music; and, later, Canon Snodgrass,
who was accompanied by his wife, gave
thanks to the artists and the helpers, and
pleaded for further recruits to the Women’s
Auxiliary.
Though the rain pit-patted outside, beneath
Mrs. Dudley Trenchard’s roof it was spring
when the lady, a daughter of Mr. H. M.
Collins, president of the Alfred Hospital,
passed tea around to a string-orchestra’s
accompaniment. The party was a reunion
of the hostess and many friends after her
long absence in foreign lands. She dressed
her part in draperies of brown and beige
crepe georgette with harmonising crin. straw.
Daughters Joan and Betty flitted round in
summery frocks • and since visitors could
not wander in the garden, the garden came
in to them —the dwelling held all the glory
and perfume thereof.
Brahms was given a turn, instrumentally
and vocally, at the Artists’ Society Galleries
one day last week by pianist Rita Hope,
violinist' Margery Gray and Violet Somerset,
contralto of the Music Club. The instru-
mentalists are artists who add weight to
Melbourne's small world of fine performers.
Rita Hope wore beaded hydrangea blue with
gold foliage on the shoulder, rhinestones
and diamente prinked up Margery Gray s
white satin, and Violet Somerset projected
her bright notes out of a white cloud spark-
ling with opalescent sequins. A full house
gave the trio warm encouragement.
The popular J. B. Levis were bidden to
a party to celebrate their just-concluded reign
as St.'Hilda's civic heads. The local Town
Hall heard the rejoicings when chairman
Henry Barnett passed over a diamond clus-
ter ring to the ladv and a pair of binoculars
to Mr. Levi. Mrs. F. Chamberlin, wife of
the Town Clerk, shared in the distribution to
the extent of a crystal rose bowl.
The acting-Mayoress of Fitzroy, Mrs. F.
B. Suing turned her first reception to good
account by supplying tea and music in aid
of St. Vincent’s Hospital appeal. An Ener-
getic committee lent its help, and bonme
maidens passed the cup and bun around.
The recent Girl Guide effort at Federal
Government House benefited by £2O through
the auction of a doll-cosy handed over by
Edna Thomas, the lady who created a corner
in negro spirituals in these parts. After
her concert she went to the evening's dance
and took the bids herself.

Frigidaire —the Electric Refrigerator—is the com-
plete solution of the Summer food problem, for
not only does it preserve perishable foods almost
indefinitely, but food actually improves in quality
in the keeping.
In country districts particularly much meat is eaten
too soon after being killed, and in consequence
is tough and unappetising, Vegetables and fruit
lose their flavor and rot, and salad greens are
flabby and wilted. Frigidaire changes all this;
meat may be hung as long as desired, vegetables
are kept perfectly fresh, and fruit and salads
acquire a delicious crispness.
Frigidaire has all the advantages of the ice-chest and many more,
but it lacks its disadvantages. Gone is the ice-chest smell there
is no heavy, muggy air to taint food and spoil its flavor, but rather
a dry healthy atmosphere, cold, clean and sweet, like the breeze
from snow-clad mountains.
Now is the time to install Frigidaire—now, before the hot days
make the housekeeper’s life a burden with the worry of wasted food
Summer health and comfort depend largely on carefully-prepared
food—pure, fresh and untainted.
Frigidaire is an investment which will appeal to everyone.
Frigidaire is the latest production of the Delco-Light Com-
pany —a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation.

NOTIONS
In the history of the Victoria Derby,
which goes back to 1855, there has never been an
easier victory than that registered by Manfred at
Fleniington on Saturday. He not only won by an
unprecedented margin but clipped If sec. off the
previous best time —Frances Tressady’s in 1923. As
at Randwick, Ben Ohaffey’s’ chestnut stood right out
from the other six starters, who were a very ordinary
lot. He was 3to 1 on most of the time, but towards
the close of operations 5 to 2 on was accepted, what
time Belgamba was 10 to 1 against, Amounis 14’s,
Manacre. Petunia and Ethelton (the only filly in
the field) 15’s, and Hampden 33’s. Manfred had
No. 2 position at the barrier, and after a momentary
flash of temper, jumped away kindly for Dempsey,
who has taken Duncan’s place in the saddle, but
Ethelton was permitted to set the pace. At the
of the course the S. Aus. filly was throe
lengths in front of the favorite, who was followed by
Manacre, Belgamba, Amounis and Petunia. With
five furlongs to go, Manfred ran past Ethelton in
a couple of strides, and turned into the straight three
lengths ahead of her. with Amounis, Belgamba and
Hampden next and Petunia tailed off. Galloping
beautifully and going further away, the Valais colt
ran past the judge a dozen lengths in front of
Poitrel’s son, Belgamba, who outstayed the others,
with Hampden two lengths away third, Amounis
fourth, Manacre and Ethelton next, and Petunia a bad
last. The time, 2min. Slisec., equalled Comedy
King’s course record and was the best ever established
in a Derby, Australian or English. It was certainly
a great gallop, and great were the cheers.
The Melbourne Stakes had . an unexpected resu’t,
but it was a very, exciting race —the best of the
day, in fact. There , were five starters, and Windbag
was always at od.ls on—-2 to 1 at first, and then
6to 4. Heroic was well backed at 4 to 1 against,
and Whittier was at s’s, Pantheon 12’s and Pillie-
winkie 15’s. Windbag, who looked in great fettle,
was unfortunate enough to have Heroic next to him
at the barrier, and the erratic chestnut was in a
nasty mood. When the machine lifted the pair lost
about three lengths. Pilliewinkie moved away
first, but Whittier dashed to the front, and at the
mile post was two lengths ahead of Pantheon, with
Heroic and Windbag next anil Pilliewinkie last.
Windbag ran past Heroic and was in third place
with five furlongs to go; it looked then as if he
would win. Whittier led as they turned into the
straight; Pantheon, Windbag and Heroic were next
and Pilliewinkie still last - but the Caulfield Cup
winner had had enough at the distance and Pillie-
winkie, coming with a great run, passed the lot
of them, finishing a neck in front of Pantheon, who
improved greatly on his Sydney form, with Windbag
half a length away third, Whittier fourth and
Heroic a length behind him. It was a fine perform-
ance on the part of the M.L. gelding, but Windbag
had all the bad luck that was going, not only
at the start, but also at the turns, where he ran
wide. The records also show that Poitrel (in 1920),
Westcourt (1917), Piastre (1912), The Parisian
(1911), The Victory (1907), The drafter (1898)
and other Melbourne Cup winners W'ent under in the
Melbourne Stakes. Nevertheless, Windbag was weak in
the Cup betting after the race. Pilliewinkie ran
the 10 furlongs in 2min. 4sec„ a course record.
In the betting on the Maribyrnong Plate, a little
even money was laid against Rampion, but he soon
lirmed to 2 to 1 on, and very little of that. Bright
Star (s's), with Duncan on top, was the only other
backed for money; Sarpedon was at 15’s, Duchess
of Blankney Id's, Kanoonka 20’s, and the others from
20’s to 50’s. Rampion drew the favored outside
position, and, jumping into his stride beautifully,
was soon in front. Leading all the way, the flying
Rossendale-Royal Pet rolt ran home an easy winner
nearly three lengths clear of lvanooka, with Cyden
(20’s) third. Despite his 9st. 61b. (he had a 10lb.
penalty), he galloped the five furlongs in 59lsec.,
which is half a second faster than the previous best
time established by Heroic two years ago in winning
the same race. Rampion is trained by F. Williams
for J. E. and C. H. Brien, who bred him. lie
will always be a smasher over a short course, but
the offspring of Royal Pet have hitherto failed as
stayers.
The Night Patrol, his lOst. notwithstanding, was
favorite at 3’s for the Cantala Stakes, Baldwin
being at 6’s, Fujisan 7’s, Mercian King 10's,
Blackadder, Metellus, Boaster and Perspective 12 s,
Chatterbox 15’s and Waranton 25’s. The last-
named hit the front soon after the start, and stayed
there; he lasted just long’ enough to win by a neck
from Baldwin, who struck trouble on the journey
and w T as unlucky to lose, with Fujisan (last into
the straight) third. The Night Patrol looked like
having a chance at the turn, but the weight was
too much for him, and Boaster and Chatterbox
shaped respectably without ever flattering their sup-
porters. Waranton, an old stager by St. Anton-
Warrain, was thought to be racing out of his class
and beyond his distance, but he carried Bst. 51b, and
galloped the mile in Imin. 38|sec. He is owned by
it. and G. Chaffey, and is trained by E. «T. Riley.
Frances Tressadv, although she had 9st. to carry,
was always favorite for the Hotham Handicap, 12
furlongs, and finished up at 3’s, with Royal
REN CHAFFEY, owner of Manfred and
Whittier; and Harry McCalman, his
trainer.
Charter and Raith at 7’s, Virgin Gold and Friars-
dale B’s, Solidify (well backed) and Accarak 10’s,
and the rest from 14 s to 2d s. Friarsdale made
most of the running, and sailed into the straight
with a nice lead, but King of Mirth (15 s), finish-
ing in great style, beat him home comfortably by
a length and a half, while Frances Tressady, who
had been last most of the way, was a fast-finishing
third; time, 2min. 32isee. King of Mirth, who
seems to like Flemington—-he won the Stand Handi-
cap at the V.R.C. October meeting—gave Dempsey
a winning double. He is owned by the South Aus-
tralian R. K. Hope and is trained by L. J. McCann.
Those who went off Windbag because of his Mel-
bourne Stakes defeat regretted it when they saw the
gallant son of Magpie and Charleville win the 65th
Melbourne Cup or heard that he had won it. After
a magnificent race, which had the enormous crowd
on its feet throughout, Windbag beat Manfred by
half a length, the colt being the same distance in
front of R ill i e wink ie. Manfred w r as favorite at
i to 4, Windbag second favorite at s’s (he had
touched 8 to 1 on Monday) and Pilliewinkie next
in demand at 6’s; it was 15 to 1 (Frances
Tressady and Tookarby) bar the three ' and
25’s to any price the others —there were
28 starters. The time was 3min. 22}sec.
yet another race record; Bitalli’s 3min. 24]sec.
was the previous best. Very few Sydney people lost
faith in Windbag after his failure on Saturday. He
had been a strong Sydney fancy ever since the
declaration of the weights. As in all his Randwick
races the resolute bay was ridden by Munro, who
understands him perfectly, and Robert Miller, the
owner, will receive a V.R.C. cheque for £10,215,
of which a substantial proportion (10 p.c. is cus-
tomary) will doubtless go to the Randwick trainer,
G. Price.

“H. Hardupp”: Derby Day’s most disgusted punter
was one who, having torn up a bundle of betting
tickets and scattered the fragments, extended a
derisive arm towards a horse that was toiling at
the rear of his field. “There it is!” he laughed,
mirthlessly. “Wish I’d reckernized it before I
put me money on. One of Sleigh’s ole ’earse-’orses
before ’e took to runnin’ motor funerals!”
When the betting opened on the Mari-
byrnong Plate, a Rampion punter was jambed by tlie
crowd against a bookmaker whose price was 2 to 1
on. “You’re dynamite, Ike}',” gasped the indignant
bettor. “They're yellin’ evens the field over there.”
“Go over t’ them mugs an’ grab it, then,” the
book snapped back. “I would quick an’ lively if I
could get through the mob,” rejoined the punter.
“Well,” howled Mae Aaron, “ ’op on me back an’
I’ll gallop yer over.”
“Ex-Dig.”: The discontent, of the man I met on
the Flemington stand puzzled me, as he looked like
one who had nothing to grumble about. “Losing a
bit?” I asked. “Not at all,” he replied in surly
tones; “won over 60 quid.” I was just about to
tell him, with a laugh, that he ought to be happy,
when he exploded. “What’s the use of it? They
call this a public holiday, yet look at all the wives
poor blankards have had to bring with them!” An
imperious woman beckoned him from below with
her parasol, and as I saw how hastily he forsook
his good “possie” and forced his way down to
join her, I understood.

Imported Sands of the. Orient was not
much good when he raced in Westralia, but he has
sired a lot of decent gallopers. One of them is the
five-year-old bay gelding Freddie O. (4’s), who,
nicely handled by Tommy O’Bryan—a jockey not
often seen in the saddle on metropolitan courses
nowadays—won the 10-furlongs Rosehill Handicap on
Saturday for G. Cridland. Little Lucy Thrice (9 to
2) made a brave attempt to repeat 'her Randwick
success, but Freddie O. was going away from her
at the finish. Gulgong (s’s), who had a stormy
passage, was third. An interesting competitor in
the Nursery Handicap was Gloaming’s Sister—a
bay, like her famous brother and the much less
famous Hare Hatch. Solidly backed at 3’s, she
met something too good on the day in the Beaufort
-—Chantily filly Clarbeau, but she showed courage
when tackled and is the makings of a respectable
plater, at least.
The Queensland Government proudly an-
nounces that the Golden Casket lottery made a net
profit of £168,980 for the year ended June 30.
The total profits from the Golden Casket for the last
five years (1920-25) amount t’o £897,878, with an
extra £20,993 for interest. The money is devoted
to such purposes as grants to hospitals ( £679,398 to
date), baby clinics, maternity wards, kindergartens
and various charitable institutions. The Golden
Casket, is practically a revenue-producing department,
supervised by a Minister of the Crown and staffed
by Government nominees. The Government levies a
tax of 3d. on every lottery ticket. For the year
ended June 30 the taxation paid by the Golden
Casket (Federal and State) amounted to £48,750.
The Federal tax on lotteries has now been abolished,
but the State will continue to take its cut. Apart
from the Golden Casket and minor lotteries, the
Queensland Government drew £100,194 from direct
taxes on gambling (totalisator and betting tax) for
the last financial year. It takes 5 per cent, of the
totalisator receipts, leaving the race clubs and the
tote company to cut up 8$ p.e.
* * * *
The gods of chance looked cross-eyed on
Danny Frush (9st. 61b.) at the moment when he
had Bert McCarthy (9st. 81b.) hopelessly beaten at
the Melbourne Stadium on Saturday. For two rounds
and the greater part of the third Daniel had been
showing exactly what a real fist expert can do to
a pillow-fighter. Then he dropped Herbert like
a log with a wicked right. Bert took nine seconds
to consider matters, and, rising groggily, fell right
into a lifting right which Frush was providing for
his finish. Disqualification had to follow an un-
intentional foul, the only possible way in which
the unlucky Frush could have lost.
* * * ♦
At the end of the fifth round of tlm
Sydney Stadium contest between Paul Dcmsky and
Elino Flores (9st. ] 1 Alb. each), the Filipino, turning
away at the “cease-fire” bell, tottered, fell, and rolled
over unconscious. To those who had seen poor Demio,
Flores’ countryman, sink slowly to his knees, smiling
a brave apology, in the 14th round of that terrible
fight with Criqui, some four years earlier, and
remembered his pitiful end in a Melbourne ring a
few weeks later, the collapse of Elino appeared
tragic and not a few took their departure without
waiting for the emergency bout. It had been a
hot five rounds, with Paul always doing the better
work —these swingers suit him —and Flores had taken
some heavy punishment, but not enough to account
for his sudden and ominous collapse. The Filipino
is not likely to be matched again in Australia.

“Hamer”: Stadiums, Ltd., lias given us
one immigrant, at least; Peter Limutkin has decided
to settle in this country. The amiable mass of muscle
intends to wrestle with 40 acres of land near Franks-
ton (Vic.), where, of course, he will always be handy
when the Stadium people want a spare grappler.

A team of Westralians captained by
Harold Rowe —-a well-preserved veteran who once
made a century against A. O. Jones’s Englishmen—
began a tour of the effete East at Adelaide on
Friday. The South Australians beat them by an
innings and 281 runs, but their fielding was at
least equal to that of their conquerors, and their
batsmen will do better when they grow accustomed
to the fast Eastern wickets —their own are consider-
ably slower. They have two decidedly promising
youngsters, ,in Bryant, who made 25 and 65
against the bowling of Grimmett (5 for 60 and
5 for 62), Scott (4 for 104) and Wall (4 for 80),
and Inverarity, who bagged six good S. Aus.
wickets for 179. Only 17, Inverarity bowls medium
pace and keeps an excellent length. He got his
wickets at no great cost after the opening pair,
Arthur Richardson (227) and Lance Gun (129) had
put on 313 —a first-wicket record for S. Aus. The
scores were: Westralia, 170 and 161; S. Aus., 612.
* * * *
“Winkle” ; Colts will get no chance while
the Victorian teams are picked by antiquaries.
Against Westralia, with Wallace scrapped and Hart-
kopf too busy for big cricket, there were openings
for a googly and a fast bowler. Rayson is lucky
and consistent, and Ebeling and Gamble are youths
of promise, but all three were overlooked. Victoria
will be without a real express, and old Tarrant will
have to do all the slow work. With three or four
exceptions, the team is composed of old-timers who
would be thoroughly representative at a veterans’
picnic.
“H. Hardupp”: To-day, Melbourne cricket clubs,
mainly through the revenue they derive from the
football matches on the grounds for which they are
trustees, talk loosely in thousands, and the foot-
ball clubs arc even more affluent. By way of con-
trast, an old balance-sheet of the St. Kilda Football
Club of 1875 is worth resurrecting. The gross
revenue was £42 10s. 6d., and 01 members paid
£22 12s. 6d. of that in subscriptions. The chief
expenditure was £l3 145., for the annual dinner.
The only divagation from rigid economy appears to
have -occurred when some official in a fit of extrava-
gance spent 3s. fid. on cab-hire. This was over-
looked, however, in the general joy at the announce-
ment that there was a.credit balance of £6 Is. 10d.
held actually in cash.
* * * *
Adelaide club cricket adjourned for the
Westralian match with two rounds completed and
only two clubs unbeaten. Two men recently of
Sydney had something to do with this. Scott’s fast
bowling makes Sturt, already premiers, stronger
than ever; and a hard-hit innings by A. O. Gregory
enabled North Adelaide to just get home from Fast
Torrens by 14 runs.
* * * *
There is a movement on foot in Adelaide
to provide for the future of Jack Lyons, as that of
George Giffen was arranged not long ago. Not that
the great cricket veterans who brought South Aus.
into the limelight 40 years ago are in any actual
need of help, but it has been thought a fair thing
to put them beyond any need of worrying about
the future. Clem Hill, Scrymgour, Gordon Campbell
and Travers have the Lyons testimonial fund in hand,
and S.A. Cricket Association gives the plan its
active support.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: I am beginning to loathe all
cricket records, but a feat mentioned in recent English
papers, although not achieved in a first-class mate h,
must be a record for vigorous batting. Chapman,
the dashing left-hander who was out here with Gilli-
gan’s side, recently compiled 183, playing for a
brewery team against a police combination, in a
little over an hour. The total was only 201; the
balance of 18 was contributed by two batsmen and
Mr. Extras, eight players failing to make a run.
The Commonwealth hydroplane champion-
ship, over a 20-mile course, was the attraction at
Hamilton Reach, Brisbane River, on Saturday. There
were four entries: the Century Tire, holder (Wil-
liams), the Miss Queensland (George Whatmore, jun.),
the Willing Mind (J. Moxon) and the South Aus.
challenger, Tortoise 11. (Rymill Bros.). The Griffith
Cup goes back to Adelaide, after two years, as a.
result of the success of the last-named craft, which
won tw-o, out of the three heats. Unfortunately,
Century Tire struck a submerged object while lead-
ing in the first heat, and had to be beached in a
badly-damaged condition. When a few’ of these
marine streakers meet, it is long odds on an acci-
dent of some sort.

On October 24 the Tamar (Tas.) Rowing
Club celebrated its jubilee. The club was formed b.v
the amalgamation of two other clubs and a little
50ft. by 30ft. boatshed at the entrance to the
picturesque Cataract Gorge; what is now the care-
taker’s cottage was then inhabited by the ferry-
man who transported people across the river before
the Cataract Bridge was built. The first secretary
was Jack McCracken, who is still alive; the first
president v r as George Collins, who resigned two
years ago. The Tamar people now have about the
finest club-house and the best fleet of boats in
Australia. Many inter-State men learned how to
handle a loom from the shed, and Harrison Bourke,
now of Adelaide but then a member of the club,
won the Australian sculling championship four years
running.
* * * *
Those for whom the Yarra had mow
attractions on Saturday than the Saltwater did nol
lack thrills. In the first heat of the Junior Eights
Albert Park stole an
early advantage, but
with half a mile to go
the Banks crew came
with determination,
and, in a stroke-for-

A party of British bowlers has dropped
in on Australia, and is playing a series of matches
in Adelaide. (The Naldera had to cut out the in-
tended call on Westralia.) There are 30 men from
Scotland, 19 from England and four each from
Ireland and Wales. The intention is to tour the
Commonwealth extensively, and move homeward by
way of M.L. and the Panama Canal.
THE CONTRAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ramsay Macdonald complains that, the Prime Mini-
ster of (treat Britain is so badly paid that “his salary
and savings are inadequate to bear the burden when
the door' of 10 Downing-street closes upon him.
Public life for all men of modest possessions is a
never-ending struggle with debt.”
You think his job a moneyed one, a sort of milk-and-
honeyed one,
Who sits in lordly Downing-street where Gladstone
used to sit ?
A scroll of Fame to scrabble on unknown in Tyre or
Babylon
Is his, perfay, who fills the shoes of Palmerston and
Pitt!
The realm he earns renown upon is one no sun goes
down upon ;
He bends reluctant Parliaments and sovereigns to
his will.
But doesn't it make you think a. bit and shake your
head and blink a bit
To learn that many a red-faced Bung has more
inside the till?
Crowds never tire of hearing him and in the main
of cheering him,
The lightest word he ventures on is whirled the
earth around ;
He helps new laws to slap about and tear old Europe’s
map about,
But oh ! ’tis deadly hard for him to save a bloom-
ing pound.
The rolling years bring indigence, and love flies out
the windy, gents,
The proverb Says, when poverty upon tho door
shall knock.
To be a stiff Prime Minister that was ! —0 prospect
sinister !-
When one might be a pugilist, a trainer or a
jock.
The bookie strikes no attitudes, lie howls no party
platitudes,
Nor hankers to regenerate a world of struggling
men ;
He voices no solicitudes for common chaps’ vicissi-
tudes,
He doesn’t yearn to be his land’s outstanding
citizen.
But where the earthly treasure is be sure that there
his measure is.
Ramsay, you climbed the ladder high, the top-
most rung you tool;.
Would you—and here’s the gist of it —have made a
better list of it
(1 somehow think you might have done) if you had
been a book ?

“Stellsby”: “Chliota Peg" is adrift when
he mentions the quarter-deck of a merchant-
man (B. 15/10/’25). There isn't any; the
bridge is the sole fount of authority on that
type of vessel.
A recent gale which swept N. S. Wales
was responsible for the destruction of an old
English oak-tree which stood at the foot of
Ilassan’s Walls, a steep chain of sandstone
hills overlooking the Yale of Hartley and
part of the Blue Mountain Range. It was
one of the first oak-trees planted in Aus-
tralia, and has withstood the elements for
about 110 years. It was probably planted
as a memorial of Waterloo.
Richard Allen, the G.O.M. of Flinders-lane
since Stanley Bruce’s father died, now 83,
old-time king of the uommerical Travellers
and the monarch of the rag firm which
bears his name, still has a ready wit. Re-
cently an employee thought he ought to
have a rise, and when at the end of the
month the boss handed him his cheque
Shirts asked if there wasn’t to be any altera-
tion in his salary. The Old Man looked up
sharply. “Why,” he said, “were you ex-
pecting a reduction?”
“Only Australian”: Apropos the cable
from Noo Yark that an architect there
wants a panel room built entirely of Aus-
tralian timber. The reception-room of the
Union-Pacific Club, Francisco, is built en-
tirely of our maple, blackwood, oak,
mahogany and other decorative timbers. It
cost nearly 200,000 dollars, because it took
experts a long time to collect the timber in
Australia, and a still longer time to season
it; but it is doubtful whether another such
magnificent divan has ever been built.
“C. Coral” : Treacle, the hero of the shark
episode at Thursday Island some years ago,
when he succeeded in diving into a shark’s
open jaws and getting out again before the
surprised sea-lawyer could shut his mouth
on the bargain, will not regale his hearers
with thrills much longer. The doctors have
just had him in Thursday Island hospital
for a disease which he has contracted; and
he has now been sent back to his old home
on the east coast (he is a Night Islander)
to pass the remaining couple of months which
thev give him.
“Old North”: “Atherton” (B. 24/9/’25)
mentions the walnut growing in the N.
Queensland scrubs. This beautiful timber
is, as he says, quite equal to the European
walnut in all the qualities desired by cabinet-
makers, but has one serious drawback.
The wood is full of minute nodules of
resin, invisible to the eye, and they act
on saw-teeth as an abrasive, blunting their
points after a few minutes’ cutting has been
done. Experiments have been made with
specially-hardened saws, but so far without
success. Until this serious disability is
overcome the timber cannot be much used.
A man of parts is Baron Headley, of Eng-
land, inasmuch as he is two baronets, a peer,
an cx-editoi’, an engineer who has engined
in Ireland and Kashmir and intermediate
places, the author of a dozen or more works
of which the subjects range from boxing to
the erosion of foreshores, a Mohammedan,
a one-time pilgrim to Mecca, a septuagena-
rian, and the ex-husband of an Australian
widow with a gift for poetry. In addition
he was once in the funning, by reason of
his religious qualifications, for the kingship
of Albania; but if he had seized the prize
lie would probably have had to provide his
own throne and reigning tools, the little
State being broke. Age has not diminished
his vigor, for he remarked the other day:—
Englishmen are too prone to allow a small band of
bloodstained scalawags to hold up the country. Eng-
lishmen are content to lie down in the gutter while
a lot of unwashed, unholy people wipe their boots on
England’s whiskers. Only when an eye is kicked out
does John Bull wake up 'and do the right thing. We
should destroy the Communist as St. George did the
dragon.
A' man like that should have made his mark
in plain-spoken Albania.
A long way the most ancient Parliamen-
tarian in W.A. is the 71-year-old President
of the Eeg. Council, Edward Wittenoom,
whose grandfather arrived with the Pilgrim
Fathers of the Swan River settlement as
Colonial Chaplain. Wittenoom began his
Parliamentary career over 40 years ago as
a member of the old Council that ruled the
roost in pre-responsible government days.
For the last 30 years lie has had a seat in
the Chamber over which he now presides,
except for the four years he was Agent-
General and one or two brief breaks. He
was Forrest’s Minister of Mines in the roar-
ing days, and earned a deal of obloquy on
the goldfields—and the sobriquet of “Ten-
foot Ned” —by fathering the regulation
which limited the activities of alluvial miners
to that distance from the surface. The bitter
feeling culminated in the despiteful treat-
ment Forrest received in the so-called Kal-
goorlie riot of 1898, but his colleague, who
had been denounced even more vehemently,
was safe in the London office by that time,
and when he returned to his native land the
alluvial troubles were by way of being for-
gotten. Wittenoom was a pioneering pas-
toralist and a successful commercial man
before he became a political institution.
The Nationalists have secured a strong
political fighter for the contest against the
appai'ently invulnerable Frank Anstey in
Bourke (Vic.). E. J. Price has been wag-
ing war against the growth of the revolu-
tionary spirit for 17 years. In 1908 he was
a delegate from the Tramway Union to the
Sydney Labor Council, was one of the com-
mittee of the union during the tram strike,
and later was “victimised.” Price was also
a delegate at the fiivst Australian Socialist
Conference held in 190 S; but it was on that
conference he deqided that the socialism
many of the delegates were seeking was not
the sort he desired, so he set out to fight the
tendencies in the Labor movement to which
he objected. He fought it when, again work-
ing oix the trams, he was treasurer of the
Tramway Union in 1914, against Buckley
and the Reds; and he has since, at his own
expense, carried on his campaign in the chief
cities of all the States and Maoriland. He
was with Labor on the Conscription issue,
and was selected ahead of Anstey to tour
Australia as an anti-Conscription speaker.
The menace of Communism has now driven
him to join the Nationalists. In his fight
in Bourke he is introducing novel methods
by using moving pictures and a. cartoonist
to impress his points upon the minds of tha
public.


A Constructive Policy for Constructive Australians.
Reasons why YOU must Vote
NATIONALIST.
AL STRALIAN WOMANHOOD, because I will legis-
late to protect the mothers of our race through
MOTHERHOOD ENDOWMENT. I will provide for a
“SECRET BALLOT” of ALL members of unions before
striking. This will allow for the saner unionists, and
they are in a majority in every union—to vote before
the Gardens and Johnsons force the breadwinners to
strike.
All real Australians, because i stand for
“the greatest measure of defence compatible with
the manpower, of the nation. Our defence must be in
co-operation with the rest of the Empire, and particularly
with the British Navy.” The A.L.P. stands for abolition
of compulsory training. Mr. Charlton would leave you
helpless before the hordes of rapacious nations.
WORKERS OF AUSTRALIA, because my Govern-
ment is “determined to provide for our people a
standard of living which gives to our workers and
those dependent upon them a reasonable measure of
happiness and comfort. If great vital services are hold-
up production will be retarded, industry stagnant, and
unemployment rife.”
MOTORISTS, because my Government will ear-mark
£20,000,000 for main-road construction through-
out Australia. Motor duties totalling £2,000,000 yearly
will be spent upon this work. It will ensure the farmer
better roads and will open up a new and regular avenue
of employment.
MEMBERS OF THE A.1.F., because the Bruce
Government’s heart and soul is with the “ Digger”
and his family. My Government has liberalised benefits
to ex-soldiers and has reorganised the War Service Homes
Department to wipe out the errors of the past.
THE PRIMARY PRODUCER, because my Gov-
ernment was the first in Australia to appoint
a Minister for Markets. We have encouraged our
farmers to grow primary products and have taken
steps to ensure markets to our producers.
HOME LOVERS, because I will pass legislation
to utilise some of the savings of the people in
the Commonwealth Bank to enable the people to
build homes. And, I am prepared to raise
£20,000,000 in addition, to ensure that every city
and country dweller who desires to own his own
home, shall have the means to do so.
THE WOOL GROWER, because my Government is
making available £3,000,000 for the provision of
wire netting to enable further lands to be put under sheep.'
THERE IS A READY MARKET FOR OUR WOOL.
THE MANUFACTURER, because the Bruce Govern-
ment, by its tariff revision in the last session, has
saved to Australia many local industries that were
languishing. My Government will continue its policy
of encouraging secondary industries throughout Australia.
TRADES UNIONISTS, because I believe that our
industries should be governed by a uniform working
week for Australia. My concrete proposal is that the
judges of the Federal and State Industrial Courts should
be asked to report upon this; and that the State Premiers
should be invited to legislate accordingly. This is the
scientific solution of a huge problem which will appeal
to both employer and employee.
THOSE WITH NATION-WIDE VISION, because
we have pushed on with the Murray Waters
Scheme; have agreed to the construction of the
Kyogle-Brisbane standard-gauge railway, and have
agreed to ask Parliament to build the overland
railway to Alice Springs.
“Keep A ustraUa
White-Rot Red”
“We point with justifiable
pride to our record, and ask
you to again entrust us with
the reins of Government. You
know what we have done; you
know exactly where we stand.”
S. M. BRUCE, Prime Minister.

MR. BRUCE.
Upon YOUR Vote depends
the destiny of Australia for
the next Three Years.
Do YOU know that
Government has:—
T} EDUCED TAXATION by 12 p.c. In other words,
IV for every pound sterling you formerly piaid you
now save 2/6.
WHILE STATE LABOR Governments have in-
ci eased taxation and thus reduced cmfploymeiit,
the Bruce Government has freed industry from portion’
of its financial burden, allowing more workers to be
absorbed in industry.
C OXTERED CIVIL AVIATION, so tlat to-day
* there is a network of aerodromes throughout the
Commonwealth at strategic points of both trade and
war-time value.
OBTAINED an expert’s report upon the control
and development of our ports and harbors.
The States will he asked to co-operate in formulat-
ing- a national policy.
NOT FORGOTTEN THE PIONEERS. Old-age
pensioners received TV O increases during the life
of the Bruce Government, thus establishing a record by
any Federal Government.
| NQUIRED into UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,
■l and, acting- upon the report of its Royal
Commission, will legislate accordingly to deal with
those innocent social victims who suffer through
causes they cannot control,
DECIDED to vote £Ji5O,OOO as a special grunt to
West Australia, and will consider the whole
financial position of this State during the next Parlia-
ment.
SAVED the “movie” and theatre patron £300,000
by removing- the entertainment tax on admis-
sions up to 2/(?. Unfortunately the State Labor
Government in West Australia is re-imposing this
tax upon the people.
J jAS REDUCED TAXATION as follows:
Income tax
Post Office charges. .
Indirect taxation . .
Amusement tax . .
Land tax on leasehold
£3,400,000
1,000,000
830,000
360,000
100,000
Total relief
£5,690,000
WAR debt reduced by £15,000,000. The Bruce
Government is the only Government in Australia
to establish the principle that “new loan expenditure
shall be made only in respect of services which will
stimulate the production of the country and PERMA-
NENTLY EXTEND THE AVENUES OF EMPLOY-
MENT.
SYMPATHETICALLY administered the War Pensions
and War Service Homes Department, and has dealt
with the problems of our returned men in the true spirit
of Australia.
PROVIDED markets for our dried fruit, canned
fruits and meat industries.
ASSISTED our secondary industries to expand upon
healthy, vigorous lines, thus enabling manufac-
turers to establish self-contained factories and to absorb
many Australians in continuous employment.
100 CENT. AUSTRALIANS, because the Bruce Government stands for sanity in politics; for Big Australianism, for law and
order, and for the maintenance of those vital services of transport upon which the prosperity of every working-employer,
producer and working-employee depends.
So as Big Australians—

In Gwitha Sowerby’s “Rutherford and
Son,” produced by G. Beresford Fowler at
the Queen’s Hall (Melb.), a gripping story
is made out of the English North Country
character. John Rutherford, masterful and
“THE GREAT
LOVER,” AT
SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Moscovttch Pwurel drops a tear at the shrine
of his numerous loves.
austere, a champion athlete in his younger
days, beats the souls of all those around him
and his own into the service of the Moloch
he has built, the glass-making industry of
Rutherford and Son. His son John (Beres-
ford Fowler) leaves home, but comes back
hating it with his wife Mary (Ilettie Fener-
man), a working girl, who has a Rutherford
grandson. John merely wants to get away
again. The old man’s other son, Richard
(Claude Thomas), who has also disappointed
liis father by becoming a parson, eagerly
accepts the opportunity of moving to another
parish. And a daughter, Janet (Ruth Cona-
bere), despoiled of other chances of happi-
ness, seeks and finds an intrigue with her
father’s most trusted workman, Martin
(Oscar Behrend). Thus and thus does his
house of cards fall about the ears of the
hard old man. Taking it all round, a finely-
constructed play, and well delivered, in spite
of some amateurish touches and a forgetful-
ness of their lines by a few of the players.
Beyond those already mentioned, Bertha
Collin, as Mrs. Henderson, and Betty Rae,
as Ann, Rutherford’s sister, offered very
good character studies. A repetition of
‘'Candida,” with a scene from “Oliver Twist”
as a curtain-raiser, occurred on Saturday,
and “Ghosts” was to be repeated last night
(4th). But Rutherford is Beresford Fow-
ler's best effort to date.
It might be unfair to compare the work
of Frank Neil in “The Private Secretary,”
which opened at Melbourne New Palace on
Saturday, with the inimitable drollery of
Frank Thornton as the Reverend Robert
Spalding; but to be a great success the
comedy demands some such outstanding com-
edian, and because it hasn’t got him the
company which Neil commands failed to
score as well as it did in “Charley’s Aunt”;
yet that is not to say that the audience
failed to give a plentiful tribute of laughter.
Neil represented the bleating parson on the
lines of broad comedy—broader in places
than they ought to have been. The part of the
vulgar tailor Gibson sat fairly comfortably
upon Jefferson Taite, although his fooling
was sometimes as playful as a gambolling
elephant; and Fitzherbert made a boisterous,
humorous and fairly convincing Cattermole.
Miss Betterton Glover, as tlie landlady whose
attempts to paint the nephew Douglas Catter-
mole (Maurice Tuoliy) as a virtuous young
man drive him to anger, and help to give
a basis for the subsequent hilarious mis-
understandings, and Vera Remee, as the
spiritualistic Miss Marsland, did well. Alma
Stewart deserves a special bouquet for fitting
at short notice into the part of Edith Mars-
land, which Jessie Page had been billed to
play; and that old stage favorite, Tom Can-
nam, who has been away from the boards
for years, was in the cast in the small part
of Ivnox, the writ-server.
This week “No, No, Nanette,” after a run
that lias made glad the heart of the manage-
ment, will vanish from the New Princess
(Melb.), where “Archie” is to arrive on
Saturday. And while “Archie” is cheering
the public, some of the brightest members of
the co. will be trying their steps for the
panto.
Having by that time bloomed for 48 weeks
and a day, “Wildflower” will be transplanted
after Saturday week (Nov. 14) to Sydney,
where it budded, and there it will run out
the first year of its glad existence.
In a shuffle of shows in Melbourne the
“'Street Singer,” which has been giving the
Theatre Royal another period of popularity,
will go on to his Majesty’s. “The Farmer’s
Wife” will bring to the Royal the atmosphere
of the cowslip—or it may be the cowbail —
on November 21.
It is still “Fair and Warmer” at Mel-
bourne King's, and likely to be for some time
yet.
In “Give and Take” at Melbourne
Athemcum Harry Green has hardly varied a
gesture; but Roy Rene has improved steadily
as he has got used to playing a set part.
And it is no light part—7o “sides.”
Nellie Kolle, popular as ever, returned to
Melbourne Bijou last Saturday, and
helped considerably to brighten a programme
which, having lost “The Optimists,” has re-
verted to vaudeville. Nick Morton is an
interesting pattcr-and-song merchant, Victor
Burke carols effectively in a likeable baritone,
and, generally, the programme is good.
Arthur Jordan, still suffering from a cold,
was a regrettable absentee from the last
Uni. Conservatorium concert at the Mel-
bourne Assembly Hall; Edward Goll filled
the gap with, amongst other items, a delight-
fully brisk rendering of Chopin’s “Scherzo
in C Sharp Minor.” But the principal fare
was the courses
provided by the
string quartette —
Bernard Heinze,
Stanley Tomkins,
William Lamble
and Louis Hatten-
bacli —whose mana
is increased with
every appearance,
although there is
still sometimes a
lack of perfect pro-
portion of tone.
The instrumental-
ists developed some
really glowing work
in Ilaydn’s “D
Major Quartette.”

Lully’s “Bois Epais,” though good gener-
ally, being marred by a few strained notes.
Arthur Ivempton, with a finely-clear enunci-
ation but some tonal uncertainty, and Roy
Warren (splendid in Schumann’s “Month of
May”) were the suppliers of the mascu-
line tones. Songs by British composers made
up the second half of the programme; for
which the British Music Society can lay
some flattering unction to its Soul-.

Tlie doings of the enterprising gentieman-
burglar Ruffles occupy a good part of the
screen-space Ut Hoyt's He Luxe (Melb.) this
week, House Beters representing the man
with a partiality for other people’s dia-
monds ; Jane Novak in “The Lullaby” sup-
plies the other star feature. “Jewelled
Nights” has moved on to the New Gaiety.
At the Majestic the audience is invited to
“Hold Your Breath,” and the picture justi-
fies its name. Conway Tearle and Madge
Kennedy make “Bad Company” for the sup-
porting screen, and two singers of class,
Frank Foster and Robert Needham (the last
for some time with Williamson cos. years
ago), provide melody for the interval.
He is still in Melbourne; but after Monday
night Wirths’ elephant will pack his trunk
and silently steal away.
Art’s -Cup-time celebrations :
Arthur Streeton is greeting Cup visitors to Mel-
bourne with an impressive exhibition at the Fine
Art Gallery, Exhibition-street, and, to meet all tastes,
he has included two water-colors, four silk fans
and four lithographs. But the real Streeton is in
the 26 oils, even if they do include a “Crayfish”
and some “Vegetables” which, apart from the work-
manship, are not above the things Oysteropoulos likes
to hang in his emporium. Other stills, “Nastur-
tiums” (No. 22) and “Campanulas” (No, if),
are dainty and delightful. The landscapes, views
around Olinda and elsewhere, are masterly and arrest-
ing, though showing a tendency to paintiness in
places—there is a suggestion that Nature could not
have given these views without the aid of Streeton.
The sweeping fall of the “Mountain Side” (No. 2)
gives that thrill that some people feel when they
stand beside a steep declivity; “The Valley from
Olinda Top” (No. 5), two pictures of “The Valley
from Kennon's” (Nos. 11 and 19) and “Macedon
Seventy Miles Away” (No. 26) are amongst the
others which arrest the eye and stir the senses.
His choice of subject is often not good, but
A. E. Newberry’s exhibition at the Athenaeum Hall
calls attention to the rapidly improving work of a
patient and conscientious artist, who deserves an
encouragement which he invites by his modest
prices. The very agreeable show includes some
delightfully fresh sea-shore pictures, some misty views
delicately done, an ambitious “Spring Pasturage”
(No. 80) which would have been better for better
foliage, and a portrait which shows careful draughts-
manship but lacks life.
At the new Sedon Galleries, in Elizabeth-street,
are six very fine bronzes by the late Web Gilbert,
which are being sold by order of the Commonwealth
Government. Gilbert’s virility is shown in each of
these pieces, which represent the Digger in action.
One, “Over the Top,” shows the weight of the
body flung forward from the foot on the trench-top,
the other foot planted on the parapet, and the rifle
flung out in outstretched arm to recover balance—-
a lively expression of action. A rival is “The
Bomber” —the action for the swing of the bomb,
the bomb-hand flung back for the throw and the
left hand forward for balance, is splendid.
See Maurice Moscovitch at Sydney Cri.
Emotions such as few can vivify
Deftly uncover,
And give this section of the world good-bye
In “The Great Lover.”
The Walter Bentley testimonial did not
bring in the result the Sydney committee ex-
pected. The roll-up was sparse, though the
programme was unusually good. Arthur
Greenaway and Jean Robertson dressed up
Hamlet and Ophelia in golfing kit and one
of the latest next-to-nothing evening frocks,
and demonstrated to the surprise of many
that the bard was clotlies-proof—the lines
would sound just as well if surrounded by a
lava-lava and a top-hat. Another notable
performance on a .star bill was the absurd
“Wedding Ring” from the “Music Box,” with
Dot Brunton, Compton Coutts and Harry
Burgess as laugh-raisers.
“The Music-box Revue” is in its posi-
tively final week at Sydney Opera House.

You may leave it to glib politicians
On the platform to render it plain

“The Bad Man” is entering on the last
lap of his picturesque career of outlawry at
Sydney Royal.

Laurence Godfrey Smith and Ethel Lewis,
just returned from a successful concert tour
of the Apple Isle, joined forces again at the
Sydney Con. last week. With them was
violinist Gerald Walenn, and the bright gem
of the evening was the Brahms “Sonata in
A,” itl which tile violin and the piano got
very those to the perfect rendering.
Ethel Lewis is one of those singers with
not much voice who can still manage to make
a recital grip the ear and the fancy. Her
specialty is old Irish songs, though she
sometimes culls from the Saxon and the
Scot. She comes to Sydney from Ireland
by way of India, where her husband is in
the army. She will give another recital
to-niglit (Thursday) at the Adyar Hall, with
Mr. Smith at the keyboard.
“GIVE AND TAKE,” AT MELBOURNEI.
ATHENMUM.
John Bauer (Harry Green) listens while
Albert, the foreman ( Roy Rene), per-
suades him to hand over his canning
factory and 50 p.c. of the profits to the
employees.
"In Old Japan,” at Fullers’ Sydney, house,
is a whimsical and tuneful conceit, with the
additional attraction of some alleged Geisha
Girls. Harry Taft talks much more brightly
than the average politician, and Barbarina’s
tight-rope performance is rendered more
snappy by the collaboration of a toy pom.
Oardini juggles with adroitness and other
things, and the orchestra’s musical selections
are above the average.

Herschel Henlere still puts in his clever
work at Sydney Tivoli, and the Three Swifts
handle clubs with all the facility shown by
thimbleriggers with peas. Walter Nilsson
does some weird things with impossible-look-
ing unicycles, and Jennie Benson’s character
studies seem to linger pleasingly on patrons’
palates. A modicum of humor is also pro-
vided by The Big Four, and a cinema car-
toon comedy on Mutt and Jeff lines is being
received with approval.
:{: ifc
Iloyt’s Sydney home is still thrilled. by
Gloria Swanson in "Madame Sans Gene” —
the most attractive picture of the moment.
“Reveille,” at the Lyric, is English for
a change, even to the costers and the
whelk-stalls and a disillusioned soldier
and a remarkably piquant flapper. The
Lyceum, Haymarket and Piccadilly trans-
port, their patrons to the Manxland
of Hall Caine with “Name the Man,”
adapted from “The Master of Man."
Here one may sup full of Caine horrors and
heartbreaks, the characters including a
crone who throws red pepper in a merciless
stepfather’s eyes, and a Deemster who has
to sentence a girl be himself has betrayed.
It’s all very Cainish, and leaves a dark-
brown taste in the mouth.
“Secrets,” at Adelaide Royal, is one. of the
most effective plays seen recently, having the
tear not far behind the smile, with five
minutes of real thrill and three sets of cos-
tumes of varying periods. Nearly all the
opportunities go to Muriel Starr, and slic
has rarely, if ever, done better work. A large
cast, disdaining to “double,” gives varying
support. At the York Mary Bickford tries
hard to pretend that she is still a small raga-
muffin in “Annie Rooney,” and Wong Toy
Sun in person does some effective conjuring.
At Wondergrapli Nazimova is giving heart-
throbs. The plucky grand-opera season at
the Prince of Wales continues, with a change
each night. Singing and staging are good,
acting not quite so good in some cases. But
one does wish that for a popular season like
this the pieces might be given in English.

Poverty
Point
“Bris”: Lottie Sargent, who has died m
a Brisbane private hospital after a long ill-
ness, spent most of her life on the stage,
having made her first appearance as a child
of six. Brisbane people remember her chiefly
for her work with the Reynolds-De Tisne
co. during its long season at the Theatre
Royal, but in former years she was a dainty
little songandance lady in Williamson com-
panies. Lottie’s husband, baritone Frank
Greene, is in America.
“Flaming Youth”: Mrs. Pitt Rivers
waited until the parental Forsters had quitted
Government House before taking the pro-
fessional stage job which she might have
had long ago. The lady is to figure in a
new play by Somerset Maugham at Christ-
mastime, and will join the Boucicault co. to
play Barrie pieces early next year. She has
made some satisfactory amateur appearances,
notably in Pshaw’s “Pygmalion.”
“Caesar's Ghost” The Fuller-Ward firm
is the only one which is talking panto, this
year. Its rivals departed from the old J. C.
Williamson tradition last Christmas, and
there is no sign of their returning to it.
Frank Noil is to produce the Fuller-Ward
affair, which will occupy the Melbourne Prin-
cess, while “The Music Box” revue inhabits
the New Palace. That means the closing-
down of Neil’s own show for a time; but
“Charley’s Aunt” has been so successful that
he is arranging to secure the Palace again
for a series of such old laugli-stirrers as
“When Knights Were Bold,” “Arc You a
Mason?” “Why Smith Left Home,” “The
Wrong Mr. Wright” and “What Happened
to Jones.”
“J.T.D.”: “Lysander’s” par. about Ller-
scliel Henlere and his “League of Nations
Anthem” (B. 15/10/’25) carried me back
to the days when I)e Wet was dodging
Settle’s Imperial Circus and other slow-
moving outfits in S’Africa. An Australian
comedian was putting in a season at Mel-
bourne Tivoli, then known as the Opera
House. One night, after several recalls, he
came on and said: “Ladies and gentlemen,
I have important news to announce on be-
half of the management. De Wet has been
captured.” The house went wild. Calling
for order, the comedian suggested sing-
ing “God Save,” and all stood up
and let it go, the orchestra playing the
accompaniment standing. They were start-
ing to cheer again when an infant who had
assisted the comedian in his turn rushed on
shouting, “It’s only a rumor!” The audi-
ence took it well, but Harry Rickards didn’t.
That funny man never appeared on the
circuit again.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Mione Stewart,
who has become Mrs. James Denyer, was
cradled in the profession. A niece of Aus-
tralia’s well-loved Sweet Nell, she is a
daughter of Dick Stewart, himself au actor
before he took to the managerial side of the
business, by his marriage with Constance
Deorwyn. Constance’s sister Alice married
Charles Holloway, and became the mother
of Beatrice Holloway. The Deorwyns are
daughters of John Hayward, an old-time
actor, who retired from the stage and was
for a while with the Fitzroy (Vic.) Muni-
cipal Council. Returning to the boards, he
took the name Deorwyn and coached his
clever daughters, who had had a sort of
preliminary training at “Penny Readings.”
I was present at the old Theatre Royal,
Melbourne, shortly before G. V. Brooke
sailed for England, w T hen a number of ama-
teurs tendered that great actor a benefit.
The play was Colman’s “Poor Gentleman” ;
John Hayward (Deorwyn) was Sir Robert
Bramble ; Hugh John Chambers, sometime a
Sydney solicitor, was Lieutenant Worthing-
ton ; James Smith, the journalist, was Cor-
poral Foss: and other characters were filled
by prominent men. At the conclusion the
co. assembled on the stage, with G. V. Brooke
in the centre, and James Smith presented the
great actor with a cheque for £2OO, the
amount of the takings.
“E.T.”: I shall miss Charles Kenning-
bam’s informative and always amusingly-told
reminiscences of the old Savoy days, with
THE JAZZ OF DEATH.
“Yer don't mean ter tell me the bloke choked a woman to death
in a crowded cafe an' no one interfered ?"
“Yes, they all thought it wan some new dance.”
their interesting sidelights on the great Gil-
bert and Sullivan partnership. It has not
been mentioned since his death that Ivenning-
ham was a graceful ballad composer. I
think I am right in saying that Gilbert sup-
plied the lyric for one of his songs.
“Hamfat” : Madame Lauzanne is likely to
get something more than the £2OOO which
came to her as a result of her action for
breach of promise against a Sydney brewer.
The Gaumont people, having inspected
moving-pictures showing the lady with her
lawyer, have decided that she has a “picture
face,” and offered her an engagement as a
screen actress. What the engagement is
worth is not stated, but the inducement would
need to be substantial to attract any charmer
from a country where £2OOO settlements have
become fashionable.
“E.T.”: Reginald Purdell, the light com-
edian of various J. C. WilliamscSn musical
shows a season or two ago, lias blossomed
as a dramatic author in London. At the
Everyman Theatre, out Hampstead Heath
way, Reginald’s comedy “I’ll Tell the
World” was recently produced, with Jean
Forbcs-Robertson (here with mother) and
Aubrey Mather (also here under the same
mgis) in principal parts. Apparently it was
not quite a winner, but some of the reviews
were distinctly encouraging.
“J.P.”: “O.B.B.” (B. 8/10/’25) says that,
the first production of “Rip Van Winkle ’
in Sydney was at the Gaiety Theatre in
1885. I suppose he is referring to Plan-
quette’s comic opera of that name; Bouci-
cault’s drama arrived much earlier. W. B.
Gill produced the dramatic version in the
’seventies, when he was lessee of the old
Queen's Theatre, in York-street. I well
recollect the miniature Catskill Mountains
up which Rip Van Gill climbed with his keg
of beer, in company with the spirits of Hen-
drik Hudson and his crew.
“Mana” : An old ship with a history lies
high and dry on the beach at Pine Island,
in Waitamata (M.L.) Harbor. This is the
Retriever, the original craft of “Gappy
Ricks” fame. Last mouth a company play-
ing the dramatised version of the Peter B.
Ivyne story in Auckland, hearing of tin- old
hooker, went up the river and inspected her.
Quite a number of Aucklanders, after seeing
the play, did likewise.
“C. Ockney”: I did not suggest that be-
cause Wilson Barrett had created the part
of “The Silver King,” and played it for the
whole of the original long run in London,
he was “naturally the best exponent" (B.
22/10/ 25). I wonderingly asked how the
English actor, having such a record,
could have been the “failure” that “Mid-
Channel” boldly asserted he was. “Mid-C.,”
now very much at sea, says he was writing
of those who played the character in Aus-
tralia—as if that mattered. I am glad to
note, however, that he qualifies his dis-
paraging remark, and now speaks of “com-
parative failure.” These amateur critics,
with their rash, ill-digested statements, make
an old playgoer very tired,
“Harold Hardupp”: Aquariums seem to
have gone out of
fashion as pleasure
resorts; the one at
Exhibition Build'
i n g, Melbourne,
showed a loss of
£854 during last
year, and the trus-
tees say that, un-
less otherwise in-
structed by Parlia-
ment;, they will
close down. Time
was when Sydney
had three of the
fishy showpieces
going at once, and
th e y ha d their
period of pros-
perity with the
assistance of side-
shows in the
grounds attached.
Bu t when tli e
liquor licenses were
cut ; off it was
found that even
ladies in tights
failed, to popularise
the marine exhibits,
and the establish-
ments closed up one
after the other.
Showman Bill An-
derson tried to
turn the Bondi
Aquarium Grounds
into a sort of
Coney Island,
which lie named
Wonderland City,
but the venture was
not a success;
what is left of the
once extensive
Coogee Aquarium
is a swimming-
bath : and the
aquarium on the Corso, Manly, has completely
disappeared.
“Loco” : The Wirths’ circus train had just
left our depot, and somebody remarked on
the invaluable assistance the elephants had
given. The S.M. became reminiscent. “Once
we had a rake of trucks ready to load. They
wanted moving a few yards, but we had no
engine handy. The big elephant stepped up,
seemingly knowing what was required. ‘O-o-
o-op !’ went the keeper, and the great head
was applied to the trucks and shoved them
the required distance. There were over 200
tons dead weight in those trucks, and three
brakes were hard down!” “It’s, a rough
life for the attendants,” hazarded someone.
“Yes, but you’ll find ’em very human,” said
a third. “Once when this circus was at
Ouyen the heat was 118 deg. in the shade.
Phil Worth, the boss, had secured a bagful of
cool water for the children of the company.
But it disappeared, and was finally located
amongst the tent hands. They’had emptied
out the water and filled the bag with beer.
Phil was very nearly in tears over it. ‘Fancy
having men who would steal the children’s
water-bag in this weather!’ he said. And
after making them empty out the beer and
clean the bag, he sacked them on the spot.
A circus tent was no place for them!”
“Flaming Youth”: These are harassing
times for circus bosses. “Billed like a circus”
is a phrase with a limited meaning nowadays,
for the distribution of handbills is prohibited
in many places; also, the art of B. Stick-
ers is restricted to set hoardings, which are
much more expensive than they used to be.
The arrival of the circus in full panoply, with
band playing, is another method of advertis-
ing on which local authorities frown; and,
anyway, the band wants extra payment for
every extra blast on its collective horn—
even down to playing outside the show. With
all these restrictions, and others, wages and
salaries, especially in the case of star turns,
have soared enormously. It costs a tidy
sum to give a show on any one night, and
the loss of that night means a heavy bite out
of the bank account. So the circus has to
crowd its profits into as few nights as pos-
sible and keep moving on to where fresh
profits may be made. Worst of .all, young
Bill is not so keen on clowns and acrobats
and performing animals as old Bill used to
be. It is the latter who is the circus's best
patron, and though young Bill sometimes
accompanies him to please “the old pot."
he is really more interested in radio and the
pitchers.
“Hamfat”: There has been a reunion in
Australia of the Browne family, Herbert
Browne, the rather stiff young man with the
tuneful voice who is Guido in “Wildflower,"
having met in Melbourne his two sisters, who
were on the stage when he was learning, to
be an engineer. One of the sisters is that
Blanche Browne who was a popular singing
member of J. C. Williamson companies before
she married and settled dowm in Tasmania.
The other is now Mrs. Saker. and she lias
just arrived from England. Herbert himself
came here after the war with the idea of
going on the land in Maoriland, but the
lure of the stage attracted him, and his voice
did the rest.
“Tuna”: For a conscientious artist Bates
Post is singularly sloppy in the local color
he introduces into ‘‘The Bad Man.” When
he threatens to take the girl to “Mexicana"
with him it is equivalent to asking her to
elope to “French”: and the Mexican rugs
handed round so lavishly might go down as
the genuine article in N'York, but would
hot pass muster in Aguas Calientes. In
Mexico we light our own cigarette first and
hand it to our vis-a-vis, who lights his from
it: and although we may talk pidgin Eng-
lish to a gringo, we don't generally use it
to our compatriots. Finally (though there's
a lot more), any ranch-owner who cultivated
cactus as an ornamental shrub beside his
door would get the same treatment from his
neighbors as a farmer in Bananaland who
potted prickly-pear.
“R.D.”: “C.G.’s” suggestion that Percy
Grainger has “caught our sunshine and ran
it into melody” <B. 22/IP/'25) is a little
far-fetched. Grainger is a great pianist and
an interesting composer, but as far as pure
inspiration is . concerned Australia doesn t
seem to have affected him in the slightest.
He has been influenced far more by Grieg
and the young English writers who have
been discovering old folk-songs. Is it his
collection of “Colonial Songs” that are sup-
posed to have sunlight in them? The title
is just as suggestive of the light on Canadian
snow—and the music, too ! Indeed, Grainger
seems to have a special affinity with the
folk-genius of the frozen North.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Ibsen lives only as %
cult; remembered as shockers in a genera-
tion when all women covered their ankles,
his plays seem prim in these times. And
there are other considerations which make
them out of date. One of them was suggested
by a bobbed-hair young lady at the Queen's
Hall performance of “Medda Gabler” when
the Tesman household was concerned about
the vague report that Eilert Lovborg had
been taken to hospital. “Why don’t they
ring up the hospital and find out?” she de-
manded of her escort, pausing in her con-
sumption of his chocolates. The bobbed-hair
generation can’t understand plays without
telephones on the table and motor-cars at
the door.
“T. 0.1.”: I was present in the ’sixties at
an amateur performance by members of the
Vic. Leg. Assembly in aid of the Melbourne
Uni.’s Sliakspeare Scholarship Fund. The
play was “The Merchant of Venice,” and
Mark Last King, an old actor who before
retirement played as Moreton King, was
Shyloek. Peter Lalor, who lost an arm at
Eureka, was the Duke; A r incent Pyke was
the Merchant; George Coppin,, then an
M.L.C., was Launcelot Gobbo, and Tom Car-
penter, a Cornish miner, was Old Gobbo.
The others were not worse than amateurs
usually are. John Dennistoun Wood, the Tas-
manian, recited a prologue written by G. V •
Ilusden, Clerk of the Parliament; and Vin-
cent Pyke, afterwards a Minister in Maori-
loud. delivered a witty epilogue written by
himself.

Dear Sir,
The F.I-.A .T« Agricultural Tractor has just mads
a new World's record for continuous ploughing of 720 hours,
constituting 30 days and 30 nights down oouth at C-rong Grong on the
property of Geo.Cowell Esq. "Agrlcastrol" Tractor oil was used
exclusively and the re was net at any time the slightest sign of dilution
of the Crankcase oil by Kerosene. The record put up bf this Tractor
was not in any way assisted by us, and it was only after a week's
continuous running that at our request Mr. Cowell had the further
performance of the Tractor checked and verified by four responsible
parties. The run was only terminated by the fury of the Dust Storms
which made it impossible to keep the Tractor following & straight
line owing to the blinding sand.
We always insist on our Tractor Owners using
"Agrlcastrol" Tractor oil, and therefore on this occasion did not
give any special instructions regarding lubrication. The quantity
of "Agrlcastrol" Tractor oil used was approximately f of a gallon
for each 30 hours running.
The P.I.A.T. TRaCTOR used was absolutely
standard In every way and not one of the latest models.

The fame of a great name lives
in the Westinghou'se Battery.”
IT COSTS LESS TO
BUILD THEM BETTER
Warped, split, sodden wooden
cases—jars that rattle, crack and
leak—these were inevitable in a
storage battery before Westinghouse developed the
moulded one-piece composition case.
This case, used exclusively in Westinghouse Batteries,
adds materially to their worth, and most battery buyers
would have been glad to pay extra for its convenience
and economy.
But the amazing fact is that this special Westinghouse
construction can actually be produced by the great West-
inghouse organisation to sell at less than the cost of the
old-fashioned inefficient wooden case and individual jars.
It will pay you to investigate this NEW and BETTER
battery.

Realise the
Comfort of having
Plenty of Light
and Power.
DEPENDABLE LIGHT.
FOR the user of an electric-lighting plant in isolated places, whether private house
or institution, RELIABILITY is the prime essential. Past and present perform-
ances not only throughout Australasia, but in all parts of the world, have proved
that no lighting plant is able to equal the reputation of
Hie

British bui^l
e
l
LOW SPEED is one of the main secrets of ‘’tfisferJJ'fs) success.
The full output is delivered at a low speed of between 400 and 600 R.P.M., therefore
minimising friction and wear, expensive lubrication systems and elaborate ignition and
cooling devices. Most other engines in Lighting Plants have to run at the terrific speed of
1800 to 2000 R.P.M. to attain their maximum output. It only needs comparison to convince
the difference in the expense for running such plants as against the small expense of running
the “Lister-Lite.” Another advantage in installing a “Lister-Lite” plant is the convenience
and comfort the Electric Power it generates can give to you.
The same dependability is built into every part of the “Lister-Lite” Plant. It is BRITISH
BUILT throughout. There is a type to suit every country Home, Institution, Church or
Business Premises.
The Agents for “Lister-Lite” have an aggregate of 335 years’ service in Australia behind
them. This experience in Lighting and Power is given for the asking. Send to them for

No diamond is examined more carefully for possible

The most powerful magnifying glass could never reveal

DRAWING IS PROFITABLE
The Weston method of
teaching drawing by post
is the most successful, be-
cause Mr. Weston teaches
his students to DRAW, not
to copy.
Many Weston pupils earn
money before they complete
the course, whilst several
successful Australian artists
owe their first training to
the Weston School.

'JPv MOWER
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.c., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2f-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
Printed matter supplied with pleasure on application.

short.,. .J.R.L.: That’s good rhyming of its kind,
anyhow, -“due t’ yer” and “future”.. J\.Gembrook:
Can t undertake to return MS. of unaccepted pars.
. ...Emel; “Orchard” the best of the bunch. It is
nicely done, but so slight. .. . P.N.M.: You started off
without knowing well what you were going to say,
and the result is a waste of words V.C.J.: Your
yarn has the fashionable thinness. The Bulletin'
likes them a little plumper E.M.E.: Not the
goods for this barrow 1.M.D.: Thin little yarn
that doesn’t altogether make us believe it’s true. . ..
k.F. (Broken Hill): All in the right direction, but
they don’t quite arrive. Don’t manufacture words
to lit your lines K.B. (Parkville) : Not bad as
far as it goes, but not much there N.E.R.: “Noon”
misses, but not by more than 30sec Vera AV.:
The verse doesn’t say enough and falls back on
commonplaces E.AV.AV.: Repeats the old things
that have been better said a thousand times.. . .
P.P.P.: The first stanza spoils it; the rest might
pass... . J.H.A.; Fails rather badly... .Oliver B.:
It has a thoroughly agricultural flavor:—
Well, well 1 I don’t know, it’s wonderful;
Every years the mallee’s disappearing;
let more and more we’re hopeful;
At the wheel the right men are steering.
Yes! steering and forging away.
No need for praise, it’s plainly seen;
Ah. but there’s some old faces gone, I say—-
Those faces of grit, hard, and lean.
Ah yes, yes! day by day some pass away,
As year by 3' ear the Show returns ;
Younger ones come, get the sway,
To face, conquer and learn.
Everything is absolutely splendid;
It’s hard to pick anything not worth a prize.
Yet some say it couldn’t be did •
To grow the stuff to make such a rise.
W.A.G.; A long way to go 8.L.L.: Far too
rugged and rather weak in thought H.M.C.: The
verse doesn’t move us; and the descriptive article
is not in our line.... Lyn C.: Too weak and keeps
the beaten track of commonplace. .. .Pepito: Crude
and shows only a thin knowledge of the subject....
Plodder; “Summer” ‘is rather weak N'.D.R.; The
people are too futile and unreal; and the mirth is
heavy and lumpish F.G.H.: Not much in it;
and some of the lines are badly out of step....
C.R.S.: Not nearly enough life and c010r... .C.R.M.:
The fact that a diamond will outlast a man doesn’t
strike us as a matter of “surprise” and “awe.”
Even a common brick can do that Bellerive:
The Organ Grinder” shows a deep sympathy with
the picturesque things of life:—
Peals of merry laughter
From children waft’eth out
At the organ grinder’s monkcv
Which prance and leap about •
hrom my open window
I drop a penny down
To tlie old Italian—
From the city of renown.
My little Annie Rooney
And other tunes he’ll play
While he’s monkey caper’s—
In an impish way.
In cold and misty weather
He plays he’s squeaky organ
And sultry heat and dust,
To earn an honest crust.
... . Harry M.; “Pedestals” is nasty without being
interesting Game; Not badly done, but there isn’t
much in the idea... .Marie S.: Crude in form and
matter. There is a lot of work ahead before vou
can “put thoughts on paper” as you desire
H.M.W. : The yarn doesn’t stir us C.J.G.R.: Far
too slight J.H. (Gympie) : “Fickle” misses
Dubbadee; According to the last census, Victoria
was the most Australian of the mainland States and
Westralia the least—B7oB Australian-born per 10,000
in one case, and 7503 per 10,000 in the other.
AVestralia had 2012 per 10.000 of British-born (born,
that is, in the British Isles), South Australia 937,
the lowest figure in the mainland group Black B.:
Ihe intention is good, but the verse is crude, and
affords you no medium for expression.... A.AV.; The
lady didn’t know where the house was, and took
some time to find it. Only that, and nothing more.
AV.E.B.; No distinction about it M.1.L.: The
verse has little quality, and the ideas are far from
fresh; but you’ll probably do better.....Thomaß C.:
The sonnet follows one of the weakest forms, and
one that is barely allowable. The matter is not
very interesting N.G. (Brighton) : Falls a long
way short... .L.A. (Chatswood): Better grow up a
bit first... .G.F.P.; Highly moral verse, but it’s a
kind we. don’t admire N.P. (AVaitara) : Sorrow-
ful tale written on both sides of the paper in metre
that slops and flops C.C. (Paddington): Terrible.
. ...M.P.; “Unachieved” has stretched too far
McDuff; “The Bread” nearly persuaded us. But in
the end we couldn’t swallow it.... C.P.D.; Light
weight. .. .A.G.L.: Good story spoiled by the fact that
“Mint Sauce” Jones was a tailor, not a barrister...,
Xuav; All off our beat. Items that, don’t touch Aus-
tralia at some point have small interest here....
H.R.M., Avon, Hup, C.8.L.: Quite printable; but
the competition to get on that page is very keen.
....John A.: Most of it has been said; and you’ve
not given your tribute much care. The thing that
is dashed off nearly always asks to be also dashed out.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R.L.H.: Don’t get the point. But here’s luck,
anyhow... .Hinkin: Afraid you learned your art in
the farmyard. You won’t go far till you scratch
less... .8.C.K.: It’s not so much a picture as a
diagram... .T.K.; Very primitive art; bedtime story
humor.
“P.T.”: Dr. Abrams's “electronic” con-
traption has many champions in the Queens-
land Labor party, owing to the barracking
in the party press, but a few outspoken mem-
bers are still sceptical. Randolph Bedford
put his own view briefly in Parliament:
“The Abrams machine, as far as I can see,
is a fake with a few wires to it.”
“Nitric”: The Brisbane gaols being filled
to overflowing, a number of striking seamen
are serving their sentences at St. Helena,
the island resort at the mouth of the Brisbane
River to which specially favored “long-term-
ers” are sent. The island is beautifully situ-
ated. Still, it has one qualification for a
penitentiary : escape is practically impos-
sible. Moreton Bay is shark-infested, and
the last prisoner who swam the channel to
the mainland escaped the sharks ofily to
succumb to the mosquitoes of the mangrove
beaches.

John A. Dewar, John Dewar and Sons, Perth,
Scotland.
‘‘lt’s an eye-opener, and I think will
eclipse anything ever held in the Southern
Hemisphere.”—Mr. H. J. Manson, New
Zealand Trade Commissioner at Melbourne.
“The New Zealand and South Seas
International Exhibition will be about a third
the size of Wembley, and those who have
seen Wembley will say that it is a big thing.
If New Zealand is putting up an Exhibition
a third of that size, she is also doing some-
thing on big lines.”—Captain Graham,
British Government Commissioner.
‘‘l felt justified in basing my ideas of
the Exhibition on the last Auckland one, but
I find that this is miles ahead of anything of
its kind I have seen. It is absolutely stagger-
ing in size. It will be a pleasure to me to
mention to Auckland people what a holiday
they can enjoy by coming to Dunedin this
summer.”—Mr. Albert Clark, Vice-president
Auckland Land Agents’ Association.
‘‘The progress that has been made is
amazing. The more one sees of the Exhibi-
tion, the more one realises that it is going
to be a wonderful show.”—Mr. N. Machin,
President Canterbury Chamber of Com-
merce.

'* Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both ! ”
Shakespeare knew the value of a good digestion— -
knew that it's not what you eat, but what you digest
that lays the foundation of health ——
But of all the distressing complaints that attack human beings,
Indigestion is by far the most commonplace. This depressing,
devitalising ailment is the deadly enemy of health and happiness,
for you can’t feel well when the digestive organs fail to function,
denying your body the necessary nourishment from the food you
eat. In this condition lassitude overcomes you, a morose, irritable
disposition sets in, your breath becomes offensive, the skin dry,
hard and withered : That’s Indigestion. But you can get
well —and quickly too —by the use of that Medical Gem
KRUSE’S .
pirjj ( lMa|!?esLa
One or two doses will convince you that you are taking the right
medicine. You will feel the difference as the stagnant secretions
are expelled, as they must be if you take the genuine Kruses
f m
This searching, though non-irritating aperient, more like a so rkhng mineral
water than a medicine, is healthful to people of all ages; and so pure that
it can safely be given to young infants

“Ben Zine” : Things have looked up for the
cattle-raiser. Peter Anderson, of Stirling,
50 miles south of Dunedin (M.L.), recently
sold a line of 200 fat bullocks at an average
of £27 10s. —£5500 for the mob. That will
take some beating.

“E.K.”: While Queensland hospitals do
not benefit by taxation of the sugar-workers,
it is bare justice to the A.W.U. to mention
that each member employed in the sugar
industry contributes a voluntary levy of
Id. in the £ for the l.ocal hospital and Id. in
the £ for the ambulance operating in the
district. I venture the opinion that the
sugar cocky does not pay ljd. in the £
taxation for the hospitals on his gross in-
come.
* * * *
“Clerk”: The Vic. Railways’ poultry-
farm at Noble Park has been in existence
since 1922, anjl supplies all the eggs and
dressed poultry, 'as well as a considerable
quantity of the vegetables, used in the de-
partment’s 40 refreshment-rooms and dining-
cars. The farm covers 16 acres, houses
3000 laying hens and 2000 Muscovy duck-
lings, and lias an annual output of 50,000
dozen eggs. T. Harding, a well-known
breeder of silver wyandottes and a judge at
the Royal Show, is manager.
“Percy Pawnticket”: Bunny got a stray
bit of limelight thrown upon him in the
Melbourne City Court when a shoplifter was
presented who had, in the cool manner of her
kind, invested herself in a fur coat in a city
store and walked out as if it was her own,
only to be pursued and captured. The firm
called it a “coney” coat, valued at £35;
but the shoplifter’s solicitor demanded to
know whether the fur was not that of the
rabbit. It was admitted that it was. And
the probability is that the pelt had to travel
to U.S.A. before the quid’s worth of rabbit-
skins was converted into “coney” and
ticketed for sale at a fancy price.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Away back in the early days
an enterprising person undertook to supply
native plants to the order of settlers who
might desire “to make a desirable present to
private friends or public botanical gardens at
home or abroad.” The quoted phrase is from
the advt. (1840) of Daniel Bunce, collecting
botanist, who announced that “at the shop of
Mr. Harington, chemist and druggist, Collins-
street, near the Club House,” his packets
of seeds, “accompanied with preserved speci-
mens of each plant in blossom and botanically
arranged and named,” could be had from
two guineas upward.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Maoriland’s Meat Producers’
Board enables residents of the Dominion to
make a direct gift to their friends in the
United Kingdom of a frozen carcase of lamb
or mutton, and the Dairy Produce Control
Board is falling into line. This Christmas
anyone paying 10s. to the office in Welling-
ton, accompanied by the name and address
of anyone in the United Kingdom, may have
41b. of butter delivered at the right place.
The butter will be made up in a carton,
enclosed in a larger carton; literature extoll-
ing the virtues of Maoriland will be used as
packing. M.L. believes in broadcasting
abroad the guid conceit she has o’ hersel’.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Judgment in the Bank of
N.S.W. v. Anderson cheque case, in which
what the Judge termed “the perilous finance”
of C. J. De Garis was involved, went against
the plaintiffs. The verdict amounted to a
decision that the bank knew that the cheque
was part of a financial juggle and that the
drawer was exceeding his warranty. The
judgment, however sound, will tend to shake
the sense of security which acceptors of
cheques may feel in regard to the re-
sponsibility of people who sign such docu-
ments and leave others to fill in the amounts.
The usual contention is that the man who
takes such a risk does it with his eyes open;
anyway, it is a simple matter to limit the
possibility of an abuse of confidence by mark-
ing the cheque “Not exceeding"—whatever
amount he fixes upon as his limit.
* * * *
“Two Seas”: Some pleasantly frank
advice from an article in a well-known trade
journal upon the art of selling fruit: “Wipe
the bananas when they look dull and dusty
with a cloth sprinkled with a few drops of
oil. Sew’ing-machine oil will do if you have
no other. If you get any small oranges which
have cost you a penny each, and you don’t
like to charge that amount for them, boil
them for about ten minutes in clear, hard
water, and they will swell almost twice their
normal size. Polish your apples and wrap
some white tissue-paper round the bottom of
them. It makes them look more attractive
and hides blemishes.” Note that the inno-
cent Dago is not instructed to boil ha’penny
oranges into penny ones, but it is possible
that the idea might occur to him.
* * * *
“Kerogen” : Apropos S. C. O. Jessop’s pro-
posal to can the surplus Australian horse
(B. 15/10/’25). Alleged “beef extract” is
often largely extract of horse. In
parts of South America it is usual
to “render down” the unwanted animal.
I have handled tons of horse-fat, and
would defy anyone to detect it in
admixture with tallows and neatsfoot oil;
and, treated by hydrogenation, hardened
horse-oil is far superior to hardened whale-
oil, the basis of lots of our margarines and
cooking-fats. Army rations since the days
of Hannibal have contained horse in some
form or another, and I agree with S. C. O.
Jessop that canned brumby, if you close your
eyes, tastes just as nice as the bovine article.
There would be big money in the horse-
killing industry if one could overcome the
color and tendency to stringiness of the pro-
duct. In Europe they are much more alive
to the commercial possibilities of dead horse
than we are. Good salesmanship at the other
end would sell our horse products just as it
does our beef. Sentiment should not enter
into the question at all. If the value of the
beasts for working, racing or any other pur-
pose falls below two figures it is an econo-
mic fallacy to graze them except for the
abattoirs.

Every Plumber Knows This.
A LL plumbers know that there are very
f~\ few tube fittings which can be
crushed flat by a power hammer
without fracturing. Wrought fittings will
not stand this test. Ordinary malleable
fittings break into a dozen pieces with
such a blow. —| — G.F.'—|— Malleable fit-
tings, however, come through this test
crushed flat but not cracked in the slight-
est. This toughness is due to the close-
grained British iron from which they are
made and the special annealing process
we employ. Every -|- G.F. —|- fitting
undergoes as a standard test the applica-
tion of 3001 b. pressure; only one in a
million fails. The -J- G.F. —|— fittings
that pass our severe test are sold to you

nm,
If you could shave
yourself in three min-
utes as well as the
barber does, wouldn’t
you rather always do
so than waste valuable
time at a barber’s
shop?
Then try a PERFOR-
ATED HONE. It puts easy
shaving within reach of every
man. Requires no skill or
experience to use. Give six
strokes or a hundred—you
can’t hurt your razor, for the
perforations prevent WIRE-
EDGE, and automatically
produce a perfect, keen shaving edge.
TRY ONE. If it doesn’t make your
razor shave to your satisfaction return
it to us within 30 days and get your
money back.

“8.E.C.”: How about this for a shearing-
shed record? R. Kay commenced wool-
classing at East Loddon, Serpentine (Yic.)»
36 years ago. He has been back every year
since, never missed a day through illness and
is still as active as the best. At home he
runs a light farm at Avoca. East Loddon
shears 30,000 sheep and runs a bourd of 14
shearers.
“Simon”: Old Henry Parkes always used
to pretend that he neither noticed nor read
anything that the late W. P. Crick might say.
Once Crick caught him quoting from some
published remarks of his. “I thought you
never read my speeches,” said Crick. “Well,”
piped Parkes, “my attention was called to
it.” “By the Governor?” queried Crick.
“No,” says Parkes, “by the police.”
“Kriz”: The Westralian Pearlers’ Associa-
tion, formed in 1902, has a membership this
year of 57 pearlers owning 147 vessels of
a total of 180 working out of Broome. A
little while back the association planned to
train men to become divers, as the shortage
was becoming acute. A lugger has been fitted
up, with an experienced man in charge, and
a number of imported Chinese have been
taken out to the grounds. The cost is met
by a levy on all the members.
Bert Hinkler, the Australian airman now
in England, is a Bundaberg (Q.) native
and began flying in a home-made glider at
Burnett Heads many years ago. When he
returned from the war he telegraphed to his
mother that he would come right along to
see her; the same evening lie dropped out
of the clouds at the front gate, having flown
from Sydney—non-stop—in a Baby Avro.
A panel or so of fence was pulled down and
Bert hunted the fowls out of a shed to use
it for a temporary aerodrome. Pie astonished
his old schoolmates next day by flying under
the railway and road bridges across the
Burnett.
“Clerk”: Victoria has the largest and
most up-to-date produce terminal in Aus-
tralia in the new hay, chaff and potato
sheds just opened at Cowper-street, front-
ing Victoria Dock. The two sheds cover
six acres, and 95 trucks can be handled sim-
ultaneously. Water-supply, sewerage, fire-
service, telephones and electric light have
been installed, and a new r w r ood-blocked
road, 99 feet wide, laid from Flinders-street.
Two hundred men have been employed on
the construction work for the past two
years, and more than 180 tons of galvan-
ised iron and 423 tons of steel were used, the
total cost being £150,000.
According to Wickens, only five women in
the Commonwealth were qualified lawyers
when his last count was made (several have
been added since), but no less than 2340 were
clerks in law offices. There were 386 women
doctors, and 89 others were qualifying; and
there were five qualified architects among the
sex. The rather startling number of 348
claimed to make a living as artists. There
were 13 women chauffeurs ; six who ran pawn-
broking establishments, five animal-trappei's,
14 beekeepers and 12 undertakers; and
although there seems to be a perpetual short-
age of Mary Anns, 1405 out of the 35,560
women classified as domestic servants said
they were out of a job.
“Coot” ; A vast number of casual Austra-
lians have opened accounts in the Common-
wealth Bank and apparently forgotten all
about them. The majority have only a few
pounds to their credit, but Pal Singh, of
Westralia, has had £991 in the bank’s cus-
tody for many years and given no indication
of remembering it. Herbert Edward Baker,
of Brisbane, deposited £32S, and hasn’t
troubled to operate on the account; and the
same applies to Frank William Lewis, of
Melbourne, who has a credit balance of £274.
There are in all over a thousand accounts
which have not been troubled by their own-
ers for over seven years; if no claim is made
after ten years have elapsed the bank can
pouch the amount at credit.
“Hugh Ituporos” (Ilobart) : Of course
we think “Only Australian” is quite wrong
to rank our harbor after Sydney. Except
during thick fogs, which do not occur on
more than four or five days in the year, the
largest vessel afloat could enter the river
and berth within a few hundred yards of
the Hobart Post Office under her own steam
—II.M.S. Hood did it last year—at any hour
of the day or night. The entrance to the
Derwent is nearly three miles wide, and has
a minimum depth of 42ft. with a fairly wide
channel of 54ft. This width is maintained
right up to Hobart, while the depth in-
creases ; and there is just sufficient bend in
the river to make the harbor landlocked.
Above Hobart the river narrows, but is still
nearly a mile wide; at Risdon, three miles
further up, there is a depth of 60ft. The
facilities for movement in the Derwent are
so great that it is a port without tugs; and
there is hardly a rock or a shoal worth men-
tioning in the whole 14 miles from the Iron
Pot to Risdon. Finally, for every acre of
85-foot water in Port Jackson there must be
at least 20 acres of 50-foot water in Hobart
harbor.
The two £2OOO jobs just grabbed by
Queensland politicians are all the more con-
spicuous because tall poppies are not plen-
tiful in the North’s public-service garden.
The salary list is headed by the Governor,
£3000; Chief Justice, £2250; other Judges,
£2OOO. The Commissioner of Railways is
the only other public servant on the £2OOO
mark. Then there is a big drop to the
Agent-General and the Public Service Com-
missioner, £l5OO each. The Premier draws
£1300; other Ministers, £lOOO each. Other
thousand-pounders are the Lieutenant-Gover-
nor, the Speaker, the Auditor-General, the
Government Printer, the Commissioner of
Public Health, the Chairman of the Main
Roads Board, and the general manager of
the Central Sugar Mills. Three of the
Under-Secretaries (Home Department, Jus-
tice and Mines) are on the £lOOO mark;
most of the others get £9QO. The Commis-
sioner of Taxes, the Commissioner for Trade,
the Engineer for Harbors and Rivers and the
Inspector of Hospitals for the Insane each
gets £llOO. The only other salaries above
£lOOO are; State Insurance Commissioner,
£1300; cotton specialist. £1250; Chief Rail-
way Engineer, £l2OO. The general manager
of the Northern railway division gets £lOOO,
with quarters; other general managers £lOO
to £3OO less. Members of the Land Court
cut up £3OOO between themselves. No one
else gets into the £lOOO class.

In Six Months Time
Studebaker Standard Six Coach
Production Increases 458 Per Cent
February
March
April
HAT automobile purchasers throughout the
; world were quick to recognize and appreciate
the exceptional value of the Studebaker Stand"
ard Six Coach is evidenced by this fact —
In order to meet the demand, it was
necessary to increase July production
to nearly six times that of February
—an increase of 458%.
The Standard Six Coach, like all Studebakers, is a
one-profit car. There are but two American automo-
bile manufacturers who build cars complete —Stude-
baker in the fine car field and Ford in the low priced
field. By making all its own bodies, engines, springs,
axles, clutches, gear boxes, differentials, steering gears,
gray iron castings and drop forgings, Studebaker pro-
duces a perfectly co-ordinated car and eliminates the
profits of outside makers. Savings thus made enable
Studebaker to use finer steels, and better materials
throughout, without charging prices in proportion
to quality.

Rexona
Soap
It’s Medicated!
Miss EUGENIE GILBERT, a beautiful
Rexona Girl and pronounoed by Rodolph
Valentino to be the most beautiful of all
Movie Stars in Hollywood, says: “No-
thing eases and relieves the burn of a hot
day at the beach like Rexona Soap.”
Surfing Time is
Rexona Time!
To all lovers of outdoor sports a dip in the roar-
ing breakers on a summer’s day is indeed romance.
Next day the sunburnt, blistered hands and scarlet
face are painful realities. This distress can be
avoided by the application of soothing-, cooling,
healing Rexona, the Rapid Healer, to the face,
hands and arms.
Try the following treatment after your swim, and
you will be delighted with the happy results. First
bathe the face, hands and arms in fresh water, mak-
ing a good lather with Rexona Soap. Massage
with this, then softly dry and apply Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, gently to the skin. If this is done
there will be no after-effects from exposure to the
sun, no regrets after a happy day, for the skin,
soothed by the wonderful influence of Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, will quickly regain its normal tem-
perature and comfortable coolness.
You will find Rexona Skin and Facial Soap ideal
as a shampoo for the hair after your dip.
Rexona Soap and Rexona, the Rapid Healer, in
its dainty pot, -should stand on the toilet table of
all who indulge in outdoor sports.

The Secret Lover.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
nyy UNLIKE as lone Heloise,
Mid the summer hum of bees,
- a - 1 By Love’s questing eyes unseen,
Lily read in linnet green.
All her book was brown with age;
White dreams bloomed on every page.
Fairy wine too sweet to sip
From the wild words seemed to drip.
Like the phantom of a wood
Sitting in a leafy hood,
Lost in holy loveliness,
Lily read, in her green dress:
“Ladye, ladye, laughter dwells,
Hushed as little blossom bells,
All along the leaves you turn;
Turn your eyes, lest mine should bium! '
But the nunlike Lily reads,
Nor her secret lover heeds,
Singing softly in her ear
Forest songs of a green fear.
Richer grows the tale and rare
Of a ladye wondrous fair—
She enchanted on a day
Lost a million years away—
“ Barley bread he brought her in,
Set it in a wooden bin.
Wine they drank; and when they sang
Spring from winter slumber sprang.”
So she read and turned the leaf—
“Ladye, ladye, bride of grief,
Look at me!” She only said
“Poetry is holy bread.”
“Ladye, ladye, I am here.”
From the book in elfin fear
Out her secret lover leapt.
Nunlike Lily sighed and wept.
From his lips she sipped the bliss
Of a red enchanted kiss.
Love, who sought her, sought in vain;
Lily dreamed away again.
Like a leafy dryad now
Underneath a rose-red bough—
Comely April, madcap May—-
Lily reads the livelong day.
Bleating lambs the valley fill;
Black kids plunge along the hill.
Root, nor weed, nor herb nor flower
Charm her from her story bowrnr.
Love, with many a longing look,
Sighs upon her open book.
“Ladye,” wooes her wild book lover
Safe between each rosy cover.
ner he feeds on spicy things
To the murmurous lisp of wings
Floating in a stilly tune
Underneath an olden moon.
Flowery lanes of a lost day
Twenty thousand worlds away,
Stars above the balconies,
June joy under lilac-trees —
These she knows and something more,
Strolling by a fairy shore.
Leafy altars, sleepy kine
Glimmer through the woodland vine.
Dulcet songs of ladies fair.
Barons bold without a care,
Baskets of lush loveliness—
These are in each leaf’s caress.
And for ever, skylark clear.
Through the laughter of the year,
“Ladye, ladye, ladye sweet!”
Sings that lover at her feet.
“Lily, turn and look at me,
Lily made for poesy!
Lily, in my eyes behold
That which never may grow old!”
“Ladye, ladye, ladye dear.
Do not heed him, do not hear!
What can mortal lover give
When immortal you may live?
“Spicy, heights of autumn call;
Climb across my wizard wall.
Ladye, ladye, by my spell
In my secret garden dwell.”
Lily listens like a maid
Under charm of faery laid;
Lily would give Love her hand
At his earnest, quick command ;
But her phantom lover wooes.
“Ladye, ladye!”.... Will she choose
Crying love with human eyes
Or her ghost of Paradise?
N.s.w.
ZORA CROSS.
Law and Order.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BRADSHAW was vastly indignant.
To be hit in the eye with a potato;
a plebeian potato ! It was more than
too much; and it emphasised the need for
change in the police force of Embar. He
would get it changed all right: they
need not fear about that. Too long, by years,
Lad Embar run on the down grade through
the incapacity of that drunken mountain.
Sergeant Shale, and his more hopeless lieu-
tenant, the constable.
It had come to a pretty pass when a decent,
respectable citizen, the owner and editor
of the Embar Chronicle, could not
leave his house for the office after the even-
ing meal without being hit in the eye with a
potato. Where the offending tuber came
from he was uncertain, but it was not the
first thing of the kind that had happened
in Embar that week, and it was going to
stop. Only two nights before a crowd of
lawless hoodlums had made the night hideous
outside the very door of the Chronicle
while he was reading proofs for the next
day’s issue. And when he had gone out to
protest, what had they done? Poured a dis-
gusting bottle of beer over the head of a
mangy dog and christened the confounded
animal Chronicle! Shale hadn’t arrested
one of them. Of course he hadn’t: most
likely he’d have been with them if he hadn't
got too drunk after hours in the Commercial
earlier the same night.
It was preposterous. He hit viciously at
a geranium that was drinking in the twilight
from the top of the picket fence flanking
the footpath. A spider’s web, stretched
across the path about five feet from the
ground, threw its clammy net over his nose
and mouth. As his hand shot up angrily
to remove it, a football kicked over the fence
of a vacant allotment lodged tentatively be-
tween his slightly bandy knees and brought
him down heavily on his stomach. Snorting
with rage he got up again, brushed the dust
savagely from his white waistcoat and swore
vehemently that the lawlessness of Embar
would not last another fortnight.
As he fumed round the corner of Prince-
street his ferret eyes caught a long, imper-
turbable-looking ruffian red-handed in the
act of theft. Two hundred yards up Alison-
street the scoundrel was lifting from the
front of the Chronicle office the black,
tombstone-shaped board upon which Brad-
shaw pasted notices of all funerals adver-
tised in the Chronicle, thereby generously
giving to every person who died in Embar,
irrespective of caste, creed or estate, a free
advertisement. No one could accuse him of
any lack of generosity. Underneath his
white vest his colossal vanity and his splut-
tering temper there was quite a lot of kind-
liness in his heart, as many living in Embar
could testify. It was the increasing law-
lessness in a town which through length of
residence he had come to regard as more or
less his own property that violated his gods.
Here he was, not a quarter of an hour
from home, hit in the eye with a dastardly
potato, tripped by a vrretched football; and
now theft! He stood and thrust his double-
chinned face forward incredulously. He
knew the thief; it was one Clugg, a man
with an unhealthy reputation as a grass
pugilist. Well, he could afford to watch
him. And if Shale didn’t act on that case
he would take some of the stripes off Shale’s
arm.* Leisurely Clugg took the squat black
board down from its nail, walked across the
street and hung it deliberately over the brass
plate of Embar’s leading medical practitioner,
Dr. Septimus R. Casselling.
Bradshaw waited until Clugg, after sur-
veying his work carefully, had turned, ap-
parently satisfied, and sauntered up the
street. Then he walked across in the gath-
ering gloom and rescued the board. Luckily
it was nearly dark and there was no one in
the Chronicle office to see him and gossip
the incident about Embar.
He lit the gas in the poky office and
settled down to his desk. There was a
harshness about his customarily friendly
mouth that boded no good to certain citizens
of Embar. He was determined to root out
the evils that threatened the structure of
law and order. He had no modest doubts
about the influence of the Chronicle ; one
fearless leader would do it. With the cool
breeze from the river floating in through the
open door behind him he settled down to
write.
“Since the Chamber of Commerce three
years ago drew attention to the paucity of
police and the increasing lawlessness of
Embar, dastardly depredations on person
and property have in no whit diminished.”
He paused and ran his eye over the sentence
approvingly ; twenty-five years in the editorial
chair of the Chronicle had not lessened
his admiration for the printed word, as
written by Bradshaw. “Indeed,” he went
on, his voice rising as he warmed up to the
job and jerking his words out aloud as his
pen scratched them on to the paper—“indeed
they are rapidly increasing and the police
seem powerless to compel”
The noise' of enormous bulk falling behind
Bradshaw caused him to leap from his chair,
grab the lead-weighted copy-spike and stand
ready to defend himself. Sight of the uni-
form made him feel safer, but it was a
belligerent voice that muttered from the
floor something that sounded like “Wastliat-
yergottersayaboutpolice?” Unsteadily Ser-
geant Shale got on to his feet, and, gripping
the side of the desk, glared at Bradshaw.
He repeated his demand.
“I have to say this,” Bradshaw told him
emphatically—“the police of Embar are a
disgrace, Sergeant Shale, and you ought to
be ashamed of yourself to come floundering
into my office in this drunken condition.”
“Talkinthroughyerneck,” said Sergeant
Shale.
“Now look here,” Bradshaw commanded
sternly, “we have had about enough of this
kind of thing in Embar. Either you pull
yourself together or you’re going out.”
Sergeant Shale blinked down on him. Then
he put two gigantic thumbs into two cavern-
ous ears and waggled seven fingers and
k half playfully. Bradshaw reached up
and gripped the two massive shoulders. Be-
fore the spectacle of the thoroughly intoxi-
cated Shale his anger was ebbing fast. He
felt sorry for the man. In another year or
two, anyway, Shale would have to retire
from the force on passing the age limit, and
there, was a pension to be considered. Brad-
shaw was the w r rong sort to destroy another
man’s life-hopes if he could help it; even
putting up with further lawlessness would
be preferable to that. He shook the big chap
firmly and not unkindly.
“Shale,” he said, “you must ease up. You
know what it will mean if you lose your
job, and you’re going the right way about
losing it. Take a pull, old chap.”
“Goodole Bradshaw,” Sergeant Shale
gurgled. “Talklikecockatoo. Oughterbein
Parliament.”
Bradshaw attempted to shake him again,
but with a strategic lurch Shale evaded him
and collapsed into the editorial chair, where
he immediately commenced to snore with
great industry. With some difficulty Brad-
shaw shook him into a state of semi-sensi-
bility again.
“D’you hear, Shale?” he shouted between
vigorous shakes. “I’m going to see you to
the station. You can’t sleep here, and I’ve
got some work to do that has to be done
to-night.”
Mention of the station bore an urgent
message into the befuddled brain of Sergeant
Shale. “I'll beorright,” he said. “Get the -e-
-onmeown.”

This Might Happen Any Day.
ACCIDENTS occur when least ex-
pected—the kettle or pan that boils
over —the slip with the knife or tin-
opener—the hot oven door against your
bare arm —the twisted ankle on the stairs
—and the children’s cut and bruises.
An efficient and the most compact
first-aid ever known consists of a box of
that ever-ready healer, Zam-Buk.
First wash away any dirt or grit
from the wound; cover it with a
piece of lint or any bit of clean
rag on which some Zam-Buk has
been spread. Rub gently with
Zam-Buk for bruises and sprains.
Keep covered up (especially in
burns and sealJs), and let Nature
and Zam-Buk do the rest.
Pain is quickly soothed by the Zam-
Buk, inflammation and swelling are
allayed, and the germs present in all
wounds are prevented from setting up
blood-poisoning. The growth of a new
covering of healthy skin proceeds apace,
and very soon all trace of the injury is
quietly but effectively removed.
It is important to select Zam-Buk
because it means safety first. Unlike many
ointments, Zam-Buk contains no coarse
mineral drug or rancid animal fat to
corrode the skin. #
SCALDED BY BOILING COFFEE.
“I touched the handle of a pot of coffee which was
standing on the stove,” says Miss M. L. Miller, of 4

A SURGERY in a 2-INCH BOX
Slowly Bradshaw assisted the uniformed
figure to its feet and, piloting it to the foot-
path, pulled-to the office door behind them.
Then, with linked arms, they set out at a
lurching gait to go to the station, under
Bradshaw’s sober pilotage, via the more
unfrequented of Embar’s lanes and back
streets.
The station was not half a mile away, but
it was more than an hour later that they
crossed into the cobbled yard, bordered on
one side by a row of empty cells and on the
other by the living quarters of the force.
There had been many halts on the way, to
avoid pedestrians, to debate grotesque prob-
lems that arose in the mind of Shale, and
for other reasons. The strenuousness of the
laSt hour had practically exhausted Brad-
shaw, but he piloted his charge through the
gateless entrance, thankful in his heart that
they had met no one that mattered on the
way. The further they had gone the more
his anger diminished, until he had decided
that Shale was not such a bad fellow, after
all; a little wild, perhaps, but certainly not
the right subject for the annihilating powers
of the Chkonicle’s leader columns.
Inside the courtyard comprehension be-
gan to dawn upon Sergeant Shale. For the
first time in many hours he knew where he
was, what and who he was. Suddenly he
took in the whole situation. He turned
decisively toward Bradshaw', grabbed him by
the collar and flung him into the third cell.
There was a little groping for the imdlock.
and, as the lock snipped, an angry and
indignant yell startled the darkness of No. 8.
“Drunkens\yine,” Sergeant Shale shouted
at the cell door. “Disgrace t’lawan’order
Embar.”
, Then with the consciousness of duty well
done, he lurched across to the verandah of the
living quarters, stumbled over the steps and
snored triumphantly at the stars.
CECIL MANN.
The Strength of the Weak.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
pale light of a lantern gleamed
steadily from a window of the farm-
house, and from time to time, as he
paced restlessly down at the bottom 'of
the horse paddock along the bank of the
creek, John Wylde paused to glance half
fearfully towards its yellow radiance.
Around him was the stillness of the bush
by night, broken only by the soft ripple of
waters down the bed of the creek, and the
rustle of an unseen animal through the
undergrowth that fringed the steep clay
banks. Above lay the countless points of
the stars, pricked in silver against a velvet
sky, and a strangely distorted moon swam
mistily through a fleecy lining of cloud low
down towards the horizon.
Wylde was a man with the weight of
years upon him, and the lines that told
their story of struggle and hardship mark-
ing his face. Just now it was furrowed
with additional lines, and there was an
expression of dull pain in his eyes that he
had brought away from the house to hide
from his wife. It was always the way.
In the hard rounds of daily life lie was the
dominating figure, the man who controlled
the routine of the farm, who ordered the
destiny of his people, and would brook no
opposition. But in the dark hours came the
slender figure of his wife, the little woman
with the tired face and the eyes that still
shone strangely above the delicately chiselled
nose and the wistful mouth, with the lumin-
ous depth of youth that had set the years
at defiance. In the moment of crisis she
took charge, quietly and unobtrusively,
allowing the weight of responsibility to fall
on her shoulders with the natural fearless-
ness of a mother who tends her first baby
with no experience to show her the way.
Up in the farmhouse, in the little room
where the lantern shone, sat Mary Wylde
at the bedside of Alec, her youngest son.
The doctor had called and gone, and there
was nothing to do now but wait —and dream
back through the dead years as only a
mother can dream. These dreams were
essential just now, for the stark reality of
the present would swamp her heroic self-
control if she dwelt on it too long, and sweep
her across the border of hysteria into an
emotional chaos.
A mother’s dreams are all of her children,
and there was bitterness in hers. She had
borne five sons, a bonnie baby every one, who
had grown up in the sunshine and clean
air of the open spaces to stalwart manhood.
She had been very proud of them. They
were so big and brown and strong, and she
was so small —a mere wisp of a woman
moving in a household of deep-voiced and
sun-tanned giants. She had loved the sense
of protection it brought her, yet knowing
all the time that she was the strongest
of them all, that these great, heavy-limbed
sons came to her with their dreams and
their troubles just as did their silent, grirn-
faced father.
That had been in the golden days. But
later had come a shadow that lay heavily
upon the farmhouse and across all the land.
At the first hint of war the two eldest sons
had journeyed to Sydney and enlisted. Both
lads figured in the landing at Gallipoli, and
one of them —quiet, good-natured Tom, the
eldest —had left his life-blood on the fateful
ridges. Two more sons left for the Front,
and again one of them made the supreme
sacrifice. They had been dark days for the
little mother waiting back there on the
lonely selection —days when the sun seemed
to shine but wanly, and when even the song
of birds were tuned to a sadder key. But
hope and a latent faith in the efficacy of
the sacrifice had kept her bravely up, until
the shadow moved away and two' war-weary
and strangely altered men returned to the
old farmhouse.
For a ti,me Mary Wylde had believed her-
self happy, but all the while a new fear was
troubling her sensitive soul. The two boys
who had returned were full of stories of
strange lands and stirring days. They had
broken away from the narrow horizons of
the old life, and had tasted the thrills of the
new. And as the first months dragged by
they came finally to chafe against the oJd
barriers, and long, with all the force of their
restless spirits, for the stir and bustle to
which the railway-station ten miles away
was the key.
For a long time their mother could glimpse
the inevitable parting somewhere in !the
future, and for a long time her love-hungry
soul rebelled at the thought. But when the
time came, and the father was strong in his
anger at the very suggestion, it was she who
came to him and pleaded, telling him bravely
that their future must be considered, that
they were masters of their own destinies,
and that it was but selfishness to stand in
their way. And so she sent them off with a
smile on her face and a bitter sorrow tugging
at her heart. There were promises of let-
ters and a probable return in a year or two ;
but the letters soon dwindled and finally
ceased altogether, and the outer world swal-
lowed them.
There was still the youngest son, and on
him the little woman lavished the full
strength of her passionate motlier-love. It
seemed, too, that it would not be all in vain,
as it had been with his brothers. Alec was a
quiet lad, with little interest in the world be-
yond the boundaries of the farm. He loved
the quiet places and the glades of the bush
with an intensity that augured well for the
future. The little things of life seemed to
content him, and in the work of the selec-
tion he was an invaluable help to his father.
His mother dreamed of keeping him always
near her. It was true he would marry some
day; but her mother’s heart whispered that
he had already made his choice, and that
one day he would bring little Alice Dawe
back to the homestead as his wife. She had
watched this attachment grow, sensing in
her quiet way the strong love springing to
life in her boy. And Alice? She was a win-
some girl, with honest eyes and a warm
mouth, and in her position as teacher of the
little school in the hollow she had made a
place for herself in the district. But, in
any case, any girl that Alec loved must have
much good in her.
And then, only a few months ago, Alice
had resigned suddenly, and left the place
without as much as a word of farewell to
anyone; and it was said that she had gone
to the city to seek a better position. In
those days a heavy shadow had set its seal
on Alec’s face; but when his mother ques-
tioned him in her gentle way, he had smiled
quietly and patted her hand reassuringly.
“She will come back, mother,”* he had said.
“Every girl wants to get away for a little
while. But she will come back.”
So she had waited, watching her son with
jealous eyes, sensing every mood, and fear-
ing, in her innermost heart, that his love
would drive him away in search of Alice.
But he had stuck to his work doggedly—
until that day had come swift tragedy. A
refractory horse—flying heels, iron shod —
and Alec had been carried in from an outer
paddock unconscious. For a long time, as
she tended him mechanically, she refused to
believe that this terrible thing had really
happened. And later, after the doctor had
called and shaken his head and had done
the little that could be done, she had spent
long, heart-breaking hours —now praying
feverishly, now protesting fiercely to Bod
at the cruel injustice of it all. Could it be
that the labor and the cares of motherhood
must always end in sacrifice? She felt dully
that life could hold nothing for her if this
tragedy reached its culmination. Her brave
little mother’s soul wilted before the thought,
and hot, protesting tears and desperate
prayer kept with her through the long hours.
The end came with the dawn, when all
the world seemed hushed for the passing. It
came suddenly, with a movement on the bed,
and then a soft sigh as the dark head fell
back.
Very calmly Mary Wylde closed the eyes
so strikingly like her own, and quietly she
walked to the window and blew out the
lantern still burning sceadily. Then she
stood motionless in the darkened room, her
eyes gazing out through the windows at the
thin line of grey in the east, where a glow
of color would soon speak with such bitter
mockery of a new day—and life. There
was nothing more to be done. Her prayers
had been refused.
The kookaburras were breaking the still-
ness with their morning song outside the
house as John Wylde came in to his wife.
Very gently he drew the little woman into
his arms, and softly, though with a voice
that trembled, he whispered halting words of
sympathy.
“I saw the light go out, Mary,” he said.
She nodded wearily.
“It is the end, John.”
He did not look at the bed, but drew his
wife gently towards the kitchen.
“There is someone outside,” he said, “wait-
ing to see you.”
She went with him listlessly, her feet
dragging heavily over the bare boards, until
her husband left her at the outer door, where
a small figure was waiting. Mary Wylde
looked down at her vaguely, and then a new
light sprang suddenly into her eyes.
“Alice!” she cried.
The girl looked up at her with parted
lips and eager eyes, that shone nevertheless
with a queer conflict of expression—-with
pain, and joy, and doubt. The older woman
would have gathered her in her arms had
she had not seen what had escaped her first
glance. A small bundle lay in the girl’s
arms, and a tiny pink fist waved suddenly as
Mary took a step nearer.
She looked at Alice with widening eyes,
and when she spoke her voice was strangely
hushed, as though in that hour of sadness she
had no right to express this new joy.
“Alice —my dear?”
“It is Alec’s son,” she whispered.
Her big eyes were swimming with tears,
but beneath them they pleaded desperately as
they met Mary’s gaze.
But there was no need for pleading. Gently
the little old woman’s arms went about her,
and her voice was vibrant with a new hope,
a new purpose in a life that seemed but a
moment ago to hold nothing but ashes.
“Come inside, Alice,” she said very softly.
