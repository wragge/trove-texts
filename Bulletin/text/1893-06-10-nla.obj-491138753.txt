This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears hia name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe.
He has devoted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTS’ YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. Ills practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

THE
NAMBROK ESTATE,
situated on the Latrobe River, Cippsland
comprises 15,000 acres of very rich land
which can scarcely be surpassed for agri-
cultural, fattening and dairy purposes. The
land is specially adapted for the growth of
maize, hops, root crops and cereals, and is
practically ready for the plough. Th&
Nambrok sheep and cattle have been for
many years noted for the excellence and
high prices obtained. The rainfall is abun-
dant, averaging about 30 inches per annum,
and the climate salubrious, being free from
extreme heat and cold. An Unlimited
supply of water can be obtained at a mode-
rate depth, under 30 feet, in any portion of
the Estate.
The Thompson River, which is close to
the northern boundary of the property, can
be easily and cheaply utilised for irrigation'
purposes. The Rosedale Railway Station,
111 miles from Melbourne, is within 2|
miles of the property, and the railway line
runs directly through the property, and
the Heyfield station on the Maffra line is
about 5 miles distant.
THE
MELTON PARK ESTATE
comprises 7146 acres, close to Bacchus
Marsh, in the Parish of Yancardook,
County of Bourke, and is well known ip
Victoria for its great fertility and resi-
dential attractions. It is about a couple of
miles from the Melton Railway Station,
20 miles distant from Melbourne, where ap
ever ready market exists for everything
the Estate produces.

several years, afflicted with Eczema; none of the
many remedies prescribed by the physicians doing
fdfd
her any good. When we had about given up all
hope of curing her, my wife suggested the use of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. We tried it, and before one
bottle had been taken, a great change for the
better was noticeable. We continned the treat-
ment, and a thorough cure was the result.”
“My daughter, long a sufferer from salt-rheum,
was comp etely cured by the use of Ayer’s Sarsap-
arilla.”— Maria R. dk Kins, Calpulalpam, Mexico.

On SOROFULOSIS.—VoI. XVI.
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be

It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy

This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

A London Panic in ’70.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
France was daring Germany to tread on
the tails of its Napoleonic eagles. The London
summer was choky and sweaty, but the London
Stock Exchange rules requiring all its visitants to
wear belltoppers remained inexorable. (Any un-
orthodox hat is promptly footballed by the
“gentlemen” of the Exchange.) Likewise, the
etiquette of black-cloth frock-coats was in force.
The huge building that forms the head-quarters
of what is generally known as the Money Market
is situated in the centre of an irregular triangle,
bounded by Bartholomew Lane (where, from the
opposite side of the street the Bank of England
frowns on its main entrance, Capel Court), Throg-
morton-street, and Threadneedle-street and its
continuation. Daily meeting within its walls are
some 1000 members and clerks. Gorgeously-
attired waiters resplendent in black-cloth liveries,
with red-cloth facings, gold-lace streaks and brass-
buttons, are seated inside its portals, to prevent
the entrance of any save “members” of the
“House,” or those of their clerks who have
passed the ordeal imposed by the “Committee,”
or the specially-registered telegraph-messengers.
On 19th July, ’7O, the simmering distrust in
London financial circles reached its climax. On
that date, France declared war against Prussia.
I visited the “ Market ” that morning, telling
a liveried Cerberus my business. I was allowed to
stand alongside this gorgeous creature’s seat,
while he yelled in stentorian tones —“ Smith !
Smith! Jones! Jones! A. B. Smith! C. D.
Jones!”
Other criers took up the names, until Jones,
flurried and heated, slipped for a moment from
his “ market,” only to inform me that he could not
leave. Would I wait? He would send Smith.
Consols had dropped three-eighths; and, if war
was declared, they’d go down another one per
cent. Rails were down two per cent, all round.
And then he rushed madly inside again.
Suddenly an irresistible gust of new-comers
swept into the building. Amid a babel roar, the
ear could catch spurts of intelligibility—“ Sell
20,000 at a quarter ! Sell 40,000 at an eighth !
Sell 50,000 at a sixteenth ! ”
A sudden lull.
“ War has been declared.”
Then a rush to the doors for newspapers.
Presently, a circle was formed under the great
dome, and a well-trained voice was heard enthusi-
astically singing “The Marseillaise,” the chorus
of which was excitedly taken up by a thousand
throats.
Then the pent-up feelings of the stock-gamblers
broke loose ! Men heretofore supposed to be hard-
headed and level-brained jumped on their hats
savagely, wrung their hands despairingly, plucked
at their beards, and yelled like chained lunatics 1
Frantic apparitions dashed hither and thither,
screaming—“Sell, sell!”
Three o’clock struck. The watchmen at each
door sprung their rattles, men lighted cigars and
calmed down, and business yawned. Four o'clock,
and business was over for the day.
Men worth thousands in the morning went
home ruined.
» # •
A few days later was the fortnightly
settling-day. .
Business was noisily humming. Eleven o clock
struck. There was a hush. The head-waiter rose
in his place against the great pillar, almost in the
centre of the building. All eyes were fixed on
him, tall, erect, white-headed, clean-shaven,, and
with an irreproachable clean collar showing in
contrast to the old-fashioned black “stock.” He
had removed his hat. He tapped once with a
wooden hammer —the hush became stiller ; twice
—it was as the sibilance of a collective whisper j
thrice —it was absolute and painful.
“Gentlemen, Mr. A. B. Smith begs to inform
the House that he cannot comply with his
b3ir^9iinBt //
Amid dead silence, a similar formula was gone
through with C. D. Jones, E. F. Browne, G. H.
Robinson, right up to Y. Z. Fit^Fortescue.
Then , there was a mad stir, and a rushing
around of wild-eyed men to see how they stood
with the defaulters, and a second edition of the
post-Marsellaise agony was enacted,
• • •
A few weeks, however, settled that panic.
Crushed France and victorious Germany both
ordered their chiefest supplies from British manu-
facturers, and freetraders claimed the local revival
of commerce as due to their own vaunted policy !
But supposing that Napoleon the Little had had
the first luck of Napoleon the Great, and Britain
had been herself embroiled in war ?
VECTIS.
“ The people are not fickle, but persistent
in their attachments.” — London Spectator.
Dear Bulletin, —You are right about
Westralia being a howling wilderness ; only it is
“more sc.” Yet it has had every chance.
Founded in ’37 under most favourable circum-
stances, its settlers, some 20 years later, petitioned
England for convict labour—and got it. If its
“naturally” watered country were half as good
as (say) the Queensland mulga lands, there would
now be, by natural process of increase, many
millions of sheep on it; there are actually s ume
1 (500,000. The land is so poor that enough wheat
for home consumption can’t be grown on it, and
the settlers have to import even bacon, cheese, i
butter, eggs. &c. The farmers are not lazy, labour
is cheap—l have seen good men working hard-
-408. a month—but the land is just what a Yankee
cynic once described it, “the finest country in
the world to, run through an hour-glass.” A while
back hundreds of visitors arrived monthly, and
their £2O or so apiece boomed the small community
a bit • but no fool is fool enough to stay here if he
can help it. I advise those who mean to give
Westralia a trial to keep enough cash in hand
always to take them out of it when they want to
leave: again, as they are sure to do, or they may
get stranded here for ever.—Yours, Mat. the
Drummer.
The respective values of dailies and
weeklies as advertising mediums is being discussed as a
result of the rapid decline of the weekly of
dailies. Once upon a time, in the halcyon days of Cobb s
coaches, people in the country were content to receive
their news weekly; but the railways and the telegraph
have altered all that. The country resident is no longer
satisfied with a weekly paper containing a great mass of
matter cribbed from some daily journal printed at the
same office. He has mostly read the daily paper and is
as disgusted with having it reserved to him under
another name as a man would be who was offeied hash at
a first-class hotel. If he takes a .weekly paper ■, he wants
to tret one like The Bulletin, origins and readable fiom
cover to cover. There can be no doubt that the doom of
these weekly editions of daily papers is sealed. I cope
don’t give a rap for ponderous co lections of stale
news pitchforked out of the daily editions and jumbled
nn with some “agricultural notes about how to kilt
vermin on cabbages. They have ceased to read these weekly
editions. Only the advertisers, attracted and deluded hj
the enormous circulation usually
faithful. Even they are beginning to find no results,
and are dropping out.

What folly it would be to .cut grass with a pair of scissors! Yet peo-

from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn

But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
age as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap

The “ New Australia” Madness.
A few days hence a couple of hundred
persons will set sail from Port Jackson
in an old timber-boat and brave the
raging main in the endeavour to reach
Paraguay. The departure of the Royal
Tar with the first fatuous batch, their
families and belongings, only waits final
arrangements. On the assumption that life
among wild oranges and yerha mate scrub
has capabilities which it does not offer in
Australia, one of the most feather-headed
expeditions ever conceived since Ponce de
Leon started out to find the Fountain of
Eternal Youth, or Sir Galahad pursued the
Holy Grail, is actually about to set forth.
It is even worse than either of these
escapades, for De Leon could look forward to
a good deal of incidental looting and pillag-
ing, while Galahad was compelled to keep
up appearances somehow. The New Aus-
tralians have no hope before them at best
but to work hard, under great and admitted
disadvantages, for a living which, if they
get it at all, will be rough and meagre for
some years. How far emotion can cloud
reason a thousand fervid and fanatical pro-
jects of this kind have attested in the past.
But this is a crowning instance. A large
number of people, sane so far as theii past
record shows, and capable of exercising their
judgment as adults, have decided to woik
together on a basis of perfect equality. And
they have chosen Paraguay to do it in !
* # *
Or, rather, it should be said they are 1 ‘going
blind,” and Paraguay happens to have been
chosen for them. The scouts of the promoters
of this insane exodus were let loose generally
upon the waste lands and thorny places of
South America. When they were exploring
‘be death-stricken solitudes of the Lower
i-geutine the Rio Negro was proclaimed a
i n ei o Eden by the official organ of the
srrsk, A o?°z ™
J cae Aijdine pampas, or
disputed the possibility of setting up a
paradise of communal industry thereabout
was nob thought to be of much account.
After awhile the prospectors gave that part
of the continent best, thus endorsing the
opinions of those hero who know anything
about it. Then some of the promoters
wanted to know who ever said anything
about going to Rio Negro, or word's to that
effect. In the most disingenuous way they
sought to convey the idea that the formation
of a colony there had never been contem-
plated. in Paraguay the prospectors found
grass, water, trees a thousand miles from the
nearest timber-market, an affable Govern-
ment eager to get them at any price, and
ready to promise anything, and an idle and
nerveless native population. That is really
all that their report discloses. On the
strength of it, of a grant of land, and
certain concessions on paper, the Royal Tar
is to sail with a load of communal enthusiasts
who might as well be bound for the South
Pole, or the off-side of the moon, so far as
many of them are aware. ,
# # »
One need not look beyond the. proposed
basis of settlement and action to see the
hopelessness of the scheme. It involves
equal division of all products. The New
Australian who cannot, or will not, do one-
quarter as much work as his mate will, under
this interpretation of “ mateship,” be en-
titled to draw just as much from the pooled
results. “ A man may produce a loaf of
bread or a painting,” says the chief Sydney
agent of this abnormal fiasco, “ but there
will be no difference in the remuneration for
his labour.” Or, to pub it another way, a
man may do a loaf or work his hardest, and
it will be all the same on pay-day. Such a
system may promote brotherhood, but it
will be of the Cain and Abel quality, not of
the kind the New Australians go so far to
seek. If the strong and capable and willing
among these pioneers wish to contribute to
the support of the others in an idealised
Soup Kitchen they may do so. Thousands
in life as it is here do this continually iu one
way or another—do it kindly and gladly,
according to their ability. But the weak-
lings, the afflicted, whether with natural
disability or dog-laziness, do not swagger
round as their equals. They do not demand
halves of everything as a right and aspire to
the bossing of things. If they did, the milk
of human kindness would quickly dry up in
the rest. The monotony of it all would soon
become tiresome.
# • x #
Under the most favoured conditions, and
with a community of persons absolutely sin-
cere, unselfish, and unambitious, the experi-
ment might be a partial success. It might
succeed as similar organisations, held to-
gether by religious vows, have succeeded in
the past —and that is nob to any great extent.
Such communities had a strong, selfish
incentive to unselfishness, which the New
Australians have not. Just as the Hindoo
devotee propitiates his idols by enduring
infernal tortures ; just as Christian martyrs
faced death for eternal life, they were
dominated by the most intense, and often
the meanest, of selfish human desires—that
of saving their own souls. The New Austra-
lians look chiefly or entirely to the best
means of compassing their material welfare.
Each of them wants to do the best he can for
himself, and professes to think this can be
accomplished by dividing up what he pro-
duces with all the rest. Some do think it,
no doubt. Some don’t think at all, probably,
bub are carried away by their feelings—
“they are dangerous guides, the feelings.”
And a few at least may be credited with
knowing better, and calculating upon per-
sonally keeping on top while the new Utopia
lasts. x
# » •
The individual who wants to keep on top
wo have always with us. The problem of
“ Who's to do the washing-up ?” is one which
nine out of ten human beings will always
seek to solve to his or her own satisfaction
by shunting that unlovely job on someone
else. In New Australia, should other frosty
circumstances not nip the bud of the pro-
ject, this influence will ultimately bring dis-
ruption and chaos. Yery few of the members
will be content to go on according to a
popular vote doing more work than others
for the same pay, or fulfilling tasks which
are specially distasteful. There will be the
inevitable schemings, and heart-burnings,
and bitternesses, the inevitable -struggle for
front seats. To suppose there will not is to
suppose that Lane’s followers, “drawn from
country districts ’ though they may be, are
different from all other people who have
lived. They may think they are for the
time being, as so many under stress of
emotional exaltation have done before, only
to find afterwards the bitterness of their
mistake and reap its disasters. Like the
Kawealians, who were mostly selected men
and women, sincere, intelligent, enthusiastic,
aud who began an enterprise of the same
kind under much fairer conditions, the New
Australians will assuredly quarrel, even to
dissolution over the great questions of dis-
tributing the loaves and fishes, and washing
up.
• # •
In their case, the loaves are more than
doubtful, but the extract we give below
points to the possibility of fish diet as a
dernier ressort. It is taken verbatim from the
Buenos Ayres Standard, the leading daily
paper of South America, of March 12 last -
less than three months ago, and since 'the
New Australia explorers returned :

1 They were promised for the first six months a subsid}
of 50 cents per dav for each adult, and 20 cents for each

•during the whole of that period. Bullocks also were
promised to those having 8 acres of land ready for the
plough: but many of them with 16 acres ready have been
refused them. . , , , . ~
On the occasion of the Minister s last visit to the
colony he, in an eloquent discourse, recommended the
colonists to go on working, and that the Government worn
do all they could for them. Three days afterwards the
subsidy was stopped, which obliged them, so as to avoid
starvation, to sell their standing crops at a low price to
the shopkeepers and other speculators who, under tne
protection of Government, fell upon them like a rapacious
horde. Furthermore, when the Commissary of the co-
lony found that they had applied to the French Govern-
ment for the means of getting out of the hell into which
their credulity had brought them, he ordered a notice to
be put up to the effect that any colonist who should
attempt to leave would be arrested as a common male-
factor. The abuses committed would fill a volume, and it
is only for the public to form an opinion as to what kind
of administration it must be when, after spending 100,000
dollars, the colonists are naked and starving, and are
obliged to seek in fishing and such like for the means
of existence. This is the way the Minister of Colonisation
foments immigration, to the glory and profit of the
country.
# # *
In the faitli that the electric spark of
something or another thrills all their bosoms
and will inspire the strong to go on bearing
the burdens of the weak, and obeying the
orders of the foolish or cunning, the New
Australia scheme has been conceived. In
the more insane faith still that the Para-
guayan Government will stand by pro-
mises which, if they were reliable, and the
place were worth living in at all, would have
caused every acre of the country to be
settled long ago, the expedition is going out.
The end of it, probably, will not be so
disastrous as that of many other South
American dreams. Most of the voyagers,
after a troubled epoch of the swamp fevers,
and yerha mate , should be able to come back
to Old Australia enlightened by a satisfying
experience.
The Imperial Institute Opening.
Several circumstances attendant upon the
dedication of the great new temple of Jingo,
whose uprearing has been inspired and directed
by primrose-eating-Tories, idolatrous slaverers
of Royalty, masters and servants of Caste, and
all manhoodless jackalls, courtiers, and tuft-
hunters of Imperialism, were remarkable. For
the matter of that, the whole of the official
proceedings were remarkable, not so much in
the sense of a national event, as in that of a
national exposure. The classes who wish to
maintain the integrity of the Empire as a
whole, and clasp its growing and restive out-
posts in the bonds of a brotherhood for war and
taxation in their behalf, felt it needful to make
a supreme and garish effort. So the courts, in
which tributes ol loyalism from snobbish misre-
presentatives of British colonies and possessions
were heaped, had to be opened with what a
civilised press calls “impressive ceremonies.”
The Colonists and the Possessed had to be won
over finally, and every sentiment of independ-
ence and republicanism subjugated in their
bosoms by an unparalleled display of the King-
dom and the Power and the Glory.
* * #
Possibly it might all have seemed impressive
to “the poor Indian, whose untutored mind
clothes him in front and leaves him bare
behind.” The Kanaka, who forfeits his placid
island life (when he doesn’t happen to be kid-
napped) to sweat at “trashing” sugarcane
under the North Queensland sun for love of the
red bandana of Manchester and the twelve-
bladed pocket-knife of Birmingham, might
have been visibly affected by the griev-
ous and blatant paganisms of the occa-
sion. The proceedings seem to have par-
taken of the characteristics of a Lord Mayor’s
show and a Somali love-feast. They revealed
the abiding British faith in barbaric ostenta-
tion, and the aldermanic craving for shine of
pinch beck and sound of brass trumpets. A blaring
proclamation of the doctrine of British Respec-
tability, a national outburst of Cheap Jackery,
meant to allure fools from the Colonies and the
Possessions into selling their substantialities
for meretricious gewgaws and tinselled baubles,
that is what the opening of the Imperial
Institute amounted to. A tawdry, barbaric
bazaar, where cheap, wholesale buyers sought to
meet cheap sellers, and the commodities dealt
in were the earnings, the liberties, and the
lives of peoples of the present and future.
* * *
The whole strength of the company, so to
speak, gathered in the usual Richardsonian
fashion on the platform outside of the tent, in
full stage costume. The street procession was
a glittering, interminable string of Royalties,
sub-Royalties, andpicturesquely-tailored nobili-
ties, bandits and spongers on the public, such as
has seldom been seen even in England. Belted
Earls by the score, whose forbears haven’t done
a useful tap of w»ork for generations, and who
wouldn’t think of associating, as a general
thing, with anybody who had. Dukes who
have each, in each year of their lives, consumed
the earnings of hundreds of miserable families
at home, and who want to go on doing it
abroad, backed up by the power of an in-
divided Army and Navy, obedient to the rule
Things As They Are and Ever Shall Be, World
without End, if the Empire can only be ken't
together and run upon its present lines.

Apothecary L. L. Smith, made opulent and great
by the pound-notes of young men who didn’t
feel well, “ crooked the pregnant hinges of U le

logues of Victorian offerings at the shrine o|
Grovel. Infinite littleness seizing a large hoard
ing to advertise itself upon ; oppressive privilege
with the death-rattle in its throat, strutting
abroad in brave masquerade, and trusting t„
the,, old stage-gags, with the doom of Time and
Knowledge written on its forehead ! The unity
of the Empire, the greatness of the undivided
British people, and the necessity of cohesion in
the interests of them all and of freedom— that
was the patter.
* * •
Eew Australians would have been taken in
by it, anyhow. But, if some were likely to
believe that this flaring Imperialistic corrob-
boree was prompted by true patriotic desire
for the general well-being of British descendants
everywhere, one circumstance which occurred
should save them from making a bad mistake,
At the reception given by the Prince of Wales,
after the opening rites, the assemblage cheered
Lord Salisbury and hooted Mr. Gladstone.
That simple fact gives the whole business away,
The New York Times truthfully described it
as “ a display of highly-developed snobbery and
a survival of savagery impossible in America,”
* # «
It’s more than that. Only deep-seated
original blackguardism could thus heap insult
on "the grey head of a man who, at the edge of
the grave, is engaged in the greatest political
battle that has been fought in England during
this century. From the participants in anil
figure-heads of such vulgar and meaningless
ceremonies, not much in the way of sentimental
decency could be looked for. Conduct, that in
the United States, under Popular Government,
would be regarded as evidence of insanity, may
be allowed to pass among the titled descendants
of marauders and murderers. The gross act
itself need not surprise us, but the plain
motive of it should enlighten such Australians
as need enlightenment.
* # #
Mr. Gladstone stands for the extension of
popular liberties. He is the leader of that
major section of the British people which thinks
that the power of government should he vested
in those who arg governed, as a whole, instead
of being entrusted to a powerful privileged
minority. The political purpose which inspires
him is that of securing for the people of Ireland
the form of Parliamentary representation
which a great majority of them has desired for
years past. He does not ask that more should
be given them than has been given to every
one of the Australian provinces. The justice of
the claim made has gradually impressed the
people, not only of Great Britain, but of the
civilised world. The insistence by the
Tory lords and Imperialistic masters that
a so - called Union, brought about by
treachery and held together with blood, shall
stand as it now stands, lias become a burning
disgrace to the Imperial Parliament. The rela-
tion of Ireland to the Imperial Government has, .
ever since the Union, been that of a vassal Stale.
Its soil is chiefly owned by titled and other
Conservative personages who live abroad in
safety upon the substance of which they rob
the people under sanction of British laws ami
under protection of British military forces.
r # # *
It is because Mr. Gladstone heads the army
of peace and true union, which constitutionally
seeks to give the Irish people a right to manage
their own public affairs, that he was hootee.
For this, the Indian princes, gouty landlords,
aldermanic parasites, and C.M.G.’s opene
their mouths to hiss at him. And because
Lord Salisbury tries to block the path of Home
Rule, and to drag Ireland for ever behind i
Imperial chariot-wheels, he was applaudei J
the same crowd.
# * *
It is not the fact that Ireland has been scan-
dalously misgoverned, and her people mai
miserable and rebellious, that has enlis ec
her side the sympathy of the masses,
the conviction, everywhere growing, ■
people can govern themselves muci
satisfactorily than other people cau £°. ■

a cco„ut. nt , ta. .worn in
' IL , n f the forthcoming application for a
“True bill ” that the possibility of a true bill
not being found would seem, under normal con-
j?* a unworthy of discussion. The last
f Tee sheet of the Mercantile Bank did on
fhe expert declaration of Mr. Simpson, under-
rate the necessary provision for bad and
V Tf. debts ”by £BOO,OOO, of which amount
Tt least £600,000 consisted of advances to, or
n the shares of, limited liability companies
ri ch complntei the said Matthew Henry
Datles was, in every case, one of the promoters
and of which companies he was, in the majority of
cases the chairman of directors, and in which
said companies he had, in every case, a pre-
ponderating influence.” Furthermore, Simpson
swears that a number of these companies, im
ferentially assumed to be good, going
concerns, were either in liquidation, or were
endeavouring to effect compromises with their
creditors, prior to the issue of the last Mer-
cantile Bank balance-sheet. Again, Simpson
attached to his information a memo, alleging
that, at the previous half-yearly balancing, the
“cash at bankers’” had been swelled by the
inclusion of bogus cheques to the amount of
£66 400, these paper-moneys being paid into
the Mercantile on August 1, ’9l, by persons or
companies directly connected with Davies, and
withdrawn by other cheques two or three days
later. It is only the alleged facts advanced
bv Simpson and others that the grand jury
will be called upon to consider. No opinion
as to the guilt or innocence of Chairman
Davies and Manager Millidge is expected from
the grand jury. It has merely to say whether
the allegations constitute a prima facie case
against the accused persons, or otherwise.
Meanwhile, Victoria in general, and Melbourne
most particularly, is full of misgivings as to the
settlement of even this simple point. The
special jurors’ list contains the names of scores
of influential bank-overdrafters and active
enemies to “disclosures,” who are doing all
that lies in their very considerable power to
stop the Mercantile case from coming to an
issue. Of its history thus far, an ex-Minister
of the Crown (Peacock, M.L.A.) says : “ I am
astounded at the underhand influences which
have been at work. I am grieved to find pro-
minent men in the community log-rolling in
the basest fashion. The best interests of the
country have been subordinated to suit the
tactics of a small handful of men. I say these
things deliberately, because 1 am possessed of
information which should impel any person of
common honesty to speak out. ... lam
positively staggered at the revelations made to
me by responsible people.” Evidently, then, this
is no time for believing that a Melbourne grand
jury doesn’t require to be carefully scrutinised
by the community whose Law is said to be
dominated by a handful of corruptionists. It
has not escaped notice that the counsel who
obtained an order for a grand jury from the
Pull Court threw out the suggestion that 23
jurors should be secured. 23 is the full number
allowed, but it would seem that there is no
legal guarantee that the attendance of empan-
nelled persons shall go higher than 12. Not
less than 12 jurors can agree to find a true bill,
therefore, one “ cronk ” Melbournian amongst
the minimum grand jury would bring about a
miscarriage of justice which 11 “ cronk ” ditto
could not accomplish on a tribunal of the maxi-
mum strength. Presuming that a grand jury
over-rules the decision of the Attorney-General
and finds a true bill against Davies and
iiLLiDGE, and presuming that the same
Attorney-General directs the Crown Law
epartment to resume the prosecution which,
o le general dissatisfaction of Australia, was
eoently dropped, a sceptical country will pos-
y demand a reconstruction of the Crown’s
gal policy. “Up to now,” says Peacock,
C" 4 ;’ “every point and every feature has
strained in favour of the defendants.”

has lent him money, whose bond slave he is,
enjoying no comforts, ever struggling to be
free, but compelled to resign the land at the
end of 28 years, if not before, to the
men who has sucked all the profits from
it. Or he may be a willing dummy
and make a business of it. To achieve
its presumable object, the bill ought to make
provisions for putting the utterly moneyless on
the land and maintaining them until self-
supporting. But alienation should be no part
of the scheme and transfers should be charily
granted. It was enough that Copeland should
have penned “ Adam’s Curse ” ; no one desires
that he should follow it up with a bill, pre-
sumably for the relief of poverty, but in
reality for the aggregation of wealth, which
might in time be named “ Copeland’s Cala-
mity.”
At the humiliation and prayer demonstration in
Melbourne Town Hall, after Bishop Goe had
delivered an address, the congregation sang,
“ God moves in a mysterious way.” This shows
that even now the church hasn’t begun to grasp
the situation. It was the fact that Matthew
Davies and Bent and Munro moved in such a
mysterious way that was the main cause of the
trouble. The insinuation that the Deity went
out of its way to move in a more mysterious
fashion than usual for the express purpose of
making suburban allotments go down to their
natural value, is only another example of the
diseased self-importance of the average cleric,
who, if he chances to stub his toe against a log
with a nail in it, or if he over-eats himself and
gets a pain in the dinner-tank, always says that
he is being “ chastened ”by Heaven. Also, in
a certain infiatedly bumble fashion, he is proud
of being “chastened,” just as the ordinary
carnal groveller is proud of having been kicked
by a prince. If anybody could convince the
church that it wasn’t being specially chastened
it would be the roughest thing that has hap-
pened to it since the Reformation.
Dear Bulletin, —Are you not rather rough on
the “cockatoo”? Here in S.A. his principal
reason for being Conservative is that he owns
his freehold—or has a right of purchase—and
so listens to the National Ass re confiscation,
&c. Where they are leaseholders —and over
3,300,000 acres are let on perpetual lease to
farmers —they, for the most part, support the
Labour-party in the proposal for an increase of
land-tax and a decrease in Customs duties. It
is true the average “ cockie ” wants everybody
to be made to work 16 hours a day and that he
is deplorably mean, but his own wretched life
is the cause of it. And his life is more wretched
than ever now with wheat at half a-crown a
bushel, and horse-flesh so cheap that it doesn’t
pay to breed it. Look at his own wizened
face, his dried-up, careworn wife, his hulking
sons and clumsy daughters. Not one of them
has any joy in life ; the highest ideal of the
women is the Methodist chapel, of the men the
Saturday night in the pub. And those who
know the Australian farmer know that neither
talking or writing will make him any* better.
Nothing but example can do it, and unless the
State sets the example I don’t know who will.
Apart from low prices, most of the misery of
agricultural life is due to the solitary farm
system. If we had farm villages there
would be society and companionship, and
it is society that has made civilisation.
There would be a library, a public garden,
and an assembly-room for meetings and
dances. If the Anglo-Saxon could so far forget
himself as to “ bunch ” the cooking for a dozen
families the impossible would have been achieved
and the slavery of the farmer’s wife and
daughters would end. They would have time
to read, to cultivate flowers, and to visit. The
sons would no longer be louts thirsting to get
to the city, the daughters no longer gawky
gigglers. This change is possible right off, if
anything short of dynamite could move the
bucolic and make him gregarious, as he is in
other countries. Under the altered circum-
stances it might even be found possible to give
the farm hand something better than the reap-
ing machine to camp in during winter.— An
Ex-Cockie.

Don W. Lane, the boss argonaut of Paraguay,
writes mystical letters to the daily press at
intervals about the glories of “ New Australia,”
and his outpourings are reminiscent partly of
the Mahdi prophesying in the desert with foam
dropping on his beard, and partly of Mrs.
Hominy, the bony apostle of the unutterable
and the yellow, skinny dreamer about the
development of matter. Every now and then
some cold, realistic doubter expresses a sus-
picion that Paraguay, after all, may be very
little better than our Northern Territory, and
suggests that the Government is unstable, and
markets are remote, and titles shaky, and
things generally unpromising. Then the founder
and principal dreamer of the expedition rises up
and replies with a hunk of eloquence about the
destiny of man, and the hidden forces that are
driving him onward, so that he is mysteriously
shoved behind by the great inevitable, whereby
he must ultimately concuss against the unseen,
and become absorbed in space. For example :
Life must go on. We cannot stop it if we would ; we
cannot oppose to the supreme law that inspires it our
puny preventitives or our timid fears. Behind life is a
force that laughs at death, that mocks at disease, that
ignores pain. "Whence” and “whither” we may dis-
pute over, but on the solemn fact of living there is no
dispute, not even in the metaphysical thought which sees
in existence but the dreaming of a dream. And whether
we come again into life, or whether it is only the little
ones who come and go like bubbles on a brook, life is and
is always-and we have part in its making. It is the
future life that judges the past life, inexorably, inevit-
ably. And when our present is past, what shall we say
if we have sown evil and given no thought to the good—
if we have gone out into the darkness with our selfishness
encrusting us as a shroud, and our souls scorched with the
burning frost of indifference and inhumanity ?
The above is a comforting thing to the man who
has risked his all in the Paraguayan madness.
The Bulletin can see a vision of the New
Australian settlement as it will be some day in
the future. There will be a few hundred
people digging and fencing in a dreary, hopeless
fashion out in the great loneliness, and living
on woe and unsaleable vegetables and dreams
of home. And, meanwhile, the founded of the
settlement will be foaming at the mouth and
uttering poetry beneath a tree, and wildly ask-
ing the damp ferns, “ What is life ? ” There is
altogether too much poetry and too little re-
liable market for potatoes about “ New Aus-
tralia.”

Mr. John Howell, manager of the Proprietary
mine, and mining-companies’ representative on
the New South Wales Lead-poisoning Commis-
sion, declined to sign the report of that extra-
parliamentary body. Which is, perhaps, the
best guarantee that could be given that the
report is worth its cost. Summarised, the
report finds that lead-poisoning is not an un-
avoidable accompaniment of the Broken Hill
situation, but is more or less preventible, and
certain recommendations are made in respect
of precautionary safeguards. As far as the
Dices Government is concerned, the obtaining
of this report has probably fulfilled the whole
idea of its duty. It can point to the Commis-
sion and to its little bill, and it can shelve all
further action pending reconsideration. As the
mine-owners’ man wouldn’t sign the report,
and there being no compulsory law respecting
its recommendations, the mine-owners may be
relied upon to do no better straight away. The
New South Wales Labour members might for
once make a united move on behalf of their
working mates.
♦
One of the chief features of the Queensland
elections was the defeat of Isidor Lissner,
Minister for Mines, by the Ravenswood miners.
All that money and influence could do to secure
his return was done in the most shameless
manner—storekeepers stopping miners’ credit,
and even threatening to take back explosives in
use on some of the mines. Vehicles and beers
were plentiful on the Lissner side, while Jack-
son, the Labour candidate, had neither. The
contest was complicated by the presence of a
third candidate, a local solicitor, who bid for
the labour-vote; yet so thoroughly did the
miners stick together that the solicitor did not
get as many votes as there were members on
his committee. The little Minister, at his last
meeting on the eve of the polling, did not
invite questions, but an elector obtained leave
to put two. These were asked and answered
as follows :
“Is it not a fact that, under the Land-grant Railway Act,
a miner cannot begin to win gold or silver until he has
sunk 70 feet below the surface, and then has to pay for
surface damages tor shafts or approaches?” The Minister
replied: “That is so." “That being so,” said the ques-
tioner, “is it not consummate boldness—not to say
audacity—on your part, as Minister for Mines, the
Minister who is supposed to safeguard the interests of the
mining community all over the province, to come to a
mining constituency and ask the miners to return you in
order to assist to carry out this nefarious job ? ”
The Minister did not reply, and the audience
shrieked with derisive laughter.
They’ll Do!
Those who had the privilege of breakfasting with the
Governor and lady were very much impressed with the
affable and easy manner of both. Lady Duff was de-
scribed by one gentleman as “an improved edition of
Lady Carington,” whose gentleness and vivacity Sydney
people so well remember. Sir Robert created a very good
impression by his genial, manly demeanor; and the
opinion has already been expressed that the new Governor
and his wife will soon become warm favourites among the
Australians.— Evening News.
We feared the very worst —we thought
They really mightn’t have been able
To act as decent Christians ought
When seated at a breakfast table ;
Thank God ! our doubts are set at rest
The Bulletin once more breathes freely—
Thank God, they’ve passed the crucial test,
And acted, on the whole, genteely !
Our new-arrived vice-regal pair
Will do this “colony ” much credit;
Those who were privileged to share
Their morning meat have boldly said it.
Watched closely by the anxious eyes
Of “ gentlemen ” who mark such matters,
They lapsed into no gaucheries,
Nor swallowed knives, nor licked their platters !
They didn’t eat like people who
Are Uas6 and of grub disdainful.
Nor rush the business and chew
The steaks and chops with noises painful;
They didn’t sneeze, or snort, or cough,
Or make the cloth all round them greasy ;
We’re glad to know their manner of
Negotiating food was “ easy.”
The Governor was self-possessed
And firm ; his mode of mastication
Showed hidden force which may attest
Itself upon some great occasion;
His elbows overset no cup,
No wayward crumb stuck in his-neck fast
And neither would go down or up—
A calm dictator to his breakfast.
He wore an etiquette-book smile
That Darling Point could not find fault with.
And showed no wild confusion while
He took his egg a pinch of salt with ;
He talked in unembarrassed way,
Of topics of the Sunny South full;
Said just the thing he tried to say,
And never said it with his mouth full.
We feared Sir Robert might have “ stacked ”
His plate and, like a wolf or vulture,
All victuals within reach attacked,
But Appetite allied with Culture
Distinguished our distinguished guest,
Whose style was happy, free, and genial,
Who no cold, surly thoughts expressed,
Nor cursed at the attendant menial!
His wife—we mean his Lady—too,
Was to close scrutiny subjected,
Which she appears to have come through
With credit great and unexpected.
“ Dear Lady Carington ” was “ sweet,”
So they declared who could effuse so;
Now she must go to a back seat—
A “gentleman ” has told the News so !
She was “ vivacious ” in her day
Of social headship and position,
And now—well, she has gone away
And we have “ an improved edition ” 1
They’ll do, in short. The Governor
A gentleman is, bona-fide
(A thing we have some openings for),
His wife, they say’s, a puffick lydy !
Someone threw a brick the other day at
the train in which Gladstone was travelling, and
broke a window alongside him. The cable re-
marks ; “ It is believed that the stone was thrown
by some person politically opposed to Mr. Glad-
stone, with the object of personally injuring him.”
This looks probable. Still it is just possible that
the boulder was thrown to amuse Gladstone.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
7th June, 1893.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Lady Duff begins very cannily. She says she
cannot remember names, but she “never forgets a
face.” The old, old trick of the suave society
person who doesn’t know who on earth these
people are, but receives them all the same with a
warmth of manner which seems to imply that Miss
Dash’s freckles are seared into her very soul,
although Miss Dash’s name quite escapes her for
the moment. Lady Duff has come to a bonny
place for exercising her non-face-forgetting faculty;
but I rather think she will lose confidence in her-
self after her first general reception—or, I mean, I
hope she will. Any leading lady at Government
House who couldn’t forget at least some of the
visages I have seen steering a changeless course
for the sandwiches on mob-days ought to have
prayers offered up for her in all the churches.
I hear that Gov. Duff’s first levee at Govern-
ment House the other Monday did not pass off
without one or two hitches—incidental to all first
performances, by the way. One thing was that a
number of dignitaries, who ought to have been
posed in the red drawing-room by virtue of
private entree, were whirled about in the crowd
of ordinary folks in the vestibule. I don’t know,
though, how anybody could have mistaken the
aide-de-camp for the Governor, but it seems some
really did. Men would plunge into the room and
grasp the a.d.c. blindly by the hand and pursue
their mad career, only to be directed back to the
Governor, whose bright smile—so fatally near a
laugh when this sort of thing was happening—is
probably haunting some of them still.
Mr. Galton, private sec. to Sir Robert Duff,
wears a tiny stripe of tartan on the near
side of his coat on occasions of state. It isn’t
effective —it only gives the Kyrle-Bellewish secre-
tary the appearance of the youth who knots blue
ribbon about his person to reassure an anxious
world that he never goes beyond ginger-pop. And,
apropos of the Gov.’s suite, I hear on lovely
authority that what both of them remarked about
Australian belledom was its “ stern and steadfast
withering glare fixed on our faltering features
there.” Verb, sap! But I have over and over
again noticed that even the most ordinarily dis-
creet maiden will coolly inspect a new man who
happens either to be a spectacle or closely con-
nected with one, as if he was nothing more
emotional than a tailor’s-dummy.
Sydney Tattersall’s Club held a rather melan-
choly race-meeting last Saturday, but still it may
live in history as being Governor Duff’s very first
appearance at Randwick. His Ex. turned up in a
sporting-looking fawn covert coat and a dark
necktie—to the manifest despair of those youths
who had almost strangled themselves with shriek-
ing plaid scarfs in the hope that the new person-
age would sport the family token on his haber-
dashery. And just here it occurs to me that I
don’t believe the Governor has a tartan. lam
told that it is only the head of a clan who is per-
mitted to dress his followers in chromatic spasms,
and I think that, after all the mental strain, it may
be discovered by some rigid authority that there is
no Duff clan, and that our Duff is only a
Saxon and merely privileged to dress himself
with shepherd’s plaid. By the way, I think
Governor D. ought always to give, not take the
odds on a racecourse, don’t you ? The luck of
“ laying on ” may run in the family.
The Austrian Archduke Ferdinand and his
cousin tried to shear a sheep with the Wolseley
machine in Sydney the other day. The Arch-
duke’s attempt was rather hopeful, but his cousin,
who wore a pair of large gold bangles, was not so
successful. His bangles tripped him up at critical
moments, although he shook them back with the
impatient grace of a young lady whose bracelets
come over her fingers when she’s pawing the
piano. Somebody ought to have explained that
the Australian shearer scarcely ever wears bangles
when at work.
Mrs. Mayoress Manning’s second reception (on
last Monday), in her rooms at Sydney Town Hall,
was a pleasant afternoon function. Mrs. Manning
wore a good-looking dress of steel-grey satin
brocade, elaborately trimmed with black velvet
and jet—small bonnet, en suite. Some unwise
admirer had given her a dozen or so buttonholers
of violets to hold. They “ went ” with the dress
very well, but as they weren’t tied together they
seemed rather a slippery handful for the popular
hostess. Miss Manning, who made a übiquitous
sub-hostess, wore a severely cut gown of dark-
blue, topped by a black hat and feathers —but the
afternoon was so cloudy you wanted a bull’s-eye
lantern indoors to see just what the crowd was
wearing. When the electric-light was turned on,
things became much better—especially for the
woman with glittering jet concealed about her
person, who began to twinkle, twinkle, like a
little star. There was a very smart crowd—but
before I stop I must congratulate Mrs. Manning
on introducing an afternoon-tea-cup that you can
get your nose into. It’s quite time the up-ended
thimble of the festive tea-tray were passed on, more
in sorrow than in anger, to the nursery doll’s-
house.

i u iiatic stage-management,
and the concluding military pageant was received
on the first night with cries of “Bravo, Jo!”
even from the dress-circle. Under these over-
powering scenic circumstances, I only remember
that Miss Williamson looked her best in an
Empire tea-gown of corn-coloured silk, made with
big sleeves and Bernhardtishly trimmed with
brown feather fur, and that a friendly Arab who
seemed to be very excited was got up to look like
a Greenaway infant in the fourth act.
In “ The Idler,” at Sydney Criterion, it strikes
me as being unwise for Lady Harding (Mrs.
Brough) to wear such a very becoming wrap of
black velvet, trimmed with mongolian fur, and
flapping back to show pink linings; also, to be
so careful about her hair when she goes to argue
with her bold, bad lover. I can’t help thinking
that if she had diplomatically turned-up with her
hair in curl-papers, an old flannelette wrapper
with a button or two at large, carpet slippers
worn-out, and a faint suggestion of fried fish,
the naughty man would have let her go at sight,
and ventilated his room afterwards. In the banquet
scene, Mrs. Brough wore a well-fitting cream-
satin, aggravated by diamonds. Miss Temple’s
best dress was a cinnamon-brown, made with a bell
skirt and full sleeves, the sleeveless bodice of black
silk fitting her like a glove. I thought Mr. Bouci-
cault as Simeon Strong looked very like Bellew’s
Scarpia when he sat writing at the table ; and, by-
the-way, is it the author’s fault that Titheradge
upsets the doddering grammar of the d.c. by
ejaculating—“Me who deserve it so little ”?
Tempo Refuge Ball, which has engulphed th e
Fresh Air League Ball as a whale swallows a
tittlebat, is to come off at Sydney Town Hall to-
night (Thursday). Sir Robert and Lady Duff are
to be present, and no two ladies will be allowed to
dance together.
I saw a really uncommon frock in “front” on
the first night of “Human Nature.” Imagine
black tulle thickly embroidered in heavy gold
spiders, the low bodice of black tulle and gold
filagree cut in wings on the shoulders —but the
best of it was you couldn’t see that it was cut at
all—it seemed to happen like the sheath of a lily.
If anybody had worn it on the stage what a dive
there would have been for opera glasses ! And I
thought that the worst thing about her dress
was that it reminded you of the sort of paralyser
a society actress plays “ Camille ” in.
On dit that the most astonishing thing about the
recent marriages (down South) of a couple of
fashionable barmaids was that the doctor married
the lady whose billowy figure was mostly gutta-
percha ! Medical science (surgeons are all very
well at a post-mortem) has still a lot to learn
evidently.
The N.S.W. Silkgrowers Association (still in
the chrysalis) is quite the latest fad emanating
from the Ladies’ Literary Club. It is responsible
for much enthusiasm, as if the world were only
waiting for a cream-coloured moth to lay eggs on
a mulberry-leaf and settle the question, “ What
shall we do with our girls?” But, whether the
fascinations of the silk-worm are strong enough to
lure femininity away from shop-windows to pick
leaves off mulberry-bushes and watch the inter-
esting grub how he gorges, will only be learnt by
experience (shares one-pound each).
The splendour of the plush-clad cook at 255.
weekly seems temporarily diminished in Sydney,
and the old percentage of one Mary Ann to’six
missuses must be read the other way up. A
Sydney lady who recently went in search of a
housemaid, found that the crowd of applicants
extended into the street —and another woman who
wanted a “general,” arrived on the whole registry
office in tears ! Odd to think that the moment is
at hand when an Australian house-mother can
actually strike an assured attitude and dictate :
“Bridget, I allow no followers, and your holiday
is the afternoon of the fourth Sunday in the
month-only.” A great sign of the subdued state
of the labour-market is that man has taken to
wearing shirts again—at least, the pleading “no
shirts ” advertisements dwindle visibly every day.
What a side-light it is on feminine inquisitive-
ness that the drapers who run bargain sales in-
variably whitewash their windows and confidently
await the excited mob ? When a woman can
flatten her little nose against the panes and drink
her fill of bargains from the neutral ground of the
public pavement she hasn’t the same incentive to
rush in and rescue the enterprising tradesman
from the jaws of the silk moth as she has when a
sheet of pipe-clay intervenes between her and the
“ sacrifices ” which then become golden mysteries
to her piqued curiosity. lam certain that if
married men only knew how much a white-washed
window costs them there would be a deputation of
aggrieved husbands to the Mayor in less than no
time. And in this connection it occurs to me that
a city must be very insolvent indeed when even
the shop-windows want whitewashing.
The clerks in several Sydney banks have had
their lunch-time altered to a later hour than usual
because the “directors wish to prevent their
officers loitering round the street-preachers !” The
banks have evidently had quite enough Sunday-
school superintendent, thank you ; but this altera-
tion (the young man with the tartan tie and tan
boots calls it “arbitrary”) will make a regular
revolution in Block time. Young ladies who
intercept the hungry bank-clerk on his way to his
noontide bun will please accept this intimation.
I think that “Faustine,” in Sydney Daily
Telegraph, puts her objection to flowers at
funerals on an erroneous basis. It is surely not
the “ waste ” involved in the tribute that consti-
tutes the ground of indictment; you might as well
talk of the waste of shoe-leather in visiting the
grave, or the waste of zinc-lining in a crematorial
urn. The objection to flowers as at present
utilised in funeral purposes is that they so often
are an advt of a bathetic posturer in the first
place, and of a sharp florist in the second, while
not rarely they are the mere try-on of a tricky
tradesman who intends to force the bill on to the
victim “when the funeral’s done.” “ A flower,”
as Heine says, “friend, if you love me, spare me
a flower.” Heine would not call the flower given
by a friend “a waste;” but the flowers the
dead get in these days are mostly given by cheap-
johns and mountebanks.
I am told that at a very swagger dinner at
Toorak, a well-known society girl wore her long
gloves all through the meal. “Why do you wear
your gloves ?” asked the Johnnie who sat by her.
“Because my arms are so thin,” was the reply,
“ but mamma says I’m very well made everywhere
else.”
Yours faithfully.

Haddon Chambers’ drama, “The Idler,
was presented on Saturday at the Criterion, this
bein''- its second appearance in Sydney. Un tne
other occasion, it eventuated under various adverse
conditions at the Garrick, but in the present
instance it gets as good an opportunity as the
hungriest drama need ask for, and the result is
mostly satisfactory. The only possible objection
that can be taken to it is that the central incident
seems to have been kept rather long, and
possibly a little high in consequence. It isn t
altogether a new-laid incident —in fact, it seems to
be partly hatched. But “ The Idler is
full of strong situations, and is a play ot
infinite possibilities. There is no oppressive
villain in it, and no hero whose conspicuous good-
ness weighs like a Himalaya on the soul.
There isn’t too much of it; the writer
knew where to stop, and he doesn’t wait
to tell whether the two marriages come off or
not, or whether the other man ever gets back
from the North Pole or is lost among the frozen
seas and bears. The language put in Titheradge s
mouth is the perfection of gentlemanly seduction ;
and when the lady calls on him secretly and at
night, apparently for the express purpose of being
lost, the situation is so well managed that no one
seems to realise how many serious possibilities
there are in it, although it almost seems as if she
was going to be lost in full view of the audience.
It is the old patriarchal story of the Fall over
again, only the parties fall politely in evening
dress, or rather one of them tries hard to
fall but the other won’t. In the old days
of Genesis, man fell in an uncouth fashion
in abbreviated bathing-nostume, but times have
changed since then. “The Idler” is a genuine
triumph for Mrs. Brough, who plays a difficult
part with pathos and dignity ; and for Boucicault,
whose American millionaire is all that a million-
aire ought to be. This latter remark is based on
the writer’s acquaintance with one millionaire,
who was distinctly everything that such a person
ought not to be—in fact, he was everything that
everybody ought not to be except a hangman or a
gorilla. Titheradge, as the Idler, is an attenuated
success, and it is noticeable that certain objec-
tionable mannerisms are rapidly growing on
Titheradge. Theworstis a curious habit of shutting
his eyes most of the time, which is suggestive of a
blind man what has happened to his
dog, and the next worst is a custom of chewing
the air as if he were dining on space. Misses
Homer and Temple, Mr. Brough, as an ancient
gentleman in goggles who asks Titheradge for his
mother’s hand, and Cecil Ward, are all satis-
factory. So, also, is Miss Nelly Mortyne, a lady
whom the audience would gladly see oftener, and
who has a great deal to recommend her as a
gushing widow in a frock that is cut low at the
front. Wherever there is an opening for a gush-
ing widow with a frock cut low at the front, The
Bulletin cordially recommends this lady for the
billet.
** * *
A company, actuated doubtless by urgent
private reasons, broke out on Saturday at the
Sydney Opera House with “ A Foundered For-
tune.’’ There is an element of absolute originality
about this drama, a wild unexpectedness, a re-
gardlessness of time and space, and a tendency to
be reckless about chronology, which are very re-
markable. It begins with the return of an old
gentleman suspected of murder, who has been
hiding for 15 years, and his nephew, who is
alleged to be a “pirate,” lays poison for him,
only his principal enemy drinks it instead, and
when he dies a strange woman rushes in, and for
no visible reason denounces the old man’s son-in-
law. The son-in-law is sentenced to death, and
the nephew proves to be someone else, and
the proofs of all this are understood to be
hidden in an iron safe which can’t be opened
because a boy has vainly offered the keys to
everybody and no one will take them. Then the
escaped son-in-law and the safe and the whole
company go to sea in a coffin-ship, and the son is
stunned and put in the safe, and it sinks to the
bottom of the deep. The interest centres princi-
pally in that safe. Wlien it is recovered by divers
weeks later, and brought back to the office, Frank
Cates hangs about it with a pickaxe but fears to
open it because his squashed and putrefied victim
will roll out as an accusing mass of old green
decay. But when he does open it the old gentle-
man trots out instead, and the drowned victim
steps in through the doorway and accuses Cates, in
voice, of many crimes. Whereupon
the latter gentleman blows himself up by firing
the gas-meter. _ In a previous conflict Cates is
shot five times in the feet but escapes uninjured
Also an ardent lover allows his girl to be
locked up in the cellar with Cates, and hears that
gentleman attacking her with the pickaxe without
remonstrance, A small newsboy proves to be a
baronet because he is the son of a lord, which is
about as clear as if his uncle had fallen overboard
and consequently his grandfather was a sledge-
hammer. I owards the end a horrible suspicion
arises that Mr. Cates is the safe, but is trving to
disguise himself as the pickaxe, and that'the gas
explosion is the Dora Dora blacks. A certain
amount of decent acting is wasted on this per-
formance. Misses Fannie Thynne and Ada
.Lawrence are two attractive ladies. Mr. J. P.
West is a pleasant Hebrew with a rich oid nose
and a voice which is awash with unctuousness and
port wine; and Mr. Cates presents certain good
points. 8

y ears of thereabouts since
Human Nature ’ was last seen in Sydney, and
it is still the same big, brassy drama as of old.
1 hemostconspicuous idea of the authors, evidently
is that, when a man finds his wife struggling to
escape from a person who holds her by the curls
or otherwise, hxs natural and reasonable course,
instead of jumping on the assailant, is to cast the
lady orr and go away to hide his misery in the
ooudan. And his next fixed conviction seems to
be that when a lawyer wants to track a brutally
ill-used victim, he quite naturally runs her down
with dogs, or any other means, in open daylight, or
at any other time, and that he has full power to
arrest her by the back button of tier frock wherever
he finds her. Also, there is a general impression
that when anybody dies the money naturally goes
to the nearest scoundrel, and that when a family
solicitor is authorised to take divorce proceedings
against a lady, his first act, as a matter i
course, is to tear her infant from her by ha a
and carry it away. In fact, “Human Nature'l
is built on two principal assumptions; first th f
a lawyer is practically omnipotent; and seeonH
that, in free and happy England, ladies of hilt
descent are habitually dragged around by th
scalp, and chased through bogs, briars, and dart
forests, and chivvied at night over railway areh '
by their legal representatives. It is an 'awfll
commentary on British institutions— the
of that pale, bedraggled lady, with her stocking
torn and muddy, and her dress rent asunder hat
less, hungry, and seared, racing till she drum
through swamps and hedges with her child under
her arm, and the solicitor in full cry behind her
This discrepancy about the solicitor is the chief
objection to “Human Nature,” which, apart from
its legal aberrations, is an interesting composition
Bland Holt makes a comic law clerk such as m
attorney every had in his office before or since and
W, E. Baker, Sass, Corlesse, and one or two more
are not so overwhelmed by the scenery as to alto
gether lose their individuality. Also, Mrs. Bland
Holt impersonates a particularly loveable little
nurse, and the rest of the co. maintains a reason-
able level of respectability.

The Tivoli, under Harry Rickards’ manage-

of Sydney. A new London craze, “Daddy
wouldn’t buy me a Bow-wow,” is promised for
Saturday.

“It’s Never Too Late to Mend" con-
tinues a profitable career at Sydney Majesty’s
and George Rignold promises to inaugurate a
series of “ souvenir nights,” which, he says will
come off “ without loss of dignity or prestige to
this popular theatre.” It all depends, in The
Bulletin’s opinion, on what the souvenirs coni
sist of. The present writer distinctly remembers
seeing an aggravated bushman kicking Ms
souvenir to flinders (it was a double perambulator)
in the stalls of a Brisbane theatre, and when ho
had dashed the ruins of it into the orchestra he
offered to fight the whole company, and then
stalked out leaving a trail of objurgations behind
him. That sort of thing will have to he guarded
against, and disappointed souvenirists removed
promptly by the police. “ Shamus O’Brien,” at
the Royal, will be succeeded on Saturday by
“ The Black Flag.” Shamus will die sincerely
regretted.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus was blessed on Wed-
nesday, last week, with the special patronage o*
Lady Duff and the viceregal family, in conse-
quence of which the hippodrome may now be
regarded as an entertainment which no genuine
society person can stay away from without loss of
caste. The immediate result of the gubernatorial
patronage was that more people couldn’t get in
than usual, and that the disappointed hundreds
were more vociferous outside the tent than pre-
viously. Meanwhile, it is gratifying to know that
Commodore distinctly approves of Lady Duff, and
that the biggest lion seems of opinion that she will
prove a social success. Also, the rest of the
animals regarded her and the family with a
friendly eye.

George Dean’s youthful opera company is
doing good business with the “ Black Cloaks” at
Sydney Gaiety. It is becoming more and more
evident that this enterprise intends to be a suc-
cess. One at least of the characters whom The
Bulletin dropped upon with fatherly severity in
“ Rip Van Winkle ” has evidently profited by the
admonition, and those who were commended by
this paper still deserve commendation. Miss
Cynthia Carey and Miss Marie Dunoon in parti-
cular are two operatic planets that are becoming
increasingly visible above the horizon, and the
notes of the last-named lady’s voice should be
declared legal tender throughout New South
Wales if the State has any semblance of music in
its soul.

Sundry misguided characters arose at
Sydney Royal Standard on Saturday and pro-
ceeded to play “ Neck for Neck,” a sky-rending
shriek in which one member of the company is
deservedly hanged in full view of the audience,
and afterwards goes mad with a red gash on his
neck where the rope used to be. Apart from the
hanging, it is a miserable drama, more incoherent
even than Isaiah Cohen’s novel; and the ignorance
of the writer is like unto a high shot-tower keeping
watch over the desert. It might, perhaps, take a
little better if the hangee were more efficiently
suspended. The Bulletin hereby suggests that
the management should borrow Smedley, the
murderer —who is to be hanged anyhow, ana
might be hanged as comfortably at the Standard
as anywhere else—and suspend him in solemn
reality. Half the profits of the first night mign
go to the wife of the deceased as some small com-
fort in her bereavement and an alleviation ot he
sorrow. Then the diseased and wretched dp®
would at least have done some little good m i
time. N.8.-—We just remember that Smed y
hasn’t any wife ; he had one but he killed her.

“White Slaves” was produced at Mel’
bourne Royal on Saturday, “for one night only.”
After the third act, when three lots of policemen
had effected three distinct arrests at the same
aivful moment, and the whole visible drama was
writhing in the iron grip of the Law, there was a
sustained shriek for the author, J. J. Utting. As
a natural result of this demonstration the author
had, at time of writing, decided to carry “ White
Slaves” on for an indefinite period, and possibly
it is still on view. A villain of the basest descrip-
tion occupies the centre of this great literary pro-
duction. He keeps 19 inferior characters at bay for
about three hours. At the finish a dying boy
pulls himself together with his parting breath and
shouts the villain, by which time the comic publi-
can has also expired, and the production of certain
papers by a previous corpse enables the innocent
girl to marry the convict. The other girl
has been betrayed in the meantime, and is
doing well, so everything ends happily, although
the fate of a certain adventuress remains in doubt.
Possibly this lady joins herself in wedlock to the
Jew “sweater,” and ultimately chokes him with
a slop-vest at ninepence the dozen for the making
up. The Hebrew in question is undeserving of a
better fate. He keeps a “den” of nice, clean,
sowing-girls, who claim that they are “above
being tempted.” These are White Slaves, but
fortunately their spirit is not quite crushed for
want of vittles. In an unguarded moment the
greasy son of Israel proposes to violate the sanctity
of his den by kissing one of the fair Circassians,
whereupon they all rise as one slave and smite
him with bundles of “washing.” He is next
thrown out of a window, and the poor, toiling
virgins mostly take to the stage as a last resource.
The den is only one of many exciting incidents in
the course of a remarkable play, but it divides
chief honours with a certain “red room,” where-
unto the villain, during a long dishonourable life-
time, orders his principal accusers to be conveyed.

Amongst other Melbourne shows (mostly
in a despondent state), the newest is a Garden of
Eden, at the Rotunda Hall. The home of our
First Parents is composed of three large mirrors
and some rural decorations. A stranger entering
the garden sees himself repeated in an endless
number of similar festive spots, therefore the
beauty of the scene depends a good deal upon the
appearance of the parties who have paid to go in.
It is a clever idea, carried out on a not very
expensive scale. If the promoter is an agent for
Gardens of Eden, and is showing this as a sample,
he ought to take a few orders notwithstanding the
depression. To take one’s best girl into this sim-
ple illusion is bliss indeed, for her engaging smile
fascinates right on through the groves of Time,
and you are with her evermore, so to speak.

Various rumours having been circulated
as to the coming production of “ The Black

Williamson and Musgrove have, for three months

been spent. Mr. Musgrove has engaged some
important novelties, including several splen-
did dancers from the Continent, and has recently
returned to London from New York whither he
went specially to see the American production.

Here"are some Italian criticisms (all of one
date, March 16) on Melba in “Lucia,” at La
ocala :
hoMVßnuThe reclame with which she had been
preceded had rendered her public more critical than sym-
pathetic, but she was able to conquer them from the very
ret note. If the finish of her singing roused the public
.? e ™l U8 >asm, its marvellous flexibility amazed them ;
me in “ok allow her to finish her last brilliant trill in
umet, but drowned the last note in an enthusiastic
alien ; Melba had to appear four or five times in front
. curtain. I heard some of the old subscribers com-
pare Melba to Patti in her best days,
brlt^ OMM . KRCIO: —Her success was great; the theatre
.ik , out into frantic and intense applause, even before
eiast note had issued from the flexible throat of the
singer,
v*; Ir r 11EL Pofono :— lmmediately Melba made her
theai heai ' ( *’ a sense of delight pervaded the whole
Mail. *k “ umom ’ had been so busy concerning Nellie
naturally the first feeling of curiosity was
Slim/,! er more as woman than artist. Her hand-
awatj e figure, and sweet expression, at once
snnnt- B y |n P a lb. v - Her voice is truly marvellous for
whi r anait J’i equality, and liquidness of tone ; a voice
taoillr , r ' n 9 with the beauty of its timbre, and the
hfai-a t ° f '“ s Production ; a voice such as has not been
W i,. a J or m . an y years, and which can only be compared
tne voices of those individuals whose names are being
continually flung in one’s face by those people who, as
regards art, will only concede the rights of judgment to
antiquity. _ The cadenza was not permitted to finish with-
out being interrupted by an immense acclamation. And,
in fact, Melba performs prodigies of virtuosity; she
attacks her highest notes firmly and in perfect tune, and
this combined with her neat trills, her pearly runs and
perfect shakes, makes up extraordinary execution.
“A Pbrskvbrenza : —The fame with which she was pre-
ceded appeared exaggerated to no one, not excepting
that of the sculptural beauty of her charming figure and
noble and expressive face. . . . After the frantic
cadenza, in which she put to a hard trial with her flexible
throat, the sparkle of her dazzling notes, and brilliant
scales and trills, the flautist, Zamperoni, who kept himstlf
up to the level of the incomparable artist, there was a
burst of applause, and frenzied cries asking for an encore,
which was granted in the form of the last few bars of this
extraordinary vocal episode.
And then La Perseveranza, March 18: —More imposing
demonstrations of admiration, and greater manifestations
of enthusiasm than those which Madame Nellie Melba
obtained last evening at the Scala, singing before an
extraordinary select and crowded audience, I do not think
any artist could aspire to in those rosy dreams of glory
which are so often transformed into bitter delusions. . .
The famous artist appeared visibly moved by this pro-
longed applause as well as by the numerous offers of
splendid flowers in bouquets and baskets which were
handed to her on the stage at this moment. Few artists
can lay claim to having obtained such an uncontested and
triumphal success on the stage of La Scala. She also
conquered the public yesterday evening with the beauty
of her figure, to which are added the attractions of a
graceful and lofty carriage, and the noble expression of
her face, framed with an abundant wealth of hair with
strange changing shades of burnished gold, tints from the
Titianesque pallet, assisting greatly the other charms of
the artist. _ For ease of production, bright as precious
stones flashing in the sun, firmness of utterance, ductility
of timbre, sureness and audacious confidence in her vocal
means, for finish in modulation and coloratura, for true
artistic insight which—notwithstanding shakes, excep-
tional trills and acrobatic flights—does not deface or spoil
the purest manifestations of Donizetti’s genius, the cele-
brated artist made one perceive that she had reached the
highest pitch of perfection.

tbe w i nd i ng . up 0 f the old bank, one for the National
Mutual Life Association, and one final counsel for “ John
Hanrahan, a creditor.” A rush of eight counsel to oppose
the bare suggestion of the unfortunate British depositor
hayimr a voice in the disposal of his little five or six
mdllonB ! The awful anxiety exhibited on behalf of hasty
reconstruction in this Commercial Bank case, and the
aw f u i tales told as to why the anxiety is so palpable in
influential quarters, indicate that the Commercial Bank
ought to be wound-up once and for ever. The institution
is a source ot unwholesome excitement, seemingly. When
the country had once grasped the fact that the Commer-
c!al wa ? * oae bun S- th ® precious business should have
stayed bung. Its reconstruction scheme caused the news-
papers make miserable idiots of themselves, and the
new chairman was taken ill in the street owing to the
hysterical enthusiasm of the Fat Man and the meeting in
general.
* * *
The Bank ot Victoria’s shareholders’ list con-
tains “so many influential names,” that the original
arrangement for making depositors bear the brunt of
re-construction was just what might be expected. Judge
Williams has now ruled that £210,000 worth of shares
must he subscribed before he will sanction the new scheme
If the bank 18 such a s P lendld concern, the influential
sbarebo i derB bad better cover the subscription without
further haggling. They have had the dividends, and
theirs was the nominal liability in the case of the bank
going bung. And it did go bung,

At first, Judge Williams was disposed to stand
out for an actual enquiry into the Bank of Victoria’s
assets. Subsequently, he consented to accept them as
satisfactory on somebody s oath. Perhaps a judge will
desire information concerning the Commercial Bank’s
assets. In that case, at least five hundred oaths would be
avai i able . The Government, the Melbourne press, some
bank officials, and some big merchants we could name,
would lead a mighty demonstration in favour of the
Commercial’s soundness. There never was another bank
so full of soundness, as the institution which lent £lOO,OOO
to the Mercantile and took it back again in a hurry,

Canon Potter, of Melb., complains that the
übiquitous Fat Man cried “Shame!” very loudly when
he (Canon P.) accused the E. S. & A. Bank management
f oonfigcating the money of widows and orphans to rig
up a new bank with. “But such,” he writes, "is the

Embling, M.L.C., of “miserable hounds ” cele-
brity> told a Da viesian bank meeting, the other day, the
rea i estate market (in Victoria) would shortly revive,
“ All the unused coin which, during the recent panic, was
kept locked up will be set in circulation in the purchase
of real estate, which will again become a popular form of
investment.” Embling, in his mind’s “ wall ” eye, can
see a mob of Melbourne capitalists withdrawing their
hoarded millions from the family safe, and rushing off to
buy more land.

Dear Bulletin,—You suggest that the Crown
(in Victoria) is making a display of severity by “ jumping
on Matt. Larkin ” once more. The liquidators in Larkin’s
building society are the real movers in this case, and the
Crown, being obviously unable to assume the convict s
innocence, could not avoid taking further proceedings
when requested. It is a charge of forgery that they are
now bringing against Larkin. South Melbourne. [The
“ Crown ” could “ obviously enter a nolle prosequi for
Larkin as easily as for Davies. The “ Crown " can assume
anybody’s innocence in Victoria—if it wants to.—Ed. B.J

B. J. Fink’s halfpenny in the <£ composition
was staled for just what it was worth, without reserve—
as far as The Bulletin knows. There were no false pre-
tences about the distribution of that small, but interest-
ing, coin of British extraction. Since B.J.’s time
numerous Melbourne men have “got through’ with a
penny—less or more—on the strength of private pro-
mises that the smaller, or non-land-boom, creditors would
presently be paid in full. And now the parties who
accepted a penny and a promise are, in many cases,
whistling in vain for the promise to be fulfilled. Judge
Molesworth had been notified of this confidence-trick
when he suddenly refused to pass any more copper com-
positions. Asthe old song doesn’t say: For ’tis easy to
give the penny where the 19s. lid. will never be.

The relations of the Australia Hotel Co. and
the Anglo-Australian Land and Building Co. are a be-
wildering complication. The Anglo-Australian spent
most of its capital and reserves in building the really
palatial hotel, which proved more than it could swallow.
In fact, the caravanserai was almost the bigger enterprise
of the two, and when it was finished the situation was
very like that of the snake which has swallowed a bullock ;
there wasn’t enough snake to cover the bullock, and it
persisted in sticking out at the end. Then, owing to a
variety of tilings, it was resolved to float the hotel into
a nominally separate company, but, as the Anglo-Austra-
lian held 290,000 out of 300,000 shares it was practically
the same company over again. Of these shares 150,000
were fully paid up, and 140,000 were contributing. The
Anglo-Australian also held a £lOO,OOO second mortgage
over the hotel, so that things were tolerably mixed. Then
the financial institution burst, and, the mortgage falling
due about the same time, the liquidator demanded pay-
ment. This was where the fiendish vengeance of the
hotel co. came in. It acknowledged the £lOO,OOO liability
and made a call of £1 per share to meet it, consequently
the Anglo-Australian’s share of the call was just £140,000.
Not being able to meet this little demand the hotel co.
confiscated the mortgage in part payment, and then pro-
ceeded to dun the miserable bankrupt Anglo-Australian
for the £40,000 balance. This also being unobtainable,
the next step is naturally to sell the Anglo-Australian’s
140,000 shares for unpaid calls, and, as the market for this
stock is already depressed, and as a big forced sale will
inevitably make the bottom fall out of it entirely, the
chances are that the whole lot won’t realise £40,000, or
anything like it. Therefore, a perfectly possible result,
so far as we can make out, is that the Anglo-Australian,
through trying to realise its £lOO,OOO mortgage will lose
the mortgage, will lose its 140,000 shares, and will still
owe a balance which may yet absorb the 150,000 paid-up
shares as well.

Matthew Davies was chief friend and patron of
James Mi rams when that enterprising little financier
financed himself into a hopeless mess. But for unseen
circumstances, Davies would now, one presumes, be lead-
ing the movement to obtain a “Crown ” apology for the
conviction of Mirams on the charge balance-sheeted home
to him. James Service has undertaken to look after this
matter, however. Mirams is a lucky man in his cham-
pions. But he was unlucky to get into prison. His
building society went bung a couple of years too soon.
That’s all.

Millidge, late of the Mercantile Bank, seems to

Robert Reid, of the, Vic. War Department and
“rag” trade, came forth with a “ rallying speech ” at
the Bank of Victoria reconstruction meeting. These
rallying speeches by “leading men,” commencing with
the celebrated James Service oration at the Commercial

One of these days they will make droll historical reading.

The assiduously-worked job conferring upon a
far-reaching syndicate the use of the rapidly flowing
waters of the Colo and Grose Valley for electric-power-
generating purposes has, as we write, almost passed the
N.S.W. Legislature. The promoters will be able to float
this right in London for an enormous sum. It could just
as well have been floated by the State, which then could
have put into the Treasury the big profits that must
now go into the pockets of the Hall crowd—you can
also spell it Haul. This, with the passing of the Simpson’s
railway job by the same Legislature, is another feature of
the fast-dying session. The Bulletin, marking by how
many soi-disant democrats in Parliament and journalism
these nefarious schemes have been openly and secretly
supported, and knowing the arguments by which their
support has been secured, almost despairs of the future
of honest government.

Seemingly Matthew Davies is not to be arrested
by cablegram at Colombo. A detective is going after him,
however, with the sure and certain hope of getting there
a week after Davies is gone. Meanwhile, it begins to
appear as if the Victorian authorities very nearly failed
to be too late to arrest Matthew' at Adelaide ; they sent
their telegram when it seemed almost certain the Salier
was gone, but the vessel was behind time, and thus a
horrid accident nearly happened. Also, there is some
peculiar hitch about the Grand Jury which will probably
end by getting Matthew off on a technical point if every-
thing else fails.

In the boom, many Melbourne and Sydney
brokers, probably with a view of encouraging business,
published diagrams, indicating the rise of shares. For
instance, the rise in Melbourne trams was shown by a red
line carried up to the top of a page ; so with Broken Hill
and other well-known stocks. The writer has waited to
find a broker with pluck enough to present the other side
of the picture. It might be called the downfall diagram.

The acquisition of a fortune is not quite every-
thing in this world. For instance, there is in Australia a man
who undoubtedly promoted one of the biggest and most
successful mining swindles in history. Well, Nature has
taken her revenge, and even his bitterest enemy or most
wretched victim now has pity on him.

A Sydney draper who lately reduced wages has
drawn up a statement of his affairs for the last three
years, which, having been compiled only for his own
information and that of his friends, may.be taken as
bona-fide. It shows that the ground landlord has eaten
up all the profits throughout that term. The ground-
rent is £4OOO a year. The original landlord bought the
block for £650, but the tenant is threatened with a 60 per
cent, increase as soon as the lease falls in.

Kelly’s Block promises to be a live mine at last.
Just now it is almost the only moving thing on the
Towers Exchange.
* * *
Market mining is dead, and there is reason to
hope that it will never be revived on the Australian boom-
ing basis. Necessity will make men who have been living
on bluff or confidence work for a living, and as hitherto
laziness in Si dney begat laziness' in the mine, so now hard
work will beget hard work. Already the mineral fields of
N.S.W. are being raked over, and discarded lOdwt. reefs
are yielding more than tucker to tributors and others.
Poor as are the great bulk of the N.S.W. reefs, there are
many which -will pay when well and systematically
worked.

Judge Harding (Q.) rules that a mining co. may
legally mine under freehold property, but that the Crown
may demand its royalty. A freeholder owns his freehold
down to thecentre of the earth, with everything contained
therein, except the royal metals, which Include gold
bearing quartz. The decision is momentous, but need;
a Privy Council approval.

At the reconstruction meeting of the Brisbane
Permanent building and Banking Company, it was de

Whereupon uprose a porter on the A.U.S.N. Co.’s wharf,
80 years of age, with liabilities of £2 10s. upon
his head. He had earned 3s. that week. Could they lei
him have back bis £lO 11s. 2d.? Quote: “The chairman
(auctioneer Dickson, M.L.A.) expressed his sympathy
with the speaker, but it had been found necessary to draw

At Charters Towers (Q.) the Victory crushes
600 tons of about soz-stone a fortnight. Its dividends for
May totalled £22,500, in three allotments of £lO,OOO,
£5OOO, and £7500 each. This is something like a mine.
• • •
Mills’ Day Dawn United, one of the big mines
of the Towers, has in three years crushed 63,748 tons, for
61,5640 z. gold, and declared £75,000 in dividends. Capital
£300,000 ; its present dividend representing 32 per cent,
on capital.
# # •
The word “lode” is now introduced into the
Mills United report. The term, deceptive in this connec-
tion, we think, has not before been used on the Towers.
The United is eternally advertising ns a fact that the
supply of stone is illimitable, whereas the fortnightly
reports show nothing of consequence below the No. 6
level. Twenty-four and sixpence is, contends a corres-
pondent, an extravagant price for the shares in a co. of
300,000, and at the rate stone is.being raised, the present
supply can’t keep up for ever. The mine is certainly a
big producer and a really good property, but a false
impression has gone abroad respecting the quantity of
stone in sight.

The Brilliant (Ch. Towers) crushing for month
endi-d 17th May, 3370 tons for 36300 z., equal to loz Idwt,
18grs. per ton.’ Every return brings the ounce nearer.
# * *
The Brilliant (employing over 200 men) is
largely adopting the contract system. The gradual
decline in the yield per ton is making dividends small, and,
as at Broken Hill, the men must suffer.

The Victory moved its account (about ,£25,000)
from the A.J.S. to the B. of N.S.W. only a few days
before the smash. Managing-director Buckland was then
in Sydney. He is a nephew of the B.NJ3.W. chairman
and brother of the successful C. J. Buckland—who, by
the way, managed the B.N.S.W. branch at Gympie in the
early days.
« * *
The splendid Day Dawn reef, so far as the P.C.
and the Block are concerned, is now almost a memory.
These two mines must have paid something near to a
million in dividends. Manager Buckland, of the P.C.,
with his usual luck, struck, some two or three months ago,
a big reef underlying the old Day Dawn, and in the same
deep straight shaft went through several smaller reefs
very rich in gold, so this claim promises to have a re-
newed life.
# * *
Great was the fall of the syndicate at the late
Towers election. They took their thrashing badly, and
many of those active on the Labour side have since re-
ceived short notice. The attitude of the miners utterly
deceived the clique. Silence was read as consent and not
und°rstond as fear of being marked men ; consequently,
the syndicate agents went down terribly in wagers.

It is reasonably safe to infer now when an im-
portant development of carbonate ore, in a Broken Hill
mine, is announced, that some wretched little pocket has
been struck which would not have excised more than pass-
ing notice in the days of the boom. The carbonate era,
as far as the Broken Hill line of lode is concerned, is a
thing of the past.

getting all the gold contained in the ores, even appears

Barely six years ago the original holders of
Mount Lvall scrip could not raise “ tucker” on it, and
six months ago the holder of 2000 vainly endeavoured to

now being floated for £900,000 in 300,000 £3 shares, fully,
paid-up, of which half will be sold in London by Broken-
hill Knox. As Dr. Peters, the world’s leading copper-
expert, stakes his professional reputation on the show,
outside criticism is discounted. Most of the original

The Kentish mine, Bendigo, out of which Paddy

Proverbial as is tha wealth of
the Rothschilds, says an Australa-

that family is anything like so rich
as Lord Iveagh. His fortune, by
far the largest in Great Britain,

£8,000,000 represents his share in
Guinness’s Brewery. He has besides
£2,000,000 in London and North-
western railway stock. He never
touches speculative ventures of any
kind. When he and his brother
determined to float Guinness’s as a
company, they first took the pro-
posal to'the Rothschilds, suggesting
£8,000,000 as the amount of capital
to be offered to the public. Roths-
childs said that anything above

who has been resident there for quite half a
century, is the grandson of that Capt. Shea who
commanded the transport Scarborough, which
arrived in Botany Bay with “the First Fleet,” in
1788. Shea is a N.S.W. native, having been born
in Clarence-street, Sydney, in ’24.
Marcus Clarke’s newly-issued novel, “ Chi-
diock Tichbourne,” is by no means rubbish. A
blend of Scott, Dumas, and James, it only lacks
the actuality of “ His Natural Life,” and is
bookish, with all the staccato of Clarke’s news-
paper style. His friends are pleased with the
book, the fault being that it is too short.
Advice to Young Men Dr. Richards’ ad., p. 1.
Queen Victoria sympathised with the Aus-
tralian warriors—penniless, owing to their bank
having smashed—to such an extent that she —sent
each of them a portrait of herself to console him: —
The warrior bowed his crested head,
And tamed his awful spleen,
And gazed upon the gift, and said :
“ That’s very like the Queen ! ”
A German medico of parts, at present
‘ dead-beat,” was summoned in Melbourne last
week for stealing a skull, the property of the
Publio Library. He borrowed the skull, saying
lie was going to lecture on phrenology, but the
desire for a meal induced him to pawn the relic.
The poor doctor, however, is not much worse off
than the journalist reduced to the extremity of
pawning his own brains.
Parkes last week stated in the N.S.W. As-
sembly that in 1874 he was “a mere boy.” Parkes
was a guileless child of CO in those days, and used to
stand off his creditors on the plea of infancy. The
present writer distinctly remembers finding him
crying in the Domain about that time, and taking
him home. He had a short frock on, and he was
boo-hooing because he had dropped his toffee in
the mud.
With Frank
Clarke’s defeat of
Owe Owe Dangar,
for the Maeleay,
there are two
Clarkes and two
Clarks in N.S.W.
Assembly. Dangar
owes his defeat to
ratting from the
Dibbs Government
atacritical moment.
He swam out too
soon.
Ben. Douglass,
ex-president of Mel-
bourne Trades Hall
Council, is accus-
tomed to declare
that not one single
leader of the big
strike ever did a
day’s hard work.
But he is wrong.
When the boot-
trade went to smash
some years ago,
Trenwith turned up
on the wharf one
day, and sought a
job stevedoring.
The boss of the
gang didn’t think
him worth much,
and told him so,
but took him on.
The wharf-labourers
had seen greenhorns
tackle their work
before, and waited
to see this one cave
in. But Trenwith
didn’t — he went
right on, and when,
at the close of the
day, he held out his
torn and bleeding
hand for his pay,
the boss roughly
complimented him
on his pluck. “ I
aske'd for a day’s
work,” said Tren-
with, “ and I think
I’ve done it.” He
had ; but he hasn’t
tried stevedoring
since.
A man wearing a soft felt hat, a dingy
coat all unbuttoned, no waistcoat, a blue shirt on
full parade duty, and slop trousers, waited at the
Q. railway commissioners’ office the other day.
The, messenger took him up abruptly with a
“What is it?” “Is the secretary in?” “Yes;
what d’you want with him?” “I want to see
him.” “What’s your business?” “Tell him,
please, I have come about my pass.” “Oh, no,
you don’t ; we don’t have anything to do with
passes here—you must go to the Labour Bureau.
“Well, you’d better tell the secretary that ”
but the finish is better told by explaining that the
waistcoatless man was wharf-lumper Turley, M.P.
for South Brisbane, on the warpath for his rail-
way-pass, clad in full working uniform.
A correspondent: — “I only saw Matt.
Davies’ mouth and chin once. Until May, 1891,
he wore a long, yellow beard, and was reputed
handsome. The society papers coupled him and
Jim Shaokell, M.L.A., of Rodney, as the two
handsomest men in the Vie. Assembly. Well,
Shaokell never shaved, but Matthew Henry did
and the operation disclosed the weak, flabby,
sensual mouth familiar to people who have studied
the composite photos, of which Havelock Ellis is
so fond. Davies was too pachydermatous ever to
leave Victoria for Colombo because surgeon Fitz.
feared acute inflammation of the brain might set
in. His stupid mouth and prognathous jaw gave
him away exactly three months before the City of
Melbourne Building Society went bung in August,
1891, being the first of his packet of squibs.”
Old Col. Smith, of Ballarat, never did
much work with his muscles, but he mostly got
the Labour-vote. C. E. Jones was once opposing
him and running him close in the Sebastopol dis-
trict, where the Taffies were strongly inclined to
go solid for the man with the Welsh name. But
at a big meeting, the night before the poll, the
Colonel turned up in an aggressively new suit of
very shaggy tweed. That night, he said, he had
the honour to stand before the Welshmen of Sebas-
topol in a suit of tweed made in Sebastopol by a
Welsh weaver. The day was not far distant when
the whole of Victoria would be wearing Sebas-
topol tweed, and when the fame of its Welsh
weavers would resound through the land. Next
day the Taffy vote went solid for Smith —but they
never again saw him in that shaggy tweed suit.
The late G. D. Langridge, M.L.A. (Vic.,)
sometime Commissioner of Public Works, had a
pretty wit. One day a deputation from Burra-
budgery waited upon him concerning the necessity
for the erection of a gaol in the town. The chief
of the legation was particularly effusive in the
matter, so much so that Langridge, turning to
another ambassador close by, earnestly asked:
“ Why is he so anxious? Does he expect to be
run in soon himself?” After listening to all the.
oratory, Langridge, without a smile, said : “Gen-
tlemen, I knew very little about your town before,
but lam now convinced that it has a future. 1
have now made the acquaintance of a number ol
the town’s leading citizens (the deputation bowed),
and, after meeting them, though unable to state
exactly what the Government will do, I may say
that I am now fully convinced that in your town a
new gaol is urgently needed.” The deputation
left, wondering why the reporters giggled.
King O’Malley, a well-known Adelaide
(S. A.) insurance-drummer, broke out into the fol-
lowing oratorical measles in connection with a
recent aiding-distress movement: —
Are there no ladies in this garden city where every day
the maiden’s morning blush is being kissed by the per-
fumed breezes fresh from the classic heights of Lofty,
who have sufficient independence of character and
stability of mind to emulate their American sisters and
save the many unfortunate people that are now suffering
from the degradation of the possibility of beggary? Are
the beautiful rivers of South Australia to be permitted lo
flow to the broad bosom of the ocean swollen by the tears
of gentle woman’s wretchedness, weeping over hungry
infants on the withered breast of want ?
In Sydney, it sounds like a sensuous ecstaoy
of Danyelloconnorian yum-yum, and not an all-
round cadge.
A VERBATIM REPORT.
CABBY (pulling up at corner and addressing 13-year-old youngster): “Say,
sonny, what would your father say if he saw you smoking that
burnin’ mountain, hey?”
THE YOUNG AUSTRALIA : “I don’t care a blank blank what the old
blank says! Not me! I earn more blanky wages than the
blanky old man does, and he blanky well knows it. He ain’t
blanky likely to say anything while I supports the family.
Drive on, Cabby, and make yer bloomin’ fortune.”
Chief Justice Madden, who originally drew
up the Age’s defence to Speight’s libel-action, was
spoken of as likely to hear the case in Melb.
Supreme Court. The Law never makes allowances
for human nature. If a murderer confessed his
crime confidentially for the better “ instruction ”
of counsel, and if said counsel were suddenly con-
verted into a judge, his Honor, doubtless, would
be a fit and proper person to sit in judgment on
his former candid client, and direct the jury with
an unbiassed mind.
“ Lord Derby was never drunk, but drank
too much every day for 50 years.” Happy man !
The Prince of Wales and the Baked
'Tater Man.
The following story is told by the Prince of
Wales and the baked “ tater ” man: One night
lately the Prince of Wales and the Duke of
Edinburgh were returning home rather late.
When they passed Joe, the well-known “ tater ”
man - in the Pall Mall, they took a fancy to taste
his wares, and were accommodated by Joe with a
red-hot baked potato from the can, for which
they paid a penny each, and proceeded on their
way. Joe had recognised his customers, and on
the next day his “ tater ” can was decorated with
a glaring gilt sign showing the three feathers and
the legend “Purveyor to H.M.S. the Prince of
Wales.” He stationed his apparatus opposite
Marlborough House, to the Prince’s mingled
amusement and dismay. The Prince sent an
equerry to order him away, but Joe refused to
budge, and kept on doing a rushing business. At
last the Prince ordered Sir Francis Knollys to buy
him off, and the feathers were removed. This
shows the Prince to be a patron of “baked taters.”
We wonder if he suffers from liver complaint—
most stout people do; they feel a tired, languid
feeling in the morning, the urine is high-coloured
and scalds. They are constipated, suffer with
sick headaches, and feel generally miserable, but
there is no excuse, for a remedy—we refer to Clem-
ents Tonic —is within reach of all, and should at
once be resorted to or serious results must even-
tuate, and perhaps life be sacrificed, at the least
the disease will increase till a dangerous state is
reached. Take a lesson from the case of Mr.
Charles E. Howard, Royal Hotel, Morpeth. N.S.
Wales, who writes on February 3rd, 1893:—I
have since early school-d ays been more or less a
victim to the most excruciating pains in the chest,
attributed to chronic indigestion ; they caused me
no end of trouble and pains and even anxiety;
restlessness in my sleep, accompanied by the most
horrid dreams; each morning brought forth a
more languid feeling than the last. Having tried
all kinds of remedies without good effect, I was at
last induced to try Clements Tonic. After taking
three bottles of this wonderful health-giving
remedy a complete change came over my system,
for I feel I am now perfectly cured. I am only
too happy to add my testimony to the number you
have already received, hoping that this may meet
the eye of some other sufferer, and that they may
derive the same benefit that I have done. x°. u
are at liberty to make what use you think fit of this
testimonial. —I remain, yours gratefully, Charles
E. Howard, Royal Hot n l. Morpeth, N.S.W.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Speaker Cowley (Q.). Bully forMTlwraith!
“ The paltry, vulgar ambition of being an
Australian.” — L. F. Hey don, M.L.C. {N.S.W.).
Isaacs, when he joined the Vic. Cabinet,
thought he should have been Attorney-General.
Some crimson disclosures as to Melb,
Age’s grip of the Shiels Government are eagerly
looked for.
Another mural inscription : “ They want
us to be Thrifty so that they may Grab our
savings.”
The N.S.W. Labour Bureau has been
largely used to deport the dummies of one M.L. A.
to the back-blocks on passes.
Sir George Grey, interviewed after the
death of Mr. Ballance, had hardly one generous
word to say for the deceased Premier.
Rev. F. T. Brentnall (Wesleyan), of Bris-
bane, has attained the Q. Upper House Chair-
manship, which he has licked MTlwraith’s boots
to get.
Under a recently-enacted statute establish-
ing triennial Parliaments, the next Tasmanian
elections are now visible on the edge of the
horizon.
A grim reflection on Victorian politics and
politicians is the surprise and jubilation of the
Victorian people over the discovery in their midst
of one just man-.
“Whilst no aspersions whatever can be
oast upon Sir Bryan O’Loghlen’s honesty,” &o.—
Every morning and evening paper every day for
.over three weeks.
The South Australian income-tax returns
for this financial year : From personal exertion
4ld. in the =£l), £21,614; from oroperty (9d. in
the M), £32,930.
The S.A. Labour-party declines to pledge
itself either to Ministry or Opposition. It holds
the balance of power in the Assembly and refuses
to sacrifice its advantage.
The Victorian A.N.A. has at last proved
its virtue to exist. But it was a long while in
becoming alive to Matthew Davies and the Fat
Man who cries “ Shame ! ”
Dihbs postponed Government business at
three in the morning, in order to pass the Aus-
tralasian Rights Bill. He was forced to adjourn by
the solid opposition of the Labour-party.
At a N.S.W. country debating club
“In conclusion, gentlemen, I say that payment of
members is the only powder that will send the
bullet of universal suffrage true to its mark.”
Macintosh, M.L.C. (N.S.W.), actually
charges some of his confreres (vide Hansard) with
favouring the Ocean-street (Sydney) tramway be-
cause they’ve got property at South Head.
Ben Tillett : “The great flood of beer
steeps Liverpool to the lips, washes the furniture
out of the houses, washes the clothes off the backs
of its citizens, washes the virtue out of its men
and women.”
The six families rule Westralia :
In the House of Assembly, of 29 members, some 23 are
either blood-relations or closely connected by inter-
marriage the Legislative Council of eight (including ex-
officio) members being similarly constituted.
Since 1878, the consumption of spirits in
Maoriland has decreased 48 per cent., of imported
ale 60 per cent., and of ale locally manufactured,
22 per cent. Returning prosperity and “ labour
legislation ” are making Maoriland sober.
MTI wraith has beaten Griffith as the
champion promiser. He stands specially pledged
to—Roman Catholics and Orangemen ; licensed
victuallers and the teetotal party ; the banks and
their creditors; the Protectionists and |the Free-
traders.
The canny J. A. MTherson has been
elected Chairman (virtual leader) of S.A. Labour
M’s.P. He was chief organiser of the party in its
two big election triumphs, and up to date has
been proof against political temptation for the
sake of his party.
After the Fitzroy (Q.) election, M‘Carthy,
the unsuccessful Labour-candidate (beaten only by
50 votes, despite wholesale disfranchisement and
an enormous expenditure on the part of Callan’s
committee), was promptly “ sacked ” by a Mount
Morgan mine boss.
MTlwraith’s three nominations to Q.
Legislative. Council represent gold, water and
beer. Jimmy Tyson, Queensland’s golden fleece ;
T. B. Cribb, a stone-deaf storekeeper from
Ipswich, rabidly teetotal and pious; and Paddy
Perkins, whd is all beer.
At Mt. Morgan (Q.) “the necessity for
shortening hands” is the excuse offered for sack-
ing) by wholesale, wage-earners who took a pro-
minent part in the endeavour to return to Parlia-
ment Labour-candidate M‘Carthy, Piling up
faggots for future bonfires.
Politics in Victoria, for the last 15 months,
have consisted of little but Matthew Davies.
Governments stand and fall by one blessed gaudy
attorney, whose only claim to consideration was
that he threw other people’s money about, and
threw some of it into the tabernacle.
To Parkes’ eulogistic references to the
British constitution are now invariably attached
commendatory allusions to the constitution of the
United States. That is a characteristic developed
only within the last few years—with the growth
of Australian Republican sentiment.
How can a Minister of the Crown who
himself, by arrangement with a newspaper, writes
in his office-hours a rough-draft of its leading
article, issue a ukase to the effect than any em-
ploye of his department found writing to the
papers will be summarily dismissed ?
At time of writing O’Loghlen was recon-
structing his decision. Lowell :
I du believe in bein’ this
Or that, ez it may happen.
One way or t’other hendiest is
To ketch the people nappin’.
Salisbury has stated to an Ulster meeting
of Orangeman that he didn’t know, and never
spoke to, the deceased Parnell. Which, when you
turn it the other way about, only amounts to the
equally interesting fact that Parnell never spoke
to Salisbury. Always stand a fact on its head.
“Hume Black, special English bagman for
the Q. Government Meat Export Co., has received
numerous enquiries regarding the conditions of
settlement on the land in Queensland.” This is
diplomatic slang for saying that the great Par-
liamentary land-grab-railway syndicate is smelling
around.
The Maoriland surplus of £511,000 is a
splendid monument to John Ballance, and the
Labour Ministry generally. Ballance’s Ministry
was the first Labour Cabinet which ever held
office in Australasia, and it is the only one in
Australasia whose accounts have come out right
for many years past.
That most virile of Jingoes, Iludyard Kip-
ling, raises another whoop :
Fair is our lot—O goodly is our heritage!
(Humble ye, O people, and be fearful in your mirth)
For the Lord our God Most High
He hath made the deep as dry,
He hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the
earth !
This is a stave of “ A Song of the English,” the
official yell of the Imperial Institute crowd who
hooted Gladstone all round the building. It will
be seen that the Almighty’s services have been
exclusively secured by the J. Bull syndicate.
Bathurst (New
S.W.) National
Advocate devotes
a long leading ar-
ticle to denounc-
ing—
The silence with
which the British Na-
tional Anthem was re-
ceived by a crowd in
Bathurst, on Wednes-
day, gathered to see
the local volunteers put
through the usual An-
niversary drill.
It does not appear
that anybody hooted
or audibly cursed
that dismal dirge,
wedded to broken-
toothed doggerel,
that is forced on
writhing assembl-
ages in most afflicted
parts of the British
empire; the Ba-
thurst spectators
merely suffered it
and passively bore
their agony. But
because they didn’t
whoop, sky their
hats, and prance
round like a fool-
dog that has sud-
denly found the
long-lost master who
used to belt the joy
out of it at frequent
intervals, the Advo-
cate is horrified at
this exhibition by
Australians of their
‘ * contempt for au-
thority.”
The Australa-
sian credits “Mr.
Haynes ” with the
authorship of the
N.S.W. Education
Act. Evidently the
paper has got things
badly mixed. It
was not the Educa-
tion Act, but that
other valuable work,
Crick’s black eye, of
which John was the
author.
It is alleged that at least one Queensland
Oppositionist was compelled to withdraw and
leave the way clear for the MTlwraithian candi-
date by an intimation that a certain bank would
otherwise sell him up for his overdraft, it is
about time the directors rose up and denied—or
rather disproved—this and various other allega-
tions.
The Forrest Government (W.A.), pigtail-
scared by the smallpox epidemic, has issued a
proclamation that no Chinaman shall enter the
province for five years, “except with the permis-
sion of some duly-authorised person. ihis is
nkasing that no Chinaman shall be allowed to land
except a Chinaman who happens to live by
breathing.
Ex-Treasurer Garvan’s absence from
N.S.W. Parliament has saved one more split in the
Protectionist ranks. Acerbities, barely tolerable,
have disappeared with change of air, and he now
listens tranquilly to Ministerial projects which,
seven months ago, he would have fought- _ Garvan
smashed two Governments and is ambitious of
scoring further.
The Supreme Court Bill, which passed
N.S.W. Legislative Council, the other night,
makes, among other changes, trial by jury in civil
cases optional with the litigants. In June, 61
years ago, Mr. Bulrner presented a petition to the
Imperial Parliament from N.S.W. residents pray-
ing for trial by jury in all cases, civil and criminal.
Times change and change.
The “ Queensland United Licensed
Victuallers’ Association” circularised its mem-
bers to vote for MTlwraithians because the Oppo-
sition might re-impose an excise duty on beer,
while “ the published manifestoes of the Labour-
party are, in some respects, antagonistic to the
trade interests of Licensed Victuallers.” Bung
has no love for sober workmen.
Touching the coming election for North
Melbourne, caused by honest Wyllie’s decease,
the Argus remarks that “ the chances of a veteran
such as Mr. Laurens are not to be ignored.”
Alas ! no. Dreary old Laurens used to drivel for
the constituency in days of yore, and Smellbourne
has a weakness for old members because they seem
to have done so much for the country.
Had the Mitchell (Q.) workmen electors
acted on The Bulletin’s advice, and “criss-
crossed ” their contingent votes between Fitz-
gerald and Campbell, a labour-member would now
represent that district in Parliament. Judging by
completed events, Campbell’s chief object was to
“down Fitzgerald” at all hazards. Labour is
always biting off its nose to spite its face.
The excuse to be given to Downing-street
for not receiving another Governor in S. A., after
Kintore’s departure, is that the mansion of the
Deputy-Lord’s Anointed wants an expensive
overhauling. Some enthusiastic Democrats are
willing to bet that, should Chief Justice Sammy
Way receive the appointment, no foreign magnate
will ever reign in Adelaide afterwards. So mote
it be !
In the early days of the Palmer (N.Q.)
rush, troopers were sent to the various mining
camps to take the names of electors and round
them up, as it were; now, authorities move
Heaven and earth to prevent as many qualified
men as possible from voting at all. This, how-
ever, is not retrogression. It is only a spasm of
BIBLICAL.
SQUATTER MAC ( although strictly religious tries to make his hands work
Sunday as well as the rest of the week) : “Don’t you think it
would be a good day for burning round the paddock, Tim?
Better nor laying about, man.”
TIM : “To-day’s Sunday.”
SQUATTER MAC : “Well; the bible says if your ass fall down the hole on
the Sabbath, you’re to pull it out.”
TIM: “Yes; but it don’t tell yer to go round all the blessed week to find
a hole to put the ass in on Sunday, though.”
success on the part of the tricky minority, and
the prelude to a definite revenge by the majority.
Peacock, M.L.A., was said to have pro-
voked a letter from the Vic. Crown Law Depart-
ment requesting him to explain what he meant by
saying something disrespectful about Davies’
“soft” prosecution. Peacock, at latest dates,
had received no such letter, and was asking for it.
Perhaps the letter was written but not issued, as
was the case with those celebrated writs for
criminal libel that never got served upon Simpson.
Dear Bulletin, —At a Q. station which
was a polling-place there were 41 votes polled—
-28 for a squatter. The station storekeeper was
presiding-otticer ; the station manager (the store-
keeper’s boss) was scrutineer for the squatter can-
didate. The numbered corners of the ballot-papers
were not gummed down, but only fastened with
patent paper-fasteners. Do you mean to tell me
that that station manager doesn’t know how every
local elector voted ?— Scribbler.
The Q. law as to Chinese immigration is
that a steamer can only land a maximum number
of Chinamen equal to one per every 500 tons of
tonnage. Well —a China steamer leaves (say)
seven Chinamen at Batavia, to be brought on by
(say) a 8.1. boat; further, it tranships (without
landing) several more to Australian coasting
steamers; and, last of all, it lands its own per-
mitted quota of Chow. How is that for driving a
steamboat through an Act of Parliament ?
“ Should he be arrested, a police-officer
will leave for Colombo by the next steamer to
bring him back to Melbourne.” They couldn’t
dream of sending the police officer away imme-
diately, armed with the same warrant that missed
tire at Adelaide, with a view to saving time, “ in
the event of a true bill being found against ex-
Speaker Davies.” Thus early, The Bulletin
prophesies that Matthew will not be arrested at
Colombo. There is a twinkle in the Fat Man’s
eye which means a good deal.
Parliamentary institutions must be playeu
out, and the Revolution at hand, considering tha
callous indifference with which the English Par-
liament treats an affair like the Hull strike. The
House of Commons reminds one of the Laputans
or Strudbugs, requiring to have their long ears
flapped by attendants who call attention to other
fellows kissing their wives. Take all history, and
you will see this is the unvarying phenomenon—
as with the French Constituent Assembly, at the
outbreak of the Revolution.
How Dangar and Trickett resented Cupid
Smith’s congratulations in N.S.W. Council over
the final passage of the Electoral Bill ! “ This
splendid measure, which my hon. friends strove
so hard to render perfect.” Greasy
Dangar and Trickett’s efforts to “ render perfect”
the Bill simply consisted in trying to wreck the
one-man-one-vote principle, and their ultimate
cave-in was the price they paid for exemption
from the income-tax. Bah ! It was like con-
gratulating a man on the loss of his right hand.
Just now it is interesting to remember
that Duffy was Attorney-General for Victoria in
the early days of the Shiels Ministry. It is more
interesting to remember that Duffy, having come
to verbal blows with Judge Hodges, over the
latter’s light sentencing of G. N. Taylor (who was
subsequently tried again on a larger charge and
sentenced some more), was pushed out of the
Shiels Ministry and promised the Speakership,
which ultimately fell to Thomas Bent, Esq. The
question arises—would ten banks have closed
their doors if Duffy had remained Attorney-
General all through the past year? Also, why
was the gentleman who disapproved of light sen-
tences shunted just as Matthew Davies began to
look like a troublesome matter ?
Dear Bulletin, The six-months-resi-
dence franchise qualification is the chief engine
by means of which the Queensland capitalist de-
frauded Labour out of its vote at the late election.
On the Australian Pastoral Co.’s stations in the
Maranoa district, men were discharged in large
numbers a few weeks before the election, not-
withstanding the certainty that their services
would be required in a short while for lamb-cut-
ting and mustering. They were “sacked,” appar-
ently, only to make them “travel” and thus
“disfranchise” themselves.” The majority of
bush-hands in Queensland are disfranchised slaves
and must remain so until every sane male adult is
permitted to vote, irrespective of what part of
the country he may happen to reside in.—Yours,
G.L.
The diary of Townshend, the crank who
attempted to murder Gladstone in the cause of
Unionism, is a beastly disagreeable adyt. for the
great Tory party. Tins pleasant maniac kept a
record of how he was gradually worked up to
homicidal frenzy, the said record consisting chiefly
of extracts from the speeches of Salisbury, Bal-
four, Saunderson, Parson Kane, and others, urging
the Ulster men to armed “ resistance,” bloodshed,
and civil war. After each extract followed a
moral reflection by Townshend himself, to the
effect that murder'couldn’t be wrong when advo-
cated by such authorities. The last extract
evidently settled the question. It was copied out
carefully, and following it came a remark that

Dear Bulletin, —You do not yet seem to
have fully fathomed the depths of duplicity to
which the “ fat ” men and their journals are pre*
paved to descend in order to injure the first
Government of Maoriland elected on the “one-
man-one-vote ” principle. Were Ananias to
resurrect and visit Maoriland, he would be con-
sidered a veritable George Washington in com-
parison to the “ specials ” of the Conservative
journals. There is no dissension in our Cabinet,
there has never been any, and there is not likely
to be any ; there was no scramble for the vacant
leadership when John Ballance died ; and the
Ministry is not at all likely to go back on anything
their lamented chief held dear. Mr. Ballance’s
particular friend, Robert Stout (another friend of
the people, although he was mistaken enough to
accept a title), has not come forward for the
Inangahua seat to oust “ Dick ” Seddon from the
Premiership, but because he was asked by his
dying friend to do his utmost for the party and
the people. Stout is sure to lose business and
money by re-entering politics, and the canards
circulated by the paid tools of the “fat” men
arise from the utter incapability of their masters
to understand a man doing anything for love.
Otherwise your leader of May 6 was accurate. —I
am, &c., One Who Knows.

There are pleasant times ahead for the
“New Australians,” who start this month. They
are going in a small, wooden sailing vessel, and
will reach Cape Horn about the coldest and most
horrible season of the year, when the sun rises at
half-past nine and sets at half-past two, and there
are nineteen hours of darkness. The winds are
even more uncertain off the Horn than they are in
most other places, and a sailing ship may beat
about for four weeks or more, before she struggles
round that stormy headland. It is a joyous ex-
perience, weltering along in that pale-green sea,
with the crew incessantly shovelling the snow off
the deck, and scraping the ice off the rigging, and
wrestling with the frozen sails, while all the
fiends of the frozen zone howl in the blast over-
head, and the huge green waves which roll
round the world without a break in all the 360
degrees of longitude incessantly rush after the
frozen ship. The temperature is some unspeak-
able depth below freezing - point, and dreary
greenish or bluish or dead-white icebergs wallow
along in the troubled waters, and a pallid, watery
sun hangs like the bald head of a devil in the
watery sky. The man who has once gone round
the Horn per sailing ship in mid-winter never
desires to go there again. It is better to get out
at Valparaiso and walk across.

When the Austrian Archduke was in
Sydney the other day he wanted a dog—a fox-
terrier, you understand —and money was no object
so long as he got a first-class animal. Several
dogs were submitted, but he wouldn’t look at
them—they were not class enough. At last a
message was sent to a gentleman known as a
breeder of the very best fox-terriers in Sydney.
He sent three dogs for the Archduke’s inspection,
the prices ranging from 20 to 30 guineas, and an
old servant of the owner took the dogs for the
Royal potentate’s inspection. His Highnessgreatly
fancied one dog, and, after jabbering away in
Czach or Croat or something, he made an offer
which was translated to the old man as follows :
“The Archduke much likes this dog and will
give £3 for him.” This fairly staggered the old
fellow. “ Three pounds for that dog?” he said —
“ you ought to buy dogs, you ought! Why , we
loouldn’t take £S for that dog’s tail." They didn’t
deal.
Why do so many
“respectable” women
always steal when
they think they have
a chance ? The other
day, a gorgeous
dame, arrayed in
purple and fine linen,
with leg -of - mutton
sleeves of the fullest
dimensions, drove up
in her carriage to a
fashionable Sydney
doctor’s. She was
shown into the wait-
ing-room, which hap-
pened to be un-
tenanted ; on the
table was a terra-
o ilta bowl of water-
lily bulbs just sprout-
ing. On the maid
returning, after an-
nouncing the visitor,
she surprised her
wrapping her hand-
kerchief round one
of the wet bulbs
(value, about six-
pence) and conveying
it to her pocket. The
girl was Scotch, and,
with the thoughtful-
ness of her nation,
merely remarked;
“Better put it back,
ma’am, it will die out
of water ! ” The lady
was so disgusted at
the impertinence of
the maid that she did
not wait to see the
doctor.
Another case in
paint happened on the
Sydney suburban line
last week. A lady
got out and left her
umbrella on the seat.
At next station a
well - dressed woman
was observed to walk
up the aisle, when,
at the seat whereon
the forgotten utn-
brella lay, she dropped her own on top of it, then
picked up the two and inarched off.
The “ Australian soldiers” in England are
being boomed by cablegram until they are a weari-
ness to the soul. Almost every day a fresh item
comes along setting forth that they have met
somebody, or been noticed by somebody, or some-
body has been graciously pleased to recognise
them in some way or other. For instance ;
The Queen has commanded the presence of Major F. C.
Hughes and Captain Dodds to an evening-party at
Buckingham Palace, on Monday next.
General Lord Roberts, late Commander-in-Chief of
India, invited Corporal D. D. Mackinnon, a member of the
Victorian Horse Artillery team, into the Royal box. He
shook hands with him.
Just think of it. He shook hands with him!
Their flesh oame into contact —the flesh of a lord
and a plain Australian corporal!! There was a
joining together of cuticle !!! Mackinnon felt —he
actually felt—Roberts, and, what wasmore, Roberts
felt him! !!! And it is so rarely that Roberts
or any other lord does feel an Australian that the
fact is well worth cabling 16,000 miles. The
Australian teams will come back, after a little
more of this sort of thing, in a beastly state of
“ loyalty.” That result is absolutely inevitable.
’Scene : Occasion of Governor Duff’s land-
ing at Sydney. Two women, each carrying a
baby, struggling to get down to Prince’s Stairs in
time. The fatter of the two sees a big crowd
hanging over the rails at the old Manly Wharf,
stops and wedges in amongst the crowd. Two
minutes pass, other female gets impatient and
calls out, “ ’Ere, I say, ’Lizer, ain’t yer cornin’ ;
we’ll be too late for the bloomin’show.” Other
female, in impressive tones, “Oh, rot’im ! Let
’im go. Dash “yer old Guvernor, I’m agoin’ ter
stay ’ere and watch these coves* a-fishin’ for the
dead baby.”

English Tory papers have stated that Glad-
stone, to spite the Gracious Queen, will not pro-
pose a wedding grant for the Duke of York and
his “intended.” This class of item is specially
invented for the use of the cable liar. The G.O.M.
doesn’t condescend to “nark” his Sovereign
Lady. He will do what is usual in these cases,
unless he has political reasons for not doing it.
As a fatherly old party, with an approving eye
for a plump, pretty girl, he would doubtless prefer
' i WlcijL
NO “RUN” FOR HIM.

to see May “ nicely provided for.” It isn’t his
money.

Even the Imperialists must admit the
gradual wane in the enthusiasm with which
British Governors are received in Australia. The
machinery for working up a furore over the advent
in Sydney of Gov. Duff was a dead failure. Mere
curiosity, not monarchical devotion, obviously
ruled the crowd. “Hats off!” shouted excited
officials along the line as the carriage approached,
and the peremptory order raised many a laugh,
but nary a hat.

A Melbourne bookmaker che other day
sued for divorce from his wife on the ground of
her alleged adultery with one “De Vere.” The
evidence disclosed that the real name of “De
Vere ” was Gilligan. Now it is a great social fact
that the De Veres are usually Gilligans in dis-
guise.
« • #
A Southern legal dignitary happened
recently to find the siren of his bijou villa enter-
taining, as is understood to be usual in such eases,
his trusted friend. The row which followed
brought the police in, who, in the end, were the
only parties who profited by the transaction —to
the extent of some £7O. Of such are the terrace of
houses and the gold watch and chain.
Dear Bulletin, —Concerning your remark
that the threatened invasion of female compositors
would best be met by admitting them to male-
union membership. This would, I fear, lead to
wholesale reduction of wages. Women seem never
happier than when working at some “genteel”
employment for next to nil. A case in point.
The charge in Sydney for writing 3-line addresses
on envelopes (for circulars, etc.) was for long ss.
per 1000, and little enough, too. A firm of women
has now reduced this to 35., a rate at which body
and soul must only be but loosely held together.
And yet one rarely meets with a woman who can
cook even a chop properly, and domestic servants
are at the usual premium.—H.V. A.

Chief Justice Way (S.A.) presided at a
foundation-stone function, at Way College, Ade-
laide, the other day. The inscription-mason set
one of the little man’s titles forth as “Leiutenant-
Governor.” The Training College principal
pointed out the error to a parson-committee-man,
who looked at the word and, with frost-bitten
pity, said —“Oh, they don’t spell ‘lieutenant’
with an ‘f ’ now, you know.”

Mount Gambier (S.A.) has earned dis-
tinction by tendering a farewell ball to Dr. Craig,
a retiring Anglican parson. What is looked for
now is a prayer-meeting in honour of some popular
bookmaker.
The average
Sydney native of 12
years, says a visitor,
has only three am-
bitions. To smoke
a cigarette through

and to wear his hat

head so as to show
his bang.

A few years ago
a N.S.W. railway
servant was dis-
missed, but solaced
with a pension of
about .£1 per week.
He has managed to
live on that sum
ever since, and says

dreams of doing
another day’s work.

Directly a shearer gets a stand in any
Western (Q.) shed he now receives a begging-
letter from a district parson, setting forth the
necessitous claims of “religion,’ and asking him
to sign a document authorising the deduction
from his wages of funds to support the Fireblast
church :
A Maoriland inkslinger forwarded a town
weekly some Waikato district social statistics, and
specially emphasised this item— “ Marriages, 7.

A sweet, shy little thing, under 17, the
chief exhibit in a late Rockhampton (Q.) abduc-
tion case, not only denied that she was abducted,
but swore that she abducted the man. She des-
cribed feelingly how she rounded up and saddled
the horses, leading by a halter the moke Adonis
rode. Further, she told the court that prisoner
had informed her that he was a defenceless married
man, but a trifle like that wasn’t going to prevent
her rescuing him from domestic slavery.

An old woman of 70 years, poor and
friendless, arraigned before a Sydney bench for
thieving one day last week, pleaded kleptomania.
The court could be heard laughing on the other
side of the street, as it sent her away for two
months.

The Maharajah of Patiala, we read, has
married an English lady, Miss Florrie Bryan,
who, before the ceremony, was received as a
member of the Sikh religious community. As
years roll on we shall have more of this. The
supply of American millionaires, German princes
with an income of 10,000 pfennig per annum, rich
Hebrew usurers, and fat brewers, cannot possibly
hold out'much longer ; and then we shall see mail-
boats packed fpll of English beauty going out to
India and marrying any sort of spindle-shanked
nigger that can give it “ a position.”

A Christchurch (M.L.)gentleman who had
ideas about bleaching clothes by electricity, lately
fixed up a wire for a clothes-line and connected it
with a strong battery. He was called out after
dark by fearful howls in the garden, and going to
the spot he found the lady who lived next door
writhing in agony and vainly trying to let go a
wet table-cloth and a garment which she had
grasped, one in each hand. She hadn’t meant to
steal them, but she had been overcome by the
yearning to find out whether the other woman’s
table-cloth was as fine as her own and whether she
had real lace on her night-dress, and she had leant
across the fence to feel these two articles. Then,
in some horrible and unexplained manner, they
seemed to seize her and drag her bodily over the
palings, and after that she had a vague idea that
she was hanging by the hands and someone was
beating her with a red-hot poker. Before the
current could be turned off the articles tore in two
and let her down with a whack on the garden-
path, and then, feeling that the situation was too
difficult of explanation, she gathered up her skirts
and ran for it. But next day she apologised by
letter, and peace was nominally restored.

Dear Bulletin,—Don W. W. Head—
the partner of Don Billy Lane—of the New
Australia expedition, assures the Sydney
Telegraph that the intending emigrants
are noc gathered in barracks at Balmain
but are mostly “staying with friends” in
Sydney. If there isn’t a “ barrack ” at Balmain,
then what does Don W. W. call that establishment
where about 70 Paraguayans pig together, and
where all the old newspapers and orange-peel in
creation seem to be chucked over the fence, and
where the right-of-way is never cleaned because
the argonauts are too busy dreaming about the
Paradise that is to come, and where the children
of the expedition invade the next man’s garden
and blaspheme volubly when they are told to quit ?
If the New Australians are staying with friends
there are altogether too many of them staying
with one friend, and they don’t seem to have
picked out a very clean friend either.—B.B.

Even the worm will turn. Even a saint
of God may be provoked to retaliation. A certain
Rev. Father in a Sydney suburb, before proceed-
ing to read out the late “ Easter Dues ” list, made
some severe remarks about the meagreness thereof,
lie then proceeded to reel off the list of donors.
The three to five-pounders got the places of
honour. Then: “The followin’ gev’wan pound
each;” and there came a row of names. “The
followin’ gev’ ten shillin’s each,” and more names.
Here the holy man, fixing a calm, steely glare on
the front seats, observed: “The followin’ </ev :
nuthin’ each.” At this stage, several prominent
citizens suddenly began to squirm in their seats.
One whitewaistcoated potentate was too much
affected to move, and was observed to fan him-
self flabbily with a handkerchief until he finally
collapsed, and was dragged out in a broken-up
condition.

The Earl of Longford, we read, was lately
summoned for knocking off the tile of a disloyal
newspaper man who refused to uncover to the
tune of “ God Save the Queen.” The charge was
proved; but the case was dismissed, and it is
understood that the haughty British peer has a
divine right to “ stouch ” the nail-keg of any per-
son who refuses to salaam to his discordant fetish.
The writer is here reminded of an incident he
witnessed in a Castlemaine (Vic.) bar during the
recent Patterson-Longmore mill. A supporter of
Longmore’s was holding forth on politics to an
irrigating crowd, and presently relapsed into
expressions of vitriolic contempt for the Queen,
Albert Edward, and all the royal family. “ Why,
hang it, man !” exclaimed one moistened elector,
“ you are the very fellow who fired me out of
Merton’s pub. at ' Eaglehawk three years ago
’cause I wouldn’t drink the Queen’s health with
you !” “So I am,” replied the orator, regretfully,
“and do you know I’ve been looking for you for
over two years to ask you to kick me? Kick me
hard, please.”

Dear Bulletin,
—Yes, the Tasma-
nian “ half-castes ”
(thepureTasmanian
aborigines, as you
know, are utterly
extinct, but their
blood runs in the
veins of the mixed-
bloods of whom I
am writing) do eat
much mutton-bird,
the season for which
is just over. Mut-
ton-bird is a dietary
physic, and Tas-
manian half-castes
are an intelligent
race. Nearly every
man of them is able
to build a boat, and,
as boat-sailors, they
are unsurpassed.
On Cape Barren Is-
land (tire township)
they have a nice
school—daily atten-
dance, about 30;
also a church, built
by themselves, un-
der the superinten-
dence of E. Stevens,
schoolmaster and
amateur parson.
Bishop Montgom-
ery provided the
material. The May-
nard family (li ving
on Flinders) con-
sists of really
fine fellows big
men, with hand-
some features and
flowing beards. The
average half-caste is
decidedly “dicky on
his pins,” and was
“ born tired.” He
plays the accordeon
well, and is fond of
step-dancing to the
accompaniment of a
“squarie ” (bottle of
gin), music, pipe
and tobacco; nothing in the world can trouble
him while it lasts. One half-caste lady has a
beard that many a man would be mightily proud
of. But the half-caste girls are mostly good-
looking.—Yours, &c., Mutton-Bird. Flinders

“Looking Backward ”Being Tried.
Editor Bulletin,— lt may interest your readers
to know that preliminary steps are being taken in
this part of the world to demonstrate that
“Looking Backward” is capable of practical
interpretation. Land has been obtained maniple
area, and it is proposed to build, h/l co-opcvatnc
labour, the Mexican Western Railway, in icturn
for further concessions. ,
An idea of the whole scheme: The Credit
Fonoier C 0.,” numbering some 60,006 members,
has been in existence for some years, and claims
that it is not a follower of Bellamy, but that
Bellamy got the whole of the main ideas in his
novel from the Co.’s literature ! President, A.
K. Owen ; office, Room, 723, No. 32 Nassau-street,
New York, U.S.A. . .
At present, there is only actual room in the
forefront for hardy pioneers, able and willing to
face and stand pioneer hardships. In any case,
no new member is received without a permit
granted by Owen, and those coming without will
find themselves stranded in a foreign land, where
a foreign tongue prevails, amid hostile Indians,
and a long way from any where.
Topolobarnpo Bay is in the Gulf of California,
Mexico. There are two harbours, an outer and an
inner. On the bar of the outer harbour at low
tide, there is a depth of 25ft. When the pro-
jected railway is finished, the Australian
and China mails, if landed at lopolo-
bampo, will be transportable to New York
in three or four days less time than by the
present route, Topolobarnpo being that much
nearer to all the Eastern and Southern cities of
America than is ’Frisco, in the line of route under
consideration.
The inner harbour is 40 miles long and from
7 to 10 wide, and is possibly unequ tiled in the
world for yachting, &o. The scenery is fine, in
my opinion, Topolobarnpo possesses as picturesque
a panorama as that seen from the summit of
Mt. Kden, Auckland, Maoriland —which Bouci-
cault declared to be the finest in the world, ft is
superior as a site for a future model city, which
has been prospectively named “Pacific City •

and natural advantages sufficient to exceed I ans

Climate, clear and bright, neither too hot nor too

The colonists have already dug an irrigating
canal, erected a Custom House, constructed
several roads, and made numerous surveys. The
new city is plotted, but no permanent residences
have yet been erected. The intention is to keep
ahead of, or at least abreast wdth, all the most
advanced and perfected designs in houses, streets,
means of transport, parks, halls, theatres, &c.
Any suitable scheme of new co-operative life
may be tried here —the “ Looking Backward ”
idea; the “Freeland” scheme, as outlined in
Cowdry’s “A Tramp in Societythe individual-
competitive - co-operative and profit - sharing
schemes of Michael Flurscheim (Ger.); Henry
George’s single-tax proposals—if he or any of his
followers choose to come and try it; &c., &c.
Lands and all public utilities are to be vested in
a central body, corporation, or trustee, the
functions and powers of which are to be defined
by charter, tightly preventing the incursion of
any “syndicate” and impregnable to capitalistic
“cornering ” ; the lands to be so vested that they
cannot be sold, or diverted from the original pur-
pose. This central body can lease land to any
bona-fide body of individuals, and it may build
irrigating canals, transport lines, piers, ware-
houses and public utilities generally, but it must
not engage in the manufacture of any articles of
merchandise, nor in production of any kind ; these
things are to be left to the several schemes, as
each may think best. Individuals may obtain
individual residence lots, or acres for cultivation,
for the terms of their lives and those of their
children, but only to the first generation, after
which the lots revert to the central company. In
short, the land-title is a use for life, or lease.
There are at present some 500 people here, doing
purely pioneer work—clearing brush, making sur-
veys, building roads, and preparing land for culti-
vation. Even these 500 are divided into two
groups—one group recognising individual control
of products, and pooling its produce with its own
agency ; the other working under a Board of
Directors, with departmental overseers. The
former have some 267 acres in process of being
planted, by putting in little farms up to 40 acres.
The latter have cleared and planted 12.) acres,
with 700 orange-trees in orchard and 1000 in
nursery, 300 banana-plants, 1000 grape-vines,
10,000 strawberry-plants, and garden and field
crops. The first efforts, of course, are to make the
colonies self-sustaining, by producing a surplus to
get groceries and outside necessaries. Manufac-
tures will be attempted later, and it is believed
that capital can be borrowed at 3 per cent, for this
purpose.
The project is an attempt to find practical
answers to theoretical social queries. If it fails,
there will be one more tombstone over dead human
endeavours and hopes ; if it succeeds, the millen-
nial dawn is not a chimera, and the co-operative
system will supersede the competitive. If this
letter rouses Australian interest, I shall be glad to
furnish any further details asked for, and we
eagerly look for suggestions and comments from
The Bulletin.— Yours, R. J. Kendall. Topolo
bampo Bay, Sinaloa, Mexico, March 25, 1893.
The Pall Mall Gazette errs in stating
that Livingston Hopkins “took Phil May’s place’ -

Hopkins was attached to The Bulletin staff
years before Mr. May came to Australia.
The tone of Melbourne Argus demo
craticises steadily, but the repenting journal con-
tinues to frighten the uneducated with special
articles, reprints of lectures, and “ high-class
matter which only a few care to read. Such
things are really extras to a bulk of general in-
formation which equals the whole supply of news
in the Age. Yet, somehow, the working man
judges the paper by the portions he might avoid
and sums it up as “ dry hash.”
Whoever has need for a plough, or other
agricultural implement, should call on Messrs.
J. & C. Howard, of 280 g Pitt street, Sydney,
where will be found the largest and most varied
stock in the city. Howards’ ploughs, in par-
ticular, include many valuable varieties obtainable
from no other makers. The wrought-iron Colonist
plough, in seven different sizes varying from
1161 bs. to 3721b5. weight, has been in use for many
years, and lias established a better record than
any tiling else of its kind. For deeper work the
firm’s digging plough, which breaks up the soil to
any depth from three to 16 inches, is unrivalled.
The Governor digging-plough is a larger variety
of the same implement with sundry additions and
improvements. It cuts both deep and wide, and
kills and buries everything smaller than a tree
that comes in its way ; also, it gets oyer twice as
much ground as an ordinary plough with no extra
horse - power. The double - furrow Colonist
plough—a machine which lias proved its ability
to demolish even the tussac grass of Maori-
land, an obstruction which is almost as solid
as a cathedral—has a special recommendation, in-
asmuch as it is easily convertible into a double-
furrow digging plough, and thus the buyer has
two machines for the price of one. The “ Simplex”
patent steel harrow is another of Messrs. Howard’s
specialities ; it folds up into a small compass, and
is stronger and lighter than any other in the
market. The firm lias taken 46 first prizes in
England for ploughs, harrows, horse-rakes, hay-
makers, straw-trussers, &c., and has also taken
prizes in all the provinces of Australasia. At
Melbourne Exhibition in 1881 it scooped in no
less than 10 first awards, and in Maoriland alone
has taken enough medals to salt a gold mine. The
firm’s catalogue includes every kind of implement
that can be wanted by the farmer, pastoralist,
susrar-planter, or vigneron, all cheap, durable, and
of the very best construction.
Our Boys.
To see the large crowds anxiously scanning and
minutely criticising, the various telegraphic
advices of the progress of our Australian
cricketers, which are placed outside the various
news agencies, is one of the daily experiences oi
Sydney life, and the interest evoked is not un-
warranted, for “Our Boys ” are, once more, mak-
ing the Old World players, play second fiddle at a
game peculiarly their own. Their skill and stamina
spring from the possession of strong nervous, as
well as physical power, and so long as the Aus-
tralian Eleven continue to brace up their nervous
and muscular systems by the use of Australia’s
premier remed} 7 , “ Marshall’s Tonic Nervine,” so
long will the spectacle be witnessed of delighted
crowds gazing at the records of their wondrous
successes. Concerning “ Marshall’s Tonic Nervine”
Professor Cansdell writes :
“ It gives me great pleasure in recommending to my
athletic friends your well-known ‘Tonic Nervine,' which
is the best strengthening tonic I have ever taken.”
And this eminent athlete’s opinion is verified by
the redoubtable and unconquered Larry Foley,
“ who should know, you know,” for he states :
“I must candidly admit that I have used it for years,
and always found it wonderfully effective when feeling a
little off, and I not only speak from my own experience,
but have heard numbers of the boys (athletes) say that,
for training purposes, they have found nothing equal to
it when taken in a little water twice a day.”

THE EQUITABLE BUILDING SOCIETY,
Brisbane.
THE cessation of BANKING CONVE-
NIENCES throughout the Australian
Colonies, and the subsequent exclusion of in-
tending Subscribers, rendered it impossible to
complete the issue of 103,000 shares by the 20th
May as was confidently believed would have been
done had the usual facilities for transmitting
money existed.
Accordingly, and in response to a strong desire
from all quarters that a complete subscription
should be obtained, the Committee decided to
POSTPONE THE BALLOT and have now
determined to CONTINUE THE ISSUE OF
SHARES, being confident that immediately the
usual Banking facilities are restored, the required
number will be rapidly subscribed, when the list
will be at once closed and THE BALLOT PRO-
CEEDED WITH.
In accordance with the Rules of the Society the
Committee have decided that THE BALLOT
SHALL BE HELD BEFORE THE END OF
THE YEAR, but it is expected that the List will
be fully subscribed at a much earlier date, and the
Committee pledge themselves that no effort will
be spared to expedite the holding of the Ballot.
As previously advertised, UNDER NO CIR-
CUMSTANCES will the FIRST PRIZE (Bank-
ing Chambers, value <£30,000) be withdrawn.
Shareholders are particularly notified that the
whole of the Subscribed Funds were specially
secured against the Titles of the Properties form-
ing the Prizes, and are intact, being in no way
affected by Bank suspensions.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The new rules of the V.R.O. embody English
Jockey Club legislation against jockey proprietorship of
racehorses. Only those riders who train their own
animals are to be allowed to register colours, and sub rosa
purchasing of horses by jockeys will rank as a turf crime
—when found out. However, considering how quickly
secrets “get about” in the racing world, it should be
difficult for the mannikins to keep a stud it the V.R.O.
means real business. As for the rule forbidding jockeys
to bet—well, that will not make much difference.
Jockeys seldom bet in the first person, and the person
they do bet with can’t be compelled to “ split ’ on the
transactions, not by all the stewards on earth. The
proposal to arm stewards with the right to enquire into
“form” at a previous meeting, when it is strikingly
reversed under their august noses, will be welcomed by
the unfortunate public. But the point of this rule, as of
all others, must lie in the application of it. If puerile
“explanations ” are to be swallowed as readily as of yore,
the extension of stewards’ enquiry will produce nothing
more than a little extra ringing of the official bell and
more frequent delays before the “ all right ” flag is jerked
up to the top of the official pole. There is, anyway, a
promising appearance about the new code of racing
regulations for Victoria, although they don’t provide for
the ruthless execution of many turf notabilities who
ought to be hanged in the best interests of sport.
# # *
Likely enough, a good deal of money was won
by fancy wagerers who took odds about actually placing
the first three in the Epsom Derby. The winner was the
“dead bird,” and the two next best favourites followed
him home. But the horses that do this sort of thing don t
belong to Jew bookmakers or syndicates. Oh for a little
more Isinglass in Australian racing !
* » *
Sharp, the one-eyed Surrey bowler, didn’t figure
in last week’s match, and is seemingly a “goner.” The
trip to Australia with Lord Sheffield’s team, in which he
proved himself untrustworthy, settled the prospects of
Mr. Sharp.
• # *
Entries for the V.R.C. Grand National Steeple-
chase are not suggestive of a “good'open race,” and
already it looks like a case of the best of Miller’s starting
a strong favourite. For the G.N. Hurdle, however, there
are several well-known flyers on the list, so if some of
them, such as Pygmalion, have gone in seriously for the
jumping business, the smaller of the two big events should
be interesting.
# * *
The Brush Electric Engineering Co. are trying
to arrange a series of football matches on the Adelaide
Oval under the electric-light. This is awful! God sent
fourteen hours of dark in the winter so that Australia
might have some refuge from the football fiend.
* • *
The great aim of Adelaide cable-manipulators,
so far as the reports of the Australian cricketing tour in
England are concerned, is to boom the local members of
the team. The Advertiskr recently stated that all Lon-
don was excited over George Giflen’s batting, and that
England was paralysed with admiration at the prowess of
Lyons, while another Adelaide paper suggested that the
only reason for the frequent omission of Jarvis from the
playing eleven is that Blackham is jealous of him. It is
recognised that the public want to know about the four
South Australians, and if the man in London omits the
required intelligence, the scribe at this end supplies it.
• • •
Murdoch is- the missing word.
•' * *
The V.R.C. fulminates a rule against jocks
betting, or being part owners, except when trainers. How
about bookmakers owning horses?
* # #
The American papers now have the gall to talk
of “ the fight between an Australian named Hall and
Fitzsimmons, an American.” That is reminiscent of the
fact that Hanlan was a Canadian after Beach bested him.
• * *
On the Hall-Slavin “ match ” the Referee, of
April 23, wrote : “ If Slavin is beaten one may safely say
that all who saw the colonial box in previous matches
must be miserably bad judges of the art. Frankly, I
cannot see where Hall comes in at all, unless Slavin has
gone down-hill at break-neck pace.” The “unless ” came
in at the finish.
# * #
At the V.R.C.’s special meeting, last week, they
wouldn’t listen to any remarks about the cost of enter-
taining vice-royalty. The V.R.C., or any other racing club,
is nothing if not "loyal,” but Lord Hopetoun certainly
ought to give as much as he takes from the show that
rails off a lot of space for him and his party. Perhaps
Hopetoun does make an annual subscription. It so, it
had better be mentioned so as to dispel the prevailing
idea that his Excellency is a white elephant of consider-
able proportions.
Councillor James Garton, of Melbourne, who is
now in very bad health, 30 years ago swam from Sand-
ridge to Wiiliamstown—beating the Hellespont record.
* * *
Coningham annom«ed before leaving by the
Orizaba that he reckone'd’ to net £BOO by the English
tour. Something like £3*2 a week and all expenses paid 1
With Cohen as boss, the shekels are bound to be looked
after. By the way, the latter will come in for a fat share
of the “plunder,” and yet he draws £lO a week from
N.S.W. Lands Office during his leave of absence.
•# ’ *
That story about the poisoning of Slavin,
though probably untrue, is by no means impossible. It is a
notorious fact that Farnan, after beating Jackson, was
dosed in a way that destroyed his constitution and
shortened his days. Not many months ago the writer
saw a certain boxing-instructor enter the ring in a dazed
condition, to fall an easy prey to an inferior man. The
defeated man has since given up fighting in disgust,
because he has got evidence that he w'as dosed on the
occasion by his own second.
# • #
Dan O’Connor’s party are evidently lying low
for a good thing.
# * *
Larry Foley—and he ought to know—reckons
Jim Hall is tar and away a better man than Fitzsimmons.
Theoretically, perhaps, but Fitzsimmons takes care of
himself and Hall doesn’t.
» • •
Dear Bulletin, — Your readers may remember
how, over a year ago, I predicted that Jackson, on meet-
ing Slavin, would win, and “ win easily,” and afterwards
that when Slavin met “ a first-class heavy-weight as much
money may leave Australia as when Hanlan beat
Trickett?” Though doubted at the time, my words have
come true. Yet, I cannot claim any prescience. Anyone
studying Slavin’s career could feel he was never above
second-rate. Though he beat Dooley in 1887, I never saw
such a chopping-block as the unreliable Mick made of
him for the first ten rounds. When Slavin left
Sydney and all were calling him a cur, I had a
good word to say for him, yet could never
understand why Melbourne people made so much of him.
In Australia, Slavin did nothing wonderful. He never
actually beat Burke, as his barrackers say. In their first
contest Burke tried to knock him out in a limited number
of rounds, and didn’t; in their second, though the ring
was smaller, he, much bigger, did not knock out Burke
any more than Sullivan did Mitchell. He beat Costello
at Albury because the Buffalo could not act on grass. On
the boards, at the Alexandra, Martin proved the better
man. Yet Burke and Costello were beaten by middle-
weights like Creedon and Pritchard. The Farnan whom
Slavin beat was a wreck of his former self. 1 never be-
lieved in Slavin’s improvement in England. His association
with Baird and Mitchell could not improve his condition.
His great feats were beating Smith and Kilrain, like him-
self, mere newspaper champions.—Yours, &c., V.

People anxiously wait to see Cremorne’s weight
for Melb. Cup. After his easy Birthday Cup win he may
be up to anything.

Wanted—A Prophet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The office of prophet attached to the State
Has no one to fill it,
But where is the gifted one destined by Fate
To collar the billet?
A high monthly payment we offer in coin
To a truthful foreteller,
And unlimited fizz we would let him purloin
From the vice-regal cellar.
The duties are light—just to whisper the name
Of the next big race winner,
Or to tell us in time that the favourite’s lame,
Or his jockey a sinner.
To warn us what mornings we ought to takeout
Our best silken umbrella,
And apprise us when Broken Hill shares are about
To go back on a “feller.”
To give us the tip when our friends will come round
To go through us at euchre—
To disclose, ere it breaks, that the bank is unsound
Where reposeth our lucre.
To advise on investments, how far we should go
On stock or debenture,
To tell us what temper our best girl will show
If on marriage we venture.
To predict what ideas will take with the crowd
At the next big election,
So that we as good voters may all shout aloud
For Freetrade or Protection.
We do not demand, with the prophetic soul,
A too virtuous body,
But our seer must not be, if he essays the role,
The purveyor of shoddy.
He need not, in stature, be six feet in his socks,
Nor in presence be regal,
Nor need he look out from beneath his grey locks
With an eye like an eagle.
He need not be free with his tongue or his pen
As both you and I are,
But on one point he must be unlike other men—
He must not be a liar.

The Indian Empire has grown in size 100

Gavan Duffy mentions that, visiting strait-
laced Geneva lately, the home of Sabbatarian
Calvin, he was surprised to find the Parliamentary
election proceeding on Sunday, with the poll
taken in a church.
A British Royal Commission not long ago
reported that the British standing army was
mainly composed of weakly boys, while the
Reserve existed largely on paper only. Some
recent North London prosecutions for fraudulent
enlistment prod need am pie evidence that a favourite
game of militiamen is to enlist over and over
again—at 30s. a head bounty for each enlistment
in different battalions, while thousands of Army
Reserve men are also counted a second and even
third time as militiamen. If all branches were
mustered simultaneously, the British Army would
only number about 40 per cent, of its “paper ”
strength.

CONGRATULATIONS.
SUPREME

Having frequently heard and read of the Wonderful Cures effected by your World-wide Celebrated and Wonderful HERBAL ALFALINE REMEDIES for the
BLOOD; NERVES, &c,, I take the liberty of writing you a few lines by way of congratulation and encouragement. Ido so because I consider that a gentleman who
devotes his time and talents to the benefit of his fellow creatures is deserving of everyone’s esteem and regard—in fact, he ought to be looked upon in the light of a public
benefactor. The testimonials in the public press; and the expressions of satisfaction and gratitude of those who have benefited by your advice and remedies, are a suffi-
cient guarantee of your ability and honesty of purpose in your claims for the great virtues your remedies contain. The many favourable opinions promulgated by the press
concerning the noble mission of diminishing the pain and suffering of your fellow creatures must be to you a source of satisfaction and gratification. The very fact of your
having the Parisian Academy’s GOLD MEDAL and DIPLOMA of HONOR entitles you to universal respect and approbation. I am, dear sir, with all earnestness of
opinion that a pound or two invested in the purchase of your Wonderful ALE ALINE REMEDIES will be better invested and return better interest than if invested or
deposited in some of our present-day banking concerns, each Remedy of yours may be justly termed a BANK of HEALTH. —I am, dear sir, yours truly, E. BALY.

Frank Clark is billed for Billy Speed’s Gaiety ben. Not
often thus with rival managers.
“ Morocco Bound” is a sort of Gaiety burlesque, at the
London Shaftesbury, with the ballet in half-calf.
The latest: Antoinette Sterling is rather a ferocious-
looking woman, of the Irving type.
A Melbourne theatrical correspondent to Tub Bulletin :
" Tapley, the new tenor, has a light, sweet, tuneful
voice, marred somewhat by a vibrato suggestive at its
worst of a boozer trying to carry a mould of jelly. It
reminds one of Hatton without the power. He is the
nearest approach to a really fetching tenor the firm has
had for a long time. The new man will not be a masher
or a society favourite, as he is comparatively weak in the
legs; the Fat Man’s wives and daughters liking ’em—
well, otherwise.”
As an object-lesson to the visitor to our shores and the
youth of our cities the production of “Never Too Late to
Mend," at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, ought to be highly
educational. “In a lovely dell at the foot of a mountain,
with tree-ferns, waterfalls, and semi-tropic vegetation,"
are camped a tribe of aborigines, who, we are informed,
are denizens of the spinifex desert. The last time we
were in the spinifex desert that was just the appearance
it presented, only there were also groves of oranges,
bananas and grape vines—and free lunches. When the
niggers all sung out br-r-r-r-ah I we remembered them at
once as old friends—from La Perouse.
A “spiritualistic ” controversy was opportunely started
in the Adelaide Register just as the Steens began their
season.
Madame Antoinette Sterling, when in Adelaide, went
down to Yatala stockade and sang to the spirits in prison,
and the syndicators who engaged her protested against the
breach of her agreement, which binds her only to warble
at their concerts. But the entrepreneurs didn’t lose any-
thing. The ladies and gentlemen in quod couldn’t have
taken tickets, anyhow.
“ Never Too Late to Mend” was the greatest success
known in the east of London. Chas. Reade finally won
his interminable-looking suit against Conquest, who had
to pay thousands of pounds, and yet came out the
pecuniary gainer by a long chalk. In the first case. Reade
was beaten by Conquest, who upheld his right to drama-
tise the novel, until Reade, by an afterthought, showed
that the novel was based on a play he wrote long ago.
called “Gold.”
Gourlay, Walton and Shine did w-ell in Adelaide with
the everlasti g “ Skipped.” In ages to come Johnny
Gourlay will be able to play Obadiah Dingle au nature*,
" hich doesn’t mean without clothes on, but without any
necessity for a sham bald head.
Snazelle’s invitation to the Rational Sunday Evening, at
Melb. Ope:a House: ‘ Working men, attend in your
thousands wdth your wives and families (but not children
in arms). In these times of depression and sorrow you
will find some solid comfort in listening to and seeing this
sacred and philosophical entertainment.” The advisa-
bleness of leaving “ baby” at home is obvious. The little
cherub is rarely in a sacred or philosophical mood.
Sunday nights at Melb. are booked, commencing with a
magic-lantern of the Ober-Ammergau Passion Play. Dr.
Summers is the entrepreneur, he who launched the
Rotunda Sunday concerts.
C. Penstone, known in Australia as an artist, is in New
\ork, U.S.A., sketching for Brooklyn Life and running a
monologue entertainment. He declares that New York
has plenty of work for any man w ith ideas, and is “ struck
on ’ Yankeeland, save w'hen it is feet deep in snow. He
proposes to revisit Australia after “ the autumn ” which
shows that he is not much Americanised yet.
George Leitch now intends to produce, in Sydney, “ A
Prodigal Son,” which drama he has successfully hazarded
jn various Australian towns.
Good theatrical artists who have never visited Aus-
tralia—lrving, Tree, the Kendals, the Bancrofts, Hare
Wyndham, Alexander, Forbes Robertson, Willard Amy
Roselle, Ellen Terry, Julia Neilson, Kate Rorke, and Miss
Jessie Mill ward.
Jessie Millward is apparently destined to succeed the
soft, clinging Ellen Terry at London Lyceum. They are
to play three nights a week each at present. The begin-
ning of the end. But how long will Irving last, especially
after the almost certain knight-bachelorship ?

Dear Bulletin, — I have always understood that Wallace
composed “ Maritana” at New Norfolk (Tas.) You favour
Parramatta, and I daresay a Queenslander would back
Humpybong as the birthplace of the opera. Mel-
bourneites probably pin their faith to Brighton as the
spot where the inspired musician ground out his
melodies, while South Australia would hold up the wave-
washed shores of Glenelg. As for me, I will lay my money
on New Norfolk.— Van Demon.

Dear Bulletin, — -Now and then a communication ap-
pears to the effect that Pattie Browne owes her present
position to tutors—in other words, that she is nothing
better than a parrot. This is probably the outcome of
jealousy. In ’B2 or ’B3 the Lotos Amateur Dramatic Co.
gaie Our Boys in Sydney Academy of Music (now
Tivoli). I was Mary Melrose ; and the Belinda of the cast
was 1 attie—the first part she had ever played. The
unconventional reading she gave, and the talent she dis-
played, without a stage-manager to drum the part into
her head, surprised everyone. The audience insisted on
giving Belinda a special call. That Pattie Browne has
achieved a position and made a success in London, no one
can deny; why grudge the girl the kudos due to her
achievement? She had gained her laurels by energy
application and great talent. Long before Mr. Boucicault
or Mr. Beck came to this country, she made one of her
great successes as Lord Johnnie, in the “ Merry Duchess ”
under the management of Messrs. Williamson, Garner,
and Musgrove.—Yours, Myra Kemble.

W. J. Montgomery, the lad who played “juveniles”
with Miln in Australia, has married Grace Hawthorne the
American actress, at Manchester. He is a member of’ the
company of which she is star.
Geo. Wood was delivering a liquor lecture at Sydney
Tivoli the other evening, when two men rose in the front
row of the stalls to go out. Seizing the chance, Wood
said: Ah ! a case in point: you would not have needed
to leave had you brought two bottles in with you.”

Alf. Lawton and Clara Spencer dig up memories of Joe
Emmett and his wonderful voice with their “Dutch

Remembering the beautifully measured periods the
admirable enunciation and dignity of Charles Hall’s par-
son in “Man to Man,” it’seems a mistake that Rignold
did not place him as Chaplain Eden in “Never Too Late
to Mend.” But then he’d have no one to lift Levi a son,
of third-rate Shylock, out of the ruck. ’
One admires the sang froid of the Australian black-
fellow in George Rignold’s “Never Too Late to Mend ”
No stage-fright, no self-consciousness, not a look at the
audience. It takes the ordinary whitefellow years to for-
get the front of the house.
Wonder if Snazelle, who is scooping in the thalers with
his Sunday night shows at Melbourne Opera House
(winding up, ye gods, with “ Rock of Ages” in chorus ')
ever gives a grateful thought to ungodly Jos. Svmes who
fought for the privilege of Sunday entertainments “’with
collections ” with mind and money, and won it for all
and sundry.
Sunday shows go ahead in Melbourne. Three billed for
last Sunday: “Passion Play” at the Royal, Snazelle at
the Alhambra, and the usual at the Rotunda.
Cabled that some “ladies of the Gaiety Burlesque Co. ”
along with the unspeakably dreary Lonnen and several
others, raided the office of a Dunedin (M.L.) paper the
other day, and unsuccessfully demanded satisfaction for
certain aspersions on the character of the members of the
00. Five cf the chorus-girls then started to belabour the
editor and printer with horsewhips, but were thrown out
Regaining admission, they completely wrecked the in'
terior of the building. The most gladsome feature in the
story is that the depressing Lonnen got a bad thump on
the right eye. Australia wait* anxiously to know what
the paper said about the characters of the Gaiety ladies fo
rouse them to such fury. It is utterly impossible that it
could have reflected in any way on their morality ; and,
in any case, had ic done so, the knowledge of their own
obvious rectitude would have assuredly led them to treat
the accusations of a blackguard with disdain. After
mature consideration, Tins Bulletin is inclined to think
that the editor-man probably aggravated them on some
abstruse theological point.
Paragraphs appear describing Clement Scott’s wedding
at ’Frisco, and how his fiancee came from London “ under
the escort of his friend Austin Brereton ’’—husband of
Edith Bland. Dangerous system, this. All the girls we
have seen escorted altar-wards by the other fellow, have,
ere they had been a week at sea,'been, as it were, hugger!
by proxy, mugged by deputy, and embraced under power
of attorney.
According to the most favourable reading
of present indications, N.S.W. revenue will be
nearly £BOO,OOO less than last year.
The drivers employed by a Sydney “ pri-
vate enterprise ” ’busman have gone out on strike.
Summarised, the position is this: The kindly
employer (he must live, you know) wants the men,to
work over twelve hours daily for 30s. a week nett.
The remedy for this brutal' state of things—the
raunicipalisation of public vehicles.
As anticipated, the splitting-up of the
Democratic vote has lost the Labour-party the
N. Melbourne seat in the Victorian Parliament,
the Tory man, Reynolds, polling all his crowd
and coming out on top with 801 ; old drivel-by-
the-hour Laurens, 673 ; Prendergast, 670 ; Willie
Gaunson (as usual), 29.
Parkes addressed a Newcastle (N.S.W.)
meeting, the other evening. His bleached halo
saved him from a bad reception. The audience
cheered his hair. His appearance on the stage
was held in the theatre—was not im-
posing ; he looked as if he had existed somewhere,
a long time ago, and once had a meaning, but
was now an obsolete word in the human dictionary.
The speech, which was full of Parkes in various
aspects, was chiefly remarkable for the entire
absence of promises—there were no P.N.’s on the
future which, next to his hair, form Parkes’s
chief asset.
According to the books of the Registrar of
Shipping, Sydney, on 22nd May bills of sale passed
from the former joint-owners,of the barque Royal
Tar to Walter William Head, one of the promoters
of the “New Australia ” movement to nlant a co-
operative garden in the howling wildernesses of
Paraguay, South America. Walter William
Head purchased the Royal Tar for £1620
on 22nd May, and on 23rd May executed
a mortgage of that vessel for £2520 to “Wil-
liam Lane, gentleman ’’—formerly described,
by the way, as William Lane, journalist.
So far as we know, this much-abused term
“gentleman” has a narrow legal meaning, and,
as a mortgage is a legal document, that narrow
meaning must be here taken to apply. If we
understand aright, the legal meaning of “gentle-
man is a man who is not under the necessity
of earning his living any more, but is provided
for the rest of his life. This does not seam to
coincide with the popular idea of Moses Lane,
who is ever seen, “in the mind’s-eye, Horatio,”
battling with the stubborn wilds of South
America, belting down the giants of the Para-
guayan scrub, drilling terrible tunnels through the
adamantine Andes (or the nearest razorback
ridge), and generally warring with the elements.

When Labour shall be Free!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
O brother discontented —in the outer darkness
Secure in naught save sorrow, all faint-hearted
in your creed ; .
Believing nothing surely—at the best but vaguely
hoping ;
Basely passive in your bondage— -blindly waiting
to be freed.
To whom, fool, are you looking ? Think you, he
will liberate you, ,
He, your owner, pow’rful in his paltry pride ot
pilfered pelf; ,
Despising you, his servile slave, too much to roar
or hate you,
Do you look to him to free you ? Can you so
delude yourself ?
Or do you seek a saviour in the placid politician
Who reckons men and measures but as counters
in the game ,
Of personal self-inter’st, of ignoble self-ambition .
Who, Judas-like, would sell you to your ever-
lasting shame ?
Will you never learn your lesson ? Shall successive
ages find you
Still battling for your life’s-breath in the grasp
of griping greed ?
In the future, as in past time, shall your selfish
passions blind you
To your duty towards your fellow, to the teach-
ings of your creed ?
Who hath sold you into bondage? Who hath
forged the chain around you ?
Who condemned your helpless children to a
heritage of shame ?
Do you ever, fool, consider, whilst you curse the
fates that hound you ?
Ever strive to solve this problem e’er you seek to
cast the blame ?
Do you hold yourself as guiltless? Say, how
dealt you with your brother
In that day when Labour fought those bitter
battles for her life ?
Did you join the rush for places, caring nothing
that another
Might starve to fill your belly? Were you
traitor in the strife.
Lo, the truth is demonstrated ! Know you now
the dread despoiler?
Awake, and grasp the fact, man, —aye, and
profit by it, too ;
One enemy has Labour— only one —the traitor-
toiler,
Th’ Judas that betrayed her! Say, who was
this Judas? You?
Come, deal no more in abstracts, seeking some
abtruse solution,
The way is clear before you, if you only choose
to see;
When th’ toilers stand united —not in bloody
revolution—
But steadfast in one common cause: then
Labour shall be free.

The Bulletin has more than once referred
to the longest continuous speech on record, deli-
vered long ago in the British Columbian Legisla-
ture. It now clips an account of that marvellous
performance :
The measure before the House would, if passed, have
deprived many settlers of their lands. Member De Cosmos
was in a hopeless minority—he stood alone. The job had
been held back till the eve of the close of the session;
unless Legislation was taken before noon of a given day,
the act of confiscation would fail. The day before the
expiration of the limitation De Cosmos got the floor about
10 a.m., and began a speech against the bill. Its friends
cared little, for they supposed that by one or two o’clock
he would be through, and the bill could be put on its pas-
sage. One o’clock came, and De Cosmos was speaking
still-had not more than entered upon his subject. Two
o’clock—he was saying “in the second place.” Three
o’clock—he produced a fearful bundle of evidence and
insisted on reading it. The majority began to have a sus-
picion of the truth—he was going to speak till next noon
and kill the bill. For a while they made merry over it,
hut, as it came on to dusk, they began to get alarmed.
They tried interruptions, but soon abandoned them, be-
cause each one afforded him a chance to digress and gain
time. They tried to shout him down, but that gave him
a breathing-space, and, finally, they settled down to
watch the combat between strength of will and weakness
of body. They gave him no mercy—no adjournment for
dinner, no chance to do more than wet his lips with
water, no wandering from his subject, no sitting down.
Twilight darkened ; the gas was lit; members slipped out
to dinner in relays, and returned to sleep in squads, but
De Cosmos went on. The Speaker, to whom he was
addressing himself, was alternately dozing, snoring, and
trying to look wide-awake. Day dawned, and the
majority slipped out in squads to wash and breakfast,
and the speaker still held on. It cannot be said that it
was a very logical, eloquent, or sustained speech. There
were digressions in it, repetitions also. But still the
speaker kept on ; and at last noon came to a baffled
majority, livid with rage and impotence, and a single
man who was triumphant, though his voice had sunk to
a husky whisper, his eyes were almost shut and were
bleared and bloodshot, ’ his legs tottered under him, his
blacked lips were cracked and smeared with blood. De
Cosmos had spoken twenty-six hours, and saved the
settlers their lands!

THE SECRETS OE SUCCESS.
Mr. J. B. Warbrick, or “Joe Warbrick,” as In
is familiarly known, was captain of the New
Zealand Native Football Team (better known as
“The Maoris’’), which visited the Old Country
and gave such a good account of itself during tha
season there of 1888-81). This team firmly believed
that St. Jacobs Oil is one of the secrets of success
in football, and kept itself in prime condition by a
free use of it. The'team was so unanimous in its
verdict that the matter is worthy of special men-
tion. Mr. Warbrick, in conversation with one ol
the representatives of the Chas. A. Vogeler Co.,
I in Sydney, after their return, stated : “ I hava
much pleasure in testifying to the efficacy of St,
Jacobs Oil. I have used it constantly since my
first visit to New South Wales in 1884, having
then injured my knee in our first match ; and dur-
ing our tour in Great Britain we have used noth-
ing else, and the New Zealand Native Football
Team all speak in the highest terms of its

letter, in which he states : “ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the wonderful properties of St.

The Curse of Smith, Senior
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He was French master in a big boys’ boarding-
school near Sydney. His business there was to
teach 35 medium-sized boys how to inquire daily
in Paris French :
“ Have you seen the hat of the gardener’s (/) uncle ?”
And how to answer Jesuitioally :
“ I have eaten the father’s meat, and thou hast given
Louise some pens and some paper.”
Then there were 15 or 20 smaller boys who were
expected to be well-grounded in such assurances
as, “My father is good. My mother is good. I
have a good brother, and I have also a good
sister.”
Lastly—and in the superlative degree of worse-
ness—there were the seven boys of the top class
whom Antoine escorted daily through the ways
and wiles of Telemachus.
He hated it. He loathed it all. Day after day
he would leave the school —his Ahn, and his
Grammaire, and his Telemaque beneath his arm
—muttering:
“ I vill go back no more. Nevaire. Zere is an
end to all zing.” But next day lie would be there
again, telling Jones sadly that a father could not
be “bonne,” and explaining pathetically to Smith,
senior that:
“ Viz ze verrb to be,
Ze pass partceeple mosst agree,
In gendaire, nombaire and person, ziz ze sob-
jeck.”
Smith, senior, was a white-haired boy, with a
big head and a small and sweet-looking face. He
had a pretty mouth and a generally angelic ex-
pression. It hjud struck Antoine once or twice
that Smith, senior, always looked more particu-
larly angelic when he was feeling and being most
particularly demonish.
One day Smith, senior, gave the first turn to the
resolution of Antoine's life-wheel.
It was a close, sultry day, and hot beyond
description. And it was half-past two in the
afternoon, an hour when all boys in all schools,
and all masters, too, for that matter, begin to
suspect that the big hand goes as slowly as the
little one, and that the slowness of both is more
than mortal man was meant to endure.
Antoine was about to give the medium boys
dictation.
“ Get your slites,” he said.
“ What for?” said twenty voices eagerly,
“S-s-sh,” said Antoine. “ Wonn moment, and
I veel tell you. Now, are you all ready?”
He cleared his throat, and announced: “Ze
Dictoition Examinoition.”
“ Bully,” said Smith, senior, sotto voce. He was
good at spelling. “Fire away.”
“ I vill read ze Englees firrst and zen ze
Froinch,’ said Antoine. “ Are you ready ? ”
They were ready, so he began : “ Ze two soldaire
were ready. Ze eldaire haf hees gun, and ze
youngaire hees sword. Zey begin to fight; soon
ze youngaire keels ze eldaire, who vas hees oncle.
Zen he deeps hees sword in ze blod of hees skin”—
This struck Smith as curious.
“The blood of what ? ” he said.
“ Ze blod of hees skin,” said Antoine slowly.
“ Blood of his skin? ”
“Ze—blod —of—bees skin.’
“Jove, that’s rum. Show us the book, Tony.”
“No, saire,” said Antoine. “You will be
silent. My plice ’ere ees to teach you. Your
plice ees to listen, and be good boy.”
He went on with his reading. Suddenly he
was interrupted with a great burst of uproarious
laughter from a boy in the back seat. He looked
up. It was Smith, senior. He had a book in his
hands—it was another copy of the book Antoine
was reading from, and he had turned the leaves
and found the place, and tried to discover for
himself that mysterious “blood of his skin.”
“ Ha, ha, ha,” he roared.
“Silence, said Antoine, amazedly.
. But Smith laughed on, and the boy next him
f “ T ’ the - bo ° k ’ aud
he began to Hugh too.
Vat you laugh ? said Antoine angrily.

Then a n the boys, big and little, seeing the

off the shelf behind him, gathered Ahn and Gram-

The boys stopped laughing presently, and didnt
think it worth while to explain to the amazed

disappearance.

He was caned, of course, and felt better for it.
But Tony, as he called him, had always been a
favourite of Smiths, despite the verb to be and

and ’fc. was a long, tong time before he ceased to
feel himself to blame for Ton y s mysterious dis-
appearance.

Chapter 11.
Smith, senior, grew up, and became what you
would call a man. He was a trifle longer than of
yore. His hair had turned a good many shades
darker. A moustache hid the mouth that had
been so angel-like, and, to Tony, so demon-like in
his boyhood. He was a law-student now. He
was just beginning to mingle in his conversation
with his sisters little legal catches, such as
“advise,” and “without prejudice,” and several
other bywords of the bar.
Already his mother had seen him a Q.O.
Since the days of Tony he had learnt a good
deal of French, but had forgotten it all ages ago.
Now, he took pleasure and pride in avowing his
ignorance of such a language, which is a little way
young graduates have —I have often noticed it.
One morning—he had been to a ball up the river
the night before—ho came into town an hour
earlier than usual. It was the fault of the boat-
system. He had either to be half-an-hour late, or
a good hour early, and he chose the latter, as the
time for the LL.B. exam, was drawing uncom-
fortably near, and the lecture-market had gone up
in value accordingly.
“While I’m waiting,” he said, “I’ll get a
shave.”
Then he remembered that upstairs in the arcade
he was going through at that very moment there
was a barber that a friend had recommended to
him highly only yesterday.
So up the stairs he ran and along the passages.
It was early, hardly eight o’clock, and there were
few people about.
Presently his eye caught sight of the legend on
the glass of a window. “ Hairdresser, Barber and
Dermatologist,” and a little higher up the pane,
“ Antoine Turan.”
He knew the name at once, but for a moment he
forgot just exactly who Antoine Turan was.
Then—ah !he remembered, of course, and, with a
rush, Tony came back among a crowd of remini-
scences, and Smith went in.
Inside there was a little, brown-faced and black-
haired man, with bright and kind-looking brown
eyes, and the moustache and hair-parting of his
profession. He wore a light suit of black alpaca,
and a fresh white apron was tied around his waist,
but for the rest, saving that his coat-sleeves were
black now and not green as of yore, and that the
great hollows beneath his once sad eyes were now
filled in with goodly brown flesh, he was just the
same old Tony who had years ago met a “lyrikin.”
There was the odour of pomatum around him
indeed, but then, that had been around him since
the days of his long-clothed babyhood.
“Hullo!” said Smith. “By jovel It’s you,
Tony 1”
“Eet ees,” said Tony, beaming. “Ees it a
shive zat you vill require,” eyeing him profession-
ally.
“ Yes,” said Smith, “bub you don’t remember
me?”
“Pardon, monsieur, no. I—pardon. Zereis
so many zat I see. But I know ze face some’ow.”
Smith sat down, and Tony got his things ready.
“I say,” said Smith, “do you remember a kid
at old Martin’s school named Smith ? You taught
him French.”
“ Hees hair vas vat colair-e ? ” said Tony.
“ White,” replied Smith.
“Zat vas Smee, senieur,”said Tony, who had
long ago forgiven, though he had never forgotten
him.”
“ And that’s me, Tony.”
“ Eet ees you, monsieur. Non-sense. Ah ! So.
Yes, eet ees you, Meestaire Smee.”
“Jove, I was surprised to see you, Tony,” said
Smith. “I thought you’d really vanished this
life years ago.”
“Vat? Zat I vas dead. Oh, no. I am just
marry.”
“You are? My compliments to Mrs. Tony,
and good luck to you both,” said Smith.
“1 haf had ze good luck at larst,” said Tonv
“ but eet took long in coming. Eet vas a legace—
legacie, zat got me ’ere. Mon onole he leaved it
to me, and I giff up ze teach for evaire. Ah, ze
teach. I did hite it.”
Then he began to shave.
“Ah,” lie said, “zereis a grate develment in
you now.”
Smith couldn't speak, but he gasped an “Eh 1”
“ Yes, zere ees. Grate develment, vat you call
devel-op-ment,.growf in you.”
Anything funny could always tickle Smith. He
had not put on, with his moustache, the blind-
eyed and deaf-eared imperviousness to jokes that
so many a moustache affects.
As Tony’s voice said “develment” in the old,
old way, the words—“He deeped ins sword in the
blod of hees skin ” came rushing back to him. He
saw it all: Tony, angry and excited, his English
becoming more barbarously broken with his
broken temper; himself, little, white-haired Smith,
in agonies of a merciless laughter; the boys all
more or less ditto, and the reminiscence was too
much. He gave a laugh. His head lurched.
Somehow the razor slipped very badly, and then
—and then—
Smith, senior, lay with white, still face upon
the floor. Blood was on the razor, and on him.
Tony knelt beside him. He had tied his hand-
kerchief, and Smith’s, and several cloths, round
the wounded throat. “He felt Smith’s hands,
and face, and found them cold. He wrung
his hands, and tore his hair, and felt his tears
sting hot and thick upon his cheeks.”
“ Mon Dieu !” he cried. “He ees dead, and I
—l—’tis I haf kill him !”
It was early, and few people were about.
Tony shut his door behind him, and went
hastily downstairs.
There was a little, three-roomed house at Pad-
dington, and she, little, grey-eyed Lisa, she was
there. He thought of her all the time, as he ran
along, bare-headed, and jumped into the nearest
cab. He thought of her all the way home, and
the horse’s hoofs seemed to trot to the tune of
“Lisa, Lisa.”
“Mon Dieu !” he moaned, “ zis is too hard, zis
is too grite. All my life haf I served, if not for
ze, zen nevaire against ze. All my life. But all
zings go against me. Ah, ah. It was alwy Smee,
senieur.”
In ten minutes he was home. Lisa heard him
coming, and, opening the door, was there to meet
him. He drew her in and shut the door, and,
seating her on a chair, knelt on the floor beside
her and put his arms around her.
“Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa !” he moaned.
“ Tony, dearest mine, why do you cry?” she
said, affrightedly.
“ I haf kill a man,” he said,
“Thou, my Tony! Antoine, thou! Ah no.”
She held his head close against her heart, and laid
herlittJe, soft, brown hands upon his face. She
hardly understood, but saw that something dread-
ful had happened.
“It has alwise been Smee, senieur.” said An-
toine, hopelessly.
Lisa knew all about Smith, senior. Had not

Re had a queer way of speaking. He had had
an accident a few years back. The man who had
all unwittingly been the cause of it was tending
grape-vines for a master at the foot of far-off
French mountains. #
Smith was sitting on his table talking to some

lt was true. Smith needn’t have felt apolo-
getic for the statement. But the others looked
doubtful. They had not yet aspired to chambers,
and encountered some little difficulty with the
Tenth Commandment. So they were dubious,
iust a little, but politely, for Smith’s chambers
were good recreation grounds at lunch times.

Emperor of Asia.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
According to the cable the Czar of Russia intends to
'adopt for himself the title of Emperor of Asia :
There is meaning in the music, in the wild, un-
couth refrain
Of the strong North’s rolling anthem in the hymn
of Tamerlane.
Have ye heard it, old-world leaders, as they roar
it from afar?
“Stand aside, the Slav is coming; long live
Russia and the Czar !”
From the bleak, bare hills of Asia, from the forest
of the fir,
They are marching for their Mother, they are
dying fast for her.
Have ye seen her, old-world prophets ? she is fresh
and fair and young,
And around the Tartar’s camp fire songs like this
are loudly sung :
“Men must die, and who for glory falls before the
foeman’s steel,
Half the sting of death escapeth, half her pain
will never feel;
Ours the world will be for taking, ours the gates
already are.
Stand aside! the Slav is coming; on for Russia
and the Czar!”
On the steppes of war-worn Asia, by the frozen
Arctic shore,
Tramp the legions of the Tartar, swelling hourly
more and more.
’Tis the same old tale repeated—Masters, set your
minds at ease.
Was not Rome, the aged, conquered by a people
such as these ?
Did the oW-blood turn to water in the dusk of
ages gone,
When the new- blood surged and thundered round
the gates of Babylon ?
Did the Persian melt before him when the tur-
baned heathen came
With his prophet and his Allah and the scimitar
and flame?
Do ye know it, old-world students, that they
marry to beget —
That the vice we dare not mention has not reached
the Tartar yet ?
Have ye noticed, old-world sages, how this new-
blood, strong as wine,
Surges like the mountain torrent ’cross the
Danube and the Rhine ?
Nations rise, and empires flourish, flourish grandly
to a fall,
And the victor lives to vanish, so ’tis written—
that is all !
Masters, are your cannon ready ? you may need
them very soon,
When the world is set a-dancing to some merry
Tartar tune.
Ivan, keep your rifle loaded and remember what
you are;

and the Czar J ”

Joe Beef’s Canteen, at Montreal, Canada,
is a weird memory of the past. The Salvation
Army reports that the place was recently “cap-
tured,” and will be fitted up as a food and shelter
dep6t—which, by the way, it,ever has been. It
is not stated that the Army captured Joe Beef
personally, but the “ despatch ” leads one to sup-
pose that Joseph has either died or retired from
business. Anyway, the Canteen, as the present
writer knew it ten years ago, will nevermore shelter
a buffalo in the “loose” box adjoining the great
bar room, nor reverberate with the roaring of
grizzly bears, from their cages and hiding-places
about the premises. The famous skeleton of Joe
Beef’s father, that used to stand in tattered regi-
mentals, with one bony finger on the bar, grinning
an eternal welcome upon frowsy lodgers and dis-
tinguished visitors alike {we were a distinguished
visitor), has gone for good. In the old times, one
was expected to shout a drink for the skeleton, as
a matter of courtesy to the host’s family, and
many a ten-cent piece did “ Bones ” thus yield to
the till. And the crazy piano at the far end of
the spacious, low-roofed room has probably dis-
appeared along with the anatomical specimen,
and the bears and monkeys, and the buffalo whose
tameness and love of “play” were such that he
used to career around his ptivate apartment like
an earthquake whenever you looked in to see him.
Only those who have gazed upon Joe Beef’s bar-
room piano can understand the depth of degrada-
tion to which a box of music may descend. There
was scarcely a suspicion of ivory left upon the
keys of the jingling instrument. The dirt
of many years had settled in its constitution, and
the name of its maker was indiscernible for
grease. In our mind’s eye we can picture Joe
Beef’s eldest son, a lad of 13 or so, at that time,
standing beside this same piano and singing, to
the accompaniment of a poor, wasted, consumptive
wretch, the popular ditty of the doss-house.
’Twas a long, descriptive songof many verses, and
the ad vantages offered to lodgers were explained
in the chorus :
There’s one cent for korfee,
And one cent for bread ; m
There’s three fora beefsteak,
And live for a lied,
And a breeze from the gutter—
A nice healthy smell
To refresh all the boys
At the Bummers’ Hotel.
Joe Beef acted religiously up to the terms of this
chorus. Vagrants coming into the Canteen in the
evening could cut their own steaks off the divided
carcase of a bullock, select half a loaf from a huge
cupboard full of them, and take their meal up-
stairs to be prepared by the cook. From a copper
in the middle of her “ kitchen ” the cook ladled
out a tin bowl of soup as a first course, and by the
time a man had “done” his soup, steak
and half loaf, and pannikin of korfee from
another copper, he was well filled for his five cents.
Then, if he liked, lie could turn at once into one
of the couple of hundred beds laid on the floors of
the neighbouring dormitories, and sleep till six in
the morning. At six o’clock Joe Beef struck a
gong, and his lodgers had to quit the show for the
day. The gong was the signal to get out. If they
were too tired or too drunk to wake up, Joe and
his henchman chucked them out promiscuously.
Sometimes it happened that a lodger was maimed,
or perhaps killed right away, by the chucking, but
this made no difference to anybody but the victim.
Joe Beef reigned as king of the waifs and strays of
Montreal, and he had a policeman’s license to
commit any small accidents of the kind. He was
more than a provider of beds and banquets at five
cents a head. He was the father of the destitute*
inasmuch as he allowed his wretched customers
unlimited “ tick,” if necessary. They could always
fly from starvation to the Bummers’ Hotel* pro-
vided that they made a decent pretence
of looking for work. Joe pitched them
forth at 6 a.m. in order that they might
make an early start in quest of a job*
The Harmy can change the old ramshackle Cart :
teen into a Food and Shelter Depot, but it will
never do any better for the outcasts of Montreal
than Joe Beef did for them. The Harmy may
tone down the colour of the language used in the
establishment, but at the same time it is tolerably
certain to tone down the dimensions of the steaks.
Any introduction of prayer amongst the “bum-
mers ” will not compensate for the loss of the big
brown bear that used to ruminate in a deep hole
under the kitchen, almost immediately below the
soup-copper. Joe had a rough-and-ready way of
converting a real hard case by opening the trap-
door of this hole and threatening to drop the
sinner upon the beast of prey. Moreover, the
influence of Joe’s wild philanthropy made itself
felt in the place, and was as much Christian reli-
gion as any poor devil could require—especially
after the snow had commenced to fall and sleighs
were running on the frozen St. Lawrence River
hard by. The writer, having the recollection of a
riotous night at Joe Beef’s engraved upon his
heart, begs to express his regret that General
Booth is the new landlord of this charitable insti-
tution. He will alter it out of knowledge, and
stop the supply of strong drink. Instead of “ One
cent for korfee and one cent for bread,” &c., they
will sing hymns and weary the lodgers with exhor-
tations to prepare for death Just as if there
oiuld be a more simple and practical reminder of
the future state than Joe Beef’s father’s skeleton.

Bensons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For

Buchn Bitters,
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retentioh or Inconvenience of tlrine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidheys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in Oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB-I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeits a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsins Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagtie.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depi’essed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
p eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.
EDWARD ROW & CO.,

A Protest.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A Melbourne journal reprints from a London organ a
paragraph, to the effect that, on a recent evening, the
Prince of Wales was seen to stop in the street and buy a
penny box of matches from an old man. And, gushingly
adds the paper, “ he paid for it.”
We have read with bilious vapours feeble bunkum
in the papers, the vilest kind of pappycock
that fires the wrath of men,
And we wish to say we’re weary of the stories
dull and dreary, with a weariness and loathing
far beyond our power to pen.
'Tis the paragraph infernal in the loyal local
journal, or the greasy rag devoted to “society”
affairs,
Re the prince who gave a tanner, in a condescend-
ing manner, to a kiddy on the highway, now
at which our soul despairs.
Again we feel our stomach turning when we meet
a par. concerning His Highness Albert
Edward and his pleasant, simple way,
Showing how he spoke benignly to a pauper or
divinely shed a smile upon an orphan, like a
man of couimyp clay.
When we read the Czar of Russia is a fatherly old
brusher—that he’ll push the p’rambulator, or
hold baby for a spell,
Or he’ll do a bovine gambol with the children, or
a ramble in the Woods to gather mushrooms —
We feel horribly unwell.
Then we’re moved to fits of madness by that
loathly chirp of gladness re some beauteous
British princess bathed in sympathetic tears,
Or her kindness to the peasants in accepting little
presents whilst a wretched crowd stand ’round
her and give idiotic cheers.
Much we hate that wayworn fable that they send
along per cable, informing us Her Gracious
heaves a sympathetic sigh
When she hears of inundations overwhelming
towns and stations—especially as we’ve always
got to settle for the lie.
We would slay the liar hoary, who concocts that
dreadful story of the stranger whom he meets
with, who is nice as anything,
Who is fairly level-pated and not badly educated,
and yet turns nut (wild amazement!) to be so-
and-so, the king.
Save ns from the tale of Tummy, to a drummer
bland and chummy, of the duke who carried
parcels, and who wasn’t proud or vain ;
Of his earlship, simple-minded, who once led a
beggar blinded o’er a crossing, or the noble
lord who “dresses very plain !”
There’s insanity quiescent in the man whom these
incessant debilitating items moves to raptures,
and who then
“ Loyal ” sentiments evinces, having learnt that
kings and princes, and dukes and earls, and
such like, on occasion act like men.
SILAS SNELL.
“Yon study three weeks, you love three
weeks, quarrel three years, suffer each other for
30 years, and your children go the same way.”—

Capfc. Reeves, of the P. and O. steamer,
Australia, which has made the record run out
from London, claims that his vessel can be
steamed “ comfortably ” nearly a knot an hour
faster than any other Australian liner afloat, “not
excepting the Britannia, whose average is about
15.6.”
Victoria Woodhull and her sister Claflin
opened the - fashionable American restaurants to
the unfettered patronage of woman, without male
attendants. The chief incident in this campaign
was their going to Delmonico’s, where admittance
was refused them. They took in the first man
out of the street, and treated him to a tiptop
dinner.
Dr. Youll was “all there” in the Melbourne
coroner’s chair, but once he struck a snag. Re-
calcitrant and bibulous juryman; “I objeck to
this sort thing! These other ’leven fellers are
only bloomin’ sticks—take all you shay for gospel!
Verdiek not worth a tinker’s damn !” Coroner,
with immense dignity : “Sir, if you come here to
sit on a jury you must conduct yourself in a
becoming manner.” “Come here? Dash it all, I
—hie—didn’t come here ! I was fetched here —
yanked along against my will by a—hie—copper!”
And Youll “gave him best.”
The other day English Labour-member
Keir Hardie, referring to his well-known flannel
collar, said his wife wished him to wear white
collars like other people, but he found dark flannel
ones more comfortable and convenient and less
costly. “ Like other people!” Here one sees the
beginning of a socio-political tragedy. Observe
the woman getting in the thin edge of the wedge
of Fashion that leadeth to Esq., a silk hat, broad-
cloth and—a title. Unhappy the woman whose
Labour-member husband will only wear a brown
flannel shirt and a tweed cap !
An Auckland (M.L.) man complains that
the law over there is altogether too incomprehen-
sible. He was employed by a small firm, and had
to sue for his wages, but the lawyer on the other
side demonstrated to of the Court
that he wasn’t an but a partner, and
therefore not entitled to wages, and the case was
dismissed with costs. Then he sued, as a partner,
for his share of the firm’s profits, and the same
lawyer got up and demonstrated to the satisfac-
tion of the same Court that he wasn’t a partner,
but only an and therefore not entitled to
profits, and the second case was dismissed with
costs. Last of all, he wrote to the Law Institute,
asking the opinion of that body as to whether the
lawyer in question wasn’t a liar, but so far he has
received no answer.

"THE BULLETIN.
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
«I*ix © 13 ulleti sx,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
Ths Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Crinr'nal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause,' and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of nationa
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clahns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital’ is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
tnat so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
♦ 'i?®,'Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
o the bus liman of the Far North, the stockman
Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
traits, and the digger in the Maori land
anges. A paper which is at once the most
Publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
nfSlu ascerta inable from any postal official—that,
lettw i ssue d i n Australasia, The Bul-
N ls , t' lo one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another,

LIFE IS SHORT!
SO VERY SHORT!
What a pity we cannot have a Lease of Life!
Townspeople require a trip—ruralise in the country. Country folk, on
the other hand, improve their health by a change of air—sea air, city air,
Sydtiey air—and such is life. Still, how much better to study one’s health,
and live so long as we can. One and all should make the best of this
planet. Even an occasional trip to Sydney does one a world of good, and
the cost is but a trifle. Now, good husband, if your wife be ill or unsettled,
send her straight away to Sydney. Probably, she will inquire to spend a
few pounds in house and family requisites, in little necessary articles men
never dream of, and should know naught about, merely simple little things
which all good women require to adorn and make home what a home should
be -a paradise of its kind. And, again, little nic-nacs—Boots, etc.—for
the children are wanted. Nice, tidy fashions to decorate your dear chicks,
and make them happy. Make your boys ambitious, iff a good plan. Your
son may some day hold Duffs or Dibbs’ position ; every boy has his chance
in this lottery of life.
We are now coming to business. I am FOY, good sir, and I vow to
you your wife will save surely Four Pounds in every outlay of Ten Pounds
in DRAPERY, BOOTS and SHOES, etc.- that is, by coming and dealing
with your humble servant, Foy. Foy is a little, fat, unpretentious haber-
dashery man a draper who is not proud, but truly loves his trade.
Foy never deceives or cheats. Foy feels most proud and contented
when the public praise his shop, his goods, his assistants, his prices, and
admire his endeavours to please. Say ! Foy is not a bad man.

MARK FOY’S.
A PROPHECY.
DON’T BE DISTRESSED. Depression will soon give place to prosperity by thoughtful economy
and good laws. The lands of the colony should be its source of wealth, but this can only be
practicable by a profitable market being provided for the products of the land. The railway rates
should be adapted, somewhat upon the Zone system, to the wants of the inland districts. By carrying
rates to the sea-board, so that the tillers of the soil may have a profitable market provided (America
owes her great prosperity mainly to this), emigration would then flow into the country, population
increase, and a natural boom the result.
