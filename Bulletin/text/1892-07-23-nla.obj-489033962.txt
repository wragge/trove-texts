If you wish to be comfortable in your mind as to your liability to INFLUENZA,
always keep a bottle of Bosisto’s “Parrot Brand” Eucalyptus Oil by you and
ready for immediate use by night or by day.
It is sl Germ Killer.
Sprinkle it on your pillow at night. Use it in a vaporiser—a few drops mixed
with water —and steam the apartment. INHALE THE STEAM if there be
Nasal Congestion or Throat Troubles.
Dr. BRENDON GURGENYEN, of Kensington, London, writes of the oil;
“ I have directed the spray to be used and oil sprinkled on the pillows at night, and I
am convinced I have saved many from the disease.”
BOSISTO’S “PARROT BRAND” EUCALYPTUS OIL.
To guard against having an inferior and unrefined oil served on them, buyers are
cautioned to examine the wrappers for the trade-mark (a parrot on a yellow band), and
on opening the package to see that the words “ J. Bosisto, Richmond,” are moulded
in large letters on the bottle. None other is genuine. Ask for

“ THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
Tlic Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tlx© Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal ,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
• cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
Ihe Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and - best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised. The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover Js equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the ihost
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
strnightfor—ard ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SATURDAY. JULY 23, 1892.
Prolonging' the Agony.
For many months past the “land banks "of
Australia have been smashing one by one
until now only a very few remain afloat on
the troubled sea of finance. Among those
which are gone there .is a melancholy same-
ness, and the story of one is practically that
of all. With about two exceptions the
twelve or twenty institutions that have
departed had not one shred of common
honesty among them all. They were
organised chiefly in order that the directors
might get money by lying and misrepre
sentation, and spend it in w ild eat mines
and race-horses, and champagne, and mis-
cellaneous females with yellow hail- and bogus
jewellery. They w ere got up, most of them,
that the same directors might buy land at a
low figure and sell it to their “ banks ”at six
times its value. Their business was to take
in the savings of the poor, and to beggar the
widow, and to clean out old men, imbeciles,
and cripples ; and not one, so far as we are
aware, made any serious attempt to lessen
the shock in any way to its miserable
victims. They were nearly all run by shin-
ing lights of the Church—by Christians of
high repute and good standing—and 19
Christians out of every 20 proved to be
unmitigated swindlers, without one human
sentiment in their callous souls and
unfeeling hearts. Among all the de-
ceased offices liardly one ever made a
serious effort to retrieve its position ;
they existed only to get in deposits, and as
the deposits came in they were scrambled for
by everybody from the managing-director
down to the office-boy, and when they ceased
to come in the establishments closed up in
peace. The balance-sheets were bogus from
first to last. The auditors, who, like the
directors, were mostly men of religious
tendencies, attested these balance-sheets
unanimously, and either it was that not one
among them all had intelligence enough to
discover that the office he represented was
utterly insolvent, or else they were all willing
to perjure themselves for a small considera-
tion. There is scarcely one bright spot in
the whole dreary record ; the history "f the
insolvent land-banks of Australia is a story
of bushranging and highway robbery from
beginning to end.
* # *
Also, there is the same dreary monotony
about the liquidators’ reports in almost every
instance. Every bank, when it suspended
payment, told the same tale about temporary
embarrassment, and a large surplus of assets,
and a copious reserve fund, and they all
promised that their depositors would be paid
in full, and that a large balance would
remain over for the shareholders. Then it
leaked out by slow degrees that the assets
wore dead men’s bills, and the unsecured
overdrafts of the directors’ relatives, and
fOl 's signed by persons who couldn’t be
found, and scrip in “gold mines” which
consisted of a hole in a desert and a
dead ass, and occasionally a £lO allotment on
a burnt ridge in the wilderness, w hich pur-
ported to be legally mortgaged for amounts
that varied up to £lOOO or more. There-
fore, the uncalled capital was resorted to,
and the shareholders proved to be partly
dummies and the rest ruined tradesmen and
the like, and the final results in three-fourths
of the institutions are—value of securities,
nil ; value of uncalled capital, nil ; alleged
reserve fund undiscoverable ; debts owing
to the bank, worth about one penny in the
alleged £*, and final dividend to the bank’s
innumerable creditors —a blank.

A few institutions, however, which would
otherwise have gone with the rest, were saved
by a peculiar legislative enactment passed
by the Munro Government in Victoria, and
foolishly copied by the Dibits Government in
New South Wales. This measure originated
with Premier Munro himself, and Munro
was in the banking business. He was
the creator and leading spirit of an institu-
tion which lias since gone to unutterable
w reck. He w as more or less responsible for
its balance-sheets, which appear to be worse
than dubious. Ho announced that his bank
was prosperous when beyond doubt it was
utterly ruined, and lie misrepresented its
financestothe extentseeminglyof £1,000,000,
and then, last of all, ho departed from the
wrath to come by appointing himself
Victoria’s ambassador in England at a
large salary, and left his beggared share-
holders to face the ruin without him. Being
abankerof this sort he introduced a Bill, which,
in the light of subsequent events, appears to
have been actuated by the same motives as
his balance-sheets, and was just as much
above suspicion as his bank, providing
that any financial institution could refuse
to pay its depositors, and still go on taking
deposits, and could stave oft’ its obligations
for three years, provided a certain number
of shareholders and creditors passed a
resolution to that eflect. And by doing this
it could also postpone an enquiry into the
nature of its securities, and an examination
of the dead men’s overdrafts, and the worth-
less I O U s, and the equally valueless scrip,
and the whole reckless system, whereby its
capital and the depositors’ funds had been
gambled away. It w'as, in short, a scheme
whereby the directors could have three
years more to patch the accounts, or to
bolt if the accounts were past that stage,
and all that time they xvere authorised to
take in and dissipate more money, and
thus make the ruin ten times worse than it
was before. The measure failed in some
degree, inasmuch as several of the most
pretentious “ banks ” came down with a run
all the same, but the scheme has kept alive
a good many moribund vampires which
would be much better dead.
* * *
Those banks which survived by virtue of
-Tames Musko’s device did so ostensibly
because a majority of the shareholders and
the depositors decided to “take advantage ”
of the Act. The said Act assumes that the
shareholders and depositors who voted to
that effect were real individuals, and not
myths got-up for the occasion. In other
words, it assumes that the shareholders’
register is absolutely true and reliable in an
institution where —to judge by a long ex-
perience of land-banks in general—every
other document is a fraud and a lie ; and
that, whereas nine-tenths of the directors
whose conduct has been investigated have
proved utter swindlers, therefore, the direc-
tor whose conduct has not been investigated
is strictly honest, and wouldn’t pack the
meeting with bogus depositors under any
conditions. Both these assumptions are
utterly unwarrantable. When a “bank”
suspends payment under present circum-
stances, the proceedings are a profound com-
mentary on the wisdom of two Australian
legislatures. Two meetings are called—one
of shareholders, and another of depositors
and debenture-holders. The principal direc
tor, or some other member of the board,
generally occupies the chair. The hall is
filled with individuals who may be genuine
shareholders, or who may be hired fur
tlie occasion, and armed with scrip or
deposit-receipts, which were served out
for this especial purpose only. The
chairman, as a rule, is sole judge if
any objection is raised, and he cheerfully
guarantees the bona-tides of his own dummies
—supposing he has any. The directors are
usually loaded down with the proxies of
absent shareholders and creditors, and these
are sometimes all they pretend to be, and
often they are documents signed by
persons who have not the faintest idea of the
purpose for which their signatures are to be
used, and on other occasions, for all the
security which the Act atfords, they may be
absolute forgeries. Every individual who
attempts to demonstrate that the institution
is ruined and utterly rotten is generally
ruled out of order by the chairman, and
finally a resolution is carried whereby the
Board gets three years longer to pursue its
nefarious course without interference or
independent investigation.
• * *
About nine-tenths of the “banks” which
collapsed before this system came into force
have proved, on complete examination, to be
utterly bogus and ruined beyond recovery,
and there is no visible proof that those
which have collapsed since then and have
staved off their creditors under the Act are
any more solvent. The directors of the
banks that are gone have, in at least 50 per
cent, of the cases, turned out to be highway
robbers and keepers of fraudulent accounts ;
the other directors who have successfully
prevented an investigation into their conduct
may be, w ithout exception, men of unstained
honour, but the odds are much against them.
Among the dead institutions w r e cannot at
the present moment recall one which pro-
mised, if it had been allowed to postpone its
liabilities for a century, to pay them in full
at the end of that period by any honest
process, and the chances are that those
which have postponed the evil day will
smash a great deal more heavily at the end
of their three years’ grace than they would
do to-day. The interval only allows the
leading cormorants time to scoop in more
deposits and misappropiate them, to transfer
their shares to men of straw and thus get rid
of future liabilities, or to conceal their assets
and become men of straw themselves, to cook
the accounts judiciously or else have the books
destroyed by some unforeseen catastrophe, or
to gather up their plunder and vanish from
the scene. The Skills Government in
Victoria has already realised that the typical
“land bank” is* utterly incurable, that to
w-ait for it to become solvent is as hopeless
as to wait for the rising of the dead, and that
there is nothing to be gained by prolonging
the agony of slow insolvency. Therefore it
proposes to repeal the &ct of last session,
and let the last of the bogus financial insti-
tutions go with the rest. It is devoutly to
be hoped the Dibits Government will
follow a similar course. The “ bank
which professes to live by borrowing
money at nine per cent., and lending it out
at eight, and which pays ten per cent, divi-
dends by the process, will never become
sound, even though Moses and the prophets
should rise from the dead, and the Govern-
ment which hopes to save it by giving it
time is too hopeful for this world. It isn’t
time which the average laud bank requires ;
it is eternity.
Griffith’s Three-in-One Puzz'e.
Premier Griffith, of Queensland, who drafted
the now-scorned Federation Bill, has built up a
hideous design for a new 7 Constitution for what
are to be “ The United Provinces of Queens-
land” From the title of his Bill, which is to
be called “ The Queensland Constitution of
1892 Act,” to the dead finish, the measure reeks
with rampant Toryism and party artifice. Yet
.Griffith hopes to get the abortion through the
House, since it is believed that otherwise the
Imperial Government will grant absolute
separation to one, if not to two, agitating dis-
tricts, and Bir Samuel has staked his political
reputation on keeping Brisbane and the South
dominant over the whole of Bananaland. Grif-
fith’s Bill proposes three provinces and four
legislatures —one legislature to each province,
and one federal legislature supreme over the
three. But, whilst South Queensland is to
have a double-barrelled legislature of two
Houses, besides being the seat of the Federal
Parliament, Central and North Queensland are
each to have only one House. This experiment
of working different parliamentary systems
side by side may have unsuspected advantages.
The whole machinery of “ The United Provinces
of Queensland,” therefore, will, if Griffith has
his way, consist of—
1. 11 General Assembly ” (or Federal Parliament) made up
of—(«) Senate (elected by Provincial Legislatures);
(b) House of Representatives (elected by provincial
voters).
2. South Queensland Parliament, embracin':—(a) Legisla-
tive Council (nominee as now); (b) Legislative
Assembly (elective as now).
3. Central Queensland Parliament, consisting of an elective
Legislative Assembly- only.
4. North Queensland Parliament, ditto.
The probable constitution of the Senate, under
the genius of party politics, or government by
contradiction, may be at once prophesied.
Each provincial legislature is to send eight
members to the Senate. The party majority in
the provincial legislature is certain, therefore,
to secure eight party scats in the Senate. ■ Sup-
pose three Tory Provincial Governments to lie
in power simultaneously, then 24 Tories will be
fastened on the shoulders of the people as
senators. As their term of office is to be for
six years, or just twice the term of the
House of Representatives, these 24 Tories might
even outlast a change of provincial Ministries,
and be re-appointed at the time of a second
Conservative re-action.
» * «
The House of Representatives is to be popu-
larly elected (with reservations), the number of
members to be in the proportion of 1 to every
10,000 of the population ; which would give 40
members or so to start with, and would cause
the South Queensland influence to preponderate
for many years to come. Each province may
run its own electoral law, so that one province
may adopt one-man-one-vote, while another
may regulate that the standard shall be one-ass-
six-votes-extra. The qualification of a repre-
sentative is to f»e—not merely that he is a recog-
nised provincial elector, but that he has been
for three years resident within the area of the
united provinces; likewise, he must be 21 years
old. and either a natural-born or naturalised

PLAIN ENGLISH.
“As True Protestants.”
There is just one thing wanting to complete
the utter degradation of the Jvanakiloriki.'
Cabinet, and apparently that deficiency is about
to be supplied. The Queensland Coalition lias
been supported by the Kanaka and the
“ Patriotic” League and the land-grant railway
syndicates ; and the leper has propped it up,
and the man-stealer has given it his cordial
endorsement; and now the Orange faction
threaten to rouse up the spectre of Dutch
William in aid of Griffith, and to find out
that the Labour-party is engaged in a Popish
conspiracy complicated by crucifixes and thumb-
screws and other horrors. The yellow flaw,
which is the symbol of plague and cholera and
leprosy and of the religious feud which was im-
ported here from Ulster, is to be enlisted, if
possible, in the cause of the parson-begotten
Samuel, provided the followers of the mange-
coloured ensign can only be aroused to the
requisite pitch of frenzy. The following hunk
from a stirring appeal by the “ Grand Master”
of the Orange pandemonium in support of the
Kanaka Government shows that that great
What-is-it, at all events, is solid in the cause :
As true Protestants, and in tlie name of their order,
they should exert every effort they were capable of to kill
that snake in the crass which had come lately into this
colony. It was very <|uiot at tirst, and its movements
were not detected ; but now it was erecting its head, and
could he seen. The serpent he referred to was Socialism,
and it behoved them to see that no man should suffer by
the introduction of that serpent. Every Christian man
throughout the colony should use his utmost endeavours
to make it dig, and die at once. The fact of this bavins;
got hold of our working man was one of the principal
things which had led to the present miserable state of the
colony.
The keynote of this howl is the first three
words: (t As true Protestants.” It is the curse
of all organised fanatics that their fanaticism,
if skilfully manipulated, can be used for all
manner of purposes. There is, of course, no
more reason why the Orangemen, “as true
Protestants,” should object to the White
Labour party, than there is why they, as
bullock-drivers, should object to the bottom of
the Atlantic Ocean, but they only require to be
sufficiently worked up by a wild whirl of words,
and judicious allusions to the capture of
Limerick, and they rciU object unanimously.
Where - two or three hundred cranks are
gathered together for the mutual admiration of
their own diseased little fad, that fad presently
swells up in their imaginations and obscures
the earth, and the entire solar system revolves
round it ; therefore everything that happens
must be in some way connected with it either
favourably or otherwise. Only a very few
years ago some of the football cranks of
New South Wales—being firmly convinced that
the world was run by football —solemnly con-
sidered the rival fiscal policies then before the
country, regarded in their relation to football:
and finally gave a block vote for Freetrade on
the ground that it was somehow more favour-
able to football than was Protection, In the
same way the cricketers and high-jump men of
the same province arc now being appealed to
by the National As-s to support the famous dual


“ vote for Thrift ” in the interests of cricke
mid high jumps. There is no limit to the
results that- may he achieved in this fashion,
j'lic Baptists of Australia, if worked up to a
frenzy by an eloquent agitator, could be induced
—solely as Baptists and in the interests of
adult immersion—to rise in frantic protest
against the dugong-oil industry ; and the anti-
vaccinationists, if sjtilfully manipulated, would
get up in fierce insurrection against schnapper-
tishing. When the infatuated Orangeman
j s invited, as a true Protestant, to prop up
cheap Kanaka-labour, land-grant railways, the
falsification of the electoral-rolls, and all the
other doings of the Griffilwraitii Cabinet, the
chances are that he will do it in the end, pro-,
vicled the appeal is made with sufficient dexte-
rity and persistence. No one knows what a
crank may bring forth, and it is quite within
the bounds of possibility that the Orangemen
will yet rise up unanimously to support Kanaka
slavery, because of the siege of Londonderry
and the victory at Aughrim, and that it will
lake them years to realise that the Kanaka
never was at Aughrim, and was in no way con-
nected with that battle. It will be rough on
William of Orange if he has to vote for
Griffith, but still he had to vote for Parkes
(and Abigail, of the Australian Banking Co.)
not so long ago, and perhaps the dead king is
growing used to such things.
The Doleful Dailies.
Lord Salisbury played a cruel joke on the
Australian daily press. By arranging the
British elections so that all the Tory “dead
birds ” should come off at the outset, he induced
the “loyal” rags of this hemisphere to gloat
prematurely over the inevitable defeat of Glad-
stone's Irish policy, and make miserable exhi-
bitions of themselves when the trouble was all
over. The persistency with which some of
them hung on to their fiction until there were
no figures left to prop it up, and the lie and
liars had to fall with a sickening thud together,
was truly dogged. They left the Home Rule
party out of their alleged calculations as long as
possible, and when the Irish Nationalists came
to be elected they were classified as Parnellites,
and anti-Parnellites, instead of being lumped
together as G lads ton ites, The Orangeism of
Ulster got credit for being a new and mighty
influence antagonistic to Gladstone, when all
the while it was as old and yellow as ever, and
not a bit more mighty than usual. The “steady
Conservatism of the counties ” was taken for
granted in face of the fact that Hodge has been
growing rapidly Radical since he began to
master the theory that his stiff-backed land-
lord is his hereditary enemy. The awful
significance of the reduction in Glad-
stone's majority for Midlothian was enlarged
upon ad nauseam. Also, the petty, prevaricating
dailies shut their eyes to the circumstance that
the Tory party in Edinburgh had accomplished •
a master-stroke of policy by hiring all the local
cabs at one fell swoop. In fact, the heavy
Press of Australia toiled and moiled away at
the idea that Salisbury wasn't done for until
Gladstone got up and thanked the country for
“doing Salisbury bad. ’ Then there was nothing
left for our “ leading ” organs but a groan, and
they groaned like so many town pumps in
distress.

A Rogue and a Vagabond.
The Age, speaking of the alleged robbery of
£4OO from an employe of Skinner, the local
caterer who was taking home his master’s
money :
The detectives have already mentally credited the
authorship of the robbery to two well-known criminals,
who are also suspected of complicity in the descent on
Albert Park railway-statlo.il. Suspicion, however, will
not secure the conviction of this man or his associate on a
definite charge, but it it is ultimately found impossible to
sheet home the robbery to them, an effort will be made to
have (hem dealt with under the Vagrancy Act, a statute
which enables the authorities, when they reasonably sus-
pect a person of an offence which they are hardly able to
prove in detail against him, to have the suspected person
put out of harm’s way for a more or less lengthened
period as a rogue and a vagabond, two notations house-
breakers, of whose connection with recent outrages there
"as no moral doubt, being sent to Pentridge for two
rears, with hard labour, last week by the Carlton Bench.
In other words, it is permitted in this great,
free, and enlightened land, that the two
individuals shall be gaoled all the same,
"Tether they are found guilty or not. The
trouble is over the loss of this man Skinner’s
Money, and if the money can’t be found upon
die suspects, and no one can prove that they
were anywhere about the place where the crime
was committed, and there is no more evidence
igainst them than there is against Skinner

evidence against them, so the law reluctantly
tain promised by giving the two poorest-looking

jewellery was in pawn unknown to the lady’s
husband long before the burglars arrived ; and
w hen some city office is opened and the safe
rilled “by the use of duplicate keys and
apparently by some one well acquainted with
the premises” it is always worth remem-
bering that the tenant is well acquainted
with the premises. The average robbery
ease is an exceedingly unsatisfactory busi-
ness. There is one man who says he has
been robbed, but beyond his bald assertion
there is frequently no reliable proof whatever.
There is another man who is said to have com-
mitted the robbery that is said to have taken
place. Sometimes there is some property found
upon him, which is asserted, on the unsupported
evidence of the other man, to bo part of the loot
which he asserts that he lost, and in such a case
conviction is almost certain. At other times
there are no material evidences, and then the
law reserves the right to sentence the prisoner
for any term up to two years on a charge of
being suspected of having committed a crime
which is suspected of having occurred. And
of such is the British Constitution and the
liberty of the Australian citizen.
Gladstone's Victory.
Every day the Liberal majority in Great
Britain gets larger, and the ruin of the Tory
Government grows more complete. The famous
Unionist party has faded into a very small
affair, and the Parnellites have practically
vanished, but the followers of Gladstone
and the Irish Nationalists, under McCarthy,
already form a working majority. The Tory
press in England, and the Tory English papers
(such as the S.M. Herald, and Echo)
which are published by mistake in Australia,
now try to extract some frozen consolation from
the fact that in the actual polling the Liberals,
despite their big majority in the House, were not
far ahead. But almost all the faggot votes ”
were cast on the Conservative side, and it is
cold and melancholy comfort to reflect that the
suffrages of men and asses and bricks-and-
mortar and landed property all combined
couldn’t secure even a small majority over what
consisted in a far greater degree of manhood
votes. Probably the return of Gladstone for
Midlothian, despite his reduced majority, was
the greatest triumph of the campaign. * Mid-
lothian is one of the strongholds of the des-
perately religious class in a desperately religious
country, and when Gladstone went to this
pious region with his programme for the dis-
establishment of the Scotch Church he was
tempting Providence in a reckless fashion.
The landlords, the big territorial magnates,
the clergy-—who are so numerous that one
can hardly throw a brick in Midlothian
without braining a solemn, black-coated, black-
hatted preacher, the majority of lawyers—and
every second man in the city of Edinburgh is a
lawyer, and almost every lawyer takes round the
plate on Sunday—were against him, and only
the miners and the democratic working-men
carried him through. The Irish element w'as
with him, of course, but in the east of Scotland
this is hardly worth counting. Midlothian is a
region where the church-bells boom all day long
on Sunday, and where every individual with
the slightest pretence to respectability goes to
service twice and dines on cold victuals in
between lest the Sawbath should be desecrated
by cooking. Also, there is a periodical
“ fast,” and then business is suspended through
the week, and the people go to church for about
four days consecutively. The Presbyterian
Assemblies sit there once or twice a year, and
for a week or a fortnight at a stretch the dreary
preachers make dreary speeches to each other,
and then the daily papers publish gigantic sup-
plements with all these speeches in full, and
print enormous editions, and the people rush to
buy them that they may wade through the
awful mass and treasure it up, and keep it
for reference. Also, the editors issue leading
articles on mysterious points of doctrine,
and whenever some preacher who is a
shade less obscure than the rest “pegs out,”
a biography of him is rushed on the market.
Midlothian suffers, too, from revivals and
incessant street preaching, and it is hard to get
a billet there unless one is solid on the old,
cast-iron Calvinism which damns everybody
who doesn’t go to the kirk, and the majority of
those that do. When Gladstone could carry
this sanctified county in the interests of church
disestablishment, then Conservatism is pining
away more rapidly than even its enemies
imagined.

The address of millionaire Bitrdekin to the
electors of the Hawkesbury (New South Wales)
sparkles with unconscious cynicism. It occupies
a space of three inches, and after reciting that
the candidate has been associated with the
district from boyhood, has, it will be admitted,
effectively represented East Sydney, and has
been Mayor of Sydney, concludes that “you
will perhaps think it unnecessary for me to go
into details.” Of course it is unnecessary.
There is no political detail about Mr. Bricks-
and-mortar Bukdekin. He is the great Bur-
dekin, and that should satisfy any constituency.
His idea of “effectively” representing a con-
stituency, as exemplified by his representation
of East Sydney, is to attend the sittings of the
Legislature say once a week, unless specially
sent for to help the Ministry in a division. The
gallery always knew that things were getting
mixed when, in the small hours of the
morning, Bukdekin suddenly made his appear-
ance on the back Ministerial bench in a
rumpled white waistcoat and a dishevelled
necktie, having obviously been called out of bed
in a hurry. Effective? We should say so.
Who ever heard of an ineffective millionaire ?
The terms are contradictory. One might as
well speak of a calm storm, or a poor retired
policeman, or a weak thunderbolt. The address
finishes by the statement that Mr. Buhdekivs
sole interest is “the advancement of lids my
native countrv. That should lie enough surely
for any constituency which simply reckons up
the lightning speed at which Mr. Burdenin' has
been shoving along lids Ids native country all
the lime that he was “ effectively ” representing
Tarn worth ami East Sydney. Why, look what
he lias accomplished already as a legislator !
Get a microscope and look—hard !
Mu. Justice Stephen (N.S. W.) has managed to
solve pretty conclusively, although, perhaps,
without absolutely recognising his own effi-
ciency, a very complicated question as to who
should possess certain moneys devised by a
married woman, deceased. The lady had
insured her life for £5OO, and made the specu-
lation a success by expiring five years later.
By her will she appointed her husband and two
other gentlemen to be executors. We are not
aware whom she intended to have the money,
but that is a mere detail which Judge Stephen
has deprived of the slightest importance. The
husband had meanwhile become bankrupt, and
his official assignee disputes with the executors
possession of the cash, while the Insurance
Company holds on to it until the rights of the
matter be decided. Mr. Justice Stephen has
now settled the whole thing. He has ruled
that the official assignee shall bring a “friendly ”
action against the Insurance Company, just as
a matter of form, to clear up things. This vir-
tually decides the main contention : who is to
have the money? The lawyers, of course. The
deceased should be glad she died. If she
hadn’t she would probably have been ordered
to pay costs.
Gladstone has won his Midlothian seat by a
majority of 690, and as his majority at last
general election was something like 3000, the
Tory press tries to whoop over the reduction,
and states that the figures are “ a virtual defeat
for the Liberals.” But as Gladstone is in, and
as he gets in equally whether his majority is
5000 votes or whether it consists only of the
casting-vote of the returning officer, and as he
is likely to stay in as long in either case, this
is very dreary consolation. And now the situ-
ation in England is Somewhat anomalous, for
Gladstone— who has had to obtain the consent
of the people ere he could re-enter Parliament
has a majority, in the Commons by the will of
the nation, and Salisbury— who hasn't had to
submit himself as a candidate to the people at
all, simply because, being the son of his
father, he was born into Parliament—•
has a majority in the Lords by the will of
550 fossil landlords, more or less. Also, Salis-
bury’s majority in the Lords might have been
larger than it is but for a loss which fell upon
the peerage years ago, owing to a certain
lamented earl having gone to be with his
fathers. This deceased gentleman was one of
the Earls of Strathmore, and he had the
misfortune to be born an idiot with hair all
over him, and long arms like those of a
monkey. He never talked, but he could
bark and howl admirably, and he generally
went on all - fours, and lived on raw
chops with lots of blood and gristle in
them. He used to snap at his chops with
Ids teeth, after the manner of a dog. Legend
also affirms that this peer had a tail and pos-
sessed one big eye in the middle of his fore-
head. He spent most of his time chained up
somewhere beneath his ancestral halls, and he
had a keeper who used to scrub the animal—we
mean the peer—every morning, and the noble-
man used to bite the keeper when he could get
at him. It has been asserted that this unfor-
tunate gentleman was licensed under the Hog
Act, and at the same time paid taxes as a
human being, so that the State got at him in
both his capacities, but this is also mere legend.
However, the point which most affects Lord
Salisbury at the present crisis is that the
above-mentioned peer is dead. He was a sound
Conservative—at the end of a chain—when he
was alive, and if he were only available now he
might come down to the House of Lords on all-
fours, with his keeper, and give a valuable vote
against Irish autonomy, and the demands of the
Labour Party, and the people generally. Just
now even one vote is a matter of some import-
ance to Salisbury, and he would probably give
something to have that hairy supporter back
again.

A “ leading” Melbourne paper has lately been
bombarded by letters from bank-swindle victims,
offering to produce proof incontrovertible of a
certain exalted person’s rascality. But as each
letter reaches the editor he covers it up and
burns it in a dark corner, and shakes his head
and wants to know nothing, and comes to the
inglorious conclusion that the welfare of Victoria
depends on never making serious accusations
against persons of “ eminence.” The theory
that every man is honest until he’s found out,
isn’t broad enough to defend the supposed
interests of the State in its present predica-
ment, because the finding-out is virtually
accomplished already. I'lie theory that
a man can’t be guilty unless he’s run
in and convicted, is set up to justify the
shameful doctrine that he mustn’t be brought
to account for fear of frightening the British
capitalist. Now, Heaven help the country whose
caretakers are so shortsighted as to think that
it is better to wear dirty linen, which every-
body knows to be dirty, than to wash it in
public. The French and English Canadians
knew better than this, or Mercier and his
accomplices would never have been prosecuted,
and that “ Imperial ” flunkey, the dead Sir
John Macdonald, might have decomposed in
an odour of sanctity.

An Argus leader on the iniquity of Income-tax
was loaded up with the lamest logic that ever
went home to a Tory heart. After a column of
argument intended to prove that a man with
£5OO a year is poorer than a man who lives on
£ 1 a week inasmuch as the former spends his
income in supporting a family, and the latter is
not supposed to have any family at all—the
Argus arrived at this solemn conclusion : “ The
middle classes who would pay the tax would,
we believe, almost unanimously, and certainly
by an overwhelming majority, object to the
impost at this particular moment, and there-
fore, if it be carried, it will bo carried by the
votes of those who do not mean to bear any
share of the burden themselves." What sort of
estimate must the Argus form of the mental
capacity of its readers? No large legislative
Act ever was or ever will be passed by the
influence of a minority, whore pickets a* -
hound to suffer by the transaction. Absentej
landlords don’t rush over to Australia to vote
for an Absentee-tax. Hotel-keepers don’t rise
up as one man and demand a further impost on
rum. And the supporters of the Auers have
yet to wait upon Graham Berry with a request
for increased duties upon all articles which the
well-to-do man regards as necessities and the
poor man never dreams of having in his humble
dwelling.

Melbourne Argus publishes, without comment
or condemnation but merely as an ordinary
news item and a matter requiring no special
notice, that the men engaged on the Buudaberg
sugar plantations “who took an active part in
securing the return of the labour candidate,
have received notice of dismissal.” Also in the.
same issue the same Argus prints a fear-*
some article, blasting a person in the flour-
milling business who. “ sacked ” a non-union em-
ploye. Apparently, therefore, in the view of
the Argus, it is a deadly sin to discharge a
blackleg in Melbourne, but it is rather 'com-
mendable than otherwise to terrorise the
electors of Queensland in the interests of Capital
and Kanaka slavery. The Argus, in fact,
seems to view this species of political corrup-
tion as a matter of course, and considers it a
peaceful, everyday matter that the man who
doesn’t voteas his employer tells him to should be
starved into submission, if the boss can manage
it. It doesn’t even mention that this is boy-
cotting in its vilest aspect, though it denounces
boycotting—when practised by the workers -
in words that make the printing-machine red-
hot ; and though, when the men stop work, it
calls their proccc lings a “ strike,” and demands
that they be put down by the arm of the
law, yet when the employers stop work it says
nothing about strikes. Moreover, being obtuse
and very blank in the intellect, it doesn’t even
know enough to suppress ugly facts which give
its party away. Any capitalistic paper with
enough brains to keep it from falling over its
own big feet would have left that Bundaberg
item out.
The law relating to British naturalization
definitely arrogates to Great Britain a domin-
ancy over British colonies. A foreigner who
takes out naturalization papers in Great Britain
is thereafter a Britisher all over the world. An
alien who naturalizes in a British colony
is only a Britisher within that colony, in the
same way that an Australian “ Honourable ” is
only “Honourable” within his own colony—
and frequently not there. Directly a colonially-
naturalized Britisher leaves a colony in which
he obtained his papers, he becomes an alien
again. (What price Unmack, the Queensland
P.M.G., if he attends an Intercolonial Postal
Conference?) Now, the Queensland black-
birding law regulates that no alien can use a
Queensland vessel for kidnapping—the Britisher
is the only officially-recognised pirate—so that
a captain who has been naturalized in Queens-
land, and not under the Imperial Act, and who
therefore finds himself an alien directly he is
three miles off the Queensland coast, is debarred
from becoming a slaver. There are several
such captains in this predicament, and they
are howling out badly about it.
’I he Bulletin collocates the two following
recent Sydney daily press reports, cut from the
same paper :
Against the Person.
A fine of £5, in default
two months’ gaol, was in-
flicted upon James Ryan for
having, in company with
another,assaulted VVyndiiam
Tarn. On June 11 the pro-
secutor was walking across
the reserve at Rushcutter’s
Bay at about 11 p.m., when
he was set upon by two men
of whom the accused was
one. Mr. Tarn said he was
very roughly handled, and
suffered a serious shock to
the system, besides other
injuries, for which he had
to be treated at the hospital.
Against Property.
A youthful “ dealer,"
John M'Hugij, was charged
with having- stolen from the
residence of Mr. W. P.
Crick, at Randwick, a
canary which the owner
valued at £2 10s. In this
case the prosecutor
detailed very damaging
facts against the prisoner.
The latter, in the prosecu-
tion of his calling, yester-
day visited Mr. Crick’s
house and asked a domestic
if she had anything for sale.
She replied in the negative
and then entered the house,
leaving the enterprising-
dealer near the back gate.
She went into the yard after
a few minutes, when she
missed the bird. M‘Hugu
was still standing at the
gate, and the girl accused
him of the theft. He denied
complicity in the affair and
then left. Later in the day
lie was arrested by Senior-
sergeant Straciian. This
morning Mr. Lee, after
hearing the evidence, told
accused that if he would say
what had become of the
bird it would probably serve
to modify his sentence.
M‘Hugii persisted that he
knew nothing about the
robbery, whereupon the
bench passed a sentence of
I hree months.
A small fine, with the option of two mouths,
for nearly killing a man ! Three months for
a “ circumstantial evidence ” conviction of
stealing a canary belonging to a me nber of
Parliament ! Monstrous ! Will the Minister
of Justice call for the depositions in these two
cases ?
The awfulness of the Jok Olarke-chw-Chaha
Parker scandal has not yet been duly appre-
ciated. Millionaire Joseph Clarke took oath
and swore that his friend the woman Parker,
or somebody else, forged his signature to a
£5OOO bill, whereupon she was committed to
prison for trial. So friendless was Mrs. P., in
the first instance, that she couldn’t raise a
couple of £lOO bailees. Called upon to prose-
cute the delectable Joseph found that ill-health
compelled him to keep to his bed, and the case of
Mrs. Parker was solemnly adjourned. Then,
two or three days before the adjourned date for
proceeding with this serious charge, a couple
of strangers in the street were hired to go and
bail Mrs. Parker out of prison, and, once out,
the alleged felon was promptly spirited away.
It was a clumsily-managed business. The two
men who found the bail let daylight into their
share of the transaction before they were sud-
denly and mysteriously induced to shut up, yet
no official notice is taken of the obvious fact
that they and oilier people have been
“ squared." Now, at whom docs the finger of
commonsense point as being the motive power
in Mis. Clara Packer's disappearance?

SIC Macquarie-strcet North, Sydney, July 20,1892.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
Noticeable things in “ The Gondoliers” revival at Her
Majesty's were the little hole in Bracy’s near-side blue
stocking, and the way Flora Graupner kicked. Flora
is an engaging little personage whose make-up is a dream
of naturalness, but she ought to moderate her prance or
lengthen her skirts, or something. 1 can’t put down in
plain ink all that flashed through my mind after one
hilarious twirl, but if the lady wants to know very much
I shall be pleased to enlighten her under a double seal.
Miss Young is sartorially doomed as Casilda —such worn-
out styles and worn-out colours!—the real reason why she
is blushing a little too furiously just now perhaps. When
the Duke powdered her pretty 7 little nose in the last act,
it seemed a pity he didn’t extend his operations.
Violet Varley looked very sweet as Tessa. I like the
distracting little jerk her frocks have to loo'ard—it gives
a perky 7, impertinent effect, very desirable in comic opera.
And Ryley was simply too beautiful for words, in the
white kid tights of act tw 7 0. Apropos, the way 7 the
encores went on Saturday was a proof how superior are
legs to wit. Ryley simply gabbled the “King” solo first
encore, but the dance was intelligibly done and a double
call resulted, so it must have been the fandango that
fetched’em. There is a subtle charm about Rj ley when
he bolts to music, that few galleries resist. “Gondoliers”
is beautifully put on, and the limelight man must feel like
a benefactor of the universe when he centres all his
energies on the charming tableau at the first curtain.
The circle was very top-sparklesome at the premiere,
and theatre-parties gabbled right and left. I am pretty
well inured to the ways of such, but I regret it when Fate
puts me in the middle of a mob of women who persist in
say ing “ horrid,” and bang me on the head with their
fans—not in chastisement, wdiich we all deserve—but in
mistake. It is a serious thing to be in the way between a
woman with a heavy-handled fan and the escort she wants
to tap playfully—“ Oh, you wicked man ! ”
But the radiance of the d.e. was spoilt by too many
blackbirds, Mrs. Flood, Lady Innos, Mrs. Burdekin and
her charming daughter ; Mrs. Pilcher (hut she livened
herewith copper-pink): “everybody 7,” in short, was in
•he undertaker's trade-hue. I hope crow-colour isn’t
coming in again. It’s the ally of the woman who isn’t
quite sure of her taste and feels within her a longing to
go forth in pea-green and scarlet, which she has just
sense enough to curb. “ Black is so safe,” she thinks in
meditating “how to look like a real lady,” and that
■ is the reason why it is identical with so many “impossi-
bilities. But what is move vulgar than the fat woman
fitted like a black beetle in shiny black satin glittering
with bugles ?
Talking chiffons, one or two things seem to be the rage
across tlie pond just now. Pea-green is w orn by every-
body—even by the girl with red .hair—and bonnets have
extravagantly long strings, four inches wide, reaching
quite to the hem of the dress. I think that is an im-
provement on the present short ties which hang just the
. length of a he-goat’s beard. Also earrings, the size of a
penny, made of fine gold-wire, seem to have got London
society by the ear, so to speak.
Her Majesty’s was given over to Public-school children
last Saturday afternoon, and an operetta, “The Wreck of
the Argosy,” was performed by the rising Australians to
the full satisfaction of parents and guardians who
crammed the theatre on complimentary cards. But I
must confess 1 don’t see why an operatic training should
he included in the State-school curriculum. It seems an
unwise experiment with young stage-stricken girls—every
girl now wants to be an actress at 14.
The annual Ftße Nationale Franchise eventuated at Sir
Joseph Banks Hotel, Botany, on 14lh List., and was one '
of the most successful fetes the French colony has ever
got up—despite the fact that a compatriot, w ho had taken
an energetic part in the arrangements, was forced to take
a sea-trip at the eleventh hour. The only real disadvan-
tages were a wet day and Mr. Dan. O’Connor, hut neither ,
Daniel nor the rain pattered for ever, and the proceedings
were as infectiously gay as French proceedings always,
aio. The attendance was remarkably good. Madame
Kt llermann—looking charming in a white woollen gown,
with fal-de-rals of satin and chiffon ruffles, tiny w'hite
satin bonnet trimmed with gold cord and an aigrette,
white suede gloves—had the place d'honneur in the centre-
of the chief table, next to the French consul (M. Higoreau);,
Madame Laure, in black, was seated next to the President
(M. Le Forrestier); Dr. Laure (who proposed “The
Governor” in plain English), Mons. G. Blanc (the new
and already popular agent for the Messagerics Maritime*).,
and Le Pore Lc Rcnnetel, were amongst those seated at
Ihe cross-board ; while scattered about at the arum-lily-
decorated tables were M: Wiegand and Madame (in a-
workman-like curry-coloured tweed, capote en suite), Mr,
Van der Velde, Mr. Fred. Kellcrmnnn, M.M. Desiouis,
Poussard, Laure, and dozens more.
Jf 1 must he candid, the failure of the French Festival!
was the classic music w hich commenced as people changed
plates for the sweetmeats. A piano and parlour-organ-
were placed in the stress of the guzzling, and Poussard
fiddled while digestions churned, as it were. Madame
Kellcrmnnn, Wiegand, Desiouis, and two lady amateurs-
got through some charming music, winding up with the
“Marseillaise,” sung with much lire and fervour by
Desiouis-the whole company joining excitedly at the
“ Aux armes hut I wasn’t pleased with the idea. It-
seemed an undignified sort of tiling to ask good artists to-
perform while the picnic had ils nose in the trough. A
harp and fiddle rasping “ Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay ” would
have been ever so much more suitable.
The day wound up with dancing to faultless music on
a wax-smooth floor. And, talking about music’, rather a
funny thing happened. When the Consul finished his t
speech on President Carnot, the “Marseillaise should
hare burst forth, but the string band bad its fascinating
eye on Wiegand, perhaps, and started staggeringly off on
the Belgian hymn ! But it might have been “ The W alch
on (lie Rhine,” sacra dicu !
Which all somehow reminds me that I have received a
copy of Billee Barlow’s version of “ Ta-ra-ra-boorn-de-ay, ’
from Messrs. W. 11. Paling & Co. Evidently the pub-
lishers don’t put much faith in Miss B.’s translation, for
they have printed another set of verses next thereto, so
tire happy purchaser can take his choice. Or he can
forge right ahead through the eight verses, with chorus,
if he is in a revengeful mood, and there’s an enemy
present.
The Commercial Travellers’ Ball came off at West’s
rooms, last week, and seems to have been a huge succcss i
according to the society reporters. The Mayor and
Mayoress were present; Mrs. Manning wore a black
gown, and the dressing was, I am told, a radiant thing.
The Associated Travellers-’ best new story, however, has
not yet reached me.
In an age of disbelief, when the main fadisto“shee
the wheelsh go wound,” and everybody’s doll is stripped
to its sawdust, it is very restful to go and gaze at Carl
Hertz at the Garrick, and sit with your mouth and eyes
wide open, without the foggiest notion how, or why, or
wherefore, a dear little white rabbit comes out of a man’s
coat-collar at the back of the stalls, with somebody’s
watch lied to his ear. And how 7 three ducks come quack-
ing out of an empty bath is another tranquillizing
mystery. By the way, it’s funny to see how’ Hertz’s
ducks like the stage. On the first night he couldn’t shoo
the dillies away from the floats. Just here it strikes me
that they’re not the first stage-stricken little ducks one
laughs at behind the curtain.
I don’t think there will he very bare-backed circles at
Hertz’s mystifying entertainment. Most curious it is to
note the nice distinctions my sex makes between what is
a collar-bone show and what isn’t. Hertz’s isn’t. At his
debut the only decently - frocked woman was Myra
Kemble, and she hid herself in a prompt box. Her gown
was a \ ery sweet tiling in rags indeed. The remainder of
the sizeable audience appeared to have its wet-weather
boots on—but a row of full-fig Johnnies, strung along the
side chairs like wagtails on a rail, gave a first night-ey
aspect to an otherwise bald and unconvincing reserve-
area.
In giving away clothing some sense of the eternal fitness
of things ought to be observed. It isn’t kind to give
unsuitable garments to people who are looking for work.
Would a mistress be in a hurry to engage a woman who
asked for employment in a soiled velvet visile half-con-
cealing a forest of shreds and patches? No, she wouldn’t
—she’d give the place to a girl who applied with patches
on her elbows.
Charity is a well-known sin-concealer, but the charity
that is at present apparent on the backs of the unem-
ployed seems to me to constitute an evil in itself. It’s an
odd sort of benevolence that gives a tattered man a rakish
hat to look for a job in, and that forces tan boots and a red
scarf on to an unlucky man in torn pantaloons. Such
peculiar kindness isn’t altogether helpful especially
when you meet a draggled female in an umbrella skirt
and no boots carrying a stale infant in tattered petticoats,
but the latest thing in greenaway caps. The very whitest
people look ludicrously like King Billy under such misfit
circumstances.
People may say indignantly that left-off clothes are
left-off clothes and they’ve only those to give, but when
charity is on the carpet surely a little needle-and-thread
juggling should he used and outr6 styles toned down to
wearable pitch, as it were. And another way of meta-
morphosising the unsuitable would be to send the velvets
and brocades to a second-hand-clothes shop and buy com-
moner stuffs with the proceeds. A little home-dressing
would do the rest of the trick.
Tempo Refuge annual re-union is to eventuate in Cen-
tennial Hall on Thursday, 23th inst., and is to be a plain
and fancy’-dress affair, so that the fat lady may 7 let her
hair down and go as “ Marguerite,” and the dancing man
with the whip-cord legs may come out in pink tights as
“Romeo”—if they 7 both want tt), that is. Mrs. Brennan
and Miss M. Windeyer are the joint lion, secs., and ball
tickets are 12s. CJ. each.
It strikes me that that was rather a sweeping conclusion
the doctor arrived at in the case of the unfortunate child
—a pupil of the Parramatta Elate school—who recently
broke a blood-vessel in the brain whilst preparing her
Lome lessons. Medicos seems to have chiefly blamed the
lessons, altho’, according to evidence, the child (aged 10)
Lad been eating a quantity of pork and cheese and other
matter.” The lessons certainly were rather heavy (the
little victim was gruesomely engaged upon an essay 7 on
“Bones”), but I am inclined to suspect that had she
been fed on milk and porridge, and a chop once a day,
and vegetables and fruit, instead of on “ pork and cheese
and other matter,” she would have been alive to-day.
I fear the average Australian infant lias a had
time of it from a dietary point of view 7. It sits at the
same board with its elders, and its spoon is in every dish.
It takes the cayenne after its pa, and runs a neck-and-
neck race with its mother at the teapot, and then its little
stomach revolts, and its brain being overworked at the
same time, its funeral is to-morrow. There is many an
infantile victim to coined beef and pickles.

with charming ingenuousness“ Women will look at the

And here let me say that 1 once saw Sir Graham Berry—
for one single instant. I firmly believe that, on grounds
just indicated, lie could rule any country where the
woman-vote was paramount.
Which reminds me that the most flourishing of Lady
Carrington’s many fads, the Queen’s (or Women’s)fund, is
still blooming alone w ith several titles on the committee,
and a hank-account in tens. So they’re going to hold a hall
i his season in aid of the bank account. This is a very happy-
time for public hops, by the way. Got eminent House is
still unburdening its soul on note-paper with half a flnger-
nail’s depth of black .round the edge, and private
hospitality lias got some of the official crape into ils
-system, of course, so the social butterflies who arc usually
wearing out their friends’ hall rooms at this time of the
year, swarm to the sound of the tinkling cymbals like
bees to a beaten kerosene tin.
Tickets for the “Dr. Bill” performance to bo given
by Mira Kemble and a professional company, in
Centennial Hall, on 30th inst.,gire selling like oranges on
a holiday. Seats are five, three, two, and one, and every
■cent taken is to go to the relief of the destitute women
and children of Sydney. The entertainment is under the
patronage of Lady Jersey.
People who love to startle their acquaintances with
brand new manners might be pleased when the summer
comes (o emulate the alleged example of the hunt ton on
a certain South Australian far-away river where, accord-
ing to a local paper, Chinese boys arc the clever servants
all the way along. Besides taking baby out for an airing

male Japs into Western Australia for domestic purposes.

The directors of the Sydney Daily Tele-
graph have evidently given strict injunctions to
their best reporters that no man who is out of
work is to be alluded to as “Mr.” In the report
of the unemployed deputation which waited upon
Acting-Premier Barton this fact comes out con-
spicuously. First, “ Mr. Black ” said something
and “Mr. Barton” responded. Then, after some
more remarks by “Mr. Black” and “Mr.
Barton,” “ Burgess ” laid his views before “Mr.
Barton,” and lie was backed up by “Scott.”
Also “Daniels” made a few observations,
and then “Mr. Black” and “Mr. Barton”
had a little more conversation, and “ Daniels ”
had another say, and after that the pro-
ceedings closed with a few words from “Mr.
Barton.” A meeting was held the same day on a
vacant allotment in George-street, when “ a youth
whose name was given as G. Donnell presided,”
and “Pettrie,” “Burgess,” and other equally
abbreviated persons addressed the crowd. All of
which is very interesting in its way, though as a
starving man can’t eat the “ Mr.” before his name
ho probably doesn’t feel so much hurt as the
Telegraph expected.
The Bulletin having by chance discovered
the obvious erroneousuess of sundry remarks
which appeared in its issue of July 9th, upon
the character of Mr. Maurice Barnett in re-
ference to the Goode will-case, now hastens
to tender Mr. Barnett an apology. The state-
ments were intended to apply to another and
altogether different individual who was mixed
up in the case, and so far as Mr. Barnett is con-
cerned they were, as will appear on a perusal
of the testimony in court, without founda-
tion. Through the inadvertent substitution of
one name for another, however, the record of this
other person was fastened upon Mr. Barnett,
whose own share in the business was, on the evi-
dence', an absolutely innocent one. We regret our
error, and trust that Mr. Barnett’s character, and
the notoriety the case acquired—Mr. Barnett’s
position in the matter having been widely and
fully set forth in the press reports—will prevent
any injury from following upon the error now
acknowledged.

Hertz is a comparatively young man in an urbane
smile and a tail-coat, and his doings are as hard
to find out as the reserve-fund in aland bank after
James Munro lias gone to England. Sometimes
ho plays alone, and sometimes he plays under the
inspection of a “committee” from the audience
and then the things that happen to that committee
are calculated to make an angel weep, and it
presently retires in a stunned condition, and feels
glad that Hertz didn’t undress it on the stage
without its knowledge, and make its clothes turn
up under the Governor’s bed, and jam its hat
down violently on the head of the Shah of
Persia. One of his most remarkable doings is the
way lie chains down a young man on a board, and
allows the audience to put a private mark on the
padlocks and to keep the keys, and hangs up the
board and the young man together—and then in
25 seconds the man disappears and a lady j s
chained on the same board in his place. Also he
makes one of his assistants sit comfortably in the
empty air two or three feet above the floor, which
seems a wonderfully handy idea, for if the police
ever wanted to arrest that man he might step up
eleven yards into the air and stay there. In
between these feats Air, Hertz runs wild, in
a manner of speaking, and devours time and
space, and drags the mangled
corpse of probability all over the
place, and swallows himself, and
spits himself out again, and
walks on nothing, and drags
live poultry out of the clothes
of the audience, and utterly
flabbergasts a big, smiling in-
dividual who comes on the stage
to investigate, and then all of a
sudden begins to swell up visibly
owing to an accmmlition cf
cards inside his waistcoat, and
who finds literature falling unex-
pectedly out of his hair in large
quantities. Also sundry other
performers throw in a light
comedy entertainment, and at
the end things get so confused
that it is difficult to know
what happens, but there is a
vague idea that Hertz fries a
chop with his eye, or else that
the show winds up with a fight
between an unsupported asser-
tion and a bogus oil-painting,
mid that a ghost is making a
noise like dishes falling down a
lift.

Miss Jennie Lee has
revived the “ Ticket of Leave
Man,” at Sydney Opera House,
and is telling all over again the
story of that young man who
was a particular fool with a
Lancashire accent, and who
therefore suffers much hard
luck and persecution, and is
finally left damp, ragged, and
with a broken head, in a cold
churchyard, his after-fate being
unexplained. The drama was
obviously written to prove that
virtue always comes uppermost in the end,
however much it may be trodden on, and
in this respect it fails ignominiously, inas-
much as the plaintiff loses all his money,
and is put in gaol on a false charge, and then
rises by much hard work and patience to the
dazzling elevation of a messenger in an office, and
after that falls again to utter want, and is finally
floored by a burglar with a “neddy,” and
his character isn’t definitely cleared, and it is
merely implied that he gets back his old job as a
messenger in consideration of his heroism and the
fact that part of his scalp is knocked off. The
company at the Opera House puts as much vim
into this unsatisfactory drama as can reasonably
be expected—and that isn’t committing this paper
to any rash or reckless assertions. Jennie Lee
looks a bright, convincing little personage in boy’s
clothes, and plays the part of Samuel Willoughby
with a cheerful abandon that is charming to
witness, also she sings with a sweetness that is
altogether foreign to the glaring Samuel’s charac-
ter. Nobody else fills the bill too conspicuously,
or does anything calculated to arouse more sus-
picion than usual. Mr. J. R. Greville makes a
big and flabby detective, and somehow that
capable officer looks a good deal as if he was fed
on pork and tarts and large, fat, oily sausages.
M"r. Jewett tackles his North of England accent
manfully, and gets it down at the beginning of the
play, but probably he doesn’t stun it sufficiently,
for it gets away once or twice. Mrs. Bryer and
Mr. Foul ton are distinctly commendable, and the
rest of the show is reasonably effective. Also,
the stage arrangements are all good, excepting
Hawksnaw’s false red whiskers, which look as if
he had borrowed a crimson door-mat and hung it
on his countenance promiscuously.

“The Gondoliers” has lost none of jf s
freshness, and custom hasn’t staled the infinite
variety of the two Kings of Karataria. The opera
looks even a trifle better than of old, owing to the
copious dimensions of the stage at the Sydney
Majesty’s, whereby these two monarchs can throw
out their legs more recklessly than ever when
they run on little errands for the ministers
state, and the courtiers can dance a wilder, fiercer,
madder jig than they used to do, and there 18
more room for the boss inquisitor, whose lin )ljB
are long and spidery, and straddle over a gr eilt
deal of space. “The Gondoliers ” gives Lauri th ( j

The performance of “Dr. Bill” on July
30 in aid of the destitute women and children of
Sydney, promises to be a great affair, and The
Bulletin devoutly hopes that it will be several
times greater than present signs would indicate.
The artists include Miss Myra Kemble, Messrs.
Owen Harris, Edwin Lester, Harold Russell, Geo.
Forbes, G. Walton, Miss Maggie Knight and
others. Good old Alex. Deane and Co. supply the
stage as their contribution, and the performance is
announced as being under the “immediate
patronage” of Governor and Lady Jersey, and
under the “patronage apparently not quite so
immediate —of Cardinal Moran (who will sit right
up when he sees “Doctor Bill *') and many others.
All the gate-money goes to the good cause, every-
thing, down to the two brass bands of the Naval
Brigade and the Permanent Artillery, being sup-
plied gratis; and as there is room in the Centen-
nial Hall for several thousand people, and as there
is no earthlv reason why several thousands more
shouldn’t take tickets and stay away for wmit of
space, the takings ought to be immense.

Other Sydney amusements remain in a
reasonably prosperous condition. Miss Jennie
Lee’s benefit eventuates at the Opera House on
Thursday (July 21) when the Chief Justice and
the Ministry and Dan. O’Connor (who has been
unjustifiably maligned of late) and many others
will be present to give the lady a well-deserved
send-off. Also, Dan. Tracey takes his benefit
every night at the School of Arts, and the Gettys-
burg Cycloroma still tells its tale of the horrors
of war, and the mangled dead shriek for assistance
on the canvas daily, and the two Aquariums and
the Waxworks go on as usual.

That popular songstress, Mrs. Yanderveer
Green, whose portrait appears in this issue of The
Bulletin, gives a farewell concert at Sydney Cen-

is expected to roll up in force and drop a tear over
an artiste who will be much missed.
** * *
A first-night audience of unusual size and
quality filled Melbourne Bijou on Saturday. For
nearly two hours “The Times,” a new four-act
comedy by Pinero, gave promise of a golden
future. Then “ The Times ” (which lasted until
past 11p.m.) grew out of joint; the main satire
of the story, becoming exhausted, clutched at
minor satires for support, and the taint of Ibsen
seemed to creep into the proceedings, and when
the end arrived nobody knew whether the author
was holding all his puppets up to ridicule, or try-
ing to draw tears from a crowded house. “The
Times ” is daringly original, absurdly clever,
bitterly humorous, and as heartless as a profes-
sional beauty. It presents several strong sketches
of character, more or less mean and unlovable,
and suggests ideas enough for half-a-dozen farcical
comedies, but there’s a bee in the bonnet of its
purpose, if it has any serious purpose at all. One
ean’d perceive at a glance why this smart play, so
full of good parts, is so unsatisfactory as a whole,
nor will the public trouble to consider this matter
any more than they will wax enthusiastic over
tlie many excellences in a badly arranged picture.
Probably the chief faults in “The Times” are a
want of contrast in effects and a thin, uncertain
conclusion.
# * #
Bompas, M.P., retired draper and pushing
snob, is on the verge of marrying his unaffected
daughter to a long, slim lord when the triumphant
sassiety march of the family is threatened with
arrest. Bompas, junior, a pessimistic oaf, skulks
uito the home of his progenitor with an Irish wife
and mother-in-law selected from the “lower
orders.” He can’t explain why he plunged into
bus matrimony, and the girl doesn’t seem to know
how it happened, and the shocking mother-in-law
merely howls for instructions as to what had
better be done. Bompas appeals to his social
mentor, an elderly cadger of noble lineage named
iVKmty Trimble, and Monty advises the stricken
mtuer to take the pair of female calamities into
his household and palm them off upon the aristo -
cracy as high-toned visitors, whilst he clothes and
educates them up to his own lofty sphere in life. ■
Mrs. Bompas, junior, posing as a virgin “ en- i
gaged ” to her cub of a husband, practises on the
pianny, and Mrs. Bompas, senior, endeavours to
put a polish on the irrepressible mother-in-
law who has thus sold herself and- off-
spring into gilded bondage. The arrange-
ment works all right until a Parnellite M.P.
comes along and discovers the fraud and threatens;
to expose Bompas unless that typical Tory will
agree to change his principles and join the Irish
Party. At this point the brain of the retired
counter-jumper begins to reel and the comedy
commences to totter. Miss Cazalet, a vitriolic
spinster who runs a penny journal, also lights,
upon the family skeleton, and for side reasons
gives Bompas away in her green-covered organ.
Then Bompas and his degraded wife snivel, snivel
seriously, amidst the ruins of their ambition.
Also the worm Monty is trodden upon, not
because lie is a worm, but because his scheme
failed. Finally, the bulk of the company form an
abject semi-circle on the stage, and the slim lord-
ling pops up unexpectedly to announce his inten-
tion of marrying Miss Bompas, in spite of every-
thing, and tire curtain falls upon tire utter collapse
of the Bompas tribe. Whether their gratitude is
intended for a holy emotion or a comic incident
the author alone can tell.
• * * ;
Brough is the leading feature of the show.
From time to time lie does great things in the
arduous character of Bompas, but his performance >
is very unequal. The temptation to clown may
be better resisted when he settles down to a task
which taxes all his powers, and through which
very few actors could struggle more successfully ■
than he did at a first attempt._ Cecil Ward, as
the contemptible son, played his very best, ditto ,
Titheradge in the part of the Hon. Monty
Trimble. Mrs. Brough is several years too
unmatured, and much too angelic for Mrs.
Bompas. Miss Annie Taylor makes a capital
Irish mother-in-law, whilst Boucicault, Miss
Homer, and the young girly members of the cast
get chances to score. Miss Emma Brontou is a
monstrous countess, and Frank Cates, as the
faithful lordiing, has nothing to do beyond look-
ing slim. (Which reminds us that Cranky has
been advertised to play Hamlet for his benefit, at
the Opera House, on Monday next). One gorgeous
scene, representing the salong of Bompas, suffices
for the four acts of “ The Times.”

“A Run of Luck” was revived at Mel-
bourne Royal on Saturday with vast success. In
the usual way, this horsey spectacle culminates in
a flat race at Goodwood, but for the present occa-
sion Bland Holt has invented a Grand National
Steeplechase, in order that a dramatic Redleap
may lead his field over the last hurdle, and ruin
the chief villain in a canter. The plaudits lavished
upon the winner when it had weighed-in were so
hearty, that “ A Run of Luck ” may extend over
a second week, in which case several other mem-
bers of the company will receive their meed of
praise anon. Meanwhile, the ostler-cut of Charles
Glenney’s pants seems out of harmony with an
awful yearning to carve the name of “ wife ” upon
his mother’s tombstone. Also, Miss Harrie Ireland
“gets up” after the style of Mrs. George Darrell,
and looks far too wax-like for a country wench.
* * *
At the Princess’s they have not obtained
the necessary patronage for a show as large as
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and the last
nights of the Bard are ebbing away. On Saturday
the Barker-Rignold edition of “Faust” will be
set up, and the Melbourne people who have had
so many kinds of “Faust ” lately, should not miss
this opportunity of renewing acquaintance with
the most jocular Devil of modern times.

Mrs. Beere is farewelling to satisfactory
business at the Opera House, but the lady doesn’t
carry her admirers away, from the fact that Otho
Stuart is a few sizes too small for his important
place in the ensemble. “Adrienne Lecouvreur”
has been the success of the second season, and in
this garish tragedy Mrs. B. will seemingly make
her actual last appearances to-night and to-
morrow.

Things look sickly at the Alexandra, but

An amorous old Assyrian lady has been

Porcupine Gap, recently, when the police examined
her as a possible vagrant, she had £4O on her. At
Parkes, later on, she panned out—hard cash, £l6;
several receipts for registered letters ; receipt for
a horse; receipts for trinkets, etc. A case-
hardened beak sent her up for a month as a pro-
fessional beggar, whereupon the dark-skinned old
girl fell on the neck of Constable Duffy, and kissed
him violently just beneath the moustache; then
she laid loving hands on Editor Bovvditch, who
was at the Press table, and kissed him on both
ears ; next, she tackled Senior-constable "Radford,
and reached his nose with her lips incarnadine ;
next, she embraced two court idlers ; and, finally,
mounted the bench, grabbed Magistrate Harwood
vigorously by the back of the neck and smothered
him with osculations—long, loud-sounding, and
savouring of potential suction.

The Mysore gold-mine (owned in London),
India, is one of the richest in the world. It is worked by
■coolies and pays more than half its capital yearly in
■dividends, besides heavy official fees and salaries. The
plan issued with the last report clearly shows that the
profits arc obtained from a 250-feet run of gold, and that
immense sums are spent in prospecting other parts of the
reef. The lode averages 3 feet and about 2ozs. per ton,
and the output is enormous.

Concentration of mineral is causing a quartz-
reefing revival, at Maldon (Vic,), where, owing to the
presence of a large percentage of arsenic and oi her silver-
sickening minerals, carrying most of the go id, 'great
•obstacles have been encountered. In one big' mine they
have attached lo a 20-head battery Halley’s percussion-
table ; then 40 feet of blanket-tables. After that
the tailings are further treated in Duncan’s concentrators
and finally pass over ten Triumph vanners into slime
settling-pits. No quicksilver is used in the boxes. The
result of this elaborate concentration is that the-ore
body, which is of great size, returns upwards of lo?. per
ton and is worked at a good profit.

The announcement that the Great Eastern Lode
■Co. had floated in London was Hailed with delight in one
■quarter. The Sunday mining “tipster” who rushed a
number of people into Bonanza Consols at 10s. and 125,,
■clutched at this remaining hope of reviving the boom because
the Great Eastern was near the Consols which would now
“ come again.” They have come down to a penny, and
are dear at that for several reasons. Even the floating of
the Great Eastern is poor consolation, in view of the
Financial World's caustic comments on the financial
status of the Lord at the head of the concern.

London, so we are told, is sick of Australian,

collapsing-point.

The last washing-up of the Golden Terrace
Sluicing Co., Shoalhaven river, N.S.W., returned, it is
said, a shilling to the yard—a dividend-paying result.
The preparatory works of the Jessop and Spa Co. are
approaching completion, and as they contemplate sluicing
3000 to 5000 yards per day, even a shilling a yard will
mean a big thing. We foresee the time when hundreds
of men will find work on the Shoalhaven River banks.

Somebody in London has secured Laboucbere’s
influence in favour of the Charter Towers mines. Truth
is persistent in its advocacy of investment there, and the
result will depend upon how far judgment and discretion
run together. But even “ Wild Cats” of the Towers have
something to recommend them. One floated in London,
some years ago, paid numerous dividends to its share-
holders by striking a rich reef, the existence of which the
promoters never dreamt of.

How much gold really came out of the late
J. B. Watson’s Kentish claim on Bendigo, Heaven only
knows, for the owner (now there, we hope) never pub-
lished its returns in its richest days, but on the authority
of miners who w’orked there, the mine must have yielded
some hundreds of thousands of ounces. After a long run
of poor stone, the property has been sold for £3500.

Brown’s Creek (N.S.W.) has again been can-

capable, above all, of a big output. It has a
battery of thirty head with engines, boilers, &c., all
in a state of dilapidation and decay. The ore is of a low
grade, containing the finest gold of low value. It might
be made a paying mine in the hands of a capable econo-
mical manager with £20,000 for development and entirely
new plant.

£3 2s. 2d. At the same ratio, Block 14 raised 1325 tons,
worth £4 12s 3d. per ton, with a net profit of 21s. sd. per

True story of the art and mystery of banking as
practised up South: There is a bank of the kind that
hungers after fixed deposits at ever so many per cent.,
and does all kinds of things on commission. One of the
shareholders is an importer. This individual had an order
for a lot of particularly expensive cigars for a club, and
when he imported them the bank kindly put them
through the Customs for him and undertook their
delivery. Somehow they never were delivered—either
the bank smoked them or else it sold them, or perhaps it
smoked some and sold the rest. Anyhow, the club
presently complained that it hadn’t got its cigars, and the
bank offered it the very few that were left—which offer
was promptly declined. Then the bank-manager gave the
importer his own bill at three months to make up the
shortage, and the customer endorsed the bill, and de-
posited it in the bank —the same old bank—for collection.
When it fell due the manager didn’t pay up but gave a
fresh bill in place of the old one. Then three months
more passed, and the manager sent along an intimation
that his own bill had been presented to himself and dis-
honoured, and requested that the tobacconist would
retire the valueless paper forthwith. Therefore the
customer has lost his cigars, and lost his money, and has
to retire the manager’s bill because he rashly endorsed
the document; and the bank still takes in fixed deposits
for three years at the highest current rates as heretofore.

The British Bank collapsed in Melbourne last
August. Its properties, valued in the hooks at £360;0C0
over and above mortgages, have realised to dale £2549,
and not much more is hoped for. The liquidators found
that most of them were hypothecated to their full v alue,
and in most cases they had simply to hand them over to the
mortgagee, and let him get his money out of them any-
how he could, the equity of redemption being utterly
valueless. Then they proceeded to realise the uncalled
capital of £349,000, and by haul and merciless grinding ct
the shareholders they have collected £5OOO in cash anti
£BOOO in pro-notes. They have little hope of gelling any
more, and they don’t expect the pro-notes to he paid,
it isn’t worth while liquidating the ordinary “ hank "
nowadays. When the institution breaks up i! would ho
cheaper to lynch the hoard, sell their corpses to the
Chinese gardeners, throw the securities into the ash-
barrel, and say nothing more about them.

The Melbourne land-boom has been likened to a
piece of putrid meat which resolved itself into a wriggling
mass of maggots. Then the stronger maggots ate the
weaker maggots, and the foul smell of these bloated
survivors will taint the land until the heel of the law
crushes them out of existence.
With the exception of Bell, Davis, and Malcolm,
the entire lot of “financiers’' now cooling or about
to cool in Darlinghurst (juries, nowadays, are in a
lynching humour with regard to all such individuals)
have snent every cent of the proceeds of their robberies.
Even the fellow who potted £17,000 out of one concern
alone had recently to part with his favourite diamond.
The “bonking” boom was simultaneous with the silver
and land rise, and the money squeezed from the “ hanks”
was thus gambled with. The examination of Richardson's
books show that about 75 per cent, of bis £BO,OOO has
been dribbled away by himself and others in land-gambles.
Addy spent his £lO,OOO in mining, and the Victorian
deposit-sharks are also miserably poor.

the Insolvent Companies Act is about due. The Judge in
Equity should see that a complete statement of the assets
realised is instantly filed for his perusal, and the per-
centage of cost; also, sworn balance-sheets from (he
auditors should be presented. The Court must insist
that this unique privilege has not been abused. Judge
Manning, will you ever again in all your life allow a share-
holder in a company to act as one of that company’s
liquidators ? Never!
# « #
It was in the ante-cable days. The company
was an English one, and an ugly rumour got abroad that
the mine (a copper one, in S.A.) was the rankest kind of
duffer, and shares on London ’Change went down flop.
The directors met, considered the matter, and instructed
one of their number to hasten to S.A., inspect the mine,
and rush ’(hue again. This honest agent packed his
portmanteau, bought all the shares he could buy (in the
mine he was going to see) without rousing suspicion, and
departed by mail steamer. In due time he relumed, an 1
the directors met to hear his report. “ Well, Mr. ,”
said the chairman, “ You have seen our property. Is there
any ground for the existing bad reports about it ? WeP,
gentlemen, as ynn know, I am not a mining man and
cannot give a technical report, but I have just come from
your mine and I will give you £65,000 for her.” Offer
declined. “Gentlemen, I will go further. I will give
you £80,000.” Declined again, after a little longer dis-
cussion. “Well, gentlemen, I will make my last offer.”
He drew out his cheque-book, and spoke more impres-
sively. “I will give you a cheque for £50,000 now, and
£50,000 more on completion.” “Would Mr. retire
for a few moments?” He did so, and was presently
called in and his offer declined again. “ Well then,
gentlemen, I trust we shall hear no more about our mine
being valueless.” Next day, up went shares. Visiting
director netted £30,000. This was in June. In September
the mine was hung up.

It is interesting to read the guileless statement
of the S.M. Herald that the representatives of the Broken
Hill companies met together and resolved unanimously,
“ after careful and repeated consultation,” that though
they were pledged to arbitrate over all future disputes,
and though they were also pledged not to slope ore by
contract, yet they were at perfect liberty to slope by con-
tract, and the arbitration clause didn’t apply. And just
here one sees a vision of Deeming meeting together and
resolving unanimously that though he had committed
murder yet the hanging laws didn’t apply to his case at
all; and James Munro passing a resolution whereby he
was acquitted of all responsibility over the Real Estate
Bank; and Abigail deciding—after careful and repeated
consultation with himself, and after laying the matter
before himself as an entirely disinterested party, and
having first appointed himself referee in case of any dis-
pute—that his company is perfectly sound, and is a
flourishing concern to this day.

To the objection of the Proprietary directors
that a ballot was not taken by the unionists prior to
deciding on a strike the A.M.A. retort that this objection
is nothing compared to that of the miners, who fail to see
why the company’s managers did not first take a ballot of
shareholders ere deciding upon starving some 5000 men,
half ruining Broken Hill itself, and dispossessing flic
majority of the small shareholders of the dividends
necessary to recoup themselves for scrip purchased at
exorbitant premiums.

POLITICAL
POINTS
South Australia is about to re-enter the
federal Council.
Maoriland will be the first Australasian
country to try Female Suffrage.
One of the N.S.W. Labour members has
just been elected to Tattersall’s Club. This doesn’t
look like Labour.
Sir John Downer (S.A.) says he has
learned to look upon political somersaults not as
demoralisations, but as developments.
The bitterest assailants of the Labour-
party in the Queensland Assembly are the
members for whom the grave of political obscurity
is yawning.
“ It is a very wet night when the Women’s
Suffrage League cannot hold a meeting,” says
Sydney D.T. In other words, it’s a cold day when
women don’t want to talk.
A strong Farmers' Political Alliance has
been organised on the Downs (Q.). It promises to
be an anti-Griffilwraithian bulwark, an ally of
Labour, and an element to be reckoned with in
the future.
Mr. Henry Austin, wool-buyer: “There
are far too many sheep in N.S.W'.; the country is
‘sheep-sick.’ There are too many men in the
cities, and Sydney is men-sick. Wanted, more
agriculture.”
Deeming lost his life through not having
been a member of the Victorian Legislative
Assembly. After clearing out to Western
Australia no M.L.A. could fairly get accused of
anything behind his back.
Money-lender Cohen, striking a declama-
tory attitude in S.A. Assembly : —“ Ido not sea
why there should not be the same standard of
morality in Parliament as in ” “Pawn-
broking,” said a profane Gentile.
Chief Justice Way (S.A.) says that every
Australian must feel proud of being an English-
man. Which is just as logical as if that stunted
groveller had said that every horse must feel
happy to think that he is a cow.
Henniker Heaton, in the Commons :
Prom his knowledge of Australia he pledged his word
that no outrages u’ould occur (in the South Seas) in
future, and that the most kindly feeling would exist
between the native labourers and their employers ! ! !
We have pointed out the regular swing of
the pendulum over the English elections, six
years Liberal and six years Conservative : Glad-
stone, 1868-74 ; Disraeli, 1874-80, Gladstone, 80-6 ;
Salisbury, 86-92 ; Gladstone (or somebody), 92—.
Whenever a Labour member gets up to
speak in the Queensland Assembly the Griffil-
wraith bullies hound him ddwn. The drunken
maunderings of a member of their party (which
never reach print, by the way) can be heard
unchecked night after night in the chamber.
The real Anarchists are the associated
capitalists. The Unions, if destroyed, will be
succeeded by secret societies and the deeds of
darkness which have ever been associated there-
with. This is not a threat —it is but a warning
from the pages of history, ancient and modern.
The awful all-round rottenness of the Vic.
Assembly is plainly indicated by the fact that a
cry for the recall of James Munro came first from
the Council, and has, up to time of writing, been
ignored by the House whose late Premier and
Speaker are objects of honest execration at public
meetings,
Mr. Crick promises to inaugurate a debate
in N.S.W. Assembly concerning the torture, by
Hogging, of prisoners upon whom long sentences
are passed. The legislator who would superadd
floggings to seven or ten years’ penal servitude
(including solitary confinement) is simply a brute-
beast.
O’Shanassy opposed the prayers in the
Victorian Legislative Council, and used to make a
point of talking loudly outside the Bar while the
President read the “ Onr Father.” Only by a
narrow minority, in 1856, did the Assembly decide
not to have prayer. Fancy Speaker Bent leading
off!
Of the S.A. Ministry, Premier Holder and
Chief Secretary Cockburn are howling teetotallers
and fervid local-optionists. Their colleagues,
Stock, Gillen, and Handyside, were publicans’
nominees, and Gordon likes good whisky. Yet
the temperance party hope for great things from
the Holder Ministry.
S. M. Herald has thrown overboard
George Reid, the elected head of N.S.W. Foreign-
trade party. During the reign of Parkes, the
N.S.W. Freetraders contemptuously shrieked to
the Protectionists, “ Bah ! where is your leader ? ”
The N.S.W. Foreign-traders now find that they
have no leader, save the man whom they lately
denounced in chorus as “Traitor ! ”
What is the so-called “dual-vote for
Thrift?” Simply the worship of success? An
enormous number of the rich have not personally
made but only inherited their money. Therefore
the “vote for Thrift” is, in thousands of cases,
only a recognition of the odious hereditary-legis-
lator system, the full recognition of which no
Australian public man dare openly propose.
The history of the Cairns (Q.) railway
contracts would add an interesting chapter to the
“Book of Jobs.” Besides the amount of his
original tender, one of the contractors has already
recovered £lOl,OOO from the Government, which
planked down the amount with scarcely a whim-
per. He now claims another quarter-of-a-million,
and will probably get a big slice of it, too.
A “ Patriotic League ” J.P. has just been
fined up North for roll - stuffing. This good
patriot sat on the Bench in the Revision Court
and helped to pass his own work as correct, so the
disaster which befelhim was very unexpected. It
is only in one case out of a hundred that a man
comes to grief when he has the privilege of acting
as judge in his own case, and nothing but awful
clumsiness could have brought the mishap about.
The reiterated declaration that the sale of
the N.S.W. railways would pay the whole of the
province’s State indebtedness, is disquieting, and
is construed by many people as the mouthing of
the syndicate-mongers who will take advantage of
the coming intensification of the money difficulty
■should the voice of Labour be diminished in the
Assembly. This would mean an immediate 25
per cent, redaction in wages to a corresponding
increase of the hours of every labourer.
ASKING TOO MUCH.
INDIGNANT LANDLORD : “Here! you didn’t pay [?] that beer."
CUSTOMER : “ You've paid for it haven’t you?”
INDIGNANT LANDLORD: “Certainly I have.”
CUSTOMER : “Well, it doesn’t want to be paid for twice.”
Samuel Rowe, a Bundaberg (Q.) J.P., who
outraged the feelings of Property by helping to
secure the return of Labour member Hall a few
weeks ago, has been reipoved from the commission
of the peace by the Griffilwraith Cabinet. About
the only thing that is left for the Kanakilgriff to
do now is to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, and
start arresting all his prominent opponents pro-
miscuously. Rowe used to take his table out in
the main street, on Saturday nights, and endorse
the workers’ electoral form claims.
The monopolists have started a wage-wa 1 ’
in Australia. They are determined to lower the
standard of living. What is really wanted is a
crusade against high rents. When a wage-earner
pays away a third or fourth of his earnings, say
from 10s. to 255. weekly, in house-rent, he is only
working for the landlord. If the wage-earners
would only arise in their strength and force upon
the various Governments such schemes as are
set forth in the “ Labour Town ’ project now
or lately before the N.S.W. Cabinet, the bricks
and mortar monopolists, with thousands of empty
tenements upon their hands, would soon be
brought to reason.
Two thousand Maoris (accompanied hy
three Maori brass bands, totalling 70 players)
lately assembled at Hawke’s Bay and elected by
ballot a Parliament of 00 members, with Speaker,
chairman of committees, cabinet, chaplain, &c.
Then they proceeded to discuss the land-question,
tempered, with football. The Maori Parliameu
will not sit at night, nor admit the public, no
run Hansard, The refreshment-room is grogless,
and drunkenness is to be punished with three
days and a fine. By the way, the white govern-
ment’s proposal to admit alcohol into the Maori
King country raised such a storm throughout the
district that it had to be withdrawn, and thus the
land-sharks who wished to decimate the dark men
are foiled.

Max O’Rell is now, or has just been, at

which will be the heading of a chapter in his
forthcoming book.
B. D. Morehead, M.L.A. (Q.), holds that
“no person who cannot read and write should
have a vote.” On the same principle, no person
unable to read and write should be gaoled for any
offence whatever. If a man is allowed no voice <in
the making of the laws that affect his daily life.
he can be guilty of no offence against those laws,
from his own point of view. Morehead also is
the one legislator of Bananaland who has consist-
ently and persistently decried the uselessness of
free education, and scoffed at the enlightenment
of the masses. He would thus compel the workers
to remain unlettered and then disfranchise them
for being unlettered. Which is just as brutal and
unjust as if the State compelled Morehead to be a
squatter’s jobber, and then hanged him for being
a squatter’s jobber.
Sydney Burdekin, whose only real political
qualifications are his monstrous money-bags, and
the manner in which they are worshipped by the
greasy gang who sponge upon him, has made a
spectacle of himself, or the Foreign-trade party
has made a spectacle of him, in the rush
after the Hawkesbury (N. S. W.) electorate. Before
Bowman was dead, Burdekin’s supporters were
making arrangements for the approaching elec-
tion, and they started canvassing the district
before the grave was dug, and while yet the
doctors were not absolutely certain that deceased’s
pulse had struck work. The Bulletin recom-
mends the Hawkesbury electors, in default of a
good protectionist candidate, to vote for Burdekin’s
Foreign-trade opponent, W. E. Morgan. We
have no proof before ns that Morgan can think,
but he has a lovely tenor voice, which is as good a
legislative qualification as a hundred rows of
houses. But, anyhow, it apparently doesn’t much
matter who represents the Hawkesbury. There
are, in N.S. Wales, some sets of electors who don’t
get huffed even when their member stays drunl-
for twelve years at a stretch before he dies.
The arrest of Francis Abigail, N.S.W
ex-Minister of Mines, on a general charge of
taking part in the publication of falsified accounts
in connection with the Australian Banking Co
will be a serious shock to a lot of people. Abigail
is chiefly know'n as a man of cast-iron integrity
and the fearful rackets he made in N.S.W. Par-
liament some years ago about the alleged barbed-
wire and Standard-paint swindles, and the dump-
car business, to say nothing of his determined
attempts to gaol the members of a big fim,
accused of conspiring to rob the N.S.W. Railway
department by means of fraudulent waybills, haVe
not yet been forgotten. Abigail was always a
man of bloated purity and unnaturally enlarged
conscience, and lie loathed the very appearance of
evil. He was Minister of Mines in the Parkes
Cabinet, and was once accused by some rascal or
other of using his position for Ids own profit or
that of his friends, but the House very properly
declined to listen to that accusation.
Wauchope, who opposed Gladstone for
Midlothian, implored the electors to vote for “the
local candidate and a member of the Kirk of
Scotland.”
Artist Frith lately relieved a poor old
woman with white hair and one eye—she was the

Spagnoletti : “ You forgot the sequel to
that Robert Stewart keep-my-naine-ont-of-the-

cently took up the paper at his breakfast-table

The Balmain (Sydney) Ferry Co. have the
monopoly of the tw'o new Government wharves at

Mr. A. Benue 11, Miner, Top Bingara.
N.S.W., writes as follows :
Dear Sir, —It is with the greatest pleasure that
I bear testimony to the wonderful effects of
Clements Tonic. I have been a great sufferer
from Liver Complaint for the past 18 months,
scarcely able to work, the least exertion causing
great fatigue. I did not know what to do with
myself, I felt so miserable; I had no appetite, a
child could have eaten more than I did. One day
a friend gave me one of Clements Medical Guides,
and there I read how Members of Parliament and
other influential people had been thoroughly cured
by Clements Tonic, and I reasoned, “If Clements
Tonic cured them, it will cure me.” I made up
my mind to give Clements Tonic and Fletcher’s
Pills a fair and honest trial. I knew it was my
last resource, and remember I am only giving yon
a true and faithful statement of my case, such as
an honest man should give. My eyesight got so
bad that on four consecutive nights I missed four
of the largest kangaroos that run in the mountains.
After I had commenced taking Clements Tonic I
took down the rifle to clean it, and, after doing so,
I looked along the barrel and could see the sight,
to [my great surprise, quite plainly. I had only
taken three doses, and my sight was wonderfully
clear and distinct. This speaks volumes, for the
effect was simply wonderful in so short a time ; that
night I killed a walleroo at least 150 yards away.
1 cannot speak too highly of the wonderful effect
of your remedies. I had all the symptoms which
accompany liver complaint—headache, backache,
indigestion, pains in the chest, ringing noises in
the ears, specks before the sight, partial blindness,
nasty bitter taste, weakness, pains in the sides,
high colored urine, pains in urination, disinclina-
tion to work, poor appetite, drowsiness and sleepi-
ness ; at night I would jump out of my sleep as if
a sharp instrument was being thrust through me.
I feared I had all the diseases under the sun, so
miserable was I, but I am now quite well, thanks
to Clements Tonic and Fletcher’s Pills. The
pains in the side and chest were cured before I had
taken half a small bottle, and as I continued the
remedy all the other symptoms disappeared. At
one time I was so weak I could only cradle one
hopper-full of dirt at one time, so severe were the
pains in my back and sides. Sometimes a terrible
feeling would come over me, as if an evil spirit
were approaching, which would be followed by
extreme giddiness and prostration. Lots of other
people in this locality have been similarly cured
by these remedies, and I earnestly entreat all
people afflicted as I was to follow my example at
once, for “a stitch in time saves nine,” I have
lived here on and off for twenty years, and have
been settled on the Bingara goldfield continually
for the last six, and am well known. I never intend
to be without Clements Tonic and Fletcher’s
Pills “as long as there is a shot in the locker,”
and I now never fear a relapse, because I take an
occasional dose, and it keeps me in perfect health.
You are at liberty to make what use you like of
this, for I consider it everybody’s duty to give an
account of their case where they have derived so
much benefit from a remedy as I have from
Clements Tonic.—Yours very truly,
A. RENDELL.

ten, there is no record of either having done an

A certain Australian politician’s house is
now watched, day and night, by four policemen.
He can’t sleep if they aren’t there; the horror of
approaching death is upon him, and the crazy
idea that some enemy is “ laying ” for his life eats
into his vitals deeper every day. i'he time has
come when he is scared by his own footfall, and
his own shadow; he is like Cromwell, wearing
armour under his clothes, and constantly changing
his bedroom to dodge his non-existent pursuer, or
Murad, the lunatic, haunted by the shade of ms
uncle Abdul-Aziz, or Constantine pursued by the
wraith of his murdered son, or Richard 111. with
spectres climbing on his chest, and sitting on his
diseased brain. Nobody shows the slightest sign
of wanting to murder him, but his own frantic
egotism makes him believe that all the Labour
party is after him with concealed dynamite. And
meanwhile his chief political pal sleeps soundly,
and devours his huge breakfast placidly, and
presents his unruffled corporation to the foe in
absolute contentment. The fat man who can
sleep well at night is proof against a sea of
troubles.
Ex-Premier Sir Harry Atkinson’s death
was a meet end to his career. The Maoriland
Legislative Council had just opened its first
sitting, and he was in his place as Speaker. Sir
Bat. Buckley referred feelingly to the deaths of
three members during the recess—Sir Frederick
Whitaker, John Martin, and James Fulton.
Oliver followed suit, and said no one could better
speak of them than Sir Harry, but the latter was
mute, beyond putting the motion for the adjourn-
ment out of sympathy with the relatives of the
dead. Then he walked to his room, Oliver going
with him. Captain Morris complimented him on
his healthful appearance, as did Oliver. “I may
look well, but I have my marching orders,” was
the veteran’s reply. Both chaffed him, Oliver
saying he would live long yet. Atkinson shook
Us head: “No, no; I will die soon—in fact’
(and he put his hand to his chest), “ I do not feel
well now,” and with that he arose, took a few
steps towards his tiny bedroom off the Speaker s
room, and, turning suddenly, said quietly: “Send
someone to me ;I am bad.” In a few moments a
doctor came, but the veteran was lying dead on
his little trestle-bed, still in his official robes,
having whispered to his messenger: “Take my
love to the folk at home,”

The new English halfpenny daily morning
journals, the Morning Leader and the Morning,
have achieved phenomenal successes in circula-
tion. Botlx papers are really excellent, and form
a serious menace to the orthodox morning press.
By the way, these papers anticipate Stead’s long-
cherished scheme of a halfpenny morning daily’.

men, for the Forest of Dean, must be a crusher

“ The jealousy of women is at bottom a
different sentiment from that of men, springing
from different causes. It is interesting to note
this in view of the efforts of the faddists of the
press and the platform to have men judged by the
same standards of morality as women, especially
with reference to breaches of the marriage vow.
Jealousy I believe to be inspired on the part of
men by their innate desire to be sine of the
paternity of the children bearing their name,
while the woman’s sentiment is prompted by the
necessity of defending her position in the house-
hold, and obtaining the protection essential to her
in child-bearing. It will be found on reflection
that this idea works out in accordance with the
ordinary experience of life. A wife’s jealousy is
usually relieved by the assurance that her rival is
inferior to herself in attractiveness, and has no
chance of supplanting her in her husband’s affec-
tions, whereas the condonation of the wife’s
offence on such grounds is entirely foreign to a
husband’s feelings. That either men or women
are conscious of such motives Ido not say. lam
speaking of the origin and the purpose served by
a passion which on both sides is one of the
strongest in human nature.

WHY SO MANY LADIES WHO SHOULD BE ATTRACTIVE
FAIL TO PLEASE—A BRILLIANT WOMAN-
REVEALS THE SECRET.
“ Dress is everything ! "
“Nonsense ! No beautiful woman 6VeT Was or
ever will be improved by a dress, no matter how
artistic it may be made.”
The speakers were two lady reporters for society
papers. They had attended balls, receptions, and
parties for years. They had studied the effects
of costumes, the lines of beauty, and had faith-
fully written upon them in the papers they
represented. They were masters in their art, and
yet they differed.
“You cannot prove your assertion by any lady
of high standing and authority.”
“1 can,” replied her companion, “within two
days I will show you an interview with the
ing woman on dress of America.” And the two
friends parted.
Last Wednesday they met at the sahie place,
when, producing a neatly written manuscript, the
lady read the following remarkable interview :
“ Mrs. Annie Jennes Miller is the acknowledged
authority in America upon the subject of dress.
An attractive woman herself, she knows how to
render other women attractive in the highest
degree. I sought an interview, it was granted,
and 1 give you the results
“ ‘Do you think, Mrs. Miller, that women are
'made more attractive by their dress?’
“‘That depends upon what you mean by
attractive.’
“‘Pleasing, fascinating if you choose—more
charming to men and other women.’
“‘A simply beautiful woman is seldom at-
tractive; a stupid one never. It is the soul, the
life, the brilliancy, which render women attractive.’
‘“I’ll admit that, but what makes women
brilliant ? ’
“‘Vivacity, brightness, and good health. Did
you ever s?e a sickly woman able to entertain a
dinner party of bright people? On the other
hand, did you ever know a cultivated and refined
woman, overflowing with animal life and spirits,
who was not fascinating?’
“ ‘ So you believe perfect health is the secret of
fascination, do you ? ’
“ ‘ Most certainly. Artistic dressing is proper,
tine curves attractive, but life sueli as conies from
healthy, throbbing blood is alone fascinating. It
is a great mistake, however, to think that health
is preserved by dress alone. Women must have
proper food, freedom from care, and a good friend
in need.’
“ ‘ What do you mean by that V
“ ‘ Some assistance, physically. All women feel
depressed at times, and all pleasure seems gone
out of life. On all such occasions, and, indeed,
whenever blue or worn out, she needs help. 1
know, because I have been in that condition my-
sel f. ’
“ ‘ And what do you do when in that condition ?’
“‘One tiling, and one thing only. I am
assisted by the best friend that any woman ever
had. It is Warner s Safe Cure. I mean it, and I
have good reason to speak as I do. You think I
am a perfectly healthy woman ; so I am, but I
take several buttles of this great cure every season,
just as I take additional care in the selection of
tonic-giving food. As you know there are certain
times when every woman needs assistance. At
such times, and before such times, there is, so far
as I know, but one thing that can help, and that
is the great cure I have named.’ ”
“ I bade Mrs, Miller a reluctant good-bye. for I
felt that I had met a woman who knew women—
what their trials and troubles were, and what
they required.”-

that every purchaser of a ticket should be entitled
to take one lady through the gate gratis. The

most brutal-looking clump-shoe (an alleged
remnant of the Convict System, but more
likely a souvenir of the Blackwattle - swamp
navvies) that The Bulletin has ever seen. That
boot weighs say, four-and-a-half pounds, and is
bound with iron. The Bulletin will eat that
boot if Mr. Milner Stephen can cure, by the appli-
cation of his fingers, or by any other method short

Stephen, or anyone else who pretends to cure

It is now asserted that Mr. Howler Ross

dreary hunk of his own bad verse over the dead
poet, and then he packed up the offering and took
it away. Also, Mr. Ross, with his long hair flying
in the wind, and his “sombrero” trying to bolt
over the wall, wasn’t a pathetic spectacle, and the
cold breeze blew most of his poetry down his
throat, and his nose was red and he was obviously
agitated. There are only a very few men who can
look impressive as they stand with a bouquet upon
a grave ; the rest of them would look just about
as impressive if they stood with a turnip in a

The proceedings in a late N.S.W. slander
case became so monotonous that the presiding
Judge frequently—well, nodded. The case lasted

“sleep-to” were played in all parts of the court.
A pool was formed and each player made a guess
as to the number of minutes the Judge would
remain motionless during his next nap, the closest
guess to scoop the pool. During the course of one
pool his Honor preserved his immobility so far
beyond the period prescribed by the wildest
guesser that one solicitor openly wagered he
was dead. A certain lawyer-politician was at
that moment examining a witness when the oppos-
ing counsel rose to object to bis style of interroga-
tion. With a clownish leer the politician replied :
“ Object away, my learned friend, he ain’t listen-
ing.” The general laugh which followed this
retort awoke the Judge, who, to the poli-
tician’s disgust, ultimately sustained the objection
that had been urged against him.

THE YOUNG PIONEER.
(With apolo ies to Johann Seidl.)
’Neath the Torrid Sun of the Western plain
There Jieth a dear one dead :
O ! blue were the eyes and fair the curls
That clustered round his head.
There were none to smoothe his pillow down,
To close his eyelids dear ;
No sound of woman’s weeping fell,
There fell no burning tear ;
But far, where the little homestead lies,
An old man’s hair is grey ;
Ills heart is faint with a deadly fear
For the son so far away.
And the mother wails her absent one
As Rachel did of old—
"No more I’ll see his eyes of blue
Or dress his locks of gold ”
While a winsome maiden bows her head,
As the big brown eyes run o’er—
“ And though my love lies low in death,
I will love him evermore.”
And the tears that fast and faster fall.
The kind Heaven lifts on high,
And forms of the drops a cloudlet pale,
That floats to the western sky.
And the tears fall soft from the cloudlet down,
Afar on t he dear one’s head ;
That he lie not alone on the Western plain,
Unwept—among the dead.
Q.
P. L.
Our father’s dead. Alas ! ’twas willed ;
The erring doctors could not save.
“ Ml haunt ye,” said he, “ if ye build
A German tombstone o’er my grave.”

In Defence of the Bush.
(Os Reading Henky Lawson’s “ Borderland .”)
g 0 you’re back from up tho country, Mister Law-
son, where you went,
And you’re cursing all the business in a bitter
discontent;
Well, we grieve to disappoint you, and it makes
us sad to hear
That it wasn’t cool and shady—and there wasn’t
plenty beer,
4nd the loony bullock snorted when you first came
into view ;
Well, you know, it’s not so often that he sees a
swell like you;
And the roads were hot and dusty, and the plains
were burnt and brown,
And no doubt you’re better suited drinking lemon-
squash in town.
y e t, perchance, if you should journey down the
very track you went
]n a month or two at furthest you would wonder
what it meant,
Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a
creature in its pain
You would find the, grasses waving like a field of
summer grain,
And the miles of thirsty gutters blocked with sand
and choked with mud,
You would find them mighty rivers with a turbid,
sweeping flood ;
For the rain and drought and sunshine make no
changes in the street,
In the sullen line of buildings and the ceaseless
tramp of feet;
J3ut the bush hath moods and changes, as the
seasons rise and fall,
And tlie men who know the bush-land-they are
loyal through it all.
But you found the bush was dismal and a land of
no delight,
Did you chance to hear a chorus in the shearers’
huts at night?
Did they “rise up, William Riley,” by the camp-
fire’s cheery blaze ?
Did they rise him as we rose him in the good old
droving days ?
And the women of the homesteads and the men
you chanced to meet—
Were their faces sour and saddened like your
“ faces in the street,”
And the “shy selector children ” —were they better
now or worse
Than the city urchins mentioned who would greet
you wish a curse ?
Is not such a life much better than the squalid
street and square
Where the fallen women flaunt it in the fierce
electric glare,
Where the sempstress plies her sewing till her eye*
are sore and red
In a filthy, dirty attic toiling on for daily bread ?
Did you hear no sweeter voices in the music of the
bush
Than the roar of trams and ’busses and the war-
whoop of “ the push ; ”
Did the magpies rouse your slumbers with their
carol sweet and strange?
Did you hear the silver chiming of the bell-birds
on the range ?
But, perchance, the wild birds’ music by your
senses was despised.
For you say you’ll stay in townships till tho bush
is civilised.
Would you make it a tea-garden and on Sundays
have a band
Where the “ blokes ” might take their “ donahs ”
with a “ public ” close at hand ?
You had better stick to Sydney and make merry
with “ the push,”
For the bush will never suit you, and you’ll never
suit the bush.

Editor Bulletin, —I have a vineyard near

Dear Bulletin, —A pighunt in Maoriland
is one of the best sports going. Boar-hunting (as
it is magniloquently called) in the Black Forest is
a fool to it. There you stand with your “ loader,”
if you choose, in a fairly-open forest and piggy is
driven to you, and with delicately-sighted
express, or perhaps still more deadly chokebore
and buckshot, you wait a fair shot in perfect
safety, and bowl him over at your ease. Never-
theless, when the execution is done, you are hailed
a Nimrod. One gets different work, if in company
only with a couple of good dogs and a sheathknife
he goes into some of the black gullies of the
Mauawatu. Scrambling through the tangle
of supplejack and vines, your dogs presently
get scent, and, led by their music, you find
them bailing up an old “Captain Cooker’—one
of those thin-flanked, high-backed, bristly old
devils, lie is probably in the creek-bed, and you
must get behind him and, dexterously catching
hold of his hind foot, throw him over, and the
knife soon settles matters. It's awkward if the
dogs don't hold, because somebody generally gets
hurt—though it’s mostly the dogs—for whose
Repairs one generally carries a needle and thread.
| saw a nasty thing one day in the Wairarapn,
Hiding with a couple of young Maori!anders and
a new-chum, the dogs stuck up a pig in a neigh-
bouring gully, and new-chum begged to be allowed
fo go and kill the pig solus. Oft he went, and as
be didn’t return in a reasonable time we went
down—to find him in a dead faint with his
groin ripped open. It appears the pig was
m a hole in the creek-bed, which was only
a couple of feet wide, and couldn’t be got
at, so chummy straddled across the banks
and heaved the biggest rock he could find down
( >n the pork below. Bank gives way, down comes
J'bummy, and exit pig leaving his mark cn route.
l jm funniest thing I ever saw pig-hunting was
, lere a large Newfoundland dog got out of the
•losebox in which he had been looked and followed
ms master into the bush, arriving just as a frir-
sized old pig was started. In rushed Nelson
ahead of all the other dogs and s mod piggy by
be chops, and hung on, shaking the pig like a
.bit. We expected to sec the, top of his head
upped off—but, no -still lie hung there, and on
I "'8 fbe pig we found the reason why. The
,i oar bad only one tusk and the dog had got him on
le gummy side. The remaining tusk was curled
'o.npletely round through, the top grinder being
f 'me, and formed a perfect ring and a bit over.

Wi Waka, a noble savage, intended by
nature for a political economist, has just died in
the Wairarapa, Maoriland. Once he had sold on
behalf of his tribe a lai'ge tract of land, and it was
agreed that the proceeds should be evenly divided
between chief and people. Wi converted the
price into ill-notes, had all his people squatted
round him in a ring, and proceeded to “divide;”
To the first man he gave a note, putting at the.
same time another into his own pocket by way of
“ equal division,” With the second man he did
the same, and so on, round and round the ring,
till it was all “ divided.” The tribe was satisfied
—so was Wi Waka. Which reminds one of the
comparatively crude methods of the Irish gentle-
man who, when Commissioned to divide four
pounds equally between three people—himself
and two others —said : “ Here's two for yon two
and two for me too.”

Dear Bulletin, — When the female suff-
rage debate arose in Maoriland Parliament, the
other day, a hostile amendment proposing to
allow women seats in the House of Representa-
tives was defeated by only 31 to 21 votes. Logi-
cally speaking, woman is just as fairly entitled to
jostle with man in the House as at the polling-
booth, but the desirableness or otherwise of
Women’s Suffrage is a matter readily disposed of.
It is contended by the democratic parties that
given the ono-man-one-woman-one-vote system the
preponderance of progressive voting-power will
fall into their hands, but seeing that (judging
from recent experiments in America) woman’s
tendency is to vote directly against her male
relatives’ interest, and support unreservedly any
smug mediocrity who travels solely on liquor-
abolition, Bible in State schools, freetrade in
latest Paris fashions, or London penny-
dreadful advocacy, the assumed advantages
derivable from the extension of the suffrage
to the opposite sex become very doubtful. The
relative proportions of males and females being
.about equal in Australia, it is hard to see why
woman should not prefer to delegate her nearest
male relation to carry out her views in the rough
arenas of constitutional legislation instead of
denuding herself of the privileges which at present
attend her actions, for the tinsel glory of active
participation in the struggle for existence with
man on equal grounds. The men who have
hitherto ruled this country have by no means
legislated against their own women folk, but
rather have specially hedged them in against the
possible encroachments of “common people.”
When the Democratic party (at present by no
means fully enfranchised, while their opponents
are over-enfranchised) secures a majority in the
legislative institutions of the country, it also will
enact for the protection of its female associates,
but when doing this it will carefully avoid placing
class disabilities upon women of a different social
status to its own. Taking all things into con-
sideration, woman has nothing to fear from man’s
monopoly of the exercise of Parliamentary func-
tions, and man, so far, has nothing to gain by
a change from present arrangements.—Yours,
CHARLES JUNON.

is that in those days the boy who stole a few apples was

is a new and wonderful instru-
ment. It is similar in shape to
the Zither. By pressing one of
the crossing bars or padded
mutes and running a finger over the strings, perfect
chords are produced. By this construction anyone, even
those without the slightest knowledge of music whatever
are enabled, with but little practice, to play most difficult
airs, pieces, waltzes, and accompany their own songs.
Very suitable for ladies, particularly those who have
neglected their musical education when young. Price

WILLIAM JOHN LYNE.
What a spectacle for the beggardom of
Europe must be that excursion mob of 47 American
millionaires now on tour through Europe ! These
vulgar advertisers of their own sordidness and
rapacity deserve to fall into the hands of banditti
Who would demand all their millions in ransom
for their shins.
Boots’ Indigestion Cure, a purely Austra-
lian preparation which has met with much success
in Australia during the comparatively short time
it has been before the public, is now successfully
invading the London market, a large shipment
having been sent “home” to cure the deranged
stomach and enlarged liver of J. Bull. Judging
by the results obtained in Australia, this is a good
thing for the said Bull.
ZTIu these days of social unrest it is hard to
say which will be the outcome—evolution or
rfevolutiori. One thing we know unceasing
change is Nature’s jaw. Whatever may be the
result of the world-wide rows between Labour and
Capital, every man and woman possessed of
wealth should keep their securities safe from fires
and buglars in the Sydney Safe Deposit—under
their own lock and key—avoiding the necessity
for trusting anyone. *
A London writer: “ Our ideas of right
and wrong are largely conventional. To an
Oriental a fashionable London ball-room is one of
the obsoenest sights imaginable, and in Mahom-
ttledan countries a modest woman on the approach
bf a stronger Will lift her only garment in order
td hide her face. It is riot the nude that shocks
the ordinary mind, but the undressed, so that ail
artist may produce a really offensive picture
(while satisfying the canons of art as laid
down by the solicitor’s clerk in a recent
prosecution) by painting his heroine in her
flannel petticoat. A workman may pass through
the streets of London in his shirt-sleeves un-
noticed, but a gentleman who did so, or who,
without going to this extreme, chose to walk
about with his coat-tails tucked up under his arm,
would probably attract the attention of the
police) and rightly so. In all such matters the
ruling principle. Which the Chadbands of Society
overlook, is the association of ideas. ”
Messrs. Lawler and Sons, the well-known
furnishing firm of 608, 010, and Cl 2 George-street,
Sydney, announce that their half-yearly sale is
now in progress, prices being reduced to the
lowest ebb to suit tire times—which are woefully
hardi Everything in the huge, sky-towering
building is going at a greatly reduced figure in
older that a gaunt and hungry community may
llaVe fi. show, and persons living at the uttermost
Qids of,the earth ate invited to send at once for
Lawler’s furnishing guide and get their goods
forwarded by rail on the ground that the chest of
drawers which can be bought to-day should never
be put off till the morrow.
Allt's Brewing and Wine and Spirit Co.
(Ltd.), of Charlotte Place, Sydney, have been
appointed sole agents for James Watson and Co.’s
Dundee whisky, and are placing a large quantity
of that soul-stirring beverage on the market. It
is a pale, straw-coloured drink, with an insinuating
odour like a candidate’s smile, and a reflected
glitter like our best girl’s deep, brown eyes, and a
taste like the liquors which some angel will mix in
Paradise. Also there is inspiration at the bottom
of the bottle, and many a man who put his savings
in a land-bank and has been sold up for calls
Would have done better if he had invested the
whole lot in Watson’s whisky, and had one great,
soul-satisfying burst, and th6n lived on the
memory of it for ever after. Economy isn’t the
virtue it is cracked up to be. The thriftless
individual at least has the liquor to look back
upon, while the other fellow saves his money and
puts it in a building society, and when the affair
bursts in his old age he goes mad with the shock,
and wanders about with a dishevelled eye and
straws in his hair, while the man who stole his
little pile gets a “ vote for thrift.”
Sheep cases. Boundary-rider in box.
Exhausted Q.C. recoiling in despair from impreg-
nable density of witness: “Now we’ll get some-
thing out of you. What’s the station ear-marks ?”
“ Block out and two notches.” Interval of 10
minutes. Happy thought strikes counsel. Takes
out pen-knife, cuts excellent model of sheep’s ear
out of blotting-sheet; hands to witness with knife
and exclaims beamingly: “Now then, here you
are—please cut out on this pattern sheep’s ear
your block-out and two notches.” Witness studies
model attentively, examines it upside and down-
side ; puts it down in despair. Counsel wrath-
fully: “Well, what’s the matter —hurry up!”
Witness attacks the model again—more study.
Counsel: “ Come on, man, what’s the matter
with your mark ? Don’t you know it ?” Witness,
slowly ; “Which end is the butt of this ’ere ear?”
Counsel indicates the butt. Witness slowly and
with infinite care cuts out the block-out; hands
model to Q.C. with easy confidence of successful
artist. Counsel: “Yes; well, that’s the block-
out —what’s the matter with the notches V Wit-
ness : “Yes, that’s the block-out right enough.”
Counsel, snappishly : “ Well, where are the
notches?” Witness, calmly : “On the other ear.”
To those who knew the late Charles
Keene, unquestionably the most accomplished
artist that was ever on the staff of London Punch,
the idea of a “life” of him being published is
eminently absurd. Yet such a book has just been
issued, and very interesting reading it is, mainly
on account of the admirable letters it contains.
Keene was always a Bohemian of the Bohemians,
and “Society” knew him not. The Punch
weekly dinners he voted “stodgy,” and even
when he had a right to attend them he seldom
availed himself of the privilege. When he was
seen at his best was at the Friday nights of the
Langham Sketching Club, a free and easy assembly
of working artists, where an entertainment that
would scarcely be licensed by the Lord Chamber-
lain used to be periodically given. His tall, gaunt
figure, surmounted by a head that reminded you of
an ideal Don Quixote, was seldom absent on these
occasions, and the present writer can testify
to Keene’s ever-willing readiness to give advice to
younger men—advice that was always of the
supremest value. Fat billets make fat men, but
Keene, although ho left behind him some .£37,000
in the way of personalty, was an exception to this
rule, and thus afforded a striking contrast to Ids
fellow-worker on Punch. Mark Lemon, the first
editor, played Falstaff without stuffing ; Shirley
Brooks, Frank Burnand, Harry Furniss and
Liuley Sambourne, were, and are, stout men, per-
haps the result of the banquets which Keene
shunned. It may be mentioned that the artist’s
powers were never properly recognised in Eng-
land, but in France, where good work in appre-
ciated, he was considered a master in black-ami
whits, an opinion that will be thoroughly endorsed
by anybody who knows anything of the subject.
In view of the recent reductions in the wages
of the Sydney compositors (ostensibly because of the
“financial depression”), it is interesting to note that
Sydney D.T. proprietary lias just declared (or is about to
declare) a dividend of 15 per cent.

It doesn't take much to constitute a “ groat
(•vent" in the estimation of an athletic editor. Melbourne
Si’jbts.man, after bewailing the meagre attendance (of
deadheads, chiefly) at a recent wrestling-match, devoted
two columns of space to the petty details of the unin-
teresting business. It is solely on account of the lament-
able publicity and bogus importance given to these linpot
contests by the sporting press that “champions,” “ ex-
champions,” “coining champions,” and the handful of
Barneys, Ikes, and so on. who “look after them in their
irork" are able to drink themselves to death at the
expense of young Jugginses when they ought to be carry-

There was a man in Maoriland who bonneted
Slav in and lived to die in his bed—of had whisky. He was
a rackety ex-University man, and heard that Slavin was
at a Wellington hotel. He went there, saw a stalwart
individual in a tall hat, and said: “Mr. Slavin, 1 believe?”
“Yes.” “Then take that, Mr. Slavin V’—that being a
blow on the tall hat which knocked it over the wearer’s
eves. The fighter got out of his hat and the spectators
held their breaths, expecting to figure at an early inquest,
but, after eyeing his assailant a moment, Slavin merely
straightened out his concertina’d tile and sat down with-
out a”word. Next day, the assailant sobered up, made
ample apology, stood a new hat, and they were fast
friends after.

Dear Bulletin,—What’s up with Jack Hempton
and the rest of the Maoriland boys in England—is it the
climate, or what ? Jack could always do the 100yds. in
evens at any time during the last five years, and I have
myself timed him 9 4-sths on several occasions during
practice, and once 9 3-sths, tho’ this last I will not swear
to-so hard to get your clock away with the pistol when
you are at the other end. Batger, too, is another sur-
prise, as he was yards too good for anybody else in Maori-
land, and has, I believe, a record of 16 l-sth for 120yds.
hurdles, I remember travelling with Hempton, a few
years back, down from Palmerston North to Wellington,
when he had just won eight races in three days (all he
started for) from scratch, and had put in the evenings
. dancing, with a little “ Hokitika” afterwards. Can he he
the same man now? It’s perhaps news to yon that
Hempton never was strong enough to stand hard training,
and won most of his M.L. races without any but the
slightest preparation.—Yours, Toruiiaxa.

committed itself to the statement that Mr. Miller’s horse
was the Carbine of the “ sticks.” Redicap fully justified
this title by winning the V.R.C. Grand National Steeple-
chase with the biggest weight on record in the quickest
time on record. Only the South Australian nag Confidence
had a ghost of a show with the champion after they had
gone two miles and a-hnlf, and when it came to racing
down the straight, Confidence was badly left. This was
indeed one of those good things which are worth tipping
in a newspaper, when you know a’'out it. The Bulletin
happened to know enough to think that Redleap was
certain-as racing certainties go —to win on a sound
course, and therefore we “ gave it to ’em straight.”
At Poverty Point.
"Word of an old friend comes from Liverpool (Eng.). A
local music-hall notice says that “dainty, charming,
vivacious Amy Horton is a genuine, good all-round turn.”
Amy still sports a long pinafore and a lisp, we presume.
The Bulletin’s London correspondent says that Buffalo
Bill has imported a lot of Oossacka to add some novelty
to his Wild West Show revival, which is very monotonous.
He needs some good Australian rough-riders to show
what can he done in the way of riding buokjumpers in
naked saddles, not in great things like armchairs, such as
the over rated cowboys use. There is not a genuine
buckjumper in the whole of Bill’s stud. His horses only
pig-jump.
Atkinson, “the Australian Orpheus,” is a mighty hit
at London Trocadero. Imitates musical instruments,
sings a magnificent soprano, and has even sung before
Queen Victoria.
The Melbourne Sunday concerts go on in the most dar-
ing style. At first there was a mock reverence, but now
the applause and encores are loud and furious, and the
music is nearly all secular, for the sacred goes a long way.
Although the London representative of Joan of Arc
wore male habiliments, Marion Hood never will.
It seems to be the policy of the Gaiety Co. stage-
management to ignore the popular demand for more
Alice Leamar (who is probably first favourite amongst
the girls of the crowd), for the reason, perhaps, that the
lively damsel in question hasn’t the remotest connection
with the Gaiety Co. in London.
C. H. Burford, the veteran Australian actor who now
appeals to his brother pros, for help, appeared at the age
of 18 with Macready, when the latter took his farewell at
Liverpool.
There was a large Australian contingent at London
Shaftesbury at the premiere of “ Hero and Leander.”
Mrs. Dalglish’s party filled almost a row of stalls.
A Maitland (N.S.W,)yarn has been resurrected, con-
cerning the tremendous appetite possessed by the late
Yamdaveda, who, in ’76, went to Maitland as “contor-
tionist” with the Keller-Linglook il'usionists. They
“hung out” at the Royal, then kept by one Hodgson.
Dinner was “ on ” one Sunday, turkey at one end and a
fine sucking-pig at the other. Hodgson tackled the
carving of the'turkey, and Yamdaveda was told off to
carve the sucker. Nobody took much notice of him, till,
just as Hodgson had carved for himself, Yamdaveda said,
“ Mr. Hodgson, have you any more of these little hogs? ”
He had eaten the whole pig himself.
A Sydney pianiste now in Maoriland bearded the local
Ministry in their dens and cornered them into buying
tickets for her ben. Result: “ Notice to canvassers. Can-
vassing in these buildings for the sale of goods, tickets
for entertainments, or any similar purpose, cannot be
allowed. By order. June, 1892.” The sight of a
mysterious female in the passages is now enough to upset
a whole Cabinet.
Talking of “ Hook and Eye ” Norwood reminds us
that when Norwood’s name was telegraphed to B. & B.
(he came out in the same ship as Lilian Seccombe) those
managers took him for a soubrette, on account of the
“ Eille,” and when he arrived he found a waiting-maid’s
part portioned to him on a draft hill for a sort of Betsy.
Dear Bulletin,— Had Juliet red hair? Romeo said,
“O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!” and in
my opinion Juliet’s plucky career was the performance of
none but a decidedly ginger person.— Talgoro.
While John Sheridan speeds o’er the ocean, the wind is
being taken out of his sails by a run of “Fun on the
Bristol ” at London Standard.
Lawrence Cautley was leading man in the “Trumpet
Call,” at the London Grand, by last advices.
At one of the London music halls, recently, there was a
big benefit for the widow and child of somebody named
Pleon, and the feature of the occasion was “ an address
written by Richard Morton, and delivered by Ben Nathan
in a most feeling manner.” The benefit committee and
all the artistes who had given their services stood around
the stage in a semi-circle whilst the affecting address was
recited. Here are two verses:—
To you, dear friends, who’ve rallied here to-day,
I have a message of few’ words to say.
1 have to tender now the deep and true
Thanks of a widow’ and a child to you.
To one and all, you—by your presence here—
Drove that a good cause to you all is dear,
And by your firm support strive to express
Your sympathy with one in loneliness.
The music-hall bard, alike in his gay and serious moods,
seems to be the saddest tiling on this earth.
Melbourne Standard of Wednesday, last week, in-
cautiously slipped in some theatrical drivel which had
been intended for the Saturday issue. And so the Opera
House notice affirmed that “the revival of 'Masks and
Faces’ proved very acceptable on Thursday evening.
There was a splendid attendance, and Mrs. Beere’s artistic
acting provoked w ell-deserved applause during the pro-
gress of the play.” This is calculated to increase public
respect for thosi critical “Opinions of the Press ” which
managers purchase with their advts., and the pAfesh
swallows s> greedily. The Standard man clnonicled a
splendid attendance and bursts of well-deserved applause
for a performance that hadn’t yet come off.
| Extract from an ancient playbill issued by Fred Neebe
when ho ran the Devenport (Eng.) Theatre Royal :
On this evening will ho presented
Shakespeare's Sublime Tragedy, Entitled,
HAMLET.
First grave-digger Mr. F. Neebe.
Other characters by the Company.
“ Other characters by the company ” is good.
In a Viennese waxworks is shown a representation of
“The Last Moments of the Czar of Russia,” thus
described The Czar, modelled to the life, lies on a
real bed, with his unilorm and his linen saturated with
Mood. His shirt is open to the breast, and a horrible
gaping wound is exposed to the eye of the spectator. As
the figure breathes convulsively, the eyes roll up in the
head,'and real Mood gushes up to the surface of the
terrible wound. I have never been so horribly fascinated
in my life as I was by that figure of the dying C;esar, with
his life-blood welling up before my eyes.”
Emily Soldene has returned to Australia, after an
absence of 13 years, by the Monowai.
One of the latest London music-hall successes is a song
entitled, “ Wimpsey, Wompsey, Woozelum.” In our
mind’s car we can hear them howling the beautiful
refrain.
Fifteen-shilling stalls to Sarah Bernhardt in London.
“Mrs. Potter’s pronunciation is deplorable,” says a
London paper ; “ ‘lomp’ for lump, and so on.”
They want Dan. Barry to have a shy at Melbourne
Alexandra.
Frank Cates benefits, at Melbourne Opera House, as
llam'et, with Aimee Moore, lady journalist, of the Austral
Salon, as Ophelia.
A London manager declares that theatrical business is
worse than last year, which was worse than the year
before, which was the worst ever known.
The best-off actor is the one who can play old men from
20 years of age up to 70, like Barren. In England there
used to be a young man who acted Sir Anthony Absolute,
in “ The Rivals,” with his own father as his son, Captain
Absolute.
A play-goer left Christchurch (M.L.) Royal between
acts to “see a man,” and while he was out a chunk of
ceiling fell and smashed his chair. Providence guards
him who goes out to see a man.
The versatile veteran, James Smith, is leaving the ser-
vice of the Argus.
It would seem that scenic artists are just as jealous of
each other as operatic stars.
The Payne Family, we are informed, still intend to
travel, despite the death of Mr. Payne. They open their
Victorian tour in September.
The married daughter of Mr. Call, ex-P.M., of Mel-
bourne, is acting, with success, a leading part in the
London play, “The Great Metropolis,” under the name of
Miss Waud."
Cates playing “Hamlet,” for bis ben., fetches to mind
when he acted it as a fashionable amateur in London,
supported by Beerbohm Tree and Flemming, who, by the
way, was deeply indebted, in Maoriland, to the present
Manager Stark, of the Melbourne Alexandra, where Marian
Willis now gets a show.
Toole’s best, if not his only good one. The fussy mem-
bers of the County Council came as sanitarians to officially
inspect the ladies’ dressing-rooms. “Oh,” says Toole,
“send ’em away. Tell ’em the ladies ain’t there.”
Dear Bulletin,—l submit that the mere fact that a
lady is popular and beautiful and can sing a bird off a tree
is no reason why the committee for her ben. should des-
patch a pound’s worth of tickets to all the professional
and business men of a city with a polite intimation that if
not. sold they will be charged for unless returned to some-
body.—J. Know.
Five professional companies were touring W.A. at the
beginning of July: Pollard’s Juveniles, Bella Sutherland’s
Vital Spark Co., Lyons’ Tourists, Willard’s Dramatic Co.
(just back from India), and a variety co., with ventrilo-
quism.
Garnet Walch will probably proceed to London and
pave the way for Dampier.
Leuraane, already a large S.A. land-holder, has been
bequeathed another estate.
Everybody does not know that George Leitch was once
a railway magnate in England, but he was, and was
wholly successful until a goat came upon the line.
The question now before English critics: Who is the
leading actor of to-day, Irving or Beerbohm Tree? The
latter’s supporters aver him to be the more versatile, by
far.
Charles Garland has in his possession—priceless trea*
sure !—a phonographic record of Deeming’s voice. The
record chiefly relates to a card-playing subject, and at the
end of it is Longfellow’s—“ And the mill will never grind
again with the water that is past.”
Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis (Rose Edouin of old) has accepted
a London engagement for a short season.
Sydney and Melbourne commercial circles will shortly
resemble those at the Cape, where at least twenty-five
per cent, of the business people have done time for
“ diamond-faking.”
Gracie Plaisted, who died the other day in America,
will be remembered here as a bright and vivacious actress,
with a fairly good voice. Her most successful part was in
“La Perichole,” in which her drunken song, “I am so
tight,” was a marvellous piece of realistic work. She also
tried to put some life into Luscombe Searelle’s wonderful
operatic effusions, but that was a task beyond her powers
—or anybody else’s.
About a score actors and actresses assembled on Spencer-
street station (Melb.) tobidPattie Browne “good-bye.”
Pattie kissed them all—men and women.
Pollard’s Liliputians have been playing to splendid
business in W.A.
Darmont scores in London as Marc Antony. He has
soul—if he had not, Sara would never have east a favour-
able eye on him. Also, he once promised to come down
and kill Tub Bulletin people.
An English paper describes Phil. Newbury, of Dunedin,
as the “coming Sims Reeves.”
Nineteenth Century Knowles complains
of the “ religions Review of Reviews,” for
pillaging his articles —same old game.


The universal popularity of Ayer’s Hair Vigor
is the most convincing proof of its value as a
Dressing for the Hair.
When the hair becomes thin, faded, or pre-
maturely gray, this preparation restores all its
former color, fullness, and texture. Bland, cool,
and delightfully' perfumed, Ayer’s Hair Vigor
prevents baldness, keeps the head free from
dandruff, and cures unsightly and troublesome
humors of the scalp. Ladies desirous of having
an abundance of soft, silky tresses, and gentle-
men who wish to preserve their youthful ap-
pearance to an advanced age, would do well to
furnish their toilets with

Wolfe’s Schnapps—avoid cheap imitations.
A few weeks ago a father sued a surgeon
in England for the recovery of his (dead) son’s
amputated arm : Nonsuit.
Eor debility and dyspepsia, Wolfe's Schnapps.
Elizabeth Barrett Browning ; “ When I
talk of women, I do not speak of them as men do,
according to a peculiar and womanly standard,
but according to a common standard of human
nature.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps—Soothing and invigorating.
Salkeld, M.L. A. (Q.): “There are only
two parties in the House, Mr. Speaker—the
Labour-party and the Law and Order party.” The
Griffilwraith (indignantly): “The lower order
party, did you say?”
Wolfe's Schnapps has no injurious ingredients.
Advt. from a Liverpool paper :
A LADY who loves Christ, wishes to meet with a
gentleman who sincerely loves Him, too.
She doesn’t say what she intends doing when she
meets him, but we presume she will sue him for
breach-of-promise, as usual.
Use Batho's Baking Powder.
Sydney Supreme Court the other day
afforded an instance of a defendant actually
appearing for plaintiff. But there the anomaly
ends, for it was only Bruce Smith holding a brief
for the Burwood Land Co. in the action against
himself as Minister for Works, nominal defendant.
This shows the absurdity in practice of Judge
Windeyer’s tirade against a certain gallant officer
for not attending and interesting himself in
a certain case after the Government had
honoured him with the position of nominal defen-
dant. The nominal defendant that day preferred
the lawn at Rand wick.
Beware of Frauds. Drink Wolfe’s Schnapps
A little sum : Rabbits begin to breed when
four months old. The period of gestation is 21
days, the litter is from G to 11 in number ; the
period of rest after motherhood varies from a
week to a fortnight, it is said. If Bobolink turned
out a capable young male and female rabbit on Ist
April, 1802, and this pair regularly every 6§ weeks
reared a household of 3 males and 4 females, alter-
nately with 4 males and 3 females ; and every
descendant pair followed the same conservative
rule—then, how long would it be before Mr. and
Mrs. Initial Bunny owned a progeny of 1,741,824?
The answer should come out exactly and without
fractions, or it is wrong.
Wolfe's Schnapps is the greatest tonic and
most beneficial stimulant of the day.
Walt er Bcsant, the English novelist, and
apparently one of the sinoerest democrats who
draws breath, on the sweating system :
In all the miserable tales of sweating that we have
heard, there is nothing more miserable and disheartening
than the story of the publishing department of the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.
And then we have a mass of ghastly detail about
long hours and exhausting labour in poisonous
dens, of starving, rag-clad children driven day
and night by the hard taskmasters of the Society
for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, of
girls nearly dying of exhaustion in preparing
cheap tracts for the heathen, of preachers grinding
out the lives of the poor to get up good books
about hell for the savage on the Juruay River,
of women driven to immorality to eke out the
miserable pittance which they receive for the
eternal stitching of pamphlets concerning the
Bread of Life, and of fierce snuffiebnsters urging
on hungry, bony employes at Hid. a day in order
to bring out more books fur the Carib and the
Cherokee about the Lord who had pity upon the
poor. Sweating is a fine art with the Society for
the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. Bell !
this world is hell.
Wolfe's Schnapps is the only pure and original
Schnapps. To be safe, ask for an unopened bottle.
One week, long agoiie, when the Prince
of Wales was supposed to be dying and drapers
were selling their black stuffs at fancy prices,
Tenniel prepared two cartoons for London Punch,
The first picture, entitled “Suspense,”represented
the British nation in a broken-up condition wait-
ing for its beloved Prince to die. The alternative
cartoon represented Britannia weeping for the
royal corpse. Both were engraved, and up to the
very moment of going to press the editor was
prepared to chuck out “ Suspense”in favour of the
grief-stricken female who symbolized a bereaved
nation in its first agonies. The Prince lived on,
as everybody is aware, and so Tenniel’s second-
string was put away in the engraver’s desk and
forgotten for thirteen happy years. Then all
unexpectedly and of a sudden, the Duke of
Albany died, and Britannia had to weep before
there was time for Punch to get a picture drawn.
Whereupon the engraver went sadly to his desk,
saying “everything comes to the loyal cartoon
that waits ” and the figure that had anticipated
the decease of Albert Edward appeared as in the
up to-date act of going frantic over the loss of his
brother. And this suggestion of the nation being
knocked acock by the death of Queen Victoria’s
eighth child—a poor rickety princeling who fell a
victim to his first mild fit of hilariousness—was
the nearest approach to a good joke that the
present generation of cockneys has seen in Punch.
To Eat Well, to Sleep Well, to Work Well, to
Feel Well —Take Wolfe's Schnapps.
Tender memories of Lagdom’s days are
called up by the news that Attorney-General Burt,
of West Australia, the nearest approach to a convict
settlement extant in Australia, has circularised local
magistrates, J’s.P., and police-officers, instruct-
ing those officials that “onhj the cat, or a light
whip, or birch rod,” may be used in the “ flogging
of aboriginal offenders.” An encouraging press
explains that Bin t’s humane interference is due
to recent reports that some Carnarvon blacks had
been “flogged with thick sticks.” The pathos of
it ! “ Only the Cat 1 ”
ONLY TIIK OAT!
A knotted scourge that Mays
Mosaic trellis-ways;
That skelps the Mesh in layers,
(Jut diamond-wise in squares ;
That Mings the blood in gouts,
In sprays and gory spouts ;
That kills all manhood in
The man it seeks to skin
Only the Cat !
However, these special mercies are to be limited
to aboriginals, from which it appears that white
men may lie flogged as per inspiration of the
moment.
Drink only Wolfe’s Schnapps. Soft as love’
and cooling as his fan.

Chops!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There is a chop to be found in the dry-
hash-house, and this chop is a much-travelled one.
Originally it was mutton. The greasy part had
been removed, and the chop had then been grilled
by an expert for a dandy in a leading pub. After
the cook had served it up with salt, pepper, and
other condiments, it was set before the guest. But
bis stomach, frizzed to death after a terrible orgy,
couldn’t look at it. Outside, a barefooted boy
gazed, with yearning eyes, at the plenteous supply
within. The whole refuse of the breakfast-table
was then sold to the keeper of a restaurant in
Bourke-street. The proprietor had the chop pre-
pared for himself; but, having over-gorged on
trotters, it escaped. The remains of this estab-
lishment were carried, as per agreement, to a
boardinghouse on the wharf. The chop was set
apart for “ the missus,” but, better provender turn-
j n tr up, it was discarded. It next found its way into
the advertised boarding-bouse, with cheap Chinese
vegetables laid on, in Lonsdale-strect. ft is now
0 f a sickly whiteness, and is ready for the brain-
worker to eat.
* * *
A young man enters the city. He lives
on sixpenny feeds to make his few shillings last out.
He can get no work. He begins to write for the
papers. He has for breakfast, one morning, the
above-mentioned chop. It does not give his brain
tissue one particle of phosphate to recoup loss
caused by fretting; and presently the lad blows
out his brains. So goes a fond mother’s son. For
the benefit of the jury at the inquest, it is here
stated that the cause of death was the receipt of
lion-nutritions food by the stomach of the now-
silent young fellow; and also that, under such
conditions, cannibalism should be a virtue. I
know a beefy subject in the vicinity.

Front a'sumuiing-up of Judge Worthington
(Vic.)
Nothing Justified a man shooting at another, unless it
was to prevent a felony, or in an extreme case of self-
defence, or when a burglar was found in the house.
Broputty, proputty ! 11 may bo a common bur-
glary and you can shoot on sight, but only in

J. L. Dow, speaking on behalf of the Mel-
bourne printing-trade, has extracted from the
Vie. Minister of Customs a promise that he will
lend his official ear to any possible scheme for
cheeking the wholesale importation of penny
“comic” papers of the Bits tribe. The thing
can be easily done. At present a number of these
rags are sold under false colours as “ Australian
editions” when they are not even set up in this
country, and they ought to be as much open to
seizure as Australian hats, or bottles of Lager
Beer which pretend to have come from France
and Germany respectively. But the proper person
to deal with this matter is the Minister of Educa-
tion. A Bill for the Protection of Children
against British illustrated “ humour ” would
meet the case.
In all the large-sized town of West and
East Maitland, N.S.W., there is not a single
pawnshop. Maitland consists of one street, about
two miles long, and a lot of side-alleys leading 1 to
nowhere. It is bounded by lucerne patches and
Chinese gardens, but the principal vegetation is
that of the shopkeepers, whose whole duty in life
is to “dress ” their windows 73 times a day, and
try and think hard what a sovereign is like. No
tradesman, except ttjp progman and the grogman,
ever has a customer, and he does not seem to
expect one. He just lives on, benzines his clothes,
waits for his bank-account to wear out, and then
sells out to some foreign fool who has heard that
Maitland is an old-fashioned, solid town. The
most contented residents are in its gaol. Bullock-
teams are common sights in its streets, but the
stranger is liable to mistake the miserable crawlers
(it takes 12 to move a ton) for goats. A joey-nute
man, the other day, had no difficulty in passing
several forged “livers,” purporting to be on the
BankofN.S. Wales, the receivers being so over-
come with emotion that they were on the point of
getting up a banquet in,honor of the opulent visitor
when the forgeries were discovered, and a peni-
tential meeting was held instead. Even the
publicans are dejected. Swaggie doesn’t get half
drunk enough now, and Papercollar patronises
°nly the threepenny bar. Maitland has architects
whose clerks never draw anything but one leg
after the other ; solicitors whose whole business is
connected with wills, mortgages, loans, &c. ;
doctors who are only needed when the mid-
wife is ; and chemists whose most serious
trade rivals are the barbers. The town
has magnificent banks which you hardly ever
■see auyboding entering. The best-looking town
house is the lawn-fronted, trim-hedged, godly
parsonage, that smugs on complacently in contrast
to hundreds of battered, vermin-infested hovels
°* the Noah’s Ark style of architecture. Any
stranger_ who enters a Maitland hotel and
shouts •’ for “ all in the bar ” at once secures the
tnendship for life of that landlord, and runs the
'’■sk of being waited on bv a deputation of
homage, headed by the Mayor and the local bill
poster. But ask a Maitland tradesman to buy

JN FAVOUR OF MOTHERS-IN-LAW.
Perhaps one of the best-abused individuals
under what Mrs. Partington would designate the
“blue canister of heaven ” is the lady who attains
to membership in the distinguished order of
mothers-in law. Why it is, however, that she,
above all others of her sex, should be singled out
for ridicule and coarse jest, is about as difficult
to understand as is the wisdom of Providence in
permitting otherwise peaceful bedchambers to be
turned into haunts of wretchedness and profanity
through the existence of the bloodthirsty vagrant
mosquito. What dreadful crime has the unfortu-
nate woman committed in providing the man with
his wife that he should bear her such an undying
grudge ? When the young couple first enter upon
the mysteries of housekeeping, who is it that
comes along and with her practical experience
and good sense shows them an easy way over
rough places? The man’s mother in-law. And
when the first little pledge of affection makes
its appearance, as well as the successive ones,
who is it that steps in and relieves the
husband's anxiety, and takes the load of care
and worry off the wife’s feeble shoulders, and
keeps the household machinery running smoothly ?
Why, the man’s mother in-law. For all of which
devotion he rewards her by making heartless jokes
at her expense, and publishing them for other
men to snigger over ! Ingratitude, thy name is
man ! Mothers-in-law are not what the satirist
has painted them. This is a petrified fact that
cannot be too forcibly rammed into the receptive
apparatus of the average young benedict who
somehow gets away with the notion that the
world without his presence in it would be a
pronounced failure. The sum of human know-
ledge is ever on the increase. For example, at one
period the rheumatic sufferer held the belief that,
apart from medical skill directly applied iu the
person of one of the “ duly qualified,” there was
no relief for his malady. He has since grown
wiser in his generation ; and now when the
twinges of some muscular disease denote the
approaching attack, he invests a modest half-
crown upon a bottle of St. .Jacobs Oil, and van-
quishes the unwelcome foe at the inception of the
strife. With a supply of this truly invaluable
pain conqueror in the house, anyone may be his
or her own physician in curing nearly every de-
scription of accidental injury, as well as in eradi-
cating the pains occasioned by neuralgia, rheuma-
tism, gout, backache, toothache, etc., and ulti-
mately putting to flight the prevailing cause of
such suffering.

this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

A REAL MAN OF MARK.
“Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Rarns-
clen’s ease is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, after mn / Sydney doctors gave I i.n up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “ doctors ” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission in the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,
N.S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
“Herr Rassmussen, of whose famous Herbal Remedies
everybody has heard, has held the position of Lecturer to
several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became
known by the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of
which he has numerous tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic scientists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world—are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
had given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.
—Sydney, 9th January, 1892.
WHO IS RASSMUSSEN ?
“ Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. We have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was
awarded a Gold Medal for his Alfaline Remedies, and he is
author of some valuable Medical Works, We hope ho will
be as successful in Victoria as he has been in New South
Wales.”— The Essenden and Flemington Chronicle and

The Drover’s Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The “ house ” contains two rooms ; is built
of round timber - , slabs, and stringy-bark, and
floored with split slabs. A big bark kitchen
stands at the end, and is larger than the house,
itself, verandah included.
Bush all round —.bush with no horizon, for the
country is flat. No ranges in the distance. The
hush consists of stunted, rotten “native apple
trees.” No undergrowth. Nothing to relieve the
eye, save the darker green of a few she oaks which
are sighing above the narrow, almost waterless
creek. Nineteen miles to the nearest civilisation
a shanty on the main road.
!he drover—an ex-squatter—is away with sheep.
His wife and children are left here alone. ,
Four ragged, dried up-looking children are play-
ing about the house. Suddenly one of them yells:
Snake ! Mother, here’s a snake !”
I he gaunt, sun-browned bushwoman darts from
the kitchen, snatches “the baby” from the
ground, holds it on her left hip, and reaches for a
stick.
“ Where is it ?”
“Here! gone into the wood-heap!” yells the
eldest boy—a sharp-faced, excited urchin of eleven.
‘Stop there, mother!’ I’ll have the !” (he
swears like a trooper) “ I’ll have the !”
‘Tommy, come here, or you’ll be bit. Come
here at once when I tell you, you little wretch !
“ ~ you (that I should say such a thing!', come
e * e • ’ s ho shrieks. Her voice is not very musical.
The youngster swears beneath his breath, and
comes reluctantly, carrying a stick nearly as big
a * himself. Suddenly he yells, triumphantly :
I here it goes, under the house!” and darts
away, with club uplifted. At the same time, the
'g, black, yellow-eyed dog-of-all-breeds, who has
f'°' vn the greatest interest in the proceedings,
breaks his chain and darts after the snake. He is
a moment late, however, and his nose reaches the
crack in the slabs just as the end of the snake’s
ai disappears. Almost at the same moment the
°y s dub comes down and skins the aforesaid
nos e- The dog takes small notice of this and pro-
ceeds to undermine the building; but he is sub-
„!f c a struggle and chained up. They can’t
aff ord to lose him.
c^rovprs makes the children stand
ler near the dog-house while she watches for

thro n-T lere anc l may at any moment come up
she crac b s ' n the rough slab floor. So
carries several armfuls of firewood into the
kitchen, and then takes the children there. The
kitchen has “no floor,” or rather an earthen one
called a “ground floor ” in this part of the bush.
There is a large, roughly-made table in the centre
of the place. She brings the children in and
makes them get on this table. They are two boys
and two girls—mere babies. She gives them some
supper, and then, before it gets dark, she goes
into the house, and snatches up some pillows and
bed-clothes—expecting to see or lay her hand on
the snake any minute. She makes a bed on the
kitchen-table for the children and sits down beside
it to watch all night,
She has an eye on the corner, and a green sap-
bug chib laid in readiness on the dresser by her
side; also her sewing basket, and a copy of the
Young Ladies’Journal. She has brought the
dog into the room.
Tommy turns in under protest, and says he’ll
lay awake all night and smash that nameless
snake,
His mother asks him how many times she has
told him not to swear.
He has his club with him under the bed-clothes,
and the child next to him protests :
“Mummy! Tommy’s skinnin’ me alive wif
his club. Make him take it out.”
Tommy: “Shet up, you little ! D’yer
want to be bit with the snake?”
.Tacky shuts up.
“If yer bit,” says Tommy, after a pause,
“ you’ll swell up, an’ smell, an’ turn red an’ green
an’ blue all over till you bust. Won’t he,
mother 5”
“Now then, don’t frighten the child. Go to
sleep,” she says.
The two younger children go to sleep, and now
mid then .Tacky complains of being “skeezed.”
More room is made for him. Presently Tommy
says: “Mother! listen to them (adjective) little
possums. I’d like to screw their blanky necks.”
And Jacky protests drowsily,
“ But they don’t hurt us, the little blanks !”
Mother : “There, I told you you’d teach Jacky
to swear.” But Jacky’s remark makes her smile,
Jacky goes to sleep.
Presently, Tommy asks :
“Mother! Do you think they’ll ever extricate
the (adjective) kangaroo?”
“Lord! How am I to know, child? Goto
sleep.”
“ Will you wake me if the snake comes out?”
“Yes. Go to sleep.”
* # *
Near midnight. The children are all
asleep and she still sits there, sewing and read-
ing by turns. From time to time she glances
round the floor and wall-plate, and, whenever she
hears a noise, she reaches for the stick. The
thunder-storm comes on, and the wind rushing thro’
the cracks in the slab wall threatens to blow out
her candle. She places it on a sheltered part of
the dresser, and fixes up a newspaper to protect
it. At every flash of lightning, the cracks between
the slabs gleam like polished silver. The thunder
rolls, and the rain comes down in torrents.
“ Alligator ” (the dog) lies at full length on the
floor, with his eyes turned towards the partition.
She knows by this that the snake is still there.
There are large cracks in that wall opening under
the floor of the dwelling-house.
She is not a coward, but recent events have
shaken her nerves. A little son of her brother-
in-law was lately bitten by a snake, and died.
Besides, she has not heard from her husband for
six months, and is anxious about him.
He was a drover and started squatting here
when they were married. The drought of 18—
ruined him. He had to sacrifice the I’emnant of
his flock and go droving again. He intends to
move his family into the nearest town when he
comes back, and in the meantime his brother, who
lives on the main road, comes over about once a
month with provisions. The wife has still a
couple of cows, one horse, and a few sheep. The
brother-in-law kills one of the latter occasionally,
gives her what she needs of it, and takes the rest
in return for other provisions.
She is used to being left alone. She once lived
like this for 18 months. As a girl she built, we
suppose, the usual air-castles, but all her girlish
hopes and aspirations are dead. She finds all the
excitement and recreation she needs in the
Young Ladies’ Journal, and, Heaven help her,
takes a pleasure in the fashion-plates.
Her husband is a native, and so is she. He is
careless, but a good husband enough. If he had
the means he would take her to the city and keep
her there like a princess. They are used to being
apart, or at least she is. “No use frettin’, ’ she
says. He may forget sometimes that he is
married, but if he has a good cheque when he
comes back he will give most of it to her. When
he had money he took her to the city several
times—hired a railway sleeping compartment, and
put up at the best hotels. He also bought her a
buggy, but they had to sacrifice it.
The last two children were born in the bush—
one while her husband was bringing a drunken
doctor, by force, to attend on her. She was alone
on this occasion, and very weak. She had been
ill with a fever. She prayed to God to send her
assistance. God sent “ Black Mary,” the
“ whitest ” gin in all the land.
One of her children died while she was here
alone. She rode nineteen miles for assistance,
carrying the dead child.
• * *
It must be near one or two o’clock. The
fire is burning low. Alligator lies with his head
resting on his paws, and watches the wall. He is
not a very beautiful dog to look at, and the light
shows numerous old wounds where the hair will
not grow. He is afraid of nothing on the face of
the earth or under it. He will tackle a bullock as
readily as he will tackle a flea. Ho hates all other
dogs—except kangaroo-dogs—and has a marked
dislike to friends or relations of the family. Tliev
seldom call, however. He sometimes makes
friends with strangers. lie hates snakes, and lias
killed many, but lie will be bitten some day and
die ; most snake-dogs end that way.
Now and then the bushwoman lays down her
work and watches, and listens, and thinks. She
thinks of things in her own life, for there is little
else to think about.
The rain will make the grass grow, and this re-
minds her how she fought a bush-fire once while her
husband was away. The grass was long, and very
dry, and the fire threatened to burn her out. She
put on an old pair of her husband’s trousers, anti
beat out the flames with a green bough till great
drops of sooty perspiration stood out on her fore-
head and ran in streaks down her blackened arms.
The sight of his mother in trousers greatly amused
Tommy, who worked like a little hero by her
side; but the baby howled lustily until his mother
appeared in skirts again. The fire almost
mastered her, but four excited bushmen arrived
just in time.
She thinks how she fought a flood during her
husband’s absence. She stood for hours in the
drenching downpour, and dug a drain to save the
dam across the creek. But she could not save it.
There are things that a bushwoman cannot do.
Next morning the dam was broken, and her heart
was nearly broken too, for she thought how her
husband would feel when he came home and saw
the result of months of labour swept away. She
“cried” then.
She also fought the pleuro-pneumonia, dosed
and bled the few remaining cattle, and wept again
when her two best cows died.
Again, she fought a mad bullock that beseiged
the house for a day. She made bullets and fired
at him thro’ cracks in the slabs, with an old shot-
gun, He was dead in the morning. She skinned
him, and afterwards got 7s. Gel. for the hide.
She also fights the crows and eagles that have
designs on her chickens. Her plan of campaign
is very original. The children cry “Crows,
mother !” and she rushes out and aims a broom-
stick at the birds as though it were a gun, and says
“Bung!” The crows leave in a hurry; they are
cunning, but a woman’s cunning is greater.
Occasionally a bushman in the “ horrors,” or a
villainous-looking “sundowner,” comes and scares
the life out of her. She generally tells the suspi-
cious-looking stranger that her “ husband and two
sons are at work below the dam,” for he always
cunningly enquiries for “the boss.”
Only last week a gallows-faced swagman—
having satisfied himself or been informed that
there were no men on the place—threw his swag
down on the verandah, and demanded tucker.
She gave him something to eat, and then he
expressed his intention of staying for tie night.
It was sundown then. She got a batten from the
sofa, loosened the dog, and confronted the strangi r
—holding the batten in one hand and the dog’s
collar with the other. “ Now you go !” she said.
He looked at her and at the dog, said “ Allright,
mum,” in a cringing tone, and left. She was a
determined-looking woman, and Alligator's yellow

eyes glared unpleasantly. Besides, the dog’s
chawing-up apparatus greatly resembled that of
his namesake.
• * #
She has few pleasures to think of as she
sits here alone by the tire and watches for a snake.
All days are much the same to her; but on Sun-
day afternoon she dresses herself, tidies the
children, smartens-up baby, and goes for a lonely
walk along the bush-track, pushing an old peram-
bulator in front of her. She does this every
Sunday. She takes as much care to make herself
and the children “look smart” as she would if
she were going to “do the block” in Sydney.
There is nothing to see, however, and not a soul
to meet. You might walk for 20 miles along this
track without being able to fix a point in your
mind, unless you are a bushman. It is because of
the madding, everlasting sameness jf the stunted
trees, the quality that makes a new-chum long to
break away and travel as far as trains can go, and
sail as far as ships can sail—and further.
But this bushwoman is used to the loneliness of
it. As a girl-wife she hated it, but now she
would feel strange away from it.
She is glad when her husband returns, but she
does not gush or make a fuss about it. She gets
him something good to eat and tidies up the
children.
She seems contented with her lot. She loves
her children, but has no time to show it. She
seems harsh to them. Her surroundings are not
favourable to the development of the womanly or
sentimental side of nature,
# # *
It must be near morning now, but the 1
clock is in the other room. Her candle is nearly
done ; she forgot that she is out of candles. Some,
more wood must be got to keep the fire up, and stq
she shuts the dog inside and hurries round to the
woodheap. The X’ain lias cleared off. She seizes
a stick, pulls it out, and—crash ! the whole pile
collapses, and nearly frightens her to death.
Yesterday she bargained with a stray black-
fellow to bring her some wood, and while he was
at work she went in search of a missing cow. She-
was absent an hour or so, and the black made>
good use of his time. On her return she was
astonished by seeing a great heap of wood by the
chimney. She gave the black an extra fig of
tobacco, and praised him for not being lazy. He
thanked her, and left with head erect. But he
built the viood-heap hollow.
She is hurt now, and tears spring to her eyes as
she sits down again by the table. She snatches up
a handkerchief to wipe the tears away, but pokes;
her eyes with her bare fingers instead. The hand-
kerchief is full of holes, and site finds that she has
put her thumb through one, and her forefinger
through another.
This makes her laugh suddenly, to the surprise
of the dog. She has a keen, very keen sense of
the ridiculous ; and sometime or another she will
amuse bushmen by relating this incident.
She was amused once before in a manner similar
in some respects. One day she sat down “ to
have a good cry,” as she said - and the old cab
rubbed against her dress and “cried, too.” Then
she “ had to laugh.”
# * *
It must be near daylight now. The room
is very close and hot because of the fire. Alligator
still watches the wall from time to time. Suddenly
he becomes greatly interested ; he draws himself
a few inches nearer the partition, and a thrill
runs through his body. The hair on the back of
his neck begins to bristle, and the battle light is
in his yellow eyes. She knows what this means,
and lays her hand on the stick. The lower
end of one of the partition slabs has a large
crack on each side of it. An evil pair of small,
bright, bead-like eyes glisten at one of these
holes. The snake—a black one—comes slowly out,
about a foot, and moves its head up and down.
The dog lies still, and the woman sits as one fas-
cinated. The snake comes out a foot further. She
lifts her stick, and the reptile, as though suddenly
aware of danger, sticks his head in through the
crack on the other side of the slab, and hurries to
get his tail round after him. Alligator springs,
and his jaws come together with a snap. He
misses this time, for his nose is large, and the
snake’s body close down in the angle formed by
the slabs and the floor. He snaps again as the
tail comes round. He has the snake now, and
tugs it out eighteen inches. Thud, thud, comes the
woman’s club on the ground. Alligator pulls again.
Thud, thud. Alligator pulls some more. Hehasthe
snake out now—a black brute, five feet long. The
head rises to dart about, but the dog has the
enemy close to the neck. He is a big, heavy dog,
but as quick as a terrier. He shakes the snake as
tho’ he felt the curse of Toil in common with
mankind. The eldest boy wakes up, seizes his
stick, and makes to get out of bed, but his mother
forces him back witn a grip of iron. Thud, thud ;
the snake’s back is broken in several places.
Thud, thud ; the head is crushed, and Alligator’s
nose skinned again.
She lifts the mangled reptile on the point of her
stick, carries it to the fire, and throws it in. Then
she piles on the wood and watches the snake burn.
The boy and dog watch, too. She lays her hand,
on the dog’s head, and all the fierce, angry light'
dies out of his yellow eyes. The younger children
,pire quieted, and presently go to sleep. The
dirty-legged boy stands for a moment in his shirt, ,
watching the fire. Presently he looks at her. He
sees the tears in her eyes, and, suddenly throwing t
ins arms round her neck, exclaims :
“Mother, I won’t never go drovin’; blast me,
if I do !”
And she hugs him to her worn-out breast and
kisses him, and they sit thus together while the
sickly daylight breaks over the bush.
HENRY LAWSON.
Impossibles.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I HAVE in my fowl-yard a game-cock of extreme
aristocracy, and a hen of very doubtful parentage.
They have no affinity but their difference of sex
and yet they are inseparable. I never look at
them but I think of Harry Westlake—the bright-
faced, whole-1 rear ted heir of Downton Castle,
svho, kicked out from home for general cussedness,
found himself, at the age of twenty-two, in a
selector’s hut, in Gippsland, with Jenny Mogg,
the selector’s daughter, as his only companion.
Jenny was the hen. Harry’s father, having made
neither his will nor his peace with God, died
suddenly in the hunting-field, and the news that
he was a millionaire and the patron of two
■dozen livings, and hereditary Lord-Lieutenant of
his county, came to Harry as he and the girl sat
■on a log together at the back of the hut, and she
had his coat on.
“It’s a bit rough on the old man, Jenny,” he
-said, when he had lead the letter twice aloud to
her, “ that this news should come before the
fencing’s finished. I reckon the boss won’t like
building the shed without me. And what about
the milk? Who’ll carry that down for you—eh !
little woman ?” and he looked up to see a great
tear in each eye of the girl, through which she had
focussed, out of her recollections of Family Hekalu
stories she had read, a picture of the boy’s going—
Downton Castle, welcoming tenants, and lie, her
lover, in uniform. Poor little woman! —right away
there in the wilds of Gippsland, unhampered of
sociology, these two humans, mortared together
by a common diet —of porridge, mostly— without a
dream of severance, had each grown to be a part of
the other, in obedience to an everlasting law
that finds its antithesis in the Shiels Divorce Act.
And now, without warning, there comes this
hideous news— that, like the bursting of a torpedo,
blows the one to an eminence he did not want,
and the other to a Hell she did not deserve.
The next morning Jenny saw him off, and a
•commercial traveller looking down from the box-
seat saw nothing in tlie face of the girl but the
■calm carved stoicism of heroes who have won
their pedestal.
Harry’s welcome home was of the old English
■order. There were coaches, outsiders, fireworks
and a big feed for the tenantry; but the boy
was not himself. He went about the estate
and tried to make himself agreeable, but the
heart of him was right away in Gippsland,
and Jenny had it in tow. And she, little
bundle of uncultured impetuosity as she was, had
for four years thrown the pebbles of her protest
against the “ divine order ” until one morning she
carried her weary head to the hill-top to “ think
things out.”
There are times in the pottery o f nations when
young countries are being kiln-dried, and Austra-
lia that morning was simmering and sweating in
the process. From the plains below the rising
mist danced in the great heat, and the earth pal-
pitated beneath the blows of a vertical sun thresh-
■ ing moisture out. Sheep with their tongues
; hanging came about the girl unafraid, and her own
■ heart was ci’acking like the soil around.
But for the Victorian Education Act, which
denies to the State-taught the sweet privilege of
groaning biblically, the girl might have said with
Job : “ My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct,
the graves are ready for me.” As it was, hemmed
in with the limited vocabulary of a Gippsland
dialect, she could only mutter again and again,
“ My word, ain’t I miserable !” Suddenly a hand
■was placed upon her shoulder and she looked up
to see, not her lover, nor the man who had carried
milk home and eaten damper, but the lord of the
manor, the English squire, in knickerbockers;
and he, looking down, saw, not the companion of
■other days that he for four years had decked in
the fancy-dress of his own imagining, but a young
woman with coarse features, large red hands, and
a mouth wide open witli astonishment. Truth is
the essence of things hideous made actual, and
these amateurs in life’s methods, there on the
bill-top that morning, took their first big gulp of
it. The pair of them—he on the ancestral couch,
and beneath eider-down, she from the corn-
sack nailed over a home-made stretcher, had built
of crude wishings a mighty column of things
possible, on a foundation of day-dreams ; and now
the whole structure tumbles about their ears, as
they shake hands and talk—of the weather.
Presently they strolled home, drank “ post and
rails ” and ate Johnny cake, and the boss that
night, in honour of the occasion, opened a bottle
of “colonial beer.” As he blew the froth from his
glass, looking at the soft hands of the young
squire, he said : “ You’d make a poor fist at
fencing now I reckon, young ’un.” And Harry,
half in jest and half in earnest, replied :
“ Lend me an old suit to - morrow and pil
show yon I haven’t lost much of it,” i
when he awoke on the morrow the pattern of th
paper and the rattle of milk-cans awoke the oi l
spasm in him. Behind the door there
suit of corduroys ; in these he decked himself a n ,|
left the room and his squiredom behind him witl
his Norfolk suit. And Jenny, who, for fear . J
waking the stranger, had walked so gingerly" i lle *
him in the passage and saw that Time had
“harked back” and the heart of her gave\
mighty “ view halloa” as she saw they were on th'a
old scent again.
That morning’s fencing was an idyll punctuated
with laughter and hyphened with kisses. They
paired in the morticing of a post to talk of
days, and the little woman was never sad but
when ho spoke of England, the women there and
hateful incidents of their separation. Thou
Harry would kiss her cracked lips, and fondle her
plenteous hands, and promise that she too should
s ee and share it all if only she would.
And so (to adopt a convenient and helpm]
phraseology) it came to pass that Harry took his
sweetheart to London and left her in lodgings
while he ran down to the country to tell the
neighbours of the pearl of great price that he had
recovered and make due preparations for the
wedding.
A week before the day appointed a great longhm
took hold of the girl to see her future home, amf
in the disguise of her old Gippsland dress, she
started late in the afternoon for Downton Castle.
And that night, while Harry in the smoking-rooni
of his ancient home raved to his cousin of his girl
and her sweet Australian innocence, she, the girl
herself, was peering from the covert of the woods
at the noble entrance—the iron-spiked gate half-
lowered and the lily pond on the lawn. And then
a cold sense of loneliness rose about her like a
clammy fog, and a dread of days to come—women
are all impressionists—and she, Whistler-like, had
in one moment dashed across the clean canvas of
her prophetic vision a picture of the future-
discordant, incongruous, hideous, and dimmed it
with her tears.
In the morning the old habit, still in full
possession, drove Harry out before the servants
were awake; and he strolled towards a swamp
where moorhens lived. “We, Jenny and I, will
fence this in,” he told himself; “if we get miser-
able —and build a hut in the covert there—and
make a little Gippsland of it, where we can eat
damper, we will.” And now he was by the
water’s side, and there, among the broad, flat
leaves of the lilies, lay Jenny herself. Her up-
turned face had lost its coarseness; her hands
toned down by cold water and the refining influ-
ence of death, were almost lady-like ; and a dab-
chick, disturbed by his approach, dived rather
than witness the boy’s sorrow.

Tom's Old Wife.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There was a dead sikncj at the Orchard Farm
when Tom Morison announced to his mother and
■'sisters that he was going to marry Christina
Cram—she was generally called Kristy Cram.
There was nothing against the woman but her age.
She was good enough looking (for her age);
she was a splendid housewife, having done for
her brother Geordie, for 20 years. But Tom was
25 and Kristy just 22 years older ! Mrs. Mori-
son and she had attended the same day-school
tuid afterwards the same finishing classes in
Edinburgh. A man may not marry his mother;
I believe the law also extends to the grandparents (
but there is no law, canonical or civil, against
Joining your fortunes to your mother’s friend and
von temporary.
Miss Cram had nursed Johnny and had given
him “sweeties,” She had often stayed at The
Orchard in times of sickness or gaiety. The
children looked upon her asan aunt. But latterly,
she stayed at her own place, The Whins. Tom
often went over to see her, when he could get
away fr&fn the farm, and met girls there invited
to be thrown in his way. None of them for him,
however. Gradually Christina saw a change in
Tom’s behaviour and wondered what was wrong.
>V hen she heard his tale she cried with laughter,
but promised not to tell, and for a time Tom
visited her no more. And now a wonder came to
light. In his absence she fell in love ivith Tom .
Von laugh. You sneer. You say, absurd I But
not always the absurd that occurs in life ?
m hen they next met it was at Tullibody Fair.
Tom on his big bay half bred, Kristy in the
Whins’ gig driven by sober Sandy Scobie. And
While Tom stammered “good-day” Kristy
blushed like a girl. Think of the ages ! Tom 2',
Kristy 47. I have seen heaps of love at 47, but up
to Christina’s date always on the male side.
Absurd or not they were married ; Tom let The
Orchard to his mother, Kristy did the same with
The Whins, Geordie from the Big Stone, her own
brother, becoming the tenant. Then they came to
Australia, Many mistakes were made by waiters,
stewards, fellow-passengers and others. But Tom
never laughed or got angry when his wife was
vailed his sister, aunt or mother. The quiet
dignity of Mrs, Morison, stopped the babblers
who began to praise her handsome son. At
Melbourne trouble came. They stopped at a
private place whilst Tom looked for a farm to buy
or rent. Why, oh ! why, do people not mind
their own business ?
In the office of an agent, a snob who had come out
with them was relating with glee how a young man
married to a hag of GO had been in the saloon with
him. Evidently married for her money; old
enough to be his grandmother; thrown away for
life ; and his name is Morison. But that was the
last word the man ever spoke. A lucky or un-
lucky blow behind his ear had stopped his gossip,
muffled his clapper and ended his chatter for over.
The great criminal lawyer could not talk Tom
off. The evidence of the blow was clear, though
the provocation was immense. The jury dis-
agreed. At the next assize a second jury failed to
agree, but at the third time of asking the verdict
was “ guilty of manslaughter with a strong re-
commendation to mercy.”
Oh! wise judge! Oh just judge! Merciful
chances and happy fortune ! A man on the Bench
to save a man ! The sentence was so light as to
be nominal, but the shock killed Mrs. Morison,
She is buried with the other Morisons in Tulli-
body churchyard, a resting-place where curious
effitaphs and stones delight the antiquary. In
the old church, disused since the hideous barn was
built close by for a newer service, in that old
building is a tablet with a strange legend :
“C.M.” and beneath these initials “I loved my
old wife,”
SGOTTY THE WRINKLER.
The Lay of the Swagman.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the curlew’s lone whistle was heard in the. land,
And wild-duck were seen o’er the river’s white sand ;
When the at night came down from the height
And harassed the sheepfold with ravenous bite ;
When runs were unfenced and shearing commenced,
When labour was scarce and well-recompensed,
Then I ween the next trump at the new woolshed camp
Was not reckoned a scamp, a sundowning scamp—
Never so, years ago.
When railways and rabbits were unknown out here,
A nd grass was as long as carriage was dear,
The teamster’s long waggon, eight horses to pull,
Came up with the rations, went down with the wool ;
Earned more than a wage at the end of each stage,
And put by a trifle to help in old age.
Now, his share of the oyster that grows on the shore v
Is the covering shell, just the shell, nothing more—
Never so, years ago.
When Unions were weak as the light before morn,
And shearers were paid what they asked for the shorn,
The man with the swag was considered a wag
If he asked at the pub., “ Can you put up my hag ?’’
When he comes now to town, no cheque to knock down,
They judge by his togs he’s not worth a crown ;
He stands in the damp outside by the lamp,
And is reckoned a tramp, a sundowning scamp—
Never so, 3 ears ago.
TVCHO.
Dear Bulletin, — I differ greatly from your
judgment of George C. Levey’s “Australian
Cyclopaedia.” It is, I admit, “ a compact handy-
book,” but when that is said all is said. Asa
work of reference it is worthless—even the London
Lit uauy Journal, which is so remarkable an
anti o .ty on Australian matters that it recently
desc 'ioed a wallaby as “a female kangaroo,” can
poin; out defects in it. The first condition re-
quired from a compiler of a book of reference is
that he should be able to discriminate between so-
calle r “ Authorities,” and as Levey, for the major
portion of his book, has depended upon Henniker
Heaton’s “Dictionary of Dates,” it is not sur-
prising his pages bristle with blunders. Even
where Levey has gone for his facts to those really
splendid compilations, Greville’s “Year Book”
and the “ Australian Hand Book ” of Gordon and
Gotch (I have never written a line for either book,
so cannot be suspected of giving any of mv own
work the puff oblique), the transferred information
is mutilated by gross errors of the press. I have
made of the “ Cyclopaedia ” a two hours’ examina-
tion, and in that time marked between three and
four hundred inaccuracies of date and fact, while
as to the selection of matter, the less said the
better. No portion of the contents shows original
research on Levey’s part. The volume, in short,-
is a rechauffe of some good material spoilt in the
re-dishing, the mess being further tainted by
copied inaccuracies. The compiler’s claim that
the work is to date is wholly indefensible as
to much of the information, and both Hayter and
Coghlan would, I am convinced, repudiate any
responsibility for the statistics as they now appear.
Here are a score of blunders taken at random,
many in the first thirty pages “ Bichend,”
given as a Tasmanian town, you will find on no
map. It should be “Bicheno;” so “ Balmorali ”
should be “Balmoral;” “Bowden,” given as the
founder of the V.D.L. settlement, should be
“Bowen.” Assume these are typographical mis-
takes, what of such carelessness of treatment as
marks the paragraphs on “ Banks (Sir Joseph),”
“Sir ‘Jordan’ for ‘Gordon’ Bremer?” Colonel
Barney is mentioned for a failure at settlement,
for lle Was not responsible, and all his really
great engineering works are not alluded to. The
ope fact which justifies Saxe-Bannister’s name
being included in a work of this miscellaneous
character —his opposition to the Torture In-
demnity Bill—is omitted. “ The reforms in con-
vict administration,” consequent oil Bigge’s re*
ports, which Levey specially honours by mention-
■ ing—what were they ? No one can tell. The idea
that Barrington wrote the prologue which includes
the famous lines, “True patriots,” &c., has long
since been abandoned. “George Bruce” is re-
ferred to, but the remarkable romantic episode
associated with his name is not related —because
Heaton didn’t know it. The “article” on the
“Boomerang” would disgrace a State school
infant whose reading books give a later scientific
explanation of the weapon than Levey supplies.
Under “Boat” you learn that “the first boat
built in N.S.W. was The Rosehill Packet, in
1818(1). Turn to page 337, and yon will get a
reference to The Rosehill Packet under “Ship,”
with the date of 1789. Both items are cribbed as
they stand from Heaton, and both as they stand
in Heaton, are inaccurate. Levey, however, is
above being consistent with himself —compare, for
instance, the various historical references to wool
and sheep, and reconcile them if you can. If the
Age editorial staff is mentioned (in order to give
G. C. Levey’s name prominence) why should not
the Argus men have similar treatment? The
allusions to Federation are ludicrously incorrect,
and it is a lucky thing for Levey’s publishers that
D’Ewes (mis-spelt in the book), the magistrate
concerned in the Eureka business, is dead. And
as to the missions—but, hang it all! I can’t take
up your whole space ! Only let me ask why, above
all men, Wentworth should be left out? The
“Cyclo.” is an instance of how a capital idea may
be spoilt in execution--Levey should confine him-
self to editing a dictionary of'the swear-words he
uses.-
PRICE WARUNG.
i Warner Francis .Tulin Plantagenet Hast-
ings, who has just done our Sir Salmon Wi] SO n
the favour of becoming his son-in-law, is thnf
luckless wight, a landless lord. lie is the lineal
descendant of the gentleman whom Shakespeare
has immortalised as the last protector of
Shore, upon whom King Richard did summary
execution : y
Off with his head. Now, by St: Paul, 1 swear
I will not dine until I see it done.
But a newer lustre gilds the family laurels. When
the tenth Earl died in 1789, without issue, the
estates went to the Countess of Moira, and the
Earldom was believed to be dormant. It turned
out, however, that a disreputable, drunken
scandalous-old country clergyman, the Reverend
Thcophilus Henry Hastings, from whose idiosyn-
cracies Thackeray drew the character of the elder
Sir Pitt Crawley, was a lineal descendant of the
second Earl of Huntingdon who died in 15go
nearly 250 years before. Greatly to the horror of
this worthy parson’s relations he declined either
to claim the title himself or to die and give them a
chance. He had made just such a connection as
Sir Pitt Crawley, in his latest days, did with
Betsy Horrock, but lie had married the dotih ful
lady. To the entreaties of his kinsfolk he in-
variably answered: “Wot, make ould Betty
a Countess? Maw. Not I.'’ When Betty
herself urged him to “ stick ' .flop fer his
roights,” he always said, “ Naw, I’ve made thee
an honest ’oonian, but I’m damned if I make thee
a peeress.” This dreadful old man lived on for
nearly thirty years, barring the way all the tiuw
and it was not until 1819 that his nephew suc-
ceeded in establishing his claim and taking (fig
seat as eleventh earl. But from that day to tins
the title has been barren, and nothing was more
common in the early sixties than to see the
twelfth earl sponging on the Dublin stationers
for “two large cards, because Lord Hastings
(his son, the late earl) was going to the levee.”
to which it was that young nobleman’s habit to
proceed upon an jaunting car, fare sixpence. On
the whole, the Knight of Ercildouno is to pay
dearly for his connection with the peerage. His
son gains nothing in particular by his marriage
with the sixth and youngest daughter of the late
Duke of Marlborough, and his daughter will cer-
tainly have the honour of re-gilding the Hunting-
don coronet, while he himself has just been
informed that the Conservatives‘will not make
any gentleman a peer until he has spent .£40,000
in furthering the interests of the party. Up to
the present time lus expenditure in this direction
is computed at £23.000, so the Victorian sheep-
breeder with the flame-coloured whiskers has
£l7,ooomore to spend ere his claim can be enter-
tained. If be spends it on this coming election
and Gladstone beats his friends, he will be further
off than ever when all is done.
