A MONO the many interesting antiqui-
ties to be found in Eire are the
famous Round Towers, a peculiar class
of circular edifices which taper from the
base to a conical top which may be any-
thing from sixty to one hundred and
thirty- two feet in height. Out of the one
hundred and twenty towers which at one
time existed throughout Ireland, only
about twenty now remain in an almost
perfect state of preservation. The origin
and purpose of these Round Towers has
been the subject of a great deal of con-
troversy, but it is now generally con-
ceded that they were first built by the
early Christian missionaries between the
Bth and 12th centuries A.D. for the pur-
pose of safety and defence. In Irish
Annals and other ancient authorities they
are referred to by the name of “Cloig-
theach” (house of a bell).
The Towers, which were always erected
near a church or monastery, apparently
served a threefold purpose; as a belfry,
watchtower and temporary place of re-
fuge for the monks with their treasures
from raiders until the local population
could rally to their rescue.
The Round Tower of Ardmore, shown
in this picture, is one of the latest in
Ireland, and it is therefore in a good state
of preservation. It is 98 feet in height
and is remarkable in having its floors
indicated by decorative bands on the out-
side walls. The tower stands near the
pleasant little summer resort of Ard-
more in County Waterford. Ardmore
was founded by St. Declan, an early
apostle (600-650) whose oratory, a primi-
tive hut nine feet by thirteen feet, is still
standing, though tke original door is
blocked. A slate roof was added to this
tower in 1716. Nearby is St. Declan’s
grave in the vicinity of the cathedral, an
ancient building many times repaired and
altered. The nave dates from the 11th
century and is in the Irish-Romanesque
style, while the choir is Gothic, dating
from the 13th century.
The castle which stood near the town
was occupied by Perkin Warbeck and was
destroyed after the siege of 1642, when
117 of its defenders were hanged.

PRICHARD v. PRICHARD.
Katharine Susannah Prichard’s Golden
Miles (Cape; Australasian Publishing
Co.) continues the story of the Westralian
goldfields begun in The Roaring Nineties .
It is, principally, a large heap of words.
This is not the warmest commendation
one could give to a novel, yet no sizeable
mound of words, piled with toil and sin-
cerity, is lightly to be dismissed. And
Golden Miles is a very large heap indeed ;
jumbled, intractable, formidable, for-
bidding ; and for that reason challenging.
There can be no question about the
toil that must have gone into it —the labor
of historical research that has carried the
story from the early goldrushes through
the Great War period to the various in-
dustrial troubles of the ’twenties, and the
still greater labor of dragging through that
mass of historical information the group
of nonentities and dullards whose poli-
tical and domestic virtues have led
Katharine Prichard, for political reasons,
to choose them as her central characters.
When the attempt is made to present
Sally Gough, wind-worn, work-worn and
ineffably domestic, as sprightly and
vivacious and still attractive in middle-
age to the gallant Frisco de Morfe, when
the Frenchwoman named Marie merrily
says “Oh! La la!” —and never says any-
thing else of any consequence—and,
above all, when the character named
Dinny Quin is alleged to chuckle, to
gurgle, to warble and to burble while
uttering grievances against mine-
managers and capitalists or reciting
statistics about as joyful as the Common-
wealth Year-Book, one cannot be
charmed, one cannot join in a warble, but
the novelist’s labor does not go un-
regarded ; nor even, up to a point, un-
admired.
The same may be said of the sincerity
of the novel. There is, it is true, the
matter of divided loyalties to be con-
sidered, Golden Miles is essentially a
propaganda novel, and while it is not to
be laid down as an axiom that an artist
cannot write with a social purpose and
remain an artist —or else one would have
to dismiss the whole field of satirical
fiction from Don Quixote to Nicholas
Nickleby —it is quite certain that the
novelist who would remain an artist must
give prime consideration to the require-
ments of art: to' the delineation and
dramatisation of character, to simple en-
tertainment. Katharine Prichard as a
novelist, after the fine achievement of her
early books, has been fighting a long and
losing battle with Katharine Prichard as
a propagandist. She has not remained
the artist, giving her first loyalty to her
art, but has divided herself, as it were,
into two personalities, the novelist and
the propagandist; and while these are at
war, contradicting each other on every
second page of Golden Miles, it is the
propagandist who speaks the louder and
the more often.
One is expected in Golden Miles to
read —and presumably with that delight
which a work of art inspires—drab,
humorless, unnatural dialogue such as
this:
“Early this year,” Tom went on, “all
branches of the Federated Miners in the
West decided to join the A.W.U., become
a branch of that union. All except the
Coolgardie branch. It’s been practically
dead for years: didn’t have a sufficient
membership to vote itself out of existence
even, when other branches joined the
A.W.U. An attempt was made to organise
a General Workers’ Union to counteract
miners’ amalgamation with the A.W.U. The
A.W.U. opposed registration of the new
union in the Federal Arbitration Court, on
the ground that the A.W.U. covered
workers on the goldfields. The Coolgardie
union was dragged out, and a branch set
up in Boulder to become the mouthpiece
of anti-working-class interests on the field.”
And, reading such stuff, one cannot pos-
sibly applaud Katharine Prichard as an
artist. There is not the remotest possi-
bility of such a passage, or the novel as
a whole, tempting anyone who cares for
art into approval of the Leftist formula
on which the book is written. Rather,
one wonders, astounded, how any artist
could surrender to a creed in which art
is the first casualty and of which the
result, plain before the eyes, is a per-
vading and overwhelming dullness. The
only thing to be said, searching for a
justification, is that these things are im-
portant to Katharine Prichard; that her
novel, as a propaganda novel, is sincere.
An honest viewpoint, forcibly expressed,
may still command rfespect, even while
one differs fundamentally from it in
politics and deplores its effect in art.
But these considerations —the mass of
words, the toil, the political sincerity —
are extraneous to a strictly literary
appraisal. A steam-shovel can pile up a
mass of rubble, and doubtless, if one
looked deeply into their souls, steam-
shovels are sincere. They have energy
and an undeviating purpose. But they are
not artists. They do not write novels.
Whether Golden Miles is a novel —a
work of creative art —is open to question.
It is essentially a history of the trade-
union movement on the Westralian gold-
fields. It is a mass of technicalities and
statistics, of union politics and Leftist
propaganda—stuff which conceivably
could be the raw material for a novel and
among which, distantly and dimly, forms
and movements, or half-forms and broken
movements, may be discerned. It is a
battleground where a novelist struggles
with a propagandist.
There is something indomitable about
art: it will not be ground out of exist-
ence by any steamroller of ideology. And
there is something indomitable about the
artist in Katharine Prichard; after all,
she continues to write; and sometimes,
in flashes, uncertainly, to write as a
novelist.
If the propagandist, concerned only
With the wrongs of the workers, writes
on page 73 of the “dreary monotony” of
life in the mines, and on page 78 that the
only relief from the monotony is that
“some days are worse than others,” mak-
ing a picture of gloom and despair in
which the men, one and all, are (on page
83) “doomed and damned,” the novelist,
concerned with human truth, deals on
page 81 with the magnificent acts, of
heroism performed in the mines when
accidents occur and on page 95 with the
simple comedy of racing cockroaches.
If the propagandist asserts on page 86 —
“A man had to have his beer and keep
on working to get more beer. If the
miners didn’t get their beer where would
the mining industry be? The bosses saw
to it there was plenty of beer, even if it
was only the poor chemically doctored
stuff servled nowadays”—the novelist, later
on, shows even Sally Gough enjoying a
beer in a pub without actually having it
forced down her neck by the un-
scrupulous bosses of the mining industry.
If the propagandist would, presumably,
abolish all villainy from the earth and
correct all failure, the novelist, while yet
there is time, makes four interesting
characters —the only humanly interesting
people in her novel —out of villains and
failures: the get-rich-quick Paddy Cavan,
the ne’er-do-well Frisco, the halfcaste
Maritana and the dejected undertaker
Morrie Gough.
If the propagandist would lead the story
into a desert of arid argument, the
novelist insists on two themes of human
interest and of dramatic possibility: the
murder of Maritana, probably at the in-
stigation of Paddy Cavan, and the conflict
between Morrie Gough and his unionist
son Tom on the question of conscription
in the 1914 war.
Here, in these flashes of human truth,
these touches of genuine characterisation
and these inklings of drama, there is
something legitimately to be admired
from a literary viewpoint. But admira-
tion cannot be more than moderate.
The propaganda smothers the
humanity. The dramas are imperfectly
developed. Frisco, when at long last,
Morrie having died, he comes to the arms
of Sally Gough, is disappointing as a
more-or-less reformed character. Paddy
Cavan is a little too much like a Com-
munist newspaper’s cartoon of a capi-
talist for complete credibility. Maritana
makes only a brief appearance; and
Morrie Gough, who, as an Englishman
fallen in the world, bears some (pre-
viously noted) resemblance to Richard
Mahony, and who is more satisfactorily
portrayed than any of the other char-
acters, illustrates how sketchy is the char-
acterisation as a whole: for of the centre
of his daily life, his experiences in the
peculiarly interesting profession of under-
taking, there is not a word. From an
artistic as distinct from a trade-union
point of view, one chapter on Morrie
Gough as an undertaker might well have
been more valuable than the whole 386
pages of this immense and lumbering
political manifesto.
The patches of fictional interest are not
large enough, long enough or deep enough
to make Golden Miles successful as a
novel. One is left to evaluate the work as
a history. A history, like a novel, should
be a work of art: Golden Miles is over-
crowded with detail and told in that tone
of naive enthusiasm adopted by country
newspapers on the occasion of local
centenaries. A history should be de-
tached : Golden Miles is propagandist.
It is not that one doubts Katharine
Prichard’s statistics about phthisis or gold
production. It is not that, having an
opposite political viewpoint, one would
wish to argue that the mining industry has
invariably been conducted by philanthro-
pists. Even if all poor men are not as
noble nor so much put-upon as Katharine
Prichard would like to portray them,
rich men and mine-managers also have
their faults. But, virtuous or villainous,,
they do, surely, exist; and no rich man
except Paddy Cavan and no mine-
manager exists as a character in Golden
Miles. Katharine Prichard is banging the
heads of phantoms. The emptiness of the
fight weakens the structure of the novel;
the lack of balance makes it utterly un-
reliable as a history.
One does not need to call up the absent
“bosses” and mine-managers, belabored
and vilified throughout the book, to speak
in their own defence. Much of what is
said against them is so obviously non-
sensical that, instead of accepting the
book with interest as the detached voice
of history, one is forced to brush it aside
as mere propaganda. ’Consider, for in-
stance, the statement made by Dinny Quin
on page 21:
Precious little the people who live here’ve
got out of all the wealth the mines’ve
produced. The mining companies haven’t
spent a penny to make up for the way
they’ve laid waste the countryside. Any com-
forts of civilisation we’ve got, in Boulder
City and Kalgoorlie, the people’ve paid for,
and the mine’ve got the benefit of them;
the railway, water-supply and electric light.
Miners’re still livin’ in those rotten humpies
of rusty tin and bagging on Ding Bat flat.
Did y’r ever see a more dreary, poverty-
stricken lookin’ place?
What a political fanatic, a character
in a novel, may say in the course of
argument must, of course, be dis-
tinguished from the opinions of the
author. But if Golden Miles is to be
►regarded as a history one looks in vain
for consideration of the points that it
is hardly fair to castigate the mining
companies for “laying waste the country-
side” and at the same time to demand a
share of their wealth; that the mines,
at least by way of rates and freights, must
have contributed something to the cost
of these undertakings; that the benefits
of railway, water-supply and electric light
must surely have been available to the
townspeople; and that,, in any case, all
the men working at the mine shared in
the advantages thus wickedly and penni-
lessly acquired by the industry which
paid their wages.
Or, rather, one does pot search quite
in vain. The absurd attack is left, for
the most part, unanswered; but on page
22 one finds some boys in a public
swimming-pool, and so, for a brief and
valiant moment once more, Katharine
Prichard the novelist contradicting
Katharine Prichard the propagandist.
Douglas Reed Again .
Douglas Reed’s sequel to his Insanity
Fair, From Smoke to Smother (Cape;
Angus and Robertson), is a sharp, grim
book. But then the period it covers—
-1938-4B—won’t8 —won’t lend itself to fairy-tales.
The author has succeeded with that
difficult formula: the journalistic cover-
age which mixes autobiographical ad-
venture, eyewitnessing of disaster,
prophecy and philosophy. He has met
most of the important men of the past 10
European years, has seen the results of
their work and tells his story with prac-
tised lucidity. His philosophy is sound;
Though lives may be destroyed, life can-
not be, for it eternally renews itself. The
annihilation of spiritual values now seems
to me the most important thing to arrest.
The ones I chiefly mean are religion,
patriotism, liberty, human dignity and
honor.
Reed deftly eases into his book pene-
trating character-studies of the men in
Germany and Russia who, beginning the
process of destroying these values in
the early ’thirties, extended it into the last
war and who, particularly in Russia, are
now continuing it into the “peace.”
He sees in the world today, not exclud-
ing England, a stretching plan to annihi-
late Christian values: stemming from
Russia, a vast mob “gathering round the
flags of anti-Christendom; swastika,
sickle-and-hammer; it was no accident,
but part of the design that both were in
the shape of a broken or distorted cross,
and this revealed their common origin.”
And, to this “plan,” he applies Lord
Acton’s verdict on the French Revolu-
tion :
The appalling thing is not the tumult, but
the design. Through all the fire and smoke
we perceive the evidence of calculating
organisation. The managers remain studi-
ously concealed; but there is no doubt
about their presence from the first.
Through his whole book is threaded his
belief that there is a cohesive link from
the French Revolution, through German
National Socialism and Russian Com-
munism, to the almost universal agitation
threatening peace today.
On Socialism in England, Reed is most
interesting. Returning from Europe after
the war he found the same little commis-
sars and gauleiters, the same whittling of
rights under the all-embracing cry of
“national emergency.”
But, of course, this was England; this
was different. No, says Reed, it was the
same:
The process began with the ominous
words “emergency powers.” At every
level, from Prime Minister to parish pump,
men girded on these emergency powers and
said “I am the State.” Below the Minister
in Whitehall* was the Regional Commis-
sioner, beneath him were smaller despots,
down to the Emergency Committee in the
hamlet. Through this system of pipes,
stealthily laid down under cover of the
war and behind the back of the fighting
man, the poison of power began to circulate
through the body of England.
The size of the machine he saw built,
however, disquieted him less than the fact
that it was obviously being set up for a
permanent political purpose. As, of
course, and remembering our own vastly
increased army of bureaucrats, it was.
Reed sees in the British Socialist Gov-
ernment a body of men who, though once
normal, are now, under the corruption of
power, being pushed irresistibly towards
the brink of Russian totalitarianism by
those expert “managers of the design,”
Communists in control of powerful
trade-unions.
The author’s views on a World State,
particularly in view of Mr. Menzies’s
recent speech in N ewcastle-on-Tyne,
wherein he warned Britons against the
illusion that any international organisa-
tion could be a substitute for the free
association between the British peoples,
are significant. World statesmen are
clamoring for the people to defend their
“freedom” —which, says Reed, is national
sovereignty.
Steeped in the British tradition, imbued
with a belief in the fundamental decency
of democratic ideals, one involuntarily
tends to decry Reed’s warnings, on the
ground that “It can’t happen here.”
Until one realises, with an eye on Malaya,
France, Italy and Berlin, that that is the
most foolish platitude of all.
"A Tale of a Tub."
No page devoted to literary criticism
could let a new edition of Jonathan
Swift’s A Tale of a Tub pass without a
word of commendation, for Swift held
extremely forcible opinions on the tribe
of critics:
There is a serpent that wants teeth, and
consequently cannot bite; but if its vomit
(to which it is much addicted) happens to
fall on anything, a certain rottenness or cor-
ruption ensues. These serpents are generally
found among the mountains, where jewels
grow, and they frequently emit a poisonous
juice: whereof whoever drinks, that per-
son’s brains fly out of his nostrils.
What a savage the old Dean was!
And A Tale of a Tub (now reprinted
by Hamish Hamilton, Ltd., in one volume
with The Battle of the Books) was written
when he was a young man, before he had
fully lost his temper with the world.
One hesitates, naturally, to don the
cap which he provides for the “true
critic,” the mere attacker of great art,
whom he is pummelling and pounding in
the famous digression in A Tale of a
Tub; but a further passage may be quoted
as, wherever It may be applied, salutary:
Pausanias is of opinion, that the perfec-
tion of writing correct was entirely owing
to the institution of critics; and that he
can possibly mean no other than the true
critic is, I think, manifest enough from the
following description. He says, they were
a race of men who delighted to nibble at
the superfluities, and excrescencies of
books; which the learned at length observ-
ing, took warning, of their own accord, to
lop the luxuriant, the rotten, the dead, the
sapless, and the overgrown branches from
their works. But now, all this he cunningly
shades under the following allegory; that
the Nauplians in Argia learned the art of
pruning their vines, by observing that, when
an had browsed upon one of them, it
thrived the better and bore fairer fruit.
Peter Quennell, in his admirable pre-
face to the present volume, is, in one
respect, somewhat in error; where he
suggests that A Tale of a Tub, though
still more than readable for its ferocious
wit and its occasional bursts of the pure
high spirits that always made Swift a
tolerably companionable scorpion, has
lost topical interest in its central theme
of the “sectarian wrangles of the seven-
teenth century.” The abuses Swift lam-
pooned in all religious denominations
still persist, and there is still a very large
audience, distinct from the connoisseurs
of style, which would read the satire with
a wry smile or with rage.
Mr. Quennell devotes himself, for the
most part, to analysing why we have no
Swift today; no great satirist in a world
never more in need of one. Perhaps, as
he suggests, we have lost the capacity
for indignation; in a supreme act of
cynicism we have sub-edited Gulliver
into an entertainment for children. But
perhaps it is simply that no great writer
so tormented as Swift has happened to
be born among us, to pass on to mankind
that hatred he felt for himself. We have,
at any rate. Swift still with us; in A
Tale of a Tub and, in spite of the sub-
editing, in Gulliver, immortally enchant-
ing, immortally furious.

in both sports meeting was when
wrestler Ray Steele opposed boxer
King Levinsky in St. Louis (U.S.A.)

swung a punch at Steele’s chin, but
he missed, and was dumped, then
shoulders pinned, 35 seconds after the

Best kind of beans for N.S.W.
coastal area and hints on growing
them ?
Brown Betty, New Discovery,
Feltham Prolific and Canadian Won-
der are suitable and heavy croppers.
Trench the soil at least 12in. and give
the area a dressing of lime, followed
two weeks later with rotted manure
and a little blood-and-bone fertiliser.
A fortnight later plant seed 2in. apart
in drills, and allow 2ft. at least be-
tween the rows for hilling-up pur-
poses. When the plants are well
through the soil they must be culti-
vated regularly and the soil kept up
to the stems, and also given plenty
of water. An occasional dusting of
lime over the young plants will check
slugs and snails.

Have there been any instances when
two horses bearing the same name
have run in the same Melbourne
Cup?
In the Melbourne Cup of 1867 two
horses competed bearing the name of
Tim Whifiler. To avoid confusion
they were called Sydney Tim and
Melbourne Tim. The Sydney horse
started favorite at 5 to 2 and won.
The Melbourne horse ran filth. In
1866 two horses named Falcon ran

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Arms Race Is On!
Already the general arms race
is the biggest the world has
known in peace-time, and, states
“U.S. News and World Report”
in a survey of it, it keeps on
gaining momentum.
Russia is put at the head of
the list This must very largely
be guesswork, but, for what it
may be worth as far as Russia
goes, the survey puts the Krem-
lin war-preparation expenditure
at nearly one-fifth of the entire
national income about the
same rate that Hitler extracted
from the Germans during the
’thirties.
The U.S., says the survey, is
spending 7 per cent, of its in-
come on war preparations,
“with the trend upwards.” As it
is, that is about five times as
much of the national income as
was spent for the same purpose
before the war.
Britain is given as spending
“nearly £1 in every £lO of the
national income on arms.” That
would be about twice the rate
that ruled when Britain was
concerned over Hitler’s prepara-
tions ; and it has to be looked
at, too, in the light of Britain’s
present difficulties in making
ends meet.
So it goes with other coun-
tries. The French, though a
weak part of the Western de-
fence, are actually spending
more now in proportion to in-
come than before the war; so
are the Netherlands and Den-
mark. Canada’s rise is from
0.6 per cent, of the national in :
come spent on arms before the
war to 3.5 per cent. now.
The survey concludes:
“Trend in armament is most
strongly upward in U.S. and
Russia. U.S. must arm not only
herself but must help in arm-
ing friendly nations. Over the
year ahead this help is expected
to develop into a revival of
lend-lease on a modified basis.
“U.S. resources are so great
and U.S. industry so efficient
relatively that the effort put for-
ward by U.S. may match or ex-
ceed in effectiveness the arms
effort put forward by Russia.
U.S. effort, plus British effort,
plus the effort of nations outside
Russia’s orbit, is greater in
effectiveness than the Russian
effort,
“Arms races, once started,
have ended in wars in the past if
the cause of the races has not
been removed. On that basis
long-range trend at this time is
toward war.”
Communist Weaknesses
Three weaknesses of Soviet
Communism seen by leading
authority William Henry Cham-
berlin as “likely, in the long
run, not only to hamper its
further progress, but to roll back
some of the advances it made by
exploiting the appeasement
policies of the Western Powers
during the war”:
First, it is shaped too much
in the autocratic Russian image,
which makes too little allowance
for the traditional independence
of thought in countries with
Western traditions. It therefore
relies too much on the effective-
ness of Russian psychological
methods in countries where these
methods are alien.
Second, there is no sure legal
continuity of succession under
the Soviet dictatorship, Stalin’s
death or disability can therefore
unloose a fierce scramble for
power among candidates for the
succession which would be im-
possible in countries which live
under respected Constitutions.
Third, the Soviet leaders are
faced with a contradiction which
is probably insoluble. In order
to maintain the spell of their
propaganda they must keep their
people sealed off from conta-
minating contacts with foreigners.
But such self-imposed isolation
exacts a severe penalty. The
greatest material progress has
always been achieved in an
atmosphere of free competitive
exchange of ideas.
Western Disunity.
The slow progress being made
in getting anywhere with the
“Western European Union” is
worrying American observers,
who fear that, despite the Soviet
menace, Europeans may not be
capable of rising above their
traditional outlook and attitude
towards one another.
They will need, N. Y. “Times”
comments, to “advance far
bolder policies than they have
done thus far to put their own
house in order and cement
Western solidarity.” This is seen
as “taking shape only slowly and
with hesitations which imperil
the desired goal.”
Reporting from Geneva on
the central body working for
Western European co-operation,
a correspondent of the same
well-informed N. Y. newspaper
declares there has been “almost
no advance towards the real ob-
jectives of the Marshall Plan —
the greater permanent economic
integration of Europe, the reduc-
tion of trade barriers, the clean-
ing-up of financial houses and
the establishment of bases for
getting along without American
aid.”
There is, the correspondent
further reports, precious little
evidence that the European
Governments take seriously
their commitments to pool their
resources and energies in the in-
terests of common recovery.
“With discouraging regularity
delegates arrive at the inter-
national meetings candidly ad-
mitting that their only instruc-
tions are to agree to nothing that
will involve changes in their
Governments’ domestic opera-
tions.”
The correspondent gives
Britain the largest share of the
blame: “It is unfortunately true
that the worst offender is the
British Government, to which so
many millions of Europeans
look for leadership in these try-
ing times.” The British, he
adds, are badly divided on the
subject of relations with
Europe: one Parliamentary
group that cuts across party lines
favors European federation;
another thinks of Britain’s rela-
tions with the Commonwealth as
of first importance.
“Europe is frankly mystified
as to what the British Govern-
ment itself thinks. It sees Prime
Minister Attlee shunning con-
tact with groups that are press-
ing for a Western European
Assembly to promote greater
political union while Foreign
Minister Bevin talks about a
‘Western Union.’ The British
civil service can hardly be
blamed if, in the face of this un-
certainty at the top, it takes a
strictly do-nothing attitude.”
On the failure so far to ap-
proach anywhere near the goal,
N. Y. “Times” editorially com-
ments :
“The United States has backed
this goal with the most momen-
tous political undertaking of all
times —the Marshall Plan. But
in the last analysis, the goal can
be reached only by the Euro-
peans themselves. The West-
European nations must first of
all pursue policies which will
establish their own political and
economic stability. The British
Commonwealth must find a
working arrangement with a
Continental federation; all
Western Powers must find a new
relationship with Germany
which will make it a solid part of
the Western bloc, and the small
nations must be assured of suffi-
cient autonomy to avert their
fear of being absorbed by the
bigger Powers.
“All these issues present
problems whose solution is diffi-
cult because of ancient animosi-
ties and economic and cultural
diversities that made Europe
what it is. But unless Europe is
able to solve them within the
period of respite provided by the
Marshall Plan, it faces a future
that is dark indeed.”
Terrorised Germans.
One of the bogeys most fre-
quently paraded in comments on
Europe is that of an eventual
Soviet - German collaboration
against the West —with the Ger-
mans subordinates in the
partnership. Unless Germans
have changed out of all recogni-
tion that would seem as improb-
able as anything could be. And,
as well as the German racial-
historical factors against it, past
and present Russian behavior
might be thought enough to be
decisive.
Thus, a report by Willi
Brandt, Berlin representative of
the Socialist Democratic party,
urges the world to listen to “a
story identical to one it did not
want to heed in the 19305.” The
story describes the reign of
terror in the Soviet zone of
Germany: mass arrests of
youths, deportations of skilled
workers and experts to the Soviet
Union and brutal handling of
other workers and politicians
who did not agree with Russian
occupation policy or the Socialist
Unity (Communist) party objec-
tives.
“We believe that we would
also be guilty if we kept silent
about the occurrences in Eastern
Germany and part of Berlin,”
the Brandt report added. “The
Germans have been reproached
for keeping silent under the
Nazi regime, and we do not want
the same charges to be made
again.
“We ask the rulers of the
Soviet zone why they have not
thus far allowed impartial com-
missions to examine the camps
in their-zone. If the peace aims
of the United Nations are to
have any sense, then this shame
must not be tolerated any longer
by the civilised world.”
The Germans would seem to
be optimists in resting their
hopes on U.N.O. to end the
terror; but at the same time the
Russians’ own actions should be
ample to prevent the feared col-
laboration.
Jap Crossroads.
“Christian Science Monitor’s”
Far East correspondent Gordon
Walker finds the U.S. occupa-
tion of Japan has arrived, after
three years, at a ticklish cross-
road :
“Growing antipathy for the
Americans who are helping to
reform Japan marks the begin-
ning of the fourth year of the
occupation. Much of the earlier
exuberance over an ‘easy’ occu-
pation has worn off. The Jap-
anese believe today they are
being over-reformed.”
The Japs are looking forward
with growing impatience to a
peace treaty and the end of the
occupation; “They want to be
left to handle their own affairs
and to get back what they con-
sider to be their national inde-
pendence. The Japanese, in
short, want the Americans to
close down their school for
applied democracy and return
home,”
The question involved is, as
expressed by Walker, “Has the
occupation reached the point
wherein returns no longer justify
expenditure of money and man-
power?” Walker and many
others associated with the occu-
pation are inclined to answer
“yes”:—
“It is indeed a question
whether reform of Japan could
be carried any further. Never
before in history has so much
been accomplished in a short
time in the way of modernising
a nation’s institutions all the way
from fire departments to Parlia-
ment. Although the Japanese
themselves have not assimilated
much which has been taught
them, the degree of compliance
has been far greater than might
reasonably have been expected.
Now, however, that unusually-
ready acceptance of reform
measures has begun to wane.”
The correspondent observes
further that many power groups
—including some who have re-
ceived power as a result of the
occupation, organised labor, for
instance—have begun to swing
away from the ranks of those
who support occupation policies.
General MacArthur is among
those who believe the thing has
gone far enough, declaring that
Japan “is equipped with the
moral weapons to repel the
totalitarian advance” and “is an
asset upon which the free world
may confidently count.”
However, while most Ameri-
can occupation authorities feel
that in the interest of their desire
for a future “friendly” Japan,
the reform lessons should be
brought to a halt, they are
obliged to consider the attitude
of other interested nations such
as Great Britain, China and the
Philippines, all holding that re-
form has not been carried nearly
far enough.
Summing up, the “Christian
Science Monitor” man observes;
“Thus, the case of Japan now
poses a serious and pressing
problem for American policy-
makers. The coming year in
Japan may well be the testing
ground for America’s future as
a guiding influence in Far
Eastern affairs.”
Deep-sea Discoveries.
For the past 15 months Lon-
don “Times” has allowed its
readers, through a series of
articles by Professor Hans Pet-
tersson, to examine from their
armchairs what lies in those
deep abysses on the sea-bottom
nearest the earth’s centre.
Instruments from the Swedish
Deep-sea Expedition’s motor-
schooner Albatross, now in
London, have plunged down
into the hidden slime of dateless
ages and brought to light—in
some cases, for the first time in
10 million ' years—portions of
the bottom and its depth, scien-
tific analysis of which will help
to determine the presence of
uranium and radium, to build up
a relief map of the ocean floor,
and, by establishing the age of
underwater volcanic deposits
from the Mediterranean, to
throw light on the dates of
eruptions that wrecked ancient
civilisations.
The Albatross’s cruise took
her across the Atlantic, through
the Panama Canal and over
areas covered by that most
•famous of deep-sea surveys, the
Challenger’s between 1872 and
1876. From the Pacific, the
probing fingers of her echo-
sounders and instruments felt
the oozy floors of the Indian
Ocean and Mediterranean, then
again across the Atlantic and
back to London.
The ship’s most prolific
gatherer was a deep-sea trawl-
net whose steel-edged guides,
with the ship under way, bit into
the water like a minesweeper’s
kite and forced' the net down to
record depths of over 5000
fathoms.
Hauled in by a huge winch,
the net brought up rare speci-
mens of deep-living fish, sea-
cucumbers, invertebrate organ-
isms and, in a specially-con-
structed dredge, a number of
manganese nodules. These, of
immense age. Prof. Pettersson
describes as “rather like dirty
potatoes, whose growth may be
seen when one of them is cut
through. The outer structure
consists of concentric shells,
which appear in section some-
what like the rings on a tree-
stump. Their rate of growth,
like all changes on the ocean
floor, is extremely slow. How
slow it has been possible to find
out by radioactive age deter-
mination. A spherical nodule
of the size of a golf-ball is the
product of a growth over a
period of 15,000 years or
more.”
From a part of the North
Atlantic bottom marked on Ad-
miralty charts as “manganese”
the dredge brought up over 300
of these ocean-bed potatoes, as
well as blocks of waterlogged
pumice, heavily encrusted with
manganese oxides, and a num-
ber of ancient sharks’ teeth.
Another instrument is a long,
hollow tube which embeds it-
self in the sediment and brings
up a core of the ocean bed. A
short distance s.-e. of the
“potato patch” the tube gouged
through a 40ft. layer of brown
clay and brought up a mouthful
of snow-white ooze.
The Albatross has confirmed
the great depth of the Romanche
Deep in the Atlantic. Here its
echo-sounder searched down
through the black water, touched
bottom and echoed back to re-
veal a depth of 25,000 ft., nearly
150 fathoms deeper than the last
sounding.
To determine the thickness of
red-clay sediment under its
miles of water the Albatross
dropped over 400 depth-charges.
Echoes were taken from the
ocean bottom and then from the
bottom of the sediment. These
revealed a sediment thickness of
7000 ft., representing an in-
finitesimally slow accretion over
2000 million years.
Investigation into all the data
the expedition has amassed over
15 months will take several
years. When the results of
analysis are finally known Pro-
fessor Pettersson and his team
hope to give the world important
additions to the present com-
paratively meagre knowledge of
its most mysterious part.

If War Comes. Most overseas
commentators take it as read that if
war comes now it will be the old
story of a disastrous beginning, vic-
tory for the West depending on sub-
sequent recovery. A Washington cor-
respondent of N. Y. “Daily Mirror”
quotes former U.S. Ambassador Ad-
miral Leahy as pointing out that the
U.S. has about 300,000 troops in
Europe, only 30,000 of whom are
combat troops, against Russia’s
600,000 men in Germany alone. “He
warned that the U.S. couldn’t hold
the Rhine; couldn’t hold more than
Spain and perhaps Turkey.” He
seems to have overlooked Greece and
Italy; also British and other forces.

Objections to Monty. —Speculating
before Montgomery’s appointment to

They “always have felt that Field-
Marshal Alexander, now Governor-
General of Canada, was a far easier
personality to deal with and probably
a better strategist than Montgomery. ’

not retired, as recently stated; he
returned to Transjordan last month
after a month’s leave in England.
Before returning he adjured the U.S.
and Britain to watch their interests
in the Middle East because, he said,
the Soviet Union was supporting
Israel in aji attempt to gain control
of the whole area. He asserted that

Israel’s British Legacy. N. Y.
“Times” Tel Aviv correspondent
Julian L. Meltzer reports it as certain
that in next month’s elections for the
Israeli Constituent Assembly “State
Socialism more or less identical with
the type governing Britain will re-
ceive decided encouragement,” and
“thereafter a Socialist system will
indubitably develop.” This is a heri-
tage from British mandate control,
under which “organised Socialist prac-
tice was virtually unfettered.” The
active membership of what can be
called the Socialist organisation
(Histadruth) is 170,000, almost one-
half the Jewish adult population.

U.N.O.’s Three Choices. —That re-
doubtable battler against totalitarian-
ism Lord Vansittart, in a London
“Times” letter: “(1) The United
Nations can drift on just as they are.
In that case they will soon be dead,
even for minor purposes, for the spirit
will be taken from all men of good-
will. (2) They can resort to ‘struc-
tural alterations’ with Russia’s con-
sent. This will be impracticable so
long as the Kremlin’s aims and
methods are maintained. Mr. Vyshin-
sky’s speech in Paris showed there
is no change either in manner or
matter. (3) They can resort to struc-
tural alterations without the Kremlin’s
consent. If the Soviet Government
then elected to withdraw, ‘half a loaf
is unalterably better than no bread,
and so far we have only been given
a stone.’ We can hardly be worse
off if the Kremlin leaves a club which
it has done its best to wreck.”

DOWN BUT NOT OUT.
One careless political and newspaper
misjudgment j s being repeated by
people who know little, and accepted by
people who should kno>v better, is that
Britain is no longer a first-class Power.
What is implied by the term “first-class
Power”? If it means a nation that is
capable of licking all-comers with one
hand tied behind its back, then there has
never been such a thing since the days
of Rome —and even Rome at its greatest
followed the policy of “divide and rule,”
and fell at last when enough of the bar-
barian races banded together against her.
A more likely definition would be a Power
of sufficient strength to resist successfully
the attack of any other Power, or, better
still, to deter any other Power from
attacking her. Yet consideration of the
world situation immediately prior to the
first Great War shows that strength of
even that magnitude was not in the minds
of writers and statesmen when they spoke
of first-class Powers.
By common acceptance there were five
Great Powers in Europe in 1913 —Britain,
France, Germany, Austria-Hungary and
Russia —and there was no pretence that
all were of equal strength. Of the five,
Britain alone, with the exception of the
South African campaign and colonial
troubles, had avoided single-handed war
since Waterloo, and of the others only
Germany was undefeated. Austria had
been overwhelmed by Germany in 1866,
and France was defeated almost as easily
in 1870; yet both were still recognised
as Great Powers. Nor had Russia’s de-
feat in 1905 at the hands of Japan, a
Johnny-come-lately Power, affected her
“Great” status. Italy was still in the
process of finding her feet as a nation,
and America, till then accustomed to
standing aside from European arguments,
was consequently not taken into con-
sideration in Power groupings.
The Kaiser’s war brought about radical
changes in the ratings. After Versailles,
Britain and France were paramount in
Europe. Austria (permanently) and Ger-
many (temporarily) had abdicated claims
to Greatness, and Russia, in the throes of
revolution and its bloody aftermath, could
for the time be left out of the reckoning.
Italy and Japan, the up-and-coming
thrusters of the earlier period, had been
grudgingly conceded front-row status;
and America, although after her first ex-
perience of European battlegrounds she
had repudiated President Wilson and
pulled up the drawbridge of her Ivory
Tower, had certainly to be thenceforth
considered an important factor in world
affairs. The World Powers, then—the
term replaced the Great Powers of before
1914 —\yere Britain, U.S.A., France, Italy
and Japan. As in the case of the Greats,
thert was no suggestion that all were of
equal strength. Indeed, the Washington
Treaty of 1922 laid down a definite scale
by which their future naval strength
could be measured —Britain and America,
of equal strength, were each to have an
advantage over Japan in the proportion
of 5 : 3, and France and Italy were
each to have an equal naval strength
slightly more than half that of Japan.
The gradings of the 1920 s did not last
long. By the mid-thirties Germany was
once again a Power to be reckoned with ;
France, through years of muddled in-
ternal politics, had lost some of the stand-
ing she had immediately after Versailles ;
Italy and Japan, still thrusting, had
climbed a few rungs on the international
ladder; and Russia, from a welter of
plans and purges, was emerging as a
Power of unknown strength and unpre-
dictable actions, and the spawning-ground
of an idea which, distorted and ethe-
realised into a religion, had devotees in
every land.
The Second World War cut a swathe
through the World Power ranks. Ger-
many, for the moment, does not exist;
Japan, shorn of the conquests of half a
century and confined to the home islands,
must postpone until another day her
dreams of expansion. Italy, the country
of second thoughts, is for the time being
a makeweight rather than a decisive
factor in international affairs, and
France’s voice, when it is raised at all, is
more distraught than in pre-war days. The
“Big Five,” beloved expression of popular
journalism in the first days of U.N.0., is
no longer spoken of—its fifth member,
China, having turned out to be still more
of a geographical expression than a World
Power.
Of the Big Five, then, there remain but
three —Britain, U.S.A. and Russia, with
the United States undoubtedly the
strongest. At the war’s end U.S. armed
forces in all three services, although dis-
persed over half the globe, aggregated a
greater strength than those of any nation
in history; in industry, both in produc-
tion and potential, the United States stood
unchallenged. Added to which, of course,
she had the atom-bomb. Russia today is
a giant sprawling across two continents,
clutching her easy conquests in uneasy
hands. Her strength is difficult to assess ;
much of it is weakness in disguise.
The loose thinkers find it hard to fit
Britain into this picture. Counting heads,
they cannot conceive how Britain can
any longer hope to treat on terms of
equality with America and Russia, each
with three or four times her population.
That method of assessing strength is fal-
lacious. Britain’s strength has never de-
pended on superiority in numbers. At
no time, for instance, during the many
wars with France did the English popu-
lation exceed that of France; that posi-
tion was reached only in the last half-
century.
It is .no new discovery that the British
Isles are too small and their resources too
scanty to house, clothe and feed in com-
fort all the British people. Ever since the
New World was discovered a proportion
of Britons has sought a living abroad.
The many generations of British people
who have sailed the seas, traded with far
shores and founded new colonies half a
world away, did not leave their homeland
merely for love of fun and adventure.
The simple and understandable reason
for their going was to provide a better
standard of living, a higher degree of
comfort, for themselves and their families.
Hence Australia and New Zealand,
Canada and South Africa ; hence Britain’s
mighty merchant fleet; hence also the
oversea investments, largely sacrificed in
fighting Freedom’s battle alone, which
represented the surplus of the fruits of
British endeavor and enterprise.
The loose thinkers, in writing-off Britain
as a spent force, sometimes concede
that there may perhaps be a place in the
front rank for the British Commonwealth
of Nations, as though the idea of the
British family of nations, presenting a
united front were something new. One
of the latest to voice that thought, as a
postscript to an epitaph on Britain as a
first-class Power, was Federal Minister
Dedman.
In modern times Britain’s power and
importance have never come solely from
the British Isles. The United Kingdom
has been the solid core of strength, as in
the war it was the centre of resistance
and the spring of inspiration, but, always
in the picture have been the other Britains
beyond the seas —Dominions and colonies
—always, too, on the earth’s broad
oceans, thousands of ships, like so many
British islands scattered around the globe.
In these always has lain the real strength
of Britain, and these still remain—and
with them remains the British spirit, un-
defeated and undismayed, even by the era
(now passing) of Socialist government, as
anyone who has visited the Old Country
recently will testify.
Baffled Socialist.
With every repetition of his appeals to
“the workers” for more production, Mr.
Chifley goes a step further in writing the
death-warrant of his Ministry. He has
stated as plainly as any private employer
that greater output of goods and services
-—a return to hard work, as he expressed
it in his last appeal but two—is vital to
Australia’s economic health and the main-
tenance of the standard of living. By
now he has made obvious that the
achievement of greater production is
beyond him.
The unions will work for him no more
than anyone else. His Socialist planning
won’t work, either; it refutes all ideas of
hard work. The country is falling into a
stagnant state of development and a re-
luctance to combat it, which quite plainly
spell catastrophe, Mr. Chifley and the
“Labor” party affect to regard such com-
ment as propaganda against themselves.
But it is much more than that; and Mr.
Chifley’s own growing desperation is be-
trayed in word and action. “The imper-
turbable” has plainly become rattled,
Mr. Lang, a caustic and unrelenting
adversary if ever there were one, has
given him some fighting advice. It
is to tell the unions that, unless they obey
him and compel their members to work
harder, he will hand in his Ministry’s
resignation. That is undoubtedly the
correct political stand by any Prime
Minister in Mr. Chifley’s position, and it
is, by “Fixer” Ashley’s admission, the
course which at the coming elections the
country will assuredly decide for him
unless he can restore production ancj
confidence. “Only ‘Labor’ can stop
strikes; only ‘Labor’ can get coal,” ran
the Chifley party’s election slogan. The
socialisation policy has made claptrap of
that.
Five other Ministers attended the con-
ference (which was held in camera) with
Mr. Chifley, for the A.C.T.U. and other
union delegates (including the local Com-
munists’ Commissar for Industry) had a
bargain to drive in respect of any lifting
of limitations upon output they might
consider. Following Mr. Chifley’s now-
hackneyed appeal for more production,
questions were asked by industrial dele-
gates ; and from these, and from pre-
conference statements by the president of
the A.C.T.U. and other Trades Hall
officials, the assurances sought by the in-
dustrial wings—Trades Hall and Com-
munists —of political “Labor” may be
defined. They include:
More socialisation of industry, including
nationalisation of the coalmines (which
Mr. Chifley has rejected as uneconomical).
The taking-over, particularly, of any in-
dustry which should put off workers if a
depression comes.
Reduction of imports and enforced limi-
tation of home production “if production
reaches the stage when there are surpluses.”
(The criterion of such a state would be the
expiry of blackmarkets.)
Strict, pegging of prices of all goods
regardless of the rising cost of labor.
Commonwealth Government “assistance”
of the Arbitration Court in the unions’
demand for a basic-wage rise of 265. in one
hit. (The basic wage has risen 4s. in the
average of capital cities in the last six
months.)
Enforced cessation of “the employers
campaign” against the 40-hour week (that
is, against reduced output).
Amendment of the Arbitration Act to
require Conciliation Commissioners to
ignore strikes against their awards and yet
carry on their functions —in other words,
to register without dissent, or without ad-
mitting dissent from employers (Govern-
ment or private), any union demands made.
The very listing of the conditions
which the unions have been drawing up
for perpetuation of their “golden age”
emphasises the rout of the Chifley Ad-
ministration as a government and the im-
possibility of its recovering authority
without the most drastic measures.
The rot set in two years ago when Mr.
Chifley, against his better judgment,
yielded to union clamor and unpegged
wages while still pegging prices. One
false step led to another. He had started
the process of making it ultimately im-
possible for private enterprise to carry on
profitably. Inflation- could be used as
the thin end of the wedge of socialisation.
As though to hasten developments the
Chifley Government, making itself a party
to the 40-hour week hearing in the Arbi-
tration Court, told the Court, through
counsel, what its judgment must be. Then
came the Bank Grab Act to reinforce
excessive taxation in the policy of forcing
private enterprise out of business. For
most of this Parliament’s life Mr. Chifley
has been denouncing all profit-seeking
except by trade-unions and “Labor” in-
vestors in (for instance) wireless stations.
No wonder the unions regard him with
amazement when he condemns strikes,
go-slow and absenteeism! Are they not
inspired by the same objective as Mr.
Chifley? If laying idle an essential in-
dustry is brigandage, what is the Federal
Treasurer’s own selective raid by taxation
on private companies? If Mr. Chifley
doesn’t mind whom else he hits as long as
he gets in a blow at some victim he has
particularly marked down, why should
he reproach the unions with irresponsible
stoppages?
Mr. Chifley is dismayed that the genie
of industrial indiscipline won’t go back
into the bottle. But who let it out? An-
other released genie is the 40-hour week,
and the havoc it is wreaking upon the
wage structure is now undisguised. In
the 14 months since the judgment on the
40-hour week (by Mr.
and inauguration of the socialisation
policy (Mr. Chifley’s creed) gave the cue
to every darg-artist who could get
elected to union control, the basic wage
in the six capital cities has risen from
£5 7s. to £5 IBs. a week, or 10 per cent.,
and in Sydney and Melbourne by more
than that. Its inflationary progress is
now rapidly accelerating.
Melbourne “Age” reported last week
from London that Dr. Evatt, in discussing
with British Ministers on the question of
the Chifley Government’s adherence to
the Marshall Aid programme, sought
assurances that Britain’s commitments to
supply Europe with capital goods would
not divert them from Australia. But
with the need both in Britain and Western
Europe for productive plant to do an
intensive programme of work, why should
such plant be deflected to operate in Mr.
Chifley’s work-shy country, where it
would be put to work only quarter-time
for five days a week?
Failure of production is, writes Pro-
fessor Copland in his review of the Aus-
tralian economic scene of 1948, “the
most disturbing feature” of our condition.
Although there is “full employment,”
with hundreds of thousands more people
nominally at work than in 1939, and
prices for our staple exports are so high
as to frighted everybody, yet, says Cop-
land : —-
Primary output is not much above pre-
war figures;
No substantial increase has taken place
in secondary production;
Output oi, basic materials is only slightly
above pre-war figures and is much less than
is required to maintain present numbers in
employment.
Mr. Dedman, who went with his leader
to the recent conference, told the unions
that, even if coal production this year
reached 12 million tons, it would be 1|
million tons short of requirements, and
that next year industry would demand
14 million tons. And, saying that, he
had not the ghost of a notion as to how
he is going to get anything like the re-
quired amount.
These signs all point to a big change
coming. Mr. Chifley has raised a storm
that he won’t be able to ride. He has
a plan for trying to ride it, and to a
question on the point from a union dele-
gate at the conference he answered
in a way which ought to have sent the
Trades Hall boys home thinking deeply.
In the day of wrath, or “when produc-
tion reaches the stage when there are
surpluses” (the point of the specific
question asked), the Government will still
take care of “full employment,” said Mr.
Chifley, but —
No guarantee can be given to anybody
that they will stay in a particular industry.
There will have to be transfers of workers,
and in many cases transfers of whole com-
munities, to other forms of work 1
am not going to fool anybody in that re-
gard. It may even involve a plan of movable
towns
That is industrial conscription. Mr.
Chifley does not call it by that name, but
his omission should not, as he says him-
self, “fool anybody.” Whatever a man’s
trade, he will go where he is sent and
do whatever work is provided for him.
And in the Socialist-made depression
there won’t be enough taxation revenue
from ruined industry to provide for easy-
going conditions, go-slow, absenteeism
and a 40-hour week. Nor will it matter
much what the wage is, for paper money
won’t be worth much when the supply of
goods runs dry.
Let Australia —all Australia —have a
good look at this prospect and then con-
sider whether keeping Mr. Chifley in
office is worth it.
"Security" for All.
In a radio debate Brisbane’s Town Clerk
deplored “a tendency for citizens to rely
too much on Governments and local
authorities.” He was right. The tendency
does exist, and it is developing apace.
But it is not a tendency that is native to
Australians ; rather is it something that
has been a dope injected into the com-
munity over the past few years —some-
thing that has been fostered and en-
couraged by “Labor” Governments.
“Labor” men from the Prime Minister
down seem to have an obsession for the
word “security,” and to speak and act as
though security were in itself the be-all
and end-all of existence, though their
own economic policy generally is far
from sound.
Dame Enid Lyons spoke up against
this “security” concept when she said that
although every community had a respon-
sibility to ensure a degree of security for
all its members, she warned the Govern-
ment against making that its final objec-
tive :
Those who seek only security generally
perish’ of their own inertia and inactivity
....Australia was not developed by those
who sought only security, but rather by
those possessed of a spirit of adventure
who went out to win new places and make
new homes. In people who are not already
partially dead there remains an urge to
express themselves in a field of wider en-
deavor. I believe that the Government, by
its reiteration of the word “security,” is in
some danger of stifling such incentive.
Blain, M.H.R., said much the same
thing in fewer words and more
picturesque language:
Social services have now developed into
a “ ‘gimme’ club.” The spirit of adven-
ture that built Australia is being killed.
This security twaddle does not ring true.
The two members both hit on the point
that “Labor’s” excessive paternalism is
killing initiative; what they did not em-
phasise is that it is in large degree in-
tended so to do. The Socialists want
people to rely on the Government, to
lean upon it; they want people to feel they
are dependent on the Government. Self-
reliant people are too hard to push about.
If “security” is all the people of this
country want, the Socialists can give it
to them —security of a sort, and for a
time. Security is probably the lot of any
well-conducted herd of dairy cattle.
“Security,” too, is the portion of “lifers”
in a jail, but there is probably not one
of them who would not willingly barter
most of it for a measure of freedom.
Socialism offers the people a security
compounded of elements of both the
herd and the prison. Once a community
comes to look upon its Government* as
the fount of all wealth and the lord and
giver of all necessaries and amenities,
freedom in that community is doomed.
And the community is doomed, too.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Moral Exhaustion.
The Socialist cynics and revolutionaries
at Canberra, with their masters the trade-
union secretaries, will have much to
answer for when the next major
crisis, whether it be economic or
military, has to be faced by Aus-
tralia. We shall have to meet it
with shrunken reserves of effective man-
power, materials and morale —all prin-
cipally the result of “Labor’s” extrava-
gant vote-buying in terms of paper-
money “redistributions” and working-
hours concessions, its attempted socialist
revolution, its assault on private enter-
prise, thrift and initiative, and its con-
nivance, at times blatant, at times sneak-
ing, with the Communist party.
Since 1941 the people have been sold,
by “Labor,” a policy of industrial and
political degeneracy. Heavy taxation,
“controls” and inflation have struck at
initiative and thrift; the 40-hour week
and Communist treachery, added to a
too-ready tendency to loaf and blackmail
by some unionists themselves, have de-
moralised the general industrial attitude ;
and a “social-security” scheme that is
costly and ill-balanced has become more
of an impediment to national security
than otherwise. Standards of public life
have sunk to the lowest level yet, with a
corresponding influence on conduct of
the community.
The Canberra Socialists have had
nearly seven years of coercive and re-
strictive powers over the people, indi-
vidually and as a body, never before
possessed by any Australian Government.
Concurrently, no previous Australian
Government has been constituted of such
a collection of low-standard political
adventurers and petty tyrants. The
achievements of Australian hard work,
enterprise and thrift in the past have
been regarded as political spoils, and the
creators of the national wealth treated
with contempt.
The self-assurance, desire to meddle in
the people’s affairs and arrogant ambition
of the Chifley Ministry know almost no
bounds. Often Mr. Chifley’s appeals to
trade-unionists for greater production are
contradicted by the governmental policy
of his Ministry. So great has been
the social and economic influence
of a crowd which has done so
much to corrupt democratic, respon-
sible government that the “Labor”
reign of seven years in Canberra has
been in the nature of a national disaster,
and must be recognised as such. Chifley-
ism has brought intensified political ex-
ploitation, not increased production of
essential goods and services. We must
acknowledge the fact that widespread
social and industrial demoralisation has
taken place, and invoke that Australian
spirit of fair-play, that desire for real
economic progress, and that principle of
a fair day’s wprk for fair pay without
which this race, so long renowned for its
courage and initiative, will not long sur-
vive as a civilised community.
Black Christmas Coming.
When he addressed the miners on the
northern field a few weeks ago Mr.
Chifley alluded obliquely to Communist
industrial leaders as “fools and traitors.”
What lesser term would he apply to
Government leaders who, in dealings with
Communist miners’ bosses, have repeat-
edly surrendered on points of legal
authority, submitted to political black-
mail in order to persuade the miners to
do a fair day’s work for their liberal pay,
and met with new concessions every
threat of a strike?
It is plain now that the Government
and the country are not going to get
enough coal to tide industry over the
miners’ projected three-weeks holidays
at Christmas. All the crawling to the
larrikin miners through the year, the re-
peated intervention to prevent the Coal
Tribunal from bringing about a show-
down with the miners’ executive, have
gained exactly nothing.
Last April the Coal Board, at its wits’
end with the grave reduction in coal out-
put under strikes, absenteeism, and petty
indiscipline, resolved to apply to the Coal
Tribunal for the outlawing of pit-top
meetings in working hours, *and for more
stringent qualification for miners’ holi-
days. It was decided to require the miners
to work five days, and not merely one
day, before each statutory holiday in
order to qualify for pay for the holiday
taken. Approach of winter, with “virtu-
ally non-existent coal stocks,” was then
the bugbear.
The miners threatened to fight against
the board if it made any such move,
“Fixer” Ashley intervened for the Chifley
Government to stay the board’s hand,
and an agreement voluntarily to mend
their ways was accepted from the miners’
executive.
The agreement was not kept—such
agreements never have been. Again in
August, when the Coal Board could see
that its objective of 13,000,000 tons for
the year would never be achieved, and the
annual problem of how to tide over the
Christmas holidays recurring, another
move was made by authority. The Coal
Board revived its April application, and
the Coal Tribunal ruled that there was
a case for the Miners’ Federation to
answer in the claim that the miners’
award should be varied to provide that:
Miners should work for five days be-
fore and after each statutory holiday to
qualify for payment for that holiday.
Payment for annual leave should be
based on one day’s pay for 15 consecutive
shifts worked during one year, instead of
for each 15 days worked (whether con-
secutive or not) as at present.
Again the Chifiey Government inter-
vened to stop action by the Coal Tribunal,
and the miners’ executive went on record
as undertaking to produce the required
coal by:
Giving, effect within three weeks to the
undertakings in May to assert internal dis-
cipline against stoppages.
Recommending to those concerned the
forking of a second shift in opencut
workings.
Thereafter they also agreed to advocate
the acceptance, which would be by ballot,
of a “back-Saturday” shift at double
pay in order to provide enough coal to
provide for the Christmas holidays.
The * miners’ bosses have cynically
igpored the whole undertaking. There
has been no attempt to get a second shift
working in opencut diggings, there has
been no assertion of “internal discipline,”
there has been no full working on all
fields on alternate Saturdays. The
threat to lay all fields idle over the
trumped-up objection of the miners’
executive to 60 A.W.U. men working on
a rock-tunnel on the South Coast is a
revelation of the calculated insurgence
animating the whole Federal executive,
and not merely irresponsible youngsters.
The indictment against Mr, Chifiey is
that he has destroyed the authority of the
Government, and of the Coal Tribunal,
in the coalmining industry. If he denies
this, let him produce any authority he
has left and assert it.
Women Showed the Way*
For a week Melbourne has been with-
out bread because, although a wages-
board fixed the starting time for baking
at 4 a.m. on ordinary days and midnight
on treble-quantity days, the Operative
Bakers’ Union objected.
The union struck for starting times at
5.30 and 4 a.m. respectively. That was
just its own idea of running the business,
regardless of anybody else—including
the entire community of a great city
left breadless.
The Victorian State Government had
no excuse for marking-time, especially as
another union, the bread-carters’, joined
the Bread Manufacturers’ Association
in demanding observance of the award.
The bread-carters said 5.30 meant too
late a start for them, and held a mass
meeting to protest against prolonging the
strike.
For the whole of last week bread was
wiped off most Melbourne households’
daily fare. A few small bakeries kept
going, but closed when after a day or two
they couldn’t cope with the rush. Some
people got bread flown by aeroplane
from friends in Sydney or Tasmania at
fantastic prices. The Sydney operative
bakers supported the Melbourne union’s
defiance of an arbitration award and de-
clared they would picket trains and aero-
dromes if Sydney suppliers attempted to
relieve the Melbourne famine.
At the end of the week the Victorian
Minister for Labor got the parties at a
conference to agree to resume bread-
making on Monday at 4 a.m., as the
award prescribed. On the same day the
operative bakers and the bread-manufac-
turers held meetings to approve settle-
ment proposals, including “some other
points which the union had been seeking.”
A highlight in the dispute was the de-
mand of the United Women’s Movement
that the Government should comman-
deer flour and yeast stocks, open emerg-
ency bakeries at technical schools and
cookery-centre kitchens and call for
women volunteers to supply bread for
distribution through suburban Town
Halls. The Minister replied—and rather
weakly—that he meant to use “concilia-
tion and not the big stick,” though the'
Melbourne women undoubtedly offered
him a stick to show at his end-of-the-week
conference. It seemed to work—at any
rate the union came to heel after the
Acting - Premier announced in the
Assembly on Thursday that if the strike
was not settled next day the Govern-
ment would intervene with action.
Melbourne would have been a lot more
impressed and would probably have had

before.
Old Pals Rill Out?
The pages of history and literature are
illumined by instances of abiding friend-
ships between men, “passing the love of
women.” On such a level, it seemed, was
the friendship of Federal Ministers Ward
and Calwell. To political friends and
foes alike it appeared that nothing could
impair the high regard in which they held
each other. If Eddie attacked the trading
banks in the afternoon, Arthur would
back him up in the evening; if Arthur
said the capitalist system made him vomit,
Eddie would rush to his support, ready
to vomit, too. On the subject of the
Depression—that calamity which each
asserted was deliberately engineered by
the banks and the anti-“ Labor” Govern-
ments —their voices and their minds
blended so perfectly that to hear one was
to hear the other.
If either Minister was attacked in the
House—a not-uncommon occurrence—the
other could be relied on to spring to his
defence with a stream of vituperation
they seemed to draw from a common
pool. So perfect seemed the under-
standing between the two that they were

sometimes referred to as David and
Jonathan —at other times, as Laurel and
Hardy.
At the last elections the affections of
the two were pretty to watch. Down
to Melbourne went Eddie fo speak in
Arthur’s electorate; up to Sydney came
Arthur to return the compliment. And
return it he did, with interest, if such a
word can be used in respect of two gentle-
men who don’t believe in it. Telling an
East Sydney audience what a fine member
they had in Eddie and how proud he was
to be associated with him, Mr. Calwell
permitted himself to glimpse' a vision of
the future, and said he hoped the day
would come when “you will hear Mr.
Ward deliver a policy speech on behalf
of the Federal Labor party.” Eddie
modestly acknowledged the compliment
with the grin that passes for a blush in
East Sydney.
That was two years ago, and it may be
taken as the high-water mark of the
beautiful friendship. Last Wednesday the
tide, reputedly ebbing for a long time,
went out with a rush. Cabinet Ministers,
even Federal “Labor” ones, cannot spend
all their time vilifying bankers, financiers
and political opponents. Eddie, among
other things, has been busy with plans for
unifying railway gauges, and has been
playing Big Brother to the New Guinea
natives; Arthur’s hobby has been mass-
migration schemes. Railway plans and
New Guinea uplift don’t seem to have
upset Arthur much,- but his migration
programme does not appeal to Eddie at
all, at all. The “progressive” from East
Sydney sticks to “Labor’s” traditional
prejudice—which Arthur, let it be said,
has done much to overcome —that every
newcomer to this country takes bread
out of the mouths of Australians.
So it was that last week Eddie told the
Representatives that it was a mistake to
bring people here until there was proper
accommodation for them; that the first
consideration should be to house people
already here. Arthur, sitting beside him
on the Ministerial benches, said nothing.
Possibly he was calculating that on such a
basis the next migrant would arrive here
about the same day as Eddie became
leader of the Federal “Labor” party. Or
maybe he was pondering over reports that
under a redistribution plan approved by
Caucus Eddie will need all the support he
can get if he is to hold East Sydney at
the next election.
POLITICAL POINTS
The American Presidential elections
will be held on Melbourne Cup Day. If
horses were as easy to pick as Presi-
dents this season there wouldn’t be a
bookie left in the game after next Tues-
day.;
Last week the Political Committee of
U.N.O. General Assembly turned down
the Soviet proposals for international con-
trol of atomic energy and the destruction
of existing supplies of atom-bombs.
There was no other sane course possible
despite the comment of Britain’s unwar-
like War Minister, Shinwell, that the pro-
posal should be examined “for its sin-
cerity.” As Churchill said at Llandudno
the previous week: “If the United States
were to consent, in reliance upon
any paper agreement, to destroy
the stocks of atomic bombs which
they have accumulated, they would
be guilty of murdering human free-
dom and committing suicide them-
selves.” Russia’s vile record of broken
promises and cynical disregard for human
rights and liberties have brought her to
the point where no offer she makes can
be taken at its face-value. All nations
outside the Iron Curtain seem agreed on
that; of the 58 countries on the com-
mittee, only Russia and her five satellites
voted for the motion.
Federal Cabinet is by now probably
accustomed to occasional outbursts by
Eddie Ward along lines opposed to agreed
policy, but its collective nervous system
must have sustained a severe shock when
Scully, vice-president of the Executive
Council, stigmatised as “stupid” its deci-
sion to import bauxite from Malaya for
the Tasmanian aluminium project. Scully
pointed out that in N. S. Wales alone
there were something like 20,000,000 tons
of bauxite. The ex-Minister for Com-
merce may have been moved by the fact
that most of the deposits are in his own
electorate; more likely his action was
merely a revolt against the monotony of
his job as Minister for the Gag.
On Monday the position in the French
coal-strike looked ugly. Cabinet had
authorised troops and police to use fire-
arms if attacked, and in clashes with
armed strikers casualties had occurred.
The Moscow-directed strike, already in
its fourth week, had cost France three
million tons of coal and was assuming
the status of an insurrection. The moral
for Australia is too obvious to need stres-
sing.
The 40-hour week, introduced to N. S.
Wales ahead of the Federal Arbitration
Court by that prize fathead McGirr, has
brought more leisure for gambling, booze
and crime. Murder after murder,
brutality after brutality, has been the
State’s shocking record over the past few
months. One unfortunate who was
kicked to death in Sydney last week is
reputed to have won a “major” prize
in “th’ lott’ry” two years ago ; though in
a job, he “started a round of city hotels
at 11 a.m. on Friday and drank steadily
throughout the day.” He ended the jag
“the victim of two inhuman thugs, who
bashed and kicked him with such ferocity
that his face was smashed to pulp, his
skull fractured and his body covered with
wounds” (“Truth” report). Instead of
urging his Cabinet to enforce the death
penalty for murder, Premier McGirr,
faced with problems like this, is more
likely to react like a decapitated fowl.
It is difficult to discard the cherished
beliefs of a lifetime, and most “Labor”
men have been brought up in the creed
that every strike is a good strike and
that any strike is better than no strike at
all. Lately there have been waverings ;
Chifley said recently that he “was not
always able to see the reason that may
drive men to strike,” and last week
Chalmers, N.S.W. M.L.A. for Hartley,
after the customary safeguard—“l would
be the last to suggest that the great trade-
unions should give away their right to
strike” —went on to say that the produc-
tion-lag was caused by chronic absentee-
ism and pettifogging stoppages for many
of which he could see no reason. But
words are one thing, actions another; and
the only thing the “Governments” at
Canberra and Sydney could do in regard
to the pettifogging stoppage that was
causing a “production-lag” of 10,000
tons a day on the South Coast coalfields
was t® order the Australian Iron and
Steel Co. to cease work on a tunnel de-
signed to speed-up production.
The “Manila girls” debate was put on
another, but not necessarily a higher,
plane when “Labor” Senator O’Flaherty,
saying that “a great deal of fuss had been
made about these girls,” told the grafe,
reverend seigniors of the Upper House
that the agreement must be observed so
that the girls “would not be stranded and
so that they could be kept out of
brothels.” This was a new approach
altogether. Calwell’s talk has been
of a “gentleman’s agreement” which
must be honored as a matter of
principle; O’Flaherty’s moral concern
can only be taken as implying that he
considers Uncle Sam has gone into busi-
ness as a procurer.
O’Flaherty’s capacity for putting his
foot in it isn’t newly-revealed. Before
the 1946 elections, when popular clamor
was for tax reductions and the papers
were full of Government advertisements
exhorting people to save, the old boy
came out with a suggestion that members’
salaries should be kicked up to £l5OO a
year. Sitting pretty himself, with three
years of his term to run, colleagues who
had to face the electors felt a trifle em-
barrassed. Of course, after the elections
it was a different matter.
Humility in high places:
Nature has made the honorable member
for Balaclava handsome, but it did not
give him any brains. It gave the honor-
able member for the Northern Territory a
sense of humor. It has not given me a
good voice, or made me handsome, but
it has treated me much more generously in
the supply of brains than it has treated
most members opposite.
Calwell speaking, and presumably using
the whole supply.
Victoria’s Acting-Premier McDonald,
commenting on suggestions by British
town-planning authority Sir Patrick Aber-
crombie for the future planning of Mel-
bourne, told reporters that the thing to
aim at was not a Greater Melbourne, but
a Greater Victoria, “Melbourne now
contains more than half, of Victoria’s
population,” he said, “and if it continues
to expand as rapidly it will be to the
detriment of State development.” The
same thing can be said of all our capital
cities. Bleeding the inland of its natural
increase, they have become swollen to
an extent that is a danger to the country.
Between the two census years 1933 and
1947 the population of the area within
100 miles of Sydney increased by 370,000,
while that of the district north of the
Hunter River grew by only 45,000 despite
the fact that its excess of births over
deaths during the period was 117,000.
“The Commonwealth Office of Educa-
tion” has put out a poster abusing the
United States system of government.
Though Dedman, embarrassed, denied
that Communists had any hand in it, its
message that the “big-business” political
boss controls governmental agencies in
America seems to harmonise well with
the present Com. slogan: “Wall-street
Wants War.”
Eire’s attitude towards the last tenuous
link with Britain seems to be “Shure, we
don’t want iny part of yez, but if ye’ll
only let us cut the tie, bejabers we’ll be
closer to yez than iver.”
Dentists in South Australia have an-
nounced that they are “nob keen on Can-
berra control of any sort and certainly
not in regard to dental social services.”
It was their president who passed the
comment, but he did not mention whether
he was authorised to speak for Cyril
Chambers, who did quite a lot of tooth-
pulling in Adelaide before he joined the
Canberra team.
The Federal Government may want an
amendment of the very liberal laws of
domicile in this country in order to enable
it to deport “undesirable aliens,” just as
the Returned Servicemen’s League wants
to amend its rules so as to expel Com-
munists. But when it seeks to legislate
that a Supreme Court Judge shall be
appointed as a Commissioner to investi-
gate “the conduct and character” of an
undesirable without following legal forms
or being bound by any rules of evidence,
it is both overstepping the mark in a
democracy and asking impossibilities of
a Supreme Court judge. That is not how
Judges are brought up, and the Com-
munist trial system is as abhorrent to any
British community as is Communist
treason.
For the year to June 30, 1948, the
Sydney Harbor bridge showed a surplus
of £85,297 (up £35,196) of revenue
(£519,129) over expenditure—outgo in-
cluded cost of collecting tolls, mainten-
ance of the structure, interest on the debt
and exchange charges, and sinking-fund
appropriation. Quite a profitable public
utility ; but the time seems not far distant
when it will be better to let Consolidated
Revenue bear all charges ip connection
with the bridge and to pull down the toll-
gates. Petrol-rationing notwithstanding,
traffic congestion on the bridge during
peak hours is becoming a civic problem.
The power* of a bad example. It has
become a commonplace when one union
is on strike for others to support it irre-
spective of the rights or wrongs of the
case; it is fairly common, too, for small
shopkeepers in the vicinity of a dispute
to be intimidated into supporting the
strikers. The vicious practice now seems
to be spreading beyond the unions. Three
Melbourne bakers who stood out against
the bread strike last week found their
supplies of yeast cut off, and the secretary
of the Bread Manufacturers’ Association
admitted that his organisation had asked
the yeast manufacturers not to supply
yeast to suburban bakers until the strike
ended. The strike arose out of a dis-
pute between the master-bakers and their
employees. As is usual in all these argu-
ments, the public are the main sufferers.
Westralia is to have a steel-fabricating
works which it is hoped will in time grow
into a full-scale steelworks. Companies
have been formed under agreements with
the W.A. Government to wed Collie coal
with Yampi Sound iron-ore, the Govern-
ment to make available suitable land
within 10 miles of Perth. Nominal
capital .of the companies approximates
£5,000,000.
A Public Service Board report tabled
in the Victorian Assembly complains of
a “grave loss of staff” by the State public
service. The loss is felt most severely
in the case of scientific and technical
officers who have been lured away by
better-paid jobs. Main offenders, it
appears, are Commonwealth depart-
ments, which with unlimited hoards of
taxpayers’ money behind them can dangle
enticing offers in front of the State blokes.
The Falstein appeal case, in which the
Federal member for Watson is asking the
N. S. Wales Full Court for a rule nisi
restraining Isles, S.M., from proceeding
further with his conviction and fine of
£320 on Customs breaches, nearly went on
the rocks last Thursday when it was re-
vealed that Falstein had also lodged an
appeal to Quarter Sessions. Chief Jus-
tice Jordan said in that case it was
a waste of time for the Full Court to go
on with the hearing, whereupon Falstein’s
counsel said the Quarter Sessions appeal
wduld be abandoned. There seemed to
be some doubt whether this could be
done, and counsel for the Crown re-
marked that his opponent was in the posi-
tion of a man with a double-headed
penny. Finally it was decided to go on
with the Full Court hearing, but to with-
hold decision.
All the worst features of “militancy”
are present in the Kemeira dispute. Three
weeks ago a spokesman for the A.W.U.
men employed on the tunnel complained
of “Communist domination” on the South
Coast, saying that those who did not
choose to accept “Federation law” were
in danger of being starved out of the dis-
trict, and that in some casesi Communists
resorted to bashings. Comrade Williams
indignantly denied, the bashings ; he said
nothing about the starvation charge. Last
week it was reported that all roads to the
tunnel were picketed and that local
traders had been warned not to supply
goods to the men working there. The
tunnel cook claimed that he had been
warned by a Communist that unless he
left the job he and his family “would be
blackballed out of the district.” He
went back to the tunnel through pad-
docks —“no taxi would take me, and God
knows what might happen to a man if he
attempted to walk to the tunnel along the
picketed roads.” Thus is Canberra’s
“full-employment” and “higher-produc-
tion” policy implemented.
Once upon a time the drought-stricken
farmer or the weary swagman would dis-
gustedly aver that “they ought t’ give
the country back to the blacks.” Binghi
mightn’t take it today.

PERSONAL ITEM
Captain G. Cove has relieved Sir James
Bissett as captain of the Queen Mary.
It’s not the first time he’s sailed a queen.
Old Aquitania, his former command, was
generally accepted among those qualified
to judge, particularly when in a convoy
with her modern sisters, as being still the
most graceful liner afloat. Raked overall,
from her long hull to sloping masts,
funnels and underslung counter-stern,
she had the grace and dignity of a queen
among flappers. Captain Cove is a genial
cove, with a store of anecdotes and a salty
air of telling ’em that makes him the best
raconteur the Red Duster has produced
since Noah lectured on the voyage of the
Ark.
Shantan, a small walled town in China
at the foot of a rearing mountain range
in north Tibet, was in the days of the
T’ang emperors the forward capital of
China, boasting a million inhabitants.
Today it holds only 30,000 desperately
poor people. Yet the name of the town
is once again known throughout China.
The man who put it back on the map is
a Maorilander, Rewi Alley. He has
established there a school of “industrial
co-operatives,” the aim of which is to
train young Chinese industrially so that
they can introduce industrial methods
into the countless villages of an over-
whelmingly agricultural country. During
the war Alley had 5000 co-operatives
operating in 82 centres, making most of
the blankets and clothing used by the
Chinese Army. Now his boys are being
trained to make pottery, glass, stationery,
rugs and leatherwork. After eight years
in Shantan they will be sent as instructors
into the villages. In China since 1925,
Alley has no false notions about the
essential gradualness of his immense ex-
periment—which is, in effect, to help the
Chinese pull themselves up by their own
efforts.
British midshipmen are a self-reliant
young breed. Richard Clough, the 18-
year-old snotty who died in Portland
Harbor trying to make his ship with a
loaded five-ton pinnace which in civil life
would be cox’ned by a man twice his age,
was typical of a rank whose members are
treated and expected to act as men
almost from the time they don uniform.
A midshipman will cox’n the King’s
barge from Vanguard to shore on the
coming cruise; and than that, the
cynosure of all eyes (including the com-
mander’s), greater responsibility has no
man.
“Trinco”; Calwell and Emperor Haile Selas-
sie are in the same boat —one wants his Manila
girls back, the other his chef; and none of the
escapees likes the idea. In 1933 Erwin Faller,
born a Swiss, now a naturalised American, won
the post of Emperor’s cook, from 500 appli-
cants —partly because Haile Selassie wanted a
neutral with no interest in spiking his victuals.
When he started, Faller was just a royal chef;
when Mussolini chased him and his master out
of Ethiopia in 1936 his job carried a six-months
holiday a year with pay, lavish tips, two cars,
a summer home and tiger-hunts and entertain-
ment thrown in. One of his culinary triumphs
was to plan three meals a day for 14 days
without duplicating a dish during the visit of
Sweden’s Crown Prince in November, 1935.
At one meal 1200 guests sat down. This effort
won the chef a royal slap on the back and art
equally royal 800-dollar tip. In time he bossed
the palace, supervising its 50 rooms and 50
bathrooms, buying all the royal provender and
parking visiting camel caravans in the court-
yard. Once a dignified banquet was thrown
into uproar when three royal lions escaped and
tried to join it. The royal keeper, in jail for
murder, was released to restrain his charges.
But escape to America via Buenos Aires in
1937 changed all that for the Emperor’s erst-
while chef. Now cook of a Washington Hotel,
he wrote in reply to a recent plea to return that
the taste of freedom, plus some influence from
his mother-in-law, compelled him regretfully to
decline. The Manila girls are probably in-
fluenced by a taste of the same heady dish.
At Palmerston North (M.L.) recently,
the association of the considerable Danish
community living there presented King
Frederick IX’s Order of Knight of Dan-
nebrog to a man who, landing in Maori-
land from Denmark as a lad 70 years
ago with practically no English, is noW
a world-noted authority on Polynesian
ethnology and Maori folk-lore. He is
Johannes Andersen, for years librarian
of Wellington’s Turnbull Library. What
he doesn’t know about native bird-life
simply isn’t knowledge.
Passed on in Sydney, at 76, Wally
Weekes was Australia’s ablest boxing in-
structor since Larry Foley. In his gym.-
c«m-barbershop at Paddington (N.S.W.),
Weekes taught such topnotchers as Dave
Smith, Australasian amateur heavyweight
champion, and Jack Read, Australian
lightweight champion in 1913, Turning
a Boniface, Weekes conducted some of
Sydney’s best pubs, among them Gar-
ratt’s, the Balfour and the Plaza. He
also took a hand at suburb-building.
When the only inhabitant of what is now
North Bondi was the city hangman,
Weekes built his sporting camp there, and
later his home on the same site. Always
in good condition, he was still playing
football at an age when most-men are
considering giving up bowls.
“Fitz”: Author of Three Centuries of Ballet,
a handsomely designed and expertly written
book just published by the Australasian Pub-
lishing Co, of Sydney, Cornelius Conyn first got
to know and like Australians while a p.-0.-w.
in Sumatra. A medical orderly in the Dutch
Army, he was working as a journalist in
Sumatra when he enlisted —he was taken
prisoner when the Japs invaded the N.E.1.,
and was in Medan, Achee and Pakan Baru
prison camps. The Dutch loaned him
to the Australian forces in captivity and
he stayed with them until the end of the
war in the Pacific. He made so many
cobbers among the Aussies that he
decided to come to Australia upon his
liberation, and is now a popular figure
in Sydney cultural circles. Since
settling here he has worked for both
press and radio in addition to lectur-
ing on the ballet for the Sydney Uni.
Extension Board. Born in Amster-
dam, the son of a Dutch father and
French mother, Conyn became Paris
correspondent for a Dutch newspaper,
and for 10 years was an art and ballet
critic for papers in his homeland.
While in Paris he had a volume of
verse published and a play produced,
and was the choreographer for “The
Errant Forces,” a ballet to Scriabin’s
music, which made a hit in France
and Belgium; Although Conyn has
a comprehensive knowledge of the
whole field of the ballet he has made
a special study of Spanish folk-danc-
ing, wrote a book on the subject
which was published by Cyril Beau-
mont in London in 1937, and since his
sojourn here has composed small
choreographies for Adele Romano, the
Australian-Spanish dancer. A small
and dapper fellow with a sound grasp
of the English language, including
Australian idioms and slang, he is a
joy to listen to when launched on his
favorite topic.

To most of Australia—and a good
part of the world on The Day—the Mel-
bourne Cup means the surge of packed
thousands on a racecourse dressed for
the event of its life, the flash and color
and sweating strain of a score of pound-
ing thoroughbreds. But to two crafts-
men in Melbourne, Jim Steeth and
his son Maurice, the Cup means what
it is—a beautifully executed piece of
handbeaten gold-work. For four genera-
tions Steeth’s family have been gold-
smiths. Originating in Dublin, their
craftwork has found homes throughout
the world, the Royal family owning some
fine pieces. When Mcßeath poked into
a workroom at Drummond’s, Melbourne,
where the Cup is made, they showed him
the plans, drawn on a faded piece of
writing paper, of their original Cup, won

by Artilleryman in 1919. Recognised as
a masterpiece, the present trophy contains
26|oz. of IBct. gold, and in design varies
little from the first. Its creator was born
in Collingwood (Vic.), and until recently
no hands but his touched the job. Now,
in accordance with family tradition, the
son has been taught the intricacies of
delicately hammering with a tool made
from the hide of a rhinoceros’s foot over
two pounds of gold into a gleaming shrine
nearly 18in. high, worth, intrinsically,
£3OO, When finished, the job is handed
to grandmother Steeth for final criticism.
After that, another member of the firm,
a Young Digger named Bill Findlow, takes
over. He receives the V.R.C.’s commis-
sion to make the Cup, is responsible for
its safe housing, takes it to the course
on the big day and guards it there until
the winning owner, through the G.-G.,
takes it off his hands.
The chief adversary of Canada’s P.M.-
elect, Stephen St. Laurent, at the country’s
next general elections will be Lt.-Col.
George Drew, who this month became
leader of the Progressive-Conservative
Party. A gunner in the first scrap, he
was made a K.C. in 1933, led Ontario’s
Conservatives in 1938 and became the
Province’s Premier five years later. His
Government lost a vote of confidence,
went to the country and was returned
with a definite majority. It was re-elected
this year. Drew has written several
books, one about Canada’s airmen, and
is married to the daughter of the Metro-
politan Opera Co.’s general-manager.

Q.M.-General at Keswick in the last
scrap, he moved to Sydney as a colonel on
the administrative side, and further north

his private practice was given up to join
the Crown Law Department. He relaxes

“Macnell”; Hanging in a corner of a.
small yacht-rigging shop in Erskine-
street, Sydney, spiced with the tang of
Stockholm tar and new hemp, is one of
the most beautifully knotted bell-ropes
ever to grace a clapper. Made by Captain
John Maitland, who owns the shop, it
will be presented to the King for Van-
guard’s quarterdeck bell by the League
of Ancient Mariners. Maitland first
tasted salt as an eight-year-old net-boy in
North Sea sailing trawlers in 1889.
Conventionally, he ran away to sea, and
had his eleventh birthday in Valparaiso.
British ships in those days were hungry
and tough, and it was common for sea-
men to change their nationalities almost
as often as their oilskins. In turn a
naturalised Finn, Norwegian and Ameri-
can, the captain recalls that his first suit
of oilskins, when he was on two-bob a
month, were made of potato sacks water-
proofed with paint. Coming ashore in
1938, after a faithful 50 years in sail, he
was co-opted by the Yanks to train their
water-transport men in New Guinea.
Now, apart from keeping the rigging of
Sydney’s ocean-going yachts in trim, his
prime object in life is to perpetuate the
old sailorman’s fast-dying craft in rope-
work. This he is doing through his two
sons.
Into the silence:
In Sydney, William Jackson, F.R.G.S. and
press photographer. One of the best in the
game, he went with an expedition to the Ant-
arctic, toured South Sea islands for Pathe, and
made a photographic survey of parts of New
Guinea.

In Melbourne, Leo Cussen, one of the
country’s outstanding jurists. Admitted to the
Bar in 1907, his most noted defence was that
of Dr. Peacock, committed for murder in 1911.
The jury’s finding was guilty, but the Full High
Court ordered a new trial, in which Cussen’s
brilliance reversed the verdict. After the first
war there was a dive for him whenever trig
cases were involved, and before a serious car
accident impaired his powers of concentration

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Becks”: When I read that a Brisbane
Parliamentarian had revealed to the
Queensland Assembly that Mr. Fadden
had once told “a dirty, filthy story” at
a Gatton College function my natural
taste for the salacious made me read on
in the hope that he would quote the yarn.
My expectations were raised when the
stern accuser went on to say that “he
had yet to meet a working-man with as
filthy a tongue as Mr. Fadden.” I’ve met
some working-men—and non-workers,
too —whose tongues could with profit take
a deal of scraping, so the Fadden anec-
dote which evoked the protest promised
to be a real hair-raiser. Presently I came
to it, Artie said: “I like speeches to
be like women’s dresses—long enough to
cover the subject, but short enough to be
interesting.” Well, if that’s enough to
make an honest working-man blush I’m
going to lodge a complaint under the
Obscenities Act next time I hear a
Sunday-school superintendent tell a
newly-married couple he hopes all their
troubles will be little ones.

“Bo” on the proper nurture of infants:
I rejoice to observe that at long last there
has arisen one—and a Cambridge educational
psychologist at that—to debunk some of the
ultra-modern ways of bringing up babies. The
hero casts himself boldly into the lists by cham-
pioning the cause of the dummy—that bete
noire of the baby clinic. In my own infancy, I
remember, I had but to open my face and
almost before I could emit a roar the gap
would be filled by a “comforter.” Usually
father forked it out of the pocket he kept his
pipe in—that is how I got my first taste for
tobacco. Far from thus being unhygienic, as
the modern-method cranks would claim, that
old tobacco-stained dummy unquestionably kept
the germs at bay—and why shouldn’t it?
After all, don’t we blow tobacco-dust over
plants to kill wogs, and what old bushman will
not boast that tobacco-juice is the perfect anti-
dote to a bite by anything from a red-bellied
black to a 20ft. crocodile? Asking crushingly
why that model of commonsense the cradle was
abolished, for even the most modern mother
has to resort to rocking—in her arms —to get
baby to sleep at times, the psychologist strikes
his strongest blow in the matter of infant-
feeding. Horrifying the set-period purists, he
asserts: “The natural way to feed a child is
when it is hungry.” And I heartily agree. I
remember putting up for 24 hours with the
hullabaloo consequent on the wife’s endeavors,
on her return from hospital, conscientiously to
abide by the clinic’s instructions as to the feed-
ing of our firstborn. On the second night I
sleepily plucked the infant from his bassinet
and dropped him on to the maternal bowser.
There and thereafter he would imbibe happily
all night, dropping off only when he got to the
beatific state that had a pea been dropped on
his stomach it would have bounced a foot. Ex-
cept for chronic indigestion the child, now
grown up, is a model of healthy vigor,

“B. A. Ker”: Fidgeting through the
screening of “Forever Amber” and mar-
velling how Hollywood contrived to make
such a boring film with such material
to work on as the Civil War, the Great
Plague and the Fire of London, I found
myself pondering on the biggest howler
of all: Amber, having murdered a thiev-
ing nurse, wishes to dispose of the body.
From the street comes the sepulchral call:
“Bring out your dead; bring out your
dead.” Amber goes to the door, calls
the corpse-collector, and he comes in
and takes away the body. Actually, it
could not have happened; this would be
nearer the pattern:
Amber: “There is a body in here.”
Corpse-collector: “So what?” Amber:
“Come in and get it.” C.C.: “What, me
carry the body all that way! Not on your
life.” Amber: “But you get paid to do it.”
C.C.: “Ah, no, lady; I get paid to pick up
bodies after they are brought out to the
street. Accordin’ to the rules of the Corpse-
collectors’ Union I don’t step over a door-
step. Why, our slogan tells you that; it
ain’t ‘We carry out your dead,’ it’s ‘Bring
out your dead.’ ” Amber: “But I can’t
carry the body.” C.C.: “Bad luck, lady.”
Amber: “Then what can I do?” C.C.
(cheerily): “Got no idea, lady. G’bye.”
Fade-out, with the C.C. moving down the
street calling: “Bring out your dead; bring
out your dead.” •
But perhaps I’d been brooding too much
on the way the garbage-man carried on
when I asked him to take away a few
scraps of tin,

“Kenwood”: My collection of cigar-

1896 with colored plates are all the great

War heroes —all the people mentioned in
the song describing some unfortunate
baby’s name as Kitchener, Carrington,
Kekewich, Methuen, White, and so on,
but of special interest are a young colonel
in a broad hat, named Baden-Powell;
a Captain Cox with feather-plumed hat,
later to be known as “Fighting Charlie”
and as a N.S.W. Senator; and —the only
one in civvies—a fresh-faced young
fellow named Winston Churchill. Sailors
and soldiers of all nations, in their
glittering uniforms —so spectacular on
parade, and so unsuitable for war; the
everyday words that don’t mean a thing
to the kid of today: dragoons, lancers,
grenadiers, hussars, fusiliers. Yes ; the
collection of cigarette-cards made by the
kid of 50 years ago is most interesting
to the same kid today.

“Gainsborough”: In studying the
“Wanted” columns to find a better job
than the one I have, I have noticed that
the demand is mainly for men between
25 and 30. But the older man is not
altogether left out in the cold. In Adel-
aide “Advertiser” (9/10/’4B) there was an
advt. for an “assistant for prospecting
party in northern part of State” with the
proviso that “applicant should preferably
be over forty years.” Someone with a
grudge against youth? Or has he had
enough experience of “under-forties” who
pine for the bright lights?

“Pooth Arl”: “Laetitia” is not quite
correct about his tuba tipple. It is the
spathe that bears the nuts which is cut so
that the juice which would normally go
into the nuts is collected in the suspended
jar. Fermentation has set in by the time
the juice is collected, and after 24 hours
the alcoholic content is about nine per
cent. It is a pleasant drink rather like
home-brewed ginger-beer with a strong
coconut flavor. After 48 hours the fer-
mentation has gone far enough to con-
vert the alcohol into acetic-acid and the
pleasant drink has become an efficient
emetic. The brew “Laetitia” bumped
into was probably this fresh toddy which
had been kept for a few hours in a jar
previously rubbed with a leaf of the
thorn-apple (Datura stramonia ); the
effect is similar to drinking potato-spirit
new from the still. The amount of
datura must be regulated by an expert.
One man who left the leaves in the toddy
gave our M.O. quite a scare when five
of the guests died within a few hours
showing symptoms of cholera.

“A.L.A.” (Fiji): The old-time custom
in Penang for guests to embarrass the
Chinese bride and groom at their wed-
ding breakfast (B. 18/8/’4B) differs from
that followed in Yunnan, s.-w. China.
There in my time, about 1920, the bride
did not even join the party, but having,
with her husband, greeted the guests, she
sat alone in a room specially prepared
for her; at the end of the feast the
guests entered one by one merely to bow
to her. Custom forbade conversation.
But the relations later assembled to make
uncomplimentary and offensive allegations
which continued until the bride was
goaded sufficiently to retaliate with an
even more outrageous remark, when the
taunting ended.

“Conda”: The disaster in Portland
harbor, England, when a heavily-loaded
pinnace swamped in big seas and 28
libertymen were drowned only a few
yards from their ship. Illustrious, en-
genders a thought of how many sailors
might have been saved if the Navy taught
its men to swim. The only regulation is
that an A.B. must be able to swim a
short distance fully-clad before he can
be rated a leading-seaman. The Service
possesses an excellent team of physical-
training instructors —all ships above
destroyer-size carry at least one —and
their use for training the company of a
seagoing ship seems too obvious for
comment. But how many more of the
crews of Prince of Wales, Repulse, Perth,
Yarra —to name only a few —would be
alive if this obvious but neglected oppor-
tunity had been availed of?

“0.W.W.”: Several weeks earlier than

“People’s Voice,” is imploring the faithful

can take three weeks’ holiday at Christ-
mas and enjoy a few capitalistic com-
forts., Last year’s donation-list contained
a majority of Tito’s countrymen, but
Yugoslav reaction this time is a doubtful

“Pooth Arl”: Tell “Ceg” those crummy

used the term to signify anything strange

a boy from Staffordshire I found that I
had a fight on my hands and a complaint
from his parents to mine. In his part
of the Old Dart the meaning was defi-
nitely “lousy.”

“Hamer”: Faulconbridge, which now
has a Prime Minister-avenue (B.
13/10/’4B), was once very indifferent on
such matters. Thirty-odd years ago I
went to the little mountain town to in-
spect a holiday cottage, and, whilst there,
had a look at the grave of Henry Parkes ;
its neglect shocked me. Next week my
par. about the grave being over-
grown with weeds and otherwise dilapi-
dated appeared in The Bulletin. A
mere half-dozen lines; but the effect
was tremendous. Almost every paper
in Australia had a comment upon the
matter, some running to leading articles ;
the Victorian papers were particularly
caustic. A question was asked in the
N.S.W. Parliament; the Government
answered it by making available a sum of
money for restoration and an annual
grant for maintenance —still continued.
Afterwards someone donated land for
a park in the vicinity of the grave ; the
Prime Minister-avenue was a develop-
ment from that.

“Lim-Limbu”: Things are almost back

and chickens. But when! the fowls began
to despoil the second lady’s garden
handed her dark house-help a rifle. He
wasn’t new to firearms, and in a moment
the chickens were orphans. The first lady
recovered the bullet and laid a complaint;
a chilly atmosphere now hangs over the
two houses. It doesn’t seem to worry the
brown brothers —they shared the roast
chook —but the surviving chicks face a
bleak future.

“Cygnis”: Latest Australian church to
celebrate its centenary is the Albany
(W.A.) parish church of St. John the
Evangelist. On October 25 a bronze
tablet was unveiled in the porch of the
church to commemorate its consecration
in 1848 by Bishop Short, whose diocese
at that time comprised South and West
Australia. Albany’s first place of worship
was an eight-sided lath-and-plaster build-
ing built and conducted by Thomas
Brooker Sherratt. The Octagon stood
from 1835 until 1890, and in it on April
12, 1841, a meeting of citizens resolved
upon the erection of St. John’s, which
was commenced in granite later the same
year. Seven years later when its first
rector, John Ramsden Wollaston, arrived
it was still incomplete, but he seized on

“Well, now the war is over we all revert

“J.H.M.A.” on Sydney Town Hall:
Although Sydney is the oldest settlement in
Australia it cannot claim to be the senior muni-
cipality of the Commonwealth. Adelaide beats
it by "two years. Until 1842 the capital of
N.S.W. was ruled domestically by three magis-
trates, and it is not much over a century since
the Municipal Council started to look for lodg-
ings under the direction of Mayor Hosking
and a committee. The first months of its exist-
ence had been spent in rooms at the Royal
Hotel in George-street —where Dymock’s book-
shop now stands; then it moved into the Pultney
Hotel in York Street. For the next quarter of
a century the council chambers were a sort of
movable camp. They were at the York-street
address until 1854, and during the period when
the city was first controlled by commissioners a
move was made to the top of King-street into
part of the building that was formerly the
Oxford Hotel. In April, 1857, the City Council
was re-established, and its first move was to
approach the Government for a site for a Town
Hall. On September 13 it was granted an area
of land, more than an acre in extent, upon part
of which the Hotel Metropole was afterwards
erected, and designs for a building were drawn
up. However, it was presently considered that
the position was unsuitable, and in 1862 the
Council sold the block. In the meantime the
aldermen had begun again to seek a resting-place
of a permanent sort, and in 1859 they tried un-
successfully to get hold of part of Wynyard-
square, and in February, 1860, it was decided, to
lease from Jacob Marks for five years a building
in what is now Carrington-street. It had been
the first home of the Union Club, and when the
Council left it later, on it became the Town Hall
Hotel, and subsequently the Imperial Hotel; it
has since been demolished. Here the Mayor
and aldermen conducted their business for eight
years when another migration was made across
the square into York-street, between Erskme
and Margaret streets. While carrying on here
the Council for the second time requested the
Government to hand over the old Sydney burial-
ground at the top of Brickfield Hill as a site for
municipal buildings. This time they got what
they wanted, and the necessary Act was passed
on March 3, 1869. Architectural plans were
called for, the design of J. A. Wilson was
accepted, and work began. The foundation-
stone was laid by the Duke of Edinburgh on
August 4, 1868, and the building was finished in
September, 1874—30 years after the Council had
begun 'its wanderings in the Sydney wilderness.
Five years later plans were prepared for the
great hall, and in 1883 the first contract was let.
The huge chamber —known as the Centennial
Hall —was finished in April, 1889, and officially
opened in the following November.
A JUG OF WINE.
“Australian wine production for the past three
years has beaten all records, and, although exports to
Britain are little more than half of the pre-war
figure, mainly because of shipping difficulties, Aus-
tralians are drinking three times as much ot their
own vintages as in 1939.”
It’s an ill wind —the proverb’s often quoted —
Blows no one profit, in some form or shape;
A sort of Providence, it may be noted,
From whose mysterious workings none escape.
So now we’ve those whose efforts are devoted
To marketing the products of the grape
Frankly announcing that they’re on a more
Remunerative pitch than e’er before.
Well, and why not? Who grudges them
augmenting
Their output and their dividends, the clan
Which deals in what was Father Noah’s
inventing
At some dim date ere history began,
To wit, the growth and culture and fermenting
Of that “which fnaketh glad the heart of
man”?
A memorable phrase, you must admit,
Wherewith the Psalmist eulogises it.
Wine ! Think of all the poetry, from Homer
To Virgil and to Horace, writt’n about
The purple joy, the tack that Persian Omar
Found it impossible to do without! •
The nectar of the gods! What a misnomer
Were such a term applied to beer or stout
Or rum or gin! What grog has ever been
Comparable with “blushful Hippocrene”?
Though news that local vintages are booming
Sales triple those attained in years gone by,
Sets wowsers acrimoniously fuming,
’Tis time for them to realise —or try —
The soberest nations are the ones consuming
The wines their own resources can supply.
Traditionally trained to look askance
At fiercer and more potent stimulants.

“Whang”: “To remove buttons,”
writes a woman’s paper, “use* a razor-
blade or knife; the cutting-edge of
scissors will get dulled.” Charles Lamb
used a penknife to free himself from the
detaining grip of the loquacious Coleridge
upon his coat-button. Severing the con-
necting threads he went upon his busi-
ness, to recover, the button some five
hours later when, the poet’s discourse
winding to an end, his fingers had relaxed
their hold. A scribbler. Lamb’s penknife
would, have been sharp enough to do the
deed swiftly and without disturbing the
speaker; doubtless it was resharpened
later. But if any instrument is necessary
for removing buttons, what’s wrong with
the mangle or wringer?

“Spike”: Competition between
observers of the first cuckoo and the
last primrose of the season for space in
the London “Times” looks like falling off
next year; a new subject threatens to
crowd out most other things from now
till Domesday. A little to the left of
its main obituaries column, a recent
“Times” recorded, with protective quotes,
the death of “the bravest cat in the
world.” Faith by name and a church-
mouser by occupation, the cat won a
certificate for steadfast courage in the
battle of Britain:
She shielded her kitten in the corner
of the rectory where she remained through
bombing and fire roofs and masonry ex-
ploded and the whole house blazed....
four floors fell through in front of her,
yet she stayed calm and steadfast. Little
is known of Faith before she entered the
church, but it is believed she was a stray.
I can see them all —shoals of letters pour-
ing in. Small stuff at first concerning
Mayfair cats who protected their mis-
tresses from mice or Pekinese; letters
from retired Indian colonels about Black
Mocongo pythons and how Tibby
“Well, I suppose that ends the honeymoon !”
saved the camp. The thing will spread
until every cat-owner who can handle
pen and ink has had his say and still the
quest for the bravest cat will continue.
Still, Faith had a good st^rt; at least
she had a certificate to support her claim.

was also in Australia —at Frankston,
Victoria, 14 years ago. Wonga Park,
where the 10,000-odd scouts will pitch
their tents, is on the Yarra Brae pro-
perty of the Hon. Lewis Clifford, near
Lilydale. Scouts are to bring their own
camping-gear, but they will have more
than the traditional campfires to keep
them company—parking space, a shop-
ping centre, baby-creches, lounge accom-
modation, post-office facilities, bank
agencies, refreshment booths, electric
light and a cinema.

“Macnell”: In ansWer to “Castle-
reagh’s” disparagement of Grenville’s
fight (B, 20/10/’4B), I would remind him
that to close with the enemy, regardless
of the odds, has always been the accepted
course of action in the British Navy.
Jervis Bay against Admiral von Scheer,
cruisers against Graf Spee in the Battle
of the Plate, Perth’s fight surrounded by
Jap cruisers and destroyers—the list is a
long one, and in most cases the British
ships could have turned and run. The
fact that they did not is a simple vindi-
cation of R.N. tradition, just as simple
as Grenville’s problem—he was in a war-
ship, there were enemy ships in sight, so
he engaged, anticipating Nelson’s dictum
“He can do no wrong who lays his ship
alongside that of the enemy.” His action
and that of Yarra were alike in many
respects. As “Castlereagh” mentions,
Grenville’s rate of fire was faster than
the Spaniards’; so, for that matter, was
Yarra’s, with 16 rounds per minute as
against an eight-incher’s seven, the
advantage, in both cases, being nullified
by the smothering weight of fire opposed
to both ships. From a strategical view-
point, Grenville’s was the greater fight—
he inflicted considerable damage, Yarra
did not. But comparisons are odious, and
it should be remembered that battles
are not so much actions between
machines as essentially battles of men.
Revenge and Yarra were commanded and
manned by men actuated by the same
tradition ; in the face of the enemy there
is no essential difference between the
Royal Navy of today and the wooden
walls of the Elizabethan sea-dogs.

that whisky is a bad mixer is at variance
with the report of G. R. Leighton to the
Scottish Board of Health after the “Loch
Maree Tragedy” in 1922. This all began
with some potted duck-paste sandwiches
which contained the toxin of Clostridium
hotulinum, the causative organism of
botulism. Of eight members of the party,
one drank whisky with his meal; he was
the only survivor. The toxin is unstable
to alcohol, say the bacteriologists, but to
eliminate any doubt as to the strength
necessary I feel whisky is the safest drink
to take.

“W.P.T.”: Sydney Domain on Sunday
afternoon is a tame place compared with
what it used to be. All the famous
Domain identities seem to have passed

short silk smock in
all weathers and
advocated that all
men should be simi-
larly attired. His
book. The Answer,
shocked many people
at the time; today
it might almost be
read in Sunday-
schools. There was
Percy Birunton, the
peanut king, who
pushed his peanut-
cart to the Domain,
addressed a large
audience on a variety
of subjects and then
sold his wares. Percy
once had a crack at
Parliament, but lost
his deposit, Paddy
Collins was known
as the one - eyed
penny poet. He
wrote topical verse
and sold the printed
slips at a penny a
copy. His effusions lacked literary
quality, but they sold well. He
wrote about boxers and archbishops,
murderers and heroes. Jack Bradshaw
was another of the penny poets —most of
his verses were about bushrangers. He
claimed to be the last of the Australian
bushrangers, also that he had been a cell-
mate in Darlinghurst jail with a State
Premier. “That Man Grey” had a cure
for everything. He talked on anything,
and sold an ointment he claimed was
made from goanna oil. One Sunday
when aeroplanes were still a novelty the
crowd left a Socialist named Judd, whose
stand was under a big Moreton Bay fig,
and rushed into the open to see an aero-
plane that flew over the Domain. Judd
shouted at them: “In a few years you
will be running into holes to get away
from those things.”
“Just a quarter of a pound of that , please."
“Bohemian”: Henare and Co. are

from Auckland to Kaikohe, to be
seasoned in salt water. Craftsmen will
shape and carve it, an outrigger will be
added, and the complete craft will be
launched at Waitangi. It has been sug-
gested that the canoe should be presented
to their Majesties, to be taken back with
them to the Old Country. There might
not be much room for it on the Serpen-
tine, but it has been suggested that an
exhibition of the canoe would bring in
something for charity. ,

escape in this manner his mates saved
their ration of soap to make his slipping
through the bars easier. Tourists seem to
swallow the incredible story. What I

“Koro Heke”: Lord George Bentinck

“Percy Pawnticket”: A serious-minded

Honor, to her! And let a tear
Fall, for her sake, in Stonewall’s beer.
The laugh stirred in me by the picture of
the heroine’s followers letting their tears
fall into Jackson’s liquor broke the
etiquette of laughing and applauding in
the right places that prevailed at such
gatherings. I suffered the embarrassment
of knowing that my burst of hilarity was
probably ascribed to the jealousy of a
rival entertainer. That knowledge
made it impossible for me to explain to
the elocutionist that he had the words
wrong. Nobody else seemed to notice
the error. Not once in the dozen times
I heard that reciter give the piece did I
hear him give the right words—“on Jack-
son’s bier.”

“Mac Hugh”: The Bull’s Head Inn (B.
8/9/’4B) had an early and close associa-
tion with Darling Downs pioneering. Its
founder, William Horton, was transported
from England at 13 and later was assigned
to Henry Stuart Russell, the original
owner of Cecil Plains station. Russell
rewarded Horton’s service by establish-
ing him at the Bull’s Head early in 1848,
Bill Horton’s history can be read in The
Genesis of Queensland, by the same
Russell whose name is perpetuated by
Mt. Russell, once a station property
owned by Jimmy Tyson; one of Too-
woomba’s main streets also bears the
name.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Melbourne Gram-
mar boys were thrilled recently when an
R.A.A.F. helicopter interrupted their
game of football to pick up Lord Mayor
Disney on the school oval. Melbourne’s
No. 1 citizen was determined to ascertain
what was wrong with his city and how
he could best cure traffic jams and park-
ing problems. Three hours’ hovering
taught him a lot. He is now preparing
plans to recommend to his council for
the complete re-designing of his city. An
old pilot with No. 2 Squadron, A.F.C.,
Disney Was in a service aircraft for the
first time in three decades.

“Benzedrine Jack”: All this bother in
the papers about the effects of my
favprite stimulant have led me to ponder
the problem carefully. To do this it is
necessary to go back a good way—to the
time when I took a mere two or three
tablets before a grog party or a night’s
swotting. Benzedrine is not, in my
opinion, habit-forming ; at least, no more
than any other habit. When fatigued it
induces an artificial gaiety and a useful
tolerance for alcohol which makes the
dullest party enjoyable. Two or three
tablets taken before a night’s swotting
enable one to work, with a high degree
of concentration, till morning. It takes
approximately 20 minutes to act and, sup-
posing the time of intake to be 11 p.m.,
the experimenter should work with un-
abated energy till breakfast. Appetite is
usually reduced, and about this time one
is often assailed by a terrific thirst which,
pubs being closed in the early mornings
in these degenerate times, is best
slackened with strong coffee.' A kind of
minor glow is sustained until lunch-time,
when the reaction sets in. More
benzedrine will dispel it, but the beginner
is usually content to go to sleep. The re-
action is, not surprisingly, intense fatigue.
And here lies the fatal defect of the
system as an aid to study—the inevitable
flaw in all credit systems: one works
approximately the same time, and sleeps
accordingly, only in large doses. How-
ever, since I have graduated to the 50 and
60 per diem class I have discontinued
study, and with it regular employment,
under a system of social security which
enables me to live quite comfortably and
pursue my hobby undistracted. The chief
value of benzedrine to me, at this stage
of my development, lies in its thirst-pro-
voking powers and the charming fact that
I am enabled to bear, and even enjoy,
the conversation of fools. I am now
steadily increasing my ration and investi-
gating the possibilities of going into busi-
ness as a psychoanalyst.
SOME DAY.
“Mr. Eugene Goossens, Conductor of the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, addressing the Rotary Club,
said that the day would comp when Sydney’s hero-
worship of famous cricketers and footballers would
be extended to musicians.”
Suppose some really eminent musician
Adown our city streets should stroll or lope,
D you think there’d be a sudden ebullition
Of worshipful excitement? Not a hope!
He’d look around in vain for recognition,
Crowds wouldn’t know him from a bar of
soap,
A saddening comment on how small a part
Is played in our economy by Art.
How changed the scene, how different the story,
• When one is marked who, for our country’s
good,
Has blazed a track to fame, a path to glory,
By tapping leather with a piece of wood!
And what a welcome, rendered con amore.
Meet tribute to heroic hardihood,
Ever awaits the craftsman of unique
Proficiency with mashle or with deck!
The jock whose record’s rich with racing
brackets,
The pug who puts his rivals in the soup,
The chaps who smash their way with flashing
rackets
To where the Wimbledon spectators whoop,
What front-page news they make! What bulg-
ing packets
Of laudatory paragraphs they scoop,
What hearty adoration they must sense
Along with more substantial recompense!
But you who pluck from instruments their
treasures, •
Enrich the world with captivating song,
Set dancers tripping to melodious measures,
Merchants, in short, of what it wouldn’t be
wrong
To designate as more esthetic pleasures,
Keep up your peckers; for it won’t be long,
Goossens predicts, before you get your due
Of hero-worship. Maybe poets, too.

! Excluding replacement reserve, now £ 202,302.
The leap of £102,289 in the latest profit
figure was due almost entirely to reduced
provision for taxation (£212,700, down
£100,100), following abolition of War-
time (Co.) Tax. The £104,185 set aside to
meet this tax in 1947, but not required,
has been added to free reserves. Allowing
for this, last term’s net result was £1896
less than the previous year’s at 25.8 p.c.
on capital as against 26, 9.7, 11.1, 11.1,
12.6, 12.2 and 15.3 p.c. back to 1941. A
“special” distribution of Is. a share, from
excess tax provision, was sent out with
the \2\ p.c. div., making 17£ p.c. for the
year, the average handout over the last
eight years being 10.8 p.c.
The allowance for depreciation, etc.,
last term was £77,808 (up £13,553) equal
to 9.6 p.c. of the book-value of freeholds
and plant combined at end June. The
figure is liberal compared with what the
taxgatherer permits, but it is no more than
prudent commercial practice under exist-
ing and probable future conditions, and
therefore important from the investment
point of view. Broadly speaking, if the
replacement cost of fixed assets is sub-
stantially higher than original cost, arid
likely to remain so, then allowance for
depreciation at the lower level will permit
of replacement only in diminishing
quantity, and new capital would have to
be raised to make good the failure to
maintain existing capital instead of ex-
pand the volume of production. This also
raises the question for the Government:
Whether current tax revenues are not
made up in part of something that is
really not profit but capital?
The co. is the biggest and one of the
most efficient textile manufacturers in the
Commonwealth. Earnings of its own mill
at Abbotsford (Vic.) are supplemented by
those from a branch spinning and weaving
factory at Dandenong (Vic.), which began
production a year or so ago, and by divs.
from two subsidiaries —Globe Worsted
Mills Pty., Marrickville (N.S.W.), whose
plant is comparable in nature and size
with that of the parent, and Byfas Pty,,
Abbotsford, which turns out dress goods.
Last term turnover stepped up £84,020,
reaching a record £2,492,023 ; but the co.
had to work a 44-hour week to do it,
with consequent heavy increase in the cost
of production. Sales abroad were lower,
the Government having restricted the co.’s
export quota ; still, they accounted for “a
considerable portion of the year's profit.”
What the future holds for the co.’s
export trade will depend largely upon the
relative trend of costs locally and abroad,
and upon what ultimately happens in
connection with exchange rates. Locally
a seller’s market continues, but how long
it will do so is doubtful. Aggregate plant
capacity in the industry exceeds current
production, which is beginning to catch
up with demand, and the withdrawal of
subsidies and recurrent wage-lifts mean
a substantial rise in selling prices. What
effect this will have upon consumer de-
mand remains to be seen ; it will certainly
make overseas competition a factor
more to be reckoned with than hitherto.
The market, which notes that the co. is
well equipped,, financially and otherwise, to
meet competition and other contingencies,
prices the f.-p. pound shares at 655. 3d.
as against 60s. 6d. a year ago. The return
at the higher figure is 5.3 p.c. on a \l\ p.c.
distribution, or 3.8 p.c. should the rate
drop to 12i p.c. Net tangible cover is
345. 2d., excluding ss. 3d. in the replace-
ment reserve.
There is nothing to worry about in the
financial structure: 1 —

This big holding co., with headquarters
at Sydney, has a paid capital of £775,000
in 850,000 £1 shares, of which 750,000
are f.-p. and the balance paid to ss.
each. Its string of subsidiaries are en-
gaged in island-trading, shipping, insur-
ance, etc., and their spheres of activity
extend mainly from New Guinea out over
the South Seas to Fiji, and to Vancouver
and London as well.
During, and since, the war the
parent has accumulated more cash than
it can find profitable employment for in
the business, now or in the foreseeable
future. So the board proposes to return
10s. of each f.-p. share, which is then
to be split into two shares f.-p. to ss.
each. At the same time the uncalled
15s. on each of the 100,000 contribs. is
to be cancelled. This will call for, a
return of £375,000, or 57.3 p.c. of the
holding of cash (£422,646) and Govern-
ment securities (£231,922) at end' June
last. It will also reduce paid capital to
£400,000 in 1,600,000 shares of ss. each,
and will have no very marked effect
upon earning-power. Also the £400,000
of capital will have the support and
assistance of £465,063 of reserves.
Among other things, it will all make pay-
ment of a higher rate of dividend on the
reduced capital an easy matter.
The Jap invasion interrupted a flow of
10 p.c. divs., but the co.’s Fiji insurance,
shipping and other interests kept the pot
boiling, and a steady 5 p.c. was paid for
the five years to 1946, followed by 7|
p.c. and then 9 p.c. last term. Average
net earnings were £111,826 for the five
years to the close of accounts in 1941,
£71,339 for the next five war years, when
a large part of the co.’s trading area fell
into enemy hands, and £73,349 for the
two rehabilitation years to the close of
last accounts. These averages were equal
to 27.9 p.c., 17.8 p.c. and 18.3 p.c. re-
spectively on £400,000 of capital.
Subsidiaries operating in ex-enemy-
occupied territories have not yet re-
gained their full earning-power. How-
ever, the chairman says the offshoots in
New Guinea, Fiji and elsewhere are now
functioning satisfactorily, good progress
is being made and earnings are favorable.
But the Solomon Islands and Gilbert
Islands subsidiaries remain inactive, owing
to lack of transport and difficulties asso-
ciated with native labor. The parent’s
own Fiji interests were transferred to a
new subsidiary (Pacific Products, Ltd.) last
term, leaving it wholly a holding co. At
the moment there are no signs of any
fundamental weakness developing in the
markets for copra, seed-oil and other
island produce, though sooner or later
some recession from the present excep-
tionally high level of prices can be ex-
pected.
The Sydney sharemarket prices the
f.-p. scrip at 475., for which the investor
will receive 10s. cash plus two f.-p. ss.
shares* at an average cost of 18s. 6d. each.
At 18s. 6d. a ss. share would return 4 p.c.
on a 15 p.c. div. basis. On £400,000 of
capital a 15 p.c. div. would call for
£60,000, which is £ll,OOO-odd less than
average net earnings for the five most
difficult war years. The price of the
contribs. fell from 235. in July to 19s.
following announcement of the board’s
proposals.

As the eye sweeps down the profits
column in the table it should be remem-
bered that for over a decade retailers
generally have enjoyed a sellers’ market,
owing to war and post-war inflationary
and other influences. One result has been
a continuous growth in turnovers, the
measure of which the following table
illustrates —the figures show the per-
centage change in aggregate sales of a
dozen Brisbane department stores com-
pared with the corresponding period of
the previous year: —■

Although gross percentage margins have
tended to narrow as prices rose, and
costs have persistently taken more of each
year’s takings, expanding turnover has
thus far worked the trick so far as net
earnings are concerned.
Last term McWhirters, whose store is
at the Valley end of the city, made its
best showing for the last 21 years, despite
a steep rise in operating costs. The im-
provement in gross earnings (£379,967)
was £40,697, of which exes. (£304,778)
took £35,574, leaving the net result £5123
stronger at £75,189. That was 13.6 p.c. on
capital as against 12.7, 12.9, 11.8, 10.6,
9.4, 7.4 and 6.3 p.c. back to 1941. Only
half a point was added to the div., lifting
it to 8 p.c. and making the average over
the last decade 7.5 p.c., compared with
4.5 p.c. for the five years before that.
Discerning shareholders will not quarrel
with the policy of keeping the div.
moderate and strengthening reserves, now
equal to 10s. sd. per f.-p. pound share, or
nearly double the figure of five years ago.
The financial position improved:

debts and £19,574 to fixed assets the board
drew upon cash, etc!, for £81,770 and
went to the bank for a further £73,654.
The year’s improvement in the more-or-
less liquid surplus (£440,359) was £14,366.
As for the current term, trade so far
remains buoyant in the northern capital;
but with the persistent rise in prices, fol-
lowing wage-lifts and abolition of sub-
sidies, the public is becoming steadily
more discriminating in its- purchases.
At 325. 3d. (31s. 6d. a year ago) the
scrip returns a satisfactory 5 p.c. on an

Australia’s most comprehensive maker
of silica bricks and. other refrac-
tories used, in lining furnaces, Newbold’s
has been extending its capacity substan-
tially to meet the requirements of our new
heavy industries. Both fixed assets and
paid capital have more than doubled since
1939, when the board acquired rights to
manufacture special firebricks under
licence from U.S.A.
Though one of the co.’s best customers,
the iron-steel industry* is still forced to
operate well below capacity and the
national need, the general demand for re-
fractories has risen in accordance with ex-
pectations, However, Newbold’s own
output is hampered by shortages of labor
and materials. Efforts to reopen the
Wollongong works have been unavailing,
while the other factories at Waratah,
Thirroul and Port Kembla (N.S.W.) can’t
take full advantage of their increased pro-
ductive scope.
Most of the necessary silica, alumina
and other materials are drawn from earth-
deposits leasedl in N. S. Wales, the oldest
being at Ulladulla. Clay reserves are evi-
dently ample enough to make any
“mining” element in the co.’s profits in-
significant ; the deposits are subject, for
the most part, to very moderate Crown
rentals, and they don’t appear to be
treated as assets in the books:

Half-way through last term an issue of
108,000 £1 shares at ss. premium enabled
the board to wipe out most of the over-
draft whilst adding a net £76,787 to fixed
assets (after £lB,OBO was written off to
depreciation). The new term has com-
menced with debtors £25,546 less and
stocks £12,852 less than in June, 1947, but
plant capacity higher by about 20 p.c.
Proposed developments in the steal,
metal-refining and general engineering in-
dustries should give Newbold products a

An important factor
in developing the
Dairy Industry
From its beginning on the lovely foothills of
Illawarra (N.S.W.) early last century, the Aus-
tralian Dairy Industry has needed much capital
and much periodic financing to bring it to its
present size.
For 114 years this Bank has catered to these
V
needs. Its funds and its services to its customers
have been an important factor in developing the
Dairy industry.
About 75,000 farmers produce all our milk and
the foods that are made from' milk. The volume
of their output might well be greatly increased
and this Bank has the funds to assist progressive
farmers in increasing it.

overhead costs are bound to re-
main a problem whilst labor is
scarce. A full year’s dividend
on the augmented capital at last
year’s 6 p.c, rate will call for
£32,400 ; that is £3407 more than
last year’s profit, which repre-
sented 6.3 p.c. on mean capital
employed, compared with 6.7
p.c. and 6.4 p.c. in the two previ-
ous terms. So far the board’s
policy has been to distribute
most of the co.’s takings as
earned. It took 25 years for re-
serves to reach £44,332 before
the recent addition of share-
premiums, and they are still
modest in relation to paid capi-
tal. On book-values each £1
share (there are no prefs.) has
net asset backing of 225. 7d.; at
the current ’Change price of 28s.
the yield is 4.2 p.c. assuming an
unchanged div. this term.
Peninsula Tin (paid capital
£199,387 in 10s. shares) re-
possessed its property at Lang-
suan (Siam) in March last, but
doesn’t expect to get its
160,000-c.y.-a-month dredge dig-
ging again till March, 1949. The
Siamese Government, which had
already handed the co. 600,000
ticals (about £554,545), has just
authorised a further advance of
£522,608. Both amounts are to
be charged against the co.’s
claim for war damage. In
November, 1941, there were
26,350,000 c.y. of 0.751 b. ground
ahead of the dredge, of which
the Japs treated 1,311,755 c.y.
Reboring of original leases in
1937 indicated further reserves
of 2\ million c.y, of 0.41 b. dirt.

accounts in 1941 divs. averaged

National Oil Pty.
During the year to December
last National Oil Pty., Ltd.,
working the Newnes-Gapertee
shale-oil deposits at Glen Davis
(N.S.W.), produced 4,063,628
gallons of petrol, compared with
3,696,981 gallons in 1946 and
1,979,511 gallons in 1945. The
aim of 10,000,000 gallons a year
is thus still far from being
achieved. Not enough shale is
being mined, and inferior
material was put through the
plant last year, recoveries being
51 gallons of erude oil to the
ton of shale, compared with a
laboratory assay of 61 gallons
to the ton, and actual recoveries
of 56 gallons and 45 gallons re-
spectively in the two preceding
years. Recovery of petrol in the
cracking plant has averaged
about 48 p.c. in past years.
Over the last two years the
loss on operations has averaged
more than 2s. a gallon of petrol
produced. Aggregate losses since
commercial production of petrol
commenced have been:

1946 .. .. .. .. 401,830
1947 425,106
Losses to Dec. 31, 1947. .£2,032,883
The original share capital was
£325,000, subscribed principally
by George Davis, of the gela-
tine concern; the N. S. Wales
Government put up £166,000 on
debentures, and the Common-
wealth Government has ad-
vanced £3,491,735, including
£325,229 on account of the Fish
River water-supply. Other lia-
bilities totalled £591,811 at
December 31, 1947.
If the miners did a fair thing
the results would be better.
Capacity production might make
a considerable difference to unit
costs. Operated at under half-
capacity, however, it is plain that
it is costing over 3s. 6d. a gallon
to produce motor spirit, and
costs grow higher as the interest
bill on money advanced to meet
losses increases. Still, it is an
attempt to do something with
the country’s rich, though
limited, oil-shale resources.
Maoriland Pines and Pulp
Last year’s reorganisation
seems to have brought the dawn
of a better day for Whakatane
Board Mills, Ltd., N.Z.’s suc-
cessor to Whakatane Paper
Mills, which had a 22-year
struggle to get going and didn’t
pay a penny in divs. The new
co.’s first profit of £57,715 (year
ended June) compares with
£31,763 earned by the old con-
cern just before it went out, and
shows a margin of £12,233 over
the amount required to pay 5 p.c.
on all shares, prefs. and ords.
Cardboard production reached
£902,356, against £656,509
last year. Chairman G. H.
Mackley, M.P., hints that the
co. might be linked up with
the State in a public-utility co.
to be formed to manufacture
chemical pulp, newsprint and
other products of M.L.’s fast-
growing pine forests. U.S. ex-
perts, called in by the Govern-
ment, have been looking over
State forest areas, and will have
recommendations to make soon.
If moves to set up a big paper-
and-pulp plant mature, public
and, private enterprise will have
to join forces. There’s a lot
happening behind the scenes as
the stage is being set for forestry
exploitation which some think,
or hope, may some day dwarf
M.L.’s great dairying industry.
Korina Textiles
Now a big noise in N.Z.’s tex-
tile field, Korma Textiles (N.Z.),
Ltd., is carrying expansion to
the final stage under its ambi-
tious programme launched 2\
years ago by issuing 475,000
ords. to lift paid capital to a
million. A block of 155,000
shares goes to Felt and Textiles
of Australia, Ltd., with which
Korma threw in its lot in
November, 1947 ; 300,000 are
earmarked for existing share-
holders, on a share-for-share
basis, at par, and a meagre
20,000 are left for the outside
public.
Korma needs the money
to pay for its big mill and new
plant, likely to be completed and
in full swing early in 1949 at
Royal Oak, Auckland, Hosiery-
and worsted-manufacturing, with
“Less smile and more service, please !”
knitting, weaving, spinning and
other equipment, will collar a
large slice of the market that up
to now has gone to overseas sup-
pliers.
Australian backing is seen
in rising supplies of raw
materials and in technical know-
how on latest manufacturing
methods. Chairman Jim
Gentles said lately that problems
of pushing up output while
founding a group of new depart-
ments were plenty, but Aus-
tralian experts had found a way
through. While some M.L. cos.
are years behind with develop-
ment plans, Korma has shown
that even worst post-war ob-
stacles can be negotiated. Felt
and Textiles, in the background,
now has control of M.L.’s lusty
young textile industry firmly in
its hands.
The new capital being raised
by Australasian Paper and Pulp
(in which is merged Cumberland
Paper) will be one of the biggest
issues of the year. Pref. and
ord. holders will be offered
1,979,650 ords. at a premium of
ss. a share in the ratio of 80 for
100 of each class of scrip held.
The funds will be passed to the
operating co., Australian Paper
Manufacturers, which will also
issue £1,000,000 of debentures
privately during 1949-50. A.P.
and P. shares are sought after
at 38s, 6d., no sellers. The
operating co. makes Kraft paper
and cardboard.

Following “reports, from the
mine secretary” to the effect that
a crushing sent to the State bat-
tery had yielded 49y ounces
from 49 tons, with “an overall
average of 23.83dwt.,” shares in
Coolgardie Gold Mines, Ltd.,
rose from 1£?. 9d. to 16s. in Syd-
ney on Thursday of last week,
dropping a little later. Cool-
gardie is another one of those
200,000-share Pitt-street floats
at half-a-crown a pop that have
run up to a market price far
above ore-reserve values. The
value of the crushing announced
last week would be about £500:
the Pitt-street valuation of the
show is about £150,000.
Whacko!
* * * *
The new rate for francs on
sterling is 1061 francs to the £,
as against 864 francs hitherto.
The rate with the dollar —214
francs —remains unaltered. The
change will make it more diffi-
cult for French merchants to
buy goods in the sterling area
and sell them to the United
States for dollars that Britain
might have otherwise obtained
from a direct sale to the United
States, Helped by an improve-
ment in the balance of payments
beyond earlier anticipations,
sterling is in a stronger position
than it was this time last year.
« « * *
Mr. Chifley has indicated an
intention of keeping the Aus-
tralian pound at its present level
with sterling unless Britain re-
values sterling in relation to the
dollar. Some people, however,
think that he may be tempted
by rising costs to take the same
course as Maoriland, hoping
thereby to bring living costs
down and give a greater pur-
chasing-power to the revenue
and loan money that is raised
by the Federal and State Trea-
suries. But prices of land pro-
ducts are less stable than they
were, and the repercussions that
would follow a lowering of the
exchange rate might be viewed
more seriously than they would
have been a few months back.
The clamor for tax reductions
would also increase. There are
lots of reasons why Mr. Chifley
should be inclined to wait and
see how the Maoriland experi-
ment works out over a longer
period than has so far elapsed.
* * * *
The basic wage for Sydney,
from the first pay period in
November, will be 2s. higher at
£6 2s. Brisbane, also up 25., will
have a basic wage of £5 155.,
the lowest in the Common-
wealth. The average for the six
capital cities will be £5 19s.—
exactly £2 a week higher than
the corresponding figure for the
last quarter preceding the out-
break of war in 1939. The rise
in the basic wage since war be-
gan is thus a little more than
50 p.c.
» * ♦ ♦
At the end of June Australia’s
overseas funds totalled £273.5
million, an increase of £74.8
million compared with a year
earlier. Record exports of £407
million during the 12 months,
assisted by a bumper wheat crop
and high prices all round, are
principally responsible for the
large accretion to our London
funds.

From Herbert Holman
Territorial Army
The carefully-timed Com-
munist demonstrations during
the recent recruiting campaign
at the Mansion House caused
the memory of one ex-service-
man to slip back to a week-end
in early 1944. It was a “free”
leave, granted after a decisive
action on the Russian route.
Communist orators were then
imploring passers-by to “open
the Second Front NOW! ”
Characteristically, these soap-
box belligerents have now be-
come dewy-eyed pacifists. “No
war for the Yankee dollar” is
the parrot-cry against what the
“Daily Worker” calls “the drive
to war against Socialist Russia.”
The prospect of again putting
on uniform is no pleasant
thought to the bulk of the
4,000,000 “Z”-class reservists
who fought between 1939 and
1945 and who know that they
are still liable for recall. It
would be dishonest not to ad-
mit their reluctance to come for-
ward now as volunteers. Up to
six years of separation from
their families have been fol-
lowed by three years of frustra-
tion, in which desert dreams and
ocean longings remain unful-
filled, even in part. Hearts still
yearn for quiet homes, for
security and for peace. Or-
ganised demonstrations by
bands of fanatics can have no
effect but annoyance.
Much of what now passes for
apathy is due to a conflict be-
tween the heart’s longing and
the mind’s doubting. There
seems, to the ordinary citizen at
any rate, to be no solution to
the problem. So he ceases to
think about it and lapses into
silence. But he is bewildered
rather than apathetic.
If the need for Territorials is
urgent and vital, as it un-
doubtedly seems to be, the
country will rise as it has done
so many times in the past when
danger has threatened. But the
truth should be told and the facts
explained. However much Mr.
Shinwell may be respected in
some quarters, he is hardly
qualified to inspire the nation
as a whole; and Field-Marshal
Montgomery’s recent speeches
would seem to suggest that he
and his advisers are unaware of
the true feelings of the British
people in general.
The “Z”-class reservists are
citizen-soldiers of proved worth ;
but they are citizens first, and
they know well enough what life
in the Services means. The gov-
erning factor in their coming-
forward as volunteers will be
the responsibility of their citizen-
ship, which is their inheritance.
House-building
The White Paper recently
issued on the cost of house-
building promises no fall in
prices comparable to that which
occurred in the early ’2os, The
slump and cheapening imports
were then responsible. Of the
present post-war era the report
states that “the policy of full em-
ployment is intended to exclude
the possibility of a slump.
Should import prices continue to
rise the cost of house-building
may tend to rise also,” That
seems plain enough.
The report explains why the
typical local - authority three-
bedroom house which in 1938-39
cost £3BO now costs £1242 —that
is, three and a quarter times as
much. An average increase in
size from 800 sq. ft. to- 1029
sq. ft. accounts for £2Ol ; im-
provements in construction for
£127; increase in total cost of
materials for £472; overhead
charges and profit for £77; and
increases in the cost of labor for
£297. The total cost of labor
per house is three and a half
times the pre-war amount.
Of this £297 it is estimated
that £96 is due to increased
wage-rates and extra payments,
£75 to improvements in housing
standards, and £126 to what is
euphemistically styled “the de-
cline in productivity since
1939.” In eight years this has
led to an increase of some 45
p.c, in the number of man-
hours required to build a house,
and is equivalent to a 31 p.c. de-
cline in output. The causes are
stated to be “various and com-
plex,” and not solely due to
slacking (called “a general
lowering of individual output”).
Employment is “over-full,” and
“too many orders have been
chasing too few workers and
materials.”
Mention is made of the,waste-
ful effect of the “cost-plus” sys-
tem of contracting which came
into use during the war for
bomb-damage repairs and
emergency work. On this basis,
to take a long time and to spare
no expense is actually to in-
crease the profits, so that there
is no incentive for either con-
tractor or operative to get on
with the job. This go-slow
habit has spread to other
workers, and witnesses have
stated that skilled operatives
who returned from the forces
were not long before they fell
into line with the rest. The
statement that building under
private enterprise hat proved
faster than under local authori-
ties is qualified by an assertion
that the types of house are
different. ■
It would seem that the chief
incentive to good output is that
little bit of extra effort which is
needed to hold down a job. The
report stresses the need for more
positive incentives, for rewards
rather than penalties and for
new methods of encouraging
efficiency. Emphasis is laid upon
the importance of personnel
management, good working con-
ditions and welfare facilities for
building-workers.

"RUSTY BUGLES."
Sumner Locke-Elliott’s very
lively comedy “Rusty Bugles,”
which was banned last Fri-
day by that eminent intellec-
tual and cultural authority
J. M. Baddeley, N.S.W. Chief
Secretary, was presented again
on Saturday night at the Inde-
pendent Theatre because the pro-
ducer, Doris Fitton, had received
no official notification of the
ban. When this was written Miss
Fitton was still officially unaware
of it, and Mr. Clive Evatt,
N. S. Wales Minister for Hous-
ing, had promised to attend to-
morrow night’s performance and
report to Mr. Baddeley, who,
apparently, is too afraid that his
pink ears might be offended by
some of the dialogue to go along
and see for himself.
The methods of and reasons
for banning the play were the
same as usual, and as ridiculous
as usual. Two well-meaning
police officers saw the first per-
formance and reported to Mr.
Baddeley that it contained “blas-
phemous and indecent utter-
ances,” whereupon the Chief
Secretary fell upon it with Sec-
tion 27 of the Theatres and
Public Halls Act —“the Minister,
whenever he is of the opinion
that it is fitting for the preserva-
tion of good manners and de-
corum. .. .can prohibit or regu-
late the holding of any public
entertainment.”
In general, it is possible to
argue with Mr. Baddeley, in vain
probably, over the folly and
futility of banning plays, and of
the serious effect it has on
authors and producers by fright-
ening them away from anything
touching on sex or normal be-
havior. In particular, it can be
argued that since Sumner Locke-
Elliott is a young, serious-minded
Australian playwright who has
worked extremely hard and is
now making some headway in
America, and that since Doris
Fitton, with her Independent
Theatre, has done as much as
anyone else to keep the real stage
alive in Sydney by presenting
good plays for more than 15
years, neither of them are likely
to be purveying pornography
for profit. It might also be
argued that both of them
know considerably more about
what constitutes decent, intelli-
gent public entertainment than
does Mr. Baddeley.
Since Mr. Baddeley has not
seen it, however, it is not fairly
possible to argue with him about
the play itself. But it may be
pointed out that, although not a
major dramatic work, the play
is a cleverly-written observation
of a handful of Australian
soldiers in an ordnance depot in
the N.T. Inasmuch as the lan-
guage and behavior depicted is
common to any group of Aus-
tralians in factories, mines and
elsewhere it is not particularly a
play about soldiers. What it de-
picts accurately, intentionally or
otherwise, is the way any such
group of men talk and behave
under monotonous conditions, in
the Army or out of it. As a
record of that it is very good—
so plainly recognisable that it is
almost startling, in fact —and
merits its own particular place in
Australian playwriting.
Since Australian soldiers —or
miners or factory workers—
swear a good deal and talk about
women there is no reason why
they shouldn’t be depicted on the
stage as doing that —if Mr.
Baddeley holds such things are
a menace to “good manners and
decorum,” and wishes to smite
them with Section 27, he should,
logically, start shutting up pubs,
factories, smoke-ohs and any
other places where men fore-
gather. Actually the swearing
and antics in “Rusty Bugles” are
considerably diluted and disin-
fected. Most of the expressions
used wouldn’t perturb a maiden
aunt in these days, while the
others are sufficiently ile, pic-
turesque and true to have a fair
claim for inclusion in serious
dramatic writing.
The sum total of Locke-
Elliott’s play then is simply this:
It is a humorous (audiences
laughed practically all night) and
almost documentary record of a
dozen very bored soldiers whose
minds are, naturally, very con-
cerned with leave, beer and
women. As a healthy defence
against chronic boredom and
going troppo they swear, act the
goat and indulge in a good deal
of hard, humorous backbiting.
There is tittle authentic drama
or serious delineation of charac-
ter in the play; in fact, one or
two tentative attempts fail badly.
But it is highly amusing, and,
as a superficial record of a par-
ticular kind of human behavior
under particular conditions, it is
excellent.
The production, too, is excel-
lent, and, with one or two excep-
tions, the actors are so natural
that they might just have been
bundled into a Dakota at Gorrie
and dropped at Sydney for the
night.
Jocelyn Rickards.
“J.F.”: Entering the Mac-
quarie Galleries in Bligh-street,
Sydney, I was oppressed by a
nightmare feeling that I had
seen every picture before and
knew, without a shadow of
doubt, that in the second room
there would be a large painting
of a woman, that not far away
there would be a clown, and
that a flower-piece and a sad
Ophelia would be found some-
where about the sunlit front
room where the flowers (real)
flourish their colors so bril-
liantly below the window. And,
looking round the exhibition of
Jocelyn Rickards’s oil-paintings
and drawings, it was exactly as
I had contemplated.
This is a singularly unpleasant
sensation, for which psycholo-
gists doubtless have a name, and
in describing my reaction full
justice is not given to Jocelyn
Rickards’s undoubted talents—
her delicacy and hprmony and
the skill with which she con-
trols a line. Again, too, her
work suffers, not so much by
comparison as by surfeit; she is
the heir of all the other painters
who have painted clowns and
Ophelias and pale girls languish-
ing in pavilions and sylvan
groups of picturesquely-clad
young men and women with in-
terchangeable faces, and ex-
hibited them at the Macquarie
Galleries.
But the cumulative effect is
depressing. It is true, perhaps,
that the delicacy and subtle
nuances of tone and feeling are
in themselves admirable; it is
perfectly true that many of the
groups would make admirable
decor —in the right setting as
pale background for the vital
life of the theatre. But that life
and that vitality are missing.
There are, at best, hints of it.
There is a “Girl in a Red Coat”
with color at least; and a “Girl
with a Green Apple” in which,
despite a certain excess of green-
ness, there is a kindly grace..
But most of the paintings and
drawings look as though, at the
faintest hint of violence, they
are ready to fade into the wall;
they are delicate, whimsical,
cold. The real flowers in the
vase have a devastating effect
on the flowerpieces and the
flowerlike groups of human
figures.
Sydney Tiv.
One of the Kwam brothers,
at Sydney Tivoli, climbs a high
tower, pours two or three glasses
of beer, sets them on a tray and
then, balancing the lot, leaps
into space like an aerial bar-
tender, turns a somersault and
lands safely with the hops still
intact. Another member of the
trio places four empty beer-
bottles on a table and then sets
up a chair with a leg resting pre-
cariously on each bottle; he
climbs on to the chair, adds
another chair to it and climbs
on to that. And so on, with
patient Oriental industry, until
the tower of chairs reaches
almost to the ceiling and the
squat, smiling acrobat balances
upside-down on top of it, to the
amazement and consternation of
the spectators.
With similar recklessness
Walthon constructs an erratic,
untrustworthy see-saw by bal-
ancing a plank across a round,
spangled log, the whole lot being
set on a table about three by
four. Then, having performed
the improbable by balancing on
it and the impossible by juggling
while he balances, he finally ac-
complishes the incredible by
hauling his partner, Dorraine, on
to his shoulders while he bal-
ances and juggles.
Both good turns, but neither
of them more remarkable than
the others on the best vaude-
ville bill the Tiv. has offered for
a long time. Sugar Baba, for
instance, with the Rudas Twins
to catch her on the rare occa-
sions that she lands, spends most
of her time flying and spinning
through space with some of the
speed and most of the precision
of a Spitfire. Dancer Lynne
Golding flits about the stage
with similar speed and preci-
sion, Yvonne and Yvette go
through some back-breaking
acrobatics with calm, leisurely
grace, and, just as calmly and
leisurely, Micheline Bernardini
divests herself of clothing that
matters,
“Star” of the show is Gil
Lamb, from Hollywood, a lanky
ingratiating comedian who tests
the flexibility of his frame and
features to the utmost, tosses off
a steady stream of light innu-
endoes and brings the. house
down with an imitation of a
“hep-cat” and some assorted
renderings of “Little Jack
Horner.” In the same business
as Mr. Lamb are Billy Shake-
speare, from England, and
Terry Scanlon, from Sydney,
both good, bright patter mer-
chants who leave considerably
less to the, imagination than do
the brief, decorative trappings
of the Tivoli lovelies.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Indifferent weather brought wbmen to
the Moonee Valley Cup meeting in furs
and suits, but many of them defiantly
wore the gayest of hats. There were
small, flower-laden hats and large be-
ribboned straws, while one woman even
had a string of large white daisies under
her chin. Once again it was the woman
in the well-cut grey suit who led the*
fashion-field—Mrs. A. V. Pope relied on
a tan-and-grey printed-silk blouse to give
relief to her clerical-grey suit and match-
ing felt hat. Mrs. William Seymour also
chose grey suiting, and contrasted it with
a pale-yellow felt hat trimmed with
yellow-and-white ribbon. Mrs. A. Drake-
ford added a silver-fox cape to her grey
ensemble, and her grey felt hat was
trimmed with grey ribbon and veiling.
Mrs. W. L. Russell Clarke, wife of the
vice-chairman of the M.V.R.C., wore a
beautiful suit of beige-and-white chevron-
striped worsted, contrasted with a snuff -
toned blouse and felt hat. Mrs. A. L.
Walters was elegant in a beige kasha
tailored coat, her small straw hat trimmed
with London-tan satin ribbon and
plumage. Shoes and bag were of London-
tan.
Mrs. Fred Hammond chose a suit in
pale beige and contrasted it with a black
blouse and small, natural-straw hat
trimmed with’ black satin ribbon. Mrs.
Ken Luke, just returned from abroad,
was among those who chose navy-blue.
Her suit showed the trend for the longer
jacket worn with a full skirt, and her
navy hat had touches of red for contrast.
A sable dyed-mink stole completed her
ensemble. Another who chose navy-blue
was Mrs. Jim Buchanan, whose jacket was
belted across the back and skirt cut on
full lines. Her raspberry-red velvet hat
was trimmed with navy-blue veiling.
Mrs. Norman Lynch chose navy-blue, and
with her ensemble wore a white straw
sailor hat trimmed with navy-blue.
The chapel of Xavier College, the
’groom’s old school, was the setting for
the marriage of Molly, former W.R.A.N.
officer and only child of Mr. and Mrs.
J. C. Westhoven, Studley Park-road,
Kew, and Edward Joffre, younger son of
Mrs. E. L. Smiley, Barkers-road, Haw-
thorn, and the late Mr. Smiley. Molly
chose a gown of ivory net over satin
trimmed with hand-made flowers from
her mother’s wedding-gown. An orange-
blossom coronet held the filmy tulle veil,
and a bouquet of orange blossoms was
carried. Betty Conroy was bridesmaid,
and her frock of soft maize-toned mar-
quisette was fashioned with a bouffant
skirt and a tight-fitting bodice finished
with tiny puff sleeves. Dr. W. Calanchini
was best man.
Attractive Pamela, only daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Sallmann, of Dande-
nong-road. North Caulfield, has just an-
nounced her engagement to Norman
Cyril, younger son of Mrs. Steele, Lin-
lithgow-road, Toorak, and the late Mr.
Cyril Steele. With her parents, Pam was
a guest at the July 8 garden party, at
Buckingham Pajace when, with her
parents, she was presented to the King
and Queen. Her fiance has also recently
returned from a trip abroad.
With Naval efficiency, the entrance to
H.M.A.S. Lonsdale, the Naval establish-
ment at Port Melbourne, was covered in,
thus protecting pretty hats and coiffures
from the wind. Above H.M.A.S. Lons-
dale flew the flag of Rear-Admiral J. A.
Collins, who, with his wife, gave a late-
aftemoon party to round off the Trafalgar
Day celebrations. The band of H.M.A.S.
Australia played many lively tunes, and
among the guests were Captain H. M.
Burrell, of Australia, and Commander
F. N. Cook, of Arunta. Mrs. Collins re-
ceived her guests wearing a delightful
dusty-blue wool angora frock with full-
ness at the back of the skirt, and a tiny
hat in the same shade with a bunch of
black ospreys in the front.
With the second Naval member, Com-
modore H. A. Showers, was his wife,
whose navy-blue jacket suit was worn
with a red hat swathed with matching
tulle. Mrs. Morris Sallmann chose a
hip-length white lamb coat which she
wore over a black frock and with a small
white hat trimmed with white roses;
Lieutenant Tony Sallmann’s fiancee, Ann
Foley, wore an attractive beige suit and
matching silk straw bonnet. Wife of
the U.S.A. Naval Attache, Mrs. S. Jurika,
topped off her blue-fox cape and black
frock with a gay little chapeau of pink-
and-blue roses swathed with veiling.
Lady Blarney’s large upswept black hat
showed a primrose-yellow brim and
matched the accessories worn with a
black frock. Mrs. J. E. Hewitt added a
white straw platter hat to her black en-
semble.
Mrs. Disney, who was with her hus-
band, Lord Mayor Disney, chose a slim-
fitting black crepe romaine frock and
cape stole of silver-fox. Her high black
turban was covered with a lace face veil.
With Col. F. H. Wright, Consul for the
Netherlands, was Mrs. Wright, whose
choice was a hip-length black Persian-
lamb coat and black frock with a black
hat trimmed with primrose-toned flowers.
Mrs. Samuel Fletcher was with her hus-
band, the Consul-General for the U.S.A.,
and also chose a black ensemble and a
befeathered black hat. Other prominent
guests included Air-Marshal George
Jones and his wife, Lieutenant-General
V. A. H. Sturdee, Chief of the General
Staff, and Mrs. Sturdee, Lieutenant-
General and Mrs. C. Clowes and Lieuten-
ant-General and Mrs. S. F. Rowell.
Pensively gazing into the future is Mrs.
Herbert Leggett, the newly - elected
honorary corresponding secretary of the
American Women’s Auxiliary to the
Children’s Hospital. Mrs. Leggett is the
wife of a U.S.A. Vice-Consul in this city,
and has made Melbourne her home for
the last two years. She has a little
daughter, Kate, who was born in this
country. Mrs, Leggett comes from
Berkeley, California, and graduated from
the university of that State. Her favorite
hobby is collecting rare and unusual
jewellery—she started in Mexico some
years ago while still a university student.
Most of her cqUection has been acquired
on her travels over South America.
After weeks of tireless organising by
Mrs. Garnet Carroll and her committee,
“Fashion Fantasy” was presented at the
Princess Theatre and brought in £l5OO
for the United Nations Appeal for
Children. Those who helped Mrs. Carroll
deserve a lot of credit —the street frocks,
enchanting cocktail frocks, glamorous
evening gowns and luxurious furs were
presented in one of the best charity dos
seen in this city for some time. Topliners
from the Tivoli, Peter Grey and Daphne
Newton; of “Present Laughter,” and
Strella Wilson did a grand job on the en-
tertainment side, and Sally Gilmour and
Walter Gore presented “Bartlemas Fair,”
a new and unusual ballet. Madame Ram-
bert flew' from Adelaide to be present,
and received a great round of applause.
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. J. S. Disney,
smart in a black suit and attractive straw
boater and accompanied by her daughter-
in-law, Mrs. Alec Hay, was received bv
Lady Angliss, president of the women’s
committee of U.N.A.C.
Mrs. Garnet Carroll was most attrac-
tive in a beech-brown crepe frock and
wide-brimmed: coarse-straw hat which
had the brim trimmed with matching tiny
feathers. Mrs. Phillip Dare, who was in
charge of the fashion presentation, chose
a smart black ensemble and a black
taffeta beret with a head-hugging band of
natural straw. Mrs. Harold Holt also
chose black, but contrasted it with a
small, flat, white straw hat. Elsa Briese
wore an elephant’s-breath velvet coat
over a grey crepe frock and a matching
grey straw hat.
Mrs. Maurice Dowd trimmed her small
black hat with white taffeta ribbon bows,
and wore it with a smartly-cut black suit.
Mrs. Ralph Freedman’s navy-blue an-
gora ensemble was worn with a small
white hat trimmed with gardenias and
tied up with lime-green veiling. Lady
Hyde contrasted her leaf-green jacket-suit
with cinnamon-brown accessories; the
beige beefeater hat, with its swathing of
black tulle, worn by Mrs. A. Colman
topped off a natty black outfit. Mrs.
Ron Decker and Mrs. Henry Marks did
brisk business at the well-stocked pro-
duce stall in the foyer, and attractive
Carole Griffiths, in a blue-and-white
spotted satin frock and the newest trend
in gold kid sandals, sold programmes.
From Sydney
Sydney put vine-leaves in her hair last
week in keeping with the Great or City
Dionysia. Not that there were Bac-
chantes tripping in the parks, or fauns
fluting around the Archibald Fountain.
Nor did any poet take his typewriter
from behind his ear and dash off a
tragedy. Sydney’s wine week, alas, was
held in honor of none of the old-time
gods. It was to the glory of Industry
that the grape was crushed. One way
and another, however, there were festive
doings among winegrowers and wine-
merchants. The parties surrounded the
Conference of the Federal Viticultural
Association. All the wines served, from
the sherry to the champagne, were
Australian. Bright show of the week was
the dinner at the Carlton, hostessed .by
the women’s committee of the Wine Pro-
ducers’ Association.
Long before the first found of sherry
had been served the Jocelyn Rickards
exhibition was almost sold out. Pat
Garvan, all in a hurry to make Num-
ber 19 her own (it’s “Girl in a Painted
Pavilion”), was a picture herself —fair
slimness in a frock in two tones of green.
Worn with this was a huge hat of green
chip-straw, banded with ribbon-velvet.
The young painter greeted her guests,
looking as pretty as she always does. Her
grey-green frock was of a. soft fullness
and had a bright red rose tucked into the
V-neckline. There were no speeches at
all. Everybody knew everybody else, and
Tommy Cochran, up from Melbourne
and the MS. of his Memoirs, blessed
the show with his benign air.'
The paintings have elegance and the
colors are fresh and clear, and Jocelyn evi-
dently can give picture-buyers what they
want. • There’s a “Giselle” on the walls,
so like Sally Gilmour that probably it is
she. Mrs. Rickards was there enjoying her
daughter’s success, and Mrs. W, O’Hal-
loran’ Giles came from Adelaide for the
occasion. Charles Wilmot represented
the British Council. Mrs. Bernard Lowe
and Mrs. Neil Hutchison helped in the
entertaining. Grey seems the popular
toning among the artist colony. Hera
Roberts chose it for dress and hat, and
artist Margaret Olley’s linens were a cool
grey. Mrs. Ben Fuller, who leaves in
the Strathaird in December, talked of her
plans for her daughters, who are accom-
panying her. Golden-haired Alannah
Coleman wore a silky frock of mignonette
green. She carried a long-handled white
embroidered linen parasol, and an old-
fashioned red velvet beaded bag with a
draw string. The parasol, the gift of a
family friend, is almost 50 years old.
On the nights when soprano Rina
Malatrasi is Mimi in “Boheme,” or the
ill-fated Madame Butterfly, Melbourne
goes running to the opera. The Italian
star has a brilliant voice, charm and an
acting ability which makes her live the
parts she plays. The Italian Grand Opera
season opens in Sydney next month at
the Tivoli. Rina, as well as her sparkling
voice, will bring a sparkling engagement-
ring to this city. She and baritone Ferdi-
nand© Li Donni, of the company, were
affianced recently in Melbourne. Li
Donni is enrolled as a law student at
Rome University, and his father and
grandfather are both well-known lawyers.
He has sung with the 8.8. C. “Third”
programme, considered -one of the most
classical radio programmes in the world.
If summer comes, then winter’s close
behind. Moulded, but not tightly nipped-
in will be the waists seen in autumn
and winter frocks and coats. One thing is
certain, the rather Dorothy Draggle-tail
“new”-look is now old-look. The up-to-
the-minute woman is harking back to the
Napoleonic era, so that means a crop of
Directoire and Empire styles. Schia-
parelli features directoire coats in broad-
cloth made on fitted redingote lines with
set-in sleeves. But the tent-like swagger
coat is sponsored by good houses, like-
wise thigh-length coats with raglan or
batwing sleeves. Collars are high, once
again, which is a nuisance for most hair-
dos. There was an interesting display
of clothes created in Australia one after-
noon last week. These were paraded in
the Australia Hotel. Melbournite Dorothy
Laughlin had designed these advance
winter models. Many of her topcoats
fell in graceful fullness from the shoulders
—no moulded waistline. Her topcoats
often had scarf collars of contrasting
tones.
The 29th annual Poppy Day Appeal,
directed by the United Returned
Soldiers’ Fund, will be held throughout
New South Wales on November 5, the
Friday before Remembrance Day. In
the past, Armistice Day, November 11,
was set aside to commemorate the dead of
the First World War, but as there are
now two Great Wars to be remembered,
the Sunday nearest November 11 has
been chosen as Remembrance Day to
perpetuate the memory of those who
made the supreme sacrifice. Following
the usual custom, poppies will be sold on
the Friday before Remembrance Day.
The proceeds of the appeal help the three
organisations housed in the Anzac
Memorial. For services rendered, “Buy a
Poppy.”
The schoolchildren of this State have
worked nobly in the cause of the United
Nations Appeal for the children of
Europe, and last Friday on behalf of all
the State schoolchildren of New South
Wales a cheque for £18,829 was handed
to the Reverend B. R. Whyllie. Mr.
Whyllie is Master of Wesley College
within the University, but it was as hon.
secretary for N.S.W. United Nations
Appeal for Children that he received the
precious gift. When the last shekel is
garnered from State, private and de-
nominational schools the final amount
should be over £23,000. Evan Simon, of
Katoomba High, and Marlene Nolan, of
Riverside Domestic Science High School,
were the children chosen to present
Friday’s cheque.
Of rich cream and gold Italian brocade
was the wedding frock worn by
dark-haired Diana Roche, who married
Dr. Tom Frost in St. Joseph’s Church,
Edgecliff, last Wednesday night. Diana is
the eldest daughter of the John D. K.
Roches, of Cranford, Edgecliff, and the
bridegroom is the elder son of the late
T. M. Frost and of Mrs. Frost, of Rand-
wick. Judy, Jennifer and Josephine
Roche, the bride’s sisters, and Colleen
Frost, the ’groom’s sister, were the brides-
maids. Their frocks were pale gold in
tone —pleated tulle over satin sashed in
turquoise. Wedding reception was at
Cranford. ,
St. Augustine’s Church at Neutral Bay
was warm with late-afternoon sunshine
When Pat Burge and Joe Scholey Bragg
were married. The pews were tied with
white ribbons, there were soft waves of
organ music and the fragrance of
flowers. The bride was dressed in
white-slipper satin, made with a medieval
bodice and slim, wrist-fitting sleeves. The
train, cut into the skirt, flowed out from
a large soft bow. On her pretty dark
head she wore a short tulle veil sur-
mounted by a Juliet cap of seed-pearls.
Pale-blue satin, soft and very full, was
younger sister Joy’s bridesmaid’s frock.
The masses of lily of the valley carried by
Pat had been air-mailed from Melbourne
by Mrs. Hogrefe senior.
Reception after the wedding was held
at Eianora Country Club, and driving
there the guests who took the French’s
Forest road were somewhat saddened by
ttie havoc being wrought by the bushfires.
There were about 70 guests, and the party
went on, and went on. Pat’s parents, the
H. R. Burges, and the ’groom’s mother
and father, Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Bragg,
did the honors.
When Annette Webb* becomes Mrs. H.
Cary, on Nov. 3, at Molong, she will have
Beatrice Pattison, Marcelle Reynolds and
Pamela Aumuller for bridesmaids. The
last goes hasting with masses of lily-of-
the-valley and the lobsters for the
wedding. Reception at the home of
Annette’s parents, the Bruce Webbs, of
Copper Hill, Molong.
Rev. Father Tom Walshe, one of this
city’s foremost lecturers on literature, will
be the speaker at the English-Speaking
Union’s literary circle tomorrow after-
noon. His subject will be Shakspeare’s
“King John.” The circle meets in
Anthony Hordern’s Art Gallery at 2.30.
The Spastic Centre at Mosman has
many friends, among them the staff of
McNiven Bros., Ltd. This firm is hold-
ing its ball in Paddington Town Hall on
October 29 to aid the centre. Stewart
Allen’s band and a glittering floor-show
are among the attractions.
A bright week-end was given an extra
burnish by the Hayseed Party, at the
Point Piper home of Mr. and Mrs. Sam
Lands. Food for Babies fund benefited ;
the Chow Line in the home of Mrs. Roy
Harrison, for the American-Australasian
Ex-Servicemen’s Club; and the Buffet

Missing Friend.
CUNNINGHAM, Bernard.—A NYO N B
knowing the whereabouts of the above-

THE SERVICE MAN
TWENTY HOURS TO HIROSHIMA
From "EK DUM" in Japan
One of the most arresting facts
about the city of Hiroshima is
that it is not so very far away.
It is not so far off in terms of
modern travel as Sydney was
from Brisbane in World War I.
In 1918 the train was still the
fastest mode of ordinary pro-
gress between Brisbane and Syd-
ney, and it took 25 hours on the
journey. The motor record was
slightly faster—23 hours 37
minutes actual running. In
1948 Hiroshima is roughly 234-
hours’ actual flying time from
Sydney by the superb British
Lancastrians, manned by the
superb Qantas crews, plus a
couple of hours by launch or
car. •
You soar out of Mascot at
8.30 p.m., rise above the spec-
tacle of Sydney’s carpet of lights
to 10,500 ft., where you have
nothing but the stars and the
cabin-heater for company. At
5.30 a.m. next morning you are
taking in two greasy eggs and
brown tea in the horrible air-
transport mess of the R.A.A.F.
at Darwin—the R.A.A.F. ameni-
ties there are a disgrace to the
country. You soar out into the
Timor Sea, reach for the sky
and at intervals peer into the
void at Bathurst, Amboina,
Halmahera, the long tail of
Celebes and finally make across
section of Mindanao, skirt the
coasts of the other Philippines,
to come in over the centre of
Manila Bay, with Manila’s
tongue at Cavite stuck out at
you on the right and Corregidor
like a tadpole swimming out of
the harbor under the frowning
ridge of Bataan. In a few
minutes the rain-soaked paddy-
fields on the northern side have
been swept away and you are
absorbed, early in the afternoon,
into/the vastness of Clark Field,
on the edges of the Lingayen
Plain, wondering how you are
going to sustain and refresh
yourself for 17 hours on the
dollar and a half which your
great nation doles out to you to
sustain its dignity in foreign
parts, with single-nip Budweiser
at about one and ninepence. Any
Australian air - traveller who
cannot play the poker-machine
leaves Clark Field a living skele-
ton and with a hangdog look.
Typhoon Region
From Clark Field it is nor-
mally seven hours to Iwakuna,
though with Libby, our typhoon,
sitting over Okinawa, we swing
over to Formosa and the
Chinese coasts and make it in
not much more time. The sight
of the first bits of Japan seen on
this route is something unfor-
gettable—the Goto Islands. They
do not look like anything that
belongs to this world, but rather
as if they had been painted on
a sapphire sea by one of the
Daughters of Joy sitting on a
star.
Just as you are rejoicing in
this amazing series of composi-
tions in red earth, green crops,
dark pine-trees and iridescent
sea it all disappears in a ball of
cotton-wool, from which you
emerge an hour later, your
record of prayer considerably
improved, at Iwakuna, which is
on a large mud-flat at the wes-
tern side of Kure’s noble
gulf. It is opposite Etajima,
the delightful island on which
8.C.0.F, headquarters are
lodged in the old naval academy
and where the relics and spirit
of Admiral Togo are accessible
directly from the vestibule of
the 8.C.0.F. Gift Shop in a
little shrine. Within an hour or
two of water journey over an
expanse of anchorage resem-
bling the Scottish lochs you are
within easy reach of Hiroshima.
Going to Hiroshima
Hiroshima is about an hour’s
run from Kure by an excellent
motor road, as motor roads go
in wet country in which they
haven’t yet properly learned to
camber. The gutters on each
side abut the walls of diamond-
shaped granite blocks which
hold the sliding hills, so like
those of Rabaul, in place. They
have sheer sides, and are any-
thing from a foofc to 10ft. deep.
The road is for the most part
level. Where it touches hills it
goes through them. One tun-
nel, a post-war Japanese project,
is four and one-tenth miles long.
It is some time after penetrat-
ing this, when the track narrows
between the eternal lines of pic-
turesque hovels, that you see, on
the right, through the driving
rain, a large, intact brewery
which marks the beginning of
Hiroshima.
It is easy to understand why
Hiroshima was selected for the
atom-bomb experiment. It was
the H.Q. of the Japanese
Second Army. It had a vast
troop-embarkation centre. It
was in a basin surrounded by
hills save on the sea side, and,
standing out on its low-lying flat
amid its six river-channels, these
were . prominent landmarks.
Otherwise Hiroshima has noth-
ing much to distinguish it. Save
for its half a dozen imposing
public buildings and banks and
its large Japanese Red Cross
hospital it was the usual mixed
bag of rain, ricefields, hovels
and children. All the inhabi-
tants ride bicycles, on which
they carry anything from a hair
trunk to a bale of hay. When it
is raining, as it was when we
were introduced to them, they
do their riding with their left
hands while holding in the right
a large, unmanageable bamboo
umbrella.
The progress of an immacu-
late staff car through a Hiro-
shima street so narrow that
passing trucks have scraped the
sides of the telegraph-poles
almost flat is something to
watch if the human game in
sight happens to consist of a
motor-tricycle with eight people
hanging to it like caterpillars, 15
bicycles ridden by mixed sexes,
all with umbrellas up, a Jap-
driven bus, a cow dragging a
sanitary tumbril, 27 ladies toting
babies on their backs or the
family furniture carried on a
sort of ladder. It then becomes
plain why only 78,000 Japanese
were killed by the atom bomb.
Death flatly refuses to associate
even now with the inhabitants
of Hiroshima. If the grim old
fellow were eager for their com-
pany not a Hiroshiman would
today be above the ground. On
that marshy, river-divided flat,
much of it under sea-level, they
live amid all the germs of the
Orient in streets which are
sometimes half under water,
tempting Providence, apart from
native and traffic risks, by such
expedients as taking up a couple
of paving-stones on the footpath
and filling the vacancy with a
fine crop of turnips fertilised
with nightsoil.
New Tourist Centre
Yet they live. Thousands of
them are as round as dumplings.
They are proud and pleased at
being Hiroshimans, residents of
an historic city—the “Atomic
City”—which is coining money
from the tourist traffic, in which
a limp caused by falling off a
bicycle is worth as much* as the
old-age pension, and agea panta-
loons who scarred themselves
with the wrong end of a toma-
hawk in their youth consider
themselves licensed to practise
the imaginative arts. But not
upon the Atomic Commission,
which has been set up by the
Americans and is at present
headed by Dr. Carl Tessmer, a
young Permanent Army patholo-
gist who regards imagination,
where atom-bombs are con-
cerned, as a sort of disease, and
is laying the groundwork of an
inspiring scheme. Under this it
is hoped that in a couple of
generations a small army of
' patient radiologists, geneticists,
soil-surveyors, entomologists and
gynecologists, along with statis-
ticians armed with the most
modern and superhuman index-
ing and classifying machines,
will persuade truth in all things
connected with atom-bombing
effects to emerge from the murk
and declare herself.
At present it is useless to ask
Dr. Tessmer about all the hor-
rors of hybridisation and mal-
formation which are popularly
believed to result from contact
with the atom. He insists that,
in the absence of data and scien-
tific controls for purposes of
comparison, there is little infor-
mation which is not strictly
clinical at present. It is, there-
fore, well to leave him and
splash through the pockmarked
streets to the Town Hall, where
his Worship the. Mayor has
been requested by the powers to
be to receive us.
Atomic Mayor at Home
His Worship is discovered in
his sanctum, which is a plain,
bare room in his rehabilitated
municipal building, a depressing
“It's the only Way I can get them through the
Customs, sir."
place in which every inhabitant
was killed by the bomb. He is
a long Japanese in a blue suit
and white socks, and he is ac-
companied by an unfriendly-
looking entity who proves to be
the Chief of Police.
The Mayor is a lawyer, and
he, like all Mayors, fortunately
owns a Mayoral locker. He ob-
viously bears no malice at being
bombed. Like most citizens of
Hiroshima he seems to feel that
great honor was done his city
when it was selected for destruc-
tion. He himself, it appears,
was a bomb victim. When the
horrible thing fell he was in
process of putting on the
Mayoral coat and trousers about
three kilometres from the epi-
centre of the explosion. With
great promptitude he leaped for
the floor, but too late to avoid
some burns. Glass flew in a
cloud above him, and the clothes
in the wardrobe careened across
the room. His Worship roars
with laughter at his own dis-
comfiture. We express the hope
that in future there will be no
need to throw atom-bombs at
each other, a sentiment which is
obviously popular even with the
Police Chief, who, so far,
through 20 minutes of inter-
preted talk has done nothing
save move a stony eye from our
necks to our ankles as if mea-
suring the length of chain
needed for jailing purposes,^
Where the Bomb Fell
So far on our travels we have
seen little destruction save the
battered front of a repaired
building or a gaping space
planted with sweet potatoes. But
there is the empty framework of
a dome in the distance which
promises better excitement. This
was the arriving-point of the
bombers. It stands on a triangle
of land beside a river which
looks and smells like a tannery,
only more so, A concrete bridge
and a main street run across
the river about 100 yards from
the wrecked dome, which tops
the remains of the Chamber of
Commerce Exhibition building.
Beside the bridge is the main
Chamber of Commerce building
on the south of the dome ; on
the north of it is a wireless mast
similar to the ordinary broad-
casting lattice mast which be-
longed to the post-office. It was
directly over these buildings that
the bomb gave its first splutter
5000 ft, in the air and then went
off fully at 1700 ft.-odd.
The explosion’s effect was like
that of a giant red-hot hammer
brought down on the top of the
adjacent buildings and surfaces.
Everything not of reinforced
concrete came down perpendicu-
larly. What would not break
buckled. The walls of the Com-
merce Exhibition building were
concertinaed. The Chamber
across the road had its eaves
bent, giving it the look of a
respectable citizen who has had
his hat-brim pulled down by a
joking boy. One huge stone-
and-concrete footway the whole
length of the bridge was spurned
aside as a boot spurns a banana
skin. The post-office disap-
peared completely, and every-
body in it. All that remains of
it is some blistered tile which
could have fused only in a
temperature of over 3000 de-
grees. The stonework for hun-
dreds of yards on the further
side of the river 'was torn out.
In the Bankers’ Building, 1200
yards from the centre, only one
person in 200 survived —a little
telephoniste in one corner. When
the bomb arrived a citizen was
sitting on the steps. History will
never know who he was. All
that remains is his shadow
grimly photographed on the
stone.
The main part of the blasted
area is to be retained for ever
as a memorial and a reminder.
And the Children’s Cultural
Association has erected in its
forefront a solid monument —
which looks as if it had been
built to be bombproof —on
which some sign-painter has de-
picted the Chamber of Com-
merce Exhibition building “be-
fore” and “after” in lurid color,
on each side of a bas-relief
motif of which the features are
an atom-bomb exploding and
two doves (which look very
fierce) bearing olive branches.
The Lone Patient
All round the ruin among the
raw, new wooden shacks and
freshly-grey concrete shops the
merry citizens of Hiroshima,
mostly as fat as butter if they
are young, roam about visiting
the exhibition of Hiroshima’s
products in the building with its
hat-brim round its ears and
pointing out profitably to visitors
the city’s new and appropriate
motto: “No More Hiroshimas.”
To the casual eye there is no
evidence that the city for two
miles around was completely
wiped out to the floor save for
ẅ
Western Union—Plus.
“Orion”; Inevitable as the
succession of the seasons is the
trend towards enlarging the
European Western Union de-
fence treaty into a pact for
Atlantic defence. It means that
Canada and U.S.A. will reinforce
the military provisions of the
Western Union—probably to be
extended to cover all the 16
E.R.P. vStates —and so provide
an international force to enable
an Atlantic regional group to
resist aggression.
This sets the course of British
Empire defence planning in the
northern hemisphere. U.K.-
U.S.A. - Canadian partnership
means that while North America
becomes the supporting area for
a front which would include
Britain against any attack from
the east on Western Europe,
Britain and France form a sup-
porting area for a front of
attack coming against Canada
and U.S.A. from the northern
Pacific. Reports from London
of the Empire Prime Ministers’
Conference mention only the
European half of this picture,
but there is clearly a reciprocal
interest.
Conference reports reveal the
rest of the Empire arrangements
in their natural divisions —the
Middle East - Mediterranean
North African region, based
on the new centre in Kenya, and
the Far Easterrt region, covering
the great triangle, Australia-
East Africa-Hong Kong. Inlthis
area the Empire system links
in the Western Pacific with U.S.
strategic dispositions.
In the altered conditions in
which British world-power must
modernly be asserted there
seems no alternative to this over-
all plan. The prime considera-
tion for Australia is the develop-
ment of her arms —and this must
include a respectable military
force —to fulfil her responsibili-
ties under the plan. The Chifley
Government’s “push - button”
concepts, ignoring the need for
a trained military and aerial
field-force, are certainly not
enough.

Ancestors of
an
Industry
Edward Turner, an Englishman, was the
first chemist to determine accurately the atomic
weights of lead, chlorine, silver, barium, mercury
and nitrogen^—all substances of great scientific and
industrial importance. The atomic weight of any
element is the weight of an atom of it compared
with that of one-sixteenth of an atom of oxygen.
Accurate knowledge of atomic weights is inval-
uable. It enables analytical chemists to calculate
the quantities of various elements present in a com-
pound, chemical works’ managers to forecast the
probable yield of a manufacturing process, and
metallurgists to assess the value of an ore. Turner
was born in Jamaica in 1796, but came to Scotland
as a youth to read medicine at the University of
Edinburgh, later proceeding to the Continent to
study chemistry. Returning to Britain, he became
a chemical lecturer at Edinburgh in 1824. Shortly
afterwards he published his “Elements of
Chemistry,” which became one of the standard
chemical text-books of the period. In 1828 he was
appointed Professor of Chemistry at University •
College, London, but held this distinguished ap-
pointment for only a few years, as he in 1837,
just after reaching his fortieth birthday. In the
eyes of his contemporaries, Turner
was pre-eminently a great chemical
teacher, but his more lasting reputa-
tion rests on his meticulous accuracy
as an experimenter.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Next Monday, the experts inform
us, is to be marked by an eclipse of
the sun, in which fact, no doubt,
students of astrology and readers of
omens will discern some pointer to
the rather more important business of
the Melbourne Cup, run on the fol-
lowing day. By way of a form guide
for those who propose to pick ’em by
the stars, it might be mentioned that
Carbon Copy, favorite for the Derby
and strongly fancied for the Cup, is
by Helios (Greek for sun) and traces
back to Eclipse (so, for that matter,
do quite a few other Cup candidates).
On the more practical side of seek-
ing Cup pointers there was Saturday’s
Moonee Valley meeting, and there,
too, the son of Helios was well to
the fore. In fact, Carbon Copy,
Phoibos and Beau Gem, who filled the
places in that order in the w.f.a. W. S.
Cox Plate (10L), are all three by
Helios, and two of them Derby
winners—a wonderful advertisement
for E. A. Underwood’s imported
stallion.
The result of the Plate suggested
that the Derby will be between Car-
bon Copy and Phoibos, but it didn’t
decisively point to either one. Though
Carbon Copy was the winner, there
was only a neck in it, and the race
may well have been won and lost at
the turn, where Beau Gem, swinging
wide, carried Phoibos * with him,
jammed him against Comic Court and
at the same time allowed the pocketed
Carbon Copy to come through on the
rails.
The other outstanding Cup trial on
Saturday was that of Howe very
easily winning the Moonee Valley Gold
Cup. Karachi, as honest as he is big
and plain, finished second, I ? eate^f9^ l
lengths, the outsider Steady just shaded
improving little Fresh Boy for thir
money, and Red Fury was next.
Beaten in the Caulfield Cup by being
taken to the front too far from home,
the New Zealander was ridden much
more patiently by Badger m the
Valley Cup and showed just how
good he is.
Thus the day’s racing, and with it
more Melbourne Cup pointers than
a centipede could shake a leg at;
Howe, Carbon Copy, Phoibos, Fresh
Boy, Red Fury. Favoritism, at the
time of writing, sways between Howe
and Carbon Copy. It must be near
time a favorite won —the last was
Sirius four years back, and the pro-
portion of successful Cup favorites
over the past 50 years works out at
about one in five. It’s also about
time a three-year-old won the Cup;
they always have a wonderful pull
in the weights and the present crop
seem exceptionally good. Carbon
Copy may be the best of them and
at the most will carry 7.10.
The result of the Cup may largely
depend upon the weather between now
and Tuesday. As far as concerns
this page’s Cup fancy, Dark Marne,
the state of the track will be the
consideration. Had Dark Marne won
the Metrop., fqr which he looked a
certainty, he would probably be favor-
ite for the Cup; but heavy going, in
which he is useless, beat him in the
Metrop., as last year it beat him in
the Melbourne Cup, after he had
earlier, on a good surface, beaten the
subsequent Cup winner, Hiraji, in the
Hotham Handicap. Having missed
out on penalties Dark Marne is in
the Cup with 8.11 —a handy weight.
For a thoroughly good track our
selection would be Dark Marne, 1;
Carbon Copy, 2; Howe, 3. A soft
track would bring Howe right into his
element and possibly enable him to
beat Carbon Copy and Fresh Boy.
A really bog-like surface would re-
duce Howe’s chance under 9.5 (inc.
61b. penalty) and enhance the pros-
pects of Red Fury, Carbon Copy and
other lightweights.
The above selections are made in
anticipation of the outcome of the
Derby, and without knowing which
three-year-old may consequently con-
test the Cup. Should Phoibos or any
other of the youngsters prove con-
clusively superior to Carbon Copy in
the Derby, then such a colt will go
very close to taking the Melbourne
Cup.
“Looks like a stymie to me, Bill.”
The most interesting feature of
Saturday’s racing at Rosehill was that
the S.T.C. bad included for the first
time a claiming race —a type of event
which, with variations, is very popu-
lar in England and America. If it
should encourage anybody considering
buying a horse through one of these
races it might b'e mentioned that the
American champion Stymie, winner
of close on a million dollars in stakes,
was thus acquired by his present
owner.
Saturday’s race, in which the maxi-
mum claiming price was set at £2OOO
and the minimum £l5OO (too high for
the class of horses engaged), was run
over seven furlongs and went to Pearl
Trader (N. Watterson), with Rotoiti
and Sun King in the places.
The most noteworthy winners at
Rosehill were Cabaret (B. Smith) and
Foxzami (W. Fellows). Cabaret, who
took the first Parramatta Mixed (7f.),
is a four-year-old mare by Le Grand
Due-Vanity Fair, and has the im-
pressive record of five wins, a second
and three thirds from the nine starts
she has had. She had done her
previous racing in country districts.
Foxzami started at odds-on for the
Auburn Mixed (lOf.), and won by a
mere eight lengths; it is intended
now to rush the Nizami colt to
Melbourne for a crack at the Victoria
Derby.
The class engaged in the main
events at Rosehill was well below
standard. Glencrag (F. Williams) had
a comfortable win in the Flying, and
Fra Diavolo (R. Selkrig) just pipped
Smooth Action in the Rosehill Handi-
cap.

When this page went to press
appeals were about to be heard against
the decision of V.R.C. stewards to
disqualify for two years the horse
Vagabond and connections (owner
Frank Spurway, trainer Dan Lewis
and jockey Darby Munro) for alleged
improper practice concerning the
horse’s performance in the Burwood
Handicap at Caulfield on October 16.
* * * *
In Sydney last week trainer George
Johnson and the horse Newborough
were outed for life and stable attend-
ant Stanley Oakes disqualified for two
years, after stewards had investigated
the analyst’s report on a swab taken
from Newborough after he had
finished third in the Tamarama Han-
dicap at Randwick on October 6.
Appeals have been lodged.
For the second time in a short
space Shannon on Saturday in
America equalled world-record time
in winning a race —the Midstream
horse is surprising even his most
ardent admirers. Saturday’s race was
the Golden Gate Handicap of
£A23,437, and Shannon cut out the 10
furlongs in 1.59|; that time was
originally set in 1939 at Brighton
(Eng.), which is one of the fastest
courses in the world. A week earlier
Shannon had won the Fortyniner
Handicap at Golden Gate (Calif.),
clocking 1.47| for nine furlongs.
Golf followers, eager to see whether
Ferrier or Pickworth would preyail in
the Australian Open, had the suspense
well and truly prolonged. To win
Ferrier needed a birdie three at the
final hole, but shot a par four to tie
and gain a play-off.

Viewed at Sydney New Palace
Theatre, “The Glory of Sport” is a
film to fascinate anyone interested in
sport, and, for that matter, most
other folk. Beautifully photographed
in technicolor, it’s a magnificently
produced coverage of the Olympic
Games and runs well over two hours.
Disappointing from the viewpoint of
Australian audiences is the omission
of Merv Woods’s sculling victory and
our swimming successes, but there’s
plenty in it to atone for that.

On returning from the Olympic
Games one of the best of American
sporting scribes, Red Smith, in N. Y.
“Herald Tribune,” tossed a fair bou-
quet to British sportsmanship ;
“The Games were well run, and
were attended by the largest and fair-
est and most valorous and most gener-
ously sportsmanlike crowds assembled
since the first discus-thrower of ancient
Greece skulled his bride with a
dinner-plate.”

Joe Louis isn’t the only member qf
his family who can earn a dollar in
pretty smart time. Reported from
America that Joe’s mother, Mrs.
Barrow Brooks, recently collected a
jackpot of 12,000 dollars in a radio
quiz session. Other reports, inci-
dentally, suggest that Joe may change
his mind about retiring; if he does it
will be a mighty shame.

In a return bout with Mickey
Tollis at Sydney Stadium,
Tommy Burns (10.6 D put his Aus-
tralian Welter title on the line and re-
tained it with a close points decision
after a really good fight. The fickle
mob, always eager to see a champion
beaten, hooted the decision until
Burns grabbed a microphone and,
with a few well-chosen words, put the
malcontents neatly in their place;
whatever effect it may have had on
his boxing, film work has taught
Burns something in other directicyis.
One conclusion to be drawn from the
scrap was that either Burns has lost
his punch or else Tollis is solid
granite from the neck up. Burns con-
tinually landed them flush on the chin,'
but Tollis always came back.

ABORIGINALITIES
■ “Maluka”; Smiler was one of those
unhappy misfits who go through life
for ever doing things wrong. Sacked from
job after job, he eventually cast up on
old Bull Martin’s property, and there,
still making a hash of every task he did,
he stayed. The neighbors wondered, and
one day at the pub Tom Ryan asked
why. “See here. Bull,” he said. “It’s got
us beat. You’ve had Smiler with you
for years now, and we all know he’s
useless.” “You’re, wrong,” replied Bull.
“No matter how useless any man may
seem there’s always one thing he can do
wgll.” “Mebbe,” conceded Ryan. “But
I’m blest if I know what Smibr’s good
for.” “Well, now,” said Bull mildly.
“No more do I. But,” he added with
sudden determination, “if it takes me a
lifetime I’ll keep him till I find out.”

“Mat’s Mate”: We’d been out in the
scrub for six months, our cheque was like
a blanket, our hair was falling into our
tea, we’d had five arguments and one
fight in six weeks, Mat was swearing at
the rabbits for making so much noise, and
I was undecided whether to cut his throat
while he slept or put'S.A.P. in his tea —so
we concluded it was time we hit the flesh-
pots of some town for a change. Upon
Mathoura fell the weight of our first
week’s iniquity, and the trooper strongly
urged us to seek more salubrious spots,
wherefore we rolled into Moama in a
mellow dusk and headed for the Border
Inn. Peacefully we absorbed several
beers, and were about to absorb several
more when there was a flurry and into
the pub surged a flock of girls—a hockey
team and their supporters up from
Bendigo. They fluttered into the bar, most
of them ordering lemonade, a few calling
for “weak shandies.” Mat drained his
pot, rose, up and with a terrible look on
his face roared, “Wherinell’s the man
that owns this pub?” The publican came
anxiously along the bar. A momentary
silence ruled. “Mate,” said. Mat to the
Bung, “I often heard about people
prostitootin’ their talents, but you’re the
first publican I ever struck runnin’ a
wimmen’s boardin’-house.” And with a
bitter look he picked up the nearest
lemonade, downed it, ejaculated “Pah!”
and stalked out. A pub on the Shep-
parton-road that hadn’t a girl within two
miles of it restored his sanity by morning.

“Him”: Sydneysiders have lately been
startled by the sudden appearance in most
unexpected places of an exceedingly
chummy sea-lion. The old gentleman
seems to have a quaint sense of humor,
and his latest effort —popping his head
suddenly out of the surf in front of a
rather bewildered bather —gave me a
laugh that I badly needed. The
idea of unexpectedly coming face to face
with anything so comical as a sea-lion’s
physog. has, in my opinion, a point or
two of humor. It takes me back to Mur-
willumbah (N.S.W.)—about 10 years ago.
On the second floor of an office building
in Commercial-road a young typiste,
looking up from her keys for a
moment, found herself staring into
the solemn eyes of a large and be-
wildered Jersey cow. A few minutes
before Strawb., with others of her clan,
was being driven over the Tweed River
bridge. Taking sudden fright at the
traffic, she had dashed blindly across
the road, over the footpath and up the
first flight of staifs in the building. Hav-
ing got so far it was a simple matter
for her to stroll through the first door
she came to and rest her puzzled head
over the office counter. Incidentally,
there were 20 stairs in that flight, and
the herculean task of getting her down
again is still talked about by those who
had to do the job. Some maintained it
would have been simpler to sign her on
as one of the staff and let her loose with
the 5.30 rush.

“Übet”: The town transport stopped
at the woolshed, and George, dropping in
with a small bundle of woolbales, found
Dad Simpkins cleaning the shed. “Get-
ting ready f’r shearing, are you?” he
remarked, dropping the bundle. “Yair.
Nothin’ like havin’ everything fixed
ready.” Dad eyed the woolbales. “Better
not put ’em there, George,” he instructed.
“That’s where the water-buckets go.”
George glanced at the row of ancient
kero.-tins. “What, across the middle of
the floor?” “Well, where else would a
man put ’em? That’s the place the roof
leaks. Shift the bales over? Gripes,
no, not there. That’s me pieces-bin agen
that wall.” “Where? No bin here.”
George looked all round vaguely.
“ ’Course there is,” Dad persisted. “Them
yard-rails is one side of it, an’ when I
get a coupler bales pressed and stood up
they’ll make the other. Then I chuck the
pieces in between.” The carrier grabbed
the bundle. “Awright, I’ll put them here
in this little three-sided place.” “Aw, cut
it out, George, the sheep’ll walk on it,”
came the old bloke’s protest. “That’s the
catchin’-pen.” “This? But the sheep’ll
walk out.” “Not with old Musty and
Nigger chained in front they won’t,”
Dad explained patiently. “Gripes, a
bloke’s got t’ make use of everythin’ these
days if ’e wants a few conveniences round
the place.”

“RJE.”: As a variation of “Where do
flies go in winter?”, where do seagulls go

gregate on our beaches, how often do
you see one dead except, of course,
those that come to an untimely end from
“I tell you I wasn't doing more than twenty."
boys’ shanghais and senseless “sports”
armed with rifles? A further observation:
An amazing number of gulls possess only
one leg.' Notice them dozing and it
appears that they have the trait, common
to the bird family, of retracting a section
of their undercarriage. But more often
than not the other member is missing, or
only partially complete. Probably they
‘become so maimed by fish when diving
for food.

“Lower Tops’l”: The old horse seems
to be a thing of the past in Gippsland.
Along the 120 miles of Prince’s Highway
between Dandenong and Sale the other
day we counted only 13 —two in baker’s
carts —and you can see a mile each side
of the road. A similar distance on to
Orbost there were 22, but proof of the
noddy’s disappearance from the bush
scene comes from Mallacoota, where an
upholsterer in a horse-caravan negotiated
the 15 miles of turn-off road beside the
inlet down from Genoa. Everywhere the
docile cattle on the flats came running
and some broke through fences and
chased him. These days there isn’t a
horse-and-cart in Mallacoota.

“A.L.A.” (Fiji): It’s all in the point
of view, “Dusty Mile” (B. 25/8/’4B). I
know of a coffin which was kept at the
back of a store in Fiji for years because
the man for whom it was made recovered
unexpectedly from his “last” illness. But
the outstanding incident of a prepared
coffin in my memory took place at Kun-
ming, China. A sick old man, groaning
feebly, was carried out from an inn as
I was passing and deposited on the
pavement just as the carpenters—or his
relations —dumped his coffin beside him.
My feelings were indescribable, but I was
told at the time—and as the years passed
I understood only too well —that in a
land where dogs and vultures were
hungry the knowledge that a coffin was
prepared brought comfort to the dying. |

“L.P.”: There was no doubt that the
old swaggie with a battered fiddle-case
strapped bn the back of his push-bike
was a musician. Everyone said so. The
fact that he never talked music or gave a
tune when requested only enhanced his
standing—few topnotchers talk about
themselves, and fewer still waste their
time playing the classics to addicts of
jazz. And there were some folk in our
little town who knew the background of
the fiddler. They knew his real name
(ending with “isky”) and that he had
been a celebrity until booze and women
beat him. It had even been stated that
he carried a priceless Strad in that bat-
tered old case. Then one day I came on
the fiddler’s camp unexpectedly. He was
boiling his billy, and, as I approached un-
noticed, he opened the case and took from
it a small calico bag of tea, another of
sugar, a fork, knife and spoon and other
unmusical odds and ends.

“Dinkum”; Ben, the new rouseabout,
was a thin, fair youth on his first trip to
the country, and Jonesy’s brood of seven
bush-bred Australians eyed him with joy-
ful speculation. But Ben was very ready
to talk of the sea and boast of his surfing
prowess, and, since the kids had never
seen the sea, their admiration and curio-
sity saved him from many a prank.
Then the rains came and. the creek
through the property rose to a dark-
brown muddy stream. One of the younger
Joneses rushed in and announced between
much puffing and blowing, “Two sheep
are marooned on a sandbar in the crick
an’ the water’s rising.” Ben took over.
He flung out orders to the kids. “Bring
that coil of rope. You there, get
another from the cowyard.” They beat
it for the creek, and, sure enough a the two
sheep were huddled fearfully on a small
diminishing sandbar surrounded by the
rushing torrent. Ben tied the end of one
rope round his torso and the other end
around a sturdy oak. One end of the
second coil was also hitched around the
oak, the free being carried to tie around
the sheep as a hauling line. Ben thumped
his lustily, took a running dive —
and skidded on his chest over the stones
in about ten inches of water. A bruised,
baleful rouseabout it was who gingerly
arose and waded on to rescue the two
sheep who still fearfully stuck to their
sandbar.

“Muskeen”: About the jabiru (B.
6/10/’4B). To the extent that he is ex-
ceedingly shy and wary he has the dis-
position of an old boundary-rider, but
there the resemblance ends. Like the
native companion, he is amenable to
domesticity, and many years ago there
was a tame one at Mainoru station (N.T.).
He was a gentle; good-tempered and
good-mannered bird, unlike captive
brolgas, which are of uncertain temper
and likely to take offence and wreak
vengeance on the flimsiest pretexts. All
jabirus are not old bachelors, either, but
their eggs are not deposited in depressions
on the plain as are those of the native
companion. The jabiru builds a huge stick
nest in a tree which is generally in the
middle of a swamp ; the nest is lined with
grass and is about 12ft. in circumference
with a considerable cavity. The eggs are
coarse-shelled and dull white in color.
Incidentally, the jabiru, which is Aus-
tralia’s only stork, is not “black-and-
white.” The “black” plumage is actually
a brilliant, metallic dark green.
“B. 4”: I’ve seen only two nests of the
magnificent jabiru (B. 6/10/’4B) in my
Queensland rambles, and those on coastal
swamps. In each case the avian murlie
was built on the remnant of a huge
swamp-gum, showing sturdy storm-
snapped limbs upthrust through an im-
mense tangle of sticks that would fill a
dray. The sight of a pair of piebald
giants standing on the verandah of their
castle and unloading cargo from their
fish-stabbers into their clamorous nippers
was worth waiting for. In the Gulf
country I’ve watched a pair lob on red
legs near a drying hole stocked with
silver-perch and jack-knife the mob in
a few rounds. Why dumbnuts shoot
these chaps is beyond me.

“M 8”: So “Hannans St.” doubts
whether 50 gallons of petrol in the
open would have been enough to
cremate the remains of Hitler and his
lady-love (B. 13/10/’4B). It’s all a matter
of procedure. Your amateur cremationist
simply pours the stuff over the body and
chucks a lighted match at it, repeating
the performance until either the job is
done or the petrol supply cuts out. The
correct method is lay the body in a trough
or a pit dug in hard ground, pour in just
enough petrol to cover it, then apply the
light. Assuming that you have sense
enough not to try it on wet or windy days,
50 gallons would be ample. My most
successful job was done on my second
wife with 32 ; all that was left was the
deceased’s wristlet-watch, nine cigarettes
and 17s. 5d., which I had taken the pre-
caution to remove after concussing her
with an axe,

“Old-timer”: Sam the Silent fed and
drank well through the Riverina in the
old days, scarcely uttering a word as he
passed through great towns or
halted temporarily at sheep-station home-
stead or fisherman’s camp. A storekeeper
in, say, Hay would find on the counter
an empty nosebag bearing a printed
legend; “Owner out of tucker and gon
to rest and gather strenth. Pleas fill.”
Sometimes it worked, sometimes not, but
as Sam confessed in one of his rare
speeches, “Y* get a lotta knockbacks, but
y’ get a lotta tucker.” Similarly, Riverina
publicans were apt to discover an empty
black billy on the bar, the usual invita-
tion in these instances being: “Bad
drowth.” At homesteads the nosebag
would be discovered tied to the handle
of the kitchen door or hung from a
verandah-post. Many of those invited
to contribute to Sam’s upkeep tried
to catch him as he retrieved bag or billy;
they seldom did, a fact which in some
places aroused grave doubts as to whether
he was a material form or not. In the end
misplaced humor wrecked a payable
scheme. Sam sneaked away with many a
bag of bricks and billy of cold tea before
a mob of station-hands tied up three
snakes in his bag at Gol Gol pub. The
silent one hit that pub about 11 p.m. like
a cyclone, and they had to send 20-odd
miles to Wentworth for the mounted
trooper before Sam cleared out. The last
time I saw him was in Echuca. He’d
acquired a wife and three kids and was
more silent than ever.

“Taswegian”: Peering down the
umpteenth hollow stump for the day we
saw a peculiar face. The white-rimmed
mouth was wide open, showing pink in-
side ; the eyes were round, dark and
staring; the top point of the beak was
very sharp and turned over; white
whiskers stuck out at eyebrow position
and around the mouth; and the whole
greyish-white face had something of the
look of a monkey. While I was staring at
it the bird rose up fiercely in the hollow,
and, when I hastily withdrew, sank down
again. We were both bending over for a
second inspection when she suddenly shot
out of the hole at high speed, just missing
our faces, and disappeared into the bush.
Left in the hole were two smaller birds.
They had the same habit of opening
their mouths, probably for a greedier
reason. Sometimes they’d shut their eyes,
and then open one, and sometimes they'd
heave with what appeared to be a belch.
After we had studied our bird-books we
picked them for owlet night-jars,
nocturnal moth- and insect-eaters. But
what puzzled us was how a bird Bjin.

shoot out at such a speed from a roughly

“J.D.P.”; The reason “G.S.” missed the
start of the galloping go.’s ascent up the
jarrah sapling (B. 29/9/’4B) was because
the lizard whizzed skyward on the side
opposite to its pursuer. The wily one
circles the trunk- to avoid detection as
it scrambles aloft. Altitude acquired, our
Queensland monitor flattens down, sinks
his hooks in and stays put. I’ve never
seen one simulate a branch for protec-
tion. The go., while daintily stepping

legs and tail while it takes a quick peek
before scattering portions of the land-

OPALS.
Their fire is found in the sunset;
Their pearl is part of the dawn;
Their faint green-blue is the nameless hue
That follows the dark withdrawn.
No light from the diamond-cluster,
No glow in the ruby’s heart
Is a match for the rainbow lustre
These magical stones impart.
The pink of the sandal blossom,
The white of the coolibah stems,
And the grey galah’s red bosom
Find place in these bushland gems.
They hold in my heart for ever
White Cliffs and Lightning Ridge,
And the bends of the Darling River
From Bourke to Murray Bridge.
They sing of the scented sandhills
And the sunlit plains out west;
But my true love wears my opals
And that’s why I love them best.
SCOTLAND.

“Telarb”; Karakasoma, my Western
Islands cobber, was skiting about the time
he did “them Yanks over” during the
war. He was approached on T.I. by a
couple of Uncle Sam’s boys, who, hearing
that Karak was a diver, were very keen
to buy a pearl. He kept putting them
off until, finally, with a great show of
secrecy, he agreed to meet them the
following night with the doings. He
spent all next day working on the heel of
a large mother-o’-pearl shell. After chop-
ping out a cube he used a grindstone,
emery-paper and acid to turn out a sphere
of surpassing brilliance. It would have
taken an expert to detect the fake, and
the two Americans paid over £5O and
went away happy. “Just a little bit lie.

to discussing prospects for the day’s

“Frank Humphrey”: The prospector
had been lost somewhere between the
rugged, scrub-clad ranges running north
to Cape York and the vast featureless
expanses of turkey bush that separate
the better country of the Peninsula.
“He’d just about had it when the trackers
found him,” I told old Biff. “Starving,
lost his horses and packs ; too weak to
toe an old sand goanna he saw.” Bill
showed little sympathy. “These nineteen-
forty-eight prospectors!” he sneered. “If

their horses aren’t standing in the kitchen
they dunno where they are. It’s got me
screwed how any man ever got lost in
this country. It’s impossible. You’ve
got the sea each side of you and the
telegraph-line up the middle. Every
black swamp has magnetic antbeds point-
ing out north and south. The leaning
top of each indicates the west. The
quinine-tree sheds its bark on the west
side. If you cut short of tucker you can
do it on yams and sugarbag.” Bill
shook his head. “It’s got me whacked.
They should never leave the bitumen.”

“Horseless Horseman”: I’ve discovered
one part of Australia where the spread of
civilisation hasn’t interfered with the lyre-
bird. It’s the thousand or so square miles
of unblazed mountain-forest between the
seaboard running from Cape Everard and
Gabo and Prince’s Highway in East
Gippsland. In there the other sunrise,
making my way from Wingan Inlet to
“Big” Rame Head, I saw nine of the
glorious birds scratching among the
rotting corduroy along a two-mile stretch
of track, and, at the head of the inlet, the
calls of menura resounding through the
sub-tropical bush to the accompaniment
of the cracks of coachwhip-birds are
something beyond description. On all
the 23-mile hike into “The Wingan” along
the ridge track from Mt. Drummer on
the highway one sees these birds, and
their grubbing. My contention is that,
as rabbits are a rarity in that forest —
there is little real grass—and dingoes
abound, there are no foxes. And as for
Homo sapiens— well, except for the occa-
sional visits of an oysterman to Wingan,
the country is as little visited now as it
was in the days when the blacks were
bad.

“Kilkennicat”: “Lofty” has one foot
on the track (B. 22/9/’4B) with his ex-
planation of breaking a tumbler and 100
windows by vibration. It is a safe bet
that all the windows were of the same
size. The note given out by a tumbler
when tapped varies according to the size
and thickness. But if the exact note from
a particular glass is taken by either
vocalist or violinist, and maintained, the
glass will respond to the vibration, gain-
ing in volume until the increased vibration
finally breaks it. A similar vibra-
tion cost a man his life at a fire in
George-street, Sydney (opposite Queen
Victoria Markets), some years ago. He
was the top man of three on a 90ft. ex-
tension-ladder, playing a hose through an
opening when the stream struck the wall.
The back-pressure of the water started
the ladder swaying. As the water struck
wall and opening alternately, coinciding
with the vibration-frequency of the ladder,
the sway increased until breaking-point
was reached and the ladder snapped like
a toy. Had it been many times stronger
it would still have broken, provided that
the impulse was maintained a little
longer.

“Biggest Mac”: Anyone who has ever
owned a pet mong will claim it had some-
thing over the border collie. Snow White,
at working sheep, or was at least as
clever; but all will share sorrow at the
death of the champion. Snow White re-
ceived its first training when Chief Traffic-
inspector Walsh, then a mounted con-
stable, was stamping out sheep-stealing in
the Tatiara (S.A.) district. Another of
his dogs was awarded the R.S.P.C.A.’s
Sagacious medal for similar efforts.
Since then Snow White has won more
than 30 sheepdog trials in Victoria and
South Australia. Five times it obtained
the possible 100 points, and retired un-
defeated last year after having won three
State sheepdog-trial championships. The
owner intends to have the head and skin
mounted.

“Horseless Horseman”: All my life I’ve
been cursed by rabbits. As a boy I
had to help dog and dig them out, and
in the back-country—well, on netted-off
tanks on the West Darling I’ve trapped
as many as 22,000 in a night. Now,
believe it or not, I reside with a pet
cottontail. Yes, you’re right—it’s the
missus. Our tyke brought him home as
a fortnight-old kitten, and, instead of his
neck being stretched, the “poor darling”
was revived with brandy fed through an
eye-dropper. Now the three-months-old
Harley—bless him —
has porridge for
breakfast, granose
and milk for lunch
and the town kids
make him special
custards and things.
In his cage he sleeps
under a silk cushion,
and I had to put my
foot down when he
was brought inside
before the fire,
although you’ve never
seen a rabbit do
parlor tricks like our
Harley—everything from kicking up his
hind-legs on the hop to washing his St.
Vitus-dance nose like a cat. Then the
other day he escaped. I chased him for
an hour in my best Sunday clothes
through a neighbor’s beans and cabbages
before I got him back home. Now I
can’t make up my mind if I’m glad or
sorry!
“Moyhu”: Animal cries (B. 13/ 10/’4S)
call to mind the varied bellowings of
the herd Ferdinand. When the big fellow
smells blood and, raising his head, lets
go with that high-pitched, breathless
bellow (made, apparently, by sucking and
not blowing), cows, calves and every
herd-member except the neuters scamper
hotfoot to the scene, udders swinging,
heads outthrust and tails on high. Even
“Why don't you inhale it?”
10-year-old Strawb. on such occasions
can raise a canter. Surrounded by the
herd, each with its nose investigating the
specimen, the old bull commences to
graze peacefully as if nothing had hap-
pened. The bellow emitted by a bull
when challenging a neighboring herd-
king is no less noisy, yet strangely the
ear-splitting threats are completely dis-
regarded by the females. It’s not so,
however, with the rumbles that come with
the mating season, though on these occa-
sions one cow only seems to hear the
call as she demurely detaches herself
from her mates.

by means of a bridle-rope and line. Every
day or so he hauls up these contraptions,
and with a bent tyre-lever rakes out the
eels which are asleep in the folds. The
biggest slitherer he gbt was 6ft. long.

Gerrard ; That homing pigeon which
returned after six years (B. 13/10/48)
had nothing on an American bird. After
nine years one of S. Wellmans
pigeons returned to Cleveland, Ohio, in
May last, from the 100-mile race it started
back in 1939. Well-fed, the check-colored
bird landed on the loft and promptly
slipped inside to take its accustomed
perch. Wellman said the pigeon started
the race 100 miles from Cleveland, but
he was unable to remember the exact
point. Not many birds come back after
nine years, he commented. But they
do have remarkable memories. This one
has either been lost or penned up. ’

“Chuck”: Dick wasn’t used to trapping,
and, coming back from setting his first
line, he began trying to check his traps,
“First one’s near the corner-post,” he
muttered. “Second at the black log,
third on the white burrow, fourth—er—
fourth. Cripes, where’s me fourth?” He
puzzled awhile, let it go, and went on.
“Then I set a couple in the first gully,
an’ —no, that was the second gully. Well,
where” He closed his eyes and
wrestled with his memory. “Cripes, Bill,”
he said presently. “I’ve lorst half me
traps. What’ll I do?” Twenty minutes
later he was still worrying. “Qne at the
black stump,” he mumbled, “an’ one—
er” “Pour y’self a drink an’ shut
up,” Bill advised. “Here’s Ted and Sandy
f’r a game o’ cards,” As the game pro-
ceeded, Dick forgot his troubles in his
usual disagreement with Ted. The argu-
ment was more serious this time, and
Dick was still replaying the hand in ques-
tion when he woke at daylight. “If he’d
led his flamin’ queen,” he persisted, mak-
ing off for his trapline, “we’d ’a’ won.”
Three hours later Bill came on him skin-
ning his catch. “If he’d led his queen”——
“Aw, shut up, can’t y’?” Bill snapped,
“Decent catch. Have any trouble finding
y’r traps?” “Finding ’em? No; why?
Aw, cripes, yair, I clean f’got they wus
lorst. Didn’t matter anyway ; I went

is preceded by a slametan, or feast, as is
every domestic occurrence, the afterbirth
is deposited in the hole and the tree’s

or crow’s-foot elm, is one of the com-
monest of these scrub-woods, and has a
wide variety of uses. Known in different
areas as ironwood, hickory, stavewood,
brown oak and ash meganti, silky elm
is easily recognised in the scrubs by its
pronounced buttressing roots, which form
wide plank-flanges for several feet above
the ground. Some of the trees in Queens-
land’s far north have enormous flanges,
and their timber is a deeper reddish shade
than the S.Q. type. The wood steam-
bends well, is hard, extremely tough and
springy. Prone to rot in damp situations
and in the ground, it is a pretty and de-
corative wood for flooring, polishing and
staining well. With Queensland black
walnut, tulip oak has a tremendous re-
sistance to the passage of electric currents,
specially treated pieces offering safe re-
sistance to voltages of up to 100,000 for
a minute without any trace of leakage or
fault.
JIM OF THE OUTBACK.
Where he is I do not know,
It’s far away and long ago;
Where the long dry stages are,
And the soaks are few and far.
Jim, where are you roving
In the far outback;
Jim, where are you droving
Along the silent track?
Somewhere where men know cattle
Far from shack and shed;
Somewhere where men must battle
When the sun burns red!
Years ago, Jim wrote to me
That I’d laugh if I could see
His camels four with heaving packs,
His aide-de-camps—five thieving blacks
With skinny dogs and skinny gins.
“We start,” he said, “when dawn begins,
Camels and dogs and black young Mary,
Who is my private secretary.”
Brown was his forehead and wrinkled,
Bald as an emu egg;
Dry was his skin and crinkled,
Long and thin was his leg,
And somewhere out in the hazes,
That independent coot
Has sent the world to blazes,
Settled and taken root.
Or past the Never Never,
Out where the sandhills glare,
Old Jim goes roving ever
Somewhere—and God knows where!
Where he is I do not know,
For his address must vary:
Jim, who had long years ago
His private secretary.

You can ease the Strain
in 30 Seconds!
The Ephazone treatment brings swift relief from those
gasping, choking attacks familiar to the Asthma
sufferer. One small Ephazone tablet goes right to
the root of the trouble. As soon as it reaches the
stomach healing agents are released to dissolve the
germ-laden accumulations which clog the bronchial
tubes.
Don’t allow those Asthma attacks to develop.
Ephazone builds up resistance to future spasms
besides bringing almost instant relief in cases of
sudden attack.
Ephazone is equally invaluable in cases o 4

Aphis Disease.
“J.R.D.”; Throughout the
Commonwealth when seasonal
conditions are favorable sheep,
are affected by a disease vari-
ously named aphis disease,
swelled-head or scab, and is
often confused with scabby-
mouth. Actually it is akin to
sunburn, and only affects cer-
tain types of sheep and other
animals in much the same way
as certain fair-skinned persons
am affected by the rays of the
sun. The disease is not due to
the sun alone, the chief factor
responsible being fresh green
feed. It is usually aggravated
by lack of shade and is most
common on open plains or
downs country.
Earliest symptoms are swel-
ling of exposed parts, usually
heads, ears and backs of newly-
shorn sheep. These swellings
cause much irritation and pain
and presently exude a yellowish
liquid, which eventually forms
scabs. In this condition further
complications and serious loss
may result from fly-strike or
blood-poisoning. The scabs may
block the nostrils and cause
suffocation. Shearers object to
handling sheep in this condition
An outbreak may be expected
when a warm spring, following
rain, brings on a quick growth
of green herbage. The green
coloring undergoes a chemical
change during the process of
digestion, and where the liver is
unable to cope with the load
thrust upon it a type of jaundice
may result or the symptoms
described above may appear,
Photo-sensitisation is the correct
designation of the disease.
It affects only sheep with
white skins, certain crosses of
British breeds being mostly
affected. White cattle or those
with white /patches of skin,
horses with a white blaze or
white legs are also affected, and
large areas of skin may slough
off. The udders and escutcheons
of cows may be attacked and
lead to mastitis. Color of the
hair is not important; it de-
pends on the skin underneath.
In north-west N.S.W. clouds
of aphis are often present when
the disease is at its height, and
many blame the aphis for the
disease. This is wrong; aphis
are purely vegetarians. Proven-
tion should be aimed at rather
than treatment. Exposed white
parts of susceptible animals
should be treated with some-
thing that will darken the skin,
Cattle and horses may be pro-
tected by dyeing them with a
strong solution of Condy’s crys-
tals or washing-blue. Sheep
should be treated with a dark
pignient that will not stain the
wool permanently. Lamp-black

Wheat Storage.
“He-Ne”: The N.S.W. Gov-
eminent at last is aware of the
inadequate space in country
silos for wheat in seasons when
big crops and transport troubles
make it necessary to hold the
wheat outback. There is, too,
the growing shortage of jute for
bags, and the N.S.W. decision to
augment silo space is wise,
though the extra space won’t be
ready for the coming crop,
More bins are to be built at
Brushwood, Gilgandra, Hoi-
brook, Marinna, Narromine,
Peak Hill and Tootool. N.S.W.
country silos hold only
24,000,000 bushels ; last year the
harvest (some of which is still
in country stacks) was
100,000,000 bushels, A normal
harvest is 50 million or better,
That part of the harvest that
cannot be accommodated in the
silos has to be bagged, and the
bags all come from India. Be-
fore the war the world’s jute re-
quirements were 10,000,000
bales of 300 cornsacks each.
This India had no difficulty in
supplying, but now it is a very
different picture. Before the
war India imported a large part
of her food supply from
Burma, Siam and Java, but these
markets have contracted seri-
ously and India is left largely to
her own resources. Land that
used to be planted to jute now
has to carry rice.
Pre-war jute production of
10,000,000 bales annually
shrank last year to 8,500,000
bales, and this year the figure
has gone down still further to
7,505,000 bales. Thus there is a
25 p.c, fall in production while
the demand for jute remains con-
stant. In addition to more silo
space, investigations should be
set in hand to find a substitute
bag of some other material. The
concrete - manufacturers years
ago changed to a coarse paper-
bag; maybe something similar
could be found for wheat.
Shortage of sacks for the
coming harvest is beginning to
cause anxiety, as only 31,000
bales are at present in N.S.W.,
and wheat-stripping will begin
in the north-west shortly. If the
harvest is as good as some ex-
perts assert the bag position will
be desperate.
The Unprofitable Cow.
“Mr.”: Often she’s a good-
looking animal with a nicely-
shaped udder and produces what
appears to be profitable milk.
But unless she’s tested her effect
as a depressant on the herd’s
average butterfat yield cannot
be known. It is what she puts
into the milk more than the
quantity that makes a cow
“Run away! It's Daves turn to milk you this morning."
worth keeping. With costs high
and labor scarce and expensive,
a cow on her second or third
calf that does not produce more
than 2001 b. of butterfat isn’t
worth keeping.
Average butterfat production
for all cows, tested and untested,
in Victoria, is 2001 b. As the
average for purebreds in the
standard test is 3401 b. and for
grade-test cows 2401 b,, there
must be a large number of un-
tested cows in Victoria produc-
ing well below the 2001 b. mark ;
animals that would be eliminated
if the herd were under test. The
profitable cow costs no more
toi feed and milk than the
waster. One way to raise the
herd average is to use a pure-
bred bull of known production ;
in the meantime locate the un-
profitable cow by having her
milk tested, eliminate her and
put a young heifer bred from
high-producing parents in her
place.
A Farm Orchard.
“Pat O’Day”: Young Digger
farmers starting off on a settle-
ment block in inland districts
will find that an orchard pays.
When soil is old, that is, it has
been well worked, there is not
the same amount of labor in
preparation for the planting pro-
gramme. Advice from older
neighbors, who have studied the
contour of the land, as well as
knowing the climate well, should
be sought.
A slope at side or back of
house, preferably with an
easterly aspect and adjacent to
water (so that taps may be put
into the orchard later when
funds allow), is worth consider-
ing. Stiff, hard-to-work ground,
such as some red loams with
portions of clay, liable to water-
logging, need trenching and the
clay broken up and left in the
trench for drainage. Even hill-
side orchards need thorough
drainage.
Tree - planting begins with
careful handling of the young
trees immediately they are re-
ceived from the nursery. Put
the containers or parcel in water
for at least half an hour prior to
planting. The trees are usually
planted 30ft. apart. The holes
should be dug to a depth of 2ft.
and be of a good width to allow
the tree-roots to spread. Manure
should not be used for young
trees in their early stage of
growth, as they advance too
quickly.
Plant in spring, though citrus
can be planted at any time.
Almond-trees are useful orna-
mentals that make good wind-
breaks. It is best to confine the
various trees, such as peaches,
plums, pears, cherries, etc., to
well-known varieties and reserve
a separate few rows for experi-
ment in the not-known-so-well
types. Besides the importance
of pruning when trees are estab-
lished, deciduous trees need to
be sprayed in winter for control
or prevention of various pests.
Crating Fowls.
“Urana”; Here are some
hints on the procedure:
Consign to a reliable dealer.
Don’t be misled by advertise-
ments offering higher prices.
You might get much less in the
long run through cheating in the
weighing or the tale of “fowls
found dead.” Let the dealer
know when you are sending the
poultry so that there will be no
chance of his not collecting them
on arrival. Give the railways
plenty of notice when ordering
the crates. It sometimes takes a
week or more for your station-
master to obtain one. Hose out
the crate before putting the
fowls in it. Dirty crates are a
good place for diseases to har-
bor.
Wire one or two tins in the
corners of the crates. Fill these
with water as late as possible,
preferably after the crate has
been loaded on to the train. This
is particularly important in the
summer if the fowls have a long
trip to make. My consignee
told me that it is not rare to
find whole crates full of dead
birds after a hot day’s travel-
ling.
Do not overcrowd the crates.
It is better to have 16 fowls
arrive in good condition than
risk squeezing in 24. If the
fowls are to leave in the morn-
ing, catch them the night before,
preferably when they are roost-
ing. Chasing them around in
the sun overheats them and
gives them a bad start on their
trip. Put plenty of wheat or
corn in the crate so that they
can have a good feed when they
wake in the morning. Add some
more before they are taken to
the railway for them to eat on
the way.
The Lemon-tree.
“Myrrhee”: Regular pruning
isn’t necessary, but it will some-
times benefit by an occasional
barbering to remove the thick
growth from the centre. This
allows the sun through, result-
ing in a renewal of fresh fruit-
ing wood on long-dormant
branches. A vigorously-growing
young lemon-tree needs to be
watched, as it has a tendency to
produce strongly-growing
vertical shoots which will result
in a badly-shaped tree, and a
reduction in the more fruitful
horizontal shoots. Remove these
vertical shoots at the point of
origin.
Downs Wheal Soils.
“Ned”: Queensland Depart-
ment of Agriculture is to under-
take a survey of them to ascer-
tain the most suitable types in
the various localities. For some
time millers have been up
against the problem of mottling
of grain, which was thought to
be due to lack of nitrogen in the
soils and which lowered the
gluten content. Previous tests
had established that where yield
per acre increased gluten con-
tent decreased. Effort is now
being made to find a high-yield-
ing wheat for milling which will

But the saying is used only to inspire the adop-

At Ronaldson-Tippett the highest principles and

Plough the land in early win-
ter and leave till spring, when
the seed should be sown in drills
about 3ft. 6in. apart. Plants
should be 18in. apart. Four to
five pounds of seed are needed
to sow an acre. Hill the plants
when they’re a foot or so high,
The heads should be cut off
when the seed is hardened but
not too ripe and placed on racks.

Use an oil-can or eye-dropper

for pig- and calf-pen floors; it
is as warm as wood, as clean and
as strong as concrete. Lay a
concrete base enclosed by walls
2in. high. When dry, paint with
boiling tar and sprinkle with
sawdust. Then add the sawdust-

clean sawdust, free from wood
chunks. Finally, plaster with
neat cement,
“Bill C”: Don’t neglect eye
blight in cattle, which usually
appears during a dry, dusty
spell, and can have a very
adverse effect on stock short of
green grass. Isolate all cases to
prevent the disease from spread-
ing, and treat the inflamed eyes
with sulphanilamide ointment,
Five per cent, of sulphanilamide

cement for repairing iron cook-
ing-vessels is made by mixing
equal quantities of red-lead and
litharge with glycerine until a
substance very similar t o
glazier’s putty is obtained. This
cement is both waterproof and
fireproof and will serve for
mending cracks in steam pipes.

the boll of the linseed, entering
the stalk at near the bottom and
eating upwards. Earlier-planted
crops have been largely immune
from infestation, but later-sown
have been vigorously attacked,
Using a D.D.T. dust, several
growers whose crops were
attacked utilised aircraft to dust
crops, and later inspection
showed a 100 per cent, kill, the
pests succumbing within 20
minutes of the dusting. Cater-
pillars have got into some linseed
crops and have attacked barley
in the Cambooya district,
Some growers of barley are now

MR.
RICHARD
THORNTON
I
A respected Member of Lloyd’s for many
years during the middle of the nineteenth
century, he electrified the city with his
daring Insurance risks. Mr. Thornton was
also described as a born adventurer, a reck-
less gambler and a fearless seaman. One
of his outstanding exploits was to take his
own ship into the Baltic in the teeth of the
enemy for a cargo of hemp to dispose of on
the London market.
ic This little thumb-nail sketch, which we
hope will be of interest to you, is one of a
series of personalities who were prominent
in the early days of historic Lloyd’s of
London.

“Eternal Vigilance.”
Harthur, the Melbourne
Cockatoo, bustled into his Can-
berra office, and a thoughtless
observer might have wondered if
he was debating with himself
which was the greater in im-
portance; Harthur’s job or
Harthur himself. But that
would have been absurd—
Harthur already knew that one.
The chief accountant of his
department was waiting on him.
“About that unexpended bal-
ance of the department’s esti-
mates that you are anxious to
liquidate, Mr. Calwell,” he said.
“You mentioned about making
a super-film, you recall.”
The Melbourne Cockatoo
nodded his poll vigorously.
“Yes, that’s right,” he said.
“I’m determined to have made a
colossal, a stupendous fillum to
advertise to the world the free-
dom enjoyed by the individual
in this country. No pushing-
round by Governments as
in less fortunate lands. Allot
fifty thousand for it —no, better
make it a hundred and fifty
thousand. What odds, it’s only
the taxpayers’ money. We
can”
Harthur looked up as a clerk
came in holding some forms.
“Well, what is it?” he asked.
“Applications by four girls for
permission to go to Hawaii for
six months to jobs there, sir,”
the clerk replied.
The Melbourne Cockatoo’s
gorge rose. “The hide of these
people!” he squeaked. “Where
do they think they’re living, any-
way—in a democracy? We’ll
“ Somebody's OILED that blasted gate!”
have to do something about
these Australian girls; they’re
becoming so arrogant they think
they have the right to work
wherever they want to! I’ll
soon show them who’s master
here!" And he grabbed the
forms and scribbled “Permis-
sion refused” against each one.
After he had handed the
forms back to the clerk the Mel-
bourne Cockatoo turned again
to his department’s chief ac-
countant.
“Now, about this super-fillum
we’ll make on the unexampled
liberty enjoyed by the Aus-
tralian citizen,” he resumed. “I
was thinking it’ll look better in
color. Allot two hundred
thousand the taxpayers
wouldn’t want us to be lousy
with their money. Properly
handled, the fillum should be a
powerful propaganda agency to
attract the best types of Levan-
tine hawkers, Left-wing Polish
Zionists, Hungarian gypsies,
Rumanian ex-politicians, Al-
banian Palace revolutionaries,
Croatian goatherds, Slovene
cheese-musterers and Ruthenian
barge-pushers —in short, anyone
who’ll break down the too-high
percentage of British blood in
our population and who will at
the same time help Mr. Chifley
achieve his object of increased
production by setting-up ‘Mos-
cow’ shops and suchlike. Be-
sides, people like that will be
the ‘Labor’ party’s natural sup-
porters in a few years. We
shall also”
“Excuse me, sir,” interrupted
the clerk, “but a bricklayer is
outside wanting to interview
you. You will recall, sir, that
he applied for a passport to go
to Singapore to a job that was
waiting for him. He wants to
know why you wouldn’t allow
him to leave the country.”
The Melbourne Cockatoo’s
comb came up like the hairs
on a cat’s back. “Well, this is
the absolute limit of impu-
dence! ” he barked. “Who’s he
to want to leave the country;
and who’s he, anyway, to think
he has the right to leave the
country? Tell him I said he can’t
go, and what I say goes! Now,
no more interruptions—l want
to discuss a film we’re going to
make on the liberty enjoyed by
the Australian citizen.”
Shortly afterwards Harthur
was closeted with the film
executives of the D. 0.1. and
telling them what he wanted re-
garding the film. “Now, don’t
forget, boys,” wound up
Harthur at last. “This is to be
a sort of celluloid monument to
the unexampled freedom en-
joyed by Australians. The
theme to be hammered on is
that here in this fair young
land everyone is at perfect
liberty to follow what calling he
likes where he likes. We’ve got
to stress that there’s none of the
coercion and force such as is
used in less enlightened lands.
We gotta stress the yuman
dignity we enjoy, also that the
cradle of liberty in this land of
ours is the ‘Labor’ party. Now,
we might start the fillum off,
say, with a happy-faced girl just
about to leave her home —one
of those three-bedroom brick
bungalows that our D. 0.1.
pamphlets in London say can be
built here for nine hundred and
eighty-five quid about to
choose the job she likes best,
and”
Just then a clerk came in
holding a form. “Cable just re-
ceived from Mr. Makin, sir,
saying he is taking up with the
U.S. State Department about an
extradition order to bring back
to Australia the girl secre-
taries working in Manila who

give up their jobs and come
home. I’ve sent .the cables you

General and the F. 8.1. Oh,

For a moment the Melbourne
Cockatoo froze in his seat, turn-
ing pea-green around the gills.
Then he leaped into action.
“Well, well, bring it in so I can
approve it. Don’t stand there
—we mustn’t keep Mr. Sharkey
waiting!”

“White Exploiters”
If Ward had been any kind of Minister
he would have had those “white ex-
ploiters” (B. 6/10/’4B) decorated with the
Empire’s highest awards, and revived the
custom of making them land grants for
outstanding service to their country, leav-
ing them to “exploit” in peace what they
earned so valiantly in war.
When Japan swooped on the island-
chain these “exploiters,” armed with little
else than pistols, and carrying heavy
radio-sets, retired to the jungle, there to
observe enemy movements for our
“bases” at Moresby and, later, Lunga
on Guadalcanal. Hunted, ill-equipped and
poorly fed, they revealed enemy concen-
trations with such accuracy that Jap
supply-ships and barges were destroyed
wholesale and Jap outposts left wide
open for successful attack.
The Tokyo Express failed in its efforts to
relieve Guadalcanal for the simple reason
that every time a destroyer left Buka
Passage for its southward run through
the islands it was kept under continuous
watch until in a position for American
divebombers to skittle it For this service
alone the Coastwatchers were highly com-
mended by high-ranking American naval
officers, who realised the supreme need
for reliable information.
Robertson, Seton, Williams, Fairfax-
Ross, Read and Mason—all were Coast-
watchers whose names were synonyms for
tenacious courage in the staff-rooms of
the south-west Pacific campaigns.
I knew Lieutenant Seton rather well
—he has now returned to Choiseul Island,
where he spent 15 months with Williams,
reporting Jap ships and aircraft. He
was aboard H.M.A.S. Colac when that
ship attacked Jap installations in the
Bougainville Strait. His infallibly
accurate knowledge of where the Nip had
planted his men and barges contributed
largely to the success of the operation,
despite the fact that the vessel was caught
in enclosed Choiseul Bay and crippled
by enemy shellfire. I was aboard her at
the time, and had many long conversa-
tions with the big man, during which he
revealed, quite casually, that the sweetest
food he ever ate was Japanese canned
mandarins, taken from their camps while
they searched the hills for him and his
party.
I met the other Coastwatchers on
several occasions and had personal ex-
perience of their courage during my
four years in the New Guinea area.
Many more of them would be alive
today but for the treachery. of
natives whose interests Mr. Ward now
holds so tenderly to his bosom.
But “Labor” today is too thickheaded
to realise that men who could fight so
valiantly for their own property would
neither exploit the land nor abuse its
inhabitants. — Young Slim (W.A.).
Pioneers* Reward
In the Clermont district (Q.) 80 years
ago a family started to build a herd of
Hereford cattle from “scrubber” begin-
nings. After three generations of in-
tensive industry the herd now equals the
best in Australia.
Death lately came to some members
of the family, and £20,000 probate duty
had to be met. So a station, the lease
of which has nearly run out, and its
6000 head of cattle were sold for £50,000.
The income tax on the sale was £23,000,
which, added to the probate, made the
Government’s whack £43,000.
Yet the spenders ask us to “co-ordinate”
beef production.— Hadley Propsting
(Q-).
Radio Aids
There are no two ways about the
advantage of having a radio-operator (B.
6/10/’4B) to check and change frequency
(aeradio frequencies are often too
crowded for navigational work) and ser-
vice the equipment if necessary while the
pilot is busy and the aircraft in trouble.
In such circumstances the pilot cannot use
h.f.-d.f. aids unless he is close enough to
the home strip to obtain q.d.ms.
(“courses to steer”) by voice. A radio-
operator who can give his whole atten-
tion to the morse-key can fix the air-
craft’s position in a matter of seconds,
even from d.f. stations hundreds of
miles away. Voice may not cut through.
He can switch quickly to c.w. or m.c.w.
according to instruction from the ground.
A first-class P.M.G. ticket doesn’t enable
a pilot to be in two places at once.
If necessary, the radio-operator could
obtain a series of q.d.ms. on which the
pilot could “horjie” his aircraft to any
strip in Australia from almost any point
on the continent. Further, h.f. cathode-
ray d.f. provides a “q.g.h. approach”
procedure specially for bad-weather con-
ditions, by which an aircraft can be
safely landed on a strip when visibility
is nil.
The degree of unreliability of h.f.-d.f.
in bad weather is negligible. The
system can operate over such a wide
area that an aircraft can obtain help
from many stations even if one or two
should be temporarily unable to give
a bearing or q.d.m. An electrical
storm surrounding an aircraft would
show up in a distant d.f. station as a few
intermittent streaks near the centre of
the cathode-ray tube screen. The trans-
mitted signal from the ’plane is a line or
ellipse of a different character and can
be read easily, even through serious
static-flashes.
The true value of h.f.-d.f. has never
been fully realised because of the re-
markable fact that, while the R.A.A.F.
spent thousands of pounds in erecting
some 25 or 30 stations and training
operators over an 11-months course,
crews of aircraft were never made
“After you've been here a while you'll get used to the typhoon season."
familiar with the procedure for using the
aid. I flew with w.a.gs. who had never
heard of it; with many who knew of
it but nothing of its application; and
with one who asked me what was meant
by the reciprocal of a bearing. Some
pilots, too, foolishly regarded the calling
for a bearing as an admission to other
crew members that they were lost, and
were consequently reluctant to ask.
When “homing” on q.d.ms., errors of
up to several degrees merely cause the
plane to follow a slightly longer—per-
haps zigzag—course, but the more fre-
quently the q.d.ms. are obtained the
straighter becomes the line of flight.
The Lutana could have safely navi-
gated on q.d.ms. or fixes all the way
from Brisbane —provided there had been
a radio-operator in the aircraft. Even
had there been extensive errors —which is
improbable—they would only have meant
a late but certain arrival. V.h.fs. may
ultimately find their own in navigational
aids, but in the meantime there is much
to be said for the long and comforting
arm of h.f.-c.r.-d.f. — Luke (N.S.W.).
Land Settlement
The general policy for settling ex-
servicemen on the land is, apparently, to
acquire large holdings and cut them into
several blocks. That’s all very well, but
all over Australia there are thousands of
smaller properties of, say, 4000 or 5000
acres which are not producing one-half
of what they should, simply because the
owners can make a comfortable living
without carrying out any improvements.
Take my case. I’m a young service-
man working and living in a country
district where I’d like to take up a small
block and run a few sheep. The entire
district within three-miles radius is taken
up by three or foul sheepmen, all of
whom are grazing sheep on unimproved
land, running up to 3000 head on
property that could run 10,000 if it were
looked after and properly cleared. They
don’t even bother to burn the mill-
tops and logs in their paddocks.
I’d like to buy one of their paddocks.
But rather than sell one acre they’d
prefer to buy-out their neighbors.
All such properties could easily spare
500 or 600 acres. The only difference
would be that the owners would then
have to bend their backs and make some
improvements on what they had left.
At the moment I’m looking out on a
1000-acre paddock which has not had
one head of stock on it for two years.—
Master-Bevel (Vic.).
Two Parties?
It may be true, as W. H. Spooner says
(B. 29/9/’4B), that most non-Socialists
would like to see a single party opposed
to Labor, but that does not necessarily
mean that they want to see the Liberal
party swallow the Country party. Before
that can happen the Libs have a good
deal to live down. They have changed
their name three times in 30 years, and
they have been too ready to accept, even
as leaders, Socialists who have fallen-out
with official “Labor.” Their association
with the Q.P.P, in Queensland is watched,
by country people at least, with some
misgiving, as the founder of that group
has just socialised Brisbane’s bus system.
The Country party, with all its faults,
has a solid record of achievement. For
some time, when Socialists were in the
ascendant in the U.A.P., as it was then
called, they were the only real Liberal
force in the national Parliament. Until
they are sure that will not happen again,
they cannot disband.
But there is room for doubt whether,
at any time, the interests of the nation
would be best served by two parties only
—Liberals and Socialists. A smaller
third party would seem to blur the sharp
edges of this division, and hinder the
splitting of the whole country into two
irreconcilable camps. There is a parallel
in England, where, as Mr. Spooner’s
leader has recently reported, the Conser-
vatives accuse the Liberals (the small
party in that country) of taking votes
from them and letting “Labor” in, whereas,
in actual fact, nearly half the Liberal
voters would vote “Labor” if their party
disappeared. The significance of the
position in both countries is that, if either
of the big parties is tempted to any abuse
of temporary power, its moderate
supporters are more likely to drift away
to a centre party than to its main
opponent, and thus bring it to earth
the sooner.
In the present emergency it is the plain
duty of both non-“ Labor” parties to strive
for full co-operation in defence of
democracy. With our preferential-voting
system there is no reason why they should
not each nominate a candidate for the
same seat, if the preferences of the
electors is in doubt, or put up a man
acceptable to both, as was done with
such success in Capricornia in the last
election. —I. B. C. (Q.).
Country Towns and Migration
Mr. Calwell’s reported belief that all
country towns will double their popula-
tions in the next 30 years is, as far as
N.S.W. is concerned, a credit to his
optimism rather than his judgment.
Basing his hopes on the inflow of
migrants to provide the necessary in-
crease, Calwell may be half-right, for
the biggest country towns will un-
doubtedly benefit from immigration. But
the small ones, money-tight, drably un-
interesting and lacking in opportunities,
won’t attract many newcomers.
Apart from the metropolitan and in-
dustrial areas —Newcastle, Lithgow, Port
Kembla —which will get the lion’s share
of any population increase, N. S. Wales
country towns may be sized-off into three
grades.
First come the big main centres, such
as Goulburn, Grafton, Lismore, Bathurst,
Wagga and Albury. All of these leading
towns have over 10,000 people, all are in
good country, and all are on the right
side of the 20in.-rainfall line. Given
reasonable-scale secondary industries and
the more intensive settlement of their
districts, these already well-grown agri-
cultural and communications centres
should have a bright future.
Next in order are the middling group
—3OOO- to 8000-population towns like
Taree, Kempsey, Murwillumbah, Moree,
Inverell, Parkes, Forbes and Coota-
mundra. The outlook for these places
varies according to locality—generally
speaking, those in the coastal areas have
better prospects than those inland, some
of which seem to be reaching the limits
of their development.
Last come the small centres —up to
3000 people. These little places have
poor outlooks. Some of them are already
dying on their feet. Motor trans-
port, by bypassing them, is killing them.
With road-haulage, all marketing distri-
bution and mechanical processing can be
centred in a relatively few large towns.
Farmers now pass through the villages
without stopping on an easily-covered
20-30 mile drive to their nearest big town.
The day of the small country town in
Australia is over, except for places like
Flay and Bourke which are sufficiently
isolated to maintain themselves. With a
few exceptions, the rest must face stag-
nation. Coraki, on the Richmond, was
once a thriving and important river port,
but now it is somnolent and insignificant,
its municipality, newspaper and butter
factory all gone.
Generally speaking—apart from Broken
Hill, which will live only as long as its
silver-ore —the foregoing represents the
outlook for our country towns as
migrant-bait. Newcomers to the State
will naturally go where life and
opportunity seem brightest—that is,
most of them will eventually drift
to Sydney. The bigger provincial
centres, getting their cut of the rest, may
in a generation double their present
populations. The little ones, once more
bypassed, may have a struggle to avoid
halving theirs. —K. A. S. (N.S.W.).
The Good Old Days
Reading of Australian life in the
’nineties, as portrayed in Lawson’s While
the billy Boils, I’m thankful I live in pre-
sent times. Even with the high cost of
living and other temporary hardships of
today, I’ve never noticed anyone starving
or in rags and everybody seems to enjoy
a certain degree of comfort.
If you can’t buy a “luxury” item for
cash, there’s “extended credit,” a system
deplored a decade or two ago but now
accepted as essential in domestic econo-
mies. In 20 years of wage-earning I’ve
never experienced any appreciable differ-
ence between the weekly pay and the cost
of living. There was always just a narrow
margin.
And today there’s the promise of better
things to come. We must look forward
to that rather than become imbued with
the nostalgia of the “old school,” for
ever sighing for the “good old days.”—
C.A.L. (W.A.).
Root of the Matter
Walter Burley should be honored as
the architect of Canberra (B. 29/9/’4B),
but the late Austin Chapman should not
be overlooked. He fought as no other
politician fought for the establishment of
the Federal capital. I often heard him
debating his pet theme when the Com-
monwealth Parliament met in Melbourne.
In those days he was a sick man, yet his
enthusiasm was boundless. The fact that
he never lived to see Canberra is an added
reason why his memory should be per-
petuated. Although a supporter of the
then Nationalist Government, he was a
most caustic critic. He was not a great
statesman, but he never had his price.—
A. D. (S.A.).
The prying into the affairs of A. W.
Fadden reminded me that, at the end of
March, the Orange (N.S.W.) branch of
the Liberal party sought the co-opera-
tion of the local Labor league in asking
the Prime Minister to declare the Com-
munist party illegal. In his reply, re-
ceived several weeks later, the Labor-
league secretary said, “.... we are assured
that the Federal Government has set up
machinery to control the activities of all
opposition parties, viz., Communist party,
Peoples’ Freedom party, Australian
Liberal party, Country party and Aus-
tralia First party.”—K. Me. (N.S.W.).
If “New-Stater” (B. 6/10/’4B) applies
to the Mayor of Ballina (N.S.W.) he will
probably find that gentleman in full
agreement with “Norther’s” statement
(B. 15/9/’4B) that there is stagnation,
stark and undisguised, in the New-State
movement. Last week, in answer to a
petition, he convened a public meeting
and five townsfolk turned up.— Bungle
