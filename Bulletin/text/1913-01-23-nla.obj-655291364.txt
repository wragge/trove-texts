Wanted : Half-a-Dozen Assorted
Australasian Literary Shrines
The Red page
Has Australia or Maoriland any genuine
literary shrines? Douglas Sladen states that
Gordon’s tomb is “the Mecca of Australian
literature”; but a tomb doesn’t make a com-
fortable or even a well-ventilated shrine.
It isn’t the place where a genius ended his
life, but the place where he lived his life,
that is wanted. Thus, if Stead is to have a
shrine, no one would consider the bottom of
the North Atlantic Ocean, or the stomach of
a North Atlantic shark, as a fitting and
tidy shrine. A literary shrine is some habi-
tation or locality which some literary bloke
has by his life or his work identified with
himself. It is some place that can be re-
garded as belonging to the history of that
bloke. It has been suggested, for instance,
that “Dingley Dell,” the cottage near Port
McDonnell, in which Gordon lived after his
marriage, should be acquired for the pur-
pose of a literary shrine by the S.A. Gov-
ernment.
It is admitted that Australasian condi-
tions, and chiefly the Australasi n habit of
shifting homes, do not encourage the intense
cultivation of a particular locality for a
shrine. But it is quite time we had at
least six literary shrines to inflict upon tour-
ists : these might conceivably make our liter-
ary visitors think that we are a literary
nation. And the Tourist Bureau could be
depended upon to get out a nice little
booklet on our shrines, and run cheap ex-
cursions and install caretakers to receive
the tips. But it is first necessary to select
the most worthy shrines. Any contributor
who thinks he has a genuine Australian or
Maoriland literary shrine concealed about
his neighborhood is hereby invited to forward
particulars of his claim for inclusion in the
half-dozen to be selected by this page. No
prize will be awarded ; but space-rates will
be paid for all articles printed.
Synge
Who was Synge? According to P. P.
Howe, in J. M. Synge: A Critical Study
(Martin Seeker, per Angus and Robertson,
Sydney), “In all the English drama, from
Sheridan and Goldsmith to Mr. Shaw, there
is only one name that will go up among the
greatest, and that is the name of another
Irishman, J. M. Synge It would be diffi-
cult to name another contemporary whose
perdurable qualities are more certain.” And
Francis Bickley, in J. M. Synge and the
Irish Dramatic Movement, in Constable’s
series of “Modern Biographies,” writes:
“Synge wrote six plays; one of them left
incomplete, two of them very short, none
long, enough to f\ll the stage for a London
evening. On these he has established a
reputation which was high at his death, has
grown since, and seems as likely to be per-
manent as that of any man of his genera-
tion. It has been claimed for him that he is
the greatest imaginative dramatist who has
written English since Shakspeare, or, at
least, since the. Puritans closed the theatres
in 1642. The claim is not as big as at first
sight it looks; and even the conservative
will find it hard to gainsay.”
So, already the critics are lifting to a
place beside that of Shakspeare an obscure
Irishman who died in 3909. This, of course,
will be rank blasphemy to all the Shak-
speare societies in the world —though that,
really, won’t matter —and. incidentally, it
will be rather annoying to the German pro-
fessors of philology. Let us examine the
evidence.
J*
John Millington Synge was born in Ire-
land in 1871, was educated at Trinity Col-
lege. went thence to Germany, travelled
much in Europe on an income of £4O a
year, and returned to Paris to read French
literature in a top-floor room in a Latin
Quarter students’ hotel. Here W. B. Yeats
discovered him, and looking at his scrib-
blings. found such promise in the man, who
was quite evidently on the wrong literary
track, that he said: “Give up Paris. You
will never create anything by reading
Racine, and Arthur Symons will always be
a better critic of French literature. Go to
the Arran Islands. Live there as if you
were one of the people themselves; express
a life that has never found expression.” And
Synge went—to create a new drama. He
wrote his six plays, for which he got no
money, and which had all an indifferent
first reception in Ireland; and died, un-
married, a drifting, silent man, who never
spoke of himself, in 1909. That is all.
Till his thirtieth year he achieved nothing.
In less than six years he produced his six
imperishable plays: the two one-act plays.
Riders to the Sea and In the Shadow of the
Glen; the two-act play, The Tinker's Wed-
ding; and the three plays in three acts:
The Well of the Saints, The Playboy of the
Western World and Deirdre of the Sorrows.
P. P. Howe devotes to these works an
analysis meticulous, loving and reverent.
Beside his big book.. Francis Bickley’s brief
biography is a slight thing.
&
Synge may justly be credited with having
discovered a new language, the almost Eliza-
bethan language of the modern Irish pea-
santry.
When I was writing The Shadow of the
Glen, I got more aid than any learning could
have given me from a chink in the floor of
the old Wicklow house where I was staying,
that let me hear what was being said by the
servant girls in the kitchen.
Says Yeats: “Synge wrote down words
and phrases wherever he went.” But from
his published note-books, in which nothing is
invented and nothing that is essential is
changed, we may find the germ of all his
plays, as well as the germ of all his
speeches, but how by the art of the drama-
tist these crude realities are sublimated
by Synge! He, like Shakspeare, was a
snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, but made
the same use as Shakspeare of his trivial
treasure-trove. Synge went straight to life
tor his material, but in the manufacture of
his plays lie utterly transformed his
material.
Strain, intensity, tension —these are the
words most often on his lips (in his note-
books). It is likely that Synge lived at an
almost intolerable pitch of sensibility to life.
.... Synge’s plays are fully charged and
quivering with his temperament. .. .Above
all other cares, is his care for form.... Ba-
lance, measure and patience, these three—
“just what the Celt has never had,” said
Arnold —Synge has. Having them, he may
take joy in all that is wild and unsubdued
and excessive, and make nevertheless an art
that in its suggestion of an ancient order, in
its calming and grave beauty, has something
in it that is Greek.... Synge drenched his
plays in beauty.. . .Synge put a wistfulness
and passion of his own into this speech of
the Irish peasant, as he thinks in Irish and
speaks in English : he made of it a prose of
the most beautiful cadences, varied and
magical and profound ; a fit vehicle for great
drama.
And Howe asks, “Did Irish people, drunk
or sober, ever speak with just the richness
and copiousness of Michael James?” And
answers: “It does not matter.” It doesn’t.
Riders to the Sea has been acclaimed the
finest one-act play in the English language.
It seems difficult to dispute that claim. As
Francis Bickley says :—-
It is one of those achievements before
which the voice of criticism is dumb. Tiny
as is its scale, it is as plainly stamped with
greatness as Hamlet or the Agamemnon.
War
Never before have the sordid horrors of war
been pictured as Gustaf Janson, a Swede,
has etched them in his collection of
stories called Pride of War (Sidgwick and
Jackson, per Sydney Book Club). The
author has taken tne scrimmage in Morocco
for his battleground, and he shows 'the de-
ceits and the dishonor that underlie the
glories of that shameful piece qf piracy. In
the first sketch we see the slow taming by
the military system of a recruit who, when
asked by the non-com. his trade, proudly
replies, “Anarchist!” The ordeal of battle
removes the scales from his eyes. Instead
of shouting “Long live Anarchy !” he learns
to shout “Long live war!” for he sees at last
that war is Anarchy—organised and per-
fected.
“This pitiful Anarchy battened on wild
words in secret places, and never went fur-
ther than an outrage on single individuals.
A fraud! Here was something different,
something great, sublime ! To seize a whole
nation by the throat and conquer, kill, wipe
them out!”
Gustaf Janson knows the Turk, the Arab
and the Dago ; and his stories give the reader
a just and adequate understanding of the
psychology of these races, while his descrip-
tion of that warfare in the desert has a
vividness and actuality the lack of which
seems to be the one distinguishing mark of
famous war-correspondents. One of the most
striking of these stories shows a celebrated
archaeologist so worried by the in-
justice of this grab for territory that
he enlists and goes to the front.
His step is determined by a visit paid
by him to the. Campagna surrounding Rome,
where he found a desert worse than that of
the Sahara, and a poverty more horrible than
that of any Bedouin. “Was it really con-
ceivable.” he thought, “that the Italian Gov-
ernment proposed to transform the deserts of
Tripoli into cultivated land, while suffering
the. pestilential area of the Campagna to re-
main in the condition in which jit had been
so long?” And at the front tie archgeolo-
gist. investigates one by one the lies of war,
and dies, shot bv the mistake of an Italian
sentry, before he can publish his book. But
this work of Janson is just the book that
an acute observer would have produced.
The final story shows us a Dago airman
methodically dropping bombs on the defence-
less Turks. In its curt phrases this account
gives a shuddersome indication of the horrors
that will accompany all future wars.
The series of “Philosophies. Ancient and
Modern,” published by Constable at Is., use-
ful books for the serious-minded, now in-
cludes Rationalism, by J. M. Robertson,
and Pragmatism, by D. L. Murray. In his
introduction to the latter work F. C. S.
Schiller remarks that William James’s
Pragamatism. great as it was as a w,rrk af
genius, was intended mainly for the man in
the street. “It was so lacking in the fami-
liar philosophic catchwords that it may be
doubted whether any professor has quite
understood it-” This defect —in our vulgar
opinion its special excellence—the present
primer overcomes. But Pragmatism has
gone beyond its promulgator, and James’s
manual no longer covers the whole ground ;
and the present simply worded volume pre-
sents a complete and up-to-date survev of
the field.
Conrad
It is, good to find Joseph Conrad once
more back in the tropical archipelago of his
youth, amid those islands of "romance that
gave a startled, delighted world Almeyer and
Lord Jim; and now in 'Twixt Land and
Sea (Dent, per Dymock’s Library, Sydney)
lie adds to those unfading portraits of subtle
souls a little gallery of minor portraits, not
so impressive, but as carefully, as seriously
and as brilliantly limned. Here in "Freya
of the Seven Isles,” in “The Secret Sharer,”
and in “A Smile of Fortune,” Conrad cre-
ates once again the overpowering impres-
sions of tropical languor and tropical pas-
sion, and contrives to make the human
drama but an emanation, an inevitable flow-
ering out, of the scenes in which it is set.
In “A Smile of Fortune” there is a strange
girl, “sitting there in the obscurity, with her
heavy hair and empty eyes as black as the
night itself, staring into the walled garden,
silent, warm, odorous with the perfume of
imprisoned flowers, which, like herself, were
lost to sight in a world buried in darkness.”
Surely never such a girl could exist outside
the prison of her walled garden, nor surely
nowhere else could such a curious love-affair
have taken place. And the heavy price of
the kiss given by the ship captain to this
sulky, beautiful, ignorant outcast becomes,
by Conrad’s fine irony, a smile of fortune.
For the purchase of a cargo of potatoes,
which the girl's rascal of a father had com-
pelled the captain to make, instead of be-
coming the dead loss to which, penitent, he
was willing to submit, turns nut to be a
fine investment. His ship arrives, cluttered
with potatoes, at Port Phillip, to find Aus-
tralia in the dead-end of a drought with all
root crops destroyed.
' “The Secret Sharer” is the story of a cap-
tain who has to keep hidden in his cabin a
man fleeing from a charge of murder. The
strain of keeping his secret and the terror
of his discovery is raised to the highest
pitch by the delicate psychological art of the
author. “Freya of the Seven Isles” is a
love story with a Dutch villain, who ranks
with the finest of Conrad’s scheming rogues,
The revenge of that scowling, fat, jealous
man has in it a surprising malignity even
despite Conrad’s careful preparation for his
climax. As in all these stories, this narra-
tive is lit with marvellous descriptions of the
tropics. One sentence :
“For days the ‘Neptun’ could be seen
moving smoothly up and down the sombre
face of the shore, or hanging about with a
watchful air near the silvery breaks of broad
estuaries, under the great, luminous sky
never softened, never veiled, and flooding the
earth with the everlasting sunlight of the
tropics—that sunshine which, in its un-
broken splendor, oppresses the soul with an
inexpressible melancholy more intimate,
more penetrating, more profound than the
grey sadness of the northern mists.”
Though none of these stories is equal in
dramatic intensity to such masterpieces as
Youth or Typhoon, none of them contains
work below the high Conrad standard. The
importance of this collection of stories is
that it shows that Conrad is retracing his
steps toward the brilliant memories of his
youth.
The Brontes
“It is impossible to write of the three
Brontes and forget the place they lived in,
the black-grev, naked village, bristling like a
rampart on the clean edge of the moor ; the
street, dark and steep as a gully, climbing
the hill to the Parsonage at the top: the
small, oblong house, naked and grey, hemmed
in on two sides by the graveyard, its five
windows flush with the wall.-staring at the
graveyard where the tombstones, grey and
naked, are set so close that the grass hardly
grows between.”
There the story of the Bronte sisters be-
gins. But more particularly it begins in
that tiny room in the parsonage, “no bigger
than a closet and without a fireplace.
“For it was in this incredibly small and
insufferably unwholesome den that the five
little girls were packed, heaven knows how;
and it was here that the seeds of tubercu-
losis were sown in their fragile bodies. After
their mother’s death, the little fatal room
was known as the children’s study (you can
see, in a dreadful vision, the six pale little
faces, pressed together, looking out of the
window on to the graves below.)”
In the bands of May Sinclair, as will be
apparent from these passages, the story of
The Three Brontes (Hutchinson, per liym-
ock’s Library) is treated with loving pity
and passionate sympathy. The thwarted
lives of these three girls, the story of their
starved woman-souls and their genius finds
in this foremost woman writer in England
such an historian as they would have chosen
for themselves. And in her analysis of the
works of Emily and Charlotte the author
evidences a rare critical faculty. The high
place she gives to Emily’s verse is more
than justified ; her tribute to the overlooked
Emily reaches a fine heat of fervent adora-
tion. It has been said that too much has
been written of the Brontes; but this vindi-
cation by so admirable a writer should dis-
lodge from its place many a dusty volume of
Bronte criticism.
The Law
Arthur Train writes most interestingly
of Courts, Criminals and the Camorra
(Chapman and Hall, per Sydney Book
Club), the courts and criminals being those
of the United States variety.
“The most presumptuous of all presump-
tions is the ‘presumption of innocence.’ It
really does not exist, save in the mouths of
Judges and in the pages of law books.” The
natural presumption in the minds of a jury
is that the accused is guilty. “If out of a
clear sky Jones accuses liobinson of being
a thief we know by experience that the
chances are largely in favor of Jones’s accu-
sation being well founded. People as a rule
don’t go rushing around charging each
other with being crooks unless they have
some reason for it.... This natural pre-
sumption of guilt from the mere fact of the
charge is rendered all the more likely by-
reason of the uncharitable readiness with
which we believe evil of our fellows...;
However unfair, this is a psychologic con-
dition which plays an important part in
rendering the presumption of innocence a
gross absurdity.... Take the celebrated pro-
vision of the penal laws that the failure of
the accused to testify in his own behalf
shall not be taken against him. Such a
doctrine Hies in the face of human nature.
If a man sits silent when witnesses under
oath accuse him of a crime it is an inevi-
table inference that he has nothing to say—
that no explanation of his would explain.
The records show that the vast majority of
accused persons who do not avail themselves
of the opportunity to testify are convicted.
Thus, the law which permits a defendant
to testify in reality compels him to testify,
and a much-invoked doctrine of liberty turns
out to be a privilege in name only.”
Tx-ain analyses the motives of murder.
He finds that 75 per cent, of the killings
are due to quarrels over small sums or other
matters, drink and women; over 50 per
cent, to drink and petty quarrels; and about
30 per cent, to quarrels simply. In three
murders, tried in one week, the total amount
involved was only 85 cents. But these are
not the reasons why men kill. They kill
because they are the kind of men who want
to kill, who are ready to kill, who cannot
control the impulse to kill.
His chapter on detectives deprives us for
ever of Sherlock Holmes and his numerous
imitators. A real detective requires merely
honesty and obedience and some horse-sense.
The usual work of a detective does not de-
mand any extraordinary powers of deduc-
tion at all. As for disguises, one of the
managers of a prominent detective agency
remarked: “When we want a detective to
take the part of a plumber we get a plum-
ber." It is said that quite 50 per cent, of
the New York Detective Bureau have brains,
and Train adds: “That is rather a higher
average than one finds among clergymen
and lawyers, yet it may be so.”
The book should be sought after by
Gent. Onfe —and it might be consulted with
advantage by those who have to pay Gent.
One’s little bill.

Base Brands, by H. M. Somer, is—but
perhaps, for once, we may let the publisher,
the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., do his own criti-
cism. Well, then, according to the N.S.W.
Bookstall Co., the author “has produced a
book of uncommon merit, full of the dashing
adventure that accompanied sheep-stealing
and cattle-duffing in the early days, yet not
wanting in the threads of romance that are
always interwoven with the episodes of
human life. His portrayal of the daring
hero with the dual personality is an admir-
able piece of work .that will appeal strongly
to _ lovers of bush romance.” That’s the
opinion of the publisher, and he ought to
know. He says just as nice things about
Chandler of Corralinga, by R. J. Cassidy,
of which it seems Certain chapters have
appeared, in different form, in various peri-
odicals, among them The Bulletin. The
book is,, in its class, extremely well written.
A description of the ringing of the shearing
shed is graphically and tensely done. This,
it . may be necessary to mention, is the
opinion of the present critic, though he is
glad to note that the publisher cordially
agrees with him.
The one merit of picturing Australian life
as it was some 40 years ago is inherent in
Christopher Cockle's Australian Experi-
ences, by J. R. Iloulding (“Old Boom-
erang U, a book that has been out of print
for many years, now re-issued, after revision
by the author, by Angus and Robertson,
Sydney. It makes no pretence to style, and
the humor of it is, in these more sophisti-
cated days, extravagant.
Unitarians and Congregationalists will be
interested in the two latest shilling volumes
ser * es of “Religions, Ancient
a P c * Modern.” The author of Congrega-
tionalism is Benjamin A. Millard, that of
umtarianism, W. G. Tarrant.
The Salon (Weston, Wilson Co., Sydney,

ot Art and Architecture, continues to im-
prove. The Nov.-Dee. issue is lavishly illus-
trated and contains a number of good ar-
ticles on art topics.

century, and Tching-Pao reverted to wood blocks
Nowadays it uses both blocks and ordinary type-
metal characters. It is issued daily, and is really an
up-to-date rag, but pays poor screws.

Beautiful clip from the China Republican, con-
cerning its reptile contemporary: “In fact, it would
almost appear that certain journals of the type under
discussion are incapable of keeping their heads above
water except by stooping to wash dirty linen in order
to tickle the ears of the groundlings.”
“J. 0.8.”: Edward Ellis, who died lately in Mel-
bourne, is referred to by “Scribe” (B. 26/12/’l2)
as being most truly unlucky. Yet Ellis had several
spells of very good luck. He did well for a time on
Sydney Globe and Sunday Times. He not only
wrote well, but had good business instincts too. His
idea was to run the Globe seven days a week
But the directors of the company feared to send a
Sunday paper out of their office, as some advertisers
threatened to withdraw if the Sabbath was so dese-
crated. The chief directors were the late Toohevs
and Dr. Tarrant, and, though personally not squeam-
ish, the advertisers’ horror stopped them. Ellis
therefore took his Sunday Times to another street,
and was soon able to show that the proposition was
sound. lie then began making a hobby of art, and
got ready to launch out as a connoisseur of painting
and sculpture. Inch by inch he lost grip of the paper
he had founded, and finally the whole thing was
prised out of his hands.

Prosperous Moree (N.S.W.) has just welcomed a

Harry W. Cheesborough, writer of many a good
“Abo.” par. in The Bulletin.

While Lord Northcliffe has the highest opinion of
the female journalist, he has discovered that she has
her limitations, lie once started a journal that was
to be entirely brought out by women. “It was the
worst of my many failures,” he says. He soon discovered
that “ladies are not fond of taking orders from
ladies.” Also he found that no lady, however expert
she might be as a writer, could “make up” the paper
after it had been put into type ; and Northcliffe had
to “drag in a dour old Scottish foreman printer to
evolve some sort of order out of a chaos, and get the
paner out and away anyhow.” Northcliffe estimates
that from 50 to 60 per cent, of the “copy” for his
numerous publications is now turned out by women.

“U.S.”: The just-dead Whitelaw Reid is a lesson
in journalism. The old American stvle was broken
up by Bennett with the Herald. Greeley, with the
Tribune, had all the pull in public favor; yet
Bennett, an intensely unpopular man, beat him right
out. Greeley was a peerless writer, but Bennett
conquered him with news. Greeley was only held
up by his business manager, McElrath, and then by
Raymond, who afterwards established the New York
Times. Next came Whitelaw Reid, who prevented
absolute insolvency. Yet Reid had to submit to
being persistently told about the magnificent stvle
in which Greeley used to carry on the paper, and
so forth. Those people didn’t know that even a
Oarlvle or a Macaulay couldn’t write up a daily
Greelev was a k'nd of Stead ; but Stead knew where
the dollars were, while Greelev didn’t or wouldn’t

Adam Lindsay Gordon is still a strange poet to
some London editors. The man who runs the
Referee has been appealing for assistance in tracing
the lines:—
“Life is mostly froth and bubble;
Two things stand like stone — -
Kindness in another’s trouble,
Courage in your own.”
J. F. Hogan came to the rescue and added the infor-
mation that these best-known lines of Gordon’s “have
received a compliment in Canada not yet accorded
them in their native Australia, for they are engraved
on the memorial stone of a great charitable institu-
tion in Montreal.
THE SINGING JOURNALIST.
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a small fly in the ink,
A fierce mosquito buzzing nigh ;
A maddened moth has come to drink
The moistened anger in my eye;
Wild beetles drone across the night
And flop upon the thing I write.
Old poets sat beneath a vine ;
The air was resonant and sharp ;
They wrestled with a quart of wine
And thumbed their ditties on a harp ;
But I on common paper set
My lay of gladness and regret.
They, with their singing robes unloosed,
Sat tangled in their cornbless hair,
And anything that they produced
Was fit for gods and kings to share;
And pedants strove with eager pen
To save their verse for common men.
But I, with weary sweat of brain,
Amid this sultry atmosphere,
While mad cicadas shout for rain,
Hammer mv rhymes of love and beer
To help the weary world along
With inky substitutes for song.
Were Homer here in Sydney town,
Or Virgil camped at Neutral Bay,
Some hungry cow might eat the crown
They once accepted as their pay ;
For half-a-crown would please them more
Than ancient herbage that they wore.
The large commercial world is kind ;
Verse hath its rate of pence per line,
And golden poesy can find
A bard the wherewithal to dine ;
Wherefore when days are somewhat lean
He burns the midnight kerosene.
A cash transaction is the goal
Of all his fancies, flights and moods ;
The splendid raptures of his soul
Are known as marketable goods;
A toiler on the Inky Way
He does his job and takes his pay.
The scorn of scorn, the hate of hate
Which poets claim to be their dower
Are matters that must simply wait
I ill some kind cheque-book bursts in flower—
Vith journalistic instincts shod
this cab-horse Pegasus must plod.

lIS YOIR HAIR
'PALLING OUT?
Do not worry about the threat-
ened departure of youth and
beauty. Why not ?
Because, if there is a spark of
life remaining in the roots of the
hair,
Ayer's
Hair Vigor
will arouse it into healthy activity.
The hair will then cease to come
out, will begin to grow, will be
made soft and smooth, and all
without changing the color. Con-
sult your doctor about these hair
problems.
If you are weak and nervous,
and your digestion all out of
order, of course you must not
expect healthy hair; the hair
suffers with the rest of the body.
Correct any constitutional weak*
ness with a constitutional medi-
cine—Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

TOO THIN
WOMEN.
If you are
fl a t-chested,
thin, run
down and scragglv—even if you
never had a nicely-rounded
bosom, Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-food
will build you up and develop
your figure. Does your mirror
mock you? Flesh-food will re-
move the faults in your figure
by rounding out and developing
the deficient places. Put up in
Tablet form, it is easy to use and
pleasant to take, and, if desired,
may be taken secretly. Taken un-
der our directions, it will work
wonders for your appearance.
In many cases bust measure-
ments have been increased by over
ten inches, and the weight over five
pounds weekly. Other cases have
shown an increase in weight of
even a pound a day. The average
bust increase desired is about six inches, and is
readily accomplished. Results Guaranteed.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development to
the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable
figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to
attenuated women.
TOO FAT
PEOPLE.
Excess fat in-
jnres your
health, im-
pedes vour movements, ami
makes you the butt of your
unfeeling normal-weight friends.
People who have been fat, and
are now reduced to normal,
think other fat people ridicu-
lous.
Not alone does excess fat in-
jure your health and endanger
your existence, it absolutely de-
stroys your figure and makes
you a ludicrous sight. Why
do you stay fat? “EATCURE”
positively removes excess fat,
and will restore your spoiled
figure to decent and pleasing
proportions, and is always a
sure and lasting cure for
obesity and corpulency. A few
doses improves your breathing
wonderfully, and the course of
treatment will cure you.
It is the only successful, and, at the same
time, harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been
discovered. Its efficacy has been undeniably de-
monstrated in thousands of successfully treated
cas's. 't is totally and absolutely non-poison-
ous, and can in no wise work any injury to the
general health; though it often reduces excess
weight by as much as a pound a day.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that 1
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

Boots for Betty.
W m en Ive been , told by a tiny bird
lhat Betty’s in need of some winter
shoes,
My pen I take and my loins I gird,
And settle myself to seek the Muse.
I find my ink and I poise my pen,
And I think of the things I have not said;
And were I a wise man, then, oh then,
Is the moment Betty would go to bed!
But I haven’t the heart; so I let her stay,
And down we settle at once, we three;
Or try to, because I am bound to say
The Muses and Bettikin don’t agree.
And while I’m planning my rhythmic tricks,
And shaking the dull words into place,
It’s “Daddy, help me to build my bricks !”
Or, “Daddy, my Noah’s a broken face!”
Now, it’s hard enough, let it here be said,
To fashion, when left to yourself, a rhyme ;
And if Bettikin earlier went to bed
I could buy her the boots in half the
time!
But then, I’m her daddy, and much prefer
To any gift of a maudlin Muse,
A lisp from her lips or a smile from her,
So we’ll leave the future to find the shoes!

WILL H. OGILVIE.
The Conquering. Call.
We trod through ferns at close of day
Beneath a high-hung moon.
And climbed the dunes, and took our way
To the shores of a lit lagoon.
The tea-trunks in the moonlight white
As the bodies of dead men stood ;
And twice or thrice in the silent night
An owl cried in the wood.
A curlew, scenting danger, wailed
Along the reedy coast;
Across the lit lake slowly sailed
Black swans, a sable host.
They minded us of ships that don
Black palls for Vikings sped—
A dark, death squadron sailing on
To Islands of the Dead.
The moon shone pallidly on high—
A dead, cold world of stone.
The dying winds came here to die,
And died without a moan.
A murmur now, and now the heat
Of drums that valor preach,
We heard the onset and retreat
Of breakers on the beach.
The clamor stirred a strange desire —
The shout of warring seas.
Red-answering, our blood took fire,
And spurred us from our ease.
We turned (the stillness of the grave
Enwrapped the lit lagoon)
And sought the war-wrack of the wave
Beneath the high-hung moon.

A Night Voice.
There’s sunlight on the road,
And wattles spilling over
From shallow banks of shining creeks,
To clay sweet flats of clover.
Day is a throbbing joy
That holds me in its thralling,
But there’s a hunger in the night
Insatiably calling
In cosmic undertone—
Mute notes no season chaneres—
I’ve heard it crying in the pines,
And drifting up the ranges.
Or when the airs are low,
And tense strings mutely slacken,
The very silence pulsing by
Seems sobbing in the bracken.
And through the fathomless
Deep, surgeless seas of night
A planet freighted with cold fear
Drifts towards the infinite.
But day’s a throbbing joy,
W T ith sunlight spilling over,
And cry and sob are lost in light
Among the tufted clover!

Wine of Evening.
She wore a red rose at her breast,
Its sister in her hair;
And all the small winds of the west
Came rippling down the river’s rest
To kiss her unaware.
The laughing sun had bowed his head
Behind a cloud of fire:
The flaming west was tulip-red,
And golden maids their aprons spread
To catch the du&k’s desire.
All richly down the drooping day
Some clear voice throbbing strong
Had flooded dimpled bight and bay
As with an elfin roundelay
Of wild unfettered song.
As ’mid the darkness of her hair
My brown girl dreamed apart,
Tall eve with all her blushes fair
Was glad so sweet a flower to wear
Clasped to her shining heart.
And I, whom happy love made wise
And happy summer kind.
From the dusk wonder of her eyes
Drank the clear wine of Paradise
To make my hot soul blind.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no ease be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

A CHOICE OF TIGERS.
It is about six years now since the Liberal
party in the Australian Parliament offici-
ally discovered the Tiger of Socialism. At
intervals, ever since, those who are hostile
to progressive legislation have trotted the
animal out and used it for the purpose of
making the electors’ blood freeze. The
worker —and about 90 per cent, of adult
Australians are workers in one way or an-
other —was urged to shun the brute with
particular zest, since its operations tended
to raise the cost of living. Yet, wherever
the worker looked he saw that statement
discredited. He saw Socialistic bricks sell-
ing at fl a thousand less than those re-
tailed by the private-enterprise brick vend;
Socialistic trains which, with all their faults,
are wonderfully cheap and expeditious by
comparison with the company-owned and
administered services of other lands; cheap
Socialistic trams and dear private-enter-
nrise ones; chean and good fish emanating
from munieioal fish markets, and expensive
and poor fish where individualism held
sway. In brief, with all the will in the
world, the local domestic economist has
never been able to identify the Socialistic
tiger at its alleged practice of hoisting the
cost of living. There is at least one tiger,
though, which does—and in the full light of
day for all the world to see. Its name is
Trust, and it is also known by aliases such
as Vend, Monopoly, “Gentleman’s agree-
ment,” etc., etc.
In 1907, according to a memorandum
supplied to the Deakin Government of the
day by P. McM. Glynn, M.P., there were
33 distinct Trusts in Australia. As is
always the case in a Federation, they have
been growing in number year by year, not
'to say day by day. To those which were
already in existence a month ago one cover-
ing the moving-picture business has just
been added. A daily paper puts the latest
arrival this way :
An “arrangement” has just been concluded between
the principal importers of moving picture films.
Under it almost all competition between the various
vendors of films will be eliminated.
Mr. Mason, managing director of Clement Mason,
Ltd., declared that the proposition had been made to
him that the new “arrangement” would be interested
in close upon 600 programmes weekly, and that
the revenue from each would probably go up to the
extent of about £5 per week, which would mean
an additional income of £250,000 a year from pic-
tures alone.
“I don’t think there is any doubt that very shortly
the price of pictures will go up,” a director of one
suburban firm told a reporter. “In my view, that
is what the new ‘arrangement’ has been established
for.”
“And the result?” queried the interviewer.
“What can the result be?” was the answer. “We
have fixed our scale of charges on the basis of the
expenses of management. If our charges go up, as
I think they will, ive shall have to pass it on.”
And probably before this is printed some
other combination will be achieved. Efforts,
at any rate, are being made in that direc-
tion.
A question which the electors of Australia
will have to answer, by their votes, on next
Referendum day will be: Which animal is
the more menacing to the public welfare —
the so-called Socialistic tiger or the Trust
one? If, as is likely, they come to the con-
clusion that the tiger of Socialism is utterly
bogus, while the Trust tiger is a genuine
menace, they will without a doubt be still
pursued with a number of side issues to
induce them to vote against their own in-
terests. For example, now that the pre-
sence of the Trust has become so obvious
that it is no longer possible for Liberalism
to say “There are no Trusts,” as was said
freely in 1911, the argument is being ad-
vanced that if injurious combines do make
their appearance, the State is fully com-
petent to deal with them. It is the old lie
that was so popular in America in the ’Bo’s,
when most of the mammoth concerns of to-
day were in their infancy. The answer
simply is that the States cannot wipe out a
really powerful combine. It is not neces-
sary to go for an opinion beyond P.
McMahon Glynn, the soundest constitu-
tional lawyer on the Liberal side in the
Australian Parliament. In the Trust
memorandum already referred to, he re-
marked :—•
No State Acts can effectively meet the necessities
of the Trust case. It is clear that all Acts, Com-
monwealth and State, while covering operations of
persons or companies in different fields of jurisdic-
tion, should be similar in phrnort, or terms. Other-
wise the lawfulness of operations would depend on
locality, and similar facts might be made the basis
of different charges under the State and the Com-
monwealth Acts respectively. This would mean the
application to the same Acts of conflicting views or
standards of policy or morals, different rules as to
proof, on the same evidence conviction under one
iurisdietion and acquittal under another, and in
States without any legislation on the matter freedom
for the operations of the offending persons or com-
panies.
America, which has a similar Constitution to
ours, is engaged proving the truth of this
contention every day of its life. There is
hardly one State Legislature that has not
passed the most stringent anti-Trust laws
at one time or another. There is not one
U.S. citizen in a thousand that hasn’t
curses loud and bitter to hurl at the Trusts
of his native land. Every one agrees that
the country would be infinitely happier,
more moral and more prosperous if these
institutions could only be scotched. But
they can’t be. Securely entrenched behind
the sacred principle of State Rights, they
are able to defy the nation.
Moreover, the tendency of the small and
indigent State is rather to cherish its Trust
octopus, because in revenue, in the oppor-
tunity for employment that is offered, in the
cash that is circulated, and in the additional
trade which the huge business brings in its
wake, the State which tolerates it benefits
enormously. There is thus not a State-
fright Government in the Commonwealth
but would welcome the Beef Trust with
hearty cheers. And if the Australian Par-
liament protested, it would be coldly told
to attend to its own business.. A thing that
worries the Australian nationalist—mean-
ing the Australian who is as anxious that
all the States should get as fair a trade
deal as his own State —is the reflection that,
at present, this essentially Australian mat-
ter is out of the reach of the only Legisla-
ture which would handle it on its merits.
The Trusts are here. They are increasing
briskly in numbers and in size. The States
cannot touch them, and would not, in most
cases, if they could. Those facts are beyond
dispute. The main Tory argument against
supplying the National Parliament with the
power to deal with them is that anything
of the sort amounts to Socialism —which is
a ravening Tiger. The view of this paper
is that if Socialism —the harmless necessary
doctrine which we see in operation in every
street and house in the country—is a tiger,
fhen the Trust is 64 Zoos, with the uncon-
fined inhabitants of 15 jungles thrown in.
THE MANLY NATION.
A paper or “The Wastefulness of Armaments,” was
read by Mr. W. Siebenhaar, Deputy Government Stat-
istician of Westralia. He said the mani.y spirit of the
nation had throughout history been shown to afford
a safer guarantee of self-defence than expensive war
preparations. —Report of Science Congress.
When the great Aurelian wall of Rome
was being built, to include in its sweep the
densely populated suburbs of the big city, a
number of gentlemen in togas made severe
remarks about the undertaking, and pro-
fessed to remember the time when the
strength and manliness of the Roman was
a better defence of his home than all the
stone walls that could be erected. As a fact,
they couldn’t remember that time; but as
there had for several centuries been people
about who always declared that they could
remember it, the remembering business had
grown to be a glorious tradition, and every
Roman really thought that at one period of
the city’s history his ancestors had been so
tremendously brave that barbarian spears
wouldn’t stick in them, and that one
little person from the Palatine could
smash five big Gauls before breakfast. Cer-
tainly history holds no record of such
miracles. On the contrary, all indications
point to the fact that Rome always had
walls, and in its younger davs often had to
use them to keep out the swarthy Etruscan
or red-headed Celt, who had chased the city’s
warlike children in at the gate and was now
demanding entrance for himself. Some-
times he got in and sometimes he
didn’t; in any case, the bare Roman
manhood never took on a fight at a
disadvantage when it could get a piece
of rock to hide behind. It is perfectly true
that the armaments of primitive peoples were
of a simple nature. When warfare consisted
in picking up anything tolerably heavy a
hard, and chasing your enemy with it, pre-
paration was not very necessary; but even
in the days of the stone axe the tribe that got
ready the day before yesterday usually had
an advantage over the most manly sort of
war party that began to think about fight-
ing only this morning. The honors of war
went to the manly people who knew how to
use their manliness to best advantage.
Mr. Siebenhaar makes his appeal to
history, and history in a general way reveals
the fact that in the old days of catch-as-
catch-can warfare, when armaments counted
little, nations, as nations, didn’t fight at all.
England had probably a population of a
million or more in 1066, but only 30,000
men followed Harold to the supreme lick-
ing by the Normans at Hastings. Henry
V'. invaded and practically conquered France
with an army equal in number to the adult
males of one second-rate city of that king-
dom. Robert Bruce defended Scotland
against the English invader, and left the
name of Bannockburn as dear to his country-
men as that of haggis or bagpipes, but only
30,000 Scots thought it worth while fighting
for their country. Right along the line the
kings of the time of manliness and small
armaments gathered a handful or men to ac-
company them to death or glory, and the
rest of the nation stayed at home and felt
neither manly nor particularly interested.
Coming down even to more modern times,
when the nations were interested, if not to
the extent of taking part in the dangerous
business, at least in hearing or reading of
the engagements fought, the supremacy of
the mani.y nation that thought lightly of
armaments would be difficult enough to
prove. In the Napoleonic struggle England,
with inferior ships and guns, smashed the
fleets of Europe at sea. How does the
theory of national manliness fit in with this
striking business? In England at the time,
manly factory-owners were sweating the
lives out of thousands of miserable children
of five years old and upward, who were
forced to toil under the whip from daylight
to dark. The manly rustic was being trans-
ported for stealing a rabbit to eat, or hanged
for killing a sheep to save his starving
family. The manly footpad was out on all
highways and the manly smuggler busy along
all the coast. The manly naval contractor
was stealing the funds which should have
gone to make the sea armaments of Britain
equal to those of the French, and the manly
statesmen in office were winking at his theft.
All the while England’s very existence de-
pended on its fleet, but the manly manhood
of the nation thought so little of its national
duty that crews for the ships could only be
recruited from among the riff-raff of the sea-
ports by the desperate expedient of the press
gang. Not because of England’s manliness,
but in spite of its blindness, sloth, shirking
and lack of national spirit, did Nelson, with
his inferior fleets and ill-assorted crews, win
victories at sea. It was through the good
luck that enabled the one sea-genius of the
time to come to the front (and the manly
persons who tied red tape at the Admiralty
did their best to prevent it) that the
superior armaments of other nations were
broken and England won through.
It is very much to be doubted whether
even a higher manliness on the part of the
English people, which might have shown it-
self in ready enlistment and heroic devotion
to the national cause, would have availed
much against the fleets of Napoleon had it
not been for the one man who developed new
sea tactics that more than outweighed the
strength of the opposing armaments. But,
in any case, the game of war and national
defence is now so altered that scarcely any
lesson can be drawn from the events of a
century ago. The machine of war has been
more and more perfected. Napoleon’s Old
Guard would be mown down in quick time
by a single Maxim gun, and one torpedo
destroyer of the Australian navy could ac-
count in short time for all the fleets Nelson
ever commanded. No manliness or tactical
skill could of itself withstand the modern
armament. The veriest nation of cowards,
led by the most blundering of commanders,
must prove victorious over the most manly
of nations and the most skilled of leaders
who lack the devices of modern war. To
preach the_ uselessness of armaments in the
name of science is sheer treason to the logic
and induction that are the basis of all science.
More than this, to preach reliance on man-
liness rather than on the machinery of war
is sheer treason to the nation which may at
any time be called upon to resist armed in-
vasion. The armaments of the modern
nation are not to be created in a day. The
nation that has not 20 years of forethought
and steady preparation behind it is in a poor
way. Ships and guns once took weeks to
build, and much could be done towards per-
fecting a system of defence in a single year;
now ships and guns require years to produce’,
and the necessary time of preparation has
been enormously extended. If that prepara-
tion has been neglected, no amount of manli-
ness on the actual field of war can make
up for the neglect. It is a serious truth that
the great battles of the future are now being
fought in the workshops and dockyards, and
that above the strategist and tactician stand
the inventor and mechanic as the chief
factors in modern war.
But the absurdity of Siebenhaar’s un-
scientific argument which has been presented
in the name of science lies most of all in the
suggestion that manliness is opposed to the
use of the best devices available. Manliness
does out exclude intelligence, and the manly
nation which is in earnest about its national
affairs will be the first to use its intelligence
in the national interest. Thirty years ago
the Bulgarians became a nation —a manly
nation, if courage, high resolve and unshaken
belief in their own national destiny could
make them one. Immediately this manb
nation began preparations for war against
their hereditary enemies, the Turks. Year
after year they toiled to get their armament
to the highest possible point of perfection.
Though hampered by poverty and ignorance
and international troubles, they did their
level best to equip themselves in modern
fashion, and when at last the gauge of battle
was thrown down, their splendid courage
aided their long preparation to secure a
national triumph. Any nation which really
intends to remain a nation must follow the
same course. Australia has an infinitely
greater task before it in the defence of im-
mense territories with an army drawn from a
small and scattered population than that
which Bulgaria was called to face. By
stern and serious preparation of armaments
over all the years that may be left before
the starting signal is given, and tremendous
courage and much skill to back the previous
effort, the Commonwealth may just be able
to hold its own. Every manly sentiment is
in favor of securing everything in the way
of up-to-date armament that with our
limited means we can obtain. This manli-
ness is none too robust a growth at the pre-
sent moment, but the citizen army which is
in the process of formation makes for its de-
velopment. Let Aus f ”" l ia trust to its manli-
ness by all means, but let us not interpret
manliness to mean baresark rage when the
rage comes too late. The manliest nation is
the one which thinks too highly of its own
manhood to risk its destruction for lack of a
little foresight and self-sacrifice.
“CA’ CANNY.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Australian civilisation was started
with the gallows, the lash, the perpetuation
of ridiculous class distinctions, and a pint
of rum to each man and half a pint to each
woman, the Britisher, looking at his work,
saw that it was good, and that the settle-
ment must prosper. Later, he became
afeared that the new land would not re-
main sufficiently British, and he introduced
the rabbit, the fox, the starling and the
sweet briar; even the horehound and the
sparrow. Paddy thought he might forget
the ould sod, so he brought a few from Ire-
land ; Tonal’ hated to be parted from the
granite land that had kept him, and he im-
ported the thistle and the oft-indecent kilt
and the horror called bagpipes. Prodistans
and Catherlicks also introduced their sordid
differences, and the Walls of Derry begat
the Brunswick Road riots, and the riots
begat Snowball and Dill Macky. And
still the country couldn’t help making good.
Its native-born were full of that irreverence
which belongs to much sunlight and fre-
quent bathing and laughter and the habit
of not living in snow and catacombs, and
gradually they began to see that any way of
doing things is not necessarily bad because
it is not “English”—for to that word had
the most arrogant and ignorant and ineffi-
cient of three kingdoms reduced the word
“British.” They bore all the gibes about
being “un-British” when they wanted to do
anything new, and they were encouraged to
borrow because the U.lv. has a colossal
national debt, and to send soldiers to the
Soudan and South Africa to assist in a
purely local quarrel which had nothing to
do with Australia. They were retarded in
their effort to make Australia a nation be-
cause one Cobden had advocated Freetrade
for every Briton except himsef, and for
that reason they could not get and have not
yet got the almost prohibitive tariff that
Australia’s national resources loudly call
for; and still they kept on making good.
They carried compulsory service and an
Australian navy and anti-trust legislation
against the Freetrade gang. They made the
life of the workman within their borders
better than the life of any workman with-
out them. And then they went over the
mark. Trades Unionism in its haste got a
notion to_ do everything in a day, and as it
had nothing silly enough for its purpose in
Australia it imported Tillett and Mann to
preach a variant of the old-time capitalist’s
most usual form of theft. The old-time
capitalist had said, “A good day’s work for
a starvation wage” ; the early Trades Union-
ists in Australia said, “A fair day’s pay for
a fair day’s work”; the Manns and" the
Tilletts preached, “As much spoil as you
can get for the least possible effort”—that
degraded doctrine of “ca’ canny” first enun-
ciated by a sweated people of some cunning
and less strength as their only protection
against a system that could not be moved
by suffering either to justice or to pity.
True, Australia per head is still the richest
producing country on the earth. The out-
back Australian has not yet learned this
art 0-f “ca’ canny.” As drover or prospector
or miner, or as coachdriver taking Common-
wealth mails through 400 miles of drought
and flood every week for 605., he gives to
his work the last ounce of endurance and
the last atom of energy. But in the cities the
damnable doctrine of the Tilletts and the
Manns finds its active advocates, and in it
lies disaster. It takes the wage question out
of the hands of the Legislature, and makes
of it something dangerously approaching a
confidence trick. It means slipshod service,
shoddy products and the death of national
honesty.
When the minimum wage came into force
employers fought it bitterly until they saw
that it meant greater efficiency. In the
printing trade, for instance, the machinist
who was not worth the minimum 565. lost
his machine and turned to work at some-
thing demanding less skill. But the machin-
ist who was worth 70s. didn’t stay long on
obs. ‘ Ca’ canny” hadn’t come then.
The bricklayer with half his nroper tale
of bricks is an old offence, and his trouble
has spread. One concern, at least, in Syd-
ney is on the rocks because of “ca’ canny.”
In one job of the many I know, an outside
estimate for the laying of a floor in a small
mi°^ or ara £ e was 365. (three days at 125.).
lhe amount actually paid was 10 days at
l-.s. And there are scores of cases like that.
The public howls at the high price of
meat, and much of that high price is due to
ca canny.” With high rates and big bush


uess, how many carcase butchers are doing
well, or how many of them are even quite
solvent? Boners (men who bone fore-
quarters of beef for the preservers) are earn-
ing from £8 to £lO a week at lOd. a quarter ;
and one naturally thinks this fair, no matter
what the aggregate weekly earnings, for
here is piecework at a rate dictated by open
competition. But “ca’ canny” comes in on
the piecework, too. Mutton slaughtermen
are paid 275. 6d. per 100 sheep, and at that
rate a good man can make £0 a week, only
that lie is slowed down to the capacity of a
man so obviously inferior that one wonders
why he is placed in the same class. The
average number of sheep killed and dressed
per hour is seven. The master butchers de-
sired that the killing should be speeded to
nine, and the men refused. Yet the best of
these workmen, when once a big freezing
order had to be filled in quick time, killed
and dressed 22 sheep per hour. The man
who is capable of thus earning £8 or £9 a
week must stay at £4 or thereabouts, so that
the camp-followers’ work may not look too
glaringly disgraceful.
“Ca’ canny” might have been excused by
sentimental sympathy with the half-fed
earner of a sweated wage ; when it becomes
active not onlv under the fixed wage, but in
piecework under wholesome conditions of
work and payment, the patience of the com-
munity must be close to breaking strain.
And the sooner that noint is reached the
better, not only for Australia as a nation,
but for the man it saves from the fate that
waits for the loafer.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Peace Society Talk
At the moment when the intervention of
the Great Powers, in connection with the
Balkan war has signally failed, “Brother
John,” an opponent of military training
and suspected member of the Peace Society,
sends along a screed in which he upbraids
The Bulletin for having failed to encour-
age friendly relations with Germany, and
accuses Federal Minister Peabce of having
gone out of his way to insult that nation.
When The Bulletin and Peabce combined
to commit this offence is not stated, but in
a happy Sunday-school spirit, which is
blissfully careless alike of fact and reason-
able deduction, “Brother John” pens the
following homily :—-
National safety and prosperity depend altogether
upon honest industry and friendly relations with
other Powers. There never will be war between
England and Germany for the same reason that
there will never be another war between America
or Scotland or South Africa and England; because
commercial and social ties are so strong between
the two countries. The world is so small nowa-
days, what with aeroplanes, wireless and fast ocean
travel, that the ignorance which makes wars has
almost disappeared. It does exist, true, but amongst
petty nations, and their actions are considered as
annoying and troublesome as a street fight.
Just so ! And the nations which are petty
in point of their importance to the civilised
world, but gigantic in potentiality from the
merely military standpoint, are the very
ones which are likely to threaten Australia
and the national ideals for which we as a
people stand. The Balkan trouble, from a
world view-point, is hardly even a street
fight; it is merely a dog-fight in the back-
yard. Yet the great civilised Powers can-
not stop it, and dare not interfere with it
beyond a certain point. The forces with
which Australia may have to contend have
much less idea of those alleged civilising
influences which are supposed to make war
impossible than any people of the Balkans.
Even old Turkey is curbed by at least a pre-
tence of altruistic principles, but Asia in
the mass knows nothing of them. From an
advanced European standpoint, the Asiatic
is a highly-cultured savage. Under his
veneer of civilisation he follows the primal
law that “he may take who has the power,
and he may keep who can.” We know, and
are assured of this, because we have seen
him put it into practice. “Brother John”
may mean well, or he may not, but the one
essential fact that he has not learned is
that the peoples of Asia have not been to
Sunday school, and even if they could be
persuaded to go, would not hold to the tenets
of Sunday school a moment longer than it
suited their very natural and very primitive
desires. On the plain face of things, peace
is best attained through preparation for war
or for anything else that may come along.
Those who advocate a Commonwealth citi-
zen army are on the side of peace, and their
opponents, in spite of all Sunday-school
talk about the natural good intentions of the
person with the axe, are directly conniving
at war in its most injurious form.
A Tip for Toryism.
“H. Singemoine” as Strategist: —
One of the baffling features of present-day politics
in N. S. Wales is Liberalism’s hostility to the idea
of a third party. At least, the phenomenon would
be baffling did one not bear in mind that Liberalism
of the more crusted sort invariably begins by oppos-
ing every new development as a matter of course,
and as a result often fights hard against its own best
interests. That the cause of Conservatism—and the
Liberal party in Australia is fully two-thirds Con-
servative—will be best served by a third party and
a fourth and a fifth party in every Parliament in the
land, is one of the most easily demonstrable of propo-
sitions. The nominal aim of the whole Liberal
party, and the very real aim of the more Tory sec-
tion of it, is anti-Socialism. Under existing condi-
tions the anti-Socialist stands to get dashed little
of the doctrine he loves from either of the two
opposing parties. If anything, Toryism is on a
better wicket under the regime of a Labor Govern-
ment of the McGowen type than when a Liberal
administration is in the field.
Let it be granted, as a preliminary, that the main
object of all Governments is to stay m office, lo
do that they must steadily keep acquiring support.
The straight-out Liberal vote a nominally Tory ad-
ministration can always depend on that is, the
“class” vote. So we find one Liberal administration
after another chasing the coy Labor elector with
its hands filled to overflowing with Socialism. Wade
gave, or tried to. give, N. S. Wales more Socialism
in anv one year than McGowen has done in two.
Ills Land Bill, against which the gentle Onslow
being a city and suburban property-owner, uprose
in wild revolt, and which was flung out with con-
tumely by the Legislative Council, was such a
measure as Ke!R Hardie or Ben Tillett might have
fathered. And Wade never made the shadow of a
pretence of an effort to remove anv of e . f ocl f al t
which is alreadv in existence. The tactics of the
McGowen Government are, for fairly obvious reasons,
altogether different. Tt has pandered to ' ,
in a dozen different directions. The mishandling of
the defunct Gas Bill, .and the sensational borrowing
feats, are cases in point. Yet they cou £
entire animal in the matter of Toryism, since the
modern Labor voter is liable to get restive if his leg
is wrenched too hard. So things are painfully un-
satisfactory for the genuine Liberal (who as afore-
mentioned is, for the most part, a genuine Tory)
whichever party is in the limelight.
• he needs, and what, if he were not a short-
sighted fool in political matters, he would lay himself
out, to get, is a compact, well-disciplined party,
pledged to represent his views, and none other. It
would be no bogus anti-Socialist organisation, but
a tireless advocate of the Real Thing. It would
clamor for the de-nationalisation of the trains, trams,
lunatic asylums, gaols and public services; the re-
moval of all subsidies from hospitals, schools of arts,
A., H. and P. Shows, etc. ; the abolition of old age
pensions, factory and shops legislation, and all the
machinery of the State’s Industrial Courts and of its
grossly Socialistic education system. Its ultimate
aim would be the destruction of the universal-
suffrage principle, and a harking back to the old
property qualification. Every fresh proposal of a
democratic character would be sternly fought by the
new body, which might call itself the Imperial, or
the Right, Thinking, or the Intellectual party, or
something' non-committal like that. What a tre-
mendous lot can be achieved by a small party, pro-
vided it is united and in earnest, is evidenced by
the success of the Nationalists in the House of
Commons. They appear to be on the brink of gain-
ing that which has for years been regarded all over
the Empire as an unthinkable change and a danger-
ous revolution. Anti-Socialism’s only real hope lies
in getting busy along similar lines. Of course con-
vinced. anti-Sociab'sts can go on supporting riotouslv
Socialistic Liberal administrations, and pretending
that the latter are not what they palpably are. But
this sort of game is bound to grow boresome after
a while. There is nothing more trying than make-
believe where the serious facts of life are con-
cerned.

A Chance for Home Rule.
The Home Rule Bill has gone to the House
of Lords, where, unless the noble persons
who still have it in their power to hold up
legislation show a complete change of front,
the measure will be rejected. Then, by the Par-
liament Bill’s provisions, the thing must be
brought up again in the Commons, passed
again without alteration, again presented to
the Peers, again rejected, and again passed
by the Lower Chamber before it can become
law in spite of hereditary legislators. The
process is roundabout, and there are any
number of dangers still in the path of the
big reform. Everything depends upon the
Asquith party hanging together with the
tenacity of bull-dogs and the enthusiasm of
fanatics until the cumbrous machine gets
through with its job. But, meantime, the Gov-
ernment has lots of other fish to fry, and
some of it is scaly and only moderately
wholesome fish. Any party division over
other matters may affect seriously the Home
Rule majority, which must somehow or other
be maintained until the thing is seen
through. The Opposition crowd is perfectly
aware of this fact, and will do all that lies
in its power to promote discord among the
Liberals. Moreover, there is the Labor
party to consider, and the big question of
tariff reform may suddenly fill the whole
political field; or war may break out and
shake political parties as nothing else can
shake them. So the time to shout about
the passing of the Home Rule Bill is not
yet. The most that can be said is that now
for the first time there is a real chance of
the measure becoming law. Had there been
no party government in England the measure
would probably have been carried 20 years
ago. Also, had there been no party govern-
ment in England a century ago. there would
never have been an Act of Union, or a
Castlereagh mission to buy Irish votes, or
anv of the things which have gone to make
English politics the stagnant bog they have
become, or Ireland the land of weary waiting
for the opportunities which have never ar-
rived.
The Red Plague.
A CORRESPONDENT (B. 9/1/T3), comment-
ing on a recent “Plain English.’’ says that
“education and free treatment of (venereal)
disease without compulsion seem to be the
most hopeful means of minimising the
trouble.” If that correspondent will inquire
of the Imperial naval authorities in Sydney
(a port described not so very long ago by
the then Admiral of the Australian station
in this regard as “Darkest Sydney ) he
will learn that one of the most foul, curse-
distributing, and far-reaching diseases has
been reduced encouragingly since the In-
oners’ Detention Act came into operation.
By this measure diseased persons impris-
oned (except for non-payment of fines) may
be detained for curative purposes after then-
sentence has been served, Act came
into operation on January 1, IdUy. in
April of that year, Admiral Poore made a
few unpleasant remarks concerning ven-
ereal disease in the Australian section ot
the British fleet; but in August, eight
months after new powers had been availed
0 f—compulsion superseding the old volun-
tary methods—the Admiral drew special
attention to a report of Fleet-Surgeon V.
G. Thorpe, of the Powerful, and said :
From this report it appears. that the legislation
introduced by the N. S. Wales Government has had
a verv beneficial effect in reducing the number ot
cases of venereal disease in H.M. ships in Sydney.
The operations of a few months are cer-
tainly not much to base a definite opinion
upon; but more followed. Last May, the
present Admiral of the Australian station,
in an expressed desire to further the argu-
ments of those favoring compulsory treat-
ment of diseased persons, forwarded ex-
tracts to the N. S. Wales Controller-Gen-
eral of Prisons from the Statistical Report
of the Health of the Navy, for the year
1910, as follows: —
(1) Australia shows 103.27 (i.e., ratio per 1000),
a still further reduction (in venereal disease) as
compared with 1909, and it suggests that the
legislative action referred to in 1909 has, at least,
nlaved a part in this improvement.
P (2) Three hundred and forty-five cases are recorded
(in 1910), with four invalidinvs, showing a still
further decrease as compared with 1909, , an,da fall
in the case rate of no less than 63.19 per 1000, as
compared with the average for the P«tjtow i five
years The legislative action in N. S. Wales would
appear in view of the marked decrease during the
past two years, to have contributed to this result.
Admiral King-Hall himself declares that
the Prisoners’ Detention Act has un-
doubtedly done much good since it came
into operation.” The shameful thing, of
course, is that, so long as a person does not
commit any other crime, there .is no
authority entitled to take charge of him (and
her) and compel lum (likewise her) to
undergo treatment, no matter how busy the
tainted one may be at the ghastly work
of spreading the horror.
The Misfortune of Being Thompson.
The latest amazing performance of the
Melbourne detective police was the arrest
of one Harold Thompson on suspicion of
being the murderer of Macßobertson’s
commercial traveller. The arrest was made
on the evidence of “a photograph of finger-
prints, very blurred and indistinct.” This
photo, being sent to the Adelaide police by
the official finger-print collector in Mel-
bourne, was found to indicate that one
among many people who left finger marks
on the murdered man’s window-sill might
possibly have been Thompson. Three years
ago he was convicted in Adelaide of having
participated in an assault on a policeman;
hence his print record at the Adelaide
bureau. There was positively no visible
evidence, save the photo of those blurred
and indistinct prints, to justify the man’s
arrest, whereas the only evidence as to the
personality of the murderer gave the police
no encouragement to expect that he would
be convicted even if he were arrested. Note
the description which the murdered man’s
widow gave to the police:—
The taller of the two men was about sft. 6in.
high, of slight build, but fairly well made. He wore
a green-striped suit. . . .The other man was about sft.
4in. high and of a similar build. The voice of the
first man was that of a youth just emerging into
manhood.
Thompson doesn’t answer to this descrip-
tion in any particular. He is not at all
boyish-looking. He is about sft. Bin., heav-
ily built and of considerable physical de-
velopment. His voice is by no means
young. He says that he is 34 years of age
and a laborer. From Adelaide he was de-
scribed as “a man of powerful physique,
with the reputation of possessing ‘a terri-
ble punch.’ ” The Melbourne detectives,
having arrested the somewhat shady char-
acter in a melodramatic manner, at the
shady house where they knew him to be
quartered, were bound to take him to the
widow Trotter for identification. And it
goes without saying that she, who had
described her husband’s murderer and his
accomplice as a pair of slender young men,
or youths, could not possibly recognise
either of them in thick-set Thompson, the
34-year-old strong man with a “terrible
punch.” The police, nevertheless, declined
to tell the newspapers at once whether Mrs.
Trotter would swear to the prisoner or no.
All they could tell the press, apart from the
blurred and indistinct finger-print story, was
that they had captured four cartridges of the
same calibre as the one that killed Trotter,
on a shelf in Thompson’s bedroom —a very
unlikely place for him to leave such cart-
ridges if he had felt any fear of being
arrested for the murder of Trotter. On
the strength of the photo of some blurred
finger prints the Melbourne police seized
this well-known character, although they
already knew him to be utterly unlike Mrs.
Trotter’s description of either of the two
burglars. Having seized him, they searched
his room, and found those four cartridges,
whereupon they suspected that the guilty
things had b.een extracted from the weapon
that killed Trotter ; so they decided to
“obtain the opinion of an expert as to
whether the cartridges had ever been inside
the chambers of a revolver” —as though any
expert opinion on such a question could be
worth twopence as evidence against an
alleged murderer ! The obvious weakness of
the excuse for pulling Thompson out of bed
and pushing him into prison arouses the un-
pleasant suspicion that the police had a
grudge against the man. And a reason for
a grudge is suggested in the fact that
Thompson was arrested in Westralia some
months ago on a Melbourne charge of
assault and robbery, and, after being brought
all the way from W.A. to answer the
charge, put the police to confusion by get-
ting acquitted.
A Sorely-handicapped Business.
The plaint of an habitual eater: —
In the last few months, at least two of the Sydney
restaurants which aim at providing high-class cook-
ing have hoisted signals of financial distress. In the
case of one, which appeared to be going strong until
the tornado of insolvency struck it full amidships
and exposed the utter rottenness of its construction,
flares were shown and rockets sent up, and an official
assignee clambered aboard and took the helm amid
wild scenes of trade horror and commercial confusion.
Let the case of this last concern point the moral of
the following tale. Sydney is one of the world s
great cities. It is enormously rich. Its inhabitants,
if one may judge by their enthusiastic patronage of
theatres, music-halls, boxing contests, surf beaches,
race meetings, picture shows, circuses, etc., are a
pleasure-loving lot. By reason of its situation it is
cosmopolitan, with a big stream of affluent foreigners
continually passing through it. Yet it has not, and
never has had, a restaurant of the class of (say)
the Poodle Dog, in San Francisco, or Romano s, in
London—much less one of the very highest order,
a classic feeding-place such as Joseph s (Pans),
and Willis's (London) were in their palmy
days. What is the explanation of this anomalous
state of affairs? Why should Sydney, which is able
to dress itself like London, house itself like Berlin,
and sport as many motor-cars and diamonds as the
next big town, be condemned for life to feed after
the fashion of Peebles (N. 8.) ? One explanation is
the demented condition of the N. S. Wales licensing
laws. It is practically impossible for a citizen who
decides to blossom out as a restaurateur to. get. a
wine and spirit license. Of course it is possible for
him to buy an hotel, with a license already on the
premises; but (1) he may lack the necessary capital,
(2) the only available pubs may be situated out of
the restaurant zone, and (3) the man who achieves
a pub in Sydney rapidly discovers that the bar trade
is so profitable that he has little need to waste his
time and energy over the high-class catering problem.
The latest purveyor of decent food to hit the rocks
had his establishment crowded at meal-times. His
trouble lay in the fact that, broadly speaking, the
more customers he had the more cash he dropped.
Unless the patron was a person with a ruined
appetite, or no teeth, or a blighted digestion,
there was no profit in him. Had the right
to sell drinks marched with the right to pro-
vide food, this particular tragedy might have been
averted The public would have been better served
both in the matter of despatch (the unprofitable farce
of “sending out” for liquor is an appalling time-
wasterj and in the matter of viands. And no damage
whatever would have been done to the cause of public
moralitv. If Sydney wishes to rise out of the mire
of provincialism in which it is wallowing, with ap-
parent unconsciousness, it will have to rid itself of a
number of Wowserish notions —among them the anti-
drink-license prejudice that has made Maoriland the
worst-pubbed segment of God's green earth. There
is something unfinished, not to say discreditable,
about the appearance of a great city without so much
as one first-rate restaurant. It suggests, to the
travelled eye, a perfectly frocked and booted woman
in a battered mid-Victorian bonnet, or a pretentious
mansion with jam tins on the drive and goats on the
lawn.
For the sea defence of Australia £4,274,000
has been provided for war vessels built,
building, or to be built. This amounts to
£579,000 more than was estimated at the
Imperial Defence Conference of 1909. In-
dividual costs of the unit run out thus:
Armored cruiser Australia, £2,000,000 ; 2nd
class protected cruiser Brisbane, £600,000;
ditto, Sydney and Melbourne, £450,000
each; torpedo boat destroyer Warrego,
£IOI,OOO (which includes £28,000 freight
and cost of re-erection in N. S. Wales) ;
ditto, Parramatta and Yarra, £81,500;
three more torpedo boat destroyers and two
submarines, £510,000. On land defence the
Minister had in hand £1,603,880 for expen-
diture during the year 1912-13, which is an
increase of £431,009 over the amount spent
in 1911-12. Comparing the entire defence
expenditure of 1911-12 (£1,711,167) with
the proposed expenditure during 1912-18
(£2,572,400), an increase of £801,238
is shown. Reckoning the population of
Australia at 5,000,000, the total amount
runs into about 10s. 6d. per head towards
insuring the nation’s life, honor, purity and
property.
There are two ends to the Northern Terri-
tory problem, and neither of them is par-
ticularly satisfactory. At the northern end,
where officialdom reigns Gilruthlessly, the
estimated expenditure for the current finan-
cial year is £478,857. Deduct an estimated
revenue of £47,000, and there remains an
impressive deficit of £431,857. This load
falls on the South, which in the end settles
up more or less with the anxious Hebrew
piper. The northern immigration policy—if
there is such a thing—is alleged to aim at
nothing more splendid than the transference
of a few southern taxpayers to some blocks
on the Daly River. The land-hungry stran-
ger is not being pursued with any enthusi-
asm. So much for the northern end. Down
south the rail-head is located in the same old
place, and things are standing still in a
cheap, paralytic fashion, while the money
fairly blazes under the personal supervision
of Administrator Gilruth, who hurries
about the wilderness in a motor-car, and is
called “Excellency,” and has a beautiful
verandah filled with pot plants. Couldn’t
the Territory be run on plain lines for a
few years until the transcontinental is
pushed north and makes the place really fit
for a cocked hat to buzz in? The sort of
men who roam about a wilderness are
always liable to call the most exalted per-
sonage “Boss,” and to mistake a cocked hat
for the advance guard of a circus. An
“Excellency” should always be supported by
a railway.

From: The Bulletin’s Stipendiary Cor-
poral :
The Balkan position grows interesting. The Allies
have failed to bluff the Turk into yielding up the
fortresses of Adrianople, Scutari and Janina ; on the
other hand, the Turk has got the breathing time
he required. There was a whole week when the Bul-
garian army might have marched into Constanti-
nople, but didn’t. Now the lines of Chatalja have
been enormously strengthened, and a series of works
constructed behind them, and mounted with heavier
guns that the Turks have hitherto used. The strip of
country between Constantinople and Chatalja has
been turned into one huge fortress, in which over
270,000 revenge-hungry Turks await the onset of the
Allies. If the Turk at Chatalja is as good a man as
the Turk at Adrianople, Scutari or Janina, the Allied
army will dash itself to pieces against Chatalja if it
is foolish enough to make the attack. Further, the
Sea of Marmora has been strewn with mines to ward
off an attack by the Greek fleet should the Dardanelles
be forced, so the only way to take Constantinople is
to land an army in Asia Minor and march on Scu-
tari. The outlook of the Allies is thus and otherwise
far from gay. The Servians have roused the Albani-
ans to rebellion, and that part of the peninsula has
declared its independence and war against Servia.
Bulgarian and Servian atrocities in Salonika made
the mass of the people sigh for the horrors of Turkish
rule; Roumania is threatening in the north; the
money is running out, and Bulgaria and Servia are
physically exhausted. Practically every able-bodied
man and boy in both countries is under arms; the
agriculture of the principalities has gone to the dogs ;
so that if the war lasts much longer they will be com-
pelled to import food. What the end will be is hard,
indeed, to guess.

“Vergniaud” has a better idea than most:
If the figure-head of Australia is going to be
permanently excluded from Sydpey Government
House, why not create there for the 'Sydney youngster
a great, healthy, up-to-date public school, such as this
city needs and hasn’t got ? The greatest school in
Australia is the Fort-street. But the existing Fort-
street buildings are a disgrace. So is the locality,
which is all Old Sydney. It is a place of prehistoric
dwellings, an aggregation of dusty, grimy walls and
chimney-pots, and uninviting lanes that run the whole
gamut of aromas. The school is old, badly lighted,
badly ventilated, and badly overcrowded. Some of
the classes pursue their studies in old sheds; others
wrestle with Latin and French in the shelter of flg-
trees (this sounds Arcadian, but it’s merely dusty).
A thousand boys are allowed to attend, and probably
as many girls. The same number seek to enter every
year, but the accommodation won’t stand it. The
fact that every teacher at Fort-street is a specialist
is the attraction. No school in Australia can com-
pare with the old rookery on “The Rocks,” if one
may judge by examination results. And education
there is free. Providentially the majority of Fort-
street pupils don’t reside in the vicinity; they are
healthy, brainy youngsters who go forth each after-
noon to the fresh air of suburban homes. That, and
the fact that the school authorities insist on system-
atic recreation, accounts for the iuvenile mind being
able to flourish in such a disniritmg region.
Years ago, the Huns who picked out sites for our
city and suburban schools, worked on the assump-
tion that any old spot was good enough for a gaol-
like edifice wherein the growing Australian might
have a little information whacked into him. Con-
sequently the schools, many of them erected when
land was quite cheap, have no plavgrounds. They
have a habit of nestling near dirtv lanes and chim-
ney-pots ; they sedulously avoid the parks and the
water frontages; they blushinglv hide themselves ir,
hollows and alongs’de smokv, smelly factories. An
immense part of suburban Sydney straggles along a
water frontage, but rarely do we find a State school
situated where its pupils may obtain a peep at the
Harbor beauties.
Let us leave off being Huns. The citv must have
a big, central, up-to-date high school, and there is
no other site so good as within these grounds. The
public won’t miss the necessary I 0 acres. Probably
some maniacs w : ll howl at the sacrilege, and the
Empire roav momentarily totter as some youth
m-opels a football across a spot where the reverent
’F.nley mused Imperially in years agone. But it won’t
matter. In fact, when the home-coming Australian
turns to the inquiring new-ehum as the liner creeps
up the Harbor, and savs: “Yes. those are a few of
Our Cruisers, and that magnificent edifice in the
beautiful grounds is one of Our Schools,” he will
actually be proud of it.

Here is a field for Government activity that may
be sifelv exoloited without interfering with anv
vested interest. During the month of December
the receipts from Sydney trams were £158,000.
Under the present lax system of collecting fares,
fully 10 per cent, of tram passengers travel free.

With a system of monthly sweeps on the tickets
issued, the loss of revenue due to this cause would
ynd ; the prospect of a possible fortune, dependent on
merely a penny tram ticket, would cause passengers
to insist on receiving the scrip, and this simple and
automatic rise in revenue would, on the basis of 10
per cent, on the December receipts, provide £16,000
for distribution amongst the passengers during that
month.
In addition to this there would be an immediate
advance in the receipts arising from the great in-
crease in traffic due to the temptation to ride rather
than walk. This upward bound in receipts may
safely be estimated anywhere from 25 to 50 per
cent. That the Government needs money is pain-
fully evident. Here is a simple device to raise it
without additional taxation or the disagreeable ex-
pedient of a forced loan on a reluctant market.
No need then, either, for the nresent drastic regu-
lations tending to penalise heedless ticket droppers.
With every man his own collector, the paper would
be carefully gathered. We would have a city freed
from the present litter.
Our series of tickets are ready numbered as if
waiting only the guiding hand of the sweep pro-
moter. We would certainly need a few experts for
organising and perfecting a simnle and satisfactory
svstem. This would mean a further batch of lucra-
tive positions at the disposal of the Government,
with the resulting patronage and consequent sup-
port. The appointment of a new Minister holding
the portfolio of Sweeos might be considered. This
might rope in the Independent party.
These few suggestions are merely tentative, and
are submitted with all humility. They touch but
the fringe of a question of wide and general interest.
That usefid and, to thousands of people,
absolutely necesssary publication, Sands’
Sydney, Suburban and Country Commercial
Directory, reaches its biggest bulk with this
year’s issue. Since the 1912 edition was
published, the compilers have found it neces-
sary to add over 100 pages, and the volumin-
ous work is claimed to be as complete and
reliable as it is possible to make it. After
58 years’ experience of preparing the Direc-
tory, this claim of John Sands, Ltd., may be
allowed, with costs on the usual scale.

Mr. Macarthur announced, with par-
donable pride, last week, that all sections of
the community had poured their contribu-
tions in. The thrippennies of the working-
man loyalist are there, no less than the fat
cheques of the affluent. But, as a result of
shocking casualness on the part of someone,
the donations are not being acknowledged
day by day or even week by week. This
should be rectified, on Imperial and every
other kind of grounds. Failing the full-
est publicity, the cynical and the disbeliev-
ing will be liable to say that the McLinen-
Henley agitation has fallen flatter than

W. I). Johnson, Minister for Public
Works in the Westralian Government, has
been visiting his native Maoriland, and
while there took the opportunity to point
out the awful results of Sosh when it
launched itself upon the sea. Westraliawas
driven to a line of State steamers by its
Beef Trust, and here goes Johnson :—-
When the State steamers and the retail butchery
establishments started in Perth, down came the price
of beef by 2d. per lb. We are running all our ships
a t a profit, both on the balance-sheet and from the
standpoint of the people’s convenience. From the
Commonwealth the line has received a £5OOO mail
contract, and the new steamer, the Eucla, will en-
gage in a mail service contributed to by Common-
wealth and State, worth, I believe, £3500 or £4OOO.
’i et, instead of being disheartened by this
and by the haunting knowledge that the ex-
periment has largely removed the smaller
raisers of cattle from the iniquities of the
Trust, Westralia has the nerve to propose
the addition of more steamers to the Sosh
fleet.
A deputation recently waited on John-
son, Chief Railway Commissioner of
N.S.W., to ask that by a system of in-
creased minimum fares or some other de-
vice the trams to the farther-out eastern
suburbs might be so run that the citizens
living there could get home in time for bed.
if not actually for tea. Johnson, after
making some remarks about the use of the
English language, in which he was wrong,
and urging his employers not to waste time,
told them that for several reasons he
couldn’t grant their request. The chief of
these reasons was that profits were mainly
dependent on the penny fares of those living
nearest to the centre, and that these people
must be considered first. This is advocacy
of congestion pure and simple. It means
that in order to make the trams pay John-
son’s department is out to discourage the
spread of the city, and to force people by
(he sheer difficulties of transit to get as
close to their work as possible. The yarn
about the alleged profits means nothing.
The people own the system, or are at least
responsible for the cash to run it, and the
tramway revenue is only money transferred
from the right-hand pocket to the left. So,
brushing that aside, it boils down to this —
if Johnson can’t carry the traffic of the
outer suburbs, he is simply failing to do the
most important part of the job he is paid
for.

For a minute or so, during the perform-
ance of “The Sunshine Girl,” at Her
Majesty’s, on Saturday night, the writer
permitted himself to dream or brood. He
visioned a musical comedy in which the
hero was not a bogus but a real British
toiler of the unskilled variety. Judgment
summonses, writs, cu. sa. orders and insol-
vency notices rained down on him like hail.
In the intervals of such necessary adjuncts
to his job as singing and dancing, he was
driven, in order to keep body and soul to-
gether, to work at coal-heaving or selling
socks, or some other loathly task. His
clothes were necessarily rotten, and his
general appearance was dusty and worried
and unwashed. The virtuous and beautiful
shop-girl whom he loved did not wear silk
stockings and perfectly-made frocks. She
could not run to such luxuries on the 15s.
6d. per week which, as an outcome of the
inalienable law of supply and demand, was
all her services were worth to the firm
which employed her. In her own way she
looked as dowdy and poverty-stricken as her
humble adorer. The indigent but riotously-
dressed young aristocrat who frequented
her counter did not admire her. Far from
it. lie regarded with a vague mingling of
wonder and detestation the grotesque ornate-
ness of her coiffure, and the surplusage of
cheap jewellery which she revelled in; and
her intensely genteel voice and manner gn\o
him the hump. He only patronised her
establishment because it was one of the few
remaining business-places on earth where lie
was still able to get credit. It was here that
he bought—or rather owed for—clothing of
all sorts for the girl he really worshipped.
She belonged to a musical comedy company,
and was the ultimate shriek in the matter
of perfect teeth and feet, unruffled coolness
(physical and mental), and all-round charm.
She had been divorced twice, in the course
of her fevered 40 years of existence, and
was said to have met, professionally, every
process-server in her natal bailiwick of Pim-
lico—indicating an inherent passion for the
Smart Life. The comedian made but one
entrance. He was then arrested, on prima
facie evidence of being an insanitary per-
son, and taken to a police station, where he
was washed and disinfected, what time his
clothes were being burned. At the end of
Act II (which lasted 2| hours) the hero
and heroine were miserably married in a
registry office and a thick fog. as a pre-
liminary to settling down to a life of strenu-
ous poverty in a two-room flat in the Mile
End Road.
Why doesn’t someone with a passion for
realism stage a musical comedy on those
veracious lines .' Probably because the audi-
ence would be liable, in its annoyance, to
wreck the theatre, and do a mischief to the
players. The people who go over and over
again to shows like the “Sunshine Girl” re-
semble children. They love to be told fairy-
tales wherein everything goes well, and they
don t mind how oftpn the same wild improba-
bility is retailed. The handsome young man
with the baritone voice is alwavs first loved
for his own. joyous, well-fed self, and then
discovered to be a millionaire. Tn turf par-
lance, he gets it both ways. The faithful
maiden, who lias rebuffed dissolute persons
of title on his account, is splendidly re-
warded for her incredible constancy. " The
comedian is rewarded also —possibly for his
heroic dirtiness or energy or something.
The people of rank pull themselves together
and decide to get respectably married. All
is joy and edification. When it is mentioned
that the millionaire hero of “The Sunshine
Girl” is first discovered working incognito
in a soap factory, that the name of his
friend and accomplice is Lord Bicester, and
that the comedian who associates himself
with their demented schemes is a cabman,
enough has been said as regards the plot.
The habitual playgoer will be able to piece
the rest, together for himself. The Ivrics
are particularly well done and the music is
bright. Some of the vaudeville turns are
boresomely long. For example, the foolish
and unalluring political ballet.
Everyone is his or her old self except
Jack Cannot, who, as Floot, the cabman,
easily surpasses his previous efforts.
A gracious feature of this genuine
humorist’s business is that he gets his
laughs without tearing them down by main
force from the gallery, so to speak. Miss
Blanche Browne, Leslie Holland and Frank
Greene are as pleasing and thoroughly effi-
cient as usual. Miss Grace Palotta dresses her
colleagues right off the stage, also as usual.
Her laughing song is one of the successes of
the piece. Miss Jessie Lonnen exploits her
cheery personality for all it is worth, and
dances like the artist she is. Miss Billie
Barlow is an uproarious success, and Miss
Ivy Bickford’s one song is greeted with
shrieks of approval. The rest of the per-
formers are good, and the scenery is superb.

“Milestones,” at Sydney Criterion, seems
booked for a record run. Despite the
construction of the play, which re-
quires in the second and third acts
as much exposition as suffices for the
first act in every other play, thus leaving
little space for action, and despite that the
same situation recurring in each act leaves
little opportunity for dramatic surprise, the
play, by sheer human charm, aided by the
curiosity felt in watching the evolution of
fashions, continues to attract big audiences.
“Milestones” is really a slightly-connected
series of three one-act plays.
On Friday night Allen Doone will un-
frock “The Parish Priest,” and on the fol-
lowing evening “In Old Donegal” will be
produced at the Palace (Sydney). Donegal
is a province of Ireland, but Doone’s lead-
ing lady will endeavor by her accent to raise
suspicions that it is a candy store in Noo
York.

If “The Monk and the Woman” had been
receiving its present gratuitous Sydney boom
in London, say, 150 years ago, that is how
ye George Marlow of the time might courte-
ously have thanked the reverend and lay
boomsters. But in this year of our Lord,
he, no doubt, merely remarks casually to his
manager, “They’re giying her a good gee-up
all right, and doesn’r-even shower a blessing
on his press agent. Such is the casual spirit
ot the age.. The piece will fill the bill at
the Adelphi for a while yet.

I he livoli this week gets together a
presentable programme. The Patty Frank
troupe of tumblers are the latest additions.
I he team comprises five adults and two
boys, and as usual the youngsters are the
most popular. The turn is a tidied-up
edition of many that have gone before, and
more that will come after. The other ’new-
comers, the Musical Sheppards, break no
new ice; the zylophone and its variati >ns
have been coming with a rush lately, and
the writer is looking forward with hope to
a revival of the mouth-organ or the Jew’s
harp by way of change. My Fancy has
added some new dances; Claire Romaine
still breaks all known suffragette rules by
advertising Man; Florence Baines laughs
and grows no leaner; and Alexander Prince
squeezes melodious noises out of his concer-
tina. On Saturday there will be an ava-
lanche of newcomers, including Staley and
Birbeck, reputed musicians; the acrobatic
Maxine Bros, and their dog, and the Lan-
cashire Opera Co.

cupy the bridge, with John Fuller and Jack
Shields (wag) on the hurricane deck, and
Fred Buchanan and Louie Duggan in the
saloon. There are several more artists who
are, metaphorically speaking, in the lower
bowels of the hold, and a couple who deserve
to be lashed to the keel of the famous Castle-
reagh-street vaudeville craft, and left there.

The film production of “Oliver Twist,” at
the Crystal Palace, is not likely to cause
Charles Dickens to either turn in his grave,
or rise up and give three cheers for himself.
Naturally, a lot of the story has had to be
cut out to make it fit, but the framework is
there, with plenty of pathos hanging to it.
In fact, the unfriendly carryings-on of Bill
Sikes towards Oliver and Nancy are rather
overdone. And Fagin the Jew might be bet-
ter.
The Lyceum shows the second of the
“What Happened to Mary” series, wherein
Mary becomes typist; also, and more attrac-
tive, there is a further batch of kinemaeolor
films, including the inevitable reviews of
troops by the King and Kaiser, and studies
of other gay birds and weird animals. The
process is still new enough to provoke the
loud “Oh!” of gratified surprise; though
when it comes to flower studies, the audience
begins to here and there suspect that either
the machine can depart a color-tone or two
from the truth, or the blooms themselves pul
on a special coat of paint before they posed
for their picture.
“My .Tack,” revived at the King’s on Sat-
urday, dates back to the time when British
bellowdramas were rather longer-winded
than the modern get-mad-quick sort, and the
tone of the dialogue was apt to be more
reasonable than the situations. “My .Tack”
is an odd specimen of the antique. It intro-
duces the unnecessary pathos and bathos of
a blind mother and an erring son. the lady
with the fixed stare and outstretched hands
being wholly irrelevant, whereas the wan-
dering boy (who is always dead and buried
as far as she knows) serves as the subject
for a murder that really doesn’t matter to
the story. The nominal heroine (Miss Dug-
gan) cuts no figure to speak of except when
she goes to the rescue of a wrecked vessel on
an angry sea which has no apnarent cause
for its emotion, and the British Flag is
merely dragged in to divert attention from
the real business in hand. The mysterious
papers that Panitzer Harrison carries about
in a waterproof parcel are the whole busi-
ness. The acting of the Anderson eo. —

This week there was another rare occa-
sional matinee of “Antony and Cleopatra."
at the Royal. Before the final curtain falls
on the corpse-strewn scene of Asche’s pre-
sent production, there will be at least one
more matinee, presumably. The last of
Antony’s gaudy nights is not yet mentioned
in the advts. Melbourne has decided that
the big show is a thing to be seen, and the
number of people who invariably see what
they are told to see, but never rush to meet
the obligation, is so large that the Last Per-
formances had better make an early start.
The panto, continues to score eight
notches per week, and the curtain is still
rising at 7.40 or 1.40 p.m. Also, the
name-part is played by a Puss impersonator
who wears Boots as before.
Next Saturday (d.v.) the whirling Arabs
will be added to the bill at the Opera House,
but, meanwhile, the mysteries of l)e Biere
are h powerful attraction. Other wizards
have done much the same things, or quite
the same things, as the little man in knee
breeches (even the tied-thumbs trick is not
new to mankind), so the popularity of De
Biere appears to be due to the manner of
his magic rather than to the matter of it.
Kitchen and Foy, a pair of humorists on
horizontal bars, who were formerly funny
in Wirths’ Circus, have lately come to sup-
ply a want at the Opera House ; and Miss
Renee, who arrived a w r eek earlier, has re-
mained to be generally admired.
To-morrow (Friday) sees the last of “The
Bad Girl of the Family” at the Princess’s.
The bill announced for Saturday sounds very
like an explanation of how even Good Girls
take the Wrong Turning, and get left with-
out a Home. It is entitled “No Mother to
Guide ller,”and will appeal to widowers and
orphans for the first time in Australia.
People who expected to see in “Oliver
Twist,” at the P’ran Lyric (Vic.) last week,
something informative about a new brand of
tobacco were disappointed to learn that the
picture related a story by a young writer
named Dickens. The yarn was of a shock-
ingly pathetic and tragic character, but was
so well told that this paper is ready to pro-
phesy a great future for the author, who has
evidently been influenced by Charles Gar-
vice and General Booth. A narrative of
claim-jumping, with interludes of gun-pla.v,
was screened in “ ‘Death Valley’ Scotty’s
Mine”; and “Heredity” revealed a Squaw-
man drama with a very convincing death
sensation. “Monte Cristo” is running this
week, and is accompanied by special operatic
selections during the gallop.

AS A LYDY.
West’s, in Melbourne, has been the refuge
of “The Mills of God,” which ground out a
furtive tale of incendiarism, assault and
other violence. Lorenzo, “a tiend incar-
nate,” is the principal apparition, and his
persecution of Maria and her hubby, whom
he drives to poverty and a low diet, is not
less harrowing than his own conclusion in
the bowels of a burning building. “The
Voice of Conscience” spoke with a still
small piping in an Amurkan effort, wherein
a young man is wrongfully accused of slay-
ing his prospective pa-in-law ; while the only
obvious thing about “The Masquerade Ball”
was the probably righteous argument that a
really vain woman is bereft of moral sense.
The best subject on West’s programme, how-
ever, was Nap. Bonaparte’s retreat from
Moscow, staged with real snow and the
assistance of the Russian army.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“T. 0.1.”: Barry Sullivan was the boy to knock off
the action of a play, and “give it to ’em.” Once he
stopped in the middle of an act, and stepping to the
front said: “M’hat do you want? I have not come
to Australia to make a name—l have brought it with
me.” MTien the Theatre Royal was under his man-
agement he was strict as to order. I remember one
occasion when a party of fashionables, led by a very
well-known dame —the men included some stray
officers of the 14th Regiment then in Melbourne —-
kept up a running fire of chat and laughter, which
called forth loud cries of “order” from the pit and
stalls. Sullivan, who wasn’t in the play that night,
happened to be in the dress-circle. He strode to the
offenders, and with the ushers’ help bundled the lot
out. On another occasion a snob (they were called
“poodles” in Melbourne then) continued to interrupt.
Sullivan went to him and told him to go to the box-
keeper and get his money, Sullivan leading the way.
The snob kicked the actor. They were then at the
head of the d.-c. stairs. Sullivan turned on his
assailant, and landing him “one on the point,” sent
him spinning down the long flight of steps into
Bourke-street.
“Hullo”: The curious conventions of the Chinese
stage, practically identical with those of the Eliza-
bethan stage, have been made effective use of in a
play on a Chinese subject, which has been an artistic
success in N’York. Present writer once saw a
Chinese play staged at Shanghai, and the remarkable
thing was the dramatic effectiveness of it, despite
(or, as he recognises now, because of) the conven-
tions of Chinese drama. The audience is not worried
by the apparent falsity of stage scenerv, by trees
obviously cut out with a fret saw, and the inevitable
painted back-cloth. The Chinese property-man comes
in and arranges a couple of chairs to represent a
temple or a mountain ; and because the actors were
actors, the audience saw the temple or the mountain.
Present scribe saw in that play the finest caricature
of Ji European he has. ever seen, or ever hopes to see.
the Yellow Jacket," with a characteristic Chinese
theme, achieves its success by deliberately emphasis-
ing these conventions—which, after all, are no worse
than the other conventions we are accustomed to on
the English stage. The black-robed property man
(supposed to be invisible) fixes up his scenerv while
smoking a careless cigarette and looking bored. The
hero and heroine climb on to the chairs and remark
that they are reclining in a flower-boat that is drift-
ing slowly down a river. Two attendants stand be-
chairs and pretend to be boatmen by poling
rhythmically at the air. A musician, in full view of
the audience, scrapes two pieces of sandpaper to-
gether to imitate the swish of the water; and the
fact that the same effect is got in an English play by
the property man s assistant behind the scenes is no
less conventional, because the audience knows that
the bloke is behind the scenes. The result in this
play is that the poetry of the love-scenes is added
to by the very fact that it is able to triumph over the
obvious mechanism. The play is said to be magically
beautiful and poetic.
“The Ratcatcher’s Daughter”: Would anybody who
has seen the kinemacolor films unreeled believe this?
'ljere are only two colors —red and green—used, and
they are projected not from the film, which is plain
black and white like anv other, but from re-
volving shutters of red and green. There are no yel-
lows, no blues, no browns, and when these appear on
the screen they are placed there by the imagination
of the observer. If the pictures were screened very
slowly, instead of very rapidly (as tliev have to be
in order to produce the optical illusion), one would
be all red and the other all green. That’s how' the
Spencer people “took their colonial” to me. But it
doesn’t satisfy me—not by chunks.
The Bedroom Scene in “THE BAD GIRL OF
THE FAMILY,” at Melbourne [?]rubcess's.
“Stargazer”: “Antony and Cleo,” by O. Asche and
W. Shakspegre, is a fine, big, living-picture show. It
is staged With splendor, and painted with regal prodi-
gality, yet succeeds in being nothing really definite
but a display of pageants and a series of admirably
composed pictures right up to Act V., when Cleopatra
elects to die verbosely inside a monument. The play,
as presented, lacks continuity. ~We get spasms of
Antony instead of a consecutive and fluent exposition
of a character. But in that last act emotions are
stirred, humanity rises up and takes hold, and for the
first time the interest is centred in tragedy that is
personal, dynamic, real. To me Antony is occasion-
ally actual, Domitius Grimwood often so; but the
occasion is Cleopatra Bravton’s, and she seizes it,
and is a fine Egyptian indeed. Act V. is practically
all hers, and despite a dangerous prolixity, for which
the joint authors are responsible, she makes it bril-
liant. The rest of the play is worth seeing; the last
act is worth hearing.
“Spasmode” : Phil Finkelstein shows me about a dozen
photos, of Principal Boys who have figured in Mel-
bourne pantomimes. How soon the hobby-horse is
forgot, as the melancholy Dane says ! Principal Boy-
dom is the most fragile thing going. Little Miss
Muffet goes as a fairy kiddy to Stoke Pogis. Ad-
vances to the ballet at Peckham. Gets a line of
speaking part at Leeds. Advances to Principal Girl at
Birmingham. Then, oh, glory! Principal Boy at
Glasgow! Best in the United Kingdom without
doubt. Who’s this Angelina Muffet? Fetch her right
off to Drury Lante! It is Chimborazo! But she
must descend to Mont Blanc, which is Melbourne.
Then wherever does she go to? Where are you, sweet
Iris, charming Meredith Meredro, bewitching Gas-
trelle (I even forget how to spell your name), lovely
Sybil Arundale? But she’s here, the exception that
proves the rule. Make hay while the sun shines, you
Principal Boy! You will be treated with con-
founded unfairness. Thrust aside merely for a new
pair of guaranteed jbranless legs. In short, for
Glorious Youth. Make hay, then. Life has no
second spring.
“0.K.” : The popular colored singing men of yester-
year, full of melody and not lacking in art, have left
no successors, seemingly. The Rickards cos. could
do with a black tenor of the calibre of M'allace King,
whose specialty was “Sally Horner.” He had grown
old ere he came to Australia, and his silvery tenor
had thinned into a falsetto, but his knowledge of how
to sing preserved his ancient voice for some years
after it had gone at the knees. A contemporary was
Will Johnston, the basso profundo. His particular
success was “A Hundred Fathoms Deep,” and when
he got down to his bottom-most note the house for-
gave him for being a crude, graceless nigger, sway-
ing on his feet like the drunk he unhappily was.
Then there was McAdoo, the gentlemanly coon, who
first came to Australia with the Fisk University
Singers, and made enough money out of it to start up
in a big way in the boot business. None of the coons
who happen here nowadays are in the same warbling
class as baritone McAdoo. Has the emancipated nig-
gah lost his vocal punch?
“A. G. Gawler”: Mention of the first theatres in
Adelaide recalls my own memories of the days when,
as a youngster, approaching 50 years ago, I played in
the Victoria Theatre. Few of us are left now. First
among players at the old Vic. was William Hoskins,
Shakspearia-n scholar. What a treat was his Affable
Hawk in “The Game of Speculation” and his Dr.
Pangloss in “The Heir-at-Law,” and his delightful
readings ! One can understand Henry Irving becom-
ing so great an actor with such a tutor. Yet how
unfortunate Hoskins was as a manager! Then poor
Charles Young, a genuine comedian, one of the best,
if not the best, Graves in “Money.” His Wormwood
in “The Lottery Ticket” and his Splash in “The
Young Widow” were fine, too. He was a good friend
and adviser of young actors—so good that we all
mourned his unhappy end. Marie St. Denis, a pupil
of William Hoskins —what a sad fate was hers, too !
She should have died hereafter. Joseph Rayner, one
of the old school, a good melodramatic actor, was
always, I remember, appealing for “more music.”
Not a bad Hamlet, we thought. He had a splendid
wardrobe, of which he was very proud. Louisa
Arnot, (Mrs. Bartine), formerly of the Marsh troupe,
was a good “male impersonator." She had the most
splendid figure on show in those days. Johnny
Edouin and his charming little wife, Tilly Earle,
shone in burlesque, and both were good dancers. Mrs.
Harry Jackson was leading lady and one of the best
Lady Audlevs. Stuart O’Brien was leading man —
very precise in his manner and with a wonderful
memory. And there were poor old Harry Daniels, a
splendid eccentric character delineator; johnny Hall,
a good imitator of Jefferson in “Rip Van Winkle” ;
and Johnny’s clever little wife, Emily Wiseman ; and
dear old Musgrave, one of the best of old men, very
quaint and original; and —but shall we stop?
“Petramos”: Australia is doing very well at the
London 'alls. At the palatial Chiswick Empire, the
wVT • n ’kht, young Clyde Cook, sometime of the
J.C.W. pantos, “went better” than anything jelse
on a bill that did not need the doctor's attention. At
Collins s, Ada Colley’s soprano raised more en-
thusiasm than the rest of the programme. At the
Coloseum “Wild Australia,” including Bonita and
Cleopatra, is a distinct hit, though the back cloth
represents a portion of the Commonwealth evidentlv
selected bv a permanent pessimist. Fred Lindsay,
the Australian stockwhip man, has been a “sensation”
wherever I have seen him. “Madam Colda,” an Aus-
tralian singer at the Hippodrome, gets fervent appre-
ciation, and the little McLeans, who have been doing
well at Putney, are now lifting the festive foot with
success m the provinces. Bert Gilbert insists on his
Australian birth here, and does sketches with Ivv
Ray, an Australian girl; and Jo Blascheck is at the
Queen s Hall as “the Australian humorist.”

regulations posted up in the dressing-rooms of Augus-
tin Dalys N’York Theatre. The Spartan manager,
who evidently knew his beauty actor, insisted, for
instance, that no member was to parade Broadway
at certain hours of the afternoon. No tobacco in any
form was even to pass the stage door. And the
majestic Daly further insisted that no member of his
co^ was to address him without being spoken to first.

two-shows-a-night music halls that they are seri-
thinking of following suit. G. R. Sims ad-
pses them to do so. He says there is a vast public
in London ready for amusement between 6 and 7
p.m. Ihe music-halls now drag in most of that
crowd with their first show, which starts shortly
eilei, Sl * • an i d flnishes at dose-on 9. Sims thinks
tbe theatrical managers should throw their first hook
at b.dO when they would have a good working-
class audience. They should cast the second at nine
when the late-diners would crowd into the circle and
stalls. It may not be a bad idea for the managers,
but it is a blue prospect for actors and actresses,
the music-hall artist can do his turn in 15 min-
utes and then clear out, but unless entirely different
staffs were employed it would be a long day for the
other sort of pro.

Clara Butt has been getting a large, expensive
advt. in London through refusing an offer of £250
a night to sing at the London Palace for a fortnight.
The Palace is the house which was selected bv
George 7 . and Mary for their first varietv “command
performance”; and no doubt if they would hang
the crown out over a box throughout her fortnight’s
engagement, the massive Clara would accept. But.
as things are, she feels that “many of her friends
might not favorably regard her appearance on the
stage of a variety theatre.”
“Avon”: For the information of the “Poverty-
Pointer ” who recently wrote that none of the news-
papers in Australasia had drawn attention to the
poverty of the “book” of “Evervwoman,” let me sav
that the press critics in Christchurch (M.L.), at any
rate, drew attention to it with a club, in a manner
of speaking. The Press hinted at the matter in
these words: “There is no literary distinction what-
ever in the dialogue” : and Lyttelton Times gentlv
remonstrated as follows: “A play of platitudes and
puns of trite sayings and rank journalese cut into
lengths.”
“C. Ocknev”: At what was termed a “Dialect

Graham Moffat, represented the Scottish dialect, and
Australia s old stage favorite, Edmund Gwenn, who

THE POWER OF LOVE AND SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The gods who tickle human brains
With wisps of fine electric straw
To waken such poetic strains
As move to measured cosmic law,
Were rather busy yesternight
When our Catullus Smith got tight.
For often in the cup of wine,
Or other liquid leagued with bliss,
There dwells the fire of song divine
That wakens to the midnight kiss,-
And then our hash-house turrets shake
With lays that keep the cats awake.
Hexameters were Homer’s strength ;
He reeled them off with grace and ease
lines of large tonnage and great length
Devised some kingly drunk to please.
But Smith, when he gets going strong,
Makes his lines short, his raptures long.
La,st night upon thg doorstep cold
Catullus warbled to the moon;
Of loves and wars and death he told
In slabs of modulated tune,
Until his warm poetic fire
Aroused the neighborhood to ire.
It is admitted as a fact
That poesy can raise the mind
And stir the loggard soul to act
In baresark rage untamed and blind;
And baresark rage was all around
That poet person making sound.
The artist is a simple bloke
M r ho scratches lines or daubs for bread,
Who loves the seething world to soak
In seas of orange, puce and red ;
He is the man of simple sin
Who merely takes the landlord in.
But poets, flooded with brown beer
Till all the banks of song o’erflow,
Can move a cab-horse to a tear,
Or cause a maiden aunt to grow
As sentimental as the heart
Of some lorn cabbage of the mart.
That was the reason why we rose,
A phalanx of determined men
With wrathful slippers on our toes,
In ranks of twenty and of ten,
All armed and resolute and strong,
To part the poet and his song.
’Twas vain ; the surging discord raged.
Against its force our charges broke;
Unequal war with sound we waged
Mho only in thin whispers spoke.
We chorussed: “Get to bed, you cow,
M'e’re sick of your infernal row.”
He did not hear ; his soul was deep
Enamored of the rhyming word,
Till one small voice, awaked from sleep,
High o’er us in the darkness stirred.
“Catullus Smith,” it sternly said,
“Take off your boots and come to bed.”
He ceased to sing, and straight uprose,
Obedient to that voice above;
And each of us remarked : “That shows
The fiower of poetry and love,
For only love or death is strong
Enough to deal with serious song!”

SOCIETY
Of course, there is no reason to mistrust
the gentle Mongol —there never was. Still,
the recent burning alive of 39 lepers of
Ivwang-si in a pit full of kerosened wood is
almost enough to suggest that, not because
of his color, but because of his different way
of looking at things. Ah Ping may not be
quite the most desirable brother-in-law in
the world for a white Australian. Inciden-
tally, it might be interesting to know whe-
ther Canon Hues, of Melbourne, sees in the
incident a reason to further rejoice over the
blending of the races.
Elwood Mead, Victoria’s one-armed irri-
gation expert, gave the Science Congress in
Melbourne one of its best papers. He wrote
on “Forest Waste.” The subject hit him
when he was a youngster. Born in the
largest and perhaps most valuable area of
hardwood on earth, he saw the forest dis-
appear like mist. From the Alleghany
Mountains westward to beyond the Missi-
ssippi, nearly a thousand miles, and from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, over 500
miles, there was originally almost unbroken
forest —oak, hickory, ash, walnut, cherry,
maple, beech and poplar, growing to size
and perfection unknown elsewhere. Near
his father’s home there were poplars from
4ft. to 6ft. diameter, and from 50ft. to 100 ft.
to the first limb; and on his grandfather’s
farm was a walnut Tft. in diameter. Yet, in
even Mead’s young time it was all regarded
as an unmitigated evil. Every tree was the
pioneer’s foe; and to get rid of the curse,
settlers had “logging bees.” Now. the
National Government is spending nearly
£20,000,000 sterling in building locks and
weirs on the Ohio, once a great waterway
at all times, but rendered almost unnavi-
gable in summer through lack of forest con-
servation.
In Melbourne Wowserism is winning in
the war on Sunday entertainments. The City
Council has adopted a schedule of the Local
Government Act which makes it. compulsory
for every “building, hall or ground” in
which public amusements are conducted to
be registered with the Council. This gives
the Council power to fix “times and hours”
during which they may be used; and the
plain intention is that they shall be closed
on the Sawbath. This is in face of the re-
cent direct refusal of the Victorian Parlia-
ment to pass a Bill prohibiting Sunday
entertainments; and though Parliament is
not exactly broad based on a people’s fran-
chise, it’s miles ahead of the city muddlers
in that respect. The fond delusion hugged
by the parsons (the only thing parsons do
hug with real passion) is that all the people
who now go to picture shows on Sunday
evening will swell the congregations. The
nude truth is that more of them will either
go mixed-bathing or bunny-hugging.
A fine sample of the sturdy reformer was
before the South Melbourne Court last week.
Because his stepdaughter, a girl of 19, had
come home in a dress which was not to his
taste, he had taken off his belt and clouted
her over the head with the buckle end.
After receiving this dignified reproof, she
was taken away, bleeding freely, to receive
medical attention. To the opportune con-
stable who witnessed the assault and caught
him as he was escaping through the back
gate, the moralist remarked sourly: “I only
gave her one clout with the strap ! It’s
a pity I didn’t finish her!” Two convic-
tions for wife assault and using obscene
language proved that it had not been his
first moral outbreak, and the Bench fined
him £2. The time will yet come when
anyone who uses the buckle end of a belt
with enough fervor to send the victim to a
doctor will be suspected of violence. At
present, the idea seems to be that he is
either merely playful or prayerful.
The Glenelg Railway muddle in Adelaide
has a prospect of having a new face put on
it shortly, Public-Works Butler having been
badgered into a pledge that the rails shall
come out of King William-street south be-
fore next Christmas. What is to be done
when the rails do come out he admittedly
does not know. The State has two Glenelg
lines, built idiotically by competing Private
Enterprise 40 years ago. They are about
400 yards apart most of the way, but branch
out at the city end. The much-used one
enters from the south, and runs, or ambles,
half a mile up the main city street. The
less-used one goes round to swell the jamb
in North Terrace station. If the rails come
out of the street, then nearly every passen-
ger will have to be carted about two-thirds
of 'a mile by trams. Other desperate sug-
gestions are (1) to run all the traffic to
congested North Terrace; and (2) to elec-
trify the whole Glenelg line. If a train is
called a tram, visitors from other States do
not laugh at its running up a street —and
that laugh is really the main cause of the
agitation.
THE SILVER LINING.
Him (at end of argument, optimistically):
“ Well, anyway, I'm glad I’m not a
Mormon."
The Argus fears “physical breakdown’'
for those poor girls who have had a rise to
455. through tlie Clerks’ Wages Board —
breakdown through a sudden excess of over-
work. Many a girl-clerk has suffered “phy-
sical breakdown,” not to mention a few
other things, through trying to live, clothe
herself and go to picture-shows on
15s. a week; and The Bulletin doesn’t re-
member that the Argus has groaned much
about it. This arouses the unkind suspicion
that the old Freetrade lady could put up
with her sister’s breakdown so long as it
happened in the sacred cause of sweating.
The papers read and subjects discussed
before the Science Congress are more like
the stock-in-trade of Young Men’s Debating
Societies than the serious work of leaders
in the realm of scientific investigation. Next
time the Congress meets it might, therefore,
discuss the question: “Is medicine a pro-
fession or a trade?” Scientific opinion on
the subject would be interesting in the light
of the fact that doctors have been charging
half a guinea for signing the maternity
bonus certificates.
THE DIFFERENCE.
JAMES: “When I married her I thought I
would make a different woman of her."
THE LADY: “ You failed?"
JAMES: “Yes, she has only become indifferent."
Sydney owns a remarkable battler in a
little lady who trades as “Madam Bell.”
Years and yeat-s ago, when Statistician
Knibbs was in the N.S.W. service, and had
just been made Director of Technical Edu-
cation, she introduced a dress-cutting system
to the Technical College; and that’s how
the trouble started. There was another
dress-cutting system on the premises, and
the two came into conflict. Of course, Mrs.
Bell says her system is the system ; but that
is a matter that need not be gone into.
However it happened, the lady was pushed
out. Then she began to move around. E.
W. O’Sullivan was the first politician she
successfully button-holed. He seems to have
been satisfied that there was something that
didn’t smell nice about the business, and he
championed the lady. After O’Sullivan.
McGowen and Carmichael were successfully
appealed to. Every year the case of Madam
Bell was mentioned in the House. Fin-
ally, after six years’ battling, the lady got
a select committee. It took a volume of
evidence, some of it throwing black shadows
on the administration of the Technical Edu-
cation Department, and reported entirely in
the lady’s favor. There was every proba-
bility of the report going into a pigeon-hole;
but the lady with the seven-year-old griev-
ance saw to it that that didn’t happen. She
pegved away till the House considered
(more or less) a motion for the adoption of
the report. Then the unexpected happened.
The report was a reflection on the Depart-
ment as administered by the Liberals ; also,
it was a reflection on officials with whom
no doubt Carmichael was working very com-
fortably. So, while practically the whole
Labor rank and file voted Yes, Carmichael
and his brother Ministers joined with the
Liberals to vote No. This meant that that
report wasn’t adopted, and the lady’s chance
of getting redress of her ancient grievance
fled into the distance. Whether the House
which said No knew one-tenth as much
about the matter as the committee which
said Yes is very doubtful. Now the lady is
battling for a Commission. And, like the
importunate woman of the Scriptures, she
will probably get it in the end. The whole
thing certainly wants cleaning up. It isn’t
at all a good thing to have such unpleasant
allegations floating around; and there are
plenty of them in the evidence and the docu-
ments. And not the least unpleasant is that
a woman without influence, up against an
official clique, hasn’t had a fair deal.
“The Old Soldier”: Max Waechter, the
peace enthusiast, grows quite lyric in the
current Contemporary on the subject of
Ibe “broad and unselfish” view that is taken
by the monarchs he has interviewed. They
are, he delights to mention, lovers of peace
almost to a sovereign. But what did he
expect? Monarchs have everything to gain
by the maintenance of the status quo. The
stupidest of them is acquainted with the
tragedies that befel those of their order who
were unsuccessful in their war-ventures.
They know that two
French emperors lost,
their billets in that
way. They know what
happened to the blind
King Ernst of Han-
over in ’66 when he
backed Austria
against Prussia. When
the European monarch
chucks his crown into
the furthest corner of
his most private
apartment, and calls
for his oldest slippers,
and when his consort
lets down her back
hair and composes
herself to yarn in
comfort, these are
the grim old stories
that are discussed.
They are family tra-
ditions, all the roy-
alties being related,
more or less ; and no-
thing dies harder than
family traditions. Cer-
tainly, the modern
monarch may not
have quite such an
innate horror of war
as his predecessor,
who was usually either
killed outright or im-
prisoned for life when
his luck was out.
They let him go now,
and as his invest-
ments are pretty
widely distributed—
because he knows
what may happen to
kings—he generally
finds himself pretty
well off for cash. At
least four monarchs
thrown out of a job
have found their con-
tingency funds very handy even in our brief
time.
A fine, robust type of letter-writer turned
up the other morning in the columns of Mel-
bourne Age. He was an enthusiast on the
subject of bloodhounds for burglars. Not
only would he have burglars traced by blood-
hounds, but he would also like to have them
captured by bloodhounds —while, no doubt,
the populace stood round and cheered, and
glowing old ladies took up a collection in aid
of the Lost Dogs’ Hotel. After outlining
his scheme, the pathetic old barbarian
splashed out his opinion that such perform-
ances “would lessen the crimes so often un-
punished.” They might; on the other hand,
all people have not got the same unswerving
faith in the infallibility of the bloodhound’s
nose. There would be a certain amount of
uneasiness when the hounds were reported
in a crowded street, and social matters
would be practically suspended until they had
passed. Then if the hounds made one large
mistake and proceeded to tear up a bishop or
a governor for the robbery of a pair of stays
and a bangle, public confidence would start
to ebb. And the bishop or governor would
be practically worthless by the time he was
rescued and dusted. The dog .idea is full of
picturesque possibilities, but it has its limi-
tations.

“LIFERS.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ah You, a Chinese murderer, has completed a
“life” sentence in Victoria in less than six years.
He was 73 years old when he slew the other China-
man. At that time the actuaries put his expecta-
tion of life at about seven years. He sot a remis-
sion of eight months for good conduct; hence he is
sow released, having served his “natural life.”
Some men there are who loaf in gaol;
Some toil in Hymen’s fetters;
And thereby swings a joyous tale
For mere blokes and their betters.
Jim Alley came of vicious stock,
And ev’ryone predicted
The shrinking world one day he’d shock
And be of crime convicted.
He could not disappoint them all;
He swiftly got entangled
In burglar schemes. At one night call
His prey he shot and strangled.
The judge shed tears for him —hot tears
That splashed upon his papers;
Then gave him “life.” All his young years
Were forfeit for his capers.
The self-same day his term began
Saw his good brother falter,
A godly, meek and well-dressed man,
Before the marriage altar.
The organ thundered while the priest
The dread words was pronouncing ;
Anon towards the wedding feast
His bride with him went flouncing.
For thirty years he led a life
Of misery and terror;
In intervals of wedded strife
He cursed his nuptial error.
One day, while walking through the town,
A ghost his elbow tackled,
And looked him slowly up and down —•
A fat, grey ghost unshackled!
“Good Lord!” he cried. “Who let you out?’
(A long, strong drink he needed.)
It sighed, that spectre grey and stout,
“My lifetime I exceeded!
“They figured out I should have died ;
But somehow death miscarried.
Ilow’ve you been getting on Outside?”
The husband groaned, “Still married!”
“Poor devil!” said the spectre grey.
“No wedding bells for Percy!
Thank God a judge put me away—
These parsons show no mercy.”

Cremation, as a clean and tidy way of dis-
posing of the dead, seems to be coming into
practice at the Queenborough Cemetery,
Hobart. A discharged gravedigger reports
that, owing to the crowded state of the
ground, a number of coffins have latelv been
dug up and placed on rubbish heaps, where,
“in some instances, they were burnt.” A
thrill of horror is said to be going through
the community on account of these ghoulish
revelations. No self-respecting person who
really thinks about death and corruption
would, however, revolt at the thought of
one’s personal remains being disinterred and
burned. The really horrible thing is that
bodies, as a rule, are buried and not burned.
A MISTAKE.
FIRST GIRL: “Poor old Billy Bronson reckons
he ought to have got a registration paper
instead of a marriage certificate.”
SECOND GIRL: “How does he make that out?”
FIRST GIRL: "Well, he says he has led a dog’s
life since the day he was married.”
A Melbourne bricklayer's laborer has pro-
vided the long-looked-for solution of the diffi-
cult problem “When is a man drunk?” He
told a suburban court the other dav: “I go
on drinking till 1 think I'm drunk. Then I
take more till I believe Pm sober. Then I
know I m drunk.”
THE POINT OF VIEW.
"Ah , you don't appreciate a
domesticated wife. You
ought to have married one like Mrs.
Stoppowt!”
“ Ah, yes , now! There's a woman for you—
can win enough in a night at Bridge to
keep the house going a fortnight! ”
A poor fellow made a sad mistake down
Carrum (Vic.) way during the Christmas
holidays. There was a large colony of mixed
campers at Carrum, and the
hapless man who fell into
error was one of them. He
was, lurking by night in a
secluded place on the look-
out for adventures, when a
lone lass passed his way.
The lurker made his dash,
and forced his company on
unguarded Minetta. Min-
etta proceeded to resist cap-
ture —proceeded so reso-
lutely that within lOsec.
positions were reversed, and
the man was the unwilling
captive. The things she did
to that poor man beggar
description, and 90 p.c. of
the things she said would,
if printed, give this paper
an unprecedented sale and
the editor seven years’ gaol.
She put his right eye under
hatches with her first
straight left; she crossed
him with a right to the
point that made him feel as
if his head had swung round
on its pivot, making nine
clear revolutions; she went
over a large repertoire of
hooks, jabs, rips, stabs and
body blows; she threw him
with a cross buttock, and
when assistance came she
was trying her best to stifle
him by sitting on his head
and pushing his face into
the sand. It was all a piti-
ful blunder. Minetta was a
bloke going to a fancy-dress shivoo in one of
the big tents —a bloke with a short temper
and an excellent record as an amateur
athlete.
From cabled accounts of the English
weather during the past few weeks: —
Yesterday London was shrowded in the densest
fog it has experienced for years....lt was a fog of
the pea-soup variety, the glaring electric lights were
dimmed by the thick shifting mixture of dirt and
atmosphere.... Snow drifts have formed many feet
deep.... In the South of Scotland work has been
suspended in the shipyards. .. .A hurricane has been
raging in the South of Ireland. Several houses have
been blown down.... Forty acres of bog near Castle-
rea have slipped, and the movement threatens the
hamlet....ln the Peak district, Derby, many villages
have been isolated. . . For 33 hours the flakes have been
falling cont'nuouslv. . . .Two telegraph linesmen were
walking along the line when a train loomed out of
the fog and killed them....An express, travelling at
50 miles an hour, crashed into a slow train near
the metropolis. .. .From the country a number of
deaths are reported from exposure.
All of which, of course, goes to show that
the tropics are not a fit place for white men
to live in.
1.1 .M. : I fully endorse the sentiments
expressed by George Gordon McCrae in re-
gard to the call for a statue to the memory
of Bass. Australians have certainly thus
honored far less worthy men. But Gabo
Island is not an ideal site for the purpose.
It is rather a curious fact that though Bass,
on his famous whale-boat expedition from
Port Jackson to Western Port, sailed close
round Cape Howe, both going and returning,
he saw no island lying there. Flinders also
missed it when aboard the schooner Francis,
bound for the wreck
of the Sydney Cove.
In his “Terra Aus-
tralis” he tells us that
“on coming abreast of
Cape Howe we sought
in vain for the small
island mentioned by
Capt. Cook as lying
close off the Cape.”
However, a larger ob-
jection is that a
memorial erected there
would be seen only
from a distance, and
th en bv compara-
tively few. Probably
half the people who
pass Gabo pass it
when asleep. A mon-
ument, if it is to have
its full educational or
sentimental value,
must be placed where
it is likely to most
widely impress the
minds of the rising
generation; and a
site much more ap-
propriate than Gabo
for a Bass monument
would surely be found
on or about the wat-
ers of Port Jackson —
the starting-point of
his maritime exploits.
As an alternative
site, the naval base
now in process of in-
cubation at Western
Port—t h e terminus
of his most memor-
able exploit—might be suggested as a fitting
location for a monument to the discoverer
of the inlet.
Along the South Melbourne beach now
bathers are not privileged to mix it after
30 o’clock in the morning, or before the
break of day. The local council considers
it detrimental to morality and dangerous to
good government for the sexes to get wet
together after dark. Open sea bathing is
permitted, but male and female bathers have
sections of sea allotted to them, and are cut
off from each other by an imaginary line.
For the love that laughs at locksmiths an
imaginary line is a poor barrier, and the
council’s officers are having a lot of trouble
drafting the dippers. One person forcibly
removed from the female section on a recent
hot evening is making some uproar, claim-
ing that she was justified in disporting her-
self in those waters despite a somewhat con-
spicuous moustache. In another case the
offender was a female caught splashing in
the male _ element, thinly disguised in limp
Dundrearies. And men are adopting con-
spicuous busts and other conventions to
pass muster with the dames and damsels in
the gloaming. Bathing is, in fact, more
mixed than ever, and the council’s coast-
guards find themselves unable to take action
in the absence of medical evidence. Nowa-
nights when you see a pretty girl bobbing
in the billows at South Melb. with a frozen
spinster in tough curls and a poke bonnet,
you can rest assured that it is Sissie and
Bill taking the w r aters together in defiance
of an obnoxious law.
One of the many abominable railway level-
crossings on the Adelaide plain has just been
responsible for another horrid motor smash.
Involved in it were a train on the Mel-
bourne line, a tramcar, a cyclist, a porter
in charge of the crossing (which has no
gates), and a sharebroker taking three
friends for a run in his new car. The tram
got across safely, but hid the train from the
car. which knocked down the cyclist and the
porter, and then got its rear half caught
under the engine. The cyclist and the por-
ter managed to roll clear ; the owner of the
car and a friend, who had been sitting by
him, were dragged 50 yards in the ruins,
and had a marvellous escape from death;
the lady and boy in the back were killed
instantly.
The Ma Stater who ever murders a bird
outside his fowl-yard might do worse than
invest in a copy of a recent Gazette notice
containing the long list of birds “absolutely
protected until June 30, 1924.” Sea-gulls
(all descriptions), the brush turkey, wonga
pigeon, plain turkey (or bustard), stone
plover (land curlew), peewit or magpie,
flycatchers (dozens of them"), the various
wrens and robins and larks and thornbills
and swallows, the lyre-bird, the laughing
Jack, some cuckoos and cockatoos, the grass
parrakeet, the satin bower-bird —these are
a few among the fliers that the law has
taken definitely under its wing for 11 years.
The emu is protected, tOo, and there is a lot
less to be said in favor of that. He might
have been worth protection had one fool not
introduced the prickly pear and a lot of
other fools permitted the curse to get out
of bounds. As things are, the little good the
big fellow does is more than outweighed by
the evil he drops after him.
Another chemical store, stuffed with com-
bustible drugs and surrounded by shops, went
up in flame and smoke last week, at South
Melbourne. It was a beautiful stack for a
fire. The ground floor was occupied by the
chemical works, the first floor held a print-
erv. with the usual inflammable accessories,
and, out in the yard, two girls boiled resin
and tar in a cauldron with a capacity of 150
gallons. Of course, the diabolic mixture
boiled over at last, and a hissing sheet of
flame like a raw devil leapt into the air. The
scared females sped screarhing from the
place; but, before they had screamed more
than twice, the cauldron was roaring and
smoking like Sodom and Gomorrah. Twenty
minutes more and the whole job was over.
Three dozen firemen, arrayed in hot brass
helmets and warm language, looked at the
smouldering ruins and cracked walls, and
thanked Heaven there had been no’ third
storey.. It would most probably have been
filled with oil or dynamite, or some other
madly appropriate substance. Incidentally,
one would like to know if there are many
girls employed during the Australian sum-
mer in the wholesale resin and tar boiling
business. It seems a torrid sort of fancy-
work more suited to a hardened ship’s
stoker than a young woman.
RESPECTABILITY BEFORE EVERY.
THING.
"Don’t you dare fire that thing off till yon put
your trousers on!”
The turning-down of an offer by the N.S.W.
Dental Association to equip an honorary
dental corps in connection with the citizen
army of the Commonwealth may, oi
may not, be good. If it is done because the
Minister for Defence declines to have any
honorary and more or less amateur addi-
tions to the military system, it is good ; if
it is due to an ignorance of the value of the
skilled tooth-smith to an army, then it is
bad. Forty-four per cent, of the injuries in the
Russo-Jap campaign were in the region of
the teeth and jaw. Which makes this paper
rather regret the fact that there is no special
arrangement for putting politicians in the
firing line.
THE USEFUL SEX.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Thank Heaven. I have a husband," said a dressy
dame to a pair of mere spinsters. “You've got no
idea what useful creatures men are if they're pro-
perly trained.’’ — Woman’s Letter (B. 9/l/'l3).
Run up and wake your father, pet;
I'm sure that he is sleeping yet,
Although it's nearly five o’clock and such a lot to
do!
Just tell him mother’s tea’s to get,
The breakfast table isn’t set.
And say to heat the boiler up- to bath Suzette and
you.
Oh, here he is! flood morning, Ned ;
I’m sure I thought that you were dead.
You just look out, or you’ll be sleeping all your
brains away.
However you can stay abed,
Espeshly after what I said
bast night! I told you twenty times that this was
washing day.
Now, pop the kettle on, and—wait !
Bring in a drink of milk for Kate ;
The poor child should have had it quite half an hour
ago—
We always seem to rise so late—-
You’ll find the milk jug at the gate.
For goodness sake, hook up this dress! Oh, dear,
you are, so slow !
And, Ned, the chimney at the back
Has got a great big gaping crack—
You better mix some plaster up and mend it right
away.
1 wish you’d bag that ton of slack :
It looks untidy in the stack.
And while you're in the garden, dear, you might turn
on the spray.
Call father in now, you, Suzette;
His breakfast’s spoiling on the jet. .. .
Oh, come on Ned ; you laze about as if you were a
Turk.
Now, drink your tea, and don’t forget
To bring your wages home, old pet.
And get a move on, daddy dear, or you’ll be late for
work !

HIS LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He said his love was like a red, red rose,
As .if the phrase had been his own invention ;
And as I marked his style and red, red nose,
I pitied her, with thoughts I needn’t mention.
He said she always played a cheery part—
Had many virtues, each one eighteen-carat;
Then staggered on, and clasped her to his heart —
His love indeed, a bottle of old claret.

“The Pariah”: Sanderson’s timber mill
has worked only one day since the holidays. It was
a groggy band that stood up to the benches on

thin,, to hand down as a terrible family legend.

was the best pick-me-up imaginable—better than a

“Don Q.”: Was chuckling in a railway
carriage over the recent Bulletin yarn of the English
new-chum who drove a horse into town with his feed-
bag on his (the horse’s) head, and handed the paper
across to an old cove opposite for his edification.
“I used to think those experiences were made up,”
he said, “until I ran into one myself. My place is on
the Downs, and not long ago I had two immigrants
sent up to me from Brisbane. I started them on
ringbarking. Gave them two axes and a day’s
tucker, showed ’em how to cut around the trees, took
’em to the paddock and left them for the day. At
tea that night one of the boys asked them how they
got on and how they liked the work. ‘Oh, all
right,’ said Chummy No. 1 ; ‘but I s’pose it doesn’t
matter if we leave them dead trees till the last.
They’re bloomin’ ’ard!’”

“Gouger”: When the devil of necessity
drives, Brother Binghi can do good work with his
hands. On a cattle station outside of Cooktown
(Q.) a Binghi lately got a leg so badly smashed
that it had to be amputated. lie returned to the
station awkwardly on a wooden leg, and cursed
vilely when he tried to balance the end of his bit of
timber in the stirrup iron. After due consideration
he felled a cork tree, and trimmed a limb out of
one of its branches. Then he returned to work with
a well-fitted leg, foot and all complete. Now he
walks and rides almost as well as he did before the
smash-up.

“S.S.S.”: The Papuan idea is that the
more you have been corrected by the “Gubiment” the
better, of course, you ought to be. Laria, my
“cooky boy,’’ had finished his 12 months’ service,
and was “signing off.” Being a Courabadian and a
gentleman, he sought someone to take his place.
Two or three had been politely dispersed—some for
having too many friends, whereby one’s sugar and
butter just melted ; one for dropping cigarette ends
in the curry; another for chewing betel out of its
lawful occasion. Laria came home from Hanuabada
followed by Parua, whom he introduced. “He savee
cook?” I inquired. “Oh, he savee too much,” said
Laria with fervor. “He good fellow boy?” I asked.
“Oh, sinabada,” enthused Laria, ‘he too many good
fella boy. He been sit down along Gubiment three
time!” “What fashion along Gubiment?” I queried.
“He been stop along gaol—one time he been deadum
him mother along Kairuki; one time he been inakum
pourri-pourri (sorcery) ; behind he go gaol along
stealum one somesing along B.P. This time he too
many good fellow boy!” And he is.

Sharks always show themselves in Hob-
son’s Bay as the Christmas holidays approach, in the
fond hope, apparently, of picking up a few fat bathers
along the shore. One of these made a dash for
sumptuous fare among the splashers at Hampton on
Christmas Day, and then turned up a few yards
off-shore, where a score of picnickers were frisking
in the water. Only one man failed to hasten to the
landing. He was a dark, bald, bony person, and he
continued bobbing up and down with the air of a
man bent on making the most of his holiday. “Come
out! Come out!” yelled the refugees on the sand.
The dark, bald, bony man continued to bob.
“Shark! Shark!” howled the folks ashore. “Come
out,, you fool!” commanded a portly constable who
was now mixing in the public excitement. The
dark, bald, bony man noticed at length that he was
the cynosure of all eyes, and the person ad-
dressed. He put a hand behind his ear. “Vhat’s der
madder?” he asked gently. “Shark! Shark!” “I
don’d can hear vhat id iss,” said the bather, putting
his other hand behind his other ear. Meanwhile the
shark was ploughing an ominous fin through the water
behind him. Once it passed within 3ft. “Come out!”
howled the frantic crowd. “Shark! Shark! you
idiot! ” The policeman waded in up to his knees.
“Come out!” he roared. “There’s a shark just
behind you. Come out!” “I cahndt hear me which
iss id you say,” said the bather impatiently. The
frantic policeman beckoned with all his arms. “Come
out! Shark! Come out!” Then he straightened
himself. “Come oud?” he said. “I vill nod come
oud! I haff buy me der cosdume. I haff no bus’ness
to come oud.” And he didn’t. A few minutes later
the shark, being unable to discover anything to its
taste, withdrew from the scene.
“W’lang”: The immigrant isn’t the only
one who makes the cocky rave. In the Mallee,
during the present harvest, a “hand,” who had been
sent up from Melbourne by one of the employment
agencies, was told to clean and oil a stripper. He
did so with great thoroughness, poking out all the
oil holes and shifting the cotton waste used to
economise the oil—colloquially known as “wicks.”
The boss went to see how the work was done, and,
noticing the absence of the waste, said: “You haven’t
put any wicks in the machine.” With a look of
disgust came the reply: “Say, boss, I don’t mind
driving the thing by daylight, but take it from me
I’m not goin’ to do it at night, too.”

THE TALE THAT “MULGA” TOLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The word ’ad come to Camel Hunch that out, a long
day’s ride
From Piker’s pub, some fellow ’ad improvidently
died.
“ ’E’s dead a week, or maybe two,” our droll in-
formant said ;
“In fact, I never seen a bloke so permanently dead,
Or looking quite so satisfied,
Because he simply went an’ died
With no-one round ’is bed.
I must be pushin’ on,” ’e said —“along to God-
Knows-Where ;
An’ yet it’s ’ardly Christian-like to leave ’im lyin’
there,
A-shrivellin’-up beneath the sun, a banquet for the
crows,
T s clobber flappin’ dismally to ev’ry wind that
blows,
’ls orbs a-starin’ at the skies—
Great wide an’ stark an’ starin’ eyes
That someone ought to close.
“I don’t suppose it matters much where one may
choose to die,
So long as ’e ain’t sick’nin’-like to qualmy passers-
by.
It's just a thing of sentiment —for none of us would
care
To leave our bones so far from ’ome, all baked, an’
bleached, an’ hare.
So, mates, ’twould be a Christian act
To cover ’is remains intact,
An', maybe, speak a pray’r.
“ ’E might ha’ been an atheist, an’ wants no man
to kneel
Beside ’is grave an’ ask the Lord to stack the cards
for deal.
But yet ’e might ha’ been a man who lived serene
an’ pure,
Skedaddlin’ like ole ’Arrv from Delilah’s scented
lure.
So,' ’twixt the doorpost there an’ us,
I guess, without unseemly fuss,
We might as well make sure.”
The stranger bought two rounds o’ drinks. An’ after
’e ’ad showed
Exactly where to find the corpse, to God-Knows-
Where ’e rode.
We bore the chap no grudge, because —although ’e
was afraid
To yank the bones to Piker’s pub—-’e had no pick
or spade.
An’ know you this: a three-foot ’ole,
Where decency may take its dole,
Is not so easy made.
“I guess that stranger spoke the truth,” young
Jack McCluskey said.
“We’ll act as a committee for the burial of the
dead ;
For ev’ry man can die but once, an’ so it’s only
right
That them who's still cm deck should shove the car-
case out of sight.
An’ so, I beg to move that we,
Jack Chandler, ‘Mulga Mick’ an’ me,
Inter this bloke to-night.
“Maybe we’ll get no thanks for it, but probably the
cuss,
If we was lyin’ where e lies, would do the same for
us.
'E wouldn’t want to know our p&sts, what laws we
’ad trangrest;
’E'd simply fold our arms an’ lay our weary bones
to rest,
An’, ’avin done so, go ’is way—
Unless, perchance, ’e stopped to say
‘Whatever is, is best.’ ”
A sizzlin’ moon was clutchin’ with red fingers at the
sky,
An’ in the ghostly mulga clumps the wind went
moanin’ by
When we at last surveyed the shell of im who passed
away
With no one near to lend a ’and or pass the time o
day.
T tell you, 'twas a dismal sight—
Enough to turn a black man white,
Or make a lost soul pray.
We dug a hole to windward, an' we worked like men
possessed
To ’ide from mortal eyes the man whose name we
never guessed.
An’ when the grave was deep enough we gently
shoved ’im in.
The winds ’ad dropped—an’ such a ’ush ! —I think a
failin’ pin,
Or just the shadow of a shade,
Would in that solitude ’ave made
A most unseemly din.
“An' now,” spoke Jack McCluskey, in a faint, be-
whiskied breath,
“It's only right that we preserve the dignity of
death;
I move that we, the Mourners Three, this stranger s
soul prepare
For that which will, for good or ill, be 'is eternal
share....
Well kneel together now an’ pray....
Will some one kindly lead the way
In valedict’ry pray’r?”
But not a sound of pray’rfulness from our dry lips
would come.
It seemed as if the three of us was struck completely
dumb !
At length McCluskey whispered low: “For God’s sake,
lead the way,
An’ speak the pray'r that is the most appropriate to
say.”
But, sad to tell, there came no meed
Of pray’r of any kind— for we’d
Forgotten ’ow to pray!
The words we’d learnt at ’ome an’ ease from mem’ry
was effaced
(A far, far cry from mothers’ knees to that great
godless waste!)
An’ from Its grave It still looked up with cold, wide-
starin' eyes.
An’ out across the dark beneath the star-bespangled
skies ;
But, if It ’arked, It never ’eard
One solitary savin’ word,
Save “dammit” an’ three sighs.
“Ah, well,” said Mac, “since pray’rs are off, we’ll
do the thing that’s fair.
So, till ’e’s ’idden from our view, not one of us will
swear !
\n’ after all, I don’t suppose, were we not stricken
dumb,
That all our disremembered pray’rs would ’elp ’im
worth a thrum,
Or land ’is West o’ Sunset soul,
Marked ‘This side up,’ unsmirched an’ whole,
Saloon, to Kingdom Come.”
The moon was still a-clutehin’ with red fingers at
the sky ;
We filled the grave an’ drank to them who in such
places die ;
The night-winds sang a requiem in each black clump
of scrub
(They seemed to know just what to say—an’ therein
lay the rub!)....
We smoothed the warm grey mound of sand
In consecrated silence—and
Rode back to Piker's pub.
NEVER NEVER LAND.

“Ivaree”: Anent the Abo. row over the
octopus. “Fred Muir” (B. 26/12/’l2) is wrong.
The beastie is known on the coast of France, and the
French variety does live in rocky caves and feed
mostly on crustaceans. The kind described by Vic.
Hugo—the pieuvre —is found on the rocky coast of
Brittany, where, as a boy, I had my nether limb
pulled by one of a fairish size, and possessed ugly
sores as a reminder for the next two months. An-
other kind, the poulpe, is very frequent on the Medi-
terranean and Gironde coast, and preys on mud flats.
Both are deemed a morceau de choix by the unso-
phisticated fishermen. The French varieties evi-
dently differ from the Australian, in that their flat
eyes are certainly “glassy” and dull-looking. I’ve
often seen both sorts; but the only eephalopod I’ve
met with in these climes is branded C.S.R. It also,
by the way, feeds on flats.
* * * *
“Gerald Barker’s” Christian hope:—
I’d like to tell “Ginger” (B. 19/12/’l2) that all
the abos. on the goldfields of W.A. are circumcised,
as are all the Binghis inhabiting the Great Vic-
toria Desert. That, and what may be called the “race
suicide” operation, are performed amongst all the
tribes thereabouts. The latter operation was, doubt-
less, the outcome of a long-ago parley as to how the
population was to feed itself and find a sufficiency of
water. For a woman to have more than two chil-
dren is exceptional, although, nowadavs, the family*
could be increased. There are wells all over the
fields, and food-cadging from the whites has become
a profitable art. All the same, I hope the blacks
won’t multiply, because they are a nuisance to them-
selves and Jo the white man, and the sooner they
die out the Tetter.
“Mallarapoonie” (from very far back):
“F.A.T." (B. 3/10/’l2) errs in his criticism of an
old par. of mine by confounding the two distinct
brands of crocodiles in Australian waters. (1) The
Crocodilus porosus, the big salt-water or estuarine
species, mostly keeps within taste of the sea ; he is
a man-eater, a scavenger and a bad lot generally.
(2) The C. Jolinstonii, or little fresh-water fellow,
belongs rather to the gavial family, is purely a fish-
eater, and seldom if ever goes below the limit of
brackish water, frequenting only the upper reaches of
our northern rivers ; he is considered to be quite harm-
less to man or other beast. So far from it being foolish
of me to remark in print that the little crocs, do not
live in the sea, they do —little C. porosi. “F.A.T.”
further errs in supposing that C. Jolinstonii stole his
dead game from the shores of Lake Chappaginia.
C. J. of that ilk is not a scavenger, and refuses to
touch dead meat. The fowls probably fell into the
maw of C. porosus, whom I never said didn’t' also
frequent fresh water. At times he does, making a
long way inland from the sea. As exemplifying how
far inland some salt-water creatures can make: A
true shark, of real ocean birth and breeding, was
caught, a couple of years ago, in the Flinders River,
near Richmond (Q.)- —a distance, by river windings,
of nearly 400 miles from the sea. He was a rarity,
but a shark for all that. Doubtless he had been
driven upstream in flood-time by some creatures (pro-
bably C. Jolinstonii) that were not his friends.
ANOTHER HORROR!
EXCITED TEETOTAL SUBSCRIVER TO THE BEE-
NAB'S BUGLE : “It's a-a-a scandal—an
outrage! Here you've gone and headed my
beautiful article on bees, ‘ the Value of
BEER:'!”
EDITOR : “Makes no difference, my dear sir—
both have stings, you know!”
FULL OF REASONS.
“Why don't you put up your umbrella , Billy?”
“ Oh , that pheller let in too much plumy rain!”
“Silas Snell” : It was New Year’s morn-
ing. People were already tip and about their pleas-
ures, but he stood alone. He had been keeping up
the Old Year, and had
I neglected to go to bed,
I or to call in at home to
I change his shockingly
I ill-used evening suit. He
I was balancing himself
I on the kerb with the aid
| of a lamp post, hi diking
I nt the day in a manner
I suggestive of one who
[ failed to recognise the
I hemisphere he inhabited,
or to recollect the exact
I century in which he lived.
Suddenly his eye fell
upon the black and white
dog on the road-side. He
became interested in dogs.
I He was a great man for
I dogs. All his people had
been doggy, lie embraced
I the post more firmly with
I his left arm, flipped the
thumb and finger of his
right hand persuasively,
and said: “Here, boy!
| Here, boy!” The dog did
not move. Two men and
five boys paused to watch
developments. “Good dog!
Good dog!” said the gen-
tleman who did not go
home last night. “Here,
hoy! Here, boy!" 'lhe
dog absolutely ignored
him. The gentleman left
his post, tottered into the
road, and, stooping down,
carefully stayed himself
with one hand, while he
patted the dog with the
other. “Good ole Carlo!”
said he. Then he arose
with some difficulty, and
moved away, flipping h i s
fingers, and calling “Carlo,
Carlo, Carlo.” The dog
did not budge. Seventeen
adults and 36 children
were now onlooking. The
gent, who had not been to bed addressed the grow-
ing crowd. “B’u’ful dog,” he said. “Whoshe ish
he?” Nobody claimed the dog. The man who
thought it was yesterday called Carlo persuasively.
He took Carlo by the collar and dragged him 50
yards, dropped him, and cajoled again. Then he
lost patience. “Well, dammittall,” he said, “if
y’ won’t come, y’ can dash well shtay where you
are.” The dog stayed. He was dead.
“C.G.F.”: Will somebody decipher this
snake for me? At first glance it looked something
like a tiger. It was brown with black rings and a
pink belly'- The head was brown and bullet-shaped
—at least, it was before I made a few alterations.
If it is any assistance, I may add that his pantry
contained two china nest-eggs.
* * *
“Vigilans”: Mention of bird-catching in
the Northern Territory recalls an eccentric French-
man who for many years was engaged trapping birds
and reptiles in Australia, New Guinea, the South
Sea Islands and other places. He was a wonder at
the game. When I last struck his camp he was 63
years of age, blind of one eye from fly-stings, and
hardly able to see out of the other. He travelled
alone with two horses, a small cart, and a dog. He
used to make trips up the coast from Geraldton to
Broome and Derby, then across the Kimberley coun-
try to Wyndham, and from Wyndham to Darwin. On
some of his trips to Europe with birds, insects and
reptiles lie cleared over £lOOO. The most extra-
ordinary thing was how he got over the immense un-
inhabited areas without molestation from the blacks.
Once met him between Broome and Derby, and
camped the night with him. His cart was loaded
with most beautiful birds of all sizes and descrip-
tions—a wonderful collection, worth a pot of money.
He talked volubly. “I have travel ze vorld over and
over. One time I have ze commission from ze
Jardin des Plantes in Paree to collect ze snake from
the Pacifique. Parbleu ! I catch 100 serpong. I
put ze snakes in ze horse-stall under ze straw on ze
steamer. Sapristi! Ze carpenter find ze box, and he
have ze inquisitive; so what he do ? He bore one
hole in ze box with the auger. He find notings ; ze
snake dormong. Mon dieu! By-and-bye, ze snake
wake up, and all come out on ze batteau. Parbleu!
One hundred serpong. Ze passenger go mad. He
run down ze cabin and shut himself in ze room. Ze
snake he go everywhere. Up ze mast, down ze hold,
in ze cabin. Sapristi! I zink Igo mad. Ze capi-
tan he put me in ze iron. When we come to Mar-
seilles he say: ‘Now, you snake man, you jump! ’
and he give me one kick. I jump in ze water and
swim ashore. Ah, but I lose all my beautiful ser-
pong worth t’ousands of ze francs!”
* * * #
“Troddles”: If any corpulent reader
wants relief from the embraces of adipose tissue, I
can suggest a certain cure. The afilicted one need
onlv go to Sumatra and take a job on a pepper plan-
tation between February and April. During these
months the trees shed their flowers, and the air
becomes- charged with millions of particles of dust.
It penetrates the nostrils, refreshes itself in the
eyes, and flavors the beer. Some of the milder symp-
toms are loss of appetite, craving for gin, eternal
sneezing and excruciating bladder trouble. If you
survive the remedial measures for a week, there's
hope for a cure within two months. A while ago, I
was in Penang with a 16st. Bananalander, who
accepted a job as overseer on a pepper plantation at
£6 per week. Four months later, in Batavia, I met
him-—or, rather, a shrunken, orange-visaged edition
of h;m. He reckoned the disease was worse than the
cure, or the cure was worse than the disease, I forget
now. But I know he said both were the torments of
the damned.
“Snell”: Some strange things come to
town during Christmas. They come in on the Yule
tide, I suppose. One of them was on the Port Mel-
bourne platform on January 2, 1913, at a quarter to
4. I also happened to be there. He looked harmless,
but his aspect was that of a youth who had milked
a whole drove of cows every morning at 4 o’clock
for 30 years. This aspect was relieved with fitful
gleams of intelligence and vivacity, the result, possi-
bly, of the fact that he was entertaining a large con-
gregation of mixed drinks. He seemed to have no
object in life, and no intention of going anywhere •
but when a shunting locomotive steamed by on its
own, he was galvanised into sudden activity. Some-
thing was wrong. A determination to do the State
some service seized him. He jumped on the line, and
made a dash after the locomotive, whirling his head-
gear, anu yelling at the top of his voice. Two por-
ters and a line repairer sprinted after Jimbill, and
captured him as he was endeavoring to climb on the
footplate. Jimbill was taken before high authority.
He had a good excuse. “The damthing had fergot its
train,” said he.
* * * *
“McNorth”: The Papuan Government
steam yacht, Merrie England, which found its last
reef near Port Moresby recently, was really a diving
machine. The least bit of sea caused it to roll and
jump about like a distressed spirit, while an ordinary
swell made it put both rails under at once. The
vessel was sold by the noble Dook who originally
owned it because of its excessive activity. On pass-
ing into the hands of the Papuan Government, it has
been, in spite of its unsuitability, the general utility
ship of the service. In the days when it was square-
rigged the yards did duty as a gallows. When a
nigger was to be executed for, say, murdering a
white man, the vessel got up s'team for the prisoner’s
village, and he was dangled from the yard-arm in
the presence of his admiring relatives and friends.
This custom had a great civilising effect. The old
ship, besides hanging niggers, had a multiplicity of
duties to perform, not the least of which was the
carting about of officials and sick civilians from the
outlying parts to Samarai and Port Moresby. It
also acted as a travelling court-house, Parliament
House, and an administrator of vengeance in many a
punitive expedition. That little Nordenfelt on the
hurricane deck was not there for show.
“Pick”: The rabbit is generally a good
workman when he starts shearing the beard off the
landscape; but in my peregrinations about Aus-
tralia, I have found only one place where he has done
the work so thoroughly that the grass has chucked it
in disgust and refused to come any more. That is
over a stretch of 10 or 12 miles between the Eumer-
alla and Bredbo Rivers (N.S.W.). In that once-
grassy but now desert region, the nark has, more-
over, so loosened the crust by scratching for the
roots of the vanished herbage that with every blow
(and it blows some, about Billylingra) the dust rolls
onward in waves; it has heaped itself over fences
and houses, and has so filled up cuttings on the main
road that stakes have to be driven to show travellers
where the road lies beneath. Billylingra once fed
thousands of sheep. I saw five in passing through
recently, and there were five crows waiting patiently
ner. i -by on a dead tree.

“Gouger” on an Australian variety of fly-
trap orchid: —
The most marvellous plant I have come across in
Australia hangs out its sign near the thin end of
Gape York It grows straight up for about six
inches in the shape of a bulb. At the top is a tube
containing a sweet, sticky liquid. A tiny lid is
fitted to the tube by a delicate hinge, and, when
closed, the cell is perfectly air-tight. Now comes a
Hj, sees the door open, observes the honey inside, rolls
up his pants, wades in, and is promptly bogged On
every occasion that I have watched, five flies have
got into the soup before the lid went, on the pot A
few hours later they look exactly like a bird which
a snake has half i.igcsted. You have to burgle the
premises to see this, because the door does not volun-
tarily open until the flies have entirely disappeared.

WEW-YEAR VISITOR : “Fire away , Mister.

“Gee Gee”: This true bill shows that our
birthstain still sticks. I was standing at the door of
a Sydney hotel yesterday. In front of the pub were
two fellow countrymen, slowly pulling an iron roller
over portion of a newly asphalted street. An obvious
new-chum wandered down the hall, and stood along-
side me, watching the operation. Mopping his face,
he remarked: “Dreadful to make the convicts work
at that game in this-weather, isn’t it!”


THE TEST.
At the Science Congress in Melbourne, a paper on “The Wastefulness of Armaments” was read by Mr. W. Siebenhaar. Deputy Government
Statistician of Westralia. He said the manly spirit of the nation had throughout history been shown to afford a safer guarantee ot self-
defence than expensive war preparations.

Studiousness runs in the family of Frank
Kerr, of Melbourne, who captured a
Rhodes Scholarship the other day. A bro-
ther, a boy of 20, passed his third year in
medicine ; a younger brother took a Wesley
College Scholarship; and a fourth got a
Government Scholarship—all within a
month or so.
An old western N.S.W. native, Peter
Macpherson Rotton, died on Saturday, aged
72. He was a brother of Mrs. Iveightley, who
obtained some fame in connection with the
ransom of her husband from Hall’s gang of
bushrangers at Dunn’s Plains. She drove
to Bathurst, and obtained the needed £5OO
from Henry Rotton, the father of the man
who has just had a funeral.
STUBBS , President of the W.A. Legislative
Council.
Poincare, the new French President, is a
big man, of very short stature. He is a
journalist and a lawyer, and in the latter
capacity one of the greatest barristers in
Paris. As a scientist he has a lot of fame,
and is one of the forty of the French Acad-
emy. Although, like most of his country-
men, he is ready to take on a toy duel at'a
moment’s notice, or to fight a real one if the
necessity arises, he has, as Premier, exer-
cised a large influence for European peace.
Poincare is just the sort of man that in
earlier Republican days might have been
Dictator or Emperor or any old thing; under
the present system of elective and temporary
monarchy—which is what the French Presi-
dency amounts to —he is about as useful a
person as the nation in its sober working
mood could well have at the head of affairs.
I?ied unexpectedly, on January 19, Alfred
Webb, Superintendent of N.S.YV. Fire Bri-
gades. He was 15 years a fire-lighter in
io°oo d ° n ’ and j oinod the Sydney Brigade in
1888. so he had wrestled with heat and
smoke for 40 years. Webb’s chief woe was
the crying need of a Building Act; the city
seemed to him to have been constructed
specially to invite an immense conflagration.
All sorts of benefit performances haopen
at Melbourne King's Theatre (there was
once an interesting matinee show in aid of

BUI Anderson’s affability must have been
reached when he gave the house for the last
night of “The Girl of the Never Never” to
the “organisers of the Fund for Mr. Pren-
dergast’s holiday trip abroad”—all the tak-
ings to go to the Fund to give the ineffective
leader of the Labor party in the Yic. State
Parliament a trip to Europe. The Bul-
letin hopes it will do him good. The im-
provement of Mr. Prendergast is certainly
quite possible.
Dead in Maoriland, John Bryce, once a
big figure in the politics of ' the Shaky
Islands. He took a prominent part in the
various Maori wars, entered Parliament in
ISil, and held office in several Ministries
from 1879 onwards. He was a very solid
Tory of the old school, and when Ballanee
came into power, Atkinson resigned the
leadershin of the party, and Bryce took his
place. He was the plaintiff in Maoriland’s
biggest libel suit. G. W. Rnsden, in his
“History of Maoriland,” had declared that
Bryce, when in charge of cavalry, had
dashed upon women and children and cut
them down gleefully. The historian had to
pay £5OOO for that indiscretion.

The suggestion of “Billy B.” that Deakin has no
stomach expresses a half-truth. What stomach
Deakin possesses is in a state of constant rebellion.
Those who have travelled with him know that if they
complain of a headache, Alfred will at once produce
from a small medicine-chest a pill or mixture to
meet the case. Such things are always kept handy
bv Deakin. He lives constantly in physical and men-
tal actions and reactions. A big speech is a fearful
strain upon him, and I have often seen him in a
sorry state of excitement before beginning the job.
This feeling (from which he suffers now as keenly
as when he started in politics) vanishes the moment
he enters the meeting hall. After his speech—which
never seems to be any effort at all in the delivery—
he becomes talkative to friends, keeping up a con-
stant nervous chatter. He will not have a drink,
but goes to bed and remains awake till he has re-
delivered his speech twice. Then he sleeps till five or
six o’clock. In his early political days he used to
drink a substantial nip of whisky neat before he
started ; but the reaction was so tremendous that he
stopped the spirit. All his nervousness comes from
his innards, or else his innards come from his nerves
The only other complaint he suffers from, as far as I
know, is cold feet.
“Chudah” from the steps of the Syna-
gogue :
The billet of Chief Rabbi in London is not yet
jhu may b e > perhaps. America, Germany
and the rest of the Yid universe have no chief •
therefore it is held that England does not need one.
V o e , Ve that all the Australian rabbis led by Cohen
of Sydney, Abrahams of West Melbourne, Boas of
Adelaide, Lenzer of East Melbourne and Danglow of
St Kilda, hold this opinion. The late Chief Rabbi
Adler threatened to cut off both Sydney and Mel-
bourne for alleged breaches of order: (1) having
mixed choirs of men and women ; (2) introducing
English into the Ritual. But he evidently doubted
m g . authority. Rabbi Abrahams, of Melbourne,
visited England last year, and the glamor of his
eloquence caused the Jewish Chronicle, of London,
to declare that he should be a candidate for Chief
However, out of sight out of mind; he has dropped
from _ the running, and is not amid the first three
mentioned. Inasmuch as they of course represent the
party wanting a Chief Rabbi, and the other party is
very strong, it is likely that all the backers will
presently concentrate on Dr, Drachman. Montefiore
and the Liberals are against having any Chief; the
Tories, headed by the Rothschildren, take the other
side.
A couple of the members of the Imperial
Trade Commission now steaming to Aus-
tralia and expected to arrive early in Feb-
ruary, will make a good eyeful. Besides,
Rider Haggard, author of “She.” “King
Solomon’s Mines,” and other weird imagin-
ings, there is Edgar Vincent, the chairman,
a diplomatist, financial expert, world travel-
ler and philologist. He can also shoot
straight and head a regiment. Among other
things he has been financial adviser of the
Egyptian Government and president of the
Ottoman Public Debt Commission. He
talks and writes modern Greek as fluently
as Oysteropoulos himself; in fact, a Greek
grammar of his construction is now the
class textbook in the University of Athens.
The first chairman of the Trade Commis-
sion was Lord Inchcape, but he died. The
many-sided Arnold succeeded him; but his
wife died, and the shock drove him into
seclusion. In that way Vincent came into
control.
“The Oldest,” concerning a lady who won’t
stay buried :
“Looking Backward” is in error (B. 9/l/’l3). As
a matter of fact, there were three alleged Margaret
Catchpoles. (1) What we call the real Margaret,
Will Land’s girl, who came out in the Nile in 1800—
an illiterate _ woman, who died on the Hawkesbury
and was buried in Richmond cemetery, according to
the certificate of Parson Fulton, in 1819. (2) Mary
Haydock, an educated woman, who came out in the
Royal Admiral in 1792, and married Thomas Raby
(afterwards written Reibey), and established a busi-
esB in Sydney, founded a family, became wealthy,
and died at Reibey House, Newtown, in 1855. (3)
The, mythical Margaret, the one mentioned in “The
National Biography,” which termed her “an adven-
turess, and said to have died in Castlereagh-street
Sydney, in 1841. Mrs. Reibey, in 1839. lived in a
red square brick house on the corner of Liverpool and
Elizabeth streets, where in later years Dr. Renwick
built a terrace, now being converted into commercial
houses. The John Barry myth, relied upon by “Look-
ing Backward, ’ is simply the Cobbold blunder re-
peated. Cobbold, before being taken to task on the
subject, married Margaret to John Barry, which was
simply a thin variation of “Raby.”
A note from Mendoza, Argentina
(20/11/T2) :
A. G. (“Smiler”) Hales has packed up the pen
that is mightier than the sword and streaked for the
Balkans, after two years of the strenuous life in
Buenos Aires, varied by little incursions into Bolivia
and Patagonia in pursuit of the elusive “wild cat”
and copy. He left by the Frisia a few days ago
with a purse of sovs. and as many good wishes as
his excess-baggage rights would allow him to take on
board. Though not the irresponsible whom the Aus-
tralian Inky Way knew 20 years ago, Hales is still
quick off the mark, and has hopes of seeing the
last lap of the Unspeakable’s sprint out of Europe.
He should have more sense at his time of life; but
“Smiler” is “Smiler,” and Australian at that.
THE TURNING OF THE REJECTED
WORM.
[?]; " Very well! You'll have a hard job to
get another man like me."
James Lees, a military veteran, died last
week, aged 83 years, lie arrived in Van
Diemen’s Land in 1848 as sergeant in the
11th Regiment. The regiment was ordered
to Sydney when the 99tu struck work over
a dispute about rum. This little incident is
known as “The Grog Mutiny.” For some
reason, Despard, the colonel, "had stopped the
men’s grog, but offered a money allowance
just one-half of what the men considered it
should be. Old General O’Connell appealed
to them to return to duty, but they laughed
at the old man, who thereupon threat-
ened to arm the convicts on Cockatoo Island
and lead them against the mutineers. Then
he thought of tiie 11th across the Straits.
A vessel was chartered, and 400 rank and
hie were immediately shipped for the scene.
When off Coogee the vessel was struck by a
succession of westerly winds, which kept it
outside for over a week. Meanwhile the
99th had returned to duty, the grog episode
having been adjusted amicably. The lltli
was the first regiment to occupy Victoria
-Barracks. Lees left the army and joined
the detective force, and thence passed to
pub-keeping. There are a couple more of
the old 11th still left in Sydney.
ma Mle of the late Alexander Dowie,
ot ■Mon City (U.S.A.), has been appro-
by one Bill Laslett, of Footscray
(Melbourne), the place where the awful
srpells come from. Laslett claims to be the
1 rophet Elijah, up-to-date, and his trouble
just now is that he owes £7 to a local timber
merchant, and doesn’t feel strong enough to
work off the debt. Since he became a prophet
he has had nothing but persecution, he says
which accounts for his not feeling well,
lime was when prophets thrived on persecu-
tion, but the Elijahs of late are looking for
sympathy and four meals a day. Unfortu-
nately, there are few practical sympathisers
vuth people who suffer from revelations. It
was all right to be the long bearded Elijah
in the wilderness of yore, but as soon as his
duly appointed successor starts to deliver
inspired messages at his suburban street cor-
ner, the boys desire him to Get Work and
never a she bear comes out of the wood to
tear those boys to pieces.
“B. de Burke,” with the pick and shovel:
K Hamilton Bethune Lindsay, of St
Kiida (lie.), tells a story, encompassed by a great
Varl d °p f T Wlt V esses > *° P rove that he is the eleventh
J ' a . rl , of Lmdsay. He claims that he is the next-
18Qef (r° th i r - ° f the „ Ka , rl of Lindsay, who died in
4 , 89 . 4 - , My kinsman Burke, in his “Peerage,” says
that the second son of the ninth earl died at Mar-
seilles on July 5, 1862, leaving no issue. The
claimant says he is this gentleman, and alleges that
he didn t die, although he was in hospital there
? le , serving as a midshipmite in the ’6o’s. He says
4hat a family interference in a love affair made
th( „? )aint< 7 with his relatives and come to
Australia. His wife (whom he married three years
ago) has goaded him into claiming the earldom and
next_ month he leaves for London to begin his fight
He is over 70, and by calling a woolclasser. The
w n ■ 6n h T l ? t ° ry of the Lindsays begins in 1356. Sir
William Lindsay obtained the Barony of the Byres in
that year. One of the line gallantly assisted in the
murder of Queen Mary’s poetical charmer, IHzzio!
and another fought against Cromwell, for which he
f 5 * 10 . y S arS ll!?ht labor at Windsor Castle. The
tenth lord was made an earl by Charles I. The
claimant tells a very circumstantial yarn, and if
his witnesses make good, the wife has more than an
outside chance of becoming a countess.
The third vol. of the new supplement to
the “Dictionary of National Biography” is
out in London, thereby completing the record
of notabilities who have slipped off the globe
during the past 10 years. Among the Aus-
tralians are Charles Nicholson, old-time poli-
tician, one of the founders of the Sydney
University, and “Australia’s first baronet” ;
also George Salting, who once lived in Mac-
quarie-street, Sydney, then sailed to London,
went in for collecting art treasures, did well!
died worth £1,287,900, and bequeathed most
of his collections to London museums. Dr.
Saumarez Smith is described as having led a
“useful rather than an
eventful career” as Arch-
bishop of Sydney. Julian
Salomons “first found em-
ployment in a bookselling
establishment in Sydney,”
and afterwards became
secretary of the local
Synagogue. Sydney Jews
subscribed and sent him
to London to qualify for
the Bar. He is summed
up as “a brilliant lawyer
and analytical reasoner.”
Brunton Stephens “stands
in the forefront of Aus-
tralian poets.” He had
“a metrical facility and
a whimsical humor.” Also
he was the “central figure
of the literary circle m
Brisbane that blossomed
into the Johnsonian
C 1 u b.” David Syme
“claimed, with justice, to
exercise the deciding
voice in the appointment
of every Victorian Pre-
mier and Cabinet Minis-
ter.” And Dick Seddon
is followed as he devel-
oped into “a highly popu-
lar and imposing figure
throughout the Empire;
frank, genial, abounding
in self-confidence, and
displaying immense industry, energy and
courage as an administrator.”
Veteran explorer Captain John Watson
went aloft at Port Chalmers (M.L.) re-
cently, aged 78. He sailed to the Arctic
regions as an apprentice on the barque To
Victory in 1848 ; was ice-master of the four-
gun Dolphin when that 216-tonner went
mineral-hunting to Greenland in ’56, and
was wrecked a couple of times while oursu-
ing the animal that swallowed Jonah.
Later, he commanded various vessels trading
between London and Australia. He was in
charge of the Collingwood when the barque
was sent to the Chatham Islands shortly
after the escape of the rebel Maori chief Te
Kooti, and brought back a hundred or so
Maoris to Taranaki. Settling down ashore,
he was secretary to the Otago Harbor Trust
for 18 years.
“HAPPY JACK" SCADDAH,
Premier of W.A.
THE WORK OF OUR HANDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is “sickness of the fusion” that is the matter
with Mr Deakin, in the opinion of Mr. Parker
Moloney, M.H.R. This assumption, however, is im-
mediately met and crushed by the fact that the
fusion is to a great extent the work of Mr. Deakin’s
own hands. —Sydney D.T. (16/1/’l3).
Now every man is his own sad cook, for he mixes
and bakes his dough,
And the relics burnt that his oven gives as the work
of his hands we know ;
If his good tooth breaks on the crusted thing, and he
throws it back on the shelf,
What dullard will urge that it must be good, as he
baked the horror himself?
The very worst messes of life are made by the honest
and clear-eyed men ;
But the hour draws on when the Fuser feels he must
turn to the truth again ;
the work of our hands is a mixture strange—some
is good, some is vain, some mad,
But the man with a soul of his own to save,
He must stand off and say ere he gains the grave
With a critical squint, “D—n Bad!” (P.S. —And
most of our work is Bad.)

That table still groans under the weight of the bad
things provided by the boom of the late ’Bo’s and
early ’9o’s. It ought to serve as a horrible example
to the man who is inclined to go on a financial jag.
Unfortunately the man almost invariably says, after
the first drink or two, that it’s quite a different sort
of tipple he’s getting to-day, and so there’s not going
to be any headache in the morning. There is a dif-
ference in the tipple of to-day and that of 25 years
ago, but not enough to entirely abolish the headache.
The worst of the old trouble was caused by drought,
which dropped in when the State had a dreadful in-
terest bill to pay ; and the same drought may happen
along now—is certain, indeed, to happen along at
some time or other. However, it is pretty certain
that, if the old lesson was lost on some, it hasn’t been
lost on the banks of Queensland. They have been
moving most circumspectly. Probably no others in
Australia have made a bigger change in their posi-
tion, visible and internal.
The Q.N. can’t yet pay a dividend. When the
smash came it had to make an arrangement—the
first of several—with its creditors. The position was
so bad that one-fourth of the debt to creditors other
than the State was written off, and it was agreed
that it should be repayable only out of future divi-
dends. Moreover (though this is somewhat obscure),
no dividend may be paid till the ss. in the £ is
paid off. The next table shows the progress made in
that matter, which thus becomes of the utmost im-
portance to shareholders with a hunger for divi-
dends :—-

Next March another 9d. in the £ will be paid, which
will carry the total repaid to 7s. 3d. in the £. See-
ing that the troubles came 20 years ago, and that
even the present arrangement dates from 1897, this
looks pretty slow progress ; but there have been one
or two modifications and changes which have expe-
dited the payments of late years. And the speed will
be all the greater now that it is not considered
necessary to write off any more profits to cover depre-
ciation or the shrinkage of bubble values. As the first
table shows, the amount written off used to greatly
exceed the amount available for repaying depositors.
Of course the amount applied to the repayment of
depositors is written off, too ; but it isn’t a visible
writing off. At the outset it was said—“We owe
this much money which is not represented by assets.”
The debt and the nominal assets were thus swept off
the balance-sheet. The money is, therefore, being
used to get rid of a dead horse —or, at any rate, a
horse that was believed to be thoroughly dead. After
March there will be 12s. 9d. in the £ still to pay.
That means (say) £667,000 altogether. During the
past 12 months £72,338 of profit has been available
for. the purpose. At that rate, and with the bit in
hand, the repayment would be completed in nine
years. Whether anything will happen to retard or to
expedite the business this paper doesn’t know. It
suspects, however, that the bank could, if it liked,
show larger profits; but it seems to be wisely de-
termined to provide itself with an internal contin-
gency fund wherewith to meet the next trouble when
it arrives in Queensland.
The next table shows how the old trouble stands
now:—

The old debt to Government is represented by prom-
issory notes, the first of which needn’t be paid for
six years if the bank cares to dawdle. The old de-
positors got 15s. in the £ in interminable inscribed
stock. When you buy £1 worth of this stock you
buy, of course, its proportion of the unpaid ss. in
the £ previously referred to.

Some of the figures look really very remarkable
especially those relating to deposits and liquid assets’
But they are not quite as remarkable as they look
The Q.N. is banker to the Queensland Government’
and it so happened that at the end of the year the
Government had £1,571,586 on deposit—no doubt
money just borrowed by the State, and to be soon used
to Pay either an old debt or some new creditors.
StilJ, m 10 years the private deposits have grown
from £1,133,614 to £4,825,923 ; and that is re-
markable enough. The holding of so large a propor-
tion of Government money swells the liquid balance,
of course; but, even apart from that, the position
is and has been for many years past very strong. In-
dependent of the old debts, the bank owes £6,919,371.
Strike off £1,857,538 of Government money, Com-
monwealth and State. That leaves £5,061,833.
total £4,394,568. Deduct the
£1,857,038 of Government m0ney —£2,537,030 re-
mains Thus, after putting by 20s. in the £ in
cash to provide for the Government deposits, the
Q.N. still has 58 p.c. of its other liabilities repre-
?. er T ( y. .by hquid assets. That is to say, the other
liabilities which can be called for; the old debts
can t be.
The paid capital is £413,591. The shareholders
may have to wait a good many years more before
they get a taste, and, of course, if anything bad
should happen to Queensland they would run a good
chance not only of losing their present paid capital,
but also of being requested to pay up the uncalled
£2 per share. But, given fair luck and good man-
agement, there is a fine time ahead of them when
the old lumber has been shifted. Especially in
good, brisk times it will be a beautiful thing to have
over £3,000,000 of interminable deposit money at
3 p.c. But the shareholders’ risks incidental to pro-
tecting jiu that borrowed money will always be big.

a progressive concern, which puts the case for the
professional trustee with great force and great per-
sistency. And its arguments, coupled with its re-
cord, are doing their work; in the past 10 years the
estates in the co.’s care has moved on from
£6,600,000 to £9.800,000. The due performance of
the work which the co. undertakes is guaranteed bv
a paid capital of £90,000, and reserves, which now
amount to £50,058, are growing rapidly These
figures are very substantial, and it is plain that the
management intends that the reserves, at any rate
s , hall . i b , e a lot more substantial still. The funds
(capital and reserves) are for the most part in public
securities (£59,845), city freehold (£60,000), and
cash. There are no liabilities ; the co. does not risk
anybody s money but its own, and it puts even its
own mto things where the risks look smallest, so
that the entire funds may be available for safeguard-
ing clients interests. Not, of course, that a trustee
guarantees a trust estate against all loss ; but it does
guarantee it against loss resulting from such things
as the misreading of a will, or from investments that
are improper in the eye of the law, or from the dis-
°f,^he trustee’s servants, etc. This guarantee
is one of the co. s risks—not a very large risk as a
.. , e ; when the value of securities tends upwards, but
liable to be occasionally serious when values slump
and a beneficiary doesn’t get what he expected from
an estate. Hovvever, from the shareholders’ point of
S . th ®J lS il isn * ver .y large, given good manage-
ment , and the return is excellent. Last half-ylar
showed just over 14 p.c. p.a. on the capital, though
that was certainly something extra. In duller times the
earnings won t be so good, because estates won’t be
Z rth n^ n T h , and * he commissions will be less ;on
the other hand, the constant growth of trustee
cos. busmess will be a factor in keeping the profits
steady even under adverse circumstances. There is
not a big scope for investment in trustee cos.’ stock •
but considering the nature of the securities in which
offer a better Sn. PUt ’ are feW thin * s that

The paid capital is now £20,000, reserves to the
amount to £5OOO having been added to it since the end
of the previous half-year. Ten p.c. is, therefore, now
equal to 134 p.c. on the old capital. The co. has just
finished its 25th year, and the officers get a birthday
present of £257, which has been deducted from the
profits. The business looks solid, and there is no
reason to doubt the future. Estates in hand show an
increase of over 60 p.c. in seven years, and, though
Ballarat and district don’t grow as they should, more
and more people with estates to leave behind them
will certainly give the work of administration to
professional executors with a permanent establish-
ment- The trouble with the private trustee, no
matter how good he may be, is that his trust dies
with him. Sometimes he dies before the testator, and
that is bad enough ; sometimes he dies shortly after-
wards, and that is worse. Besides, a co. like this
has capital and reserves (including uncalled capital)
to guarantee that the testator’s cash won’t get un-
fortunately mixed with the trustee’s. The capital
and reserves in this case are almost wholly repre-
sented by public securities and cash, and you can’t
have anything safer than that.

This co. is in the loan business, and, on paper, makes
a very good thing out of it. Besides its own capi-
tal it has £312,324 of other people’s, and practi-
cally the whole jot of it is invested in “mortgages
and other securities.” The following shows the
position in more detail:—
1902. 1910. 1911. 1912.
Capital and reserves £131,492 £156,035 £159,144 £lBl,BOl

Book debts .. .. 4,691 5,484 5,697 6,097
Liquid assets .. 15,798 18,262 11,000 8,500
For a good many years past the paid capital has
been a trifle over £lOO,OOO. Lately it was wisely
decided to issue another 4750 shares of £lO each,
calling up £5 by quick instalments; and the pre-
mium on this issue has been transferred to reserves.
This makes the proportion of shareholders’ funds to
liabilities look much better. The cash position is
still very weak. Presumably the co. has an
arrangement with some bank in case there should
be a sudden call for money. No doubt deposits are
not taken except for fixed terms; but, even so, there
are times when in order to preserve its credit a
deposit co. can’t afford to point to the letter of the
bond. Whether the eo.’s “mortgages and other
securities” are good or only middling, this paper
can’t pretend to know. The return is satisfactory,
running to an average of just about 6 p.e. ; but, un-
fortunately, that is no criterion, as everybody is
aware who followed the Melbourne land-mortgage
banks just before they collapsed.

Take a line from “Pyrmont wharves, mill, etc.” Six
years ago this asset was valued at £15,900. Some
of the property may have been sold since then; but
it is more certain that additions have been made. Six
months ago the directors admitted that £l6OO had
just been spent on further wharfage accommodation,
Yet to-dav the whole thing is in at £4500. It is
pretty evident, then, that in addition to the profits
shown in the first table, considerable sums have been
made and dropped into assets that don’t appear in the
balance-sheet. And this paper isn’t going to throw
any bricks at the management for doing it. Trade
in timber has of late been quite abnormal. Not only
is there a market handy for every stick the men in
the business can produce, but prices have been got
which it is safe to say very few people in the trade
ever expected to see. No doubt exes, have gone up
and threaten to go up still more; but the margin is
a , v ? ry w^e one - This boom-time prodigality
will not last; and the co. that can tuck a bit away,
and so put itself in a better position to meet
trouble by and bye, is very wise. In the second table
printed above it is mentioned that cash, etc., amounts
to £17,9/3. But this doesn’t include everything
The items, as mentioned, are taken from the balance-
sheet; ana this co. adopts the rather unusual practice
ot excluding the insurance and reserve fund from the
b c a a o nC o e o n she - et n A s , fund > which now amounts to
£lB,OOO, is all in deposits or saleable shares. Add
that to the £17,973, and we have £35,973 liquid
7? IS , a '} c L the A rge quantity of semi-liquid assets
(book debts, etc.) add to the value of the 10 p c
dividend ; for it is one thing to get 10 p.c. from' a
trading co. with large liquid assets, and quite another
thing to get the same return from another co. whose
capital is largely represented by intangible goodwill
and other assets, whose value depends mainly upon
the prosperity of the business.

That gives a general view of the business; but a few
words of explanation are necessary. The profit shown
above is on working account, with interest charged
against the balance. The working account does not
of course, include the interest earnings of the sinking-
funds, nor of the reserve fund either. The whole
earnings can be put this way:—

Reserves include sinking fund. (Sinking funds,
£25,604 ; reserve fund, £8359 ; total, £33,963.
Less P. and L. debit, £272—leaving £33,691 as
above.) The primary object of the reserve fund is
to renew the plant as it becomes necessary ; that of
the sinking fund is to provide means to repay the
borrowed money, and thus enable the municipality to
presently actually own the undertaking, free of debt.
The fixed loans (from Government mostly) now
amount to £163,909, and there is about £4500 of
an overdraft (the corporation finances this). The
sinking fund contribution is thus approximately 1
p.c. ; and the sinking fund is a sinking fund, inas-
much as it is credited with its own earnings. The
fund is invested apart from the business. Assuming
that it can earn an average of 4 p.c., it will repay
the debt in about 44 years. So far all is very satis-
factory. The only other point to consider is whether
enough is being provided as a set-off against depre-
ciation ; and though maintenance and renewals thus
far have been charged up with working expenses,
there is some doubt as to whether general deprecia-
tion is being fully provided for. On that point the
Launceston people ought to make sure. If sufficient
provision is not made, it seems probable that a trifle
more revenue ought to be got in. The margin is cer-
tainly none too wide. For instance, the net earnings
(apart from interest) were last year £4507, whereas
the amount formally written off last year was £4595.
If £4595 was a fair thing to write off, then the
revenue ought to be a trifle greater—or the working
exes, ought to be a trifle less.
The next list shows the growth of the business and
the average price charged for current (lighting and
power combined) :

The figures showing the remarkable growth of the
business suggest pretty strongly that Launceston is
finding the tiger of Socialism a very satisfactory
animal indeed. And the remarkably low average
price charged supplies the reason. The Bulletin's
only doubt is_ whether it is not a trifle too low to

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing] a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and Which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

In all smithing work high-class iron can be mote
safely manipulated at varying temperatures than
steel or ordinary iron. It is for this reason that
Best Yorkshire Farnley Iron is preferred by engi-
neers, where toughness, great strength and close
grain are needed. Whatever the specification, Iron
of the Farnley type does not vary, but is simply the
best that can be produced from what is really
wrought iron. “Farnley” Bars of all sections sup-

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed ’64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yejt gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be slad to forward particulars.* [1

been compared with the Yankee’s Alaska Treadwell
which crushed 79,436 tons last September for ar!
average of 10s. per top, and made a profit of £15,702.
There was a time when Broken Ilill and
Charters Towers were put on about the same plane
as mining fields; and the Towers still bulks large in
the market reports. But consider the dividends paid
last year—Charters Towers, £36,548; Broken Hill
£1,529,41/. Broken Hill thus pays nearly as much
per week as the Towers paid for the 12 months And
of the £36,548 paid in divs. £36,028 was required
back in calls.
* * * *
The fight of Melbourne to regain control
of the Broken Hill Junction North isn’t finished yet,
and it is promised that the ructions to come won’t
have been equalled since poor old Hogan shook Hal
Shepherd out of the co. There isn’t a great differ-
ence in the Melbourne and Sydney share registers
The tipster doesn’t know where he is; for, though
the “ins” have an advantage, calls and faces running
into mullock don’t tend to make shareholders pleasant
and contented.
Bullrush (W.A.) now considers it bad
business to distribute its Kyarra holding in broken
bits among shareholders, and proposes to hang on to
it instead. To divide up the scrip in mostly five, 10
and 15 share lots would have a bad effect on the mar-
ket, sav the controllers. Small, untidy parcels are
generally hard to trade in, and sometimes can’t be
dealt with at all.
* * * *
Edna Mav (W.A.) has just recovered over
£6OOO from 600 tons, and its supporters are talking
about a great future. According to the latest report,
220 ft. of driving lms been done in payable ore at
70ft., and the face is estimated to be worth an ounce
for a width of Bft. : Oft. of solid high-grade ore is
also staled to be showing in a winze sunk 23ft. below
this level, auu the dip of the shoot is alleged to be
becoming mure vertical.
* * * *
As the mutilated Workers’ Comnensation
Act, passed last month by the Westralian Parliament,
allows the conditions affecting tributes to remain as
before. North Kalgurli (W.A.) has withdrawn its
threat to lock up what is left of its ore-bearing
ground, and is now letting in lots to suit lease-
holders.
* * • *
Westralia Mount Morgans (W.A.) is not
dead, but sleepeth. Leastways, its present owners
say so. About half a million tons of accumulated
residues are being re-treated, and the funds derived
from this, together with what can be made out of
the extraction of a quantity of ore left under the
foundations of the old mill, are expected to be suffi-
cient to make a fresh start underground. Thousands
and thousands of tons of ore which weren’t formerly
considered payable, are alleged to be in sight, and
with new ways and means of cheapening treatment,
are expected to prove very profitable. So far, how-
ever, everything is based on vague anticipation.
Ingliston Extended (W.A.) reports that
the gross result of the past financial year’s work was
a surplus of £1514. Depreciation ( £1416) re-
duces this credit to £9B. Recent developments at
depth are declared to have been “extremely satisfac-
tory.”
Greenfinch (W.A.) announces a small
revenue for December, and remarks that it has pur-
chased 300 tons of sands, which should show a good
profit. It also opines that the future depends en-
tirely on the shoot going down ; but as the future of
every other mine is dependent on the same thing,
there is nothing very informative in this.
* * * *
Last financial year Ida H. (W.A.) pro-
duced £36,173 ; but the bulk of the surplus ( £7614)
was expended in unprofitable development, and a
halance of £lBBB was carried forward. The payable-
part of the mine has been opened at the 11th level,
where, as this paper predicted, the shoot is shorter
than in the level above. The co. still holds a big wad
of shares in a Nigerian tin venture; but, although
«ome tin is being unearthed from it, some doubts
have been cast on the accuracy of the official esti-
mates of values, so the Board refrains from put-
ting a value on the holding.
* * * *
North White Feather’s condition is very
precarious. The main reef in this Westralian weak-
ling lost its values some time ago, and as supplies of'
ore obtained from other sources were insufficient to
keep the mill going, the co. shut down and let the-
mine on tribute. There are now 13 parties working,
but results have not been very remunerative.
*,* * *
A 16 months’ statement of accounts pre-
sented at the Hannans’ Reward meeting showed that
32,688 tons of low-grade stuff were treated during
that period for a return of £19,300. A working
profit of £317 was made, but depreciation, etc., con-
vert this credit into a debit of £37. The chairman,
nevertheless, announced that the position was better-
than it was a year ago. Then the co. had an over-
draft, whereas it now has a credit balance of over-
£4oo.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) has lately
been at the top of the class. In driving on the new
shoot at the No. 4 level in its Ora Banda show,
values went from good to better. From 31ft. to-
66ft. they averaged 645. per ton over a width of about
sft. From 66ft. to 95ft. they increased to 825., and!
from 95ft. to 130 ft. the average has been, approxi-
mately. £l2. Shares have moved along, and by the-
time the manager’s supplementary report, forecast-
ing increased profits and other things, is read at the-
annual meeting on the 29th, they will probably have-
moved still further.
* * * *
Altogether 33.680 tons were extracted from
Oroya Links (W.A.) during the third quarter of
1912. Total receipts (including £240 from roval-
ties) amounted to £39.958. Exnenditure absorbed'
£31,473. leaving a working surplus of £8485. A
good deal of rising and winzing was done during the
neriod, and considerable additions are alleged to have
been made to the reserves in consequence. Since the
end of the quarter the lode has been followed down
to 64ft. below the 750 ft. level, and values are re-
ported to average 40s. for a width of 24ft.
* * * *
Nothing very important transpired at the-
Kalgurli meeting. Towards the close of the pro-
ceedings Edward Hooper, of Hooper and Sneak, a
newlv-elected member of the Board, was asked to tell
shareholders something about the mine. He said'
that the manager had very clearly set out the posi-
tion in his annual report. As the bottom workings
looked dicky, developments were being pushed ahead!
in the upper levels, where quite a number of over-
looked shoots had been discovered. It was formerly
a question of ounces; now it was one of dwts. The
Kalgurli, he said, could not be compared with the
lvannoe or Golden Horseshoe or the Boulder, because
they were on a different line of reef. He was not
Die to put a value on the reserves, as the ore in the
,u ,a f erra f* c in value. The manager told
nem that there was a large tonnage, but he could not
say whether it was worth 7dwt. or lOdwt. The
manager, however, was a most cautious man, and when
ne stated that th.ere were 250,000 tons in sight, he
sure that tLey might look upon the
actual quantity as being very much larger.
. A L annual meeting the position
star Explorations, Ltd., was described as
lavorable, but it was admitted that the dividend
stage was not yet in sight. All the co.’s accumulated
Lauings at Kalgoorlie have now been re-treated, and
efforts are being made to dispose of the extraction
plant to the best advantage. Shareholdings, made up
principally of Nigerian tin ventures, were increased
'? j? ex tent of £4OOO during the year, and since
the directors annual report was prepared, an expedi-
tion, headed by Trewartha James, has gone out to
examine some tin and silver-lead shows in the back-
°l the - sa ™ e countr -y. The co. still holds
26,952 shares in the Mountain Queen and 47,461 in
the Lake View and Star, and when the last mail left
Lionel on it was nibbling’ at a tin property in Swazi-
land and a hydraulicing tin area in Malay States.
„ “Bar One”: Re Great Boulder, “Bar
None (26/12/ 12) says the management worked hon-
estly and not for market purposes. Well, I didn’t
say that it was dishonest. I simply stated that it
is not as good as “the man in the street” thinks.
A management can be honest, and yet no good. As
to dawdling in prospecting, I’ll prove my case. The
™ a J" Boulder leases are together 3600 ft. long and
720tt. wide (at the north end they are wider) They
are bounded on the west by the Ivanhoe and ’Shoe,
and on the east (for most of the way) by the Per-
severance and Lake View. All the workings on the
G.B. are- contained within 220 ft. of the western
boundary’ leaving a length of 3600 ft. by a width of
500 ft. untouched below 200 ft„ except for an oc-
casional borehole. The leaving untouched of a big
area like this might be pardoned if the leases in that
direction were no good ; but, bounded as the Boulder
IS ml ? es hke the “Persy” and Lake View, it is
capable of anything, more especially in view of the dis-
•covery in the former mine lately of two entirely new
lodes. Besides, a bore put out from Hamilton shaft
(unsatisfactory though bores are) cut 6ft. of ore
worth 9dwt„ at the 1800 ft. level. This alone ought
to be worth more prospecting.
* * *
IL Id. Rowe and the fat directors of the
Long Tunnel, Walhalla, are not shutting up the mine
without a protest from the little town. No call has
been made on shareholders for years, and thev seem
so unaccustomed to part up that they can think of
nothing but liquidation. That would mean a final
dividend to the fat majority, but it wouldn’t give the
•corpse a chance. Rowe, when telling of the small
amount of work done by miners, could not see that
he was smudging the management as well as the
workers. If men don’t render fair service, the
proper thing to do is to trv someone else. Slack
; management appears to have been a failing with the
co. Anyway, Walhalla wants to try whether the
shallow ground round the old South Long Tunnel is
not worth a go, and it would dearly like to do some
work off the old vertical shaft. These are the
quarters at which prospecting should have been car-
ried on long since, but there wasn’t the grit avail-
able on the Board to pull out on to a new track.
If the co. had not been allowed to shepherd the old
South Long Tunnel, the probability is that that claim
would have been at work to-day, instead of also drift -
ing to the dust bin. The State Government was so
alarmed at the result of the meeting that it hustled
off geologists Herman and Baragwanath to save the
situation. But they will have a poor crowd to deal
with.
* * * *
“Scarcity of efficient miners” was men-
tioned by the chairman of the Long Tunnel as one
reason for discontinuing development work, and
closing up the old mine. “A party of six miners,
provided with rock drills, explosives, and everything
necessary to do good work, took four weeks to sink
an exploratory winze (7ft. x 4ft.) to a depth of
14ft.” More recently “a party of six miners working
on contract in the stopes, broke and raised more
quartz in a week than 20 miners did working on
wages under similar conditions.” Men who pursue
a Go Slow poliev at the expense of a tottering mine
which had swallowed up £12,000 in the past 12
months are in urgent need of some serious talking
to. That way lies national bankruptcy.
* * * *
Central Plateau, Sebastopol (Vic.), has
turned out better than was expected with the work
it has done in the Albion lode, though the mine
is not yet the big pot the market would indicate.
When a bit of gold is got, Ballarat never fails to
make the pace warm. So out comes a litter of
pups, with the usual mining genealogy to charm the
"•ndgeons. The last little stranger is the Central
Plateau Extended, which cla ; ms to have over 2500 ft.
on the line of the Albion lode. The gentle fact is
flirted out that the bulk of the Sebastopol Plateau
e-old came from the Consols and Guiding Star lodes.
Exactly; but this doesn’t mean that the shoots extend
into the parallel Albion formation. If they did, a
lot of the work done by the Star of the East on
that lode would not have been so patchy. Still, the
unexpected has already happened at the Central
Plateau, and it is in the pot of Fate that a double
may be struck at the Extended.
* * * *
Central Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), blooms
as its neighbor, North Nuggetty, wilts. Of course
the flip-out of “Bill” Gullick from the North Nug’s
management didn’t help that co., although it led to
the disclosure of some personal views respecting the
crowd who transplanted North Nuggetty from Bal-
larat to Queen-street. The truth is, chairman Rain
was right when he measured up the mine. There
was only a limited quantity of good stone in sight,
with a truckload of possibilities ahead. At the half-
yearly meeting Gullick hung on to the possibilities,
perhaps to help him hang on to his job. However,
though some of the possibilities have been blown out,
there is more than a shade of hope that the work
which is being done on the beupdarv will r>nin+
way to better things. Even with that given in, North
Nuggetty -sn’t a 30s. stock by a long way on present
developments. #
Mount Elliott (Q.) comes along with an-
other 10s., making the total dividends 525. per
share. The past six months has been the most pro-
fitable period in the history of the mine. The out-
put of blister was 3535 tons. Reckoning 3500 tons
of pure metal, an average of £BO per ton makes
£288,000 gross value. It would seem from this
that a quarterly distribution of £75,000 (10s. per
share) is a heavy strain. To the end of last year
’Elliott had produced 14,155 tons of copper; but
this brilliant work has been at the expense of ore
reserves, and the management has been developing
the Hampden Consols and several outside shows in
order to strengthen the position. So far, none of
the new mines can be compared to Mount Elliott s
shallow levels as they looked when the mine was
very carefully prepared for a stoping campaign.

The Lass o’ Gowrie, near Stannary Hills
(Q.j, has been for years noted for rich shoots of
tin ore, and frequently the mill returns have been
over 2 0 p.c. Recently it was determined to attack
the deep levels by tunnelling, and, as a result, a lode
2ft. wide has been exposed for a length of 54ft.
°f the assays give 50 p.c. metallic tin over a
width of 18in., with 6in. of ore on one side heavily
charged with arsenical pyrites. Tin lodes are so
patcny that prosuects ahead of the pick are very
speculative, but the Lass o’ Gowrie appears likely to
open a shoot of ore.
During last year 135,981 tons were
crushed at Charters Towers for £428,362; average.
£3 Is. 6d. per ton. The mill returns for the year
amounted to £227,308, the balance coming from
concentrates and tailings. So, generally speaking,
the battery treatment saves slightly less than half
the gold recovered. Cyanide does most of the rest.
The Brilliant P.G., Charters Towers, con-
tinues to sink the main underlay shaft below the
1596 ft. level on the Day Dawn formation. The
deepest level, near the bottom of the shaft, is No. 3,
and the western end in the direction of the New
Brilliant Freehold has lately carried a large reef
from 2ft. to 3Rt. wide of mineralised stone. This
co. also owns the Stockholm, and prospects in No. 12
east the deepest level—-show a substantial improve-
ment. There is the big swag of 260,000 shares.
Brilliant Block, Charters Towers, has
asked the Queensland Government for a subsidy. The
prospecting work on the Day Dawn formation and
the long crosscut in search of the Brilliant Deeps'
reef have used up nearly all the available cash. It
is likely that the co. will get a lift. The prompti-
tude with which the Papuan Co. returned a bor-
rowed £5OO sweetened up the Department with
regard to the Towers. A mutual agreement has been
arrived at by the Brilliant and Brilliant Block. The
former, now that the ventilation has been improved,
will extend No. 4 level into the Blocks’ lease some
400 ft., and the Blocks will sink an underlay shaft
some distance below the Deeps’ No. 4 level. It is
expected that 700 ft. of sinking and 400 ft. of driving
will connect the workings of the two cos. The
Deeps will pay a portion of the cost. A large reef
was left near the Blocks’ boundary, and the continua-
tion of the level will be of considerable interest to
Blocks shareholders.

“Inky”: Melbourne expects to have a
second evening paper on June 1 next, the Sun
Newspaper Co. having been registered with a capital
of £150,000, in 150,000 shares of £1 each. The
five subscribers of one share each who signed the"
memorandum of association are connected with Rep.
Agar Wynne’s firm of solicitors. It is understood
that most of the capital will be supplied by Sydney
investors, though it is suspected that H. IT Denison
brought back from abroad a bag full of Harmsworth
money. The Herald has been getting ready for its
expected rival for a long time past, and the Whole
staff is busy taking tablets which cure sleeping sick-
ness.

It is reported from London that manager
H. P. Barry has asked the Waihi (M.L.) directors
to relieve him of his job. He has had 17 years of it,
and, in the very much altered state of things, can’t
find it comfortable now. The chances are that Cap-
tain Richard, late of Mount Morgan, will be asked to
step across the Tasman Sea. The copper proposition
that Morgan has turned into was, quite naturally,
too much for Richard ; but Waihi’s is a gold propo-
sition, and Richard is quite at home there.

The Queensland Insurance Co., which
came as a stranger to Melbourne some 34 years ago,
has now carried its increasing business into a mighty
fine building of its own in William-street, near
Collins-street. The seven-storeved structure, with its
300 windows, is the pride of manager F. H. Holland,
and it stands for up-to-dateness in all its bearings.
The exterior is strikingly handsome, and the interior
—claimed to be fireproof throughout—is about
everything that a houseful of offices ought to be.
The Queensland Insurance Co. takes the basement and
half the ground floor ; the other half is occupied by
Burns, Philp and Co.

From Frank Bayston, secretary: Re
“Enquirer’s” query (B. 19/12/T2). I have been
secretary of the Iron, Steel and Metals Manufacturing
Co., Limited, since October, 1911, and I unhesita-
tingly say the statement made by “Enquirer,” “that
the office neither answers nor acknowledges inquiries,
and that no information can be obtained,” is abso-
lutely incorrect, if he is referring to the period since
the date mentioned. If “Enquirer” or any other
shareholder wants any information, all he need do is
to write to me and a reply will be sent immediately.
Tongkah Compound has sprung into favor
since it purchased additional dredging ground in
Siam ; and scarcity of scrip has sent the market soar-
ing. Last month’s return was 66| tons of tin oxide from
60,000 cubic yards of dirt; average, 2.41 b. per cubic
yard. But the yield is a heap more variable than
even the metal market. For instance, in June,
60,500 cubic yards gave 36 tons of oxide, and in
April, 58,000 cubic yards returned 32 tons, or an
average of just half that recorded last month. The
price of the metal on January 3 was £229 55., com-
pared with £l9l a year previously. Yields may
be even higher for a while ; but there isn’t much to
show that even the present rate will last for long.
Maoriland mining s~ Aculators will not
easily forget 1912. Among mines in the Auckland
Province, Talisman dropped from 495. to 365.,
Waihi from 575. to 335., Grand Junctions from 295.
9d. to 225. 3d. And the old Thames field became
even smaller potatoes than it had been just previ-
ously, its output dwindling to about £4OOO a
month.
“Wandi” : A ’possum-farming co., it is re-
ported, has been formed in London with a capital
of £50,000. The promotor is A. le Soeuf, of
W.A., brother of the director of Sydney Zoo. A
large area of country, said to be rocky and useless
for any other purpose, has been secured. The carry-
ing capacity is estimated at only 10 ’possums per
acre. Still, with seven females and three bucks,
and assuming an increase of seven per annum, the
value at present price of skins would be £3 10s.
per acre. Several settlers in N.S.W. embarked in
the ’possum industry two or three years ago, but I
have not heard anything of their operations since.
In many parts of this State, and in southern parts of
Queensland, ’possum farming should be a paying busi-
ness The little animals only want the trees, and
ordinary stock could be pastured as usual. Thus
big-timbered grass country could be made doubly
productive. * * *
The Ulladulla Refrigerating Butter Co.,
one of the multitude of small co-operative concerns
on the N.S.W. Cow-coast, paid its usual modest 5
p c div for the year. The latter six months were
not very profitable, owing to increased freights, etc.,
and a few pounds had to come out of the reserves to
pay the div. Depreciation is, however, charged for
in the accounts; in this respect these little concerns
are much more honest than a lot of big ones. The
position looks quite sound. Liabilities total £2207:
cash and assets apart from plant and land are valued
at £3464, and they are no doubt worth that or but
very little less. #
“Rimu”: The Auckland (M.L.) ship
canal project, bv which it is proposed to connect
Manakau harbor on the west with the mam eastern
port of Waitemata at a cost of £1,250,000, is not
altogether the thrilling proposition its backers would
have us suppose. It is suggested that the sea dis-
tance between Auckland and Wellington may, by this
means, be shortened by 21 hours, as compared with the
sea distance between port and port on the eastern
coast run, that Auckland and Sydney may be brought
four hours closer, and that the coal mines at Westport
and Greymouth can be brought within a stone s
throw, so to speak. This is all right for vessels of
shallow draught, such as rafts, punts, motor-launches
and the like; but the real trouble with Manakau
Harbor is its particularly ugly bar. The isthmus •*.
a narrow one, and Onehunga, on the Manakau, is
practically one of the western suburbs of Auckland.
Had there been no bar to contend with, the big ship-
ping would have gone to that side all along, and
Auckland would simply have rolled over on its elbow
and had its main business buildings where Onehunga
now stands. How a canal is going to enable vessels
of large draught to cross that wicked bar is not evi-
dent. However, Private Enterprise is taking the job
in hand.
Apropos the outcry against Australian
taxation and its effect in “driving capital out of the
country.” The S’African Union has for a good while
past been collecting a 10 p.c. tax on profits. The De
Beers Co.’s little payment on this account in its last
financial year amounted to £365,000, and there was
no official growling about it either.
A Bit: A profit of £3O was made with
copper at £6O. But if copper has gone to £65 it
doesn’t follow that the profit is £35, because of the
recent increase in the price of timber, stores, etc. In
fact, in spite of the rise in price of copper, the profit
might now be less than the old £3O C.M.: Hang
on G.H.T.: Can’t advise you that way. The
Bulletin said what it thought of the eo. in “Wild
Cat,” 14/11/’l2.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 20, 1913.
My Dear Arini.—
Mrs. Sydney Burdekin’s death, .after a
long illness, removes one of the most pictur-
esque personalities from local society. The
romantic story of her girlhood, her marriage
with the wealthy Sydney Burdekin, and her
beauty and personal charm, made the late
Mrs. Burdekm stand out from the social
nock. Her first social success is said to
have dated from the days when, as Mayoress
ot Sydney, she lifted a commonplace posi-
tion out of the ruck, and set a pace the
average aldermanic dame has not attempted
since. She was shrewd and far-seeing in
business, and her sense of line and color was
demonstrated in the eternal fitness of her
cfothes.
Satin-skinned carriage horses pawed the
load outside St. James’s Church last Thurs-
K ™ hlla fiends and relatives of the late
Irs. Burdekin met there for the memorial
service. An open landau full of the white
blooms scented the whole street. Many of
the friends were too far away on summer
jaunts to get to town in time for the fun-
-7f, a la fS e assembly of those within
reach of the city made a pilgrimage to the
last sad function. One son and a daughter
(the pretty Mrs. Allison) died before their
mother She passed out in the country
home of her daughter, Mrs. Alec Hay
Mrs. Catherine Toohey, widow of James
of the big brewery firm, died at
Strathfield the other day. The late J. M.
ioohey was a one-time representative of
South Sydney in the Legislative Assembly.

stacks of seats, and looked for his lost num-

down, and waited to be turned out of his
wrong place, and propelled into the right
place by the official pilot.

made a brave show like lines of half-ripe
strawberries. In the western stand, Woman
merely peeled at the back of her neck, and
saw the game in more comfort.
?- 6W u st ra ii an stamp is pursued bv
maledictions. It is a feeble sketch of k
desert peopled by a hump-backed and for-
lorn kangaroo. Even the color has a pov-
erty-stricken look of having been watered
to its present sickly hue, owing, perhaps, to
the original pink pigment having run out of
stock. An over-boiled shrimp in a dead
faint might match its wilted blush. Aus-
«!hi lla f 1S lookil lf for the person respon-

accused of the crime. The defendant author-
ised a firm reply: “Not guilty.”
Artist .Toe Wolinski and his sister Zara
leave for London m the Maloja on January

street. has sent out invitations for a fare-
well bun in their honor. This will have

Otherwise he may have to place it there bv

available for publication. He merely says
that he found time, in between his aquatic
pursuits, to get some sketches of the local
drought.
“^ ic 4 k ” Teece, general manager of the
great A.M.P. Society, followed his women-
folk to England. It may be a business trip ;
11 ur’ the ob j ect hasn’t been given to the
public. The chances are that he wants to
have a last look at the new English business
ot the society before his retirement, which
can tbe far off now. Though he doesn’t look
it, Mr. Teece is just verging on 67. The
most notable send-off was at the New South
W ales Club, where the supposedly-unimag-
inative man of figures took the lid off his
eloquence, and made a speech which aston-
ished the friends who didn’t know he was an
orator.
Cadorin,. a Venetian sculptor now in Syd-
ney, has. joined in the Shakspeare ter-cen-
tenary discussion. He suggests a group re-
in bas-relief some scene typical
of the best that Will could do in dramatic
episode. It is also hinted that Mr.
Cadorin would be a suitable person to pro-
duce the group. A suggestion that it should
adorn a new wing of the Mitchell Library,
which should be christened The Shakspeare
and fed with Elizabethan literature, finds
some supporters.
Mr. Cadorin is the husband of Lovie
Mueller the Bendigo singer—a daughter of
Ernest Mueller, who did well out of mines in
that poppet-headed town. She toured Aus-
tralia with Kubelik, and went on to Russia
as the soprano of the company. Another
Bendigo girl, Emily Dyason, was the pianist
ot the Bohemian fiddler’s golden trek through
this country. She was not included in the
Cossack tour. Later on, the two young
women met and lived together in Vienna.
Now the singer comes back to show her
native land to her Venetian sculptor-hus-
band.
With Christmas greetings, artist Arthur
Mreeton sends word from Rouen that he
will probably take another trip to his Aus-
traiian homeland early this year.
Miss Daisy Willsallen’s friends report an
understanding with Mr. Sydney Whyam
second engineer on 11.M.5. Drake. The girl
is tbe younger daughter of the late Mr. Tom
\\ lllsallen, the wealthy N.S.W. grazier whose
flocks and herds fed on many hills and
plains.
Until a few youngsters now in tliq school-
room grow into long skirts, Sydney is likelv
to suiter from a mild drought of moneyed
maidens. The just-departing commission of
naval frill has almost cleared this port of
girls with cash or “prospects.” In marry-
mg Gold, it made a record which has beaten
all its predecessors. The Drakes got away
with solid helpings of Australian heiress,
and the smaller boats did fairly well, also.
A story with a shabby ending is alleged
to refer to one of the noble water-fowl He
became engaged to a very pretty Sydney girl
who was still in her blushing teens. It was
apparently, an accident of the kind that
sometimes trips, the dowry hunter at the first
hurdle. The girl’s name was the same as
that of an outrageously wealthy family. She
lived in a fashionable suburb, and had sur-
roundings that indicated much money on the
Then the wily bird discovered
that his young duck’s plumage was not
streaked with golden feathers. So he re-
voked* and hearts were no longer trumps.
In plain and simple language, he told the
maiden fair that he thought they wouldn’t
be able, to manage, etc. This happy release
of a nice girl from the clutch of a mere
money-grabber is not followed by the tears
of her friends. Later, the gentleman may
have a fierce desire to kick himself at least
twice. The girl has a wealthy and aged
grandparent in England, who is quite likely
to leave her a cosy nest-egg—but not with-
out running a legal barbed-wire around it.
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Farquhar, of Thurs-
day Island, returned to Torres Straits by
the Empire yesterday. Mr. Farquhar’s
pearling fleet is responsible for one-fifth of
the shell raised in Torres. Said he: “We
only dive for shell now. That is to say, the
shell is ours, but as the Jap divers had a fine
ability in lifting the pearls before the shell
was brought from the luggers to the store-
ship, we made a virtue of necessity, and we
buy the pearls which we used to be robbed
of. But we get more shell now per lugger
than we used to do.”
Mrs. Farquhar is trying to reconcile State
law with the Commonwealth’s White Aus-
tralia legislation. “In Papua,” she said,
“there are schools for white children and
separate schools for the blacks. At Thurs-
day Island, under the State education law,
they are all mixed up together—white and
black and colored. We in the Straits believe
in White Australia more than most south-
erners. because we’ve lived among the
colored people, and we have to send our
children, to school in the south and lose their
companionship. There was a deputation to
the Queensland Premier of the time—Mr.
Kidston, I think it was then —to ask for a
separate school for white children, but we
were refused it because the Government
thought it might lead to international com-
plications. But the Commonwealth has
separate schools in Papua, and there are no
international complications up to now.”
Mrs. A. C. Buchanan and three daugh-
ters left for Europe in the Demosthenes.
They will enjoy a travelling vacation of two
years or so, and then come home for a
holiday.
Sydney’s 1913 Mayor Cocks will preside
at the farewell dinner to organist Arthur
Mason. This revel will be served up with
valedictory remarks at Paris House on
February 14. Mr. Mason’s pen flows with
graphic descriptive matter, and he’s going
to dive into the inky way in London. His
rounded periods in special articles to the
S. M. Herald made new bones of conten-
tion in crochetty circles here. But the style
was delightful. The long-haired profession
wishes the writer well in his coming re-
invasion of Fleet-street.
The employees of George Robertson and
Co. gathered themselves togetb*'' - in < ~ *
place the other day to farewell Mr. P.
Morris, who goes to Melbourne to manage
the business affairs of another firm. Con-
cerning the Robertsons, an old inhabitant
tells me this: “It is GO years ago since
George Robertson established himself in Mel-
bourne in a little shop in Collins-street near
the Athenaeum, and opposite the Argus
office. In that small beginning of a big
business the foreman salesman was William
Maddocks, who has recently retired from
Dymock’s circulating library. In the ’6o’s
Mr. Maddocks came to Sydney to open a
branch for George Robertson, and eventually
took over the business.” At the time of his
connection with the Melbourne end of the
firm, Air. Mullen founded the first circulating
library in Alelbourne. Now the recently-
farewelled Alorris goes to the southern city
to manage for Melville and Mullen.
The thoughtful behavior of some Lind-
field hydrangea-blossoms is worth a few
cheers. This bloom is usually a fickle
beauty, and apt to fall down dead on very
slight provocation. For once, it held on to
its stalk with extraordinary pertinacity. The
wedding of Miss Mab Sanders, of Lindfield,
and Mr. Cuthbert Parkinson, of Brisbane,
was the occasion. Roses were off, so the
family hopes were centred in the generally
faithless hydrangea for decorative purposes.
Gardeners have a belief that if flowers don’t
answer back, they know more than most
people give them credit for. Anyhow, the
hydrangeas in question stuck to their stalks
and pervaded the rooms as a wedding-day
extra. Next day, however, every blossom
was stark dead, and their blue blooms black
in the face.
The success scored by the Lane Cove
River carnival last year has incited its pro-
moters to try to break their own record
before summer departs. February 1 is fixed
as the date of the next lantern-hung water
revel.
The League of Ancient Mariners has
booked Saturday, February 15, for their
annual reminiscences. It is their habit to
take a bushman’s holiday, and navigate
the harbor on a launch. The midday feast
be spread and surrounded in the naval
depbt at Rushcutters Bay, Commander
Brownlow having kindly lent the glorified
shed for the occasion.
Eugenie Boland, the Toowoomba contralto
who made a dash for Britain seven or eight
years ago, returns in March to see her
Queensland relatives. She will give a con-
cert or two in this city on her way north.
Emilie Lambert, of this port, steps ashore
here sometime in March. She returns as a
mezzo-contralto after some months in the
studio of the famous Bouhy in Paris. He
dubs Emilie “a graceful and accomplished
singer.” That veteran teacher, Charles
Santley, who had the Voice under his charge
for a while in London, seconds the Bouhy
certificate. Landon Ronald, the well-known
English composer, who is Melba’s favorite
accompanist—a task he sometimes under-
takes as a tribute to the Lady of Lilydale—-
showed the Sydney singer extensive courtesy
during her stay in the Great Fog. In
November, by the way, the Fog departed
from its usual habit of being peasoup brown
relieved with yellow spots, and achieved a
profound black. An Australian in London
says it was like getting up in the middle of
the night to eat the breakfast you had for-
gotten yesterday morning.
Schwabe, the pianist who accompanied
Kubelik’s fiddle when it wailed in Australia,
made a few hundred friends in this con-
tinent. He was amiable —an unusual qual-
ity in a trade that works out its salvation
in nerves and tantrums. And he was an
expert who made the ivory keys a second
voice to the prevailing fiddle. News comes
my way of a recent stroke of more (or less)
good luck that has pursued Schwabe in the
person of an American millionairess. This
female bank-vault has offered the genial
music * man £lOOO a year -to teach her the
violin. He sees no obstacle in the way, for
the real business of his life is to fiddle. ’The
piano was merely a successful experiment.
Donald Mcßeath, the youthful fiddler who
played in this town once or twice last year
has been offered an eight months’ engage-
ment with the Clara Butt concert co due
here in about three months. The wage is a
tempting lure, but the boy is still a student
at the Melbourne Uni., under the charge of
Felix Gade, professor of the violin in that
seat of learning. Mcßeath promises to be
one of Australia’s first fiddlers. The dis-
traction of eight months’ public applause
before his art matures may put him off the
track and land him amongst the Swelled
Heads. Hence Donald’s music-master hasn’t
given his consent at date of writing.
Ella Caspers, the Goulburn contralto, is
forging steadily to the front in London. The
conductor of the Streatham Choral Society
recently congratulated the Australian Voice
on its academic interpretation of the Angel
music in “Gerontius.”
The first free-tea matinee at the Tivoli
was a booming success. The dress circle
showed an extensive area of summer frock,
and the wearers fanned themselves com-
placently in the peace that comes before a
cup of tea gratis. Claire Romaine was lady-
in-charge. She wore a demure frock, bagged
her head in a tasselled cap, and fluttered
round behind crockery and cakes, while Mrs.
Hugh Mclntosh lent her aid. Minnie Kauff-
man, the trick cyclist, did some hair-raising
feats of balance with her wheels before the
liquid refreshment came round. “My
Fancy,” a saucy looking lady in kilts, danced
the sand off the floor on the same occasion.
Prof. Fblix Gade, a long, lathy slab of
musical culture from Melbourne Uni., is
holidaying here with his wife. He is a
pupil of the famous Belgian fiddler Ysaye,
whose name looks like a Japanese town. A
great-uncle of Gade. by the way, was the
late Neils Gade, a Danish composer whose
statue is one of the minor landmarks of
Copenhagen.
All women are not afraid of mice. The
London press recently published the chal-
lenge of a daring dame who threatened to
catch more mice with her hands than any
man in Britain. A male champion promptly
entered the lists. Results are not to hand
as. yet. The lady mouse-catcher, however,
stipulated that she should be allowed to
wear gloves. This suggests a sub-conscious
fear of the “creepy” feeling these small
beasts give the average woman when she
curls up in bed to listen to a cryptic scratch-
ing on the wainscoat.
Harry Lauder, who comes this way some
time in the near future, is a fierce champion
of the kilt. He might be induced, for a few
extra thousand pounds a week, to enter the
lists with Senator Stewart and see who’s
the better man. Lauder’s humor may be of
the drought-dry variety, from the Australian
point of view ; but his passionate desire to
wear his knees in the fresh air will drive
the Highland Society to a frenzied attack of
bagpipes.
Mr. Charles Danvers, the Australasian
manager of the Liverpool, London and Globe
Insurance Co., recently stepped ashore in
Sydney after a trip to the war-worn face of
Europe. He mentions meeting the golden-
haired Percy Grainger and his youthful-
looking chaperon-in-chief, Mamma Grainger.
Yours affectionately,
vANORIAN.
Australia escaped another marine dis-
aster last week by a whisker’s width. The
passenger steamer Brundah, en route from
Sydney to North Coast ports, stubbed her
toe, during a fog, on Seal Rocks. A sud-
denly-wakened and alarmed skipper rushed
to the bridge, and barely clawed her off the
tangs waiting to rend her. Four other
vessels have, in recent years, struck the pro-
tuberance, and they all managed to do the
job so thoroughly as to sink in a few mo-
ments. A fifth, the Macleay, butted the
rocks a little further south, and disappeared
with all hands excepting two —disappeared
so suddenly that nobody knows to this day
exactly where the remains lie. These five
vessels, like the Titanic, struck on the bilge,
or abaft the collision bulkhead. The Brun-
dah hit bow on, and, although crippled,
paddled up the coast at half speed to Lis-
more, where she arrived with six feet of
Davy Jones s unpleasant property in her
first alleged water-tight compartment.
Aoel Webb, one of Adelaide’s many liter-
ary lawyers, passed some spread-eagle elo-
quence on to Dick Butler, of the S.A. Gov-
ernment, at a deputation last week. The
occasion was a simple discussion about a
railway and Butler seemed in a cheerful
mood. It turned out later that he was, quite
unexpectedly, going to grant what was
asked for, and he smiled frequently; where-
upon Webb solemnly “warned him that it
was not wise to laugh at a British commun-
ity vhen it told the Government that a
thing was intolerable.” Forthwith, Peter
Balor and the Eureka stockade, as well as
tne tea in Boston harbor, were brought in
th ? occasion - Butler made a
‘ m £ e , bu^ neat retort He had the luck to
vLl ta %Jl e^ rer S 0 - often in the drought
jeais that he has acquired the lasting nick-
I ? ls , mal , Diek ” i so he merely re-
marked that he thought, instead of getting
him smile. “ ° Ught to be glad to see

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 20, 1913.
My Dear Yaruie,—
Peter Mcßride, prospective Agent-General
in London, has a handsome wife who will
attend to the social duties connected with
the post. Old timers say she is remarkably
like her grandmother, one of the Lawsons
who owned practically all the buildings in a
small, early township beyond Geelong. As
a young woman, she was easily the most
striking-looking person between there and
Adelaide.
Premier Denham, of Bananaland, and his
wife, are at the Grand Hotel. While he was
lunching in three volumes at Parliament
House, she was entertaining her friends in
the cool depths of the towering hotel op-
posite. Both these northerners complain
bitterly of the heat of Melbourne streets,
and wonder how white people can live so
far from the tropics.
Help Wheatley has been granted four
months’ leave of absence to settle the affairs
of his late father, who was a colonel in the
artillery. Meanwhile, Governor Puller has
decided to struggle on short-handed, and the
remaining two assistants are chasing around
doing the wrap-carrying of four. They hope
to pull through without calling in the.’assist-
ance of a hat rack.
The Marshall Hall opera, performed at
Her Majesty’s some time ago, is supposed
to be too short for the music lovers, so Louis
Esson has written the libretto of an operetta
to serve as curtain-raiser to the Great Work,
and the eminent composer is busy setting it
to music. He is so occunied with this job
that he has not been heard to threaten any-
thing special for the Wagner centenary,
Which happens in May of this year. Euro-
pean musicians are tremendously concerned
about the commemorative performances to
come. Dr. J. W. Barrett, the wealthy medi-
cine-man who presides over the Marshall
Hall league, is returning to Australia shortly,
so Wagner may possibly be heard of again
by that time.
Schoolmaster Adamson thinks the local
flapper is forward, and heroically says so.
Anyone who observes the rambling school-
girl of the second social grade doesn’t need
telling that the young lady lures the school-
boy on. (Note. —I was told that The
Bulletin’s Religious Editor once belonged
to a cricket club that was broken up by two
girls. One of them used to regularly abduct
the young captain from afternoon practice.
The vice-captain made a brave effort to stop
the “affair” by calling the captain’s lurer
“that fat tart.” But the young captain was
so infatuated that he would drop all pre-
tence of playing cricket immediately the
sirens appeared on the skyline. At
last the second one enslaved the vice-captain,
and then the club went into mourning and
bad language and liquidation.) Some few
years ago an American flapper induced the
Best Girls to form a Kissing Society. Every
member was sworn to kiss her partner after
every dance at the flapper frolics. Violent
measures had to be adopted to stop the peril-
ous practice. But the boys were probably
jolly glad about it. The boy is always in-
tent on his games ; and the girl is always in-
tent on hers —which, of course, is Love.
I have been talking with one who saw a
good deal of the late Mr. Trevanion—the un-
fortunate youth who died in London the other
day from a stupendous dose of veronal. He
came into £50,000 when he was 21, and an-
other £30,000 when he reached 25; and he
was due for another £30,000 on the death of
an aged aunt. An inventory of his charms,
or whatever one might call them, suggests
a page out of an ultra-exotic novel. He was
6ft. or more, and as willowy-thin as a para-
sol. His hands and feet were those of a girl—
one of those girls who eat chocolates all day,
and decline to go sea-bathing for fear of
ruining their complexions. A cloud of scent
followed him by night and day, and if he
didn’t “make up,” his hectic flush and the
aspect of his large, soulful eyes wronged
him. His sailor friend Roe, to whom all his
money goes unless a herd of infuriated rela-
tives succeed in upsetting the will, is a radi-
cally different type. He is large, masterful
and rough—the last person one would have
expected to have anything in common with
the effeminate Trevanion.
Apropos this Trevanion, an Old Inhabi-
tant sends me this :
Trevanion, the man with the mystery attached to
his death, was connected with various Australian
families. In June, 1882, Florence Eva, daughter of
the first baronet Daniel Cooper, married Hugh
Arundel Trevanion, who was the only son of Hugh
Charles Trevanion and Lady Frances Bowes-Lyon.
The marriage was dissolved in 1887. Hugh Tre-
vanion, who is said to have died from an overdose of
something, was son of Hugh Arundel Trevanion and
Florence Eva, the daughter of Daniel Cooper. His
£BO,OOO was inherited mostly from his divorced
•grandfather Trevanion, a member of a well-known
Cornish family.
Tennis men are planning a send-off smoke
concert to the British Isles just before they
leave for England. The function will up-
set the calm of the Oriental Hotel on the
evening of the 25th. Some people have not
yet forgotten the joyous uproar of the dinner
given after the Davis Cup contest. It is
said that the Cup itself had such a good
time that a silversmith had to doctor it next
morning. It is also whispered that one ten-
nis player who went home at a reasonable
hour was laughingly pursued, captured, and
brought back to the revel.
The cricket matches for the King’s
Theatre Shield have been livening up the
Warehousemen’s Ground. On Wednesday
a team of doctors perspired in vain against
the invincible men of King’s, and, on Friday,
the final match (Her Majesty’s versus
King’s) proved a horrible experience for the
panto, team. So Anderson’s , £lO trophy re-
mains in the family, so to speak. Eugenie
Duggan Anderson, very heavily ostriched,
watched the game from the club house;
Oscar Asche and Lily Brayton, the latter
muffled in many veils, applauded like mere
supers; and Violet Loraine, under a broad
black leaf hat, and in a white dress, wore
a purple-clad mother at her elbow and an
admiring half-circle of men in the back-
ground.
Most of the spectators went on to a tea-
party given by Mrs. Brockhoff at Fife
House, one of the big, cool mansions in
Queen’s-road. Nella Webb motored along in
a black chiffon support to a startling yel-
low feather. Mrs. Brockhoff received her
visitors in an awninged terrace. She was
gowned in white, blue and black. Another
Mrs. Brockhoff spread a glad, pink hat,
which tinged her other coverings with rose.
Half-way through the ices, a whirring tele-
phone informed the hostess that several guests
were sweltering impatiently at a Collins-
street cafe where she usually entertains. The
stranded ones, informally invited, could not
believe that any woman actually meant to
“party” in her own home in these Maryann-
less days. On being told that the daring
experiment was actually being made, they
hurried out and found it unusually oleasant.
Mrs. Armytage, the fine old grandmother
of the clan, has returned from her lonely pil-
grimage to Pagenstacher, the German ocu-
list. The operation was successful, but the
homecoming a sorrowful one. The husband
she left in good health and busy with land
sales had died during her long absence.
The widow of the late Edward Yeneken
died at her residence, Banole, Armadale, last
week. The old lady, who carried her years
remarkably well, bore a startling likeness to
the late Queen Victoria. She had defied ill-
ness all her life, and was accounted clever,
even in the days when women were not en-
couraged to be brainy. Edward, the eldest
son, with his wife and family, inhabits a
large Toorak mansion.
Mary Conly, who had unaccountably bad
luck in her native Melbourne when she came
along with Walter Kirby some three years
ago, is leaving London next month for an-
other concert tour in Australia. This time
the plump, impressive little soprano is bring-
ing Miss Natalie Dawson as pianist. She
was one time of Melbourne, too.
Agnes Murphy, Melba’s one-time secre-
tary, is in Melbourne getting ready to do
battle for Vida Goldstein at next elections.
Bank-manager Norman McLeod, acci-
dentally shot dead at Cohuna last week, was
engaged to a daughter of Colonel Greenfield,
of Ballarat, and the wedding was planned
to take place at an early date. But “they
tolled the one bell only.”
Sam Mackay turned the final handing over
of his Berwick horse-farm into a motor
picnic. Baronet Clarke, Herbert Power and
Norman Wilson motored up and toasted
Andrew Chirnside, the new proprietor. It
was a men’s party, and the wives left at
home did their own celebrating. James
Gibb, Sam’s herculean neighbor at Berwick,
managed to sell out before him, and, having
since disposed of other properties, is now
stoutly considering a trip to England.
The Guy Sherwood couple, who only came
back from Japan about 10 minutes ago, are
feverishly preparing for a March depar-
ture. Spain, Switzerland and France will
be included in the next wander. Then they
will make for London, where sister May
Parker will welcome them to her dosy flat in
Queen’s Gate. Though there is no mention
of a return ticket, Mrs. Guy’s two boys will
continue to grow wool and mutton locally.
Manager George Edwardes’s nephew
would seem to have voyaged to Australia to
occupy a stage box at Her Majesty’s. Nightly
he fixes his eyes on the stage just when one
particular charmer is about. When she
quits, his attention is apt to wander.
Wanderers have sensational tales to tell
of Mr. Willie Lawson, once so well known
in this city. He left for London half a dozen
years or more ago, ostensibly to buy a decent
pair of socks and a couple of more or less
civilised-looking ties. He has never been
back since. He lives in Paris, with occa-
sional brief descents on the Riviera and
London. A friend of mine was supping at
the Rat Mort one night, when a pale, young-
old man, with a fragmentary moustache and
an emaciated figure, was indicated to her.
“That,” she was told, “is one of the best-
known players at Monte Carlo —an Aus-
tralian. It was Mr. Lawson. He was
never a wild gambler when in these parts ;
but, mayhap, the air of foreign parts has
changed him, or perhaps, again, my friend
was of the romantic school. Like the rest
of the jeunesse doree of the French capital,
he is a gay and glittering spectacle in the
matter of jewellery. He is never coming
back to Australia any more, I fear. For
one thing, with our incompetent police force,
it would be reckless to bring the contents of
his jewel-case here.
A pang of envy made the Very Best wince
when the news came through that Byron
Moore’s Ruby was unexpectedly sparkling-
in the limelight that streams upon a vice-
regal dais. The spinster went off to India
under the wing of Mrs. Dick Casey, on a
visit to a woman friend. On her arrival, she
discovered to her dismay that her friend was
far too ill to entertain her. A prompt re-
turn seemed to be the only solution, when
the Carmichaels, who had journeyed down
to collect Mrs. Casey, politely offered to
shelter the disappointed one at the vice-regal
residence.
Leonard Borwick, the gentle pianist who
came unheralded to Melbourne a while ago
and captured the musical section in one
mass, was the largest lion at the Jim Bar-
retts’ show at the Austral Salon, London.
Amongst the assembled Australians was J.
L. Jona, of the Lyster Institute, who, on
the strength of his Beit Scholarship (worth
£250 a year), went abroad in search of
knowledge. After going north and pumping
Professor Sherrington on the subject of
nerves, he aired a few remarks at a learned
gathering in London, before leaving for
Vienna to look into tin; matter of tempera-
ture or something.
A stray millionaire was the centre of an
uproarious scene the other evening in a caf&
that does not close its supper doors before
midnight. He was' hosting a large party,
and, just when the wine was reddest, he
ordered the band inside, and insisted on con-
ducting the music himself. This led to a.
tierce argument with the accredited leader.
That small matter squared, the moneyed one
found he had a referee job to attend to. One
of his men guests had spoken to a bright-
eyed lady who was supping near by with a
stout Hebrew. The Hebrew used all his
weight in discouraging the rash stranger,
and it took the millionaire some time to
separate them. That accomplished, he had’
to separate himself from some money for the
broken crockery, and soothe the offended pro-
prietor. It was a busy wind-up to a festive
occasion.
The Bananaland Eddingtons, now on the
Victorian rolls for the coming elections, have
steamed over to the Speck with daughter
Leonore, who is on the just-out list. The
Eddingtons lately bought a villa on the
Toorak-road, which, having stood empty for
months, had accumulated foolish legends as
well as weeds. One legend was to the effect
that it was haunted; another story had a
vicious drain as its chief support. The new
owner, who wears white spats and a lordly
smile (the white spats and the smile have
no bearing on the subject, but are thrown in
as a sort of literary bonus), paled with ap-
prehension on hearing these yarns; but, to
make a long paragraph short, the brave
house furbishers got to work on the pre-
mises, and, while adding a room or two,
found neither ghost nor drain. So the family
takes possession of Cailingford, late Rothes,
with renewed confidence.
Ina Varley (sister to the late Violet), a
pretty little girl who typewrites for the
management of the King’s Theatre, is just
recovering from a nerve-racking meeting
with a shark at Half Moon Bav some weeks
ago. The shark gave her the glad green
eye at close quarters, and she fainted in the
water. Some prompt man dashed in
and carried her out, while papa Varley at-
tacked the monster with a deck chair.
A story of Marv-Ann-from-oversea. One
newly-arrived general had consulted a sooth-
sayer before leaving London, and received a
shilling’s-worth of information re a Dark
Woman and a Fair Woman. The Dark
Woman intended to derail her, or
something; so she was exhorted to
follow the Fair Woman. A young,
black-haired bride on this side wanted a
maid; but as the boat came in when she
was due to receive Horace at the front gate,
she deputed a fair friend to act as a recep-
tion committee. The friend was agreeably
surprised at the eagerness of the girl she
was introduced to on the steamer, and took
her home to the dark bride, never dreaming
that the shilling curse of an English sooth-
sayer was hovering above them. When Mary
Ann was introduced to her real missus, she
emitted a smothered shriek, gave some sort
of terrified notice, and fled from the place,
leaving three badly-puzzled people among the
newly-planted roses.
A super-lady in one of the Melbourne
theatrical shows is not “walking on” for
nothing. Papa supplies a motor-car, a maid,
and enough pocket money to allow of special
suppers being serit up to the theatre from one
of the Collins-street cafes. When this ardu-
ous job is over, the actress in embryo goes
off to London, where, with a cosy flat and
maid, she will continue her theatrical career.
A regular battalion of the usual matinfie
flappers floated along to Fred Bluett’s bene-
fit at the Opera House last Thurs-
day afternoon. Chocolates and giggles
were the order of the afternoon, which
netted the comedian about £3OO. Two
boxes were professionally peopled. Nella
Webb and co. furnished the upper, and her
somewhat early-Victorian garb looked fetch-
ing—though the sunburnt neck was a little
out of the picture. De Biere and his black-
eyed spouse wore quaint clothing in another
coop. There was a sprinkling of the Best
people, and they sat up and took notice when
a farce came along which contained young
Onslow and another Asche importation.
Violet Loraine’s little heliotrope ditty of ad-
vice also seemed to interest them in a furtive
sort of way.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—-
Miss Jacob, the principal of our best-known girls’
school, has just lost by death the support of her
sister. Miss Annie Jacob. No teacher had a bigger
circle of girl-lovers ; it stretched from Mount Gambier
where she used to have a school of her own, right up
to the farthest north, and spread east and west as far
as the continent reaches.
The Dick Hawkers are back from Westralia, he
singing glad because his new horses are doing better
than the critics pronhesied.
Dr Ramsay Smith spent most of his recent six
months leave attending conferences and wandering
over ho.ipitals. One of his best-loved pastimes is to
supply English and European Universities with the
remains of Binghi deceased. The decision of the Mel-
bourne Science Congress that no more nigger skele-
tons should be exported saddened him beyond measure.
Miss Crabbe, who is staying with her sister, Mrs.
John Shiels, leaves shortly for Europe with Miss
Polly Shiels.
The Ways are back at Montefiore from Noar-
lunga. The tyrant Business is responsible for an
earlier recall than usual.
Mrs. Kidman and her daughter are in Melbourne.
The Closer-Ividman wedding is billed for the end of
the month. Me, as you know, doubtless, is an Ad-
miral or something.
The Adelaide Racing Club has decided to run to a
new totalisator at Victoria Park. The present one
has been on the edge of ruin for many months, as a
result of wear and tear and extreme old age.
Gilbert, son of John Lewis, M.L.C. (he that is
Gilbert wears gilt and braid as a Captain of the
38th Central India Horse), has been doing shining
things at polo. His team proved the best of 12
which competed in the Indore State tournament, and
thereby captured a £lOO cup.
Squatter Mcßride, of the Burra district, has just
got over a severe operation. Considering he is 84
years old, it’s none too bad an advt. for the arid
North.
The Bosanquets are going comparatively slow.
Last week, barring the entertaining of the Nutter
Thomases and Mr. Justice Murray, and the pre-
sentation of a long-service medal to Superintendent
Farrell, of the Yatala Labor Prison, they did not
work.
Mr. Justice Herbert, who formerly sat in the S.
Aus. Assembly, and afterwards represented the State
Government in the Northern Territory, is re-visiting
his friends here. With his wife and daughter he has
■come down from Papua to spend a holiday at East
Adelaide.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

POLITCAL
POINTS
A member of the Science Congress says
that the day will come when Australia will
recognise its greatest plague in the white
ant. But what about uncle?
David Syme’s old pal, Simon Fraser, who
has been at least a consistent “Liberal Pro-
tectionist,” excused himself from having a
say in the selection of the new leader of the
Fusion party. The old man, being about
to withdraw his weary legs from the politi-
cal track, has declined to come along and
vote for Joe Cook, or any other candidate.
Out of 75 members in Australia’s House
of Representatives, only two attended every
sitting last session. These were Minister
King O’Malley and James Mathews (Mel-
bourne Ports). Total sitting days numbered
105. The most absent members were Oom
Bill Lyne (a sick man), who appeared in
the House on two occasions only; and Hans
Irvine (also on leave to hunt health), who
did not show up at all. Prime Minister
Fisher missed two sittings; Attorney-Gen-
erO Hughes, two; Alfred Deakin, 20; and
Jokook eight.
A new patriotic use has been found for
the A.N.A. Exhibition of Australian Manu-
factures. The forthcoming display at Melb.
Exhibition Building will bring the products
of the Northern Territory and Papua into
notice; also on the 2000 ft. of floor space
rented by the Federal Government the Lith-
gow Small Arms Factory will have a stand ;
the Federal clothing and harness factories
are to make a show of their respective out-
puts for military service; and the Naval
Department has promised a display of tor-
pedoes and how they are worked. With one
thing and another the Government will be
a very impressive exhibitor.
Maoriland’s anti-Defence, Universal-bro-
therhood-of-man Federation recently col-
lided with itself in connection with a tram-
way contract at Napier. The contractors
had secured 11.000 hardwood sleepers in
Australia, and had arranged to ship them
across the Tasman in a Japanese-manned
boat. But the M.L. waterside workers (who
are affiliated with the Federation) reckoned
that the time wouldn’t be ripe to unload
white man’s cargo from an Asiatic vessel on
arrival. So there is a large crack now in
the Federation’s Universal-brotherhood-of-
man plank ; and beautiful theory once more
goes down before hard practice.
Victoria woke up last week to find that
for about five years it has been running a
State laundry. It was the Railway Depart-
ment that perpetrated the horror. The
washing of the sheets and towels for the
“sleepers” used to be done by contract; but
the work was not to the satisfaction of the
inspecting officers, and deliveries were un-
certain. So the Department started a laun-
dry of its own at North Melbourne, where
43.000 articles _ are handled every month,
and the work is done better, more cheaply
and with machine-like regularity. The net
saving is about £B5O per annum ; but had
there been no cash saving, the experiment
would have justified itself by the better work
and the prompt delivery.
The Department of External Affairs has
a nice perception of the relative sizes of
things. It is advertising for two agricul-
tural experts who “must hold a diploma
from an agricultural college, have had ex-
perience in experimental work, and be com-
petent to take charge of a Government ex-
perimental farm during the absence of the
manager.” These gentlemen are to go to a
place where living is at present expensive,
to do pioneering agricultural work for a
province, and they are offered £2OO a year
—a wage that the manager of a Victorian
market garden would scorn. Do Fisher,
Thomas and co. x-eally want to develop the
Territory?
BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.
TRAGEDLAN : "Did you obser-r-rve , sir-r-r, how
the crowd r-responded to my famous death-
scene! Sir-r-r, the Whole house WEPT!”
COMEDIAN : “Yep! They knew you hadn't
really died."
“ ’Appy Jack” Scaddan, Westralia’s Labor
Premier, says his mission to England is to
meet the financial people face to face, and
convince them that the State’s securities
are good. In short, he is making a visit to
the pawnshop like the old woman with the
gridiron, whose mission also was to convince
Moses that it was an excellent gridiron.
Naval affairs are looking up in John
Bull’s country. Recruits are offering so
fast for service that all the ships are likely
soon to be completely manned. This is
owing to the better pay offered by the Gov-
ernment. The English navy has some splen-
did traditions, including a diet of split peas,
but its new fame of paying the sailor a
little cash for his work is likely to count
more than all when it comes to clearing for
action.
A FELTON BEQUEST.
CRITICAL STRABGER: "Femme Couchant!”
CUMOCAL Do.: “Yes! They generally are."
Australian manufactures have just got
another lift. Dr. Price, Melb. City Organ-
ist—an imported citizen, by the way—has
advised the Council, which wants a grand
piano for the Mayoress’s rooms in the Town
Hall, to buy an Australian-made machine.
It was not claimed for the Australian in-
strument that it had any peculiarly distinc-
tive excellence in competition with the Ger-
man and English boxes of music; but Price
reported that none of the best were better
than the local product. So the local pro-
duct got the order.
From an old Parliamentarian :
Re the naming of the Federal capital. A corres-
pondent to the daily press whoops for the name
“Parlcesville,” on account of Sir ’Enry’s “enthusias-
tic and untiring efforts.” To a certain badly-
informed section of the public of the Ma State
Parkes is the “father” of various statesmanlike hap-
penings—for example, Federation and the Education
Act. The truth is he bitterly opposed both, fought
like 40 wild cats and used every device in his won-
derful bag of political tricks to defeat both; and,
when he saw the movements were coming up in spite
of him, he promptly “discovered” and “pioneered”’
them. By the aid of an undiscriminating press, Parkes
is generally credited with the great change in the
education system, which was pioneered by Green-
wood (who ever hears of him now?), and forced on
by George Dibbs, whose first entry into politics was
on that special question and in the teeth of Parkes’s
opposition. How the old Freetrader and ex-Chartist
barred the path of Federation is fresher in the minds
of the public; and Wise’s adroit special pleading
in The Lone Hand on behalf of the man who was
almost the last to be converted to Australian Union,
only amuses those who know the truth.
Locust”: I thought (from long perusal
of the Sydney daily press) that the Labor
party was responsible for the high prices,
the high rents and the added cost of living.
Judge of my surprise when I was shown a
circular from the Association of Berlin
Pianoforte Manufacturers, which addresses
Australian and other clients thus:—
Berlin, August, 1912. Gentlemen, —Owing to the
continual rise in price of almost all materials and
fittings used in the pianoforte industry during the
last two years, the association has found it neces-
sary to call a meeting to consider in what way the
difficulty of a slight increase in price might be best
arranged so as not to inconvenience the pianoforte
trade more than absolutely necessary. After care-
fully discussing the matter the various members
ascertained the following facts: The price of timber
has increased about 10 per cent., sounding-board
wood 25 per cent., iron frames. 10 per cent., ivory 5
per cent., packing cases 15 per cent., etc., etc.
In face of this the assembled manufacturers found
they would be reluctantly compelled to advance the
present quotations of pianos 5 per cent. This small
advance will barely cover the additional outlay, and
the members trust that the trade will co-operate with
them and assist them as much as possible in these
trying circumstances.
Reports from the U.S.A. also show that
there are similar “trying circumstances”
oyer there. So it will be seen that Jim
McGowen and Andy I isher are not doing
it all.
Myola— i.e., “meeting place”—said to be
one of the most favored labels for the make-
shift Federal capital, has a suitable Binghi
meaning. But the foreigner—especially the
foreigner who has ever seen the wilderness—
is bound to misprint it Myopia. In fact,
there has been enough shortsightedness
about the selection of the place to justify
anyone in calling it Specs.
“Investigator” explains how not to tax the
land: —
.7. D. Ormond, M.L.C. and big land-owner of Maori-
land, unbagged a feline when speaking recently on
the Massey Government’s Land Bill. About five years
ago, he said, Prime Minister Joseph Ward was pro-
posing “a very considerable increase in the graduated
land tax,” and “a small deputation” (including
Ormond) assured louseph they would cut up their
estates for settlement, and induce their friends to do
likewise, if he would reduce his taxation proposals.
“On those terms,” added Ormond, “the rates were
reduced and the application was acceded to.” It
was just the sort of rotten compromise that Joseph
Ward was partial to, and that has driven his party
into the wilderness of Opposition, where they cavort
to-day headless, tail-
less and hopeless. Ac-
cording to Ormond,
the landowners o f
Hawkes Bay, in ful-
filment of their pro-
mise to Ward, sold a
lot of land ; yet one
of the first acts of
Massey, “the farmers’
Prime Minister,” is to
give the screw another
turn, bringing down
the exemntion limit,
under the 25 per cent,
super - tax, from
£40,000 to £30,000
unimproved value. So,
after five years’ cur-
rency of the lan d-
owners’ promise to
lou, even Massey, who
would not willingly
harm a single hair of
a landowners’ whis-
kers, finds himself
constrained, for de-
cency’s sake, to make
a show of increasing
the tax. He can now
claim to be a greater
democrat than Ward.
At the same time, the
pose is cheap. Most
owners can easily get
out of tax range b y
means of a family par-
tition or so-called sale.
The splitting of a
£30,000 estate into
two or three parts
avoids the super-tax,
and gives color to the
specious plea that the
landowner class is sub-
dividing voluntarily,
and may. therefore, he
left in p«*ce. But the
process gives no ap-
preciable aid to closer
settlement, and the
earth-hungry public is
still up against the
curse of the land
monopolist. A suner-
tax that merely
changes the face of a
title has no ■ bearing
whatever on closer
settlement, and
a scientific and comprehensive scheme of graduated
land taxation is .iust the thing that Maoriland will
never see while the Masseys and the Wards are in
the saddle.
The S. M. Herald says that the estab-
lished banks have nothing to fear from the
Commonwealth Bank, by reason of the bad
service inseparable from “the Government
stroke.” The Commonwealth Bank will cer-
tainly give better conditions to its clerks
than a good many other banks do, and may
be relied upon not to copy the regulation
against marriage on less than £2OO, and
therefore the Herald means to say that
better conditions mean worse service, and
that efficiency is most to be expected from
the sweated. But the S.M.H. says nothing
of the cheaper exchanges and discounts that
must come by reason of the fact that the
Commonwealth Bank has no dividends to
earn for watered stock. Quite a lot of bis
accounts see this already, however.
Professor Laby, of Wellington (ML)
concerning the proposed Australian-Maori-
land naval defence of the Pacific:
Comparatively few people in Maoriland attached
any importance to the Japanese menace. That was
the fundamental difference between Australia and
Maoriland on naval matters.
One thing is sure, anyway—a battleship or
two in the North Sea will be a mighty poor
help to Maoriland if the Jap does happen
And as Rentaro Kayahara (who
probably knows his own countrymen better
than Maoriland knows them) latelv put it
in the Tokio Eastern Review:—
TTie population of our country has increased so
rapidly that she is now- compelled to send her sur-
p'' IS Population abroad. In answer to the question
whether there is any suitable place wide enough to
vent this surplus, we have come to the conclusion
that there would be no other way, though it might
appear rather bold to affirm, except to have re-
course to the partition of the British Empire
the climate of Australia is tolerable with the Japan-
ese people. It abounds in natural wealth. This is
the most desirable place for the emigrants from
Japan. Where could we find a more suitable land
for the establishment of a new Japan? Then we
should naturally come to the question how we should
take possession of Australia. The partition of the
British Empire among the other Powers would be a
ready answer.
Seemingly, the people who attach most im-
portance to the menace which Maoriland
derides are the Japanese themselves. And
they ought to know.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, ’ere’s my tip
Fer the Fusion ship,
An’ I tells it straight an’ square.
I’m a rare ole tar
As nigh an’ far
You’ll not meet ev’rywhere.
I’ve seen ’er sail
In many a gale,
But she’s done ’er final trip ;
So I ’itches up me breeches, an’ a simple tale I
pitches
O' this good ole Fusion ship.
’Twas Alf an’ Joe,
Long years ago,
They built ’er any ’ow.
’Twas a strange ole skiff
With ’er keel skew-wiff,
An’ a double-ended bow.
Yus, a nose each end,
An’ a Grecian bend
Amidships, quaint an’ queer.
When I seen ’er take the water, “Ho!” ses I, “she
is a snorter!”
An’ I gives a ’earty cheer.
An’ sail she did.
But I’ll lay ten quid
No ship, before nor since,
Done ’arf ’er tricks;
’Er darned ole fix
’Ud make longshoremen wince.
She’d bob and bow,
The blamed old scow,
Like a wet an’ foolish ’en;
An’ ’er subsekint behav’er an’ the efforts fer to
save ’er
Was a treat fer sailor-men.
An’ Alf ’e was
’Er skipper, ’cos
No other could be got
To sail that craft;
An’ fore an’ aft
They was a rare ole lot.
So queer a crew
I never knew.
An’ Joe, ’e was fust mate.
An’ to ’ear ’im scold an’ rate ’er, when ’e tried to
navigate ’er—-
Well, I tell yeh, it was great!
Fer some they said
To point ’er ’ead
Fer nor’-nor’-east by east,
Fer Tory Bay,
An’ some said “Nay,”
An’ the langwidge never eased.
An’ some they pressed
To sail doo west,
Fer the ole Freetection port.
An’ the way she waltzed an’ wobbled, while they
’owled an’ fought an’ squabbled.
Ho, I never seen sich sport!
An’ pore ole Joe!
’ls watch below
Was mostly short an’ sweet ;
Fer ’e never knew
Wot time that crew .
Might up an’ change ’er beat.
But Alf, the boss,
’E took ’is doss,
An’ ’e let ’er sail or stop ;
Fer in days when seas was finer ’e was skipper of a
liner, v
An’ ’e sorter felt the drop.
Now, she’s dropped at last
’Er anchor fast
In the ’arbor of Recess.
’Er sheets is tore,
An’ ’er plates is wore,
An’ she’ll sail no more, I guess.
Alf got the pip
On ’er final trip,
An’ there’s some as said ’e swore
’E was sickened of ’er capers; so ’e ’anded in ’is
papers,
An’ she’ll put to sea no more.
But it’s ’ip, ’ip, ’ip!
Fer the Fusion ship,
Fer the navigatin’ ’en!
Since ’er cruise begun
She ’as give great fun
To us ’eartj' sailor-men.
We ’ave cheered an’ laughed
An’ joked an’ chaffed
Since the day she put to sea ;
So I takes a pull and ’itches (as our ’abit is) mv
breeches,
An’ I gives ’er three times three.

STRONG INDICATION OF WORMS.
One of the most pronounced symptoms of
worms in children is grinding the teeth and
suddenly starting up out of sleep. There are
many symptoms of this most distressing com-
I WtiU
\ \vV> ~' ~~n;
\ —-
plaint from which not
only children suffer,
but adults also. When
there is a tendency to
pick the nose and the
bowels are irregular,
sometimes constipated,
and at other times re-
laxed. the appetite
variable, a copious
flow of saliva, and a
swelling of the upper
lip. there is a' strong
evidence of the presence of worms. The best
proof of worms is worms, and if their pre-
sence is suspected immediate steps should be
taken to positively establish the fact, and
when once established Comstock’s "Dead
Shot Worm Pellets should be administered
according to directions. Worms require a
specific medicine, and there is no remedy so
effective as these Pellets. They kill the
worms, destroy their eggs, and dislodge their
nests.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation for the
eradication in children and adults,

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Although the new Australian tennis selec-
tors had the satisfaction of seeing their first choice
turn the tables and beat the Englishmen, they have
the dissatisfaction of knowing that it wasn’t the best
team Australia could turn out on present form. With
the exception of a few patches in his singles with
Parke, Heath didn’t come within coo-ee of inter-
national play. His overhead smash, more particu-
larly in Friday’s doubles against Parke and Lowe,
wasn’t much above Z grade. He should have given
way to Horace Bice, the N.S.W. crack, who, besides
being a more suitable partner for Alf Jones, is in
infinitely better form. However, the Australian team
got home by seven matches, 17 sets, 149 games to
five matches, 12 sets, 121 games—very close, but a
'win all the same. Australia lost five singles and won
three, and took all the doubles. Dunlop lost to
Beamish, and to Lowe; Heath lost to Parke and to
Dixon ; A. B. Jones beat Lowe (6 —0, 6—l), but
Host to Beamish. Brookes won both his singles—-
Dixon (6 —0, 6—o) and Parke (9 —7, 6 —2). In
the doubles Jones and Heath beat Dixon and Beamish
and Parke and Lowe. Brookes and Dunlop beat
Dixon and Beamish (6 —0, 6 —3) and Parke and Lowe
(6 —2, 6—3). Thus, while the Australians, with the
exception of Brookes and Jones, were weak, in singles,
the Englishmen were correspondingly weak in doubles.
Certainly, Jones and Heath didn’t show much com-
bination in their doubles; but, then, they were
“strangers.”
The Brookes-Parke match was responsible for the
best tennis Sydney has seen for some time, or can ex-
pect to see for a long time. Except in the first set,
when Brookes appeared to have mislaid the back line,
the result never seemed in doubt. In his match
against Dixon, in which he didn’t lose one game, he
was almost flawless. Dunlop wasn’t playing up to
his customary form in doubles (he was decidedly
weak in singles),'but in neither of their matches did
he and Brookes need to play a third set. Jones,
except when he netted a few, . played very well and
came a good second to Brookes. "His net work was
very pretty. Also, he had earmarked a spot close in
on each side of the court, and when he got the ball
there it was quite safe.
v -T, he Cnsrlishmen gave a patchy show. Parke played
brilliantly, especially in the singles, but he hit a lot
wide, and his drive was more or less collared, the
Australians finding that it was better to wait for it
than rush to the net. Lowe, when his temper was
good, played a fair to middling game, and lost very
few of his services. Dixon, though very sure in his
other work, was very weak in his service, and in the
singles with Heath his double faults ran into two
figures. Beamish is much better in singles than
doubles. In his doubles against Jones and Heath he
messed up just about everything that came his wav
at the net. J
On the whole, the enthusiast who saw the play in
Sydney is left wondering how the Australians man-
aged to lose the Davis Cup in Melbourne.

While he was in Maoriland a couple of
weeks ago, C. P. Dixon, captain of the British Isle
lennisees, recorded some of his impressions of Aus-
tralasian players. Contrasting the Maori lander with
the Australian, he found the former suffering from
weak backhands ; but the Maorilander had the virtue
unlike several of the leading Australian players, of not
3\f h i e n Sa T,/® Ce of ‘ he rac quet for the forehand
and backhand drive. For Ollivier, the Canterbury
man who defeated Beamish, he had very generous
and proper praise. “Had Beamish been in Ws most
brilliant vein he could hardly have hoped to have
wrested the honors from Ollivier, whose services were
at times well-nigh untakeable.” Dixon credited
m W °f tl?e Britisb team in Melbourne to:
nority in ground play, both as regards
placement and seventy; (2) greater accuracy in the

Lowe, the spoilt baby of the British tennis
team, made a bad break in the Test Match. He was
actually asked to play on a court without the
customary green baize background, and, more impor-
bt n thp not s ' lrrou nded by stands for spectators. P So
by the way, was his Austral’an ooponent, A. B. Jones.
lii"+i, P etu l a ntly asked for the limelight, and snorted
all through his match. When asked civilly by the
committee people at the conclusion of the game to
lom them at lunch, Lowe replied churlishly. On the
£ ay ’ though he showed no temper, he
played to the gallery. After one mis-hit he turned
round and stared at the sun. so that the audience
should know whose fault it was. Had an Australian
behaved aj Lowe did on Friday, the English critics-
not the British players—would have said something
manshlp ° oCkney lalifirua * e about Australian sports-

Johnson managed to get out of the frving-
P j^nnn to , th « last week. Somebody offered him
£5OOO to fight Al. Palzer, sometime White Hone
now busted. Johnson immediately closed his g-riD-
sack and took the shortest rail route to Canada, with
a view, so he said, to getting one of his old mana-
gers now located in Toronto, to act for him again.
A United States functionary descended upon him
era route, and, when Johnson offered his word of
honor, in addition to the monev he had already nut
up, to return within one week, this grim official
merely _closed one eye derisively, and snanped on the
handcuffs. So Johnson came back, like the cat, and
for safety’s sake was shown into a condemned cell
Condemned cells are alwavs haunted, and durine the
night, according to Johnson, spooks sprang out of the
walls and gibbered as they writhed on his chest, and
danced wild fandangoes over the brown landscape of
his face. When morning came Johnson offered to
lump from »i'e tallest sky-scraner in Chicago rather
than put in such another night. Evidently the big
black s nerves are going.
* * * *
The very latest of Johnson is that he will
sail away to Paris to box, fight, or scrap with Al.
Palzer on or about June 25. The winner is to get
60 per cent, of the gate, with a guarantee of £5OOO,
and Johnson is also guaranteed the £5OOO, win,
lose, or draw. It sounds hopeful, as the black’s
manager O’Rourke announces that Johnson will be
allowed to make the journey. Perhaps the U.S.A.
authorities are planning to get rid of Johnson.
Meantime, he has to explain why he started on the
unauthorised trip to Canada.
The illness of Charles Mitchell, once heavv-
weight champion of England, recalls his fight with
Jonel Sullivan, when he administered to that doughty
bruiser his first knock-down blow. Sullivan is gar-
dening .in Massachusetts and Mitchell is dying of
dropsy in a London hospital.
Jerry Jerome, the aboriginal pug, made very
short meat of Balzac at the Brisbane Stadium on Friday
nig-ht. The mill lasted just seven punches—every one
with the abo. behind it and the Frenchman in front
—and didn’t cover more than two minutes in all. The
nigger fought 21b. over weight, in spite of his agree-
ment to forfeit 60 sovs. if he didn’t weigh in at list.
41b., and the go started an hour late without the
point being adjusted. The left in the solar plexus
that made Balzac take the count had him writhing
with pain, and he had to be lifted to his corner. Pat
Bradley and Charley Godfrey are matched to fight
for the Australian welter championship at the
Olympic, in the same village, next Saturday.
* * * *
The Sydney Sun’s London correspondent
made no beans about declaring the decision in the
Welsh-Mehegan fight quite wrong, and plain, bare-
faced robbery. He didn’t use those words, but he
did employ about 21 columns to show that was
what the decision amounted to. Mehegan’s chief
drawback appears to have been the neglect of his
seconds to keep his hair properly brushed; he had
an unkempt appearance at the end of the fight, which
seemed to impress the exquisite referee vastly. Ap-
pearances all help, and sometimes they decide.
The Audouy-Tim Land revival at Sydney
Stadium, on Saturday night, was a pleasing study in
expressions. Timothy is a youth in whom there is no
vice, if facial expression goes for anything. The
stiff-legged fighter curled his arms round his face in
an extraordinary manner, and smiled like a Cheshire
cat as he bored in. But his amiable facial demonstra-
tion did not prevent him lashing out with consider-
able force. The stiff leg does not appear to handicap
him much, as he seems to know thoroughly how to
use it. If he could only use his fists half as well
he would be a formidable fighter, indeed. Also, if he
were just half as quick with his hands as he is with
his feet, it would be a great improvement. On
Saturday night he was very slow with his hands, and
his timing was appalling. Of his courage and deter-
mination nothing but praise can be written ; but,
apparently, like many others, he started fighting be-
fore he learned to box, and now he either will not, or
cannot, learn what he should have known at first.
He had the Frenchman sorely puzzled over and over
again, and the bewildered Gaul would occasionally
plant one fist against Land’s head and hold him off
while he fossicked hungrily for an opening through
which to send a finisher. Late in the fight he sud-
denly discovered that the back of Land’s neck was
quite unprotected, and thereafter he chopped and
chopped at it. Land came with sudden rushes, and
Audouy, instead of side-stepping him, stood up to the
charge and drove home lefts and rights, which mostly
fell on Land’s gloves. But there were so many of
them served out during the fight that the propor r
tion which reached the local man’s head represented
a considerable number, and once or twice Land stood
off and surveyed his nimble adversary with a weary
expression. Then he Would crouch, put on his
peculiar smother, smile, and bore in. This blind
boring-in and the angle at which he stood —some-
times he Was almost bent double a number
of Land’s blows to go low, and he earned popular dis-
favor and official Warning several times. The end
came in the 12th round, when the Frenchman was be-
ginning td show signs of weariness. Suddenly a blow
from Land made him very angry, and he fought like
a tiger. Land rushed in with his head down ; the
Gaul chopped him on the back of the neck with the
right, and then brought a tremendous left swing,
which caught Land right under the chin and sent him
to the floor—head down, heels up—where he took the
count.
Saturday night’s fight was in the hands of
the referee only, for, like Israel of old, R. L. Baker
has abolished the judges and gone in for a single king.
The system of having two judges to assist the referee
worked much better than was expected, but that was
largely due to the fact that whenever he was present
that well-known sporting authority, Nathan, acted
as one. When he was not present the judges seemed
just as unsatisfactory as could be, and some of the
most amazing verdicts came from them. Still, one
can hardly blame judges and referees for differing
when the scribes themselves totally disagreed. When
the scribes disagree, whom shall humanity depend
upon?

The last day of the N.S.W. State Swim-
ming Championships, at the big bath in Sydney
Domain, drew about 3000 spectators and provided ex-
cellent swimming. The bill of fare included the
500vds. Teams Championship, once known as the
Flying Squadron Championship, the 220yds. Suprem-
acy and the Diving Premiership. The Teams race
was a fiercelv contested affair, out of which the Rose
Bay club struggled to the top, with Sydney, Manly
and Randwick-Coogee behind in that order. Sydney
had two bites at the cherry, sending in A and B
teams. The B team was last. The time of the win-
ning team was smin. ssec. The 220 was looked
upon as a gift for Longworth, and so it proved. The
only swimmer able to keep near him was a stripling
from Randwick-Coogee, named Page, and. he could get
no nearer than 4yds. Longworth’s time, owing to
Jack of pushing opposition, was 2min. 31 2-ssec.,
three seconds more than the Australian record, and
six seconds above the world record of Daniels Long-
worth, who spent most of his time in Sweden in a
private hospital, had determined to abandon swim-
ming, and only made up his mind at the eleventh hour
to have one more try. He had it, and has now
reached the altitude in the State Championships he
occupied a year ago. The diving was somewhat more
limited than usual; but most of what there was
showed the best polish. Rose Bay supplied the win-
ner in D. Peel, who scored 121 points, and was fol-
lowed by Tas Jones and A. Wickham, also of Rose
Bay. In fact, it was Rose Bay’s day out.
“Hee Ivee” : The W.A. Trotting Associa-
tion has had the padded mit handed it with a force
calculated to knock it into the middle distance. The
Association, which has been in existence for some-
thing over 12 months, consisted mainly of amateurs,
and gave every promise of raising the almost defunct
utihty horse from the mire into which he had sub-
sided in W.A. Then it fell foul of the W.A. Racing
Association (an unregistered body), behind which
Wren, of Collingwood, is said to be the financial
arsenal. The trouble arose over the question of
dates during the Christmas season. Both bodies
contended they were in the right, but in reality
both were decidedly wrong in contributing so largely
to the enormous array of ’Groper “sporting” fixtures.
The unregistered crowd were the first to get in a kid-
ney punch with a £2OO trot, and managed to secure
some of the Association’s performers. The Associa-
tion came back with a straight left and disqualified
?< sundry who took part in the unregistered
go ; and as it had the affiliation of the Victorian
Trotting Association behind it, the ban had a wide
significance. But, unfortunately, the W.A. Association
fell over itself, and before it could recover, received
a notification from the Vic. body that its affiliation
had been cancelled in favor of the newly-formed
club. In view of Wren’s position in regard to Vic.
trotting, the whole affair carries with it an odor
alongside which a few decayed eggs would be
refreshing.

The luck of racing. At Clare (S.A.),
Mambray Star finished nowhere in the Cup He
was entered in the very next race, but his owner
forgot about it until it was cheaper to let him
start than to be fined for late scratching. So start
he did, 40 minutes after his licking; and —being
evidently a glutton for work—he won. The handful
of strangers who backed him collected £3B 10s.
for each pound ticket, and are doubtless now con-
vinced that they profited by a deep and dark stable
conspiracy.

S. Aus. papers remain Sphinx-like concern-
ing the mismanagement of the State’s railways on
racing days. On the “big” days at Port Adelaide
and Morphettville those who “chance it” by travelling
per rail are welcome to rush in anywhere. “Classes”
count. Coming back from the Port on Boxing
Bay 31 were crushed into a compartment intended to
carry 10. Seven (males) were cuddled up in the
lavatory. On the Morphettville New Year’s Day
outing the same awful conditions obtained, with the
extra of a shower of black confetti from the engine
thrown in.
“flee Ivee”: The stewards of the W.A.T.C.
(Perth) took a considerable risk recently. Saturate,
after winning the Railway Stakes, was engaged for
the All Aged Stakes on the same day, but the stewards
expressed dissatisfaction with the apprentice who had
been given the mount in the latter race, and, taking
advantage of a new rule, ordered the boy down and
selected another lad in his place. Fortunately for
them Saturate arrested the judge’s eye. This is the
first time registered stewards have availed themselves
of such powers, although it has been done often on
unregistered courses in W.A. On the same day
Moonyoon came in ahead of his field, with Crown
Thistle second. But the stewards sniffed interference,
and placed Crown Thistle first, with Moonyoon
second.
One way and another the N.S.W. Shires
managed to bring about the defeat of the Bill which
proposed to create a Board to see that the main
roads were kept in proper order. But the money for
the Board to operate upon had been already passed,
and when ,his Bill was beaten Minister Griffith an-
nounced he had no intention of passing the money to
the Shires to play with as they had done in the days
a-rear. Now the shires are squealing They want
that money, and they won’t be happv till they get
it. And they threaten, if it isn’t given to ‘them
straightaway, to dismiss half of the local government
laborers, and let the roads generally go where the
main roads have been going ever since the shires took
them over. The Minister now offers them the money
they would have had to spend on main roads under
the proposed Board’s supervision; but he still insists
that every penny of it shall be spent on the public
highways, and not on the local roads ; and the shires
can do what they like about it. They have fallen in,
and great is the splash thereof.
The first motor-cyclist to just miss the
Dunlop gold watch was a. whizzer named Gunn, who
last week shot over the distance between Sydnev and
Melbourne in 25hr. 55min. He thus missed the
chronometer by lhr. 55rnih. ; but it was a splendid
failure. Gunn rode Dunlop tyres, and ran through
without a single puncture. It is evident that the 24
hours record is hovering somewhere on the horizon,
for the Record Book. The following
times were recently put up on the Brooklands track
by Victor Hemery, said by some to be the world’s

Anybody tired Of life is recommended to get loose on
the Mudgee-road (N.S.W.) and try to do likewise.
Arnst butted into the rowing game in
characteristic fashion last Week by offering valuable
consideration to Pearce not to go to England to row
Barry. Arnst has money to burn on his chance of
Wresting the championship from the Englishman, but
he says that if Pearce goes to England, he (Arnst)
will have to wait 12 months; and 12 months is much
more in the life of an athlete than of an angel. When
Pearce refused, Arnst innocently offered to give him
a race before he went; but Pearce gratefully declined
the honor, and asked that it be left over till his
return from the Thames. Pearce has made up his
mind to go, and nothing but the act of God or the
King s enemies will keep him back.

Saturday saw the conclusion of the eighth
round of Sydney Premier cricket, and North Sydney
rii 11 °j. x he hea P> w lth 15 points, pursued at a
respectful distance by University and Redfern, 12

The finish of the Sheffield Shield*match
stdZ" S ° Uth A i lS - and N ‘ S - Wales last u“k in
Sydney was a fine struggle by the Wheat
against fate and circumstance.' After NSW had
danced two innings and South Aus. one, the SA
captam looked at the 827 of the Ma Statersand rt
marked to his team that it required 497 to win It
was a long road to travel, but the Southern ’ men
were full of grit, and they slogged their wav through
the centuries till 412 had been piled behind and
went under by only 84 in a match with an aggregate
score of 1570. The Ma State’s win left the tussle
for the Shield in this unset condit'on:
S. Australia .. 2 wins 1 loss 1 unplayed
N. S. V ales .. l win 2 losses 1
Victoria.. .. l W i n ;1 loss 2 ”
If N.S.W. defeats Vic., and Vic. passes the wallop-
d^idid* 0 S ' A A the destlna 4ion of the Shield will be
decided upon the averages.
* * * *
Aus -'N.S.W. inter-State match
provided one record, at any rate. In all the biffing
required to compile 1570 runs, there was not one
smite worth more than four—not a solitary sixer!
However, N.S.W.’s erratic trundlers and wicket-
keeper went well on the way to record good-hearted-
ness with ‘Sundries lists of 23 and 29 —a munifi
cence worth 52 to othcr-s'd. -.

E. P. B 'arbour—only just out of his school-
boy phase---batted ably for Ma against South Vus
Captain Tru mper sent Barbour and Kellewav to open
each innings, nnd the youngster compiled 56 and 60
by elegant amd careful cricket. Another fine colt
effort was that; of A. G. Moyes, of S.A., who slashed
9o in great style.
Some of the N.S.W. colts given a chance
in the match against South Aus. made rather a
poor impression. The “googley” turn supplied by
W. J. Stack was a very inferior brand, which gained
only two for 67 and two for 108—four wickets for
175 runs. The googlies wouldn’t google. Another
to get below standard was the N.S.W. fast bowler
Cullen, whose three wickets cost 158 runs. Still,
cricket was always an uncertain game, compared
with which two-up is a dead-sure thing.

Maoriland began its annual cricket argu-
ment for the Plunket Shield with the crush of Wel-
lington on the corns of Auckland, which latter
haughty city at present holds the bauble. Welling-
ton’s effort was without sting, and the team returned
to the windy city beaten by nine wickets. For
once Auckland did not play its English “coaches,”
Keif and Thompson, and is now begging Maoriland
to note that alone it did it.

The conclusion of the seventh round in
the V.C.A. Pennant competition, on Saturday, left
’Roy with a fair-sized grip on the calico. That club
celebrates its jubilee this year, and is out for all the
glory it can annex; consequently its members were
hugely pleased when East’s score of 221 was equalled
with the loss of six wickets only. Youngster Webb
contributed 55; Colin McKenzie, who appeared for
the first time after a long illness, handed in 72, and
veteran Chris Kiernan put together 55. ’Wood had
made but 81 at its first attempt against St. Kilda’s
227 ; so it concentrated its attention on staving off
the straight-out defeat, and piled up 134 for two
wickets. P’ran, having captured nine Richmond wic-
kets for 140, reckoned the match won ; but Stewart
and bowler Macrow raised the tally to 297 before the
latter was caught. Then P’ran had to shift itself,
and when six o’clock arrived had itself been shifted
for 246. Essendon’s paltry 181 was only a joke to
Carlton, which negligently totted up and gained two
points for a victory on the first innings. Northcote
closed its innings with 305 for nine wickets (Norman
Brown, 88), and set about demolishing North; but
three veterans—G. Stuckey, W. Carlton and Time—
staved off the threatened disaster, with 289 for the
loss of seven wickets. Viewing the various games
sideways and end-on, the conclusion stresses itself
that no comet has arisen so far; Ryder, of ’Wood,
and Baring, of East, shine with some luminosity, but
no others are attractive. Of the new men picked for
the coming inter-State match, Bracher, of North,
made 13 ; and Horan, of P’ran, 9 ; Johnston, of M.C.C.,
did better with 101 against South. Bowler Hart, of
North, took three ’Cote wickets for 102. The select-
ors are now alleged to be looking over the State
school teams for promising novices.

Maoriland is sore at the failure of the
negotiations opened recently with the object of
getting a team of cricketers from N. S. Wales to
tour the Dominion. From the Maor landers’ point
of view, lily white "amateurism” in the Ma State is
far too costly a luxury to have on the visiting
list. The strongest protest came from the Dunedin
Star. One helping: “It is good to see that it is not
proposed to give this money-grabbing evil any en-
couragement from Maoriland.” An unthinking person
would imagine the paper was referring to the Sugar
Ring.

An Adelaide youth has given the police a
scare. They were called to the scene of a motor
wreck in Waterfall Gully. Never was there such a
smash; the parts had to be collected in sacks. The
car had evidently rolled down the half-mile precipi-
tous slope from Greenhill-road, and there was a
widespread but futile search for mangled bodies. Then
the owner turned up, unhurt. The wreck had occurred
the previous evening at dusk, and after looking
philosophically at the remains, the young man had
gone home quietly. He must have been thrown out
when the car, failing to take a bend, crashed through
the fence and made its first plunge. He thinks he
made the rest of the journey down holding on to the
back axle, with a wild idea of acting as a brake;
but he was a bit dazed by the first upset, and disre-
members the details. It was a gorgeous acrobatic
feat, however it was done.
The great event on Port Jackson on Sat-
urday was the race for the 18ft. championship of
Australia and the Foy Cup. Last year the champion-
ship went to Westralia, and the State sent two boats,
the Westana and the Eurus, to defend the title.
Queensland forwarded Colonial and Vanity to try
to secure it. Ma was represented by Kismet, Aus-
tralian, Arline and Pastime. The fact that Austra-
lian was in the hands of veteran Christian Webb was
regarded as a happy augury. The wind was from
the north-east; the weather all that .could be de-
sired. Before long it was apparent that Australian
was wearing the wrong suit for the day, and the gaff
being blown out, the favorite retired. But the race
was destined to come to N.S.W., for the trim little
Kismet had bolted. It was the only N.S.W. boat to
finish. The rest came to grief, as, indeed, did half
the fleet. Vanity’s mast snapped right off, Pas-
time’s jib burst and compelled retirement, and
Arline’s mast broke off about half-way up. It reads
more like the chronicle of a battle than of a friendly
race. As before mentioned, Kismet bolted, and kept
on doing it, till at the end it won with 4min. 18sec.
to snare from Westana, which was lmin. 19sec. ahead
of Eurus, which beat Colon-'al by lmin. 25sec. So
the Cup and the Championship came back to N. S.
Wales. The skipper of the victorious boat was W.
Dunn. The Foy Cup is of solid silver, stands 3ft.
high, and always contains £5O when it is handed
to, a new winner.

The thousands of good Australians of the
third generation who live with their German names
in the hills behind Adelaide worked off their rifle
“Kingships” during the Christmas holidays. Good
shots like Lake and Fielding and Hill go from the
city to compete, but never seem quite to enter into
the spirit of the thing; for instance, they are apt to
jib when crowned with oakleaves after winning. This
year local men mostly took the honors. The affair at
Hahndorf is a fair sample of the rest. Top scores:
Borchers, Hepworth, Liebelt, Talbot, Dier. Dahl and
Suessbier ; president, Von Doussa; secretaries, Liebelt
and Paech; maiden-who-crowns-with-oak-leaves. Miss
Spoehr. Also ran (all the evening), Rheinwein and
Lager Bier, both of local manufacture.

RIM FIRE CARTRIDGES
The Red w Brand
It’s very annoying to have
misfires, squibs and “sissers”
among your .22 caliber cartridges,
especially when you are about to “bag”
something. You won’t have this experience
if you shoot nothing but Winchester .22
caliber cartridges with the letter “H” on
the head. These cartridges are made in
the most complete plant in the world by
perfected automatic machinery, which in-
sures uniform and correct priming and
loading. They may be had with either
solid lead or hollow point bullets. Win-
chester smokeless cartridges with grease-
less bullets are very popular, as they are so
clean to handle. They do not foul the bore.

“Sidney S. Severn” recalls some musics :
There be many musics. The first came to
me, when I v then a little child, coasting across
from Westralia, heard the “Moonlight Sonata”
well up in its magnificence from the soul of
a master musician, as the horned young moon roce
between two peaks of a silvern sandhill. Later, I
heard Paderewski make mighty music—Hungarian
rhapsodies and Chopin ; red, swirling rages ; but only
one, the “Bee’s Wedding,” played when he was tired,
remains to me. Henri Tebbut, the night King Ed-
ward died, made Beethoven’s “Funeral March” a sor-
rowing tribute from a Frenchman’s soul to an Eng-
lishman and a king deceased. No one who heard
could ever forget.
Under the palm patch that sways in soft young
fronds above the stretch of the golden sands of Thurs-
day Island, on moonlight nights, all odorous of
orchids, Marea Nunciata, green-gold as to eyes and
ivory-white of skin, with a coronet of poinsiana in
her silken hair, curves and sways under the frangi-
panis of the Filipino settlement to the exotic melodies
of Sidora Mendoza’s mandolin. And the island women
sit round, stare-eved, in sullen silence.
A Japanese geisha, seeming sweet and simple, and
artless as can be —I remember her, too. Her fixing of
flowers and her choice of colors was complete; the
touch of ..flame-hue inside her wide grey sleeves, the
imperial, purple obi held by its apple-green strand of
silk, were just as they should be. And the strange
sixths of her samisen, snapping through the tropic
night, were hers alone. But should she suggest sing-
ing, say “No!” Her high nasal sing-song is ap-
palling.
Held up at Lakekamu, near the German New Guinea
boundary, for many age-long moons, camping in a
grass house without doors and windows, and stiff with
fear of kuku-kuku (the mysterious night-folk who
spear up through the sago-bole floors), I listened to
>ome Kiwai choruses that came from the carriers’
hut below. Beautiful they were; not loud and
shrieking as one might expect a cannibal song would
be, but soft and exquisite and wholly delightful.
Kiwais are the black Jews of Papua. Their noses
are Hebraic, likewise their trading instincts. Their
names —Mosi, Ikai, Marcariso —still further suggest
the Chosen. And their music is quite unlike that of any
other Papuans—apart from some dance-songs not for
publication. Their sing-sings mostly run to choruses
about snaring birds o’ Paradise and selling them for
“flenty tchilling” ; or requests, in honeyed airs, to
the other man, left in charge of his several wives
and offspring whilst he is away at the pearl fisheries
or carrying for “Gubiment,” that even should he (the
caretaker) steal some of the absent man’s women, he
will not take his money, too.
Melba have I heard, and Sophie Michalowa singing
for the Czar. But sweet, gold-skinned Negele, of the
Torres Strait Isles, leading her chorus of maidens,
with gay silk handkerchiefs swaying from their
wrists, in the Seagull song, cut deeper into the mind
as they circled on the cliffs at Manbiang, with the
waves foaming to their feet and the blues of sea and
sky softly swathing them.
And Mindodi, fifth of the §even splendid sons of
Bushimaiwa (the last great chief of Papua), Oft., all
of then)—-Mindodi, magnificently handsome, piping
his Binundele musics on a bamboo reed, with an
aspect of lordly aloofness, in the centre of the village
street—ah, he was a music-maker not to be despised !
“Leo Lear”: We’ve heard a lot of the
curative powers of the cat and triangles in
cases of brutality to the young, and I move
the Court of Public Opinion that a start be
made with the female barbarians who are
responsible for the cruelty to egrets. I pro-
duce the evidence of a professional bird-
slayer in Venezuela, South America. He
was employed for nine years collecting
feathers of white herons (American egret)
for the millinery trade of Paris and New
York, and this is what he says on oath
The birds only have the plumes in the nesting and
mating season, after which the feathers are of no
commercial value. It is the custom to shoot the
birds while the .young are in the nest. I have
often seen the natives pull feathers from wounded
birds, leaving them to die of starvation, unable to
respond to the cries of their young for food in the
nests above. Hunters prop up wounded egrets in the
marsh to attract other birds, and then, leave their
decoys to die of wounds and attacks of insects. I
have seen the terrible red ants eating the eyes but
of wounded, helpless, struggling birds', and many
other horrors practised in gathering feathers for the
millinery trade.
Coming nearer home, Australian lyre-bird
and emu feathers are still sold in hundreds on
the London market, despite the prohibition of
export; and not long ago the Australian Or-
nithologists’ Union got wind of an order for
400 skins of the red-breasted robin, and
blocked the murder on the spot. I’m very
much opposed to corporal punishment; still,
if, as Yawn Murray and other alleged auth-
orities contend, it is a cure for brutality,
I’m willing to give it a trial on those at
whose door lies the sickening cruelty referred
to —-a cruelty practised merely for the decora-
tion of the brainless roofs of Society.
“Singemoine” on a quaint strike: —
Has a man the right to get tight when off duty ?
Also, how many small rums are necessary to cause
a Tynesider to become blithered? These are the ques-
I ons with wnicli hug I and was throbbing at the time
the last mails left London. The right-to-drink
strike, which the cable told us about, arose from
the conviction for drunkenness, and the resultant
dismissal, of one Nichol Knox, an engine-driver _ in
the North-eastern Railway Co.’s service. His jag
had been accomplished, it appeared, on two tots of
hot rum.
As to the first question, it is contended by the co.
that the safety of the public demands absolute
sobriety on the part of the higher-placed railway
servants, both in and out of business hours. It is
a principle that would produce awkward developments
if pushed to its logical conclusion. Judges, for ex-
ample, have even more important public duties to
fulfil than engine-drivers. Some of the best of them
have been notorious tipplers. They are appointed
quam diu se bene gesserint. Is the fact that a Judge
has been drunk over-night sufficient to warrant the
sack ? And there are practices more dangerous even
than drinking. Such big men as Lord Brampton
(formerly Hawkins, J.), Lord Russell of Killowen
(Chief Justice of England) and other Judges too
numerous to mention were heavy gamblers. Russell,
while on the Bench, owned racehorses under an
assumed name; and both he and Hawkins were tire-
less patrons of the turf. Russell also played cards
habitually, and for any stakes that might be sug-
gested. Imagine the position of a Judge who was on
the edge of financial ruin as a result of gambling.
Would he not be a deadly menace to the pure fount
of Justice —the nation’s most priceless asset accord-
ing to the historians? If it is well to sack an
engine-driver for absorbing two rums, it is surely
even better to oust a Judge for making a hundred
pound wager.
And how about the British navy ? The value of any
given big battleship, both as regards human lives
and hard cash, is many times in excess of that of the
most crowded train that ever left London. A battle-
ship is likewise an infinitely more delicate thing to
handle. Yet if you were to question a British naval
officer’s inalienable right to get tight when off
duty, 90 per cent, of the service would scoff at you,
and if the Admiralty officials started sacking all the
responsible persons who so offended, the navy would
in a little while be decimated in its upper ranks.
As a matter of fact, drunkenness is not unknown
even while the naval officer is attending to his job.
Lunch or dine aboard a warship, and the mariner
whom you will see absorbing less than two small
alcoholic drinks is a rarity. There is really quite
as much intoxicating matter in one of the cocktails
which are usually handed round before the meal as
in the two rums which brought about the downfall
of engine-driver Knox.
Which brings us to the problem of how much
liquor it takes to get a man blind. But squaring
the c'rcle, producing perpetual motion, resolving the
question of what a place is, persuading the various
Christian denominations to cease insulting one an-
other —all these notoriously hopeless feats are easier
of accomplishment.
“Rubber-Neck” feels unwell: —
; i All these new diseases which have attacked civil-
ised men are chiefly nerve maladies —neuritis, neu-
rasthenia, neuralgia, neurotics —complaints never
found amongst uncivilised or barbarous people, and
mostly due to noise, the accompaniment of progress.
Every new invention brings with it more noise.
The aeroplane, the automobile, the wireless and the
telephone are the latest exponents of this racketting
truth. The noise made by an aeroplane is terrify-
ing. It is nearly as nerve-racking as the din of
the motor-cycle, that most fiendish of all creators of
discord. Tram cars, trains, newspaper boys, hawk-
ers, German bands, street organs, cadet drums and
church bells all add to the growing volume of noise.
In the Melbourne suburb where I have to live, my
neighbors keep pianos and poultry enough to stock
the London market. From dawn to dusk the vicinity
of my bedroom is racked with the squeal-
ing and squawking and shrieking of the
noisiest fowls procurable, from seagulls to
guinea-fowls. The screeching of a guinea-
fowl is the most strident of all animal sounds, and
I believe this obscene bird to be the favorite food
of the dwellers in Tophet, who are confined in the
seventh circle of the City of Dis for having been
Wowsers while on earth. Freetrade, Kins O’Malley,
the Federal land tax, women’s leagues and the aboli-
tion of my free luncheon are trifles light as air
when balanced against this accursed misfortune of
ever-growing noise, and there appears to be no way
out, because most people seem to like noise, whether
ejected bv a brace of guinea-fowls or a classical con-
cert. There is no escape, for one cannot afford to
live on a snow-capped peak of silence, or reside in a
safe-deposit where there is quiet but no fresh air.
“A Good Australian” :
“Lewis Crade” (B. 2/l/’l3) questions whether
there is any Australian city where the eucalyptus is
employed to beautify the streets. Bendigo (Vic.)
was the first city in Australia to plant trees exten-
sively to combat the dust nuisance. It now has over
200 miles of street plantations, chiefly eucalyptus,
which are a perpetual glory, bound like a tiara
about the head of the city, making of a desolate
shaft-scarred mining camp a pretty sylvan retreat.
Having seen the Avenue Thiers in Nice, and driven
along the glorious boulevard, beginning at Golden
Square and running for four miles to the Botanical
Gardens at White Hills, 1 claim superiority, for
Bendigo’s avenue of native trees. Incidentally, I
challenge “Lewis Grade’s” dictum that Nice is the
most beautiful town in Europe. Baden Baden, on
the edge of the Black Forest, and Berne, in Switzer-
land, both excel Nice in pure loveliness. Barring one in
Berlin, the finest tree-planted boulevarde in a great city
is the St. Itilda-road, once*dismal and despised, but.
every year growing more entrancing. When it has been
developed as one continuous flower-bed, there will be
no approach to any city anywhere so dignified and
prepossessing. To end fitly, I cla m that the Mel-
bourne Botanic Gardens are the finest public pleas-
ance on earth, not excepting Peradeniva, in Ceylon :
Buitenzorg, in Java; or the Jardin des Plantes, in
Paris —though I must exclude the public parks of
Vienna, Florence and Brussels.
The Bulletin wouldn’t mention it if the
London Guardian, the leading newspaper
of the Church of England, hadn’t drawn
attention to the matter. It recalls, apropos
of the war in Turkey, that un bon bougre
is “in French a popular and trivial term of
contempt for a boy,” and adds that the noun
is the modern form of boulgre, which is the
same as Bulgar = a heretic, and, therefore,
of course, a rascal.
“Y”: An oyster saloon keeper, up before
a Sydney court for having dirty premises,
pleaded that “the inspector called early on
the morning after New Year’s Day. Had
he called a little later he would have found
everything all right.” I took the lift to my
room in a Sydney residential hotel lately
just after lunch, and found the housemaid
on her knees hard at work. She explained
that the girls were all touching things up,
as the inspector would be round at half-past
three. The inspector did stalk from room
to room at half-past three, and reported
favorably. What is the use of an inspection
that can be thus planned for .' It is merely
pulling the leg of the public’s confidence, so
to speak.
THE LONG JOURNEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, I ask what would he the consequences if an
ordinary layman had travelled to Colombo with two
consumptives, and thence to London with one con-
sumptive, in a cramped cabin ? I consider it would
amount to constructive murder, as the unfortunate
innocent would almost certainly develop tuberculosis.
—Extract from the letter of a travelling doctor, who
fled from the floating tomb.
The startling feature lies in the fact that 50 per
cent, of those who came in contact with the patients
were found to be suffering from the disease. — Extract
from the report of the National Association for the
Prevention of Consumption.
He booked his passage oversea ;
His cabin it held four,
And of his cabin-sharers three,
Two sweated at each pore;
They also coughed alternately—
Coughed with a close-shut door.
Wind-puffs came faintly through the port
When ports could opened be;
But when the sea was up for sport,
'Twas closed hermeticTy ;
And the coughers twain the long hours fought,
Gasping their agony.
The bunks like shelves in some dark vault
Their shrouded burdens held ;
The blood in two dry mouths was salt
When the lungs their death expelled ;
And the s.s. Styx, that could not halt,
The rounds of fighting belled.
The passengers who did not cough
Were very patient men ;
They did not rage and hurry off
To find another den;
They used to jocularly Scoff
And fall asleep again.
One coughed for sixteen thousand miles,
The other coughed for eight;
They said good-bye with sad, wan smiles,
For each well knew his fate;
But thejf did not speak, those doomed exiles
Of either cabin mate.
The grass is green upon their graves,
But two more bear the scourge—-
The two that slept when leaping waves
Would open ports submerge ;
Of Destiny the hapless slaves,
They cough on Death’s dark verge.

EMULSION
The recuperative and|
strength-making powers of
genuine Scott’s Emulsion
result, not in temporary
improvement, but in the
acquirement of renewed
health and lasting strength.
Thousands of Doctors,
in every part of the world,
recommend SCOTT’S.
Grateful mothers praise
it. Here is an example:
" My little daughter, Molly, wasted to
skin and bone, and was so weak that I
thought she would die I was advised
to give her Scott’s Emulsion, ana now,
after a short course of same, she has
grown quite fat and strong, and looks
a bonny healthy child.”
Mrs. E. Newell, 62, Regent St.,
Sydney. 31.8.11.
Mrs. Newell got the genuine
Scott’s Emulsion—hence the good
results. Further reason why you

ANTINEURASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anasmia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of tne most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.

R. J. Bonnor: Hoity, toity, now! How
seriously you take yourself 1 As it happened, at
least 30 people had drawn attention to the matter
before you did. The first man in got an acknow-
ledgment; the others got the basket.... Anon: If
the Protestant man marries the R.C. girl, “her
Catholic lady and other friends will say, ‘She’s Jim
What-do-you-call-him’s—not wife, but the other
thing.’ ” Will they? If they do, Jim What-do-you-
call-him will probably get about £lO,OOO damages
for slander. .. .Cynicus: Vigor in it; but not' enough
skill. There is too much of the just-dashed-off at-
mosphere about it. The thing that is dashed off
usually is ——ed “off.” A.G.J.: “Northern Gar-
den” hesitated on the edge. Then it fell 0ut....
Sarah H.: Oh, yes, it might be called a poem. Still,
the term would be more flattering than defamatory.
Technically there is nothing much wrong with it,
but it is so poor in ideas... .Alba Longa: They look

way of speaking he was no friend of ours

I Ex-Secretary: There was a N.S.W. country-show
society, whose prosperity was stupendous—so much
so that its rivals marvelled. It staged more jump-
ing events, trotting races, tandem contests, fat
women exhibits, merry-go-rounds, drinking booths,
shooting galleries, skittle alleys, boxing tents, cock
shies, Aunt Sallies, etc., etc., than any similar in-
stitution on record. Years of affluence passed, and
one black day a Government official arrived and
started investigating. He found that the State was
very literally paying in subsidy money for every
one of these circus turns. The thing was worked
by the officials making the granting of a permit,
license to appear or what not, conditional on all
the vaudeville people becoming members of the
society in lieu of paying fees. The society faith-
i fully and punctually collected the subsidy money on
these bogus members, and so waxed fat. Ever since
then The Bulletin has viewed a surplusage _of
freak or circus events, having no earthly connection
with agriculture or the pastoral industry, as some-
thing calling for earnest investigation, if nothing
more K.S.: Can find no trace of the fugitives.
Maybe the post office holds the guilty secret....
Bellerive: It is again time that a dead gambler wel-
tered in this column: —
I’ll shadow the fiend, exclaimed a gambler,
Penniless I cannot face my wife,
He wilfully fleeced me of my money
I’ll claim my own if I end his life.
At the early flush of morning
A policeman returning from his Beat
Discovered the victim’s ghastly body
Outstretched on the path of the misty street.
A tragedy exclaimed the hardened officer
As he bent and raised the body grim
Whose glaring eyes and contorted features
Denoted the assassin had strangled Him.
After midnight when the city slumbered
Done to death by A gambler bold

Of the man who had fleeced him of his gold.

“Spasmode”: The Yanks are still ahead.
Only a month or two ago the Rev. G. L.
Morrill preached in Minneapolis on “Praise
Him with the Dance.” After showing how
this could be done in a godly fashion, he
went on to talk of the ungodly ragtimes—
the Bunny Hug, the Turkey Trot, Crab
Crawl, Chicken Crawl, Tortoise Tango.
Jelly Wobble, Grizzly Bear, Angle-worm
Wiggle and Seasick Glide. (Hold on here.)
The organ then played ragtime music.
(Now for the gasp.) Two ballet ladies
next mounted the platform in front of the
pulpit, and gave samples of all those
dances! Up to that date the cheekiest pul-
piteering thing on record had been Beecher’s
auctioning of an octoroon girl as she stood
beside him. This, however, was only to
buy her freedom, which ensued, relieving
her from the worry incidental to being an
escaped slave. (This, by the way, gave
Boucicault the idea of his “Octoroon,” and
the powerful auction sale, in which Jacob
McClosky beats Dora Sunnysides. “Twenty
thousand dollars!” “Twenty five thou-
sand !!” “Yours, Jacob.”) Pastor Morrill
intimated that pietists are a little too
chary of chaste dancing. Look at David,
dancing before the Ark with all his might!
And at Seville Cathedral, on Corpus Christi
Sunday, a beautiful minuet is danced by
boys before the Altar.


I'OoK at the Photographs.
They Tell a Graphic Story.
Fig 1 merely illustrates the relation of the iron-frame and the wrest-
piank (that is, the tuning-block) in an ordinary imported piano. The tuning-
pins and wires have been removed.
Fig. 2 is a nearer view of the wrest-plank of the same piano.
Fig 3 is the Beale Patent Piano Frame, removed from the piano, and
t le end of the wrest-plank cut off to show the wrest-pin in the solid iron frame.
Fig. 4 is a nearer view of the Beale Patent frame shown in Fig. 3.
Now—
The wrest-plank of an imported piano is a block of wood about sft. 9in.
long, and one and a half inches (l|in.) thick, into which no less than two
hundred and sixteen steel spikes are driven. Each spike is about long
and |in. in diameter; each one is hammered into a hole previously drilled in
the wrest-plank. The holes are all slightly smaller than the spikes, so that
when the latter are driven home the wood will pinch tightly round them.
Consequently each spike acts like a wedge in the wooden plank, tending to
burst it asunder.
But that is not all.
To each spike a steel music-wire is attached, and the spike is wrested
round with a key, thus coiling up the wire and tightening it. It is to resist
the tendency of the wire to turn the spike (or “wrest-pin”) back again that the
wood must pinch tightly upon the spikes.
When all the wires are at full tension—that is to say, when the piano is
in tune at concert pitch the total strain upon the two hundred and sixteen
steel spikes is nearly sixty-seven thousand pounds (67,0001 b.) not quite
thirty tons.
.No block of wood can withstand such a strain for long, especially in the
trying Australian climate. Remember that a dual strain is exercised upon it
there are first of all two hundred and sixteen wedges bursting the plank
asunder, and then there is the Levering strain of 67,0001 b.
Of course, the wood must sooner or later give way. The pms become
loose and the piano will no longer remain in tune.

ALL TUTS IS OBVIATED IN THE BEALE PIANO by
our wonderful patent METAL wrest-plank, forming part of
the usual iron frame. (See Fig. 3.)
The pins are merely placed in the holes, not hammered
in. The thirty-ton strain—or even double or treble that
strain—will not have much effect, will it?
And, seeing that the pins are case-hardened steel, working
in smooth, lubricated metal bearings, no amount of turning
will materially loosen them.
In addition to this advantage of permanence in tune
which is attained by our patent steel tuning system, a
GREATLY ENHANCED TONAL QUALITY TS ALSO
OBTAINED.
We cannot illustrate the tone of a piano—you must hear
that for yourself. Call and let us demonstrate their tonal

the wires. This is an average wooden wrest-plank, neither
better nor worse than is usually found in imported pianos. All
pianos with wooden wrest-planks are, of course, subject to the
above fault, which cannot be remedied except at great expense.

The Message of Sanatogen
No preparation of its kit d has ever achieved such
a reputation as Sanatogen.
Many causes have contdbuted to this unpre-
cedented result.
Pre-eminent among them is the constant prescrip-
tion of Sanatogen bv the medical profession which,
as a body, has awarded it the highest praise. More
than fifteen thousand doctors have written in the
most enthusiastic terms to describe the benefits they
have obtained from the use of the preparation
which The Medical Press and Circular states “has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundred-fold.”
Everyone knows now that it gives
To the Sick —Health
It does this by its power of revitalising the
nervous, vascular, muscular, and digestive systems,
which it rapidly, restores from a condition of depression
to one of normal action. By virtue of its composition
—pure milk casein in chemical combination with
organic phosphorus, an essential constituent of the
brain and nervous system—it feeds the brain and
tie ves, it improves the condi ion of the blood, it helps
the stomach to efigest other food, and it thereby develops
and strengthens the muscles. In this way it gives
To the Weak —Strength
and that del'ghtful feeling of returning vitality which
tells the sufferer that he has conquered th disease
which had conquered him, and is once more on the
road to health, and the p« ssibility of taking up his
life again where he had laid it down.
Sanatogen, however, does even more than this.
It has its message for those whom disease has not
touched. Everyone is capable of increased vitality and
vigour. By feeding the vital centres Sanatogen gives
To the Healthy —Vigour
so that work becomes a pleasure, toil becomes enjoy-
ment, and the whole system takes on a feeling of
btiovancy, alertness and energy which is as delightful
as it is unusual.
Sanatogen’s merits have not only been eulogised
bv the medical press, and by the medical profession,
but have also been endorsed by hundreds of the bes -
known men and women who have testified to the
cures it has wrought in their cases.
Sanatogen may be obtained from all chemists.

... EUCALYPTUS OIL
The Great Australian Remedy for
RHEUMATISM, COUGHS and COLDS.
“Billy B.”: Spencer, the cinematocrat, first saw the
kinemaeolor at New York, wnere it had been run-
ning at a Broadway house for 18 months, at prices
ranging up to two dollars a seat. In London, the
color film had been the attraction at the Scala
Theatre for three years, and 10s. each was being
asked and paid for some seats. The Spencer people
have broken all their records since the kinemaeolor
was let loose in Svdney, and claim (no doubt cor-
rectly) that, counting evening and matinee perform-
ances, the takings have been ahead of anything in
Sydney since the bountiful days when Spencer and
West were alone in their glory of no competition in
city or suburbs. Since those days Spencer counts
his booms in this order: (1) Kinemaeolor; (2)
“The Fatal Wedding”; (3) “Sweet Nell.”
A note from George Wirth: Re “Wild West”
shows. The first of the kind to visit Australasia
was owned by the Wirth Bros. We imported from
America over a score of cowboys and Mexicans and
as many Indians. They opened in Auckland in
September, 1890, reached Adelaide at Christmas of
that year, and got to Sydney in January, 1891. We ran
a three-ring circus, hippodrome races and Wild West
show under the one canvas —the largest, I believe,
ever erected in Australia, being over 100 yards long.
The site in Sydney was the Agricultural Show
Grounds. Doc. Carver opened in Sydney in Febru-
ary. just one month later. But his was not in a
tent, and Was a Wild West show only.
From London: Obstructive theatre queues have
lately been under heated discussion, and the Home
Secretary is being plied with questions on the sub-
ject. He says he is giving “serious consideration”
to the nuisance. J. F. Hogan has pointed out that
“the problem has been satisfactorily solved in
Sydney and other Australian cities by municipal
regulations decreeing that all places of public en-
tertainment must be opened at least one hour before
the performance begins.” The delay in opening the
doors is the root of the difficulty here in London.
The idea seems to be that the crowd outside is a
first-class gratuitous advt., and so it is kept there
as long as possible. That sort of thing is obviously
in urgent need of either a broom or an axe.
“Harrison O.”: The tendency in the theatrical
line these days is to give quantity and let quality go
to the deuce. Shows are starting earlier and finish-
ing later. A habit of commencing at 7.45, or there-
abouts, is one of the newly-acquired vices of bellow-
drammer. But the limit has been reached by the
“Puss in Boots” panto., which, on the first night,
started at 7.30 and finished at 11.35, although not
many encores were given. The offence is all the
worse for the fact that the said entertainment was
simply shrieking for an axe, lawn-mower and case
of dynamite. On divers occasions it was held
up while the comedians bombarded each other and
the audience with over-ripe chestnuts. Personally, I
have a prejudice against being kept hard at it duck-
ing my head to avoid these missiles on a hot night.
Theatrical managers should know that brevity is the
soul of entertainment, and the slickness of the show
deceives the intellect.
A generation ago the British Government sup-
pressed “The Happy Land” in a London theatre be-
cause it contained a trio of actors made up to repre-
sent three Ministers of the Crown —Gladstone, Ayrton
and Robert Lowe tone time of Sydney). When
Marcus Clarke did a local adaptation of the piece for
the Melbourne Bijou Theatre, with Graham Berry,
Major Smith and Jack Woods as the trio, it was also
vetoed, although a performance was given on a Bav
excursion steamer. Statesmen are not so thin-
skinned nowadays. A skit, called “Who Bosses the
Show?” is being introduced to “The Sunshine Girl”
at the London Gaiety. Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour
and Keir Hardie are represented in lifelike fashion
and go through a most grotesque song and dance.
Finally John Redmond, the leader of the Irish party,
romps on with his shillelagh, chases the other three
off the stage, and proves conclusively that he is the
boss of Westminster.
“Parisine”: The Claqueur is familiar in London.
But more important, and more than doubly paid, is
the Chatouilleur, or Tickler. He never works in a
gang, like the claque, but invariably alone. Sitting
right in the thick of the people, in gallery, pit or
parquette, his business is to laugh discreetly at the
jokes, and infect all round him with the contagion.
There is much art in this. He will see a joke and
explode. Or he will emit an irrepressible squeak,
enough in itself to set a whole house laughing. A
consummate artist in the line will vainly try to re-
press his cachinnations. He will begin to quiver, his
sides will shake, and gradually the laugh is developed
in artistic fashion. To do this night after night the
Chatouilleur must be an actor. The prime artist is
a preternaturallv solemn man who cannot resist the
exhilaration of the play; and all the better if he is
able to work up to such a magnificent steam-organ
hoot and honk of a laugh as that with which Alec
Peacock used to convulse the Victorian Legislature.
“B.B.”: A glimpse of the profits in the picture
show business in Maoriland is afforded by the recent
sale in Dunedin of the Queen’s Theatre. ’ Six months
ago the project of reconstructing this show-house
was put before the public, and the prospectus was
given the cold, dead eye. Four thousand pounds were
required for the work, and two speculators put up the
money. A few days ago they went out, and to keep
them from being downhearted £13,000 went with
them.
A teacher of dancing advertises in the S. M,
Herald that one of her pupils is appearing at a
minor local show after two weeks’ tuition. But
that’s nothing. The Bulletin has seen scores of
them who have appeared plainly without any tuition
at all. Or intuition either, for that matter.
The new Stage Pictorial, edited by Phil Finkelstein,
is about the most comprehensive sixpen’orth of joy
that the stage-struck flapper ever hugged to her
bosom.
“Penn Nibb”: Concerning South Oss’s earliest
playhouses (B. 26/12/’12)), George Coppin ran a
wood and iron hall, with a very ramshackle stage
in it, at the Semaphore, before he went into
Lazaar’s Gilles Arcade theatre enterprise with Harry
Lambert. Coppin then lived at the seaside village,
in the street which now bears the name of Coppin-
road.
THE SORROWS OF ETHEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ethel Irving has been telling a London interviewer
that she would like to play at least one character that
died a lingering death in the last act. She has never
yet impersonated a corpse on the stage, nor does she
see any chance of her artistic yearning being satisfied.
—“Poverty Point” (B. 26/12/’l2).
Pity my fate! No ling’ring “death”
Has come my way upon the stage.
I’ve never reached the “last-drawn breath”
(Alasl) or the consumptive age!
Ne’er a la Sarah, crawled the boards,
In twenty minutes’ agon-ee;
No orchestra its dismal chords
Has ever struck for healthy me.
Hard? It is hard! I've not once drained
The lysol-bowl and fallen prone
Dressed in a “nighty.” I’ve refrained
From gasp and gurgle, sigh and moan.
I've never coughed the cough (How I
Regret the solemn, bitter fact!)
Which plainly tells I’m booked to die,
Bathed in green “lime” in the last act.
No sympathy for “hollow cheeks,”
And “fading fast” parts, is my share;
No doctor'of my thinness speaks;
Fat parts I get—lienee my despair!
Woe’s me, alas, likewise alack!
What misery ahead I see —
No stage career e’er looked so black.
No corpse, no happiness for me!

SCROLL SALMON
In 11b. Tall Tins and 11b. and ilb. Flat Tins
During the height of Summer, when meat food is often unpal-
atable, precarious—and even dangerous—SCßOLL SALMON
possesses added attractiveness. It is equally inviting used <•
direct from the can, or served in any one of numberless tooth-
some ways. There is no meal, however plain, or however;
sumptuous—at which SCROLL will not play a highly appreci-
ated part. It
Makes a Plain Meal Good
and a Good Meal Better.
Mr. A. G. Hales was born in Australia in 1860,
but has lived for a great many years in England
where he is well known on account of the bril-
liant work he did as War Correspondent for the
London Daily News in South Africa, Macedonia,
and during the Russo-Japanese War. He has lec-
tured throughout England, America, South Africa and
Australia. Besides being a poet and a novelist, Mr
Hales has followed mining for years, and has trav
elled extensively in search of sport and adventure,
hew brain . workers have led such an active and
stienuous ]ife, and it is therefore interesting" to
Jearn that Mr. Hales is a great admirer of the well-
known tonic food, Sanatogen. He writes- “I have
used Sanatogen and find myself considerably im-
proved in general health. 1 am working late and
long under considerable pressure, and find that mv
brain benefits by every tin of this nerve tonic that I
take; it revitalises a man and is not a drug No
brain worker should be without it.”*

IN
BANANA LAND
_Brisbane has increased its population by
17,000 in the last 12 months. North Queens-
land (area, 330,000 square miles) is forging
ahead at the terrific rate of nearly 1000 per
annum. Queensland has its concentration
disease as well as N. S. Wales.
“Politicus”: The soporific influence of the
Leg. Council on the alleged principles of
Labor men who enter it is painfully evident
in Queensland. There are some half-dozen
nominees of Labor origin, but with about
one exception they are dumb for 90 per cent,
of the session. In fact, they are mostly ab-
sentee watchdogs.
Sundry South Queensland journals have
been busy with the rumor that “Dr.” Kid-
ston is to resign his billet on the Land
Court, and put up against Andrew Fisher
for Wide Bay. But the “bairn o’ Falkirk”
is altogether too Caledonian to take on such
a grave uncertainty as the Wide Bay con-
test, especially when confronted with the
grim necessity of a prior resignation from a
fine, fat, comfortable billet.
MACARTNEY, ex-Minister of Lands,
Queensland.
There is quite a healthy agitation in
North Queensland in favor of the division
of Bananaland into two States. It is held
that the North ought to assert itself and
not continue in a position of dependence on
Brisbane and suburbs, unable to do anything
without the consent of a far distant legis-
lature, too much given to looking after the
interests of a dominant South. The recent
five appointments to the Leg. Council, when
the North was ignored, form the subject of
much adverse comment. The advocates of
separation consider that the division of the
State would mean more population, quicker
development and more influence in the Aus-
tralian Parliament. What it apparently
doesn’t yet see is that the shortest cut to
the goal is by way of unification. That
accomplished, the scientific division of Aus-
tralia into States would happen as a matter
of course
IN THE LAND OF PLENTY.
SWAGGY : “Plenty rain lately , Tommy? ”
TOMMY : “You wanter go to Queensland see plenty rain , boss. Pained up there [?] o weeks
last March."
Premier Denham is “down South,” and
the veteran A. H. Barlow is left as Act-
ing-Premier. When a Queensland Premier
is afraid to encourage the ambitions of an
aspiring Minister in the Assembly by leaving
him to act as locum-tenens, he neatly side-
steps the difficulty by leaving his shoes to a
Legislative Councillor who, of course, can
have no aspirations. And for years and
years past the Councillor has usually been
Barlow.
Sundry magistrates and court officials,
scattered throughout Queensland, lately de-
cided not to let the memory of R. A. Ran-
king, P.M., fade entirely away. A circular
issued by his successor (Colonel R. A.
Moore), found so ready a response that
there now stands over the grave in the
Toowong Cemetery a headstone bearing the
inscription, “True as Steel.” On a not far
distant Sunday it will be formally un-
veiled.
“Boro Belle”! I enter rich Mackay in
the mean town competition. It puts off
every public holiday it can until a Wednes-
day, when the shop-assistants have their
weekly half-holiday. This, you see, saves
the boss half a day.
After chewing it over for two years, Mac-
kay has decided by three to one to have an
outer harbor costing £250,000, as designed
by Engineer Iveele, of Sydney, and the
Queensland Engineer for Harbors and
Rivers (E. A. Cullen). From Flat Top
Island, about a mile and a half from the
mainland, two breakwaters are to be run
out to form a protected basin. A ferro-
concrete viaduct, to carry a railway, will
connect the island with the mainland. The
scheme is to be commenced within six
months, and it is estimated that it will be
finished in four years. The Harbor Board,
which at present has a revenue of £6OOO a
year, has £lO,OOO saved up, and is now
knocking at the State Treasurer’s door for
a loan of £60.000 to go on with.
Do I Remember?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No, I have not been in Naples. . . .
Lord, how I lie! I, who remember
A sea like a roughened sapphire, a sky of a
harebell’s petal
And a black storm-cloud away
In the dusking of the bay,
And the sun through the heat haze sinking
like a disc of beaten metal.
And the villa over the island, and the cave
where the shy waves crept.
And the ragged loom of the hillside where
the thick-leaved fig-trees slept.
And a terrace of stone and a jewelled hand,
and eyes like a dreamed desire,
A brow as cool as a mountain crest, and a
mouth like a spice-fed fire.
To-night on the grey old station the gum-
boughs creak and sigh.
And the Southern Cross like a broken kite is
low in a moonless sky,
And over there by the iron shed I can hear
the weaners bleat,
And the howl of some penner’s restless dog
chained up in the station street.
Women? Never a one of them. This is
the place for Men ;
Greasy jobs on the shearing floor, dusty jobs
at the pen....
No, I have not been in Naples. . . .
1 )o I dream or else remember
The lure of a woman’s laughter from a light
boat drifting near.
Satin crossed on a satin breast,
Glossy tresses severely drest,
And a dull gold cross on her golden throat
and a red flower at her ear?
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January IS, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The most notorious visitor in Queensland
at time of writing is Prime Minister Fisher,
and the truth about the man is out at last.
The Courier broke the news yesterday
thus:—
It has been left to the Socialist Government, at
the head of which is Mr. Andrew Fisher, to avow
that the oath of allegiance to the King is no longer
to be required from those intrusted with the defence
of the Empire and of our land. . . .This is an attempt
to tear from the heart of Australia the. last shred of
semblance of loyalty to the Empire and the King,
and the Prime Minister and his Socialist colleagues
will be held responsible for it by the people of
Queensland, at any rate.
It is very awkward for Governor Macgregor.
I suppose he will not be able to receive this
Empire fracturer —unless he is a Socialist
himself. And really, my dear, with the in-
creasing education of the classes it’s hard
to say who isn't a Socialist these days.
And I’m wondering and wondering when
it was that the Courier took its solemn oath
to be true to Empire and King. If it hasn’t
taken an oath to be true, of course it can’t
be true. At least, I judge that that’s the
Courier s little opinion.
Senator Turley (President of Australia’s
Senate) and Mrs. Turley, who have been
in Brisbane, went back to Melbourne this
week.
The aged and much frayed question of
Church v. State control of reserves for black
brother and sister has been again dragged
into the light of day. A deputation waited
upon Home-Secretary Appel last Thursday
and demanded that the Presbyterian Church
be given control of a settlement on Morning
ton Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Appel _ suggested that Chief Protector of
Aborigines Howard should express his view
on the matter, and Howard did so with firm
disregard for anybody’s feelings. He said
the Government should retain control of the
abo. establishments; where the Church
had control the blacks were taught nothing
useful, and were mostly degraded and degen-
erate. Appel however, who seems to have
tripped over something, and turned a somer-
sault since his encounter with Bishop Frod-
sham over Yarrabah, considered that Morn-
ington Island should be handed over to the
Porridgb.vterians, and, no doubt, that is
what will be done.
The Queensland Teachers’ Union has been
holding its annual oonforonce in Brisbane.
The delegates unanimously agreed that it
was time they received a bit more cash re-
compense for the job of training the young
Queenslander to be a good Australian.
Whether the powers that be will agree with
them is another matter. I’m not altogether
certain that some of the said powers have
ever heard of Australia —heard any good of
it, anyhow.
The drought predicted by Clement Wragge
has not materialised, as any of the cane-
farmers in the Burnett district will tell
you. On the contrary, their cane has been
ruined and their live stock floated over the
horizon by floods. Nineteen inches of rain
in 24 hours was one item on the programme.
The rains have washed away almost the
entire surface of the city: but tliev were not
able to drown the ardor of young Cupid, who
has been working overtime for some while
past. The newly-weds of the week include
James Wyllie. of Wooloowin. and Daisy Wat-
son, of the same suburb. The knot was tied at
Scots' Church. Clayfield, last Wednesday
and the girl friends of the leading lady had
almost hidden the prim little building under
a mass of flowers. The wedding garment
was of crepe de Chine and honiton lace, and
the ’moon is distributing its refulgence |)H-
tween Sydney and the Blue Mountains.
Another wedding w r as that of Miss Regina
Walsh, sister of Barrister Walsh, who un-
successfully contested the Paddington
(State) seat in the Liberal interest last
election. Edward White, son of Alderman
and Mrs. White, of Kelvin Grove, was the
principal auxiliary.
Pretty Ida Clowes, who will shortly wed-
ding march Mr. Webster, of Sydney, to the
altar, was the guest of appreciation at a
handkerchief tea on Thursday afternoon.
Mrs. Boden and the Misses Kathleen Mur-
ray and Phyllis Hobbs were the hostesses,
and the amount of nose-cloth was stupendous,
or thereabouts.
John Chinaman has again been in the
slimelight. This week one, who seemed in
some danger of being hanged on a charge of
murdering a black citizen, was found to he
suffering from that characteristically Asiatic
ailment, leprosy. xVnother Celestial, charged
with sly grog-selling, explained that fear of
a secret society' had made him break the
white man’s law. He knew he had no right
to trade in illicit liquor, and had twice re-
fused to do so, but the secret society was
more powerful than his fear of the law.
Which should interest Brother Bruce Smith
and other sympathisers with our discolored
dregs.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRAIIA JANE.
“Hugh Enden”: Bananaland’s Savings
Bank lias a practice of endorsing the with-
drawal slip with the letters “WN” when
amounts are paid on demand. The letters
signify “Without Notice." The other day,
in quest of cash, I strolled into the bank.
While signing the receipt, I heard a member
of the dairying remark to a fellow-
member, “Them red letters mean ‘Well
known.’ ” After that, where’s the man
that’ll belittle expert knowledge?
Director of Education Roe told the
Queensland teachers the other day that he
once paid a visit to the school at Julia Creek
(N.Q.), and got a shock. He was sym-
pathising with the teacher on the monotonous
outlook and isolated existence in such a
place. “O sir,” said the pedagogue, “this
is a regular metropolis to me. We have
three trains a day going by !” He had come
from Birdsville —the sort of township where
the people look forward to the passing of a
camel train once a month as a feature that
brings them into line with big coastal
centres.
Through increase of population Queens-
land is to have an additional Federal elec-
torate, the Lilley. It is reckoned a sure
Liberal seat; consequently, nine Liberals are
falling over one another in the rush for the
selection, including such as “Jack” Hamil-
ton, Glassey, Foxton and Stumm. Glassey
is spreading thousands of pamphlets in which
he extols himself as the true, dyed-in-the-
wool Liberal. Apparently, he lias forgotten
the days when he was the champion of Labor
till Labor chose Dawson in his place. One
whom the others label dangerous is “Jack”
Hamilton, and it is to be hoped he
doesn’t get the selection, as he is the sort of
conscientious, manly bUshman who is liable
to reflect credit on any party he may be
associated with. “Jack” is still the world’s
champion revolver shot, and is credited with
being the best Whip the old, bad, Continu-
ous Ministry ever had.

A MAMMOTH HARVESTING PLANT.
Our illustration shows a unique har-
vesting outfit on the farm of Mr. J. T.
Pethvbridge at Pallamallawa, in the
extreme north of New South Wales,
not far from Moree. The plant in-
cludes three Sunshine Harvesters each
with Bft. comb, pulled by a Huston
Proctor 8 N.H.P. Compound Steam
Traction Engine. By means of special
off-setting devices each harvester is
made to keep its own track in the crop.,
so that the three machines take a full
21ft. swathe at one passage. This
plant has harvested over 700 acres this
season, averaging 8 bags to the acre,
and as many as 300 bags were taken
off in a 10-hour period.
Mr. Pethyhridge has also used the
Huston Proctor Steam Tractor to pull
5 McKay Disc Ploughs, aggregating 20
furrows, and has ploughed as much as
30 acres per day, and lie has used the
same Engine to pull behind it three 20-
row Sun Grain and Fertiliser Drills,
averaging 60 acres per day in the short
days of the month of June. The En-
gine is fitted with a special spark
arrester, and also with a water bath
under the ash pan, and with these de-
vices is perfectly safe for use in the
harvest field.
Mr. Pethy bridge's enterprise has
attracted a great deal of attention from
farmers living in surrounding dis-
tricts, many of whom have travelled
hundreds of miles to see the harvesters
at work. It is probably the most ex-
peditious harvesting plant so far used
anywhere in the world, and the amount
of labor required is kept at a minimum.

Craig & Aitken,
654 George Street, Sydney.
Established 30 Years.
Walch’s Tasmanian Almanac for 1913
(the 51st year of publication) maintains its
reputation for general usefulness to the busi-
ness-man, private citizen and perambula-
ting visitor. In addition to information con-
cerning the Apple Isle, the book contains
much that is convenient to know about the
Commonwealth and the various States of
the Federation.
Sydney’s new Gaud Mayor Cocks hangs
up his predecessor’s scheme for sending
drunks home in cabs under the care of
municipal officers, instead of dumping then
into lockups. The germ of Clarke’s idea
was good, but lie threw it at the public as
a sort of salvation for johnnies, and lost his
good ship for want of a pennyworth of ex-
planatory tar. Drunks are, on the whole,
an easy snap for the burly constable. An
arrest gives him a chance of a walk to the
station, and an easy jog along an hour or
two afterwards. If the night threatens
rain, nearly every Robert sweeps his beat
with an eagle eye in pursuit of a drunk.
He can thus escape the rain or some of it.
Meantime, burglaries may be taking place;
it is, in fact, common for cracksmen to get
an accomplice to feign drunkenness in order
to keep the bobby occupied. If drunks were
turned over to municipal officers it might
leave the police time to develop brains for
the higher class of work. The present sys-
tem tends to make possibly capable men
little better than loafers, and gives burglars
and other bad lots a long tether.
“Locust” : Though they didn’t know it at
the time, two distinguished American humor-
ists, L. Hop. and Mark Twain, were engaged
m complicated military evolutions on opposite
sides in the un-civil war between North and
South U.S.A. in the ’6O-somethings. Mark’s
experience lasted about three weeks, during
most of which time he was being chased by
an imaginary enemy from one hospitable
farmhouse to another, where, among sym-
pathisers, he and his comrades were well fed
and treated as heroes, until the chase started
again, when they bolted. In three weeks
Twain and his comrades gave up, and re-
tired hurt. L. Hop. had a more extended
experience, as (with a few harmless but
necessary commanders-in-chief, sub-com-
manders. horse and foot) he succeeded in
surrounding Richmond, Va., and starving
out the rebels, mainly by his dexteritv with
a pick and shovel. Since then, Hop. has had
a fixed and unalterable impression that the
pen is mightier than the pick and shovel.
His motto is, “Let me make the cartoons of
a nation, I care not who wields its pick and
shovel.” Luckily for the desperate antag-
onists, they did not meet during the war.
They nursed their vengeance through many
years until they at length came face to face
in the Athenaeum Club, Sydnev. Then the
whisky did fly.

THE

CREAM
SEPARA'
i "TOP
The keen farmer judges by results
Here is a
Proposition
The Melotte
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of the
average cream
separator.
The
Result
The Melotte
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies in the fact that
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best
cream and butter
throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay
for upkeep.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
near of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just now it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
ners, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
| her to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
| Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
a No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
,? ln °' trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
ttle Tfiey protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
clen and piercing sounds.
~ ®° - vou ma - v dearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
feound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
horn deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been

Nearly Drove Her Mad. When
Rubbed Would Have to Lie Down
and Cry with Pain. Cuticura Soap
and Ointment Gave Almost instant
Relief. Leg Now Cured.
Abermain, Via Maitland, N. S. W.—
“ About eleven years ago I met with an acci-
dent at Wollongong and I was in the hospital
g
fdg
for nine weeks and then I
could not work with a bad
leg through my accident
which left me with a chronic
ulcerated leg. At times I
have been forced to keep a
girl to do the house work for
I could not work. I had
always kept the Cuticura.
Soap in the house and I thought I would try
it for my leg and then I got to find out about
the Cuticura Ointment and I gave that a
trial and at once it did me more good than
anything I had tried before. My leg before
that nearly drove me mad itching and burn-
ing and when I would rub it I would have to
lie down and cry with pain and I never knew
what it was to get a sound sleep.
“ My leg was in such a state that although
the Cuticura Ointment gave me almost
instant relief I have gone on using it ever
since. I also use the Cuticura Soap and
keep both in the house and now I may say
my leg is cured and almost as well as ever
it was, the result without doubt of using
the Cuticura Soap and Ointment.” (Signed)

An Interesting
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half ” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S. A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
1 reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe, I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“Is bacon butchers’ goods?” was the question in
a Sydney prosecution the other day. The man was
charged with selling preserved pig after the hours
when grocers’ shops must shut. It was admitted
that bacon was a grocer’s side-line, but the Bench
held that it might just as reasonably be a butcher’s
side-line. As a matter of fact, most things sold by
grocers are side-lines. Their wares were once defi-
nitely prescribed, and included lead, brimstone,
pitch, gunpowder and cotton yarn, but not tea,
eoffee, flour, oatmeal, rice, barley, sauce, pickles or
jam. All the latter, and most of the other things
the grocer gets his living out of nowadays, are side-
lines added to his counter since his job was first
created by Act of Parliament.
* * * *
“Jonquil”: A recent decision of the Westralian
JJull Court will cause many an honest soul to heave
a sigh of relief. At the police court a licensed
auctioneer and others were charged that in selling
imitation jewellery, cheap haberdashery, etc., they
did conspire to put up prices by bogus bids. The
Court found them guilty. The matter went to the
Full Court, and the lower bench was upheld. Hence,
when a man bids half a crown for a watch, in the
hope of selling it to his best friend for seven-and-six
next day, he will know that the brotherly person
i who whispers in his ear that he “could pawn it for
more” is not an assistant, but acts from motives of
pure philanthropy. And Percy the Clerk, who has
been going the pace on 30 bob a week, less fines,
will no longer be torn by unpleasant thoughts when
his gold bangle leaves a black mark on the arm of
the heiress. At least he will know that he has not
been the victim of some designing person, and he
will cease to think suspiciously of the Wowser-look-
ing gentleman with the hooked nose who spurred
him on to bid with soft-spoken words. At least, the
new judgment ought to work out that way; but I
dunno.
At the present rate Uncle Sam will shortly retire
from the list of J. Bull’s providores. The decline
in the U.S. shipments of foodstuff is calculated to
add to his troubles in the near future. Wheat exports
fell from 102 million bushels in 1900 to 30 millions
in 1912; flour from 18$ million barrels to 11 ;
corn from 209 million bushels to 40; canned beef
from 55$ million lb. to 11 ; and bacon from
512 million pounds to 209. These figures look as
though in a few years Uncle Sam will become a com-
petitor with Bull for the daily crust, and will reach
across the border for the Kanuk loaf which now finds
its way to Britain. On present appearances it will
not be long before the herd of wealthy loafers, who
keep large areas of England locked up as game pre-
serves, will have to get work.
“B.”: Denmark, the little country with the fair
complexion and blue eyes, gets in some surprising
right-handers on commercial frauds. The latest is a law
which forbids any firm to have more than two “clear-
ing sales” a year. Provision is, however, made for
special sales on the winding up of a business, or on
a trader’s removal from one locality to another. Of
course the new law has been “viewed with dismay”
—especially outside Denmark —but that doesn’t
count for much in the scale against the sharks who
scheme to lure inexperienced women after bogus
bargains.

“S.T.S.”: Adelaide Telephone department men-
tions with pride that one of its girls attended to
these calls in three consecutive hours in the Christmas
week: 271, 312, 309. Record ? Easily a local one,
anyway.
“C.E.” : One ot the Ma State’s expensive undertakings
that earns the scornful sniff of the experienced engi-
neer is the power-house now being erected at White
Bay, in the smellful shadow of Glebe Island. The
estimate for the whole thing, including resumptions,
buildings and machinery, is £600,000; but costs
have an unpleasant habit of outrunning estimates.
About the only point in favor of the White Bay site
is that Newcastle coal, if used, can be landed direct
from the vessel. Certainly sea-water is handy for
surface-condensing, but a small fresh-water dam
would do equally well. Considering that electricity
can be conveyed almost any distance by cable with
only a minimum of loss, the power-house should have
been placed alongside the coal supply, where land would
cost next to nothing, and where valuable property
would not have to be resumed (this item accounts
for over £40,000), buildings torn down, and expen-
sive pile and concrete foundations put in. Practically
the whole of the White Bay area is reclaimed ground,
which affords no foundation at all. A tremendous
amount of piling had, therefore, to be done; and
after some of the piles had been driven in, they were
found to be too long, and had to be laboriously sawn
down as they stood in position.

“Simon”: Since a German, and afterwards a Vic-
torian, invented a machine for measuring the irregu-
lar area of a side of leather, sale per super foot
has become general. Like the camera it is claimed
that the machine cannot lie; but the operator (who
is often the boss, with an eye to the profits of selling
nothing at about 9d. per square foot) can. The
machines are rather expensive, consequently only a
few of the vendors and none of the users of leather
have them. Of late it has been found that a 22ft.
side has not been cutting as many No. 7 uppers as
formerly, and Vic. and N.S.W. leather people have
been writing themselves letters asking why. Some
blamed the Labor party; a few of them smelt the
real ’possum, but had no machine to apply the test.
A Sydney man climbed over the obstacle. He got
in a surveyor with a planimeter, had a couple of
rolls of leather measured up, and found a short-
age of 2 jft. per side. Now from Leicester comes the
news that a local firm has invented a machine which
measures and stamps automatically on the flesh side
measurement super and thickness as well. If this
catches on in Australia, it is to be hoped that the
various weights and measures offices will secure one,
in case the others in private use get spoilt by keep-
ing bad company.

“Hamer”: According to recent figures, M.L. sheep-
breeders are going nap on Romneys. There has been an
increase of stud Romneys in three years from 218,434
to 286,349, while (excepting stud Southdowns,
which only number 33.107 anyway) there has been a
falling oft in all other pure breeds. The hardiness
of the Romney, and the fact that the Maoriland
sheepbreeder mainly considers the lamb trade, are the
twin car sec cf the mild revolution.
NO ACQUISITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A proposal to cut a new street through a densely-
populated part of Prahran provoked the question:
“Where are you going to put the poor?” to which
Cr. Densham replied: “I have yet to learn that the
poor are an acquisition to any city.”
The poor we’ve always with us, true,
But isn’t it a shame?
They’re never pleasant to the view,
They are not nice to name;
And when they drift about the street,
Or take a set position
Where we their woeful looks may meet,
Or fall across their wretched feet,
They’re not an acquisition.
Their clothes are not the latest cut,
The rents are none too recent;
They seem to dodge the water butt,
Their bones are scarcely decent.
A trial this, the fat and pure
Who’ve bettered their condition
Should not be called on to endure:
A by-law to put down the poor
Would be an acquisition.
He’s not desirable, the man
Whose looks and togs are seedy;
He casts discredit on Prahran,
Makes Chapel-street look seedy;
So Cr. Densham we expect
To start upon his mission—
Another dog-van to collect
The down and out. They can’t object—
They’re not an acquisition.

BILIOUS SUBJECTS
are generally victims of Constipation, that root evil of so many
terrible afflictions ; but they are “ bilious subjects ” no longer when
they adopt the famous Cockle’s Antibilious Pills as the standing
household remedy, now in the
Second Century of World-Wide Renown.
Cockle’s Pills, which doctors of six generations have taught the world
to use and esteem, have no harsh, coercive action on the sluggish orgac^;;
they gently stimulate, soothingly strengthen and encourage, the natural
organic functions, at the same time thoroughly cleansing the system and
purifying the vital fluid. There is nothing to equal Cockle’s Pills for
this periect cleansing, reinvigorating, purifying combination of results.
It is marvellous.

iver Trouble
AND CONSTIPATION CURED
Bile Beans Are the Friend of All
Liver Sufferers.
M? GEO.TIPPING
i ( DUE BEANS are a real boon to me,” says
L) Mr. G. Tipping, a ’bus-driver, residing
in Chester Street, Teneriffe, Brisbane.
“ Through the nature of my occupation I am com-
pelled to be constantly sitting, and consequently my
liver gets sluggish and the bowels irregular and
constipated. Tie result of these disorders in the
bodily functions is that I suffer from attacks of
biliousness, with headaches, dizziness, nausea,
retching, loathing of food, and a sickly, done-up
feeling which takes the sparkle out of life and
makes work a drudgery. Acting on the advice of a
friend, to whom I confided my feelings of indis-
position, I tried Bile Beans for these troubles, and
they proved to be the very remedy I required, for
they quickly cleared my liver, opened the bowels,
dispelled all the nauseous, bilious feelings, braced
me up, and improved my general bodily health
wonderfully.
“Now, should I suspect any symptoms of biliousness coming on me, I
always go to my box of Bile Beans, and a dose or two never fails to
immediately relieve and rid me of the trouble.
“I always have a good word to say for Bile Beans, and recommend
them to others whom I sometimes hear mention of feeling unwell.”
THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
HEAD FELT HEAVY in the MORNING.
Mr. J. Webster, Adelaide Street, Blayney,
N.S.W., says:—“For a long time I suffered
a great deal from headaches and biliousness
When I got up in a morning my head felt
like a lump of lead, just as if I had not
been to bed at all. I am pleased to say
that by following a course of Bile Beans my
digestive organs were strengthened and
toned up, and the biliousness and headaches
permanently banished.”
PAINS IN THE BACK.
Wh#n the system is run down, every
particle of the spine is weakened, and a pain in
tlje back is a sure sign that disorder of the
kidneys or some dangerous ailment is attacking
you through your weakest part. A course of
Bile Beans banishes such pains and strengthens
the organs, and promotes recuperation of the
whole system. Bile Beans should be taken the
moment pains in the back assail out.
Bile Beans are
a natu r a I and
proved remedy tor
indigestion, bil-
iousness, liver
trouble, constipa-
tion, stomach dis-
orders, piles, liver
chill, general de-
bility, anaemia

When the Bronzewings Croon
at Twilight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the bronzewings croon at twi-
light and the westward skies are
paling,
Ere the white star-fires are lighting one by
by one the endless blue;
When the cattle, slowly straying, pass the
outer paddock’s railing,
Knee-deep in seeding grasses laden low with
drenching dew,
All the dreary cares of daytime for a little
space are lifted
With the calling of the river and the falling
of the dusk —
When across the dark’ning gullies the silver
moonrise mists have drifted,
And the bronzewings croon at twilight in the
dogwood and the musk.
There’s a little winding pathway through
the green and golden bracken
That leads beyond the sliprails and the
orchard’s leafy screen ;
There’s a fallen tree half-hidden, last year’s
fires helped to blacken,
That lies beneath the little creek midst fern
and frondage green.
There's a meeting by the waters at the
dying of the day, dear, . . .
Dreaming still! Beneath the bridge, there,
hoW much water has there run
Since I heard your footstep’s music, long ago
and far away, dear.
While the bronzewings crooned sedately at
the setting of the sun.
While the bronzewings crooned at even in
the quiet of the valley
To the music of the river and the reedbed’s
murmuring sighs,
And the sassafras was scenting every breeze
that seemed to dally
With the starry swinging clematis in gaily
wanton guise.
Fate gave one crowded hour then, nor seemed
to grudge the giving ;
Love painted all the world with rose, gave
both hands full and free.
“Ah. whisper to me. heart of mine, if life
be worth the living”—
While the bronzewings murmured softly from
the shelter of the tree.
While the bronzewings called so sadly ’neath
the starlight’s silver glory.
I was only, only dreaming; I have played
life’s game and lost.
And my heart has been in Hell since then,
and all that olden story
Is as ona with last year’s roses, and gone
like last year’s frost.
Yet th« river still is singing, and the white
mists still are creeping
Like a snowy shroud to-night across the
lonely, long lagoon ;
And Hope and Love and Youth and Joy in
one deep grave are sleeping,
While the bronzewings whisper faintly at
the rising of the moon.
The blackened log has rotted and the little
bridge lies broken,
Though it only seems as yesterday or, maybe,
yesteryear;
Though the river and the winds still sing
where our brave vows were spoken.
They’re not so sweet as long ago, and not so
sadly clear:
For Fate has brought the aftermath, and
with both hands has taken
What once she so briefly, and left the
empty husk.
And my heart is but a dreary house, empty
and forsaken,
While the bronzewings croon at twilight in
the warm and fragrant dusk.
Victoria.
KATHLEEN WALKER
“Lost, Stolen or Strayed.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN approaching or camping in
the neighborhood of certain little
towns away out in the backblocks,
the stranger is warned to keep a close eye-
on his horses. These places have become
notorious by reason of the numbers of horses
that get lost there. Even the quietest old
mokes that never give any trouble in other
parts go astray in these localities. Some-
times they are lost for days and weeks.
Occasionally they disappear in the night,
and are seen no more. The towns are usu-
ally well known, for travellers who have
tramped the whole district with their bridles
on their arms, talk about them far and wide,
and caution others who are going in that
direction to keep a sharp look-out. To a
man travelling with his wife and family in
a tilted cart, the loss of the locomotive
power is a serious matter. If he has money,
a few days’ delay does not cause him much
concern, beyond the weariness and worry
of horse hunting; but when he is hard up
he is faced with one of the worst miseries
that could happen him. Perhaps the cart
and harness will have to be sold to buy
food, unless some good Samaritan comes to
his assistance. Then he takes the first job
he can get, and becomes, perhaps, a perma-
nent resident in a locality where he would
not otherwise have thought of settling. How-
ever, he is rarely victimised when he is
hard up; it is only when he is known to
have a few pounds about him that he loses
the run of his horses.
The victim might search for months, and
find no trace of his lost property, but if he
offers a reward the horses will be brought
to his camp within a few hours. He knows
very well they have been put away, but he
has no proof, and has to submit in silence
to this not uncommon way of being fleeced.
One Nick Pinch was engaged in the
business at Bog Elat. In most towns there
are men who earn an honest penny by hunt-
ing for lost horses in their spare time: but
Mr. Pinch was a party who hid them with
the view of obtaining a reward for finding
them. He was the owner of a small pad-
dock or two near town, though, of course,
he never thought of shutting stray animals
up in his own paddocks. Ho spent most of
Uis time riding about, inspecting the stock
n the neighborhood and studying brands,
fie knew the run of every beast in the local-
. , and now and again he drove one or
two away to a distant pasture, where they
would probably remain, blocked by fences
roin returning, until he was commissioned
to look tor them, or an advertisement ap-
peared in the paper under the heading,
Jjost, stolen or Strayed.” He was quick to
detect a stranger, and horses with bells and
hobbles on had a special interest for him.
h reeing . the animals of the impedimenta
was sufficient at times to accomplish his
Pi 11 ’]? o®® 0 ®® > but when he wanted to make sure
ot finding them quickly he put them in a
secluded corner from which they could not
escape; and when he brought them to the
owner, in response to the usual reward, the
bells had been replaced and the hobbles were
broken.
He was always looking for droving jobs.
He met each mob of cattle that came along,
chatted with the men, and from them he got
all the information he required. He
took a deep interest in their horses. He
was a lover .of horseflesh. He examined the
brand, and inquired the price and pedigree
of every old screw he met. Drovers often
had horses to exchange, or poor ones to
sell, and this kind of dealing was in his
line, too. Being keen on bargaining, the
trade was generally very much in his favor.
The poverty-stricken animals he acquired in
this way were fattened up and sold to other
drovers at a big profit. He picked up lame
sheep and starving cattle in the same way.
His best deals were made when he got
a job of droving. He did not go very far
with the mob, seldom travelling with it for
more than a week or two. During that
time some of the best horses and several
head of cattle would be lost.
The latter were mostly cut off, a couple at
a time, in scrubs and thickets during the
day, and especially on the morning after the
mob had been counted. When the next count
took place, the dropped animals would be too
far back to be recovered. He also let a
few off camp at night when there were bush
cattle about to box them with, though that
was not always a safe practice, as beasts
on camp called after their missing mates,
and aroused the suspicions of the next man
who went on watch. It did not suit his pur-
pose to be suspected of being a bad watch-
man. His main object, at the commence-
ment, was to win the confidence of the
drovers by a display of smartness and ex-
treme carefulness.
His operations on the horses were con-
ducted in a different way. The only op-
portunities that occurred were at night, and
during his watch with the cattle. He chose
if possible, the midnight watch, if fixed
watches were the rule; if the shift watch
prevailed, he acted when the midnight turn
came round to him. Seizing the time when
the mob was quiet he rode stealthily over to
where the horses were feeding, nicked out
the one he had decided upon, and either
drove or led it away to some spot he knew,
and where the horseboy would not be likelv
to look for it. The latter would not know
the lay of the country, for one thing, and
generally, when he was looking for a lost
horse, he went back tho way he had come,
and did not search a very great distance
from the track. The party who was after
cheap horses sometimes encouraged the
opinion that the animal was trying to make
back, by driving it away in that direction
a couple of times before finally “planting”
it. Then a direction that would be consid-
ered the least likely of all for the horse to go
of its own accord was chosen. It might be
taken three or four miles, necessitating some
smart riding to get back before the cattle had
much of a spread on, and to round them up
quietly on camp again before calling the
next watch.
Having succeeded in losing one, he would
allow some time to elapse before making a
bid for number two. He had to pick suit-
able places along the route also for planting
them. Mind, he was not stealing them; he
would have been quite offended if you in-
sinuated that he was a thief. The object of
his operations was to cheapen the animals.
He was going to buy them all in the end,
and lost stock were cheaper than those that
were in hand, especially when the owner was
a drover who was continually moving away.
That was why he preferred short droving
billets to any other work, and why he seldom
travelled with sheep. Dogs and footmen did
much of the work with the latter, and he
had such a fondness for equine companions
that he felt lost when he was not
travelling in company with a good mob of
them. He also felt that he was wasting his
time.
Sometimes he had a confederate, who might
be domiciled 50 or 100 miles down the road,
or might be a partner on his own estate, or
a fellow townsman, who followed the mob
from camp to camp, but kept out of view.
The confederate appeared about midnight
at places where he was required. He took
charge of the horses or cattle that were
brought to him, and drove them many miles
away, travelling perhaps till daylight. By
that means the chief delinquent was not
absent from his post for more than half an
hour, and there was no spreading or dis-
turbance on camp that would cause the man
in charge to suspect that he was not strictly
attending to his duty. Occasionally the con-
federate came right on to the camp, and the
chief did no more than draft off the stock
that were desired to be lost. If there was a
smart blackfellow in camp, or a good tracker
within easy reach, the confederate kept
away. Mr. Pinch ran very little risk, as
every man who went on watch used the same
horse. If its tracks were successfully fol-
lowed to the “plant,” it would not have
been possible to say which of the several
men was the guilty one.
He never tampered with brands. Such
nefarious practices belonged to thieves and
cattle duffers. But he was a bit of an
artist, using naints and hair-dyes at times
with rare skill. A bottle of the requisite
material and a brush were easily carried in
his coat pocket or saddle pouch. Now and
again, instead of undertaking a night journey
and planting the horse he wanted, he led it
to the back of the camping mob. and there
did a little bit of fancy painting that so
altered its appearance that the owner would
have passed it by a hundred times in broad
day without knowing it. Having put a pair
a pair of white stockings on it. or a broad
blaze down its face, it was only necessary
to separate it from its usual companions.

DROPSY
Watery Swellings under the Eyes and in the Ankles, Limbs and Body.
The fluid you take with your food,
in a single month , weighs as much as
your entire body. *
Most of this fluid has to pass out
through the kidneys, bladder and
urinary system.
Imagine what would happen if the
outlets for this water were stopped up !
In a few hours the limbs and body
would swell to a great size with the
collected water.
That is what actually takes place in
dropsy.
Dropsy is the name given to the
soft, watery swellings which appear in
the ankles, limbs and body, under the
eyes or in the eyelids, or on the backs
of the hands. If you press your finger
into the swollen flesh the pitting slowly
fills up with the water again.
—lf you are of average weight.)
DROPSICAL , EYES.
DROPSY is not a disease in itself,
but it is serious because it indicates
serious disease.
It may show that the kidneys are
failing to separate the waste water from
the blood, or that there is something
obstructing the urinary canals and
preventing the waste water passing out;
or it may be caused by defective adtion
of the heart.
Tapping takes away the water from
under the skin, but more water soon
colleAs, because tapping cannot reach
the cause of the dropsy, and as long
as the cause remains the dropsy will
continue.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
a quick and diredt action on the kidneys
and bladder. They promote a free flow
from the system, washing out clogging
impurities from the passages, and
draining out the collected water through
the natural channels. They gently
lead the kidneys back to health and
activity, and thus reach the cause of
most cases of dropsy.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
no action on the heart, nor on the liver,
stomach or bowels ; they are solely for
the kidneys and urinary system, and
are, therefore, of the highest value in
dropsy, gravel, stone and all diseases
arising from kidney and bladder trouble.
Doan s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by
all chemists and storekeepers at 2/9 per bottle
(6 bottles 15/3), or post free by Foster-
McClellan Co.. 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

This was accomplished by driving it into a
mob of strange horses, or leading it through
a fence. The person who went looking for
the missing animal next day would notice
the white marks at a distance, and so would
not go close enough to see the brand. When
the animal was advertised and a reward
offered, those marks also prevented other
persons from finding it. Even though they
saw the brand, the rest of the description
did not answer.
As Mr. Pinch could not afford to have any
cross words with the boss drover, when he
had reached as far as he wanted to go with
the mob he received a telegraphic message
from himself, which informed him that his
wife was ill, or his house had been burnt
down, or something of equal urgency that
required his immediate return. The boss,
on being shown this, not only paid him
promptly, and let him go without notice, but
was deeply sympathetic. The impostor pre-
tended to be sorry to have to inconvenience
him after such short service, and by way
of compensation offered to “buy the chance”
of all the lost stock for a certain sum. He
said he knew the country well, and would
be helping to muster on one or two of the
local squattages shortly, in the course of
which he expected to be able to pick up some
of them, if they had not gone right back.
The sum offered was not much, but in
the circumstances the drover thought any-
thing was better than nothing.
Armed with the receipt for so many horses,
and so many head of cattle, he rode joyfully
back, picking them all up on his way. The
profits of the transaction were not infre-
quently sufficient to keep him in luxury for
six months.
Sweating was another trick of his. When
business was slack, he decided on a long
journey for a change of air and to have a
look at the country. For this purpose he
caught a good horse,_ the property of a local
resident, and rode him hard, straight ahead
to nowhere in particular, for a couple of
days, then let him go in the bush. He caught
another one there, and rode him back to the
place whence he took the first. Then he
waited, meanwhile watching closely the
“Lost, Stolen, or Strayed” advertisements.
One victim might advertise shortly; but
that was no use to him. He waited pati-
ently until rewards for both were offered;
then he enjoyed another trip at the expense
of the owners.
It was on one of these excursions that Mr.
Pinch came to grief. The horse he took
for the occasion was missed shortly after he
mounted it. The owner was an extra sus-
picious gentleman, who went straight to
Constable Murphy with his trouble. Con-
stable Murphy was also a suspicious gentle-
man, who at once put himself in telegraphic
communication with brother officers of other
police stations. The velocity did the trick. Air.
Pinch w r as captured with the goods under
him, and came back in custody. And that
meant worse disaster than mere imorison-
ment. He was practically disqualified or
struck off the roll in the country he knew —-
the country which now also knew him —and
would have to learn the geography of many
miles of new district before he could possibly
resume practice.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
Utu and Mum.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ 1 T was all along o’ Kupapa that the
trouble started,” said Cappledick, “an’
I reckon I’d ha’ bin a well-to-do cocky
only for that woman o’ Hona’s.”
“Tell me,” I said.
Old Sam Cappledick fished for the spit-
toon with his stick and hitched it into posi-
tion.
“It was 50 year ago,” he said. “Second
wife to old Hona was Kupapa. Leastways
that’s what she was till Carson ups an’ mar-
ries ’er. Daughter to Piriata, o’ the Nga-
tipa tribe, an’ pretty enough to frighten
you. Not more than 18, an’ whitey-brown
in color like a Spaniard. An’ eyes—sparks
o’ fire in ’em behind the brown. That’s
what done the mischief —them eyes.
“Old Whare-Nikau, Hona’s fust wife, was
a nightmare with long skinny claws same’s
a lizard. So he offered 20 head o’ cattle an’
a new 50-foot canoe for the young un, an’
Piriata, bein’ a greedy old cuss, let ’er go
at that.
“All the sky-pilots an’ missionaries ’ad
tried to rope Hona in, but they couldn’t fix
it, so he remained a heathen. An’ because
’e was a heathen ’e ’ad two wives.
“He had his kainya t’other side the river,
an’ there was about 300 Maoris lived in it.
Powerful fond o’ music an’ dancin’ them
natives was. Dennis would take along his
fiddle for a bit of a shivoo, an’ all , hands ’d
foot it around the camp-fires till morning.
“Dennis an’ me was camped half-way
down the river-spit in a bunch o’ tall man-
uka. There’s two sorts o’ Irishmen —black
Irish an’ red Irish. Dennis was red. Gentle
as a lamb, an’ wouldn’t step on a inseck for
fear o’ hurting it. But a rare good-plucked
un. an’ a fine man in a rough, an’ tumble.
Him an’ me ’ad bin mates for 10 years, an’
no man never ’ad a better.
“There was a pakeha name o’ Witow
lived up-river in Piriata’s village. ’E useter
come over to the beanfeasts to spark Ku-
papa, she a-makin’ sheep’s eyes at ’im.
Says I to myself, ‘lt ain’t my palaver, but
I’m lookin’ for trouble ’long o’ this eye-
play.’
“Dennis an’ me ’ad ’ad a korero, an’ con-
cluded to turn over a new leaf, as the sayin’
is. There was a tidy bit cornin’ to us from
the gum. So we got the storekeeper to ’and
over a fiver for Chrismus an’ make out a
cheque for the balance to put in the Savin's
Bank an’ buy a farm.
“It’s 20 miles, good, in from The Suit to
the township, an’ the road’s like a white-
hot ribbon. A clink o’ glasses an’ smell o’
beer fell outer ‘The Digger’s .Toy,’ so we
stepped inside to wash the grit from our
teeth.
“We ’adn’t more’n got outside the ’alf of
a long ’un when the devil’s own racket come
down-wind across the river. Horns blowin’,
men shoutin’, dogs fightin’, an’ wimmen
screech in’.
“ ‘Begob,’ says Dennis. ‘There’s Donny-
brook loose in the kainya. Come an!’
“ ‘Witow for a million,’ says I.
“We drove the dug-out across, an’, fust
thing, there was Witow tied to a post in
the middle o’ the kainya, an’ old Hona 'op-
ping aroun’ ’im swingin’ a tommyhawk.
“Kupapa ’ad dosed old Whare-Nikau wi’
a double whack o’ rum, stepped over her to
the door o’ the sleeping-hut, an’ vamoosed
up-river along o’ Witow in a one-man canoe.
They was after them fust thing in tlie_ morn-
ing, an’ caught ’em sweethearting in the
bush away back o’ Ormandy’s.
“A beat o’ paddles came up from the river
an’ two big canoes shot round the bend an’
ran up on the beach. It was Piriata an’ his
crowd o’ Ngatipas. Witow was their man,
an’ old Hona wasn’t goin’ to have it all his
own way.
“ ‘Hoi’ on, Ilona.’ sings out Piriata. ‘This
bik trouble. Kupapa t’e wahine nui (a
woman of birth). We make korero (talk)
to-morrow, an’ you get your utu (payment)
right enough.’ So Witow was chucked into
an empty whare for the night, an’ four
chaps wi’ loaded muskets to watch ’im.
“In th’ middle o’ the shindy up comes the
survey cutter an’ drops anchor opposite the.
kainya. An’ Carson, the surveyor, bein’ a.
chum o’ Ilona’s, the old chap asked him to*
speak up for him.
“Piriata an’ his crowd came over to the
trial in the mornin’, about a hundred of
’em. The whare-runanya (talking-house)
was a tight fit, so they held court out on.
the grass. Piriata an’ his tohunya (priest)
represented the prisoner, an’ Carson an’ a
Ngapuhi medicine-man spoke up for Hona.
“Real moral cove was Carson. He spoke
up fine. ‘E said Witow’d bin guilty o’ gross
breach o’ morality. ’E ’ad busted all the
laws o’ ’ospitality an’ wounded Ilona’s ten-
derest feelings. Bein’ a man o’ straw, wi’
no cattle as could be took in payment, ’e’d
’ave to pay proper in his person, an’ ’e ’oped
they'd make it ’ot for ’im. Oh, Carson spoke
fine ! ’Twould ha’ done you good to ’ear ’im.
“The verdic’ was that Hona should take
his utu by proddin’ Witow 20 times in the
body wi’ an old ba.y’nit. ’E musn’t go
deeper than ’alf a inch, an’ the number o’
jabs was strictly limited. They put a muru
(caution) on Ilona, an’ he was fined 12
head o’ cattle for not pokin’ arter his wife
better, an’ so causin’ all the trouble. ’Alf
the cattle was to go to Witow as some com-
pensation for the jabs, an’ the sentence was
to be executed at once, so as to get it over
afore dinner-time.
“Queer? A course it was. Old Maori
law was like that. But it worked out all
right afore we whites came along. Hona’s
feelin’s was lasherated an’ the jabs was by
way o’ soothin’ ’em. Each prick at Witow
was supposed to ease ’em up a bit, an’ the
fust squeal would wipe out the disgrace.
The muru on Hona was to square things all
round.
“Constable Abrams come over from
Waipu to take a hand. ’E talked big o’
arrest an’ imprisonment an’ demanded
Witow in. the Queen’s name.
“ ‘Keep quiet,’ thev told him. ‘lvanai t’e
Raw (law) —’im all right for t’e pakeha,
but t’e ritcnya (custom) petter for t’e rangi-
teras (chiefs).’
“Abrams out with his gun, but a buck
jumped on ’im from behind, his gun shot off
in the air, an’ four chaps sat atop of ’im
to keep ’im quiet. The Queen’s law didn’t
run much in old Mangapai them times.
“The Ngapuhi crowd stood o’ one side, an’
Dennis an’ me an’ the Ngatipas o’ t’other
Witow was stripped an’ strapped up to a
Iree. an’ old Ilona in the middle a-makine
'orrible faces at ’im. Carson was off to com-
fort Kupapa ’wav hack in the kainya.
“The old ba.y’nit was sharped up to a
needle point, an’ wrapped round, solid, wi’
flax to ’alf a inch o’ the point. The tqh’unya
handed it to Ilona, an’ the old joker started
in solemn-like to prick out patterns on
Wi tow’s carcase.
“Witow bled free, but took ’is gruel like
a man. I got the jim-jams an’ lost count
JDennis was that excited ’e shook ’is fist in
Ilona’s face.
“ ‘ ’Alf a inch, ’alf a inch,’ ’e ’owled
‘no more or I’ll down you like a bullock!’
“ ’Bout 16 pricks, an’ Witow let a howl
nut of him an’ fainted ; an’ Dennis floors old
Ilona wiv one on the point.
“That was enough. The two crowds was
all mixed up in a minute, an’ there was a
Morions shindy. No malice ; we fought wi’
fistises an’ wrastled each other friendly.
That’s what I like about a Maori crowd.
’They’ll fight for the love o’ the thing, if
they’d ha’ bin Dagoes someone would ha’
drawed a knife or a gun an’ spoiled the fun.
“The women untied Witow to put him to
rights, an’ Abrams rode away for instruc-
tion
“Carson come down to jine in. Bein’
white lie nachely sided wi’ us. He could
use ’is ’ands proper, an’ ’e knocked over
them Ngapuhis like ninepins. ’E ’ad a
black eye, an’ was ’appy.
“We scrummaged an’ shouted on the
beach till word come that dinner was ready.
The wahines ’ad got the ovens goin’. They
’ad cooked up ’alf the fine, an’ all ’ands sat
down, chummy, to a spread o’ roast beef an’
kumeras. Ilona borrowed a keg o’ rum
from the survey boat, an’ we kep’ it up late.
Cast thing I saw was Carson and Ilona
sittin’ by a fire, like two brothers, over a
■can o’ rum.
“We step’ ’eavy that night. In the
raornin’ Ilona’s son, Haurau, husted in our
shanty an’ shouted that the survey cutter
was off an’ ’is stepmother away aboard.
Sure enough, the cutter ’ad slipped ’er moor-
in’s. an’ was bowlin’ down river, afore a
stiff land breeze.
“And Kupapa an’ Carson, the surveyor,
hung over the taffrail an’ waved good-bye
as she rounded the bend !
“It was a bit rough on Ilona, an’ ’e was
for petitioning the Governor to send ’is wife
back, but the tribe wouldn’t ’ear tell on it.
They said Kupapa was a wahine rnrumu
fa woman of uncertain affections). There’d
been no peace in the kainya since she come,
an’ they wouldn’t ’ave ’er back on no ac-
count.
“Carson havin’ given ’em the slip, we
others ’ad to stand the racket. The Maoris
come over in a crowd an’ put a mnru on
us. They sopned up all the liquor—drank
‘The Diggers .Toy’ as dry as a sandhill.
“Ilona’s dead this 30 year, an’ Witow’s
a-living in the old pub now. Kupapa come
back an’ took up wi’ him again before the
end.
“But Dennis an’ me never got that
farm !’’
