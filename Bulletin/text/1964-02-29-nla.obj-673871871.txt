National Notebook
Underprivileged
HThe Sydney visitor to Melbourne was
talking in the pub. “I’ve got my
kid with me, and we’ve had a pretty
good time. You know what he wanted
to do more than anything else? Have
a ride on a tram. So we caught a tram
in Swanston Street and went out to St
Kilda. He thought it was marvellous.
You’ve got to understand he’s a Sydney
kid. This was the first tram he had
seen.”
Naturally all this has evoked some
excitement in Melbourne. If Melbourne
can only hang on to those trams for long
enough they will become a tourist
attraction.
Britain Abroad
\ lthough the British Council is now
30 years old, its staff almost invari-
ably have to face as the first question,
“And what exactly does the Council do?”
The Director-General of the Council, Sir
Paul Sinker, at present visiting Australia,
has to answer this one too.
“People confuse us with
the Arts Council,” he told
a Sydney Press conference.
“They think of us sending
around art exhibitions and
dramatic companies. Only
two per cent of our work
is in drama and music. The rest is
educational.”
The Council now has an annual budget
of £12,500,000, mainly from public
funds. It has gone from £4,000,000 to
this in the past six years. Four-fifths of
this is spent in the developing countries,
with Asia absorbing more than any other
continent (although a technical assistance
fund, linked with the Council's work,
spends more in Africa than elsewhere).
India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Iran and Indo-
nesia head the list of 80 countries where
the Council spends money.
The main work is teaching English.
This is almost always on university or
higher technical training level. Sir Paul
said that the Council was perhaps at the
moment hampered by the shortage of
“first class chaps” rather than by lack
of funds. Some of the “first class chaps”
come from the teaching services in
Britain's former colonies, although many
of the teachers stay on in these countries
after independence.
During his visit to Australia he will
discuss with Australian authorities ways
of getting closer co-operation in British
and Australian educational efforts in
Asia. “I would like to see Australia doing
more in Asia,” he said. “Not that you
are not already doing as much per head
of population as Britain, but Asia seems
a place in which Australia can take the
lead. Actually, Australia was sending
English teachers to Indonesia before the
British Council began this work and long
before the American Peace Corps was
heard of.”
Sir Paul said that, although it wasn’t
for him to suggest it, some sort of Aus-
tralian Council might co-ordinate work in
the field of overseas education. This was
at present dealt with by several different
bodies here. “It could make a tremendous
export of culture from Australia,” he
said. “I saw the exhibition of Australian
art at the Tate and you are certainly
leading the field in modern art in the
Commonwealth.”
Detail
Tn its recent brochure on “Historical
-*• Buildings, Liverpool and Campbell-
town” the Cumberland County Council
prints a ground plan of “Varroville”,
a building at Ingleburn
alleged to have been built
and occupied by Dr
Robert Townson in the
first quarter of the 19th
century. The ground plan
for the house was “sup-
plied by arrangement with
the Cumberland County Council” by
“four students of architecture and build-
ing, University of NSW”. It indicates,
among other rooms, the location of the
“surgery”. Townson was a Doctor of
Laws.
Philosopher
TA/Wid M. Armstrong (Geelong
Grammar, RAN, Sydney University,
Oxford), who was appointed last week to
the Challis Chair of Philosophy in Syd-
ney will—to judge from acknowledg-
ments in his books be continuing at
least something of the Andersonian tradi-
tion in Sydney philosophy. But, fortun-
ately, he has broken with one fine old
(or lazy?) tradition of most of Ander-
son's former disciples and actually pro-
duced three well-received philosophic
works on perception and is working on
a fourth, tentatively called “A Materialist
Theory of Mind”. When not studying
philosophy as an undergraduate he won
the City of Sydney Chess Championship
in 1946, and in 1949 wrote a history
thesis on the 19th century Labor move-
ment. Since then his interests have
expanded as befits a resident of Mel-

bourne’s old Eltham to include
literature and collecting paintings (Clif-
ton Pugh’s portrait of him was in a
recent Archibald exhibition).
On the Who’s Who level, back-num-
bers show his great-grandfather as a
Captain in the Royal Navy, his grand-
father as Director-General of Health in
NSW, his father (now retired) as a
former Director of Ordnance and Under-
water Weapons in the RAN. His
maternal grandfather was R. R. Marett,
the prominent British anthropologist.
As for Professor Armstrong’s style of
philosophising, the “London Times’ Lite-
rary Supplement” had this to say when
reviewing his three books in 1962: “Mr
Armstrong is an admirably business-like
philosopher. His writing is plain, clear
and colloquial. He uses examples but
does not wallow in them. Philosophy for
him is first and foremost argument and
he deploys it with impressive fair-mind-
edness. When an argument is not coer-
cive enough to do what he would like it
to do he makes clear what he is up to
and how far he thinks he has succeeded.
He is aware of the conventional pieties
of the philosophical avant-garde but
undemonstratively disrespectful of them.
These three books are valuable not only
as contributions to the theory of per-
ception but also as examples of open-
minded and uncompromisingly reason-
able philosophical technique”.
That seems good enough to The
Bulletin. In any case his wife is The
Bulletin's Melbourne theatre critic.
Siamese twins
HThe isolated Victorian goldmining
town of Woods Point made news
recently when equipment from the mine,
the Morning Star, was auctioned off. The
mine closed about six months ago, and
the auction was looked upon (but not
accepted) by the local people as the
death knock for the 103-year-old settle-
ment. However, fresh hope came when
Melbourne company director Mr J. E.
Johnson bought the mine lease on behalf
of a syndicate, and announced that the
syndicate would work the mine.
If so, it will not be the first time the
Morning Star or the nearby Al mine
have been reprieved. Both are locked in
deep bush, about 10 miles from each
other. At the moment, the Al mine is
operating very profitably, and looks like
continuing to do so for many years. But
on occasions in the past, positions have
been reversed with the Morning Star
making fortunes and the A 1 moribund.
In the boom days of the 1860 s, the
area’s population rivalled that of Mel-
bourne. It contained 91 hotels, 14 wine
merchants, eight breweries, 19 billiards
saloons, 12 grocers and 40 auctioneers.
Almost everything was transported in
over razor-back ridges by packhorses
from Warburton. It was no place for
weaklings, and a prospector had to prove
he was capable of carrying his own 501 b
pack along the trail before he was
allowed in. Nevertheless, it was a third-
rate hostelry which could not boast a
largish troupe of dancing girls. The town
had its own crier.
Today there is a feeling of prosperity
at Al. Some weeks, the mine produces
better than 500 ounces of gold.
Over at Woods Point, the hotel still
does good business, and by closing time
usually rocks with an uninhibited din. It
is a concrete building with the thick,
streamlined, ugliness of the 19305.
Despite the dismissals, there is no
gloom. Many of the miners have drifted
away “to the Al, the Isa and the West”.
They are by nature independent people,
trenchant with outsiders, but with a
strong mateship among themselves.

PLAIN ENGLISH
King James and Judge Rapke
TN its criticism of the Victorian
Attorney-General, Mr Rylah,
for having publicly criticised Judge
Rapke over his alleged leniency in
reducing a man’s prison sentence,
the Victorian Bar Council leaves the
biggest question unanswered.
Speaking for the Bar Council,
Mr M. Mclnerney, QC, made
two quite separate points. On the
one hand he claimed that Mr Rylah
did not know the evidence on which
Judge Rapke decided to reduce the
sentence from two years to three
months sworn and uncontradict-
ed evidence including evidence from
a member of the police force about
the effort which the prisoner had
made and was making to reform
himself. If this is so, then it seems
to demolish Mr Rylah’s argument,
and he should not have made any
public statement at all without
checking his facts.
But the Victorian Bar Council
went further. Mr Mclnerney also
said that the Attorney-General
should not criticise a Judge because
“judicial officers should be free to
adjudicate in all matters before
them without fear of Executive pres-
sure or influence” and that the Bar
Council is naturally (and rightly)
“concerned to ensure that the in-
dependence of the judiciary is not
undermined.” He prefaced this,
however, with the remark: “Whilst
not denying to any person the pri-
vilege of legitimate criticism of a
judicial determination ...”
And there is the obvious pro-
blem. All men are to be free to
criticise except an elected dele-
gate of the public. It is one thing to
say the Minister was foolish; it is
another to deny him the right of
criticism because his criticism might
undermine the rule of law.
If Judges are not to be sacred
cows, they must be criticised when
they deserve criticism and who is
better placed to do this than
an Attorney - General? If it is
suggested that such a Minister
should be more “discreet’ and
not engage in public criticism
but act privately, Jhen do we really
want public affairs conducted secret-
ly behind the scenes away from pub-
lic scrutiny?
There are no obvious and im-
mediate answers to these ques-
tions, because the also be-
lieves in the independence of the
judiciary and its separation from
the Executive. This is an old, and
historic, problem, and already was
so in the time of King James and
Lord Coke. But the Bar Council
of Victoria and other States would
be well advised to prepare a search-
ing report on their view of this
matter instead of giving the public
confusing and inconsistent guidance
about democratic rights and the
sanctity of judges.
It is a problem that has come up
twice recently in Victoria and may
continue to crop up there or in
other States. A consistent policy
from the Bar Councils is essential.
T'HE new proposal to sweep away
A all the old protective legislation
for the Northern Territory’s 18,000
full-blood aborigines is no less wel-
come for being inevitable. With
the end of paternalistic colonisation
in New Guinea there remains even
less justification for it within Aus-
tralia.
The proposed legislation will
make it legal for aborigines to
drink liquor and for white men to
associate in any way with aborigin-
al girls; and it will remove all con-
trol over the movement and
employment of aborigines and
put aborigines employed out-
side reserves on equal footing
with white employees. In other
words it makes the races legally
equal, and more or less puts the
Director of Welfare out of a job,
except for his remaining responsibi-
lity to those in need of assistance
and education. Further the legis-
lation will also give the aborigines
the additional privilege of reserved
areas which no white man may
enter without the Director’s per-
mission, subject to a penalty of
£5OO or two years’ jail.
There is no doubt there will be
some opposition to this move
among the white Australians in the
Northern Territory; this was ob-
vious and organised even when it
White Laws, Black Men
was believed that the only reforms
W'ould be over the right to drink
liquor freely. Even in Western Aus-
tralia the latest legislation is to ex-
periment with one “liquor area” to
see how aborigines behave when
free to drink legally, before ex-
tending this freedom to the rest
of the State. The fact that, for
example, in NSW the right of
aborigines to drink freely has led to
no serious incidents seems to con-
vince no one of the soundness of
such ■ “sweeping” legislation, al-
though, of course, it should.
The plain fact is that, given the
temper of the times, one has no
choice but to treat all men as equal,
even if some seem not to be “ready”
for full freedom. (If one wants to
be really tough-minded about it, it
may be said there are a number of
white men who are not “ready”
for freedom.) The world at large,
and Australians in particular, are
opposed to discrimination on racial
grounds and the sooner any anom-
alies are cleared up in our own
domestic affairs the better. There
may be problems, but we must and
will solve them as best we can on
the basis of freedom and equality,
not discrimination in particular
by following up the “decolonisa-
tion” of aborigines with a full social
and educational programme.

AIRLINES
Qantas, Sir Robert
and the Pilots
Intervention behind the scenes
SIR ROBERT
Questions
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
HThe agreement reached last Friday that
Mr D. G. Apsey, a retired Common-
wealth Conciliation Commissioner, should
act as a private mediator on the issue
of rest time for Qantas pilots was the re-
sult of behind-the-scenes, but firm, Gov-
ernment intervention in the dispute. What
the agreement signifies is a possible pat-
tern for future industrial relations be-
tween the pilots and Qantas. It also goes
further in setting a precedent for a
particular kind of Government action
in disputes where deadlocks seem un-
breakable.
The ground-work for the intervention
was laid at a late afternoon meeting in
Canberra on Tuesday of last week in the
Prime Minister’s rooms when Sir Robert
conferred with the Minister for Civil
Aviation, Senator S. Paltridge and the
Minister for Labor and National Service,
Mr W. McMahon. Relations between
the pilots and Qantas management were
now so bad that the previous weekend
had seen a three day stoppage, costing,
it was estimated, £300,000 in revenue.
The Government also had to consider a
long drawn out history of strife between
the pilots and Qantas.
In 1957 there was a nine-day strike,
with dismissals. In 1961 there was a
strike ballot which, however, was not
followed by an actual stoppage. The
strike this month had been accompanied
by bitter exchanges in advertisements.
The predecessor of the Australian Fed-
eration of Airline Pilots was fined £2OOO
for a 1958 domestic airline stoppage and
since then the new Federation has not had
itself registered. One has to look to the
waterfront to find comparable bitterness.
But the Government has £17.7 million
in shareholders’ funds and more than
£2l million in loans and advances tied up
in Qantas. Further, it is likely to be asked
soon to find many more millions for
supersonic aircraft. Although the meeting
between the Prime Minister and his two
Ministers was not followed by any
official communique these considerations
must also have been very present in their
discussions.
While Qantas is totally owned by the
Government, it has remained a self-
running company, not subject to controls
in the same way that a Government
department is and subject to fewer con-
trols than, say, Ansett-ANA. But where
the financing of the vitally necessary
expansion programmes for a competitive
international airline remains largely the
responsibility of the Government, then its
influence, where applied, must be deci-
sive.
After the Tuesday meeting and be-
fore the scheduled meeting between the
pilots and Qantas there were ’phone
calls between the parties and people who
could talk clearly and bluntly on
behalf of the Government. It is easy to
deduce from the known facts that the
Minister for Labor, Mr McMahon, must
have played a big role in the discussions.
The concept of using a mediator or some
similar formula to resolve the apparently
irreconcilable is one that he advocates.
Further, when the first mediator did
emerge, it was the secretary to his De-
partment, Mr H. A. Bland. What was to
come out of the next round of talks,
held in Bland's office in Melbourne on
Thursday and Friday, was the appoint-
ment of Mr Apsey.
It is far-fetched to see the Government
approval of the mediator as a symbol of
radical change in the existing arbitration
pattern, but it is an indication that the
present system has tended to become
too rigid at the Conciliation Commis-
sioner level to deal with cases like the
pilots’ dispute. What the mediator can do
is bring together top management and
union leaders to try for a break-through
in situations where the industrial officer-
union official talks may get nowhere.
According to the pilots the lack of auth-
ority to negotiate by industrial officers
has been one of the main factors in this
dispute.
WAGES
The Big Case
Six deep up Swanston Street
FROM D. MCDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
llftTH a Town Hall rally and banner-
” waving march through the middle
of the city, unionists provided a colorful
opening to the 1964 Basic Wage Case in
Melbourne last week. This will be Aus-
tralia’s biggest wages hearing for many
years.
Unlike previous cases, where Arbitra-
tors merely had to indicate a certain
monetary increase to settle the argument,
this year’s hearing must also decide on
whether the Basic Wage should be
abolished altogether and the employers’
suggestion of a total wage introduced.
The unions are vigorously opposed to
the total wage concept as an attempt to
“prevent wage justice” and are cam-
paigning for a 525. basic increase to
£17.155.
More than 2,500 shop stewards, union
officials and job representatives gathered
in the Town Hall on Wednesday to hear
their leaders’ call for full support of the
ACTU’s proposals and run the em-
ployers’ plans into the ground. Work at
our famous Cultural Centre in St. Kilda
Road stopped completely when 150
building workers walked off the job at
nine o'clock. After giving unanimous
support to a resolution backing the
union’s claims the rally marched six-deep
up Swanston Street, down Bourke and
Queen Streets to the Commission building
in Law Courts Place.
But alas, their procession collapsed
into anti-climax when they found that
the hearing had been adjourned. Some of
them decided to patronise the pub on the
Queen Street corner (the bartenders drew
more beers per minute than they ever
had before).
Actually, the hearing had opened at
10.30 that morning but was adjourned to
noon after twelve minutes. The President
of the Commission, Sir Richard Kirby,
had put forward a proposal that the three
cases involved be treated in the order
they were filed and then an overall
decision would be given at the end. He
adjourned to allow the parties to form
an opinion of his plans. The cases are
a variation of the pastoral industry award
in regard to the basic wage (AWU), and
a total wage embracing the basic rate plus


margins (sought by the employers), and
the ACTU case.
At 2.15 that afternoon and from 10.30
on Thursday the councils for the three
parties, plus one for the Commonwealth
which is intervening, put forward their
various views on the proposed procedure.
The Court, packed with around 150
spectators (mainly union reps.) and about
two dozen men at the Bar table, heard
the four opinions which differed from
the employers’ virtually complete opposi-
tion to the Commonwealth’s near agree-
ment. As it turned out, the whole business
proved to be something of a farce
because on Friday morning, Sir Richard
announced that the Commission’s original
procedure plans would be used despite
all the arguments raised against them.
This is going to make things rather
difficult for Mr J. Robinson the employ-

Of course the problem will work the

As the cases must necessarily interlock
and oyerlap to a considera ble degree,

leaving all parties free to argue effectively
and fully on any point.
BUSINESS
What Price Moonie Oil
Should Moonie crude be used at all?
SIR WILLIAM
Intervention
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Tn the light of the world oversupply
of crude oil, and the obvious cost
advantage to international oil companies
monopolising the Australian refining in-
dustry in obtaining supplies from their
own tied fields in the Middle and Far
East (where costs of extraction would
be lower than those probable for the
Moonie field), it is understandable that
the disposal of crude oil from Moonie
has posed some problems for the Union-
Kern-AOG Group.
But at no stage since AOG’s Managing
Director, Mr T. W. M. Dee, first officially
commented on these problems on
February 14, has the company expressed
anything but confidence that a “satis-
factory” price would be obtained for
Moonie oil.
It has to be admitted, however, that
the public airing of the problems con-
sequent on Mr Dee’s first statement on
February 14, has greatly increased the
likelihood that a satisfactory price will
be obtained, even though his original
intention in making that statement may
have been simply to dispel rumors of
difficulties in the negotiations which had
been adversely affecting the price of
AOG shares on the Stock Exchanges.
For a while most people had only
been guessing at the prices being offered
by the two most logical customers, Shell
and Caltex who, until the completion
of the Ampol and Amoco refineries near
Brisbane, have the nearest big refineries
to the Moonie pipeline terminal.
Naturally the parties involved will not
reveal prices, but, according to one
view, the refineries had offered between
£1 Is. 4d. and £1 3s. Id. a barrel
for Moonie oil, whereas on the basis of
the price being paid at the Sarawak
(Borneo) seaboard for inferior crude oil,
the price of Moonie oil should be at
least £1 6s. 9d. a barrel. As a very
high (43 gravity) quality oil, realistically
it should fetch more than the £1 7s. 7d.
present price of Venezuelan oil (41
gravity).
The suspiciously minded (and these
include Australian Tax Commissioners
who have been arguing the matter with
the refining companies for years) have
long been convinced that these higher
prices paid by our refining companies
for crude oil imported from their tied
fields overseas are made artificially high
so that the bulk of the profit on it by-
passes them (and our Taxation Com-
missioner) and is taken direct into the
accounts of group companies overseas.
Assuming this is the case (and there
presumably being no question of export-
ing Moonie oil), there would seem to
be good public grounds for not putting
pressure on the oil companies to pay
international prices for Moonie oil. and
in the hope of getting lower prices for
petroleum products here, have the
Moonie people settle for something less.
Conceivably this could be used as a
lever to get a more realistic system of
pricing for the remainder of the crude
oil refined here.
Naturally this is not the way either
the refining or the oil search groups
want the issue to be resolved, and as
Mr Eric Avery, head of the Associated
Australia Oil group, said: “I cannot see
why the refineries would not be anxious
to pay the formula price without rebate
in order to establish the validity of the
prices they have been paying for their
overseas supplies.” Moreover, and here
he seems to be on more debatable ground,
he thinks that an “uneconomic” price
would be a severe setback to oil search in
this country because it would mean that
companies would have to look for richer
fields than those which might formerly
have been considered workable.
As the Queensland Government is
powerless to force refining companies
operating in other States to pay any par-
ticular price for Moonie oil and has to
await the completion of the Ampol and
Amoco refineries in its State to get into
the price argument, it has passed the ball
to the Federal Government which if its
direct power (through Customs and Ex-
cise) to influence the negotiations is also
very limited might achieve something by
personal intervention along the lines
being arranged by Sir William Spooner.
But from a national angle the
much bigger question is why with the
Moonie field comprising Australia’s only
reserves of crude oil and given the need
to conserve crude underground for
defence needs, this crude should be sold
and currently consumed AT ALL. One
has only to reflect on the high cost and
inconveniences in terms of human lives
as well as the economics involved in
importing oil during the last war to
sec the point of that.
TASMANIA
The Premier’s
Dilemma
Mainland Money for the CP
FROM A LAUNCESTON CORRESPONDENT
npASMANiA is always a conundrum for
A political seers. Just now, with a
general election mandatory within four
months, it’s a nightmare, largely because
the Government, long committed to flat-
out development of the State’s hydro-
electric power resources, has over-sold
water reserves in a long period of un-
usually low rainfall, leaving Premier
Reece a gambler’s straight choice:
whether to have an election under
a threat of power cuts, or to hold off in
the faint hope of providential rain in
the next few weeks —with the certainty
that it could not survive if it had to


restrict power before going to the elec-
tors.
The Denison by-election left Labor
more pessimistic than it was on the night
of November 30. The almost unknown
young Adrian Gibson won the seat by
almost as many votes as the late Athol
Townley won by on November 30. The
DLP is also satisfied; it lost the donkey
vote it won in last year’s election because
this time its candidate senior came low
on the list, but otherwise its vote held
firm and it may even have increased a
little. The ALP’s failure shattered its
hopes of winning back a fourth Denison
seat at the State poll.
Into this situation the Country Party
has intruded.
The men endorsed by the CP are
enthusiastic. The party has drive,
money (from mainland Federal sources,
presumably) and no inhibitions about
backing innovations which the Govern-
ment has spurned and the Liberal Op-
position has not pushed with any con-
viction.
The candidates have been introduced
in big newspaper advertisements. “Here
are my teams,” 1962 world champion
Graham Hill says, beaming down from
the top corner of the page across the
ranks of candidates’ pictures. “Are these
the faces of theorists and dabblers in
wild socialistic experiments?”
But the Country Party cannot be given
hope of any real success. To take even
six seats, the party would have to win
two seats in one electorate at least. Its
strong team may pick up a seat in Brad-
don and perhaps one in Franklin. It has
another good chance in the Launceston
urban and suburban seat of Bass, in
which Liberal and Labor teams are weak
and the Country Party team is very
strong. It has little show in Wilmot,
where both other teams are very strong.
And in Denison it appears to have no
chance at all.
The stern fact is that the Country
Party to be successful must (a) help the
Liberals to oust the Government, and
(b) work as junior coalition partners.
If it splits with the Liberals it will win
seats. Yet the Country Party’s tactics
almost inevitably guarantee a widening
of the split. The party won’t ask sup-
porters to give preferences to Liberals —-
because it believes that an agreement on
the exchange would reduce its bag of
Labor voters.
PLAYING AT SOLDIERS
80 Years Ago: March 1, 1884
XpROM the estimates for the year
-*■ 1884 it appears that the sum of
£83,000 is required for the mainten-
ance of the Army of New South
Wales. Inasmuch as the total number
of troops is given as 2650, each war-
rior, taking them' all round, will cost
the colony no less a sum than £3l.
This is about ten times as much as
the average cost of a Canadian or
Swiss, and considerably more than
that of either a German or a British
soldier. The sole consideration that
could possibly justify the abnormally
high military expenditure of New
South Wales would be the exceptional
efficiency of the defence system secur-
ed by it. But the quality of both
officers and men of the Permanent
Force is below third-rate. A large
majority of the [extravagantly paid]
officers, as was clearly evidenced by
the recent examination revelations,
are utterly unfitted to be instructors
and leaders in what should be pre-
eminently a scientific corps; and, as
a natural consequence, the rank and
file are—what they are.
The New South Wales Army, as
at present constituted, must be abol-
ished. New South Wales should lose
not a moment in endeavoring to
amend her way, by dropping the ab-
surd notion of maintaining an aristo-
cratically modelled military toy where-
with to play at soldiers, and going in
for securing, as speedily as may be,
that “cheap defence” of a sensible
nation—a scientifically trained, prac-
tically equipped, hard drilled, and
democratically organised Volunteer
Force.
SCIENTOLOGY
In Pursuit of Thetas
At £4/14/6 on hour
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
first days of evidence of the in-
A quiry conducted by Mr K. V.
Anderson, QC, into Melbourne's sciento-
logists, centred on such concepts as the
possibility of a person’s previous existence
on earth and the separation which can be
made between spirit and body.
While any discussion on such topics
lends itself to controversy, the inquiry’s
job is ever made difficult because of the
complicated jargon the scientologists em-
ploy in their work. This has constantly
required explanation by Mr Peter Wil-
liams, the “continental” Director in
Australia and New Zealand for the Hub-
bard Association of Scientology Inter-
national.
Mr. Williams, a young looking 28,
with a regimental-type striped tie enun-
ciated the thesis that Scientology (which
operates from a pinkish coloured build-
ing only a stone’s throw from the
harsh realities of Victoria’s Parliament
House) was based on “scepticism”, “in
other words, the individual should not
accept things without thinking them
over”. Furthermore, it was “science of
knowing”, not of ideas.
The somewhat prosaic atmosphere of
the National Herbarium in the Botanic
Gardens heard evidence from Mr Wil-
liams on the technicalities of Scientology.
He talked about the eight “dynamics” or
“zones of existence” through which a
client can progress from zero to seven.
At the end of stage four he can become
a “MEST clear”. MEST stands for
matter, energy, space and time. Such a
person, Mr Williams said, is happier,
more efficient.
The last three stages are not available
to the public but only to “MEST clears”
(about one of these is produced in Mel-
bourne every four to six weeks) who
intend to become scientologists. The
ultimate peak of the whole course is to
become “theta clear”. In this largely
theoretical state Williams (himself only a
“MEST”) says spirit and thinking are not
dependent on the body. A "thetan’s” chief
advantage is that he can exist without
respect for laws governing the human
form. He says no “thetans” exist in Aus-
tralia.
Williams told the attentive Commis-
sioner that a “thetan” could read a book
from two countries away or knock off a
hat at 50 yards.
The constant references made at the
inquiry to L. Ron Hubbard, the world’s
highest scientologist, suggests that he may
be a necessary witness. He lives in an
£lB,OOO mansion he bought from the
Maharajah of Jaipur in 1959 in England.
Born in 1911 at Nebraska he has been
a prolific writer of pulp fiction and work-
ed at science-fiction and movie scripts. He
did occasional stints on radio and has
also played the banjo on the air.
Later in the week getting down to facts
and figures Mr Williams told a court that
“processing” of those who set out to
become scientologists cost £4/14/6 an
hour. A full processing normally took 25
hours.

Four years ago, at age 36, this
man took out a Customlife policy,
with guaranteed insurability.
Today, although stricken with a
heart attack, he is exercising his
option to increase his cover by
£s.ooo—the amount of his
original insurance.
It is granted without question.
Without penalty rate.
This option is possible through
our “Guaranteed Insurability”
plan. Briefly, it guarantees you
the right to increase your life
assurance cover periodically with-
out the need for further medical
examination—regardless of the
state of your health at any of the
option dates.
Customlife realises that one cannot
depend on constant good health, and,
realising this, provides for your protection
in the event of any illness at any time.
Customlife is increasing
this man’s life assurance policy
That’s what we mean by “Guaranteed Insurability”!
Let’s look at specifics:
From birth to age 40, it is possible for
you to increase the cover on your life
five times. Option dates exist at ages 24,
28, 32, 36 and 40 to increase cover by
an amount not exceeding the original sum
assured . . . which can be up to £5,000.
Thus, taking advantage of all options,
you have a maximum amount purchas-
able of £30,000, with only the one
medical examination when the initial
policy is taken out.
m
Jlllll
Even if you should delay to, say, age 35,
you still have two further option dates.
Perhaps you are thirty now; you have a
young family and a responsibility for
their future and your own. You can
take out an initial policy for any amount
up to £5,000, and increase it as you will
at the option dates, with no fear of
refusal on medical grounds.
The coverage, of course, applies to
women, too. The same complete protec-
tion applies to you as a career woman,
or a young wife sharing family responsi-
bilities.
This is worry-free security, enabling you
to plan for the future with a new
confidence.
You can have more specific details of
this Life Assurance plan by contacting
your nearest Customlife office (listed
below). If you have delayed buying life
assurance, this may be the wisest time for
you to move. Customlife will tailor a
policy to your requirements immediately.

NSW POLITICS
Selling NSW “down the
river” to Adelaide
Swing against Labor in the West
E. WETHERELL
No statement.
FROM BOB BOTTOM IN BROKEN HILL
VI/hen the NSW Labor Government
"" faces the electors later this year,
it may encounter its greatest fight in
quarters where it would least expect
opposition. For in the sprawling
electorates of Cobar and Sturt, which
always have been absolutely safe Labor
seats, discontent with the Government
is rife.
If the Government doesn’t quickly do
something about development at Menin-
dee, 70 miles east of Broken Hill, where
the £4 million Menindee Lakes Scheme
was opened more than three years ago,
it could easily lose the support of many
of its staunch supporters even in the
Labor stronghold of Broken Hill.
Despite promises by the Premier, Mr
R. Heffron, and other politicians, nothing
at all has been done to make use of the
Menindee water. In fact, the Govern-
ment has blocked any attempt to develop
primary industry in the area, while two
million acre feet of water is virtually
lying idle in the lakes.
Criticism of the Government has
snowballed in recent months and Broken
Hill's Labor daily, “Barrier Daily Truth,”
is constantly running articles and
editorials attacking the Government’s
stalling on Menindee.
The Menindee Dairymen’s Associa-
tion, a group of Broken Hill men who
want to establish a settlement of dairy
farms at Menindee, has issued a demand
to the Barrier District Assembly of the
ALP to get the two local MPs, Messrs
E. Wetherell (Cobar) and W. E. Wattison,
to come to Broken Hill to face a mass
meeting. They will be asked to explain
the lack of response by the Government
to continued pressure for something to
be done at Menindee.
One of the strangest aspects of the
Menindee affair is that neither Mr. Weth-
erell nor Mr Wattison has ever made
a public statement on the Government's
policy concerning Menindee. People here
wonder what they know.
At least one prominent person from
Broken Hill plans to stand for election
as an independent, using development
of Menindee as a platform, and should
capture a large number of Labor votes.
There was a big swing against Labor in
the Darling electorate in the recent Fed-
eral elections.
With most of the water in the Menin-
dee lakes going to South Australia and
Victoria for the next seven years under
the Murray River Agreement, people
here are accusing the Government of
“selling them down the river.” The most
widely accepted view is that the Menin-
dee storages are just a “pay off” to these
States by NSW for the Snowy Moun-
tains Scheme.
RELIGION
Suspicion, Superstition, Friendliness
Pioneer Sociology
FROM MATHEW VAUGHAN IN SYDNEY
A pioneer venture in religious
sociology, a survey of just what
Catholics and Protestants think of each
other, has gone some distance towards
proving what everyone suspects that
the Ecumenical Movement has a long
way to go. The survey was carried out
by questionnaires sent out by Father W.
G. Smith, SJ, the editor of the Jesuit-
managed “Social Survey”, which also acts
as a kind of unofficial handbook for the
National Civic Council.
Father Smith asked 330 Catholics and
100 Protestants what they thought of the
other denomination's feelings towards
them. (This was, in his own words,
“thought to be a more reliable method
than asking Catholics to give their own
attitudes towards Protestants and vice-
versa (because) few people are likely to
confess readily that they are hostile to
members of another denomination.”)
What emerged from this was that Protes-
tants thought Catholics had a much lower
opinion of them than Catholics thought
Protestants had of them; 32 per cent of
Protestants considered Catholics to be in-
different to them, 14 per cent thought
Catholics were suspicious of them and
12 per cent thought they were intoler-
ant. Another six per cent wrote into
the questionnaire the word “Superior”.
On the other side, 40.6 per cent of
Catholics considered that Protestants’
feelings towards them were friendly and
45.7 per cent indifferent. Only 12.9 per
cent of Catholics saw their Protestant
brethren as hostile and 0.8 per cent as
intolerant.
Asked what they thought of each
others' religious services, 70 per cent of
Protestants thought that Catholic services
were superstitious, while 78.6 per cent
of Catholics thought that Protestant ser-
vices were “wordy” and 37 per cent'
called them “emotional”.

On motivation, the interesting fact was
revealed that 38 per cent of Protestants
thought that Catholics practised their
religion from fear of Hell. (The same
figure for the Catholic opinion was 8.4
per cent.) However, about half of the
Catholics mostly thought that Protestants
practised from social custom. (40 per
cent of Protestants thought the same
thing of Catholics.
The Catholic school system received
a justification when in a question about
the level of the other’s religious know-
ledge 81.2 per cent of Protestants thought
that Catholics were well-informed about
Catholic doctrines; although Catholics
thought that only 8.8 per cent of Protes-
tants were well-informed.
In his conclusion, Father Smith, noting
that there was a long way to go, spoke of
“the lack of truly friendly and trusting
contact between members of the groups.”
He also spoke of the need for finding
some way to overcome the absence of
first-hand knowledge of other religious
services.
The whole survey was conducted in
a courteous (too courteous?) way, but a
most serious defect is the omission of
Anglicans possibly because so many
Anglicans refuse to be classified as
Protestant.
MIGRATION
No Spaniards
In the West
The under-paid migrants
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
HPhe closure of the Northam migrants
camp recently has been an echo of a
bungled situation which led to the sus-
pension of Spanish migration to Austra-
lia, which still has not been resumed.
The tale began about 18 months ago
when grand plans were made to step up
the dwindling European migrant intake
by bringing over skilled Spaniards. Of
these, Western Australia was to get nearly
1000.
But then early last year some of the
migrants demonstrated at their Northam
holding camp against low-paid work in
remote areas on the start of the standard
gauge railway.
About 100 men and women marched
through the township to dramatise their
pleas for more work and more pay. They
claimed they had been promised between
£l5 and £2O; they were taking home less
than £l3 a week.
Another unfortunate aspect was the
inference that an outside rabble-rouser
“the mysterious Spaniard” was behind
the demonstrations. This was quickly hit
on the head, but not before it had been
given a lot of news space.
After the demonstration the Common-
wealth began to divert some of the 1000
scheduled for Western Australia to other
States and the claim began to be current
that in asking for the Spanish migrants
Western Australia had been over-stating
its needs.
But the diversion was followed by a
suspension of the whole inter-governmen-
tal agreement for Spanish migrants.
Northam camp does not look like reopen-
ing for a while yet.
LITERATURE
New Zealand
Sex Poems
No Government subsidy
FROM RON TAYLOR IN AUCKLAND
Publisher Albion Wright, of Pegasus
Press, Christchurch, has revealed a
spark of independence all too rare in
New Zealand’s womb-to-tomb Socialist
paradise. He has told the committee of
the State Literary Fund that he will
publish, unabridged, the New Zealand
“Poetry Yearbook”, even though by doing
this he will lose the Fund’s £3OO subsidy
on the book and assure his firm of at
least one financial loss for the year.
For the committee demanded of
publisher Wright that he cut from the
book six poems all with a sexual theme
or lose the subsidy.
Argument over the “Poetry Yearbook”
started in September last year during
the absence overseas of Professor lan
A. Gordon, head of Wellington Uni-
versity’s English department and chair-
man of the Literary Fund. In former
years the “Yearbook” editor, Louis John-
son, had been left to make his own
poetry selections and the subsidy was
an automatic grant. But this- time he
was asked to produce the proof copies
for perusal by the committee.
The storm burst over three poems by
New Zealand’s leading poet, James K.
Baxter, himself a member of the State
Literary Fund committee, two written
by Christchurch journalist Richard
Packer, and the other by Wellington
actor Martyn Sanderson.
Editor Johnson and publisher Wright
are now adamant that the poems should
stay. Johnson admits that his first re-
action to the committee’s request was
to agree in order to facilitate appearance
of the book for the sake of the 30 other
contributors. But then he talked with
Wright whose view was that, as a
reputable publisher he would rather not
have his own or his editor’s rights and
responsibilities assumed by the Literary
Fund committee.
If the committee, established to help
New Zealand literature toward maturity,
continues with its attitude, writers will
be forced to try for publication over-
seas of all works, says Johnson.
In the meantime it is a matter of wait
and see what happens to sales of the
New Zealand “Poetry Yearbook” due
for printing in April. Normally sales are
only about 1500 to 2000 copies at
10s. 6d. (the price at subsidy). This year
the book will be double the cost.
But there is no telling what the
attitude of the public will be. The
Literary Fund committee’s puritanical
approach may yet produce a national
best-seller.

Timor—Sleeping Island
For Portugal—a financial drian and political embarrassment
By ROBERT RAYMOND
(Mr Raymond recently took a TV crew to Timor—the first to enter the colony—for
the National Television Network.)
IF, as the Chinese say, a journey of a
thousand miles begins with a single
step, then a visit to Timor begins
with a trip to Canberra, and an inter-
view with the Portuguese charge
d’affaires.
I was not very hopeful that we would
get permission to make a television pro-
gramme in Timor. Friends of mine in
the ABC had told me that they had been
waiting for nearly two years for visas.
Portugal has little enough to offer the
world in the way of a model colony—
but Timor was reputed to be backward
beyond belief, the people, according to
the last Australian reporter to go there,
living in constant fear of the PIDE,
or State security police.
The fact that I and my camera crew
were to be accompanied by Desmond
Mahon of 2SM, the Roman Catholic-
controlled radio station in Sydney, may
have been the deciding factor—but after
no more than two months our visas were
issued.
To get to Timor from Darwin means
flying by TAA—which thus becomes, on
this one and little-publicised route, an
overseas carrier. It appears that the
Portuguese used to fly their own plane
(the “Dili Dove”) into Darwin, until it
vanished into the Timor Sea. The De-
partment of Civil Aviation then refused
to allow the Portuguese to resume the
service with their one remaining Dove.
So now the Portuguese Government
charters a TAA Friendship every week
■—£l6 return—to make the two-hour
flight to Baucau and back, carrying mail,
Portuguese army personnel and civil ser-
vants, and occasionally someone from
Darwin who wants to buy a demijohn of
cheap (and extremely badly travelled)
wine.
This weekly flight, and a call every
couple of months by a ship that makes
the rounds of the colonies (or ‘'overseas
provinces”, as the Portuguese rather
grandly style them), is Timor’s only
contact with the outside world. The sense
of isolation and remoteness which this
situation engenders in the white popula-
tion is, I am sure, a major factor in their
outlook.
This may, however, change quite soon.
At some enormous cost (because of the
expense of importing equipment and
materials) the Portuguese have con-
structed at Baucau a genuine jet-age air
strip, longer than the one at Darwin.
They are now hoping to persuade over-
seas airlines (BOAC and KLM have
shown some interest) to make Baucau
a stopping place on the Europe-Aus-
tralia route in addition to, or per-
haps instead of, Djakarta.
But nothing of this kind will or can
happen until the Portuguese go all the
way, and spend almost as much again
on landing aids, servicing facilities, and
terminal buildings which seems un-
likely, as the strip itself cost nearly as
much as Timor’s total budget for a year.
The present airport buildings at
Baucau, roasting in the sun beside the
shimmering white runway, are single-
storied, and one has a rusting tin roof.
A few watchful Timorese stand around
in the shadows, but arriving passengers
and their luggage are mostly handled by
a group of Portuguese. They are dressed
in a casual mixture of styles, from uni-
forms to shorts and sports shirts, and
it is difficult to tell who is the boss,
because they all have a vague air of the
PIDE about them except for the pilot
of the Dove, who ferries passengers down
the coast to Dili, the capital. He has a
certain alertness of manner, which may
come from the fact that he is a former
fighter pilot, flying in Timor on contract.
He had never seen a De Havilland Dove
before he came to Timor but never-
theless hurled us off the Baucau plateau
and down the coast with efficiency.
At Dili airport—which has a swampy
grass runway, with water buffaloes graz-
ing along the edge —we waited an hour
for some form of transport to meet us.
The Governor’s car was parked near a
hangar, and at one point he came hurry-
ing past us into the terminal to telephone
his ADC to organise our transport. He
was wearing shorts; and appeared to be
a man in his early fifties, with short hair
and a brisk military air.
Behind the scenes, I gathered, a certain
tension had built up in expectation of our

arrival —the first television team ever to
visit the place. But the Governor left
without greeting us, preferring a more
formal occasion.
Eventually a man in an open-necked
white shirt took us to Dili’s only hotel.
He turned out to be the head of the local
administration, and a comparative new-
comer to Timor. He lost no time in
telling us that he wasn’t very popular with
the Government, because he talked too
much, and didn’t care what he said:
“Talking too much” apparently consists,
in Portuguese territory, of admitting that
things aren’t going too well in Angola.
The hotel consisted of a few hot, stuffy
rooms and an open-air dining area under
a tin roof. The proprietor was an age-
ing and resigned deportodo —a class of
person apparently so numerous in Timor
that they ought to form, when the idea
of adult suffrage finally reaches there, a
formidable voting bloc.
Deportados are persons deported from
the homeland for various offences, mainly
political. Timor was an obvious place
to send them, because of its isolation.
Many years ago they were confined to
a small island near Dili, but later they
were sent to the mainland. The Govern-
ment permitted them to do anything they
liked in the way of making a living, and
today some have become comparatively
prosperous. There was a heavy traffic
in them until some 15 years ago, when
the practice was called off.
Our first call on the Governor, at his
office, was short. He speaks quite good
English, and gave an impression of earn-
estness and complete involvement with
his new position—the first civil job he
has ever had. Lt Colonel Correia was,
until he came to Timor six months ago,
a career army officer, and a member of
the Portuguese General Staff.
I told him we would like to interview
him, after we had toured the country.
He was reluctant to agree, mainly, he
said, because of the inadequacy of his
English. But he asked us to come to his
residence on our return, then handed us
over to his ADC.
“We take no more chances'”
Mendoza is a character who
stands out in three dimensions from
the hazy, flat Timor scene. He is very tall,
very thin, and very elegant in his white
uniform. Like the Governor, he is a
new arrival. Until he was severely
wounded, he was fighting with the Portu-
guese army in Angola. From his chisel-
ed face a brilliant smile and icy blue
eyes look out with a mixture of amuse-
ment and watchfulness. The smile comes
and goes, but the iciness never goes from
the eyes.
“If you are not correct in what you
say about us,” he told me smilingly, “you
will be the last Australians ever to come
to Timor. This is the last time. We in-
tend to take no more chances.”
It was clear that a series of articles by
an Australian reporter, a Sydney daily
newspaper correspondent, a few months
ago had made a deeper and more wound-
ing impression in Dili than perhaps they
had in Australia.
I told Captain Mendoza that if he
wanted to avoid having, as he put it,
“lies” told about the place, then he had
better see that visiting reporters had bet-
ter treatment than the reporter had re-
ceived. (There is no transport to be hired
in Timor, and the Sydney correspondent
never got out of Dili, where he was
shunned by the previous Governor, and
ignored by everyone.)
Captain Mendoza went away to or-
ganise some transport for us to go into
the interior. After, apparently, a sur-
vey of the administration’s resources—
three Land Rovers and a collection of
largely obsolescent Japanese jeeps—he
commandeered the Chief Justice’s Land
Rover and hired a driver. “Remember,”
he said with a smile as we left, “no lies”.
The flat parts of Timor are unremark-
able, but the mountains are quite extra-
ordinary. Higher than any in Australia,
they are cut by misty, windswept valleys
with villages and huts clinging to the
slopes, for all the world like some Alpine
landscape.
The people of the interior are quiet,
shy, unobtrusive and watchful. They dig
their plots of ground with pointed sticks,
and plant the seeds in holes. (The admin-
istration told us that they had “many”
ploughs distributed round the country,
but that the people were not interested in
learning how to use them. We saw no-
body either with a plough, or being
shown how to use one.)
The roads wind through these valleys
along brilliantly surveyed contour lines,
and the grades are gentle but the
broken rock surfaces are unbelievably
bad, and the total absence of vehicles,
except for Land Rovers and jeeps, is
understandable.
The villages in the interior are vaguely
like those in any south-east Asian coun-
try full of children, chickens, goats,
and dogs, with a few Chinese stores
selling cloth, canned food, cigarettes,
shirts, and beer (from places as far away
as Mozambique and Angola). The dif-
ference is in the garrison-town atmos-
phere at all the larger centres. The
white stone Portuguese buildings and
barracks, the white churches and mis-
sions, the white soldiers wandering aim-
lessly about the streets, or drinking in
the stores these look incongruous in
the brown and green landscape.
The Portuguese first came to Timor in
the 15th century, in the great age of the
navigators. The first settlements were at
the western end, at Koepang, but in 1613
the more numerous and more active
Dutch drove the Portuguese out of west-
ern Timor into the rather less desirable
eastern end of the island. The capital was
arbitrarily set up on the narrow coastline
at Dili, and the Portuguese have regretted
it ever since, although they have lacked
the initiative to move it. Dili swelters
in shocking heat and humidity that rapid-
ly saps energy and initiative, while only
thirty or forty miles inland, up in the
mountains, places like Maubisse enjoy
a cool mountain climate that should
surely freshen up the thinking of any
administrator.
Paternalism
T'hese inland posts, or district admin-
-B_ istrative centres, were only set up in
this century after some of the tribes had
risen, in 1913, against the collection of
tributes and taxes. Now there are troops
at strategic centres, and the districts are
run by chefs de poste. These men are
civilians, but wear military-style uniforms.
Most are Portuguese, but there are one
or two Timorese-born among them, as
well as the one we had most to do with,
a Goanese Indian who transferred to
Timor eight years ago. They carry out
the system of utter paternalism which
exists throughout Timor.
The central government, through the
chefs de poste, do everything that is done
in the villages—build the roads, run the
schools and hospitals and collect the
taxes. Every fit man between 18 and 58
must pay a head tax of about £2 10s a
year. If he can't pay it—and few Timor-
ese villagers, preoccupied with feeding
their families, have any earning capacity
—he can work as a laborer to pay it off.
There are now embryo local councils
in some areas, but they are at the mercy
of the central government for funds and,
therefore, play little part in village life.
The missions carry part of the teaching
burden, but with what must be for them,
after 450 years of effort, precious little
satisfaction.
To see two priests in a tiny mountain
village like Ainaro, still there after 25
years’ labor, living in the utmost personal
austerity, without a refrigerator to keep
their food eatable, with no grants of any
kind from the Mother Church in Portu-
gal, depending on their wits to maintain
themselves and their church, still trying
to repair the church roof that was strip-
ped of its copper by the Japanese forces
20 years ago, patiently trying to convert
a basically uninterested local people to

Christianity—to see this, and to share a
meal with them, is to wonder once again
whether the incalculable amount of
human energy and dedication that has
gone into the missionary work all over
the world might not have been put to
better use in some more material field,
such as health or agriculture.
Our Goanese chef de poste, who ac-
companied us on part of our journey,
was an able, efficient and compassionate
man, with all his race’s fluency of thought
and sophistication of attitude towards the
universal struggle for existence.
“Our job here is what you might call
being the agent of civilisation,” he said,
“to help these people to learn how to
live. But all advances depend upon the
possibilities of the people to absorb new
ideas, and here that is very slow.”
When I asked him about his views, as
an Indian, of the Portuguese policies to-
wards the colored people in, say, Angola,
he showed some reluctance to discuss the
subject—but it was clear that he, like
many Portuguese in Government service,
is not happy with the policies that they
are directed by Lisbon to administer.
If there is any hostility towards the
Portuguese in Timor it is carefully con-
cealed by the Timorese. After all, there
is no one they can complain to if they
are dissatisfied - so they don’t com-
plain. (The question of complaining to
nearby Indonesian Timor has yet to
occur to many in Portuguese Timor
but the Portuguese assured us that con-
ditions were much worse across the
border, and I have no doubt that they
are right.)
During the Japanese occupation, a subt-
le attempt was made by the Japanese to
incite the Timorese against the Portu-
guese “white imperialists”. This cam-
paign, which was partially successful for
a while, apparently had two aims. The
immediate Japanese aim was to neutralise
the active help that some Timorese in the
mountains were giving to the Australian
guerrillas. The other, long-term aim was
presumably part of the general plan to
throw the European powers out of south-
east Asia generally, in which case it
would be necessary to persuade the
Timorese that yellow imperialism was
preferable to white imperialism.
The search for oil
Tn fact, the opportunity to turn against
A the Portuguese did appeal to some
Timorese, and there were a few Japan-
ese-inspired massacres of Portuguese
troops, civilians, even priests and women
and children. (The Portuguese in Timor,
it must be remembered, were supposed
to remain neutral, while the Australians
harassed the occupying Japanese for a
year. Actually, many Portuguese actively
helped the Australian campaign.)
Timor’s lack of development stems
partly from the general Portuguese policy
that overseas development of the colonies
is a needless expense, and partly from
its own economic inadequacy. It has,
unfortunately for its people, really noth-
ing that can be sold or exploited. The
land is not rich, and there is a six
months’ dry spell which hampers agri-
culture. There may be minerals there,
but nobody seems to have looked for
them. Oil there certainly is, but the
experience of those companies who have
tried searching for it is not encouraging.
The main concession at present is held
by Timor Oil, a small Australian com-
pany that has been drilling along the
south coast for six years. There is cer-
tainly oil there somewhere, because it
seeps out of the ground all over the
place and there are gas leaks that have
been burning for years. Abandoned
wells are dotted along the coast, where
the oil flow has been good, but not good
enough.
The trouble seems to be that the folded,
rocky ground requires heavier drilling
equipment than Timor Oil can get in
there, in view of the total lack of land-
ing facilities and roads. The only way to
bring anything in is by a landing craft
that makes a run from Darwin and
dumps everything on the beach, weather
permitting.
An even bigger handicap is the fact
that the Portuguese Government, desper-
ate for revenue, imposes full customs
duties on everything that Timor Oil
brings in. (In Australia oil prospecting
equipment and supplies are duty-free.)
In fact, it has got to the stage where the
economy of the territory is partly de-
pendent upon these import duties. Two
days before we called on Fred Roeberg,
the Timor Oil representative in Beaco,
he had travelled up to Baucau to pay an
accumulated customs’ account of several
thousand pounds.
“They were waiting at the airport to
rush my cheque back to Dili,” said Mr.
Roeberg. “They told me the Govern-
ment salaries couldn’t be paid until they’d
got our money.”
The budget of Timor is, on the face
of it, ludicrously inadequate less than
£1.5 million per year, for a population
of li million. Nearly a million of this
is a direct subsidy from Lisbon—which
must be hard enough to find for a
country with a budget of its own which
is only equal to that of Queensland.
(And which is severely strained anyway
by the war which Portugal insists on
waging in Angola.)
The only export is coffee, and up till
now this has all been bought, at un-
realistically low prices, by interests in
Lisbon who have managed to prevent the
growers in Timor from selling on the
world market. Last year, however, a
grower in Timor bucked the system, and
sent a consignment of his coffee to Syd-
ney, on spec. In the present wildly un-
stable market in coffee (prices have gone
up 180 per cent in the last 12 months),
it was sold instantly—and Timorese cof-
fee could become known here, for it is
excellent and still cheap.
Tourism?
In his search for ways of increasing
his budget the new Governor is dreaming
of that glittering panacea of all impover-
ished countries tourism. At first sight
the prospect of attracting tourists seems
pretty remote and so are the potential
tourists, as there is no centre of well-
heeled population within thousands of
miles of Timor. The one exception (al-
though the thought of being considered
a well-heeled centre of population would
arouse derisive laughter there) is Darwin.
But to Captain Mendoza, who is the un-
likely choice of the Governor to conduct
the tourist trade, the people of Darwin
are eminently desirable tourists.
“I will run cheap week-end flights,”
he told me enthusiastically. “I know how
much it costs them to fly to Sydney or
Melbourne on leave. They will be able to
come over here once a month for what
it costs them now to go south once a
year.”
He carefully copied down what I could
remember of the duty-free goods that
Australian customs permit travellers to
bring back with them, and said he was
already thinking of establishing a duty-
free store at Baucau, and perhaps even
a casino.
“Our big problem is the hotel at
Baucau,” he said. “We can’t find anyone
to run it.”
Baucau itself could become a pleasant
weekend resort for anyone from Darwin,
for about <£2o fares and accommodation
all in. It is on a plateau above the sea,
and pleasantly cool. There is an excellent
swimming pool in the town (built by
Timor Oil as a goodwill gesture in the
early days) and enough local color to be
interesting.
Few tourists are likely to get as far
as Dili, which is just as well, because
the atmosphere there is oppressive
and not just climatically. There is an air
of militarism which we found depressing.
Troops wander about the streets, and
every conversation includes some refer-
ence to the PIDE.

with the local chief of the PIDE, with-
out learning anything about him. Per-
haps he wanted to find out what we were
after. He was pleasant enough, and com-
plained that although his establishment in
Dili was 34, he was forced to operate
with himself, four men, and a girl.
But understaffed or not, the name of
~ „.„ i- . . . ’ .
the PIDE, with its powers of arrest and
detention without trial, is mud in Dili (as
it is, one gathers, in Portugal). Even the
- „ , . ~
Governor, when we finally went to the
. . ■ . . • , ,
resiaencici to interview him, showed some
. , . ~ n(nv c u r-f *
resentment at the PIDE s ability to go
over his head with reports to Lisbon
about anything it felt threatened the
security of State. (The captain of
the frigate in the harbor—the only Portu-
guese warship in the east—reputedly re-
fused to let the PIDE aboard to inspect
and interrogate his crew.)
The Governor himself struck me as a
sincere and able man, with a genuine
desire to get things moving in Timor. In
his halting but thoughtful English he
admitted that things hadn’t progressed as
fast as they might, but blamed the lack
of money for it. and would admit no
shortcomings in attitudes.
“The world is against Portugal and our
policies,” he saidT “But we think the
world is quite wrong. We think our way
j s the right one.”
He said he hadn . t heard tha , hjs

A ve hospitals and 20 doctors (including
one surgeon) for 14 million people, and
only one high school, less than three
years old but said that Portugal s
enemies were draining away the money
* n other parts of the world,
With Captain Mendoza hovering anxi-
ously in the background, he finally dis-
cussed the big question mark hanging
over Portuguese Timor—the intentions of
Indonesia.
“You can find out how many troops
we have here,” he said, “It is not so
many.” (In fact, about three battalions.)
And he went on to insist that Soekarno
and Salazar were on the best of terms,
and that there were no fears on his part
of a takeover bid. He said he didn’t pay
much attention to the noises made by
so-called Timorese underground leaders
in Djakarta, calling for liberation of their
homeland.
“We can live in peace side by side
with the Indonesians,” he concluded
bravely.
But the question remains whether the
Portuguese can continue to live, as they
have done for centuries, on top of the
Timorese people. Portugal must really
be wondering what to do with, or about,
Timor. It is a financial drain, a political
embarrassment, and a possession of in-
creasingly doubtful value. To leave it
would be humiliating, to stay might prove
even more painful, if a kind of Angola-
style situation developed, with raids
across the border harassing the scattered
administration in the mountains.
Australia is not likely to do much to
help the Portuguese solve their problem.
After all, its occupancy by the Indo-
nesians would not present much change
in the strategic picture, as there are al-
ready much better air and naval instal-
lations at Koepang, in Indonesian Timor.
While being unable to resist some sym-
pathy for the Portuguese in Timor, who
haven’t a friend in the place—or in the
world, for that matter —one must also
conclude that the problems are wholly
of Portugal’s own making. They have
had 450 years to work out a solution,
and it looks as if there is little time left.
For anyone who can say, as Captain
Mendoza did as we left, that “we are
winning in Angola,” time must indeed be
standing still.

5. Conversation with a
707 Jet Pilot
“Afterwards ... you feel like a piece of chewed up string ..."
By PETER HASTINGS
Now that the grand old days when
fliers were really fliers are gone, how does
it feel to be nothing more than a highly
qualified chauffeur?
The grand old days as you call them
have certainly gone. You’re wrong about
pilots being chauffeurs though. A captain
of a Qantas 707 jet is responsible for a
£24-m. machine, weighing 258,000 lbs
fully loaded, carrying 100 passengers
at 40,000 feet or thereabouts at nine-
tenths of the speed of sound —that's
scarcely being a chauffeur.
Most of you senior pilots have had a
lot of experience?
Ninety per cent of us, mostly bomber
pilots, graduated from the RAAF.
Qantas senior pilots are lousy with
DFCs and you see quite a few DSOs
as well.
Where else do you get pilots from?
Qantas won’t take them until they are
fully licensed in every respect. It’s very
expensive. It costs a young man £lO,OOO
to become a pilot of the standard re-
quired by Qantas of its probationary ap-
pointees. It then costs Qantas about
£23,000 to train a pilot right through to
the Boeing 707 stage.
What have you flown for Qantas?
DC 3s, DC 4s, DC 6s, Constellations,
Electras and now, of course, the 7075.
Was it hard to convert?
It wasn’t easy. It involved an intense
three months ground technical course,
many hours in the simulator and of
course many hours on the 707 s them-
selves. It's a magnificent piece of mach-
inery, incidentally, but technically very
complicated. That’s why major inter-
national airlines are now looking for
young pilot trainees with their engineer-
ing or science degrees. That alone puts
paid to the idea of jet pilots being
chauffeurs.
To digress for a second. You say
the Boeing is a magnificent piece of
machinery. What about the Comet?
A beautiful aircraft—manoeuvrable,
handles easily and so on but it was design-
ed for midgets rather than passengers.
Do you have to keep up-to-date on
the Boeing?
Very much so. It's being modified all
the time and all Qantas pilots have to do
two refresher courses a year at Avalon
in Victoria and two route courses with a
senior check captain. Then, of course,
we have to put in a minimum of five
hours on the simulator at Sydney—4s
while in traiping. The simulator, which
simulates every conceivable air-borne
situation from obscure fires to two-
engined landings, can be just as exhaust-
ing as flying, by the way. Sometimes
more so.
Is the difference between prop and
Jet engined aircraft very great?
It’s quite radically different. The jet
is a swept-wing aircraft for a start. You
land nose up and not nose down as in,
say, a Connie, and at 165-170 mph
rather than 115-120 mph. Those are big-
ger differences than they sound. Landing,
taking off, flying procedures and the
intricate nature of the machine itself are
all different. So is the responsibility and
concentration required of a captain.
But you have a large air crew, haven’t
you?
The 707 carries three pilots—one of
whom is a Grade 1 or II Captain—and
engineer and navigator. The pilots must
be able to do any of the other jobs in
case of emergency. That’s an adequate
air crew.
Then you’re not too badly off?
It’s not a question of being well or
badly off. It's the strain of concentration
and responsibility on a jet captain that
begins to tell. Quite apart from pre and
post flight procedures, landing and taking
off at high speeds and all the rest of it,
just consider what I have to do in, say,
a 10-hour flight covering 4000 miles
or more. On my side of the flight deck
I continuously monitor and I mean
continuously two artificial horizons,
one air speed indicator, one mach speed
indicator which shows how close we are
to the sound barrier, one altimeter, one
turn and bank indicator, one master
direction compass, one standby magne-
tic compass, a three-axis-trim indicator —
they monitor the automatic pilot signals
four engine pressure gauges, four
stage one and four stage two turbine
gauges, four exhaust gas temperature
gauges, four fuel flow indicators, four
fuel totalisator gauges, one radio mag-
netic indicator, one radar set, shared,
one vertical speed indicator.
Continuously?
Continuously. My co-pilot monitors
a duplicate set of gauges but I’m re-
sponsible. In addition every few minutes
I scan the engineer’s panel and other
instrument panels. There are about 90
instruments, clocks and gauges in
addition to hundreds of switches and
circuit - breakers with which I have to
be intimately familiar right down to the
“NO SMOKING. FASTEN SAFETY
BELTS” switch.
Have you made mistakes?
Frankly, yes. But, brother, you learn
fast where you’re responsible not only
for your own life but for that of 100
passengers aft.
What sort of mistakes?
Mostly small ones I'm glad to say. But
the point about that is that small ones
compound into bigger ones with decreas-
ing chances of correction if you're not
careful. Recently on a trip to North
America I had a young Second Officer in

training who sat behind me in tandem.
One of his duties after take off, as well
as before, is to go through this manual
here, the “Check Off List and Emergency
Procedures”, and read them off. You see
all these things that we have to check
off? Pre-Departure Check, 43 items; Pre-
Start Check, 21 items; Taxi Check, 12
items; Climb Check, 13 items and so on?
No. 13 in the Climb Check is the wind-
shield heater. The Boeing windscreens
are double thickness, slanted and elec-
trically heated. If the windows are warm
in flight they are supposed to keep birds
away, although it's unproven, but more
importantly they don’t ice-up at high
altitudes, crack with sudden changes in
temperature or fog-up on descent. We
have a switch with three positions, low,
off and high. We start in low and turn
to high when we re well aloft. I called the
check and the Second Officer moved
the switch, but, being unfamiliar with it,
moved it to off. I checked the position
visually and accepted it as being on low,
where it should be. I did a visual check
again a while later and it still didn’t
seem wrong. Quite a bit later I went and
talked to the passengers and on return-
ing to the Flight Deck went through my
scanning procedure and noticed what I
should have noticed long before the
damned thing was off. I felt the wind-
screen. Cold. I couldn’t turn the heater
on as it might have cracked the glass at .
that stage.
What did you do?
I put on an oxygen mask just in case
we ran into a storm and the window
blew out. A remote possibility but I had
to take it into consideration. My co-
pilot had to bring the plane in at the next
port as I couldn’t take the risk of my
window fogging up. But I learnt some-
thing and so did the officer I was train-
ing—check even more carefully in future.
What about other problems?
It’s hard to know where to start or
how to make you understand. But I’ll
take a few things at random. Airports,
for instance, are all different from one
another, different in length, visibility,
approach paths, in characteristics.
You have to know them and be
ready for them. In the US air traffic
congestion is now fantastic. You can
rely implicitly on ground instrumenta-
tion but who the hell likes being stacked
up with half a dozen other Boeings over
New York or San Francisco in bad
weather waiting for permission to land?
Ground Control is excellent but it can
make mistakes. Take Djakarta. Ground
Control is hopeless. Indonesian Air
Force planes are completely independent
of civil aviation control at Kemajoran
Airport and there have been some
dangerous near misses by MIGs, Ilyu-
shins and Badgers recently. There’s now
a Qantas order out for all air crew to
maintain maximum vigilance on approach
to Djakarta. Take Bombay. There’s a
1400 ft mountain smack in the middle
of the approach way. Indian ground in-
strumentation is inefficient and out of
date so we are never happy coming into
Bombay in bad weather with poor visi-
bility. And don’t forget we’re travelling
very fast these days. Take the flight
path southbound from Singapore out
over the Rhio Archipelago. The Indo-
nesians allow us a very small air corridor
to travel in. You’ve got to be very care-
ful to stay inside it because there might
be dangers in straying outside it.
Any particular landing and takeoff
problems?
Big ones. On every runway there is
a Commit Point, a moment in time and
a position in space, where you make the
big decision whether to continue taking
off or stop the machine within the run-
way confines. Above that critical speed
you must take off as you can’t safely stop.
Speed, weight, machine performance
must match at that point which is cal-
culated taking into account runway
temperature and other factors as well.
You have to make that calculation for
each take off and each runway. A
similar decision has to be made for each
landing—whether to continue to land
or to overshoot and get out. The deci-
sions must be right. A US encephalo-
gram test carried out on a pilot during
a 10-minute approach and landing show-
ed that he made 600 major decisions in
that period.
Any particular problems with speed?
Yes. If you saw a Boeing heading for
you between five and ten seconds away
a collision would be inevitable. If you
saw a Boeing heading for you 10 miles
away which is quite a distance you
would have only 30 seconds in which
to make a vital decision as to which way
you would turn. That’s one reason why
we prefer day flying, I think. One night
a year or so ago I was over the Middle
West of America at 39,000 feet, in the
right corridor at the right altitude, when
Ground Control told me to turn sharply
to port to avoid five military jets on
manoeuvres. I turned to port and went
right through the lot of them. Ground
Control had meant to say starboard.
This is rare, but it happens.
Did the incident shake you?
For a few minutes.
What’s your greatest worry in the air?
Fire is one. But the procedures for
handling that are good and there’s less
risk in the jets than in the old prop
planes. Jet kerosene is less volatile than
gasoline; jet engines have fewer compo-
nent parts than prop engines and so on.
But it’s on my mind all the time.
What’s your other worry?
Weather. Even at 40,000 feet you can
run into enormous storms which in the
building up stages don’t show up on
radar. The other week over the Indian
Ocean a young colleague ran around two
big storms to run smack into a third, a
cracker. We now believe that the Boeing
which blew up in the US last December
was struck by lightning. It’s not proved
but it’s a reasonable assumption. We now
have a Qantas directive and a Boeing
recommendation to avoid storms as much
as possible.
Are they hard to avoid?
The trouble is you come up on them
pretty fast. Not long ago a friend of
mine saw some enormous cumulus 50
miles ahead of him but decided with his
co-pilot that it wasn't too bad. They
climbed up on it fast and, too late, saw it
was a very bad one. It let out a bolt
of lightning that struck the jet on the
nose, burnt off all the lightning arrestors,
completely froze the magnetic compass,
created a fireball which went off like a
cannon and shot down the whole length
of the cabin, knocking a steward up and
down the aisle like a paper bag, tore
holes in the wings of the plane and blind-
ed the pilot for quite a few minutes, not
to mention shocking the passengers. How-
ever, that’s an extreme example which
I quote with others as an indication of
what jet captains expect and sometimes
get and the degree of concentration and
effort required of them all the time.
Are you glad to get down?
No, you’re too tired to be glad. You’re
like a bit of chewed up string and usually
good for nothing. Jet pilot fatigue is a
very real thing, much more intense than
that experienced by prop engine pilots,
and it's the result, I think, not merely
of the natural anxiety we all feel in com-
manding a huge ship with a hundred
passengers in our care, but of the sheer
strain of concentration. As you know
we have a direct flight from Honolulu to
Brisbane, Brisbane to Honolulu —a dis-
tance of 4600 miles in nine hours. When
I land at Brisbane I feel as if I have
been strapped in a long metal tube for
about four months. I want to get out
badly.
What about broken hours and sleep?
They're a big problem to us. You land
somewhere early in the morning after an
all-night flight and you’re supposed to
get some sleep but it’s almost impossible.

You know what made the gramophone of 1905 just a squeaky noise today?
One thing, competition!
The manufacturer who does not improve his product or service to the public
to keep ahead of his competitors, fails. Competition is the driving force that is
the spur to progress.
In Australia there are many banks, each in competition for your business, with the
result that Australia has a banking service equal to the best in the world.
Every Australian benefits from Competition between Banks

And you have to be ready to take off
again that night. Time Zones can become
very wearing. You hardly know whether
it’s night or day. Your whole body
metabolism gets out of whack.
How do wives feel about it?
I don't know one who likes her hus-
band being a pilot on an international
jet line. He's away for long periods when
she has all the worries of bringing up a
family, facing domestic crises and mak-
ing the decisions. He is usually tired and
irritable when he gets home and some
of us are finding it increasingly hard to
unwind, even to sleep. One of the simu-
lator instructors in Sydney says even he
finds the same thing a high degree
of concentration over long periods and
he finds it very hard to relax.
What days off do you get?
Well, after an 11-day tour of duty
abroad involving a great deal of flying I
am currently entitled to four and two-
fifths days off. But it doesn't work out
that way in actual fact. Day One, on
return, I sleep. Day Two, supposedly a
rest day, I invariably end up with the
Flight Engineer talking to someone at
Qantas about something that happened
on the flight and something always has
happened. Day Three I actually get
around to seeing the family. On Day
Four I might play golf. Day Five is a
duty day. Day Six is standby day and
Day Seven we’re off again.
Standby?
You can’t move from the telephone in
case you have to take someone's place
and fly out. In fact at any time except
on annual leave you can't move out of a
50-mile radius of home base. If, on my
days off, I wanted to spend 24 hours
away from home I would have to get
company permission. To go fishing on
the Hawkesbury out of telephone reach
is out of the question.
What about financial rewards?
It’s difficult to say. Qantas salary
scales, like those of other jet lines, are
necessarily very complicated by gradings,
jobs, dates of appointment and so on. I
suppose that there are about 12 or so
Grade I Captains in Qantas at the
top of the salary scale. I earn the top
salary of about £6400 a year. This in-
cludes base pay, living away expenses,
aircraft type loading and so on. But I
was appointed a Grade I Captain pretty
early in the piece. Competition is much
keener now and salaries drop commen-
surately down the line. The best First
Officer in the whole 300 or so pilots
with Qantas won’t necessarily become a
Grade I Captain, which is a selective
rank. There’s luck in it, too.
When could a promising young pilot
hope to reach your rank and salary?
Getting all the breaks, I’d say it would
take him at least 14 years. Don’t forget
that in each grade there’s seven years of
service to be completed.

SOUTH AFRICA
“Side-tripping” to South Africa, on your way to (or
from) Europe/U.K., is a very logical thing to do. Firstly,
it enables you to investigate personally today’s excel-
lent export opportunities in South Africa and her
northern neighbours. Secondly, it offers wondrous
sight-seeing opportunities (such as Kruger National
Park) —a welcome break from the beaten tracks of
traditional routes. And finally, it costs as little as
£15.10.0* in extra air fares, including S.A.A.’s Boeing
Stratojet service between London and Jo’burg.

What happens to pilots at retiring age?
I’ve often wondered. We are retired
at 50 with a lump sum pension together
with a slice of the Provident Fund which
in my case will amount to about £25,000.
It sounds good but at 50 we are still
young with families, houses to pay off
and so on and untrained for anything
but flying. It’s a funny thing how old
pilots take up things like newsagencies,
milk runs, real estate and small grocery
stores. At least they talk about doing
that. Very few of the pilots end up in
company administration, incidentally.
We’ve talked a lot of your command
responsibilities but what about your social
duties?
The two are inextricable. As captain
of the aircraft, I meet any VIPs on my
craft before we take off. They range
from celebrities to Cabinet Ministers, by
the way. I have to be extremely discreet.
Flying brings out an underlying insecurity
in people and it makes them talk. And
the person they frequently most want to
talk to is the captain. I get confidential
business information, stock market tips,
political confidences and even occasional
VIP life histories. This happens to us
all. On the North American route I am
always out of pocket. Passengers will
invite you for a drink at Honolulu or you
simply have to repay hospitality in San
Francisco to someone. My $l2 a day
allowance doesn’t get me very far in
that respect. I'm not complaining, by
the way, merely observing.
What are passengers like on the whole?
Very pleasant. I’ve made many friends
among them. But there is always the
dissatisfied passenger.
Do you ever have trouble with them?
More often than you’d think. There’s
the passenger who makes one pass too
many at a hostess or at a female
passenger. There’s the passenger who
drinks far too much, unaware that the
oxygen content is lower than normal.
There’s the occasional VIP whose arro-
gance and rudeness are beyond belief.
What do you do?
Very tricky decision. When a steward
complains of a drunken passenger I
quietly survey the scene and I may close
the bar to him or merely tell the steward
to serve him colored water or tonic
without gin —at no charge —on the
basis he won’t know the difference. For
passengers in the other two categories
I may warn them or threaten, firmly but
politely, to off-load them at the next
port. You have to be pretty careful
though. It's a serious matter to off-load
someone.
What about dangerous passengers?
Pretty rare, although we carry hand-
cuffs and batons just in case. One cap-
tain I know copped a psychiatric case. I
won’t say where or who. The passenger
was pretty quiet for half the trip and then
suddenly seized a ham knife from the
galley and went careering down the cabin
while they were serving a seven-course
dinner. He was a big, powerful man and
it took five aircrew to overpower him be-
fore the captain could get his hands be-
hind his back and handcuff him. He sat
out the rest of the trip handcuffed in the
crew rest area with two attendants.
Do you prefer stewards or hostesses?
They both have a job to perform, al-
though I wonder whether the Australian
tradition lends itself to the steward, who
finds the work a bit menial. However,
I’ve known some wonderful stewards in
my time.
Is there a strong family feeling among
air and cabin crews?
' Strictly duration of the voyage only.
But the crew loyalty and co-operation
given a skipper always amazes me.
All, including the stewards and hostess-
es, do everything they can to make
a skipper’s job easier. Of course, you
live with them and eat with them, share
jokes and confidences and emergencies,
if any. And then Mascot—and it’s all
over as every man races through Customs
to get home. You might not team up
again for months, perhaps never. Those
collective loyalties go on though, trans-
ferred to another skipper and another
flight.

A COMPREHENSIVE SERIES
OF 24 IN-SERVICE
TRAINING UNITS
Designed to give experienced as well ag
inexperienced teachers the background and
confidence necessary to teach modern Mathe-
matics. These units are organised around
five basic mathematical themes:—
What’s My Rule? Cross Number Puzzles
Problem Solving Introduction to Sets
Numbers Have Many Names
Published in work-text form, they permit teachers to work directly in the
materials; developing a gradual understanding of the patterns of Mathe-
matics; and equally significant, to make genuine “discoveries” about these
patterns.
As teacher experience and confidence deepens, these experiences are
extended into the classroom as strong, visual supplements to any traditional
or other Mathematics programme which your school may now be using.
They do not conflict in any way—rather, these units are designed to
heighten student interest in mastery of the basic facts through new, exciting
approaches to the teaching of Mathematics. These units not only make
teacher-pupil learning fun, they are pedagogically sound.
These teacher orientated in-service training units are fulfilling the need to
upgrade the elementary Maths curriculum and training of teachers, wherever
administrators and teachers recognise the real urgency of such needs.
A limited number of copies are now available for appraisal. Price: 57/6 per copy.

Wrong Book,
Wrong Court
The condemnation of “Fanny”
By ROY JENKINS, M.P.
{Chief sponsor of reformed UK
Obscene Publications Act.)
The legal authorities of England can
be relied upon to mishandle any
issue touching the censorship of
books. Unfortunately this record of in-
eptitude does not make them fight shy
of the subject. The Director of Public
Prosecutions, aided by that indefatigable
scourge of the impure, Mr Griffith-
Jones, is usually willing to have a go.
Sometimes, as in the “Fanny Hill”
case, he seems to be successful. Yet in
fact there has rarely been a trial the result
of which, thanks entirely to the methods
of procedure chosen by the prosecuting
authorities, is less satisfactory from any
point of view. The book has been con-
demned. The learned magistrate took
only two minutes to dispose of three and
a half days of evidence and pronounce
with “no hesitation” in favor of for-
feiture. But he was able to pronounce
upon the fate of only 171- copies of the
paper-back edition in one bookshop.
Other, more expensive, editions remain
for the moment inviolate. Even the
paper-back edition might be safe if sold
in a different type of shop within the
jurisdiction of a different magistrate’s
court. Those who believed “Fanny Hill”
to be a vicious and dangerous book can
hardly be happy with such an indeter-
minate result.
Those who thought the time had
come for a new authoritative interpreta-
tion of the law on the subject are left
equally unsatisfied. The jejune words of
the magistrate are useless as a guide to
other publishers. They give no idea of

the ground on which he reached his
decision.
Was he influenced by the nature of
the shop from which the book was
seized, an issue to which the prosecution
devoted most of their evidence and much
of their argument? What did he make
of the literary evidence? Was he as un-
impressed as his remarks to the Pro-
fessor of English at Norwich (“stand
up straight and put those notes away”)
seem to indicate? Or did he think it
convincing in itself but insufficient to
outweigh the inherent obscenity of the
book? We do not know.
The circumstances in which the case
was conducted were most unfavorable
for the deployment of the “literary
merit” defence. The court-room was
cramped, with little room for Press or
public. The atmosphere was suited to
the rapid dispensation of routine criminal
justice, but not to the presentation of
subtle and erudite evidence. And the
long adjournments (from a Monday to
the next Monday to the Saturday after-
noon to the Monday week) made it
particularly difficult both to organise
witnesses and to build up a cumulative
impression.
More important still was the absence
of a jury and the fact that, on a subject
more conducive to prejudice than most,
judgment had to be given by one man,
and one man alone.
“Disclaimer” hope dashed
A ll of these objections could have been
avoided by a simple decision on
the part of the Director of Public Pro-
secutions—or of the Attorney-General.
They could —and should —have decided
to prosecute under Section Two of the
Obscene Publications Act rather than to
apply for forfeiture under Section Three.
This would have brought the issue
before a judge and jury at the Old
Bailey. It would have allowed for a
continuous trial in surroundings suited
to hearings of high public interest. It
would have caused the judge to rule
on the law and the jury to pronounce
upon the book as a book, and not merely
on the 171 copies found in a particular
shop. The result might have gone one
way or the other, but it would have
been far more generally acceptable.
Why did the Director of Public Pro-
secutions reject this course? The history
of the matter makes it difficult to avoid
the conclusion that, bearing in mind the
“Chatterley” verdict, he was anxious to
avoid again putting the issue of literary
censorship before a jury.
The “Fanny Hill” copies were seized
at the beginning of November. For six
weeks after this no action was taken.
No doubt the authorities were hoping
that, as is the practice with routine
pornography, the bookseller would sign
a “disclaimer,” and that would be the
end of the matter, without even police-
court proceedings.
But no disclaimer was forthcoming.
And it became clear that the publishers
were prepared to defend the case with
the utmost vigor and that they would
have no difficulty in assembling an im-
pressive list of expert witnesses. No one
could have read the newspapers during
these weeks without realising that the
biggest literary cause celebre since “Lady
Chatterley” was on hand. Still the DPP
made no move to follow up the seizure
until a question appeared on the order
paper of the House of Commons. Then
he announced that the Section Three
forfeiture procedure was to be used.
Through the Solicitor-General this
course was defended on three grounds:
first, that it was more usual; second,
that it was less “oppressive” to the
publishers, who had behaved responsibly
about distribution when warned of a
possible prosecution; and, third, that it
was made “appropriate” by a recent
Court of Criminal Appeal decision about
the “incorruptibility” of police officers.
This last point had nothing to do with
the financial probity of the constabulary.
It related only to a judgment that sale
to a policeman, as in the “Lady Chatter-
ley” case, could no longer be taken as
evidence of the corrupting distribution
of the book.
None of the three points had validity.
The fact that a procedure is usual in
the case of packets of dirty postcards
hardly made it appropriate when, for
the first time in three years, the defence
of literary merit was to be applied. To
suggest that it did was to run directly
counter to the intention of the Act of
1959.
The argument that the publishers had
earned less “oppressive” treatment by
their responsible behavior was to stand
justice on its head. Lest there should
be any doubt about the ludicrous nature
of this “concession” their solicitors wrote
to the DPP on December 18, pointing
out that they wished to take full re-
sponsibility for publication and would
welcome a criminal trial and the verdict
of a jury. The Director replied with a
bland but evasive repetition of the
“oppression” point. He proceeded on
the forfeiture course.
Unsatisfactory, inconclusive
As an inevitable result there followed
an unsatisfactory trial, in an inappro-
priate court, with an inconclusive verdict.
Nor could these mistakes have been
put right by an appeal. If the publishers
had incurred the expense of this course
they would merely have got a retrial
(with all the inconvenience this would
involve for their expert witnesses) before
the London Sessions with a legally
qualified chairman supported by a few
lay assistants. A jury trial would still
have been outside their reach. The ver-
dict would still have been limited in its
application.
What is the correct procedure for the
future? First, the Attorney-General
should announce that whenever the de-
fence of literary merit is to be raised he
will allow a trial by judge and jury.
Second, the police and the legal autho-
rities would be much better advised to
devote their energies to dealing with pub-
lications where no possible question of
literary merit arises. (ofns)

Year of
the
Olympiad
Disappointments in Tokyo?
By DISCUS
Athletics records have been broken
with deceptive ease during the past
two weeks, and more will go in the
three weeks to the Australian champion-
ships in Melbourne. We will seem to
have a squad of world-beaters, all
worthy of Olympic selection. Then as
the Northern Hemisphere summer be-
gins so will the disillusionment.
It’s the year of the Olympiad and
everyone runs faster, jumps better and
throws further to make the squad. That
happens all over the world, including
countries whose records are not noticed
until track-time. This year the new
African countries may surprise in ath-
letics.
I'll be surprised if any of our athletes
wins any kind of medal, and that takes
in Ron Clarke, Tony Sneazwell, lan
Tomlinson, and Dixie Willis. Naturally
I hope to be wrong. May the estimated
athletics squad of 26 all come home
winners, earning their £14,000 trip.
But why pick on athletes? The boxers
and wrestlers, cyclists and fencers,
weightlifters and gymnasts all have poor
chances of gaining, even in experience,
from their £27,000 visit to the mystic
East. Despite some brave talk, anyone
at the top in anything will be going,
and the Australian Olympic Federation’s
guess at about 100 in Australia’s team
is only about 100 per cent wrong.

piad, and spend the money trying to
grab the spotlight from the sports which
are all machines and speed, and attract
the young?
In most capitals now, the Showground
speedcars outdraw cricket, and inter-
national GP drivers draw 30,000 people
and up, while 5000 attended a recent
weekend track and field meet featuring
some of Australia’s best athletes. Bring
in a dozen of the world’s top athletes,
stage big and well-publicised carnivals,
and with a little weather luck we could
have an athletics meet with 50,000 pre-
sent.
Heaven knows, the individual sports
competitors have it hard enough. In
Sydney we’ve been treated to a comedy
in which the Government offered a few
acres of Centennial Park to the ath-
letes for an oval, public protests fol-
lowed, and the park is to be left to its
normal users cyclists, equestrians,
cricketers, footballers, model plane fly-
ers and boomerang - throwers. The
athletes are to be given a ground at
Narrabeen, about 20 miles from where
most of Sydney lives.

The world welterweight champion,
Emile Griffiths, will fight in Australia
again soon, if Stadiums Ltd can find a
suitable rundown middleweight for him,
such as Tuna Scanlon of New Zealand.
We can presume that Stadiums will be
looking for some durable cove with more
strength and courage than boxing ability;
someone who can stand up long enough
for us to see what Griffiths can do.
Some of us were satisfied with what
we saw this month at Sydney Stadium,
when Emile met Ralph Dupas. Griffiths
is one of the great Negro boxers, a mid-
dleweight above the waist, a lightweight
below, a hard welter for anyone to
meet. Like Sugar Ray Robinson in his
prime, he is so good that he has to keep
on losing and regaining his title to stay
in business, with occasional easier fights
to pad out.
Dupas was one of the easier fights.
He was in the world welter ratings, but
before he met Sandro Mazzinghi in Syd-
ney for what was described as the world
“junior” middleweight title, Gary Cow-
burn had gone 12 rounds with him in
Brisbane. That alone was a pointer to
the end of Dupas’ fighting days.
The Mazzinghi fight was much harder.
The Italian middleweight is a give and


Mr. Hiller and his craft
The Importance of a Name. It’s important to realise that there
is such a person as Mr. Ernest Hiller the label that goes on to
his suits is not a “brand name” but his own personal signature.
It’s a guarantee that the suit has been tailored to Mr. Hiller’s
demanding standards (hand detailed where only hand work
will do); that the materials are of a superb quality.
The international styling of an Ernest Hiller suit is
undisputed as is the value-for-money that goes with
every suit that carries his name. From £25.19.6.

take fighter, and he took Dupas. And
when Dupas entered the ring for his
third fight in as many months, against a
boxer of Griffiths’ class, he was commit-
ting one of those crimes against his
own person which are the really sad
things in boxing.
Griffiths went to work on him with a
complete armory of punches, and clip-
ped him with a delayed uppercut in the
second round. From then on it was
pathetic. Griffiths was afraid to hit him
hard again, and Vic Patrick was afraid
that he might, but Dupas came up and
stayed up, and the fight had to go on.
It ended, mercifully, in round three.
So we saw enough of Griffiths not
to want to see him again, unless it is
against a fighter of his own class. That
does not include Mick Leahy of England
or Tuna Scanlon, middle-class middle-
weights. And as our own retired welter
champion Sid Prior was ringside for the
Griffiths-Dupas fight it is unlikely to
include him. He could probably take
Mazzinghi with one hand, but Griffiths,
never.
The fight crowd is a strange animal
with a well-developed sense for bad
fights. It stayed away when Stadiums
charged £lO and down for the Maz-
zinghi-Dupas stoush. It was not wildly
enthusiastic about the Griffiths-Dupas
match but came to see a world champion.
What it saw was the saddest procession
of four and six round preliminaries in
living memory, and three rounds of the
main event.
It will take a really classy match to
make it forget the sour taste of that
night. And a Gattellari-Males fight is
not the one to do it. The “Rock”
against any of the first five rated fly-
weights would fill the Stadium. Then
there’s that featherweight What’s His
Name, the one who is the only world-
rated fighter we have but is being allowed
to grow old gracefully. That’s right

The traditional cloud, no bigger than
a man’s hand, has appeared on cricket’s
horizon. In Perth they've switched
baseball to summer, in Adelaide they’re
talking about it. It is quite possible
that baseball could become Australia’s
big summer game within a few years,
with visits from American, Japanese
and South African teams. The problem
of grounds is not insuperable. Televi-
sion and other proprietary interests
could work the miracle, although neither
are exactly what the Baseball Leagues
have in mind.
Baseball would not have much to beat
except summer soccer. Cricket’s de-
cline has been most evident in a season
with the greatest aggregate of batting
scores in about 35 years, matches with
plenty of excitement to them at times,
in fact just about everything except
crowds of spectators. First-rate Shield
matches drew 1000 to 6000, Test
matches generally failed to top 25,000
on any day.
The real testing day of the Tests, the
Saturday of the Fifth Test in Sydney,
was unfortunately inconclusive. The
weather was bad, the crowd was less
than 22,000. In fine weather it might
have been higher. On a comparable
day during the last England tour there
were 50,000 at the Sydney Cricket
Ground. And most of those people would
have forsworn cricket for ever, it was so
dull.
So was the end of the drawn Fifth
Test this year. Australia had the chance
to win if willing to take the risk of
losing. We played for a draw and sent
10,000 spectators home convinced that
cricket was for old gentlemen who
could remember McCabe and Bradman,
It was another great exhibition of
“we’d rather lose the spectators than
lose a Test”. The match and the series
could so easily have ended as one Shield
match in Brisbane did, when Victoria
scored an “impossible” 235 runs in 115
minutes to win. And who thought it
wa s impossible? That personification
of the Tests mentality, “Slasher” Mac-
kay.
For nearly 100 years the blokes on
the Hill have been giving cricket the
only good advice it needs—have a go.
It has been ignored. Soon it may be just
an epitaph.

MORALE IN THE RAAF
Sir,
We would like to bring to your atten-
tion the fact that the decline in the
morale of Service officers is not confined
to the Army alone, but also applies to
the RAAF. The decline in RAAF officer
morale stems from reasons similar to
those mentioned in “Army Morale”
(Bulletin, 15/2/64) and the letter sign-
ed “Army Officer” (8/2/64), and is
aggravated by the Air Board’s policy of
paying a professional allowance to some
—doctors, dentists and aircrew—whilst
declining to pay any such allowance to
members of other professions—account-
ing, education, engineering, law and
science.
One of us is a science graduate who
is paid so poorly that on the present
RAAF rates of pay it will take him until
1974 to reach the same salary range he
would enjoy today were he a civilian in
the Commonwealth Public Service. An-
other is an engineer earning approxi-
mately £3OO per annum less than award
rates, and £3OO p.a. less than he would
receive today were he a civilian employed
by Department of Air! This latter case
is a direct result of Air Board’s disregard
of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court’s
1961 determination of professional engin-
eers’ salaries. The third is a qualified
accountant earning approximately £4OO
per annum less than his civilian contem-
poraries.
As RAAF officers we accept the hard-
ships encountered in the course of our
duties. However, Air Board apparently
interprets our acceptance of the inherent
hardships of Service life as an excuse for
loading us with additional hardships of
Air Board’s own creation—poor rates of
pay, poor housing and exorbitant compul-
sory contributions to the superannuation
fund.
For almost three years we have waited
patiently for our salaries to be brought
up to the levels currently earned by our
civilian counterparts. By now it is be-
coming transparently obvious that Air
Board is not interested in giving us salary
justice. In fact their actions seem indi-
cative of a desire to indefinitely postpone
the matter. Because we are Service
officers, we are expected to suffer in
silence. No professional association is
permitted to plead our cause. We cannot
even communicate with our local mem-
bers of parliament. Is it any wonder
that our morale is low?

MANNING CLARK
Sir,
I congratulate you on publishing the
two verdicts on Professor Manning
Clark’s new “Short History of Austra-
lia” (8/2/64). I once attended lectures
at an Australian university where the
lecturer used a prescribed textbook to
point out its utter unsuitability as a text,
containing as it did a different slant to
the politically oriented views of the
lecturer concerned. Two factors are
raised from this experience: the possibi-
lity of an unimpartial textbook and of
a non-objective lecturer.
There does appear a need for acade-
mic objectivity in influencing the minds
of impressionable young people towards
the truth of their historical heritage.
Professor Manning Clark’s texts are
already being widely used in our places
of learning, and have the attractiveness
of scholarship, newness and good pre-
sentation. Let us hope that the influence
of Mr M. H. Ellis will remain as a
balancing force to influence our teachers
to guide our students in interpreting the
reality of our past.

“ANY QUESTIONS”
Sir,
To justify the withdrawal of “Any
Questions”, as Mr Frank Roberts does
(8/2/64) on the grounds that one can-
not expect discussion that is at once
succinct, entertaining and serious, is one
more example of our Australian pro-
vincialism.
One would not mind the loss of one
TV show if one could say that the ABC
provided adequately for controversy. It
does not. As a Christian, I would wel-
come programmes in which non-
Christians expressed their view; as one
uncommitted to a political party, I would
gladly listen to discussions of policies and
of personalities (such as the BBC pro-
vided after the succession of Sir Alec
Douglas-Home); as one concerned for
immigration reform, I would be delight-
ed if the reformers or their opponents
had a chance to put a case; but in
these and other areas practically nothing
occurs.
If the ABC would insist on taking
more initiative many of us would sup-
port it: if, for example, it had more talks
and published even a small-scale counter-
part to “The Listener” to record them,
I would subscribe and encourage every
one of my students and other friends to
do so.

MR SANTAMARIA
Sir,
Peter Coleman makes assumptions
and assertions regarding the Democra-
tic Labor Party, with emphasis on the
Victorian Branch. Mr Coleman made
his judgments without reference to any
representative of the DLP in this State,
and the party disagrees with his version
of its origin and control. The DLP is
not aware of any proposed negotiations
with the ALP. Any such negotiations
could only be undertaken by members
authorised by the DLP Federal Execu-
tive, and decisions could only be made
by the DLP Federal Conference.

Sir,
Peter Coleman's “Santamaria”
(15/2/64) is very good indeed; yet one
feels that the role of Sydney’s Catholic
hierarchy has been treated with great
generosity. All the problems which arose
between Santamaria’s Catholic Social
Movement and the NSW bishops finally
condensed into the one issue, namely
who was to control the “Movement”?
Sydney demanded that all political de-
cisions must be submitted for ratification
to the bishop of the diocese: Santamaria
and the “Movement’s” executive said
that this would lead to paralysis, and
claimed that their independence was
vital. It thus came about that the mem-
bers of the “Movement” were actually
trying to keep the bishops out of politics.
It is difficult to see how the main
determinant in the Sydney hierarchy’s
attitude can be anything else but the
majority Catholic holding in New South
Wales of ALP parliamentary seats. If
this interest were jeopardised by another
Catholic organisation the conflict would
be very distressing to the bishops. Hence
their efforts to neutralise the “Move-
ment” in NSW.

KANGAROO TAIL SOUP
Sir,
I have read with interest your article
“Making the Pennies Jingle” (15/2/64).
It is true as reported by you that the
Australian and overseas reaction to our
Master Foods Kangaroo Tail Soup jingle
was really terrific, but we would like
to point out that in the article you have
incorrectly described this soup as being
in the “gourmet class” at 3s. 6d. per
tin. The soup is in fact very reasonable
in price, and has been sold “on special”
as low as Is. 7d. per lOoz. can of double
concentrated soup. Its regular retail
selling price is between 2s. and 2s. 3d.
per can.

THE GERMANS AT STALINGRAD
Sir,
In reviewing Professor Manning
Clark’s "Short History of Australia”,
Mr M. H. Ellis (8/2/64) is severely
critical of the section dealing with the
Second World War, and he quotes Pro-
fessor Clark to the effect that the Rus-
sians “trapped several hundred thousand
men, the flower of the German Army,
at Stalingrad” (my emphasis). Whilst
not wishing to enter into what amounts
to yet another round between these two
protagonists, it ought to be pointed out
that the use of the word “several” by
Professor Clark is hardly justified. The
figure for the German loss at Stalingrad
is given by Professor S. H. Roberts in
his “History of Modern Europe” (1951,
Book VII, Chapter IV, p. 577) as
300,000 men, whilst, in a foreword to
the German documentary film “Blitz-
krieg”, Lt.-General Sir Brian Horrocks
put the figure at 180,000.
Indeed, it seems to be the popular
myth, in Left-wing circles particularly,
that Stalingrad represented the greatest
annihilation battle of the Second World
War; and one hardly in fact virtually
never hears any mention made of the
truly catastrophic losses suffered by the
Russians in 1941 at Minsk, Kiev,
Vyasma and Bryansk.
In “The Struggle for Europe” (1959,
Fontana Edition, Chapter IV, p. 89)
Chester Wilmot mentioned that the Ger-
mans claimed the capture of 665,000
Russian soldiers as prisoners at Kiev in
September, 1941, Hitler having called
this “the greatest battle in the history of
the world”. Adding figures for those
killed, missing and wounded, it is to loss
on this sort of scale that the phrase
“several hundred thousand men” might
be more accurately applied.
If the Americans, to use Clark’s
phrase, were “scattered like chaff” in the
early stages of the Pacific struggle with
the Japanese, one might be forgiven for
using another farmyard figure of speech
in saying that in the early stages of the
Russo-German war the Germans reaped
a military harvest of staggering propor-
tions!

DEFENCE
Sir,
I congratulate you for publishing the
article headed “A Crash Programme for
Defence” (8/2/64), and the condensa-
tion headed “The Defence Bureaucracy”.
These are articles that every Austra-
lian should read, but I suppose that un-
fortunately there is not more than per-
haps 5 per cent of the Australian people
who take a real interest in either national
or international affairs, particularly de-
fence; hence it should be apparent to our
politicians that it is futile to consult
public opinion in this respect.
G. A. S. GIVEN
Brisbane (Old).
Sir,
Thank you for the February 8 issue
of The Bulletin. Firstly, it was a de-
light to read the articles on defence. In
particular “Plain English” puts the whole
problem and answer very clearly. Let
us sincerely hope, for the sake of not
only ours, but also Asia’s future security,
that Canberra does something practical
about it.
Secondly, I appreciate your fairness in
printing two and not just one review of
Manning Clark’s book. The two views
expressed leave the reader with rather
mixed thoughts on just how much he
could be influenced by the particular
leanings political, moral, etc. —of
a particular reviewer.

THE WAR-TIME ARMY
Sir,
In his review of “The Final Cam-
paigns” (15/2/64), Ek Dum states that
by reducing the Army’s strength
by 90,000 between late 1943 and
June, 1945, the Australian Govern-
ment “extinguished” “the final doom
of any idea that Australians might
be among the military land forces
who would set foot in conquering
battles on the shores of Japan”. This
remark might lead young readers to the
erroneous conclusion that Australia
maintained an unduly small army in the
last phase of the war.
In late 1943 Australia had 732,000
men and women in the three Services,
drawn from a population of 7,270,000;
the United States, for example, had
11,700,000 people in the Services, from
a population of 135,000,000.
In the second quarter of 1945, after
having reduced the strength of the
Army by about 20 per cent, Australia,
by maintaining six divisions in the field,
was still making a larger contribution
of fighting formations, relative to popu-
lation, than the United Kingdom or the
United States.
In fact, as General Blarney said, the
Australian Army in 1945 was called
upon to undertake its “maximum effort”
of the whole war.

MUSLIMS IN INDIA
Sir,
I write this in reply to Mr M. Rah-
man’s letter on the Indian Army
(8/2/64). After an absence of 10 years
I visited India in 1962. The propor-
tion of Muslims in the army is not less
than the percentage in population of
this community. I had to visit a few
offices at New Delhi. I found Muslim
heads in these Government offices and
the proportion of high officers is pro-
bably slightly more than the percentage
of population of the community in India.
Obviously M. Rahman is a Muslim
and not an Indian. Formerly the pub-
licity for Muslims was prominent; it is
now subdued in accordance with the
secularism of the Government of India.
The Government does not want to stress
the religious aspect of persons for
very obvious reasons. The Government
Muslim College in Madras is now called

LAWYERS FOR N. GUINEA
Sir,
1 was most interested to read the
article “Lawyers for New Guinea” by
Mr John Kerr, QC (15/2/64). Although
I have only recently returned from the
Territory after almost 15 years as a
lawyer in private practice there, I did
not know that the Law Council of Aus-
tralia had concerned itself with a prob-
lem of such vital importance to the
Territory, and to Australia.
It is certainly pleasing to be informed
that the Council has realised that the
legal education of the Territory’s future
indigenous lawyers must be properly
planned now, and has taken active steps
to that end.
1 have disagreed in the past with some
of Mr Kerr’s personal views concerning
the Territory, in particular with the neces-
sity of training an elite as soon as pos-
sible. But this is now resolved, for there
will be an elite and lawyers, as they
emerge, will inevitably be amongst its
most influential members.
Moreover, apart from politics, they
will have enormous influence on the
Territory’s development in law-making
and law-planning. And the men who will
exert this influence will, according to our
standards, be very young and very im-
mature. They must therefore be well
educated, both legally and otherwise, and
trained to conduct themselves properly.
Imagine the disastrous consequences of
the exercise of power by a small group
of ill-trained, ill-bred, power-conscious
lawyers!
I agree that a high-standard law
school should be established in the Ter-
ritory as soon as possible. It needs to
be in the Territory both because the
content of its courses must necessarily
differ from that in Australian law
schools, and because its teaching
methods must be more personal and
sympathetic.
As for the former, the law of the
Territory is substantially different from
that in the Australian States. For ex-
ample, apart from statute law the vast
body of civil law is, insofar as the
indigenous people are concerned, native
customary law. This differs from place
to place and one of the Territory’s
problems, very seldom realised, is the
achievement of a universal civil law
within it. As for the latter the strict
“learn it or leave” attitude of Australian
law schools will need to be considerably
modified.
I feel that, perhaps more than any-
thing else, the way in which its
indigenous legal profession is trained
will determine whether the Territory
develops peacefully under the rule of
law or is precipitated into anarchy.

FILMS
A Broken Reed
The sad decline of an English film director
By BEVERLY TIVEY
The Running Man. Director, Sir Carol
Reed. Lyceum Theatre. Sydney.
TTow sad to see the decline into medioc-
rity of a director of the calibre of Sir
Carol Reed, for so many years a recog-
nised force in the cinema. Any hack
director could have made “The Run-
ning Man” as well; many would have
made it better.
Since his pre-war debut, Reed has
made a series of films noteworthy for
their genuine flair for cinema, their
fluency and subtle feeling for atmosphere.
Reed was never one of the great direc-
tors —he seems to lack a spirit of commit-
ment to his subjects but he has been
a consistently sound and stimulating one.
Richard Winnington rightly said that
Reed “lacks the urges that make a truly
great director”. He has always been more
interested in the actual mechanics of
film-making than in what the film has
to say one feels that he would quite
happily make any film that gave oppor-
tunities for the exercise of his technical
talent, without caring particularly what
it was essentially about.
One of the early films which estab-
lished him, “The Stars Look Down”, a
story of miners in the depression, might
certainly seem to be a piece of overt
social comment, but any such comment
came from Cronin’s original novel rather
than from the director. Reed’s contribu-
tion was in his warm handling of the
human relationships and in his splendid
disciplining of the crowd scenes of strike,
riot and disaster.
Even his wartime propaganda film
“The Way Ahead” made little contribu-
tion to the war effort beyond the general
implication that the men on “our side”
were pretty wonderful despite their rough-
diamond exterior. This, of course, was
what wartime audiences needed to hear,
but Reed’s flag-waving was fairly perfunc-
tory; he was more interested in attemp-
ting (how successfully!) to turn a recruit-
ing poster into a vital and moving story
about people.
So far as any pattern may be discerned
in Reed’s choice of subject, it appears
that he has a leaning towards what has
now come to be called the “anti-hero”,
the slightly seedy misfit, a man some-
times violent in himself, always the cause
of violence in others. Leaving aside “The
Way Ahead” (a phenomenon of its
time), such a character appears in various
incarnations in “Odd Man Out”, “The
Man Between”, “An Outcast' of the
Islands”, “Our Man In Havana”.
And of course he reached his apogee
in Harry Lime of “The Third Man”. In
this film Reed did attain greatness, raising
craftsmanship to such heights that it be-
came art; a recent showing on television
confirmed that this is still one of the
most stylish and intricately constructed
films ever made.
Qhelley Smith’s neat crime thriller
“The Running Man” would then seem
an ideal vehicle for Reed—the story of a
reckless man who perpetrates an insur-
ance fraud to get money he genuinely
believes due to him, then is so bewitched
by the success of the caper that he is
drawn ever deeper into crime.
But what a soporific bore Reed has
made of it! Ponderous and lethargic, it
has not even the routine interest of a
technically capable second feature, and
the players (Laurence Harvey, Lee
Remick, Alan Bates) efficient as they
are, seem to be sharing the spectator’s
boredom with the whole affair.
And Reed, who with the Vienna of
“The Third Man”, the Dublin of “Odd
Man Out”, the Berlin of “The Man
Between”, showed himself a master at
distilling the essence of a city, here gives
us a Malaga of no more reality than a
travel brochure. His use of Spain's purely
picture-postcard aspects guitars, gyp-
sies, donkeys only further impedes
the already sluggish action.
The only sequence with Reed’s per-
sonal stamp Lee Remick’s arrival and
apparent kidnapping in Malaga is a
shamelessly unimaginative plagiarism
from “The Third Man”.

Summer
Festival
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Summer
Concerts. Sydney.
A t four recent “Summer Festival” con-
certs, the Sydney Symphony Orches-
tra at times reached a standard of per-
formance equal to anything it has done
in the last two or three years. With what
seemed to be a minimum of effort, visit-
ing conductor Carlo Zecchi got results
from the orchestra comparable with
those achieved by Horenstein and Mac-
kerras, and greatly superior to the undis-
ciplined enthusiasm whipped up by
van Otterloo. There was occasional
roughness (usually from the horns) and
lack of co-ordination, but the level of
playing was generally very high.
Curiously, the works that were best per-
formed were the old standards that ended
three concerts —the William Tell Over-
ture, Tchaikovsky’s “Romeo and Juliet”,
and Weber's overture to “Oberon”.
Zecchi’s approach to the music he
conducts was well illustrated in his treat-
ment of Bach’s third orchestral suite. The
tempos adopted for this work were very
deliberate, and within the space thus pro-
vided, Zecchi elaborated on the detail
of each movement, emphasizing or
dwelling on an important phrase, sharp-
ening contrasts, varying the tempo
slightly, and generally bringing out the
rhetorical value of the music. This could
easily have been overdone, but Zecchi
never permitted the music to lose
momentum or become diffuse: the rheto-
rical gestures almost invariably inte-
grated with and enhanced the total effect.
The one unsuccessful movement of the
suite was the Air, which has no detail to
speak of, and whose interest lies wholly
in the melody: this was taken so slowly
that continuity was almost lost.
Zecchi’s easy and natural balance be-
tween the demands of rhetoric and good
form showed to best advantage in his
account of Beethoven's Fourth Sym-
phony. This much underrated work’s
combination of strength and geniality was
well suited to Zecchi’s temperament and
technique. Haydn's Hundredth Symphony
came off less well: the first and last move-
ments were taken rather fast, without
any compensating gain in clarity.
One of Zecchi's former pupils, Romola
Constantino, was soloist in Chopin's first
piano concerto. Miss Constantino demon-
strated once more that she is a musician
of great intelligence and sensitivity, who
would probably have a notable career if
she didn't live in Australia. In some ways,
Miss Constantino’s playing is better
suited to chamber music than to the
orchestral platform—it is orientated more
towards delicacy and intimacy than to-
wards power and declamation. Neverthe-
less, her performance of the Chopin con-
certo was outstanding, and it was enhanc-
ed by Zecchi’s sympathetic handling of
the orchestral part.
Another local artist, David Woolley,
was soloist in a Haydn oboe concerto.
This is an early work, and not a partic-
ularly notable one, but within its limits
Woolley made ample use of the oppor-
tunities it provided for him to show off
his fluent technique and his unfailingly
careful and intelligent phrasing. It is re-
grettable that he was not heard in a more
substantial work.
The other soloist was the violinist Berl
Senofsky, who played Ravel’s “Tzigane”
and the concertos in A by Mozart and
Bach. The most striking thing about
Senofsky’s playing is his tone. Compared
with most violinists, he sounds rather
coarse, as if (which is not the case) there
were not much resin on his bow and he
were playing further from the violin
bridge than is normal. Because of this,
the sound of his instrument was often
clearly distinguishable from that of the
orchestral first violins during the passages
in the Bach in which he played in unison
with them, and there was not nearly so
much contrast between the sounds of his
open and stopped strings as there is with
most violinists.
Senofsky’s tone, combined with his
firm attack, gives his playing a vaguely
“rugged” character, which is, according
to taste, intensified or dispelled by the
almost violent vibrato which he tends to
use on held notes. Senofsky’s mannerisms
are so striking that it is hard to say
whether the ruggedness is a substitute for
style or interpretation, or merely distracts
attention from it. It will be interesting to
hear Senofsky’s recitals, and find out how
he sounds in a situation where ruggedness
is not enough.
JOHN SMALL
THEATRE
Sweet Prince
Hamlet. William Shakespeare. Union
Theatre Repertory Company. Union
Theatre. Melbourne.
Daymond Westwell's “Hamlet” lacks
fireworks, but it is intelligent, well-
spoken and fast-moving. By means of
Anne Fraser’s multi-level set and divided
curtains, the action moves swiftly and
continuously from fore stage to inner
stage, from one side of the stage to the
other, with scarcely a pause between
scenes. This, combined with the swift,
fluent and always clear speaking of the
actors, makes for a rapid, exciting action.
There have been many fashions in
Hamlets and Kevin Colson’s Hamlet is
very much in the modern fashion. In
reaction against the pale, sighing, will-
less melancholic of the romantics, this
is a man of spirit and decision, every
inch a prince. In fact Mr Colson, aided
by his height and handsome appearance,
is the most princely Hamlet I have seen.
His performance sheds new light in the
scenes in which Hamlet displays princely
authority, princely courtesy or princely
disdain. Mr Colson also manages Ham-
let's nervous outbursts well.
VTevertheless, Mr Colson’s playing
does lack dimension. This appears in
the speaking of the soliloquies. It is here
that Hamlet should reveal his inner tor-
ment and frustration. If he is to be played
as an active and. authoritative young
prince in the scenes with other characters,
then the soliloquies must show the horror
that he feels at his mother’s incest and
his uncle’s crime, the weariness of spirit
and passionate self-disgust that clog his
will. Mr Colson’s playing leaves us only
the external obstacles to account for
Hamlet’s delay.' The supporting cast has
a well-drilled competence, but on the
whole the characters are somewhat
muted. It seems as though in hurrying
the action along to its appointed climaxes,
Mr Westwell was not prepared to allow
the actors time to develop their charac-
terisations. A notable exception is Dennis
Miller as the first player, a tiny part
converted into a bravura performance.
A less successful exception is George
Whaley whose quirky Laertes seems a
very old young man, in an entirely dif-
ferent style from the rest of the produc-
tion. Simon Chilvers’ stolid, faithful
Horatio is particularly good in the final
scene with the dying Hamlet. Brian James
as Claudius and Carmel Dunn as Gert-
rude both lack sensuality, perhaps for
the benefit of the conscript audience:
the schoolchildren. For their benefit also
the bawdy in Ophelia’s mad scene is cut.
Or is it to spare the adults of our nation
of prudes? Elspeth Ballantyne’s Ophelia,
like most Ophelias is a little insipid. Paul
Eddey, handicapped by his youth in play-
ing Polonius, makes him a sort of
paralysed buffoon.

POETRY
A Boy's Past
Flash back the brittle summers
when a boy made wise by the sea
learned of its tides and seasons.
Echo in his earshell by submarine tone
the crash of breakers threatening doom,
the round dark track of thunder.
Show faded childhood stark:
the filtered shadow framed
in the eye, image on image.
Pierce the extinct galaxy,
extract, dissect, replace
each isolated memory.
Strip away the tense skin.
Reveal the crouching demon
caged in the quivering stone.
KEITH VINCENT SMITH
Terra Australis
Here, and here only in an age of iron,
The dreamers are proved right;
No armies underlie these rolling fields,
No lost loves haunt the night,
Nor can the farmer, turning with his spade,
Bring.shard or helm to light.
Innocence, clad in brown and faded gold,
Walks up and down these hills
Where unobtrusive flickering flowers rebuke
The show of daffodils:
With sombre colours and with sparse designs
Acre on acre fills.
Paradise lingers like a tapestry:
The web has not been torn;
Luther and Cromwell, Socrates and Marx
Have never yet been born,
Nor did a glowing Florence rise to shape
The European dawn.
We are the final children of the earth
Whom knowledge has not scarred,
Delighting still in sunlight and green grass
Back in our own backyard:
Gaping, we hear the tales of adulthood
Where life is dour and hard,
Far, far away, beyond some wicked wood.
CHRIS WALLACE-CRABBE
An Allegiance
Drab skyline, yellowing papers, a fat land:
To these I am bound
Tightly and unreasonably because
I was born here, I am shaped by
These water-coloured hills and plains,
These delicate straggling creeks,
This paper blankness
On which all writing still is to be done,
Each line of meaning still to be inscribed
In joy,
in labour generating joy.
CHRIS WAĹACE-CRABBE

When I awoke from our narrow bed
the street was grumbling with dawn. My lover stirred.
I stared absurdly at love.
I washed my teeth and cleaned my face
and put on my very red tie.
It’s time, I thought, for the sun to show. This night
must cut sharply. It’s over, I thought.
The passion has left me. It’s over, I thought.
And I looked along the early, stretching street
with its citizens and trucks and whirling straw,
and saw where the sun had broken through
on to a second-rate hotel.
LAURENCE COĹINSON
The Two Islands
Caught speechless in the wind-indented hills
my mind and fingers traced the silent island
lying to the south. Those braille mountains
that strut the backbone of the land
are with me always, their counsel never scorned.
Clouds conceal their slopes,
yet I still recollect with clarity
of crystal water twisting in their alpine streams:
how day was made by sun upon the mountains .
melting
sleep and casting night across a hemisphere.
Now turning to the north T cannot see
past shallow hills and grey mist grovelling
on the valley floors. Some part I know the worn
streets, the well-thumbed rooms, the birds
scattering in the surf-stung harbour.
But these are both behind me and ahead.
And still the mountains measuring the tread
and trend of life stand sentinel to my path.
My way is with them. Down from their granite jaws,
my glacier years lead always to the sea.
MARK YOUNG
Under The Icebergs
Anchors clink in my Antarctic sea,
pianos toll their icy droplets
release them one by one to drive a bald brain mad.
To feel as feels the social world
is to risk partaking decadence.
Withstanding courts dishonesty.
Pianos comprehend no tune
(sounding urgent, sound transparent)
ice adorns their waves.
Crevasses loom too huge
for songs of human range to differ
from noise of neither shape nor innuendo.
How can I neglect my heart for impulse?
the cold is on me and a flood of sound
drags me all mad ways in turn.
My twisted shoulder whitens
my torso bends to the tide’s will,
discovers order through submission.
But my open mouth a womb of sound
expels my argument against the logic
of mountains upside-down and anchors of despair.
Frozen mountains thaw. The truth of song
becomes a current I ride beneath the waves
to greet far lands of my tongue.

A Gaggle of Gossips
Mary McCarthy’s dormitory chatter
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Group. Mary McCarthy. Weiden-
feld and Nicolson. 225. 6d.
“HThe Group” is a good name for a
novel. It is neat and arouses
curiosity; it promises an analysis of re-
lationships within a narrow framework
■—usually an exciting prospect; and it
even holds out hope for a dash of
mystery and intrigue. In fact, the title
is everything that the novel is not, and
a reader looking for any of the virtues
listed above (and for a great many others
too) will be sadly disappointed.
Here is Mary McCarthy’s recipe. For
ingredients (freshness is not essential)
you take eight Vassar girls who formed
a group in college in the class of 1933;
you add to them assorted young men
with whom they may or may not readily
mix. Toss in a few mothers (some college
“girls” themselves) and an occasional
father (eccentric for preference.) Add,
stirring briskly, a wedding (the book has
to start somewhere), a funeral (the book
has to end somewhere), a suicide, a
defloration and an attempted rape.
Season with a lengthy lecture (catalogue
supplied) on contraceptive techniques, an
essay on the comparative virtues of
breast and bottle feeding (demand or
four-hourly routine?), a tour of a mental
hospital and some observations on Les-
bianism. Moisten with a few political
references, gibes at the Yale Drama
School, theatrical gossip, party talk and
occasional domestic brawls. Pour into a
simple mould, do not allow to set too
firmly, and serve without looking. And
you have “The Group”.
I do not know, and I wonder whether
Miss McCarthy knows, what she is up
to in this novel. Not that there is any-
thing obscure or difficult about it. On
the contrary it is distinguished by a frank
triviality which might be disarming were
it not so tedious. In the first place the
tone of the book is one of dormitory
chatter; but Miss McCarthy’s attitude
towards the tone she imposes upon her
narrative is strangely ambiguous. At
times she sounds openly satirical, as well
she might and as one would expect her
to sound, at the antics and half-baked
opinions of her girls. But in the end the
conclusion is inescapable that she is one
of the group herself; there is more pride
than satire in her account of their
adventures and sayings, more sympathy
than criticism. Further, what sympathy
there is is not the proper understanding
which enables an author to reveal
impartially the foibles of his characters;
rather it is the satisfaction of a puppeteer
who happens to be a ventriloquist as
well, and who takes a pride in simultane-
ously working the strings and projecting
his well-calculated witticisms.
The result is that there is neither
depth nor coherence to the characters.
Miss McCarthy goes to considerable
trouble to supply each of the girls with
a complete outfit of distinguishing
characteristics. She confers from with-
out the individuality one looks for in
vain from within. For example, one
girl comes from way out West and talks
loudly, one is a Bostonian and talks
softly, one is a rich New Yorker (English
butler and all) and twangs brightly.
Parents are supplied who themselves are
a means of identifying their daughters.
The girls are clothed, given different
hair-dos and figures, and sent forth
complete with talents (not too many),
a smattering of information and modest
plans for their future. Thus equipped,
they eat, sleep (alone or in company),
fall in love or fail to, and learn the facts
of life. And, above all, they talk incess-
antly. Every now and then they have
a reunion at which monologue becomes
dialogue, and one gets the feeling of
being condemned to a continuous Session
of girlish patter. There is surely nothing
more desperately tedious than to be
bombarded with the gossip of a women’s
college when one has outgrown the stage
of undergraduate crises and conspiracies.
A supporter of Miss McCarthy would
retort, no doubt, that the book is
funny, and that it does not consist merely
of idle conversation, but that it has some
historical interest as a small piece of
social history. To take the second point
first. “The Group” does indeed cover
the period of the New Deal —its span
is seven years from ’33 to the Battle of
Britain. There are political references—
to the New Deal, to the Democrats and
Republicans, to the Nazis and Fascists,
to the Trotskyites and Stalinists, to the
Spanish Civil War. There are reports
on social progress—the improvement in
contraceptive techniques and the treat-
ment of mental patients; advances in
maternal and baby welfare; and a few
dark references to arguments about
social protest and the rights of the poor.
On the economic front the effects of the
Depression are related in terms of the
fortunes of a particular family, whose
daughter is one of the group. As often
as possible Miss McCarthy parades her
general knowledge —of literature, the
theatre, comparative religion, myths and
legends, psychological theory and anthro-
pology. At times she seems like a quiz
kid in search of a programme.
But this conducted tour through the
political, social, economic and intellectual
walks of American life has no real
purpose or effect. In the course of it
one feels exactly like a member of
a coach party being dragged through
the Louvre, except that with Miss
McCarthy as guide one is dragged
mercilessly in several directions at once.
This historical aspect of the book cannot,
in my view, be taken seriously. To put
it bluntly. Miss McCarthy is showing
off, just as a Vassar girl fresh from
college might be expected to show off.
She loads every rift with the dross of
intellectualism. The result is a book
which is knowledgeable (as distinct from
learned), and feverishly bright from the
glare of the intellectual skating rink.
One is reminded (with relief at their
being past) of the days long ago when
one found it so hard to say “I don’t
know”, and when to be intelligent
seemed to mean to drop with gay con-
fidence the names of books one had
never read and theories one had never
understood.
It may seem strange to accuse a book
which is in so many ways determined
and opinionated of being indecisive and
hesitant. At the risk of committing the
intentional fallacy I would say that Miss
McCarthy has not considered either her
goal or her means of attaining it. Simply
at the technical level the novel is un-
certain, even shaky. There is a great
deal of unnecessary crowding in some
episodes; whereas in others the fortunes
of a particular character are left irritat-
ingly incomplete. One feels that Miss
McCarthy has tried to impose some
appearance of order on material which
has been inadequately digested, by the
obvious trick of beginning with the
wedding and ending with the funeral of
one character; in between these events
the occasional reunions of the group
lend a temporary illusion of pattern.
When to uncertainty of plan one adds
uncertainty of accent, the result is a
confused and wandering babble, a kind
of literary delirium.
One of Miss McCarthy’s characters
is an aspiring reviewer. To her the editor
of “Herald Tribune Books” gives the
following advice: “ ‘We believe here,
Miss MacAuslan, that there’s something
good to every book that should be
brought to the attention of every


reader.’ ” Even in “The Group”? Yes,
there are the talents one expects of Miss
McCarthy—cynical observation, an eye
for the absurd (especially in relationships
between men and women), a habit of
outrageous generalisation and irrespon-
sible wit. Out of all these elements she
strikes humor. But the comedy wilts
before the relentless clamour of her
narrative. When I closed “The Group”
it was with a wan relief at having
survived its gushing garrulity. If you
know what it’s like to be assaulted with
the confidences and assorted news of
someone who has been cut off from
human communication for some time,
then you’ll know what to expect if you
allow yourself to be drawn into the
interests and activities of the girls of
Vassar, Class of ’33.
Flying Pioneer
The Sky Beyond. Sir Gordon Taylor.
Cassell. 375. 6d.
VS/hen the history of Australian pioneer-
ing comes to be written in proper
perspective, it is likely that Sir Gordon
Taylor’s already great stature will grow,
for he is everything that a pioneer flying
man should be—skilful and daring, but
an example in caution; practical in every
detail of his craft; gifted with the power
of seeing ahead; never taking a risk
when it can be avoided. And cool, in-
ventive in emergency, clear-thinking and,
above all, matter of fact and treating
his flying not as a daredevil adventure
carried out with an eye to publicity
but as a serious professional avocation
calling for study and the development
of special instincts and a special kind
of automatic reaction.
The test of him as a flier is that he
has survived nearly 50 years from 1916
to the present time, flying from the time
he was a young officer of 20 in the RFC
until the present time without serious
accident. No other man with a record
approaching his has lived through it.
The air has got them all Hawker,
Hinkler, Amy Johnson, Ross Smith,
Kingsford Smith. Ulm and many more.
Taylor's record included active service
in France where, though he won a
Military Cross and was esteemed the
making of an ace, he discovered a pro-
found distaste for victory resulting .in
the death of a gallant enemy. He felt
no exultation over shooting down a rival
and found it hard to view the results
of his lethal handiwork.
He came back to Australia to “barn-
storming” for a living and took up navi-
gation as a science. Few realise how much
he did in the development in navigational
technique in an age in which the standard
method was to follow a road or a rail-
way or telegraph line and hope for the
best.
By the end of the 1920 s when he
was in his early thirties —he was born,
incidentally, on the anniversary of the
Battle of Trafalgar and is an old boy
of Armidale School —he was learning
to fly ANA Fokkers for Kingsford Smith
and Ulm over the Snowy Mountains
before the disaster of the Southern
Cloud wrote finis to the enterprise. He
was navigator on Smith’s pioneer flight
from Gerringong to New Zealand, using
his own system. He was co-pilot and
navigator with Kingsford Smith on the
amazing Lockheed Altair flight from
Anderson Park on Sydney Harbor across
the Pacific in November, 1934, and the
following May won the George Cross
by his amazing—indeed unprecedented
and never repeated feat of climbing
out several times on the wings of the
Southern Cross in flight and feeding a
starved engine with oil, thus enabling
her to return to Sydney safely after
Kingsford Smith failed to cross the
Tasman. He topped his first cross-Pacific
flight west-east in the Altair with the
first and most adventurous survey flight
across the Indian Ocean in the Guba,
mapping the air route now used by
Qantas. And he made the first flight—
a survey journey for the RAF in 1944
—across the South Pacific from Aus-
tralia.
His book is modestly and well written.
It has a matter-of-fact quality and a
simplicity which distinguish it from most
adventure books by adventurers. No
ghost hovers over its writing. And
its author is obviously more concerned
throughout with the exact details of
method, technique and procedure, even
in his moments of greatest peril, than
with excitement of adventure or the
perils of the moment and with himself.
It is an exciting book to read and a
peculiarly interesting one in that in crisis
its author seems to miss nothing in
recording both his minutest actions and
his sensations, though he is objective
about it all.
It is the kind of book such movements
as the Scouts and Outward Bound might
use as a text to teach the young
adventurer the craft of his trade. If
Burke, Leichhardt and some other
excited persons and a lot of the early
fliers had read it with seeing eyes and
attentive minds their stories might have
been different.

Parsifal
The Perfect Fool. Roy Fuller. Andre
Deutsch. 225. 6d.
T)oy Fuller has never received much
critical attention either as a poet
or a novelist, though the publication
last year of his “Collected Poems” re-
vealed him as one of the finest poets
now writing in English; and of the five
novels he has so far written, two, “The
Father’s Comedy” and “The Ruined
Boys”, are very good indeed.
Alan Percival, the hero of Fuller’s
new novel, is orphaned at an early age,
goes to live with his “poor” grandparents;
spends the war years in the navy and
after the Armistice works as a journalist
on the “New Watchman.” The novel
moves from his childhood to the collapse
of his marriage in the early years after
the War . . . Percival is a Parsifal figure,
the perfect fool, full of innocent good-
will towards others, aware of his own in-
significance and unimportance and con-
tantly astonished to find the stupid and
the corrupt in positions of power. He is
the sort of person who is easily used by
others; the intelligent “failure” in a
power and position-intoxicated world.
This novel lacks the force of Fuller’s
two best novels (Percival is too much
of a value to be a real person); but it
is remarkable for its humor and its com-
passionate observation of social behav-
ior and above all for its early child-
hood scenes with their concentration on
the discovery of outer objects and places
and inner uncertainties and fears. Fuller’s
admirers will be interested to note the
development that his prose is undergoing,
from the brief, simple sentences of his
early work to the elaborate and fastidi-
ous baroque sentences of this novel,
with their fluency and ease, their com-
mand of the virtuoso image—a develop-
ment which can also be traced in his
poetry.

Life-Struggle
Up The Junction. Nell Dunn. Mac-
Gibbon & Kee. 18s. 9d.
Oouth London is a world of its own.
Some of its inhabitants hardly ever
cross the Thames: they are born, live,
struggle and perish in the shadow of
the phallic towers of Battersea Power
Station.
Nell Dunn, a young English writer,
went to dwell in Battersea for a number
of years, but she did not go slumming.
She enjoyed the background and the
people, especially her contemporaries,
factory girls and workers. “Up the
Junction,” the unpretentious book which
resulted, is a record mainly of overheard
dialogue. That doesn’t sound impressive,
but it is. Here we have documentary
writing of the most vivid kind, perhaps
a foretaste of a novel to come.
Imagine a writer with the intuition
and faithful ear of a Criena Rohan, but
completely unsentimental, let loose
among the laundries, sweet factories and
clipjoints of a solidly working-class
district, an observer-participant without
any prejudices, and you will have an


Idea of what to expect. It’s a randy
environment and the talk of these young
girls is largely about sex. It is more
uninhibited than the talk of men would
be in similar circumstances and, possibly,
more intimately colorful. Miss Dunn’s
method is simplicity itself; she just takes
a common situation women buying
clothes from a barrow, a drinking party
among half-demolished houses, or
visitors’ hour at the Borstal and
literally lets us listen in. There is nothing
forcedly seamy about it all. The im-
pression is of vitality, not of sordidness.
Rube, Sylvie and the other girls are
born without illusions. The paraphernalia
of the Welfare State touch them only
lightly. They are very much the products
of a definite tradition (of which
Maugham caught glimpses here and
there) but also children of their time,
the ’sixties which can still be pretty
tough. Some incidents will make the
blood curdle ... I have in mind
particularly an abortion which, for sheer
brute veracity, has no equal in modern
writing.
Battersea as a district does not emerge
plastically, but the Rubes and the Sylvies
do. Susan Benson’s drawings are good
without being as strong as they might be
to support the text. The nearest Aus-
tralian equivalent is “Caddie,” the story
of a Sydney barmaid, but by comparison
it is pale and self-conscious.

TL/lany “pop”, or best-selling, novels fail
as literature because their authors
do not, or perhaps cannot, offer the
reader a significant experience in return
for his time. For that reason Taylor
Caldwell and Pamela Frankau fall prey
in their recently released novels, “To See
the Glory” and “Sing for Your Supper”,
to literary cheapness of various kinds.
Miss Caldwell’s book, “To See the
Glory”, composed of a series of tales told
to five-year-old Rose Cullen at her
grandmother's house by a group of
priests and recounted much later by Rose
to her husband, is the more serious
offender. The portrait of uninhibited,
fun-loving but highly intolerant grand-
mother is ineffectual; the transitional dia-
logue, in which small Rose contrives to
stay with grandmother, is stilted and
mechanical.
The major blemish, however, lies in
the development of the tales themselves.
They show the clear mark of an author
who wanted to entertain her reader and
teach him a lesson, but who could not
find an organic, natural relationship be-
tween the two goals. Thus, she conjures
up a world in which devils and angels
walk with equal human ease as man him-
self and as easily fall victim to the
author’s manipulation. The devil at one
point becomes a rather simple gull; at
another angels deliver golden harps
from Heaven to a blind young man. A
“doughty Scottish Chieftain” kidnaps a
bride for himself and finds he must walk
naked through his island village to keep
her.
In this world of largely religious fan-
tasy, allowable in itself, the author places
heavily sentimentalised characters, i.e.,
highly sympathetic figures who evoke
emotion from the reader but who have
little individual force. With occasional
deviations, these characters and situations
are steered mechanically into foreseeable
conclusions.
Finally, in her search for meaning in
these tales, she lapses into “theme-
pounding”, making dull, repetitive but
explicit statements of ideas to the reader,
imposing morals on the tales which they
are unable to create imaginatively. For
instance, the “doughty Chieftain” must
not take his naked trek, because, she
tells us six times:
The servile ones . . . would rejoice in
seeing the mighty brought low . . . only
the servile were therefore potential
traitors and mean-hearted ... It was
strange that the servile, and therefore
the destroyers, did so love legality . . .
(pp. 103, 106, 107).
Thus, Miss Caldwell tries to force her
religious fairy tales in line with her di-
dactic purpose; she binds them carefully
with her own direct, moral statements.
And the tales are unable to wrench them-
selves free from that grip, bcause they
themselves never really had imaginative
force.
Pamela Frankau’s novel, “Sing for
Your Supper”, on the other hand does
have its appealing moments. Miss
Frankau perceptively illuminates the per-
sonalities of the Weston children, Gerald,
16, Sarah, 13, and Thomas, 10, whose
father Phillip Weston (“Phillip Adair”)
sings for all their suppers in the summer
of 1926 as a Pierrot with his own rather
unsuccessful musical troupe, the “Moon-
rakers”. She particularly brings to life
Thomas, the stocky ten-year-old, subject
to blind rages, stolid, unimaginative but
clairvoyant, as is his grandmother.
However, she fails to fuse these child-
ren and their world into a significant
novel, partially because her attention is
diverted by her own, somewhat limited,
perceptiveness. She swoops and dips,
revealing doubts, uncertainties, and
almost-passionate pleasures of the child-
ren, their father, their summertime nurse
nanny (or “Brigstock” as the children
call her) who has been with the Westons
fourteen years; she skilfully thrusts the
new Mrs Phillip, a party-loving, insecure,
wealthy American divorcee with a boyish
twelve-year-old daughter, into the family.
But though the characters do at times
come to life, the reader is too often
aware that while remaining behind her
characters, never making direct state-
ments, the novelist is pointing to those
characters, saying even as she gives them
life, “This is my creation”. Her concern
for effect and her attempt to give value
to rather than extract it from the inter-
weaving relationships, though occasion-
ally subtly achieved, does itself rob the
total experience of the novel of much of
its significance.
Her writing is at times artificial, as
when Phillip’s ex-mistress concedes to
Nanny that being good pals is “much
more important than bed, really” (p.
108). The novelist sometimes supplies
emotional responses for her characters
unwarranted by the situations in which
she places them. Most obvious is the
casualness with which the family sails
for America at the end of the novel,
leaving Thomas, who has chosen to run
away at the last minute, quite casually
behind.
So, finally, one is led to the same
judgment of “Sing for Your Supper” as
the novel makes on “Moonrakers 1926”;
it builds a predominantly gay, sometimes
sombre, somewhat perceptive frame-
work in which the characters are
manoeuvred too visibly by the hand of
the author.

The sharpest, most enlightening articles

The Last Chronicle of Bouverie Street.
George Glenton and William Pattin-
son. Allen & Unwin. 41s. 6d.
T remember once being taken by a
Fleet Street uncle to view the chair
that Charles Dickens sat in during his
brief tenure of the editorship of the
“Daily News”. That empty chair was a
portent and a sign. It symbolised the
lack of clear direction that characterised
the latter days of the “News Chronicle”
and its evening stablemate, the “Star”.
This book, by a pair of former employees
of the “News Chronicle”, tells the sad
story of the disappearance of the two
newspapers into the maw, ironically
enough, of Lord Rothermere’s “Daily
Mail” organisation. It is sketchily written
and its Fleet Street anecdotes may not
be very interesting to the general Aus-
tralian reader. The once-doughty Liberal
newspapers deserved, and will no doubt
get, a better epitaph than this.
The “Daily News” (it became the
“News Chronicle” by absorption of the
“Morning Chronicle” in 1930) was a
great paper in its day. It fought for un-
popular causes, it championed under-
dogs and, under the cocoa-fed dynasty
of the Cadburys, it sternly eschewed the
catchpenny antics of its rivals in the
cheap daily field. The slow decline of
the “News Chronicle” began between
the world wars when the Liberal Party
was being ground to death between the
Tory and Socialist millstones. Neverthe-
less, the “News Chronicle” still had
1,750,000 readers when circulations were
pegged during World War 11. In fact,
both the “News Chronicle” and “Star”
went on earning profits until 1955. Then.
in the following two years, despite all
the huffing and puffing about a “Liberal
resurgence”, readers fell off like autumn
leaves. By 1957, the “News Chronicle”
had lost one-sixth and the “Star” one-
fifth of its circulation and the end was
almost inevitable.
Though bad management and divided
counsels had something to do with it,
the “News Chronicle” was really killed
by the political climate of the Cold War.
It must be said, however, that the paper’s
own standards of journalism contributed
to its fall. The “News Chronicle” had
housed some brilliant individuals—men
like lan Mackay, A. J. Cummings,
Vernon Bartlett and Gerald Barry—but
in its overall impression it fell heavily
between two stools. It could compete
with neither the magisterial tone of the
“Telegraph” and “Guardian” nor the
frenetic sensationalism of the “Express”
and “Mirror”. It was often cursed by an
irritating smugness, its sub-editing was
frequently woolly and its sense of news
values inclined to the whimsical. It is,
nonetheless, a tragedy that the voice of
old-fashioned Liberalism has been
silenced at last in Fleet Street.
During the sittings of the Commission
that inquired into the British Press in
1961, Sir Hartley Shawcross suggested
that the “News Chronicle” failed because
it was “neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good
red herring”. He went on to ask Sir
Geoffrey Crowther, a former member
of the Daily News Trust, whether the
paper might have survived if it had
“gone in for a little more pornography
and pin-up girls”. Sir Geoffrey replied
candidly: “I suspect had we chosen to
go in for pin-up girls they would not
have been very good pin-up girls”.

Big Sur. Jack Kerouac. Andre
Deutsch. 225. 6d.
Tack Kerouac’s “Big Sur” is his twelfth
** autobiographical novel. The first
60 pages are almost unendurable. This
reviewer was able to get through them
only in the knowledge that he was being
paid to write a review of the whole book,
not just the first hopeless, mindless,
childish pages.
Plot: Kerouac, a middle-aged off-the-
rails Roman Catholic, is living with his
mother on Long Island. He decides
to go to San Francisco. There he
immediately gets drunk. He decides to
go to a sea coast cabin near Monterey,
to be alone, to rest. He is repeatedly
frightened by trees, shadows, bridges,
animals, in fact almost anything. Every-
thing is “beautiful”. He lasts three weeks.
Back to SF where he is informed that
his mother has written from Long Island:
his cat is dead. Kerouac is shattered. He
loved that cat. He gets drunk. He visits
old friends from “On the Road'’. He
gets drunk. DEATH is everywhere. He
takes some people back to his seaside
cabin. They all get drunk. Kerouac dis-
covers that his pet mouse is dead. He is
shattered again. Too many things dying.
He gets drunk. He gets tossed into the
arms of a woman. They live together for
a week. Then Kerouac discovers that
her goldfish are DEAD. This is fantastic!
Everything he loves is dying! And it’s
his fault.
Back to the seaside cabin with his
love of one week and another couple.
Here he is drunk most of the time. He
can't sleep, he can’t eat. Suddenly, for
no particular reason, all is warm and
happy and clean. He says goodbye and
returns to his mother on Long Island.
End of plot but not end of book. We are
treated to a 22-page poem called “Sea,
Sounds of the Pacific Ocean at Big Sur”,
written during his first three weeks at
this cabin.

Rylah, or Little by Little
Further tightening of Stock Exchange listing require-
ments is reported in a responsible quarter as being held
up indefinitely because other States are proving very
slow in amending their Companies Acts along the agreed lines
of Victoria’s recently enacted Companies (Public Borrowings)
Act 1963.
NSW is the State most likely to next fall in line with
Victoria’s amending Act but it is not expected to get the
legislation through much before the end of June at the earliest.
Further progress, therefore, is at a standstill, though the
Associated Stock Exchange chairmen will probably take
another look at the matter at their next meeting.
Although the stock exchanges admit they are reasonably
satisfied with the new Victorian Act, inasmuch as it caters
for most of the main points in their submissions to the
Attorneys-General, they also say that they would probably
have gone further in instituting new safeguards for investors,
but without particularising at this stage.
One point which they discussed with the Attorney-General
was the suggestion that the quarterly and half-yearly reports
which directors of public borrowing and guarantor companies
are obliged to make to the Company Registrar should also
be demanded of all public companies, irrespective of whether
they have outstanding prior charge borrowings from the public
or not. The object of this would be to give a better measure
of security also to equity investors.
This is something that financial writers have been urging
for a long time. True, a number of companies do make
quarterly reports on trading; and some, though they are a
tiny minority, do provide profit figures with their half-yearly
interim reports. But for the most part companies show their
full hand only once a year and in a number of cases rather
too long after their balance dates to be of much use to
investors.
Apparently the Victorian Attorney-General, Mr A. G. Rylah,
is as conscious as anybody of these deficiencies in the
Companies Act but he told the stock exchanges that he would
prefer to see how the requirements for reporting by public
borrowing corporations in the new Act worked out before
proceeding further to cover all companies, whether public
borrowers or not.
llThether the stock exchanges would go this extra distance
to oblige all companies to make quarterly reports on speci-
fied lines and provide half-yearly balance sheets and profit and
loss accounts is a moot point. But the impression given by
stock exchange officers is that they would not at this stage
stretch their listing requirements so far. They agree that Mr
Rylah’s “little by little” policy is probably right and think
they cannot lead the legislature too rapidly.
However, the public is entitled to say that if it is practicable
for borrowing corporations at least to provide half-yearly
balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, then it is surely
a simple step to bring the rest of the companies into line in
that regard. In respect of quarterly reports, a much different
set of points would have to be covered than those for
borrowing corporations in the new Victorian Act.
In summary form, the main requirements in the latter are
for a borrowing corporation to say whether it has exceeded
its borrowing limits; that it has observed and performed all
the covenants and provisions of the debentures and trust
deeds; and say whether anything has happened or is likely
to happen to cause a breach, and if so what.
In its quarterly report, a borrowing corporation must also
say whether or not any circumstances affecting the borrowing
corporation, its subsidiaries or its guarantor corporations have
occurred which materially affect any security or charge
included in or created by the debentures or any trust deed,
and, if so, particulars of those circumstances.
it must say whether or not there has been any sub-
stantial change in the nature of the business of the
borrowing corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, or any of
its guarantor corporations, since the debentures were first
issued to the public and, if so, state particulars.
Finally, where the borrowing corporation has deposited
money with or lent money to, or assumed any liability of a
corporation which is deemed to be related to the borrowing
corporation, the quarterly report must show the total amounts
so deposited or loaned, and the extent of any liability so
assumed during the period covered by the report.
It is certainly strange that these requirements for the
quarterly reports do not include any reference to the trading
position of the companies concerned, which, after all, would
seem to be highly relevant for a trustee’s appreciation of a
borrowing corporation’s position. Admittedly the Act gives
trustees the right to ask for this or any other information it
might deem essential, and, indeed, trustees can ask for such
information at any time and don’t have to wait for quarterly
reports. But there is nothing like having it in black and white
in the Act.
However, if the Attorney-General is reluctant to write it
into the Act as applying to borrowing corporations, he is
unlikely to consider very seriously doing it in respect of other
corporations, and the onus of getting that reform looks
to be squarely on the shoulders of the stock exchanges.
In short, the other States should produce their new public
borrowing acts without delay, so that the decks may be cleared
for the stock exchanges as a start to take the necessary action
to make all listed companies provide a profit and loss state-
ment and a balance sheet with their half-yearly reports, and
then, later, to require companies to provide quarterly reports
with profit figures.


Playing Heads in the Sand
with Meat Agreement
Tt is not particularly easy to discern why Federal Govern-
-*■ ment authorities, and even some representatives of the
meat industry, should go out of their way to brag about
alleged benefits in the United States/Australia meat marketing
agreement.
The peevish fulminations of Texan cattle interests and
protests from a New Mexico House member do not necessarily
convert the agreement into a triumph for Australia. Perhaps
there’s consolation in feeling that the outcome might have
been worse.
What the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr C. F. Aderman,
said in the face of an initial six p.c. cut in exports to
America was true, but incomplete: “Without doubt the con-
tinued prosperity of the Australian meat industry is bound up
with the necessity of ensuring that satisfactory arrangements
are made in the United States market for Australian meat. The
agreement concluded will enable Australia to preserve approxi-
mately the present pattern of trade in beef and mutton and
permit us to obtain a reasonable share of the expected growth.”
Quite a lot can be concealed by the use of “approximately.”
During the course of the negotiations every care was taken
to spread the glad news of a growth element. Not a hint
came that this growth would have to start again from a
lower base.
The whole affair just shows how difficult primary pro-
ducers find discussions with the big battalions, despite the
gentler prospects held out by the US-originated Kennedy
Round and proclaimed ambitions to loosen up world trade.
The “Wall Street Journal” speaks of the agreement in terms
of a “voluntary accord” and considers it a “modest” gain
for the Johnson Administration.
Mr J. L. Shute, chairman of the Australian Meat Board,
at least appears consistent with earlier expressed views in
hoping that “Australia will be able to arrange her marketing
so that the classes of meat sought by the United States can be
soundly placed on other markets.”
He takes comfort from the traditional British market still
affording free entry. The UK Government, however, is hardly
likely to stop pressing its plans to reduce domestic subsidies
on farm products. The relief here may be only temporary, so
Mr Shute’s aim of developing every possible new market must
certainly be pursued.
Tin Producers Encouraged
by World Prices
A ustralian tin companies display a vigorous desire to
narrow the big gap between domestic production and
the presently required imports. Tableland (now dredging the
valuable Finche’s area), Renison and the Aberfoyle group all
have expansion moves afoot.
They must be holding a pleasantly watchful eye on the
world tin price, at this moment breaking old barriers at
around £stgll20 a ton and believed by a few experts to be
going higher.
Contrary to some earlier expectations, consumers have not
shown much restraint while awaiting the outcome of delibera-
tions between the International Tin Council and the US
General Services Administration responsible for releases from
the American stockpile.
Market opinion feels that US proposals, covering stockpile
tin for the next five years from the end of March, will turn
out to be sensibly founded upon the considerable disparity
between world supply and demand. Forward prices still con-
firm this producer optimism, which sees the spot price coming
to rest somewhere near £stg!050 a ton.
Though speaking a trifle ambiguously, an American con-
cerned in the talks gave grounds for reasonable hope by
saying “we want to develop a programme of disposals which
will maximise our sales but at the same time minimise the
problems for producing countries.”
Fibremakers Fights for
the Throwsters
"Fibremakers Ltd, whose new factory at Bayswater (Vic.)
will produce terylene fibres and yarns, will be in opera-
tion by the middle of the year, bringing its total investment
in Australia up to about £15 million and employment to
1000. It has a vital interest in the throwsters’ claim before
the Tariff Board in which increased protection is being applied
for on processed man-made fibre, Australia’s most rapidly
expanding textile industry.
The company says that unless all processed man-made fibres
are made dutiable at the requested rate of duty, the effective-
ness of the tariff will be greatly diminished because if pro-
tection is given for only one of the processed yarns (nylon
or polyester) the other could be imported and substituted in a
wide range of applications, which could be detrimental to the
local processing industry and to local raw yarn producers.
Move to Federate
Britain’s Stock Exchanges
A lthough it says that the federation of Britain’s stock
exchanges is not a foregone conclusion, the “Investors’
Chronicle” pointed out last week that the plan formulated by
the committee representing the various exchanges is a firm
and practical blueprint which, if all goes well, could produce
a workable prospectus by the middle of this year and lead to
the establishment of federation by early 1965.
Ruling the federation of Britain’s 4000 stockbrokers is a
proposed committee with strong executive powers. It would
consist of 25 members, of whom 14 would be from the Lon-
don Stock Exchange and the rest from two exchanges
outside London, the Provincial Brokers and the Associated
Stock Exchanges. A resolution in committee would require
a 75 p.c. vote to carry it, thus ruling out London dictation,
though not its dominance.
One of the plan’s main attractions is its provision for uni-
formly adequate compensation funds to safeguard investors.
The principle followed is that wherever he deals the investor
must feel assured of some ultimate and certain protection
against misconduct or misadventure by his agent.
Backing the compensation fund proposal, each member firm
of the federation will, as now required in London, have to
hold a surplus of £5000 stg. per partner of liquid assets over
liabilities. In addition each member exchange would have to
establish a compensation fund of £200 per member which
would mean a first line fund of about £800,000.
In the event of this first line fund being exhausted, each
exchange would be liable to contribute up to a further £1000
per member, providing another £4 million. These compen-
sation funds would be called upon only in the event of the
defaulting broker’s exchange not being able to meet the full
compensation.
One of the most pleasing recommendations, says the “Inves-
tors’ Chronicle” is that candidates for membership of any of
the constituent exchanges will, unless otherwise qualified, have
to undergo a three-year period of training with a member firm,
and will be required to pass a written test. (This is already
required by the Provincial Brokers’ Stock Exchange.
Another proposal is to get rid of one-man stock exchange
firms throughout Britain as London has been doing.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Challenge to Price Stability
Are we heading for a spell of inflation?
Tf, as seems very likely, the exception-
ally big rise of 7.8 p.c. in retail
sales last December over the previous
December marks a turning point for
consumption in Australia, the authorities
will be hard put to it to contain price
increases from now on. And it might be
reasonably assumed particularly if
personal incomes are given a big boost
through a substantial rise in the basic
wage as a result of the case which open-
ed last week that we are heading for
a spell of inflation later in the year.
Without going into the current strong
performances of the various sources of
income generation, the national income
details for the September quarter 1963-
64 are evidence enough of the big
build-up of personal income. This shows
that as a result of a 7 p.c. rise in wage
and salary incomes, a 29 p.c. increase in
income from farms and a 3 p.c. rise in
income of other unincorporated enter-
prises, and net rent, interest and divi-
dends received in that quarter, personal
income rose by 8 p.c. over the corres-
ponding quarter 1962-63.
Yet despite this build-up during that
quarter, consumption, as seen in both
the retail sales and national income
figures, showed no signs of bolting, even
if it was, in fact, 6 p.c. up on the like
quarter of 1962-63 compared with in-
creases of 4 and 5 p.c. in the two pre-
vious quarters.
Indeed, excepting expenditure on
motor vehicles, which rose by 18 p.c.
during the quarter, consumption in-
creased only marginally.
Tn the context of the rapid increase in
A personal incomes the sharp rise of
7.8 p.c. in retail sales for December be-
comes so significant because the rate of
increase was better by far than any other
month since these figures have been
compiled.
In view of the relative quietness of
consumption in. October and November,
this rise in retail sales in December is
likely to be swamped in consumption
figures for the December quarter. These
could turn out to show and increase
of less than 6 p.c. over the same quarter
in the previous year. (Excluding motor
vehicles, combined November and
December retail sales were only about
5 p.c. higher than in the same two months
1962.) But that is no reason for neglec-
ting to take full account of the possibility
that December was the turning point for
the propensity to consume.
If in fact the Marginal Propensity to
Consume (MPC) is increasing, its effect
would be superimposed on the rise in
effective demand occasioned by the cur-
rent strong upward trend of new income
generation which, far from slackening,
appears to be gaining in momentum.
Not only would we have an increase
in effective demand arising from a bigger
flow of new income, but a higher pro-
portion of that income would be spent
not only in the first round of spending
but in each subsequent round as it
worked its way through the economy.
TI/loreover, if in these circumstances
the pressure of effective demand on
the stream of goods available to satisfy it
resulted in higher prices, there would be
a strong possibility of the marginal pro-
pensity to consume increasing still more,
thus putting further pressure on the sup-
ply of goods.
On this familiar trail of inflation the
incomes multiplier itself will increase in
inverse proportion to the decline in the
marginal propensity to save.
[The obverse of the marginal propen-
sity to consume being the marginal pro-
pensity to save (MPS), the figure for
the multiplier is the reciprocal of the
latter (MPS). That is, if the marginal
propensity to consume is two-thirds
(meaning that, averaged over the whole
community, each person spends two-
thirds of his income and saves one-third)
and the marginal propensity v save is
one-third, the multiplier will be 3..}
Australian economists used to secept
3 as being a good round figure for the
multiplier. (L. F. Giblin was the first to
introduce the concept and adopted this
figure in 1930.) But probably it has been
rather lower than that in the last three
years say, from June, 1961, anyhow,
without being very dogmatic about it.
As a matter of fact, it is not so im-
portant to get an accurate estimation for
the multiplier so long as the authorities
(including the Arbitration Commission)
appreciate the processes at work. For
while, without tacitly admitting it, their
success in maintaining stability of prices
over the last year has probably owed
more to the low marginal propensity to
consume than to any other basic eco-
nomic factor, such policies could equally
fall victims to a sharp reduction in the
marginal propensity to save.
Nor in the coming testing period should
the authorities neglect the fact that, at
this stage of the business cycle, not only
must they take account of an increase
in the multiplier, but also must reckon
on a more frequent use of money sub-
stitutes through the more rapid activisa-
tion of bank deposits for instance, by
expansion of hire - purchase which
increases effective demand by stretching
incomes rather than by increasing the
proportion of those incomes that is
spent.
Tf the authorities are in any doubt
about the significance of money sub-
stitutes in stretching incomes, they should
refer to the erudite discussion on the
subject in the report of the Radcliffe
Committee (UK 1959) which came to
the conclusion (partly on account of the
influence of substitutes for money) that
measures to restrict the supply of
money, as for instance calls to Special
Deposit Account at the Central Bank,
were not enough in themselves to in-
fluence liquidity to the desired extent.
If variations brought about in the
amount of money are to be the means
of influencing total demand on the
economy, it has to be shown that there
is a reasonably dependable relationship
between these two quantities. But all
experience has shown the relationship to
be highly variable, depending on money-
using habits.
The Radcliffe report stressed the in-
creasing part played nowadays by money
substitutes and financial intermediaries
in promoting the process of speeding up
velocity of circulation, and it pointed in
particular to hire-purchase companies.
When a bank depositor decides to
switch part of his balance into a note
issue of a hire-purchase company, he is
expanding the effective supply of money.
His previously idle balance finances an
increase in the output of motor cars or
washing-machines or what-have-you.
The existence of efficient intermedi-
aries who enjoy public confidence (there
is certainly a proliferation of these in
our midst) can attract large numbers of
people to activate their bank balances in
this way, because deposits with these
institutions are in their opinion reason-
able money substitutes.
Thus in these circumstances they may
make the switch out of bank deposits
and the velocity of circulation will be
increased. No doubt Mr R. W. Norman,
deputy-manager of the Bank of New
South Wales, could elaborate on this.


WAGES CASE
Unions May Be Better Off
Under New System
The second of two articles by C. P. MILLS, LL.B., B.Ec., Senior Lecturer in
Commercial and Industrial Law, University of Sydney
Last week’s article suggested
that the trade unions are opposing
the employers’ one-wage proposal,
now before the Arbitration Com-
mission, because they fear estab-
lished wage differentials will be
frozen and the lowest wage earners
will be unduly harmed.
tT’o what extent
there are real
grounds for the
unions’ fears will
depend not on
whether separate
hearings are replaced
by a single inquiry,
but rather on the
formula adopted by
the Commission for
adjustment of wages. If the only change
is the procedural one, and the Com-
mission’s broad policy remains un-
changed, then the unions will have little
cause for apprehension.
The Commission in the past has, by
means of basic wage rises, gradually
improved the position of the lowest wage
earners, while at the same time main-
taining in a very general way, by means
of margins adjustments, the relativities
of those on margins at least up to the
level of the tradesman and thereabouts.
Beyond this point it has had to “taper
off” the percentage increase in the
margin to avoid the anomalous results
that otherwise would emerge in the case
of much higher rates of pay.
The dissatisfaction with which white-
collar unions have accepted the tapering-
off process is only natural —the process
is, in fact, a subterfuge by which the
Commission deals with the basic wage
and margin in one proceeding where it
has only jurisdiction to deal with the
margin. It is doing indirectly what it
cannot do directly.
The situation arises from provisions
in the Arbitration Act which require the
Commission to be constituted in basic
wage cases in a manner different from
that for margins cases; in the different
cases the Commission is really two
separate and distinct tribunals.
Although in dealing with margins and
the basic wage the same general con-
siderations may be relevant, the Com-
mission must hold two separate hearings.
The conclusions reached in one case
may be at variance with those in the
other. One bench may have to reach
conclusions on its part of the wage
either in the backwash of the results
of a recent decision of the other, or in
the knowledge that very soon after-
wards the other will have to deal with
applications for an increase in the other
part of the wage.
When the Com-
mission fixes the
basic wage at the
highest the economy
can afford, does this
mean that it has ex-
hausted the capacity
of the economy for
marginal increases?
Can th e Com-
mission in one proceeding where it can
deal only with the basic wage, say that
it will award an increase of X shillings,
so as to leave capacity for an increase
of Y% in margins?
These are the insuperable problems
that arise from the present state of the
legislation, and lead to the suggestion
that the existence of two separate
tribunals is unnecessary; why cannot a
“mixed” Commission of its Presidential
Members (having legal qualifications)
and (lay) Commissioners decide the basic
wage matters in the same way as they
now do with margins?
If this were done, the way would
be opened to consider possible adjust-
ment formulas that would avoid the
undesirable results which the unions see
as possibilities, but it would be necessary
for the Commission to clarify the
grounds on which it grants all-round
wage increases.
The settlement of industrial disputes
is, of course, only a legal fiction
necessary for constitutional reasons. In
so far as the policy of the Commission
is to ensure distribution to the worker
of his share of rise in the productivity
or prosperity of the nation, then a
uniform percentage increase in overall
wage rates appears to be appropriate.
If the aim is to improve the relative
position of the lowest-paid employees,
then the same increase in money terms
for all employees would suffice.
A combination of these two, if desired,
might be expressed in a formula such
as to increase wages by X% with a
minimum increase of Y shillings, with
perhaps a slight gradation of the in-
crease at the beginning of the scale,
such as is found at the commencement
of income tax schedules.
The tapering effect at the top of the
scale would then be unnecessary, unless
it were decided as a deliberate question
of social policy that employees on higher
incomes should not receive the full
benefits of the increased national pros-
perity.
There are other historical factors
which will operate against the abolition
of the two-part wage system. The basic
wage provides the only precise link
between male and female rates of pay;
in general the female basic wage is 75%
of the male rate, but there is no
generally recognised relationship between
the margins, although the female rate
is almost invariably the lower of the
two. Abolition of the two parts of the
wage would demand some readjustment
in this area.
There is also the question of the inter-
capital city differentials. The amount
of the present basic wage can be traced
back almost directly to the 1907 Har-
vester Award, although there have been
deliberate alterations of the amount on
economic grounds by the Court on many
occasions.
The compilation by the Common-
wealth Statistician of retail price indexes
for the several capital cities (and other
parts of Australia) led the Court from
about 1921 to include in the awards
a clause for automatic adjustment of
the basic wage according to the move-
ments of the index and, in each case,
the Court selected a city, or several
cities, or a combination of a number
of cities as the base for the adjustment.
The disparate movements of retail
price levels in different places within
Australia led to divergencies between
the basic wage rate so calculated, so
that by 1953 the Sydney figure was Bs.
above the Melbourne figure and 255.
above that for Brisbane.
Although, in that year, automatic cost-
of-living adjustments were terminated,
no adjustment has been made since to
equalise the various rates and, so far
as the present annual reviews of the
basic wage are related to retail price
levels, it is the average figure for the
six capital cities that is considered.
Another issue on which there is a
conflict of views is the period between
reviews of the wage. One large increase
every three years may well be rejected
by employers as well as employees in
preference for several smaller increases
at shorter intervals.
The abandonment of the annual
review of the basic wage on a cost-of-
living basis will not be taken kindly
by the unions, since the stability of the
index since 1961 is no guarantee of its
behavior in the future.
There will probably be procedural
hurdles in getting the employers’ pro-
posals before a tribunal with adequate
jurisdiction. There may be incidental,
although substantial, difficulties on mat-
ters of principle and, of course, the Com-
mission may prefer the old method.

INVESTMENT SECTION
More Facts Needed from PDC
Book value of Norwest assets an absolute requisite
Tf Mr E. S. Clementson can supply a
substantial proportion of the funds
needed to develop the assets of Norwest
Development Corporation Ltd, and he
really would have preferred to keep that
company as his own private investment,
onlookers are curious to know why he
was persuaded to sell his interests to
Project Development Corporation, of
which he is also managing director.
The meatworks, abattoirs, meat ex-
porting business and the three cattle
stations in the Kimberleys are a long
way from building projects.
But perhaps carving up meat is not
so different to carving up land. And
E. S. Clementson Pty Ltd once had a
dairy stud in the Liverpool district of
NSW which eventually was subdivided
into home-building lots.
Most of Norwest’s assets were
acquired since last July. The price
offered Mr Clementson for 800,000 10s.
shares, for which he presumably paid
par or £400,000, is £474,000 cash.
Norwest did have an 86 p.c. interest
in Tangible Securities Ltd, a manage-
ment type investment company, whose
major investments were in Project
Development and its associate Wynyard
Holdings.
In a placement to obtain Sydney Stock
Exchange listing for Tangible Securities,
Norwest Development was believed to
be the major vendor.
Ratification by shareholders of the
Norwest purchase by Project Develop-
ment, is required because of Mr
Clementson’s personal interest in the
deal.
It is relevant to point out that the
holders of the remaining 3.3 p.c. of
Norwest's capital include directors and
officers of Project Development.
In view of recent bitter experience,
it would be advisable for directors of
Project Development to be entirely
frank and specific as to the book value
of net assets acquired and their plans
for financing development. The alter-
native is to risk shareholders veto.
BoraPs £500,000 Windfall
HPhe one-for-one share issue announced
by Renison Ltd will add half a mil-
lion pounds to the assets of the Boral
combine in the current year.
Boral's consolidated accounts to June
30 will include the results of the Mount
Lyell Mining and Railway Co. which
has been taken over after a short battle
with a trio of overseas companies. One
of Mt. Lyell's assets is an almost 50 p.c.
interest in Renison.
The issue will be at par ss. and pro-
vides big financial gains for sharehold-
ers as the scrip is currently being quoted
around 30s. Paid capital will be doubled
from £226,000 to £452,000 by the
904,000 new shares.
Although the market price will pro-
bably slip back after the issue, it should
soon recover to present levels because
of the company’s promising future. This
would give a profit of 255. a share and
return the Boral group over £500,000
on its holding.
The 1964 accounts will reflect this
profit if the shares are sold, but not if
they are retained and included in the
balance sheet at cost.
The financial gains of the issue will
mean much more to the everyday share-
holders whose assets come nowhere near
Boral's multi-million status. Moreover,
it probably heralds a new era of deve-
lopment for Renison as the funds are to
be used as part of a major expansion
programme.
The success of future years seems
assured once we couple this programme
with Renison's big tin deposits and the
high tin price which is expected to rise
even further in the next few years. The
overseas offer for Mt. Lyell was un-
doubtedly partly due to its half interest
in such a promising little company.
Captain, Art Thou Sleeping?
TJow much longer will shareholders
have to wait before Captain Pro-
ducts, Ltd releases the purse-strings?
A 2.4 p.c. yield is not acceptable in-
definitely without indications of capital
benefit or a change in dividend policy.
The 20s. shares now bring around
68s. 6d. since the market heard that
trading for the first half of 1963-64 was
at a higher level and net earnings “satis-
factory”.
The stock was “discovered” by mar-
ket slideup a couple of years ago when
the price was approximately half of to-
day's price.
Earning rate has accelerated from
11.3 p.c. in 1957 (when the company
first went public) to 27.9 p.c. in 1962-
63, on unchanged capital of £464,000.
Throughout that period, the dividend
has been an unswerving 8 p.c. The
company now has unappropriated pro-
fits of £285,531, and other reserves of
£297,582.
Captain distributes canned seafoods,
mainly imported from Japan. More
regular shipments assist control of stock
levels and the orderly conduct of for-
ward-financing arrangements, the chair-
man said in his last annual address.
MKU Shuts Up
Shareholders of Mary Kathleen Ura-
nium Ltd will receive a 2s. 6d. divi-
dend at the end of February, after which
there will be sufficient to pay about
3s. 6d. a unit in dividends.
This balance will be distributed be-
tween the March annual meeting and
the time when profits are declared from
any future contract.
The mine is now fully on a care and
maintenance basis. The last shipment
of 530,0001 b of oxide will leave in the
next few weeks, and profit from it goes

Not for the Little Mail
TTnion Carbide Australia Ltd re-
ported briefly on trading for the
December six months, saying that sales
in all divisions had increased and pros-
pects for the rest of the year were en-
couraging.
The divisions are plastics, chemicals
and consumer products, the first two of
which have been under pressure from
imports since February, 1960.
Some advance on last year’s earning
rate of 14.7 p.c. could be expected for
the current year.
The 20s. shares, now quoted around
755. 6d., yield 2.7 p.c. About three-fifths
of issued capital is held by the US
Union Carbide Corporation.
It is definitely not a stock for the
little man, who would want compensa-
tion for such an income yield in the form
of capital benefits, of which there have
been none since the merger of Timbrol
with the US company in 1957.
Besser Vibrapac Recovers
T>esser Vibrapac Masonry Ltd re-
ported a consolidated profit of
£16,650 subject to audit for the six
months to December 3 1.
This represents a sharp reversal of
last year's form, when a loss of £30,236
was registered for the full 12 months.
Shareholders should not count on a
dividend too soon, as the company would
be wise to accumulate funds until pro-
fitability assumes some permanence.
The ss. shares are below par at
3s. lid., and the 2s. 6d. paids recently
brought only Is. lOd.
Tooling Up
TI/’ith all industry indicators pointing
** in a favorable direction, McPher-
sons Ltd, Melbourne tool merchant and
engineers’ supplier, couldn't fail to re-
port better results for the first half of
the current year to June.
All subsidiaries were busier, and all
manufacturing divisions producing at
capacity, but there were unavoidable in-
creases in expenses, directors said.
Last year's profit of £900,184 after
tax of £597,820 was a long way behind
the 1959-60 result of £1,039,658 after
£774,088 tax, but this year the com-
pany could recover lost ground.
Capital was watered by a one-for-two
bonus in those seemingly distant boom
days, after which dividend was cut from
12i to 8i p.c.
r
The company may prefer to put some
distance between its earnings and t e
83 p.c. dividend commitment before
raising the rate of distribution.
Shareholders should collect Is. Bd. per
20s. unit again next October. At 48s.
to yield 3.4 p.c. the shares could show
some gentle appreciation, provided the
present economic state continues.

Sometimes it is difficult to get the mess-
age. VENTILATION is one of the less
tangibles and not always too well under-
stood by those who may need it most.
It happens to be our business and maybe
we’re more interested, but everybody
wants better air conditions. Usually the
great need is for a controlled forced
draught throughout the whole building
more here, less there not only for
removing stale air, smoke, cooking
odours and so on, but also for replacing
continuously with clean filtered air.
Cooling in summer in winter time the
air-flow rate is cut back to a gentle level
to retain the warmth provided by the
normal room heaters. Thoroughly engin-
eered mechanical ventilation can be a
low-cost answer to most air comfort
problems.

Working Up Steam
/Confirmation of last year’s improved
dividend rate of 7 p.c. was given by
Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd with an
announcement of an interim 3} p.c.
Unaccustomed as they are to dynamic
performance by Australian shippers,
investors were not disappointed by the
report of a slight rise in group profit for
the December half-year.
Directors intoned that Bulkships Ltd
(the company running “Wollongong” and
“Mittagong”, which is 49 p.c. owned by
Adelaide Steam) was trading satisfactor-
ily. Associated Steamships Ltd was sett-
ling down smoothly, and returns from
all other activities remained at a satisfac-
tory level.
Associated Steamships is the company
formed to merge the interstate fleets of
Mcllwraith McEachern (10 ships) and
Adelaide Steam (4 ships).
The ss. shares currently bring about
7s. 4d. to yield 4.7 p.c. in income, and
a meagre 5.6 p.c. in earnings.
Win. Atkins Shines
Oydney steel and aluminium merchant
William Atkins Holdings Ltd is
pleased with its performance in the
December half-year. All subsidiaries
were profitable, and the present buoy-
ancy should continue, according to
directors.
Capital is increased by the one-for-
five bonus of last September, so it will
be interesting to see what sort of earn-
ing rate the company can turn up to
follow last year’s 18.2 p.c.
The company should be feeling the
benefits of the move to new premises at
Auburn and the additional markets
available to the aluminium subsidiary.
Current price of the ss. shares is 145.,
which compares with last year’s cum
bonus peak price of 15s. The shares
have been pretty firm so far this year,
the lowest price being 13s.
The tenor of the interim report was so
confident that they should not quickly
relapse to 13s. again except there be a
general market retreat.
STP as a Sweetener
TTigher turnover was enjoyed by Tas-
manian textile printer STP Holdings
Ltd, but the industry is facing increasing
costs, directors said in their interim re-
port for the December half-year.
Last year’s earning rate was 20.8 p.c.,
to give the ss. shares an earning yield
of 13.4 p.c. while the shares are avail-
able around 7s. 9d. The income return
is 6.4 p.c.
The company specialises in synthetic
fibres, demand for which is increasing.
New markets are being chased both
locally and overseas, sail fabrics for
yachts being one example.
STP has extended its operations vir-
tually to yarn preparation and weaving
at one end, and merchandising the finish-
ed product at the other.
To implement this policy, STP bought
a Sydney merchant, W. A. Minton Pty
Ltd, and sold a parcel of 420,000 ss.
shares to James Nelson (Aust.) Pty Ltd,
subsidiary of a Lancashire company.
This parcel was paid up to 2s. on
January 1, 1964. There will be a shil-
ling call in 1965 and a final call of two
shillings in 1966, so this seems to pre-
clude the possibility of a call mean-
while on other shareholders.
This stock could be going places, and
if it can be purchased a little below the
seller's quote of Bs. 6d., could prove
an interesting sweetener.
Swans Paddling Slowly
Qwans Ltd, Sydney hardware supplier,
was more selective in granting credit
during the half-year to November 1963,
and as a result sales were slightly lower.
Builders and sub-corporations for the
larger building projects were very com-
petitive in their tendering, and sometimes
incurred losses. (The company made no
special reference to bad debts in the last
year to May 31, 1963.)
Federal Government’s financial assis-
tance to home builders should materially
benefit the company.
The 9 p.c. dividend rate is continued
with an interim payment of 5 p.c. Last
year earnings of 10.6 p.c. gave only
marginal cover.
Asking price of 335. 3d. for the 20s.
shares looks excessive in terms of im-
mediate past performance, but the com-
pany is now entering a healthier indus-
trial climate than it has enjoyed for some
time.
Cement Works for “Rocky”

about <£ 1 \ million expanding its Bris-
bane works.
At last balance date, Queensland
Cement was in a strong working capital
position. If a call on shareholders is
necessary, preference shareholders will
benefit as well as ordinary. At least
this has been the practice in the past,
and Queensland Cement is such a
traditionalist that it is not likely to vary
its policy.
The first preference shareholders have
received dividends of 12 p.c. each year
since 1953-54, and second preference
and ordinary shareholders 10 p.c.
The widely varying yields offered on
the three classes of shares immediately
prior to the announcement 2.8 p.c.
from the ordinaries (at 725.), 3.4 p.c.
from the Ist prefs (at 705.) and 3.0 p.c.
from the 2nd prefs (at 655.) —do not
seem justified.
If anything, the first prefs should be
the most highly valued, but all three
classes should show approximately the
same yield.
Allied Mills’ Spending
A £1 million debenture issue (7 p.c.
for 15 years) has filled part of the
gap made by Allied Mills’ £1,475,000
expenditure on new properties, plant
and equipment in 1962-63.
Three small subsidiaries acquired
during the year took Allied Mills into
fresh fields olives, macaroni and
veterinary chemicals.
Allied Mills still complains that the
return on funds invested in the bakery
business is inadequate, yet it purchased
Sydney Flour Pty Ltd, maker of Betty
Sydney flour products, from George
Fielder Ltd recently.
Blackwood Directors Cautious
A fter-tax profit of J. Blackwood and
Son Ltd, Sydney steel merchant and
industrial and engineers’ supplier, rose
by 11 p.c. in the six months to
December 31.
In a cautious note, directors told
shareholders in their interim report that
if present conditions continued, profit
for the year should at least equal that
for 1962-63.
Earnings then had eased slightly, but
earning rate was a very satisfactory
26.2 p.c.
The 10s. shares are four times par,
to show an income yield of 4.0 p.c. and
earnings yield of 6.6 p.c.
Short and Sweet
Jf the takeover bid for Ark Rubber
Industries is successful (which it
certainly will be) then the company will
have lived one of the shortest listed lives
on record. It was first quoted last June.
Felt and Textiles have made the offer,
which is worth £630,000 altogether. It
represents the first outlay from the £2.4
million received when the Felt South
African interests were sold. The actual
payout in cash and shares will be just
under a half million pounds.
The two main Ark shareholders have
already parted with their 70 p.c. interest.
They are the chairman and managing
director, Mr S. G. Cubbins, and another
director Mr T. F. Osborn. They collected
12s. cash for each share. The offer for
the publicly held 30 p.c. is in cash and
shares and is worth 14s. on present mar-
ket values. Some unlucky speculators
took the price as high at 16s. when
directors issued a “don’t sell” warning
before the bid announcement.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Clouded by Surplus Funds
What can be Davis Gelatine’s intentions?
TAavis Gelatine had been operating for
” nearly three-quarters of a century
before the present company, Davis Gela-
tine Consolidated Ttd, was formed as a
prelude to public listing.
Operations were not started in Aus-
tralia until 1917, for the original business
was started in Auckland (NZ) in 1881.
Despite its “foreign” origins, the com-
pany became very highly regarded. In
November, 1959, the shares were selling
at over 17 times earnings and showed an
immediate dividend yield of 2.8 p.c.
Maybe this was in anticipation of the
new issue which did not come until the
following year, but, nevertheless, this
was the highest price paid in terms of
yield, for at the peak price of 1960 the
yield, allowing for the new issue then
announced, was 3.5 p.c.
Today the shares are around 355.,
and at this level show an immediate
dividend yield of 4.6 p.c., and the price
represents about 13.5 times 1962/63
earnings.
This situation deserves some attention
particularly as the shares are selling
below their net tangible assets value and
these assets would seem to be conserva-
tively valued.
Land and buildings are shown in the
balance sheet “at cost” (which presum-
ably represents 1955 values) less a
13 p.c. depreciation provision. Plant has
been depreciated by over 50 p.c. Stock at
“the lower of cost or market value” has
been reduced further by a £35,000 pro-
vision, and trade debtors by an undis-
closed provision for doubtful debts.
HTo assess the prospects for increasing
A dividends we must examine the past
record of such increases and the record
of earnings. On this latter count, one
must have grounds for proceeding with
caution. Early in the 1961/62 year,
the company acquired at a cost of about
£391,000 the Safre group of companies
and G. M. Skinner Pty Ltd.
From the recent chairman’s address it
would appear that this cost was divided
as to £234,000 for the Safre companies
and £157,000 for G. M. Skinner.
While it is not possible to determine
the actual contribution made to earnings
by these two acquisitions, it seems pos-
sible that they could have been respon-
sible for nearly the whole of the increase
in profits of the 1961/62 year over
1960/61. This would suggest about 131
p.c. on cost. At a guess, then, the Safre
group probably contributed about
£31,000 to earnings.
The directors’ report also suggests
that £261,000 (cost of shares £234,387
and capital profit £27,350) was received
from the sale of these companies, and
it would be surprising if this sum would
produce more than £13,000 when in-
vested “in stock exchange securities and
interest bearing deposits’’.
This means that earnings could be
down in 1963/64 by some £lB,OOO
unless an investment returning at least
12 p.c. net is found for these funds.
However, we cannot overlook that in
the edible gelatine field, Davis Gelatine
has an Australian monopoly and it is by
far the largest supplier of glues, etc.
(technical gelatine).
As the caption to the colour plate
in the last annual report points out,
edible gelatine is used in the production
of ice cream, smallgoods, biscuits, soaps,
pharmaceutical capsules, face creams
and wine.
’VTot only does Davis Gelatine enjoy
this monopolistic position in Aus-
tralia, but it is also the sole manufacturer
of edible and technical gelatines in New
Zealand and South Africa. Furthermore,
it has expanded its interests in the ad-
hesives field and produces adhesives
based on epoxy resins, polyvinyl acetate,
starch and dextrine.
Because of the methods used in Aus-
tralia for the production of gelatine, the
local product cannot compete with
United Kingdom gelatines which are pro-
duced by a cheaper method. Neverthe-
less, it would seem that adequate pro-
tection will always be available, for
Davis Gelatine has undertaken to accept
all “raw materials” from meatworks,
tanneries, fellmongers and many small
butchers.
While the company may find it diffi-
cult to increase prices unless the trend
of hardening prices mentioned in the
last two chairman’s addresses continues,
it seems fairly certain that the demand
for edible gelatine will continue to grow
with the increasing demand for the
types of food in which gelatine is used.
For the period up to 1959/60, the
chairman's address provided details of
the percentage increase in turnover.
Using 1955/56 as a base year the fol-
lowing series emerge:—
1956/57 1957/58 1958/59 1959/60
Turnover 108 119 128 137
Operating
Income (a) 105 105 113 128
Earnings 106 100 104 109
(a) Group net profit before tax, depreciation and
interest on long term debt.
Regrettably, this practice was discon-
tinued, but it would seem that turnover
was reduced substantially following the
removal of import restrictions in Febru-
ary, 1960. We must therefore pay more
attention to the accounts from 1960/61
onwards and, at the present time, it
would seem that the improvement in
profitability following the acquisition of
Safre and G. M. Skinner has only just
been maintained.
Therefore, while the basic business
is such that the ordinary shares of Davis
Gelatine should represent a safe invest-
ment, it can only be suggested that the
shares are fully priced until such time
as the company’s intentions regarding
the investment of surplus funds are
made known. £
A T this stage, it is difficult to under-
stand why the company decided to
call up further capital of £225,000 during
1962/63 since even if this increase in
cash is disregarded the disposal of the
Safre companies appears to have in-
creased the working capital position by
nearly £500,000. Bank overdraft and
deposits alone decreased by over
£BOO,OOO.
From this, one can only conclude that
the group as a whole is in a highly liquid
position and, so far as an outsider can
judge, a return of capital would have
been more appropriate than a further
call up.
The immediate dividend yield of 4.8
p.c. is attractive to a corporate investor
who receives dividends virtually tax free
but is subject to tax on interest income,
since it is equivalent to about 8 p.c. gross.
Furthermore, the dividend commit-
ment on the present capital of
£2,050,000 £164,000 has never
been covered less than 1.1 times in the
company’s history as a listed company.
The individual who pays tax on both
interest and dividends may prefer to look
for equity investments with more
exciting growth prospects.

Henry Jones’ Real Inner Strength
Fruits of Palfreyman policy may take time
By ROGER RANDERSON
“TXL” for generations has been the
label for high-class fruit products,
and shares in Henry Jones Co-opera-
tive Limited, the great Australian en-
terprise that supplies them, have main-
tained a similar standard of excellence,
although the directors’ policy of reser-
ving about 70 p.c. of the company’s
earnings to meet expanding capital re-
quirements, without compensation by
Way of bonus issues, has met consider-
able criticism.
Two recent events have intensified
the public’s demand for some of the
company’s 2,916,700 ordinary £1 shares,
which have lately been changing hands
at 81s. 9d.
One is that the latest accounts (for
the 1962-63 year, which ended last
October 31) have, by an enforced change
in accounting procedure, brought to
light some, but by no means all, of the
company’s inner strength.
This, however, should not cause the
less satisfactory results from trading in
1962-63, or other important considera-
tions, to be overlooked.
The other event is that Henry Jones’
nonagenarian chairman, Mr Achalen
Wolliscroft Palfreyman, announced at
the annual meeting a few weeks ago
that he would probably retire this year.
Whether rightly or wrongly, the mar-
ket seems to think that a bonus issue
the first since the one-for-two issue in
1927 may either just precede or fol-
low the departure of this formidable
gentleman, who has actively served the
company for the past 73 years.
TTas Mr Palfreyman been as stingy to-
wards his fellow shareholders as he
is painted, or more close-fisted than he
need have been consistently with foster-
ing the company’s stability and progress?
These are questions we are bound to
consider in due course.
“Dear” though Henry Jones’ shares
may seem to be, 50 of them is a mar-
ketable parcel and the price is really no
more than equivalence to 20s. lOd. for
a share of ss. par value.
Nothing is included in the present
market price for the goodwill of an
integrated industry stretching into other
countries and selling products to the
Value of more than £2O million a year,
Which has grown from a little business
started 108 years ago.
Indeed, purchasers of the shares at
present secure a proportion of the com-
pany’s assets at a substantial discount.
They pay 17s. 9d. in the £ of written-
down book values.
I have no doubt that the present-day
cost of the company’s assets (including
goodwill) would be far in excess of the
written-down book value of £4 12s. 4d.
per £1 share for tangible assets.
“Adequate depreciation”, according
to the directors, has been provided over
the years, and they stress that a few
exceptional revaluations of fixed assets
have had no material or significant effect
on the total book value of the group’s
assets. Stocks, especially, are valued on
an extremely conservative basis.
Nevertheless, intending investors
should not be carried away by talk about
an early bonus issue. They can cer-
tainly count on a steady 10 p.c. dividend,
because this has been paid regularly
since 1936, except in 1939 when lli
p.c. was paid.
Investors are thus assured of a divi-
dend yield of 2.4 p.c., although an earn-
ings yield of 7.9 p.c. points to better
things in the indefinite future.
As an additional benefit, they may
reasonably expert to receive each five
years the bonus element from a one-for-
six cash issue at par. Such a probability
may be inferred from the fact that three
such issues have been made in recent
years 1952-53, 1957-58 and 1962-63.
The bonus element of such issues is
reflected in receipts from the sale of
rights or getting a claim on assets in
excess of par value, together with a clear
10 p.c. return on additional funds thus
invested in the company.
However, it should be remembered
that, on past experience, there may be
an interval of four years before another
such issue is made.
As a further warning against over-
bidding for the shares, I remind readers
that each year there is a wide spread
between high and low prices, no doubt
influenced by the ebb and flow of bonus
anticipation.
We see in Henry Jones’ accounts this
year, for the first time, the effects of
converting into our more depreciated
Australian currency the book value of
assets and liabilities in overseas subsidi-
aries (principally in South Africa), to-
gether with the part of their earnings
they retain abroad. Dividends and in-
terest remitted to their parent had simi-
larly been converted for some years.
These currency conversion effects can
be measured by the extent to which
they would have lifted the published
results for the year before last (1961-62).
They appear in detail in the table below
and may be summarised as follows:
• Reserves £1,047,000, or almost
12p.c. higher than had been shown
on October 31, 1962.
% Net tangible assets backing per £1
share Bs. 6d. higher at £4 19s. Bd.
• Stated Net Profit and Retained
Earnings each £104,000 higher.
G Earning rate 35.3 p.c., which is
higher than the 31.2 p.c. shown by the
1961-62 accounts.
Since then, however, the company has
had, in the chairman’s words, “ a parti-
cularly difficult trading year”. Stiff
competition from new competitors, in-
cluding two large American companies,
reduced gross profit margins during the
year ended last October.
Earnings in 1962-63 increased by only
£.29,000 (compared with the 1961-
62 adjusted figure) to £907,900. The
company’s earning rate on capital de-
clined from 35.3 to 32.3 p.c., taking
into consideration the average amount
of capital used during the year.
Depreciation provided before arriving
at this result had increased by £28,300
(compared with the 1961-62 adjusted
figure) to £367,300.
The amount provided for income tax,
however, had been reduced by no less
than £165,400 (compared with the 1961-
62 adjusted figure) to £304,000.
Net profit last year would actually
have fallen, but for the fact that there
was a non-recurring reduction of
£90,000 in taxation payable by South
African subsidiaries.
Reserves, it is true, increased during
the past year by £660,400 to
£10,610,000.
This broadly corresponds with the
amount of earnings retained, after pay-
ing out £280,900 to meet the 10 p.c.
dividend.
But the net tangible assets backing for
each £1 share actually declined during
1962-63 by 7s. 4d. to £4 12s. 4d., as
the effect of issuing £431,700 capital
at par more than offset the year’s addi-
tion to reserves.
None of these movements during the
past year could fairly be regarded as
advancing the prospect of a bonus issue;


if anything, they tended to lessen pre-
vious prospects.
This still leaves the question open
whether the company could previously,
and can still, increase its dividend pay-
ments a question which is also im-
plicit in any discussion whether a bonus
issue can, or should, be made.
Such a matter cannot be decided
solely by reference to the current cost
of replacing a company’s assets. The
“watering” of capital, so far as existing
shareholders are concerned, may be car-
ried too far if it endangers their future
dividend payments.
Admittedly, their interests are differ-
ent from those of speculators who seek
to acquire shares not too soon before
bonus issues with a view to making
quick profits. They may even be differ-
ent front those who desire to become
shareholders on an apparently cheaper
basis.
One would think that the meagre at-
tendance at Henry Jones’ meeting this
month, as in former years, while not
necessarily indicating satisfaction with
the directors’ policy, at least tends to
suggest that shareholders are not nursing
any deep sense of grievance.
A lthough directors have complied
with an official interpretation of the
still new Companies Act of 1961 to ef-
fect currency conversions at approximate
ruling rates of exchange, they seem to
have given the clearest possible indica-
tion that they will not use “theoretical
and unrealised gross surpluses” as the
justification for a bonus issue.
Clearly, if subsidiaries abroad are to
continue to operate, the bulk of the
funds invested in them cannot be remit-
ted to Australia. Additional overseas taxes
would be imposed if retained earnings
were brought home. In any case, ex-
change controls would impede the re-
patriation of funds invested abroad.
Who is to say that in the years to
come the rand, the £NZ and even the
fsterling might not depreciate down to
the value of the £A? The creation of
an exchange fluctuation reserve of
£428,000 during the past two years thus
seems to me to be a prudent provision
by experienced directors.
The majestic simplicity of • Henry
Jones’ balance sheet reflects the policy
of building strength from within, with-
out relying at all on outside sources of
long-term finance.
It is the same policy as has raised
shares in some of our other leading
companies, such as Burns Philp, to the
status of “blue chips”. Admittedly,
Burns Philp in recent years has given
three bonus issues in rapid succession,
but the earlier policy made them pos-
sible.
In many recent years Henry Jones
would have needed a large proportion of
its retained earnings to provide increases
in working capital made necessary by
inflation, so that the cash issues were
required for the extension of fixed assets.
But the return on large shareholders’
funds, which had been about 12 p.c. in
1953-54, has recently been at the less
satisfactory rate of between 6 and 7 p.c.
Naturally, the return would be seen
to be much lower if assets were re-
valued to reflect current costs of
acquiring them.
However, it would be quite incorrect
to accept this as sufficient proof of poor
management. The problems of adapting
an old and relatively declining industry
to modern techniques and tastes are
most difficult and Henry Jones is
not yielding any ground without a
struggle. The registration of a frozen
foods subsidiary is a sign of this.
Moreover, the company, as the largest
Australian fruit exporter, has to main-
tain a competitive position in the diffi-
cult world markets, even though it is
at a disadvantage with overseas freights
against competitors.
Canners and fruitgrowefs, as Mr
Palfreyman has stated, have not re-
ceived subsidies to compensate for this,
although most other primary industries
now receive subsidies in one form or
another.
His complaint against the adverse
effect on local consumers and the
size of the home market of the recent
excise tax imposed by the Canned Fruits
Act to create a fund to assist exports
seems to be justified.
No doubt the company could, and
would, make a substantial bonus issue if
this became necessary to ward off a
“take-over bid”. The latter can scarcely
be expected because of problems pecu-
liar to the industry and the large sum
of capital that would be involved
perhaps as much as £2O million.
Sooner or later, when the earnings
position is stronger, a bonus issue, or a
higher dividend, seems to be inevitable.
But, unless I am very much mistaken,
existing and potential shareholders
should not bank too much on an early
bonus issue.
Even so, the old gentleman’s supposed
stinginess will be forgotten in time, and
it may come to be recognised that he
has been a worthy consolidator to suc-
ceed the innovating Sir Henry Jones.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Opening Up a New Field
Brolite earning rate should climb this year
earning rate ot Brolite Industries
-*■ Ltd should climb back over the
40 p.c. mark this year. Net profit will
be boosted by secondary effects from
recovery in the building industry and the
recent acquisition of the Australasian
manufacturing rights for the products
of an American company.
The significance of these rights must
be of some magnitude because directors
allocated a whole page of their annual
report and balance sheet to the acquisi-
tion under the heading “Important New
Development.”
Brolite will manufacture the plastic
coatings and vacuum metalising finishes
of the Red Spot Paint & Varnish Co.
of Indiana.
Until recent years, coated plastics
were confined to novelty usage where
high durability was not essential. Nowa-
days they are an important part of the
decorative components of consumer
goods such as television, radio and
stereo fittings and badges, emblems and
toys. The vacuum metalising finish is
another decorative process which creates
a chrome-like surface when applied to
certain plastics.
The directors believe that the intro-
duction of these two items will open up
a new field of automotive and appliance
design.
The recovered building industry should
create a bigger demand for the company’s
paints, enamels and lacquers, although
a large part of production is sold to the
industrial world, especially the motor
trade. Other products include putty, rust
and paint remover, brush cleaner, sealer
and the well-known range of “Klean-
Strip” products.
Home town is Melbourne where one
subsidiary operates. Two others cover
the business in NSW, while there is one
in each of Queensland, SA and NZ. In
addition, the company has agents in
both Launceston and Perth. The Aus-
tralian continent is thus well covered
to benefit from improvements in any
State.
The small profit rise from £125,963
to £135,779 in the latest year to
September 30 was mainly the outcome
of additions to the Sydney factory and
the installation of improved plant.
However, the earning rate slipped
back from 40.5 p.c. to 36.2 p.c., re-
flecting the £75,000 capital increase
brought about by a one-for-four bonus
during the year.
The constant rising and falling of the
earning rate is of little worry to share-
holders whose 15 p.c. dividend has
always been adequately covered. One
of the main reasons behind the high
earnings is the benefits received from
what directors call “exclusive access” to
the laboratories of British and American
paint companies. Apart from the know-
ledge gained of overseas manufacturing
improvements, the affiliation also helps
in pointing out new fields in which
Brolite products can be used.
The 1963 year saw a big jump in
working capital to £419,000 from the
£370,000 level around which it had
hung for three years. This high liquid
state must enable the company to easily
take care of increased business as it
turns up. In actual fact, it w'ould
probably be more accurate to say
that the figure is around £580,000
because the investments figure is com-
prised solely of a short-term deposit.
The only other really outstanding
feature of the balance sheet is the share-
holders’ funds section. Total paid capital
of £435,000 is heavily outweighed by
the combined reserves and undistributed
profits at <£713,000.
Fixed assets have shown a healthy
increase every year, especially in 1962,
while current assets at £656,000 have
risen by 21 p.c. over the 1959 figure.
The significance of this is emphasised
by the smaller 18 p.c. increase in current
liabilities.
A share split from 10s. to 5s. made
at the time of the bonus issue explains
the relatively low 1963 prices in the
following table. These capital moves
must have been expected judging by the
high price for the scrip in 1962.

TAUBMANS INDUSTRIES LTD
Old Favorite’s Comeback
Tt is always pleasing to report the
comeback of an old favorite after
a period in slack water.
As the only major independent pro-
ducer of surface coatings in Australia
■—the rest being private subsidiaries of
Australian or overseas companies—the
welfare of Taubmans Industries Ltd is
of great interest to the investing public.
The recession of 1961 not only hit
home building but also the production
of consumer durables and motor vehicles
which are big markets for Taubmans’
products.
In the financial and calendar year
just ended, Taubmans improved earning
rate from 18.8 to 19.2 p.c. with a
£9379 advance in profit to £455,434.
The increase is not much in itself,
but at least it confirms the recovery
of the year before. In 1960-61 the profit
fell heavily, and earning rate was only
12.0 p.c. on capital. This cautioned
directors to cut dividend from 124 to
10 p.c. Dividend has since been stepped
up to 15 p.c. for the last two years.
(Explanation for the 11.6 p.c. earning
rate in 1959-60 is that this was an
annual rate, although the actual profit
was for 15 months, owing to a change
in balance date from September 30 to
December 31.)
About half of Taubmans’ output is
for do-it-yourself and professional


painters; the rest is for factory main-
tenance, ships, industrial coatings and
cement compounds.
Paint is used today in almost every
industry for protective purposes in
mines, refineries and the steel industry,
as coatings in cans for food and drinks,
as insulation in the electrical industry,
and as primers and finishes for electrical
appliances and motor vehicles.
As the trend in building is to materials
such as glass and aluminium which re-
quire no surface coating, Taubmans is
looking for new markets and avenues
for investment.
A majority interest in Taubmans is
held by Pinchin, Johnson and Associates
Ltd of England, now a subsidiary of
Courtaulds. Technical assistance is pro-
vided by Pinchin, Johnson, obviating the
need for heavy expenditure on research.
Taubmans Cement Compounds Pty
Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary, last year
joined with Martin Marietta Corporation
of USA to form Embecon Pty Ltd to
make and market cement compounds.
Industrial Chemical Products Pty Ltd,
which used to be wholly-owned by
Taubmans, invited Farbwerke Hoechst
A.G. of West Germany last year to
take over 51 p.c. of the capital. The
company was renamed ICP-Hoechst
Pty Ltd.
Hoechst is to supply the technical
know-how, and activities will be extended
from the manufacture of pigments
(which are sold to other users in the
paint industry as well as Taubmans) to
dyestuffs and PVA dispersions.
At Sunshine (Vic.) the company makes
printing ink, which is associated with
can coatings and flexible packaging
materials. There is a licensing arrange-
ment with Fishburn Printing Ink Co.
Ltd of UK.
Taubmans’ policy is to improve plant
in order to reduce manufacturing costs.
From 1949 into the 1950 s Taubmans
spent large sums in renewing and in-
creasing manufacturing facilities which
required heavy calls on shareholders for
fresh capital. (The last was a four-for-
five issue at Is. premium in 1955-56.)
Since 5956-57, share capital has re-
mained unchanged and the company has
been very liquid.
Major manufacturing facilities (with
weekly capacity in gallons) now
comprise: St Peters and Villawood
(NSW), 35,000 gals; Sunshine (Vic.),
25,000 gals; North Largs (SA), 8000
gals; Queen’s Park (WA); Teronga (Qld),
14,000 gals; and Wellington (NZ),
20,000 gals.
In 1962-63 production of decorative
paint was transferred from St Peters to
Villawood, and currently Taubmans is
transferring its warehousing and dis-
tribution also to Villawood. The savings
should be “considerable”, the chairman
(Mr E. G. F. Horne) told shareholders
in his 1963 annual review.
Outstanding commitments for capital
expenditure not provided for in 1963
group accounts amount to £133,634,
which should not impose any strain on
finances.
Sale of 51 p.c. of its interest in Indus-
trial Chemical Products meant that com-
pany’s profit is no longer consolidated,
and only included to the extent of divi-
dend received in 1963. Further, its
depreciation and tax are not included in
1963 group provisions, hence the decline
apparent in the last year's provisions.
Taubmans is increasing nominal
capital from £2.5 to £5 million, not
with any immediate intention of using
the capital, but to give the company
room to manoeuvre if an opportunity
should arise. ThL is a hint of possible
takeovers for the future.
The company is not likely to re-enter
a phase of such heavy capital expendi-
ture as it was called upon to make in
the ’sos. Future development should
be within the company’s limits to finance
itself. The company depends very little
on outside sources for funds.
Thought of revaluation does not seem
to have entered directors’ minds, and
while the earning rate was low, a bonus
would have been pointless.
If the company were to pursue its
policy of diversification into allied fields
by the use of its share premium, the
chance of a bonus for shareholders
would be increased, but at present a
free distribution does not appear to be
in the immediate offing.
The present yield of 4.5 p.c. (while
the shares remain at about 16s. 8d.)
seems quite low enough.

TOWNSON AND MERCER H’GS (AUST.) LTD
Reserves and Liquidity High
HThe increased emphasis being placed
on scientific training and education
can be of great benefit to Townson and
Mercer Holdings (Australia) Ltd.
This distributor of chemicals, labora-
tory equipment and scientific instruments
owes its beginning in 1929 to support
by Townson and Mercer Ltd of London.
But this company disposed of its share
interest in 1951 when the Australian
company placed 100,000 ss. ordinary
shares with the public at ss. 3d. a share.
Although the shares are listed only
on Sydney Stock Exchange, Townson
has subsidiaries in every State except
WA as well as a strong subsidiary in
New Zealand. These companies handle
considerable defence orders, as well as
having distribution rights and agencies
from various overseas groups.
Capital growth has been slow although
a one-for-three share issue in 1955 and
a one-for-10 in 1959 have lifted paid-
up capital from £150,000 in 1951 to
£275,000 at last balance date.
Profit earning has been good, results
for the past five years covering the
dividend distributions almost twice. Last
year’s profit of £70,547 was equal to
25.6 p.c. on average capital employed
after tax of £47,109 and depreciation
of £3718.
Dividend for the last three years has
been 131 p.c., paid in the last two years
in an interim 6 and final 71.
Liquidity is good, although a little
tighter in the latest year due principally

Bayley Improves
T>rofit of leather tanner J. Bayley and
Sons Ltd in the six months to
December was on an equivalent basis to
the record 1961-62 year. The dividend
is unchanged at the annual rate of
124 p.c.
Last year the earning rate fell from
22.3 to 14.5 p.c. If the company could
stage a recovery to say 20 p.c. this year
(capital is higher) a present purchase at
about 12s. 6d. would show quite a res-
pectable earning yield of 8 p.c.
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Strong Lift to Portfolio
Tin stocks catch the eye
rFms must have been my special week.
Up has gone the value of the port-
folio by about £4OO.
Leading the rises were the tin stocks,
Tableland Tin and Aberfoyle. For me,
tin seems to have taken over where sugar
left off. What prompted the rise in tin
shares was, of course, the record world
tin price of £stg 1120 a ton. But for my
stubbornness to get into Renison Tin as
cheaply as possible, these would also
have been in the portfolio. After the
announcement of the 1-for-l ss. par
value issue last Monday, I tried to buy
400 shares at 28s. 6d. I missed by 6d.
The issue is almost a bonus one. Based
on 305., the right price is 17s. 6d.—a
very cheap price in this sort of market.
On the industrial side, two of the
portfolio veterans, Aeron and Elders
GM, moved up nicely. Strangely enough
the price of the other veteran, Hanimex,
has continued to stay as steady as a
rock. Nevertheless, forces seem to be
building up which could send these shares
on their upward path.
In comparison, what is annoying in
this market is the abnormal rise in prices
of stocks like Kolotex, Hestia and Jedda.
These are all backdoor-listed companies
that rely heavily on borrowed funds to
finance operations. In buoyant times this
is not a bad thing, yet it does mean that
they are under-capitalised. To use earning
rates as a primary investment guide in
these cases is not only misleading but
dangerous.
Apart from my frustrations with Reni-
son, I also failed with Emu Gravel, one
of the smallest but strongest stocks on
the market. Early in the year the shares
touched £7 15s. and then came back to
£6 7s. 6d. Alas, I missed at this price
and, rather than chase them up, I let the
order go.
The share I didn’t miss was Prasby
Industries. One sidelight of this pur-
chase was the fact that you could buy 50
shares for every one Emu Gravel. Irre-
spective of the activity, it does seem
extraordinary that any profitable com-
pany with reasonable prospects should
be selling at half its par value.
In its original state as a miniature
bowling machine manufacturer, things
didn’t go so well. Beaten to the punch
by foreign machines, heavy losses were
incurred. Jeff Jukes Pty Ltd, manu-
facturer of juke boxes and the like, was
taken over in 1961.
But it was becoming apparent that
diversify out of the entertainment field or
die was the choice of the day. So, in
due course, Prasby Knitting Mills Pty
Ltd and Patton Bros Pty Ltd were also
taken over. The former company,
amongst other things, makes ladies’
underwear and pyjamas, while the lat-
ter company confines itself to turning
out handkerchiefs.
Reversing the 1961 result, a profit of
£20,000 showed up in 1962 and the
company was able to pay a maiden divi-
dend of 3 p.c. Although profits fell back
to £10,500 in 1963, the dividend was
increased to 5 p.c. The company regards
this setback as only temporary.
In the chairman’s address last Decem-
ber, it was stated that every effort was
being made to earn a profit large enough
to eliminate the past loss carried for-
ward (£12,600) and to pay at least a
5 p.c. dividend (£12,000). If this does
eventuate, the shares must move up.
Selling came easily this week. A pro-
fit of £152 was shown after the sale of
the Elders GM at 295. The remaining
Santos left the portfolio at 20s. 6d.
Confirmed oil investors will regard this
trading action as betraying the cause.
Too often, however, has one (namely
myself last year) been left in the lurch
with a “good” oil share.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 Elders GM, 29/- £714
200 Santos, 20/6 £2OO

2000 Prasby, 2/7 £267
After paying the application money on
the Aberfoyle rights, I’m left with a
balance of £302 in the account.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Is Wool Board Doing Its Job?
A blunt letter from Japan
Australia sold more wool to
Japan in the six months ended in
December, 1963 than to her next
two biggest customers.
Figures released by the Com-
monwealth Statistician, Mr Archer,
show that Japan bought wool worth
£67,100,000 and was followed by
Britain, £40,700,000, and France,
£23,500,000.
Japan’s purchase was up £2O
million on the corresponding
period in 1962.
/Vther people have
” been saying the
same things for two
years but the public
generally was un-
aware that anything
was wrong with
Australia’s wool clip
until the popular
Press, radio and TV
featured the letter
written by Mr Kura-
shige, in Tokyo, to
Mr R. Rowland
Smith, in Sydney.
Mr Kurashige is
president of the Japan Wool Importers’
Association, and has the support of the
Japan Wool Spinners’ Association. Mr
Rowland Smith is chairman of the Aus-
tralian Merino Wool Campaign.
Mr Rowland Smith sent copies of
Mr Kurashige’s letter to the newspapers
and other media, and it got excellent
coverage even if a good deal was left
out. The full letter shows clearly that
while Mr Kurashige finds much wrong
with our wool he also gives praise where
it is due.
His main points were that the quality
of Australian Merino wool has declined
since the war; that South Africa is
producing better Merino wool; that Aus-
tralian skirting, classing and preparation
for export have grave shortcomings.
Australia, he said, was supplying
coarse, heavy handling Merino wool
when the trade wanted soft handling
wool. Our graziers had turned to sheep
cutting heavier clips and had sacrificed
quality for quantity. They were not
impressed apparently that in the long
run they would get better prices for
better quality wool.
They were not impressed either,
apparently, that heavy handling wool
had no particular advantage over
synthetics.
JI/fucH of Mr Kurashige’s criticism has
such a familiar ring that one must
suppose that he simply did not write it
out of the blue. Obviously a good deal
of priming took place.
But if the Aus-
tralian Merino Wool
Campaign did pro-
vide the priming, no
one can blame them.
Until now their
'‘Press” has been
poor. Unlike the
Wool Board they do
not throw cocktail
parties.
And if Mr Kura-
shige, primed or
otherwise, timed the
arrival of his letter
to coincide with the
“buy-more-textiles-or-else” Japanese dele-
gation to the Tariff Board in Canberra,
no one should blame him, either.
Wool has its own politics.
What is this Australian Merino Wool
Campaign?
A small body of dedicated men,
property owners mostly, have set up a
small (by comparison with the Aus-
tralian Wool Board) office in Grosvenor
St, Sydney. There are probably no more
than a dozen men actively involved
whose aim is simple—the continued im-
provement of the Australian Merino
which makes up 85 per cent of Austra-
lia’s 160 million sheep.
True, most of the members appear
to have a “squatting” background. But
as pointed out in “Who Owns the
Country?” (Bulletin, Feb. 1) it is from
the “squatter” one-seventh of Australia’s
110,000 woolgrowers that more than
half the wool clip comes and, more
important still, the better half in terms
of quality and price.
The views of the Australian Merino
Wool Campaign committee deserve much
more respect than has so far been
granted—particularly by the Australian
Wool Board which has neither sought,
nor listened, to their frequent advice
that wool quality is slipping.
A good deal of mud-slinging has gone
on. The frequent jibe that the Wool
Board has surrounded itself with fast
talkers and slick writers who know
nothing really about wool does not really
stand up to investigation.
Nor does the jibe that the Merino
Wool Campaign is attempting to get
into wool politics. It is, perhaps, a pity
that it has not, but it would appear that
the type of grazier it can call upon is
too concerned with running his property.
If all the earlier warnings went un-
heeded, the Kurashige letter should make
the Wool Board realise it must start
pulling up its non-nylon socks.
The Board chairman, Sir William
Gunn, answered it in his typically blunt
and shrewd manner. He said he was
really unconcerned because obviously the
Japanese were up to their old trick of
putting on the pressure to depress prices.
The Merino Wool Campaign boys were
out of their depth and had taken the
bait.
This, as Sir William would have
known, would go over well with a great
many woolgrowers, strongly ex-service
and RSL types, who are always ready
to be suspicious of anything emanating
from Japanese interests.
Sir William may also be playing for
time. He must know that a good many
other woolgrowers, aware that Japan is
now easily our biggest customer, will
demand a more adequate answer.
TlThat is going wrong with the policies
' ’ of the Australian Wool Board and
the world body, the International Wool
Secretariat?
In the field of promotion, for which
there is clearly a need, it may have
allowed itself to become carried away
with the idea that promotion on an ever
increasing scale is the best way to combat
synthetics. A promotion budget of £l6
million a year is a lot of money, but
is not, as the IWS is fond of saying,
anything like the amount spent on pro-
moting synthetics.
But how is the money spent?
It goes in many different ways in-
cluding assistance to approved promotion
campaigns by manufacturers, the setting
up of various displays of the trade fair
type, and to surveys and so on.
But is wool’s image any better or any
worse than it has ever been for all these
efforts? There are many who argue
that the only really successful promotion
for wool must inevitably be the quality
of wool itself.
But it is in the areas other than pro-
motion that the biggest mistakes have
been made.
Repeatedly Mr W. J. Vines, Aus-
tralian-born director of the IWS, has
appealed to growers to step up pro-
duction so that there will be more wool
to fill markets otherwise available to
synthetics. At the same time, growers
must not expect higher prices because
synthetics will then find it easier to under-
cut wool.
Mr Vines’ plea would probably be


apartheid
As part of its campaign to promote discussion of South Africa's
racial policies the National Union of Australian University Students
authorized the printing of the Report of a special research group it had
set up to investigate the situation in South Africa.
This Report is a 20,000-word document, examining in some detail the
history of "apartheid" and its cultural roots; it also goes into some of the
political and economic aspects of the policy; it concludes with a thorough
discussion of government policies towards South Africa and what might
best be done to influence things for the good.
The Report is available free. Write to South African Campaign, Box
4044, GPO Melbourne. Please state the number of copies you require.
Authorised, Peter Wilenski, President, National Union of Australian
University Students.
sound if he were selling motor cars,
but in the case of wool it is not that
easy.
Mr Vines has, in fact, advocated the
very thing the Japanese are complaining
about, but it would be unfair to blame
him as he will be for what has
happened. The process started long
before he took office. Nevertheless, he
could have done a lot to correct it.
Production could be increased four
ways:—
• By utilising large areas of cheap
land to graze more sheep. But that’s
no good these days. Any cheap land
able to support sheep that was not being
utilised before 1900 was useless then
and still is. Open spaces we have, but
now they are very expensive to develop.
• By overstocking existing properties:
Ethically wrong, but there have been
cases of “flogging” properties with good
financial results in the short-term. But
with its inherent dangers of spreading
erosion and damage to water systems
it would not, and should not, be tolerated
by any responsible Australian govern-
ment.
• By pasture improvement. Clearly
part of the answer, but it costs money.
The majority of woolgrowers are
operating on profit margins of 4 per
cent or less. They need higher prices,
or lower costs, or both, to permit large
scale pasture improvement. In any case,
much of the best Merino country is in
drier areas where pasture improvement
would always be dicey if not impossible.
Also pasture improvement itself has
its own problems. There is a point where
costs outstrip the better returns. Much
of the decline of our wool has in fact
been encouraged by pasture improve-
ment. Longer grass more prolific
growth—has resulted in more burrs and
vegetable matter. These can be checked
but they add to the costs problem.
• By using better sheep. The other
part of the answer. But sheep, unlike
motor cars, do not come off a pro-
duction line. It takes four years, at least,
for anything really to show. Again,
where is the money to buy better breed-
ing stock to come from if profit margins
remain low?
Many of the Japanese suggestions
and the Australian Merino Wool Cam-
paign suggestions—could be implemented
now with suitable Wool Board guidance.
Classing is currently being improved
and there seems no reason why the
identification of wool types could not be
adjusted to meet the wishes of the Japan-
ese. If South Africa can do it, surely
Australia can.
Something, too, at not enormous cost,
could be done about finding ways to
eradicate the burrs and vegetable matter
of which the Japanese complain.
A suggestion (not by the Japanese)
that some of the £l6 million for promo-
tion be diverted to assist growers to get
better pastures and better sheep has been
made. While it sounds all right in theory,
it could have traps. Who would qualify
for the money? Why one grower and
not another?
This one would have to be very care-
fully considered. And supposing Sir
William Gunn were right, to reduce pro-
motion drastically could have dire
results.
But it should not be too costly for the
Wool Board to do much more than it
has to date in directions other than
promotion. There does appear to be a
case for some, if not drastic, diversion
of funds.
In his answers to the Japanese charges,
Sir William Gunn has carefully, and
cleverly, not laid it on too thick. Perhaps
he remembers the eggs thrown at him
at Hamilton (Vic.) during last year’s
campaign to win grower support for the
higher promotion levy.
In accusing the Japanese of attempting
to depress prices, he has neatly side-
stepped the real issue has quality
really slipped?
There seems no doubt at all that it
has. Too many Australian sheep men
agree; and, moreover, the Japanese are
not the only ones to complain. So have
the Bradford (England) manufacturers
and the Boston Wool Trade organisation
in the US.
Wool Board is stressing its “inten-
sive research” into the matters related
to preparation, and it cannot be denied
that it has taken steps to improve class-
ing of the clip. But other improve-
ments, notably the polythene woolpacks,
are not Wool Board but CSIRO achieve-
ments. They would have eventuated
whether we had a Wool Board or not.
Ironically the same week almost that
Mr Kurashige wrote his letter to Mr
Rowland Smith, the IWS, in London,
announced that “two years of intensive
research” into a “suitable world trade-
mark for wool” had been completed.
Only the very gullible will be im-
pressed. The trade mark that is to work
wonders in the world promotion of wool
is a circular series of thick lines giving
the overall impression of a coiled gar-
den hose.
It comes in two versions. One has the
symbol standing alone. The other has
'“IWS” stamped alongside. Imagine the
hours of thought and effort expended
here to add the IWS, or not to add
the IWS and so enormous was the
mental confrontation that apparently
someone decided on a two-bob-each way
solution.
The IWS does not say how much the
thing cost. But it proudly states that
“thousands of man-hours” went into the
operation. The “best designers” of many
countries were consulted. What would
be the rates per hour of a top designer
in Sweden or Italy?
Of course the symbol has had a prac-
tical use already.
Over the past two years both Mr
Vines and Sir William Gunn have used
the “investigation into the need for a
suitable world trademark” theme as an
indication of IWS activity.
Much more activity into the things
mentioned by Mr Kurashige would seem
to be called for.

Money Cornin’ Thro’ the Rye
A little bit of luck for Mansfield
Tt always helps to have a little bit of
luck and Mansfield (Vic.) is very
lucky when it comes to growing rye
grass and Phalaris seed.
Mansfield is on the headwaters of the
Goulburn River. It is a picturesque area
nestling beneath the peaks of the Great
Dividing Range which in winter are
snow-covered. The favorite ski resort
of Mt. Buller is a short haul from
Mansfield.
Frosts are severe and this means that
weeds, prolific in warmer areas, never
seem to thrive. One of the biggest cost
consumers in the growing of commercial
seed is, therefore, kept in check by
nature.
Proximity to the mountains also is
a reason why Mansfield has a reliable
and heavy spring rainfall another
necessity for good seed growth.
Ten years ago a handful of farmers
were harvesting the rye grass seed which
grew naturally in the region as a small
cash sideline. Nobody knew exactly
how the rye grass, a non-native,
happened to be there but an interesting
theory has been put forward.
In the very early days the big station
owners used to lease out part of their
land to German farmers who, as part
of their tenure, had to sow grass in their
last season to provide grass for the squat-
ters’ sheep and cattle.
Over the years the seed from these
plots was carried by the wind or by
birds, with the result that the district
has had a much higher than average
stand of natural rye.
The Mansfield Seed Growers’ Associa-
tion now aims to make Mansfield the
“seed capital” of Australia. Already
their efforts are impressive. Last year
rye seed and Phalaris seed from Mans-
field accounted for 25 p.c. of the total
sown throughout Australia and in future
years the percentage may increase.
Most of the major seed distributing
companies in Australia buy seed from
Mansfield.
Costs are always the big thing in
farming, and Mansfield seed is popular
with the distributors because it comes
from the paddocks in a very clean,
natural state. Nobody can ever recall
a harvest which was not less than
80 p.c. clean (i.e., free of foreign matter)
in its paddock state.
Specialisation of this kind is not un-
known in Australia, but it is not nearly
so developed as in the US or Europe.
Nobody at Mansfield is yet growing
seed exclusively. Most run sheep or
cattle which, incredibly, graze the
paddocks marked for seed harvesting
for nine months of the year. It says
much for the quality of the Victorian
perennial rye which has replaced the
older “natural” rye and the Phalaris
tuberosa.
A measure of the growth of seed-
raising is the fact that four years ago
there were only four headers in the
district. Now there are 25 “all-crop”
headers which, usually in January, work
at high speed taking off the rye seed.
An acre in rye seed can return the
grower £25. If it is in Phalaris it
can be £7O, but harvesting is more
costly and the areas smaller.
No one has yet discovered a way in
which Phalaris seed can be taken off
in bulk from the standing grass as in
the case with rye. The Phalaris has to
be stooked and fed by hand into the
header.
Experiments are now going on to


SYDNEY GRAMMAR SCHOOL
College Street, Sydney, Australia
HEADMASTERSHIP
Applications are invited for appointment as
Headmaster of the Sydney Grammar School.
The School was established by the Sydney
Grammar School Act of 1854, has about
1,075 pupils (including 60 boarders) in the
senior school and 510 pupils (including 50
boarders) in the preparatory schools, and is
one of the leading independent public schools
in Australia and a member of both the
British and Australian Headmasters' Confer-
ences.
Applications, addressed to the Secretary to
the Trustees of the Sydney Grammar School,
will be received until 31st March, 1964.
Particulars and Conditions of the appoint-
ment may be obtained from the Secretary
to the Trustees of the Sydney Grammar
School, College Street, Sydney, or from the
Secretary of the Headmasters' Conference,
29 Gordon Square, London, W.C.I.
windrow the Phalaris and allow the
header to pick it up from there. If
successful this will reduce costs.
There are currently about 45 growers
in the Seed Association and great hopes
are held. Because of its “hidden valley”
isolation from the mainstream of road
and rail communication, Mansfield has
been largely denied dairying and other
closer farming operations. The growing
of commercial seed may point the way
to its future.
Brown Eggs are the Rage
Poultry business in Britain is big time
Tt is a mystery, really, why people pre-
fer brown eggs to white. Probably
it is just because there are more white
than brown.
Perhaps it all starts in childhood when
to get the brown egg while the others
have white is a mark of special favor.
At any rate, it has been proved that
as far as vitamins are concerned a white
egg is no different from a brown.
But to capitalise on our preferences,
or our foolishness, a number of English
poultry breeders are striving to come up
with hens which lay only brown eggs.
Their efforts, to date, are impressive. In
Kent a Mr Reginald Powis has a flock
of 30,000 layers and 27,000 of them are
brown-egg layers. He is converting to
100 per cent brown layers.
The birds he favors are the Thornber
404 (poultry breeds now have names
that sound like jet aircraft). It looks
something like a Rhode Island Red.
Thornber is a commercial breeding
company and does not willingly release
details of its breeds. It maintains its
own geneticists and research staff.
Between 70 and 80 million “4045”
have come off the assembly line (as
poultry are multiple breeders, unlike
sheep and cattle, the expression is valid),
and it is said they are responsible for
one-third of all the eggs consumed in
Britain.
Thornber’s are currently working on
an improved strain of the “404” which
possibly will be named the “707”.
It is conceded that the top strains of
white-egg hens lay more eggs but shell
quality favors the “404”. This is just as
important as the number of eggs laid,
because only eggs with good quality
shells can be marketed in Britain.
More cleaning also is needed with
white eggs.
The poultry business in Britain is big
time (and the trend that way is increasing
here, too).
Mr Powis, in Kent, with 30,000 brown
layers is forced to go for the brown egg
“gimmick” to combat the huge produc-
tions of some of the automated egg
factories.
One firm has plans for four egg farms
each with two million birds. Each farm
would produce 500 million eggs a year.
They will be operating by 1966. By
that time, on present trends, the brown
eggs will have become more common
than white in Britain. What happens
then?
Perhaps the youngsters will be saying:
“I want the white egg, Mummy”.
