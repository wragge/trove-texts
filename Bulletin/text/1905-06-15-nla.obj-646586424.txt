THE WITTIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD
'V'S'T'HO t France at least might say
WW Sophie Arnould, and it would
" * be difficult to justify greater
claims for another. “Beautiful,
gracious,” saysGaboriau, “charming enough
to make the Pompadour jealous ; of so bright
a spirit that she could lend wit to Beau-
marchais ; as sceptical as Diderot ; more
luxurious and lavish than Beauj on ; cynical
enough to make La Clos blush ; and finally,
by Garrick’s admission, an actress of genius ;
—such was Sophie Arnould. Hers was the
eighteenth century, and she has all the
seductions, all the licenses; graces, elegances,
attractions, audacities of her epoch.” Born in
1744, she. made her debut at the Opera before
she was fourteen jrnars old, and from her first
appearance had prodigious success. For
twenty years she remained a queen of the
stage, caressed and adored. Love and fame
she knew in fullest measure ; gold was poured
into her lap. Then, as she grew old, the
fickle public forsook her, and even (to its
disgrace) ridiculed her without pity. She
spent years of poverty and wretchedness,
forgotten by everyone. Then a pathetic
appeal to the Government was successful,
and her last days passed in comparative
peace. She died in LBO2. ‘Her last words
to her confessor were: “I am like the
Magdalene, much will be forgiven me be-
cause...! have loved much.”
J*
One may renew acquaintance with this
brilliant creature in Sophie Arnoidd, Actress
and Wit, by R. B. Douglas (Paris, Chas.
Carrington, 13 Faubourg Montmartre ; 215.).
In a handsome volume, adorned with fine
engravings by Lalauze, Arnould is worthily
treated apparently for the first time in Eng-
lish. Mr. Douglas’s work is good and sym-
pathetic ; and, despite lapse of time, his
volume holds no small share of the original
fascination of his subject. It is a book to be
treasured. Of its atmosphere of the de-
cadent French monarchy one can give no
idea. Sophie herself is shown scintillating
continually. Her caustic wit was exercised
at the expense of all, but plrhaps especially
against operatic rivals ; and it is no wonder
that she was hated and feared. One per-
former, Mile. Peslin, angrily told Sophie
never to mention her name again. “Say
nothing either good or bad about me ! ”
“ Oh, my dear,” cried Sophie, “I am afraid
I shall not be able to more than half obey
you.”
After ruining a host, Mile. Beau-
menard married one of the actors of the
theatre. Her charms by that time had faded,
and she led a tolerably regular life after her
marriage. Alluding to her early,career, Some-
one said that she was then like a weather-cock,
veering round to a fresh admirer every day.
“Yes,” answered the ever-ready Sophie,
“ and very like a weather-cock in this also,
that she did not become fixed till she was
rusty.” Mile. Guimard, another butt for
Sophie’s wit, was' very tall and thin,’ and
many jokes were made about her long, lean
figure. Sophie Arnould said that when she
saw Mile. Guimard dance a pas de trois
with two male' dancers, Gardel and Dauber-
val, it put her in mind of two dogs fighting
for a bone.
A writer named Chevrier was in the pay
of the police, to whom ‘he used to purvey all
the scandal of the theatre. Being threat-
ened by a person whom he had libelled, he
went to Holland, where he died, and the
rumour went- that he had been poisoned/
“Poisoned! ” cried Sophie Arnould when
she heard it, “ then he must have sucked his
own pen ! ” So reckless was she that she
did not scruple to jeer even at Madame de
Pompadour. A report reached the Lieu-
tenant of Police that at a supper party, given
at Sophie’s "house, some lampoons on the
Pompadour had been sung or recited. The
official called upon the actress one morning,
and the f- ' ing dialogue ensued :
“ Mademoiselle, where did you sup last night? ”
“ I don’t remember.”
“ You supped at home ? ”
“ Very possibly.”
“You had company ? ”
“ Most likely.”
“Aifiongst your guests were some persons of
high rank ? ”
“ That does happen sometimes.”
“ Who were those persons ? ”
“ I don’t remember.”
“ You don't remember the names of the persons
who supped with you last night ? ”
“No, sir.”
“But it seems to me that a woman like you
ought to remember things of that sort.”
“Yes,” replied Bophie, “but before a man like
you I am not a woman like me.”
Thereupon the Lieutenant of Police
walked away crest-fallen. This reply pro-
cured the actress a day’s imprisonment.
Mile. Clairon refused to play her part, in
an actress’s sulk. The Opera was under the
personal control of the monarch, and an
officer was sent to arrest Mile. Clairon.
“You are sent to arrest me?” said the lady.
“ Yes,” said the officer.
* ‘ By whose order ? ”
“ By the King’s order.”
“ I obey. The king may do what he pleases
with my person or with my property. My honour
he cannot touch.”
And, said Sophie, when she heard of this
speech : “Of course he can’t. Where there
are no effects, the King cannot seize.”
Jt
Mile. Allard, a pretty and young woman,
whose very numerous love affairs had as-
tonished and almost shocked even the
nymphs of the opera house, was once boast-
ing in the green room of the suceess she had
met with in a boy’s part she was then play-
ing. ‘‘l am sure half the audience thought
I was a man,” she declared. “Perhaps so,
dear,” said Sophie, maliciously, “but the
other half knew you were not.” It was
Sophie Arnould, by the way, who originally
said that the best way to support the opera
was to lengthen the ballets and shorten the
skirts.
Sophie met a doctor with whom she was
acquainted crossing a wood on his way to visit a
patient. An ardent sportsman, he was carrying
a gun in case he came across any game on his
road. Sophie asked him where he was going, and
he replied that he was bound for a neighbouring
village to see a sick man. The actress glanced at
the gun and said quietly, “Are you afraid of
missing him ? ”
These are some of the sayings of Sophie’s
prosperous period. “Unfortunately,” says,
Gaboriau, “success turned her head. One
could make a book of nothing but her
follies.” Ingenuously she herself admitted
that to Yoltaire when the great writer called
upon her. “Madame,” he said, “I am
eighty-four years old. I have committed
eighty-four foolish acts.” “Dear me,” said
Sophie, “that’s nothing. lam not yet
forty, and I have committed already more
than a thousand.” With such stories is
Douglas’s book filled, and the tithe of them
has not been gathered.
A REAL ANTHOLOGY
Dear Sir,—lt has reached my ears that several
Eersons, assuming names resembling my own,
ave commenced to compile anthologies of Aus-
tralian poetry. To prevent base and spurious
rivals from howling, I beg to state that I have been
engaged on this work for the past 500 years, and
have secured works hitherto unpublished by .the
poets in question.—Yours, etc., 1.0. Stiffuns.
P. S. —I enclose the f ollowing specimen anthology
for your perusal.
O’D— wd is etymological:
LANGUAGE.
I am the morbifuge of mind,
The alkahest of oaths ;
With picric phraseog rams,. Mankind
I separate from clothes ;
With verbal volts electrify
God’s guernseyed anthropoids,
Who, in arenas, avidly
Pursue prolate spheroids.
Archaic epithets I boom
In corybantic chords ;
Cacophonously I exhume
Lexicographic hoards.
Stentorian styptics I apply
To languages unstrung ;
I, Tarrawingee, fluxify
Each triturated tongue.
For euphony alone I live,
Combined with epigram;
For normal speech I do not give
A polyandrous dam.
Though Juggernaut of Speech ahead
May forge xvith Age’s ■weight,
Its petrol-perfumed 'path I spread
With torpid tacks of Hate.

P—t —rs—n meets Clancy:
1 was thinking out-my leader
So profound, and didn’t heed a
Boy who came into my office from the advertising floor;
Till he broke upon my fancy,
Crying, “ Please, sir, Mr. Clancy" —
And the Man from Blowy River, he was standing at the
door.
And upsetting piles of pens, he
Hashed and grabbed my hand in frenzy,
And he said : “ 1 've lost no bloomin’ time in givin’ yer a
look ;
I ’ve the firmest nag as ever
Was projuiced on Blowy River,
An' I’ve brought him down ter Sydney an’ I’m goin’ ter
run him crook.
“ An’ a chap who ’s proved a toff is
Well deserving of the office,
An’ I ’ll put yer fly a week before each time we ’re goin
ter lose.
If yer take advantage of it
Yer ivill find a heap more profit
Than in writin’ anti-Socialism far the Ev’nin’ Noose.”
A& I felt the tear-drops welling
From my eyes as he ivas telling
Of the prads of old Monaro who could eat these city weeds,
And the honest hands that held ’em
On the plains I visit seldom —
Of the noble-hearted sportsmen that the Blowy River
breeds.

Fr—ulc M— rt—n mandolines to the same old
girl:
The sun’s sweet warmth of hisses,
The cheeks so red and brown,
These are September’s blisses
Above your muslin gown.
Not glories transcendental,
No harsh old Gothic runes,
But sweetly sentimental
My pound-a-column tunes.
B—df—rd also grows sentimental:
THE BALLAD OF ZOPHAR THE NAAMATHITE.
The boils like Western sunset blazed and bled , .
Chrome rail the elemental matter’s tracks ;
Crepusculous, the hybrid Hebrew said,
“ Why bibber thus thy rutlish coronachs ? ”
Said Job, the blainey Jew : “ My neck is cursed
Carbunculously by my gutless gods ;
The nuances of kosher liebenvursts
Serve but to pungify my emera&s.”
Then Zophar spake : “ 0 carcinomous lout!
Take from der shynagogue thy Jrested hairs !
Vot, jettison thy Makers! Cast dem oudt
Undt breat’ to dem no more thy sclilenter prayers l ”
Poised Job himself upon his twingeing toes,
And dirtier than Sodom’s dust, a right
Swung he upon the figure-six-like nose,
And there was peace in Palestine that night.

Gr —nt H —rv —y rushes into a harem:
THE GARDEN OF GIBLS.
Reach down the sky to make a quilt
To cover me at night,
As broad and blue as all the verse
That I in frenzy write.
Pluck me some stars before I give
The firmament a rest,
To wear when next I do the Block,
As buttons on my vest.
My garden's planted thick with girls
■ Ablaze with budding charms ;
Their blooms are scarlet glowing Kps,
Their branches shining arms.
The cultivator’s boundless love ;
The planter’s fervent bliss ;
Hark while I tell you of the tarts
That I, Gr —nt II — rv — y, kiss !
» Envoi.
So bring the sky and bring the stars,
And bring some bosoms white,
And bring me ME, the greatest fact
Of which I, H—rv—y, write.
GR—NT H—RV—Y.
P—rb—ll tells of heroism:
There is no man in history like noble William Green,
The noblest best Australian lad who ever yet was seen ;
Some battlefields show heroes to a limited, extent,
But he was game enough to say exactly what he meant.
’Twas there the Melbourne populace his daring, deed did
meet,
Down at the awful fire at 34 M’Guiness-street,
Where a girl was shrieking wildly from the 27th floor,
And her parents wept they’d not see their darling daujhier
more.
• Will no one save me?” loud she cried, straight down a
look she sent,
Thin gazed with horror into the devouring "element.
Bu t the cowardly crowd were silent as 'the poor girl cried
and moaned,
Till young William . Green came forward and he bravely
said “ I won’t."
And in all the books of history no braver deed was seen
Than the words of that Australian boy, the noble William
Green ,
J_ M _S P—RT—LL... One penny.
Og—lv— stumbles on romance:
“ Ride sivift across the Border I ”
That was the final ivord,
Yet by the whispered order
The wattle-trunks icere stirred.
I -wage a fevered battle
For love of Kate O'Brine,
When 1 go duffing cattle
Across the Border Line.
For the bright glory flashes
Of tivo things sound and sweet.
For every girl has lashes,
And every cow has feet ;
And these my songs shall ravage
The whole of New South Wales,
II idle women’s ways,are savage,
And bullocks all have tails.

Br—d — is technical:
Out flops the helm to larboard,
Up scrapes her poop astern ;
’Fore God, we’ll singe her garboard
Should Hell the mizzens burn!
Lord help the cox, he’s twit chin';
But all the blooming time
The poet’s ship goes pitchin’
Along the seas of rhyme.
For we’ve tied the ship together
With a rummy trochee twist.
(Blow 1 let the winds blow)
If there’s parts of her forgotten,
Wy they never will be missed.
(Hoe ! it’s a hard row)
While ive sing to bleedin’ landsmen
(Yo-ho, bully boys, let her go !)
Of the gals the sailors kissed.
(Yo-ho, bully boys, let her go !)
K. J. B R—D—
H.G.
“ The repudiation of demonstration in any but
immediate and verifiable cases that this Scepticism
of the Instrument amounts to, the abandonment of
any universal validity for moral and religious pro-
positions, brings ethical, social, and religious teach-
ing into the province of poetry, and does something
to correct the estrangement between knowledge and
beauty that is a feature of so much mental existence
at this time.’’ Clearly, a man who writes like that
doesn’t know his writer’s business. But it is H.
G. Wells ! in the appendix to A Modern
Utopia (Lond., Unwin; 2s. 6 d.). Then H. G. Wells
does n’t know his writer’s business. The sentence
is not typical, but it is not singular. A Modern
Utopia is difficult to read, and counts for nothing
because Wells has not force enough to handle
abstract ideas firmly. He wants the Concrete to
make his image clear. In Anticipations he had
it; and Anticipations was a good book. In
Mankind in the Making he was losing it ;
and Mankind was pretty fair. Now, in
A Modern Utopia, lie has lost it; and his abstrac-
tions remain unvitalised ghosts. As a philosophic
romancer Wells is brilliant, triumphant; because
he has people and a plot to collect and focus the
rays of his delicate imagination. His philosophic
speculations are too far diffused.
Noticing a German translation of George
Moore s Evelyn Innes and Sister Teresa, Jhe
Academy points out that German critics consider
Evelyn Innes and Owen Asher the artistic
types of psychological drawing since Flaubert,
and urge that “in them Moore has attained the
zenith of soul-analysis.” This is little more than
Moore’s due. As realistic writer he is the finest
modern artist in English, and the next English
generation may realise it.
In Waves of Fate (Lond., Blackwood; 2s. 6d..)
Edward Nobie writes a clever story that will
intensify an hour and leave a memory. (Inciden-
tally, he shows Katherine Thurston how the
doppel-ganger may be truthfully handled John
Chilcote” was a bright impossible.) The bea
looms large : Noble views it romantically, yet prac-
tically ; Conrad’s mystery is not in his mental fibre.
He makes excellent we'ar-a-day fiction and a little
better: one thinks he could make a lot better.
But "that would mean larger space, closer work,
and (possibly) a book less saleable. As current
reading his work serves well as it stands. It is
Mr. Noble’s ill or good luck that I laubert and
Meredith have preceded him.
“ I am sixty-five years of age,” said Sir Hiram
Maxim to an interviewer, “ and I remember dis-
tinctly that my father told me that his grand-
father had said that England was evidently going
to the dogs.” But in the fable, you remember,
the wolf really did come at last.
Edison believes that he invented the call
“ Hello ! ” fof the telephone. He has a habit of
saying “ Hello ! ” to everybody, and naturally
shouted it into the ’phone. But why do yo u say
“Hello”? As good as anything else, to be
sure; yet why not anything else ? Imitation
habit—law. One would not be surprised to learn
that all motion started from all rest precisely in
that way—by the variation of a single enterpris-
ing molecule.
A. H. Full wood writes to a friend in Australia :
The Academy, so far as a few of us are concerned, is of
no use this year. Some of the boys are hung; but
Streeton is the only one on the line—really on the line.
The curious thing is that Streeton’s subject is of figures—
and very beautiful, / think. Other ©pinions vary, but all
ao-ree to beautiful colour. He doesn’t pretend to draw the
figure in an academic way, but he gets something more
into his work than mere drawing. A pure technician, of
Bourse, condemns such an outlook ; but some of the finest
works of art have been so on account of a certain naive-
ness which, of course, the mechanical mind fails to
understand. , . , ...
Lambert is hung fairly high, but in a good position, in
good company ; Longstaff the same. Minns has a small
water-colour, his first in the Academy ; and I am very
glad for he has tried for a long time. Roberts is clean
biffed, also myself and Mahony—who, by the way, seems
to have left this earth, for no one ever sees him. Roberts,
Streeton, and myself are in the New Gallery (two to me),
so that there is some record for the year, and the New
Gallerv is as good as the R.A., but not such a large show,
more especially in the eyes of the public.
May MeCtyires gives space to a Harvard pro-
fessor’s encomium of a Scotch-American teacher
named Davidson, who spoke things heard in this
vicinity. “He said it was a fixed rule with him
to form no regular habits. When he found him-
self in danger of settling into even a good one, he
made a point of interrupting it. Habits and
methods make a prisoner, of a man, destroy his
readiness, keep him from answering the call of the
moment. Individualist d outrance. Davidson felt
that every hour was a unique entity, to whose
claims one should lie open.

A TORPID LIVER.
_____________
A CATALOGUE OF SYMPTOMS.
The Case of Mrs. M. WING.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
Events which have evidently left an
impression upon the mind never to be
obliterated—events which at one time
were beheld with grief and dismay—
are here related by Mrs. Maria Wing,
of Dora-street, Hurstville, upon whom
a pressman recently called, and was
courteously accorded, an interview.
“It is twelve years ago now,” ex-
plained Mrs. Wing, “since I took Cle-
ments Tonic for indigestion and neu-
ralgia, but if it were twice that time I
should never forget how much I owe
to that remedy for its powerful cura-
tive i nil uence.”
“Had your afflictions been ini exis-
tence long ?”
•‘hjiute seven years, so you can ga-
ther from that what a wreck I was.
Even from childhood I had been a
great sullerer from nervousness, and
each year found that complaint more
fully developed then ever. When neu-
ralgia started, the pains in my jaws,
all about my head, behind my eyes,
and at the back of my neck and right
down my shoulders were unendurable.
Night after night passed by and not
an hour's sleep, with the result that,
by-and-bve, 1 felt almost dazed for the
want of rest. This, was not
the full extent of my adversities, for I
daresay you know what indigestion is
like? It meant that whenever I took
any food—and I did not have much at
a time, iny appetite being so poor—l
got a feeling m the chest like a tight-
ness, as if I had overeaten, and a
nasty, full, uncomfortable feeling also
affected me in the stomach. But the
bilious attacks I had were horrible.
Some days, from the time I got up in
the morning till the sun went down in
the evening, I could do nothing but
retch, and on those particular occa-
sions I had such a fearful sensation in
my head that I could not hold it up.
Talk about being depressed—why, that
was no name f t or it ; I was absolutely
melancholy, and what also' helped me
to be so was a continual presentiment
that something was going to happen.
Try how 1 would I could not get out
of my head the idea that some kind of
trouble was awaiting me, and if it
didn't come to-day I was sure it would
arrive to-morrow. Oh ! it was a life
that one should be pitied for leading,
and I'm sure I’ll do all I can to help
other poor women out of similar pre-
dicaments. Now I know that an infal-
lible cure is within the roach of every-
body, I consider it but right that I
should make known to the world what
that cure is, and for this reason alone
1 am actuated in going into full de-
tails. Yes, when those bilious attacks
were on I was so upset generally that
I could not oven take a drink of water.
Nothing whatever would stay on the
stomach, so it’s nothing to marvel at
that I got as thin as a shadow and as
weak as a kitten. And the giddiness
that I had to contend with. It used to
come on suddenly, and almost cause
me to fall sometimes, and it was
strange how my eyes felt so swollen
and the sight bad besides.” .
“Those are symptoms arising from
the disordered state of the liver,”- re-
marked the writer.
“Exactly, and further evidence in
support of that lay in the fact that
my mouth had a bitter taste, and 1
had a white coating over my tongue ;
and not until I had taken- some Cle-
ments Tonic could I get rid of those
symptoms cither.”
“\vhat medicine had you taken pre-
viously ?”
‘‘Nearly every kind of pills and me-
dicines ever heard of, and there was
not one of them, that was worth my
while to refer to. Such useless. trash 1
didn’t think possible could exist, and
it just shows you how advisable it is
to relate such experiences as mine so
that people's money should not be
thrown a-way. Doctors', too, they used
to attend me and prescribe medicine,
but it never came to anything. I felt
no better after taking it, and that is
why, to tell you the truth. I started
to lose hope, and think that i was
never going to get rid of my com-
plaints again. One thing that caused
me no small amount of alarm was pal-
itation of the heart, which used to
e particularly troublesome when lying
down at night, but Clements Tonic
soon set my mind at rest by making
the heart’s pulsation regular and
steady, and at the same time I ob-
served a great falling off in the bother
1 previously had with flatulence. My
chest became eased of its burdensome
feelings, and when I had been using
Clements Tonic a little while the dis-
comforts to the stomach after meals
was entirely absent. So far so good, L
thought ; but there was a lot for Cle-
ments Tonic to do still, if it w'as only
equal to the occasion.”
‘‘And was it equal to all your re-
quirements ?'
“Yes ; every one of them, and what
a lucky woman I was to be sure ! Just
fancy being almost mad with pain like
1 frequently used to be, to fruitlessly
spend money in all directions trying to
get relief, to become hopeless and de-
spondent, and then, at last, to get a
medicine hitherto overlooked which
was the very one that could cure me 1
Don’t you think I had cause to be
deeply grateful ? Ah, well 1 I sincerely
trust that my experience may rt ach
the ears of others, who will soon
know that I have spoken nothing- but
the truth about Clements Tonic. With-
out exaggeration, that remedy set me
entirely free from all the pains I have
mentioned, gave me such an appetite
that I could eat anything that was
going, and so invigorated my nervous
system that I could stand any kind of
noise without trembling, and as for
having ugly dreams or spending my
time in worrying over imaginary trou-
bles ahead, why, I never thought of
such things after being on Clements
Tonic a few weeks. And if anything
will make a person sleep soundly it is
Clements Tonic, for by using it it be-
came a regular thing for me to fall off
shortly after getting into bed, and
not till nearly breakfast time would I
wake again. Tt was a delightful change,
and it will give you an idea of the
perfect cure it was when I tell you
that I am now heavier than I have
ever been before.” .
“Well, that ought to be a good in-
dex as to your health.”
“And so it is, for I can now. work
well and enjoy the privilege of living,
whereas before taking Clements Tonic
life was only a drudgery that was not
worth enduring. I have advised dozens
of people to take Clements Tonic, and
shall always do so. You also have my
permission to publish this interview in
any way you like for the benefit of the
general community.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Hour of Dawn.
The great, slow brain of the earth is waking
O’er the solar skies ;
The white Dawn comes, and the light is breaking
From her half-shut eyes.
As slow she moves with her long skirts trailing
O’er the forest rims,
She lifts her robe of the grey nun’s veiling
From her gleaming limbs.
The praise of birds she has stayed to listen
Where the locked boughs meet;
Heroold cheek warms and the dewdrops glisten
On her bare white feet.
All sounds are still, and the soul is shaken
As it stands alone ;
The best and worst in the heart must waken
That the heart has known.
And darkness falls, by the day supplanted ;
With her eyes alight,
The Morning stands with her fair feet planted
On the prostrate Night.
And strong hearts glow, and weak ones sicken
At the sound of strife,
Of thoughts that leap and deeds that quicken
In the womb of life.

LOLA RIDGE.
The Tracks that Lie by India.
Now this is not a dismal song, like some I’ve sung
of late,
When I’ve been brooding all day long about my
muddled fate;
For though I’ve had a rocky time I’ll never quite
forget,
And though I never was so deep in trouble and in
debt,
And though I never was so poor nor in a fix so
tight—
The tracks that run by India are shining in my
sight.
The roads that run by India, and all the ports of
call—
I’m going back to London first to raise the where-
withal.
I’ll call at Suez and Port Said as I am going past
(I was too worried to take notes when I was that
way last).
At Naples and at Genoa, and, if I get the chance,
I’ll view the vine-clad ridges of the pleasant land
of F ranee.
The track that runs by India goes up the hot Red
Sea—
The other side of Africa is far too dull for me.
(I fear that I have missed a chance I’ll never get
again
To see the land of chivalry and bide awhile in
Spain.)
I’ll graft a year in London, and if fortune smiles
on me
I’ll take the track to India by France and Italy.
’Tia sweet to court some foreign girl with eyes of
lustrous glow,
Who does nob know my language and whose
tongue I do not know;
To 101 l on gently-rolling decks beneath the soft’ning
skies,
While she sits knitting opposite—and make love
with our eyes.
The glance that says far more than words, the old
half-mystic smile —
The track that runs by India will wait for me
awhile.
The tracks that run by India to China and Japan,
The tracks where all the rovers go—the tracks
that call a Man !
I’m wearied of the formal lands of parson and of
priest,
Of dollars and of “ fashions,” and I’m drifting
towards the East;
I’m tired of cant and cackle, and of sordid
jobbery—
The misty way# of Asia are calling unto me.
N.S.W.
HENRY LAWSON.
Two Flowers.
A slender lily fallen in the dust,
Its poor, wan fragrance wasted on the ground ;
Tarnished more sorely by each passing gust
And wayward footfall —Innocence discrowned.
She of the golden hair, the laughing eyes,
Pale-robed and garlanded with sweet perfume,
Strays in her walk where the sad lily lies,
And pities, ah 1 but passes the poor bloom.
The bitter afternoon fades into night.
The glow of many lamps along the pave
Shows, startled, halting in their searching light,
One of those passion-flowers He came to save.
She stood a painted girl, with flaming cheeks,
Great haunting eyes made vixen-bold with wine :
A feeble sinner of three wretched weeks,
Trembling, and broken-hearted at a sign ;
The broken lily, lying, on the road,
Spurned by the careless stream that pours along
And, passing, spurns her also with the goad
Of sneering looks, the falt’ring in the throng.
What matter that the press was curious?
She kissed the lily, and they laughed aloud ;
They held her kisses cheap and spurious.
But she had found a friend among the crowd.
A friend, ah me ! She hurried on again
To where the great waste waters flow and flow;
And when the lily touched her breast, the pain
Of loneliness-and longing seemed to go.
She kissed her friend again before she slept,
And, speaking softly, told her of it all.
“I loved him well,”'she whispered as she wept;
"But when he tired he mocked me for my fall.”
The river washed the lily’s stains away,
While Death explained to God a lost girl’s pain.
And when the sun rose on another day,
The far white beach held two flowers pure again.

of 20 years’ standing without operation, and has dis-
carded his truss. He had suffered not only from his rupture
but also from the effects of ill-fitting spring trusses, which caused'
more pain than the rupture. He had given up all hopes of a cure
until he heard of the Rice method. He tried it and it cured him.
.thousands of men, women and children have been cured by this
method without pain, danger or operation. Among them are
Mossman, via Port Douglas, Queensland; Mrs.
F Medley, 3 31 , Swan Street, Richmond, Melbourne; L. Exton
(child), 2, Harold Street, Newtown, near Sydney, N.S.W.; and
J. Westhead, River Darling, Pooncaria, N.S.W. Your rupture
cannot be worse than some I have cured. You owe it to yourself to
at least investigate carefully this method of cure. BEWARE of
any person or persons claiming to be or to have been at any time
connected with me in business in any way. Such statements are
absolutely fraudulent and devoid of all foundation. BEWARE
of all imitations of my method. The genuine Rice method can be
obtained from my London office only. I will send you a book
gwmg a complete description of rupture and its cure, and telling
why the Rice method has succeeded in so many thousands of
cases, if you will write for it. Do not be misled by worthless
guarantees, but write for my world-wide-known and tested
method. Write to-day to W. S. RICE. Runture Snarialict

Weak Nerved People
I i
This is to people who lack courage, whose nerves are
shaky, whose eyes have lost the sparkle, whose brains are
muddled, ideas confused, sleep restless, confidence gone,
spirits low, who are hesitating, unable to venture, because
they are afraid of failure, who want somebody to decide for
them. It is to people who have part or all of these symp-
toms of nervousness and want new life, new force. We
offer it to you in the
Dr. Austin Electric Belt

sleep ; it rejuvenates, animates sluggish circulation, stimu-
lates the brain to activity, and fills the body with life and
ambition.

bago, Rheumatism, Stomach, Liver, Kidney and Bowel

Any honest man or woman, who will secure us, can have our Belt, and pay for jt when I
cured. Our Belt is better and stronger than any mad@j and never burns or blisters the flesh. 1

Almost' any Practitioner can af-

are effected daily by Dr. W. Carter
Watson, Chief Physician and Sur-

He is registered by Government

undertakes your case you run no
risk. His methods of treatment
are envied by less skilful Practi-

HE IS READY TO BACK HIS STATEMENT
by a forfeit of £250, and testimonials of hundreds of cured patients, not only in Sydney, but from every
town and village in Australasia. He invites you to call and have a confidential chat about your trouble. A
thorough examination and consultation will cost you nothing, and he will explain his methods of making

16 men are employed on a section of a roof, on which 600 squares of
RUBEROID were laid. The men may be seen seated on ladders, nailing
and tin-capping the RUBEROID - The courses are lapped two inches, and
the nails are driven two inches apart from the centres. At the left of photo,
two men are engaged in nailing the roofing where it has been tucked in under

THE “PARASITE.”
The Tariff Commission, among its other delays,
wasted some time trying to find out the cause of the
prejudice which exists in Australia against Aus-
tralian manufactured goods. It had already made
quite sure that such a prejudice existed —on that
point the evidence was overwnelming—and it was
Senator Clemons, of Tasmania, who desired to go
further and ascertain the why and wherefore of
the phenomenon. It might have dawned on
Senator Clemons —but apparently it didn’t—that
he was himself a very fair sample of one cause, for
all through the Tariff inquiry he has been so over-
bearing and so truculent towards witnesses who
spoke on behalf of Australian industry, that he
seems ready to represent every Australian manu-
facturer as an enemy. Mr. Clemons’ question
was addressed to piano-manufacturer Beale, of
Sydney, who replied vigorously :
The origin of it is the continual and ceaseless antagon-
ism of newspapers and members of Parliament in their
advocacy of what they consider to be Freetrade. There
is no term of opprobrium too severe to be applied to the
Australian producer of manufactured goods. Our indus-
tries are described year after year as “tottering,”
“coddled,” “bounty-fed,” and so on, and the favorite
phrase of all is “robber industries.” This, said witness,
was more particularly from the Melbourne Argus, and
similar phrases were also used in the local newspapers.
Manufacturers felt it keenly that they should be pro-
nounced “public thieves.” Criticism of this kind was
bound to arouse antagonism in the minds of the public in
regard to Australian industry. He had heard a lady say
that she would use no article of Australian manufacture
in her home if she could obtain an imported one. She
was a lady residing in this State, and born in this State.
He had heard similar statements repeatedly from others.
The Prime Minister had stated, in effect, in his place in
Parliament, that too many members of Parliament, in
their advocacy of Freetrade, denounced Australian indus-
tries, and, on being interrupted, he said, “At least, there
is too much of it from this side of the House.”
Then |there were alarms and incursions in the
Commission, and Eowleb, M.H.R., said weep-
fully :
To say that the Freetrade members of the Federal
Parliament had at any time slandered Australian manu-
facturers was to use language which—unintentionally, he
thought—misrepresented the position. He had been in
the Federal Parliament since its establishment, and he
could not recollect a single instance of this. . . . The terms
complained of were applied to parasitical industries.
* * * *
In this matter Fowler, M.H.R., has a short
memory. One of the most disgraceful scenes in
the House of Representatives took place during
the tariff debate, when Cameron of Tasmania
appeared with an Australian-made plough-share
and an inferior imported one, and violently
■denounced the superior local article as rubbjsh,
and demanded, in effect, that the Australian
industry should be discouraged under the tariff.
And one of the most disgraceful scenes that ever
happened outside the House was when a Melbourne
importer and Freetrader, as representing him-
self and other importers and Freetraders,
was sued by their joint and several agent
or jackal for services rendered in getting the
tariff so fixed as to irretrievably cripple the
Australian distilling industry. A third case arose
only the other day when a Freetrade member of
the Commission wanted to know whether the
conduct of ex-Premier Dibbs of N.S.W., in
speaking to a manufacturer on tariff matters, wasn’t
calculated to lead to corruption—the manufacturer
being regarded as naturally corrupt. Dibbs’
Freetrade predecessor in office had not only
consulted foreign importer M‘Millan about
the tariff, but had taken him into his
Ministry and made him his Treasurer—
but that is another story. And these are
only isolated incidents and slanders amid an
ocean of slander and hostility. The charge which
is laid by honest and intelligent Australians
against most of the “ great ” Freetrade dailies of
this country, and against most members of the
Freetrade or importers’ party, is that they have
laid themselves out, by lying, slander, misrepresen-
tation and a variety of meannesses, to destroy
Australian handicrafts, to deprive Australian
artisans of work and wages and the means of
supporting their families, to block Australian
progress, to vilify Australian work, to damage
Australia’s industrial reputation, to represent its
manufacturers as robbers, cormorants, and parasites
—all of this so that the importing business might
flourish. And as the natural corollary of
this, the bulk of the importers’ press is regarded
by decent and intelligent Australians as a public
enemy, a traitor in the camp, and a spy acting on
behalf of the foe outside our gates. Fowler,
M.H.R., who couldn’t even finish his defence
against the charge of hostility to Australian in-
dustries without relapsing into his old mood and
calling these industries “ parasites,” is a fair
sample of the Freetrader’s mental attitude. The
Freetrader only objects to the parasitical manufac-
turer —but then he regards all Australian manu-
facturers as parasites.
* * * •
New South Wales has always been the home of
the Freetrade craze in Australia. It is there that
the denunciation has been loudest, and that the
impression has been strongest that the manufac-
turer is always an evil-minded person, who wants
to live by subsidies, by aids and steals, and by
exploiting his fellows to their disadvantage. Now
at all times the simplest, handiest, and least
noticeable device whereby an industry can be
“coddled” is by carrying its goods below cost,
and at a cheaper rate than other goods, on
the railways. And, looking at last year’s N.S.W.
railway report (page 9), these remarkable figures
obtrude themselves: —
Average rate

tons for one

Hay, Straw, Chaff .. 116,117 £0 3 2
Grain and Flour (from the
country to the coast, but

~'WesLr'".. .. 74,096 16" o
All other goods, including
most manufactured
goods 202,754 1 12 2
These figures distinctly represent the farmer as
the parasite—if there is a parasite—not the manu-
facturer. And it may be mentioned that the
farmer doesn’t get his rebate because his stuff goes
an extra long distance ; the longest average haul-
ages are on wool and live stock—the shortest on
coal. Nor are his hay, corn and chaff carried for
next tonothing because there isalargetradeiri these
things; they constitute the smallest item, save one,
on the list. Next to the farmer, as “ coddled ” and
“subsidised” persons, come other producers of
raw materials, and persons who dig out the “great
natural resources of the country ” to send them
away in trucks. The country pays secret bonuses
to these people to a huge extent yearly by making
up the railway deficit, and helps them in many
other ways besides. And seeing that the Free-
trader never, by any chance, denounces the farmer
as a robber, a cormorant, and a person who wants
to be “ coddled ” and to live on the industry of
others, and yet aims all these and worse epithets
at the much-less-liberally-assisted manufacturer, it
becomes reasonably obvious that it isn’t parasites
but manufactures which the importers’ party
desires to suppress. Only the other day it almost
seemed as if Sheol had broken loose because an
Australian manufacturing industry—the Lithgow
Iron Works—was receiving a railway rebate,
though it turned out to be a much smaller rebate
than the farmer enjoys. And if Sheol didn’t break
loose altogether, it was probably because the
Lithgow Iron Works are not very prosperous at
present, and the importers’ party reckons that
they may be dead in course of time. To accelerate
their deadness a Sydney morning paper published
a leading article in which it denounced the
reduced rate charged to Lithgow as a case of “the
taxpayers, through the railway department, sub-
sidising the works to the extent of about £9OOO a
year in freight concessions.” In 1904, the hay and
chaff business was worth to the N.S.W. railways
only £34,787, and as compared with the wool busi-
ness this microscopic industry was subsidised to
the extent of about £140,000; as compared with
miscellaneous manufactured goods it was subsi-
dised to the extent of over £340,000. It was even
heavily subsidised as compared with Lithgow
rates. The Freetrade party sees nothing dis-
creditable or parasitic in this—neither does
The Bulletin. But because the Freetrade or
importing crowd professes to see something utterly
disgraceful and ruinous in a much smaller aid to a
manufacturing industry, which pays better wages
and works its employees shorter hours, the Free-
trade and importing party stands forth con-
spicuously as one which is hostile to Australian
factories, and would resort to any slander to crush
them out of existence.
■* ■* * *
But there is one thing to be said for the
Australian Freetrader. He is generally ready to
speak kindly even of an Australian manufacturing
industry—if it is owned by foreigners. Only last
week Sydney Telegraph and S.M. Herald both
enthused over an English co. which, so rumor has
it, proposes to start shale and oil works at Capertee
(N.S.W.), provided it gets a further reduction on
the very low railway rates already charged. The
Herald was also excited over a proposed foreign
company which is thinking of canning rabbits at
Forbes, and which will also, probably, want a re-
bate. And though it didn’t say a single good word
about the desirability of helping or encouraging
any Australian-owned manufacture, the Herald
almost wept with pathos in that same article
about the things that would happen if foreign
papital “were to pour in” and start foreign-
owned industries. Further, by way of doing
strict justice to the Freetrader and the importers’
jackal, it must be admitted (a point which was
nearly overlooked) that the locally-owned and
enormously-protected beer industry appears sacred
from their attacks. There is no visible reason for
this, but they never call Tooth a cormorant or
a robber, and they don’t even allude to Toohey as
a subsidised and coddled parasite who lives on the
toil and substance of others. The subsidised or
protected iron, steel, woollen, cotton or agricul-
tural implement business is unspeakably objec-
tionable in the Freetrader’s eyes, and he foamed
with rage about the very small Brotection (4s. per
gallon) formerly given to Joshua Brothers’
Melbourne distillery ; but the subsidised farmer
is the backbone of the country, and against the
protected beer-maker not a voice is raised.
Berhaps a careful inspection of the lists of
brewery shareholders would throw some light on
this anomaly.
THE ANGLO-JAPANESE TREATY.
Within two years or less the British Government
will be called upon to decide as to the renewal or
termination of its alliance with Japan. There is
not the shadow of a doubt as to the direction of that
decision. When Britain, whose traditional policy
in Europe had been for years an attitude of
“splendid isolation/’ affecting to scorn friendships
as “entanglements,” first departed from that
policy to become the ally of an Asiatic Bower,
there were grave doubts in the minds of many as
to the wisdom of abandoning what had passed as
a fixed principle ; in the minds of many others as
to making the first exception in favor, not of a
European but an Asiatic people. But though
those doubts have probably not been removed (the
arguments on which they were founded have
been in no way affected) the liberty to
entertain them has departed from the Britisher.
Japan has fought its way to so high a
position, that Britain—the Britain of present-day
conditions —cannot afford to do without its Asiatic
friend. Britain, because of Cobdenism, is alone
among the great civilised Powers in not being
able to feed itself, and must gather its bread from
the waters. Any war, therefore, that so much as
seriously threatened its mastery of the seas would
mean annihilation. For the same reason of Cob-
denism, Britain has become a land without a
yeomanry, the citizens of which, to an extent
greater than in any other land, are without the
capacity to fight for their homes, and without the
national spirit to face a universal militia system.
Britain, therefore, dare not risk a great war with
the Mikado hostile or neutral. To a very large
extent, Japan owes its present power to Britain’s
aid. Had it not been for British moral sup-
port, the military and naval power of Nippon,
after its first startling display in the Chinese
war, would have been checked by a European
coalition. But, however much Japan leaned on
Britain a decade ago, or five years ago, there is little
dependence now. By the best of all tests Japan
has attained to the dignity of being counted a
war-Power, to which, on land at all events, Britain
must confess equality—if not something else.
He * * *
When Britain accepted Japan as an ally it
was—according to general belief—after Japan had
received a humiliating rebuff in making a similar
request to Russia. Certainly at that time the
Asiatic country was in the position of a suitor,
and an uncertain suitor at that. But when, a
little while hence, Japan discusses the ques-
tion of having Britain as an ally for a future
term of years, it will be in London and
not in Tokio that there will be nervous
fears of a hitch. That Britain might, by a
giant effort, re-assert its old splendor and dare
again a policy of splendid isolation is, of course,
true. In that case London would not have to
wait on Tokio. But there is no practical use in
discussing what might be. What is—that alone
matters. And that shows Britain still wedded to
Freetrade, still dependent on the ocean for its
food, still without a citizen army and with no
indications of any resolution to reform. Under
such conditions Britain needs Japan, must have
the Japanese alliance as the price of national
security. If such an alliance were not entered
into, probably there would be other suitors for the
friendship of the powerful Yellow Man. Though
no other European people would in the past assist
Japan to become a Power, now that it is
a Power few would despise its alliance.
With Japan an enemy, Britain would almost find
its Asiatic possessions in danger, and in the
event of a general European war would have one
of its food-routes blocked. So the Britain of to-
day must have Japan as an ally. It has played a
Frankenstein freak in nation-politics by bringing
the Yellow Man to sit at the European council
table, and part of the price is a certain measure of
dependence on the monster it has created.
m * * *
Tokio knows that as well as London. Behind
the slant eyes of the Mongolian are brains as good
in the matter of diplomacy as any in Caucasian
skulls. As to whether the Jap is the super-man
of the daily press, a marvel of intellectual and
physical pre-eminence, the world, in spite of some
recent events, still entertains occasional doubts.
But certainly the Mikado’s men are not wanting in
appreciation of their own exploits, and are not dis-
posed to under-estimate their future. Therefore
London must expect to pay for the renewal of an
alliance, which is, under present conditions,
necessary, and only to be made unnecessary by a
national regeneration and re-organisation, as to
the beginning of which there is no sign. And
what London pays is of vital importance to Aus-
tralia, since it may be that Australia is put in the
pool when the bargain is being made. A harassed
Roman empire was willing, centuries ago, to leave
its colonies in Britain to be overwhelmed by the
barbarians because the legions were wanted in
Rome. A harassed British empire might one
day be prepared to secure its own safety
with the sacrifice of Australia. Already it is
suggested by one British newspaper, pro-
fessedly “on official authority,” that if Japan
were allowed to colonise Australia, then “Great
Britain and Japan might dominate the world
together,” and from another source comes the
intelligence that one of the first subjects to engage
the attention of the Mikado after the conclusion
of the war with Russia will be the exclusion of his
subjects from Australia, and a threatening demon-
stration by Admiral Togo’s fleet in these waters is
hinted at. Rumor speaks often with a lying
tongue, but a persistent rumor generally has some
foundation of truth, and there are many good
grounds of reason why we should believe that
there is some threat to the Commonwealth in the
growth of Japan’s might.
* * * *
The Australian territory, ever since it was
opened up by the white man, has been a sort of
El Dorado to the Asiatic. The earliest struggles
of this land were against a Chinese invasion, and
the Japanese, no doubt, would like to find an
outlet for their surplus population, if not a
dependency of the Empire they are building up,
in _ Australia. There is a further essentially
Oriental reason why Japan should exercise a new-
born power to strive to humble Australia. The
policy of excluding Asiatics from our territory has
undoubtedly given serious offence, and, even if
there were no material advantage in “taking it
out of Australia,” probably Japan would make
that a. dear object nevertheless. The Oriental
mind is astonishingly servile when oppressed, and
just as insolent when in power. For many, many
years the Asiatic has suffered under the
scorn of the European. Now Japan has set
itself the task of balancing the account. It
is, therefore, quite possible—almost probable—
that when the next treaty of alliance be-
tween Britain and Japan comes to be dis-
cussed, there will he conditions proposed
by Japan seriously affecting this country’s
interests. Australia must set its mind now to
seriously discuss that emergency. If Japan asks
and Britain grants concessions which interfere
with our Australian self-government and our
white-race ideals, what will be the answer of
Australia ?
* # * *
If it is a meek acquiescence, it will involve the
abandonment for ever of the idea of Australian
nationalism, of the dream of holding this island
fortress as a home, perhaps as a refuge, for the
white race. Should Australia consent to sacrifice
its self-government at the bidding of Japan, as it
had never yet done at the bidding of Britain, the
cherishing of national ideals would be absurd,
and we Australians might as well begin to resign
ourselves to finally becoming mean whites, hanging
to the heels of an Asiatic satrapy. Yet a refusal
would be the gravest of all actions. According to the
present temper of British rulers, if Australia were
set in the balance on one side and the friendship of
Japan on the other, Australia would kick the
beam. To refuse to be a pawn given away to
Japan in the war game might involve Australia in
a fight for its existence. If we had our gun fac-
tories, our iron mills and ship-building yards, our
own navy, our manhood trained to the last unit to
carry arms, there would be no reason to face that
prospect with anything but equanimity and forti-
tude. A white race capable of any sort of defence
would not be permitted to be smothered by Asia.
But Australia, as it is now, without even an
ammunition factory, would inevitably perish, going
to its grave shrouded in the calico, the worship of
which brought it to its ruin. It is not, however,
too late, even now at the eleventh hour, to start to
prepare. But the Event knocks at the door.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Butter Commission’s Report.
The final report of the Butter Commission is as
comprehensive and almost as drastic as the subject
demanded—also it is so Socialistic in its recom-
mendations that the wonder is that Premier Bent
and his friends have not ordered it to be burned
by the hangman. The Commission was composed
of a public servant, as chairman, and two strict
anti-Socialists— Henry Gyles Turner, late of the
Commercial Bank, and George Graham, M.L.A.
and farmer. Put briefly, it recommends that laws
be enacted putting the whole butter industry
under control of the State, through a Board to be
appointed. This Board would license all factories,
refuse licenses where factories are unnecessary,
cancel licenses where conditions and regulations
are not complied with, appoint supervisors over
factories and creameries, certify as to the compe-
tence of factory managers, &c., take over at a
valuation private factories for the benefit of the
suppliers, inspect balance-sheets, and call
for any returns it might think fit, prohibit
imitations and adulterations, insist on all
boxes, packages, &c., being correctly branded
with net weights ; insist on all milled or
blended butter being branded and sold as
“renovated butter”; inspect and pass, from a
sanitary point of view, all factories, creameries,
etc.; fix a standard for butter—said standard to
be not less than 80 per cent, of butter fat nor
more than 15 per cent, of moisture; administer
the Health Act as regards butter factories, etc,;
see that all butter for export is consigned to the
Government Cool Stores and is there graded by
Government experts, who shall further advise the
manufacturer as to any defects. If these recom-
mendations were fully carried out they would prac-
tically put the whole of the butter industry, from
its starting point at the under surface of the cow
right to the ship’s hold, under the direct control
of the State Export Department —which is a
pretty considerable instalment of Socialism.
The Commission further demands Federal
legislation as to standardising weights, con-
trolling brands and compelling the tricky
trader to put 16 ounces in his lib.
tins, etc. ; but the States will have to
take control of the primary and minor details of
the industry. The report, incidentally, points
out that, of the £103,599 paid by the State as a
butter export bonus, nearly half went into the
pockets of the agents; and that the whole
“ private enterprise ” system is rotten, inasmuch
as secret commissions, rebates, and direct bribes
have been given to factory managers, directors,
and contractors for supplies, &c., thus ruining the
honest dealer or manufacturer, and inducing a
system of trickery and roguery. Also it tells Pre-
mier Bent that the facts disclosed in the evidence
about the Victoria Creamery and Butter Co. anc.
the Fresh Food and Frozen Storage Co.—it
specially names seven commercial men in this con-
nection —should be brought under the notice of the
Crown Law authorities. Altogether it is a sudden
and refreshingly honest report, and, as neither
Bent, Carruthers, nor the two_ half-Premiers are
likely to take much action on it unless someone
prods them violently from the rear, it may be
advantageously pointed out to the dairy-farmer
generally—and to him of Victoria in particular—
that a large sum of money has been spent, much
hard work has been done, and a great de jv »
obloquy has been incurred by Australia m general,
for his benefit and advantage, and chiefly because
he would not take the straight and sensible roaa
that was pointed out to him when he started
butter exporting; and if he fails to force these
dilatory Ministers to push the Commission s work
to its logical conclusion, and prefers to continue
denouncing Socialism, this country will probably
take him at his word, and his last case will 6
worse than his first. And he won’t be the only
sufferer, by any means; the wheat-grower and
the orchardist are being exploited nearly as rutn-
lessly as the dairy-farmer.

Salvation by Polysyllables.
Brisbane Worker, which, one way and another,
continues to add to the difficulties of the " a .°£
party, and is frequently quoted with great glee
by its enemies, has lately had another viole
attack of “sinking the fiscal issue Senator
Stewart wrote to protest against the absurd
of being a political ostrich, and pretending to sink
something that can’t be sunk, and never is sunk ,
and the Worker replied in two columns ot poi)


syllables, of which the conclusion was that the
only hope for the world is through “ the growth
of class-consciousness towards a revolutionary
change in the basis of society.” The Bulletin
doesn’t know for sure what this farrago means,
but it does know for sure that Walker’s foundry
at Maryborough employed 1000 hands a few years
ago, under the comparatively high Queensland
State Protective tariff, whereas it employs only
125 now, under the Federal tariff, which G. H.
Reid and other Freetraders whittled away until
it gave no Protection worth mentioning. Yet
Australia has needed the things that Walker’s
foundry could supply; but, instead of getting
them from Maryborough, it has got them from
Belgium, Brummagem, or elsewhere ; instead of
putting wages into the pockets of Queensland
-rtisans, it has sent the money off to the foreigner,
and thereby thrown 875 Queenslanders out of a
job. And the Queensland artisan, crying for a
crust, is offered a quantity of long words. His
children, asking for food, are told not to be so
stupid, but to feed on the hope of “the growth
of class-consciousness towards a revolutionary
change in the basis of society.” What will happen
to them while the class-consciousness is growing
to edible size isn’t explained. The same beautiful
words of six syllables have been filling the same
weary columns for many years, and, presumably,
class-consciousness has been growing. But what
advantage has it been to the blacksmiths, the
foundrymen, the laborers who have been thrown
out of a job because the tariff isn’t high enough to
shut out the products of the cheap-labor foreigner?
As a matter of fact, the growth of class-conscious-
ness has, in many cases, simply made matters
worse for the Australian workman ; instead of fill-
ing his cupboard, it has emptied it ; instead of
warmly clothing his children, it has turned them out
in rags. For the trouble has been that, though there
has been a growth of class-consciousness here,
the blessed thing hasn't budged an inch in some
other places. While it has secured for the Aus-
tralian workman an eight-hour day, the Chinese
and the Jap still work 12 hours a day. While it
has, through the Arbitration Courts, obtained for
the Australian workmen an order that they shall
be paid, say, 9s. a day, it hasn’t stopped the
foreign employer getting the same class of work-
men for ss. a day. Class-consciousness has grown
so much in Australia that the workman isn’t
permitted, so to speak, to go more than three
miles an hour. But the foreign workman is
prodded till he goes six miles an hour ; and then
the Worker expects the Australian workman to
arrive at the same time as his rival. Of course he
doesn’t do anything of the sort; the foreigner gets
there first, empties the cupboard, and leaves
nothing but the sack and a number of polysyl-
lables for the Australian. The Worker’s beautiful
theory might pan out all right if the growth it
talks about were a uniform thing. If it would
leave off preaching in Australia, and transport
itself to China, and water the plant there, and
grow class-consciousness on the banks of the
Hoang-ho until Sing Fat would scorn to take less
than Bs. 4d. a day of eight hours; and if it then
brought every foreign country up to the level of
Australia in the matter of hours and conditions of
work, it might sink the fiscal issue. But so long
as the foreigner will work for less wages, or under
worse conditions, than the Australian, by consent-
ing to Freetrade the Worker simply drags the
Australian down to the conditions of the country
where there is least of that class-consciousness that
it talks about.
What the Freetrader is Thankful For.
Official figures for the Commonwealth, now
issued by N.S.W. Acting-Statist Hall, knock a
rather large hole in some statistics lately supplied
by the German Consulate relating to German
trade with Australasia; likewise, they knock a
somewhat larger hole in some elaborate Freetrade
arguments built upon the ricketty foundations of
the Consulate’s figures. These latter stated Aus-
tralasian exports to Germany for 1903 at
£6,001,050; imports, £2,238,000; excess of Aus-
tralasian exports over imports, £3,763,050. The
official Commonwealth statistics, however, show
that the Australian imports from Germany
amounted to £2,358,553, and the exports to
£3,134,638. A very small part of the £2,866,412
by which the two sets of export figures differ is
accounted for by Maoriland exports-; by far ther
greater part is made up of freight, &c., from Aus-
tralia to Germany, from which, of course, Aus-
tralia derives no advantage whatever. Most of
the exports consist of bulky products, practically
all of them raw articles, such as ores and concen-
trates, wools, hides, fat, &c., upon -which the
freight is exceedingly high in proportion to the
value of the goods. The S.M. Herald, waiting
when the German figures were published, pointed
to them as proof that Australia was doing very
nicely and needn’t worry itself about “ hot-house ”
manufactures; also that the British manufacturer
needn’t worry either. “ The balance of £3,763,050
is placed to our credit in London to pay for British
goods or for other purposes. ... If this trade
with Germany were not done, we should have
£3,763,050 less to spend among British
manufacturers.” And now we find that tb s
balance of £3,763,050 is largely a myth and
the Herald’s argument largely mud. But even
if it weren’t, what a contemptible attitude for
an Australian paper to take up to rejoice
in the exportation of millions of pounds’ worth of
skins, and crude ore. and raw wool (much of it
without even the dirt washed off it), and to be
glad over the fact that some foreign manufacturer
will send us goods for the money ! Our black
brother Bill knocks over the rabbit with his
stick and trades off the skin for tobacco. We are
the black brother Bill among the nations,
knocking over rabbits, cutting off the sheep’s
wool and crowding it into a bag without washing
it, rooting up the minerals and not even smelting
them, leaving all the jobs that keep highly
civilised nations employed for other nations to do,
content ourselves with merely banging the rodent
and rooting stones out of the ground. These are the
victories of Freetrade, and the Herald rejoices
over them, and is devoutly thankful that we can
keep “the British manufacturer” so well em-
ployed. As for the Australian manufacturer and
the Australian artisan—isn’t there the swift
rabbit to pursue, and the stupid sheep to shear,
and the tree to chop down, and the stone to dig
up, and what more can they want ?
A Little Far-off Revolution.
A certain interest attaches in a small way to the
fact that Norway has sent a post-card to Sweden,
explaining that it has set up for itself, that it has
no further use for the present monarch, who can,
therefore, have a rest, and that the joint kingdom
of Sweden and Norway has gone out of business.
Norway, which used to be the stormy petrel of
Europe, has been a very quiet place in recent cen-
turies. It burst its boiler with over-exertion
when very young, A thousand years or so ago
its people, in addition to running a pretty regular
civil war, raged with their long ships and their
long swords all round the Atlantic and beyond it.
They owned the Orkneys and Shetlands, the
Hebrides, Iceland, and the Isle of Man. They
pervaded part of the coast of North America, and
argued with the natives of those parts, and they
howled up and down the Mediterranean. For 200
years they were the maddest and drunkest fighters
on earth, and stole nearly everything that wasn’t
nailed down, and burned nearly everything that
wasn’t wet, from Greenland to Constantinople.
Then their star pegged out. The last Norse king
who invaded England— Harold “ Hard-Coun-
sel”—was defeated and killed at Stamford in
1066. Magnus “ Barefoot,” the last one who
invaded Ireland, left his bones and his large bare
feet there among the native Home Rulers in 1103.
Haco tried to annex Scotland later on, and died in
the course of his retreat after the disastrous battle
of Largs; and then Norway settled down to fishing,
and petty civil wars, and the growth of large snow-
balls. After a while it grew too tired for civil
war and only fished. The Danes got possession of
the country about 1380, through a confused series of
royal marriages, and ran things in a high-handed
way till 1814, when Europe was cleaning up after
the” Napoleonic wars, and then Norway was in-
formed that it was to become Swedish property. It
kicked a little, but it wasn’t the kick of Harold
“Hard-Counsel,” nor even of Magnus “Bare-
foot” and the transfer came off. Still things drifted
along easily. Norway had its own Parliament
and universal suffrage. It had its own tariff. It
didn’t even allow the king to veto its laws. It
abolished titles of nobility. It had its own army,
and its own navy of four ironclads and a raft and
some sundries, and it had its own Ibsen. But
the aristocratic Swede had a superior habit of
patting Norway on the back, and telling it to be
good and go to bed early, and somehow the union
was never popular. There was hardly a public-
house in any seaport on earth where one flaxen-
haired sailor could casually mention “Sweden and
Norway ” without another flaxen-haired seaman
yelling “Norway and Sweden,” and over that
question pewter beer-pots have been wrecked in
Valparaiso and Colon and New York and Odessa
and even up the Persian Gulf. Now, quite
suddenly, King Oscar has been dismissed without
even a week’s salary in advance, and if Sweden
doesn’t think the matter worth fighting about the
old arrangement is off. Norway starts business
as a kingdom 1160 miles long and in some places
only 20 miles wide, and with a tail at the north,
which tail sticks into Russia in an unaccountable
fashion. Also, it has 2j; million people, and
Kaiser William of Germany is understood to
have his eye on it. But then there are few things
on earth that Kaiser William hasn’t his eye upon,
and few people to whom he hasn’t sent a telegram.
Still Another Land Bill.
The newest scheme of N.S.W. Lands Minister
Ashton for “coddling” and assisting the farmer
is a rather curious affair. It is a mixture of a
Closer Settlement scheme and a State Land Bank
device, and the Minister describes it thus :
Take an example such as this : A large estate is owned
by A, who desires to subdivide it. He finds a sufficient
number of farmers, who are ready to purchase the estate
from him in small areas. A provisional agreement is
entered into between the vendor and the purchasers, and
a plan of subdivision is submitted to the Government
authority, whom, for the present, we may call the Com-
missioners. The owner asks, we will say, £3 an acre for
the land. The purchasers are in a position to find, say,
one-third of the purchase-money. The Commissioners,
provided they approve of the valuation submitted to
them, agree to advance the other two-thirds of the pur-
chase money. The vendor falls out of the transaction,
being paid one-third by the private purchasers and two-
thirds by the Commissioners, and the Government there-
after stands to the new settlers in the relation of mort-
gagee.
Then being asked how it was proposed to prevent
land thus cut up from aggregating into large
estates again, Minister Ashton explained :
That could be effectually guarded against, I think, by
giving the Commissioners power to approve or disapprove
of transfers of the equity of redemption, and power to
regulate the area which might be acquired by any indivi-
dual person by fixing a maximum to the advance that
might be made to any one settler.
There is something curiously futile about all this
business, but in that respect it is of a piece with
the general half-heartedness, unfinishedness and
compromise of the Carruthers Ministry. On at
least three points it appears fairly justifiable to
call the new—or allegedly new—lands device a
very poor apology for the thing that is really re-
quired :
(1) It puts no compulsion on the owner of the large
estate which blocks settlement. He isn’t directly com-
pelled to sell by a resumption process, nor indirectly com-
pelled by a graduated land-tax. Ever since big estates
began to block settlement, the owners have been abso-
lutely at liberty to sell if they wanted to. The Car-
ruthers Closer Settlement Act also allows them to sell if
they want to. The whole difficulty has lain in them not
wanting to.
(2) If the big owner wants to sell (which he generally
doesn’t), and the small man wants to buy, and the price
is satisfactory to both of them and to the Government
valuer, the State is to advance two-thirds of the money.
This is set forth as if it were a bright, fresh device, the
glitter of which would shine like a new pannikin by
moonlight. Yet Maoriland, Victoria, and S.A. have State
Land Banks which do just this kind of business ; and
N.S. \V. is supposed to have, somewhere or other, the
ruins or vestiges of a somewhat similar institution,
though it is a concern about which it is practically
impossible to get any information of value. Also the
Savings Bank does the same kind of work. Minister
Ashton’s proposal is, therefore, something like this :
N.S.W. has one State Land Bank, which seems to be
about dead. The Carruthers Government promises to
start a second, before the first one is cleaned up, by amal-
gamation of the Savings Banks. And seemingly the
Lands Department is going to found a third.
(3) Finally, the new proposal doesn’t seem to be any
definite Closer Settlement scheme at all. At least, there
is nothing said about any guarantee that the man who
buys, with the aid of the State, say 300 acres of a
large property that is being broken up, won’t also be, at
the same time, the owner of large areas elsewhere. The
new system may limit the amount it will lend to one man,
but that won’t prevent him being already an extensive
landow'ner, who is simply grabbing with the State’s
assistance a few' extra acres. The new system may also put
some kind of restriction on transfers while the mortgage
lasts, but again it may not; the matter is apparently to
be left to the discretion of the Commissioners. Certainly
it can do nothing to prevent the-re-aggregation of large
estates as soon as the mortgages are paid off. When they
are paid off the control of the Commissioners comes to an
end.
In short, until there is a heavy graduated land-
tax to make the holding or acquiring of large
estates unprofitable, all Closer Settlement schemes
are likely to be little more than sham and orna-
ment. They may have a temporary effect, but
nothing more. And all schemes for breaking up
the great estates that block settlement in the
coastal districts, so long as these schemes start
with the proviso that the owner may sell if he
feels so inclined, amount to very little. The
owner has always been at liberty to sell if he felt
inclined. He hasn’t sold because he didn’t feel
inclined. And there is only one reason why
State interference on the voluntary principle
should fill him with a voluntary inclination to sell
which he otherwise wouldn’t feel—that he hopes
to get more from the State than the land is worth.
If the State is willing to allow itself to be swin-
dled, then it may obviously, on the Ashton and
Carruthers principle, do a good deal of Closer
Settlement, though what it does will probably
be undone in future years. The State covered
Monaro years ago with small settlers who are gone
now almost to the last man—the squatting octopus
having devoured them.
«
The N.S.W. Arbitration Act.
The S. Australian election results should add some
weight to the protest of the N.S.W. Labor party
against the strangling of th 3 Arbitration Act.
Presuming any regard on Premier Carruthers’
part for the duties and responsibilities of his posi-
tion no such adventitious aid would be required ;
but, as his attitude is always moulded by oppor-
tunism. the reinforcement will not be needless.
It is not much of an argument with Carruthers
that an action is improper ; but if he can be con-
vinced that it is dangerous, he is at once influenced.
The S. Australia results show that there is
no virtue in Reid’s clowning to stem the tide
of Progress. The newly-elected leader and latest
pride of the Tories recently went to S. Australia to
preach the evangel of “ anti-Soeialism.” The
Tory leaders and newspapers there accepted his
lead and gave to the local Labor party the bogey
name of “Socialist,” though Price is probably
the most moderate and the least Socialistic of all
the Labor leaders. The issue was thus made one
of Socialism, as represented by the Labor party,
versus anti-Socialism, as represented by the hotch-
Eotch of Tories, Tory-Liberals, Liberal-Tories,
liberal - Conservatives, Progressive - Backsliders,
Yes-Noes, and politicians who walk crab-fashion.
And what the Tories defined as Socialism
scored most emphatically. It is the first electoral
judgment on Reid’s anti-Socialism campaign, and
it is so convincing as to make justifiable a forecast
of his utter defeat at any Federal general election.
It is, further, another proof that in State politics
Labor is a constantly advancing force. With
all its mistakes and its failures to grapple
obvious opportunities, the Labor party, as
compared with the other old parties, shines
brightly, and the electors see and follow
the light. Another election in N.S. Wales,
according to the hint given by S. Australia, would
put the Labor party into power, and in the present
Parliament that party has sufficient strength to
force an election almost whenever it chooses. So
there is very good reason for Carruthers to re-
consider his determination to destroy, by under-
hand means, the Arbitration Act. He must see
that it will be cheaper for him to part company
with his John Stinson following than to utterly
antagonise the Labor party. By falling in with
Reid’s anti-Socialism humbug, he is making his
own destruction sure, whilst, even if he lent his
shred of assistance to wipe Reid out of Federal
politics, a Eederally-unemployed Reid, who badly
wanted to recover his old State job, would be,
though a source of danger, not exactly certain ex-
tinction. Carruthers’ political success so far has
depended upon his capacity for seeing a hole—the
hole to get into and the hole to get out of. Very
little perception will show him now that in bowing
to the John Stinson ukase to smother the
Arbitration Act he has got into the wrong hole.
Even the Daily Telegraph tells him that.

An Unnecessary Adjective.
That “imported ” and “ shoddy ” are practically
the same adjective, is the lesson which almost
every witness before the Tariff Commission im-
presses. At last Wednesday week’s sitting:—
Mr. Robert Vicars, manufacturer, sworn : The Aus-
tralian wool blanket practically supplanted the other
blankets, except those of Maoriland, in the higher quali-
ties. The lower-grade blankets are imported. . . . The
local trade in genuine tweeds had been “smothered” by
the importation of shoddy cloth. . . . The history of the
decline of the local article began, he believed, when sam-
ples of Australian tweed were sent to England for the
special purpose of being copied in cheaper imitations.
We had to come down in price to compete with this
article, and -we have been down ever since.
John Blackman, manufacturer’s agent, sworn: The
great trouble was that when an article was produced
locally, patterns were forwarded immediately to English
buyers, and copies came out—very good imitations these
were, but they had not the wearing qualities of the stuff
made here. . . . When his mills took up the manufacture
of flannels the quality of the article produced was so good
that one warehouse firm offered to take the supply for
three years ; but patterns of the flannels were sent to
England and to Victoria, with the result that imitations
appeared here, and his mills had to abandon the trade.
He was a Freetrader himself, but under Freetrade the
mills did poorly, and were gradually closing up.
That is from the evidence of one day, and is typi-
cal of the evidence of many days. The story is
always the same. The local manufacturer can
produce a good honest article at a fair price, does
so, and is smothered by a flood of shoddy imitations
which a defective tariff allows in to compete
against him. “Imported ” means “shoddy ” and
“shoddy” means “imported.” Since the man
who makes only one adjective to grow where two
flourished before is a benefactor to his language,
The Bulletin suggests dropping “shoddy” as a
word. “ Imported ” carries its whole meaning.

England Ltd.
Stonehenge, where the pre-historic Briton used
to worship the sun on the occasions of its rare
visits to his island, has, by judicial decision, been
closed to the British public. Stonehenge is part
of the nation, one of the few certain monuments
of the people who gave the British Isles their
name, and who showed themselves such sturdy
fighters against the Roman arms and such apt
pupils of the Roman civilisation. But the owner
of the ground on which it stands can barbed-wire-
fence it and charge the Britisher a pound a head
to gaze upon the altar of his race tradition. The
decision is a notable landmark in the descent
of England towards the ultimate ideal of Private
Property, when Commerce will be the one God,
and the British infant will be charged so much for
the privilege of beingborn in his own country—pay-
ment strictly in advance. Centuries ago, Shak-
speare put into the mouth of John o’ Gaunt, the
scorn :
—England, bound in by the triumphant seas,
Whose rocky shores beat back the envious siege of watery
Neptune,
Is now hound in with shame with inky blots and rotten
parchment bonds.
Whatever truth there was in the invective then,
there is much now. Britain for many years
has set its face away from idealism and towards
commercialism. On the altar of Cobden it
sacrificed the yeomanry, who “once had been
their country’s pride,” and gave over its memoried
acres to be the playgrounds of American million-
aires and Jewish plutocrats. Scotland now, for
miles and miles, is wire-fenced and stone-walled to
serve the whimful pleasure of the foreign rich.
That they may shoot, the Scotch peasants had to
emigrate. Historic England falls quickly to the
same fate, and the date when Westminster
Abbey will be put up for auction in New York or
Tokio might almost be fixed. The declaration
which makes Stonehenge private property is not
an isolated fact; it is one of many, all pointing to
the same moral, that the Britisher is losing his
pride of race and country, that in the chase for a
concession in Asia or a gold mine in Africa he has
lost the faculty to think of his own hearth. Soon
he will be leading “an hotel life” among the
nations.
A. L. Harrold, formerly head of the one-time
great firm of Harrold Bros., which came to a
smash that dragged him out of the S. Aus.
Assembly and landed him somewhere else, has
gone to England to push on a scheme in connec-
tion with the overland-railway land-grab. The
Jenkins-Butler crowd hasn’t missed many
chances lately of giving the northern elephant a
push along; it has been scattering literature
wholesale (pro-yellow literature, much of it), and
Jenkins, before he crept into the nice, dry office
of Agent-General, dotted most of his speeches
with remarks upon the necessity of mongrelising
Australia. Now “Geology” Brown is up there
to report on another branch of the Territory’s
“ great natural resources.” What Brown has to say
on the labor question isn’t likely, though, to help
on the treachery very much. When the yellow
man has worked the N.T. mines “on his own”
he has simply rooted out the easily-worked gold,
and made it almost impossible for anybody else to
go in after him; and when he has been an
employee for English or Australian co.’s the end
has always been disaster. It is a hard fact for the
cheap yellow-labor crowd to think over that the one
part of Australia where mining has been a dismal
failure is also the one part where abundance of
tbis cheap yellow labor has been available all the
time. It is also a hard fact that, with a far
greater proportion of Asiatics than any other
part—the proportion runs to four Asiatics to one
European—the N.T. is the one part that has made
no progress whatever in any direction. Spruce
Myth and the rest of them, who tell Australia
that the way to get jolly and fat is to let in the
Asiatic or any other colored person, ought to be
invited to explain how it is that the N.T., with its
four Asiatics to every one European, and with its
alleged enormous natural resources to work on,
has heen simply a drag on the State that has to
carry it —has a huge deficit —can’t even collect
enough revenue to pay interest—and hasn’t one-
third the white population that it used to have
before the flood of colored laborers arrived.
So far the statements laid before the N.S.W.
Lands Inquiry Commission regarding Nicholas
Willis’ brother-in-law may be condensed as fol-
lows : —He is, or was, a letter-carrier at Granville—
just a plain, mild, harmless letter-carrier. There
were a number of applications for the lease of
certain lands, and the tender of the letter-carrier
was the lowest. The Board recommended that
the highest tender should be accepted. Instead,
Willis’ brother-in-law, the letter-carrier, was in-
formed of the amount of the highest tender, and
told that if he liked to raise his offer to that figure
he could have the land. This was said to be because
he was the “original applicant, ’’ which apparently
he wasn't. The letter-carrier raised his offer, and
got the land. About four months afterwards
the letter-carrier applied for a reduction
of rent, and got it; his rent was reduced
from an average of about per acre to 41d.
Consequently the increased offer, whereby the
applicant got the land, was hardly any sooner
increased than it was reduced again. The letter-
carrier, it is said, never even saw the land, and
never went near it. It seems to have been
promptly mortgaged to the Willis family, which
foreclosed on it. The commission called the letter-
carrier as a witness last week, but he didn’t turn
up. As the Sydney dailies enthusiastically put
it : “We must settle the people on the land,” and
certainly it appears that something has been done
that way. The success achieved in settling
Nicholas Willis on the land seems to have been
almost phenomenal.
Queensland Treasurer Kidston is accused of
fathering the agitation to form a new Labor party
with a “moderate democratic” platform. The
trouble has arisen over the Crown land sales
which the Morgan Government is persisting in.
Undoubtedly there is a split, a new central
organisation having been formed, in addition
to several provincial ones. If the scheme goes
on to successful accomplishment, it is calculated
that the members of the present Labor party
likely to go over will give Morgan a majority
of about eight in the event of a split. The more
radical Labor members complain bitterly that a
g reference to unionists clause is not contained in the
lompulsory Arbitration Bill to be introduced next
session. The Bulletin would be sorry to see a
division which would send a most valuable section
of the Queensland Labor party into a camp where
Liberalism would be very much watered. A
“ Labor” party believing in the further alienation
of the people’s land and in an emasculated Arbi-
tration Act would be a very curious Labor party
indeed.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While the crippled cruisers stagger where the
blind horizon dips,
And the ocean ooze is rising round the sunken
battleships,
While the battered wrecks, unnoticed, with their
mangled crews, drift past—
Let me fire one gun for Russia, though that gun
should be the last.
’Tis a struggle of the Ages, and the White Man’s
star is dim,
There is little jubilation, for the game has got too
grim ;
But though Russia’s hope seems shattered, and
the Russian star seems set,
It may mean the Dawn for Russia —and my hope’s
in Ivan yet!
Let the Jingo, in his blindness, cant and cackle
as he will;
But across the path of Asia run the Russian
trenches still !
And the sahib in his rickshaw may 101 l back and
smoke at ease,
While the haggard, ragged heroes man the battered
batteries.
’Tis the first round of the struggle of the East
against the West,
Of the fearful war of races—for the White Man
could not rest.
Hold them, Ivan ! staggering bravely underneath
your gloomy sky;
Hold them, Ivan ! we shall want you pretty badly
by-and-bye !
Fighting for the Indian empire, when the British
pay their debt;
Never Briton watched for Blucher as he’ll watch
for Ivan yet !
It means all to young Australia—it means life or
death to us,
For the vanguard of the White Man is the van-
guard of the Russ!

Two years ago, when Mr. Edward Brans-
eombe’s Westminster Glee Party first showed
the quality of the voices that echo round the
bones in the great English charnel-house,
there were four men and four boys; now there
are six of one and seven of the other. But the
rare qualities of pure enunciation and true intona-
tion and nice balance have not been sacrificed to
volume. There isn’t anything particularly
striking in the way of solo-singing ; and there is no
bright and not very particular star who is deter-
mined to show the size and beauty of the bell in
his own throat or crack it in the attempt. General
Effect is aimed at; and the old warrior is
hit every time. Saturday night’s audience
at Sydney Town Hall was obviously a
congregation. It was even expected to
bring a thipny-bit to put on the plate
and get a programme in return. Most of them
brought the thripny from force of habit; but the
rest who thought they were going to a concert
kicked. Everybody had his revenge, however,
by encoring every number except one. It was
the best item on the programme, but apparently
was reckoned of too sacred a character for the
worldly encore, so the programme instructed the
congregation to receive it in silence. But, by the
way, why is it that part-singing should only,
these times, appeal to the congregation ? Fluff
and feathers will turn up at a concert where 27
mostly-bad solo numbers are listed ; but if part-
singing is mentioned the same crowd either doesn’t
go at all, or leaves off its frills and puts on
the same clothes that it goes to funerals in.
And (apart from the before-mentioned thripny-
bit) there isn’t anything particularly ecclesiastic
about the Gleesters’ performance, which, on the
whole, is much more cheerful than the concert
with the eight pianoforte solos and the 15 soulful
ballads. Of the newcomers, taking them
individually, basso Bennett proves the most
popular ; and soloist Madame Hooten uses her
contralto with the same good effect as hitherto.
Dudley Causton, of the old co., contributes his
humorous musical sketches to the new co., and
gets great applause—which only shows that the
Branscombe congregation doesn’t frequent Aus-
tralian music-halls. If it did it would have seen
a dozen other performers in this same played-out
line of mimic business, and it would have been
much less enthusiastic.

Nothing much has happened to “The
Oingalee ” this week except that it has been raised
individually and collectively to the dignity of
being carried through the post on a card for Id.
Nobody is truly great these times till Pumpkin
Smith carries him for that small sum in a post-bag ;
and the greatness has come to our brown fellow-
subject in his last week in Sydney. Meantime,
the tea-girl has been taking the moth-balls out of
her travelling clothes, and making sure that she has
enough hair-pins to see her through to Melbourne ;
and on Saturday night Mack will depose Boo-
bhambah at Her Majesty’s in Sydney, and Ireland
will reign for a short season of drama with musical
interruptions. “Tom Moore,” with which the
new season opens, is said to have been written
expressly for Andrew Mack, and The Bulletin
knows nothing to the contrary.

Miss Eugenie Duggan must find this world
in very truth a vale of tears. Next Saturday night
she will enact, at Sydney Palace, the part of that
dampest heroine, Lady Isabel-Madame Vine, in
“East Lynne.” But up to next Friday night all
those who love melodrama at its drammiest will
have opportunities to thrill over “ Two Little
Drummer Boys.”

An American humorist, Frank Pixley by
name (we don’t know him, but that’s no reason
why he isn’t a large buck-wheat cake in his own
country), wrote the libretto of “King Dodo,”
produced for the first time in Australia on Satur-
day night, at Sydney Criterion. Pixley may
have got a suggestion of his theme from a set of
verses called “Ponce de Leon,” which may be
found in most “ books of recitation for the
young.” In the poem a haughty Spaniard, who
had gone seafaring with Columbus in that eminent
navigator’s ferry-boat, is told by an Indian
slave of the wondrous land where the streets are
beaten gold, and where all the Beautiful Works
of Nature are more beautiful, having been greatly
improved upon since the time when Baby Genesis
was cutting his first tooth and amusing himself with
the serpent’s tail in Mesopotamia—long before he
grew up and became the father of Exodus
and that wild youth Deuteronomy. In the midst
of fragrant flowers and singing birds with jewel-
like plumage, there bubbles a spring, and whoso
shall drink its waters shall regain his lost youth
and live for ever. Ponce sets sail and runs up
against Florida. It is quite beautiful enough for
him, but his after - fate has nothing to do
with this gospel—nor with that of “King
Dodo,” according to Pixley. The humorist
puts “Dodo” in a gorgeous Florida background,
with palaces, and the iron gates that suggest
property worth stealing on the other side.
Spoojuland is the name of this phantom country,
and it is ruled by Queen Lilli, the most Gibson-
esque of all beautiful Amazons. She is white,
and dressed in superb, up-to-date raiment; but
her army is black, and its tailoring doesn’t cost
anything. To this fair land come King Dodo (the
very antithesis of the Spaniard) and his court to
hunt for the magic spring. No man knoweth to
what age, race or country the potentate belongs.
He wears, in crimson brocade, the stuffed
trunks and hose of Elizabethan days, and
a crown no bigger than a wart. The Dodo
coat of arms looks like a crazed ornitho-
rhynchus or a cow with a beak. Dodo makes
allusions to Australian burning questions and
wants to invest another tuppence in Tattersall’s.
He is an amusing, doddering little old king—a
buffoon even when he’s gloomily wondering how
he can get back his lost youth. To give him as
husband to the beautiful Amazonian monarch was
a piece of mad extravaganza on the part of the
Pixley person, but then “ King Dodo” may come
under the index of musical burlesque, and that is
irresponsible lunacy trimmed with song and night-
mare. Miss Maud Amber plays Lilli, the Queen
of Spoojuland, and the composers have given
her some attractive songs in one of their lucid in-
tervals. “ The Moon and the Star ” was composed
in quite a sane interval. Mr. Sheridan, of Widow
O’Brien fame, makes a diverting, old, silly-faced
King Dodo, and Mr. Winfield Blake, the only
heroic male character in the piece, is Piola, Cap-
tain of the King’s guard. He has some good
musical opportunities. The co. had only a fort-
night to rehearse the piece, so first night’s perform-
ance was rather crude in the matter of chorus and
minor details.

At Sydney Royal, “ Pygmalion and Gala-
tea ” was to have been produced on Wednesday
night, after this paper had gone to press to cope
with the demands of an enormous circulation. That
dainty statue story is only billed to survive
until Saturday, when “Monsieur Beaucaire”
will be staged with Mr. Maud Osborne in the
title role. There is no reasonable ground for sus-
picion that the gentleman in question is a
star actor, but he may be, and so as to
be on the side of safety the management is
keeping the fact of his appearance in a favored
beauty rdle from the convalescent Julius Knight.
Mr. Knight is getting better, but it is not advis-
able to take risks with his health as yet. Whether
Mr. Osborne’s Beaucaire is to be taken as a joke
or not, its first night on Saturday will be a great
social event, with Lord and Lady Northcote
present.

G. F. Golden’s yarns continue to be the
bright spot on an otherwise rather drab pro-
gramme at the Tivoli. Also, his mimicry creates
a more favorable impression as he goes along.
He has a theory that you can always tell what an
actor did for a crust before he went crazy and
took to the stage for a living, and develops it by
explaining how ex-pug. Jeffries makes love (you
can almost see the uppercut coming), and how
various other people tell the heroine that they’ll
protect her to their last gasp. It’s a novel show,
and worth the money. Mdlle. Guerra continues
dancing, and when you have seen her dance you
wonder why she sings ; M'Ginty continues to be
rude to J. W. Winton ; and other things mostly
continue as they were this time last week.

It were hardly correct to say that “Bill
Adams” was produced at Melbourne Princess’s
last Saturday. “Bill” was produced at Sydney
Criterion earlier in the month, and then he moved
to Melbourne for a change of domicile. He belongs
to the very restless order of musical creations, does
Adams. A fortnight ago this journal remarked
in other words, that a critic who explored Wil-
liam’s bumps with a view to discovering an organ
of common sense would draw a blank. Also he
would be flying in the face of the advt., where the
word “extravaganza” is expected to make its
meaning clear. “Bill Adams” has no common
sense, but he is full of song and dance, and rapid
conversation, the dialogue consisting mainly
of strange questions and irrelevant replies.
A part-author of the “ book” —if Bill can be said
to have a book—is described on the programme as
Bacchus, and doubtless Bacchus was Bacchus when
he went to work. The result is brighter than
many a comparatively sober musical comedy.
George Stephenson’s show avoids the paths that
lead to unfavorable comparison as regards the
numerousness of the company and the weight of
the spectacle. One can laugh at the absurdities
on their merits without mistaking them for bril-
liant flashes of humor. The fun, as a rule, looks
rather cheap, but perhaps it would appear more
valuable if it were not plentiful—like fruit out of
season.
* * * *
The co. has taken in some new members
—Miss Roland Watts-Phillips and Lissant—since
the previous Melbourne season, whilst the old
members have been sharpening their familiar
methods and, perhaps, profiting by experience.
Miss May Beatty has even sharpened her figure.
Instead of the bouncing breadthsome charmer of
yore, we find a quite slim young May, who has
lost the bulk of her singing voice, but is, in other
respects, improved by modification. Edward
Lauri is as quick and lively as ever, but
a little less aggressive, and M'Naughfcon is
original, and sufficiently a mimic of George
Huntley to make a good deal of a good part.
The Bovis Bros., Miss Garstang, Miss Nixon,
and the chorus, are equal to the occasion, and
the fact that the Stephenson Co. can dance in
all directions is put beyond dispute. There is
dance movement —more than enough—in the
frivolous music. A dance in the first act intro-
duces an effect of electric lights which is remark-
able for being artistic. As a rule, the lights that
gleam from the dresses or headgear of ballet
nymphs are the merest freaks of decoration.

Hugo Heermann, the violinist who is said
to be adored in Berlin and belauded in every
other large musical city of the world beyond Aus-
tralia, will give his firsc concert at Melbourne
Town Hall next Saturday afternoon (17th), and
his second concert on the following Tuesday
night. The matinee event is Beethoven’s con-
certo, for which a full orchestra is in active train-
ing under W. A. Laver’s direction.
“ Sporting Life,” at Melbourne Royal, is
one of the few Blandoltian melodramas which pro-
claim their meaning in their titles. The first scene
is the spacious yard of Lord Walter Baker’s train-
ing stables j the second act closes with an auc-
tioneer in the background, preparing to knock
down his lordship’s crocks to the highest bidders.
The third act brings professional pugs, and
wrestlers into play, and the feast of sport culmin-
ates in a Derby race, whereby the busted Bak. r is
restored to affluence and happiness. Like all other
stories of betting transactions, this reckless narra-
tive takes no trouble to explain how a bank-
rupt owner is able to back the first favorite
to win a fortune, considering that never an Ikey
in the ring would book a wager with him. But
Baker works the old miracle once again. Fortunes
come easy to punters on Bland Holt’s racecourses,
where the bad men have unlimited money to lose,
and the virtuous men have no means of paying
their debts if they don’t win. It happens, for a
change, that the jew money-lender in “Sporting
Life” is not a bad man as far as the audience
know. He wears a wonderful light overcoat and
performs little deeds of charity in public. Pos-
sibly he bleeds the widow and the fatherless
behind the scenes, but his victims hold, their
tongues, anyhow. Discreet silence is commonly
practised in “ Sporting Life.” The girl who was
betrayed doesn’t go around and talk about
her troubles, neither does the Law shriek for ven-
geance when young man Maxwell throttles Miss
Harrie Ireland to death in a sitting-room at the
Hotel Cecil. Darkness falls upon the corpse, and
nothing further is heard about the melancholy
circumstance. If the Bland Holt co. had been
making its first appearance in Australia last
Saturday night, The Bulletin would utter here-
with a number of admiring comments instead of
leaving them unsaid. It is only necessary to men-
tion that the co. does itself justice. The members
run up to their usual form, and they carry the
confidence of the public. In short, they are all
there. Bland Holt, as the benevolent usurer, is
so favorably placed from the start that he comes
in an easy winner by a long nose; whilst Miss
Jennie Pollock, who rarely gets a sorrow-stricken
part to play, reveals an unsuspected aptitude for
putting tenderness into her voice.

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), this
(Thursday) is the last night of Andrew Mack,
who has kept the green lamp of Irish drama
burning brightly for nine weeks. The warbling
comedian farewells in “The Way to Kenmare,”
and nothing less than an earthquake can prevent
the theatre being crowded when he breathes his
soft adieu. On Saturday the business in hand
will be the re-appearance of Miss Nance O’Neil,
supported by her own co. Melbourne remembers
the tall lady as an actress with an impressive
personality and a fine raking stride. Magda was
Miss O’Neil’s inaugural heroine four year ago ;
and as Magda, the stormy, impenitent young
woman with a Past, she will appear again on
Saturday night.

Those well-coached amateurs, the Players,
drew a full house to Melbourne Princess’s last
Friday, when they repeated their intelligent, un-
stagey treatment of H. A. Jones’ “Physician.”
The representation, of course, lacked the polish of
experience. Such details as exits and entrances,
as dealt with by novices, are generally mere crude
acts of necessity. In the hands of artists, they
expand into subtle manifestations of perfect train-
ing. An exit, for instance, may be Art, or it may
be j ust so much meat and clothes getting through
an opening regardless of consequences. Much,
however, may be forgiven to amateurs like the
Players, who dare to be quiet and natural, instead
of feverishly reproductive of the by-play and
mannerisms of last week’s “star.” Lawrence
Hardinge was manly and impressive, if a shade
unemotional, as the Physician ; D. M. Beere,
as the alcoholic maniac, and J. R. Castling, as
the charming old parson, were neither of them
unworthy of the fine parts allotted to them.
Among the ladies, Miss Georgina O’Meara, as
the heroine, showed distinct improvement on her
previous stage form. Miss Katherine Hesper
was bright, and Miss Grace Millar achieved a
cheerful picture of a comely village charmer.
Most of the minor characters covered themselves
and director Gregan M‘Mahon with credit.

“ 0.K.” throws a well-deserved brick :
The saddest shilling’s worth of entertainment I have
ever struck was a “gymkhana” perpetrated at the Mel-
bourne Exhibition Oval last week. It was a bank holiday
show. The unsuspecting public had been loudly exhorted
to roll up, and the grand stand reserve was a shilling
extra. I remember with horror and indignation that I
nearly paid a second * bob ’ into the gymkhana fund.
True, it was for an excellent charity—the St. Vincent’s
Hospital. But I had gone to the bleak show-place for
entertainment —bright, heart-stirring entertainment, not
for cold charitable purposes. As far as the hospital is
concerned I wish the gymkhana had charged me two
shillings to stop away, and had kept me out by main force
after taking the money. The star item at this alfresco
matinee was a “ musical ride.” Several pairs of nice red-
coated gentlemen and white-robed ladies went through a
mild series of evolutions on horseback, whilst the band
played. They processed in single file, or two abreast,
or three abreast; then back to single file again, and so on
for about 20 minutes. The next item was a puerile display
of jumping over hurdles by two of the nice gentlemen,
one of whom didn’t ride verj' charmingly. Later on the
gentlemen and ladies jumped the hurdles in straggling
couples at a slow pace. And oh ! the “ low-comedy ” dis-
play of “ ridiculous turn-outs.” I think it was the com-
petition of comic vehicles and funny occupants that drove
me from the scene marvelling at the audacity of such
circus performers. A gymkhana, seemingly, is a society
circus, and judged by the fair comparison of an amateur
theatrical performance, or a non-professional nigger
minstrel entertainment, it is undoubtedly Wicked. Put
into Fitzgeralds’ Circus building or Wirth’s tent it would
look less worth a shilling than an amateur theatrical show
is worth a pound. The faces of the assembled multitude
bore witness to this truth. I had never before seen so
many sad and weary people mourning over a wasted bank
holiday, and wondering what they had done to deserve a
gymkhana.

The Melbourne Opera House programme
for the moment is just what it was a week ago,
T red Millis and Alice Pearce sharing the dignity
of large type. At the Bijou the career of Walter
Sanford and his Players has now extended into
the fourth month, and is still extending. Also
the prices retain their popularity and the bill is
changed every week.

The Brough-Flemming Co. will have opened
in “ Beauty and the Barge,” at Adelaide Royal,
before this issue sees the light, which is the best
dramatic news that Tortoise Town has heard for a
long time. Meanwhile, W. Anderson has been
profitably filling in a long gap with melodrama,
to the satisfaction of the se who like their thrills
sharp and their horrors thick and slab. The
Avalon-Collard five have played a short return
season at the Tivoli, with a new programme that
was as gentlemanly and ladylike (and also as
bright and clever) as the old one.
The Wild Cat Column.
The Butter Commission, after a full knowledge
■of the agents’ tricks, recommends legislation which will
allow the suppliers of any private factory to take over the
concern on a co-operative basis. This proposal is de-
nounced by the Argus as “ suggested confiscation,”
although provision is made, of course, for payment in full
for the business. But the Argus omits to mention the
“ confiscation ” practised on the farmers’ butter by the
agents, prior to the Commission. A second recommenda-
tion is, that suppliers shall be compelled to send their
milk to their own district factories. On this point a
lamenting agent says ingenuously, “If any factory
cannot compete and pay the same price as other
factories, it must be against the interests of producers
to supply their milk or cream to such factory.”
But one of the most successful tricks of the Melbourne
agents, whose palatial “ butter factories” are situated in
the city, was to send round touts to those districts where
co-operative factories were struggling for a foothold, and
offer prices for cream which were beyond the power of
the local factories to pay—if they wanted to remain sol-
vent. As the Commission drily observes, however, “this
was not philanthropy.” The undisguised aim of the
Melbourne sharks was to break up the co-operative fac-
tories ; then they were able, afterwards, to buy the cream
on their own terms. By this means several excellent
factories, particularly in the Gippsland and north-eastern
districts, were ruined, w’hile the co-operative movement
received a severe set-back. If each dairyman were, as the
Commission proposes, compelled to supply his own fac-
tory, the co-operative principle would receive a much-
needed help, while in the end the dairymen would really
be the gainers.

lyuo •• \ Written off Reserves £12,608 —61,17 d
Of the profit made in 1904-5, £lOOO was handed over as a
contribution to the Town Fund; to that extent the
undertaking aided the general revenues of the city, and
thus reduced ordinary rates on property. This contribu-
tion is defended, or explained, by the electric supply
committee in this way:—“ Inasmuch as the elec-
tric supply undertaking is directly chargeable upon the
Town Fund, and the responsibility of any deficiency would
have to be borne by the citizens, it is the usual practice,
when funds will permit thereof, for a portion of the surplus
revenue to be appropriated for grants to the Town Fund.”
Whose “usual practice”? If the electric supply com-
mittee wants to guard the Town Fund against having to
make good a deficiency, its best plan would seem to be to
build up its owm reserves and reduce its loan liabilities.
To make the city some recompense for taking a risk when
that risk can be abolished is very like leaving a hole in a
boat and paying a man to pump w'hen the man’s wages
would more than pay for stopping the hole. If the £lOOO
were put to reserves, it would be there when it was
wanted ; if it is handed over to the Town Fund, it will be
used as revenue, and won’t be available anymore.
In the foregoing the amount available for sink-
ing fund and other reserves is shown ; hereunder is shown
the total capital expenditure year by year and the amount
required as sinking fund (1 per cent, sinking fund proper,
2 per cent, depreciation and renewal reserve): —

Operations began in 1894, but complete figures for the
early years are not available. Down to 1889 the sinking-
fund charges were 2Jper cent. ; after that 3 per cent.; and
on that basis £16,185 was called for down to Feb., 1900,
instead of which, as shown above, £22,332 was accumu-
lated. Down to Feb., 1905, £59,076 was called for, and
£73,784 had been accumulated. This is satisfactory ;it
means that, after paying full interest, very nearly 4 per
cent, was earned, and was available for sinking fund and
other reserves. On the average capital invested
last year the earnings (including, of course, interest
on sinking fund, &e.) amounted to £lO 7s. 3d. per cent.
In the previous year it was £9 4s. lOd. Meantime, also,
reductions have been made in the charges for light and
power; these have, however, been more than balanced by
a reduction in costs. The average charge per unit sold in
1903-4 was 2’410d. ; last year 2’094d. Last year’s progress
was most marked in connection with power-supply ; the
increase was from 351,472 units to 621,829 units. Part of
this increase was due to demand for current for elevators ;
the number of machines driven increased from 26 to 39.
These figures are not large ; but the length of the jump
can’t be too pleasant a subject for the hydraulic people to
think about.

(apparently at market price), £9182 in Fremantle and
East Fremantle debentures, £9365 in the Town Fund at
3J p.c. (this alone is a substantial aid to city revenue),
and the balance is apparently on current account. lhe
business appears to have been excellently managed all
through. Up to now its socialistic character doesn t
appear to have seriously interfered with the marriage-tie
or the sanctity of the home ; all it lias done has been to
give cheap light and power, while building up reserves
which augur still cheaper light and power in the future.
Altogether, it doesn’t look a bit like the monster which
G. H. Reid, M'Millan, and the anti-Socialists represent
Socialism to be. In fact, the public probably wouldn t
recognise this cool, calm, energetic and beneficial business
enterprise as Socialism. And yet it is. It is the real
thing, while Reid’s monster is mere nightmare.

As expected, the trouble in connection with
the Equitable Life Assurance Co. of. New York is mainly
with regard to investments. It is alleged, and not
denied, that a syndicate, including some of the directors,
has acted a 3 middleman, buying stock and passing it on
to the co.; and a refund of the commissions thus drawn is
talked of. The co. has a huge surplus of £16,582,672 over
and above the capital (£20,550, which is restricted to a
7 p.c. div.) and assurance and annuity fund (£67,943,052);
and the handling of this surplus is also a cause of much
trouble. But, as might be judged from the size of the
surplus, the Investigation Committee has reported that,
so far as policy-holders are concerned, chey are most
amply covered. The whole row is largely promoted by
the agents, who find themselves handicapped when com-
peting with mutual offices; and one almost certain
development will be the organisation of a new and
vigorous office.

The season just closed has been disastrous for
Che “ shrewd business man ” who generally makes a heavy
profit by selling other persons’ wheat in England. The
number of wheat-laden ships lost daring the past year
has been a record ; while of those which reached port, a
large percentage were forced to jettison a portion of their
cargo. Several Sydney brokers are reported to be either
broke or in difficulties. On so large a scale has disaster
overtaken the wheat ship of late, that it is plainly essen-
tial, when the Navigation Bill gets before Parliament, to
review the existing State legislation as to the load-line on
grain carriers. Grain has long been recognised as the
most dangerous of all cargo, except possibly coal, and the
present State regulations, especially for ships arriving in
Europe during the winter season, seem quite inadequate.

Another bank which shows a slight slackening-off of
profits. Still, considering the figures, profits are better
than might have been expected. At May, 1903, the bank
showed interest-bearing deposits of only £216,886 and
advances of £594,914. Now it is paying interest on
£15,322 more deposits, while the advances have shrunk
£50,224, and yet £383 more profit is shown. On present
figures the bank is earning more than it did in 1903, though,
given similar conditions, it ought to be earning less ; and
the chances are that a decline is in view. Capital is
£152,040; on this and reserves combined the earnings
have recently been (per cent, per annum) :
Nov., 1900 ..£6 1 8 p.c. May, 1903 ..£5 7 9 p.c.
May, 1901 .. 51211 „ Nov., 1903 .. 5 2 8 „

May, 1902 .. 418 9 „ Nov., 1904 .. 518 1 „
Nov., 1902 .. 418 7 „ May, 1905 .. 514 5 „
The return is by no means high, considering that, even
now, in spite of increased deposits and reduced advances,
•only 28 per cent, of the liabilities to the public are repre-
sented by liquid assets. But expenses are comparatively
high, though, in view of the number of its small
branches, the National of Tasmania does its work
very cheaply indeed. Take for comparison the
well-managed Colonial of Australasia. Of its gross
profits, £5O os. 7d. per cent, goes in expenses; of the
National’s, £34 18s. per cent, including income-tax. Or
while £lO6 of advances in the Tas. National cost in manage-
ment £1 per half-year, £74 in the Colonial cost £l. It
•doesn’t, therefore, look as though it is through paying
princely salaries that the National Bank can’t show more
•than £5 14s. sd. per cent, on its funds, notwithstanding
That it keeps comparatively small reserves. It looks more
as though the State’s Tory legislation had blocked pro-
gress and prevented a brisk demand for money.
It is interesting to learn that in 1904, when the
Kanaka was just beginning to fade and it was generally
understood that the sugar industry was going to the
‘animals that licked Lazarus, the area under cultivation in
‘Queensland (120,317 acres) was the largest on record, and
(the yield of sugar (147,688 tons) was the largest save the
record crop of 1898.

Sydney papers have been talking about a
mysterious English co. which has taken up large shale
and oil deposits in N.S. Wales, and now is pulling the
Government’s ear for railway and other concessions.
Capital mentioned is £400,000; and various people have
expressed great joy at such an influx of British money.
But the joy is premature ; for N.S.W. Mines Department,
if it doesn’t want N.S.W. mining to smell a lot worse
in England than it does at present, ought to say first
what it thinks of the chances of a huge co. making a
“do’’out of N.S.W. shale and oil. If it thinks the co.
has wretched chances, then the occasion isn’t one for joy
at all. The deposits are said to be at Capertee, where
the N.S.W. Shale and Oil Co. has been at work for
about 30 years, present co. being a reconstruction of
older co.’s. It has had every kind of experience,
has always been on the look-out for properties,
and presumably wouldn’t touch these “vast deposits”
that J. Bull is said to have bought at a huge price, simply
because it didn’t think them good enough. In 1898 this
co. paid one poor little div. of 2J per cent., amounting to
£833; since then it has not paid a cent, though it has been
grafting hard all the time. During 1904 it certainly did
make a profit of £5391, as the result of some extra-good
contracts; but all this was absorbed in writing-down
values of machinery which had been worn out in the
weary struggle during the years when it was making
losses. And only last year, when £25,000 of 5J per cent,
debentures were falling due, co. had to agree to pay 6 per
cent, to get them renewed for four years.
Facts with regard to this mysterious English
float seem to be that the eye of J. Bull has been caught
by the richness of the comparatively small quantity of
picked stuff which has been sent away lately ; though, in
spite of its richness, the N.S.W. Shale Co.’s profit, as
shown, has been very small. Who J. Bull is in this partic-
ular case, can’t be said for certain, but he is alleged to be
mostly Newnes, the newspaperman ; and if Newnes loses
his money, as he has a first-rate chance of doing, Aus-
tralia will probably get some kind attention from the
Newnes papers, as well as the Harmsworth papers, when
next it has a loan falling due. Still Newnes can’t say that
Australia incited him to this deaL Alleged that he put a
solid £lOO,OOO into the new concern, that another £lOO,OOO
was raised otherwise, and that the promoters get £lOO,OOO
and 200,000 shares. If so, they are mighty lucky promo-
ters. Possibly the promoters reckoned that they had a
big thing to offer Bull; all the same they were either
lucky or wise in not offering it to Australia. If they had,
and had asked £400,000 for it, or £200,000, or even
£lOO,OOO, the proposal would have been received as one of
the jokes of a dull season. And it seems to be N.S. Wales'
duty to tell Newnes & Co. so at the earliest possible
moment.
N.S.W. Registrar of Friendly Societies (Statist
Coghlan) wrote his last report with gall; and gall was the
proper ink to use. Friendly societies are the poor man’s
banks and insurance offices; and the older ones were
mostly heaped together by amateurs, who reckoned that
it was quite easy to throw four three-penny bits into a
till and take out half-a-crown. J. B. Trivett, the
actuary, made a complete valuation of assets and
liabilities as at the end of 1899, and found that there
wasn’t one single solvent society in the State. Even then,
though the actuary assumed that the funds would
earn at least 3 per cent, for the future, the average
earnings for six years had been only 271 per cent.
Lumped together, the liabilities for sick and funeral
benefits amounted to £3,795,013; the assets (including
present value of all future contributions), only £2,541,182.
Liabilities thus exceeded assets by £1,253,831. The older
the societies get, the bigger the drain is on the funds.
By 1901 there were already 53 societies which were
admittedly “broke,” and oouldn’t pay the full benefits
agreed on ; while there were 184 which were living on
their scanty reserves, and rushing fast towards eventual
repudiation. One old and big society has paid £7213. out
of the central funds in 10 years, and has only received
£3902; so that the old branches have loafed to the
extent of £3311 on the branches which haven’t yet
got gout to any great extent, and haven’t so far
accumulated any large number of widows. An
Act was passed in 1899 calling on the societies to leave
off making an ass of themselves, and deluding their mem-
bers into the belief that they could get 31 quarts out of a
pint pot; but they mostly kicked, and when they didn’t
kick they dtdged, and put up the “ good local member ”
to propose amendments. One result was that societies
were given till '903 to start being honest. Thereupon
some of the societies, instead of shutting down hard upon
the admission of members on the old bankruptcy basis,
whipped up every derelict they could lay hands on, and
decorated him with millinery, and undertook to give him
4s. 9d. worth for 25., though they had nothing but a
big deficit to pay the balance of 2s. 9d. with. The
new members have now to pay 4s. 9d. ; but
through the rush of members on the two shilling
basis, even the 4s. 9d. won’t be sufficient. But
the chances are that, when the new member sees that
the money he is paying in to provide for his own
gouty days, and for his own rheumatism and his own
widow, is being collared to pay for somebody else’s gout
and rheumatism and widow, he will kick. At least he
will kick if he isn’t a fool ; though it won’t be any use
kicking unless he forms a brand new society, or insists on
the old society keeping his money separate from the
funds of the old insolvent period.

For purposes of comparison, Broken Hill co.s’
statements of costs are not worth much. Block 10 quotes
15s. lljd. per ton of ore for mining and ore-dressing ; but
total costs seem to have been about 18s. Id., and then
apparently nothing is charged for wear and tear. Sulphide
Corporation’s last figures were 16s. Id. ; but that covered
everything. South quotes lowest, 13s. 6Jd. ; that covers
mining, refilling, developing, and milling, but, it seems,
nothing else. North costs are given at 14s. 3‘6d., which
again seem to include nothing for anything beyond mining
and milling. There is not much to choose in the matter
of costs between the South and its neighbor and rival,
the Sulphide ; yet one quotes 13s. 6£d., the other 16s. Id.
The managers surely might come to some agreement to
present these returns on the same basis.
• • * *
Study of balance-sheets of principal Broken
Hill co.’s, and comparison of metallurgical figures of the
co.’s which smelt, with those of the co.’s which sell their
concentrates, indicate that there is but little difference
in the respective gross profits, calculated, of course, at
per ton of ore raised. The B.H. Prop, and the Sulphide
Corporation naturally experience their best times when
the metal market is with them; but that would not
necessarily be the case with such co.’s as the South,
British, and Block 10, which have to depend entirely
upon the requirements of the foreign smelters. At
present moment returning charges are low; conse-
quently profits of non-smelting co.’s are above normal,
for lead and silver markets are, according to good advices,
quite high enough, and it is safe to assume that, at
expiration of present contracts, returning charges will be
raised, and profits of selling co.’s correspondingly re-
duced. It is a point not to be overlooked in estimating
values of these cos.’ shares, and the probable course of
the market.

So far, spite of all the talk about zinc, there’s
very little margin in the business at Broken Hill. Block
14 treated last half 19,000 tons tailings for £l9ll profit,
just about 2s. per ton. Stuff assayed 15'6 p.c. zinc. But
for the last half-year the mill worked (in 1900) the ore
ran only iO'l p.c. zinc, and the tailings would probably
be poorer than that, on the average. If 15’6 p.c. stuff can
only give 2s. profit, what about the 10 p.c. (and less)
stuff ? There isn’t much room for a market movement
even if the grade kept up. Certainly costs (over 11s. per
ton) should be capable of a heavy reduction.

People who were responsible for introducing it
have to own up at last that magnetic concentration won’t
so far successfully handle B.H. Junction North ore.
Attention now has to be given to the old wet system of
concentration. Manager Stockdale has stuck to the latter
all along, and alleges that if he can’t make the mine pay
on that system he won’t mind being kicked out of Broken
Hill. Local people still have heaps of confidence in the
show. Of the two Barrier men who were lately put on
the board, one, who in a general way isn’t a big speculator,
still hangs on to 7500 shares. It wouldn’t be surprising if
an offer for the whole concern were to come shortly
from a foreign syndicate.

Dudley colliery, Newcastle (N.S.W.), was full of

rat has been seen in the mine, although adjoining col-

Transpired at the London meeting of share-
holders in the Lloyd Copper Co., Burraga (N.S.W.), that
the co. has an overdraft of £12,673. The meeting might
have been a gathering of Dippers—it was so damp and
dismal.

Mt. Boppy North, adjoining Mt. Boppy
(N.S.W.), and, like it, Bull-owned, still shoves along
grittily. To date nearly £3OOO has been sunk in pros-
pecting ; and beyond the channel, which may or may not
be the right thing, there isn't anything to show for it.
Co. has now decided to sink main shaft, which is in reef
stuff, from 200 ft. to 400 ft. Mine is to be equipped with
necessary gear, including rock-drills; and, as parent
mine has proved the life of the reef beyond the fault,
chances are that depth is all that is required to bring the
North into prominence.

North Cobar (N.S.W.), mentioned last week as
having been sold (subject to shareholders’ consent) to
“ the Syndicate,” has, it is now stated, been sold to a
syndicate—which isn’t quite the same thing, so far as
Cobar is concerned. Price mentioned is £12,500. This is
understood to be another of the “good things” into
which newspaper-man Newnes. of England, has been put.
Said that an electrical ore-finder was tried on the pro-
perty, with results which made all the years of fruitless
prospecting done by the co. blush a deep crimson. There-
upon £12,500 was offered to the owners, which was a heap
more than the market had judged the show worth ; and
forthwith poor old J. Bull was asked to put his money
into a £lOO,OOO co. First proposal was 25,000 shares
to the public (Newnes being most, if not all, the public),
£12,500 going to the owners, and £12,500 and 75,000
shares to the people who had found out wliat an amaz-
ingly good thing the North Cobar is. When, however, it
was pointed out that that would leave the co. without
working capital, it was proposed that £12,500 should go
to the co., instead of to the promoters, and that the
people who put up the money should also get a few of the
paid shares ; and it looks as though the thing was fixed
at that. Even now capital available is utterly inade-
quate ; and, in spite of the electrical ore-finder, prospects
are poor. Anyhow, the dead weight and ballast of paid-
up shares is absurdly heavy for a prospecting show.

From the prospectus of the once-more-to-be-

in cash of £3OOO and 10,000 paid-up shares in the new co.
for services rendered to old and new co.’s; and in the
event of the extension of the railway to Etheridge, a fur-
ther sum in cash of £2OOO for further services.” Private
railway bills and schemes; £3OOO, 10,000 paid-up shares ;
a further £2OOO if it comes off. Smell anything ?

Although Ravenswood (N.Q.) goldfield returns
for May show an increase of 6260 z. over those for May,
1904, field is at present not looking so well as could be
wished. New Ravenswood, Ltd., a Bull-owned property,
is making strenuous efforts to keep up appearances, but
the stone is apparently getting poorer. Management is
now not booming the new treatment plant so much, but
it’s about time that it commenced to tell a tale.
The London Co. is producing slightly better
material, and gained some local notoriety' lately
by what the press described as a “big deal” in its
shares. Said “ big deal ” consisted of about 3000 shares
changing hands at something under 45., and the pur-
chasers are regarded as being “in the know.” As with
many other Ravenswood properties, it would not take
long to know everything concerning the London. But
Co. is gradually creeping out of its kindergarten methods,
although it’s doubtful if the finances will permit it to
grow into a healthy child. Ravenswood Deeps are now
looking—successfully—for more money. W. Phillpotts,
an Englishman with American mining experience, has
just been sent out from England to assist Lawrence
Wilson in his grope for the Sunset reef.
* * * •
Ravenswood Deep Mines (N.Q.) are now en-
deavoring to find the money wherewith to locate Sunset
reef. Local shareholders have fallen in with Bull’s pro-
posal that said wherewithal be loaned by shareholders to
co. at 7£ per cent, per annum. In return for this
holders are given the option of taking up additional
shares at par. Exactly' what co. will raise by this means
is not yet known ; but unless the Sunset reef is tapped
pretty quickly present indications are that Ravenswood
will slump almost beyond recall.
Queensland gold returns continue to drop back.
Figures for May are 49,8890 z. compared with 60,3300 z. for
May, 1904. Decreases are—Charters Towers, 63440 z. ;
Gyinpie, 21370 z.: Croydon, 11450 z. ; Mt. Morgan, 1138 oz. ;
Hodgkinson, 4920 z. ; Etheridge, 2470 z. ; and sundry
minor falls. Ravenswood alone shows an increase—36l7oz.
as against 29910 z. for May 1904. Notable that Croydon is
not on the same side as Ravenswood, though for some time
past Queensland has been relying upon Croy'don to dis-
count the falls of the other fields.

Report of E. A. Weinberg on the Mount
Molloy (N.Q.) copper mine is published. Very optimistic ;
sets down the value of the present known ore reserves at
precisely £152,522 9s. Method by which this result is
arrived at is, however, not beyond question. First doubt
arises in estimation of ore reserves. “ Ore actually
broken,” and doubtless assayed, goes 9'5 per cent, copper.
That seems right. Ore blocked out, 24,215 tons; assay,
13'5 per cent, copper. That may be right. “Standing
partially blocked out, 5168 tons; assay, 10 per cent.”
This may be wholly wrong. Ore which is only “par-
tially blocked out ” can neither be set down in tons nor
in metallic contents, and certainly should not figure in
“ Ore Reserves.” Other lines come under the heading of
“ Reasonably Expected ” —viz., 6500 tons of 10 per cent,
sulphides and 3800 tons of 8 per cent, oxidised ore. These
“ reasonably expected ” items are also valued in the ore
reserves. Second doubtful point in Weinberg’s estimates
is that the value of copper has been taken on a basis of
£65. For ordinary purposes this is quite £5 above what
some careful men would take, and in some circles £6O is
considered to be higher than the average of the next
12 months will prove to be. Third doubtful point in the
report is that only 50s. per ton is allowed for smelting and
realisation. This in view of the position of the mine
appears insufficient. Mount Molloy will require abso-
lutely nothing to go wrong if it is to realise the dreams of
its promoters.

Brilliant Extended, the mine Charters Towers
(Q.) depends unon to prove the deep ground, for the half-
year treated 12,951 tons, worth £2 Bs. Id. per ton. Pre-
vious term, 11,388 tons, valued at £2 18s. a ton. Costs pan
out—mining, 325. 9d.; milling, 6s. Id.; cyaniding, ss. Id. ;
total £2 3s. lid. ; administration, Is. 7d., not included.
Costs of development cannot be arrived at, as part is
boxed up with stoping. Decline of ldwt. in value of stone
will place the co. in a tight position. Management is
moving in the dark, as no sampling has been done.
Battery seems to be run for a time ; then there’s a clean-
up. If returns are low the mill is started again on better
stuff, and an average is thus maintained. Evidently
there is no stone worth mentioning in reserve. Manager
Macleod says an estimate of ore reserves and value
cannot be made without a large expenditure, on account
of the stopes varying from day to day. “ Such an expen-
diture Ido not consider warranted.” Yet 1180 tons were
put through as a trial from Nos. 6 and 7 west for 7dwt.
to 4dwt. a ton. This is rather expensive sampling when
costs are £2 3s. lid. a ton. Stopes are at present small,
notably No. 9 west, from which 2992 tons have been taken
for the six months. No. 2 supplied 5173 tons, nearly
half the quantity crushed. This stope still con-
tains a block, 200 ft. x 100 ft., with 2ft. to sft. of mineral
stone. Costs are so high as to call for attention
at once. Mine is looking well in the deep ground,
Five feet of mineral stone is showing in the hanging wall
at 11 east, 2300 feet vertical depth. A trial parcel is to be
put through; should it come up to expectations, and
there is no reason why it shouldn’t, it will be the deepest
payable stone worked on the field. A hundred feet further
down the underlie, on the west side, a level has been
started on 2ft. of stone. Balance sheet shows a credit of
£7013 ; from this the second half-yearly instalment of
£1250 is to be paid towards the purchase of the battery.
In three months a lump sum of £lO,OOO is to be paid.
Profits for the next couple of years are ear-marked for
purchase money and improvements.

O.K.’s dividend, paid this month, is the first
to come out of a N.Q. copper mine, in spite of the
Chillagoe and half-a-dozen other expensive booms. Half-
year’s profit and loss showed output worth £15,231,
expenses £9623, profit £5608. Financial position on
March 31st wasn’t, however, particularly strong. Co.
owed the bank net £3994 and other creditors £2498;
against that it had matte on hand £7600, and a few small
items —mostly stores, &c. There has certainly been two
months’ production since then, making on May 24 an
estimated balance available of £15,000. Manager Gibb
andconsulting engineerßrander estimate reserves of 22 p.c
ore at about 63,000 tons ; but of this it does not appear that
more than 29,000 tons are in sight; and N.Q. experience
in estimating reserves that are not in sight has been disas-
trous. “ Assuming the indications to hold good over the
whole area of the ore bodies,” says Allan Gibb, there
should be 33,800 tons below the level explored ; and that
is a large assumption. There are also 23,000 tons of 8 per
cent, ore ; but this cannot be worked at present. To get
out the proposed 300 tons of copper a month will call for
1600 tons of ore, and on basis of past figures should give
nearly £lO,OOO profit; but copper is steadily falling, and
estimates have been made on what looks like the top of
the market. In Jan.-Feb.-March of last year average
London quotation was £57 Is.; same months this year,
£6B Is. ; and now it is barely over £65. Whatever its
speculative value, £160,000 seems to cover the visible
profit in the mine, which, nevertheless, is valued by the
market at just upon £300,000. Any satisfactory develop-
ments are thus heavily discounted already.

South Dempsey’s, Gaffney’s Creek (Vic.), whose
start was to sink a shaft in the bed of the creek, immedi-
ately south of New Dempsey’s, and equip with a tin-pot
plant, has left that portion of the lease and begun to ex-
plore an old tunnel on the opposite side of the range,
known in the early days as the Golden Belt. Co. is now
gathering up battery paraphernalia from defunct district
mines. Large body of low-grade ore has been exposed
in South Dempsey’s present workings, and_ trial crushing
gave Bdwt. per ton. With water as a motive power, this
shouldn’t be too bad.

Mining at Wood’s Point (Vic.) wants a little
more than the winter's rain to make it profitable. Victor
is unable to get on to decent stone; and South Victor,
after years of scratching, is to be snuffed out. It is cer-
tain that the Victor will take the lease, as the extension
of the shoot of gold from which it got its gold
in the past is in the South’s ground, if it is
anywhere. Said that Jamieson, once manager of the
New Loch Fyne, at Matlock, is back at the last-named
mine. Battery is going up at the New Loch Fyne, and
soon we may be able to tell whether the big dyke forma-
tion carries enough gold to make it a second Alaska*

Gt. Southern No. 1, Rutherglen (Vic.), is the
lame duck of the field, and it is diagnosed that it will
never regain its strength. Co.'has been struggling on,
year in and year out, to make decent money out of its
wash-dirt, but it always just fell short of being a good
mine. Its drives are now close to the boundary, its lease
of life is short, and so there isn’t much chance of any
money going to anyone unless co. has a streak of luck
when it tries to mine the small block of Great Southern
lead in its property, drained by the Prentice and Southern.

The crowd that took up the Star of the East,
Ballarat, is having its reward—on the Stock Exchange.
A little flutter prefaced the striking of the Consols lode at
2290 ft., but the real rally came when a few specks of gold
were seen in the stone on the Guiding Star lode in a rise
from the bottom level. Of course, there was a
half-column puff in one of the Melbourne dailies, which
the man who has had Ballarat fever in the past read with
a dengue-fever face. None the less, Stars are so well held
since the days when divs. dropped from the Consols lode at
1400 ft. level like manna, that even a whisper of gold sets
the market dancing. It is no use to say that nothing
worth counting up has come from the mine since then,
save an odd shilling or two paid from the Guiding Star
lode at shallow depths. People all want to strike a mining
double, and so they buy the scrip. The final little move
was over 3ft. of stone showing beyond a slide on the
Consols lode at 2260 ft. Now everyone wants a trial crush-
ing to see if the egg has any
The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 600 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate
mechanical stokers and economiser have also been
ordered from the same firm. This now makes 40 boilers
of the Babcock and Wilcox type supplied to the various
mines and industries at Broken Hill. Wherever economy
in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as
the standard for the British Navy.*

The Wilfley Slime Table which has been in
operation on the Ivanhoe Gold Mines for some months
past has been giving extremely good results. Mr. H. T
Brett, Metallurgist of the Ivanhoe Gold Corporation, in an
article contributed to the March number of the Chamber
of Mines Journal, W.A., gives particulars of the savings
made, and states that the introduction of the Wilfley
Slime Table will be of great service in treating the low-
grade sulphide ores of the field. Since the future of
Kalgoorlie is so intimately bound up with the most
economical solution of this sulphide problem, this
assurance from Mr. Brett is a most important matter.

The strength, lightness, durability and low cost
of spiral rivited pipe have given it a place of superiority
above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coated steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,
New Zealand, and at his engineering and pipe works,

used for making boilers, fluming, refrigerators, bolts, nuts,
and every discription of cast or wrought iron work.*

Is it that Ararat (Vic.) folk have lost all
aggressiveness ? For a quarter of a century the Langi
Looan, one of the finest alluvial claims ever prospected in
Victoria, has been left idle, and no one seems game to
bell the cat. In the old days Gray, of Maldon, was the
holder, and to-da>, if report does not lie, the lease is in
the hands of a iittle crowd that patronises Peacock s
office. Minister M’Leod talks a lot about tribute agree-
ments, but why does he silently permit ground like that
at Ararat to be left idle more than a month?

Melbourne’s Board of Works spent three

Waxellency Madden, presiding at Mel-
bourne Criminal Court, the other day :
There is no sitting of the Criminal Court, and few of the
other courts, from which the Judges do not go home be-
wildered by the effort to defeat justice by the expedient
of lying. Every man at the Bar and on the bench is aware
of that. People who formerly were particularly careful
are now resorting to perjury on the slightest provocation,
in utter defiance of the law, and time and again justice is
notoriously defeated by false-swearing,
It s all part of a growing and general tendency.
Commercial morality weakens under the influence
of fraud. Adulteration of articles of food is
common where it formerly was rare. That the
evidence given in law courts should be also shoddy
is natural enough. In word and deed, the expedi-
ency of lying is recognised, and, if other forms of
dishonesty are exempt from punishment, it stands
to reason that perjury should be now accepted as a
mere matter of course. Perjury starts with the
dishonest baker, the sugar-sanding grocer, and the
shoddy importer. For society to make head
against it, it will be necessary for society to make
an organised campaign against the general tend-
ency to adulterate everything from the beer to the
truth.

A diminutive Sairey Gamp, down South
Melbourne way, took the law into her own hands
lately, and for a space defied the authorities to do
their worst. She had recently superintended the
arrival of a new baby, and part of her bill was
still owing—17s. 6d. to wit. Learning that the
mother was about to join her husband in “ the
West,” Gamp determined on action, and, while
the lady was getting her haberdashery and
the other children aboard the boat, she raided
the house, seized the new infant, and “planted”
it with a friend. Then she went round to
the watch-house, told the sergeant her troubles,
and asked him if she had done right!
That official assured her she was liable to 10 years
and 40 days’ dark cells for kidnapping—but he
Was, nevertheless, very pleased to see her, for the
infant s mother was in the next room and
also in hysterics, and was demanding her baby
immediately, as the boat was just about to
sail. The nurse stolidly demanded her 17s. fid.
Ihe mother had only 12s. fid., and the boat was
even then getting the gangway in. Then the Law
threatened to arrest the kidnapper, but she
replied that in that case the baby would stay
where it was, and she was quite prepared to go to
gaol, even for ten years, but she was going to have
her 17s. 6d, By this time the boat had let the
rope go. Finally, after much argument, the
sergeant persuaded Gamp to accept 10s. on
account, and th,e baby was rescued, and rushed
dovyn to the steamer with its mother, and they
bofh, jumped like kangaroos. It was. ignominious,
but considering how little time the law had to!
turn round in, it is difficult to see that it could
have, donp any more. A week’s solitary might
have broken down the nurse’s resolution, but there
was no timp for that, and there wasn’t a thumb-
screw handy.

Chief Justice Madden, of Victoria, spoke
firmly to.certain lawyers at Ballarat (Vic.) sessions
lately. The. court, had no, sooner opened than
pase after case had to be adjourned. One barrister
faadn t had time to study his brief; another, the
Crown, Prosecutor, was in the same state of ignor-
ance • a third had missed, one of Bent’s casual
trains ; in a fourth case the papers had been sent
to the wrong lawyer, and, so on. Then the Crown
had failed to provide an interpreter for a Hindu
charged a capital offence, whpreupon his
counsel withdrew, and left the case at a standstill.
Madden adjourned most of these matters to the
following sessions, saying bitterly that they might,
as well drop the assizes altogether. In several of
the cases there is a suspicion that the collapse was
carefully arranged. Nobody with, any previous
convictions wants to.be tried by Madden sipce he
devised the, mechanical idea of sentencing a
prisoner to the sum of all his previous sen-,
tences added together. If a man has done t.en
years for bushranging and eight years for highway'
robbery, the Madden system gives, him 18 years.
(it the law will allow it) when he comes up a third
time for sfealing a shirt off a line, and prisoners
would just as soon see the Chief Justice wholly
unemployed nowadays.

a local professor of geology choose between
Gaioola (N.S.W.) and imported Carrara marble
for the statue. Sculptor James White has carried,
his point as to the substitution of white marble
for bronze, and he considers that the Caloola
stone should prove as good as the best for statuary.
Anyhow, it deserves to be put to the proposed
Pour emblematical figures are included in
Mr. White s design, and these are now being
carved in Italy from Carrara marble. If Queen
Victoria stands for an advt. of the Australian
product she will serve the useful purpose of com-
parison in the distant future. We’d like to know
how her Caloolan constitution will bear up against
the ravages of time.

Persistent bad luck appears to attend
Maorilanders who served in that South African
war. In addition to those who have drifted into
gaol, and others who are chronic invalids, and
those who are “stony ” and thirsty, quite a number
have committed suicide or met sudden deaths.
Last disaster chronicled was that of a farm-burner
who was himself burned to death in a pub. at
Gore—of all places in the land.

Ever the landlord !: Victoria has just
spent some £50,000 in closing 37 unnecessary
hotels in North Melbourne, and so far as is visible
the only persons to benefit thereby have been the
landlords of the 20 unclosed pubs.. Last week one
of these got an ejectment order against one of his
tenants, who had demurred to the rent being
violently raised as soon a,s opposition was reduced.
That is the sort of Socialism that Eat cordially
approves; the State pays all the costs and
Private Enterprise reaps all the profits.

He is practically blind and was convicted of
attempting to burn his wife (also nearly blind)
alive. Doubts as his sanity were raised at the
trial, and the desperate attempt to finish his
miserable existence seems to strengthen those
doubts.

A remarkably smart man called recently
on a farmer near Lilimur (Vic.) and told him off-
handedly that there was a Socialistic law by
which he wasn’t allowed to have more
than a certain number of sheep on his
farm, and a certain amount of money in
the bank. And right there he collected
the sheep and money that the farmer possessed
over and above the alleged legal margin. As an
instance of the effects of the Argus’s lies about
Socialism, acting on the weak intellect of the ig-
norant class which supports Bent and the Kyabram
movement, this episode is unique.

I once owned
a girl—for a time
—butsoon found
that a dog or a
motor-car would
be less expen -
sive and easier to
manage. This
girl possessed re-
markable in*
stinct for that
kind of pet. She
was just the or-
dinary variety
of girl, without
any special
markings, and
not particularly
valuable for
show purposes.
One day I took
her up Lane Cove
River and across
the bridge at Fig-
tree. When half-
way across the
bridge I suddenly
missed her. 1
whistled once or
twice, but think-
ing perhaps she
had fallen into
the river and
got drowned, I
walked on, never
expecting to see
her again, of
course. A few
weeks after this
incident busi-
ness took me to
Brisbane, and
while sitting in
my room at the
hotel where I
was staying I
thought I heard
something
knocking at the
door. I opened
the door, and
there stood —no-
body. To make
this story run
in the recognised groove, her wet apparition should have
been on the mat, but it wasn’t. In fact, she wasn’t in the
town at all, and never had been. This girl is now turned
into a woman, and has shown no sign of remarkable in-
stinct since. I only mention these things to show that
the girl, viewed as a domestic pet, is liable to stray away,
and her owner ought always to lead her by a collar and
chain when he takes her out.

A woman’s vanity gives the show away
once more. The other day, three Melbourne
detectives were walking down Hwanston-street,
when a gorgeously-dressed woman, in a very large,
bright, red hat, smote their six eyes all at once.
The red hat was waiting for somebody, and it was
such a remarkable red hat that the detectives
quietly watched. Two men came out of a neigh-
boring hotel, and as they walked towards the
buggy were at once recognised by the ’tecs as old
acquaintances who were wanted to explain away
a little matter of gilded farthings. One of the
great wants of the undeserving criminal classes in
these days is a donah who will not turn the pro-
ceeds of dishonest labor into a gorgeous sealskin
coat or a startling red cart-wheel hat. A lady
of quiet brown tastes would be a great source of
comfort to many a fraudulent man.

She calls from dim hills far away,
Her fair face flits the leaves between ;
Her robes are decked with garlands gay,
And fashioned all of fairy green.
And “ follow, follow me,” she cries,
'‘Recall the joys thou hast forgot,”
So lays upon my dreaming eyes
Her sceptre of Forget-me-not.
Then, glad at heart, I follow her,
The queen of an enchanted land,
The buds of happy years that were,
Break into bloom beneath her hand.
Alight the boughs with wattle gold,
Uplifts the sweet epacris spire,
And in the bushland grasses old
The scarlet runner’s trailing fire.
Belovfcd, when the hour-glass wanes,
And all the ways of earth are brown,
When sunset tints thy window-panes,
And twilight flutters slowly down ;
While waitest thou thy heart’s sunrise,
I pray the Queen of whom we wot
May lay upon thy dreaming eyes
Her sceptre of Forget-me-not.

Sydney divorce case, Crocker v. Crocker,
in which judgment was delivered tor the peti-
tioner, exhibits the amazing daring and resource-
fulness of an excitable female. The respondent,
Mrs. Crocker, some time in 1902, made the ac-
quaintance of a musician named Bedford, the co-
respondent, through answering a matrimonial
advertisement. To him she represented herself
as a single woman —although living with her hus-
band and two children. She explained away her
incumbrances to Bedford by declaring that her
husband was her brother-in-law; that the infants
were his, and that he had engaged her to look
after them while their mother was absent in
Greece, of all places on earth. It would have
been a graceful touch of fancy if she had said that
the mother was disguised in male attire and
serving with the Japanese army, but perhaps she
didn’t think of that. Then she converted Bedford
into a sort of myth, by informing her husband
that a man was haunting her, peering in at the
windows at all hours, and in a general way myste-
riously misbehaving himself. _ She being under
medical treatment for hysteria at the time, the
husband regarded these ideas as mere hallucina-
tions, and the fact of his wife being in such a wild
state induced him to permit her to go away several
times for a change of scene. She went with Bed-
ford as his wife, and for two years she prevented
the men from meeting, and ran her dual existence
successfully. Her little show burst up at last, but
it burst very gracefully, and the respondent was
ready to explain everything to the last.

A Melbourne firm was robbed of a number
of brass engine-fittings some time ago, bought
them back again, not recognising them, and was
subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen
property. The firm escaped with its life, but it
reckons this is a hard world.
In Sydney, a few days ago, a man named
Everingham was tried on a charge of criminal
assault, but as the chief witness against him, a
girl of 16, admitted that, when she swore at the
preliminary inquiry to having seen the assault,
she had been lying, the case broke down. Being
pressed as to why she had endeavored to get an
innocent man into gaol, she said she did it because
Blank Blank (or, as the newspaper report put it,
“ ”) told her to do so. The case
wandered to its final breakdown without the real
name of Blank Blank being published, and there
was no mention, nor has there since been any
mention, so far as The Bulletin is aware, of any
intention to make further inquiry concerning
either the perjured girl witness or her alleged
instigator, Blank Blank. There is something
curiously lop-sided about a system which prints at
full length the two front names and the surname
of the person wrongfully accused of a very bad
offence, and which so carefully pours the ink-blot
of anonymity over the name of the person who is
said to have instigated a much worse offence. It
isn’t the blot itself that is objectionable, but the
tendency to blot one person and not another.

The N.S.W. Lands Commission struck a
desperately cautious witness when it called on
MacFarlane, Under-Secretary for Lands. No
bygone MacFarlane, with his kilt streaming out
in the cold breeze of the 15th century, was more
careful in looking round a damp rock for a hostile
MTherson than was this Under-Secretary. In
fact, even before he appeared cautiously on the
horizon there were signs that he was a careful
kind of man. When it was decided that, instead
of the highest tenderer for a certain block getting
the land, the lowest one—a letter-carrier who
was closely related to a member of Parliament-
should be informed of the highest offer and
allowed to raise his bid accordingly, the Under-
secretary had to make a memo, on the subject,
and it read :
In these cases, as in others which have been dealt with
during the last two years, there is no objection to
allowing the applicants for the offer to bid up to the
highest tender.
After that no one could say that the practice had
been initiated by the cautious Mac. He was
completely hidden behind a precedent The same
wary man, while giving evidence, wouldn’t even
refer to the Commission’s copy of the Land Act,
but sent to his office for his own copy. He knew
his own copy wouldn’t bite, and he didn’t know
exactly how wild the Commission’s copy might
be.

From Sydney Telegraph :
Just after his entrance to the hall a kanaka boy 14
years of age, and weighing 14st., was introduced to the
Prime Minister. Taken by surprise, Mr. Reid put out his
hand mechanically. An instant later HE SAW WHAT
HAD HAPPENED, placed his monocle in position, and
smiled grimly.
Now what in thunder had happened ?

The N.S.W. Lands Commission is begin-
ning to get on the community’s nerves. Even in
its sleep now it hears a voice like a large devil
crying out: “ Who drew that bill for £l5O V ”
The 86 miserable and long-haired Christian
Israelites, who recently left Victoria under
prophets “Mary 5 and “Benjamin, 5 have arrived
in Benton Harbor, U.S.A. They were met by
brass bands and a procession, and escorted to a
banquet of 16 courses—of vegetables. Having
dined heartily on cabbage, peanut and water, they
were lined up to drop their aggregate £37,000 into
the “common fund,” from which it will never
emerge, and after that the married couples were
separated, and told that they were never to asso-
ciate again until the “Second Coming,” which is
expected about 1916. It seems to be a cheerless
religion of loneliness, vegetables, cold water, long
hair, and hope —that hope deferred that makes
the peanut lie heavy on the stomach.

A reminiscence, by “ The Mussel ” :
Vampire Day was probably the most dismal patriotic
observance that ever struck this walloped and knocked-
out earth. Only one ray of light pierced the gloom. In
a restaurant where I am still trusted, a waitress, whose
taking ways, etc., are more fully developed than her
intelligence, asked this question of a sad-eyed cus-
tomer : “ Wot are all the flags flying for to-
day ? Is it the Prince of Wales’ Birthday? „
The depressed client looked hard at her. “No,
said he, “this is his grandmother’s birthday. Then
the girl pondered with the p ate of sausages if) her
hand “ Why do you sav ms ? Isn’t the Prince of Wales
a woman?" she asked. The miserable-looking man nearly
choked himself with a lump of tripe. “ No,” he said,
“ the Prince of Wales is a man.” “Now, don t pull my
le«%”said the fair one. “Ain’t the Prince of Wales a
woman?” turning inquiringly to a rather youthful cus-
tomer. “ Ah, well —er that is to say —er ap-
pearances seems to be against —er —that sort of theory.
You see ‘ Prince ’ stands for the man and ‘ Princess for
the woman.” Then a great dawn of intelligence climbed
slowly over her peach-like features. “Ah ! now I know i
the difference between prince and princess is just the
same as the difference between waiter and waitress.
“ Yanco” : I am a junior public servant,
and being driven to fury by having my pay docked
255. a year in the sacred name of economy, I have
dug out these facts. New South Wales spends
£1960 annually on the religious education of
prisoners in its gaols. Of this amount Darling-
hurst gets £4OO ; Bath-
urst, £200; Berrima,
£2OO ; Biloela, £BO ;
Goulburn, £200; Mait-
land, £6O; and Parra-
matta, £240. The
balance is divided up
amongst 16 country
gaols (some of which
are only police gaols),
and the only subsi-
dised religions minis-
terings to the un-
godly souls who occu-
py these 16 stone gaols
and other domiciles
are the R. C. and C. E.,
which share and share
alike. In 11 of these
16 country gaols each
denomination gets
£2O, in four £lO, and
in one £3O. Yass
Gaol stands alone,
either as a gaol with-
out prisoners or one
without parsons, or
with unpaid parsons. Of
the total £1960 theR.C. and
C.E. denominations each get
£780; the Presbyterians,
£lBO ; Methodist, £170; and
Jewish, £5O.

“ Hamer ” : H. G.
Wells in “When the Sleeper
Wakes,” published in ’96,
makes the Labor Trust, 200
years hence, an organisation
that, in return for a canvas
working uniform, food and
shelter, and a penny or so per
day. holds a third of the
world in slavery, and derives
that state of things from the purchase by the
Trust of the Salvarmy sweating-institution. It
reads like prophecy.

Melb. Argus has taken up the question of
the secret remission of prisoners’ sentences. It
has transpired that the Government has been
sheltering itself behind a provision of the Vic-
torian Crimes Act, under which any prisoner may
be released after serving two years, provided he
leaves the State for good. This provision, which
m i<rht be called a Scheme for Filling Other Aus-
tralian States with Yic. Criminals has been
availed of in many instances during the past ten
years, mostly for the benefit of convicts with influ-
ential relatives in Toorak or friends on the Cham-
ber of Commerce. Another sensational revelation
has been made regarding a number of homi-
cides ordered to be detained during the Gover-
nor’s'pleasure, having been set at liberty within a
year or two of their crimes, indicating that the
Governor is a gentleman very easily pleased. All
these releases have been kept secret, and in some
cases the intimation has even been omitted from
the published lists of discharged prisoners supplied
to the police.

A beautiful instance of simplicity in a
pawnbroker. At South Melbourne Court, the
other day, a 13-year-old girl, whose mother had
been wanting food, was charged with the theft of
a five-stone diamond ring, valued at £35. trie
child’s idea in stealing this first-class piece of pro-
perty—she stole it from the bedroom of a lady
who gave her employment—was to pawn
it for 10s. The kind pawnbroker “lent
her ss. on the ring, because he thought the dia-
monds were paste, he told the magistrates, and
thinking they were paste, he valued them at lus.
Whether he also mistook the gold setting for
brass was not made clear in the newspaper report
of the transaction. If he had troubled to “ clean
it up and examine it” he would have known the
ring was a genuine article. The dirtiness deceived
him, therefore he risked five “bob” on the ring
for the dear child’s sake, finding comfort in the
thought that he who giveth to the poor lendeth to
the Lord. Pawnbrokers are whales for lending to
the Lord.

Fashioned for a lover ;
Little shining head,
Breasts that laces cover,
Whence my reason’s fled.
Eyes—wet violets sleeping ;
Lashes—curling silk ;
Ears like pink shells peeping ;
Dimpled throat, like milk.
Cheeks, just baby roses,
Flushed with swift, shy pink ;
Red mouth just supposes
How a man might drink.
Flowery hands of whiteness,
Most divinely sweet,
Like white doves in lightness—
Little childish feet.
Just a sweet, shy woman,
Where God did His best.
As I’m man and human,

The watchers slept, and then we crept—
All though Care followed as we stept—
Gray-eyes, as softly as a mouse
Until we entered Love his house.
Then were we ware the Dragon Care
Had checked, and could not enter there ;
He threatened, in a fiery din,
Of no avail to enter in.
Now from Love’s latticed spying-pane
We watch the sullen Dragon wane :
And fade, as still we watch him pine,
Our troubles with him, Rose of mine.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
jut . Hydney, June 13, 1905.
My Dear Arini.—
Rupert CJarke had to cut short the idyllic cruise
“.“if Carabine m North Queensland waters.
Jlis brother, who was his fellow passenger, fell ill
and is now in Dr. MacCormaek’s hospital. The
good-natured Rupert is at the Australia, and
buzzes ground considerably in a very buzzy motor.
It sounds like the mosquito which stole a horse
out of an omnibus.
A great favorite and old military and society
vetman, Captain Daveney, died at Auckland
(M.L.) last week. He had been captain in a
crack Irish regiment, and was at the time of his
death paymaster of Imperial pensions. Mrs
Arthur MacArthur, of Sydney, was a daughter of
the deceased officer. Mrs. Todd, of Mosman
was another.
The Euryalus has gone its way over the blown
wet face of the sea, and Sydney girls abhor greatly
the vacuum it has left. “ There is such a dear boy
on board-only 18 it is true—but such a dear ’’
Some women get through life on a limited vocabu-
lary consisting chiefly of “nice,” “dear,” and
on . .Lord Alistair Graham is the youngster.
As the crochet is so recently off his pinnies, he is
too juvenile for matrimonial annexation. All the
same, old parents-o’-war in England must feel
anxious about their small guns on this naval base.
All the unmarried officers of the Torch save one
g<)^et^ g , aged tt J d °b ar t, and the odd one is being
raffled for. Unless a naval man has very ample
private means he cannot afford to marry a girl
who is her own sole asset, and remain in the
service, and bombard the enemy as of old
it he marries a moneyed girl, that’s another story.
A former admiral on this station, when asked by
one of his officers for leave to go to Sydney to
marry, exclaimed, “The Australian girl again!
'j 0 ,’ 81 , r ,' certainly not, sir ! I consider Australian
gmls the curse of the British navy.” Officer
retired but later, in Portsmouth, his choice, Miss
Hilda Robertson, joined him, and they were mar-
ked. Admiral tells the rest of the story himself.
He saw the beau, now commander of the Mutine
who would a-wooing go, dancing with a pretty girl!

Commander Warren Hastings D’Oyley—there’s
a bewitching name for you ! But it’s too long for
the tired Australian. We’ll call him just Anti-
macassar. He is the latest naval arrival, and he
spreads himself on H.M.S. Pegasus, which craft
replaces the Mutine. Sailor-loving Sydney women

If our State Parliament were always as dull as
on its opening ceremony to-day, the Tourist
Bureau might put it on the list of attractions as a
first-class suicide resort. Acting-Governor Dar-
ley was too ill to be present, so the
w tO ,, hIS L cgship Francis Suttor.
Red hats predominated m the Chamber. It is
v? U ! te dlstm " u l , sbe d these days not to own a red
hat. Mrs. and Miss Seddon, of Maoriland, looked
on from the gallery, with Miss Darley. For the
rest, there was nothing worth comment but Mr
Brunker, who made his first appearance as an
Upper House man.
Dr John Mildred Creed, M.L.C. (N.S.W.) in
May last, wedded, as the announcement tells us
the widow of the late ’’ James Williams, of
Queensland. Dr. Creed has been before the N.S. W.
public as a legislator for 33 years. In 1872 he
represented the Upper Hunter in the Legislative
Assembly, and in August, 1885, Alexander Stuart
made him an M.L.C. This bride and groom were
much complimented at the opening of Parliament.
Forty-four more beds are available for patients
through the opening of the new wing of the
Wentworth Falls Consumptive Home 8 There
are also eight shelters donated by different per-
“St „ Carruthers opened the additions
with a gold key, and in “the course of a few re-
marks, said that it was a curious fact that the
first white man buried in Australia had died of
consumption. He was one of Captain Cook’s sea-
men, and his bones rest at Kurnell. (Of course
this is only a politician’s inaccuracy. White men
probably died here of indigestion before Cook’s
grandfather was born, the native spear being a
weapon that almost certainly struck some early
e xpl° rer s m the waistcoat.) A large number of
visitors went up into the clear, cold bril-
hancy of the hill-top for the ceremony, and
were welcomed by Dr. L. Sinclair, who is
in charge of the Home. Dr. Sydney Jones spoke
™ e A a ul mforma ti° n and consumptive statis-
tics. All the same, the Home wants more money
for yet more beds and shelters. The Husrh
Dixsons and the Prestons were among the guests
who had motored put to feel weather that lives up
to the name of winter. Here in Sydney, June is
pretending that it is September. Mrs Dixson it
may be remarked, was the first donor of a
oheque to Dr. Sinclair when the Home was
started. The Prestons seem to have acquired
vogue for the mixed reasons that they made money
have taken Justice Barton’s house
at Kirribilh Point, and own the most powerful
motor car—a 36 li.p. Daimier—in Australia.
Masonic Ball and St. Patrick’s Ball will occur
? n ' kh e same night, July 4. And I notice that
both balls are advertised as under the patronage
of (amongst others) Mr. H. L. Jones, Acting-
Oonsul for America. Nowadays every really
great country wants two consuls, so that one can
go to each ball, and sometimes an automatic brass
consul for handshaking purposes would be advan-
tageous m addition.
Mis 3 Violet Mount, the soprano, who gets
pretty well all the concert work in Sydney, will
leave Australia soon after her musical entertain-
ment m September. South America will pro-
bably be her ultimate aviary.
Comic opera artiste Miss Elsie Moore voyages
presently to the U.S. A. to try her luck. At the
end of this week will occur a swift exodus of
theatricals. Eighty-six members of the Royal
Comic Opera Co. will train to Adelaide, en route
tor Westralia. Mr. Julius Knight, who didn’t
take his typhoid full strength, has so far recovered
as to be able to read with interest a great work by
Cruy Booth by. He will in less than a fortnight’s
time go to Adelaide, to stay with friends at Mount
.Lofty, and he hopes to be ready for the July
season, starting on the 16th. Miss Rose Mus-
grove, who, I am told, attributes her illness to
eating oysters fresh off the rock ” down in some
sunlit cove of peace ” (as Roderic Quinn has it),
is still within the danger zone. The fresh rock
was evidently unhealthy, and her attack is a
virulent one. Miss Alexia Bassian has Sydney’s
sympathy. She is again out of the cast of “ The
Cingalee,” through a recurrence of throat trouble.
Y a ncose vein on one of the vocal chords burst,
and had to be operated on.
Miss Nance O’Neil, considerably slighter and
more youthful-looking than she was four years
ago, came into our blue-and-gold weather on her
way to Melbourne. A huge, black-feathered hat,
navy-blue frock and grey coat formed her stepping-
ashore outfit; and her former companion, Miss
Rucoa Allen, and the white cat, Magda, were not
tar behind. Ihe uncanny-looking black cockatoo
that formed part of her menagerie last trip was
bought by London Zoo.
The grass-green tie—shrill, emerald green—is
being adopted by the smart young man with all
the eagerness with which the old bachelor or
widower adopts the 17-year-old baby-girl. Private
Secretary Share is wearing one; Mr. “Glen-
da 11 Kelly, M.P., has the like ; baritone Haigh
Jackson loses his heart nightly to the Cingalee
with the same seventeenth-of-Ireland color round
his collar. These three blades of grass recently
pervaded the pavement near Jeans’, at a moment
when Mr. Owen Cox’s brougham—his horses
wearing the same tone of green in ear-rosettes
was at the kerb. If the horses had been hungry
they would have come over and eaten the ties for
certain. It is to be hoped that P.S. Share won’t
encounter any starving stock when he is in W.A.
When a flock of sheep cast themselves on the
bosom of a private secretary somebody is almost
certain to be trodden on.
Dental Hospital celebrated its third birthday
with a smart ball last week. It might be called
for short the Tooth Ball. Mrs. W. T. Beckett,
Mrs. C. C Marshall, and Mrs. E. R. Magnus
who are always to the front in the matter of
working for trie bantling institution, surveyed
with satisfaction a gathering of some 300 guests.
Mrs. Marshall brought a snowy-robed debutante
daughter. This free dental institution, like most
charities, wants funds. It has done an enormous
amount of work during the past year, but a great
proportion of the patients have been old persons
who require sets of teeth. And these demand
an actual outlay of money—which the Hospital
hasn t got. Dental experts give their time will-
ingly and unstintedly to the relieving of pain and
to other forms of tooth work, but they can hardly
be expected to buy Darby and Joan’s complete new
apparatus. Someone has been suggesting that the
bloated Dental Board, which has a fund (anything
that has a fund these days lays itself open to the
adjective bloated’ )should assist, so thatprovision
could be made for students at Hospital and School.
Since it hyphenated itself with the Uni. Dental
School twenty chairs instead of only six have been
made available.
The newest acquisition to Rose Bay peacock
society is Dr. Piers-Hatton and his pretty wife-
said to be much his junior. They come from Japan,
are nearly as rich as the Mikado was before the war
and have motor cars, steam launches, and queer
little dogs. Mervyn,” Mr. “Ted” Simpson’s
house, has been secured by them for 12 months.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“The Cliveden dowager has been hearing
strange compliments on her top-scoring in the
Herald list of foremost citizenship. One man
added to his congratulations (?) the sly wheeze-
,,And.l" Sl j c h distinguished company, too ’! And
the widow s suspicions have been exercised ever
since Is there any compliment in being con-
sidered just a little better than Thomas Bent ?
* " X ic i° ria ’ s Gov ? rnor w ent out to the Fleming-
*? n lrr da 7 by s P ecial train. This cost
the State a trifle but saved the nags of Stoning-
ton The crowd that had to wait for the special
to steam off and steam back with the Governor
and his brace of lean caddies (after all, the Aide
is much of a caddie), snorted angrily. It didn’t
see why the race-goer, who paid for his return
trip, and paid through the nose, too, should have
to wait the pleasure of an official who was given a
whole train to himself. Considering that the
Governor has a motor and a much-fined chauffeur
the special tram seems unnecessary.
s ® veral bu lLdred youngsters booked for the
Mayoral Juvenile Hop next Thursday (16th) have
been in toe-trammg for weeks. Two-stepping
small precocious nippers are boasting that they
have their programmes booked up to the Antheni
Children just out of arms have cried to be let down
into the Lancers, and swear in shrill tones to foot
it with the rest. A juvenile hop may be a great
London idea, but there’ll be comfort and peace
for parents when the event has spent its course,
when the unbidden cease from whining, and the
hoppers are at rest.
“ Mrs. S. Rowan (daughter of Surgeon O’Hara)
gave a farewell party last week, preparatory to
steaming home to Bananaland’s wool areas. The
guests were recruited from Toorak, the theatrical
quarter, and the smart set which is rather
Bohemian. Mrs. Rowan is a large breezy matron,
young in years and manner.
“It's just now a close season for river suicides.
Ihe Yarra really ought to be heated to aid the
world-weary, the love-lorn, or the debt-haunted
to a quiet end. The other evening, after sunset,
when grim shadows were stretching over the
Alexandra drive and the city side of Prince’s
Bridge, a wet, shivering mortal crept to the
nearest policeman and said that he didn’t want to
die any more. After a neat dive from the grassy
bank of the Yarra and twice sounding the bottom
of the stream, drowning proved none of the things
it was cracked up to be, and the second time of
rising the wet and greatly chilled suicide clam-
bered out and bolted, urged on by cold and con-
science, to the shelter of the blue arm of the
Law. He was taken into custody to be dried and
tried according to the Act.
“Society has suddenly developed a literary
craving. Mrs. Maudsley, the tall dame of the
Loll ins-street medico who has the beautiful bed-
side manner, runs the ’Varsity Extension Lectures,
and rounds-up all the Toorakites to the harangues.
Moreover, she converts herself into a doorkeeper,
and takes the shillings of the public with a smile
that glorifies the post. On Tuesday last, the little
Independent Hall wasn’t nearly big enough for
the crowd that paid its silver coin for the enter-
tainment. Scattered through a most fashionable
audience were many spectacled ’Varsity grads and
sad intellectual spinsters. Why is there no bright-
ness in the face of the woman who affects literary
taste ?
“Annette Kellermann writes from Suez that the
Ophir passengers were a convivial crew, and that
idleness somehow reduced her weight by 41b.
A Toorak couple have separated for better or
worse without the law’s help; and their friends
have split into two parties over the wrench of the
pair.
• s * ren w h° describes herself as passing fair
in the agony columns of a recent Age, and ‘ a bril-
liant musician, ’ prays for a job. ‘ Bar and pianiste,
suburban hotel.’ Not even a city shrine of
Bacchus —just a side-altar within tram-distance of
the G.P.O. !
Pillow-patters and pill-administrators are
close up to the frolicsome chorus chick as the
rival of the society flutterer. Within the last
month, two of the city’s Nightingales have cap-
tured wealthy patients for better or worse. Toorak
meanwhile sits at home like the Beatrice of the
Bard, and cries ‘ Heigh-ho! for a husband.’
bociety girls have tried hard to beat the chorus
siren with wild frolics and chic frills without
avail. The eligible Johnnie sees more attraction
in the captivating nurse. She represents the
domestic ideal.
“Velvet dresses are in vogue. Long, slim
dreamy-eyed gazelles are rushing them. Romance
and terrace dust always cling to trailing velvet,
and the leaves of (an alleged) memory seem to
make a mournful rustling in that fabric. Silk is
up-to-date and shallow. Satin is bridal. Brocade
is elderly. Velvet alone is heavy with red rapture
or grey grief.
~r < £ hundred smart souls struggled to Mrs.
Wesley Hall s party last Tuesday, at one of the
recently-instituted Todgers establishments. It is
seldom these days that Mrs. W. Hall relieves her
widowhood with a lapse into junketing. The most
interesting young frivollers on the scene were
Miss Alison J airbairn and Miss Greva Stanley—
both just ashore from an ocean liner.
“Melb. Nat. Gallery haunters are gazing these
days on a new large canvas, signed Hare. Two
Christian martyrs to-be (a white beauty and a
brown slave) are lying in a loose, slumbrous
embrace-hands flung over the hips—on a faggot
of straw. A shaft of sunlight (presumably sun-
light) throws the upper parts ®f the two bodies
into brilliant relief. From the darker recess of
the cell the cold, hungry gleam of a lion’s eyes
make a point of light. Two of the hairy monsters
contemplate from behind their bars the toothsome
bodies. The white beauty is big-hipped, long-
limbed somewhat of a young Juno. The expres-
sion of soft and easy sleep is good. Her long
tawny locks ripple from the quiet brows right
over the straw in a cloud. She represents cold,
chaste, splendid strength in an easy dream. The
brown girl is smaller, younger, and lacks the
spiritual air. She sleeps with lips apart in the
Asiatic manner. It’s a striking canvas and might
have been a masterpiece but for the over-emphasis
of shade and the drawing of the white girl’s arm.
As it is, with two or three imperfections, it makes
an attractive and interesting addition to the
Stawell Gallery. And the crowd adores it for its
suggestion of dear Mercia and ‘ Sign of the Cross.’
“LadyLeHunte kept close indoors while at

Only once her charity, or her curiosity, moved her

which. At any rate, that was her one dissipation.
“A motley crowd swarmed about Spencer-
street on last Friday to see Miss Tittell Brune
off. They pushed her, projecting one a
face, one a fist, one a book of verses, another a
bunch of violets, or a baby. V’onderful how
many brought their babies, as if the Yank star
were an actual Jordan and the day specified for
baptisms. In the melee, the kissed and befondled
mummer had her jaunty blue Toreador thrust to a
drunken angle on her ear, her toes trampled on,
and her hands pump-handled till they ached. (I
often think that Great People ought to have a
pump, and it should be understood that two shakes

She is tall, picturesque, and the sort of dressy
deity that demands polite attention. She has been
a petted beauty anyone with normal vision may
see that. Smartest of all the coterie was Miss
JGorrie Gleeson, in a cutty rig of marine blue and
a Siberian toque. Miss Mabel Lane, who stays
behmd for the Nance O’Neil season, saw the co
oft with a toy terrier under her arm. By the wav’
Nance and iittell Brune-two Yank actresses-
had never met till they fell on one another’s neck
at the Children’s Hospital matinee, an hour or
two after their arrival in Sydney.
“The present quartet of beauteous Gum-
Blossoms—the Misses Ruby and Lesly Madden
their cqusin (Miss Geva Stanley), and Miss Alison
x! airbairn have all had their tour abroad and
returned unengaged. This is worth some reflec-
tion. Is the Australienne a slump in the great
markets ? Or is she dissatisfied with the eligibles
met on her leisurely travels, and likely to prefer
the formerly-despised local male product? Only
on ® of the quartet has a romance to her credit,
and that had a sad ending. The other three are
not even burdened with remembrances of what is
lost. Local folk are taking note of things, and
touring is ‘off.’ It costs time, money, trouble, and
ends m nothing.
" A violent wind struck across Moonee Valley
and Saturday’s Oaklands Hunt muster, and
thrashed the sides of the straining tents. But the
Valley remained where it was, the tents stood to
their pins, and the crowd stuck to its clothes. The
little Toorak clan that is coaxed to the Valley
meetings by the Miller proprietors had made
themselves trim and taut against the stormy hour,
none with more effect than Miss Jean Langtree,
who was as neat a clipper as ever faced a blus-
tering wind.
“ The Miller idea of separating the sheep from
the goats (I say nothing of the kid section, always
a factor at these meetings) when tea-time comes
round, fails every time. A tremendous effort is
made to round up the Cream and hurry it into the
scones before the Skimmed Milk learns that the
billy’s boiling. But somehow the Skimmed Sort
gets along to the tent early and gains the enclosure
in good time for the first brew of tea. Fancy the
every-day race-goer and his missus lapping up the
first brew, while a remnant of the Toorak clans
stands around the reserve waiting for its turn
after the Early Savages !
“There were gay and frolicsome dresses in the
foremost Princess pews for the start of ‘Bill
Adams on Saturday night. Banker Urquhart’s
dame led in scarlet raiment and Egyptian thatch
ornaments of Cleopatra order. Mrs. Ernest
Raleigh and Mrs. St. Leger Robertson also called
attention to their brilliantined coils by bright
back-hair clasps and decorative skewers. The rear
part of the fashionable head suggests fierce yard-
broom brushings—it is so thoroughly well swept
U P mto the top upholsterings. The stray tendrils
that once dallied around a fair neck and softened

"An awkward thing has occurred in connection
with an art competition in a country town.
-f he landscape painting which was awarded
by Melbourne Art judges the first prize was
found, after the exhibition, to closely resemble
a sketch in a British magazine. The local gal-
committee in haste corresponded with the
Melbourne critics. The result was that all the
other pictures in that class of the exhibition were
conveyed to town for a second review, and the
prize-winner lost the landscape medal.
“The movement organised in Melbourne to
stop the war may now be regarded as a failure.
Nine people in all formed themselves into a com-
mittee to appeal to the two combatants to cease
hitting each other, and those nine attempted to
organise a demonstration at the Town Hall.
If the event had come off, and resolutions
had been passed to the effect that Mr. Ivan and
Mr. Yamagata ought to go home again at once,
R probable that neither of those angry and
combustible persons would even have heard of it.
But the event didn’t come off, and the committee
had to pass round the headgear and take up a
collection to pay for the gas.
Yours Affectionately,

CURED OF NEURALGIA
After Years of Torture by Or. Williams’ Pink Pills.
“ nV'TO one under Heaven ever had Neuralgia
IX] worse than I had. It wore me down to
1 ll a wreck, and drove me to the very
verge of madness. When Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills cured me, they can cure the
worst case of Neuralgia in this world. There’s
no doubt about that.” This is the solemn, sworn
statement of Mrs. Margaret Purkis, Thorne and
Forsyth streets, Newtown, Wagga Wagga.
“I used to be a plump, healthy woman till
my blood got out of order,” said Mrs. Purkis.
“Before long my nerves broke down—and then
the Neuralgia started. Sharp, burning pains
nagged and dragged at my nerves till I writhed
and screamed with the agony. The pains in my
head were just like stabs from red-hot table-
knives. For weeks I could get no rest. One bad
attack lasted for four months. All this time I lay
paralysed with pain. I could not move from my bed.
“The agony was so terrible that I nearly
lost my reason,” Mrs. Purkis continued. “It
was only from sheer exhaustion that I ever
slept. I could not eat solid food at all.
Every time I opened my mouth, a piercing
pam tore through my head and face till
every nerve seemed on fire. Even when the
neuralgia was not nearly as bad as it often was,
there were days when I could not leave my bed
through weakness and pain. People would come
in and go out of the house and I would never
know they were there. At times I seemed lo
be unconscious of everything but my terrible
fiendish sufferings. At other times I was so
irritable that I could not bear the children near
me. If they walked across the floor every foot-
step sent a fresh spasm of pain through me.
“All my housework had to be left undone,”
Mrs. Purkis added. “ I had to depend upon the
kindness of the neighbors to do whatever was
absolutely necessary. When I was well enough
to leave my bed, the neuralgia had so drawn up
the nerves of my arm that I could not raise it to
comb inv hair. I used to rave up and down the
room like a maniac, frantic with pain. For a year
I hardly ever had my head out of flannels. I tried
all kinds of medicines, but nothing was of any use.
Ordinary treatment failed even to ease the pains.
My case baffled doctors and everyone else.
“I was worn to a wreck when one day my little
girl brought me home a book telling how Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People cured
Neuralgia. It said they actually made new blood
—and that good red blood was really the food of
the nerves." The cases they had really cured were
just like my own, only not so bad—so I picked up
heart, and sent to Williams’ the chemist in Fitz-
maurice-streefi*for a supply of these blood-building
pills.
‘ ‘ The very first box gave me a better appetite
than I had had for months,” Mrs. Purkis con-
cluded. “Soon I noticed my nerves were a bit
steadier. Gradually the color came back to my
cheeks and new strength to my legs. I began to
biighten up and look after my house again. The
children’s noise no longer worried me and I gained
in weight. Before long two or three days would
pass and I wouldn’t have a twinge of Neuralgia.
At last I was completely cured. Now I tell
everyone that when Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
cured me, they can cure anybody.”
Mrs. Purkis’ case is only one of hundreds.
Among your own neighbors you will find cases
just as wonderful, in which Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills have struck at the root of other blood
diseases* like anaemia, indigestion, rheumatism,
sciatica, backache, kidney diseasd, liver complaint,
headaches, and the special-secret sufferings of
growing girls and women when the regularity of
their blood-supply is deranged. Kemember,
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills do not act on the bowels...
Thev do one thing only, but they do it well—they
actually make new blood. If you are not sure
whether your special trouble is caused by bad
blood or not, write for free medical advice to the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney. From.the
same address you can order the genuine Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills by mail—2s. 9d. a box, s;x
boxes 15s. 3d., post free.

0. C. Kingston has been well enough to
get up a few times lately from liis breezy home at
Marino to his office in Adelaide.
As gaud Mayor of Melbourne Sam Gillott
became Gil-lott. Present Mayor Pleasance is now
Pleas-owicc. Seems to be a fatality about it.
Randolph Bedford has sold English pub-
lisher Heinemann an Australian novel, “ Strength
and the Snare.”
H. L. Ayers’ will has been lodged at
Adelaide for probate, value £86,000. The dead
man was son of Henry Ayers, who was seven
•times Premier and ten times Chief Secretary of
South Australia, and subsequently President of
■the Legislative Council for 12 years.
S. Australia, which is vigorously firing out
from its public service everybody suspected of
being 65, sent three septuagenarians to Parliament
the other day—Burgoyne,,7B ; Gilbert, “father of
the House,” 76; and Sellar, 74.
The reodntly-deceased Captain Charles G.
Clark (he died aged 77), who acted as shipping
reporter .for Melbourne Age from ’54 to 90, was
the son df a naval officer who was on board the
Northumberland during her voyage from England
to St. Helena with Napoleon Bonaparte.
Some of (those law-writers were funny
■dogs. Thus Pollock on the “Law of Torts”
■(fifth edition, page 236) :
It is actionable to charge a barrister witli being a dunce,
or being ignorant of the law ; but not a justice of the
peace, for he need not be learned.
Queensland Lands Minister Bell is re-
garded by all parties as the drone of the Govern-
ment. He takes country trips on the slightest
pretext while departmental work accumulates.
The pile of papers on his desk grows daily, and
will soon obscure him from view altogether.
Archdeacon Giinther, of Parramatta (N.S.
Wales) is said to have declined more bishoprics
than any other Anglican preacher in Australia.
Hd was an old Parramatta schoolboy, and has
spent most of his life as incumbent in the sleepy
town. He often says he will close his days at his
present post. The Parramattans call him the
Citizen Bishop.
CHIEF JUSTICE WAY, OF S.A.
An attempt to dig up some of the half-
forgotten remains of ancient Groperdom is likely
to be the next move in Westralian politics.
Already voices from the remote past are heard
insinuating that Forrest and Throssell. and Lefroy
and Illingworth, and Venn are ready to come to
the rescue of their country with a very small
amount of encouragement.
James Norton, M.L.C., the Nestor of
Sydney solicitors, is son of the James Norton,
also M.L.C., who published a remarkable book in
London in 1857. In that volume he described
the aldermen of Sydney as “low-minded, and
unprincipled persons.” And even that wasn’t the
most violent remark in the book.
Archdeacon Tyrrell, who died in a private
hospital the other day at 78 years of age, was
nephew, and not brother, as stated, of Dr. Tyrrell,
first Bishop of Newcastle. The Bishop left a
quarter of a million to the church, but most of it
melted in bad speculations, and droughts. Nephew
Tyrrell never tried to stack up money like uncle.
The great Haynes family doesn’t lack
confidence. Brother Dick, K.C., in Perth the
other day, before Justice Parker began his
summing-up in a big case, cheerfully handed up■ a
paper containing “a few points of law” that he
would like him to remember. And Justice
Parker contented himself with rebuking Richard
with a very mild rebuke.
Joe Darling will only receive £2OOO under
the will of his father, who left £67,000, but he has
had the Tasmanian sheep-station already. Brother
John, who wouldn’t be Premier of S.A. when he
had the chance, and now hasn’t the chance, is to
get £lO,OOO. There were eight childreu. John
and Joseph are joint trustees.
Book-Arcade Cole boasts that he has
issued over 1,000,000 pamphlets, etc., against the
White Australian “ fallacy. One would think
that a man who had done his best to make his
country a nation of half-castes would want to
keep the fact quiet. But there’s no accounting
for the taste of the person who looks forward to a
Heaven modelled on the plan of Little Bourke*
street.
Thos. H. Thwaites, father of the engineer-
in-chief of Melbourne Board of Works, has just
celebrated his 80th birthday. He arrived in Mel-
bourne in March, ’42, and carried on business with
his father as a cabinet-maker. The first furniture
manufactured by the firm was made in John Bat-
man’s kitchen. Now the trade has shifted from
the white man’s kitchen to the Chinaman s bed-
room.
Captain Dumaresq, of Longford (l as.), on
Saturday last passed into his 104th year. The
captain, whose pedigree would equal a Gippsland
tree if stood on end, was originally in the Bombay
Army, but was appointed Surveyor-General of
Van Diemen’s Land in 1826, also Commissioner of
the Court of Requests.
Royalism in Europe promises to die
naturally of social scandals without waiting to be
decently buried alive. The latest Princess to get
into discreditable print is a Bourbon lady,
daughter of Don Carlos. She was “keeping
house ” with an Italian artist, and the incident of
a bullet being lodged in the artist has attracted
attention to the circumstance.
Died at Adelaide, recently, Rev. James
Gordon, aged 88, father of Justice Gordon. He
was born in Dumfries, Scotland, and studied for
the Presbyterian Church at Edinburgh Univer-
sity. In 1858 he came to S.A. as Presbyterian
minister for Mount Barker, and three years later
heard a voice calling him to Gawler, where he
remained until his retirement from the preaching
industry in 1898.
Parson Lorimer Fison lias been awarded a
pension of £l5O per year by the British Govern-
ment in recognition of his services to the science
of anthropology. Mr. Fison joined the Wesleyan
Church in the very early 70’s, and spent 20 years
missionising in Fiji. He has published many
articles on the Fijians and their customs, and has
been for some years editor of the Methodist
newspaper.
Some of the recent large army of candidates
for the Victorian police force were candid. One
wrote to an M.L.A. for a testimonial, urging, as a
reason therefor, “ If I don’t get into the force this
time I see nothing but hard work before me for
the rest of my life.” He got his reference, but it
didn’t pass him. Another confessed having put
down his religion as “ Church of England,” be-
cause he couldn’t spell “ ‘ Presbyterian ’ on the
spur of the moment.”
James Marshall, M.L.C., one of Seddou’s
fossils in the Upper House, is alluded to by a
Maoriland writer as a lineal descendant of Kenneth
M‘Alpine, first King of Scotland. But Kenneth
M‘Alpine is only a shade less legendary than the
40 Scotch kings from Fergus MacEarc to Fergus
MacFerchard, also Kings Selvach, Drostan,
Angus Mac Fergus, Constantine, Grig, and other
kilted specks and trifles of the dim, dim past.
James Gormly, M.L.C. (N.S.W.), testi-
monialised by his old Murrumbidgee constituents,
the other day, brought a beautiful brogue to Aus
tralia 64 years ago, and still keeps it. He was
three years old then, and was droving before he
was 10. He is a teetotaller and a non-smoker. In
the Gundagai flood of ’52, when 100 lives were
lost, all the Gormly family, save two, were
drowned. At one time, when carrying the mails
between Riverina towns, Mr. Gormly employed
the Tichborne Claimant to drive one of his coaches.
British Prime Minister Balfour’s grand-
father was an army contractor in India, and was
for a time suspended for taking tips from the
rajahs. He made £300,000 in four years, and then
returned to Scotland, where he married a daughter
of the Earl of Lauderdale. He is still remembered
in the Highlands with hatred because of the
farmers he evicted to make the deer forest of
Strathconan in Ross-shire—something after the
fashion of the execrated William the Conqueror,
when he planned out his New Forest.
The first solicitor admitted in Victoria—
then Port Phillip—was Frederick Lord Clay, who
arrived at Melbourne in 1840, and was admitted to
practise on May 8, 1841. On the same day Henry
Field Gurner was admitted ; he was a Sydney
native who had served his articles as a clerk in the
N.S.W. Supreme Court, and who subsequently
became Crown Solicitor. Mr. Clay returned to
England in 1877, intending to settle in Derbyshire,
where the Derbyshire neck comes from.
“Tip”: The late J. J. Shillinglaw lost
his position as Government Shipping Master in
Melbourne through not being able to control his
temper when the autocratic Jas. M'Culloch was
dressed in a little sudden and violent authority.
For a while J.J.S. was reduced to living in the
Immigrant’s Home. Speaking of this period, he
once said to me : “ I descended into hell.” It was
the late Chief Justice Stawell (when Acting-
Governor) who secured Shillinglaw’s return to the
Government service after seven years’ absence, by
obtaining for him a position in the Health
Department.
A very old Sydney name, Rundle, was
changed into Perkins at St. Mary Abbotts, Ken-
sington, London, on April 29. The bride is grand-
daughter of the late Jeremiah Brice Rundle,
M.L.C. The first Rundle (Nehemiah) was an
auctioneer in Pitt-street and King-street in the
early 40’s, and J. B. Rundle, senr., was, in the
late 40’s, a merchant in Queen’s Place with a
private residence in Elizabeth-street. This gentle-
man, who was the M.L.C., was subsequently in
partnership with F. H. Dangar in Clarence-street.
The Rundles have a big interest in station property
and in hrieks and mortar in Sydney, and a strange
habit of being christened something ending in
“’miah” or “’kiah.”
A GUIDE TO LAND SETTLE-
MENT IN N.S.W.
Being an impression gained from the evi-
dence before N.S.W. Lands Commission.
NOTE. — The shaded area is owned by, or mort-
gaged to, Mr. W. N. Willis and other land
agents. The balance, if not privately owned, is
open for settlement.
Mackey, one of the “ honorables ” in the
Bent Ministry, is chief wire-puller in that shaky
concern. His functions are to supply Thomas
with facts, jokes, and impromptu epigrams, out of
which the bulky Bent sometimes evolves a genuine
bit of unconscious humor. Mackey, a lawyer who
used to be a type-setter in the Government Print-
ing Office, began his political career with an
attempt at the South Melbourne seat, where his
strongest advocacy was for a land-tax. When he
stood for West Gippsland the land-tax was thrown
overboard and woman’s suffrage, or some other
mild thing, was substituted.
At last Sydney University examination for
M. degree two women sat, both of whom had
married since they took their 8.A.. and both of
whom had successfully read up for the higher pass
in the intervals between darning socks. One, Mrs.
Armitage, had also acquired two children in the
interval; the other, Mrs. Austin, a grand daughter
of Henry Clarke, for years the “father” of
N. Assembly, travelled across from Adelaide
for the exam. She, these times, helps her husband
run a little up-country Congregational church in
S. Australia.
Anti-Socialistic Melbourne recently pur-
chased a huge metal casket to be presented to
Malcolm M‘Eacharn, as a token of sympathy in
the matter of his defeat by Labor member Dr.
Maloney. But M'Eacharn went to England, and
he was so long away that a message was sent
at last asking whether the metal trunk should
be posted to him. Now a glad cable has come
saying, “Retain casket.” This evidently means
that Malcolm will be back soon tef view things
with alarm, and announce that the time is now
ripe. Malcolm has evidently had it forced upon him
that he is only one of the multitude in England.
In that country knights grow on .trees, and the
papers hardly think it worth while chronicling
their deaths when they are run over by omnibuses.
S. Aus. Assembly will re-elect Speaker
Jenkin Coles as a matter of course —it has been
doing it as a matter of course for nearly 15 years
now. There have only been five Speakers m S.
Aus. altogether. C. C. Kingston’s father sat in
the chair for 18 years ; his longest term was
years, and Coles will only have to stay there till
the beginning of next year to beat that record.
Coles used to be a police-trooper, and 20 years ago
he was a member of the famous 36ft. Ministry. It
was a hardy Ministry as well as a long one, for the
only member of it who isn’t still alive and in poli-
tics was John Colton, the Premier. Kingston
was Attorney-General, Senate President Baker
Minister of Education, and Senator Tom Playford
Commissioner of Works; and the Treasurer, Ben
Rounsevell, won a State seat the other day.
A Vic. pressman on Bent:—
It would appear that Bent of Victoria is anxious to out-
do George Reid for pride of place as Australia’s champion
heavy-weight humorist. Bent’s oratory is of the playful
sort that suggests a Clydesdale carthorse in its lighter
moments, and its grotesqueness always excited merri-
ment but of late Thomas has gathered in the flattering
conviction that it is his wit that fills the halls with mad
law-liter, and he laboriously spreads himself to be more
so. ° The' resulting exhibition must be painful to Bent’s
friends, if he really has any ; it is certainly meat and
drink to his enemies. As a humorist, Bent travels on his
stomach even to a larger extent than G. H. Reid. He is
always thrusting it forward, and dragging it into conver-
sation, and his pride in it is obvious, although it is really
something in the nature of an ailment. For the rest, his
idea of humor is a coarse remark about intestines and
bears, delivered in a coarse voice, but with such a
sprightlj air on the speaker’s part of having said a neat
thin"- that the audience always laughs long and loud.
There is some real danger of Bent retaining a position in
public favor, as Reid has, by reason of being an “ amoosin’
cuss ” Australians love to have their politics relieved
with comic spots, and they like the spots to be large-
something in the nature of grease spots, in fact.
Apropos “General” Booth.
Judge Dowling, of more or less
humorous memory, presiding at
a Court of Quarter Sessions —
which are never held quarterly—
at Parramatta (N.S.W.), was once
presented with a pair of white
gloves, there being no cases on the
list. He inquired to what the clean
record was attributable, and the
Crown Prosecutor ascribed it to the
Salvation Army. “I don’t see that
the Army has made much improve-
ment in the Crown Prosecutor, at all
events,” said Dowling'. It lias never
been decided whether this was a brilliant
joke or not. The Crown Prosecutor
thought it over all the rest of his life,
and his executors are still considering
it.
From a Vic. up-country correspondent :
An old bachelor named George Stephenson, of an
appropriately mechanical turn of mind, who a few months
ago was arrested at Heyfield, Gippsland (Vic.), on a
charge of lunacy, because he refused to eat anything,
died lately in Kew Asylum. He left £441 ; and in his old
district they tell with a wink that he got some of it for
making the armor of bushranger Ned Kelly. Ned Kelly's
mother, brother, and married sister and her children still
live at Greta, in the north-east of Vic. Kate Kelly has
been dead seven or eight years; she married, and one of
her children goes to the local school.
“The Mussel” writes about a man of
girth :
Every public man has to suffer the penalty of great-
ness—the penalty being the irresponsible criticism of
minds nurtured in a very narrow cradle. For example,
take the case of Thomas Bent, Premier of Victoria.
Tommy has never addressed a hostile meeting yet where
he has not been anxiously cross-examined as to the where-
abouts of a certain missing mace, lie has been ques-
tioned re this implement so often that he must almost
believe himself that there is something in the story,,
though, as a matter of fact, a mace would be no earthly
good to plant vegetables with. The other day I overheard
a man reading aloud the newspaper account of the
Waranga murder (the case where a man was chopped up,
placed in two sacks, and thrown into an irrigation
channel). He remarked: “This looks like Bent’s work.
I wouldn’t put it past him. He was up that way a little-
while ago.” But I think I reached the climax of calumny
the other day in regard to the said T.B. It was the usual
bar-room discussion re Japs and Russians. One man said :
the Russian strike was not nearly' such a serious matter
as the Victorian maritime strike. “Look what
Bent did,” said he; “he said ‘fire low and
lay’em out.’” The other man said it was Tom Price.
Then the trouble started. The disputants were
forcibly ejected into the dimly-lit right-of-way, and for
some minutes the air was over-charged with muffled
curses, gloomy, whirling figures, and bits of human
meat. After the affair was over, the conqueror and the
vanquished drank amicably together, the vanquished
apologising for supposing for one instant that it was Tom
Price who gave that famous order. Bent came out very
badly in this “discussion.”
N.S.W. Lands Minister Ashton, speaking
at Gorowa, stated that he had been pondering
deeply of late over some of the difficulties attend-
ing closer settlement, with the result that “he
had evolved a scheme whereby the project could
be promoted on a satisfactory basis without the
Government taking an active part in it.” His
novel idea was that “the people should deal
directly with owners of large estates, and the
Government would find the capital and become
the mortgagors.” Ashton really didn’t seem to
know that his brilliant scheme already existed as
a provision of the Victorian Act, which empowers
the Closer Settlement Board to finance private
purchasers where it is satisfied that transactions
are bona fide.
THE POPULARITY OF A “TRAINED”
ANIMAL.
Mr. Reid is apparently popular in Queensland, and his
visit has not been unexpected. At Clifton, a town of
mushroom growth, a band of rugged-looking farmers-
crowded around the carriage window, to the accompani-
ment of exclamations such as “There’s ’im,” “That’s-
Georgey,” “ Throw ’im a nut, an’ wotch ’im scratch
’isself,” &c., &e.

Ballarat is troubled about an ancient of
82, named John Alpin, a mining pioneer of the
early ’so’s. Recently the police found him camped
dangerously close to a flooded creek near Black
Hill, East Ballarat, and advised him to move. He
explained that he had come from the Colac dis-
trict to search for several bags of gold left behind
at that place by diggers in the early days, and de-
clined to shift. Later on some of his friends
arrived from Beech Forest, and forced him
to go home with them, but in a few days he
was back again at his camp by the creek, which
was still flooded and liable to engulf him at any
time, and when the police tried to coax him to go
home, and stay there, he ended the discussion
cheerfully but firmly: “Why shouldn’t I be al-
lowed to work if I want to ? There’s years of work
in me yet, and I want that ton of gold.”

“C.X.G.”: There died at Innamincka
Station (S.A.), some two months ago, an old
nigger named Pompey, who must have been nearly
a hundred years old ; also a gin who was reckoned
by the natives old enough to have been Pompey’s
mother. I reckon she was all of 120 years. Mr.
Walker, the manager of the station, has an intelli-
gent nigger now between 50 and 60 years old.
This fellow was a lad of 20 at the time King (of
the Burke and Wills party) was camped at Tnna-
minclca, and he says Pompey used to carry King
about when the latter was too feeble to walk.
According to him, Pompey was then a “ flour-
bag”—i.e., white-headed. Now niggers do not go
properly “flour-bag” until between 50 and 60
years old. King was found in 1863 ; that’s 42
years ago, so that nigger must have been close on
the century, and the female considerably over it.
A sure sign of extreme old age with the nig., is
that his teeth get worn down almost level with
the gums through eating nardoo and ether rough
grain foods.

THE REV. M‘CLUSKY : “ Eh, mon, but I trust

“Barchain”: “ Falder ” (B. l/6/’O5) is
wrong in saying that one of Tyson’s bullock-
teams drew 22 tons at Narrabri. The heaviest
load drawn by Tyson’s teams was 10 tons. But
Terbutt’s drew 18 tons 2 cwt. from Glenroy to
Narrabri, 40 miles, with 22 bullocks (102 bales
greasy wool); Rolling’s drew over 17 tons 18cwt.
from Burren to Narrabri, 70 miles, with 18 horses
(101 bales greasy). These weights are nett, and
are the heaviest loads that ever came to Narrabri.
The biggest loads drawn to Narrabri were 107, 110
and 115 bales of scoured undumped wool, all from
120 and 140 miles out. They were drawn by
Lambkin, with a horse team, the weight of the 115
bales being only 12 tons 12 cwt nett. These
loads were all drawn over heavy black-soil plains.

“Janor”: He divining-rod. Some years
ago mate and self had done much futile loaming
and trenching for the reef at the head of a likely
gully, in which some nice slugs had been got.
The quest had us fairly beaten, when my mate (a
superstitious Cornishman) tramped in to the
nearest mining camp to bring out a local rod-
expert. I was sceptical, and, to give the diviner
a show, I planted three sovereigns in different
parts of the surface. The rod-man cut a forked
twig and, holding it in the orthodox manner,
went marching around. I took care that he
passed over the hidden coins, but the rod gave no
sign. He pronounced the ground not auriferous,
pocketed his fee, and departed. Mate wanted to
break camp and try elsewhere, but when I
showed him the sovs. lie thought he’d interview
the seer instead. He did, and it cost him a fiver
next court-day for assault. We gave the gully
another trial, and inside a month found a reef
carrying good gold in the area that had been
rodded.

“ Ratatat ” : During the drought there
was much talk of the “silent bush ” out west, but
there is no silence now. Birds of every variety
abound, and in parts of the Barcoo galahs are
causing trouble by perching in flocks of thousands
on the telegraph wires, and bearing them down in
places to within nine feet of the ground. The
birds don’t merely perch ; they swing, hang head
downwards, and cut all sorts of capers, causing
crosses ” and other disarrangements. Two wires
out of four on the same poles have been useless for
some time, and the Department is puzzled to find
a remedy for this state of things. The experiment
is to be tried of setting the wires on the same cross-
arm for a distance of nine miles, but already the
trouble has shown in other places, so that galah
parrots may cause a radical change in the method
of building telegraph lines in the backblocks.

at least a trickle of water for that distance in Aus-

“ C.C.H.”: This happened when I was
putting in a few days with my old friend, Jim
Bradley, who keeps a wayside pub. The first
night I was there Jim and I talked over old times
and skited a bit, no doubt; also we
sampled some of Jim’s whisky. Next
morning ! awoke with a head that
was trying to jump four ways at
once. I only mention this that it
may be understood that Jim’s whisky
was none of your milk-and-water
stuff. About 10 o’clock, when my
head was beginning to ease up a bit,
a waggon attached to a team of bul-
locks, their driver, and a man on
horseback pulled up in front of Jim’s.
They came in (the bullock-driver and
horseman), and immediately got to
work on whisky. They drank pretty
consistently till about noon, then went
out, drove round to a small paddock
at the rear of Jim’s, and unyoked.
They came back and settled down
again to whisky. As the afternoon
wore ©n they began to eye each other
suspiciously. At last Tom (that was
the horseman) said Joe (the bullocky)
was drunk. Then Joe bet Tom that
he was good enough to yoke up his
bullocks and drive to Barker’s that
night. _ Barker’s is another bush pub,
four miles further on the road—a road
constantly intersected by old roads
made by the early splitters. Tom took
the bet up. Joe went away, a trifle
unsteadily, but he had the bullocks
yoked and standing in front of the
door in half-an-hour. He came into
the bar, where Tom had sunk quietly
to sleep. Joe had another whisky,
picked Tom up, and dropped him in the
bottom of the waggon, tied Toni’s horse
on behind, and started for Barker’s.
About an hour after dark a waggon stopped at the
front door, and a voice we knew came in to us :
“Get up, you drunken swine! Here’s Barker’s!
I’m dry—dry as ’ell with a north wind blowin’—
and that quid’s got ter be changed pretty quick ! ”
I am not going to try and describe the look of dis-
gust on Joe’s face when Jim and I fell out of the
door—we had been having some more of Jim’s
whisky—and he recognised us.

“Civ” : Can any Bulletin reader “place ”
herewith-described bird, which was caught in a
rabbit-trap near Chiltern (Vic.)? Side view like
eaglehawlc, both in shape and color, but front-face
like an owl’s, with a covering of brown, hair-like
feathers and a thin line of black leathers encircling
it. Breast-feathers, yellow, with black spots;
back, dark brown and black. Talons like hawk.
About 12in. high and 3ft. across extended wings.
Lives on rabbits and parrots, which it tears to
pieces and devours greedily. Don’t break out
into any frivolity and suggest that the thing is a
cross between an emu and a money-lender, for it
isn’t.

“Helen”: I once saw a strange, com-
pound-looking object on the limb of a tree, and
on inspection found it to be a jackass with half
the body and both legs of a half-grown minah
sticking out of his mouth. He seemed to be in
difficulties and was breathing heavily. For two
hours he remained in the tree and wrestled with
the too-vast orb of his dinner, and at the end of
that time the minah’s legs were still visible. In
about another hour Jack began to laugh in an apo-
plectic voice; he had swallowed the legs and feet
and was trying to brighten up.
A THING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SAID DIFFERENTLY.
HE : “Whisky and soda, please.”
SHE: “ What whisky would you like?”
HE: “I think I'd like to try some of your bulk.”
“San Remo”: Should like some Bul-
letin reader to place our venomous snakes in
their order of deadliness. Common bush belief
gives the black snake next place to the death-
adder. Yet the brown snake is deadlier than the
black, and the “ tiger,” in my opinion, ranks next
to the adder. Again, does any Bullet n reader
know of an adult dying from Australian snake-
bite within an hour ? I have witnessed three adult
deaths from bite. One (adder) in Ihr. 30min. ;
another (brown snake) jin three hours ; the third
(black snake) in about five hours. The two litter
cases wouldn’t have been fatal if proper treatment
had been available. Marvellous is the ignorance
on this point that still exists in the bush. To fill
the patient with whisky and run him up and down
is about all that is ever thought of.

Billy Murphy was a little sweet on Kitty
Caiey ; so when Mrs. Casey came upon him lean-
iug over the yard rails, watching Kitty
milk, and cordially invited him in to tea,
he gladly accepted. At tea the Casey
family sat around the table eating nothing,
but watching carefully as Mrs. Casey
pressed scones on Billy. “ Ate a bit, Billy ;
do ate a bit,” she said. Billy felt shy
at eating alone, but could not refuse the
hospitality. Presently Mrs. Casey in-
quired earnestly: “Don’t ye feel bad,
Billy ? ” “ No,” was the wondering reply.
“Then it must a bin crame o’ tarther,”
she said ; and the family looked visibly
relieved. Then Kitty explained. “We
got the arsenic and crame o’ tarther tins
mixed,” she said ; “ we didn’t know which
one we used for ther scones” “So
we arsked yer ter tea, Billy,” said a
younger Casey. “It muster bin the
crame o’ tarther,” added Kitty, with satis-
faction. “I ’ope ter Cord it wuz,” cried
Billy, as he bolted home for an emetic,
while the Caseys with the force of a burst-
ing dam started into the scones.

Sydney Centennial Park has a col-

Noticeable features of the cross are that
the hybrids lose the buff head-marks of
their wild parent, and have yellowish
red feet; and the males have the curly
tail feathers of the house duck. Recently
at a Riverina show hybrids of common

“The Prooshan”: Know an
old prospector who once owned
a pup that went strong on
novelties in the way of vic-
tuals and drink. One night
after work, a few ounces of
quicksilver were lying un-
der the table, in the pro-
spectingdish, with a little
water. Tobias came in
thirsty and made for the
dish, and, after lapping
up the water, lie tried
to polish off the mer-
cury —with poor re-
sults, of course. Re-
tiring a step, the pup
cocked his eye on one
side, in the manner
of Mark Twain’s
blue jay, and, after
quizzing the silver
for fully a minute,
hetackled it again,
lapping harder
than ever. This
went on for a
quarter of an
hour, when the
pup found his
tongue worn
out and began
to whine, and
finally to bark
at the dish.
till it was put
out of his
reach. About
a week later
wash - up oc-
curred ; and
the diggers
panned off the
rough, bringing home
about an ounce and a half
of gold in alittle black sand.
This was put under the bunk in the dish.
While the men were out of the hut, that pup
came in and scoffed the gold. A council of war
decided on certain strong medicines, which were
administered in large doses, and Toby was tied
up for assay purposes. Next day they gave
Tobias to the baker, and the camp knew him no
more. It hopes to continue that way.

“ Ramotli Gilead”: The yarn which
“Wethos” (B. l/G/’Oo) tells about drovers using
the hike to follow their flocks has been defunct
and buried this good while. “ Wethos ” must be
a body-snatcher. In the outer-back, where, if it
does rain at all, it rains every other day, it would
be impossible for anyone to ride a bike after stock ;
not to mention the details of getting through grass,
from 3ft. to Bft. high, over uneven ground and
across creeks where there are no bridges, etc.
And fancy scurrying on a bike, on a pitch-dark
night, through a belar scrub, too thick to hear a
dog bark in, over to Maloney’s to report; or
running down into a bend thick with dead timber,
to explore for a camp. The only time when bikes
were employed at all by drovers (and then very
little) was during the recent severe drought, when
there wasn’t a blade of grass for a thousand miles,
and all the gullies and hills had blown away.

“ 'Struth, Bill, that cove over

flowers."
“Paul Cupid”: About snake-charming.
Once, when a boy, I saw a black snake crawl
under the slab flooring of a shed. An old man
was working for us—a man whom some evil genius
had prompted to play the concertina. I asked
him to come and shift some slabs. “Don’t want
ter shift no slabs t’ get ’itn,” he said. “ Bring me
th’ concertiner, an’ I’ll fetch him out quick. You
get a stick an’ look out on th’ side what I’m
playin’at.” I didn’t think the snake would be
foolish enough to come out, for the aged incubus
was a barbarous player, and I had often seen our
cat spring up from the fire and rush out with its
tail bristling like the Emperor William’s mous-
tache when he started. Ha always used to shut
his eyes when tearing shrieks out of the instru-
ment. He sat on a box on the slabs, closed his
eyes, as usual, and started “The Rocky Road to
Dublin.” I went to the opposite end of the shed
and expected every moment to see the snake fly
for its life. The music attracted the dog. He
came up, sat on his tail behind the player, and,
pointing his nose to the skv, howled like a lost
cornet in Tophet. Then I saw about two feet of
the snake come up through a crack, between the
old man’s legs. He opened his eyes just then and
also saw the snake, and promptly took a back
somersault on top of the dog. The dog limped
away yelping ; the ancient put his foot through
the concertina as he scrambled up, and the con-
certina yelped. Then he cursed fluently at me for
not standing where he told me. In the general
confusion the snake left.

DAD (from outback, at the Zoo): “ That's what

BILL : “ Hogan's ghost! Reckon the cove what

“ Vulcan ” : The public should jump hard
ontheN.S.W. Land Commission’s sliding scale
of allowances to witnesses. Value of a witness,
as a witness, doesn’t lie in the position he : holds or
the work he performs, but in what he has to say
on the matter in hand ; and in giving members of
the professions a guinea per day (with an extra ss.
to a guinea per day for country witnesses), whilst
it-runs down the scale to from ss. to 7s. 6d. (with
from 2s. to 3s. extra for country witnesses) for
artisans, &c., the authorities show a touching re-
gard for the top-hat and boiled-shirt institution.
Fees of from 2s. Gd. to 10s. 6d. (with 2s. to 6s.
for country witnesses) for women, “according to
station in life,” are a still worse disgrace. Mrs.
Pure Merino, earning nothing at home, loses
nothing by being absent, but Mrs. Cocky does a
man’s and woman’s work combined during her
day, and her absence costs the selection so much
extra.
“S.R.”: “Chip” (B. 25/5/’O5) is*riglit
about the old blunderbuss. It was a terrific
weapon to kill anybody with. The special bullet
used in the Snider by the British troops against
the Zulus was hollow. When it struck an object
it spread out. It made a ghastly wound. I
bought an old Snider and 500 cartridges once.
Spending my holidays on a friend’s selection, I
assisted his son (an expert kangaroo shooter and
skinner) at a week’s ’roo shooting. I was a pretty
good shot and ran his bag pretty close. But the
language he used when he examined some of the
’roes was terrific. Asked me if I couldn’t fetch a
blooming battery while I was about it. Soon
after I joined a rifle club. I did much good shoot-
ing with my Martini-Enfield. With afile I snicked
a cross well into the top of each bullet. This made
it a decent dum-dum ; its hitting power was then
nearly equal to a '44 Winchester. As a handy
sporting rifle the Winchester is the daddy of all
weapons.

“Cronje”: Saw yesterday a string of
caterpillars about a foot long steering in a north-
easterly direction, as if making for a Government
farm. They were peculiarly marked, with two
long spikes sticking out of the
sides of the head, like horns, and a
row of black spots right down the
back to the tail. I thought to try
an experiment, so I killed the
leader. The next in command
took the lead and on they went
like a great Chinese procession.
Then I killed that self-elected
leader. The whole army swung
round till they came to the second
last one, and they gathered round
him or her—all the while emitting
a hissing sound, as if in consul-
tation. After a while they moved
back to places. Then one grisly
fellow took up the white grub’s
burden, but he seemed a canny
general and one capable of taking
in a situation, for he sent out
two scouts on either side to clear
the way. Then the procession
humped its back and pushed on.
Has any Bulletin reader noted this species ?

“D.P.” : carcase-dressing (Bulletin,
5/25/’O5). A carcase that is being dressed for
freezing passes through several hands, and is sawn
from tail-joint to neck (crosscut with two men),
which makes it impossible for one man to complete
the task in the time mentioned. Eight minutes
would be nearer the mark, even in the case of a
small ox. Still, some phenomenal slaughtering
records have been established—in the public-houses
on pay-Saturdays.

“Tuna”: “ Icorner ” (B. 23/2/’O5) is
right, “ T.P.” notwithstanding. Only where he
comes much in contact with tourists and travellers
does the Maori to some extent follow civilised
usages. Elsewhere you have the same old thing—
Maori oven, fleas, dirt, and sitting on the ground
to eat. “ T.P.” is correct about the greenstone
deposit in the South Island. Owing to the
natives’ crude way of treating the large pieces,
much is wasted. They build a huge fire round
the block of stone, and, after 48 hours, deluge it
with water; result, a host of small pieces full of
flaws.
“ F.C.” on Bunny as a livelihood :
Rabbit-trapping' isn’t all beer and skittle3—or even
plain beer—but hundreds of those unemployed who hang
round the cities, chasing the elusive job, might do worse
than take it up for a while. It doesn’t cost a great deal
to start at the game. You must have a mate, better two,
and better still if four go together. There is no fun in
setting traps all day, carrying bunnies a mile or more to
the camp, and coming home cold and tired, and perhaps
Wet, to cook yourself a meal. Mostly, then, you don’t
cook it; you take a snack of something cold and turn in—
and that isn’t good. If there are four of you, you want
four dozen trap 3 (Tonks’) for each of the work-
ing three you may manage five dozen after a
time. Tents, of course, blankets, etc., also an
axe, a tomahawk and three “ setters ” —carpenters’
adzes will do. If you can get three fairish rnokes
do so ; they will hump the traps for you when shifting
ground—perhaps a mile, perhaps five. And you must
have one decent horse, and a light, two-wheeled cart to
take the bunnies, strung in couples on sticks across the
cart, to the railway. To find where to go—thickly-rab-
bited ground—write to anybody you know. If you know
nobody, write (prepaying reply) to a station-master or
any other railway man ; they are obliging, and, besides
knowing if bunnies are thick, they know if anybody else
is trapping in their neighborhood. Get where rabbits are
thickest and as neat as you can to a railway station—
never mind about townships and stores. Yoii take a fort-
night’s or a'month’s supply with you, and when that runs
low you can send a P. 0.0., or one of your rabbit cheques,
to any city wholesale grocer, and he’ll send all you want
to your railway station. But don’t write to any farmer
to find if bunnies pervade the landscape. His ideas and
yours as to the frequency of rabbits are certain to be
totally at variance. If he has ten acres of growing crop
and has seen one rabbit, he is morally certain to tell you
they are as thick as thieves. He will be most pleased to
see you—but he won’t give you grass for your horses.
About horse-feed, you must do the best you can. If there
is any grass about at all—and there won’t be many bunnies
if there isn’t—your one “ carting ” horse will keep himself
in condition most of the year on the roadside. If there
is open land anywhere, you are all right; if there isn’t,
you may have to pay—if you have three prads, most likely
Gd. a week per head. Get near a creek—but don’t get on
it. Get on a slope, halfway down to the creek. Out
gutters round your tents; make “flies” of bags ; and
clean your rabbits on the creek and below your camp (this
will attract fish if the creek boasts any).
Before you start, having- noticed your nearest station,
go to the Fish-market and interview one or two auc-
tioneers to see if they have any rabbit-boxes up that way.
I f they haven’t, get them to send up half-a-dozen. If you
want more, send a note down, they’ll send as many as you
can fill. Also, you’ll get your cheque a day or two after
the bunnies reach the city. You’ve got to trust these
rabbit-auctioneers —they are possibly as great rogues as
the butter-agents, but it can’t be helped. On many
stations export-agents meet the trains regularly and buy
all bunnies offering—paying cash. I don’t suppose they
are any more honest or philanthropic than the “auc-
tioneers.”
When I went trapping, 12 years ago, I knew absolutely
nothing about the game, and my mate but little. He
went to fill iii an unemployed winter, I to regain my
health—l couldn't walk a mile without resting—so we
didn’t consider the thickness of bunnies when we chose
the locality. There was no export trade in bunnies then,
the demand being consequently very restricted, yet we
lived well, had books, papers, and tobacco, kept our-
selves in clothes and boots (the heaviest item), and
cleared about 10s. a week apiece with rabbits averaging
.‘lid. a pair. With experience, something approaching
heavily-rabbited ground and the exporters offering Gd. a
pair, a man should clear, above expenses, from 255. to
355. a week.
A few memos.:—Don’t get second-hand traps. •' Get the
best even if you have to pay 10s. a dozen for them, though
you ought, to get them for 7s. Gd. Take some quinine
with you in case you get wet and chilled. If none of you
can set a trap, .you’ll have to get some farmer’s son to
show you. Best time to start is March, but any time is
good ; you’ll have a job from December to February
keeping" the bunnies from flies, but your own savvy and
the experience of others will suggest what is best to do.
Also in the spring' the young bunnies are a nuisance, but
that can’t be helped—there is no rabbit-trap known that
differentiates between full-grown bunnies and kittens,
and, anyhow, young rabbits, just reaching maturity, are
the best eating, and bring as good a price as big- bucks.
Always go round your traps morning and evening—early
evening, too, if bunnies are thick—and re-set every trap
sprung; and don’t send rabbits away the day they are
killed unless the weather is very cold. Let them hang
over night to stiffen, then they’ll reach the market or the
freezing-chambers stiff. If they don’t get a chance to
stiffen they’ll sweat, and be condemned, and then you’ll
be the freight out of pocket. Don’t waste or destroy any
skins : the hat factories will take all you can bring them.
And if you don’t trap more than a dozen bunnies the first
week don’t lose heart. Also keep shifting your traps.

communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. No liability is under
taken in any ‘ ease re contributions voluntarily sub-
mitted, whether sent by post or handed in; and in

State) accompany.
John C.: (1) What would be the use of passing
a law that no agricultural machinery may be imported
when the same effect can be got by a sufficiently heavy
tariff? (2) No, your economics are wrong. If an article
costs £25. to be made abroad, and a duty of £25 meets it
in Australia, it by no means follows that a similar article
locally-made will cost £5O. It might, indeed, follow that
it would cost less than £25, because the local manufac-
turer, assured of his market and able to gauge exactly its
extent, could produce with great economy. He might,
to give a supposititious case which could be matched with
many actual experiences, produce axes at 3s. if the
local tariff so protected his home market as to give
him a certainty of demand for 50,000 axes a year,
whilst he couldn’t possibly compete, even at a
higher price, with foreign competition, which would
only allow him to sell 20,000 axes in the year....
Struck Oil: It is a case of common slander, for which the
ordinary legal remedy is open... .C.E. J.: Not ill-written,
but required a terser and more dramatic handling....
Moocher : Central incident good, but setting weak....
F.J.L.: Too rough and awkward.... Ken : “Vision” is
artificial and far-fetched.... Sid Weston: Sorry it hasn’t
skill enough Mars: Very near the mark... .Fool: (1)
The par. was complimentary. It came from a man who
knew him intimately,- and as neither the subject of the
par. nor any of his friends have called it in question we
assume it is correct. (2) If you are so fond of cheap
goods why not encourage the cheap worker to come and
make them here ? With cheap workers in the country,
Australia might further economise by finding a man who
would take your billet, whatever it may be, at one-third
what you get....F.L.0.: After much consideration “De-
fences ” just missed the 'bus by a decimal of an inch....
E. : “Last of His Race” is good sentiment but very
bad verse. Also, Socialism doesn’t aim at confiscation as
you seem to think D.S.<^.: Fragment of dead poet’s
skull not worth further discussion. It’s a nasty habit,
anyhow, to treasure-up bits of bodies unless for scientific
purposes A. Sard. :Do you think Burns needs to be
defended against one Murdoch ?... .F.H.N.: Humorous,
but too jerky and inconsequent.. ..F.M.M.: Too many
weak points.. ..Hamer : “Impressionist ” lacks unity and
symmetry....A.M.M’N. : Sorry it isn’t up to the mark—
F. : Much below your usual form.....Currawan : Too
juvenile Maya: Good material, but hardly skill
enough... .M.G.: Conventional in tone and treatment....
Wake : Very sorry. Can only assume that the reckless
artist lost them, for there are, so far as we can trace, no
verses in hand anything like so old as that F.G.O. :
Can’t give you any hope Natura : Sorry not suitable.
Homo: Actively libellous J.W. : Tired of that
“Happy Land” subject P.M. : You “ crave space to
state a few plain facts about Socialism. In the first place,
God is a Socialist.” You know too much for this paper...
C.C.H. : “Face Between” does not convince. Its
emotion is pumped up A. de R. 8.: Will use. Please
in future put name and address on copy Dumps:
Pigeon-shooting - parody declined F.C.: In that perjury
case there was, after all, a possibility that the accused
was telling the truth.... Sugar-cane : Don’t agree
G. : Sorry suggestion not suitable A.C.M. : Mal-
colm is too small a man to justify such a laborious brick.
.. . .L.P. : Correct mostly. Let us raise the tariff and
there will then be more encouragement to the Australian
to raise a family S.A. : Tub Bulletin expects in con-
tributions, if not something new, at least something old
said in a new way... .Riverina: Thanks. The point is
worth pushing home that the existence of Labor legisla-
tion, such as Factories and Arbitration Acts, removes the
Freetrade objection that Protection helps the manufac-
turer, but leaves him free to sweat his workers
Billjim : Exactly--" if.” Repartee has been defined as
saying at the moment what any fool could say an hour
later. San Remo: Don’t remember that par. To your
question—there is no time-limit, if the stuff has no cur-
rent reference F.F.L. : Pretty, but desperately com-
monplace... .Scamp : Cost us 4d., short postage—and
nothing in it at that E. Daley : Too tame and stiff
R. Arbuthnot: Small merit Vyvyene: Rather off our
track Napper Tandy : Not worth print Pan : Touch
not vig’orous enough... .Lethe : Weak and conventional.
Laurie W.: Humorous situation clumsily handled
Maggie K.: Lively, but flimsy J. Carew: Neither is
quite satisfactory Louis: Some ill-directed force in it.
Cion : Such slight material would require brilliant treat-
ment A. J.H.: Not interest enough.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Ande : Sorry to reject a drawing with such a nice
evening-dress girl in it W.N.: One rejected. Others
will do either for direct reproduction or as suggestions.
W.L.B. : Umpire-empire idea only a pun H.W.M. :
“ Pupils are brought into personal contact,” &c., too
mild E. Mac. : Drawings not much good. One of the
gags might serve as a smoking-room story after all respec-
table men had retired F.C.: Soup and phenyle idea
too “high.” A.lt.: Cigarette joke very dull.

“ D’Harum ” writes :
lie “ Exile” on water-finding by means of a bent piece
of wire. The old gentleman who showed him the device
was not its originator ; it has been known to many people
for a very long time, I imagine. However, I have never
seen it done with bent copper wire; I have used, and
have seen other people do likewise, a prong from a live
tree with the sap still fresh in ,it. Otherwise the system
of water-finding I know corresponds with “Exile’s.”
Does anybody know a gobd whisky-finding device ?

“Xerxes” : Re native cats (“Jab.,”B.
11/5/’O5). There are large cats (Dasyures) and a
small kind. The large ones, generally called
“ tiger-catS,” will eat the whole of the fowl they
kill; but the smaller species only makes a punc-
ture near the head and sucks the blood. The latter
kind are of two colors—white-spotted grey (like
the tiger-cat), and white-spotted black. Are these
distinct species ? [Both the larger and the smaller
n iti ve-cats are Dasyures (D. maoulatus and I),
viverrirms), and the color-difference in the smaller
kind is merely one of variety, young ones of both
colors being often found, in the same litter.]

POLITICAL
POINTS
The alternative to Arbitration : “ Gatling
machine guns have been issued to the Chicago
militia for use in the event of serious strike riots.”
After Reid had been barracking against
Socialism for an hour at Newtown (Sydney), the
other night, an agonised voice rang out above the
din, “ George, say something ! ”
A Jap interrupted some derogatory re-
marks on his nation at a Sydney hotel dining
table the other day by blandly stating that in ten
years a Jap would be Chief-Justice of Austral:*.
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers, who says
that he could induce 100 men to settle on the land
with four addresses, would be better employed in
reckoning how many he shut out from agricul-
tural settlement by the improvement lease provi-
sions in his Land Act.
W. E. Johnson, M.H.R. (N.S.W.), who
says that “Socialistic ideas are incompatible with
our religious beliefs and our family life, ” signed,
in 1894, the most solemn Labor League pledge
ever devised, and bound himself to uphold an
absolutely Socialistic platform.
Watson got on to the “point” of the
“ black ” planter when he said at Cairns, “ There
has been no concerted effort made to bring white
laborers to the North.” If the planters had done
as much to secure white labor as they did to get
the nigger, the difficulty would have been over-
come ere this.
The white population of Salmon River
Valley (British Columbia) has decided to resist by
force the introduction of Japanese labor. The
Canadian Government insists, for “Imperial
reasons,” on allowing the free entry of Japanese
into the Dominion, and it seems as though a civil
war would be the harvest of that decision.
Premier Carruthers, the Reform hero,
whose salvation ticket included Reduction of
Ministers, not only leads Moo Brunker (and his
halo) into the Ministry, thereby raising that body
to about the highest number on record, but invests
with Ministerial power a man his constituents
rejected at the polls. All in the name of the
People’s Party.
THINGS AREN’T ALWAYS WHAT THEY
SAY THEY ARE.
Bent, the Blower, seems to have done everything from
acting to cabbage-gardening: but in his Empire speech
he said he had never been to England.
LITTLE BOY FROM BRIGHTON: “ Hang it, he ain’t
the tin god I thought he teas, after all.”
The frenzied statements that the Labor
party is seeking to uproot religion and obliterate
the marriage tie, are so sedulously circulated that
a prominent Anglican (Sydney) clergyman, with
more millinery than sense, has taken it upon him-
self to write to the papers suggesting that the
church should expel all Sunday-school teachers
who are avowed Laborites.
Apropos the Sydney daily papers’ horror
at the interruptions during William M‘Linen’s
recent anti-Socialistic meeting, what about the
same papers’ circular a while ago to the news-
agents, when the Laborites wanted to establish a
new paper ? Under pain of boycott these virtuous
daily papers ordered the agents not to give
Labor even a noisy hearing—they weren’t to let
it have any hearing at all.
That old and trusty friend of the Tory
Sress, “High Authority,” has been stating up
Forth that the Commonwealth Act for Tommy
Tanna’s importation is illegal, insofar that it
infringes on the common law rights of the indi-
vidual, of whatever color, to reside in any part of
the Empire, once he is there. But the Privy
Council tried its venerable front tooth on that
same question long ago, and the Chinaman who
had got into Victoria was thrown out again
on his pigtail, and fell heavily in the exterior
saying “ Whaffor?”
Our friend Jonathan,
from the United States, has
issued a bitter complaint
about “Australian competi-
tion in the Philippines,”
where this country does
about twopenn’orth of trade
per annum—the trade, in
fact, has declined since 1901
—and he wants this com-
merce stopped. It is diffi-
cult to please Jonathan.
He sells us about £5,000,000
worth of goods per annum,
and takes about £2,500,0 0
worth, and demands the dif-
ference in cash. He puts
45 per cent, duty on the
Australian agricultural im-
plement and charges this
duty on the real value ; we
let in most of his agricultu-
ral implements free and
charge the rest 12| per cent,
and allow him to fix the
value that the 12£ per cent,
shall be charged on, and he
fixes it so low that our duty
on Jonathan’s agricultural
implement pans out at about
5 per cent. He has annexed
this implement business
from us, and has taken our
tobacco trade, and is reach-
ing out for other things.
And when this mild, quiet country tries to sell a
load of wool or a chunk of wood to his colony,
Jonathan rages over the landscape like a grizzly
b’ar painted red.
Lascar stokers in the Orient mail service
have been replaced by members of the Federated
Seamen’s Union of Britain—one of the rules of
which is that every member must be a British
subject. The Labor party really seems to be
about the only effective friend that the Boy of the
Bulldog Breed has. He gets a lot of inhar-
monious singing from the Tory person ; but it’s
only the Radical who troubles to get him a job.
“ Until they could change human
nature,” said Joseph Carruthers, scraping his
mild little second-fiddle to G. H. Reid’s lead,
“socialism would be an impossibility, an imprac-
tibility.” Then Joseph went to a socialistic
telephone and ordered supper for 11.45, and
stepped over a socialistic gutter and got into
a socialistic tram, and rode home on a socialistic
train. And the telephone and the gutter and the
tram and the train all winked at Joseph violently.
There is some doubt as to whether the
evidence given before N.S.W. Lands Commission
has the same right to publication as evidence in a
law court, and someone seems to have drawn the
attention of the press to this with a club. For a
while the Sydney Telegraph gleefully printed
the Lands Commission teg-* , '’i2B»y in full. Then
CamlTa 'cold, cold day when it merely said
this: —
The witness then made a series of charges against a
certain politician.
Closer settlement in Victoria under Bent’s
paternal direction is a slow-going reform, anyhow.
Thusfar, nobody has been settled. A first estate
of 23,000 acres, purchased early in March, is ex-
pected to be ready for selection by the end of
August, and meanwhile the applicants for farms
don’t appear deeply impressed by the prospect of
what they are likely to get. On the other hand,
the vendors of the estates are praising and magni-
fying Bent’s name. Their settlement was highly
satisfactory.
Female card-box makers’ union in Sydney
has died while waiting for the dormant Arbitration
tribunal to hear its appeal. Sydney Labor Council
has been informed that employers promptly
reverted to the old sweating conditions, which had
been slightly ameliorated by the formation of the
union. Once more girls earning 3s. to 7s. weekly
are subjected to heavy fines for minor offences.
To be 15 minutes late in arrival now costs the same
old shilling penalty—from one to two days’ pay
gone in one vile swoop.
Sydney Telegraph, in its report of Half-
Premier Reid’s Queensland tour, told how the fat
gentleman was banqueted at Childers, in the
sugar region, and one of the toasts put down on
the list was “Success to the Sugar Industry.”
But the girthy politician got his eye on this pro-
posal to wish good-luck to an Australian industry,
and demanded the removal of the toast from the
list, and, as the Telegraph proudly expressed it,
“the scheme was foiled”—just as if the sugar
industry was the miscreant in the melodrama.
Stated by John Blackman, representative
of the Cooerwull Woollen Mills, before the Tariff
Commission at Sydney (7/6/’O5), that whenever an
article was produced by Australian manufacturers
patterns were forwarded immediately by retailors
to English buyers, whereupon copies came out
made of inferior stuff, which swamped the market.
He declared himself to be a Freetrader, but he
asked for increased duties nevertheless, because
under Freetrade the mills were gradually closing
up. The same old Freetrader !
That down-trodden person Premier Bent
has been ill-used again. At Bendigo, the reporters
thought they heard Bent make a long and violent
attack on the Victorian Labor members, in which
attack he said, among other things, that they
spent half their time in Parliament playing bil-
liards, and neglected their duties. Bent’s after
explanation that he didn’t even allude to the pre-
sent set of Labor members was a pretty loud dis-
claimer. A man may repudiate a sentence, but it
isn’t every man who has the cheek to repudiate
half a column or so.
Victorian Premier Bent’s latest notion
is to sell the 3G3 acres comprising the big Kew
lunatic asylum grounds, and with the proceeds
build an up-to-date asylum elsewhere. But he
seems to have forgotten that this land is virtually
sold already. The late unlamented Gillies long
ago reckoned he could get a million for it, so he
borrowed the million on the strength of his
expectations, and promptly splashed the coin
around. Now anything that can be got from the
sale or lease of the land should go to wipe up
Duncan’s splash.
A REVEREND ANAUCIIIST.
Rev. M‘Cann (Melbourne), at a Temperance Thanksgiving for closed
hotels, said if he were the Premier he would close all superfluous hotels at
once without compensation.
THE CONFIDCATIOR (savagely): “If I had my way I'd take your
blooming loaf” (snarl), “and you and your brats wouldn ’t
get a bite, see!” (Another snarl.)
SMALL VOICE (from rear): “Hold tight, dtddy!”
Thus the Age, Melbourne
Any Ministerial interposition would smack of Socialism,
and Socialism of every kind we know, is equivalent to
political damnation. This is the kind of clap-trap which
is preached from decade to decade in order ... to keep
the noses of the producers hard on the grindstone.
Old man Syme’s paper just now promises to be a
tower of strength to the cause of progress. Instead
of retrograding it grows more Radical as David
grows older.
“Two-Seas”: The number of questions
that are not put by the Lands Commission is
a noble tribute to the power of bluff and bluster
exhibited by some of the unwilling witnesses.
One question that should be put to all land agents
is : “ How many eases have you had during the
past three years in which your fee has been £lOO
or more, and particulars of same?” That “bill of
costs” in the Sims case shows how difficult it is
to total a genuine charge of £lOO, even when
assisted by such an item as “ Carrutbers £25.”
The usual deputation —heaven only knows
how often that deputation has turned up—lately
applied to the N.S.W. Government for work, and
quite a number have been put on at a railway de-
viation job. A railway deviation works out like
this
(1) A railway is built out of loans.
(2) It is decided that on one section of it a bad route
was selected, so a certain number of miles of line on a
better route are built out of loans.
(3) When the new line is finished the old one is torn up
loans.
(4) i\o aßefitpt is made to pay off any of these loans.
In Victoria, under the regime of Bent,
pointsmen occasionally have to work 18 hosrc '">h
of the 24. At a cabin where three men are em-
ployed, it sometimes happens that one falls sick ;
then the department stops the sick man’s pay and
generally makes the other two do his work with-
out extra remuneration. The same sort of economy
pervades the service, and occasionally the man
who has been on duty for 12 or 18 hours loses his
grip of things. There was a big smash the other
day, and when the bill comes in it will require a
good deal more economy of the Bent kind to make
up for it.
Thomas Bent, referring to the Butter Com-
mission’s report, says he has a Secret Commis-
sions Bill on the stocks which goes even further
than Lord Russell’s English Act, and that “it
was arranged at the Hobart Conference that I
should draft such a Bill and send copies to the
other Premiers with a view to joint action by the
Parliaments of the six States.” Bent’s idea of
progress is that his Bill should be discussed at
great length by 600 legislators in 12 different
Houses. Yet didn’t we federate so as to have one
Parliament to deal with matters that concern the
whole of the Commonwealth ?
The Westralian State Government, at the
prompting of the ’Groper fruit-growers, is making
mincemeat of one clause of the Constitution. On
the pretence of only blocking diseased fruit, it
makes it almost impossible to get in fruit grown
in other States ; and when it is admitted, the price
has to be put up enormously to make good the
loss through scores of cases having been destroyed,
with the result that the local Groper gets a huge
inter-State Protection never contemplated by the
Constitution. Chaffey Baker, President of the
Senate, who is interested in the S. Australian fruit
business, told Premier Daglish the other day that,
just to see what would happen, one case of apples
and one of pears was examined by two experts
before being shipped, every fruit was overhauled,
and nothing far., tly suspicious admitted. Yet
those two cases were condemned. And the humor
of the situation is that the Westralian fruit-area is
simply crawling with disease.
The results of the South Australian elec-
tions made the Melbourne Argus very angry;
in fact, that usually mild-tempered old lady
almost lost control of herself on the occasion,
and hit out with her dishcloth with a fury that
was rather surprising. The fact that the S.A.
Labor party got several M’s.P. from the neigh-
boring States and the Commonwealth Parliament
to help it was what chiefly raised the dander of
the Argus, and it got off remarks like these :
A contest anywhere to which he (the Labor member) is
invited is as welcome as pay-day. .
He (the unfortunate Labor member again) is almost
bursting with unexpended loquacity.
The States and Commonwealth pay the men (still tne
Labor members) liberal salaries and transport them to any
place where they may happen to be required, free of cost.
One effect of the practice of turning a horde of du e -
gaged politicians (this refers, of course, to Labor mem De l
into the field at every election will be to embitter the
feeling between the State and Federal Parliaments, which
is not too cordial at present.
They (Labor members, once more) employ tbemseßes
as peripatetic spouters and touters m party interest .
And all this waving of the enraged cotton umbre a
because the Argus’s friend, John Darling, was
seventh on the list in his constituency.
This moan appeared in S.M. Herald’s
leading article of June 7 :
William M‘Millan, at the Protestant Hall a week or so
ago, said that money was still leaving the country.
It is, William M‘Linen, it is. On a rough esti-
mate £2,800,000 a year is leaving N.S.W. alone to
pay interest on foreign public debt, and a million
or two a year to pay interest on foreign private
debt, and somewhere about £12,000,000 a year to
pay for foreign imported goods, most of which
could be locally produced. Mr. Importer M‘Linen
never spoke more truly than when he remarked
that money was still leaving the country.
The Tasmanian Collector of Customs states
that the increase in that State’s industries
which was reported in 1903 has stopped, and that
1904 was a year of slump. One clothing factory,
employing 20 hands, has closed; likewise three
boot factories (100 hands), three soap and candle
factories (35 hands), and two confectionery fac-
tories ; while there is depression in almost every
other industry, save the heavily-protected beer
factories. When this dismal report came out
Sydney Telegraph braced itself for a great effort,
and started its leading article thus :
A stronger argument for fiscal peace than any that has
been presented to the Tariff Commission for reviving the
tariff fight is contained in the reports from the Tasma-
nian and Westraiian Collectors of Customs on the effects
of the Federal tariff in their States.
The Japanese are said to have “ mentioned
their terms or some of them. They want the
Chinese town of Port Arthur, and the Chinese
territory of Liao-tung. They want Russia to
evacuate Manchuria, and as Japan demands pos-
session for itself of the Manchurian railway right
up to Harbin, it probably proposes to hold the
territory also—the railway without the territory it
runs through would be of little use. Also it
demands Korea, so apparently China is to get
back nothing of what it lost to Russia, and is also,
by way of a fresh robbery, to lose its shadowy
rights as suzerain of the Land of the Morning
Calm. After these things are fixed up, the Jap
wants Saghalien and an indemnity. If Russia
should acceed to these terms it will want money
badly, and presumably it will begin, by way of
raising the wind, to oollect the indemnity that
Turkey has owed it for the last 27 years. Then
there will be more trouble.
Vic. Premier Bent has made a stupid
attempt to excuse his action in insisting that
a printer in the Government office who happened
to be a member of the Political Labor Council
should either leave the Council or leave his billet.
“It would be a nice thing,” says the political
hobbledehoy from Brighton, “to have a member
of the Political Labor Council among the printers,
talking politics instead of doing his work.” But
when Bent howled that the man must either give
up his printing job or his connection with the
Political Labor Council, he didn’t accuse him of
proselytising in business hours. Bent came down,
on him simply and solely because he was a con-
spicuous Labor man. Kow that he has aban-
doned the P.L.C. he is allowed to remain in tLo
service, though his views haven’t changed, and he
is as likely as he was before to talk politics in
working hours. In fact, he is more likely to do it
now than he was before. If anything can confirm
him in his views, it is likely to be his recent
experience of the petty silly tyranny of a yelling
lout of the Bent class.
THE SOCIALISTIC CAT.
A cat can look at a king;
But, O, a cat of that size
Were quite a different thing
In the sight of Oeorgie's eyes.
State Premier Carruthers at Ryde
(N.S.W.), June?: —
He never said the Labor Party was a socialistic party.
He had read and studied Socialism but he could not give
the Labor Party credit for practising or even preaching it.
The only place where it would be practicable or possible
would be Heaven.
On this basis why not call the Anti-socialist
party “Anti-Christ” for short? Then comes
this item (Sydney Telegraph, June 10): —
In the course of an address on Socialism to a meeting of
the Women’s Liberal League at North Sydney the other
evening, Mrs. Osborne said that there were many different
kinds of Socialism, but they were all alike, inasmuch as
the object was to repress individuality and to increase the
power of the State. The lecturer quoted Milton’s line :
“ To disenthrone the King of Heaven, we war, if war we
must,” in support of the theory that Satan was the first
Socialist.
This is a fearsome discrepancy and almost amounts
to a statement that Satan hangs out in Heaven as
a regular thing.
When colds and influenza rage,
They add to life a dismal page,
They make us all look twice our age—
And scatter death around.
‘Tis then we find a friend so sure,
In William Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.
Which, always certain, always pure,
Will save us many a pound.*

Ears .Looked as if they Would Drop
Off—Body Entirely Covered with
Sores— Three Doctors Could Not
Cure—Child Grew Worse.
CURED BY CUTICURA
IN TWO WEEKS
Mrs. George J. Steese, of 701 Coburn St.,
Akron, Ohio, tells in the following letter
of another of those remarkable cures of
torturing, disfiguring skin htimours daily
made by Cuticura Remedies, after phy-
sicians, and all else had failed: “I feel
it my duty to parents of other poor suf-
fering babies to tell you what Cuticura
has done for my little daughter. She
broke out all over her body with a hu-
mour, and we used everything recom-
mended, but without results. I called in
three doctors, they all claimed they
could help her, but she continued to
grow worse. Her body was a mass of sores,
her little face was being eaten away, and
her ear 9 looked as if they would drop off.
Neighbours advised me to get Cuticura
Soap and Ointment, and before I had
used half of the cake of Cuticura Soap
and the box of Cuticura Ointment, the
sores had all healed, and my little one’s
face and body was as clear as a new-born
babe’s. I would not be without it again
if it cost a fortune instead of the small
sum it cost us to cure our baby, after
spending much money on doctors and
medicines without any benefit whatever.”
SLEEP FOR BABIES
Rest for Tired, Fretted Mothers

Instant relief and refreshing sleep for
skin-tortured babies, and rest for tired,
fretted mothers, in warm baths with Cuti-
cura Soap and gentle anointings with

cient to cure the most distressing cases.

The Assassin of Public Opinion.
The Tory press of Australia seems to be un-
animously of opinion that an anti-Labor policy is
the best advertisement-canvasser. And the
campaign against arbitration is consequent on this
belief. Everyone knows how virulently that
has been carried on. There is no trick that has not
been practised in the way of suppression, distor-
tion, mis-statement, and even of deliberate
prevarication, concerning the proceedings of
the Arbitration Courts in N.S. Wales. Westralia,
and even of Maoriland. To such an extent has a
corrupt and contemptible anti-arbitration cam-
paign been carried on that Justice Cohen, on at
least three occasions, made lengthy and detailed
protests from the bench of the N.S.W. Arbitra-
tion Court against the unscrupulous manner in
which the local press had striven to prejudice
public opinion with regard to the decisions and
methods of the court over which he presided. As
for Maoriland, the Australian daily papers
have insisted that the arbitration courts of
that State were always congested with busi-
ness, that their decisions gave satisfaction to
no one—neither to employers, employees, nor to
the general public. But within a week or so of
the date on which these words were used by an
Australian daily, its M.L. correspondent was
permitted to inform its readers that Justice
Chapman had suspended the latest session of the
Arbitration Court at Auckland because there were
neither breaches of awards nor industrial disputes
submitted for its consideration and settlement.
Therefore, in a city which the Auckland Evening
Post once styled ‘ ‘ the storm centre of our industrial
world,” there is, again to quote that paper, “an
entire absence of friction and heart-burning.” The
M.L. paper, usually suspected of Tory proclivities,
is also honest enough to give the arbitration laws
credit for the change. But the journals of
most Australian capitals devote daily much time
to the poisoning of the wells of truth, until
it seems about time that some steps were taken to
suppress this constant belying of the country’s
laws and public institutions. It has been said
that the assassination of public opinion is a more
grievous crime than the assassination of a human
being. Why then should the hired stabber, whose
dagger is a fountain-pen, be longer permitted
impunity ? Why should it be considered wrong
to slander an individual while it is allowable to
defame a law, its administration, and the results
arising therefrom ? Is there to be protection from
the defamer for everyone, no matter how humble,
but none for the public conscience, the most
delicate, the most susceptible of all ? It is time
that something were done to make press-lying on
public subjects a less profitable occupation by pro-
vision for the punishment of any journal whicn is
found guilty of habitually endeavoring to mislead
and prejudice public opinion—the very soul of
the nation.
Bull Cohen and his French and Belgian brethren,
who own most of the Westralian mines, haven t
yet, in their thirst for dividends, introduced the
Chow, but, according to evidence given to the
Federal Old Age Pensions Commission when it was
in the West, they are doing the next worst thing—
they are ruthlessly sacking older miners who are
even a trifle past their bullockmg prime. One
witness swore that men who were showing streaks
of grey were getting into the habit of using dyes ;
and there is plenty of evidence that the mines make
men grey very rapidly. It looks as though Cohen,
Cohenstein, Coiienloup and Co. aren’t content
with simply rifling Australia of its gold, and leav-
ing the refuse in the tailing-dumps to pay the
deficit with ; but they also use up Australia’s
most virile human material, and when it shows
signs of wear they throw that also out on the
refuse dump. This is what comes of “bringing
capital into the country which means handing
the country over for exploitation to a foreigner,
who looks at it, not as the home of a nation, but
simply as a source of dividends.

During a debate in the House of Lords on Eng-
land’s system of Chinese slavery in S’Africa—
The Archbishop ot Canterbury admitted that the
Chinese were being accorded fair treatment, but hoped
that the moral aspect would be adequately considered.
Possibly the Archbishop is not to be blamed too
severely. He is human, and he is paid to be a
smug pillar of hypocrisy, not a priest and a teacher.
But the reek of his cant is none the less disgust-
ing. What consideration for morals can there be
in a system which herds scores of thousands of
men, away from their wives and families, in com-
pounds for several years at a stretch ? The Chinese
slave compounds at Johannesburg must be moral
hells, and the Archbishop must know that they
are and can be nothing else than hells.
Sachse, Vic. Minister of Education, wants
to establish museums in country centres, using
State school children as collectors. > Also, “ the
early colonists are fast disappearing,’ says Sachse,
and it is, in his view, desirable “to obtain well-
written interviews with them, and have them
framed and placed in State schools. Sachse
shows some discernment in coupling this idea
with that of a museum of curiosities. He must
have conceived the scheme while looking on Ben
Goddard, of Kyabram.
Rep. Bonython, of the Adelaide Adver-
tiser, is between two devils. One of them wants
his paper, and the other wants his seat. Ihe
’Tiser’s wobblesomeness led to the Labontes pro-
moting a rival daily, and the project is still moving
on ; while the ’Tiser’s belated, but in the end
vigorous, fight for franchise reform so riled the b.
Australian Tory party that now John Darling has
declared that he will run for Bonython s seat next
Federal election. But he had better not. He
ought to remember what happened to his political
chum, Sudden Solomon, who is now glad to grope
after a small State seat again in the back parts ot
S. Australia.
For a proof that the Sydney Telegraph
is merely a subsidised organ of the importing
party, compare the way it treats the exporter of
raw material and the exporter of manufactured
machinery. The Telegraph has always professed
an amazing desire to see this country build up
a vast exporting business To encourage the
people to tear raw material out of the earth and
off the face thereof, it has advocated unremunera-
tive railway rates, the right of the employer to
sweat his employees, and the absolute necessity
for the cheapest of cheap labor. All manner of
State assistance should be given to the „ poor
farmer,” the “backbone of the country. Ihe
State should build cool stores for his bullsgrease
and subsidise foreign shipping lines that they
might carry his wool cheap. But when the
Harvester-making industry comes abng-an
industry which pays wages on which men can
rear families and be creditable oitizens-andasks
not for assistance like the “poor farmer, but for
defence against illegal and unfair competition,
what a change on the face of Hie Ogre in King-
street Then the man who wants to build up an
export trade is an “ insatiable Protectionist, and
something between a public enemy and a pm-
jam.

Medical men evidently believe in Cleanliness
being the Handmaiden of Health (not to mention godli-
ness) judging from their enthusiastic attendance at Daly’s
Turkish Baths, Eoyal Arcade, Melbourne. And they like
their little joke as well as their little wash. Quoth one of
their prominent humorists the other day, midst a chorus
of approval, “ We send as many of our patients to you as
we possibly can, Daly, to have their diseases dissolved for
the time being ; but we don’t want to permanently injure
our practices in the interests of our fellow man.*
Bad Breath..
The Tongue is the Index.
Your breath is foul, and you do not perceive It
yourself. Like the person who is always among
the oils and varnishes, and gets used to what is to
many people a most obnoxious smell. It is most
disagreeable to those with whom you come in con-
tact. Look at your tongue in the looking-glass
every night and morning, and if it is at all dis-
colored take a couple of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. They will remove the objectionable matter
from the stomach, regulate the system, and
sweeten the breath. One or two of these pills
taken two or three times a week will ensure a well-
regulated system, fortified against all diseases.
They cleanse the stomach, put life in the liver,
a move to the bowels and thereby are a positive
and permanent cure for constipation, biliousness,
sick headache, piles, pimples, boils, skin diseases,
and all disorders arising from imperfect digestion
and impure blood. Packed in amber bottles, and
sold throughout Australasia.*

physician treated him. He grew steadily worse.

It is good news to Commonwealth smokers that
“ Marsuma ” cigars have come here. Marsumas are made
of East Indian leaf, which is said by many experts to be
far superior to Havanna, and have the advantage of
being far more economical to smoke. The Havanna
cigar, says one authority, is living on a past reputation,
the Marsuma is making a present fame. Such judges as
Pinero, Conan Doyle, Henry Irving, and our own Edmund
Barton speak highly of the Marsuma.*

SPORTING NOTIONS
The Maoriland team of British Association
footballers will officially arrive in Sydney to-day,
and get down to serious business on Saturday, the
17th, when they will meet a Metropolitan team, at Epping.
Altogether, 11 matches will be played, three of which will
be inter-State—those on June 24, July 1, and July 22. As
the British Association people in Sydney play their style
of game better than any other footballers of that city,
these, matches ought to be worth seeing. It is possible
that in this campaign the Cornstalks will be successful,
and Maoriland may go back home with its dejected tail
dragging in the water.
• • • •
Of the Maoriland “ Soccer” football team which
landed in N.S.W. this week only five members played
against N.S.W. in the tests last season, when the Corn-
stalks were in Maoriland. All the rest are young players
who have come to the top since. The visitors will find
the difference between their own and the Sydney grounds
very much against them at first, but by the end of the
tour they should be reasonably accustomed to the harder
surface. Also, as they get hardened, the N.S.W. surfaces
will be getting softer.
• • * •
In Sydney, Pyrmont, Glebe and Rozelle head
the “ Soccer” competition with 10 points each, and
Ultimo is pressing close behind with nine points. The
once-powerful Granville club is at the bottom of the list,
with six matches played and lost; a fearful example of
how the mighty get blown away when the door is left
open. The team that is to arrive from Maoriland on the
15th was, just before departing, beaten by a Wellington
team by five to three. Which is generally the thing that
happens to the team that is going abroad. It seems to
chance that way, so that if the departing team loses on
its tour—“ Well, it was only a second-rate team ” ; and if
it wins—“ Whoop ! see what we can do even when we
have left our best players behind.”
# * * *
Under Australian rules the Y.M.O.A. won its
sixth consecutive match, North Sydney being the
victim this time. It vvas not quite the defeat inflicted
on Paddington a short while ago ; some remnants of the
vanquished were to be found among the ruins this time,
the score being 61 to 51 points. First quarter saw the
Good Young Men go ahead, but the'Northmen pulled up
so well during the second that the third quarter started
even. It didn’t long continue so, as the Good Young
Men got in some beautiful kicking and marking, and
went ahead with a rush. The North Sydneys took charge
in the last quarter, and scored at a great pace, but time
ran out before they could overtake the Good Young
Men, and the Y.M.O.A. had won its hardest match.
Paddington underwent a severe banging at the boots of
Sydney, which beat Neild’s suburb by 50 to 20. The
downfall of the day was West Sydney’s obliteration by
Newtown. Newtown ended with 121 points to West
Sydney’s 17, and when the ruin is so bad as that detail is
almost unnecessary.
* * * *
That Hebrew gentleman who wrote in Holy-
Writ that any race was liable to boil over, nearly had his
remarks endorsed in the Balmain-Glebe Rugby match at
Sydney University Oval on Saturday. Glebe was the
team that had, so far, not lost a game Balmain
had won a game, although drawing a bye gave
it credit for two wins on paper. Naturally it was
expected that Glebe would make dead meat of the water-
siders. And then the Scripture came nigh to being ful-
filled, for Balmain forwards played a clever game, and
smothered and bustled the enemy’s back division. At the
very first, George Pile’s suburb rushed Glebe down on to
its line, and a try was scored, and a great hush of surprise
fell on the people and deprived the barracker of the
power of yelling. Eventually Glebe pulled itself together,
and won by 6 to 3 ; but it was a tough fight, with the
issue always in the balance.
• * « *
The powerful-legged Rugbyites who roam
through the sand dunes of South Sydney met the wild
hillmen from North Shore on Saturday, and although the
hillmen secured the first score, the others had all the best
of it. Gradually they wore the North Shore men down,
and then ran over them, to the tune of 21 to 8. The
losing team seemed to have gone stale and to be played
out; and someone blundered by failing to replace worn-
out forwards with young players. Also, the South men
were aided by a player with the fearsome name of Remen-
schneider, which was itself almost equal to ten points.
University went down to Newtown by 14 to 3. It is now
becoming evident that the formation of the Sydney Dis-
trict Club has taken the sap out of the once mighty
Eastern Suburbs team. The unfortunate Easterns have
lost the whole six matches they have played, and are the
disgusted possessors of the only duck egg on the list.
* * * *
Melbourne Football Club —of the Yic. League-
moves to put large numbered tickets on the backs of the
players, so that the casual visitor may know who is who,
and little Lizzie may the more easily identify her boy. So
far the other clubs don’t see it and the League refuses
permission. If the League is wise it will continue in that
frame of mind. If the player with the extra-hard
head and heavy boot knows he is being watched indi-
vidually by persons who can identify him, he may
play to the gallery by putting on an extra spurt now and
then ; but in sport, as in politics, the individual but selfish
player who makes brilliant dashes is not the one who wins
games for his side. Co-operation beats individual play
every time. In an ideal game no one should be identifi-
able, save only the captains—and, of course, the referee.
He can be identified by the road-metal thrown at him.

“ Critic ” : Football must be a very uninterest-
ing game in the Wimmera district of Victoria. Comment-
ing on the recent closely-contested match between
Horsham and Stawell, the Horsham Times says: “The
Horsham brass band was on the ground, and greatly
helped to break the monotony of the afternoon by playing
selections.” And this band recently entered for a c mpe-
tition and got sixth place. (There were six competitors.)

Nothing unusual is transpiring in Victorian
football as far as the play itself is concerned, Fitzroy being
still undefeated and Collingwood having lost but one
game—to ’Roy aforesaid ; but the barrackers are getting
more willing every week. Fines of 40s. apiece, inflicted
by the Carlton beaks on a couple of “ supporters ” who
expressed their disapproval of an umpire too forcibly,
failed to urge these ill-conducted persons to more decorous
behavior; for last Saturday, at half-time, in the Associ-
ation match —Richmond v. Ports —a howling mob of semi-
lunatics swarmed across the low picket fence and climbed
all over umpire O’Loghlen before police or players could
grasp their intention. He was rescued, and refereed to the
finish, but had to be escorted on and off the ground. The
game was exceptionally close, Ports winning by 29 points to
27, and there was every excuse for excitement, but none
whatever for 200 alleged men attacking one soli-
tary umpire. For some years there has been bad blood
between these teams, and last time writer saw them play
a dozen mounted and a score of foot police were there to
restrain the barrackers. Association umpires get £1 Is.
per game—and they earn it.

“ B.” : Private and public accounts received
from England describe the abominably cold weather in
which the Australian team was called upon to play its
first matches. It is perhaps to this that many dropped
catches may be ascribed. The Sydney press writers who
dispense the daily “ comments on the situation,” are very
severe on the failings of the fieldsmen, but probably they
don’t know what it is like when a frozen man tries to
catch a frozen ball in Greenland. But the bowling
averages of the Australians have a despairful look. At
the time rain stopped play in the Marylebone match on
the first day, Laver had taken 5S wickets—only one less
than Cotter, Howell, .Noble, and Hopkins combined, and
Laver only went to England to manage the tour, while
the other four went to bowl the English batsmen out, and
send J. Bull’s wicket into the centre of next week.

Hirst, the Yorkshireman, seems to have got a
leg which may keep him out of all the test matches. The
wonder is that he has been able to do so much work these
last few years. His long run to the wicket, when bowl-
ing, includes a queer hop and a step, and his delivery of
the ball is of the laborious, back-spraining order. Nothing
of the free, easy, wiry cricketer about Hirst.
« * * *
Ringrose, the Yorkshire bowler, looks a very
valuable discovery for the Englishmen. Last season he
played only nine times for the county, and his bowling
was not of much account. Evidently he had no reputa-
tion when Yorkshire met the Australians in May, for
whilst the visitors were knocking up a long score,
Ringrose got very little show. His average was two wickets
for 36 first innings, and in Yorkshire’s second innings
he bowled but three balls. Since then he has probably
been coming on, for jn the return match he started the
Yorkshire attack, and justified his promotion by giving
the Australians “ fits.” Maybe he is merely a new
puzzle in bowlers rather than a fixed star, in which case
he will cease to be dangerous when he loses his freshness ;
but thusfar he has done great things. Nine wickets for
76 on a batsman’s wicket is about the hottest perform-
ance an Australian Eleven has ever experienced in
England.

“B.B.” : R. A. Duff, up to and including the

Marmont and his full-brother Merrion are two

or reckon him to be a little on the down grade ? And will
Merrion rank as the poor hurdle-race performer of yore,
or the comparatively respectable flat-racer who won a

Entries for Melbourne and Caulfield Cups,
closed last week, reveal a shortage on previous years’

entry for seven years. What this decline is due to Turf-

The trotting gent is in a class by himself. When
he makes up his mind to commit a robbery—that is to
say, when the whole of him agrees that it is Borndead’s
turn to win to-day—only accident or lunacy will frus-
trate him. It was partly accident and partly lunacy
that occurred the other day. There were ten starters
in a handicap trot. Betting opened with the usual
false favorite. Punters have an idea that it is good
business to wait for the favorite at the “ death-knock,”
and then go in. So it came that the usual rush just pre-
vious to the start sent out one an odds-on chance. Now,
the cunning crowd was not on this favorite, but the one
solitary trier in the race (Borndead’s horse), being ridden
in a wretched fashion, came round the turn for home
running third, with the favorite (going as slowly as it
dared) second, and Nothing-in-particular first. The case
was a desperate one, and two mannikins came to a simul-
taneous decision. The one on the favorite (second) de-
cided to turn his horse across the course towards the fence,
and thus lose as much ground as possible. The more
reckless one on Nothing-in-particular (first) decided to
slew his horse across the course, collide with the favorite,
and put them both out of the running, so that No. 3
(Borndead’s horse) must win. They both slewed simul-
taneously. The result was that the second horse wasn’t
there for the first to collide with, but the third one (Born-
dead’s horse) was. They went down (the rider of No. 3
never expected such treatment, and the thing was too
realistic), and the favorite simply had to win. And the
language destroyed the grass for three miles round.

which very rarely blend well. If the reversed-name fiend
should strike any of War God’s stock, we’ll probably have

Women punters are becoming so numerous on
the S. Australian courses that the clubs are seriously con-
sidering the establishment of separate totalisators for the
exclusive use of the Sex which wears the beautiful hat
and can never make up its mind. But women don’t want
separate totes—they want to be on the machine where the
most money is invested, and totalisators patronised by
women alone would pay microscopic dividends. In
N.S.VV. and Victoria the mild bookmaker snorts wildly
when the woman punter approaches him. She has a
vague idea that he is a remnant, and tries to get him at a
reduction, and she bargains till Isaac feels as if he wanted
to go away behind the grand stand and be a dangerous
lunatic.

Late English files disclose that the devil’s num-

2000 Guineas. Vedas was No. 13 in the book ; rider drew
13th position ; and the colt’s starting price, 11 to 2,
totalled 13. Also, it was Vedas’ 13th race, and his was
the 13th preliminary canter past the stand. Further,

Robinson, rode a 2000 Guineas winner, Bona Vista, the

The liveliest sport that Melbourne has seen
since the roaring days of old was provided, by the Weber-
Woods wrestle, at the Athenaeum Hall, last week. The
rival merits of the men had been discussed in the local
law court, when Woods sued Hackenschmidt for wages,
or something, and this match was to decide whether the
Russian had over-rated his young pupil Weber. The
question was soon decided. Weber slung Woods to the
floor and flattened him out in half-a-minute. When they
presently closed for the second bout (the match was for
best two out of three), Woods attempted a strangling
hold. Weber raised his hand in protest, and the referee
ordered a break-away. Immediately Weber repeated his
previous cross-buttock, and slung Woods fairly and
squarely upon his two shoulders, but the fall was some-
what off the mat, and Woods was ordered to place himself
in the centre of the stage, with Weber in charge of him.
The Englishman contrived to wriggle, and put his stum-
mick where his back had been, but, after some six
minutes of experimental work, Weber got a half-Nelson
hold, and levered the prostrate one over upon his two
shoulders. Within seven minutes, all told, the Australian
had taken three falls out of the “ champion of the British
navy,” though only two of them counted. Then Buttan
Singh sent up a challenge to wrestle Weber for £25, where-
upon the youngster threw off the coat he had slipped over
him, and said, “ I’ll wrestle him now— put him up.”
Buttan wasn’t taking any sporting offers of that sort.
The crowd chaffed the astonished nigger, he hung his
black head, and slunk out of the hall with his spokes-
man in tow.

The lost Victorian mace has a less scandalous
parallel in the English Football Cup, a cheap but much-
prized trophy, open to the whole kingdom. Ten years
ago it disappeared from a shop window in Birmingham,
where it was being exhibited by the local club that had
won it. It was never heard of again.
• • • *
Old Jack Graham’s attempt to lay down
the laws for the Weber-Woods wrestling match was appar-
ently actuated by mixed motives. Graham was
bound to preach the obsolete doctrine of strangle in
order to justify the decision he gave at Wirth’s circus last
year, when, as referee, he permitted Buttan Singh to
squeeze the neck of young Weber until blood came from
his ears and he dropped insensible from the black man’s
grip. It was after hearing the account of the Buttan-
Weber contest on the morning of his arrival in Melbourne
that Hackenschmidt got the notion of converting the raw
young Australian into a better sort of champion than
black Buttan. The first notable result of Hack’s sports-
manlike idea was Weber’s ridiculously easy defeat of
Woods t’other night. It only remains for the youngster
to take his revenge out of the heathen who was allowed
to choke him at Wirth’s circus. As regards Jack
Graham’s apologies for strangling holds, the friends of
the veteran point out that he learned the game in the
old school, and is now speaking by the book —the old
school-book. He would let both men do “ all they know.”
Well, if Weber and Buttan Singh wrestled all they knew
next week, the Hindu population of Melbourne would
probably be reduced by one.

The Geelong (Vic.) police lately tried to put an
end to the alleged “ sport ” of coursing rabbits with fox-
terriers in an enclosed paddock. They proceeded under
sec. 28 of the Vermin Destruction Act, which forbids the
wilful setting loose of bunny. The plea that defeated the
prosecution—that the rabbits were not set loose, as they
had absolutely no chance of escape—was in reality the
strongest condemnation of the practice from a sporting
point of view. The P.M. opined the Vermin Destruction
Act was not intended to meet such a case, and he was
probably right; but if the Cruelty to Animals Act doesn’t
cover the difficulty, it certainly should be made to. If the
object is to kill bunny, a gun or a waddy is speedier and
less painful. The assurance that he has no chance of
escape reduces the alleged “ sport ” to a level with the
practice of drowning, kittens in a tub.

The cabled result of the Roberts-Stevenson
billiard match throws no light on the question whether
the younger artist was “ waiting for a wager ” during the
first half of the game, when Roberts gained more than
half the 2000 points he had conceded. Stevenson scored
faster than the old champion in the second stage, and
finally won by,1520 points— i.e., he made 16,000 whilst
Roberts was making 16,480. This leaves the grey-haired
man still at the top of the tree “ for figures,” but he has
been there, or thereabouts, for 35 years, and the chances
are that Stevenson will beat him on level terms when they
meet in a straight-out championship match. The strain
upon their nerves will be greater than it, was in the recent
game, and the young nerve ought to outstay the old.
Roberts, considering his age, is a more amazing player to-
day than ever he was, but he isn’t miraculous.

Maoriland has fixed a cold, thoughtful eye on
the bookmaker who lays totalisator odds. At Auckland
a penciller and his client were hauled up on six
charges, and the Rhadamanthus fined the bookmaker £lO

the extent of £2O. Then he announced that in future
he would deal out imprisonment in addition to a
fine. So there is horror in Israel, and the hair of Jacob is

Effete Britain came out on top when ancient
cyclist Sid Jenkins beat American Kramer in a semi-final
at Paris recently. The Briton “ jumped ” fully 200yds.
from home, and when Kramer settled down to catch him
the old man kept going at such a pace that the
Yankee found the contract too large. All the same,
it was a ease of tactics and not speed ; when Jenkins shot
over the line Kramer was only a wheel be hind him.
Saturday last saw the “road-racing season”
officially opened in N.S. W. by the Marrickville club’s ten
mile spin. Wheelers turned up in force, no less than 500
being present, as well as motor-bikers and people in cars.
Out of 106 entries there were 93 starters, and, although
the road was in excellent condition, falls were frequent.
Baker, of the Northern Suburbs, won the event, his
actual riding time for the ten miles being 30min. 12sec.,
while fastest time was put up by P. R. Ray, of Curzon
Park club, who hunted himself over the distance in
2Snnn. 58sec.

That the chairman and secretary of the Federal
Cycling Council should occupy exactly the same position
on the Council of the Victorian League of Wheelmen is
not only an anomaly, but is utterly wrong. The C uncil
should be in all things absolutely independent of any of
the Leagues, and a man can no more conscientiously rep-
resent two cycling bodies than he can love each of
three wives best. Whenever the Victorian League comes
into conflict with the Federal Council, the secretary or
chairman must throw over the one or the other. The
E resent arrangement means simply that the Victorian
eague has undue weight in the Council.

The Fennessy-Farley battle at Queen’s Hall,
Melbourne, last week, appears to have been very savage.
At the gong they sprang at one another, and Farley
was sent to the boards five times. The second round
saw the tables turned somewhat, Farley managing
to batter Fennessy to the floor. Then all regard
for the M.Q. rules was abandoned, and the bruisers
held each other and bashed furiously-, wrestled, fell over
the ropes, punched wildly at each other as they fell,
punched wildly on the floor, and punched wildly while
getting up. The audience lost its head and yelled till its
jaw went lame, and the noise prevented the referee’s
voice being heard, so he went into the ring and per-
sonally tore the men apart as if they were
wet blotting paper. Meanwhile the audience fought
among itself, and gave the bruisers a well-
earned spell. The third round saw Fennessy riot-
ously aggressive, and Farley went down persistently.
Another free fight in the hall and a wild and deafening
dispute between the seconds and the referee caused them
to go to their corners till something like order was re-
stored. When the noise died down Farley announced he
was “ satisfied.” Fennessy was declared winner, and was
immediately challenged by Squires.

The Whitelaw-Andrews disturbance at Sydney
National Sporting Club last week supplied what looked
like 17 vigorous rounds. Whitelaw was apparently in
dead earnest—rhe was on to Andrews right through,
and in return brother Montague stood in close and hit
with all his might. Andrews had the longer reach and
the superior skill, but Whitelaw was hard as a Christian
money-lender’s heart, and, disregarding Monty’s attacks,
he waded in and struck blows which looked as if they
ought to have killed. And yet it took 17 rounds of
battering, during which Brother Montague was harried
round the ring like a piece of brown paper in a whirl-
wind, before Andrews’ corner hoisted the towel of
unconditional surrender.

Premier Carruthers (N.S.W.) is develop-
ing a capacity for discovering huge, mysterious
undertakings, which threaten to break out at any
moment and provide work for 1,371.429 unem-
ployed. Recently he discovered two in one week.
One is a dark and secret co., that is bringing in
“over £400,000 for investment in developing the
shale industry,” and the other, he “learns, ’ will
work up the rabbit industry, and make a feature
of utilising the by-products, “on an enormous
scale,” at Forbes (N.S.W.). At the same time
Carruthers says that “ capital is being driven out
of this country ”by “socialistic legislation, and
simultaneously he asserts that Socialism is a good
thing that is only possible in Heaven.
Speaking to the people at Ryde (N.S.W.)
Premier Carruthers defended himself in these
words :
He did not object to criticism. There were people who
thought he was going about his work in the wrong way.
“An old dog for a hard road.” Some of those people who
wanted to teach him how to run the show had not been
as many minutes in politics as he had been years.
Theoretically this may be all right, but even a
good theory can be carried too far. When the
dog grows so old that he can’t keep up, and the
people in the waggon can just see him panting on
the rear horizon, they generally think it time to
get a young, fresh dog. And when the dog dis-
appears altogether, and begins to send collect
telegrams from places many miles back asking the
Van of Progress to wait for him, then he becomes
quite superfluous.
Melbourne Age, re our late Hempire and
Prince of Wales mafficks: —
Reasonable people may be excused for feeling, as they
hung out their domestic supply of bunting for the second
time within two weeks, there was a danger of over-doing
the thing. It is better to foster national sentiment by
such universal celebrations as Labor Day and Agricultural
Day, or a harvest thanksgiving festival, than by merely
sectional holidays or birthdays.
The yarn, fathered by G. H. Reid, and
published and republished ad nauseam by the Tory
press during the mail squabble, that the Orient
00. demanded an increased subsidy owing to the
white labor clause in the Postal Act, was given th«
lie direct at the co.’s annual meeting in London
(29/4/’O5). Frederick Green, president of the co.,
S The idea that they had asked for an increased subsidy
owing to this obligation was erroneous. They had simply
wanted a larger subsidy because they had come to the
conclusion that what they had been receiving was not
sufficient. There was very little difference in the cost of
employing white or black crews ; for more black men had
to be employed as they were not so strong as white men,
and the increased number compensated for the higher pay
given to white crews.
Which statement also bursts up that other lie,
patiently and sedulously asserted by Australian
nigger-worshippers, that stoking is a black man s
job. According to Mr. Green —and he ought to
know—the white man is stronger and better fitted
for it than the Lascar. And, as the Orient ships
now carry one-third the old number of stokers, it
seems that the white man is three times as well-
fitted for the job as the Lascar.

Electro-Medical
Institute—
which possesses a Medical Staff of Four Distinguished Qualified Medical Men, whose special studies have been directed towards the
MEN’S DEADLY DESTRUCTIVE DISEASES.
YOUNG, MIDDLE-AGED, or OLD MEN.
Our Specialists ask you to read the following statements
concerning Serious Diseases. They will appeal to you. Jf
you similarly suffer, consult us and be cured.
VARICOCELE.
We can cure this disease without operation, and under our treat-
ment the congested blood vessels, within ten days, disappear.
The parts are restored to their natural condition, vigor and strength,
and circulation is re-established by electricity and electro-medication.
It is the twentieth century treatment.
RUPTURE.
We cure in 30 days, -without operation or hypodermic injection.
No use in wearing trusses. Our treatment is painless, bloodless,
and with no detention from business. Old standing or maltreated
cases especially invited. These, of course, tax all the skill that
science can devise to palliate conditions created by maltreatment,
apathy or neglect. Our methods are those of Continental scientists.
“ WEAKNESS” IN MEN.
Weakness is merely a symptom brought on by early dissipation or
improper treatment of contracted diseases. The cure lies in restoring
the system to its normal healthy state. This we accomplish rapidly
without the use of a long course of internal remedits.
NERVO-VITAL DEBILI l r.
There is certainly no victim of Nervo-Vital Debility but who
hopes to be rejuvenated some time. Our special treatment for this
trouble, varied to suit each case, is an unfailing cure, to which a vast
army of restored men to-day owe their happy condition in life.
URINARY AILMENTS.
We cure without the knife or instrument by an application which
acts directly on the parts affected, dissolving the trouble completely,
by our galvanic electrical medical treatment. It is painless, and in
nowise interferes with your business duties.
KIDNEY TROUBLE.
We cure all irritation, stoppage, pain in back, brickdust sediment,
and catarrhal condition. We cure to stay cured. We do not experi-
ment. Kidney troubles may be deadly destructive. Do not trifle
with them or they will kill you.
PILES.
We cure without operation in 10 days ; no detention from busi-
ness :no acid injection or ligatures used. Electricity and gentle
medication. This system is adopted by the most scientific Conti-
nental practitioners, who have intimately studied these distressing
complications, which are so prevalent in Australia.

Mr. THOS. BROWNE, a resident of Bundaberg, Queensland, thus
describes our treatment:
“ You have worked a most wonderful cure in me, and, although I
am over 60 years of age now, yet now I can beat men of half my years
at the end of the day’s toil. I feel grateful to Mr. George Cooksley
for recommending me to you, but more so to you gentlemen for the
great care bestowed upon my health.”
Mr. P. W. CATES’ (Meekering, West Australia) testimony has
reached us, reading! thus:
“ I am glad of the great improvement following your treatment,
and send this as a testimonial to your professional abilities. There is
only ONE thing that I have against your system, and that is, I shall
have to get new ‘ rigs out,’ for the clothes I had before beginning your
treatment are now far too small. I overheard a conversation between
a Northam doctor and a friend of mine, and the former said I had now
the healthiest face he had ever seen in Northam. This speaks volumes
for the treatment.”
Mr. E. B. HARRIS, of Chinchilla, Queensland, says:—
“ I have much pleasure in attesting the extremely efficacious
treatment given me by the FKEEMAN AND WALLACE INSTITUTE.
I was suffering from acute Nephritis and Hepatic Troubles, but got
no relief from anyone until I wrote and described my case to them.
To-day I am happy and healthy again, and feel it is all due to the
wonderful ability of the Specialists, who were greatly handicapped in
never having seen me, hut had to treat me by their efficient
correspondence system.”
Mr. A. L. KEBY, of Dandenong Road, Melbourne, writes thus:—
“I cannot help expressing my thanks to you for the straight-
forward manner in which you have acted towards me. I had been
ailing for over 12 years, with a cough and bronchitis, and all my
organs were badly deranged ; in fact, six months ago, when I came
to you, I was a complete wreck, suffering from severe weakness. I
can safely state you have done me more good in the six months than
all the doctors and medicine which I tried in the 12 years. I feel
quite a different man, and as Specialists I consider you in the highest
ranks.”

railway—Bigjohn is going about the country
advocating the construction of more railways
by private enterprise. It will cost £1,000,000
to buy the Midland Co. out, and the railway is
not worth half of it. Settlement has been
retarded in that part of the country for years,
simply because the co. charged prohibitive prices
for homestead lots, and then sat down watching
other parts of the State being developed. Bigjohn
favors a line from Albany to Bridgetown, through
fine karri and jarrah forests all the, way, and says
that no difficulty Would be experienced in getting
someone to build the line if timber and some land
were given. But if the State builds the line it
will have the timber and the land as well as the
railway.

Seems to Possess Strange
and Mysterious Power over
Disease.
Offers His Services Free to
the Sick and Afflicted,
Distance no Barrier .
For the past three years accounts have come from
America of the most astonishing nature, regarding
marvellous cures that were being performed daily by the
famous physician and scientist, Dr. James W. Kidd.
At first these stories were received with considerable
doubt, but there continued to come reports of men and
fdh
women being restored to health after years of suffering.
Chronic and so-called incurable invalids were brought
back to perfect health. There seemed no affliction or
disease but what he might cure. Thousands of patients
were treated by the doctor until his name and the fame
of his marvellous remedies spread all over the civilized
world. Investigation has proved every assertion made by
Dr. Kidd. Some of the stories told and letters received
from grateful patients seem to indicate that this man’s
remedies possess a mysterious pow<»s 2~i£ase. No
matteLhow. tub case, how chronic, or how long
standing, what other men have said or failed to do. These
are the cases he especially solicits, because they give him
a chance to prove his superior ability.
When asked the secret of his success, the doctor
modestly answers that it is partly due to the wonderful
remedies which he uses and partly to the careful attention
given each case. He treats patients all over the civilized
world by mail, and seems equally as successful as though
they were present in his office. His greatest ambition is
to give every sick, afflicted and suffering man and woman
in the world a chance to try his wonderful treatment. In
an interview recently the doctor said: “I believe that
I, have discovered a way to relieve most of the suffering
from sickness and disease in the world, and I believe that
it is my duty as far as possible to make this fact known to
all. For this reason, lam offering to send a free treat-
ment to every applicant, rich or poor, no matter where
they live, no matter what their disease. lam not a rich
man. I cannot afford to always give my medicine away,
but I am going to continue as long as possible or until
every afflicted person has had a chance to try and satisfy
themselves without expending one penny.” Do you
mean that you will send treatment absolutely free to every
one who applies? was asked. “That is exactly what I
mean. Any sick or afflicted person who will write to me
and describe their condition may have a trial of this treat-
ment entirely free. There are no conditions, no restric-
tion. Distance is no barrier. I cure as readily thousands
of miles away as in my office. A letter does just as well
as a personal visit.”
The above statement appeared in all the leading
American papers and from there to the English press. As
a result Dr. Kidd’s mail has been flooded with applications
for free treatment. All have been answered promptly,
but still they continue to come. For the benefit of his
thousands of patients in the British Empire the doctor has
been compelled to establish an office in London. To
secure a free treatment, it is only necessary to address Dr.
James W. Kidd, 486 Saracen Buildings, Snow Hill, London,
E. 0., being sure to describe your case. Remember that
the doctor treats all diseases from the simplest and
easiest cured to the so-called incurable and chronic
afflictions. There is no disease that he may not cure.
In view of. Dr. Kidd’s marvellous success, his standing
among America’s most famous physicians, his reputation
for honesty and integrity, this offer affords a remarkable
opportunity to all who are sick and in need of medical
help. It means a chance to get well. It means the
opinion and advice of one of the world’s most famous and
successful physicians on your case absolutely free.

ti Moreing and Co. intend to have a
shy ” at the new Dolcoath tin mine, Zeehan way (Tas.).
This is the property that shone out in th<* action between
Adams, a local journalist, and Trevis Moore, in which
Adams claimed an interest in the co. The penman won,
and if B.M. decide to put up cash there will be one more
ink-slinger safe. Hertzig has been round with a pickaxe
and a sample-bag at the mine, on behalf of the firm, and
great things are expected locally. Lode tin is a doubtful
quantity, and Heemskirk and Dundas mines have not
built up a reputation like. John Moffatt’s V.ulcan, up
North. Still, a little boodle might be worse employed
than in suggested by Hertzig to his principals.
There is not much frill about the directors of the
North Mt. Farrell (Tas.). All they were getting was 15s.
a week among six, and they wanted a rise to £75 per six
months. No one grudges them a living wage, much less
a little froth on the top of the pewter; they deserve
reward if only because of the model little balance-sheet
and report they turn out. They have also gone
‘ joint-and-several ’’ for the co.—a thing a man only does
when he believes in a mine; and they have put
the co. on the perch among the few profit-earning mines
of little Tassy. Costs last half-year worked out at 21s.
2id. per ton of crudes (including ss. Id. for development),
against 21s. 6Jd. for the preceding half-year; and net
profits were 7s. 3Jd., against Is. Bid. Mine to date has
yielded 96,583 tons, of the average value of £8 7s. 9d.
Directors want to bring in water from the Lake at the
top of Mt. Farrell to work the plant for half the year, and
so bring costs down.

At No. 10 level of Great Fingall (W.A.), reef
splits 590 ft. north of shaft, but both branches are in pay
ore, hanging wall branch being worth 22dwt. for 6ft. wide
and 100 ft. long, footwall branch being worth 20dwt. for
Bft. wide and 160 ft. long. No. 11 north was barren for
173 ft., but for next 600 ft. was wide and payable. Develop-
ments are so far ahead of mill, and costs are now so low
that no anxiety is warranted at present. Capital expen-
diture is completed, so divs. must be big. Pay shoot
pitches north, therefore every subsequent level will have
further to drive through barren ground, of which bears
will make all capital possible.

Latest reported is from Invincible Extended, Siberia—
-8340z. from 13 tons. Mine is situated in Wealth of
Nations district, which is not much heard of now-a-days,
though a few fossickers are still mooning about there.
Outred and party, who got this rich return, have been
plugging away there for past ten vears.

Northern Blocks Syndicate (W.A.) was formed
m May, 1903, with a capital of 350,000 shares of Is. each
to prospect three outside blocks of Associated Northern!
This prospecting failed, and work was suspended with
half the capital intact. Three months ago concern took
six months’oplion on Great Leviathan, six miles south of
Southern Cross. Kenny, its prospector, got very rich
stone near surface, but was not able to tackle deep sink-
ing. At 160 ft. reef has been cut, 4ft. wiab, worth 35dwt.
Drive continues in good ore, and, if next three months’
prospecting confirms this, syndicate will take over the
property. In addition, prospecting of Medindie Hill with
diamond drill has been resumed. This hill is east of
Brown Hill, and in direct line and adjoining Brown Hill
Extended’s eastern lode on north.
♦ * * *
Hainault, Kalgoorlie, has been doing well
lately, but output is being pushed for all it is worth. A
year ago reserves were given as 140,000 tons of 7dwt. ore
and returns practically confirm this. In April grade of
ore increased to Sdwt., and profits jumped from £l3OO to
£l9OO. Developments didn’t foreshadow this increase
and many believe that mine is being forced to let those
speculators who hold bulk of scrip unload. Co.’s financial
year closes on May 31, and it is said that Is. div. will
shortly be declared. May profits may run up to £2500 ;
but scrippers had better be vary, as unloading by insiders
is bound to follow any rise.
* * * *
The mostly-Adelaide people who were going to
float into great riches on a stream of oil in Taranaki
(M.L.) have given up the idea. They bored 2000 ft. or so
(which was a good deal deeper than their expert told them
they would need to go), got the usual “ indications,” and
then came to the same conclusion as scores of others who
have tried the game—that there wasn’t any money in it
Still the local (New Plymouth) people haven’t lost all
hope, and, with £ for £ help from the Government pro-
pose to probe a bit further, and settle the matter still
more definitely.

H. Y. L. Brown, the cautious S. Aus. State
geologist, has had a look at the new tinfield near Port
Darwin (N.T.), where Hang Gong and some other Chinese
parties have made a comfortable rise. Tin country covers
about 5 sq. miles ; and deepest workings are about 20ft.
Tin ore is in granite dykes, which have shed some of their
metal. Brown says the dykes are irregular and the tin
patchy ; “ nevertheless I am of opinion that some at least
continue tin-bearing in depth, and large quantities of tin
are likely to be obtained from this area.” He hasn’t often
written anything more definite and emphatic than that.

Two more Boer war heroes have gone to
gaol in Melbourne. Judge Molesworth called it
robbery and cowardly assault on an elderly man,

A Sydney hat manufacturer, who went
before the Tariff Commission and asked for more
Protection, said he knew skilled hatters who, not
finding work at their own trade, were now wharf-
lumping. Australia won’t give them work making
hats ; it only gives them the job of dragging out
of the foreign ship some of the £427,876 worth of
foreign hats and caps which were imported last
year. And the Argus and the Telegraph, and
the rest of the Freetrade crowd who howled them-
selves hoarse because six hatters were kept wait-
mg in a comfortable ship for a day or two while
their boss filled in some necessary forms, don’t
raise even half a howl when the same hatters are
kept waiting for weary years on the wharves. In
fact, it is the Argus and the D.T. and the Free-
trade crowd who keep them waiting. ’

Stomach Troubles ” and How He was Cured.
Millions of men and women are to-day suffering
the tortures of pain from various diseases, but
there are few among them all who can and do
describe correctly the symptoms of their disorders.
m.L W inni e I s a l of so recent date as December
Jth, 1904, from Thomas Frederick Watts, in which
he describes so clearly what he felt that anyone
who has similar symptoms can tell at once what
™ probabilities are of securing benefit from
Mother Seigel’s Syrup, the same remedy that Mr.
v\ atts used. Read the letter for yourself :
t £ two y ears , an d ten months back since
i first fell ill. I went right off ray food and was
unable to sleep. My strength ebbed away until I
became pitiably weak. The little food I ate
punished me dreadfully, and I was never free from
pam and aches. My tongue was furred and my
throat so sore that it hurt me to swallow even a
mouthful of water. I thought my heart was
aiiected, as it fluttered and beat most irregularly
and was subject to spasms of intense pain. I
became so thin and feeble that I could scarcely
walk, and finally had to give up my employment.
I was then attending the Sydney Hospital as an
out-door patient, and was being treated forindiges-
tion and general debility. I also had a gargle for
my throat. But in spite of all they could do for
me at the hospital I grew steadily worse, and
began to give up all hopes of ever getting right
a & ain- I had been unable to work for ten weeks,
when a fellow-patient, who was being treated at
the hospital for injuries received accidentally,
strongly urged me to try Seigel’s Syrup. Though
1 really thought it .useless, I bought a bottle on
my way home. To my delight, after taking it for
a tew days only, I began to pick up rapidly. The
soreness left my throat, my heart-action became
regular, and I could eat without fear. I kept on
taking the medicine, and was soon back at my
work and thoroughly cured.”
Mr. Watts has lived at 168, Henderson-road,
Alexandria, Sydney, since 1890, and is an
Australian by birth, and well and favorably
known m the community where he resides.*

It is officially denied from Maoriland that Miss Nellie
Stewart has been seriously ill there. In fact, it is stated
with much force and circumstance that the brilliant lady
has been “lately in better health than for months past.'”
“ K.”: Dan Barry (may his shadow never grow less !
may [ have broken up his organisation as stated (B. 8/6/’O5)
but if so he has gathered his forces together again, and is
trotting around Melbourne suburbs, the same old Dan as
of yore, but perhaps a trifle more energetic. His red and
yellow posters are air over Camberwell and elsewhere

“Hamer”: “Carbon’s’’explanation (B. 8/6/’O5) of the
Broken Hill hooting of the Governor is probably the
correct one. In most country places people who go to
fche , fro Ti t are greeted with cat-calls from the sportiv e
gods. The only man writer knows who could deal with
the turbulent deities effectively was advance-agent
Anderson. He had a dog—a fine, well-conditioned,

“II exham ” : Professional musician O’Brien, writing to
a Sydney daily, says the Bavarian band engaged at
Wave Hey tother day could not play “ Gor Save,” &c.
Must lie mistake. The air of the official Sauerkraut Im-
perial hymn is the same as that of “ Gor Save,” as is also
the Swiss national air, and a Bavarian band that didn’t
know Kaiser William’s hymn would have its trombone
confiscated for lese majesty.
Premier Bent, of Victoria, in his role of comic singer at
Ballarat, yelled in an outrageous voice a couple of Dick
Thatcher s old-time melodies. Thatcher (oft mentioned
in The Bulletin) was a singer of the ’so’s, and a great
favorite on the goldfields, particularly at Bendigo. He
wrote.verses.on topical events to faniiliar airs, and sang
“ 111 a Volce quite unlike Bent’s. It was characteristic
of Thomas to select “ The Bathing in Bullock Creek ” for
rendition before a mixed audience: The song relates an
incident which cast a gloom and a disrespectful feeling
overthe city long, long ago. It is descriptive of a picnic
of theatricals and important Bendigonians to Bullock
Creek. The men wandered off, leaving the ladies by
themselves, but rushed back on hearing terrible screams.
Then they found that the ladies had taken a dip in the
waters of the creek, and were covered with voracious
leeches. It is a very nude melody after that. Thatcher
described the. incident in song the same evening to a
strictly male audience. Bent, the Blunderbore of Aus-
tralian politics, sang the same shrieking ditty to an audi-
ence of eminently respectable fathers and mothers, and
their unmarried daughters, in the Princess Theatre.
Dramatic critic Metcalfe, of New York Life, is still
fighting the Theatrical Syndicate, and he is helped bv the
Drama™ Mirror, David Belasco, and others. Be'lasco
takes the field at latest. A few months ago the syndicate
published an official declaration that it would crush
Belasco and drive him out of business in 90 days. A day
or two after, all the stage hands engaged upon Belasco’s
new play Sweet Kitty Bellairs” suddenly left the
theatre, for no stated reason. Next day they were
employed by the Syndicate Theatres. This happened at
Washington. A fortnight later, upon returning to New
York to produce his play, Belasco found that the ropes in
his fly-gallery had been fouled, knotted, twisted, snarled
and tangled. Again he was deserted by his trusted
tT 0 P n2' eeS ’ W? r? r ? r - e ? dayB and ni £ hts his staunch
friends worked like bricks untangling ropes, etc., and
getting the piece ready for production. “ Kitty ” was an
enormous success. “ And,” concludes Belasco, in a state-
ment to the N. Y. Dramatic Mirror, “ I ask all who have
the interest of the theatre at heart, and are familiar with
the oppressive conditions under which it is struggling to
maintain its life as an art, to judge whether, after “Mr.

MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injuies the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the naaal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? It- so, try

Transpired in Queensland Supreme Court
the other day that it has been oustomary by some
employers of Kanaka labor to deduct from their

by sickness or accident. And the poor nigger’s
pay varies from £6 to about £l2 per year.
“J. A.C.” : Re the alleged cleanliness of
the Japanese. The authoress of “Unbeaten
Tracks in Japan.” wrote thus, 25 years ago,
about the population of some remote inland
districts:—
These people wear no linen, and their clothes, which
are seldom washed, are constantly worn, night and day,
as long as they will hold together. They seal up their
houses as hermetically as they can at night, and herd
together in numbers in one sleeping-room, With its
atihdsphferb vitiated, to begin with, by charcoal and
tobacco fumes, huddled in their dirty garments, in
wadded quilts which are kept during the day in close
Clipboards, and are seldom washed from one year’s end to
the other. The tatami (mats) beneath a tolerably fair
exterior swarm with insect life, and are receptacles of
dust, organic matter, etc. The hair, which is loaded with
oil and bandoline, is dressed once a week, or less often in
these districts, and it is unnecessary to enter into any
details regarding the distressing results. The persons of
the people, especially of the children, are infested with
vermin, and one fruitful source of skin sores is the
irritation arising from this cause.
“ C.C.H.” : Have come to the conclusion
that small men are greater swearers than big men.
My theory is : A big fellow need only say, “Go
and do so-and-so,” and it is dono ; a little chap has
to say, “ Go and do so-and-so, damn you ! ” and
perhaps it isn’t done even then.
“ Wilhelmina S.” : A culchawed insurance
clerk gave me the information that those in
“business” left their employment at five ; those
at “ work ” left at six. This throws some light on
the difference between the gentleman who has
just accepted a position and the fellow who has
got a job.
Two or three secret murder societies have
lately introduced a gory element of romance into
the life of the Italian colony in San Francisco.
When the amputated head of a signor is taken to
the morgue, the trouble is to get any of its rela-
tives and friends to swear to it. They just look
and shudder, and say nothing, lest the chairman
of the association that decreed the murder should
mark the “informer” for slaughter. A Sicilian
who was chopped to pieces in San Francisco, the
other week, is said to have paid the penalty o.
having raised a subscription for burying a previous
signor who was murdered. Seems that the
mangled corpse of anybody whose name ended in
an “ o” while he was alive is a matter to be care-
fully ignored.


A Chinese Journal states, In its description of a concert
giv en =t Hone Kong- by Frledenthal—the man with the
monkey-that it is difficult to understand how lovers of
music can make hideous noises by drumming on the
ground with sticks and clapping their hands.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated ; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be disooloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don't say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

How tragic, then, when
the little one has to spend
the happy days of child-
hood on a bed of sick-

ailments, which render it languid

an anxiety to its parents. If all

bv the aid of Scott’s Emulsion of

I obtained this for my two boys aged

a nasty troublesome cough and cold: the

and in two days the cough and cold of the younger
boy had entirely disappeared, having been cut short
in good time, and at the end of the third day the elder
boy was absolutely cured.
Being a Chemist for seventeen years, I am naturally
somewhat antagonistic to proprietary and patent medicines,
but in this instance I must recognise and acknowledge the
efficiency and merit of your excellent preparation, and give
credit where credit is due. I was greatly pleased with the
marvellous and striking curative and soothing properties of your
admirable remedy, which I will add, from a pharmaceutical stand-
point, is splendidly compounded.—Yours faithfully,

A spell in a private hospital is coming' to be entered up

Nance O’Neil, it is reported, is bringing a complete com-
pany with her. The last time the lady was in Australasia,
a locally-recruited member of the company got the
horrors on the way over from Maoriland, and, with a shirt
clothing his thinness, and a razor in his hand, chased the
ample lady into hysterics. Perhaps that incident has
given her a bias against Australian actors.
“Mao B.": Was present one night at a literary-
medico’s house when Carrie Haase electrified a small
audience by her wonderful impersonation of Lady
Macbeth. It was the sleep-walking scene, and Carrie’s
mother afterwards remarked to me that she could not
realise that Carrie was her daughter ; never thought she
could be so terrible. Wilson Barrett had a very high
opinion of Miss Haase’s ability.
At New York, recently, Louise Thorndyke Boucicault
was married to YV. G. Cheney. He is her third husband.
Dion Boucicault the elder met Louise Thorndyke in
Australia, and, after obtaining an American divorce from
his first wife (Agnes Robertson), married her. Bouci-
cault’s first wife would not recognise the divorce, but
was unsuccessful in an action against him, and also in
contesting his will. After Boucicault died, Louise Thorn-
dyke married again, but obtained a divorce last year.
George IV., as Prince Regent, and Mrs. Fitzherbert,
appear with astonishing vraisemblance in Mack’s Tom
Moore play. George married Mrs. Fitzherbert, according
to the rites cl' her church, the Roman Catholic. The
news got abroad and made a frightful row. George put
up Fox to deny it, in the House of Commons. He gave
Fox his word of honor that the marriage had never taken
place. George IV.’s mistresses included Ladies Conyng-
ham, Jersey, and Hertford. He worshipped his old
clothes, and never would part with any. The whole
wondrous collection remained after his demise. In the
pockets there was £lO,OOO scattered over almost innumer-
able pocket-books which he had forgotten.
The plot of a new playlet staged in London, the other
week, is an amusing example of artificial dramatic effect.
An ambitious artist is promised the hand of his best girl
if he can get a picture accepted at the Royal Academy.
He chooses for his subject “ The Outcast,” and takes his
boozy brother Bob as the ideal model. Bob has a capital
outcast appearance, and the great work is getting along
nicely until Mrs. Bob begins to reform her husband. Next
time he sits he is a sober, decent-looking model, so his
brother lures him back to the bottle in the interests of
art, restores him to the ranks of picturesque outcasts,
and completes the portrait with a few brilliant strokes of
his inspired paint-brush. Then the moral climax. Indig-
nant Mrs. Bob destroys the picture, and the best girl
discards her loving artist in disgust at his conduct.
Probably she fears that if she were to marry him he would
incite her to beer and put her on canvas as “ A Fallen
Angel,” or murder her to get, a good corpse model. The
cockney audience is said to have been deeply impressed
by this play. ’Arry and ’Arriet accept it as a painful
reflection on the depravity of Art.
“0.K.”: The speech that Rickards delivers to his “ kind
patrons ” from the stage when he is about to make another
of his periodical trips to Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America in search of “the latest novelties, ladies and
gentlemen,” is, to my way of thinking, an excellently
harmonious utterance. It blends Rickards, the old-time
coster impersonator, with. Rickards, the manager (past
and present), and lays them like flattering unction to the
soul of the kind patrons. The style of the speech hasn’t
varied in the last 20 years, but long practice has given it
more ease, fluency, and point than of yore, without
diminishing its warmth of ’eart. It is a speech that
prompts one to exclaim, “ Good old ’Arry ! ” Heard him
again the other night at Melbourne Opera House, and
noted how he struck right ’ome to the audience’s ’eart—
the “very bottom, of its ’eart” so to speak—by an-
nouncing that for the future he would engage only ex-
pensive turns abroad, having come to the conclusion that
he could find plenty of bright young local artists who
would please his kind patrons better than second and
third rate performers such as he had previously imported
by the half-dozen for make-weight purposes.
This comes to hand from a Melbourne contributor. Thb
Bulletin hasn’t the least idea what it is about, but it
seems to be partly a Soul Wail, partly a Shriek, and
partly an Impression. Most of all, it seems to be a Tall
Pale Howl: —“ Cobb’s coach was flying through the city
to-day by way of advt. for a show—the St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital Fete. Cabbage Tree Ned was up, and his quartette
of spankers galloped like those of Stein’s fire-escape.
Inside were G. V. Brooke, Coppin, Joey Gougenheim,
Fanny Oathcart, Charley Young, and the managers of the
Bank of Australasia, Bank of Victoria, Colonial Bank,
and Bank of Elegance, each with a thousand sovereigns.
The Escort galloped around. ‘ Hey up ! ’ shouted Cabbage-
Tree Ned. Away went the coach out at the north end of
Elizabeth-street. At Keilor the panting horses were
taken out, and a much inferior-looking team substituted,
but rare ’uns to go ! The lame one turned out the best of
all. Soon they came to the Corduroy. Bump went a
bank manager’s cranium through the oilskin top, and he
only laughed. However, he didn’t think it so funny
when they passed Velvet Ned and three other Garibaldi-
shirted horsemen, in the Black Forest.”
“Yarrab”: “The Pierrot” (B. 18/5/’O5) is rather con-
fined in his knowledge of things theatrical when speaking
of William Anderson, lessee and manager of Sydney
Palace. W.A. is no neophyte as an entrepreneur. When
only a fledgling he was connected with the Princess
Theatre, Bendigo ; and fully 12 years ago he managed
that' versatile trio, Gourlay, Walton and Shine. Then
followed the successful tours of George Leitch, Grattan
Riggs, George Darrell, Alfred Dampier, Maggie Moore and
other well-known stars through all the principal Victorian
towns. Eleven years ago he took a pantomime company
(curiously enough called “ Sinbad the Sailor,” and iden-
tical in title with the one he is now running through
Groperland) on a tour through Victoria—his troupe
consisting of 60 people. Nine years ago we find him, in
conjunction with Charles Holloway, lessee of the old
Alexandra in Melbourne, and just after that time he
figured in a managerial capacity with George Rignold,
when the latter successfully toured Australia. In 1899
he opened—John F. Sheridan being the star—at Sydney
Lyceum ; and, at the same time, he and Holloway were
running a company at the Melbourne Royal. Since then
his ventures have been many and varied ; and to-day he
is simultaneously running companies in New South Wales,
Maoriland, Victoria and Westralia. Surely such a record
can hardly be spanned by the space of “ about five
years.”
Sydney Zoological Society does not advance with the
societies in other States, and occasionally has to sell an
elephant or a lion to raise money to buy old horse for the
other animals. The trouble is, of course, finance ; but
without improving the gardens it is difficult to see how
the society will earn more, and, barring the acquisition of
a few cheap bears and ostriches, the show seems to have
declined instead of improved of late years. The society
wants more land and an experienced theatrical man—one
who will have every animal in the grounds capable of it
saddled up, the monkeys schooled to play cricket, and
each beast trained to do its turn. Matinee days and gala
nights would draw crowds; and the Polar bear in his
famous high dive, the chimpanzee troupe of acrobats in
their swing act, and the ship of the desert at sixpence a
ride might pull the finances out of the mud in no time.
The blackballing of Ellen Terry for the Lyceum
gromen’s) Club has caused Mrs. Craigie (“ John Oliver
obbes”) to resign her membership. The ostensible reason
for the blackballing was that Ellen Terry had not written
anything, but Mrs. Craigie asserts that she has published
several articles on Shakspeare, while some of the black-
balling cats have “ merely written a paragraph or so for
a fashion paper.” John Oliver delivered this burst of
scorn from the lofty pinnacle of a dozen novels and half-
a-dozen plays, with the limelight full on—for she loves it
as dearly as any actress,
A crowd of supers is generally as queer a conglomera-
tion of human atoms as fortune can gather together. It
often includes ex-bank managers, solicitors, remittance
men, disqualified jockeys, sailors, and an odd mixture of
all trades, generally Wasters. There are a few stage-
struck enthusiasts with aspirations for a theatrical career.
There is a well-known old super in Sydney who was 15
years ago a highly-esteemed bank manager, and several
who have established record times in getting through
money. ; j
At Balmain (N.S. W.) it cost the council
£BOO more for scavenging by contract during 1904
than in either of two previous years under day
labor. Balmain is the shabby, overcrowded suburb
which returns Bill Wilks to the Federal and S. J.
Law to the State Parliament because they are
Orangemen, and it is said that the local council is
also run on strict sectarian lines. If so, no won-
der the ratepayers suffer. And they deserve to
suffer. Any fool who votes a man into an Aus-
tralian public body because of the Boyne Water
or the Walls of Derry, is such a mischievous fool
as to merit any sort of misfortune.
Mr. Frederic Manning, of Sydney, has
been writing to London Outlook, combating the
Stinking Fish cry:—
I would protest against a paragraph in your paper on
the subject of Australian mails, in which you refer, pre-
sumably to the Australian Labor party, as “ the forces of
political larrikinism.” Larrikins we certainly have, too
abundantly, among our politicians, and I am neither a
partisan nor an apologist of the Labor party; but in
common-fairness to them I should like to point out to you
that they have never allowed the prospect of personal
gain to influence them, and that they are the only political
organisation in Australia of which that can be said.

Restoration to Health.
(By “Sano.”)
One of the supremest joys of life is the experience of full-blooded health after one has suffered
bodily pain for a lengthy period, especially when the illness has been of such a nature that nearly all
hope of recovery has been abandoned. In these days of strict attention to hygiene, diet, and physical
culture, the maintenance of good health has been reduced to a science, and it is comparatively easy to
remain well and fit when once in proper form, whilst there are a large number of disorders that afflict
humanity which now can be avoided, or readily cured, if the origin of such disorders is understood.
It is quite common, still, to regard Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel, and
Stone, Bladder Troubles, Biliousness, Indigestion, Jaundice, Sick Heahache, Anaemia, General
Debility, and most blood disorders as being of a specific nature, each calling for independent treat-
ment, when, in fact, all of these disorders have their origin in an inefficient action of the kidneys and
liver. The importance of the work which nature has apportioned to the kidneys and liver will be
more fully realised by a short account of their respective functions.
The kidneys of the average person filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine
every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains
in weight of uric acid, and other animal and mineral matter varying from the third of an ounce to
nearly an ounce. If the kidneys are working freely and healthily all this solid matter leaves the body
dissolved in the urine, but if, through weakness or disease, the kidneys are unable to do their work
properly, a quantity of these urinary substances remains in the blood and flows through the veins,
contaminating the whole system. Then we suffer from some form of uric poisoning such as Rheumatism,
Gout, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, Gravel, Stone and Bladder
Troubles. A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are healthy is to place some urine, passed
the first thing of a morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until next morning. If it is then
cloudy, shows a sediment like brick-dust, is of an unnatural color, or has particles floating about in it,
the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be taken to restore their vigor, or
Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many manifestations of uric poisoning will result.
The liver is an automatic chemical laboratory. In the liver various substances are actually made
from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made by the liver every day. The liver takes
sugar from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it
to the blood, as the latter may require enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble,
into urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles which have
lived their life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from some
form of biliary poisoning such as Indigestion, Biliousness, Anaemia, Jaundice, Sick Headache, General
Debility, and Blood Disorders.
So intimate is the relation between the work done by the kidneys and that done by
the liver, that where there is any failure on the part of the kidneys, the liver becomes
affected in sympathy and vice versa. It was the realisation of the importance of this
close union of the labor of those vital organs which resulted in the discovery of the medicine
now known throughout the world as Warner’s Safe Cure. Certain medical men, knowing
what a boon it would be to humanity if some medicine could be found which would act s peeifically on
both the kidneys and the liver, devoted themselves to an exhaustive search for such a medium, and
their devotion was eventually rewarded by their success in compounding a medicine which possesses
the required quality in the fullest degree. Warner’s Safe Cure exhibits a marvellous healing action in
all cases of functional or chronic disease of the kidneys and liver, and restoring them, as it is able to
do,- to health and activity, it, of necessity, cures all complaints due to the retention in the system of
urinary and biliary poisons. A vigorous action of the kidneys and liver naturally eliminates the
poisons, and troubles due to the presence of the poisons cease. Cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure
are permanent simply because they are natural. [9].

Sixty Miles Away.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE little clock clicked on apace, and yet the
rain fell still;
And from my warm, thick pillow I could
hear
The dreary drops drop endlessly upon the wooden
sill
And the wet gum-boughs shuddering with fear ;
While ever in my mind I saw the wrinkled,
shallow pool,
Though sixty miles by hill and dale away,
Where round and round the body of the poor, self-
slaughtered fool
Swirled in the windy, yellow-water spray.
And then, again, the urgent mouth, the breath,
the gypsy hair _ f -
Of her who, sleeping at my side, did lean
Her body’s bribe for all this sin and merciless
despair—
“Ah, God! What penance, say, can make me
clean ? ”
And still the rain fell down, and still the wind, all
big and wroth,
Stormed in the chimney like an angry sprite—
When on my cheek there crept from off the
counterpane a moth
In search of company and warmth and light.
Anon. I shook the horrid thing to earth, and
heard it fall
Upon the carpet near the great white bed,
Whence soon it, whirring, rose and fastened at the
plastered wall
But scarce a hand’s breadth from the woman’s
head.
It was the kind of Moth which Death has marked
out for his own,
And through my veins there came a sudden sense
Of murder to be done. Fate at my feet his gage
: had thrown.
And no escape lay anyway from hence.
And once again I saw, though sixty miles by hill
and dale away.
By hill and dale, the wrinkled shallow pool
Where round and round, backward and fore, be-
spent by spuming water-spray,
There swirled the poor unwept self-slaughtered
fool.
The rest was certain : Guided by the Moth, now
at her throat,
Charr’d black upon the silver of her skin,
I sped her spirit, scarlet, to old Charon’s wherry-
boat, 1 ' ■;
And gave Corruption easy entrance in. ’ ,
The little cldck clicked, on apace, and yet the rain
felt still,
A nil from my warm, thick pillow I could lica/r
The dreary drops drop endlessly upon the wooden
sill—
And the wet gum-boughs shuddering with fear.

Dingoes I Have Met.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f SPHERE be many sorts of dingoes, the
black, the spotted, the brindle, the yellow;
but all live and work the same way—by
cunning. The plain and forest dingoes hunt in
small packs, to master the big game there; the
scrub dingoes hunt in pairs, the game only afford-
ing a meal for two; the town dingo singly, so that
none shall share the spoil.
I met my first dingo one morning in the creek.
We had all wagged it from school to go swimming,
gleaning from Aunt’s sorghum and melon patch on
the way. A big log spanned the swimming hole,
and made a slippery bridge when the creek was
up. As we sunned ourselves under it after a
hearty lunch of melon and “ sugar, ” a big, gaunt
dingo trotted oilt of the' bush and paused in the
log-middle to look round. He was yellow, with a
black back and a ferocious head. We all yelled
together, thinking how funny it would be to see
him go crashing into the bush on the other side.
He made one scared bound, slipped on the log,
and next minute was snapping savagely amongst
us. A couple of the smallest kids got trampled
into the mud in the struggle; then the weaker-
minded broke back to the school and told on us.
Heavens! how the teacher belted us next
morning. ‘ ... v - i •
Then Aunt sent Bill up to the selection to live,
and she also sent some of her pet poddies up to
be weaned. One day when I was there, wag-
ging it as usual, we heard the calves’ blare; a big
bitch dingo had the apple of Aunt’s eye down, and
was trying to drag it into the bush for her pups.
Bill let go his old musket at her. When the
smoke cleared away, the bitch was speeding into
the bush, and aunt’s prize poddy was kicking its
last on the ground. Bill got there first and stood
looking thoughtfully at it, his foot on its forehead.
I could see no bite 3. Bill thought the fright must
have killed it.
“ There she is again,” I shouted excitedly. Bill
turned round sharply, forgetting to keep his foot
still. There was a neat bullet-hole in the calf’s
forehead.
“Lor!” said Bill, in a dazed way, “the bullet
must ’a glarnced hoff. I alius heerd as" they
dingoes were tough.”
We buried it under a peach tree in the garden.
I had Bill under the whip after that.
A little afterwards I invested ss. in a half-bred ;
a selector near by, Who was breeding pups for the
scalp-bounty, sold him to me. This bitch was--
something of a kangaroo dog and something of a
collie ; he assured me the pup would be a ringer,
the father being my old friend of the log.
I called the pup Tiger. He turned out a great
cattle-dog, though he insisted on going away
bunting every now and again. I had lost' him
for a couple of days this way, when I went over to
gee a selector whose place fronted our new road.
The unemployed were then joyfully skimming it
o.ver (on borrowed money). It lay between Camp-
belltown and Bulli. .
Yarning in the hut (the selector was sixty and
I was ninje), swopping opinions about Rarkes, we
heard the patter of feet outside. Before we could
get to the door, the unemployed’s road-boss had
darted in upon us like a hunted devil, knocking
my host into the fire. It took three nips of
“ still ” whisky to bring him round ; then he told
his story. He was walking down the road by
himself, when he was suddenly bailed up by a
ferocious brindle dingo as big as a mastiff. After
a life and death struggle, weaponless, he had
strangled it barehanded, then, feeling faint, he
had run down to us.
He had barely finished when we heard some-
thing else pattering towards the hut; next
moment a large yellow dog, with pricked ears, hove
in sight.
“ It's’im again,” yelled the road-boss, and fell
under the bunk. The dog trotted into the hut,
and lay down sleepily at my feet. It was good
old Tiger.
He was a demon to fight, and had such a repu-
tation that no dog in Liverpool or Campbelltown
would tackle,him. Many a Sunday morning did
he uphold his supremacy in the backyards there ;
I became quite a noted character as “ th’ nipper
wot owns th’ yaller fightin’ dorg.” Next to Aunt’s
game fowls, which Bill used to bring in muffled in
a soojee-bag, the steels clinking in his pocket, and
fight against other fanciers’ birds during church-
time, I was easily the most notable character in
the district. I lost Tiger two years later. I saw
my friend, the dingo-breeder, going into town with
a bundle of scalps, and noticed one amongst them
marvellously like Tiger’s.
The next one I struck was in Lower George-
street. I was 14, and wanted to buy a beagle-
hound (greyhounds had gone out). No. one in
Liverpool or Campbelltown was complete without
a few in those days, and I wanted to be in the
fashion. With los. of hard silver I boldly adver-
tised for “ choice bloodhound or beagle bitch, must
be young,” and was snapped up by Lower George-
street. Went down with a light heart and a
strong chain in my pocket.
The fat old dealer eyed me up and down, and
then led out a blear-eyed, rusty old thing with no
teeth.
“Pretty as paint,” he said, heartily. “Ain’t
she a beauty?”
“Pretty old,” I answered, looking at her gums.
“What do you want for her?”
“ Only twenty-five bob,” he purred, as if giving
her away.
“I’ll give you eighteeenpence,” I said, readily.
This disgusted him.
“ Bah,” he snarled, kicking the old thing to the
back of the shop again, where the smells Were
strongest, “you don’ wanter buy a dog; you
wanter steal one.”
“Well,” I retorted, getting near the door, “if
I couldn't steal a better one than that I’d drown
myself.”
So, we parted.
I Worked for a dingo for a while. He had a
briissplate up, “ J. Skinnem, Financier,” and a
beautiful ad. in the papers, offering to lend money
without security, as he was a Christian gentleman,
arid didn’t want any prpfit. The constant inrush
of the sold-up widows and orphans got on my
nerves, so I left him and went selecting in the
Warrio scrub.
• ■ Thedirstr’sefection I took up was full of dingoes.
They used to howl round the hut at night, and
creep into the beef-cask if I left the door open. I
shot several in self-defence. After that they left
me in peace for a couple of months, till one night
I heard the. familiar crunching of bones outside.
Peering through a orack in the slabs, I saw a
dingo, pure white he was, fleckless. Made up my
mind to catch him, and left scraps outside for the
purpose. He got quite tame, but as soon as the
hut door creaked would disappear like white mist,
to show himself against the moon on a tangled
network of charred logs 50 yards away.
Nothing would induce him to come inside the
hut and be caught, so at last I got full of him.
“ Come in here, you coward,” I shouted, angrily,
in dingo language. “ I won’t hurt you, you fool. ”
“No fear,” he answered, from the logs; “I
don’t like the look of that rope you’ve got. You
might sell me to the Zoo., or something equally
horrible. I had a brother got caught that way
once ; took him three years to get loose again. If
you’ll come out and sit on this log, I don’t mind
having a yarn with you.”
Being an albino, he told me, was not all fun.
‘ ‘ You’re so noticeable, ” he explained. * ‘ Liable
to get shot any minute. Then the turkeys and
paddymelons can spot you so easily, sneaking on
them ; and if you go near a hut, the fools always
try to catch you for a curiosity. If I were a
brindle now ” he sighed enviously.
We got quite friendly, though he would never
come inside the hut. He stopped with me for a
couple of months, and used to keep me posted
about the best places for turkeys and flock-pigeons ;
then he disappeared suddenly, and I never knew
what became of him.
I left this selection, and took one nearer human
beings, where I saw cedar-getters once a week.
The dingoes were scarcer, the only troublesome
one being a big brindle brute with flop ears. His
mother had apparently been chased (and caught)
by a mastiff. This beggar used to stalk me about
the scrub in the day-time, and howl dolorously
round the hut at night, just outside the palings.
He would escort me home from scrub-falling every
night, just beyond rifle-shot, on the off-chance of
my getting bushed. (All ways are one in the
scrub when the sun goes down.) One of the
cedar-getters had a dog with a great reputation
for dingo-killing; so I borrowed him for the
brindle, who was getting on my hqjves.
Jim Doolan lent him readily;"he was a big
nondescript brute, with an unearthly appetite.
“ This’s th’ way I ketches’m,” confided Jim to
me “Th’ol’ dorg runs’bout four chains ’ead ’o
me; then er dingo nips outer th’ scrub at ’im,
thinkin’ e’s lorst. Th’ ol’ dorg hollers ’n ketches
holt, ’n I run up wid a broken bullick bow in me
’and, the dingo watchin’ me all th’ time ’n not th’
dorg. Then Raowdy’s got ’is grip ’n we kill ’im
atween us. I sell th’ skelp fer fifteen bob t’ a’
Armidale cove, ’oo gits a paownd f’r it there. They
aint no baownty in this districk.”
I kept Rowdy for a few days, but the brindle
was too 'subtle; so, fearing a famine, I gave
him back again. About a week after Jim passed
in great distress.
“ That blasted brindle o’ yourn ’as killed
Raowdy,” he informed me. “ 01’ Raowdy wuz
playin’ th’ game ’bout a mile back, ’n Mister
Brindle jump outer th’ scrub ’n cops ’im be th’
throat afore ’p could yelp. I never heered no
noise, ’n’ w’en I come up there’s Brindle a-worryin’
the larst kick outer Raowdy. I wood’n’ a took
ten paown’ f’ that dorg. Y’ orter pay me f’ ’im, I
reckon, seein’ uz it wuz yore dingo as killed ’im.”
I left the scrub after that and came to Sydney,
owing the Ideal storekeeper'a. few pounds, which
I promised to pay him when convenient. He got
impatient in about a fortnight, and sooled a fierce
black collector-dingo on to me for payment.
This one wrote first in a pained way : “Would
you please settle the little account ? ” Treated this
with the contempt it deserved ; besides, I had no
spare money. Gpt another in a few days : “ Will
proceed against ypu if account not settled.” Wrote
to the storekeeper in a friendly tope, advising him
to. have nothing tq do with such offal. Got p
frantic yelp next (expect the hope of commission
was fading): “Will take proceedings imme-
diately.” Wrote again kindly to the creature,
advising him to take a box of Beeeham’s pills.
Reply came by return post (letter fairly smelt
of sulphur): “ Will issue summons for you.”
Replied through the week. Told him (still
kindly) that I was just fixing up my horses and
gear for a trip out to the Gulf with cattle, but if
he would meet me at the mouth of a certain gully
in these ranges, about dusk, I would settle up in
full with him. Silence ; dingo evidently winded.
Stills are barely paying now, and it’s hard to
earn an honest penny ; but a horse-planter told me
yesterday that scalps are worth £5 each in the
Burragorang valley, and £1 for pups.
Am going to look at a dingo slut fqr sale at
Bankstown to-morrow.

Piles cured
o>
c
OLD and Damp, Liver Disorder, and Consti-
pation—these are the causes of Piles. A chill
on the Liver obstructs the blood-circulation of
that organ, the veins of the lower. bowel
x r become congested, and Piles occur. Constipation has
precisely the same effect. When Bile Beans are taken
the congestion in the liver is removed, the organ proceeds with the secretion of bile, and
as this is the natural aperient of the body, Constipation is soon removed once the bile is
regulated. It is in this simple manner that Bile Beans cure Piles. Better than all local
applications—which only deal with the matter superficially—Bile Beans strike at the root
cause of the trouble. Hence their cures are permanent. As an illustration, take the
following case:—
“I am a butcher by trade,” says Mr. W. G. Holden, Kiama, N.S.W., “and my
occupation necessitates my being out in all weathers, and I have at times been forced
to ride in a wet saddle. The upshot of this was that I contracted Piles. I tried many
so-called remedies in the hope of getting rid of them, but with scant success, and I
continued suffering for ten or twelve years. About six months ago a friend advised me
to give Bile Beans a trial, and I promised to do so. although I had little hope of their
doing me any good after my past experiences. However, I was agreeably surprised
to find that the first few doses afforded me relief such as I had not experienced for
years, and, continuing the course, the Piles wbre permanently banished. I can confi-
dently recommend Bile Beans as an undoubted cure for Piles.”
BILE BEANS are a SAFE FAMILY MEDICINE and PROVED CURE for
BILIOUSNESS, HEADACHE, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES,
DEBILITY, FEMALE WEAKNESSES, NERVOUSNESS, BAD BLOOD, BAD
BREATH, ANEMIA, DISTURBED SLEEP, LOSS OF APPETITE, PIMPLES,
and ALL SKIN ERUPTIONS, RHEUMATISM, and by giving tone to the system
will ward off COUGHS, COLDS, and INFLUENZA. Obtainable generally at Is. l£d.,
or 2s. 9d. LARGE BOX (containing three times the Is. size).

A Song of Work.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE sing too much of sports and such — too
little of toil and deeds ;
Too much of love and stars above, and
winds in the whispering reeds.
Lot’s sing new songs of the toiling throngs—let’s
chant of hammer and saw ;
Let’s chant of life and steam and strife and the
foundry’s blazing maw !
Sing ho for Work—for the smoke-stack’s murk—
for the crash of iron and steel;
Huzza for the war where the pistons soar and
crank-shafts thrust and reel!
For the world’s great heart is beating here, ’midst
clamor of steel and steam ;
Man rules the earth with his strength and skill—
aye, man is a god supreme !
Aha for the crash where the forges flash, and the
anvils clank and clang;
Huzza for the beat of the iron feet where the
Nasmyths bounce and bang !
For the whirring drills and the roaring mills—for
the shafting’s rolling song—
Huzza for the gods and the piston-rods and the
workers stern and strong !
For I love the night where the Titans fight, and
the gloom is blotched with flame ;
Aye, I feel a king when the crossheads swing and
growl in their iron game ;
Fit kingdom this, where the forges hiss, and the
red slag drips like blood ;
O, I love grim Graft, and I love eaoh shaft, and I
love Work’s mighty thud 1
Let’s whine no more—let us smelt black ore—let’s
grapple at last with Fate;
Let’s march like men in the ranks again—let’s
tramp with a swinging gait !
Let us take our stand with the nations grand—let
us show that we’re not played out;
Let’s live, let’s act —let us deal with fact —have
done with drivel and doubt.
Have done with dreams and the misty themes—
have done with the dread of death ;
Let’s work like Hell for an age-long spell—let’s
laugh with our parting breath !
Nor prate nor preach, but rise and reach for the
nearest task at hand ;
bet’s toil, let’s sweat—let’s fight on yet for the
sake of our own dear land !
For we sing too much of sports and such — too little
of toil and deeds ;
Too much of lover and stars above, and winds in the
whispering reeds.
Lets sing new songs of the toiling throngs — let’s
chant of hammer and saw;
Aye, chant of life with its steam and strife and the
foundry's blazing maw 1
Sing ho for Work—for the smoke-stack’s murk—
for the crash of iron and steel;
Huzza for the war where the pistons roar and the
crankshafts thrust and reel I
Set the world's great heart a-beating here, midst
clamor of steel and steam ;
Let's shake the hills with ou/r iron wills—for Man is
a god supreme.

GRANT HERVER.
In the Cretin Country.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WENT to Varallo (in the Italian Alps),
by way of Stressa, to Orta over the Monte
Motterone, an unnecessary mountain of
5000 ft. high, and returned to Novara from Varallo
by railway. The sanctuary of Varallo is very
prodigal in the matter of chapels—there are 46
attached to the Church of the Sanctuary, which
has been a place of great resort by pilgrims since
good Bishop Borromeo visited it in 1584. But it
was certain, under any circumstances, to have
been popular with pilgrims, because Varallo is
1480 ft. above sea level, and the Sanctuary another
600 ft. above Varallo. It is a queer fact that pil-
grimages were never made to sanctuaries on a plain
and within comfortable travel of acity. Sanctuaries
were always built on the most difficult mountains
to be found.
At Varallo, again, I was struck by the greater
cleanliness of the Northern towns, and by the
absence of beggars. Notices prohibiting begging
are displayed at every street corner. But the
courtly Tuscan habit has disappeared, and the soft
voices and the luxurious climate and vegetation of
the South are re-placed by Swiss, German, and
Tyrolean harshness.
It was the day before Good Friday, and Varallo
had its usual Easter procession of the Crucifixion.
In Genoa Christ is represented in these proces-
sions by a man. In Varallo the prettiest youth
in the town had been selected as the Christ. His
hands and feet were painted to represent the
bleeding wounds of the stigmata—anticipating
the denouement, for he bore his cross, and the
procession represented the events immediately
following the scourging. His face was also bloody
and his brows were crowned with thorns.
His disciples followed, represented by grades of
youthful handsomeness, according to the rank
tradition assigns them in the Church. Lastly
Judas, a horror of a man ; a dwarf with a matted
beard and yellow teeth, and a goitre to his breast-
bone. The representation was repulsive to the
verge of beastliness.
» * * •
I left early next morning for the “mines.” The
road ascended steeply for all the distance. I
climbed seven miles of wall, which greatly taxed
the strength that was just returning to me after
three months’ illness. The road is peppered with
well-painted shrines. A favorite subject is St.
Peter with his foot upon a stuffed lion.
Although the day was Good Friday, the steep
cobbled mountain paths were dotted with peasant
girls carrying, in the great baskets that extended
from above their heads to below their hips, bushes,
manure, firewood or wine barrels. They were
newly-washed girls, too, and in festa dress—a
chemisette and a zouave jacket, short skirt and
grey stockings, and boots of undressed leather—
but they worked all the same.
All the time I was in Valsesia, I saw no other
beasts of burden in the country. Centuries of
labor-had greatly uglified all types. Only once
did we meet a pretty girl, and the Corporale’s one ’
eye wandered and revolved as he looked at her.
She was in the company of a woman laden with
half a cart-load of hay, who was the official
portatrice of the Commune. When we resumed
our climb the one-eyed shift-boss said, “Bella
ragazza ! Tutto sangue e busto ” (a beautiful girl
—■all blood and bosom).
A cold wind blew off the snow and down the
gorge we struggled to ascend, and necessitated an
overcoat, so that, between the half-freezing of the
wind and the perspiration induced by weakness
and exercise, over an hour passed before we
stood at the neck of the gorge.
And then for a moment, it was worth the
struggle. Ahead was a snowy little tableland
chequered by peach-trees in full bloom. Immedi-
ately behind them, the background of the snow-
covered mountain threw back the color of the
peach-bloom and exaggerated its depth by the
reflection.
It was necessary to climb this mountain at its
most precipitous point. Arrived at the summit,
I looked over into Switzerland, but drew back
again quickly, for fear the Swiss should see me and
puckalow me.
Now that you are locked in by the mountains,
tread lightly, for you are on unholy ground. This
is the home of the deadly jodeller, and the land
of the poisonous “ tira lira,” and of the father of
all such as say or sing “ Lu-lu-liety,” or cry
“Milk-ho !” with variations.
The general air of unintelligence in the sodden
faces of the people we passed at these heights
was very striking. Stupid cretins carrying horse
burdens ; pigmy and misshapen men, wry in the
face and twisted in the limbs; men with long,
curling chins, splay lips, and shaking mouths,
yellow-tusked and matted of beard, came down
these little paths and muttered to themselves as
they walked. There were also very undersized
women with Chinese beards, who bore their horse-
burdens through the leafless chestnut groves and
gibbered to themselves ; horrible old beldames
who sprayed themselves with rheum as they
talked ; and many half-naked, beastly, and goi-
trous dwarfs.
This is the chamber of horrors of rural Europe,
without a doubt. Some constituent in the water
is alleged to be responsible for this idiot asylum,
but there must be other very serious contributing
causes.
My idea of the origin of these people of the
Upper Valsesia is this : Two lunatics—-one male
and one female—escaped from their asylum, and
she said : “ Where shall we go ? ”
Replied the man : “We must getaway from
these madmen who put us in that asylum. They
live on the plains, so let us go to the mountains.”
“ I love the mountains,” said the lady lunatic.
So they went there and multiplied exceedingly,
and all the people who live in mountains are mad,
even unto this day.
The festa dresses. of these girls of Valsesia d©
not vary much in form in the many communes.
The bodices are usually well-fitting—the skirts
generally appear to have been cut out by a drunken
tailor with a squaring axe. Thus the effect is
always to make them hulky-waisted—and in some
cases the waist is carried so high that it is a sur-
vival of the Directory period, and in others it is
so' bulky in addition t© its height as to be more
than a suggestion of the dresses of the “ Bals a la
Victirne” after the fall of Robespierre—every
fashionable citizeness pretending to be in an
interesting condition, “by means of mere pillows
and stuffing,” says Montgaillard.
The “mine” was not a mine, but merely a
gratuitous hole in the earth, as usual, so I left the
snow, and the goitrous cretins, and the bearded
ladies who gibbered under the chestnuts, and the
railway took me to Novara and thence to Milan.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Moving of De Jersey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOON after we were married we went to
live in a row of dove-cots in Jay-street, North
Sydney. Ours was No. 9—“ The Nest.”
No. 11 was ‘ 1 The Nook.” I made the acquaintance
of “The Nook” by borrowing his saw. Their
name was De Jersey—superior people, but affable.
They lived in Jay-street because of. the lovely view
across the vacant land opposite. “The Nook” is
small, of course, and only 18s. 6d., “butsreally,
you know, the aspect is delightful.” We had
barely settled down in “ The Nest ” when a jerry-
builder started to run up a row of pigeon-boxes
opposite, and ran them up with amazing rapidity.
The gentility of the dove-cots was seriously threat-
ened while the view from their windows was wiped
out. Emphatic was the wrath of De Jersey, and
his scorn was withering.
“ What decent people,” he demanded from the
verandah to the unheeding jerry-builder, “can
live here with those places there ? Look at them !
Cribs ! Just cribs ! Look at that hall, made out
©f a packing-case; and the rooms the size of a
mousetrap! Where are the Health Department
people ? Can’t someone stop the man ? Who is
he building them for ? Does he know any pigmies
to let them to ? Where’s our beautiful view ?
Aren’t people’s rights to be respected ? Well,
one thing’s flat. Out we go, pretty quick ! ”
One day my wife- ran out to meet me just as
the houses opposite were being finished. “ Jim,
dear ; I’ve been over the Houses opposite. They
are really not half bad. Such quaint little corner
fireplaces with the sweetest mantelpieces. And
such a cunning glassed-in verandah at the back.
It’s an extra room, really; and they have more
land than these. .And, Jim, dear, the rooms are
not really much smaller. And only 135., Jim.
And, dear, Mr. Dodson has built another row at
Crow’s Nest. Just the same, and he says he will
let us have one for 12s. 6d. on a lease. Crow’s
Nest is not really such a very poor neighborhood,
after all, and you know it is nearer the boat than
we are here.”
She finally played on my feelings with th#
saving of 6s. a week. “But what will I say to
De Jersey ?He will be just horrified.” I weakly
remonstrated. The thought of telling that scion
of an ancient stock that I was going to live in a
13s. house owned by that worm, the jerry-builder,
was grievous.
“ Oh, tell him we can’t stand the houses opposite;
and, besides, we want to live in Mosman to be
near mother.”
I’m a poor liar, but De Jersey didn’t cross-
examine me. He was full of his own plans.
“ I’ve bought a place at Killara,” he said.
“ Killara’s rather far up, and, of course, expen-
sive ; but the people are decent, and there are the
golf links. And besides” (glaring at the offend-
ing Dobson, busily fixing “ Murielville ”on the
gable of No. 24 opposite) “ you can’t be out
there.”
They moved first, and my wife and I waved a
long farewell as their pantechnicon toiled up the
hill. It came for us a week later. Getting into
Rawson Villa was a squeeze. After a vain,
glorious struggle with a curtain pole, I was again
forced into making the acquaintance of next door
by asking him for a loan of his saw. Climbing on
the fence, I discovered Northcote Villa painfully-
beating a carpet spread over a clothes-line. A
towel was wrapped round his head.
“ Could you very kindly oblige ”
I stopped, for under the towel I had recognised
De Jersey.

“I was a strong,

began to heal, and my general health improved. I followed up the treatment,
until now lam as strong and robust as ever. I cannot too strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-puritier and tonic.”
You will notice it was “ Ayer’s ” Sarsaparilla tbat made this splendid cure
for Mrs. Snook. There ai’b mhny other Sarsaparillas on the market, but
there is only one “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. It is the old, original, genuine
Sarsaparilla. The Sarsaparilla tbat has been tested and tried for over sixty
years. Do not run the risk of trying some other kind.

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day.
The lowing herds wind slowly o’er the hills ?
The workman homeward p ods his weary way,
To find at home relief in OEEC JAM’S PILLS.
But it is not only when the day’s work is done that so many
feel weary ; some amongst us feel tired and “ done up ” before
the day has scarcely begun—in fact, we get up weary and
depressed. Everything is a trouble, work is irksome, and life
seems hardly worth the living. To these
teeeham’s
Pills
are invaluable. They promote digestion, improve the appetite,
cleanse the stomach, arouse the sluggish liver, purify the blood,
and generally tone up the system so that the depressed feeling
is banished and we live and move in perfect health.
BEECHAM’S PILLS
have stood the test of the most exacting experience through
many years; they continue to enhance their reputation for
maintaining good health and perfect condition.
