MALTHOID is known as the highest-grade roofing, both from
a scientific and practical point of view. The basis of Malthoid
is a pure mineral that was used in connection with roofing the
old Spanish Mission Stations in Southern California, and has
withstood the elements for centuries. Malthoid is absolutely
waterproof under every possible condition, and is free from the
thousand and one troubles that beset tiles, slates, shingles and
iron.

Embosomed in the central sea there lies,
Beyond the faintest limits of the land,
where dwelt the maid of Atlas, him
M/io set against unconquerable Zeus
His Titan strength, and learned too late
that ill
Befalls the man who tears against the gods.
Looks like poetry, doesn’t it? Blank
verse, capital letters, classical allusions—all
the paraphernalia that gives the old illu-
sion, all the indirect ways of saying things
in a paraphrase that could be said in one
word—and not one idea, one original phrase,
one hint of beauty behind it, one suggestion
or the bard who sings because he must. “The
Maid of Atlas,” i.e., Calypso—look up Atlas
in the classical dictionary for further infor-
mation. And so John Bernard O’Hara
rambles on, with all the old properties taken
trom the dead poets’ dusty shelves and fur-
bished up for John Bernard O’Hara’s use.
Azure mist, girlhood’s pride, the lonely
mariner, storm-tost, on honeyed wings, the
bright starry throng, fields Elysian, golden
orijtammes, the dreamless dead, smoke-
shrouded cities, fever heat, fateful odds,
the ichor of springtime, the olden miracle of
spring, love’s resurrection, the stainless
ether, the passionless hills, Love’s golden
avatar, a deathless rime, the foaming seas,
deep, unfathomed woods, Pierian days, Nat-
ures loving arms, folded to her breast, the
brine (t.e., the ocean), etc.
From such echoes John Bernard O’Hara
constructs his harmless verse. Uncon-
sciously, probably, he has plundered the
classics, or the pseudo-classics, and from these
stock phrases he has concocted, with some cul-
inary cleverness, his clear soup. He carefully
refrains from the intrusion of any ideas, ex-
cept those standardised in poetical expression.
And the alleged poet of few ideas, and with
the technical ability to conceal his vacuous-
ness, is infinitely more dangerous than the
poet with something individual to say but
without the skill to say it. The latter has
only to learn the grammar of his art; the
former will continue to deceive his readers
vnth the assumption that poetry is nothing
but technical adroitness. Hence this analy-
sis of a writer who, as poet, is graceful and
inane, whose green-covered, spacious book
of verse looks like the real thing, and will
SSKSt* t ? e t( dr awing-room of any suburban
aspirant to culture. But, in order to give
John Bernard O’Hara the benefit of the
doubt, let us quote the only two pieces in
this volume of poems” that give him some
excuse for writing at all. They represent
p r» SC j ant gleanings of the haggard harvest
ot o alypso aud Other Poems.
ROMANGE AND PORGY.
Romance and her pale lover poesy
Charm us no more. The wonder paths
that led
To gates of dream are gone, the days are
dead
That heard the pipes of Pan sound joyously.
Mo longer nymphs of river and of tree
Haunt the clear streams or piney moun-
tain-head;
Demeter from the old green earth has fled ,
loseidon rules no more the purple sea.
Old myths are dead. From mountain wood
and stream
Where Musagetes sat upon his throne
a I J ie , 2T ee " divinities afar have flown.
And left the lands to silence. All things
SC6TYI
Sterile and songless, cold and loveless
grown,
As the wotid hardens round the poet's
dream. 1
If Thou Should’st Be No More.
If thou should’st be no more, and pallid
sleep,
Discrowned of-dreams, sit by thy quiet
head,
And set upon thy loveless lips the deep,
Dumb silences that clothe the naked dead
With perfect peace, and all forgetfulness
Of life’s unending stress.
Nature would change not. As of old her
dawns
Would dance through their wild rosary
afar;
Her pale moon-maidens pace their lilied
lawns,
Plucking the fading blossoms of each star;
And wind and wave uplift, while life
should be
The music of the sea.
Nay, she’d rejoice. Her universal soul,
Swift interfused with thine, would feel the
thrill
Of added beauty; hear new echoes roll
In refluent waves of music: know thee
still
In fruit and flower, in song and leaf and
tree,
And earth's wild wizardry.
But I would hold thee only in the thrall
Of fevered dreams and visions of the night,
Never again to hear the sweet voice call,
Never again to see the sweet love-light
Rain from thine eyes and flood my spifit
o’er —,
If thou should’st be no more.
And, in conclusion, it may be as well to
mention that there are 'Ji3 worse poets
in Australia than John Bernard O’Hara.
The Centre of Australia
It is exactly 50 years since McDouall
Stuart first crossed Australia. Could he
now revisit the scene of his explorations he
would find the Central country, save for the
telegraph line, with its isolated stations,
practically unchanged. He might, at long
intervals, come across a hut forming the
home of one or two white men managing an
outlying cattle-run. In the heart of the
Macdonnell Ilanges he would find a minute
township called after himself, and away to
the east of the track, he would hear of the
existence of a mere handful of miners, the
relics of a gold rush, on the Arltunga field.
Otherwise he would find the vast centre of
the continent as wild and empty as it was
when first he toiled across.
In these words Baldwin Spencer and F.
J. Gillen introduce their important work,
Across Australia (Macmillan 2 vols. 215.).
This work differs from the authors’ previous
publications, The Native Tribes of Central
Australia, The Northern Tribes of Central
Australia, and the Horn Scientific Expedi-
tion to Central Australia, which were prac-
tically technical works. Across Australia
is meant for the general reader, a simple
narrative of things seen, but of things that no
white man has seen before or is likely to see,
for both members have had special facilities
for investigation into the sacred customs
and beliefs of the aborigines—beliefs and
customs that are fast dying out. The nar-
rative is of absorbing interest; the numerous
illustrations alone convey a clear picture of
the heart of our continent.
In winter... .the climate of the Centre is
perfect. The days are warm and the nights
cold Often it was so cold that we awoke
to find our water bags frozen solid; but the
a.ir was so dry that we felt the cold but
little... .From a climatic point of view it
would be difficult to find anything more brac-
ing and invigorating than the winter months
in Central Australia.
In speaking of the sacred ceremonies of
the natives, of which a series of remarkable
photographs are given, the authors call
attention to the fact that these gatherings,
necessitating the sustenance of compara-
tively large bodies of men, can only be held
in places where water and .food are abund-
ant.
The Macdonnell Ranges are well adapted
for the purpose. Water, if it be a good sea-
son, is abundant, and so are plants and
animals. The supply of grass seed, which is
perhaps the most valuable single food, is
practically inexhaustible; bulbs and seeds
are easily obtained, and in many places the
succulent Claytonia, a kind of pig-face,
grows luxuriantly. On the broad plains
amongst the ranges large kangaroos and
emus can be caught, and smaller wallabies
amongst the rocks.
The strangest feature of the centre is the
group of mountains that are included in the
title of the Macdonnell Ranges, which form
the highest elevation of what the authors
term “the higher steppes.”
Approaching from the south it is quite a
welcome change, after traversing the dreary
country of the Lower Steppes, to see ahead
a range of rugged, dark-red rocks, the
southernmost ridges of the more ancient for-
mations which constitute the backbone, as
it were, of Central Australia, running for
perhaps 300 or 400 miles east and west
across the country.
The Macdonnell Ranges rise into peaks
nearly 5000 ft. in height. The mountain
ranges run east and west, but the river
courses run right across them from north
to south, actually taking their rise from low
hills to the north of the main range, and
cutting picturesque gorges through these
bleak and monolithic-looking rocky ranges.
The explanation of this peculiar arrange-
ment is that the rivers were there fjrst, and
that, when the ranges were elevated, the
rivers had no choice but to cut their way
through the new obstacles in their pre-
determined direction of flow.
Central Australia, in the author’s pessi-
mistic opinion, is but the ruins of a luxuri-
ant land, a land of flowing streams and
dense forests. The size of the watercourses
and the gorges they have hollowed out in
the centre tableland are out of all propor-
tion to the present flow of water, and “seem
to afford the clearest possible evidence that
continuous desiccation has been the leading
feature in the recent history of Central
Australia.”
. the desiccation of the Central area con-
tinues, the time will come when even the
present small flow of water will become
less. For a time, perhaps, there will be a
few pools which, for a little while, after the
rain season, will be filled with water, but
the present slight flow, even during the
cooler months, will cease, just as it had
already done at Ayers Rock and Mount
Olga.
In such a strange land there were strange
inhabitants. The naturalists mention the
water-holding frog, the crab of the desert,
the honey ant, and the barking spider. The
water-holding frog tides over a dry season
of 18 months or so by filling itself so full of
water that it looks rather like George Reid,
burrowing a foot below the surface and
going to sleep, able to exist upon its private
water-supply. The specimens found were
in ground that was so hard that it had to
be cut with a hatchet. The water squeezed
from the frog was quite pure and fresh ; and
the natives find this species of animal well
useful. The crab of the desert is a true
crab, existing in waterholes, and its pre-
sence in the centre of the continent points
back to a time when there was a great in-
land sea.
The crab has evidently been left behind
and has adapted itself, not only to fresh-
water lile, but to conditions which would, at
nrst sight, appear to be almost fatal to crab
life. It makes a burrow in the bank of a
creek m which it can retain water sufficient
to keep itself moist and to tide over months
of drought.
The honey ant, also found in the arid
parts of Mexico and Colorado, stores the
communal honey in the enormously dis-
tended body of one of its members. The
chosen insect is fed on honey until its crop,
in which the honey is stored, becomes so
enormously, distended that the rest of the
ant looks like a mere appendage to a small
golf ball. When the other ants want honey
they are said to tap on the sides of the
honey jar, and the jar passes out the honey
from its mouth. The barking spider make's
a whistling noise by rubbing its spiny man-
dibles across rows of keys on its palps. The
authors do not say why it barks —whether
from mere ennui or at the moon: this knotty
subject is hereby handed over to the “Abo-
ralians.”
«**
The special interest of the authors’ in-
vestigations into the habits of the Central
tribes lies in the fact that these natives
are authentic inhabitants of the Stone Age:
We naturally know nothing very definite
about the ancient Stone Age people in other
parts of tl}e world, except that they used
stone implements. Everything else has van-
ished, but we shall probably not be far
trom right in picturing them as leading very
much the same sort of life as the Australian
savage does at the present day. Like the
latter, they presumably had their camps,
smiting about from place to place in search
of food, and spending much of their spare
time in performing ceremonies which were,
probably, closely similar to those that the
Australian Stone Age men now perform.
Australia, in fact, isolated as it has been
for long ages past, has preserved for us a
more or less unchanged remnant of primi-
tive mankind, exactly as it has done in the
case of many of the lower animals. If it
were not for Australia we should know no-
thing of the lowest form of mammals, save
their fossil bones; and so, in just the same
way, we should know nothing, or next to
nothing, of the manner of life of the most
primitive communities of human beings.
A word for the native woman:—
Like all savages, the woman of the Arunta
tribe grows old at a very early age. By the
time she is 30 sffie is completely passee. and
at 40 is a veritable hag. There are probably
few who live beyond the age of 50. The
younger women walk with remarkable grace,
due partly to the fact that they are not
impeded by a close-fitting dress, and partly
also to the fact that they are accustomed to
carry a wooden bowl containing food and
water on their heads. One day, at Alice
Springs, we saw a native woman walking
along quite comfortably, with a big bowl of
grass seed balanced on her head; her left
arm was around a child, sitting straddle-
legged across her hip, and under her right
she held a second bowl of seed. Wondering
what she would do, we threw her half a
stick of tobacco. It fell to the and,
without a moment’s hesitation, she picked
it up with her right foot, using her great toe
as we should do our thumb, transferred
it to her right hand, and went on with a
smile. After you have become accustomed to
the graceful carriage of a savage woman, the
walk of the ordinary white woman seems
like an awkward waddle.

New Australia
William Lane’s “New Australia” an
Cosme communal colonies, in Paraguay ai
now ancient history; but that weary ol
gent., “Anti-Sosh,” has seized upon the ex
pertinent as a shocking example of wlia
►socialism in our time would be. Whcr
{socialism has Failed, by Stewart Graham
(Murray), will bring comfort to many
despondent white waistcoat. ' There are
however, two objections to Grahame’s em
battered criticism: (1) His definition o
Socialism is utterly out of date: he sets u
a terrible bogey of Anti-Christ and fre
love, and proceeds to demolish it with shriek
of glee, apparently unaware that State So
cialism is in full blast at the present tim
in Australia. (2) Lane’s experiment was no
Socialism at all. For nearly the first tw
years, under the articles of association, New
Australia was a benevolent despotism, a
Lane, by means of his control of proxies, hac
absolute power; and both before and afte
his expulsion the life was communal, am
not Socialistic. Grahame’s very apparen
bias robs an interesting book of much of it
historical value. He prints, for instance,
photograph of happy children, with the cap
tion: “Under Socialism the barefooted chil
dren ran terrible risks from venomous
snakes,” as if Socialism always presume*,
snakes.- And the letterpress reeks with un
charitableness. One page is headed “Free
Love,” though Lane insisted on a binding
marriage ceremony, and took stern steps to
preserve decorum on board the ship that car-
ried this hopeful, foolish band of idealists to
their promised land. And the author’s con-
ception of State Socialism is made plain bj
his statement: “It rarely occurs to the rank
and file that the step to State Socialism, once
made, would be irrevocable, even if it shoulf
lead to absolute ruin.” And every year, in
every progressive State in the world, steps
to State Socialism ard being made. One of
the first was State management of the Post
Office; the latest is State endowment of
motherhood. Socialism is not a new Utopia
into which a nation will step one fine morn-
ing : it is a common-sense synthesis of civil-
isation which is happening every day, and
with each year it occupies a larger area of
the life of the community.
The New Australia experiment was a
rash one. The party, having thrown all
they possessed into a common fund, found
themselves, at the outset, in a strange coun-
try, up agains't unforeseen .difficulties. At
first the community was as primitive as that
of our own Australian pioneers. But the
communal life was the greatest obstacle to
progress. Where none benefited by his own
work, that work was slackly done. The
result was failure. The communal idea, at
this stage of the history of the world, will
not work. Expulsions and wholesale deser-
tions decimated the communists’ ranks. Life
in New Australia was a piggery, complicated
with incessant law-making and quarrels.
The Paraguayan Government, recognising
the value of these white colonists, again and
again helped them in their struggle to sur-
vive. Lane had to bow to the will of his
people and resign. He hived off with his
immediate followers to Cosme, where the
experiment was started again. The New
Australians admitted the Paraguayan natives
into their community. The Cosme colony
failed, and William Lane was superseded. He
returned to Sydney, to edit the Sydney
Worker, and forwarded over £2OO to the
remnant left in Paraguay. His brother,
John, was elected leader; and here the
Cosme colony broke away from their prin-
ciples, held to with such determination and
for so long; and the communists became
exploiters of cheap and colored labor. And
in New Australia the communal experiment
was finally abandoned. The land was
divided up into-farms, and once more each
worked for himself and not for his brother
man. Cosme followed. At the present day
the prosperity of those who remain at New
Australia is steadily increasing, and if the
new Trans-Paraguayan railway touches it,
there will be a boom.
The ineradicable bias intrudes itself even in
the attempt to prove, frbm a few cases of sui-
cide, or attempted suicide, that there is “a
tendency for suicide to associate itself with
Socialism.” Suicide and free love and
venomous snakes! Better not be Socialists.
There remains a feeling of sympathy in
the mind of the reader with these simple,
muddle-headed heroes, who left the one
country that was to achieve the greatest
measure of Socialism, and will achieve more,
to found, in a strange environment, a com-
munal paradise—these high-minded men who
relapsed into the crude communalism of the
earth’s earlier ages.' instead of staying to
help on the scientific State Socialism that
is the next step in the progress of the race.

ANTHONY HORDERNS’ for EVERYTHING
Anthony Horderns’
For RAZORS.
The MODERN SAFETY RAZOR is a LUXURY ;
it SIMPLIFIES SHAVING, makes it SO EASY
that the NOVICE is INDEPENDENT of the
BARBER, and, with the GEM JUNIOR, as well
as several OTHER STYLES OF SAFETY
RAZORS, there is a NEW BLADE for EACH
DAY of the week. In the LIST that follows we
quote a SELECTION, and offer them at
ANTHONY HORDERNS’
FAMOUS ROW PRICES.
GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR solves the
problem for the man who cannot rely upon the
old-style Razor. It is unequalled for easy and
luxurious Shaving, and does not scrape nor pull.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR, with the
New Bar, adds still further to the EFFICIENCY
of this popular Safety Razor. THE GEM
JUNIOR, provides a KEEN BLADE for EVERY
day in the week. Every Blade automatically ad-
justs itself, and as the BLADE does the shaving
it is the first consideration.
GEM JUNIOR BLADES are made from the
best Razor Steel, tempered by a process, patented
by the Gem Cutlery Co. (the oldest makers of
Safety Razors), that provides a keen, lasting
edge.
After using GEM JUNIOR BLADES several
times they may be stropped—the steel is superior,
the temper and edge so fine, that stropping
makes them as good as ever.
The New Bar smoothes out the creases of the
skin, raises the beard just ahead of the cutting
edge, and makes perfect shaving a simple matter.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR is made
and finished in the BEST STYLE, of the BEST
materials, and by the best workmanship. It
comprises Nickel-plated Frame, extra handle for
Stropping Blades, and Seven KEEN-EDGED
BLADES, packed in neat case.

GILLETTE SAFETY RAZOR
The advantage of the GILLETTE SAFETY
RAZOR is the ease and rapidity with which shav-
ing is accomplished.
The GILLETTE SAFETY RAZOR not only
makes shaving easy, but it ensures a clean, close
shave, no matter how tough the beard may be or
how tender the skin.
The simple means of adjusting the curve of the
blades is a GILLETTE feature, and assures the
proper angle for shaving. There is no difficulty,
no elaborate preparations, and no stropping.

DURHAM DUPLEX SAFETY RAZOR.
The DURHAM DUPLEX embraces the best
points of the old-style Razor, and the advantages
of the safety guard and interchangeable Blades.
, The DURHAM DUPLEX RAZOR affords the
correct SLIDING DIAGONAL STROKE, together
with a SAFETY-GUARD and INTERCHANGE-
ABLE BLADES, and, therefore, enables you to

ANTHONY HORDERNS’
for the Renowned
White Sewing Machine.
The CAREFUL attention given to what SOME
manufacturers consider as TRIFLES has led to
the I'IIENOMENAL success of the LIGHT-RUN-
NING, Silent
WHITE SEWING MACHINE.
There is NO BETTER FAMILY SEWING
MACHINE constructed than the WORLD-RE-
NOWNED WHITE, which POSSESSES EVERY
feature that stands for SEWING MACHINE
EFFICIENCY, such as BALL Bearings, a
DIRECT TENSION and Tension RELEASER,
which ACTS LIKE A CHARM, adjusting itself
AUTOMATICALLY to ANY size thread, RELEAS-
ING the tension IMMEDIATELY the presser-foot
is raised.
The WHITE has a SELF-THREADING
SHUTTLE, and the WHITE TENSION INDI-
CATOR, absolutely the FINEST of its kind, is
INSTANTANEOUS in action, the dial pointer
showing the EXACT tension.
EXCLUSIVELY a WHITE feature is the unique
DROP HEAD and AUTOMATIC LIFT, which
works with CERTAIN satisfaction, causes users
NO TROUBLE, and is SIMPLY and EASILY
DID YOU EVER stop to think of the wear and
tear of the average sewing machine shuttle, due
to the use of a loose bobbin often found in some
machines? The WHITE Shuttle has a spool-pin
in the centre, firmly fixed at one end, and the
bobbin revolving on this works evenly, smoothly.
It cannot GOUGE the Shuttle, and the thread
comes off regularly without a hitch. You can
drop either end of bobbin in shuttle.
We INVITE you to INVESTIGATE the many
POINTS of EXCELLENCE in the WHITE SEW-
ING MACHINE, note the BEAUTY of the WHITE
construction, and the fine MECHANICAL adjust-
ment, examine the INCOMPARABLE LABOR-
SAVING devices and the SERVICEABLE set of
KING STEEL ATTACHMENTS, which are heavily
nickel-plated, and observe the IMPROVEMENTS
which allow an UNFINISHED piece of work to
be REMOVED from the machine and REPLACED
in the same position at some future time. .
An IMPORTANT FEATURE that affects SEW-
ING MACHINE BUYERS is the ENORMOUS
saving that is brought about by

Condemned to be life-long
Invalid.
Restored to Health by
“ Wincarnis.”
Mrs. SARAH DE VILLE, Burton-
on-Trent, writes: —
Dear Sirs, —A few months ago
I was so dangerously ill that the
doctors said they could do nothing
more for me, and advised me to
make the best I could of life, as I
should never be well again. I was
terribly upset at the prospect of
being a life-long invalid, and when
a friend of mine urged me to try
“Wincarnis,” I applied to you for
one of your free trial bottles. I was
astonished and delighted to find that
from the first glassful your “Win-
carnis” put new life into me. I perse-
vered with “Wincarnis,” and before
long I was able to get about again.
Instead of remaining a life-long in-
valid, I was now able to carry on
business, and I owe all my renewed
health and strength entirely to your
wonderful “Wincarnis.”
Yours very gratefully,
SARAH DE VILLE.
So weak, could hardly walk.
“ Wincarnis ” gave new life.
52 Nightingale Road, Dover.
Dear Sirs,—l feel in duty bound
to write and thank you for the won-
derful benefit I have derived from
your splendid “Wincarnis.” For
months I have been depressed and
nervous, and so weak that I could
hardly walk, and felt I wanted to
be always sitting or lying down.
But your “Wincarnis” has put New
Life into me. I can now go about
my work with a new vigor, that
makes my household duties a pleas-
ure, instead of a burden as before.
I cannot properly express my grati-
tude for the grand health your life-
giving “Wincarnis” has given me.
It is splendid to feel so strong and
well. I have told all my neighbors
about your wonderful “Wincarnis,”
and I feel I want to tell the whole
world what a splendid tonic and re-
storative it is.
Yours very gratefully,
(Mrs.) C. B. BARNATT.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Jewel-Block”: The underwriters of the King
Arthur—recently sunk off the Brazilian coast —have
just fallen-in after the same old fashion. They sold
the big steamer for about 2J per cent, of the £42,000
insurance paid on it, and now it has been floated
and brought into Bahia, little the worse for its
sojourn amongst the fishes. Wreck-speculators always
throw every possible difficulty in the way of salvag-
ing by owners or insurers, in the endeavor to collar
a soft thing in bargains. In some cases, however,
the thing has been so much “over the odds” that the
underwriters have kicked, and there are not a few
wrecks scattered about the world which, though now
absolutely worthless, are still the property of under-
writers who wouldn’t let themselves be bluffed into
selling for a mere trifle. Now they talk about
making it a hard and fast rule never, in any cir-
cumstances, to sell a wreck.
“Lud”: Helen Gladstone, daughter of the illustri-
ous statesman, has just published a scathing letter
on church bazaars. There is a fashionable gang of
professional bazaar-mongers—Society folk who make
a good deal of money. Cases are mentioned of the
profits being about £lOOO, but only £2OO or £3OO
has reached the Holy Cause. The accounts are sel-
dom if ever audited. Stall-keepers can return what
they like. Shady shopkeepers are leagued with the
mongers to work off surplus stocks.
They have been celebrating the centenary of gas-
light in London. It is interesting to recall the argu-
ments advanced against the new illuminant. One hun-
dred years or more ago the clergy denounced it as
“profanity,” as “contrary to the laws of God,” and as
“endeavoring to turn night into day in opposition
to the Divine order.” The lamplighters and the men
engaged in the whale fisheries opposed gaslight as
“certain to destroy their means of livelihood.” The
nobility did not want it because the brightness would
bring vulgar crowds close to their mansions at nigh:
and they actually succeeded in keeping the gas out
of exclusive and aristocratic Grosvenor Square until
the year 1842. Manual laborers petitioned against
gas because it would lessen the demand for their
services ; and, strangely enough, even eminent authors
like Sir Whiter Scott, and distinguished scientists
like Sir Humphrey Davy, did their best to prevent
the substitution of gas for the old-fashioned oil and
candles.
* * * *
Barr, the chairman of the Licenses Reduction
Board, which groans under the weight of good things
provided in the way of pub-adjudication cases, has
directed attention to another pitfall in the path of
the guileless licensee. “Country people,” he said,
“go to Melbourne, and pay big ingoings for hotels!
and are the laughing-stock of the city. Eventually
they are dumped out on the footpath without six-
pence in their pockets.” Barr might have gone further,
and told how the ex-country licensee contributes to
his own undoing. Bill Jinks, of the Rabbiters’ Arms,
at Ants’ Nest, allured by the specious representa-
tions of what the trade knows as “pocketbook
brokers,” is induced to buy a worthless city hotel.
He christens it afresh, puts a few pot-plants in the
corridor, and expects it to rival Menzies. Perhaps it
might have a chance were it not that the bulloekies
and rabbiters, who knew Bill at Ants’ Nest, reckon
that Bill would feel ’urt-like if they didn’t give ’im
a look in when they are in town. And they look in
whenever they come to town, and induce their rela-
tives to do likewise. This may benefit the bar trade,
but the bushies and backblockers do not enhance the
new-laid reputation of the place as a residential
hotel—a reputation which Bill, with the example of
Cliveden Mansions as his Mecca, is anxious to sustain
and foster. Even the hope of maintaining an ex-
clusive sixpenny bar begins to resemble a ragged
purple dream with beer-stains on it; and by-and-bye,
as Barr pointed out, the licensee, Bill aforesaid,
finds himself in the street with the sixpence herein-
before mentioned. And a single sixpence in Mel-
bourne nowadays is as little company for a man as
a flapper is to an archbishop’s grandfather.
* * * *
“G.” : Talking about food rings, and Chapman and
Alexander, and other highly profitable features of
modern Christianity, reminds me of a story of a
pious founder of one of Ma State’s most er —exclusive
families. In the old Sydney days, when supplies
occasionally ran low, prices of commodities occasion-
ally ran high, and a man who had a “corner” gener-
ally gave them a flying start. One Sunday, in a
droughty year, when the flour supply was very short,
the pious founder was in church in communion with
Providence (from whom all blessings flow), when a
confidential clerk tiptoed up to him with the glad
tidings that one of his overdue ships was in sight.
Now, the vessel had aboard a big consignment of
flour, which, if landed, would sadly interfere with
the pious trader’s plans and profits. So, in between
the amens, he whispered, “Signal her to keep off
for three days.” This was done, and the sancti-
monious forebear of local nobility unloaded his ware-
house holdings at the high market price then ruling.
Thus was the Profit worshipped and the Prophet
appeased.
* * * *
“Quidam”: The best trade trick I ever discovered
was played frequently by an old Irish publican on
the inhabitants of his decayed town. When the Sat-
urday nighters were drifting along to the rival drink-
ery in unduly large quantities, he would stroll out
on the footpath and start to laugh uproariously,
every now and then stopping to gasp out such re-
marks as, “Well, that’s the best thing I iver heard!”
“Bedad, that’s good ! I wouldn’t have missed that
for wurrulds!” “Did ye iver hear the loikes o’ that,
now!” Before long some one would notice the
hysterical merriment, remark to his group, “What’s
the fun over at old John’s?” and lead the way
across. A congregation would soon gather round,
and be conducted inside to hear “th’ funniest yarn
ye iver heard in all your life!” The old man always
had a good yarn ready, and the teller was always
a commercial who had retired to bed. Heaven only
knows what that publican mightn’t have done if he
had gone into literature. Where he got his stories
from I don’t know, but if he invented them he was
an inventor of no small tonnage.
HOW IT IS DONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne AKgUs has discovered that the men
employed hy the Federal authorities to put down
the telephone wires in and about Melbourne toil
not, neither do they spin. It is an old story. The
workers never really do anything, and when anything
actually gets done it is something in the nature of
an act of God.
They say the plumber never plumbs,
The tinker doesn’t tink at all,
The carpenter his contract slums,
The navvy leans upon a wall,
The laborer sits all day long,
And smokes a short, discolored clay )
But business still is going strong,
And smart, commercial people throng
To gather through the livelong day
The fees that industry must pay.
The bricky doesn’t lay his bricks,
The joiners join their task to shirk,
While plasterers are skilled in tricks
To dodge the penalty of work ;
But see the lordly residence
That’s being built for Uncle Fat,
With marble front and rooms immense,
It lifts and spreads before the sense.
If no one’s talking through his hat,
Say, how may we account for that?
The navvy doesn’t dig his trench,
But dances breakdowns on the job,
While in the house the kitchen wench
Is dozing ever on the hob ;
But see the loaded steamers pass,
Our daily bread arrives all right,
And millionaires their piles amass.
The fact is that the Leisured Class
In secret rises in its might,
And does the world’s work in the night.

Tkßoyal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 months
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards

valuable addition to baby’s dietary
when ten months old and after These
Rusks are specially useful during the
troublesome time of teething. When
eaten raw they mechanically aid the
cutting of teeth.

vigorous health and develop-
ment, and represent the most

TOO THIN
WOMEN.
If you are flat-
chested, thin,
run down and
scraggly—even if you never had a
nicely-rounded bosom, Dr. Fai-
lure's Flesh-Food will build you
up and develop your figure. Does
your mirror mock you ? Flesh-
Food will remove the faults in
your figure by rounding out and
developing the deficient places.
Put up in Tablet form, it is easy
to use and pleasant to take, and,
if desired, may be taken secretly.
Taken under our directions, it
will work wonders for your ap-
pearance. Thousands of grateful
women fully endorse it.
In many cases bust measure-
ments have been increased by
over ten inches, and the weight
over five pounds weekly. Other
cases have shown an increase in
weight of even a pound a day.
The average bust increase desired
is about six inches, and is readily
accomplished. Results invariably guaranteed.
1< LliSii-t OOD offers relief and development to
the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable
figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to
attenuated women.
TOO FAT
PEOPLE.
Excess fat in-
j ures you r
health, impedes
your movements, and makes you
the butt of your unfeeling nor-
mal-weight friends. People who
have been fat, and are now re-
duced to normal, think other
fat people ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat in-
jure your health and endanger
your existence, it absolutely
destroys your figure and makes
you a luelicrous sight. Wbv do
you stay fat? “FATCUUE”
positive, y removes excess fat,
and will restore your spo led
figure to decent and pleasing
proportions, and is always a
sure and lasting cure for obesity
and corpulency. A few doses
improves your breathing won-
derfully, and the course of treat-
ment will cure you.
It is the onlv successful, and.
at the same time, harmless, fat-reducer that
has ever been discovered. Its efficacy has been
undeniably demonstrated in thousands of suc-
cessfully treated cases. It is totally and abso-
lutely non-poisonous, and can in no wise work
any injury to the general health; though it
often reduces excess weight by as much as a
pound a day. You should try it at once.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since 1 last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
uke of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

Auntie.
A remarkable instance of absent-mindedness is re-
ported from Port Melbourne. A young woman called
upon her married sister and took the latter’s baby
for a ride in its go-cart. While the young woman
went into a draper’s shop the child was left on the
footpath. On completing her purchases, the aunt
returned home, overlooking the infant in her care. It
was not until the evening, when the mother sent to
her sister for the baby, that the latter recollected
that she had taken the child out and forgotten it.
Subsequently, the baby was handed over to its mother
by the police. —News item.
Poor Auntie lives a sort of trance;
Unwed herself, she tries to seize
Some part from those who have a chance
To sample Life’s realities ;
So now and then she throws away
The novel full of shams and talk,
Abducts the real live babe and shay,
And takes the squaller for a walk.
The thin book shadows throng her brain,
As through the living world she hies;
In half an hour she pants again
To drain romance with her dim eyes;
Before the spectacles that look
Like engine windows, round and large
She holds once more the printed book,
And quite forgets her living charge. '
Within the cloth-bound, inkish dream
The author wove for her delight
She sinks, behind the specs that gleam.
The world and baby fade from sight,
She’s “off” again, and so she stays
Until the sun into the sea
Goes down, amid a ruddy haze.
(The baby screams incessantly.)
Poor Auntie lives a sort of trance
Within a dreambound book or shop ;
The babe, with rage-flushed countenance,
Within the living world must stop.
Stout coppers lullabies intone,
And strive with milk to stop its screams,
While Auntie glideth on alone
Arrayed in spectacles and dreams.

Though rubber-shares I’m scared ofi
Late Duke of Fife.
And. I’m relieved, now that he’s dead,
The Duke of Fife, in Surrey,
Will need no more the tears I shed ;
There is no cause to worry.
He’s in his vault deposited—-
With Dukes there seems no hurry.

For it is Arcady and June,
And young Alpheus runs below.
Fill, fill your reeds, ye shepherd shades!
Leap, naiad of the shining pool!
Old wonder lights the wreath that braids
The forehead of the happy fool.
Leaf-strewn is all our paper glade,
But dreaming feet are faint and slow
To catch the noisy music made
In Greece three thousand years ago.
The days are changed, the gods are dead,
The tram-wires to the night complain—
Oh. ; ! a?ant frolic, folly bred,
The joys are gone, the fools remain !

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tub Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, Tub Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE GOOD DAYS OF PROTECTION IN
ENGLAND.
The spread of knowledge butts down many
queer old gods from their pedestals, and
with the advance of education John Bull’s
Freetrade joss begins to totter visibly. But
for the political company which Protection
keeps in Britain, or, rather, but for certain
persons who insist on keeping company with
it for their own ends, the joss on the eleva-
tion would certainly totter a great deal
more than it does. Despite all the popularity
which the Asquith Ministry has bought, oT
attempted to buy, by its programme of social
reform, there are already doubts, even among
the old hardshell believers, about its dura-
bility and its prospects. The CoBDEN-itish
idol begins to be somewhat of a load to carry.
Forty years ago, or even 20 years ago, things
were very much otherwise, but events have
been moving rapidly of late. Freetrade be-
came a sort of definite institution in Bull’s
Land just about the time when the world’s
gold production suddenly jumped from about
£20,000,000 in 10 years to £282.000,000 for
one ten-year period, £264,000,000 for the
next, and £241.000.000 in the third —say
about £700.000.000 for the 80 years between
1850 and 1880; and the silver output also
doubled or thereabouts. The greatest com-
mercial boom in history was built on this
superabundance of coin—such a superabun-
dance as the, world had never known before.
Britain’s share of the boom arrived coinci-
dently with the practical abolition of the
corn-laws, so it was held by many that one
caused the other, just as Tenterden steeple
caused the Godwin Sands and Napoleon
lll.’s new dog caused the Franco-German
war. The Freetraders claimed the wonderful
upheaval as the result of their policy; and
the unthinking mass let it go at that; and
the cheap crude folk who write little school
histories—the only histories which most
people read- —don’t spare space for any ex-
haustive examination of an intricate
case of that sort. The school his-
tory book, with its simple _ legends
and superficial tales, is a poor thing at all
times, and it seldom has even the virtue of
being amusing. Now there grows, among a
large section of the people, a tendency to
look for better evidence. Because of the
growth of education, Freetrade threatens to
go the way of the personal devil, and the
material Sheol, and the kraken and Prester
John, and the legendary people who wore
their faces under their shoulders. The old
British days of high Protection had their
merits, and since the sonorous bray of the
Freetrader has lost some of its deafening
character, and the CoBDEN-ite has had to
relax some portion of his aspect of infalli-
bility, these merits begin to emerge again.
* * * *
Nobody can fix the date when Protection
began in England any more than the date
when it ended. These things don’t happen
all of a sudden, except in school histories,
and it is only possible to make an approxi-
mation. But really high Protection was
forced on the country by the Napoleon-ic
campaigns, and if the system was rotten, it
is a marvel how the land carried its burdens.
The war lasted some 22 years, and the cost
was tremendous. Despite the fact that almost
all taxes were trebled —the income tax alone
swallowed one-tenth of the average man’s
receipts—at the end of the trouble Britain
owed at least £900,000,000 (some estimates
are £950,000,000), equal, with the small pop-
ulation to those days, to £45 of wholly un-
productive debt per inhabitant. That is
twice as bad as the position of Tasmania,
which has been holding out a despairful hat
to the Commonwealth Treasury for
aid; and more than four times as bad
as the situation of Australia in general.
The private wealth of the country averaged
£177 per head when the war began, and only
£l2O when it ended, and much more than
one-third of this scanty remainder was in
pawn. Even the humblest cottager who pos-
sessed three chairs owed one of them, and
part of a second, to the State. The country
had lost over 10,000 ships of one kind and
another, and many things besides. As a
side-issue of the NAPOLEON-ic disturbance, it
had fought an unsuccessful war at sea with
the United States, to the great damage of its
commerce; in fact, the damage was so
bad that, until the U.S. wrecked its
mercantile marine in the Civil War,
Britain was glad at times to take
second place as a carrier by sea.
And it was loaded with an incredi-
ble burden of pauperism, for it had on
its hands the widows and orphans and
cripples of 22 years of strife and misery. The
scarcity of money was amazing as compared
with the present day, for the goldfields of the
United States, Alaska, Australia. Maori-
land and South Africa hadn’t yet been dis-
covered. The whole world was supposed to
be producing about as much of the precious
metal as Victoria alone digs out, even to-
day, though this is a decadent sort of day,
and the Victorian gold industry approaches
its last legs. The revenue looked hardly
sufficient to cover interest on the public debt
alone, leaving nothing for defence, education
or sundries. The disproportion between the
bill to be paid and the wherewithal to pay
it was grotesque beyond words.
* * * *
Then, with the beginning of peace, High
Protectionist Britain put its shoulder to the
wheel. It was at first a cold and bitter
time of poverty, long hours and low wages.
Machinery was still primitive, though it was
improving fast. About the beginning of last
century two capable able-bodied weavers,
aged 30 years or so (men in their prime),
could produce just one-eleventh as much
cotton shirting as a youth of 18, with a 14-
year-old girl to help him, could turn out in
1845, and yet in 1845 machinery was far
from being of the best. Not even Protection
could turn the hand-loom into a power-loom,
any more than the purely Freetrade methods
of the Australian aboriginal could turn his
humpy into a stone mansion, or his boom-
erang into a rifle. Also, the raw material
which the slow old cotton artisan used cost
about seven times as much as it does now.
The nigger on the U.S. plantation used to
pick the seeds out of cotton by hand, and
even the most cordial flogging didn’t get him
beyond the rate of one or two lb. of stuff
per day. Then Whitney’s gin was devised,
and it enabled one nigger in this branch of
the industry to do the work that used to em-
ploy 1000 or 1500 Africans. And cotton
didn’t stand alone. Wool was also scarce
and dear about Napoleon’s time, for Aus-
tralasia and South Africa and South
America hadn’t begun to supply it in stupen-
dous quantities, and what wool there was
was prepared almost entirely by hand. It
was much the same in all other industries.
People worked of necessity hours which
now seem like sheer inhumanity—it was
necessary to do that with the primitive
anpliances of the neriod or else go naked.
If men, about 1815, had toiled eight hours
per day, and there had been the same re-
strictions on female and child labor as there
are now, the Englishman, with his old appli-
ances, would have produced about enough
goods to enable him to live as a superior
kind of cave-dweller or tree-man. So he
made the best of things, and, as already men-
tioned, he put his shoulder to the wheel after
Waterloo. By the time of the practical
abolition of the Corn Laws, Britain had paid
off nearly £200,000.000 of the debt incubus.
The aggregate private wealth of the country
bad about doubled, so far as estimates go—
that is to say, Britain, without any very
great new opportunities, had accumulated
fully £2,200,000,000 of new capital. A vast
mass of war taxes had been removed. And
the country had acquired a business pre-
eminence such as it never possessed before,
and which it doesn’t possess now. It was
the world’s greatest industrial State —in
fact, it supplied nearly one-third of all the
world’s manufactures It owned more steam-
power than all the rest of Europe put toge-
ther, and one-third of all the steam-power
on earth. It owned nearly half the world s
banking capital. Its share of the world s
commerce was, if anything, a shade larger
than it is to-day. In 30 or 35 years Protec-
tionist Britain rose from what looked like
hopeless insolvency to an undisputed front
position among the nations.
* * * *
It was the day of comparatively small
things, but of such things as were going,
Britain got its share, and a great deal more.
The new Freetrade system, which arrived
later, had the advantage of greatly improved
machinery, though in almost every case the
foundations of the improvement were laid
under the old regime; of vastly improved
means of communication, though railroads
and steamships and telegraphs all commenced
under the previous order of things; and,
above all, it got the advantage, through the
accident of the great gold discoveries, of
such a mass of capital as the world had
never seen before. It commenced the game
on a good wicket, when the old Protectionist
Governments had reduced the British debt
burden per head by nearly one.-half. As a
matter of fact, the old order was, to some
extent, ruined by its own success. Britain
became so supreme in manufactures that the
impression arose that it didn’t require defence
—that it would always lead under every pos-
sible set of circumstances because Provi-
dence had built it that way. Bull’s coun-
try conceived the idea that it might, by set-
ting a bright and shining example, persuade
all the world to admit its products free. It
was to be, in the exact words of the early
Freetraders, “the world’s workshop,’’ and the
rest of the globe was to grow raw materials
for the workshop, and lead the primitive life.
The arrangement came off, to some extent,
for a while, but now the last semblance of it
has fallen through. Britain is a greater
place in many respects than it was in the
high Protectionist times, for things are on a
bigger scale the whole world over. But. in
quite a number of directions it ranks third,
where it used to rank first. So it
begins to dawn on Bull —or on part,
at least, of Bull —that perhaps the old Pro-
tectionist days were very good days in their
way—that, considering the world’s limita-
tions 60 years ago, they were better days
than the present ones.
THE UNSPEAKABLE TURK.
Dear Bulletin. —All the recent news from
Europe indicates that .John Bull’s old
friend, the Unspeakable Turk, is at it again.
The more or less chronic alliance between
Btttt, and this turbaned person, the worst
scoundrel in a white man’s continent, has
always been something of a mystery. Cer-
tainly it is by no merits of his own that
Abdul Fez attained to Britain’s friendship
and support, and preserved it for so many
years. All that can be said against the
Ottoman is that he is a polygamist, an in-
dividual who doubts whether woman is the
possessor of a soul, an utterly unlettered
ruffian except where he has acquired a mea-
sure or smattering of exotic information, a
person who hardly even possesses an alpha-
bet of his own, a thick-headed intruder who
has never invented anything save lies and
wickedness and treachery, a bigot of the
worst description, a fatalist, a destroyer, an
extortioner, a loafer, a procrastinator, a slov-
enly drifter, an incapable, a citizen whose
Capacity for cruelty is over the odds, a
shuffler and breaker of oaths, a tyrant, a
stumbling-block in the path of progress, a
public disgrace, a monument of superstition,
a blot on the landscape, and a hard smoker.
All that can be said in his favor is that he
doesn’t drink to excess, and that he has a.
certain measure of courage. These things
are not much, but they are something. For
a long time it has been the general policy of
Britain to keep this unpleasant anomaly
in possession of the corner of Europe which
he embezzled from the Greeks a few Cen-
turies ago. The policy commenced with the
beginning of the Russian scare, which scare is
one of the inexplicable circumstances of last
century. Out of nothing visible or percept-
ible arose an impression concerning the
boundless ambition of the Russian, who has
generally annexed one square mile of land
where Britain annexed two; concerning his
alleged designs on India, which is probably
not worth taking; concerning his military
ability, which has never been shown to any
great extent save in defensive warfare,
though a vast and wooden-headed bravery
has never been denied him; and concerning
his tremendous naval possibilities, despite
the fact that he has always been a cumbrous
ass on the waters, and has never risen even
to the marine level of Venice or Portugal,
Out of an idea that the Russ is a stupendous
danger—-an idea apparently based on the
fact that his frozen spaces loom very large
on the map —a habit grew up of coddling
the unspeakable and incapable and undrink-
able Turk, lest the Muscovite should
get Constantinople, and his ill-managed and
leaky marine squadrons should then do
something of a lumbering and unspecified
but terrible character to the Suez Canal.
* * * *
That the Turk has not beep a credit to
Europe is so obvious that the mqtter scarcely
requires elaboration. Even about his fight-
ing capacity, which is the one virtue that is
supposed to be beyond all question, there is
a possible shadow of doubt. Certainly the
original Turk had a great fighting capacity
for a time. One of the peculiarities of Asia,
when Asia was independent, was the sudden
and temporary upheaval of nations. Folk
who had mouldered in the back row from the
beginning of time, merely rising up and
going to bed, wearing clothes, getting their
hair cut occasionally, leading the plain agri-
cultural or bovine, life, eating horse and
drinking what they could squeeze out of the
she-camel, would suddenly become inspired
or possessed with devils. Then they rose at
such short notice that there wasn’t even
time for the Speaker to call them to order,
and clamored furiously out of their turn. In-
cidentally, they built empires and burned
cities, and disembowelled women, and swept
over adjacent States like a hurricane, and
threw clods at the Almighty, and threat-
ened to establish a world-wide sovereignty.
After that they burst like a worn-out balloon
or a decayed egg, and were seen no more.
The Ivins and the Ivhitans; the Moguls; the
Turkomans of Ghuznee, and the Afghans of
Ghor; the Jews, with their momentary em-
pire and their long-succeeding misery; the
Seljuks, the shifty empire of Kharezm,
the Caliphate of Bagdad, which blossomed
in a night, so to speak, and perish-
ed next morning; and a number of other
States and peoples rose with great glory,
and then fell into great obliteration. In the
ordinary course of Asiatic affairs the Turks
should have gone the same road. There was
apparently no more epduring element in
them than in other Asiatic races which
blossomed for no visible reason, and for an
hour or so blotted out the sun, and then
were cast into the unstable ash-heap of his-
tory. According to all the rules of the game,
the Greek emperors should have "been back at
Constantinople about 50 years after the
loss of that city, and a new and stronger
Greece should have arisen on the ruins of
the old one. But, by some accident, there
had occurred to the Chief Scoundrel or First
Murderer or Boss Slayer of the new race
an idea. It was almost the only bright idea
the Turkish race ever possessed. Out of
this inspiration arose the habit of levying on
the little Christian kingdoms which had been
conquered the tribute of male children. These
stolen children lost their names and their
identity. They were brought up in Turkish
military schools according to the strictest
tenets of Islam. They became, under this
mode of training, more Turkish than the
Turks themselves. The multitude of kid-
napped Christian infants formed, for several
hundred years, the backbone of the army
with which the Unspeakable Turk held
Europe in terror. They supplied most of
the power which enforced the tribute of chil-
dren for one generation after another, and
thus they kept the rotten machine moving.
The wholesale purchase or stealing of Cir-
cassian girls added another strain of fighting
blood and another streak of intelligence to
the Ottoman race. All this wasn’t sufficient
to prevent the Turk being the prize ruffian
and incapable of Europe, but it helped to
keep him on his military legs in a sense, and
to prevent him going," in short order, the
way he would probably have gone without
extraneous aid.
* * * *
The Turk has reformed so often within
recent times that the mere list of his -swear-
ings-off has become wearisome. He has twice
established a Parliament, and each Parlia-
ment was worse than the other, and as
bad as both of them put together. He has
about six times within the last 60 yc ars,
assured the Great Powers that he would
put all races and creeds on a level; abolish
extortion, bribery, massacre, violence, tor-
ture, and the sale of justice, and walk the
chalk line of rectitude for the rest of his
days. Usually the reformation seemed to
make him a shade worse than before. When
the Young Turk recently arose in all his
glory, and wreaked a just vengeance on the
bad old Turk, Europe, despite all its previ-
ous disappointments, held out the glad hand
—with a trifle of loan money in it —and
said that at last south-eastern Europe and
western Asia were going to be cleaned up.
It proved that one big tyrant had departed
to make room for 500 small ones, and for a
moth-eaten figurehead that had been in prison
for 30 years. The old injustice and cruelty
and corruption, the old bigotry and slaughter
all remain.
* * * *
The trouble is that the Turk can’t reform
except by committing suicide. He repre-
sents a religious movement (save that it
doesn’t move) rather than a nation. If he
lets go his religion, he loses the bond which
keeps the community together. The key-
stone of the arch which holds him up is the
fact that the Sultan is the alleged Caliph—
the Commander of the Faithful; and can,
at the last resort, call on the Moslem world
to rally round him. He has no actual right
to the position, which can only be held by a
person of Arabian descent, but a previous
Sultan —an armed and bounceable person —
scared the legitimate Commander, who
was elderly and decayed and of mild
habits, into handing over his right, title
and dignity, much as a negro might
terrorise an English duke into transferring
his pedigree, his ancestors and his family
traditions. The Ottoman can no more re-
form and yet remain what he is than a Pope
can become a Primitive Methodist and yet
continue head of the Roman Church, or
than a Thug could be converted to Quaker-
ism and still continue tliugging. The job
with which the very existence off the nation
is bound up is moored to the strictest inter-
pretation of a seventh-century creed- —a
creed which embodies such a gigantic con-
tempt for all non-Moslems that compromise
is impossible, and reconciliation
worse than impossible. If the Ottoman were
to let go his bigotry the Turkish minority
would presently be absorbed by inter-
marriage with the Christian majority, and
there would be no more Turk. As he doesn’t
let it go, the Christian majority will still
object to be ruled by an ignorant gang of
polygamists—just as the people of the
United States would object to be ruled by
Mormons. On the face qf things, there is no
remedy for the Incurable Turk save oblitera-
tion. It is necessary to hustle him out of
Europe; and to prohibit liis religion, his
harem, his fez, and all his works. He is
over the odds and beyond the limit. It is
impossible for any peaceful community to
make terms with a brigand while he remains
a brigand, and it is impossible for any Euro-
pean community to make terms with a
Turk while he is a Turk. Europe has had
some 500 years experience of him, and when
that experience is viewed from A to Z, and
from Genesis to Revelation, the verdict is
that the Asiatic is an undesirable citizen.
And when he is gone back to his old haunts
it will probably take five centuries to wash
up after him. —Yours, etc.,
HENRY HORSECOLLAR.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Ungrateful Crib-Cracker.
O’Callaghan, Chief Commissioner of Vic.
Police, and his old pal and supporter, John
Weary, had a dirty trick played upon them
last week. The inefficiency of local police
protection, coupled with the unfitness of
O’Callaghan for his billet, have been par-
ticular matters of Melbourne newspaper
comment for many months, even years. To
every outcry for reform of the Police system
O’Callagiian has protested that the Force
was capable, vigilant and well-ordered,
whilst friend John Weary has added his
tribute to the transcendent merits of the
Chief Commissioner. Urged to replace the


67-year-old figurehead with an abler and
harder working administrator, the tired
Mubbay has audaciously declared that no
change could be for the better. O’Calla-
ghan remained enthroned as the one true
god of Bobbydom, the inspectors were his
archangels, and the Chief Secretary was his
prophet. And all who did not believe could
consider rhemselves d —d. This was the posi-
tion until last week. Then the dirty trick
eventuated. By the rules of fair play, all
the trades union burglars and sneak thieves
in Melbourne and suburbs were bound to
abstain from depredations on the premises of
any citizen connected with the press. It
was obvious that the murdering, garrotting
or indoor-plundering of anybody concerned
in the aspersions frequently cast on the
character of local police protection would be
tantamount to a blow struck at its cham-
pions. No reform of police administration
was to be feared as long as its representa-
tive critics were left unmolested. O’Calla-
ghan and Weaey stood in much the same
position as the British railway directors of
old who were said to be immune from all
serious responsibility for collisions on the
line provided that no bishop was killed or
wounded. Therefore, the Police Commis-
sioner and his political boss felt themselves
scandalously treated, as it were, when a
burglary took place at the home of Geoffeey
Syme, a proprietor of the Age newspaper,
who captured one of the marauders after a
willing go, and is charging him with at-
tempted murder. An ordinary thief, or a
mere commonplace housebreaker who flees
discovery like a rat, would have been a suffi-
ciently forcible text for another newspaper
sermon on the sins of the O’Callagiian-
Weaby regime. A combative Sikes who
fired five bullets at Geoffeey, shot him in
the arm and jabbed him in the chest with a
pair of wire-clippers, was nothing less than
a horrible example of what may happen to
a daily journal proprietor under the present
lax system of police protection. Nothing
now remains for O’Callaghan but to put
his diminished head in a bag and totter
out of office, pursued by the blessings of
friend Weaey and the jeers of a scornful
populace. He has uttered a glowing eulogy
upon Mr. Syme’s services to the community
in “capturing a notorious criminal who has
preyed upon people in various States of the
Commonwealth” —and who would possibly
have damaged a policeman had he chanced
to meet one in his burglaries. But Geoffeey
Syme’s testimonial to O’Callagkan has
not yet been published.

Exit Booth.
One of the strangest chapters in the history
of religions closes with the death of General
Booth. The Salv’army affair which he
called into being was perhaps of all things
that could be conceived the one most out of
touch with the spirit of that bizarre period
we call the Nineteenth Century, though that
was the century which gave birth to Mor-
monism and DowiE-ism. Yet Booth, by
his skill as an organiser, or his tremendous
self-confidence, or his fanaticism, or what
you will, contrived to gain a huge success
for his institution. When creeds were weak-
ening before the onslaught of science, he
chose to stand or fall by the crudest and
darkest of all creeds. When most men had
become democrats, he founded an autocracy
as rigid as that of William the Norman.
The big drum advertised him, and the de-
cayed eggs which so persistently followed
his early efforts supplied the touch of mar-
tyrdom necessary to win him sympathy. The
Salv’army boomed in the early ’Bo’s, and
slumped in the latter part of the same
decade. But the person with the keen eye
and the Carthaginian countenance hadn’t
the least intention of letffng go. The reli-
gious appeal of his movement having weak-
ened, he launched his social schemes and
took England by storm. The business of
saving souls dropped to second place, and
that of running laundries and cheap hotels
took precedence. They weren’t very bright
hotels, nor very cheerful laundries, but the
world accepted them as well-meant, like the
attentions paid to the police _ in “The
Pirates of Penzance,” and poured in a steady
stream of cash to keep them going. Out-
posts of the Salv’army, which for the most
part were mere coin-collecting agencies, were
to be found in all countries. Yet the
machinery which was constructed to give
refuge to a few deadbeats and bread to a
few of the hungry seemed tremendously cum-
bersome, and out of all proportion to the
actual work done. Revolutions are not
stopped with weak tea and stale buns.
Booth’s palliatives were of small real value
to the poor, in that they helped to hinder re-
forms by blinding the hungry to the full
extent of their miseries. His was not a
logical mind. A very little tariff and land
reform would have done more to uplift the
East End of London than all his drum-beat-
ing in the cause of twopenny doss-houses.
Still, he was a grafter, and if his stupendous
exertions didn’t get the world much further
forward, he at least stands out above all
merely Wowserish logic-choppers and pulpit-
bangers as a man who tried to be practical
when sectarianism had run to seed. The
organisation of which he was the head will
probably crumble to ruins round his ashes,
and the fact that he kept it going so long
is a tribute to the real energy and power of
the man.
A Small Man Grapples with a Large
Question.
“Seafakeb” writes: —
Apparently the Titanic disaster has moved Premier
Watt, of Victoria, to consider that long-neglected
public question, the lack of life-saving facilities on
the steamers that ply on Port Phillip Bay and there-
abouts. First he ascertained some surprising facts.
Then he instructed the State engineer for ports and
harbors to report thereon. Next, he invited the
Marine Board to express an opinion. Now, finding
that these parties are satisfied with the existing con-
ditions, he intends to appoint Judge Box and two
assistants as a Board to “investigate the problem and
report thereon.” Heaven knows what the blessed
Plank is to investigate; for Watt's facts were solid
enough. Here are a few of them: One Bay excursion
steamer, licensed to carry 1144 people, could, in an
emergency, find room for 30 in its boats. “18 on rafts
and 12 on life-buoys—the other 1074 would get life-
belts or nothing. Another is licensed for 1103. It can
provide for 55 in boats, 96 on buoyant deck seats, and
60 on buoys. Another is allowed to take on board 1987
souls —its boats could save 84, and its life-buoys 12.
The rest would take pot luck, and pots don’t float
well. Ther rest of the Bay steamers are similarly
unprovided. On a fine holiday, say Boxing Dav,
these three steamers, which on such occasions are
notoriously overcrowded—several captains have been
fined because of that fact—would take afloat some-
thing like 5000 souls, and if one of the many dancers
of the sea brought disaster to them, less than 200
might get into the boats available, if the utensils
weren’t capsized in the struggle. These facts look
solid enough, but the report on which the precious
Marine Board based its opinion that everything was
as good and pretty as a summer rainbow, is even more
weighty. It sets forth the State of affairs thusly •

That is an official statement of the position, and if
Watt's Board sits till all the cows come .home, it
can find out no more —and no worse. Also, it will be
able to discover no better reasons for this thrittiness
in providing life-saving facilities than those given
by the same Marine Board, viz.—“the avoidance of
undue encumbrance of the ship’s deck,” and the fear
that “the provision of additional boats would, in the
event of a serious casualty, cause such a rush to enter
them as would entail a serious loss of life’—which
last excuse is about the most brilliant piece of
humor this writer has met for some time. In the
face of this report, it should be obvious even to
Watt that there is no need to investigate the problem.
The problem is there. It stands up like a Himalaya.
The Fight for the Exemptions.
As was to be expected, the Tory press takes
up the standpoint that foreign ships must
be exempted entirely from the conditions of
the Navigation Bill, now before the Aus-
tralian Parliament. It would be too auda-
cious even for the organs of importerdom to
propound this unpatriotic view in so. many
words, and so it is done by a side-wind, as
it were. In the opinion, for example, of
Sydney Telegraph (23/8/T2) :
When the Australian Steamship Owners’ Federa-
tion proposes that all vessels engaging in the coast-
wise trade shall be made to comply with the law
and pay the same wages as the Australian shipping,
it asks what is impracticable.
And the paper goes on to remark, sadly,
warningly, on the likelihood of the overseas
companies dropping the coastal passenger
carrying side of their business “in preference
to continuing it at the impossible price of
obeying the navigation law.” The first ques-
tion that will occur to the unbiassed student
of this matter is: Why should the foreign
cos. be driven to so extreme a step? All
that the Navigation Bill demands of them
is that they shall pay white men’s wages
and provide white men’s accommodation for
their crews while in Australian waters. (It
is pretty certain that the subsidy proviso
will be evaded by most of them, and with
some ease.) Is it such an intolerable hard-
ship, after all, that these affluent concerns
should be required to drop the evil practice
of employing sweated aliens during such
time as they are competing with local steam-
ers which give employment, at decent wages,
to Caucasian sailor-men? In this paper’s
opinion, the class of steamship co. which re-
fuses to try and live without cheao nigger
labor does not merit the tear of maudlin sym-
pathy by any manner of means. And when
it has the chilled-steel nerve to claim that it
and its ilKpaid savage should be permitted
to unrestrictedly, with white-
manned Australian ships, it merits not so
much a tear as half a brick, or something
even more lethal. Toryism is on equally
frail, not to say rotten, grounds, when it
seeks to show that the withdrawal of the
oversea liners, which specialise in underpaid
or nigger crews, from the coastal passenger
carrying trade will be a terrific blow to the
Australian tripper. Said the Telegraph in
the issue above-quoted :
Many people prefer to travel by the big liners
for several good reasons, and importantly because of
the advantages incidental to the size of these vessels
and their speed; many, in fact, might not travel if
they could not make their voyage in an ocean boat.
The uninstructed would be liable to gather
from this that the ships plying up and down
the Australian coast are a collection of in-
secure and comfortless cockle-shells, and that
they bear no sort of comparison to the splen-
did craft of the foreigner. The reverse is
the case. It is a truism of the seafaring
world that there are no finer coastal steam-
ers anywhere than those in Australian
waters. Many of them are bigger, safer and
more comfortable than any of the foreign
liners of two or three years back. And they
are equal to most of the visiting foreign
steamers of to-day. In the very issue of the
very paper which blithered of ‘‘the advan-
tages incidental to the size” of the foreign
ships were advertisements of the
of the Karoola (7391 tons) the Kanowna
(7000 tons), the Wyreema (6500 tons),
the Warilda (8000 tons), and the Levuka
(6500 tons). They compare satisfac-
torily enough with such “ocean boats”
as the Prinz Waldemar (3300 tons),
the Coblentz (3300 tons) and the
Prinz Sigismund (3300 tons) ; nor do
they pale into utter insignificance beside
the Omrah (8130 tons), the Orontes (9023
tons), both of which somewhat elderly craft
figure on the shipping page of last Friday’s
Telegraph, as well as five well-matured
8000 tonners of the Nord-Deutscher line. The
palpable truth is that Toryism has no case
in its present agitation in favor of fdreign
shipping being exempted from the provisions
of the Navigation Bill to the detriment of
the Australian coasters. There is no justifi-
cation for it in equity or as a matter of
business fairness; the travelling public
doesn’t want it; and to Australians, who
desire, from a defence standpoint, to see
their national mercantile marine encouraged
and protected in every possible way, the
movement is utterly abhorrent.

A Practice Wherein the Chow May Not
Emulate the Caucasian.
Last week, one Lou Guar, of Lilly Buck-
stleet, Melbourne, sued a city tailoring com-
pany for a paltry sum—alleged deposit on a
collar-stud, which proved a misfit, or some-
thing of the kind. When the case came on
for hearing it was found that Ni Gan, solici-
tor for the plaintiff, was absent. Guar,
explained distractedly to Judge Eagleson,
through an interpreter, that he had
paid his dilatory countryman £5 to
plead his case, and he inquired, as well as
a mere Chow speaking through the mouth of
another could, whether British justice was
dead, or only doped, that such dishonesties
should be. Also, he asked what was going
to happen to his fiver, and to the elusive Ni
Gan, and several other queries bearing on
the same topic. Then did the Law suddenly
arise in its scandalised majesty, and give
Ni Gan particular Hades, likewise Cain
and the Devil. Brushing aside the apologies
and protestations of a legal subSTitute, whom
Gan had sent to handle Ghar’s case in his
stead, Judge Eagleson remarked on the ob-
vious fact that Gan was not there in per-
son. Yet, pursued the Judge with pitiless
logic, he had been paid £5 to attend, and,
consequently, he had obtained the money by
irregular means. If it wasn’t refunded by
the following morning, concluded the speaker,
in tones of cold menace, the world would
hear a sound as of something falling from
a vast height, and the victim of the catas-
trophe would be Solicitor Ni Gan. The
hint was amply sufficient. Ghar was able
to show his Honor Gan’s cheque for £5 the
next morning, and the incident ended, honor
being satisfied all round. The lesson to be
deduced from this episode is that, in law,
the Chow and the Caucasian stand on a
different footing. White advocates are doing
with absolute impunity, every day that the
Courts sit, what Ni Gan was flagellated for
attempting to do last week. The only real
difference lies in the fact that the white
sharks operate on a much larger scale. It
is a recognised custom of the legal trade for
K.C.’s and similar exalted folk to accept big
fees for work they don’t perform, and never
intended to perform. The political K.C.
thinks nothing of accepting a brief, together
with the accompanying fee, insisting on get-
ting his retaining fee and other emoluments,
and then blandly leaving his native bailiwick
of Sydney, or Adelaide, or wherever it is,
hieing him back to Melbourne, and abandon-
ing the interests of _ his client to a
callow junior. There is a type of bar-
rister who can always be bought or bribed
(use which term you will) to desert one
court and argue in another; and there is
another frequent type who can always be got
sufficiently drunk by the enemy to preclude
him from appearing in any court at all.
Yet both of these types, in common with the
K.C. above referred to, insist on their whole
pound of financial flesh in the matter of fees;
and, since payments are mostly made in ad-
vance in these matters, they stand on velvet.
The whole thing is a rank and glaring
swindle, and amounts to the obtaining of
money under false pretences, in that offence’s
crudest form. Whv the High Court and
Supreme Court Judges don’t leap on those
advocates who so offend, in the decisive
fashion that Eagleson recently bounded
upon Mr. Ni Gan, over a much smaller mat-
ter, is explicable only by the circumstance
that a large majority of the potentates have
achieved fame and wealth themselves by
those very practices.
An Advocate of Sweated Industries.
A revenue-tariff Customs Minister or a
Protectionist Customs Minister in a revenue
tariff administration (both of which catas-
trophes are the same, for all practical pur-
poses) has a trying time in a country which
is fairly howling for genuine tariff reform.
And, consequently, the life of Tudor,
M.H.R., is not a happy one. At a recent
deputation of employers and employees in
the Australian jewellery trade, one manufac-
turer stated that he imported £IO.OOO worth
of jewellery in 1911, as against £4OOO worth
in 1906. Or, to put it another way, he
found it good business to give £6OOO worth
more work to total strangers last year than
he did five years ago. The stuff he imports
comes cheaper to him, duty paid, than any
he can make at current wages. It is the
product of sweated labor. Higher protec-
tiou would enable him to make the same
thing or something better of the same kind in
Australia. The disingenuous Tudor could
not strike an attitude of deep sympathy with
Labor, and talk vaguely of raising the
tariff when the jewellery manufacturers'
paid higher wages. So he took the point that
whilst Australia’s consumption of imported
jewellery has increased enormously the de-
mand for local products in jewellery has in-
creased a little. Also, he remarked that
this last year of general prosperity was the
best that the manufacturers had known,
wherefore they had nothing to grumble at.
Why want to employ more labor in making
goods which it pa T, s them to import? In
other words, why aspire to give a job to an
Australian when it is possible to make a
profit by handing it to a low-wage foreigner?
It was this very question that the short-
sighted jewellers of Sydney (importers to a
man) propounded when the approach of
Federation threw a dark tariff shadow over
their trade. One of the biggest firms was
almost hopeless about the matter. The
partners had practically decided to shift
their business to London, when one, greatly
daring, said that taking into consideration
their established position, and so forth, they
might as well attempt the forlorn hope of
making their own goods if only for a year
or so. They did. To-day their business has
quadrupled itself. The appearance of their
shop rivals that of similar establishments in
Bond-street and the Rue de la Paix. They
are bursting with affluence, and so are their
rivals. The profits are the result, mainly,
of a balanced system of fair protection and
commensurate wages. The balance has been
disturbed, latterly, by a series of wage in-
creases, and so the importing side of the
jewellery trade is once more getting ahead
of the manufacturing side —with particularly
disastrous effects on the welfare of the em-
ployees. Nationalists claim that a re-ad-
justment of the tariff is the only cure for
them. What answer has Labor’s Customs
Minister to make to this contention?
As many people feared, when they consid-
ered External Affairs Minister Thomas and
his amazing spinelessness, that invertebrate
politician has weakened on his decision to
send Mrs. Poon Gooey back whence she
came. In so doing, Thomas has not only
derided and flouted Australia’s and his
party’s declared White policy, but has shown
himself a complete failure. It has been
proved that Hop Poon knew exactly what
he was doing when he imported his wife,
and also when, at the expiration of the first
extension of “leave,” he broke his promise
not to ask for a further extension. Also,
Thomas himself states that the same Poon
showed himself hazy and disingenuous by
asking for a further extension in order to
wind up his business, whereas he now states
that he has no intention of doing so, but
proposes to continue here and keep Mrs.
Poon, if he may, or let her rip, if she must.
In short, Poon admits that he has gained
the extensions by deceit, and apparently he
intends to continue them by bluff, if Thomas
is agreeable. That supine person, having
last May signed the order for deportation,
has since been treated t® all manner of in-
sults and vilification —and apparently he
likes it, for he now allows a further exten-
sion of Mrs. Poon’s “leave” “until such
time as a Government medical officer certifies
that she is able to travel.” And then Hop
Poon, entrenched behind new arguments and
strengthened by a fresh precedent, will start
the discussion all over again, and his Wow-
ser barrackers will create a new uproar.
Meantime, Thomas soothes his conscience
with the assurance that a “stricter policy is
to be enforced,” and he is “going to be more
stringent in granting these exemptions.”
Melbourne’s unwieldy Board .of Shirks
suffers from an unduly developed seise of its
own importance. Nobody asked its opinion,
but, the other day, it flung in the face of a
heedless public a document modestly setting
forth its idea of the coming Greater Mel-
bourne scheme. Its manifesto was to the
effect that IT—the same old Board of Shirks
at which so many clods have been hurled —in
addition to the various jobs over which it
now has control, should be given charge of
the fire-brigade service, Yarra improvements,
metropolitan rivers, streams and water-
courses, stormwater channels and the sub-
division of lands within the metropolis as
regards drainage and the size of allotments.
With these powers handed over and a gen-
eral Tramway Trust appointed, the wooden
arrangement opines there would be no need
for a Greater Melbourne Council. In a
word, it recommends a Greater Board of
Shirks, or, which would amount to the same
thing, a Board of Greater Shirks.

“Pat O’Maori” : Aoki, Jap Government
agent now in Sydney, told the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald that his countrymen had all the
elbow-room they could require in Korea and
Manchuria, and would never want Australia.
He also observed that Northern Japan is still
very sparsely settled, although there are fine
agricultural and timber areas in that region.
Taken in the bunch, there is very little that
is reassuring in these statements. The
northern part of the country where chrysan-
themums curl —they only curl to perfection in
fairly cold weather —has a rigorous climate,
and the Japs themselves have, through all
the centuries of their occupation, declined to
go and live there. Is it to be accepted as a
reasonable proposition that the people who
didn’t want to use the cold end of their own
territories will make any sort of mad rush
to settle the colder continental lands nearest
to them? A bit of Korea has a reasonably
mild climate, and this, with the island of
Formosa, which is warm, will stand some
exploitation, but the rich, unpeopled, tropi-
cal portions of Australia must call pretty
loudly to a race which, of choice, lives in
paper houses, and still doesn’t want to have
cold feet. The assurances that Japan doesn’t
want Australia have been very numerous,
but the whole-hearted manner in which that
country has dumped its surplus brown hu-
manity around Honolulu (there are already
over 80,000 of the brown men in the Hawaiian
isles) and on the American Pacific slope, and
the way they have swarmed into Mexico. is
full of uneasv suggestion. The Japs, like
most other folks on this planet, want to keep
warm. Northern Australia has a climate to
suit them. It is just there, and nowhere
else, that the danger lies. Everybody wants
to get out of the cold, and there is a tre-
mendous lot of sun extract going to waste
in the Territory. If Fisher would only get
to work putting down the necessary iron-
Raw Products and Finished Gold.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
R.M.S. Mongolia, which sailed to-night, shipped
the following specie: 400 boxes, containing 200,000
sovereigns; three boxes of bar gold, valued at
£15,035 19s. 2d., for Colombo; two boxes of bar
gold, valued at £10,034 13s. 10d., for Calcutta;
two boxes of bar gold, valued at £10,035 10s. 3d.,
for Bombay.— Daily paper.
No more with golden treasure blow the
galleons to Spain;
But northward, past the Spanish coasts, the
liners bear their gain,
Not slowly like the round-flanked ships that
sailed from Mexico,
But smoothly, swiftly week by week the
mighty steamships go;
Each bears its meed of Southern gold in
strong-rooms snugly stowed,
And smokes across the rolling seas upon its
homeward road ;
Yet ev’ry day, as fast it steams by ocean,
strait and sound,
It sights the sailers and the tramps with im-
ports outward bound.
Beyond the dim horizon rim the Land of
Promise waits
With draining vaults, and failing mines, and
open tariff gates;
It is a land of Hope and Trust —well-dow-
ered at its birth,
It looks the Future in the I(OU), and trusts
the Earth;
The good old Earth a bosom has of unfor-
giving rock,
But pick, and drill, and dynamite more gifts
from it will shock;
And if to-day exhausted Ma her bounties
should withhold,
To-morrow we will find a way of getting at
her gold.
The shafts go downwards towards the reef
a thousand feet or two;
But rarely climbs the chimneystack towards
the staring blue ;
The sheep are shorn, the grain is bagged,
and stout importers send
For finished manufactures to the round
world’s foggy end ;
The wool departs, the grain departs, the
treasure of the rocks —
And in return we get a load of cloth and
splendid socks,
Steel rails, straw hats et cetera for all to
pick and choose,
Including nice new foreign pens to write
more I O U’s.
The bullock shuffles towards the coast across
the downs so wide,
For London hungers for his flesh and clamors
for his hide;
The swarming rabbit sheds his pelt and
freezes good and hard,
And meets old bush friend ’possum’s skin in
some exporter’s yard ;
The wool bales trundle to the wharf and
jostle loads of wheat;
The dead flock, veiled in muslin palls, come
slowly down the street;
Lead ingots twinkle in the sun —our pro-
ducts raw behold!
There’s nothing finished here — -except the
strong-room's minted gold!

mongery, it might soon be discovered that
white Australians liked that climate even
better than the Japs, and were prepared to
hold it to the last gasp against Nippon,
Tophet, or the Day of Judgment.
Dry-Fanning and Sundries.
A certain feeling of anxiety concerning
Nielsen, M.L.A., begins to be apparent in
some quarters. Nielsen, who is a member
of the N.S.W. State Labor party, became a
bone of contention a considerable time ago.
Then he dropped out of local affairs. He
went to the United States as a Commissioner
of something that this paper has never accur-
ately ascertained, with an allowance of
£4 4s. per day for expenses; and as a pair
was secured for him the Government was
just as strong without him as it would have
been with him. If his expenses were calcu-
lated for six days in the week they repre-
sented £25 4s. a week. If they ran for the
whole seven days they stood for £29 Bs. per
week. The item being “expenses,” and not
“salary,” Mr. Nielsen was able to retain
his seat in the N.S.W. Assembly and his
Parliamentary remuneration. The wan-
derer returned with a report, concerning the
nature and value of which very little is
known at time of writing, though doubtless
further information will transpire. Now,
after a very brief stay, lie is off to the
United States again, still retaining his
M.L.A.-ship and his Parliamentary status,
and with, it is reported, the same old allow-
ance .of £4 4s. per day for expenses. Plis
first business, if the daily papers are correct,
is to attend a conference on “dry-farming.”
No doubt dry-farming is an interesting and
most valuable subject, and the name of it
was probably invented in the U.S., but the
thing itself belongs to S.A., and there is no
visible pressing need to go to the Uncle
Sam country to study it. S.A. is a State of
380,070 square miles. Of that area 317,600
square miles have less than lOin. of rain per
annum. Another 33,405 square miles have
less than 15in. and a further 14,190 square
miles have less than 20in. Only 14,875
square miles can boast a 20in. fall or more,
and of this the 40in. area only amounts to
64 square miles. Yet S.A. is “the wheat
State.” It has practically no gold, silver
or coal, and very few other metals. It lives
mainly on dry farming, and often manages,
out of its deserts, to dig almost as good a
crop per acre as the mostly well-watered
U.S. does. It really seems hardly worth
while to go all the way across the Pacific on
a dry-farming mission.
Quite recently an exceptionally brilliant
idea occurred to the massive brain of Colonel
Onslow, representative of the Dead (Waver-
ley) in the august Parliament of the Ma
State. Onslow suddenly realised that the
Sydney cars are not equal to their work, and
it was intimated that the hon. member for
Waverley (the Cemetery) “desired to move
the adjournment of the House to discuss a
definite mutter of urgent public importance,
namely. “THE OVERCROWDING OF
TRAMS in the metropolitan area.” Now,
the gallant and honorable member had no
remedy to suggest, and when any tremendous
Hannibal or Caesar or other warrior inter-
rupts the business of the House from 4.57
p.m. till 8 p.m. to affirm that the Sydney
trams are too full of people, he is a weari-
some retailer of stale news, and a thing of
mockery.
Since the Reilly-street drain has been
covered over, the “Flat” turned into
an ornamental park, and the glory of
the old Rokeby push extinguished, Colling-
wood is no longer that Dower which, in old
time, moved Heaven and earth and the ad-
journment of the court in order to secure
extra J’s.P. to deal with the rush of busi-
ness on Monday mornings. But it has not
yet learned to submit meekly and without
protest to that pageant of Bumbledom, the
mayoral ball. It has its Philistines
and its irreconcilables, although they do not
now turn out in force to oppose the blue
uniform of authority with the blue metal of
revolt. Still, they do their best. While
the return ball to the Mayor and
Mayoress was in progress the other
night, and bright the lamps shone o’er fair
factory girls and brave boot-clickers —while
the town clerk hobnobbed with the insoector
of nuisances, and the health officer bowed
right gallantly to his feminine admirers—
tFieves broke in and stole. They were sports
in their way, for they laid hands on a num-
ber of packs of nlaying cards ; and perhaps
they were crusaders of some new sort, for
they embezzled a satin bannerette. A den-
tist was fain to submit, without gas, to the
extraction of his hat and overcoat, and two
councillors were levied upon to make the
trinity of hats complete. If this kind of
thing continues, the council will have to
raise the municipal vote in Collingwood, or
erect a toll-bar at the Victoria-street bridge
(where Laura Swain committed suicide for
love long years ago), and charge an import
duty on the passengers by tram.
The Melbourne divorce reports are not
so amusing, now that a’Beckett is on the
Bench, as they were in the ripe and fruity
days when Madden used to give the co-
respondent beans and the benefit of his
fine old crusted wisdom. But they have
their gleams—mostly supplied by feminine
witnesses. A practical woman, for instance,
was Catherine McClair —and she had a
housewife’s regard for domestic cleanliness.
Giving evidence in the case of Sherlock v.
Sherlock, she said that the respondent, whose

Bernard Shaw’s version of “You Never
Can Tell” differs in certain respects from
that presented at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. On
the night The Bulletin attended it began
with a procession of mumbling silhouettes
and a voice “off” crying passionately, “Well,
I gave them the tickets ! I can’t help it if
they” Then the padded door closed with
a’soft thud, the procession of stumbling sil-
houettes passed by like a heavy-footed dream,
and one caught a glimpse of a young dentist
mumbling something at half a chair. (It
must have been a complete chair, because
various characters sat in it; but only half
of it was visible.) During the evening, vari-
ous incidents of the play happened round
that (presumably unavoidable) corner; but
fortunately Shaw’s plays are available in
book form, so one could sit back and imasrine
them without losing track of the action. The
acoustic properties of the house seem to vary
a good deal, for many speeches were slurred
regrettably. The production, as a whole, is
gently disappointing. Of the nine important
characters, three may be written down as
good. Placed in their order they are: The
Waiter (Edward Rigby), Mrs. Clandon
(Caroline Bayley), and Fergus Cramoton
(E. A. Warburton). The others fail to
satisfy. Claude Rains, as Bohun, K.C.,
makes a truly heroic effort to convey the
prescribed impression of “absolute tremen-
dousness.’” Unfortunately, he isn’t stout and
tall, and does not possess “a powerful menac-
ing voice.” The result is that his supposedly
overawed listeners apphar to be merely a
number of indulgent people who are foolishly
allowing a small, passionate man the luxury
of bullying them. Norman Page, as Philip
Clandon, suffers from his long stretch as the
Cat in the “Blue Bird.” There is just a
perilous hint of the doleful mee-yow now
and then, and some of his gestures are almost
paw-strokes. Some of the tricks he used in
his “Blue Bird” role of Sugar have stuck to
G. Dickson-Kenwin, the Finch McComas of
the production. Madge Mclntosh scores
quietly but not brilliantly as Gloria, and
Gladys Ellam is a little old-maidish as the
(allegedly) irrepressible Dolly Clandon.
Ewan Brook makes a sprightly, undistin-
guished Valentine. A distinctly average
production. And with Shaw’s stuff to work
on, no production should be rated as low as
“average.”
“THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR,"
AT SYDNEY ROYAL. ”
The host of - The Garter (Arthur Trantom) and
his unprofitable guest Falstaff (Oscar Ascht).
The main excuse for the usual big crowd
going to West’s Svdney pictures this week
was “The Earl and the Girl,” or “Eva,” a
drama in two reels. The heir to the Earl-
dom is in love with a girl much below his
rank, and things look as though there might
soon be a knot to tie. However, the old
Earl dies, and in his will expresses the hope
that his heir will not marry beneath him.
Wherefore he looks for a new sweetheart,
and about 100 ft. later finds one. The wed-
ding is arranged, but the ex-sweetheart puts
in an appearance, and creates a disturbance.
She also turns up at the subsequent dance,
where she has “a stroke,” and dies. Alter
that, the Earl and his girl live happily, etc.
On September 7, West’s will go back to the
Glaciarium for the summer season.
The great practical chokes at the Adelplii
have become chestnuts, and must soon go
the way of all chestnuts. However, the
villain is standing the strain well, and seems
confident that he can last out a while
longer. The new piece is already announced
as “The Forbidden Marriage,” which sounds
as though the villain will no sooner have got
over his present choky sensations than he
will have to face the hero in another capa-
city, and perhaps be lynched nine or 10
times.
The pride and chiefest joy of the National

moment, is the Olrac troupe. It is composed

of knockabout acrobats of the highest class.
“Fun in a Drawing Room” is the name of
its sketch, and the writer frankly owns that,
were the proceedings in the reception halls of
the Very Best People as cheerful and exciting
as those in the guest-chamber of the Olracs,
he would make a resolute effort to burst
into society and stay there. No hostess,
anxious to learn how to make her “At
Home” day go, should miss this turn. Vic-
toria Cross (no relation of the lady who
writes the high temperature novels) has
arrived with a collection of Scotch songs,
and Lalie Brooke continues to win the'ap-
plause of the discriminating. On the other
hand, Carrie Moore is leaving. In fact, by
the time these lines see print, she will be
but a fair, melodious speck on the dim
horizon.
The chief virtue nowadays of the bicycle-
trick act is that it makes one feel young
again. Miss Minnie Kaufmann, now show-
ing at Sydney Tivoli, puts the calendar back
to 1890 or so, for a few sweetly reminiscent
minutes, and almost persuades the onlooker
that the old portraits on the dress-circle
stairs are those of recent headliners. Chinko,
a youthful juggler, represents the other nov-
elty of an unexciting week-end. The remain-
ing upholders of the second part are the
Schenck Brothers, Sprightley Sisters, Stav-
ordale Quintette, Rich and Rich, Jessie
Stuart and Fred Bluett.
J. Rufus Wallingford shows no signs of
being tired of getting rich quick at the
Criterion; and many a local company pro-
moter leaves the theatre nightly a wiser and
a less honest man.
** ❖ *
Allan Doone’s parting shot was a revival
of “A Romance in Ireland” at the Palace.
Although this particular romance is alleged
to be Irish, it is just the same, as the 50 or
so other romances that wander into Sydney
every year, being mainly about a pretty
girl, a lover, a wicked rival and a handy
way of getting the lover out of the way,
until the last act, of course, when he turns
up and wins on points. A few things stand
out prominently: (1) The acting and stag-
ing are just the same as when the piece was
put on at the Adelphi, which means that the
actors are quite satisfied with themselves.
(Some of them are easily satisfied.) (2)
Edna Keeley continually forgets that she is
Irish, and not American. (3) The “Irish”
widow also forgets rather frequently that she
is Irish, and at times speaks as though she
never knew. (4) What humor there is is
all cut and dried —very much dried. On
Saturday “The Girl from Wavback” (Philip
Lytton’s co.) will make her debut.
“The Merry Wives of Windsor” will
harass their bloated admirer for but eight
nights more, so far as Sydney is concerned
After to-morrow (Friday) week, the vast
buck-basket will depart from the Royal, and
the property snow, which is really salt, will
be bagged, and one of the most diverting of
shows will get a move on.
Music-loving citizens flocked numerously
to the Melbourne Town Barn on Saturday
night, when Mrs. Kirkby Lunn made her
first bow (a somewhat unusual bow, by the
way) to an Australian audience. With her
opening number, the “Softly Awakes Mv
Heart” aria from “Samson and Delilah,"
the large lady caused her auditors to sit up
and take notice, and throughout the evening
she emphasised her possession of many
artistic qualities which some recent con-
traltos emphatically have lacked. Each of
her numbers was attractively given, and the
melodious proceedings were brought to a
close with an exquisite rendering of Hullah’s
“Three Fishers.” Mrs. Lunn owns a con-
tralto which is singularly smooth and round;
displaying a masculine tendency in the more
profound passages, but with mezzo notes of
sweet and caressing quality. She throws
the pearl of her voice into the wine of song,
and it melts into melody. Her artistic re-
sults appear to be achieved almost without
effort, and her admirable intonation is free
from jagged ends and rough edges. Andrew
Shanks is a baritone who takes life and his
voice seriously. His enunciation is not
faultless, and his art is not sufficiently ab-
sorbing to cause one to forget his calamitous
cognomen; but his little bit, including the
prologue from “Pagliacci” and Elgar’s “Pipes
of Pan,” was well done. Andre de Ribau-
pierre, an interesting violinist, was especially
successful with a selection from Saint-Saens';
and pianist William Murdoch, unluckily pro-
grammed to commence with a long-distance
selection from Bach, when the audience was
impatient for the star, won respect, if not
absolute affection.
This description of the latest Marlow-
drama, at Melb. Princess’s, lacks the more
amazing details which unfit «uch horrors for
BROUGHT TO RUIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Baby was a stuffed one,
Its outside limp and clean ;
But Oh! the author of its shame
Was wondrous neat and mean —
A toff, who ceased to love mania
When Baby came between.
A ruiner of maidens pure,
Hight Philip Edge, was he,
Likewise a learned barrister
And popular M.P.
He longed for Jessie, and did lure
Her from a launderee.
Her sailor lover dangers dared
To rescue Jessie dear,
And in the den where she was shared
Tom Bowline did appear.
Alack! a coffee-colored Turk
Stabbed Bowline from the rear.
Perdition seized that silent Turk
Who wrought this deed of ill!
A fiend accursed sent to work
The drama’s wicked will,
Whose name looms large in ll—l, but is
Not mentioned on the bill.
Poor Jessie rocked a cradle in
A room at Philip’s flat;
Her bogus Baby slept within,
As all alone she sat
Reflecting on the social sin
Whereby it was begat.
Despite the solemn oath he swore
To wed whom he’d betrayed
(When Thomas Bowline came once more
To weeping Jessie’s aid),
The traitor thrust her from his door,
And still unmarried stayed.
She wandered forth, a girl forlorn,
With Baby at her breast;
That bogus bundle, basely born,
She tenderly caressed.
The laundry ladies sniffed with scorn
At Jessie, sore distressed.
Then gloomy Philip put a price
On Baby’s empty head ;
A washerwoman, stained with vice,
Came in with stealthy tread,
And killed the Baby once or twice,
And left it very dead.
Poor Jessie, babeless and distraught,
Was seized and hurried thence,
And tried for murder, which she thought
Was truly her offence.
But sailor Bowline came and sought
To prove her in-no-cence.
And with the help of parties known
As Comedy Relief —
A drunken hag, a giddy Joan,
A gay and sprightly-thief—
The guilty ones were overthrown,
And vice was brought to grief.
The murderess, for crime inept,
Was hanged from gallows tree ;
Grim Philip bowed his head, and crept
Home moodily to tea,
And no one for the Baby wept
Except the Bard —that’s me.

discussion in prose. To talk seriously of
these sordid, money-making shows is to
unpack one’s soul with swear words, and
waste a lot of honest indignation. “Brought
to Ruin” is just a riot of ugly absurdities
and demoralising acts of violence, some of
which are funny enough. Miss Mortyne is
condemned to play the wash-tub virago, who
belts people with crowbars, and spifflicates
the Baby. Miss Guildford is the cast-off
Mistress, who bleeds the bad men and
smashes their belongings. Miss Mabel Rus-
sell is the bright little piece of orlright, who

loves a pickpocket, and pushes him into the
vegetable-barrow business. Miss Clavering
gives a rough presentment of Mrs. Slug on
the eternal “tank.” John Forde is Deacon
Skinner, converted into a bagnio proprietor;
and Miss Linden is the tall lady, who robs
a “lamb” of his portable property at the
Bower of Bliss aforesaid. The hero and the
learned barrister, who hovers around the
laundry looking for “victims,” are quite re-
spectably acted. Miss Irby Marshall plays
Baby’s mother with good accent and discre-
tion, and if the shocking entertainment
achieves an enormous success, she can be
pleaded as an extenuating circumstance.
At the Bijou, a hopeful management is
persevering with the drama of the
Dop Doctor who sat up all night
with the water-bottle and was cured.
If the Doc were less immoderately plump,
and the lady whom he adores at a distance
were less amateurish and inanimate on the
stage, and many other circumstances hap-
pened differently, the odds against “The
Fighting Chance” might shorten to five to
one. At present they are 50 to one, offered

Alexander Watson, the lean elocutionist of
the blessed memory and the voice that never
grows tired, will complete his Melbourne
farewell season, at the Athenaeum Hall, with
a Macbeth matinfie, on Saturday. Two
nights at Bendigo, next week, will see him
through his tour. Had he so desired, Wat-
son could have attained to music-hall notor-
iety as Alexander the Great, the Possessor of
the Most Astounding Memory in Two Hemi-
spheres. However, he looked round for
another world to conquer, and, instead of
devoting his. talents to supplying antagonistic
inquirers with the date of the execution of
Queen Elizabeth and the precise moment at
which the time first commenced to grow ripe,
he decided to turn his memory into a storage
tank for much of what is best in Shakspeare
and other melodramatic writers. His
Dickens recitals are notably first-rate. In
fact, most of the work that Watson does is
first-rate, or nearly so, and, next time he
comes this way, he will be confronted by the
figure of Fame blowing a trumpet on the
wharf.

drop dead right there in his boots, or
expire tediously to slow music, after breath-
ing a last fond message for mother? The
advt. should smile. The missiles never reach
the heart of the. Magician. He catches them
as easily as a civil servant catches the influ-
enza, and returns them hot to their owners,

The Royal (Melbourne) will break its
three weeks’ silence next Saturday (31st),
with the “Ben Hur” production that stag-
gered Sydney and made the citizens feel
somewhat Biblical a while ago. “Ben Hur”
had a past in Sydney, when it was revived
after many years, but this will be Mel-
bourne’s first experience oL Jerusalem and
Antioch and the Chariot Race.
Alec Hurley, who transpired at the Opera
House on Saturday, is not unknown to these
parts. He was out here in the long ago with
the bounding and bounteous Marie Lloyd.
His merit as a “coster impersonator” is
best indicated by a bunch of negatives. His
make-up is not outrageous, his voice is not
unbearable, and liis general deportment is
not over the artistic odds; also, his songs
are not bad specimens of their class. His
ditty anent the ’ard life of the cove who
wields a pick and shovel goes right home to
the ’eart of every day-laborer or loafer in the
audience. Aubrey Mallalieu, aided and
abetted by a. couple of she-performers (one
of whom plays a slavey modelled on a well-
known Rose Musgrove creation), presents a
sketch which would be better than it is if it
was as good towards the finish as it is at
the beginning. Nella Webb is still decorat-
ing the bill, and La Freya, the Rallis and
Wilson trio, and T. Dawson supply a long-
felt want or something of the kind.
“The Black Chancellor,” tried at West’s
Melbourne house on Saturday night, proved
to be a pictorial hash of “The Prisoner of
Zenda” and its many imitators. The chief
figure in the yarn is the gloomy chancellor
who mishandles a princess and tries to effect
his ends by the crude use of poison and
procrastination. A police item, lumbered
with thrilling events, was programmed as
“The Eye That Never Sleeps”; and there
was a tale of a fat dipso, and his burlesque
crime. West, who shows a business-like
passion for obituary films, also unrolled a
snapshot of the late General Booth review-
ing liis forces. The subject was interesting
as a display of the Sal. Army’s strength, and
the procession of peoples before the aged
Booth seemed like a rehearsal of the Last
Judgment.

featuring a bandit, a sheriff, some thirst and
a desert.

under abnormal conditions, and the backbone
of th e. country will be almost doubled up

“ THE FIGHTING
CHANCE,"
AT MEL-
BOURNE
BIJOU.
The Dop Doctor (John Cosgrove) proposes
midst shot and shell.
It may not be very widely known that
Adelaide, where tbe culture grows, lived up
to its reputation quite a while ago by becom-
ing possessed of the first Shakspeare theatre
in Australia. It is still going strong. Pro-
prietress and manageress is Mrs. Powis-
Stuart, who was once on the stage
in Sydney and Melbourne as Miss Vir-
ginia Vivienne. Most of Adelaide society
(Adelaide society is all cultured) haunts the
Shakspeare Theatre on show nights, and
nothing has ever happened there to cause the
Immortal Bard to turn in his grave. In
fact, his ghost has frequently been observed
hanging round in a state of great applause.
❖ >!:
Things theatrical have been quiet in Ade-
laide. At the Royal, the Bert Bailey co.
has ranged from “Bonnie Mary” (with bed-
room scene) to a revival of “The Squatter’s
Daughter,” with the author-comedian himself
getting most of the “fat” situations. The
Tivoli has Alberto Marini, the Quinlan
opera’s tenor, and some brilliant juggling by
Hera. At the King’s are Romanoff, Alf
Chester, and other clever people, mostly
musical. Among the pictures, the Empire
stars the very, very old “His Natural
Life,” and West’s “War and the Girl,”
while Wondergraph has a remarkable
Italian-acted version of Dante’s “Inferno.”
The more, lurid incidents are wisely toned
down a bit; in fact,. Hades is not as warm
as it might be, but it is an infernally good
Sheol, and devilish clever. Many people
think a darned lot of it, and say it is so
dashed like Gehenna that nobody could tell
the difference.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Oscar Asche’s threatened revival of “Antony
and Cleopatra” recalls the fact that the last Aus-
tralian production of Shakspeare’s Roman-Egyptian
play was disastrous. (By the way, the tragedy can
hardly be called a revival as regards these parts.
It has not been done in Melbourne since 1889, or in
Sydney since 1882.) “Tony and Cleo.” was the
Moscow of George C. Miln’s Shakspearian campaign
at Melbourne Opera House. The salaries, including
those of Miln, who was an ex-parson, and his wife
(Louise Jordan) amounted to £334 per week. He,
as Antony, drew £3O per week, and Cleopatra
drew £l5. Receipts for a four-weeks’ run were
a little over £2OOO, and the old Roman voluptuary
was driven into the insolvency court.
Alexander Watson’s second recital of “The Mer-
chant of Venice,” at the Athenaeum Hall, was sorely
disturbed by a lady with a cough. Her bronchitis
made so much noise that it disconcerted Watson, and
stopped his flow of memory for a moment; after
which he seemed in imminent danger of a break-
down every time the dame uttered her chest com-
plaint. And all the trouble was due, apparently, to
the sufferer’s lack of clothing. Her bodice was cut
low all the way round, and every breath of breeze
that played upon her cough-box made her a nuisance
to the audience in general.
“Screen”: The flickergram of the marriage of
Viola Tree, Beerbohm’s daughter, shows a cheerful
affair, conducted in a church of a high social order.
Asquith is there, and is so much like Beerbolim that
it is difficult to say which actor is in the foreground.
Viola is nearly 6ft. long—a sort of Clara Butt in
general dimensions—and towers over her husband,
more emphatically even than Mary over George.
Some years ago the lately-wedded dame was thrust
into the part of Ariel in “The Tempest,” and floun-
dered through the dainty role like the winged soul
of a female elephant. Which reminds me of huge
Alice Barnett, as the Fairy Queen, in “lolanthe”
the lady who talked about using a buttercup for a
hammock or something of the sort.
“Harrison O.”: A new Theatres Bill has been
brought forward by thp Watt Government, and is to
be thrown as a sop to active piety. Its chief clauses
promise pains and penalties to any and every person
who runs entertainments in opposition to the shows
which the Wowser sets up on Sunday, Christmas Day
and Dull Friday. There has been, in Melbourne, for
some time, a growing demand for a rational Sunday,
and, in the suburbs, the proprietors of picture shows
have been making some sort of attempt to mitigate
the gloom which hangs like a pall over the place on
one day in seven. Of course, at the first hint of
opposition, the voice of Chadband was loud in the
land, and Willy Watt, Victoria’s pseudo-strong man,
hastened to appease his anger. A body of Socialists,
who have been accustomed to hold Sunday evening
meetings at the Bijou Theatre, will be prevented
from doing so under the new law; but there is
nothing to prevent any parson or lay preacher deliv-
ering a political address from the pulpit on the
viciousness of Compulsory Military Training, or the
iniquity of the Alien Immigration Act. Also, there is
nothing to prevent a parson getting hold of a charred
brand, snatched from the burning in Fiji or some-
where,. and putting it up to talk and sing its native
gibberish, this being a type of nig’ger minstrel show
which is very popular with the godly. The Act also
treads heavily on the. showman who opens his place
on Good Friday. This brand of showman has been
pleasingly numerous of late;. Rickards’s people hav-
ing set the good example by holding a matinge and
an evening performance. In future their perform-
ance will have to be draped with the garments of
hypocrisy, and sicklied o’er with the pale cast of
cant. Possibly a new “first part” will be put on,
for this occasion only, called “The Foolish Virgins,”
or something of the sort.
The cable recorded the death, last week, of Marion
Hood, an operatic artist over whom our fathers were
wont to blither in the days that are dead. She came
here with the Nellie Farren-Fred Leslie company, and
made good in leading r6les without a moment’s de-
lav. She had a fine and well-trained soprano in
addition to good looks and charm.
London Reffrfe tells a story of Will Bishop, an
Englishman, who has been putting in a long engage-
ment at a Berlin theatre. After three years of danc-
ing hard for seven nights a week, he felt run down,
and put himself into the hands of a local doctor.
The doc. examined him thoroughly (but apparently
asked no questions), and then delivered the verdict
that he must take more exercise! This recalls the
eighteenth century doctor who told a new patient,
suffering from intense melancholy, to “see Grimaldi,
the clown. He’ll make you laugh.” “I am Grim-
aldi,” said the miserable one; and then he col-
lapsed, and wept bitterly. He could make every-
body laugh save himself.
“ THE FIGHTING
CHANCE," AT
MELBOURNE
BIJOU.
The turning of the worm ! According to a Berlin
paper, the Fatherland’s actors and musicians are
agitating for the examination and licensing of all
persons who undertake the job of dramatic and
musical critic. It is suggested that, before being
granted a certificate of competency, candidates
should be compelled to show (inter alia) : (1) That
they are educationally qualified; (2) that they pos-
sess expert knowledge of stage business; and (3)
that no personal animus or vindictiveness has ever
tinged their criticisms. The prospective victims
scoff that they’ve no objections if, as a natural
corollary, mummers, musicians, composers and
dramatists are similarly “passed” before being
allowed to present themselves professionally for
criticism.
Oscar Hammerstein, the New York Jew who, at a
cost of a quarter of a million, put up a new and
gorgeous opera house in London, has now publicly
confessed that he has made a m,stake, or a miscalcu-
lation, or something of that sort, and has come a
cropper. His second season closed on the night of
July 13, and, after the final fall of the curtain, he
made a jerky, discursive speech on the situation. He
admitted a loss of ±145,000 during his brief career
of seven months as a London operatic manager.
Also, he had mortgaged the building for £40,000.
“Any other man would have chucked up the enter-
prise.” He was alone in the venture. Not
another man had a solitary penny in it.
What was he to do? Turn that magnificent opera
house into a variety theatre? Well, not yet, any-
how. He meant to give opera a third trial, and
would start a new season in November. He believed
that a love for grand opera must be inherited, and
that was why the Governments of Continefital coun-
tries built and subsidised opera houses. Why did not
the British Government or the London County Coun-
cil go and do in a like manner? “Because,” said a
voice in the gallery, “we have quite enough taxes
already,’’ a reply that made Hammerstein halt and
the audience grin. In spite of Hammerstein’s
prophecy that he will risk a third operatic season in
November, there is a good deal of scepticism in
London. It is generally believed that he will think
better of it in the meantime, and accept the offer of
one of the music-hall syndicates to take the white
elenbant off his hands.
“0.K.”: The foolishness of the professing broad-
minded critic who tries to “hedge” on the question of
the Anti-Grundy drama, is exemplified in a recent
notice of “Mrs. Warren’s Profession,” in a London
paper. Said the “hedger”: “I have never regarded
this notorious play as teaching anything but the
sternest morality, but I am —-shall I say?—old-
fashioned enough to believe that it deals with a
subject better not discussed before a mixed assembly
of playgoers, numbering, perhaps, many young
people, whose ignorance should be enlightened, not
in the theatre, but in the home.” Which is almost
worthy of the immortal Mr. Podsnap, who considered
that the ignorance of the female “young person” was
a sacred Podsnapian trust. The subject and the
moral of Bernard Shaw’s play never is taught in
the home of anyone who objects to Mrs. Warren on the
stage—a fact which the author had in mind when
he wrote the drama. And as for the idea of her
being unfitted to appear before a “mixed audience,”
it is the same old argument that has sterilised the
teaching of Wowser clerics, and killed public dis-
cussion of the Contagious Diseases Act, and would
prevent, if it could, the utterance of medical lectures
to mixed audiences at the University. A dramatist
who is told that he ought not to preach the “sternest
morality” to maiden ignorance may well ask
whether the average musical comedy is a proper
entertainment for a girl to take her uncle to.
Chung Ling Soo, the Chinese Court Magician,
whose real name is Robinson (fancy a- Chinaman
named Robinson!), is now conjuring .at London
Hippodrome. He has also been advertising himself by
giving a Lilly Buck-stleet banquet to the journalists
and artists, thereby getting a good column in the
evening papers, and a useful par. in the morning
ones. Birds’-nest-soup, shredded bamboo, Chow dog,
stewed chicken with seaweed, shark’s fin, sea slugs,
Mongolian mushrooms, and various other delicacies,
were served up with more or less success. One of
the journalistic diners says they all “had to struggle
with their chop-sticks, and, while some succeeded in
reaching their mouths, the majority only succeeded in
staining their waistcoats.” In an old Volume of the
Colonial Monthly, a Melbourne magazine of the
’7o’s, there is a capital article by Marcus Clarke on
a Saturday night dinner in a Chinese restaurant in
Little Bourke-street.
(Continued on page 30.)
The management of Melbourne’s Infec-
tious Diseases Hospital, situated somewhere
beyond the suburban radius, has been dragged
into the limelight to account for a paintully
humorous series of mis-sfatertientS re a small
boy patient who died of diphtheria. The lad
had acquired his disease at Footscray, and
was ordered by the doctor to seek scientific
curative treatment at the Infectious. A
few hours after his .admission the little
chap died. His body was removed to the
hospital morgue, where it lay for a week—
forgotten, more or less. He had not long
been dead when somebody at the Hospital
rang up the West Footscray police station
asking that a certain hotelkeeper should be
requested to advise the corpse’s father and
brothers of their bereavement. The message
was not fully understood by the licensed vic-
tualler in question, consequently the rela-
tives got no word of their loss from him.
The boy continued to be dead in the morgue.
Nobody called to see him, visitors not being
allowed in the sick wards, but his relatives
made inquiries about him at the Hospital
lodge, and were told that the patient was
progressing, or still improving, or getting
along nicely. If friends of the family ’phoned
to the Hospital for news of the boy, a voice
from afar off invariably replied that he was
making steady progress, or words to the
same effect. Nevertheless, the late patient
continued to be,dead in the morgue. Finally,
when he had become too dead to remain un-
buried, one of his brothers learned, “from
an unknown man in the street,” that the
Hospital wanted to tell him something. Thus
the truth came out. The Hospital regretted
to mention the decease, six hours after ad-
mission, of the patient who had been reported
as “getting along nicely” six days later.
Everybody who has rung up a hospital for
information—public or private hospital—
is familiar with the stereotyped reply. It
is invariably a favorable report of the
patient’s progress, as long as the patient
remains alive. All the same, the Melbourne
Infectious Diseases Hospital is considered to
have gone a bit over the odds in crediting
a patient with improving health for six or
seven consecutive days after his decease.
In the once popular opera of “Paul Jones,”
the father of the anxious heroine used to
assure her that her lover was “dead and
doing well,” but a hospital is not a theatre,
nor do the friends of the patients go there
for comic-opera dialogue. Inasmuch as the
latest scandal at the Infectious has called
forth numerous revelations of other alleged
scandals, Premier Watt has promised a
Government inquiry into the working of this
somewhat mysterious institution. Mean-
while, a broad line of distinction has been
drawn at the telephone between patients liv-
ing and patients dead. It is no longer possi-
ble to learn that your aunt, who breathed
her last yesterday, is expected to sit up and
take a little nourishmepit to-morrow.

BALLER GIRI: “Don't you think it shocking to look up Chidley, the nature man?"
CHORUS GIRL: “Well, dear, it all depends. You see, he was infringing on our right."
“It’s dogged as does it,” says an old saw,
but what it is that dogged does the, saw
neglects to state. Consider this instance.
Last year a Tenterfield (N.S.W.) .carrier
was sued in the District Court for £5O. He
squared his jaw and fought the case
doggedly, and the verdict was for £2 only,
with costs. This made him wild, and he
became so dogged that nothing could hold
him. He went to the Full Court with the
plea that the £2 verdict simply couldn t
carry costs, and the Full Court hounded him
off the premises, with more costs. lnen
he became absolutely bulldoggy, and went
to the High Court; and all he got was a
third pyramid of costs. “It’s dogged as does
it,” sure enough, but it would often be much
cheaper if dogged didn’t #
“Goanna”: The Melbourne public cannot
understand why motor-cabs do not ply tor
hire on the streets, in the same way as the
derelict vehicles which still make irregular
expeditions to Carlton and Richmond, and
like places. The City Council has framed an
elaborate code of 81 by-laws for the guidance
of drivers, telling them what to do about start-
ing and stopping, how to deal politely with
diseased, unclean or blithered passengers , also
all about lost luggage, and where to take it,
forbidding the driver to carry a coffin or a
huge tin trunk, or a small wooden box, or a
poodle dog. The table of fares throws some
light on whv there are no taxi-cabs on the
Melbourne streets. By time the rate is bs.
for the first hour, and Is. 6d. for each addi-
tional 15 minutes ; by distance, one mile toi-
ls., and 3d. for every extra 15 minutes.
Back fares, when returning, are bd. a mile
additional, and for detention, 3d. for three
minutes. The owners of the big garages say
these rates won’t pay them, so they won t
put their motor-cabs on the stands.

Dr. Armstrong, Sydney’s Health Officer,
last week broke the glad news to it that it
was getting more fogs nowadays, on account
of the great congestion habit and the conse-
quent multiplication of chimneys. The dry
Australian air can carry a big cargo ot
smoke and dust particles; but the congestion
system is getting it down at last. Sydney
and Melbourne are literally large blots on
the immense, lonely coastline which stares
blankly back at the morning sun. And at-
mospheric blots are conducive to lots ot
things, including chest complaints, head-
aches, train slashes, elopements, broken
appointments, burglary, ferry collisions and
general chaos. It’s a relief, anyhow, to hnd
something being made in the country. We
at least manufacture our own fog.
TWO POINTS OF VIEW.
BROWN'S WIFE: “What a dear little cove!"
BROWN (who has no idea of the picturesque): “ Now , I wonder what she can see in mat
little rat. She never called me a dear little cove.”
“Eden”: As an instance of the kind of
thing which may happen in a place which
is supposed to have no drinks to mix, a re-
cent occurrence at Invercargill (Maoriland )
will test your credulity to the limit, iwo
inmates of the local hospital were to buried
the same day. One, a person of Orange en-
thusiasms, had died in the comfort which
comes of having cash to leave behind. Ihe
other, an ex-patriot of the island where
potatoes and shamrocks intertwine to the
glorv of Dan O’Connell and the hope ot
Home Rule, had to be buried at the expense
of the State. The hospital porter, in his
hurry to get through a gruesome job, put
the Orangeman in the cheap, black casket
intended for the cadaver whose name had
been Rat, and the contract undertaker
hurried it away to the cemetery. The ornate
and privately purchased shell was .failed with
the only corpse left, and the Orangeman
might have gone to his long rest with a
priest’s tender blessing, if a sorrowing
friend of like yellow persuasion hadn t been
filled with a desire to have a last look ad
the face of the departed. One glance sufficed
to raise horrible suspicions and loud clamor.
Fierce inquiries were set on foot, and at tfae
last moment the dead exchanged pillows and
were buried in a manner befitting then-
respective creeds and their cash value at the
moment of extinction.

“Vic ” • Prime Minister Fisher, with his
idea of a National Portrait Gallery, begins
at the wrong end. His gallery is supposed
to represent the founders of the Common-
wealth, among other things. It is to con-
sist mostly of Governors and nonentities.
Some of them hardly look big enough to
deserve a place even now, when they are
still on deck or just newly gone below. They
will be almost forgotten before their portraits
are dry, and quite forgotten by the next
generation, and the generation &fter will
throw them into the dust-lieap. The wise
old Roman Church makes a saint wait 40U
years for the head-hoop or brain-pan blazon.
If he or she stands four centuries of inspec-
tion, then the case seems fairly good, lhus
Joan of Arc has just been appointed to the
honorable company of the elect. A live
mayor may look bigger than a dead Solon,
but he doesn’t last so long. Therefore, when
a feverish Prime Minister starts giving 1250
each for portraits of the twopenny celebrities
of the moment he is establishing a system
which, if it is maintained, will end m Aus-
tralia having about 100,000 portraits, 99,500
of which will be of no account, while the
500 will be overwhelmed and obliterated, by
the innumerable cataract of painted tripe,
and no one wall go to look at them.
Recently the Children’s Home at Remuera,
near Auckland (M.L.), advertised for Protes-
tant married couple, wife for cooking, husband
for handy man, no children, wages £2 ss.
per week.” The poor old unfortunate kid
is apparently not wanted anywhere. The
object of the blessed home is to protect
infant life, yet unless the handy. man has
murdered or abandoned his own infant, he
can’t get a job in it.
“Henry Horsecollar” : Three items of in-
terest happened in the Sydney papers last
Monday. One concerned the disappearance
of Thomas Podge, of Ashfield. The apparent
impossibility of being named Podge sticks
out conspicuously. Another was a cable
about the shooting, somewhere m Bel-
gian Africa, of an American elephant-
poacher, or an American with a
poached elephant on toast concealed about
him. And the third dealt with a fight be-
tween two Italian sailors on a ship in oycl-
ney harbor, one doing battle with a razor
and the other with a sledge-hammer. It re-
calls the ancient, unpublished but quite
authentic story of the Middle Ages which
I have just invented, about a duel between
a cleric of great tonnage and a layman ot
small poundage. The one was armed with
all the thunders, of the Church, and the other
with a hatpin. The layman won. Ihis
tale has been handed down in the family tor
centuries, or it would have been if the
family hadn’t died out very early through
the inherited habit of having no children.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Liberal party had to stand against a foe

what no Tory or Conservative Government would
have dared to do. — C. C. Salmon, at Liberal rally.
We ’old no truck with them Democrats, the scum o’

A passel of impiddent forward lads as sossy an’ bold
as brass,
Wot’s always full o’ their “wage-disputes ’ an talk

A-elumpin’ round with their ’ob-nailed boots where
Hangels is scared to tread !
(“Mangels,” o’ course, it refers to IIus) for when,
I would beg to ax,
Did We go in for this Bonus fuss, Defence, or a
Lan’lord Tax?
Ho, well you know as we don’t do such it s more
■nor our souls could bear ;
We don’t go in for Revolt —(not much!) the Party
As Dassn’t Dare!
There's Halfred D, —’e’s a walkin’ “Don’t” —our

’E’ll argue hup an’ ’e’ll argue down, ’e’ll wave of ’is

’E’ll burble o-rations roun’ an’ roun’, by the foot,

[! u i —’e never descends from ’is talk to acts ( cos

With a cautious mien as is halmost Scotch, with a
helegant graceful air,
'E sits with the crowd (on the Fence) to watch

An’ (after all) it’s the best, young man, for the
Country (an’ llus as well)
To let things slide on’the “Don’t Do” plan instead

As Halfred says (in his soft sing-song, an’ ’is mild

“If you don’t do nought, w’y you can’t go wrong,
an’ so you are Halways right.
’Don’t go a-buttin’ agin the Fates, for really it’s

We originally introduced Crepe as a Material for ready-made Shirts
some years ago.
Since then Crepe Shirts have grown enormously in popular favor,
because of their great suitability for every-day wear.
Soft in texture—yet hard wearing—light, cool and comfortable, and
summer-like in character, they represent the embodiment of summer
shirt perfection.
The colorings and designs this season are entirely new.
We make them up in two forms i
No. I—Soft fronts, stiff linen neck-bands and cuffs, 5/6 each.
No. 2—-Turn-back cuffs, improved soft collar, with two button-holes
and loop. White grounds, colored stripes, also in White, Fawn,
Slate and Green ; 5/6 each .
Collar Supporters, in Gilt Metal 1/6 each.

Except at high nooi , Flinders-lane, Mel-
bourne, where the softgoods warehouses
huddle together, is a. shadowed stone trench
of commerce. Very agreeable on a hot day,
it is fearfully cramped and unpleasantly
warm for the Fire Brigade, on the rare and
awful occasions when flames jump and roar
like devils from the roof and windows of
some great chiffon shrine. One of the great
advantages of the narrow thoroughfare is that
the sun, that old-established bush incendiary,
gets less chance to glare through a stray
bit of glass and start a fire, as it did at the
Law Courts, last week. There a table, on
which a bottle was standing, suddenly pro-
ceeded to smoulder and blaze, thereby inter-
rupting the sittings of the Licenses Reduction
Board. The same accident, in a Flinders-
lane softgoods palace, might have cost any-
thing in thousands. “Pull down the blinds
when leaving” ought to be inscribed on the
yardstick of every young draper. Any advice
about bottles would, of cburse, be an insult
to such a well-drilled class. Yet a bottle,
placed at the correct angle, is a marvellous
burning glass.
PROPHETIC.
“Let me see, I'll catch a car .”
Victoria possesses a Board of Public Health
—whose usefulness is so restricted that it
might almost as well be non-existent; also,
the State Government has at different times
issued a number of Health regulations, con-
cerning the destruction by fire of infected
dwellings, etc.- —which, also, might as well
never have been made. A few years ago
the Macedon (Vic.) Consumptive Sana-
torium was closed by the Government; its
few patients were transferred to Greenvale,
and the buildings condemned. The then
Health Minister ordered their destruction,
but for some reason the order wasn’t carried
out. The other day the present Health
Minister Edgar happened up that way and
saw a quantity of galvanised iron, doors,
windows and variegated timber lying about
promiscuous. The iron may still be infec-
tious, or it may not, but the woodwork —
much of it papered, painted or kalsomined —
is rotten with the disease germs from a
thousand dead and gone consumptives, and
should have been burnt long ago. Doubt-
less Edgar knows this, but he is of a thrifty
nature, so he has ordered the debris to be
carted down to the city and thence out to
Greenvale, there to be manipulated into fur-
ther sheds for fresh consumptives. If a
private citizen committed such an unwhole-
some jest, the Law would speedily order him
to burn the ramshackle remnants, and would
fine him into the bargain—the charge might
quite conceivably be constructive man-
slaughter—but apparently a Minister is
allowed to do as he thinks fit, and is privi-
leged to break the very laws he has sworn
to administer fairly and without favor.

“Briner”: The crux is in manning the
Australian navy. Forty raw bluejackets
marched out of Williamstown depot on
August 17, and made for the little torpedo-
boat Childers, at the wharf. Ten of these
men saw the ocean for the first time a
month ago. Nine others had only been a
few trips. down the bay. Seven had just
been outside the heads. The remaining 14
were sailors. Included were four farm
hands, a bricklayer, a coal-miner, several
laborers, a railway porter, a Garrison Artil-
lery gunner, two clerks and sundry trades-
men. Reminds me of a little trouble in a
storm between Sydney and Melbourne. Says
the skipper to a green hand : “I say, matey,
what are you?” “Well, I’m a cabman.” The
40 tars got safe aboard the Childers, and
voyaged to the Encounter, in Corio Bay,-
Geelong. Her complement of recruits is 150.
Mostly joined since July 1. All Australian
naval recruits. enlisted are between 18 and
25. Seamen sign on for either five or seven
years; stokers for 12. The outfit handed by
Government to each man costs £9 2s. 6d.
Pay much more liberal than English. Dietary
scale also, and really tiptop, even extending
to roast pork. So round up the bushmen.
A bushman is half a Tar, even if he has not
seen the ocean.
* * * *
“Salt”: One of the most nerve-wracking
jobs on record is that of skipper of a nigger-
manned mail boat running between Austra-
lian and Asiatic ports.
The ordinary perils of
the sea are increased by
the typhoon season and
the dangers of Torres
Strait* Also the har-
assed “old man” is al-
ways liable to hear that
the. Chow firenlen have
knifed an engineer, or
that a first-class lady
passenger has developed
small-pox, or that the
Chinese seamen have
started a faction fight.
When port is reached
the ship is turned inside
out for opium, and if
any of the stuff is found
injurious hints are
dropped that the skip-
per is in the know. Next
comes the hunt for stow-
aways. Whenever the
Customs haul an evil-
smelling, half-dead coolie
from the ventilator or
out of the boiler the
skipper is fined £lOO.
One luckless individual
was recently fined about
£2OOO. It means that
the ship has to pay and
that the skipper gets the
sack. Finally, there is
the danger of some of
his alien crew desert-
ing in port, and again it is £lOO per
time. Take it for all in all, I would liefer
be a coasting skipper in the humble firewood
trade, with Barranjoey first stop, than the
haughty gold-laced commander of certain
Chow mail ships I know.
* * * *
“Brass Button” :
I note (B. 8./8/T2) that in future the Cunard
floating townships are to carry a “staff captain,’’
who will be required to boss 1 the boat drills and
similar jobs. It is a well-meant reform, but the
real necessity is a “staff” for the new officer to cap-
tain. If he has to undertake the job of training
stewards, chefs and firemen (who on the Titanic and
other liners were, and are, expected to handle the
oars, and skipper the boats unless a lady passenger
is there to relieve them), he has my sympathy.
Many of the black squad, after one round trip,
occupying about 10 Jays at sea, quit the ship to
make a round trip of the pubs till their pay is
swamped, and conclude the jamboree by shipping in
the first available stokehold, so the “staff captain”
is going to have a busy time teaching the fresh
batches of stokers on each trip , that they must not
pull out the boat's plug when at sea to let the water
run off, and that hoisting a sail has nothing to do
with being three sheets in the wind. But if the
Cunard staff educational efforts are likely
to bring his grey hairs in sorrow to Davy Jones,
what price a staff captain’s “pidgin” on.some of the
lines that carry coons as hash-, plate- and coal-
slingers ? Even the best of seamen are apt to be
hampered in the job of lowering a boat in a bad
sea when they are being climbed all over and
trodden on by a panicky mass of discolored food-
dishers and furnace-feeders, whose firm and unalter-
able motto is: “Women and children first —on the
watery way to Jehannum.” About the best scheme,
in such circumstances, would be for all coon-crew
liners to be fitted with nigger-tight bulkheads, so
that in cases of collision, etc., the doors could be
promptly shut until the women and children had
been stowed in the boats and safely launched.

The Religious Editor : At moment of
writing, winter is dozing, those yelling
hounds, the south and west winds, are
asleep below the horizon, and the weeping
angel called rain has gone off duty. Also,
the sea is like a blue Persian kitten instead
of a drunken old man, and the sun, instead
of hurrying across the sky wrapped in a dirty
dressing-gown of clouds, appears daily and
urges men and flowers to hold up their
heads. So my heart is filled with gladness,
At least it was until this morning, when I
met the suburb’s weather prophet ambling
morosely towards the tramline. It was a
fair, fresh morning and the birds were twit-
tering merrily of spring on the telephone
wires we use merely for cursing and lying
purposes.. But the grudging Plaster of hopes
cocked his eye at a few innocent wisps of
shredded cloud to the north and said, “That
means wind!” Then he squinted evilly at
wo e olly U tSts D
SU
the long-drawn, damp sighs of the wind, the
patter of rain on the window, the sword-like
flicker of forked lightning and the rumble of
heavenly rain tanks bursting. I got on the
tram with a brow creased with care and a
heart of lead. The light seemed to have gone
out of the sky, and the dry, happy telephone
sparrows appeared to be twittering lies. It’s
a great mistake to meet a weather pessimist
in the morning.

There is- a crying need for some of the
professors of Melbourne University to at-
tend their own classes on logic. In asking
Premier Watt recently for a grant to enable
the Council to establish a chair of sociology
some learned members of that body an-
nounced their intention to import a profes-
sor from England, as usual; and in order to
get the “best” man they proposed to give
him a life tenure. Then, in • order to im-
press the value of the institution as a teach-
ing academy, one of them mentioned that
Melbourne Uni. students are now holding
professorships at Oxford, Cairo, Edinburgh,
London and Adelaide. Just so! But none
holds any such position at Melbourne.
“Wang”: The Sabbath Mecca of thirsty
Melbourne is Brighton Beach. The police
call there sometimes on the Day of Rest, and
occasionally lead captive a sinful vessel con-
taining an overplus of beer. The Brighton
lock-up is about two miles from the beach,
and as a portion of the journey must be
made by a train which on Sundays is very
seldom on hand when required, the hop-
ballasted person has a good chance of being
sober by the time he is gathered to the police
station. To bring any sort of charge against
him then looks like a violation of law and
equity. It is like accusing a parson of using
bad language an hour after he has read the
Athanasiau Creed.
NOTHING TO DEFEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A deputation, representing the Melbourne Trades
Hall Council, complained to the Minister of Defence
that cadets were compelled to give up part of their
Saturday afternoons to drill. Mr. M. Strahan said
it was a question whether they had anything to de-
fend, and whether it was worth while stopping an
invasion.
Grandfather fought the nominee,
And father fought the Tory crowd.
They struck to make Australia free
Through long hard years, and l-ived to see
The ranks of Pluto thinned and cowed.
A nation rising fair and proud.
But here must Austral progress end—
Our boys have nothing to defend !
The sun is shining in the sky,
The teeming earth is wide below;
The good that money cannot buy
Is free to all, and wide and high
Ambition soars, for here we know.
Each man for truth may strike his blow.
But to (the mire, let hope descend—
' Our boys have nothing to defend !
Cast down 'the. rifle on Dad’s grave,
Heed not the drum’s insistent tap.
The white descendant of the brave
May live to be a coolie’s slave,
Ur have a sweeter, nobler hap
As body-servant to the Jap.
This chance the envious, worms commend,
Our boys have nothing to defend !
The brave at least have this dear right
To make their country what they will;
’Tis worth full many a bloody fight
To keep this wide Australia wljite.
Let triflers sport by vale and hill,
The lilting bugle calls to drill!
Meanwhile, and to the .steadfast. end,
From babbling fools our boys defend.
VICTORIA.

A ballot has been taken in Soutli AuS-
tralia to select Liberal Union candidates
for the next Senate election. Josiali
Symon, one of the present sitting mem-
bers in the Senate, refused to sign the
Liberal platform, and he was, for that
reason, not included in the list of candi-
dates, and, of course, was not selected
by the party.

Is there anything in the uniform of
the cadets likely to attract? Every
mother likes to see her boys looking
smart and well dressed. VV ith hei sex
sense of the “becoming." it must often
cause her a pang to see her lad set out
for drill in his approved uniform.

“Lakekamu”: Re “S.S.S.” (B. 4/4/’l2)
and the “ornate arrows” of the Kuku-Kuku, the
brown people who inhabit the country around the
Lakekamu, near the German border of Papua. To
begin with, the arrows are not “ornate.” They are
just the ordinary sort of weapon the natives of the
western part of the Territory use to kill game—and
man. The yam about the “little black dogs, different
from any others in Papua”’ is incorrect. I have
seen the animals and can say that they are the same
sort of barks usually found amongst natives in
Papua. As to “no white man, and few natives,
having seen them” (the K.-K. folk), I can mention
the names of several men who have seen them. The
prospectors, Pryke and Crow, had one of their
carriers (a Papuan) killed by them. Later on Prank
Pryke, himself, was unfortunate enough to be shot
through the body by an arrow fired by a Kuku-Kuku,
and he saw the man who wounded him quite clearly.
Patrols have not only entered the Kuku-Kuku vil-
lages, but have be.en quite close to many of the
people, who welcomed them most profusely with a
flight of arrows. The Kuku-Kuku have a peculiar
habit of keeping away from the coastal people, with
whom they have always been at war, and they treat
the miners and other strangers who visit their
country with the same “coolness,” but they can
be hardly called a mystery. Anything that is flesh
and blood can scarcely be mysterious; and the
Kuku-Kuku is not more mysterious than the other
inhabitants of Papua. He is certainly a lighter-
skinned person than his cousin on the coast, but he
is not nearly so much advanced, for he is still
ignorant of steel, and depends on stone adzes for the
procuring of food and for gardening, while he uses
the bow and arrow as his artillery. He clothes him-
self in “tapa cloth,” and petticoats of banana fibre,
or I should say his women wear the latter, and he
finds his way through the bush at night by the use
of torches made of bamboo leaves and gum. As a
decoration, he makes a necklace from the teeth and
bones of his enemies, completing his adornment with
the dried hand of a relative, usually a wife or
sister. He is fond of pretty leaves and flowers, and
plants more ornamental shrubs and crotons around
his village, and he keeps parrots and other birds as
pets.
“Eddyson”: Major was a quiet man, a
passable husband, and a good-enough father in the
estimation of all Waddy, till that time when Pope,
amateur evangelist and old-time Wowser in general,
came to take on the invidious billet of searcher at
the Hand and Band- Under instructions from Pope,
the whole township presently discovered that Major
was a drunkard, a profane wretch, and a centre of
ungodliness. During three long months Sam could
not get comfortably drunk without having Thomas
John Pope yapping at his heels. He stood it with
the dull patience of the large, slow-witted man.
Then came the revolution. It was a Saturday after-
noon. Sam Major appeared in Emslie’s bav with a
small man in his right hand. The small man was
Thomas John Pope. Thomas John was pale, for the
fear of Satan was in his heart. Major pushed the
smaller man’s chin against the counter, and, said
he: “Mr. Elmslie, Tommy Pope wants a stiff whisky.”
Pope made as if to protest, and Major jammed him
down, and gagged him with the counter. “Drink!”
said Samuel in the voice of Fate, and Thomas John
drank. “Mr. Pope’s greatly upset,” said Major, “he
thinks he’ll have another.” Thomas John took the
second meekly. “My shout,” said Sam. “Mr Pope
will have a whisky.” Heaven knows what threats
had been piled upon Pope, or what moral compulsion
was at work, but the self-appointed regenerator of
Waddy took everything thgt was coming to him, and
Major held the searcher with his chin to the bar, till
he was as full as he could safely hold; and then
dropped him, and for two hours Pope squatted in
the corner of Elmslie’s bar, and chanted boosy ditties,
while the curious peered in at the door, and bewailed
the good man’s relapse from goodness and soft drink-
ing. At sundown Major took Pope up by the scruff of
the neck, and steered him home, rocking through the
township, roaring and raising Cain. Now and again
he would drop Pope in a puddle, or hang him on a
fence for public inspection, and all Waddy turned
out to witness the passing of Thomas John, and to
deplore the shameful event. Eventually, Major held
his victim by the collar at Pope’s own door. Mrs.
Pope came forth, and Sam allowed the temperance
evangel to crumple up in a spineless pile at her
feet. “Your husband, ma’am,” said Major. “He
was in no fit state to take care of himself, so I
have brought him home.” Then Sam Major went his
way, with the old look of ox-like calm in his eyes.
* * * *
“Walgaroo”: There are many species of
wallaby and plain ’roo, but the one that inhabits the
tops of the trees in the Lakekamu Valley, in Papua,
is the strangest of the lot. I do not know if he
is peculiar to Papua, but he is darned peculiar, any-
how. The beast is very much like the ordinary
ground-living animal, but has much thicker fur of a
deeper brown color, and its legs are shorter. The
ears are very pointed and small, almost hidden by
the thick fur; and the fore-paws are very similar
to a ’possum’s, having long, sharp nails attached
to them, for hanging on to the trees when climbing.
The legs or hind paws have a very soft cushion from
the toes, almost up to the loins, on the under side.
It is very like the pad on the paws of a cat, but
much larger. This is, I expect, what the animal
uses to sit on when resting amongst the limbs, and
as a sitting place it is very nicely padded indeed. I
opine that he sits on it because, if he doesn’t sit on
that part of himself, I can’t imagine what part of
himself he sits on. The tail of the brute is short and
very thick, and covered with thick fur. I suppose
it is the animal usually called a “tree-climbing

kangaroo”? The man that obtained the skins I saw
told me that the late owners thereof were very hard
to see amongst the leaves. He got his brace by sitting
very still amongst the ferns until they came down for
a feed, when he rose up and collected them. He reck-
oned they were new animals, and had named them
New Guinea Bears!
* * * *
“Bulrush”: “Vagabond” (B. 1/8/T2) asks
for a remedy for the “creeping sand” of Raglan
(Maoriland), which threatens to destroy the coastal
pasture land. Well, here’s the medicine. Port Fairy
(Western Victoria) was some years ago in a similar
plight. The coast thereabouts is bordered for several
miles by restless sand dunes, which at one time had
obvious designs on the town and valuable surround-
ing country. The late 0. Pryor, curator of the local
greenery, suggested marram grass. The little clumps
of this hardy vegetable at once took possession, and
in a few months the sands were completely subdued.
I think the grass originally came from South America,
but Port Fairy can now supply to order.
AN OBVIOUS IMMIGRANT.
THE GREAT ONE (at the third beer): “ What, sir! You have not seen me act? Good
God, sir! Might I ask at what hour your boat arrived?”
The business of protecting the fur seal in
the islands of the Far South has baffled Maoriland
Governments in the past, and still continues to
worry them when they can get their, minds off the
latest lOD and think about it. Last year there
were plenty of seals at the
Shares; now, they have almost
all gone. The inference is, of
course, that some immoral per-
son has been making a valuable
and illegal haul. Owing to the
market price of his overcoat,
the fur seal has great difficulty
in keeping up his end of the
terrestrial log. He lives in re-
mote places, which Government
steamers only visit about once
or twice a year. Anybody is
free to go to the Southern is-
lands,. and practically anybody
who does go there finds himself
alone with a bunch of • seals
who carry a lot of money about
with them. What more natural
than that the visitor should
fall before the temptation, and
take the cash away to some
place where it will buy motor-
cars, and the delight of Susie’s
smile, and other desirable
things which are not found at
the Snares, Auckland and Anti-
podes Islands? A common game
is to charter a ketch, establish
a depot for collecting penguin
oil, slay, all fur seals within
reach, and be found extracting
the fatty juices of wingless fowl
when anybody happens along
who looks like a plain-clothes
policeman. Short of sending a
gunboat to cruise around each
rock and islet every morning, there appears to be
no way of separating the poacher from his prey.
“Larrikin”: Donkey-teams are great insti-
tutions in W.A., and in many ways they beat bul-
locks, camels, horses or mules out of sight. They
feed cheerfully on scrub and bushes, and don’t stray
at all. The teamster carries iron pins about 2 feet
6 inches long, with eyeholes in the top. He puts
them out from the tail of his waggon in a semi-
circle towards the shafts —which forms a safe yard,
as a donkey never tries to get over anything. If he can’t
crawl under he gives it best and stays where he is.
During a late wool season in W, A. o-n the Ashburton
River, owing to a couple of willy-willies having kept
the river running till near shearing time, the usual
crossing had about 2ft. 6in. of water and was about
a chain wide. After a few teams loaded with wool
had been through it was boggy, and the horses and
mules balked as soon as they felt the waggons drag.
Someone suggested donkeys, and 27 of ’em were
hitched on in front. They were the salvation of
that teamster, for they were as staunch as rocks,
they went into the chains more steadily than any
bullock team, and they pulled all together like
clockwork!
Julius Deye : The time-worn adage, “too
slow to catch wornis,” is knocked completely end-
ways by a species of sand worm which frequents the
seashore round Tweed Heads (N.S.W.). The crea-
ture is of a pinky hue. It varies in length from one
to three feet, and is armed with a pair of nippers
similar to those which adorn the business end of a
centipede. It is much sought by anglers on account
of its magnetic influence upon whiting, but to the
average fisherman it is easier to catch the whiting
than the worm. A piece of beef or shellfish held
above his abode will cause him to shoot forth his
head from the sand and fasten on the bait. Then is,
the critical moment. The index finger and thumb
should be closed firmly on the inch of worm exposed,
and then the other 30 inches can soon be brought to
light. But that worm is quicker in getting away
than a Freetrader is in grabbing the benefits of Pro-
tection. His rapidity is amazing, but the most curi-
ous part of the business is that all efforts to locate
him in, the sand are useless. I have dug a hole
36in. x 18in. x 18in. within 30sec. of missing his
wormship, and found no trace. He is the original
and only genuine mystery.

THE COLLAPSE OF HELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Salvation Army Commissioner Hay, in the course
of an address delivered in Sydney recently, said: “You
can never tell when the bottom is going to fall out
of some of the Devil’s contrivances.’’
Through the subterranean vastness of incalculable
space,
’Neath the griddery where lost souls used to fry,
I beheld a wild, disordered and unprecedented race,
Heard the clamor, and the devils’ hue and cry.
They were queer, assorted legions that had pleasured
and were Lost,
And they bore the sign of sorrow for their sins ;
For through the Flames of Torment by Nick’s pitch-
fork they’d been tost,
And reflected in their eyes were Satan’s grins.
There was brimstone in their whiskers; there was
sulphur in their hair;
There was bubbling lead a-dripping from their
ears;
On their cracked and shrivelled lips I heard the
splutter of despair,
Aye, and steaming in their eyes were boiling tears.
The murderer who stained his bands while living up
on earth
With the heart-blood of his over-frequent wives,
And the Hun who plucked Love’s roses for his
sordid, selfish mirth,
Were hurrying downward, downward for their
lives.
The parson and the publican, the poet and the priest,
With the Wowser, and the spieler, and—good Lor’ !
The very man of all the men I loved on earth the
least—
A scorched and scurrying city editor !
But I saw the chance I’d longed for. “Steady now,”
I said. “We’re quits ;
For the Devil on your spirit-broth shall sup:
You shall squeal and squirm and frizzle on Gehenna’s
hissing spits”—
And then, flashing out my foot, 1 tripped him up.
Then his Tailed and One-Hoofed Highness quickly
grabbed him by the heels,
As he pierced him with his fiery-fingered fork.
“Ho! ho!” I said. “Just hold him, and I’ll phono-
graph his squeals ;
I’ll photograph his editorial pork!
That he should dare escape his doom, it angers me to
think—
Hell’s fiercest pain is lesser than his due!
And I’d now suggest you boil him in a pot of
printer’s ink,
And impale him on a pencil burning blue.”
The Path of Good Intentions faded out long leagues
behind ;
Not a warder of the Blazes seemed to hear;
Gone were all the flames that used to lick the sub-
terrestrial wind;
And on every face there shone a strange new fear.
Aye, but still the swift procession of the souls who
were not Saved
Came scurrying down—with eVer more on top!
And whimpered each: “Gehenna’s flames we grimly
would have braved ;
But now it seems we’re never going to stop!”
And his Highness, right before me, let the editor go
free,
While still the scampering legions downward sped.
“Pray explain your indecision, oh, my Barb-Tailed
Majesty—-
Why has this soul gained his liberty?” I said.
Then he gave this explanation: “Oh ! my sulphurated
heart!—
It is breaking through its thick asbestos shell;
That editor and I, alas ! for evermore must part—
For the bottom’s gone and fallen out of Hell ”

“Wal”: The lot of the man who pene-
trates the interior of Papua is a hard one, but the
man who essays an ascent of the larger rivers in the
Western Division 1 of the Possession strikes some-
thing out of the common in the way of adventure.
On the Bamu River there is an enormous tide that
comes in all of a heap, and the same phenomenon is
to be seen on the Fly. When the tide flows in and
out of these streams it does the business in quick
time, generally arriving at the rate of knots, and
causing a wave that can deal out sudden death and
destruction to both man and vessel. At Howling
Point, on the Fly, the “bore” is a truly terrifying
thing to witness. One moment my boat was aground
and lying on its side. The next it was afloat with its
head to a rushing torrent. The “bore” can be heard
coming when it is a couple of miles away, for it
kicks up an awful row, the noise sounding like the
drone of bagpipes or the roll of drums. Its pace is
about 20 miles an hour, and the ridge of water is
from a foot to six feet in height, according to the
phase of the moon. The Bamu River “bore” is the
worse of the two, and has reaped a big harvest of
natives, who have been caught when out in their
canoes. The mouth of the Bamu is blocked by a big
island that splits the tide into two, and the meeting
of the streams raises a wave that is sometimes quite
10 feet high. And when 10 feet of water is doing
20 miles an hour, it is time to drag your maiden
aunt out of the way in haste.
“J. P. Aitch”: During a recent pilgrim-
age through part of the Territory, I happened on a
bachelors’ camp, and was invited to dine. It was
a well-appointed place; but the half-yearly supplies
had arrived per waggon the previous day, and the
cook, as is the custom, had taken a day off to put
hops in his hair. His staff of two lubras was in-
structed to do his work of cooking and waiting. I
didn’t see the cook ; but one who waited would
have made the fortune of a city tea-room. She was
attired in one sleeveless garment; her ebony arms
glittered with bracelets, fashioned out of preserved
milk-tins; and her pearly teeth gripped a full-size
man’s pipe, which she kept in full blast right
through the meal. She didn’t cheek us once or give
us the frozen eye like the usual city duchess-in-
waiting, but just puffed away like a motor-car out
of order, And straggled in and out with the food
in a happy, savage fashion. Have met much less
agreeable food-bringers than My Lubra Nicotine of
the Territory.
“Yarra Yarra” : On the subject of croco-
diles being found inland. I am scribbling this 200
miles south from Burketown (Q.). On several occa-
sions I have seen the ugly brutes in the river
(O’Shanassy), near the house. They are from two to
three feet long. There is a five-footer in Camooweal
—got there some years ago. The local people say
there are larger ones. But then local people always
do.
THE MINOR OFFENDER.
SEXTON: “ Here, get up! You've been here

DRUNK (ferociously): “Long enough! Met
Why don't you rouse the bloke next door.

“E.W.0.”: A Chow shambhed along to
Lake Cowal station to look at a ringbarking job.
After he had looked round, the boss asked him his
price per acre. The puzzled alien shook his head
and murmured: “No savee. How much dozen you
give?” Ah Cabbage, true to his market garden
training, had evidently counted the number of tall
vegetables, and done a deep Mongolian calculation as
to the number of stalks he could cut between dawn
and dusk.

GRESSION'.

“Tea Tree Bill”: Re “Vagabond’s” re-
marks (B. l/8/’l2), concerning the “creeping sand”
at Raglan (Maoriland), why not try marram grass?
It thrives strongly in sea sand, and the more sand,
and the more shifty the nature of the sand, the better
it grows. It is very jealous, or bashful, for if any
other grass is planted with it it gives up the ghost,
or eats its heart out with grief, or
something—anyhow, it vanishes. Near
Cape Otway (Vic.) there is a planta-
tion of it, and at stated times the
vegetables are deposited among the
sand dunes. The modus operandi is
for one man to shove a stick a foot
or so into the surface, and then an-
other puts in the herb, which some-
what resembles four or five sticks of
sword grass, and stamps the drift
around it. The grasses are set out
in rows about a foot apart. In a
very short space of time the sand
banks up, and, the more it banks, the
more the grass works overtime. It
is consumed with a laudable ambi-
tion to get to the top, and it gets
there. At last the nuisance makes up
its mind that it is no good leading
a whirling, giddy existence any more,
and settles down to a steady, respect-
able life as a solid bank, crowned
with the useful foliage. Some of the
stems must go down 20 or 30 feet.
It is remarkable that, in places where
once the sand hummocks shifted so
much, that one day trees and telegraph poles were
almost buried, and on another were clear of sand,
large, solid fortifications have been formed which
stay all further encroachments.
* * * *
“Pick” : Re the mystery of shifting beach
sand (B. l/8/’l2), the coastal Binghi declares that,
where seaside stone is removed inland, the sand
invariably follows. Near Bermagui, N.S.W., some
stone was taken from near the sea, for road-making.
The oldest inhabitant of the Wallaga blacks’ camp,
warned the quarrymen that the sand would follow
the stone. His prophecy was cheerfully disregarded ;
in fact, the ancient was recommended to get work.
To-day, a trail of sand is gradually tonguing its
way towards the stone embankment, and the “tole-
yer-sos” of the discolored vaticinator are rapidly
infuriating the entire district.
“Eddyson” : This is a traveller’s tale. He
has something to do with somebody’s celebrated har-
vester, that cleans the crop, bags the wheat, stacks
the straw, washes up, feeds the calves, and puts the
children to bed, and he gets about a lot in the
wastes and the strange .places. He had small
acquaintance with Martin, Martin’s being the last
place between Horsham and the Limit where you
could expect to get a drink. Martin was the usual,
long, lean man with unkempt whiskers, who never
laces his boots. He had a bloated dog and a bald
cockatoo with talons, lived in a bleached, gaping
weatherboard skillion in the Drear Expanse, and
seemed to sustain life on splinters off the rail
fence. When the traveller first called, Martin was
alone. Next time there was a woman on the brow
of the hill, yelling after a calf that had swallowed
two-thirds of a shirt. On the third occasion, the
woman was cleaning Martin’s windows. On the
fourth, the woman was sitting on Martin’s step.
Martin was found later, lurking in the saplings at
the crossing, and made anxious inquiries bearing on
the exact whereabouts of the woman. When the
traveller passed again, it was Martin the woman
was chasing along the brow of the hill, with no
visible excuse or reason. Then there was a lull.
The traveller did not reach Martin’s holding again
for five months. When he did, he was some time
locating Martin. The man on the land was up a
tree, and the nameless female was sitting at the
foot of the gum, unarmed, and wearing an expression
of amiable resignation. “Why, what’s wrong?”
inquired the traveller. “Nothing wrong,” answered
the woman gently. “No n£ed to raise, your voice.
The man in the tree thinks He’s not going to marry
me. I think he is. That’s all.”

A statement loudly applauded at the con-
ference of the Maoriland Farmers’ Union, was to the
effect that the real salvation of the Maori race
would begin when every member thereof had to
work for his living. Considering that the remark
was made anent the proposal to get what is left of
the Maori land for white settlement, the joy of the
delegates is easy to understand. Long ago the Maori
used to work like a Trojan to get his dinner in a
country not particularly well provided with edibles.
Later, he found that his hunting grounds were gone,
and that among his conquerors the noblest and
most honored were those who did little work, or
shirked it altogether. He sat down to lead the life
of an aristocrat, and in some districts succeeded i-n
levying a tribute on the Pakeha, and running motor-
cars. To tell him, at this time of day, to get
work, shows the painful failure of the Farmers’ Union
to grasp the situation. No white man works, except
to secure enough to enable him to stop working.
Why should a brown man unlearn all the beautiful
lessons he has gained by close observation ? By
taking to toil he may achieve salvation, but by sit-
ting still he may become a big landlord. The farmers
themselves are solid for the freehold principle!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I know the breeze has tarried
To fan your bronzed hair ;
I know, because it carried
The fragrance it found there.
The garden buds are drooping,
They hear your light step fall,
The pampas reeds are stooping
In answer to your call.
This white magnolia blowing
Is rounded like your breast,
One spot of crimson glowing
Where my hot lips have prest.
The leaves are all a-tremble,
On high the white stars shine;
We heed no more dissemble,
This glad hour makes you mine!

The Bayonet: Is It Worth While?
“Miles” opens fire :
I note with grief, -not unmingled with surprise,
that The Bulletin's “Old Soldier” has been applaud-
ing Senator Pearce's action in omitting to have the
Commonwealth troops taught the use of the bayonet.
Says he; “In how many recorded instances have
infantry successfully charged with the bayonet during
the past 40 years? They could be counted on the
fingers of one hand.” I can supply the number of
occasions stipulated for by your aged warrior from
the records of the Russo-Japanese war alone. Per-
pend. (1) At the battle of Kinchow, on May 26,
1904, the First Division, after a fight lasting from
9.10 a.m. till 7 p.m., finally drove back the Russians
with the bayonet and occupied Nanshan. (2) At
the battle of Liaoyang, on August 26, 1904, in the
attack on Toyoda Tama, the highest point and the
key to the Russian position, bayonet fighting oc-
curred. The first charge was successfully delivered
by the 46th Regiment (3rd Battalion) at 1.20 a.m.
(3) At the battle of the Shaho, on October 13, in
the attack of the Okayaki Brigade on Lan-Tung Shan,
a bayonet charge was delivered, and, as a result of
it, the Russian troops were driven from their posi-
tion. (4) During the defence of Pen Hsi-Hu, by the
Japanese, at the battle of the Shaho, the Russians re-
peatedly charged with the bayonet. The Shibu Bat-
talion was charged no less than six times in succes-
sion. This assault failed, but only on account of the
Japanese being themselves armed with the bayonet,
and knowing how to use it. (5) In night fighting
the bayonet was used at Ohuruyama, in a counter
attack by the Guards’ Division, and a fierce struggle
ensued, both sides losing heavily.
From the period of Waterloo—when Napoleon’s
retreating forces suffered such damage from their
bayonet-armed pursuers—it has been an axiom of
warfare that the value of the bayonet—more especi-
ally in night-fighting—is enormous. As a matter of
fact, provided the enemy’s troops are not of very
inferior quality, it is not possible to settle the issue
of an engagement by means of fire effect alone. The
final decisive struggle must depend upon the armo
blanche.
It is true, as the “Old Soldier” remarks, that
bayonets weren’t used much in the S’African war,
but the fact proves nothing. In that unpleasantness
the British were engaging a guerilla foe, who declined
to wait for close-quarter fighting. Also, according
to the highest military authorities, both British and
foreign, the British officers showed a lamentable lack
of knowledge as to the proper time to. bring the
bayonet into play, right through the campaign.
One of the greatest problems of modern warfare
is the carriage of ammunition to the firing line. The
fellow in the trench, for his part, won’t be content
to sit down and wait till his attackers come in with
the bayonet, but if a favorable opportunity occurs,
will come out and meet them with the steel, and en-
deavor to drive them back. Suppose our men are
not armed with the bayonet, has the “Old Soldier”
ever stopped to think what will be their fate when
they get to close quarters with an enemy who is so
armed? In return for a bayonet thrust they will
only be in a position to supply a prod in the ribs
with the muzzle of a rifle, which will be about as
effective, in the circumstances, as a smart blow with
a parasol. The only thing that can shift a well-
entrenched enemy is the cold steel or the fear of it;
and if the defence authorities don’t both provide
Australia’s defenders with the bayonet and teach
them how to use it, they will be making the error
of their lives.
“Barroid” : I’m getting a bit sick of The
Bulletin's ceaseless reflections on the cow-cocky’s
intellect. As a matter of fact, thousands of these
honest fellows are fairly bursting with brain. By
way of proving my words, I ask, in common fair-
ness, to be allowed to cite the case of Sam Bovine,
my neighbor. In addition to running a dairy herd
he leases two stallions. The animals are visited by
from 80 to 100 mares per year. When no one is
about, Sam yards the ladies up, and either “bobs”
their tails or pulls the hair out. Last year, as hair
was worth about ss. per lb., he made enough on this
racket alone to stand himself a particularly festive
trip to Sydney.
A NEW OCCUPATION FOR THE
BACKBONE.
In the July issue of The Agricultural Jour-
nal, the Poultry Expert (Mr. D. F. Laurie) ex-
pressed the opinion that the Government would do
well to run an egg-laying competition for farmers
only, and pointed out that the extra expense would
be very small. Mr. Laurie's proposal will meet
with strong support from farmers in all parts of
the State. — S.A. chooky-hen item.

BARLOW , Minister without portfolio in the
Denham Government (Q.).
A line from “Medico”:—
Dr. W. L. Mullen, who recently terminated his
superintendentship 0 f the Ararat (Vie.) asylum (and,
incidentally, the wedded bliss of three weeks , stand-
mg) with a dose of prussic acid, had a somewhat
unusual career. Whilst superintending at Yarra
Bend, some time ago, he himself became mentally
afflmted—-so much so, in fact, that he had to be
forcibly fed, per tube, in the private establishment
where he was incarcerated. He was a barrister as
well as a. doctor, and, although he practised but a
short while in his legal capacity, he had the dis-
tinction of defending Deeming—the gentleman who
planted his frequent spouse beneath the hearth, and
(if he was correctly reported) in some cases hilari-
ously danced over the hallowed spot in the presence
of the buried lady s successor. Mullen put up the
evergreen plea of insanity, but the Law was in an
incredulous mood, and Deeming whirled between
earth and Heaven.
“T. Tufthunter”: I must break a clothes-
prop with the cynical writers (B. 8/8/’l2),
who break out into jingle about the late
Mikado. If these persons really knew that
the late lamented was “the descendant of
Ameno-ninakanuchi-no-Kami, the creator of
the world, the Imperial family being a divine
race,” they might alter their tune. I quite
agree with the Rev. Ebenezer Ditchwater as
to the want of reverence in Australians.
Some people would write disrespectfully of
a State Governor.
“S.T.S.”: I don’t know whether Chidley
is technically insane, but, if not, he ought
to be prosecuted for publishing an indecent
book. Insanity is the only excuse for its
production. The worst of calling a book
“unprintable” is that, if you are telling the
truth, you can’t prove it! But anyone who
has read “The Answer” knows. As soon as
it reached London, T. P. O’Connor de-
nounced it as the work of a “sex pervert,”
and handed it to the police.
The male parent of astronomeress Proctor
was responsible for the dealing of a shrewd
blow to Sabbatarianism in the Ma State.
He was announced to lecture on stars, one
Sunday night, in the Theatre Royal. Parkes
raised the Kiama Ghost, and stopped the lec-
ture, having unearthed an ancient law for
the purpose. The absurdity made all sorts
of mild people get up and fight, and when the
dust had cleared away, sundry dead supersti-
tions were found lying around. The idea
of Parkes as a guardian of the Sabbath was
too vast an absurdity.
An obituary by “Lantana”:—
Henry James Piper has joined the larger multitude
at North Sydney. He was 78 years of age when he
lorded the Jordan. Deceased was the youngest son
of Captain John Piper, R.N., who was a wealthy
landowner and sportsman, and the nearest thing to
a genuine London Mohawk, of the Tom and Jerrv
variety, that Australia ever possessed. He bought
Vaucluse from that cheerful abductionist, Sir
Henry Browne Hayes, and it was afterwards passed
on to William Charles AVentworth. Late in the ’2o’s
of last century, Captain Piper hoofed his way across
the Blue Mountains, and settled at Bathurst, where
many of his descendants live even unto this day. He
died in the odor of revelry, and was buried at Holy
Trinity Church, Kelso.
“Rimu”: Died at Palmerston, Maoriland,
William Fraser, aged 81. Fraser led a fairly
stirring existence in the golden days. He
fought, or heard about somebody fighting, or
looked on, or something, at Eureka Stock-
ade (Victoria) ; crossed to Maoriland and
rocked a cradle at Otago’s earliest rushes;
returned to Victoria, and ricochetted again
to the Shickery Islands. Twenty-three
years ago he looked in at Palmerston, and
elected to stay there as a storekeeper.
I raser had the curious distinction of get-
ting born on the battlefield of Culloden, but
not .while the famous scrap was actually
going on.
Mrs. Mary Baker, who died at Grafton
(N.S.W.) recently at the allegedly reliable
9r years, had 14 children, 10 of whom
are living. All of them are said to be over
70, and with children and grandchildren of
their own. William Baker, of Brookvale, is
understood to be 81 years of age, and has a
large family, the youngest of whom, H.
Baker, of Blue House, Manly, is quoted as
55 years old, and is likewise a grandfather
having a married daughter with a family. So
the old lady was indeed a mother in Israel,
and the birthrate didn’t slump on her
account.
One witness brightened up the weariful
proceedings in the Weedon v. Farthing
(Vic.) disputed election case with an inter-
lude of picturesque speech. He was a pro-
fessional election agent, and, like the girl in
the play, he knew a thing or two. Ques-
t/oned to his sobriety, he admitted he got
slack,” “boozed” or “screwed” at times, but
seldom “soused.” “blind” or “paralytic.” He
had, he said, “a weakness for a jollv, roy-
stering kind of slacker.” “I am ‘ either
thoroughly drunk or thoroughly sober. I
have gone all the way from a Rechabite
lodge to Lara, and know all about it.” Lara
is where the State sends its jim-jams to be
cured. It is the Home of Reformed Snakes.
“Chasuble” : Hold on, there ! Something
under two years ago Gordon Tidy, one of
the Bathurst (N.S.W.) Church of England
clergy, was converted to Roman Catholi-
cism. He went to Rome to do as Rome
does, and studied at the English College.
News presently came that he had been con-
verted back to the Church of England, and
now I hear that our old-young friend ex-
Governor Beauchamp has patronised Tidy
into a tidy living, called Dymock. There
was an English celebrity who was twice con-
verted to Roman Catholicism, and three
times to Protestantism. Whenever outside
he fancied _ the inside best, and vice versa.
Plenty of time before the Bathurst preacher.
He may yet be Abdul Tidy, the Moslem, or
Tidy Abrahams, the Rabbi.
"Q.K.,” about an old gentleman :
A very enfeebled veteran these times is George R.
Ireland, father of Harrie and Daisy (just married),
and sole survivor, probably, of the Australian actors
who figured with G. V. Brooke in the long ago.
Certainly he has the most interesting record of all
the veterans. Melbourne papers, the other week
recorded the death of William Bates, late of the
Old Colonists’ Hornes, as though he had been an
actor of note in his day. They talked of his having
played with Titheradge in the original production of
Silver King.” But Bates was a clerk of petty
sessions up to the “Black Wednesday” period, and
when he took to the stage late in life, he filled onlv
smallest parts. George Ireland entered the
profesh in the 50’s of last century, and held a good
place for many, many years. A Melbourne Royal
programme, dated September 10, 1886, records that
he played the name part in “Othello” for his benefit,
Titheradge being the lago. When Tith. starred as
Hamlet for Ms benefit, at about the same time, G.
R. Ireland was the king. For some 10 years past
this well-rememhered identity has been out of the
game. Things have not gone well with him of late,
and it seems up to society or posterity or some-
body to arrange a benefit for the tali, thin and
eminently respectable old-timer.
Thus ex-Premier Verran (S.A.), in re-
tort on a colleague who qualified his accept-
ance of a disclaimer: “With one hand you
believe us, and with the other you call' us
false.”
“Chasuble” supplies a biography :—-
William Booth was reared in the Anglican Church,
but sickened of its smug buckram. He praught in
the streets of Nottingham for the Wesleyans, and
horrified them by fetching strings of tag-rag and
bobtail into worship. Became a clergyman of that
body, but left because of the mercenary snuffle.
Minister for two years then in the Methodist New
Connexion, which was more democratic. Yet he left
that also, on the ground that the New Connexion
(these good people never spell it “connection” for
fear of Hell-fire) wore its corset too tightly laced
and couldn’t breathe. He married Catherine Mum-
ford, and they had a large small family by this
time. Yet he went forth without any prospects.
Started all by himself on Mile End Waste, London.
William and Catherine Booth had eight children —
three sons (Bramwell, Ballington and Herbert) and
five daughters (Catherine, Emma, Lucy, Eva and
Marion). Bramwell quickly developed calibre as
staff head. Ballington first' did well in charge of
Clapham Training Garrison. Then he commanded in
Australia and in the United States. After nine
years the General had to oust him in a forcible
manner. Ballington, Catherine and Herbert have left
the Army. Emma (Mrs. Tucker) was killed in a
U.S. railway accident. Lucy is Widow Heiberg. Eva
commands in America. However, this is going much
ahead from Booth’s early worrying. From Mile End
he collected followers. His right-hand man in the
so-called Christian mission was T. W. Cameron,
who died in Melbourne only a few weeks ago. Suc-
ceeded by Railton, whose freak was never to wear a
hat. Valuable worker, and founded the cause in
the United States, where he was followed first by
Moore and then Smith. Neither of these satis-
fied the General. Moore tried the first of the abortive
splits. Smith turned to Socialism, always a horror
with Booth, so much helped by the rich. Railton
appears to have invented the name Salvation Army.
Moore’s defection had a great effect on the General
in rousing suspicion of Barker, in Australia. The
Army was first brought to Adelaide in 1882, by
Johnny Gore, known as the Hallelujah Donkey
Rider. He was helped by Tom Gibbs, or “Yorkshire
Relish. Booth had a strong bias towards eccentric-
ity, through capturing tiny Cadman, a chimney-
sweep, pugilist, boozican and police-troubler. Ever
since a valuable officer, and visited Australia. One
lady officer was even known as the One-eyed Prophet-
ess. To open work in Melbourne, Booth selected
Major Jimmy Barker, who had been a larrikin of
Bethnal Green. This gentleman was married to Miss
Sellon, and off they went, per s.s. Cotopaxi. Barker
only had a few pounds in hand. Started on Colling-
wood Flat, January, 1883. Received help from Dr.
Singleton, vvho lent a bit of a wooden shanty. Other-
wise religion and the Government frowned on
Mr. and Mrs. Barker and Happy Dinah, the pioneers.
The first conve:ts were dubbed with odd names,
tickling the public with such as Happy Jack and
the Hallelujah Shoemaker. By far the most important
recruit was McPhee, who has ever since been trea-
surer. Soon there came along Pollard and Wright,
sent by Booth to open in Maoriland, and very suc-
cessful there. Meanwhile, Barker was quite drenched
with money, and hit out. The cause spread like
wildfire to North Melbourne, Prahran, South Mel-
bourne, all round the city, also in Ballarat and
Bendigo. Booth became alarmed, as above • stated.
He sent out Ballington to supersede Barker, in 1884,
with Howard as adviser. Barker turned somewhat
rusty. Difficulties arose over the ownership of the
property already acquired. Barker could have been
nasty if he had liked. Who owns the vast Army
property now? I can never find a satisfactory
answer to that question. Booth wanted Barker to
return to England permanently, and Barker wouldn’t
Ballington had to shunt. After a sort of divided
command between Howard and Barker, the pioneer
returned to obscurity in England. He was, perhaps,
over-sanguine, and might have Ird to insolvency. He
inyented the Social Work, which was only imitated

in London from Melbourne. Howard laid the founda-
tions of the real business, which now yields over 70
per cent, of the income. Well did they calculate the
effervescence of hysteria. Tom Coombs, from Canada,
of desperate energy, followed Howard. In the begin-
ning of 1895 came that astounding coup of buying,
for £19,500, the Melbourne premises of the Young
Men’s Christian Association. They had cost £55,000
of which £29,000 was paid. The place is now worth
about £30,000. The Army’s annual Australian self-
denial fund has reached between £30,000 and
£40,000, without any account being given of what
is done with it. Yet it is palpable that the officers
have no luxury. The highest wage is nominally only
£3 10s. a week, but Commissioner Hay manages a
bigger concern than Archbishop Clarke, at £4O a
week.
Parson Casely, who died suddenly (in the
street) in Adelaide, last Friday, had been
making things as unpleasant as possible
P-Sed Nicholas during the greater part
of his 79 years. He acquired the habit in
Tasmania (Launceston. Franklin and Camp-
belltown) over half a century ago, and then
had 40 years of it in South Aus. He never
snuffled, and was universally popular.

“Quite a gloom,” according to Melbourne
Age, was cast over the Salvation Army
headquarters by the news of the death of
William Booth. Certainly the sound of the
tambourines was not heard, and the shawm
and the sackbut were mute —but the gloom
did not extend to the dying of dags at half-
mast. The Army, with a serene confidence
which pagans might well imitate, does not
mourn in the ordinary way for its departed.
It holds that the believer ought to be glad
to be dead, although it doesn’t subscribe
entirely to the ideas of the late Phil May.
Phil, in describing his funeral as he would
have liked it, detailed the bright bands of
chorus girls who would escort the procession,
the prancing steeds which would draw the
hearse, and the gay music to which they
would keep step. “And then,” said he, “there
would be Me, sitting up in my coffin, smok-
ing a good cigar!” It is not known for cer-
tain whether the Army will smoke a good
cigar, but it will wear a white arm-band for
oU days, and, meanwhile, Bramwell Booth
is trying on the crown.

Gently beat the muffled drum —
Booth has gone to Kingdom Come,
In a box, beneath a pall,
All that was “the General”
Lies embalmed in deathless fame,
Due to one who made a name —
One who very widely scored
As an agent for the Loard.
Parsons’ ways are mostly smooth ;
Hugged was the way of Booth.
Parsons feebly cried their wares —
Sermons soft and formal prayers;
Booth, with hot, unhaloed brow,
Banged his drum and made a row ;
Offered goods that Souls desire.
Labelled neatly, “Blood and Fire.”
The idle, godless, passing crowd
Gave heed unto the trader loud,
And Providence was pleased to bless
The hook-nosed hawker’s bus-i-ness
Till cynics, silencing our mirth,
Admitted his commercial worth —
Who sent forth travellers to sell
Salvation from Eternal Hell.
Muffle your drums, ye Army bands!
Your Chief lies dead in fifty lands.
Silent he lies, in gloomy state,
The Jew Apostle, up to date.

Nominally the reserves are £1,104,785, but it is very
little use paying heed to the alleged reserves dis-
closed by the accounts of a mining company. The
position with regard to this great concern may best
be expressed this way: Besides its mine and various
plants, -it has £645,120 of liquid assets in excess of
its liabilities. The company is now 27 years old.
For the first 18 years it devoted itself exclusively to
the production of silver and lead from its own ores.
Next, it turned its attention also to the zinc in its
sulphide ore. Next, four years or so ago, it began
to bid against European smelters for the output of
other cos. Now, no doubt under the influence of a
conspicuously energetic general-manager, it has de-
cided to become a manufacturer of steel and iron,
drawing the raw metal from its ironstone quarries
34 miles inland from Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.). The
eo., by the way, had a heap of luck with regard to
those quarries. Originally its furnaces were on the
mine, and the ironstone flux was drawn mainly from
the capping of the lode. Subsequently, it was found
less expensive to haul the ore to the seaboard than
coke to the mine, so new works were established at
Port Pirie, mainly because ore could be shifted to
that port without break of gauge transhipment. The
existence of Iron Knob was not known at the time
the shift was decided upon. Subsequent exploration
disclosed, quite handy to the works, one of the
biggest and purest supplies of ironstone in the Com-
monwealth.
Like other people who are in the ore-buying busi-
ness, the B. H. Prop, takes good care not to disclose
the profits made on its contracts. It lumps its
revenue in four heaps: Silver. £229,206; lead.
£637,912; other products, £25,763; interest and
miscellaneous, £19,767. It is not a capital offence
to treat this apportionment as something of a joke.
For instance, the co. produced 46,005 tons of zinc
concentrates, and the proceeds from the sale thereof
are apparently squeezed in somewhere. The smelters
handled 79,846 tons of lead ores and concentrates,
in addition to 6036 tons of flue dust, etc. The
total included 62,006 tons of concentrates and slimes.
The production of concentrates from the co.’s own ore
was just under 26,000 tons. So, apparently, about
36,000 tons of slimes and other co.’s concentrates
went into the smelters. The chances are that more
than half the feed to the smelters consisted of pur-
chased ore and products. But one can’t even guess
how much of the profits was derived from one and
how much from the other. The mine appears to be
regarded chiefly as a standby nowadays. It is worked
one shift only, and the total output last half-year
was 111,285 tons, or about one-third of the output
in the days before the eo. launched out into the
regular ore-buying business.
No estimate is made of the ore in the mine. The
last time one was put forward a dispute was pending
with regard to wages, etc., and the figures were no
doubt cut to the bone. Since then, the section of the
mine in which a fire burned for 12 or 15 years has
been re-opened with very satisfactory results; also,
a moderate-sized ore-body has been found at 1400 ft.
in the extreme south of the mine. It is impossible
for anybody to say how much ore can be got out
of the fire area, but, on a conservative calculation, it
may be safely reckoned that the present output from
the mine could be maintained for 10 years at least.
Still, the mine plays only second fiddle nowadays,
and no estimate of any value can possibly be made
regarding probable profits to be derived from the
more important manufacturing side of the business.
The latter includes not only the handling of other
people’s ores, and the projected manufacture of iron
and steel, but also the distillation of zinc (spelter),
which is still little past the experimental stage in
Australia. Last half-year’s output of the metal was
895 tons, while the total contained in the zinc con-
centrates produced was about 22,000 tons. This
shows how small a proportion of the zinc material is,
so far, turned into metal at the company’s own works ;
the balance continues to be exported. The little
metal that is produced is described as “first class,”
but the management says nothing concerning financial
results, having a large capacity for holding its tongue
regarding things that the public would like to know
about. # *

In the beginning of things at Broken Hill, this and
the adjoining Central mine were owned almost ex-
clusively in Sydney. But Sydney, and especially the
Sydney of 20 years ago, had little idea what to do
with a metal mine when it had one, so the two con-
cerns passed into the hands of Melbourne and Ade-
laide people. For some years neither of the proper-
ties showed up conspicuously, and the South looked
once to be on its last leg i s. That was Just before the
successful treatment of sulphides was evolved ; and in
that matter the South Co. led the field. Almost
every succeeding development has been to the ad-
vantage of the company. Regarded once as the very
poor relation of the B. H. Proprietary, Block 14 and
Block 10 —the three central mines—it is now, so far
as ore bodies are concerned, easily the superior of
all of them. The central mines had their riches
close to the surface; those of the north and south
have got theirs at greater depth. No estimate of
reserves is made at the end of this half-year; six
months ago they amounted to 3,000,000 Tons, in-
cluding only ore above the 1070 ft. level. And
though 165,532 tons have been bitten out of the
mine during the past half-year, it is pretty certain
that considerably more than that has been developed.
Nor is the 1070 ft. the bottom of the mine. At the
1200 ft. level, in the Sulphide Corporation’s Central
mine, which corresponds with 1225 ft. in the South,
tlie ore body 20ft. from the South's boundary is at
least 86ft. wide. Moreover, there is probably a good
deal of ore not taken into account above the 1070 ft.
level. To explore some of it a shaft is now being
sunk close to the southern boundary; also at the
500 ft. level in the Central mine, a western body,
15ft. wide, of good ore, has been met close to the
South’s boundary, and evidently pitching into that
property. In estimating 3,000,000 tons it is pretty
certain then that there is a good deal left to come
and go on.
Now, what is that ore worth? The profit for the
past half-year, as shown above, is £141,639. But
to that might be added £15,000, which has been
transferred to a Concentrates Suspense Account. This
and most other Broken Hill cos. sell their metal to
foreign buyers. They get credit at the prices ruling
at the time of delivery, or thereabouts, but the final
settlement is usually made on the average prices for
the ensuing six months. Thus, to provide for pos-
sible backwardation, this and other prudent com-
panies put something by to a Suspense Account. The
South’s fund now amounts to £35,000, which is re-
presented by bank deposits. Most prices have been
moving up of late, and lead looks as though it
may go still higher, but on past experience there
will be a swing back, and then this fund will have
to be drawn upon largely. It is safer, therefore, to
disregard it. Taking the profits at £141,639 and
the output at 165,532 tons, it will be seen that the
average profit realised liq,s been equal to 17s. Id. per
ton. At that rate 3,000,000 tons would be worth
£2,562,500. The surplus of liquid assets is
£142,440, exclusive of Concentrates Suspense Fund.
Total of the two = £2,704,940. There are, in ad-
dition to the ore, 1,110,000 tons of zinc tailings and
nearly 300,000 tons of slimes. These dumped pro-
ducts are, of course, worth a great deal of money:
but the profit for the past half-year includes some
derived from this source. The plant, or part of it,
will have to be renewed before the mine is worked
out, and this may be taken as a set-off against the
value of the products on hand. There are 200,000
shares in the company ; hence the foregoing calcula-
tion gives a value of £l3 10s. 6d. per share.
But, as before remarked, the erratic metal mar-
kets have stood at a high level during the half-year.
It is safer to go back to the beginning of 1907 ; in
that s|-year period there have been downs as well
as ups. This list shows the basic figures for that
period:—

June, 1912 .. 165,532 ~ 120,000

As at December, 1906, the net liquid assets were
£119,572 ; now the surplus is £142,440. Add the
total of the dividends and the growth of liquid
assets; total, £622,868. That is to say, after pro-
viding for all mining and milling charges, and for
the renewal and necessary extension of plant, the
co. has, in 5J years, made £622,868, which means
Bs. Id. per ton of ore extracted, plus a proportion
of used-up dump tailings. At that rate, the
3,000,000 tons in reserve, aided by stored products,
would be worth £1,212,500, or £6 Is. 3d. per share.
That shows the difference between calculations based
on the profits made during one half-year of high
metal values and the past 51 years, during which
values have been low as well as high. There can be
no question which is the safer basis to operate on.
On top of the 3,000,000 tons there are, of course,
the possibilities of further important developments,
but that is a matter for speculation only.
A great deal depends upon the zinc market. The
South sends all its ore to the lead mill, where it is
divided into silver-lead concentrates, zincy tailings
and quartz tailings, with a small percentage of
slimes. The past half-year’s output worked out as
follows:

The silver-lead concentrates are sold to the smelters ;
the zinc tailings go to the De Bavay 00. ; the quartz
tailings are used for filling depleted stopes, thus
adding to the safety of the mine and reducing the
timber bill; the slimes, the bugbear of metallurgists,
are dumped for future consideration. The De Bavay
people pay 3s. 6d. per ton, then out of the profits
they take 3s. 6d. themselves; the balance of profits,
if any, is divided equally. The Zinc Corporation
pays 3s. lOd. for old tailings. During the half-year
the latter company took 17,585 tons, equal to (say)
£3370. The Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay’s) took
145,465 tons. The amount received for tailings was
£53,733. Assuming that the Zinc Corporation paid
£3370 for the stuff it took, the balance of £50,363
was derived from the 145,465 tons, which means
6s. lid. per ton —a nice little profit to come from
a material, which until a few years ago was a waste
product.

It is, as usual, mediaeval history. The Union is one
of the four mostly English-owned banks doing busi-
ness in Australia, and John Bull has to inspect the
accounts before the Commonwealth may have a look
at them. There is not much the matter with the
institution, unless it be with regard to the payment
of the staff, which is generally supposed to be on the
meagre side. Certainly, to temper the wind to the
clerks who were shorn during the financial crisis
some years agp, the directors occasionally drop them
a bonus; £23,000 has been paid in this way out
of the last half-year’s profits, and this amount
is deducted in the last line of the table.
On the published figures, which don’t throw
any light on this matter, the Union shows up
splendidly. On one point there may certainly be
some difference of opinion. Its paid capital is
£1,500,000, and its reserves £1,442,767 ; total,
£2,942,767. The liabilities (deposits, etc.) are
£25,488,874; so for every £1 which the share-
holders have in the business, according to the books
the public has £8 13s. This, in ordinary circum-
stances, would be regarded as a bit too much, and
the most obvious course would be to increase the
capital, a step which this bank has not taken for
upwards of 30 years. Still, depositors and other
creditors have the protection of a reserve liability
of £3,000,000 on top of the paid capital and accu-
mulated reserves. Moreover, it is probable that there
are reserves which the published accounts do not
disclose. For instance, the bank premises (including
offices let to the public) stand in the books -now at
£512,641, whereas 10 years ago they stood at
£721,933 ; vet, in spite of the reduced valuation, it
is certain that many tens of thousands have been
spent on new premises during the decade. Some-
thing like £60,000 or £70,000 has been expended
in Sydney alone. Whether the same very cautious
policy has been adopted with regard to other assets
is not apparent from the published accounts, but one
would judge that there isn’t much unproductive busi-
ness on the books, from the fact that the profits for
the past halt-year, after deducting the bonus to staff,
were at the rate of £9 15s. lid. on capital and re-
serves combined.
The next small comparison shows the principal
movements during the past 12 months: —

Though customers have been calling for more money,
the liquid assets still amount to 42.1 p.c. of the en-
tire debt to the public, and that allows a comfort-
able margin upon which the bank might draw if
the right sort of securities were forthcoming.

This newest among the big shipping companies of
Australia was formed by an amalgamation of three
private shipping cos. in Melbourne, in 1895. Or,
rather, this is a reconstruction of the eo. that was
formed at that date. When the trinity pooled their
fares, things were just about as bad as they could
be in the trade. Consequently, properties were put
in at a very low value. The improvement started
soon, and practically it has been going on ever since,
partly as a result of a succession of good seasons,
partly through Federation and the fillip which that
gave to inter-State business, and partly through the
shipping cos. sinking their differences in a sea of
“honorable understandings.” In nine years this co.’s
cake was so heavily sugared that, on a revaluation of
assets, it reckoned itself in a position to give its
shareholders a £ for £ bonus. Thus the capital
was increased from £75,000 to £150,000. Subse-
quently £20,000 of new capital was actually sub-
scribed, making the total £170,000. In the table the
dividend is computed on the £95,000 paid in property
and cash; if the distribution is' reckoned on the
£170,000 it comes down to 9 p.c.
Prosperity didn’t come to a full stop with the re-
construction. The following shows the big move-
ments :
Dec., ’O4. Dec., ’ll. June, ’l2.
Steamships and other
non-liquid assets £127,118 £247,795 £256,144
Liquid assets .. 49,052 69,008 70,237
Liabilities .. .. 12,796 33,752 26,295
In eight years, therefore, the co. has increased its
liabilities by £13,499, and it has got in £20,000 of
new capital; total of these two items, £33,499. In
the same period it has added £21,185 to its liquid
assets, and has paid upwards of £129,026 for new
ships and other property. The difference between the
increase of liquid assets and the increase of capital
and debt is £12,213. Deduct from that the £129,026,
and we get this result: In eight years the co., after
paying its dividends, has had £116,713 of gross
profit available to put into ships, etc. From that
very fine amount something must, however, be de-
ducted on account of depreciation. So far as can
be seen, the company does not write down its biggest
items. It pays as it goes for repairs and ordinary
renewals, but of course there is some depreciation
above and beyond that, because, no matter how
sedulously you may patch an ark, it comes to the
knacker’s yard at last. For the same reason —that
is to say, because depreciation is not written off—
the profits shown in the table are bloated beyond
their true size, and the reserves are not all that
respectable reserves should be. These funds are made
up as follows: —-
Insurance and general . . . . £31,421
Special renewals reserve . . . . 5,000
Depreciation fund . . . . 68,650
Unappropriated profits . . . . 10,156
Total £115,227
The insurance, renewal and depreciation funds are
all sub ;ect, to more or less suspicion. For the past
‘six months £9OOO has been added to the renewal
and depreciation funds, and if that amount is hewn
out of the profits, as shown in the last line of the
table, a big hole is made. Still, even then there
would be a comfortable margin left after paying the
dividend. And, since £9OOO for the half-year is
7 p.c. p.a. on the total book value of the whole of
the non-liquid assets, including properties which are
probably not depreciating at all, it seems very likely
that a much smaller deduction would meet the true
necessities of the case. As for risks, the chief one
seems to lie in the possibility that some day the
shipping trade may not be quite the present happy-
family affair. Also, the strengthening demands of the
people on the co.’s paysheets are not calculated to
add to the sugar on the co.’s cake.

It can be put that way, or the amount written off
leaseholds might just as well come off profits
straight away. Probably the latter course has been
previously adopted, though hitherto there has been
no specific mention of a writing down of this asset.
In fact, there is no mention of a writing down of
any asset, though a dissection of the accounts leaves
the impression that that very important matter has
been attended to. If something very considerable
has not been done in this way, the profits during
the last two or three years have not been what
might reasonably be expected, in view of the build-
ing boom and the extraordinary prices ruling for
timber and other goods handled by the co. With
its long experience—and not always a pleasant one
—the management may fairly be credited with
having used its recent opportunities to put itself
in a position to meet the inevitable slump. In one
respect it lias plainly done so, as the followin'' table
shows: —•
1906. 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912.

Cash and book
debts .. .. 32,177 37,149 55,251 38,050 60,907
The most conspicuous line there indicates a whole-
sale clearing out of freehold properties. Freehold
assets, though they give the co.’s accounts a solid
appearance, cannot usually be reckoned on to return
any sumptuous dividend. These sales, helped by the
reduction of stocks, and, to a small extent, bv un-
divided business profits, have permitted of a reduc-
tion of liabilities from .£100,104 to £15,180 in
the last three years, while cash and book debts
have increased from £37,149 to £60,907. The
company is more of a purely manufacturing and
trading concern than it used to be ; a few years ago
its properties represented 60 p.c. of its capital,
whereas now they represent only 33 p.c. This ought
to be some advantage in bad times, because of the
saving in interest on mortgage and other debt.
The co. is, nevertheless, in a business in which
pretty violent fluctuations are almost certain to
continue. When the manufactures of Australia
become vastly more important, and the wool and
wheat growing professions bulk less in comparative
importance, and also when the country gets cured
of its borrowing disease, building and construction
will be less spasmodic. But all this will take time,
and meanwhile Goodlet and Smith’s profits will ride
on a see-saw. And whether the bumps will be
severe depends very largely upon the undisclosed
profit (if any) used to write down assets in the
good times. The capital is £165,000, in shares
paid to 155., formerly they were 20s. paid, but
when property values slumped a few years ago, ss.
was written off. It would be interesting to know
how much of that written-off ss. has been recovered
in the recent sales. Certainly if some of it has not
been recovered, the properties were very much over-
valued until the last two or three years.

This is a case which illustrates the unwisdom of the
N.S.W. Government’s proposal to fix a standard rate
of dividend for gas companies, without regard to the
amount paid by shareholders in premiums to the
company, or the profits left in the business. Com-
mencing in a small way. the co. for many years had
a capital of only £25,000. Then it was increased to
£45,000, at which it stood until a couple of years
ago. The rest of the money required for the exten-
sion of plant, mains, etc., was made up out of profits
which the directors might have distributed, but did
not. Two years ago, though the company still had
very solid liquid assets, it was decided to get in
£22,500 more capital. Shareholders were offered
one new share for every two old ones. But, instead
of getting in only £22,500, the directors asked
for 100 p.c. premium, and this £22,500, which was
paid by the shareholders in the same hard cash, as the
capital itself, was poured into the reserve funds.
The form of the accounts has been somewhat altered
since the December report was issued. Premium
capital is not now shown separately, but in the fore-
going table it has been assumed that as much was
paid in premiums as in capital. The total shown
above as received in premiums amounts to £21,130.
The other £1370 is represented by unallotted shares.
The business has been an exceedingly profitable one,
notwithstanding that gas is sold for 3s. per
1000, or lid. under the Sydney price. The follow-
ing shows the progress from one point of view:— ’
June, 1902. June, 1912.
Liquid assets .. .. £27,780 £35,844
Liabilities . . . . 2,418 7,574
Surplus .. .. £25,362 £28,270
But, in addition, large sums have been spent on the
plant. The book value of the non-liquid assets —
plant, etc. —has moved along from £48,683 to
£138,251, an increase of £89,568. Of this sum
£41,002 has been provided by new capital. Add
£21,130 of premiums, total £62,132. The other
£27,436 has come out of profits. Provided that
depreciation has been sufficiently allowed for, there
has thus been a comfortable margin in excess of the
dividend.

Though it looks to have done very well, this com-
pany has probably not put all its attractions in its
front window. In the past 8$ years its liabilities and
liquid assets have changed in this way:—
Dec., 1903. Dec., 1911. June, 1912.
Liabilities . . £17,546 £17,449 £17,876
Liquid assets 3,859 13,032 11,304
Deficiency .. £13,687 £4,41v £6,572
Thus in these 81 years the net liabilities have been
reduced by £7115. But things have probably been
much better than that. At the end of 1903 the Plant,
buildings and other non-liquid assets totalled
£78,352, whereas now they total £100,226 ; so in
8J years the co. has (1) paid the substantial divi-
dends shown above, (2) wiped out £7115 of debt,
and (3) added, according to the books, £21,873 to
its plant, mains and similar substances. But again
the books probably contain more than meets the eye.
For instance, in the December half of 1903, the
company had a revenue, from gas sales, etc., of
£7438, derived from plant and other non-liquid
property, amounting to £78,352. Now, though the
book value of these non-liquid assets has only in-
creased by 28 p.c., the revenue has sprung to
£13,706, or an increase of 84 p.c. From this it is
clear that either the old mains, etc., are earning a
great deal more than they used to, or the company has
actually spent a great deal more than £21,873, the
amount in excess of that figure having been written

off ostensibly against depreciation. The chances
are that some of both things have happened. In
any case, the position is just about as good as share-
holders could reasonably desire it to be. And all
the plums are not yet picked. The directors now
see their way to use more capital. At present there
are 70,000 ordinary shares fully paid to 10s., and
50,000 pref. shares paid to 75., and liable for another
3s. The £7500 callable on the preference shares
is to be got in and invested in extensions of plant,
including high-pressure mains. Also 80,000 new shares
are to be offered to the present holders, whether of
ordinary or preference stock. This will mean two new
shares for every three no.w held, and, if the whole
10s. is called up, will add £40,000 to the capital.
Part of this monev is to be absorbed by a new
carbonising plant. The directors refer to an expected
“handsome return,” which may, perhaps, be taken as
a hint that the present 10 p.c. will be continued all
round. The issue, nevertheless, appears to be at par,
which, for all practical purposes, means a nice fat
bonus on the plates of shareholders. Still, a gas com-
pany is a gas company, and the N.S.W. movement to
limit the rate of dividends is pretty certain to go
beyond the Ma State’s boundaries. It may be a few years
before anything definite is done; meantime, mis snares
in any part of Australia must be regarded by the
cautious investor as being liable to be called up for
sentence at almost any time.

The Vale of Clwydd belongs to the Western Coal
Association, which acts as its “selling agent.” The
same association also acts as the “selling agent” for
all the other principal Lithgow coal mines—a plea-
sant arrangement which abolishes undercutting and
spells steady dividends. Before this arrangement
was. arrived at, the Western mines lived a dog’s life,
and the same thing would no doubt happen again
if anything went wrong with the “honorable under-
standing.” The management of this co. had, and
possibly still has, no delusions about its mine. It
knew that the thing wouldn’t last for ever, and the
property was consequently written down out of profits.
In other words, liquid assets were accumulated to
take the place of the worked-out coal. Of late
years the co. has been rnaking various small pur-
chases ; hence the amount, if any, written off of
late cannot be checked. Its capital is £45,000.
Mine, plant and buildings represent £33,585, and
liquid assets show a surplus of £14,465. Besides
these items, the co. owns brickworks, into which it
has lately been putting a good deal of money. They
stand in the books at £7334. A coal mine is a
wasting asset, and the Western deposits are wasting
pretty quickly; nevertheless this company, appears
to be doing very well in the matter of making itself
reasonably safe.
Hetton Coal Company (N.S.W.).—After
20 years’ work this co., whose property ran out
under the ocean at Newcastle, found itself and the
Mines Department digging holes in the roof, to see
what sort of an umbrella there was to keep out
the plentiful supply of moisture overhead. As a
result, it decided to look round for a new mine,
and the Bellbird, at Cessnock, was secured. Fortu-
nately the co. had taken time by the forelock, and it
has been able to keep going at the old mine right
tip to the present, when the Bellbird has begun pro-
duction. Though dividends had to be dropped for a
good many years, the old mine made almost enough
profit to open up and equip a new one ; in fact, six
months ago a dividend at the rate of 5 p.c. p.a.
was actually declared. It was premature, however,
and the directors don’t attempt to repeat the per-
formance this half-year. Moreover, in order to
nromptly supply coai trucks and other equipment for
the Bellbird, a 5 p.c. debenture issue of £30,000
has been authorised. Including this plaster, the total
liabilities of the company are £53,674, £16,000 of
which is due to the recent purchase of coal waggons,
while £13,366 has gone during the half-year into
.the Bellbird property. The latter now stands in the
books at £60,454. The more or less liquid assets
total £20,833, and, as the co. is every month in-
creasing the output of the new colliery, while the
old one still has a kick or a cinder left in it, the
Hetton should be able, with ordinary luck, to easily
null through, without getting any deeper into the
bog of debt. The last half-year’s profit was £3050.
Practically the lot is written off the old mining asset,
which, nevertheless, still stands at £BO,OOO. The
capital is £123,665, in £5 shares fully paid.
At the Pulganbar quicksilver and copper
mines (N.S.W.), the construction of .a reducing
plant is making fair progress. The manager states
that “developments have been highly satisfactory,”
and that the hanging-wall of the lode, at the 70ft.
level, carries good values in mercury. There are
several shafts on this propertv, but the workings are
yet rather shallow. The “fahl” ore, which contains
the most mercury, is patchy. There are some nice
veins of cinnabar in the rise from the north 70ft.
level (107 ft. from shaft). From No. 4 shaft the
60ft. level shows good values. The main shaft below
these levels has been unwatered, a plat formed at
140 ft., and driving started. In the face, according
to the official report, there is 18in. of high-grade
“fahl” ore, with lower-grade stuff on each side.
This shaft is equinped with a winding engine. It
will be some months before the condensing plant, to
recover quicksilver, is completed.
Subscriber: Cannot regard the concern as
an investment until it has done more to prove itself.
“Northerner” : The Administrator of the
Northern Territory (Dr. Gilruth) reports that solid
grey Conner ore has been struck in the mam shaft
of the Burne Wolfram Mine, at a depth of about 100 ft.,
near the lower wolfram pipe, against the back of the
Wolfram Creek. The ore averages quite 60 p.c. of
metallic copper, it is stated, and the lode is sft. in
width, and lying between good walls, Burne’s
mine is the largest thing in wolfram in Aus-
tralia. The Nevil, in North Queensland, is next to
it. The history of the mine is interesting. In
1904, when the metal was at £l6O per ton, three
Queenslanders went to the Territory, and took up
the claim, which had been worked unsuccessfully.
The shaft was down 40ft., without striking the lode.
The newcomers drove 20ft., and struck a pipe ot
wolfram, which turned out to be 50ft. long and 'w-
wide. At 60ft. the lode averaged 18 p.c. wolfram
and 6 p.c. copper. In two years the diggers cleared
£4OOO per. man. In the mullocky country .boulders
of grey ore were found weighing 2001 b. and 3001 b.,
going 50 p.c. metallic copper. The workings are ot
the most primitive description. Haulage is done by
the whim process, drawn by a horse. Spring dollies
act as a battery. These are manipulated by Chinese.
The crushed ore is washed in a race, with the old-
fashioned wheel worked by foot. The district is rich
in wolfram, but the demand is not great, and distance
from a railway, high price of cartage, and cost of
labor, prevent the industry from being a paving one.
Copper mines at Mount Diamond cannot pay, owing
to these drawbacks, although a 4ft. and sft. lode
average 7 p.c. and 8 p.c. copper, with rich veins
and leaders interspersed in the lodes. I have a
share in a claim five miles from Burne’s, where the
lode outcrops for over two miles, crossing three lulls.
The lode is 7ft. wide, and will average 7 p.c. wolfram
and 5 p.c. Conner. This will not p»v in the terri-
tory until railways are provided. Then it will pay
like the devil. #

Lake View and Oroya Exploration, Ltd.,
'has passed the Transvaal (W.A.) on to the Mountain
Queen Co. for £4OOO cash and 90,000 fullv-paid
shares. So far this show has been proved down to
240 ft., and the profit in sight above this depth is
given as, £40,000.. The man, however, who_ made
this estimate is regarded as a depressed optimist.
Associated (W.A.) treated 118,735 tons
and recovered £163,538 during the year ended
March 31. Expenditure absorbed £130,476, and, in-
cluding £373 balance from previous year, it had
£33,436 left. Development mopped up £25,636;
shaft-sinking, £2896; ;and depreciation of invest-
ments, £4040 ; leaving £862 to be carried forward.
Liquid assets, . apart from cash in hand, and consist-
ing mainly of Transvaal 3 p.c. stock, Consols, etc.,
amounted'to £124,352. The manager estimated ore
reserves at 500,000 tons, ranging from 21s. to 295.
in value. _ ■ # #
Between January and July Hainault
(W.A.) crushed 38,583 tons for a return, including
proceeds from residues, of £43,555, or £2995 less
than the cost of working. The position is still bad,
and there does not seem much chance of improvement.
Tribute royalties continue the sole means
of support for North Kalgurli (W.A,). About £ 4000
was recovered in July, and the co.’s cut out of this is
estimated at £ 700. Since an, attack of the tired feeling
induced the co. to give tributors a look in, nearly
64,000 tons have been mined and treated for a re-
turn of £135,600, and the co.’s share of this has
amounted to, approximately, £20,000. Altogether,
£286,000 has been dug out of the mine to date, but
■shareholders have not received any of this.
Fraser’s Co., at Southern Cross (W.A.),
has dropped its mine, and is calling tenders for the
purchase of its last remains and equipment. In the
last 21 vears the show has produced £724,450, but
in recent years it has been worked by tributors. The
whole of the gold won came from above 300 ft. Below
that point dfamond drilling did not show the reef to
be worth much, although geologists’ reports predicted
high values in places.
Manager Stockdale has taken charge of
the South Cornwall tin-mining lease, Bushy Hills
(W.A.), on behalf of the Christmas Gift Co., which
has an option over this tin show. Stockdale was
manag°r of Stannary Hills, in N. Queensland,. and
has plenty of energy and experience. There is a
battery near the mine, and when another boiler
arrives and some adjustments are made, crushing
of low-grade ore will be commenced. A call of 2d.
per share has been made.
The Gib is a Victorian river away up
beyond Glen Wills, in the mountains. On its banks
a State mining party has been drilling holes into
what the natives call the Mammoth Lode. This was
to have furnished the district with a mine at last,
but the drills, despite, a little bit of departmental
puffing, have not done much to allure the prospector
to the locality. Some surface stuff went up to 8
p.c. copper, but the boring was in and out, so far
as silver and gold went. It looks as if the Gib
will have to tell to the wind a story of disappoint-
ment over the work done. Still, Glen Wills isn’t
altogether in despair, for the old United Brothers
has been re-opened, and has struck a new shoot of
gold. Pegs are going in to catch the extension,
though the shoots of gold in the mountains, if rich,
are proverbially short.
Hansel Monday, Bendigo, is to be the
motif of the great Chaffinch co. in the future.
This change of venue of one of the leading Bull-
finch floats is decidedly funny. No one tried more
to scotch the Bullfinch boom than A. Rutter Clarke,
who now is the old Clarke and Co., and he wasn’t
cheered in Adelaide for his' interference. Before
that, Rutter had been mining at Bendigo on the
Carshalton line, one' Hill having preached to him
that the diamond-drill ought to pioneer the search
for saddle reefs. Hill has now gone,. but Hansel
Monday remains as one of the leases in which the
Clarke party staked its fortunes. The irony will
appear if the great Chaffinch —now the Hansel Mon-
day—alights on gold, and has a market rush after
the dead work done by ,
Gippsland (Vic.) Copper and Hats half-
yearly report doesn’t conceal the fact that tne
vaunted liappy Gold Mine, which was to save the
companv’s finances, was altogether over-estimated.
To reckon on 2oz. dirt, and then to have to M
down to 13dwt., is a pretty big drop. Alt ough
officiallv only the modest ounce was talked or,
everyone believed that double that quantity was to
show on the plates. Thirteen dwts. woiild^
most Victorian mines, but, with a narrow vein lying
as flat as a pancake, only exes are forthcoming. So,
as the board mournfully admits, no working capita
is available from that source. This hiatus has
driven it to imnlore shareholders to take up reserve
shares at Is. each. So far, there has been as much
response as is shown to the church plate nowadays.
There is reason for this stand-offishness, because at
no time has there been such skill in craftsmanship over
the co.’s copper show as to beget excessive confidence.
All the same, there may be many worse flutters than
a shilling shot at the eo.’s scrip. #
Another derelict that may go on the stocks
for repairs is the old Walhalla (Vic.) Consols mine.
This shaft was once owned by the North Long Tunnel,
and afterwards was pouched by the Extended, when
it needed gold. Like most Victorian attempts at
prospecting, the co. started with a narrow purse, and
an intellectual inability to part with profits needed
to do a big scheme. Otherwise it might have driven
north along Cohen’s reef from the Consols shaft, but
when things are busted it leaves Walhalla folk to
father that scheme. Of course, the project is a
wild and woolly gamble, but there is the rough
chance that a shoot of gold may be happened on.
What Walhalla has to do is to put a little of Henry
Hartrick’s back into the job, just as Wandiligong
has done with its 4000 ft. tunnel. This concern made
halfpenny calls, and kept going till it had pulled off
one of the biggest bits of prospecting undertaken by
a small party anywhere in the Commonwealth.
* * *
The N. Australian Exploration Co. is
securing working options over various Cloncurry (Q.)
copper mines. The Mammoth lode is the most dis-
tant ; it is 134 miles N.W. of Cloncurry township
and one mile south of Gunpowder Creek, which, from
its great length and width of sand before it junctions
with the Leichhardt, might be reasonably called a
river. Like Mount Oxide, the Mammoth has been
known for many years, and five years since, 2| tons
of 30 p.c. ore was packed away to port, which cost
at the rate of £9 10s. per ton of ore. Under such
conditions, the cost of carriage and treatment would
exceed the value of 20 p.c. ore with copper at £7O;
so it isn’t surprising that a rich show like Mount
Oxide remained neglected for so many years. 1 ro-
bably the N.A. Exploration will do some development
on Mount Lindsay lease, which carries a big lode
formation, and is only 14 miles north of the Springs.
It is said that at the north end the lode is 40ft.
wide, but probably the ore is of moderate value, tor
this show has been known for some time past. Very
little work has been done. Exaggerated yarns about
copper properties are to be deprecated.
* * * *
For the quarter ending June 30, Clon-
eurry (Q.) produced 2288 tons of copper, valued at
£167,919, practically all of it from Mount Elliott,
which is popular just now with speculators, simply
because it is a good smelting base, and is also in a
position to purchase any good-looking surface show
within what is undoubtedly a rich copper belt.
Mount Elliott isn’t particular about distance either,
for it recently purchased the King Solomon leases
(160 acres) near the Leichhardt River. The co. has
sent a party of men out to do some prospecting on
this show, and another party has _ gone to the
Native Comnanion leases, Corella River, with a
diamond-drill plant. A description Cloncurry:
Surface shows generally appeal to the imagination,
for copper gouging became a fine art with the advent
of the railway. There is an old tale that in the
early days a parcel of ore, mostly iron, was sent
away under the impression that it was red oxide of
copper. Mount Elliott is a pioneer of deep sinking,
and although the continuity of its deepest _ ore-body
above and below 550 ft. is: unproved, the idea that
Cloncurry copper shows are surface squibs has been
exploded. It seems fairly certain that some good
mines will be developed. Elliott, having made a
good hit with its mine and smelter, is trying its luck
in half-a-dozen prospecting ventures.
St. Mungo copper (Cloncurry. Queens-
land) is sending awav large quantities of high-grade
ore. For June it hauled 120 tons, and for July 101
tons, assaying, approximately, 24 p.c. The shaft is
down 150 ft., but the deepest level (No. 3) doesn t
appear to have struck it rich yet. The driving has
"been in disturbed country. At the end of July, St.
Mungo was £3OOO to the good, in copper ore and
cash; so it is paying its 6d. dividend with ease.
* * * *
Gympie (Q.) lifted its tired heart the
other day, mainly through the doings in Amalgamated
Monkland and Glanmire shaft. The geologist had
proffered his State opinion that a third auriferous
stratum existed at a greater depth than worked m
the Monkland, on the strength of which the Govern-
ment subsidised the mine. For many months the
co. sank on, having nothing to report on other than
the troublesome water, etc. At 1068 ft. the shaft
struck the “black country,” which is always re-
garded thereabouts with a favorable eye. The market
jumped vociferously. But the black gave place to
the long familiar greywacke, and the market felt it
had skied on false pretences. Shaft and shares still
sinking. Still, Gympie calls it “the most important
development of late years.”
* * * *
The christening of the new engine at the
Brilliant Deeps (Charters Towers) gave rise to an
interesting speech by Chairman Millican on the
splendid yields and dividends from the Brilliant and
Day Dawn group of mines. It is singular, however,
that the B. Deep and its closest neighbors, the B.
Extended and B. Block, are three of the poorest in
the group, while the N. B. Freehold, though it
picked up wonderfully in recent years, never paid a
dividend when working exclusively on the Brilliant
reef. The B. Block only recently got down into
deep levels. It is now crosscutting at 2000 ft., and
its 163,163 tons of stone didn’t average £4 per ton.
The B. Extended has been a low-grade mine, with a
profit margin of a few shillings per ton when on its
best behavior. As to the B. Deep, it has been a
sink for money, and even the present reconstructed
concern, in 150.000 shares of ss. each, has only Is.
per share to call up on contributing shares —in other
words, 4s. out of ss. (on 100,000 contributing
shares) has gone in expenses.
The New Brilliant Freehold (Charters
Towers, Q..), rather disheartened by its extension of
No. 14 level from Mills’ United boundary, put in a
northern crosscut on the hanging-wall side, and at
34ft. it struck a vein of mineralised stone, from 12in.
to 20in. thick. A rich loop reef made in the hang-
ing-wall of the upper levels, and No. 6 and No. 7
levels on the hanging-wall branch reef, have provided
a big tonnage of good stone. Of course, the latest
find may prove a squib, but it is a development worth
noticing. * * *
Gilmore Tin (Q.) makes a loss of £1175
on its half-year. Owing to non-arrival of boiler,
the main shaft was only sunk another 12ft., making
it 392 ft., but it disclosed a couple of feet of lode
material. This is a new find, though not proved
valuable as yet. The acid in the water still gives
trouble, eating up the boilers, pumps and pipes, and
playing # 01d Boots generally. # #
The manager’s report of the Bluff (Q.)
Colliery for Julv is blunt: “Not much work was
done, owing to the want of orders, and the railway
deobts being congested.” The co., however, man-
aged to keen up its average output for the June
quarter. An' output of 4226 tons was valued at
£2218, which is just a farthing over the half-
sovereign per ton. The co. has not shed many aivi-
dends; a ninepenny orphan, in 1908, being its only
offspring. Still, its backers deserve a round of
applause for a deal of prospecting. In the Cler-
mont coal centre, beside the Blair Athol Coal and
Timber Co., two others are operating. The B. A.
Extended is down 165 ft., but, so far, has struck
nothing except an abundance of water. The New-
castle Co. (which used to be the B. A. North) lias
“40ft. of superior coal,” at a depth of 133 ft. Water
is an absolute “fair cow” here also, and, pending the
building of a branch line, the co. has asked for ex-
emption. Other coal-mining propositions in the Cen-
tral Queensland division seem to be hibernating.
Philip Charley’s mines at Tryphinia are never men-
tioned, while the alleged wonder discovered at
Stanley seems to have drawn its earthen blanket over
it and gone to sleep again. The Mammoth folk
are still nursing some hopes.

J. H. As tell, manager, gives a certificate
of good character to the little Sterling Valley silver
and lead mine, near Mount Farrell (Tas.). He con-
cedes 7000 tons in sight, though, if his storv of a
2ft. formation isn’t a whale, there ought to
be a bit more stuff than that to look on. What tells
against all these north-west coasters is that a 2ft.
vein of ore looks as big to the owners as one of then-
own mountains. The flea-bitten Victorian who goes
to inspect them measures them up with a Broken Hill
rule (and 80ft. is a small width at Broken Hill).
He overlooks that good things sometimes go into a
small pot, and that these squib veins run to 60 p.c.
of lead and OOoz. silver per ton. There isn t much
cheap mining with them, though—a fact that
makes the Sterling Valley capital of £4OOO ridicu-
lous If Astell’s report doesn’t belie the mine, it
deserves more stuff than that for development, and
A A Farthing would have done much better to have
footed the bill as a director than to waste lawyers’
fees over election expenses and Henry Weedon.

The great advance made in the construction of In-
ternal Combustion Engines has now been further
demonstrated by the fact of Petrol, Benzine, Kero-
sene and heavy Oil Locomotives being brought into
daily and successful commercial use. The machines
are thoroughly reliable, and are cheaper in very
many instances than steam or electric locomotives.
Messrs. Ironside, Son and Dyckerhoff, of London,
have supplied a great number of their famous “New
Century” locomotives nearly all over the world, and
their machines are even working continuously and
safely in “gassy” coal mines. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne, will be pleased to supply further par-
ticulars.*

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, August 26, 1912.
My Dear Arini, —
The Civil Ambulance Ball may have been
the dazzling success its promoters declare it
was, but it looked like a frost. If 450 per-
sons, at a guinea apiece, revolved round the
nearly-empty Town Hall floor, the other
night, a useful cheque ought to be culled
from the expenses. The Civil Ambulance
Brigade wants all the help it can get, and
will joyfully trundle your broken bones (if
it meets them in the highway) to the nearest
hospital, whether you give them five shillings,
nix, or five pounds.
Mrs. Macneill Simpson, hon. sec. of the
ball, believed in, and pushed, the double-
barrelled ticket to the fore. I understand
she sold 70 guineas, or so, worth of entrance
cards. The keen but impecunious dancer
was admitted, under (more or less) distin-
guished patronage, at 10s. 6d. per head. His
or her part in this small charity romp ended
with his right to breathe the same air as the
Guinea Pigs, scrape his impecunious soles on
the municipal boards, snatch a soft drink
from the buffet, and play cards on an upper
floor. About half-past nine there was such
a stampede of Guinea Pigs to the Buffet of
the Poor that one wondered whether the
ten-and-sixpenny lots would be able to welter
in lemonade, or stodge themselves with
Ambulance buns, to the extent of 2d. a
snatch. The Upper Crust (very heavy) had
the privilege of staying the pangs of thirst
with champagne, and filling up any vacant
plots with poultry, etc. It wasn’t playing
the game to attack the vittles of the Poor and
Lowly at an early hour in the evening. The
meek may inherit the earth —some day. At
present, they only munch the heel of the
loaf.
From one of the almost empty galleries a
bird’s-eye view of the Civil Ambulance Ball
gave a magnificent reflection of portion of
out Best Set, with a loud sample of its worst
manners. When a damsel in a furious blue
gown leapt through the Lancers, with a
male scion _ of Society, she swung herself
backwards in a circle —at various epochs in
the fray—while he chased her round and
round, clutching her hands, the while her
tight skirt was strained to bursting point.
The Very Nicest Young Men who kicked
up their heels in Kitchen Lancers, at the
Guinea Pigs’ ball, were mostly a weedy,
undersized selection, with a tendency to sag
in the shirt-fronts. A few of larger build
seemed so weak in the knees that they
knocked these useful joints together as they
danced, and butted their partners down the
room. The women were much better to look
at. A pretty girl in black contrived to wear
a rose scarf on her shoulders at the right
angle—about 45 degrees—and steer her steps
round the patent leather toes of some un-
handy partners. Miss Rhoda Anderson’s
tall frame was draped in beauteous white
garments. Out of a frock, black as mid-
night, rose the white neck of Mrs. Tony
Hordern. Just here a lady in an acute tint
of pink jerked a thin curly tail, no larger than
the narrow end of a blushing lizard, across the
aching void of a lonely patch of floor. I
fancy it was the holding-up loop that had
gone astray. Miss Dorothy Gordon’s bob of
black curls was after —a long way after—
the Lily Brayton-Asche chignon. One debu-
tante was mixed up in the Civil Ambulance
fray, but whether she was a guinea duckling
or only a half-guinea barn-door fledgling, I
know not.
A London correspondent begins her re-
marks re municipal splendor by asking “Why
are Mayoresses dreadful, everywhere?” I
leave it to Gog and Magog, and pass on to
the item, “Dying Swan.” This was the
JMrtle Soup or infantile star turn of a Man-
sion House lady’s party. “A little child gave
a perfect imitation of the Russian dancer’s
Dying Swan.’ The music, a string orches-
tra was divine. The Mayoress was mere
clay. At. a late. hour the poor musicians
found their way into the supper room, and
I saw the Gaudy Mayoress chasing them out
one by one and hitting them with her fan.
“But it is impossible to enjoy these
things,” proceeds my correspondent. “London
is. marvellously improved, bright and clean,
with its electric underground railway, etc.,
but one can’t get away from the squaior and
misery of its East End, which will intrude
its starving stomachs on the public con-
science. .. .Trainloads of bread have been sent
daily to the famished women and children
at the Docks. Saw a living skeleton rush a
bread supply, snatch a loaf, and tear it
apart. She was almost past hunger, but she
thrust her nose into the fresh warm bake
saying Tt smells good.’ These sights make
Australians feel sick.”
An Australian in Europe drops in. “We
went to George Reid’s garden party the
other day. He didn’t look well, but she
looked quite young, with golden curls peep-
ing out under the rim of a Dollv Varden
hat. I hear they are both leaving for a trip
to Australia in March. He has been saving
up his holidays for the purpose.” Re the
juvenile appearance of Mrs. High Commis-
sioner, very fair-skinned women seem to
have some priceless recipe for keeping the
hungry years at bay, to the great annoyance
of their female friends. Cleopatra, by the
way, was a swarthy charmer, but perhaps
she assisted her coal-black locks with raven
strands plucked from the head of some
Lybian slave.
Parson Roseby predominated over the first
10 minutes of the Mary Proctor lecture the
other night. He illuminated the starry dis-
course by being brief, and to the point, then
retired into a total eclipse of gas jets, on
the shadowy side of the Y.M.C.A. platform,
while astronomer Mary prodded the Southern
Cross lantern slide in its coal sack. There
are no strikes up aloft, I imagine, in that
vast black space which lurks, like the dead
end of night, in a forgotten coal seam, be-
tween the Southern Cross constellations.
Then Mary’s clear treble voice floated across
the prosaic cane chairs to the satellite in the
gallery. “Will you kindly change the slide?”
The Southern Cross was removed, and the
coal sack, no longer a sooty negation, leapt
across the screen —a mass of baby stars, like
gold pin points, fighting for their lives in a
fluffy cloud like a torn yellow scarf, or a
dilapidated gas receipt.
Before his eclipse, Parson Roseby dealt
out an anecdote that bears re-telling for the
100th time or so. A group of astronomers
were once revolving round some question of
gravity in the grey old Thames village. It
rained all the time. They had adjourned for
a mundane five minutes or so, to rub down
their gigantic intellects, and sponge a few
billion years off their chests. A casual
stranger broke into their learned idleness.
He dragged aside a visiting star expert.
“What,” said he, “do you think of our
weather?-” “My dear fellow,” replied the
luminary, whose mental focus was about 14
million miles away, “I don’t thing about your
weather at all —l don’t think much of your
world." The mystic star-spangled vault of
night does make mere terrestrial weather
sink into the puddle which is only large as
compared with the earth atoms that splash
through it.
If Canopus, quite a near neighbor, takes
296 years to transmit light to this micro-
scopic world, one presumes the Canopan
gentry and others are now getting an
Earth spark that set out from this
side about the time Walter Raleigh
breathed his last. And, if they have
a sufficiently strong telescope, they can see
James I. beginning to quarrel with his Par-
liament. It is a curious circumstance that,
if you could only shift to a sufficiently remote
star —say, if you joined the Labor party in
the Dog Star —and viewed this planet from
it with a really elephantine telescope, you
could, so far is I can understand the situa-
tion, watch the Battle of Senlac in actual
operation. And then it might possibly strike
you as a strange and weird circumstance
that your own grandfather wouldn’t be born
for 750 years, and you wouldn’t be born till
much later.
This year the Glaciarium Carnival called
itself —or was called by Manager Dunbar
Poole —“The Festival of Allahabad.” An
informative note filled up the fore-part of
the festive _ programme. It dug into the
sands of Time, and exhumed some more or
less well-known traditions of the Ganges and
Jumna streams. The Glaciarium ice patch
was out of joint with the coffee-colored pil-
grims to Allahabad (richly illuminated
centre tabernacle), and the Shrieking Suffra-
gette, yelling for a vote, didn’t skate on the
banks of the Jumna in the days when Mrs.
Chutney Sing was not a Merry Widow.
A team of “Fashions in the Fifties”—
crinolines, bonnets, etc. —arranged by Miss
A. Young; some “Surf Maidens” (Miss L.
Wallis was responsible for this neck-to-knee
outbreak at the “Festival of Allahabad”),
and a “Chanticler party” (Mrs. Beavis was
the lady fowl-in-chief) slithered across the
ice to the Holy Temple of variegated elec-
tric lights. “The Kingdom of the Future”
(“Blue Bird”) was arranged with pale-blue
complexions and hair en suite , by Miss
Hellyer. _ Father Time and the Kingdom’s
only sailing skiff scratched some ice in their
pilgrimage to the shrine. Mrs. H. E. Macin-
tosh got away with a better idea, and ar-
ranged a group of Indian snake charmers,
with a wriggle in their arms. But extract
of pantomime, such as “Steak and Oysters,”
fell very flat in a gorgeous Asiatic dash of
color. The place was packed with specta-
tors, and the cash results ought to have made
the management smile for a week.
The Royal. Art Society seems to have some
infallible recipe for preserving hot air. On
Saturday afternoon a small, compressed
heat wave sat on the roof of the R.A.S.
rooms, and descended on the Private
Viewers’ intellects with damaging effect.
President Lister-Lister’s seagulls—l wonder
if he grows them for home consumption, on
miles of carefully-selected sandscapes—were
amongst the nicest persons present. A
Maoriland artist, Charles N. Worsley, paints
to sell. On Saturday three out of five of
his water-color snacks of Continental scenery
were joyfully labelled “Sold.” The rolling
hills and dales of Ryde are often pursued
with a ravenous palette. Notably the Dar-
vall family’s picturesque patch up that way,
which is said to contain everything an artist
wants, except the frame and glass. Artist
Fischer had some happy moments on the
Darvall sheep tracks. Mostly he plunged
in limpid blue pools and trimmed them
up with frivolous young gum-trees
flirting with the breeze. Mr. G. W.
Hadfield —sometimes a brush man but mostly
a banker; picture-lover Butterfield —an ama-
teur with a feeling for camel’s hair; Senator
Gould and his dame; and a sheaf or two of
private art tasters fluttered round the R.A.
Society’s hot-air department.
“Why does the Royal Sydney Golf Club
hang out its royal washing every Sunday?”
asks a Rose Bay Anarchist, lashed to fury
by the fact that he spends his Sunday after-
noons looking at royal golf sheets beating
the wind, surrounded by a ghostly press of
smaller sail —mostly towels. “A wealthy
club like that,” he snorts, “ought to save up
enough cash to buy two towels apiece for
its residential members and others. Each
Royal Golfist could then have his clean rag
handed to him on Sunday morning. With
economy he could turn it two or three times,
and make it last till Monday evening. Then
Monday’s golf wash would be dry. Or it
would be wet on the line. It is immaterial
to me. At present it is generally wet on
Sundays, and it is a draggled public nui-
sance.” . Then the door slammed, and the
Anarchist fell off several flights of stairs.
Any Maorilander in this city who sees a
flying coat tail, a patch of dust, and a small,
active body tearing round an adjacent
corner, can diagnose the tail and the body
as the property of his Government Agent,
E. H. Montgomery. (The dust belongs to
the Corporation of Sydney.) As likely as
not he will be pursued by various foreign
languages, and their owners. They may be
Bulgarians, Turks, Austrians, or the whole
shack of Babel. Before they leave this port,
as through passengers from overseas, for the
Dominion, it is one of the occupations of
Montgomery, in addition to answering the
100,000 questions of 20,000 per annum
callers, etc., etc., to test the foreigner’s
capacity to read his own name in his
(alleged) native tongue. The process is
wearing the übiquitous E.H.M. to the size of
a very small bag of bones. Austrians he
finds especially annoying. The people of
that country have a marvellous tendency to
make for the Maoriland gum-fields, and the
Dominion’s Agent is always running up
against them. Now this is what an Aus-
trian acquaintance told me about them:
There are 28 parties in the Imperial Legis-
lature. There are 19 or 20 subordinate
Legislatures. The Government recognises
something like 18 languages—that is to say,
if your cook has left without due notice,
you may explain things in court in any-
thing from German down to Serbo-Croatian.
There are probably other tongues that are
not legally recognised—the Bad Debt lan-
guage, and the Tortoise-shell Cat language,
and the Old Boots dialect and such-like —
but there are about 18 to go on with.
Anyhow, the Austrian bound for the Maori-
lan gum-fields runs after the local agent,
with a frayed carpet bag, asking him in
Ruthenian or Slovenisch for the necessary
pass, and the agent naturally runs also.
Hence the dust.
News that the Tony Horderns had booked
their passages for England, in the Medina,
ran round this town on rubber-tyres a week
or two ago. It persistently climbed over the
edge of egg-shell china cackle, and it was
told in Gath and alluded to in the streets of
Askelon. A usually “on-the-mark” corres-
pondent admits, in a voice choked with emo-
tion, that she put the wrong date (Aug. 24)
to the right event. “The Tony Horderns,”
she now explains, “have booked their bunks
in the Medina, but it’s for the March trip.”
Then her tears disarranged the telephone ser-
vice, which suddenly became “engaged” with
unexampled ferocity.
Mr. Burma-rubber Thane sent a blue-
water coo-ee from the heaving bosom of the
Australian Bight. Thane, of Yass, hopes to
come this way again in a year or so. Mean-
time, he’ll travel far beyond the tinkling
bells of Mandalay, to teach the wild young
rubber how to grow up into tame old tyres.
The western coat-tails of the new Chry-
santhemum Emperor have provoked many
remarks re the status of women in Geisha-
land. An American globe-trotter has care-
fully inspected the honorable position of the
average almond-eyed lady in the country
where the honorable ancestor is eternally
dragged, like a very high red herring, across
the track of posterity. The Boston observer
says: “The average Japanese woman is a
soft, lovable little doormat. Her lord wipes
his feet on her with such a profound bow
that the tiny person thanks her honorable
gods for being the wife of so great a man.
It is bad form in good Japanese society—or
was a few years ago—to inquire for the wife
of any Asiatic magnate you may meet. She
never appears in public with her Son of
Heaven or Knight of the Yellow Pip. If
you do say, in our fatuous Western style,
‘How is your wife, Mr. Purple Moon,’ he
will probably reply, ‘My old fool is well, I
believe,’ or, ‘Mv silly goat is looking after
her house.’ His remarks are equivocal. He
is indignant at being reminded in public (if
he be an orthodox Jap) of the existence of
the little ivory-faced dolls on the domestic
mat.”
The society Sutherlands, of Palmerston
North (M.L.), have been dallying with plea-
sure in these parts. They climbed up to
Brisbane from this port, and had a look in
at the northern village while it throbbed
with the commotion of the Gee-Gee’s glitter-
ing staff.
Auctioneer Newcombe, of Auckland, and
his lady, are sampling the sights in this city.
I hope they’ll escape the scorching taxi-cab,
the racing motor and the mosquito herd of
small boys on bicycles, and dodge the enraged
cab-horse which tries to chew the heads off
strangers at the crowded corners of our prin-
cipal streets.
Miss Constance Salmond (Elizabeth Bay)
left in the Osterley for India’s colored
strand. Stowed away in the Orient liner’s
hold, or some other reliable anchorage, is
the Sydney maiden’s trousseau, a young
mountain of foamy lace and diaphanous
muslin, built for the sultry land of curried
liver. The ’groom is Dr. Roberts, now of
Calcutta, and once-upon-a-time of Tassy’s
strawberried isle, where he hung out his
sign and crest in the hamlet of Hobart. The
wedding will occur in Colombo. The bride’s
mother, Mrs. Salmond, and her step-sister,
Miss Palmer, will sign their names to the
legal document. After that, Constance will
glide into the chota hazreq and tiffin habit.
As a Mem Sahib, her home will be in Cal-
cutta.
Florence Quinn, who took the part of Con-
stance in that loquacious morality play,
“Everywoman,” is now appearing on the other
side in musical frivolities. As Natalie in the
whirling “Merry Widow,” the Auckland
girl’s light and tuneful voice gets a show
under the George Edwardes management.
Concerning nothing in particular, a new
occupation for able-bodied and ambitious
young men of expensive habits may evolve
out of regular seasons of opera in this water-
front. It will be sub-headed, “The War-
bler’s Husband.” Applicants must be pre-
pared to hate work before they see it. They
must produce one or two titled relatives —
even a city knight will do in an emergency—
who can swear (most of them do) that
Adolphus Augustus has never soiled his
shirt-cuffs by earning the price of a meal in
his life. He, in turn, must see his prospec-
tive bride’s salary paysheet, and insist on
liberal settlements. His chief occupation
will keep him fairly busy. He will be ex-
pected (by the star) to make himself as dis-
agreeable as he knows how to the manage-
ment. He can keep in practice by letting
the rest of the company thoroughly under-
stand that there is only one singer in the
Commonwealth—Mrs. Adolphus. This will
lash _ the operatic menagerie into a state of
homicidal frenzy. If they break anything,
the management will have to pay. Adol-
phus can sit back and arrange his repartee.
The last yell of the Cisneros concert sea-
son, on this shore, smote the listening ear in
the weary old. Town Hall, the other evening.
A large audience trailed into its closely-
packed seats in more or less underdone even-
ing drapery until after 8 p.m. Then ’cellist
Liebling gave the nimble Harold Whittle the
nod, and a murmur like the wind growling in
the tree tops rolled out of the ripe old Strad.
Eleonora starred the programme with a ven-
geance, and took the centre of the stage and
the whole incandescent blare of limelight.
She _ also took prolonged annlause from a
public that loves a handsome woman with
a large voice.
Mrs. Cisneros looked tired and not over-
pleased with things in general, when she
first swept her azure drapery to the front
planks of the dais on Saturday night. Ap-
plause—like nectar from the gods to all pro-
fessionals-—cheered her into better looks.
But her Plumpness was obviously weary,
and her usually resonant voice, with its
amazing range, had ragged edges. The lady’s
indifferent ear to pitch gives her a tendency
to sing flat, with much fortitude, for an odd
bar here and there. The sharp, clear tones
of the piano showed up every dull note in
“Softly Awakes My Heart” (“Samson and
Delilah”) with the brutal frankness of an
honest friend.
Tenor Paul Dufault sang through a des-
perate sore throat, which blurred the beauty
of his invaluable lower register, and knocked
the silver lining off his priceless top notes.
Dufault was too ill to produce anything but
a junior understudy of the tenor that has
captured tuneful Australians of every size
and waist measurement. I hear, on the worst
authority, that he dashed off to his hotel,
after the concert, to seek the aid of every
known remedy in the medical language. The
same bad authority says the French-Cana-
dian has survived the assaults of one dozen
mustard plasters, a gross of really reliable
gargles, and half a cwt. of soothing lotions.
He hopes to be a complete resurrection at
Auckland.
Conductor Arundel Orchard has folded up
his baton for a holiday. At present he is
stalking the scenery in Maoriland, where you
softly and surreptitiously waylay the ant-
lered forest, and seize the pigheaded scrub
by the tail.
Yours, on the leafy brink of Wattle Day,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 26, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Geoffrey Syme is lying coVered with glory
and honorable wounds at his home, after
landing the biggest fish of the burglar season.
Mrs. Geoff, missed the awful encounter by a
day. She was packing up her clothes, pre-
paratory to returning from a visit to Sydney,
when the scramble was happening. Now she
is engaged listening to the plaudits of her
husband’s pluck, hugging her unharmed
babies, and extolling the bravery of Nurse
Rosa Beggs, who helped to knock out the
intruder. Cook is an unlauded heroine.
(Don’t make that unlarded!) She is a
woman of weight, and, after ringing up the
police, she sat firmly on the man like a
Royal Commission, and squeezed the last
vestige of fight out of him. The captured
gentleman (or should it be nobleman?) was
after big game. Mrs. Geoff, possesses jewels
such as few women outside the duchess de-
partment of life can boast. She did not
take many of the gauds to Sydney, and rarely
wears the whole calamitous blaze, unless to
a “Kismet” dance, or a big night at Covent
Garden. Burglar bait of that sort is always
bitten at desperately, sooner or later.
The shock of his wife’s death, coupled with
a severe attack of pneumonia, took Mr.
Hope-Campbell so near the Shadow that his
doctors have had to fight hard. Miss Hope-
Campbell, a smart sporting girl, who rides
well and is a great collie fancier, is secre-
tary of the Ladies’ Kennel Club. The recent
show had to struggle along without her.
Nan Nankivell, whose grandfather was
old Coroner Youl, is to wear a priceless
Spanish veil at her wedding to Jocelyn
Thomas, of Tasmania. The handful of cob-
web was treasured for many years by great-
grandmother Martin, but the shade of the
original Spanish owner perches high up on
the family tree. The wedding feast is being
spread by Miss Youl in the Hotham-street
house in Bast Melbourne.
The late W. A. Zeal left enough money to
the Old Colonists to build and endow two
cottages, and last week Governor Fuller
did the silver-trowel act appertaining
thereto. After the ceremony, President
Grice led their Exes, and one fair-haired
Fuller daughter through an avenue of flags
towards the refreshments, while' a band
rattled in the vicinity. There are almost
100 cottages now in the settlement, which
grows steadily in cheerful spurts.
Marjorie Levey having twisted her knee,
a kindly doctor has ordered her to retire
from the preparatory chiffon hunt, and
forego the kitchen tea, timed for the final
fortnight before her wedding to Guy Miller.
(One advantage about these minor mishaps
is that they afford a restful interval.) In-
teresting to recall that a smart bride who
was similarly afflicted a few months ago,
and who superintended preparations from a
comfortable couch, did not show the slightest
trace of lameness as she marched up the
aisle. But then the question is: Was any
girl ever too lame to skip to the tune of The
Voice That Breathed?
Someone tells me that Mrs. D. B. Lazarus,
the pretty, dark-eyed bewitcher, is busily in-
specting Europe, its cities and kings. She
is shortly due to start the homeward voyage.
Squatter Fred Armytage has been strug-
gling against an attack of bronchial pneu-
monia, which laid him flat whilst he was
grass-widowering in a St. Kilda paying
guestery. Later, he was seized upon by
his niece, Miss “Como” Armytage, who
transferred him to the family mansion on
Toorak-road, and there two nurses dragged
him through the crisis. Mrs. Fred is at pre-
sent having her eyesight looked to in Ger-
many, and the family is anxious to be able
to cable news of the squatter’s complete
recovery.
Mrs. Joshua, the elder, who was lately
knocked down by a butcher’s cart in Toorak-
road, is now nursing a couple of broken ribs
and an injured arm. She is getting along
nicely, and manages to enjoy life so long as
she doesn’t (1) jolt her arm, (2) see a
butcher’s cart, (3) hear a tram bell.
Help Awdry, who was called away from
his unexacting duties in the Fuller house-
hold to look after his deceased father’s real
and personal estate, has decided to remain
in England. Said that his Victorian Ex. is
not going to fill his place on the staff, but
will struggle along with a smaller estab-
lishment.
Hardy Wilson and Norman Carter, both
of whom hail from Sydney, are visiting this
city. They have turned up every day at
McCubbin’s crowded picture show, in the
upper room of the Athenaeum.
Ice-skating seems to have got a firm finan-
cial foothold in our midst. At the outset of
the winter the Glassy Harem threatened to
close' its season on August 17. Then the last
final glide was postdated to the 31st, -and
now General Desire, with his skates on, has
persuaded the Glassy management to con-
tinue business for yet another week. The
thaw will not set in until after September 7.
Then the Taits bring their pictures back to
the building.
Malvern Mayoress Wilks is auctioning
tables at a bridge party for the financial
benefit of the Home for the Blind. The char-
itable ruse should be successful, for women
will rise like fish on a grey day to a bridge
call. The card craze, in fact, is so violent
that dressmakers, hitherto the most auto-
cratic of people, complain that they cannot get
their customers (or patients) to attend for
“fittings.” Women are not content to stand
on the bridge at midnight. They sit down to
it morning, noon and subsequently.
In the name of Charity, still they frivol.
Hawthorn is now offering society a chance
to air the harem skirt built for the Kismet
Ball, at ss. a head, or 2s. 6d. a leg. Date,
Thursday, August 29; place, the Hawthorn
Town Hall. The contents of the cashbox
go to the local Ladies’ Benevolent Society.
The C.L.C. Ball rolled merrily, in Mel-
bourne Town Hall, last week. The dance
was originally the exclusive revel of the
senior girls of the Catholic Ladies’ College ;
but, as time went on, it attracted many out-
siders, as well as the old girls and their
attached husbands. Eily Brenan, youngest
of the eight jolly Brenan sisters, took the
whole of the secretarial worries on her fair
shoulders this year, and her proud parents
smiled from the chaperonic chairs. Mrs.
St. Leger attended in habiliments of woe to
help her old school frivol; and Dr. Lynch
brought a dazzlingly pretty niece. General
Gordon danced through the programme, and
daughter Eily, just grown up, signified the
fact by wearing a long, lilac-colored dress
and coiling her black hair. The debutantes
were so numerous that their set took up the
whole of the floor. Later, they reformed into
small sets and skipped gracefully, whilst
proud female relatives clutched the white
bouquets. All the corridors and upstairs
rooms were available for the sitters-out;
but the flappers chose the stairs for a ’tween
dance rest, and perched in fluffy cheekiness
with callow, adoring partners.
A well-trained domestic servant is the
noblest work of —the Girls’ Training Home.
The forthcoming dance in aid of the institu-
tion threatens to be a great success. The
tickets have gone off like crackers in a fur-
nace, or a horsey solicitor who has been left
in charge of trust funds ; also, many dona-
tions have rattled in. and there promises to
be keen competition for the Staughton prize
for the most original set. Any person who
desires' to spread the light of the Higher
Maryannticism may do so, and, incidentally,
secure some good entertainment, by buying
a ticket. The revel happens in Prahran,
on Tuesday, September 3.
Invitations are out for Mrs. Staughton’s
final dance, on September 7, in the Domain-
road house. After that date, the Alex.
Landale widow takes possession of the resi-
dence ' for a term, while Mrs. Staughton
seeks rest from politics and entertaining in
foreign travel. Only the people who work
seem to be able to exist without rest.
The John Forrests gave a big dinner "at
the Grand, on Friday night. A blazing semi-
circle of the Very Best motors hedged in the
tall hotel during the long hours of feeding.
When all the victuals had been slain and dis-
persed, the hostess led the women from the
scene of carnage to the drawing-room up-
stairs, and left Bigjohn and the men to their
tobacco. An orchestra hidden in a corner
supplied the accompaniments for the conver-
sation. Mrs. Forrest wore a soft and fluffy
blue dress and a new diamond tiara. Mrs.
Albert Miller had a turquoise blue bow
pinned on her grey hair with a diamond.
Mrs. Power fluttered on the next step in
black chiffon, and Mrs. Casey inhabited a
swathed black silk trimmed with jet.
Squatter Eddy Officer, an enthusiastic art
patron, wants Melbourne to have an annual
art show which will comprise the picked work
of the best men. Hardy Wilson has brought
the idea from Sydney, but Melbourne has
begun to agitate for the affair, on the ground
that it has by far the best buying record.
Officer and his following are arranging a
beautiful dinner, over which the artistic
point can be argued.
Daisy Ireland, a vision of loveliness in a
cream tailor-made and bewitching hat to
match, was leading lady of a matinee per-
formance at Christ Church, St. Kilda, last
week. She made her entrance on the arm
of her dad, the veteran actor, being otherwise
supported by her mother and sister Harrie,
and a small family party, through the popu-
lar comedy drama which ends with the
vestry act. The heroine changed her
name to Jamieson, and her spinsterhood was
counted out. Later in the day, the happy
pair went honeymooning to Bendigo, and,
after a week at the Shamrock Hotel, they
are to be motored all the way to Deniliquin,
where the bridegroom is architecting his for-
tunes. In a home newly furnished for the
occasion, Daisy Jamieson will take to the
domestic stage in real earnest. Meanwhile,
sister Harrie Ireland has accepted a nrofes-
siona.l engagement with the Anderson Co.,
at the King’s, and is appearing as a dis-
tressed female in “The Girl Who Knew a
Bit.” Presently she will be “A Dangerous
Woman,” which is her most frequent line of
character —on the stage. Off the stage,
Harrie, of the Titian hair, is not a bit dan-
gerous. She always appears to be trying to
atone in private life for the crimes she has
committed in melodrama.
One of the most charming pictures in the
present show at Melbourne Athenaeum
Gallery is Fred McCubbin’s bush study, "Sil-
ver and Grey,” which his wife stamped with
an artful red label to save it from being
snapped up. But everybody with 60 guineas
to spare wants that poetic piece of gumtree
laden land. One of the Syme brothers was
begging for it last week, and perhaps he
got it. Seeing that Art is always crying
aloud for sympathy and succor, the gentle
craze for picture-buying ought not to be dis-
couraged.
Contralto Kirkby Lunn confronted a vast
Town Hall audience on Saturday night,
arrayed in an exquisitely-built chiffon gown
of the latest Bougainvillea shade. Her
brown hair, beneath a pink-purple cap, took
on a Titian hue, and an osprey like a
comet’s tail or burst water main, trembled
in her wake. The distinguished singer is a
big woman, but toddles on and off the stage
like a Japanese. Her soft, rich tones, flow-
ing out without the slightest effort, made
ordinary folk purr with delight and musical
critics swoon right away. The slight and
youthful William Murdoch, who hails from
these parts, smote his piano like a Hercules,
and won several avalanches of applause.
Violinist de Ribaupierre, a young man with
a feminine shock of hair and a soft, appeal-
ing touch to his bow, sawed brilliantly
through some musical serials. Baritone
Andrew Shanks, a handsome young Scot
with a pleasant burr and a very correct
manner, scored well with some national
songs. The two singers of the co. have .a
fine repertoire of Scotch airs, and there is a
good time before the people who eat bagpipes
and love the wild strains of the haggis.
Baritone Andrew Shanks, of the Kirkby
Bunn co., is a decorative young man who
hails from Barrhead, near Glasgow, where-
abouts his father is a man of some note. The
newcomer has several Australian student
friends to look up. He speaks of Hal Cohen, the
stout and pale young tenor Melbourne knows
so well. Hal, it seems, is doing well at the
Paris Opera House, and has played a part
in Lord Howard de Walden’s opera, at the
Ilammerstein Theatre. Many Australians,
by the way, mention with pride that they
have sung at the de Walden mansion.
Society hurried along inquisitively to the
Kirkby Lunn reception, in the Town Hall,
last week. The contralto was so over-
whelmed that she shed tears into her
bouquet of violets, and severely scalded
the modest blooms. Her beautiful
weeping frock had a coral base half-
hidden in a fog or mist of neutral-
colored veilings, and her hat possessed the
smart heavenward tilt at the side that seems
to be the latest dress idea with imported
personages. R. S. Smythe, an old and
ardent admirer, sat on the platform dressed
to perfection. The veteran showman can
still give points to any afternoon-tea young
man. Gaud Mayor Davey made the usual
speeches, and his dame, under a peck of
ostrich feathers, helped in the pumphandling.
Mrs. Charlie Tait sported a dainty black-
and-white creation. One platformed lady
wore two large white bon-bons in a black
hat. The star-worshippers swirled and
crowded at the upper end of the room, while
distracted maids, laden with tea, worried
plaintively through the press.
Melba lent two fearfully valuable SSvres
jars to the Art Gallery just before her de-
parture. They are decorated by Dutanda
and Buteux (1780-90), and are dumpy little
bowls with little pink roses on their cheeks.
The loan exhibits are in the fourth case
amongst other Shvres treasures.
It was murmured that Melba had some
intention of starting smart and up-to-date
supper rooms in this ill-fed city, but the
distinguished lady has departed without men-
tioning anything of the kind. Melba cer-
tainly has a well-educated palate, and can
tell a good cook at sight; but the amazing
rumor appears to be founded on nothing
more than that. A well-inflated balloon is
about the only thing that needs less founda-
tion than a rumor.
Alexander Watson, these nights, is draw-
ing the Smart Setters to the Athenseum by
the motor load, and so many seats are re-
served that the humble two-bobbers are away
back on the hard stools of repentance under
the balcony. But Alexander is in the wizard
line, and transports the humble florineers
in spirit to blasted heaths, so that they cease
to worry about this bitterly hard world, or
to envy the ospreys and opulent dress tails
of the Well Dined in front.
Harcourt Beatty and his wife have taken
a place at Dandenong, and are playing com-
mercially with pigs in the intervals of foot-
lighting. He is due in Sydney this week for ,
a J. C. Williamson show, so the pigs will
have to be valeted under someone else’s
supervision for a while.
Dorothy Grimston (Mrs. Meyer) has tired
somewhat of the plain domestic round, and
is going back to the stage under the Cosgrove
management. The two small Meyers are to
be planted happily in a cottage by the sea at
Frankston, and Mamma will help them to
build sand castles when she can rush away
from bellowdrama cares.
Arthur Greenaway and Rosslyn Vane have
joined forces matrimonially and profession-
ally. They were married, on July 5, and
when husband Greenaway has finished a
scamper round Maoriland with the Plimmer-
Titheradge-Brough people, he and his charm-
ing wife are to do sketch work at Musgrove’s
new theatre in Sydney. Miss Vane came
here with Nellie Stewart, and flickers in the
“Sweet Nell” pictures with the Australian
star. She played last with the Ethel Irving
co. Since that time, she has undertaken a
star part in the operating theatre of a Syd-
ney hospital. (When a nurse tells you that
she has been, to the theatre, it is always well
to ask “Which one?” before you start any
stage gossip. They mention the tragic variety
in a bright professional way which is very
deceptive.)
A stirring yarn or lie is now travelling up
and down Toprak. It is all about a valuable
fur coat, which grows larger and more valu-
able every time the tale is told. The more
or less fabulous garment is alleged to have
been taken (presumably by mistake) at an
evening squash by a large lady of the very
first rank. She somehow struggled into the
wrap, which was not built for a woman her
size, sailed home, and continued to wear it
for three days or so. Finally, she realised
that she was like to perish of apoplexy if she
g o<: any stouter. Then she recollected that
all the bad symptoms—tightness across the
chest, shortness of breath, sense of depres-
sion, etc. —only came on when she was weai--
ing the coat. She had another look at it
and was dreadfully shocked and pleased to
hnd that it wasn’t hers, after all. The par-
tially-burst gaiment was smilingly returned
to the owner, and all was well again—all
except the owner’s temper, which was in
rags.
From my Adelaide correspondent
At the A.R.C. Grand National Meeting, at Vic-
toria Park, on Saturday, Amgoorie, in the Steeple,
returned backers £63 for second place. Other divi-
dends ranged from £8 to £l6. The weather,
figuratively speaking, returned a £lOOO divvv to
everybody. It was the dizzy limit. Government
House was there, in all its spectacular glory. Messrs
Hawker and. Keith Bowman scored with Jlardrada
and Tadanga , but Dr. Bennett had what our Israelit-
lsh brother terms “hard mozzle.” The best of his stable
could do for him was two paltry seconds.
In the evening- the Government House men-folk
dined with the Commercial Travellers I heard
some mendacious-looking people remarking, in a
tram, that the vice-regalities have been telling each
other railway-carriage anecdotes (the sort that have
a gay blue haze round them) ever since.
The Golf Championship meeting opened at Seaton,
on Saturday, and for the next week or so the howl
of the mashie and the skirl of the lofter will be
audible on all sides.
, r T J' e relict , of °l<J William Milne, knight, died at
North Adelaide on Saturday. She was an Australian
since 39. Her people, the Dishers, originally settled
m the Hills districts. A genuine, authenticated 95-
year-old she was at the time of her death. Her
husband was President of our Legislative Council
and one of her daughters is married to Lancelot
Stirling, the present holder of that job.
On the same day there died, ait Glenelg, J. F.
Cudmore—one of this State’s biggest pastoralists.
His father originally went to Tasmania,, and. while
there chartered a ship to cross to the mainland,
J. r. Cudmore being born on the voyage over. The
family began their chase after Mammon as brewers
at Kapunda. Then they went on the land, and
founded Yongala and Paringa stations, the latter
on the Murray, opposite Renmark. Also, being
catholic-minded folks as regards money-making they
gave Queensland a trial. When the Westralian
gold rush began, J. F. cut loose and joined it. He
erected the first crusher that lone and dusty but
opulent, region had ever seen.
W. J. Young, popularly known as “Chubby,” re-
turned from England by the Malwa.
Trouble —in fact, not to put too fine a point on it,
plain Sheol—threatens in connection with Mr
Smeaton’s Licensing Bill. The W.C.T.A. people are
satisfied with it, which is tantamount to saying that
the women licensed victuallers, of whom there are
67 in Adelaide, regard it as the work of a cold-
blooded robber and anarchist. Who was- it wrote-
“ Hell hath no fury like a female pub-keeper who
considers herself Wronged?” I d.sremember for the
moment. Anyhow, he expressed a great and abiding
Ter-ewth.
The “move on” business is being somewhat over-
done in this township. A motorist had £1 11s.
extracted from him recently, because his car stood
in Rundle-street for more than 20 minutes. To pull
up and fire a genial “How d’you do” and sundries at
a friend, in that same street, is something- equivalent
in the eye of the Law, to robbing a till. Yet, at
the Imperial corner, bold, bad, whisky-scented men
comport themselves as though they were on a race-
course, and no one runs them in. ' Why this is so I
know not: yet so it is.
One of those strange beings who would rather do
any arduous thing than a joh of honest work swung
clubs for 63 hours, at Kapunda, this week, and then
collapsed. Strange the perversity of human nature!
One constantly hears of collapsed club-whirlers, but
who ever heard of a man collapsing as a result of
an overdose of (say) brick-laying or tree-felling?
The departing Mannheim took 99.706. bags of wheat
from Wallaroo to Las Palmas—a record. Also, the
German boat is the first fitted with wireless which
has put in at the mining port.
Springton, a diminutive town in the remoteness of
a coaching district, has just killed the first snake
of summer—in fact, to be exact, a brace of them.
It is duly proud of the distinction, but in no wise
arrogantlv so. The jealousy of the surrounding ham-
lets is absolutely contemptible.
Just as I was straightening up my hair, removing
the ink-stains, measuring out my brain-reviver and
otherwise endeavoring to pull myself together after
the terrific strain of composing the prose poem which
I send to you, came -an item of news which simply
refused to he left out of my weekly epic. It concerns
Lavington Bonython ( what a name!) Emperor—for-
give me, Mayor of Adelaide. He is engaged. You
start, you reel! As I expected. Steel yourself now
for a fresh staggerer. The lady is Miss Warren,
loveliest of maidens, and a niece of ex/Senator John
Downer. The lucky man is, of course, the son and
heir of Langdon, and his wealth is so vast that he is
reputed to be indifferent to rises in the price of
sugar, while the bills of Gas Trusts and so on leave
him calm and unafraid. Farewell! I still feel quite
disordered over the thrilling business.
“liosna” sends three long-distance chirps
from London :—-
With a heat wave rolling across London, the Pie
Comissioner Reids gave a party at Prince’s Gardens,
on July 16, for -Australians in Britain. It was a
sort of scattered garden event, the guests meander 1
ing from flowery reception rooms to the square, and
from the square to an opposite mansion full of tea
and ices. The Reid dame and her daughter blos-
somed -forth in white muslin and big hats. The
guests included Dudleys, McEacharns, Taverners,
Coekburns and Mackellars. The Reids go to Canada
in August.
An orange-blossoming of Australian interest oc-
curred at Cambridge the other day, the victims 'being
W. Spens, Fellow of Corpus Christi College, and
Dorothy Selwyn, grand-daughter of the late T. S.
Mort', of Sydney. The ceremony occurred at Selwyn
College, of which the bride’s father was master for
five years. Selwyn Chapel had daisies in its altar
rails, and innumerable Morts and other relatives in
the pews. The bride’s father was formerly Bishop of
Melanesia, and she spent her infant days on Norfolk
Island.
Miss Monica Sharland, a clever Apple Islander,
has been appointed companion or Lady-Help-in-
Waiting to Princess Monica, daughter of a Russian
bomb-target named Nicholovitch, or Infuriated Cats.
Miss Sharland is a brilliant linguist, being able to
converse in at least six languages. One disadvan-
tage of this accomplishment is that wherever you go.
you know exactly what insulting remarks the cab-
man is making about you.
Yours affectionately,
Johanna.

POLITICAL
POINTS
N.S.W. Pub. Works Committee has re-
commended the construction of a line from
Condobolin to Broken Hill (372 miles), at a
cost of a trifle of -li million, one of its
reasons being that once this line is built, the
Broken Hill ore will be able to travel 700
miles by rail to Sydney instead of proceed-
ing to its natural outlet via S.A. Also, on
general principles it is thought that the line
will make the Barrier feel that Sydney is
nearer to it than Adelaide. Thus are the
great, starved ports neglected, while the
demented Ma State gets ready to ask Cohen
for more money wherewith to drag heavy
goods all the way round by Sheol and break-
fast and Timbuctoo, and show them the
scenery on the road.
In the matter of the historic memorial
gallery, or whatever the thing is called, the
Australian Government is going to be gen-
erous to those artists who are to preserve
the political heroes in oils. The price fixed
upon for a portrait is £250. Longstaff, who
is easily our best portrait painter, took com-
missions at £225, so Andrew Fisher is doing
the thing handsomely with public money that
would be much better applied to the trans-
continental railway. Still, the gallery will
fill a want. It will furnish the public
with one more place to stay away from, and
the more places you stay away from the
more time you have to go to the places that
are worth visiting.
STATE INSECT
RIVALSY.
MELBOURNE, Sunday.—Mr. Watt, the State Premier, has become alarmed at the announcement that
the Federal Government will pay yearly rent for Government House, Sydney....The Government of
Victoria will now, he says, have to examine carefully its agreement with the Commonwealth with respect
to the occupation of Government House and Parliament House, in Melbourne. These buildings, he points
out, are still being occupied without payment.— Daily Telegraph news item.
WEE WILLIE: "'Eavens! I must wake tip a bit; there's that N.S.W. feller AGAIN
draw in' first blood from the beast."
South Australia is evidently getting near
the point where, in the absence of an im-
proved tariff, something must break. In 1911
the number of employees in its factories only
showed an increase of 897 as compared with
1910, but wages increased by £321,988 —
from £B6 Os. 9d. per employee, men, women,
girls and boys all included, to £94 16s. The
foreigner isn’t shoving up his wages at any-
thing like that rate. So he climbs more and
more enthusiastically over the deficient
barrier with his bale of sweated labor goods,
and climbs back with the money which this
country can so ill spare.
Senator Millen, of N.S.W., rose in quite
a cheerful frenzy the other day because the
Federal capital (in Millen’s State) isn’t
being pushed on as fast as Millen desires.
Yet the capital is being pushed on faster than
the Northern Territory railway and
the Northern Territory settlement. And if
these two matters are neglected, the result
may be the utter ruin of Australia, while the
Dryberra Metropolis might be postponed for
2000 years without making this country a
whit less safe than it is to-day. It is a pity
that a mere scrap of parish dignity should
loom so much larger, in the view of small-
minded men, than the future of a continent.
It is announced very definitely that the
present N.S.W. Parliament will hang on till
it expires by the effluxion of time. Probably
nothing else was to be expected, but it seems
a pity. When the deadlock came to pass
through the two parties being exactly even,
and neither desired to put a man in the
Speaker’s chair lest it should be thereby left
in a minority, Henry Willis came to the
rescue and took the presidential job on cer-
tain conditions. One of these, as openly ex-
pounded by Attorney-General and Acting-
Premier Holman, was that legislation of a
controversial character was to be avoided,
and that the Assembly was to be dissolved
as soon as the redistribution of seats had
been attended to. But the chance of a by-
election gave the Government a majority,
and put it in such a position that it could
break its pledge with impunity, and it
promptly broke its pledge. Whether it was
worth while to earn a large measure of pub-
lic contempt, for the sake of hanging on, is
a matter between itself and its conscience.
Some people think it wasn’t worth while.
The notice paper of the N.S.W. Assembly
is a melancholy chronicle of small beer. It
is also, at times, a chronicle of very compli-
cated beer. Thus Minahan, M.L.A., rose
the other day to ask 22 questions in a heap,
the first three being as follows :
(1) In dealing with the offences committed by
children from five to 16 years, are the adjudicating
Special Magistrates at the Metropolitan Children’s
Court seized with the fact that a broad knowledge
and free exercise of psychological principles are
essential to a successful administration of a Chil-
dren’s Court ?
(2) Will he inquire whether the provisions of the
Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act are
sufficiently comprehensive to enable the adjudicating
Special Magistrate to exercise this knowledge of
psychological principles which should guide him in
his treatment of dependent, neglected and mentally
or physically defective children, or children otherwise
unfortunate and coming within the jurisdiction of
the Court ?
(3) Has the present presiding Special Magistrate
of the Metropolitan Children’s Court any qualifica-
tions based upon an intimate knowledge of PSYCHO-
LOGICAL principles; and, if so, is it a fact that
certain decisions of his indicate that he does not
exercise them?
There were 19 other problems, mostly murky
and “psychological.” All were strangely
suggestive of Dickens’s old publican in “Bar-
naby Budge”—the man who ran the drink-
ery at Chigwell. and prided himself on his
gift of “argeymint.”
Last financial year the Commonwealth
made £147,629 profit on its silver coinage.
It is a pleasant sum, and suggests that
Britain made quite a lot of money out of us
bv buying 4d. worth of silver from Broken
Hill putting a stamp on it, and sending it
back as Is. Yet coin is a thing that wears
out, and has to be replaced. Therefore, it
would be well to invest this and future pio-
fits in Government securities, and let the
fund accumulate at compound interest tor
two or three centuries. Such of it as wasn t
required for the renewal of the coinage would
come in very handy some day for the oblit-
eration of the public debt.
No wonder the big Melbourne Gas Co.
theatens to further reduce the price of its
goods. The competition is becoming fierce.
Not only are four Houses of Parliament sit-
ting more or less intermittently on Yarra
side, but there is the A.N.A. conventicle, the
Presbyscotch synod, various church conven-
tions, the Christian Endeavor confab, the
Political Labor Leagues and too many other
corroborees. And now there has arisen,
through inward cussedness and malice afore-
thought, a Young Liberal Speakers’ Associa-
tion, and the mouth thereof will make a
breeze that will blow all the brown paper
in creation through the city and out on to
the bay.
The Australian Government called the
other day for tenders for a fairly-big public
work in the N. Territory, and, apart from
dead silence, there was no reply whatever.
Probably the matter can be explained. _ A
contractor gambles on the cost of material,
and the cost of labor, and on other circum-
stances. If labor and material amount to
just about what he expected he makes a
profit—often a big one —save when he
strikes quicksand where he looked for rock,
or rock where he expected clay, or when a
water-spout or cloud-burst or land-slide falls
unexpectedly on his job. But, of. late, the
wage question has become especially pre-
carious, for Wages Board awards have ceased
to have any binding quality whatever; also,
material has been an even more uncertain
item than usual; and, on top of all, the
Territory is something of an unknown coun-
try. So the contractor has crowded his hat
bitterly over his ears, and left.
THE RUSH.
A gentleman, named John Armstrong Chaloner,
has had a bulletin from Hell. His Satanic Majesty
was seated on a wonderful throne, standing in the
centre of a great audience chamber. The walls of
this magnificent apartment consisted of huge rubies.
Fine diamonds took the Diace of mortar in between
the blocks.
Capital is bound to leave the country if it
hears of this.
Neil Nielsen, M.L.A. for Yass in the
N.S.W. Assembly, who has had a six months’
jaunt to the Pacific Slope with 84s. per day
for “expenses,” is returning there immediately
as Trade Commissioner. Presumably, in the
circumstances, he won’t have the hide to
hang on to his seat. In that case, a by-elec-
tion looms, and there is a sporting
chance that by the time Neil gets up against
his new jo'b, the people who put him in it
may be rather short of a job themselves.
Apropos Booth, deceased. The making of
new sects isn’t quite a dead art even now.
The 19th century produced the Mormons or
Latter Day Saints, the Sal. Army, Dowie —
the stink-pot man of Zion —and his church,
the Mahdi movement, the Senussis, the
Christian Scientists, the Catholic Apostolic
crowd, Father Ignatius of Llanthony Abbey
—he who claimed to have been “ordained”
by Mar-Timotheus, a mysterious party with
no ascertainable address, and Smyth-Piggott,
Areopagite and free lover. Also, there were
others.
“C.R.W.” writes: —
In a par. in The Bulletin it is stated that it is
“not known” why Colonel Gawler, second Governor of
S.A., was called Resident Commissioner. When
S.A. was founded, Cant. Hindmarsh, R.N., who had
fought under Nelson at the Nile, was sent out as
Governor, and James Hurtle Fisher (afterwards
first Mayor of Adelaide and President of the Legis-
lative Council) was appointed Resident Commis-
sioner of Crown Lands. Each was made a master in
his own domain, and relations, which became
“strained” on the voyage from England, soon devel-
oped into active hostility. Matters were brought to
a crisis when a quarrel arose between Colonel Light,
the Surveyor-General, and the Governor, concerning
the choice of the site of Adelaide. When Hindmarsh
reported matters to headquarters, he was told he
“was seeking for an extension of power inconsistent
with the principle of the colony, and that a Governor
of South Australia must be content to receive and
hold his appointment subject to the condition of non-
interference with the officer appointed to execute the
surveys, and to disnose of the public land.” This
snub was followed by the recall of Hindrqarsh, and
the Resident Commissioner was dismissed from office,
although afterwards Governor George Grey exonerated
him. The work of the Resident Commissioner was for
a time carried out by a Board consisting of George
Milner Stephen (brother of Lt.-Gov. Alfred Stephen,
of N.S.W.), who also acted as Governor, and Mr.
George Hall. When Governor Gawler arrived, how-
ever, it was decided to avoid the evils of divided
authority by merging the office of Resident Commis-
sioner in that of Governor. The Board acted as
assistant Commissioners until Charles Sturt, the ex-
plorer, was appointed in 1840. The last Governor,
who was also Resident Commissioner, was George
Grev who, on May 15, 1841, superseded Gawler, re-
called for running too deeply into debt.
SUMMER PASTIMES.
Water h unting at Canberra. (The divining rod.)
Darlinghurst Gaol, which for nearly three-
quarters of a century has housed the great
and small criminals of Sydney, is about to
end its career as a place of detention, lhe
Minister for Public Instruction has an-
nounced that the historic building, with all
its gruesome memories, will be used for
school purposes in the near future, and the
alphabet will be taught in the cells, and the
triangles will serve as a foundation for the
higher mathematics.
The State Land Declaratory Bill, which is
to pave the way for the consolidation of the
N.S.W. State land laws, has arrived at
last. One of the anomalies
the Bill bears up against is
the position of the State
lessee in skirts. At present
a married woman living with
her husband is debarred
from acquiring land, while
the divorced or legally-sep-
arated lady is not so barred.
The new Bill declares that a
married woman is not pre-
vented from taking up a
selection or lease whether
(a) living with her husband,
or (b) living apart from
him. Still, the separated
pair may take up a living
area apiece, while the con-
joined pair may only take
up such an area between
them, so the woman who
has fled still has the pull
over the one who hasn’t fled.
On the 23rd inst., the N.S.W. Farmers and
Settlers’ Association sent a posse of repre-
sentative braves to Minister Trefle with the
following sturdily individualistic requests:
(1) That the State be responsible for the safe
passage of travelling stock.
(2) That the State keep the Queensland tick at a
safe distance.
(8) That the State go to the expense of dipping
all Northern River stock.
(4) That the State fumigate all seed shipped at
Coif’s Harbor.
(5) That the State eradicate the water hyacinth.
(6) That the State protect the farmer from the
Private Enterprise manure-seller.
(7) That the State do ditto from the P.E. wheat
sack-importer.
(8) That the State endow a ’Varsity chair to the
Great Goddess Cow.
(9) That all these things be done without cost to
the farmer.
Trefle replied sympathetically, and the depu-
tation withdrew to search for a good Anti-
Sosh candidate to oppose the Minister at
the coming election.

PEACE IN TIBET.

In ev’ry direction you hear the fierce sound
Of battle and murder —loud shrieks and dull groans ;
Collection-plates, rifles and Suffragettes’ stones
Are whizzing and banging, and crashing all day ;
But up on the Roof of the World they just pray.
The prayer wheels of all are at thanksgiving set,
And they rattle all day
As the Tibetans pray.
How delicious to know there is peace in Tibet!
How delicious to know there is peace in Tibet!
The cable says Ulster is all of a fret;
Nicaragua’s killing and China’s dyed red ;
Some Mexican raiders are serving out lead ;
Then Willis is shoving green Wood out of doors,
Regardless of blither and Liberal roars.
In every dim corner there’s some sort of row—
Except on the Roof where the Tibetans bow,
And scorn the loud wrangles proceeding downstairs,
While whirling off yards of mechanical prayers.
Peace lunatics doubtless these troubles regret;
But there’s hope for their craze
In these riotous days,
For though H —l’s all around there is peace in Tibet.

NOTIONS
The Rudd-Zanders scrap at Sydney Stad-
ium was a very, wild affair, which reminded one of
the Bombardier Wells-Pa lzer outbreak in New York.
In Saturday night’s battle Zanders was thc accom
plislied boxer, the man who had nevei been beaten.
Before he went into the ring Rudd was warned that
he was about to go up against so ? e j;k} ng * t
—a man with a great reputation. Rudd s remarks about
great reputations were beastly straight, and when he
got into the ring he showed he had no respect what-
ever for the goods. He went for that Yankee like a
wild cat. The Yankee sought to box him—and for a
time did it. He outpointed Rudd and bashed him
generously. But the Australian bull merely shook
his head, crowded in close, and showered his blows
so fast that to block them was impossible, the gong
saw Zanders ahead —on points. But he was a badly
battered U.S.A. citizen, and sadly blown with the
pace. The punching machine he was up against
seemed to be as fresh as a plot of morning daisies.
“Stand off and box him!” said Zanders’s mentors, as
he rose from his chair. If he had been given time
Zanders would, no doubt, have asked how the Hades
one could stand off a cyclone like that. But there
was no time. Rudd was already off the ground and
up in the atmosphere, and before he struck the floor
he sent in six blows —every one a possible knock-out,
within dangerous proximity to the jaw. Again Zan-
ders tried to box. He guarded beautifully. Rudd
beat down his guard with one hand, and smote him
twice simultaneously with both fists at least, that
is what' it looked like. Zanders tried to glide away.
Rudd’crowded after him, hittihg with all six fists all
the time. Zanders jabbed Rudd in the face with the
left and uppercut him with the right. Rudd took no
notice, but just smote, and Zanders doubled up and
staggered across the ring. Still he was ahead on
points, thev said. Never in his life had he been so
elusive. lie ducked and dodged, he guarded and
fended, and streaked round the ring like a demented
jim-jam. Rudd • whirled in pursuit, and suddenly,
getting right on top of Zanders, hit him with 24
hands. Zanders spun round, pirouetting like a ballet
maiden, and theri fell—crash. The referee was count-
ing him out when the gong went, and saved him for
an even worse fate —to be made a .holy show of.
Twice he tried to rise, and failed, and his seconds
dragged him to his corner and strove to get him
round. “You ain’t half licked yet, Ern!” said one
second. Ern did not reply. Probably he was too full
for words. In the third round Rudd struck him with
everything at once, and, in a manner of speaking,
threw him away. Only the ropes held him up.
Rudd waved all his tentacles for a knock-out. “Don t
hit him!” yelled referee Scott, and the clamor ended
with the Australian a winner. It was a remarkable
fight. Although Zanders was quite beaten, it does
not count as a knock-out. because the foreign gentle-
man was on his feet to the last. If Rudd would only
take care of himself and settle down to learn boxing,
he would, in the opinion of the best judges and this
writer, be a wprld champion middle-weight. The
light- and middle-weight, section are supplying much
more exciting fights this season than did the heavy-
weights last year. Mclntosh had always argued that
the lighter weights would out-sparkle the heavy ones ;
but as the popular taste was all for heavies he gave
the public what it desired.
If luxury is the deadly thing it is said
to be, it is small wonder Johnson failed to put up a
brilliant display against Flvnn. When the Great
Black One started for Las Vegas, it was something
like a royal procession. The train consisted of three
automobiles and crew, six men to assist the Murky
Object in his training operations, a chauffeur, a
special cook, a valet, and a couple of alleged humor-
ists to keep Johnson amused. The idea of being
stipendiary jester to a nigger' has elements of rarity
about it. Jeffries ran something the same sort of
rig at Reno, and had “play actors” in his camp to
keep him cheerful and bis nervous system in good
order. And when the scrap came, Jeffries seemed
altogether too polished to fight. Johnson is, ap-
parently, going the same way, and will probably
lose his bauble soon unless he gets back to the simple
life.
* * * *
Some time ago the Boxing Commission
which controls pugdom in the State of New York
ukased that Johnson should not do battle thereabouts,
presumably for fear of demoralising the police, or
wrecking the morals of Tammany. And ever since
the delivery of that flat Johnson has been wild to
scrap in New York. As a matter of law, it is some-
what doubtful if the Commission has any power to
stop him, for 1 lie has been guilty of no enormity.
Like the dog, every bruiser is entitled to one bite, and
Johnson, since the Flynn scrap, has been forcing
things. Two big boxing emooriums are willing to
risk it. and the chances are that he will fight in New
York State, and fight the Commissioners afterwards.
These persons are named Dixon and O’Neill, and the
latter, as might be guessed from his name, is full of
war* The N.Y. Athletic Club has made a definite
offer for Johnson and Pa lzer, and O’Neill has spoken.
O’Neill says Johnson shall not slog that night, and if
he fhinks the Cemmissioners can’t stop him, just let
him try-—that’s all. And, according to one day’s
accounts, Johnson is going to try. The next day re-
port's that he is going to definitely retire on Septem-
ber .1. The third morning (Wednesday) . brings the
news that he will depart for Paris, and make it the
bruising centre of the world. Thursday is full of the
information that he is about to take a hand in
theatre management, and start extra-special brands of
caffe in the leading centres of the States first and
the world afterwards. On Friday the real estate
business is his dart for the future. On Saturday he
is going to devote himself to science and art. And
on Sunday the world totters under the assurance that
be is taking on all and sundry so long as the money
is b'ig enough. But it must be big, as he never car-
ries less than £lOOO in his clothes these davs.
Being challenged to make good, he dived into the
caverns and wildernesses of his garments, and dredged
up bills and gold to the extent of $7OOO. Then a
staggered newspaper man reeled away to the nearest
bar. One thing seems very plain—that he is anxious
to fireak his contract with Mclntosh, on the ground
that he does not care for the long, tedious journey
to .Australia, The papers report that since the
Titanic smash he has taken a sudden dislike to the
sea—a fashion in which he is far from exclusive. So
it is just as well that the Mclntosh sent the suave,
debonair W. J. Kelly, with power of attorney to use
the moral suasion of blue paper on the wonderful
nigger. If Johnson sticks to the fighting business, it
is hard to see what else he can do hut come. His
narhe is Mud in the States. Even New Mexico is
barfed against him, ; the Flynn fight having disgusted
the? authorities there. The way Johnson makes
enemies and creates a dislike to boxing is amazing.
It is to be hoped that the cheerful Mclnstoush will
not have occasion to regret bringing the “big black
smdk.e” to Sydney. It would be delightful to see him
lose his championship in the same ring in which he
won it. + '
“Straight-’Un”: Concerning this cataract
of French boxers that is descending upon us, nobody
seems to remember that, three-quarters of a century
ago, boxing had a blazing vogue in Paris. From
Jack Adams, a leading English light-weight, a host
of gilded Gauls had learnt the art of biff, and nothing
was talked about amongst the Parisian exquisites
save le boxe. When the famous Owen Swift arrived
in Paris, a match was arranged between him and
Adams. Swift, the best nine-stoner the ring had ever
seen, had twice killed his man in England. For the
first case he did six months gaol. For the second
he did a “bunk” to France, and his heels couldn’t
be seen for dust. The first fight between Swift and
Adams was a fiasco over a question of fouling. It
was brought off almost publicly in the Bois de
Boulogne, and the papers, and the French Wowsers,
and the Chadbands of Montmartre, raised such a
cackle that the second encounter was arranged with
great secrecy. After a desperate battle of 80min.
Swift won. But the affair leaked out, and Pecksniff,
of Paris, was aroused, and warrants were issued
against the principals and seconds. Adams and the
seconds promptly made off to England, but, as Swift
dared not return there, he surrendered. When he
was sentenced to a smart term of imprisonment, how-
ever, by Justice Heep, of France, he got out on ap-
peal, and also bolted for Britain, stood his trial for
his second manslaughter, and was acquitted on a tech-
nicality. So le boxe became disreputable in France,
and remained under a cloud until quite recently,
when a revival set in.
Although the Sydney Rugby League played
off the final round on Saturday last, the result of the
matches in no way affected the destination of the
premiership. That was already practically decided,
Eastern Suburbs having got so far ahead as to make
overhauling impossible, even had it fallen before Bal-
main. And even supposing Glebe stamped South Syd-
ney under, that suburb would still have been two
competition points behind E.S. However, that fact
did not dim the enthusiasm of the players to any
visible extent, neither did it cause any diminution of
the takings at the gates. Balmain went up against
Eastern Suburbs, and was overthrown in a very fast
and strenuous game by 14 points to seven. Glebe fell
on South Sydney at Wentworth Park, and found it
had a tough job on hand. South struggled like the
Devil, and at the end Glebe just managed to win by
three points (19 to 16), which is a mighty close
thing under League rules. North Sydney was a mere
banquet for the heavyweights of Newtown, who chewed
it up by six points, scoring 11 to five. Annandale
warred with Western Suburbs, and prevailed against
it by 15 points to six. West Sydney is whipper-in.
The progress of Eastern Suburbs has been magnifi-
cent. Of the 14 matches played it has lost only one,
and made victories of all the rest. Curiously enough,
there wasn’t a drawn game in the League competition
this season. It is not a business that lends itself to
draws. The total point score of E.S. for the season
was 230, and the total scored against it only 86.
This was the biggest majority of the year. Glebe,
the runner-up, lost three games of its 14, scored 199
points for the season, and had 83 scored against it.
Newtown, third on the list, lost five games, scored
only 176 points, and had 132 kicked off it. The
scores in competition points of the three leading
teams were 26, 22 and 18 respectively ; so no matter
which way you score the result is the same. The
competition for the City Cup will commence next
Saturday, and rage over three week-ends ; and in ad-
dition to the Cup the members of the team which
wins the final will receive medals.
QUITE A SERIOUS MATTER.
Tommy Burns thinks that Tom Sharkey’s challenge
is a joke, but says that he might meet him if the
financial inducement is good enough. Burns says he
has no desire to participate in one-sided bouts, and,
besides, he might go to Australia at Christmas to
meet Langford.
Of course, the Lang ford- Burns bout won’t be
a one-sided affair.
The Rugby Union’s competition reached
the semi-final stage in Sydney last Saturday, and the
result was two desperate battles, between Glebe and
University and Western Suburbs and Newtown re-
spectively. The postponed match between South
Sydney and St. George was also played off, and re-
sulted in a victory for South by 20 points to 11—•
which is all that need be said about it. It was the
third meeting between Glebe and University, and, as
usual, Uni. went down. All three defeat? sustained
by Uni. this season lie at the door of Glebe; and
they have to meet yet again. The first Jialf saw a
great struggle, though Glebe came out of : it on top
with seven points to five, which was very level going.
But University was done. It went to pieqes—not an
excessive number of pieces, but enough. The Glebe
men crowded on all the steam they could, and scored
13 more points, while ’Varsity could add none. So
the game was won by 20 points to five.. Newtown
made a good stand against Western Suburbs, which
loosed wave upon wave of the fastest and heaviest
forwards to be seen on a Union ground on Saturday.
This mass of hurtling meat and bone —which also had
some brain material stowed away in the caverns of
its head —simply overwhelmed Newtown by 15 points
to nil; but the plucky game played-by the men from
the Dusty Suburb deserved a better fate. In the
competition, Western Suburbs is top of all with 24
points, having got through so far with three defeats
only. Glebe and University have each a drawn game
on the list, in addition to three defeats. This makes
them level in the second line, with 23 points. So
Western Suburbs has got practically no' margin to
travel on. Newtown has 20, Eastern Suburbs 19, and
St. George 12. Below that there are others —cripples,
Primitive Methodists, poultry-fanciers and the like.
The Rugby Union team from the Manly
Superior Public School has put up a pretty record
for the season so far. It has played nine matches,
and not had a single point scored against it, and it
received forfeits from three teams which had no heart
to face it. The total points scored up till Saturday
last were 516, or an average of 57.3 per game to nil.
The highest score was the 97 (to nil) made against
Willoughby, and the lowest 38 (to nil) against
Neutral Bay. On Saturday last it met the Combined
Public Schools of Northern Suburbs, and downed the
confederated team by 54 to nil. An amazing recoicl,
which suggests that the M.S.P.S. is playing out of
its class.
* * *
Tlie Soccer struggle for the Gardiner Cup
reached a curious stage on Saturday afternoon, when
Balmain went up against itself and won by one
goal. It reads drunkenly, but the explanation is that
Balmain entered three teams for that contest, and on
Saturday last Balmain A had to decide with Bal-
main C which would represent the Tattered Suburb
in the semi-final; and Balmain C was outed after a
struggle of great height. In the Association Cup,
Balmain B warred on West Sydney, and kicked it into
oblivion by five goals to one. Balmain holds the
Association as well as the Gardiner Cup, and its
chances of continuing to do so look rosy. West
Sydney was the only dangerous rival (even now it is
running second, with 23 competition points to Bal-
mains 25), and the nearest rival is Garden Island,
with 12 points. In the Rawson Cup upheaval, Syd-
ney, having an easy time with the depleted Navy
team (six goals to nil), is at the top with 20 compe-
tition points. Glebe, though, is only one point
behind, owing to a drawn game on its list, and on
Saturday it upset Newtown by three goals to two.
Canterbury tore up Granville by four to one, which
made no difference to either side, as they are both
out of the hunt, Granville having 12 and Canterbury
omht points only. In this particular riot Balmam is
third, with 18 points—so anything is possible yet.
* * * *
Saturday’s hoofball in Melbourne saw
some tremendous scuffles and the “outing of another
League team—’Wood—from premiership chances, lor
the first time since there was a League, the redoubt-
able Magpies, wrecked and disorganised by bad luck
in having their best players injured, failed to re-
cover from early disasters, and must now drop from
second place to sixth. Superstitious barrackeis put
the disaster down to the committee’s action in omit-
ting the picture of the magpie from the membership
tickets; but this writer opines the said committees
lack of wisdom in selecting promising aspirants had
more to do with it. ’Wood’s chief trouble is a lack
of good forwards ; and, by the irony of circumstance,
the youth chiefly responsible for ’Wood’s defeat by
’Roy on Saturday is an ex-Collingwood junior, whom
the committee refused to place in the senior team.
1-Ie went to ’Roy, and to-day heads the list of League
goal-kickers. In general play ’Roy’s backs were far
too good for the opposing forwards, and the Maroons
marking and placing were superior throughout.
Scor es—’Roy, 65 ; ’Wood, 27. The South v. Carlton
collision was memorable, because of the fact that
the former was a game ahead, and a victory would
assure it of the “minor premiership,” with the right
to a deciding match in the event of subsequent de-
feat. Carlton, however, was out for all it could get,
and by a series of concerted rushes it got a goal
more than the Southerners —seven goals 10 behinds
to six goals 10 behinds. The pair are now equal in
games won, but South is some 120 to the good of
points scored. It has to meet ’Wood next Saturday,
while Carlton has a gift in ’Varsity. _ So, if South
loses or Carlton wins by over 120 points, the latter
may yet head the list; otherwise South will stay
there. For (he remaining two places in the final four,
three teams still strive —Essendon, Geelong and ’Boy.
Geelong, which meets Richmond this week-end, is in
the velvety position that it can afford to lose by as
much as 50 points and still arrive, having scored so
heavily in points throughout the season ; if Essendon
beats ’Roy, it also gets there ; but should ’Roy win,
it must hand ’Don a walloping, worth, at least, 70
points, to reach the select four. Viewing the matter
dispassionately, this writer says the four will be
South, Carlton, Essendon and Geelong ; and he fails
to see that any of the latter three is strong enough
to oust South from final glory. St. Kilda banged
’Don on Saturday—loB points to 50—just by way
of amusement. Geelong scored 94 to ’Varsity’s 50,
and Melbourne acquired 73 to Richmond’s 63.
While these interesting arguments were being pur-
sued, a tremendous episode was occurring on the
North Melbourne ground, where North met Brunswick
in the first Ass. semi-final. The odds appeared to be
pn North, especially on its own ground, but ’Wick,
which had gone off of late, was strung up to concert-
pitch, and played the steady, systematic game that
has kept it at or near the top of the tree these last
few years. For the first quarter the players were
over-eager, and the game was more strenuous than
skilful, but after that the pace told, and the ad-
vantage was not to the swift, but to the man who
used his head. At half-time the tallies were level-
five goals two behinds each. Little had been thrown
away, and everything gained had to be fought for.
On resuming, North made its effort, and in a few
swift minutes looked to have the game won, with
nine goals six behinds on the board. But the latter
part of that quarter, and all of the last, was seized
by Brunswick. Steadily the lead was reduced ; the
Brickies kept the play to themselves, and by per-
sistent attack and skilful transfer of their boots to
where they were most wanted, saved their own goal
and wore down the Northern backs. It was hard, de-
termined work, but, five minutes before the bell rang,
they stood level again—nine goals six behinds all.
For that last wild five minutes both sides threw
defence to the wind, and. strove for the 'point that
meant everything, while the barrackers yelled and
raved and 'blithered. Something or someone must
have burst had the excitement lasted much longer,
but in the midst of the riot a disinterested time-
keeper casuallv rang a bell and the fury ceased, in
a draw. That means a repetition of the, uproar a
fortnight hence.
Auckland is the lock, stock and business
end of Maoriland Rugby football these days, and the
Ranfurly Shield, the outward and visible sign of
Union glory, seems to have made Ilori Grey's old
capital its permanent abiding place. Yet it all but
denarted the oth'w day, when a horde came up from
Taranaki and fell on the city. The horde was re-
pulsed, but only by six points to five, and the city
breathed freely again. In the League game Auckland
recently gathered the scalp of Wellington by 16 to
nil; so in both departments the - place that Kipling
described as “last, loneliest, loveliest,” is top dog
and boss cocky.
*;* * *
Under the usual conditions of mud and
murk England scored a more or less glorious vic-
tory of 244 runs over Australia in the third, last
and only completed Test, which was also the ninth
and last of the Triangular series. On a wicket for
tricky bowlers Australia compared unfavorably with
Fogland, inasmuch as its half-dozen trundlers
(Whittv, Hazlitt, Matthews, Kelleway, Minnett and
Macartney) were not nearly such a dangerous array
as were England’s seven (Barnes, Foster, Douglas,
Woollev, Dean, Rhodes and Hearne). These had,
•among' them, something to suit every possible phase
of the pitch, and the four last named were special
demons. j Gregory lost the toss! Half a-n hour
late (delay owing to rain) Hobbs and Rhodes faced
Whittv arid Matthews. The wicket was doing several
things, apd the star bats could only scratch up 14
runs in 30 minutes before another downpour. Haz-
litt, Macartney and again Matthews were tried in
turn, but the opening pair had taken root. Hobbs
was snatched at 107 for 66. He had been specially
severe on Matthews, who, for once, was erratic.
Spooner came in and gave Hazlitt an opportunity- to
bring off a wildly-sensational single-handed catch.
Fry played the rock for 40 minutes for five. Woolley
arrived to see Rhodes (49 in three hours) bowled by
an unexpected slow one from Minnett. More rain".
Between showers and sunlight the wicket was vary-
ing from dead slow to tricky and fiery. Hearne was in
and out for one, but Woolley gave trouble. Douglas
(first appearance in a triangular Test) made 18 in
50 minutes. Foster went for 19, and Woolley ran
to 62 before Minnett rattled his sticks. First day:
England, eight for 233. Rain delayed the start the
second day until' 1 p.m., after which Whitty and
Minnett got the last of the wickets, and England
was out for 245, including 13 sundries. Australia
had badly required at least one more bowler as a
relief, and Emery would have been the man for the
tricky spells. Australia started on a mudhole of a
wicket, and Gregory tried the experiment of going in
first with lielleway, but Rhodes held him off Barnes
for one. Macartney had made a single when rain
stopped play for 150 minutes, and the shades of
night were falling when business was resumed.
Barnes bowled Macartney for four, and Bardsley joined
Kelleway, and the pair played out time with two for
51. The third day’s Well-rolled pitch soon went to
pieces, when, with a stolidly made 90 on the board.
Woolley became monstrously unplayable. He bowled
Kelleway for 43, caught and bowled Jennings for a
circle, and got Minnett held by Rhodes for another.
Then Barnes chipped in and Bardsley (30 in 105
minutes) walked out. Smith was snapped by his
gloved namesake for six. Matthews and Whitty were
caught off Barnes for two and nought, and Oarkeek
off Woolley for five. Hazlitt was n.o. with two.
The total of 111 included 18 sundries, leaving 93
off the bat, of which Kelleway and Bardsley accounted
for 73. Before the 10th wicket fell there had been
yet another bolt for shelter, owing to rain.
Then the end began. England, with a lead of
134 had a dose of deep gloom. Whitty dismissed
Rhodes (4), Spooner (nil) and Hobbs (32) between
the showers. Woolley fell to Hazlitt for four, and,
when darkness and downpour ended the day, England
had lost four wickets for 64. The fourth day was
the last. The wicket was cracking under a visible
sun, and England required no more. Hazlitt dis-
missed the rest in a few minutes, total 175, of which
15 were sundries. Fry, Hobbs and Douglas made
135 of - the 160 batted runs. Hazlitt captured seven
for 25 (his last five for one run). Whitty took
three for 71. Australia wanted the dry-ground trifle
of 310 to win, but on that fearsome pitch the best 11
bats in the world couldn’t have got them. Macartney
(30) and Jennings (14) were the only double figures.
Kellewav and Bardsley- disappeared for blobs. Sun-
dries seven, Hazlitt five, and Minnett four, were
-the highest single figures—rtotal 65, or 58 off the bat.
Woolley, bagged‘five for 20, Dean took four for 19.
England retained the supremacy by 244 runs. Fog-
land’s first inmngs beat Australia’s two efforts bv 69.
Woolley was the bright particular star of England,
capturing 10 wickets for 49 runs.
* * *
Although Australia went down in the
scramble for “the ashes,” the best batting averages
among the 47 players representing the three coun-
tries, belong to Australia. Warren Bardsley scored
392 runs, at an average of 65.33; C. Kelleway piled
up 360 at 60 runs per innings. Then J. B. Hobbs
(Eng.) comes, on with 387 runs, at 48.37. followed
by i Mayne with an average of 48, and Macartney
takes the next place with 32.83.
The disqualification of Petersham for play-
ing an “ineligible” against Leichhardt has brought
about a deadly evenness in the rush for Sydney base-
ball premiership, and the brethren of Leichhardt
climb on to the box-seat beside University. On Satur-
day ’Varsity pounded Petersham by 10 runs to six.
Leichhardt jumped on the folk of Burwood, and left
Tom Henley’s electors bedraggled by 10 runs to three.
So Leichhardt and ’Varsity have 22 points each,
Petersham 16, and the remainder of the table is quite
inseparable at the other end.
The Yankee lawn tennis push which was
making such an uproar about what it would do in re
the Davis Cu-p this season, last week crept into its
shell and squeaked that it would not. or could not,
come to Australia. So England will be the only
visitor, and a mighty team its team will be, too.
COMPLETELY ERADICATED.
THREAD WORMS IN A CHILD AND
ALSO IN ADULT.
The complete manner in which COM-
STOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM PEL-
LETS eradicate Worms of all descriptions
is strikingly illustrated in the statement
published below. The statement is one
freely given by Mrs. A. Bristow, 37 Regent
Street, Sydney, whose little girl of seven
had been troubled with these parasites, and
also concerning a friend who had been
troubled in a like manner for 20 years.
Mrs. Bristow’s statement is as follows:
“My little girl, aged seven years, was sub-
ject to Thread Worms, which caused her to
Be peevish, irritable and restless* at night,
with a voracious appetite, and I .procured
all sorts of remedies for her, but without
avail, until I saw Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot
Worm Pellets advertised, and my husband
t'dd me to buy them. I did so; and after
she had taken one box and a part of the
second, all traces were eradicated, having
passed great numbers of them. Since then
a friend of mine who had suffered also from
Thread Worms fqr 20 years, enduring much
discomfort, rendering her pale, sallow and
thin and which caused her much internal
trouble, with a feeling, of sickness, during
this time using all sorts of remedies, such as
turpentine and different Worm Powders to
remove them, without avail. At length she
was induced to try Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot
Worm Pellets, and after taking the third
box (following the directions minutely) she
was pleased to find that the worms not only
ceased to trouble, but that all trace of them
had left her, that her health was returning,
she was increasing in weight, and getting a
better color. She cannot speak too highly
of them, and recommends them to all whose
children are suffering in this way.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation tor tne
eradication of Worms in children and adults.

1 Some old inhabitant of Sydney turned up
unexpectedly the other day. The picks of
two workmen, engaged in excavating for the
deep foundations of a nine-storey building in
Clarence-street, knocked in the roof of his
subterranean home quite by accident, and
burst into his slumbers. Two modern police-
men, whose forbears may have been in their
cradles when the old resident was watching
the bullock-teams plan the city streets, came
down and removed the box of relics to the
morgue, and the workmen spat sadly on their
hands and resumed operations. Nowadays,
there is not even room enough in Sydney for
the retiring person who consists of three
small bones.
“O.K.” writes:—
Re the projected Australian National Gallery of
Portraiture of Political Personages, or whatever it
is to be called—-how about the selection .of. artists
or “men on the job.’’ After all, thebe is less room
for grievous absurdity in the official nominations 'of
subjects for immortality on canvas than in the choos-
ing of the local art which deserves encouragement.
Are the paintings to be stodgy and photographic, or
strikingly lifelike by suggestion and innuendo,,or'some-
thing of each ? Will the work be apportioned with
due consideration to the fitness of' certain' artists to
paint certain types of men? Ambrose Patterson, for
instance, did a remarkably clever portrait of his
father, which stamps him as an artist who would
probably achieve a much more, forcible likeness of
Hughes or Turley than of Andrew Fisher. And so
on.

They Want “ IWAN ”
Post Hole Dig'g'ers
in far off Malay!
It’s thousands of miles away,
but worth the trouble.
Fencing with bar and spade is out of date. You’ll fully realise
this in the first few moments of handling an “IWAN” POST HOLE
DIGGER Fences can be built at a surprising pace with this tool —in
fact, compared with the old crowbar way of fencing, the “IWAN”
DIGGER effects a saving of 12 days on a 72-chain job.
Reckoning that posts are 10ft. apart, you couldn’t sink more
than 30 holes (about chains) in a day with crowbar and spade.
But you can sink 120 holes (about 18 chains) in a day with an
“IWAN” DIGGER. In fact, a user wrote us from Yarck (Vic-
toria), saying he had put down 200 Post Holes in a day.
jgh
In addition to the speed, an “IWAjSP’ POST
HOLE DIGGER cuts the hole just the size
for the post, which means little ramming and
a firmer fence. Farmers use small sizes in
boring for water, by adding lengths of pipe
to the bar.
Every Post Hole Digger IS a Post Hole
Digger, but THERE IS ONLY ONE
“IWAN,” and it lias no adjustable parts
to wobble about or stick.

THOMAS A. EDISON, LTD.
(Wholesale only), Dept. 8., 364-372 KENT STREET, SYDNEY.
Ethel Buckley, who is playing in “At Cripple
Creek,” at the Kensington Theatre, London, is
modestly billed as “Australia’s brilliant comedienne.
She is the wife of Entrepreneur George Marlow, and
was a favorite with patrons of the cheaper and
gaudier variety of Shriek in these parts.
Josephine Cohan, leading lady of the “Get-Rich-
Q.uick Wallingford” Co., has a serious heart trouble.
So much so that her husband has to carry her up-
stairs to bed every night at the Albany, where they
abide. Yet she goes on acting cheerily enough.
“Stargazer”: Under the one-man one-seat regula-
tion of the Melb. Board of Health, every patron
in a theatre gallery is to have a space of Ift. sin.
by 2ft. 6in. to his own cheek. This is an extremely
liberal allowance. An ordinary chair is 15in. x
15in., and the average man doesn’t need so much
dumping ground, but Woman, being the sterner sex,
demands a little more. I suggest the segregation of
the sexes in theatre galleries, with individual spaces
marked in accordance with the anatomical require-
ments of each, and a further grading to meet the
diverse needs, thin people in the front seats, thick
ones in the back. This will enable theatrical man-
agers to apportion their space to the best advantage,
whereas the Board’s regulation is fundamentally
wrong. What’s sitting room for John Forrest is a
ballroom for Dr. Maloney.
“Iyles Innison”: In one of his Sydney daily-
messages, singing soul-salver Alexander told how a
sinful theatre-goer—or, rather, a theatre-goer, for
the sinfulness was to be taken for granted—was
dragged back to the fold when nothing short of a
divine, or, in other words, a Yankee miracle, could
have turned the trick. According to the man who
saves sinners through his nose, the Lost Soul was
standing in front of a theatre (which, by the per-
versity of Providence, happened to be opposite the
Tabernacle), waiting for early doors, or his girl, or
some other fellow’s girl, when the boisterousness of
a mission hymn entered his ears, and passed like an
electrie shock into the deepest depths of his soul.
It was the Call. Instead of entering the melo-
drammery, to have peanuts fired at his countenance,
he passed into the Temple, and lived happily ever
afterwards. Better than all, he saved two bob. It
is a pretty story ; but it is apt to get on the nerves
of the average man who mixes his religion with The
Woman Who Did and the villain who becomes an
undertaker’s job in the final chapter. And it’s now
plainly up to Bill Anderson, or Hugh Ward, or Bert
Bailey, to tell an embroidered story about a Wowser
who was standing in front of the Tabernacle and
happened to hear the orchestra doing its darndest in
the theatre opposite. AVith one swift bound he
crossed the street, and bought a ticket, and became a
Different Man. It’ll be a mean, sordid, underhand
sort of story, but no worse than the anecdotes the
Yankee dispenses through his nose.
“Lyre”: The all-too-limited repertoire of Quinlan
only gave 15 operas and that of Melba 12. Yet
this scanty fare included eight operas produced
by both companies: “iraviata,” “Carmen,” “Aida,”
“Lohengrin.” “Rigoletto,” “Bolieme,” “Butterfly,”
and “Faust.” Melba obliged us with “Tosca,”
“Samson,” “Romeo and Juliet” and “Othello.”
Quinlan supplied “Hoffman,” “Golden West,”
“Tannhauser,” “Hansel and Gretel,” “Prodigal
Son,” “Valkyrie” and “Tristan and Isolde.” Are
operatic resources so limited? Only 19 operas by
the two companies. And nearly every opera must,
perforce, be dismal. Glancing at my own recollec-
tions, the charm in grand opera seems most to be
wreathed about such as “The Barber of Seville,”
“Daughter of the Regiment,” “Sonnambula,”
“Norma,” “Don Pasquale,” “Nozze di Figaro,”
and “Don Giovanni.” Of course it is heresy
to mention any English opera, such as “Maritana,”
“The Bohemian Girl” and “Martha,” although the
Quinlans are English. Is there a universal operatic
taste for the horrible? Give us some brightness
next time. Fetch along, at all events, Wagner’s
“Meistersinger” and Verdi's “Falstaff.”
“Cove”: The N.S.W. rocks' push has missed four
lovely dances, invented by the New York hooligans,
hoodlums, plug-uglies and toughs. These boundings
are called the turkey trot, the chicken crawl, the
bunny hug and the grizzly bear. The police have been
trying to squelch them, whereupon a fashionable
terpsicliorean professor gives an opinion that they
can be made chaste as ice and pure as snow, and in-
troduced in high society, which pants, like the
Athenians mentioned by Paul, for a new thing, the
barn dance being decidedly antiquated. The turkey
trot is evidently a variety of this. The professor
thinks the grizzly bear really a thing of beauty, at
arms’ length. He has not yet quite succeeded in
rendering the bunny hug respectable, but he has
hopes.
“Eryander” : R. A. Proctor, the father of the lady
now lecturing in Australia, would hardly ever have
been heard of. outside scientific circles, if he hadn’t
acquired the happy knack of just catching Science
round the waist and waltzing her into the cognisance
of the ordinary reader. His first book fell dead, as
far as the public was concerned. Even after he had
come to be known as a highly readable expositor of
scientific knowledge, he declared that he would have
preferred “stone-breaking on the roads, or any
other form of hard, but unscientific labor that would
offer a modest competence.” He was a tremendous
worker and a wonderfully accurate cartographer.
There is in existence an isographic projection of his
which, within a circle llin. in diameter, con-
tains 324,200 dots, each representing a star of its
proper size and in its proper relative position.
“Amos”: A particularly ancient ex-mummer took
the call that may not be flouted a few days ago.
William Dibdon Bates his name was, and he passed
out at the Actors’ Homes, near Merri Creek, Fitzroy
(Vic.), cetat. 84. He was originally a civil servant,
administering the oath in the Court of Petty Sessions
at Davlesford, and cultivating the impressive delivery
while perjurers kissed the Book. Black Wednesday
came, however, and minor judges, commissioners,
inspectors, auditors, magistrates, coroners, State
prosecutors, engineers, secretaries and civil servants
in general lost their jobs in an hour. Bates lost
his and took to the stage. That was 34 years ago, and
he stuck to the stage, more or less, all the balance
of his days.
A HENOLOGIST AND EGGIST UPON
ART.
The Bulletin’s Poultry Expert writes of
Art:—
Just now there is an eruption or an outbreak of
art in Sydney. In David Jones’s shop there is a one-
man prize pen of champion paintings by Blamire
Young, and in the Royal Art Society’s premises
there is a whole fowlyard of poultry industriously
scratching. The advice of this poultry expert to
the lover of pictures is to inspect the Royal Art
Society’s fowlyard before gazing upon the art of
Blamire Young. If the art-lover travelled the other
way, it is probable that he would stay so long at
the Blamire Young show, and buy so many of the prize
hens that it would not be worth while going on to
Vickery’s various Chambers. It is not unfair to say
that there is more art in Blamire Young’s exhi-
bition than in the Art Society’s whole effort for
this year. For there is only one Blamire, and
the Trustees of the National Gallery, as was
to be expected of the Trustees of the National
Gallery, bought only one picture, and that,
of course, not of the best. And they selected quite
a whole pen-full from the Society. For the Trustees,
like little children, do not want pictures: they
want to be told stories. Alice Hambidge tells them
a sentimental pretty-pretty one, in paint as smooth
as an egg, in her picture of a sick child “With
Longing Eyes.” A. Dattilo Rubbo has, too, his annual
anecdote, eagerly snapped up by the Trustees. “Music
Hath Charms” shows another variant of his groups
of old men, each head painted as if it were the sole
centre of interest. The etchings and the Sid Long
purchase almost justify themse.ves, though why the
Gallery wants another Long, or a Bubbo, when there
is “The Critics” in Blamire Young s saow, can only
be discovered bv a surgical operation on the trustees
heads. By the' way, his new environment is giving
to Long’s'watercolors a firmer sincerity.
The Society is to be commended for having lifted
the average tone of the exhibition, by discarding most
of the lame fowls that d.sfigured previous shows, and
for having adopted the principle of grouping each
exhibitor’s work in a separate pen. J. S. Watkins
asks, or yearns for, 200 guineas for his Silenus
a very tired old classical gent, surrounded by a mob
of rather wooden nymphs, with a garland of flowers
painted realistically aganst the merely decorative
forms of the nymphs. Good painting of the flesh in
spots, but, as a whole, an ambitious and uninspired
failure. The same artist’s “The Black Fur” merely
leaves this Poultry Expert cold. The portrait is flat
and uninteresting, except where it shouldn t be, in
the treatment of the fur. Norman Carter displays
his hard-working, genuine, pedestrian talent in a
worthy panel. “The Holiday” is a delightful example
of his landscape work; “The Blue Dress” is a bril-
liant impression; and the portraits are solidly and
satisfactorily done, but lacking just the necessary
spark of imagination. His gentleman playing bowls
indoors, on a grey carpet, is brilliantly yet coldly
done, and his other portrait is just the kind of
official straight portrait that every Public Personage
and Municipal Winder-up of Gas Meters ardently
desires. There is not a single fault in it that any
alderman could put his paw upon. But in his ambi-
tious “A Summer Afternoon” the composition is dis-
turbing and the values strained. A year or two in
Europe would mean much to Norman Carter ; and his
work is worth the experiment. Will Ashton could be
certified by Dr. Chisholm Ross as being obsessed with
the idea that he can paint. So pasty is his sea and
sky that “The Wet Moon” is obviously a misprint for
“The Wet Mortar.” W. Lister Lister has done what
is annually expected of him : he has covered an area
equal to the side of a hen-house with a colored photo-
graphic treatment of bush and seascape, any square
yard of which could be sawn off and made into just
as interesting a picture. It seems a pity that so
much industry and technical ability should go to the
production of mere acres of paint. It is a character-
istic of the Society’s members that most of them
can paint a small picture well, as, for instance, W.
Lister-Ditto does, but boggle when they become ambi-
tious. So James R. Jackson’s landscapes, especially the
grey “Settler’s Home,” is worthy work ; but his- big
canvas, “Sisters,” while superficially interesting,
lacks the simplicity of treatment that could only justify
his scheme. Bruce Robertson, in his “Salt Boat,”
offers one of the best pieces in the show. The fiercest
panel belongs to Joseph Wolinski, whose three por-
traits seem as if perpetrated by a scene-painter, and
a rather enthusiastic scene-painter at that. His picture
of “The Molonglo” (70 guineas) has interest because,
presumably, it is like the place, and shows that
much-lied-about river as a series of shrinking water-
holes. Percy F. S. Spence exhibits a number of
smoothly photographic pictures, chiefly of horse. He
can paint a horse, but not a picture round a horse.
There is in this later work of his an unimaginative
hardness and a finality that tells in the first glance
all there is to tell. The consequence is that his work
gets no second glance. His “Decorative Panel” is,
more or less, Watts. There is a great public for this
sort of painting, but this Poultry Exoert needs some-
thing less obvious. Probably that is why he is a
Poultry Expert. Mention must be made of Stella
Macnab’s “Marietta,” most promisingly done.
In the water-color hen-roost there is a delightful
assortment of Minns and Hilders. Arthur J. W.
Burgess gets some pleasing results in his seascapes;
and there are yards of Lister-Ditto, some of which
are worth many miles of his oils. Several of A. J.
Fischer’s landscapes are admirably observed, and
Charles N. Worslev presents some foreign scenes that
are technically delightful. Charles E. S. Tindall’s
“A Trout Pool” is the only one of his landscapes
that escapes from the ordinary. The boobv prize is
handed to A. J. Daplyn for his small “Studio In-
terior.” If that is the interior of his studio it
somewhat explains.
On the whole, a good show, but the impression left
is that it is a tired show. Many of the exhibitors
have been doing the same thing for the past decade:
it is depressing, even to a Poultry Expert, not to be
able, each year, to hail with delight the obvious pro-
gress made by one or more of the exhibitors.

Why does Odol absolutely supersede
all other preparations for cleansing
the mouth and teeth ?
Because
of its remarkable Dower of
suffusing the entire oral cavity with
a thin but thoroughly effective anti-
septic coating which maintains its
protective influence for hours after
the mouth has been rinsed with it.
While tooth pastes and powders can, at the best, be
effective only during the few moments of application,
Odol continues to exert its antiseptic and refreshing
powers, gently but persistently, long after use.
It is this lasting effect that gives to daily users of Odol the
absolute assurance that their mouths are permanently protected
against the processes of fermentation and decomposition which,
if not guarded against, inevitably destroy the teeth.

whether I should be able to rear him.
Now, through taking Scott’s Emulsion,
he is a new child, full of life and vigour,
and his health and condition are truly
remarkable.” Airs. K% M. Bidlock, 158,
Dowling Street, Sydney, N.S. W. 4.8.11.
A MOTHER’S REGRET
“ My son George was always susceptible
to chest colds. He obtained relief from
the first dose of SCO IT’S Emulsion. 1
regret 1 did not try Scott’s Emulsion
years ago; I would have saved a lot of
suffering and anxiety. ” Mrs. L. Langford,
22, Walter Street, Paddington, Sydney,

TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfuly
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover

Brisk: One of those mild little stories
which elderly spinsters retail to each other, amid a
fusillade of giggles, over the 11th cup of tea....
Bi-Yellow: Ghoul that you are, you attempt to
exhume the bush hospitality discussion, and push it
into these columns. Have some decency. The thing
has been dead a matter of months only. .. .5.0.5..
War rhyme is leaden, but not in the right way....
G.L.B. (Fiji) : Can’t publish the sketch. Your MS.
is really villainous. Curious that a humane person
should be such a ruthless destroyer of eyesight....
Phoenix: Might suit an evening paper.... Saw-
dust K.: Both fail S.: It is a deep
and unexplained groan C.F.S.: Don t ask
for a criticism. The Religious Editor, to
whom it was presented, is now kicking the gin-case
on which he sits round the office. The Bulletin s
Supreme Wowser has just hurried out \yith a bottle
to buy him some spirituous consolation... .G.E.:
Poem received. You are young, and may recover. . .
Bernard S.: Not for us Soma: It makes no loud
and splendid appeal for admittance. It doesn’t even
whine and scratch at the basket. . . .M. (M.L.) : Er
thanks. If we remember rightly, that jest was
printed in our own Abo. page some months ago. Our
feelings are those of the suburbanite who is invited
at the front door to buy his own lawn-mower, which
he last saw in the back garden. Can you explain?
Hermit: We’ll do without it Stewart G.:
Typing is fairly g00d.... Bill: All students of the
methods of the Chapzanderites agree that the hymn
is mightier than the Word.... Daddy: “I could tell
some funny yarns about Hamlets,” say you, and you
supply as futile a brace of samples as we ever read.
....Frenchman: Never heard of any such work....
Hazel AVood: Cheerful bit of verse with an idea, but
more suitable for a religious publication. .. .It.W.L.:
Yes, keep it locked up until it is old. It is danger-
ous to have a young thing of that sort about the
premises. .. . Kiskobillion (or something like that):
Your verses are worse than your handwriting, and
the Devil and your brimstone-deserving soul know
how bad that is Alfred: Plenty of solemn effect
without repeating anything. How’s this for solemn-
ity ?
And T said what awful fate
By sailors is endured,
Thank God that I am not
A captain or a steward,
But when my end shall come
I hope it is in peace
And not in a stuffy birth
On the raging seas.
J.A.A.: “Delights of Shopping” is a tedious yarn at
best. Also, your style is sloppy and your typing
is hoppy, and we don’t like your copy in any
way whatsoever. .. .J.D.G.: You have some sense of
the music of words. Might improve. .. .De Pro-
fundis: Handwriting like yours ought to keep you
permanently in a profound place. Still, we are
glad to have your assurance that “you found much
food to think upon,” and we like your use of the
verb to “cray.” It is a valuable addition to the
vocabulary of midnight. . . .C.P.C.: “Roses and Rue”
very slight subject and imperfect verse-craft. .. .
M.R.L.: Yarn about fowls and hatpins does not thrill
U5....M.H.: The jest about the belted earl might
raise some sort of a laugh. But after all, it would
be merely a picture of Bill looking at Jim, and a
memo, below setting forth that Bill said something
to Jim, and that Jim made a remark to Bill in
response. And this world is full of Bills, Jims and
remarks... Boko: Political, personal and social items
should reach this office not later than Monday.
Wild Cat, theatrical and sporting news, also libels
and religious items shouldn’t be later than Tuesday.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
H.F.T.: The man whose brother was dead isn’t the
mirthful subject you seem to take him for G.D.:
Picture of a vicious-looking female with spears in
her hat, telling a larrikin that a person not present
is “a cow” has no charms for us...Gorn: Rejected
with scorn and contumely, likewise reprehension,
denunciation, mockery, contempt, the cold shoulder,
the glassy eye, the metallic laugh and sundries —
especially sundries. .. .AVill Mac: He isn’t of the
slightest interest to man or beast. .. .Stanley Cross:
The staff smothers its feelings, and returns your
contribution in dead silence. .. . L.L.: The first man
who had that iron constitution which was liable to
rust was Tubal Cain, a blacksmith and a man of
might in the days when this world was young....
F.AV.H.: It isn’t a joke—it’s a diabolical outrage,
and you run a risk in sending it from an adjacent
Sydney suburb. Those sort of quips should be shot
at a suffering newspaper from the midst of a can-
nibal-infested country N.McN.: To be candid
with you, the three children in your picture look
like a gnome and two untidy devils. The other
pictures also suffer from certain drawbacks E.
Paterson: There are some good features about your
picture, but it would take a Polar expedition and a
detective and a bloodhound to discover the joke.
“Orient” : The last pigtail has gone from
London. It was that of the major-domo
to the Chinese Ambassador. Although over
40 years old, he had an exaggerated respect
for his father in China, and wrote to him
last year begging permission to cut off the
thing that flew out behind him m a high
wind. Dad wrote back, “Never!” Later,
the major-domo forwarded a second appeal.
Dad wrote back, “Yes! Me dam fool. All
Lepublic.” So the good son hewed off his
back hair and joined in the march of pro-
gress.
Two out of the three R.C. Archbishops of
Melbourne have been Cork men: the first,
Dr. Goold, and the last-appointed, Dr.
Mannix. The two Corkers have been
Presidents of Maynooth College, where the
“secular” priests for Ireland are trained
and ordained. Most of the “friars” go to
the Continent. Dr. Mannix was born in
1864. When he comes to Melbourne he will
live in a brand-new house in Brunswick,
close to Royal Park. Dr. Carr will con-
tinue to live at the big stone Palace on
Eastern Hill, close to St. Patrick’s Cathe-
dral, built by Dr. Goold. Maynooth Col-
lege is 15 miles west of Dublin City, and
was built in one of the first years of last
century. It was founded by a Protestant
British Government to keep the young
clerical students at home, instead of mixing
with revolutionists on the continent of
Europe.
“F. 8.”: The Bulletin recently published
a pretty bit of verse, by Bernard Ingleby,
on the beauties of Brisbane. This is how
Mr. Tearoe, an American civil engineer,
summed up that city recently: “It is only
your glorious climate and the superabund-
ance of sunshine that you enjoy that saves
you from a fearful epidemic... .1 have been
bathing in coffee for a fortnight your
roads are and in an atrocious
condition of repair,” etc. Tearoe then
recommends Brisbane aldermen to go and
take* a few lessons from Bundaberg—the one-
time Kanaka town. As a deadly insult, this
iust about takes the cake.

SOLD AFTER. FOUR YEARS for £s2—Cost New £6B ss.
21 QUINTON ROAD, MANLY, July 26, 1912.
The Manager, Messrs. Beale and Co., Ltd., ANNANDALE.
Dear Sir, —You will be pleased to know of the very great success we have
had with the piano we purchased from you some four years ago.
You are probably aware that we were residing for some 12 months in Suva,
Fiji Islands. The climate of that place is always considered enough to wreck
any musical instrument, but I am pleased to say that our Australian-built Beale
Piano was as good at the end of 12 months as the day it left Sydney ; in fact, its
success was so much talked of that, on making up my mind to return to Sydney,
a Suva gentleman offered me a price very little short of its full value, which I
accepted. I intend in the near future to place an order for another Beale Piano,
as I am convinced, after four years’ trial, that they are the last word in pianos,
and under colonial and tropical conditions have no equal in the world. Wishing
you success, I am, Yours, etc.
(Sgd.) J. H. SMART,
late Supt. Engineer, Fiji Shipping Co., Suva.
P.S. —I may state that my piano cost £6B 55., and I got £52 for it, which,
I think, was pretty good, after about four years’ use. —(Sgd.) J.H.S.

The Message of Sanatogen
No preparation of its kit 4 has ever achieved such
m reputation as Sanatogen.
Many causes have contributed to this unpre-
cedented result.
Pre-eminent among them is the constant prescrip-
tion of Sanatogen by the medical profession which,
as a body, has awarded it the highest praise. More
than fifteen thousand doctors have written in the
most enthusiastic terms to describe the benefits they
have obtained from the use of the preparation
which The Medical Press end Circular states “has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundred-fold.”
Everyone knows now that it gives
To the Sick—Health
It does this by its power of revitalising the
nervous, vascular, muscular, and digestive systems,
wnich it rapidly restores from a condition of depression
to one of normal action. By virtue of its composition
—pure milk casein in chemical combination with
organic phosphorus, an essential constituent of the
brain and nervous system—it feeds the brain and
ne ves, it improves the condi’ion of the blood, it helps
the stomach to digest other food, and it thereby develops
and strengthens the muscles. In this way it gives
To the Weak —Strength
and that delightful feeling of returning vitality which
tells the sufferer that he has conquered the disease
which had conquered him, and is once more on the
road to health, and the possibility of taking up his
life again where he had laid it down.
Sanatogen, however, does even more than this.
It has its message for those whom disease has not
touched. Everyone is capable of increased vitality and
vigour. By feeding the vital centres Sanatogen gives
To the Healthy —Vigour
so that work becomes a pleasure, toil becomes enjoy-
ment, and the whole system takes on a feeling of
buoyancy, alertness and energy which is as delightful
as it is unusual,
merits have not only been eulogised
by the medical press, and by the medical profession,
but have also been endorsed by hundreds of the bes>
known men and women who have testified to the
cures it has Wrought in their cases.
Sanatogep may be obtained from all chemists.

So far as the writer knows, there has never
been an inspired policeman. It is even
doubtful if there was ever a great police-
man. Somehow the job doesn’t seem to
attract bright minds; and the wages of
catching sin (in Australia, at any rate) are
generally low enough to be scorned by a
high-class laborer. The average cop is a
man of brawn and courage, who loves a very
steady job, and the fear and respect of the
populace. To a big man of the right tem-
perament—say, a stolid descendant of Flan
of the Shannon or other remote Irish kings
—a policeman’s job offers great chances of
happiness. To the big man of ideas it
offers none. So the force contrives to be a
band of worthy, sociable, underpaid heavy-
weights who throw the fowl-stealer and kneel
on his chest with neatness and despatch, but
are left “completely in the dark” with great
regularity about larger matters. The Vic-
torian Hop in particular suffers greatly
from darkness. During the reign of the
lingering O’Callagiian, he has been in a
chronically unlighted state. And the fact
that he himself approved greatly of the
choice of O’Callagiian, when the late
Ciiomley retired, seems to be one reason
why he should not be heeded, now that he
is urging that the Commissioner’)? place
should be filled from within the service, on
the ground that “it would take an outsider
some years to get acquainted with a mere
fringe of his duties.” With all due respect
to the Victorian Hop l —and Heaven knows
that his due is a great deal! —he appears to
be in error in regarding his plain job as a
sort of mystic art requiring a long and faith-
ful apprenticeship. Whatever it is, whether
science, art, trade or hobby, it has not yet
produced one illustrious individual. If John
Hop the Great ever gets to the Victorian
Commissioner’s chair, the odds are that he
won’t step off the beat. He will have to
come from outside.
From “Demos” :
How the alleged “comrades” do mutter, to be sure,
when a State member pulls out of the local Assembly
to battle for a place in the national Parliament!
Yet a first principle of Democracy is that there shall
be no restrictions placed upon the choice of the
electors. Two or three Victorian Labor members
are announced as about to contest Federal seats at
the next elections, and the announcement is evoking
the usual groans of disapproval from the customary
narrow-minded crowd. The same sort of groans were
heard when Anstey left State politics to unhorse
Hume Cook, and when Roberts reached out for the
Adelaide seat in the Reps.; and when Long and
Jensen, of the Apple Speck Assembly, set successful
sail p'ter a Senate and Rep. seat respectively. The
only State in which there appears to have been no
objection raised against State Labor members who
contest Federal seats is Queensland. In all the others
there seem to be a good many alleged Democrats
who practically insist that Federal seats shall only
be given to candidates who have had no previous
Parliamentary experience, while State members, many
of whom have pioneered the movement in their
States, must repress any natural inclinations they
may have to represent their fellow Australians in the
natie al Parliament. The army in which the
highest rewards were given to the rawest recruits
instead of the veterans would pretty soon go to
pieces, and the general who was foolish enough to
make such an unjust and ridiculous proposal would
be promptly, and deservedly, hanged.
That this parochial and (particularly for alleged
Democrats) foolish attitude is not confined to a
mere handful of unofficial Laborites is shown bv the
fact that, in at least one of the States (Tasmania)
a Labor member of the local House must obtain the
consent of the Executive of the Political Labor
League before contesting a selection-ballot for a
Federal seat. The full strength of this rule becomes
apparent when it is explained that the members of
the executive mentioned may be personally inter-
ested, as possible (or impossible) candidates, in seek-
ing to block a particular State member’s aspirations
towards a Federal seat. So far as the writer is,
aware, this amazing rule has never been enforced;
still, its mere appearance in the printed eon
stitution of the League amounts to a reproach.
That a Political Labor Council should be endowed;
with power to refuse its sanction to an entirely new
aspirant, whose past record renders him notoriously
unfit to carry the banner of the party, is understand-
able, provided such aspirant has the chance of pre-
senting evidence in his own defence, and none of'
his judges are personally interested. But to give
the P.L.L. executive the power of vetoing a man
who has an unblemished record as a State member
looks like a careless handling of explosives.
Not long since, a group of Melbourne
matrons were discussing the merits of a cer-
tain lady, who panted to be a clubmate of
theirs. One of the critics objected to the
candidate, on the ground that she had once
been a teacher. (Presumably the objector
was a lover of ignorance.) The majority
of her listeners seemed to regard this as a
valid objection. But one valiant female,
who knew that the objector had once been
in a shop, and recollected that .she had “mar-
ried in the trade,” cried loudly : “Well. Mrs.
Ragges, I am surprised to hear you talk like
that! I always thought a teacher was
superior to a shopgirl.” Then the teacups
rattled like the family skeleton in a high
wind, and there was such a cyclone of talk
that you couldn’t have heard an elephant
drop.
The other day, a Melbourne shop window
containing a display of Japanese silk de-
lights, included a pink table cover with a
map printed very clearly in the centre. It
showed, with a wealth of detail, the familiar
outline of our Australia. Chrysanthemum
Land must know our unguarded continent
very well by now.
Extracts from the Book of the Proverbs
of “0.K.”: —
The means to suicide is a matter of taste. Many
people prefer champagne.
A good woman is merciful to her beast. After
all, it was her fault that she married him.
The Wowser who goes to Heaven has nothing more
to Wowse about.
Circumstances alter faces.
Pay no heed to the young widow who says she has
had one good husband and doesn't want another.
She is sure to take another. Nothing succeeds like
success.
When a woman listens to you with rapt attention,
you are talking about her dear little self, as a rule.
In death all men are equal, but their tombstones
are different.
Most people die as they have lived, insensible to
the troubles of those about them.
Always speak of people as you find them, but don't
take particular trouble to find them. If,you do you
may find them out.
One bad turn deserves medical attention.
A woman is rarely charming when she knows her
own mind.
Two blacks make a piccaninny.
Artistic people shape even their opinions grace-
fully, and form no resolves at all. Resolves are'
ugly, stodgy things at the best.
There is honor among matrons. How loyally they-
conspire to denounce the frailties of their respective'
husbands.
Virtue is a deep dissembler. Nobody suspects a,
paragon among wives of ever wishing she were a<
perfect devil of a widow.

Superfluous Hair in Australia.
ITS INCREASING PREVALENCE TROUBLING
LADIES. A WOMAN’S CLEVER DEVICE FOR
MEETING THE DIFFICULTY.
For some unknown reason the growth of superfluous
hair on the face and arms of comparatively young
ladies is becoming far more frequent than it used to be.
Women under 30 have been noticed with quite visible
hair on the chin or upper lip; and after 30 it is
the exception, rather than the rule, for the face to
be entirely free. Thick hairs on the arms are, especi-
ally to brunettes, a great source of distress when in
evening toilette.
There is no sort of depilatory which can be used
without aggravating the trouble ; for the moment you
destroy the hair it begins to grow again, and, of
course, the tip of the new hair is as thick as the base
of the old hair, and each use. of the depilatory makes
the growth coarser.
By an ingenious invention, perfected by the well-
known Edinburgh specialist, Mme. Tensfeldt, ladies
can destroy the hair roots themselves, each in the
privacy of her own room, with the certainty that no
hair can by any physical possibility grow anew from
the same root. The new self-treatment apparatus
works by electrolysis, and is used by thousands of
ladies at home, and compared with repeated sittings
at a beauty-parlor it is really much more economi-
cal. It does not give any shock, nor can the current
be felt. A slight prick-—less marked than the sensa-
tion which would be caused if the hair were pulled
out —is all that is noticed ; but the root is dead for
all time! The apparatus costs only £5 55., carriage
paid; and when done with can be returned within
six months, when £1 ss. will be paid out in exchange
for it.' The address is Mme. Tensfeldt, 120 a Princes
Street, Edinburgh, Scotland, to whom remittance
should be made payable.*
COULD HARDLY BREATHE.
“Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy was the means of
curing my cold and bronchitis. I had pains and
tightness in the chest until I could hardly breathe. I
am a member of the Lodge, and got some medicine,
but it had no effect,” writes Mr. T. Johnson, 243
Harrington St., Hobart, Tas. “I then tried Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy, and one bottle completely
cured me.”*
Under the seductive title of “Spring Fashions for
1912,” the toniest business picture book that ever
was devised and printed in Australia has just been
put in circulation by Buckley and Nunn, of Melbourne.
The only imprint it bears is B. & N., wherefore the
handsome booklet, fastened with pink ribbon, is un-
justly suspected of a foreign origin, but its local pro-
duction is vouched for. Mostly the pictures are
dreams of impossibly fair women in distracting gowns
and hats, with letterpress details re quality and
price. The visions grow more undressed as they go
along, so to speak, and the last of them are merely
lower limbs clad in bedroom mysteries. The ordinary
illustrated catalogue from a drapery emporium is not
to be mentioned in the same breath as this artistic
appeal to the clothes-sense of sassiety. And all done
in Melbourne!

PIKE BROTHERS LIMITED, Brisbane
IN BANANA LAND
How the Australian capitalists yearned
for cheap colored labor in the v early days
may be gathered from the fact that the San
Francisco Evening Bulletin of 1862 an-
nounced that the “Government of Queensland
will give employment to 500,000 negroes at
105dols. per annum with food and clothing
in that new and rich portion of Australia.
Soon, also, their services will be in demand
for raising tobacco, rice, sugar, etc.” The
Brisbane Courier rose to contradict the -
dreadful announcement, and said that it pro-
bably sprang out of Towns’s assertion that
he intended cultivating cotton by means of
runaway American negroes. But advertise-
ments calling for colored labor for Queens-
land appeared on several occasions in U.
States and Canadian papers.
In view of Governor Macgregor’s recent
and frequent utterances on hygienic njatters,
it is interesting to recall that when Gover-
nor of Lagos (West Africa) he tested cer-
tain theories he had advanced in Papua' re
the villainies of mosquitoes. From Lagos,
Macgregor wrote: “We shall be able to dis-
pense with the quinine and mosquito-proof
rooms shortly. A few months ago this
house was infested by mosquitoes, and Lady
Benton died in it of black-water fever. I
had fever last year every day for two or
three months. By destroying the breeding
grounds of mosquitoes we have all but killed
them off. That is going to the root of the
evil. It consists in draining, in filling in
swamps and puddles, in removing all empty
tins, etc. That rids one of fever, of the
pests themselves, of mosquito wire-gauge
and quinine. There has been no case of
fever in my house this year.”
The imported Renard road train, of which
so much was expected, has been a howling
financial failure to date. The original cost
was £4106. It was recently tried between
Inglewood and Texas, and the figures were:
Working costs, £957; earnings, £209. On
to the wrong side has to be added £2762 for
fitting up the road to take it. The Govern-
ment makes a resolute attempt to appear
delighted with its disastrous new acquisi-
tion, but few are deluded thereby. At latest
advices, the contraption was in hospital' at
Ipswich having its' case diagnosed by mind-
specialists. ,
“Kobbi”: Queensland has grown tired of
the unintelligent Bumble, who wilfully ob-
structs the business of shire councils and
other Bumbleisfic institutions. The latest
Local Authority Act empowers the Gover-
nor-in-Council to throw him out. How the
Governor is to say when a member is
obstructing is not explained. Another new
arrangement proposed by the measure is
that, when a local body consists of an even
number of members, half that number shall
be deemed a majority. The thing makes my
head, ache. I want to know which half?
THE BEST OF REASONS .
OFFICER: “How is it you and your brother did not turn rip for parade last night?"
“ Please , sir, we couldn’t come. It was our bath night!”
“Hugh Enden”: There’s something radi-
cally wrong with Queensland Labor. For
years it has been deploring strikes and lock-
outs, but whenever a chance came along, it
went out on strike with all the enthusiasm
of a cow’s father entering a glassware, em-
porium to devour a red tablecloth. The
present Industrial Bill gives Labor an oppor-
tunity to stand by its avowed principles. It
is a better measure than the Arbitration
Act of the Cbmmonwealth in that the pen-
alties are fixed on a higher scale. Still, it
is understood that the party is against the
Bill, on the ground that it doesn’t include
rural workers. The omission is, no doubt,
a pretty serious one, though it is scarcely a
justification for losing all the other advan-
tages offered. But Queensland Labor has
always been something like that. A Bill to
Establish the Millennium might get turned
down on the ground that no proper provision
had been made for pensioning off the Devil.
What has happened the old-time navvy?
A few years ago the navvies' pay-day was
synonymous with a gigantic spree; to-day
the spree is almost extinct. On a Queens-
land extension, recently, the navvies banked
i 409 on one day (£3 7s. per man), and the
pub scooped in not a single copper. Reason
—there wasn’t any pub. No licenses are
now issued on new extensions.
“Kobbi”: Fifty years ago Queensland
sent ■ some cotton to J.B.’s World’s Fair.
According to the British press, the stuff
“left behind every competitor,” “astounded
everyone”; and “the fabulous price of 2s.
od. a lb.” was offered for it. To-day the
newspapers are saying much the same. Yet
in all the years that have elapsed since then,
we have not in our own country manufac-
tured much more than a pocket-handker-
chief. Amazing is the deliberation with
which Australia advances.
Again the Tory farmer clamors for
State Socialism. Richard Bach, agri-
culturist of Oakey, told the Meat
Commission in Brisbane: “They (the
middlemen) do as they like with us
with the pigs. The producer does not
get what he should for his pigs. The pig
industry is just a gamble. The Government
jCould help the man _on the land by doing
something on the lines of the provincial
Government of Alberta, which built a bacon
factory for them, on condition that the
farmers guaranteed to provide a certain
number of pigs. This idea could be benefici-
ally acted upon in Queensland.” Next elec-
tion, Richard Bach will probably vote, as
usual, for the Denham middleman Govern-
ment, one of whose Ministers recently told
a deputation that a State produce depart-
ment “wouldn’t suit me.”
The overland telegraph line from Laura
(the terminus of the Cooktown wire) to
Cape York has features of its own. It was
laid out ’wayback in ’66 —which is even
earlier than the first Asiatic discoloration
observed in these parts. The building of the
electric support, with its six repeating sta-
tions, ran into something over £50,000. Costs
were big in those days, and especially in this
instance, because the stations were practi-
cally stone forts with loopholes for rifle fire.
Binghi grew his bad habits very thickly in
the region. Even to-day, the officer of the
Works Department who makes the periodi-
cal inspection of the line takes an escort
with him when he rides along the 550 miles
of wire.
He-cups and She-cups!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a simple sort of cuss, with soft, brown, wavy
hair,
Which parted in the middle to a spot high up and
bare,
And in his soft, brown eyes to match, deep gleaming
seemed to be,
I met him in a patch of scrub, and thus he spoke to
me:—
“Oh ! tender-hearted friend,” he said, “my plight is
full of pain.
I swallowed down a hiccup, and he won’t come out
again.
That happened just two years ago, and, though I've
often tried
To lure him forth, he shakes his head and raises
Cain inside.
“I’ve been to ev’ry hospital in every town I know ;
I’ve called in ev’ry doctor from the Bight to Chilla-
goe ;
And I have but one hope they say, unless they
operate,
And that’s to find a shiccup to become my hiccup’s
mate.
“The sex call is so strong, they say, the hiccup will
come forth :
So I have travelled far and wide, by South, and East,
and North,
In train and coach, or else on foot, with tucker-bag
and tent,
To find a spinster shiccup with a matrimonial bent.”
He stopped and looked a monument of human misery.
“It’s not a bad old gag,” I thought, “to score a
modest spree.
So “Buck up, man! buck up!” I said, and led him
from the scrub,
“We’ll find a nice young shiccup at our little way-
side pub.”
Then joyously he went with me, and babbled by the
way:—
“A shiccup for my hiccup, and we’ll marry them to-
day.
They’ll have jim-jams for children and” — with
visage stern and grim
A warder from the madhouse came and got a grip
on him.
He struggled fiercely for a, time, then sadly drooped
his head,
And turned his soft, brown eyes on me, and very
gently said: —
“Don’t grieve about my'failure, friend; I see the
hand of Fate.
We had no minister to join the pair in holy state,
And so the jim-jams would have been all illegiti-
mate.”
QUEENSLAND.
MILKY WHITE.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 24, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
We haven’t got over it yet. Our bound-
less but grass-grown Babylonopolis is as
silent and void of all social delight as the
place where the corks once popped when the
last reveller has gone to bed, or died, or got
married or something. Search where you
will, you can’t find even a little piece of
Governor to make you glad. With all their
aides and splendor, our late guests are scat-
tered over far-distant landscapes, and even
our own Wee hasn’t stayed with us to help
us through our period of recovery.
The MaCgregor vice-regality, with the
Bryces, Forsyths, and the Foxton aide, are
touring in the Western Downs. One Macart-
ney, M.L.A., is helping them in their rural
campaign. Until their return next Fri-
day, Arthur Morgan has hold of the steering-
gear, and is working overtime as emergency
man in the interests of George V.
Despite the depressing local conditions,
Ida Clowes, only daughter of the Clayfield
medico, has found sutlicient energy and cour-
age to declare her intention of renouncing
spinsterhood in favor of John Webster, who
dwells in your parts. I reach a languid hand
of congratulations to John and Ida.
Baby Forrest, youngest daughter of the
popular E. 8., of that ilk, left for your city
by the Wyandra to-day. From Sydney, she
and her pa will be wafted over the rippling
blue to Fiji, where a smiling parent will
deliver his sole remaining female child into
the arms of 6ft. 2in. of manly dignity. The
said tower of flesh comes to you when you
call it Southwell Lord.
On Thursday evening, all the sympathy
we could muster was called out by hearing
of the sad plight of Dave Bowman, the Labor
leader. He was suddenly assaulted by the
old trouble which necessitated a trip to
England a few moons ago, and is now in the
tender keeping of the Mater Misericordiae
Hospital. The attack came on in the Assem-
bly, which afterwards adjourned. Pbor
Dave was told by the doctor people that, he
would do well to leave the field of politics
severely alone, but, like most champions, he
finds it hard to drop the familiar game. I
was glad—and so, I believe, was the whole
community—to hear that he is much easier
to-day.
In spite of our lassitude, some of us have
been able to sit up, like Samson, and take a
trace of beef-tea at intervals. On Wednes-
day, Mrs. A. G. Lawley, who has been in
charge of her brother’s archiepiscopal, bache-
lor quarters, redeemed the paste-bdard ac-
cumulated during her stay in these parts by
distributing layers of tea and buns. She is
shortly to accompany the hon. and rev.
gent, whose name she adorns, to the country
where fat, little, smiling Buddhas look out
over a landscape of dwarfed citron trees
feathery chrysanthemums, and well-drilled
patriots. ~r u
Dancing has been attempted once or Iwice
during The' week, but purely as a pifs|gte
enterprise. On Wednesday, Dr. and Mrs.
Brockway, and their muscular daughters,
entreated some dozens of pals do the - mazy
business, in their private gymnasium;On
Thursday, Miss Carter did something simi-
lar in the ancestral halls of - Nunnington,
and Mrs. Grundy looked sorrowfully through
her greenest spectacles at an array of masks
and dominoes, which seemed to hint at un-
speakable depths of frivolity.
Sibyl Arundale, who is described by the
gallery-ite as a “bosker,” was the guest of
honor at a tea-party given by Mrs. E. B.
Wareham and her daughter on Thursday
afternoon.
Other hostesses of this weary and dishev-
elled week were Mrs. A. J. Cotton, Mrs.
Donald Cameron, and Mrs. Voss, of Rock-
hampton. Food-taking was conducted by
each of these, in turn, at Eschenhagen’s.
Mrs. Walter Harding also entertained a
number of her dearest friends yesterday, at
her pretty little home in Toowong.
Lalla Miranda sang here on Thursday, and
quite a lot of people didn’t mislike the per-
formance pretty well. The Exhibition Hall
—always a bad place for sound—presented
a vast area of unpeopled seats, and the
voice of the maker of melody reverberated
through the emptiness, and got lost about
the roof, whence it descended, making unex--
pected assertions yesterday or next month;’'
The alleged artists who accompanied the;
lady would have saddened a professional
grave-digger. If Lalla could contrive to
strangle the flautist, bury the pianist
(whether alive or dead mattereth not one
whit), dodge the horror of the Exhibition
Hall, and allow her free soul to warble
itself forth in the theatre, we might all
entirely change our views anent her and her
melody.
In lively hope of a joyful resurrection
from the slough of inertia into which this
world-centre has fallen,
Yours breathlessly,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

The Wine of the Barley.
FOR countless generations Ale has been a favorite beverage.
It was drunk In Egypt 3000 years before the Christian
era; it was known and appreciated by the ancient Gauls;
it was the favorite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and
is still the premier drink of the most alert and active peoples of
the world. It was the drink of the lusty and strong, the “doers”
in the history of the past.
Cascade Ale is akin to the ale of old England, for it is rich
in the qualities that promote health and strength. That its merits
are appreciated by those most competent to judge is proved by
the rapidly-growing sales in every part of the Commonwealth. 4
Sold at all first-class hotels and stores.

A FASCINATING AUTHOR
The Complete
Works of Guy
De Maupassant
Issued to Subscribers only
... by ...
The Standard Publishing Co. Pty., Ltd.,
Publishers of the Complete Works of
Shakespeare, Balzac, Dickens, Scott,
Thackeray, etc.
IT is a literary event of more than ordinary im-
portance that The Standard Publishing Co. are
able to announce the issue to subscribers of a
complete and admirable translation of the entire
Works of Guy De Maupassant.
Henri Rene Guy De Maupassant is by well-nigh
universal consent the greatest short story writer in
all literature. It was when Baudelaire translated
the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe that the French
attempted to achieve mastery in one of the most
difficult forms of art.
Maupassant and Gautier alone improved upon their
teacher. But Gautier’s chief fame rests upon his
poems and his romances. Maupassant produced a
series of little masterpieces, which are unsurpassed
for ingenuity of conception, for perfection of detail,
and for an almost miraculous adroitness in the pre-
sentation of character and incident within the tiniest
limits. The unwinding of one of his stories is one
of the fascinations of literature.
His stories deal with innumerable details of the
human comedy as it presented itself to Maupassant’s
ever-observant eye. He has given us strange tales of
travel and adventure of weird mystery and awesome
dread, and of the pure comedy that is never far
absent from human circles.
Only a few of these masterpieces have found their
way into English print. Strangely enough, this is
the first collected edition which has ever appeared in
England. It has also been left for the Publishers to
make this edition more complete than the authorised
French edition.
This Standard Edition, in fact, contains many
stories and sketches which have actually never been
republished in France, and are now for the first time
rescued from the oblivion of the magazines in which
they 'originally appeared.
THE GENERAL. FORMAT. —The Standard Edition
is an endeavor to produce a set of the Complete
Works of De Maupassant, which will conform to the
best dictates of style and art.
THE ILLUSTRATIONS.—There are thirty through-
out the set, from original drawings by noted Freneh
and American artists. A number were executed by
De Maupassant’s friends —who declined compensation
—contending that it was an honor for them to show
their admiration in this way for his works.
THE PAPER.—The paper used in this edition was
specially made, and is, therefore, of one color and
quality throughout. It is a pure antique, with
deckled edges.
THE PRINTING. —The printing was done from
original type and not from plates. This ensures a
special clearness. A new font of French Elzevir
type, bold and elegant in design and easy to read,
was specially cast for and used in this edition.
There are good margins to every page.
THE BINDING. —-It has been our aim to secure
simplicity and quiet elegance in the bindings. The
books are handsomely bound in Blue Vellum Cloth,
with distinctive brown and gold title labels.
ANALYSIS OF THE SEVENTEEN
VOLUMES.
IN THE FIRST FIVE VOLUMES the author pic-
tures, with marvellous skill, the virile novelty of
country scenes, and the comedy and tragedy under-
lying the whirl of Parisian life in fashionable draw-
ing-rooms, in studios of art, in greenrooms of opera
and theatre, and in the Quartier Latin of students
an THE Se SECOND SECTION OF FIVE VOLUMES
contains the Romances which caused Tolstoi to hail
De Maupassant as the supreme realist and romanoe
writer of his century. Here are found the daring
explorations of his subtly intelligent mind into the
emotions of the heart of womankind.
THE THIRD SECTION OF FIVE VOLUMES em-
braces the Dramas, Poems and Travels, the last-
named sparkling with gems of description—Meisson-
nier-like pictures in words —of Spanish, Italian, Cor-
sican and Oriental life. The shorter Romances are
also included.
THE FOURTH SECTION contains stories belong-
ing to no one particular phase of life, unless it may
be human passion. Love and laughter, tragedy and
tears run side by side in these two volumes, the last
of the series.
AN APPRECIATION.
Elbert Hubbard writes:—
“This man never wrote to please the rabble. He
wrote because he had a message for the world, and
because Divine Energy forced it through his pen.
De Maupassant wrote with the conviction that in
life there could be no phase so noble or so mean, so
honorable or so contemptible, so lofty or so low, as
to be unworthy of chronicling; no groove of human
virtue or fault, success or failure, wisdom or folly,
that did not possess its own peculiar psychological
aspect, and, therefore, demanded analysis. If occas-
ionally some intellectual pigmy, after reading,
screams in falsetto, please remember, spontaneity
and mediocrity are never kin. A WARNING: Those
of you who find enjoyment in blue-milk brain-wander-
ings should never seek De Maupassant. You will
be disappointed. You will not be able to digest nor
assimilate the strong elixir of his mind, so it will
curdle in your gullet—then it’s you for mental con-
stipation.”

We have prepared an illustrated prospectus of our
Standard Edition of De Maupassant. This will be

“Ricardo”: J. Critchell and J. Raymond
are the authors of a new English book on
frozen meat. The pioneer seems to have
been James Harrison, of Geelong (Victoria)
for the Australian trade, but the Frozen
Meat Fair of Novgorod, Russia, is of much
longer standing. So was the mammoth, pre-
served 10,000 years in Spitzbergen ice, and
the dogs ate him. The authors of the book
just mentioned declare that Harrison was
“the first to recognise the enormous wealth
untapped in Australian frozen meat.” He
was born in Glasgow, in 181 G, and emi-
grated to Sydney in 1837. Was in journal-
ism. Migrated to Melbourne and worked
for Fawkner, who started the Geelong Ad-
vertiser, and planted Harrison there, in
1840. Later he became proprietor. He used
to set up his leaders like Tait, of Colling-
wood, without the trouble of writing. Be-
gan experimenting witli meat freeze in 1850,
at an ice factory he built on the banks of the
Barwon. The records of the London Patent
Office show lie was years ahead of all
rivalry. Geelong regarded him as a crank.
Removing to Melbourne he became Age
editor. Took a shipment of meat to Eng-
land, hut it failed through some hitch.


And Burning. Sores Like Boils AN
Over Body. Parts of Flesh Raw.
Could Scarcely Bear Clothes On.
Nearly Worn Out When He Tried
Cuticura Remediesand Was Cured.
“About four years ago I broke out with
sores on my arms like boils. After two
months they were all over my body, some
coming, and some going away. In about
x
six months the boils quit,
but my arms, neck and
body broke out with an
itching, burning rash. It
would burn and itch, and
come out in pimples like
grains of wheat. I was in
a terrible condition; I could
not sleep or rest. Parts of
my flesh were raw, and I
could scarcely bear my
clothes on. I could not lie
in bed in any position and
rest. In about a year the
sores extended down to my feet. Then I suf-
fered agony with the burning, itching sores.
I could hardly walk and for a long time I
dould not put on socks.
“All this time I was trying everything I
could hear of, and had the skill of three
doctors. They said it was eczema. I got no
benefit from all this. I was nearly worn
out, and had given up in despair of ever
being cured when I was advised by a friend
to try Cuticura Remedies. I purchased
Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and Resolvent, and
used exactly as directed. I used the Cuticura
Remedies constantly for four months, and
nothing else, and was perfectly cured. It is
now a year, and I have not had the least
bit since. lam ready to praise the Cuticura
Remedies at any .time.” (Signed) E. L. Cate,
Exie, Ky., U. S. A., Nov. 10, 1910.

If you Would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS.
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair=Orowlng Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
X am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the. idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip,'l fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a, few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

The Inky Way
“R,F.H.”: Andrew Lang, who died the other day,
was one of the great army of men who never got
there—?albeit a writer of the utmost ability and
energy. He did a little of everything. His trans-
lations of the Iliad and the Odyssey are among the
few really great prose translations in the language.
He wrote every variety of verse—grave, gay, sport-
ing, sentimental, satirical and political—and most
of it was good. Romance in all its aspects was
dear to him —witness his volumes on Jeanne d’Arc
and Mary of Scotland. And in the midst of all this
he wrote various books on Homeric research and
criticism, wherefore the Moderns look on him as one
of the damned, who believe in the existence of the
bard himself. He did a huge series of fairy books.
And then, of course, he contributed regularly to the
magazines and reviews. In his leisure time he fished
and played golf with A. J. Balfour. A remarkable
man—scholar, poet, prose writer, historian, sports-
man, and great at so many things that he was really
great at nothing.
A curious book, called “From Theatre to Music
Hall,” is just published in London. It is written by
W. R. Titterton, and it is calculated to send the
reader into titters. Its object is to “account for the
weakening of the dramatic sense in modern England,
and to explain the enormous importance of the
music-hall, and the desperate necessity of maintain-
ing it as a means of popular expression.” Seeing
that the London music-halls, barring a few excep-
tions, are paying dividends of 20, 30, and even 50
per cent., there doesn’t appear to be anything desper-
ate in their situation. Most of the" theatres are
also fairly prosperous. So what has Titterton to
worry about? Here is a sample of his style:—
“How shall I describe her —that happy, healthy,
boisterous, magnetic coster girl! How convey to
you that she is all that Chaucer meant; all Rabelais
meant; all the comic Shalcspeare meant; that in
her splendid frankness, her hearty laughter, there
is no touch of the luscious and the impure!”
This eulogistic extravagance is applied to Marie
Lloyd, who is supposed to be “Queen of the English
Halls.” She wears the most gorgeous of frocks
and warbles the most thrilling of ditties, making
them thrillier still by her winks, her gestures, and
on-the-spur-of-the-moment gags. In spite of the fact
that she “tops the bills,” Marie was not chosen to
sing at the Royal command performance in the Lon-
don Palace on July 1. Perhaps the committee of
selection feared lest Marie should blurt out some
Rabelaisian remark that would cause consternation
in the Royal box, and bring the oerformance to a
premature close, with all the dukes fleeing in con-
fusion under a press of canvas.

From an acid contributor: The anti-national Bris-
bane Courier devotes half its space to exposing the
viciousness of Andrew Fisher and his Ministers, as
contrasted with the really tedious virtuousness of the
other party. The rest of the space is given
up to photographing some of the ugliest people in
Australia; or, if they aren’t, they should at once
take some action for damages. My impression is
that the Courier is secretly preparing a work on
“Racial Degeneracy,” and these photographs are to
provide the illustrations.

That old Sydney pressman, M. H. Donohoe, was in
Spain lately, and the editor of the London Daily
Chronicle sent him this telegram: “Money being
paid into account. Let me know what are your
plans.” This is how Donohoe received it: “Maoneay
Beina pait Itto accout let use kunu nevat ae yong
plasn.”
THE BONEYARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It snuggles in the corner on a shelf,
By itself ;
’Tis fraught with fate and mystery and doom—
With the harvest of your years, all your laughter
and your tears,
Your record from the cradle to the tomb,
For the uses of the Editorial Room.
It really is a casket of the blest
And the best;
(I’m speaking from a pressman’s point of view) ;
’Tis “The Boneyard” or “The Morgue,” and a man
may “put on dorg”
Who knows it holds his personal review ;
The record of the deeds he —didn’t do!
Aviator, liberator, regicide
There abide ;
Beauty-actor, social purist, divorcee;
Barrister and bigamist, tyrant and philanthropist,
And the rebels who have trod the weary way
That lies between the kissing and the clay.
If you should be a celebrated man.
Then you can
Be sure that your obituary’s there;
That the sub. will mark “Release,” when he hears
of your decease,
On the proof that shall your worthiness declare
To a populace that really doesn’t care.
Yet should it only happen that you are
Worth a par.—
Just a “Personal” to mehtion your demise—
Then you cannot enter there, for there is no room
to spare
A column for each citizen who dies,
Or the advertisers could not advertise!
Do they wonder how the paper got the news,
Who peruse
The long and faithful note of your career?
Nay, there is no need to worry, for it was not in
a hurry
That they bore you to your journalistic bier:
They had you cold, in type, for half a year—
Or even longer, friend, for this is true:
That if you,
For a paper that's expecting you to die,
Have your life’s laborious story starred in headed,
leaded glory
(That you may not disappoint it on the sly),
You’ll find that Death has suddenly grown shy ; .
For no “obit.” was ever written yet,
You can bet,
But its subject took a further lease of life,
Thus adminst’ring a snub to the kind, considerate
sub.
Who did not want to telephone your wife
For the details of your sordid, early strife.
So, if you would be worthy of the rhyme,
Die in time
To save the current news from going stale;
Cash in and quit the game at the apex of your
fame,
Or else the sub. will rage like half a gale
At adding further details to your tale.
He’ll bring you up to date, against the clock,
With a shock
Of curses from the printer in his ears
(The stone-hands standing by), just because you
chose to die
At the ripe old age of eighty-seven years,
Instead of in your prime, among your peers.
’Tis done! And people “learn with deep regret”
(You’ve been set
In time to catch the forme and get to press)
How ill the State-could spare you; and yet, how
little care you !
The comps, will charge their dues for you, I guess,
And on the bulk there’s just one galley less.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad
to hear of a simple and scientific device which will
restore your hearing, no matter how old you are.
There is no mystery or secrecy about it; we describe
it fully and explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and in the
same way you may use this sound magnifier as an
aid to weak hearing. But, unlike spectacles, the
Wilson Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and
comfortable. You can’t tell you are wearing them.
No one else can, either, because they are not seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off
them—the strain of trying to hear dim sounds.
What a blessed relief to have done with that
tiring strain !
Being made of the purest and softest Para rubber
they cannot be felt, even when the head rests on a
pillow. For the same reason, a blow on the side of
the head will not hurt the ear. In fact, they pro-
tect the ear, the tender inner parts that are so
senstive, from cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing
sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why these
facts are true, and why the Sound Magnifier restores
tlie hearing, we give an illustration of one as it lies
in the ear. You will notice that the Sound Magni-
fV
tier is shaped
like a trumpet,
and so con-
veys even the
faintest sounds
right to the
natural e a r-
drum. Being
of the softest
rubber, it can-
not hurt the
ear. It fits the
orifice of the
ear with preci-
sion and com-
fort. The di-
vision that
runs across the
mouth is to al-
low the remo-
val and inser-
tion of the
Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
Th e shape
of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has
been chosen
after years of
experience a s
the best adapt-
eel to carry the taintest sound ri &u „ „„ Lllt
natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not only
trying to have people shout at them, but it hurts
the ear-drum. When age comes the ear-drum some-
times gets thickened, or loses its tightness, and
shouting does not act properly on it. It only
makes a confused and tiring noise. But the
Sound Magnifiers concentrate the sound in the best
spot for perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-nerve
completely, or were bom deaf, we cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could do that, in spite
of some of the absurd claims made to-day. But if
you can hear the faintest sound, do not despair.
You will never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters' to show you from deaf people in
Australia and New Zealand, who have been cured,
and you can be cured, too. You may wear the Ear-
Drums day and night, and take them out whenever
you wish. Children can wear them (we have spe-
cial sizes for children from six to twelve). Even
a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they
are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover and
also an inserter. After the first pair is ’>y'ight you
may purchase a single drum at any time for Bs.,
but the pair you get at first will last quite
two. years. Do not ask for a trial pair. We do
not send them out on trial, and so they are never
secondhand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent you at once, with the fullest
instructions. Don’t delay, but have, the cojnfort of
good hearing as soon as you can.

The Righteousness Brigade.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Chapman, in his address, pointed out that
policemen must of necessity be interested in
righteousness. Ife pointed out that no half-hearted
measures were possible. If a policeman at a street
intersection had only half his heart on the traffic
there would be disasters. No man had so much in-
fluence as a soundly-converted policeman. If a dozen
members of the force went in uniform from church
to church, what an influence they wou d exert! If
there were a position outside of the minister’s that
he would covet for the exercise of his gifts it was
the lot of the policeman.—News item.
THE constable upon his beat

And, on these wintry nights, his feet
Are most susceptible to cold—
Cold feet on any man will tell;
To constables they are plain II—11!

Looms up amid the August storm!
The constable stands mute and still,
Observing with a rain-blurred eye
The near approach of Burglar Bill,'

A gentle push, a crack, a rush —
And Bill is lying in the slush !
Dear friends, ’tis all a sad mistake —
Alas ! that such strange things should be!
Inis outrage will forthwith awake
The Christian Tract Societee !
It was no burglar, after all,
The slop had jammed against the wall!
“Know, ruffian !” gasped the injured wight,
That I am not a burglar bold,
Who haunts the watches of the night
To lay up dross, and moths, and gold—-
Nay! —mine is not the burglar’s trade —

The Painter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A MEDICAL friend of mine advanced
an ingenious theory the other day.
He held that irresponsibility was a
disease of the brain, and could be cured by
operation. “Fetch me a Bohemian,” he said,
“and let me chloroform him, and I’ll convert
him into a practical man with one wave of
the hand-saw.” And the idea brought back
the memory of Piston.
I have known many irresponsibles, but
Piston was the most unaccountable one that
ever lived. And he had brains, as all these
Bohemian failures have. Incredible as it may
seem, Piston was a Scotchman. There was
a distinct smell of Aberdeen about his accent.
Scotland exports more human botches than
people imagine. Occasionally a Carnegie
succeeds, and on a mammoth scale ; and lo !
the whole porridge-eating breed takes shelter
behind Andrew, and claims a share of the
glory.
What brought Piston from Glasgow to
Perth, Westraiia, is neither here nor there.
In Perth he pawned and painted, and that’s
the long and short of it. What a vivid re-
collection I have of the first time I saw the
Painter. It w T as raining like Sheol. The
climate came down in solid junks ; and three
waterspouts wrangled with one another as
we came out of the bar. There were no
cabs within coo-ee, so we waited. It was
Saturday afternoon. There were four of
us—three journalists and an electrician. I
was the man of dynamos.
One of the journalists laughed suddenly.
“Hello, here comes Piston.” And across
Hay-street, in a diagonal fashion, came a
melancholy figure. It was the Painter. He
wore a thin alpaca suit that clung to him
like the rags round a drowned suicide. His
legs were as thin as Yale-lock keyholes, and
a sheaf of colorless hair hung dismally down
upon his shoulders. A ragged moustache
dribbled moisture at each extremity; and
the rain ran through his hat and down
behind his spectacles. A large, damp port-
folio of -water-colors made up the Painter’s
armament. One could tell that they were
water-colors, because the tints were soaking
through their scabbard.
The Painter passed before us. The four of
us shook hands with him simultaneously. He
was the kind of forlorn brother that no man
could help embracing. The Painter shook
the dew off himself. “Damn it,” he said.
“I’m so pleased t’ see ye. Have ye got
thruppence?” We had; and we took the
Painter in and played the fluid Samaritan
to him.
Some weeks passed, and I had almost for-
gotten the bedraggled Titian. One day,
however, when I was fixing some ’phone
wires on the fourth floor of a Barrack-street
building, an unmistakable voice quavered
up. “I’m so pleased t’ see ye,” the voice
said. Then it added, “H°ve ye got a
shullin’ ?” It was Piston. He had seen me
from the other side of the road, and had
clambered up the anaconda of a ladder. He
had a portfolio under his arm—lie always
had.
After that, Piston became a personal
friend. He could paint splendidly—but bis
thirst was still more splendid. His life was
b perpetual peregrination from studio to
studio, and from pawnshop to pawnshop.
And his little wife, Mary—with what heroic
fortitude did she put up with her vicissi-
tudes ! May the gods be good to all women
who are married to Bohemians.
One day, four or five of us clubbed to-
gether and bought Piston a tailor-made suit
of clothes. For a week, the Painter was an
outwardly improved man. He looked quite
fine in his new rig; and his legs did not
obtrude their thinness in such a pitiable
fashion. Then, turning into Wellington-
street with my tool-kit one afternoon, I
encountered the same old alpaca Piston.
He had pawned the suit of tailor-mades, and
had sold the ticket for 9d. He was hopeless.
Piston had spasms of luck, though. Just
about this time, old Harper hired him at £5
a week to paint pictures for the Ozone Hotel.
The job couldn’t have fitted Piston better —
from his point of view—if it had been turned
for him in a lathe. lie commenced work at
10 a.m., as a rule, and knocked off at eleven.
Harper used to get furious; and expostulated
with Piston, what time the latter packed up
his implements. Piston had one stereo-
typed reply to these exhortations: “I’m
finished with pictures for the day, thank
YOU.” Then he would go into the front
bar and drink himself peacefully into ob-
livion.
When he did work, however, he worked
well. And Harper knew it. I was sent !
down to the renovated Ozone to fix up the
electric light switches, and therefore I saw
a good deal of Piston. So did a lot of other j
fellows. Troops of journalists used to come
out on the tram, in order to see Piston in- !
dulging in the dissipation of work. Some-
body distracted Piston’s loosely-tethered at-
tention one day, while he was painting a
mountain scene. Whilst he was looking the
other way, a varlet stuck a red postage
stamp in the middle of the painting. Piston,
short-sighted and half-tangled, mistook it
for a blob of pigment. “Damn it,” he said,
“I’ll make a sunset of you.” And he did ;
using the postage-stamp for the pivot of the
picture. His mountain scenes and sea-
scapes were liable to be turned into sunsets
and moon-risings at a moment’s notice. An
extra drink would alter his entire artistic
plan ; and what looked like a bush-scape at
the beginning would end up bv developing
into a lighthouse or a picture of still life.
Toward the end of the contract, Piston
commenced to paint a portrait of Harper.
Harper was an ordinary sort of a man ; but
he saw himself —and his portrait—through a
roseate lens. Harper would sit for the
Painter by the hour; preserving the same
wooden expression in a miraculous wav.
When Piston dropped the palette, and went
off on a jag, Harper’s grief was extreme.
He was afraid that Piston would get under
a tram-car, and that the precious portrait
would never be finished. But the adumbra-
tion of Harper proceeded steadily. A day
came when the picture was virtually com-
pleted. A touch here and there was all it
needed.
While Piston was in the bar. Harper took
half a dozen acquaintances into the impro-
vised studio, in order to view the canvas.
His acquaintances were mostly of the pub-
keeping variety, and were not strong on art
criticism. But the likeness was so good that
a corpse could hardly have failed to express
its approbation. Piston wandered in after
a casual fashion while the pub-keepers were
praising his work. It irritated him to think
that his production had been submitted for
judgment to a lot of ignorant beer-caliphs.
So he took up his brush and palette in an
aimless style, and stood reflecting before the
picture. Harper looked on, with his thumbs
in the armholes of his waistcoat, thinking
that Piston was about to apply the finishing
touches. The Painter lifted his brush sud-
denly. “Damn it,” he said, “I don’t like
it,” and with half a dozen swift strokes he
painted Harper’s wooden countenance into
oblivion.
Harper went mad with rage, and died
shortly after. His friends all attributed his
death to Piston.
But the Painter remained cheerfully im-
provident. He wandered around the streets
of Perth with his everlasting portfolio of
landscapes and sunsets, seeking a buyer, and
almost always ending up by pawning his i
wares. In time, every pawnshop in Perth I
became converted into a miniature Louvre, j
Piston’s masterpieces were hung in a pictur-
esque fashion amongst ole clo’ and cast-off
portmanteaux; and vivid sunsets gleamed out
from amidst a medley of hats, books, revol-
vers and old boots. The pawnbrokers of
Perth became full up of Piston. They
wouldn’t take his pictures at a gift, let
alone make an advance on them. Baulked
in Hay, Barrack, Wellington and William
streets, Piston finally appealed to a Chinese
pawnbroker in Murray-street. The Chow-
cum-Hebrew “uncle” held up his hands in
horror. He had 59 sunsets already, and
would take no more. So Piston pawned his
spectacles for 3d.
That completed the Painter’s downfall.
He could not paint without his spectacles ;
and his sunsets were a drug in the market
in any case. But his brave little wife stuck
to him through thick and thin. The visits
of many bailiffs did not abate her love, and
many turnings-out did not sour her heart.
Some day, a great writer will tell the true
tale of the sufferings of poets’ and painters’
wives, and the world will wonder what inde-
structible material their loyal hearts are
made of. For their lives are brown wastes
of misery, stippled with a few rare specks <.f
pleasure.
I don’t know what became of Piston.
Just after the pawning of the spectacles, I
got typhoid fever. I was many weeks in
hospital; and when I came out the Painter
and his family had disappeared. The boys
had “weighed in” to the Painter’s wife with
an occasional five bob; but one day their last
refuge became vacant, and Perth knew the
Painter no more. It was reported that a
relative had left him a legacy; and that be
had gone back to Glasgow, or Jerusalem, or
somewhere. I don’t believe it. He couldn’t
keep the cash long enough to get to the
shipping-office. Poor, improvident Painter.
Some day I expect to spot his bony figure
in the street; some day I expect an Aber-
donian voice to sav: “Damn it. I’m so
pleased to see ye. Have ye got thruppence?”

On FARM, SHEEP-RUN,
and CATTLE-STATION
Zam-Buk is invaluable.
The true value of Zam-Buk is nowhere
more readily recognised and highly
appreciated than among the busy toilers
on farms, sheep and cattle stations and
outback selections,
where the workers —
who are, as a rule,
fifty, one-hundred or
t w o-h nndre d-miles from
medical assistance—need a
balm with soothing* and
healing properties, combined
with the power of cleansing
and “sweetening” wounds,
and preventing “ gathering,”
festering, inflammation,
poisoning and disease, such
as Zam-Buk ONLY is.
1
j
*(
It may be at the plough; in the workshop; while splitting, fencing,
branding, or shearing ;or in the homestead itself—the hands receive nasty
cuts and burns, and the body and legs painful bruises and abrasions, which
require the immediate soothing, healing, antiseptic and germicidal powers
of Zam-Buk to prevent any tendency to festering or poisoning, and ensure
prompt and perfect healing, thus enabling the worker to continue his
work without inconvenience, or loss o£ time and money.
Ex-Station-Manager's Praise.
Mr. W. G. Paine, ex-manager of Wandovale Cattle-station, Queensland, and now
residing at Baker Street, Charters Towers, (Q.), has proved the value of Zam-Buk—and
incidentally the wisdom of always having a pot handy—for a deep wound caused through
being horned by a bull, and writes : —“Some two years ago I was manager on Wandovale
Cattle-station, and I found Zam-Buk invaluable for many kinds of injuries sustained
during my occupation. On one occasion I was horned in the leg by a bull, the flesh being torn open
and causing a nasty wound. We fortunately had some Zam-Buk in the homestead, and Immediately
applied a dressing of the balm, and within a week the wound had healed right up.
“ At another time I got a half-hitch around my hand with a head-rope while branding calves, and
the strain broke the bone in one of my fingers, and splintered another. I was 120 miles from the
nearest doctor, so thought I would again try Zam-Buk. I used to rub the balm in every night, and
although I worked all day, in three months my fingers were quite knit and healed. I intend never to
be without a pot of Zam-Buk handy for use when occasion may arise.”
The home that always keeps a pot of Zam-Buk handy is furnished with an ever-ready
healer and perfect skin-cnre, and with the one reliable remedy for winter eczema, any
scalp sores suddenly appearing among the children, the obstinate piles and had legs of the
worker, festering and swelling from blood-poisoning, and any burning, irritating and
bm-Buk
itching sores, which are
among the daily perils
of this season. Zam-Buk
is obtainable from all
chemists and stores,
1/6 and 3/6 per pot.
EVERY HOME
NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

My Pet Bores.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I LEAD a hushed, secluded life
Some forty minutes out of town,
Where vacant lots and cows are rife,
And to the sea a road goes down.
One day is like another there
Except when one is wet —one dry;
There Peace does up her tousled hair
And watches far, white sails go by.
And there I live and work in peace;
From Monday morn till Friday night
I burn the fruitful midnight grease,
And find in everything delight.
But oh! the week-end brings a flock
Of cawing crows to my abode;
Long, long before I hear their knock
I hear them coming down the road.
With tales of sad bereavements, debt,
Misfortunes dull and ailments dire,
They fly to me, on boredom set,
And perch on chairs before my fire.
They peck my cake, they sip my tea,
And tell me who it was died last;
Of Uncle Jim’s insolvency
And Aunt Eliza’s gumboil vast.
Then someone else their father knew,
Some five and forty years ago,
Is going blind, or bald, or blue.
(The facts they don’t exactly know.)
I sigh when I’m supposed to sigh ;
I groan in chorus with them all;
Lacking the pluck to simply fly,
I go and curse them in the hall.
Then trays of food I order in,
And force upon them drink, and sit
In that accursed ring and grin
Like God’s most futile hypocrite.
I dream at times of rising up,
Of pouring forth my white-hot rage,
And dashing down the lying cup;
But —somehow I can’t reach that stage.
Often I’ve pictured them aghast,
Have seen them shrinking from my
door
Before the vitriolic blast,
Vowing they will return no more.
But in my bursting throat and breast
I bottle up my rage and scorn,
Speak fair to them, give of my best,
And round them positively fawn!
And when good hours have run to waste,
And wildly hoots the final train,
I sadly bid them all make haste
And urge them to come hack again!
I’m mad! That fact I’m firm upon!
But o’er this point I tear my hair:
Can I be madder when they’ve gone,
Or maddest when I’ve got them there?

Gratitude.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ m r OU know what gratitude is,” said
William Liddle to me as we sat in
his office surrounded by the cases
of zinc, silver, lead, copper and gold speci-
mens which represented, in many instances,
the sole assets of a company in 140,000
shares issued and paid up to 15s.
“Yes —I suppose it’s the recognition of
the solid sense of the man who has appreci-
ated our value sufficiently to believe we are
worth helping.”
“Certainly not,” said William Liddle ner-
vously jerking his little black moustache
into new aggressiveness in two pomaded
spikes. “It is the proper thankfulness to
the man who has proved his superiority and
our helplessness by his assistance.”
“As you please. And this rather better
recognition of the relative positions of the
benefactors and the beneficed is dictated by
a recent experience of ingratitude, is it?”
“Yes, it is,” said William Liddle, “though
how you dropped on that I don’t know. I never
mention any wrongs, least of all a wrong
done me by a man I have once called friend ;
but in this case it is different. The ingratitude
was so black that it relieves me of any justi-
fication for silence. The world should know
it. I’ll tell it to you.”
Thus nominated and elected as “The
World,” I silently accepted the position, and
William Liddle, having viciously spiked the
atmosphere with his starboard moustache,
drew the lapels of his frock-coat primly
over his knees as if he were a Wowser lady
in a bathing suit seeing a bad man approach
along the beach.
“You know Charles Dubbin,” he said.
“Well! he boasted that he started in the oil
line with one drum of condemned fish oil in
an outhouse, and as sure as you’re here
he’ll end up in the outhouse without the oil.
He’s an ignorant, illiterate bounder from
the east end of London, and he struck Aus-
tralia in a ship that unfortunately made a
safe landfall, and what I want to know is
why aren’t there more rocks in Bass
Straits? That’s the trouble for scoundrels
like that dirty, fat-headed, illiterate sneak —•
the Australian coast hasn’t enough rocks on
it.
“I was introduced to him just after a
good lunch. Good lunches are a mistake.
If a man were to lunch on hard biscuits and
a bottle of sodawater without the gas, and
perhaps a slice of tomato —so that you
would keep saucy enough not to tolerate
being ruined by your office-boy eating the
petty cash—then a man would never make
friends like that English blighter in the con-
demned fish-oil line. But such rich lunches
as soused fish and cucumber, with a baby-
bottle of Diavolino’s Hock —and that’s six-
pence extra- —make you feel so strong and
self-satisfied that you accept everybody with
the trustfulness of a child. I might have
known had I been myself that nothing but
foolishness could result from the folly of
lowering myself to know that British rotter,
Charles Dubbin. He walked like a bear —
shambling along flat-footed. He had a sort
of double upper lip—it was so thick that he
had part of it folded against his teeth.
And his eyelids fell over at the outer
edges to cover up the corners of a
sneak’s eyes. Oh! a dirty, illiterate sneak
he was, and that soused fish blinded ‘my
judgment.
“He was ambitious, you must know, in
his little way. He wanted to be a council-
lor, and he wanted to be a mayor—and he
was a cow. He wore out the stairs of the
daily papers chasing paragraphs, and he had
the cheek to run for Parliament, but the
electors threw him right down into the cel-
lar. Then he told me lie badly wanted to
lift himself out of the fish-oil line and meet
financial gentlemen, and the long and the
short of it was that at last I got him made
a director of one of my mining companies.
Not the best kind, you know, but the sort of
company that’s always driving west looking
for the reef and can’t drive far enough be-
cause it hasn’t got the tram fare. ■
“Well, you understand, it was hard get-
ting him made a director, because the board
was very happy as it was, and the other
directors said Dubbin was a bounder and no
class. They were quite mistaken in that,
you understand, because his class was seven-
teenth, and he was born to travel steerage
with a Chinaman, and two Afghans in the
next bunk.
“He worried me to death about the direc-
torship, you understand, and I told him it
was above his station in life, but he per-
sisted, you understand, and at last one of
the directors died of misadventure with a
salad. The oil was bad, and I won’t swear
that Dubbin didn’t poison him to get the
job. Anyway, he knew about the death be-
fore anybody else did, and he was round to
me flat-footed, and I was worried into pro-
posing him as a director. I had less oppo-
sition than I expected, but that was because
we had 20,000 shares forfeited about that
time, and nobody was hankering for the new
job. He said he’d pay me for his qualifica-
tion shares later on —but as soon as I’d got
him appointed he told me to take half of his
director’s fees until he’d paid for the shares
that earned him a guinea a meeting.
“The first meeting he came to he was
quiet enough, but three of the other direc-
tors resigned because he was no class, and
the reef couldn’t be found without a search
warrant. We appointed three new men, and
the bounder got round them and was elected
chairman.
“Well! Well! It was shocking. I had
made him, so far as his connection with
finance was concerned. I was his god-
father ; and after that when I fed him with
half a guinea a meeting—he bit my hand.
The first day the sneak took the chair he
said to me —to ME, you understand
“ ‘Mr. Seketerry,’ he said, ‘the way these
here books is kep’ is posertuvly shockun’ —
posertuvly shockun’!’
“I nearly suffocated with surprise and
rage.
“ ‘My books?’ I said.
“ ‘Your books,’ he said. ‘Undoubterbly.’
“ ‘Undoubterbly?’
“ ‘Undoubterbly.’
“ ‘You mean undoubtedly,’ I said.
“ ‘’Scuse me!’ he said; ‘I said undoubt-
ubly.’
“I choked a bit, but kept my temper down,
and I said: ‘lf you think you could keep
these books better, Mr. Chairman, you’d bet-
ter be secretary, too.’
“ ‘P’raps I had,’ he said. ‘And let me tell
you,’ he said, ‘that the wages paid the seke-
terry is too high—undoubterbly.’ .
“ ‘Oh!’ .1 said, looking at him as if I’d
like to see him fall down dead. ‘Oli! In-
deed.’
“ ‘Then,’ he said, ‘l’ll ask my brothers of
the directory.’
“‘I don’t know your brothers,’ I said.
‘What directory are they in—Melbourne or
Country?’
“ ‘This directory,’ he said, looking around
at the other four directors as if they were
his samples. ‘I would like my brothers of
the directory to reduce the auditor’s fees,
too. Four ginnys a year for auditor is too
much, undoubterbly.’
“ ‘You’d better cut the mine manager out,
too,’ I said.
“‘I think so,’ the bounder says; ‘un-
doubterbly. We’re a long way off diver-
den’s.’
“ ‘And cut the miners out, too —and the <
dynamite and steel. Grease the rock with
fish-oil, and then set fire to it and burn a
hole instead of boring it.’
“ ‘lt would be more ’conomical,’ says the
bounder. ‘And while we’re about it let the
seketerry send in his resination.’
“I looked at him and wondered if he’d
suddenly gone mad. Here was I, his intro-
ducer to polite society, and the ungrateful
scoundrel actually proposed to destroy his
creator —that was me, you understand. I
had brought him from the outer darkness of
condemned fish-oil to the inner circle of
finance—even if the company was in a gal-
loping consumption. And now he wanted
to wipe out the cause of his success.”
“Scorning the base degrees by which he
did ascend,” I said; “or something of that
sort.”
“ ‘I beg your pardon.’ Diddle replied with
much dignity. ‘I am no base degrees—that
is, if you’re really alluding to me’....Well,
I got so dashed wild I resigned knowing the
company was on the rocks, and he got an-
other chap in, and they made a frightful
hash of it all, and at last Dubbin resigned
and sold all his shares —the qualification
shares he had at last paid me for —at tup-
ence a time. I’m glad he lost his few pounds
because he’s a squealer and loves money;
but a hideous curse on the blighter—his
vanity hurt my dignity and made me resign,
and I lost the company.”
“What does it matter?” I asked Liddle.
“What does it matter if it’s down and out?”
“But it isn’t,” almost screamed Willie
Liddle. “The new secretary was a Wowser,
and when that blighter Dubbin got out of it
the Wowser wanted to keep his secretary-
ship of it—it was worth 30 bob a week to
him, and a Wowser can lead a fast life on
30 bob. He got his galvanised iron taber-
nacle to take up the forfeited shares, and I
sold mine, too, for three halfpence each, and
they bought ’em. Curse them, too! They only
had four wages men below, but all the direc-
tors were Wowsers, and they prayed three
shifts.”
“What was the good of prayer, Willie?”
“Scoff as you like —these things are be-
yond me. They’ve prayed al5 pennyweight
reef into that mine, and it’s two feet wide
now and widening as they pray... .And I’ve
lost the chance —all through Dubbin, you
understand —the illiterate, sneaking, un-
grateful, English blighter whose vanity de-
stroyed the man who gave him a chance of
being something. There’ll only be one
happy day to me, and that will be when I
-read he’s dead in the outhouse he starred m
and without the drum of oil, not for enmity’s
sake; —not that —but for the shocking in-
gratitude, you understand, to the mau who
elevated him into the circle of finance.”
