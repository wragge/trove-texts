EQUAL TREATMENT
WHILE Wally and Beryl were still
centre stage at Glenfield, a minor ver-
sion of the same sort of melodrama
was in performance in the heart of
Western Australia — back on the ranch,
so to speak. At Laverton, about 150
miles north-east of Kalgoorlie, a young
Aborigine armed with a spear and a
boomerang was throwing stones at a
policeman trying to arrest him on
charges of assault. The constable tele-
phoned for help from Kalgoorlie, but
by the time two officers arrived the
Aborigine had given himself up —
without even asking for another
boomerang to keep the level of his
armory on a par with that of the
police.
A Laverton Police Court magistrate
later convicted the Aborigine, Roy
Linton, 18, and sent him to jail for
12 months. Linton did not ask for a
chance to redeem himself with the
Army in Vietnam.
FABLES FOR OUR TIME
A PARENT of our acquaintance would
have described his daughter to the age
of seven as perfectly conventional in
her view of life. However, he feels
that he recently saw the moment at
which, in today’s terms, she switched
from the Puritan ethic to the fun
ethic.
He was reading to her from “Aesop’s
Fables” and at the end of “The Hare
and the Tortoise,” he asked: “Now
what do you think that means?” “It
means,” she said, “that you don’t have
to win every race. You can stop and
rest sometimes.”
GROTESQUE HEATHEN IDOLS
THE OPENING of the Melanesian
Gallery at the Australian Museum last
week meant the end of two years’ work
for David Moore, Curator of Anthro-
pology, and David Rose, exhibition
designer. Both men worked long and
hard to produce a permanent exhibition
that would make the best use of the
wealth of the museum’s Melanesian art,
some of which has been stored for nearly
a hundred years.
“We were rather embarrassed with
riches,” Moore said. “We wanted to
GETTING ACROSS
“COME ALIVE WITH BOOKS” was
the slogan chosen for Children’s Book
Week this year. At a time when the
meaning of being an Australian has
come alive, and in a place — Sydney’s
Dixson Gallery — where the walls bear
framed pictures of early Australia and
Australians, it seemed that none of the
six authors present had given this
matter a passing thought. Until Denys
Burrows recalled that when he was a
child most of the books had been set
in England, there was little about Aus-
tralia, nothing about history there.
Behind him, a red-sashed Colonial
Governor glowered; before him, some
200 women, a handful of men, and
two small boys listened intently. They
had braved rain and the troubles of a
petrol strike to be there because they
were earnest parents, or librarians, with
McLuhan-age questions in mind; but
the six authors had only five minutes
each, and were not giving the right
answers. Their subject, “Why I write
for children,” was obviously the wrong
one.
Book of the Year winner Ivan
Southall said he was partly reliving his
own childhood, “the most exciting time
of one’s life,” but wrote books which
either or both adults and children could
read. Others on the panel spoke of
the scarcity of children’s books after
World War 11, most had children of
their own, one (George Finkel) had
begun with a book meant for adults
which was published as a juvenile, and
one wrote verse for her children and
Children’s book author Ivan Southall
with two young admirers
grandchildren. (“Isn’t this lovely, isn’t
this exciting. That’s all you have to say
to children.”)
Burrows sidled around the wrongness
of the subject and gave at least some
of the right answers. A radio inter-
viewer from way back, as well as a
freelance writer in several fields, he
has the fare gift of curiosity. (“I like
to share the things I discover.”) And
one of his discoveries was that techni-
cally minded youngsters claimed
“Stories annoy us”; and, as a corollary,
that there were children of high IQ
who were so anti-reading that they
could not distinguish signs on buses but
had to guess whether they were catch-
ing the right one. (“And, of course,
this shows up terribly at tertiary
level.”)
During a hesitant discussion, a gen-
eral “No” followed the verse lady’s
suggestion that backward readers
should merely be given books below
their age group. (“They reject that as
kidstuff,” said a librarian.) And
another librarian, touching, on the
current preference for non-fiction over
imaginative writing, declared that this
was no expression of the children’s
tastes, that, in fact, it was the result
of pressures from their parents.
Burrows threw in the disquieting in-
formation that, preparing material for
a series of “Careers” films, he had
tested on teenagers a massive, dull,
N.S.W. Government handout on the
subject and most had found it unread-
able, over their heads. That led to the
print-and-pictures discussion which
probably would have been the right
subject for the occasion — but by then
it was time for the Dixson Gallery to
close.
Before it did, one of the two chil-
dren present asked his question. Would
there be a sequel to Southall’s “To the
Wild Sky”? Southall reminded him that
the book had ended with one of its
stranded children saying, “I hope they
(adults) don’t come back too soon.”
The boy looked at him blankly. “That’s
where you take over and imagine the
children’s adventures for a while with-
out Mums and Dads,” Southall told
him. And Children’s Book Week regis-
tered another communications failure.

combine the aesthetic with specimens
offering impact, so we went through the
stored material choosing just what we
felt looked right. Then we checked the
old leather-bound books to find what
we had. And all the way through we
had chosen the oldest pieces. It is quite
evident that the work done before the
arrival of the white man is outstand-
ingly better than the later pieces.”
Perhaps more by good luck and
generosity than by dint of conscious
effort the Australian Museum contains
an extraordinary treasure trove of
Melanesian art. “We could keep chang-
ing the exhibition,” Moore said. “But,
of course, the work is very delicate and
Mask from the Huon Gulf in the Aus-
tralian Museum collection of Melanesian
art
each time it is moved we have accidents.
It is better to set up a permanent dis-
play for. some years and then arrange
an entirely new exhibition.”
David Rose had so much to work
with that he found no need to set up
explanatory dioramas. He used simple
shelves on metal stands, plain stretched
hessian, wooden stands enclosed in glass
and grouped his exhibits in the natural
regions which produced them with noth-
ing more than a small shaded map and
a brief description to pinpoint the place
of origin. In wood, plain or painted, in
chalk, ebony and bone the household
gods, totems, pots, shields and drums
blend in a perfect balance that many a
commercial exhibitor would give a great
deal to be able to achieve.
In 1964 the museum sent an exhibit-
tion under the then Assistant Curator
of Anthropology, Mr. D. Miles, to the
Sepik area and purchased some 2000
items. But long before that devoted
amateurs, traders, and adventurers were
bringing booty to the museum. In 1895
the intrepid Mrs. Forsayth brought back
an enormous slit drum which looks to
have been carved from a huge log, at
least 6ft. long by 3ft. round, which at
that time had been languishing on a
beach in the Admiralty Islands for ten
years. The malaggan carvings now
glowing in soft earth colors, their
intricate designs bathed in spotlights,
were rescued by Captain and Mrs.
Farrell from New Ireland in the 1880s.
They were literally rescued from de-
struction because after they had been
used in initiation ceremonies such pieces
were discarded. The Farrells also con-
tributed most of the chalk figures from
southern New Ireland.
At that time the art treasures of the
islands were not regarded as particularly
inspiring. They were noted in the cata-
logues of the day as “grotesque heathen
idols.” In the 1930s more interest was
taken, and a great many specimens
were purchased on behalf of the Aus-
tralian Museum by the late E. J.
Wauchope, who conducted a series of
Sepik expeditions. If he had not died
before he could complete his entire
project, he would no doubt have made
sure that the Australian Museum col-
lection was the finest in the world.
To coincide with the opening of the
gallery, the museum has issued a hand-
book on Melanesian art, written by
David Moore and illustrated with maps
and with photographs by Charles
Turner. They are already beginning to
wonder if the 5000 copies printed will
be enough. As Melanesian art is in-
cluded in the Wyndham scheme art
course at the fifth-year level, they may
well have a best seller on their hands.
Moore hopes that artists will find
inspiration in the new gallery. “I can’t
help but feel that anyone designing
fabrics, or working in bronze, or making
pots should come and see this. Look at
those little Massim pigs from the
Trobriand Islands. Why can’t someone
make a child’s piggy bank as charming
as that? There is so much to learn and
even to copy here.” He looked round
the silent gallery. “I find them rather
comforting — there is a nice sense of
security being dominated by household
gods and parent figures.” *
ADELAIDE OUT OF TUNE
ADELAIDE is on a slow cultural sim-
mer again following the announcement
last week by the Acting Premier, Mr.
DeGaris, that his government is pre-
pared to support the building of a Fes-
tival Hall on Montefiore Hill, looking
over the city and lying under one of
Adelaide airport’s main flight corridors,
at a cost of $4,250,000. He proposed
that the Government and the Adelaide
City Council provide the bulk of the
money, leaving some $550,000 to be
raised by public subscription. He hoped
that would be completed by
late 1971 and be used during the 1972
Festival. It is thus full circle.
After five years of desultory discus-
sion and hand-wringing by Govern-
ments, the Festival Board, and the
Council, the original and patently
unsatisfactory scheme has been re-
introduced. Over the years, perhaps the
only really intelligent move was made
by the Dunstan Government when it
commissioned a detailed Festival Hall
feasibility report from the leading
American organisation in the field, the
Bolt, Beranek, and Newman Theatre
Consulting Services. This firm sent Mr.
Thomas DeGaetani, one of the pioneer
managers of the New York Lincoln
Center, to Adelaide earlier this year.
He left a voluminous report on the
State’s future cultural needs, the neces-
sary capital works, and organisational
structure needed to run them.
The present war of civic words is
thus being fought by those who favor
an expensive showpiece, Boeing-727-
proof concert hall on a hill in a residen-
tial area out of the city proper and on
the other by those who support DeGae-
tani’s plan for an economically viable
performing arts centre to be built on
five acres of unused land at the back
of Government House, two minutes
walking distance from North Terrace.
The centre would contain a multi-
purpose theatre and concert hall seating
up to 2000, an axial theatre suitable for
a wide range of presentations, and an
experimental studio seating some 300
people.
However, what South Australian
Liberal Governments propose, the
Adelaide City Council can surprisingly
dispose. After considerable wrangling in
camera the council decided to recon-
sider the Government’s plan, which it
had initially accepted. It is clearly
divided on the issue with the old guard,
who initially proposed Montefiore Hill
five years ago, fighting on as colleagues
prepare to dispense with the plan even
though some $400,000 has been spent
on land acquisition and preliminary
work.
The real pressure in the matter has
come from the Dunstan Opposition,
which when in Government made the
development of a Performing Arts
Centre on the Government House site
a matter of election policy. Somewhat
surprised at the time, the now Premier,
Mr. R. S; Hall, remarked that he sup-
posed the State had time for cultural
matters now that the days of pioneering
a rugged country were over.
In disregarding the professional de-
tailed plan of DeGaetani, his Govern-
ment is, however, opting for the kind of
dilettantism that blights the Adelaide
cultural scene. As last week wore on,
the city’s usually dull civic round be-
came progressively enlivened as parti-
sans of each side made statements to
the Press. A progenitor of the hill
scheme, Alderman Irwin, described the
Government House scheme as a “red
herring.” The President of the Uni-
versity Theatre Guild retorted that
Government House land was more a
“sacred cow.” Someone even suggested
that the hall should be built over the
railway yards. The director of the 1970
Festival, Sir Robert Helpmann, chimed
in saying that, “It is no good the thing
being designed by a committee or the
Festival Board. They wouldn’t know a
theatre if they fell over one.”

CALLING ON
TWEENAGERS
TO PROTEST
ANOTHER MONTH has gone by and
almost all the news has been grabbed
by the young. Parliament was con-
sumed by the National Service Bill.
Twenty-three-year-old Wally Mellish
had all the front pages and all the air
space for eight days. Several schoolboys
were sent home for wearing their hair
too long and for sporting sideboards.
There were even appeals to the
United Nations. And there were pro-
test marches all over the place, all
for the young, including an attempt to
burn the U.S. Consulate in Melbourne.
It is impossible to suppress one’s
ugly feelings of jealousy. We 40-year-
olds why, not even the 30-year-
olds—never make the news any more.
Police never give us Armalite rifles,
there are no protest marches or con-
sulate burnings for us, and I ask you,
who ever orders us home from work
because of our long sideburns? Nobody.
We are the forgotten generation, un-
named, despised, and terribly misunder-
stood. Our fathers are still politically
active, the pensioners. They have Mr.
Wentworth on their side. They march
on Canberra and even gain sympathetic
titles, like Senior Citizens and Ever-
greens, but not the quarto-generarians;
they are nothing.
This is generally recognised in enter-
tainment centres. Several weeks back I
called at a Melburnian discotheque.
The young man at the door said: ‘What
do you want, grandpa?” “I beg your
pardon.” “Look here, grandpa,” he
continued, “this place is for cats under
25.”
Do you see the problems? We cats
over 25 now belong to an under-
privileged group. We have no pressure
groups of our own, no dance halls
which exclude the under 40s, no heroes.
We do not worry the police with a
quarto-generarian problem.
You will have noticed all this at
home. The sum total of human know-
ledge is now possessed by those aged
between 16 and 25. My father used to
settle all arguments with the line:
“When you are as old as I am you
will understand the stupidity of your
argument.” My university student son
settles arguments with the line: “If
you were as young as I am you would
understand the stupidity of your argu-
ment.”
And we’re losing ground every year.
One time a good footballer would last
until he was 40. Now they are elderly
at 25. I understand that our Olympic
swimmers for Mexico are mostly
around 14. The Seekers have just
retired far too old, really, in their
early twenties. Indeed, most singers,
except for a few geriatric marvels like
the Beatles, disappear at 21.
Mr. Bernard Dowd, of Dowd Associ-
ates, on a recent visit to the United
States, reported that there were now
such things as teen boards. Every large
department store needed a teen board
to decide whether this year they would
go big on earrings for the boys, or, say,
see-through loincloths for the girls. Oh,
yes, he said that young Americans
between 13 and 22 were spending $25
billion a year, of which half was going
on records, cosmetics, and car equip-
ment. The boys were .spending $l2O
million on hair creams, mouth washes,
and deodorants, and the girls were
spending $450 million on cosmetics.
Twenty percent of all high school
seniors owned their own cars.
Actually, this news is not right up
to the minute. There is another new
potent force in the U.S., the sub-teen,
the 11- and 12-year-old, and apparently
we were on the verge of a sub-teen
problem. Oh, the problem is just the
same here. Some of the most important
buyers at Myer’s are under 25, models
are aged at 22, and nigh on 25 percent
of hire-purchase agreements for new
cars are taken out by those 21 and
under.
Frankly, the quarto-generarians need
a massive promotion campaign to win
back their old superiority. A good name
is necessary and I have worried over
this for months. All sorts of names come
to mind, but they do not have quite
the right impact vintage-agers, mel-
low-agers, autumn-agers, adult-agers.
No, not good enough. The only hope
is tweenager, which suggests that one
is past blooming youth while pressing
toward the true brilliance of middle
age.
We need the right clothes. I would
suggest old brogue shoes, Oxford-grey
flannels, tweed sports coats, and cloth
caps, very Harold Macmillan and
double-breasted R. G. Menzies suits,
but with the bagginess of John Gor-
ton. We would need to move quickly
because Carnaby Street undoubtedly
already has such styles on the draw-
ing boards. We would cause a sen-
sation at the Melbourne Cup Fashions
in the Field this year by getting a
tweenager model out from England.
She would wear the complete cover-
up look with a skirt that dragged
along the turf. Mini-skirted teenagers
at the Cup would be aghast at the
sight of this lady carrying a bag, wear-
ing a hat, and having a ground-length
skirt. London columnists will fly out
by plane to take part in the furore. It
will be a major triumph for 40-year-
olds.
Our swinging groups will play
madrigals on electric harpsichords and
electric clavichords. We shall meet in
coffee shops and discuss protest authors
like Jane Austen, Meredith, Thackeray,
and Thomas Hardy. And naturally we
shall have protest marches. What shall
we protest for? How about a whole
week without anyone mentioning
students, sex, or Vietnam?

It is, of course, the cost of living. It’s
hit everyone. A couple could live on
a tenner a week two years ago, not
counting cost of booze, but now
twenty’s nearer the mark and then
you’ve gotta make the family-size corn-
flakes last a week. Or go without.
Well, it’s a mystery. Back in Aus-
tralia when they all return from their
in-trip to the Old Dart they say they
don’t know what everyone means
there’s no money here; Annabel’s is
crammed night after night with the
same crowd, they practically live there.
And half of London’s swanning
around in Bentleys and things, and the
women and the men spending a for-
tune on clothes. London really swings,
they say, reaching for the fifth glass of
champagne, 12/6d a bottle in Sydney,
and spooning down caviar, 6/6d a
pot in Woolworths. This is the kind
of information Bobbie would rather
not hear. They know how to live in
London, dark Anyone who thinks
otherwise is mad.
Wait till they hear that Mark Birley,
the hip gentleman who owns Annabel’s,
is opening another club in Marbella,
Spain, where all the crowned heads go
for their hols. And where the British
£5O-a-year travel allowance lasts exactly
one scintillating weekend. Bobbie slaps
on some tomato sauce and says that
what’s hit the rich is the wealth tax
that came with the last budget. Every-
one’s taxed a percentage on their pos-
sessions, very Continental, and the tax
boys got them all for the last year,
so there was no way of diddling. What
everyone’s doing now, on the advice
of their stockbrokers, is not investing
their money. You never know when
the English pound’s gonna devalue these
days but buy antiques.
Top prices at Christie’s, the auction-
eers, are unbelievable. One of Bobbie’s
friends put a silver Queen Anne choco-
late box up for sale. Well, no one uses
them these day; it’s only something
else to clean. The reserve was £750.
He got £3BOO. Two Regency card
tables go at the Grosvenor House
antique fair for £22,000. Fantastic.
There are other changes, apart from
London trains being left grey
aluminium to cut the cost of painting
them red, which is definitely not Bob-
bie’s orbit; there’s dear old Harrod’s
with its kinky purple decor “way in”
shop with, for heaven’s sake, the
Duchess of Kent still doing her own
shopping, this time Mary Quant make-
up which she’ll take with her, thanks
awfully.
There is also serious fashion
journalism for men., Deadpan. In the
“Times.” Paper underpants, £1 for 24
pairs. Followed by the hint that ladies’
paper knickers make awfully good arm-
bands, just cut the elastic off, chaps.
Then use the remainder for anti-midge
bites by placing over the head. Cut a
hole for the mouth, the ears come
through the leg-holes. Writes Rodney,
or it might’ve been Victor. While
Harold in the “Sunday Times” advises
against sage-green for sailing, which
seemed madly with-it last year. Nothing
is more depressing to find now it makes
you seasick.
And “Queen” magazine has been sold
to Michael Lewis, the property man.
The Duchess of Kent...still doing
her own shopping
They do say he bought it to get his
daughter’s wedding in. And everybody’s
stopped lunching in the West End. My
dear, when the Mirabelle starts charg-
ing £ll for lunch for two they had to
move. All the limousines which is
terribly Bobbie and, therefore, common'
usage are parked in King’s Road
outside places like Don Luigi’s. The
Bedfords go there, Larry Harvey,
Patrick Lichfield, all the chic set. My
god, the Caprice and Tiberio are out.
Club dell’Aretusa, across the road, is
absolutely the place, filled with the
sort of 'Samantha Eggars and Terence
Stamps and people like that, one of
the few places where one can lunch
al fresco; and Alvaro’s, who’s so grand
he’s withdrawn from the telephone
directory and then vets bookings on
arrival. Well, they are ab-so-lute-ly in.
And there’s been a rush of upper-
crust ladies to open boutiques with fun
names, Buy and Large, Annacat, and
Kaleidoscope. People have to make a
crumb somehow. Lady Ulick Browne,
who’s got Spectrum, in Gloucester
Road, a definitely non-chic place two

THE TAME CAT
AMONG
THE WILD CATS
FINANCIAL WRITERS are flattering
people. When they report jubilantly
that Western Mining has touched a
new peak, or that CSR lifts div., they
take for granted that you, the reader,
will gain by these happy events. Con-
versely, when Universal Prods shows a
loss or Ananias Hldgs goes into
receivership they assume that you will
share in the general gloom. In financial
journalism there is a polite convention
that everybody has investments in the
stock market.
But actually this is not the case.
There are certain citizens who do not
own any shares, bonds, debentures, or
even “short-term paper.” I understand
their state of mind, because I am one
of them. I appreciate the compliment
paid me by financial writers, who
believe that I possess a large investment
portfolio and am in daily communica-
tion with my broker. But I find it a
little embarrassing. The truth is that I
look at the financial news with no
greater sense of personal involvement
than a eunuch reading the Kama Sutra.
This was not always so. Years ago,
during a brief lull in domestic exigen-
cies, I had £lOO to spare and decided
to become a Small Investor. The Small
Investor has a respected traditional role
in the financial system, which is to Get
his Fingers Burnt, and I played it to
the life. Acting on reliable information,
I put my money into shares in a com-
pany called Blue Spec Mining NL. I
forget what it was mining for, but the
stuff was said to be awfully valuable.
Every day I turned to the financial
pages and looked up the quotations for
Blue Spec, my little eyes bright with
greed. The quotations, unhappily, took
the opposite trend to what I had been
led to expect, and in a short time my
£lOO was reduced to £25. The scar
tissue on my fingers may 'be seen by
any market analysts who are interested.
Since then I have never bought any
more shares. As the economics books
say, investment requires saving. I have
been too extravagant to save, recklessly
spending my income on bread, meat,
shoes, beer, doctors, and other luxuries.
Normally, this does not cause me much
concern, but during the present
minerals boom I have had the wistful
feeling of being an outsider. It may be
what literary critics call alienation.
From time to time, when another
Esso-BHP well reports an oil show, I
pass groups of shareholders dancing in
the streets. I would like to be able to
join in the gaiety, but have no sincere
impulse to do so. I have tried to work
up sympathetic enthusiasm. I said to a
Mrs. S , who owns a parcel of
BHPs: “I’m so happy for you about
your natural gas!” But she considered
the remark impertinent.
Lately I went to a financial writer—
they are nice people as a rule, apart
from their curious delusion that every-
body has a share portfolio—and told
him frankly about my alienation prob-
lem. I said: “I know it’s contemptible,
but I don’t seem to have any warm,
generous feelings toward the share-
holders in iron-ore and nickel com-
panies. I can’t identify with them. At
times I even have twinges of envy.”
He said: “Try to look at it this way.
Their prosperity is good for the coun-
try as a whole. It will help Australia
out of her balance-of-payments dif-
ficulties.” But the advice was of no
use. I would celebrate as wildly as
the next man if I owned a piece of
Hamersley or WMC. But I can’t see
myself getting roaring drunk because
Australia is improving her balance-of-
payments position.
Can readers be induced to follow
with interest the fortunes of companies
in which they have no shares, and are
not likely to have any? I think
financial writers might just manage it
if they gave more showbusiness-type
publicity to prominent industrialists.
“Dynamic Trevor Speedbuck, manag-
ing director of Midas Asbestos, refused
to confirm rumors that he will wed
Trishia Kirve, his personal assistant.”
That sort of thing. They could also
issue barracking kits of the kind which
newspapers supply to football enthusi-
asts buttons inscribed “I Like Rio
Tinto,” etc.
Yet there is something to be said,
after all, for being alienated from
the market. It is painful at the present
heady period but what if a shake-
out, slide, or recession comes? Financial
writers may then ask how I am able
to keep so cool. I shall reply com-
placently: “I could see it coming. There
was a cioud on the horizon, no bigger
than a Blue Spec.”


KEEPING UP WITH JAPAN
Comment by ‘Observer'
THAT SOMETHING terrible is about
to come out of Japan is a fear held not
only by certain kinds of Leftists and
Rightists in Australia, but by the
Japanese themselves. Some of that sense
of strong but unknown foreboding that
creeps through so much Japanese
writing also penetrates into Japanese
political discussion. Last year, at the
time of the Lower House elections, the
Japanese seemed to fear that some pesti-
lence was breeding in the black mists
of their politics: as it turned out, the
elections produced not the collapse of
parliamentary democracy but a vote of
confidence in the Government. This
month, during the Upper House elec-
tions, there were expectations of a dis-
ruptive vote that would upset relations
with America and challenge the present
carefully contrived ambiguity in rela-
tions with China; instead there was a
vote for things as they are.
To point in this way to the difference
between Japanese nervousness and
Japanese stolidity is not to say that
things cannot change in Japan things
can change anywhere but there is
no law of history that says that if things
change in Japan they have to change
for the worse.
However, that change must come
seems likely enough. It is almost beyond
belief that the Japanese will continue
for the next decade as they now are.
The force that could most quickly
become the world’s third super power is
the Japanese nation, yet the Govern-
ment of this nation has contented itself,
in the strategic sense, with being a
client State of America; and has tried,
otherwise, to avoid positive foreign
policy.
Solid forces of inertia have kept
Japan’s posture so low the shocks
of total defeat for the earlier militarist
adventurism; the overwhelming impor-
tance of America as a. market for Japan;
the sheer economies of being able to
get on with industrial and trade expan-
sion without the running costs of play-
ing the part of a world power. But
even the fact that Japan is tied so
strongly to America is a cause for in-
stability. To be linked with America, as
Australians are now discovering, is to
be linked to change. And Japanese rela-
tions with China are not likely to
remain forever in their present state of
carefully contrived near-meaningless-
ness.
It might be a mistake, however, to
imagine that any future easing of
Japan’s relations with China will
necessarily mean all that much. As the
world’s third-largest economy and a
big trader, Japan is necessarily a global
power, as well as an Asian power. It
is part of the backbone of the enter-
prising “West.” As a customer, China
is less important to Japan than it is to
Australia. Japan’s “natural” economic
relation to China is the colonialist one:
it is an encounter between one of the
world’s greatest industrial nations with
one of the world’s poorest nations.
Above all, China is important to the
Japanese in that problem of external
identity that is not yet resolved. Asian
nation or global power? If this month’s
election is any kind of a test (it prob-
ably isn’t), the interim answer is global
power.
It is one of the factors that might
finally jerk Australia from the remain-
ing shackles of its provincialism that
Japan is now so important to us, along
with America and South-East Asia.
Japan and America here are the two
greatest agents in the world for techno-
cratic change, Japan perhaps even more
than America, and while other Euro-
pean countries are familiar enough with
the economic importance of America,
Australia is the first European country
in which Japan, the new technological
giant, is of decisive economic import-
ance. It may be part of our luck that
our chance association with these two
innovators could, despite our preference
for old ways, carry us screaming into
the future, although if tensions between
these two merrtors should later become
greater than they now are, we may find
ourselves kicking in two different direc-
tions at once.
The immediate challenge that the
importance of Japan makes to Australia
is not one of political power for the
moment we both swim along in much
the same streams of contemporary
history. It is whether we are prepared
to modernise ourselves with some of
the energy that the Japanese devote
to that purpose. Or shall we later have
the Japanese coming out here to ex-
plain to us how we should revolutionise
our education system and our
approaches to modern decision-
making so that we can have some
chance of keeping up with them?
It would seem obvious enough that
we should at least now be making
greater efforts to teach Japanese. The
position of Japanese-language teaching
described in The Bulletin’s cover story
this week (page 28) shows no sense of
urgency. It is unlikely, if things are
left to the existing lot, that any sense
of urgency will emerge. It is probably
only the Commonwealth Government
that can create a sense of relevance and
priority: it should do this by flashing its
money. Best of all, it could offer to sub-
sidise the import into Australia of 200
Japanese teachers of Japanese next
year, say and to pay their salaries
for the first five years, the States to take
over after that. If our hesitance in mod-
ernising ourselves puts us in the position
in which part of our future prosperity
will lie in carrying out Japanese in-
structions we should at least learn the
language.
THE DILEMMA OF MR. HARRADINE
Comment by Alan Reid
UNLESS Mr. R. B. Harradine can
summon the supernatural power to be
in two places at once on August 5, the
Left Wing of both the political and
industrial sides of the Labor move-
ment are going to be pleased with
themselves. Mr. Harradine is a Tas-
manian delegate to both the ALP
Federal Executive and the Australian
Council of Trade Unions Interstate
Executive. Both Executives meet on
August 5, one in Canberra, one in
Sydney. Mr. Harradine has to decide
which one to go to.
Judging by his rejection from the
ALP Executive meeting to Sydney
earlier this year, it matters whether
Mr. Harradine attends meetings. It was
the crisis caused by his rejection from
the ALP Executive meeting in Sydney
earlier this year that led to Opposition
Leader Whiitlam’s decision to resign the
Federal Parliamentary Labor leadership
and recontest the position—a decision
that revealed that the Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party was split almost
down the middle, with Whitlam sur-
viving by only 38 to 32 votes the chal-
lenge of his Left-wing opponent, Dr.
J. F. Cairns. Mr. Harradine has been
denied readmittance to the ALP Federal
Executive unless he apologises satisfac-
torily to it for his suggestions that
“friends of the Communists” would seek
his rejection because he had supported
Mr. Whitlam against the Victorian ALP
Executive, which he accused of being
under “substantial” Communist influ-
ence.
The ACTU Interstate Executive
divides eight-all between Right and
Left Wings. The position of the ACTU
senior vice-president, which confers
considerable industrial power upon its
holder, has been vacant since the death
of N.S.W. Trades and Labor Council
secretary Kenny. The position remains
unfilled because neither of the factions
has been able to break the eight-all
deadlock.
There is no certainty that Mr. Har-
radine will be readmitted to the ALP
Federal Executive, even if he elects to
attend that meeting instead of the
ACTU Interstate Executive meeting.
He has put in a letter of apology to
the ALP Federal Executive, withdraw-
ing any insinuation that there are

“friends of the Communists” among
the members of that executive, but he
has not withdrawn his charge that the
Left-wing Victorian ALP is under “sub-
stantial” Communist influence. The
Queensland ALP has passed a reso-
lution saying, in effect, that Mr. Har-
radine’s letter of apology is not good
enough. South Australia and Western
Australia are taking a similar viewpoint.
The Senate Labor Leader, Senator
Lionel Murphy, who, along with the
other three Federal Parliamentary
Leaders, is a member of the ALP
Federal Executive, is also likely to favor
Mr. Harradine being forced into an
apology to the Victorian ALP Execu-
tive; and the deputy Labor Senate
Leader, Senator Sam Cohen, who will
also have a vote, is a member of the
Victorian ALP.
If Mr. Harradine does not present
himself for admittance at the ALP
Federal Executive meeting it would
suit the Left Wing in two ways.
In the first place it would put Tas-
mania, which supports Mr. Harradine,
in an awkward spot. Tasmania is insist-
ing that it has the right to have seated
in the Federal ALP Executive a delegate
properly elected as Mr. Harradine was
by the Tasmanian branch. Tasmania
considers this a matter of principle. But
if Mr. Harradine does not turn up, the
argument becomes difficult to sustain.
The Left Wing would not object to a
substitute delegate from Tasmania, par-
ticularly if, as is likely, that delegate
was the man who stood unsuccessfully
for selection as a Tasmanian delegate,
Mr. Paddy Williams, who has Left-wing
support.
In the second place the Left Wing
wants as large a majority as it can
muster for the resolution sponsored by
Mr. Chamberlain’s Western Australia,
seeking examination of the proposition
that the entire legal basis for the
Gorton Government’s maintenance of
Australian forces in South Vietnam
should be challenged in the High Court.
With Mr. Harradine absent, and Mr.
Williams his substitute, Mr. Whitlam’s
supporters on the 17-man-strong ALP
Federal Executive would be so reduced
that, to avoid a further disclosure
of his weakness, Mr. Whitlam and
the others might decide to go along
with the inevitable, and give the W.A.
resolution the outward appearance of
being supported unanimously. This
would suit the Left Wing very well.
If Mr. Harradine. decides to go to
the Federal ALP Executive meeting and
to skip the ACTU Interstate Execu-
tive meeting, that will suit the Left
Wing, too. There is no provision for
substitute delegates at an ACTU Inter-
state Executive meeting. This means
that, for the duration of the meeting,
the Left Wing will have an 8-7 maj-
ority. There is talk that if Mr. Harra-
dine is absent the Left Wing will
revive the question of the vacancy for
senior vice-president, and may take the
opportunity to put in their own
nominee. Whichever way Mr. Harra-
dine makes up his mind, the Left Wing
benefits.

AUSTRALIA
Defence: Integration after all?
DEFENCE MINISTER Fairhall’s
announcement a fortnight ago of a “far-
reaching reorganisation” of Australian
defence administration may have been
highly premature. But it may prove
eventually to be correct.
The changes made so far do not
justify such a big phrase. But The
Bulletin understands that changes con-
templated are much more extensive
than those so far announced.
One reason for the present silence
Fairhall and Bland...other
integration measures?
is that agreement has not been reached
on the full extent of the reorganisation.
But senior men in the Defence Depart-
ment say that a really radical change
is being considered. This would be the
abolition of the Joint Planning Com-
mittee and the transfer of the Direc-
torates of Planning and Operations
within each of the separate Services to
the Defence Department.
In one hit, this change would achieve
the essence of integration. It would
take the spinal cords out of each of
the Services and graft them together
within the Defence Department, mak-
ing it at last the backbone of Defence
Planning and Operations.
The Air Force’s Directorate of Plans
and Policy, the Army’s Directorate of
Military Operations and Plans, and the
Navy’s Directorate of Plans would each
be taken out of their own Departments
and put in the Defence Department and
fitted within the six new sections which
have been created to replace the old
Joint Service Committees.
Such a move would integrate the
top operational command structure of
the Armed Forces. It would leave the
separate Service Departments as
administrative units for looking after
the pay, housing, clothing, and general
welfare of Services men. The Chiefs
of Staff would be bypassed on opera-
tional matters.
Mr. Fairhall’s Press statement of a
fortnight ago said that the immediate
reorganisation left intact the Joint
Planning Committee and the planning
staffs of the Services. It announced a
duplication of planning work, and
seemed to envisage that plans would be
shuffled back and forwards between
the Defence Department and the plan-
ning staffs in the Services. It was inti-
mated that it would take years for the
Defence planning staff to gradually take
over work from the staffs of the Ser-
vices. A lot of new positions would be
created in the Defence Department,
while the Services’ planning establish-
ments would be frozen. In other words
there was to be integration by attrition.
It is this tame and tentative approach
that is now being re-examined. Settling
firmly in a halfway house, it does not
go far enough to ensure that the con-
fusion and inefficiency of the old Joint
Committee system is done away with.
It threatens to open a whole wide area
for boundary disputes between the
Services and the Defence Department.
And by duplicating work it increases
the strain on already short-staffed areas
of defence administration.
To make some sense of the new
arrangements, the Government is likely
soon to announce a special bursary or
cadetship training system for recruiting
graduate staff to the Defence Depart-
ment, to try to fill the huge gap between
the staff establishment and actual
numbers. At the same time it will be
recruiting from the planning staffs of
the Services. Many people in Defence
see the advantage in a shortcut to
integration which eliminates the slow
stages of building up the Defence De-
partment’s planning outfit while main-
taining those of the Services.
Defence reorganisation was first
looked at in the beginning of 1967,
when a committee was established to
consider the abolition of committees.
But it is now mainly the work of the
new Secretary of the Defence Depart-
ment, Sir Henry Bland, who is playing
a major role in speeding and pushing
through the changes.
Other integration measures are in the
wind. Duntroon is to be expanded into
a tri-Service academic college, but for
the moment the Air Force with its
lavish Point Cook academy is resisting
the proposal. There is also a proposal
to establish a new joint staff college for
senior officers of all Services. The
National Capital Development Com-
mittee is in the process of abandoning
plans for residential development in the
Canberra airport. area. Large tracts
are being reserved for military use.
PRAWNS
RAW OR RED?
ON WEDNESDAY, Thursday, and
Friday mornings the voice at the Rus-
sian Embassy end was refusing to com-
ment for journalists trying to get the
Russian side of the prawn-fishing affair.
And then at last on Friday afternoon a
little notice appeared on the Press
gallery notice-board: “Press briefing,
Russian Embassy, 3.30 p.m. Subject:
Prawns.”
The Embassy attracted the largest
collection of journalists for a long time.
Everyone served with beer, potato chips,
and peanuts (“No prawns, I am sorry”),
Russian Press attache Ivan Stenin told
of great solidarity and friendship be-
tween Russian and Australian fishermen
operating together in the Gulf of Car-
pentaria. Almost every day they visited
the big Russian ship to use the showers,
watch films, and generally socialise. A
delegation of friendly Australian fisher-
men had visited the Russian ship, pre-
senting souvenirs to the fishermen as a
token of Russo-Australian friendship.
The Australians were just as surprised
Stenin...“solidarity and friendship”


as the Russians to hear radio reports
of ill-feeling.
There was, however, one selfish firm
which wanted to get rid of the Russian
ship, was envious of its mighty size,
and wanted perhaps to put a shadow
over Russian-Australian relations. An
Australian ship (not identified) had
come to within 100 yards, shouted abuse
N 0 RTH-WESTT STAR
The Russian trawler "scatters” Australian fishing boats
in Russian, and loosed off two shots
from a carbine. A delegation of Aus-
tralian fishermen had visited the ship,
dissociating themselves from this act
of hooliganism.
The Russian Embassy considered this
“piracy,” but was not pressing the
matter for the time being.
On the Mostyn company’s complaints
of intimidation, the Embassy said this
was “nonsense.” Operations were quite
normal, according to the captain of the
ship. The large Russian ship sometimes
found itself rather too close to the
smaller Australian ships in the com-
petition to get into position to trawl
effectively. And then, as a warning,
sirens were sounded as a matter of
routine.
Sometimes the Russian ship with its
radar equipment located prawns first
and when it moved to the new area
the Australian ships followed. At other
times, the Australian spotter plane
located a catch and the Russians fol-
lowed.
The Russian Embassy felt it was a
small matter which should not be
allowed to harm Australian-Russian
relations, and although they would not
condemn the sending of a gunboat, they
felt there were “cheaper and easier”
ways of investigating the affair.
Government officials felt the affair
was coming to a pretty successful con-
clusion on Friday afternoon. They said
it was standard Russian practice for
there to be a complete denial of res-
ponsibility. But the protest could have
served its purpose. By now Moscow
would have instructed the ship’s cap-
tain to behave himself in future.
HMAS Attack is on the way from
Darwin to see that he does.
In the meantime, there are moves
to redefine the status of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. It is extremely shallow.
No international shipping routes need
access to it.
The Department of External Affairs
and the Attorney-General’s Department
will be investigating the possibility of
declaring the Gulf internal Australian
waters. The Russians have accepted the
right of nations to go beyond the 12-
mile limit as fishing waters. Off Argen-
tine they accept that Government’s
claim to fishing sovereignty, and pay
licence fees for fishing rights.
The same situation may develop in
the Gulf. At least there are now people
in Canberra who think those prawns are
ours.

APOLOGY TO MR. LEE
IN MAY last year, under the heading
“Sun”-beams, The Bulletin published
an article in which it was said that Mr.
Alfred Lee, the News Editor of the
Hong Kong “Star,” would be remem-
bered for such flights-of-reporting-
fancy as the Tasmanian Monster affair
and the Skripov interview when he was
the only reporter in a plane load be-
tween Sydney and Darwin to get a
quote from the expelled Russian.
Mr. Lee has complained that our
comment has been taken as meaning
that the reports were fabrications. This
was not intended and The Bulletin
apologises to Mr. Lee for any injury
done to him thereby.
ABORIGINES
DISMAY DAY
LAST WEEK the nation looked to
Prime Minister Gorton for “a fine
opening gesture” to the Federal Gov-
ernment’s expected “co-ordinated and
generous effort to right the wrongs of
a long-neglected group in the Aus-
tralian community.” But if these
phrases, typical of the expectations
voiced in newspaper editorials through-
out Australia, were also typical of the
expectations of Australians generally,
Mr. Gorton failed to live up to them
when he announced the details of pro-
posed Federal aid in Melbourne last
Friday—National Aborigines Day.
Mr. Gorton used only the most
general terms to promise that the Com-
monwealth would give the States un-
defined amounts of money to help
their Aborigines in health, housing, and
education, and would help finance
schemes which the Aborigines might
propose for their own betterment. He
said much too little, and even failed
to produce one of those touches of
rhetoric which allow politicians to
evade issues they genuinely support
but have not been able to blueprint.
The State Ministers concerned with
Aboriginal affairs, who had come to
the conference either armed with or in
the wake of submissions to the Federal
Government on help their States needed
to improve the conditions of their
Aborigines, greeted - the Prime
Minister’s announcement that the
details would have to await the Budget
with considerable dismay.
Basically, Mr. Gorton was reaping
the willy-willy set in motion when the
Nexus referendum failed, but its accom-
panying section, which asked for Com-
monwealth right to make laws for the
betterment of Aborigines, was given a
resounding “Yes” by the Australian
people. In the intervening six months
or so public opinion has continued to
prod the Federal Government into
doing something positive with this right,
and the States have prepared plans
ranging from Western Australia’s pro-
posal for spending $3O million on
Aboriginal Welfare during the next
five years down to a submission from
Tasmania for the resettlement of Bass
Strait islanders, “not Aborigines in the
general sense of the word” but needing
help in employment and education.
Not only did the force of opinion
and the States’ detailed submissions
appear to catch the Government un-
awares, but also its timing seemed to
have failed it on this issue. Last week
the Commonwealth Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs, Mr. Wentworth,
overwhelmed in Cabinet on the Gur-
indji tribe’s land issue, was left to at-
tempt to defend the indefensible —as
far as the public and most of the news-
papers were concerned. Mr. Went-
worth’s well-publicised months of effort,
discussion, and promise on behalf of
the Aborigines had come to amount to
no more than a volume of words.
After that, only a positive, really


Aboriginal Harry Penrith addresses marchers in Melbourne last Friday.
THE AGE
“fine opening gesture” could have saved
Mr. Gorton and his Government from
general embarrassment over the Abori-
ginal question. Headings over editorials
last Friday varied from the Melbourne
“Age’s” cry of “Shameful farce” to the
Brisbane “Courier-Mail’s” “900 Acres
for the Gurindji tribe,” with its implied
exclamation mark.
“A residential area, a paddock, and
some orchard: this is the Federal Gov-
ernment’s mean, unfeeling answer to
the Gurindji’s plea for a little of their
tribal land,” the “Sydney Morning
Herald” began its comment. The Mel-
bourne afternoon “Herald” said, “The
Gurindjis can have welfare schemes
and aid of the white man’s choosing.
Their desire to work out their own
future on their own land was appar-
ently too inconvenient for Canberra.”
Off in the wings, Aborigines in
Darwin were talking of leaving the
missions and settlements, rejecting edu-
cation and assimilation, and returning
to the bush to live by hunting. “Edu-
cation is important to us, but what is
the use of it to our children if they
are never to have land of their own?”
In Adelaide Opposition Leader Dun-
stan told a students’ meeting that Abori-
gines should own their reserves, that
pastoralists should return some of their
lands to be administered by a lands
trust such as South Australia had set
up for its Aborigines. But “the door
is not closed ... a beginning has been
made, and where it might lead will
depend on productive exploration and
effort rather than on destructive
attack,” said Woolgrowers and Graziers’
Council president T. B. C. Walker.
An in Melbourne, as the State
Ministers agreed on a statement
that Mr. Gorton’s “offers had
been welcome,” several hundred
peaceful demonstrators, organised by
Abschol and comprising interstate
students and a very few Aborigines,
stood in the rain chanting “Land
rights” in front of Victoria’s Parliament
House. Said a hard-bitten reporter,
“It’s a pity some of their wetness can’t
fall where it’s needed, on the stony
ground inside.” Some of them had
come from as far as Brisbane, but no
one from the conference would agree
to talk to them. There was little mood
for comment after Mr. Gorton had set
the pace.
WILFRED BURCHETT
UNLIKELY "JOE BLOW"
ASK OLDTIMERS in the Saigon
Press corps how to get a visa to visit
North Vietnam and they will reply:
“Ask Wilfred.” They’ll be speaking of
Mr. Wilfred Burchett, the veteran Aus-
tralian publicist who has spent many
years in Asian Communist countries.
In Phnom Penh Mr. Burchett has
often been titled unofficial North
Vietnamese ambassador to Cambodia.
And almost as often as he has man-
aged to get Westerners’ visas to Hanoi
he has tried to enlist support for the
grant of an Australian passport. For
instance, he asked Australian journa-
lists to use their influence with Prime
Minister Harold Holt when he visited
Cambodia last year.
Last month he put in a formal appli-
cation for a passport. He was in
London on a short visit from Paris,
where he accompanied the North Viet-
namese delegation. He says he wants
the passport so he can return to see
his aging father in Victoria.
When he first announced that he was
applying for the passport, the Prime
Minister’s Office prepared a statement
for inquiring pressmen which said: “In
view of Mr. Burchett’s long history of
assistance given during the Korean
War to the enemies of Australia and
the U.N., and during the present time
as a publicist for the Hanoi regime,
any such application will need to be
looked at very carefully.”
There has been no decision yet,
partly because the item is low on the
Cabinet agenda. And partly because
there is confusion about the legal posi-
tion.
Since Mr. Burchett has not adopted
new nationality he retains the citizen-
ship of his birth. He is still an Aus-
tralian. Strictly, he does not need a
passport to return to Australia. When
asked last week by The Bulletin, the
Immigration Department said that an
Australian citizen was expected to pro-
duce a valid passport to establish his
identity and citizenship. But it was not
essential. Identity and citizenship could
be established by a birth certificate and
other documents.
But, with or without a passport, Mr.
Burchett can be kept out of Australia
if the Government so decides. The fact
of Australian citizenship confers no par-
ticular constitutionally protected rights,
because the Constitution contains no
Bill of Rights like that of the U.S.
Papuans, for instance, are formally
Australian citizens, but administratively
they are treated as foreigners. Their
entry to Australia is strictly controlled.
The Minister for Immigration has full
powers to control the entry into Aus-
tralia of any person, whether an Aus-
tralian citizen or not, and whether in
possession of a passport or not. That
appears to be the legal position, but
Ministers have not been very clear
about it.
The real decision is a political one.
The granting of a passport is a sort of
reference from the Government. “Over
Dick Casey’s name we are saying: this
is Joe Blow, one of our mob. He’s a
good bloke, do what you can for him,”
was the way an Immigration Depart-
ment official described the meaning of
a passport.
The Government could hardly grant
Mr. Burchett a passport and then
launch a prosecution against him, as
some Ministers would like to do. The
British Government, in a White Paper,
has named him as having been “actively
engaged in brainwashing procedures”
against Allied prisoners of war in North
Korea, and the Australian Army has
affidavits from POWs who had been
questioned by him. He seems unlikely
to be welcomed by Mr. Gorton’s
Government.
POLLUTION
LOOKING INTO SMOG
A PALL of blue-grey pipe and cigarette
smoke hung over the basement room
of Parliament House set aside for last
week’s meeting of the Senate Select
Committee inquiring into air pollution
in Australia. But the Senators were
concerned with the hazard and nuisance
of wide-scale contamination from indus-
trial plants and motor vehicles and not,
as one Senator termed it, “volumary
internal pollution.”
The committee was set up last April
on a motion by then Senator Sir Den-
ham Henty, a former Government
Leader in the Senate. But for his Com-
monwealth driver’s pride, Sir Denham
may never even have considered the
problem. One day in Sydney Sir Den-
ham’s driver pointed out a “thick layer
of grime” that had built up on the car
while parked outside an office block for
40 minutes. Sir Denham became a
convert to clean air.
Last week the Committee, set up to
inquire into causes and effects of pollu-
tion, into prevention and control
methods, and, in traditional Parlia-
mentary language, “matter incidental
thereto,” got down to work. Ten wit-
nesses were interrogated, including
officers of the State Health Depart-
ments.
The Commonwealth has no power
over air pollution matters. Constitu-


tionally it is purely a matter for the
States. The Senators, headed by West
Australian Liberal George Branson,
were trying to find out how the Com-
monwealth could help. Yet some of the
States seemed remarkably reluctant to
put forward proposals for Common-
wealth help. They just wanted the
establishment of an expert committee
to hold regular meetings to “discuss”
the problem.
N.S.W.’s Chief Air Pollution Engin-
eer, Mr. P. Murphy, who provided the
best documented case and indicated his
State was leading the nation in com-
bating air pollution, came up with one
of the few suggestions for Common-
wealth action. Taxation concessions for
companies installing anti-pollution de-
vices would go a long way to help
overcome the problem, he said. At
present, companies were installing
equipment for the public good, often
with no direct return to themselves.
None of the witnesses was able to
give any sort of indication of the cost
Sydney smog ... “view” of
the Harbor Bridge
of pollution in Australia, though the
Committee would be enormously
strengthened in its recommendations if
it could point out the magnitude of the
problem in dollars and cents. It was
not until the last witness for the week,
Dr. Werner Strauss, a lecturer in chemi-
cal engineering at the University of
Melbourne, suggested a Common-
wealth-backed research program that
figures began cropping up, and even
these were comparisons with the
United States.
Pollution costs $3O per head per year
in America today. If this figure can
be transferred to Australia, pollution
could be costing $360 million a year.
Yet, according to Professor Strauss,
Australia is probably spending no more
than $lOO,OOO yearly on research.
In the next few months the Com-
mittee will wander around Australia.
It has already collected a formidable
swag of witnesses to be called. Senator
Branson has gleaned the names of
alleged air polluters from last week’s
witnesses, Offenders can expect closer
scrutiny from the Committee than they
get from some of the Health officers
charged with handling the problem.
OPERA HOUSE
ANTI-CLIMAXES
DESPITE the books and millions of
words of Press reporting it has spawned,
the Sydney Opera House is still a
largely incomprehensible tangle of
politics and artistic controversy. One
way to understand it better is to see
it for yourself, but even that has its
problems. The public is only admitted
to the site for conducted tours on Sun-
days, and the tours are now booked out
until September, 1969.
“There are more than 600 groups
and organisations on the waiting list,”
says Opera House public-relations man
Vic Friedlander. “We manage to accom-
modate 12 tours every Sunday, with
about 80 people in each tour. We’ve
found that 80 is the maximum number
for comfort and that if we try to run
more than 12 tours in the day they
begin getting in each other’s way.”
The first tour moves off from the
gates at 9 a.m. and the last at 2.30 p.m.
It’s no junket, nor a picnic for the
limp or lame. Ahead of each tour group
is two hours of walking, standing, and
stair-climbing around the four-and-a-
half-acre site. There are six guides (two
of them from the Stage Three archi-
tects, Hall, Todd, and Littlemore; the
others from the Public Works Depart-
ment), and. each guide talks to his
group through a loudhailer. For every-
one the tours are thirsty work. Unfor-
tunately, the Opera House has not yet
let any lemonade concessions.
It has been said that the building is
now, probably, at a stage of construc-
tion more pleasing to the eye than it
will be when completed. In its still
somewhat skeletal state it is possible to
see it as a lovely ruin, something to be
fondly reminisced over more than to
be put to disputive use.
But the first of the trimmings are
already in place and the natural mag-
nificence of its rugged beauty is being
covered. Seen up close the pattern of
glazed and matt off-white ceramic tiles
covering the shells is not altogether
pleasing; one tourist already has likened
the tiles to a lavatory. The trial mock-
up of the glass in-filling on the eastern
side of the building shows how difficult
it will be to match the aesthetic line of
the soaring concrete.
A common impression, after the first
hour of following the guide, is how
comparatively little space seems to be
devoted for functional use in such an
enormous building. The size of the
main hall comes almost as an anti-
climax after tramping through the
cavernous areas in the bowels and centre
of the building. In the smaller opera
theatre it is difficult to imagine 1500
Sightseers on a tour of
Sydney’s Opera House
or 1600 people being seated even with
the balcony which is now, somehow,
to be added; and the incomplete 600-
seat drama theatre requires immense
vision before it can be seen as much
more than an expedient afterthought.
Too much still has to be done,
though, to judge functional adequacies
more than speculatively. Yet it is fair
to say that the restaurant, which will be
housed under the small shells on the
western side of the concourse, alreadv
seems woefully undersized. Its planned
seating capacity, on two levels, is only
280. When playing to capacity the
Opera House will have about 5500
patrons under its shells.
Those who can’t book or wait for
the guided tours have the alternative of
inspecting the building from the view-
ing platform, with its scale models and
recorded commentaries, overlooking the
site. Mr. Friedlander says that in three
years more than 500,000 people have
checked on progress in this way.
And of the guided tourists who arrive
at the site critical of the project he
says: “Most of them go away con-
verted.”
NORTHERN TERRITORY
FINDING THE VOTERS
NOW THAT Aborigines are entitled
(but not compelled) to vote, the elec-
toral office in Darwin is seeking to
enrol more before the Northern Ter-
ritory’s next Legislative Council elec-
tion in November. Proposed new
electoral boundaries would give elected
members 11 seats and a majority over
appointed Members in the Territory’s
emerging Government for the first
time. Although this part of Australia
contains an estimated 21,000 Aborigines
and 37,000 whites, no Aborigine holds
a seat on the Legislative Council. Pre-

sumably one could be elected in Novem-
ber if the boundaries for predominantly
Aboriginal Arnhem Land are approved
and enough voters of his race enrolled.
An electoral officer who has been try-
ing to interest the Arnhemlanders in
the vote, Mr. W. McPherson, has just
returned to Darwin a little dispirited.
Mr. McPherson said he felt that the
Electoral Office was working on the
right lines, following the methods of
communication researched by univer-
sity men, Aboriginal consultants, and
the Welfare Department in 1962. He,
and another electoral officer working in
the south of the Territory, were using
still photos, drawings, and specimen
voting cards to illustrate the process
and purpose of electing. Film strips
were also being prepared and mock
elections held.
The campaign aimed at telling the
Aborigines enough about the impor-
tance of voting, while stressing that it
was not compulsory, to induce some
of them to register voluntarily. The
electoral officers did not expect to have
much influence with the older people,
but thought the younger ones would
respond (even though undercutting the
elders’ authority was a form of
detribalisation).
Mr. McPherson admitted that he
took no Aborigines with him but con-
sulted local Aboriginal councils at each
mission or settlement he visited. He
always found someone who could under-
stand him and who said he would pass
the message to other Aborigines. He
said he was sure the Aborigines under-
stood what he was talking about as
they always assured him they did. But
not many were interested. Asked
whether he’d tried saying directly to
Aborigines that, by registering and
voting, they could improve their own
conditions and get such material things
as a motor-car, Mr. McPherson said in
that event on Aborigine might expect to
vote and have a car delivered to him
next day.
The use of tribal or totemic forms
of art adapted to electoral education
had not been considered, nor had the
use of comic strips. Use of symbols
for parties and candidates, as prac-
tised in India, had been discussed but
dropped on the recommendation of
Welfare. “They are in touch with the
Aborigines and they should know best.”
Meanwhile, there are other interest-
ing aspects. The Liberal Party will con-
test the November elections, introduc-
ing Party lines. No one knows whether
Aborigines have been approached to
stand for Arnhem. One, Phillip Roberts,
has announced that he could not give
up a $3OOO Government job for a
Council seat at $lBOO plus $4OO allow-
ance. Arnhem, with its proposed boun-
daries accepted, would eventually in-
clude a new mining town at Gove. The
plans of all political parties could be
upset if too many of the non-enrolled
Aborigines were to take up their fran-
chise.

OVERSEAS
A switch to political
battle against the Viet Cong
A SIGNIFICANT section of South
Vietnamese political opinion is now
swinging round to the idea that the
war must be ended by a negotiated
settlement leading to some form of
political competition with the Viet
Cong.
There is also a quite new feeling of
optimism about the chance of beating
the Viet Cong in this sort of peaceful
competition, although these ideas are
seldom, if ever, discussed unambigu-
ously in public. There is a natural
reluctance to show evidence of flexi-
bility while Hanoi and the National
Liberation Front stand unbudging
behind their present maximum
demands.
One young politician with a possibly
important role to play in the future said
that people see a military solution to
the war as no longer possible. Tied up
with this is the feeling that anyhow
the war has gone on for about as long
as is bearable. Perhaps most important,
it is useless to continue with the old
victory-through-war policy now that
America has revised its attitude to
Vietnam.
The Vietnamese, who are ready to
talk along these lines, seem to agree that
political competition will mean one
day meeting the Viet Cong in some
form of electoral combat. Ideally this
would be held under the terms of the
existing constitution.
The scheduled municipal and pro-
vincial council elections, for which no
date has yet been set, could provide a
local testing ground. No one, however,
seriously considers the possibility of a
coalition government made up of
members of the present Saigon Admini-
stration and the National Liberation
Front.
The diplomatic steps that would have
to be gone through to reach this stage
are not the main concern of these poli-
ticians. They are more worried about
what they consider the complete unpre-
paredness of the country to face up
politically to the Viet Cong.
Again and again one hears the same
complaint. “We have concentrated on
the war to the exclusion of politics.”
A young politician now trying to put
together an organisation that has roots
among both peasants and workers said:
“Until very recently anyone who even
talked about peasants and workers ran
the risk of being thought pro-
Communist.”
These men are not very clear about
how they are going to revive the interest
in politics of the suspicious and long-
suffering man in the street and the
paddyfield.
But there is general agreement that
what is needed more than anything else
is some form of political organisation
that goes way beyond the old cliques
of nationalist intellectuals that have
often existed as political Parties only in
the imagination of their founders.
Hopes are now centred on a new
political grouping called the Alliance
for Social Revolution, with which most
of the politicians, now thinking in terms
of a political settlement, are in some
way connected. At the moment the
Alliance is still a piece of political
Heath Robinsonry that could fall apart
overnight.
But it has three things in its favor.
President Thieu, who has hitherto been
extremely nervous of identifying with
any one political group, has given the
Alliance his guarded blessing and con-
ceivably could one day more or less
assume its leadership.
Most observers in Saigon accept that
this is probably necessary if the country
is to face up to the Viet Cong at the
polls.
Second, at least one of the Alliance’s
main component groups, the Liberal
Democratic Force (led by one
of Thieu’s political advisers), has in its
four months’ existence already managed
to attract supporters in some provinces.
Finally, the country’s largest trade
union organisation, the Vietnamese
Workers’ Confederation, is taking part
in the Alliance indirectly through one
of its side organisations. Its leaders
could possibly provide the positive
thinking on social and economic pro-
grams without which no Party is going
to have real popular appeal.
One long-time foreign observer of
Vietnamese politics remarked this week
that “for the first time it does look
as though the nationalists are better
placed than they will admit themselves.
“If they can only hang together they
may very well find that the Viet Cong
are by no means ten feet tall when it
comes to a political battle where they
don’t have an ace in their hand.”
JAPAN
HOW MUCH THE SAME?
LAST WEEK’S victory for Prime
Minister Sato and his Liberal Demo-
cratic Party in the Japanese Upper
House elections came not because he
gained seats 'but because his Party did
not lose as much as did the Japanese
Socialist Party.
The size of LDP losses was seen in
advance as a crucial indicator. The loss
of five or six seats would have meant a
defeat for Mr. Sato and his almost
certain failure to get re-elected late
this year as Party President and there-
fore to obtain a third term of two
years as Prime Minister. In the event
the LDP lost only two seats (winning
69), while the JSP lost eight out of
their previous 36. As predicted by most,
the smaller Parties made gains at the
expense of the two larger ones. Komeito
increased its seats from nine to 13,
showing impressive urban support in
Tokyo and Osaka. The Democratic
Socialists increased their seats from
President Thier with General Abrams, U.S. Commander-in-Chief in Vietnam


three to seven, while the Communists
increased theirs from one to four.
What do these figures indicate for
the future?
First, that the drift toward what the
Japanese refer to as multi-party democ-
racy, while noticeable, is not as strong
as some Japanese observers anticipated.
Neither the Komeito nor the Demo-
cratic Socialists nor the Communists
are considered to have a chance in the
foreseeable future of becoming one of
the two major Parties, though, given
domestic insecurity and revived quasi-
religious nationalism, Komeito might
make it. Equally, neither the LDP nor
the JSP is likely under present cir-
cumstances to enhance its popularity
and position. Consequently, short of the
JSP undergoing the kind of transforma-
tion Mr. Whitlam dreams about for
Prime Minister Sato...he held the
line last week
the Victorian ALP, the most likely de-
velopment in Japanese politics in the
long run is that the LDP might one day
have to think in terms of making a
coalition with either Komeito or
the Democratic Socialists, or both.
Komeito and the Democratic Social-
ists both stand for the moderate
moderation of Japan’s present stance
toward the United States and China.
Events may push the Japanese toward
such moderation and, in any case, there
are factions within the LDP pushing in
the same direction, some in even more
extreme directions.
But, as things stand, Mr. Sato has
held the LDP line and these other
factions may not get their chance. In
the ceaseless ebb and flow of the
factional infighting of Japanese intra-
party politics, predictions are unreliable,
but as of now Mr. Sato can point to
the state of the poll if not the state
of the street demonstrators, to justify
his stance as still having substantial
backing.
But perhaps it would be more correct
to see the election in terms of a nega-
tive. Had the LDP losses been greater,
Mr. Sato’s chances of continuing to be
Prime Minister through 1970 (when the
alliance with America can be re-
negotiated) would have been very dim.
But this is not to say he is certain of
Party Presidential re-election come
December. ;
Once again external events could
well determine the Japanese future.
The American Presidential election
might still have some surprises in store;
the victory of a candidate pledged to
re-interpret America’s Asian policies
would remove a healthy chunk of Mr.
Sato’s raison d’etre. The possibility may
be remote, but it was not for nothing
that during the election campaign Mr.
Sato hinted that the Party election
could be brought forward to November,
though he has since changed his mind.
After all, getting Japanese acceptance
of the American bases is one thing, but
getting the Americans to accept that
continuance might—if not in 1970, then
later—be an even more edgy proposi-
tion.
Personal factors may work against
Mr. Sato as much as external ones. If
he gets his third term then there will be
those for whom the doors of Party
advance might be for ever closed. His
re-election is still far from certain.
Even if, as seems likely, he con-
tinues in the driver’s seat, then there
will still be those who will see his posi-
tion as roughly analagous to that of Mr.
Kishi, who fell during the 1959-60 anti-
American storms. It is not likely 1969-
70 will be so placid.
Beneath the outwardly stable and
relatively unchanging surface of Jap-
anese election results and political pro-
cesses there are many potentially vola-
tile forces. Komeito’s advance is but
one indication of this. Mr. Sato is a
shrewd and skilful politician capable,
as this election has shown, of saying on
defence matters, for example, what
many Japanese—not to mention out-
siders—would rather not hear. But, like
President Johnson, he does not have
that relevant personal magic which is
an essential adjunct to statesmanship.
What should be a debate over Japan’s
position and direction and internal
reform may very likely instead become
a struggle focused on Mr. Sato’s per-
sonality.
AMERICA/JOHNSON
BIG DADDY TO THE LAST
PRESIDENT JOHNSON may not be
the first person to enjoy his job more
after he has given notice, but his re-
newed enthusiasm and energy are con-
spicuous. He threw both into the self-
appointed task of spurring on the
Central American Common Market.
Flying to San Salvador, he met with
the Presidents of Guatemala, Honduras,
El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.
While he could do nothing to hide
the fact that a House of Representa-
tives’ committee has just cut 20 percent
from the new budget for the Alliance
for Progress in Latin America, the
President could at least announce that
he had approved about $65 million
in new loans for Central America; be-
yond that, he sincerely wished the
regional trading arrangement good luck
and provided it with some helpful
publicity. Then, with the kind of big
daddy gesture that he enjoys, Mr. John-
son gave four of the Presidents a lift
in his plane, dropping them off at their
respective capitals, on his way home.
Earlier, guiding about 30 Latin
American diplomats around the Hemis-
Fair in San Antonio, Mr. Johnson
showed that he still has a unique ability
to cross the line from corniness into im-
pressive simplicity when he chooses.
The setting was right out of a Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical it was the
Fourth of July, Mr. Johnson wore a
brown silk suit and ate two ice-cream
cones. Yet his speech was far from
trite. There is no independence, he said,
for the man who is poor, sick, or un-
trained, nor for the wealthier one who
breathes polluted air, drives in a per-
petual traffic jam, and is afraid to go
out at night.
In the current issue of “Look,” Mr.
Drew Pearson, the columnist, has writ-
ten that Mr. Johnson’s fear of not living
until 1972 (more because his health
might fail than because he feared
assassination) was the motive behind
his decision not to run for the Presi-
dency again. Whatever his reasons
were, Mr. Johnson seems eager to make
the most of his last seven months as
President and to use his powers to
further what he most believes in. Some
people criticised Mr. Johnson for
appointing a new Chief Justice to the
Supreme Court when he was in the
twilight stage of his own administration.
But as the retiring Chief Justice, Mr.
Earl Warren, said, the President has a
right to perform the duties of office as
long as he holds it.

AMERICA/THE PRESIDENCY
CLEAN-HANDS CANDIDATE
Senator McGovern...“third man”?
A LAST-MINUTE effort has begun
among some former prominent
supporters of Robert Kennedy to
launch a third Presidential candidate
into the race for the Democratic nom-
ination.
Vice-President Hubert Humphrey has
been ill with flu this week and Senator
Joseph McCarthy has been in retreat
in a monastery.
The “third man” is Senator George
McGovern the “favorite son” candi-
date of his own State of South Dakota
and, ironically, the original choice of
the peace movement when it was
searching for a candidate last Sep-
tember.
At that time Senator McGovern, a
46-year-old war hero who served
briefly in the Kennedy administration
as head of the Food for Peace program,
and a Senator since 1962, rejected the
overtures made to him. This permitted
Senator McCarthy’s emergence as the
anti-war standard-bearer.
With only six weeks to go until the
Democratic convention, Senator
McGovern today suffers from just the
same handicaps that originally afflicted
the McCarthy candidature. As a
national politician he is virtually un-
known, he has no power base outside
his own State, and he has never before
been thought of even fancifully as a
prospective occupant of the White
House.
In the eyes of the former followers
of Senator Kennedy he does, however,
possess two overwhelming assets. He
holds acceptable views on the war and
has never been involved at any stage in
opposing Senator Kennedy’s own bid
for the Presidency. Senator McGovern
is seen, as it were, as a man with clean
hands.
How far what is now being planned
is a serious bid to launch George
McGovern as a Presidential prospect
and how far it is merely intended as a
conscience salve for Kennedy delegates
at the convention remains obscure.
What seems certain is that when
Senator McGovern’s name is put up in
Chicago it will attract at least first-
ballot support of well above the 26
votes that South Dakota will be cast-
ing for him automatically.
AMERICA/NEGROES
BLACK APARTHEID
A DEEP SPLIT has occurred in the
“New Left” Negro organisations over
the issue of “reform or revolution” in
American life. In recent weeks bitter
disunity was disclosed in the ranks of
the National Association for Advance-
ment of Colored People and the Con-
gress of Racial Equality at their
national conventions. Dissident leaders
walked out of both conventions taking
large numbers of delegates with them.
The issue at stake was whether mili-’
tant Negroes should support the idea
of one United States for both Negroes
and white, or two separate States, one
black and one white.
In the CORE convention, for ex-
ample, a resolution was introduced pro-
posing the establishment of a separate
black nation to take in the States of
Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, West
Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama,
Georgia, and Florida. As an alternate
proposal, the resolution suggested that
Negroes consider as a national home-
land “those areas of land contained
within south-west Africa and the Union
of South Africa.” No suggestion for
removing whites from the new “black
nation” was forthcoming. The new
nation would have complete political
independence from the rest of the
United States.
However, Whitney Young, head of
the National Urban League, another
Negro organisation, opposed the idea
of “black apartheid” or a return to
Africa for American Negroes. He called
for a “united United States,” in which
the black people of the ghetto con-
trolled their own destinies and achieved
greater equality through political and
economic power.
The dreams of the separatists in
Negro ranks were nothing but fantasies,
the “New York Times” commented in
a leader. The great majority of •Ameri-
can Negroes neither wished to migrate
to Africa nor to be herded into a
separate black reservation that could
not be a strong, prosperous modern
State. Separatism could become a major
but damaging political current among
Negroes if large numbers gave up hope
of achieving full and equal American
citizenship.
“It would be naive to suppose that
complete integration can be soon
accomplished,” the “Times” admitted.
“But even while progress is made
toward that goal, it is essential that
Negroes and whites work together to
meet the concrete immediate need of
most American blacks—better educa-
tion, better housing, more and better
jobs, and a more influential voice in
deciding their own and the nation’s
future.”
NIGERIA
TOO MUCH GUILT
IT IS MISLEADING to pin too much
hope on the Nigerian Federal Govern-
ment’s offer to open an overland “mercy
route” to Biafra. Even if Colonel
Ojukwu, the Biafran Leader, were to
reverse 'his earlier position and accept
the offer, such a route could not ensure
the massive aid needed to combat
famine. Airlifts directly into Biafra will
do even less.
Both are necessary and useful for
urgent relief purposes: yet neither is
likely to be enough to avoid disaster,
more especially if as seems highly
likely the Federal hawks win the day
and launch their threatened invasion of
the Ibo heartland, where 8,000,000
people are crowded.
So the dangers are enormous and
imminent with the Biafrans encircled
and facing starvation, and the Federals
angrily impatient that world opinion
prevents them from taking full advan-
tage of their military victories.
It is unlikely that informed public
opinion will be willing to tolerate
British support of the Federal Govern-
ment especially over the sale of
weapons unless there is effective
action to avert the possibility of hun-
dreds of thousands of Biafrans dying in
the next few months. Not only are
Prime Minister Wilson and his col-
leagues aware of this sense of public
unease: they fully share it.
But the brutal truth is that attempts
to end the killing and get relief supplies
into Biafra have got bogged down in
the politics of civil war. This means
that; nothing less than a cease-fire can
create the conditions in which massive
effective aid can be provided both to
save the dying and to avert the spread
of the mass-killer, kwashiorkor, the
protein-deficiency disease which, once
it reaches a certain stage, is almost
irreversible. Even the youngsters who
survive are often mentally crippled for
life.
The plight of Biafra’s refugees has
Two starving Biafran orphans who
have only each other to cling to


become a powerful weapon in the hands
of Colonel Ojukwu.
Colonel Ojukwu wants relief for his
people. But even more he wants to get
the Hind of support that will enable
him to rally his defeated armies and to
restore his depleted resources. Only in
this way does he believe he can ensure
the final survival of his Ibo people.
With this kind of reasoning, his policy
makes sense and it is in this sense
the Federals suspect uncontrolled relief
supplies.
The Federals, on the other hand,
see the famine being used as a powerful
propaganda weapon against themselves.
They deeply resent the image of them-
selves as cruel men bent on decimating
the Ibos. And they react strongly
against those who wish to deny them
the fruits of their victory a reunited
country. They insist that they have one
of two choices: either to crush Colonel
Ojukwu militarily or to starve out the
resisters. They now know world opinion
will not stand by while the Biafrans
starve.
Their offer of “mercy routes” over-
land is a genuine contribution toward
helping the international relief organi-
sation, but they have no intention that
it should become a massive food opera-
tion. Colonel Ojukwu has in the past
rejected this offer because he sees it as
a way of further establishing the
Federal authority.
The Federals’ refusal to allow un-
supervised air flights into Biafra is also
defensible on military if not on humani-
tarian grounds. For if they were to
accept an established air route for
relief they would automatically impose
on themselves the restraint of not
destroying Biafra’s landing strips. They
suspect (not without reason) the relief
will come in by day and military
supplies by night.
Above all, however, a cease-fire is
Indispensable, because even if some kind
of short-term solution is found to the
problem of relief it is bound to fall far
short of the real needs required to stave
off large-scale famine.
So far, progress toward a cease-fire
has been delayed mainly because the
Federal Government insists that the
Biafrans must agree, in principle, to
negotiate a Nigerian union. It is not
impossible, however, to find a formula
to meet this difficulty provided both
sides find themselves under equal pres-
sure.
So far, all the diplomatic pressure has
been on Lagos. But time is running
out. Any day now the invasion of the
Ibo heartland may be under way.
It is no longer enough to rely on
initiatives from the Commonwealth, the
British, or the Organisation of African
Unity. There is only one hope. It is
for the Security Council to take a hand.
If its members were to support a reso-
lution guaranteeing conditions for
relief, warning against further military
action, pressing for a cease-fire and dis-
patching U Thant to Nigeria and
Biafra, it is just possible that both
sides may be persuaded to change their
positions.
It is unlikely that the Russians or
anybody else on the Security Council
would resist a resolution provided it has
the backing of important elements in
the Afro-Asian group at the United
Nations. The cost of failure might be
counted in millions of unnecessary
deaths. This would provide a guilt
the world would not find .easy to live
with.
FRANCE
OFF WITH HIS HEAD
PARIS last week witnessed with con-
sternation a political beheading worthy
of the Ottoman court: the abrupt dis-
missal of Georges Pompidou, the one
man in France, apart from the General,
to wear the magic mantle known as
political authority.
A week ago his future as de Gaulle’s
Ex-Prime Minister Pompidou (right)
and his successor, Couve de Murville
accredited dauphin seemed as certain
as anything can be in politics. He was
the architect of the greatest electoral
landslide in French Republican history
—a triumph crowning six years as
Prime Minister.
Today he is planning a holiday in
St. Tropez with his political future in
the gravest doubt. De Gaulle, who
made him, has now broken him. It is
an amazing demonstration of political
virility in a man of 77.
The President consulted no one be-
cause no one apart from himself in the
Fifth Republic had any political
reality—neither the loyal barons of the
regime nor the newly elected 300-
strong Gaullist Parliamentary Party.
“Participation”—the General’s slogan
at the moment —w'as clearly not going
to begin with them.
The replacement of Georges Pom-
pidou, the politician, by Maurice Couve
de Murville, the technocrat, marks a
fundamental change in the French poli-
tical landscape. In crude terms, it
means that General de Gaulle is no-
where as near retirement as so many
have thought.
The General emerges as the grand
victor of the May revolution—lonely,
dependent on no one, and, in strictly
party political terms, stronger than
ever.
But the problems of France remain
—this was de Gaulle’s own phrase last
week at his first meeting with the new
Cabinet. These problems fall broadly
into two categories: those which call
for great technical skill, such as the
difficulties now facing the French
economy, and those which require
imagination and political horse sense,
such as winning back the confidence of
an alienated younger generation and
satisfying the great thirst for dialogue
in the country at large.
Couve de Murville may be the right
man for the first talks but seems hardly
equipped for the second. It may be
.that in his anxiety to eliminate a rival
General de Gaulle has lost the services
of the one man who could have seen
through the profound reforms now
urgently needed: to draft a new deal
which will ease relations between Paris
and the regions and between bosses and
workers, and, above all, within the 15
w'eeks before the beginning of the uni-
versity term, to outline a policy which
will draw the fuse from a still explosive
student situation. Can Couve de
Murville do it?
Everything in his background points
to a highly disciplined, mildly conser-
vative mind—the mind not of a states-
man but of a great servant of the State.
Pompidou is by no means the only
casualty of the May crisis. The Socia-
list Leader, Francois Mitterrand, is fight-
ing for his political life against vigorous
attempts to unseat him from the Presi-
dency of the Federation of the Left.
He is under attack from two directions:
from radicals, such as M. Felix Gaillard
inside the Federation, who never liked
Mitterrand’s tactical alliance with the
Communists and blame their electoral
defeat on it, and from the old-itmers
on Guy Mollet’s politburo.
But these squabbles on the Left seem
trivial compared to the drama being
played out at the summit. The great
subject for gossip—and that is all any-
one has to go on —is why the General
sacked Pompidou so brutally at the
height of his powers.
The inescapable conclusion is that
Pompidou was cut down because he
represented to the Elysee a rival centre
of political will. The Prime Minister’s
office at the Hotel Matignon had be-
come a very considerable source of
influence and patronage. Pompidou
had placed his men in many key posi-
tions. His ideas were beginning to influ-
ence policy. The affluence in the ante-
chambers of the Matignon made Elysee
seem remote and a little neglected.
The former Prime Minister’s presi-
dential ambitions may have seemed a
shade too concrete for de Gaulle’s
stomach.

What do we know about Asia?
NOT SO LONG AGO it was a pretty
poor sort of household which did not
have a bit of Benares brassware some-
where and a line of ebony elephants on
the picture-rail in the living-room.
These would be bought by someone
when the ship called at Bombay on
the way home. There was bamboo
furniture in the sunroom because it was
cheap, not because it might be fashion-
able. If someone went on a cruise the
whole family then trooped to the bath-
room in artificial silk kimonos with
straw slip-ons on their feet. All this
represented the Far East.
A few wealthy people acquired col-
lections of jade or other carvings and
Chinese or Japanese art or furniture.
These people might never have visited
Asia. Their interest was generally
second-hand, following at some distance
fluctuating fashion in Europe for
chinoiserie and inspired by their visits
to European galleries and public places
where they saw the results of the taste-
ful looting of previous centuries. In
much the same way other collectors
acquired a knowledge of Mandarin
Chinese or undertook Oriental Studies
at universities. This was the Orient.
Today there is a Toyota or a Mazda
in the garage, a Sony transistor to
someone’s earhole, a young commen-
tator on TV sending his report from
Vietnam or Singapore, possibly even a
Thai or Malaysian student boarding in
the spare room. This is Asia.
This view of Asia is certainly a more
reasonable one. However, knowledge
and understanding are not ensured by
driving Japanese cars or listening to
Hong Kong transistors. The task of
learning about the countries of Asia
and, for both practical and general
reasons, learning their languages is a
massive one. How is it being under-
taken? How much do we know about
Asia? How best can we learn about
Asia?
We can begin at the top and have
our Prime Ministers visit the area
regularly. We can have Asian experts
threaded through Government depart-
ments. But if we want to do the job
properly we must begin at the begin-
ning: in the schools. We have to turn
our social studies and history courses
upside down, we have to teach Asian
languages so that students going on to
universities have the minimum equip-
ment to carry on with Asian studies,
and so that our businessmen are not
hopelessly disadvantaged. Although at
a few levels Australia seems to be turn-
ing its face to Asia, at many things
remain depressingly the same.
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: The
“Asianisation” of Australia was a pro-
cess that began in Canberra with the
External Affairs Department when it
was being run by Dr. Evatt in the late
19405. Evatt interested in South-
East Asia not so much for itself, or its
proximity to Australia, but because it
represented colonial exploitation and
underprivilege. But this special con-
cern took quick root in the Department
and the various Liberals who have suc-
ceeded him as External Affairs Minis-
ters have all shown a special obsession
with South Asia. It seems to go with
the job. Before Australia had a single
diplomatic mission in Africa or Latin
America and only a few in Europe it
was represented in most countries in
the Asian region.
It is mostly from this early External
Affairs Department interest that every-
thing else grew. (Members of the De-
partment were privately lobbying the
universities as far back as the late 1940 s
to set up special schools of Asian
studies.) In the knowing-about-Asia
business the External Affairs Depart-
ment —as one might expect —'has got
more tucked away in its brains than
any other organisation in Australia.
After the External Affairs Depart-
ment, the Department of the Army be-
came the most “Asianised” department.
A small group of majors around
Colonel Ted Serong managed to con-
vince their Chief of Staff that it was
wrong to persist with training which
presupposed warfare in either the North
African desert or on the plains of
western Europe. Over a period of three
years the Army switched entirely to
tropical jungle warfare as its opera-
tional medium. The slouch hat and
khaki were replaced by the bush hat
and deep jungle greens. Malaya be-
came the prototype battleground and
the World War II jungle training centre
at Canungra was reopened. The
armored regiments still teach desert
warfare—until recently it never
occurred to them that they could oper-
ate their Centurions in a place like
Vietnam. But the rest of the Army
is completely geared to tropical opera-
tions and many of the better officers
have good political and social know-
ledge about at least South-East Asia.
“Asianisation” of the other service
ministries has not been so complete.
But the present strengthening of the
planning section of the Defence De-
partment, along with the fact that it
is now carrying out its reappraisal of
Australian strategy, may complete the
detachment from the more global con-
siderations that were traditional in
Australian military thinking.
The Treasury is thoroughly non-
Asian in knowledge and orientation.
When they travel, Treasury officials
overfly Asia, going to Geneva, Paris,
Brussels, or London, or to the IMF
in New York or the World Bank in
Washington. Occasionally a junior
official will be sent to an ECAFE semi-
nar, but generally Asian countries are
not visited. The formation of the Asian
Development Bank and the fact that
Treasurer McMahon has been elected
president may alter this somewhat.
The Department of Trade has its
commissioners in all Asian countries
and does big business in Japan. (China
is left to the Wheat Board.) But most
of its activities are in the big moneyed
markets of the world: Western Europe
and North America.
The Immigration Department, need-
less to say, steers very clear of Asia,
although there is a small “non-
European migration section” which
deals with the very slowly growing
business in this field.
Perhaps the most significant factor
of all about Government officials is
that most of the iniportant ones stay at
home. Going back to the days when
Australia had severe balance of pay-
ments problems, the Australian public
service has been very strict in limiting
overseas travel. Even in the External
Affairs Department there are “desk
officers” looking after the affairs of
countries they have never visited.
Members of the defence and foreign
affairs branch of the Prime Minister’s
Department have not been out of Aus-
tralia more than a couple of times in
the past decade.
POLITICIANS: The word “Asia”
has long been a vogue word among
Federal politicians and an extraordinary
number of them seem to have shaken
the hand of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.
Parliamentary trips and, in a few
cases, privately financed expeditions
have been their main source of educa-
tion. With a few exceptions they don’t
do much reading, but even when they
do the unusually crude division on
foreign policy of Federal politics pro-
duces little show of knowledge. “Asia”
for most politicians (as for most Aus-
tralians) means South-East Asia, with
side glances at India and Japan.
The degree of interest in “Asia” in
State politics would be no more than
in the rest of the community, except
in Western Australia, where it means
Japan, along with a realisation that
Djakarta and Singapore are not far
away.
BUSINESSMEN: Although there. is
more and more talk about “trade with
Asia,” a glance at the statistical tables
shows that most of it is the supply of
raw materials to Japan and China, a
matter that involves very few business-
men. However, a few large Australian-
owned companies and more small ones
than you might expect sell things to a
few South-East Asian countries and, in
a few cases, have set up local manufac-
ture. Marketing men are those most
involved, often because the foreign-
owned company to which they belong
operates throughout the area and some-
times because a headquarters for part
of its Asian business is now in Australia.
More expertise is probably being built
up than appears on the surface, but it
is disorganised. There is little sharing
of knowledge, and, apart from the
Trade Department (which is patchy),
no central expertness to draw on. Each
business company has to make it up as
it goes along.
THE PRESS: More newspapers are
opening bureaus in Asia to break up the
London-New York axis. However, there
is no doubt that reader interest often
inclines to the familiar frivolities of
Britain, Paris fashion, or American TV
stars than to the seriousness of Asia.
Asian coverage still tends to be con-
fined to certain countries, notably and
inevitably Vietnam, along with Singa-
pore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Coverage
of Japan is remarkably weak.
TV AND RADIO: The Australian
Broadcasting Commission has per-
manent offices in most Asian capitals.
ABC radio has a regular Sunday pro-
gram, “The Week in Asia,” in addition
to items covered in general news broad-
casts. However, radio and television
generally depend on the availability of
material. Sometimes the ABC “Week-
end Magazine” will seem to be almost
totally absorbed in minor matters of
France simply because-France provides
a good deal of film. Asian countries,
Japan excepted, are not wealthy enough
to do this sort of job.
Apart from news, Asian affairs do not
take up much time on radio or tele-
vision. The ABC at times features
music from various Asian countries,
notably Japan and India, but in drama
“Samurai” with American dubbing
was a wild exception to the general
rule.
PUBLISHERS: Australian book pub-
lishers generally are alert to the possi-
bilities of Asian titles; these are so far
more likely to be books by Australians
or other Westerners on Asia than books
by Asians in translation. The publishers
are not stimulated merely by interest
in Asia here; many of them see their
best prospect of getting a world market
for their books is by specialisation, and
Asia is an obvious field.
One publisher estimated that in the
past 12 months about 20 books on Asia,
apart from textbooks, have been pub-
lished here. Books on Vietnam have
probably bumped up the total. There
are two novels on Vietnam, one by an

Australian, one by an Asian, due from
one publisher soon, and there is a steady
flow of books about the war generally.
A joint publication, such as “Con-
temporary Artist in Japan,” by David
Kung, at sls, which Angus and Robert-
son published jointly with a Japanese
firm recently, would have been unthink-
able ten years ago.
CULTURE EXCHANGE: The
achievement of Prime Minister Gor-
ton in concluding a cultural pact with
Indonesia during his Asian tour may be
exactly what we need; or it may not.
Official culture does not always work.
However, in exchange for a brief
orchestral tour and tours by the Aus-
tralian Ballet Company and Marionette
Theatre we have had visits from the
Bayanihan Filipino Dance Company,
the Chitsasena Ceylonese Ballet Com-
pany, and the Kalakshetra Dancers of
Madras, and a Japanese orchestra.
Music is probably the artistic field
in which contacts and understanding
grow most quickly. Young musicians
would often prefer a year in Japan
to a period in Europe. Composers,
such as Meale and Sculthorpe, know
and are influenced by the music of
Asia, notably Japan. Asian music is
being acknowledged in school sylla-
buses (Indonesian music is a choice
for one part of the music syllabus for
the N.S.W. Higher School Certificate
this year) as well as in universities. On
the other hand, enthusiasm for Ravi
Shankar and his sitar would
undoubtedly come to us second-hand,
probably through the Beatles.
The most important collection of
Asian art belongs to the National Gal-
lery of Victoria. It is reputedly of excel-
lent quality and contains good paint-
ings and a large selection of sculpture.
The other galleries have smaller col-
lections. Mr. Robert Haines,, of David
Jones’ Gallery, Sydney, has made not-
able collections of Thai and Khmer
pieces and of Christian religious figures
from the Philippines. However, all this
is of historical interest and access to
modern Asian work has not been exten-
sive.
The most obvious link with Asia
in art is through pottery. Australian
ceramicists go to Japan to work and
Japanese potters have come here. The
collection of ceramics used to be con-
fined mainly to older pieces and was
for the rich. Now people buy con-
temporary Japanese pieces. The Bony-
thon Galleries had an exhibition of
modern Japanese pottery recently.
SCHOOL ASIAN STUDIES: Many
small schoolchildren are undoubtedly
more familiar with what the syllabuses
tend to call “our neighbors to the near
north” than their parents are. Educa-
tion Departments are introducing
“modern Asia” as a subject, particularly
into social studies, history, and
geography.
In primary schools social studies in
a simple way establishes Australia’s
place in relation to Asia. It compares
Australia with the countries of Asia
and discusses our problems with those
of our neighbors.
Last year a new course in Asian
Social Studies was introduced in New
South Wales secondary schools as aji
elective subject for students in forms
two to four. It will be examined for
the first time this year at School Cer-
tificate level. It embraces the study
of Indonesia, Japan, India, China,
Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan, and
Ceylon. It has been planned as a suit-
able introduction to the study of Asian
languages in senior forms. It begins
with Java and Peking man and covers
philosophy, literature, art, music, and
the general culture of the people of
Asia.
The Asian Social Studies course may
be presented with history or geography
or social studies or with a combination
of history and geography. Asia comes
into the School Certificate forms’
history syllabus in the study of the
emergence of newly independent coun-
tries, the Colombo Plan and other such
organisations, and Australia’s relations
with Indonesia, Malaysia, and so on.
Much the same applies to geography
and the ordinary social studies syllabus.
However, it seems at present easier
to provide a broad but simple picture
in the lower forms than it is to give
more specialised courses for forms five
and six. This could be due in part
to the lack of teachers trained in these
fields and some gaps in the supply of
suitable textbooks. Many of the books
set for the N.S.W. School Certificate
Asian Studies course are American.
Australian publishers are exerting them-
selves in this direction, but the leader
of a British publishers’ delegation, h~re
to sell textbooks recently, admitted
he was “unaware” that Australian
schools and universities were already
teaching Asian subjects.
UNIVERSITY ASIAN STUDIES:
In the field of tertiary studies on Asia,
the Australian National University is
obviously in a class of its own with the
practical advantage that it is the only
university in Australia which tends to
gather students freely from the whole
country.
Half the university’s humanities re-
search is centred in the School of
Pacific Studies, which is part of the
Institute of Advanced Studies and
which covers Asia with particular
emphasis on Indonesia, China, and
Japan. It contains probably the world’s
leading centre for the study of Indon-
esian Economics under the energetic
Professor Heinz Arndt. Knowledge of
the language of the area of specialis-
ation is essential for anyone joining a
department of the school. The Ford
Foundation is heavily involved in the
financing of research at the school.
Another department of the ANU
which covers aspects of Asia is the
Department of Oriental Studies in the
School of General Studies. This depart-
ment offers courses in the languages
and literature of China, Japan, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, and also survey
courses in Asian culture and civilisation.
There are really two kinds of “Asian
studies” in universities those that
are courses in themselves, and those
that are part of other courses. So far
as specialist non-language Asian studies
undergraduate courses are concerned,
in the State universities Sydney and
Melbourne make almost all of the
running, with Melbourne ahead on
special Indonesian studies, Indian
studies, and also offering a course called
East Asia Studies 1. Several other
universities, although not running to
special departments, have co-ordinating
departments that put together courses
run by other departments.
It is probably the extent to which
Asian countries (where relevant) are
including in other courses, such as
economics, political science, sociology,
or history, that is the real test of
“Asianisation.” To take a negative
example: Sydney still offers a course
in Ancient History that, while including
Greece and Rome, does not include
China and India. Most universities are
now including study of Asian countries,
where relevant, in departments that
are not specialist Asian departments
or they are talking about doing so. In
this respect history departments are the
best served and economics departments
the worst. Melbourne seems to be the
front-runner; Hobart tails the field.
(Perhaps they are still preoccupied
with Mainland Studies.)
SCHOOL LANGUAGE STUDIES:
It is useless to pretend that to turn
large numbers of children from the
traditional acquisition of menu French,
grand opera Italian, or Danny Kaye
German to painfully getting a smatter-
ing of Asian languages is not a major
undertaking.
When you consider the teaching of
Asian languages in schools you are at
the last link in the chain: school studies
depend on teachers, and teachers on
what the universities and training col-
leges offer with the inevitable factor
that it takes time to train teachers.
(This begs the question of whether
languages should not be taught by
nationals; surely the most useful Asians
we could have here are language
teachers. The present position in some
States is that Asians who are not
naturalised can be employed only as
temporary teachers at a low salary rate
in State schools.)
One current estimate is that there
are about 50 teachers of Asian
languages in New South Wales out of
a total of about 32,000 teachers; prob-
ably no State does better than this
and some may be worse off.
It is not always that schools are
lagging while eager pupils wait for
teachers in Asian languages. Some
education authorities lament the in-
difference of parents who still de-
mand French and German. Some
schools have tried to establish classes
in Asian languages, but have had to
abandon them for want of support.
Melbourne Grammar taught Japanese
until 1939, but no longer does.
Apart from prejudices which chil-
dren pick up from their parents or


perhaps their teachers, there is the
practical problem that children will
look for easier and more familiar sub-
jects to make 'sure they will keep up
in the race toward matriculation. In
most States children have to make up
their minds at the age of about 13
on what subjects they will take.
Figures released this month show
that of the 18,015 students who sat for
the New South Wales Higher School
Certificate in 1967, 6709 did French;
1038 German; 71 Italian; 1558 Latin;
8 Spanish; 8 Greek; 30 Russian; 5
Hebrew; 21 Dutch, 181 Bahasa In-
donesia; 5 Japanese; 174 Chinese. A
large proportion of those doing Chin-
ese, and probably Italian and Dutch,
would be nationals.
In the schools the way in is obviously
Bahasa Indonesia, or Indonesian. This
is the main language of the more than
100 million people nearest to us; it
uses roman script and is more closely
related to Malay, the chief language of
Malaysia and a useful one in Singapore,
than Italian and Spanish are to each
other.
Indonesian has been available in New
South Wales State schools for about five
years, but it has already proved the
most popular Asian language. This year
there are about 20 schools teaching it,
about double the number in 1966. Total
number of students might be a couple
of hundred. In Victoria, Indonesian is
being taught in about 12 schools. There
it is beginning to be taught at first-
form level and to be regarded as an
alternative language to French in those
schools where it is taught rather than
as a second foreign language. Some
Victorian schools are also providing
extra - curricular Saturday morning
classes.
However, there seem some prospects
that relatively large numbers of Aus-
tralian teachers, and eventually pupils,
may study Indonesian. Mr. Bryan
Power, convener of the Indonesian sub-
committee of the Victorian Education
Department languages committee, feels
that Indonesian is the ideal language
for the majority of students, especially
those who find it difficult to cope with
French and German. “Australians are
remarkably good at Indonesian,” he
said.
Mr. Power feels that the Common-
wealth Department of Education and
Science seems to be taking some in-
terest in the teaching of Indonesian in
schools. He is hoping the Common-
wealth might come good with some
money along the lines of science grants,
although sums required for teaching
Indonesian could be much more modest.
He says that money is needed to ad-
vance teaching methods. Indonesian,,
he says, lends itself to audio-visual
teaching techniques, but these are more
expensive than simpler methods.
Rigby’s of Adelaide will launch an
Indonesian oral-aural textbook, com-
posed of 12 tape recordings and a
teacher-and-student manual, next
month. It is compiled by Mr. Eric
Baker, Miss Mary Lane, and Mr. J.
Ichsan, an Indonesian, and follows the
course they give at the Sydney Tech-
nical College language laboratory. The
same text is being used at Sydney
University. Five thousand sets are
being published, but at a cost of
$116.50. Without a grant few schools
could buy a course.
Japanese could reasonably be ex-
pected to be the next language on the
list of Asian priorities. However, an
Australian student of Japanese is far
more likely to be a businessman
struggling over his studies at a techni-
cal college at night than a school pupil
learning it at a time when learning for
most people is easier and certainly more
leisurely.
Japanese is taught in New South
Mrs. Retono, an Australian married to an Indonesian, takes a class in Indonesian
at Presbyterian Ladies’ College, Croydon, Sydney
Wales at only four State schools.
(Chinese is, apparently, taught in New
South Wales State schools only at
Canterbury Boys’ High School.)
Japanese is examined only for the
Higher School Certificate. However,
a visiting Japanese who taught at Port
Hacking High School, on the outskirts
of Sydney, said that the standard a
student reaches by Higher School
Certificate is “not worth examining.”
In Victoria, Japanese is a Leaving
Certificate subject 30 sat in 1966
but is not accepted for matriculation; it
is taught at only one or two Victorian
schools.
When the more difficult Asian
languages, such as Japanese and
Chinese, should 'be introduced into the
curriculum is still a subject for
academic debate. At Fort Street Boys’
High School, Sydney, which intro-
duced Japanese with a national teacher
in 1918, it is taught from second year,
but students in lower forms learn it on
a “voluntary basis.” Fort Street has
had an average of 15 students a year
since 1947, when classes were resumed
after the war. The school expects to
have about 52 students next year.
In a somewhat depressing picture
there are some individual bright spots,
generally carefully polished ! by an in-
dividual teacher. For example, Mel-
bourne’s Trinity Grammar has a
library of more than 100 books and
records in Indonesian, 26 students in
form three, 19 in form four, and begins
a leaving course next year. In forms
three and four Indonesian history and
geography are taught in English, but
next year for form five they will be
in Indonesian. As a random gesture,
the N.S.W. Joint Coal Board has an
annual scholarship, valued at $l5O, for
a Japanese language student at Higher
School Certificate level.
UNIVERSITIES LANGUAGE
STUDIES: The most recent and best
study bearing on the teaching of Asian
languages in Australian schools and
universities was undertaken by Dr.
Olive Wykes, senior lecturer in educa-
tion at the University of Melbourne, in
1964, for the Australian Humanities
Research Council, with some figures
updated to 1966.
Dr. Wykes was dealing with foreign
language teaching in general. Among
the points she made was the widespread
indifference, both inside and outside
universities, toward language study and
a pronounced idea among boys (this
particular part of the survey covered
Victoria only) that languages are “use-
less.” In Australian universities,
according to Dr. Wykes, the number
studying languages in faculties other
than Arts is negligible, while in Arts


the percentage is unlikely to be more
than 25, a low figure for Western-type
civilisations.
Dr. Wykes mentions the decline in
language-teaching in schools today
compared with prewar. Before 1939
virtually every State required a pass in
a foreign language for all public exam-
inations. Today in South Australia and
Western Australia foreign languages
have no value other than their own
worth. Foreign languages are taken by
only a minority of senior pupils
throughout Australia.
Dr. Wykes gathered replies from the
heads of departments in the faculties
of Arts, other than language depart-
ments, on their views of the value of
language teaching. Only three men-
tioned Asian languages. However,
many were enthusiastic about the idea
of institutes of languages, which make
use of language laboratories and which
might provide courses less literary than
those usually provided by language de-
partments and tailored for special
needs.
One questionnaire Dr. Wykes sent
out asked: “In establishing a course in
a new foreign language during the past
ten years, what determined the choice
of a language?” One Professor of In-
donesian remarked: “Australia is
farther from Calais than Dover and
we are at last beginning to realise it.”
“The creation of new departments is
accidental, reflecting the unworldly
nature of language departments,” was
the' acid comment of one history pro-
fessor.
There was the contrast between the
lofty, if debatable, view of one pro-
fessor, who said: “We are not interested
in Asian languages because they do
not have a large body of literature
behind them. They should be included
in area studies, for they are not com-
parable to a major European language,”
and a young professor in a new depart-
ment, whose view was that “a typical
mixture of cultural and practical
reasons is evidence in the introduction
of new languages. The practical argu-
ments advanced nowadays for the study
of foreign languages are to be welcomed
rather than deplored, since they make
skilled linguists and specialists in
foreign cultures valued members of the
community.”
In language in general in the uni-
versities, Dr. Wykes found that “piti-
fully” few took languages such as
Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.
Indonesian is taught at four univer-
sities: the Australian National Univer-
sity, Sydney, Melbourne, and Monash.
In all it has about 300 students, com-
pared with more than 3000 for French.
Because it is difficult for students to
take Indonesian at school, elementary
courses are necessary at university and
count as full first-year subjects. How-
ever, Dr. Wykes found a high drop-out
rate. Honors courses are being de-
veloped, but as yet there is virtually no
postgraduate work.
When Dr. Wykes compiled her
report, Japanese was taught only at
the ANU and Monash, with 58 pupils
between them. This, she considered, was
our greatest linguistic weakness. Chinese
was taught at the ANU, Sydney, and
Melbourne in 1966; these universities
had 119 students. However, in 1965,
Queensland added Japanese, and under
an enthusiastic professor, Professor
Joyce Ackroyd, who has three Japanese
nationals as senior tutors, it had 122
students in 1966, compared with 48 for
Latin. The department provides external
tuition and is establishing links with the
schools. Western Australia this year
established a Chair of Modern Japanese
Studies, under a grant from the mining
company Conzinc Rio Tinto.
The University of New South Wales’
Institute of Languages was established
this year (Queensland already has
language institutes). A Japanese
language course began last April and
makes use of a language laboratory.
More hopefully, however, Dr. Wykcs
found little support for the allegation
that there is no policy on the intro-
duction of new languages. Documents
submitted to her during the survey
showed evidence of much forward plan-
ning in the new universities and of the
establishment of sub-committees for
Asian languages.
The frailest link in the whole chain,
or the most difficult to forge, seems to
be that which joins the school to the
universities: teachers. Academics who
furnished answers to Dr. Wykes’ survey
were, true to traditional form, not much
concerned about what education
departments were likely to need or
what courses the departments were
likely to want as outlets for their pupils
on matriculation.
Dr. Wykes found that, on the whole,
the various education departments
permit their bonded students to take
only French, German, and Latin. There
have recently been some encouraging
signs, notably in Victoria and New
South Wales. In New South Wales last
year 45 graduate teachers went to the
Sydney Technical College language
laboratory for training in Indonesian.
However, the N.S.W. department is
running temporarily ahead of the needs
of the schools and not all the teachers
were placed, and not all those placed
have full teaching programs in Indo-
nesian. This year the Victorian Educa-
tion Department has a pilot training
program by allowing teachers with
proven ability at modern languages to
take time off to study Asian languages;
three are doing Indonesian at Mel-
bourne universities.
Summing up, Dr. Wykes said: “I am
going to stick my neck out here in
broaching this problem because I be-
lieve it is a vital one. I believe in the
greater diversification of language
teaching in the schools and univer-
sities of Australia. It is difficult to
attain this and if we persist in teach-
ing only French, German, and Latin
in the schools and if insigificant num-
bers of university students take all the
other languages put together, then some
pooling and distribution of resources
first within a State and ultimately
within Australia should at least be dis-
cussed.”
“A confused situation will continue
until there is a healthy ratio between
the number of students and teachers of
Indonesian,” said Mr. Eric Baker, head
of the Sydney Technical College
language school.
The technical colleges take on much
of the job of teaching businessmen and
others who have an immediate practical
need to learn something of an Asian
language. The Sydney Technical
College language department has classes
in Japanese, Indonesian, Mandarin and
Cantonese Chinese, and Vietnamese.
They have 160 students, mainly business
people, in the ten Japanese classes,
which are given by nationals; they
tackle characters at the end of the first
year. The Sydney Technical College has
180 people studying Indonesian.
Vietnamese is a one-year course,
which is mainly attended by senior
public servants and members of the
Army. There is only one class of 20.
It is more convenient for New South
Wales Service people to go here than
to the RAAF school for languages at
Point Cook, Victoria. Mr. Baker
wanted to begin a Thai course this
year, but couldn’t find a teacher, and
requests for tuition were small.
The Workers’ Educational Associa-
tion, which operates only in New South
Wales and South Australia, this year in
New South Wales has 45 students in
first-year Chinese, 52 in first-year Indo-
nesian, with 18 in the second-year
course, Indonesian language and litera-
ture, 75 in Japanese 1 (there were at
least 100 applicants to do the course),
and 14 in Japanese 2. The association
has 75 enrolled in its Asia, a back-
ground course, and 60 in the South-
East Asia courses, which are given in
the mornings at both Woollahra and
Manly.
At private language teaching
organisations, such as Berlitz, Lingua-
club, and Linguaphone, the demand is
often for some Japanese in a hurry, and
students are often businessmen. Lingua-
club, in Sydney, say that they have as
many learning Japanese now as learn
French. Linguaphone expect that a
recently released Japanese course of 16
records and four textbooks, costing $7B,
will eventually make up 25 percent of
their sales; a spokesman said “some
hundreds” of courses had already been
sold. The firm has researched the pros-
pects for Indonesian and believes that
if it introduced a course it could
make up ten percent of their sales.
With those who try to do-it-them-
selves entirely, Japanese is the most
popular choice. Edels Record Shop in
Sydney said that in six months they
have sold 30 Japanese courses, which
means it is running not far behind
French. If, after they leave school,
almost as many people find they have
to try to learn Japanese as try to learn
French, it seems evident that more
Japanese should be taught in the
schools.

After the siege
By DENIS O'BRIEN
THREE HUNDRED yards up the road
from the House of the Month, two
women are raking up the last of the
debris left by the Glenfield siege . . .
there’s a temptation to be more explicit,
but it’s hardly necessary. Glenfield is
now a synonym for crime-drama. Its
unwanted reputation might not last as
long as Glenrowan’s, but it will never
again quite be able to exist in the
figurative anonymity it had before July
1.
A car speeds down from the busy
crossroads three-quarters of a mile away
and is slowed as it approaches territory
made internationally familiar by a week
of words and pictures. Opposite the
grey fibro-board cottage that is 37
Glenfield Road and last week’s
cynosure the car comes to a momen-
tary stop. There is nothing unusual left
to see; superficially, this corner of
outer-Sydney suburbia is back to
normal. But curiosity and vicarious
involvement has been satisfied and the
car is accelerated. Many more will
seek out Glenfield Road in the next
weeks and months.
One of the women handling a rake
pauses and hrrmphs her shoulders in
an attitude of distaste. “It somehow
makes you feel ashamed,” she says,
helplessly and with an edge of anger
in her voice. “We’ve lived here for
years, my mother and I. No sanitary
service, no garbage collection, no foot-
path. It was almost as if nobody cared.
Now, that,” she gestures down the road,
“has brought the world out here. But
it hasn’t done us any good.”
She scratches the wire rake across
the hard earth and empties a pile of
leaves mixed with empty cigarette
packets, waxed paper, and curling
breadcrusts into a wheelbarrow full of
the same. An incinerator in the spacious
garden surrounding her neat home
already has devoured a mound of siege
rubbish; nearby, a bucket of bottles and
broken glass is waiting to be dumped.
The making and chronicling of social
history has become a messy business.
“No, you can’t use my name. We
don’t want to be any part of it. But
look at this footpath. Built it myself
with a mattock and that barrow there.
Now look at it cars and trucks have
been using it as part of the road. It
makes you sick.” Privacy has been
invaded by notoriety and defence
mechanisms are bristling in Glenfield.
Down in the shopping centre a
short line of low, clean stores opposite
the railway station a delicatessen
is filling a lunchtime order for sand-
wiches. “It was a nuisance,” says a
woman behind the counter. “And it
wasn’t any good for business, no matter
what anyone thinks. Cars couldn’t get
through the roadblock into Glenfield.
We’d like to forget about it all as
quickly as we can.”
Forgetting won’t be easy, even though
Glenfield shows no obvious signs of
remembering its origins, which are
rooted in Governor Macquarie’s open-
ing-up of the area. The place took its
name from the station property “Glen-
field,” which Charles Throsby created
from a land grant in the early 1800 s;
the railway station was opened in 1869.
Only a few old stone houses give a clue
to Glenfield’s past, though. Brick, and
painted timber and fibro neat, un-
obtrusive houses all suggest an un-
certain desire for progress . . . uncertain
because there seems no purpose in pro-
gress.
Glenfield, then, is a mixture of raw
newness and rural tranquillity. Sydney
is only 25 miles away, but if you stand
on the buffalo grass of 37 Glenfield
Road and shut your eyes and listen to
the birds in the tall native gums it
could be another, different, life away.
Down in the shopping centre, people
are anxious to point out that That Place
“isn’t actually in Glenfield at all”; it
is, as they say, on the way into Glen-
field, this side of the railway line, and
right on the very borderline of the
Campbelltown municipality. The geo-
graphic point is merely defensive. Glen-
field itself is really only a little town-
ship on the way to somewhere else
Macquarie Fields (where Wally Mellish
was born), Ingleburn (with its Army
camp), Minto (where sculptor Tom
Bass lives and works), and Campbell-
town (where last week they were con-
gratulating themselves on the success
of this year’s Festival of Fisher’s Ghost
and preparing for the 1969 festival).

Commonwealth Inquiry
into
Awards in Colleges
of Advanced Education
A Committee of Inquiry has been initiated by the Commonwealth Minister
for Education and Science to inquire into awards in colleges of advanced
education. Persons and organisations who wish to place information or make
representations before the Committee regarding the aspects of the naming and
standards of awards in colleges which are the subject of the inquiry are invited
to do so.
The Committee will be assisted if persons and organisations who wish to place
information or make representations prepare written submissions setting out in
detail the information and related material they wish the Committee to
consider. These written submissions should be forwarded to the Secretary,
Inquiry into Awards in Colleges of Advanced Education, P.O. Box 826, Canberra
City, A.C.T. 2601, before 29th July, 1968. Any material clearly marked
“Confidential” will be treated as confidential by the Committee.
The Committee has been appointed with the following terms of reference—
“to inquire into and make recommendations on
(il) The desirability of conformity in nomenclature for
awards in colleges of advanced education and, if con-
sidered desirable, the steps appropriate to achieve this
conformity.
(2) The criteria which should be applied to the assessment
of courses designed to qualify students for awards at
various levels.
(3) The nomenclature to be used for awards.
(4) The nature and modus operand! of a possible body
to advise on comparability of standards in awards.”

stands back from the road on a large
block with a wide, comfortable garden
in the front and an untidy straggle of
outbuildings at the back.
A little of the litter of its infamous
week is still scattered around it, but only
48 hours after the end of the siege
most of the traces have been erased.
A screen door in the front of the house
slaps closed as a man in overalls comes
out mixing filling with which to plug
assorted bulletholes in the fibro walls.
How many bulletholes? He’s not
saying.
Inside, the house is dark, quiet.
Through the screen door it looks like
the interior of dozens of vaguely
remembered simple homes: modestly
furnished, a place in which to exist
without abrasive hardship. It’s difficult
not to stare and look for significance.
After all, tourists are still looking for
signs of blood in the Bloody Tower.
The plastic flowers are still in their
vase on the table over which a clergy-
man married Wally Mellish and his
hostage, Beryl Muddle. On the wall
behind the table hangs a colored photo
strip of calendar girl models. If Mellish
put down his guns for the wedding,
were the sexy photos put away, too?
Outside on the road, another car is
slowing down. A head is poked out of
the window . . . “There it is, over
there.” Silence. A voice inside the
car says, “Come on, let’s go. We’ve
seen all there is to see.” Glenfield
Road residents will have to become
accustomed to such fruitless curiosity.
Land is for sale on either side of the
road. “It’s a good healthy area to raise
kids,” says a man at the bar in the
Cross Roads Hotel, “but it’ll take a time
before anyone will want to buy land out
here, I bet. That madman didn’t
exactly do us much good.”
Yet there is a sort of grudging
sympathy for Mellish out at Glenfield.
He is a son of the area and he’s not
entirely being blamed for the stain he
has left. “He couldn’t help himself,
poor coot.”
In the bar Police Commissioner
Allan is being briefly tried in absentia.
“The man was grandstanding” . . .
“I reckon he did the right thing” . . .
“There was more lies told in a week
down the road than you’d hear in
Parliament in a year.” Verdict is sus-
pended. The subject already is close
to being talked out.
In the parking area one man calls to
another, “Seems strange not seeing
coppers all over the place, stopping
cars. Wish they’d come out again to
stop the bloody tourists.”
And in the local newspaper there’s a
Page 3 item about casting for a forth-
coming Campbelltown Theatre Group
production of “Annie Get Your Gun.”
The irony isn’t appreciated in the
pub. “Leave us alone—and just hope
to God it doesn’t happen next door to
you.”


Will Thailand come in out of
the American umbrella?
By
DENNIS BLOODWORTH
Australian engineers on a road-building project in north-east Thailand
help bring Bangkok closer to a remote province
In 1962 American troops flew into Thailand to
reinforce the Thais against Communist guerillas.
Now the Thais ask: will they stay?
AS SAIGON braces itself for the shock
of the next Viet Cong onslaught, the
Communist executors of a “Thailand
next” strategy are directing terrorism
in this country from a secret head-
quarters possibly in the area of Dien
Bien Phu, Thai officials have surmised.
Intelligence indicates that a control
group, which is believed to include
Chinese and Vietnamese cadres, is send-
ing instructions through neighboring
Laos to key agents of the Communist
Party of Thailand in Bangkok itself.
These are financed by local Left-wing
Chinese and are responsible for main-
taining contact with the different zones
of insurrection throughout Thailand.
The first modern Soviet-designed
A.K.47 automatic rifles have been cap-
tured by Thai security forces. Experts
argue that this suggests the existence of
secret caches of up-to-date Russian or
Chinese arms smuggled into the country
for a more violent future. Hitherto the
guerilla movement has fought only with
the weapons of World War 11, in order
to preserve its image among villagers
as a spontaneous uprising of down-
trodden Thais, not an armed con-
spiracy supplied and directed from
abroad.
For the same reason the 1800
guerillas operating in the impoverished
north-east corner of the country, where
the Mekong River marks the indefen-
sible frontier with Laos, are drawn
from Thai villages and not from among
the 60,000-strong community of dis-
affected Vietnamese refugees in the
region. But while more than 500 Thai
cadres have been instructed in sub-
version and terrorism in a special school
at Hoa Binh, in North Vietnam, and
later filtered down again into the
maquis, I learn that recruits from the
Vietnamese minority have also been
pulled out for training and then
slipped back into their own villages in
Thailand. Their role has not been to
fight a hit-and-run war in the teak-
studded scrublands of the north-east,
however, for that would discredit a
movement advertised as “Thai” and
“patriotic.” At present it is only to
indoctrinate and develop the Viet-
namese villages as centres of support,
food, funds, and information for the
armed Thai insurgents.
Q n the south-west border with
Malaysia, at the other end of the
country, where guerillas ambushed a
police convoy two weeks ago and
mowed down more than 30 men, the
hard core of some 600 Malaysian in-
surgents who withdrew across the
frontier into Thailand eight years ago-
is also gradually giving way to a new r
generation of recruits who are Thai
nationals. Startled Malaysian and Thai
security officials are expected to agree
that troops of both countries must be
allowed to hunt their elusive common
enemy on both sides of the border in
future.
Thin, but spreading, the pattern of
armed struggle is now part of the
political climate not only in the north-
east and on the Malaysian frontier but
also in the north and on the border
with Burma.
Taking their line from Radio Peking
and the unlocated “Voice of the People
of Thailand,” the gunmen of the “Thai
Patriotic Front” number between 2500
and 3000 and are actively supported, it
is calculated, by up to 25,000 sym-
pathisers, but they work in about 90
separate small squads, most of them
only 10 or 15 strong.
Co-ordinating the counter-insurgency
operations of 20,000 troops, police, and
civilian specialists in the north-east
alone, the Communist Suppression
Operations Command and Army chiefs
in Bangkok have tried to isolate the
terrorists from the villages, leaving them
in the brush and jungle where local
military strike forces can hunt them
down. Accordingly, it has put lightly
armed teams of volunteer defence corps
and police into the villages with radio
contact to a central combined head-
quarters set up in each of the ten
sensitive “target areas” notorious for
terrorism. “The system wouldn’t work
in Vietnam,” a Thai general told me
frankly this week. “We just hope that
it is going to be different here.”
The hope is based on the fact that
Thailand is not ex-colonial territory
eager to welcome a Communist move-
ment in the guise of a movement for
“national liberation,” but an indepen-
dent kingdom in which the people are
loyal to their monarch and their
Buddhist faith. The ten million people
in the north-east have not suffered from
“imperialist oppression” but from
neglect and nature.
Much of the year, half of their vil-
lages are marooned by floods and are
inaccessible, while in the dry season the
mean soil crumbles to dust, and the
land is afflicted with drought. Rising
Thai doctors, technicians, or agronom-
ists have declined to waste their time

and talents on this unrewarding out-
back, and it has failed to inspire pro-
vincial administrators with much in-
terest in its welfare in the past.
When the insurgency began, one vil-
lage chief went three times to the
district authority to report in vain the
presence of armed terrorists, and was
finally assassinated for his pains before
any move was made against them. Iso-
lated and seemingly abandoned, most
villagers connived with the Communists
not for love of subversion, but of sur-
vival. Making little more than $36 a
year in their remote rural slum, others
joined the guerillas in the hope of a
better life, only to find that the Com-
munists had no ideological answer to
floods and drought.
The first task of the Thai Govern-
ment, backed by about $U.5.135 mil-
lion a year in American military and
economic aid, has been to show that it
exists. When villagers report theix
needs and fears it must, above all, “do
something,” officials emphasise. This
has yielded its own crop of follies,
from supplying barefoot peasants with
sharp-shouldered Western spades to
bombing Meo villages on the basis of
local reports that they harbored Com-
munist infiltrators the bombing
added several hundred angry and
rebellious hill tribesmen to the
original force of about 150 Meo ter-
rorists trained by the Laotian Leftists
across the northern border.
Nevertheless, the current combin-
ation of faith and works, of protecting
the villager to give him confidence
and providing him with roads and wells
and drugs and schools, has at least paid
off in statistics. Last year the guerillas
were assassinating local officials and
village headmen at the rate of ten a
month and making armed propaganda
forays into villages two or three times
a week. So far this year their killing
average has dropped to a little over
four a month and their propaganda
incursions to fewer than one a week.
The mood is uneasy, however. The
Americans have 43,000 men in Thai-
land, but their military effort is directed
toward the bombing of North Viet-
namese and Viet Cong targets. While
this suits the Thais, who prefer the
struggle for Thailand to be fought out
in Vietnam, it arouses fears that if a
settlement is reached over Saigon the
Americans may see no point in stay-
ing in this country.
On the other hand, diplomatic
observers say, it may be dangerous if
they do. For if Washington stopped
backing the anti-Communist Govern-
ment in an already divided Laos, and
Ho Chi Minh’s writ ran as far as the
banks of the Mekong and the wide
open border of Thailand, the insur-
gency here would pick up irresistible
momentum. Bangkok would certainly
want to cry quits and establish a live-
and-let-live relationship with a sus-
picious Hanoi, and the comforting
American umbrella of today would then
become an unwieldly, compromising,
and embarrassing impediment.

Why have an Australian Theatre?
By PETER O'SHAUGHNESSY
WHAT WILL THE 70s BRING?
After four decades of vicissitudes, Australian theatre still has an uncertain future.
1930s Madge Elliott and Cyril
Ritchard (above in “Private Lives”)
helped sustain Australian theatre in the
’30s in a succession of lighthearted plays
1940s Max Oldaker (above as the
Red Shadow in “Desert Song”) con-
tributed to the escapism which still
dominated Australian theatre in the '40s
1950s Ray Lawler’s “Summer of
the 17th Doll” was the play which, in
the ’50s, gave a new promise for an
indigenous Australian theatre
1960s Ross Thompson, Patricia
Leehy in Thomas Keneally’s “Hal-
loran’s Little Boat,” one of a few sig-
nificant Australian dramas of the ’60s
JOHN OSBORNE has spoken of his
loathing of the current tendency toward
“democratisation of the arts.” Ken-
neth Tynan quoted this recently in the
London “Observer,” after attending a
“total ' theatre” melee given by the
Grand Theatre Panique of Paris at: the
Mercury Theatre in London. A goat
excreted on the stage; an actor’s
genitals were flourished (Tynan felt
some puritan inconsistency in the girls’
failure to make an equally audacious
gesture); and the players set about
demolishing Fernando Arrabal’s play-
destruction being the essential nature
of the exercise. “To the tumbrils with
the wordsmiths” was the war cry. As
the audience were prodded, goaded,
and threatened by the bilingual players,
Tynan tells us of how he fingered
his cigarette lighter in case the clammy
foot of one of the actors became
imminent enough to let him make his
gesture of defiance.
When the two high-priests of Eng-
land’s theatrical revolution begin to
show their distaste for theatrical
“Dadaism” we might start to ask a
few questions about what is meant by
theatrical “progress,” though, as a
matter of fact, Tynan has never been
an avant-garde bandwagoner; more of
an apostle for didactic theatre of the
social realist kind taking up the
cause of Brecht against lonesco,
Beckett, and even, at times, Pinter.
One of England’s finest producers,
Joan Littlewood, was so keen to put
the “fun” back into drama and
did so, what’s more that she pro-
claimed her desire to get out of drama
altogether and build a great “Fun
Palace” in North London where people
could get together and have a good
old rowdy time.
I suppose that “Fun Palace” would
have earned John Osborne’s descrip-
tion of “democratisation of the arts.”
Here the artist would forfeit any pre-
tensions to responsibility or to any
more special knowledge of the subject
in hand than the spectators might
have. No doubt Osborne also had in
mind the dislike of “literature” in the
theatre and the cult of inarticulacy. The
logical end to manic progressivism in
the theatre is that drama as we know
it would become extinct and be suc-
ceeded by ritualism: carnivals and
bacchanalia. Thus would the circle be
rounded and the original Dionysian
Festivals restored to their pristine
purity: blood would be shed, the actors
would retreat from their bourgeois im-
personations of “character” into the
throng of the celebrants while the pro-
ducer would whip it all up.
The paradox about the “theatre of
violence” is that while it aims at popu-
lar involvement to the point of hectic
physical participation on football-
ground terms, it might eventually suc-
ceed in driving audiences away from
the theatres to the stadiums and even
the bullrings and to the football
grounds. So why have a theatre?
Perhaps the most exciting and posi-
tive thing about the theatre outside
Australia is that it now admits all
the doctrines without committing itself
to any one of them. In other words, in
recent years, it has become a place
or an occasion for a remarkable diver-
sification of activity.
It required a genius like Brecht to
make the most catholic of all state-
ments about theatrical doctrine a
much more impressive statement than
the “alienation” theory: “If it works,
it works.”
It would be nice if the Australian
theatre was all agog with arguments
about the nature of theatre and cinema
in modern society, but the truth is that
there is a deathly hush, broken occas-
ionally by the doctrinal urgings of a
few academic critics and a very few
young producers (where are all the
young producers, by the way? There
are ominously few of them) and one
or two film critics preaching the
sanctity of the medium and the threat
of interbreeding with the other arts.
, . .
Theies not much point m recoin-
mending separatism until pioliferation
occurs, and what real meaning is there
to a ievolution when we haven t yet
attained to a constitution.
The best reason for having a theatre
here is that the public show every in-
dication of wanting to go to the theatre.
In Sydney at present there is enough
theatrical activity. Yet, in the whole
country and the course of my work
has given me a rare opportunity to
survey the national scene there is
only one company of players that
could hold its own internationally, and
that is the Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany.
That old social phenomenon, the
theatre, just won’t lie down for dead,
It is certainly no good pretending that
the reason why we should have a
theatre is that the artists of the theatre
are just burning to say something. John
Osborne would regard them as
thoroughly “democratised,” that is to
say “intimidated.” They will not even
campaign for a roof over their heads,
Never was I more aware of the
deathly hush among the artists of the
theatre than when drama is in the

As a professional I am a great be-
circumstantial factors. The
hrst . thin § tbat drama needs her< : lf Jt
« going to flourish is a generous home,
In Sydney there is not one theatre
available to stage drama in a generous,
proud way, without compromising
rights to tenancy. Recently it was sug-
gested to me that I reproduce my pro-
duction of “The Recruiting Officer”
done for the Adelaide University
Theatre Guild at the last Adelaide Fes-
tival. I had to decline because I know
of no suitable stage available. The way
things are going at the Opera House
now it seems that drama may survive
in a rather claustrophobic outhouse
with as many formal limitations in
staging as one might find in an average
church hall. And, after the expenditure
from public funds of $5O million plus,
who is going to be able to wheedle
more money from the public purse to
build a drama theatre capable of any
versatility in its staging resources?
The hangdog mentality, the “grate-
ful for small mercies” attitude in the
custodians of drama in this country,
probably derives from the fact that,
until recently, all drama of any pre-
tensions was in the hands of amateurs.
And (again I except the Melbourne
Theatre Company) the course toward
professional drama has been an agonis-
ing “inching” process away from the
.strictures of amateur theatre.
Then we have to consider that,
although the choice of modern plays to
be performed here is made from a
short list of European and American
successes (I don’t see anything in that
to complain about), our producers are
isolated from the one absolutely pro-
gressive development in theatre abroad,
i.e., the architectural development. This
is another circumstantial factor that is
greatly debated among theatrical artists
in other countries.
Drama may be a minority art form,
but it is important that it should not
declare itself to the public as such.
This does not mean an acceptance of
any crude formula such as “the king-
size is best,” but it does mean that cer-
tain hardheaded “showbiz” factors are
elemental in the design of drama
theatres today: bars and restaurants are
important, noiseless (yes, noiseless), air-
conditioning and heating are important,
and so is legroom. A feeling of
intimacy is important, but. a good
designer must reconcile this with the
ceremonial element in drama.
If we take a long view of the history
of building theatres we will see that
theatres have usually tried to give
architectural expression to the com-
munal nature of the occasion for
drama. In Europe today most new
theatres do not wholly contain the pic-
ture of the action within a rectangular
frame. Although producers tend to
reject, ,or reserve judgment about,
“theatre in the round,” there is no
doubt that most of them want to in-
duce the spectator to feel that the
action of the play physically impinges
on the audience; hence the use of
“apron” stages which thrust into the
auditorium and raked seats which
emphasise the sculptural relationship
of the performers to each other and,
correspondingly, reduce the pictorial
importance of the background.
It would be putting it conservatively
to say that most modern producers of
drama in Europe or America want_to
modify the “picture frame” concept.
The motives for this may not always
flow from the purest artistic springs
but often from practical “showbiz”
considerations: “If the cinema boys
have taken over the picture frame let
them have it. Let us move on.” At a
higher level, though, the reasoning
might be something like this: “We don’t
go overboard for ‘theatre in the round.’
That is too democratic altogether. But
we recognise that the public want to
get a physical experience out of the
theatre just as people who look at
paintings want to get something like
a tactile experience and not just a
visual one. Therefore, we have to do all
we can to make what might still be a
two-dimensional experience feel like
a three-dimensional one.”
Alan Seymour, now an expatriate,
wrote in “Masque” a few months
ago: “Australian national theatre . . .
needs room for large spectacular plays
and smaller, riskier, or just different
plays. It needs to admit frankly and
joyfully that theatre is an art, the great
social art, and that art is a pleasure. It
also needs to eschew the easy slickness
and superficial professionalism which so
many Australian actors and directors
would be content to settle for. With the
gradual disappearance, at last,' of the
radio-conditioned generation of Aus-
tralian actors with their dreary beery
‘l’m just a journalist’ attitude, there
may be chance of new attitudes. It
will be an interesting day when an
Australian actor can say with neither
reticence nor defiance, ‘I am an artist’.”
In Australia, those whom Shake-
speare called “the abstracts and brief
chronicles of the time” would rarely
presume to dignify their calling by
claiming what most actors in the world
would not hesitate to assert: that their
study is human behaviour and that they
presume to have a special sort of
insight into human nature. Of course
if an actor doesn’t presume this far he
is open to the charge that he is really
only a sort of salesman with a knack
or a flair. It is true that the bulk of the
work done by Australian actors and
actresses does entail either direct or
indirect selling of anything from trac-
tors to toilet paper and that perhaps a
majority of actors are better equipped
to go on doing this instead of helping
to realise the works of Shakespeare,
Moliere, Ibsen, Miller, Shaw, Beckett,
lonesco, Osborne, Pinter, and Brecht.
It is even true that there are many
of them unacquainted with the works
of half those playwrights.
But it is curious, to say the least,
that most of our theatre Utopians and
“bring back Utzonites” take no account
of this and that those who dispense
subsidies never consider that very little
of this money finds its way into the
actors’ pockets. Last year the N.S.W.
Drama Foundation received about
$33,000 from the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust (just to balance the record let
me say that this year the “Q” Theatre
had its tiny subsidy from the Trust
withdrawn altogether pending “policy”
changes) as well as other subsidies;
and yet the actors rehearsing a classical
play for The Old Tote Theatre will not
be able to attend all the rehearsals
desired by the producer because they
have to do “commercials” in order to
bring their earnings up to par. In any
other country with serious aspirations


to drama this situation would be re-
garded as intolerable.
This “salesman” view of the actor
is even held by some producers and
critics who regard expressions of in-
dividuality from an actor as evidence
of a “difficult” person. When I produce
plays I look hopefully for such “dif-
ficult” persons, but they’re not easy to
find. The system has often tamed the
actors into believing that I, as a
producer, will regard “opinions” as
heretical or an incipient sign of re-
bellion. In the English theatre it is an
unspoken law, indeed a tradition, that
a play will develop as a result of a
dialogue between producer and actor.
If the producer is no good it is even
possible that the actors will gently
take the play out of his hands there
need be no hint of rebellion in this
very English process and make a
“production” of it themselves.
It seems to be a puritan heritage,
this suspicion of actors. Perhaps it
calls for a playwright of the Theatre of
the Absurd to give expression to the
exquisite paradox whereby $5O million
will be spent on a building to include
two theatres and a concert hall, while
an organisation called the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust (the intention was surely
to evoke the spirit of the Titan among
playwrights) shamelessly washes its
hands of drama and with scarcely a
sound of protest heard anywhere. Mean-
while, some of our best actors and
actresses have to preoccupy themselves
with commercials.
I have thought it an interesting clue
to the status of the actor in this country
that, in my social junketings, as a pro-
ducer at such events as the Adelaide
Festival of Arts, I have often looked
around in vain, through the glint of
the champagne glasses and the tiaras,
for a sign of a fellow actor. Opera
singers? In abundance. Musicians!
Painters! But not an actor in sight. The
policy of the Adelaide Festival of Arts
was not to issue Festival Club cards to
any local actor.
As a producer and occasional writer
I am, myself, in the clear. As an actor
I am definitely liable to suspicion:
“Why do you do one-man shows?”
asks a young academic with theatrical
pretensions. The accusing glint in the
eye implies: “Doesn’t that make you
a queer sort of fish? Isn’t it vaguely
indecent? Egotistical? Narcissistic? I
suspect you of actually enjoying all
that dressing-up business. Aren’t you
building up a cult around your own
personality? Oughtn’t you to belong to
an ensemble?”
There is no word in the theatre that
gathers more cant and piety about it
than that word “ensemble.” Of course,
“an ensemble” is a marvellous idea if
you pay the actors enough money, but
the word often masks an aggressive
egalitarianism and a demand for the
anonymity of the actor. “It is not the
policy of our theatre to feature stars,”
says a director. Then he pulls out his
humbugging word “ensemble.” What he
often means is that the policy is to
feature the producer as star.
I never yet heard of a solo violinist
being asked why he didn’t confine his
activities to the anonymity of the
orchestral ranks. It was refreshing to
hear Max Adrian replying recently to
a critic that an advantage of doing one-
man shows was that it was a relief to
be free from “all that arrogance and
ignorance” '. . . “of upstart producers”
was the implication.
Many of the public and even some
critics have little idea of what the “pro-
duction” is when they try to assess the
performance of a play. It is important
that they should know only in so far as
they are in a position to make recom-
mendations. It will help if a producer
knows a lot about literature, painting,
music, sculpture, but, above all, he
needs to know a lot about acting. And
so do film directors.
Strange that this essential knowledge
should rarely be given high priority
here in the consideration of the qualifi-
cations for a producer. Most of the
world’s best directors have been actors,
some very good, some not so good.
In France, most of'"the best directors
continue to work as actors; in England,
although few directors still function
as actors, most have studied act-
ing. Almost every dramatic academy
in Europe insists that the first
year of the directors’ course should
consist exclusively of a study of the
art of acting.
Yet Australia’s only full-time drama
academy and I am not in a mood
to “knock” it since it seems to be pro-
ducing a pretty healthy crop of young
actors makes no similar stipulation
in its producers’ course. Considering
the standard of acting in this coun-
try, one might have hoped that the
emphasis might be greater rather than
less. Under present conditions a pro-
ducer’s work often involves a certain
amount of teaching actors the rudi-
ments of the actor’s art.
Looking back to the foundation of
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1954
one can see now that we went through
a phony “theatrical renaissance,”
which was cooked up by various cheer
leaders. Our expectations from the
writer were phenomenal. The re-
sponsibility was his to chart a new
course for the Australian theatre. I
suppose it is an occupational tendency
for the critic to want to promote the
writer, but I wonder if Ray Lawler
and Alan Seymour had chosen to stay
on here whether they could have stood
the strain. Anything less than a master-
piece might have been interpreted as a
sign of declining powers.
A pity that we didn’t ask the ques-
tion: “Why have a theatre?” ten years
ago. Perhaps a more provoking way of
putting it would have been: “A theatre
—why?” It’s said that people get the
sort of government they deserve and
so it might be argued that we got the
Opera House and the Australian Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust because we de-
served them. And we deserved them
because they had no more specific
artistic aims than to put Australia on the
cultural map. In other words, cultural
snobbery lay behind it all.
What’s in a name? It’s interesting to
speculate on what might have hap-
pened if both of these projects had
been given more practical, matter-of-
fact names to describe their functions.
“Opera” and “Elizabethan” betray
status concepts. “Covent Garden”
derives its name from a fruit and
vegetable market; “the Old Vic” used
to be a music hall and a pretty low-
life one at that; “the Abbey” was a
morgue. Still, I am not really advocat-
ing that we should have dredged up
a name from the nineteenth century. All
that would have yielded is a “Theatre
Royal” or a “Her Majesty’s.” No, that
wouldn’t have done. Nor would I be
in favor of “Colonial Playhouse.” Per-
haps we haven’t done too badly with
names like “The Emerald Hill
Theatre” and “The Old Tote.” Mel-
bourne Theatre Company is pretty
good and downright. I would have been
quite happy to swop “Australian
Elizabethan Theatre Trust” for the
“Drama, Ballet, and Opera Founda-
tion,” but it’s too late for that now,
since the AETT slunk away from
drama altogether.
Despite the miserable record of
waste and folly I have hardly
touched on it, really the prospect
isn’t gloomy and despondent. Per-
haps I am like the old wife who says
things couldn’t be worse so they’re
bound to be better tomorrow; or like
the Marxist faithfuls who believe in the
holy writ that revolution is inevitable.
I have the feeling that the “culture
explosion” is inevitable. It has hap-
pened for painting, now it’s the
theatre’s turn. While the AETT dedi-
cates itself almost exclusively to 19th-
century theatrical extravaganzas sung
in alien tongues, the Council for the
Arts is formed. And, what’s more,
they’re an impressive body of in-
formed people who can be expected to
be more interested in the assignment
than in lending their names.
Two new professional Reps, have
got going in Sydney during the past
nine months; Brisbane used to be fobbed
off with promises by the AETT
perhaps they’ll try the Council for the
Arts now; the AETT’s having another
shot in Adelaide. If Don Dunstan gets
back and that seems likely he
has great plans for the theatre, and
concrete plans at that. Rumor has it
that Perth’s professional Rep. is
threatened with reversion to amateur
status. They might try the Council
for the Arts, too. And Hobart? Well,
I hope they’ll resist the AETT’s “sham
professional” recommendations and
settle for a lump sum instead of another
AETT appointee. Canberra has a good
amateur movement. Don’t fly too high
there! More money to improve the
amateur movement. Melbourne has the
St. Martin’s Theatre. Then there’s the
Melbourne Theatre Company, which
has proved that it can be done.
Now what about a National Theatre!
And I’m not pretending to have a
disinterested voice.


HAWKER SIDDELEY
FINANCIAL YEAR 1967
For some time we have been in, and still are in, a period in which the
state of the economy both in the United Kingdom and overseas, affects
our activities adversely. Although the ‘freeze’ in the U.K. slowed down
the upward trend of costs, it did not stop it, and we are now in the period
in which many costs will increase following devaluation. War in the
Middle East slowed our substantial export business in that area,
although recovery is now becoming evident. There have been signs
throughout the period of a tendency to contraction in the tempo of
world trade in some of our products. The effect of the severe cancella-
tions of military aerospace projects in 1965 continues to be felt and
the more recent cuts in U.K. defence expenditure have inevitably
affected our military business. The reduction of the rate of investment
in the U.K. in electrical generating capacity has affected, and will
continue to affect for some time, that part of our electrical business
associated with generation and distribution.
We have continued to bring about the rationalisation of manufacturing
capacity and the concentration of activity in accord with the work load
in all our sectors. In parallel with these concentrations and rationalisa-
tion of management structure and resources in the interests of efficiency,
considerable extensions are proceeding in other parts of the business,
both in the U.K. and overseas. The company has continued its policy
of committing a high level of capital expenditure, particularly in
modern machinery, in order to improve productivity and reduce costs.
All these factors have inevitably been reflected in changes in the return
earned on the capital employed in our various activities. Aerospace
activities in the U.K. have broadly maintained their position. Industrial
earnings in the U.K. diminished a little in 1967; plant and transformers
in the electrical sector were relatively poor, though other electrical
products improved. Diesel engines fell back somewhat in 1967,
reflecting particularly diminution in export demand in the Middle East
area and diminution in the U.K. demand. Both tendencies are now
improving. Activities in Metals improved their position in a difficult
market.
However, these variations were relatively small in comparison with
two major changes, both in Canada. As predicted last year, The
de Havilland Aircraft of Canada moved back into substantial profita-
bility, reflecting particularly the receipt of income from the McDonnell
Douglas Corporation under the agreement with them previously
reported, and the effect of new aircraft moving into production.
Hawker Siddeley Canada (59% participation) moved into a serious
loss position—largely accounted for by losses generated in its 77%
subsidiary, Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation Limited (Dosco).
An agreement was concluded in 1967 between the Province of Nova
Scotia and Dosco under which the steel plant at Sydney, Nova Scotia,
was sold to the Sydney Steel Corporation. Additionally, an agreement
in principle has now been reached with Siderurgie de Quebec (Sidbec)
under which, subject to all necessary consents and to contracts, Sidbec
will make an offer for all the shares of Dosco, and Hawker Siddeley
Canada Ltd. will purchase from Dosco the undertakings and assets of
its non-steel activities. It is expected that if this arrangement becomes
effective, and following other steps that have already been taken
including the disposal of the Sydney Works, the profit contribution in
a full year from the reorganised Hawker Siddeley Canada would
represent a reasonable return on the reduced figure of net assets.
AUSTRALIA
hawker de havilland Australia pty. ltd. Sales showed an increase
of more than 20% compared with 1966 and reflect a growing volume
of production in respect of the Macchi trainer aircraft, the Viper engine
and other new defence contracts.
Engine overhaul facilities have been increased by the addition of new
facilities in Perth, Western Australia, which have been opened recently.
The aerospace industry is continuing to expand; Hawker de Havilland
is in the forefront of the industry in Australia and is therefore strongly
placed to participate in this development.
hawker siddeley brush pty. ltd. During the year this company
completed the installation of the largest diesel generating station in the
Southern Hemisphere at Hamersley in Western Australia. Substantial
orders were also obtained in 1967 by this company for the Group’s
industrial factories in the United Kingdom.
hawksley products pty. ltd. This company, which manufactures
aluminium window frames and provides a servicing facility for auto-
mobile bumper bar replacement, had a satisfactory year. Future
prospects are good and manufacturing facilities have been extended.
hawker siddeley building supplies pty. ltd. Although the timber
division has felt the effect of a reduced level of activity in house
building, an increase in industrial building and in multi-storey housing
units has been of benefit to the brick division which has shown an
increase in sales compared with 1966. A further increase in brick sales
is expected in 1968.
CROMPTON PARKINSON (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD., NOYES BROS. PTY. LTD.,
noyes manufacturing pty. ltd. In the electrical industry conditions
have been difficult and competition has been particularly severe in the
transformer market. An improvement is expected in 1968, especially
in the market for electric motors, as conditions are becoming more
buoyant.
lister blackstone pty. ltd. This company, which manufactures
sheep-shearing equipment and assembles and markets diesel engines,
is expanding its activities.
Taking the Hawker Siddeley Group as a whole, the present year is
bringing opportunities in the export market following devaluation of
sterling, but considerable obscurity, pending experience, remains on
the future of the economy in the U.K. and particularly on how costs
will move. However, we expect to see the Group at least maintaining
and possibly improving its position.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Some golden manoeuvres
DESPITE MANOEUVRES of the
South African Government to the con-
trary, now apparently outwitted, the
two-tier gold market seems to be stand-
ing up remarkably well as an interim
measure while a more sophisticated
solution to world liquidity is estab-
lished. i
The International Monetary Fund’s
plan to create “special drawing rights”
(essentially IMF book entries, much
like bank loans or overdrafts) to swell
the international currency market
alongside gold, dollars, and sterling is
already well under way. The 107 IMF
countries have been sent the text of the
scheme and agreement of 67 countries
with a total of 80 percent of the voting
power to establish it has been obtained.
But it is not thought possible to bring
special drawing rights into operation
before next year.
In the meanwhile, since March, South
Africa has been withholding gold from
both the free and official markets in an
attempt to drive up the price on the
free market.
It was a somewhat irresponsible
move. The success of the two-tier mar-
ket depends, of course, on the free-
market price not getting too far out of
line with the official price, so tempting
governments to cash in their dollars for
gold and undermine still further the
world’s monetary system. The two-tier
system is very much a calculated risk
on the part of the central bankers and
yet to the South African move they
appeared indifferent. Bland comment
from Zurich in April simply stated that
the South Africans would be in for a
long wait which they could ill afford.
N v o foreseeable South African external
payments surplus, it was pointed out,
would be big enough to absorb all that
country’s newly mined gold into the
national reserves.
This fallacy in the South African
manoeuvre became apparent only too
quickly and recent approaches to the
central European banks and the IMF
have been offering freshly mined South
African gold at $35 an ounce for their
monetary reserves. Tempting though
the offer was, it was refused. Last week
the bankers seized their advantage.
The free-market price of gold had
risen to about $44 an ounce and then
more or less settled between $4O and
$4l. This, the bankers suggested, was
too high to guarantee future stability
for the system. So the South Africans
should start selling on the free market
and when the price had dropped closer
to the official price some suggested
around $36 to $37 would be about
right then some of the central Euro-
pean banks and perhaps the IMF would
take additional quantities at the official
price. The announcement was timed to
coincide with that on the new support
arrangements for sterling.
Following the announcement, the price
of gold in London on Tuesday of last
week had its sharpest decline ever from
$40.60 to $39.80 an ounce, the first
time gold had sunk below $4O since
May 14. In Zurich the picture was the
same. And even in Paris, the free price
dropped a massive $1.52 to close at
$43.71.
Some slight recovery on the Wednes-
day was knocked firmly on the head
the following day by a narrowed trade
gap for Britain and a $l3OO million
support plan for France. Touching a
low of $39.10 the free price of gold in
London closed the week at $39.30. It
has some way to go yet before the
central bankers will start dealing with
South Africa again.
AVIATION INDUSTRY
DISSIPATION
ARTHUR GREGG, Victorian secre-
tary of the Association of Architects,
Engineers, Surveyors, and Draughts-
men, has been voicing the concern of a
swelling band of people who are inter-
ested in Australia’s defence capacity.
They argue that streamlined adminis-
tration must be accompanied by intense
development of our technological and
industrial wherewithal.
A resolution passed on July 4 by the
federal executive of the Council of
Salaried and Professional Associations
firmly criticised the Government in
much the same terms as the AAESD has
used in the past two months. The
motion of the 300,000-strong organisa-
tion expressed “alarm that a vital sec-
tion of Australian industry is being
allowed to decline” while huge sums
were being spent on foreign aircraft.
The AAESD’s immediate concern
has been over the dismissals of more
than 100 lower-scale tradesmen at Mel-
bourne’s Government Aircraft Factory
early in May. The GAF management
also told shop stewards at the time
that further retrenchment might have
to be considered.
The official view of the Department
of Supply and also that of a number
of older men at GAF and the Com-
monwealth Aircraft Corporation is that
the finish of the Mirage-building pro-
gram late this year and the completion
of the Macchi trainer project in 1971-
72 represent only a lull in activity. In
the past, lay-offs have occurred be-
tween programs, as between the Can-
berra and the Mirage, without any
lasting damage to the industry.
The demand for aircraft is regarded
as necessarily periodic and therefore
the industry’s workload must vary.
Although the target aircraft Jindivik,
the anti-tank Malkara, and the Ikara
missile alone cannot support GAF
and the subsidiary contractors, projects
such as the small turbo-prop aircraft
currently under study will help to fill
the gap. The announcement that CAC’s
projected ground-attack trainer, CA-31,
would be used as part of a secret
Anglo-Australian defence scheme is also
cited as showing satisfactory prospects
for the industry.
An interim order of 12 Macchis
could also extend CAC’s time limit.
Mr. Gregg, his AAESD, and the AEU,
however, believe the industry is faced
with more than a temporary lull.
“There is no indication of any future
orders there is nothing positive at
all,” Gregg said. Their view is that
the Government is not considering how
difficult it is to bring men back into
The Mirage—just a lull in the building program?


the industry after such lay-offs. Men
had to be recruited from Britain before
the Mirage project could begin in 1961.
Mr. Gregg feared that both GAF
and CAC would be forced to survive
on non-aeronautical contracts in the
way that the Bendigo ordnance factory
has been obliged to use its skills and
precision equipment on non-defence
products.
There was a similarly depressing
future for civil aircraft. Of the three
light-aircraft firms operating two years
ago, only Transavia has survived. Victa
aircraft sold its manufacturing rights
to a New Zealand group which was
now exporting the same plane to Aus-
tralia, he said. Cropmaster also sold
out after the Tariff Board refused the
three companies a bounty on their air-
craft.
“In a country advanced enough to
build and constantly modify Jindivik,
the best craft of its kind in the world,
it is strange that we don’t care about
the dissipation of these skills,” Gregg
said.
Not, of course, that >the Government
disagrees with this broad demand. The
differences lie in the qualifications
placed upon it. Thus, a recently released
statement of policy said that the manu-
facture under licence of aircraft frames
and engines, together with the develop-
ment and production of local designs,
was possible in “selected areas suited
to the technological potential in Aus-
tralia.” New skills and techniques
would be added to those already estab-
lished “where it is economically
feasible.”
MEN AND MATTERS
TWO OF THE most successful mining
and oil traders in the market last year,
albeit professionals, were the invest-
ment companies managed by Kenneth
McMahon and Partners Pty. Ltd.
Mineral Securities multiplied profit
nearly ten times to $1,584,000, or at
144 percent on capital, while Petroleum
Securities earned $619,000 from incor-
poration in December, 1967, to June 30,
1968.
The public flotation of Pexa Oil
N.L. later this year, following allot-
ment of 3.6 million shares to Mineral
Securities and Petroleum Securities,
rounds out the McMahon family of
companies. Pexa will be the oil explora-
tion and development wing of Petrol-
eum Securities, as Amad is the mining
exploration and development wing of
Mineral Securities.
It was Ken McMahon’s 25 percent
for French in his first year at Scots
College which started him on the high
road to success, for the next year
geology was an alternative subject. He
got a pretty weird pass in the Leaving,
first-class honors in geology and three
Ken McMahon
J. Penfold Hyland
Bs. But it was 1944, he was 17 years
old, and he cleared out before the end
of the year and joined the Navy.
After the war he was articled to a
Sydney chartered accountant, 'but this
he did not like, so he went back to his
past love, doing a geology course.
In 1950, with his bride, he went to
Wittenoom Gorge, where the tempera-
tures were up to 118 degrees, and they
used empty dynamite boxes for chairs,
so everywhere was easy after that ex-
perience. The McMahons spent five
years in Canada and U.S.A., Ken
working in a British Columbia gold-
mine and in seven mines belonging to
American Smelting and Refining. When
their first child was born, they decided
it was time to come home and settle
down.
He managed a little mine up north
for a time, and then came under the
influence of the late Keith Cameron,
who was chairman of Mt. Morgan and
many other mining companies. When
Cameron was managing-director of
Commonwealth Mining Investments,
McMahon was 'his personal assistant,
but when Consolidated Goldfields
bought into CMI, there was no room
for McMahon.
This apparent disaster also proved
to be fortuitous. He then started on his
own the business which now embraces
engineering, exploration and mining,
and oil investment, employing thirty
graduates, mining engineers, metallur-
gists, geophysicists, and economists,
with average age of 32. (He is 41.)
McMahon does not believe in taking
work home, not even business reading.
In the office at around 7.30 a.m., he
works through until no later than
7 p.m., and he likes a long lunch. His
family, wife, and three children occupy
his weekends, apart from the odd game
of golf. Five novels a week consume
the small hours of the morning.
PENFOLDS IS IN expansive mood.
With the first vintages from the new
Dalwood Estate at Wybong Park in
the Upper Hunter Valley about to
make their debut on the market, the
large potential of this new vineyard
takes another step toward realisation.
And as if the rapidly expanding home
consumption of wine were not enough,
chairman Jeffrey Penfold Hyland has
launched himself on an extensive world
trip to boost export sales.
Mr. Hyland’s main mission is a five-
week assault on the State Liquor Boards
of Canada to get them to open up
their official lists to more of his com-
pany’s products. A week’s stopover
in New York should give some insight
into the company’s steadily expand-
ing market in the Eastern U.S. and a
visit to San Francisco could show up
considerable potential in the West, too.
With Wybong Park well under devel-
opment, there is plenty of scope for
handling future healthy expansions in
demand. Its 1100 acres increase the
company’s tdtal acreage by some 70
percent, and although, since its
aquisition in 1960, only 350 acres
have been planted, they alone are ex-
pected to produce more than 100,000
gallons from this year’s harvest. Already
in storage there are 60,000 gallons of
red and 100,000 gallons of white.
Penfolds has come a long way since
the first prophylactic brews were pro-
duced at Magill, South Australia, in
the mid-19th century by Dr. Rawson
Penfold for his anaemic patients. The
medicinal connections and the con-
sequent preoccupation with the forti-
fied wines stuck for many years. The
more recent change of image for the
company, the swing toward the table
wines which are the strength of its
business today, has been very much a
result of the increasing influence of the
doctor’s great-grandson, Mr. Penfold
Hyland, who, starting as a cellar boy
in 1928, proceeded to learn the family
business inside out before becoming
chairman last year of Australia’s largest
wine producer.
SAVINGS BANKS
HOUSING TROUBLES
THE SAVINGS BANKS’ interest rate
raised by 0.25 percent to 3.75 percent
ostensibly brings it into line with trad-
ing banks’ term deposit rates, increased
by a similar amount last month, and
could help to revive a failing growth
rate in deposits. In the three months
to the end of May this year the growth
in savings banks’ deposits was $40.8
million, compared with $78.3 million
for the same period last year.
Among the more virile competitors
for deposits are the building societies,
offering a much more attractive interest
rate of 6 percent. The current trend in
the pattern of home loans is an import-
ant one for the savings banks. Their
loans at an interest rate of between 5
and 5.75 percent—now to be reviewed,
“increases may follow of up to 0.5 per-
cent” have increased from $217 mil-
lion in 1963 to $364 million last year.
Those of the building societies, at an
interest rate around 7.25 percent, have
increased from $32 million to $ll5 mil-
lion over the same period and are
expected to reach $2OO million this
year.
The savings banks claim that the
building societies are encouraging a
high interest rate in housing, but bor-
rowers seem increasingly willing to


HAMMERSON
Mr. Sydney Mason on
another year of good progress
In his review of the year to 31st December, 1967, Mr. Sydney Mason, Chairman of
The Hammerson Property and Investment Trust Limited, makes the following points:
RESULTS: Against the general national background of economic depression and uncer-
tainty which existed in Britain throughout 1967 I am pleased to report that your
Company has continued to make good progress and the group profits before taxation
have increased from $1,488,269 in 1966 to $1,741,507 for the year under review.
Your directors recommend that the dividend for the year 1967 should be at the same
rates as for 1966, namely 20%.
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME: We have continued to press ahead with our development
programme. The highlights of 1967 from the Company's point of view were the com-
pletion and letting of three office blocks in Australia and the letting to Westminster
Bank Ltd. of Phase 1 of Woolgate House comprising approximately 150,000 sq. ft. of
office space in Basinghall Street in the City of London. These major lettings mark a
notable step forward and the rental income is now beginning to flow to discharge the
deferred interest which has accumulated in respect of these projects.
In Britain the construction of the various town centre schemes has continued and the
early phases of the Aylesbury. Burnley. Stockport and Walsall schemes are in opera-
tion and trading.
The improvement in the overall letting position has been sustained; forward "key"
lettings on the main schemes to multiple traders are very encouraging.
OVERSEAS: We have virtually completed the first phase of our operations in Australia
and New Zealand, which over a period of some eight years, has seen the creation of
a first class portfolio of shop and office developments which is now making a major
contribution to our annual revenue. We are now moving forward to the next phase
of our programme which will include not only the redevelopment of some of these
properties but also the enlargement of a number of our existing projects. In the
U.S.A. our developments are now taking shape and will be completed by the end of
1969. During 1967 we have taken a further step forward in the overseas field with
the formation of an association with a Dutch development company to undertake
joint developments on the European Continent and the first project, an office develop-
ment in Amsterdam, is now being formulated.
CURRENT SHARE PRICE: The Chairman in commenting on the current market price of
the Company’s shares said: I am sure that investors would not expect me to offer any
advice or comment on how far to look ahead or on what investment yields might
satisfy them in the meantime, but I am concerned to ensure that the current prices
and yields are not being accepted in the expectation of any rapid acceleration over
the next few years in the dividend rate which is likely to be recommended for pay-
ment on the Company’s shares.

GENERAL MANAGER FOR AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND
PETER F. BARRINGTON BLIGH HOUSE, BLIGH ST., SYDNEY
accept it in order to escape the some-
what unrealistic loan limit of $B5OO
imposed by the savings banks. The
policy of the building societies would
seem to be simply to gear a loan to the
capacity of the borrower to repay it,
and although at present their average
loan appears to be a little over $lO,OOO,
those of $15,000 and more to cover 90
percent of the cost of a house are not
unusual. What is more, the building
societies claim that their rapid increase
in business is not at the expense of the
savings banks at all but rather of the
high-cost second mortgage lenders who
have been thriving among the restric-
tive lending policies of the savings
banks.
Unlike the building societies, the
savings banks come under the direct
control of the Reserve Bank and with
them goes the control of by far the
largest source of home loans. Over
recent years, by increasing or decreas-
ing the rate of lending, the Reserve
Bank has been able to counteract to
some extent the ups and downs of the
building industry. The building
societies are, under present arrange-
ments, steadily undermining the effec-
tiveness of this source of control.
The process seems likely to acceler-
ate. To the monetary authorities the
most important function of the savings
Banks involves the 65 percent of their
funds that are compulsorily invested
in public securities. Should the build-
ing societies maintain their current
attractiveness for depositors to the
detriment of the funds flowing into
the savings banks, then it is obviously
the housing loan side of things and not
the public securities which is going to
feel the pinch. According to the general
manager of the Bank of N.S.W., there
is the possibility that the present 65
percent of assets put into public secur-
ities will be increased, which, coupled
with the prospect of the Commonwealth
possibly eliminating the 10 cents a
dollar rebate on income from Com-
monwealth securities which make up
more than a third of savings banks
assets throws the banks’ future profit-
ability into some confusion.
The building societies may not be
clipping all that much from the savings
banks’ home loans business, but they
are proving increasingly attractive as
far as depositors are concerned. They
claim, however, not to be interested
in the very small depositors which are
the traditional source of supply for
savings banks’ funds. That seems a
reasonable approach. The objective of
the savings banks should be, after all,
the supply of a reasonably profitable
medium for the humblest and least
knowledgeable of savers rather than
to supply the Reserve Bank with a lever
in the building industry or, come to
that, help the Treasury to raise money.
The current situation tends to suggest
that the medium is beginning to prove
not profitable enough, that knowledge
of the building societies or the stock
market is growing. In due course the
monetary authorities may have to re-
think the role of the savings banks.

TARIFFS
ACMA CHANGES COURSE
LAST WEEK we reported a modera-
tion in the Chamber of Manufactures
line on tariff policy at the talks 'w ith
Eederal Cabinet. They have called off
their demand for Government con-
demnation of the Tariff Board and
called off their attempts to stop it pub-
lishing its now much-publicised classi-
fication of industries.
We can now report the exact word-
ing of the Chamber’s private submis-
sion on the matter:
“Aspects of Australia’s long-standing
policy of support for Australian indus-
try which has underpinned our indus-
trial growth have been subject to a
mounting attack over the past year,
and we expect the attack to continue.
It is causing increasing disquiet among
management.
“The attack has already achieved
some success with the proposal of the
Tariff Board to publish in its next
annual report a classification of indus-
tries into ‘high,’ ‘medium,’ and ‘low’
protection categories and its intention
subsequently to contain investment in
high and medium protection areas.
“In the light of this environment,
concern is evident in manufacturing
industry as to the emphasis which the
Government will permit manufacturing
■to assume in the overall development
of the economy.
“We have an insufficient understand-
ing of our new Prime Minister’s ap-
proach to these questions and would
like to see him make a full statement
to Parliament at an appropriate time
on ‘aims of economic policy.’ In par-,
ticular, we would like to see him re-
affirm (a) the basic policy of support
for Australian history, and (b) the
Government’s belief in a high rate of
immigration.
“ACMA is naturally keen to partici-
pate in any discussions which may take
place within Government, and would
wish at the appropriate time to present
to Cabinet a paper containing our
views on the appropriate support
policies and mechanisms necessary for
the development of manufacturing
industry within the objectives of overall
national development.”
The Chambers of Commerce have
been intensifying their campaign of
support for the Tariff Board in direct
opposition to ACMA.
ACCA also announced a departure
in policy, saying that under the new
system it would support ACMA’s long-
standing claim for anticipatory tariffs:
“In the past, ACCA has been against
the use of anticipatory duties (duties
given in advance of production) on the
grounds that it would be difficult for
the Tariff Board to recommend precise
rates of duty in the absence of factual
costing data. However, in the context
in which the Board proposes their use,
anticipatory duties could be useful
stimulus >to efficient industries wishing
to expand their range of production.”

THE LAND
The primary matter of costs
THE MINISTER for Primary Indus-
try, Mr. J. D. Anthony, made the most
of the limelight last week. His opening
address to the Brisbane meeting of the
Australian Agricultural Council
traversed broadly the recent perfor-
mance and apparently glowing promise
in most sectors of rural industry. Then,
quickly down to Launceston and the
conference of the Tasmanian Farmers’
Federation, he laid very firmly on the
line what should be the attitude of “the
Australian people” toward this self-
same rural industry.
Mr. Anthony displayed no doubts
and did not hedge: “The Australian
people must realise it is right that they
should share some of the cost of
measures now taken, and which must
be taken in future, to help keep the
rural industries in a strong position
. . . They must be prepared to take a
little bit of bad with the good.”
The bad is quite easy to pinpoint. It
is “that the economic policies that
make life better for the majority of
Australians do tend to produce cost
pressures and other consequences to
make things harder for a minority
the people engaged in primary produc-
tion who cannot pass their higher costs
on, and who are tied to low-return in-
ternational markets.”
The crux, of course, comes at the
next stage of the argument. If the
majority benefits from those policies
which automatically carry the germ of
cost pressures, special measures have
to be enacted to help the minority.
And the majority has to be willing to
pay for them.
Now the community as a whole needs
little reminder of the contribution of
rural production to its economic health,
especially as far as the balance of pay-
ments is concerned. We can blow our-
selves up with a metals boom and
project the earnings from iron ore in
years ahead, yet the hard present fact
remains that primary industries win
some two-thirds of our export income
and will surely have to earn more in
the immediate future.
That tribute paid, the community is
thoroughly entitled to question and
criticise if any unnecessary or prevent-
ible cost elements are entering the rural
economy. Featherbedding is far from
the only charge to be raised. Farming
has to be seen to be an efficient indus-
try. Where exporting is concerned, out-
put must surely not be allowed to grow
too far above the possibilities of avail-
able overseas markets.
Mr. Anthony himself is now having
to wrestle with the new five-year wheat
stabilisation scheme. Wheatgrowers nat-
urally find it hard to admit that a bear-
ish world market constitutes a reason
for reducing Australian acreages and
cutting down subsidy payments. Yet,
overall public policy, and the costs situa-
tion, may demand such a program. It
can be of no general benefit, within
Australia, to offer an increase in the
domestic price of wheat.
Sugar, as we mentioned on this page
last week, is another great export-earner
whose cost structure and expansionism
rightly raises some public suspicion.
Many people must also be growing tired
at the innocuously slow attempts being
made to reform dairying.
It has to be understood that cost
problems, and special measures to allow
a “minority” to overcome them, are not
one-sided. One farming sector may be
given palliative assistance. Yet almost
inevitably another, more-efficient sector
will suffer as the new cost factor spreads.
What has been happening, internally, to
wool, admittedly a very efficient indus-
try, is a prime example of this.
The woolgrowers’ perpetual com-
plaints about rising costs should really
receive more attention. There is no
need to stress wool’s important export
position. But wool has 'been notable in
another respect. Until very recently,
there has never been any request for
Government subsidising of the industry.
In fact, the situation may be beyond
subsidy. With some pardonable exag-
geration, the president of the Austra-
lian Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Coun-
cil, Mr. T. B. C. Walker, asserts: “The
erosion of income of primary producers,
and woolgrowers especially, caused by
rising costs is so substantial that it is
beyond the capacity of the Government
to compensate them adequately.”
The corollary of that attitude is to
make every effort to stabilise costs and
this is precisely what Mr. Walker wants:
“The Federal Government can, how-
ever, follow economic policies designed
to maintain a high degree of price
stability. To the extent that it succeeds
in this, producers will have a greater
incentive and financial ability to raise
their productivity.”
Such a statement does not contradict
our earlier argument that some primary
industries certainly don’t require, under
immediate circumstances, a big increase
in either productivity or output. It
does, however, put an emphasis on cost
increases which harm not only rural
activities but the Australian economy
as a whole.
Drought and adverse overseas re-
turns meant that total net farm income
fell by 30 percent in 1967-68. As if
this wasn’t enough, prices paid by
farmers showed a rise of about 3 per-
cent for the year. That rise is probably
lower than cost increases over most
recent years. It is a direct burden
on what Mr. Anthony calls a minority.
Together with those “special measures”
designed to overcome such cost disad-
vantages, it is an examinable burden
on the community at large.

CATTLE: BOOK'S 117 BREEDS
VOLUME 2 OF “European Breeds of
Cattle,” a directory compiled by the
Food and Agriculture Organisation of
the United Nations, is now available.
It is being distributed by FAO’s sole
Australian agents, Hunter Publications,
23 McKillop Street, Melbourne, for
$2.50 a copy. This compendium can
widen the horizons of all cattle breeders
in this country. Because British breeders
were so successful during the 19th cen-
tury, we came to rely on them almost
exclusively and usually forget that
their famous breeds are derived from
European stock selected in relatively
recent times.
The British themselves, of course,
have always remembered this fact, and
turned to the Continent again for new
blood after the war, when the beef-
eaters of England altered their tastes
and the economics of beef production
changed. They imported the Charolais
to match the new circumstances and
started the current craze throughout
the English-speaking world for this mag-
nificent animal, which crosses so well
with the dairy breeds for the production
of dairybeef.
Australian acquaintance with Euro-
pean cattle is restricted to a few of the
northern breeds, such as Friesians,
Brown Swiss, Red Danish, Semmental,
and, recently, the Charolais. They
know little or nothing about the
southern and eastern breeds. These
cattle seem to be more closely related
to the original wild cattle of Europe,
Bos primigenius, or aurochs, which were
big - framed, strong - boned, beefy
animals. Many of the modern southern
and eastern cattle exhibit these traits
handsomely because the people of those
parts have traditionally esteemed cattle
for their meat and work rather than
for their milk, which the northerns
preferred.

European beef breeds is their pro-
pensity to lameness and various skeletal
breakdowns. Such crippling mishaps
occur because the bone structure of
these animals is not sufficiently massive
to support the weight of their muscles.
The danger is greatest in the early-
maturing, fast-growing types and is
aggravated by modern feeding tech-
niques, which encourage rapid fleshing
and a potentially disastrous imbalance
in the muscle/bone ratio. An infusion
of genes from the more robust southern
cattle could provide the easiest way out
of this dilemma.
Sharp-eyed Caesar on another of his
campaigns in transalpine Gaul
remarked on the occurrence of what we
now call double-muscled cattle. The
technical name for this strongly
inherent abnormality is muscular hyper-
trophy. The trait is classically described
as an excessive development of the
muscles with exceptionally low fat
content, comparatively light bones, and
thin skin. It is probable that Caesar’s
returning legions brought some of these
beasts back to Italy. At any rate,
double - muscling is common among
what is now known as the Piedmont
breed and especially in one particular
strain, the Alba. The excessive muscle
trait appears in the Charolais, which,
like the Piedmont (Alba) are also white
cattle. However, the French used the
Charolais as a draught animal and
through the centuries tried to get rid
of the trait because it is accompanied
by frail bones. The Italians were not
so concerned about this defect because
they regarded their Piedmonts as triple-
purpose cattle. Besides, their foundation
stock, being more directly derived from
the aurochs, were more heavily boned
than the Charolais.
Since tractors came to the foothills
of the mountains in the 1940 s the
Italians have actively selected for
double-muscling in these cattle and
more than half the population now
exhibit this character. Belatedly, the
French are trying to recover the lost
genes. In 1962 they scoured the
country for double-muscled Charolais
and established a small herd of them
at the National Agricultural Research
Institute near Paris, where Professor B.
Vissac is in charge of the breeding
program. The French name for these
unusual animals is Culard, and the
English and Americans are adopting it,
although they may well choose the
Italian Piedmonts to spread the gene
among their cattle.
Cattlemen overseas are now getting
very excited about double-muscling
and rightly so. Double-muscled carcasses
yield up to 20 percent more lean meat
than ordinary specimens of any given
breed. Our eye happened to fasten on
the Piedmont, but there are 117 other
breeds described in Volume 2 of
“European B'eeds of Cattle.” You’re
sure to find some other that will set
your mind to thinking about “the
glorious uncertainty of animal
breeding.”

Speculator’s Diary
ONE FOR RECOVERY,
ANOTHER BECAUSE IT
SEEMS UNDERPRICED
BERNIE BARUCH was an American
speculator who made millions. In his
autobiography, “My Own Story,” he
reveals some of the investment philo-
sophy which helped him to do it. Under
the circumstances his pointers are well
worth consideration:
1. Don’t speculate unless you can do
it full time.
2. Beware of “inside” information
and “tips.”
3. Before buying into a company find
out all you can about it.
4. Don’t try to buy at the bottom and
sell at the top —it can’t be done.
5. Take losses quickly and cleanly.
6. Have only a few investments,
they’re easier to watch.
7. Make periodic reappraisals of all
investments.
8. Never invest all your funds.
9. Don’t try to be a jack of all
investments—stick to what you know
best.
Like all good ideas, they are merely
plain and simple commonsense. How-
ever, you’ll be amazed just how much
self-discipline is necessary to carry them
out.
This week I’m continuing my policy
of buying recovery stock (or what I
hope will be recovery stock). My
buy this week is Jeffries Industries Ltd.
—the electrical and engineering group
of Artarmon, N.S.W. The company has
had a rough trot over the past few years
and its last two results have been nega-
tive ones. In 1965-66 the loss was
$139,000 and last year it was $282,000.
The 1966-67 loss was, however, due to
a large degree to heavy write-offs and
to non-recurring expenses. These items
sounded as though they were of a
“clean-up” nature and were paving the
way for the company to have a fresh
start and to begin a new era of profits.
And this seems to have happened. In
early June this year directors issued a
very encouraging interim report (the
company balances in November). It
said that the company’s earning
capacity had been restored and that
earnings for the six months to May 31
were in excess of $135,000. The report
then went on to say that considerable
progress had been made in revitalising
the company and that prospects for
the second half of the year were “fav-
orable.” Investment reaction was also
favorable. The price of the company’s
shares went from a year’s low of 29
cents to a high price of 59 cents. They
are now 58 cents. When the year’s
result is announced in December/
January next I suspect they’ll be even
higher. Following up my suspicion I
bought 400.
A company that I have admired for
quite some time, but for no other
reason than foolishness did not buy
into previously, is Kolotex Holdings.
The company is generally regarded as
one that is extremely aggressive and
very efficient. Judging by the fact that
its profits are highest of all the com-
panies in the hosiery business, the obser-
vation is obviously correct. In fact, if
earning rate on capital invested is any
criterion (and if that’s not, what is?)
the company is probably the most
profitable of all Australian public listed
companies.
Last year it returned almost 80 per-
cent on paid capital. Despite all this,
and the fact that the company has
already paid a three-for-ten bonus this
year, and had a considerable share-price
rise, its shares still look cheap. This is
especially so when the company’s price
earnings ratio of under ten is weighed
up against its earning rate and its past
history of earnings growth. And it’s not
as though this year’s achievements won’t
be up to scratch, either. In the first
six months of the year, ending in
December, the group increased its sales
from $2.4 million and hiked its profit
up by over 40 percent. The sales figures
are, however, not a proper guide be-
cause they include turnover from the
Camel group of companies, which were
not included in last year’s figures. The
profit increase is, nevertheless, a com-
parable one, as it is not expected that
the Camel group will make much of a
contribution to consolidated profits
until they are properly reorganised. It is
expected that this will not be until at
least late next year. Despite this, it
seems that Kolotex will do very well,
anyway. Directors have already an-
nounced that the rate of increase in
earnings will be maintained for the
remainder of the year, and my guess
is that it may even be exceeded. My
guess is also that demand for the com-
pany’s shares will similarly be main-
tained, and that it, too, will probably
be exceeded. Just to help demand along
(and myself to profits, I hope) I
bought 200.

It’s mostly in the mind
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
MARKETS are people. It is not
enough to be able to understand the
facts about mining news or discoveries
to do well in the market’s present mood;
you must also understand the way
other people are going to respond to
these facts. The point has often been
made here (and it was given added
strength in last week’s warnings from
three impressive sources) that there are
real dangers in the speculative end of
the mining boom; that there are many
companies with nothing else but high
Jiopes and a head office whose share
prices have already anticipated
bonanzas that will never come (and for
which little exploratory work is being
done, anyway). When the boom
psychology wears off, these stocks will
collapse and take a lot of small punters’
money with them.
On the other hand, there are many
companies that are spending really big
money on some excellent prospects and
do stand to discover something worth-
while. These discoveries may do little
more, in many cases, than simply justify
the high prices already been charged
for the shares, such as last week’s
example of the Exoil-Transoil uranium
discovery (which looks far more signi-
ficant, by the way, than the market has
so far given it credit) or Great Boulder-
North Kalgurli’s very significant nickel
discovery on a different prospect alto-
gether from its other two discoveries.
It is significant that in neither case did
these stocks rise on the news.
This seems realistic enough in a
market that is based as much on anti-
cipation as is this one. But the cor-
ollary of this that if it takes good
news to keep a stock up at its current
heights, then a lack of good news will
mean that it will fall.
Does this mean that the time has
come to get out of the mining market
or, as Corrie and Co. counsels “Do not
buy any stocks at this moment”? The
answer depends less on the facts of what
good news is coming up and more on
the market’s present psychology. Yet
the facts suggests the market should be
strong; the significant flow of major
news that has already marked the first
two weeks of the new financial year
should continue, not only from listed
mining companies but from the many
foreign-owned giants who together are
spending far more than Australian com-
panies on the minerals search. And
there is every prospect that the great
increase in oil-drilling activity will
result in some significant discoveries.
One handy guide to investors may be to
establish which companies are spend-
ing most on exploration and stick with
them. For luck is only part of this
business; success needs big spending.
But getting back to the market’s
psychology—the thing that really
matters. Last week’s sharply lower
mining turnover and steady prices gave
little indication that the bears had taken
over, but rather that there was an
absence of people prepared to buy at
these prices. Even the good stocks are
too high for most potential buyers, let
alone the roughies.
And most buyers in the market at
current prices are only doing so be-
cause they see a reasonable prospect of
showing a nice bit of capital gain on
their stocks in a short while; there are
probably relatively few really long-term
buyers among the Australians in the
mining market.
Now that there seems little likeli-
hood of the U.K. Government putting
added restraints on British investment
in Australia (this should be some sort
of quid pro quo for Australia agreeing
to stop the sterling disposals of the last
couple of years, in keeping with last
week’s Central Bankers “overdraft”
deal on sterling), the prospect is that
U.K. investment should continue at a
reasonable rate, even if it is a bit flower
than in the period up to now when a
fear of possible controls may have
stimulated an added rush of cash.
In brief, then, the prospect is that the
big news is going to be concentrated
among the companies spending big cash
on the mineral search; the market’s
psychology is changing from a “buy
anything for a rise” to a selective one.
This means that the leaders should be
able to stand up strongly in the face of
a general retreat by the less impressive
searchers when they fail to come up to
expectations. But, as was pointed out
last week, there is a long time to wait
before discoveries turn into cash. The
whole market could get a little tired of
waiting.
WHEN is Comalco Industries, the
booming bauxite-alumina-aluminium
arm of the mighty Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia, going to float publicly? Last
week’s news of the go-ahead of the Bluff
smelter on New Zealand’s South Island
surely brings closer the great day of
direct participation by Australian pri-
vate investors in the aluminium in-
The Chartist says:
HILL 50 GOLD MINES NL was first recommended as a technical buy at
29c in December, IS6B, and again in August, 1967, at 54c. A target of $1.50
was then indicated and this was exceeded in the sharp rise to $1.70 on extremely
high turnover approximately six weeks ago. The situation can now be reassessed
in terms of future probable trend development. Although the stock has since
reacted back toward the previous resistance level at $l.OO, which is a characteristic
of this type of technical pattern, there is promise of a future short-term rise to
approximately $2.50 and the overall base suggests a longer-term move close to
$4.40. The chart history shows that this is not a stock for the “faint” hearted
as it tends to have very steep vertical rises and reactions. However, it is at
present an interesting volume study and a return of buying power should send
prices ultimately to the targets indicated. Last sale price on 11/7/68 $1.24.

dustry. For the Bluff arrangements,
jointly with two Japanese aluminium
metal users, will mean a significant in-
crease in Comalco’s ability to use its
alumina entitlement from the rapidly
expanding Gladstone refinery. This,
rather than the added cream that Glad-
stone uses Comalco’s bauxite to make
this alumina, is the key to the situa-
tion.
For it is clear that Comalco’s Aus-
tralian primary metal activities (it
presently has capacity to produce
72,000 tons of aluminium a year) will
not be able to keep pace with the
growth in alumina capacity at Glad-
stone (which Comalco’s two parent
companies, CRA and Kaiser, own in
conjunction with Alcan and Pechiney).
Comalco’s present requirement of
alumina is 144,000 tons a year, but it
will soon have about 204,000 tons com-
ing available when the Gladstone re-
finery completes its expansion to
900,000 tons capacity. (This will give
Comalco 144,000 tons of alumina from
Gladstone and 60,000 tons from its
small refinery next to its Bell Bay
smelter in Tasmania.)
So it will have surplus capacity for
about 60,000 tons of alumina and
more to come, as plans are for an
eventual further doubling of Glad-
stone. This is where Bluff comes in.
Its initial capacity, when it starts late
in 1970, will be 70,000 tons of alumin-
ium, requiring 140,000 tons or so of
alumina, rising to 105,000 tons of alu-
minium (210,000 tons of alumina)
two years later. Add to this the
interesting situation in Sardinia,
where Comalco is taking a stake
in another alumina refinery (using
Weipa bauxite), and Comalco’s inter-
national strategy becomes even more
evident; it could no doubt “contra”
some of French-based Pechiney’s
alumina from Gladstone for use at
Bluff, if it needed it, in exchange for
Comalco alumina from Sardinia.
In any event, the vital need to en-
sure an outlet for Comalco’s alumina
entitlement is now being met by these
international moves at a time when
there could be a stagnant period for
its local aluminium metal business.
Competition in the Australian alumin-
ium metal market is soon to be in-
creased from one rival, Alcoa (which
by the way is rapidly expanding its cap-
acity, mainly for the export trade), to
two when Alcan opens its Kurri re-
finery next year. It may be some time
before the Australian market for alu-
minium metal increases by enough to
allow Comalco to add any more cap-
acity.
In addition to its role in Comalco’s
metal strategy, the Bluff plans also
raise the question of where Comalco
will get its half share of the $BO mil-
lion cost of the project. Already
Comalco’s capital of $3O million backs
borrowings of $7O million; it will need
more than Comalco’s rising cash flow
to meet the bill. This could suggest
that Comalco may well have a new
share issue to gear up its borrowing
capacity further. This in turn could
prompt parent company CRA to have
a new issue. And with the British Gov-
ernment’s restraints on capital exports,
it could mean that CRA’s 85 percent
owner, Riotinto Zinc Corporation, may
not be able to subscribe for its share.
In this instance, it could be useful for
CRA to sell its entitlement to the new
issue to Australian shareholders.
All right, so it is only conjectural.
But there seems no doubt that Comalco
will float sooner or later. Within the
next year, when Bluff’s capital costs
start being felt, could be a good time.
WHAT DOES ICI think of Dunlop
becoming such a dominent force in the
consumer end of the synthetic fibres
business? When the sls£ million bid
for Prestige Ltd. was first announced,
with the bidder remaining anonymous,
general market speculation was that
one of the big makers of synthetic
fibres was tying up a massive user of
his products apart from getting a
stake in a solidly improving company
with sound prospects. For after the
bid succeeds (and Prestige directors
have already given it the nod), Dunlop
will end up having an annual turnover
of about $6O million in the clothing
and footwear trade and will be easily
the country’s biggest user of Fibre-
makers’ synthetics (ICI) and Cour-
taulds’ rayon. No matter how unim-
portant the directors of Dunlop may
publicly regard this fact, it does put
this giant diversified rubber group,
which already had clothing and foot-
wear sales of $25 million a year, in a
very strong buying position against the
suppliers of fibre.
It naturally raises questions about
the continued independence of other
fibre consumers, particularly Brack
Mills and Universal Textiles, the old
STP-Tennyson group. Universal, whose
shares have been strongly recommended
here and have recovered from their
low of 58 cents earlier this year to
a peak of 86 cents, is in the interesting
position of having some of its major
suppliers already holding a proportion
of the company’s capital. This includes
the Japanese groups Teijin and Toyo,
from whom Universal large quan-
tities of imported greygoods for finish-
ing. These interests are large enough
for combinations of any three of the
big four (Carrington and Dewhurst 8
percent, James Nelson 8 percent, and
the two Japanese, who together hold
11|- percent) .to block a complete take-
over by any of the others.
Nevertheless, Universal still appeals
for further recovery, as retail sales
figures have been strengthening in
recent months and the company seems
to have overcome most of the amalga-
mation problems that beset it in 1966-
67, when it had a dull year. Its pre-
merger share price had been the
equivalent of better than $1 .two years
ago. That seems a sensible target.

Mining
JUNO'S BISMUTH IS
SOMETHING FOR
INVESTORS' STOMACHS
THERE SEEMS little doubt that
Peko-Wallsend will live up to all the
estimates which have been made over
the past year of its earnings potential
for the year just past. Most of the
expected increase has come from the
Juno mine’s contribution to overall
gold output, but the company’s pro-
duction results for the year just past
also show increases in production of
copper, coal, and tin and, of course, the
Juno mine also contributed 93 tons of
bismuth for the first time. This in
itself is worth a cool $1 million.
The Juno mine was in production for
only 36 weeks of the year and this
should be kept in mind when assessing
the outlook for next year, when it will
produce about half as much again. But
last year the effect it had on the
company’s production is still dramatic;
while ore treated rose 8 percent (from
270,039 tons to 294,519 tons), gold
output jumped from 33,238 ounces to
89,052 ounces. In terms of actual cash
the effect of this rise would have
increased revenue by $1.7 million, while
costs would have increased by perhaps
only $150,000 to $200,000 on account
of the ore treated from Juno, and the
bismuth content of the same ore added
another $1 million.
Peko sells its concentrates under con-
tract to the Sumitomo group of Japan.
This contract provides that the copper
content of the concentrates shall be
paid for at the average E & M J New
York export refinery price for the month
of shipment. The price the company
receives for the gold content of the
concentrates has not been made avail-
able, but has in the past been close to
the $U.5.35 per ounce which is in force
on official markets. The E & M J
(Engineering and Mining Journal)
price is a conglomerate figure compris-
ing roughly a weighted average of the
prices for copper obtained from several
sources. It had a lot more relevance a
few years ago when there were large
differences in price between copper
bought on the London Metal Exchange
and copper bought from producers in
Zambia or Chile. Now that these large
differentials have disappeared the E &
M J price would follow the London
Metal Exchange quotations fairly
closely. For the 12 months to June 30
copper prices on the LME have on
average been fractionally lower, but the
small increase in Peko’s production
from 7596 tons to 7786 tons almost
compensated for these lower prices.
Bringing together the differences in
revenue the following estimates can be
made: sales of gold would have risen
by some $1.7 million; bismuth output
added perhaps $1 million; higher tin
production another $36,000; and higher
coal production a further $200,000-
$300,000, while there was probably a
small contribution from silver, produc-
tion of which is associated with copper
from the Peko mine. Overall, these
increases add up to some $3 million,
while the added costs involved would
have been minimal, arising mainly from
the expense of extracting and treating
the 14,455 tons of ore from the Juno
mine, and the mining of an additional
35,000 tons of coal—perhaps $300,000
from both of these.
This leaves a net addition of $2.7
million to be added to last year’s profit
of $l.B million for the Peko group of
mines. This year, however, group
profits will, for the first time, include
the earnings of Mt. Morgan Limited,
which was acquired late last year. At
M't. Morgan, things have not been
nearly so encouraging. After its prob-
lems with drought, which restricted pro-
duction due to lack of sufficient water,
Mt. Morgan last year made a good
recovery, but the year just past has
seen a fall in the grade of ore treated
as well as an increase in the ratio of
overburden to ore removed, and the
amount of ore milled was stepped up
in an attempt to offset lower grades.
The reduction in grades meant that
the gold content of Mt. Morgan’s
smelter output fell by 34,250 ounces,
worth $1 million, while copper pro-
duction fell by 700 tons. Combined with
slightly lower copper prices, this drop
in copper output would have meant
a fall in revenue of some $900,000. On
top of this, the company mined and
milled some 500,000 tons of overburden
at a cost of perhaps 50 cents per ton.
The company charges a certain propor-
tion of overburden removal costs to
an account provided for in previous
years, and hence the full effect of this
increase will probably not be felt, but
the amount involved would certainly
have offset any reduction in smelter
costs from reduced smelter output.
The combined effects of the fall in
revenue from gold and copper will
have had a substantial effect on Mt.
Morgan’s profit. Last year, this was at
the record level of $2.7 million and,
for the 12 months just ended, a sizable
drop is expected, although perhaps this
will not be as bad as the figures above,
which would indicate a profit of only
$BOO,OOO. Even if it were as large as
this, overall profit of the new Peko
group would then come to $3.7 million,
equivalent to 34 cents per Peko share.
On this basis the market is obviously
pricing Peko shares on expectations for
1969 earnings, which will include a full
12 months of production from the Juno
mines, adding well over $1 million
to total profit.
TAX INCENTIVES, as New Zealand
has realised, are the key to the attrac-
tion of large-scale overseas investments.

Bluff will no doubt prove an attractive
one for overseas investment potential.
For a period of 15 years Comalco will
pay 50 percent and the Japanese asso-
ciates 52.5 percent, made up from their
own “home rate” plus 7.5 percent. For
a further ten years the rate of tax
applicable to New Zealand resident
companies may apply.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Overseas Trade, J. R. Marshall,
announced that legislation will be intro-
duced this session enabling “projects
meeting certain criteria and established
for the processing of a mineral to the
primary metal stage to be declared
eligible for specified tax concessions.”
The criteria have yet to be drawn up,
but they will be wide enough to include
the concessions which attracted the Jap-
anese companies associated with the
financing of the Comalco project.
Mr. Marshall pointed out that with-
out changing the rates of taxation for
overseas companies operating in New
Zealand it would have been more profit-
able for the Japanese companies to
establish a smelter in Japan.
Announcing the smelter concessions,
Mr. Marshall said the companies had
agreed to pay 10 percent more for the
power. Cheapness of New Zealand
electricity was the great attraction of
the Bluff site, but some New Zealanders
are predicting a little remorsefully that
in return for this massive export of
electric power the New Zealand house-
holder will eventually have to pay more
himself.
Net exchange earnings from the Bluff
smelter should quickly reach $lO
million, rising to $25 million as the
second stage —expanding the smelters’
capacity to 210,000 tons —becomes
established. Taxation received should
soon reach $5 million.
Apart from the $45 million to be
spent in New Zealand during a rela-
tively short period of construction, some
700 people will be employed at the
completion of the first stage, with
employment of 1800 finally envisaged.
New Zealand has over 8000 unem-
ployed at present. Reports indicate
there will be recruitment in Australia
for some of the more skilled staff, but
the employment prospects, inflow of
new skills, and ancillary industries make
the Bluff smelter a very attractive pro-
position for the Southland province of
the South Island, which has been miss-
ing out economically to the North
Island.
But for some the present plans and
arrangements are not all that they
should be. Although the Labor Opposi-
tion helped get the initial Comalco
negotiations off the ground, they are
voicing some regrets that the Bluff
project bears little relationship to clear
development plans. A feeling is still
kicking around that all that cheap
power should have been used for
domestic industry. And rather than
echoing Mr. Marshall’s emphasis on a
competitive situation for shipping the
ore trans-Tasman, ideas of supporting
a national shipping line are under dis-
cussion.

GOOD PROGRESS IN
BRITISH TOBACCO'S
EXPENSIVE RECOVERY
THE LAST decade has been a period
of great test for British Tobacco. Its
virtual monopoly control over the Aus-
tralian tobacco market was first
hemmed back, then overwhelmed by
Rothmans’ and Philip Morris’ attack
on the citadel. The cancer scare not-
withstanding, British Tobacco’s counter
attack in bringing out a. multiplicity of
brands at both the low- and high-price
range of the cigarette market proved a
masterly stroke and has led to a sub-
stantial profit recovery. Since the net
income high of $5.49 million in 1959,
it took British Tobacco six years of
hard slogging to earn sufficient profits
to pass this profit bench mark, but since
1965’s peak of $6.72 million, there has
been a further gain of 30 percent in net
income, and this is very substantial by
any financial standard.
At the same time, the industry ups
and downs have been at the expense of
cancelling any real growth in the com-
pany’s share-market value over the past
decade, and this also holds true for
growth in dividends. Over the ten
years 1957 to 1967, British Tobacco
was only able to show a stock-market
appreciation of 56 percent and a divi-
dend growth of 41 percent (after
adjusting for new issues), which is not
a very exciting performance for one of
Australia’s Top 50 Leader stocks.
In addition to staging a comeback
in cigarettes and tobacco, British
Tobacco’s major move came in 1963
and 1964 with the formation of two
holding companies to look after its
interests in the diversified areas of
packaging and food. First came Leigh-
Mardon Pty. Ltd. in 1963, in which the
company took a 60 percent controlling
interest, with its English associate
Mardon International taking the
balancing 40 percent. Then in 1964
Associated Products and Distribution
Pty. Ltd. was formed, with BT (A)
holding a 51.8 percent majority interest
and British American Tobacco London
the minority 48.2 percent interest.
This exercise was to become the base
for a massive series of over 30 take-
overs in which British Tobacco did not
use its Qwn share capital to acquire
companies, but paid cash supplied by
its partners and itself. Its British part-
ners were ready made. British Ameri-
can Tobacco (BAT) has long been the
company’s rich uncle and holds a 32.7
percent interest in the Australian com-
pany’s ordinary shares (BAT also holds
an interest in BT(A’s) preference
capital and in the “B” ordinary shares).
Mardon International, which BAT and
Imperial Tobacco Co. of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland (the British W.
D. & H. O. Wills) jointly own is also
a cosy partnership; Imperial Tobacco
was not only one of the two original
parents of BAT, but still holds a
paternal 25.8 percent interest in its
former offspring.
In 1967 British Tobacco had, accord-
ing to my calculations, about 49 per-
cent of its net funds employed in the
W. D. & H. O. Wills tobacco side of
the business, about 28 percent in Associ-
ated Products & Distribution (soft
drink, ice-cream, snack foods, frozen
foods, poultry processing and other
meat, pastoral properties), about 21
percent in Leigh-Mardon, now incor-
porating Fibre Containers Ltd.
(packaging and printing), and the
balance in other interests including TV
film processing, baking and packaging,
and machinery manufacturing,
British Tobacco seems to have gone
much further in diversification moves
outside its traditional field than any of
the large tobacco companies in either
U.S.A. or Britain. For example, in the
U.S.A., American Tobacco reports
that approximately 20 percent of sales

are outside the tobacco industry; in
Philip Morris’ case the figure is about
15 percent and about 25 percent for
Liggett & Myers. Neither R. J. Rey-
nolds nor P. Lorillard quote the propor-
tion of their non-tobacco interests,
but they would not be any greater
than for the other U.S. majors. In
Britain, the non-tobacco interests as a
proportion of sales are about 8 percent
for Imperial Tobacco (although this
includes the operation of ancillary
tobacco interests such as retail tobac-
conists, and hairdressing salons) and
about 12 percent for British American
Tobacco.
British Tobacco has a number of
marketing advantages up its sleeve. For
example:
It is No. 1 in Australia in cigarettes,
ready - rubbed tobacco, cigars (with
about 39 percent of the nation’s cigar-
ette sales); No. 1 in tobacco whole-
saling and cigarette vending machines;
No. 1 in fibreboard paper products
(controlling, say 16 percent of Aus-
tralia’s output); possibly No. 1 in ice-
cream sales, with about one-third of
the market in the three eastern States
and in the West; possibly No. 1 also in
potato crisps if “Sun Valley” is added
to the 48 percent owned affiliate
“Smiths Potato Crisps.”
It also is No. 2 in soft drinks, with
about 15-18 percent of the Australian
market in the three eastern States and
in Western Australia; is the dominant
producer of poultry meat in the West,
and through a 40 percent-owned affiliate
in Victoria; has a substantial stake in
frozen foods; and with its pastoral
properties extending over 400,000 acres,
it also has a major interest in primary
production.
So far the expensive amounts spent
on diversification by British Tobacco
has not paid off. For example, take the
approximate breakdown of group pre-
tax profits in 1966 and 1967.

There are also a number of prob-
lem areas to be overcome; perhaps
the most critical being the often-
rumored lack of highly competent top
management personnel to make the
conglomerate food group a more effec-
tive and more profitable enterprise.
There is also a jumble of conflicting
distribution systems which have to be
harnessed together.

potential has not even been nearly fully
developed and long-term investors
should look on this stock with interest.

THE WRONG TIME FOR
TAKING OVER
ANDERSON MEAT
THERE IS nothing new about the
market being better informed of the
likelihood of a takeover than the direc-
tors of the company in question; there
are even some investors who make it a
rule to buy on denials. But does the
market know more than the directors
of Anderson Meat Industries who last
week said they were unaware of any
prospective developments to warrant
recent share price rises? The chance is
that it does—but it is strictly a chance
that only “punters” should play.
There have been plenty of rumors of
takeover talk in recent weeks. British
Tobacco, with its Playfair meat busi-
ness coming good after a difficult
period, has been nominated as a strong
possibility, as has Australian Bacon,
which is already doing very nicely
indeed out of its acquisition of the
smallgoods division of Anderson’s a little
more than a year ago. Apart from the
clearly stated assets of Anderson’s Meai.
likely to have a book value of 38 cent'
per ordinary share by now and which
may be attractive to any rival meat
.company that does not have too mam
troubles of its own to handle, there ate
also the tax losses that could well have
risen to almost 50 cents per ordinarv
share by the end of June. So, even if
the realisable values of the assets are less
than book values (and it lost $30,000
when it sold its Byron Bay meatworks).
there are clear attractions in the stock
as a takeover proposition or for further
dismemberment.
But one fact should not be overlooked;
the market of potential buyers for
Anderson’s (or parts of the company) is
not in a healthy state right now. Most
meat companies are still suffering the
after-effects of the drought that, mixed
with some bad management, all but
destroyed Anderson’s. If Anderson’s
could muddle through for a while until
rival meat companies were in a more
aggressive mood, then the prospects of
a good bid would be much greater. As
things stand, there are few buyers for
meatworks; no one responded when
Anderson’s put its Roma works on the
market.
So the longer it waits the greater
chance of doing moderately well in a
sale. But can it wait? Last week
directors amended their forecast of last
September that the company would
earn a modest trading profit in 1967-68
along with their subsequent hope in
their interim report that operations
would be profitable in the June quarter
following a $70,000 loss in the first half
of the year. Instead, they now expect
an operating loss of $275,000 for the
year, which is likely to be increased by
non-operating items, so that actual net
loss for the year could be even larger.
This may not have destroyed the
company’s ability to sit things out —nor
its appeal to a prospective bidder. As
is inevitable after a drought, good
seasonal conditions in southern Queens-
land and northern New South Wales
have limited the availability of cattle,
as farmers concentrate on rebuilding
their herds. These cattle have to come
forward sooner or later, and with luck
they may all start to be available at
about the same time, so pushing down
their prices with a bump that could
nudge several unhappy-looking meat
.companies back into the black.
So there is some incentive for a pros-
pective bidder for Anderson’s to act
fairly soon; even in its present stunted
state, the company appears to have the
ability to make at least small profits
once conditions in the industry go its
way, which may increase the price of
acquisition, and the improved condi-
tions would also increase the acquisi-
tive power of others.
There are some who would question
Anderson’s ability to survive even in
good times. But the disasters of last
Eastern States meatworks
year appear to have had specific causes
not only in the drought but also in
some management mistakes that are
being righted at considerable expense.
Every main function from the general
manager down has been the subject of
executive change and its financial
advisers have brought about operational
changes. For instance, last year’s tem-
porary reopening of the Roma meat-
works was a costly error of judgment;
continual delays in the completion of
the Shepparton meatworks created
substantial losses as the company had
set up operation in Melbourne expect-
ing supplies of meat from Shepparton,
which did not come. The company has
now withdrawn from the contract and
from Victoria altogether and is advised
that it is entitled to recover its losses
and damages.
In any event, there is nothing new
about Anderson’s being available for
takeover. Anderson’s receiver has been
negotiating with different parties since
he took office; the market’s hope is
that current negotiations are more
significant than before.
This has been reinforced not only
by the solid rise in the stock, and its
healthy recovery after a downturn on
the directors’ latest loss announcement,
but also 'by the heavy turnovers in-
volved. Having risen to 33 cents, they
fell to 28 cents before recovering to
their current -price of 27 cents (which
represents a good recovery from the
nadir of 18c).
One possibility that Anderson could
be a takeover prospect was perhaps
nurtured by Australian Bacon’s good
result last week, boosted by the small-
goods subsidiary, Anderson’s Processed
Foods, which it bought in June, 1967.
Australian Bacon, with its Dandy
brand, strengthened earning rate from
23.8 to 26.3 percent, but dividend was
pinned at 8 percent, so what was it
planning to do with its large cash
ilow? Anderson could provide Aus-
tralian Bacon with product diversifi-
cation from pigmeat, and geographic-
ally from Victoria to New South Wales
and Queensland.
Anderson’s net asset backing at 1967
reckoning was approximately par, 50c
a share, and this could be whittled away
to about 38c by further losses in the
year just ended. An accommodation
with Anderson’s creditors and an offer
of up to 36 cents for the 2,755,968 50c
ordinary shares (there are also 150,000
.$2 -preference shares) would probably
find ready acceptance.
Anderson still has meatworks at Wal-
langarra on the Queensland-New South
Wales border, which it obviously con-
siders the most valuable of its original
three.
The meatworks situated in the
northern N.S.W. dairying district of
Byron Bay, which primarily provided
American markets with manufactured
meat from old boners, was sold to
F. J. Walker at the beginning of Febru-
ary last for $650,000 cash.
Another effort to keep Anderson
afloat was to put the Roma meatworks
on the market in June last year as “at
present surplus 'to production require-
ments.” They were advertised as having
a rated slaughtering capacity of 2000
beef cattle a week. Peak production of
65,000 -cattle was achieved in 1964-65,
and between 1965 and 1967 -the com-
pany had made $300,000 capital in-
vestment to raise them to export
standard.

Bacon for Anderson Processed Foods
was $919,000, but only $538,000 was
paid over before Anderson’s 1967
balancing. The bulk of this was used
to reduce bank overdraft, which fell
from $3.6 million to $1.5 million, not
counting the long-term unsecured bank
loans of $282,000. Pre-receivership
creditors were shown separately in 1967
accounts as $1.9 million.
Over the year to July 1, 1967, stocks
had been reduced (by $1 million to $1.6
million, and debtors by SBOO,OOO to $1.6
million. Some of this would have been
explained by the sale of the smallgoods
subsidiary, which had accounted for
about 15 percent of Anderson’s turn-
over.
It is general with any meat company
that the stocks are pre-sold. Part of the
fall in stocks could be accounted for by
a falling away in forward contracts. It
is understood that debtors and stocks
were somewhat lower at 1968 balance
date than the year before.
In the past year liquidity has been
improved by almost SIJ million, by
the following realisations:
• $381,000 as final payment from Aus-
tralian Bacon for Anderson’s Processed
Foods;
• $150,000 from the sale and lease-
back of the Sydney administrative
headquarters, Anderson House;
• $700,000 for the sale of the Byron
Bay meatworks and reduction in stocks
as a result.
There were secured creditors for
$115,000, and allowing for these the
company still has to find some $2.3
million to square with the bankers and
pre-receivership creditors.
One reason for ithe company’s
present strength is that the shares have
a good “buy” pattern on the charts.
But before discounting this as un-
related to its fundamental position, it
must be realised that the pattern only
began in the first place because of some
very strong buying pressure that pushed
the shares up on increasing turnover.
But on its very real takeover prospects
it is hard to see much over 35 to 40
cents as a likely price, even though
the company seems to be worth more
than par on a going-concern basis. And
on its recovery prospects, prices up to
25 cents seem reasonable if seasonal
conditions are kind.

THE MARX BROTHERS
WITH OVERTONES
OF lAN FLEMING
By JOHN BAXTER
Philby: The Spy Who Betrayed a
Generation. Bruce Page, David
Leitch, Philip Knightley. Andre
Deutsch. $3.85.
“I HAVE NO such affection for
Philby and no admiration. We shall
never, I hope, create a society that is
proof against his kind; the little man
who found a big name for cheating.
Philby is the price we pay for being
moderately free; for being able to read
this book . .
So spy writer John le Carre sums
up the significance of the Philby case
in a lengthy and solemn introduction
to this, the most credible and informa-
tive of the many books on the subject.
It is a judgment typical of the book,
a “more in sorrow than anger” denun-
ciation of a man who, as the subtitle
rather loftily terms it, “betrayed a
generation.”
Which generation this refers to is not
clear. Ostensibly the writers are
alluding to the affluent pre-war
graduate society from which Philby
came and by which he was so efficiently
protected throughout his long career as
a double agent for the Western and
Soviet secret services. The phrase
might just as well, however, apply to
the authors’ contemporaries, markedly
different in mood and ideals from
Philby’s. All three writers are in their
thirties, and issue from the deter-
minedly “aware” purlieus of “The Sun-
day Times.” Two of them are Aus-
tralian-born. Predictably the attitude
they take to Philby and the Burgess/
Maclean scandal in general is one of
moral indignation and malicious
mockery, while every line implies that
this anger should be shared by those of
us young enough to be absolved of
blame for such stupidity.
Perhaps happily, perhaps not, it is
hard for one to remain at a high peak
of irritation over Philby, so enthusi-
astically do the writers throw them-
selves into the task of unmasking the
incredible thickheadedness of the so-
called “secret world” of Western intel-
ligence. It is a long time since I have
read a non-fiction book so full of a
novel’s excitement and comedy. The
whole thing is as splendidly nutty as
a Marx Brothers movie, with overtones
of lan Fleming’s more outrageous
fantasies.
The “hero” is, if anything, more
unreal than any fictional spy; H. A. R.
“Kim” Philby, a disaffected patrician
named for Kipling’s hero by his
Arabist father, who, through his
activities as a kind of cut-rate Lawrence
of Arabia, permanently ingrained in his
son a need to feel influential in matters
of international moment. The writers
see Philby’s complex background as
having a substantial effect on his final
activities, influencing him to turn the
passionately idealistic socialism of his
Cambridge student days into a career of
spying for the Russians, but the evi-
dence to suggest this is slim. Like many
of the judgments in the book, it seems
designed more to support the thesis
that class caused it all than to make
valid points about motivation.
As the story unfolds, Guy Burgess
and Donald Maclean emerge as
decidedly less important characters in
the drama. Burgess, a snobbish volup-
tuary, homosexual and gross, hung
around the Foreign Office, picking up
odd items of information but debarred
for ever from the upper echelons by
his sexual proclivities and general in-
eptitude. Maclean, by contrast, moved
freely in state circles, a young godling
of the diplomatic aristocracy, heir to
every secret. Despite chronic mental
and nervous debility and a substantial
drinking problem, he occupied positions
of trust as a high officer of the British
diplomatic posts in Paris, Cairo, and
Washington, using the last as a base to
feed a stream of information to Russia
on the American atomic effort and the
complex wrangles between Britain and
the United States.
That he could do this without detec-
tion for so long has generally been
attributed to Philby, the key man, who,
as an important executive of the British
security service, was in a position to
protect his confederates and allay
official suspicion, but the writers of
this book made it quite clear that
Philby had only the most general role
to play in Maclean’s espionage. What
protected all three men was not a
complex web of deception but the
stupidity and conceit of those around
them. “The combination of privileged
amateurism at the top with parsi-
monious makeshift below was common
enough in British Government service
when World War II began,” the book
observes, then theorises, “It derived
from essential deficiencies in English
society . . .” Class again.
As a catalogue of critical footnotes
on the British Government and Intelli-
gence Service, this book is surely
unique, recording some of the most
damaging anecdotes about the “secret
world” ever committed to paper.
Especially hilarious is the section on
MIS and its legendary record system
in which, it was popularly supposed,
was listed every subversive person in
the Empire. The whole was housed
during the war in Wormwood Scrubs
prison, from which the prisoners
providentially had been removed. The
authorities had, however, omitted to
take with them the prison padre, a
venerable divine who absentmindedly
hectored his new charges every day on
the necessity to go straight after they
were released. An operative of the time
Philby in Moscow...little man
who found a big name
recalled reminiscently, “I never missed
a service.”
On investigation the fabulous MIS
records proved to be of suspect worth.
Listed as subversive agents were a
number of the investigators’ associates,
including his mother, and a lady in a
coastal town whose sole claims to in-
clusion were the facts that she
frequently stood gazing out to sea and
“had a German friend.” Other in-
clusions, gleaned from some generously
donated party guest list, were Mes-
dames Muriel Bigtitz and Nora Borl-
zoff. The incompetence of the ex-Indian
Police officers which made up the bulk
of Mls’s operatives may at best be
guessed at, but on the evidence of this
book their profound humorlessness and
lack of imagination is abundantly
apparent.
As history, “Philby: The Spy Who
Betrayed a Generation” is probably
limited in worth. The events of 1951
are still too close for any detached
assessment to be made, while the cir-
cumstances leading up to Philby’s defec-
tion in 1963 are even more untouchably
explosive. Huge gaps necessarily exist
in the writers’ information, and while
it is, perhaps, essential that these be
filled in with speculation, their imagin-
ations have often been alarmingly
active. Much is made of Philby’s father-
less childhood and the significance it
may have had in his eventual duplicity,
but the evidence is flimsy. As le Carre
chillingly points out in his introduction,
no evidence has been discovered as to
the identity of the man who recruited
Philby, Burgess, and Maclean during
their undergraduate days, a man who
may still be active in the highest levels

of British society. Until his identity is
known, speculation about motives seems
idle.
The constant reference to Philby’s
social affiliations and the advantages ol
birth which earned him special consid-
eration from his superiors also seem
contrived and imposed on the facts.
Philby is drawn as an archetypal Eng-
lishmen, well bred, snobbish, “an all-
round good chap,” yet his heavy drink-
ing, ruined marriages, and unconven-
tional behaviour must surely have
placed him outside the accepted pat-
tern of British social life. Little evi-
dence is brought forward to suggest
that such was Philby’s image, most of
the assertion resting on the fact thar
he still takes “The Times” in Moscow
to keep up with the cricket scores. This
is mentioned frequently, most ludic-
rously in the first chapter, where, des-
cribing Philby today, the authors note,
“If it happens to be the cricket season,
he may pause (in front of the Russian
secret-service offices) to turn to the
sports page and check up on county
or Test cricket results . . .” Somehow,
I doubt it.
The real truth behind Philby’s fan-
tastic success as an agent seems to have
been not protective coloration and the
herd instinct of the British upper
classes but his own undoubted ability.
Despite all the efforts to make him a
symbol of Kiplingesquc Victorianism
and a corrupt society, Philby emerges
from this book as an engaging, highly
professional careerist. Unlike Burgess
and Maclean, he has never lost his sang-
froid, seldom betrayed himself, and
never his real masters. Having brought
to nothing a substantial portion of the
British and American Intelligence effort
for five years, he argued and bluffed his
way out of exposure, then, when his
cover was finally blown, slipped over
the border to Russia and freedom. I
don’t think that even Harry Palmer
would be ashamed of a coup like that
SHOULD THEY HANG?
By PETER SAMUEL
The Penalty Is Death. Edited by Barry
Jones. Sun Books. $1.75.
MR. JONES AND his colleagues in the
Victorian Anti-Hanging Council have
bent over backwards in this attempt
at impartiality. It is extremely difficult
to get believers in the retention of thf
death penalty to argue their case and
put it in writing. But in this book, to-
gether with a collection of arguments
for abolition, are several articles by
retentionists.
Two are by policemen. The more
significant, J. Edgar Hoover’s, is one
of those declamatory sermon-like state-
ments which flits from one issue to
the next, the grand ringing phrases un-
interrupted by any attempt to develop
a logical sequence. The thing amounts
merely to three assertions: first that the
death penalty is necessary to provide
the murderer with a punishment “com-
mensurate with his deeds.” It is addit-
ionally “an instrument with which (the
State) may guard the righteous against
the predators among men.” But Mr.
Hoover finds emotion the most persua-
sive argument: “Words and words and
words may be written, but no plea in
favor of the death penalty can be more
horribly eloquent than the sight of the
battered, sexually assaulted body of this
child.”
Most bizarre is the article by a local
Vietnik-hanger, who says that as a re-
sult of a “frantic obsession with Com-
munism” we conscript youth to be sent
abroad to fight men who “have neither
harmed us nor threatened to do so,”
blinding us to a “vastly graver and more
immediate menace to Australia grow-
ing up right here within our shores”:
rampant crime arising from leniency
in the courts. The criminal is “a beast
in human form,” who cannot be toler-
ated. And so on. Perhaps we could
establish abattoirs for these criminals
out in the scrub.
Perhaps the most interesting argu-
ment is the oldest one, a passage in a
book by Joseph de Maistre, a member
of the Napoleonic establishment. One
particular proposition is put which, the
rhetoric and exaggeration aside, prob-
ably remains the most important argu-
ment in the minds of retentionists to-
day: “All grandeur, all power, all sub-
ordination rests on the executioner: he
is the horror and the bond of human
association. Remove this incomprehen-
sible agent from the world, and at that
very moment order gives way to chaos,
thrones topple, and society disappears
. . . Evil exists on the earth and acts
constantly and, by a necessary conse-
quence, it must be continually repressed
by punishment . . . The sword of justice
has no scabbard; it must always
threaten or strike.”
Now there are undoubtedly pro-
hangers who are less psychotically cata-
clysmic in their approach to the sub-
ject of murder and its punishment, but
it is impossible to get them to express
themselves publicly. The only explan-
ation would seem to be that they feel
intuitively the need for the gallows as
a symbol of the power of the State.
None of the conventional arguments
wash. The eye-for-an-eye argument
that killers should be killed must if
seriously held be matched by arguments
that bashers be bashed, robbers robbed,
and so on. Murder is obviously an
extraordinarily bad crime and the prin-
ciple of retribution dictates that it be
matched by an extraordinarily severe
punishment as a mark of social disap-
proval. But there is no particular
reason why that punishment should in-
volve the application of the death
penalty.
The deterrence argument in favor of
the death penalty does not stand up,
either. Everyday experience provides
ample evidence of the failure of the
possibility of a death penalty to deter.
People continue to smoke, grow fat,
and drive motor-cars despite the huge
number of executions which cancer,
heart disease, and traffic accidents in-
flict. Every empirical survey of murder
rates and the application of capital
punishment fails to discover the in-
verse correlation which the theory of
deterrence demands.
The main effect of the application of
the death penalty in modern societies
appears paradoxically to be to reduce
the average level of punishment meted
out to murderers. With gallows being
used, juries show a markedly greater
reluctance to find accused murderers
guilty, and acquittals become more
common.
Despite their eye - for -an - eye
arguments, very few hangers urge the
hanging of all murderers, as their logic
requires. Few even urge more frequent
hangings, and most appear quite satis-
fied by the occasional hanging every
other year or so. Which reinforces
the feeling that the clue to their
motivation is symbolism. They want
the gallows to be maintained as a
symbol demonstrating the awe and ulti-
mate power of the State. The scale of
penalties which the State can apply
against wrongdoers must range up from
the parking fine through imprisonment
of varying terms and confinement of
varying degrees of constriction to a
climax in the ultimate penalty of death.
It is enough that the sentence of death
be pronounced by the bewigged judge,
to be routinely commuted in most
cases; with the very occasional hang-
ing to show that the symbols of State
power have not been completely
deprived of real meaning.
If there is one fault in this book it
lies in the inclusion of the essay by
Dr. Max Charlesworth on “the moral
issues. One of those on-the-one-hand on-
the-nther-hand pieces, it reminded me

of spurious things I used to write in a
subject called “clear thinking” in sub-
intermediate. It is an insult to place
it with serious and eloquent works by
Dickens, Camus, Romilly, Lord Gar-
diner, George Orwell, Sir Ernest
Gowers, and Thorsten Sellin. Indeed,
together with some very valuable con-
tributions by Australians, Mr. Jones
has assembled a quite classic collec-
tion of abolitionist statements.
All the more pity that in his attempt
to be non-political he omits perhaps
the most pertinent of all, Arthur
Koestler’s: “Despite the inertia of man’s
imagination and its resistance to reason
and fact, the public is at long last be-
ginning to realise that it does not need
the hangman’s protection; that the
deliberate taking of life by the State
is unjustifiable on religious or philo-
sophic or scientific grounds; that hang-
ing by mistake will go on as long as
capital punishment, because the risk
is inherent in its nature; that the vast
majority of murderers are mentally
sick or the victims of circumstance who
can be reclaimed for human society;
that the substitution of the life sen-
tence for the death penalty exposes
the peaceful citizen to no greater risk
than that of being killed by lightning
in a bus queue . . .
“It is not only a question of the
individual lives which we offer annually
as a sacrifice to the stupid Moloch of
prejudice. The gallows is not only a
machine of death, it is a symbol. It is
the symbol of terror, cruelty, and
irreverence for life; the common
denominator of primitive savagery,
medieval fanaticism, and modern totali-
tarianism. It stands for everything man-
kind must reject, if mankind is to sur-
vive its present crisis.”
WINTER SOUNDS
With a concatenation of dog and pea-
splitting whistle
Comes the urchin of news, inevitable
as machinery.
With weather the coldest in years and
a folksong accompaniment
Rung out on leper-bells enters the
vendor of ice-cream.
To the postman and paper-boy news
is the backbone of history —
Neither Cerberus halts them nor gout
nor a hydra of wives.
When the ice-cream rrian cometh
unseasonably we do not query
The makers who know that his bell
rings not once but for all.
Not to hide but withdraw to the
sun-warmed back steps of the
dwelling,
There to overlook leaves that are
fallen and similar lives
Seems wiser than Solomon bent on
dispensing rough justice,
Even saner than Schopenhauer whip-
ping them back to the Pit.

Jazz: new directions in
a steady safety valve
By SANDRA HALL
OUTWARDLY, the El Rocco doesn’t
change. Walk in after an absence of
three years, and you may notice that
the bandstand’s in a different corner.
That’s all. The customers still don’t
talk much, coffee is still the strongest
drink on sale, and the row of record
covers on the wall is still the only con-
tribution to “decor.” As somebody said
accurately and succinctly one night last
week: “You come here for the jazz.”
Jazz musicians look upon the El
Rocco as a kind of safety valve the
only place in Sydney, in fact probably
in Australia, where they are free to
improvise and experiment with jazz. So
the sounds change and so do the faces
musicians switch groups, styles, and
sometimes countries. Chris Karan, now
with the Dudley Moore Trio in Lon-
don, was an El Rocco regular, as were
Freddie Logan, now with Tubby Hayes;
Mike Nock, who recently joined John
Handy in New York; Bruce Cale, a bass
player also with Handy; Lyn Christie,
who plays bass in the Tal Farlow Trio
in New York; and Warren Daley, a
drummer who left last year for New
York, where he plays with Cy Zeffner’s
group.
Of those who have stayed, the best
known is probably Don Burrows, whose
trio, comprising guitarist George Golla
and bass player Ed Gaston, appears at
the El Rocco each Wednesday night.
Burrows has for years been a übiquitous
figure on the Australian jazz scene
his are the arrangements behind many
of the radio, television, and cinema
commercials made here, and his clari-
net, saxophone, or flute is often heard on
recordings of Australian compositions.
Of all the musical influences which hum
or pound away at us every day, his is
less intrusive, but probably more potent
for all that.
At present, Burrows is excited about
several things he’s been commis-
sioned to write the music for the locally
produced film “Two Thousand Weeks,”
he plays regularly with a group of
classical flautists (“It’s a kind of work-
shop we hold in our homes. Each of
us has several weeks to prepare a piece
for it”), and he has just organised a
new group which plays at the El Rocco
on Thursdays. This last move was
prompted by the return of Julian Lee,
a pianist and arranger who has been
living in Los Angeles for the past five
years writing music for people like
George Shearing, Peggy Lee, Bud
Shank, and Gerry Mulligan.
Lee, a New Zealander, who has been
blind from birth, met Shearing in
1960, when the English jazz pianist
came to Australia, and three years later,
he left to work in America at Shearing's
suggestion. “I started working with him
as soon as I arrived,” he says, “and he
introduced me to all the rest. But the
U.S. is not a comfortable country to
live in. I’ve got a three-year-old child
and I thought I could give her a better
start here.”
Ed Gaston and Jack Dougan, an
Englishman who used to be resident
drummer at Ronnie Scott’s Club in
London, have joined Burrows and Lee
in the new group, which features, in a
rather radical departure from Burrows’
usual style, a fiugelhorn and piano. “It
will be a change for me,” Burrows says,
“but most of the boys have different
outlets and are trying new directions
and I felt it was time I did, too. Be-
cause of Julian’s blindness, a lot of our
work will have to be spontaneous, be-
cause we won’t be able to write any-
thing down. So we’ll have to wait and
see what develops.”
One of Sydney’s most determined
musical innovators is John Sangster,
first known as a trumpeter and drum-
mer with the Graeme Bell band in the
hey-day of “trad,” and most recently
as a composer and percussionist on
record and with Don Burrows’ group.
But last year, Sangster, eternally recep-
tive to new influences and new
impulses, became interested in pop
music’s metamorphosis into something
more complex than before, and he
initiated concerts in psychedelic music
at the El Rocco. Now with several
other jazz musicians who’ve turned to
pop, he plays three nights a week at
the Whisky Au Go Go, then moves
with the group to the El Rocco on
Sunday night for jazz edged with the
sound of rhythm and blues.
This group is led by Col Nolan,
who was a sales executive before he
gave up his job for jazz eight years ago.
He was playing intermittently at the
El Rocco before he left Sydney for
Hong Kong last year with a group
called the “In People.” And when he
returned to Sydney, he also returned
to the El Rocco. “A lot of jazz groups
are switching to pop. Max Merrit and
the Meteors is the most obvious
example, and Stewart Spears played at
the El Rocco for two years. In the
beginning, with most musicians, it’s
probably just a case of bread and but-
ter because they’re not earning money
from jazz. Then pop music becomes
more interesting. There’s a fair amount
of experimentation in it these days. We
play a few of our own songs and
arrangements.”
Dave Macßae, a young New Zeal-
ander who writes pop music arrange-
ments for Festival records, has reversed
the usual jazz-into-pop process. In New
Zealand, he played in rock-’n-roll bands
Don Burrows (left) and group at the El Rocco...a time for new outlets


before realising there was more
to music than three chords on a piano.
“I lost a lot of money, of course.
There’s just no audience at present for
the kind of jazz I’m trying which is
music as full of improvisation as pos-
sible. I make most money from pop
music, which I’m still interested in,
because it’s improved so much with
strings, brass, everything. And I’m try-
ing to get the best possible sound into
the arrangements I do for Festival.
More and more, pop music is demand-
ing good musicians and good arrangers.
But there’s still no living to be made
from my kind of jazz, and the El Rocco
is an outlet, a place where we play
just for the sheer enjoyment of playing
together. Ed Gaston and Alan Turn-
bull, a drummer from Melbourne, make
up the rest of the group.”
Since jazz is hardly a commercial
proposition in this country, most music-
ians earn a living by working in clubs
and as members of television studio
orchestras.
The El Rocco was established eight
years ago by Arthur James, the son of
the Armenian family who own the
Kings Cross block in which it is housed.
He was then an art student, and many
of his friends were jazz musicians, so
he had some conception of their prob-
lems, although his own musical tastes
are more folk than jazz.
At present, he is touring German jazz
cellars in a search for ideas on which
to model El Rocco’s projected expan-
sion for it’s been decided that El
Rocco will change perhaps into a
licensed restaurant with jazz. The jazz,
I’m told, won’t change, but the music-
ians are hoping the size of the audiences
will.
FROZEN IMAGERY
ART/ELWYN LYNN
German Painters of Today. N.S.W.
Art Gallery, Sydney.
SURVEY TIME is upon us; 21 Ger-
mans looking refreshed after the Adel-
aide Festival are vying with the crafty
Scandinavians at the N.S.W. Gallery,
and 39 Hard-Edge Australians plus
James Doolin, an American who had
a few influential years in Melbourne,
will show over 90 sculptures and paint-
ings at Victoria’s new Cultural Centre
on August 22. This first-ever ideologi-
cal survey with its prestigious venue
has aroused mutterings among those
Antipodeans who regard themselves as
founding fathers or legitimate, favorite
sons of Australian art.
Antipodeans are not likely to march
in protest as students have just done at
Venice’s Biennale and Kassel’s Docu-
menta; at Venice, students, partly in
protest against the Biennale’s com-
mercialism, disrupted the scene for a
few days, but at Kassel the black-and-
red flags in what the “Weser Kurier”
called a mini-demonstration were
against the nature of the Kassel Docu-
Woman with Gasmask, by Wolf Vostell...a nasty moment isolated
menta’s fourth great survey. The Ger-
mans were probably cleverer than the
Venetians in circumventing riots, for
the organisers issued three Documenta
Bulletins before the opening on June
26, in which critics from various
countries let off steam about the Docu-
menta so that works of art could have
their say when the verbal battles were
over.
The theme of the Documenta is the
art of today. This means that of the
150 artists, 57 are Americans: “It’s
a sell-out to the Americans,” says
Werner Schreid in Documenta Bulletin
11. Werner Schmalenbach, who writes
the introduction to the catalogue of the
German show at Sydney’s Gallery,
resigned from the committee because,
like others, he wanted another 1964
Documenta when the survey of the
present showed its modern origins. The
1959 Documenta dealt with the
founders of the 20th century and the
art of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko,
and so on. In 1955, of 148 artists,' 58
were Germans (today there are 19,
hence some bitterness), but in 1955
International Art meant the modern
European tradition.
It does so no longer and it is clear
that there are a number of international
styles; at Kassel the new Construc-
tivism, says the “Hamburger Abend-
blatt,” dominates, especially with lights
and mirrors engaged in re-creating one’s
environment. (It’s not all severe and
crisp; one work, a balloon that collapsed
at the opening, is over 90 yards high
and 20 yards wide, and Olitski’s mistv
painting is about twenty square yards of
shifting vapor.) There is, too, a huge
Graubner moving in the uncanny man-
ner of his pieces at the N.S.W. Gallery;
he, Antes, Braning, Geiger, and Klap-
heck are at Kassel and Jens Lausen,
who is used as dead-end decor in Syd-
ney, is at Venice.
I have briefly mentioned these anti-
mainstream Germans twice before and
here should like to stress features that
seem to ai'ise from that cool, calculated
stillness and weird irrationality of
Cranach and Baldung Grun, for most
of these Germans isolate and freeze a
movement, moment, or mood. Despite
their sharp color, Lausen’s surreal,
geometrical landscapes are certainly
frozen; Piene’s Red Black Fire Flower
is a stain on white caught before it
sinks into the canvas; and if the general
coolness relates to the romanticism of
Caspar David Friedrich, Piene’s Brown
Fire Flower, gently unfurling, is the
romanticism of warm mists. Georg
Pfahler’s Double Swing Tex of hard-
edge bands across blue swings, but com-
pared with local and U.S. new abstrac-
tion it is as remarkably stilled as Krwit’s
white sharp-edge letters, some brilliantly
overlapped, on black; even Rupprecht
Geiger’s fiercely luminous orange-red
about a white square looks like cap-
tured light. Mavignier’s tightly ordered
patterns of tiny dots look fixed for ever
and Konrad Klapheck’s The Oracle,
which is a severely highlighted, olive
sewing machine on uniform browrl, and
looking like Magritte in a sullen mood,
has an odd, remote stillness. It should
be noted that while these Germans
eschew Antipodean anecdotalism and
suburban moods, they like the metaphy-
sical and the kinkily literary; another
one of Klapheck’s sewing machines (not
shown here) that resembles a needling
female is called The Logic of Woman.
Isolators of the nasty moment for
cool scrutiny are Vostell, whose photo-
montage nude in a gasmask is sur-
rounded by those empty balloons from
“comic” papers, and Paul Wunderlich,
whose embryos with legs like breasts
and benippled buttocks float, as it were,
in the circle of a periscope thrust into
beautifully glowing amniotic fluid.
Dieter Krieg’s bound hand emerging
from pink buttocks adds to the queasi-
ness, but Horst Antes, who deserves his
European reputation, neutralises similar
qualities with his attractive Picassoid
Expressionism. Not all is so intense:
Gecelli’s Back is sweet French intime,
Hochme is nervously lively and Mack’s
grey ribbons must be the most self-
effacing signs around, but the prevailing
note, as with Schumacher’s blue board
cratered with black holes, is of the
uneasy and uncanny on the examination
table. It’s a wonder all the flags were
not black at the Kassel demonstrations.


DISTINCTION AND VALUE
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
TWO SIGNIFICANT events in Syd-
ney’s musical life occurred in the
course of one week: Nigel Butterley’s
“Meditations of Thomas Traherne”
received its first airing at the Town
Hall and the Sydney String Quartet be-
gan a series of four recitals at the Con
servatorium with its new first fiddler,
Carl Pini.
Comparisons are not always odious
and it was almost impossible not to
contrast the Butterley with Peter Scul-
thorpe’s recent “Sun Music IV” which
was played at the last Youth Concert.
Much of the Sculthorpe could have
been designed for that proverbial group
who never had a lesson in their lives.
Glissandi travelled in opposing direc-
tions, bows wandered on to the wrong
side of the bridge, and the bases were
required to have their backs scratched,
resulting in the sort of noise which
prompts parents to say to their young,
“Stop it, or I’ll clobber you.” Yet the
piece was impressive, even memorable,
and was certainly an extraordinary in-
centive to individual imaginative excur-
sions, apart from being a thoroughly
professional piece of craftsmanship.
The hedonism which prompted the
Sculthorpe is not necessarily the anti-
thesis of the mysticism which prompted
the Butterley. I suppose the world is
divided into those people who regard
mysticism as a perversion and those
who regard it as the highest form of
sensibility; but effects often differ radi-
cally from their causes, and the seedy
side of mysticism was conspicuously
absent from Mr. Butterley’s work.
Oddly, the two pieces were evocative
in much the same way, yet on the
technical side they had little in com-
mon. The “Meditations” required all
members of the orchestra to play their
instruments in the way they were
taught, which must have been gratifying
to the players who are always much
happier when given something which
makes the years spent slaving over a
hot fingerboard worth while. A strik-
ing feature of the work was its con-
sistency; there was no trace of the
pastiche, here was a piece unmistak-
ably by the composer of “Laudes” as
much as the composer of “The Snowy-
breasted Warbler.” Nigel Butterley’s
music is distinctive, sensitive, and a
salutary reminder that refinement is
not necessarily bloodless, for I detected
some passion in the lower strings,
quickly assuaged, however, by the sex-
less pipings of a delightful group of
young recorder players from Beecroft.
The concert began with an accurate
performance of a Handel Concerto
Grosso in which the concertino, Donald
Hazelwood, Ronald Ryder, and Lois
Simpson, achieved admirable 'balance.
I think the ABC should seriously con-
sider amplifying their beautiful look-
ing harpsichord, although if they take
this step there is bound to be a scream
from some quarters on aesthetic
grounds.
Undoubtedly the Hurlstone Choir
starred in the Mozart “Requiem,”
which took up the second half of the
program. Rock-steady in pitch, even
when singing pianissimo, thoroughly
conversant with their notes and homo-
geneous in tone, they acquitted them-
selves with distinction, bringing an
artistic unity to a work which suffers
so badly from the dichotomy of
Mozart’s genius and Suessmayr’s talent.
So many of the Haydn quartets are
almost concertos for the first fiddle
that they constitute an admirable
choice for introducing a new player.
Haydn’s Opus 74, No. 1, had not pro-
gressed very far before the quality
of the Sydney String Quartet’s new
first violinist was manifest. Carl Pini
is a beautiful player; urbane and aris-
tocratic; there is no trace of the peasant
fiddler in his work. Although he must
have been under considerable strain,
knowing that he was on trial in the
ears of his audience, he nevertheless
gave no indication that he was other
than completely at ease and he fitted
Carl Pini
Nigel Butterley
into the group as a hand into a glove.
Mr. Pini is no power-house virtuoso, but
to those who regard beauty of sound
and elegance of phrasing as of prime
importance he is certainly a most valu-
able addition to Sydney’s musical scene.
Hindemith’s String Trio, Opus 34,
was played by Robert Ingram, Robert
Pikler, and John Painter, and its com-
plexities never became tortuous; in fact,
the performance was an object lesson
in clarity and logic. It is not easy for
any player to follow a passage played
by Robert Pikler, yet Ingram and
Painter mirrored the deft fleetness of
the viola with commendable aplomb.
The pianist in the F Minor Quintet
of Brahms was Diane Selmon, and she
contributed to the opulence of the
strings with some appropriately
vigorous, if somewhat over lusty, play-
ing. What a golden torrent of sound
this work is; there are times when the
heart is in its rightful place when it
is on the sleeve, and this is one of them.
For the life of me I can never under-
stand why some people find Brahms
dull; after all, he brought to music a
strength and a warmth which is rarely
found even among the greatest com-
posers. Surely there can have been
few members of the Conservatorium
audience who were not swept away by
the sheer exuberance of it all.
HARSH INSIGHT
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
Cool Hand Luke. Director, Stuart
Rosenberg.
“THAT LUKE WAS a real world-
shaker!” says an admiring fellow convict
after the eponymous hero’s death. But
I doubt if the film as such will be so
described by the technique-obsessed
movie buffs of today it has no par-
ticular invention in the way of camera
techniques or editing, so will probably
be shrugged off as a terribly vieille
vague. This is a pity, because it’s a very
good movie indeed and will, I hope,
be seen and admired by people such as
me who just like seeing a really good
film. There must be millions of us,
after all.
In fact, the technical aspects of the
film are most competent. Stuart Rosen-
berg lets his story tell itself straight-
forwardly, with no juxtapositions of
time or interlocking shots. (They can
be highly effective, but a movie like
this shows that they’re not exactly
essential.) The only thing like a flash-
back is done by implication, in Luke’s
short talk with his dying mother when
she visits him in jail a sequence
which blends a rueful humor with deep
feeling, thanks in great part to the
playing of Paul Newman and Jo Van
Fleet.
But, mainly, “Cool Hand Luke” is
remarkable for its acting (particularly
the central performance) and for the
complex construction of its script. The
story starts out simply, but deeper
layers keep revealing themselves. Luke
is picked up on a simple D and D
charge and, because he’s been destroying
parking meters, is sent to a chain gang
for two years. He is a man who has
found it impossible to fit into organised
society and only wants to be left to go
his own way.
But to Luke, the loner, their admira-
tion soon becomes a burden and a
scourge. He rejects them, only to be
rejected by them when his spirit is
broken by the guards’ ill-treatment.
When he regains his old form and
makes yet another escape, their admira-
tion is increased, and although he tries
to explain to the only man with whom
he has even approached real friendship
that he was only acting for himself, he
ends up becoming a legend after all.
Based on a novel by Donn Pearce, who
also collaborated on the screenplay, this
is a harsh story, yet inspiring without
being “inspirational.” People like Luke
are edgy, uncomfortable, impossible to
“integrate with society,” and for that
very reason the world needs a few of
them around to stir things up.
It would be difficult beyond me,
in any case to find much fault with
Paul Newman’s performance as Luke.
He doesn’t rely on any chip-on-the-
shoulder surliness to convey his alien-
ation from society. Luke is generally
affable and easy-going, with a pleasant
smile and amiable word guaranteed to
be obscurely maddening to anyone in


authority; but he is always at one
remove from the rest of the world.
The movie is rather slanted in favor
of the prisoners they’re tough but
basically good blokes, whereas the
guards are uniformly sadistic and hypo-
critical but, after all, the story is
told from a convict’s viewpoint. And,
presumably, the picture of conditions
in a chain gang is comparatively
accurate, since I haven’t heard of any
protests. If so, Simon Townsend just
didn’t know when he was well off.
MEMORIES OF CONDON
JAZZ/ROLLO LADNIER
JAZZ CONTINUES to make ground
working in from the periphery of the
Australian entertainment scene. If this
is not exactly demonstrated in local
support for local jazz (there are those
who look back nostalgically to the more
golden days of Graeme Bell, the Bar-
nards, and the Port Jackson group) at
least jazz interest grows in other ways.
A six-night-a-week program by Arch
McKirdy supplements the long-sus-
tained dedication to the cause of Eric
Child, Kym Bonython, and others on
ABC radio. Television shows such as
the BBC’s “Jazz 625” and MCA’s
“Leonard Feather on Jazz” have pro-
jected the performers from the late
Henry “Red” Allen to Art Blakey into
the living-room; the large “specials” on
most TV channels Bob Hope, Jack
Benny, Dean Martin regularly intro-
duce reigning identities like Louis
Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and Oscar
Peterson as guest stars. Visits to Aus-
tralia by the jazz groups of Brubeck,
Armstrong, and Eddie Condon are still
fresh in our minds.
Full marks and some recognition then
to the Australian record companies
who now regularly put out the best jazz
discs internationally available from re-
issues of older classic performances (as
Festival is doing from the English Ace
of Hearts label, with some glorious
Andy Kirk and Chick Webb albums,
and Nevil Sher.burn with his Mel-
bourne-based Swaggie label) to modern
performances on the U.S.A. Contem-
porary series, presented by local RCA.
Mention of Condon reminds me that
his ex-Chicagoans, who have given a
new dimension and character to New
York jazz over the years, are out in
full force in Eddie Condon’s “Treasury
of Jazz,” one of the recent excellent
jazz issues from the CBS Harmony
label (HA 059). Indeed, one of my
happiest memories of the Eddie Con-
don band in its old haunt in Greenwich
Village was to see Wild Bill Davison
seraphically chewing gum as Gene
Schroeder beat it out on piano to Cutty
Cutshall’s tearing trombone chords, and
Pee Wee Russell’s asthmatic clarinet
phrases—and then when his turn came,
casually parking his gum underneath
his chair and taking off like Gabriel.
Some of the best jazz standards are
worked over in this release, including
the undervalued Ira and George Gersh-
win tune “I’ve Got a Crush on You”
with Cutshall and the Goodmanesque
clarinet of Peanuts Hucko, clean as a
whistle compared with Pee Wee and
every whit as soulful (“The Peanuts
Hucko story,” observes Condon in the
background), dominating the ensembles.
The best track, however, is “Sometimes
I’m Happy,” where the trio opening
of Davison’s cornet lead with Cutshall
and Pee Wee improvising in harmony
is one of the most memorable and
beautiful bits of jazz I’ve heard for a
long time.
Condon’s insistent background guitar
(when he plays, like his Australian
counterpart, Ray Price, he is oblivious
to audience, space, and time and
jazz is all) is a constant factor in all
the tracks; on the other hand, this is
uncommonly good music because of the
casual artistry of all the soloists,
You can bet your boots that when
Pee Wee Russell takes over with George
Wettling drumming in the background
(as in “Three-two-one Blues”) it’s be-
cause the bottle has been passed to
Wild Bill; and that while Billy Butter-
field was taking a high register trumpet
solo on his own, Wild Bill and Cut-
shall were falling about over something
said to them by Gene Schroeder, him-
self so helpless with laughter that Ralph
Sutton had to play piano instead. (This
rarely heard pianist with his Dixieland
touch, sparkles on “I’ve Found a New
Baby.”) And, of course, Bud Freeman
was at the session all the time, giving
moral support even if he didn’t appear
in the line-up. Of such stuff is Condon
jazz made and this album ranks with
the best of it.
Communicating
TRADING IN NEWS
SYDNEY stringers for the Fleet Street
newspapers guaranteed themselves fat
cheques at the end of the month with
their coverage of the Mellish affair.
Most London papers ran long and illus-
trated accounts of the drama at Glen-
field, which was precisely tailored by
time and circumstances for the front
pages of London’s two afternoon sheets.
With help from the wire services in
Australia news of the Glenfield siege
also penetrated into Britain’s provincial
Press. After all, a good story is a good
story anywhere. Even the New York
“Times” and other major United
States papers carried the saga of Wally
and Norman, although they confined
their coverage to the inside pages.
But apart from the exploits of its
sportsmen, its soldiers, and its screw-
balls, such as Mellish, Australia provides
precious little news day by day for the
American Press, radio, and television.
Certainly the balance of Press trading
in the minutiae of life is heavily in
America’s favor.
In the past month Australian troops
in Vietnam have had an occasional
mention in reports of the fighting from
Saigon, financial pages of the larger
newspapers have carried short items on
mining activities in Western Australia,
and Canberra has provided several
items on the Gorton Government and
reaction to the Prime Minister’s Wash-
ington visit. Except for unusual Can-
berra items, American newspapers run
little hard news from the Australian
capital.
A major exception is the “Christian
Science Monitor,” a nationally circula-
ted daily which maintains a fulltime
correspondent (A. E. Norman) in Aus-
tralia and which recently has been
printing a special series of impressions
of Australia by its Washington corres-
pondent, David Willis, a native Austra-
lian making his first trip home in seven
years.
With Immigration Minister Snedden
now actively courting settlers from the
U.S., many unsettled Americans reading
about Wally Mellish must have felt that
Australia was just like home.
SELLING RADIO *
THE COSTS of commercial produc-
tion and air-time have driven many a
middle-sized advertiser back to “the
poor man’s telly” of commercial radio.
So the older medium flourishes, and
the shares in many a metropolitan
station are held in the sort of awe
usually reserved for Western Mining.
But the radio medium remains
mysteriously vulnerable to shifts in
audience loyalty. Ratings rise and fall
far more quickly and inexplicably than
newspaper or magazine circulations as
has been evidenced most recently by
the sad decline of Melbourne’s 3XY.
Although they play the same records
as most, their ratings of late suggest
that the station’s announcers have been
outnumbering the listeners. So no one
was very surprised to learn that the
“Age” had just bought 50 percent of
the shares in Efftee Broadcasters Pty.
Ltd., the company which operates the
station. The name Efftee derives from
the initials of the late F. T. Thring,
who founded XY in 1934, when its
manager was Tom Holt, the late Prime
Minister’s father.
Radio 3XY made its first broadcast
from the stage of the Princess Theatre
in Melbourne, and until recently oper-
ated from studios behind the theatre’s
dress circle. The fortunes of Melbourne
actor Frank Thring have, presumably,
been swelled by the sale of shares, but
the “Age” isn’t broadcasting the
amount. J


TRADING ON THE PAST
Bryan Condon and David Fitchew sell 1930s gear and
rejuvenated furniture at the “Daisy Chain," Darlinghurst
Old clothes and jewellery draw attention in the Moncur
Street market-style “Kaleidoscope” of Grant Roberts
BY SANDRA HALL
JUST AS THE general store grew out
of the needs of the Old West, Sydney’s
Paddington, now a kind of shrine for
the worship of “things old,” has its own
sort of shop. It’s a shop which has
several guises—from the “junk” to the
antique. But the common denominator
is age, whether the product on sale is a
so-called “trad antique,” like a piece
of Dresden china, or a 30-year-old fur
cape. In some, the youngest thing there
is the proprietor, and the merchandise
runs the full gamut —scrubbed furniture,
old clothes, jewellery, brass bedsteads,
old advertising posters, or, as the sign
outside one shop, “Bygones,” puts it—
“antiques and things just old.”
It is a necessarily incestuous business.
Most of the dealers assiduously keep
themselves informed about the competi-
tion, and the same objet d’art has been
known to reappear in successive shops
in the Eastern Suburbs, its price taking
a leap each time. When this happens,
resignation, rather than indignation,
see'ms the only practical reaction. “It’s
happened to most of us and there’s
nothing much you can do. It’s just one
of the facts of the business,” one dealer
told us. As far as age goes, one of the
most spectacular establishments in the
area is “George’s Opportunity Shop,”
beside which every other shop must be
regarded as derivative.
“George’s” Oxford Street premises
may have changed hands several times,
but for the past 60 years it has been a
junk shop—three storeys in which junk
nestles and proliferates in a gloriously-
unchecked mass of 'miscellanea. A plas-
ter of paris foot rests in an aluminium
saucepan, a surfboard shares a wall with
a baby’s swing, a croquet mallet leans
against a pink brocade jacket probably
worn last by the principal boy in the
Tivoli’s long-gone production of “Cin-
derella on Ice.” “George” is George
Warnecke large, cheery, and un-
worried. He grew up in the Paddington
of the Depression days, bought the shop
after he left the Army, and these days
runs it and a transport agency, in addi-
tion to being a member of most clubs,
societies, and civic groups in Padding-
ton, from the Paddington School Old

He can think of no other reason
for owning the shop than he likes “old
things. ’ “It’s the human element that
fascinates me. Look at this,” he says,
extracting a rusty and mysterious
machine from its perch on a shelf be-
hind a plaster dog. "What do you think
this is? It’s a cherry-seeding machine.
American. Just think they went to
all that trouble to get the stones out
of cherries. I don’t like to sell it.” The
collection goes on. A machine to bottle
your own lemonade, a cricket ball
with a bronze plague which says it
was used in the 1907 Test (“I had
five of those. I’ve sold the others”), a
Spanish breastplate and helmet, which
may be 400 years old George is
checking—some Edison records, and a
mysterious metal case with a shape
similar to those silver covers used to
keep food hot in old and exclusive
English restaurants. “What do you think
it is. It’s a hatbox for the Boer War
soldiers’ pith helmets. I bought a few
of these at an Army surplus auction—
I’ve sold the others. One woman
bought one for a bread bin, somebody
else is growing indoor plants in one,
and another customer bought one for
a cat’s travelling box. She punched
holes in the top and put a cushion in
it. Very good it was.
“This,” he continues, indicating a
framed collection of medals mounted
on velvet, “is a made-up collection of
the insignia of all the troops in the
Boer War. And that thing in the middle
is a box of chocolates Queen Victoria
sent the soldiers as a New Year present
in 1900. The chocolates are still in
there.” “They say the chocolates are
in there, George,” says George’s mother,
Mrs. Gladys Warnecke lively, good-
humored, and 71. She looks after the
shop for nothing (“put that in or the
tax people’ll be after me”) and because
“you get maudlin if you stay at home.
Before long, you’re in a mental home,
and I mightn’t have many brains left,
but I want to keep the ones I’ve got.”
Everybody comes to “George’s,” and
one suspects there are dressed-up
pieces of Georgiana in more than a
few Paddington houses and shops.

A PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT
OF THE
CHATEAU YOUNGSTERS
IN 808 RAYMOND’S “Project ’67”
documentary on wine, cameraman San-
dor Siro lovingly plays his lens over a
still stretch of water, an oxbow of a
stream which runs into the Goulburn
River. The camera pans over the water
to the conventional stately gums by
the side of the lagoon, then climbs the
trees agilely to spot the top of a tower
through the foliage. There is a pause,
then the watcher is zoomed in on the
magic carpet of the telescopic lens to
a close-up view of an Aboriginal watch-
tower. The sequence is one of the
most effective in the program and it
is obvious that both producer and
cameraman were quite taken with the
place. This is not surprising, for the
place is Chateau Tahbilk.
Chateau Tahbilk is one of the most
picturesque wineries and cellars in
Australia. It has been the subject for
dozens of articles and pictures and
hundreds of photographs. Almost every
book written about wine in this coun-
try features it, and no writer doing a
series for his paper would dream of
omitting it. We have read, some of us
scores of times, about Richard Horne,
the English poet whom Dickens tried
to stop from coming to Victoria, and
who helped found the Goulburn Vine-
yard Company in 1860. We know how
the intended purchase of the Noorilim
Estate didn’t go through because of
the drunken death of Andrew Sinclair,
and how they transferred their atten-
tion to the nearby Tabilk (without
the “h”) run. We know of the labors
of Ford and Bear, of the low-arched
“New” cellar built in 1875, and of
the bulge in the right-hand corner
which threatened to bring the lot dbwn
and never has, and of the distinction
the vineyards achieved when its wines
were served to the Queen in 1953 at
the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association luncheon. But do we know
much of the wines?
Even in early 1965, when I wrote of
Tahbilk in these pages, I said, “Chateau
Tahbilk is much praised and publicised
for its beauty, but in this case it was
not the beauty that alone won me. It
was the red and white wine.” Even
then I was anxious to leave the lyrics
to the other, and better, writers while
I tasted the wine.
True, others have talked of the wines.
Sam Benwell, in his excellent “Journey
to Wine in Victoria,” gives a chapter
to them but discusses general styles
rather than specifics. Max Lake, in
his joyously opinionated “Classic
Wines of Australia” (and many of his
opinions I joyously share with him),
even had a go at a vintage chart. I
was with him when owner Eric Pur-
brick pondered through the various
vintages. But in neither case had they
actually come to grips with the wines
in a truly definitive sense. So we set
out to try to do just that.
First, you have to collect whatever
wines you can. We decided to stick to
the reds, to the Shiraz and Cabernet
varieties. Bottles were bludged and bor-
rowed from friends and collectors. Max
himself brought a couple along, and
Eric Purbrick dug into his bits and
pieces. We fixed on a day when Eric
would be in town, and we held the
whole thing in his honor. He was also
there to answer questions and suppress
insurgents.
The first thing he said was, “I don’t
think I’ve ever seen such a line-up of
wines of any one type, and certainly
I’ve never seen anywhere near so many
Tahbilks together. The conclusions will
be interesting.”
Well, I’m sad, or happy, or bemused
enough to say, there are no conclusions.
And no profound definitions, either.
Tahbilk reds are supposed generally to
be quite distinctive, to have a specific
set of flavors and varietal styles. The
palate is said ito be clean and vinous,
the tannin marked and assertive. The
reds are supposed to have plenty of
body, and many claim the pressings
wines are the best, though they need
lo's of age. Certainly some of this is
true in a general sense, but what this
large tasting did, as have others we
have done before, was to show that each
wine-maker puts out markedly different
wines in different years.
The first thing we noticed was that
some of the relatively younger wines
tasted the best. Tahbilk reds are said
to improve for years, and the venerable
wine that was found in a cache in the
cellar (it was of the 1876 vintage)
was stili sound when opened. There is
no doubt that many of them last, and
last well, but I was surprised at the
few which were not in good condition
because I didn’t expect to see them.
Perhaps the fact that they came from
so many different cellars has something
to do with this.
The 1958 Shiraz was the best example
of that variety. It was an outstanding
wine of the lighter style. The nose was
voluminous and showed big fruit flavors
that had acquired plenty of bottle
character. The palate was light and
clean, with complex flavors and no
thinness. The tannin was softer and
lighter than with many of the others,
and the acid was good. A good wine
and the first bottle to be emptied, which
is always a good sign.
The second-best Shiraz was a different
bunch of grapes altogether. This was
the Bin 28 of 1960, a straight pressings
wine. Of course, the palate was much
bigger and had less finesse than the
’5B. Of course, the tannin finish was
extremely firm and will be there for
years. But at least the wine has the
fruit to balance the tannin and one
dreams of the future bouquet. Already
the nose was considerable, with a lovely
floral character and plenty of it. This
CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM UN DEMANS
CELLAR MANAGER:
One of the most remarkable features of
the Australian wine trade in recent years
has been the consumption swing to table
wines as distinct from Sherries and
Dessert Wines and most particularly
in the quality, matured-in-the-bottle
table wines in which Lindeman (Hold-
ings) Limited and its subsidiaries
Lindemans Wines Pty. Limited, Leo
Burings Wines Pty. Ltd., and Rouge
Homme Wines Pty. Limited specialise.
For some years existing vineyards of
Lindemans, Leo Burings, and Rouge
Homme in the Hunter River, Clare and
Barossa Valleys and at Corowa and
Coonawarra have been substantially ex-
panded and/or renewed, and new
properties in some of the areas pur-
chased. Most particularly has this been
so in the Hunter River Valley and at
Coonawarra in the South East of South
Australia.
In the latter area the company now
owns over 550 acres of the best and
choicest vineyard land in the heart of
the district, and current plans are to
have all this under vines within a few
years.
Further expansion at Coonawarra could
only be achieved on marginal vineyard
country as other wine companies have
found. This solution was not considered
acceptable to Lindeman (Holdings)
Limited and an intensive search of the
whole South East was therefore under-
taken. After many months of search and
examination a property was discovered
at Padthaway some 55 miles north of
Coonawarra. Detailed foot by foot
examination of the soil followed, to-
gether with rainfall and weather
records.
It was soon realised that parts of Pad-
thaway were closely related in soil
structure to Coonawarra, with the added
advantages of a significantly warmer
climate, and enormous reserves of under-
ground water some 10ft. below the
surface. A decision was therefore made
to purchase the property in question
some 1060 acres and the negotiations
have now been completed.
Planting of Padthaway will commence
during 1969.
At a conservative estimate we will be
producing 1 million gallons of very high
quality Dry White and Dry Red each
year from our vineyards in the South
East of South Australia when plantings
are complete.
Already a new winery has been erected
at Coonawarra, utilising the very latest
equipment and design to, produce wine
of the very highest quality at a minimum
of cost. The buildings, plant and tanks
have been designed and constructed to
allow progressive expansion as new
plantings come into production, and a
recent tasting of our 1968 vintage
wines, processed in the new winery, was
exciting proof of the soundness of our
plans.
Closer to home, vineyard expansion is
also continuing, and 1968 and 1969 will
see the completion of planting of our
new Steven Vineyard at Pokolbin in the
Hunter River Valley.

wine is a keeper, one that should last
at least 20 years.
Of the others, the ’64 and ’65 were
both good wines, light, pleasant, agree-
able, showing good fruit and character
but both suffering from a trace of sul-
phur. One supposes that this could
vanish and leave nothing but quality.
The rest of the Shiraz wines were rela-
tively undistinguished. There was a
merchant bottling of a ’62 which was
thin and unbalanced, another ’62 which
was a big butch of a wine, all blood
and thunder and tannin, a quite pleas-
ant ’6l, come to think of it, a corked
’6O, a dumb,- hard ’57, a big, gusty,
pungent, almost caramelised ’54, and
an oxidised ’4B which was a damn
shame.
I did not necessarily expect the
Cabernets to be a better class, but they
were. There was an outstanding young
wine, and more of that later. The
’64 had good style, a pleasant flavor,
and a firm palate. The ’63 suffered
from excess tannin but will still mature
well. There were two ’62s, the ordinary,
which was very good, indeed, and the
Bin 26, another pressings wine which
had a load of wine abundance, tannin,
body, fruit, and guts. A Falstaff of a
wine. Another very good special bin
followed the Bin 22 of ’6l, a wine of
lovely balance and style, with just a
hint of ripe, sun-scorched grapes in the
flavor. This was my second - favorite
Cabernet. The Bin 27 of the same year
I didn’t like, it being slightly austere
and a trifle dirty. The fruit had fallen
away and the whole wine seemed coarse
and -unbalanced.
The non-bin ’6l, one could scarcely
call it a has-bin, had good fruit and
flavor but lacked complexity a
slightly empty type of wine. The ’6O
was good and straightforward. Not
much subtlety, little finesse, but good
drinking now. The ’59 Bin 26 seemed to
lack fruit and had a hole in the middle
palate. A much better wine was the
’5B, one of the top wines of the tasting,
which had a developed bouquet with
good oak and Cabernet flavors showing,
a good firm palate, and a soft, per-
sistent tannin finish.
But the best Cybernet was the
youngest wine shown, that of ’65. This
had a mosit delightful nose, full of com-
plexities, with a hint of the Coonawarra
“mint” character. This carried through
to the flavor on the tongue. The finish
was clean and did not suffer from too
much tannin. The wine was very well
balanced and combined lightness with
finesse and plenty of flavor. A wine to
keep for a couple of years, and a wine
that will undoubtedly rank among the
best that Eric Purbrick has ever made.
And though this wine is no longer
available from the winery and cellars,
there is still plenty of it around in the
bottle shops if you can bother to look.
To me, the whole occasion was quite
emotional. And not only the chance to
taste so many Tahbilk wines.
At the risk of boring people, I will
repeat a story from “Cellarmaster’s
Guide to Australian Wines.”
For three years my marriage pro-
duced no fruit. The doctor commanded
us to take a holiday away from hotels,
so, naturally, we visited all the vine-
yards we could. On one day we visited
Tahbilk in the morning and for lunch,
and John Brown’s for the evening and
dinner.
It was a full day, and when we had
been back in Sydney for a time, we
found that my wife would have a child
nine months from the Tahbilk/Brown
visit.
What to call it? If it was a boy, I
could only call him Chateau Tahbilk
Cabernet Shiraz Milawa Shiraz Mon-
deuse Evans in honor of the day. But
it was a girl, and we called her Sally.
Sally is now over five years old and
enjoys Tahbilk wines.

Aunty ABC
Mr. O’Brien’s article on the ABC
(8., July 8) makes some fairly astute
observations of that enormous, grinding,
monolithic bureaucracy so affectionately
know as “Aunty ABC.” As an ex-
employee, I can see that he had his
nose close to the wind, and perhaps
sniffed more odious airs than many
fellow commentators, in spite of the
united bureaucratic front to keep the
doors of those hallowed portals firmly
shut.
One suggestion: has anyone thought
of impartially assessing the ABC’s actual
radio and, especially, TV output in
comparison to the manhours consumed
by the payroll? My fond memories of
languid work-dappled days would sug-
gest the outcome of such researches
would be very enlightening.

For tariff support
Peter Samuel, in “The High Art of
Anti-Development” (8., June 29), sets
out very clearly the need to establish
priorities in the use of Australian capi-
tal and manpower resources. What he
and many of your other contributors
do not seem to recognise, however, is
that the full use of these resources will
involve the production of many goods
and services at a cost substantially
higher than that at which equivalent
goods and services co'uld be obtained
from overseas sources. This is because
our scale of operations and internal
transport problems put us at a per-
manent cost disadvantage.
Writing under the heading “Austra-
lia: How Unlimited?” (8., June 22),
Brian Hoad complains about the con-
tinuation of tariff support for in-
dustries needing high levels of pro-
tection and then goes on to suggest
that, in order to discourage the emigra-
tion of skilled manpower, more atten-
tion should be given to the creation of
“exciting manufacturing and research
enterprises,” such as the aircraft and
computer industries. Anyone familiar
with these fields will recognise them as
being in the area where ultra-high levels
of protection or cost-plus contracts are
likely to be required well into the
foreseeable future.
However attractive the theoretical
free-trade world in which many econo-
mists would prefer to live, the fact re-
mains that protectionism in other
countries severely limits the range of
products for which it is sensible to in-
vest our capital to create export oppor-
tunities. It may be sensible to use spare
capacity to secure exports on a margi-
nal basis, but the major part of our
resources must be applied to local
needs (by all means after using cost-


benefit analysis to determine priorities).
If we appear to be paying a premium
above the level of import parity, this
surely is better than allowing the
resources to lie idle or to be under-
utilised.

China's borders
Mr. Gregory Clark really deserves a
prize for slippery polemics. Following
my review of his book, he wrote a
letter challenging me to provide
evidence for a statement that the
Chinese Government had laid the
propaganda basis for border claims
against its neighbors. I replied, giving
him his evidence and, in ending, quoted
the view of Professor C. P. Fitzgerald
that regaining alleged “lost territories”
was an important aim of Chinese
foreign policy. Now (8., July 13), Mr.
Clark comes back, not by commenting
on the evidence he asked for, or for
that matter expressing a difference of
judgment with Professor Fitzgerald or
myself. Instead, he says, that because
of its border propaganda, I have “con-
demned outright” China. Nowhere did
I do any such thing. I was concerned
not to condemn (or condone), but to
assess and to provide evidence for my
assessment.

Cosy comfort
Your film critic, Miss Tivey, has rarely
been noted for the high quality of her
reviews, and after reading her appall-
ingly inept comments on the Sydney
Film Festival, one can only hope that
she finds it increasingly difficult to
attend any theatres at all, not to
mention future film festivals. Let us
fervently hope that she chooses to
remain at home in cosy comfort before
her TV set, where she will find no end
of “jollier” films to suit her tastes.

Grenfell's festival
Grenfell, a small town of the old gold-
field days, was honored to have Mr.
Denis O’Brien attend the annual Henry
Lawson Festival and we treated him
as a man of importance in the literary
world. But, really, we did expect some-
thing more constructive (8., June 22)
from one who is so versed in the arts.
Though you may not like the Roman
Spectacle, this is what has to be done
to give the public a part in the festival,
and in so doing they pay their money
to enable us to give prizes to writers
and artists. Apart from statuettes, cash
awards of $250 to painting, $6O to pot-
tery, $lOO to poetry, and $lOO to prose
were given, and this, surely, will help
some budding writer to buy nibs and
some artists a tube of paint.
Grenfell has only a small population,
but at least it is trying to do some-
thing in the name of Henry Lawson
to stimulate the creative minds and it
is being done on a shoe-string allow-
ance of $5OO from the Government cul-
tural grant, plus what we can raise
by the Roman Spectacles. Over the
years, the festival has raised over
$7OOO which has gone to assist the
extension of the baths, the ambulance,
the High School library, the Youth
Centre, and other organisations. This
year any profits were to go to the
Senior Citizens appeal.
The fact that Henry was only here
for a month or two does not matter;
he was born at Grenfell and there is
a monument erected to this important
birth, and I think that it is a wonder-
ful tribute to the people of Grenfell
that they give up their Queen’s Birth-
day weekend each year to honor Law-
son, a great Australian.

Times past
Reading the article “Women with time
on their hands” (B., June 29) provokes
me to ask why it is that when a woman
takes a well-earned respite from her
exacting role as wife and mother to
attend yoga, art, pottery, or other
classes she is described as being restless
and having time on her hands, whereas
when her husband spends his weekend
golfing, fishing, sailing, or at bowls, he
is relaxing after a hard week’s work?
Surely this attitude is an anachronism.
It surprises me that The Bulletin should
encourage it.
P. J. Barratt

McAuley and de Chardin
In a 'book review of Teilhard de Char-
din, “A Guide to his Thought” (8.,
March 28), James McAuley designates
de Chardin “one of the world’s super
nuts,” in addition to being a Facist
cum neo-Marxist. It is easy to fix
tags on something one cannot under-
stand, but it passes my comprehension
how McAuley can write the following
hymn which is being widely sung in
Catholic churches at present:
“By your kingly power, O risen Lord,
all that Adam lost has been restored:
in Your resurrection be adored.”
without comparing it to Teilhard’s so-
often-reiterated thought, “The human
layer of the earth is wholly and con-
tinuously under the organising influx
of the incarnate Christ.” This, joined
to the injunction, “Be ye perfect as
your heavenly Father is perfect,” is
surely the spearhead of evolution and
at the same time the attainment of that
state that “Adam lost.” Perhaps
McAuley thinks as Father Leroy so
tellingly remarked, that “so many feel
that the real, unhappily, can have noth-
ing in common with the ideal.”

A dirtier war
Is Britain guilty of a policy of indirect
aggression (8., July 6) against the
republic of Biafra? Just how many
civilians must die for the big British oil
and property interests in the Nigeria-
Biafra war? The British Defence
Ministry refuses to say how much arms
and ammunition is being sent to the
Nigerian Army, as the planes carrying
the arms from Britain to the Nigerian
Army are loaded secretly at night. The
Nigerian war against the republic of
Biafra is a race against time, indirectly
for Britain, as the British do have big
oil and property interests in Biafra
worth millions, and so the British arms
are being used in a war that is being
fought with appalling ferocity and is
killing thousands of poor civilians, more
than the war in Vietnam is killing, but
no one is protesting. Why? Is it not un-
just to protest against one dirty war
and not another?

Science, mind, and mankind
In G. P. Molnar’s review of “A
Materialist Theory of the Mind” he
tells us a decision rests with science.
Is it possible to help science decide
in time? Is science researching the
right theories? Is it possible, for
instance, that the Steady Staters and
the Big Bangers are both partly wrong
about the beginning of the universe?
Whether Mind is material or
immaterial, or a bit of both, can best
be discovered, it seems to me, by re-
searching the substance whose reflec-
tions give Mind its sense of reality. To
do otherwise is to embark on a journey
through great wastes of time. For man,
cognition lies in the substance, not in
the shadow of it.
The task for science, then, might be
to carefully consider taking a look along
a new road back to the origin of
matter. Each new marvellous discovery
points ever more convincingly to some-
thing in between the Steady State and
the Big Bang. Could it be a Gentle
Birth, growth, dematerialisation, then
Rebirth. And could this theory be where
the two opposing hard cores (materialist
v immaterialist) meet, enabling man-
kind, even yet, to proceed safely to his
destiny.
If you read a short no*e from
Professor Kirby in “New Scientist,”
May 11, 1967, you might agree with
me. For, despite a little political and
religious shilly-shallying we could yet
live to see not only Professor Kitai-
gorodski and his side changing their
view of the world, but our side also
slightly changing theirs.
