A tinique ship, the "Bass Trader”. Operating between Melbourne and Northern Tasmania,
it is the first “Hft-on, lift-off”, “roll-on, roll-off” vessel to operate in Australian waters.
The first with a vehicle deck to take 40 semi-trailers to sea. And for quick turn-arounds,
the first with engines that can be replaced for overhaul. Napier "Deltic” and Rolls-Royce
diesels are fitted with fuel injectors made by C.A.V.
Ashore or afloat, in tractors or trading ships, C.A.V. diesel fuel injectors are wanted for
dependability and reliability in service.

The Vice-Chancellor of Monash Uni-

ies everywhere and it is about to be

Exit as a raven
people realised that Peter Lorre,
L who died last week aged 59, had
Australian connections: his youngest
irother and father settled here in the
1930 s when Lorre went to Hollywood,
md his father died here.
A friend of ours who recently visited
in Hollywood found him obese,
/ellow-eyed, and with crudely dyed
ilack hair a sad relic of the past. “I
vas the hottest thing on the Berlin stage,”
ie said forlornly, referring to his mem-
irable performances in “Danton’s
Death’ (as Saint-Juste), Wedekind’s
‘Spring Awakening” and
Brecht’s “A Man is a
Man", in his theatrical
leyday between 1927 and
1932.
Lorre’s performance as
the insane child murderer
in Fritz Lang’s “M”
1931) made him world-famous. He fled
Hitler to Vienna, Paris and England,
vhere he made two films for Hitchcock.
In Hollywood he was an excellent Ras-
kolnikov in Von Sternberg’s “Crime and
Punishment”, brilliantly played the
vicious and effeminate criminal Joel
Cairo in Huston’s “The Maltese Falcon”,
and was admirable as Ugate in “Casa-
blanca”.
In recent years he directed a film in
Germany, “The Lost One”, about a
sergeant caught up in East-West ten-
sions who becomes a murderer. Lorre’s
widow has insisted on this film being
vC Pt under lock and key, and it has not
:>een shown in Australia.
Before his death, Lorre appeared in
ilms as a pathetic minor clown. His final
legradation was to play a 200-lb raven
n a film of Poe's famous poem, shown
'ecently in Sydney.
Branch Office
Television rarely has exercised a
profound influence on this country,
Hit unquestionably one programme has
>ome power in the suburbs. We were
ooking through a suburban newspaper
from Mt Waverley in Melbourne last
week and came across this advertisement:
“All garden rubbish removed (VERY
CHEAP). Special rates for pensioners,
widows, ex-Servicemen. Phone STEP-
TOE & SON.”
Naturally we phoned Steptoe & Son
at once. No, they had no Steptoe & Son
in the family. The name was W. Mc-
Kenzie. Mrs McKenzie said: “We wanted
the name because we liked it. It was two
months ago that we asked and when we
found nobody else had it we snapped it
up at once. It gets people in. They look
up the ads, you know, see Steptoe &
Son, and they always pick us. Oh, yes,
Steptoe & Son has been a marvellous
help to business.”
Fats of Life
Since Ure Smith published it in 1961,
Dr H. M. Whyte’s book “The Fats
of Life” has earned well over a thous-
and pounds for the National Heart
Foundation of Australia, to which the
author gives his royalties. Dr Whyte, the
director of research at the Kanematsu
Institute, Sydney Hospital, is one who
associates coronary disease with dietary
fat, and he argues a persuasive case
for cutting down on satur-
ated fats (the dairy and
meat group) and substitut-
ing unsaturated fats (those
of vegetable oils and fish).
The Heart Foundation
will get a further boost
from “The Fats of Life”
when it goes into its first paperback
edition this month. This time, by
arrangement with the publishers, the
book will be distributed exclusively by
Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd, of
Sydney, makers of the unsaturated mar-
garine known as Miracle. After four
years of development this margarine was
launched last December backed by big
advertising.
Marrickville is a controversial com-
pany. In the New South Wales Parlia-
ment the voice of butter has been heard
many times suggesting that it exceeds
the quota of margarine production
assigned to it by the Government, and
more recently the possible health bene-
fits that it claims for Miracle have been
put under investigation at the direction
of the Minister for Health. The new
margarine, which has a high degree of
unsaturation, should come out well from
this inquiry.

not new, but this month it has been
given fresh impetus by ex-servicemen
themselves. The country’s two biggest
Returned Services associations, Auck-
land and Wellington, in polls instigated
by the parent body, the NZRSA, have
voted in favor of change.
The Anzac Day Act of 1920 provided
for observance as a public holiday, but
in 1922 it was amended to read “in all
respects as a Sunday”. For more than
40 years the civic memorial parades
and church services have been the only
public gatherings, cinemas and hotels
have remained strictly shut, and only
occasional charity concerts or films have
been allowed in the evening.
Only Parliament can change it, but
the pressure is growing.
Three years ago, in a public opinion
poll conducted for the “Auckland Star”,
48 per cent of the adult population
favored a pattern of closed holiday in
the morning with “sports, pictures, pubs
and recreation” in the afternoon. Only
32 per cent wanted to keep the present
Sunday pattern.
Crack-down oil hotels
ThiE Chairman of the State Licensing
Court, Col. A. P. Crisp, has served
notice on Tasmanian hotelkeepers that
the selling of a meal “ticket” or the
presence of a couple of potato crisps
on the table will not qualify them to
serve liquor on Sundays.
Amendments to the Licensing Act
passed last year by Parliament aimed at
removing the grave abuses of the “meal
permit” system. As might have been
expected, the introduction of this sys-
tem of permitting liquor sales to a per-
son having a meal in a hotel on Sunday
opened the door to almost an open go.
The purchase of a meal “ticket”,
which might be given free by the publi-
can, in itself came to be regarded as
establishing the bona fides of the patron,
who could then drink to his heart’s
content.
More scrupulous hotelkeepers served
dry biscuits to diners. Some, of course,
served meals, but in all probability they
had fewer customers than the publicans
who were frankly making a farce of the
law.
Sitting for the first time since his re-
appointment, Col. Crisp said that the
Court in future would scrutinise all
applications for meal permits and would
refuse applicants who could not satisfy
the Court that a permit was warranted.
Permits in future would apply only
to dining rooms, Col. Crisp added. They
would not extend as in the past to ad-
joining lounges. And licensees would
be expected to police their premises and
staffs to see that the system was not
abused.
Col. Crisp, who has dedicated himself
to the improvement of the residential
standards of Tasmanian hotels with
notable success had another warn-
ing for licensees. He said that he be-
lieved hotels should strive to extend the
tourist season, and the Court would
insist on adequate heating of bedrooms
in winter so that visitors would be coir,
fortable at any time of the year.
Tents and Caravans
/Damping Reserve: a name ambiguous
where every creature is contiguous,
in public view, with not one fence,
big welcome signs and LADIES;
GENTS.
All these caravans get depressing
watching total strangers dressing.
A family place with lots of kiddies
and someone always in the diddies.
You sit for hours peeling veges:
(wither’d from the lake the sedge is).
Air a-tremble with transistors,
feet all hung about with blisters.
Tents are sordid things to live in:
claustrophobic, crabbed and shrivin.
A tented girl may quaking wake
when tented men their tents mistake.
The thing that really baffles me:
you almost never see the sea.
Busy while the whole world roisters
making camp and opening oysters.
Like Arabs I my tent have folded,
sand-flied, mosquitoed, alcoholded.
Getting there is half the fun
it’s maybe when you sea the sun.
The other half is getting back:
quivering, alone, demoniac.

The Attorney-General v. the Philosopher
[The following is the transcript of the ABC-TV “Four Corners” debate on “The Group”.}
Chairman (Frank Bennett): Mr
Rylah, how did this so-called ban on
“The Group’’ come about? Who or
what began the move to declare the
book unfit in your State?
Mr Rylah (Attorney-General, Vic-
toria): Quite simply, the Police re-
ceived a number of complaints. They
told the Customs officer handling the
matter in Victoria they had received
a number of complaints, and they
were worried about the book. No more
than that. And the Customs officer
got in touch with the Under-Secretary
a couple of days later and said he
understood that if the sergeant in
charge of the Vice Squad saw Hutch-
inson’s, it would be withdrawn from
sale. I believe that’s exactly what
happened.
Chairman: But who informed the
Police in the first place?
Mr Rylah: I don't know. The Police
don’t disclose their source of infor-
mation. I didn't. \ received a couple
of complaints myself, and I’d read the
book as a result.
Chairman: And you don’t approve
of the book yourself?
Mr Rylah: I don’t like it much in
the hands of children, teenagers. I
don't think it's a very attractive book
in any way.
Professor Monro (Professor of
Philosophy, Monash University): It
must be kept out of the hands of
everybody, because you don’t like it in
the hands of teenagers?
Mr Rylah: Look, Professor, don’t
tell me what I like to do. The law of
the State of Victoria, which was
passed in 1954, provides for certain
things. My duty is not to say whether
the law is right or whether it is wrong.
My duty is to administer fearlessly as
the Minister of the Crown responsible
for this type of thing.
Professor Monro: Or to amend it?
Mr Rylah: That’s right. But there’s
never been any suggestion that it
should be amended, except for a sug-
gestion at the time it was introduced,
in 1954, that there should be a Cen-
sorship Board.
Professor Monro: You wouldn't
say, then, you are quite unaware that
there is a good deal of discontent
among writers, academics, intellectuals
generally about the whole state of
censorship in Australia?
Mr Rylah: I know that. That's ex-
pressed from time to time. But of
course the alternative to censorship,
Freedom to Read, is the free intro-
duction into this State of the type of


pornographic literature that’s flooding
London and flooding America.
Professor Monro: Of which Mary
McCarthy is an example?
Mr Rylah: Fm not discussing the
question whether Mary McCarthy is
an example or whether she isn’t. What
Fm saying is, freedom from censor-
ship means freedom for filth.
Professor Monro: Yes, but under
the cloak of keeping out filth, which
makes one immediately think of the
worst type of horror comic, under
the cloak of that you then proceed—
I mean the law then proceeds —to
prevent us from reading the works of
thoroughly reputable writers like
Mary McCarthy, who nobody surely
could regard as a purveyor of porno-
graphy.
Mr Rylah: Well, wait a minute.
Professor Monro: Or do you regard
her as such?
Mr Rylah: The law has not yet
made any decision on this book, and
the Courts make the decision in Vic-
toria, not the Government, not a
Censorship Board.
Professor Monro: Well, yes, but
your procedure, I understand, is that
where the Police think the book may
be obscene, they think it only fair to
warn booksellers and give them the
chance of withdrawing the book from
sale.
Mr Rylah: Well, the booksellers
ask that?
Professor Monro.: Yes, well this is
all right from the point of view of the
booksellers. But, of course, you
realise, don’t you, that it has un-
fortunate effects on the general public.
This is a general defect, I suppose,
in the legal system that the law can’t
decide on the matter that ought to be
decided, unless some individual is
prepared to fight the case. Now' this
is a matter of public interest. It’s a
matter of vital concern whether we
can read people like Mary McCarthy,
and the booksellers and the Police
between them can in effect prevent
the matter from ever being tested in
the Court. Now, Fm not blaming any-
body for this, but wouldn’t you agree
that this is a defect in the system
that it’s for Courts to decide, but that
in fact they may never get a chance
to decide?
Mr Rylah: You’re just citing one
individual case. This is the only case
I can think of where any book has
been withdrawn voluntarily.
Professor Monro: Oh, well, the
booksellers you say asked for it.
Mr Rylah: Well, the booksellers
ask for this type of arrangement.
Professor Monro: But it hasn't hap-
pened before?
Mr Rylah: It hasn't happened be-
fore with regard to a book.
Professor Monro: I see.
Mr Rylah: There are some pretty
doubtful magazines that have been
withdrawn under these circumstances,
and I don’t think you or Mr Bennett,
or I, have suffered because they
weren’t available to us.
Professor Monro: Well, possibly
not.
Mr Rylah: There was a case with
another book in Victoria, and Fm not
going to mention its name, where a
prosecution took place of a book-
seller. The bookseller was most upset
and said to the Police: ‘'Why didn’t
you go to the distributor?” and as a
result of the prosecution I believe the
distributor withdrew the book. It
wasn't a very nice book, but I think
probably you would put it in the same
category as this one.
Professor Monro: Well, perhaps I
would now. Well, let's see what cate-
gory this one is to be put in. The Act
says, I think, that an obscene book is
one that has a tendency to deprave
and corrupt those whose minds are
open to such influences. What would
you regard, or could you tell me what
the law regards, because I find this a
puzzling concept, as depravity and
corruption? When is somebody de-
praved?
Mr Rylah: I'm sorry, Fm not pre-
pared to express any views on that.
It’s a matter for the Courts. I haven’t
got the judgments at my fingertips.
Professor Monro: Well, what sort
of effect do you think? You read “The
Group”. You said you wouldn’t like
it to be in the hands of a teenage son
or daughter—why?
Mr Rylah: This is my personal
view, and don’t forget under the law
of Victoria, South Australia, probably
every other State, that this test, the
hands into which it’s likely to fall,
is an addition to what operates under
the Customs provision.
Professor Monro: Yes, but what
sort of harm, what sort of harm are
you afraid of? This is what puzzles
me.
Mr Rylah: I don’t like to see teen-
agers being educated in forms of
sexual perversion.
Professor Monro: Now, “educated
in forms of sexual perversion”. Told
that forms of sexual perversion exist?
Mr Rylah: Oh, and described very
adequately . . .
Professor Monro: Hang on, you say
“perversion”. Now what perversion
is in Mary McCarthy’s novel . . .?
Mr Rylah: Fm not going to adver-
tise that on TV.
Professor Monro: Well . . . well . . .
Mr Rylah: Look, you read it, you’ll
find it.
Professor Monro: All right, I have.
Now, am I right in saying it was
chapter two that you objected to?
Mr Rylah: Oh, there are about five
different parts. I didn’t object, re-
member, but there were complaints
about them.
Professor Monro: You did read . ..
Mr Rylah: My objection was purely
a personal one. It was the sort of
book I’d rather not have in the hands
of my teenage son or daughter.
Professor Monro: What I’m trying
to get at is why ... I don’t seem to be
getting very far. Perhaps we could
clarify this if I say a little about what
I think Mary McCarthy is doing.
Now this book deals with a group of
graduates from an exclusive, socially
exclusive, women’s university college
Vassar College. These people
graduated in 1933 the date is im-
portant. It traces what happened to
them in the years immediately after
graduation. They are people who
have passed their formative years just
in the period when a generation that
got the first impact of the rise of
Freudian ideas of women's freedom,
of sexual freedom generally. And in,
at any rate, Chapter 2, which some-
body told me was the chapter objected
to, at any rate in that chapter, what
you have is, it seems to me, a very
skilful description of a girl brought
up in this atmosphere, very naive
really, with this rather romantic
attitude to sexual freedom, imagining
herself as bravely battling for her
rights, losing her virginity. . . .
Mr Rylah: In great detail . . .
Professor Monro: And well, this is
the point . . .
Mr Rylah: Described in detail. . . .
Professor Monro: Described in
detail for a very good reason. The
whole point. . . .
Mr Rylah: The very good reason to
sell the book. . .
Professor Monro: The whole point
of the chapter turns on the contrast
between this girl’s naivety, her
romantic attitude, and the rather
sordid physiological realities which
she finds herself confronted with when
she tries this on, when she sets out to
be a sexual pioneer, and strike a blow
for . . .
Mr Rylah: Do you really believe
that this book would have sold with-
out those passages of sex in it?
Professor Monro: This book would
not have sold without your very
effective publicity.
Chairman: Now, gentlemen, if I
may stop you there. . . .


THIS AUSTRALIA
EDUCATION
The Chamberlain
Document
Labor must oppose State Aid
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
F. E. CHAMBERLAIN
Knows where
TI/Ir F. E. (“Joe”) Chamberlain no
longer possesses the external trap-
pings of ALP Federal power. He has
ceased to be either Federal ALP presi-
dent or secretary. He is nowadays
nominally just a member of the Labor
Party's hierarchy. But he is still a force.
His boldness makes him that.
He does not shillyshally like
Calwell or shelter behind anonymity as
so many Caucus members have done. In
a report to his Western Australian
Executive, now being circulated and
studied closely by ALP members, he
laid the issue boldly and right on the line
for Calwell, Caucus and anyone else
interested in both how ALP policy
decisions are made and policed.
In my view the Chamberlain document
repays study. It not only shows the
workings of a machine-mind, it also
reveals that the Heffron State Labor
Government had yielded to machine
pressure on science blocks even before
the Federal Executive representatives
Messrs J. Keeffe (Qld), C. Wyndham
(Vic.) and Chamberlain marched on
NSW in, at that time, an unsuccessful
attempt to force the Heffron Govern-
ment to abandon its modified proposals
to assist parents with children at private
schools.
The relevant sections of the docu-
ment read: “It will be recalled that the
1963 Annual Conference of the Party in
NSW adopted the proposition which
permitted the Government to establish
science blocks in private schools. The
1963 Federal Conference of the Party,
however, in effect reaffirmed the policy
decision of the 1957 Conference, i.e.,
that no direct aid could be made to a
private school and aid was limited in an
indirect manner by making available
scholarships to the student irrespective
of the school the student attended.
“After certain Federal action had been
taken, the NSW Government agreed to
withdraw its proposals based upon the
Conference decision of the NSW State
branch. However, it subsequently intro-
duced another scheme which was sub-
mitted as being in keeping with Federal
policy but upon examination proved to
be a direct subsidy to the parents who
by their own choice sent their children
to private schools which called for the
payment of fees.
“The representatives of the Federal
Executive, when examining this position
in NSW, were confronted with the general
situation that aid of a similar character
had been granted by State Labor Govern-
ments or alternatively supported by State
Parliamentary Labor Parties in the
various States. This was particularly so
in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania.
“As a consequence the Federal Execu-
tive representatives reached the unani-
mous conclusion that although there had
been a breach of Party policy in NSW,
the State could not be isolated on this
question and that the Federal Executive
should review the matter in the light of
this fact. The Federal Executive
unanimously adopted the findings of its
committee, i.e., that there had been a
breach of policy in NSW but also that
the NSW Government had acted in'good
faith.
“The position before the Executive
was also further complicated by the fact
that the Menzies Government was cur-
rently placing before Parliament a
statement as to the manner in which its
election pledges would be implemented
in respect to providing £5 million for the
purpose of assisting State education
systems and the private school systems
in respect to the establishment of
facilities for the teaching of science.
“Policy-making is the prerogative of
the Federal Conference. The Federal
Executive does have power in respect to
interpretation of policy where policy
becomes challenged in some way. These
powers of interpretation were exercised
by the Federal Executive on this occasion
but only in respect to the NSW case.
“In respect to the Menzies Govern-
ment's proposals on State Aid, no inter-
pretation was required.
“The establishment by the Govern-
ment of science blocks and the provision
of science facilities in private schools is
quite obviously contrary to Federal Party
policy and therefore it should be noted
that in accordance with traditional Party
procedure the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party will automatically do all
within its powers to protect the policy
of the Party when it becomes affected
by any proposed legislation.”
It is no wonder that Chamberlain has
been the force he has been within the
Labor Party in the past decade. He at
least knows where he wants to go.
which is more than the current leader-
ship of the Parliamentary Labor Party
either know or seem to want to know.
THE ECONOMY
Grumbling at the Americans
“Washington is not playing cricket ”
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
HTaking on the unenviable role usually
A left to Mr J. McEwen (who is
overseas) the Federal Treasurer Mr H. E.
Holt took the United States to task on
two counts when addressing members of
the Melbourne Stock Exchange last week,
first that Australia is being victimised
by the virtual prohibition on bond issues
in the United States through its interest
equalisation tax and second that in try-
ing to stop the recent meat agreement
being implemented the meat lobby in
Washington is not playing cricket.
Using as a backdrop good humored
off-the-cuff references to the strength o!
the economy and the survival qualities
both of Federal treasurers and the stool
exchanges in face of such nasty govern'
ment strokes as the 1960 economic
restraining measures, Mr Holt gave tltf
impression of relishing the opportune
to project himself as top Governmo cl
spokesman, especially on the meat ques-
tion, which was rather off his
Treasury beat.
However, speaking from a prepared


(by -the Treasury, no doubt) statement
on the effect of the equalisation tax the
Treasurer appeared to do less than justice
to his counterpart in Washington and
seemed to be crying long before the
tax has made any serious difference to
our economic position either internal or
external.
ft is true, of course, that Wall Street
has become accustomed to our face
and before the tax we could reckon
on making two bond issues a year there
to bring in $25 to $3O million each
and it is also true that these yearly loans
have served a very useful purpose in
bolstering up our reserves as well as
the gold and dollar reserves of the sterl-
ing area.
But surely with our overseas reserves
standing at over £BOO million we can
afford to forgo making any dollar loans
in 1964 and should be quite happy to
do so to assist the United States in its
own mammoth task of correcting the
chronic imbalance in its overseas pay-
ments. There can be no question of the
Treasurer wanting any dollars to keep
his own overall loan targets when with
one internal loan still to go this financial
year he is as good as home on that
score.
Surely, too, in our flush monetary
condition both at home and abroad it
is even ungenerous to prod the United
States to relax the interest equalisation
tax, especially when under present legis-
lation the tax will not apply to borrow-
ings after December, 1965, and since it
is widely believed that the cut off in bond
issues will be eased well before then.
Therefore it will be time enough for
Mr Holt to grumble when we are in a
balance-of-payments predicament our-
selves or when the reduction in the US
payments deficit (which has made the
biggest contribution to international
liquidity in recent years) sets up strains
which threaten the expansion of world
trade.
Neither is the case at the moment.
Lurther, it is inconsistent of the
Treasurer to point the bone at the US
for its current overseas lending ban and
at the same time criticise it as having
had a huge favorable trade balance with
Australia since import restrictions were
lifted early in 1960.
The balance also reflects what the
Department of Trade hailed as a great
boon when trade with the dollar coun-
tries was liberalised.
Mr Holt's brand of thinking on the
meat agreement was also hard to follow
because in effect he was saying that
United States meat producers as well as
Congress should necessarily play second
fiddle to the Executive in deciding the
fate of the local industry. This shows a
poor appreciation of the ultimate depen-
dence of the Executive on Congress in
the US. Moreover if the US Government
went into negotiations with countries
exporting meat to the US without
recognising that too Liberal an agreement
would bring a storm of protest from local
producers that is its affair whether this
result is humiliating to it, as Mr Holt
suggests, or not.
CENSORSHIP
Hutchinson’s
Chicken Out
But an appeal to London
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
A. RYLAH
No guarantees
IVlethodically, in a mood of quiet
A determination, about 80 Melbourne
citizens met last week and formed them-
selves into a Freedom to Read Com-
mittee. Their meeting was sparked off
by the Bolte Government's ban on Mary
McCarthy’s “The Group”, but the com-
mittee intends to concern itself not only
with this particular ban, but with the
question of Australian literary censorship
in general. “Conscious of the fact
that censorship affects all Austra-
bans, and not just Victorians, this
association would welcome the for-
mation of similar associations in
all States to investigate both State and
Commonwealth censorships”, was one of
the motions carried,
The committee elected Professor
Hector Monro, of Monash University,
President of its Executive. Publisher
Dr Andrew Fabyini and a Melbourne
University Professor of English, lan
Maxwell, were elected as Vice-Presidents,
Mr Newman Rosenthal, who had issued
the invitations to the meeting, was
appointed Treasurer, with Mr lan
Turner, a Senior History Lecturer at
Monash University, Secretary. Eight
Executive members were elected: Rt Rev.
Dr Felix Arnott, Anglican Coadjutor
Bishop of Melbourne; Professor R.
Andrew, Dean of Medicine at Monash;
Mr Colin Badger, Director of Victoria’s
Adult Education Movement; Mr Barry
Jones, who described himself as a school-
teacher; Mr J. Simkin, President of the
Public Libraries Section of the Victorian
Branch of the Australian Library As-
sociation; Mr Leonard Mann, well-
known novelist; Miss A. J. Winduss, also
prominent in the Libraries’ Association;
and Mr Peter Darby, Managing Director
of Robertson and Mullens, booksellers.
The committee launched a public ap-
peal for funds to carry out its aims and
instructed the Executive to arrange a
large public meeting at which members
of the association would be enrolled.
The Executive was also asked to inves-
tigate the possibilities of drawing up
a censorship code which would “best
safeguard the interest of the com-
munity”, but as an immediate matter to
examine ways whereby restrictions on
‘‘The Group” could be removed.
It also placed on record its apprecia-
tion of the part played by the Austra-
lian Press, radio and TV services “in
directing the attention of the community
to the potential dangers if the present
situation is allowed to continue.”
The next day the local distributors of
“The Group”, Hutchinson and Company
Ltd, announced they had abandoned
plans to start a test case over the novel.
A spokesman said they had been unable
to get an assurance from the Victorian
Government that they could run a test
case without involving one or more of
their employees in the risk of a gaol
sentence. Under Victorian law there
are at least two avenues through which
an obscenity prosecution could be
launched. One of these would involve
the matter of a Court order for the
destruction of the works concerned,
if proved obscene. The other could
result in the defendants being gaoled.
Mr A. Rylah was not prepared to
guarantee that a case of the latter type
would result if Hutchinson’s took, steps
to get “The Group” into the courts.
Hutchinson’s statement said that while
anxious to have the matter tested in
Court and while believing an important
principle was involved, they were not
prepared to have their staff and others
take the risk of “being indicted and tried
like common criminals before a judge
and jury”. It recalled the gaol sentence
imposed on author Robert Close in the
“Love Me, Sailor” case in Melbourne.
The Lreedom to Read Committee,
while temporarily dismayed, took swift
action in the new situation. Professor
Monro cabled the novel’s publishers,
Weidenfeld and Nicolson of London,
asking if they would provide finance,
supplementary to that obtained by public
appeal, to fight a test case.


POLITICS
Mr Stoneham Goes Hiking
The coming Victorian election
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
CLIVE STONEHAM
Homespun
Clive Phillip Stoneham, the 54-year-
old leader of the Victorian Parlia-
mentary Labor Party, still lists hiking as
his number one hobby. Lately he has
been trying to put his predilection for
the wide open spaces to political use in
touring the Victorian countryside. Mr
Stoneham, a country member himself
and in the past Minister for Agriculture,
Water Supply, State Development and
Decentralisation, speaks the kind of
language that country people like to
hear.
Mr Stoneham's tripping around the
countryside under the title of “Meet The
People” tours has, of course, not been
hiking as a hobby but as shrewd political
tactics directed towards the State elec-
tions scheduled for June 27.
Mr Stoneham was born in the old
mid-Victorian mining town of Mary-
borough and still lives there as its mem-
ber. A politician of the home-spun
kind, Mr Stoneham is a world removed
from the savage Unity Ticket-Trades
Hall world of Lygon Street, which has
dominated Victorian ALP politics since
the last Labor Government fell in the
split.
Even allowing for that happy fact,
the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria
is far from being a silent man. In NSW
Opposition politicians have often debated
the pros and cons of whether an Opposi-
tion Leader can saturate the public with
too many statements. There can be no
doubt whose side Mr Stoneham would
be on in that argument. He will make
a statement on anything.
Hope springs eternal in the party-
worker's breast and so soon after the
Federal debacle of November 30 there
are people in Melbourne talking optim-
istically about Labor’s prospects in the
Victorian June elections. They take
sustenance from the fact that the State
situation is markedly different from the
Federal one in party line-ups, with a
virtual pact between the Country Party
and the ALP.
The link has been forged in the Upper
House where the Bolte Government has
a minority of one.
There is a precedent from the jungle
world of Victorian State politics before
the Labor split for Labor-Country Party
co-operation in government. If an
electoral pact was worked out, leading
to the prospect of a Labor-CP Govern-
ment alliance, the combined Labor and
Country Party forces would have to take
seven seats from Mr Bolte before they
could think of forming a government.
Labor optimism is based on hopes for
a swing of at least two per cent from
the Government and some drift of DLP
votes back to Labor. The DLP vote in
the Federal elections showed a drop of
nearly three per cent in Victoria (from
15.1 per cent to 12.3 per cent) but fig-
ures indicate that rather than going to
Labor these drifters went to swell the
Liberal vote.
An electoral pact and an anti-Gov-
ernment swing could give the Country
Party, so it is said, two seats in the
North-West Kara Kara and Lowan. It
is no coincidence that Mr Stoneham
went into the western districts because
the ALP has its eye on Dundas, a seat
which with a swing and Country Party
preferences could perhaps go to the
ALP.
Another seat, Morwell, which has the
brown coalfields, is seen as a Labor
hope with a swing of only 300 votes
needed to unseat the Liberal member.
Geelong West had a Government
majority of 103 last time and home
development and a good candidate (the
perennial League footballer) give Labor
a good chance.
Some hopes are held for Evelyn on
the north-eastern outskirts of Melbourne.
Oakleigh. once a Labor seat, is another
suburban hope, but the odds are longer.
In the more inner city seat of Prahran
one-time slow bowler Sam Loxton faces
a challenge from R. Pettiona, for Labor.
But it is obvious that even if the
Country Party pact is arranged and has
the desired results in the rural seats, the
election would still have to be won in
the city, and all the Labor hopes there
require a substantial swing. Mr Stone-
ham's country hiking is useful but he
will still have to win in Melbourne.
BUSHRANGERS AND JOURNALISTS
ffijfculLetCn
80 Years Ago: April 5, 1884
Power, the bushranger, is about to
be released from Pentridge. A
philanthropic lady has offered to take
care of him for the rest of his life.
Nearly as good to be a bushranger
as to be a parson. We wonder now
if he were an old journalist, worn
out in serving the cause of Freedom
and Enlightenment, and were to call
on that philanthropic lady and ask
her fo take care of him, what she
would do? Have him bound to the
meat-safe while they were going for
the constable, of course. With regard
to Power, though, we think it should
not have been left to individual
generosity to provide for him in his
old age. Surely the Government
could have given him a poor JP-ship
at least! Of course, not every dis-
charged criminal can expect a Speak-
ership.
At a recent meeting of the Vic-
torian Bar, it was decided that
a ‘"black list” should be kept of the
names of attorneys who are in the
habit of neglecting to pay fees due
to counsel, and that each honourable
member of the Bar should refuse to
take business from such practition-
ers. We didn't know that our sister
colony was afflicted with any such
evil. Certainly, there are plenty of
attorneys in New South Wales who
know how to hold on to all the
money that comes their way, but we
had a better opinion of the Victorian
Bar.
Judge Innes says that it makes his
heart bleed to hear of the de-
pravity of the colony. So it does
ours. If we had less depravity, we
might have no Judge Innes.

cently Kelberg started Supreme Court
proceedings, claiming that a Council de-
cision to fluoridate the city’s water went
beyond the Sale Council's powers under
section 690 of the Local Government
Act. He also challenged a by-law which
the Council had passed under another
section of the Act relating to health.
Last week Mr Justice Gillard upheld
Mr Kelberg on both points and granted
an injunction restraining the Council
from proceeding with its plans to fluori-
date. The Judge said that section 690
concerned the powers of Local Govern-
ments to provide water supply. There
was power to add substances, but only
to make the water supply purer. From
the evidence, Mr Justice Gillard said he
believed fluoride had no purifying effect,
even though its effects on dental health
were beneficial.
The Judge said he accepted evidence
showing that children who had spent all
their lives in areas with fluoridated water
showed 60 per cent less than normal
dental decay. However, he said, he did
not consider he needed to rule on
whether or not introduction of fluoride
to water supplies was good or bad for
the community. He also upheld Mr Kel-
berg's second challenge. He said the by-
law which Sale Council had passed under
the health provisions of another section
of the Local Government Act was too
wide in its terms.
Sale Council will consider the situ-
ation on April 6. It may decide to re-
draft the by-law framed under the health
regulations of the Act, or approach the
State Government to have the Act itself
amended. The Minister for Local Gov-
ernment, Mr. Porter, has indicated that
an application from Sale for an amend-
ment to the Water Act would be con-
sidered. However, with State elections in
June, the Government is most unlikely
to help Sale or any other fluoride-
minded municipalities before the poll.
The issue is a political unknown into
which the Bolte Government does not
wish to steer itself. There has already
been controversy on the Metropolitan
Water Board, which recently deferred for
six weeks a motion to endorse fluoride
in principle. The motion came from Mr
J. J. Ginifer, an ALP Councillor from
Altona Shire, but it met solid opposi-
tion from Mr A. R. Roberts of Brighton,
who attacked fluoridation as an in-
fringement of the rights of the indi-
vidual.
The secretary of the Victorian Branch
of the Australian Dental Association,
Mr A. L. Proud, said the decision point-
ed to the need for State action to tidy
up the legal position.
The decision leaves Bacchus Marsh as
the only Victorian centre with fluori-
dated water.
CITY DEVELOPMENT - I
The New Melbourne
A bash at, the tenpins
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
C. R. NATHAN
Planning
Tt could be that the decline in shops
in Melbourne's inner city a
threatening sign only three years ago—
has been checked. Whether this is per-
manent is uncertain; but then so is the
fate of the entire city area as a shop-
ping district.
Lord Mayor Nathan’s City Council, in
1961, put through a planning order giving
it powers to ensure that existing shops are
retained in new developments. This
was the result of a first class row which
developed when the State Savings Bank
of Victoria extended its headquarters in
Elizabeth Street and kicked out nine
tenants. The bank resisted all pressure
from the Council and city retailers to
change its mind.
Not that the Council can always be
relied on to take a stand for shops
against other interests. As one example,
it has approved the Qantas purchase of
Albany Court, in the busy part of Col-
lins Street, although Qantas will close
an arcade of about 20 shops, and use
the present newsreel theatrette in the
building for itself.
Any Keep-The-Shops policy, of
course, has a better chance of success
in a city like Melbourne than in Syd-
ney. Melbourne's inner city retail area
is heavily concentrated in half a dozen
blocks. The major part of it is packed
along or between the parallels of Flin-
ders, Collins and Bourke, and between
the parallels at right-angles to these —-
Elizabeth, Swanston and Russell with
various offshoots from this zone. As a
result, it is possible to put up many
major buildings in Melbourne—in, say,
the commercial or west end of Collins
and Bourke without replacing much
in the way of shops at all. Another
factor in Melbourne is that the inner
city had for many years one or two
dead-beat areas like the ancient East-
ern Market site in Exhibition Street, and
the Western Market, in Collins Street.
The Southern Cross Hotel, now on the
old Eastern Market spot, has a central
plaza and some 60 new shops, and a
tenpin bowling alley.
Melbourne has lost color. No doubt
about that. The old market, with its
wine cellars, second-hand bookstalls,
foreign groceries, butchers, violin-
mender, hardware store and other
tenants had something. But, put pureh
in point of numbers of shops, and in the
range of goods and services offering to
the public, the site has gained. On the
site of the old Western Market, the
part-completed National Mutual sky-
scraper will have a plaza and a shop-
ping arcade at street level. The old
market had nothing, and was an eye-
sore.
The project that Sir lan Potter’s Aus-
tralian United Corporation, Prudential
Assurance and Email have under way
now to link Elizabeth and Collins
Streets through a new building in each
of these two streets also includes a
new 23-shop arcade while displacing
virtually nothing.
The Prince's Gate project, to roof
1 i acres of the Flinders Street railway
yards, between Swanston and Russell
Streets, and erect two 15 to 20 storey
buildings, also includes a public plaza
and many more new shops than the
few in the railways building.
The new Colonial Mutual Life build-
ing. at the corner of Collins and Eliza-
beth Streets, has more new ground-
level shops than it destroyed.
Other buildings have risen in Mel-
bourne without much damage to shop-
ping as such. The Conzinc skyscraper
in Collins Street, between Russell and
Exhibition Streets, has no shops, but
displaced only a couple when the old
Melbourne Mansions was demolished.
Melbourne has lost some of its big
stores in the continuing decline of the
city as a retail centre. Hicks, Atkinson,
Paynes, and the Mutual have died. But
even this has not been all loss again,
so far as numbers are concerned. The
Mutual in Flinders Street, for example,
now has a big arcade of small shops,
as well as the city's second tenpin alley.
Balancing gains against losses, it I s
said that Melbourne has achieved 150
additional shops of all kinds since a
Commonwealth Statistician's report last
year showing a decline of 196 in five
years. All would be reasonably well, if
numbers were the whole -story. But


the destruction of old buildings and the
creation of new fronts and arcades has
changed the balance of the city’s facili-
ties.
Working at the east end of the city,
you can no longer slip up to the old
Eastern Market hardware shop. You
must go to Bourke Street, or down to
Elizabeth Street or beyond. Lunch-
time browsing among the second-hand
books of the Market or at the top end
of Bourke Street is not possible now.
On the other hand, a defender of the
new-style Melbourne could say he
is free to enjoy a lunch-time bash at the
tenpins.
CITY DEVELOPMENT - II
Logan’s Quiet Diplomacy
The De Leuw Cather report
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
L. LOGAN
No whips
of Perth people each week
-*• have been filing past a futuristic-
looking model of a road system that is
to ring Perth with freeways taking
19 acres of the precious Swan River
for the first section and at the same
time West Australia’s Cabinet is con-
sidering a recommendation that Perth’s
railway line be dropped underground
for several blocks through the heart of
the city.
The study before Cabinet is a report
by Chicago consulting engineers De Leuw
Cather and Co., put forward last Octo-
ber, and backed since then with supple-
mentary detail by several government
departments.
De Leuw Cather started out to help
the Government work on its road links,
based on the original 1954 recommen-
dations by Professor Gordon Stephen-
son. They soon found that the city
limited as it is by the river and the rail-
way line —was too cramped for the type
of fast-moving traffic their road curves
were to cater for. So they moved into
the problem of whether or not the rail-
way should be sunk.
They have recommended that the line
drop completely below ground level.
The implications of this and associated
ideas will change Perth dramatically.
The first impact will be on a run-
down area now “on the wrong side of
the track ’. With the physical boundary
of the railway out of sight, the city will
extend its influence and prestige into
this area. And already planners are
working on ideas for a split-level city
along the lines laid out in Britain’s
Buchanan Report late last year . . .
one level for pedestrians, the other for
cars.
Along with the two-level idea, the
sketch pads and the planners’ far-out
minds are busy with schemes for one-
way streets, pedestrian malls, and the
establishment of a new focal hub
around the outlet of the rapid-transit
rail system and the neighboring cultural
centre.
These planners, thinking ahead to the
year 2000 when there will be twice as
many cars and three times as many
people in Perth as there are today, see
themselves as pacemakers with a unique
opportunity.
Their great frustration is the lack of
support from local government author-
ities, particularly Perth City Council,
which stands to benefit most from their
foresight.
Responsibility for the overall scheme
rests with the Metropolitan Region
Authority, made up of local government
representatives and advisers from five
State departments. The Minister in
charge is Country Party man Les Logan
who holds the portfolios of Local
Government, Town Planning, and Child
Welfare, and who usually allows town
planning matters to be put before the
public by his more urban colleagues
or officers.
Town Planning people value his quiet
diplomacy, used last year in getting
through the big, complicated and poten-
tially controversial legislation which ap-
proved their schemes. But at the same
time they miss the kind of drive at the
top that could whip up local govern-
ment enthusiasm and support.
CITY DEVELOPMENT - III
Protecting
Property-Owners
The right of appeal
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
H. RICHTER
A curb
A curb on the powerful Brisbane City
Council and the omnipotent Great-
er Brisbane Town Planning Committee,
on which the Council has three of the
five representatives, is contained in
Town Plan legislation introduced in
State Parliament recently by Local
Government Minister Harold Richter.
The legislation, to implement the plan,
provides safeguards against the indefi-
nite freezing of property as a result of
Town Plan factors. Mr Richter told
Parliament that a person whose land was
injuriously affected by the plan now
had no right to compensation, and in
fact the Council would have no power
in law to pay him compensation if it
wished to do so.
The Town Plan Bill will enable a
District Court judge to hear and deter-
mine compensation claims. People
dissatisfied with the way in which their
land is zoned under the plan now have
no right of appeal against the zoning,
but the Bill will give them the right.
The Bill also says that the Council must
within 40 days decide whether it will
reject or approve applications to sub-
divide land or to put buildings on land.
Some applicants have complained about
long delays. The Greater Brisbane
Town Planning Committee, formed to
prepare the plan, and headed by the
ALP Lord Mayor (Alderman Jones)
will disappear. But under the proposed
legislation, the Council can by ordinance
appoint an “advisory committee”, to
advise the Council “on exercising its
power and authority under the plan”.
Some Labor aldermen have been hoping
for some time that Alderman Jones’s
power would be reduced by the elimi-
nation of the original committee, but
it is unlikely that he, a planning fana-
tic, would view with pleasure any move
to leave him out of the new committee.

SYDNEY 2000 AD
Six million people and more uncomfortable than ever?
By GEORGE CLARKE
What will it be like to live in Syd-
ney or Melbourne by 1988 or
by the year 2000? This is de-
veloping into one of the biggest policy
issues in the nation, which will affect
intimately, in all the details of everyday
life, an increasing majority of Austra-
lians.
There are only 24 more years before
Sydney’s 200th anniversary. There are
only 35 whole years left in the second
millennium AD. A majority of today’s
Australians can expect to live through
both of these birthdays, because about
half of us are still under age 30. Deci-
sions taken over the next decade will
increasingly shape and reshape our
metropolitan lives, or at least the lives
of our metropolitan children. Most of
these most basic decisions will of course
be made by people already over 30, who
are currently in positions of unwitting
influence and indirect control.
On March 9 this year, the direct
responsibility for shaping overall State
patterns of settlement and Sydney’s
metropolitian form has passed to the 12
members of the newly established NSW
State Planning Authority, under the
chairmanship of the town planner, Mr
Nigel Ashton. The youngest member
of the new Authority, still in his thir-
ties, is Associate Professor John H.
Shaw, the nominee of the Sydney Divi-
sion of the Australian Planning Insti-
tute.
The new Authority has been charged
with the tasks of co-ordinating plans for
the use and development of all land in
the State, and particularly with the job
of co-ordinating public and private land
uses with the provision of utility ser-
vices, transport facilities and other
essential requirements for urban and
non-urban land development. The
Authority is itself a Constructing Author-
ity, under the terms of the Public Works
Act, and has powers to raise loans, to
acquire and to develop land.
The biggest, and simplest, single issue
that the Authority faces is the one posed
in my opening question: what will it be
like to live, -travel, work, play and raise
a family in or near Sydney in 25 years’
time?
How many people?
Tt seems highly likely that total world
population will more than double
in the next 35 years. Australia should
keep pace, by more than doubling
national population to 24.6 million. This
is a recent and serious projection of
Australian population to the year 2000,
based on a continuance of recent demo-
graphic factors and immigration rates.
The 1961 Census has confirmed that
more and more Australians are moving
to the metropolitan areas, where 56 per
cent of us now live. The rural popu-
lation is the lowest in our history.
If these percentages hold, then Syd-
ney and Melbourne themselves will
double or treble in population within
the lifetime of most of us. Herein lies
the challenge and the opportunity for
us to plan and build almost as much in
the next, say, 25 years as we have over
the past 175 years.
Sydney is becoming a regional cluster
of cities, reaching out to embrace the
foothills of the Blue Mountains,
squeezing up and down the coastal
plains past Newcastle and Wollongong.
This region now contains about 2.6
million people, but is projected to con-
tain 4.9 million people by 1988 and 6.1
million by the year 2000. The Mel-
bourne-Geelong-Westernport cluster now
holds a mere 2.1 million, but is heading
for 4.0 million by 1988, and 4.9 mil-
lion by the year 2000. These figures,
for what they are worth, were presented
by Professor W. D. Borrie at a recent
conference on “The Metropolis in Aus-
tralia” held at the ANU in Canberra by
the Social Science Research Council.
Many people still hope that this scale
of growth around Melbourne and Syd-
ney can be avoided by massive “decen-
tralisation”. But no matter what we do
about expanding smaller cities and
towns, we will still have to plan for
greatly increased growth in our two
major conurbations.

SELECTIVE VIEWING AND LISTENING
Our man with Sukarno In Djakarta, President Sukarno
addresses a rally; in Manila, he makes a statement; in West Irian, he meets local leaders. In
each of these places he has made news. And wherever he goes, an ABC newsman is there ...
as surely as his shadow. This degree of application is typical of ABC newsgathering. From
offices in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Djakarta, an elaborate net is laid across
all possible Asian news-centres. In Laos and Vietnam, the ABC reported from the heart of
the civil wars; from Malaysia, along the mountainous borders of Borneo or from Singapore's
teeming streets, ABC reporters on the spot brought you details of the new nation’s birth.
From London and New York the ABC nets the rest of the world similarly (in close association
with Reuters and UPI). And partnership in the British Commonwealth International News-
film Agency assures immediate availability of the world’s important newsfilm. At home, 200
ABC reporters and cameramen are supported by hundreds of local correspondents, so that the
ABC is always where news breaks. Logical then that the informed Australian seeks his news
from the ABC. Selective viewing and listening need not apply only to entertainment. You’ll
find you get to the heart of the news,
through the ABC.

metropolitan Canberras, each taking, as
Canberra does, about 7000 persons per
annum! And if we did in fact mount
such a massive national new-city effort,
the task would surely create thousands
of new jobs in both Sydney and Mel-
bourne, thereby giving us faster overall
national economic growth, but leaving
us still to solve the problems of metro-
politan expansion.
Faster and more balanced national
growth could well justify a national
programme for new and expanded ex-
metropolitan cities, as is now commonly
advocated by city and regional planners,
economists, geographers and some poli-
ticians. Gladstone, Grafton, Wodonga,
Townsville, Tamworth and Portland
have been mentioned in this context.
By concentrating investment at a few
such growth points, we could give our-
selves a range of new inland and port
cities of up to a quarter of a million
each. I believe that we not only could,
but should, wherever a sound economic
base can be found and exploited.
I also trust that we will see the steady
continued growth of Brisbane, Adelaide,
Perth and Hobart, together with more
such special-purpose new towns as
Elizabeth, Hazelwood and Coleambally.
Projects in such places as the Snowy
and the Ord and the Latrobe Valley may
well increasingly generate minor urban
centres. Mining development will con-
tinue to build up places like Mt Isa,
which anticipates population growth of
more than 50 per cent over the next
five years.
But even if all these things happen,
they will not significantly restrain the
continued expansion of Sydney and
Melbourne. Whatever other city-building
we may do, we cannot for much longer
avoid the issues of how to cope with
megalopolis as well.
Learning the hard way
Sydney as a whole can no longer be
adequately described as a metro-
polis or mother-city. That term can now
only illuminate the functions of the
original core city on the central shores
of Sydney Harbor. The whole regional
unit is now in a state of violent struc-
tural change, from a single-centred
urban mass to a many-centred cluster
of cities or city-districts. The new unit
may be called “megalopolis”, or “the
regional city”.
The evolution from one form to
another is perhaps proving slower and
more painful than it might otherwise
have been, because we were caught both
sentimentally and intellectually unpre-
pared by the first big surge of post-war
growth. Planners now agree that this
growth surge must be frankly accepted
as continuous, perhaps even infinitely
so. Dr C. A. Doxiadis, the Athenian
Ekistician, goes so far as to predict
EcumenopoUs, the Jinking up of regional
clusters or networks of cities so as to
cover whole continents.
Planners also now agree that the
general direction of the basic structural
evolution must be accepted, and that
regional development plans and pro-
grammes must attempt to refine, guide
and give clear physical expression to
spontaneous social and economic forces.
Their only problem is, then, to uncover
and anticipate, by research and intui-
tion, just what those “spontaneous”
forces are, and to decide how they
should be guided and expressed.
In 1945, the new professionals of
Sydney’s Cumberland County Council
had no proven British or American
experience in successful megalopolitan
planning to guide them. Over that Coun-
cil's life, from 1945 to 1964, they had
to educate themselves, and their public,
in the school of hard megalopolitan
knocks. The CCC is now about to
disappear as a political body and its
staff will be absorbed into the new State
Planning Authority. The Authority will
inherit all the benefits of an aroused
public awareness which the CCC
created, but it mercifully escapes the
odium of political failure which, how-
ever heroically, surrounds the CCC.
Members and staff of the Council, over
its 19 years of life, have in effect sacri-
ficed themselves on the beachhead of
megalopolitan planning in New South
Wales.
The CCC legacy
/"Officers of the CCC, first under Mr
Sidney Luker and then under Mr
Roderick Fraser, took upon themselves
the long and thankless task of making
the public aware that real problems of
public social and economic policy exist-
ed in the form and direction of urban
expansion. They have stimulated the
Press, politicians and the academics to
think and talk seriously about the eco-
nomics of suburban expansion, the high
social and private financial costs of
sprawl and scatteration, about the divi-
sion of costs for sewerage and water
reticulation in new areas, and about the
social, justice and economic sanity of
allowing the fortuitous owners of raw
fringe land reap the harvest of unearned
increments in land value.
They have also kept nagging away
about the disintegration of family and
social life largely brought about by the
physical conditions of low-density pre-
mature subdivision in the new slums on
Sydney’s far western fringe.
One of the Council’s yet unpublished
legacies will be a report by social
anthropologist Mrs Caroline Kelly, en-
titled “Social Aspects of Planning in the
New Suburbs”. This summarises a sur-

vey of six outer suburbs, involving inter-
views with 1,020 housewives, and with
a sample of tradespeople, doctors, bank
managers and teachers.
Perhaps the most ominous thing
seeming to emerge from this survey is
that our universal policy, of pushing
lower income families into mortgages
on detached houses in isolated and un-
serviced fringe settlements, is tending
to damage the very institution it w’as
meant to preserve that is, the social
orderliness of family and community life.
The most sacred item of our Federal
policies has been to build and sell the
absolute maximum of detached houses.
The quantity of houses built and the
percentage of them owner or mortgagee-
occupied have so far been the domin-
ant considerations. In consequence it'
can now be demonstrated that a scat-
tered collection of small houses does not
alone make a healthy or happy com-
munity. With infrequent bus services
which cease at 7.00 p.m. and do not
run at all on Sundays, without paved
roads, without sewerage or proper
drainage, without convenient shops or
work places, without meeting-halls,
nearby schools or sports and entertain-
ment facilities, it is not surprising that
the incidences of hepatitis, teenage
crime, vandalism, neurosis and worse,
seem to be increasing on Sydney’s outer-
most fringes and decreasing in almost
all other suburbs.
The remedy seems to be a shift in
emphasis from the building of houses to
the development of new communities,
comprehensively designed and equipped.
The future shape of megalopolis
HThis emphasis on the creation of
housing in coherent and compre-
hensively designed communities has
steadily, since the war, become the
major emphasis of British, Continental
and US policies and programmes. In this
field, as in others, Australia suffers from
cultural lag.
This is the emphasis that the NSW
State Planning Authority is intended to
give as witnessed by the repeated
use of the word “co-ordination” in its
brief. Perhaps one of the first tasks of
the Authority will be to co-ordinate
plans for massive investment in an inte-
grated metropolitan system of transpor-
tation by rail, bus and private car. By
its membership, the Authority should be
ideally constituted to solve this over-
all problem of co-ordinated planning
and investment in all forms of trans-
portation.
But future transportation must be
designed to serve a future pattern of
living and a pattern of land use. The
Authority's biggest task of all will be
to decide upon a coherent pattern of
development for the whole central coast
urban region, from Port Stephens to
Kiama. The Authority has, say, about
5 to 7 years to research and plan the
next major structural shift towards the
regional cluster of cities. Existing urban
zonings will give the developers of
sprawl plenty of choice until about
1969 or 1971.
If we are to cope with a potential
6 million in Sydney Region by the year
2000, then they can’t all focus for
their everyday needs on the old Sydney
central city. Somehow or other, we
must break up and reform the main
congested mass of the metropolis into
a series of distinct city districts, each
focused on its own commercial and civic
centre. Beyond the present built-up
areas, we must find sites for new city
districts, temporarily resume the land,
and develop those new city districts to
some comprehensive design, separating
each from the other by networks of
open space.
The new centres will be like Parra-
matta and Bankstown are today, in the
range of their services and facilities.
But they will have to be comprehen-
sively planned and designed for either
redevelopment or new construction on
open land. Perhaps in some of them
we will achieve a new city centre like
those designed by the British for the
new towns of Cumbernauld and Hook,
in places like Campbelltown, Penrith,
Katoomba or in the Gosford district.
Then we will have one of Colin
Buchanan's “3-tier” city centres, with
public transport and vehicles on the
bottom, pedestrians and shops above, and
commercial and residential buildings
rising over the malls. Let us strive to
shorten the cultural lag.

OUT AND ABOUT
The Importance of
Being Versatile
“Ireland is waiting for its Writer ”
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Uim /fY trouble”, said Micheal Mac-
VI Liammoir with a good, deep
actor's sigh from his belly, “is
that I can do anything, anything that is
except a few practical things like driving
a car or a nail. But I can play any part.
Fay Compton was like that, too, and she
suffered for it. Not like Gielgud, for
instance, who does Shakespeare’s tragic
kings and becomes noted for one sort
of thing. Or, say, Chaplin with his
funny little man. When I say I am
versatile it's a confession not a boast.
If I have an unfulfilled ambition, it is
that I would like to leave one perfect
thing, something like one of Chopin’s
Preludes, behind me.”
However, Mr MacLiammoir shows no
sign of repenting his versatility. In be-
tween eight performances a week of his
one-man show, “The Importance of Be-
ing Oscar”, at the Phillip Theatre, Syd-
ney (“Oscar” will later go to Melbourne
and Adelaide), he is working on an Irish
musical, “The Speckledy Shawl”, pre-
paring a one-hour radio programme
about W. B. Yeats, and arranging a
one-man show for actress Luise Rainer,
based on the women in Chekhov.
The one, perfect thing will have to
emerge from all this activity, or from
the noted diaries which Mr MacLiam-
moir keeps almost constantly, and, dis-
concertingly, in Gaelic. The first of
these, published in English, told the
story of making the film “Othello”,
with Orson Welles. Welles was a plump,
white-faced youth of 18 when he turned
up at MacLiammoir's Gate Theatre in
Dublin for an audition. Another book,
compiled from diaries, was published
recently. This dealt with a tour of Ger-
many with Welles and Eartha Kitt. It
was called “Each Actor On His Ass”.
The title gave Mr MacLiammoir a bit
of trouble in America, but it’s from
“Hamlet”.
It is hard to believe that Mr Mac-
Liammoir spends much time sighing for
the one perfect creation. Most of the
time he rests very gratefully on his
laurels. His acting career began in Lon-
don before World War I when, as a
child, he appeared, wearing a sailor’s
cap, emblazoned “HMS Uncertain”,
with Noel Coward. Yeats persuaded
him back to Ireland and he has lived
there ever since, although he has tra-
veiled considerably. He lives in Ire-
land in spite of the fact that in his
autobiography, “All for Hecuba”, he
can castigate Ireland: “You can’t stop
wearing that old grey shawl”, and de-
clares, too, that “a land that in its own
estimation is stainless is an unproductive
bore.”
It is also in spite of the fact that the
Gate Theatre, to which he devoted
nearly 30 years of his life, and where
he and Hilton Edwards produced more
than 350 plays, none of them by Mac-
Liammoir, is now given over to amateur
theatricals or the cosy-cottage school of
Irish playwriting.
He is philosophic about this, mainly
because, although he ran the theatre
without debt for 30 years, he knew from
the start that even if it achieved high
renown, returns would remain low.
“It is simply a question of popula-
tion,” he said. “Dublin has only
500,000 people. A resident theatre can
run only on a repertory system. We
had fortnightly repertory, and it was
only when we put on something like
Shaw’s ‘St Joan’, which ran four months,
that we had time to live. But the box-
office was at most £6OO a week.”
The Gate was never subsidised and
when the Abbey Theatre was burnt
down a decade ago Mr MacLiammoir
knew the Gate never would get help.
“The Abbey was the national theatre
and we knew that whatever money there
was would go to it,” he said.
However, although Mr MacLiam-
moir had to turn to one-man shows to
make a living (he has been doing “Os-
car” for four years and does an Irish
literature one, from the Druids to Joyce,
as well) he is still hopeful of reviving
the fame of the Gate. “I think we
could do plays with small casts in co-
operation with Irish television,” he said.
But he feels that at present there is
a “certain slump” in Irish writing.
“As far as writing is concerned,
everything went wrong after Ireland got
her independence,” he said. “There
were the long centuries of writing, then
she was free. It was like a man let out
of prison. But the Irish went on writing
their gaol journals. I see a lot of
manuscripts and they’re still about the
Black and Tans. I say to young writers,
why can't you look life in the face?
Why can’t you write about Mr and Mrs
O’Brien, of Rathmines? Ibsen wrote
about the Norwegian Mr and Mrs
O'Brien of Rathmines. They’re life, not
something that’s just a dream.
“Ireland is waiting for its writer, just
as Italy waited for Dante and England
waited for Shakespeare. Behan pro-
bably got closer than anyone to seeing
Irish life as it really is today. Beckett
is off on a narrow track of his own.
Joyce always seems to me to have

which Ford engineers have proved their

the driving position is far superior to the
earlier cars.”

needs a quick washdown with water to
bring up the sparkle and, at most, a twice-
a-year polishing to preserve the show-
room finish.”
Clyde Hodgins, Sydney Sun, February

sion are by now common knowledge; that
its three engines now develop 96, 111, or

clude much tougher suspension and body
panels and electric windscreen wipers.
“Most important is that this Falcon is an
almost entirely Australian-designed car,
very unlike the current 1964 US version.
“The body styling changes have given the
car a trimmer, squarer look than the XL,
and the general effect is to make the
Falcon even more the prettiest car in
its class . . .
“I discovered that this new car handles
very like a Cortina safe and faithful,
with very little body roll and excellent
adhesion . . .

not hard to find evidence of the care and

A dramatised reading with music
of the "LESTRYGON lANS' 7 episode
been a poisoned genius caught in a
grimace by his own bitterness.”
Although Mr MacLiammoir has been
doing his one-man shows for four years,
he admits that he “adores them”.
“Of course, it’s terrifying,” he said.
“I begin the Wilde one sitting on a
sofa. Then I stand up, and every time
I say to myself, I’m going to fall over,
or, my head’s going to fall off. But
once I’m going I love it. On the one
hand, there are no other actors to put
you off and no fear that you will fail
the people on stage with you. But, on
the other hand, there is absolutely no-
thing, like pretty actresses, to distract
the audience. And it’s quite a feat of
memory, too. More than two hours of
it.”
Mr MacLiammoir said he had chosen
Wilde first because the melodrama of
Wilde’s life was “money for jam” for
an actor. “Then I can do him as I
can’t do O'Casey or Behan,” he said.
“I can do Yeats, but his life was not so
dramatic, and I don’t know if people
would take more than two hours of
Yeats now.
“But there are many qualities I ad-
mire about Wilde. His mystery and
elegance, his indestructible good humor,
his wit, his humanity.”
Mr MacLiammoir has one gift of the
Irish gods which may remain a legend,
as it has remained with Wilde. That is
his ability to talk. Even two days in
Sydney, in an Indian summer which was
something like a steam-bath in Bom-
bay, during which he had been besieged
by television, radio and Press, had gone
nowhere near flattening him. You get
so used to actors saving their voices,
politicians conserving their opinions,
and writers husbanding their anecdotes
that Mr MacLiammoir’s rich rumble hits
you like a flood tide.
He even had time for an anecdote
about Melba. “My brother-in-law,
Anew McMaster, was in Australia
with his theatrical company in the ’twen-
ties”, he said. “And in Melbourne, Mel-
bourne of all places, he was asked to
make a speech at a banquet in honor of
the great Nellie. Anew got up, ner-
vously, and began: ‘lt is a great honor,
here in Melbourne, to propose a toast to
one of the world’s greatest singers.”
Melba looked up from her plate. ‘Not
one of the greatest’, she said. ‘The
greatest. And don’t you jrget it,
ducky’. Then went back to her dinner.”
The Madrigal
Man
Deller and his Consort
THhe Deller Consort was one of the
artistic successes of the Adelaide
Festival, and its leader, Mr Alfred Deller,
in his modest, cheerful way was one of
the social successes. Mr Deller and his
singers are now in Sydney for the Musica
Viva.
Mr Deller has long ago lost any self-
consciousness about audience reaction
when his delicate counter-tenor voice
emerges from his robust figure. However,
it has taken him almost his 32 years of
professional singing of Elizabethan and
mediaeval music to rid the general public
of the idea that the place for a madrigal
singer is in an amusing revue sketch.
“For so long the only people in the
field were well-intentioned amateurs,” he
told us. “They left a bad legacy and the
impression that this music was without
guts.”
Mr Deller said that most madrigals
were now in published editions, but there
could be all sorts of surprises in earlier
music. He said that as short a time ago
as 1955 a musicologist, working in what
was reputed to be a well-indexed library,
unearthed more than a hundred com-
pletely unknown lute songs.
“Perhaps the most exciting thing about
them is that they had been transcribed
by a master for a pupil and all the
ornamentation was there,” he said. “This
really was the first idea we had of how
much ornamentation singers of the
period used. It normally followed un-
written conventions. Since then we've
been able to let our heads go, because
the early singers used a great deal more
ornament than we'd been game to.”
Mr Deller said that he was in no way
a musicologist himself and has to rely
on their help to transpose the early
music to modern notation. “It is then
our job to make it come alive,” Mr
Deller said.
Mr Deller said he did not have to
worry about his voice any more than
any other singer. “I have been singing
professionally for 32 years and I was a
choir boy before that,” he said. With due
modesty, he said that the most promising
counter-tenor in England was his 25-
year-old son, Mark, who had his first
solo concert in London in February.

Salt water can’t harm this boat...it’s care-free aluminium from prop to prow!
While timber will yield to the sea and many
metals will decay or rust, Alcoa’s corrosion-
resistant aluminium alloys defy deterioration.
They also offer strength, light weight and many
other desirable properties.
Alcoa of Australia has a whole family of such
alloys specifically developed for corrosive con-
ditions. In marine use, for example, their
applications range from the hulls and motors
of pleasure craft to the superstructure of
giant ocean liners. For other outdoor purposes,
properly specified aluminium alloys withstand
weathering practically maintenance-free, even
in sea-coast and industrial environments.
Typical users are truck bodies and transmis-
sion towers, light standards and lawn furni-
ture ... and an entire range of building
materials, from windows and siding for homes
to aluminium cladding for towering sky-
scrapers. Containers made of these alloys are
even used to transport certain hard-to-handle
chemicals like red-fuming nitric acid and
hydrogen peroxide.
Aluminium conducts heat and electricity, and
reflects heat and light. It is non-magnetic,
non-toxic, and impact absorbing. It is less
costly than other non-ferrous metals, and is
available in every form known to the metal
working industry. Aluminium has a wider range
of finishes than any other metal, providing

Four US Options in Vietnam
Give up? Continue? Attack North Vietnam? Negotiate?
From BERNARD FALL in New York
With the fall of Dienbienphu on
May 7, 1954, the first Western
attempt to save Laos and the
northern provinces of Vietnam from
Communist-led revolutionary warfare
came to an end. Today the same con-
ditions that impelled the French to make
the bitter choice between broadening
the scope of the war or cutting their
losses face the United States and the
South Vietnamese Government we are
committed to support. And once again
the choices must be evaluated primarily
on the basis of available military facts
and figures.
The situation in South Vietnam today
is militarily serious but by no means
desperate, if you look only at the
numerical balance sheets. On the South
Vietnamese side, there are forces of
some 530,000 men that include the
Army of the Republic of Vietnam
(arvn, known among the Americans as
“the Arvins”), probably the best-equip-
ped army of its size in the non-Commu-
nist world; a militarised Civil Guard;
local militiamen grouped in the Self-
Defence Corps (sdc); and various police
and special units. In addition, there
are at least 15,500 American military
“advisers”.
The Communist insurgent forces, or
Vietcong as they are called by the South
Vietnamese, are both smaller in number
and far poorer in terms of equipment.
There are three types of combat units:
a hard-core body known as Chu-Luc
(Main Force), regional units, and the
local militia. The hard-core units, used
for all major attacks against the arvn,
are composed of those veterans of the
war against the French who stayed in
South Vietnam after 1954 or who went
north for additional training and later
reinfiltrated southward. Some Chu-Luc
units operate as regiments of about 2500
men, but most are in 500-man mobile
battalions that may be shifted from pro-
vince to province or even from region
to region from the mountain plateau
area to the Mekong Delta, for example,
as happened throughout 1963.
The regional units operate in com-
pany strength within a given province
that they know well. They carry out
small combat missions of their own,
such as ambushes or sabotage; but their
key mission is to serve as “protective
coloration” when a hard-core unit
arrives in their area. One or several
companies of the regional units join the
Chu-Luc for the duration of its opera-
tion in the province and thus provide
the larger unit with local eyes and ears,
food or medical supplies requisitioned
on the spot, and also with fairly well-
trained replacements. When the hard-
core unit strikes, the local militia levies
come into their own. They act as
guides and lookouts for the regulars and
regionals. It is the local levies that give
the Vietcong units their frightening
ability to be at home almost everywhere.
If the attack succeeds, the local Viet-
cong militiamen will “clean .up” the
battlefield, hide the booty, bury the dead
of their own side, and care for its
wounded before the arvn can take an
accurate count of enemy losses. And if,
by rare chance, the regular Vietcong
unit falls into a trap, the militia are
expected to bear the brunt of the rear-
guard fighting until the regulars have
again disappeared into the jungle or into
the impenetrable maze of canals and
swamps. The elite of the militia.eventu-
ally “graduate” into the regional units.
Much later, after years of fighting and
political indoctrination, the one-time
peasant may become a hard-bitten Chu-
Luc if he lives that long.
Intelligence estimates of the exact
number of Vietcong operating in South
Vietnam have hardly varied over the
past four years. A figure of between
22,000 to 25,000 regulars is generally
admitted, supplemented by perhaps
60,000 to 80,000 irregulars. These
figures are the basis for the optimism dis-
played by senior American officers both
in Saigon and in the Pentagon. During
the Indo-China war, the French were
fighting at a “tie-down ratio” of 1.5 to 1,
which is notoriously insufficient to win
against guerrillas. In South Vietnam
today, the proportions are 16 to 1 if
one counts the hard-core Vietcong only,
and still 5 to 1 in favor of the arvn

when one includes all the Communist
guerrillas.
For many the slide rule and the com-
puter are articles of faith in measuring
“success” or “failure”. In Vietnam, that
familiar military yardstick, the front
line, is disconcertingly absent. In Korea,
when the US forces were compressed
into the Pusan perimeter, there were
no possible pretexts for optimistic head-
lines; after two years of military stale-
mate, the need for some sort of political
accommodation became obvious. In
Vietnam, success or failure must be
measured by far more controversial
standards. There is, first of all, the “kill
count” or “body count”, i.e., the num-
ber of enemy bodies actually counted
on the battlefield. The trouble with the
body count is that Vietcong have the
habit of picking up their casualties,
dead or wounded, under all but the
direst circumstances precisely to pre-
vent an accurate estimate of how badly
they have been hurt. Often many of
the dead, particularly those killed by
strafing or bombing, are innocent civi-
lians. Their numbers inflate the kill
counts of Pentagon briefers but in no
way affect the Vietcong combat poten-
tial. The kill count, though discredited,
is being used religiously to this day.
The official (and largely meaningless)
estimate of Vietcong killed from mid-
-1957 up to January, 1964, is about
125,000.
The “Incident Count”
A nother standard of measurement, and
one that is perhaps slightly more
representative of the real situation, is
the “incident count”; that is, the num-
ber of hostile acts in a given month.
Incidents are classified into four cate-
gories: armed attacks, terrorism, sabo-
tage, and propaganda; and the shift of
emphasis from one category to the other
is in itself considered significant. Where
the incident count proves itself reliable
is in lumping together the isolated
shooting of a village guard and the
battalion-size attack against a whole
government garrison. Very often, a
numerical decrease of Vietcong activi-
ties is more than compensated by the
fact that each individual action is far
larger than in previous weeks, or that
the enemy places emphasis on more
violent incidents: for example, of the
738 incidents reported for the week of
February 7-14, 1964, close to seventy
per cent involved acts of terrorism. In
any event, judging by the British ex-
perience in Malaya, where a total inci-
dent count of thirty a month was con-
sidered the equivalent of “victory”,
South Vietnam still has a long way to
go.
Air operations have two yardsticks of
success. One is called the “structure
count”, and the other is simply the ton-
nage of bombs or the amount of cannon
or machine-gun ammunition expended.
The structure count records the number
of houses destroyed by bombing or
napalm. Any house designated by the
Forward Air Controller as a target auto-
matically becomes a Vietcong house and
any village burned to the ground a
Vietcong village, regardless of actual
political allegiance.
Finally, there are such conventional
criteria as the number of weapons lost
by either side. Here again, the record
shows that South Vietnamese command-
ers, for fear of loss of face or repri-
mand, have tended to understate their
own losses and overstate those of the
Vietcong. This has become a great deal
less likely now that American advisers
can be found even at the lowest unit
levels. How disastrously bad the situ-
ation was in past years can only be
guessed at one educated guess is
125,000 light weapons lost to the Viet-
cong in the past two years but the
Pentagon officially admitted a loss rate
of 234 weapons a week for the last
three months of 1963, or more than
12,000 weapons for the year, as against
average weekly Vietcong losses of
ninety-seven weapons. The terms of
comparison are relatively meaningless:
“our” Vietnamese lose brand-new super-
modern American weapons and the
Vietcong lose home-made zip-guns,
although in recent months the arvn
have been recapturing American wea-
pons. The huge amount of US wea-
pons available to the Vietcong through
capture, theft, or even sale reduces the
importance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail
as a supply line from North Vietnam.
It was important much earlier in the
insurrection when organised units came
south to become the nucleus of the
hard-core battalions. Now the insur-
gency has reached the point where to
a large extent it feeds on the enemy, in
true Mao Tse-tung fashion. The trail,
however, can still be useful for funnel-
ing in special replacements (saboteurs,
anti-aircraft gunners, political cadres)
and will be difficult to cut altogether.
As this picture of the military aspects
of the South Vietnamese war unfolds,
it becomes abundantly clear that in a
war without fronts and without hard-
and-fast criteria of success, victory in
the accepted sense of the word, or even
in accordance with some new counter-
insurgency abstraction such as “effective
control” of ninety per cent of the popu-
lation, becomes an elusive target. This
realisation, which has belatedly come
to Washington, has finally brought
pressure on the Administration for a re-
examination of the various possibilities
(the official term is “options”) to resolve
the Vietnamese conflict. Added to this
pressure is a desire to do something to
prevent the situation from becoming a
political liability for the Democrats in
November.
In brief, the four major options can
be defined as follows:
O Let South Vietnam go down the
drain by pulling American troops out at
a given date, regardless of the situation
on the ground.
• Continue the present type of
“proxy war” for as long as another ten
years if necessary, and try to win under
the present ground rules, with perhaps
both a larger South Vietnamese and
American commitment. At the moment,
this seems to be the official Administra-
tion line.
• “Conventionalise” the war by
escalating it from a counter-guerrilla
operation in South Vietnam to full-size
combat operations against North Viet-
nam and, if necessary eventually, Red
China. This is the new “hard” line
advocated by less cautious officials in
Washington.
• Negotiate with the enemy not
from the present position of weakness
but from a position of strength created
out of a sober-minded appraisal of Com-
munist weaknesses and Western strength
in the Far East as a whole. This alter-
native is often conveniently confused
with the first option by those who fear
that any settlement whatsoever would
mean neutralisation, followed by a
Communist takeover.
Communist alternatives
Tronically, the Communist planners in
North Vietnam seem to agree on the
alternatives. They were described to
the North Vietnamese higher cadres in
the January, 1964, issue of “Hoc Tap”
(“Studies”), the North Vietnamese
Communist Party’s theoretical monthly,
as follows:
“# The United States must withdraw
from South Vietnam and let the South
Vietnamese people settle their affairs by
themselves.
“# The United States will introduce
into South Vietnam hundreds of thous-
ands of more troops and large quantities
of arms, and apply new techniques to
carry on the war for some more years.
“# The United States will broaden

its present special war [i.e., counter-insur-
gency operations], and invade North
Vietnam in an attempt to win victory
in South Vietnam.”
Needless to say, Hanoi has no reason
to publicise the fourth option, which
from its standpoint is the least desirable
course for the United States to
adopt; and for entirely different reasons,
Washington seems to agree with Hanoi.
Of the four US options, the first two
are temptingly the simplest and may
well be advocated by the same people
at different times.
After all, a time may come when
presumably if it is obvious that the
South Vietnamese are not pulling their
own weight militarily and politically,
the United States would simply get out
of the war by refusing to increase its
commitments while at the same time
refusing to have any part of a negoti-
ated settlement. That solution, it should
be remembered, was in effect the course
followed by the Eisenhower Administra-
tion at the end of the French-Indo-Chi-
nese war in 1954. When it became
obvious that the French would not or
could not win the war as the Dienbien-
phu disaster took shape, Eisenhower,
with the support of General Matthew
Ridgway, then Chief of Staff of the US
Army, prevailed over the counsel of
Vice-President Nixon and Admiral Rad-
ford, who advocated the use of Ameri-
can troops to save the French in Indo-
China. And the late Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles at the ensuing
Geneva conference of April-July, 1954,
steadfastly refused to sign “any treaty
that makes anybody a slave”.
In short, by refusing to accept a full
measure of participation in the Geneva
negotiations in 1954, the United States
lost the opportunity to help shape the
terms of the settlement and to use its
power effectively in implementing the
pact. Such an abdication of responsibi-
lity is of course unthinkable in 1964.
The second option winning the
war under present ground rules
would entail, on the basis of experience
in other such wars, either doubling the
number of South Vietnamese men under
arms to one million or putting in two
or three American army corps (about
200,000 men, with all attached ser-
vices). In either case, civilian counter-
insurgency programmes would also have
to be increased by substantial financial
aid. These troop figures are not pulled
■out of thin air. As has been shown,
the present ratio of friendly v. hostile
fighters is 5 to 1. Experience from
Malaya to Algeria to Cyprus has shown
that in order to break even (let alone
win) militarily, a ratio of at least 15 to
1 is required. As for the use of Ameri-
can fighting troops in constituted units
rather than as isolated “advisers”, it
would probably give the South Vietna-

mese Army the same lift in morale it
gave the South Korean troops in 1950.
The argument that the presence of
American field troops would give sub-
stance to Communist charges of Ame-
rican imperialism can be considered
baseless the Communists are using
the argument anyhow, and even the
popular French magazine “Paris-Match”
recently termed that argument a “con-
vention whose hypocrisy is only match-
ed by its absurdity”.
There remains the problem of feasi-
bility. To double the number of armed
Vietnamese would mean to boost Ameri-
can expenditures in Vietnam far over
a billion dollars a year. It would also
entail sending far more American advi-
sers to the area. As for the alternative
step of sending, say, six US divisions to
Vietnam, that would almost deplete the
whole American strategic reserve, unless
the draft is radically increased. What
all this would do in terms of increased
budget expenditures, the dollar gap, and
mounting casualty lists can easily be
guessed at. And, as the French demon-
strated in Algeria or the British in Cyprus
and Palestine, there is no ironclad
guarantee of victory even through the
massive military approach.
To “escalate” the Vietnamese war
into a Korea-type operation extending
into the North Vietnamese sanctuary, as
outlined in Option No. 3, would com-
bine the expenses of the second option
with the tempting possibility of much
quicker and greater rewards. North
Vietnam is no longer the guerrilla
country the French knew. Ho Chi
Minh's regime now controls cities,
builds industries and irrigation systems,
runs railroads and airlines all through
the toil and sweat of the Vietnamese
themselves over the past decade and the
fairly large amount of Soviet-bloc eco-
nomic aid. All this provides very vul-
nerable conventional targets for Ameri-
can airpower. The rulers in Hanoi are
fully aware of this and are obviously
worried about it. I recall seeing un-
muzzled anti-aircraft guns pointing sky-
ward near industrial installations north
of Hanoi in 1962; and Georges Chaf-
fard, a reporter of “Le Monde”, recently
noted similar anti-aircraft installations
near the coastal city of Haiphong.
“We must be vigilant,” said his North
Vietnamese guide to him. “We’re not
at peace yet. The American aggressors
fight against our brothers in the South
and may well attack us here.”
It is a matter of debate whether such
an attack on the North Vietnamese
heartland, the Red River Delta, would
yield the desired dividends in terms of
South Vietnamese pacification. As has
been shown before, the Vietcong in South
Vietnam do not depend to a very great
extent upon North Vietnamese supplies
and even less upon North Vietnamese

manpower. If we expand the war to
North Vietnam, we simply return to
the French situation before 1954
assuming that Red China would not join
the fray and expand the war even fur-
ther. Furthermore, it is military idiocy
to believe that the South Vietnamese
Army, which cannot even hold on to
major communication lines fifteen miles
outside Saigon, could provide the back-
bone for a northern invasion. As in
the case of Korea, where there also was
an initial attempt to limit the American
commitment to naval and air support,
large American ground units would
have to be thrown into the battle.
Such considerations doubtless explain
the urgent attention Washington is now
giving to the less risky proposition of
mounting major guerrilla operations
across the border against North Viet-
nam. This would not represent a wholly
new departure. South Vietnamese sabo-
teurs have been parachuted periodically
into North Vietnam from US aircraft,
at least one of which was shot down.
But the North Vietnamese regime is
quite familiar with this kind of warfare,
and with its pervasive police-state system
has thus far succeeded in capturing
most parachuted or infiltrated agents.
There is an iron rule in the counter-
infiltration business: it’s pretty hard to
do if one's own bases are penetrated
and in South Vietnam today hardly an
airplane can take off without being im-
mediately spotted by pro-Communist
elements.
Carrying the war to North Vietnam
Tn short, a guerrilla operation in the
north, designed to dry up the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, has little likelihood of
making a dent in operations in the
Mekong Delta in time to be useful. But
it would, in turn, give the Hanoi regime
a good pretext for opening the flood-
gates for large-scale infiltration of the
south, thus far kept in check by the
almost but not quite dead International
Control Commission left over from the
1954 Geneva cease-fire. And this, too,
would return us to the French situation
of a generalised war.
Yet, carrying the war to North Viet-
nam in some form cannot be ruled out
as a logical possibility. The North
Vietnamese themselves, as evidenced in
the previously cited “Hoc Tap” article,
consider such a situation a distinct pos-
sibility, up to and including the use of
nuclear weapons by the United States.
In fact, much has been made in
recent weeks about statements from
Hanoi that apparently reject almost any
kind of peaceable solution except on its
own terms, thus justifying the position
of the bitter-enders in the United States
who see salvation only in Option 2 or 3.
Another interpretation of the “Hoc Tap”
articles is that Ho Chi Minh's regime
now has definitely thrown in its lot with
Peking and is willing to pursue the
war against South Vietnam no matter
how great the risk.
A careful reading of the whole article
and subsequent comments from Hanoi,
Peking, and Moscow makes this far
from crystal clear. The North Vietna-
mese prose is just as obscure as ever.
For example, extracts rebroadcast by
Peking contain the following passage:
“Taking strategic offence against the
enemy does not mean pursuance of an
adventurist policy by the socialist camp
to eliminate imperialism by means of
a world war, nor the start of armed up-
risings and revolutionary wars to elimi-
nate imperialism by the people of capi-
talist countries before a situation favor-
able to imminent revolution has
emerged.”
And in the next paragraph, the Hanoi
text speaks of making “strategic attacks
on the enemy politically” rather than
through outright military operations. To
be sure, the text pays obeisance to the
Peking line condemning co-operation
with “US imperialism” as an “illusion”,
but another key text published on
January 21 in the Vietnamese Commu-
nist Party’s official newspaper “Nhan
Dan” (“Humanity”) also condemns
“dogmatism and sectarianism”, which are
the sins Moscow accuses Peking of. In
other words, Hanoi may well prefer to
pursue what a knowledgeable British
diplomat once called a “straight zigzag
line” between its Communist masters.
As for the struggle of the Vietcong
guerillas in South Vietnam, “Hoc Tap”
warned that their war would be “long,
hard, self-supporting (my italics), but
. . . certainly victorious”. To be sure,
all the Communist powers have stressed
the point that any attack against North
Vietnam might bring Red China, and
possibly the Soviet Union, into the fight,
but that is neither new nor particularly
revealing. In simple terms, Hanoi does
not now seem keenly interested in esca-
lating the war in South Vietnam to the
point where it would have to provide
the real estate for a slugging match be-
tween Red China and the United States;
the more so as the Vietcong in South
Vietnam seem to be doing reasonably
well on a “self-supporting” basis.
All this leaves ample room for
manoeuvre around the fourth option:
negotiating a settlement from a position
of strength. Over the last few years
Hanoi has substantially lowered its
sights: where it once insisted on early
reunification as its minimum goal, it is
now prepared to acknowledge the tem-
porary existence of two Vietnams as
separate states with “separate social
systems”. In fact, some French obser-
vers, notably Chaffard, assert that there
is even a difference of view on the sub-
ject between Hanoi and the Vietcong


Consider this beach part of your plant
As much a part of a modern plant as the design of the building or the planned
work-flow of the factory layout, is the nearness of clean spacious relaxation areas
for your executives and staff. Today’s industrial exodus from the more traditionally
industrial areas is paying big dividends for management. You will arrive at your
office fresh, and without the need to unwind after a tiring drive through heavy city
or industrial suburb traffic. Employee morale is lifted considerably when the plant
is situated in attractive surroundings. Psychologically, the fresh air and pleasant
work areas increase overall production by eliminating the subconscious resistance
to working in unpleasant environments.
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial highways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.

civilian arm, the Southern Liberation
Front, with the latter apparently willing
to be even more accommodating to the
West. This perhaps explains the un-
equivocal admission made by Mme Ngo
Dinh Nhu to the Right-wing Paris
weekly “Candide” of February 13 that
her husband had indeed been negotia-
ting with the Communists but not
via the French and not with Hanoi, but
with the Liberation Front on the spot.
His motive was “to seek ways to bring
them back into the fold”, says Mme
Nhu, but in all likelihood Nhu had
concluded that a coalition government
was the only way out of the military
cul-de-sac.
It is also noteworthy that Hanoi re-
cently disinterred the long-dead Geneva
Agreement and asked for its “correct im-
plementation” as a means of settling
the “South Vietnam issue”. The sugges-
tion is disingenuous on the face of it.
The application of an agreement that
the United States never signed scarcely
offers an acceptable solution to the pre-
sent problem, and preachment from
Hanoi about “correct implementation”
would seem to exceed even Communist
standards of cynicism. Nevertheless,
the suggestion opens up interesting pos-
sibilities. For the Geneva Agreement,
it will be recalled, allowed the presence
of over six hundred American advisers,
the number there at the time of the
cease-fire. It also provided for two
Vietnamese zones that would not be
tied to any power bloc. All this sug-
gests that Hanoi has not entirely made
up its mind as to what it wants, or
how to go about getting it without a
major war.
Another area for manoeuvre favor-
able to the West centres on Red China's
present weaknesses, both economic and
military. The Chinese have had to get
along for quite a while without Soviet
spare parts and maintenance help. To
Supply, say, twenty Chinese divisions
southward across Yunnan's chaotic ter-
rain would by no means be as easy as it
was to supply Chinese People's Volun-
teers in Korea from the excellent Man-
churian rail and road networks and from
nearby Soviet supply depots. Finally,
there is the handicap of two thousand
years of Vietnamese distrust of the
Chinese. The North Vietnamese in par-
ticular still recall with a shudder their
VJ-Day “liberation” by the Yunnanese
hordes.
The United States has other valuable
cards to play. For one, South Vietnam
has the surplus rice Hanoi needs. For
another, while a major guerrilla offen-
sive from North Vietnam would simply
face Saigon with more of the same, a
“counter-escalation” by the United
States of the war into North Vietnam,
even if confined to one single saturation
raid, could destroy the fruits of eight

1954. To be sure, Chinese planes might
appear in North Vietnamese skies the
next day, but that would be small con-
solation to North Vietnamese leaders
surrounded by devastation. In short,
Hanoi cannot really afford a total “vic-
tory” in South Vietnam if the price is
the destruction of its own economic
base, for that would bring about total
dependence on Red China. Further-
more, every new Communist military
success along the Mekong may speed
the day of both American and Chinese
intervention in North Vietnam.
The United States has yet another
trump: whether to push Hanoi into
Peking’s hands or allow it to retain or
even improve its present “straight zig-
zag line” is largely an American deci-
sion to make. A normalisation of trade
relations between the two Vietnams
bringing southern foodstuffs and rubber
northward and northern minerals and
manufactured goods southward—would
allow Hanoi to depend less on China
and to adopt a policy of national self-
determination within the Communist
bloc. That Moscow cannot do, but
Washington can.
When all is said and done, the real
American deterrent to Chinese military
intervention in Vietnam is not the
15,000-odd American advisers wading
around in the jungles of South Vietnam
in search of an ever-elusive enemy (only
two hundred out of a total of 3,450
weekly operations in South Vietnam
make any enemy contact at all) but the
US Seventh Fleet with its aircraft-car-
riers. That force can be brought to
bear on the Vietnamese situation at any
time as long as even a small American
“tripwire” exists in South Vietnam.
That deterrent has worked effectively
on the Chinese at Quemoy and ” r aiwan.
There is no reason to believe that it
could not be used effectively in a Viet-
namese settlement.
What special advantages might accrue
from this fourth option? First, it
would buy time for South Vietnam to
establish at least some sort of durable
political structure and to strengthen an
economy ravaged by more than a de-
cade of civil war. This sort of recon-
struction, impossible under Option 2
or 3, offers the only sound defence
against the inroads of Communist sub-
version, which can be expected to re-
main a major threat to the country for
years to come. Second, a settlement
based not on an abdication of our
responsibility but on a determined ap-
plication of our power and influence
in the area would permit the West to
increase North Vietnamese independ-
ence of Red China in exchange for an
end to the guerrilla warfare, thus barring
Red China from its most convenient
avenue of domination of South-east Asia.

TRY THESE IF YOU CAN'T BUY "THE GROUP"
has been another rough week.
Until now I have always managed
to keep pace with my banned book
reading. At school I read my Marie
Stopes; at an early age I got hold of
“Ulysses”. I read “Love Me, Sailor”,
“Lady Chatterley’s Lover”, and
“Lolita”, but so far I have been un-
able to get a copy of “The Group.”
It is not so much that one is a
pervert; it’s just that you feel so inade-
quate at parties if you haven't read
the latest banned book. Why, “The
Age” is devoting whole pages to
letters of discussion on the banning
of “The Group.” It is only natural
to want to be as horrified as the next
man.
Many of the letters suggested that,
after all, “The Group” was rather
mild fare, and there was much more
exciting material to be found at one’s
“nearest newstand.” I hurried at
once to the nearest newstand. It had
a magnificent display of both paper-
backs and glossy magazines. After a
quick calculation it was clear
that 92 per cent of all publications
had pictures of girls on the cover.
Frankly, since the departure of
the lush American publications like
“Playboy”, the magazines were not
awfully good. A best-seller was
“Health and Efficiency,” 3s. 6d., “100
Pages on the World of Naturism.”
Of the 100 pages at least 80 were
devoted to jolly groups of men and
breasty ladies, au naturel. Actually
neither the men nor the women are
as naturel as they once were, because
all delicate portions have been re-
touched on the photographs, leaving
alarming results, particularly for the
men. Apart from the photographs
there were club notes from all the
various sun clubs. Beech Tree Sun
Club (Medway Downs) reported:
“Vacancies exist for couples, families
and single ladies. Unfortunately all
the vacancies for single men are
now filled. Sorry, chaps.”
There was “Gags, Girls Uncen-
sorcd”: “A riotous round-up of the
best and boldest in American illus-
trated humor.” And, of course, the
old standbys like “Men Only”, which
clearly was heavily under the influence
of “Playboy”, with a combination of
bare girls and serious articles. Their
cover story, for example, was “Man
is Master of his Virility.” Inside
there was a picture of a lady with a
knowing look and a disconsolate-look-
ing man, obviously worried to dis-
traction about his virility. The story
led off with a quote by Dr Marion
Hilliard: “A man places virility at
the pinnacle of all his achievements.
The only comparable thing in women
is the importance they place on their
breasts.”
So I continued my survey of the
nearest newstand. In the pocket books
it was jolly hard to know w'here to
start. Here was a naked-slave-girl-in-
ancient-Rome cover: “The monstrous
vices, the rape and violence, the
follies and passions of the licentious
Emperor Commodus led to the fall
of the Roman Empire.'” Mr Gibbon,
I think, would have loved it. Then
there was “Tikai”, by R. W. Hunter:
“A Lusty, Intimate Story of Naked
Desire in the Adventurous East
Indies.” The cover showed a naked
and magnificently proportioned native
girl chained to a post. You notice
that girls who get chained to posts
on paperbacks nearly always miss out
on clothes.
to this book was “Woman
Possessed” ... “A Startling Novel
of a Woman Torn by Her Own
Warped Emotions and Insatiable Pas-
sions.” The cover showed this warped,
emotional, insatiably passionate wo-
man in a nude state with a man on
a bed.
I was about to buy these books.
Then, I thought, say I was run over
on the way home with “Woman
Possessed” in my hand. Nobody
would ever understand. Instead I
bought two quieter covers - “Mata-
shona”, by Richard Paper . . . “Honest
and Brutal . . . Only the Strongest
Constitutions Could Take a Book Like
This”; and “The Hell Fire Club”, by
Daniel P. Mannix . . . “The Orgies
and Revels that Rocked the Nation.”
“Matashona” was the story of a
wealthy, Ivy League-type American
who, by some incredible twist of cir-
cumstance, found himself as a warder
at Matashona, a Rhodesian prison.
The story starts with an African
being thrashed on a triangle, and the
writer shows some ingenuity in
alternating violence with strong bed
scenes, which can also be violent.
The heroine is a beautiful “colored”,
Diana de Roos, who passes for white.
For over 150 pages this poor girl is
repeatedly getting thrashed, having
her clothes ripped off, being raped
and abducted. On page 122 comes
some of the most beautifully forget-
able dialogue in our language . . .
“Diana pulled away with a little
moan. ‘No, Max. No,’ she whispered.
“Your voice says no, but your
nipples say yes’.”
“Their lips sought each other in
desire.” As you may understand,
those talking nipples led to Diana's
downfall.
“The Hell Fire Club” was a com-
panion book to “The Maiden Tribute,”
by Charles Terrot. . . “The Fearful
Truth about White Slave Traffic in
Victorian England,” and, like all the
others, 4s. a copy. It made all the
others look tame. Here was a com-
plete run-down on orgies, incest,
prostitution, sodomy, and voyeurism.
You haven't heard of voyeurism? Nor
did I until I read “The Hell Fire
Club”. Voyeurism is the practice
of observing through a peep-hole
other couples in action. The book
repeatedly quotes the colorful bits
from “Fanny Hill”.
The story opens with a description
of Sir Francis Dashwood's garden at
West Wycombe. The garden was
elaborately designed to represent the
body of a naked woman, W'ith two
fountains that spouted white water
and one ordinary water from rather
obvious places.
So, you see, I have made a start.
Now I propose to work my way
through some or all the other paper-
backs on the newstand. At the rate
of three a day I will have no diffi-
culty, and should Mr Rylah take
exception to any of these I will be
in a brilliant position at cocktail
parties, f will have read the whole
darned lot.

THE BEATLES
Sir,
Mr Paul Johnson (21/3/64) has fallen
into the trap which has claimed so many
other pseudo and would-be-intellectuals
(ranging from the Conservatives’ Mr
Deedes to the editor of the “Anglican”)
—he has taken the Beatles seriously.
This is fatal. No one in his right mind,
least of all the fabulous (or frightful?)
Beatles, takes this thing seriously.
There are some things which may be
taken seriously, such as money and,
possibly, keeping juveniles out of
brothels; but to suggest that the Beatles
and their attendant mania could ever be
potent forces of culture, or anti-culture,
or anything else except fun, is carrying
the Beatles lark too far.
It is a lark, and a good lark at that.
Those who fail to see the funny side,
and insist on regurgitating these hack-
neyed diatribes against modern youth,
have somewhere missed the point. Was
it at the age of sixteen, while they were
busy admiring Beethoven and reading
Proust, when any normal boy would
have been out playing football or cricket?
But, then, pseudo-intellectuals don’t like
being thought of as normal, do they?

INDONESIAN “WAR LORDS”
Sir,
Geoffrey Fairbairn’s letter headed
“Indonesian ‘War Lords’” (21/3/64) is
not only damaging to high Indonesian
officials, including President Soekarno,
but also reflects an air of hostility
towards Indonesia.
Fairbairn’s calling President Soekarno
“Warlord-in-Chief” and the horrible and
most impressive story of “the constitu-
tional No 4 man . . .”, demonstrates
Fairbairn’s genius and most remarkable
ability for transforming cheap, twisted
accusations and personal dislikes into
“respectable truth”. As an example of
present “Warlords” in Indonesia, Fair-
bairn mentioned Brigadier-General Ibra-
him Adjie (Commander of the West
Java military district), Colonel Suharjo
(Commander of the East Kalimantan
military district), and Colonel Yusuf
(Commander of the South and South-
eastern Sulawesi military district). We
are proud to say that these ranking
military officials have proved themselves
to be effective civil administrators,
besides being outstanding military com-
manders.
It is well known even in Australia
that Australia’s late Minister for
Defence, Athol Townley, praised General
Adjie when Townley visited Indonesia
not so long ago. As for Colonel Suharjo,
he is known and disliked by certain
circles because he refused to be bullied
by big oil officials.
Geoffrey Fairbairn admitted that Indo-
nesia’s military command is not equiva-
lent to that in Australia. He is very
right about that; but this does not mean
that, because of the differences, the Indo-
nesian military command can be identi-
fied as a warlordism! Such a conclusion
can come only from someone who is
ignorant (or pretends to know) of Indo-
nesia’s military and civil service set-up,
especially from someone who harbors
hostile feelings towards Indonesia.
Concerning Indonesia waging war
against Malaysia because of President
Soekarno's personal ambition and Indo-
nesia’s envy of a “prosperous Malaysia”
•—no comment is needed. By the way,
“prosperous Malaysia” applies only to a
very special and small group of people
and certain foreign multi-millionaires.
For the bulk of the people of Malaysia
the word “prosperity” still means —•
“manna from Heaven”.

“THE BANALITY OF GOOD”
Sir,
One cannot but agree with May Sindon
(21/3/64) in deploring Dr Knopfel-
macher’s dismissal of concern over the
infringement of sovereignty involved in
the apprehension of Eichmann as “legal-
istic squabbles”. Every instance of tres-
pass by one power upon the sovereignty
of another for the purpose of bringing
a fugitive to justice before the courts
of the apprehender must give rise to
concern. But it is intolerable smugness
to state in the context of Eichmann and
his crimes that the guilty must “go free,
exposed and bearing his shame”. Such
recompense for Eichmann would indeed
have been a “blow to humanity”.
I am sorry to repeat what Dr K. con-
siders to be no more than a ritual in-
cantation, namely, “six million”. But
the effort of imagination must be made.
Suppose the Japanese invasion of Aus-
tralia had been successful and, when the
invader had been repulsed, the cities of
Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide
and Perth were found emptied of every
man, woman and child, systematically
done to death by the foulest means. Any
Australian worthy of the name would
have pledged himself to his dying day
to bring to book those responsible for
the crime.
There is no question here of the State
of Israel “assuming gratuitously the
terrible right to act on behalf of man-
kind”. The State of Israel acted in the
name of the Jewish people to exact
revenge? So be it.
The “banality of evil” argument re-
duces crime of the greatest enormity' to
the everyday level. By seeking to show
that it is in the nature of totalitarian
regimes to bring ordinary individuals to
carry out the most enormous crimes,
Hannah Arendt is concerned to show
the necessity for fighting totalitarianism
in all its forms. But this same argu-
ment results in removing the possibility
of moral and righteous indignation and
a sense of outrage. If we are to be
spared from the banality of evil, then
save, oh, save us from the banality of
good.

THE DFRB SCHEME
Sir,
I was very pleased to read your article
on the Defence Forces Retirement Bene-
fit scheme (21/3/64). I resigned from
the Regular Army as a major about
eight months ago because the conditions
of service, housing in particular, were
so bad that my wife’s health was being
seriously affected. When I resigned I
had served for over 19j years and had
contributed to the DFRB scheme since
it was started shortly after the war. On
leaving the Service I was refunded my
contributions only. Thus I was forced
to pay into a superannuation scheme
which, over a considerable period, in-
vested my money at more than 5 per
cent interest, and when the time came
to make a refund, kept that interest and
repaid me only my capital. You may
therefore add that as another undis-
closed source of income for the fund.
A further unsatisfactory aspect which
affected me was that under the DFRB
Act I was placed in exactly the same
category as an officer who is court-
martialled and cashiered. He also is
refunded his contributions without in-
terest. On the other hand, an officer
who is retired early because he is “dead
wood” is paid a substantial gratuity. In
other words it pays to linger on in the
Service if one is so inclined.
It is fair to say that the DFRB scheme
is administered with a callous disregard
for the interests of its contributors "and
in apparent ignorance of modern trends
in superannuation. Being run by public
servants in the Treasury Department and
as a compulsory monopoly, I daresay it
would be surprising if the state of affairs
were otherwise.

The Essential Oscar
Micheal MacLiammoir - no time for comedy
The Importance of Being Oscar.
Micheal MacLiammoir. Phillip
Theatre. Sydney.
Do You Know The Milky Way? Karl
Wittlinger. Independent Theatre
Sydney.
you go to Micheal Mac Lia-
m" moir’s remarkable evening on Oscar
Wilde you will see something perhaps
rather different from what the show’s
title indicates. MacLiammoir’s phrase
“The Importance of Being Oscar” moved
me to expect, from the phrase’s own
punning lightheartedness, an entertain-
ment w'hich would be rich in Wildean
comedy, full of the elegance of his con-
versations, relieved with many of the
famous witticisms, and crowned by the
lyric charm of his fairy tales. This was
not w'hat MacLiammoir gave us. His
evening is, in fact, a university lecture
with beautifully-spoken excerpts from
Wilde’s works, and a prodigious display
of acting virtuosity.
It is, in its latter half, a rather sombre
evening—in which the agonies of Wilde's
personal involvements with unworthy
friends and his doom-laden libel suit
against the Marquess of Queensberry
are the main elements.
Yet, granting all the great and proper
praise due to Mr MacLiammoir’s skill,
I am not sure if the show comes out as
a really satisfying piece of theatre. Or
of biography. Of course, there are
enough examples of Wilde’s writing to
ensure the night a success—but Wilde's
marriage and his genuine happiness in
his children are dismissed most briefly.
Those important mainsprings of his
talent that led to the string of sublime
comedies from 1891 on are not
examined. Nothing is said of the side
of Wilde that, in 1888, four years after
his marriage, produced “The Happy
Prince” —one of the prose masterpieces
of the language, and as pure, simple,
and charming as “Salome” was decadent.
A disproportionate amount of time is
allotted to Wilde’s troubles, including a
lengthy recital of “De Profundis” (whose
less appealing qualities Mr MacLiammoir
By KEVON KEMP
worked very hard to disguise), and “The
Ballad of Reading Gaol”.
In short, as you may have gathered,
I would have preferred more Wilde from
the period when the creative artist in
him was at the height, before 1895, and
less of the personal tragedy, which,
whilst inexpressibly sad, had nothing to
do with the great writing, the superb
comedies which comprise the essential
Oscar.
Tt’s a long way from Oscar Wilde to
A the contemporary Karl Wittlinger, a
German playwright whose reputation is
very considerable on the European scene,
but, due to lack of translation, is all but
unknown to the English-speaking theatre.
His “Do You Know The Milky Way?”
carries forward that theme of the up-
rooted and dispossessed man of modern
Europe w'hich has exercised many talents
recently. A German soldier, captured
by Russians, taken away to forced labor
for years after the war, returns home
finally after eleven years. His girl is
married, his friends have stolen his
estate, and when he reveals that he has
lost all proof that he is whom he says,
his friends drive him out as an impostor.
He gets the notion that he was really
born on a star. In many flashback
scenes, his attempts to establish a new
life with stolen identification documents
(those of a crook, as it happens) are
shown. All his hopes come to nothing,
because of the past of the man whose
life he has taken over.
There is much of value in this play,
but with only two characters all depends
upon acting skill. I could imagine the
right actor tearing an audience apart
with the role of The Man, the lost one,
but sadly enough James Dibble simply
did not have the technical equipment,
the attack, the fire, the depths of experi-
ence needed. Robert Levis, playing
seven or eight character roles in succes-
sion, was almost as adroit in his task
as Alec Guinness, who loves this sort
of thing, but without good playing from
The Man the play falls dead. May
Hollinworth produced it with feeling
and a sure simplicity of effect.
ART
Easter Prize
Royal Easter Show Art Competitions.
Sydney.
"IVfiTH £2700 in prizemoney, the six
sections of the RAS competitions
turn up a huge entry which represents a
fair sample of the kind of attitudes
current in NSW art circles. From
avant-garde experiment to the true blue-
ness of academic impressionism, each
position can boast a fanatic devotee,
sometimes with a large following. Only
Pop is absent, or is it rather to be
found unsullied and undiscovered in
other sections of the Arts Pavilion?
Since landscape figures large as the
source for most contemporary abstrac-
tion, the roll of Sydney painters in the
Rural Modern section is pretty fair.
Frank Charvat’s winner, entitled
“Through A Country Town”, success-
fully combines metal collage with broad
tracts of reduced brown, whose spaces
recall expansive soil plains. Lynn supplies
a denseness and weight to the subject of
land itself, in its most material aspect.
Hessing assumes an almost baroque tur-
bulence of manner in his work while
Guy Warren seeks a complementary
scaffold for his landscape experience.
Plateresque lines inform the concepts of
Milgate’s restrained composition, a role
which is played by active paint surface
in Reddington’s, and spatial tension in
Plate's work.
Rodney Milgate’s “Lacrimae Rerum”
compresses these lines into a close inter-
weave, reminiscent of a certain phase of
lan Fairweather, to win the Human
Image prize. This section, though
superior to last year’s, must have afforded
a real headache to the judges, if the
uneven remains, relieved by Gould,
Dickerson, Herman and Connor, give
any clue to the quality of the rejects.
In such company the winning painting
has an immediate appeal.
Sharing the prize for the Industrial
Modern section, E. Raft accomplishes a
welcome integration of collage and paint
surface while Gilliland embraces a new
freedom of paint handling and a fresh
concept of space. Gould rises to an
energetic evocation of subject with broad
touches of near calligraphic line, while
Rapotec lustily sweeps in his impressions
of strength. Surprising entries in three
sections expose Eric Smith in a moment
of confusion, exhibiting a hastiness which
obscures his real ability.

Australian Owned—Australia Wide
Volume 1, Number 6
April. 1964
Two Heavy Jobs by Group
Two pictures on this page show units
of Brambles at work on projects of
national significance. Each illustrates the
Group’s ability to handle the heaviest
industrial work.
Road Lift for
Coal Exports
Coal exports through Port Kembla
for Japan have recently shown sharp
rises. Brambles Industrial Services are
carrying mammoth quantities by road
from the mines to the mechanical coal
loader at the ships’ sides.
Tipper trucks have averaged a lift of
4,000 tons a day over the past three
months.
On one occasion, 12,000 tons were
moved in 24 working hours to keep down
the loading times for three ships waiting
at the coal loading berth.
The vehicles covered a total of 10,000
miles in the 24 hours, hauling from Cor-
rimal, Coalcliff and South Buili collieries.
The average turn-round journey was 20
miles.
Water Main Laid
By the Mile
Lorain cranes on hire from the Sydney
Branch of CHEP together with skilled
operators have been working on a major
project for the Metropolitan Water,
Sewerage and Drainage Board in Sydney.
A new water pipeline from the Prospect
Reservoir has been laid across country to
provide an adequate water supply to the
fast-growing Northern Area of Sydney.
The CHEP cranes and their operators
have been on the job from the start and
have laid many miles of 48 inch diameter
piping during the last four years.

CHEP Aids Brewery
All Year Round
Summer died officially on March 1, but the public kept on
buying beer, Tooheys of Sydney kept on brewing it, and CHEP
kept on moving and storing untold bottles and cans at the
Auburn establishment.
Beer in bottles is fragile. Materials handling must be skilful
and the equipment must be exactly right.
CHEP has a permanent set-up of men. fork lifts and pallets
at the Auburn Bottling Depot of Tooheys to store empties,
position filled cases and cartons and load delivery transports.
The fork lifts are refuelled and serviced at Tooheys by
CHEP mobile services which work rapidly to a two-way radio
call system. Pallets from the CHEP pool are the key to fast
and safe handling of the merchandise that is always in so much
demand.
Trade Mission Sails
After Feverish Stowing
The Trade Ship ‘'Centaur’ cleared Sydney Heads at midnight
on March 4 after one of the most urgent and feverish stowing
jobs the port has yet seen.
“Centaur's" Asian ports of call are Singapore, Manila, Hong
Kong, Osaka and Tokio.
Brambles executive consultant aboard, Mr. S. A. Ferguson,
went partly as a representative for the Group and partly as
honorary customs adviser to the mission. During the hectic
days of loading in Sydney he took a big part in helping to
organise loading and stowage of the thousands of pieces of
display equipment for the more than 200 enterprises which had
taken space. The splendid efforts of the waterside workers
to load on time were warmly praised.
Mr. Ferguson took with him Brambles service literature in
three languages — English, Chinese and Japanese. Each
edition was printed in Sydney.
B.LS. Speeds
Rail Work in S.A.
The work associated with the construction of the new Norrie
Avenue Bridge at Whyalla highlights the type of service given
to customers of Brambles Industrial Services.
In preparation for this bridge over the Whyalla-Iron Knob
Tramway, a two-mile section of the line had to be lowered,
which firstly required a deviation line to keep the traffic
flowing.
Brambles Industrial Services formed the deviation embank-
ment, blasted 12,500 tons of rock to lower the main line, and
dumped the rock in the Harbour to form the external sections
of No. 2 Ore Loading Jetty for The Broken Hill Proprietary
Company Limited. Illustrated at right is a Brambles’ crane
working on the bridge.

Smoke Stack to Help
Boost Sugar Production
In the Burdekin Delta of tropical Queensland, sugar cane
crops are expanding and the Kalamia mill at Ayr has begun
a £900,000 expansion project.
Brambles Engineering (N.Q.) Pty. Ltd. in Townsville built
the 72-foot smoke stack above for a new generator, carted the
huge cylinder to Kalamia in one piece, and erected it on site.
Another stack, 25 feet longer, is destined for the Inkerman
Mill, at nearby Home Hill. Diagonally across Australia, the
picture below shows Brambles at work near Whyalla.
A Message from
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Continued progress of the Brambles Group and develop-
ment of services in so many fields have caused changes
to the senior management structure in the interest of better
service to our customers. These changes have brought
about a grouping of those activities closely allied to one
another. Two such groups recently created are:
Transport Group
* Dry Freight Carrying.
* Bulk Haulage of Liquids.
* Customs and Shipping.
* Air Freight and Travel Services.
* Bonded and Free Storage.
Industrial Services Group

* Earth Moving and Excavations.
* Heavy Mobile Plant operation such as cranes,
excavators, Euclid and heavy tipper vehicles, and
the like.
Mr. J. W. Jacob has been appointed General Manager
— Transport Group, and Mr. L. E. Marks has been ap-
pointed General Manager — Bulk Products Division of
that Group.
Mr. E. B. Williams, Interstate Manager, Brambles
Transport, is now also Commercial Manager — Transport
Group.
Mr. L. G. Medley, former Group Controller of the
Parent Company, has been appointed Commercial Mana-
ger — Industrial Services Group.
Mr. D. H. Chudleigh has been appointed Finance Man-
ager of Brambles Industries Limited. Mr. Chudleigh has

Isn't it time to take a long look at what
effect literary censorship has been—and is—
having on our national image? Are we re-
garded by the overseas literary world as
mid-Victorian and slightly prudish? And if
so, how has this unfortunate situation come
about?
Here, most topically, is the complete his-
tory of the treatment of obscenity, blas-
phemy and sedition (so-deemed by ruling
authorities!) in Australia. All the facts pre-
sented are authentic and fully documented,
but this has in no way prevented the author
from sprinkling the whole with a light, de-
licious irony.

recent exhibitions from England, and
Robert Klippel, Nicholson’s wooden
sculptor, shows an original adaptation of
the gravepost idea; while Parr, Flugel-
man, Stagpoole and Lorraine Boreham
support with works of reasonable impact.
Perhaps the most successful work in
the traditional sections, by Sali Herman,
whose old skills reappear in “Mt Isa
Mines” as authentic romantic landscape,
is approached by E. Hall, M. Brady and
R. Zusters. Herman’s winning entry in
the Industrial section reminds one of the
difference between art as conceived as
skill in imitation and art as personal
testimony. D. Schluncke’s painting which
won the “Rural” falls into the first
category, its broken light factually
recorded tending to disperse rather than
integrate composition.
JOHN HENSHAW
Brisbane’s Boom
With the pessimists asking when
and how soon Australia’s art
boom will slump, it is interesting to take
a look at one capital city where art has
really boomed in recent years.
To those who hear little of Queens-
land except for its oil, its beef, the pro-
posed alumina works at Gladstone and
the State’s much vaunted “industrial
potential”, it may come as a surprise
that the last 12 months saw Brisbane
reach its peak as a boom town in art.
In Brisbane, art auctions are almost
as rare as a Queensland Art Gallery
spring clean-out which caused one about
a year ago; the number of Australian
paintings sold annually in the general
auction marts would scarcely keep a
couple of major artists in paint. But
Brisbane has very high painting per
capita selling power and at one-man
shows at gallery exhibitions it is in the
best-seller class. And figures which help
to prove this come from Brian John-
stone, director of the Johnstone Gallery,
where five shows which sold paintings
worth £4OOO and upwards were held last
year, in addition to other shows which
comfortably climbed over the £lOOO
mark.
Most of the sales were made on the
opening day. On the “best-seller” list
were Margaret Olley (£4000), Lawrence
Daws (£4000), Charles Blackman
(£4700), Donald Friend (£4000) and
Ray Crooke (£5500).
With a new gallery Gallery F
added to what was already Australia’s
largest private gallery, Brian Johnstone,
for one, seems confident that the Bris-
bane boom will last. The Moreton Gal-
leries began the year prosperously with
brand new carpeting and a remodelled
gallery. - The first show in February was
an interesting mixed one with interstaters
Albert Tucker, John Olsen and Ray
Crooke heading an impressive name list.
Another sign of confidence was the
end-of-1963 opening of a new gallery
in the Grand Central Arcade, Queen
Street. The only sign of uncertainty
comes from the Douglas Galleries which
opened with a show by Leonard French
only a year ago. Asked about his plans
for the year, director Jim Douglas gave
a “no comment” reply.
In the main, Brisbane buyers “buy
Australian” for their walls. And they
are not unusual in Brisbane in that art
buyers fall into roughly four categories:
those who buy as investments because
paintings look better on walls than
share certificates; women who buy art
in the same interior decorator spirit as
they buy new curtains; those who yield
to the not-so-hidden persuaders who
urge the status value of collections —•
and names; the genuine art lovers who
buy with appreciation and a quickened
response to the magic in a painting.
Two years ago, Laurie Thomas gave
an address on contemporary painting
when he was first appointed director of
the Queensland Art Gallery. Many
members of his audience reacted as
though modern art and especially
abstract art was a new Thomas discovery
and Picasso had been lost in limbo for
the last half-century or so. But this kind
of public ignorance is over-emphasised
and over-publicised in regard to Bris-
bane. It exists. And it often exists among
people whose incomes would allow
something better than a few bad ballet
prints. To an extent, it is also remarked
on because Brisbane people aren’t afraid
to be vocal in admitting their lack of
knowledge on matters which they would
like to know more about. But the over-
emphasis is unfair to those and there
is a strong body of them who are
artistically aware, well informed, and not
necessarily monied.
The enthusiasm for art in Brisbane
is real. There is a rash of people want-
ing to learn to paint and to exhibit their
paintings. Even the late Major Harold
Rubin, “anonymous donor” of the
Queensland Art Gallery's prize Picasso,
has been reported as saying that he would
probably hold an exhibition of his own
work. His wives are reputed to figure
largely as his subjects. Major Rubin
owned Australia’s finest collection of
Dobell paintings.
Brisbane has its art societies. The
Contemporary Art Society, the Royal
Queensland Art Society and the Half
Dozen Group are some of them. But it
is not a place of groups or movements
like Melbourne. There is no clearly
defined Brisbane school.
The climate for artists is easy going
when compared with Sydney. There
is little sharpening of competitive claws
among the artists. This may mean a
certain lack of stimulus but it is no bad
thing for an artist to live in a place
which allows him to develop in his own
way without group pressures or the
tug and pull of current vogues. Queens-
lander-by-adoption lan Fairweather has
found it rewarding to go away from
the city altogether and rarely leaves
Bribie Island.
While interstate artists have “dis-
covered” Brisbane as a market, some of
the best known artists living in Brisbane
go south for their exhibitions. Apart
from major group exhibitions like “Aus-
tralian Paintings Today”, the Brisbane
public rarely sees the work of Jon
Molvig.
Most Thursday nights, artists drop in
at Molvig’s studio. Artists like John
Aland, John Rigby, Neville Matthews,
are regulars. Up-and-coming painters
such as Gordon Shepherdson and Mer-
vyn Moriarty are also visitors. This is

around 10 p.m. From eight to ten each
Thursday, John Molvig conducts draw-

These classes are worth mentioning,
not only because Molvig provides excel-
lent tuition but because through them
he makes a direct personal contribution
to art. A couple of years back when
most teachers were upping their prices,
Molvig cut his. He aims only to make
enough money to pay his models. As
classes are well attended, he usually has
no trouble doing this but with students
free to come and go as they please,
around holiday times, there must be lean
nights when he is out of pocket for the
evening. And at the present time he
is using two models each Thursday.
Businessmen have received MBEs for

Hotels and small restaurants are in
the art swing in Brisbane. The Royal

nently on its walls and has recently con-
ducted an award-by-popular-vote art
competition. The Marise coffee lounge
always has interesting examples of
student work on display.
At least three commercial houses have
their own art galleries and at present
a Queen Street store is showing a collec-
tion of paintings on loan from the
Queensland Art Gallery.
Brisbane needs a new Queensland Art
Gallery and just where and when this
is to materialise is a constant point of
controversy.
PHYLLIS WOOLCOCK
Dream Images
Charles Blackman. South Yarra
Gallery. Melbourne.
/"Charles Blackman’s painting improves
as it becomes more ambiguous and
elusive, I suppose because the emotion
he aims to evoke, though real enough,
is not of the kind that can be firmly
grasped and built up. What goes on
inside his long succession of large, softly
painted women’s heads is not intended
to be known directly. Every one of his
paintings draws attention to the face, but
the face rejects open scrutiny. His people
all look within themselves; their eyes are
either closed or absently reflective; their
postures are often fixed by other than
physical forces; sometimes, especially in
more recent paintings, the face is only
partially painted.
His most constant imagery now is
dream imagery. Around the still, soft-
edged faces are the correlatives of the
dream glowing geometric patterns,
bunches of bright flowers, delicately
modulated colors. Thus he is not ex-
ploiting the mysterious (or, as so many
solemnly call it, the “mystical”) but
evoking as simply as he can the intan-
gible and always partly hidden world of
people's hopes, fears and inner pleasures.
The virtues Blackman adds to this
sound symbolist approach are a con-
siderable delicacy of feeling and a
thoroughly understood technique which
on the evidence of his most recent paint-
ings is becoming freer and more com-
manding. The former hard edges, which
often sharpened his color too much,
have been fused with the background.
The color now glows richly and sets the
work much more clearly in the regions
of feeling.
Blackman has not, however, in these
paintings departed substantially from his
earlier aims. He is concerned as always
with the still moment which hides the
wild and beautiful leaps of the mind.
It is an ideal world of sweet or dark
melancholy. The flowers will never be
so bright in real life, the pattern of
color will never . flow so intimately
around the figure. When these ideal
moments are delicately enough caught,
beautiful paintings result.
Even the poor paintings underline his
essential aim, though they make one
uneasy. Perhaps it is inevitable that this
sort of search after elusive feeling will
sometimes turn up mere sentimentality.
“The Silent Moment”, for instance, con-
sists of nothing more than two figures
(one mostly obscured) looking pensive.
Its solemnity is a good deal heavier than
either the moment or the posture can
bear. I have similar reservations about
the weighty melancholia of a red paint-
ing called “Remembrance”. Pathos is
an easily aroused emotion, and can
slip into any work almost unnoticed.
Yet the appeal of Blackman’s work
is that he can evoke convincingly real
emotions not far removed from such
pensioned-off sentimentality. He rarely
errs technically, and his best, like
“Dream Image”, “Drama”, or “In a
Glass Darkly”, is very good indeed.
These paintings are I think the best we
have seen of Blackman, and I wish him
success in his approaching Whitechapel
Gallery exhibition.

Far Too Kind
Encounter. Interview with Robert
Helpmann. Channel 7. Sydney.
Tohn Pringle’s news review, “Seven
Days”, and his interview programme,
“Encounter”, are both well-conceived.
They bear the mark of considerable-
erudition, taste, and research. But they
lack force and they lack color because
they do not revolve around strong
central personalities. Pringle himself is
quite clearly a very good director, but
on camera his manner is far too uncom-
fortable and hesitant, so that the points
he raises lose any conviction, and both
his reporting and interviewing become
timid where in intention they are quite
bold and vigorous.
John Pringle, unfortunately, is no John
Freeman. In the brilliant series of inter-
views Freeman conducted in his “Face
to Face” programme, his accurate, im-
personal probing exposed any pretence or
artificiality in his “guests” and by
implication (for Freeman never pursued
a point already made obvious by infer-
ence) he revealed their true character.
Freeman was never nasty, but there was
a sense of suspended malice, a predatory
quality beneath his politeness that was
always fascinating to watch and made
for incisive interviewing. Pringle has
none of this nor does his deputy, Richard
Croll. Croll’s interview with Robert
Helpmann was far too amiable and in-
consequential.
A man of so many parts, with such a
fluctuating and impulsive career behind
him, should have been an ideal subject,
but Croll was so genial and paid such
exaggerated tribute to good taste that
Helpmann took over almost completely.
What emerged was Helpmann’s picture
of Helpmann, perhaps an honest one, but
if it wasn't, it should have been up to
Richard Croll to find out.

Sunset of an Empire
£70,000 a year for firing salutes
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Verandah. James Pope-Hennessy.
Allen & Unwin. 655.
T suppose that if one wanted to observe
A the last effulgent sunset rays of
British colonial administration, one
would have to travel to Saint Helena or
Mauritius or the Falkland Islands, or
some such outpost still underlined in
imperial red on the atlases. While the
great chunks of continental territory in
Africa and Asia have become free and
self-governing Commonwealth republics,
the little colonies remain the last enclaves
of paternal British rule relics of the
immensa Britannicae pads majestas that
once embraced a quarter of the world’s
habitable land surface.
Life, of course, has changed even in
the remotest Crown Colonies. The
Governors are no longer quite the inde-
pendent proconsuls they were in the days
when despatches to and from Downing
Street took weeks on the journey. Events
in the most faraway corners of the
globe do not escape the censure of
international opinion. The little com-
munities of British colonists and officials
are less isolated, less self-assured and
less absorbed in the arcane vendettas
that once lent savor to life round the
flagpole of Government House. Never-
theless a good deal of the old atmos-
phere remains, endowed nowadays with
a sort of faded fm-de-siede charm.
In the high noon of mid-Victorian
times, before entry by competitive
examination disturbed the serene
nepotism of the Colonial Office, Britain
was served by a number of superbly
idiosyncratic Crown Colony rulers.
Among them, indeed pre-eminent among
them, was Sir John Pope Hennessy,
whose stormy passage through Labuan,
West Africa, the West Indies, Mauritius
and Hong Kong are described with
affectionate irony by his grandson, James
Pope-Hennessy, in “Verandah”.' This is
a delightful book, written with wit and
urbanity and backed by a solid under-
standing of the period. Sir John de-
served a biography, though the chief
interest of “Verandah” lies in its evoca-
tion of Crown Colony life between 1860
and 1890.
The nexus of the system was the
Colonial Office which in mid-Victorian
days was a cosy family of about 50
officials all, down to the humblest
clerk, “gentlemen of birth and position”
who lodged in a dim 18th-century
mansion in Downing Street. Though
the day's toil did not begin until 11 a.m.
they managed to get through an impres-
sive amount of work; sometimes more
than 25,000 letters, despatches and tele-
grams were received or transmitted in
a single year. The Governors most
popular within the Office were those
with the gift for “keeping things going
along quietly” in the territories they
ruled. The British Government thought
the Empire quite big enough and was
inclined to resist pressure from hungry
commercial interests to extend its
bounds. “We don't want any more
black men,” said one Colonial Secretary.
Neither did he want the black, brown
and yellow men already under protection
of the Union Jack unsettled by doubts
about the situation to which it had
pleased Providence to assign them.
Downing Street was firmly dedicated to
the status quo.
status quo suited the Crown
Colonists admirably, too. Despite the
rigors of climate and the absence of
some civilised refinements, life in the
smaller outposts of Empire could be
very pleasant. There was the tinkling
of teacups on shady Government House
lawns, the music of the garrison band
(all perspiration and pipeclay as it played
selections from Sullivan and Weber
behind the concealment of the foliage),
the click of croquet mallet as well-bred
young attaches engaged in combat the
daughters of the hierarchy, the amateur
dramatic society, the Queen’s birthday
garden party to which selected repre-
sentatives of the “natives” were invited
to partake of the graceful hospitality of
their rulers.
Occasions of modest pageantry, too,
as when the Admiral-on-Station arrived
with his warships or a foreign potentate
dropped in during a world tour. Hong
Kong was luckier than most in this
respect; one Governor there spent
£70,000 a year on firing salutes to dis-
tinguished visitors. The most important
regularly-recurring event was, of course,
the arrival of the mail steamer with its
budget of approving or mildly-expostula-
tory despatches from Downing Street,
its copies of “The Times” and “letters
from Home”. But what, more than
anything else, made life bearable was
the perpetual simmer of gossip and the
ceremonial gavotte-like forming and re-
forming of cliques round the Vice-Regal
court.
On the face of it, it would be hard
to imagine a more unlikely incumbent
of a Victorian Crown Colony governor-
ship than Sir John Pope Hennessy. It
was rightly said that no colony was ever
quite the same after he left it. His
official career surviving scandals, re-
bellions and a running private war with
the Colonial Office was a striking
illustration of the triumph of patronage
over experience. Once Sir John was
“in” he was “in”; it never seems to have
occurred to successive Colonial Secre-
taries simply to chuck him out of the
service.
Yet John Pope Hennessy started with
no traditional advantages. He was an
Irishman, a Catholic and the son of a
hide merchant in Cork—none of which
circumstances was likely to advance his
prospects when he decided to enter
politics. He was also an ardent Tory
and it was as a unique specimen, a
Tory Irish Nationalist, that he sat in
the House of Commons for six years.
He made a great impression on Disraeli
and, when the Tories returned to power
in 1866, it was decided that something
should be done for young Mr Pope
Hennessy. For some inexplicable reason
he was offered the post of Governor of
Labuan.
Pope Hennessy, who already held a
somewhat inflated view of his capacities,
would have preferred something more
important one of the Australian
colonies, for instance. Later in his career
he was actually appointed Governor of
Queensland, but the appointment was
cancelled because the Queenslanders
objected to a Catholic Governor. It is
fascinating to speculate how the explo-
sive little Irishman would have fared in
an Australian setting. There would cer-
tainly have been ructions, considering
his cavalier attitude to strict constitu-
tional procedures.
Once launched in Labuan, Pope
Hennessy’s career moved in a crescendo
of turmoil from one Crown Colony to
the next. His sympathy for the native
peoples outraged local British official-
dom, he contrived to antagonise most of
his, own supporters and his activities
kept the Colonial Office in a constant
fever of perturbation. “You might as
well pour acid into soda and marvel at
the effervescence as be amazed at the
commotion that follows Sir John's advent
in a Crown Colony,” said one observer.
His onslaught on the planter oligarchy
of the Barbados touched off a Negro
rebellion in the West Indies; his efforts
to establish a democratic constitution in
Mauritius almost led to violent collision
between the French and English inhabi-
tants of the island.

tation of a band of teetotal Dublin

policemen to clean up the fever-riddled
squalor of Labuan, enlivened his path
wherever he went. The most extraordi-
nary was the scandal that accelerated his
departure from Hong Kong. Pope Hen-
nessy interrupted a tete-a-tete between
his wife and a prominent member of the
Hong Kong Council who was filling in
an idle hour before tea by showing her
“indecent prints of classical statuary”
from the catalogue of the Museo Bor-
bonico in Naples. Pope Hennessy later
assaulted his rival with an umbrella; in
fact, according to the seducer, the
Governor tried to poke his eyes out with
it. It was, the Colonial Secretary noted
on his file in Downing Street, “a pitiful
business.”
But Pope Hennessy seemed almost
indestructible. Having been rejected by
Queensland, he was sent to govern
Mauritius, in the belief that, as an Irish-
man and a Catholic, he would be parti-
cularly acceptable to all sections of the
French community. Vain hope! He
was suspended from office, reinstated,
then finally recalled and told that no
other appointments would be offered to
him. He died two years later in 1891,
his expectations of re-entering politics
having been thwarted by ill-health. He
really did deserve a biographical salute,
and his grandson has provided an admir-
able one. At 655. it is also rather
expensive.
False Authority
Early Constitutional Development in
Australia. ACV Melbourne. Edited
by R. B. Joyce. University of
Queensland Press. 725.
Tn format and production this reissue
volume is a credit to the University
of. Queensland Press, even if the price,
like the price of a lot of university
press productions, is high. The book
is one of the standard standbys of uni-
versity historians who treat it with the
same reverence and trust as a Muslim
does the Koran. As the blurb records,
Professor La Nauze, Ernest Scott Pro-
fessor, Melbourne University’s prime
expert on Australian history, has ponti-
ficated that it is “one of the few books
on their subject (i.e., Australian history)
which leave little more to be said”. The
blurb speaks of the author’s “genius”
and the editor, Mr Joyce, certifies to the
accuracy of Professor La Nauze’s
verdict.
What is to be regretted is that an
editor with all the vast material which
has come to light since 1934, when Mel-
bourne’s book was first published, at his
disposal should not have corrected it to
be worthy of the description applied to
it and of his own unqualified admiration.
For its times, the book was a fairly
good attempt, but it is characterised by
superficiality due to the author’s lack
of knowledge of background, of basic
essentials of Colonial Office policy and
method, and even of constitutional per-
sonalities to whose work one would have
expected him to have frequent recourse.
It is notable, indeed, for being the
mother of some schoolboy howlers
which the learned professors have
pecked up with avidity.
Take for example the oft-repeated
legend about the legal authority who
advised Governor Macquarie about
the constitutional needs of the Colony.
On p. 30 Melbourne states that the
Governor-elect “knowing the situation
arising from the Bligh rebellion needed
careful handling,” “he sought expert
advice . . . from the counsel who was
consulted concerning the course of action
to be followed against those who had
organised the rebellion.” He writes that
J. W. Plummer, in complying with Mac-
quarie's request, referred to “the defects
which are apparent in the system of
Government hitherto prevailing in that
Colony.”
Now, the opening words of the letter
clearly show that it was unsolicited and
not written at Macquarie’s request; and
its contents would satisfy a child that
it was not written by “the counsel who
was consulted concerning the course of
action to be followed” against the
fomenters of the rebellion against Bligh”
—nor indeed by any lawyer.
Melbourne, who was something of a
parrot-historian, was no doubt influenced
by the opinion of that other earlier
blundering commentator, J. H. Watson,
who described it as a “semi-official”
letter, and so little informed about legal
diction that he immediately accepted it.
It is fantastic that any historian who
considered himself capable of writing
authoritatively on constitutional politics,
or any professor who felt himself capable
of deciding what is “thoroughly reliable”
in this field, would have accepted the
letter even at first glance as the work of
a famous legal constitutionalist who
had defended Warren Hastings, who
successfully defended Rumbold and
Melville when impeached and who had
been Lord Eldon’s junior in the defence
of Queen Caroline; one who had been
Solicitor-General in the Duke of Port-
land’s Ministry in 1807, and knighted,
and who had in immediate prospect the
post of Attorney-General, with the Vice-
Chancellorship of England coming up
and the Mastership of the Rolls to
follow in short order.
The bare fact trivial no doubt to
some professors that this great legal
magnate's name was not J. W. Plummer
(or T.W. as 1 think he was named in
the earlier edition and in Watson’s note),
but Sir Thomas Plumer, might have
given a schoolboy pause, even if the
very contents of the letter and the fact
that its writer closed it with an offer
to accept (gratis) the job of buying the
soap and slop clothing of the Colony
of NSW as its official agent. Yet
“scholar” after scholar has accepted as
gospel this ludicrous bit of “legal advice”
on which Melbourne expands to the
extent of three pages. It is one of many
passages which contradicts Mr Editor
Joyce’s dictum that it is “futile to preach
the doctrine of going back to original
sources,” and that one can safely trust
the professors. And it makes ridiculous
all the stern reproofs administered to
Macquarie by academics for going
against the advice of this great legal
authority.
For, alas, the great legal authority of
whom Melbourne and his followers stand
in almost awful respect, “armed with
(but sadly neglectful of) whose advice”
Macquarie is alleged to have arrived in
New South Wales, was not the former
Solicitor-General of England but a South
Sea whaler and trader! And one it
seemed, later, quite averse to paying his
just debts to his colonial representatives,
one of whom died a fugitive in con-
sequence.
This is not a solitary island of ridi-
culous error in a great book. If I had
space to play with, I could demonstrate
clearly to Professor La Nauze the falsity
of his dictum that Melbourne’s book
“leaves little more to be said”. A good
deal ‘more could be said about his treat-
ment of the Marshall case in Governor
King’s time. Still more could be said
about his ignorance of the mode and
technique of intercommunication
practised as between Governors and the
Colonial Office in the early days of
Australia.

One example in his statement, often
“parroted” by gleeful Leftist academic
historians, that (p. 23) while Lord
Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary, upheld,
as a matter of “expediency,” Governor
Macquarie and recalled the two judges
involved in the “Bent episodes” of 1815-
lb, “a sharp rebuke” to Macquarie
followed, the terms of which he quotes.
Others have, in consequence, quoted it
along with the Melburnian dictum.
A recourse to the very despatch from
which Melbourne draws his information
indicated by Editor Joyce's note
(HRA, Vol. 9/p. 107 ) —about the inci-
dent and about the “rebuke” shows what
weight may be placed on Melbourne's
say-so sometimes. For he fails to quote
Bathurst's words to Macquarie in that
despatch: “With your own conduct on
this occasion, His Royal Highness has
every reason to be satisfied, and with
no part of it more particularly than
your forbearance to exercise, in the case
of Messrs Bent, the power with which
you are vested, of immediately suspend-
ing in extreme cases the officers under
your command. I cannot avoid . . .
approving your discretion in not . . .
inflicting upon the Colony the suspen-
sion of all judicial proceedings ... I
derive much satisfaction from the addi-
tional assurance w'hich this conduct has
given me of your disposition, even under
circumstances of a most irritating nature,
to prefer the public service to your own
private convenience.” Yet ignoring all
this, Melbourne interprets the clarifica-
tion of the Colonial Office view as to
what might or might not be done —most
of the points made by Macquarie him-
self—as a sharp rebuke.
So much for historians certified by
professors as having said the “last word”
on Australian historical events.

LETTER FROM BRITAIN
Hacks and Dons
gAcK in 1953, John Wain, then an
unknown young university lecturer,
started producing for the BBC a monthly
radio programme called “First Reading,”
a kind of literary magazine of the air,
which included poems, stories, extracts
from novels, and critical pieces, by a
number of youngish writers, most of
whom .were unfamiliar to the public at
large. Kingsley Amis is perhaps the most
celebrated of them; an extract from
“Lucky Jim” was read in the first num-
ber of “First Readings”, and evoked a
rather sour response from critics; but a
few months later the novel was published
and was an immediate hit. The pro-
gramme aroused a response that had little
to do with the specific quality of its con-
tents. A long and angry correspondence
raged in the “New Statesman,” in the
course of which it became clear that a
whole new set of literary attitudes had
emerged: the new young writers were
no longer struggling aspirants in metro-
politan bohemia, or elegant gentlemen
safely backed by private incomes, but —
many of them —academics, often engaged
in teaching English Literature in provin-
cial universities; their prevalent tone
tended to be an ironic and assertive non-
conformity.
The established guardians of metro-
politan literary values disliked the new
writers for a number of reasons. For one
thing, they were socially declasse and
seemed to parade their brashness. They
were graduates in English Literature, a
subject-which has been generally derided
by older litterateurs, themselves safely
nurtured on history or the classics.
Throughout the summer of 1953 the de-
bate raged in the “New Statesman,” with
more energy than relevance, but the
division seemed clear: on the one
hand, the young “provincial dons”; on
the other, the smooth, self-assured metro-
politan men of letters. And in the course
of the correspondence the provincial
dons were made to seem rather ridiculous
—one of them even unwisely compared
his kind of professional concern with
literature with that of a sanitary inspector
examining the drains.
But now, over ten years later, the
literary scene and in particular the
world of reviewing and literary jour-
nalism has shown some significant
changes. The once-despised Eng. Lit.
dons have made a large-scale incursion
into the territory that was formerly the
undisputed preserve of the London liter-
ary gent.
Not all the traffic has been one way,
admittedly. Several writers who were
associated with “First Reading"’ and who
used to be academics are now full-time
writers John Wain himself, Kingsley
Amis and A. Alvarez. On the other
hand, the critic G. S. Fraser, who used
to adorn the London literary scene in the
early nineteen-fifties, has been since
1957 a lecturer in English at Leicester
University, and is currently a visiting
professor in America. Frank Kermode,
one of the most celebrated critics to have
emerged in the last few years, is also
Professor of English Literature at Man-
chester University; in addition to being
a formidably prolific literary journalist,
he is a Renaissance scholar of great
erudition. As a reviewer, Kermode is
both vigorous and learned; he sees the
books he is discussing in a wider per-
spective than the everyday reviewer,
tracing unexpected connections and con-
stantly placing works in the large and
continually developing history of the

Symbolist movement a topic which
he finds constantly fascinating (see his
critical book, “Romantic Image”). But
Kermode is prevented from getting bog-
ged down in his learning by the sheer
iconoclastic energy of his style, and his
refreshingly dismissive gestures. As, for
instance, in his remark in the course of
a brilliant though unfavorable study of
Robert Musil’s “The Man Without
Qualities”: “This may not seem an en-
ticing topic for a novel, and I myself,
though confident that another reading
would be very illuminating, have frankly
finished with this book for ever; but it
may be helpful anyway to abstract its
programme and set it baldly down.”
Kermode’s no-nonsense tone is very
typical of the new wave of (mostly aca-
demic) reviewers. Not earning a living
in the London literary rat-race, they can
afford to speak their minds without fear
of offending someone who might be use-
ful. This tone is evident in one of the
most entertaining of the younger re-
viewers, Christopher Ricks, a fellow of
Worcester College, Oxford. Ricks has a
very attentive ear and eye for the signi-
ficant minutiae of language, which were
used to excellent effect in his recent book
“Milton’s Grand Style”. He can be
extremely funny when he hooks on to
the more vulnerable qualities of language
in a contemporary novel or work of
criticism; he recently wrote in the “New
Statesman” a long and devastating analy-
sis of Sartre’s solemn book on Jean
Genet.
Some of the characteristic rigor of
the academic reviewers probably derives
from the influence of “Scrutiny”, whose
twenty-odd volumes were lately re-
printed by the Cambridge University
Press. Inside the universities, the
“Scrutiny” attitudes have produced an
often stultifying narrowness, but when
diffused in the laxer fields of metropoli-
tan literary journalism, their influence
seems to me beneficial. In literary
London the things that Leavis has at-
tacked in the past are still very evident;
notably the blatant log-rolling. This
was evident recently in the case of
Brigid Brophy's clever but thin novel,
“The Snow Ball”, which was acclaimed
in the “Sunday Times” by Iris Murdoch,
who is a close friend of Miss Brophy,
as one learnt from an unguarded gossip
writer.
Sometimes the production of literary
journalism combined with the pursual of
an academic career can produce a sense
of strain in someone who undertakes
both activities wholeheartedly. One
sees signs of this in John Gross, an
energetic young pluralist who combines
a fellowship in English at King’s Col-
lege, Cambridge, with being assistant
editor of “Encounter”. Mr Gross, as
a reviewer, shares many of the qualities
of people like Ricks and Kermode
vigor, learning, a measure of iconoclasm.
But I imagine that he is more drawn to
full-time journalism than either of them
(for anyone who can stand the life, the
financial rewards of journalism are likely
to be a good deal greater than those of
teaching). So far, however, he remains
rooted in Cambridge.
There are other names than those I
have mentioned; as, for instance, Donald
Davie, poet and critic, and recently
appointed Professor of Literature at the
new University of Essex; John Fuller,
another poet, now at Manchester Univer-
sity; and the novelists Malcolm Brad-
bury and David Lidge, both lecturers at
Birmingham.
This coming together of the worlds
of the universities and literary journalism
has, I think, done something to raise cri-
tical standards the academic reviewer,
provided he can write (a very large
proviso, admittedly), is likely to have a
more professional and disinterested ap-
proach. It also helps to integrate the
universities with the larger concerns of
society, something as desirable in the
arts as in the sciences.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A National Policy on Oil
It is good to note that agreement has been reached on the
sale of Moonie oil in Queensland, with Shell's undertaking
to buy 25 p.c. of Moonie oil at 2.83 dollars (about 255. 3d.
Aust.) a barrel. The Federal Minister for National Develop-
ment, Senator Sir William Spooner, knew what he was talking
about when he said agreement would be reached if everyone
kept calm.
There is no escalation clause to tie Australian oil to the
price of imports controlled by the big oil groups, and the price
now settled is subject to all refiners in Australia accepting
their share of Moonie production on identical terms. In case
there is any doubt about this, Sir William said, “I now expect
the other Australian refiners to accept their share of Moonie
crude on the same terms as Shell.” __
This might be called a case of wielding the big stick, with
the Australian Government holding the biggest stick. The oil
exploration industry would be in complete chaos if oil imports
could govern the price of locally produced crude, and it is
obvious that no government could permit such leverage.
Union-Kern-AOG, marketers of Moonie oil, did not escape
without some penalty, however. They are obliged currently
to meet the cost of outward harbor dues and wharfage in
Brisbane plus 30 cents freight allowance on all Moonie crude
not refined in Brisbane. But at least they have the satisfaction
of establishing a price on which they may cost their future
operations . . . which naturally assumes that other fields will
be brought in. In 15 months, of course, Moonie oil will be
refined in Brisbane and freight costs will be eliminated.
The Australian situation is nothing new, because oil pro-
duction cannot be dissociated from politics. The American oil
industry would never have survived against Middle East and
Venezuelan crude oil if the US Government had not insisted
on voluntary restraints in 1955, and imposed protective import
quotas from 1958. US production also is rationed and oil
must be purchased in equal proportions of capacity from all
producers.
Canada, similarly, has had to
develop a national oil policy to
protect its indigenous oil. A
prime example is the recent
decision to permit extraction of
tars and oil in Alberta at un-
economic levels (but limited to
5 p.c. of conventional crude
production). Alberta has diffi-
culty in competing with the
newer oil deposits of Saskatche-
wan and has been forced to
restrict its conventional oil pro-
duction within the limits of
market demand.
A decisive factor in this is
the control of oil in Saskatche-
wan by the major oil companies
who also dominate the refining
and marketing outlets. The oil
groups in Saskatchewan are permitted, under the pro-rated
system, to fill their own requirements from local production
before calling on the pro-rated supply from Alberta.
On a national scale, the Canadian Government has succeeded
in maintaining the production targets it set in 1961, of 600,000
barrels a day for 1961, 700,000 in 1962, and 800,000 in 1963.
The big .oil groups played ball with Canada and Washington
and it ended up that Venezuelan oil maintained a major share
of the market in Montreal (because of US worries over Vene-
zuela’s political problems). Middle East oil also was per-
mitted into Montreal provided the oil groups excluded all
imported oil from the Ontario market and that they permitted
Canada to export to the US in border areas.
The result has been a rising trend in Canadian production,
pro-rated to market demand. Looking beyond the current oil
surplus, the Alberta Government, which depends on oil and gas
production for almost half its income, has approved a 191 m.
dollar project by the Great Canadian-Sun Oil group to extract
45,000 barrels a day from the Athabasca tar oil sands by
1967. Imports could be brought in at a cheaper rate and
existing conventional production in Alberta is cheaper than
the projected tar oil sands project. But the national policy is
bent on developing local resources as well as maintaining in-
come. And this is what counts to the government of any
country.
Tighter Money in Japan
Slows Lending
HPighter monetary programmes are being lined up for more
A than one major industrial country at present, but Japan's
situation and policy must be of special interest to Australia.
The Japanese Government began to look very closely at busi-
ness and bank attitudes in the
late months of 1963.
Central bank requirements
from the commercial banks
were lifted on December 16
last. As one result the rate of
new lending in January slowed
up, though later months must
be more significant since Janu-
ary is a seasonably slack month
anyhow.
As from March 18, the Bank
of Japan lifted the official dis-
count rate from 5.84 to 6.57
p.c., aiming this move directly
at the balance -of - payments
situation. Low-interest policies
are in the discard.
Japanese business itself does
not yet give any evidence of


expressing a restrictive mood, for general liquidity remains
fairly high. However, if the growing trade deficit cannot be
brought into better equilibrium (and no short-term solution
seems possible), bank funds available for business loans may
be subject to a further pinch.
The present degree of tightness has clearly affected small
businesses, for bankruptcies have increased since January.
The Government has therefore provided loan funds totalling
£l5 million in an attempt to cushion the situation and the
Finance Ministry will probably use £12.5 million in buying
operations.
Prosperity By Order
of the President
TTnless there is a clear danger of inflation and a marked
deterioration in the US balance of payments, President
Johnson has assured businessmen he would do his best to see
that interest rates were kept down to enable a sufficient flow
of funds to finance private industry’s investment in new plant
this year.
This is taken as an underwriting agreement to ensure the
maintenance of business prosperity for 1964.
Statistics released during March show that US business
proposes to spend 10 p.c. more money on plant and equip-
ment in 1964. These expansion plans are interpreted in the
US as not only the result of the projected tax cut (now law)
but also a reflection of business confidence in the Johnson
Administration’s follow-up on its promise to maintain pros-
perity, at least until the elections this year.
Some members of the Federal Reserve Board have indica-
ted the time is ripe to tighten credit, lest inflation starts
cantering. The President evidently doesn’t see it that way,
and his action in reappointing Mr James Robertson to the
Federal Reserve Board is taken to indicate that the Adminis-
tration wants interest rates to remain low. Further, the
Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee in
Congress has more or less told the banking system that it
does not want to see the expansionary effect of the tax cuts
undermined by any sudden contraction of credit.
If the Reserve Board heeds this warning, the combined
effect of tax cuts and low interest rates could maintain pros-
perity until the elections, even at the expense of some inflation.
Wall Street evidently kept this well in mind when it broke
through the Dow Jones “800” barrier and pushed up near
the 820 mark for good measure before reacting.
Running Short
of Skilled Executives
Australia is in need of skilled artisans for many trades.
And, with the advance of electronics, the demand for
technical skill will increase.
Not as widely emphasised, however, is the increasing
demand for trained executives in management, accounting,
sales, research and manufacturing, apart from specialists in
advertising, transport, automation and . . . education.
A sadly neglected angle on this is the increased need for
experts who can teach. A world expert on electronics and
physics said recently that the child of tomorrow would need
to go to school forever and adults would need to go back
to school. It seems evident already.
The demands of specialisation do not permit much relaxa-
tion and the push-button age apparently requires not only
a team of experts to build the machines but another team
of experts to maintain the machines after they are built,
including feeding them data, repairing them, and planning
further cost-sharing techniques to offset rising wages.
Promotion techniques today have created new posts for
sales managers and research experts. The export drive in
most countries has stimulated a demand for export managers
and sales managers. Tariff experts and tax experts are being
wooed away from government employment.
To keep up with all the book work necessary under com-
pany law and tax law, the accountancy profession has en-
joyed a tremendous boom and, according to a UK analysis
of jobs advertised in 1963, the demand for accountants has
shown the greatest increase in executive jobs advertised in
the past five years.
This does not mean that all jobs advertised were filled.
The 36 p.c. rise in UK sales managers’ jobs in 1963 is
attributed to the sudden export drive and is not expected to
be sustained.
The UK survey says that 20 p.c. more executive jobs
were advertised in Britain last year. A similar situation is
evident in Australia with that queer bird “Young man under
25, honors degrees, 10 years’ commercial experience” no
longer in existence.
European Inflation Endangers
World Trade Prospects
classic early symptoms of inflation are becoming more
and more visible in several European countries and no
less so among members of the Common Market. Whatever
remedies the Six adopt do not only gain importance from
the standpoint of establishing internal stability.
For the current efflorescence of international trade con-
ferences must obviously be influenced by any concerted atti-
tude devised within the EEC. In particular, the sufficiently
imperilled GATT discussions, to start in May, could hardly
survive a position of heavier protection.
The EEC Commission has already urged its members to
tie fiscal and economic policies so that individual defensive
actions cannot unduly harm other members.
This mesage may now get a better reception at the Council
of Ministers’ meeting on April 13, where inflation is the
subject set down. The Commission’s main economic spokes-
man, Mr Robert Marjolin, has lately been trying to drive
the inflationary risks -home.
He told the European Parliament how costs of production,
prices and foreign trade were “going badly”. “We could
not let the European trade deficit develop much further,”
Mr Marjolin added in a New York speech.
Of course, experiences vary among the EEC nations. West
Germany continues to pile up record trade surpluses, Bel-
gium and Holland run in deficit. France manages to squeeze
a favorable balance, though the situation worsened through-
out 1963 and success of the stabilisation plan is not yet
assured.
Only last week Italy was rescued by international credits,
but devaluation is still being argued as a possible cure for
its payments trouble.
Europe seems to be shedding hitherto patent cost advant-
ages. Indeed, costs and prices appear destined to climb in
the face even of anti-inflationary moves already initiated.
The general labor shortage presses hard upon official wages
policies.
Chancellor Erhard fears inflation in other Common Market
countries as a threat to German stability. It is as much a
danger to world trade liberalisation.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Radical Proposals for Tax Reform
Painstaking study by four economists
Tt is high time we had a good, even if
*■ only potted, modern conspectus of
the structure of taxation in Australia.
So the authors of “Taxation in Austra-
lia Agenda for Reform”, published
by Melbourne University Press, are to
be congratulated for providing one as
a result of their painstaking study,
initiated in 1962, by the Social Science
Research Council of Australia.
Four University economists have put
their name to the published report —*
R. I. Downing, H. W. Arndt, A. H.
Boxer and R. L. Mathews. Each is
much respected in his own field. A
fifth, P. H. Karmel, took part early in
the inquiry but withdrew in February
last year on his appointment to the
Commonwealth Government’s Commit-
tee of Economic Enquiry.
Having said that, one should, at once
add that after 100 or so pages of
description and analysis of the taxation
structure which are well worth the price
of the book, the authors proceed to
weigh into questions of taxation reform
in a manner which will leave most
people breathless.
Last year The Bulletin was critical
of some of these proposals, notably that
to impose a tax on net worth and others
to bring more capital gains (but not by
a separate tax) into the Treasury and to
prevent certain tax avoidance practices.
The Bulletin's criticism was admit-
tedly based on brief exposition of the
proposals by Professor Downing. But
now, having studied the whole argument,
most of those criticisms still stand. The
only proviso is that some allowance
should be made for the strong equity
hormones of the authors and their very
frank admission that they justify some
of their proposals on the above scores
mainly on equity grounds and do not
pretend that the results in extra revenue
would be very substantial.
frankness doesn't put the authors
off their stroke one little bit, as is
testified by the following passage apro-
pos a tax on net worth, which the
authors prefer to the reintroduction of
differential taxation on property incomes
(which was abolished in 1953) —
“Even among those who are con-
vinced of the case in equity for differ-
ential taxation of property income or
for a supplementary tax on property,
there may be some who would hesitate
to recommend either, for fear of their
possible economic effects on enterprise,
risk-taking, saving, investment and
growth.
“While not prepared to accept the
view that such economic considerations
must always be given priority over
equity, we do not wish to belittle their
importance. Indeed, it is largely such
economic considerations that have led
us to prefer a tax on net worth to re-
storation of the former differential taxa-
tion of property incomes.”
Compared with an equivalent income
tax on property owners, the authors con-
sider a tax on net worth has several
economic advantages. For instance, they
say that to achieve a desirable degree of
progression in the tax structure by in-
come tax alone involves very high mar-
ginal rates of tax on the higher incomes,
with possibly detrimental effects on in-
centives; the addition of a tax on net
worth (with a fairly high exemption
limit for small properties) can achieve
the desired degree of progression with
lower marginal rates of income tax.
since a net worth tax falls
equally on all property, whether it
js invested productively or held in cash,
whether it is invested in risky or safe
assets, substitution of a wealth tax for
a progressive income tax favors pro-
ductive investment (relative to the hold-
ing of idle money balances or other
assets yielding little or no revenue) and
risk-taking. Furthermore, because a net
worth tax would not reach investment in
“human capital” it might be expected to
favor expenditure on education and
training.
They admit, however, that such a tax
would be difficult to administer. “That
a tax on net worth raises administrative
problems, especially difficulties of valua-
tion, cannot be denied.” they say. “But
that these problems are not insoluble,
or even very serious, is demonstrated by
the fact that such taxes have for many
decades been operated smoothly and
effectively by a considerable number of
countries, including Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland
and Western Germany.
“The administrative difficulties of a net
worth tax would seem to be substantially
less than those of a capital gains or
expenditure tax, if only because the last
two require valuation of the annual
increment, rather than the total stock,
of net worth.”
While it is not proposed that a sepa-
rate gains tax should be introduced it is
suggested that a new basis be introduced
for company taxation partly for this
purpose and also that extended use be
made of existing tax powers to widen
the net.
“We do not propose a separate capital
gains tax,” they say. “We wish to em-
phasise the fact that existing income
tax legislation already provides that pro-
perty transactions made with a view to
profit are trade deals, the profits from
which are assessable. Many land trans-
actions already attract this so-called
‘badge of trade’.
“We believe that the use of this power
should be greatly extended. At least the
company promoters, the ‘stags’ who
take up new share issues, and anyone
who by repeated or speculative dealing
in property adds regularly to his spend-
ing power should be brought to assess-
ment. Where, despite administrative
efforts, no satisfactory assessment can be
made, the Commissioner of Taxation
can fall back on his power to make de-
fault assessments a power he already
uses frequently, but which we believe he
should use more often whenever a tax-
payer’s way of life is inconsistent with
his returned income.”
from net worth and capital
gains, the authors explore several
other avenues for increasing taxation.
Starting with road-users, they would
regard an extra levy of a shilling on
petrol as “moderate”, saying that on
the basis of 1961-62 consumption this
would yield about £65 million extra
revenue but would still leave the Aus-
tralian price for petrol among the lowest
in the world.
They would also impose a ton-mile
charge on heavy transport in order to
meet the debt charges and maintenance
costs of the expensive roads needed for
such vehicles; they would make some
new highways toll-roads and also raise
city parking charges.
While these proposals break new
ground only in respect of the ton-mile
charge on heavy transport, those for
company taxation would completely
change the tax basis for companies.
They suggest that company income
tax should be reduced from its present
rates to a uniform rate of ss. in the £,
but there should then be imposed on
the undistributed profits of all companies,
private and others, a tax at a rate equal
to the highest marginal rate paid by


persons (at present 13s. 4d. in the £ less
5 p.c. rebate).
Thus companies would in effect be
“forced to submit all their profits to tax-
ation in the hands of their shareholders,
although they could still pre-empt funds
for their own expansion by paying some
of their dividends in the form of bonus
shares, which would be taxable in the
hands of shareholders, rather than in
cash. By this means, undistributed pro-
fits, which in the past have yielded in-
adequate taxes, would in effect be re-
placed by personal savings out of income
after tax.
“The only limitation on the existing
scope for companies to expand by re-
investing part of their profits would be
imposed by the reasonable insistence of
shareholders that such reinvestment
should be undertaken only when it is
justified by the prospective increase in
earnings.’’
HPhis scheme, the book holds, “would
combine some of the features of the
existing system of taxing private com-
panies in Australia with an equitable
method of taxing shareholders of all
companies. It would do away with the
need to distinguish between private and
non-private companies, but they would
receive offsetting advantages from the
general reduction in company tax rates
which our proposals would make pos-
sible.
“We emphasise the fact that our pro-
posals for taxing undistributed profits
are not intended to make it more diffi-
cult for companies to finance their ex-
pansion from internal sources. They
will be able to substitute bonus shares
for their present undistributed profits.
(If the aggregate yield of personal and
company income tax were maintained at
its present level, companies could distri-
bute dividends in the form of bonus
shares to compensate themselves fully
for the loss of retained profits, and still
leave shareholders in general with suffi-
cient additional cash dividends to meet
the extra tax for which they would be
liable as a class.)
“Our proposal goes further than this
in that we suggest rates which would
secure some increase in the aggregate
yield of personal and company income
taxes. This would be reflected in reduced
funds available to finance company
expansion and/or personal spending and
saving.
“Against this, there would, of course,
be an increase in tax revenue available
for increased government saving. We
are conscious of the fact that such addi-
tional taxation of company profits would
in some measure reduce the attractive-
ness of equity investment. So would
the introduction of capital gains taxa-
tion, to which our proposal is intended
as an alternative.”
“CROESUS”
The Marriage of Wool and
Synthetic Fibres
Lord Eccles says Wool Board’s ideas are wrong
TTaving recently been told by Mr A. J.
Burgess, chief executive director of
the Textile Council of Australia, that,
taking a ten-year view it is virtually
certain the use of woollen fabrics in
Japan is going to suffer at the hands of
man-made fibres, one was well pre-
pared to digest the views of another
synthetics man, Lord Eccles, a director
of Courtaulds (UK), who told an Insti-
tute of Directors’ luncheon in Mel-
bourne that the most promising future
for wool was in mixed marriages with
man-made fibres. Promoting pure-wool
fabrics alone on a quality image was a
policy of splendid isolation.
Lord Eccles said he couldn't speak for
New Zealand and Australian markets,
but he didn’t think the policy was right
for the changing conditions in world
markets for textiles. He was certain
that if one asked the retail trade for
their view, they would say that the de-
velopment of what was conveniently
called the wool-type fabric had gone too
far, and was now too widely apprecia-
ted by customers in all ranges of in-
come to be reversed by any promotion
campaign.
Nor was this change in demand a
flash in the pan, Lord Eccles said. The
textile industry recognised that it was
having to adjust its structure in a big
way to handle the new fibres and
fabrics. Up to quite recently, the in-
dustry was divided into distinct and
separate sections - three old-timers,
cotton, wool and silk, and one new-
comer, man-made fibres.
But now in Britain, and in all indus-
trialised countries, the various sections
were all merging one into the other.
Today natural and man-made fibres
were both to be found on looms and
knitting machines as the rule, not the
exception.
Lord Eccles thought moves in recent
years toward a few large mixed vertical
combines in the textile industry were
by no means complete. As the out-
ward and visible sign of what was hap-
pening, an effort was now being made
• and Britain had lagged behind what
textile manufacturers had done in Aus-
tralia to form a single British Tex-
tile Association covering all the sepa-
rate sections of the industry.
The British Government was backing
this proposal because it wants to see
one organisation speaking for all tex-
tiles at all stages of production, and
promoting research and development in
all fibres with emphasis on the common
interests of the old and the new.
A ll this pressure to integrate the in-
dustry started from the demands of
the customer, he said. In all continents,
the multi-millions of buyers were be-
coming better educated, better off, and
more insistent on fabrics which were
attractively designed, easy to handle
and wash and, most important, reason-
able in price.
“What kind of fabrics measure up
to the requirements of the affluent
society?'’ he asked. “I do not need to
tell you that these fabrics are largely
mixtures of natural and man-made
fibres, or that the most expensive dress-
houses call for them as readily as Marks
and Spencer and Woolworths.
“In some ways the move towards
blended fabrics is even stronger in
household textiles. Living standards are
rising sharply. The number of new
homes built seems to increase pretty
well everywhere. In this field I take
carpets as an example, both because of
the volume of fibres they require and
because of their importance as status
symbols.
“Not long ago, if you went into the
home of the English wage-earner, you
would have found a rug in the parlor,
linoleum in the best bedroom and bare
boards in the other rooms. Today,
young couples setting up their home
want carpets throughout the house.
“But what sort of carpets can they
afford? Not the best quality pure-wool.
The price is beyond their means. They
are looking for something equally ro-
bust but cheaper, and they will find it
in mixtures of wool and man-made
fibres.
“I know that carpet-wool is of greater
interest to New Zealand than Austra-
lia, but surely all wool-growers would
prefer to see the millions of new homes
in the colder climates with carpets in
which there is some wool rather than
with no carpets at all? This seems a
striking, and by no means unique,
example of how the combination of
wool and man-made fibres can enlarge
the market for both.

“The latest statistics for the con-
sumption of all fibres give some idea of
what wool might do in alliance with
other fibres. Taking the whole world,
including the Communist countries, the
annual consumption (in thousand mil-
lion lbs) during the period 1960 to
1962 was: Cotton, nearly 23; man-
made fibres, 8: and raw wool 3. In
other words, wool secured only one
pound out of 11 consumed.
“It follows,” said Lord Eccles, “that
if, through the spread of wool-type
fabrics, only a small additional share
of the total market can be gained, the
effect on the volume of wool required
would be substantial. In my view this
seems a much better prospect than
plugging away at pure-wool fabrics.”
the Soviet and Chinese
blocs, Courtaulds has estimated that
world annual growth in the demand for
wool-type fabrics will be 3 p.c. cumu-
lative, and of the fibres required
to match this rate of growth, the
annual increase in wool will be about
If p.c. and in synthetics 7 p.c.
Lord Eccles said that if this forecast
was near the mark, it would mean that
the share of the free-world market for
wool and synthetics going to wool would
fall over the period from 60 to 55
p.c. while the share of synthetics would
rise from 14 to 21 p.c., the balance
being accounted for by re-used wool
and other materials.
However, the free-world would be
consuming a greater volume of wool
each year, he said. The forecast point-
ed to a rise in the consumption of wool
by the free-world from the present
figure of 2.5 thousand million pounds
to 2.9 thousand million pounds in 1970.
This increase would be greater than the
average 1 } p.c. annual rise for the last
50 years. In making such long-term
estimates one had to assume that the
difference in price between wool and
synthetics would remain more or less
what it was now. but synthetics were
more likely to fall than rise, and, if so,
the market for mixtures should benefit.
In short, Lord Eccles thinks the
world is becoming more and more in-
terested in mixtures of natural and
man-made fibres, an all-purpose textile
industry is on the way, and within it
the trend is towards vertical integra-
tion into a relatively small number of
large multi-fibre textile corporations.
Moreover, he says this is a revolution-
ary process, and it is one that wool-
growers should go along with.
“Speaking for myself,” he added, “I
am firmly convinced that the old and
the new fibres will do best as allies
rather than as rivals. I know the wool
boards do not believe this, but I think
events will prove them wrong.”
Plastics—A Bounding Industry
Severe competition contains costs
As a relatively young Australian industry plastics has expanded from
what was once almost a novelty to its present position of a highly developed
necessity. Executives whom The Bulletin interviewed last week said the
uses of plastics had hardly been touched and that the annual growth rate
of more than 16 p.c. would continue for the next 10 to 15 years.
The industry has its share of problems not the least of which is stiff
internal competition, caused to a large degree by excess capacity. Com-
panies in the field expect a bright future from the increased use of plastics
by the building and packaging industries.
HThe plastics industry has expanded
rapidly in recent years and in-
dications are that it will continue.
Federal election promises on building
give manufacturers just cause for their
optimism and general increases in the
use of plastics in Australia support their
feelings.
Figures from the Commonwealth
Statistician bear out theories that the
industry is expanding generally at more
than 10 p.c. a year. The use of plastics
for moulding and extrusion alone has
grown from 567,600 cwt in 1960-61
through 810,300 cwt in 1961-62 to
950,900 cwt in the last financial year.
In the three months to December,
1963, the production of extrudable and
mouldable plastics stood at 279,350 cwt
compared with the previous correspond-
ing period’s output of 229,520 cwt.
Growth since recovery from the credit
squeeze has been substantial, and the
annual increases indicate not only a
healthier industry but a general Aus-
tralian awareness of the use and value
of plastics.
Mr Frank Ashworth, secretary of the
NSW section of the Plastics Institute of
Australia, said the industry was expand-
ing “at about 16 p.c. a year”. He said
imports gave it some competition but
only where cheap materials were being
used. “It is not as serious as it was some
years ago when the industry was really
establishing itself and had to contend
with the imported fully finished product,
“Since 1945 the plastics industry has
expanded twenty-fold. In the last few
years it has shown this high growth rate,
about double that of the gross national
product. There was a slight hesitancy
or faltering during the credit squeeze but
since then it has gone up again.
“Imports of the finished product are
not a serious problem for us at all. As a
rule the local manufacturer tends to buy
local materials because of the efficiency
of the local industry and the cost of the
foreign product coupled with the pro-
tective tariff placed upon it is prohibitive,
“The growth of the plastics industry is
about twice as hjgh as the expansion in
the gross national product and it looks


as though this trend will continue because
there are a. lot of things we haven’t
touched yet. We have projects on the
list for the next three years or so which
will increase the use of plastics in Aus-
tralia.
“Internal competition is very tough
and everybody is screaming there is not
enough profit margin in the industry.
This has been caused partly by over-
capacity. It has been suffering from this
since 1960 although now it has become
more stabilised and has settled to a com-
fortable degree. The plastics industry is
basically tied up with the economy
especially with building and consumer
durables. While we depend on them
they depend on us. There has been a big
improvement in the industry in the last
12 months or so.
“The improvement in profit
margins and stabilising of com-
petition will continue for the
next 12 months but it will not
be a total improvement. Because
it is so easy to get into the
industry competition has been
severe in the past. Machine
manufacturers are only too
happy to assist. And quite a
few big end users of our pro-
ducts have put in their own
plant. They have found them-
selves very sorry for it after-
wards.”
Mr Ashworth said the cost
structure of the industry had
not changed very much over the
past few years. “Raw materials
have gone down in accordance
with the general world trend.
Because of this and the general
increase in volume the cost to
consumers of many lines has
remained steady over the past
ten years. A basic wage in-
crease could have an adverse
effect on our costs.”
In the early stages of development of
the plastics industry in Australia the bulk
of overseas investment came from the
United Kingdom. Since 1955 the major
source of investment capital has been the
United States. There has also been some
German investment in the industry.
One of the benefits of overseas interests
is the rapid dissemination of “know
how”. Australian research in plastics is
relatively small, Mr Ashworth said, as
companies here rely on big research
programmes undertaken by overseas
firms for technological advances and de-
velopments.
More than 80 p.c. of Australian re-
quirements are now obtained from local
sources and with the exception of
acrylics, resins, nylon and high density
polyethylene, most of the more import-
ant plastic materials are produced locally.
Mr Ashworth said the plastics industry
was looking to building and packaging as
major markets for its products-
“At the present time,” he said, “plastics
account for probably no more than 10
p.c. of all materials used in packaging.
However, the growth of the use of
plastics in packaging is ten times greater
than that of any other material. For
instance the use of paperboard in packag-
ing increased about 25 p.c. in the ’sos
while the growth of plastics for packag-
ing was more than 300 p.c.
“In the use of plastics in building I
think Australia will follow pretty closely
trends in the US. Dr A. G. H. Dietz,
Professor of Building Engineering and
Director of Plastics Research at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
said recently: ‘Building construction in
the US is estimated to consume about
This graph, using information from the Commonwealth
Statistician, shows production in Australia of plastics for
extrusion and moulding.
20 p.c. of all plastics produced in the
States. Although this is only one p.c.
or less of the total spent on construction,
the diversity of applications in building
and the rate of increase is generating
deep interest among architects and
builders. There will be a greater use of
plastics in building by 1970. Some fore-
casts claim that 30 p.c. of all building
materials will be plastic-based by that
time’.”
An executive of ICIANZ Ltd plastics
division said plastics in Australia would
continue to grow spectacularly for the
next ten or 15 years. It would then
maintain itself at a more or less constant
level. “The industry is very young in
Australia,” he said. “If we assume that
it is only 30 years old, since it wasn’t
really well established until the ’3os,
then growth has been remarkable and
will continue to be so.”
ICIANZ supplies only the raw
materials and does not mould or extrude
plastics.
The executive continued: “Probably
the greatest fields for development and
growth are packaging and building. The
building industry offers the most spec-
tacular possibilities for plastics. It has
hardly been touched and it was only
recently that we made any headway with
architects, builders and building material
suppliers.
“Plastic packaging in the past has been
confined mainly to polyethylene film and
squeeze bottles, but developments in
other forms of containers will mean an
increase in this field. In the next 12
months heavy duty containers with
capacities of up to 100 gallons will come
to Australia.”
The executive said that at , times
ICIANZ faced “vicious” com-
petition from overseas. It came
in two forms—one, where the
raw material was dumped on
Australian markets by a country
which overproduced, and,
secondly, from the finished
goods.
“The use of plastics ini the
industrial field has expanded
immensely. There is an enor-
mous usage of nylon, acrylics,
polycarbonates and other
plastics at present. The use of
these materials has probably
expanded by 100 p.c. over the
past five years. The growth
rate of industrial plastics is
almost frightening,” the execu-
tive added.
An executive of a large
plastics fabricating company
said his sales and production
for this time of year were
in line with results for last
year.
“We have faced severe com-
petition during the year, and
this has held results down,” he said.
“The industry is very competitive due
to the large amount of machinery in use
and the good prospects.
“Due to competition in recent years
prices have gone down. But reduced
prices to the consumer have been helped
by reduced raw material prices because
of the larger volume of production. The
number of people in the field has in-
creased, as has the type of machinery
employed.
“The cost of materials has shown a
downward trend but there are indications
that costs will rise because of longer
holidays and increased wages and I doubt
if the industry will be able to produce at
the present prices. However, higher
costs will only be marginal.”
The executive said the future of the
Australian plastics industry was in line
with that overseas. The industry couldn’t
help but grow and grow quickly.


MARKET POINTERS
Coal Has Its Problems
An increased rate of crude oil refining
** in Australia, to meet the heavily
rising demand for petrol, has left in its
wake a serious problem for coal pro-
ducers.
Residual products from refining,
notably fuel oil, are becoming avail-
able at cheap rates. Propane gas and
butane can be supplied in bulk at prices
which the coal companies can’t match.
And, as the rate of refining increases,
the surplus fuel oil must become even
cheaper.
The AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT
CO. is sitting pretty in the middle of
this situation because it can play one
against the other.
Undoubtedly it must have the coal
producers worried, because in a period
of rising population and increased users
of gas, coal’s share of the gas generated
for Australian towns has dropped from
90 p.c. in 1948 to 53 p.c. in 1963. Coal
usage in that period fell by 154,000
tons to 401,000 tons.
Coal has been through many troubles
in the past and has been reprieved by
such things as the sudden lift in black
coal exports to Japan. But this applies
only to special types of black coal. Even
traditional markets like the railways have
been switching from coal to diesel.
And now, on the horizon, loom pros-
pects of natural gas expansion in Aus-
tralia.
Australian Gas Light Co. is in a strong
position but it is difficult to become
unduly enthusiastic about capital appre-
ciation for its shares and market con-
siderations would be directed more to
the 6 p.c. dividend yield offering.
On the other hand, the gloomier
picture painted for coal companies could
depress the prices of coal shares too
low. Politically, State Governments are
not anxious to see a shutdown of coal
mines, but economics eventually may
force some out of business. In that
event, break-up values (if promptly
effected) could represent some consola-
tion to shareholders.
the hot weather continued it
was worth recalling that bleak
period of early 1963, when it rained
incessantly and the soft drink sellers
missed out on plenty of sales.
SHELLEYS, actively promoted in
Sydney, must be doing well, and the
market evidently believes so because it
is pricing the ss. shares at around
14s. 10d. to yield 4.2 p.c.
It is not a good policy to come in
on a share after it has enjoyed a strong
rise, but perhaps there is still something
left if sales figures live up to expecta-
tions.
★ ★ ★
A SOFT drink manufacturer down from
the boom pedestal is TARAX of
Melbourne, which had a meteoric rise
to 275. 3d. in 1962.
In more sober vein, the ss. shares
are now close to double par value to
offer a yield of nearly 5 p.c.
Tarax has had its difficulties in
attempting to break into the tough Syd-
ney market and also received stiff com-
petition in Melbourne from Marchants
(currently having its share of trouble).
Considering that this company was
able to pay a 20 p.c. dividend from a
33 p.c. earning rate a couple of years
ago, the current situation may indicate
some prospect of recovery.
Earning rate when last reported was
12.9 p.c. and didn't provide much cover
for the 10 p.c. dividend, but sales are
reported to be rising.
The market, once bitten, may not be
too hasty in boosting the shares, but
there could be an improvement in price
by the time the annual results roll round.

17ERTILISER shares continue to get a
plug because of the big expansion
plans ahead.
ACF and SHIRLEYS FERTILISERS
LTD has announced a further £3m.
expansion programme, which apparently
raises its total capital programme to a
very high level over the next few years.
Major item will be the £3im. ammonia
fertiliser plant at Pinkenbct, near Bris-
bane, in which ICIANZ will put up
about £T\m. in a company to be formed,
Ammonia Co. of Queensland Pty. Ltd.
ACF and Shirleys is not widely known
on the official stock exchange lists and
it is only recently that the company
blushingly appeared from the Brisbane
Stock Exchange unofficial list and spread
its wings to other Stales, thus per-
mitting wider shareholder assistance in
any capital expansion.
The market already pays a high price
for the 20s. shares at 795. and those
gambling on a new issue must consider
the size of the premium likely to be
imposed.
Fertiliser shares have proved an attrac-
tive investment and ACF should con-
tinue to gain admirers. But it would
be nice to know how all that hefty
capital will be raised before getting too
enthusiastic.

A couple of Melbourne stockbrokers
have suggested an investment in
OLIVER DAVEY GLASS INDUS-
TRIES. A holding would provide an
interest in the building industry and
also give a high dividend yield of 6.7 p.c.
on the present price of 7s. 6d.
The company is Victoria’s largest
public glass merchant and is highly re-
garded in the trade, especially now that
many sources have eliminated any blame
which rested on the group over the fall-
ing glass in the ICI building at the top
end of town.
The building industry is still highly
active so earnings in the current year to
March 31 should provide an improved
cover for the dividend which has been
held at 10 p.c. since listing in 1958.
★ ★ ★
TI/TSTRALIAN OIL shares look in-
teresting at 2s. 7d. They are fully
paid to 2s. The company is now a large
producer of mineral sands, most income
being from ilmenite which has a very
firm world price at present. Moreover,
all ilmenite production has already been
sold to British Titan Products under a
long-term agreement.
Add to this factor the increased sales
of leucoxene and the commencement of
royalties soon from a one-third interest
in Western Mineral Sands Pty Ltd
(which has finished a new plant for the
treatment of deposits at Capel in WA)
and one must conclude that profit this
year will be much better than the
£102,000 of 1962-63.

"WThile the market dithers and eases
” back some of the shrewdies look
around for tightly held stocks which may
be prised loose. One of these is COM-
MONWEALTH INDUSTRIAL GASES,
whose 20s. shares sell at around the
£5 mark. Sounds like rich fare, but
brokerage is cheaper at these “big” share
prices and this is a company which has
a solid record. Even if the general
market comes down, it’s one of those
shares to lock away, disregarding the
poor yield.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Making the Most of Inflation
The case of the LTFI investor
A Melbourne stockbroking firm has
recently given sound advice regard-
ing investment in the event of the cur-
rent buoyancy engulfing the Australian
economic scene and leading to inflation,
the curse of all fixed-interest investors,
especially long-term ones.
The last time Australia saw such pros-
perous conditions was in 1960. Many
new long-term fixed interest investors
entered the market and numerous existing
holders extended their interests. It is true
that the real value of most LTFI securities
did not suffer because the credit squeeze
promptly halted an inflationary spiral.
However, the credit squeeze was often
the catalyst which hastened the collapse
of Reid Murray, Stanhill, etc., and re-
duced or completely eliminated the money
value of LTFI holdings—a much worse
fate than a simple loss of purchasing
power.
We refer to the squeeze as the cata-
lyst rather than the cause of many com-
pany failures because several authorities
have since pointed out that the firms
concerned were financially weak and un-
balanced anyway, and collapse would
have eventually doomed them under
almost any circumstances.
Getting back to the broker's argument,
we find that the overriding principle is
the maintenance of some sort of balance
between shares and LTFI stocks. The
ratio must, of course, vary according to
individual requirements. But the firm em-
phasises that if more than half of a port-
folio already comprises LTFI securities
then it would be unwise to increase com-
mitments in this direction.
Two reasons are given for holding
this opinion. First, is the relatively low
interest rates on first-class long-term de-
benture stock of around 6 p.c.—eight or
nine months ago, such investments were
offering 8 p.c. Thus, if interest rates
should recover, holders will be faced
with a below par market price if they
wish to realise before maturity.
The second reason has already been
indicated that inflation could reduce
the purchasing power of LTFI securities.
Australia’s long-term price history has
shown an average inflation rate of about
2i p.c. a year. Cost levels have been
virtually static for three years and the
present economic indicators show that
over the next year or so we may rejoin
the long-term average.
Now, assuming inflation returns at H
p.c., the current 6 p.c. interest rates
would actually give only a 31 p.c. return
on every £lOO invested. This is very poor.
The return would probably be less be-
cause, first, tax is payable on the 6 p.c.
and, second, it is quite possible the 2+
p.c. inflation is an understatement be-
cause cost levels have three years (during
which very small increases were re-
corded) to catch up on.
So, if LTFI investment is going to
prove no more lucrative than a bank
balance, only shares are left as a means
of preserving the value of one’s capital.
On this argument the investor’s main
problem is to select appropriate equity
shares to ride the inflation.
This particular broker suggested nine
sound equitv shares which covered a
wide range of commercial and industrial
fields and showed dividend yields of be-
tween 41 and 51 p.c. on the market.
Brokers, investment advisers, analysts
and the normal investor all have an in-
exhaustible supply of suggestions. Some
will prove successful, some won’t. The
choice is up to each individual according
to the exact nature of his own require-
ments.
Marrickville Moves Ahead
of Marrickville Holdings
Ltd, Sydney food processor, are
satisfied with profit for the first half of
the current June year.
Sales have been maintained, they say.
Kinkara tea and Mother’s Choice flour,
products of the relatively new subsidiary,
J. R. Love Pty, have been introduced to
the Victorian market.
Abels Industries Ltd and Eta Foods
Ltd, NZ companies in which Marrickville
has considerable investments, continued
to produce “excellent” results.
The 15 p.c. dividend (interim 74 p.c.)
this year requires £433,473, compared
with last year's £419,455. The capital
was increased by the issue of £148,435
in connection with the J. R. Love take-
over, and £209,959 for the controver-
sial takeover of Olympic Bowling Centres
Ltd in 1962-63.
The factory at Triabunna (Tas.) for
the production of alginates from sea-
weed, is almost completed. These are
used as thickening, gelling and stabilis-
ing agents in toothpaste and food pro-
ducts, and to date have been solely im-
ported to this country.
It is suggested that even if this years
earnings in relation to capital are not
spectacular, some return from the
alginate investment in 1964-65 should
improve the position.
Electronic’s Dim Future
the annual meeting of Electronic
Industries last November, Sir Arthur
Warner, chairman, strongly defended the
company’s policy of maintaining the 12i
p.c. dividend rate although earnings had
not covered it for three years. He said
this was a bold outlook, but he believed
that certain reserves should be used,
within “reasonable limits”, to maintain
dividends.
Apparently the heavy drop in profit
from £423,000 to £328,000 in the
December half-year has been sufficient
to reduce this boldness the interim
dividend has been lowered from 6£ to
5 p.c., indicating an annual 10 p.c. This
move was made “in order to leave a
margin between dividends and profits.”
On present indications, this margin is
going to be very narrow, if it exists at
all, by the end of the year. The six
months’ profit equalled only 5.8 p.c. on
capital. The group will have to pul! off a
miracle to maintain this rate in the
second half profits for electrical appli-
ance manufacturers usually ease substan-
tially in comparison as the first half is
boosted by winter television business and
the Christmas trade in refrigerators and
radios.
If Electronic’s 1962-63 year is any indi-
cation, profit in the second term was
£213,000, virtually half the £423,000
made in the first six months.
So it is a fairly safe bet that the
full term's earning rate will not cover
the indicated 10 p.c. dividend and
another call on reserves may be necessary
to_ finance such a distribution. The infor-
mative interim report from directors
unfortunately made no concrete refer-
ence to prospects in the current
six months except to say that they
appeared satisfactory.
The Essence is Growth
Tnterim report of record turnover and
improved earnings for the December
six months should have given fresh
flavor to the ss. shares of Keith Harris
and Co. Ltd.
Instead they actually eased from
365. 6d., paid early in March, to 355.
This is still 2s. 3d. above last year's
peak of 325. 9d.
This Sydney flavoring specialist and
essential oil distiller, manufacturing
chemist and importer has one of the
most impressive growth records on the
market. In the last decade, shareholders

Profits have trebled in that period to
£lOl,OOO, with the assistance of
Jusfrute Ltd of Gosford, which was
acquired in 1960. John Rollinson Pty,
a Melbourne perfumery compounder,
was taken over in July, 1963.
The company alsc made a premium
share issue in 1960 to Firmenich et Cie,
for whom it is sole distributor in Aus-
tralia.
Directors advised that Jusfrute earned
record profit from record sales in the
first half of the current year, and the
results of John Rollinson were satisfac-
tory and showed improvement.
The 171 p.c. dividend is continued for
the third successive year with an interim
payment of 81 p.c.
James Bell Doing Well
Tames Bell, dairy and food machinery
** manufacturer, will undoubtedly earn
a much bigger profit this year. The
interim report last week spoke of record
sales, satisfactory profit increases and
substantial orders on hand.
Last year, dividends were resumed at
8 p.c. after a profit move from £48,000
to £53,000. The previous payout was
way back in 1958-59. Last week’s report
declared a steady 4 p.c. interim distribu-
tion.
If this year is as successful as antici-
pated, then the earning rate will go well
above 1963’s 15.5 p.c. This would pro-
vide adequate scope for an increased 10
p.c. dividend. The company has been
installing its milk processing and re-
frigeration plant in a new factory at
Broadmeadows (Vic.) for Metropolitan
Industries. Contracts with Monash Uni-
versity, the Adelaide Children’s Hospital
and the ES&A Bank have proved profit-
able.
Benefits should also be rolling in from
last year’s heavy expenditure on the
creation of export markets. In the 1963
annual report, directors said that sub-
stantial orders were in hand to make
equipment for projects in Bangkok,
Manila and Singapore.
Emu Bonus a Prospect?
income return of 2.3 p.c. and earn-
ings yield of 5.5 p.c. would be justi-
fied for Emu and Prospect Gravel and
Road Metal Co. Ltd only if a bonus was
just around the corner.
Last year’s earning rate of 41.6 p.c. is
enough to dazzle any investor tempor-
arily, but he should not be blinded. Entry
now at £7 10s. Od. could bring only slow
reward.
It is four and a half years since the
last issue of free scrip—one-for-three—•
in which period earnings have averaged
34.9 p.c. Dividends accounted for about
half of those earnings.
Sales and net profit for the first half of
this year compare very well with the
previous corresponding period, so share-
holders can confidently expect an increase
over last year's earning rate.
Duncan in the Black again
HThere ought to be a couple of shillings
in Duncan’s Holdings 10s. shares
purchased at around 7s. if the prospec-
tive buyer is prepared to accept a little
risk over the next six months.
The company has announced a respec-
table pre-tax profit of £50,967 for the
December half of 1963-64, and all the
pointers are right for the second half-
term.
After omitting dividend altogether
when a loss of £30,770 was incurred for
1962-63, directors are showing admirable
care in reserving dividend considerations
until results for the whole of the cur-
rent year are to hand.
A 6 p.c. final equal to the total
payments for each of the three years
to June 30, 1962 is a reasonable
expectation.
Souuerclale Stops Rot
After three years of trading deficits,
Sonnerdale, now incorporating
Richardson David Brown Gears, has
stopped the rot with a profit for the
December half-year.
It was specified as over £50,000 after
tax, which compares with last year’s
loss of £8,584 and the last recorded
profit of £81,246 for the full year 1959-
60.
Preference dividend payments have
been upheld throughout the three-year
troubles but ordinary shareholders have
had nothing since a 4 p.c. interim in
May, 1961.
The share market could respond more
readily to the cheery interim news. The
10s. shares were still obtainable at Is. 6d.
below par after the public was informed
that sales were up 29 p.c., all subsidiaries
were profitable and the inflow of new
business was satisfactory.
Apparently investors will be guarded
about buying in until an ordinary divi-
dend is declared.
Set for a Flying Start
TV’s transmission date has
been delayed for about six weeks
until the end of May. Shareholders
should not be concerned, however, as
the board has made a smart move to
offset the additional expenses. Funds
have been favorably invested and the
interest from these will cover the bulk
of any extra expense.
AMV-4 will be getting away to a flying
start when transmission commences. To
date expenses have been maintained at
or close to budget levels. Moreover, the
initial operating hours will total 43 a
week instead of the 30 originally plan-
ned. This figure far exceeds that of any
other commercial station on its opening
weeks.
Small Mercies
T ife is still far from easy for Petro-
chemical Holdings Ltd, which was
able to report only a slight increase in
group net profit for the December six
months.
Shareholders, however, are thankful
for small mercies, and the 20s. units
sold Is. higher at 235. 6d. The new
yield on a 6 p.c. dividend is a doubt-
ful-looking 5.1 p.c.
Felt’s Swiss Link
Thirst inkling of what Felt and Textiles
of Australia Ltd will do with some
of the £2.4 million in kitty since the
sale of South African interests was given
last week.
Together with Jacob Rohner A.G. of
Switzerland, the largest embroidery
company in the world, Felts will form
Jacob Rohner (Aust.) Pty Ltd, with ini-
tial paid capital of £350,000.
Felts already has an embroidery divi-
sion which made embroidered piecegoods,
broderie anglaise, badges, titles and
motifs, as well as trims and poms for
slippers.
The company had found overseas


£799 new.

How much used?
V W 1662
When you're buying anew car,
think about selling it.
The actual price of a car isn’t what you pay
for it. It’s what you pay, less the money you
get back when you sell.
Which usually makes the VW’s real price
much lower than any other car.
Why?
A middle-aged VW is generally in much
better shape than other cars of the same
age.
The low-revving engine isn’t packing up.
The gears aren’t crunching.
The shape isn’t obsolete.
The body isn’t failing apart.
(It isn’t old, only experienced.)
As a used car, it still has a future as long
as the whole life of most cars.
Think ahead.
Think of all those thousands of miles of
lively, reliable, go-anywhere
driving while you own it, and a
big cash bonus when you sell.

competition heavy in the embroidery

report voiced the need for higher tariff
protection.

The ss. shares have eased about 6d.
to Bs. 6d. (yielding 5.8 p.c.) over the last
month since publication of the results
for the first half of the year.
Better Year, But . . .
A p.c. dividend from General In-
dustries Ltd after two years’
omission generated an immediate rise of
only a shilling to 11s. 3d. The 20s.
shares had plunged to Bs. 7d. after news
of the disastrous fire in February.
After a loss of unknown proportions
in the first half, a profit of £170,517
was registered for the year to February
29. This represents 3.3 p.c. on ordinary
capital.
The strong upsurge in earnings
suggested by this result might encourage
the investor of short memory to be much
impressed, but shareholders have had
many disappointments since the stunning
loss of £489,220 in 1960-61.
Directors declare that the fire was
mainly in the refrigeration and air-con-
ditioning divisions, and that reconstruc-
tion is now under way.
The dislocation of these sections could
be sufficient to release General In- 1
dustries’ tentative grasp of profitability.
It could be a long time yet before the
stock deserves a par valuation.
Good Year for Commodore?

Those that do often end up in trouble
‘.Commodore Motels is an exception.
In 1962-63 9 p.c., instead of the pre
dieted 8 p.c., was distributed from £
14 p.c. earning rate equal to £41,929
The result was subject to heavy estab
lishment expenses and earned from si?
motels in Victoria, only three of w'hicl
operated for the full year.
Five units will operate for the fulj
1963-64 year as the interest in the Gee
long one has been sold at a capital pro !
fit. A hotel-motel was opened iij
Warrnambool early in the term am
another will be operating at Sheppartoi
before the term closes. Soon after, tfo

In addition, negotiations are proceeding
for two further sites said to be “strate;

pect a big improvement in results for a!
least this year and 1964-65.

12 Sullivan Street, MOORABBIN, 5.20, Victoria, Australia
a six-month profit of £30,071 and a 5 p.c.
interim payout indicating 10 p.c. for the
full year. The figure which equalled
20.05 p.c. on capital does not include the
profit of the Geelong sale.
Commodore is well placed to share
in any increased patronage and seeing
the shares are currently yielding 6 p.c.
around the market price of Bs. 6d., they
should prove valuable buying.
Publicity Too Good
TTnique amongst listed companies as a
personal service organisation, Eric
White Associates Ltd, public relations
consultant, makes its debut with an
interim dividend of 8! p.c.
Directors declined to reveal actual
profit for the December six months as
this could be misleading, but they do
hazard the opinion that 1963-64 earnings
will exceed last year’s £31,915.
The indicated 16! p.c. dividend could,
therefore, be covered by a margin of
about 100 p.c.
The ss. shares, floated in January at
7s. 9d., touched 16s. 4d. briefly before
the interim report was published.
That price put them on a 5.0 p.c.
yield, which is slight for a company so
dependent on goodwill alone. A higher
return should be required from this stock
than from a company with greater fixed
assets.
D. Primer Improves Earnings
Tnterim news from Dickson Primer
(Consolidated) Ltd, Sydney building
materials and machinery distributor, of
greater demand and higher earnings was
not unexpected.
Investors are more concerned about
the state of the earning rate. Last year
the capital was increased by a one-for-
four issue and a notes conversion, which
did not rank for dividend for the whole
year.
Even so, despite an absolute profit rise
in 1962-63, earning rate slipped from
20.1 to 15.6 p.c., and dividend w'as fined
down from 15 to 13 p.c.
Some rationalisation is taking place
in the group. This should have a
beneficial effect on current earnings.
The ss. shares at 11s. 3d. yield 5.8
p.c. with modest dividend cover, but
even so are not excessively priced. In
fact, there could be some medium-term
gains for current purchasers.
Tugboat Owner Prospers
the shipping industry
generally is not a highly profitable
one in Australian waters, Fenwick Flold-
ings Ltd, Sydney tugboat owner, is a
notable exception.
It operates a fleet of well-maintained
tugs in Sydney, Botany Bay, Newcastle
and Port Kembla.
Amongst the £563,714 reserves
supporting paid capital of £400,000 at
June 30, 1963, was £200,000 in a
reserve for increased cost of fleet re-
placement.
Incorporated as a proprietary com-
pany in 1916, Fenwick went public six
years ago and in that short period has
increased earnings from £48,000 to
£106,000.
Shareholders have had two premium
issues and a bonus, and now directors
have lifted the dividend rate for 1963-64
to 121 p.c. with an interim 6! p.c. for
the half-year to December. This restores
the rate prevailing before the cash and
bonus issues of 1961-62.
Sound advance on last year's earning
rate of 26.4 p.c. can be expected for the
current year.
At 20s. the ss. units return a 3.1 p.c.
yield on the new dividend rate, which is
quite satisfactory for those who have
already had some capital benefits, but
may be too low to entice the short-term
investor. -


What’s the Secret of Waltons’ Expansion?
Need to strengthen the company’s securities
By ROGER RANDERSON
YlTaltons’ group of companies is quite
intriguing because, unlike most
others, it seems to have felt no impact
from the recent recession; and, expand-
ing rapidly, has announced regularly
rising profits during and since that diffi-
cult period.
What secret of success has the chair-
man and managing director, Mr John
R. Walton, discovered?
His influence on policy has received
no check since Sears Roebuck of USA
disposed of their 23 p.c. interest in
1959, and since Mr Norman B. Rydge
retired from the board in December,
1960.
If there were policy differences with
Sears Roebuck, they have never been
fully disclosed.
The company’s bankers for many
years were the National Bank of Aus-
tralasia, Bank of New South Wales and
Commonwealth Trading Bank, but last
year the company’s connection with the
“Wales” was severed.
J. B. Were and Son underwrote issues
of registered first mortgage debenture
stock and registered redeemable notes
in 1961, but there was no underwriter
for similar issues in 1963.
Without the publication of figures
showing the value of goods sold, it is
uncertain whether Waltons is pushing
out consumer credit as a means of in-
creasing trade through 65 or more stores
in three of the eastern States, or whether
extension of the chain of stores is an
auxiliary aid to building up its financial
activities.
I do not in any way reflect on the
company’s soundness and capacity to
meet commitments under present con-
ditions. Nevertheless, risks in the future
must be considered; and I believe that
this is an appropriate time for lenders
to Waltons, Waltons Credit Corporation,
Amalgamated Retailers and other sub-
sidiaries to re-assess the real worth of
various kinds of security being offered
to them.
TYifficulties in the way of doing this
are due to a criss-cross of borrow-
ings and guarantees among member-com-
panies of the group, which number 57.
Shareholders to date have had nothing
to complain about, although they should
not overlook the long-run implications
of their small equity. At last balancing
date they owned only 26 p.c. of the
group’s assets.
Protection of company creditors, how-
ever, in times when a banking system is
not allowed to fulfil its intended
functions, has become far more import-
ant than protection of shareholders.
This is the object of the recent Vic-
torian Companies (Public Borrowings)
Act, 1963, which is on the way to be-
coming part of the Commonwealth’s uni-
form law.
And it is the most interesting question
raised by an analysis of Waltons’
accounts.
Assets rose by £15,495,874 (or 56 p.c.)
to £43,409,049 in the three years from
July, 1960, to July, 1963.
Debts of Waltons’ customers (shown
as “Accounts Receivable” less provisions)
represented three-quarters of the addi-
tional assets acquired during the period.
They increased during the three years
by £10,209,426 (or 62 p.c.) to
£26,519,400.
This rapid rate of expansion was
financed by an increase of only
£1,942,140 in shareholders’ funds, which
amounted to £11,387,615 at the balanc-
ing date last July.
YlTaltons, therefore, relied on borrowed
money to finance 87 p.c. of addi-
tions to its assets during the three-year
period.
Naturally, the company’s interest
bill has gone up, and the £1,863,546
of interest payments in 1962-63 is prob-
ably double what it was in 1960-61.
Nevertheless, the company has an-
nounced the following rising scale of
profits:
£
1960 850,895
1961 1,064,609
1962 1,208,659
1963 .... 1,394,458
Half year
1964 805,154
“The greatest single factor in the
continuing success of the Company,”
according to Mr Walton, is the “Profit
Sharing Fund.”
Waltons paid out £IOO,OOO in
1962-63 to supplement employee con-
tributions, for the purpose of increasing
the fund’s purchases of shares and
convertible notes. The fund’s total hold-
ings numbering 2,000,000 (with market
value of more than £1,650,000 last
July) gave employees a 51 p.c. interest
in the company.
Another reason often given for the
rise in earnings is that about 600 repre-
sentatives in a “home service organisa-
tion” maintain contact with more than
300,000 families.
Has this enabled Waltons to avoid the
bad, doubtful and slow debts, which are
still reducing the profitability of other
hire-purchase and similar credit pur-
veyors?
Come beneficial effects from both the
profit sharing fund and the home
service organisation may be conceded,
but there must be a deeper underlying
reason for the results shown.
If Waltons were on the point of con-
solidating its position, one could be im-
pressed by several points in its favor.
Ordinary capital was increased by
£1,299,048 to £6,704,742 on August 1
last year, as the result of the one-for-
six cash issue to share and note holders.
Mr Walton gave the annual meeting
figures suggesting that repayment of cus-
tomers’ accounts is due much earlier than
maturities of funds borrowed to finance
instalment credit sales.
Unearned income provision meets the
current convention at 13 p.c. of “cus-
tomers’ accounts receivable” last July.
Finally, there are £845,401 of con-
vertible notes which will become ordin-
ary capital at the end of July next year,
and a further £1,506,260 at the end
of the following year.
But there are many signs, including
the expansion programme in Victoria,
to indicate that the company may in-
crease its borrowings much further.
Profits of companies like Waltons are
heavily dependent on keeping capital
low relatively to ever-increasing borrow-
ings. But maturities accumulate, and,
when borrowings fall off, difficulties are
experienced because profits rapidly
decline.
The sky may seem to be the limit
with such high gearing, but it never is,
as recent company experience should
have amply warned us. The absence
of signs of consolidation emphasises the
necessity to consider Walton’s borrow-


ing methods and such limits as may
exist.
“Liquid funds,” Mr. Walton informed
his annual meeting, “are currently in
excess of £7 million.”
A glance at the table below shows
that the group held no more than
£1,698,000 in cash and deposits at call
on July 31 of last year wdth applica-
tion money of £1,271,336 in hand the
day before shares in the new issue were
allotted.
Mr. Walton, w'ho claims that he is
adhering to “conservative financial poli-
cies and accounting practices”, is re-
garding £5,302,000 of “unused bank
overdrafts” as part of the group's
“liquid funds”.
What assets w 7 ere mortgaged to the
banks, and when, to secure these over-
draft facilities?
Answers to these questions are neces-
sary to determine whether the security
held out to the public for the listed
issues by the parent Waltons of “regis-
tered first mortgage debenture stock”
and the unlisted issues by the subsidiary,
Waltons Credit Corporation, of both
“registered first mortgage debenture
stock” and “registered redeemable notes”
has been preserved.
Allowance is made in the table below
for Waltons’ debenture redemption sink-
ing fund, but this is not significant if it
only grows at last year's rate of £82,412.
Amalgamated Retailers Ltd (included
in “other subsidiaries” in the table be-
low) guarantees principal and interest of
the parent Waltons’ debenture stock.
However, Amalgamated Retailers is a
company with paid up capital of £1 15s.
and its reserves total only £46,786 2s. 2d.
This subsidiary, w'hich also runs a
finance business, had borrowed
£36,373,544 from related companies
and was owed £30,917,457 by them on
July 31 last—so that its indebtedness to
the rest of the group was £5,456,087.
parent Waltons (not the group)
"‘unconditionally guarantees” about
£l6 million of the Credit Corporation's
liabilities of £18,125,000.
As at July 31 last, without recourse
to the contingent assets (being its rights
of subrogation against the Credit Cor-
poration), the parent, if it had been
called upon to meet such guarantee,
could not have done so and discharged
all its other liabilities from its own
assets-—even if all its shares in the sub-
sidiaries had realised their cost price and
the net balance of about £12,097,000
owed by subsidiaries had been re-
covered.
“Other subsidiaries”, however, with
£6 million of their freeholds at a 1960
valuation, showed a net surplus of tan-
gible assets of only £6,291,000 little
more than half what they owed the
parent company.
The group's stability thus depends
almost entirely on the credit-worthiness
of store customers, who are debtors
either of the Credit Corporation or
other subsidiaries and on each link
of the chain holding firm.
No limit exists to the amount Waltons
Credit Corporation may, borrow by
issuing registered redeemable notes, and
the Stock Exchange does not list them,
although its members arrange sub-
scriptions.
Borrowings by Walton Credit Corpor-
ation by issuing registered first mort-
gage debenture stock, also unlisted, are
limited to six times shareholders’ funds,
or 80 p.c. of so-called “liquid assets”,
whichever is the less.
“Liquid assets”, as defined by the
trust deed, include as the first item
“advances and loans”, and, as the
second item, outstandings on hire-pur-
chase contracts.
What would be thought if licensed
banks called their overdrafts, although
repayable on demand, “liquid” assets?
No more spiralling basis for building
debt on debt could be conceived.
Waltons Credit Corporation had the
power last July to increase its issues of
“registered first mortgage debenture
stock” by £6,826,149 to £19,125,780,
and no doubt its borrowing limit is even
greater now.
Clearly, all units of the group should
clarify the position concerning their
indebtedness and provide greater safe-
guards for their creditors, not excluding
members of the public who leave
money on deposit with them.

Happy Birthday for Coles
Will 50th anniversary be celebrated with an issue?
By “SECURITY”
Tf G. J. Coles & Co. Ltd is going to
mark its 50th anniversary by raising
more equity capital, the drop in the
share prices from 19s. 9d. on March 9
to the current price of 19s. (March
25) must be regarded as rather sur-
prising.
Since the last balance date, £2 mil-
lion has been received from an issue of
unsecured notes maturing in 1978 and
the £2 million of unsecured notes
already on issue have been re-negotiated
to mature in 1980. Even so, it would
seem that unless there have been other
fixed interest raisings since June 29,
1963, the company is still low-geared
as long-term fixed interest capital repre-
sents less than one-third of the equity
capital and only just over 20 p.c. of
equity shareholders’ funds.
It must be assumed that at least part
of the new funds received went in re-
duction of overdraft, for Coles’ year-end
overdraft figure is usually much lower
than the £1,016,903 shown in the June,
1963, consolidated balance sheet. But
even making this assumption, net working
capital i.e., current assets less cur-
rent liabilities would have been nega-
tive.
It must therefore be felt that there
may be some justification for treating the
“short-term loans” as “permanent” fixed
interest capital, although they have only
constituted a major item in the balance
sheet for the last three years.
It is also fairly clear that an opera-
tion such as Coles’, where sales take
place almost entirely on a cash basis and
because of the strong buying position,
credit can be obtained for stock pur-
chases, very little working capital is
needed in the normal sense of the term.
Coles has always given a considerable
amount of information in the annual re-
ports and the analyst can calculate a
number of ratios which are normally not
possible. For example, we can calculate
the following in relation to sales:—
Year to June 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
Sales per— (a)
Employee £ 4190 4360 5260 5240 5230
Store £.OOO 197 206 153 155 155
£1 of total
capital (b) 2.63 2.55 1.49 2.41 2.27
(a) adjusted to a 52-week period.
(b) Total capital means shareholders' funds plus
minority interests and loan capital including
shori-term loan's.
While the declining trend in sales per
store and per £1 of total capital can-
not be ignored, it must be pointed out
that: —
1. Coles has engaged in considerable
expansion during this period, including
the acquisition and digestion of Mat-
thews Thompson.
2. The marked improvement in sales
per employee could only be achieved at
the expense of increasing the capital
investment.
If we compare Coles’ total sales with
the Commonwealth Statistician’s figures
for retail sales, it is necessary to exclude
certain items such as butcher’s meat,
electrical goods, furniture and floor
coverings and chemist’s goods. Coles’
percentage of the total then runs as
follows:
Year 1958/9 1959/60 1960/1 1961/2 1962/3
3.4 3.6 4.7 4.8 4.8
fairly substantial increase in
A 1960-61 probably arises mainly from
the acquisition of Matthews Thompson’s
grocery chains. Since that time, it
would seem that the increase in the
share of the market has been slight.
This could lead one to the conclusion
that it is difficult to increase the size of
the market share in the short run other
than by acquiring another existing chain.
In other words, growth in sales is
likely to run roughly at the same rate as
the growth in total retail sales. In
recent years this rate seems to have been
about 4} to 5 p.c. per annum compound.
Looking at the charts on page 11 of
the last annual report, it would seem
that, on the basis of net profit before
tax, the margin in the variety stores was
about double that of the grocery stores
and the supermarkets. If future develop-
ment is concentrated in the latter area,
then it might well be expected that the
overall margin will tend to decline, al-
though this has certainly not been in
evidence over the last five years as the
percentage of net profit before tax to
sales has risen from 4.8 p.c to 6.1 p.c.
This achievement has no doubt been due
in no small measure to good manage-
ment and organisation.
Regrettably, similar ratios cannot be
calculated for Woolworths, as that com-
pany does not disclose its sales figures.
The only comparisons which can be
made, then, are those relating to per
share earnings and per share dividends.
Taking the last seven years in each
case and making adjustments for the
cash issues made during that period, and,
in the case of Woolworths, treating con<
vertible notes as though they were ordi-
nary shares, we see the following
trends:—■
Dividends per share 1956 = 100
Year (a) Woolworths Coles
1957 107 118
1958 107 123
1959 112 117
1960 118 128
1961 118 138
1962 132 149
1963 132 149
Earnings per share 1956 = 100
Year (a) Woolworths Coles
1957 100 140
1958 87 112
1959 104 100
1960 112 109
1961 98 126
1962 119 140
1963 122 154
(a) in the case of Woolworths, this means the year
before the balance date, i.e. "1957" is the
year ended 31st January, 1958.
From these series we could only come
to the conclusion that per share earnings
do not show any consistent growth but
have tended to fluctuate quite markedly.
If we look at the relationship of net pro-
fit before tax, depreciation and interest
on long-term debt to total capital, the
pattern seems similar: —
Year Woolworths Coles
1957 92 96
1958 77 85
1959 92 68
1960 85 75
1961 72 70
1962 86 83
1963 n/a 84
Generally one could only come to the
conclusion that Coles’ shareholders
have received rather more in the way of
benefits than have Woolworths’ share-
holders over the last seven years. If the
dividend growth of the last ten years
is expected to continue at the same rate
for both companies for the next ten
years, then it would seem that if Wool-
worths’ shares are correctly priced at
18s., Coles should be selling at 20s.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Extravagant Policy Corrected
Motels of Australia prunes its dividend
T>oom rental revenue of Motels of Aus-
tralia Ltd for the first half of 1963-
64 increased by about 13 p.c., and net
profit was higher than in the previous
corresponding period.
Payment of an interim dividend of 3d.
per stock unit confirms the board's de-
cision, intimated by the chairman (Mr
P. O. Ford) at the annual meeting, that
the 12} p.c. dividend would be pruned
to 10 p.c.
In view of the more or less permanent
deficit of working capital at each balance
date in the company’s short history (ex-
cept 1960) and the consequent heavy
reliance on borrowings, the practice of
paying 121 p.c. for three years was
extravagant.
At June 30, 1963, the company had
an overdraft of £603,221, unsecured
loans repayable this year of £532,562,
and term loans of £2,026,773.
The chairman declared in December
that long-term loans had been arranged
with institutions for £2£ million, com-
pared with just under £1 million at
June 30. Funds were used to reduce
short-term borrowings and bank accom-
modation.
Referring to these efforts to obtain
long-term finance, the managing direc-
tor said in his report: ‘"lt is believed
these efforts must be continued with in-
creased vigor to achieve proper appre-
ciation at all levels and thus improve
the lot of the investors in the accom-
modation industry”.
The long-term mortgage loans were
obtained at reduced interest rates for
up to 15 years, thus increasing the
group's financial stability.
The possibility of a share issue w ; as
admitted by directors in their 1963 re-
port, but at the annual meeting the
chairman told shareholders “no new
capital is likely to be required before
the latter part of the financial year”.
The company w'as formed in Novem-
ber, 1959. Today it has 44 Travelodge
and Caravilla motels both terminal
and transit —in all States, but predo-
minantly in NSW.
The chain was enlarged in 1961-62
by the takeover of Carapark Holdings
Ltd for the issue of 5,392,758 ss.
shares. This takeover led to several
different views on the earning rate for
that year.
Earning rate on average capital in
1961-62 was 14.4 p.c. which in retro-
ispect looks a more realistic interpreta-
tion than the company's version of 19.9
p.c. as the relation of parent profit (that
is including Carapark) to average capi-
tal employed, or the 28.4 p.c. obtained
by capitalising the 12} p.c. dividend,
which was not available to Carapark
shareholders.
In 1963-64 profit rose from
£221,012 to £355,952 but earnings
did not keep pace with the increase in
capital to be serviced, and the rate
dropped from 14.4 to 13.1 p.c.
Pre-acquisition losses diminished tax
obligations, and the provision dropped
from £158,041 to £77,758, while the
depreciation provision was increased
from £48,251 to £105,237.
There are still some tax losses to
carry forward into 1963-64.
In the balance sheet a provision for
pre-acquisition losses to arise under a
guarantee given by Carapark in respect
of debtors of a finance company which
had been its subsidiary up to June,
1960, has been increased over the year
from £140,000 to £211,000, a nasty
reminder if one were necessary
of the state of lending in the boom.
Directors attribute the profit increase
to the continued high rate of occupancy
in established motels, and extra earn-
ings generated by new motels at Wool-
lahra, Perth, Ashfield, Ryde, Tamworth
and Hobart, all of which were profitable
by December. A motel was acquired
at Kempsey after June 30, 1963.
Extra suites were added to Canberra
Travelodge by Christmas, and a new
motel at Goulburn should be operating
in April, according to the interim re-
port.
The company has a building subsi-
diary, T. H. O’Connor Pty Ltd, and a
food subsidiary, Chester Ford Pty Ltd,
both of which would contribute to a
uniformly high standard in all mem-
bers of the chain.
A referral system of bookings be-
tween all units of the chain facilitates
business, and the company has invited
motels of suitable standard in areas
which can supplement the Travelodge
and Caravilla chains to become asso-
ciated members with reciprocal booking
service.
Motels of Australia has a 28 p.c.
capital interest in Rushcutter Trave-
lodge, the bowling centre adjacent to
the Rushcutter motel. The ss. shares
are currently priced at about 2s. 3d.
Last year Motels of Australia incur-
red £l.B million capital expenditure,
but it is a relief to shareholders that it
will be on a much more modest scale
this year.
The non-existence in this country of
a depreciation allowance on buildings
owned by the accommodation industry
is a sore point with hoteliers and
moteliers. The company’s managing
director (Mr C. A. Greenway) pointed
out in his last report that in other
countries where tourism is officially
promoted the government makes loans
and guarantees.
Tourism is currently about ninth in
the list of export earnings, being worth
£24m. in 1962-63. Earnings this year
could go up to £32 million.
Motels of Australia has, within a
very short time, established a first-class

accommodation chain, reckoned in
October, 1962, to be the largest indivi-
dually owned motel chain in the world.
Young and confident, it had ideas of
establishing in the UK, perhaps even
Europe. A more sober appraisal of the
financial requirements has apparently
subdued directors who now plan to con-
centrate resources on the home market,
with the exception of NZ where an
associated, but separate, company could
be set up.
The project for a motel in Park and
Castlereagh Streets, Sydney, was aban-
doned in 1962-63 as financially uneco-
nomic under the existent conditions.
Directors maintain that while the
current cost trend prevails, the motels
appreciate above book value. However,
this is not much comfort to sharehold-
ers when they look at the heavy inter-
est burden from the mortgage loans.
The earning rate is quite modest, and
a period of conservation of resources
would be very acceptable to sharehold-
ers. The accommodation industry has
grown very competitive, and extensions
to the chain seem warranted in only
very selective areas. Reduction in the
dividend is a step in the right direction.
A price of 6s. 9d. (yield 7.4 p.c. in
income and 9.7 p.c. on earnings) re-
flects the re-thinking that has been done
on the merits of this stock as an invest-
ment. At this, they could prove in the
long-term a little cheap, but there is
no compelling reason to chase them.

CENTURY STORAGE BATTERY CO. LTD
New Share Issue Due?
The return to prosperity of the motor
industry in the last year to June 30
set the stage for another record year for
Century Storage Battery Co. Ltd.
Although some diversification has
been achieved, Century is primarily a
lead acid battery manufacturer.
Australian production of batteries has
been:
6 volt 12 volt
1960- 604,000 839,000
1961- 555,000 888,000
1962- 592,000 1,100,000
5 months to Nov.,
1963 247,800 491,100
The company’s other interests are in
metal for the printing industry, en-
gravers’ chemicals, zinc sheets for photo
engravers, and zinc strips and sheets,
particularly rainwater goods such as
roofing, guttering and downpiping.
These with other building materials
were in increasing demand in 1962-63.
On the debit side for Century is the
substantial rise in lead and zinc prices
which is claiming the serious attention
of management.
Prices for the two metals have moved
thus:
Lead Zinc
June 30, 1962 £stgs6/3/9 £stq6B/0/0
June 30, 1963 64/6/3 "74/6/3
Jan. 31, 1964 78/18/9 92/7/6
Either selling prices must be raised
or a lower profit margin be accepted by
the company in the current year, if this
spiral continues, one would assume, yet
sales and profits of the group were re-
ported as higher in the six month's to
December 31 last than in the corre-
sponding period of 1962.
Reviewing activities for the year the
chairman pointed out that pre-tax profit
was a record, as was in fact the final
profit at £122.899 after tax (£87.519)
and depreciation and amortisation
(£60,908).
Directors describe the market as
competitive. They said process engravers’
zinc sheets were becoming an in-
creasingly important section of group
activities. On application to the Tariff
Board the duty was increased on these
sheets from 10 p.c. to 15 p.c. ad valorem
British preferential, to enable the com-
pany to compete with imported material.
Century's factory is at Alexandria
(Sydney). New rolling mills were in-
stalled a couple of years ago for the zinc
products. Now Century plans a factory
in West Footscray (Vic.) to handle Vic.
and SA requirements. Land has been
bought and the contract for erection of
the building was to be entered into soon.
In Queensland the company bought
P. H. Phillips Battery Supplies Pty Ltd
for cash. This was Century’s battery
distributor in Brisbane and South
Queensland for the past 25 years. Land
has been purchased in Brisbane for
further development. North Queensland
is catered for by Century Batteries
(North Queensland) Pty Ltd.
In Western Australia land has been
purchased in Perth, and a building will
be put up soon to provide adequate sales
and service depots.
The company has a 55 p.c. interest
(the rest owned by the Malayan public)
in Century Storage Batteries (Malaya)
Ltd. This subsidiary obtained a sole
pioneer certificate for lead acid storage
batteries in 1960, which exempted it
from Malayan income tax for five years.


Century did experience unfair trading
in Malaya from Japan and Germany in
1960-61 as the year’s report mentioned,
but still managed to be profitable. For
the last two years it has paid dividends
to the parent of 22} p.c.
The company has not depended on
bank accommodation for many years,
and has no long-term liabilities. How-
ever, the bank balance of £32,000 or so,
plus retained profits, may not be
sufficient to finance the new Melbourne
building, and it is possible that the com-
pany will make a share issue, as it seems
to favor a high state of liquidity. The
last issue was in September, 1956, a
two-for-seven at par.
The shares, selling around 17s. 6d.
to yield 4.3 p.c., are approaching their
peak figure for the last three years.
The price is not exorbitant at that.

W. THOMAS & CO. (WA) LTD
A Company Investors Have Missed
11/’. Thomas & Co. (wa) Ltd is a small
but highly efficient company. Most
investors have never heard of it. Those
who have know very little about it. As
the company is listed only in Perth,
eastern newspapers have tended to give
its reports a very poor run. In fact, it
usually scores no mention at all in the
daily press.
In the latest year to October 31, earn-
ing rate on ordinary capital was 30 p.c.
This was slightly below the 30.6 of 1962,
but it was made on capital which had
increased from £350,000 to £420,000
through the proceeds of a two-for-five
premium issue. Despite the higher capi-
tal, dividend was raised from 10 to
12| p.c.
Although the new shares collected only
a quarter of this, the higher payout is
still encouraging as it would not have
been decided on unless directors thought
the rate could be fully maintained in the
current year.
The company was originally formed at
Perth in 1927 to carry out flour-milling
operations in WA. Since then, activities
have been extended to the production of
poultry and other stock foods. Other
manufactured items include bags, can-
vas goods, beds and bedding, steel pro-
ducts and furniture.
The most recent diversification was
<n 1958-59 when several metropolitan
bakeries were acquired for development
and as an outlet for the flour. Further
bakeries have since been bought and they
all manufacture “Famlee” loaves this
chain of units is now well established as
WA’s leading bread manufacturer. The
‘Famlee” organisation also has the
licence for the WA production of well-
known "Hovis” bread.
Recent developments include an ex-
perimental poultry farm at Morley Park
where thousands of birds are fed a con-
trolled diet, the idea being to determine
the best and most economical feeding
programme to suit local conditions.
One subsidiary has installed WA’s first
blow moulding machine which will pro-
duce polyethylene bottles a product
that a growing number of manufacturers
are using to market their wares.
It is fairly obvious that the latest
record profit will be topped next year.
On a general basis it should be remem-
bered that WA is a fast growing State and
Thomas’s can’t help but benefit from the
wide range of products it makes.
On a more specific level, it is highly
unlikely that directors would lift the
dividend (which has been held at 10 p.c.
since 1953), especially straight after a
new capital raising, unless they were
expecting further improvements in 1964.
Moreover, the capital raising itself must
herald further expansion and develop-
ment moves, although it is true that the
working capital ratio could do with a
shot in the arm to lift liquidity.
The most conclusive pointer to a rosy
future, however, is the recent purchase
of a controlling interest in the firm by
W. Thomas & Co., an Adelaide flour-
miller. A bid was made last July, but
WA directors rejected it. Determined to
gain control, the Adelaide directors in-
creased the offer in October and the WA
board then accepted.
Payment was 40s. 6d. for each 10s.
ordinary share and 245. for each 20s.
preference unit. All the preference shares
were taken as they were the cheaper of
the two, but only sufficient ordinaries
to gain control were acquired. The re-
maining ordinary shares are still quoted
on the Perth Exchange.
From the present financial standpoint,
it has already been said that working
capital could do with a boost. This is
the only really weak point in the balance
sheet. Fixed assets have shown a steady
climbing trend, and will probably reach
£2m. this year.
Reserves are so far in excess of paid
capital that shareholders must have
watering mouths undoubtedly this is
one of the factors which tempted the
Adelaide company to step in. Earning
rate has been constantly more than satis-
factory and has comfortably covered
dividends.
This brief resume will enlighten some
people to take an interest in such a pros-
perous and promising organisation.

Tanner Resilient
Johnson Leather shares are enjoying
greater market support than for many
a year, and not without foundation.
At 265. 3d. to yield 6.1 p.c. the 20s.
shares are a long way from the pessi-
mistic depths of 1959 when they hit
11s. 3d.
Record profits in the December half-
year was earned without benefit of new
subsidiaries, so the improvement is
genuine.
The 8 p.c. dividend established last
year is continued with an interim pay-
ment of 3 p.c.
For five years to 1960-61, the com-
pany paid only 6 p.c. which made it
hard for the shares to maintain par on
the market.
Besides tanneries, the company runs
a 7000 acre sheep and beef cattle pro-
perty in the south-east of SA.


SPECULATOR'S DIARY
Theorising on Takeover Bids
Male and female in unfamiliar roles
T\ften companies are labelled takeover
propositions and left at that. One
company taking over or merging with
another is fairly commonplace and yet
in recent years there has not been a
great deal of research into this intriguing
subject.
The lecture on takeovers given by Mr
A. D. Barton for the Australian Society
of Accountants in Melbourne last year
is therefore well worth reading. Firstly,
he shows the correlation between the
number of takeovers each year and the
economic tempo. He then talks about
those industries in which companies
have proved most prone to takeover in
the six years to 1962. Retailing heads
the list with 34, followed by general
engineering (29), food processing (23),
building materials (23) and finance
(22).
The latter part of his lecture is an
interesting comparison between the com-
panies making the takeover and the
acquired companies. Perhaps inaptly,
as an extension to Potter’s “The Urge
to Merge”, the former are classified as
male and the latter as female. It was
found that only 30 p.c. of female com-
panies had revalued their assets in the
last six years compared with a figure of
70 p.c. for male companies. The
making of bonus issues following the
revaluation of assets is a natural sequel.
It is therefore logical that 49 p.c. of male
companies did have bonus issues in that
period compared to only 12 p.c. of the
female companies.
A further extension of the difference
between male and female companies is
that 15 p.c. of female companies did not
show tax provision as compared with
only 4 p.c. of the male companies. (The
taxation provision must now be shown
under the new Companies Act).
In much the same way as the female
companies do not show the true valua-
tion of their assets, they attempt not to
disclose the true earnings. Nor do they
usually give informative reports to their
shareholders. As such, these female
companies have avoided their responsi-
bilities.
General Industries would appear to
fit into the female group of companies.
For the first time since 1934, the com-
pany did have a revaluation of fixed
assets in 1961. However, the net surplus
of £644,000 so created was titled “pro-
vision for contingencies” and shown in
the balance sheet as a current liability!
The company’s reporting to shareholders
in recent times has been, to say the least,
confusing.
In the final report for the year ended
February 28, 1963, published in May,
1963, the chairman, Mr J. B. Clarkson,
said that 1962 had been a year of “sub-
stantial recovery”. As for 1963, he said,
“The consolidation of the group’s position
continues and it is considered that the
current year will show a significant im-
provement in the group profit.”
In the interim report not five months
later, it was stated that trading for the
six months ended June 30, 1963, was
most difficult for the home building and
associated industries generally and this
was reflected in the home operations of
the group, which were not profitable.
With trading not profitable then one
can only assume that a loss was incurred
for the first six months.
If this trading reversal caused a shock
amongst investors (as it did, because the
20s. shares fell to Bs.), then an equally
great shock was to come last week. The
company was not only able to announce
a reasonable profit of £170,000 for the
full year but it was also able to pay a
24 p.c. dividend.
In principle, it’s best to stay clear of
a company whose reports are apt to mis-
lead. Yet the appliance industry is obvi-
ously in for a boom, and these shares are
still only about half their par value. So
I just had to lay principle aside and buy
500 at an average price of 10s. 6d. With
Malleys and Kelvinator in the portfolio,
this makes the third appliance stock.
Against the background of increasing
appliance shares is a reduction in tin
stocks. It now appears that the US stock
release plan by the GSA is larger than
anticipated. Hence the weakening in
the world tin price to £stglo6s. Getting
out of Renison at 21s. seemed a very
good price under the circumstances.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400 Renison, 21/- £4ll
BOUGHT
500 General Industries, 10/6 £264
The debit balance in the account has
come down to £ll7.

Shareholders’ Rights
Discussed
NSW branch of the Australian
Shareholders’ Association is taking
positive steps to educate shareholders by
staging a series of four lectures around
the theme: “Your Rights as a Share-
holder”.
The series will be opened by the NSW
Attorney-General, Mr R. R. Downing,
on Wednesday, April 8. Speakers include
Mr L. W. Street, LL.B, QC; Professor
R. J. Chambers, B.Ec, ACIS, Professor
of Accountancy at Sydney University;
and Mr A. A. Forster, FCA, FCIS,
Senior Lecturer in Accountancy, Uni-
versity of NSW.
Subjects to be covered are: “The
Shareholder and the Law”, “The Share-
holder and Company Accounts”, and
“The Shareholder in General Meeting”.
The series will wind up on April 29
with “Any Questions”, in which a panel
representing directors, Press and com-
merce will answer questions provided by
the audience.
Cost of the series is three guineas, sent
to the Treasurer at Box 5210, GPO,
Sydney, which seems a small outlay for
the information supplied. (Further details,
Mr M. A. Dowd, 28 7982.)
Scant Cover for Dividend
TJigh livestock prices, decreasing mar-
iJL gins and changing patterns of trade
at home and abroad limited profitability
of F. J. Walker Ltd, meat and wool pro-
cessor, in November-December and into
the current year.
Turnover and profit were substantially
the same in the December six months of
1963 as in 1962.
Last year's dividend of 13.9 p.c. gave
scant cover for the 12} p.c. dividend, but
directors say they are confident the divi-
dend will be no less this year.
The 10s. shares now sell at 235. Id-
where the yield is 5.4 p.c. The current
trend of business makes them look full)'
priced for the time being.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
“Big Bill” Gunn Again Wins
a Wool Battle
Need for unity between two associations
July 15 will be an important date for
" Australia's woolgrowers and for
most other Australians, too, probably.
That is the date on which the Market-
ing Committee of the Australian Wool
Board will make its long-awaited report
on marketing to the Wool Industry Con-
ference.
Will it recommend changes and, if so,
to what degree?
A lead was provided at the annual
conference of the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association in Melbourne,
a conference remarkable for more reas-
ons than one.
To begin with, it was opened by Sir
William Gunn, chairman of the Aus-
tralian Wool Board and the International
Wool Secretariat, but not a member of
the Marketing Committee.
That Sir William should be present was
a bolt from the blue in itself. It con-
firmed the theory (Bulletin, March 21)
that “Big Bill” is treading a long and de-
vious path which may lead him to
Federal politics.
For years the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers have been Sir William's
most vocal and best organised critics.
Now the breach has been healed . . .
for the time being anyway.
QJiR William's appreciation of the im-
portance of this body may be
gauged by the fact that he got the in-
vitation to open the conference while in
Peking where he was negotiating in-
creased sales and technical assistance
for Red China. He left Darwin at
5 a.m. on the day of the conference
and spoke at 2 p.m. He came, as
usual, with his PR advisers who slipped
Quietly into the crowd to “observe
reactions”.
Their report must have pleased him.
Indeed, he would have been able to ob-
serve the reaction himself quite ade-
quately. With the exception of one or
two diehards who spoke of “soft soap”
and whitewash"’, the conference was
right behind him. He got a resounding
vote of thanks altogether in contrast
to the eggs and flour at last year’s
famous, or infamous, levy meeting at
Hamilton (Vic.) which, it is no longer
any secret, was largely organised by
some members of the same Victorian
Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Association.
He did not say that much really about
the coming marketing report. He simply
said that IF there was to be a change
in marketing it should be put into oper-
ation by July, 1965.
He spoke more on wool promotion
(the increased levy, yet to begin flowing,
had already given confidence to textile
industries throughout the world), meat
exports (the arrangement with the US
was satisfactory, but there may be long-
term difficulties), and costs (producers
must not “steal from each other” by com-
peting for available labor and services).
(The conference was reminded that
Sir William, in addition to his wool back-
ground, is also a member of the Austra-
lian Meat Board and is on the board of
the Reserve Bank.)
To understand the reason, and the
importance, of the enthusiasm for Sir
William it is necessary to know some-
thing of the background of the Victorian
Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Association.
Generally speaking, the woolgrowers
of Australia belong to two camps the
Graziers’ Associations (Federal body:
Australian Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’
Council) and the Wheat and Woolgrow-
ers’ Association which has different
names in other States and which is, on
the Federal level, the Australian Wool
and Meat Producers’ Federation.
If the names are somewhat confusing,
this is minor compared with the diver-
gences extending through the whole of
the producers’ organisations in Australia.
The need for unity stands out like a new
brand on a freshly shorn sheep.
The lack of unity is appreciated when
it is realised that there are some pro-
ducers who belong to both bodies at
the same time and, maybe, two or three
other smaller ones also. (Presumably
they just like going to meetings.)
But some broad generalisations can
be made . e ,
The Wheat and Woolgrowers are
usually mixed farmers and are strongest
in Victoria. They want a reserve price
scheme for the marketing of wool. Some
favor acquisition, some appraisal. At
any rate they want a change.
The Graziers are usually woolgrowers
and beef-raisers and are strongest in
NSW and Queensland. They want re-
tention of the free auction system.
But it is not as simple as that un-
fortunately. "There are some graziers
who are even more active than the
mixed farmers in the moves for a reserve
price scheme. There are some mixed
farmers who are quite happy with the
free auction system.
Each body has real fears about break-
away and splinter groups. But Sir Wil-
liam is astute enough to realise that the
Wheat and Woolgrowers represent the
future pattern of farming in this country.
There are no wide hats and elastic-sided
boots at Wheat and Woolgrowers’ con-
ferences.
to the regional heart of the two
bodies and the difference is even
more dramatic. The Mallee and the Wim-
mera is where the Wheat and Wool-
growers began indeed the organisa-
tion started directly as a result of the
dire problems in these areas in 1928.
Today the influence has spilled out over
a much wider area, just as wheat is to-
day pushing up into the “red country”
where the Merino has long been king.
The farms are not romantically stimu-
lating. They are mechanised farms with
every corner usually utilised for wheat
or sheep.
The sweat of the “cocky” farmers and
the Clydesdale horses made these farms
and both have disappeared. Today these
farms have anything up to £20,000
worth of tractors, harvesters, combines
and scarifiers and the love of the horse
has been transferred to racing trotters.
It is a perhaps not insignificant point
that true racing men (gallopers) are con-
sidered somewhat ratfish types in the
Mallee and Wimmera.
The towns show the most change.
They are active centres, growing in spite
of the lack of constructive State decen-
tralisation plans, with super-markets,
high schools, swimming pools, golf
courses and, lately, water skiing and
flying clubs.
It cannot be stressed too strongly that
it is too easy to apply State borders as
divisions in these matters. There are
towns inside Victoria which are “squat-
ting towns” and likewise there are towns
in NSW and Queensland which have
more in common with the Wimmera
and Mallee towns than their closer
counterparts.
It is the type of country, and the use
made of it. which is the true divis-r and
the only thing that the State boundaries


reflect are the differing State attitudes
(transport in particular) which compli-
cate things no end.
Farmers are not the only Australians
in need of unity.
The Minister for Primary Industry,
Mr C. F. Adermann, also addressed the
conference and it is not the usual run of
things for Federal Ministers to address
the State organisations of producers’
organisations.
Like Sir William Gunn, Mr Adermann
very likely can see the way things are
moving. Producers’ disunity, bad as it
is, is not nearly so bad as it was. There
exists, in theory rather than practice, a
National Farmers’ Union. All the big
organisations, plus the smaller ones in
spheres other than wool and wheat, are
committed to a policy of active unifica-
tion.
When it comes, and it will take some
time yet, the character of an Australian
equivalent to, say, the British National
Farmers’ Union, will be more likely to
reflect the attitudes of the Wool and
Wheatgrowers than the Graziers.
nPHERE are two reasons for this: There
are more of them and they have more
at stake. A good many graziers, riding
high, wide and handsome on the sheep’s
back, simply devote their energies to
running their properties.
In a sense, also, unity is being forced
upon the primary industries whether
they like it or not.
The Wool Industry Conference is
rapidly assuming the position of being
the supreme body of the industry.
The Federal Government, committed
to matching pound-for-pound the wool
promotion levy increase, is involved to
a degree that may foreshadow further
involvement in all rural industries, par-
ticularly if costs continue to soar in pri-
mary industries as a result of an expand-
ing Australian economy.
Those who would advocate a return
to the good old days of free enterprise
must look closely at the degree to which
we are trading with Communist coun-
tries, China and Russia.
Lenin’s remark, “When the capitalist
world begins to seek our trade it will
finance its own destruction’’, is worth
recalling.
Sir William Gunn was referring to the
dangers of this when he told the Wheat
and Woolgrowers’ Conference that
Yugoslavia, for instance, could undercut
our beef exports simply by deciding
that “the currency is more important
than the price”.
But if Sir William Gunn appreciates
the importance of getting people on his
side, this does not explain the enthusiasm
with which the Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Conference greeted him. Obviously there
were moves behind the scenes.
What the conference delegates wanted
to hear about was marketing, and while
they did not get this from Sir William
they did get it from another speaker,
Mr F. R. Howell, the conference’s dele-
gate sitting on both the Australian Wool
Board and the Australian Wool Indus-
try Conference.
The Wool Industry Conference is the
body which will decide after July 15
how the marketing report of the Wool
Board's Marketing Committee will be
implemented.
Under the chairmanship of Sir John
Crawford a Federal Government
appointee it is made up of 25 dele-
gates each from the Australian Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council i.e., the
Graziers’ Associations) and the Austra-
lian Wool and Meat Producers’ Feder-
ation (i.e., the Wool and Wheatgrowers).
Mr Howell said he had “good reason
to believe” that the Marketing Commit-
tee's report would be “your way, gentle-
men”. But that would be “only the
start of it”.
Clearly referring to the Graziers’ half
of the Wool Industry Conference, Mr
Howell said that every member of the
Wool and Wheatgrowers would have to
get out and sell the Marketing Commit-
tee's report to the “industry as a whole”.
A Mr Percy Rizzo (who comes from
Hamilton, incidentally) called the Wool
Industry Conference a “blot on the
democratic Australian way of life”. Its
members, he said, should be elected in
a “free and open manner” on a regional
basis by woolgrowers instead of being
appointed by executive bodies.
The majority in one of the most
complete about-faces the wool game has
ever witnessed demonstrated they
were prepared to put their faith in Sir
William Gunn. . . . For the time being,
that is.
Mr Rizzo and other speakers (one
referred to “the cockies’ eyes being
blown full of chaff”) sponsored a motion
endorsing election of delegates instead
of executive appointment but it was de-
ferred until the annual conference next
year deferred, let it be noted, not
rejected.
Mr A. C. Everett from Warracknabeal
said: “Let’s get the plan first and start
the yabbering afterwards if we have to.”
If the Marketing Committee’s report
is not in favor of a reserve price
scheme, or an appraisal scheme, or an
acquisition scheme, or a combination of
all three, the “yabbering” will be loud
and long.
The Changing Poultry Industry
Trend towards mechanised egg factories
Statistics have a strange way of cloud-
ing an issue.
Take the figures which show that> net
farm income for the current year amounts
to about £667 million, an increase of
£l3l million over the previous year and
the highest since 1950-51.
On the surface things seem very bright
for primary producers. Why, then, all the
complaints about troubles in almost
every rural industry?
Are farmers never happy unless the sun
is shining and the rain falling at the same
time?
Costs, increasing as the Australian
economy expands, provide part of the
answer. Even though there is more
stability just at present than a few years
ago, the fact remains that costs are an
enormous problem.
So also are the terms governing over-
seas trade, the source of the greater part
of the farm income. We now need one-
third more exports to pay for the same
quantity of imports as in 1950.
But just as important as costs is the
matter of the sharing of the farm income.
It is very difficult to get accurate figures
on this and they are complicated by such
things as farmers owning more than one
property or having interests in enterprises
other than farming. But a fairly dramatic
indication of what is happening is given
by figures which show that the number
of egg producers in the State of Victoria
dropped by 20 per cent last financial year
because of uneconomic prices ... to
them, that is.
The egg business is by no means a firm
guide to other industries. Indeed it is
for a number of reasons probably the
least stable of all. Nevertheless it is signi-
ficant to note that until 1962-63 egg
producers followed the fairly general
farming habit of offsetting lower prices
by increasing production. But a stage is
reached where it is simply impossible for
the individual farmer to increase his pro-
duction enough. What happens, in the
case of egg producers, is that they go to
work for somebody else.
The trend is to vast, mechanised egg •
“factories.” Presumably, if the trend
continues, there will be eventual mergers
of these “factories” and it could get to
the stage of Melbourne or Sydney deriv-
ing all its eggs from one huge complex.
What goes for eggs also goes for broil-
ers and table birds. The figures relating
to Steggles Holdings Ltd (The Bulletin
7/3/64) give an indication of the size of
the successful broiler operations these
days.


Plant is worth £343,000. Profit, over
five years, amounts to £76,000.
This makes the prospect of retiring to
a comfortable little poultry farm look
pretty sick.
It must not be overlooked that poultry
lend themselves to this kind of operation
and, provided enough jobs are found,
there may be no great harm in it.
But it exists, to varying degrees, in
other rural industries and the farmer as
a proprietor, with all that entails (pride,
independence, community service, etc.)
might appear to be disappearing.
Now, in Britain, comes a theory that
there may be a swing back as the city
dweller gets more affluent and begins to
exercise a choice. It has been shown, not
very conclusively, that as families move
up the income scale they tend to switch
from the supermarkets to “prestige”
establishments selling quality foodstuffs
from individual farm sources.
Signs extolling the virtues of so and
so’s “genuine farm range eggs” as against
the eggs from caged birds in the factories
are appearing.
Bacon, ham, mutton, beef and more
exotic fare —pheasant and trout —are
getting similar “personalised” promotion.
Maybe the British affection for snob-
bery in all its various forms makes this
kind of thing possible.
So far it is little more than a theory,
but it is one worth watching. There may
be some hope for the small farmer after
all.
Trigger-happy Louts are
Farm Problem
farmers in proximity to the larger
Australian cities —and some even
in remote areas —have had the experience
of having car-loads of hooligans blazing
away at anything on four legs.
The problem of the unwelcome
shooters has been accentuated by the
fact that as game has become scarcer
rifles have become more powerful.
Where, a few years ago, the .22 was the
usual sporting rifle, nowadays weapons of
calibre and velocity exceeding even the
.303 army rifle are commonplace.
If they are expensive to buy—up to
£2so—hire-purchase takes care of that.
There have been repeated instances of
livestock, tanks, sheds and homesteads
being hit by bullets fired by shooters out
of sight and hearing.
The problem has become so bad in
Victoria, more closely settled than other
States, that the State now makes it an
offence for anyone to shoot on any prop-
erty without the owner's permission.
But making it an offence is one thing.
Catching the offenders is another.
Recently a grazier near Melbourne was
beaten up by a group of shooters he had
attempted to apprehend. Fortunately they
took a wrong turning in their car after
they had left him and police, summoned
nearly an hour after the ugly incident,
were -able to nab them.
In Victoria, as in most other States,
any rifle over .22 calibre must be regis-
tered. But often this is a mere formality.
Once it is registered there is no check on
how it is used.
There is a growing school of thought,
both in Australia and in overseas count-
ries where similar problems arise, that
registering the rifle is shutting the stable
door after the horse has bolted.
It would be much better, and com-
paratively easier as far as paper work is
concerned, to register the shooter.
While this method would not be fool-
proof (a man could still bolt instead of
producing his licence) it would be a much
more effective check on irresponsible
types.
A move in the right direction has come
from the Victorian Field and Game As-
sociation. This body teaches young mem-
bers how to handle guns safely and how
to conduct themselves in the field.
It engages in much fauna preservation
activity— notably the care of the breed-
ing grounds for wild ducks. Indeed, it
is so active in this field that Australian
wildlife, some varieties of which are fast
disappearing, has little to fear from the
intelligent shooter to whom the sport
comes first and the kill second.
The encouragement of this body, and
similar bodies in other States, may in the
long run be the best method of curbing
the trigger-happy louts who must inevit-
ably bring shooting generally into dis-
repute.
Portable X-ray for Vets.
A portable x-ray unit for use by
-*"*■ veterinary surgeons has been pro-
duced by a British firm. Although com-
pact and easy to use, the apparatus is
powerful enough for radiography of the
entire body structure of small animals.
The unit employs a specially designed
x-ray tube with an extremely small effec-
tive focus, permitting short focal film
distances and ensuring a high degree
of radiographic detail with minimal dis-
tortion. It can be operated from any
ordinary lighting supply. Makers are

Grosvenor Place, London.
Warning on Need
for New
"Super” Deposits
A serious position in regard to the
supply and cost of superphosphate
and the lack of effort to find new
deposits were outlined by Professor
C. M. Donald at the annual meeting in
Melbourne at the Australian Institute of
Agricultural Science.
Prof. Donald, who is Professor of
Agriculture at Adelaide University, is
the retiring president of the institute.
In his retiring address he said that unless
deposits of superphosphate could be
found in Australia close to a port or a
railhead, a sharp rise in cost—at least
30 p.c. and probably more —was inevit-
able when existing Pacific island deposits
were exhausted in a few years.
Professor Donald said world use of
superphosphate fertilisers was increasing
at a rate of more than 4 p.c. a year, so
that it would double within the next 17
years, or sooner. Deposits on Nauru,
Ocean and Christmas Islands would be
exhausted in about 25 years, or even
before that.
There were enormous deposits of rock
phosphate in other countries. Those
already surveyed would provide enough
to cover the entire land surface of the
earth with superphosphate at the rate of
two tons to the acre. But a more active
search for deposits in Australia was
needed since these would be the best
solution to our problems of supply. The
present search work was quite inade-
quate for a task of such size and
importance.
Emphasising the importance of super-
phosphate to Australian agriculture, Pro-
fessor Donald said a recent Victorian
survey had disclosed that differences in
wool production per acre in 36 shires,
with annual rainfall varying from 13 to
31 inches, depended more on differences
in the amount of superphosphate used
than on differences in rainfall.
The bounty of <£.3 a ton on super-
phosphate would give greater benefit to
Australian agriculture than any other
form of aid that could be devised.
The immediate plans for the pro-
duction of concentrated phosphate ferti-
lisers (double and triple superphosphate)
in Melbourne, Port Kembla and Bris-
bane were of great importance in re-
ducing heavy transport and distribution
costs. These fertilisers would, however,
contain only phosphorus, while ordinary
superphosphate also contained sulphur,
which was a deficient element in many
soils. Thus there was an urgent need
to define the extent of sulphur deficiency
in areas where double and triple super-
phosphate might be available for use.

Lambing Rate
Reduced
by Red Clover
Tn an experiment at Canberra, ewes that
A were moved to a red clover pasture
during the three weeks before mating pro-
duced 30 per cent fewer lambs than ewes
left on unimproved pasture the whole
time.
This is one of the findings from a ser-
ies of studies being conducted by Dr F.
Morley, of the CSIRO Division of Plant
Industry.
The experiments are by no means
complete but, because of their probable
practical application, Dr Morley draws
attention to the risk which might be run
by mating flocks on clover-dominant
pastures. The extent to which the results
would apply to other pasture regions in
Australia requires some further examina-
tion.
Previous experiments at Canberra had
shown that relatively small doses of syn-
thetic oestrogen, a female sex hormone,
caused temporary infertility in Merinos
when given during a mating period. It
appeared possible that natural oestrogens
consumed in pasture could have the same
effect.
Dr Morley’s team has now shown that
reproductive performance may be greatly
reduced if ewes are mated on pastures in
which red clover is an important com-
ponent. But the ewes will probably not
be harmed if removed from such pastures
for three weeks before and during mat-
ing.

Omega Constellation. Requires no winding. Can be worn while swimming or golfing. The calendar feature is invaluable when dating letters and cheques.

This Omega Constellation is the pride of a people
; :w x\\
car'
Dedicated Swiss craftsmanship has gifted it with accuracy. Loving Swiss care has
endowed it with long life. The Constellation Chronometer is one of the finest watches ever
produced in Switzerland. Read why.
They make it with love. Ask Omega
craftsmen about the Constellation and
they will talk like proud parents. Because
they have an inborn love of fine
craftsmanship.
They gift it with accuracy. Skill and
experience tell them that an error of no
more than one-ninth the diameter of a
hair can seriously affect accuracy and
durability. Therefore they work and
think in thousandths of millimeters.
They endow it with long life. They
know that friction is the deadly enemy
of longevity. That high-speed metal-to-
metal contact can produce wear. That
one tiny particle of dust is dangerous to
a watch mechanism. Therefore they
polish the moving parts until they gleam
like mirrors. Furnish the watch with
jewelled bearings. “Scrub” the com-
ponents ultrasonically and chemically,
1215 times in all. Work in spotless,
hygienic surroundings.
They put it to the test. No Constellation
is ever placed on sale until it has proved
its worthiness. Each Constellation must
prove its accuracy during 360 hours in
a Swiss Institute for Official Chrono-
meter Tests; it must also receive a
certificate endorsed “Especially Good
Results.” This is the highest accuracy
rating the Institute can confer.
They place it in trustworthy hands. You
won’t find an Omega Constellation in
every jeweller’s shop. Its sale has
been entrusted only to jewellers who
thoroughly understand and love watches.
The Omega jeweller is inspired by the
same pride and enthusiasm as the Omega
craftsman. That is why he consistently
recommends and sells the Con-
stellation.
They give it full after-care. There are
fully-equipped Omega Service Centres
in 129 countries. Wherever you go they
are within easy reach. Each Centre is
headed by a technician who is Omega
trained. The Omega one-year Inter-
national Guarantee is honoured every-
where.
And they remember it for ever. The
Omega Constellation has a number en-
graved on its movement. It is the link
between your watch and the Omega
craftsmen. The care that they lavished
on your Constellation from the begin-
ning knows no frontiers. Because of it,
the tiny, accurate heart beats stoutly
and proudly. On and on and on . . .
Some day you, too, will own an Omega.
All Omega Constellations are self-winding and
waterproof. Calendar feature optional.
