BMC MINI TRADITION
All of them do better than 45 m.p.g.;
75 m.p.h. - and seat four big
people comfortably. All of them are
based on the original Mini concept
of east-west mounted engine unit,
front-wheel-drive, independent rub-

OVERSEAS is viiai to Australia
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills does both, and this
Australian-owned company is a large contributor to the economy and
prosperity of Australia.
In 1938, for the first time in the world, printing and writing
papers were produced at Burnie from short-fibred Eucalypt pulp.
Today, more than 3,000 people are producing some
100,000 tons annually to supply most of Australia’s requirements
in fine papers. There are "Burnie” and "Ballarat” papers
for personal stationery, Government usage, school exercise and
text books, printing, publishing and special wrapping.
This local production effects a very substantial saving in imports
and so conserves Australian overseas funds. To further assist
the nation’s trade balance, large tonnages of "Burnie” and
"Ballarat”’ papers are exported to South East Asia and other
foreign markets.
Constant quality control, intensive product research and the skill
of Australian workers ensure that the “Burnie” and "Ballarat” brands
rank as world-quality papers.

National Notebook
Black Week
The first day of October began
pleasantly in the snub building on
Canberra’s National Circuit the red-
and-white flag of Indonesia fluttered
bravely in the sunshine. Before tele-
phones began ringing and the Press
began knocking on the door of the
Chancery the week-end was looming
with visions of golf on the green Can-
berra courses for the athletic ambas-
sador, Major-General Kosasih.
The morning’s diplomatic chore was
an informal visit and a struggle with
the Texan brogue of President Johnson’s
long-time friend Mr Edward Clark
now United States Ambassador in
Australia.
The impact of Black Friday came
after the American presence had
departed and the coffee cups were
’cleared. The daily despatches from
Djakarta did not come. In their place
came the strident ringing of telephone
[bells, endless questions, confusion,
anxiety and high drama.
The General like a true Olympic
Ifencer avoided confrontation with
(the newsmen. He had nothing to say
because he knew nothing, other than
[the fragmentary picture of coup and
icounter-coup told by the radio news
! services.
All of them Ambassador, Chief of
(the Mission, Joko Joewono, the military,
jair and naval attaches and the informa-
tion attache Alexander Marentek
ibegan the first of interminable confer-
ences and assessment meetings that were
I to go on into the small hours.
Communications that were disrupted
| on Friday stayed that way. For all of the
staff the phones kept ringing calls by
'the hundreds from news offices all over
-Australia and from New Zealand.
Over the week-end, the Embassy staff
gathered at night round the short-wave
monitor soaking up the drama beamed
jfrom Djakarta’s all-night radio.
I Colonel Sudiono, military attache and
former commander of Indonesia’s
[Military Police, sat massive and grim,
following step-by-step the coup and
counter-coup and the hunt for Untung’s
men by Suharto’s soldiers.
! By Monday morning with the cloud
vf confusion still thick the athletic
[ambassador slid out of his residence in
Ms long cream Pontiac for Yass where
the green golf course offered relief from
Jhe tension. He didn’t play many holes
'before the Press found where he was.
t He took avoiding action to avert con-
frontation.
[ Marentek without knowing whether
Sukarno was alive or dead, where Aidit,
Subandrio or Nasution were talked
on glibly of the public demonstrations
that had been allowed against the
chronic evils in the Indonesian belly.
That night General Kosasih heard the
emotional voice from Djakarta tell of
the murder and the mutilation and
torture of the Army Commander, Gene-
ral Yani and five others of the elite
generals. Ambassador Kosasih had been
Military Commander in West Java
he had served as deputy to Yani. They
were all his comrades and they had been
slaughtered. His face was taut and wet
with tears and he ordered the staff
into mourning. Next day they all went
to the Canberra Mosque where the
General said his prayer.
The news was still black and the red-
and-white flag hung limp at half-mast,
but round the short-wave set that night
came the first glimmer. Sukarno called
for unity, Sukarno was well and safe
and back they all bounced.
Next day the Ambassador was ready
for his first confrontation and was talk-
ing of Sukarno as the “undisputed leader
and father of the Republic”. The army
was hunting the criminals but only as
an instrument of Government. It did not
seek power, only peace and progress,
he said. And Untung was forgotten.
The following day the breaches were
healed and Marenfek sent out the word
that General Kosasih was ready to face
the newsmen in force.
The Israeli Forester
r T A HE honors are certainly falling thick
and fast on the head of Sir Robert
Menzies. Not only has he come into
possession of the flotsam and jetsam in
the Cinque Ports, but he is getting a
forest in Israel.
And he does not have to wait until
next year, or go overseas to get it. On
October 23, the presentation will be
made at a “gala concert” in Canberra’s
Theatre Centre. Pianist Louis Kentner,
one of the ABC celebrity artists for
next year, is flying out from London
just for the evening. He will give a
recital for about 600 guests, including
"He's warden of five ports Yalumla Galway Pipe, Stonyfell Vintage,
Cockburns, Thomas Hardy's show and Penfold's Royal Reserve."

Cabinet Ministers, service chiefs, and
members of the diplomatic corps.
Special flights will bring guests at
their own expense, from Melbourne and
Sydney to the presentation which marks
the end of the fund-raising for the
Menzies Forest project, begun last year.
A national committee of Jewish and
non-Jewish sponsors and subscribers
ran the campaign which resulted in
150,000 trees being subscribed instead
of the expected 70,000. Only donors
and subscribers will join the VIPs at
the Canberra concert which will end with
an Israeli champagne supper in the
foyer.
With his own forest situated near Bat
Shelomo in the Galilee area stretching
over 150 acres of what is described as
“magnificent mountain country”, Sir
Robert joins names like Roosevelt,
Balfour, Churchill, King Badouin, J. F.
Kennedy, Blarney, Masaryk and Monash
as an Israeli forester.
But for sheer size the Menzies Forest
is unique. No other statesman has had
one quite as big planted in his honor.
Volume Selling
T atest entrant in the highly competi-
tive field of dictionaries and
encyclopaedias is that repository of the
homespun American way of life, the
Reader’s Digest.
Work has just finished on the Digest’s
three-volume encyclopaedic dictionary,
a three-year project. It was printed by
Griffin Press in Adelaide and represents
a £750,000 print order, probably the
largest single such job undertaken by an
Australian printery, excluding, of course,
the phone book. Griffin Press installed
£70,000 worth of new machinery to
do the job and to cut printing time from
three years to six months. The print
figure was 525,000 books or 175,000
sets.
The first two volumes of the dictionary
were compiled by Oxford University
Press. The third, an adaptation of the
British final volume, of the set has been
extensively revised here. It includes
sections on art and architecture;
religions; classical myths; chemistry and
physics; cinema, radio and television;
theatre; food; and Australian slang. Most
slang seems to have been rendered into
accurate, if somewhat stilted, expression.
The dictionary will sell at £6 10s.,
mostly by subscription coupon or by
direct mailing. There will be no tele-
phone or doorknock selling.
It Is Spring . . .
happens when a big charity
drive is over? Operation 2000
began two or three years ago and gained
a tremendous momentum which lasted
after the official end of the campaign.
Operation 2000 was set in motion by
the Royal Blind Society to provide Nuf-
field talking books for the blind.
Talking books had been introduced
in Sydney mainly through Mr Kenneth
Bruce, himself blind, in 1955. He became
the first president of the Blind Book
Auxiliary. Author Frank Clune became
the honorary organiser and fund-raiser,
organising the building of offices and
recording studios near Central Railway
station. Dame Mary Gilmore was
patron. Playback machines were design-
ed and produced and an enthusiastic
band of workers gave much time to
recording books and getting tapes and
machines to the blind.
There was a snag or two. The record-
ings were not perfect and the machines
could not be worked by the blind un-
aided.
The resources of the Nuffield Founda-
tion had been working on talking books
and had produced a foolproof machine.
The then president of the Royal Blind
Society, Mr Justice Maxwell, approach-
ed the Blind Book Auxiliary and suggest-
ed that it come under the society’s wing.
A publicity campaign was launched
with as one of its slogans “It is spring
and I am blind”. The money rolled in.
The drive enabled studios to be built
in Sydney. Melbourne was to build
studios of its own. Recording at first
proved a headache. Enthusiastic ama-
teurs couldn’t cope with the quantity
required. Professional actors were
engaged, and paid at a rate agreed to
by Equity. But practical problems were
solved and it seemed that the trickle of
Nuffield books would grow to a flood.
Then something went wrong. Mel-
bourne withdrew its support. The Royal
Blind Society in Sydney told the Talking
Book Auxiliary that only 12 new titles
a year would be recorded in future. At
present there are more than 700 titles in
the library, and a maximum of 10 copies
of each, although with some books fewer
copies are made. This collection has
been achieved in the past years. The
12 new titles a year, which could provide
a maximum of 120 copies, would be the
extent of new reading provided for the
1600 people who belong to the talking
book library. v
The Talking Book Auxiliary has taken
back from the Royal Blind Society the
responsibility of recording and copying
of talking books. Distribution will still
be through the society, but this is pro-
vided free by the Post Office. The
Auxiliary will record and copy at least
100 titles a year. “We feel this is some-
what inadequate but at least it is better
than 12 books a year,” Mr Bruce said.
The Auxiliary will now be up for a
continuing bill of between £6OOO and
£7OOO a year, although it begins on its
own a bank balance of something like
£9OOO. It proposes to raise this without
the benefit of public relations men or
vast campaigns, relying on its own com-
mittee and helpers.

A TALE OF THE LASH
ffitfeuiletin
80 Years Ago: October 24, 1885
X\fE are prepared to support while we
’ live, through thick and thin, any man,
white, black or yellow, Orange or Green,
Freetrader or Protectionist, Imperialist or
Republican, who will help us in effacing
from this blood-stained land the accursed
system of the lash.
The man who writes this was ten years
ago a newspaper reporter in Melbourne.
One day he went to a suburban police
court and saw a young workman com-
mitted for trial on a charge of indecent
assault. Two women and a child gave
evidence against the prisoner. The re-
porter felt instinctively that they were
liars and told his editor so when he
returned to the office. The editor watched
the case and concluded that the man
was innocent. But the workman was con-
victed and sentenced to seven years' im-
prisonment with three floggings one of
40 and two of 25 lashes.
The editor worked day and night to
prevent the consummation of what he
knew to be a horrible injustice. But the
conventional Press and the conventional
public were against him, and the man
was flogged and taken down from the
triangles fainting. The editor did not
relax his efforts, but the man was flogged
once more. One day, after the miserable
prisoner had been four years in gaol, a
dying woman sent for the clerk of the
court at which the charge had been
originally heard. He went to her, and
she confessed that she had committed
perjury that she had suborned her
daughter and the other woman, and had,
from revenge founded on jealousy,
hounded down the prisoner, who was
presently released. Society compensates
him, now that he is paralysed, by allow-
ing him to beg and sell boot-laces and
not prosecuting him too often for vagrancy.
When last in Melbourne the writer had
the pleasure of helping him across the
street —he is nearly blind and giving
him half-a-crown.

"The situation is stable! Everything has returned to its normal place."


PLAIN ENGLISH
From Djakarta to Tokyo
IThe analysis of the Djakarta upheaval
will continue for some weeks
before it becomes clear precisely
what happened. But already the main
outline of the most probable inter-
pretation is clear enough. With Pre-
sident Sukarno’s support or conni-
vance, a Communist-linked if not
Communist-controlled Army group
staged a coup. The Communists seiz-
ed the initiative, called for support of
the “September 30 movement” and
murdered leading anti-Communists.
But the Army under General Suharto
struck back and the coup failed. At
that point President Sukarno interven-
ed again to protect the Communists
and restrain the Army. The result is
a balance of forces similar to the one
prevailing before September 30 but
with the Army in a stronger position.
One of the mysteries in the whole
affair is the way the Army has been
forced to concede and retreat in this
way. After suppressing Lieut-Colonel
Untung’s coup, it seemed to have the
country in its power. Then President
Sukarno appointed pro-Communist
General Pranoto to share control with
General Suharto; he protected Com-
munist frontman Foreign Minister
Subandrio; he protected the pro-
Communist Air Vice-Marshal Omar
Dhani; he took Communist leaders
Lukman and Djoto into his special
Cabinet meeting; and he called on all
parties to pull together, including the
Communist Party which supported, if
it did not plan, the coup and the
murders. The Army which may have
seemed in a position to prevent all
such concessions was obviously not
able to do so, either because of Pre-
sident Sukarno’s tremendous influence
or because of its own political weak-
ness.
However, the fact remains that the
Army is now at least in a stronger
position and this makes possible the
adoption of the rational economic re-
forms which Indonesia’s military and
ideological adventures have delaved
and which are so desperately needed
if the country is not to follow the pat-
tern of Chiang Kai-chek’s China be-
fore the Communist take-over.
The Communist PKI seems to have
emerged with little more than a loss
in prestige. President Sukarno remains
its patron and its supporters, Dr Sub-
andrio and the Air Vice-Marshal, re-
main in positions of power. It is still
the leader of three million members
and of a variety of powerful Youth,
Farmers’, Trade Union and Women’s
groups. The national economic disin-
tegration and corruption favor its
ambitions. It has every reason to be
optimistic.
Yet it has been alarming to see the
equanimity with which some Aus-
tralian commentators have faced the
prospect of a Communist seizure of
power, of another totalitarian regime
in Indonesia even worse than the Jap-
anese one. Indonesia is the linchpin
of the chain of islands from Thailand
to Australia, one of the great strategic
regions of the world. Communist con-
trol of its seaways, airfields, ports,
roads and railways would present the
Communists with control of vast areas
of Asia and the Pacific. Not only
would Singapore, Malaysia, Indo-
China and the Philippines be endanger-
ed but so would Japan which depends
G n South-East Asian raw materials and
markets. The road to Tokyo, as
Arnold C. Brackman has put it, leads
through Djakarta. It is always pos-
sible, as an act of faith, to hope that
Communist Indonesia would try to be
independent of Peking but it would be
foolish to assume that it would be. It
is also possible that parts of Indonesia
would split from a Communist Java,
but even a Communist Java would be
disastrous. For Australia the issues
are as grave as or even graver than
those of Vietnam.
The Ancient Pons
VTow that the waterfront legislation
has passed both houses of Federal
Parliament, it is important to recog-
nise that its solution of the waterfront
labor problem is only a necessary first
step towards tidying up the whole
waterfront mess. The second half of
the problem concerns the technical de-
ficiencies of the waterfront, and they
were well highlighted by Senator Mul-
vihill, who has studied the Port of
Hamburg, the German port which
holds the European record for the
fastest turn-round of ships. The
Senator found that it had 12,000
cranes; the Port of Sydney has six.
Senator D. McClelland has told the
story of these six cranes. One was
erected in 1952, two in 1945 and three
between 15 and 20 years ago. Senator
Cotton added another detail: there is
a very good reason why cranes have
not been put on Sydney wharves; the
wharves could not carry them; they
would fall into the water.
The mess, of course, is far more than
a matter of cranes. Last August in the
NSW Upper House, Mr F. M. Hewitt
claimed there are now 20 fewer berths
available on the Sydney waterfront
than there were in 1939. At Woolloo-
mooloo there are seven freight wharves
with 50-year-old sheds of a capacity
of 1500 tons which have to handle
modern freighters with a cargo capacity
of up to 4000 tons. At Walsh Bay,
Mr Hewitt claimed, the type of sheds
makes five of the 11 wharves virtually
useless and a forest of posts within the
80-year-old wooden sheds makes the
use of mechanical equipment almost
impossible. Other wharves are so
derelict that if mechanical equipment
were put on them it would fall into
the water. At some wharves the rails
are in the wrong place,
All this ine fficiency is not unique to
Sydney and characterises many of the
ports of the country . Senat ' r Ken _
nelly, for example, said that in Vic-
toria three berths have been out of
commission for months and Senator
Keeffe reported that in Brisbane he had

on pa g es 15 anc j 15 G f this issue

ed is far more than a number of separ-
ate p j ans f or eac h port. As Sir Alan
Westerman recently suggested, the
waterfront as a whole needs a national
co-ordinating plan. When the Chifley
Labor Government broke the Commu-
nist control of the Coalminers’ Fede-
ration in 1949, the coal industry was
modernised and stabilised by the Joint
Coal Board, and a comparable pro-
gramme is needed on the waterfront,
There is this difference, however, that
the waterfront involves all States and
the Commonwealth. At the moment
the Commonwealth makes conditional
grants to the State authorities, but this
may merely prolong the lack of general
co-ordination and encourage Sta-te
rivalry.

KECLAMATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF No. 9 BERTH, DARLING HARBOR, SYDNEY.
Back from antiquity
There are no more ominous warnings of the desperate inadequacies of Australian
port facilities than the multiplicity of plans and projects currently scheduled by the
State authorities. The projects range from the northern port of Cairns to Dampier, not
yet even marked on a map of the western coastline, but which planners boldly estimate
will be shifting a bigger tonnage than the premier port of Sydney by 1970.
The burden that these projects are
placing on the resources of the various
State authorities some 30 of them
and how much they leave to be done
can be easily seen from the budget of
the New South Wales Maritime Services
Board, the State’s major port authority.
In the coming year the Maritime Services
Board will have almost £7,250,000 to
spend on its works programme. But 80
per cent of this will go to the Port of
Newcastle, leaving Sydney with less
than 20 per cent of the funds for its
struggle back from the antiquity of its
port facilities.
As one expert put it last week, New-
castle was “a clapped out port” when
the Maritime Services Board assumed
responsibility for it a few years ago. Apart
from the back-lag (current attempts at
catching up include a £2,100,000
harbor dredging project on which
the contractor is already reported to have
lost about £1,500,000), the Board has
been confronted with the urgent need to
provide contemporary coal-loading facil-
ities which were made absolutely neces-
sary if Australia was to make its gains
from the increased overseas market for
coal. The Commonwealth Government
has been of some assistance. It under-
took to provide on a £l-for-£l basis half
of the £3 million needed for a coal loader
(unfortunately it is now expected to cost
nearer £5 million by the time it is com-
pleted).
In Sydney the Maritime Services
Board has spent about £1,300,000 on two
berths at Darling Harbor and has under
way another two berths there. There has
been some rebuilding at Woolloomooloo
costing between £400,000 to £500,000;
the building o' four berths at Snails Bay
for the timber trade at the cost of
£300,000; a beginning will be made this
year on the provision of 1700 feet
of berthage at an estimated cost of
£1,200,000; and “preliminary work” has
begun on the Board's pet project of
berths and facilities “equal to anywhere”
on the Balmain foreshore, estimated to
cost £5 million.
Although the Maritime Services Board
should not be doing any less, it is hard
to see how it could be doing any more
without massive Commonwealth assist-
ance. The Premier, Mr R. W. Askin,
said euphemistically in his Budget speech
that “although an increasing volume of
trade is passing through the State’s main
ports, the condition of many of the
wharves and other installations, particu-
larly at Sydney and Newcastle, falls far
short of modern requirements”.
VICTORIA: Last year the Melbourne
Harbor Trust constructed a master plan
to provide for Port of Melbourne devel-
opment for the next 10 years, where the
volume of cargo is increasing at the rate
of about 10 per cent annually. The whole
project is to cost £ll million.
The plan proposes to establish a new
passenger terminal in the Appleton Dock
area of the Yarra which will replace the
30-year-old Station Pier on the bay at
Port Melbourne. The new site is prefer-
able in terms of the overall economic
planning of the port because its waters
are more sheltered (every other year a
ship is blown ashore after snapping its
moorings at Station Pier) and because
it is closer to the city.
The major problem facing the re-
location of the passenger terminal in the
Lower Yarra is the cost of widening and
deepening the river to allow the easy
passage of large liners. The river has
been widened as far as possible but the)
deepening will not begin until the Mel-t
bourne and Metropolitan Board of
Works lowers its main sewerage tunnel,
which runs under the Yarra at Newport.!
In the meantime the Trust is spending'
£360,000 improving the passenger ter-!
minal at Station Pier.
Cargo wharves are being extensively,
remodelled both on the bay and in the'
river. The installation of roll-on, roll-;
off berths is proceeding.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA: The great-
est optimism is in Western Australia'
where iron and steel are transforming thei
ports. Until January, Dampier was anj
outpost on the archipelago tipped byj
the remote Monte Bello Islands ana
was strictly for the stingrays, sharks and|
game fish that abound in the area,,
Today the Kammersley iron group isj
working round the clock to complete by
September of next year an outlet fori
Mount Tom Price ore which will be!
shipped to Japan in 65,000-ton freighters
initially, building up to 100,000-ton ore
carriers.
Up the coast 120 miles the bottom of


Port Hedland harbor is being scooped
out by a giant American dredge and
the spoil is being deposited across the
harbor on Funicane Island. This will be
the terminal for Mount Goldsworthy
Mining Associates’ ore from 70 miles
inland; last month the Mount Newman
iron ore group announced negotiations
to share the Port Hedland facilities.
Hedland, like Dampier, will eventually
handle 100,000-ton ore carriers.
Meanwhile, Western Mining Corpora-
tion’s export contract for Koolanooka ore
will entail deepening the harbor at the
crayfishing port of Geraldton to 281 feet.
This is to be undertaken by the State
Government and at one stage atomic
energy was being considered because of
the difficult nature of the harbor floor.
Farthest north of the iron ore
groups and the last ones to move will
be the Cleveland Cliffs and BHP pro-
jects also likely to be the centre of a
plant to upgrade the lower quality ore
into pellets ideal for steel production.
At this stage it seems likely the two
groups will develop a common *port
and discussions are under way as to
whether it should be at Onslow or Cape
Preston.
All this is taking the spotlight off
Perth’s sea outlet where the Fremantle
Port Authority has started a complete
reorganisation of its 180 square miles
of harbor.
The old Port of Fremantle at the
mouth of the Swan River which spills
into Cockburn Sound is getting a real
facelift and prospects for the Cockburn
Sound area are being spoken of in super-
latives. At present the channel to Alcoa
alumina works will accommodate 43,000-
ton freighters and this is being deepened
to allow for 65,000-tonners. Three
tanker berths are being dredged to 44
feet at BP’s refinery.
Survey has just been completed for
work to start on deepening the main
channel over the Success and Parmelia
Banks and tenders are about to be
allocated for this job. “West Australians
can’t quite conceive what all this will
mean,” says Charles Court, Minister for
Industrial Development. “Within a very
few years there will be huge ships com-
ing in and out of Cockburn Sound to
serve the vast industrial complex now
taking shape.”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA: In recent
years the accent has been placed on
better wharves and deeper channels.
Whyalla, a major port and shipbuild-
ing centre, and Port Pirie, an export
centre for lead and concentrates from
ores mined at Broken Hill, are the
largest coastal ports, with main work
recently being confined to wharf recon-
struction. At Port Pirie a £H million
wharf reconstruction programme has
been carried out and bulk grain loading
plant constructed. The latest report of
the South Australian Harbors Board
shows a record amount of cargo handled
in the State in 1963-64. Total imports
and exports increased by 4 million tons
to 16.3 million tons mainly attributed
to oil traffic at Port Stanvac. Gross ton-
nage of ships rose to a record 23.6 mil-
lion tons, while shipping arrivals at all
ports totalled 5755—289 more than pre-
vious years.
Latest development in country ports
has been the State Government’s decision
to establish a committee to enquire into
need for additional bulk grain terminals.
Sufficient money has been allocated
this year for a start on a two-storey,
£500,000 overseas passenger terminal at
the outer harbor of Port Adelaide.
QUEENSLAND: The State Govern-
ment last week received an ambitious
report recommending a major drive to
boost industrial development along the
neglected lower reaches of the Brisbane
River. The report was prepared by the
Port Development Committee of the
influential Brisbane Development Assoc-
iation after almost three years of study-
ing Australian and overseas ports, and
the Government is known to be favorably
inclined toward the general recommenda-
tions.
The report envisages eventual indus-
trial development of 10,000 to 12,000
acres along the north bank of the river
and on unlimited land on the south bank.
Major port development schemes are
now under way all along the Queensland
coast, and the report would bring the
stagnant Brisbane port up to scratch with
smaller northern ports. At present Bris-
bane’s port facilities are governed by
plans which were laid down about 1900.
Queensland’s booming mineral and
primary production resources have so
far enabled northern ports to push ahead
of Brisbane. More than £li million is
now being spent on three northern ports
Weipa, Townsville and Cairns and
more on others. Gladstone, with its coal
exports to Japan and giant Comalco
alumina plant, is among the fastest-grow-
ing ports in Australia. Townsville and
Cairns have rapidly expanding port
facilities, mainly for sugar, and Weipa,
on Cape York peninsula, will soon be
able to handle vessels of up to 60,000
tons.
TASMANIA: Tasmanian port facili-
ties are above Australian average. The
ports lack heavy cranes for general cargo
and equipment can be imported only on
ships with heavy-lift derricks.
However, ports are well equipped with
cranes to handle ore shipments. Electro-
lytic Zinc at Risdon and Comalco and
Temco at Bell Bay have big grab cranes
to unload zinc ore, bauxite and mangan-
ese ore respectively. Temco has a new
crane costing £150,000 with a capacity
of 450 tons an hour. Burnie has an old
travelling crane which was installed to

MT ISA
The Victory
Moral responsibilities
The anxiously awaited decision on the
Mt Isa Mines Ltd reinstatement appeal
was released last week by the President
of the Queensland State Industrial Court
and industry heaved a sigh of relief. Mr
Justice Manger’s decision was also a
signal victory for the Australian Workers’
Union and Mt Isa Mines.
He held that on evidence which has
appeared before him no proper exercise
of the Industrial Commission’s power
could result in an order in favor of the
men.
On August 5. the State Industrial Com-
missioner, Mr A. M. Taylor, ordered the
re-employment of the men, who were
not taken back by the company when the
eight-month strike ended on April 7.
The men’s application for reinstatement
was backed by the Communist-influenced
Queensland Trades and Labor Council.
Last week Mr Justice Manger, in set-
ting aside the Commission's decision,
commented that his decision was not
that the company ought not to re-employ
the 45 miners, but that in the circum-
stances it ought not be ordered to do so.
The situation of the company as an
employer in Mt Isa was unusual and
might carry unusual moral responsibili-
ties, he said. He held that the conclusion
of the Commission that the applicants
were not re-employed, because of instiga-
tion by the AWU, could not be allowed
to stand. The AWU hotly denies collu-
sion with the company in refusing the
miners jobs. Nevertheless the decision is
an important one for the AWU which
has since offered the 45 men their cards
back.


NEW GUINEA
Why They Resigned
A break-through
The morale of public servants in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea has
been greatly boosted by the judgment recently handed down by the Public Service
Arbitrator, Mr L. G. Matthews. The judgment related to the Territory’s six stipendiary
magistrates, but its importance transcends them.
Mr Matthews was satisfied that they
had equal duties and responsibilities to
those held by magistrates employed by
the Commonwealth Government in the
Australian Capital Territory and the
Northern Territory, and his judgment
was that they should be paid the same
basic salary as these other Common-
wealth magistrates. (Prior to his decision
Commonwealth magistrates were re-
ceiving £4lBO and the Territory magi-
strates £3753.)
But the real significance of the case
is that the 21-page judgment must surely
cause many of the Territory’s public
servants who were regretfully contem-
plating resignation from the service and
returning to Australia, to reconsider
their decision.
Between the 30th June, 1963, and the
31st August, 1965, 472 permanent over-
seas officers had left the service. In the
first eight months of this year alone, 202
permanent officers had either resigned or
retired from the service.
There are many reasons behind these
decisions. These include a feeling of
insecurity for the future and a belief
that, unless they start again in Australia
whilst they are young enough, many of
them may, with the imminence of In-
dependence, find their positions in the
Territory redundant, and their age a
bar to re-employment in Australia in a
position of comparable standard.
Territory public servants of long
standing also see the various fringe
benefits and attractions which they used
to receive being whittled away. In fact,
when each item is considered, the relative
financial position of the Territory
public servant in 1965 is far less advan-
tageous than it was, for example, in
1948.
Another problem is that of educating
children of high-school age. Public
servants are paid a subsidy of £145 per
year, plus one first-class return air fare
to Australia per child. This has been the
subsidy payable for many years, and no
regard has been had to the fact that the
cost of education in Australia has in-
creased enormously over this period.
Territory parents rarely have friends
with whom their children can stay in
Australia, which means that the children
must almost invariably go to boarding
school. Many such schools are now
charging over £5OO per year per child.
The Administration contends that the
major Territory schools are prepared to
teach the children of public servants to
a standard equal to that which they
would receive in Australia, but in fact
the Territory’s Education Department
has very limited resources and parents
lack confidence in the ability of this
expanding department to meet the added
burden of educating children to the Aus-
tralian matriculation level.
One of the major factors of discontent
is the attitude of the persons responsible
for fixing wage structures in the Terri-
tory. And it is in this regard that the
Arbitrator’s judgment is'so very import-
ant. It represents a major break-through.
The logical consequence of this
decision should be that a complete review
of all positions within the public service
should be taken. The manner of the re-
appraisal should be that all positions fa
the Territory public service should be
compared with positions in Australia
and where there exists in both countries
a parity of function and responsibility,
then there should also exist parity of
salary. Other Territory positions which
do not have counterparts in Australia, so
far as function and responsibility are
concerned, should then have their work
value assessed by reference to the
positions which have parity. If the
Administration sincerely reviews the
matter in this way the repercussions flow-
ing from this decision will be widespread
indeed, and an element of certainty in
relation to wage fixation will be intro-
duced for the first time.
Only then will the Commonwealth
Government have any chance of fulfilling
its stated aim of attracting to the Terri-
tory a further two thousand public ser-
vants from Australia in the next five
years.

“The freight rates ”
While wool shippers laid down like
lambs in face of the North Ameri-
can Conference Lines’ 10 per cent in-
crease in freight rates, effective from the
beginning of next month, the Australian
Meat Board eventually dug its toes in
and succeeded in having negotiations
with the lines reopened.
As the increases are believed to be an
interim measure, to be followed by a
further rise of 17 per cent next April, it
was time for a showdown with the ship-
owners. The moves to reopen the nego-
tiations followed new balance of pay-
ments figures showing Australia’s over-
seas freight bill rose from £175 to £2OO

of the overseas trade gap in September
when imports reached a new record of
£139.7 million. Any new increases in
freight rates would be a bitter pill to
swallow with this new upsurge in the
volume of imports, and would speed the
erosion of overseas reserves, which drop-
ped £6O million in the first quarter of the
financial year to a level worth less than
five months’ imports at the September
rate.
The move to get negotiations reopen-
ed owed something to talks between
Department of Trace officials and the
Conference Lines, but probably more to
an offer of the necessary refrigerated
space to cope with the present level of
meat exports to the States from non-
conference sources. It is also believed
that Government pressure on the Meat
Board helped to galvanise the latter’s
resistance, although the Meat Board
maintained it had been adamant against
accepting the Conference Lines’ new
demand all along.
The outcome was to call the ship-
owners’ bluff and get them to reveal, in
greater detail, the evidence of increased
costs which they claim have obliged them
to increase their rates. There were sug-
gestions from the shipowners that they
were not prepared to be blackmailed.
Obviously such an allegation could not
be read into requests, both from the Gov-
ernment and the Meat Board, that they
put their cost cards on the table.
Independent shippers took the view it
was a pity the Conference Lines had de-
cided to come back to the party as “with
the guaranteed alternative shipping space,
this was the time for a clean-out of the
conference”.
J. C. HORSFALL
CENSORSHIP
Thrills in the
Dark
The Butterfly collector
New Zealand’s system of film censor-
ship, once a model of liberality, has
taken a giant step back into some remote
Victorian recess.
William Wyler’s “The Collector”,
highly praised winner of two prizes at
the last Cannes Festival, has been banned
in a combination of circumstances with-
out precedent. It was actually passed
by the Government Censor, Mr D. C.
Mclntosh, with a few minor deletions
(one of which involved the final punch-
line of the film and John Fowles’ novel
on which it was based). The distributing
company, Columbia, objected to the last
cut and took the case to the Censorship
Board of Appeal, on which three elderly
citizens of Wellington preside.
To the shock of the company and most


film-lovers, the Board banned the film
entirely. “The theme of the whole film
is such that its exhibition is undesirable
in the public interest,” said its decision.
In this country the censorship position
is now such that “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover” and “Fanny Hill” are available
(in paperback) in milk-bars and book-
shops, while a film with the international
standing of “The Collector” which
has apparently struck little censorship
trouble elsewhere is not available at
all. The odd thing is that, according to
reports, there is little overtly sexual in
Wyler’s dark thriller at all; it is the story
of a psychopathic butterfly collector-bank
clerk who imprisons a girl in a remote
house he has bought after a win on the
football pools, and to whom sexual acts
of any kind are abhorrent,
Says a prominent Auckland critic,
Wynne Colgan: “It certainly seems we
now have double and madly contrasting
standards for literature and cinema . . .
the machinery exists already for mature
adults to judge for themselves what is or
what is not desirable for them to see.
‘The Collector’ ought surely to be cleared
for audiences above a certain age level.”
MAURICE SHADBOLT
HOSPITALS
Reform - Not Revolution
The Starr Chamber
Judging from the editorial jubilation which greeted the tabling of the Starr
Committee’s Report in the House of Representatives last week, all the Government
had to do was to accept the report’s proposals the fruit of nearly two years’ work
by a 13-member committee of doctors, academics and hospital administrators.
There were, however, some nagging
questions. Why, for instance, did one
official of the Australian Medical As-
sociation criticise aspects of a report
which another AMA official had signed?
Why did two of the committee refuse to
sign the report? What were the chances
of the NSW Government accepting and
acting on the committee’s recommenda-
tions? And even if the Government
acted on all of them, would that go very
far towards solving the problems of
wastage, inefficiency, and bad hospital
services?
A final answer on some of these ques-
tions will not be possible until the report
is more widely circulated. Just now it is
under study by a Government sub-com-
mittee and has only been seen by a hand-
ful of journalists and a few politicians.
A fuller public discussion will probably
follow when members of the medical
profession, especially some of the
academic members, have studied it.
In the meantime public discussion is
limited and dependent on Press reports.
Enter the AMA. The secretary of the
association’s NSW branch, Dr Larkins,
criticised reported “suggestions” by the
Starr Committee on two hoary, but
nevertheless basic, arguments the role
of GPs in hospitals and the future of
honorary medical staff. Dr Larkins
seemed unconcerned that another AMA
official, Dr Nelson, had signed the report
in his capacity as AMA representative
on the committee. Nor did he seem to
mind commenting on the report without
having seen a copy of it. The AMA, he
pointed out, was opposed to the idea of
dropping honorary staff from hospitals
and replacing them by paid, full-time
specialists just as it was opposed to ex-
cluding GPs from attending patients in
hospitals.
Both matters are, of course, serious
ones. But the 60-page Starr Report dis-
poses of them in four paragraphs. Some-
how some daily newspapers interpreted
these paragraphs as “proposals” or
“suggestions”. They were neither; and
Dr Larkins’ defence of the GP and
honorary was therefore a case of mis-
placed zeal. What the report does is
merely to note in a very limited way
and without naming the dissenting mem-
bers what in one case “some” members
felt and in the other what “many” mem-
bers felt.
As the report states: “Some members
of the committee held the view that in
many instances higher standards of
medical care were achieved in those
sections of the hospital where access
was limited to a classified staff with
special training than in those sections
where access was allowed to all registered
medical practitioners . . .
“It was also recorded that the honorary
visiting system was, in the opinion of
many members of the committee, to
some degree outmoded, and for that
optimum patient care the introduction
of service on a sessional basis or by full-
time staff specialists might become
increasingly necessary. However, the
deliberations of the committee were not
extensive enough to permit the committee
to reach a firm recommendation . .
Unfortunately this artificial creation
of differences between the AMA and
the Starr Committee may only buttress
the view already being presented by
some newspapers of the “revolutionary”
and “far-reaching” changes recommended
in the report. Only by stretching the
meaning of those words very far could
that be a valid judgment of the Starr
Committee’s work. On many basic
questions, like nursing, training of
doctors and specialisation, it is well-
meaning but not very specific or con-
structive.
What it has done is to make some
seemingly reasonable recommendations
about one aspect of hospital reform
the administrative aspect. The recom-
mendations are of the irresistible kind
which any committee confronted with
the amorphous and inefficient spread of
hospital services that has occurred in
NSW over the past few decades would
have been compelled to make. (It could
not have failed, for instance, to recom-
mend the need for an efficient mainten-
ance of hospital records the absence
of which has been a known scandal in
almost every NSW hospital for years.)
Broadly it has recommended the
rationalisation of hospital services by
sub-dividing the State into regions—five
in the country, three in the city. The
aim is to cut down on the duplication
of medical services and to eliminate the
wastage of costly and under-used special
units and facilities. This could mean
that some hospitals would be closed
down, or restricted in the range of ser-
vices they provided. While these seem
reasonable proposals, in general they may
not be the best in detail.
One of the committee members who
did not sign the report, Professor J.
Griffith, Professor of Hospital Admini-
stration at the University of NSW,
accepted the committee’s objectives. But
he submitted a minority report in which
he advocated only three regions for the
whole of the State, each of about
1,500,000 people, each region with its
teaching hospitals and a full range of
specialist services. Professor Griffith, an
Englishman who has been here for three
years, maintains that the committee has
ignored established principles of hospital
regionalisation tested overseas.

"A gust of ridicule ”
The Victorian Education Department,

secondary school students, although it is
unlikely to bring their masters and

A cautionary letter sent out to the

between some teachers and the central
administration”.
Last Friday’s stop-work meeting held
by the secondary teachers in the Myer
Music Bowl challenged the Education
Department to do its worst and over-
whelmingly passed a motion declaring
that, if any teacher were disciplined by
any means other than loss of pay for
attending the meeting, another stop-work
meeting would be called immediately.
The Departmental letter was mercilessly
scorned by the president of the Victorian
Secondary Teachers’ Association, Mr
R. O. Desailly. A gust of ridicule was
evoked by the Department’s homely
advice that their actions “will place
teachers who participate in the position
of a father who, after an unsatisfactory
argument with neighbors, takes out his
annoyance on his own or on his neigh-
bors’ children”. Mr Bolte reinforced the
message of this winsome epistle in his
own inimitably blunt way: “The
teachers,” he said, “were blatantly at-
tempting to sabotage the education
system.”
The teachers would not be cautioned
and called for the resignation of the
Minister for Education, Mr Bloomfield,
as well as recommending that the VSTA
call a strike if their demands for reform
of the Teachers’ Tribunal are not met.
The VSTA's major immediate objec-
tive is to have a representative of the
secondary teachers appointed to the
Teachers’ Tribunal when the Tribunal
is determining salaries and conditions for
secondary teachers. At present a primary
teacher sits on the Tribunal, representing
all divisions of the State teaching service.
Mr Bloomfield has claimed that the
granting of this right to the secondary
service would make the Tribunal un-
workable, but, as the secretary of the
VSTA, Mr Brian Conway, revealed at
the stop-work meeting, it already works
with the Public Service Board where a
member elected by employees of the
Mental Hygiene Authority sits as a mem-
ber of the Board when mental hygiene
officers’ conditions are reviewed.
On the face of it the obstinacy of
the Government on the issue of Tribunal
reform looks ungenerous, to say the
least, but there are some solid financial
reasons which could explain it. Whilst
the present Tribunal does to some extent
recognise the extra qualifications of
properly qualified secondary teachers, it
bases its awards on the needs and
demands of the less qualified primary
teachers.
The State Government realises that to
give the secondary service representation
on the Tribunal would lead to an im-
mediate and heavy drain on already
strained Treasury resources. A rise of
only £2OO p.a. per secondary teacher
would cost the State over £li million
pounds.

The Cassius Clay
of South-East Asia
Nearing the end of an epoch
From GAVIN YOUNG in Singapore
After five days of treason, murder and rebellion, President Sukarno of Indonesia
finally emerged to condemn leaders of the revolt who killed his top generals. He
called for national unity and an end to thoughts of revenge on the part of his
remaining Army chiefs. He is urging similar restraint on angry non-Communist
organisations which are convinced that Indonesia’s massive Communist Party (the
PKI), backed by Communist China, was behind Colonel Untung’s abortive coup.
But Communist newspapers are now
banned. The Army is fighting Com-
munist-supported rebels in Central Java
where yet another Army commander has
been brutally murdered with his family.
In this bitter atmosphere, even if
Sukarno’s call be heeded, it is doubtful
if he can ever regain his unchallenged,
unchecked position as supreme ruler of
this faction-ridden country.
Before the coup his image was not
that of the respected father figure leading
the Afro-Asian world he, genuinely per-
haps, believed it to be. Many, if not
most Afro-Asians, now regard Sukarno
us a dangerous, arrogant eccentric.
It is 10 years since Sukarno initiated
the historic Bandung conference. He
Played a valuable role then. He can be
credited with being one of the founders
°f an organised Afro-Asian “Third
World” which was one of the turning
points in twentieth-century international
affairs. Since then the Afro-Asian world
and Sukarno have changed, but not
always along similar lines. Afro-Asian
leaders generally, disillusioned with East
and West, and eager for peace in which
to develop, have shunned involvement
with one power bloc or another. They
have adhered, in fact, to the Bandung
principles of non-alignment and settle-
ment of international disputes by peace-
ful means wherever possible. They still
support the United Nations (even if they
feel it due for some amendment).
Sukarno, on the other hand, has
broken with those very principles he
helped formulate. In pursuit of his
dream of re-creating a half-imaginary
Javanese Empire to include Malaysia
and the Philippines, he jettisoned peace-
ful co-existence in confronting Malaysia.
By aligning himself with Peking he
virtually shed non-alignment.
He first flouted the United Nations
by refusing to hold a referendum in West
Irian, having undertaken to hold one.
Then he left the organisation altogether
against Afro-Asian advice, when it
seemed to be an intolerable brake on his
ambitions. His plans to form a new
organisation of “New Emerging Forces”
(led by himself and prominently featur-
ing Red China and her allies, North
Korea and North Vietnam) are insulting
to such proven leaders of Afro-Asia as
Nasser of Egypt, Sekou Toure of Guinea,
Nkrumah of Ghana, to name only a few.
These men, after all, feel themselves
mature veterans in the van of anti-
imperialism and neutralism already.
Nor are they likely to subscribe to
Sukarno’s determination to enter the
nuclear arms field, despite his signature
on the Test Ban Treaty. They could
hardly agree when he said: “The more
countries possessing the bomb the
stronger the guarantee it will not be
used.”
They were not to be bullied by
Sukarno into excluding Malaysia from
their conference against ' their wishes,
although they will do so if they feel
like it. Nor did they relish Sukarno’s
remarks that they were not pressing
sufficiently ahead with “self-reliance”,
which is a Sukarnoism that means telling
the big powers to “go to hell with their
aid” (Sukarno’s words to the Americans)
at a time when they were doing their
best to raise their people’s living stand-
ards and could see the penurious chaos
of Sukarno’s own economic backyard.
Far from being a pace-setter in Afro-
Asia, Sukarno, in fact, has become an
odd man out. Any Afro-Asian leader
regards him —as one Communist leader
of a neutralist bloc told me —as “a
clown”. Sukarno’s ego is comparable
to that of Cassius Clay and his utterances
often have the same inflated ring. “The
only great leaders in the world today
are Mao, Ho Chi-minh and myself,” he
says. “The fate of the world is decided
today in Washington, Moscow, Peking
and Djakarta,” he boasted to his people
recently and he has made it clear at
other times that he does not think much
of Moscow or Washington.
He has described the Indonesian
Revolution as “the most awe-inspiring
revolution in the world”. While he claims
it has not been copied from anybody
else’s revolution, it is a ragbag of a
number of political philosophies.
Sukarno bedecks himself with titles.
He is now “Supreme Fisherman”, “Great
Leader of the Revolution”, “Supreme
Helmsman”. He is certainly —or was
Supreme Ruler. He has surrounded
himself with purely consultative bodies.
He humiliates his House of People’s
Representatives by announcing he is not
responsible to them. Yet he is no
economist and he is an indifferent ad-
ministrator who is bored by detail. To
top his impending nuclear programme,
he has promised the conquest of space.

His officers have been told to induce the
poor fishermen and simple, sarong-clad
kampong dwellers, who form most of
Indonesia’s population, to “love outer
space”.
In a country where prices of essential
foodstuffs like rice have rocketed in the
last few months, leading to angry riots
and grave governmental anxiety, Sukarno
can compose a song for national distribu-
tion called “Let’s Be Happy”, which
contains the line “There’s plenty of food
in Indonesia”.
While his country is deep in debt, he
spends lavishly. “I am a great lover,”
he says. “I love women, and art, but
best of all myself.” He drives in opulent
state through the pot-holed streets in
Djakarta, past side streets piled with
garbage. He accepts a gift of yet an-
other limousine, a £'o,ooo Mercedes,
complete with cocktail bar, and then
tells a rally of children they should not
dream of growing up to own gleaming
cars but only to work.
All this might be excusable if Indo-
nesia were a popular people’s paradise
of social progress. The contrary is the
case. About 75 per cent of the Budget
goes to Armed Forces and “Confronta-
tion” preparations. Of the rest a lot pays
for window - dressing monuments,
modern conference halls to boost
Sukarno’s international image. Fate gave
Sukarno an historic, even an epic, role in
Asia and he plays it in tights.
He has past achievements to his credit.
He has created since 1945 a national
consciousness in this country of 3000
islands straggling like exotic pearls in
a broken necklace between Malaya and!
Australia, and he has forged substantive'
unity among squabbling national factions,!
particularly the Muslims, Communists
and the anti-Communist armed forces,
Although he is certainly not a simple
man of the people, he is a golden-
tongued orator and a man of magnetic
charm. '
He has needed Indonesia’s huge Com-
munist Party, which is the most power-
ful organisation in the country, to extend
his control in the countryside. It has
needed him for protection against the
armed forces and other non-Communist
factions. As the PKI comes under
heavy attack, his quandary must be
acute. The whole basis of Indonesian
unity was soundly shaken last week.
The armed forces are now in control,
They may now take a stronger grip on
government than they were ever per
mitted before. Even if, as Sukarno is'
urging, bygones are theoretically mad<
bygones between the armed forces ant
the PKI, the rapprochement can hardl]
be very stable.
As for Sukarno himself, if the idc
has not yet fallen, the pedestal has beeij
badly cracked, and a flamboyant, trouble 1

Djakarta’s Trial Run
After the frenzied years
By BRUCE GRANT
Author of “ Indonesia”
Amid the bodies and the admini-
strative debris in Djakarta this week
lies also a shattered dream, for it
was President Sukarno’s dream that he
had founded an ideology and a form of
government for Indonesia which would
bring unity and hold it after his death.
While he lives his prestige and his
political skill serve his purpose and they
may bring Indonesia through the present
crisis without civil war. But he is 64 and
—as he has admitted frequently lately—
mortal. This week’s events suggest that
the rivals for succession are no more
reconciled than they were when Sukarno
clasped them to the spangled national
bosom.
For twenty years Sukarno has been
leader and for almost ten years, since
the end of 1956 when constitutional
government gave way to guided demo-
cracy, his fertile mind has created con-
cepts and entertained historic crises with
the objective of national unity. He
has irritated Indonesia’s neighbors and
puzzled the world. But the real test of
his mission has been its effect on hi
own people. Would the ideology of th;
“new emerging forces” destined to coi
test the fate of the world with the “ol
established order” rally the Indonesian
to the cause of history? Woul

SukarnoisnV, it drew support from the
Left-wing Murba Party and from anti-
communists among nationalists, Mos-
lems and Army officers. Its intention
seems to have been to offer an alter-
native to the Communists and the anti-
Communist Army High Command. But
it angered the Communists and Sukarno
banned it.
Like Ozymandias’ trunkless legs of
stone, Sukarno’s work for Indonesia is
going to be difficult to preserve.
Naturally no leader is offering with his
peculiar gifts. The other founding
fathers have been eclipsed. Since
Mohammed Hatta resigned in 1956 there
has been no vice-president. The Premier-
ship has been swallowed by the President
and the huge Cabinet is straddled by
three First Ministers. Without a line of
succession and without a man available
with the necessary personal qualities or
recognised political elan the unique auth-
ority of Sukarno’s presidency cannot be
repeated. So Sukar-
no’s frenzied years
have done little to
prepare the nation
for life without him.
Whatever the fine
details of Colonel
Untung’s coup, now
passed into history,
and his “September
30 affair”, or the
less mysterious re-
sponse of General
Suharto and his anti-
Communist Army
supporters, Djak-
arta’s disturbance this week seems
clearly a trial run of the power contest
in Indonesia’s post-Sukarno era. If so
there may be a ray of hope—hope, that
is, for those who have no wish to see
the future of Indonesia decided by civil
war. The shift of power under Sukarno
appears definite: the Army having gained
and the Communists lost. But with
Sukarno's help and their own astute
leadership the Communists may be able
to prevent a repetition -of the 1948
Madiun revolt when nationalists liquid-
ated almost the entire Communist leader-
ship and killed thousands of rebels.
Today the Communist Party has two
and a half million members and it is
more subtle.
Knowing that without outside help it
could not hope to contest power with
the Army on the plains of Java, its more
realistic tactic is to dissociate itself from
Untung’s coup and rely on the President
to rehabilitate it. This will test the
political skill of the Army leadership,
especially the Defence Minister, General
Nasution. Nasution’s bitterness at the
murder of his colleagues and his daughter
is easy to imagine, but it is difficult to
estimate the effect on his political plans
DR SUBANDRIO
which have always been clouded by his
character. A “strong man” of less virtue
might have seized power in Indonesia
long before. Nasution seemed unable to
resist the pro-Communist drift under
Sukarno, and his prestige slipped while
that of quicker-witted and more amenable
men like Foreign Minister Dr Subandrio
improved.
Nasution will now have to decide not
whether to unseat Sukarno but whether
the Army should have more power in
government and whether “NASAKOM”
should continue. Short of a pitched
battle with the Communists, or banning
the party which might mean the
same thing, a well tried range of anti-
Communist measures is available, such
as banning the Press, restricting party
meetings, excluding the three members
of Cabinet. But even more than these,
which would scarcely satisfy the growing
Muslim outcry against the Communists,
Nasution would have to stand up to
Sukarno. So far he has found such con-
frontation difficult.
The Army has a
blemished record in
civil administration.
It took over the
management of the
Dutch estates and
during th e outer
island rebellions
from 1958 to 1961
it established a
duplicate administra-
tion, using the emer-
gency regulations to
ban strikes, control
political activity and
supervise the economy. Perhaps, in-
evitably, it suffered some corruption.
Since the beginning of Indonesia’s
struggle with the Dutch, the Army has
been involved in politics. But the involve-
ment has been piecemeal, caused more
by suspicion of politicians than by
political ambitions or plans. The leader-
ship has been content to see the Army
as watchdog of the nation’s security
which meant keeping a watchful eye on
the Communists, but has not meant
pressing for an economic and social pro-
gramme. This puts thArmy at a dis-
advantage, for the Communists, while
applauding the President unstintingly,
have unsparingly deplored the social and
economic conditions which the years of
his neglect have brought.
The immediate test of Army leadership
is how to discredit the Communists with-
out crucifying them; how to resist
Sukarno without replacing him. The
Army seems to have been given an un-
expected advantage in preparing for
post-Sukarno politics but it will have to
defend it.


The Mind of Paul Hasluck
“I am not a particularly ambitious man ”
By PETER BOYCE
When Paul Hasluck became Minister for External Affairs eighteen months ago, a section of the
Press supposed that he personified the “hard line” on Indonesia and would probably clamp doton on any
“soft-liners” left in his Department. In fact it wasn’t necessary for the Minister to impose uniformity on
the Department. Confrontation throughout 1964 has done that. But while Hasluck has never waxed
sentimental about Indonesia, he hasn’t spoken more harshly than our specific military commitment to
Malaysia would warrant.
His long, August 18 statement to
Parliament made only brief and mild
reference to Djakarta, and, despite the
headlines it earned both at home and
abroad, the reference to Sukarno in a
recent Adelaide speech was merely
incidental, and quite apt for a quasi-
academic occasion: “It is hard for people
with our own type of historical develop-
ment to see these matters through the
eyes of President Sukarno, for we have
not seen revolution in the way he sees
it, but I do suggest that a revolutionary
leader does find it both easier and per-
haps more congenial to continue in the
revolutionary phase instead of facing the
new and immense difficulties of recon-
struction. He has chosen a lesser role
than the one he might have chosen.”
And during the current Indonesian crisis
he waited as long as necessary before
making a formal statement a caution
characteristic of the man throughout his
career.
His promotion to External Affairs in
April, 1964, after barely four months
in Defence (where he succeeded the late
Athol Townley) was widely applauded.
Even Arthur Calwell referred to him
as “one of the few men in the Govern-
ment with sufficient ability to handle
that vital portfolio”. Several journalists
considered him weak on PR, and one
editorial seemed to attribute Hasluck’s
“mixture of shyness and hauteur” to his
sandgroper affiliations and unfamiliarity
with big city life in the east. But ail
reports were willing to acknowledge
Hasluck’s intellectual gifts, his powers
of application and his uniquely thorough
(if fortuitous) preparation for the job
via the professions of journalism, uni-
versity teaching and career diplomacy,
polished off by a long spell of Ministerial
experience in the tough portfolio of
Territories.
The historian's respect for detail and
accuracy, aided by an embarrassing
familiarity with the ways of journalists,
public servants and academics, and
rounded off by an innate conservatism,
have left Hasluck a misunderstood man
in some Australian quarters, including
some intellectual quarters which ought
to know better. He is not a dynamic
platform orator. He has no heart for
foot-stamping and table-thumping. He
dislikes headline catch-phrases or shock
slants in Press interviews and parlia-
mentary debate. And he won’t butt his
nose into every international dispute that
catches his eye, just for the sake of
proving this country’s independence.
The net effect is that people who rely for
their evaluation of government solely on
the daily Press may be encouraged to
think of the Minister as dreary, un-
enterprising and uncommunicative. A
careful reading of the Minister’s speeches
may not lead all men into agreement
with the Government’s foreign policy,
but at least it might bring them to a
more sophisticated level of discussion.
Unfortunately Hasluck’s public state-
ments were not very numerous through-
out 1964. His first full report to Parlia-
ment was not made until March of this
year!
Now 60 years old, Paul Meernaa
Caedwalla Hasluck is essentially a West
Australian and perhaps even more
essentially a citizen of Perth. He was
born and educated there, served out 18
years there as a journalist and university
lecturer, and returned there for further
research after his six years with External
Affairs. His electorate of Curtin com-
prises a fair slice of Perth’s western
suburbs, within which lies the nation’s
most attractive university campus, a
haunt of the Minister. Raised in a
Salvation Army household, Hasluck won
a scholarship to the Perth Modern
School, then (and until about 1950) an
academically elite State high school. His
secondary schooling took in the latter

TOUCH OF
phase of the First World War and the
early years of Mr Parsons’ famous head-
mastership. Hasluck admits to being
infected by the ideals of public service
and hard work then prevailing at the
school. A year behind him at “Mod”
was his old friend, H. C. (“Nugget”)
Coombs.
He did not show much enthusiasm for
journalism as a career when he worked
as a reporter for the “West Australian”,
but he became an A-grade journalist by
the age of 26. At twenty-three he had
embarked on what was to be a highly
successful course of part-time study at
the University of Western Australia. He
was the first recipient of the Lovekin
prize in journalism and he studied in
History and English, where he was in-
fluenced by E. O. G. Shann, then Aus-
tralia’s foremost economic historian and
by Walter Murdoch, the essayist. He
completed a Master's degree in History,
still as a part-timer, his thesis on
Aborigines being later published by Mel-
bourne University, Press under the title
“Black Australians”. He assisted Associ-
ate-Professor Fred Alexander with His-
tory lectures in 1939, and the following
year was invited to stand-in for Alex-
ander during the latter’s study leave in
America.
The major breakthrough
Tronicali.y, Hasluck’s major break-
through to diplomacy and politics was
never planned by him and owed much
to the initiative of the Labor Prime
Minister, his friend John Curtin. He
described the Department of External
Affairs in 1941 in two papers read to
the Royal Australian Historical Society
in 1954 and 1955. Besides being under-
staffed: “It was also very inexperienced,
and its handful of officers were, to put
it mildly, highly individualistic in the
way they went about their work. Most
of the life of the post-war section (which
Hasluck headed) was very troubled
owing to the extremely odd manner of
working inside the Department of Ex-
ternal Affairs in those days.”
To what or whom can we attribute
the Department’s “odd manner” of
working? Partly to its sudden and
dramatic assumption of international re-
sponsibilities, partly to the influence of
its two senior personalities Dr H. V.
Evatt as Minister (from October, 1941)
and Colonel W. R. Hodgson as Secretary
(from 1935 to 1945). Evatt appears to
have dominated Hodgson mercilessly and
administered his staff with a mixture of
caprice and furious energy.
Hasluck’s conception of his own duties
as Minister may be in part a reaction
against what he saw and frequently dis-
liked in Dr Evatt, especially what he saw
at the United Nations, where Evatt be-

came President of the Assembly and
Hasluck Counsellor-in-Charge of the
Australian mission. Hasluck’s discontent
with the Minister’s policy and methods
of administering them led to his resigna-
tion and return to academic life in 1947.
Perhaps his most classic and familiar
criticism of Evatt’s role is contained in
the final chapter of a book published
shortly after his resignation. In “Work-
shop of Security” Hasluck noted “the
larrikin strain in Australian * foreign
policy a disposition to throw stones
at the street lights just because they are
bright”. Apart from the opinion that
Evatt’s “ambition was clearer than his
policy”, Hasluck attributed some of the
larrikinism in Australian diplomacy to
the Minister’s essentially political per-
sonality. He was too prone to look for
debatable “issues” on which to take sides
rather than an overall problem which
required rational, sober, non-partisan dis-
cussion. He was too prone to rely on
votes and to concentrate his energies on
defeating the other man’s motion.
Throughout 1948-49 Hasluck held a
Research Readership in History at the
Western Australian University, where he
embarked on Volume I of his Civil
History of Australia in the War of 1939-
45. His decision to contest the newly
created seat of Curtin at the 1949
general elections was due in some
measure to his wife, who in turn was
influenced (according to Hasluck) by the
late Adlai Stevenson, a friend and UN
colleague. The choice of party affiliation
was decided partly by his dislike of
socialism and by what he saw as a
creeping authoritarianism in Australian
federal government.
TJasluck was given the Territories port-
folio within 15 months of his election
to Federal Parliament. He was then 46.
Despite his old interest in Aboriginal
welfare, Territories was not the job he
really wanted. But he was the first
Minister ever to take the portfolio very
seriously, and he was kept there for
nearly 13 years. His New Guinea policy
has been branded “paternalist” and he
was also considered too unresponsive to
international political pressures. After
the Foot Mission had submitted its re-
port in 1962, “The Sydney Morning
Herald” yelled editorially: “Hasluck
Must Go!” and others accused him of
regimenting the thought of his depart-
mental advisers.
In January, 1964, Hasluck referred
publicly to his reputation as Territories
Minister: “On the one hand, with some
justice, I have earned a reputation as
an immoderate and unrelenting slave-
driver, always demanding more than can
be given and on the other hand I have
received the blessing of being called
academic, vague and, most damning
word of all, sincere the euphemism
for feeble.”
Hasluck was not unaware of inter-
national pressures; he simply refused to
obey some of them. He insisted that
grass-roots economic and social develop-
ment take priority over the outward
semblance of change (which could have
furnished New Guinea with a parliament
or president overnight). He opposed
target dates for independence, and was
determined that Australia should not be
made to rush out of one door only to be
followed by foreigners rushing in through
the other door. “What would you rather
see cast in a ditch a slogan or a
human being?” he asked of a Melbourne
audience last year. “Yet all over the
world today, in the name of freedom
and liberty, we find slogans being raised
aloft on banners while the discarded
corpses infest the ditch.”
When Hasluck took office in 1951 the
New Guinea administration was a mere
1280 men. He left it with a budget of
£43.86m. — a third raised locally, and
a public service of 6000. There was no
public enthusiasm for New Guinea affairs

in 1951. Given Hasluck’s dislike of
slogans and political salesmanship, he
was not perhaps the ideal person to
quicken Australian public opinion to
its New Guinea responsibilities, though
there were scores of Parliamentary col-
leagues who could have assisted with the
PR hack-work but didn’t.
It is not yet possible to comment
reliably on the extent to which Hasluck
has affected the organisation or efficiency
of the Department of External Affairs.
A few senior officers might have been
deprived of some of the initiative they
enjoyed under Sir Garfield Barwick; a
few, like Sir Arthur Tange, J. K. Walker,
W. D. Forsyth and A. P. Renouf were
close colleagues of the Minister during
the ’forties. Hasluck and his new Sec-
retary, Sir James Plimsoll, are a power-
ful combination whether in terms of
intellect or experience.
Hasluck has the habit of writing his
own speeches, where Barwick, Casey and
Evatt usually waited for drafts from the
department. The inconsistencies of
emphasis which Hasluck used to find
in Evatt's speeches were due in large
measure to their multiple authorship.
Evatt’s method encouraged officers to
press their individual pet theories before
the Minister’s notice, several of which
might be embodied in the one speech.
As Minister for External Affairs, Has-
luck attaches less importance to per-
sonal goodwill missions abroad than
Casey or Barwick would have done; cer-
tainly far less importance than many
American politicians would. “I think that
personal diplomacy has caused a lot of
mischief and harm and has impeded the
progress of peace in the world,” he told
John Bennetts of the “Age” shortly after
taking up office. It “leads” to the very
great fallacy—the almost pathetic belief
—of some Foreign Ministers that if they
have had lunch with someone and called
him by his Christian name they have
changed the fundamental facts of rcla-
tionshins between nations”.
As befits a keen historian, he rightly
insists on evaluating our Vietnam or
Malaysian policies in a global context,
with special regard to the overall objec-
tives of Australian foreign policy. “At
fairly long range we believe that the
maintenance of peace depends on the
maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.
This depends on the cohesion of the
Western alliance.”
In the past few months he has deliver-
ed three speeches on Australia’s Vietnam
policy outside Parliament, the occasion
most fully reported being the Monash
University Teach-In on July 30. This was
not the stirring oratory of protest, but
the analysis was clear and reasonable.
Addresses on the same theme to the
Tasmanian Liberal Party at Devonport
one week earlier and an evening lecture
to Adelaide University a week later
were probably effective.
Like Sir Garfield Barwick before him,
Hasluck does not neglect his homework.
Nor does he allow his long hours of
office duty to keep him in Canberra
if a job can be directed just as effectively
from his rooms in Perth. Apart from
reading (Shakespeare for example, or
the plays of Racine) and composing
verse, the Minister’s chief reaction in
Canberra is horse-riding in the open
country behind Yarralumla. His wife,
Alexandra, shares his interest in Aus-
tralian history, having published four
books in this field, including a recent
biography of the hapless Thomas Peel.
Many Australian scholars would wel-
come a moratorium on international
politics to allow Mr Hasluck sufficient
time to complete Volume II of his
“Government and the People” in the
official war histories (if this is in fact
the cause of delay).
Hasluck appears to enjoy the Prime
Minister’s confidence, and their “world

views” coincide most of the time. But
Sir Robert has such settled opinions
on so many questions and such vigorous
authority in proclaiming them that we
cannot be sure how many decisions are
the Prime Minister’s and how many are
Hasluck’s. If Harold Holt moved into
the Prime Minister’s Lodge, Hasluck
might be afforded more scope for
Ministerial action, but the range of his
influence on Cabinet might then depend
on. the Liberal Party’s choice of a new
Efeputy-Leader. Hasluck is currently
No. 3 in the Cabinet hierarchy of Liber-
als, but Labor Minister McMahon, the
No. 4, is a keen competitor for the job.
Hasluck once told an interviewer that
he was “not a particularly ambitious”
man. This brings to mind an enigmatic
remark he made to a Perth audience
seven years ago: “Only a resolute man
and possibly this means as a conse-
quence an unsuccessful man can
resist the pernicious cult of personality”.
The Pope
In New York

From GEORGE McGANN
in New York
1 finally saw the Pope in person,
from a distance of about twenty
feet, as he got out of the bubble-
top Lincoln limousine in front of the
Vatican pavilion at the World’s Fair
for his last public appearance, on his
way to the airport for the flight back to
Rome. Along with an estimated 100 mil-
lions in the US, Canada and Mexico
(and more millions watching via the
Early Bird relay in Europe) 1 had been
following the Pope's progress on tele-
vision throughout the long day, as he
drove through the streets of New York
acknowledging with raised hands the
cheers and applause, as he knelt in prayer
in St Patrick’s Cathedral (which also rang
with unaccustomed cheers), as he con-
ferred in the Waldorf-Astoria tower with
President Johnson, as he made his his-
toric plea for peace in the UN General
Assembly building, as he graciously spoke
to representatives of 115 nations (Albania
was the only nation to boycott the Pope)
in a reception line in the UN delegates’
lounge, as he met ecumenically with rep-
resentatives of other faiths in a nearby
parish church, and as he celebrated night
Mass before 90,000 souls on the wind-
swept baseball field of Yankee Stadium.
It had been a lengthy, tumultuous and
presumably taxing day for the 68-year-
old Pontiff, whose health has been de-
scribed as somewhat frail. But now, at
10.30 p.m. with the temperature hover-
ing not far above freezing point, as Elis
Holiness stepped nimbly from the black
motor car directly in front of the make-
shift Press section at the Vatican ex-
hibit, smiling and waving at us with
both hands raised, he seemed every bit
as fresh and expectant as he had looked
on TV some twelve-and-one-half hours
earlier, when he debarked from his
Alitalia Boeing at J. F. Kennedy Airport.
We had not been led to expect of Paul
that he would be such an outgoing, en-
gaging and, yes, talkative visitor. Elis
face is lean, even gaunt, and his grey
eyes are deep-sunken. But they are eyes
that can twinkle and his smile is as lively
and omnipresent as his characteristically
raised hands. In his white robe, scarlet
cloak and white satin skull-cap he
never donned his wide-brimmed Papal
hat despite the cold Pope Paul cut a
dramatic figure against the backdrop of
this mundane city. Even in the delegates’
lounge of the UN, which is accustomed
to the bold coloration of the new African

and Asian delegations, the colorfully
garbed Pontiff stood out.
It is difficult to make an impression
on this concrete-canyoned metropolis and
to capture the imagination of its engros-
sed masses But something in the
dramatically brief visit by Pope Paul
penetrated the customary self-absorption
of New Yorkers. At the World’s Fair the
customary rock ’n’ roll din was stilled
an hour before the Pope was due to ar-
rive, and religious themes came over the
loudspeakers dotted throughout the enor-
mous grounds. Throughout the city tele-
vision sets in restaurants, bars and other
public places were turned on from nine
in the morning, when the Pope’s plane
first appeared in the Long Island sky,
until he flew back
across the Atlantic
at 11.30 that night.
Crowds watching
the sets were almost
as large on that
October Monday as
they were for the
baseball World
Series games which
got under way two
days later. The fact
that most New York
newspapers have
been on strike for
more than a fort-
night added interest
to the television cov-
erage, which in any case was magnificent
throughout the day’s events, freed from
the intrusion of commercial advertising
in an all-encompassing demonstration of
imaginative electronic journalism. The
major networks sacrificed more than a
million dollars in advertising revenues by
cancelling their regularly scheduled pro-
grammes. Not since the chilling weekend
of the Kennedy assassination had tele-
vision so distinguished itself in the public
interest.
The impact of the Pope’s first visit was
such as to stir American Catholics from
their customary hushed silence within the
confines of a church. When the Pope
entered St Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth
Avenue he was greeted with thunderous
applause, and even the nuns and clergy-
men among the throngs packed inside the
vaulting structure went so far as to stand
on their pews, cheering the sight of their
spiritual leader. When the Papal limou-
sine entered Yankee Stadium that night
for the historic open-air Mass, His Holi-
ness stood up in the rear of the car as it
circled the playing field and 90,000 faith-
ful cheered the Pope as heartily as if he
had just won the World Series for the
New York Yankees’ baseball team.
An ironic observation about the ful-
some welcome accorded the Pope was
made by one local politician. “If Jack
Kennedy had lived, it would never have
happened,” this individual insisted. “Ken-
nedy was so afraid of being called a
‘Catholic’ President that he would never
have stood for a Pope coming here.”
Actually the Papal visit was technically
not to the United States but to the United
Nations which happens to be situated
(to the distress of many observers, not
necessarily anti-UN types either) on
American soil. Therefore President John-
son was not the Pope’s host, nor was his
assent necessary to the visit. However, it
is undeniable that it was far easier,
politically, for Mr Johnson, a Protestant
to receive the Pope in the suite of the
American Ambassador to the UN in the
Waldorf-Astoria than it would have been
for his Catholic predecessor.
The decision to compress the visit
into 14 hours, seem-
ingly an inhumane
act, arose precisely
from the Vatican’s
desire to emphasise
its UN rather than
US character. That
brief interval was
sufficient just
barely—for a Papal
appearance at the
United Nations. No
one could accuse the
Pope of giving more
time to the Ameri-
can people than to
the international
group gathered on
the banks of the East River. However,
now that precedent has been established
to this extent, the possibility of a later
Papal visit specifically to the United
States is obvious. His Holiness told an
American correspondent travelling with
him in the plane from Rome that he not
only hoped to make a more extensive
trip to the US but that he also would
consider visiting Red China on behalf
of world peace.
One other surprise, and an unhappy
one to many of his listeners, Catholic
as well as non-Catholic, was the Pope’s
expression of unyielding opposition to
birth control. “You must strive to mul-
tiply bread so that it suffices for the
tables of mankind,” Pope Paul said in
the hushed General Assembly hall, “and
not rather favor an artificial control of
birth, which would be irrational, in
order to diminish the number of guests
at the banquet of life.”
With those words the Pope took direct
issue with President Johnson, who had
asked the UN at its 20th anniversary
meeting in San Francisco to “act on the
fact that 5 dollars invested in population
control is worth 100 dollars invested in
economic growth”. The Pope also seemed
to be restricting the area of ecumenical
agreement with Protestant and other
faiths which favor the use of artificial
methods of controlling population
growth.

Folk Anti-Hero
Arthur Rylali , the Deputy
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Victoria’s Deputy Premier, Chief Secretary and Attorney-Genera!, Mr Arthur
Rylah, is not a particularly conservative administrator, and not an illiberal man, but
he is best known outside the Treasury buildings, certainly outside the boundaries of
his own State, as a banner of books, a censor of literature.
Earlier this year he extricated himself
from a tangle of stinging Opposition
interjections by laying on the Ministerial
table a number of magazines and books
designed to appeal to nature-lovers and
others. Amongst them were “Figure”,
“Pleasure”, “Playboy”, and paperbacks
titled “The Naked Lovers”, “The Con-
ference Girl”, and “House of Lust”. In
the words of a morning newspaper, “Mr
Rylah then, amid Government and
Opposition laughter, read sections of sex
scenes from one of the paperbacks. ‘lt
does not leave anything to the imagina-
tion’, he said. ‘ln this type of thing
you get sex ad nauseam from cover to
cover’.”
With such declarations Mr Rylah has
become a kind of national folk-anti-hero,
regular copy for the Mavis Bramston
Show and “Oz”, and the butt of in-
numerable pub jokes. Never mind what
the poets, novelists and pornographers
are up to: “The State Government is
determined to maintain clean and healthy
standards in literature.”
In May Mr Rylah went abroad for a
couple of months. The trip read like a
Cook’s Tour of the world’s dirty book
shops. This is a sample list of the Mel-
bourne headlines: “Appalling Books on
Sale in the US —Mr Rylah”, “Book
Surprise for Mr Rylah”, “What Canada
Can Read Amazes Mr Rylah.”
Interviewed at the airport he said that
pornography was a serious problem in
the UK. “I don’t like to go into a book-
stall to buy a book and be offered a
series of dirty photographs.”
The reaction to his views on porno-
graphy has apparently shaken him not
at all. The secretary of the Freedom to
Read Association, Dr lan Turner, has
abused Mr Rylah for statements “ill-
judged, hysterical and ill-informed”; the
secretary of the Melbourne University
Students’ Representative Council has
berated him as “self-appointed moral
guardian” with whom “Melbourne Uni-
versity students are disgusted”.
But Mr Rylah has managed to pro-
ject himself to the bulk of the community
as the man who is trying to save their
sons and daughters from corruption. He
was roundly ridiculed in sophisticated
circles for asserting that he would not
like his teenage daughter to read “The
Group” (his daughter is actually married
and in her twenties); numerous irate cor-
respondents to the Press declared that
they did not want their reading restricted
by the standards Mr Rylah thought
suitable for his non-existent teenage
daughter.
However, there is little doubt that
weaknesses and anomalies in the Vic-
torian Government’s position has not
caused it any electoral damage. Mr
Rylah claims that of the hundreds of
letters he received during “The Group”
controversy only a few were hostile to
his stand. Mr Rylah’s successful pro-
jection of himself as a defender of the
State’s morals has made the task of the
reformers more difficult than it should
have been.
Instead of the debate centring on the
unsatisfactory way in which censorship
operates in Victoria, under Mr Rylah’s
astute direction, it always takes on the
appearance of a battle between an
Horatio of a Chief Secretary holding the
bridge against an army of invading
pornographers. The academics of the
Freedom to Read Association and their
supporters, although some of them
would like to see an end to all censor-
ship eventually, have not requested any
licence for pornography, and have tried
to advance uniformity, consistency and
liberality in the treatment of serious
literature. The tendency of some of their
opponents to deliberately misunderstand
their case has been a formidable obstacle;
another has been the anti-intellectual,
populist strain in Australian life.
Mr Rylah understands their case well
enough. He realises that they want
censorship by court action, or the threat
of court action, to be replaced by censor-
ship by a literary board. There is no
doubt that this would be much more
satisfactory for police, authors, publishers
and booksellers. There is also no doubt,
as Mr Rylah knows, that this would
allow more books with descriptions of
sexual activity into the country.
Mr Rylah's attitude to the establish-
ment of censorship by a literary board
is, in one way, more logical than the
attitude of some of his opponents. Many
of the latter run a line of argument which
is based on the quite unwarranted
assumption that if a book is written with
serious literary intent it cannot be either
or both sexually exciting and porno-
graphic: a line of argument which leads
to the absurdities of the “Lady Chatter-
ley” trial in England, “A Hymn to Chris-
tian Marriage”, and comparisons (such as
that made by a Californian minister of

religion) between Henry Miller’s “Ex-
ploration oi Hi> Own Soul with ‘Christ's
Withdrawal into the Wilderness”.
Mr Rylah will have none of this non-
sense. His attitude is quite simple. He
does not want to allow books into the
State, whether good literature or bad,
which, as he puts it. “deal with sex in
the raw”. “I think sex in the raw helps
to break down the standards which we
like to see maintained in the community.”
No matter what the intellectuals,
academics and students think, Mr Rylah
believes that he has the support of most
of the community in his stand.
Mr Rylah s theoretical case that “sex
in the raw” breaks down standards and
obscenity is corrupting our youth is not
supported by much evidence. In an
interview iast week I asked him what
evidence he had to offer. Without much
enthusiasm for the question, he replied:
“There have been a number of cases in
this State where. I think, criminals have
been influenced by pornography.” He
also mentioned that psychiatrists and
doctors Afio have appeared before
the Kefauver Commission in 1955
claimed there was a correlation between
pornographic literature and juvenile
crime.
The passion of the book-banner is not
so much to save the innocence of the
young as to prevent the open fouling of
taboos taught powerfully and insistentiy
from early childhood. The book-banners
know very well (much better, apparently,
than some literary critics) what Henry
Miller is up to, and if they can’t stop
him writing they can at least try to stop
him being read.
After talking with Mr Rylah, I
rcrmed the opinion that he was disturbed
not so much by the potential corrupting
powers of dirty books as by the public
presentation of sexual activity; disturbed,
in a sense, not so much by pornography
as by obscenity. It is evident that he
also thinks his attitude is good politics
In many other ways Victoria’s Chief
Secretary is an open-minded and pro-
gressive administrator. Basically no
wowser, he was the first man in the
State Parliament to publicly proclaim
himself in favor of ten o’clock closing.
If and when Victoria ga : ns this conces-
sion, to what he calls “gracious living”,
it will be mostly due to Mr Rylah’s
advocacy.
A man who enjoys a whisky or a
oeer, and a smoke, Mr Rylah regards his
Government’s introduction of restaurant
licences into Victoria in 1960 as one of
his major achievements. He regards the
liquor report of the liberal-minded Mr
Phillips, QC as “a charter for saner
drinking”. In the fields of social wel-
fare, criminal rehabilitation, probation
and parole, and some aspects of penal
reform, Victoria, largely because of Mr
Rylah’s influence in the Liberal-Country
Party Government which came into
office in 1955. has advanced from being
one of the most backward States to the
position of national leader. He feels
that the Government is so far ahead of
public opinion in some of these areas
that it may be difficult for some time to
introduce further reforms.
A former solicitor, and son of" a solici-
tor (the legal firm of Rylah and Rylah is
one of the best known in the State), his
practical experience of the anomalies of
Victoria’s company law led him to initiate
sweeping reforms and statutory amend-
ments which have made the State’s
company kw a model for the rest of
Australia. But he is not at all happy about
the Commonwealth Government’s pro-
posed restrictive trade practices legisla-
tion. His susp : cions have a twofold
source. Like most State politicians he
is opposed to further increases in
Federalism; and he believes that the
legislation, as so far outlined, would
unnecessarily interfere with legitimate
business.
Mr Rylah has referred to Australians
as the “victims of a form of shotgun
Federalism” and compares our system
unfavorably with what he saw in
Canada: “A healthy, consultative and co-
operative Federalism.” He wants “to
take powers away from the Federal Gov-
ernment, not increase them”. But more
than administrative ability and provincial
zeal is needed to make inroads on
Federal powers and policies. Mr Rylah
is widely reputed to be the “power be-
hind the throne” in Victorian politics.
He smiled when this rumor was put to
him: “Let’s say that Mr H. Bolte and I
make a team, and a happy one Don’t
forget that Mr Bolte is very good with
figures . . . Anyway, I believe that the
Premier should be a country bloke, if
possible.”

In Friendship’s Name
HThe word “friend” has acquired a new
shade of meaning in modern usage.
There was a good illustration of it in a
recent episode involving one of The
Rolling Stones.
The Stone in question was being sued
by a young lady named Linda who
alleged he was the father of her infant
son. He suggested that pending the hear-
ing of the case they take a holiday to-
gether in Tangier, and the plaintiff agreed
to do so. On returning from the holiday
she said she had had a wonderful time
and had decided not to proceed with the
paternity suit. A private settlement had
been arranged. Interviewers asked the
Stone if they intended to get married, but
he seemed shocked by the suggestion. He
said: “As far as Linda and I are con-
cerned, we are just friends.”
This statement moved me to wonder
what was the precise current meaning of
“friend”. The Oxford Dic-
tionary defines it as “one
joined to another in intim-
acy an I mutual benevolence
independently of sexual or
family love”. The first part
of the definition applies well
enough to the relationship
of the Stone and Linda.
They are evidently joined in
intimacy and since the settlement of
their legal differences mutual benev-
olence. But taking account of all the cir-
cumstances it seems plain that the Stone
used the word in a broader sense than
that of the Oxford Dictionary.
This liberal conception of friendship is
common among celebrated people. Some
years ago I used to take part in a tele-
vision interview programme on which
many of the guests were distinguished
visitors from abroad Whether they were
actors, actresses, singers, sportsmen, or
intellectuals, I noticed that there was
often an unobtrusive person of the
opposite sex who accompanied the guest
to the studio, and whose function was
not made clear. On inquiring I was told
invariably that this person was a friend.
American entertainers customarily take
a friend with them when they go on tour.
It is more convenient than having to make
a new friend in each place they visit.
One often reads in the Press a pronounce-
ment by some notable of show business,
who is travelling the world with a com-
panion, to the effect that they are “just
friends”. Miss Zs.. Zsa Gabor, in her hey-
day, was much given to such declarations.
Piecing the evidence together, one is
driven to conclude that in those circles
friendship is not necessarily “independ-
ent of sexual or family love”, as the
dictionary says.
Youthful entertainers such as The Roll-
ing Stones have professional reasons for
preferring the state of friendship to that
of marriage. Their public does not care
how many friends they have, but if
they marry even once it may reject them.
Reckless and premature matrimony
blighted poor Tommy Steele’s career in
the flower of his youth; whereas the
sagacious Elvis Presley, who has a wide
circle of friends, has prolonged his suc-
cess into middle age.
The new use of the word “friend”,
with its more intimate connotations, is
passing into standard English. Soon,
without doubt, we shall be reading in
works of history that Charles II was
friendly with Nell Gwynne, and that Nel-
son and Lady Hamilton were just friends.
In past times, as now, the famous and
influential were apt to make
friends easily. Nero, Louis
XV, and Catherine the
Great were all noted for
their friendly dispositions.
One should observe, how-
ever, that the phrase “just
friends”, while it implies a
very close association, re-
tains a qualified sound. It
suggests that the relationship is a com-
mon one, and nothing to get excited
about. When the Rolling Stone said he
and Linda were just friends, he left us
to infer that some more passionate kind
of attachment was possible. Perhaps
future writers will say that Romeo and
Juliet, or Antony and Cleopatra, were
more than just friends.
With the spread of the new usage
among ordinary folk, there has been
some natural confusion as to the mean-
ing of friendship. I heard of a case
where a youth said to a young woman,
with whom he had been arguing, “Let’s
be friends”. She slapped his face for
making what she considered an improper
suggestion. Another young man was in
trouble for addressing certain familiari-
ties to a girl employed in the medical
benefits office of the Manchester Unity.
He said in his defence that he heard
it was a friendly society.
The question arises: how does one now
describe persons of opposite sexes who
really are nc more than what used to be
called friends? Increasing ambiguity
attaches even to the familiar terms “boy-
friend” and “girl-friend”. The time is
coming when a revival of the innocuous
musical The Girl Friend might have
to be re-named The Girl Associate.

Ron’s Scientologists
" The Commies, the Socialists and the Catholics "
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard has not only visited the Van Allen Belt and Venus,
he has been to heaven: “The first time I arrived the moment was dated at
43,891,832,611,177 years, 10 hours, 20 minutes and 40 seconds from 10.2 and a half
p.m. daylight Greenwich time, May 9, 1963.”
The implant was electronic by nature
and arrival was by ship in the form of
a doll body. The gates of heaven were,
fortunately, open: “The gates of the first
series are well done, well built. An
avenue of statues of saints leads up to
them. The gate pillars are surmounted
by marble angels. The entering grounds
are very well kept, laid out like bush
gardens in Pasadena, so often seen in
the movies. Aside from the implant
boxes which lie across from each other
on the walk there are other noises and
sounds as though saints are defending
and berating.”
If that is heaven, who is Lafayette
Ronald Hubbard? Ron, as he is known
to his followers, is the founder and mes-
sianic father of Scientology, the organi-
sation which made the mistake, in this
very century and less than a decade ago,
of establishing headquarters in Spring
Street, Melbourne, directly opposite the
Victorian steps and columns of Par-
liament House. There it was, and is,
with its large “SCIENTOLOGY” sign
confronting every member of the State
Parliament and Treasury official who
uses the front stairs.
Somebody was bound to find out what
it meant and it was the Labor leader in
the Legislative Council, Mr Jack Gal-
bally, who found out first. Two years
ago he told the State Government that
it was a menace to the community, and,
challenged by the Government on what
could be done about it, produced a bill
forbidding Scientologists to charge for
their services.
The Liberal-Country Party Govern-
ment saw the force of his argument but
was reluctant to let him take the initiative
and decided to set up a Board of Inquiry
into Scientology. The board was consti-
tuted and appointed in the person of
Mr Kevin Anderson, QC, and it was
confidently predicted by State Cabinet
that the Labor thrust had been parried,
and that the whole inquiry would be over
and done with in a couple of months.
Two years, 151 witnesses, and nearly
4 million words later, the Board has re-
ported. At a cost of something more
than £50,000, Mr Anderson has found
that “Scientology is evil; its techniques
evil; its practice a serious threat to the
community medically, morally, and
socially; its adherents sadly deluded and
often mentally ill.”
And Ron Hubbard? “ . . . an Ameri-
can who now lives at Saint Hill Manor,
East Grinstead, Sussex, England, who
falsely claims academic and other dis-
tinctions, and whose sanity is gravely
to be doubted.”
By frequent and repeated reference to
his qualities, Hubbard has built for
himself in the eyes of his followers a
mighty image. The adulation and obeis-
ance, which they offer him, is almost un-
believable. Scientology students are
specifically taught that he is not God,
lest they think he is.
There is nothing Apollonian about his
appearance: “A solidly built man, per-
haps a little over average height with
sandy or red hair, thick but receding
slightly, and a broad face and ruddy
complexion.” The face is not to be
judged by the larger-than-life-size bronze
bust which stands in the reception office
of the Melbourne Scientology Institute,
slightly disfigured by the assault of a dis-
turbed client.
He is sceptical of all the established
orthodoxies, as befits a man who has
known the realms of both human and
divine scales of time. He is scornful of
doctors and psychiatrists and has on
more than one occasion unmasked the
conspiracy amongst his enemies: “These
howls come from both conservative and
liberal groups the AMA, the Com-
mies, the Socialists and the Roman
Catholics.”
Furthermore, says Mr Anderson:
“Much of Hubbard’s writings show a
morbid preoccupation with matters relat-
ing to the abnormal behavior of women,
sex, rape, abortions, and similar topics.”
Some of the evidence gathered by the
Board, and attached to the report as
Appendix 19, was forbidden publication
with the rest of the report by Victoria’s
Chief Secretary, Mr Rylah. Only mem-
bers of Parliament are allowed to see
this corrupting appendix.
Those who go to Scientology for assist-
ance (they are known as “pre-clears” in
the trade) are encouraged by their
“auditors” to speak freely, even with
abandon, about their past, especially
about those things which worry them
most and over which they feel most
guilt.
The only apparatus used in the proces-
sing is the E-Meter. This is a small elec-
tric meter housed in a wooden box, mea-
suring about 10 in. by 6 in. by 2 in. On
the top side is a dial with a moving
needle, some control knobs, and a rheo-
stat control called a “tone arm”. It has
two terminals, to each of which is attach-
ed, at the end of a lead, an electrode
which is a steel or tin can, resembling,
and sometimes actually being, a soup
can. Within the box are small batteries
and a transistorised circuit which is able
to record electrical resistance. During
the auditing process, the “pre-clear”
holds a can in each hand, whilst the

“auditor” asks questions and watches the
readings on the dial. The whole appara-
tus is like a primitive lie-detector.
The E-Meter is a reverent and myster-
ious thing with strange, magical powers.
It is also infallible. Hubbard has told
his disciples: “The E-Meter is never
wrong. It sees all. It knows all. It tells
everything.” Mr Anderson reports that
the E-Meter is supposed to provide con-
clusive evidence of the existence of “the-
tans” (spirits’ or souls’) past lives, and the
validity of Scientology theories.
Scientologists assert that if a “pre-
clear” is asked such a question as “have
you ever committed adultery”, and
there is a “read” on the meter, though
the “pre-clear” may answer “no”, adul-
tery of which the “thetan” is aware has
nevertheless been committed. Then, if
the same question is asked, but preceded
by the words “in this lifetime ...” and
there is no “read” on the meter, the
explanation is that the “thetan” was
aware of adultery in the lifetime of some
other body to which it had earlier been
assigned.
Apart from its supranatural powers,
the E-Meter has been found to exercise
a strong influence over those who have
submitted to Scientological auditing.
Mr Anderson claims that the meter en-
ables the Scientology Institute to assume,
intensify, and retain control over the
minds and wills of the “pre-clears”. Fear
of its abilities keeps them in constant
subjection. Its use can be so manipulated
that almost any desired result can be
obtained.
The revenue is not so bad, although,
as Ron explained when interviewed a few
days ago at his 18-room mansion, “Any
money we receive from people we use
in helping people. Nobody is getting
rich.” Perhaps Ron gets his private
money from book royalties: before in-
venting Scientology he used to write
science fiction.
Mr Anderson has found that many
people have paid large sums of money
to the Scientology Institute, “amounts
over £lOOO being not uncommon. The
hourly fates for processing range from
four and a half guineas downwards”
more than the fees of Collins St. den-
tists!
He also records that for the six
years ending in June 1964, the gross
income of the Scientology Institute was
over a quarter of a million pounds, on
which a flat 10 per cent levy was pay-
able to Hubbard’s headquarters in Eng-
land.
The expert psychiatric evidence, which
Mr Anderson obtained at his enquiry,
declared that Hubbard’s writings were
the product of a person of unsound
mind; and that he shows strong symp-
toms of paranoic schizophrenia.
No evidence of blackmail was present-
ed to the Board, but the fact that it
knows all his secrets, guilty or otherwise,
confers on the Scientology Institute great
power .and authority over the ‘pre-
c^ear *”
Mr Anderson recommends that the
best way to outlaw Scientology would be
to set up a Psychologists’ Registration
Board to lay down standards, and to dis-
qualify Scientologists from practising.
He also points out that this ‘evil practice
with evil techniques cannot be adequate-
ly dealt with by one State.
The Premier will discuss the possibility
of nationwide legislation at the next con-
ference between the Commonwealth and
States, and the chances of joint action,
based on the recommendations of the
Anderson Report, are strong.
The question that has not been raised
yet, however, is what is going to be done
for the mentally lame who fall for such
nonsense as Scientology. Much more
important than the issue of the banning
of Scientology is the problem of those
half-sick, half-neurotic persons who are
ever seeking—in some way or another,
and often through some form of quack-
ery mental comfort and stability,
The majority of le who have
, urned to Scientology are not certifi-
able and they are not the kinds of
peop | e who wi „ seek the assistance of a
State institution. Frequently they have an
aversion to psychiatrists, and in any case,
they usually have no notion that they are
mentally disturbed. Now that Scientology
has been disposed of we might well have
an inquiry into the nature, pathology,
and needs of its poor clients.

The Bubble Reputation
“A performance is a performance ”
From JAMES MURRAY in London
Australia’s pantheon of distin-
guished expatriates would not be
complete without a special niche
for Alan Freeman: a comedian has only
to mention Freeman’s name followed by
the word “white” to have Britons shake
with seismic laughter in their smallclothes
—more often than not washed in the
powder Freeman promoted to top-of-the-
sales graphs in three smiling years.
Shakespeare’s soldier sought the bubble
reputation even in the cannon’s mouth;
Melbourne’s Freeman, with a less fool-
hardy sense of the fitness of things, has
found it in a detergent packet. But he
makes it clear that he does not regard
himself merely as the tele-huckster of a
synthetic substitute for wood ash who
also happens to trigger a laughter reflex.
The decision to take on the promotion
of a washing powder was for him a
crucial one, he states. It meant combin-
ing the business of selling detergents to
mums with the more aesthetic activity
of playing pop discs to teenagers. And
at first his TV commercials did cost
him work as a disc jockey, but as he con-
tinued with them from 1963 through
1964 to 1965, he became a national mas-
cot “the satirist’s delight, the car-
toonists’ savior and the mums’ darling”
in the words of a blurb.
“A performance is a performance,”
is how Freeman himself explains his
breakthrough, stopping cne short of the
ultimate profundity Gertrude Stein
allowed herself.
Perhaps because he earns his crust
(in his case buttered with a Mini, a Mer-
cedes and £lB,OOO a year) by an awe-
some professional volubility, Freeman is
surprisingly ungarrulous, leaving you
with the impress on that if you looked
like a microphone, he might talk more
readily. “I’ve been lucky,” he says as he
returns after signing autographs for a
posse of his fans who have tracked him
to his fifth-storey, Maida Vale flat. To
stress the rainbow’s-end quality of his
luck he recalls that just over eight years
ago he was earning £5O a week on
station 3KZ, Victoria.
He repeats the station slogan, “The
Brighter Broadcasting Service”, with
nostalgia. It is a nostalgia he displays
for no other phenomenon of Australian
life except the skill of Lou Richards,
the sometime Collingwood footballer,
now landlord at the Phoenix Hotel, Mel-
bourne, student of the “Encyclopaedia
Britannica” and footy pundit. For Free-
man, distance has tended to lend disen-
chantment to the view. “The cultural
proximity of the Continent is a fascinat-
ing thing,” he says. “Even if you don’t
join in, it’s all happening. There’s some-
thing lacking in Australian culture.”
Freeman’s personal level of cultural
achievement means that he is now, at 38,
one of the top three disc jockeys in
Britain; above him Jimmy Saville, aged
42, the only father substitute outside of
Kraft-Ebbing with bleached ringlets, and
David Jacobs, aged 39, as'suave as Sav-
ille is synthetically farouche. That three
middle-aged blokes should be the chief
arbiters of a music which appeals to fans
of tender years is one of the minor
ironies of pop culture. Certainly it is
not one which troubles Freeman. What
he does recognise is that he is low man
on the pop totem pole, but clearly he
may change this. He listens to 60 new
releases a week and though he discounts
his personal influence, he spreads it in a
radio programme, a television pro-
gramme and twc magazine columns.
“Pop keeps you young. It keeps you
alert. You watch yourself and you watch
your dress,” he says with the conviction
of a with-it Athanasius trying out the
switched-on creed. “I don’t believe one
is God Almighty. I never use ‘great’,
‘fabulous’, ‘gear’ and fab’.” He rebuts
suggestions that pop music is artificially
created. “Pop records are full of ex-
citement. I have seen dedication, includ-
ing tears and frustration. I think people
feel pop music is artificial because it
makes a lot of money.” He scoffs at the
notion of payola for disc jockeys. He ad-
mits that “he has heard” of discs being
steered into the charts by the simple
expedient of interested parties buying
them up wholesale.
Freeman’s immediate plans include the
opening of a discotheque in partnership
with George Harrison of The Beatles. He
reckons that he may have four good
years left as a pop oracle even allow-
ing for the fact that he can relax by
going to Covent Garden to listen to
Callas and Sutherland. It is obviously
against the day of his abdication that
he has begun to venture into new fields.
One of these is films. Handsome, nug-
gety and mid-Atlantic, he began his
career as an actor tentatively, not to say
nervously, in “Dr Terror’s House of Hor-
rors”.
It is hardly astonishing, therefore, that
Freeman should say, when asked about
the possibilities of his returning to Aus-
tralia: “There just isn’t the same scope
there, is there?”


AROUND MELBOURNE
Marlene Dietrich and the Press Gang
“Not a vein in those legs”
A ll the rules were laid down as for
an entertainer of the very first
rank. Indeed the rules went even fur-
ther than those for Joan Sutherland
and The Beatles no airport inter-
views, no television at all, no radio
tapes, just one Press conference only,
at the Mayfair Room at the Southern
Cross Hotel, 4.45 p.m.
And that was indicative of rank.
No one had ever rated the Mayfair
Room before, in amongst the stuffed
cockatoos in cages and imitation
Carlton lacework iron. The arrange-
ments were good. A gentleman from
Aztec Services supervised the passing
of drinks and smoked salmon. JJe kept
shaking his head: “The first question
they asked when she arrived in Syd-
ney was, ‘What do you think of Aus-
tralia?' Aw, it happens every time.”
She arrived only 15 minutes late,
which was 15 minutes better than
Joan Sutherland, and infinitely
quicker than The Beatles. There was
a quick period for photographers,
which had to be all over before any
questions were asked. After five
minutes of camera clicking Marlene
Dietrich said: “If you don’t stop them
we'll be here ’til Christmas.” She made
abrupt movements, quick turn-on
smiles, swinging this way and that for
each camera. She sat down on a chair,
not on the orchestra stage, but in
front of it, and the smart characters
very nearly sprinted to get those seats
right in front of her.
Your correspondent managed to
get a front stall position about four
feet away. Her skirt slipped above
the knee and she twined those slim
legs one around the other like a
smooth, shapely, sheer-stockinged
grapevine. One stocking, incidentally,
had a ladder. There wasn’t a mark,
not a vein on those legs. It was fas-
cinating when she untwined and re-
twined the other way. Her figure
was perfect, as if it had been made
to measure by Vogue. She wore no
jewellery and very little make-up,
just a little around the eyes. Her skin
was very smooth, utterly white, and
she had a way of quizzically wrink-
ling her forehead when she looked so
directly at each questioner. Her age?
Indeterminate.
The fashion writers purred. One of
them kindly passed on the right in-
formation: “All right, take it down. It’s
a Chanel, the best. It’s oyster matelasse
satin, lined with navy blue satin, with
a navy blue satin blouse and matching
satin classic court shoes. Those stock-
ings are called ‘seamless nude’. God,
I wish I know how she kept her
legs like that.”
She didn’t give away many clues
about this eternal youth. There were
those who tried to approach with
subtlety. “Um-ah-forgive me for ask-
ing, but do you spend very much time
on grooming?”
“I have just spent two days in an
aeroplane. I have had time only to
wash my face, come downstairs and
see you.” There were those who
tried blunt, shock tactics. “Do you
wear a hair piece?” With magnificent
frigidity she looked straight back at
the questioner. “Do you?”
Her method of answering questions
was extraordinarily similar to that
of John Lennon of the Beatles. The
answers always were abrupt, brief,
not revealing a great deal of informa-
tion and often turned back at the
questioner. It was the technique of
a person answering questions that
had been asked a thousand times
before.
“Who is your favorite film star?”
“Cary Grant.”
“Why?”
She shrugs, “Cary Grant.”
“Do you have a sense of humor?”
“If I didn’t I wouldn’t be here.”
She was quite expressive and frank
about Germany. “The Nazis still don’t
like me. There are a lot of Nazis
still in Germany. Berlin is not so bad;
I think it’s worse in the Rhineland.”
She had a hostile reception in some
of the places she performed in West
Germany, and there were even bombs
planted in one theatre. But why did
she get such treatment? “Because I
left Germany when Hitler came to
power,’ and softly, in that husky
voice with a stiff smile, she said:
“They called me a traitor.”
We didn’t make a great deal of
progress on questions about her
family. “I can’t stand doting grand-
mothers,” and someone made the mis-
take of asking her about her grand-
children a second time. “Here we go
again,” she said. “They're 15, 13,
5 and 3.” Then there was the time
she made the appeal. “Isn’t somebody
going to ask me something about my
profession?”
She preferred working on a stage
to the movies. After all, movies were
not the same, they had deteriorated.
Anyway, not that many were being
made any more. The best films were
coming from France and Italy.
Paris is her favorite town. She
thinks Russia is beautiful, “particu-
larly the theatres”. She prefers Frank
Sinatra as a singer and, “I love the
Beatles. No, not any particular song,
just the whole idea, the feeling.”
She was particularly cold on ques-
tions about sex. She had never been
ti sex goddess. “A myth dreamed up
by the historians.” Her legs insured?
“Another myth.” Sex appeal? “That
word wasn't invented when I was in
films.” Her PR team had put for-
ward a story that her contract insisted
that her dressing room always provide
a special hook for her swansdown
coat, made from the breasts of 300.
“No, of course, that’s not in my
contract,” she said. “Is it even likely?
You don’t want to believe all you read
in the newspapers.”
But why did she do it all. She did
it because she liked to keep active
and she did it for the money. Alas,
nobody asked her why she needed
money. She was Germanic, utterly
efficient, the way she turned to each
questioner and answered all questions.
She showed the greatest feeling when
asked about the air trip. “It was
frightful, frightful. Once you could
get a bed in an aeroplane. Now you
sit in a chair, you can’t stretch out.
And after hours and hours when you
think you might get to sleep, at an
ungodly hour they turn on all the
lights and want to give you breakfast.
It was appalling.”

A disaster if the Soviet Union signs the
Universal Copyright Convention
From IRVING KRISTOL in New York
For many years now, American publishers and the US State Department,
too have been urging the Soviet authorities to sign the Universal Copyright
Convention. It is beginning to look as if this campaign might be victorious. And
it is my conviction that this victory would represent a moral disaster for the American
intellectual community and, eventually, for the publishing community as well. It
would also do a disservice to the most enterprising (and therefore least orthodox)
Russian writers.
The motivation of American publishers
and writers is as unambiguous as it is
shortsighted. It can be summed up in
one word: Money. And if any qualifica-
tion is needed, that can be summed up
in two phrases: (a) Lots of it, and (b) to
which they have an excellent moral claim.
More than 500 American scientific,
technical and professional books plus
a couple of hundred books of diverse
character are translated and published
in the Soviet Union each year. The size
of some of these editions, most notably
of textbooks but also of popular novels,
is enormous. Because the Soviet Govern-
ment is not a signatory to the Universal
Copyright Convention, foreign publishers
and authors receive not a penny in
royalties (except in occasional, and un-
predictable, instances). So it is not sur-
prising that there should be considerable
dissatisfaction with, and agitation against,
such a state of affairs. If the Soviet
authorities are ultimately persuaded, and
if they then sign up, many American pub-
lishers and authors would be handsomely
rewarded. That would be very nice
but one would quickly discover that a
lot of other consequences would not be
nearly so nice.
If the Soviet Union signs the Universal
Copyright Convention, then all American
publishers who wish to bring out an
American edition of a Soviet book will
have to sign a contract with the Soviet
international book agency, Mezhduna-
rodnaya Knjiga, or with an American
subsidiary of this organisation, for the
title in question. Except in the rarest
instances, they will not be able to sign
with the Soviet author directly. As the
contracting party, this branch of the
Soviet Government will exercise all of
the author’s prerogatives.
One such prerogative, of course, is the
decision to publish at all. Let us assume
that a Soviet novel, critical of some
aspects of Communist life and Com-
munist society, is published in a limited
edition in the USSR. If they are signa-
tories of the Universal Copyright Con-
vention, the Soviet authorities will be
free to decide that an American edition
is undesirable. There will then be no
American edition.
Another of the author’s prerogatives
is (or can be) to approve the translation
and all editorial matter (prefaces, intro-
ductions, notes, etc.) appended to the
foreign language edition. This means
that all Soviet books published in the
US will, in effect, have passed the censor-
ship of the Soviet cultural commissars.
They will be free to insist that certain
terms and phrases be translated in a
certain way. They will be free to delete
passages, or entire sections, from the
original. They will be free to insist on
having certain kinds of people write
certain kinds of “explanatory” prefaces.
Last week the NSW Milk Board
announced that it had decided not
to protest to a Moscow publishing
firm about the unlawful publication
in the Soviet Union of an Australian
textbook. The book, “Principles of
Mechanical Milking”, was reprinted
in Moscow recently without the per-
mission of either the NSW Milk
Board or the author, Dr W. G.
Whittleston.
The case again raises the issue
of Soviet pirating of foreign books
—most notably American books—
and the possibility that the Soviet
Union may soon sign the Universal
Copyright Convention.
In this article the American
writer Irving Kristol hopes that it
will not.
The Soviet writers wilt have nothing to
say about this; in effect, we shall be
collaborating with their political bosses
to control the publication of their books
abroad.
Is this a fanciful exaggeration? The
French experience would seem to indicate
that it is not.
French law has always been zealous in,
protecting the legal rights of foreigners,
and up until last year it prescribed that
French publishers had to behave as if
Russia were a signatory to the Copy-
right Convention that is, they had to
deal with accredited Soviet representa-
tives and organisations, pay royalties to
them, and so on. How did the experi-
ment work?
It worked horribly. The Russians
established a French organisation, run
by Communists and fellow-travellers, to
deal with French publishers. This or-
ganisation chose the translators and pro-
vided “suitable” editorial material. If
one French publisher balked there was
always another with an eye on the main
chance. There was only one French
edition of “One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich” (the sole country where this
was the case) and it contained a preface
by Pierre Daix, who until Khrush-
chev’s Secret Speech had for years
stoutly denied the very existence of con-
centration camps in the Soviet Union,
and who edits a Communist literary jour-
nal. During the six months from Janu-
ary, 1964, through June, 1964, when
“modernism” was under attack by the
Soviet authorities, translations of Soviet
“modernists” were not delivered to
French publishers who had contracted
for them. They were mysteriously delayed
until the party line had softened.
Last year the French repealed their
law. In part, they did so because the
Russians still obstinately refused to
reciprocate by paying royalties to French
publishers and authors on translations 1
into, the Russian. Another reason for the
repeal was General de Gaulle’s irritation
at the fact that not only Jiad he never
received royalties on the Russian trans-
lation of a volume of his memoirs but
the preface to the volume in question
was disagreeable and some sections un-
flattering to Russian sensibilities were
deleted. The main reason the French
acted as they did, however, was that the
whole situation had become intolerable
and had given rise to a public scandal.
It would make sense if American
publishers and writers were to try to
establish some kind of bilateral arrange-
ment with the Soviet Union, covering
only the reciprocal payment of royalties.
But actually to invite the USSR to obtain
control over the publication and distri-
bution of its literature abroad this is
the kind of farce that so often precedes
a genuine tragedy.


Letters to the Editor
Mr Lee and the Americans
SIR. —Professor Tregonning's article on Mr Lee
Kuan Yew and the Americans (8., Sept. 25)
is the most illuminating and rational analysis
published so far of Mr Lee's now-famous
criticism of the US. Professor Tregonning's
position as a scholar of history, his know-
ledge of the local people and his long resi-
dence in this part of the world make him
eminently qualified to comment on the subject.
Many American newspapers and journals
have commented on Mr Lee's statements
about the Americans. They all point to the
inevitable conclusion that the Premier was
merely attacking the US to gain Afro-Asian
recognition and support. Anyone who has
made a careful study of the political career
of Lee Kuan Yew will agree with Professor
Tregonning that this interpretation insults the
intelligence of the man. When Lee Kuan Yew
made those fateful remarks about the Ameri-
cans on TV recently he was in fact voicing
the sentiments of thousands of Singaporeans
and Malaysians—who though politically
separated, are, after all, one and the same
people. One has only to speak to any edu-
cated man-in-the-street in Singapore or
Malaysia to find out how low the Americans
rate in his opinion in the field of diplomacy
■and international affairs.
One of the cornerstones of American for-
eign policy is the support of any political
faction which is the most vocal in its con-
demnation of the Communists, regardless of
whether that faction enjoys popular sup-
port. It is just this policy, coupled with the
American mania of equating anything and
everything Chinese with Communism, that
may precipitate a clash between the two
major races in Malaysia with possible reper-
cussions in Singapore. Under such circum-
stances American intervention cannot be
ruled out. Those who think that Lee Kuan
Yew was merely lashing out at the favorite
"whipping boy" of international politics
would do well to make a careful study of
Professor Tregonning's analysis of the
situation.

The Fertiliser Co-operative
SIR. -v- Under the above heading in your is-
sue of September 25, you ask "Can Farmers'
Co-operative Fertilisers (Euroa) Ltd make a
go of it?" You then refer to evidence in
J. C. Horsfall's article of September 11 of
activity by the major existing superphosphate
producer ICIANZ designed to remove
this threat of competition from a new pro-
ducer to be owned by the users themselves.
The claim that "every economic argument is
against an inland super works becoming a
paying proposition" looks as if it too may
have come from a similarly biased source.
It is surely an obvious fact that overall
costs must be less if the works are closer to
the place where the finished product is
needed, than if they are at the seaboard,
because from every 73 tons of raw material
(phosphate rock and sulphur), you get 100
tons of super. The company doesn't aim to
supply the whole of Australia, or even the
whole of Victoria only north and north-
eastern Victoria and the Riverina; so there
is a freight saving equal to the cost of trans-
porting the difference between 73 tons and
100 tons from the seaboard to the inland area
to be serviced.
Euroa, like ICIANZ, will import its sulphur
(none is produced in Australia). It will pro-
duce its sulphuric acid in a plant embodying
the very latest and best practice in the world
—and will thus be a jump ahead of the
older-established plants. The heat generated
in the production of the sulphuric acid will
be converted, via a steam-driven turbo-alter-
nator, into the power that will drive the plant.
So much for the idea that Euroa will not
"be in as good a position to buy it (sulphuric
acid) as ICIANZ".

Crossword for Morons
SIR. Over the years "The Bulletin" has
continued to publish the cleverest crossword
puzzle of any Australian journal always
challengingly difficult of solution. But oh! the
latest (No. 866)! A moron could solve it
with ease. Please, please give us no more
such kindergarten stuff.

A Word From Polonius
SIR. —Mr Lloyd Martin's explanation of his
failures of the past season (8., Sept. 25) is
typical of the half-truths I have observed
Australian managements giving their more
deserving public. Surely Mr Martin did not
purchase the rights to "Fade Out, Fade In"
without knowing that its original New York
showing had been damned by the critics
and only drew audiences because of the
presence of a major TV star that the masses
wanted to see in the flesh. Mr Martin must
have been aware that the moment that this
star left the show attendance dropped over
eighty per cent.
How could Mr Martin ignore the fact that
Mr Max Bygraves' strict adherence to a
worn and tired variety act had lost him
most of his great following in the UK in
spite of his continued professional polish.
In summarily dismissing "Fiddler On The
Roof", Mr Martin has either little faith in the
intelligence of the Australian public or a
definite personal lack of theatrical judgment.
To not report the beauty of the story, music,
humor, lyrics, dances, settings and the fan-
tastic number of awards harvested by this
show from dozens of professional and re-
ligious (other than Jewish) organisations is
to be dishonest. "Funny Girl" may not be
the greatest musical of all time, but it can-
not be dismissed as a companion in worth-
lessness to "Fade Out, Fade In" on the
basis that both deal with show business.
"Funny Girl" is the true story of a tragic-
comic figure of a woman, OF the theatre,
admirably played by Barbra Streisand, but
providing her with an abundance of good
material aid. Here is truth as opposed to
"Fade Out, Fade In's" utter dishonesty.
Mr Martin should go back to his precepts:
"Sydney and Melbourne are not very dif-
ferent", "Talent will out", "Either you have
a success or you don't", and perhaps add
one of Polonius' (with apologies to W.S.),
"To thine own self be true and pray
God to the Australian public too"!

Market Research
SlR.—Readers would be pardoned if Mr Vic-
tor Worstead's article (B„ October 2) left them
uncertain whether market research practices
in this country were in fact making any sig-
nificant contribution to the economy through
improving marketing practices. They could
also be pardoned if they felt that market
research executives were insufficiently trained
and interviewers inadequately directed.
A positive answer can however be given
on all these points. Market research practice
in Australia is making a substantial contri-
bution to raising the standard of goods and
services offered to consumers. It is making
a contribution io the economy by preventing
some ventures taking place which would have
failed with consequent loss of employment
and loss of income to companies involved.
Its major executives are highly qualified in
their own right and today have many years
of market research experience behind them.
In terms of contribution to quality of pro-
ducts one can indicate that the major food
processing companies continually test their
products. Consumers are very sensitive to
food flavors and qualities of processed pro-
ducts, and their views are continually sought
through controlled household product tests.
Australian Consumer Mail Panels, for instance,
a subsidiary of Australian Sales Research
Bureau Pty Ltd, during a period of six months
recently, despatched by post alone five tons
of canned food products to the several thou-
sand members of its panel in a series of
controlled tests. Many tons of products were
delivered personally by interviewers to con-
sumers' homes for the same reasons. These
tests have led to continual changes in the
standards of the products offered to consum-
ers.
In general then, market research in Aus-
tralia is doing a useful job for those indus-
tries employing it and the quotation attri-
buted to Dr Nowick is, to say the least, a
cynical one. One Would have to ask what
was Dr Nowick's criterion for a survey to be
successful? If he looks for every survey to
yield useful information on every point en-
quired about, then, indeed, he would be hard
put to it to find a perfect survey. If however
he takes an economist's view of the matters,
then he would have no difficulty in finding
many of the best known companies in this
country who could assure him that the money
they spent on market research during the
course of the year more than paid for itself.
What was also lacking in your writer's
articles was any assessment of present ex-
penditure on market research or the rate of
growth of the industry. While no accurate
figures are available, informed opinion within
the profession is that approximately £1,500,000
is spent on independent market research
audience rating and retail audit companies
combined each year. Further, the total num-
ber of interviews, consumer, retail, whole-
sale and factory, are estimated at 400,000
a year. These are substantial figures. When
one further adds to these the total expendi-
ture by advertising agencies on their market
research departments, bv manufacturers on
their market research departments, then the
total expenditure overall can be seen to be
quite substantial.

GRANDFATHER'S
SOCIALISM
A SHORT STORY BY JOHN GALE
Our neighbors in Jogjakarta always
came to us with their family prob-
lems, thinking that we could offer
consolation and advice in the light of
our recent misfortunes. Our next-door
neighbor had just sat herself beside me
on the back step, lamenting that her
eldest daughter wanted to marry a Com-
munist student. She was more afraid of
town gossip than of Communism, and 1
was reminded once again that our family
had been the object of gossip for years,
all because of my grandfather and my
sister.
We hadn’t been to my grandfather’s
house for two years, ever since his sec-
ond marriage, and my sister Tini, two
years older than I, had run off to
Djakarta shortly afterwards. We hadn’t
seen her since then either.
I had married a year ago. When I
visited my parents Tini and grandfather
were never mentioned. It was sad that
our family, which had been a model of
Javanese traditions, was being torn apart
in the name of “the new society”.
Mother had first discovered that Tini
was keeping company with an unsuitable
boy about three years ago. -
“A Roman Catholic and a Batak,” she
wailed to us. Most of the Bataks in Cen-
tral Sumatra were Christianized by the
Dutch before Islam could reach them.
“Barbarians,” mother cried. “Your fath-
er’s good name, and what'll your grand-
father say?”
Father promptly quoted the Koran
about obedient daughters and forbade
Tini to have anything more to do with
the Catholic Sumatran. But Tini, usual-
ly a model daughter, was stubborn. The
older generation would have blamed
higher education. Six months later, Tini
was bold enough to let her Joseph escort
her home from class.
Mother was furious. “Tell the chauf-
feur to get the car out,” she said to
me.
Mother always drove to grandfather’s
for consultation in times of crisis. He
was the head of our family, and very
wise.
Grandfather was the richest man in
Java, not counting the cabinet ministers
and the President, and when he walked
down Malioboro, people he didn’t even
know bowed to him. They even bowed
to us, too, sometimes. Grandfather was
responsible for the conduct of all his
children, and their husbands and wives,
and his grandchildren. He even had the
last word in the naming of babies. He
had ruled alone over more than 70
people ever since his wife had died ten
years ago.
We five children one of us was
married then were shocked at the
news of Tini’s blatant defection from
Islam and her Javanese upbringing.
Father was at tennis that afternoon,
when Joseph rode home with Tini, so
we delegated Martani, the oldest, to
speak to her. Tini had let us down bad-
ly-
Martani was engaged to a very re-
spectable boy from Djakarta. Father lik-
ed him because he was a devout Muslim.
But Martani was 28 and should have had
at least three babies. Poor mother. The
oldest of her own sisters and brothers
and the last to become a grandmother.
But Idrus, Martani’s beau, had been ac-
tive during the revolution and was late
finishing his studies at medical school.
Father had offered to finance his studies
and give him an allowance, if he mar-
ried Martani straightaway, but Idrus re-
fused. If he couldn’t support his own
wife, he’d rather not marry, he said.
He was the independent type. And father
had to agree. Father considered himself
a modern and insisted that all his child-
ren get a university education. Indo-
nesia’s future lay in education, he said.
Father’s brother married his children
off as soon as they were old enough, even
chose their husbands for them. We all
felt a smug kind of pity for a cousin
who had just married a very rich boy
she had never even seen before the be-
trothal.
We at least were allowed to choose our
own husbands, as long as they were Mus-
lim and from the same class.
“Tini, the whole town is talking about
us. How can you be so wicked? Have
you forgotten your Koran?” Martani
was allowed to get angry. She was the
oldest and had to keep us in order.
“Bataks are barbarians. They eat pork
and dog meat, black dogs. And you
would be the one who’d have to cook it
for him and his savage friends. Ugh,
dog for dinner.”
Tini was crying. It was a horrible
thought, eating dog.
“And their manners,” Martani pres-
sed on. “They talk with their mouths
full, and don’t know the meaning of
cleanliness. You would be too ashamed
to bring him into polite company.
They’re not even fit to be servants.”
Tini was still a Javanese, in spite of
it all, and she didn’t lose her temper
with her older sister.
Instead, she lowered her eyes. “And
when is Idrus going to marry you, if
ever? You’ve been waiting for four
years,” she said.
Martani was furious. “Grandfather will
never agree to your marrying that bar-
barian Sumatran, and without grandfath-
er’s consent, nothing can happen.”
That night, Tini was summoned to our
parents’ room. We stretched our ears to
hear what was going on. Grandfather
must have solved the problem somehow.
He always knew what was best. He even
knew the President well enough to call
him “Bung”, and the President had to
call him “brother”, out of respect.
We heard Tini pleading. “He will con-
vert to Islam. It’s Indonesian socialism
to marry outside our own ethnic group.
President Sukarno himself has said so.”
Our youngest sister, who had just
started studying civics, turned to me.
“That’s true, Sri. He has often said
that inter-marriage helps our country
advance. ‘There will be no racial, re-
ligious or class discrimination’,” she re-
cited. “And that Javanese girl from
Tjeribon got a special letter from the
President when she married a West Irian
boy. Everyone knows how uncivilized
the Irianese are. Why shouldn’t Tini
marry Joseph? It’s Indonesian socialism.
Besides, General Nasution is a Batak.”
Martani knew the answer. She sound-
ed like a text-book, “Indonesian social-
ism is all very well, but it doesn’t mean
that you have to love a hundred million
people enough to marry every one of

'with the Tini affair. After they had
"driven off, Martani said awkwardly, “Do
you want to know where they’ve gone?”
I shrugged.
“To Magelang. To the Sastras,” she
said.
I knew that Mr Sastra was a business
friend of father’s.
■ “Mr Sastra asked grandfather if his
son could marry one of his granddaught-
ers,” she went on. “Grandfather has
chosen Tini. They’ve gone to introduce
her to the boy.”
I was horrified. A forced marriage.
“It’s only right, Sri. If a girl is in-
capable of choosing a husband for her-
self. her father must do it for her.”
Martani’s voice trembled. I think she
had been as shocked as I.
I was upset. Why couldn’t the Sastra
boy find his own wife? What was wrong
With him? Perhaps he was cross-eyed
Perhaps he had his cross-eyes on grand-
father’s money. But what did it matter,
as long as the thing was settled and
people stopped talking about us.
I had known whom I would marry for
years, and grandfather approved. But I
had to wait for my two elder sisters to
marry first. It wasn’t fair. Everything
seemed to be going wrong with our
family. We had been considered the
ideal family. Six educated children, with
grandfather’s good name and money,
and father’s religion.
After the first Magelang trip, the Tini
affair quietened down. Things went back
to normal, or so it seemed. The Sastras
sometimes visited our house, and we
often made the trip to Magelang.
Then one evening, mother came home
from grandfather’s house. She had been
crying and didn’t emerge from her room
till after dinner. Grandfather had asked
her to come, to discuss his will, we had
thought. We assembled in the living-
room. anxious to hear what had hap-
pened.
“Your grandfather has married again,
this afternoon,” mother told us. “Inem
is your new grandmother.”
Inem was the 18-year-old servant girl
who worked in the laundry at grand-
father’s house. She was a peasant who
couldn’t even read and spoke only low
Javanese.
Grandfather had told mother that he
was lonely, and that it was all in the
cause of Indonesian socialism.
Tini married Joseph the following
week.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Stuffed Trophies on the Wall
of a Lost Empire
From ROBERT HUGHES in London
It would be neat to report that the
1965 Commonwealth Arts Festival
was either a success or a flop. It was
neither. It was a pseudo-event. There
seemed to be no reason for the festival
the situation had neither logic nor
spontaneity. Works of art were shown,
not because they were good, but because
they fitted political boundaries. What is
achieved by comparing the top artist
of British Guiana with the Robert
Rauschenberg of Fiji or the Picasso of
the Leeward Islands? Commonwealth
artists have nothing in common except
a trade agreement, and if the festival
was meant to show some energy shared
among them, it failed
All the festival revealed was the
obstinacy of culture, which will not
follow frontiers. Nothing, not even the
rhetoric of politicians, can bridge the
gulf between the fat, black mammas
dancing in Trafalgar Square and the
homosexual of Robert Helpmann’s
ballet, "The Display”.
In the Royal Academy, the Common-
wealth countries laid out their wares,
but they only revealed one theme the
whistling gap which separates one pro-
vince from its political ally. Australia
had several exhibitions more or less
connected with the festival, but this
official one in the Royal Academy was a
failure. One would be tempted to say,
a disaster: but it wasn’t i. big enough deal
for that. The show was too small to
represent what has been painted in Aus-
tralia; it tried to please all tastes, it was
a damp compromise.
To hang a panel of garish little water-
colors by those dusky Poussins of Morris
Soak, the Namatjira tribe, next to a
handsome Brett Whiteley, undercuts any
aesthetic standards which Australia has
evolved, because it reflects our old be-
setting failure to distinguish the values
of Frank Clune from those of Patrick
White. I expected to see a diorama of
Eucumbene Dam round the corner. The
thing was a trade fair, not an art exhibi-
tion.
There was even a concealed loud-
speaker which, at intervals, emitted a
nasal rendition of “The Wild Colonial
Boy”. This hammering illusion of
frontier life drowned out a number of
good paintings in the room—three Drys-
dales, the Whiteley (a brilliant essay in
tension between lumpish, white body-
shapes sprawled in the corners of a field
of neutral white canvas) and a luscious
set of ceramic panels, Romeo and Juliet
adrift in an erotic sea of green-blue
glazes, by Arthur Boyd. Paintings, no
matter what their merit, can be under-
cut by bad presentation especially
when they are exhibited as stuffed
trophies on the wall of a lost Empire.
The Qantas Gallery had an exhibition
of William Dobell’s painting. It was
opened by Lord Snow. C. P. Snow is
the nearest thing to Andre Malraux in
England. I mean that, like Malraux, he
has a weighty official presence, an air of
cultural finality (White Chief, he speak),
and a taste for rhetoric. When Malraux
orates — and all his writing is oration
you enjoy the performance because,
although bombastic, and despite its lack
of intellectual content, it is a kind of
art — classical French rhetoric, inherited
from Racine.
But when C. P. Snow speaks, he is on
his own. He is aware of what he calls
“a right to his own cliches”, and cliche
thought pervaded what he had to say in
the Qantas Gallery. His point was that
Australia is the only country in the
world which has in recent years produced
a distinctive school of national painting.
This statement has been repeated so
often that it is threadbare, and anyway
it is not true, as a look at American art
will show.
Belief in the virtues of a national
school was exactly what led to the dis-
appointment of so many minor Aus-
tralian painters in London. They arrived
thinking that being born in Australia
gave them an aura, and found that Lon-
don was interested in art, the quality of
the work. The days of exotica were
numbered when they began. Now they
are over. It is no longer relevant that
an artist is Australian. His passport is
what his paint can do.
We are a country without tradition,
but we have invented an old master for
ourselves: Dobell. There has to come a
time when the culture hero, like Sieg-
fried, rides out to challenge history.
Would England, too, think Dobell a great
painter? Would he come back, linked
arm in arm with Goya, Rembrandt,
Hogarth and all the other great ghosts
to whom Australian critics had so freely
compared him?
It is difficult, living in Australia, tJ
appraise Dobell justly for two reasons!
First, there is the spray of publicity iij
which he and his work are drenched. All)
criticism of Dobell starts from thej
assumption that the man’s a genius, any]
way. You can say anything you like'
about his paintings provided that you
agree they’re great. The myth of
Dobell’s genius has become an ingrown
part of our national self-esteem.
The second reason is that Dobell is
praised in a vacuum. He is interminably
compared to Goya and Rembrandt. I
think it is unfair to criticise Dobell by the
standards one inherits from Goya or
Rembrandt. There is hardly a living
painter whose work would not buckle)
under the weight of that comparison, but
since Dobell’s acolytes insist that it can
be done, let us try it.
Discussions of Dobell often start by
praising his grasp of character, a basic
requirement for major portraiture. Now
a painting like The Cypriot has, like a
lot of Dobell’s best work, that grip. Thtf
test of Dobell’s art is its tough-minded-
ness: he interrogates his subjects and, at
least until ten years ago, he seldom
flattered them. But when you see a
series of Dobells, you realise how early
his mannerisms hardened. The quirk of
the lip, the lifted eyebrow, the quizzical
droop of the eyelids—these became an
obsessive mask, which stares back at
you and reveals nothing except Dobell’s
own handwriting
Dobell’s images have always been
vulnerable to style He belongs to a
mannerist tradition. His taste for the
vulgar conceals this, it gives those rather
uncommitted heads a look of robust
vitality, so does his florid and elegant
paintwork. All his life, Dobell has been
a manufacturer of handsome objects, not
a psychological portraitist. And to com-
pare this kind of image with the relent-
less self-questioning, the peeling-away of
the body, that Rembrandt achieved in his
self-portraits, is to reveal the difference
between two types of painter.
Dobell is a superficial portraitist be-
cause he has no vision of evil, and hence
no grasp of the tensions in man’s soul.
He is praised as a social satirist (Goya is
invoked here), but his eye is mild and
essentially bourgeois. It picks foibles
the fat lady at the restaurant table the
baroque, bald-turkey wattles of Mrs
South Kensington —but never draws up
a real indictment. One exception may be
the grotesque, teetering nude in The
Duchess Disrobes. But moral rage?
Never.
Dobell is a sound, impressive drafts-
man, but he is no inventor of forms.
Only rarely does he produce a shape


n
'which is interesting in itself. Most of
[them are flaccid. I can only think of
(the Cypriot's olue shirt with its balloon-
ing sleeves, and the head and figure of
I The Strapper, as exceptions tc this. He
can make a skin of paint come alive with
infinite vibrations of texture, but that is
not the same thing. And all too often in
his later work the light has gone soft,
;*sweet, unctuous.
| In short, if Dobell's London exhibi-
tion showed anything, it was the in-
adequacy of the claims made for him.
|He is not a painter of international
I stature, but an eclectic, a mixture of
itimidity and flash. Dobell has painted
(some highly pleasing pictures, and had
i moments of real insight (The Cypriot, on
that score, is his masterpiece), but his
work adds little to the tradition on which
it rightly depends, though he is still one
of the best painters ever to come out of
Australia and, indeed, one can’t imagine
dhe shape of Australian culture without
him.
Russell Drysdale’s show at the
Leicester Galleries was his first in Lon-
don for several years. A number of the
reservations one has about Dobell also
to Drysdale. Drysdale is often
Upraised for the wrong reasons. People
; think there is a tragic dimension to his
work. In fact, it is a tragedy-substitute,
-because Drysdale hasn't a vision of evil,
either. The gaunt men and the hot land-
scape are not in conflict. They belong to
one another, and Drysdale's image of the
outback is really an Arcadia with
scrawny black nymphs, squinting swains
in moleskins, and the heat turned up to
98 degrees. This may sound flippant
but it is not. I know of no living land-
scape painter whose vision of man and
nature is so genuinely Arcadian
All the elements are there nostalgia
for simplicity and innocence, faith in
pioneer virtue, timelessness, the decora-
tive presence of death: the bullocks’
skulls and dead trees in Drysdale’s
pictures serve exactly the same purpose
as the skull-bedecked tomb in Poussin's
Arcady. Even the space stepped back-
wards in carefully organised planes and
held in at the sides by repoussoir figures.
Using this simple framework, Drysdale
has given a unique contribution to Aus-
tralian art. Everyone knows what the
Drysdale landscape looks like. They may
never have visited it but they carry it
at the back of their minds. So Drysdale
has become that imperilled figure, a
genuinely popular painter. He is prag-
matic and sentimental a combination
which Australians go for.
Also, his work is easy to parody.
Drysdale’s difficulty, on the evidence of
this show, is that he parodies it himself.
There are some paintings that look like
caricatures of a Drysdale. Never were
the reds so hot, the colors so saturated,
the groups of stockmen so isolated in
their mutual desert. Drysdale’s forms,
little Dobell's, lean towards banality
sometimes, and his sense of theatre can

be overpowering. (It is interesting that
Drysdale’s groups have the transient
focus of actors on stage, and that most
of their gestures are poses.)
But for all this, Drysdale’s vision is
real. He forces us to accept his experi-
ences, to enter his world. And though
his Leicester exhibition was patchy, it
was incomparably better-knit than any-
thing I have seen from Drysdale’s hand
in the last three years. He has come out
of a long crisis in his art and his life
with his imagination intact even puri-
fied.
Light on Dark Corners
From JOAN LONG in London
Commonwealth Film Festival
A has shed light on dark corners
in more senses than one, and the most
interesting thing its spotlight has re-
vealed is the lonely eminence of the
Indian director Satyajit Ray, both in his
own country and over all the other
countries represented. His “Charulata”
is possibly his best film so far; the one
which most perfectly fuses those qualities
which go to make the film director’s art.
The film part of the Commonwealth
Festival seems to have been an after-
thought to the Festival proper. The or-
ganisers went for quantity rather than
quality: at least 80 programmes of films
were shown m 14 different places in two
weeks. To have seen them all would
have necessitated a non-stop dash from
one point in central London to another.
This, I think, was a mistake The organis-
ers may have been imbued with evan-
gelic zeal, but to the public there was no
sense of a Festival at all. Audiences were
sparse, apart from those at the National
Film Theatre, which showed the main
feature films, and advertised them as part
of its regular programmes.
“Charulata”, set in Calcutta in 1880,
is based on a novel by Tagore, the story
of a young wife who falls in iove with
her husband’s fri'end (who is also his
cousin). Visually it is the most elegantly
composed of Ray’s films. The scene
moves only occasionally from the interior
and garden of a large Victorian house,
reminiscent, with its wide, columned
veranda and lacy ironwork, of Aus-
tralian late 19th-century architecture.
There is more intricately plotted camera-
work than I remember Ray using be-
fore, and some beautiful use of repe-
tition, especially in a sequence near the
beginning, of the bored Charu moving
from window to window to look at the
street scene below. Ray uses these tech-
niques always to heighten an emotional
effect. They are never distracting, and,
combined with the ability to win very
subtle performances from his actors,
which has always been his great strength,
they give “Charulata” a special distinc-
tion.
Just how far Ray’s films stand above
the rest of the national product could
be gauged from another feature, “Woh
Kaun Thi”, which from all accounts ap-
pears to be typical of a large proportion
of Indian films. It has everything: an
Indian equivalent of Dr Kildare as hero,
a mysterious murder, intrigue over a
legacy, a haunted house always accom-
panied on the sound track by the howling
of wolves and the screams of bats, a
hospital dance where the hero took the
lead in a cabaret song-and-dance act,
and a heroine who kept appearing as a
wandering spirit in the oddest places, in-
variably bursting into song with full
amplified sitar, tambur and tabla accom-
paniment. After two hours of this the
hero moved co Simla to escape her, but
she popped up there, too, wandering
through the snows in a white sari, sing-
ing as she went. As I left, the distracted
doctor was on his way to consult the
local wise man, and no wonder.
The Pakistan entry, “Sooterang”, has
a few of the same ingredients the
melodrama and the singing but with-
out the vulgarity of the Indian film. It
is crudely made, but manages to be
touching at times: the story of a village
lad who goes to the city to save up
enough money to marry his sweetheart,
only to find on his return that her father
has married her to someone else, and
a scoundrel at that.
Ray’s influence was discernible, and
all to the good, in “Gamperaliya”, from
Ceylon, directed by Lester J. Peries, a
Sinhalese Catholic film-maker who
stands as far above the other film-make*
of his country as Ray does above hi|
Again the story hinges on the conflic*
and disappointments of the traditional!
arranged marriage. It is astonishing It
read that the actors are mostly non-prc
fessionals: Peries has married them t
their environments so effectively that vi
feel a sense of inevitability as their live
unfold.
Some of the visuals have a breatl
taking beauty. Much of the action
photographed on the wide veranda c
an old country house. The impressio
is of pale greys and whites, of the vertic:
lines of the thick white veranda pillar
echoed mistily by the vertical lines o
the slender trees in the grounds beyonc
For my taste the film is a little long an
sprawling, and it never quite achieves th
emotional strength of a Ray film, but
is heartening to see such a product frot
a country where film-making resource
are very limited.
The only feature from an Africai
country was “Harnile”, Shakespeare
“Hamlet” performed in English b
Ghanaians in a local setting and in Ioca
dress. It was a mistake. Expectations tha
the decorated mud compound and th
exotic clothes might have given the pla
a new dimension were soon dispellec
It was like watching a school perform
ance of Shakespeare: a very good try
but not good enough to avoid embaf
rassment. The direction, by England’
Terry Bishop, was static and stagey.
The Canadians seem to have reachec
a curious point in their film-makin
where they are in danger of falling be
tween two stools. Their technical abilit
has advanced beyond the needs of docu
mentary, but they cannot quite take the
plunge into features. Their main entry
“The Happy Life of Leopold Z” (in
French), had something in common with
"Caroline" also in the Festival. Techni-
cally there is no other Commonwealth
country to touch them Lheir direction is
sophisticated, the camera-work elaborate
they are full of clever, original ideas
But neither film is funny enough to be
straight comedy, nor moving enough to
be tragi-comedy If you’re going to spent
all that money and effort, why not spend
just a little more and make proper
features? There must be some very frus-
trated directors in Canada.
The main item on the AustraHan pro-
gramme at the National Film Theatre
was a full-length musical comedy in
color, “Funny Things Happen Down
Under”, made by two New Zealanders
Roger Mirams and Joe McCormick, who
have set up film-making in Melbourne.
Australian and New Zealand cameramen
have always been happiest out-of-doors
and the country setting, together with
the spontaneous performances won from
the young cast (most of them from

TELEVISION
One Man’s Meat
'Dritish television drama seems to
, arouse strong feelings, for or against.
One of the most virulent reactions in a
",long time was a Sydney critic’s comment
J on last week’s episode in the “Detective”
series, a drama called “The Hungry
Spider”, based on a Selwyn Jepson story,
"and featuring a modern amateur sleuth
fnamed Eve Gill.
' The drama was filmed in the usual
television way, with light values
s Hanging from mist grey to almost pitch
black. The characters were a “noisome
swarm of revolting drones, a lethal step-
-mother, a howling psychotic of a son, a
“quite silly detective who plied women
‘with brandy, and a nasty young blonde
y. . . a sickening young woman, most of
whose time was occupied distributing her
dubious favors among lickerish young
’men.”
In fact, the detective offered Eve one
■brandy, possibly because she was his
and her charms were distributed
, between him and no one else but the
“howling psychotic” at whom she smiled
once. Otherwise she was a fairly average
j thin, blonde girl with the lank hair
jmany of the young affect these days, in
l> London and Sydney and Melbourne. 1
I “mention these facts only to indicate what
. extremes the reaction to British drama
can reach.
“The Hungry Spider” was not a won-
derful drama but in my book worth at
: least three episodes of “Burke’s Law”,
i,which is still running in Melbourne, and
six episodes of “The Reporter”,
which features a really silly amateur
sleuth camouflaged as an even sillier
newspaperman.
Personally, I am glad to find on tele-
vision such British shows as “Detective”,
“The Human Jungle”, “Inter-
national Theatre”, “Danger Man”,
i“Undermind”. “The Saint”, and one to
come, “Gideon’s Way”, previewed last
week. Six or seven hours of British
drama in a total of 31 one-hour dramas
is surely not too much. Most of the
shows are reasonably good television,
and four are on commercial channels.
None of them reaches the heights of
some American series in photography,
dressing, effective dialogue, and acting.
But several of the British shows have
elements of true-to-life, of honest dia-
logue, and of calling a spade a spade,
matters which will please some viewers
and, as we have seen, arouse violent dis-
taste in others.
The same divergence of opinion is
also true of the British humor shows
compared with the American ones, per-
haps more so because taste in humor is
a more individual matter than in drama.
The greater the range offered, the better,
and if British drama displeases some, it
is sure to please others. At the very
least it provides a welcome change from
slickness, eagerness to please everyone
and offend no one, and the surface treat-
ment of contentious matters which
troubles some of us in American shows.

fpHREE films which have come equipped
with enviable overseas reputations
certainly have interest and entertainment,
but they left me with a sense of mild
wonder at all those screams of critical
rapture.
“David and Lisa”, the hit of Sydney’s
1963 Film Festival, was categorically
stated by “Time” to be “a minor master-
piece, easily the best US movie released
in 1962”. Well, it’s beautifully acted,
unobtrusively directed and photographed
and its heart is so clearly in the right
place that it’s difficult to be too critical
of it; but this does not add up to a
masterpiece, major or minor.
Based on a psychiatrist’s case-history,
this is the story of two emotionally dis-
turbed adolescents whose growing affec-
tion and trust lead them back to sanity.
There are some moving scenes, but the
suspiciously facile solution boils down to
the oversimplified, sentimental axiom
“Love conquers all”. The youngsters’
problem is the fashionable one of lack
of communication, particularly with their
elders, but once they’ve started to com-
municate with each other, complete re-
covery is just around the corner.
The acting is the film’s saving grace;
Keir Duilea s performance is a delicately
balanced combination of emotion and
intelligence, and Janet Margolin seems
to have an instinctive, intuitive feeling for
the character of the schizophrenic girl.
A controlled, professional piece of acting
from Howard da Silva as the psychia-
trist by the way, he never seems to
bother treating his ether patients keeps
down the film’s tendency to overstate-
ment.

communication between the generations
in “The Knack”, too, but here it causes
no psychological problems. Who wants
to communicate with old people anyway?
As far as “The Knack” is concerned,
senility sets in when a person turns 25, if
not sooner.
The film is about three young London-
ers, one spectacularly endowed with the
knack of getting off with girls, another
who longs to acquire the knack, and a
third who, in the intervals of painting
his apartment white, observes and com-
ments upon them indulgently the cata-
lyst of the situation being a provincial
maiden who has strayed into the big city
with the evident intention of being
attacked by men.
This shred of a plot is merely a basis
for Richard Lester’s directorial arab-
esques. Ann Jellicoe's play naturally relied
on verbal humor, and Lester has rightly
enough translated it to the screen in
cinematic style as a predominantly visual
exercise. But he’s unfortunately obsessed
with the modish gimmicks action
speeded, slowed or frozen, jump cutting,
odd camera angles— and is always too
willing to miss a point or prolong a scene
to indulge in these tricks. “The Knack”
certainly has its moments, and Michael
Crawford gives a very engaging per-
formance; but this struck me as a film
that wasn’t nearly as funny as it thought
it was.
“Cat Ballou” is becoming the subject
of a cult among overseas movie buffs,
apparently because it dares to poke fun
at the Western mystique; but this was
done years ago in “Ticket to Tomahawk”
and “Walter Mitty” and probably long
before that. Don’t, therefore, expect a
pearl of satirical wit, but “Cat Ballou”
is still a good deal of fun, and is enriched
by a brilliant dual performance by Lee
Marvin as a deadly killer whose appear-
ances are accompanied by rattlesnake
music and as a superannuated gunfighter
so whisky-sodden that he can barely
clamber on to his horse, much less stay
on it.

Indestructible
Marlene Dietrich. Princess Theatre. Mel-
bourne.
Ohe is still la grande vedette . . . time
has not touched her. The eyes and
the face still convey innocence, haughti-
ness and sadness: the voice has not lost
its elusive seductiveness and even the
body remains beautiful. Her legs? She
does not have to show them they are
hidden under the sheer sequin dress which
appears when the famous swansdown
coat is shed. There she stands, straight,
tall and supple, as fresh as on the day,
half a lifetime ago, when she faced Emil
Jannings and Josef von Sternberg. What
makes her so moving is her spirit and the
way it seems to defy the dark powers of
the age. A few songs, a toss of the head,
some gestures: by themselves, nothing,
but this is Marlene Dietrich.
Not long ago I saw her on television,
in an international cabaret programme
from Germany. She sang “Where Have
All the Flowers Gone?” A song against
war, and when the fat Dusseldorf patrons
clamored for an encore she apologised
and swept them with an unforgettable
look of contempt, hardly concealed. They
hate her over there, and perhaps that’s
one of the reasons why the rest of the
world likes her. She is an artist, her
artistry lies in her person, and her person-
ality symbolises something indestructible.
It is the same with Chevalier and it was
the same with Josephine Baker and Edith
Piaf. The charisma of these people can-
not be explained simply by taking to
pieces what they do on stage.
Many of her songs are quite undis-
tinguished, especially the ones that were
written for her in America. She treats
them, as she treats herself, with a cer-
tain irony as she runs through her
repertoire in a chanson autobiography of
her career, ending rather than beginning
with “Falling In Love Again”, from “The
Blue Angel”. It is amazing what she can*
do with indifferent pieces never meant tfij
be sung in a large theatre, but she doesj
better with the more worthwhile ones,
like “Go Away From My Window”!
“Marie, Marie”, “Lili Marlene”, “Lola’’
and “Peter, Wenn du Geburtstag Hast”,;
She is a German and she still sings like
one. I
But her greatest number now is “Where,
Have All the Flowers Gone?”, which she;
renders with tremendous and controlled
intensity. Of course, she is not a folk
singer, but she can take a folk song and
imbue it with the eroticism of the night-
club, just as she can take a nightclub
song and, humanising it, elevate it out of;
its class.
Essentially she is an actress . . . ai
dramatic actress who sings. The voice has
its unique quality but nobody would call)
her exceptionally musical. She works
with a microphone. She handles her vocal'
chords as an actress would to get her
effects, even the cracks and cackles are
calculated to a nuance. She knows how
to stand still while giving the illusion of
movement, relying on a lift of the eye-
brows, a sudden, provocative sweep of
the arms. Alone among the illustrious
sex symbols she does not exude fleshli-
ness, nor yet femininity in the accepted
sense. She started as a vamp but nowa-
days she is more than that. I would call
what she has a lyrical paganism, and she
arouses some of the emotions one experi-
ences when seeing a fine actress doing
Candida. That she is a superb show-
woman goes without saying. Everything,
down to the manner of her bowing to
applause, is part of an act in which each
detail serves the whole. What is the
whole? A particular kind of loneliness,
borne without sentimentality, in which
the spectator dissolves his own isolation.
The ovation Melbourne gave her may
have been nostalgic but it was not for
the past. It was for the living artist. Her
performance lasts just over an hour and
is preceded by another hour or so of
mixed variety, which includes dancers,
"Stop hounding me, I'll tell you
when it's 1975!"

Confrontation
photo Finish. Peter Ustinov. Ensemble
Theatre. Sydney.
The Mandrake. Niccolo Machiavelli. De-
partment of Italian Drama Group. Union
Theatre, Sydney.
What would it be like to meet the
self one was ten, fifteen or twenty
years ago? Twentieth-century drama
has been much preoccupied with philo-
sophical questions about time and the
self. In “Photo Finish” there is a
quadruple confrontation of Sam Kinsale
by himself at four different ages—eighty,
sixty, forty and twenty. But Peter Ustinov
is no Pirandello and this looking-glass
situation is used merely as a novel way
of presenting a very familiar theme: that
love depends on illusion. At each age,
except the last, Sam Kinsale is obsessed
with a woman and at each later age,
.looking back, he thinks the earlier
obsessions were absurd.
Ustinov writes clever, sophisticated
dialogue which, together with the in-
geniously contrived plot, carries the play
along at a good pace with only inter-
mittent patches of tedium.
With the appearance of Sam’s Vic-
torian papa, a strutting peacock of a
man dashingly played by Kenneth Laird,
the play reveals a sudden possibility
of taking flight into goonery, with eighty-
year-old Sam resentfully shouting at his
sixty-year-old daddy. But, unfortunately,
Ustinov is determined not to let his play
soar into such realms but drags it back
,to earth to spell out his commonplace
insights to the last syllable.
Because the actors in this production
(by Hayes Gordon) are robbed, by the
intimacy of theatre-in-the-round, of the
usual aids to illusion which are so help-
ful in a play like this, they have to really
* act to make us believe in them. Not all
of them succeed. Max Cullen, with
sunken head and sagging jaw and an
old man’s mixture of chirpiness and
irritability, does carry conviction as Old
Sam and gives the production a strong
centre. Judith Fisher, with the difficult
task of playing Stella at all ages, does
best as the middle-aged woman, embit-
tered but still passionate. But she makes
the old lady a farcical cross between a
stage cleaning-woman and a creature
from one of Beckett's dustbins.
By contrast with the world - weary
cynicism of an overturned romanticism
at the Ensemble, Machiavelli’s comedy,
which ran for three nights only at the
Union, has a delightful freshness and
verve. It is worldly but not world-weary,
unillusioned but not disillusioned. It
celebrates, not condemns, life.
By an elaborate ruse the young and
beautiful Lucrezia, wife of the elderly
Messer Nicia, is persuaded to spend the
night with a supposed beggar who is in
fact the handsome young Callimaco. The
foolishness of her learned husband, the
simplicity of her mother and the venality
of her father-confessor combine to defeat
her virtue and common sense. But since
the outcome is so pleasant she cheer-
fully decides to make the best of it.
The colloquial liveliness of the Bentley-
May translation was well served by the
confident exuberance of that engaging
pair of plotters: Harry Leventhal as
Callimaco with his elaborate French
accent and Dick May as the parasite,
Ligurio. Frederick May, the producer,
played Timoteo, the villainous priest,
with great relish.

BOOKS
The Art of Vulgarity
By R. M. WILDING
Doings and Undoings. Norman Podhoretz.
Rupert Hart-Davis. 535.
Inhere is something sad about the
-*■ embalmed urgency of collected book
reviews. We leaf through old weeklies
or quarterlies but tend to skip the hurried
judgments on too many books that
huddle quietly at the back. Time and
fashion and paperbacks make their own
selections; and we are rarely inclined to
check our opinions on books we have
read with those earlier, immediate judg-
ments.
Norman Podhoretz has rescued 27
long reviews and literary essays he has
written in the past ten years. Perhaps
he was unwilling to lose them to their
natural fate. Certainly such a fate, he
believes, is an unjust one. In his review
of the “New York Review of Books” he
writes that “one of the distinguishing
marks of the literary intellectual is that
to him a book is as real an experience
as a raw event might be, and he therefore
addresses himself to it with all the in-
telligence, knowledge, passion, grace and
style he can command. And so it is
that some of the best writing done in
America over the past ten or fifteen
years, and some of the most illuminating
discussion of the life of our times, can
be found in the back files of magazines
like ‘Partisan Review’ and ‘Commentary’,
in the small print of the book reviews
Podhoretz’s enthusiasm cannot be dis-
missed merely by saying that he has an
interest in puffing the game —he has
written for “Partisan” and edits “Com-
mentary”. He seems really to believe in
the enduring worth of the review article,
and in his essay on “The Article as
Art” he argues that the article has taken
over from the novel as the major literary
form of our time. He offers an ingenious
analogy with architecture and design:
we prefer “functionalism”, we like
things that are “stripped down to essen-
tials, purged of all superfluous matter”.
I'm not sure, though, that Podhoretz
knows what the “function” of a novel,
or of literature ir. general, is. The fact of
his discussing it in functional terms
suggests that his conceptions of art are
somewhat narrow and somewhat set.
Certainly the article can deal directly
with immediate issues “the world out
there” as he calls his section of reviews
of books on non-literary topics. Yet even
if we accept his argument that the con-
temporary novel has shut out this world,
it does not follow that its concerns are
of less importance. Podhoretz offers a
further analogy of the poetry and novel
of Victorian England. Poetry declined
because it shut itself off from the world,
he assures us, so it is the novelists “who
had not yet quite achieved the status of
‘creative’ and ‘imaginative’ writers and
to whom the smell of vulgarity that had
once been associated with the novel still
clung—Dickens, George Eliot, Thacker-
ay, James—who represent their age most
vitally and powerfully”. Podhoretz does
not question that literature’s worth can
be indicated by the power of its rep-
resentation of its age. And his analogy,
too, is unconvincing; what taint of vul-
garity attached to George Eliot; whose
novels were the only novels that Herbert
NORMAN PODHORETZ
Spencer admitted to the non-fiction Lon-
don Library? And James —he was
afflicted by vulgarity no more than by
popularity.
But Podhoretz has a flag to fly. The
championing of the article is only a
natural consequence of those assumptions
he declares in his introduction.
“. . . Since I do not regard it (litera-
ture) as an end in itself, I have only very
rarely considered that it was enough in
discussing a book to pronounce judg-
ment on its artistic merits. The judg-
ment, of course, always has to be made:
without it, literary discourse is nothing,
it becomes pointless or merely sub-
servient to fashion, and it never acquires
an urgency or a grace of its own. Even
a wrong or stupid judgment is better
than none . .
The difference between “judgment”
and “fashion” Podhoretz never defines.
Yet what is fashion except a series of
individual judgments? To read the critics
of the past is to be reminded of how
literary judgments do succeed each other
as literary and critical fashions change,
And then Podhoretz argues that since'
for him literature is not an end in itself,
“my attitude toward it, in other words,
is agnostic rather than religious: I do
not go to literature for the salvation of
my soul, but only to enlarge or refinei
my understanding . . But to go to
literature as a sort of religion would nor
be to treat literature as an end in itself;
he seems to comprehend the attitude he)
attacks no more than he understands the
meaning of the word “agnostic”.
The attitudes he supports, though, he;
knows clearly enough. “For such a critic,'
the question is what the strengths or
weaknesses of the book under considera-i
tion mean. He wants to know what they'
suggest about the possibilities of life in
his time.”
This seems to me to be terribly close,;
indeed, to using literature as a religion, 1
as offering ways of life and seems also'
to suggest an evaluation of literature in
non-literary terms. It is an evaluation,
certainly, that deals only with part of
the experience of literature. “Whatever
you may say about this as an approach
to literature in general,” he says—though
he rushes on clearly unconcerned with
whatever we may want to say—“it is, I
am convinced, the only approach a
serious critic can take if he is to devote
his attention to new writing at all use-
fully”.
Whatever you may say about Mr
Podhoretz’s approach, it is, I am con-
vinced, likely that a critic who claims his
to be the “only approach” is misguided.
One of the things that we can say about
literature is that it demonstrates the|
naivety of a belief in one answer, onej
approach, one criticism, one way of life.
Podhoretz’s commitment to commitment
would be more appealing were it held less
dogmatically, would be more appealing
if there were any suggestions that he
responded to some others of the various
qualities and appeals of literature.
Some of his more interesting reviews
are, indeed, on non-literary topics —on
the Irish potato famine, on Hitler and
the Jews, on Truman. This is not to
dismiss the literary section. The shorter
reviews of “Another Country”, “Catch
22”, Mailer and Updike and so on —do
not gain by ageing. But the summarising
pieces of Edmund Wilson, Scott Fitz-
gerald, Nathanael West are very read-
able, polemical introductions.
And to be fair to Podhoretz, his literary
theory is not obtrusive throughout the
book. What is more worrying is the
necessary superficiality the quick run
through in “the New Nihilism and the
Novel” is an extreme example of this.
And concomitant is the crudity of
generalisation that perhaps the article
(and this is one reason that I suspect it
is not Art) invites. He claims that the


trouble with Scott Fitzgerald was that
be was incapable, except at rare moments,
“of the profound self-awareness that
more than anything else marks the
really great writer, the writer of genius”.
« Yet where would you point to “self-
awareness” in Shakespeare or in Donne
or James? Could we ever say that they
were or were not self-aware? Even less
tenable is the assertion that “a writer
who is being as straight with himself
as he can possibly be will always write
with assurance, authority and economy”.
It makes it all so easy. He writes on tele-
vision drama that something like the
Oedipus complex is “taken for granted”
in a TV play “it isn’t a mysterious,
sinister force (as it tends to be in the
movies) . . But the sweep of his
generic definition is matched in the same
essay when he writes of “the values and
aspirations of the newly emerged middle
class”. Hasn’t every literary critic-turned-
sociologist had the middle class rising
from the time of Chaucer onwards? But
this sort of unthought popular sociology,
together with the easy assertion and the
occasional inaccuracy (Aeneas was never
“thought” to be founder of Britain,
though in a literary myth his great-grand-
son Brutus was) and the uncomplicated
evaluating scheme for literature, slip
easily through the reticulations of Mr
Podhoretz’s not over-fine mind.

Murray-Smith. The Jacaranda Press.

fPHE quality of Australian literary life
A has been largely decided and will
continue to be decided for some time by
the nature of the little magazines, reviews
and literary journals which support it.
Until recently no major Australian news-
paper was prepared to pay more than a
gesture fee for poems; the best, the most
sustained criticism written here, appears
in privately supported university jour-
nals. If the established magazines have
encouraged the work of young and
developing writers, the more established
writers have always generously supported
young and developing magazines. Aus-
tralia is still a country where it is almost
impossible for anyone to set up as a fully
professional writer without a private
income or a string of pot-boilers behind
him. Certain kinds of professionalism
and literary careerism are full of obvious
dangers for the creative writer; so too is
constant amateurism, a literary life on
the level of the parish paper.
Over the last 20 years “Meanjin” has
been the outstanding literary journal in
this country the best produced, the
widest-ranging in sympathies and taste,
the most varied in its output. But Aus-
tralia has long grown beyond the stage
where one major little magazine could
serve all its literary purposes; and the
last ten years in particular have seen
the proliferation of a number of journals
from “Westerly” to “Quadrant”, from
“Balcony” to “Prospect”, to mention
only a few of those which publish
original, creative work.
Indeed, one might now begin to feel
with some justification that we have
enough little journals for the time being.
There isn't that much free talent to go
round and one journal of concentrated
quality is worth half a dozen uneven
papers. Training fields are important;
but there needs to be some sense of an
arena.
“Overland” is one of the more recent
Australian journals. It was inaugurated
in 1954 as a forum for social-realist
writing; it has continued to bear the
epigraph “Temper Democratic, bias Aus-
tralian”. It has undergone many vicis-
situdes since its beginnings the most
notable being those involved with Mr
Murray-Smith’s leaving the Communist
Party in 1958. It has improved in
STEPHEN MURRAY-SMITH
format and content; literary quality has
assumed a greater role. It has made its
way to become one of the important
local literary papers.
In his preface to “An Overland
Muster”, Mr Murray-Smith tells us that
his criterion has not been literary quality
alone. “We have tried to give some sort
of expression to our feeling that literature
has become separated from life and that
we would like to see the focus adjusted
. . . From the time ‘Overland’ was
founded until the present day I have seen
as one of its most important functions
to make the voice of humanism, radical-
ism and social protest more effective
because broader, more humorous, more
conscious of literary standards and less
dogmatic in every way . . I.imagine
no one would want to quarrel with Mr
Murray-Smith’s professed desire to bring
art and life closer together; but in spite
of the defensiveness of his preface there
has never been, to my knowledge, a
mandarin literary establishment in Aus-
tralia; the “Overland” line has its place
in Australian writing; and while there
is always a danger of art losing effective
contact with life, it seems to me that
the real danger in literary life in Australia
is not that “Overland's” aim will be over-
looked, but that the values of art will
be constantly ignored. There is no likeli-
hood at all of aestheticism in one form
or another taking over here.
But principles and prefaces, pro-
nouncements and prognostications are
one thing; publications another. The
real test of an anthology as of a journal
is not its professed policies, but what it
prints —in the same way that a critic
is not to be judged finally by the right-
ness of his opinions and judgments as
much as by the way that he ratifies them
by his own style and approach.
“Overland” has published good
High Wind At Hokio
That day the gale blew hard, if
I remember rightly so
we left the cart by the bridge
and trod the rough grooved beach, deaf
with the air’s army that blew’
snakes of sand from the dune's edge
to fill our shoes. A low plain
of toitois opened her knees
on the tumbling brown-white flood
of waves like the chaos when
Earth was born . . . But what bound us
together and apart did
not slacken mother, father,
daughter, son held by the yoke
that rubs us raw yet teaches
a kind of truth: that nowhere
can the heart finally speak
or cease burning, as air touches
the dry sand and makes it flow,
or as that Maori girl rode out
on a sideways cantering
horse, from the bridge where a boy
chucked hollow reeds on the mute
creek, against the gale blowing.

material since its inception. A Patrick
White story; the Whitman-O’Dowd cor-
respondence that appeared in the autumn
1962 number: these have been its most
distinguished scoops. It has encouraged
the work of young and aspiring writers.
With some notable exceptions the best-
known Australian writers have con-
tributed to it. One imagines that like
any other Australian journal it took the
best that it could get; it has had its
very dry patches. For a magazine with
ostensibly so definite a platform it has
always been amiably inclusive.
Inclusiveness is perhaps the main
feature of “An Overland Muster” though
we are told that it aims at presenting us
with a selection of characteristic material
rather than a collection of the most per-
manently valuable items printed. It
ranges from examples of the work of
older writers like Dame Mary Gilmore
and Robert D. Fitzgerald to pieces by
Judith Green and .David Malouf. It is
part of any literary journal’s function to
honor those who have contributed to
the country’s cultural development, and
this anthology collects together a number
of obituaries and short tributes to
writers: Miles Franklin, Vance Palmer
and Ethel Turner are among those
remembered.
But if I may intrude a literary prefer-
ence at a point where they are usually
considered irrelevant, I would single out
Anne Chloe Elder’s remarkable “Strong
Man, Sad Pierrot” a memoir of
Edouard Borovansky, written with re-
markable vivacity and ease. Its publica-
tion is enough in itself to challenge any
simplified image of “Overland”, and I
hope Mrs Elder will one day write a full
length study of Borovansky’s contribution
to culture in Australia.
The selection of verse ranges from
pieces of almost anonymous light verse
through pieces of protest and moralising
to more personal and felt utterances.
Judith Wright’s beautiful “Nankeen
Night Herons” is here; so is Chris
Wallace - Crabbe’s fine translation of
Alberti’s “A Un Capitan de Navio” and
Noel Macainsh’s “A Contemporary
Novelist Upon the Plot of Himself”.
There is a good selection of some of Max
Harris’ recent poems and a wild, almost
beat poem by Geoffrey Dutton,
“Thoughts, Home from Abroad”, which
shows him moving in a realm between
decent indignation and exaggerated
comic protest that is becoming uniquely
his own. Certainly we have had too
little verse involving this level of social
comment.
Reviews, too, play an important role
in any literary journal and “An Over-
land Muster” reprints notices by lan
Turner of “Voss” and David Martin of
“Brennan’s Collected Verse”. Neither
was particularly worth preserving. But
Mr Murray-Smith has rightly included
a number of full-length critical articles
in his muster and of these, A. A. Philips’
“Barbara Baynton and the Dissidence
of the Nineties” is outstanding. Barbara
Baynton is one of the least well known
of Australian writers and Mr Philips’
essay should do much to revive interest
in an author who should never have
fallen into neglect. Remarkable, too, are
Vance Palmer’s superbly written short
introduction to A. G. Stephens and John
Thompson’s “Harney’s War”, his famous
long interview with Bill Harney. There
are notable stories by John Morrison
and David Martin.
I should like to have seen poems here
by Bruce Dawe, John Blight and David
Campbell: all have published in “Over-
land” and their work could only give
this collection added subtlety and depth.
But a journal which can accommodate
Hope’s “The Upsniff Tragedy” and lan
Mudie’s “Pelicans” is clearly offering as
much from the possible variety and
abundance of art as can reasonably be
expected. Whatever “Overland” rep-
resents as a journal, “An Over and
Muster” is to be judged as an anthology.
As a miscellaneous collection it contains
some of the most interesting things
written recently in Australia. One could
hardly hope for more.
Feebler Than the Truth
By M. H. ELLIS
Ghost Towns of Australia. George Farwell.
Rigby. 375. 6d.
IV/fR Farwell’s excursion into departed
history gives one the impression
that he has woken up some morning
imbued with determination to write a
travel book in record time and has done
it.
Whizzing through a large number of
promising prospects, in each of which
he has spent an hour or two in the local
hostelry with likely - looking Mun-
chausens, he has filled his notebooks
hurry-scurry with results that make one
more earnestly than ever deplore the
passing of the pioneers. Many of them,
poor old fellows, deserved a good laugh.
They would have had a good laugh at
some of Mr Farwell’s tales and concep-
tions.
Mr Farwell operated on a large variety
of towns Tallangatta and Clunes in
Victoria, Hill End and Silverton and
Milparinka, Innamincka, Cooktown, Port
Douglas, Burketown and Maytown,
Marble Bar and Borroloola. Many of
them were never towns at all, but merely
ephemeral camps or seasonal depots.
Others were only ghosts at any time.
Borroloola is a good example of the
unrealities of Mr Farwell’s tales. In its
modern degeneracy it may have become,
in the words of Mr Harney, whom its
inhabitants refused to take to their hearts
when he came in the 19205, a “combo’s
retreat” a town of whites living with
black gins. The all-powerful Sergeant
Scott, apart from the public opinion of
its old men, would have obviated that
disgrace in its older days.
It was a river-loading depot for stores
for the OT Line in the 1870 s; a depot
in the next decades where the teams
gathered from 500 miles around in
season to pick up their annual supplies
from the periodical steamer.
It had no streets or shops. In the old
days there was a pub living on hope
and a store which served in turn the
drovers, the Chinese prospectors who
“pocketed out” the Limmen River
banks, the nomads, the adjacent stations.
Its vast maidan remained empty for
most of the year, but when the boat was
due it was thick with camped teams,
with bullock teams, pony pack-teams,
even camel teams. At night fires blazed
over its surface, the air was full of song
and the music of mouth-organ and con-
certina. The rum ran red. And then the
boat came and the teams and the horse-
men faded away towards Tanumbirini
and the Four Archers, Walhallow and
Anthony’s, Robinson River and the
Headingly Track and Burketown where
some of them loaded up from another
boat after providoring wild Wollogorang.
They then moved out up the rivers
towards the Selwyns. Borroloola relapsed
into silence, leaving only the store and
the old-time sergeant with his proud but
naked chain gang, the crocodiles and
the few ancient all-male inhabitants.

ancientry is mainly of modernism. Roger
Jose, on whose picturesqueness he and
other breathless visitors set so much
store, and the post office were both
modern manifestations. As late as the
middle 1920 s the mail still came down,
via Tanumbirini, by packhorse every
six weeks along a track marked by a
disturbed ribbon of grass. And Mr Jose
certainly was not there in those days,
though Mr Farwell claims that he arrived
in 1916. The pioneers of the “earlies”
seemingly are forgotten.
How can the story of The Loo (as
Borroloola is locally known) be justly
told without due reference to Dangerous
Dan, or to Charles Scrutton, who had
been right-hand man to the Jardines on
their historic cattle-drive to Cape York
in 1865, and who died, the doyen of a
population which boasted that it averaged
more years than the proverbial three
score and ten, in 1928 and nudging 96?
What is Borroloola without the Lynott
brothers who blazed the Selwyn Track?
Mr Farwell has never heard of most
of these citizens and he knows just about
as much as he does about The Loo of
some other northern towns and their
personalities who were the very hearts
and dynamic of those towns. Croydon
he immortalises without a single reference
to the historic trek to save a government,
1500 miles from Croydon to Brisbane,
of Kuropatkin Murphy, MLA, from
whom no tale of Croydon’s glory can be
separated. Burketown appears as a mere
Nevil Shute-ish abstraction, with noth-
ing that gives the reader any idea of the
lusty, he-mannish trading port it was in
the pre-World War I years.
The only thing realistic about Mr Far-
well’s description of Burketown is his
essay on the effects of its rum on the
human physique.
In the years when the cradles and
pans still made their virile music on the
Kidston and Etheridge alluvial fields,
it was a beverage that varied in nature
and density as the level in the cask sank
and rose. Thirst competed sturdily with
additives such as cast-off Niggerhead
plug, orange skins, potato peelings and
bore water, until potability ceased in
losing conflict with the axiom: “If you
are strong enough to stir it, you can
still dare to drink it.”
Mr Farwell’s admission that he was
so artless as to be persuaded to indulge
in this local tipple excuses his credulity
in many matters.
But let it be said that Mr Farwell’s
fiction or near fiction is often much
feebler than the truth.
Absent Friend
Pass ihe bottle (there is only one way
round)
And send this too familiar context
Into strange particulars. Profound
Silences (each does his best to select).
Meaningless, because of the singular
Slap of the bottle in the one-way hand.
(Singular thoughts attempting the per-
pendicular
In the confined clarity of the ground
sand.)
Goodbye. Au revoir. It's my turn next.
It's running low. Time is a whole, and
the minute
Precisions are nothing but a pretext
For avoiding awareness of the limit.
Au revoir. Goodbye. The issue is too
complete.
The last of the bottle. The imperious
engines compel.
It is time. We have all been too proudly
discreet
To recall one whose absence is loudest
farewell.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Those Bad Debts Again
T>AD debts from retail credit groups in Australia keep mounting and Eric Anderson
•*“* (Consolidated) Limited, Sydney-based electrical retailer, reported last week that
it had written off £l.l million in the past four years.
The bad debts position in Australia
is rising to staggering proportions and
perhaps the significance is lost on what
this means to shareholders.
If bad debts in recent years have cost
£som., it means that shareholders’ funds
also have been lost. The penalty to share-
holders will go on for some years be-
cause of depleted working capital, lost
shareholders’ funds and the problems that
will arise from further bad debts cur-
rently considered doubtful.
Shareholders not only lose by way of
dividends but also through capital ero-
sion. If a shareholder is forced to sell
his shares on the market, he very often
suffers a severe market loss.
Is it any wonder he is hostile at the
situation which has developed? The re-
ward to shareholders for thrift and sav-
ing (and paying your debts) apparently
is a slap in the face from those people
who are keen to enjoy a high standard
of living but are unwilling or unable
to pay for it.
There must be a lesson here some-
where. In seeking where to apportion the
blame, shareholders are entitled to ask
about the credit systems employed by
the various firms which are handling
public money.
It is small consolation to hear that,
because of retail competition, traders are
forced to sell goods without a deposit
and avoid the legal protection of a hire
purchase contract which permits repos-
session. The argument against hire pur-
chase is that it requires a 10 p.c. de-
posit, the cost of stamp duty is pro-
hibitive and it is impractical to repossess
goods on a market saturated with domes-
tic appliances.
Credit controllers who screen term
credit sales may claim that all known
checks have been made on a customer’s
credit worthiness without uncovering the
unpleasant fact that the customer has in
fact diddled other companies out of
their money. Evidently there is no pro-
tection against skip-outs, those people
who flit from one address to another.
Also the publicity on bad debts has
helped certain types of people to realise
there are ways and means to avoid their
responsibilities. All the more reason for
the introduction of a central credit
bureau.
One thing is certain from these re-
sounding bad debts: the rush to sell
goods on commission, regardless of
credit risk, has now been discarded by
most firms.
Retailers are now reporting along the
lines of Eric Anderson that a more
selective credit policy, contraction of
stores and intense competition for the
custom of those people regarded as good
credit risks have caused a significant loss
in turnover and lower profit margins.
Again this suggests lean profits and a
longer wait for dividends. Shareholders
might be prepared to swallow this bitter
pill if they felt confident that losses had
been stopped. But bad debt write-offs
keep recurring.
Fresh Water from the Sea
T>erhaps the most significant industrial
research yet undertaken is the cur-
rent drive to obtain fresh water from the
world’s oceans.
Australia, as one of the driest contin-
ents in the world, should appreciate the
immense urgency prompted by the re-
cent international symposium on water
desalinisation launched in Washington,
headed up with a 200 million dollar
research programme by the US.
If the US and Mexico succeed in their
proposed plan to build a large nuclear-
powered desalinisation plant to serve
large arid areas of both countries, Aus-
tralia must benefit.
Water shortage is indeed serious
THE SHEIK OF KUWAIT
throughout the world and the economl
programmes of these countries must b
tied up with an increased supply of fres:
water. Most desalinisation processes si
far have been too expensive, particular!)
for outback areas.
Some hope is held for the new prot
cess developed by General Dynamics
USA, which has introduced a papers
thin, cellulose acetate membrane to filtef
up to 99 p.c. of salt from sea water. I
The trouble with all modern indus-
trial developments is that the desalinisa-j
tion process is needed in remote ani
arid areas where there is little justifica-
tion for setting up industrial plants, ll
is a grim fact that must be faced, hew
ever, and will require government sup-
port as well as industrial know-how
Delay in trying to solve this all-importani
problem could prove a tremendoit
economic disadvantage. The questio l
arises: Are we treating the matter wil!
sufficient urgency?
British and American Share Markets
the Sheik of Kuwait tried to do
with his sterling balances may per-
haps symbolise the strain which the
pound now appears to have overcome, at
least for some little while. Fearing the
pressure, Kuwait asked the UK Treasury
and the Bank of England for a guarantee
on its London funds. This was refused,
largely so as not to create any precedent.
The new atmosphere surrounding the
pound leaves the Sheik quite happy and
contemplating no immediate escape from
the sterling area.
It should be recalled that, next to Aus-
tralia, Kuwait is the biggest holder of
London balances, with around £stg2so
million.
All that preamble merely points up the
main strengthener of the London share
markets recently—the recovery in sterling
and, only this last week, the announce-
ment of September's gain in gold reserves.
These are enabling retention of a reason-
ably firm’position overall. Yet there are
still other not so pleasant factors about
to influence prices.
The next few weeks must surely dis-
close, among company results, more bite
from the credit squeeze. Also overhang-
ing the market at the present moment
is the Rhodesian independence battle.
Between those two imponderables, last
week's more cautious investors decided
to slow up somewhat. A measure of
profit-taking thus ensued among equities,
leaders tended to droop and the brighter
tone was tarnished. A widely hoped-for
cut in Bank Rate may soon come to the
aid of industrial issues.
Wall Street, on the other hand, con-
tinues to ride over its apparent hindrances
and the Dow Jones, at Friday's 938:32,
nudges a fresh peak. President Johnson's
operation produced a shade of market
nervousness, but there was certainly no
sign of panic selling. Volumes suffered
only because of the Pope's visit and a
Jewish holy day.
So New York has seen second-line
stocks, as well as the blue chips, make
a broadly fronted advance. Motors,
chemicals and electronics did well.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Some Faint Cracks in
Full Employment
Structural weakness in private sector?
OUR postwar economic experience doesn’t support the statement made last week by
Mr H. G. Ferrier, Federal President of the Associated Chambers of Manufac-
tures of Australia, that “a pause can become a collapse overnight” that is, if by
collapse he means the sudden drying-up of business and the emergence of large
numbers of unemployed.
Coupled with his fears on the balance
of payments (unaerlined later in the week
by news of a £6O million drop in re-
serves in the September quarter, includ-
ing £l9 million in the latest week), Mr
Ferrier’s statement looked calculated to
warn all and sundry of the possibility
that harder times may be around the
corner. The impression was not allayed
by his assurance that he was sure the
Government was watching the situation
closely.
Admittedly, as readers of this column
will be aware, some mildly unpropitious
portents have been creeping on to the
local economic scene in recent months.
As we said (8., Sept. 18, page 61), the
official view that the labor market
would remain tight had not been serious-
ly challenged, but there has been a gen-
eral awareness in business for some time
that the tide of confidence would be turn-
ing as credit dampening soaks deeper
and begins to affect order books and
jobs.
True, there are as yet few signs of
business crumbling. Normally, after a
prolonged stretch of credit stringency
such as we’ve experienced this year, one
would have expected a spate of casual-
ties among marginal firms. Thus far
these have been relatively rare, because
business by and large has succeeded by
extensions of trade credits and incentive
discounting and the like in its efforts to
make the limited credit supplies go round.
Demand has been sustained at high lev-
els, at least until recently. Generally
speaking, the shortage of credit rather
than the flow of orders has been caus-
ing most of the business headaches. The
question now more frequently posed is
whether the faltering of orders in some
industries is merely temporary.
The ANZ Bank has been among those
most alert to the colder climate. It has
been calling attention to the hesitancy in
production and the easier signs in the
tight labor market these last few months,
without saying, of course, that taken
together these signs represent anything
more than faint cracks in the dykes of
full employment.
As a matter of fact, on the latest
Department of Labor and Industry
showing, the number of persons register-
ed for employment is still falling. But,
on a seasonally adjusted basis, it is tend-
ing to level out slightly. So is the num-
ber of vacancies notified to the depart-
ment. Further, contra-seasonal falls in
employment have occurred in a number
of industries and a decline in overtime
has been well spread. Also, average
hours of overtime worked per person
working overtime and per employee have
declined, as has the weekly rate of place-
ments by the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service.
At a time when some easing of the
acute labor shortage is to be welcomed
on economic grounds, it would be as
well to be cautious in interpreting these
figures. It is just conceivable that, at
this stage, the economy will be the bet-
ter for a pause, if only for digestion
purposes on the way up the slope.
The arguments put forward by the
Government, that demand pressures
strain limited resources and that some
cutback in demand is necessary in the
private sector to free more resources for
defence, postulate something of a pause
in private business. If the premises are
right, then the freeing of workers, say,
from the motor and its ancillary indus-
tries to take their place in defence indus-
try will be just what the doctors (Wilson
and Coombs) might have ordered, had
they any part in bringing it about.
This is not to say people who’ve lost
their jobs in the automotive industries
will necessarily see their dismissals in
the light of national economic require-
ments, though it will help them to do so
if defence jobs are immediately at hand
for them to step into. To bring its de-
fence arguments home to them the Gov-
ernment had better be pretty certain it
is not simply crying wolf and actually
can provide the jobs.
On the grounds that the Government
had a good case on defence for squeez-
ing the private sector to free more re-
sources, I argued at the time of the Bud-
get that it might usefully have taken a
stro'nger defence line, not so much by
attempting to reduce private demand by
wery much more than it did in the Bud-
get to make way for defence, but rather
by substantially reducing its estimates
for non-defence spending. It would be
unrealistic to attribute much of the re-
cent easing of the labor market to the
direct impact of the Budget. Over the
full year the Budget is calculated to have
a less buoyant effect on the economy than
the previous one, but depressant effects
are likely to be more evident in the sec-
ond half of the year than in the first
half.
Thus it could well be that the easier
labor position signifies that structural
weaknesses are emerging in the private
sector of the economy and hold a big-
ger potential threat to the level of em-
ployment than is superficially evident.

Headmaster,
Such weaknesses would include a grow-
ing surplus of plant and equipment, at
any rate in some industries if not over-
all, in relation to demand, which in the
case of many products is nearing satura-
tion point, or seems to be, for the cur-
rent trade cycle. Perhaps the automotive
industries provide the best examples of
these weaknesses, which it would not be
at all surprising to find after three years
of rapidly increasing fixed investment.
Even steel also seems to be infected to
some extent and the same may be said
for aluminium, chemicals, plastics, farm
machinery, and most consumer
durables.
If this is the right reading and, as I
suspect, the Government has not suf-
ficient defence production in mind to
take up any great volume of labor which
might be displaced from non-defence
industry, it will be interesting to see if
the position can be rectified simply by
reversing the official squeeze on demand
and by liberalising credit. It will be re-
membered that, in his talk to the Con-
gress on Human Relations earlier this
year, Mr McMahon pronounced that he
had absolute faith in the Government’s
ability to manipulate effective demand
to sustain full employment.
This faith was reflected in the Govern-
ment’s disavowal of the general thesis
of the Vernon Report, w'hieh envisaged
w'hat was not very aptly described by
critics as a siege approach to the econ-
omy in the next few years. My own
view is that, taking cognisance of struc-
tural weaknesses, Mr McMahon ma|
well have to temper his enthusiasm foj
demand and credit liberalisation, unlesi
he is prepared in some possible circum-
stances to tolerate a degree of inflatign,
not to speak of running the risk of hav-
ing a serious balance-of-payments crisis
on his hands.
With the continued erosion of over-1
seas reserves we are daily getting close!
to the point where demand and creditf 1
policies will have to be governed increasi
ingly by the balance of payments, as they
were, say, following November, I 960;
We have still a useful margin of time
but the realisation that it is not
may well explain some of the fire Mr
Holt has been nreathing into his recent
addresses ir. the United States on th«j
subject of worlc liquidity.
Even if the monetary authorities hav;
for some time been gearing their actions
to diminishing liquidity arising largelf
from the erosion of overseas reserves
the Treasury has not. Apart from the
mild mopping up through increases iij
tax rates in the last two Budgets, the
Treasury has, through its massive in-
creases in expenditure, been careless olj
eventual balance-of-payments possibili-j
ties. In the unhappy event of reserved
running down to danger point, it will ba
interesting to see whether Mr McMahon’f
theories on effective demand will carr)|
the Cabinet counsels or whether the Gov-
ernment will take fright as it did in(
1960 and squeeze both demand and 1
credit in the efforts to stave off a
balance-of-payments crisis.

Housing Off the Hook
That is, finance permitting
A S the possibilities are basically governed by the trend of savings bank deposits, if
would always be a bit presumptuous of the Reserve Bank to give any firi#
guarantees on behalf of the savings banks that the latter's housing loans will be kept
up to any particular level. For the same reason, it would be presumptuous for eitha
to give the Treasurer any guarantees on what the savings banks will put into Govern
ment bonds this year.
Several questions arise from last week’s
statement on housing loans by Mr J. G.
Phillips, deputy governor of the Reserve
Bank. One is whether it signifies a change
of policy on the part of the Bank towards
the volume of savings bank housing
loans.
Another is what are the grounds for
the savings banks’ confidence in their
being able to maintain the recent level of
these loans in face of the possibilities
that the lower growth rate in savings
banks deposits will continue. A third
question, with much wider economic im-
plications, is what in fact are the possi-
bilities ahead for savings deposits.
It is highly unlikely that, in making his
homilies on housing at this juncture, Mr
Phillips was merely playing post-box for
the savings banks. The political message
must have got through to Martin Place-
to make some sort of gesture to allay^
disquietened thoughts that housing had
lost its head of steam, which the Reserve
Bank has been watching closely these
last eighteen months or so lest it blew
its top.
From all the portents, the case f^
Reserve Bank caution on housing would
seem to have lost much of its point. Sc
the occasion was not inappropriate for i
to give at least some oblique, second
hand guarantees that, finance permitting
the reins might well be loosened. Thi
was probably a satisfying role for thr
Bank in that, instead of having to stead'
the pace of house lending by adjuring-
the savings banks to go slower on lenditi;

fas it has done at its regular meetings
with them over the last year or more),
the sanctions for going slower were now
firmly in the parlors of the banks them-
selves. One would imagine that, even if
Mr Phillips did not say so, the Reserve
Bank would turn its blind eye at this
juncture if savings banks deposits bucked
up a bit and let housing loans off the
hook.
However, as i. is still concerned to keep
the credit hatches battened down as a
counterweight to the Government’s ex-
pansive spending and internally to equate
the persistent and rising drain on over-
seas reserves, the Reserve Bank was ob-
viously not prepared to give a full-steam-
ahead signal for housing, whatever the
political overtones of threats to full em-
ployment and the urgencies of stepping
up housing to accommodate the expand-
ing numbers of immigrants.
Instead, it has put the ball at the feet
of the savings banks themselves to do
what housing lending they can within
their reduced deposits circumstances,
which have already forced them to cut
back fairly sharply. A spokesman of the
banks has explained that, on present de-
posit trends, their house lending looks
like being limited to an annual rate of
£l4O-£145 million, which would be from
£9-£l5 million lower than the range of
their actual loan approvals in the last
two years. In the latest June quarter, ap-
provals totalled £35.2 million or just
about the spokesman’s envisaged annual
rate, the lowest since the March quarter
of 1962 (at the end of the June quarter,
at £42.3 million, undrawn loan commit-
ments were also the lowest since the
March quarter 1962).
If the envisaged steadying of the down-
ward trend of approvals at the June
quarter level may seem only fractionally
lower than recent peaks, it has to be
remembered that the savings banks now
provide the bulk of private finance for
housing loans.
The life offices now put much less into
housing loans than they used to. In the
year to June, 1965, they lent only a few
thousands to building societies and their
house mortgage loan assets increased by
only £7i million to £169.2 million. This
compared with an increase in savings
banks housing advance assets of £93.9
million to £592.6 million over the same
period (at the end of August they had
further increased to £604.3 million).
Again, although in the last two years
the trading banks have been swelling
their fixed deposits at a great rate (by
£l7O million to £892.3 million in 1964-
65), partly with funds which, given a
less biased interest rate differential, would
have gone into savings banks deposits,
they increased their outstanding housing
loans by a mere £4 million to £109.6
million in the year to July last.
The confidence underlying savings
banks’ assurances that housing loans can
be held at something above £l4O million
a year doesn’t necessarily spring from any
conviction that their deposits are going to
increase at a much more rapid rate than
they have achieved so far this year.
Doubtless it is partly based on the scope
available to the banks in their assets and
flow of funds structures to keep housing
loans topped up.
Obviously, with the actual percentage
of total assets in housing loans well below
the allowable 35 per cent maximum, the
savings banks have a big margin to play
with in keeping up their housing loans.
This was well illustrated by their opera-
tions last y ear > when the net increase in
savings banks deposits was £205.1 mil-
|i° n ’ y e * th e ' r outstanding housing loans
increased by £93.7 million that is,
taking the equivalent of about 45 per

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Vernon and the Farmers
The position of rural credit
TTOW many people have read the Vernon Report and, now that it has been criticised,
* how many will bother to read it? The question is asked quite seriously because,
as far as the man on the land goes, it seems to this writer that the report does raise
some interesting points.
This does not mean that the report is
necessarily sound in all departments, or
that the critics are necessarily wrong in
all the things they say about it. But
rural credit is one particular point raised
in the report which does need urgent
attention. So far, excluding the observa-
tions of a handful of agricultural writers
and academics, the lack of long-term
rural credit has received scant attention.
The Government obviously feels that
there is no great problem. There is
no problem if you already have a
decent sort of a property or if you are a
big city businessman with a “tax prob-
lem”. If you are trying to buy a pro-
perty, however, or if you are trying to
develop one on initiative and enterprise
with minimum financial backing, the
situation is grim indeed.
The Government could justifiably
point to a myriad of financial benefits
accorded the primary producer, ranging
from taxation deductions to the super-
phosphate bounty and the various forms
of subsidy and semi-subsidy. Again, these
things are great and if you already
have a property or if you have tons of
money.
The present situation (developing for
some years now) is such, in this writer’s
opinion, that in another ten years the
Australian countryside will have changed
beyond recognition. There will be a
“vacating and consolidation” of proper-
ties; there will be enormous factory
farms controlled by boards of directors;
there will be pastoral monopolies as big
as, or bigger than, those which existed in
the 1880 s.
Perhaps this is what people want? If
so, then there is no point in suggesting
that the Government might be wrong.
Yet this writer believes there is just as
much desire on the part of young Aus-
tralians to go into farming. The pioneer-
ing spirit is not dead.
The younger generation today is little
different to any in the past. The outward
manifestations of teenage “degeneracy”
rock and roll, the long hair, etc.
can be largely attributed to the fact that
the arteries of our way of life have
hardened to such an extent that working
for somebody else is the best most kids
can hope for. On top of that, education
is better, physique and health are better,
and the welfare state has removed that
element of desperation which was com-
mon in earlier generations.
Perhaps today’s kids are too well man-
nered for their own good. Instead of
working off their frustration in “odd”
behavior and clothes, perhaps they
should be marching and picketing.
Statistics are readily enough available.
The Land Settlement Commission in Vic-
toria, which took over from the Soldier
Settlement Commission a few years ago,
has a waiting list of more than 3000 for
farms which most of them will never
get. Much the same situation applies in
all States. For the person of limited
capital, this is about the only way there
is of getting a property.
Yet there is no shortage of land. There
are properties put up for sale by the
dozen every week. They are bought, in-
variably, by other well-established farm-
ers or city businessmen. The price, which
the sellers are entitled to get, is too high
for the would-be farmer with limited
capital and too high even for the land
settlement commissions. As “odd-lo.s”
they are, in any case, not a practical buy
for a land settlement commission. The
price is an inflated price always, due, not
entirely but largely, to the Government
benefits extended to farming.
Now the Vernon Report does at least
touch on this problem. Clearly the Ver-
non Report does not reflect Government
thinking, but the Government did set it
up. One agrees wholeheartedly with the
comment by the president of the Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council, Mr T.
B. C. Walker.
Mr Walker said: “Apparently the
Government does not welcome the idea
of some new form of continuing consul-
tations between Canberra and industry
and commerce. What alternative has it
got towards ensuring a better mutual
appreciation of economic policy? In
general it could be said that Canberra
is remote from the community this
certainly applies in the field of economic
policy. If the Government will not accept
the Vernon Committee’s ideas for closer
links, what alternative has it got to
ensure that, as the influence of the
Federal Government spreads, it will not
become increasingly remote from indus-
try and commerce?”
Actually this writer would be surprised
if Mr Walker, or the Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council, share the general view
on rural finance put forward in this
article. That is neither here nor there.
The question Mr Walker asks is a good
one. The problem needs to be aired and
needs to be discussed intelligently. The
Government cannot avoid this by de-
claring that land settlement is a State
problem.
State and Federal efforts are too much

intertwined for that answer to be accept-
able. An example: the Federal Govern-
ment does not make funds available for
the NSW Coleambally closer settlement
programme, but it built the Snowy pro-
ject which makes Coleambally feasible.
There are many other examples.
The Vernon Report says, rightly, that
there is a need for more, and better,
research, extension and advisory ser-
vices generally. If the present trend con-
tinues, most of these things are going to
be paid for by urban taxpayers and, in
time, these taxpayers will begin to ask
why they should pay a farthing to help
huge landowners, farm monopolies and
a section of the community which, gener-
ally speaking, is a lot better off than
themselves.
The defence which would be put up
against making easy credit available is
that it might tend to encourage “peasant"
farmers with neither the will nor the
brains to keep out of difficulties. It is
a reasonable defence. Australia, for-
tunately, has avoided a “peasant” farm-
ing structure.
It need not go that far. There must be
a balance somewhere. There seems some-
thing crazy going on when only the very
old and the very wealthy have enough
money to become farmers.
The Vernon Report gets full marks
for the suggestion that research should
be undertaken into devising improved
forms of stabilisation support which “do
not impart a rigidity to land use or a
conservatism to farm management". One
might add that there should be research
into the way in which stabilisation sup-
ports invite circumvention by vertical
integrators, who do not really undercut
the true price but who prosper because
they can undercut an artificially created
price designed, originally, to keep fami-
lies on the land We have not encoun-
tered the full impact of this phenomenon
in Australia yet. but we will.
Incidentally, the Vernon Report men-
tioned that some 26 p.c. of some 308,000!
primary producers (not many, is it?) had*
incomes of less than £7OO in 1960-61,;
Presumably it could not find more up-to-
date figures. One feels that the picture!
has changed rather dramatically since!
1960-61. I
A good proportion of this poverty-i
farmer class would have been chicken*
farmers who have gone out of business!
in the last three years. To a lesser extent,
it would also have included potato farm-j
ers and vegetable growers. Chickens,
potatoes and vegetables have seen, and;
will see, continued vertical integration,!
True, there would be some wheat-
sheep farmers in this category still. But
it would be found that most of them
have always combined their farming witty
some other pursuit, e.g., fencing, con-!
tracting, dam-sinking, logging, stock-;
transporting and so on.
The Vernon Report is not nearly as!
adequate on farming matters as it could
have been. And this too, is not the point.
The point is that these things need to
be looked at by the Government, and its
public service advisers, and this is what
is not happening.
Inevitably the Vernon Report, be-
cause it is a loser, will be seized upon
by everyone with an axe to grind and
this most-unread of documents will be-
come a most frequently quoted docu-
ment. It would be surprising if the oppo-
nents of wheat stabilisation did not take
up the attack once again, quoting the
Vernon Report as support for their argu-
ment (it is and it is not). It does tend
to have an all-things-for-all-men quality
(like the IWTO letter on the reserve
price plan), yet that is not so terrible
really. What one would like to see is an
awareness, at least on the part of
the Government and the Canberra plan-
ners, that some of the matters raised in
the report warrant attention.
And as Mr Walker says, what are the
alternatives?
AGRISEARCH
Guarding Soil Fertility
Intensive sheep grazing leads to serious
loss of soil fertility. The sheep trans-
fer large quantities of soil nutrients from
the paddock to their camp sites. Here
they are lost or wasted. A proportion of
them sinks into the subsoil below the
root zone. Some more escapes into the
atmosphere. Another part, that which is
deposited near the centre of the camp,
is not used even while it remains in the
upper layer of soil, because plants do
not get an opportunity to grow in this
area. And a fourth fraction is expended
merely to support inedible weeds or to
promote rank pasturage which is rarely
eaten.
The main nutrients involved in the
transfer are nitrogen, potassium, and
phosphorus. However, the phosphorus
supply is maintained by the regular top-
dressing of the paddock with superphos-
phate. But the level of the other two
nutrients could fall steadily and begin
to limit plant growth. Indeed, in a typi-
cal instance, plant growth increased by
100 p.c. in response to the application of
potassium fertiliser and by 600 p.c. after
artificial nitrogen was provided.
Part of the potassium and nitrogen re-
moved from the grazed area of a pad-
dock goes, of course, in the wool and
meat sold. Yet it may be calculated that

these products contain only a quarter to
an eighth as much potassium as is trans-
ferred to a camp site. Unless some way
is found by which the sheep’s droppings
are uniformly distributed, the time is
approaching when the application of
potassium fertiliser to sheep farms will
have to become a regular practice. Even
the native-pasture properties may, in the
end, be forced to resort to this costly
solution. Under these pastures the soil’s
total supply of plant nutrients is often
very slender and so there is a delicate
balance between adequacy and defici-
ency. The slow, but persistent, removal
of potassium from the broad acres to
the vicinity of permanent camps could
sooner or later upset this balance. When
viewed from the air the sheep camps al-
ready stand out as a prominent feature
of the landscape in native-pasture areas.
The measurements and observations
provoking this gloomy prospect were
made on “Chiswick”, near Armidale, on
the Northern Tablelands of New South
Wales. The pastures were highly im-
proved and had carried up to eight
Merino sheep per acre for six years. The
paddocks were mainly quite small, but
one was as large as 50 acres and the
situation found to be prevailing in it was
not significantly different to what was
happening in the smaller paddocks. The
camps amounted to only 3 p.c. of the
total area but contained 22 p.c. of the
dung. In other words, the concentration
of droppings in and about the camp was
10 to 15 times greater than the average
over the rest of the paddock.
It is important to note that Merino
sheep were involved. In overseas studies
on the effect of intensive grazing on soil
nutrients it has been shown frequently
that a pasture benefits from the continu-
ous recycling of the nutrients from the
soil through the plant and animal and
back to the soil. However, dairy cattle
or British breeds of sheep were the ani-
mals used in these studies. Moreover,
they were not kept on the test plots for
long periods. Under these conditions
their excreta was probably distributed
fairly uniformly.
Pig's Whey
is a by-product of cheese and
" casein manufacture. Larger quanti-
ties are appearing as the amount of
cheese and, especially, casein being made
has been rising rapidly lately. Some fac-
tories manage to persuade nearby pig
farmers to take some as wet whey. Other
factories turn it into dry whey for calf
and poultry feed, but much whey re-
mains as a disposal problem for the
factories. Some have had to install
elaborate and costly plant merely to
convert it into a suitable form for dis-
charge as harmless effluent. Pig pro-
ducers could utilise more of it if there
weren’t certain problems associated with
feeding whey to pigs.
Research on whey feeding has been
carried out by Mr Dunkin, a lecturer in
pig husbandry at Massey University, New
Zealand, and he has made some dis-
coveries that should be of interest to
Australian pig farmers. The main prob-
lems met with in whey feeding are poor
growth, scouring, and general lack of
thrift. The slow growth rate has been
attributed to the low protein content of
whey. The New Zealand work has shown,
however, that it is rather the excessive
bulk of the whey which limits growth.
The pigs, particularly while they are
young, are simply unable to eat enough
to satisfy growth requirements.
Thus, when pigs were given unre-
stricted quantities of a concentrated whey
containing 30 p.c. dry matter, they con-
sumed 20 p.c. more dry matter and grew
10 p.c. faster than comparable pigs given
normal whey which contained 6 p.c. dry
matter. Another experiment also proved
that bulkiness rather than lack of pro-
tein is the main difficulty. In this ex-
periment the pigs grew just as rapidly
on a diet of cheese whey supplemented
with lib of barley meal a day as when
the barley meal was replaced with an
equal weight of meat meal a protein-
rich and relatively costly concentrate.
Also, it was shown that there is no need
to supply roughage. Lucerne chaff given
to whey-fed pigs did overcome the laxa-
tive effect, but did not improve the
growth rate. It would appear, therefore,
that if whey was partially concentrated
and a small cereal meal was added to
this diet pigs could be raised quite suc-
cessfully and probably relatively cheaply.

World’s Hungriest People
Yet Indians and Pakistanis fight
By E. J. DONATH
TT is almost impossible for an Australian
*■ to imagine having to live on 12
ounces of rice or wheat per day. This
is the ration for Delhi, Bombay, Cal-
cutta, Madras, Bangalore and all other
Indian cities which have a population of
more than a million people.
The Indian Government intends to im-
pose very soon the same ration on all
towns with a population of over 300,000.
Last week the Indian Congress working
committee called on the Government “to
tackle the nation’s food problem on a
war footing”. Since 1961-62 grain pro-
duction in India has increased by nearly
7 per cent. However, market arrivals
of major food grains have declined by
about one-third in the last three years.
The 600 million Indians and Pakis-
tanis are most likely the worst-fed people
of the world’s 3300 million. Yet they
devote their energy to killing each other
instead of trying to grow enough food
for their fast-increasing hungry millions.
General conditions in Pakistan can be
realised by its infant mortality rate of
55 per thousand one of the highest
in the world. Australia’s infant mortality
rate is well below 20 per thousand. Main-
ly due to malnutrition, about seven per
cent of Pakistanis suffer ffom pulmonary
tuberculosis
India’s food situation has deteriorated
in the 19605. Despite greatly increased
imports (mainly wheat) gross avail-
ability of food grains (rice, wheat,
maize, millet and other cereals) declined
from 18.9 ounces per head per day in
1960-61 to 17.2 in 1963-64,
Imports of wheat (mainly from the
United States under Public Law 480
foreign aid programme) amounted to
three million tens in 1961 and is ex-
pected to reach seven million tons in this
year. Total food grains production in
India amounted to 80 million tons in
1960-61 and is expected to exceed 90
million tons in 1965-66. About forty per
cent of this is rice, which has been stead-
ily increasing in production; the same
cannot be said about wheat, the output
of which has been rather stationary over
the last decade. Wheat comprises about
15 per cent of total food grains pro-
duction.
The production target for wheat for
the end of the first five-year plan was
8.3 million tons and for 1965-66 (end
of the third five-year plan) it is 15 mil-
lion tons. The production target for the
end of the fourth plan is 20 million tons
of wheat, out of a target of 120 million
tons of total food grains.
These production targets show clearly
the future needs. But there is no likeli-
hood that they will be reached, especi-
ally the target for wheat. Imports of
cereals (including rice) amounted to 3.2
million tons in 1959, increased to 6.2
million tons in 1964, and might reach
a record of 8 million tons in 1965.
I wonder how large food imports into
India will have to be in the coming years
a question which should be of con-
siderable importance to our farmers and
the Commonwealth Government.
The quickest way to stop the tragic
fight between India and Pakistan would
be the cessation of American food sup-
plies. India, especially, could not carry
on for very long without the tremendous
wheat gifts from the United States.


(AUSTRALIA) LIMITED
ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN
Eleventh Annual General Meeting, 1965
Although this is our Eleventh Annual Meeting, it is
dealing with our ninth full year of operations. It
seemed appropriate to me that we should now remind
ourselves of what has been achieved in that relatively
short time.
The Company was formed in 1955, as an equal
partnership between Rothmans (London) and the
Australian public, with Australian control of manage-
ment and policy. That has always been the position,
and it has been a significant part of the Company’s
success that its decisions are made in Australia by
Australians, without any direction of any kind from
overseas.
The initial capital was £750,000, of which over
£450,000 was lost in the first two years of establish-
ment. But the long-term concept was sound, as is
shown in these significant facts:
• The present paid-up capital of over £4,500,000 is
now supplemented by over £4,500,000 in reserves and
undivided profits, a total of more than £9,000,000
invested in the business.
• The Company is now the largest cigarette manufac-
turer in Australia, and is pre-eminent in the quality
market. Rothmans King Size Filter and Peter Stuy-
vesant are the biggest selling brands in their individual
price groups, and easily the two biggest sellers on the
market as a whole, while Rothmans King Size Plain is
the leader among the plain cigarettes. No competitor
has brand strength approaching this. It is important
to recognise that the quality market accounts for
more than 70% of all cigarettes sold.
Research, reflected through product quality, is
the basic reason for this leadership. The strictest
standards of quality control are enforced at every
stage of manufacture, but improvements in the
products and processes come as a result of research.
One of the notable innovations is the use of what is
best described as pre-threshed leaf. Under this process
tobacco is cleaned of impurities and foreign matter
as soon as it is purchased, so that it matures in clean
condition. This improves the quality of the cigarette.
Rothmans are the first and only manufacturer in
Australia to have this new process in operation.
The past financial year was the first occasion
when sales suffered any setback, but the reason for
this was not a question of changing fashion trends
or brand preferences. The substantial excise change
which was made in 1964 was the first since 1956 and
this produced the customary buyer resistance to
increased outlays. We were not surprised that light-
weight cigarettes in the cheap price class took over
a share of the quality market for a time.
Naturally, the Board considered whether the
Company should enter the cheap market, but it costs
many hundreds of thousands of pounds to establish
a brand, and this could be a short-range expedient if
the market resumed its previous trend to the quality
class.
At this stage it seems probable that this judge-
ment is well-founded. It is early to speak with
certainty, but the further excise increase in 1965 has


not apparently disturbed the market, and the swing
back to quality brands, evident for some months
past, is still continuing. Consumer demand for the
Company’s brands is buoyant and increasing.
Shareholders will realise that the Board is not
complacent about any movement in the market, but
they believe that quality must prevail in a market
where standards of living are high and rising.
The fundamental policy in the Company’s mar-
keting is always to give the best possible quality at
the best possible price and there are some telling
points which stand the Company in good stead:—
1. To date this year, Rothmans have again paid the
highest average prices of any manufacturer at the
Australian tobacco auctions to secure the best avail-
able quality of leaf. Moreover, we have not reduced
the quantity of tobacco in our brands, although a
number of competitive brands did so after the 1964
excise increase. As against that, we have incurred
even more cost to introduce pre-threshed leaf into
our cigarettes to give them a distinct competitive
advantage in quality.
2. The amount of excise duty paid on a packet of
cigarettes is a clear test of the weight. Each of
Rothmans brands pays more excise duty than any
competitive brand selling at the same price and con-
siderably more than cigarettes in the lower price
classes.
3. The Company enjoys real advantages in its
volume of sales, which means that its unit costs of
manufacture and marketing are necessarily lower.
Australian-grown tobacco is now an important
factor in cigarette manufacture. As from Ist January,
1966, every Australian manufacturer is required to
use 50% of Australian tobacco in every brand pro-
duced. Therefore, the standard of quality of the
Australian crop must be a matter of acute concern to
everyone in the industry, and to the consumer.
This year saw the introduction of a Stabilisation
Scheme, and it must be admitted it has had its share
of difficulties in operation. It was unfortunate, too,
that climatic conditions affected the crop in certain
areas, and meant that some tobacco was quite unsuit-
able for use. So far as manufacturers are concerned,
the main point is that the Scheme must be applied
firmly to lift the general standard of quality, not to
guarantee sales of leaf regardless of the suitability for
use. It has always been the Company’s firm policy to
support the local growers who produce to quality
standards, and our policy on this matter stands just as
strongly today. Indeed, to ensure clearance of the
1964 crop, we outlaid more than £2,000,000 to take
up tobacco beyond our known requirements, and this
excess stock must be worked out over a period of
years.
You will realise that the accent in this address
is on quality, (because we stand or fall by it), so it
may seem strange that I refer to retail price-cutting in
this connection.
Unbridled price-cutting can be harmful to manu-
facturers, retailers and consumers. It tends to obscure
the relative merit of products, and it is liable to lead
to reductions in standards of service or product
quality when there is a manufacturers’ price war. It
is also liable to reduce the number of retail outlets,
which no manufacturer wants.
I know at first hand the detailed history of
cigarette price-cutting in Australia, and I know, too,
that my Company has not encouraged it by giving
special deals, directly or indirectly. There is no
discrimination in our price arrangements, and we do
not give any concessions which amount to a rebate not
available to other purchasers. Unfortunately, it is
not legally practicable to enforce conditions of sale
fixing retail prices.
Perhaps the best proof that Rothmans have not
made special deals is to study the notice boards of
price-cutting outlets,-on which it will be seen that the
full range of a competitor’s brands is price-cut,
whereas normally only the two leading brands we
produce are included, and then only because there is
no sense in excluding the market leaders.
We will welcome the advent of Trade Practices
legislation which will eliminate bad practices.
In conclusion, the Board sees another good year
ahead of us, and results to date in both sales and
profits support such a view. We will continue to fight
hard against competition and, above all, we will
continue to make quality the keynote of our
operations.

Chairman.

The Biggest Retailer
A time for Myer
A lthough pipped by Woolworths Ltd
for turnover honors, Myer Em-
porium Ltd once again proved to be
the nation’s biggest retailer in terms of
aggregate profit.
For the year to July 31, Myer profit
was £5,373,541, after £5,132,280 tax
and £1,356,227 depreciation. Net result
was a 16 p.c. improvement over the
previous year. The Sydney subsidiary,
Farmers (Holdings) Ltd, and the
Adelaide subsidiary, Myer (SA) Ltd,
both contributed to the better result.
Turnover was £133.2 million (up 9.5
p.c.) compared with Woolworths’ total
of £137.5 million. (G. J. Coles sold
£114.9 million in 1964-65.)
Earning rate is an impressive 40.8 p.c.
on Myer ordinary capital. Shareholders
are treated to an additional dividend this
year; the rate goes up from 16f p.c. to
171 p.c. This suggests that the company
is approaching the point of another bonus
issue. The last, a one-for-two, was
announced two weeks before the fateful
“squeeze” of November, 1960.
Cum the final dividend of 6d,, the
shares were quoted at 31s. 6d., where
the income return is 2.8 p.c. They should
firm on news of the dividend increment.
To date this year the ss. units have
ranged between the historically low
figure of 295. 2d. and a high of 365. Bd.
At the time of the Farmer merger
(December, 1960), entry to Myers was
possible via Farmer’s shares at what was
then considered (by Australia’s leading
brokers) to be a bargain price of 31s.
By April, 1961, prior to the one-for-two
bonus, they had risen to 38s. 6d.
The lucky investor with liquid re-
sources at this moment could not go far
wrong by buying Myer shares now.
Miller Bonanza
Tn his 1964 report to shareholders, the
chairman of R. W. Miller (Holdings)
Ltd said the Australian coal industry had,
in the face of unfair dumping of residual
oils on the market, survived simply be-
cause of increased efficiency.
The public will remember that Mr
Miller tired of waging war for coal in
the fuel market and decided if “you can’t
beat ’em, join ’em”. With his company’s
experience of the efficient operation of
bulk carriers, it was no great trouble
to move into oil tankers. By the end of
November, 1964, R. W. Miller had, with
three tankers, more than one-quarter
of the total tonnage of Australian-flag
tankers on the Australian coast. Although
at first the return on capital was unsatis-
factory, it was later described as
“lucrative”.
Shareholders are still guessing as to
just how lucrative the tankers’ operation
is, for the preliminary profit report of
a 72 p.c. leap from £668,979 to
£1,150,269 did not give details. They
can, however, be very content with this
showing and the one-for-five bonus an-
nounced simultaneously.
The 10 p.c. dividend is repeated
thrice covered by 1965 earnings. The
unusual mixture of brewing and hotel
keeping, engineering, transport and dis-
tribution of coal, and now oil, with its
own fleet of ships and trucks, gives the
business strength in diversification.
The 10s. shares, which were offered to
the public in mid-1962 at 12s. 6d., sold
for 19s. 3d. (yielding 5.2 p.c.) prior to
these announcements. They will certainly
have a more devoted following in future.

■*■*■*■ ware retailer, is set for an extremely

to June 30 rose from £164,000 to
£168,000, but the result was after writing
off £34,000 in establishment expenses for
the new store. Sales of all the trading
subsidiaries were substantially higher
than in 1963-64. This upward trend has
continued into the current year.
Sales will get a real shot in the arm
from the new store, which has now been
open and trading for more than a week.
It is part of the old Hicks (Reid
Murray) building, stretching from
Bourke to Little Collins Street at the
“Wall Street” end of town. Although the
site is not quite as good as the old one
(on the corner of Elizabeth and Little
Collins), it is less than half a block away
and provides twice the selling area. This
alone should boost sales. The lunch-time
and sale-time crush in McEwan’s is well
known as something to be avoided if
possible, and the new store will eliminate
what had become something of a prob-
lem.
Moreover, the company received
£750,000 for its old site from, need we
say, an unnamed assurance group. With
such proceeds flowing into the coffers,

everything in the camp looks bright.
Shareholders can expect further benefits
in the future, although they have only
recently seen the fruits of a one-for-two
cash issue. For 1964-65, dividend has
been held at 10 p.c. on the higher average
capital, on which the profit equalled
22.5 p.c.
Bad, Bad Debtors

” son (Consolidated) Ltd are released,
they will show a deficit approaching £1
million in shareholders’ reserves.
After bad debts of £177,491, trading
for the June year brought a loss of
£179,989, but directors felt obliged to
provide an extra £426,000 for problem
accounts. Losses of a capital nature ac-
counted for £36,760 and, being as
gloomy as possible, directors provided
£64,300 to cover losses on the contem-
plated sale of assets in this current
period.
Turnover dropped significantly. Profit
margins were also lower in the year
under review.
The latest loss follows a loss of £73,166
in 1963-64. Prior to that, dividends had
been progressively cut from 12i to 10
to 8 p.c. None have been paid for the
last two years.

means of extracting money from debt-

Chairman's Address
MERCANTILE CREDITS LIMITED
Thirtieth Annual General Meeting, Ist October, 1965
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am reporting to you on your Company’s
activities for the 12 months ended 30th June,
1965, at this our Thirtieth Annual General
Meeting. Many investors may have had
concern over some finance companies and,
generally, grantors of instalment credit. I
must tell you that none of the bodies in-
volved were members of the Australian Hire
Purchase and Finance Conference, of which
bank-affiliated companies, including our
own, are members. I shall have something
more to say later about the role of the
Conference in the Australian economy.
With this preamble, I welcome you to the
Meeting and. as usual, my comments are
mainlv directed to the Annual Accounts
which are already in your possession. 1 am
sure vou will agree that these disclose an
excellent result for the year.
The consolidated profit is the highest ever
recorded by the Company and shows an
increase (after provision for taxation) over
the 1964 year of £162,813, equal to 40.54%.
This was achieved in spite of the very keen
competition for the good type of new busi-
ness The earning rate of Net Profit to in-
creased Average Ordinary Paid Up Capital
(after payment of the Preference dividend)
rose to 18.91%. The taxation provision
totals £279,381, some advantage still being
obtained Tom the losses in previous years
of companies acquired by us. All subsidi-
aries. with one exception which 1 will refer
to later, are trading profitably and make a
valuable contribution to the total profit.
Our diversified avenues of finance have
helped us to maintain our position in the
finance field and this is reflected by total
Net Outstandings of £25.802,861, being a
rise for the year of £5,126,055, equal to
24.8%, as compared to 1964. Actual bad
debt*. have been written off and our Auditors
state that in their opinion the provision for
such debts as may be doubtful or in respect
of losses not exactly ascertained appears
to be adequate.
DIVIDENDS
The full preference dividends were paid
on the due dates and totalled £35.000 for
the year. On the Ordinary Shares, an interim
dividend of 6i% was paid in April. 1965,
and your Directors now recommend the
payment of a final dividend of 6i%, thus
making a rate of 121% per annum on the
Ordinary Capital as paid up during the
year ended 30th June, 1965.
SUBSIDIARIES
Mercredits Finance Limited and Mer-
credits Limited, the Group’s two leasing
companies, continue to trade profitably,
whilst at the same time obtaining the benefit
of past losses that were acquired.
Mercredits (W.A.) Limited (formerly
Malloch Bros. Limited) is continuing steadily
to realise its trading stocks and at 30th June
a further loss is reported. During the current
financial year, we will also transact finance
business through this subsidiary.
W.A. Netting & Wire Co. Ltd. continues
to trade profitably but on a lower percent-
age basis and consideration is now being
given to the future, which may mean further
expansion of this subsidiary.
Mercantile Underwood Limited was
formed during the year for the purpose of
acquiring and taking over the major part
of the share investments of the Parent
Company.
DIVERSIFICATION
As you are aware, there are many facets
to the finance field and your Company has
always been appreciative of the benefits to be
gained from being represented in these
ancillary activities.
During the year, therefore, we acquired
an interest in a Building Society, a Com-
mercial Bills Company and an Insurance
Company.
Building Society
Our interest here is in The Langridge
Building Society. Melbourne, which was
established in 1880. A consortium consisting
of Hongkong Finance Pty. Ltd., The Lon-
don Assurance, Unity Life Assurance
Limited and ourselves has acquired in
varied shareholdings the major interest in
this Society.
The Society, which will be under your
Company’s management, will be helping to
meet the need of homeseekers by supplying
funds in this important area. It is not expec-
ted that Mercantile Credits will supply any
significant amount of these funds, which it
is hoped will be raised by loans from the
public on usual Building Society terms.
Commercial Bills
This is a comparatively new activity in
the Australian monetary field and, whilst
our present interest is only nominal, it is
anticipated that it will develop as the use of
commercial bills increases. Our investment
is in Commercial Bills Australia Limited,
a company which acts as a broker in the
discounting of bills of exchange. To date its
activities have been very limited owing to
the present credit stringency.
Insurance
It was only natural that, as our real estate
financing increased, we should consider an
interest in an insurance company which
would underwrite the fire insurance associa-
ted with such business. In this case, we have
acquired a half interest in Westminster
Insurance Company Limited, a small but
progressive company which was incorpora-
ted in 1963.
CAPITAL INCREASE
The increase in capital during the year is
represented by the 5,600,000 ordinary shares
taken up by a wholly owned subsidiary of
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Cor-
poration, about which I reported to you
at the last Annual Meeting. These shares
are now fully paid as the result of a final
call made in August, 1965. The equity in-
vestment by this century-old Institution
now totals £2,100,000.
FUND RAISING
As is customary, we are constantly before
the public raising funds to provide for the
increased business being transacted and to
meet maturing debentures and deposit notes.
Since our last Meeting, the No. 8 Debenture
Issue was opened in November, 1964, and
closed in May, 1965, with a total subscrip-
tion of £1,010,000. Our No. 9 Issue, which
opened in May, 1965, has been filled and
oversubscriptions are being currently invited.
This issue provides a slight increase in rates,
which brings our maximum rate to 7|% for
the longer terms.
In addition to these issues, special private
placements totalled £1,632,850, the total
debenture funds raised for the year being
£2,816,050.
If you are interested, might I suggest you
obtain a copy of the Prospectus of our No.
9 Issue from your stockbroker, the Austra-
lia and New Zealand Bank Ltd. or The
Hongkong Bank Group Representative
Office.
THE FUTURE
This year will continue to offer wide
scope for finance industry operations of a
diversified nature. However, the economic
situation which engendered the tightening
of liquidity shows every sign of continuing
during 1965/66.
Therefore, in common with other Finan-
ciers, shortage of funds may cramp your
Company a little as it is becoming more
difficult to borrow on the open market,
due mainly to the many issues being made
by finance companies and industrial bor-
rowers. Consequently our expansion may
be slower than in the past but, with our
diversifications, we have at present no diffi-
culty in keeping all funds available fully
employed and profits for the current year
should continue on a satisfactory basis.
It will be a period calling for continued
skill in funds management but for finance
industry investors it should not be regarded
as a period of uncertainty. The industry has
entered the new financial year against a
background of continued growth in an in-
creasingly credit-conscious population and
added calls for finance for a broadening
range of commercial purposes. With prudent
management there will be good opportunities
for sound and profitable business.
It is perhaps timely to make some com-
ment on the growth in consumer credit use
in this country.
THE AUSTRALIAN HIRE PURCHASE
AND FINANCE CONFERENCE
The Conference has intensified its national
programme to educate the public in wise
use of credit.
Conference companies firmly believe in
the principle of seeking adequate deposits
to provide users with sound equity in the
goods they obtain on credit. This is one of
the main themes of the current education
programme which the Conference hopes
will assist the further growth in sound use
of the instalment credit system in this
country which has undoubtedly contributed
to the development of our Nation and of
our high living standards.
Three parties have an equal part to play
in determining whether the growth of credit
leads to the growth of sound business or a
growth in bad debts. These are the com-
panies which make credit available, the con-
sumers which use it and the Governments
which make and police the legislation cover-
ing it.
The companies have a responsibility to
extend realistic terms which do not tempt

not vary much from 1963-64), the
group profit of BMI at £1,263,139 was
22.2 p.c. on capital, a reduction from
previous years, but still comfortable
cover for the 15 p.c. dividend.
The BMI group is also enlarged by
the acquisition of lllawarra Fireclay and
Brick Co. Ltd late in 1964.
The impression, which could be gained
by scanning BMl’s figures, that 1964-65
was the best year yet is misleading. It
was, in fact, far from the most profitable
trading period for the blue metal busi-
ness.
Not So Sweet
acßobertson, the “Old Gold” choco-
late firm, is unlikely to provide
anything particularly sweet for share-
holders this year. In the first six months
to June saies rose but profit was lower.
This was mainly a result of increased
manufacturing costs and the higher bills
for marketing and distribution. Accord-
ing to directors, the trend is continuing
in the current half and conditions remain
extremely competitive.
All these factors have led them to
predict that the year-end result will be
“somewhat lower” than for 1964. Share-
holders will not take this news kindly.
Last year, profit rose slightly to equal
11.9 p.c. on capital but, in order to con-
serve funds, directors cut the seven-year-
old 2 p.c. bonus element from the divi-
dend, thus reducing it to 8 p.c. Fund
conservation was necessary to finance
expansion. One hopes that a further cut
will not be necessary this year. The
interim payout has been held steady at
4 p.c.
This year and 1966 will prove very
problematical for directors. As well as
trying to cope with rising competition in
the confectionery field, they are engaged
in a mammoth project to shift the
group’s whole manufacturing operation
out to a brand new factory, currently
under construction. Once this opens, the
operation of two units will be necessary
for a smooth changeover and, as with
Petersville in 1963-64, this will tempor-
arily increase costs and lower profits.
But when the new factory eventually
brings higher efficiency and substantial
costs savings to bear, profits should stage
a reversal from their current downward
trend.
Cleaning Up
A lthough a ,big jump in profit was
expected from Spotless following the
announcement of a higher dividend a
few weeks ago, neither shareholders nor
market observers expected the result to
be accompanied by the news of a one-
for-four bonus issue. Based in Mel-
bourne, the company operates in the
dry-cleaning and general laundry fields.
The profit jump from £82,000 to
£121,000 was attributed by directors to
the acquisition of country plants. There
is little doubt that the firm’s intensive
and successful advertising campaign
played its par. too.
The country plants acquired were at
Moe, Shepparton, Benalla and other
areas. The record profit which they
helped achieve is equal to an extremely
high 48.2 p.c. on present capital. After
the bonus issue, the result would still
equal a buoyant 36.3 p.c. For this reason,
directors expect to maintain the higher
15 p.c. dividend on the increased capital.
With more than double coverage already
and profits still growing, such a pre-
diction should prove easy to fulfil.
The bonus has been made possible by
the timely revaluation of the shares held
in subsidiaries. This revaluation will
create a new reserve from which the
issue is to be made. From small begin-
nings, growth has been so substantial in
the last five years that a revaluation
could almost be considered overdue. The
subsidiaries have increased their returns
to the parent several times. Now the
parent, in turn, has decided to pass these
on to the shareholders. Perhaps further
issues will be made in the future after
the growing country businesses prove
themselves worthy of a revaluation also.
people into over-committing themselves, to
exercise careful management control both
on the classes of business written and also
with regard to collection systems.
Members of the public have the respon-
sibility of carefully assessing their existing
financial obligations before entering into
credit agreements.
The Governments have the responsibility
of ensuring legislation is designed to provide
equal protection to both the companies and
their customers, avoiding possible political
temptation to create a “debtors’ paradise”
where the legal barriers to collection of debts
justly incurred are such that the way is
opened to people to disregard their legal
obligations.
THE BUDGET
In common with all other business organ-
isations, the finance industry welcomes the
decision of the Federal Treasurer not to
increase company taxation.
This demonstrates the Government’s
attention to balancing requirements for in-
creased revenue against the need to avoid
introduction of dampening measures at a
time when there has been some element of
business uncertainty.
The various revenue raising measures
introduced must have some effect on overall
consumer spending in the year ahead. How-
ever, 1 do not believe that they will act as a
restraining factor on further sound develop-
ment of the consumer credit system.
One Budget feature of direct concern to
this industry was the decision to extend
stamp duty on hire purchase transactions
to the A.C.T.
This adds further to the steadily widen-
ing range of stamp duties affecting finance
companies throughout Australia.
This country is virtually unique among
all world nations with advanced credit
systems in the way it uses stamp duties as a
revenue-raising measure against hire pur-
chase business.
Continued extension of this type of stamp
duty must further erode the economics of
this vital form of credit contract.
DIRECTORS
Mr. D. F. P. Roth retires from the Board
by rotation at this Annual Meeting and in
view of Sec. 121 of the Companies Act
does not seek re-election. Mr. Roth estab-
lished the Company in 1935 and as Manag-
ing Director directed its activities until he
retired from that position on the 31st
December, 1959, but continued as a Director
on the Board. He takes with him the best
wishes of the Company during his retire-
ment.
Two new Directors were appointed during
the year, viz. Messrs. J. A. H. Saunders,
D. 5.0., M.C., resident in Hong Kong, and
Cyril J. Stevens of Sydney. They are spon-
sored by our shareholder. The Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Both
retire and are eligible for re-election at this
Annual Meeting.
Mr. Anthony L. Harman is the Repre-
sentative in Australia of the Hongkong Bank
Group and is an Alternate Director for Mr.
J. A. H. Saunders.
STAFF
After listening to this report, I feel sure
you will wish to endorse the Board’s ap-
preciation of the efforts of Management
and Staff in achieving this excellent result.
I now formally move that the Accounts
and Report as tabled be received and, when
this has been seconded, the matter will be
open for discussion.

Chairman.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Success in the Appliance Field
Kelvinator' s “ excessive” accounting items
fThm domestic appliance field has been
a most competitive one for the last
ten years. The record of companies such
as General Industries and Email, which
have a high reputation as manufacturers
of such appliances, would perhaps be
enough to deter any investor from put-
ting his money into this particular in-
dustry. Yet we have one company, Kel-
vinator Australia Ltd, whose main busi-
ness is domestic appliances and air-con-
ditioning equipment and which has never
earnt less than 20 p.c. on ordinary capi-
tal over the last ten years. In fact, one
is inclined to suspect that with somewhat
different treatment of some items in the
accounts the earning rate would have
been in excess of 30 p.c. throughout this
particular decade.
There can be no doubt that the busi-
ness is very competitive, yet it seems
that there is always room for someone
with a good product to make profits.
The history of Malleys since the associa-
tion with Whirlpool seems to be clear
proof of this. However, there is every
possibility that the most important
aspect of the industry is the marketing of
the product. It is perhaps no secret that
Kelvinator’s products were sold under
the HMV brand name for a while some
years ago, but they did not seem to
have the same success. It could well be
that after-sales service forms an import-
ant part of the marketing organisation;
Kelvinator has established service facili-
ties in all the capital cities of Australia.
Another interesting feature of Kel-
vinator’s activities is the way certain
parts of the operation have been gradu-
ally extended until they have been able
to supply not only the requirements of
the group but have also been able to
take on work for other companies. The
plastics division seems to have been the
first division to undertake this expansion;
it has been followed by the tooling sec-
tion. In the 1964 chairman’s address, it
was stated that further investment was
to be made in toolroom equipment which,
it was anticipated, would assist in the
expansion of the “outside” tooling
activities.
Unfortunately, there is no way of
assessing the contributions made by each
section of the activities to the group
profit. In these circumstances, it is prob-
ably correct to assume that domestic
appliances still are the major profit
earner, if only because of the greater
volume of sales. This means that the
company’s future will probably be
affected in the main by the demand for
domestic refrigeration.
At this stage, it may be as well to
take a look at the published accounts
and, particularly, at those items which
are usually considered to be “excessive”.
It must be stated first of all that this
would mean excessive in the eyes of the
Tax Commissioner only so far as the de-
preciation provision is concerned. For
there are many who would feel that the
usual tax allowances fomiepreciation are
quite inadequate and normal business
consideration would demand that higher
provisions be made. A direct comparison
between the depreciation provision made
during the year and the cost of plant at
the beginning of the year reveals the
following percentages:
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
9.0 9.0 10.3 9.7 10.2 11.9 11.9
While it is hardly possible to draw any
conclusion from these percentages, it
does seem that the level of the pro-
vision was raised in 1961 and again in
1964; whether or not the provision ex-
ceeds the Tax Commissioner’s allowances
is impossible to say.
HThe tax provision itself is rather difficult
A to follow in the published accounts.
So far as the 1962-63 year is con-
cerned, an amount of £332.000 was
originally provided in the profit and loss
account and in the balance sheet at the
end of the year another figure. £37,880
less, appears. The following year it is
shown that the tax provision in respect
of the 1962-63 year was understated by
£12,432 and the figure appearing in the
balance sheet under the heading “pro-
vision for taxation on 1962-63 in-
come” was also increased by this amount.
There is no explanation for the original
discrepancy between the profit and loss
statement and balance sheet figures. For
the 1963-64 year, £380,000 was originally
provided in the profit statement, but
£353,003 appeared in the balance sheet.
In the next accounts, the profit state-
ment figure was increased by £15,962 to
£395,962 (“adjusted in line with actual
taxation paid”), but the balance sheet
figure decreased by £151,477 to
£201,526. It is necessary to wait until
next year before the story of the 1964-65
tax provision unfolds; it may be pointed
out at this stage that the profit statement
figure was £505,000 and the balance
sheet figure £55,653 less at £449,347.
After making all the adjustments that
it is possible to make from the pub-
lished accounts, the tax provision for
1963-64 would seem to be overstated
by £56,662. Unfortunately this figure
is £13,703 greater than the difference
between the adjusted profit statement
figure and the original balance sheet
figure. In all the circumstances, I would
find it very difficult to say whether the
tax provision was overstated or the
profit figure understated.
The market seems to have taken the
view that the profits are understated, for
even today the shares are selling at
20s. 9d. to show a dividend yield of
only 3.3 p.c. Admittedly, if the earnings
are adjusted upwards on the basis of the
tax provision, the earnings yield at this
price would be a fairly high 9.1 p.c.
Strangely enough, the investor who de-
cided to purchase the shares five years
ago (at the end of June, 1960, just after
he had examined the annual report for
that year) would have paid precisely
the same price of 20s. 9d. As he now
has five shares where he originally had
four, he has received a 25 p.c. increase
in capital and income. I calculate that
his 1960 investment is showing a re-
turn of about 8 p.c. per annum com-
pound over the last five years including
capital appreciation. Fortunately this
period includes the only bonus issue in
the company’s thirty years’ history. It
would be quite possible for the company
to make another bonus issue on pre-
cisely the same basis at any time and
this could easily occur during the next
five years. This suggests that the investor
today stands to achieve the same return
as his 1960 counterpart. He would need
to make up his mind if 8 p.c. is suf-
ficient.

I.M.T. KICKS KIX SALES
A once-c-week commercial every Wednesday night is boosting the soles of Kix Insect
Powder, Kix Aerosol Insect Killer, and Ratsak rat and mice killer for Amalgamated
Chemicals (Vic.) Pty. Ltd.
The company's agency (Advertising Marketing Pty. Ltd.) created the character of "Sid the Swogman" as a complete departure
from the normal clean, highly-polished sales approach, and with the selling message delivered in a straightforward dinkum
Aussie" manner, the awareness of the company's pro-
ducts has increased tremendously, with a resultant
sales lift.
Both client and agency agree "the image of Kix has
improved more than 100 per cent since the introduc-
tion of the live commercials on 'ln Melbourne Tonight'
—and it is our intention to continue our usage of the
programme and the station as our major promotional
activity in Victoria".

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Note Conversion Problems
Braemar's mediocre earning position
]l/|elbourne-based Braemar Industries
™ Ltd operates in all States through 17
subsidiaries and an associate company
in New Zealand Basically, the group’s
activities cover four different fields. De-
spite this spread, trading is still largely
reliant on the fluctuating fortunes of the
building industry and profits vary ac-
cordingly from year to year,
The engineering section makes a wide
range of appliances at factories in Noble
Park (Vic.), Sydney. Brisbane, Adelaide
and Perth. The main products include
all types ot water-heating appliances, gas
fires, stainless steel sinks, industrial
evaporative air coolers, industrial and
domestic water-softeners, water treat-
ment equipment and various other an-
cillary products. The group is probably
best known for the hot water systems
which this division makes sales of
these are about 90 p.c. dependent on the
home-building industry.
The manufacture of valves and as-
sociated equipment is undertaken by the
STG group. Based in Sydney, these two
companies were acquired in 1953-54
and do not represent an original activity.
Their products are marketed throughout
the whole of Australia. Although it is
dangerous to consider statistics on their
face value alone, many shareholders will
feel that the STG takeover was a mis-
take. In 1953-54 the group’s earning rate
was 24.7 p.c. Following the shares
issued for the takeover, earnings fell to
15.9 p.c. the following year. They have
never complete!} recovered and, in the
year to June 30 last, the record £121,000
profit was still equal to only 18.1 p.c.
on ordinary capital.
The group’s third activity is the manu-
facture of materials handling equipment,
carried out by a subsidiary at the Noble
Park establishment. This activitv. too, has
a sales network throughout the whole of
Australia. Although never particularly
successful, the operation has picked up
considerably over the last two years. The
manufacturing facilities were moved to
their present location and, after consider-
able reorganisation and a promotional
effort, sales and profits extricated them-
selves from mediocrity.
The last activity is the odd one out—
the manufacture of chemicals (mainly
industrial) by the Gardinol company, ac-
quired in 1957-58. From the Box Hill
factory (Vic.) a wide range of acrylic
resins is made, along with detergents and
related products, which are marketed
throughout Australia. Although used in
a number of industries, the best custom-
ers are the chemical, textile, leather,
paper and cosmetic industries. A new
continuous sulphonation plant came into
full-scale production earlier this year,
giving substantial economies. It is with
this division that the New Zealand as-
sociate has its strongest connection. It
operates from New Plymouth under the
name of Watkins-Gardinol Chemicals
Ltd.
The basic feature of the group has
been a capacity to pay steady dividends,
even in the worst years. From 1949-50
to 1959-60 the payout was 10 p.c., with-
out fail, every year. It was only in 1959-
60 that the payout was uncovered, as
the accompanying table shows. Dividend
was cut to 8 p.c. in 1960-61, after earn-
ings failed to recover. It has been held
at this level ever since. Although earn-

jngs were only 0.1 p.c. in 1961-62, main-
tenance of the payout was made pos-
sible by drawing on the £70,000 divi-
dend equalisation reserve. In fact the
reserve was completely wiped out.
Issues to shareholders have not been
a feature. The last one was a one-for-
five at par in 1951-52 following the rec-
ord 34.9 p.c. earnings in the previous
year. In 1959-60 the 10s. shares were
split to ss. units. Although the earning
rate is now well above the dire 1961-62
year and quite healthy, an issue is still
very unlikely.
The basic reason is the £351,250 note
conversion due at balance date next
year. It will lift ordinary capital from
the present £606,792 to slightly more
than £958,000. On this basis the 1964-
65 profit is equal to an earning rate of
only 11.5 p.c. Even taking the £25,000
annual interest saving into account, the
resultant earnings of 14.1 p.c. would
hardly make an issue wise if the 8 p.c.
dividend was to be maintained. More-
over, shareholders would be more in-
terested in a restoration of 10 p.c. divi-
dends than an issue at this stage. And it
must not be forgotten that any decision
to replace the loan moneys with new
borrowings after conversion would
eliminate the interest saving.
Add to these factors the somewhat
unencouraging outlook for the current
year and Braemar seems destined to con-
tinue. 8 p.c. dividends and mediocre earn-
ings for some time yet. The record 1964-
65 profit represented a 6 p.c. rise over
the previous year. This was extremely
poor when one considers that profits in
the first half of the year were higher
by 21 p.c. Directors have reported that
the last quarter of the year was affected
by a decline in the level of new dwelling
constructions. More importantly, they
stated that this trend had continued into
the current year.
This state of affairs illustrates only too
well the heavy reliance on the home
building industry. Although the manu-
facture of chemicals, valves and mech-
anical handling equipment went on ap-
parently unaffected, the downturn in
building had drastic results. This is the
factor which should be kept in mind if
an investment in the shares is being con-
sidered.
The table shows varying trends for
current assets, the big 1962 drop being
due to a reduction in stocks. Current lia-
bilities show similar trends, the big
moves in 1961, 1962 and 1963 being
mainly due to changes in bank over-
draft. The overall effect has been to re-
duce working capital quite substantially
but it still remains at adequate levels.
Fixed assets show gradual growth and
intangibles are negligible, representing
expenses of note issues. Capital has
varied little. It will jump at the end of
the current year with the note conver-

ston. However unsatisfactory this may
seem, it will be better than a straightout
redemption, for which the group would
almost certainly have to find further loan
capital. Reserves are low, but have re-
covered from the 1962 setback when
they were drawn on to pay the dividend.
Unfortunately, the group’s 1965 accounts
are not yet available.
Tax seems tc have been a little over-
provided in some years. Profits, earning
rate and the surplus reflect the recovery
of the last few years. Yields have al-
ways been fairly attractive. Share prices
have not been above 10s for some time
and do not look like getting above that
level for some time to come.
To sum up: At current prices of 6s.
and yielding a high 6.7 p.c. from the
dividend, the shares are good for in-
come purposes only. However, any in-
vestor should keep a close eye on the
rate of new building as any continuing
downward trend, combined with the note
conversion next year, could well neces-
sitate a dividend cut. Conversely, any
increase in the rate of building may re-
sult in a restoration of 10 p.c. dividends.
Undoubtedly this would have been made
during any of the past three years had
it not been for the impending note con-
version.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Culling the Annual Reports
Plus “The Keith Harris Story"
A 29-PAGE booklet titled “The Keith Harris Story” has arrived on my desk. I
have the suspicion that the publication is an attempt to combat the criticism
of the £109,000 gift being made to the retiring managing director, Mr Keith Harris.
At the end of the booklet is a little table showing how well a shareholder would have
done since 1948.
A shareholder who purchased 100
shares for £4l then would now find that
his investment was worth £916. As 1
said in the Diary a few weeks ago, all
the credit for this performance is due to
the management. Shareholders should
accordingly feel grateful.
Because, however, the management
themselves (in particular Mr Keith
Harris) are large shareholders, they also
have benefited from this prosperity. Why
then should Mr Keith Harris turn around
now and reward himself with £100,000?
It makes a mockery of public companies
and “public shareholders”. The average
investor has done so poorly in recent
years that such selfish acts as this can
only cause further disillusionment about
the stock market.
On the second last page of the booklet
is a random selection of Press comment.
No doubt, by oversight, they have
failed to quote my comment made two
weeks ago. In very sober terms I con-
cluded then that “huge lump sum pay-
ments are not generally in the interest
of shareholders”.
Reading seems to be the order at this
time of the year, for it is the annual
report season. Apart from the colorful
covers, annual reports are generally
fairly dull affairs. Occasionally, though,
one comes across some unusual com-
ment. The directors’ remarks in the
Gillespie Bros Holding Ltd annual report
is such a case. To quote the paragraph
headed directors’ fees: “Fees paid to
directors are out of line with current
practice and it is proposed that the total
of such fees payable to the four non-
executive directors be fixed at £3OOO per
annum.” Quite a jump from the total
of £l5OO paid in 1964! If the trade
unions attempted to double the basic
wage on the same reasoning, there would
be hell to pay.
Annual reports do have their uses in
showing the significant changes in assets
and liabilities. Last year I remember
commenting specifically on A. G. Sims.
It was a copybook exercise of the success-
ful rehabilitation of a company. Lack
of working capital had been the main
problem, but the position was dramatic-
ally altered in 1964 when the current
ratio rose from 1.08 to 1 up to 1.89 to 1.
This year the emphasis swung over to
the implementation of a capital expendi-
ture programme. After making adjust-
ment for the sale of part of the Morts
Dock property, fixed assets increased by
£782,000. Under this management there
still seems to be plenty left in the shares.
Last week I expounded my views on
current rights issues and then proceeded
to make a small purchase of W. Adams
rights. This week I continued the exercise
by buying 200 BHP rights at 245. 9d.
For any of the following three reasons
I figured the rights should rise. First of
all, in line with other companies making
issues, the shares cum the rights had
fallen heavily. Secondly, the fall in the
share price before the issue was probably
more acute because of the forced selling
by Americans. And thirdly, on the eve
of the issue, directors announced an
increase in the dividend to lid.
At present prices the old shares are
showing a 4 p.c. dividend yield a
vivid contrast from when the shares were
yielding under 2 p.c. a few years ago.
While this will probably have no effect
in the short term, it’s bound to be
appreciated when interest rates return
to more normal levels.
The only sale this week was the Talcott
Factors at 4s. 9d. The very satisfying
reaction gave me a profit of £l4.
Transactions for the week were:

the old man is still young. The special warmth of 18 years old award winning

when you say “Good luck”.
