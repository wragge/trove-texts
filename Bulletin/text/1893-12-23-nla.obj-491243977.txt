to be worth a Guinea

and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain in

dizziness, and drowsiness,
cold chills, flushings of

(Published at Sydney, N.S. \V.)
Tlie Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil

“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
This Bulletin favours—
'A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comnlete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded,
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
m The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. I hey are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
Form printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever stm.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege— the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the cla’ins of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, ae-ainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected witli any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushtnan of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and moat
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

A Resident of London.
Mb. John King, of N 0.17 Sturgeon
Road, Surrey Garden’s Estate, S.E.,
says:—“l feel so delighted that I
must write toyou about the Truss I
had of you. I have had no trouble
with it or seen any rupture since I
have worn your Truss. It fits so easy
that I don’t notice that I have got a
Truss on. I d on’t worry now as I did
with the old steel trusses.! can j ump
off and on ’busses with safety: can even dance, and no sign
of its return; i t holds everything firm and sure.”
From Belize, British Honduras.
Mr. J.ToMASELU,of the Government House, under date
of December 9,1892, writes; —“On the 11th of last April 1 got
one of your trusses and it has already nearly cured me of a
very bad rupture of about 26 years’ standing. I tried all
kinds of trusses, but they made me worse. Your Truss has
done what doctors and trusses have not been able to do in
26years. You may publish my letter for the good of the
afflicted.
Latest from New Zealand.
Mr. T.W.Nabbey, of Akaroa, Canterbury, inaletterdated
Feb. 21,1893, says: “I received the Truss in good orderand am
gladtosay itfitsmelikeagltme. I can rid e with ease, lift,in fact,
do anything, and'don’t feel sore or chafed. No more steel
trusses forme while I can get one of yours.”

Tonsorial Diagnosis.—A Story for
Surgeons only.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I hate the smell of iodoform, and that s
why I used rather to avoid my friend Barker
Browne. Poor fellow, he died yesterday had
fairly wasted away. .
The doctor told me 8.8. died of an affection of
the tonsils.
* * •
I took my usual shave this morning at my
usual barber’s. Confound it! The place reeked
with iodoform.
“ I see your friend Mr. Barker Browne is dead
—lather—“ poor feller !” —scrape —“ I shaved him
when he was bad” —tickle —‘‘and I shaved the
corpse this morning shaving-brush all oyer my
nostrils. “Doctor said he was consumptive ’
blob !—“but I didn’t believe him”— taking in the
slack skin of my neck —“a man with the roof of
his mouth gone ” —gash ! —“ centreboard of his
nose absent ” —squirt!—“ hovy do you like this
razor, sir? I only broke it in this morning ”
dry rub—“.no, sir ; he couldn’t kid me ” —perfume
—“ thank you, sir; good morning, sir.”
I shave myself now.
CLOSE SHAVE.
“The Wombat” writes, taking Henry
Lawson severely to task for some of his bitter
utterances in “ Popular Australian Mistakes,
rebuking him for his ignorance respecting
“ mirages,” “ deserts,” “ mountains,” &c., and
giving geographical facts that tumble up the poet-
joker j—•
Tae manager is not called the “super ” now, but he
was in the old days ; and H.L. is w rong in saying he is
called the “ overseer ; ” he”is usually called “ the boss,
and rarely referred to as the overseer. A swag is gener-
ally called “ bluey ; ” then comes “swag,” and lastly
“ Matilda,” but the latter term is seldom used out
west. During 17 years’ experience out back, I have
never yet, to my recollection, once heard one
man ask another to “ have some tucker, mate
the generally - favoured mode of invitation is
“ Better come and have a feed, mate,” or “ Will you have
a drink of tea, mate?” Swags are carried all ways, and
any half-dozen travellers met promiscuously would pro-
bably be found each to be carrying his swag differently.
The "horse-collar” is the most uncomfortable, and, con-
sequently, the least-used style ; the “strap over one shoul-
der” style is most used. For general ease and comfort, I
recommend the knapsack style. The term, “nose-bag” is
not used out-back, but is confined to the farming and
settled districts ; out west the bags are “ tucker-bags,
or “ ration-bags ” —generally the former. The shearing-
shed (as H.L. truthfully says) it the most degrading hell
on the face of the earth. Of “ the poetical bushman and
the Australian blackfellow ” I may have something to
say on some future date. If “Jim doesn't tell pathetic
yarns in bad doggerel jn the shearers’ hut," why is H.L.
eternally making other men do what he says “Jim
doesn’t do?
Another of those unfinished yarns about
the royal family in which the soul of the loyal
Bull delighteth is going round the English papers.
Some time ago, it seems, Princess Maud of Wales
visited a French watering - place incognito—
which means that she was alias Smith or some-
thing like that. For a while everything went
well, but the princess and her attendant gorgon
began to notice that a young man was evidently
“ mashed ”on the former lady. At all events he
raised his hat to her on two occasions, and on the
second occasion the gorgon with much difficulty
restrained herself from shrieking for the police.
Finally, however, the young man filled up the
measure of his iniquity by leaving a basket of fresh
spring flowers for the nice-looking girl who was
alias Smith. Then the gorgon sent for him and
fixed her spectacles on him, and shook her mittens
at hiqi threateningly. “ Sir,” said she, in a deep
and awful voice, “ your intrusive and ill-bred be-
haviour compels me to betray our incognito. The
lady whom you have taken the liberty of address-
ing is the Princess Maud of Wales.” Then the
story ends abruptly like all the other stories of
outrages upon the royal family. That is the un-
satisfactory feature about them —you never know
what becomes of the wilted victim. The presump-
tion is that he crawls away and dies miserably, or
that his reason gets off its throne with the shock
and he is now a helpless lunatic in an asylum ; or
he may have taken an attic somewhere, and started
business as a hermit vith white flowing hair
and toe-nails of immense length, and have his vic-
tuals thrown in to him by his landlady because he
has taken a vow never again to be seen of men.
It, is all a matter of conjecture, for the story never
finishes definitely.
Colemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Ex. is the strongest.
Editor Bulletin, —Be Bushranger Power.
About seven years ago, a most respectable old
party, judging by the black clothes, cravat, and
top-hat, set off by a Parkesian wealth of con-
trasting white hair and beard, came to Melb.
Hospital, suffering from a painful bladder-
affection. Before being relieved he begged for
chloroform, and during its administration at
first was quiet, till he felt King Ohio,
getting the upper hand, when a fierce battle
took ipi ace. Wild scenes of the past were acted
over again for our benefit (in chloroformo veritas,
now being considered not quite a lie—happy
thought! why not chloroform De Jong ?) till those
around began to wonder who the respectable old
party could be. Next day it was found that he
was Power. In the wards he complained of the
crowd and the confinement, and begged for the
privilege of erecting a tent in the grounds where
he could live or die in peace. To the writer he
confided that the real cause of his being run to
earth was the affection under treatment, which
had harassed him for many years, and this some-
what bears out your correspondent, for the
popular remedy for such maladies is gin, and
often much gin. Shortly before the old highway-
man’s disappearance he called again about a
troublesome molar tooth, which he carried away
carefully in his pocket, to the disappointment of
the writer, who had reckoned upon adding it to
the historical relics of this tradition-lacking
country. If Power went out under the Murray
waters as he went off under chloroform he died
hard.—A Geopkk. 27/11/’93.

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

Tom Perrot.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Something less than 15 years ago, the old
Rob Roy, with her consort, the'Susan, was on
the Murrumbidgee, a day or two’s distance from
Swan Hill, bound for the lower river, laden with
piles.
some little time previously, a Swede hail gob
ids foot jammed between the tow-rope and the bit.
He bellowed so lustily that the boat was sent
astern and his foot was released before too much
injury was done. On that occasion, Perrot sung
out: “ Stow yer bellowing, you baby"; you
couldn’t make more fuss if I was shutting my
fists.” The Swede sulkily muttered —“ It’ll be
your turn next, and see how you’ll like it.”
On this occasion, the mooring lines had been let
go, the plank taken in, the signal go-ahead rung
out. Suddenly Perrot, standing in a loose coil of
the tow-line, was drawn rapidly three times round
the bit, once round the stem-head, and into the
river. A gallant rescue of his mangled body was
effected. All about the fore-deck, and for a score
of feet along the piles, blood lay coagulating ;
thickened here and there with bits of splintered
bone and quivering flesh, pieces of which even
were afterwards found in the bargeman’s “ tucker-
Can.”
Perrot, with legs literally torn from the hip-
sockets, with only the sinews connecting with the
trunk, was laid in the Rob Roy’s cabin. When
he heard a proposition made to take him back
with the boat, single-handed, to Swan Hill, he
said, in a surprisingly fir-m voice—“No lads;
stand by, all of you. I want you all to see the
last of me. It won’t be long. Skipper, don’t
move the boat; there’s nothing can be done for
me. But I ain’t agoing to sing out.”
Holding a mate’s hand in each of his own, Tom
Peraot “slipped his lines,” grit to the last.
* * *
A butcher-boy who was once going from
Wilcannia by the Pilot, “ home to see his mother,”
also got foul of the tow-rope, and had his foot
taken clean off. He was got ashore, and when he
saw the foot, boot and all, drifting about in the
slack water, demanded that it should be restored
to him. “Cos it’s my property,” he said.

The How-we-beat-the-favourite
Affliction.
( FOR THE BULLETIN. )
It started at first in the brains of one Gordon
.*.(He blew them out after and somewhat atoned);
Each ass is his echo—encoring—encored on—
A plague on posterity, never condoned.
All ages, from infancy up to virility,
Record how the ring-men were yelling, “Dead
heat! ’*
The tremulous voicing of gummy senility
Out-gibbers—“ And that’s how the fav’rite was
beat I”
Attend at a concert, if you are aesthetic,
To soften your spirits, hr bolster them up ;
It’s twenty to one you will get that emetio
Worn-to-rags lay of the Loamshire Hunt Cup.
Soprano sings first of the “Scenes that are
brightest; ”
By bassoyoulre rooked on the waves of the deep;
The tenor’s voice trills, in sweet notes of the
lightest;
Contralto attunes you to languorous sleep.
Bat, next, you’re aroused by a din of hoarse
cheering,
A wide, scarlet nostril flits close to your knees;
Some donkey is on to the platform careering,
And, hopeless, you see that he’s got the disease.
And then you hear all the old fatuous drivel —
How he was left sailing in front of them all;
Disgusted, you pick up your girl, and locked level
Discarding all eunning, you race from the hall.
It’a,the same at all socials and picnics and parties,
Dissenting, or Roman, or Orangeman’s Pup—
You’re told by the Atkinses, Dugalds, and
Flahertys,
“Be calm: and they think you may just win
the Cup.”
One sentiment only in which you can revel,
On searching the dirge from its finish to start,
Is the short fervent prayer that is muttered by
Neville,
It wakens an echo in every heart.
We’ve beared it recited aboard of the Cuzco ;
The boys of “ the Never ” can’t let it go by ;
From the loftiest summit of Mount Kosciusko
Its lines have been yelled to the suffering sky.
It’s poisoned the life of the old sage of Ha warden’
He’s sharpening his axe, and he’s pickling his
rod,
For he’s going to brain or to castigate Gordon—
He doesn’t know yet Gordon’s under the sod.
I’m weak andTm limp; I am weary and ailing;
I’ll never enjoy the same vigour again ;
But—“ Giles, on the Greyling, came down at the
paling ” —
I fear, by my soul! that I’m going insane.
“ Keep back on The Heifer; lie by on The
Mullock;
Back you, sir, on Fig-leaves ; sit still on The
Hag;
Slide down on The Rainbow ; turn round on The
Bullock ;
So, steady there—easy—and up went the rag.’’
May The Clown, at the stud, prove completely
* defective,
And drift, at the last, to the shafts of a cart;
May Iseult, with pain, feel the “ damns ” and
invective
Of thousands of sufferers gnaw at her heart.
May the lampers annoy them, the glanders attack
them,
The heaves and bronchitis e’er torture their
breath,
May greasy heels lame them, and thoroughpin
rack them.
And spavins and bota bring them down to their
death.

According to Yic. railway regulations,
the members of Speight’s household were entitled
to “ Occasional passes to persons constantly form-
ing part of an olncer’s family, not exceeding six
in each year.” “Ours would not work out to
that number,” said Speight in the witness-box.
As a matter of fact, Speight’s large family did
very little free travelling in the whole course of
his nine years’ reign, and his daughters used to
bemoan the fact that “Pa ” wouldn’t get passes
for them.

The N.S.W. Deadlock.
A few days ago the cumbersome machine of
Party Government broke down badly in New
South Wales, and that province is now
without a Parliament, and practically with-
out a Government. Also it is without a
people so far as concerns the purposes of the
Electoral Act; for the old constituencies
have been abolished, and the new ones are
not yet in working oi’der, therefore these is
no power which can create a new Legislature
or a new Government. This curious dead-
lock arose, ostensibly, out of the culpable
conduct of the Attorney-General and Minister
for Justice in accepting briefs against the
State while at the same time they drew large
salaries for defending State interests—in
other words, they tried to serve two masters,
and to be paid by plaintiff and defendant at
one and the same time. The matter was not
one which affected the Cabinet as a whole,
and there was no earthly reason why the
Government should have fallen owing to the
personal greed of two of its members. But
Premier Bibbs, whose leading vices are a
great and comprehensive gratitude, and a
fixed resolution to stand by his colleagues
whether they are right or wrong, but
principally when they are wrong, because
then there is a greater prospect of that free
fight in which his soul delights, chose to
make it a Government question, and as a
consequence the Ministry was defeated by
21 votes. Thereupon Parliament was unex-
pectedly prorogued, and the badly-defeated
Cabinet remains, for the time at least, in
possession.
» • *
Since that memorable defeat every paper
in Now South Wales has been vociferating
on the subject either from the Government
or the Opposition standpoint. The Foreign-
trade press has systematically cursed the
Ministry with a great and bitter curse, and
has dragged innumerable blue-moulded pre-
cedents from their congenial dust, and
hunted up innumerable worm-eaten authori-
ties to throw at the heads of the Bibbs
Cabinet, But, in reality, neither party’s
view of the case is a matter of any special
moment. In the first place, the Opposition,
as a whole, was absolutely and utterly
indifferent to the moral aspect of the
transaction. The majority of 69 which
voted against the Government consisted
of about 50 members who always vote
against the Government, and about 19
others who turned the scale, presumably
from motives of genuine patriotism. Ihe
Foreign-trade leader, who expects to inherit
the Premiership when the moral stench of
the whole business drives the Dibbs Ministry
from office, did not personally move in the
matter, because to him it was merely an
interesting point of legal etiquette; he was
so utterly unable to realise that anybody
could seriously object to the attitude of the
two Ministers that he let his opportunity
pass, and but for the action of a private
member the transaction would presently
have dropped out of sight. His present
attitude of horror is merely a matter of
party politics. And the action of the Cabinet
in demanding, almost in so many words,
that the Assembly should whitewash the
utrly transaction and declare it to be al-
together commendable, was also strictly in
keeping with the traditions of party
politics. The leading axiom of the party
system is that one section of the House
shall declare everything done by the Govern-
ment to be utterly horrible and bad, whether
it is bad or not, and that the other section
shall declare everything which the Govern-
ment does to be absolutely spotless and
good, whether it is good or not. Under
these circumstances the Cabinet was bound
to defend Messrs. Barton and O’Connor,
and the Opposition was hound to attack
the n, and whether both parties were sincere,
or whether one of them was sincere and, if
so, which one it was, or whether both of
them were purely mercenary and hypocritical,
are merely matter's of conjecture.
* # •
Also, the unwonted resolution of the Dibbs
Cabinet to remain in office after its defeat
matters very little, apart from the fact that
sundry dusty precedents have been badly
damaged thereby. As it was impossible for
a new Ministry to be re-elected till the new
const tueucies were in working order, the
Cabinet would probably have had to remain
in office in any case till the general election.
Moreover, the great principle of party, so
far as the Ministry is concerned, is that it
shall remain in office to the last gasp
whether the country wants it or not, and the
conduct of the Bibbs Government, in hanging
on to the bitter end, is only in keeping with
the oldest traditions of Government by
Contradiction. If the Cabinet had resigned
so long as there was one solid object left
to hold on to, it would have been false to
every axiom of politics ; the only difference
between it and any other Cabinet was that
the suspension of the Electoral Act gave it
an opportunity of holding on longer than
usual. In any and every case the one
enduring principle is to hold on, and the
Bibbs Ministry was true to the spirit, if not
to the letter, of the unwritten law. By-
and-bye, if Party Government continues to
develope on its present lines, defeated
Ministers will cease to resign at all, and will
have to be formally dismissed and then
dragged out of their offices by violence, or
ejected with the fire hose, or turned out by
means of stink-pots.
• # #
The real trouble is not that Dibbs remains
in, for, so far as men, apart from measures,
are concerned, the country cares very little
whether Dibbs remains in or not. Nor is it
that G. H. Reid remains out, for the people
of New South Wales will cheerfully let that
ephemeral humourist remain out for all
eternity. It is not even the alleged injury
done to the “constitution” that is in ques-
tion, for nobody really knows what the con-
stitution is, or how it has been injured. But
through this abject squabble almost the
whole work of the session baa been fooled
away and utterly wasted. This also,
by the way, is strictly in keeping with
party tradition. For another of the prin-
ciples of Party Government is that the
Legislature exists solely in order that the
Government may keep in office if it can, and
that the Opposition may get into office if
possible, and therefore the great business of
each party is to keep the other party from
doing anything so as to bring it into public
discredit. And the country must endorse
any and every act of meanness, folly,
treachery, or dishonesty done by the party
in power under penalty of bringing the
public business to a standstill ; it cannot
object to a single act done by a Protectionist
Government, unless it is prepared to go the
entire animal in the direction of Foreign-
trade, or to a single member of the Govern-
ment without reducing everything to sudden
chaos. Therefore, because the country was
not prepared to declare that the proceedings
of Messrs. Barton and O’Connor were alto-
gether praiseworthy, half-a-dozen urgent
measures and about 50 bills of less import-
ance have gone to wreck, and the whole
business of the country has come to a dead
stop. The nation at large has either got to
cordially approve of the hungry avarice of
two uninteresting lawyers, or else sacrifice
its entire public policy, and start the work
of the last twelve months afresh.
# # •
The party system has been a dismal
mockery since its first inception. Under its
operation the Legislature has practically no
control over the appointment of the subor-
dinate Ministers, and very little over that of
the Premier. It cannot reject one member
of the Cabinet, no matter how foolish or
degraded he may be, with- ut rejecting th
whole lot. It cannot object to or reverse a
single important public act of any one office-
holder without turning the whole Cabinet
out of office. lb cannot expel a single
Minister or reverse any act of a single
Minister without abjuring the whole policy
of the Ministry, and handing itself over
bound hand and foot to another gang of
political adventurers who are equally irre-
sponsible. It is always putting up with all
manner of insults, sins, and shortcomings
lest something worse should happen to it.
The whole system is a mass of utter irre-
levance and incoherence. There is no con-
nection between the Mining on Private
Property Bill and the yearning of Messrs.
Barton and O’Connor after private
fees earned at the expense of the public
interests, nevertheless that much-ueeded
measure, which would have afforded em-
ployment to many hungry and workless
citizens, has to be sacrificed in order thab
the country may be able to formally com-
plain of the private hog-selfish ness of these
two lawyers. It was only by deliberately
sacrificing it and a dozen other bills of more
or less importance that the Legislature could
express its disapproval of their conduct.
And it would be quite as logical, and a good
deal cheaper, and at least equally to the
point, if the authorised method of objecting
was by setting fire to the Cathedral, or by
the leader of the Opposition running amok
down George-street, Sydney.
The Desolation which is to Come.
The following Woman’s Suffrage report, ex-
tracted from Melb. Age, is cordially recom-
mended as cheerful reading for the general
public :
Melbourne, Thursday.—A demonstration was held to-
night at the Congregational Church in favour of the
extension of the franchise to women. There was a very
large attendance of women and girls, and no less than
15 resolutions were carried, providing for reforms of a
most sweeping and drastic character. The suppression
of smoking altogether was one of the modest demands,
while the removal of the penny-in-the-slqt cigarette
machines from railway-stations and the abolition of the
liquor-traffic were asked for. Protests were also entered
against theatrical performances and Sunday trains.
The above is an instructive picture, or rather
the beginning of a picture, of the world that is
to be if ever the truly pious and stupid woman
becomes a political majority in the land. Also
it is a picture of what will be if ever the truly
pious man becomes supreme, only the male of
the human species is less devout than the female,
and the chance of a regime of male snufflebusters
is consequently more remote. It is a lurid
illustration of the desolation that is to come—
the desolation of a world of Cold Tea, the
dead level of monotony that will be achieved
when every joyous sin is abolished, and only the
virtues and a few oppressively dreary iniquities
are left. It foretells the coming of an age of
slow and long-dragged-out psalm-tunes ; a day
when all the human race will keep time in one
solemn goose-step on the road to a church where
black-coated and black-hatted men will tell
them solemn things in solemn monotones about
an exceedingly unpleasant hereafter. Then he
who desires to smoke will rise up in the middle
of the night and smoke secretly in a lonesome
place contrary to Act of Parliament, and who-
soever desires to chew tobacco and expectorate
will go out fearfully into the exact centre of
some great wilderness and there expectorate in
disguise and under a false name. Then the
land will be possessed by the evil spirit of
Ginger Beer and it will become a nightmare.
There will be no ale in these times, and no
oysters, because they lead to stout and late
hours, and every man will be officially smelt
twice a day by a duly-constituted authority on
the look-out for signs of concealed liquor.
Further, there will be no more billiards or
cards or dice or horse-racing or any other form
of gambling or dissipation whatever, and no
man shall plug any other man on the eye or
elsewhere, for the gate-money or otherwise,
and the world in general will be painfully good
in these days of the desolation which is to come.

Evidently there is a period of monotony
coming in the earth’s chronicle. A great deal
of the mystery has died out of life, to begin with.
The hand of Satan no longer reaches up above
the waters of the black Atlantic to drag down
passing ships ; the gods are mostly dead, and
the powers of evil are mostly dying. That
strange region where the mariner used to get to
the outer rim of the world, and fall over in an
eternal fall which lasted until he was wrecked
against tne constellation of Hercules or there-
abouts, has been anxiously looked for and has
proved to be non-existent. So has that alleged
locality in the far southern seas where the sun
goes out for ever, and the waters slope down-
hill, and lost ships sail onandon down agliddery
steep till the crews die of old age in the dark-
ness, and the vessels themselves become coffins
sliding eternally on the inclined roof of an up-
ended ocean that leads to nothing recognisable.
The sea-serpent of good old Bishop Pontoppi-
dan is worn out. The world has lost faith in
that ancient geographer who used to account
for unknown lands by the brief inscription
on the map: “This country is all full of
devils.” The mystic region on the east of
the Caspian Sea which used to be marked:
“The Ends of the Earth” has lost its mysticism,
The world has been mostly explored to a
greater or less degree, and it has proved itself
to be pretty much alike, the principal differ-
ence being that some parts of it are rather more
alike than others.

A good many favourite varieties of romance
also show signs of old age and senile decay. War
has become too much a matter of turning a
handle and then watching the butchery that
ensues. A vast number of picturesque though
dirty races have been, or are steadily being,
civilised off the surface of the globe, and many
picturesque though objectionable animals are
fast being extirpated. Evidently the time
must come when this earth will lie a profoundly
serious region of men and cows and very little
else. And when exploration is dead because
there is nothing left to explore; and many
varieties of adventure are exploded because the
opportunity for them is gone ; and war ceases
to be romantic because it becomes pure, un-
varnished murder, and because the warrior
simply hangs to an automatic butchery pump
until he is killed; and when, through
the medium of the pious Congregational
female of the future, drink and tobacco
have been abolished, and fiction has been
suppressed because it is demoralising, and
gambling has been utterly wiped out in all
its varieties, and the “age of consent” has
been raised to 70 or thereabouts, and there is
no more drama or comedy, and sport has died
a natural death because no one is allowed to
bet on the game, and no one is permitted to use
a strong expression even when he steps on a
tack in the dark, and there is no more ballet or
nigger minstrelsy, and love has been put down
because it is a fleshly emotion, and all the
world is in its solitary bed by ten—then this
earth will have got down to the cow-level for
good. A great horror of Cold Tea will lay hold
of it, and there will be nothing to live for
except the changeless, unchangeable monotony,
in wliich not even one cheerful sin will remain
to lighten the oppressive goodness of mankind.
• * *
The upheaval of the good Congregational
female is significant in more ways than one.
Her objections, are all directed against the sins
that man indulges in. The proposed abolition
of the theatre is partly based on the fact that,
owing to her ownexcessivegooduess, shehaslittle
real personal knowledge of itand its ways; partly
on the assumption that her husband is pursued
there by the gold-washed female who is partly
real and mostly legendary; and mostly on
Mademoiselle D’Argo’s legs. The enthusiasm
which is raised in the soul of man by these
solid and bounceable extremities is to her in-
comprehensible and therefore sinful. She does
not really desire to suppress the theatre in toto,
but she does want to suppress D’Argo’s two
powerful supports, and Bartho’s rythmical
dance, and the ballet in general, and to ex-
tinguish everything theatrical except “ East
Lyue”and afew weeping productions of the same
order—and possibly Charles Ryley’s beautiful
calves and the lovely smile of Mr. Roberts at
Sydney Royal. Similarly, she desires to abolish
tobacco because she doesn’t smoke, and liquor
because she doesn’t drink, whereas, in the
great drama of life, her male relatives are con-
tinually going out between the acts to see a
man. She proposes to abolish gambling, too,
because, as a rule, she doesn’t gamble, and if
she does she never pays when she loses ; and to
utterly prohibit the peimy-iu-the-slot machine
which is loaded up with cigarettes—though
nothing is said about the one which supplies
damp, muggy packages of stickjaw and similar
abominations. The good Congregational female,
in short, is a whale on the sins of man in all
their varieties.

But the crusade stops there. There is
nothing about the sin of an undue consumption
of confectionery, nor about abolishing overmuch
loquacity over the back fence ; nor about the
iniquity of “shopping,” which generally con-
sists in making a weary atom of humanity
unroll two tons of goods to no purpose, and
then leaving him in the lurch. There is no
mention made of that kind of debauchery which
is based, not on alcohol, but on the earl with
the unnaturally long legs in the London
Journal. Ami in all the crusades against im-
morality there is never a mention of the
necessity for raising the age of consent as
regards the unduly elongated nobleman in the
Journal, though half the womanhood of Aus-
tralia and Great Britain elopes mentally and in
a vision, with that pictorial hero every time he
is published. The necessity for raising the age
of consent in the matter of the blastiferous
peer in the cheap serial, and preventing girls of
tender years falling victims to his fascinations
regularly once a month, has not received the
attention it deserves. Further, there is nothing
in the programme about the abolition of the
tuneless piano drunkenness, or about the en-
forcement of cleanliness by Act of Parliament.
As the average civilised man has a bath about
twice as often as the average civilised woman
this latter point might have come in for a good
deal of serious notice.
# # •
The programme of the Congregational female
is practically the abolition of sin, and this
world will be a solemn place when sin is abol-
ished. History consists almost entirely of it;
so do biography, fiction, drama, religion, ad-
venture, and nearly everything else which
makes up the story of mankind. When it is
abolished the world will be a dull and arid
waste, and the glacial epoch of Cold Tea will
be a great affliction, and an incubus on the soul
of five continents, and it will be about time for
man to start out for another planet. There are
many theories about the final death of humanity,
including death by frost when the sun grows
cold and becomes a mere cinder in the blackened
sky, death by water when the oceans eat away
the continents and a shoreless sea rolls all
round the globe, death by universal thirst when
the seas sink into the inner caverns of the earth
and leave its surface desert—by suffocation
when the atmosphere is lost in space—by fire
and concussion when the solar system knocks
up against the star Algiatha and goes to
pieces—and by promiscuous upheaval when the
ice-weight at the poles sends the earth off its
balance. And, in addition to all these recog-
nised theories, there is still another fate in
prospect —death from universal dreariness and
lemonade and eold-tea, and from the melancholy
dark-brownness of all things, and from being
preached into insensibilty by wild Congrega-
tional women. This latter is evidently what
the world is going to die of. The other disasters
may all come along in turn, but they won’t
arrive in time to do any damage.
Working the Crimson Thread.
It is true that we are at the day of social
issues, but we have not passed the time when
questions of national import can be slighted
witli impunity. Therefore, it is well for Deino-
oui 'y, whilst setting itself squarely in front oi
social problems, to keep an open eye on the
wiles of politicians in matters of a. national
kind. There are abundant reasons for this.


We know full well, from experience, that there
are men in positions of trust in Australia who
are ready and even eager to barter the interests
of their country for the smiles of Imperialism,
and this should cause us to view with suspicion
any attempt made by our politicians to en-
tangle us in engagements, whether commercial
or political, with provinces of the empire beyond
the seas. This is peculiarly applicable to the
recent palavers with Canada in which the
‘ ‘ crimson thread” and the “silken bonds”
have been curiously entwined with matters of
business, which, if brought to an agreement,
would result in the maximum of gain and the
minimum of expense to Canada; but the mini-
mum of gain and the maximum of expense to
Australia. In some ways, at least, Canada has
her head screwed on fairly well. She sees very
clearly that, apart from all sentiment, there is
money in the Crimson Thread. It is a good
spec, for her, since by it she may, at the ex-
pense of Australia, transfer the trade between
this continent and America, from San Fran-
cisco to Vancouver, and, in addition to obtain-
ing control of the traffic now flowing through
the States, she may reasonably hope that a line
of steamers sufficiently endowed with Aus-
tralian subventions will be able to carry goods
at such rates as to vastly augment it. Thus, so
far, from a Canadian standpoint, the crimson
thread is a real good thing. It has enabled the
Canadians to get hold of £lO,OOO a year of our
money to put them in a position to undersell
the Americans in our markets and to in-
crease their importance at the expense of
the States, and now, working the thing
for all it is worth, they have partly
succeeded in inducing us to spend a vast
sum of money to invest them with a monopoly
of the telegraph business between .Europe and
Australia-—a monopoly, undoubtedly, because
its munificent endowments from the revenues
of Australia would not only allow it to defy
competition across the Pacific, but enable it to
render the Port Darwin line unpayable.
* • *
Apart from the commercial and political
advantages of having control of the communi-
cation between Australia and Great Britain,
the business between the Atlantic and Pacific,
carried over the Canadian wires, would render
these increasingly productive; just as the
carriage across the Canadian wastes of the
traffic brought to Vancouver by the steamers
we pay for will cause that once white elephant
of the Dominion—the Canadian-Pacific railway
—to grow and flourish like a green bay-tree, a
circumstance, no doubt, entirely satisfactory to
the Canadian Dominion. But where, beyond
paying for it, does Australia come in ? That is
a question asked in vain by Australians, when
bound by their politicians to pay £120,000 per
annum to keep a British squadron to protect
British merchant men, and to annually con-
tribute some thousands of pounds to support,
in the Imperial Institute, a toadying set of
schemers in plotting against our liberties.
Counting up all these tributes, with others
that might be mentioned, and it will be
tolerably apparent that the silken bonds form
bonds to our people in more senses than one,
and, this being the case, it is just about time
that the blue-nosed contrivers, and their co-
adjutors in Westminster, should be carefully
advised that wx appreciate their sentiments on
the silken bonds question at their full money-
value, and that there are many in Australia
who believe that the palavering and slobbering
over “The Empire” are influenced by self-
interest more than fraternity. To those of that
opinion it will also occur that the main-
tenance of Canada, apart from the United
States, is not a subject for hilarious con-
gratulation, but much rather the reverse.
* # #
If Canada were to complete the work
of Federation on the North American
continent by joining the great Union that
borders her on the south along a frontier
of over 3000 miles, she would be doing
infinitely more for the race we belong to than
by professing regard for distant and trans-
marine countries. The peace of the world, or
the peace of a whole continent, is of much more
importance in this stage of our history than the
aggrandisement of Great Britain or the ability
of the Empire to dictate to other Powers, and
if Canada were to join with the States the prin-
cipal means whereby Great Britain—-and, as
things are, Australia also —could be embroiled
with the United States would be removed,
i’his is what the Canadian-Pacific men, the
Ottawa Government people, the army and navy
men, the lovers of titles and haters of Demo-
cracy crowd, do not care to see. But they are
quite satisfied for Great Britain to pull their
chestnuts out of the fire on one side in case of
differences with the United States, and for
English-speaking people in all parts of the
world to be liable to be drawn into a war
with the American Union over some question of
fisheries or territorial rights, and they are not
at all disposed to abandon their present style of
Government as long as its continuance guaran-
tees them the expenditure on their coast and
their highways of a stream of Australian and
Imperial subventions. That being the state of
Canada on the European business, is it not time
for Australia, when the Empire palavering is
again on the board, to follow the Canadians in
playing for her own hand ? Then, if we do so,
the Blue-noses will learn, for the first time in
their history, that Australia has far more to
gain by close relations with the great and
wealthy American States than by any connec-
tion with the weak and snow-clad Dominion,
which revels in the tinsel of a mock-king
at Ottawa, and gushes over its “brethren”
when they are thousands of miles away whilst
snarling at its big brothers just over the border.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Government by “Stoush.”
Government by Contradiction we have always
with us, and government by minority is a
familiar thing, while government by bluff and
government by “ euchre ” are more than occa-
sional incidents in political history. And, as if
hese were not burden enough there has lately
been super-added in New South Wales a form of
authority more hideous than all the others, and
which may be labelled government by “ stoush.”
It had its origin in the braggart visit of a lot of
big-footed and heavy-fisted footballers who
went to “ assist ” Mr. M'Millan at one of his
meetings held near Darliughurst somewhere
about two years ago. The demonstration suc-
ceeded, and Mr. M‘Millan has never had a
good hearing in Sydney since, and has been
compelled to go away to a suburban con-
stituency because, as he alleges, he will
not be listened to in East Sydney. But
his meetings have not had a monopoly of
the “ stoush ” system. The Active Service
Brigade, and the pugilist “ push,” and the
Mosquito Club, and gentleman-larrikins of the
football persuasion have carried their assault
and battery campaign into every recent politi-
cal meeting, and the question whether a motion
or amendment will be carried depends now
upon the possession by either party of a con-
trolling force of fists. The police are not
counted on either side. They are present
simply to see what goes on: the work of
“chucking out” opponents and suppressing
hostile disorder is left to the bullies of the
respective parties. And the climax was reached
when, at the recent meeting of the Foreign-
trade party in Sydney Protestant Hall, Parkes
(chairman), and Messrs, Reid, Wise, Want,
and a host of other upholders of lawnorder,
looked on at the edifying sight of a notorious
pugilist with an objector’s head in chancery in
the front row of the gallery. At whose request
the bruiser punched heads on that occasion is
immaterial to the present question. He may
have. knocked his victims over for the mere
love of exercise, but the disgraceful fact
remains that the promoters of the meeting, by
permitting his continued ministrations, identi-
fied themselves with the policy of stoush. It
is weakly urged as an excuse that opposition
was anticipated, and that it was necessary to
meet violence with violence. The excuse
admits assault and battery to be a means of
political advocacy, and assumes that it is right
to use illegal violence to attain a political
object, which is bad law and worse reason-
ing. The fact is that the whole evil
has arisen out of the practice of allow-
ing bullies to do the work of the
police. An agreement to prevent a speaker
from being heard is a legal offence, and an
assault is no less a crime, because it is made
during the course of a public meeting. Years
ago the case of Lee v. Macpherson showed
that an assault in the Assembly was just as
clearly punishable in the police-court as an
assault committed in the street, and the police
have only to use their ordinary powers of arrest
in order to put a final stop to the evil that has
disgraced Sydney recently, and which threatens
to put every candidate at the next general
election at the mercy of the pugs, and
“ pushes.”
The Fraudulent Trustee Industry.
Last week a Sydney solicitor named Broad
received a sentence of five years’ imprisonment
—an altogether astonishing consummation in
the case of a “ Gentleman, One.” His offence
was an utterly heartless misappropriation of a
woman’s whole life’s savings, amounting to some
£2600, which sum had been entrusted to him
on the strength of his presumed respect-
ability as a solicitor and a gentleman
by Act of Parliament. Broad’s case is an
amazing exception to the hitherto almost in-
variable rule that a solicitor may steal anything
on the face of the earth with no worse conse-
quences than temporary or permanent suspen-
sion—which only means the necessity of starting
business again with the assistance of a qualified
dummy whose name appears on the official
door-plate. Also, as a further innovation,
Broad is required to refund £5OO of his steal,
while the ordinary suspended solicitor refunds
nothing at all. This new departure, how-
ever, is not to be regarded as a
precedent, and the next fraudulent solicitor, or
the next dozen fraudulent solicitors, will pro-
bably be suspended for a brief period and
allowed to retain the boodle in the good old
way. One of the most astonishing things on
record is the world’s simple faith in the common
or garden solicitor. The Australian legal prac-
titioner has bolted with the trust funds to
nearly every port on earth, and he has lain low
on nearly every Pacific isle waiting for the
storm to blow over, and he has been
suspended in every Supreme Court in the
seven Australasias, and the result, so far as his
clients are concerned, has been generally the
same—the money has never been recovered.
And to his stealings must be added those of the
banker, financier, and high-minded private
trustee, who have bolted with the widow’s
mite and the orphan’s humble crust by every
Valparaiso coal ship, and every tramp steamer,
and every South Sea trader that infests the
Pacific. As a general rule, the man who leaves
the fortune of his widow and orphans in the
care of any private trustee might as hopefully
leave them in the guardianship of the crocodile
at the Zoo. The Maoriland Government, recog-
nising this fact, has created a Public Trust
Office with the State as security for the honesty
of its guardianship. In Australia, owing to the
absence of such an institution, joint stock com-
panies are beginning to compete with that
private swindler, described—when he is found
out—as a “ Gentleman, One.” Melbourne has
now several of these institutions, and Sydney
has two the Permanent Trustee Co. of
New South Wales, and the Perpetual
Trustees. These companies act as executors,
trustees, administrators, agents for absentees,
etc., and perform all the other duties of the
private trustee. And, unlike the private
trustee, they can’t take the well-worn road to
the Pacific slope ; they never die or become
disabled by illness ; and if they ever defraud
the widow, their shareholders must make good
the loss out of capital. And seeing that the
solicitor, in very many cases, has no capital
except a brazen front, a reliable thirst, and a
yearning after the gold-washed female who
leadeth unto destruction, this advantage alone
is of inestimable value.
On behalf of Victorian charities interested in
the nullifying of Dr. Beaney’s “Canterbury
Bequest,” a queer application was made to
Chief Justice Madden last week. Poor, vain-
glorious Beaney bequeathed, as everybody
knows, £lO,OOO to his native city of Canter-
bury to found an institute that should bear his
name. Melbourne hospitals and other bodies
(being entitled to share “residue ” of Beaney’s
estate) disputed the legality of this Canterbury
gift, but Justice A’Beckett decided in favour
of the bequest. An appeal to the Full Court had
the usual legal result of upsetting the decision
previously given, and Beaney’s £lO,OOO was
ordered to remain in Victoria to swell the
residue aforesaid. Then, of course, the city of
Canterbury, considering itself put upon by Vic-
torian Judges, determined to take the matter to
the Privy Council. At present the case is
slowly making its way to that august tribunal,
but meanwhile Chief Justice Madden was
besought to strike out the reasons and explana-
tions which Justice A’Beckett had appended
in support of his judgment after the Full Court
had overruled it. This application was refused,
so the Privy Council will presently see why
Mr. A’Beckett differed from the other Judges.
One would have thought that there could be no
honourable cause for seeking to strike out the
A’Beckett opinions, inasmuch as they could
make no difference if they were bad opinions in
law. But the appealing counsel displayed
much anxiety to carry his point all the same.
Presumably, then, there is a danger of the
Privy Council overruling the Full Court which
overruled Justice A’Beckett, and saying some-
thing nasty on the matter. We shall see.
The San Francisco Examiner proposes to re-
organise the bi-cameral system of government
on an entirely new plan. Hitherto the system,
in most English-speaking countries, has been
to have one progressive Chamber and one
Chamber of Stagnation—one House whose mem-
bers try, in a feeble sort of way, to do some-
thing, and another which always prevents
them doing it. The scheme has been a dismal
failure. Therefore, it is suggested that there
shall be instead a sober Chamber and a drunk
one; or else only one Chamber, which will
periodically resolve itself into drunk com-
mittee, and while there either confirm or cancel
the things it did when in its sober condition.
The theory is that when the House is in
intoxicated session it will suffer from occasional
attacks of truthfulness—that the member who
is engineering a political railway through his
own estate will then announce, in the thick
utterance of honesty, that he doesn’t care a darn
for the country, or anything but his own private
swindle; that the man who is trying to negotiate
a land resumption spec, will rise and move
that the Government should buy his uninhabit-
able swamp at six times its value ; and that the
member who doesn’t give himself away will be
given away by some other member while he is
insensible under the seat. In short, the theory
is that when the House resolves itself into
drunk committee it will wreck all the little
schemes which it organised when sober, and
that ten members will speak at once, each busy
furnishing valuable information about the other
nine which will effectually block their re-
election and his own, and make Parliament all
the better for their absence. The scheme, if it
doesn’t end in murder, has some obvious
advantages. The one thing wanted to make it
complete is for the House to have a threefold
identity, and, in its third capacity, to resolve
itself periodically into bilious committee, in
which state it will finally review everything
which has passed the other two stages. If a
Legislature isn’t honest when it has a vast
amount of green fruit lying undigested on its
chest, then it never will be honest on this side
of the land that is paved with flames.
Attorney-General Barton, in answer to a
question in N.S.W. Assembly, said that the
convict Glasson, on the report of the visiting
surgeon, was exempted from wearing the usual
half-cwt, of fetters. But he added that gaol
regulation No. 36 provides that condemned
prisoners should be ironed, and “ no adequate
reason has been shown why the existing
practice should be discontinued.” Such an
answer is thoroughly in keeping with the hoary
traditions of Botany Bay. The object in iron-
ing a condemned prisoner is not to prevent his
escape, for he is no more likely to escape than
any other of the several dozen or several
hundred unfettered convicts Avho inhabit the
same gaol. And it is not to prevent him
dodging the gallows by suicide, for a leg-
ironed man can hang himself to the window
bars as well as one who is not ironed, and if a
prisoner really means suicide even half-a-ton of
rusty chains would not stop him. Moreover,
there is no logical reason why he shouldn’t
commit suicide if he wants to. Society only
desires to get rid of him, and if he saws his
head partly off in his cell it gets rid of him as
effectually as it could any other way. The
chains are only a formality—a remnant of red-
tape brutalism—a rusty incubus, left over from
the old convict days, and the Attorney-General
who can’t see why this ancient cruelty should
be abandoned is too obtuse for his century.
New South Wales badly wants a few statesmen
whose mental horizon is not bounded by the
narrow limits of gaol regulation No. 36.
That unspeakable tendency of New South
Wales Judges to be a law unto themselves
grows stronger every day. An instance is
reported from Young (N.S. W.). At that town
a woman, some little time ago, accused two
men of stealing from her the sum of £2 19s. Id.
The evidence for the prosecution was miserably
weak, and consisted largely in the fact that
the plaintiff swore to a B.N.S.W. £l-note
which was found in the possession of one of the
prisoners, as being her property, but as there
was no mark on the note to distinguish it from
any other note, and as all £l-notes issued by
the same bank are very much alike, this was
an interesting commentary on the great art of
identification rather than evidence. Then
the prisoners proved that they had drawn
certain amounts in wages, which were
sufficient to account for the money in their
possession, and the jury acquitted them.
Whereupon Judge Stephen remarked that he
approved of the verdict, and ordered that the
money found on the prisoners should he con-
fiscated and handed over to the prosecutrix. If
this order was lawful, it would seem that a
Judge can overrule the verdict of a jury—
which verdict is final—and compel a man to
hand over his own property to a prosecutor
from whom a jury has declared such property
was not taken by him.
The passing of the death sentence on Mrs.
Knorr, the Melbourne baby-murderess, was
attended by all the stereotyped gruesomeness.
The half-dying woman was brought to the court
to be exhibited to the crowd. She was “ stood”
up in the dock moaning piteously, and as she
presently collapsed she was supported on either
side by a warder. Then the weeping Judge
inserted himself in the specially-designed black
cap which makes the law, on such occasions,
look like an inky Punch ; and, in a voice
broken with emotion, and with the usual official
tear running down his visage, he delivered an
address to his practically insensible auditor,
and finished up with the customary sentence
and a slab of pious exhortation. Then the
prisoner, who had fainted, was carried away,
and the ceremony terminated. To all intents
and purposes the Judge might as well have read
a tract to a corpse, but, as usual, he had a lot
of undigested eloquence on his chest, and the
broken woman in the dock furnished an oppor-
tunity for getting rid of it. The eloquent Judge
and the weeping Judge are two varieties of
Judge that should be promptly removed from
the Bench. The eloquent Judge is an awful
specimen of bad taste, and the weeping one is a
mere affectation. The hangman doesn’t weep,
neither does the prosecuting counsel, nor the
warder who removes the condemned prisoner,
nor the arresting constable, nor the jury, nor
anybody else connected with the business ; and,
as tenderness is not confined solely to judges, it
can only be presumed that the weeping of these
latter is merely a matter of tradition. Also, it
is a decidedly objectionable tradition ; many a
prisoner has caught cold—which was no part of
his sentence—through being convicted before a
damp Judge, and has had his constitution
seriously undermined thereby; and as this is an
altogether unauthorised addition to the penalty
of the law, the moist variety of Bench is dis-
tinctly illegal, and the sentence passed by a
tearful court should be overset on appeal.
London Referee illustrates that vapoury thing
so sickeningly reiterated—-the “ British spirit
of fair play,” in these gentle observations con-
cerning the recent battue in Matabeleland
Imagine, finally, the coolness needed to meet the shock
of a deadly rush of black fiends, one-tenth of whose
numbers, if they succeeded in traversing the narrow zone
of fire, would be sufficient to massacre every white man
opposed to them. It is epic ! Nothing finer than this
Matabele campaign has been done under the English flag.
Probably not. The annals of “ the English
flag” are red with such episodes. A “zone of
fire ” that is certain death to the rudely-armed
Africans at half-a-mile distance, while the
white operator has only to turn a handle and
smoke a cheroot, is a pretty solid guarantee for
coolness. The writer is a tolerable coward,
but he would hurl defiance at the biggest whale
that ever smashed a boat or swallowed a Jonah
so long as he (the writer) was at safe Maxim
range from the water’s edge. “Epic!” So is
eating piecrust.
This was the rejoinder of Premier King-
ston to Stonewall Castine’s attack in the S.A.
Assembly, on the Federal Council and its pro-
ceedings : “If the reasonable deliberations,
occupying 20 hours and 5 minutes, of some of the
leading statesmen of Australasia are worth nothing
what is the value of hours of asiivne stone-
walling drivel by a second-rate local politician?”
One of Julius Vogel’s sons is in the em-
ploy of the Chartered Company of South Africa,
and is out with Rhodes’ little army against the
Matabele. He has not done much in the fighting
line, his contribution to the success of the war
being mainly in the shape of booming letters to
his father, who very considerately places them at
the disposal of the press. Good old advertiser
Jew-lius. Where there is borrowed money, and
land-grants, and concessions that require to be
floated, and gold-mines, and the three-ball shadow
is over the land, there will the Vogels be gathered
together.
The Countess of Rothes, a Scotch peeress,
who died the other day at the age of 83, hands
down a grand old mortgage to her descendants.
When the seventh Earl of Rothes died in 1681,
Charles 11., his companion of many drunks and
unprintable-festivities, ordered for him about the
grandest funeral ever seen in Great Britain. But
he never paid for it, and the bill came on the
family, whose estate was mortgaged almost to the
last square inch of dirt to raise the amount.
Since then twelve holders of the title have lived
on husks and other cheap refreshments in the
effort to settle up for that old-time burial, and
yet the family mortgage hasn’t been entirely lifted
even to this day.
The hand of the Lord, which a couple of
years back pressed heavily upon Shirley Baker,
the Premier of Tonga, has now let up a bit, and
news from Auckland states that the young King
has dismissed his Ministry and formed a new one.
The new Premier is Sabeki, a devoted adherent of
Baker, and a much abler man than the deposed
Tukuaho, who was a mere dullhead—a creature
of the missionary interest. Every other appoint-
ment has been given to Baker’s friends, and, as
whites and natives alike want him back, the
probability is that he will return, though nob
without a strenuous protest from the High Com-
missioner of the Western Pacific, who will be
backed up by the almost all-powerful Wesleyan
mission. But with all Baker’s faults, there is no
doubt that, as Premier, ho will be the strong man
of the Pacific Islands. Insensate vanity, born of
too much power, once proved his downfall, bub ha
is nob likely to err again in that direction.
Premier Kingston (S.A.) has decided to
“retrench” Sammy Deering, who has held in
London the rosy billet of Assistant Agent-General
for S.A., since 74. For 40 years, Deering has
lived and flourished on officialism, his last S.A.
appearances being as Lands Secretary and Crown
Law Secretary. Before that he was aide-de-camp
to two Governors—Dominick Daly and James
Fergusson, and several clerks in several depart-
ments. lie first struck South Australia in ’53,
and waded in to occupy Government billets almost
immediately. His present screw is .£750, but the
“perks” run to as much again. In ’9l-2, Deer-
ing acted as Agent-General while the late Arthur
Blyth was ill, and it was quite a shock to him,
after Blyth’s death, to find that little John Cox
Bray wanted to air his balloon-like form in
London as A.G., which billet was the goal of Sam
Deering’s ambition.

The first production—the first at Sydney
Lyceum, that is—of “Princess Ida,” on Saturday,
revealed that epigrammatic sylph in a more
radiant aspect than .of old. Miss Nellie Stewart
made a much more artistic and melodious Princess
than Leonora Braham did six operatic years
agone. Miss Stewart was in bright voice for the
music that came her way—the Invocation to
Minerva was quite grand-opera iah ; likewise, she
deserved much praise and many flowers for her
share of the pessimistic but pretty quartette,
“The World is but a Broken Toy,” arid the
natural, unforced feeling she put into “I Built
Upon a Rock.” Also, the large audience
applauded Miss Stewart for the well-delivered
stump-speech in her first entrance. Elsie
Cameron, whose re-appearance is welcome as
flowers in May, played and sang Lady Blanche in
a calm, absorbed sort of way that made that
ambitious schemer a very real character; and
Florence Young, as Psyche, the girl with the
slightly “ blue ” song about Darwinian man, and
gentle May Pollard, as Melissa, did all they could
in thoir little parts.
* * *
The dependable Henry Bracy, as Hilarion,
was in fresh, articulate voice, and played the love-
lorn youth without a trace of the stage-manager.
His “ Appeal,” in the last act, was very wheed-
ingly done. Lauri was King Gama, got-np like
Richard Crookback, and talking like Albert
Norman when he wears a shiny iiat and swears
that a time will come. His Gama makes one
think that Lauri only keeps out of the sort of play
where the hero strikes a subtle attitude and dis-
sembles before his minions, not for want of natural
aptitude for that sort of thing, but because there’s
no money in it. Ryley, as Florian, made his
greatest hit when he tried to put his gown on
over his feet, but his futile struggles with
that garment rather spoilt the lively “Every
Maid” trio. Rosevear was in Woodfield’s old part
of “Cyril.” The difference was brought home to
you most keenly in the tipsy “Kiss Song.”
Woodfieid’s stage-intoxication insinuated that he
had got foggy on gold-top fizz in Venetian glasses
—Rosevear suggested rather a common colonial
beer obfuscation discovered in a pewter pot.
Howard Vernon did the best anybody could do
with Hildebrand; and Grundy, as the principal
warrior, dressed in sardine-tins, will improve with
practice. Also, the chorus made as little of a hot
night as the locusts do. “ Princess Ida ” ends the
conrio opera season in Sydney for the present, and
on Boxing Night the pantomime, “Beauty and
the Beast,” commences to glitter with Nellie
Stewart as Beauty, and Bartho heading the
bounding brigade.
** * *
Maggie Moore quitted Sydney Royal a few
days ago and departed for Melbourne, there to be
principal boy in a pantomime. The balance of
the company filled in the last ten days or so of the
season with “Queen's Evidence”—an eminently
respectable drama which no person could seriously
object to. Still there is a lack of novelty about
“ Queen’s Evidence ” these times. The joy faded
out of it some years ago, and now it seems reminis-
cent of nothing in particular save the modern
realistic novel—the one which opens with a dull,
stout woman in a brown dress sitting down beside
a table on a wet day, while a lame girl with hair
of no particular colour looks out of the window.
Still, regarded as a stop-gap, the drama served as
well as any other to wind up tiie season, and then
the company went its way like the ten lepers
alluded to in Holy Writ. The Royal is closed this
week while, the new lessees, Messrs. Gourlay and
Walton, are struggling with vast preparations for
the forthcoming pantomime. “Babes in the
Wood ” opens on Saturday (23rd) amid a blaze of
Oriental gorgeousness.
** « *
Her Majesty s (Sydney) is also closed
while the stupendous pantomime of “Jack the
Giant-killer ”is in preparation. It is generally
understood that this effort will makean astonished
earth sit up, and will break all past records. The
Criterion, after a long period of desolation, re-
opens on Boxing-Night with Thornton and
Arnold’s company in “ Charley’s Aunt.” Various
small shows of more or less note also propose to
take advantage of the season, and sundry houses
which have been almost forgotten of late will
make a fitful re-opening, like the unexpected
appearance of a ghost from the dank, oppressive
tomb.
*» * *
Melb. shows have accomplished nothing
novel during the past fortnight, and just now the
theatres are mostly closed for Boxing-Night pre-
parations, whilst their patrons track the fatted
goose to its lair. Thirteen farewell performances
of the clever Italian Company terminate to-night
(Thursday) with “Faust.” At 11 p.m., or there-
abouts, Giraud will sink through the floor of the
Princesses’ in the grip of our old friend Buzzi,
after which Del Torre will join the angels as
per stage directions, and the curtain will descend
upon a notable operatic season. “Pagliacci ” and
“ Oavalleria ” made a fairly successful double-bill,
the former being played by the original cast, ex-
cepting only the natty little figure of Signorina
Mettler in place of Del Torre. For acting pur-
poses the blonde lady was quite equal to her pre-
decessor, and an occasional paring down of
the music, to bring it within her compass
made little difference in the general effect.
“Cavalleria” was knocked about a good
deal on the nights when Giraud couldn't under-
take the tenor part in both operas. Sometimes
Fnisca gave a shrill, serio-oomio rendering of the
giddy soldier. On one occasion only plump,
cherubic Charles Saunders, the concert singer,
.appeared as a Turiddu who had to be shaken
violently by the prima-donna to make him seem
anxious to avoid her importunities. Saunders
proved unequal to the heartless conduct required
of him, which, in any case, would have been quite
out of keeping with his adipose tissue and happy
smile. Also, nervousness crippled his light tenor
voice, albeit he sang many bits like a genuine
artist. The tall, nnelastio baritone, with the
slender legs, was an indifferent substitute for
Caruson, as the teamster, and so, one way and
another, “Cavelleria ’’lost caste in its latter days.
On Saturday, the pastoral narrative of “L’Arnico
Fritz ” was warbled with much narcotic success.
*« « »
The Princess's pantomime is “ Little Red
Riding Hood ” —not that the title has much bear-
ing on the subject—and for this grand annual out-
break the Firm has secured the usual “host of
attractions.” Courtneidge, Jennie Lee and
Violet Varley are engaged to lead the riot. The
name of Greville appears. Mesdames Ethel
Haydon, Rosie Nott and Maie Saqui have con-
sented to take part in the fell deed. D’Argo and
Mary Weir come in as pearls of the ballet, and a
foreign gentleman who gambols on the slack wire
is especially recommended to notice by his huge
salary. This gifted stranger is said to be the
highest paid artist —next to Divine Sara —who
has ever visited Australia on business.

Maggie Moore is to play Sinbad at fch e
Royal, in a broad, untrammelled panto, which als°
includes “Jack Horner.” The Royal company
reads quite strong enough to bring grist to the old
mill. Tretty Bella t’ennan, Martin Hagan, and
a number of “variety” people are down on the
bill, together with Miss Isabel Webster and
Leumane, who will certainly give a good musical
tone to the venture. John Wallace is a guarantee
for capable stage-management.
** * *
“ Charley’s Aunt” flourishes until Friday
night at the Bijou, and then journeys along to
Sydney. On Boxing Night the Seraphina Opera
Co., under David Cope’s management, will re-open
this theatre and struggle to keep its gates ajar.
** * *
Dan Barry, with Ms dramatic tribe from
the interior, will occupy the poor old Alexandra
on Saturday (23rd). Their pioneer show is to be
“Ransom,” a play illustrating bygone bushrang-
ing days, whilst the advertised prices are strictly
adapted to modern requirements.

The Beaumonts, who live, move, and have
their being in a glass-case with water in it (but
are infinitely more diverting than goldfish or
aqnarflim exhibits), form a chief attraction at
Melb. Alhambra. Also, Slade Murray is a recent
arrival here, and Xmas prospects are pretty
bright. The Gaiety rubs along as usual, and
somebody possessing the courage of his opinions
intends to re-open St. George’s Hall on Boxing
Night.
** * #
Melb. Exhibition, a building notoriously
addicted to Xmas “ revels ” and profuse celebra-
tion of the season in its sacred or festive aspects,
intends to be very busy this year. W. J. Turner
has arranged a series of large shilling entertain-
ments, ranging from oratorio and views of
Palestine down to funny clowns and skirt-
daneing. As for the vocal artists attached to this
undertaking, they are grave or gay with equal
impartiality. It is not unusual for a gentleman
to sing “Nazareth’’one day, and impersonate the
Devil 24 hours later.

Dear Bulletin, “ Immomeena,” tho
operatic production of two Adelaide (H.A.) men,
has been most favourably criticised —in Adelaide.
Which is why the comments are worthless. This
so-called comic opera is only tit for suburban pro-
duction by (say) a University Musical Society. I
don’t think, outside of Adelaide, it would run for
two nights; probably there’d be an impromptu
massacre at the opening chorus. Curtain rises on
a meeting of some 15 station-hands, in scarlet
shirts, corduroys, and top-boots, with the girls
attached to the station. On the opening-
night, these queerly-dressed “bushies” were
entrusted with stockwhips to handle, but got
them so tangled up that they had to be taken
away. To hear “Coo-ee!” sung and repeated
echo-wise, gave an Australian the hump. The
dialogue is vapid and even vulgar. The grazier tells
the girls to go in for “ unsweetened gin!” A
song of “Australia,” under flying banner d la
“ Pirate King,” and with a “Rouse ye, Gawler ”(!)
chorus, maddens a native to want to burn Aus-
tralia in effigy. Plot? Ahem :—Alderman Mayne
reaches the station in search of an erring son,
being accompanied by a scientist in search
of a bMyip and other curios. A spieler
namesake is foisted on the alderman’s cre-
dulity for a while, but, by and bye, the
real prodigal, Trooper Fergus, is hugged to his
dad's bosom and enabled to marry Kitty Crosby.
The love-passages are as sheepish as some in real
life. The music is reminiscent—Sullivanesque;
in some places, diluted “ Mikado; ” redeemed in
other places with melodious duets and a first-class
gavotte. But the dialogue ! Great Congreve 1
Tiie scientist rushes on and off, speaking patter
songs, chasing the bunyip, taking long pulls out
of a black bottle, and generally stupefying the
audience, till the bunyip is captured. And this
is the climax of the button-bursting comic opera—
the hauling on to the stage, by means of a
hawker, a rope, a cord, a string—of a small pug-
dog. A wheeze as old as original sin.—Yours,
&c. C.P.H.

A correspondent forwards a long and
abusive letter on many subjects, and winds up by
objecting to The Bulletin’s favourable notice of
% recent production at a certain Sydney theatre,
which, he says, could only be owing to the paper's
representative being “squared.” He also asserts
that dramatic critics usually are “ squared.” The
Bulletin can only say, in reply, that it believes
the average Australian dramatic critic to be
strictly honest —so far as it knows, he never gets a
chance to be otherwise. The writer lias attended
all manner of shows for over six years, and in
all that time ho only hud one opportunity to
forget tho dignity of his position, and that was
when the father of a fat girl took him aside, and,
in a smothered voice, offered him 10s. He also, as
a further attempt at corruption, made the fat girl
take off her boots and stockings and exhibit two of
tiie largest feet in Christendom. Apart from this
solitary incident he has always been strictly disin-
terested because he had to, and ho presumes that
Hither critics have met with a similar experience.
The press doesn’t get a decent chance to be cor-
rupt these times. The beastly integrity of
theatrical managers is against it.

The penny Argus lately spoke of “ Helen Terry and
Mrs. Langtree.” We’ll be hearing next of J. C. Wilkinson

Prank Thornton’s proper name is Tubbs. 110 has a

Maude Hobson, who plays the name-part in “ A Gaiety
Girl,” at the Prince of W ales, London, is alleged to be a
native of St Kilda (Melb.) She first appeared at the
Gaiety in the time of the “Happy Family’’—Nellie
Farren, Kate Vaughan, Edward Terry, and Teddy Royce
—as an “ extra lady.” Twelve months later, she married
Captain W. B. Hayley, of the 11th Hussars, and after-
wards lived over the years in the Sandwich Islands, where
her husband was Vice-Chamherlain to King Kalakaua,
and she a lady-in-waiting to the Queen. She is decidedly
handsome, but the critics say ugly things about her
singing.
According to English files, Messrs. Lestocq and Lincoln
have constructed an Australian drama, entitled “The
Bush King.” It was to have been produced at the Surrey
early in November. Lestocq’s partner is Mr. Willie
Lincoln, son of the senior partner in Lincoln, Stuart &
Co., the big Melbourne cheap-clothing firm. He is a
mild-looking youth, and has a harmless ambition to be a
dramatist. Before leaving Melbourne with his port-
manteau full of MSS., he got about three of his pieces
produced at girls’ schools and amateur charity shows
without any fatal results.
Gilbert and Sullivan’s newest prima donna is named

The mild and persuasive Snazelle is in South Africa. At
latest advices a Johannesburg reporter had failed to boom

British way about him which is very charming.

A travelling company was playing “The Merchant of
Venice ” recently in a Maonland country town. The
show went well enough until it readied that place where
Portia tells Antonio to bare his bosom for the knife.
Then a voice from tiie gallery interposed in a few brief
words: “Garni E cant. Don’t yer see his shirt
buttons down the back ? ” The curtain went down after
that, and the last that was seen of the company was
Shylook shaking a convulsive dinner knife at the audience.

Prank Thornton tried to engage Myra Kemble to create

Bland Holt advertised his big drama, “ A Million of
Money,” round Maoriland by dropping purses full of
bogus sovereigns about the street. He generally dropped
the purse near to a respectable-looking man of pious
exterior. Then the respectable - looking man would
promptly put his foot on it, stoop down and meditatively
scratch the calf of his leg, and at last gently pick up the
plunder and glide down a bye-street. Then there would
be a sound of unprintable language down that bye-street,
anil Bland would go on his way in peace.
Lonnen has written a new and awful song. The follow-

Rumpty tumpty, nimpiy lumpty,

To all the fair it's “ Hulloh there,”
And give tiie girls a chance.

And mash ’em in between.

That s the sort L mean.
R. S. Smythe’s very first venture as an impressario or
theatrical agent was with the Bianchi’s opera company,
now, perhaps, almost forgotten in tiie lapse of time. The
" Much-Travelled ” abandoned parliamentary work in
Adelaide for what has proved a much more lucrative
occupation. The Biahchis are still in the flesh—the
Signora especially being in a very large quantity of it—
in San Francisco, where they are teachers of music.
Charlie Harding has been doing turns at the London

Penley was fairly “ had ” over the sale of tiie Australian
rights of “Charley’s Aunt.” He had vowed that he
would not Sell on any terms to Frank Thornton, who, on
his part, was equally determined to get the piece. Time
after time Frank nnavailingly tried to negotiate. At last,
it was arranged between Thornton and Charles Arnold'
that the latter should buy, if possible, and that Thornton
should then have tho play and join with Arnold and
“ Hans the Boatman ” in an Australian tour. The scheme
was successful; Penley parted with the Australian rights,
and his hated rival got tho play after all.
A London writer says that Antoinette Sterling’s
“serious viewyness ” is the chief factor in her success.
“ Serious viewyness ” expresses the hoarse old lady very
well.
On a house in High-street, Coventry (Eng.), appears a
sign; “ Tho Birthplace of Ellen Terry.” On the house
opposite is another sign : “This is the original birthplace
of Ellen Terry, this and no other.” Ellen herself can’t
remember which house she was born in, so the matter
remains unsettled.
Augustus Titheradge, son of George Titheradge, the well-
known actor, died of consumption a few days ago at
Blaakheath (N.S. W.). He was aged 20 years.
Harry Power, well-known in Australia, is touring the
English provinces in Hubert O’Grady’s company.
Gilbert, the opera man, had a friend who used to walk
his horse up and down Rotten Row every day—he never
trotted or cantered for fear of falling off. The author of
“Pinafore” admonished him about this one day. “If
you don’t take care you’ll he arrested one of these times
assure as fate.” “ Arrested 1 What for?” “Why, for
furious loitering, to be sure 1”
Sara Bernhardt was at Rio Janeiro during the bombard-

“Jack, the Giant-killer,’’ the Xmas pantomime at

Mrs. Kendal complains bil terly about a Yankee inter-
viewer whom she describes as “going about in only his
undershirt,” who calls her “ Madge ” in print and says
that she is a humbug. The familiarities of this undressed
man have aggravated her badly. “ff I were a humbug,”
she says, “ there are plenty of people in New York who
would know it. There are as many English actors here
as there are American actors in London. They know
whether I am a humbug, my hair dy ed, my cheeks
painted, my voice strident. ’
That hairy individual, Professor Richard, who fills him-
self up with electricity, and thunder blasts the lame
and the blind, is now agitating Chatters Towers (Q).
In the local papers the Professor quotes the critic of the
S.M. Herald in one of his performances ; “ In ten minutes
the patient (a blind man) was able to state that the Pro-
fessor’s shirt-calf was white and his coat-sleeve black ! ”
Probably he was also able to state that the sky was blue
as a further evidence of recovery.
Sydney Waxworks is tolerably impartial in its selection
of distinguished public characters. In the window, a
life-sized Holy Family ; on the adjacent door-post, a list of
“ choice assorted ” murderers. The Social Purity people,
by the way, would be vastly edilied to observe how the
public’s interest in the sacred group coils itself lovingly
round a lusty young adoring shepherd “mid nodings on.”

, A certain tragedian at present in Adelaide adver-
tises himself as follows: After the performance is over
he stalks up to one of the newspaper others along
with the local fire-brigadesuperintendent—who is a chum
and proceeds to give an alarm to the firemen at the
station. Then he drags out his watch, and as a few
loafers and belated citizens lounge about and the fire-
engine dashes up he announces in an awful voice, “Two
minutes and a-quarter.” After which a dwarf-headed and
large-eared reporter works off a foolish paragraph in
favour of tiie tragedian.
At latest advices, a beauteous Gaiety creature, who used

Aim£e Moore—the Melbourne ex-lady-journalist—
whose Juliet has evoked various comments, writes to Tub
Bulletin to point out that the recent Wallace benefit
was “ tiie only occasion on which I have appeared as
Juliet, tho’ several young men to whose Romeos I have
refused to play ” (names?) “now hate me accordingly.”
But Miss Moore should lay the flattering unction to her
soul that it is far more complimentary to have an aspiring
Romeo hate you because you won't play Juliet with him,
than scorn you afterwards because you will.
Harmston, the circus man, died at Singapore last
month.
London is suffering from bad times, but Paderewski has
scooped £lO5O (less expenses) from a simple pianoforte
recital at St. James’ Hall. This is said to be the record
for a one-man show.
Amateur theatrical clubs complain without reason that
W. and M. charge them a fee of £3 or £5 for the right to
give one performance of any of the firm’s operas. The
real truth is that W. and M. would prefer amateur per-
formances to be restricted to operas in which they have
no interest. They don’t care for selling their sanction
for a “fiver ” in most cases.
Sara Bernhardt says she has received over £250,000 for
her exertions oh the stage during the last 25 years’.
Richard Stewart, senr., commenced life as a tailor, then
became a ship’s carpenter, ran away from his ship in
Port Jackson, and took to tiie stage. His wife is the
mother of the Australian stage. She arrived in Hobart
Town in 1842 as Mrs. Stirling. In 1844, in Sydney, she
married her second husband, an excellent violinist
named Guerin, who was the father of Mrs. Harwood and
Miss Nellie Stewart.
Arthur Garner, like the late Henry Edwards, is an

French dramatists scarcely dare satirise the clergy—

Lowers is (he best Melb. amateur. His Gaspard in
“ Les Cloches de Corneville,” could hardly be excelled in
Australia. Lewers won his spurs as the Latin miser in
“ Aulularia,” with his college, and can give a splendid

Once when Duncan Macalhim’s co. was playing
“Daughter of the Regiment” in the Jap. theatre at
Tokio—as part of a big show that started at 2 p.m. and
ended at 2 a.m.—the theatre-manager informed Mac that
tile piece was too slow because it had no dancing in it.
Tiie co. had no ballet, so the obliging Duncan donned a
Rob Roy dress, borrowed a sporran, dirk, skene-dhu, etc.
from a Yokohama Scotch merchant, and, in the middle of
the opera, bounded on tiie stage with a “Hooch!” and
danced the Highland fling 1 It brought down the house

An English baritone is making a small fortune with a
song called “Tho man who broke the bookmaker who
broke the jockey who broke the girl who- broke the man
who broke the bank at Monte Carlo." The singer was

The hardest thing for an actor to do is to eat naturally
on the stage. Nobody looks really graceful when he is
sating—in fact, it is a question whether every human
being ought not to have his meals in absolute solitude—
and when he knows that several hundred people are
watching him the result is dreadful. Not one aelor in a
thousand can make any impression on his food under
these circumstances ; the result is about the same as if he
opened and closed a book on a piece of meat. Moreover
he feels bound to converse with hit month full to show
that he is quite at his ease. Titheradge has this complaint
badly, and at the stage-banquet he talks with his mouth
fuller than any other actor of The Bulletin’s acquaint-
ance.

Madame Belle Cole is coming to Australia. A Melbourne

“Belle is an immeasurably finer artiste than Antoinette
Sterling, although she may not have the natural voice of
that wild, prancing singer and she-buffalo from the
plains. She is, like most contraltos, preposterously
obese. When she walks on to the platform she wobbles
all over. And, what is more peculiar, one of her favourite
songs is a selection from one of the Italian operas, com-
mencing ‘O Fatima!’ If anyone else sang a song con-
taining the word ‘ fat ’ in her presence you would call it
grossly personal. But, though she is a strong woman’s
suffragist, Belle Cole is to be relied upon not to make
herself ridiculous as Sterling did, careering round, shriek-
ing and getting delirious.”

There is still some vague and shadowy talk of
criminally prosecuting the Freehold Investment Co.
(Melb.) directors. Of all the “boom” specs, this was
legally the most impudent, and the only person who has
ever appeared shocked by the suggestion of crime in the
matter is Henry Gyles Turner, a liquidator with singularly
liberal ideas on financial management. Just now the
name of James Balfour is before the Court in connection
with a compromise offered by that holy gentleman
towards squaring an action for the recovery of certain
dividends “alleged to have been wrongfully declared ”
by the Freehold Investment directorate. The old
“ Balfour, Elliott & Co." scandal is also erupting again in
a somewhat angry manner, so there is still some hope
that the history of various gigantic advances made to
that unsatisfactory firm (Elliott is Balfour’s son-in-law)
may be given to an ignorant world.
• • • • •
The story of one of these advances, from the
standpoint of one or two aggravated investors, was
poured, the other day, into the capacious ear of the
Court, Messrs. Balfour, M. H. Davies, J. M. Davies, and
Moodie, according to this tale, were shareholders in the
firm of Balfour, Elliott & Co., and were also large share-
holders in the Freehold Co., of which some of them were
directors. In their capacity as Balfour, Elliott and Co.
they, it is alleged, were interested in some land at Elstern-
wick, said land having been bought for ±‘25,000. Then,
when it boomed to a paper value of, perhaps, £70,000, the
Freehold Co., which was partly them, lent to themselves,
as Balfour, Elliott and Co., some £59,000 on the security
of this same land, and they were thus enabled to declare
a dividend in their capacity as Balfour, Elliott and Co.—
of ±6500 each. The loan was never repaid, and the
interest, at 9 per cent., remains outstanding to
tiiis day. Nevertheless, the interest due and unpaid
by themselves in one capacity was allowed by
them in their other capacity to appear in the
accounts of the Freehold Co. as profits realised,
and on the strength of it, among other things, the Free-
hold Co. paid a dividend in which the same financiers had
a share. Therefore, they had one dividend because they
had borrowed a large sum of money, and another partly
because they owed the interest on the said amount. Now
the “ security ” is valued at something like £7000; the
Freehold Co. is gone bung with total liabilities of
±1,500,000; most of the financiers involved are under-
stood to be practically ruined ; and the one, Balfour, who
still keeps his honoured head above water, offers ±5OOO,
payable by ten yearly instalments, without interest, in
satisfaction of all claims ; and there is much ground and
lofty cuss-language among depositors and others.
The above transaction is merely quoted as one
of the financial methods which led to the strange
doubling-up of the once great Freehold Investment Co.
The transactions on which it is proposed to base a criminal
prosecution are still dark and horrid mysteries, and con-
cerning them no particulars are yet available.

Premier Patterson has at last decided upon
Importing an American expert to manage the Victorian
railways. “ And yet,” says a Melbourne paper, “ there
is hardly a single railway in the United States which has
been administered with sufficient ability to keep it from
insolvency.” East year the railway experts of the U.S.
produced an average profit of a little over per cent.
If anything save experience could burst up the_ Austra-

of £113,699. The interest on investments for the past
year covered ail death claims and left £BOOO over, and the
institution which can show such a result as this is in a
decidedly enviable situation. The expenses of manage-
ment are a trifle under 19 per cent, of the total income—a
very low' proportion considering the intense competition
existing nowadays. The National Mutual has been 24
years in existence, and it has a good record of steady pro-
gress. It ranks a good second among purely Ansi ralian
offices—the gigantic A.M.P., of course, holding first place
—and seems likely to keep up its position.

The Land Corporation of West Australia has
declared a dividend, in London, of 27f per cent. It is a
little thing like this which shows the blessings of foreign
capital at tiieir best. The Land Corporation of VV.A.
has employed no labour W'orth speaking of, it hasn't
irrigated any of the Westralian deserts, it has grown
nothing, it has neither ploughed nor fenced nor dene
anything at all except make land dear for the genuine
settler. In four years, at the present rate of progress,
VV.A. will have more than paid back, in dividends, all the
foreign capital it ever got from the corporation —for a
great deal of its money never readied Australia at all—
and will still owe the whole amount all the same. In 20
years it will have paid it hack five times over, and will
still owe it and have to keep on paying it. And it will
keep on paying it over and over again and still owing it
to all eternity, unless it buys out the corporation some
day by paying it, in a lump, about eight times the money
it first invested, and thus gets rid of the inculms. There
is no Old Man of the Sea who sticks so close as the curse of
foreign capital.

The sudden prorogation of N.S.W. Parliament
left the Bank Notes Bill unfinished, and its future
prospects are uncertain. It was lost by one of those
small and foolish blunders characteristic of the men who
throw Acts of Parliament together in N.S.W. The Bill
passed the Assembly, but in the Council it was discovered
that the Bank of N.Q. had been omitted from the list of
note-issuing institutions. The missing name was in-
serted, but before the verbal amendment could be agreed
to by the Assembly Parliament closed up. It is now alleged
that confidence hasn’t been restored so much as was
commonly supposed, and that for want of fhe expected
legislative assistance it may be found advisable to renew
the expired legal tender proclamation. Also, there are
ugly rumours to the effect that one reconstructed bank
is'past saving, by any legislative process which can be
invented, and when it goes the smash will be something
unprecedented in its completeness.

The Equitable Building Society of Brisbane

No. 87,203. The said individual, it is alleged, only bought
his ticket on Friday last, and three days later affluence
fell upon him with a thud. Tims it is again demonstrated
that the last shall be first, and the first last. The Equit-

which is run to some extent by the same people, has an
honourable ambition to go and do likewise.

The old, old project for the conversion of the
Vic. debt into 3 per cent, interminable stock, is again to
the fore, and ttie Govt., it is seriously alleged, is inclined
to make the experiment. The theory of the project is this:
Victoria, like the rest of the Australias, lias a big debt
(£48,000,000), made up of a vast number of fragmentary
loans and debentures and stray issues of Treasury bills, at
various rates of interest. They keep failing due, and
they always fall due at awkward times. They are per-
petually being renewed under difficulties, and when the
province has to renew an old Joan every year it can’t
gel a decent chance to float a new loan. Therefore,
it is suggested that Victoria should convert its debt
into permanent 3 per cent, stock issued at 75—in
other words, that tin debt of £48,000,000 at 4 per cent.,
which is constantly falling due, should be exchanged f >r
a debt of £64,000,000 at 3 par cent., which will give no
trouble beyond payment of interest.
It is interesting to know that some British
financial authorities approve of this unspeakable project.
The great advantage claimed for it is that it will make
the interest no heavier—in fact, the interest will remain
exactly where it was before. But, seeing that it won’t
make it any lighter, it is difficult to understand where
the advantage comes in. If Victoria is never going to
pay off its debt, then the amount of it doesn’t matter, and
it is quite as easy for the province to owe £200,000,000 at
1 per cent, as £50,000,000 at 4 per cent. But if Victoria
does mean to pay off its debt some day or other, then it
will lose exactly £16,000,000. And the only equivalent
for this awful loss is the fact that the interest is to remain
just as it was before. Seeing that the interest is remain-
ing just as before, in any case, the benefit isn’t especially
conspicuous.
• • • * *
The bait is the opportunity for bragging forever
afterwards about the credit of the “kawliny.” Britain
borrowed for many years at 3 per cent., and was fearfully
and wonderfully bumptious over the fact that she could
get money at a lower rate than any other nation on earth.
The boast sounded well and cost just about £220,000,000.
Many of the British loans were floated at about 50, so that
if the country had paid 6 per cent, and borrowed at par,
the annual burden would have been just the same, and
the principal, which is now being repaid, would have been
£220,000,000 less. That great statesman, the bottomless
Pitt,’fooled away this stupendous amount for the mere
joy of being able to assert that England could get money
at so low a rate, and it is now suggested that Victoria
should fool away £16.000,000 for practically the same
reason. The fact that some eminent financial authorities
in Bull-land approve of the scheme is fully accounted for,
by the fact that Bull would get the £10,000,090. That
tenth-rate mediocrity, Treasurer Carter, is aiso believed
to favour the awful' project, which, considering the in-
herent dullness of the man, is not surprising.
The one absolute certainty of the case is that
the loan will have to be redeemed practically at par. No
country, when it begins to redeem its bonds, gets a chance
to buy’ them in the open market at any serious discount.
When a nation borrows, the fact that it wants money
makes its credit bad, and it borrows on unfavourable
terms; when it begins to pay off its debts, the fact t hat
it doesn’t want money makes its credit good, and its
bonds go up, and it buys them hack on unfavourable
terms also. The terms are always more or less unfavour-
able either way.

which started with a capital of £5OO reaching a market-
value of ..150,000. Even at the present rates the market-
value is over £BO,OOO, and the original shares have a pre-

Three of the Melbourne distressed unemployed
last week dropped on an 86oz. nugget at Wedderhurn.
Within a few hours some hundreds of fanners and
diggers were on rite ground ; claims were pegged off, and
a big effort made to jump the spot where the nugget was
found. When is Greer's army of over 2000 state-aided
fossiokers going to find a nugget weighing, say, one oz. ?
A report reached Sydney last week that two of them had
found something, but it “licked confirmation."
# # #
Victory, Charters Towers, last six months,
turned out 18,9900z5. for a profit in diva, of £50,000. The
half-yearly report ednf sses to the very abrupt falling off
in the yield from the No. 2 shaft. The co. has also paid
£4OOO for a complete second-hand 15-head plant to do its
own crushing. Quite enough, too. How many N.S.W,
second-hand plants would £4OOO not buy?
* * #
What sort of a dam have they at Mt. Allen ?
A few weeks back it was reported in Sydney that.it was
full ; now a wire is published, “ Water might last another
week.” Surely a mine where CSXoz. of amalgam is lifted
from the plates after two or three weeks crushing, should
lie made less dep ndent on water. Why not crush dry as
is done in all arid districts; particularly where the gold
is fine and the ore dry as at Mount Allen'?
* # *
In cutting a plat in the Mt. Lyell mine last
week, 70 tons of ore were taken out, containing nearly
100,000 oz. of silver, and valued at £14.000. Yet the pros-
pect failed to float in the badly-scared city of London.
* # *
The Mt. Gaban monthly divs. have changed
into a call. Pambula correspondents are discreetly silent.
Only the poor public remember the phrases—“As soon
as the plant is completed divs. will be resumed “There
is an enormous quantity of ore ready to take out.”
Better be without a plant than work one on calls.
* * m
Mini and party, of the Oakey Creek mine,
N.S.W., have had their Xmas crushing—lBo tons, 310 oz.
It is simply wonderful how this boat-shaped, narrow shoot
of gold quartz continues to go down. A little more than
a year ago this mine was sold for a song, under peculiar
circumstances. Since then the buyers, four hard-working
miners, have each netted some thousands. They have
also acquired the adjoining block, in which the shoot is
now being worked.
* * #
Omeo is another Vic. mining field on the mend.
The Good Friday mine recently crushed 100 tons for
2100 z., and several others are looking better. Bright,
too, is looking brighter than for many years. The old
Peabody mine has gone into the hands of an English co.,
and there are in many directions signs of a mining revival.
Victoria, generally, is working her mines for all they are
worth.
* # «
S.M. Herald, from Cootamundra (N.S.W.) :
“ The manganese deposits of this district will now be
worked,- and when tire field is opened up there will be
room for thousands of men.” And he might quite as
reasonably have said there would be room for millions
when lie was at it.

Queen Constance, apparently the boss mine of
Mareeba (Queensland): 700 ton, Co9oz. ; div., Cd. Another

AN N.S.W. ELECTORAL NIGHTMARE.
“Jack” Rider, who died lately in Mel-
bourne, where he was a pressman for a quarter of
a century, was Hansard reporter in Fiji Parlia-
ment when J. S. Butters, of Melbourne, was
Speaker, under the pre-British system. Rider
was once found guilty of “breach of privilege’’
and locked-up in the “coal hole” for a period.
He used to tell yarns about the luxurious life he
led in gaol, and how sorry he was when the
session came to an end and he was released. Poor
Rider has been dying of dropsy for years, and at
last finished up in Melb. Hospital.
Admiral de Mello, the would-be Brazilian
king-maker, has a malodorous reputation. Dom
Pedro trusted him, and he joined the conspiracy
against that good old potentate, not from Republi-
can sentiment, but for the sake of hard cash. He
conspired against President Fonseca, and helped
to overturn that aged warrior. He conspired next
against Peixoto, and proclaimed young Pedro as
emperor. Now he announces that he has no
desire to abolish the Republic, so apparently he has
betrayed his own baby monarch also. At latest
advices he had escaped with difficulty from Rio
Janeiro with his fleet, and the Republican
squadron is after him, looking for his head.
That historic politician,
Vincent Pyke, returns to
Maoriland Parliament in his
66th year. He was a store-
keeper on a Victorian gold-
field in the old, gaudy,
riotous, hard-drinking days
of ’53. Then he was a mem-
ber of the nominee Council
in the pre-Government-by-
Contradiction days. He sat
in the first Victorian Assem-
bly as member for Castle-
mame, and later on was sent
to England as immigration
agent. Next he returned
to Victoria and became Com-
missioner of Customs in the
Nicholson Cabinet. In 1862,
he drifted to Maoriland
along with the rest of the
“ young iniquities ” that
race who staggered all the
old traditions of the pro-
foundly serious Scotchmen of
Otago, and painted the
solemn province a lurid crim-
son. He was a P.M. in the
Tuapeka district for ten years
or so, and after that, for 17
years, he was the stormiest
politician ever known in the
ante-Fish days of Maoriland.
Now he goes back to Parlia-
ment as an independent
member, so that he can bang
the furniture into ruins with-
out being hindered by party
obligations, and affably heave
bricks at everybody. People
who know Pyke are divided
into two classes—those who
would gladly lend him every
cent they have in the world,
and those who would go a
long way to see him hanged.
Barney Allen, the Mel-
bourne bookie, who, when
confronted by burglars in the
stilly night, lost no time in
handing over his keys and
valuables, says the fraternity
complimented him on his
coolness. Barney is evi-
dently imbued with that
fierce spirit of dare-devilry
which would lead its pos-
sessor to save his life even if he died for it.
Author J. M. Barrie once won a school-
prize offered by the girls to the boy with the
sweetest smile. Barrie is, so far, an exception
to a generally reliable rule. The boy with the
sweet smile and the famous turn-down collar —
that collar which, if it were turned down another
inch, would turn his shirt inside out —is, as a rule,
hanged very young.
It is rumoured in London that the Prince
of Wales has been attacked with facial paralysis,
that grotesque complaint which draws the features
round in the direction of the ear. At all events,
he has remained of late in unwonted seclusion, and
at his age the fate which hangs, in some shape or
other, over every short, stout person who has
lived hard all his life can’t be very far off.
The Duke of Westminster, income several
hundred thousands per year, dresses so shabbily
that his valet turns up his nose at his cast-off
garments- Bedford, Devonshire, Argyle (all
dukes), Isaac Holden, the richest man in the
Commons, Mackay, the “ Silver King ” of
America, each try to ape old, stout John Lucas,
of the N.S.W. Legislative Council, the original
colour of whose clothes can now hardly be told.
Mr. 0. G. Heydon, the recently-appointed
N.S.W. Attorney - General, ambitioned poli-
tics for some years, but failed to secure elec-
tion at Argyle, and subsequently at East Mait-
land. He has the reputation of being an
energetic prosecutor and laborious defender in
criminal cases, and a very persistent and careful
advocate in civil cases. He achieved some repute
in journalism during his early years at the Bar.
Cyril Haviland, the secretary of Sydney
School of Arts, who was arrested the other day,
on his own confession, for a serious abbreviation
in his accounts, was a spiritualist and a poet, in
addition to many other things. Also, he habitually
wore the far-away look of a man who communed
with beings of another world and was unfitted for
reliable arithmetic. A poetic spiritualist is pro-
bably about the worst combination for book-
keeping purposes that could be imagined.
George Ash, M.P. (S.A.),who is an articled
clerk in Premier Kingston’s office, in November
passed the third year examination fortheLL.B.
degree, taking first-class honors and the Stow
prize. He is credited with being the most in-
dustrious member of the Assembly, and he con-
scientiously reads every Bill and paper placed
before Parliament. He is a journalist whose
political career was forced upon him because a
squatter ruined him in a libel-action.
The recently-deceased Hon. Roger Moly-
neux was, a few years ago, well-known in Bohemian
circles in Sydney, where he eked out a precarious
subsistence by scribbling for Punch, &c. As a
linguist he had few superiors, and it was a treat to
hear him recite Hans Breitmann’a ballads. He
was consumptive and for years suffered greatly;
he died a few weeks ago in the comparative odour
of sanctity. His will has been proved by his
brother, Lord Sefton, at the large sum of 60s.
An old Sydney identity has just died at
Jersey, Channel Islands—Mrs. Thomas Goodall-
Gore, aged 76, daughter of John Kinchela, old-
time Attorney-General and a Supreme Court
Judge in the Thirties. Judge Kinchela is buried
at Liverpool (N.S.W.). When on the bench he
was deaf and nearly blind, infirmities which
induced the notorious Major Mudie, of “Castle
Forbes,’’ to jibe at him. Consequently the Major
was horsewhipped in George-street by the Judge’s
son.
Carter Harrison, the deceased Mayor of
Chicago, had been five times chief magistrate of
the Dibbs-cursed city. Prendergast, the oftice-

RETRENCHMENT.
OLD MAN (whose daughter Mr. Jones is courting): “See here!
Since you started coming here every night, I’ve had a
separate meter connected with the drawing-room. I have
sent you the account for your share of the gas-bill.”
Mr. JONES : “Very well, sir, I’ll settle it— and for the future we
need not use gas! ” —(Collapse of old man.)
seeker who shot him, had a narrow escape of being
lynched by the mob. The mystery of it is how
any man could be Mayor even twice in an Ameri-
can city without fatal results. The fact that
Harrison was only shot in his fifth term shows
that the people of Chicago must be a poor-spirited
lot, or else Harrison had given every citizen a
billet of some sort.
George Charles Hawker, the oldest legisla-
tor in S.A., so far as the years of his life are
concerned, has had a remarkable political record.
He was first elected to the Assembly for the
district of Victoria in January, 1858, and was
Speaker from April, 1860, to January, 1865, when
he dropped out of the House. He was re-elected
for Victoria in February, 1875, and resigned in
May, 1883, having, in the meanwhile, held
Ministerial office for nearly four years. He was
back again as member for North Adelaide in
April, 1884, and has filled the seat ever since,
despite many attempts to dislodge him. He is
almost a millionaire, but judiciously votes the
Democratic ticket on occasions.
The history of the Peel family is a melan-
choly illustration of the effect of hereditary dis-
tinction upon human character. Clever old
weaver Peel begat the bright political Robert
whose services were “ rewarded” with a baronetcy.
Robert’s heir inherited the brains of his ancestors,
but soon deteriorated into a raffish man of
pleasure. His title killed his ambition and made
of him a brilliant trifler, with just sufficient
enemy to pump out an eloquent Jingo speech at
widening intervals. Now that this second Robert
is a played-out buck, taking pride in little else
than his moustache, his son, young Bobby, figures
as a bankrupt who has already pawned his
reversionary interest in all the prospects remain-
ing to him as the heir of his fallen dad.
Almost every week the expectations of
smokers are raised by wildly-written advertise-
ments lauding some new brand of cigars, the
which upon sampling are found to be provocative
of nothing but bad words and disappointment.
There is, however, a silver lining to every cloud,
and the man who has invested his money in a box
of unsmokable atrocities is sure to learn—if he
doesn’t know it already—-that for delightful flavour
and excellence of manufacture Frossard’s Swiss
Cigars (25 in the bundle) are a permanent institu-
tion the world over.
When grim old Carlyle wrote his “Sartor
Resartus,” the walking-stick as an accessory to a
man’s garments did not strike him with sufficient
force to write the matter up properly. If poor
old Thomas were alive now and were to visit the
premises of Messrs. G. H. Smith & Co., at 302
George-street—the largest hat manufacturers and
importers in Sydney—his rugged old soul would
receive a shock, and he would realise how
important an item he had omitted. Endless
varieties of the article are displayed, such as stout
cherry, vine in many sorts and designs, malaccas,
black perricle root, black ivory tusks mounted on
partridge wood, etc., etc. All sorts of handsome
designs are shown in chamois hooka, ivory crutch,
and ebony. Umbrellas are also present in infinite
variety.
Judging from its enormous and unprece-
dented sale, Walker’s Whisky, and how to get a
bottle of it, seems to be the one subject that in-
terests the Australian public to the exclusion of
all other topics. And, after all, despite the hoary
old proverb—written by a man who, no doubt, only
drank home-made wine—about liquor stinging
like a serpent, and other things to that effect,
there can be no possible doubt that the man who
sticks to a good brand like Walker’s Whisky has
in him the elements of sound sense, kindliness,
and a healthful life; and cannot be anything else
but a good citizen and an ornament to his
country.

Mashonaland, the territory which the

The farewell demonstration in honour of
Robt. Reid at Melb. Town Hall, was indeed a
ghastly joke—a jerry-built festival, founded on
soft goods and gas.
Microbes, it has been discovered by a
German scientist, can be fired from a rifle along
with the bullet. Every day the hoary romance of
glorious war is being sliced off in big junks.
Two hundred women have been put in
charge of as many small railway stations in Vic-
toria, whereby the department saves £30,000 a
year. When will we get a cheap female Ministry?
G. H. Reid: “Premier Dibbs is the
greatest political tramp and sundowner in the
country, and in all the 125 electorates there is not
one in which he can put the sole of his political
foot.”
The N.S.W, Aborigines Protection Board
receipts, for last quarter, amounted to £24 os.

This left £5 13s. lOd. for Kaween Wikitoria’s
niggers.
Treasurer Playford, in S.A. Assembly:
“The former gardener at Government House got
£lOO, but the present man is willing to do the
work for £8 less.” Economy is the god of the
stupid man in No. 18 hoof-tanks.
Premier Dibbs (being interviewed by a
newspaper man who wanted to know what the
Government intended doing after its defeat) :
“ I’ve got nothing to tell you. You can just go
to a place lined with hot bricks ! ”
The Argus opposes the introduction of an
American railway expert to boss the traffic depart-
mentin the Vic. service: “ We advocate the policy
of Victorian experts for Victorian railways. ” How
would this policy apply to Victorian governors ?
A bill to nationally purchase the minerals
of Great Britain has been tabled by the British
Labour-members ; and Fegan, M.P., is to move
for the nationalisation of N.S.W. coal-mines, if
ever the Assembly gets into working order again.
That long practically-insolvent institution,
the N.S.W. Civil Service Superannuation Fund,
is now in the happy position of receiving £6OOO
and paying out £BOOO per month. The difference

Since the Marquis of Salisbury has pro-
posed “an international agreement for the sup-
pression of Anarchism,” it behoves Mr. Andrews,
of Sydney, and the enterprising Tommy Dodd,
either to arm and entrench themselves, or submit
at once.
The S.A. Government is considering the
advisability of bringing in a bill to prevent law
appeals beyond the local Supreme Court. This is
one of the worst-needed reforms in Australia, and
it is to be hoped the other provinces will follow
Kingston’s lead.
At the last Q. elections, on polling day, a
naked Kanaka —at least he was so nearly naked
that it made no serious difference—with “Vote
for ” chalked on his back, was sent around a
Northern town. An obvious hint herein for
travelling showmen.
The cable states that Herr Somebody-or-
other has expressed his thanks to God for the
escape of the German Emperor and Chancellor
Caprivi. This is either an “ad,” for the Herr’s
piety, or it is meant to show that the Almighty
is having a good time.
During the recent Maoriland elections a
candidate was asked by a female voter if he was
in favour of a Bill to reduce the hours of labour.
To which he replied that if medical men were in
favour of the idea he certainly would support it.
Then a great silence ensued.
Victorian Speaker Tom Bent is reckoned
up by the Scottish Leader as an “ illiterate
market gardener,” who occasional!} 7 hangs his wig
and gown upon the knob of the mace whilst he
delivers “extraordinary harangues on things in
general.” This “ disgustin’ forrin’ parrygrarf,” as
Bent would call it, is really one for Thomas and
two for the House that elected him to the billet.
Any man has a right to be Speaker if he can get
there, and the burly old barnacle from Brighton
did get there.
In his recent Melbourne lecture entitled
“Twenty Years in Pentridge,” Mr. Hosking, a
retired warder of large experience, gave his em-
phatic testimony in favour of the abolition of the
lash. It brutalises both the giver (on the bench)
and the receiver (on the back).
Cabled that the U.S. Democratic party
demands the imposition of a duty on imported
coal and iron ore. This looks so like more Pro-
tection that that famous cabled message of con-
gratulation to President Cleveland seems more
than ever wasted and misplaced.

Edmund Barton, Q.C., makes five ex-
Attorneys-General now in Parliament, the others
being Manning and Simpson, in the Council, and
Wise and Want, in the Assembly. In the Coun-
cil are three ex-Solicitors-General Fauoett,
O’Connor, and Salomons. Manning has held
both offices.
It is a curious sign of the times that the
Sydney Presbytery, the other day, rejected, by a
considerable majority, a motion calling on the
people of N.S. Wales to return none but strictly
pious candidates at next election. Even the
Presbytery seems to have lost its old faith in the
pious candidate.
Another foreign sailor, who fatally stabbed
a messmate, has been sentenced, at Sydney, by
Chief Justice Darley, to three years’ penal servi-
tude. At the same sittings a man charged with
housebreaking got ten years, chiefly, his Honor
said, because he “drew a knife” to prevent
arrest. Proputty again.
During the late Behring Sea trouble,
Herbert, U.S. Secretary for War, accepted the
services of King, the aeronaut, whose duty would
have been, in case of war, to hover over the
British fleet and drop bombs of dynamite on to
the decks. King professes to have mastered some
of the difficulties of balloon steering.
Something more
than meets the fish-
like eye of the Vic-
torian public is lurk-
ing in that much-
advertised mission
of Robert Reid to
Hingland and Ame-
rica. His “mission”
is a peculiar speci-
men of official fid-
dledeedee sur-
rounded by a strange
newspaper glamour.
First of all came
the announcement
that Premier Pat-
terson would like
his sanctified com-
mercial colleague to
go forth and accom-
plish something by
personal investiga-
tion into certain
matters. Then came
journalistic expres-
sions of fear that
Reid’s gigantic
business engage-
ments wouldn’t per-
mit of his quitting
Melbourne, even for
a few weeks. Joyful
paragraphs, to the
effect that Reid was
yielding to the
prayers of the Oabi-
neL followed in
due course; finally
came the patriotic
consent of Reid to
undertake a mission
which, in its na-
tional aspect, is all
moonshine. What
is the dim, mysteri-
ous something in all
this ? Also, how
much money is Vic-
toria going to pay
for Robert Reid’s
incursion into
Canada?

The Vic. Railway Commissioners announce
that for the future “ladies not engaged in busi-
ness ” may obtain periodical tickets over the
suburban lines at half-rates. Females, however,
who are working for a living do not share in this
concession. The Fat Woman is as much a political
institution as the Fat Man.
When Parkes, who turns with every politi-
cal sign, bids frantically for the votes of the
Active Service Brigade—the democracy or chaos
is coming right enough. People now young may
yet live to see Parkes the Anarchist carrying red
flags at the ripe age of 110, There is no end to
the old man’s possibilities.
The warm-blooded Kingston refused to
allow Symon, Q. 0., to appear nominally for the
Crown, but really on behalf of a private prose-
cutor, in S.A. Criminal Court. Symon appeared
nevertheless, and proved that Kingston had no
power to interfere. In this affair Kingston seems
to have made an ass of himself.
S.A. Legislative Council rejected the
Kingston land-taxation proposals. The same old
National Ass crowd voted against the measure :
Angas, Baker, Bos worth, Stirling, Warren, and
Duncan (squatters), Copley (farmer), Darling and
Simpson (capitalists), and Ward (pig vote). The
Government was beaten by one vote.
The rumour that John Hoolan, M.P., will
resign his Parliamentary seat in favour of Tom
Glassey, the Queensland Labour-leader, wears an
air of probability when considered in connection
with the recent reports concerning meteoric
showers of libel-writs against the Mundic Miner
(Georgetown), which vigorous publication is
owned by Hoolan.
Parkes (describing Dibbs and Co.) :
“Burglars . . . sharpers . . . heathen
Chinese . . . traitors . . . coveting des-
picably the mean patronage of the Crown of this
prostituted country . . . sticking in degraded
office and drawing salary . . . waiting to be
kicked out . . . the vulgar dramatic longings
of George Dibbs,” &c.
A strenuous attempt was made, when the
military vote was before the S.A. Assembly, to
wipe the forces out of existence altogether, but
the War party commanded a majority of one in
the test division. The Ministry is pledged, how-
ever, to put the knife in deeper, although already
the vote has been cut down from £46,000 in
1892-3 to .£23,000 for 1893-4.
The new Yankee Brown-Segmental gum

armour. Two of these persuasive weapons are on
board of Marshal Peixoto’s New York auxiliary
fleet, which hoped to corner De Mello’s squadron
in the narrow waters of Rio harbour.
Melb. stockbroker G. D. Meudell, who is,
or was recently, in London, booming private Fat
Man interests, has more than the usual gall of his
class. In a recent press interview, he attributed
all the disasters that followed the Melb. land-
boom to the “so-called Labour-party, whose
power, through want of funds, is broken for the
time being.” “The representatives of this party,”
he adds, “ have not been business men, under-
standing £ s. d.”
One Allen, an American senator, thought
he had got away with the jaw championship,
recently. He spoke without intermission from a
quarter-past five in the afternoon till eight o’clock
on the following morning, his only nourishment
being a cup of tea. A London paper, however,
brings the American gent, up with a round turn
and tells him that there is a man in N.S.W.
Assembly, named Neild, whose heels he couldn’t
see for dust.
The sudden prorogation of N.S.W. Parlia-
ment blocks two little bills which Neild, M.L.A.,
was just about to introduce. One was a short
measum providing that sheep should only be
slaughtered on Monday, so that they might enjoy
the advantages of the Sabbath before execution.
The’other enacted that, if a letter was exactly full
weight before the stamp was put on, and the
stamp made it overweight, the overweight should
not be charged for.

MINISTERIAL ITEM.
Robt. Reid, of Smellbourne, embarks on his “important mission.”
The cable-man had a bad attack of horror*
one day last week, and sent along an assortmen
of gory sensations. They included a dynamite
outrage in the French Chamber of Deputies; the
confession of the dynamiter; rumours of antici-
pated blasting operations at London and Wash-
ington ; a riot at Palermo, 14 rioters killed, and
the town-clerk and his wife seized and beheaded
by infuriated “socialists;” and the capture of a
Customs officer at Bari (Italy), and the burning of
him alive with kerosene accompaniment, on
account of his interference with a religious fes-
tival.
In the S.A. Electoral Bill, which has just
passed the Assembly for the third time since 1890,
are provisions fixing the maximum expenditure on
a contest at .£lOO, directing that all nominations
shall take place on one day, and preventing a
candidate from standing for more than one seat
at the same time. It also allows candidates to
talk up to midnight before polling day. At
present their mouths are shut when the nomina-
tions have been received. The measure also
enfranchises a number of Crown tenants who have
lost their votes, so far as the Upper House is
concerned, through a technicality under the exist-
ing Act.
Apropos of N.S.W. ex-Attorney-General
Barton’s disastrous brief in the Proudfoot case: J.
H. Symon, when Attorney-General of S.A. in
1881, accepted a brief in a big case against the
Ministry of which he was a member. No one
seemed to be especially shocked, and the matter
passed almost unnoticed. The proceeding, like
most objectionable things, was in accordance with
legal etiquette. Symon is a potent authority on
legal etiquette.
At the division which led to the practical
downfall of the Dibbs (N.S.W.) Government,
Minister Slattery voted in defence of the practice
of members of the Cabinet holding briefs against
the State. As Mr. Slattery, at that same moment,
was . acting as solicitor in the case of Seymour
against his colleague, the Minister for Works,
and consequently against the State, he, at least,
had the courage of his opinions.
almost every lawyer holding office in an Austra-
lian Cabinet has made it a practice, from time
immemorial, to take briefs against the Cabinet of
which he forms a part. The Bulletin would
now like to know if any legal Minister ever took
a brief in his private capacity, against himself in
his capacity. There doesn’t seem to be
anything in the etiquette of the profession to
prevent him doing so.
The principal feature of the great Foreign -
trade meeting, last week, at Sydney Protestant
Mall, was the presence of a crowd of bruisers,
bullies, _ pugilists, chuckers-out, and assorted
plug-uglies, whose business it was to bash out of
human shape anybody who didn’t seem to agree
with the principal speakers, and then throw him
in a maimed condition on the pavement. They
were an enthusiastic crowd, and one or two dis-
sentients had most of their clothes torn off and
were battered almost beyond recognition. It is
about time the police took cognisance not only of
the hired chucker-out, but also of his employer.
If they don’t, the beetle-browed brigade will pre-
sently run N.S.W. politics, and all public meet-
ings will be unanimous because the opposition has
been previously removed on a shutter to the
hospital.
N.S.W. Minister Copeland’s political
illustrations from the game of euchre would go
down badly with Gerald Anderson, Queensland
Under-Secretary for Education. A bush-teacher,
writing to the Education Department on one
occasion, used a figure of speech about “playing
the bower,” and great was the shock the epistle
gave to the office, Anderson desired to dismiss
the offender at once, but the Minister wrote a
brief and profane minute saying that the teacher’s
language “ was d impudent, but as otherwise
he was a of a good fellow, a formal rebuke
would be sufficient.” Accordingly, Anderson
committed his indignation to paper, and informed
the sinner that it was highly unbecoming in a man
of liberal education to express himself in the
language of a low, vulgar card-game, and that if
the offence were repeated the public service would
know him no more.
Present superannuation system in N.S.W.
public service is grossly unfair, and it is no
wonder that the younger barnacles object to it.
Unless a man is retrenched on the score of
incurable disease tie must patiently corrode in the
service until he is 60 years old before he can
claim anything; if he retires voluntarily before
that age he gets nothing at all, and the payments
that he has made into the fund are simply for-
feited. It was hoped that this forfeiture system
would keep the Superannuation Fund alive and
solvent; but it hasn’t. So many large, healthy-
looking men have been smitten in the prime of
life by immortal complaints—that is to say, by
hopeless diseases which cause the patient to live
( and draw his pension for ever afterwards—and
have thereupon retired to become an eternal
burden on the Fund, that it has never had a
chance from the verv homnnini'.
The Sydney Active Service Brigade is now
“laid for ” at public meetings by a rival organisa-
tion, the Mosquito Club, whose short and simple
political creed consists in throwing the Active
Service Brigade men down the steps whenever
opportunity offers. Naturally, this will result in
the formation of another organisation whose busi-
ness it will be to jump on the Mosquito Club if it
doesn’t leave the Active Service men alone.
Then the Foreign-trade hired bruiser will climb
on top of the other organisation, and the Protec-
tionist bruiser, who will presently develope him-
self, will attack the last-named from behind, and
the policeman, as the general representative of law
and order, will get on top of the heap. The only
certain consequence of all this is the flattening-out
of the Active Service gentleman who, in the
general scrum, will have $ll his friends and
enemies sitting impartially on his breathing
apparatus.

Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will be one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
.£lO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,
vho will be pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

The last letter written by Mrs. Knorr, the
Melbourne baby-assassin, before her trial, was
addressed to an old friend of her better days. In
it she implored him, if the trial went against her,
to take care of her helpless children ; also to call
at a certain shop where she had left two ostrich
feathers to be curled, and get them for her, so
that she might wear them in the dock. It was a
long letter full of agitated entreaty, but the
orphaned babes and the two ostrich feathers ran
all through it side by side.

The Hopetouna are ever troubled by
thoughts of diphtheria at their huge Government
House, and when the youthful heir developed sore
throat, the other week, his parents flew back to
town —they had been staying at Salmon Wilson’s
place—on the sombre wings of their old alarm.
The drainage of the “ ’Ouse ” is under suspicion.
Moreover, the odour of the adjacent Yarra, on a
calm, warm evening, is apt to make a young man’s
fancy lightly turn to thoughts of tomb.

Maoriland paper :—“ The introduction of
women into politics entails the possibility of
tremendous evil to the community in the near
future.” The anti-land-grab crank, the teetotal
fanatic, and the anarchist prophet will probably
be succeeded by a more horrible infliction as
follows :
The ‘ New Australia ” movement is bound
to boom merrily now. A lady in Balmain has
received a letter from a young female friend who
sailed in the Royal Tar, telling of moonlight
dances on the hurricane-deck of the steamer while
steaming up the Rio de la Plata, and the music of
sweet guitars, played, no doubt, by handsome
young Spanish-Americans with dark eyes and
long, curling black moustaches. And there was
also a very polite steamer officer who would
always say : “With your permission, senorita
and then the soldiers that formed the guard of
honour at the Theatre Nacional at Asuncion were
also very polite, and told the young lady from
Balmain that the Australian girls—and she in
particular—were very pretty. From this day
forth nine-tenths of the unmarried women of
Australia will want to go to Paraguay, and riot
among moonlight nights and guitars and hand-
some officers and such things, and the common-
place Australian man-emigrant that has dusty
boots and a grimy face and a bad hat will be
rejected and despised until the girl gets hungry
and vho black-moustached cavalier fades away
into dim distance.
SANTA CLAUS RECONSTRUCTED.
“I’m afraid this is about all I’ve got to give you this year!”
A few iteus from the gushful epistle
We all sleep on the floor, and have our meals gipsy-
fashion, in tlie open air. It is great fun. We eat oranges
all day and sit in the shade. . . Towards evening we
go for a swim in the creek. . . I ate twenty oranges
yesterday. [This young lady enjoys good health.] We
get a t icusand for a shilling and as many as we want for
nothing. . . We transhipped at Monte Video to a
beautiful steamer, the Rio Parana. We used to have dances
every night. The Spaniards would often play the guitar,
and when they didn’t our own fellows would play the
violin or concertina. At Asuncion crowds of people came
to welcome us, both Spaniards and Europeans. .
We camped two days in the theatre, an enormous brick
building built by King Lopez [“ King ” is good], and the
Spaniards used to bring us eggs, oranges, meat,
vegetables, and water, and would not hear of pay
ment. Some of the upper classes are remarkably
handsome. [No doubt some of the guitar push—
hence “ upper classes.”] . . Some of the boys used
to hand us in oranges and cigarettes through the
gates, and the soldiers would peel them for us with their
swords [shades of Lopez! and these swords imy have once
got polished by hewing human livers]. . . They would
tell us we were very pretty, made us very polite speeches.
. . One boy, about 19, told me he would be charmed
to visit me in my new home, and pushed a bundle of
cigars into my hand. . . All the women smoke, and I
suppose they thought we did.
Further on this young lady, who writes charm-
ingly throughout, says :
The Indians are dreadful thieves, but are not bad-
natured—they will bring you half-a-dozen eggs and steal
something twenty times the value. . . We are dread-
fully short of reading matter, unless we choose to wade
through books on Socialism and political economy and
such-like. We have organised a literary club and lam
one of the members. T . We have the funniest tents
you ever saw, some made of calico, but more of blankets,
bed-ticking and cretonne—mother’s is like Joseph’s coat
of many colours.

The minute books of the first Australian
Masonic Lodge in N.S.W., recording proceedings
from 1820 to 1841, were recently discovered in a
lumber-room in the Lands Office and handed over
to the Lodge, now No. 1 Australian Constitution.
In the first years of this century, Henry Hayes,
transported for abduction, established a Masonic
Lodge, for which offence he was lagged to Van
Diemen’s Land.
Sir Edwin Arnold,
lecturing on the beauty of
cheerfulness, the other day,
couldn’t refrain from drag-
ging in a reference to Princess
Alice who “died so divinely
from the kisses of her sick
child.” We have been
nauseated with that “touch-
ing ” royal incident. Queen
Victoria’s daughter did noth-
ing that any other mother
wouldn’t do. She nursed
her child, and kissed the
patient, and perhaps inhaled
fever-germs during the em-
brace. She, the mother,
died from the fever because
she was a princess who “lived
high.” The writer has seen
a poor woman hugging to
her breast a baby covered
with small-pox sores. Pro-
bably she didn’t die of that
disease. She was too starved
to catch it.

A definition of a naughty
story : “A story which one
woman would enjoy, though
two women would be dread-
fully shocked.”
Sir Christopher Teesdale, Y.C., who died
the other day, had been a Court flunkey for 30
years or more, though he ranked as one of the
youngest of ‘‘Crimean veterans.” Before drop-
ping into the narnby billet of Master of the
Ceremonies to his Gracious Queen, he had a long
term at “Equerrying” for Albert Edward, who
never went anywhere without “ Colonel Teesdale
in attendance.” An imposing person was Tees-
dale. The writer remembers him sending for the
head waiter at a Scarborough hotel, to ask that
overawed menial what the devil he meant by
allowing flies in the dining-room. There was only
one fly to be seen, but it had happened to buzz
around the kernel’s soup, and the kernel wouldn’t
have it, by Heaven ! Subsequently, the manager
arrived with the main body of the hotel staff, and
ran the demnition fly to earth. This incident
shows the magnitude of the things that go to
make up a Royal equerry’s daily life.
The first woman ever thrown out of a
political meeting in Maoriland was landed out
on the crown of her bonnet, the other day, at
Wellington. Being inflated with her new dignity
as a female elector the henfranchised one per-
sisted in interrupting the candidate on the plat-
form, and shaking a somewhat withered gamp at
him with violent objurgations: The meeting
stood it patiently for a while, but at last it could
stand it no longer, and the air was rent with a
cry of “ heave her out.” Then, as she flatly
refused to be quiet, she was taken up as gently as
circumstances would permit, and heaved. There
was a vision of a bonnet with two broken feathers
in it, an agitated brown skirt, two darned stock-
ings of uncertain hue, a faded umbrella rising and
falling in the melee, a hysterical voice telling the
assailants that they were no gentlemen, and the
first ejected she-voter in Australasia was urged
down the steps and left weeping on the pavement.

A vote tor thrift should be given the man
whose wife hauled him before the Red fern police-
court last week. She was asked —‘‘Has your
husband contributed anything to your support
lately?” ‘‘Yes; he bought me a pair of boots
and gave me 3d. about a month ago.”
A well - known
lawyer, in one of the
Australian oa pitals,
recently removed into
a new house. The
mansion had been
previously occupied
by some ladies of the
festive persuasion—
the kind who invari-
ably leave behind
them a great arr ay of
champagne bottles in
the back-yard but
he was altogether un-
aware of the fact.
The first intimation
came in the shape of
a visit from an inti-
mate male friend who,
finding the lady of the
house seated on the
verandah, cheerfully
prodded her in the
ribs with his umbrella
and said : “ Where’s
Eliza?” Then, seeing
the house-father in
the distance, he hailed
him with a yell of
derision, and told him
that he was a gay
dog, or words to that
effect. The scene
closed with two law-
yers frantically argu-
ing on the verandah,
and the lady who had
been- prodded with the umbrella in tears and great
indignation.

The Gaulois bewails the demoralisation
of French kitchen poetry by the savage influence
of British taste. “ A French 090 k who goes to
London generally loses half his ability in a
twelvemonth,” it seems. The gourmands of INew
Babylon are addicted to great masses of plain
food, the preparation of which is bound to blunt
the fine edge of culinary art. And, then, their
brutal hankering after horrible sauces, called the
Worcestershire or the Anchovies ! Mong Doo .
The gros bifsteak and the sauce of Worcestershire
are fatal to all that is beautiful and sublime in the
teekling of the palate.

Very Rev. and very ancient Dean Macart-
ney introduced a touch of religious melodrama
into his performance at Melbourne pro-Cathedral,
the other Sunday morning. Staggering under
the tropical heat, the old gentleman of 95 next
birthday had to be assisted all the way up to the
pulpit. He got through his sermon without a
hitch, and then added a solemn postscript, “Dear
brethren, I have come here to-day in much
weakness to endeavour to warn you. I feel that
my days for witnessing the truth are very nearly
ended.” It goes without saying that the congre-
gation was visibly impressed, but there was
nothing strictly startling in the Dean’s statement.
Intelligent people don’t need to be warned that
clergymen are not immortal, and as regards the
Macartney idea of “the truth,” it is far too
brimstoney to convince unemotional persons.
Moreover, no preacher is entitled to support weak
arguments with illogical references to his extreme
age, and the Dean’s obstinate old faith in a red-
hot Sheol is not a bit more worthy of childlike
acceptation even if his years were 600 in number.

The great success of the Victorian Sunday
excursion trains is probably the beginning of the
end of the desolate Melbourne Sabbath. Nothing
outside the great desert of Sahara was ever
sadder or more depressing than that awful Day
of Rest. It was an utter desolation—a long
vision of deserted streets with no rational amuse-
ment in it, no libraries, reading-rooms, picture
galleries, concerts, no hope or joy or brightness
or recreation—nothing but occasional discordant
church-bells and bricks and mortar. The horrible
silence and iron-greyness of everything ate into
the soul. Everything was suspended except the
Yarra smells, and the interest on one’s over-
draft, and the desire to commit suicide and get
away from it all. The generation of bank-
wreckers which grew up under the influence of
Melbourne Sabbatarianism were in keeping with
the rest of the system. Like it they were grim
and serious and of a dull-brown cast of soul, and
their morals were of the kind that grow up in a
community which is always sneaking silently
round to the back-door of the public-house, and
breathing mysterious pass-words through the key-
hole that it may get in surreptitiously and
whisperingly drink muddy beer in a room where
all the blinds are down. Probably the Sabbath

Mrs. Lynn Linton goes for the cigarette
woman :
It is an uncleanly habit and unappetising. It tinges
the teeth and it fouls the fingers ; while lips heated and a
breath heavy with the scent of stale tobacco are surely
less delightful than the fragant freshness which belongs
to youth and is associated with beauty in a woman. And,
do what she will, the scent clings, and more persistently
about her than about a man. In her long hair alone the
odour of tobacco is predominant an odour which all her
specifics are powerless to banish in favour of something
more subtle and enticing. Severe smokers among men
are offensive enough, Heaven knows! Add to them
severe smokers among women, and we shall have a com-
bination of disgust, a reduplication of distastefulness.
Think of a woman nursing her baby while smoking a
cigar; your cook dropping the ashes of her pipe into the
stew; your lady’s-maid burning little round pinholes in
your brocade ; all the thousand and one household duties
which fall to the share of women, interrupted or damaged
by the universal pipe.

a coating of green weed and Yarra mud. _ Lately
he observed, apropos of drink and insanity and
similar topics, that he had often requested wives
to keep razors out of their husbands’ way, “ only
to be told that dear Tom would never commit
suicide. Then I have been sent for to find dear
Tom with his head cut off.” This met with due
applause, although it never struck the Yarra
Ghoul that there are heaps of things besides razors
good enough to cut a throat with —a dinner-knife,
for instance, or a garden scythe, or_ a busted
sardine-tin, or a piece of glass. The writer knows
BRUTALLY TRUE.

The godly men who run the parish church
at King-Edward in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,
being in want of anew shepherd, advertised, and
the following printed circular was sent to the men
who were named as references by the applicants :
King-Edward, July 8, 1893.
Sir, —The King-Edward Congregational Committee re-
quest that you will confidentially favour them with in-
formation on the following matters regarding Rev. Mr.
, who has applied for the Church of King-Edward :
1. Age.
2. Height.
3. Physical strength and health.
4. Personal appearance and manners.
6. Father’s occupation.
6. Freedom from defect or deformity.
7. Voice—whether loud, low, harsh, monotonous, whin-
ing, drawling, squeaky, provincial in accent, dis
tinctly heard in a large church.
8. Popularity in his present situation—causes.
9. Sunday School work.
10. Music—does he sing or play on any instrument.
11. Visitation—does he visit in the parish where he lives,
and do you believe that if appointed he would visit
the whole parish twice a year ?
12. Temperance—is he an abstainer from spirituous
liquors,; or, if not an abstainer, does he abstain
from spirituous liquors in his ministerial visitations:
and is he strictly temperate always at other timea
and has he always been so?
—I am, dear sir, yours faithfully,
(Signed) George Barclay.

One of the features of the Maoriland elec-
tion was the house-father who marched his wife
and daughters to the poll, and insisted on going
along with each of them into the little box, that
looks like the place where one secretly negotiates
a loan from Mosenstein on the family spoons, to
supervise the filling of the ballot paper. One old
gentleman, who evidently bad bis household in a
good state of discipline, had twice to be removed
out of the box by violence, and then he indignantly
accused the returning officer of breaking up the
peace of families and generally disturbing hi*
happy home.
Not empire-lust, nor greed for spoil,
By Mammon torn from those who toil,
Nor curse bacchantio;
Not the sharp rush of blood-stained feet
Of Anarchy through city’s street;
No tale romantic,
To show the future how we fell
The historian of our race shall tell,
In tome pedantic.
He’ll point, when on us he descants,
To woman reaching for man’s pants
With straggles frantic.
C.A.C.
THE CONSPIRACY.
We sing a sombre song
Of plots to murder Dibbs.
A Hindoo came along
Enquiring for “ His Nibs.”
He winked his heathen eye
And muttered, “Caitiff knave I
I’ll kill him presently
In fact, I’ve dug his grave.”
A hero stood on guard
At good Sir George’s door:
He viewed the stranger hard
(O, lynx-eyed janitor !)
And saw that he was armed—
Observed a pistol large.
“Police 1” he cried, alarmed,
“ Here, take this wretch in charge.”
They seized the weapon grim,
Which gave them quite a shock
In each official limb.
The hammer wouldn’t cook.
No little ounce of lead
The barrel did contain:
“ Now, praise the Lord !” they said,
“We all can breathe again.”
Sir Dibbs he heard as how
The miscreant was caught;
He wiped his clammy brow,
But did not go distraught.
Though warnings he had had
Of his impending doom.
He cried in accents sad—
“ Bring Guy Fawkes to my room."
There, there the villain stood,
Cut off from hope of flight.
“ What want you with my blood?”
Exclaimed the hardy knight.
But Guy Fawkes held his tongue,
Made no reply at all.
No doubt he will get hung,
And like a soldier fall.
Sir Dibits is still alive,
Too brave to show dismay ;
How long he will survive
The poet cannot say.
The plot to shoot him down
Is being plotted still;
He’li die to save the Crown-
Poor man 1 we know he will.


When the eyes become weak or the lids inflamed
Rnd sore, a scrofulous condition of the blood is
indicated. For scrofula, in all its forms, Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla is the best remedy. It invigorates
the blood and expels all humors.

In a Melb. city police-court, t’other day
the Law’s assininity broke out in a quite unex-
pected place. An accused person, under remand
couldn’t be admitted to bail for the reason that
his bondsman was unable to provide any better
security than hard cash. The Law, it seems has
no power to regard cash “on the nail ” as a satis-
factory equivalent for a paper claim against house-
hold property or stock-in-trade. And since the
would-be bondsman in this case possessed neither
houses with a mortgage on them, nor goods of
doubtful value, and was merely prepared to plank
down the substance of .£5OO instead of the shadow
of a like amount, the Law declined his bag of
specie, and the prisoner was removed in custody
according to the chuckle-headed statoots.

The woman-vote at the recent Maoriland
election was gall and wormwood to the wife of
many an old member. As a rule, the wife of a
politician who had a reasonably sure seat was
wont to give herself airs of importance, and snort
contemptuously at the lady on the other side of
the fence. But the female vote changed all that,
and she had to put on her best bonnet and go
round and abase herself to the grocer’s wife.and
the wash-lady and other persons of inferior status.
As a rule, she had a hard time of it. One old
politician s wife began by calling on the woman
next door and asking for her vote. “ You know,”
she said, with a winning smile, “we have been
near neighbours for many years.” “Yes, we
have, certainly, but we have never spoken to each
other till to-day. <7ood-day.” Then the door
banged.

A Melbourne policeman lately lost his
false teeth in a swimming-bath—-he had been
piddling about in the shallow end, and after he
came out he went and looked with an awe-stricken
expression at the deep end, and while he was
yawning in a somewhat ample fashion, the eating
apparatus dropped into the water. He gave the
bath attendant 30s. to dive and recover them.
This suggests a whole lot of things. An aged
constable with artificial shop-teeth isn’t likely to
be a very active man in pursuit of a criminal. A
constable who won’t dive for his own teeth, looks
like a man who is hardly fitted for a risky calling.
And a constable who has 30s. to give away in that
reckless fashion must have been on night-duty a
good deal, and have made the best use of his
opportunities.

Some enemy has forwarded to The Bulle-
tin a copy of a neatly got-up little book called
“The Cornstalk : His Habits and Habitats,” by
Whaks Li Kell, which is intended to be a wildly
humoristic satire on all phases of Australian life.
This, however, it just misses, and the author gives,
instead, just 165 pages of Dead Sea drivelling, with
here and there hoary old English jokes uprearing
their horrid fronts like the weed-covered and
barnaely piles of an abandoned wharf. The most
notable atrocity of the lot is a kind of poetic
treadmill of 117 verses. The book is published by
Troedel, Cooper & Co. with “all rights reserved.”
This, for the sake of our common humanity, is
good news.

Last week, in Townsville (Q.), a gentle-
man just discharged from the local gaol (where he
had been in retreat in re larceny of a cheque) im-
mediately partook of many drinks, engaged a cab,
and drove up to the Court-house, with a friend.
He saw the B.M. and asked for a free pass to the
Towers, “ where he owned a valuable mine.” He
also introduced his friend, and wanted him to be
franked along by rail as a wages-rnan. The P.M.
didn’t see it, however, and the scheme fell
through.

One day last week Magistrate Smithers,
at Redfern Police-court, sentenced a man to one
month’s imprisonment for giving his wife an ugly
gasli on the side of the face with an axe ! Truly
wives are cheap in N.S.W.
A man who was lately arrested in London
for stealing a carpet-bag asked the mercy of the
court, “as he was just on the point of sailing for
Sydney, where he had a relative high up in a
certain banking institution.” “What is his
name?” asked the magistrate, with a doubtful
voice. “Mr. ,” was the reply. “Ha!”
said his Worship, taking up a newspaper, “I have
his name here ” (a proud smile lit up the prisoner’s
face); “he’s just got five years. I couldn’t let
you go to him. Three months.”

The Jin de siecle society woman is thus
caressingly alluded to by Sarah Grand, the
authoress of “The Heavenly Twins” :
For vulgarity, for boldness, for folly, ignorance, want
of principle, petty weakness, intrigue, and positive vice
you must go to the average society woman. Her one
motive is self-seeking. She is a bad wife, a bad mother,
and a false friend. For intellect, she has a fair supply of
shrewdness and cunning ; for religion, a rotten con-
glomerate of emotional superstitions that do not improve
her conduct; for virtue, the hope of not being found out;
while for charity, good feeling, modesty, and every
womanly attribute she substitutes tact—the tact to
respond outwardly to what she sees is required of her by
different people.

That alleged syndicate for the capturing

From the first it was declared that scandalous
“ reasons ” accounted for Balfour’s safety in a
country which would willingly arrange the afore-
said treaty if it were warmly desired at the
British end. No such warm desire was shown
until the private kidnapping of Jabez became a
matter of public discussion, whereupon Lord
Rosebery moved in the matter. Now it is to be
presumed that Jabez Balfour will also move in the
matter and find another place of refuge.

Editor Bulletin, — A correspondent asks
in your issue of 16th Sept., “How those letter
titles are conferred ?” The answer is simple. By
paying two guineas to the Royal Geographical
Society one can be made in 24 hours a F.R.G.S.
Isn’t every advertising Anglo-Australian one?
The raison d'etre of all these pretentious societies
is £ s. d., which must be got anyhow. Is not
almost every advertising Anglo-Australian also
‘F.L.S.,” which means “Fellow of the Society
of Literature”? Any ambitious Australian can
have a whole alphabet tacked to his name if he
will but come down with the dust. For the
modest sum of one sov. he may even become a
non-resident Fellow of the Imperial Institute
and claim the proud title of “F.I. Inst.” The
Royal Society is the only one which there is any
difficulty in getting admittance to, and yet even
amongst that learned body there are scores of
humbugs.—E. J. Jerrems, London, Nov. 14.

The New Zealand Elections.
The elections now progressing in New Zealand
mark an epoch in the advance of the world’s
civilisation. From what vve hear there will be no
cause to regret the innovation in politics now
inaugurated; and we shall hail with delight the
realisation of another proof of the assertion that
woman is equally competent with man to conduct
and control the multifarious items that make up
our existence. But there is a subject of greater
importance even than those two momentous
questions, and that is the enfranchisement of the
body, for what is the power to vote compared with
the exquisite felicity of experiencing the pulsations
of healthy blood percolating through a system
untainted by disease, and uncontaminated by in-
fection of any kind ? And yet there are thousands
who, through careless indifference, or indolent
perversity, fail to avail themselves of the great
medicinal remedy and natural restorative, “Mar-
shall’s Tonic Nervine.” That vitalizing agent
subjugates disease, overcomes weakness, replen-
ishes healthy vigour, and emancipates the patient
from the seeds of death, so that after a short
course of the remedy he becomes enfranchised,
both in mind and body. Another grateful witness
to its value, Mr. Thomas Green, bookbinder,
Shephard-street, Marrickville, writes: “Having
been suffering from general weakness for several
years, I got no relief from any medicine I took
till I tried Marshall’s Tonic Nervine. Then, from
the first, I felt the greatest benefit, felt strong and
healthy again. You may publish this for others’
benefit, if you choose, as I think they ought to
know.’
"Vesuvius in Flames.”
One day an Englishman who had become a resid-
ent in Naples was astounded and charmed at the
sight of the burning mountain. The appalling
grandeur of the thing intoxicated him with delight.
The terrific explosions, accompanied as they were
by the projection of huge boulders and burning
lava, presented a scene of weird and awful propor-
tions. From that moment he knew of nothing
half so grand as Vesuvius inflames. In thecours,
of years he left Italy and took up his abode in the
States. One day he met an American who boasted
very exultantly of his country. In a little while
each found himself trying to outpace the other in
the relation of the most wonderful thing he had
witnessed. The sublimest thing the Englishman
could remember was the mountain conflagration.
The Yankee gave a chilling smile, shrugged his
shoulders, and waited half impatiently for the end
of the story. With a cynical and contemptuous
air he said, “ Look here, stranger, did vou ever
see the Ealls?” “Falls; no.” “ Ah,, I thought
so,” replied the man of the stars and stripes.
‘ Now, my friend, you go back to Naples, and
bring Vesuvius over here, bag and baggage, rocks,
thunder, lava, and all the paraphernalia of the old
spitfire, and place it under the falls, and Niagara
will pour such a volume of water into its belching
mouth, that in less than a week not a scrap of fire
will be left.” “Impossible,” the Britisher ex-
claimed. “Its fires would send your billowing
cascades into huge clouds of steam and make
another crater in its place.” After all, Vesuvius
with its fires is as nothing when compared to the
hidden flames that burn in man. Internal shock
rends his frame. Destroying forces continue their
work until met by Warner’s “Safe” Cure,
which paralyses their strength and finally delivers
the sufferer from their grip. No matter how
emaciated or depleted the system, Warner’s
“Safe” Cure rebuilds the broken channels, re-
pairs the shattered system and rejuvenates the
whole body.

My Dear Moorabinda—
Miss Stewart sported one good-looking dress in
“Princess Ida” at Sydney Lyceum— a cream-
coloured brocade, cut a la Essie Jenyns as J uliet,
with a cream-colour court train, lined with dull-
red shawl-pattern, the dress lightened with regular
Golcondas of stage “ jules.” It was the most eye-
arresting turn-out on the zoological-looking stage,
where the recumbent damsels in spots and stripes
appeared like so many leopards and zebras. Lady
Blanche —in the plentiful person of Elsie Cameron
—appeared to be dressed in mackintosh stuff,
and was as shiny as a tree lizard.
The blue-and-white pattern of Miss Young’s
gaberdine suggested cheap crockery-wa.re. By
the way, I really think a damsel who is, so to
speak, well-developed—to put it meekly—ought
never to wear a straight, pinaforish dress, but if
she must, something ought to be let out at the
hem to allow for the development. May Pollard,
in violet velvet and rich brocade, produced a very
paintable effect; and when the glittering Amazons
took the stage in the last screech, it almost looked
as if the pantomime was upon us.
The men in “ Ida ” were smudgily dressed, I
thought —worth eight-and-six per 3'ard and all
that, but seedy colours. The trio of adventurous
lordlings were as dingy as so many mopokes. The
assumption of girls’ robes on the stage gave rise to
a little horse-play—but it was interesting to see
how the phenomenally-neat Bracy put his_ robe
and cravat on, as though he had a dozen mirrors
to go by, while the hastily put-on gowns of the
other two looked as tho’ somebody had dressed
them with a stable-fork. “Princess Ida” was
soulfully staged, and the only contretemps oc-
curred when Melissa hugged Fiorian on the prompt
side, and her plumed helmet tumbled off with a
sound of falling fire-irons.
That perspiring adage, “ If at first you don’t
succeed, try again,” has beeff once more verified
by the election of Dr. Grace Robinson to the
onerous position of resident medical officer at the
new place d'accouchees (these things sound ever so
much better in French—at least, to the uneman-
cipated ear) at “Floodgate,” Botany - street,
Moore Park, Sydney. Dr. Robinson, it will be
remembered, is the lady over whose non-election
to a similar position at the women-managed
Children’s Hospital, at the Glebe, such a nice
little battle waged, some months ago.
Dr. Robinson is a slight, pale, fair and very
juvenile-looking resident medico in petticoats, and
will go down to posterity as the very first lady to
have medical charge of a public institution in
Australia. Besides which Dr. Robinson has a
lovely chance to cover herself with grisly glory
and become the ladies’ doctor par excellence on
the strength of the opportunities for practising
she’ll have. It is a great deal to know for certain
that your particular Death-dodger isn’t getting
rusty from disuse in the interim when you don’t
happen to want a blue pill.
I confess I am not astonished to hear that the
Sydney branch of the Girls’ Friendly Society is at
ebb tide pecuniarily, and that the attendance has
dwindled down several hundreds since ’92. Con-
sequently great efforts are being made in social
circles to raise the necessary needful, and for a
time it is probable that the G.F.S. will take the
hat from the Women’s College or the Thirlmere
Hospitals and other pet enthusiasms.
Expressed in a verbal nutshell, the G.F.S. is
home for itinerant or stationary virtue —the
of institution which flourishes best in a more
rigorous climate than this, and under more oppres-
sive social conditions. The Australian girl, is very
seldom frost-bitten, and hardly ever helpless, and
she goes with a calm front from Cape Yorke to
Wilson’s Promontory if necessary, playing off her
own bat all the way. She doesn’t need a Blue
Ribbon lady in a poke bonnet to meet her at the
railway station, and take her in charge as if she
had to be fed by hand and didn’t know enough to
wash her face without getting soap in her eyes.
Therefore, in a land where maidenhood is more
rampant than retiring, the coddling club fades
away to a fad, and the news that a cold frost is
settling over the Girls’ Friendly Society doesn’t
even provoke the mildest sort of surprise.
Are any big guns threatening Sydney during
the next civic year? Because, if they aren’t, why
did Alderman Burdekin suddenly want the
Mayoral stipend raised five centuries ? On Mayor
Mannings re-re-re-re-election (he is four times
Mayor), the other day, there was quite a pow-
wow, I b dieve, as to whether a man could enter-
tain society on £lOOO a year, and, as the motion
was lost, I suppose the concensus of opinion was
that he can.
But, of course, it all depends. If you (my
remarks are now addressed exclusively to Mayors)
are “at home” with champagne to all the world
and his wife at frequent periods, and give many
small, medium, and large hops in the season, then
a “cool thou.” wouldn’t cover the gas-bill; but
entertaining like that is a matter of taste. There
are no by-laws that I know of ordering “ His
Washup ” to give so many capers per season, and
the entertainment of distinguished deadbeats
doesn’t cost very much. A Mayor can always
turn ’em loose in the Town Hall and sool the
organ on to them, and if he includes corkscrews in
the programme it’s quite his own affair.
But, after all, I really think that a City
Father who wanted to save_ enough out of his
official screw to buy a breast-pin with would have
to pose as a rabid teetotaller, and force flat
lemonade on his tormentors for the good of their
souls—and his pocket. As a matter of fact, the
mayoral salary should be elastic. For instance, a
bleeding municipality would be only too pleased
to pay a “Jules Mumm ” mayor on the higher
scale—while a Blue Ribbon potentate, of whom
the papers might report, “ Mayor Dash then
ordered ginger-beer to be opened,” ought certainly
to get through at a lower rate.
The mere fact that half the medicine-men in
Sydney recommend people to dress in the new
cellular cloth (the central dep6t is opposite
Hunter-street, in George-street) shows that the
“ faculty ” consider it hygienic—but even if they
didn’t, I think the cloth would tempt people—it
is so nice-looking. The fabric itself is a soft-
looking mesh, canvas pattern, and keeps the
wearer at an even temperature in a l l seasons; and,
unlike most “sanitary” clothing, which is a
bilious drab calculated to make even Venus lose
confidence in herself at the mirror, the new
stuff can be had in all the most becoming colours
in the prism. Every sub-rosa garment in man’s
or woman’s wardrobe —including hose and venti-
lated corsets of Parisian cut—is displayed at the
cellular depdt at most moderate figures, besides
which “ industrious ants ” who cut out and cobble
their own and their male relatives’ under-wear can
buy the cloth by the yard if they like.
Some people put things very plainly—even
hideously. A recent marriage advt. in the
S.M.H. ended with the mystic advice, “See
Thes. XIV., xx.,” or figures to that effect —I have
forgotten the exact numerals. When somebody
looked up the text it was discovered to be “ Pray
for us.” But I think he made a mistake, after all.
I think he really meant “Pray for ME.”
Talking of advts., here is an Esau-ish outbreak
from a Sydney paper :
T ABIES’ Superfluous Hair effectually removed off
face by Lady, ss. stamps.
Here is evidently another way to dispose of our
girls—set them rooting up the moss that spreads
over the visages of the local haul ton —since it
appears to a distinct advantage to have a lady
hovering round the moustaches of feminine society.
And then, in an era of navy shaving like the pre-
sent, perhaps men might prefer to have their
budding mustiveys tweaked out, roots and all, by
rose-leaf finger-tips, instead of being oppressed by
the bother of shaving ? But the way, ladies’
superfluous hair removed off the face strikes me as
being decidedly inadequate. I once knew a
woman who actually couldn’t wear thin hose of
any kind because of the—but the rest of the story
is unavoidably postponed.
I have received from the V.R.C. a most deli-
cately got-up booklet, in die-away tints of grey
and gold and sunset-pink, containing (I mean the
book does) a series of rather smudgy photos, of
the beautiful wild-flower panels done by Mrs.
F. C. Rowan, in the Governor’s pot-plant-haunted
lunch-room at Flemington. It is a classic pam-
uhlet with stiff, old Roman names (supplied from
the inexhaustible well of Von Meuller’s botanical
lore) set forth on the leaf facing the exhibit—
with something of the depressing of the
name-pegs in the Gardens. To my mind the
Latin elaborations spoil the book.
The air has been metaphorically black with
pupils’ concerts lately, and exhausted juniors, in
a fearful state ol frizz and sash-end, have monopo-
lized Sydney platforms, while parents and friends
surged on the ground floor, and the proud mamma
whose darling had a star part brought her tea in a
bag to be sure of a front seat.
Madame Kellerman’s audit took four days to
fag through at the Y.M.C.A., and was the usual
long-drawn-out success, ending in the presentation
of an escritoire to the gifted teacheress. But the
cleverest part about it was the absence of those
flowers which are usually rushed over the foot-
lights to the pupils. There are few things more
absurd than to see a nervous girl who has just
managed to get through the “ Battle of Prague ”
alive, being bouquetted at the finish. It almost
looks as if the crowd was beflowering her for
kindly leaving off !
Mons. Deslouis had a pupil’s concert on the
13th, when some of the singing was very good and
all the items were classic—a presentation of a gold
watch-chain and pendant to Mons. Deslouis
diversifying the programme. But the thing I
enjoyed was the recitation by Marcel Deslouis of
his own poem, “ Que chantent les Cloches.”
Mons Marcel is fresh caught from Paris, and his
recitation was a revelation.
The real troubles of Don Lane, pioneer of the
brand-New Australians, are about to begin, for it
is reported that the Monte Video papers find the
Australian women “exceptionally beautiful and
comely.” Evidently the man in the sombrero
(whom I prophesied about) has already fixed his
bold, black eye on the visitors, and each male
relative is hereby advised to hobble and tether his
own particular bit of muslin until she gets over
the fascinations of the pale-coffee-coloured stranger
in the slouch hat, who calls her “senorita” with
the melodious accent of old Castile, and offers her
pomegranates over the back fence when the old
man’s away.
But we mustn’t overlook the fact that the she-
journalist is rare in Uruguay, so we have no
means of knowing how the male New Australian
is catching on as a professional beauty. Because,
if Monte Videan belledom has been bowled over
by the attractions of the men as badly as the
senors have been by those of the girls, the situa-
tion, in one sense, may not be so bad as it looks.
In another sense, it is probably a good deal worse
than it looks. Monte Video is a big, cosmopolitan
kind of city, where the residents see all manner
uf strange people coming and going, and become
acquainted with all kinds of beauty, so that the
local senor gets the fine edge worn off his suscep-
tibilities. But away up the river, in lonesome
Paraguay, he sees nothing, from the beginning to
the end of the century, save the saddle-coloured
sisterhood of the land, and when the new variety
of girl heaves in sight, the blasB don will probably
cut his way through the back fence with an axe in
his anxiety to get in and propose to her on the
spot.
Do you know what I am waiting for to make
me alter my dark suspicion that women are
responsible for all the titular attractions of Aus-
tralia ? lam waiting for a bachelor or a widower
to rise up, Sir Gingerbread ! Every titled man
who has been basted with the flat side of a sabre
has had a woman edging him on. The two latest
recommendations for “ennobblement ” —Mr. R. J.
Seddon, the Maoriland politician, and Judge
Harding, of Queensland (and a very pretty Judge,
too—l used to think it would be rather nice to be
tried by Judge Harding for some gilt-edged mis-
demeanor and sent to a cell, weeping gracefully
into a lace handkerchief)—are both married, it
almost goes without saying. Mr. Seddon, by the
way, hasn’t been recommended for a knighthood,
after all, but I am,not'going to let that interfere
with my argument. He ought to have been,
rather than leave a lone female out in a great
waste of theory waiting for corroboration to rise
in the east. But for woman’s yearning after
titles and decorations, man’s alleged desire to sell
his soul for the privilege of wearing a ribbon like
a horse’s girth at moments of extreme official
pressure would be a very much abbreviated
emotion. Woman is undoubtedly the gaudiest
sex— but let us be charitable —it the fault
of her training. Women are brought up to admire
ribbons.
The story goes of one titled lady, at present in
Australia, that, during the voyage thitherward,
her trick was to chew (women don’t smoke, they
think they do, but just watch how they gobble a
cigarette) little paper dissipations by the bundle,
and one evening she sallied on deck to enjoy a
whiff on the poop. She hadn’t been puffing five
minutes before the' quarter-master, or some such
brass-buttoned tin-god, came briskly up : “You
must not smoke here, madam. If you want to
smoke, you must go into the smoking-room or
abaft there !” The lady smoked in her own state-
room after that —from which such clouds of dust
and ashes billowed during her occasional quiet
whiff, that the passengers christened her the
“ Kippered Herring ” for the rest of the voyage.
Talking of smoking at sea. lam told that two
Sydney society ladies, who went Bull-wards not
so long ago, chewed up one hundred boxes of
cigarettes between them on the voyage ! But the
most Christian construction to put upon this is
that the girl, who always has a cigarette in her
lips, doesn’t do much k flirting, I mean.
The statement—in a “ ’Ome ” journal—that in
thirty years’ of hard praying and cocoanut tithe-
snatching there have been only three converts to
the European notion of Christianity among the
muoh-talked-of Matabeles, reminds me —though I
really can’t trace why —of a certain Australian
young lady, daughter of a once-famous N.S. W.
sculler, who got engaged not long ago to a banker
who was not of her own religious persuasion—he
was an Anglican and she was of the Vatican.
Thereupon the young lady set diligently to
work to save her Gussie’s immortal soul from the
parsonical stockyard and lure him into the sheep-
fold of Father O’Rourke. Instead of tickling
Gussie under the chin and curling his moustache,
as the average engaged girl does, she spent every
opportunity in arguing about transubstantiation
and doxology, and trying to encourage her best
young man into committing scissors—or schism,
or whatever it is.
At last, her indefatigability won the day.
Gussie flouted the bishop and adopted the Pope,
and his fiancee went about with the exalted ex-
pression of one who has fought a good fight and
got the scalps thrown in. But, behold !it soon
appeared that Gussie was converted very badly
indeed, so badly that at last he broke it to his
promised bride that he really must give up all
earthly things and get him to a friary ! And he
suited the action to the word by making enquiries
how to enter the priesthood the very next day.
The moral of this strictly true story seems to me
to be —never convert a lover to any faith that lias
celibacy in the recipe.
“Ouida’s” mother is dead, and Queen Victoria
has sent a message of condolence to the orphan
By the death of her ma Omda is left without a
chaperone, for Madame de la Ramee always lived
with her gifted daughter.
Which reminds me that a Melbourne girl, just
returned from a Continental tour, told me a few
reminiscences of a certain gifted novelist, who is
supposed to have simply coined money with her
pen. She —I mean the Melbourne girl happened
to be at the same hotel where the novelist and her
mother were putting up. Hearing the sound of a
“regular father of a scolding” emanating from an
adjoining room, she interviewed the landlord, who
simply said : “It is Mdlle remonstrating
with Madame her mother!” Becoming more
garrulous he confessed that the talented authoress
wasn’t as regular as clock-work with her hotel-
bills, but squandered money for everything else
first, and often relied on the generosity of a pass-
ing Duke or Duchess to get her out of pawn. At
one hotel they had to take the doors of her apart-
ments off to induce her to quit the premises.
“ No one is a hero to his—landlord.’’
A fashionable Sydney camera-man has hit upon
a clever way of attracting business. He has
rented a shop-window on the Block and filled it
with cartes of society women, leavened by pic-
tures of Charles Ryley and one or two other male
beauties. In the hope that her smirking counten-
ance may be plac 'd in the front row, so that
Augustus may admire it on Saturday mornings,
the suburban girl is almost sure to rush the—l
forget the name—studios. By the way, a Melb.
photographer exhibits a portrait of Nellie Stewart
which you can’t see for the flies that have yielded
up the ghost between the picture and the pane.
As there are no flies on Nellie, the artist is hereby
advised to pass a feather duster round exhibit A,
if only for the sake of eternal fitness.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The attempted dynamite outrage in the
French Assembly is still another proof that there
are a great number of very bad shots in this
world. The anarchist had a whole Legislature
for a target when he threw his little pot of com-
bustibles. He was overhead, and only needed to
drop it and let things take their course. It was
all just about as easy as hitting a mountain with
a brick. But, while waving his bomb needlessly
about his head before letting fly, he struck it
against something and it exploded in mid-air, and
wrecked the gallery instead of the premise#
below, and another great sensation went
wrong. The Barcelona anarchist who aimed
his package of dynamite at the _ head _of
Marshal Campos was another case in point.
The gaudy Marshal’s cocked hat made a
splendid target, and the assailant took a pot-shot
at it from a range of a few feet —and missed.
Anarchists always miss, somehow. A school-boy
aiming his dictionary at a hen is ten times more
destructive to the object aimed at. It is the man
standing by that the dynamiter always blows into
six or more pieces.
Bread and Violets.
The bread called life r-so cold, so very cold,
With robes of desolation fold on fold,^
So bare and dry and barren ! O, my God .
Why was I born a singer—not a clod ?
Better it were in the rush and the whir,
Better it were in the crest of the wrong,
To find a brief joy in the crush and the stir
Than to ache with despair and to pour out s
song,
So hopelessly longing for—what?
Violets called love. Sweet, purple, and warm,
Innocent, too, as the world well says,
Coyer, perchance, than a woman’s form,
Breasting the thorns of a deep, dread maze,
Which maze call “ love ” —of another kind
From the violet love of a violet year ;
But which shall we choose? The body or mind,
Violets —or roses? Safety—or fear?
• • • •
Roses —and wine in a bright golden cup —
Roses, all crimson, but dry-leaved and hot;
Wine, when the sediment stirs and comes up
When sparkle of bubble has fled and is not;
Or violets—and bread ! Cool violets, all wet
With the innocent dew of an innocent sky,
Their perfumes forever more pungently yet
Arise to caress in the sound of a sigh,
Peacefully, calmly, no riot of love
To mock with its madness the Heaven above !
Then, say which love shall we cherish or dread?
The roses —and wine ? Or the violets - and bread ?

Though baby-farmer Knorr has been sen-
tenced to death in Melbourne, it is not likely
that she will be hanged. No woman has been
hanged in Victoria for about 30 years. This is
one of lovely woman’s wrongs, and points out a
bitterly distinct inequality with the lordly male
whose neck is sufficiently coarse and hairy to be
broken officially.
Mrs, William Ferguson, who came out to
South Australia in the ship which brought the
first Governor, Captain John Hindmarsh, and
witnessed the proclamation of the province under
the old gum-tree at Holdfast Bay, died last week,
an octogenarian.
A grin of derision went round the Court
when Chief Justice Darley, in sentencing solicitor
Broad to five years’ penal servitude, said that he
was thankful there were not many solicitors in
this province who indulged in dishonest practices.
His Honor probably meant that few solicitors
were found out indulging in dishonest practices.
In Cochin-China the imperial treasures
are deposited in hollow tree trunks, and anchored
out in a huge tank in the centre of the royal
palace with 20 crocodiles to keep a dull, fishlike
eye on the property. No one can embezzle the
treasure without first killing the crocodiles, conse-
quently there has never been a shortage within
the memory of any living man. Some day Aus-
tralian bank shareholders will drop to the advan-
tages of this method, and insist on the reserve-
fund being kept in a tank likewise. A crocodile
is a lot more reliable than an auditor any day.
The long-forgotten Dora Dura blacks have
been heard from again, in the vicinity of Bunda-
berg (Q.), where one of them has been run down,
fallen upon, badly flattened, and captured by a
local policeman. The other got away, but after
this unlooked-for success he will probably be pur-
sued simultaneously in eighty-four different
localities scattered all over this continent, and be
arrested in large quantities throughout Australia.
The squashed and fallen-upon aboriginal now in
custody is being taken to Victoria for trial. The
Dora Dora blacks have had an interesting history.
Nobody saw them commit their famous homicide,
except the victim himself, and he died leaving be-
hind him a general description which might fit
almost any two niggers in this continent. The
only circumstance by which they could possibly
be identified was the fact that there were two of
them together, therefore the police and the general
public have ever since consistently chased every
pair of niggers that were heard of. Probably 40
separate pairs of niggers have been pursued and
have got away in the course of the hunt. The
forty-first pair, however, were short-winded, and
Nemesis overtook them as it always does overtake
the corpulent aborigine with brief and transitory
legs. Now that one has been captured the prin-
cipal means by which the other can be identi-
fied is tlie fact that he is alone, therefore there is
going to be a bad time for solitary natives during
the next few months.
The point raised as to the validity of the
N.S.W. Electoral Act of ’93 is one that does much
credit to the ingenuity of its discoverer. The
whole question is whether the Assembly has dele-
gated, or can delegate, to the electoral district
commissioners its power of “establishing new and
other” electoral divisions of the province. It
is contended that the commissioners exercised a
delegated power in altering the boundaries of the
constituencies, and that as these alterations were
not subsequently enacted by Parliament the alter-
ations are invalid. And the awkwardness of the
whole matter is that if the point is a good
one, the Act is still valid as to the repeal of the
former Act, so that neither Act is available for re-
election of members. But the A.G. will probably
decide that there is nothing in the point. The
Assembly did “establish new and other” elec-
toral divisions, the boundaries of those electorates
being such as the commissioners should fix. The
commissioners did not exercise a delegated power
to establish electorates any more than a policeman
who collects the roll does. If the A.G., however,
should think otherwise a one-section bill run
through the House, when Parliament meets, will
fix the thing up, and failing that, Premier Repub-
lican Dibbs will have a lovely chance of trying
Government on strictly damn-the-Constitution-
Act lines.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
t Blackham says Turner “ gob the needle ” because
he was often sent in last at the commencement of the
tour, when he was completely off owing to ill-health.
He is also of opinion that the English fast bowlers com-
pletely demoralised the Australians, who are too much
used to tricky slow bowlers.
* * »
Ooningham, who was generally a bystander,
who had no provincial prejudices in favour of particular
men, no brother to “bear up” for, and who “never
drank a drop during the whole of the tour,” seems to be
the most reliable authority on the conduct of the bicker-
ing “ Hoys.” Coningham’s general grievance tends to
make his opinion sacred, and he, by the way, has his best
word for the harassed manager. The manager returns
the compliment. They were comrades in sorrow,
* » *
Taking it all round, however, the saddest feature
about the return of the Australian Eleven is the great
mass of explanation which commenced as soon as the
team landed, and which has raged at intervals ever since.
And, after the explanation, the saddest thing is the want
of explanation. The team came ashore silently and with-
out any semblance of an ovation, and went its lonesome
way, mostly b3 r twos, no one man, apparently, being on
cordial terms with more than one other man and, in some
cases, he didn't appear to he on very cordial terms even
with him. The majority of members, when interviewed,
seem to have been too depressed even to complain
violently. But they insinuated things about each other
in a dreary, bilious, dyspeptic fashion. Some of them
“ weren’t prepared to say ” that one member’s nose
hadn’t been pulled, or that another member hadn’t used
unprintable language, or that somebody did n’t want to fight
somebody else under lamentable circumstances, but
nobody denied anything with much vigour. It was
stated, in a general sort of way, that the team wasn’t
quite so drunk as was commonly supposed,.hut if it didn’t
over-drink itself it probably over-ate itself instead. Its
present attitude seems to suggest great masses of un-
digested food, more than anything else, as the principal
disturbing influence.
# # *
Rising young cricketers are hereby advised to
join the Y.M.C.A. There will be a fearful demand for
sobriety and Christian gentleness when the next Aus-
tralian Eleven is chosen, and the batsman who says ids
prayers every night will assuredly be picked before the
comparative worldling who bustles through them on
Sunday nights only'. Nor will anything in the shape of a
“demon ” bowler stand a chance of a place in the team.
Young men must learn to bowl earnestly and straight,
and with the fear of the Lord before their eyes, instead of
putting “devil" into it.
* # #
The late Spring meeting of the V.R.C., which
was at the time described as a financial success by fatuous
sporting reporters, proves to have been a failure even
when compared with the disastrous Mud Carnival of 1892.
Consequently, a further cutting down of stakes is an-
nounced, and the glory of a £lO,OOO Melt). Cup may be
considered a thing of the past. This year the V.R.C. had
profitable weather for Derby, Cup, Oaks and Steeple, yet
the four days’ receipts fell about £28,000 below the
champion record of 1888. A speedy improvement in busi-
ness is out of the question. The big meeting has declined,
proportionately, to a much greater extent than the more
purely horsey gatherings in March, May and July, and
here we have a convincing proof that the general public,
the raw, amateur race-goers, are becoming “full-up” of
the so-called sport provided for them nowadays. Press
commentators on racing matters ape mostly incapable of
tellifur the truth, so this extraordinary drop in Melh. Cup
attendances is attributed solely to bad times and “ pre-
vailing depression.” As a matter of fact, the temptation
to have a hit upon a horse is one of the last things to be
killed by adversity.
The thousands of men who have lately sworn-off
their old habit of “holiday” betting at Flemington are
not all of them unable to afford the luxury of a wager.
Scarcity of funds is, of course, an important factor in the
change which has come over the V.R.C. dream, but the
awful decay of Turf decency has much more to do with
the matter. For a good while past The Bulletin has
said that the V.R.C., by allowing folks in general to he
swindled beyond all reasonable endurance, would surely
kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. The goose afore-
said is a hacker, and not a lajer, but the figure of speech
should he intelligible, nevertheless. The oft-plucked
bird seems to have the death-mark on its brow, and if
racing “ form ” much longer remains as impudently dis-
honest as at present, the goose will die withouta struggle.
V.R.C. stewards may spare themselves the trouble of con-
sidering ways and means of luring their lost patrons
back to Flemington, unless they can officially guarantee
a fair percentage of fair runs for the public money. Those
careless guardians of sporting morality may abandon the
idea that their gate-money will improve wnen “things
begin to come round.” Things must become a deal more
square in the racing world ere the disgusted punters will
want to visit it again. James White was the V.R.C.’s
best friend. He kept the public well supplied with
favourites that tried to win, and frequently succeeded in
the attempt. Now that White is dead, the burden of
roguery is more than racing can bear.
* * *
One of the incidents of the last Melb. Cup :
When the wife of a well-known owner of race-horses saw
hubby’s animal beaten even for a place, she straight-
way tied herself up in a hysterical attack and cleared
about space around her in 10 sec. This is about
the only instance on record where it could be safely
assumed a race was run absolutely on the square.
# # *
The Bulletin has received the following
printed slip, numbers the like of which have been sent
abroad throughout the Australian provinces; “Notice to
Subscribers of Tattersall’s Monster Consultations. In
consequence of the difficulties which have recently arisen
in connection with the transmission of letters, I have
been compelled to alter my address. Until further notice
please address -J. H. Chisholm, General Post Office,
Sydney, N.S.W.” The generally accepted idea is that all
letters with reference to Tatbersall’s consultations should
be addressed (o Telegraph Chambers, Brisbane. Intending
subscribers should bear this in mind when reading the
above, which is evidently another of the mysteries of the
Australian turf.
# * *
In the J. J. Miller prosecution, dismissed in
Melb. recently, the Bench called W. Miles, clerk of the
V.R.C., to swear that the Melb. Cup was really raced for.
Which reminds us that Sydney Banco Court does not
officially know what the Melh. Cup is, and hesitates to
infer without evidence that it is a kind of horse-race. It
was a Sydney judge, too, who interrupted counsel by
saving, “ Well, we have heard a great deal about big totes
and little totes, but I should like to know how big a big
tote is. Would it go into a room as big as this court?”
And not a barrister in the case was quite certain whether
it would.

lieved to be the record of Australia. The total score of
his side was 621. Hill’s father is a cricketer, and a good
eleven, including a daughter who bats vigorously, could
be put into the field by the family.

The latest boating fatality on Sydney Harbour
—the sinking of the Ripple and the loss of seven persons
out of the thirteen on board—arose, so far as appears
from the evidence up to date, piincipally through the
ghastly architecture of the foundered vessel. According
to regulations, every sailing-boat which is kept for hire
must be provided with corks or air tight chambers or
some other means of flotation, sufficient, in case of
accident, to counterbalance the weight of the centre-
board and ballast, and keep her afloat even when full of
water. Therefore, the ordinary sailing craft will float
upright and full of water, upside-down, sideways, or
practically anyhow. The regulation, however, as per the
pig-headed statoots of New South Wales, does not apply
to private boats. The Ripple, with her ton, or ton-and-a-
nalf, of lead, on her keel, had just as much chance,
when once she filled with water, as an iron stove
or a cartload of loose bricks. For all practical purposes,
she might as well have been a grindstone turned loose on
the surface of the Pacific. The sinking of the Ripple
isn’t a commentary on the consequences of “Sabbath
desecration,” though many a profound and nasal moral
will doubtless be drawn from the disaster. Nor is it a
confirmation of the old-fashioned “thirteen superstition.”
It is merely a solid proof that 20cwt. of unsupported lead
is an eminently sinkable material at all times. Vessels of
the Ripple kind are mere death-traps when anything goes
wrong. Ernest Vider, the well-known Sydney cyclist, is
among the drowned. His body and that of another of the
crew are unaccounted for. Considering the shark-infested
slate of these waters, it is quite possible that they' may
both remain unaccounted for till the Day of Resurrection.

Tarcoola is handicapped .at 9st. 91bs. for the
Bagot Handicap at next V.R.C. meeting. The lucky Cup
winner has already started for three Bagots—carrying
Bst. 4lbs. on two occasions, and a couple of pounds less at
his third unsuccessful attempt—so he doesn’t seem to
have a ghost of a chance this time.

The finish between Woodward and Bucknall for
the M.B.C.’s Austral Wheel Race was very fine, the limit
man, although “collared” some distance from home,
being beaten by half a length only. Tub Bulletin's
“ tip” of Bucknall, Jorgenson and Elliott was fairly near
the mark for the whole day’s racing, inasmuch as the
N.S.W. man pulled off the One-and a-Half Mile in bis
(second) class, and Elliott scored a heat in the One Mile
Open.
# * *
Bookmakers, as usual of late, were more or less
excluded from the M. 8.0. meeting. One determined
individual was turned off the ground eleven times, but he
paid his twelfth entrance fee, found a means of making
Ids quiet little book, and cleared £BO on the day. The
reward of perseverance.

The Vic. Railway Department has offered to
consider the propriety of reducing fares to suburban
race-meetings as soon as the racing authorities are ready
to push trade by reducing their charges for admission. It
is thus that the State works to suppress betting.
A GREAT SPECIALIST.
A MAN FOR THE PEOPLE.
An important discovery, which is exciting con-
siderable attention among the general public
throughout the country, has been made by Dr.
P. Stanich, Aural Surgeon, the well-known
specialist of Sydney. It is the cure of the nasal
complaint, technically called Ozcena, which
generally results from catarrh or cold in the
head, an affection hitherto considered, to a
great extent, incurable. Ozcena is a stinking
ulceration of the membrane, destroys the nose,
and renders a person’s features most unsightly.
Dr. Stanich’s cures have been so effectual that
particulars of discovery have been spread all
over the Australian continent. This discovery
justifies the reputation of Dr. Stanich as a
scientist of front rank. As a specialist in diseases
of the ear, he has long enjoyed the highest
position in the country, receiving high written
acknowledgments from the Right Honorable
Sir Alfred Stephen, Lord Loftus, and other
prominent citizens, whom he has benefited.
Like all able men, Dr. Stanich is a philanthropist,
as he administers to hundreds of poor patients of
all grades and ages, without charge, at his consult-
ing rooms at 145 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, which
is a busy spot at almost all hours. Visitors from
all parts of N. S. Wales and other colonies are
found there, as testimony to his great reput-
ation, while inquiries by post on almost all
kinds of complaints connected with the head and
throat pour in on him from all quarters.

Observations moored to the frock of a

Henry Copeland, N.S.W. Minister for
Lands, has explicitly explained to the Nat. Ass.
what he would have done with his Land Bill
hadn’t he kept on doing something else with other
things. Copeland would have extended time to
squatters and given them vested rights in water
and fencing improvements ; would have facilitated
homestead purchases ; and established a scheme of
28 years’ leases. Echoes of distant chorus, com-
mingled with fumes of brimstone :
Not, oh ! not, my son,
This our present stew ;
Had we only done
What we meant to do.
Same’in every sphere are
Things that history mentions ;
All the tracks to here are
Paved with good intentions.
Would it be senility, or a smart electioneer-
ing trick, if old Parkes were to throw up his
knighth/jod? He could probably easily assume it
again. Dibbs threw up his republicanism.
Yarney Parkes, M.P. (N.S. W.), says that
it is impossible to “sink the fiscal issue.” His
good old man has managed to sink his own fiscal
issue pretty successfully all his life.
The latest political trouble in N.S.W. is
the professed discovery, by somebody or other,
that the one-man-one-vote principle is contrary to
the “ constitooshun,” and that, in consequence,
something will have to be done by the British
Parliament before the new system can come into
force. This should be a grand opportunity for
Dibbs, who loves to meet an apparently insuper-
able obstacle, so that he can rush at it and put his
head through it. The spectacle of Dibbs cheer-
fully damning the Constitution and going straight
ahead would be inspiriting.
Last week a demented Hindoo, armed
with a huge piece of artillery, called at the
N.S.W. Premier’s office, and was arrested in time
to prevent a tragedy. G. R. Dibbs afterwards
remarked to an interviewer : “It is consoling at
all events to know that a man can die only once.”
Which, considering that the weapon wasn’t
loaded, and was so rusty and so m-uch out of
date that it probably couldn’t have been fired,
and that the Hindoo, apparently, didn’t know
how to load it in any case, and that he was seized
before he got within several corridors of his victim,
and that he was a poor, weak little man whom
Dibbs could have bowled over with a book while
he was still fumbling with his antiquated bombard,
sounds like an altogether superfluous piece of
philosophy.
A wasteful expenditure of powder and
ball, under the pretence of teaching the N.S.W.
artillery how to repel an attack upon Sydney by
two hostile cruisers and their torpedo-boats, prac-
tically took the form of a bombardment of
Watson’s Bay. One officer followed the moving
target so zealously that his shot ricochetted over
yachts and launches, splashed among rocks, and,
in some instances, ploughed through land in the
immediate vicinity of houses, to the terror of the
inhabitants. Major-General Hutton, greatly
enraged at the spectacle, gave the order to cease
firing. An officer ran to what appeared to be a
telephone, and went through the dumb show
business of conveying the General’s orders to the
zealous gunner ; but whether the telephone circuit
had been broken, or whether (as was merrily
stated after all danger was over) the wire had
forgetfully never been connected at all are
matters that require explanation. Strenuous
efforts were made to hoodwink the Sydney press,
and these appear to have been partially successful.
The long-haired Caldwell, M.P., wants
S.A. Legislature to enact that Ministers of the
Crown shall in future be personally liable for any
direct loss to revenue occasioned through neglect,
mismanagement or “ misinterpretation of legisla-
tion.” In the event of an action against the
Government being successful, the Minister, whose
department is involved, is to be liable for the
amount involved and costs. Finally, no Minister
who has been once convicted under the proposed
system shall ever hold office again. Considering
that the Ministers who came to grief under this
clause would only do it through want of brains,
and brains are hereditary, Caldwell might con-
sider the advisability of taking action against the
politician’s parents unless they can prove an alibi.
Dufchie, the Tory member for Wellington
(M.L.), is a man with a temper which won’t bear
close inspection, and during the late campaign it
was a favourite amusement to rouse up the slum-
bering ironmonger. At one of his meetings he
was obviously making a great effort to preserve
his calmness. One fatuous elector asked if the
candidate would dance a hornpipe if returned ;
another inquired if he had a good tip for the next
races; and a third wanted to know if he was in
favour of young men taking their girls into the
Botanic Gardens after 4 p.m? Duthie swelled up
visibly with indignation, but still ho preserved a
semblance of composure. Then two electors got
up together, one inquiring if the candidate
would take the income-tax off empty packing-
eases, and the other wanting to know if he was
in favour of making every teetotaller drink two
quarts of cold water every morning and making
Robert Stout drink three quarts? And then
something burst audibly in Duthie’s head, and he
let go his hold on himself, and blew up with a loud
report, and said: “ !! !

Ballade of a Dying Race.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
Strange land beneath the Southern skies;
Strange race whose sun seems on the wane,
That from the white race shrinks and flies,
As flies the night at morning’s reign ;
Alike ye treat with dull disdain,
The white man’s God, or Chinese Joss,
Sleep, ease, and food your highest gain,
Doomed Children of the Southern Cross.
Ah, sad and soft Australian eyes,
Eyes dark with depth of wistful pain ;
What mournful memory in them lies
Of days that come not back again ?
Ere yet the white man crossed your main,
Ere yet his gain had proved your loss,
Were there brave days of love and Fame,
Doomed Children of the Southern Cross?
Harsh Fate to you so much denies,
Your lives such little joys contain,
Your aims above the brute scarce rise ;
Poor darkened souls, poor feeble brain,
Seek out some wild, free bush domain,
A kingdom sweet of fern and moss,
There free a little while remain
Doomed Children of the Southern Cross.
Envoi :
Yet shall ye hear in drip of rain,
In moan of winds that dead leaves toss
A sad and ceaseless low refrain,
“ Doomed Children of the Southern Cross.”
CRAIG ELLACHIE.
Dear Bulletin, Your Melb. corres
pondent, “Nem.,” who boasts of living on Bd. a
day is an extravagant epicure and will come to
want some day. Let him take to “ burgoo ”
and sheep’s liver, and put 2s. a week in some
consumptive bank against his old age. A man
camped under a potato sack “ fly ” in Albert
Park told me that he had lived on this sumptuous
fare for five weeks at a cost of half-a-sov. Some-
times he begged the liver “for the oat.”—Yours,
Snell.
Dear Bulletin, —Some years ago, “Jimmy
the Malay,” now residing at Port Moresby
(N.Q.), was taken out of his canoe by a huge
alligator, which got him down on the river
bottom and sat on his chest. Jimmy, however,
with great presence of mind, “gouged” the
reptile’s eyes and it scooted, and James rose to
the surface in great haste, and regained his canoe
and composure. Beyond a slight shook to the
system and a few bruises he was little the worse
for his adventure. This statement isn’t the reck-
less lie it appears. The alligator, although it’s
teeth are made something after the cross-cut saw
principle—only more so—does not seize its victim
and chew him up on the spot, as is generally sup-
posed. Instead, it drags him gently to the
bottom, stands on him till he drowns, and then
digs a hole in a mud-bank and buries him till he gets
gamey. Then it calls around in a week or so and
“ scoffs ” him without mastication.—Yours, Bak-
TRAX.
Editor Bulletin, — I beg you tell the
manager to discontinue sending your paper, as it
is utterly impossible to get it delivered at Cool-
gardie. I have received six Bulletins while here,
and may consider myself lucky. At Coolgardie a
tent serves for the post-office, and the mail, when
it arrives, is dumped down on the ground outside
and everyone helps himself. Last mail I secured
two of my papers just as another man was in the
act of walking off with them. I saw other men
taking papers which did not belong to them.
Reading the W.A. papers, you would think it
was all gold here, but nothing could be more mis-
leading. Nowhere have I had a harder job to get
a few dwts. than here. For every one who gets
gold here there are hundreds who get nothing.
All the glowing accounts come from the lease-
holders, who naturally want to boom the place.
The Government, too, seem to be bent on making
money out of the field, seeing that they charge 3d.
a gallon for water as salt as the sea. Altogether
there are about 800 fossickers here, some getting a
few dwts. a week, more getting nothing. I, my-
self, have got 2|dwts. in a fortnight, and if rain
does not soon come I’ll have to move on to I know
not where. Hundreds of others are in exactly
the same predicament. So you will see that this
hell-hole is not exactly what the boomers paint it.
—O. Sodergkken, Coolgardie, Nov, 3, 1893.

The case of the forger lately sentenced to
ten years at Newcastle, N.S. W., was a ghastly
exhibition of the detective incapacity of the
police. Twelve years ago the prisoner (a coal-
trimmer by trade who dabbled in photography)
became a suspect, and though, as was afterwards
learnt, he periodically disposed of numbers of
forged notes, the police could never obtain the
slightest scintilla of evidence against him. When
the Narrabri utterer was arrested a P.O. order was
found on him addressed to the forger’s wife, and,
accordingly, the Newcastle police swooped on the
latter’s residence, where, after a scrupulous
search, they failed to find any article of an in-
criminating nature. A week later they again
searched, with the same annoying result. On a
third visit, however, they found, stowed away
among a number of dust«or »-d, discarded
negatives, one which faintly »h >wed on one
corner part of the impress or a B.N.S.W.
i>s note. Conviction ensued. The trial was
chiefly remarkable for the manner in which the
prisoner broke up the photographic expert im-
ported by the prosecution. Several hundred pieces
of paper, cut exactly to the size of a bank-note,
were found on the premises of prisoner, and the
expert deposed that such a size was never under
any circumstances used in legitimate art. Prisoner
thereupon handed in a printed trade-list in which
were several quotations for that size of sheet.
Some of the paper was then handed to the expert,
and he was asked it it were possible that it could
have been so treated photographically that by
merely damping it a picture would immediately
appear upon the blank paper. The expert dog-
matically deposed that no such process had been
discovered. Accused then damped two of the
sheets, on one of which immediately appeared a
photo, of Lily Langtry, and on the other a photo,
of the courthouse in which the trial was being
conducted.
The other day the Australian dailies
announced that Gueen Victoria had sent 140
bottles of wine to the London hospitals. It is now
asserted in the English press that the wine was
sour and had to be thrown away.
A correspondent writes from one of the
Russian Asiatic provinces to the Victorian Post-
master-General ; “ That wonderful projectile, the
boomerang, interests me so much that I would
like you to send me one. I will forward the
money with pleasure.” The next thing will be a
cablegram: “ Boomerang hurled at the Czar.”
A N.S.W. police-station has been struck
by lightning. Well, Ananias was also struck by
lightning. Which recalls that the Synnott Bros.,
who used to run an abusive evening paper in
Barataria, were fond of heading articles about
their loathsome contemporary, “ Annanias
Again.” “Why do you spell Ananias with a
double ‘n’?” asked a stranger one day of the
chief reporter. “ Well,’’replied the reporter who
cordially detested his employers, “because there’s
a double ‘ n ’ in Synnott. ”
Dear Bulletin, —Melbourne Age reports
an alleged “marvellous” case of a girl in an up
country town, who daily sheds splinters concern-
ing which she can give no explanation. It is
strange nobody seems to diagnose so simple an
affair. Many times has the writer seen men, some
of whose ancestors must have been in the timber
trade, shedding sawdust through their pores.
Lovy diet and excessive exposure to the air appear
specially favourable to this phenomenon. Take a
dozen Domain dossers at random, strip them and
then brush their skins with a hard clothes brush,
and see if in several instances sawdust doesn’t
come off in packets. The girl’s father has pro-
bably a near relation who was a sawyer, and the
inhaled wood-fibres which he transmitted have
concentrated in her system through some unusual
mental and physical combinations, and produced
the above result. Nice girl to hug in a hurry, by
the way.—Yours, C.J.

The Boodlers’ Requiem.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They grew in beauty side by side,
They shore one land with glee ;
Their gaols are scattered far and wide,
From Perth to Coral Sea.
They took the same old public in,
. They stole the widow’s cow;
The took the same poor orphan’s tin—
Where are those dollars now ?
The first defaulter wandered West,
A godly man and true ;
lie tied his colours round his breast,
He tied our assets, too.
The sea—the blue, lone sea—hatn one,
He lies—he lieth low ;
His vessel made a famous run
To far Fernando Po.
One bears a chain with cheerless clank
Upon his lily hand;
And one reposeth on a plank—
The last of that bright band.
And, parted thus, they rest who wore
The same old greasy smile,
Whose eyes with pious tears ran o’er,
Whose cheeks were fat with guile.
They’re gone who stole the children’s bread
And pawned the pauper’s gear ;
And o’er each dear departed head
The vulture drops a tear.

Judge Molesworth ; “I thought ‘ltalian
wine’ was known as whisky!” “No, your
Honor,” said Objector Gaunson triumphantly,
having struck something he really did know ;
“ whisky is Presbyterian wine ! ”
Bill Cody, the Wild West man, has bought
a fine house in North Platte, Neb., “near the
spot where he killed his first Indian.” Which
recalls the good Australian ecclesiastic (he who
“buried his heart” with his wife and then married
another lady half her age) asking a Q. squatter
how it was that while the surrounding country
was so sterile the station-garden was so fruitful—
“ Niggers, Bishop, niggers. Eleven niggers in
that quarter-acre. We buried all we could find
there. The rest of the ’s died in the ranges.”
Morals: Habits which change every 50
years or so.
“The Pilgrim Mothers are quite over-
looked.” — American.
“In Memoriam of Our Beloved Em-
ployer.” Odd sort of a testimonial, exhibited in
a Melb. window, signed by a number of men.
The pigeon-English Bible, issued in 1830,
for the Chinese, is outrageously funny. Hardly
one can be got now, for it was bought up like a
Punch.
The Earl of Pembroke, well-known as
joint-author of that charming book “South Sea

Louis Becke’s forthcoming book of Polynesian
tales and sketches from The Bulletin. It will

Dear Bulletin, —I am out of a billet and
want to go out and find a chunk of ambergris. I
was told that, some time this year, a party of shore
whalemen in Tasmania got 18501bs. from the
carcase of a whale that drifted ashore. Can you
give me any particulars? The matter was alluded
to in the daily papers. N.B.—Please tell me in
what part of the whale the ambergris is located. —
Yours, &c., Clericus Bal^ena.
The latest “ bomb ” found in London, just
in time to prevent a hideous explosion, now proves
to be an ancient shell, dug up on the Italian
battlefield of Genestrello, and preserved as a
curiosity. The owner lost the run of it while
shifting his furniture to new quarters; then a
policeman found it, and the conspiracy was
promptly cabled all over the earth.
In England, according to last census, there
are 60,000 more married women than married
men. At first sight it seems difficult to under-
stand how any woman can be married without a
corresponding man to assist her, but the assump-
tion is that the 60,000 are really old maids, who
call themselves “Mrs.” to avoid the obloquy
which attaches to the bony spinster when she gets
to be over 43.
A toilet luxury in every respect, Ayer’s Hair
Vigor never fails to restore the youthful freshness
and color to faded and gray hair. It also
eradicates dandruff and prevents the hair from
falling.

screed on the subject. ..“Eliza”: Your prose is better

richly decorated with fresh gore “ S.C.” : Will use in
another issue “Octopus”: If you had as many arms
as an octopus should have, and worked 30 hours a day
for six years, you could not write a worse love-story than
the one you have sent. As Parkes would say, it is
“entirely unprecedented.” “Elliot Dene”: Nob

that its ideas are worse than its rhyme, and its rhyme is

The present political situation in N.S. W-
is just this ; Premier Dibbs will probably have to
go out of office because he approved of Attorney-
General Barton holding private briefs against the
State. Then Eyeglass Reid, who tacitly approved
of Burton’s proceeding until he found that there
was political capital to be made out of it, will
come in. Barton himself has quitted the Cabinet
because he asserted his right to hold briefs
practically against the Treasury; and if a
Foreign-trade Cabinet is formed it will probably
include Want, Q. 0., who, when Attorney-General,
did almost exactly the same thing. Yet, under
the beautiful system of Government by Contra-
diction, the country’s choice practically lies
between Dibbs and Reid, and if it doesn’t like
the one it has simply got to exchange him for the
other.
The latest Victorian Bible-in-schools depu-
tation claimed to represent 200,000 persons who
were solid in demanding the abolition of “godless
education.” This is unwonted moderation on the
part of the sectarians, who generally claim to
speak for 75 per cent, of the population at the
lowest estimate. And though one election passes
after another, and their most frantic efforts seldom
result in the return of half-a-dozen members to the
Assembly,they always turn up again on the door-
mat of the Education Department with the same
old assertion that they represent the great mass of
the nation, and “ godless education ” is doomed.
The front of a 14-storey coffee-palace is a small
thing compared to the front of a sectarian depu-
tation.
Ex-Governor Jersey, now that he has gone
“Home,” has begun to fire oft the usual heavy
platitudes about N.S. Wales. The following
choice samples lately arrived by cable :
Lord Jersey advocates the carrying out of a thorough
system of irrigation in N.S. Wales.
Lord Jersey predicts a great destiny for Australia.
Lord Jersey states that under sagacious leaders trades-
unionism is not dangerous, but he advises a more prudent
recognition of the rights of capital.
Lord Jersey referred to the general condition of the
colony, and said that, with a proper system of irrigation,
the colony would eventually become a"great p ople.
The latter statement is about as brilliant as if
Jersey had said that, with a proper system of
bullock-driving, a three-rail fence would eventually
become a cathedral. And the rest only amounts to
a solemn assurapee that there are milestones on
the Dover road. Also, deah friends, rain is wet
and generally falls downward in the shape of
damp moisture descending in a liquid form
vertically with a tendency to arrive at a lower
position than it previously occupied. It is getting
to be very dreadful—that weary statement that
somebody has stood himself up on his two soles
and said that Australia has a great destiny before
it. What is a destiny, anyhow ? And why is it
that, though every country is always going to
have one, no country ever seems to have its
destiny visibly on hand? Also, is there any
destiny at all, and if there is should it be picked
green or allowed to ripen on the tree ? *
While Providence has been good to the
tobacco growers of New South Wales by giving
them climate and soil admirably adapted to the
cultivation of the leaf, it has left them to contend
with an unprofitable market. And a 1 though
much enthusiasm has been shown by politicians of
the kind who want to settle the people on the land,
nothing appears to have been really done, except
by Mcßurney, Wallis, and Co., who lately sent a
trial shipment of N.S.W. leaf to Canada by the
Arawa. The Hon. Mackenzie Bowell will, it is
stated, obtain an expert’s opinion on the leaf. If
the experiment proves successful, tobacco growers
will have reason to be grateful to the enterprising
firm that makes the venture.
M'Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
Wool.—At our usual weekly sale ((he seventh of the
season) held yesterday at the Wool Exchange the
attendance of buyers was again very large and competi-
tion for all descriptions extremely vigorous; indeed,
biddings were so spirited that it was difficult for the
auctioneer to pick out the highest bidder. Bellies, pieces
and locks continue to sell well, as also “star lots." Our
catalogue comprised wool from the northern, southern,
and western districts, and as there were few high reserves
to hamper the sale, we were enabled to sell nearly every
line, only four lots being passed in at figures which will
no doubt result in business being done. Amongst the
most important lines of greasy sold were the following:
WA/Green Wood, from Murrumbateman, at 7id ; D from
Dalton at the same figure: JH conjoined, JT A, DH all
from Yass, AA/West Blowering from Tumut, DE/R from
Rockley, MT from Goulburn, R&D/Mudgee from Qulgong,
all fetched 7d. The following realised 6Jd WW/R from
Rockley, JJ/R from same district, WB/Wattle Spring,
X/w ; 6jd being paid for Coolac II from Ooolae, JQ Oak-
field from Temora, EJ Q from Gnndagai, H/Y from Dnbbo,
MT frorn Goulburn, and WL/Mitta; 6jd for X Old Junee,
and William Hilton from Deepwater. Scoured also shared
in the brisk bidding, and we were enabled to secure 12|d
for a iine of fleece of the well-known PR brand, from
Tumut. We also obtained ll|d for a small line from
Bookhatn marked LM/TOO.
We would direct the attention of woolgrowers and others
interested to;page 3 of the Christmas issue of Tub Bullk-
tin, where a sectional view of the sample-room of our
wool store is shown, and a resumb of the wool trade sii.ee
its inception in Australia, which will be found interesting.
Our last sale this year will be held to-day (.Thursday),
21st inst.

Sydney, 15th December, 1893.
The "Antipodean.”
The second issue of the Antipodean is a lot better
than the first, and the illustrations by Frank
Mahony, Percy Spence, and B. E. Minns are
far above the average. R. L. Stevenson’s
blank verse, “To My Old Familiars,” atones for
eight cruel pages of “gossip" about himself and
his partner, Lloyd Osbourne, by J. Tighe Ryan,
which, written about any two other mortals, would
not be so wearisome. Mr. Ryan is ■ a soulless
gentleman who ignores the fact that Robert Louis
Stevenson has been sitting, with his wild hair and
his naked feet, on the chest of the Australian
public for some years past, and that this country
would celebrate with champagne and all kinds of
drink the news that Samoa was cut off from com-
munication with the outside world for 10 years to
come. A cleverly-written sketch, “An Aus-
tralian Pantomime,” is marred by an unquot-
able verse of a high-kicking dance-song.
“The Banjo’s" “ Geebung Polo Club" has its
humour intensified by Mahony’s splendidly-drawn
horsey pictures. Rolf Boldrewood’s story, “Five
Men’s Lives For a Horse ’’ has but one thing to
commend it—the author’s portrait. The tale
itself is by no means worthy of the author of
“Robbery Under Arms”—being merely the
judicial warning of a police-magistrate that the
wages of duffing a mare are death or Darlinghursb
Gaol. Charles Lilley, in a dozen leaden pages,
talks about Maoriland—and, of course, drags in
that high-flavoured Maori maiden, Hinemoa, by
the hair through the biggest part of a weary page
(The Bulletin wants to know if Hinemoa isn’t
entitled to a rest). The article also gives the
portrait of a Moderator of the Presbyterian
Assembly, and alleges it to be a “Maori Chief
in Full Dress.” Lilian Blair’s “ Dick’s Letter”
is an atonement for her “Solita” of last
year’s Antipodean, and Nat Gould’s “Racing
in Australia’’ is readable enough. All too
short is Pierce Fletcher’s “ Struggle for
Supremacy," depicting the tree life of a North
Queensland jungle. “ Types of Australian
Beauty,” shewn on the page opposite Francis
Kenna’s sombre poem of “ A Wayfarer ” and fill-
ing the two succeeding pages, must have been so
placed designedly to prepare the reader for the
depressing “ Gossip About Robert Louis Steven-
son” before-mentioned, winch follows. Edward
Bevan contributes an instructive article on “ Art
at the Antipodes.” In his “ Tale of the Western
Desert,” Ernest Favenc is at his best, and the ex-
citing story is worth reading, if only to make one
feel how good it is to be alive and able to take a drink
while other people are buried alive in the burning
Saharas which lie out on the sunset track. An
attempted humorous story about pigs is worthy
of a place in London Punch— let it pass in
silence. “Ivy,” a bigamous story by W. O.
Hodgkinson, is also humorous and much better —
by reason of its brevity. Winifred Scott’s
“Taming of Kitty Brent,” a bush tragedy told in
forceful language, has a murderer who hides the
bones of his victim “in a hole under the old bark
roof.” Generally writers of bush murders drag
in a hollow log, where the remains are discovered
by a bushman named Jim, who sees a dingo
emerging, chawing a thigh-bone, so the old bark
roof is distinctly refreshing. “Widderin,” a
bushranging episode from “Geoffrey Hamlyn,”
told in verse by John Farrell, carries one with it
to the finish :
Just a leaf from the large-hearted tale of magnifloent
years that are done
Warm with manhood and splendid with hope, and ful-
filled of the trees and the sun—
Just a shadow of terror and crime, black as ever was
written or told.
Thrown across the broad light of true friendships, and
loves that were purer than gold.
Tho intelligent comp, was more than
usually to-the-poinb when he asserted (as he did
recently in an English newspaper) that “ the ship-
owners of Hell have refused the demands of the
strikers.”
NearGulgong (N.S.W.) this notice appears
stuck on a tree near a paddock-gate :
Notiss.—Know cows is aloud in thecs hear padioks.
Any man or wuminen lettin’s his cows run I lie road wot
gits into my padicks afoarsed shall have his tale cut oft
by me and the dorgs sided on her.
The great carnival and sale now being
held by Messrs, J. F. Collins and Co., at their
extensive premises, 235, 237, and 23'.) Bitt-street,
Sydney, is the sight of this festive season. To
attempt to enumerate even a few of the extra-
ordinary bargains in ladies’ and men’s and chil-
dren’s clothing would be a hopeless task for any
sane human being. Still more hopeless would it
be to endeavour to describe the endless variety of
style, pattern, and finish of the wealth of goods so
profusely displayed in this great emporium. One
line of the Messrs. Collins’ business is, however,
especially worthy of mention, inasmuch as it is
the specialty which, more than any other, has
made them famous—suits to order from 555., and
trousers from 12s, (sd.
In these days of scepticism and medical
fraud the advent <>f new remedies for alleviating
or curing tho bodily ills of humanity is received
by most people with perfectly justifiable doubt,
and only those remedies that stand the crucial
test of their alleged virtues by suffering people
survive the ordeal. Tike, for instance, rheumat-
ism. How many thousands of wildly-craeked-np
specifics have been palmed off upon those who
writhe and groan in its excruciating tortures—
and how few have proved their efficacy. The
remedy known as “Thulinius,” however, seems
to stand higher than the average. Some of the
cures reported are sufficiently remarkable, and the
testimonials from Sydney people forwarded to the
proprietor are worth reading.
Within the last two months something
like 23 books have been published in London about
Matabeleland or Mashonaland, written by all
sorts and conditions of men and women on all
sorts of subjects, from Lobengula’s policy to the
pattern of Cecil Rhodes’ socks. Unless an earth-
quake or the cholera or some such Providential
interposition arises and wipes the place out of
existence, the name of Matabeleland will prove as
great a burden upon humanity as that of Robert L.
Stevenson.
Said Julian Salomons, in arguing a case in
Sydney Banco last term :—“ A fire-proof safe, y’r
Honors, see, is a safe of the kind sold as fire-
proof.” “But a fire-proof safe must be a safe
that is proof against fire,” interrupted one of their
Honors. “Oh no, no, your Honor,” replied the
Q. 0., “there is no kind of safe that is proof
against fire—as men will find out when the end
of the world comes.”
The cataleptic town of Cardwell (N.Q.)
was actually on the drunk once in its history, A
surveyor’s party had come down from - the
Tally River in a cutter; and owing to this unex-
pected break in the monotony the whole town was
violently inebriated. The surveyor’s men had to
start back —some 30 miles—on the midnight tide.
They got aboard per dingy, roaring drunk; and
clapped on every rag the cutter had, though it
was blowing fresh. One man took the tiller; the
rest went to sleep, until they were suddenly
awakened by hearing the helmsman yelling out a
song. He had been at the rum-keg. By this time
it was blowing hard. “Where are we, Jack?”
“ Oh, close up. Ain’t she just travelling 1 ” Then
they went to sleep again. When they next woke,
the first object that arrested their vision was the
Cardwell publican, standing on his verandah and
rubbing his eyes, because the cutter was high and
dry on the mud in exactly the same spot where it
had been at high tide. They had been sailing all
night, but had forgotten to take up the kellick.
Dear Bulletin, —My word, it just was hot,
and the ex-Samoan and I didn’t know what to do
to cool ourselves. “Ah ! I’ve an idea,” said he;
“I’ll show you how we do it where I last came
from. Let’s go and buy two watermelons.”
“Two?” “Yes, two; and the two largest we
can get.” We went, we bought, and we struggled
onward, sweating and praying. “Come to my
cellar.” We kummed. “Strip.” “Stark?”
“ Matter of taste; I’ll keep my flannel on
myself.” I did the same. Then the Samoan
genius produced a huge piratical cutlass, with
which he halved each water-melon. “litre's a
dish for you,”said he; “here’s one for me. Now,
scoop out the meat, and do as I do.” He scooped
out all the fruit of both his halves, and then—
sat down in one half of the shell, and put the
other half on his head.” I did the same. We
ate all the “meat ” between smokes. Then “the
sun went down and all the land was dark.”— The
Dipsomaniac.

The Ophir of Charles du Breil.
Fourteen years ago Charles dußreil, Marquis
de Ray, whose death was reported last week, was in
the zenith of success and popularity as the organ-
iser of a colonising movement that was to create a
New France in Oceania, and Frenchmen went as
mad over him as they did 10 years later over
Boulanger. And as the military charlatan’s
schemes grew, inflated, and burst disastrously,
so did those of the enthusiastic Charles. Yet,
paradoxical as it sounds, he was an honest
swindler. He believed in his impossible scheme,
and when it fell flat with the dull and sickening
thud of a gone-bung Australian financial institu-
tion, no one lost more money over it than he did.
John Law, with his Mississippi venture, and
Blount, with his youth Sea Bubble, were mere
ordinary swindlers. Du Breil honestly believed
in his great fraud, and, like prancing Boulanger,
saw a dictatorship looming ahead for him —in the
palm-groves of Oceania.

The prospectus of Nouvelle France came
out in 1879. Land had been bought (honestly
enough) in New Ireland, and elaborate plans were
prepared of the new city with its extensive wharf
frontages, and public buildings, and parks and
promenades, together with supplementary plans
of the suburbs, where every settler was to live in
a gorgeous bungalow, with green blinds and tes-
sellated floors, while native servants in abundance
hung around to clean his boots and mix iced
drinks. The plan of the city was dotted over
with big cathedrals. This pleased the priests and
the pious old maids, who subscribed largely for
shares. And gold and other valuable commodities
were indicated in the prospectus.
* * •
The climate was described as “delight-
fully cool and somewhat moist, and specially suit-
able for the cultivation of grapes and figs.” The
natives were “amiable and hospitable,’’and further-
more were yearning to be made into good
Catholics. Seventeen priests immediately volun-
teered to go and show them how to do it, and the
clergy took up more shares. In a few months 2000
persons had enrolled themselves as colonists of
Nouvelle France and were ready to start. From
Barcelona and other Spanish ports came hundreds
of the better class of peasantry, all intent on
settling on each family’s purchase of 20 hectares
(at so many hundred francs per hectare), and
Italian emigrants tumbled over one another in
their eagerness to buy shares and get away in the
first ship, to a country where they could have
four square meals a day, and where “ wine-
making would be a staple industry.” (Gin, at a
dollar a bottle, is the only liquor known to the
native and white nobility in New Ireland). And
then the clergy kept booming up Charles’s fad to
the best of their ability, took more shares,
appointed a bishop in part thus, and looked
eagerly forward to sharing in the profits.

The French contingent (recruited prin-
cipally from Marseilles and Toulon) consisted of
about as shady a lot of people as ever kept out of
a gaol. The first lot sailed in the barque
Chandernagore, and on their way to their
El Dorado put in at Sydney. The captain of the
ship was M'Laehlan, the commander of the
colonists M. de Villacroix, both men of deter-
mination and nerve, and able to cope with the
ruffianly element on board which sought to raise a
mutiny and make things rough generally. After
a few weeks’ stay in Sydney, during which time
the daily press grew black in the face endeavour-
ing to prove the expedition a French piratical
excursion, bent on annexing Australia and taking
away Parkes, or bombarding Pinchgut or some-
thing, the Ohandernagore, with the flag of Liberia
at her gaff, and 80 colonists filled with claret and
enthusiasm on deck, sailed away to El Dorado.
* * *
M‘Lachlan, the captain of the Chander-
nagore, soon found he had a large contract on
hand. But he and Villacroix were grim cus-
tomers, and when the ruffianly element on
board tried to run the expedition and the Chan-
dernagore on their own ideas they got badly left.
Thirty-nine days after leaving Sydney 12 of the
colonists elected to land at the Lachlan Islands
(lat, 9° S., 153° W. Ion.) instead of going on to
New Ireland. The island looked very nice, the
coloured ladies were very agreeable in their
manners, and they had plenty of claret—why go
farther. This was their El Dorado, so they
stopped. Some of them died there of fever, and
some gob eaten.
* * *
A few weeks more and they reached the
site of Du Breil’s great city at Port Breton, on
the south end of New Ireland—with the exception
of the dismal Falklands, probably the most dank,
sodden, squashy and muddy region on earth. The
place looked very nice, however, in a transient
gleam of yellow sunshine, and the precipitous
sides of the mountains were clothed with tropical
verdure. Some claret was drunk and many cheers
given. Then it commenced to rain furiously for
40 days and 40 nights. Sometimes the deluge would
stop for a quarter of an hour, and then the
colonists of New France would bolt on shore to
select their farms, but before any pegs were
driven in another few thousand tons of water
would fall and send them back to the ship to
drink more claret. So they got tired of it at last
and asked the captain to look out for another El
Dorado where it wasn’t quite so wet. He took them
to Likiliki Bay, near Cape St. George. Here
they commenced to clear “ the wondrously fertile
land ” (about 3900 trees to the acre—leaving out
vines, &c.), and drink more claret. (The history
of the expedition was a wild orgie of claret from
beginning to end.) At this place the rain wasn’t
so bad—only about 6in. per diem—and, as the
Marquis had said the climate was humid, they
didn’t grumble any more.
# • #
The steamer Genii followed with more
people, principally women, and then a large
barque—the Marquis de Ray—came in loaded
with claret and cotton-ginning machinery, and
other material for founding a colony and convert-
ing the heathen. She was made into a storeship
and became the scene of much hilarity and beauty,
the latter imported from the streets of Marseilles
and Toulon. Meantime, every day one or several
died of fever. A few months of this, and the
expedition burst up, and, as everyone had both
legs swelled to a stupendous size through taking
too much quinine, everything came to a standstill.
Then Tom Farrell, an English trader at Mioko,
on the Duke of York Island, appeared in time to
save the colony from making itself into a huge
cemetery, and arranged to give the survivors
passages to Sydney. The whole lot fell on his
neck, and kissed him, and wept profusely down
his back
Justhere another steamer arrived, with 600
more colonists—principally Spaniards from Barce-
lona —all anxious to get into their bungalows and
other varieties of country palaces. She was the
Nouvelle Bretagne, and hardly had she dropped
anchor before a Spanish cruiser—the La Gaspe—
came, and straightway arrested the captain of the
Nouvelle Bretagne for some mysterious outrage
committed on the voyage out, and took him away
to Manilla. And suddenly it occurred to the
passengers that they would go back to Spain and
abjure their sodden, ghost-haunted El Dorado; so
without further delay the Nouvelle Bretagne
followed in the wake of the La Gaspe; leaving
the Frenchmen and Italians to take free board
and lodging with Tom Farrell, at Mioko.
* * *
Placing Capt. Fred. Boore in charge of
the Genii (Rabardy, the French skipper, had
died), Farrell sent his troublesome boarders away
to Sydney. The ancient steamer arrived safely in
Port Jackson and the Government of New South
Wales made provision for the emigrants; many
of whom are now doing well in the Clarence and
Richmond River districts as farmers. The
Marquis was tried for obtaining money under
false pretences, sentenced to four years’ imprison-
ment, and fined 30,000 francs. Certainly he was
an adventurer—because the enterprise burst up.
Had it succeeded, he would have been called
a philanthropist. And but for the claret and the
dancing and the hilariousness of everybody con-
cerned it should have succeeded.

The recent Salvation Army prosecutions
in Maoriland furnished a glorious “ad. ” for the
big-drum brigade. Two officers, a colonel and a
majah, having maddened the people of Milton by
blowing their vociferous wind instrument all over
the town for many days and nights, were at last
fined in a small amount, and as they declined to
pay and told the Law that it was a lost soul, or
words to that effect, they finished upin gaol. When
they came out a huge demonstration was worked
up at the Army’s “fortress” in Dunedin. Two
prison cells were erected on the platform, each
with an iron-grated window, a shelf with a bible,
a bench and other fittings. In the middle of the
service an alleged warder appeared dragging in
the colonel and the majah, in prison dress, and
locked one in each cell. When they endeavoured
to speak to him through the grating he sternly
ordered them to “shut up.” After a while he
brought the majah out by the collar, and allowed
him to address the audience, but in the midst of
his pathetic account of his sufferings the warder
re-arrested him and ran him in with violence. Then
he brought out the colonel with needless ferocity,
but presently, just as his oration was making good
progress the persecutor fell upon him also and ran
him in again, and ordered him to keep silence.
Next he brought out the majah a second time, but
in the middle of a hymn that sufferer was re-cap-
tured, and the colonel had another show. After
they had both been let out five or six times the
warder finally locked up the pair of them, and
presently he brought each of them a pannikin of
tea and a hunk of forbidding-looking bread, which
they ate with great difficulty in their cells. Fin-
ally a collection was taken up in one of the panni-
kins, and the proceedings closed, the colonel and
the majah, when last seen, being asleep, each on
the cold floor of his dungeon, while the warder
maintained a relentless attitude outside the door.
Vows.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN ].
Not to be bound by chains,
However golden;
Not to be vowed, or thralled,
In no way holden.
Not to be kept forever bound
To a word, that, meant when spoken,
May lose its meaning with the years,
Yet must live on unbroken.
Not to receive a vow
No man may pay thee,
Vowing to love till death,
Through death it may be.
Not to shut eyes and turn away
From the powers that loves dissever,
Close eyes to Time, be blind, and say,
This love shall last for ever.
Only the now we know,
Or dream we know it;
Others may reap the grain,
Though our hands sow it.
Future and past alike are not,
We may joy to-day, or sorrow,
May love as we two love, beloved,
And love no more to-morrow.
Let us go into love
With eyes unblinded,
Seeing life’s long beyond,
And death behind it;
Feel we our fierce immortal faith
But in silence sweet, not say it
In words, for what are we, beloved?
A day, an hour, may slay it.
Yet, oh my one beloved,
What vow could bind us
Closer than this one kiss?
The world behind us.
Starlight and moonlight in the east,
In the west a dull, red river,
And somewhere, God, to read our hearts,
And write on us “For Ever.”
Sydney.

A recent visitor to La Grande Chartreuse
says that the youngest monk in residence is inor
than 50 years of age. In less than a-quarter of a
century the last holy father may be expected to
die out along with his Order, and the monastic
cordial manufactory will be a romance of the past.
They have been, generally speaking, a queer lot,
these concoctors of the famous green and golden
liquors. The stories told of their continence, the
alleged result of virtuous properties in chartreuse,
were simply moonshine. Guides point out a cer-
tain window of a holy cell from which a rope used
to be lowered in the gloaming, the said rope being
subsequently hauled up with a damsel attached.
At last the rope, worn out by exposure to weather
and the weight of the fair sex, broke. A girl’*
neck was also broken by the fall, but the guilty
father —who doubtless pulled pro bono monkico —
was smuggled away. Nobody got into trouble,
with the exception of the lady deceased. This
scandal spread abroad, however, and the old
fiction that a steady consumption of chartreuse
kept the tender passion under complete control
was thereupon abandoned. The Pope who decided
to wind up the Order evidently knew all about it.

Even now it would appear that the story of the
moral Matthias Larkin (he used to go to early chapel every
morning) is not quite finished, and the utter bottomless-
m si of that saint hasn’t been fully appreciated even yet.
The latest allegation is that still another £40,000 dis-
crepancy has turned up in the accounts of his Building
Society. The principal item in this terrific shortage is
said to have disappeared in 1886 seven long
years ago. Yet the accounts of the society were
overhauled every year and duly certified as correct.
Then there was a stupendous special overhaul at the time
when Matthias fell from grace, and all manner of things
which the auditors had never noticed came to light.
Later on, when Matthias was safely in gaol, there was
some more overhaul, and a lot more robberies—on which
it was proposed to base a second prosecution—turned up.
And now, when it might reasonably be supposed that
every separate item in the accounts and every security
had been inspected unto seventy times seven, it ia
seriously alleged that a deficiency of £40,000 has alto-
gether escaped notice, and that the holy Matthias has
been at it again quite unobserved.
If this latest story is true, then it would seem
as if it were quite possible for any big financial institution
in Australia to have been robbed of all its capital and
reserve fund somewhere about the year 1860, and the
matter to have been accidentally overlooked until now.
And it would also seem that there is no faith in auditing
or in auditors, and that financial experts are a simple-
minded race and easily taken in. Also, the incident is
still another warning against the pious banker. When
anybody in a position of trust shows premonitory symp-
toms of piety, then it is time to sack him at an instant's
notice. Even a suspicion of hidden piety ought to be
sufficient re. son for a special investigation. Further,
shareholders should keep an eye of distrust on fat and
benevolent-looking officials of all kinds. The manager
who embezzles the cash, and the auditor who fails to
discover him doing it, are almost invariably Jovial
men with corporations. Auditors especially should be
gaunt, hungry-looking, morose men of a discontented and
quarrelsome turn of mind.

Greece, the historical land to which the
fatuous J. Bull has lent something like £20,000,000,
is now offering 10s. in the £ with no security for the pay-
ment of the composition. Australasia is pretty nearly the
only country which borrowed largely from Bull or any-
body else, and didn’t let the lender in at some time or
Other. Even some of the big states of Europe have com-
pounded with their creditors in the past, Austria, for
example, paying a humble Is 2d. in the £, said Is. 2d.
oeing in paper, while Russia panned out 6s. in the £, also
in paper. A good many of these states are now about
ready for another burst, and Bull, as the most enterpris-
ing lender, will be “ left ” again. And evefi this will be
only preparatory to the great day of uni\ ersal burst, when
Bull will be left altogether, and for the very last time.

“Samuel Heckscher, senr., Banker, Hamburg,"
continues to bombard Australia with his “ State lottery "
circulars. Wherefore it is obvious that the paternal
postal authorities, who refuse to deliver letters to George
Adams or J. J. Miller, are not refusing to despatch letters
(in printed envelopes) to the precious Hamburg “banker.”
An extract from lleckscher’s latest circular should serve
as a solemn warning to the unwary—“ The present offer
concerns the 305th lottery, in which from the 3rd to the
7th class of 103,000 numbers successively 48,400 must
win for certain. The winning chance is therefore a very
large one, as about one half of all the numbers will be
drawn with prizes.” The privilege of one whole ticket
can be obtained for 365. As far as one can understand,
then, the “sweep” amounts to £185,000, whilst the grand
total of the prize-money is £406,850. But there are so
many classes, and such a fearful complication of figures
upon the circular that the above estimate may be far
below the truth, Samuel Heckscher is probably the only
man on earth who understands all the gorgeous possi-
bilities of a 365. ticket.

Editor Bulletin, —One of the most frequent

namely, to get the shearing over quickly. Since the
average shareholder in a pastoral company ordinarily
fails to sympathise with the grievances of any working

An official assignee of a back-blocks estate,
having unavailingly sued a debtor to the estate, lately
applied to make the debtor bankrupt. The debtor was,
in due course, adjudged bankrupt, and thereupon that
assignee was appointed official assignee in his estate
as well. This opens up great possibilities to an
energetic assignee. If, for instance, the official assignee
of a large banking or other corporation procured the
sequestration of ail debtors’ estates and became official
assignee in respect to them, he might secure profitable
occupation for the balance of his life.
Now that whaling from the port of Sydney
Is to be revived, the following (taken from the report of
the select committee on the Costa Rica Packet case) will
be of interest : On the first voyage of the Packet in 1887
(Malayan Archipelago), when she only carried three boats
and an inefficient crew, she took 76 whales during the
season (Ist Nov. to 10th Jan.); value of sperm oil, between
£14,000 and £15,000. For the voyage of 1891 she carried
six boats and a picked crew and had taken but two whales
at the commencement of the season, when the captain was
arrested hy the Dutchmen at Ternate. With the most
ordinary luck, she would have returned to Sydney with
oil to the value of over £20,000.
The select committee seems to have had amber-
gris on the brain, and the witnesses in the case told them
all that could be told on the matter. The captain, how-
ever, mentioned that he never counted on obtaining
ambergris, although a careful search was always made.
Grey ambergris is worth sometimes 1 10 an ounce. Capt.
Carpenter himself once got 501 b. He heard of one case
where 20001 b. was taken out of one whale (at £lO per 07.
this would be worth £320,0001),
Particulars of the right-whaling cruise of the
Costa Rica in 1839 elicited the information that the price
of baleen (whale-bone) varies from £2BOO to £3200 per
ton. The smallest quantity that Capt. Carpenter ever
took from a whale was 7001 b., the largest 32001 b. The oil
of the right-whale, however, is worth but half that of the
sperm whale, which is now quoted at £5O to £54 a ton.
At the Otis ore crushing works, at South Mel-
bourne (Vic.), the mills and concentrators have been
working full time during the past two months. There
has been a rush of orushings from Westralian claims,
among these being several tons of rich quartz from the
Golden Gate and Aushu Island claims, Murchison, which
averaged 4oz. 19dwt. per ton. The searching character
of the crushing as proved hy the infinitesimal difference
between the metal won and the assay value of the stone
has been such a recommendation of the Otis crusher that
the owners of the Golden Gate have ordered a complete
treating plant, consisting of a No. 3 crusher fitted with
copper-plates and a pair of Otis amalgamators. These
are now being gotten ready for shipment to the new field
where they will treat 250 tons a week. A similar plant
is in course of shipment to the Frances Reward Co., Mur-
chison, having been worked continuously at South Mel-
bourne for some time on Murchison stone to the satisfac-
tion of the purchasers. The Mount Magnet (VV.A.), which
recently purchased an Otis crushing and amalgamating
plant, has just completed its first crushing, and wires
that the return was 4300 z. from 120 tons.
Pnrnamoota, Barrier district (N.S.W.) once had
a flutter as a gold country, but although the Black Prince
was a fairly good thing, difficulties in the way of treat-
ment stopped general investment. Now a big area has
been taken up by Uriah Dudley, and a lot of the big Hill
men, and is to be worked for all it is worth. Mr. Dudley
conducted tests of 10 tons of stone from this properly—
known as the King—the machine used being the Otis
crusher and amalgamator. The finest screens were used
and excellent results obtained, almost all of the assay-
value being saved. Mr. W. B. Wilson has forwarded to
the Otis Co. a big quantity of very rich gold stone mined
from the Day Dawn Co., Cue (W.A.). Westralia coming
as the last of the reefers gains the experience of the
older provinces which have burned their fingers over in-
efficient machinery. The Otis crusher and the Otis
amalgamators came into favour at the right time-
cautious managers in Maoriland and Westralia purchased
baby plants to start with. The baby plants have done
more than their work, with the result that numerous are
the “ repeat ” orders received by the Co. from the people
who Justify their first Judgment by their most recent
action. Gippsland, by the way, has got hold of something
big. The Otis Co. crushed 6 tons of Gippsland ore,
assaying over lOoz. gold and 350 z. silver per ton.

BOSISTO’S
‘Parrot Brand’ Eucalyptus Oil
FOR
Rheumatism, Sprains, Coughs, Colds,
Sore Throats, Influenza, etc.
Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.
SW CAUTION.—Be Careful to Secure

The Subversion of
Discipline.
( FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I considered my appointment to the Public
School at Smiley’s Lagoon the first step in a
career that would at least end in an inspectorship,
for I was a born teacher. I would have taken a
class in Inferno with the certain conviction of
becoming head-master.
Teach? I could teach anything. I had trained
a dog and other pet animals to a perfection almost
supernatural. I had studied every “Art of
Teaching” and “School of Management” from
cover to cover.
I had formed theories of ray own. I had planned
a system which, if carried out, would make a
school a model of discipline.
The whereabouts of Smiley’s Lagoon was a
matter of indifference—at most, I would be there
only 12 months. After the first examination, I
would be allowed to sit for exam.—l would be
promoted—next year, my skill-mark would be
good enough for another grade—l would pass—
obtain a first-class school, and become, by sheer
force of merit, an inspector. It was so simple, I
laughed at the thought of being daunted by
Smiley’s Lagoon.
The weekly Royal Mail dropped me, my dog,
and my carpet-bag, on a hot, dusty road, from
which branched a bridle-track. Taking advantage
of the halt, the driver tied up a broken trace with
hair pulled from his poor horse’s tail, and said :
“The last teacher boarded with Regan’s, he
did—down the track, a matter of five mile away,
maybe. I s’pose they’ll take you in, too. S’long.’’
I reached a bark humpy, and, assuming it to be
Regan’s, “ Good evening,” I said.
‘ ‘ Day ! ”
“ I’m the new teacher—my name’s Reed.”
“ Hum ! ”
“I understand that my predecessor boarded
here, and I’ll be obliged if you will accommodate
me for a few days, till I have a look round.”
“ If you stops here, you boards here for always—
seventeen bob a week and no second table, under-
stand. Sling your swag in there. Tommy sleeps
there, but he won’t mind you.”
The accommodation was simply swinish. I
sickened in anticipation. But, after all, it was
only a probation. I would work—work—work. I
would wrap myself up in my ambition. I would
cloak myself in the armour of indomitable will,
and, in the certainty of success, become con-
temptuous of trivialities.
As I walked to school, I overtook three girls—
apparently about 18.
“Surely,” I thought, “they don’t go to
school ? ”
But, yes; each carried the inevitable lunch-bag.
My theory as regards discipline prevented any-
thing more than a “ Good morning ” as I passed.
But, Heavens! what a face!—an orchid among
cabbages ! The sweetest and prettiest and most
innocent-looking face I had ever seen, even in
pictures. After all, my lot was not so bad.
“ Ain’t he a goat!”
Surely they didn’t mean me ?
“ Hush, Ju, he’ll hear you.”
“ I don’t care. Look at his legs—not bandy, I
know.”
Shade of Socrates ! They were speaking of me.
Me —for my legs are a trifle—only a trifle—bowed.
I determined to wait until I had ascertained how
the school had been conducted by my predecessor,
before attempting any innovation.
Discipline ? They tumbled over one another —
they stamped—laughed—talked; and foremost in
everything was Julia O'Neill —the innocent-faced
girl I had passed on the road.
A radical change was necessary before any good
results could follow. I had occasion to reprimand
her some days later. She pouted and sulked, and
at the end of the lesson—letter-writing—her slate
was blank.
I ordered her to stay in and write it. Three
minutes after she handed it up :
Dear Nora, —I am kept in to write a letter. I don’t like
the new teacher a bit. He ain’t half as nice as Mr.
Kennedy. I don’t think he can say “ 800 1” No more,
from your loving Julia.
I was thunderstricken. I her to write out
“ Impertinence !” five thousand times.
She folded her- arms demurely, and sat looking
at me with a twinkle in her eyes.
I kept her in each day for a week. She only
laughed. I made her stand on a chair; and, on
referring to the shame, she said, “ Ain’t I
ashamed ? No. Look ! I only take threes.”
I put a dunce’s cap on her. She wore it with a
rakish air; and, winking at the class, asked per-
mission to make it more becoming 1 I wrote some
scathing remarks in her exercise book, and found
the leaf pinned on the gate I had to pass through.
Where were my theories about discipline ? How
could I expect obedience when I could not enforce
it? The whole school was demoralised. Had I
had the power, I would have rescinded the regula-
tions relating to corporal and, betray-
ing my manhood, flogged her.
One day, I glanced at her slate. She had
drawn a man standing on his head, his legs form-
ing a circle through which a dog was jumping.
The caricature struck home, and I struck her
across the knuckles with the cane in my hand. A
red weal rose, but she did not wince. She just
said, quietly, “I’ll report you for that 1”
I was beaten. There was nothing but expulsion
—an admission of defeat.
I told her she would not be admitted next day;
and, after school, sat down, humiliated and sad-
dened, to report the matter to the Inspector.
I was startled by a knock and she walked in.
“Well?”
“ Please, don’t expel me.”
I looked at her in astonishment. After all, she
was not icholly bad.
“I can’t help it, Julia, You have ruined the
whole school. It is my last resource.”
I felt glad that she had been touched by the
disgrace, and made some remarks about it.
/‘Disgrace be bothered ! I don’t care—only I
like coming to school.”
“ I don’t understand you a bit, Julia,” I said ;
“ You like it; you like it; still, you make all
this trouble! Were you the same with Mr.
.Kennedy?” "" :
“ML Kennedy! Poof! I’d rather be caned
by you than —than, oh ! expd me, if you like. I
don’t care.”
I hesitated. A victory would do so much
towards regaining my lost authority. Could I
trust her ? It was worth while trying, anyway.
“ Well, Julia,” I said ; “ I’ll give you another
chance. You have caused me a lot of anxiety.”
I laid my hand on her shoulder.
“Let us try if we cannot like one another a
little better.”
She dashed my hand away, and her eyes flashed.
*‘Li I< you? Why, I hate you! Don’t touch
me. 1 hate you with every breath in my body.
Don’t touch me, or I’ll kill you 1”
She laughed hysterically; and, thinking she
was about to fall, I put out my arm. She sprang
aside, and, seizing a bottle of red ink from the
table, threw it at me with all her force. It struck
me on the chest; and the red ink streamed down
my shirt-front and splashed my face.
“ What does this mean ?”
We had been too excited to notice the approach
of Mrs. Regan, chief scandal-monger, until she
stood at the door, and saw—Julia, with dis-
hevelled hair, flushed face, and heaving bosom ; I,
apparently covered with blood, holding her wrist !
“ What does this mean ? ”
“ Oh, he wanted to -to — Oh, take me home,
take me home ! ”
A week later, I received an intimation suspend-
ing me from duty, pending an investigation. Two
weeks later, the inspector tui’ned up. I stated the
case, and he asked for a private interview with
Julia.
After it was over, he said to me—“ You have
had a narrow escape. I congratulate you. The
girl corroborates your story; but it is fortunate
for you.”
“ But why did she throw the bottle at me? ”
“ Because she loves you.”
PONTE.
MY WATCH AND OTHER WATCHES.
One evening last summer I had some writing to
do at my house. The weather was very hot, and
I took off my coat and waistcoat. My new gold
watch (that I had paid .£3O for) I laid before me
on the table, where I could keep an eye on it. So
far so good. I wrote on, and papers accumulated on
the table, one of them covering my watch. Reach-
ing out for something I wanted, my arm
accidentally swept it to the floor. Oh, heavens,
what luck ! I picked it up —tenderly as one picks
up a child who has had a bad tumble. Was it
still running ? Yes, faintly ; but as I put it to my
ear it ticked a few times, feebly and slowly, and
then stopped—a dead watch. A minute ago it
was a vital thing—now merely a lot of motionless
wheels in a case. What was broken ? I couldn’t
say. The watchmaker must repair it and return
it, with his bill. So much for my stupid care-
lessness.
Yet nobody is so poor as not to carry a more
valuable watch than that; one that will run many
years without winding. But when it stops, ah !
then, who is able to set it going again ?
Speaking about the one he owns, Mr. Geo. W.
Burton, of Kirton Holme, Boston, says : “My
heart fluttered in a way to alarm me. Sometimes
it was so bad I fancied I could hear it stop heat-
ing.”
What ailed Mr. Burton’s heart ? Perhaps his
letter will help us to find out. He says : —“ln
October, 1887, I began to feel very weary and
languid. I had a bad taste in the mouth, and in
the morning my teeth and gums were covered with
a thick bloody slime. My appetite failed, and
after eating I had great pain in the chest and
stomach. All the time I had a craving for food,
but dare not take solids. It seemed sometimes
that my head would burst with pain, and I was
so dizzy I could hardly see. After a while a cough
set in, and I spat up great quantities of phlegm.
Later on my breathing became very bad, and I
would break out into a cold sweat. I kept on
growing weaker until it was all I could do to get
about, and in this condition I continued for four
years. During this time I consulted doctors and
used all the different medicines I heard of, but
none of them did any good.”
Now, let’s think a minute. Mr. Burton says
his heart fluttered and palpitated, he had a hack-
ing cough, and difficulty in breathing—three
frightful things. A man might die of any one of
them, as we all know. Yet he recovered from all
of them— and all at the same time. He says
“In February, 1891, I heard of what Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup had done in similar cases,
and I determined tojry it, and got a bottle from
Messrs. Grimble and Kent, chemists, Boston.
The first few doses gave relief, and by continuing
to use it in a short time I was perfectly cured. I
make this statement in order that others may
know where to look for a remedy in an illness like
mine” (Signed) “ Geo. W. Burton.”
We rejoice at his restoration to health, but
what, after all, ailed him ? Did he have three
diseases—viz., hearl complaint, consumption, and
asthma? And, if so, how on earth could Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup have cured them—each
affecting different organs ? The answer is, he had
but one disease, indigestion and dyspepsia, of
which the feeble heart, the irritated throat, and
the burdened lungs were tell-tales and symptoms.
The poisoned blood —filled with deadly acids from
the stomach —half paralysed the nerves and thus
disordered the heart’s action ; it also infected the
delicate membrane lining of the lungs and air
passages, producing asthma and the cough that
seemed to threaten consumption. One disease,
many misleading symptoms—that is the truth ;
deluding physicians, and frightening patients into
thinking there is no hope.
When life’s timepiece runs down no power on
earth can wind it up again, but Mr. Burton’s case,
and thousands more, prove that it is often good
for many a year after you thought the works
would soon be motionless in the case.

The Fallacies of Hilliard.
( FOR THE BULLETIN.)
With clenched hand grasping the two
letters —the one that sank his last hope of saving
his plantation and the other that blasted his trust
in human nature—Hilliard, the planter of Nairai
Viwa, walked with quick, firm step to his house,
and sat down to think awhile. The great cotton
“burst-up” had ruined most men in Fiji, and
although long delayed in his case the blow had
crushed him utterly.
An angry flush tinged his set features for a few
seconds as he re-read the curt, almost savage
denial, by his father of the “couple of thousand ”
asked for. “A fool to resign his commission in
the Service and go into a thing he knew nothing
about, merely to humour the fantastic whim of a
woman of fashion who will, no doubt, now sheer
very clear of your wrecked fortunes.”
Ten minutes previously when Hilliard, who had
thought his father would never see him go under
for the sake of a couple of thou., had read these
lines he had smiled, even with the despair of
broken fortune at his heart, as he looked at the
other letter yet unopened.
Kitty, at least, would stick to him. He was not
a maudlin sentimentalist, but the memory of her
farewell kisses was yet strong with him ; and his
past experiences of woman’s weaknesses and his
own strength justified him in thinking that in this
one woman he had found his pearl of great price.
Then he read the letter; and as he read the
tappa mallets at work in the Fijian houses hard
by seemed to thump in unison with the dull beats
of his heart as he stared at the correctly-
worded and conventionally-expressed lines that
mocked at his fond imaginings of but a few
breaths back.
• # *
Jimmy, the curly-headed half-caste who
had brought him his letters from Levuka, had
followed in his steps and was sitting, hat in hand,
on the sofa before him when Hilliard raised his
face. The fixed pallor had left his bronzed cheeks.
For an instant the face of another man had passed
before him —Lamington, his one-time fellow-
officer, whom everyone but Hilliard himselt
looked upon as being first “ in the running ” with
the woman who had pledged herself to him. But,
then, Lamington himself had told him that she
had refused him, heir to a big fortune as he was,
and they had shaken hands, and Lamington had
wished him luck in his honest, good-natured
fashion. “Perhaps," and here the dark flush
mantled his forehead, “ he’s tried again and she’s
slung me. Audi . . . * What a damnably
unpleasant and quick intuition of women’s ways
my old dad has ! I always wondered why such a
fiery devil as he was married such a milk-and-
water creature as my good mother. By , I
begin to think he went on safe lines, and I on a
fallacy 1”
• # •
The stolid face of Jimmy recalled him to
the present. He must give up the plantation and
take a berth of some sort. From the sideboard he
took a flask of liquor and poured out two big
drinks.
“ Here, Jimmy, my boy. This is the last drink
you’ll get on Nairai Yiwa. I’m burst up, cleaned
out, dead broke, and going to Hell generally.”
Jimmy grunted and held out his brown hand
for the grog. “Yes? I s’pose you’ll go to
Levuka first? I’ll give you a passage in the
cutter.”
Hilliard laughed with mingled bitterness and
sarcasm. “Right, Jimmy. Levuka is much like
the other place, and I’ll get experience there, if I
don’t get a billet.”
“ Here’s luck to you, sir, wherever you go,’’and
Jimmy’s thick lips glued themselves lovingly to
the glass.
Hilliard drank his off quietly, only muttering to
himself, “Here’s goodbye to the fallacies of
hope,” and then, being at bottom a man of sense
and quick resolution, he packed his traps and at
sunset went aboard the cutter. As they rippled
along with the first puffs of the land-breeze, he
glanced back but once at the lights of Nairai
Yiwa village that illumined the cutter’s wake,
and then, like a wise man, the hopes and dreams
of the past drifted astern too.
# # *
The laughing, merry-voiced native children
who, with speedy feet, ran to the house of IliSti,
the trader, to tell him that a visitor wa« ~ >ming
from the man-of-war, had gathered with ting
breath and hushed expectancy, at the door as the
figure of the naval officer turned a bend in the
path, his right hand clasped with a proud air of
proprietorship by that of the ten-year-old son of
Alberti the Chief.
Iliati, with a half-angry, half-pleased look, held
out his hand.
“ Lamington !”
“Hilliard ! old fellow. Why didn’t you come
on board ? Are all your old friends forgotten ?”
* « •
“ Pretty nearly, Lamington. Since I
came a cropper over that accursed cotton swindle
I’ve not had any inclination to meet anyone I
knew —especially anyone in the Service, but ”
and his voice rang honestly, “ I always wondered
whether you and I would ever meet again.”
“Hilliard,” and Lamington placed his hand on
the trader’s shoulder, “ I know all about it. And
look here, old man. I saw her only two months
ago—at her especial request. She sent for me to
talk about you.”
“ Ah ?” and the trader’s voice sounded coldly,
“ I thought, long ago, that she had reconsidered
her foolish decision of other days and had long
since become Mrs. Lamington. But it doesn’t
interest me, old fellow. Can you drink Fiji rum,
Lamington? Haven’t anything better to offer
you.”
“I’ll drink anything you’ve got, old fellow,
even liquid Tophet boiled down to a small half-
pint ; but I want you to listen to me first. I’ve
been a bit of a scoundrel to you, but, by God, old
man, I exchanged into the beastly old Petrel for
this cruise expresslj to find you and make a clean
breast of it. I promised her I would.”
“Confound it all, Lamington, don’t harrow
your feelings needlessly, and let us have the rum
and talk about anything else.”
“No. We won’t. Look here, Hilliard, it
sounds beastly low, but I must get it out. W
met again—at a ball in Sydney more than
two years ago. Some infernal chattering women
were talking a lot of rot about the planters in
Fiji having very pretty and privileged native
servants—and all that, you know. She fired up
and denied it, but came and asked me if it was
true, and I was mean enough not to give it a
straight denial. How the devil it happened I
can’t tell you, but we danced a deuce of a lot and
I lost my senses and asked her again, and she
said ‘Yes.’ Had she been any other woman but
Miss , I would have concluded that the soft
music and all that had dazed her. It does some-
times —lots of ’em ; makes the most virtuous wife
wish she could be a sinner and resume her normal
goodness next day. But Kitty is different.
And it was only that infernal twaddle caused
it and made her write you that letter. A
week hadn’t passed before she wrote to me and
told me how miserable she was. But I knew all
through she didn’t care a d—— about me. And
that’s the way it occurred, old man.”
Hilliard’s hand met his.” “ Say no more about
it, Lamington ; it’s a mea mate, as we say here—a
thing that is past.”
“But, good God, old fellow, you don’t under-
stand. She’s written ever so many times to you. No
one in Levuka knew where you had gone to; there’s
thousands of islands in the South Seas. And
this letter here,” he held it toward him, “ she
gave to me, and I promised her on my honour as
a man to effect an exchange into the Petrel and
find you.”
“Thanks, Lamington. You always were a
good fellow.” He laid the letter on the table
quietly and rose and got the rum.
• # •
A young native girl, with deep lustrous
eyes shining from a face of almost childish inno-
cence, had entered the door and stood with one
bare and softly-rounded arm clasped round the
neck of Alberti’s little son. Her lips parted in a
smile as Lamington, with a gasping cough, set
down his glass after drinking the potent spirit, and
she set her brows in mock ferocity at Hilliard
who drank his down like an old-time beach-
comber.
“ By Jove, Hilliard, what an astonishingly
pretty face ! She could give any New Orleans
creole points. Time you got out of this before
some of the Rotumah beauties make you forget
things; and, oh, by the way, I’m forgetting
things. Remember you are to come aboard and
dine with us to-night, and that you’re in indifferent
health, and that Captain , of Her Majesty’s
ship Petrel, is going to give you a passage to
Sydney.”
At an angry sign from Hilliard the girl dis-
appeared. Then he shook his head. “No,
Lamington. I appreciate your kindness, but
cannot accept it. I’ve been here two years now
and Alberti, the principal local chief, thinks no
end of me ; and he’s a deuced fine fellow and has
been as good as ten fathers to me. And I’ve
business matters to attend to as well.”
• • *
Lamington pressed him no further.
“Lucky devil,” he thought. “I suppose he’ll
clear out in the trading schooner to Sydney, next
week ; be there long before us any way, and I’ll
find them well over the first stage of married
infatuation when I see him next.”
Another hour’s chat of old times and old ship-
mates in the Challenger, and Lamington, with his
honest, clean-shaven face looking into the quiet,
impassive features of the ex-officer, had gripped
his hand and gone, and Hilliard went over to the
house of Alberti, the chief, to drink kava —and
see the old French priest. From there, an hour
afterward, he saw the cruiser with wet, shining
sides dip into the long roll of the ocean swell, as
with the smoke pouring from her yellow funnel
she was lost to sight rounding the point.
* * *
Said the son of Alberti to Lela, the
innocent-faced girl with the dancing, starlike
eyes and red lips, as they stood watching the last
curling rings of the steamer’s smoke —“ And so
that is why I knew much of what the papalagi
from the man-of-war said to your Iliati; Alberti,
my father, has taught me much of your man’s
tongue. And, look thou, Lela the Cunning,
Iliati hath a wife in his own country !”
“Pah !”—and she shook her long, wavy looks
composedly, and then plucked a scarlet hibiscus
flower to stick in front of one of her pretty little
ears—“ what does that matter to me, fathead ? I
am she here; and when Iliati goeth away to her
she will be me there. But he loveth me more
than any other on Rotumah, and hath told me
that where he goeth I shall go also. And who
knowetli but that if I have a son he may marry
me? Then shalt thou see such a wedding-feast as
only rich people give. And listen : ’Tis well to
starve thyself now, for it may be to-morrow, for
look ! fathead, there goeth the priest into thy
father’s house, and Iliati is already there.”

“What’s the matter?” queried his wife,
sleepily.
“Only some murders, my dear,” answered the
newspaper-proprietor, crawling back into bed.
“ What a bother that they should ring you up,”
remarked his wife.
“Damn it!” said Jones, as he pulled up the
collar of his great-coat preparatory to a ten-mile
drive.
“ This ought to mean a sthripe fur me fur
certain,” pleasantly remarked the policeman (who
had captured the murderer) to the chemist
who was binding up his wounded finger.
“Why did I doit? Why did Ido it? I was
mad, mad !” said the murderer, as he tried to
scrape the dry blood from his hands on to the
wall.
“ Oh, my babies ! my poor babies,” wailed the
wretched mother as she bent over her murdered
little ones.

“Because the poor little darlings had kept
him awake for five nights, and he had to work
hard all day, as if that was any reason ! The brute
must be hanged,” shrieked the general public.
“I can nearly understand it,” said the man who
suffered from insomnia.
“Evidently insane,” said the doctor.
“ Guilty,” said the foreman of the jury.
“I concur with the verdict. . . . till you
are dead, and may the Lord have mercy on your
soul,” ended the Judge.
“ Remove the prisoner,” said the associate.
“The burthen the Lord has laid on me is a
heavy one,” wept the condemned man’s old
mother, as they led her from the court.
“Blast it! I suppose I’ll have to scrag’im,”
said the executioner (who was in receipt of a
regular salary).
