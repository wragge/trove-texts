The Red page
Drama.
Brieux, who regally dispenses with his
Christian name, proffers three more plays in
book-form, Woman on Her Own , False Gods,
and The Red, Robe ( per Angus and
Robertson, Sydney). These are all interest-
ing plays, more interesting than his Damaged
Goods. But the version of La Femme Beule
is, as Brieux admits in his preface, an emas-
culated one. The larger part of the third
act is unknown in France; but Brieux does
not think it advisable to “reproduce in its
entirety a text which certain timidities have
led me to emasculate.” Surely this should
not be so? The purchaser of a translation
has the right to get a proper translation,
especially of a drama, which certainly cannot
be judged in an emasculated form. Woman
on Her Own is too obviously a manufactured
“case.” It is an ante-bellum drama, and
therefore out of date. The revolution in the
economic position of woman wrought by this
war renders Brieux’ conclusions negligible.
Tligrese, an orphan about to be happily
married, loses all her money. Ren€, her
betrothed, offers to marry her without her
dotj but the opposition of Ms family is too
strong for this weak young man, wholly
dependent upon his father for his income
and future prospects, and he resigns her. So
Thgr&se determines to work for her own
living. She finds a job on a feminist paper,
Woman Fbee; but here she soon finds that
unless a girl is both pretty and—obliging she
cannot earn a decent wage. Here Brieux, in
order to allow the women on the paper to
give utterance to their views, and doubtless
to get a laugh by exposing the methods of
this sort of journal, makes us listen to these
girls telling each other things that they
already know—a stage convention that
apparently the French drama is still willing
to tolerate. When the editor of the paper is
compelled to halve the salaries of his em-
ployees, the girls recognise the inevitable.
“Middle-class girls thrown on the world as
we are can’t get along without a man: a
husband or a lover. We’ve not learned a
trade. We’ve learned to smile, and dance,
and sing—parlor tricks. All that’s only of
use in a love affair or a marriage. Without
a man we’re stranded. Our parents have
brought us all up for one career, and one
only. The man. I was a fool not to under-
stand before. Mow I see.... Since it’s an
accepted, settled, decided thing that the only
career for a woman is to satisfy the passions
of a man, I prefer the one I’ve ehosen
myself.” ~
The ugly woman scornfully tells the others
that they are only feminists when it’s con-
venient. “There are no real feminists ex-
cept ugly women like me, or old ones... .As
soon as a lover condescends to throw the
handkerchief, you’re up and off to him. You
want to be slaves.”
But Therese gets a good job in a binding
works in the provinces. She forms a union
of women employees, and at once there is
trouble. The male unionists object to the
women who take a lower wage. Thfirbse
puts the position neatly. “You don’t want
woman as housewife; and, as she refuses to
be a prostitute, she will become a woman-
worker, a competitor: and, finally, because
she has more energy than you have, and
because she is not a drunkard, she will take
yotfjflßlaees." The men’s delegate determine*
to mm the women’s union. The conse-
quencSis a fight between the representatives
of the women and the men, and Thdr&ses
employer is compelled, at the threat of strike
from the victorious men unionists, to dis-
miss his most valuable employee. So
ThSrese is forced back to the man. Rene
has made good, is eager to marry her, but
from pride she bas refused to marry him
agavist his parents’ wishes. So, without a
job, ~he goes to the train that will take her
to Paris as the mistress of Rend- To the
Australian mind, such a conclusion is need-
less tragedy. Ren6 wants to marry her, why
not let him? Apparently Thdrfese, from
empty pridev prefers to be his mistress rather
than his wife. . ~ , . ~
Brieux says of La Fot, which is rather
stupidly translated as False Gods, that this
play has cost him the most labor and the
most thought and time. The impulse came
to him to write it at the famous miracles of
Lourdes. It was only when on a visit to
Egypt that he saw the possibility of dis-
cussing religious questions in the theatre
without giving offence to various consciences.
go the scene is set in ancient Egypt, and
the drama calls for the most gorgeous set-
tings and Idle presence upon the stage of
great crowds. The hero, Satni, is a young
priest of the temple, who returns from a
iourney with the tidings that the old gods of
Isgvpt are false and that there is but one
true god. The girl he loves is eagerly await-
ing his return, hut she is chosen by the gods
to be the yearly sacrifice to propitiate the
goddess of the Nile. “Until tb-day I loved
von mor- than all the living things upon
the earth,” she says to her lover. Even
this day I dreaded being chosen of the gods.
But you are nothing to me now. How
could this be if the gods -had not willed it?
Satni vainly tries to prove to her that the
gods of Egvpt exist only because men have
Invented them. The girl is ecstatic and
exalted by the choice the gods have made of
her. The conflict between Yaouma and her
lover continues, because Satni has prevented
her from obeying the summons of the priests.
People begin to talk of a miracle wrought
by Satni, putting fear into the hearts of the
soldiers sent to take Yaouma. Then the
belief grows that Satni is himself a god, more
powerful than the old gods of Egypt. Satni
has destroyed the old gods, only to find him-
self elevated in their place. Yaouma herself
now looks on her lover as a god. When he
angrily insists that he is not a god, Yaouma
is sorely disappointed. “It would have been
more beautiful,” she sighs. “To go in the
barge, on the Nile (to my death), that, too,
had been more beautiful.” Satni is merely
the son of a potter, and his ruler, threatened
with death by Pharaoh, incites Satni to lead
a' rebellion against the priests. But Satni
will not kill. He is told by Rheon, his
employer: “If you would neither kill nor lie
you will never succeed hi governing men.
Profit by events. Do not deny the power
they believe to be yours. Men will not follow
you if you speak only to their reason....
You would lead them to the summits; to
get there, one must blindfold those who suffer
from dizziness.” And Rheon’s wife appeals
to Satni to work a miracle and cure her of
her blindness. “There are no miracles,” says
Satni. And he persuades the crowd to
destroy the household gods.
The mob breaks into excesses; the revolu-
tion descends into mere murder and pillage.
Rheou’s blind wife is dying, and comes for
comfort in her old beliefs to Satni. But he
has no comfort for her.
There is no Heaven nor Hell. Heaven
has been invented by the priests to keep the
poor contented with their miserable lot. They
will get the reward of their misery on earth
by their happiness in the Heaven promised
to them. The blind woman admits that she
would have died happy believing in a lie.
“What matter, I had smiled as I died, think-
ing death but the journey to a land where
my lost child was waiting for me. The death
of a child! No mother ever can believe, at
heart, in that. It is too unjust—too cruel to
be possible. Oh, Satni, thy doctrines may
be the truth. But they declare this separa-
tion eternal; they make the death of our
loved ones final, irreparable, horrible, there-
fore I foretell thee this: Women will never
believe them!” Yaouma, too, has gone back
to her old beliefs. And the blind woman
cries: “Oh, for a lie, some other lie, to
replace the one they have taken away from,
me! They have awakened my reason, and
killed my faith. I shall kill my reason, to
revive our gods.... If my god be false, I
shall believe so firmly in him that I shall
make him true! Gods! We need gods!
There are too many sorrows, it is not possi-
ble this earth should groan as it groans
beneath a pitiless Heaven. Ammon, reveal
thyself!”
Satni’s father, too, is dying. He, too,
demands his old faith. And Satni, in his
anguish, recants. He declares that “the
happy fields” of the Egyptian’s heaven exist,
but his father, dying, knows that there is no
Heaven. “And so this is a poor man s life!
Work from childhood, blows. Then work,
always, without profit. Only for bread. And
still work. For others. Not one pleasure.
We die. And ’tis finished! You came back
to teach me that —Work —blows —misery
the end.”
The next act shows us the interior of the
temple, even the mechanism by which the
yearly miracle is worked. Once each year-
the statue of the god bows to the people in
answer to their entreaties —and by means of
a hidden lever and some ropes. The High
Priest and Pharaoh are heard discussing
their religion, both officially and unofficially.
But the High Priest is a clever man. He
determines to bring Satni, whom he holds
prisoner, back to the old faith. He explains
to Satni: “We give to the people the gods
they can understand. Our god is different.
He is the one who exists in essence... .And
we crave his pardon for belittling him by
miracles. But thoy are part of. faith,
which alone contents the ? simple-minded.
You are above them —I admit freely that the
miracle could be, prevented. You have
declared it would not take place. Ana> in
proof of his belief in Satni, the High Priest
decides to appeal to the youth’s sense of pity.
He places Satni in charge of the mechanism
that works the alleged miracle, and when
the youth Sees the throng of the halt and the
maim and the paralysed and the miserable,
his pity for them is too great. He presses
the lever and the statue bows.
Then Satni confesses to the mob that he
has deceived them. There are no miracles.
He did it out of pity. The people say that
they have no need of his pity. And batm
replies that they had need only of his cour-
age. “T 6 still a few sobs, to give hope to
some who were stricken, I worked the
miracle; and beholding that false miracle,
you mud© submission. I have conformed, l
have strengthened the empire of the 1ie....
We go forward only by destroying. Natu-
rally the people slay him.
For English readers La Robe Rouge, being
a criticism of French judicial proceedings,
suffers from the drawback that the proce-
dure is quite unlike that of English courts.
Brieux explains that had he been an English
citizen, instead of writing a play against the
abuse of justice by a Judge, he might have
had to illustrate the same abuse by the
lawyer. However, his translator has done
iris best by using such terms as “the distinct
attorney,” “the attorney-general,” etc., tor
court officials for whose _ real titles there is
no close English translation. .
The plot turns on the necessity for the
Judge and other members of a provincial
Court to secure convictions, in order to
secure their own promotion to higher courts,
and to get their Court raised to a higher
class. And this session, as the members ot
the Court confess in despair, there have been
three acquittals, while a murderer is stall at
large. The Court is falling behind other
courts of the same class. It is necessary for
the Court that the murderer must be found
and condemned to death. _ A death sentence
would set the Court on its feet again. The
result is the arrest of an innocent man
charged with the murder, and the efforts oi
the Judge to get him convicted. This affords
Brieux the opportunity to write a remark-
ably brilliant drama, in which he shows up
the deficiencies of French justice in a. eas-
terly way. As drama The Red Rohe i» the
finest thing in this volume. And that is
great praise.
How to Write
Literature is not a mere science, to be
studied, but an art, to be practised, .threat
as is our own literature, we must consider it
as a legacy to be improved. Our job, as
writers, is to better the past, to write better
than, say, Shakespeare. That is the gist or
the charming series of lectures that. Arthur
Quiller-Couch, finding himself appointed a
professor of English Literature at Cam-
bridge, delivered to his, surely, delignted
students. On the Art of Writing (Univer-
sity Press, Cambridge, per Angus and
Robertson, Sydney, 10s. here) consist*
of these brilliant but conversational lectures
in book form. They are worthy of the study
of every writer, and deserve, indeed, an even
wider audience, since they are. written in a
seductive style and informed with that quite
unprofessional attribute, humor.
Quiller-Couch has no time for the peda-
gogue, whose hopeless obsession is that Eng-
lish is a dead language. “Hence the Eng-
lish (and Australian) schoolboy starts .with
a false perspective of any given masterpiece,
his pedagogue urging, obtruding lesser things
upon his vision until what is really import-
ant, the poem or the play itself, is seen in
distorted glimpses, if not quite blocked out
of view.” , . , . ,
So the English professor exhorts his stu-
dents to write, to practise the art of writ-
ing, even to write verse. Quiller-Couch is
wise enough not to lay down rules; but he
does succeed in distinguishing verse from
prose. “Verse is by nature (and origin)
more emotional than prose.” Hence the
capital difficulty of verse consists in saying
ordinary things, while the capital difficulty
of prose consists in saying extraordinary
things; while with verse, keyed for high
moments, the trouble is to manage the in-
tervals, with prose the trouble is to manage
the high moments.” But, in studying litera-.
ture, and still more in studying to write it,
Quiller-Couch reiterates his warning, Dis-
trust all classification!” “All classifying of
literature intrudes ‘science’ upon an art,
and is artificially ‘scientific’; a trick of
pedants.... Beetles, minerals, gases, may
be classified; and to have classified them is
not only convenient but a genuine advance
In knowledge. But if you had to moles a
beetle, as men are making poetry, how much
would classification help?... .To classify
when you come to an art is at best an
expedient, useful to some critics and to a
multitude of examiners.” ■„ . .
This professor has no doubts at all about
which is “not only intrinsically but histori-
cally out and away the greatest book of Eng-
lish prose”: The Authorised Version of the
Bible. Quiller-Couch practically terms this
production The Miracle of the 47 Gentlemen.
Tyndale, who gave the committee a basis
for their version, was a genius, and Wyclif
before him was a genius. But how did that
committee of 47 gentlemen become a com-
mittee of geniuses? For outside this work
of theirs, none of the 47 were known for
any superlative talent. “That a large com
mittee of 47 should have gone. steadily
through the great mass of Holy Writ, seldom
interfering with genius, yet, when interfer-
ing, seldom missing to improve: that a com-
mittee of 47 should have captured (or even
should have retained and improved) a
rhythm so personal, so constant, that our
Bible hus the voice of one author speaking
through its many mouths: that is a won-
der before which I can only stand humble
and aghast The Authorised Version set
a seal on our national style, thinking and
speakihg.” In short, it established our lit-
erature. All the more reason, says this
cheerful professor, why we shouldn’t go
ahead and make a better literature. As
Shaw urged, “Better than Shakespeare?
Well, why not? English Literature isn’t
dead, though its coffin can be discovered in
any of our Universities.
And, hurriedly, in his next lecture, Quiller-
Couch explains that by the word “miracle”
he meant nothing but that the thing was,
to him, marvellous. He has no idea of
“making a fetich of the book.” For he
points out that occasionally the 47 gentle-
men wrote stark nonsense, as The Revised
Testament proved.
I As showing how the various authors hsyje
rendered the Bible, Quiller-Couch offers us
these versions:—
Wyclif translates: “Deeth, where is thi
victorie? deeth, where is thi prieke?”
Tyndale: “Deeth, where is thy stynge t
Hell, where is thy victory?”
The Authorised Version: O Deatn,
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory ?”
But Quiller-Couch has to lay down certain
rules, not for writing prose, but to help us
in the way of straight prose.
1. Almost always prefer the concrete word
to the abstract. ,
2. Almost always prefer the direct word
to the circumlocution.
3. Generally use transitive verbs, that
strike their object; and use them m the
active voice, eschewing the stationary pas-
sive, with its little auxiliary is’s and. teas s,
arid its participles getting into the light ot
your adjectives, which should be few. i or,
as a rough law, by his use of the . straight
verb and by his economy of adjectives you
can tell a man’s style, if it be masculine or
neuter, writing or “composition.”
Upon that difficult ground of literary
style Quiller-Couch naturally treads deli-
cately. He tells us many things that style
is not. Certainly it can never be extraneous
ornament. “Whenever you feel an impulse
to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine
writing, obey it —whole-heartedly- and
delete it before sending your manuscript to
press. Murder your darlings Literature
is a living art, therefore it must be personal
and of its essence personal. Your style is
yourself. "Every man of us constructs his
sentences differently.” 'And Quiller-Couch
has no prejudice against the admission ot
new words into the language. “Generally,
it is better to err on the side of liberty than
on the side of the Censor: since by the
manumitting of new words we infuse new
blood into a tongue of which (or we have
learnt nothing from Shakespeare’s audacity)
our first pride should be that it is flexible,
alive, capable of responding to new demands
I of man’s untiring quest after knowledge and
experience.” And you must read his anec-
dote to understand this professor when he
says that "the first and last secret of a good
•tyle consists in' thinking with the heart
as well as the head.” The business ot
writing demands two —the author and the
reader. Hence the author is under the obli-
gation to put himself into his reader’s place.
To express ourselves is a very small part of
the business; we must impress ourselves,
“the aim of the whole process being to
persuade. All reading demands an effort.
Therefore put no. further difficulties in the
reader’s way. Be lucid, be careful, be
courteous. “Style in writing is much the
same thing as good manners m other human
intercourse.”
Of Quiller-Couch’s inimitable discourse
upon “Jargon” this page will speak another
day.
War
“Sapper” deserves his immense popularity
as a writer of trench yarns. His latest col-
lection, Men, Women and Guns ('Hodder and
Stoughton, per Sydney Book Club), is
pleasant war-fiction. For “Sapper” merely
uses the trench and the dugout as a back-
ground for his rather conventional stories,
but he differs from the popular magazine
fictionists by making his background real and
frequently grim. The author has evidently
experienced all that he writes of the war.
“The Land of Topsy Turvy,” however, is
something better than the magazine war-
story. This, a convincing essay upon the
psychology of the soldier, shows how the
war changes an ordinary Englishman—
casual, sporting, easy-going, somewhat apa-
thetic —into a being who can deliberately
drive a pick through a screaming German
caught red-handed in an act of callous
treachery.
£
A Diary of the Great Warr, by Sami.
Pepys, Junr., Esquire, M.A. (Lane, per
Dymock’s Library), is excellent. fooling. This
parody of the great Pepys is brilliantly
done* and not alone by the imitation of his
style and spelling. For Sami, is obviously a
direct descendant of the great Pepys; he
takes an intelligent interest in the great
affairs of the day—his diary runs from July,
1914, to the end of 1915—-but he is equally
interested in his own personal affairs, and he
has no less capacity than his ancestor for
judicious amours. Apart from its fooling,
this publication will have some historical
value, since it will recall for future readers
the absurd rumors that were so striking a
feature of the early days of the war. Sami.
Pepys has a quick ear and credulous ear for
rumors. But the diary is merely for dipping
into. Too much Sami.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
) direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
i were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action'is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
s.bottle in the house.

MR. T. I. CAMPBELL,
General Secretary Farmers 8 Settlers’ Association of New South Wales,
one of the best-known of Sydney’s commercial citizens, having held this important
position for years, gives this voluntary testimony to Clements Tonic, because he
states it merits it: —•
“Farmers and Settlers’ Association, N.S.W.,
“7 O’Connell St,, Sydney, 27/7/’l6.
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.,
“Knowing the value of Clements Tonic from personal use and
experience, I do not hesitate to give you my opinion of it, simply
putting into words what I have so often spoken.
“I believe it to be a very fine blood and nerve tonic. I know
that it has benefited me greatly. At various periods my duties are
exceptionally heavy, involving great mental and nervous strain, and
I have always found your medicine of the greatest value to me,
having singularly invigorating and recuperative properties.
“I make a point of recommending Clements Tonic to many of
my friends, as I feel desirous of enabling others to benefit by my
personal experience.
“(Signed) T. I. CAMPBELL,
“General Secretary.”
It is questionable whether there is any man better or more widely known than the able
Secretary of this far-reaching Association, the influence of which extends over the entire State,
and whose members amongst the pastoral and farming communities of New South Wales are
to be numbered in thousands. To all of these Mr. Campbell’s letter will appeal, as equally
as it will to his numberless commercial city friends, because of its sincerity and lucid explana-
tion of the worth of a medicine the effectiveness of which is felt and recognised throughout
the Australian Commonwealth.
It is truly the medicine for the man on the land. Send for it if you suffer
from Insomnia, Poor Appetite, Weak Nerves, or Brain Fag. ALL CHEMISTS.

GREAT DANGER OF INSECT BITES.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers by Using NEV-A-BITE.
A Preparation of Proved Effectiveness.
“There is no question,” says a leading specialist,
“that insect bites may lead to great danger to
health, and have been known to end fatally.”
The dread Mosquito,
whose bite is perhaps
the most dangerous of
all insects.
This alarming
statement, which
has appeared in
the influential
newspapers of this
country, should
arouse the public
to the fact that
bites from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
to worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one’s
blood is in a poor
state an insect bite
might set up such
serious infiamma-
tion as to cause blood-poisoning, and —as every-
one- well knows —blood-poisoning may lead to
even the amputation of a limb.
The best form of treatment of mosquito
bites is prophylactic or preventive. The appli-
cation of a little ’of the NEV-A-BITE
lotion reduces the probability of mosquito bites
to a minimum.
NEV-A-BITE is a perfectly harmless
preparation, and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.
If NEV-A-BITE is unobtainable from
your local supplier, send 1/2 in stamps to one
of the following, viz:—
Duerdin & Sainsbury, Flinders Lane, Melbourne.

What we call courage is
nearly always primarily a

man who shows the great-

THE man who takes half a teaspoonful of Kruschen Salts

freely in his veins; he goes to his work refreshed, alert,

Softly bathed in starry light;
On the gleaming earth a garden
Sleepeth sweet, all flower-bedight.
Dear earth, good-night!
In the garden stands a cottage
Girt with vine and glimmering white;
And a dark-winged bird is warbling,
’Neath the window, soft good-night.
Dear cot, good-night!
In the chamber dreams a maiden,
Dreams of flowers all fairy-bright;
Pure and peaceful beats her bosom —
Angels guard her through the night!
Dear love, good-night!

As a flower unfurls
In the warming sunshine—
Girl of girls !
If I’d find your symbol,
All your beauty speak,
Jewel-shop and garden

When I look on jewels,
All in love with them,

Just a gem!
When I’m in a garden
Where the noontide glows,
Girl of girls, I think you
Just a rose!
Gem in golden setting,
Rose on dewy spray—
You are they—and something
More than they!
Reddest of red roses,
Purest of pure pearls—
These and more I think you,

The Ants’ Belief.
The ants had held the place their own;
But came a monster with a spade,
And earthquakes shifted soil' and stone.
Then rose some ants in black arrayed,
When from the spot the still-live fled,
“ ’Tis our sin’s punishment,” they said.
They built a newer ant-heap near
An older, hostile settlement;
And bitterness grew, year by year,
And angry words, and discontent,
Until, with hearts with hate aflame,
The warring ants to battle came.
The learn&d ants with verse and text
Showed each how his side held the right,
And how the spade-armed god was vext
Against the others in the fight:
“God fights within our ranks,” they cried,
“And simply hates the other side.”
To battle grim the legions rushed,
Each side proclaiming God approved;
And then a boot, unconscious, crushed
Into their hosts, and onward moved
Still crushing ants, and did not bother
To pick out one side from the other.

BENZINE
PLUME
Your car pulls better
at night time. Why ?
Before petrol vapor can ignite, it must be
mixed with oxygen, of which ordinary air
contains a large proportion. The function
of the carburetor is to mi* the petrol vapor
with air in the proportions which will give
the best result. The carburetor can take
in only a certain volume of air, and as the
night air contains more oxygen than air in
the daytime—a more powerful mixture is
always made at night, and your car pulls
better in consequence.
Plume Benzine
Easy starting—Sweet running—More miles
The more air your Motor Spirit will take,
the cheaper the running cost. Plume is
remarkable for the large amount of air it
takes, which makes it highly economical,
as air costs you nothing. “Plume” gives
more miles to the gallon, is easy starting,
and ensures a clean cylinder.
Correct Lubrication
Gargoyle Mpbiloils seal the clearance of the piston
and give full lubrication. There is a special grade
of Mobiloil specially manufactured for your car.

MOVING TOWARDS BUSINESS
GOVERNMENT.
A sudden change in British politics has in-
volved the resignation of Asquith and the
arrival of Lloyd George as Prime Minister
in collaboration with Bonar Law. However
the new combination may work, the fact
stands plainly that England is out for Busi-
ness Government, and that the sacred rights
of political humbug are crumbling before a
stern demand for the effective prosecution
of the war. The cabled information that
neither Woodrow Wilson nor the Pope can
talk peace in the present temper of Britain
is a .pretty sure indication that the nation
wants to argue the matter out with the
Kaiser with all its blood and breath in the
effort; and nothing is more evident than that
party is an impossible handicap when the
fighting is “all in.” Hitherto a Coalition
Cabinet has been conducting affairs —a group
of men selected for their party prominence
rather than because they possessed special
aptitude for the task. Grave lawyers nicely
balancing each proposal made, finding objec-
tions to every downright action and with a
natural legal bias in favor of delay, have
been the prominent feature of the council
table when the violent hand of the murderer
was at the peasant’s throat and the Teuton,
snorting a tremendous “Gott strafe,” was
laying waste lands that looked to England
for aid. The aid was never there in time to
stay the slaughter; and the objection which
the legal mind raised to doing things was
seldom removed until it was too late to do
them. All this was the direct legacy of
the allegedly-dead party system. The fury
of Parliamentary warfare had ceased, but
the minds which had triumphed in that petty
warfare were still active and still applying
the methods of the lobby and party commit-
tee to problems that could only be tackled
with a large and sharp axe.
* * * *
But national feeling, wrought to white
heat by defeats and despairs and successes
too small to shake the enemy, was gradually
drafting the sheep from the goats and recog-
nising the men who could get forward from
the men who believed that their strength lay
in sitting tight. Lloyd George, active,
imaginative, courageous and, if blundering,
always blundering towards the light, began
to fill a tremendous place in the British
thought. He had conquered a democracy
that once greeted him with the dead cat of
derision, and. he had tongue-thrashed the
Dukes into blind fury; but with the progress
of the war he began to gather around him
friendly samples of Duke until practically
everything that was entitled to wear jewel-
lery on its bald head was ready to eat out
of his hand. Fight was fight and the war
was made out of fight; and, when England
began to wear black for its dead hereditary
peerage which had half-justified centuries
of plunder by a ready and splendid sacrifice
in the big shambles, the heart of the people
turned to a man who looked as if he wanted
to hit and hit hard. But in prosecuting the
war Lloyd George has found himself unable
to get past the quibbles of the legal mind at
the council table; and now, with a swift
Cromwellian move, he has overturned the
table itself, pushed the chief lawyer out of
the room and at the moment of writing is
forming a new Ministry, with the help of
the leader of his ancient foes, in which his
own energetic and fearless Will may have
freer action. For the first time the selec-
tion is on business lines and party is for-
gotten. The nation will see an executive coun-
cil with its coat off and its shirt-sleeves rolled
up, and it will be a lot less concerned about
its own loss of sweat in consequence. Even
though the new Government should fail and
the war make no better progress under it
than it has done in the past,' the people will
at least have the satisfaction of knowing that
the last possible thing has been tried and
that, if the result is not all th'at might be
desired, it is the best that the country can
achieve. In a word, Britain is to have
something like a National Government and,
once it has that, the return to the battledore
and shuttlecock of the party game should be
impossible. The business Cabinet which is
best for war must be best for mending up
the wreckage of war also.
* * * *
If Australia could learn the same lesson
before it is rammed down her throat by the
violence of circumstance, we might get out
of the bog in which we now appear to be
stuck. If England finds it necessary to
put aside Asquith and drop Balfour
from the War Cabinet, how much more
necessary is it for us to get rid of
feeble persons like Cook and Pearce?
Asquith has many fine qualities of leader-
ship, and Balfour, on his attainments out-
side politics, is perhaps the biggest man of
the whole group who have lately held office.
Cook, Pearce and a lot of those who have
helped to block Australia’s path have no
qualifications whatever either in or out of
politics that lift them at all above the low
Parliamentary average. Cook, by a series
of accidents which removed abler men,
became head of a party; Pearce, stodgy and
without a spark of imagination, somehow
or other stumbled into the job which should
have been reserved for the strongest and most
inspired administrator in Australia. The
only hope of better things is to remove the
weaklings and put the strong men in office,
altogether regardless of party. Unfortunately
there is nobody about with the whirlwind
zeal and energy of a Lloyd George to
trample traditions dowfi and insist that these
things must be done. Yet within its own
limits the matter is as urgent here as in
London, and the destructive virus of party
is more active among us than ever it was in
the land that disembowelled itself on the
edge of an imported bale of shoddy while
praying to its Freetrade joss. That Free-
trade joss is now on the scrap-heap and
party is being sent along to the destructor
with enthusiasm, while we, with a continent
to develop and a mighty future hanging on
our immediate actions, cling miserably to
tradition and confess ourselves unable to
invent a means by which we can be governed
by our brains instead of our feet. We, too,
have our share in the war, and our good
fighting men at the Front are being left
bitterly unsupported. Our industrial trou-
bles, solved for the moment by Ethelred-
the-Unready’s ancient plan of throwing pub-
lic cash at the dange». are liable to burst out
at any moment. The need for Business
Government here is as great as in England.
Party has still got us by the throat and the
strong man resolute with the axe. is our
great national need, even if in using the
weapon he should have to smash the Consti-
tution and most of the Ten Commandments.
THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE
CASH-BOX.
The sum and substance of the financial
statement produced by Treasurer Poynton
last week was that the Hughes Ministry
proposes to, in the main, go along the lines
laid down by W. G. Higgs before the earth-
quake. The intentions of Higgs have been
changed only in detail. There is to be a War
Profits Tax annexing three-quarters of the
excess instead of collaring the lot —restraint
designed to encourage the profiteer to go on
making profits—a rise in the income tax, a tax
on amusement tickets, excluding those under
6d. in value, and the giving of five. years for
the payment of the levy for repatriation pur-
poses instead of three. When it is all boiled
down to figures, Poynton expects to raise
£1,750,000 less by taxation than Higgs
hoped for. Then by reducing the sinking-
fund payments by £1,445,222, knocking a bit
off the huge appropriation for the Home
Affairs or Works Department and spend-
ing half a million less of revenue on the
military and naval establishments, the Higgs
expenditure is cut by £2,413,807. There is
nothing much to brag about in this, for in
view of the huge military expendi-
ture from loans ■ and the farcical
nature of the sinking funds, the im-
provement is more or less of a rumor. The
distance between the tip of a dog’s nose
and the end of its tail can be easily varied if
between the first and second measurements a
couple of feet of tail are chopped off and
given to the animal for breakfast. And so it
is with this reduction of payments to a
spurious sinking fund. The “saving” on one
page of the book will be counterbalanced by
more loan being entered up on another.
* * * *
As the statement of a Treasurer immersed
in consideration of one subject only, and
that to get cash by any possible means so
long as the method looks easy, Poynton’s
yarn is as good as could have been expected
from anybody else in the same position. There
is no pretence that the methods now being
followed have any element of permanency.
The speech was a yarn about a drift, with
some horrible-looking rocks ahead. Higgs in
his Budget of May apologised for raising
£13,200,000 by Customs duty, and announced
that the Government “had no wish to con-
tinue receiving so large a sum.” By Sep-
tember he reckoned that he would receive
£13,500,000, but forgot to be apologetic. Now,
Poynton comes along and remarks that the
receipts will probably be £13,750,000, and
appears to be glad. This is the great blot on
the balance-sheet —that of a total revenue
from taxation and services of £37,679,290,
so much as £17,000,000 should be raised
by Customs and excise. It represents
national waste in its worst form, and the
dependence also of the Treasurer upon waste.
If the tariff were doing what it should be
doing, the thing would be impossible. The
scale of importations is prodigal to the last
degree, and this £17,000,000 is what the
public pays the Government for continuing to
shirk its plain duty. The country and the
public lose on the deal. Ministries that per-
sist in raising £2O by Customs and income
tax for every £1 10s. they get by land tax
are doing something for which even a plaus-
ible defence cannot be found.
* * * *
Poynton speaks about the necessity for
prudence in expenditure. He will have to do
something more than talk about it. The
essential facts in connection with national
finance are that expenditure has by the twin
influences of profligate administration and
war leaped up to a point that no one ever
dreamed of, that the interest bill to be met
every year is colossal, and that the country
is importing far more goods than it can pay
for except with additional p.n’s. And as the
additional p.n. is becoming a drug in the
market, and the anxiety of Cohen to oblige
us has evaporated, either a sharp curve has
to be taken or we go over the precipice.
Nothing is more certain. By next year the
public debt of the Commonwealth and the
States will be in the vicinity of £600,000,000,
and demanding payment of well over
£22,000,000 a year, to which Propputy repre-
sented by millions of war bonds will contri-
bute nothing at all. If to this be added the
cost of carrying on seven Parliaments, sup-
porting about 165 departments, sustaining
numerous Cocked Hats, meeting Defence re-
quirements, making good the losses on a
variety of public enterprises, keeping a High
Commissioner and six Agents-General in good
condition, pouring money dowm a sink in the
Northern Territory, losing copiously on the
Post Office, and otherwise finding the proceeds
for running multitudinous essential and
superfluous persons and institutions, includ-
ing the local Bumble, it seems a fair thing to
conclude that the Australian citizen is going
td be called on to part with considerably
more of his earnings than may be convenient
to hand over. Poynton knows it, and puts
it this way:—
There has been no period in our history that has
been more prosperous than the past 10 years, and
this may account for the revel in public expenditure
which is still rampant in both the Commonwealth
and the State activities. The time has surely arrived
when we should call a halt and prepare for the
aftermath that is certain to follow this world-wide
war.
But there is no evidence yet anywhere in
Australia that the politician is ready to
attack his job with anythin? but words, or to
honestly try to prevent what he calls the
“aftermath of war.”
* * * *
It is lamentable that among l!he people of
Australia a faith in the possibilities of the
country should be operating to prevent the
Commonwealth getting a fair deal. “Oh, it
is a great country—marvellous ! wonderful!
A few good seasons will put matters right.”
This is the cheerful commentary of the aver-
age elector. The newspapers bleat about the
great influx of population that we may
expect. Long, circumstantial stories are
spun about the high prices that will be com-
manded by Australian products when the
causes that have kept them high cease to
operate. All this is hideouslv dangerous, on
about the same level of intelligence as the
cocksure war-rubbish which filled Australian
mouths not long ago. No matter how rich
the country might be nor how favorable the
seasons may become, it is madness to suppose
that a population of 5,000,000, saddled with
such obligations as are on Australia to-day,
can continue so wild a revel. The talk about
“influxes” and “prices” is mere nonsense.
Whether the Parliaments of Australia like it
or not they cannot get away from this —that
the world is changing before their eyes, and
that unless they promptly bring their rank
careers to an end and stop the fatuous policy
of, wastage on imports, and get down to
recognition of the stern, hard fact that Aus-
tralia has to work for a living and for her
future, they will be guilty of a criminal con-
spiracy against the nation,
THE HUMAN NOTE IN ANARCHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Foe ten days the Central Criminal Court
at Darlinghurst has been the scene of a trial
destined to figure as one of the most im-
portant in the Commonwealth’s history.
For ten days the sombre hall has seen
crowded galleries, every press-seat full,
counsel’s table brimming; the black-robed
associate, and, apparently cool in the hottest
weather, the Judge in scarlet and ermine,
grey of beard and grey of wig; and in the
centre the dock filled with the twelve.
Allowing for the pallor of the prison dur-
ing a tedious remand, and the weariness of
the long trial, one would say, looking at
these men of the 1.W.W., that their out-
standing feature was in most cases cupidity
and retreating chins, with great quantities
of hair upon their heads. Yet all were
clean-shaven but Hamilton, and only one
man was slightly bald. Here were King, a
Canadian, already serving a sentence for
bank-note forgery, defending himself and
but clumsily—a cold man with none ot the
magnetism of either Larkin the Irishman
or Donald Grant of Scotland; Larkin ot
the black, Irish-Spanish type, lus hair grey-
ing, his nose big and dominating and
almost grotesque for size, suggesting a
Stentorello, one of those comic singers ot
Italian streets that wear a false nose to
broaden the joke.; Grant, an earnest-faced,
deep-eyed man, his hair a shock of fiery red ;
Hamilton, a weak, thin man, wearing steel-
rimmed spectacles on his nose, saying he
had been laid aside by lead-poisoning;
Besant, a young man whose face was curi-
ously dented across the eye-line, like a pot
spoiled in the burning. The others seemed
so dull as to be children —criminal children,
maybe; but mentally immature. But of all
the faces of the I.W.W. none were worse
than the faces of those who turned King s
evidence on the treason charge and that of
the forged bank-notes.
So the trial lasted 10 days, with the wives
of three of the prisoners always there, as
close to the police-guarded dock as might be.
At half-past three on Friday afternoon
the jury retired, and at intervals over the
five hours of waiting that sombre court
heard light talk and laughter. The wives
of three of the prisoners, after the 10 days
of waiting, seemed to have found new hope
in the mere absence of the jury and silence
of the court. They are ail thin women:
Teen’s wife, almost blind, and with a baby
four months old; Larkin’s wife, a little,
tired, faded woman, who had been in Aus-
tralia only two days when her husband
was arrested ; Glynn’s wife, an Australian
with two children. In the long waiting
they seemed to be almost happy, as if con-
fident of the result. Perhaps it was that
they were permitted to go close to the dock.
Chatter, silence, expectancy, false alarm;
a door opens to admit nothing of import-
ance ; shadows blackening in the court
corners; tension that was almost pain;
chatter; silence, and tension that hurt
again. At last, the jury returned, the Judge
on the bench once more, in crimson and
ermine; the women leaning forward breath-
lessly ; the men ifi the dock moistening their
lips as if they could not hear without that.
“Charles Reeve, guilty on the first and
third counts.”
“Thomas Glynn, on all three counts.”
(The cry of a woman in agony—one cry
and quiet sobbing.)
“Peter Larkin, guilty on the first and
third counts.”
(“God save him! God save him!”)
“John Benjamin King, on the last
count.”
“Bernard Besant, on the first and third
counts.”
“Thomas Moore, on the first and third
counts.”
“Donald McPherson, Donald Grant,
William Teen”
(A scream, and Teen’s wife taken out
sobbing.)
“William- Beattie, Morris Joseph
Fagin”
(Another scream. So Fagin the Russian
was not all friendless.)
“——and John Hamilton, on all three
counts.”
A sigh of staring horror arose from the
dock; women shrieked and children wailed
in sympathy for their mothers.
While the police cleared the court of their
womenfolk the prisoners were openly
affected, crying for the sorrow of their
mates. Yet people whom the I.W.W. might
have injured, had they no beloved also?
It is known of Robespierre that his pri-
vate life was irreproachable, and that he
was so beloved of his friends that many
wished to die with him.
The women were carried away; their
shrieks echoed through the corridors. The
shaken prisoners, remanded for sentence,
descended through the floor of the dock to
despair, there to wait the morrow and the
sentence. Without, hundreds of sympa-
thisers talked of effecting an eleventh-hour
rescue. But the police were tactical, and
the crowd drifted until it was nothing.
Saturday morning the police held all
points by the Criminal Court. Uniformed
and plain-clothes men were in the streets
and approaches, and surrounded the dock.
The prisoners ascended to the court,
quieter for the night, and, as human nature
is after a strain, glad that the anxiousness
of uncertainty had gone—now replaced by
another and greater anxiety of the duration
of punishment.
In those men as they sat there you might
see one of the distorted results of the sys-
tem that founded Australia in the bad old
days—days as late as 1830, when a boy
aged 15 arrived in Sydney sentenced by an
English Judge to transportation for life for
stealing a pair of shoes. For if such laws
have changed radically in Britain and
Ireland, many of the conditions had not
prior to the war. It was but the irony of
things that these men should select the best
country in the world for the worker to
preach the doctrines that we laughed at
until we saw they were serious.
The weary prisoners awaited the Judge;
and the farce of speeches against sentence
proceeded though the sentences had been
already decided. Most of the men spoke
little. Teen passionately alluded to the
Goldsteins preparing evidence to escape
their own punishment in the bank-note
cases; Moore said with apparent candor
that lie was a stranger to the men he was
accused of conspiring with, wffiich if true
is terrible; Beattie, that when he was
born he was sentenced to imprisonment for
life, and that no other sentence could
frighten him. King spoke last; not the
enthusiast this, but a cold man singing a
swan song of platitudes, yet earnest enough
in his belief that the working-class is
scrapped when it has exhausted its use.
Grant and Larkin have real eloquence
and believe all they say. Grant, very
Scotch in' tone and manner, quoted Bruno’s
death at the stake for saying the world
was round. As he spoke a long ray of light
came from the window in the roof of the
court and seemed to follow his hand. As
yet another fold of cloud rolled up the ray
travelled to his face ; and he spoke with a
head and hand of light. “I am no con-
spirator. I hate conspiracies because I
know that everything that is secret must
fail.” As Larkin rose you saw a small man


with a big head—the head of a giant on
the stunted body of an ill-fed man. His
nose lost the character of Stentorello; the
great head became tragic; the lips Jost
their sardonic humor; the eyes filled with
a knowledge of the misery of the world.
Wrong he is; actor he may be; but he
believes all he says. “Would I have done
these things while sending to Ireland for
my wife and child?” he asked. And at
the end he came back to the family—“l
leave my case to my class and my wife and
child in their arms.” Men with the opinions
of 1848 from a country where the treatment
of the poor is cold and callous, failing to
see that Australia lives in the year 1916.
So silence, with only the Judge’s pen
scratching as he wrote the varying quali-
ties of doom; the doomed waiting, and the
locusts singing outside in liberty, there
being neither Capital nor Labor in the
trees, but only pure Communism. The
cool Judge states the sentences — Glynn,
Hamilton, McPherson, Beattie, Fagin,
Grant, Teen, 15 years; Reeves. Larkin,
Besant and Moore, 10 years; King, five
years.
They took it quietly, shook hands with
counsel, gave friends the last note home
and went down to the cell below to think
“Good-bye” to the women who nearly died
when they heard the verdict yesterday.
They were not permitted to hear the sen-
tence. Teen’s wife, almost blind, crying
herself blind more quickly, went towards
Paddington; Larkin’s wife faded out of
the crowd; only the wife of Glynn stayed
about to see the last, represented by the
prison van goine slowly through the crowd,
cheered from without and cheering from
within. The police smiled sympathetically
as the van departed with the men who had
to pay the price.
But not all the price! Down Oxford-
street walked a thin, pale woman with two
children wailing tearlessly because her
husband had mixed himself with a policy of
Anarchy. Whenever man is in trouble there
is almost always a woman to drag to
greater. So the prisoners fade out of the
world, and the mourners, like lost children,
go about the streets.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Will Somebody Import a Cannibal, or a
Bulldog?
Unless Australia lets a hungry cannibal
and a bulldog loose in the neighoorhood of
the national cashbox it looks as if the poli-
tician is going to annex the contents in
broad daylight. This latest business of King
O’Malley handing round gold railway-passes
to a crowd of deadheads, and following that
up with a furtive invitation to members of
the Commonwealth Parliament to accept
tickets at the public expense for trips to
Maoriland (wives included), clamors for
protective measures out of the common.
O’Malley had no moral right to do either
thing. He should have had no power to do
them. He would not have had it, either,
if the Parliamentary control over the Com-
monwealth funds was anything but a jest.
What happens actually is that money is
shovelled out first and authority for getting
rid of it secured afterwards. The' conse-
quence is a carnival of waste and a prosti-
tution of patronage that can end in one
thing only. And yet this O’Malley person,
with the railway-pass and steamer-ticket
grab thick upon him, had the audacity to
vote in the House of Reps, on a want-of-
confidence motion! In a healthy state of
public opinion the granting of doles out of
the cash-box to politicians and their wives
would be regarded simply as larceny.
For that reason this paper is waiting to hear
the names of the men who have returned
the railway passes handed to them by the
O’Malley. It is also waiting to hear who
applied for steamer tickets and who got
away with one before the free-ticket plank
in the platform of the Commonwealth Min-
istry was removed. It is waiting also to
hear whether the party to which O’Malley
has attached himself like a barnacle has
enough sand in it to disown him. Of course,
at rock-bottom, the unacclimatised Yank is
not so much to blame as the system which
permits these things. So long as they are
possible it is 100 to 1 that they will be per-
petrated—if not by O’Malley then by some-
one else. The passion of the politician for get-
ting something on the nod can only be kept in
check by a bulldog that will publicly tear
him to pieces if he tries to take it. So
pressing is the need for this animal that The
Bulletin waives its objection to imported
tykes and recklessly blows the consequences.
Solomon, Arbitrator and Cashier.
The Bulletin earnestly invites all good
democrats, conservatives and members of
secret juntas, all men, women and kids, to
arise and give three cheers for the latest
method of settling labor disputes. There is
now no reason why there should ever be
any more for longer than five minutes.
A Solomon has arisen in the land,
and with ope comprehensive sweep of
the judicial wig he has cleared away all the
cobwebs that decorated the industrial courts
and simplified arbitration to a mechanical
process. Judge Edmunds, who settled the
general coal strike by giving the coal-owners
a claim on the public purse, subsequently
approached the job of fixing up an isolated
dispute at the Bulli Colliery as a side-line.
The stoppage of work hinged on a conflict
about payment of £lB for work in what
are known as deficient places. The men
wanted the money before returning to work ;
the owner _ said it was not due. Edmunds,
having satisfied himself that an investigation
into the merits of the dispute would occupy
a week, paid the money himself, “with right
of recourse to the Federal Government for
a refund.” Whereupon the men went back
to toil, the owner said “Right-oh” and
Edmunds vanished amidst loud applause.
This method of dealing with industrial dis-
turbances adds a chapter—surely a final
chapter—to the history of experiment. The
rest is now easy, and the public may expect
to find something concise in the morning
papers. For instance:—
WATERSIDERS SATISFIED.
Rail and Tramway Men Continue Working.
There was only a short sitting of the Federal
Arbitration Court yesterday, the disputes coming
before Judge Edmunds being merely two in number.
There was a claim by Waterside Workers for £562
10s. 2d. on account of waiting time, and by the
Railway and Tramway Union for 3s. 4d. overtime
worked by a porter at the Central Station. The
steamship-owners denied that there was anything
due for waiting time. The Railway Commissioners
filed affidavits declaring that on the day the porter
on whose behalf the claim for overtime was made
was stated to have earned 3s. 4d. he was not in
the service of the department for two reasons: (1)
That he resigned seven years previously and (2)
had since died. After hearing counsel his Honor
said it was clear that if he went into details the
cases would drag on for the whole day. He there-
fore handed £562 10s. 2d. to the secretary of the
atersiders’ Union, who promised that work would
be resumed in the afternoon, and gave an order for
payment of 3s. 4d. to the porter on proof of identi-
fication. The representative of the railway men said
there would be no interruption of traffic, though
search parties would set out in pursuit of the porter
at once.
His Honor then proceeded to the Treasury, where
he secured an advance of £4962 4s. Bd., and caught
the train for Coonamble, where dislocation of the
rabbit industry is threatened in consequence of the
landowners claiming refunds on account of advances
against rabbits which have allegedly not been caught.
Prompt action by the Court is expected to avert
disaster.
Having thus supplied Judge Edmunds with
money to draw on, all that remains will be to
Provide him with a permanent staff of 50,000
assistants to get busy in any industry where
temporary objections are made to a cash
settlement.
The Innards of the Business.
Babylon and Carthage; the deportation of
Belgians to toil in Germany; the butcheries
in Poland and Armenia—what is the ex-
planation of these horrors? Just one thing
—War. Whenever war has been carried
on long enough, something like these abomi-
nations has always happened. For war is
just a large ravening monster, without re-
deeming feature, and nations that make war
create Hell. The idea that war can be
carried on by rules and regulations framed
in a spirit of brotherly affection is as futile
as the hope that what is called civilisation
can rob the horror of its unlovely features.
War means the spattering of blood and
brains and filling the land with woe and
misery; and the more copious the blood, the
more acute the agony, the greater and more
impressive the victory. It is to slay and
ruin that armies are launched against other
armies, and as there is hardly anything an
invading army will not do to spread the
tide of woe, so there is very little a defend-
ing army will omit from its programme. In
this case the German sees that he must
either defend himself or perish; and if to
save himself he has to enslave a conquered
people, that circumstance is not going to
weigh very heavy in the balance. As no
wars that the world has known have been
waged with greater ferocity than those con-
ducted in the name of the Lord, no one can
reasonably feel surprised at a conflict pro-
moted in the name of Kultur being accom-
panied by atrocity. The notion that there
is something picturesque and noble about the
horror is one of the delusions on the subject
which only affect men who have never seen
it. To individuals it gives scope for the
exercise of humanity and decency, fbr
chivalry and heroism in high form. But in
war as an institution these things have no
place. There is no pity there. War has no
soul, and it never had, spite of all the
Devil’s attempts to give it one. Yet there
are neople in Australia who are prepared
to risk letting the brute come and make a
meal off them.

The State Pay Roll.
There was a wild yell in the N. S. Wales
Assembly the other day because half a dozen
of the higher officers in the Railway Depart-
ment were down for ipcreases of salary
ranging from fl to £2 weekly. The reason
advanced to justify _ the noise was that it
was inequitable to give these increases while
leaving the “rank-and-file” with what it
had before. There was also a howl against
giving the Commissioner for Taxation £BOO
instead of £7OO a year, the ground for objec-
tion to this being that the night-watchman
only got £2 ,10s. a week. The Bulletin
believes it to be true that N. S. Wales has
on its pay roll a great number of suckers,
and that the rank-and-file of taxpayers, as
well as the men in the Public Service who
earn their pay, would gain considerably if
these individuals could be induced to take
to poultry-farming or mussel-gathering. But
the idea that because a man of special abili-
ties, performing duties of great responsibility
to the State, should not get another £1 a
week because 1756 other individuals cannot
or are not given some more, is silly. One
great difficulty confronting every undertak-
ing, private or public, is to discover the
man worth £lOOO a year, and it is a solemn
fact that, as a rule, when the State gets
such a man it makes less use of him than
it should. Hence the frequency of the £5
a week man in the £2O a week job. Natu-
rally enough it pays the politician to yelp
about the rank-and-file when the other man’s
pay happens to be mentioned. And that is
one very good reason why the less the poli-
tician has to do with these salaries the
better. His inclination will always be to
truckle to the crowd by paying as‘ little as
possible for brains; yet the more of those
things it has in its service and the more wisely
it uses them the better for the State. The
under-dog gets less than a fair deal, as a
rule, but the chances of the under-dog in
any business are not improved by driving
away its brains to the service ol a com-
Detitor.
Damaged Goods and their Repair.
“T. Pall” offers comfort and advice:—
That mournful poet “N.C.” (B. 30/11/T6), who
dates from a V.D. Compound his description of
himself as “dishonored, profligate and vile,” and
so on, should really cheer up a little. He is not
all he says of himself— not nearly all. He is, in
fact, a success, an illustration of the better days
to come, a man who has about a hundred chances
or getting completely rid of his infection compared
with the less than one which he would have had
if there were no V.D. Compounds or if he had
contracted his complaint as a civilian. Even if
stern sentries stand alway” it is a decided advan-
tage to the community at the present stage of
things, since it means that some woman will be
saved risk of infection and that the mournful war-
rior will be returned fit for active service at an
earlier date.
As a poem for earnest quotation from Wowser
pulpits “N.C.’s” is excellent, but as an example of
a reasonable outlook on things it is worth much
less than a small bunch of inferior dogs’-meat.
If “N.C.” continues to feel that way after his
approaching cure—and it may be said here that
the average for gonorrhea at V.D. Compounds is
about six weeks and for syphilis a little longer,
until men are fit for military duty and non-infectious
—he can do useful work amongst the ignorant and
inexperienced. On his return to civil life also he
can persistently howl into the large ear of the
nearest politician and twist that organ until the
owner really takes notice. He needn’t emit self-
deprecatory sounds in verse during this operation,
but may confine himself to, say, three major premises.
If telling the politician does not produce the desired
result he might tattoo the remarks with a blunt knife
and saltpetre on the subject’s back in order to be
certain of securing attention. They are these:—
(1) The control of venereal disease is a public
health matter, not a political one, nor a moral-
endeavor one, nor a newspaper one, nor a vested
interest one, nor a party one, nor a self-advertising
one.
(2) Public Health, in this sense, is operated by
Government Health Departments, not by any doctor
who has a practising qualification. Government Health
Departments need legal power to run things. They
also need funds. They are the best judges of what
powers and what funds are required. Politicians,
moral endeavorers, newspapers, vested interests and
party Lazaruses are not qualified to judge.
(3) Government Departments are liable to be
interfered with when they administer seriously any
legislation for the public benefit. The parties who
interfere are, mostly, politicians, moral endeavorers,
newspapers, vested interests and party Lazaruses-
All fools interfere, too, whenever they think of . it.
The bigger the scope of the Government the less risk
is there of interference producing any real or lasting
effect.
Naturally “N.C.” will choose a stout politician
if he is obliged to tattoo all that, but the portrait
of Premier Ryan, which appears under his printed
wail, will cheer him up greatly as indicating avail-
able space. “N.C.” might, in fact, add a few terse
remarks to the effect that about one Australian in
20 is suffering from venereal disease or its imme-
diate effects, that it is the biggest single factor
affecting national physical welfare, and that the
only real problem requiring solution is to get cases
under treatment as early as possible in order to
limit the chances of infection. There will be no
need to add any verses —except perhaps the line
“In honor’s cause to freely give my all” as a sort
of reminder of the importance of the matter.
If “N.C.” can multiply himself by a hundred
thousand or so in his propaganda work, this par-
ticular imported curse can be brought under effective
control in a twelvemonth. Public health is pur-
chasable, and it is a mere matter of putting up
the necessary powers and money. Personally I do
not see any reason why six States should proceed
to devise six sets of powers and order six Treasurers
to provide six bags of cash for six Health Depart-
ments. Venereal disease is a national matter. Also
it is largely a military development. The first
serious outbreak amongst the general population of
Australia dates from the return of troops after the
Boer war, and the present turmoil is merely spread-
ing it some more. The Federal Committee which
recently reported on venereal diseases has pointed
the way very clearly, and the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has put up £15,000 on a basis of subsidy
to State effort. Most of the States are still wrangling
as to whether they will accept it or not.
Meanwhile venereal diseases do business as usual.
What’s the matter with one Health Service for
Australia ?
Foe over 12 months there has been serious
trouble in Egypt because Billjim has been
compelled to ride in insanitary third-class
railway carriages; and the hopeless Pearce,
who ought to have got on to the matter at
once, still admits that he doesn’t know what
the facts are. In reply to Keating, in the
Senate the other day, he said that “on all
trains, where needed, he* was informed there
was a third-class coach to carry 78 military
passengers. On other trains parties of seven
or more soldiers might travel second-class.”
Senator Peaece added that, “as this evidently
referred to soldiers while on military duty,
a request had been forwarded for definite
information as to other occasions.” The
Minister, who, as the protector of the rights
of the Australian soldiers, ought to be the
first to get to know of insults and unneces-
sary hardships, seems to be the last man
in Australia to learn anything about them.
That the grievance was still keenly felt
recently this latest complaint on the subject
shows: —•
Even despatch riders doing their daily journey of
anything from 70 to 200 miles have to ride 3rd class.
For a while corporals were allowed to ride 2nd
class, so each of our despatch carriers was made a
corporal by wearing the stripes, which he handed
in when he came back. More than once they had
trouble with the Military Police for this, and at
last orders came that corporals were not to ride
2nd class. We tried hard to get despatch riders
made an exception, but it did not come off.
But the most monstrous thing of all was
the refusal to Billjim of the right to enter
anything but a third- or nigger-class carriage
while on leave. As he has quite rightly put
it in scores of letters from Egypt, had he
been a cold-footer who stayed at home he
would have been good enough not only to
ride first-class but to hire a special train if
he wanted one and was prepared to pay.
But in Egypt, because he had put on khaki,
he is denied the right to buy anything but
a third-class ticket; and though that shame-
ful wrong is nearly two years old, Pearce,
Minister for Defence, is still asking for
information about it! How can we expect
recruiting to be a success when the Depart-
ment is administered in this way?
A foreign brand on the article still im-
presses the Australian. London Opinion
lately paid The Bwlletin the doubtful
compliment of collaring without acknow-
ledgment its story of waste in fitting out
transports; and Australian papers promptly
reprinted the stolen paragraph under the
heading, among others; “Serious Charges
Made in England.” Jensen, Minister for
the Navy, professed to reply to it last week,
and of course didn’t. He merely alleged
that the fittings taken out of ships would
he replaced after the war. This did not
touch the point at all. The charge was
this: that owing to the lack of co-ordina-
tion between British and Australian Naval
Departments, troopships were pulled to
pieces at both ends of the voyage. Here
is a specific case for Jensen to go upon. A
vessel which brought Tommies south was
fitted with accommodation for officers on
the upper deck. Coming on to Australia
that accommodation was torn out and a
hospital was installed in its place. The
vessel took Billjims north, and was then
fitted out again for Tommies, the hospital
being torn out and the officers’ accommoda-
tion reinstated. When The Bulletin
dealt with the matter the officers’ accom-
modation was being torn out once more, and
a hospital again substituted. That kind of
criminal waste has been going on for a couple
of years; but until two or three months
ago, under the wickedest censorship that
was ever exercised in democracy, the
public, which pays, was not allowed to know
anything about it. Jensen, discussing
quite a different matter, is reported to have
said that the fittings taken out of troopships
will be replaced after the war. Where are
those fittings? As, apparently, Jensen,
Naval Minister, doesn’t know, The
Bulletin will tell hinf. They have gone up
in smoke. Tens of thousands of pounds of
carved fittings have been thrown on the
rubbish-heap and burned. Somebody ought
to go to gaol over it.

The atrocity of pushing Minister for Works
Gann.into the well-gilt job of Deputy Chief
Commissioner of N. S. Wales Railways is
practically complete. This flagrant act of
jobbery is being perpetrated by a Govern-
ment which has the audacity to call itself
“National,” and without a word of protest
from the public. The incident is an ugly
reminder of the demoralisation of political
parties and of the electors. For the
appointment there ,is not a word of justifica-
tion to be found. A few years ago Cann
himself would have virtuously denounced
any such transaction. To-day he grabs the
chance to accept public pay and do a gross
wrong to every railway man in the Com-
monwealth. There is also a suspicion that
more transactions of the same sort are being
hatched by this Ministry, which appears to
have set up in business as an incubator of
jobs. Two assistant forestry commission-
ers have to be appointed, each at £IOOO a
year. But it is explained that persons with
the necessary qualifications are not avail-
able, so a couple of Ministers are filling the
breach on an honorary basis, while two dis-
tinctly mediocre politicians, one of whom
knows his seat to be a goner, are licking
their lips with anticipatory pleasure of an
early meal.
The Post Office, anxious to find some scape-
goat to carry away its manifold sins into
the wilderness, has jumped on the licensed
seller of stamps. The 2| per cent, commis-
sion hitherto paid is to be reduced to 1 per-
cent., and the dealer in the small stickers is
to consider, himself lucky he is left on the
earth at all. As a matter of fact, the sta-
tioner or newsagent who sells stamps is
about the only bright spot in the Post Office
system. By buying it at a shop instead of
waiting to be served at the official counter
the busy man really can get a penny stamp
to put on a letter without the loss of half
a crown’s worth of time. The small profit
which the seller has made is a perfectly fair
thing when the nublic convenience is con-
sidered. If the Commonwealth can’t afford
to carry a letter for a penny, let the rate be
raised; but to attempt to cut out the shop-
keeper who enables us to post our letters,
merely because his efficiency is in such
marked contrast to the inefficiency of the
Post Office, is too bad.

The lodge-doctor is once more making an
angry noise in Victoria. A great many
lodge-patients, probably a majority of them,
belong to trades in which the wage-rates
have been considerably raised of late years.
But the lodge-doctor’s wages haven’t gone
up, though the cost of his victuals and
instruments has. There is a very evident
injustice in the situation—the doctor com-
pelled to eat cold corned beef while his
patients allow themselves stuffed pork, rely-
ing on lodge treatment in case they over-
eat themselves. Of course, most of the
doctors simply hate the idea of having to
rely upon unionism to get a fair thing. But
why ?. All civilisation is dependence upon
unionism. It is. only the savage who trusts
to himself and his own strength and cunning.
“Nefas” : “Empty transport sunk!” This
announcement is intended to relieve the
minds of the public. But what of the poor
devils who comprise the crew, whose depen-
dants enjoy no pension rights, either naval
or military? The men on transport duty
placed their nautical knowledge at the dis-
posal of the Government at the Govern-
ment’s own urgent request. Yet in so doing
they penalised both themselves and their
dependants. Both the military and naval
authorities disclaim responsibility. Surely
the country should shoulder the burden—
surely it should be above fobbing off the
families of the men engaged in this vital
service? No torpedoed transport is ever
literally “empty,” and while the present in-
justice lasts the women of those at sea must
have many black hours.
Peering around in search of some noiseless
little reform, the Peacock Government has
discovered the veterinary school at the Mel-
bourne Uni.., and by stopping the annual
grant of £2OO it is proposed to effect a
saving of this sum to the State. Hundreds
of thousands of other expenditure could be
better spared. There were 34 veterinary
students when the war began, and there are
27 now. Of 46 veterinary officers with the
A.I.F. at the Front, 26 are graduates of the
school, while a dozen others have jobs in
the Australian and British forces. The
Government also admits that it can place
more graduates than the school produces

mostly cows and horses, average about three
daily and come in from all over the State
for free treatment —over 1000 cases this
year, so far. Then there is a great deal
of research work done, and a vast deal more
to do —work relating to pleuro-pneumonia,
beef nodules, braxy and contagious abortion.
The losses from this last horror reach
£IOO,OOO yearly in Victoria alone. Considering
the record of Science in regard to fluke,
millions having been saved to the coun-
try by the stamping out of the disease, inter-
ference with the researches in hand would
be a cussed proceeding. Further, there is
the preparation of meningitis serum. The
imported article, when available, costs any-
thing over 10s. a dose. Already more than
11.000 doses have been prepared by the
Melbourne school and supplied free to the
health authorities; and there are as many
more to be supplied by next September.
As the sum already saved to Australia in
this one item definitely exceeds £SOOO, where
does Peacock’s reform come in?

The curse of “Pat O’Maori” :
The Irish Times, a Tory organ published in Dublin,
attempts to pour ridicule on the idea of subscriptions
being raised in Australia to relieve distress in Ire-
land. According to that journal, Ireland has known
no distress for 20 years, but is a land flowing with
milk and honey which rears up out of sheer natural
cussedness and misrepresents itself to the world for
political purposes. Unfortunately for the Irish
Times the statistics of pauperism are available to
alf men; and when the pride of the people and
their detestation of the workhouse are taken into
account, the fact that about 100,000 men and
women receive indoor or outdoor relief under the
Poor Laws, the statement that there is no distress
not merely stamps the Dublin newspaper as un-
truthful, but makes it clear that it is the organ
of a callous party indifferent to a people’s sufferings.
Beyond all doubt, the system of peasant proprietor-
ship by which the land is coming into the direct
possession of the people has done a lot to improve
things of late years; but the decreasing population,
owing to the drain through emigration, tells its own
tale. These things are comparative. By contrast
with the conditions of former years, when the
whole island starved that its alleged owners might
live in plenty, things are now good; but by contrast
with the conditions under which Australian sub-
scribers to the distress fund live, they are
bad and in some places damnable. Still the smug
Tory organ in Dublin publishes its yarn and the
Yellow Pup points to it and yelps applause, forget-
ting that its own big brother in Ulster has only half
a bone to gnaw, despite the anti-Irish wagging of its
unpatriotic tail. It’s a silly thing to publish a lie
that is so easily bowled out, but the pup doesn’t
worry about little things like that.
Senator Pearce took the limelight the other
day to observe that the Australian people
should “rub the scales out of their eyes” and
look squarely at the truth about the war.
They should, indeed. They should realise,
first of all, that for over two years they have
had the wool pulled into their eyes, and that
the man who was mainly responsible for
doing it was Pearce, Minister for Defence.
Now, when his policy has led us to the very
edge of a precipice, with sublime impudence
he bids us take the scales from our eyes. But
he need not have worried to give the advice.
The happenings of the past week or two have
brushed from the minds of even the most
frivolous and blatant the last remaining
excuse for misunderstanding what this
ghastly struggle means —and yet may mean.
It is not for nothing that the British Par-
liament is assenting to something like a revo-
lution in the political and administrative
functions of the Cabinet, while the French
Ministry overhauls itself and the higher mili-
tary command. The truth is that the con-
quest of Boumania, the chaos in Greece and
the torpedo of the submarine have made it
clear to the Allies that ideas about defeat-
ing the German with anything short of
the last ounce is just lunacy. Another
thing plain enough is that, even with
the last ounce employed, the job will
be long and desperate. The best that
can be said now is that at last the fatuous
talk about the early winning of the war has
ended, and that the period of getting down
to bedrock and making the fight the one and
only consideration has commenced. To the
people of Australia tlie meaning of this is
that, whether they like it or not. they will
have to realise two things. One is that then-
country is in deadlv peril: the other that
the army, which stands between them and
that peril, is wasting under the enemy’s fire.

Henry Fletcher finds difficulties: —
Randolph Bedford’s apology for wine ignores
items important to consider if we wish to promote
wine-drinking. In wine-drinking countries wine is
drunk almost exclusively at meals, as we drink tea —
at least, by the fairly well-to-do. The drink between or
after meals in Paris is beer. Table wine is dry;
the taste for it has to be acquired; and it costs
under the most favorable conditions much more than
tea. In past years several restaurants in Sydney
have offered their customers, without extra charge,
the choice of wine or tea, and not only was the wine
of good quality not rushed, but over a series of
years the demand actually declined. So far as Aus-
tralian wine has made progress in public bars, it has
done so by satisfying with strong vintages the craving
of spirit-drinkers for alcohol. Hence our wine-shops
are often greater centres of drunkenness than hotels.
As an old wine-drinker, let me give the Sydney
cost prices (pre-war): Hunter River claret, new,
Is. 9d. a gallon; same wine stored and cellared for
two or three years, and fit to drink, 4s. a gallon. A
moderate consumption of dry wine at a meal is half
a pint per head. On your fingers count up the cost
for a family, and see the great difficulty. Nor, owing
to its bulky nature, the cost of casks, cellaring and
skilled attention, is it possible to greatly reduce the
above figures by buying crude new wine and letting
it mature. In Prance the cost of the family wine
often equals that of the family food.
I have French friends in Sydney, and I find that,
after they have struggled a few years to keep up
the wine habit, the teapot gains the victory.- Tea by
its cheapness and ease of preparation, and the con-
cealing of its ill-effects to all eyes but those of
experts, has everywhere an advantage. To expect
Australians to abandon a cheap habit they like and
adopt an expensive habit they don’t like, is pure
fantasy. Even coffee, a superior drink of its nature,
cannot battle, because of its cost and greater
trouble to prepare, against the Chow drug. In
U.S.A., South Africa and even France it is fighting
for its life against tea. Against this monopoly by the
liver- and kidney-destroying herb I suggest without
enthusiasm a free granting of table-wine licenses to
public dining-rooms and the enlightenment of the
public by medical men and the press of the dietic
and physical action of our leading drinks.

“C.”: Here is something for inquiry.
Away out from Pine Creek a while ago two
abos. were arrested. On the way in to the
police-station one of the witnesses, a gin,
produced another little nigger during the
night. Next day it is alleged that the party,
including the gin, was pushed along some-
where about 20 miles. The party was in
charge of a police constable, a protector of
abos. I and other bushmen of these parts
want to know whether the constable doesn’t
think a gin could easily have done 25 miles
the day after the domestic event.
The big job of settling the reduction of
hotel rents consequent on 6 o’clock closing is
about to be tackled in S. Aus. President
Brown, who has now withdrawn his resig-
nation from the Industrial Court, could not
find t}ie time to handle this item, and as a
new Act of last session allows some of his
work to be taken over by an S.M., R. G.
Nesbit gets the delicate job.
“1.W.W.”: As an anti-conscriptionist, I
demand a referendum on the Conscription of
Wealth. The taxation foreshadowed in the
Treasurer’s financial statement is conscrip-
tion of wealth, and on principle I protest
against it, especially as the greater portion
of it is being spent abroad, not at home. I
admit I am not personally interested in the
matter, inasmuch as I possess no wealth;
but neither was I personally concerned m
the recent attempted conscription of life, yet
I made a loud noise of protest against that,
and am anxious to do likewise as regards
Wealth. Perhaps Mr. Hughes will make an
announcement on the subject.
The Labor split in S. Aus. is going to have
serious results at the next Parliamentary
elections, if a line can be taken from the
just-over municipal contests, which were run
mostly on party lines. In Adelaide, Gunn,
M.L.A.. was turned out of the City Coun-
cil ; Lundie, prominent in Labor circles, was
badly beaten for alderman, and Norwood
turned down Lionel Hill, M.L.A., president
of the Antis, for a comparatively unknown
lawyer. Even the manufacturing districts of
Hindmarsh and Thebarton went Liberal.
Party politics are stranger than fiction.
Last December the Liberal crowd fought
Labor to keep the astute Richard Denis
Meagher out of Sydney’s mayoral chair.
This December Labor just as fiercely fought
the Liberal to achieve the same object.
Meagher won on both occasions. He gener-
ally does when the bone’s got some fat on it.

Here’s another chance for the Federal
Government to distinguish itself. Peacock
wants it to buy the training-ship John
Murray, whereon to teach Australia’s bud-
ding Nelsons to clap a telescope to a blind
eve. When N. S. Wales wanted to get rid
of the old Sobraon it persuaded the Com-
monwealth to take her over at a high figure
as a training-ship. So why not the John
Murray, which must be nearly as old and
out of date?

“A Waltz Dream” is finishing a revival at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and it is just as well
it isn’t scheduled for a long run. Some or
the principals can’t face the music at all, and
the audience is never quite at ease until the
chorus and orchestra take charge. The last
production of the season, it is a faint and
faded show in more senses than one, and the
two “creations” worn by Marie Eaton and
Ethel Morrison in the second act are like
cool drinks in the desert to the people who
come to see animated fashion-plates. Fred
Maguire (Lieut. Nicholas) has to beat the
air with his hands when he is after top-notes,
and William Green (Lieut. Monte) can’t
help him out. Dorothy Brunton does her
best with the female mock heroics of

romps through the light and cheerful job of

“Hindle Wakes,” staged for the first time
in Melbourne at the King’s on Saturday,
vigorously discusses the case of Fanny Haw-
thorn. who refuses to be punished by marry-
ing the man. Her announcement to this
effect is the sensation of the play, and natu-
rally makes the most painful impression on
the council of parents who are arranging o
save her reputation. Her mamma is almost
stunned by Fanny’s failure to realise that
young Jeffcote is an eligible parti with pro-
spective monev to burn. Her papa and Jett-
cote’s rigid parent are more astounded by her
moral inlirmitv in regarding her week-end as
a “bit of a lark.” As for her partner in
naughtiness, he is strangely jarred by the
knowledge that she has a conception of the
philandering spirit which he had thought the
monopoly of the male. In the crisis of his
discovery he calls the damsel immoral,
though in a cooler moment he almost con-
siders her immortal. And Fanny, who
declines his hand in wedlock despite the
temptation of his cash and the terrible influ-
ence; of the social code, seems almost deserv-
ing of immortality. Sim is a rare good
character in a play which all round is
entitled to marked respect. “Hindle Wakes
is a striking achievement, and demonstrates
that original drama can be evolved out of the
most hackneyed sex themes by ignoring the
demands of romantic convention.

TIVOLI.
Sydney James and Billy.
“Hindle Wakes” contains eight main
characters, and five of them are reasonably,
well acted. Pearl Hellmrich’s matter-of-
factness makes Fanny the obstinate, unimagi-
native wench against whom all remon-
strances and arguments are doomed to fail.
Her attitude when she turns down the prof-
fered “reparation” of Alan Jeffcote discloses
that she is a young woman of ingrained
frivolity without much sense of moral obliga-
tion. lan Maclaren is possibly up to specifi-
cations as old Nathaniel Jeft'cote. He has a
tongue for home-truths and an eye for battle,
and snorts his Purityranny like an old-tune
Wesleyan local preacher. Gerald Kay
Souper, as Christopher Hawthorn, suggests
a milder Baptist training, and his manner is
indicative of evasion and compromise. On
the other hand, his missus (Nan Taylor) is
a raspy and unpleasantly sour old female
who exuues enough vinegar to pickle the com-
pany. Piumpton Wilson, as Alan, never
looks equal to the irregular connubiality of
the week-end with Fanny. His escapade, of
course, provokes rather obvious comparisons
from his goody-goody fiancee (Esther Mit-
chell). but she puts no force into her impli-
cation that he is in the position of a man
who has spoilt his palate for chicken by
coarse indulgence in corned beef and carrots.
Gladys Leigh is satisfactory as Mrs. Jettcote,
and the ruddv make-up of Thomas Tilton
as Sir Timothy Farrar provides the only
garish note in the sombre surroundings.
Next Saturday the Kate Howard co. opens
in “The White Slave Traffic,” described as
a “play of Australian city life.”

Some art visitors to Melbourne :
Nine well-known talents are represented in the
latest fine show at Melbourne Centreway. Heading
the programme is a set of Hilder water-colors which
would resemble Chopin nocturnes if they were trans-
lated into musical terms. An attractive feature of
the efforts is their delicate suggestion of mystery
and mind. Hans Heysen has 11 radiant tributes
to the beauty of our gum-tree scenery. The dis-
tinctive Heysenish glow is charming, and the wonder-
ful color holds the eye. Harold Herbert, the bril-
liant Victorian water-colorist, carves up a section
of bush into a series of sun-soaked decorations. Com-
pared with Herbert’s bracket the landscape of
McNally, another Victorian, would be productive of
cold shivers and bronchitis. Yet his somewhat cheer-
less sketches are full of cleverly-realised atmospheric
effects. Eight nude visions in water-color and five
assorted black-and-whites bear the signature of
Norman Lindsay. The artist overcomes many tech-
nical difficulties in his colored impressions of endear-
ing young arms and all the rest of the feminine out-
fit Three of the five examples in pen and ink are
admirable studies of character and costume. Of the

reminds one of a toy-shop at Christmas time. Her
drawings are interesting in their way, but they seem
childish and innocuous beside the masculine land-
scape work, not to mention N. Lindsay’s pagan
divinities.

“Florodora” was revived for a few nights
at Melbourne Majesty’s on Saturday. Phil
Smith is thrust into the varied garments of
Tweedlepunch, with the result that Tweedle-
punch becomes merely an alias for Smith.
Leslie Holland, as Cyrus Gilfain, embezzles
the famous perfume secret from Ethel Cad-
man’s father, but Holland’s personality isn’t
sumptuous enough to fill the part. ' Ethel
Cadman sings sweetly as Dolores, without
making the role anything more than a bit of
living statuary. The clothes of Frank
Abercoed are lined with good round Ralston,
and John’s noble baritone gets a great chance
in the long-remembered “Shade of the
Palms.” Reg Roberts (Captain Donegal)
and Minnie Love (Angela Gilfain) pair
nicely whenever they can get a clear stage,
and Elorence Young, cast as Lady Holy-
rood, seems a necessity to every comedy situ-
ation. Clyde Cook has the job of the Rolling
Stone, and Percy Clifton glowers at regular
intervals as Leandro. The chorus is more
imposing than usual, and Maggie Dickinson
is a glad patch of colored raiment in a dance
solo in the last act. “Florodora” is expected
to last until Monday night. From then till
the following Saturday the theatre will pre-
sumably be closed to allow of final prepara-
tions for “The House that .Tack Built.”

“School for Scandal,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, continues to be a graceful, decorative
performance that maintains the light spirit
of the period in which it was written. Only
in the drinking party scene is there any
noticeable heaviness of treatment. Vivian
Edwards, as the roystering Charles, still
fails to comport himself like a person of
quality. Also, his pal Careless (Fred
Kehoe) seems like a boisterous juvenile who
wants to turn his part of the “School” into
a kindergarten. Otherwise there are many
things in the show to be grateful for, though
the attitude of the audience is not one of
them. Wilkie’s followers hardly warm to
Sheridan as they do to Shakspeare. The
Irishman’s comedy never gets them tickled.

The energy of Dr. Scanlan as a lecturer
on syphilis continues unabated at Melbourne
Royal. The expert pours out the vials of
his eloquence for the better part of three
acts, eventually leaving young Dupont and
his mother bitterly stricken by the science
that he brings into play. It is a terrible
load of talk to unloose on two unfortunate
human beings, and it seems the colder and
more wearisome because it lacks the gaieties
and mental flashes that make Shaw’s intel-
lectual bullying tolerable. “Damaged Goods”
would be no less indicative of an earnest
purpose if its philosophy contained a few
smiles and its dialogue were tipped with
epigram. But Brieux is too solemn a re-
former to attempt the graces of the literary
craftsman. He prefers his sermons to have
the road-making value of blue-metal rather
than the engaging glitter of diamonds.
Excitement prevails at Hoyt’s two Mel-
bourne theatres this week. Olga Petrova, as
a disguised princess in “The Eternal Ques-
tion,” is palpitating in the arms of bad, bad
men and providing the thrilling details in a
great aeroplane rescue at sea. Also, Theda
Bara, cast as lead in “The Galley Slave,” is
suffering amazing vicissitudes as a deserted
wife with a buxom infant hanging on to her
skirts. Hoyt’s supporters cannot ask for
much more than Olga and Theda on the one
bill. Three hours of heaving bosom and re-
splendent emotion are guaranteed when these
two share the screen.

The son (Plumpton

can’t marry the girl.
Brock’s Dandies at St. Kilda (Vic.) are
still devoting half their evenings to an
alleged musical revue called “The Seaside
Hotel.” They have changed the first part of
the programme, however, without radically
altering the drawing-roomy character of
their offerings. The hit of this section on
Saturday was a humorous duet by Brennan
and de Robeek, from which they emerged
with somewhat hoarse voices and dis-
arranged features. Also Lalla Ward
warbled tunefully of “Love’s Star,” and
Pearlie McKenzie told all that she knew of
“Dollie.” The information wasn’t of much
account, but it was passed on piquantly in
the tones of a Pearlie spoilt by a doting
mother.
To Adelaide Majestic, King and Virginia
Thornton have brought their tabloid dramas,
if Burroughs and Wellcome will let us say
so. Kee and Lee and the Cavanas look after
the athletic side: so do the Arteens, but
their dog gets most of the applause. The
old thriller, “Her Second Time on Earth,”
is at the Tivoli, with Agnes Keogh as the
lady who collects husbands, and Roy Red-
grave very clever as the Italian. Kelway
and Maud Goldspink supply the humorous
touch. The Royal pictures a Gaboriau story,
and West’s a powerful R. W. Chambers; but
Wondergraph starts a fresh “Crimson
Stain.” (Children free!) Winsloe Hall’s
splendid Adelaide Orchestra has finished its
season with a Town Hall concert, featuring
a new young soprano, Rita Coonan ; and the
open-air Dandies are thankful most evenings
that their new Austral Gardens outfit in-
cludes a canvas covering.
The self-reliant Victorian farmer lately
besought Works Minister Adamson to sool
the tiger Sosh on to give him another bite.
The State has for some years been supply-
ing Hayseed with wire-netting on easy terms
at cost price; now Hayseed wanted it
applied to barb-wire, so that he might keep
elephants, I-Won’t-Workers and similar
nuisances off his wheat, poddy calves and
other vegetables. Adamson asked Hayseed
if he wouldn’t like the State to supply
Socialistic posts as well, so that the sturdy
husbandman might have something really
reliable to lean against. It was just there
the thermometer dropped swiftly.
Gilruth’s lease of his big job in the North-
ern Territory falls in pretty soon and Prime
Minister Hughes admits that his shaky
Cabinet is “considering the question of re-
appointment.” Under its present chief, the
Northern Territory (523,620 sq. miles) has
produced little besides Government officials
—and they grow well enough in the
South. If the Commonwealth could afford
to let the Territory doze while the world
was sowing the wind, it can’t afford to do
so now when the red whirlwind is being har-
vested. Whoever takes charge next term
must put ginger into the administration.
It’s a big man’s job at any.time and a very
big man’s job when the world is being made
over again. Has Australia got an undis-
covered Cromer about it?
AT POVERTY POINT
Stargazer”: Brieux’s “Damaged Goods,”
the only attempt within my recollection to
make use of the stage, deliberately and
directly, as a great public utility at the
crisis of a valuable reform movement, “got
nothing” from the Melbourne morning
dailies. In each case the attitude of the
critic was just paltry. The Argus, true to
its traditions, dreaded some shocking effect
upon public morals from this honest and
clean but open-eyed scientific effort to give
public morality the biggest uplift it lias had
in a hundred years. Other critics, suddenly
superior, smote Brieux hip and thigh, as a
flushed matron swipes an offensive infant,
because his stage art is not precisely that
of Sardou or Pinero. “Damaged Goods” is
a dramatic sermon, the first interesting ser-
mon I have met in 50 years. It is doubly
valuable in showing how sermons may be
made effective and acceptable, and in rock-
ing right home a terrible moral. Brieux
deliberately sacrifices art—accepted drama-
tic art, that is—but he offers another art, a
new art, that of the practical sermon, and
we should be piously grateful to him for
giving us a serious, sane, scientific demon-
stration of very necessary facts, never with-
out force, and never wholly without drama-
tic appeal. If sometimes the dramatist’s
aims and ideas are too big for that miser-
ably circumscribed ring-fence which our
pettifogging critics label “Dramatic Art,” I
for one am happy to see the latter’s barbed
wire bombed to the Devil.
“S.S.” : There is underlying much of the
condemnatory criticism of “Damaged
Goods” in Melbourne an implied reproach
directed at the Firm for attempting to make
money out of the crusade against syphilis.
This is rotten logic, coming from men who
have continually reproached managements
for making money out of trivial ' rubbish.
Are we who make a great show of wanting
a more serious, more literary, more ambi-
tious theatre prepared to contend that it is
essential that managements shall not profit
by these productions? The sensible frame
of mind should move us to pray that entre-
preneurs may make good money out of good
plays. If J.C.W., Ltd.. comes out of this
venture right financially, it may presently
be induced to believe that there is a public
that wants honest theatrical fare for its
honest bawbees. I would as soon think of
railing at a fishmonger for selling fresh
fish, throwing at him the accusation that he
was slyly and hypocritically seeking to take
advantage of a genuine public objection to
the stale variety.
“H. 0.” : After the bouquets the Firm has
thrown at itself for its courage in staging
“Damaged Goods,” it is mildly amusing to
find that only a bowdlerised version of
Brieux’s play is being presented. For in-
stance, the doctor is telling George what
advice he should give a son to mitigate his
chance of contracting syphilis. George is to
tell the lad “to love only one woman”—a
piece of idealistic advice that was loudly
applauded at the special matinee given to
an audience of parsons and social workers.
Then follows this dialogue:—
George: That’s easy, isn’t it! And if my son
does not marry till he is 28, what then?
Doctor: Then, that he may run the least risk, you
will tell him to go to the licensed dealers—
George: With a guarantee from the Government.
In the Williamson version, this much more
practical advice, constituting an argument
for Government control of Flossie with a
view to making her as sanitary as possible,
is omitted. Perhaps if it had been left in
the play would not have received the blessing
of those Ministers who have neglected the
obvious duty of introducing C.D. Acts.
Frederick Ward, the actor who got into
N.S.W. Bankruptcy Court through the fail-
ure of “The Victory” at the Little Theatre,
Sydney, says the two fancy-goods religionists
for whom he staged the curious play were
distressed when they found that the
dramatic Good Work wasn’t a financial
winner. Asked if he did not discuss matters
with Sister Veni at the Home of Truth,
Ward answered sadly? “I tried to, but it
was always very difficult to discuss any-
thing with Sister Veni, as she talked all tin.
time.” And there Ward found the reason
why no great religious movement has ever
been led by a woman. The role of the
prophet is to look wise in three volumes
and sa .V about six words - a day—very com-
monplace words that might mean Anything.

its own dramatists, unless they can grin
through a horse-collar and caricature their
own mother who is Australian. There’s
only one place for the Australian play-
wright, and that’s about 6000 miles east
of Sydney Heads. But 50 or 60 years

tion; so who has a grudge against his

the figure at £25 and costs, which will make
a big hole in the lady’s next dividend from
that gold-mine in Yackandandah which her

PRACTICAL PRESCRIPTION
AGAINST STOMACH ACIDITY.
BY A SPECIALIST.
“Nine-tenths of all cases of stomach
trouble nowadays,” says a leading special-
ist, “are caused by too much acid. In the
beginning the stomach itself is not diseased,
but if this acid condition is allowed to con-
tinue, the acid is very likely to eat into the
stomach walls and produce stomach ulcer,
which may render a radical surgical opera-
tion necessary, even to prolong life. There-
fore an ‘acid stomach’ is really a dangerous
condition, and should be treated seriously.
It is utterly useless to take pepsin and ordi-
nary stomach tablets. The excess acid
must be neutralised by the administration
of an efficient antacid. For this purpose
physicians nearly always recommend taking
half a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia
in a little water after each meal. Large
quantities may be used, if necessary, as it
is absolutely harmless. But be sure to get
the bisurated magnesia, as other forms ot
magnesia have not the same action in the
stomach as the bisurated, and frequently
do more harm than good.”— Advt.

SOCIETY
THE FEMININE ATTITUDE.
“ANOTHER hat! Do you think I am made of
money?”
“Oh, no. But I want other women to think
you are.”
“T.C.”: I seriously maintain that the
intermingling of “Imperial” and “Colonial”
troops has had a beneficial effect on the
former —from the point of view of the
impertinent “cawloniaV’ of course. The
cow-like contentedness of the Tommy 'to
stand any blooming thing is now almost a
memory of the past. Queer and horrifying
adventures have befallen orderly-officers
when doing the rounds at tucker-time, per-
functorily inviting complaints. For lo!
they have been taken at their word—have
met Oliver Twists who have not only dared
to demand more, but have even cast asper-
sions on the quality of their food. And
delightfully outrageous stories of the doings
of Tommies when returning to their billets
or lines at night have become quite com-
mon. This applies especially to the “Scot-
ties” ; for Jock and Bilj. hit it remarkably
well together. Jock has a natural admira-
tion for Bilj.’s capacity for taking giv-
ing stoush; while Bilj. has an appreciative
eye for Jock’s rugged and hardy physique.
Also, not being an habitual teetotaller, he
has vast respect for Jock’s superior capa-
city to grapple with fiery spirits. Many a
time have sleepy sentries been made uneasy
by mysterious sounds approaching at an
uncannily slow pace along some shadowy
sap or roadway; and investigation has
merely revealed a couple of sober Jocks
escorting home one totally oblivious Anzac.
(But note this: When Bill has been wanted
—when it has come to business —he has
never been found missing.) It is on record,
too, that at a certain base, when our Bill-
jims, goaded by some particularly foolish
application of Imperial “regimentalism,”
began to caper joyously, the Jocks, instead
of gazing on in open-mouthed horror, cheer-
fully joined in. If Bruce Smith wants any
further evidence of the shocking democratic
deterioration of the British Army he can
find it in official records. Why, but yesterday
I heard an educated “gentleman-officer”
of the Flying Corps deliberately, voluntarily
and naturally pronounce Ypres “Wipers,”
just like a common bally Tommy. So
anything’s possible in these degenerate days.
No; don’t mistake me. Association with
Billjim hasn’t done it all, or anything like
all. When Britain adopted universal ser-
vice, conscription—call it what you like—
that moment the old order was dead.

“Harrison O.” : The abolition of barmaids
in Victoria —it will be a very gradual pro-
cess, as those already registered are not to
be interfered with and Hebe is a notoriously
long-lived girl—will be welcomed by many
who are not members of a Band of Hope.
Lovers of booze for its own sake have always
resented the presence of the calcium-powder
blonde. Also she has scared away many
nervous youths whose leanings are alcoholic
but not amorous. As a tribe, barmaids, in
the better-class taverns, at any rate, are
coldly-respectable, unexciting females, who
affect some culture though they have it not.
The voluptuous creature, full of unladylike
intentions, who figures in the dark suspi-
cions of the suburban housewife, is mostly
a myth, created by tame husbands suffering
from delusions anent their own devilishness.
Only the bald of many years’ standing and
the callow youth whose wild oats are just
sprouting on his upper lip are really inter-
ested in the vanishing lady. In Melbourne
the two hotels which do by far the largest
bar trade employ barmen only.

What a flood of smug nonsense “Damaged
Goods” has let loose! In Melbourne, Arch-
deacon Hindley, for instance, “welcomed
the play and the presentation of it as light
on dark places and things; as the breaking
of a conspiracy of silence on the social evil;
and as a means of educating the people on
the subject.” But who were the conspira-
tors? Archdeacon Hindley has a pulpit—has
had a pulpit for years and years. What use
did he make of it? Incidentally, since the
man is at the Front, The Bulletin sees no
reason why it shouldn’t say that John
Dailey is more largely responsible for break-
ing that “conspiracy” than any other person
in Australia. Seven years ago, when Dailey
first persuaded The Bulletin to deal with
syphilis as frankly as with any other disease,
the paper received scores of shocked letters,
though for a start the matter was handled
gingerly. To-day even the S. M. Herald
allows professors and parsons to talk freely
of syphilis, and some day the dear old lady
will" mention the horrible thing herself.

From a hospital ship after the Romani
desert battle: —
I got my handful of trouble carrying Major W
out when we were retiring after an attack pn a
ridge which we occupied but could not hold. He
was shot through the back. I dragged him behind
a mound, and two of my boys helped me to bandage
him; but you never realise how large a large man
is until you try to fix him up with a field dressing.
It was like trying to tie up St. Paul’s Cathedral
with a lady’s handkerchief. We were the only ones
left in the gully by this time, and they pelted us,
even honoring us with shrapnel. But their luck
was out. I got the patient fixed up somehow, and
proceeded to lug him over the rise about 50 yards
away.
I' had nearly got there when a locomotive seemed
to collide with the back of my hand, and I yelped
like a pup. I found cnat one and a half fingers were
left dangling, the bullet having gone through the
hand and ploughed up through the fingers, coming up
dead in the centre of a nail. That put me out of
the carrying competition, and my two boys continued
the procession. I lost sight of them as 1 edged away
to the left so as not to draw fire on them. I got
behind a mound about 2ft. high, which Abdul pre-
sently mistook for a machine-gun “possy.” There
actually was one of ours crackling away on the ridge
about 50 3'ards in front of me. Abdul therefore pro-
ceeded to pare that mound of mine away. The
bullets fairly tore over me, cutting the top clean off.
During the process I don’t suppose I was more than
three inches high, but I felt as big as a Dread-
nought. I made a break then, fleeing in a dust-
storm. I was the only visible target they had, and
they made the most of me. It’s queer, but I didn't
feel a bit scared then. As a matter of fact, I

stopped to pick up an open jack-knife I saw lying on
the sand.
Over the rise at last I stumbled on to a spare
horse, and no sooner had climbed into the saddle
than a bullet went through his stifle into his belly,
and I was on foot once more. I saw a double limber
pulling out, and one of the —th boys galloped after
it and waited for me. When I got there I found
Major W and my tw'o lads. A shrapnel had got
the three of them. The Major had by this time four
wounds, one of the boys had three and his mate two.
1 had received an additional flesh wound. We got
to the dressing-station, only to find it packed, and,
worse, under fire. One patient was actually killed
on the operating-table. Yet now, when I was com-
paratively safe, I was as scared as a man could be.
I expect my nerves were just about tangled by this
time—-the hand is a bad place for that —and 1 made
sure I was going to stop another. This beautiful
state of affairs lasted about an hour, then I got a
jerk of morphia, and feeling myself again, went out,
got my back against a bit of a tree, and tried to
snooze.

From an Australian base office in France:
Australian soldiers have learned with astonishment
that the authorities have prohibited the despatch of
“billies” this Christmas, and have advised the use of
stout cardboard boxes. Even tins are sometimes bat-
tered almost out of recognition. I have seen
hundreds of parcels which originally left Australia in
cardboard boxes arrive in Egypt and France a shape-
less mass, unrecognisable as to ownership, and con-
sequently never delivered. Personally it matters
little to me if they are packed in steel trunks or
brown paper. I long ago advised my people to dis-
continue sending, anything except a weekly paper.
The postal service is still disgraceful. Parcels
sent to me as far back as May last have not been
delivered, and this seems to be the luck of thousands
of others. Many families make home sacrifices in
order to send to brothers or fathers at the Front;
and that these parcels should b.e so lightly regarded
in the official mind is a scandal. My unit arrived
in France over five months ago, and up till last week
only five parcels had been delivered amongst us/ in
spite of the fact that one man alone had advice of
eight parcels despatched, and most of the others of
at least two each. We sent a “round robin” to the
D.A.P.S., London, fo which no reply was received.
After waiting another month we put in separate
complaints, through our 0.0. Yesterday we received
eight parcels (in various stages of demolition) dating
back to April. Mine were not amongst them.

Like a mad Christian I do thee forgive
Six o’clock closing ’neath the sober stars ;
But, ere I die, permit me once to live,
And leave to me my ladies of the bars.
Old, cruel men! to steal my only girls!
To take the only dozen that I love 1
Some with lank hair and some with nut-brown curls,
Some flame, and some as gentle as the dove.
Shall Flora go? Shall Agnes? And shall Maude?
Die thus to make a wowser’s holiday?
Not while the pen is shorter than the sword;
Not while the bar serves each man who can pay!
Yes. Maude must go 1 Maude who is dark and
plump—
And none to fill her shoes shall ever come!
In forty years, down by the village pump,
A poet-—of a kind —both blind and dumb,
Shall weep for her; and tell how wowsers slew
New little barmaids as they grew to nine;
How all barladies dwindled to a few,
And were as precious as a vintage wine.
Of barmaids there’ll be left no specimen
For the museum scientists’ research ;
And what the Devil will the world do then?
There is a thought to knock you off your perch—
A world without a specimen of Kate !
Of Kate or Muriel, Marian or Lil!
? h! much too far can go this killjoy hate—
A.nd Nemesis shall come to Wowserville.
And in those days the wealthy connoisseur
Shall' burn his Raphaels and Correggios ;
Collecting, in their stead, some mummy Her,
Who once was barmaid where the Yarra flows;
And turn her round to show the label there—
“ Maid of the Bar: circa, nineteen sixteen” ;
Careless of whether she was dark or fair —-
Only that she’s the first his guest has seen.
Wowsers, reflect! For in the days to be,
Fakers shall make false barmaids for the sales;
Wowsers, it is the height of infamy,
To think you’d help to forge such fairy tales.
’Ere ’tis too late, bethink thee 1 Do repeal
Laws that bring curses unto thine and mine.
Hast thou a heart to think, a head to feel?
Then leave the ladies to adorn the wine!

“F.N.T.”: Five Melbourne doctors, pecu-
liarly qualified for the job, have been
appointed by Health-Minister McLeod to
recommend a method of ensuring a pure-milk
supply for children. It is about time it was
done —not the formation of the committee,
which is a matter likely enough to lead no-
where, but the purifying of the milk supply,
The committee consists of Dr. Richard Bull,
director of bacteriology at the Melbourne Uni-
versity, and Dr. William Osborne, physiology
professor at the same shop, Dr. Jeffries
\Vood and Dr. Douglas Stephens, both with
long experience in treating sick children, and
Dr. Robert McAdam, an official of the
B.M.A. in Victoria. Now that the matter
is in these expert hands, no good excuse can
be offered for not carrying out whatever
recommendations may be made. But it is a
practical certainty that a bad excuse will
be found. The one that suggests itself at

this stage is national economy—and the
economy which continues to permit a high,
preventable death-rate among infants is the
same sort of filthy economy which leaves the
gutter unswept to save municipal money.
“Mujik”: Next time Stiggins is telling
yarns about the horrors of Derrink he might
as well ring in this one. He was an Aus-
tralian, and when the stretcher-bearers car-
ried him in and the surgeons tidied up the
damage he didn’t say “ ’Struth” or anything
like that. And when they got him to a hos-
pital and the nurse asked if he wanted any-
thing to eat he omitted to make any remark
about the menu. “H’m! Shell shock,” said
a surgeon, and specialists in nerve disorders
came and pawed him over and did no good.
He got up cured of his wounds, but still
dumb. So they shipped him back home with
a load of the darpaged. On the way out he wan-
dered ashore at Durban with a mate and got
soused. The pair of them went to sleep on
the beach, and when the alcohol in the beer
had been assimilated, Billjim sat up and re-
sumed the conversation interrupted by an
explosion in France.

“Timi Piripi”: Here are two contributions
to the next dictionary of Australian slang.
The late Emily Soldene told me that she
was the innocent cause of the Melbourne
policemen acquiring the soubriquet of “John
Dunn,” which dated from her performance
of Genevieve de Brabant. “John Dunns”
was the way Collin’wood understood the
title of the “Bold Gens d’Armes” duet.
“John Dunn” has been, of course, modern-
ised into “John.” “I’m going to empty
meself into this John,” I heard a pugnacious
Surrey Hillite yell one night, as he shaped
up to a constable. Here in Brisbane an
ancient corrected me when I invited him one
hot summer day to enjoy a “long sleever.”
“That’s not the proper word,” he said; “at
any rate, in Sydney 50 years ago it used
to be ‘lawn sleever’! There was a very tall
bishop there named Barker, and the
’forties used to call a long beer a ‘Bishop
Barker,’ and I think ‘lawn sleever’ was
another way of putting it!”
* * * *
“Dad”: A brother Billjim remarks (B.
10/8/T6) that no amount of training will
make us the equal of the Tommy in some
soldiering respects. As to this it is interest-
ing to note that, apart from the proved dash
of the “Colonial” and his “unconquerable
tendency to sport it,” he can hold his own
at the other part—the “showy” part—of the
business with the English troops. We’ve had
a spell of nearly four months in England,
and during that time our officers and
N.C.O.’s have been at-
tending different
schools of instruction
In nearly every case
our boys top the list.
And, mind you, the
examiners and instruc-
tors are English, with
a wonderful reverence
for the old order of
things. For instance,
a flickering eyelid on
parade is a sin whose
enormity is beyond
description. One of
these got a shock at
Chelsea the other day.
The new King’s Guard
were “mounting,” and
their departure was
glorified by the playing
of the march by the
Guards’ Band. Our
instructor-sergeant had
often told the squad
how to distinguish the
Coldstreams from the
Scottish and both from
the Irish Guards, etc.
Anxious to now parade
the knowledge of his
class before the ad-
jutant (a mighty man
is he), he roared out:
“That Orstralian sarn’t
there, what band is
that?” The Orstra-
lian sprang .to atten-
tion, and without a
moment’s hesitation
placed it: “Alexander’s
Ragtime Band, sir.”
Then another band
played. Still, that sort of thing doesn’t
rattle them now. Realising that we are
Australians they are beginning to expect us
to be “different,” and judge us accordingly.

The State works in a mysterious way its
blunders to perform. The Vic. Board of
Health has the right to condemn any build-
ing that doesn’t suit its ideas of sanitation;
and fairly easy ideas those are. No doubt
the Board did quite the correct thing when
it recently ordered the W.C.T.U. free kinder-
garten at Richmond to close the small, cheap
rooms it has had to use for the children in
its care. But, having closed the condemned
rooms, the State stopped right there, leaving
the rest to private charity or Providence—
and either party is liable to leave the evicted
children in the. gutter. It is a stupid way
of doing things.
Lame Kangaroo”: This saluting busi-
ness makes me tired. The boys at the
Norfolk War Hospital in Norwich got so
slack about it, especially in regard to officers
who stay at home in “cushie” jobs, that
military police have been posted at differ-
ent points, and any wounded soldier failing
to salute has his name taken with a view
to criming. A Black Watch boy who will

put up his fourth gold stripe on going out,
had his name taken for not turning “eyes
left,” his saluting arm being lifeless. One
of our own boys was inexcusably rude. On
being asked by a lisping juvenile, “Heven’t
you—er—been taught to salute?” he re-
plied, “My oath, and you’ll well learn,
too, when you get over yonder.” To bring
us to see our vileness the following order
has now been posted in every ward :
It has been brought under notice that saluting by
soldiers who are patients in hospital, on pass in
the city of Norwich, has become very slack and
careless.
In manv cases no attempt is made to salute
officers in uniform. It is a soldier’s duty to salute
all officers in uniform, and if unable to salute (owing
to wounds) in accordance with Sec. 16, Infantry'
Training, 1914, wounded soldiers must acknowledge
the King’s Commission by turning the head, as
described in para, vii., sec. 19, Infantry Training,
1914. In smoking, the soldier invariably removes the
cigar, cigarette or pipe from the mouth before
making the acknowledgment.
We go through hell, and when we escape
with limbs and bodies torn and nerves
frayed, we are harried and pestered over
things like this. Do you wonder that most
of our boys here are voting “No!”

The housebreaker and the pickpocket are
raw novices compared with the landshark
who subdivided a suburban “estate” outside
Melbourne recently. This expert, having
parcelled out his scrap of earth into allot-
ments 23ft. wide by 94ft. deep, allowed room
for a 50-feet street between them. The
blocks sold easily. But somebody apparentlv
foresaw that allotments at the tail end of
the street might not be rushed, so, to make
things look good, the pegs were placed 10
feet further out than the plan and the title-
deeds allowed for, thus giving the owners
10 feet more than they bought. None of
them seem to have measured the blocks, so
when the Council took over and started to
make the street, it ran its channels
and paths through fences and gardens, and
in some cases through verandahs. Now a
house —even a house with a 23ft. frontage—
with half its verandah sawn off and with the
front room where Gwendolyn works the
piano within handshake of the gutter, is not
exactly well placed ; therefore owners called
on the Council to see if the street couldn’t
be stretched, so to speak, without shifting
the fences. But the wiseacres who passed
the 23ft. frontage plan weren’t equal to the
feat and sent them on to the vendor; and as
he is at the front or the rear or somewhere
equally vague, they are no further ahead.
Even if they collided with him he would pro-
bably say the caper was a “custom of the
trade,’’ or that he didn’t know anything
about it, and decline to become interested in
the matter.
“Chevron”: Considering that he was born
in a country which is supposed to be quite
unable to make even a clothes-peg, the
resource of Billjim in manufacturing things
under difficulties calls for notice. While the
field-guns are making a colander of his work-
shop he sits in the trenches during ’ the
smoke-o between charges and fashions
articles which would adorn any library
table. An inkstand,
the work of Gunner
A. G. Smith (2nd
F.A, Brigade), is a
case in point. The
base is the heavy brass
four-armed clip used
for protecting the per-
cussion end of a shell-
case. To this are sol-
dered four Lebel bul-
lets, which act as sup-
porting columns to the
inkwell —a brass fuse
cap with another cap
soldered inside it. The
lid, fitted as true as if
turned at a lathe, is a
similar piece of war-
like brassware, bear-
ing the arms of Ypres
in relief, the whole
topped off by way of
handle with a machine-
gun bullet. The sol-
dering-iron was a piece
of copper; the solder,
lead melted from
bully-beef tins; and
the flux, the resin
scraped from the corks
of pickle-bottles. An-
other bombardier has
sent home a goblet
made from a French
soixante-quinze shell
case, engraved with a
figure of Britannia
and the words “Somne
—l9l6—Pozieres.” I
begin to suspect that the story about the
elotbes-peg is a lie.

Bearing on this question of marriage by
proxy, there are interesting figures in a
volume just issued by the Statistician in
N. S. Wales. During last year 4931 chil-
dren arrived under conditions which would
have made marriage by proxy or otherwise
desirable if it had not taken place in the
meantime. In addition, 1480 put in an
appearance before the bonds. This makes

be made. Incidentally, the illegitimacy
figures give no reason for thinking that
marriage by proxy is more urgently called
for now than at any other time —which is
something more to the credit of Billjim.
And the superstition that war leads' to
a great supply of male babies has no official
support. The latest statistics show that we
are merely getting about the average of 105
Billjims to every 100 Jemimas.
THE VESTED INTERESTS IN SIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Episcopal Convention at New York has post-
poned for three years the consideration of the revi-
sion of the Decalogue.”
The old, old sins are dear to us.
The old, old sins are sweet;
When Satan’s very near to us,
Then we can warm our feet.
Oh, we can warm our hearts and feet
And bid the w.owser yell
When cold Salvation drummers beat
Beyond the warmth of Hell.
We’ve served our long apprenticeship,
And learnt to sin in style ;
At novices we curl the lip,
At senior saints we smile;
For saintliness is very cheap,
But devilry comes high,
And crops of wild oats we’ve to reap
Make cocky wowsers sigh.
We’re very vain about our sins,
And swagger down the road;
But if the leering wowser wins
By altering the code,
So that our sins are penny faults! —
The thought turns us to stone.
We warn the wowser in his vaults:
“Here! leave that ‘log’ alone!”

Grey Hair Unnecessary.
A simple, old-fashioned home-made lotion that
will restore the color of youth.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily
be -changed back to a natural color in a
few days’ time merely by the application
of a simple, old-fashioned and perfectly
harmless home-made lotion. Procure from
your chemist two ounces of tamm'alite con-
centrate and mix it with three ounces of bay
rum. Apply this to the hair a few times
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing your grey hair gradu-
ally darkening to the desired shade. The
lotion is pleasant, not sticky or greasy, and
does not injure the hair in aqy way. ' [1

The newly-elected City Council of Adel-
aide, at its first meeting, kept up the old
ceremony of drinking in silence to the
memory of Col. Light. When the province
of South Aus. was founded, 80 years ago, it
fell to Light, as Surveyor-General, to say
where the capital should be. It might
easily have been at Glenelg, or Port Lincoln,
or on Kangaroo Island, or at the mouth of

the Murray. But he chose the present site,
on a plain between hills and sea, and set a
wide belt of park-lands all round it to keep
it from getting crowded. And outside the
Town Hall his statue stands, wdth a thumb
pointing down as to a plan, as one saying,
“Let it be there.” The massive loving-cup from
which the toast is drunk was sent from Lon-
don in 1859 by Montefiore and Currie and
others, who helped from a distance to found
the city, and whose own names are com-
memorated in various thoroughfares.

According to the hymn of Kipling
McAndrew, “the man who counts wi’ a’ his
runs a million miles o’ sea” was not going
to arrive until they got the loco, boiler aboard
and 40 miles an hour. But Mac. didn’t
count on the log that Greenstreet, the com-
modore master of the Maoi-iland Shipping
Co., had astern. Greenstreet has been with
that concern in sail or steam for all but 10
years of his half-century of life at sea, and
has made 90 voyages round the world with
plentiful side-line trips.
Bill-Marion Edwards, the alleged woman
who year after year insists on doing most
things that a man does, snubbed a court-
room full of inquisitive males in Melbourne
last week when he/she refused to say “Yes”
or “No” to counsel’s question, ‘‘Are you a
man or a woman?” “That is immaterial,”
coolly answered Billmarion, and then
appealed to Judge Box as to whether it was
necessary to answer such a question. His
Honor had nothing to say. The case was
one of sly-grog selling, and Billmarion, in
a sac suit, had been called as a witness by
the middle-aged lady who was defending the
case. There was nearly a stampede in
court _ when she admitted that she and
“Marion” had shared the same room for
three months. It was the most entertaining
sly-grog case Melbouime has had lately; but
it didn’t solve the Billmarion mystery.
When the final accounts are being made
up, there will be a big credit to the name
of Edith C. Onians, hon. secretary of Mel-
bourne City Newsboys’ Society. She has
been a mother to generations of lads that
have known no other; she has been their
constant correspondent when they write
home from the trenches and the sea ; and, as
their biographer, in “The Men of To-
morrow,” she has told what her boys are
doing, omitting all reference to what she
hei'self has done for them. To the society’s
knowledge, 327 of its old boys have joined
the colors, and many more have done so of
whom there is no record. One of them, in
Gallipoli, was buried at one o’clock in the
morning by the shell that killed Birdwood’s
A.D.C., Captain Onslow; another, 17 years
of age, bayoneted a Turkish sniper who had
shot the lad’s best pal the night before;
another was among the lads who raised the
chorus of “Australia Will Be There” when
the Southland was torpedoed. With the aid
of quiet little John Griffin, the manager and
assistant secretary, Miss Onians finds gut-
tersnipes and leaves them men; captures
newsboys and c’rect-card sellers, and teaches
them a trade; gives them clothing and self-
respect in exchange for rags and shiftless-
ness ; and lives in the hearts of rovers and
fighting men all round the world.

Government Shipping Master at Newcastle
(N.S.W.). While a leading pilot for the
coaly port the doctor shook his head and
Mclntosh was brought ashore. He didn’t
survive long to enjoy the easy s.m.’s job.
Death struck him suddenly, the blow the
more cruel because the victim was com-
paratively young.

Pope Cooper, Queensland’s Chief Justice,
is now the senior Supreme Court Judge in
Australia by length of service. He has been
on the bench 33 years.
A fine record was possessed by Mrs.
Sheppard, who died the other day at Mal-
vern (Vic.), aged 82. She was brought to
Melbourne in 1839, lived in Victoria for 77
years and had 15 children. The town of
Shepparton, the capital of the Goulburn
Valley, was named after her husband, who
had a station up that way.
Captain Foster Fyans. who gave his name
to Fyansford, near Geelong (Vic.), was at
one time Governor of Norfolk Island, the
“hell of the Pacific.” While he was there
a dozen, convicts broke loose, shook things
up and tried to leave the island. They were
caught and the captain sent to Sydney to
know what he should do with them. The
message that came back was: “Hang half
of them!” The captain’s trouble was to
know which half to spare, as they were all
much of a muchness. So he went round
and asked each one separately if he would
rather live or die. Six asked to be hanged
and six begged for their lives. This was
good enough for the captain, who hanged the
six who wished to live and spared the six
who preferred to die.
When the late Tosti composed his “Good-
Bye” he created something that was to send
waves of grief and depression round the
drawing-rooms of the world. Uncounted
millions of women have proved that they
possessed Hearts by staring vacantly at the
wall while the incantation was" wailed
by a singing sister. None of the other yearns
and moans by the same composer had the
liearse-and-plumes effect of his “Good-
Bye,” which earned him a British knight-
hood in 1908. Born at Naples in ’47, the
Italian grief-specialist was 29 when he went
to old London to set its draw-
ing-rooms sniffling. He lingered on till he
was 69, and died lately in Home, instead of
perishing poetically on a London sofa in ’96.
Walter Grant made last week’s Australian
record. With the aid of a small hacksaw, a
piece of wood from the broom in his cell,
four blankets torn into strips, and darkness
he escaped from Melbourne gaol before com-
pleting the first 24 hours of a two years’
sentence for forgery. Locked up at 5 p.m.
in a cell Bft. by 6ft. overlooking the remand
yard, 15ft. below, Grant placed his bed-board
against the wall, reached a window 7ft.
from the floor, and sawed through the bars.
With a rope made of the torn-up blankets he
squeezed through a space 15in. square and
dropped into the yard. Here he tied the
piece of wood to one end of the rope, and
threw it up so that it caught in the iron rail
of the watch-tower on the wall. Then he
pulled himself 25ft. to the coping-stone,
readjusted the rope, and slid down into
freedom. And the best a man with such
resource and daring can do for Australia is
to forge somebody else’s cheques! It is a
dreadful waste of invaluable material.
Formerly well-known on the Melbourne
Block, Edward Toynbee Stevens at one
time threatened to become a willie-boy. In-
stead he has put up an astonishingly good
performance. Educated at Brighton and Mel-
bourne Grammar Schools, he studied den-
tistry at the Uni. and was in practice in
Collins-street when the Kaiser ravished Bel-
gium. He got busy at once and left Aus-
tralia in charge of the machine-guns of the
sth Battalion. Illness in Egypt kept him
out of Gallipoli, and he was discharged medi-
cally unlit. But he sniffed a chance, went
to “Blighty,” cracked hardy, and got a com-
mission in a British regiment. He saw ser-
vice in France, Suvla (mentioned in des-
patches) and the desert. He has been
wounded four times, buried by a bursting
shell, and smitten with desert fever. Fie
was in charge of trench-mortars during the
Somme advance, and now, on Monash’s invi-
tation he has rejoined the Anzacs. Mel-
bourne scribblers will remember him as the
editor and producer of the short-lived “Aus-
tralian Onlooker.” His father is Edward
Stevens, partner in the drygoods firm of
Henry Berry.
Killed, near Ypres, after doing his bit at
Gallipoli and Pozieres, Lance-Corporal “Ted”
Cannon, a Ballarat boy who showed much
promise as a black-and-white artist and
water-colorist. Though only 19 when he
went into the firing-line, he had already won
a number of awards at art exhibitions in
London and elsewhere. The Victorian Edu-
cation Department awarded him a senior
technical scholarship entitling him to a five
years’ course of study free of cost, with £l5O
added. On reaching the Front he was given
the job of observing for the artillery. The
end came from a sniper’s bullet while he
was sketching a strong German position
from a perch in a tree. Father, E. J.
Cannon, is on the staff of Ballarat Courier.
J. T. Chia, ex-husband of actress Unie
Russell, who lived long at Pentridge after
shooting at Chinese Consul-General Hwang,
sends a copy of the Hongkong Mail with
this amiable paragraph in it: —
Mr. J. T. Chia, ex-Consular Secretary for China in
Melbourne, is passing through Hongkong on his way
to Peking. Mr. Chia, who was educated at Cam-
bridge, is a young man of progressive ideas, and
doubtless has a future before him in the service of
his country. He has a happy and pleasant impression
of his sojourn in Australia, and is convinced that the
trade intercourse between China and Australia will
grow tremendously.
Chia stayed in Sydney for a week or so on
his way north, and indicated to scores of
people that gaol hadn’t spoiled his Sassiety
manners. His friends have got him a very
good teaching job.
Father O’Dowling, a Jesuit who died
lately in South Aus., had a remarkable
career. He was born in Dublin in the
middle of last century, and when the
Fenians started out he seized a pike and
joined the Fenian Brotherhood, a small
army of which had gone to Ireland from
U.S.A. Three years later he put his pike,
away, joined the Jesuits and stuck to them.
DOCTOR’S ORDERS.
“What an extraordinary long cigarette-
holder, Mr. Smyth!"
“Yes, the doctor ordered me to keep away
from cigarettes.”
Little Longwood (Vic.) is buzzing again.
For gallantry at Pozieres, Lieut. Frank R.
Tubb has been awarded the Military Cross.
Although twice wounded, he displayed the
family grit in leading his men during a five-
days’ battle, retiring only when he received
his third wound. Major F. H. Tubb, who
won the V.C. as a lieutenant at Lone Pine,
is the lad’s eldest brother, and there are two
more of them in khaki.
THE HERO’S WIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am a noble soldier’s wife,
And yet I got a tale of woe;
For sorrer’s bittered all me life,
And troubles rise where’er I go.
Mv Danny marched away to war;
When he returned the wounds he bore
Made him a splendid figger for
The women folks, and that is why
Me blessed life is all awry.
I cannot leave that faithless hound
For half a minute anywhere,
But cheeky hussies gather round
To pat his back and stroke his ’air.
They tell him he’s a ’ero grand,
And want to kiss his pore, ’urt ’and,
Which that is more ’an I can stand.
To be a ’ero’s mighty swell;
To be a ’ero’s wife is ’ell 1
The other day I got so mad
I chucked a basin in his flee,
And put a mark upon me lad.
He done it up. all white and nice,
And when I sees him next a lot
Of girls is round him, talkin’ rot
Cause of that ’orrid wound he’d got.
’Ow did he get it? “Well, yeh see,
’Twas jist a pot-shot, girls,” sez he.
Bell Baxter mugs him much of late,
An’ if I starts to cut a shine
She sez, “It’s ’ero-worship, Kate.”
What right has she to worship mine?
Before he trotted off to fight
Girls made my Danny wild with fright;
But now he knows he’s brave all right
He always wants a score about.
I wisht he’d never found it out 1

Of course it can’t last. To-day we are spend-
ing the borrowed money, and> spending it by
the hands of men who are not in the habit
of doing it. That alwmys means riot and
waste; and the banks take their toll of the
plunder. But there is always the bill to pay
always the bad taste in the morning. The
chairman of this bank gave the shareholders
a reminder:—
Me cannot say how long- the war is going to last,
and furthermore when it is over we must expect
adjustments of prices as the result of channels
of trade, now closed, being again available, thereby
bringing our products into competition with the
world’s markets; and particular care should be
exercised with regard to land values in the country,
which are too often based on the day-to-dav prices of
the products earned from the land.
For its own part The Bulletin is not so
nervous about wheat and wool as it is about
some other things. It is doubtful whether
war conditions are responsible for any large
increase in the production of either of those
staples. But in regard to metals, for in-
stance, war prices have stimulated produc-
tion enormously, in the United States and
elsewhere, and with a struggle to hold the
market and a greatly diminished consumption
there will probably be a catastrophic slump
in metals. The one small consolation open
to shareholders is that, owing to taxation,
they haven’t been getting the cream, so they
won’t suffer much when there is none. Still
they are going to suffer.
Finding the whole world a fog, the
B.N.S.W. is steaming very cautiously. Here
are the principal balance-sheet figures in
1914-5-6:
Sept., ’l4. Sept., ’l5. Sept., ’l6.
Notes .. .. £287,655 £369,481 £455,620
Bills, etc. . . 6,594,816 9,729,074 7,616,870

Premises . . 795,000 825,000 835,000
The bank now owes £47,355,198 as against
£43,892,253 just after the war began; that
is £3,462,945 more. Of that amount no less
than £3,127,286 is held liquid. The very
small balance is in advances. The position
with regard to liquid assets is therefore
much stronger than it was at the beginning
of the war. There is now well over one-
half of all deposits and other liabilities in
hand; and more than half that total is
coin, bullion, cash balances and Australian
Commonwealth notes, these together repre-
senting 30 p.c. of all the debts of the bank —
a position offering most uncommon security.
Yet there seems on the surface of the figures
to have been a heavy shrinkage during the
past year in liquid assets. This, however,
is of no account. As at September, 1915,
the B.N.S.W. was holding no less than
£9,411,623 in Commonwealth notes, as com-
pared with the present £3,328.270. So there
seems to have been merely an exchange of
banking facilities between this bank and
the Commonwealth Bank, whose Governor
was formerly one of the B.N.S.W.’s inspec-
tors. The increase of this bank’s own note
issue, by the way, is due to the war-money
boom in Maoriland. where the banks still
provide the paper currency.

On a matter of highway robbery:—
Tf a man sells a mixture of sand and sugar on
the pretence that it is sugar, the victim has very
little difficulty in getting him severely punished.
But throughout the country men are busy selling
insurance, which is quite as important as sugar,
and is usually bought in fairly-large quantities, and
aie making the most villainous misrepresentations in
Older to do it. Sooner or later the law will have
to take note of this matter. For a long while there
was nothing very serious to complain of with regard
to the representations of insurance canvassers in
Austialia; but during the last few years new con-
cerns have gone on to the roads, and to meet the
wild promises of these people some of the men
attached to older concerns have also let themselves
mn wild. From Victoria—a country district, of course
a circumstantial story now comes of a canvasser
who ‘is insuring lives on the condition that you
need pay only the first premium; after that you
aie fiee if you borrow from the office any amount
I, P to what you are insured for.” Of course the
collection of a premium on any such representation is
a mere swindle. There is only one safe rule for
people who are approached by life-insurance can-
vassers : to believe not one word more than is in
the prospectus. There is not an office in Australia
which is too modest to say in print all that it is
piepared to do for its policy-holders. If it doesn’t
make the offer there in the clearest terms, the person
approached may be quite sure that office isn’t pre-
pared to do the thing, whatever it may be.

This co. got the most valuable concession
which the N. S. Wales Parliament has given
away for many years. Balmain wanted
light and it also wanted to get rid of its
garbage. “We’ll get rid of your garbage
for you,” said a syndicate, “and into the
bargain supply you with electricity as cheap
as the big City Council can make it.” Inci-
dentally, the syndicate, which soon became
a co., with a good deal of Dixson Trust
money in it, got the right to sell current to
neighboring municipalities. Under that
power contracts have been made with New-
town, Leichhardt, Petersham and Ashfield,
for periods of from 20 to 58 years. The
scheme has been a great success. At first,
of course, everything was going out and
little or nothing coming in; and when the
demand was far greater than had been con-
templated and the capital outlay conse-
quently larger, money was got with some
difficulty and 7 p.c. had to be paid for it,
with rights of conversion into shares. The
best comment on the prospects is that those
rights are being exercised. As at June,
1914, there was £125,000 owing on second
debentures. All that remained unconverted
on October 31 was £21,900.
The progress of the business is further
shown in this table :

But you mustn’t compare the profit in the
first table with the revenue in the second,
and conclude that the percentage of profit
is rapidly increasing, because it must be
remembered that as debentures are con-
verted interest outgoings are reduced and
profit is thus apparently increased. In
other words, what formerly went out as
interest now remains as profit and goes out
as dividend. As a matter of fact, the pro-
portion of working exes, to revenue is
gradually increasing in this as in most other
businesses. In 1913 it was 44.1 p.c. Now
it is 47.6 p.c.
The doubtful factor in estimating light-
ing cos.’ profits is the depreciation of plant.
The first table shows the amounts that have
been written off profits and transferred to
a depreciation account. The so far com-
paratively small amount actually spent on
repairs. renewals and maintenance is
charged direct to Profit and Loss. The pro-
vision is under 4 p.c. of the total capital
expenditure apart from land and buildings;
and it is doubtful whether this is enough.
If it isn’t, of course the profits are over-
stated. The replacement reserve, by the
way, is not invested apart from the - busi-
ness. In fact, the demand for money to put
into, the business is so constant that more
capital will have to be shortly asked for.

Feel the blimp? The census of new build-
ings within the Melbourne Board of Works
boundaries was finished the other day, and
it was shown that for every 100 that sprang
up in 1913 there were only 40 in the past
year. In the current year the record will
be worse. That and similar conditions else-
where chopped this co.’s profits off at one
end; and increasing exes, have got at them
with an axe the other end. Look at this:—
Gross Profits. Management Exes.

1915 . . 87,732 33,251
1916 . . 86,704 43,908
The directors open their mouths just long
enough to say that “the far-reaching effect
of present war conditions has been felt at
every point of our business in restricted
trade and increased exes., including £5500
additional taxation.” Nor is it easy to see
how things can be any better for' a good
while to come.
The co.’s head-office is in Melbourne, and
originally all its forest country was in
Maoriland. But there is so little kauri
forest left, and no chance of any new kauri
forest being available for the next century
or two, that in 1914 the directors looked
west and bought interests there and equipped
them. That explains some of the big move-
ments in the next table:—
1911. 1914. 1915. 1916.

Liquid assets 162,997 110,938 88,133 75,039
There is nothing to be particularly joyful
about in the past two years’ figures. The
co. owes £07.447 less; but in stock, stores,
shares and liquid assets it holds £84,284
less. That is to say. from this point of view
it has gone back £16,837 in two years.
But, as against that, this paper figures it
S™ the co - lias in tlle two years spent
±35,2i2 on new plant; and it may also have
bought a little forest property, though there
is no trace of it in the accounts. So there
isn t a great deal to be set against the wast-
age of the timber asset; indeed, it is doubt-
ful whether that wastage is quite counter-
balanced. That, however, is a difficult matter
to decide. This co., for instance, w T rote down
its forests for some years, and then on a re-
valuation found that, timber having got so
much dearer, what was left was worth about
as much as the whole forest was at the
outset. And though there is going to be a
temporary slump in the timber trade, the
general tendency of prices will still be up-
ward.

The co. has suffered a bit both ways. Com-
mission earnings are not so good as usual;
and exes., including taxes, are larger:—

™45 P- c - of the commission earnings in
1910; for the past year they were 72 p.c.,
and the increase is quite enough to give the
directors half-an-hour’s work to find out
what it s all about. Even now, however, very
nearly half the net earnings are laid by after
the 10 p.c. div. is paid. And there is no
reason at all to expect that the revenue will
diminish, because the estates on hand are
gradually increasing. Here are the figures
at various dates ;—*
1895 . , £482,987 1912 ~ £2,050,820

Mie future for profits therefore looks good ;
and the principal is well secured. The BO;
takes no risks outside those which any
trustee takes ; its whole capital is in Govern-
ment stock ; and its reserves are nearly all
in freeholds and leaseholds and advances to

Maoriland is revelling in meat-mdney and
War-loans; and the bill is put on the file
to be paid by and bye. So, in spite of high
charges and freights and insurances, the
profit for the year was greater than for any
previous term. What it is going to be
presently is another matter. So far the
Maoriland Government hasn’t come along
with anything heroic in the way of taxation.
But the interest bill will have to be paid ;
so the taxes will need to be heavy long
after the war-loans and the abnormal de-
mand for Maoriland’s meat and wool stop.
Fortunately for the shareholders in this
old-established concern they haven’t been
demoralised by big dividends, and last year
only two-thirds of the profits were distri-
buted. This allows for a considerable slump
in earnings without affecting the distribu-
tion.
There is, however, another point to con-
sider in connection with a trading co. What
are its assets like? Will they be seriously
affected by a slump? For it isn’t the shrink-
age of turnover and ordinary trading profits
that gets _ most concerns into trouble: it is
the loss in value of assets. Let us look,
therefore, at the next table :—-
1907. 1915. 1916
Pref. capital .. £125,000 £125,000 £125,000
Ord. capital .. 105,707 116,789 116,844
Liabilities . . 94,388 29,571 56 642
Stocks.. .. 150,312 122,972 154,’393

Premises, plant 152,261 155,287 156 143
Cash, etc. . . 215 4,571 3,155
Stocks, £154,893. As the chairman told the
shareholders, “the increase was due partly
to the greatly enhanced cost of all goods,
and partly to the foresight of their managers
and London buyers in looking well ahead
and keeping stocks fully assorted.” Large
profits have been made in the last couple
°f years by traders who have been
able to get war prices for goods purchased
prior to the war. The war may end very
suddenly. The chances are that it will'.
Then traders will find the position reversed.
Lhey will have large stocks purchased at
war prices; and. even though shipping will
be disorganised for a while, there will be no
enemy submarines to keep up insurances,
hundreds of vessels now bottled up will be
on the seas, and even if we don’t take enemy
goods somebody else will, and the result will
almost certainly be a rapid fall in prices.
For this reason there may have to be a
severe writing-down of stocks—unless
traders have done it already out of their
war-profits. They are very foolish if they
are not doing so. The co.’s book-debts
amount to £73,459. It is a big sum, but it
is. chaiacteristic of Maoriland, ’where credit
is much too easily got. In view of the
grave uncertainty as to the value of Maori-
land s staple products after the war., there
is danger in this item; and every effort
should be made to keep it down.

of deposits. But the shareholders are appar-
ently content with their comfortable 6 p.c.,
and'more content as every year makes it a
bit more certain and their principal a trifle
more secure. Besides, they are doing some-
thing for their city ; and that counts for a
good deal with the Bendigonir n. After all,
that old spirit of rivalry between Bendigo
and Ballarat had a lot to recommend it:
they at least struggled to make something
worthy of their jealousy.
The principal movements of the figures
in recent years are shown in the next
table: —•

shareholders’ point of view has been glanced
at already.

Lloyd’s copper (N.S.W.) has been re-
named the Abercrombie by a new co. with a
capital of £30,000; the mine and plant were
knocked down for next to nothing at a sale
in September. The old co. had a life that
was mostly a nightmare owing to local diffi-
culties and market slumps. But mineral
separation of low-grade ore and the sale of
concentrates or matte at Lithgow should pay
with copper at war prices.
* * * *
Mouramba (N.S.W.) had to close down
the Nymagee copper works when coke ran
out owing to the coal-strike. But that is
only temporary. The co. is progressive, and
is making additions and improvements to its
smelter and converting plant at Lithgow. In
1915 the co. confined its onerations to Nyma-
gee, handling 20,000 tons of ore for an aver-
age of 3.28 p.c. copper. Matte of 35 p.c.
grade is transported from Nymagee to
Lithgow; but that is no bar to profit. Great
Cobar paid splendid dividends when it railed
its matte to Lithgow, and that was a longer
haul. Nymagee matte blends remarkably
well with silicious ore, so Mouramba is a
buyer of the latter.
* * * *
Old Baker’s Creek (N.S.W.) is still
plugging away with the help of the Mines
Department. The co. since it reconstructed
in 1906 has made leeway to the extent of
£7380. For the half-year to September 30
the battery crushed 182 tons for 10430 z.
sdwt.; and costs took 90 p.c. of the gold
value. At 80s. per ounce the yield was
worth £4173 and the profit was £417. There
is nothing startling on the horizon. Even
the old rock explosions are now little more
than memories.
* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) is still securing
sufficient ore from various veins to show a
small profit. But, apparently, there is no
hope of anything permanent. Liquid assets
total £12,209, which the co. is holding on to
so long as there is a reasonable prospect of
buying another mine.
* * * *
Kalgoorlie and Boulder Miners’ Union,
after running its eye down the accident list
for the year, had a few severe remarks to
pass concerning working conditions in the
local mines. Several speakers were appre-
hensive about the safety of some of the
workings, and one blunt machine-man
declared that the western side of the Golden
Mile showed traces of a giant move in the
earth, and posts were cracking under the
strain. He predicted that some day there
would be a big tragedy in that locality.
What has the Mines Department got to say
about it?
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) has had another
subsidence. This time heavy rains caused
an exhausted stope at the south end of the
310 ft. level to cave in, and affected two
almost depleted stopes at the 100 ft. level.
As a result, the mill tonnage will have to be
reduced at once instead of, as originally in-
tended, in about two months’ time.
Riverina South (W.A.) is erecting a new
10-head battery, tube mills and grinding
pans, and is preparing to instal a vacuum
slimes plant. Early next year the co. ex-
pects to treat 60 tons a day, and to increase
the quantity to 100 tons shortly afterwards.
The manager estimates 12,000 tons of £3 ore
in sight. The deepest level is at 300 ft., and
a winze is down to 400 ft., at which point
the shoot is declared to be well and strong
and the ore to be “the same as that at Kal-
goorlie.” Approximately 46,000 tons have
been extracted from the show, averaging
645. over the plates, with 10s. more in the
tailings.
From Westonia: —
Edna May: Elaborate measures have been taken at
380 ft. (No. 5 level) to cope with any flow of water
that may be struck in crosscutting there. The reef
will be cut some time in January.
Edna May Deep Levels: Tom Duff is on the spot
and is propping up the market. There is practically
no change below, but some additions are being made
to the untidy and unsightly surface plant with a
view to assisting mining and milling.
’ Edna May Consolidated: Some months will elapse
before operations on the shoot recently exposed in
this show can be fully resumed. Optimists aver
that the co. has got hold of the makings of
another Edna May shoot, and on the strength of
this Westonia is trying to look bright.
Edna May Central’s reserves are gradually being-
added to as a result of vigorous development, and
the co. has hopes under the present practical manage-
ment of improving its position at depth.
Kalgoorlie hopes shortly to combine paint-
making with gold-mining. Dumps of
material and deposits of ochre suitable for
the production of all shades of paint have
been discovered, and a local syndicate is
getting ready to supply all ingredients ex-
cept white lead and linseed oil.
* * * *
Golden Point (W.A.) has obtained six
months’ exemption on its Westonia lease.
The application caused a good deal of annoy-
ance locally, and several objections were
lodged against it. No one, however, ap-
peared in court to substantiate them, so the
co. had a walk-over. The co. is now concen-
trating attention on its other delusion at
Comet Yale.
* * * *
Rimu No. 1, of Maoriland, has been
“listed” in Sydney. There are 50,000 shares
(25,000 paid to 205., 14,000 to 18s., 3000
to 11s. 4d., and 8000 in reserve). The co.
was formed to work a dredging area of 150
acres, containing, it is estimated, eight mil-
lion cub. yds.—an enormous quantity within
such limits; it means an average depth of
40ft. or thereabouts. Roughly there are
from 50,000 to 60,000 yards per acre, and
a modern dredge can easily get away with
that quantity in a month. Frank Powell, a
first-class man, reckoned that this No. 1
area would average 19d. per yard, and on
that figure one dredge should earn from
£4500 to £5OOO per month. Cut it down by
one-third and the joint would still be very
juicy. The machine is expected to start
work early next year, and those interested
will be disappointed if costs go beyond 4d.
a yard.
* * * *
In launching his scheme for the amalga-
mation of 40 Bendigo mines, E. C. Dyason
sees that difficulties will arise in fixing the
interest of each co. in the new concern; and,
since it might be feared that the promoters,
because they hold a preponderating interest
in many of the mines, might grab too much
for those particular cos., he makes the
suggestion that there should be a Board of
Arbitration “to consist of two nominees of
the Government, one of the Bendigo Stock
Exchange, one of the Bendigo Chamber of
Mines, and one of the promoters.” But why
should the promoters be represented on an
Arbitration Board appointed to make this
allotment? They ought to stand aside and
merely appear as a party before the Board.
It would be worth a good deal to gain the
goodwill of the miners. What about doing
an unusual thing and offering them repre-
sentation ?
The Speck’s Works Committee values the
Latrobe shale oil show at £60,000 in place of
the £125,000 the co. is asking. It reckons
that it would cost £150,000 extra to put in
a plant to turn out 13.000 tons of fuel oil
a year, and that is the least that would pay.
When the Committee reported there was
still ss. between the Commonwealth and the
State’s ideas of a fair price for fuel oil for
the navy. The Navy Department offered
£3 10s. per ton for 8000 tons a year for 10
years, and the State wanted £3 155.. and
doesn’t see how it can crawl lower. The
whole thing hinges on this contract. The
present consumption of fuel oil in Australia
is 15.000 tons a year, so these works, on the
13.000-ton scale, would nearly supply the lot,
while if the Tasmanian Government went to
16,000 a year, as recommended by expert
James Hardie, it would have to increase the
local demand or go in for export.
“Old ’Un” : Those who had the luck to see
the way Teddy Dyason jumped through his
B.Sc. and' B.M.E. courses couldn’t doubt his
quality; and Victoria has never before
seen so brilliant a mining compilation as his
report on the proposed Bendigo amalgama-
tion. He exhumes the dry bones of the
field with striking effect and exposes the out-
of-date methods that sent mines to an early
grave. If nothing ever comes of the scheme
—there is a lot of bull-headed opposition
among the vested-interest men—his report
will stand as the top mark of mining criti-
cism. One lie nailed is that Bendigo mining
was the cheapest known. Dyason clinches
the truth that all round it is dear, and on
that fact depends the best part of his fusion
structure. The three years’ agreement with
the mine employees provides settled working
conditions for a term ahead. What now has
to be seen is how far the fusion will be leg-
roped by the Dept, in respect to manning
the areas and how shareholders will act when
they know how the spoils are to be divided.
The suggestion for the appointment of an
independent committee to decide this is not
the least brilliant idea in Dyason’s scheme.
* # * *
Bill Gullock couldn’t keep Nuggetty Ajax,
Daylesford (Vic.), off the call-list last
half-year because his six months’ work at
the bottom levels didn’t disclose any fresh
shoots of gold. The Ajax lode is big; but
that is its only virtue. An attempt is to
be made at No. 8 level to wrench profits
out of the middle lode. But that is only a
chance. So also is whether the flat make
to the north at No. 7 is going to help
move things. This is the way with deep
mining at Daylesford. The best proved
patch in the mine looks to be the make
of stone picked up a while back above No.
5 level. The co. has had a short and merry
life, for out of £113,667 of gold divs. of
£39,750 were paid. Then came the relapse
to the Government grant-in-aid stage, and
the position is not much better to-day.

Blair Athol i'Q.) sheds another sixpenny
for the half-year. The term showed a net
profit of £3185 from 36,385 tons of coal, and
it isn’t everv colliery that can make a profit
like that. The Queensland Railways are a
good customer —so good that there was talk
of the mine becoming State property; but
the deal hasn’t been clinched.
Blair Athol has been returning over 10
p.c. on its capital, and there are very few
collieries in N. S. Wales that have done as
well as that. Eight of the largest of them, with
an aggregate capital of £2,097,553, show an
alleged profit of £140,401 for 12 months. A
lot of that isn’t true profit though, because
few colliery cos. make proper provision for
writing-down their wasting asset.
Tongkah Harbor during 1915-16 did better
work than ever, but on lower-grade dirt.
Figures ran out this way :
1914. 1915. 1916.
Dredged, c. yds.. . 2,199,408 2,968,600 3,363,750
Tin Oxide, c. yds. 1,126 1,262 1,076

Value per c. yd.. . 11.790 d. 9.966 d. 8.204 d.
Value output .. £108,052 £123,260 £114,993
In 1914 the co. received £96 per ton of tin
oxide; in 1916, £lO6 16s. It is the other
way round with the average grade of the
ground, which has dropped a third in values
in two years. Now comes this message from
general-manager Lewis: —
As the boring so far done has proved ground
sufficient for the next three years adjoining the
main block of workings, attention will be given to
boring further afield. The bored areas vary con-
siderablv in nature of ground and values, but on
the whole should enable the co. to maintain its usual
yields.
That “on the whole” looks like a further
shrinkage. The year’s divs. swallowed
£20,692 more than net profits produced, the
difference being made up from cash reserves.
There is something gritty in the way
barrister Meagher is brushing away the
buzz-flies that are pestering him over Trong
Tin. His chief defence is that the boring
plan issued with the prospectus showed
uneven values in the tin drift. Well, what
if they did? That delectable property, the
Kampong Kamunting, had bores that jumped
from 0.201 b. per cub. yd. to 41b., but it
wasn’t because of such zig-zags that the
Freemans took the claim in hand. The
reason was that the average over-all of the
ground was 1.251 b. per cub. yd., and that
was also the average value of Trong,
so the latter’s prospectus said. Even
Meagher’s early pet lamb, the Tongkah
Compound, gave unevenness in boring re-
sults ; but the average returns from the
dredge compared well with the average bore
results. That is where Trong has failed.
Did not the prospectus say that the karang
(drift) in the northern valley was lift,
thick over 150 acres of an average value
of 2.361 b. per cub. yd.? Also that below
it 10ft. of silt and fine sand made an average
value of 1.251 b. of tin oxide per cub. yd.
over-all ?

Tas. Govt. Geologist Twelvetrees has
issued his report on the suitability of the
Beaconsfield limestone deposits for making
Portland cement. There is good quality
limestone in sight to last a 500-barrel-per-
day plant for 50 years, with plenty more
partly opened up close handy, he says.
There is a good site for works, with clay
and shale and water near by, though the
clay and shale require a little more investi-
gation for quantity. It is within easy dis-
tance of a good port, with the old Tas-
mania mine tramway already bridging half
the distance. The codlin in the apple is
coal, which would have to be brought from
the Tas. East Coast or N. S. Wales. Never-
theless. Twelvetrees considers that, with a
plant to produce 500 tons a week, cement
could be manufactured for £2 per ton. The
present price in Launceston is £6, so there
seems to be plenty of margin there. Whether
there is a big enough market is another
matter. But with cheap power from hydro-
electric works, which is on the cards, the
proposition might be able to compete in
Australia.
T. Cook, of Queenstown (Tas.), is ship-
ping six tons of baryta for experimental
treatment. The mineral was taken from a
big deposit close to the Lake Margaret tram-
way. The owners talk about working on a
big scale if the results prove satisfactory.
* * * #
“D.F.”: The surveyors put on to the
Arthur Lake water-power proposition by
the Speck’s Government have reported, that
probably 45,000 h.p. could be got there.
There is also talk of big water-power from
the Franklin and the King River on the
West Coast. But the State Ministry will
have to scratch for a while to find the
£171,500 it is asking Parliament to vote to
even extend the present Great Lake scheme.
If it gets this the cost of the Great Lake
works will have run to £637,000, or about
£1.00,000 more than the estimate. But
what’s £100,000?

Sydney, December 11, 1916.
My Dear Arini. —
Whoever is responsible for borrowing the
Baldwin Spencer collection of Australian
pictures to exhibit in the Sydney National
Gallery deserves a vote of thanks from this
State. The 41 Streetons alone are worth
a pilgrimage. Nearly all are good and at
least three are excellent —“Sydney Harbor,”
“The Centre of the Empire” (Trafalgar
Square) and “Venice.” Then there are a
dozen of Hilder’s best, an early Conder, a
capital portrait study by Harley Gilffiths,
anl representative specimens of the work of
Miss Rodway, Sid Long, Phillips-Fox, Tom
Roberts, Gruner, Withers, Julian Ashton,
Heysen and others. One little lot that par-
ticularly interested me bore the name of
W. B. Mclnnes, the capable young Victorian
whom I mentioned a few weeks ago. His
work has not been seen here before, nor
have the charming pastels of Miss Cumbrae
Stewart and the landscapes of A. McLintock
and M. H. McNally. In black and white
Norman Lindsay takes up most space;
Lionel and Percy Lindsay, Shirlow, Syd
Smith, George Lambert and Phil May are
also present.
Such a fine private collection of Austra-
lian work has not been made in Australia
before. Melbourne’s biology professor is a
collector with taste and judgment, who was
able to spot geniuses while they were still
young and modest. If there were a few more
like him to encourage Australian art we
might be able to keep our artists in Aus-
tralia.
If you drop off tne tram at Wattle-sti-eet,
where indeed is no vestige of the yellow
fluffiness, but only the raucous horn of the
motoi*-waggon and the white-gloved hand of
the policeman waving in majesty every now
and then so that the mere walker on the
face of the earth may cross from kerb to
kerb, you’ll finally run the Teachers’ College
to earth in a place they call Blackfriars,
but which from the plenitude of fishadaehip
signs in the neighboi-hood should be spelt
“fryei’S.” The students of the college who
are to pass on the torch to a still younger
Australia have just held an exhibition of
drawing, applieu art and manual work.
Judging by the fine display in all three
classes the students have caught the fire of
their instructors’ enthusiasm. Borne of the
woi'k in the drawing and applied-art section
was so good as to make you wonder why
you hadn’t heard of it before. Little artist
Rita Young, a slip of a girl in a mass of
fair hair and a pale-blue party dress, has,
I’m sui’e, been nominated by the folk who
live in nursery rhvmes as their Portrait-
Painter-in-Chief. In the manual work you
see the march of progress from the doll’s
frock to the up-to-date dress model, or from
the doll’s house-furniture up to the rest-
ful Morris chair. There are sets of
paper furniture, and nursery stories illus-
trated bv cut-out paper figures or black-
board drawings. That’s how they feach in
the Kindergarten now. And I want to run
back down to the third stairway in the
years, and start school over again.
The big Rajah of Pudukota hurried off
by the Kaisar-i-Hind to see how his king-
dom is getting on without its chieftain. Mrs.
Pudukota and the baby, I believe, stay in
Australia while father adjusts his jewelled
turban in the coral strand.
Miss Jean Pirie has packed a sprig o’
white heather among her kilties, and is on
her way from the land of cakes to link up
with her bit of the Australian Navy—
Engineer-Lieut. Douglass Phillips Herbert,
who plucked various decorations from the
Sydney Uni. Lieut. Herbert is at the
moment helping to sweep the waters clear
of the Hun. He is the elder son of the
Herberts of Romo, Mosman, and his lassie
is a daughter of the James Pixies of Edin-
burgh, and comes of academic stock.
The falling feather of romance drifted
into the Rolls-Royce (or is it a Studebaker?)
of Norman Stephen the other Saturday,
when he and a party of friends were taking
tea to the workers in French’s Forest.
Norman, a son . of late lawyer C. 8.,
is the manager of a Pitt-street bank,
a bachelor of long standing and the
owner of precious stones and chariots, oxen
and kine, maid-servants and man-servants,
or at any rate their cash equivalent, and the
lady is Miss J. Wiltshire, whose orettv hair
is set on a finely-poised head. The wedding
will take place this week.
J. J. Virgo, the perambulating chief of
Y.M.C.A.’s war-time activities, i*ushed up
to Leura to open a fete. Organised by
Mrs. Simpson, it had a gilt-edged idea which
city damsels might pause to think on in
their hunt for novelties. The show in St.
Alban’s Hall, with the cicadas chanting a
full orchestral accompaniment outside, was
alphabetical. By the time the confiding
visitor had arrived at Z he was about
stony-broke. Maidens with the genuine
mountain bloom on their cheeks fluttered
around from Alpha to Omega, and did a
roaring business amongst summer visitors.
R stood for refreshments, and needed no
introduction. The usual light-hearted odd-
ments, kiddies with cheeks like red cherries,
and every other pet dog in the village, l-olled
over each other in the gleeful gathering.
Funds go to help the Y.M.C.A. work at the
Front.
Mrs. Langer Owen addressed a meeting
of the Red Cross at the Town and Country
Club the other afternoon. The topic, toys
and basket-making for returned wounded,
gave a good peg on which to hang the pro-
ject of a shop that’s to be opened in Pitt-
street for the sale of soldiers’ work. Already
Randwick Hospital adds “Instruction in
toy and basket-making” to the usual physic.
The Women’s Handicrafts show is so
much better in quality—notably the gossa-
mer needlecraft—that the smaller quantity
doesn’t matter. Mrs. Thias, a fairly recent
arrival, who learned how to do clever things
in France, turned out some miracles in the
kind of thing Australian girls put into their
glory-boxes. Some of the curtains, such as
a pair of white satin with a landscape
painted on the shimmer, would take a lot of
living up to. Mrs. Spring’s repousse over-
mantel, with a forest of tall gums sil-
houetted against a flaming sky, was a thing
of joy any woman might have liked to take
home.
Women’s Clubs have had to take notice
of the skyward tendency of the breakfast
chop. The club in Stanway House has
washed its hands of the worry and called in
a housekeeper, who will have the agreeable
task of sitting on the bouncing bills if they
mount any higher.
The Arts and Crafts girls have a summer
sale from December 14 to 22. Take the lift
in Norwich Chambers.
Prof. Irvine, the Economics specialist at
the Uni., gave a few helpful remarks on
“The Child” at the annual break-up party
of the Free Kindergarten Training College.
Peter Board handed the budding school-
marms their diplomas. Miss Dumolo had
the dark-eyed Miss Benjamin to help her
greet the visitors.
The tall, slender Lady Tennyson, whp,
after a reign in Adelaide, was vice-queen at
our old Government House, is dead of pneu-
monia. Greatly addicted to Good Works,
she didn’t care much for the social side of
her Governor’s billet,. Besides, the old
Laureate’s son was no millionaire, and
economy had to be practised from larder to
ballroom to make the official income go
round and leave a bit over for a rainy day.
The Maoriland Returned Soldiers’ Asso-
ciation, formed recently to grasp the hands
of countrymen passing to and from M.L.,
has decided to alter and occupy the overhead
room of the Red Cross Book Depot, Pitt-
street. What the Ass. will do in the enter-
taining line must depend on circumstances;
but the energetic Mrs. Robert Williams and
her sister-seci’etary have large hopes.
For three or four months a gigantic wax
doll in white knitted garments has been
coin-gathei*ing by means of a raffle in aid of
A. S. Comforts and South Sydney Hospital
X-Ray installation. The doll was given by
Mrs. L. Rich, of Rose Bay, and won by
Mrs. Nelson, of Eastwood. And how much
do you think the young lady netted for the
two funds? Why, £4l!
Sydney drips money. The Red Cross
Book centre in Pitt-street seated a pretty
girl at its door with a table full of Souter
cat calendars and Christmas cards at six-
pence each, and in a few weeks she turns
over £165, and is still minting money!
Don’t forget the matinde in aid of the
Hospice for the Dying at Her Majesty’s on
the 14th (Thursday). An all-star pro-
gramme, with a Prof. Musicians’ orchestra
conducted bv Andrew McCunn. As a kind
of interjection, let it be known that Mrs.
Eva Wunderlich and some girl assistants
sold flowers outside the _ Australia last
Friday, and boxed £46 in aid of the worthy
institution.
Mrs. Percy Huntei’, who has been doing
a long rest-cure at Kii’keton, is now out and
about trying to make up her mind whether
Manly or Alice Springs has the best recu-
perative air. The eldest Hunter boy is try-
ing his literary pinions on a Honolulu paper.
Clarry Bridge, eldest son of Clarence,
senior, has been, to the great joy of his
family, transferred to a war vessel in our
own waters as senior engineer.
The death of Mrs. Harold McLean, at
Darling Point, removes another of the well-
known Campbell clan of Bathurst. Her
husband, who used to be Controller of
Prisons, went to Tasmania from Scotland in
the early days. By the way, over 1100
McLeans are fighting at the Front. Aus-
tralia has sent more than one and a half.
Last week Pitt, Son and Badgery left off
wondering what the British Government is
going to pay Australia for its wool-clip
to sorrow with their secretary, Mr. W. M.
Wright. Word had come to him that his
son—another “Bill” —had been killed in
France. The bright, wholesome lad had
spent his 21st birthday in an artillery gun-
pit in Flanders after grilling for a summer
in Egypt.
Di\ Boyes Mugliston and his wife are
mourning the loss of their fine lad Tom,
killed in France a couple of weeks or so
ago. He was one of the “stickers” who,
after being wounded four times, was again
back in the trenches when the last call
came. So works out the great voluntary
system. The Neutral Bay soldier had four
helpings of the enemy’s metal, while the
lads who shouted “No” are getting nothing
worse than sunburn in the surf.
' Teacher Cecil Sapsford is smiling over
the reception given to pupil Colin Crane at
the Phil. Society last Thursday. Colin
is a basso cantante, and the critics who
heard his rendering of “With Joy the Im-
patient Husbandman” from “The Seasons,”
and “ ’Mid Banks of Roses” from Berlioz’s
dramatic cantata are tipping him for a place
in the sun.
And this is old friend Kate Rooney, who
walked down the gangplank of the Ventura
safe and sound after crossing from the
Neutral States. Though Woodrow Wilson
has been using them up so freely, the lady
managed to get quite a heap of notes away
from the greenback country. But they’re
dramatic contralto ones—and we’re all
hoping we shall have a chance to hear them
again.
A spoonful of tonic was administered to
the rather Edith Cavell House Fund
at St. James’s Hall. Bright-faced V.A.D.’s
thi*onged the gangways and sang a song o’
sixpence as they peddled programmes and
sweets, with a smile thrown in for good
measure. There was an appetiser of young
things in tableaux vivants, silhouettes and
the evergreen love-scenes from “Samson and
Delilah” and “La Bohfeme.” Then came the
solid part of the bill —war pictures taken
from Mons to Gallipoli.
Mrs. Jameson, whose Westralian stories
attracted much attention, has taken up her
pen again—this time as champion of the
fatherless and motherless. “Peter’s Nation-
ality” is a touching story of a lonely little
boy. How Peter, cowed, ill-fed and at the
mercy of German bullies, strikes a blow in
defence of one even more helpless than him-
self, and in delivering that blow is flooded
with the knowledge that he is “all Aus-
tralian,” is told with charm. And, by the
way, it is the scenery of Berowra that Mrs.
Jameson has put in these pages. The book
was written in her little week-end cottage
tucked away amid the glories of Nature.
It’s the best advertisement Berowra could
have.
How well Verbrugghen manages these
things! As usual, when he waved his
ebony on Saturday afternoon the Heavenly
Choir lent a hand and rendered an im-
pressive accompaniment of thunder and
lightning to the Heroic Symphony. The
Town Hall was comfoi’tably filled, and the
audience was keenly appreciative of the
three-course meal, which on this occasion
was served at table d'hote prices.
Is it the weepiness of the season that
accounts for the extraordinary beauty of
the wild flowers this year? The Christmas
bush is a glory, and the Christmas bells
are so large that one expects the head
of a May Gibbs elf to peep out any
minute. By the way, did you see the V\ est-
ralian bells on the stalls last j
These bloom in small bunches at the head
of rather thick green stalks, and have the
most delicate green veinings inside their long
pink hoods.
Talking of flowers reminds me of a new
“all Australian” society that has been
formed. The teacher was exhorting her Bun-
day-school class to be kind to animals and
insects. “When I was a little girl, she
said, “I would often keep a locust tied up
in my handkerchief all day long, never think-
ing I was being cruel.” There was an im-
pressed silence. Next Sunday _ she. was
puzzled to see that all the little girls in the
first two rows and some little boys at the
back were proudly displaying a green rosette
on the left shoulder. At last her curiosity
overcame her. “Is it any special day, chil-
dren?” she asked. “No, Miss,” with
breathless eagerness from the class. “Then
why are you all wearing a green rosette?”
“Please, Miss, we’ve formed a Society for
Being Kind to Locusts !”
A Sydney icecream manufacturer in a
small way threw up his hands when the coal
strike threatened him with ruin. But when
he was calmer he put some of his own cream
on his brow and went away to think. The
result was that he got a bicycle, removed
the front wheel and back tyre, mounted the
remains of the machine on a wooden frame
and connected the tyreless back wheel with
the icecream machine by a rope belt. Then
he whistled in three youths from the street,
showed them the stationary bicycle and the
icecream, and told them to pedal in turn.
He was never short of “labor,” and the
“works” continued to make their 50 or 60
gallons a day.
Every flapper thinks it would be “lovely”
to marry an artist and watch him paint
beautiful, oil pictures in a velvet coat. That’s
the ideal; the real, that most artists’ wives
know, is the agony of watching the old man
in his shirt-sleeves laboriously and blas-
phemously drawing a pair of “Borndrunk’s
Everwear Boots, 275. 6d.,” and gloomily
anticipating the sort of criticisms the
wretched Borndrunk will pass when he sees
the drawing. An artist’s wife who sued for
a divorce in Sydney last week told his
Honor how her husband had induced her to
come to Sydney, “where he was well
known,” and how Fame had advanced to
meet him with a laurel wreath in one hand
and an order for a jamtin label in the other.
Like a nice horror? No? Then skip a
paragraph. A man fell overboard from the
Milson’s Point ferry one day last week. The
engines were reversed at once, and, when
those aboard dragged him out of the swirl-
ing water, they found that the propeller-
blades had done dreadful things. Some
work-girls in a factory overlooking Circular
Quay heard the first shouts and ran to see
what the trouble was. Their report was:
“A girl in a red dress has fallen overboard !”
A red dress!
Maud Butler is a grey-eyed slip of Aus-
tralia now smilingly attending to the wants
of the returned soldiers in the tea-room
attached to the 11.5. A. dugout in Macdonell
House. “I love the work here, and feel I’m
helping- a little, but” —and here the grey
eyes grow rather wistful—“l wanted to fight
for Australia —to go right through with the
boys.” This is her modest explanation of
two attempts she made to get away with the
troops. “It was my boots gave me away the
first time. They wex-en’t military style. Yet
even the O.C. took me for a boy-stowaway
and said he would let me go along if the
doctor passed me as medically fit. Then I
had to own up.” "The drill ?” “Oh, I knew
the drill and signalling, and I can shoot and
ride with any of the boys. I’m a counti’y
girl.” “I wanted to go through with the
boys!” If that’s not pure Anzac, what is?
Another out-going passenger early next
year will be one of the Macfarlane girls,
whose name you’ve seen on scores of soldiers’
portraits. She goes to London, and as father
is making for Burma, the family seems to
have caught the wanderlust.
I hope I shall have to resurrect Vernon
Lorimer, the Sydney artist who was
reported killed last week. A regimental
mate, returned wounded, reported Vernon’s
death; but as neither Base Records nor the
family have heard of it, the regimental mate
was almost certainly wrong.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

THE GENUINE
Pianola Piano
The ability to play the Piano —
to express clearly, perfectly,
the music that is within you.
Pianola has won fame first, of course, be-
■ll cause it is a wonderful musical instrument—
(LfL an instrument made by men who take a
wholesome pride in producing the finest
musical instruments in the world.
But chiefly, the Pianola has found its high place in
the regard of all nations because it represents a great
and original idea. Because its coming proclaimed
the emancipation of music—brought the finest enjoy-
ment in music within the ability of all.
You, whether you know little or much of music,
may sit at this remarkable, modern instrument and
play. Play with a wealth of artistic power and ex-
pression, a beauty of musical effect that few of the
most talented amateur pianists can equal.
Such facility 1 and perfection of result is possible
with the Pianola alone of all player-pianos. That is
why the supremacy of the Pianola has been a per-
manent one. That is why men of all nations who
through culture, education and fine associations have
acquired a preference for the best, choose snvariaby
the Pianola.
The Pianola is made by the Pianola
Company in these models only —
Stein way, Steck, Stroud, Aeolian and
famous Weber. They are priced no
higher than other player-pianos .

Melbourne, December 11, 1916.
Mr Dear Yarrie, —
Something in the Argus has made Mel-
bourne’s insects buzz, and George Michael
Prendergast, M.L.A., who in these matters,
as Dave “Ithuriel” Maling once put it, is
a good deal more Michael than George,
wants to know what about it. An ad.
appeared calling for “two parlormaids for
State Government House, salary 20s. a
week, Protestant, experience, personal refer-
ences.” Governor Stanley himself disclaimed
all knowledge of the matter, and expressed
annoyance about it at the Executive Council
meeting. But George Michael is asking for
a public apology, and the Argus is trying
to track the ad. to its source. There the
matter stands, Billy Hughes having told
Billy Maloney, who brought it under notice
in the Reps., that it was no business of the
Commonwealth, anyhow. But Toorak is
talking, and the Wimmen’s National League
may yet become embroiled with the Irish
National Foresters and the Hiberr-nians.
Lady Helen braved the perils of “Lillie
Boulke” street on Wednesday evening and
went to see the Newsboys at work in Coro-
mandel-place. Miss Edith Onians explained
all the workings of the Institution, all except
her own brave share.
Lady Stanley is opening the new wing of
the Women’s Hospital this week, and there
is joy in the hearts of the doctors, nurses
and committee who have to tell sick people
there is no room. As things are at present,
there are always so many waiting that no
patient can be kept in hospital an
hour longer than is absolutely essential.
There is to be a concert to celebrate the
event. Evelyn Ashley, Miss Millie Macan
la pupil of Melba), Ambrose McMahon and
Hal Elvins are sorting out the programme
between them.
Colonel Leslie Maygar, V.C., of Euroa,
was in the dusty doing at Katia, east of the
Suez Canal, when the Light Horse managed
to put its trade-mark upon at least half of
the enemy’s force of 18,000. The British
commander in Egypt, in his despatch deal-
ing with the matter, has given Maygar some
of the credit, and bespeaks a cheer for
Colonel Rupert Downes, of the A.M.C.,
another Victorian. Both were on Gallipoli
during a large part of the campaign.
Brigadier-Gen. Tivey has been wounded in
France. But apparently it is only a little
one, for his wife has a cable telling her that
he has continued on duty at Brigade Head-
quarters.
Maoriland’s late P.M.G., Heaton Rhodes,
having seen the session settled, leaves for
Egypt to make himself generally useful again.
Rhodes, who ranks as colonel, married a
sister of Alaister Clark, Melbourne’s amateur
flower-fancier, and hasn’t any need to take
thought for to-morrow’s breakfast.
The death of Lieut. Desmond, elder of
Justice Duffy’s fighting sons, is also the
tragedy of one outside the family circle.
His engagement to a popular society belle
(Madge Back) commenced with his camp
life.
Lieut. Miles O’Hara, elder boy of the
surgeon by his third wife, has just emerged
from a hospital theatre whither he was
carried after being wounded. Osborne, the
surgeon’s only child by his second wife, fell
in action early this year, and one of his
first family is still busy in the trenches.
Little ex-Melbournite Vida Mills, who is
now Mrs. Jim Burns, has been up from
Sydney seeing her soldier-husband off to
the war. Vida was supported by her sloe-
eyed sister-in-law, Gipsy Burns, who lives
in the heavenly Burns home at Parramatta.
The G.-G. pair gave the girls bed and break-
fast whilst here. Jack Burns, another of
the clan, went back to duty in Egypt some
weeks ago.
Mrs. Ramsay is about town with her
heavily-gilded naval husband rolling along-
side. The big, fair Captain is taking over
a new ship or doing something else sensa-
tional. His happy young wife hangs on his
starboard arm and smiles at the world. It
is something to be able to show off a sea-
going husband these days.
Peter Schuler’s war book has been pub-
lished in England, and his numerous adorers
are impatient at the thought of having to
wait weeks for first copies of the precious
volume.
The Brighton Red Cross dames are clear-
ing or cluttering the decks for a real heavy-
weight bazaar like the show that raked in
thousands Cup-time before last. It is
booked for February.
Mrs. Sharp made £lOO for the Berwick
Red Cross out of a clever thought. She
packed a soldier’s box and then took penny
votes to decide which Billjim should get it.
Adelaide kisseth the Book :
The Edith Cavell Memorial Fund has established
club rooms for army nurses on North Terrace. There
is a lounge, reading-room, bathroom and bedroom,
with tea-rooms handy, and the lot are to be open to
army nurses and V.A.D.’s from 10 a.m. till 9.30
p.m. each day.
The Soldiers’ Fund has published an account of its
work for the six months ended September 30:
Income, over £lOl,OOO (including £95,000 from
Australia Day) ; expenditure, nearly £21,000
( £16,980 went in relief, £919 in administrative
expenses, and the balance in paying Australia Day
bills). The fund still has over £325,000 to rattle.
On Saturday a committee of girls, with Elaine
Cook as secretary, ran a Christmas tree for soldiers’
children, and 150 youngsters were made happy.
The late George Downer’s estate has been sworn
at £400,000. The fortune goes to the children of his
three brothers and his sister, all four of whom
predeceased him.
Capt. Bulkeley Johnson, who is to be one of the
Duke of Devonshire’s A.D.C.’s in Canada, belongs to
the Kent Hughes clan, of old Adelaide. The family
is better known in Melbourne nowadays. But it was
our copper-mines that gilded the family tree.
H. W. B. Cairns, the new Rhodes scholar, who is
house-surgeon at the Children’s Hospital, has nearly
12 months’ active service to his credit, and is still
under 21. When he was 13 he won a scholarship
that gave him three years’ secondary education. A
bursary then took him to the University, where he
began his medical course, passing in both his first
and third years first-class. Then he went to the
war, but returned in March last to pass his fourth
year’s exams, first-class and to tie for the Davies
Thomas scholarship. His home is at Riverton.
A cold douche has been administered to the move-
ment in favor of altering school-hours in January and
February: Premier Vaughan, announces that the
Government doesn’t favor it. The suggestion, which
was that the day’s work should be from 8 to 1, with
two quarter-hour spells, originated with the Teachers’
Union, and to get the widest possible opinion on
the matter a vote is being taken among teachers and
parents.
The management of the Botanic Gardens is still
unsettled. The Government’s latest story is that
Professor Osborn was “suggested,” not “appointed,”
as Dr. Holtze’s successor. Apparently Holtze is to
remain where he is till March, at least. Meanwhile
there are hints that later on provision will be made
for a considerable extension of the present grounds,
or the selection of a new site.
Captain Blackburn, V.C., is home and has been
entertained by the St. Peter’s Old Collegians’ Associa-
tion, the Stock Exchange and the Law Society, and
has visited his old school. On Monday at lunch he
will pick a bone with the Government. Like a good
Australian he is more inclined to speak of other
men’s doings than his own, and at the law dinner
extolled the achievements of Captain Gordon Camp-
bell and whispered that a “very high honor” was to
be awarded him. Captain Campbell is the youngest
son of the late Dr. Allan Campbell and a nephew of
the late Chief Justice. His elder brother, who en-
listed from W.A., was badly wounded at Gallipoli and
has since been very ill.
The march-feminine proceeds, ’spite the fact that
the municipal elections went against the two nomi-
nees of the Women’s Non-Party Association. The
Board of Governors of the Public Library now in-
cludes a woman (Mrs. J. F. Young) for the first time
in its history. She has always been a keen advocate
of Effective Voting, and has practically carried
on the work commenced by Miss Spence. Since the
war she has devoted herself chiefly to patriotic work
and it is mainly owing to her that the Wattle Day
League has been able to send so many motor-ambu-
lances to the Front.
The late Herbert Hughes’s estate has been set
down at £90,000. He was the owner of Booyoolie
station, you remember.
From England comes news of the death of James
Fowler, son of the late David Fowler and a director
of D. and J. Fowler, Ltd. His wife, who died a few
months ago, was a daughter of the late William
Morgan, a former Premier. A son is in the British
Flying Corps.
At the opening of the Wonderland Fete, promoted
by the Children’s Patriotic Fund Committee in aid
of the Repatriation Fund, and held at the Exhibi-
tion, Lady Galway eulogised the work that the
schools have ‘done. In the year they have collected
nearly £3OOO, and the first day of “Wonderland”
brought in another £lOOO. On the same day a com-
mittee took charge of the Adelaide Oval, where an
Inter-Collegiate cricket match was played to raise
funds for the A.C.F. Coffee Stalls at the Front.
Few (governors’ wives have been more popular here
than the late Lady Tennyson. She identified herself
closely with the life of the State. Particularly she
had always a helping hand for girls who were trying
to make their own way. At the time of the Duke
of York’s visit more than one amateur had her work
brought under royal notice, and both she and her
Governor were patrons of the best kind —buying
patrons—of work that showed any promise. She felt
keenly the death of her youngest son, who went down
in one of the naval engagements, and no doubt that
shock made her less able to fight against the pneu-
monia that killed her.
Bendigo at present holds one triumphant
and happy maiden —Marjorie Eadie, daughter
of the doctor. She is busy preparing her
trousseau and the wedding is timed for
March and London. Her triumph is mostly
due to the fact that she has gained the family
consent to wed the man of her choice —
Rupert Wertheim. Father said “No” for a
while, but the young man has done such good
work in the French trenches that all opposi-
tion has been withdrawn.
A bride of the moment has included green
nighties in her trousseau —art green. This
Babette is probably after a Venus-rising-
from-the-sea effect.
The widow Sheppard, who spent her
declining quarter-century as a pioneer of
Malvern, died last week. Five years after
the beginning of settlement in Victoria, in
1834, the Were family arrived from England
and squatted on Port Phillip. Mrs. Shep-
pard, then a few years old, was one of the
Were children; and three of her brothers
survive her—Frank, Charles and gay old
Bonville. The old lady was the relict of the
late Sherbourne Sheppard, who ran his sheep
at Shepparton in the early days of Goulburn
A r alley settlement.
Mrs. de Jardin, the handsome widow of a
one-time French Consul for Victoria, who
voyaged hither early this year on a visit
to her only chick Sophie (wife of Donald
Mackinnon’s brother Kenneth), was to have
returned to France last month. But the
submarines have been too busy for comfort-
able travelling lately.
Mrs. Albert Miller has reason to hate
the deep blue sea. After waiting years for
a trip to England she chose the unfortunate
Arabia for her voyage, and was torpedoed
along with the rest. She had the family
diamonds with her—quite an imposing col-
lection—and they have gone into Davy
Jones’s jewel safe for ever. Mrs. Miller
was journeying over to see her grandson—
the child of her son Guy. He was born
after his father’s death on the battlefield.
A Melbourne lawyer who is not a member
of the V.R.C. was found perched in the
members’ stand at the last big Flemington
meeting. At the request of a steward he
produced a member’s ticket, but it belonged
to another man. The solemn wrath of the
committee then thundered round the mem-
ber who had apparently lent his pass; but
subsequently he was exonerated since he
was in khaki and camp and declared he had
no knowledge of the misuse of his property.
So the storm-centre shifted back to the
lawyer; and there it is likely to spend
itself.
Your Johanna pauses in her weekly pil-
grimage to upbraid Mrs. Rumor, the respon-
sible party. The Doolettes are still squat-
ting on Kerriesdale, and have not sold the
squattage to the Etheridges. Also, they are
not off to England—at least, not at the
moment.
Napoleon Boffard, our singing baron, has
found a way to help win the war. He is
too old to fight in person, so he has offered
his services to the Commonwealth as in-
structor in French for several hours every
week to any officers and men who desire to
learn. His offer has been accepted, and a
scheme is in preparation by Mrs. Foster,
wife of the Brigadier-General Foster who is
Chief of the General Staff and a great
authority on the siege of Jerusalem. Classes
will be held in the camps, and other French
residents (men and women) are offering to
help.
Walter Kirby gave his annual recital last
week and got a well-powdered audience, Gov-
ernment House folks sitting as usual in the
front seats. Olive Godwin sang some “But-
terfly” and “Cavalleria” in a gown of
black net that had been made under the
keen eye of Grace Palotta. She also carolled
two local compositions—“ The White Rose,”
by Mary Sadlier Foster, and “Dawn,” by
Nellie Cuddigan. Nellie is a protegee of the
Brigidine Convent at Mentone, and is well
on the road to local fame. Doris Madden
played. Two Kirby pupils, Arthur Wilson
and Will Gai'vie, both baritones, helped W.
H. Croker to receive the G.-G. couple. Dur-
ing the melodious show Walter was laden
with useful presents. There were three
boxes of cigars, a set of gold links, a box
of ties and a laurel wreath which I hope
to see on his large auburn head when he
does the Block. The little jewel box and
some flowers were handed to him by Lola
Buesst, and he was so glad that he kissed
the youngster, who turned and fled in horror
to her grandmother. The effusive tenor
gracefully rounded off the incident by sing-
ing “Explanation,” a kissing song by Cole-
ridge Taylor. Little Lola, by the way, is
the daughter of Aylmer Buesst, an Austra-
lian, who has just been appointed conductor
under Beecham, the pill knight, at Covent
Garden. He is a grandson of that fine
musician, the late Mrs. Pett.
Margery Grey, a slender young violinist,
has been seriously ill, and her doctor insists
on 12 months’ rest from all work.
The “Fritz Hart Con,” with Fritz waving
the baton and the Melba pupils doing the
chorus work, got through Gluck’s “Iphigenia
in Aulis” on Thursday night at the Play-
house, and then went home to rest for the
second performance on Saturday. The
orchestra was good and Fritz proudly
mopped his perspiring brow. The home-
made gowns looked graceful enough on the
girls, and the men sang so well that you
forgot their white flannelette nighties and
the tin belltopper of Achilles —in ordinary
life a bulletheaded young man named Les
Sanders. Agamemnon saved the situation.
Tom Minogue acted and sang the part
with vigor and intelligence. He is a black-
haired. flashing-eyed Irish-Australian of 25.
Ann Williams, who is teaching at the Con-
servatorium, looked startled and proud of
her pupils’ success. Gertrude Johnson played
Iphigenia in white and gold and very long
natural black hair-plaits, and Gertrude s
excited, delighted mother could scarcely sit
still. Pretty Strella Wilson looked on from
the wings. She was booked for the Greek
leading lady in the Saturday night show.
Strella has a sweet, lilting voice that is very
flexible.
Four bright Repertory Theatre girls,
Isabel and Kate Handley, Allie Robson and
Ethel Leon, are leaving for the U.S.A., and
have hopes of dropping into an aching void
for Australian talent on the neutral stage.
Mrs. Scott, the history Professor’s wife,
all smiles and blue fixings, unloaded a few
tons of literary pearls for flappers of both
sexes at the Shakspearian annual prize-
giving. Blushful young highbrows simply
staggered under the weight of their win-
nings and performers toiled through a long
programme. Mabel Seacombe sang in white
flounces and a wreath of roses so withered
that the horrified onlookers at first gasp
took them for curling-papers. Carrie Haase
attacked the duologue between Henry V. and
Queen Katharine with moderate success.
(What dreadful jobs these reciters set them-
selves !) Her dress, which suggested a
Swiss peasant, lent a sort of ragtime effect
to the turn. The John Hopkins pair scored
in an act from “Richard III.,” but Mrs.
John’s make-up was. ineffective. As Romeo
and Juliet Audrey Anderson and Grace
Groome just missed, mainly because the
deep-throated Lily Brayton-esque articula-
tion did not suggest unsophisticated sixteen.
Romeo was all right except for being a girl.
No recruiting-officer would have troubled
about him. John Amadio and his flute got
a round of applause that seemed to have a
ring of gratitude about it.
For her show at the Athenaeum Mrs.
Withers has been able to borrow some fine
water-colors and oils by her late artist-
husband which have not been exhibited
before. Daughter Margery is showing por-
traits, and her fiancg hangs some black-and-
white work, so it is quite a family gather-
ing. Margery’s blaek-and-whiter is Martin
Paterson, who was a student at the Mel-
bourne National Gallery schools before he
enlisted. Kitty Turner is represented by
metal work and hand-set jewellery. The
Creswell dame opened the show with some
knowledgeable talk. Mrs. William Irvine
and her sister, Mrs. Fisken, were among the
listeners. Others close handy were the General
Bridges widow and Captain and Mrs. Hugh
Tring. The show is to last a fortnight.
Until recent years afternoon-tea was a
middle-aged habit; but it grows younger
every day. The flapper is now a whale for the
dissipation, and her favorite college, boy
does the financing. But the other day I
struck the limit. He was px*obably 10, she
nine, and both were dressed to the juvenile
ultimate. He led her through the press,
deposited her at a table, ordered tea and
sandwiches, tipped the waitress, squared the
account, and went out, lighting a cigarette,
a perfect devil of a fellow.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

The “Swan-Safety” is simpler and more reliable than any
other pen made; may be carried in any position, in any pocket,
handbag, or trunk, without fear of leakage; with the “ladder”
feed, erratic working is out of the question; the nib is the
product of over 60 years’ experience; the holder is beautifully
balanced and holds a good supply of ink.

“Barcoo” : “Toby C.” (B. 19/10/T6) did
not exaggerate when he said that Strawberry’s new-
born is difficult to locate. Recently, when chasing
a couple of thousand cows from Normanton in the
Gulf to the N. S. Wales border, we had one or two
additions to the family every day. The cows were
always allowed plenty of space to lie down or feed
about, and when time came to move forward again
ma generally had Staggering Bob planted in the
luxuriant grass. She would invariably be where the
youngster was not. As the mob moved off she
would be allowed to go back, but would give little
indication as to where the offspring was hidden as
long as she thought she was being watched. The
searching stockman would have to keep well away
until the lad}' decided that she had been forgotten.
Then he could hop in and catch her attending to
the thirsty little one. With cattle at present prices
the drover gets a nice bonus on each calf saved, and
he always travels with a very large waggonette
capable of carrying up to 20 head. The driver of
the nursery is known as “Calvey.” After being
carted for about a week his charges manage to walk
without assistance.
NO FURTHER USE FOR THE
MEDICINE.
SMALL CHILD : “Mey feyther says
will ye no talk it bade fer a
shillin'? Hither's dead.”
“Lantana”: A team of nine recently made
the wool fly at Gulgo shed, near Forbes (N.S.W.).
Team’s total for the day, 1835 jumbucks. Highest
scorers: (I) A. Norton 254, (2) Joe Larkins 232, and
(3) Sam Gates 231. It is claimed as an Australian
record. Any complaints ?
“Merrigal”: Two more carrying achieve-
ments. Joe Hallam, with his greenhide and 42
workers, yoked four abreast to the “Hillston Pet,”
transferred at one passage 17 tons of scoured wool
dumped in 144 bales, ranged 27 on the bed and 31
on the top-rung, from Hillston to Carrathool Siding,
a matter of 70 miles. His remarks were well within
the rules, except when the cargo contacted with the
telegraph wires en route. The Buttabone team of
14 Suffolk Punches shifted a waggon with 100 packs
of greasy aboard, weighing 18 tons 6cwt., from the
press to Warren, 32 miles. So they oughter; their
old man cost 1000 guineas.
“Bill Badd” : A word with the complainants
in the M.L. orchardists and opossum case. Four
years ago I was filling in time between paydays on
the Reefton-Westport railway construction, then
about 12 miles out at the Westport end, and three
miles or so into the Buller Gorge, where ’p° ss - was an
established resident. The bitter wind that drives
down the gorge makes it one of the coldest spots in
the island for outdoor toilers, and the little Aus-
tralian with the rich man's rug at a poor man’s
price was a public benefactor. During the two years
I was there the ’poss. made no trek towards the
orchards 12 miles up the river, and the fruit-trees
on the other side were ignored, although the ferry
wires made a dead-easy track if hunger was the
spur. Judged by excellence of the fur the animals
were in splendid condition, and by the frequency of
females with a tenant in the pouch, the bush diet
was quiet congenial. Where this is the case cultiva-
tors needn’t worry. Some people would put a horse
in a cabbage-garden with a nearly-empty feed-box
and expect it to eat nothing but chaff.
* * * *
“S.E.S.” : Where Mitchell grass flourishes
a good deal of bush-haymaking is done. This grass
is as good for stable feeding as any other hay, and it
has been found sweet and fattening after being in
stack for 20 years. On some of the clear plains
mowing machines are used for cutting it, the work
and conditions then being similar to those on ordi-
nary harvesting fields. In some places the grass is
cut with scythes; or, where the growth is patchy,
with reaping-hooks. Mitchell grass is the only hay
stored at a great many of the central homesteads.
Seed from this grass is also collected as from blue
grass, Flinders grass and other valuable drought-
resisting native vegetables. Another growth that is
extensively cut, and the cutting of which provides a
lot of employment for the floating population, is
cane grass. This is the product of swampy plains, and
is used for thatching. It prevails on generally lumpy
ground, and is a favorite resort of snakes —like the
selection that our old friend Adam didn’t carefully
attend to.

One end of King O’Malley’s idea about
laying pipes under Torres Strait and bringing water
to the Northern Territory from Papua is all right:
the water is in Papua. At Kikori 72.58 inches of
rain were recorded for September, and though there
were only 35.89 inches at Nepa it rained every day
in the month there, while at Kikori they did have
two fine days. The six feet isn’t a world’s record
for a month, though it is pretty well up; they
have done better at Cherrapunji, in Assam, where
the year’s fall runs from 550 to 700 inches and
where they once had 36 inches in 24 hours. Cro-
manhurst, in the Blackall Ranges (Q.), had 30
inches in 24 hours; and that is about the best we
can do.
A DISTINCTION.
THE PASTOR (to abusive small girl ): “For shame, Hannah, to speak like that to any
old man!”
HANNAH: "'Im! ’E ain't a ’ old man. ’E’s on'y fader.”
“Pick”: In recent arguments concerning
preventives of rust and smut in wheat not a word
was written about the investigations by G. L. Sutton,
conducted at the Cowra (N.S.W.) Experiment Farm
in 1910. Sutton was delegated by the Agricultural
Department to discover a reliable fungicide. His
experiments included treatment with (1) solution of
formalin, (2) solution of bluestone, (3) bluestone
and limewater, (4) Bordeaux mixture, (5) bluestone
and saltwater, (6) common saltwater, and (7)
fungusine, a proprietary preparation. He awarded
fungusine the wreath. It proved a preven-
tive of bunt, non-injurious to the seed and
a protection against the attacks of unseen
grain pests. Bluestone, the specific most
favored in recent Abo. pars, when unmixed with some
ameliorating agent, though a good preventive, was
condemned, inasmuch as 30 per cent, of the grain
had its vitality reduced in the pickling. When
mixed with limewater the destructive effects of blue-
stone were lessened by 20 per cent., but the pre-
ventive agency was also lessened in equal ratio. The
other tried specifics were declared to be entirely
ineffective and unsuitable.

“Barcoo” : How is this for a world’s record
in wool-pressing ? A couple of weeks ago Frank
Stephens turned out 48 bales weighing 169 cwt. lqr.
121 b. at Manuka station, North Queensland, in eight
working hours and single-handed. The job was
certified to by Chappel, the manager of the shearing
contract.

“Bad Australian” (from Argentina) :
Just after mailing a par. in reply to “Moana” (B.
8/6/’l6) news arrived that a notorious bandido who
has been bossing the Far North for some years had
bumped it hard. Well armed and mounted, a good
shot and A 1 rider, he has several dozen killings to his
discredit. About a month ago, tiring of the monotony
of bush life, he, went into one of the smaller towns
to spend a week-end and see the latest pictures. He
hadn’t been long there when a bunch of officious John
Hops started sniping at him. This annoyed him a
little, so he unslung his Winchester and bored in.
Result, three dead Johns and another perforated.
Then he took horse and away, and was next heard of
two or three days ago at a township about 50 miles
from the scene of his last bag. He turned up at the
pub and store intending to settle an old account
with the two brothers who ran the place and had
rendered the police assistance to his detriment. But
these live boys saw him coming, and pulled their fine
new automatics and started punching him with nickel-
cased bullets. As he had determined that the call
should be something more than a mere formal show
of courtesy, he returned their polite attentions in a
manner suited to the occasion. After he had
delivered three most scrupulously correct replies to
their inquiries, the exchange of civilities ceased for
want of a quorum, the two commercial gentlemen
being dead and the freelance so overcome by the
warmth of his reception that he had fainted. Then
the police arrived and took over the cadavers and
plugged the bandido’s wounds with cotton waste and
wheelbarrowed him to the nearest hospital, Where
he now lives in hope of a glorious resurrection and
a return to the old game after about six months in
gaol. Homicide is regarded about as seriously in
these parts as pinching a pig in Australia. The free-
booter’s armament consisted of a Winchester carbine
and Colt revolver. He didn’t unlimber his heavy
ordnance in his last action, and the small arm still
contained three unexploded cartridges when over-
hauled. Of those which remained in his bandolier
the bullets had been carefully dum-dummed. “Kinder
wise guy that road-agent,” as my pal Woodenhammer
remarked on receipt of the news.
* * * *
“Wandi”: Binghi is an expert at taking
“sugarbags.” He does not mind stings; in fact, he
seldom gets stung. Yet he never cuts a tree down
or uses smoke, and nine times out of 10 hash’t a
particle of clothing on him. When he climbs a tree,
unless there are whites about, he leaves his clothes
on the ground. One day, while out shooting, I came
upon an old gin standing at the butt of a gum-tree,
holding a piece of bark about a foot square in her
hands, while several dogs sat on their haunches star-
gazing beside her. Her other half was a hundred
feet up the tree, extracting honey from a hole he
had cut in the side of a limb. As he dropped the
comb, piece by piece, the gin caught it dexterously
on the sheet of bark and passed it to the billycans.
The dogs relieved the monotony of the job by yelp-
ing and springing at the descending comb, some-
times catching it and sometimes sending it and the
bark and the gin spinning in different directions.
Then would follow a whirlwind of sticks, bedraggled
skirts, unkempt hair and vituperation, mingled with
a deep baritone snort of disgust from aloft.
* * * *
“Pick”: When snakes are on trek wide
stretches of water will not baulk them. On Corunna
Lake (N.S.W.) I once met a brown five-footer fully
a mile from land. The appearance of my canoe
scared him, and as he fled back towards his starting
point the rapid zigzags of his backwash proved that
his long swim hadn’t taken the go out of him. I
saw another specimen step ashore from the Pacific
Ocean. I dunno whether he had crossed from South
America or had merely been surfing. I treated him
as an undesirable immigrant and left it at that.

THE AVENGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We knew the tale the women told
Of Spence’s little wife
And Greer. They had been over-bold,
And we expected strife;
For yesterday afforded Spence
Grim circumstantial evidence.
This Geordie Spence was grim and strong,
A silent man and still.
We felt he was not one who long
Would brook a shameful ill.
Now gun in hand the man was here.
“Lan’lord,” he said, “I’ll have a beer.”
He drank as one who needed strength,
Then stood with drooping head.
He turned and looked at us at length,
And slapped his gun and said:
“That Greer’s no better than a hog.
I’m square with him — I’ve shot his dog!”

26 extra features in the 1917 MitcFldl
YOU will find in the Mitchell 1917
light model twenty-six valuable
extra features and many minor
improvements added to all the good
qualities which made the Mitchell Six
of nineteen-sixteen so favorably known.
Mitchell experts examined 257 of the
world’s finest cars, selected all the best
features, and combined them in this
Mitchell master model.
The Mitchell is now the most modern
and most complete fine car made. Only
the extreme efficiency of the Mitchell
factory and the large-quantity produc-
tion render the moderate price possible.
The essential things—comfort, endur-
ance, beauty, dependability—are all in
the Mitchell in the highest degree.
In addition, the Mitchell has every
convenience, every refinement, every
dainty touch that automobile experts
have yet conceived.
The engine is six-cylinder, high-speed
type, 3% bore, 5-inch stroke. It is
fitted with Simms unfailing magneto
ignition. It takes you twenty-five miles
and more to the gallon.
The extra-long 120-lnch wheelbase
gives you ample roominess. The 50-
inch Bate cantilever rear springs make
the Mitchell the easiest-riding car on
the road.
The Mitchell has labor-saving engine-
driven tyre-pump; quick-acting de-
mountable rims; electric lighting; self-
starter.
Five-passenger, £435.
Single-seater, £415.

Actress Tells Secret
A Well-known Actress Tells How She
Darkened Her Grey Hair with a
Simple Home-made Mixture.
Miss Blanche Rose, a well-known actress,
who darkened her grey hair with a simple
preparation which she mixed at home, in a
recent interview made the following state-
ment : “Any lady or gentleman can darken
their grey hair and make it soft and glossy
with this simple recipe, which they can mix
at home. To a half-pint of water add loz.
of bay rum and a small box of Orlex Com-
pound. These ingredients can be bought at
any chemist’s at very little cost. Apply to
the hair twice a week until it becomes, the
required shade. This will make a grey-
haired person look 20 years younger. It is
also fine to promote the growth of hair, and
relieves itching and dandruff.” — Advt. [1

“Bill Bedsox”: The Australian sheldrake,
or mountain duck, the largest and most handsome
of all our freshwater ducks, invariably nests in a
tree, when possible close to the water, in a fork
or hollow limb at a good height above the ground.
The residence is usually a capacious affair, for
at times mother Sheldrake has to stretch the family
THE TRAINING OF LITTLE ISAAC.

quilt over a dozen and a half of fluffy darlings.
For some considerable time I had speculated as to
the means adopted by the old birds for transporting
the ducklings from the nursery to their playground
in the reeds, as the youngsters are incapable of
flight for some time after leaving the nest, though
adepts at swimming and diving at a very early age.
Last season I solved my puzzle. I saw one mamma
aeroplaning her family in three equal batches of
four, descending each time in a long slant from
nest to water, with her passengers hanging on by
bill and toes to her breast-feathers. On reaching
the water the youngsters vanished among the reeds,
but presently reappeared at a call from the mother,
and swam sedately in her wake as she led them to
security under the overhanging casuarinas.
* * * *
“Moobita”: Any of your Abo-lyres ever
struck the wide-awake, a pretty little lepper which
inhabits the west side of lakes Eyre and Torrens?
He is the slickest jumper I know of. Kick a tussock
and you get a full view of the longest jump on
record; and if you can locate him after the third
bound you beat the band.
PLEASANT SUNDAY AFTERNOONS
AT MULGATOWN.
JACKY (excitably): “Git off! Git off! You
preak your plurry neck!”
HIS CHARCOAL TART (breathlessly):
“Can't! Me too plurry prightened!”
“Fait Lux” : If “Inver G.” really wishes
to preserve, his clobber from silverflsh and moths he
cannot do better than put them (the clobber, not the
fish and moths) in an unbleached calico bag. I have
used this method for years, and never known it
ineffective. A newspaper bag is also a Verdun while
the ink is fresh.
“J.G.”: “Tasman” (B. 2/11/T6) in his
list of different gate-hangings omits the style that is
the most used of all—that is, with hinges made of
fencing-wire. Hundreds of gates are hung with wire,
either single or twisted into several strands. “Tas-
man” says that with factory-made hinges there is
nothing to stop a bull from lifting a gate kite-high
and going through. This is so if the hinges are put
on with the spikes pointing upwards; but if one
spike to hold the shaft is turned downward there is
no bovine on hoofs that could shift the obstacle with-
out smashing it. The only objection to a gate fixed
thus is that it is the Devil’s own work to get it off
again should that become desirable.
* * * *
“Alamon”: As the Chows in the N.T.
are eager purchasers of kangaroo galls, I have been
turning an honest penny by drying and selling
them. But I have noticed lately that the gall of a
doe kangaroo, when she has a young, undeveloped
joey in her pouch, differs considerably from the
gall of the buck. The doe’s gall in such cases is
very scanty, the bag being almost white and the
skin of it fully four times as thick as usual.
Whaffor? John Chinaman reckons these galls are no
good, but refuses to give any reason.
* * * *
“Moobita”: “Norseman’s” lone- string of
camels is easily squelched. In the early ’Bo’s the
s.s. Bucephalus disgorged 400 of the ammoniated
beasts in Port Augusta. They were so
smellful that all nantos (horses) not
nailed down made a break through
Pitchi-Ritchi Pass, on to Ragless and
Kanyaka Plains, thence to unknown
addresses. I loaded 200 of the beasts
at H'ergott Springs, mostly for Birdsville
(Q.). Forty of them were, by the way,
lost in the bog at the Lower Cooper
crossing. The camel objects to rise in
mud owing to the danger of his behind
legs slipping laterally, thereby breaking
the hip-bones. Some were loaded with
Bft. sheets of galvanised-iron, which
looked like huge scimitars flashing in
the sunlight as Phaiz and Tarzh Mahomet led the
Titan army across the Frome.
“C.”: “Trafalgar’s” yarn (B. 9/11/’l6)
brings out my starter for the eel handicap: length,
7ft. 6in. ; girth, 16in. ; weight, 591 b.; taken out of
the Upper Merang Creek, S. Queensland, with the
aid of a .44 service rifle. At Christmas, 1910, this
creek was alive with similar specimens.
* * » *
“Try Fluke”: Maori kainga Rapaki, on
Lyttelton Harbor, has an interesting pakeha prayer-
house. It is an old-fashioned building about the
size of an ordinary dining-room, with porch and
belfry to match. A bell was bought, but as it waa
a size too large for the steeple the Ngati-Rapaki were
faced with the problem of whether to build a new
belfry or strafe the bell. The trouble was solved by
doing neither. A lordly big ribbonwood tree, the
Maori houhi, stands alongside the toy kirk and quite
overshadows it, and on the lowermost limb now hangs
the peace disturber, which a brown juvenile tangi-
tangis on such days as a stray parson can be yarded
for the karakia.
“Bex”: Touching the question of exter-
minating mallee, when are we going to have a shoot
scorcher that will fill the bill? There are thousands
of acres of mallee land in S. Aus. too stony to cul-
tivate, but if the scrub were killed it would become
good grazing country. Two or three attempts have
been made to introduce a scorcher, but so far nothing
has come to stay. Would a bonus help it along?
* * * ♦
“Axehandle”: “J.Z.R.” (B. 16/11/T6),
who says of Monaro sheep that some which look fat
and well promptly snuff out when
driven, has evidently struck what is
known locally as “black disease.” It
is peculiar to patches of the cold coun-
try, but by no means prevalent through-
out Monaro. A feature of the ailment is
that the fattest sheep are likeliest to
go under to it. There are no symptoms;
the smitten jumbuck just lies down in
his tracks and snuffs out without a
struggle, and in death has the appear-
ance of being asleep. I have skinned
scores of victims. The inside of the
pelt looks as though the owner had met
his death by being beaten with a stick,
as it has a bruised and blackened
appearance—hence the local name,
“black” disease. Travelling With a
mob of 4000 4-tooth crossbred ewes
from south Monaro to Gippsland, we
found the morning after taking delivery
300 dead on the camp, and for the
first week there was skinning to be
done each morning. Some owners claim
that if sheep are shifted to another pad-
dock as soon as the scourge shows itself
the losses will be few ; others make a quick muster
and truck the flock to Sydney for conversion into
prime mutton.
* '* * *
“Merrigal”: Pelicans’ nests, which are
always in the open and in colonies, are but shallow
dugouts, with nought to soften the sitdown except
a few flakes of the owners’ fluff shed therein. Bird-
men know little about these ground-dwellers, but are
certain that they are born blind and that their
fleshy pink epidermis is unrobed until they’re fairly
well grown. Some argue that there are three eggs
in a batch; I’m betting that there are only two.
Australia’s representative of the family is not only
one of the largest extant, but is distinguished from
all others by its feathered lores. To see them in
their glory spend Christmas around the islets in the
Coorong, between Wood’s Well and Salt Creek (S.A.).
Turn your smelling sense off at the meter in the
vicinity of their rookeries. They do chime! Per-
haps because they’re whales on prawns.
MIDNIGHT PHILOSOPHY.
“What (hie) time does the last train go?”
“Twelve o'clock, sir. It’s just gone!”
“Then I (hie) won’t wait for it!”
“Russ”: These days have big teams, too.
Last week I saw 45 horses drawing a load of wool
from Willandra through the flood-waters of the
Lachlan. They were five abreast, and the team
belonged to George Prentice. At the same time
“Snowy” Schneider had 38 horses, also five abreast,
at the same game. And he should have had five
more.
“Milo”: Don’t forget the petrol tin when
the list of useful bush makeshifts is being compiled.
Just outside Winton (Q.) I saw a spacious kitchen
whose walls were built of these cans. They were
filled with sand and set in cement like blocks of
stone. The walls defy any willy-willy, and other
virtues claimed for the building are that it is cool
in the summer and warm in the winter. Since
motor vehicles have become the chief agencies of
transport out west, hundreds of petrol billies are
strewn along every thoroughfare. The Blaekall town
council uses them to fill up washouts in the roads.
The tins are beaten flat and thrown into the aper-
ture, and sand and gravel gradually collect and are
consolidated.
* • • *
“Half-Moon”: When love calls to the
Cape York Binghi he votes “Yes” every time.
Recently two of these natives got away at night
from a pearling lugger about 30-odd miles from the
mainland. The skipper hoisted all sail at dawn
in pursuit and eventually sighted one of the
swimmers doing the last lap of the journey home-
wards and dead-heated with him on the beach. Asked
where was his mate, he jerked a thumb over his
shoulder and said, “He been drink water longa
road.” That was the whole obituary.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: One of the natural features
on the East-West railway 60 miles from Port
Augusta (S.A.) is a young half-caste aborigine of 12
years who, for a screw of 12 bob a day, is water-
joey to the gangs. His weight is 12st. 61b.,
and when he stands in the middle of the permanent-
way, with his arms folded on his lower chest, he is
a young buffer who could hardly be shifted by a
Baldwin engine.
FATAL FLESH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Pastor Parker, Seventh Day Adventist missionary
from Malekula in the New Hebrides, addressed a
meeting of trainees in Melbourne the other night.
He said that on one occasion, when he preached to the
big Nambus tribe, in the interior of the island, the
natives gathered round and felt his body. Another
pastor preached while the cooked body of a man was
being eaten.”
He preached of Christian tenderness.
The wily niggers, scenting fibs,
Each ventured on a shy caress,
Or slyly dug him in the ribs.
Whene’er a preacher in that part
Is plump and made of yielding stuff
The savage takes him to his heart
(Ah, well, dear friends, that’s near enough).
Here’s one too thin to roast, they say.
They set aside their purpose grim,
And let the pastor preach and pray,
Till they have better use for him.
To dodge a culinary fate,
And make the Nambus toe the line,
Trainees to Hebrides consigned
Are worked down wonderfully fine.
VICTORIA.

A Real Triumph Beyond
Doubt for
De Witt’s
Kidney & Bladder
Pills
Where is there a woman who has not heard it said that if a
man had to endure half the ailments, pains and anxieties that a
woman suffers from time to time he would die under the strain.
This very probably is true. Women, owing to the delicacy of their
organic construction, do suffer acutely, in some cases at intervals,
in other cases for the greater part of their lives.
While a good deal of this suffering in women is difficult to
account for, still a very great deal of it is simply and solely due to
weakened kidneys and bladder, both of which organs are subject
to greater strain and more liable to derangement in a woman than
in a man. Women, further, suffer considerably because, from an
altogether disproportionate amount of modesty, they prefer to
suffer in silence rather than to make their condition known to
others, even of their own sex, on such matters.
Sometimes their suffering becomes so acute that they are
driven to search diligently for something which will bring even
temporary relief. Fortunately many women use sound common-
sense and their own judgment in regard to the treatment of their
peculiar ailments.
“I suffered terribly with kidney and bladder weakness and
rheumatic pains for over ten years. The sufferings I went through
were a trial. I became very depressed and absolutely unfit for
anything, even my household duties. Knifelike pains seemed to
catch me in the back; at times they would come on so severe as to
make me quite helpless. I was really in a very bad state. I tried
anything and everything I heard of, different remedies and treat-
ments of all kinds, but nothing seemed to do me any good.
“I had heard a good deal about De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills and what a wonderful remedy they are for suffering woman-
kind, so I decided to get a box and give them a trial. The results
were most astonishing, gravel and sediment were brought away
after the first two doses, and I got Wonderful relief. I persevered
with the pills and I gradually got brighter and better day by day-
They completely cleared away the bladder pain and kidney trouble,
and the rheumatism that I had completely left meh This is now a
year and a half ago and I have not had the slightest twinge of
pain since. De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, in my case, have
proved a veritable godsend, for they have absolutely cured me.
Knowing how much good they have done me I have been able to
speak most highly of them, and am very pleased to be able to
recommend them to other women who suffer as I did.”
Mrs. Holt, the lady in question, who lives at 20 Windsor
Street, Nuneaton, was cured about Christmas, 1912, now over
three years ago. On April 18, 1916, she said, “I can gladly
confirm all that 1 have said previously about the wonderful
efficacy of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills. Not only did I
derive such prompt relief from them, but through letting other
like sufferers know, I have been the means of bringing relief to a
great many women who suffered as I did. They worked a splendid
cure in my case and I shall always gladly recommend them
wherever I go. My health continues to be very good.”
Another lady living quite near to Mrs. Holt was similarly
afflicted. At No. 23, Victoria Street, Nuneaton, lives Mrs. Wykes,
who was suffering in a similar way to Mrs. Holt. “For over
eleven years,” says Mrs. Wykes, “I suffered with terrible kidney
trouble and most acute backache pains. At various times through
The suffering and
misery of worn-out,
weary women banished
and life made joyous.
Mrs. WYKES (from photo).
De Witt’s proved a veri*
table godsend. They
absolutely cured me.
this long period of suffering I have been in a very bad condition,
pains striking me across the back and loins; to stoop was torture
and every action was a trouble. It was just as if a vise had got
hold of me and was screwing me up. I tried many remedies, first
one and then another recommending me to different things, but
nothing seemed to touch my case. During the early part of 1913
I heard of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and I determined
to give them a trial. I am thankful I did, because I seemed to
gain relief after the very first dose. I got another 2/9 bottle from
Mr. Baker’s shop in Abbey Street, and felt much better; I got
brighter and more active and in fact felt a different woman. _ I
intended to make a good cure of my case seeing that I was getting
so much relief, - and I am pleased to say that I have done so,
because for the past 12 months I have been absolutely clear of my
old complaint and have not had the slightest trace of any kind of
backache.”
Nearly three years afterwards —April, 1916 —Mrs. Wykes
said, ‘‘De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills did me permanent good,
there is not the slightest doubt about that; I always recommend
them with a strong feeling of gratitude for what they have done
for me.”
Here is the testimony of two women who have known, each
a different kind of case, but in both cases the same organs—
weakened kidneys—were at the bottom of it.
Many people have kidney trouble and do not know it, and
would be glad to know how they could recognise whether they
really have any form of kidney trouble. Here are the ways to tell:
Have you a nasty taste in your mouth the first thing in the
morning, puffiness under the eyes, general feeling of weakness and
irritability, aches and pains in various parts of the body, have
you constipation, cloudy urine, or sharp stabbing or aching pains
—q pain “as though my back will break?” These are the sure
and certain symptoms of kidney trouble, and those who suffer from
backache, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, cystitis (inflamma-
tion of the bladder) or pains in the muscles and joints are all
suffering these pains through weak or diseased kidneys, for these
are positively the symptoms of kidney trouble.
Suffering men and women should always bear in mind that
to cure any kind of kidney or bladder trouble you must positively
make sure that your remedy does really touch the kidneys and
bladder. Whatever remedy you use must pass right through the
kidneys and bladder, and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine changes to a muddy bluish color
—a feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all other kinds —jou know, beyond all doubt, that they
have put their healing touch on the right spot —the kidneys and
the bladder. These wonderful pills, going straight to the kidneys,
give such amazingly quick relief every time. They are gentle and
yet penetrating, searching yet soothing, and a permanent cure
follows in almost every case. You can understand that when a
proved remedy, such as De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, have
penetrated right into every crevice of the kidneys and bladder,
carrying their healing properties with them. It is only common
sense to believe you will get just the same benefit as did Mrs. Holt
and Mrs. Wykes if you give them a fair trial.

runs them on the lines of utter respectability
no doubt it does a public service. The past
year’s receipts showed a small shrinkage; on
the other hand, taxation took a bigger bite,
and the result is shown in the smaller net
profit. Besides paying a steadily-increasing
dividend this progress has been made in the

some depreciation of premises to set against
it. But it isn’t likely to amount to much.

“Colander”: Out of 28 State enterprises
the Vic. Auditor-General reports to Parlia-
ment that seven returned small profits and
21 yielded dead losses last year. Yet it is
announced (B. 23/11/’l6) that geologist
Herman and the New Industries Commis-
sion think of nationalising the brown coal
industry. There are over 2000 sq. miles
of proved brown coal in Victoria, and
nearly all of it belongs to private owners
who bought the land and got Crown
grants prior to March, 1892, when
an Act was passed reserving the brown coal
under all land alienated after that date.
Unless Herman and co. suggest legislation
to confiscate all the privately-owned land
bearing brown coal, they have as much
chance of nationalising this mineral as they
have of nationalising air, fire, wind, baldness,
love-making and drinking. The Mines
Department proposes to spend £200(3 in ex-
perimenting on brown coal during this year,
and already it has a new laboratory where
a chemist messes about with a test tube
looking for tarry things that chemists of
continental Europe have known for 50 years.
What a farce! The Vic. Government has
messed up railways, roads, irrigation, coal,
closer settlement and beet sugar, and now
wants something else.

H. C. Hoover finds that the chairmanship
of the Belgium Relief Commission and a
couple of side-lines take up too much of his
time, so he has retired from the Lake View
and Oroya Board. His place has been
filled by J. A. Agnew, a Maorilander who
was underground boss at the Sons of
Gwalia when Hoover was manager. They
filled similar positions on a eoafimine in
Korea over which Hoover had a rumpus
with the Chinese authorities. About the
time Hoover parted company with 8.,‘ M.
& Co., Agnew became general manager in
Westralia for that firm. He fell out with
them about three years ago and joined
Hoover and Govett in London.

Bullrush’s Royal Standard Mine (W.A.),
working on 355. ore, is at a standstill for
want of men at the money offered. The
mill can’t get up to more than half-capacity,
and development work has ceased. So Shell-
cross has stabled the show, and proposes to
raise £7OOO cash to enable reserves to be
opened out. He has about as much chance
of success, unless a mining boom strikes
Westralia, as he has of seeing little Hig-
gins go for the nationalisation of the new
Australian smelting monopoly which he
and his pupil Hughes have created.
* * * *
Delay in starting work by the Langi
Logan Central arises from the absence of
necessary preliminary boring. The Board
is right. To get on to gold in a big gutter
is expensive, and there is not sufficient in-
ducement in the New Langi Central to bring
in calls. So the little money in hand is
more likely to be used to shove a quartz
mine on to the shareholders than in chasing
nuggets in prehistoric river beds.

Wolfram is distributed all over Australia,
but the five States are producing less than
700 tons a year. The find at Hatches Creek
(N.T.) is accessible from N.W. Queensland.
The distance from the Duchess railway, in
the Cloncurry district, is roughly 350 miles.
As at other wolfram camps the metal is
patchy. Queensland is leading as a pro-
ducer, but N. S. Wales is making headway,
and low-grade deposits at Yetholme
(Bathurst) and Wymah (Albury) are to be
equipped by Victorian capitalists. Wymah
wants to build a mill capable of treating
200 tons per week. Assays are good; but
it is very difficult indeed to average values
in a wolfram deposit. At Block 14 Tor-
rington (N.S.W.) the mill is doing the
averaging, and the extraction is often below
4 p.c. per ton of crude ore.
* * * *
Lake View and Oroya’s technical com-
mittee says a few words in the annual
report about the co.’s Westralian gold-
mining interests: —
Lake View and Star: Mine has been badly affected
by war conditions in combination with a run of low
stope values. Rise in cost of supplies, shortage
and inefficiency of labor and inability to obtain
the German manufactured cyanogen have in the
aggregate added greatly to working costs and in-
-creased the loss of gold in the residues. A method
of treatment without bromo-salts which was evolved
to meet the altered conditions has not so far given
as good results as those obtained under the old
system.
Queen of the Hills: Treatment has ceased owing
to failure to find ore in depth. The mine is under
exemption.
Yuanmi: Recent development has shown an
increase in tonnage and value of ore reserves and if
that now in progress below No. 6 level proves satis-
factory consideration will be given to increasing
the plant capacity sufficient to enable a reduction of
10s. to 12s. being made in working costs. The ore
exposed in the Warriedar option failed to realise
the value placed on it, and as treatment difficulties
arose the option was abandoned.
The Inky Way
“Hassan” : “Mr. James” is getting gay. In
his respectable family paper the other morn-
ing there was a picture of a buxom young
lady in a corset and little else. The legend
ran : “Cut open a So-and-So corset! What do
you find?” Mr. James, Mr. James!
* * * *
While at the height of his frothy English
boom W. M. Hughes did not get as much
space in the London papers as he had during
the first week of October, when the Sunday
Hebald was publishing half-page advertise-
ments in its reptile contemporaries, to boom
a series of articles, “Britain in the War, and
After,” written for the Hebald by the windy
little Welshman. The Sunday Hebald
claims a circulation of 2,000,000, but is of no
political or journalistic importance. Its
deadly rival, the Sunday Pictobial, recently
induced Winston Churchill to contribute four
short articles, for which it is alleged to have
paid him £lOOO, so the Hebald replied with
Hughes, who is said to have been paid a
fabulous price, too.
* * * *
Little Denmark is the place for ambitious
pressmen; not once or twice in its
rough Viking story the Inky Way has been
the path to glory. Six of the eight members
of the present Danish Cabinet are spillers
of ink and spoilers of copy paper, and the
other two are connected with journalism on
the business side. Most of the team were
recruited from Politiken, an outspoken
Radical sheet, founded over 30 yearsi ago W
Viggo Horup, the famous Radical ieader, ana
noted for its high literary standard (
Brandes contributes a weekly causer ) an
its habit of waxing frivolous anent matters
which right-thinking burghers regard
solemnly. Premier Zahle was at one Jim
its editor; Scavenius, the
was a regular contributor, and the Ministers
for Agriculture, War, Finance and Public
Worship were on the staff. *
“F AO”- Pressmen get more kicks than
W. S M. Hughes. Both Watson
and Fisher gave newspaper men
attention, but little puffing Bdly scoots
about like a fractious comet, with a clutch
ing bunch of pressmen for a tail. Up oo
lins-street, around Treasury ( | ar dens,
"bovs” must chivvy him, and all t e J ot e “
get is an impatient, “Eh, eh! What's that?
Wish we could leave the talking rockepalo
for a week and see what would happen .
Some press tickets for the recent Mayora
shivoo at Melbourne Town Ilalh at wl icli
Billy was the star, were marked 9.30 P- m -
Not select enough for the soup, the penrn
on the job were considered class enough to
dish up the tripe.
“Inver G.” : The Censor wouldn’t let
us say anything about it at the time,
but now that it’s all over the dread secret
may be told. One night very late 1 was
“subbing” on a Sydney morning papei
when a stranger came in, dropped something
on the table and walked off without saying
a word. I glanced wearily at the thing he
had left, and found it was an envelope
with the address in capital letters. Inside
was a small slip of paper with a hand-printed
message inside a thick black border. 1
suppressed the usual yawn and read :
YOU
YOU AND PAPER WILL BE BLOW
UP BY THE WORKERS OF NSW
IF ANEY MORE CONSCRIPTION PUT
IN YOU PAPERS.
Well, we had a good lot of conscription ready
for that morning, and, as I wasn’t going to
be there the next night. I took a chance and
let it go. When I turned up for duty the
beastly old office was still there. Nothing
entertaining ever happens to me.
* * ■ * *
“Hassan”: One of the emergency petrol-
engines which brought out an afternoon
paper during the coal-strike played fan-
tasies outside the reporters’ room and filled
it with foul fumes. The remarks of the
infuriated reporters are pasted on the win-
dow-pane. The best is a quotation :
Can Hell itself, with all its power to damn,
Add but one curse to the foul thing I am?
*. * * *
Died at Maryborough recently, Constant
Foret, better known as “Passe Partout,”
promoter of the intercolonial band concert
held in Sydney in 1896 and founder of The
Bandsman newspaper, the first of its kind
in Australia. For a great many years he
was a pedlar, and claimed that he had
walked 50,000 miles through Queensland and
N. S. Wales. He was born in France 55
years ago.

Consider the country and suburban news
rag how it sprouts. Australia supports 635
of them. The Nark State has 24 suburban
and 241 provincial; Victoria, 37 and 124;
Bananaland, 103 ; South Oss, 43 ; Westralia,
54; and the Northern Territory, one.
THE CLARION CALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“C. J. Dennis, father of the Sentimental Bloke,
Doreen and Ginger Mick, is leaving his political
secretaryship and making hack to his bush home
at Toolangi (Vic.), where the splitters live and a
writer has time to think.”
Wot price ole C. J. Den ? ’E’s done a break —
’E’s drawn ’is time and cut the Guv’ment stroke;
’E’s givin’ art a chance for art’s sweet sake;
’E alwis was a Sentimental Bloke.
Just fancy ’im a bloomin’ bureaucrat!
Blimey, I knoo ’e wasn’t meant for that.
All singin’ soldiers wot ’ave sung ’is songs,
Because of Mick, will ’elp ’is songs endure;
And ev’ry rhymester for ’is fame ’oo longs
Will wish ’im luck, pursuin’ lit’rachoor,
Though Billy ’Ughes will miss ’im at ’is post,
When fate ’as robbed Ted Russell of ’is “ghost.”
Ah, well —life’s but a thing o’ circumstance,
A sort o’ pendulum that comes an’ goes ;
But square an’ all, I ’ope we ’ave the chance
To meet once more Doreen, the Bloke an’ Rose
An’ Mick, ’oose friendship made their life’s brief
span
The richer for a gallant gentleman.
I ’ear some fat’ead murmur, “Rollin’ stone” ;
“Stick to your job,” observes some other chump;
But Den is bound to think things out alone,
Up at Toolangi, sittin’ on a stump,
An’ writin’ dinkum lyrics on the sly
For illustration by ’is pal, ’AI Gye.
I wisht I ’ad ’is luck —an’ so do scores
Of blokes wot keep their grindstones on the turn,
An’ kids in boots an’ socks, an’ wolves from doors —
It ain’t all po’try makin’ ’ome-lights burn.
But ar! ’is ’ome in dreamland ’olds a queen
To ’oom we dips our lid—’er name’s Doreen!
VICTORIA.

Vacuum System
Can Your Car
Do This?
Under its own power this car climbed this open jack-
knife bridge at the angle shown in this pi&ure.
This feat was made possible only by the Stewart
Vacuum System.
A car without one could not do it.
Every car so equipped is absolutely sure of a perfect
and positive flow of petrol to the carburetter under
all conditions and on any grade.
With the old gravity system of petrol feed, your car is
dead whenever your carburetter is higher than your
petrol tank.
The pressure system requires endless, troublesome
hand-pumping —keeping air leaks out of the lines,
and often, when most required, it fails.
You need power to climb a steep hill —but you need
more than power —you need a sure, even flow of
petrol to your carburetter at all times.
A Stewart Vacuum System insures this.
It also saves 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, on petrol bills.
It is used by over 60 per cent, of all car manufacturers
as standard equipment.
It can be installed on your present car (any make or
model).
PRICE £3 151- complete.
Bear in mind in selecting your next car to
see that it is fully equipped with Stewart pro-
ducts / most cars are, and it costs nothing
extra. See that it has a Stewart Tyre Pump,
Stewart Speedometer, Stewart Warning Signal
and Stewart Vacuum System.

POLITICAL
POINTS
HARD LUCK.
BILL (questioned by sympathetic strangers):
“Yes, I was under fire of shrapnel and
big guns and every kind of shells you
could think of, and then I only copped
just an ordinary rifle bullet.”
In 1901 the annual interest bill on Aus-
tralian State debts totalled £2,298,903; in
15 years the spendthrifts have borrowed so
lavishlv that to-day the bill runs to
£6,000,000 odd, and that is exclusive of
Commonwealth war borrowings of over
£100,000,000. How would it do to take a
referendum as to whether we shall honor our
promise to pay? And what would happen
if the Noes won?
Melbourne has a No Conscription Fellow-
ship ; and one of its speakers urges that “Mr.
Hughes should recruit the million voters
who had voted ‘Yes.’ ” But as the other mil-
lion said that voluntary enlistment would
answer all purposes, it is first up to them
to prove that it is. If it isn’t—if, after
careful trial, that million are proved by
results to be mistaken—there will be no
reason in the world why Parliament
shouldn’t still introduce compulsory service,
the same as it did in Britain. That refer-
endum didn’t answer the question eternally.
It only answered it until the No Conscrip-
tionists have had their chance to make good.
From Federal Treasurer Poynton’s story:
Our sinking funds are not held for the redemption
of our loans, but have always been used for subscrib-
ing to fresh loans.
Which means that the Commonwealth sink-
ing funds are worth about tuppence. So,
of course, are those of N. S. Wales. The State
debt at the end of June was £135,180,185;
the sinking funds amounted to £439,612.
The practice of borrowing a million and then
spending 2d. on something else, and getting a
receipt for the 2d. in case the lender of the
million should rush round for a settlement,
is a precaution that no one can afford to
miss.
Ball, N. S. Wales Minister for Works,
told a country deputation the other day
that money was desperately short and he
could offer them no hope that they would
be able to get a railway to carry their pro-
ducts to market. At the very time when
Ball was weeping crocodile tears over the
country producer he was spending thousands
of pounds in a Sydney suburb on merry-go-
rounds and razzle-dazzles and such play-
things. While that sort of war-time
economy goes on the pose of this Govern-
ment as a friend of the country producer is
shameless hypocrisy.
Is there any stupidity of which we are
incapable? Frank Tudor has just brought
under notice in the Reps, the latest piece of
insanity. When the home service proclama-
tion was revoked, 70 men with venereal
disease were released from the Langwarrin
Detention Camp. Owing to the absence of
regulations to the contrary, the military
authorities no longer had control of these
men, and they were at liberty to return to
their civil occupations and undergo any—
or no—medical treatment. Apparently, in
the opinion of negligent authority, syphilisa-
tion and civilisation are synonymous terms.
This mad system of having a so-called
National Government which builds strategic
lines through territory over whifch other Gov-
ernments have sovereign rights is producing
the inevitable anomalies. The National
Government, thinking to do that absurd
thing called saving money, wants to
make a dam near Kalgoorlie to hold
surface water for the East-and-West rail-
way engines. But the Westralian Gov-
ernment has a water-reticulation system
thereabouts, and it coolly announces that,
if the National Government catches water
for itself at Kalgoorlie, it will have
to pay through the nose somewhere else
where it caifit catch water. When will the
people get tired of this sort of thing and
demand unification?
Misguided they are, of course, and all that;
but how the enthusiasm of these I.W.W.
people shames Liberals and Laborites! The
Law has nabbed the chief of its leaders
and speakers, but their places have been
taken by others. Costs reaching four figures
have been incurred in the defence of various
members, and the money is being found by
the mostly-poor members. The confiscation
of books and machinery threatened the ex-
tinction of Direct Action, but except for
one week the paper has come out regularly
and new machinery is being secured. In
spite of a whole avalanche of troubles, in
fact, the organisation is at its old stand, and
it has undertaken to provide for the de-
pendants of the members who are gaoled.
The N.S.W. Liberals are restraining their
indignation like ladies and gentlemen. Last
week C. G. Wade took a fond farewell of his
greatness and commended his faithful fol-
lowers to the Labor devil in a few words:—-
I have enjoyed the confidence of the Liberal party
almost unimpaired for the past nine years, and I
owe much more indeed than I can express in words
to the fidelity of the members. I can only ask now
that they will transfer their generous support to
the new Government, and become active members of
the new party.
It makes some of the Most Expensive people
feel as if they had been sold by a retreating
landlady as part of a going concern.
Gus. Miller, the “Monaro foghorn,” was
an early victim to the N. S. Wales Parlia-
mentary upheaval. A few weeks ago he
was as snug as a weevil in a Cheddar in
his job of chairman of the Public Works
Committee. Then came the October revolu-
tion and the subsequent party revenges, and
Miller was guillotined. His head was at
the very bottom of the basket after the vote
for Holman’s new committee had been taken.
The Federal arithmetic seems to have got
tangled over the tax on amusement tickets.
In September Higgs reckoned he would get
£1,000,000 in six months. Poynton figures
on no more than £700,000 in a year. The
only difference between the two proposals
is that Higes was going to demand on
every 3d. ticket, and Poynton contemplates
letting the tray go untouched. Unless the
estimated monthly waste by the Defence
Department fell into the sum, it would look
as if somebody told Higgs he was going to
collect 1,716,384 ha’pennies every evening.
Justice Pring having made some very fierce
remarks about the I.W.W. and recommended
that “strong and drastic steps” be taken to
root it out, the Holman Government has pro-
ceeded to frame some new regulations which
is to say, some new crimes. But that isn t
enough. The truth is that the multitudinous
Governments in the country have by their
cowardly tolerance of criminality and law-
breaking as an instrument of political con-
troversy given direct encouragement to
the spread of the doctrines' _of the
anarchist, and by their gross failures in
administration and legislation have fostered
conditions in which the evil seed has
germinated. The “rooting up” of the
1.W.W., so far as its activities extend
to the counsel of arson and the distribution
of a demented literature, is an easy business.
But eradication of the ideas that are the
foundation of this brotherhood’s existence
is another proposition, and it is only the
foolish man who imagines that this is going
to be done by John Hops.
EXPERIENCED.
FIRST THEATRE MANAGER: “Heard the latest? Old Digby is running a comic opera!”
SECOND Do.: “ Digby? What on earth does he know about comic opera?”
FIRT T.M. : “Well, he was secretary to a Premier for three years.”
N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly established a
new record last week by sitting continu-
ously for 83 hours—from Monday to Thurs-
day. The previous best was in the days of
Parkes, when Freetrade was the daily bone.
This time the estimates were supposed to be
under discussion, and the talk ranged from
Beersheba unto Dan, and was usually
addressed to an empty Assembly. When the
orator of the moment felt his jaw giving
way he despatched a messenger to wake up
a reinforcement, who staggered in sleepily
on bare feet. This, of course, is the only
way in which the expenditure of public
funds can be properly criticised. The end
of it all was that when the crowd had got
tired to death the estimates went through
at a gallop. It recalls an old incident in
Maoriland. Seddon sat at the committee
table with the Government estimates. Seven
of his followers were sound asleep on the
benches. Time, 4 a.m. The last of the
stonewallers had bden carried out in a state
of collapse, and for a moment the House
would have been silent as the tomb if it had
not been full of loud snores. Then the old
man brushed away the cobwebs that had
been hanging round his eyes for three days
and nights, and, waking up the chairman,
moved that the items which everyone had
forgotten, and no one had spoken about, be
passed. The chairman mumbled something
—and the expenditure of £4,762,943 18s. 2d.
was agreed to in ssec. All the talk had
been about £1 13s. 6d. for a new window.
The Holman Government is, of course,
going to economise, like every other new
Government, and an order has been made
that all departments are to revise their esti-
mates. A preliminary cut of at least 10 per
cent, is to be made, and then the Government
will deal with the list as circumstances dic-
tate. This would be all right but for the
fact that the estimates are for the 12 months
which commenced on July 1. For five
months the departments have gaily expended
one-twelfth of their unreduced estimates
each month, so that the whole saving for the
year must be compressed into seven months.
No sane politician would run his private
business on such lines; but the ridiculous
method is reckoned quite good enough for the
public’s business. The public isn’t supposed
to be sane. As a matter of fact, at present
it isn’t.
During the record discussion on the esti-
mates in the N.S.W. Assembly last week
the party system got another fine advt. The
upkeep of Nielsen’s office in the U.S.A. was
under consideration. For years Nielsen and
his appointment had been attacked with the
biggest guns of the Liberals, and once the
£4 4s. per day drummer was the subject
of a motion of censure by the Libs, which
was only defeated by the Labs, sinking
everything except party. Then the Gov-
ernment became mostly Liberal, and
official Labor in opposition was out shoot-
ing. Suddenly the erstwhile Liberals
rushed in to the defence of what they
had a little while before stigmatised as the
biggest political job the country has known,
while Labor saw nothing but shame in what
it had previously staked its existence upon.
THE FIREWORKS OF LIBERTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
President Wilson officially lighted the statue of
Liberty, which henceforth will be illuminated nightly.
Of old sat Freedom on the heights,
Her splendid eyes a beacon clear
Through rayless deeps and starless nights
When tyrants held the sword and spear.
Men gazed upon her from afar,
And caught the purpose in her glance,
Till like a red and glowing star
She stalked above the fields of France,
Till with red stains on her white foot
Fearless she stood, by force a queen,
And, ’mid drum-beat and song of flute,
Peace crowned her with the olive green.
Then all men worshipped at her shrine,
Or said they did when talk ran high;
And after wars of beef and wine
On soaring words they bade her fly.
Then came the challenge. Earth awoke
To find the throne of Truth beset;
And where the guns in thunder spoae
Freedom and Death again were met.
Some ran to aid her ; some refrained ;
And some, in eager league with shame,
Gathered the ready gold that rained
Behind the ruin and the flame.
The form of Freedom standing high
Was there for greedy souls to mark,
Till one observed with wondering eye
Her giant effigy grown dark.
Ho! Galvanise the corpse again !
Bring globe and wire; she must not die!
Though France or Belgium be slain,
Light Freedom’s wide electric eyel
A Wilson to the rescue flies!
His notes are strong by land and sea.
His high commercial enterprise
Lights the dark shape of Liberty!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The N. S. Wales Totalisator Bill has
materialised in the form forecasted —7 per cent, for
the Government and 3 per cent, for the clubs,
which are to spend 2 per cent, on races and hand over-
-1 per cent, to liquidate the cost Of putting up tote
buildings. The Bill will do MacShortodds no
grievous injury—and as long as the division of the
rake-off is on the 7 and 3 basis, and the pro-
prietary clubs have a cut, it never will. Take any one
of these cluibs. It can easily get £ 500 from the collec-
tive Ikes for a day’s racing—perhaps more. To get
£5OO from the tote the machine would have to re-
ceive £25,000, and after paying for the handling of
this amount the club would get less than £5OO. What
chance is there of £25,000 coming in to the tote from
a Saturday-afternoon crowd or on an off-day among
the ponies or trotters, with Ike doing business on
the old familiar box ? Buckley’s—easy! The only
proper thing to do has not been done —to wipe
out the fielder altogether, to make the proprietary
racing club get out of business and turn the ratio
of the percentages the other way round. Public
revenue derived by the method proposed will be
dearly bought. With the totalisator there is no
justification for Israel. The whole case for the
machine rests upon Ike becoming a toiler.
According to a member of the N. S. Wales
Ministry about £5,000,000 is likely to be handled
at the totalisator. Heaven knows what he bases
his figures on, but evidently he reckons that the
books will be turning over more than an occasional
dollar. In Maoriland, where the books do not pub-
licly operate, the machine investments run into
£4,000,000. Well, if £5,000,0'0’0 is put into the
machine in N. S. Wales the State revenue at 7 per
cent, will be £350,000, the clubs at 2 per cent,
will get £lOO,OOO, and 1 per cent., equal to
£50,000, will go to extinguish the cost of tote
buildings and installation. In Maoriland out of the
£4,000,000 the State collects about £120,000, and
£280,000 goes to provide the cash that is raced for
and to maintain the courses. As there is about
four times as much racing in N. S. Wales as in
Maoriland, and stakes for the best class of horse are
very considerably' higher, the introduction of the
machine into N.‘S. Wales is being perpetrated on a
basis of making the race business continue to
depend upon the co-operation of Ike instead of upon
the direct co-operation of the public and the clubs
through the mechanical odds-merchant. What sort
of “reform” is that? No one ever asked for a joke
like this. No one who had even the least glimmer-
ing of what was being asked for ever supposed that
the argument hinged on the advantages of Ike plus
the tote. The whole thing turned on the propriety
of installing the tote minus Ike. It is now proposed
to bring the machine into the game, on a basis for
which (1) no argument has been advanced, and (2)
which disregards every argument put forward ir
favor of the adoption of the machine. It is a
cunning scheme to dig Ike in.

James, N. S. Wales Minister for Educa-

Bill. Presumably he will also bring out a few
simple betting tables for the schools.

The course of the Wilson Government’s
Bill to suppress the bookmaker, purify horseracing
and, incidentally, bring coin to a Treasury which is
as hollow as a drum, has added to the gaiety of
Westralia. Moses was to be summarily wiped off
the earth and street betting was to be a crime only
a little short of murder. No objection was raised
to the squelching of the pavement-spitting nuisances
that blot and spot St. George’s Terrace, but the
clubs, particularly the W.A. Turf Club, pointed out
that their Christmas programmes had been arranged
the old basis, and that it would be impossible to
provide adequate tote accommodation if Moses’s busi-
ess was deflected to the machine. The Government
lent a sympathetic ear and agreed to spare the life
of Moses Sbortodds until after Christmas. Then the
Leg. Council took a hand, and Wilson’s Bill has been
returned to him with the bookmaker a legalised insti-
tution and shorn of the provision by which the police
were empowered to arrest a street, bookie without a
warrant. The scream of the joke is that hitherto
the Law has said distinctlv that the bookmaker, on
and off the racecourse, was an illegal institution.
He existed by the forbearance of the authorities, while
now, if the Council’s say-so goes, Moses will ply a
protected trade as the result of a Bill that was
introduced allegedly to wholly suppress him.

The December Handicap at Moorefield
(Sydney) on Saturday induced a few nags engaged
in the Summer Cup and Tattersall’s Cup to have a
gallop. The winner turned up in First Lesson (7st.
111 b.), but Common Law (*Bst. 21b.) was doing best
at the finish. First Lesson, who let his supporters
down at Rosehill a day or two before, has 7st. 21b.
and 7st. 41b. in the Cups; Common Law, 7st. 81b.
There was plenty of money for him on Saturday at
3’s. But there was more for Blazing Hot. That
animal started at, 2’s, and finished at the wrong end
of the procesh.

Nancy Sykes, by The Welkin (imp.)
from Mrs. Peggott.v, also from the Old Dart, won
her first race on Saturday at Moorefield (Sydney),
after vainly trying at Randwick, Caulfield and Flem-
ington in richer events. Nancy was early in front
and led for the remainder of the 44 furlongs. Among
the cloud of runners three were picked out as
having chances, and they filled the places. The
favorite, Bundarra, turned for home alongside Nancy
Sykes, but could not hold her in the burst down
the straight. Brolly was again third, a position she
has occupied on several occasions. Nancy Sykes is
trained by Kelso, who had not had a winner on
metropolitan courses for a long time.
As compact a little horse as can be seen
in Sydney is Wedding Day, who slipped away
with ‘ Moorefield (Sydney) Flying Handicap
on Saturday, when the betting indicated that
such a thing was not expected. She had only 31b.
above the minimum, a fact which shows she has not
been doing anything like as well as she promised
when a year younger. Among the beaten lot was
Dame Acre, from Booth’s stable, and a red-hot fav-
orite. Luta.ua. was also there and the writer knows that
the stable thought so little about her chances that it
only risked £ 400. Lutana was absolutely last; but,
then, she received a bump when near th? front early
in the piece. The knock doubtless took the fight out
of her.

The Bulletin commented last week upon
the form shown by the Positano nag Flamboyant at
associated Sydney Pony Club meetings. When the
par. was penned Flamboyant had won two events
in succession. Since then he has added a similar
number to the list in as many starts. Four vic-
tories without a break in any company is out of the
ordinary, but Flamboyant’s performance in good class
is: better still. On Saturday he and Wherry ran a
dead heat in Victoria Park Handicap. Wherry’s
people had a deaf ear when a division of the spoil
was mentioned, but later were Sony for themselves.
They had bumped up against the best-conditioned
neddy racing on Sydney' tracks to-day, which is say-
ing something. Because her people ordered the run-
off Wherry was made fayorite. But she was a couple
of lengths astern at the end.

Despite troubles of war, A.J.C. entries for
the minor events at the summer meetings show a rise
—436 against 422 in 1915. Except a few entrants
from Bananaland, all are Ma State horses. But there
is a slump in Westralia. General entries for a four-
day Christmas meeting there total 550, or 160 less
than in 1915. The borrowing industry is having a
hard time over yonder, and gold, on which the State
depends largely, is the one thing you simply can’t
get war prices for.
Melbourne pony-racing is in _ good nick.
Last week’s meeting at Richmond ran into 17 events
before darkness came o’er the land. But Ascot
(Sydney) still holds the Australian record with 20.
* * * *
The S. Aus. Jockey Club clings to the idea
of three stipendiary stewards, which has now had a
good trial. Other S.A. clubs mostly agree that chair-
man Hogan, who gets £6OO a year, should be re-
tained, but that the honorary article could replace
the other two, who are at present Clem Hill
(cricketer and sharebroker) and Tom Wigley (sport-
ing lawyer). The S.A.J.C. proposes an unsatisfac-
tory compromise, merely reducing the pay of the
two from £4OO each to £2OO. Certainly the other
clubs urged economy when their deputation waited
on the Jockey Club, but that was not their main
point, and a mere reduction of salaries has so far
found few to support it.
It is stated that Georges Carpentier is to
get leave from the French army to proceed to
Yankeeland and fig-ht fo» the Red Cross Funds. The
Frenchman is after Willard ; but Willard may have
too much bingey these times to be enthusiastic.
Anyhow, doubt on the subject is provoking someone
to suggest that a Carpentier-Darcy disturbance would
be of great interest. But Darcy isn’t out after
splosh for the Red Cross. Which, after all, is just as
well. A donation from Darcy to buy a wooden leg
for a man who fought for his country would, in all
the circs., look an indecent thing.
JACK WREN.
The Stadium people are trying to sort
out the ringer among the big ’uns, and made a start
in Sydney on Saturday by pushing Colin Bell and
Les O’Donnell together. There was 14st. of Bell and
12st. 6lb. of O’Donnell. Bell stopped a few which
were much admired by the people who were not
taking delivery of them, but most of the time he
was depositing heavy hands on the enemy. The
war of exhaustion lasted until the gong went for a
patched-up peace of a minute’s duration. Bell, who
was handing out copious biff at the moment, at once
dropped his hands and stepped back. Whereupon
O’Donnell reckoned the time was ripe, and dropped
his adversary with an emphatic right to the jaw.
This being contrary to the Hague Convention, the
house resounded with the yell of remonstrance, and
Scott awarded the bacon to the smitten Bell. O’Don-
nell explained that he did not hear the ring-off
signal. As he had to be cautioned for continuing
after the second round was called, it looks as if
his hearing has gone a bit stale.

Jack Jannese was still hanging on to the
bantam championship at the end of a battle with
Vince Blackburn at Sydney Stadium. Vincent had
the punch and John the skill, and once more was
scientific wallon justified before the mob —because it
didn't get a woodener.
Jack Cole and Harry Stone carried on
Biffness as usual at Brisbane on Saturday. It was
carthorse versus trotter. Stone broke into an early
gallop and pasted his weighty opponent with much
emphasis through the subsequent proceedings. The
continuous arrival of disaster in the bread-basket
nearly put Cole’s light out in the last two rounds,
and Stone was the referee’s only possible choice.
(P.S. —The sole Chow spectator got bored about half-
time, and left.!
They are getting cocky up Bundaberg
(Q.) way since Australia turned the Referendum
down. This is from the local News: ‘Challenge,

out side bet, best of 20 rounds. —G. F. Holzberger.
Englishman Llew Edwards and Matt
Murphy played a duet at Melbourne Stadium on
Saturday, but at the eighth verse Edwards suddenly
smacked Matthew on the chin. The selection termi-
nated after the referee had solemnly counted 10 while
the recumbent Matt hearkened not unto the voice
which bade him arise and awake.

Brunswick, the Melbourne home of bricks
and biff, has had no luck with its stadium. Two
or three years ago, when there seemed to be money
in the game, a syndicate was struck with the idea ot
making the suburb a boxing centre, and spent
£3OOO to that end. Brunswick was a thickly popu-
lated industrial ant-hill, full of hard-doers who
preferred stoush to symphonies, and far enough
from town to support its own bash studio without
fear of city competition. But the right-thinking
local council inspected the crowd which follows in
the boxers’ train and refused a license. Since then
the syndicate has tried many things to popularise the
stadium, but all in vain. The struggle ends with
the sale of the white elephant, and the picture-shows
in Sydney-road have things all their own way once
more.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Ned Trickett and
Jim Punch (B. 7/12/’l6). When the former opened
his pub on the N.E. corner of King and Pitt
streets, Jim Punch, who occupied the N.W. corner,
used to parade in front in early morning and draw
his friends’ attention to the opposition sign, remark-
ing: “That’s what you get for bringing a man out.”
Punch paid all the expense of the champion’s trip to
England. Trickett, however, wasn’t much of a pub-
lican. He tried three or four houses, but failed to
draw anywhere, perhaps because he was a very
silent man.
Nearly half a century ago, when sculling
was a thriving sport on the N.S.W. Northern rivers,
it was quite common for the Richmond and Clarence
men to carry their boats on their shoulders over
the Woodburn-Chatsworth road, a distance of nearly
30 miles. The roads were so primitive that carried
on a cart there would be danger of a wreck en route,
so the crews trusted to shanks’s pony.

The Balmain (N.S.W.) Ladies’ Rowing
Club enjoyed some variety on Saturday. The first
heat of the Club Handicap was rowed in a wave of
midsummer; the second against a fresh southerly ; the
final (in swimming togs) in a tropical downpour.
The winner was a scratch damsel, Miss Beaumont —
a sculling Juno.

Norman Burrows, of East Melbourne
Harriers, is one of the latest to take part in the
Hun-hunt. Burrows was a tower of strength to his
club, and his services were usually in demand for
the bloodless battles at the Australasian champion-
ships. In 1906 he did the hat trick, winning the
half-mile, mile and three-mile Vic. track champion-
ships.

The Tasmanian Amateur Athletic Assoc,
has something to be unashamed of. No fewer than
90 per cent, of the pack have enlisted. Phil Turner,
lately outed, annexed the last mile walking champion-
ship of the Speck in 7min. 8 4-ssec. —a record. A
rare good heel-and-toe artist was Philip.

M. C. Orackanthorp, a Fort-street (Syd-
ney) schoolboy, may skittle some of the swimming
records —if he doesn’t wear himself to shreds trying
to win whole programmes. In the schoolboy cham-
pionships last week he won 100yds. (64 4-ssec.),
220yds. (3min. lsec.), 440yds. (7min. s£sec.),
880yds. (lomin. 8 l-ssec.), finished second to
Kirkland (Sydney High) in the 50yds., and ’tween
whiles plugged along in relay events. This youngster
is a limb of the Crackanthorp family that made a
name in the strenuous business of winning chess
championships.
“John H.”: “Barcoo” (B. 23/11/T6) is
not quite correct in attributing to the late George
Melrose, senior, of Mount Pleasant, the feat of cover-
ing per blucher 60 miles in less than 24 hours.
Mount Pleasant is only 36 miles from Adelaide and
the distance has more than once been walked by an
old footballer and sport of the Holy City—R. Coonan
—in from six to eight hours. Nevertheless, George
Melrose, senior, was a sturdy Scotch pioneer whose
early struggles were marked by a good many feats
of endurance.

Tall performances in recent Sydney junior
cricket: E. Loveridge, 117, the fourth century in
five matches; L. W. Wing (S. G. School), 7
wickets for 7 runs against St. Joseph’s; Brand (Gor-
don II.), 116 against High Schools, made chiefly with
boundary smites; and G. Mclntyre (Little Coogee),
317, including 14 sixers.
“J.F.H.” : Lord Hawke, long-time captain
of the Yorkshire county cricket team, and well
known in Australia, lately married a widow, to the
disgust of a lot of enterprising mammas who had
given him up as hopeless. This change of condition
seems to have turned him into a very serious person
and to have opened his eyes to evils that had not
particularly struck him in his free-and-easy, long-
protracted bachelor days. So he has become a
religious revivalist, as well as a benedict, and in the
former capacity has been addressing a big missionary
meeting in the Albert Hall, Leeds.

Dogfish cutlets at 3d. a pound, please!
The despised “gummy” has been discovered by a
citizen of the U.S. —Dr. Smith, a commissioner of
the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries —to be one of the
finest-eating fishes in the sea. As the confounded
dogfish is a brute which has discounted the pleasures
of a million fishing- trips off these shores by greedily
grabbing the bait and then coming aboard and
twining himself around the machinery, it seems
worth while to consider him from the U.S. expert’s
angle. Smith says that the dog-fish lives on the
choicest delicacies of the deep and “its taste and
texture are precisely what would be expected from
its own diet, the repellent appearance of the fish
beinn- all that has saved it from becoming a prime
favorite.” Meantime we Australians daily devour tons
of the rank, parasite-infested barracouta-—-a fish which
bears the same relation to, say, whiting as horse-
flesh does to spring chicken.

lii the seaside councillor’s reckoning, a
shark in the sea is worth two on the sand—especi-
ally when the pair on the sand have been there for
several days under a hot sun. One of Sydney’s rod-
and-line shark sports has been leaving his captured
man-eaters on the Bondi beach, and the local coun-
cil has now struggled to its feet with its handker-
chief to its aldermanic nose and ordered that, in
future, he must remove any brute he hauls ashore
to die. Alive, the things are a dangler to Bondi’s
surfing customers; but while they swim they don’t
smell.
“Ursa Minor” : As many a roundsman has
noted when copy is scarce, there is a lot of good
news to be got out of a circus. George Wirth’s
bears are cases in point. While his circus was in
the Goulburn Valley (Vic.) lately, there was a
great sensation at Shepparton, owing to a farmer
having discovered in his irrigation dam what was
thought to be a headless corpse wrapped in canvas.
It was found to be the circus’s late polar bear, which
had died, so to speak, on active service. Wirth had
had it skinned and had given instructions to have
the corpse buried in quicklime, but the undertaker,
whoever he was, dumped it in the dam to save the
trouble of a huge excavation. This bear was the
one which, when Ilackenschmidt, the wrestler, was
in Melbourne, was so scientifically cross-buttocked
in an encounter it had with a brown bear that
George himself suggested that he should wrestle the
victor, whose claws were to be protected by boxing
gloves. Wirth agreed, but on considering the hug-
power of a bear the Russian thought better of it.

“Helersy”: Re the two young women
who rode 430 miles in 15 days (B. 23/11/’l6). Last
summer two girls rode from Melbourne via Walsh’s
Creek, to Woods’ Point and back through Jamieson
and Marysville, covering 330 miles in 14 days. As
they went for pleasure, record-breaking was not on
the menu. The 40 miles between Walsh’s Creek and
Woods’ Point was covered in one day, with only a
couple of mouthfuls of bread for lunch, obtained at
the one solitary house on the road, 20 miles from
the next-door neighbor. The only other travellers
met were two men with a few sheep, one motor
cyclist and millions of flies! After one day at
Woods’ Point the girls rode the 40 miles to Jamieson,
and from there back to Melbourne. In spite of the
heat and flies there is at least one of the two who
would gladly go again. I know because I’m it.

Australia has not yet started to build
motor-cars from end to end, but it knows something
about making tyres, and among the various brands
turned out locally the “Boomerang,” produced by
the Barnet Glass Co., refuses to be displaced by
anything imported. The ordinary stud or projection
on a noil-skid tyre has no particular properties or
features. The “Boomerang,” on the other hand, has
a scientific diversion of angles, and the open passages
allow the air, dust, etc., to pass through freely.
* * * *
“X.Y.” : The advice given by “Condamine”
(B. 16/11/’l6) is the best for anyone to adopt who
wants to destroy a gun or rifle barrel. It is, in fact,
the method used in breaking up massive steel and iron
casting's. A hole is drilled in the direction of the
desired fracture, an accurately-fitting plug, or
piston, of steel is fitted to it; the hole is almost
filled with water or oil, the plug inserted, and the
end of the plug struck by a heavy hammer or
“monkey.” The result is a burst without flying
fragments. I do not doubt that an obstruction may
sometimes be removed from a gun-barrel in this way
without apparent damage, but damage will be there
all the same. I once knew a man who had a rag
stuck in the left-hand barrel of his gun within two
or three inches of the choke. He tried to drive it
out with a hardwood rod and hammer, from the
breech end, and, failing, commenced to assault the
muzzle. The result was a compacted obstruction.
Being a casual chap, he filled up with a big blank
charge, and pointing the gun out of the window fired.
The obstruction vanished. A few weeks later he
fired the barrel again, and got the surprise of his
life. Using a cartridge of modern power and reli-
able make, with a free bore, the barrel was shattered
as though made of glass. The best way of removing
an obstruction is to use the “claw” devised for that
purpose ; but if this instrument is not at hand, a rag
may be burnt out with a red-hot rod of brass or
copper. Iron or steel may be used if there are no
sharp points on it. It may be kept from contact
with the sides of the bore by winding fine copper
wire round it. Never buv a gun unless the inside of
the barrel is as smooth and bright as the surface of
a mirror. After using, clean the barrel thoroughly
and lubricate with raw vaseline. Never use the
steel wire scratch-brush supplied with some cleaning
outfits. This breaks the protective coating, and is
followed by rust. Always look through the barrel of
a gun before loading to see if an idiot has hidden
anything for a joke. And never lend your shooting
gear to anyone.

From an Australian who has been study-
ing Uncle Sam :
The Yank who preached a little sermon on the
folly of low-production and the beauty of “wrestling
with something” (B. 30/11/’l6) has my support
and encouragement. I don’t throw my own figures
forward; I give those of Dr. Thomas Cherry, the
Prof, of Agriculture at Melbourne University. Vic-
toria runs two-thirds the sheep and one-fifth the
horses and cattle fed in the State of lowa ; but the
land cropped in lowa, “in spite of a winter of
almost Arctic severity,” is 2't times as great, as in
Victoria. Nature, in short, favors Victoria, and the
Victorian leans heavily upon the lady. There are
20,000,000 acres of closer-settlement country in
climatically-blessed Victoria, only 4 per cent, of
which is cultivated, as against lowa’s record of 54
per cent. Yes, a little more Australian sweat would
do this country a lot of good.

UNIQUE PROCESS FOR
RETAINING AND
REGAINING BEAUTY.
By Mlle. Charlotte Sirxer.
Does your skin chap or roughen easily, or become
unduly red or blotchy? Let me tell you a quick and
easy way to overcome the trouble and keep your com-
plexion beautifully white, smooth and soft. Just get
some ordinary mercolised wax at the chemist’s, and
use a little before retiring as you would use cold
cream. The wax, through some peculiar action, flecks
off the rough, discolored or blemished skin. The
worn-out cuticle comes off just like dandruff on a
diseased scalp, only in almost invisible particles. Mer-
colised wax simply hastens Nature’s work, which is
the rational and proper way to attain a perfect com-
plexion, so much sought after but very seldom seen.
The process is perfectly simple and quite harmless.
* * * *
It is astounding the number of women who suffer
from unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know that
there is a simple substance known as powdered
pheminol which will remove it immediately and per-
manently. Mix a small quantity into a thin paste
with a ‘little water, and apply to the objectionable
growths. In two minutes all trace of the hair will
have entirely vanished, and your skin will be as soft
and smooth as a child’s.
** * *
The hair should be allowed to breathe, and the
greasy film around each strand must be removed with
a mild non-alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be
tabooed. The very best solution for the purpose can
be made by dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax
granules in a cup of hot water. It stimulates the
scalp to healthy action, and at the same time leaves
' the hair in that soft, fluffy condition so much
admired. Any chemist can supply you with ar
original packet of stallax, sufficient to make 25 c
30 shampoos.
* * *
One need not resort to the very questionable ex-
pedient of hair-dye in order not to have grey hair
The grey hair can easily be changed back to a
natural color in a few days’ time merely by the
application of a simple, old-fashioned and perfectly
harmless home-made lotion. Procure from your
chemist two ounces of tammalite concentrate, and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply this to
the hair a few times with a small sponge and you
Will soon have the pleasure of seeing your grey hair
gradually darkening to the desired shade. The lotion
is pleasant, not sticky or greasy, and dois not injure
the hair in any way. I 2

Rome has fallen! The first time Julius
Superbus Knight knitted a pair of socks for
patriotic auction they brought £135. Last
week, at the Victorian Stanley’s vice-regal
show, another pair of foot-Knighties were
put up and scored one wretched bid of six
bob! The treasures were sadly passed in by
the honorary auctioneer and J. Knight’s
press-agent rushed out and climbed a tree.
“Ho, Ho”: Allan Wilkie is never above
improving Shakspeare with new lines, and
in the AVilkie revival of “The School for
Scandal,” at Melbourne Princess’s, a few
jests that were apparently overlooked by
Sheridan are thoughtfully provided by one
of the comedians. The gagging in the third
act should earn a lynching for someone.
When Moses meets Trip he persists in _ mis-
understanding the name and wittily
addresses the haughty servitor as Tripe. Dur-
ing ' the sale of the Surface family portraits
Moses keeps up a fusillade of pithy com-
ment. Charles disposes of an ancestor who
had occupied the woolsack. “One grand-
father and a sack of wool,” remarks Moses
brightly. A portrait of a maiden aunt in a
pastoral setting is sold. “One maiden aunt,
slightly damaged, and two fat sheep,” ob-
serves Moses as he makes the entry. The
other sales produce similar brain-waves.
How favored we are in having a comedian
who is a wittier dog than Sheridan knew
how to be! Then why give Sheridan all the
credit for it?
“Pass-out Check”: The Melbourne Age
seems to have developed a deep-rooted objec-
tion to the theatre making any profit. When
musical comedies are staged it protests that
managers are offering too trivial fare, and
demands a more serious theatre. It got
what it demanded with “Damaged Goods,”
but now insists in criticising from the point
of view of “entertainment.” The Brieux
drama was never submitted as an entertain-
ment. All the Williamson announcements
made that abundantly clear. Also, the Age
objects to a propagandist play being pre-
sented by “the commercial theatre,” charg-
ing that it is staged for profit. Did we ever
hear of a play being deliberately put forward
for loss? How does the Age expect the
charges associated with a metropolitan
theatre to be met without an admission
tariff? When the Age does a little propa-
ganda work on its own account it doesnt
make a free distribution of papers. Nobody
expects it to. Finally, why should it be a
crime to speak the word “syphilis” any more
than to print it?
Tien Hogue, a daughter of “Jimmy,” for-
merly N. S. Wales Minister for Education,
is understudying Sara Allgood in Maoriland.
She is to be the Peg of the co. when it tours
the Australian provinces.
“Bob D.”: The Bulletin par. (16/11/’l6)
re the glorification of Chaplin from plain
Charlie to haughty Charles only reflects half
the celestial ray which shines around his
pedestal. In ’Murka he is now billed as
Charles Spencer Chaplin, and when a man is
called by his middle name he is on the
highest pinnacle. By the way, the Spencer
Chap.’s first picture-work was done under
the name of EdglUr English.
“Jwosp”: After spending something like
£200,000 on his big picture “Intolerance,”
David W. Griffith, the best producer of them
all, has discovered that there is not enough
scope in the screen and is going to the stage.
The unintelligent film censorship has broken
Griffith’s patience and he takes 'his artistic
revenge by stopping in mid-career —and
America must notice it and think. He left
the speaking stage a few years ago an actor
with a paltry screw. Now he’s going to risk
a picture-made fortune as a producer. Grif-
fith reckons that the really big picture
cannot be made to pay under present condi-
tions. The high-salaried star is the worm in
the bud and the locust on the leaf.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos the Boucicault wives
(B. 16/11/T6). Emily Soldene met Mrs.
Boucicault in New York, accompanied by her
son Aubrey. “One day we three went to a
matin6e at Wallack’s. We sat in the front
row of the stalls. Presently Mrs. Dion
nudged me. ‘Look there,’ said she, lifting
her eyes to a box just above us on my left.
In the box were seated Mr. Dion Boucicault
and his new wife, Louise Thorndyke Bouci-
cault. We were very close and could have
shaken hands all round, but we didn’t.”
Dion died in 1890, aged 69. Aubrey followed
in 1913. aged 44. Dion, junior, is 57 and
Nina 46. The latter made her first appear-
ance as Eily O’Connor in her father’s “Col-
leen Bawn” at Kentucky in 1885.
THE LASTEST PUFF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The actor man was dignified ;
The press-puff man was wild;
To all his queries Busk replied
With answers like a child.
Busk had not sung a comic song
In church when he was wed;
He did not like to take a throng
Of petted snakes to bed.
He had not lived on pumpkin-rind
For forty weeks; or sought
The large unfathomed wilds to find
Where thingmetites are caught.
His vices were not very bad;
His pet was not a hog;
He did not own a single fad
To set the world agog.
The actor said: “My claim to fame
Relies upon one fact —•
No wild, weird stunts need you proclai .1 —
’Tis simply: 1 can act!”
An inspiration seized the man
Who had to write the puff;
His fingers for his pencil ran;
He cried: “It is enough!”
With lurkng malice in his eye,
He wrote, in letters bold:
“The Man Who Told the Biggest Lie
That Ever Yet Was Told!”

'J'HE BLOOD is the energiser of the system. Upon its quality
depends the nourishment of every organ, every nerve-centre,
every muscle of the body.
Poorness of Blood is called Anaemia —girls, women and men
are all subject to it.
It manifests itself in breathlessness on slight exertion, pale
cheeks, lustreless eyes, depression and exhaustion.
If you have any of these symptoms, or are run-down and need
a tonic, take Iron ‘Jelloids’ to enrich the blood.
When the blood has been enriched and strengthened, Anaemia
is overcome —the symptoms give place to abundant vitality, rosy
cheeks, and a feeling of general “fitness” and well-being.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote :—“ Impoverished blood can bema.de rich and good
** by means of Iron 'Jello:ds,' the most effective and desirable treatment."

“Ooson” : I met that cheerful ass Blivins
again yesterday. He suffused such happi-
ness that I wasted half an hour finding out
what the new idea was. “It’s great,” he
said. “I’ve been appointed organiser of the
Farmers’ Union. In five years we reckon
to have roped in 95 per cent, of the wheat-
growers in the Commonwealth, and we’ll
fix things so that it will pay them to stay
in. They’ll have to stay in, in fact. Then
we’re ready. We gradually regulate things
till there is only a fortnight’s supply of
wheat in the country outside our stores.
Then, as soon as a great war comes along,
or until other wheat countries sustain a
failure of their crops, so that it is impossible
for Australia to import, we —er —cease work.
We do not strike. We merely notify the
public that it can obtain our wheat only
on our terms. Not only will we hold what
stocks we have, but we will decline to pro-
duce more unless on our terms. It’s
a great scheme and it can’t go wrong. All
we want is solidarity! What’s that? The
public would fight us! Rubbish! The
public won’t know till it is hit. and you
can’t fight worth tuppence when you’re
starving. Ask the coal-miners!”
I try all ways I know to get into their page,
But never strike it lucky;
When they look at these lines, they’ll ramp and
storm and rage;
To send them I am plucky.
But I don’t care a hang, I’m reckless with despair—
Great Poets always starve!
I bite my pen and nails, in hunger tear my hair,

“Nerves”
Our nerves are similar to
an intricate network of tele-
graph Wires. Controlled and
nourished by a portion of the
brain —known as the nerve
centres —the delicate thread-
like nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the
body So long as the nerve
centres are capable of con-
tinually supplying nourish-
ment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong
and healthy. But directly
the nerve centres become
weakened by overwork,
worry or anxiety, they are
unable to transmit the neces-
sary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
“on edge.” Then it is that
a sudden sound- makes you
’'jump”—you get irritable—
you suffer from neuralgia—
you are restless and de-
pressed. In this condition
there si nothing to equal
h
Because, being a powerful
nerve food,' Wincarnis' gets
right to the root of the trouble,
and. by creating a supply of
new nerve force, stimulates
and re-vitalises the whole
nervous system. Try

IN
BANANA LAND
Bananaland Labor, elated with its recent
heresy hunts, has decided on another purge.
Der-rink is the latest heterodoxy, and the
Metropolitan Labor Council is calling upon
the C.P.E. (the Bananaland P.L.L.) to re-
fuse endorsement to two or three M’s.L.A.
because Stiggins says they visit the bar
rather often. Queensland Parliament, as a
matter of fact, is one of the soberest imag-
inable, but the aspirants for the other
fellow’s job are so numerous that something
has to be done to root a few of the present
men out.
“Rangan”: Bananaland’s Minister for
Agriculture Lennon some time back set out
with much noise to wipe tuberculosis from
the dairying herds of Queensland. He began
by sweeping through the herds of the Gatton
State Farm. All at once there was a
tremendous silence. The fact was that a
large number of high-class cows that out-
wardlv showed no signs of the disease were
condemned by the test. A large number of
others were found to be slightly infected.
The wholesale destruction of high-class
breeders set Lennon thinking. He is still
thinking—which explains the continuance of
the tremendous silence.
Exit from active service at the end of
this month, “Majah” Cahill, Bananaland’s
chief policeman. In the furious uproar at
the time of the tramway strike of 1912
Cahill got somewhat damaged in a fall, and
hasn’t had the same punch since. He goes
out with £5OO per annum —half his present
salary. The favorites for the job are
Inspector O’Sullivan, head of th» detectives,
and Inspector O’Connor, of Toowoomba,
whom the Labor Government has been
pushing along recently at an astounding-
pace.
“Itan”: Light has been thrown on the
pending Chillagoe deal between the co. and
the Bananaland Government. When the
works closed down some time ago solicitor
Thynne suggested a sale of the Cmilagoe
railway for £900,000. Ryan thought it too
much and Thynne dropped £lOO,OOO. Still
Ryan halted. Later, when he went to Lon-
don, he interviewed the debenture-holders,
who were on the point of foreclosing, and
they named £450,000, just half what Thynne
asked at first. Thynne wrote to Ryan com-
plaining of this “wrecker’s price.” “My chief
concern is Queensland’s interests,” replied
Ryan. The Government was later on
attacked by Thynne in one House and by
his partner, Opposition-leader Macartney, in
the Assembly; and now, of course, it is
suggested that there is a connection between
the two things, and that no serious notice
ought to be taken of Macartney’s criticisms
of the Government. But it doesn’t sound at
all convincing, because Macartney, as leader
of the Opposition, would have attacked the
Government in any case. And Ryan and
his friends know it.
Hodgson, of the Anglican Bush Brother-
hood out Richmond way, told his flock that if
they did not vote Yes on October 28 he
would enlist. The sheep went No; so Hodg-
son burnt his sermons and steered for the
recruiting office. Thinking Archbish. Don-
aldson might object, he enlisted in Bunda-
berg. But the Archbish. discovered him
and clasped the back-to-front collar on the
would-be private and sent him away as a
chaplain.
The Queensland Government has at last
made a move to help Brisbane widen its
streets. A Bill has been introduced giving
considerable powers to the Council to
resume land without the cumbersome pro-
ceedings under the Public Works Resump-
tion Act. If the new measure becomes law
the Council will simply notify in the
Gazette and two daily papers that it wants
certain land ; then it will wait for 90 days,
after which time the owner will be liable
to a fine of £5O if he fails to deposit the
title deeds with the Registrar. The Land
Court is to settle any disputes, and from all
appearances the Court will have its hands
full. The Council is going to make a start
with Adelaide-street, which is to be widened
by 14 feet and include a tram-track.
“Eta”: The Bulletin is wrong about
Jimmy Cowlishaw when it says that he has
at last spoken in the Leg. Council. He made
a speech once before. It was on a proposed
newspaper law. Jimmy is a newspaper direc-
tor. Besides, he has been in the Council
only 38 years.
There is great wailing in Brisbane —and
some gay chortling. Nov. 30 was the last
day for lodging petitions praying for a local
option poll, by which one-fourth of the
pubs in an electoral district may be closed on

along its petition, but the Department found
that it contained many names not on the

up the required number. Consequently there
will be no poll in the Brisbane City division,
and three'years must elapse before a further
petition can be made. It was a great win
for the midnight-crayfish party.
Died last week, aged nobody can tell what
for certain, “Jack” Hamilton, known on all
the old northern rushes as “the Doctor,” and
afterwards M.P. for Burke. Jack was as big-
and soft-hearted a man as ever walked, but he
loved a fight for all that; and that and pluck
and rare skill with his fists, helped by his re-
putation as a rifle and revolver shot, won him
more votes than his politics. On the Palmer
rush he had a tremendous practice as a
doctor. He wasn’t formally qualified ; but he
knew how to deal with most diggers’
troubles. Once, in his very successful days,
he established a hospital at a cost of over
£5OOO, and ran it in characteristic fashion.
If a man could pay he had to. If he made a
rise afterwards and didn’t pay, then he had
to fight Jack for it. Pretty often, after the
fight, if the patient had behaved very badly,
Jack had to admit him again. As a revolver
shot Hamilton was at one time among the
world’s best. “No credit to me,” he said.
“It’s just heredity. I come from a border
clan of men who were always either robbing
or being robbed, and we had to shoot quick.”
Passed out a few days ago, Daniel
O’Connor, of Oxley; the northern climate
and the worries of banking killed him at the
early age of 91. Born on St. Helena, as a
boy of 15 he saw the French mission arrive
to remove Napoleon’s body. He came to
Australia in ’52, went to Ballarat, and then
crossed over to N. S. Wales and passed into
the overdraft industry. At the age of 88 he
rambled to England and trotted about
unattended.
“P.A. J.”: As it is believed in Ministerial
circles that there is a dangerous decline in
Labor support, three at least of the Cabinet
are credited with a desire to get a “ stiddy
job” outside of politics. Legislation before
the. Assembly provides for several safe well-
salaried anchorages, but as these measures
go up to the Council, that body, acting on
a cruel tip from the Courier, is placing
barb-wire entanglements and other impedi-
ments right in the fairway that _ leads to
the desirable billets. Ryan and his fellow-
Ministers are now thinking out desperate ex-
pedients to circumvent the enemy, even to
the extent of flooding the Council.
“Mario”: F. W. Ward’s unexpected ap-
pointment to the editorship of Brisbane
Telegraph means that George Woolnough
has laid up his pen after working it hard
for a half-century. Whatever else he was or
wasn’t, he certainly was a pastmaster of
“style.” How he hated a split infinitive !
It was my great good fortune to know him
away from his desk, in the home where his
old wife, with her gentle ways, brought out
all that was sweetest and best in the kindly
and charming host. A copy of his book
“Kosmos,” inscribed with the nicest compli-
ment I ever received, has an honored
place among my household gods. Mrs. Wool-
nough has gone on the long, long journey,
and that is no doubt why her knight has put
away his lance. Everyone hopes he may
find life easy without it. His successor
hasn’t. He retired full of honor from the
chair of the Sydney Telegraph a couple
of years ago, hoping to nurse back his health
and enjoy an easy old age —he is 67. But
he has found that idleness is not ease.
There are 2293 cattle-dips operating in
the State, and analyses made recently of
the dipping fluids used showed that fully
one-half were useless for tick destruction,
as they did not contain the necessary 81b.
of arsenic per 400 gallons. Following on
this disclosure a regulation has been issued
providing for the compulsory analysis half
yearly of all dipping fluids.
His Letter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He’s not a word —not one —to say
Of generals and fine array,
Of kings and lords and toffs he’s seen
In watery Prance and England green;
It’s just a tale of trench and mud
An’ hairbreadth ’scapes an’ flowin’ blood,
Of how he dreamt the other week
He’d wandered back to Krismus Creek,
Of how he’s comfy in the main
An’ what he’ll do when back again.
An’ all through what he writes there runs
A curious sound o’ rollin’ guns.
You hear a rattle. If we knew,
It means machine-guns breaking through. ...
There’s a poor chap upon his face
Was once the pride of Hawker’s place;
An’ when he fell they found a blue,
Wee scrap of note with: “Love to Lou!”
“Of course,” he says, “we’re bound to win
An’ end in triumph at Berlin” ;
An’ glad we are he takes it so
Instead o’ tellin’ tales o’ woe.
But over many a thousand mile
We seem to see our Billjim smile,
An’ so we feel he’s just the same
Old boy who went “to play the game,”
An’ let the Turk an’ Teuton see
What sort o’ breed Australians be.
Yes, when he writes, so frank an’ free,
The gritty boy who won V.C.,
He’s just the same that sailed away
To Gaba Teep an’ Suvla Bay—
Who took our hearts, the careless cuss,
An’ went an’ left his own with us.

Brisbane, December 9, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
“Allies’ City,” .in aid of our Patriotic
Fund, was opened to-day by J. M. Hunter,
Minister for Lands. This new outbreak is r
in the Botanical Gardens, and consists of a
jumble of stalls and sideshows. If the
profits are on the same scale as the noise
the Fund will burst the vaults of the bank.
At the races to-day Premier Ryan’s pretty
wife looked youthful in violet chiffon
taffetas and Mrs. E. G. Theodore cool in
summery white. Floral muslin and white
frocks were the feature of the panorama, and
most of the peacocks strutted in a shoulder
cape.
Gladys Frost’s students gave a recital on
Thursday night as a token of respect for
the Soldiers’ Comforts Fund. The lady
herself, in a blue frock, stroked the piano
and made it feed out of the hand, so to speak.
Killed in action in France, Lieut. R. D.
Leslie, aged 26. His wife, who was Miss
Barbara Brand, was a prominent member
of the Ladies’ Rowing Club.
After “The Messiah,” the bait with which
enthusiasts and cloak-carriers are being
lured into the Exhibition Hall to-night, the
Musical Union will cease from troubling
until next year.
The Christmas Toy Fund amounts now
to well over £lOO. Lady Goold-Adams went
down to Kennedy Wharf yesterday and in-
spected the playthings, which are to be dis-
tributed next week. The Railway Depart-
ment has promised to carry mothers and
children free of cost to the scene, but not
so the Tramways Co. . Good old Private
Enterprise couldn’t afford to give soldiers’
wives and kiddies a lift.
The W.C.T.U. held a “coin afternoon” in
the Albert Hall on Friday. Lieut. Maurice
Little, who was blinded at Gallipoli, related
an anecdote of how a sergeant was seen
to pass a pot of beer to the sentry on duty
at the sergeant’s mess. The yarn shocked
every female present, which, of course,
ensured the success of the gathering. We
all love to be shocked, as you know, Thargo-
mindah.
L,ance-Corporal Bailey, the 9th Battalion
boy who has driven the motor-car belonging
to the Red Cross Kitchen ever since it was
bought, was attached to a wristlet watch
on Thursday. Mrs. Bale, the convener of
the hospitals sub-committee, buckled the
lad to the timepiece in the presence of an
admiring circle of petticoats.
A “croquet afternoon” in aid of the 9th
Battalion Comforts Fund prinked up the
lawns of the South Brisbane Croquet Club
on Thursday. The helpers proudly sported
the battalion colors—royal blue and black.
Much coin was raked in, and King Billjim
IX won’t have any reason to say this
Christmas that the folks at home have for-
gotten him. The cash is to be cabled to
the C.O. and spent on or about the spot.
That’s the only way to be sure of getting it
to the spot.
Honolulu bids fair to be the chief ren-
dezvous of the wandering Australian this
summer. T.he Lumley Hill dame, of Belle-
vue, with daughters Evelyn and Mrs. A.
11. Whittingham, Mr. Whittingham and
various other members of the clan, are
booked for its smiling shores on the
Niagara’s next trio.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

THERE is something most satisfactory about
having on the right shoes for the occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent leather, which always
looks well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one’s spring suit or
summer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Bostock shoes, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality which
sets them apart amongst ready-made shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of shoes made specially to measure.

An Old and Trusted Friend
with Hundreds of Shavers.
A member of the Victorian Board of Pub-
lic Health alleges that Melbourne under-
takers buy up grave sites and sell them at
exorbitant prices:—
“O, Death, where is thy sting?” Of course,
You know the ancient stave.
The undertaker makes it plain—
He “stings” you for your grave!
The inexhaustible supply of Eureka
veterans was reduced by one when J. J.
Corran died late last month at Murrumbeena
(Vic.) in his 84th year. In the name of his
house, Tynward, could be discerned the fact
that he was a Manxman, the Tynwald being
the title of the Parliament of the Isle of
Man. He came to Australia when 19, and,
although in Lalor’s brigade of rebels, he
admitted that he did nothing to stop the
advance of the 40th Regiment on the stock-
ade. In his later years he was a Hawksburn
newsagent.
“Hamer” : A Sydney woman is sitting and
thinking. Before her on the table lies a
letter from her soldier-husband:—
Dear Missus, —You will never see me again. I
was killed a week ago in an attack on a trench —
shot through the heart and the stomach.— Tom.
The handwriting is that of her husband. An
official communication informs her that he
has been killed, and the official date is
earlier than that on the letter. It is a nice
problem to be presented with.
“Clinker-Built”: The rowing expert who
writes notes for Melbourne Weekly Times
has an uncanny knack of selecting for timely
notice those who will shortly be rowing
stroke in Charon’s skiff. Hardly had he
paragraphed the aquatic exploits of Captain
F. S. Kelly, Williemotor’s brother, when the
cable arrived announcing the captain’s
death in action with the Naval Division in
France. Then the writer’s prophetic pen—
evidently a quill from some raven’s wing—
sketched the career of Ned Trickett.
Promptly came a telegram from Sydney
announcing the sculling champion’s death
at Euralla, where he was fatally crushed by
the collapse of a well which he was sinking
on his son’s selection.
“L.S.”: Advt. in a Brisbane paper:—
To Sell, two gentlemen and one lady’s Bicycle, £6
the lot; apply S. Blank, Albion.
Two antis, no doubt; and the bicycle thrown
in to make weight.
“T. 0.1.”; The limited supply of gas dur-
ing the coal strike and the consequent diffi-
culty in the kitchen recalls the fact that in
the first ’fifties in Melbourne and other Vic-
torian towns the cooking of dinners was part
of the business of the ordinary bakers of
bread. Sixpence per dish was charged and
gladly paid, especially on the Sunday. There
were many ovens which baked only on that
day. Industrious men built these in their
i backyards, and thrifty wives collected the
bawbees. According to custom, by the way,
it was part of the white man’s burden to
do the carrying to and fro.
A notice in English pinned up by a French
Mayor for the information of his Australian
guests:—■
The Mayor asks Nobody, neither men or horses, to
intercept here, as this house is lived by two very old
women. Take care that the horses deteriorate not the
trees.
“The Deemster”: It has been given in
evidence before Cussen, J., in the Melbourne
Tramway arbitration case, that the rolling
stock which, first jangled through the city
when the cable service began in 1884, is still
on the job, and still has one-third of its
original usefulness left. The box cars last, it
is alleged, for 45 or 50 years, and the grip
cars for 35 years, so that a young blood of
the ’Bo’s who took his best girl for a tram-
ride may travel by the self-same car when
he goes home, sacked by the coal strike, after
having grown grey in his boss’s service. Here
is a chance for the Sentimental Bloke to get
busy with a lyric about Cupid and the Car.
An expert declined to state definitely the
value of a vehicle which had reached the scrap-
heap stage, but admitted that it might bring
£lO or £l5 for use as a seaside shack —like
the ’Frisco cars in Gelett Burgess and Will
Irwin’s story, “The Picaroons.” Will Irwin,
by the way, must not be confused with WaF
lace Irwin, who wrote “The Love Sonnets
of a Hoodlum,” the American prototype of
Dennis’s Australian verse-cycle of “The Sen-
timental Bloke.” The ground-plan was simi-
lar, but the structure was different. A
sample, delineating how the Hoodlum felt
when, had he been the Bloke, he would have
groaned “Crool Forehin’s got me snouted jist
a treat” :
I sometimes think that I am not so good;
That there are warmer, foxier babes than I,
That Fate has given me the calm go-by,
And my long suit is sawing mother’s wood.
Then would I duck from under, if I could —
Catch the hog special on the jump, and fly
To some Goat Island planned by destiny
For dubs and has-beens and that solemn brood.
H. T. Easterby, head of Bananaland
Sugar Experiments Stations, has just
drawn attention to the way “South Euro-
peans” are displacing Britishers in the
Northern sugar industry. On the Herbert
and Johnstone and at Mourilyan British
farmers and cutters numbered 485; the
non-British totalled 766. Whereas at
Babinda three years ago “there were only
two foreigners in occupation of cane farms,
to-day there is stated to be 40 pgr cent.”
On the Herbert River the Victoria mill
employs 118 British and 32 Italians; the
Macnade mill 68 Britishers. 38 Italians;
Mourilyan 30 British, 33 Italians, four
Germans and three Austrians. The Italians
farm on the communal system, and seldom
employ a man under the awards.
Matthew Richmond, who bosses the Tech,
at Collingwood (Vic.), where a squad of
returned battered soldiers are making Aus-
tralian toys, has announced that the enter-
prise is now paying its way. It is ad-
mitted, however, that at present almost any
old price can be got for a plaything. Later
on, when the war is over, there will be tens
of thousands of damaged German soldiers at
the same business of toy-making; and unless
we get in promptly with a tariff so high that
a Noah’s Ark can’t possibly climb over it,
we shall be feeding Fritz and starving Bill-
jim.

Do you feel out of humor and think
that everyone has a grudge against you,
because everything seems to be going
wrong? It is you that is “wrong,” and it
is your liver that has the grudge against
you—possibly because you are not treat-
ing it well. You have given it too much
work to do, and when it wanted a gentle
laxative to set it right you neglected to
attend to it. To set your liver right, to
make things go well, and to make your-
self feel good all over, take a course of
Chamberlain’s Tablets and you will be
more than pleased with the result. Cham-
berlain’s Tablets are unsurpassed for
irritability.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are purely vege-
table, and contain no ingredient that
can in any way be injurious to the most
delicate person. Their action is mild and
gentle, without any of the painful sensa-
tions experienced by the use of pills.
Chamberlain’s Tablets act as a tonic,
strengthen the system and assist the
natural movement of the bowels.
The most common cause of constipa-
tion is a lack of exercise necessary_ to
keep the muscles of the bowels active.
That is why constipation is often brought
on by too frequent use of purgatives.
They act violently, performing the work
of the bowels for them, and so weaken
them that they will not act without
assistance. Chamberlain’s Tablets will
cure .constipation because, instead of
doing the work of the bowels, they gently
stimulate them to voluntary action.
Their frequent use will not injure the
most delicate person.
Indigestion means imperfect nourish-
ment, and that means poor health. In
these days of strenuous competition it is
the healthy man who wins. Nothing
equals Chamberlain’s Tablets for clearing
the stomach of undigested food and pro-
moting a flow of gastric juices which are
indispensable in the process of digestion.
Indigestion always produces a tendency
to constipation, and for this alone Cham-
berlain’s Tablets are invaluable.
DO NOT BE BEHIND THE TIMES,
but move with them. Salts, Castor Oil
and harsh purgatives are out of date,
and have been the cause of many a case
of constipation. Chamberlain’s Tablets
are the medicine that you want to take.
They cure constipation, indigestion, bili-
ousness, and cure them permanently.
Remember the name—Chamberlain’s
Tablets —and be sure you get them, for
there is nothing “just as good.”
NEVER FORGET that upon your
physical condition depends your comfort
and usefulness. That your condition will
be bettered, your figure increased, when
your bowels are regulated, your liver
stimulated and your digestion made
sound by taking Chamberlain’s Tablets
for the stomach and liver.
The old saying, “Coming events cast
their shadows before.” is especially true
of a bilious attack. You will have warn-
ing of its approach. Your appetite will
fail, you will feel dull and languid and
have a feeling of nausea. As soon as any
of these symptoms appear take three of
Chamberlain’s Tablets and the attack
may be warded off. By taking a course
of Chamberlain’s Tablets you will be
permanently relieved of all bilious ten-
dencies.
When the livef and bowels don’t act,
life is a failure. Chamberlain’s Tablets
wake these drowsy organs, like the sun
wakes the earth, and the whole body
laughs. It is fun to live when the body
is in good trim, but it is never so when
the liver and bowels shirk duty. There
is more happiness in a Is. 6d. box of
Chamberlain’s Tablets than you ever
dreamed of. They stimulate the nervous
system and make you feel young again.

Tablets -
Hot-weather liver troubles get many who enjoy
good health at all other times of the year.
Many people who generally enjoy
good health suffer from biliousness in the
summer time. Rich foods served cold
are difficult to digest by the majority and
often produce a chilling of the entire di-
gestive tract. The liver thus becomes
sluggish, when the condition known as
biliousness results.
This is often accompanied by constip-
ation and indigestion. Serious as it may
seem the unfortunate person can soon
remedy these ailments by taking Cham-
berlain's Tablets for the stomach and liver.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are a tonic laxa-
tive which contain ingredients that act on
the liver and stimulate it. They will re-
lieve hot-weather liver complaint very
quickly. ,
When you lack energy, don t relish
your food, feel dull and stupid, * all
you need is a dose of Chamberlain s
Tablets. They will make you feel like
a new man and give you an appetite
like a bear. They will do you more
good than a five shilling bottle of tonic.
If you have any indisposition of the
stomach, liver or bowels you should at
once take
it IiIVEP
By allowing yourself to become consti-
pated you are slowly and surely poisoning
yourself. When the bowels perform
their work they expel all poisonous mat-
ter, but when you allow yourself to
become constipated you absorb all this
poison into your system, thus laying the
seeds of many diseases. Some of the
signs of self-poisoning are headache, back-
ache, languidness, weariness, melancholy,
furred tongue, pasty complexion, loss of
appetite, etc. The safest antidote to such
poison is Chamberlain’s Tablets. These
Tablets stimulate the liver and bowels to
act naturally and gently. In doing so
they cleanse the stomach and purify the
blood. ,
NO, NEVER! A man with a healthy
liver does not contract diseases. During
recent epidemics in various parts of the
world thousands of people protected them-
selves by keeping their livers healthy and
active by the use of Chamberlain’s Tab-
lets. .
When the food leaves the stomach with-
out having gone through the requisite
process, as happens in cases of indiges-
tion, it is impossible for the liver to com-
plete the work. Therefore, look to your

A Splendid Toilet
Cream
No matter what
you pay for it, you
can get nothing
better for your skin
and complexion than
Icilma Cream. This
is a big claim —
but it’s true. You
wonder how it can be
sold at its price ?
Let us explain:
Icilma Cream has the
largest sale of any
British-made toilet cream
and is used by beautiful
women all over the world
from far Japan to Southern
Patagonia, from Arctic
Russia to Equatic Africa.
For this reason, and this alone,
Icilma Cream can be sold in
Australia at 1/6 per pot.
Its vast success is due to the
Icilma Natural Water which it
contains —this stimulates the
skin and regulates the flow of
natural oils. Use it daily and
look your best.
o
Cream
The famous English toilet preparation. ,
Fragrant and non-greasy. Guaranteed not to grow hair.
Price 1/6 per pot.
Of Chemists, Druggists, Stores, etc.

“Try Fluke” : If we were talking of tur-
nip-seed, I would explain that there is a
Maori bush hapu up at Ivaihu, on the North-
ern Wairoa, whose members are likely to re-
monstrate with you with a large sharp axe
if you happen to remark that you dote on
keha, the which is turnips. Once upon a
time, when the poor honest pakeha had
opportunities of making his pile out of John
Maori, this tribelet made a deal with one of
the Sydneyside schooner skippers for a con-
signment of gunpowder to enable them to
square accounts with the Ngati-Taurekareka,
of Hokianga or thereabouts. They filled his
ship with pigs and flax and kauri-gum and
other stuff sent down the Wairoa by canoe,
and then set to moulding bullets while they
waited for the powder. One small cask was
O.K. on arrival, but the others wouldn’t
spark worth tuppence, though the grains looked
the real thing. In disgust they chucked the
black stuff out in a heap behind the whares.
Soon up came a fine crop of turnips. The
hapu beat all paddling records to Kaipara
Heads to try to even up matters with the
swindler, but he showed them a nimble fore-
topsail. For five decades after that affair
of barter the Kaihu snipers were busy taking
utu for the facetious remarks made at their
expense by the other tattooed braves from
the Waitemata to the Spirits’ Leap ; and to
this day they haven’t succeeded in living it
down, for the name they are known by all
over the North is Ngati-Hoko-Reha, which
being translated is, “The Blokes Who Bought
the Turnips.”

“Quick Lunch”: Sydney apd Melbourne
racecourse caterers won’t be taking up much
war loan with the profits made this year.
After the last big Sydney misfire owing to
bad weather a trainload of pies were demand-
ing Christian burial; and the Melbourne Cup
postponement meant the hurried shovelling
out of sufficient light lunclieonry to satisfy
120,000 feeders. It’s no use singing “Wait
Till the Clouds Roll By” to an ageing pie
and a broken-hearted oyster that has been
evicted from its shell too soon.
The barque Inverclyde, from the U.S.A.,
with motor-cars and iron, puts in a claim
for the slow-voyage record. She took just a
year (less five days) from New York to Port
Adelaide. The cause was a great storm off
South Africa last February, which carried
away all her masts and smashed all her
boats. She stuck in the port of East London
till October, a new mainmast having to be
ordered from Scotland. Meanwhile the crew
cleared out to fight Germans with Botha;
and a native crew brought the Inverclyde on.
* * * *
Some pleasure, not to say excitement, is at
last to enter the dull, drab lives of those who
travel by the Melbourne cable trams. A new
kind of kerosene-light is to be installed —-
something on the old pressure-stove principle,
the oil being pumped up to the lamp from a
cylinder stowed underseat. The kitchen
vapor-stove has a fearful record of explo-
sions and lingering d'eath, but the new affair
is said to be fool-proof, and it certainly gives
a noble gleam.V For many years Private
Enterprise stingily kept the Melbourne tram-
traveller in a tantalising state of semi-dark-
ness, tinged with a bad smell, by employing
a one-eye-power oil-lamp. So the new light
will help to reduce the earnings of oculists
and spectacle-makers, whatever it may do for
undertakers.

“Simon”: Many years ago the beautiful
fine-grain English hogskin made a world-wide
reputation. Then the Germans went into
the pig-sticking business in earnest, and,
besides, became hide-buyers in the world’s
markets. Presently a rapidly-tanned “tinny”
imitation of the real skin at half the price
was elbowing the classic goods out. Then
the war started, German supplies were
cut off, and saddlers reminded their cus-
tomers once more that Australian bag
leather, made from cowhide, was immeasur-
ably superior to hogskin anyhow you like to
compare them. Things were thus going the
right way until some patriot put the cute little
Jap. on to the possibilities of this market for
pigs’ overcoats, and now consignments are
arriving cheaper and nastier than ever, and
local stuff will soon be where it was before
—in the background. By the way, we main-
tain our vandalistic tendencies here by not
skinning, but, instead, letting the hide go
with, the ham.

“H. 0.”: The land shark wears all sorts of
clothes. According to a member of the Yic.
Board of Health, Speculation in cemetery
lots is common aniong undertakers. The plan
is simple. Leading members of the cadaver
industry select a cemetery which they agree
to boom. They then buy up the most desir-
able grave sites, and, thus creating an artifi-
cial scarcity, bump up the price of a few
feet of earth for the dear departed as high
as £l2 12s. and £l3 13s.
A CORNER IN THE GRAVEYARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Undertakers are trafficking for gain in Melbourne
luburban cemetery lots.’’
The merry undertaker buys
A certain burial location;
He cuts it up, and low he lies
In covetous anticipation.
When you and I are safely dead
He’ll grind our bones to make his bread.
The goodly law in which supply
Advantage takes of all demand
Drives Coffin on. The more we die
The more we do enrich his land ;
And pound-notes spring up by the score
Where a mere handful grew before.
Yet Coffin does not stand alone,
For when at length we’ve sunk our all
In grave lots, and await the tone
Of Gabriel’s resurrection call,
Considered in an honest wise
We, too, are “holding for a rise.”

Advice to
Nursing Mothers
MANY mothers would like to feed their
own children, but are denied the privilege
of doing so, because they have not suffi-
cient nourishment for them. The “Allenburys”
scientific system of Infant Feeding has provided
for all this. When a mother is partly able to
feed her baby she may give The “Allenburys" Milk
Food No. I for alternate feeds, so alike are the
natural and prepared food in this instance, and this
food should be continued until the weaning process
has been entirely completed. The mother herself
must be well nourished and to this end may partake
freely of the “Allenburys" DIET a partially pre-
digested milk and wheaten food, which like the
Milk Food No. 1, is instantly made ready for use
by simply adding boiling water only. After
childbirth the “Allenburys" DIET is surprisingly
helpful in maintaining the strength and producing
a good flow of rich milk.

Rexona Soap Gives Natural Beauty to Skin#Hair
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained by
regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali', which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse, they cannot
heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains tJhe same soothing, healing antisep-
tic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin
affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap
regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the tendency to pimples and leave the complexion clear, fresh and
velvety. Price 1/- per tablet.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE wallowed in a sandy surf,
The sea beyond was blue;
Night rain had greened the happy turf
Hound that small bay we knew;
The sun upon the shining sand
Had pressed a hot December hand.
’Twas then we saw a dimpleti arm,
Out where the undertow
Waits the unwary wight to harm
By dragging him below
And heaping water on his head
Till he admits that he is dead.
Out where the greedy shark is wont
To wait and watch all day,
In hope to gather those who don’t
Object to be his prey,
’Twas there we saW that dainty limb
The top of one tall roller skim.
Beside the arm another rose,
And ’twixt the two a head,
Bright scarlet lips, a dainty nose,
And hair we thought was red,
But which upon a closer view
We found was golden through and through.
Arm over arm, she came right in,
Borne from the outer sea.
Now, in the name of socks and sin,
What sort of girl was she
To climb waves on our private beach
With a complexion like a peach?
Unless she dived out of a boat
Or from a steamer’s deck,
Or managed thus to shoreward float
From off a foundered wreck,
She must have travelled twenty miles,
Bearing that faceful of pink smiles.
One thing we saw beyond all doubt,
W T hate’er was left to guess:
All laws of decency to flout,
She wore no bathing dress;
She was as naked as the air
Except for her amazing hair.
Five large male persons in the sea,
Afar from friends and home;
And pink as apple-blossom she
Came splashing through the foam —
For even Manly, I suppose,
Had never seen such feet and toes.
Straight, as she, came, a warm breeze blew
Across the flashing wet,
Loaded with sweets that round her flew —
Musk-rose and mignonette—-
And as she came at last to land,
Flowers sprang and blossomed o’er the sand.
A thousand snowy doves came near
And fluttered round her head ;
A magic music sharp and clear
Before her ever fled;
And graciously on us she smiled,
While five assorted hearts went wild.
Our bathing-shed arose and stood
A hundred feet in air;
It changed its front of painted wood
To marble white and fair;
And where six narrow steps had been
A broad, bright flight of stairs was seen.
Down swept a troop of laughing girls
With mischief in their eyes—
Admitting that the sea has pearls,
It caused us some surprise
To see the land thus open out
And toss such jewellery about.
The world got very mad indeed
That bright December day....
The bright procession went with speed
And vanished quite away ;
And we, although we travelled light,
Could never keep the mob in sight.
Barefooted, burned with salt and sun,
We found ourselves at last
Upon a road that seemed to run
Right down into the past;
For tombstones stood round everywhere
Upended in the summer air.
We wandered back to find the sea;
And there the liquid flowed,
The white surf breaking fast and free
In tints of sunset glowed ;
And there the same old bathing-shed
Lifted its corrugated head.
Where had we wandered? Whither been?
No man of us could tell.
Each thought about that peachy queen
Who rose upon the swell;
Each would have sold his soul to win
The small, clear dimple on her chin.
We dressed in haste, we went to town
By that same evening’s train;
And there the woman-hater, Brown,
At once proposed to Jane ;
While, hanging on a tramway strap,
Smith threw his heart in Elsie’s lap.
Hobson, without an hour’s delay,
Went out to look for Kate,
Asked her to marry straight away
Across the garden gate;
And Jones, who held a barmaid dear,
Popped the soft question o’er a beer.
But, as for me, I turned once more
And journeyed to the sea.
Content to linger on the shore
With that bright memory ;
Hoping the moon when she arose
Might shine again on those pink toes.
I watched to see an arm arise
Amid the wild waves’ hiss,
To look again in those soft eyes,
Perchance those lips to kiss....
Lonely I marked the breaking foam—
You see, I had a wife at home.

PAT O’MAORI.
Pennyweight Regan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CAVAN PATRICK REGAN, known
on every mining-field from the Wood-
larks to Southern Cross as Penny-
weight Regan, gripped the rail with his
gnarled hands as the waving tops of the
cocoanut-palms rose above the sky-line. The
steamer was going half-speed, for here were
sharp, jagged reefs and treacherous sand-
banks’ but Regan didn’t notice it. He was
thinking of the good time he had had. His
one hundred and twenty ounces of hard-won
Yodda Valley gold had kept things moving
for over six weeks, and he thought with
pride that the burden of his sixty-nine years
hadn’t spoilt his ability to paint places red.
True, he had sent twenty ounces to his
hard-up sister in Sydney, but with the
remainder he had had one of the most
glorious bursts of his roaring, tearing life,
and Cooktown was not likely to forget him
in a hurry.
On every goldfield that had come into
existence within the last four decades Penny-
weight Regan was known for his habit of
arriving early. Whenever a new rush was
proclaimed he was sure to be with the first
bunches to arrive. He was in Perth when
Coolgardie started, and, though broke to the
world, he managed to reach Eldorado before
the crowd. He was one of the first diggers
at Ebagoolah and on the Batavia River,
away up near Cape York; and when the
news of the discovery of gold in the Yodda
Valley in New Guinea reached him, he
walked down the Peninsula to Cooktown,
went across to Port Moresby in a trading
cutter, and was off alone on the dangerous
short-cut across the wild mountain country
whilst others were still looking for carriers.
He was a little man, undersized, except in
breadth of shoulder, and fiery tempered.
Though he had lived through nearly seventy
years of hardships of all kinds, his back
was straight and his hair abundant and
only slightly tinged with grey. He had
very bright, observing grey eyes, and was
one of the shrewdest of prospectors.
His latest periodical burst was now over,
effects and all. The last fiver had been
cashed and the last jimjam had vanished
into the nothingness from which it had
sprung. But New Guinea tugged at his
heart-strings—which is a way that country
has —and now r . .as he stood looking with
unseeing eyes at the native canoes approach-
ing the steamer, and at the white sails of
a lugger in the harbor and the corrugated
roofs of Samarai’s assorted buildings gleam-
ing white in the sunlight, he was planning
a prospecting trip into the interior —the land
of mountains, mystery and death. As soon
as he was passed by the doctor, Pennyweight
ran down the gangway with the activity 6f
a youngster. His frame almost quivered, as
it had done many a time before, with the
excitement common to pioneers at the out-
set of their adventures. A brief interview
with a storekeeper gave him what he
wanted —to a clever prospector like Regan
credit was extended freely—and a week
later he and two natives landed at Cape
Nelson on the north-east coast.
For a fortnight nothing was heard of
him. Then one day a tale of a disabled
white man reached the magistrate at Cape
Nelson. The magistrate sent assistance, and
Pennyweight was carried to the coast with
an injured hip. He had fallen down an old
shaft, the mouth of which had been con-
cealed by the grass and bushes growing
about it.
Pennyweight took it philosophically. Right
through the journey on a little, dirty, cock-
roach-ridden cutter to Samarai, and from
Samarai to Thursday Island in the steamer,
he never grumbled or cursed his luck. But
when he lay in a nice white bed in the
hospital on the beach beneath the fort he
became anxious, and begged the nurses to
tell him the doctor’s opinion. They told
him at last. He would never walk again
without a crutch. Pennyweight tried to
accept his fate. But it was very hard. To
such a man physical inaction was repugnant.
He sat on the verandah and tried to appre-
ciate the beauties of the blue water and the
white beach and the verdure of Prince of
Wales Island. But it was no go. The
thought that he was useless for life when
there were years of active service still in
him crowded out everything else.
Three months dragged by. Then came
news of the discovery of a goldfield
away up near the head of the Richards
River, in the Gulf of Papua. Men were
flocking to New Guinea from all over Aus-
tralia —many never to return.
When old Pennyweight heard the news
he begged for his discharge from the hos-
pital ; and when it was refused on the
ground that he wasn’t fit to go, he
boldly packed his gear, seized his crutch and
stumped out. He was a passenger aboard
the steamer that left for New Guinea that
evening.
He disembarked at Port Moresby and
hurried along the jetty, as well as he could,
through the crowd of yabbering natives
working cargo—some of them women w r ith
piccaninnies on their backs. Once again he
secured credit at a New Guinea store. The
rush had come unexpectedly, and Moresby’s
stores were depleted of everything in the
nature of mining tools. Picks and shovels
were worth their weight in silver, and men
were stealing the circular iron caps from
the foundation-piles of houses for use as
prospecting dishes. But Regan had, with
the tradesman’s love of his tools, stuck to
his outfit through all the years. All he
needed was rations and “boys.” The latter
were the great difficulty; and Pennyweight
had almost decided to start off for the field
on his own when a crop-headed native halted
in front of him, and, removing a chew of
betelnut from his mouth, displayed an
array of red teeth in a smile.
“Pennyw’t, taubada !” he said.
The old prospector stopped. It was one
of the two boys who were with him when
he met with his accident.
“Hullo, Ivito,” he said. “What you do
here?”
“Me look round job,” answered Iv'ito.
“Maia him here, too.”
“All right.” said Regan, and that after-
noon he took them both up the hill to the

Directly Zam=Buk is applied to L wound or W

prevent the place “taking bad ways.” W
Zam-Buk also has splendid antiseptic W
properties. W
In a natural way belonging to the f
natural extracts from which it is /
manufactured, this balm stops i
the growth of harmful microbes /
that account for the festering /
of a neglected or wrongly /
treated sore, it kills or nul-
lifies all dangerous influ-

the tissues, which it
has first made clean
in a medical sense,
to knit together
once more until
all trace of the
sore or injury
has gone.

Poisoned Foot Healed.
Mrs. M. Dehon, who lives
at 53 Little Albion Street,
Surry Hills, Sydney, says:
“One day whilst crossing the
yard I slipped, and a rusty
nail penetrated my foot and
caused a painful '..jury. Within
a few days blood-poisoning set
in, and my foot a,nd leg began to
be extremely inflamed and swollen.
Night after night I would lie awake
in agony, and often the pain made me
cry out aloud. For some time I was
too crippled to get about, or do anything.
After reading about Zam-Buk I sent for
a large pot of the balm. I began to apply
dressings of Zam-Buk to the injury twice
daily, and it soon effected a noticeable im-
provement. My foot was freed of pain, the
swelling and inflammation were greatly reduced,
and the wound began to look a lot healthier.
“I persevered with Zam-Buk until the wound was
thoroughly rid of all bad matter, and then it healed
rapidly and perfectly. I cannot speak too highly
of Zam-Buk.”
For everyday skin sores, flesh wounds and injuries, Zam-
Buk is a reliable healer to keep always handy. Of all

OBTAINABLE EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT AUSTRALASIA.
Managing RALPH ABERCROMBY,
Denison House,
380-2 George Street, SYDNEY,
little wooden bungalow designated “Labor
Office,” and signed them on as laborers and
carriers.
Next day he started on the first stage Of
the. journey to the far-distant field. In a
native canoe with the south-east wind
behind him, he set out to cross the 140
miles of heaving Pacific which lay between
Moresby and the mouth of the Richards
River.
Even with a following wind the Gulf of
Papua is a nasty bit of water for voyaging
in in such a crazy craft as a native canoe.
The ill-named Pacific thereabouts consists
mainly of rollers which come up over the
horizon in never-ending succession and break
angrily on the beach. But for the skill of
Kito and Maia the whole outfit would have
been lost half a dozen times a day. The
canoe would stand poised on the summit of
a water mountain for a second and then
plunge into the abyss. Sometimes there
was a calm, and old Pennyweight, sitting on
an uncertain thwart, with his disabled leg
sticking straight out before him, would help
the two boys with the laborious work of
paddling.
They reached the mouth of the Richards
River one morning just as the big, round
sun showed its face amongst the mountain
peaks. Taking in the sail, Maia and Kito
paddled slowly just outside the outer
breakers, watching for a chance to get
through the everlasting line of foam. They
were waiting for a “smooth.” Suddenly
Maia cried sharply :
“Bara! Bara!” (Pull! Pull!)
On top of an enormous roller which
roared itself into foam under and just ahead
of the. canoe, the light craft shot ahead.
Then in obedience to another shout from
Maia, the paddles were reversed, and the
dugout stopped. They were now between
the outer and inner lines of surf. The same
waiting process was gone through again,
and on top of another roller, but just behind
the “break,” they glided at enormous speed
on to the white beach.
The Richards goldfield is situated six days’
journey up the winding, reeking, mangrove-
and nipa-f ringed river, from which it takes
its name. Because of its isolation, its sick-
ness and the hostility of the natives there-
abouts it was one of the most notorious
fields in New Guinea. Dysentery and black-
water fever played dreadful havoc. The
native laborers and carriers died in scores.
The place took its toll ■of Europeans also.
And there were not wanting good Austra-
lian women who went to this disease-stricken
spot as nurses. The names and deeds of
some of these brave women are engraved for
life upon the memory of many a New
Guinea digger.
Pennyweight arrived at the field little the
worse for his rough trip along the 1 coast and
up the river. His boys carried him in an
improvised stretcher over the ten miles from
the landing-place on the river bank to the
field.
“Gord’s truth! Is that you, Penny-*
weight?” asked a tall, gaunt, whiskered man
with skin the texture of parchment and the
color of a sovereign, when Regan climbed
out of the stretcher and picked up his
crutch. “What th’ hell are you going to do
here ?”
Pennyweight frowned and made no
answer. He told his boys to erect the tent.
“ S’pose they’re thinkin’ I’m too old, or
decrepit, or somethin’,” he muttered to him-
self. “I’ll show ’em.”
A few days later he pegged out a claim
in the gully over the ridge and started work.
The claim was a mile from the camp, but the
old man hobbled over the distance twice a
day. Kito and Maia did most of the hard-
est work, but Pennyweight did a share. Right
from the first his luck was in. As a result
of his first week’s work his “shammy” con-
tained 22 ounces.
Then his leg began to give trouble, and
one day he didn’t leave his camp till late in
the afternoon. When he reached the claim
•there was no sign of the two boys. He
shouted, but only the echoes answered. Right
in the bed of the gully he found Maia’s
body. It was stuck so full of arrows that
it looked like an enormous porcupine. And
behind some bushes near the head of the
sluice-box he found Kito lying on his back
staring straight up at the blue sky, with
the blood just beginning to congeal around
the haft of the arrow that pierced his heart.
It was the work of the Kuku-kukus—the
nomad savages who infest the whole country
on the upper waters of the Richards River.
Pennyweight stood leaning on his crutch
and cursed long and loudly. No thought of
his own danger came to him till a movement
across the gully not ten yards away attracted
his attention. Quick as thought he raised
his rifle and pressed the trigger. It stuck.
As is common in that damp climate, the
breech had become rusty and it had jambed.
A painted, befeathered savage jumped from
behind a clump of bushes and made for the
scrub. Pennyweight grabbed a heavy
double-ended pick that lay at his feet and
swung it round his head. Then with all
his force behind it he let it go. It went
circling through the air like a gigantic
Catherine wheel, and its sharpened point
struck the nigger in the back of the neck.
He fell, with a shriek, to the ground. Then
Itegan started off to the camp to inform the
magistrate-in-charge.
j To get more boys was impossible. The
' Government had stopped any further re-
; crikiting on account of the high mortality
; caused by the dysentery amongst the
_ natives, and nobody on the field had any to
! spare from their depleted numbers. So the
’ plucky old man worked alone at his claim
on a goldfield where sickness and death were
always at hand, and attack from hostile
natives an ever-present probability. The
other miners tried to dissuade him. They
even volunteered to work his claim for him.
But the old fellow’s independent spirit
refused all offers of assistance.
All offers except one. Among the hard-
i worked nursed there was a sallow, fever-
haunted girl, with pale golden hair, who
sometimes visited Regan’s camp and took
• him soup, or liniment for his leg. She was
the only person whom Regan permitted to
help him in any way.
Meanwhile his “shammy” was growing.
Being an early arrival on the field, he had
had choice of spots to work, and had
picked one which his experience told him was
one of the best. He pictured in his mind
the glorious time he was going to have when
he left the field in October, just before the
wet season made work impossible. It would
be nothing less than Sydney this time. He
had made half a dozen attempts in as many
years to get to Sydney, but, somehow, Thurs-
day Island or Cooktown had always pulled
him up. But he wasn’t going to make any
mistake this time. He hadn’t been going to
make any mistake many times before.
One evening about dusk it was noticed
that Pennyweight hadn’t returned to his
camp. He usually got home from the claim
about 5 o’clock. The man who noticed his
absence walked to the top of the ridge to
see if he could see the old man coming.
There was no sign, so he went back and
called the crowd.
It wasn’t hard to find Pennyweight. He
was- lying across his crutch on top of the
tailings heap in his claim. There was an
arrow through his chest, and he was trans-
fixed to the ground by the point of a pick
driven through the side of his neck. As the
men examined him for signs of life a harsh
laugh sounded from the top of the ridge, and
a war-painted savage leaped into view, slap-
ping his thighs in derision.
Long Horton, one of the old New Guinea
hands, lifted fils rifle and fired.
“This is your idea of revenge, I s’pose,” he
said. “Take that, y’ brute!”
The savage took “that”—in the centre of
the forehead.
Pennyweight wasn’t quite dead. Somebody
poured whisky down his throat, and he
opened his eyes. Ills lips moved. Horton
bent down and placed his ear close to.
“Th’ shammy,” whispered Regan. “Th’
shammy. Give it.... to th’ little... .nurse
....th’ one. .. .with th’ hair like.... poor
.... gold. Y’know—thirty-bob an ounce....
stuff. . . .light-colored. She.. . .gimme. .. .

off into eternal silence.

The Adventure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I MET him on a William-street tram.
That in itself should not be sufficient
introduction, but very often it is.
I think it was his red hair and beard that
first attracted my attention-—or perhaps it
was his persistent stare directed midway
between my skirt and ankles.
Whatever the cause, I became irresistibly
aware of his presence, his flaming hair and
beard. And then the left lid slowly slid over
his eye in a most insinuating manner.
Now, I hate red-haired men —being red-
haired myself—and I usually take pains to
avoid the color; but here was I actually
watching, with palpitating interest, the‘glad-
eye tactics of a red-haired man.
When I rose to leave the tram he did the
same, but as it was the section I Could not
justly suspect him of any ulterior motive.
So I walked leisurely towards my flat, con-
scious all the time that Red-beard was
behind me.
I could feel his presence down my spine,
and I didn’t like the sensation. I felt I
wanted to run away and to confront him at
the same time. Such feelings belong to very
salad days. I can’t be quite as old as I feel.
I felt strangely excited, and if his foot-
steps had stopped, or if he had turned down
any side street, I should have been keenly
disappointed.
The brilliant idea struck me to go beyond
my own door and then turn back so as to
pass him.
I executed this manoeuvre with a loudly-
beating heart. As I came alongside him,
again that left eyelid performed its sly little
trick. I ought to have had sufficient pre-
sence of mind to return the salutation, but
for some reason I felt as shy as a schoolgirl
on her first mash. I just hurried into my
own gate, leaving it conveniently open.
My key seemed to share my nervousness
and would not fit the lock. But still he did
not come. So I had to open the door and
enter. A little peep as I closed it revealed
that he had not turned back.
I went up to my flat feeling ready to cry,
wishing I had had my accustomed self-
possession in dealing with similar situations.
For a few minutes I waited impatiently,
and at last rose, determined to go out again
and, if he were still about, manage the
affair with more finesse.
As my hand was on the door to open it
someone knocked, and the maid’s voice told
me a gentleman wished to see me.
Then I knew he had come.
I threw open the door, trying to appear
calm and self-possessed.
He was there —red hair, red beard and
glad eye. I smiled an invitation to enter,
which he accepted with another salutation
from his left eye.
“I knew you’d come,” I said. “I knew it
in the tram. Why didn’t you speak to me
in the street?”
He smiled. “It has to be done where no
interruptions can come. I thought it safer
to wait till you reached your rooms.”
“How nice of you,” I said, now thoroughly
enjoying my own novel sensations of ner-
vousness, apprehension and delightful antici-
pation.
It’s an old game, but somelio# his red
beard seemed to add a dash of flavor other
adventures had lacked.
“Well, now,” he said, sitting down and
taking some papers from his pocket. “Let us
get this matter finished, and then perhaps
we can have a little chat about more pleas-
ant things.”
I was puzzled, but waited for him to
explain.
“I suppose you have been expecting this
for some time,” he said, looking up from the
papers he was unfolding.
I was now properly mystified, and shook
my head in a non-committal manner.
“One does not always get what one
expects.” I said.
“Well. I guess you’ll get a little more in
this instance.” He then cleared his throat
and proceeded to read from the paper in his
hand :—
“Subpoena in the case of Dove versus
Dove, Carmen Doree co-respondent.”
I think that is where I fainted.
