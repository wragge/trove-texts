It only took about 5000° F to
'weld' this meteorite into shape.
That's the temperature reached by
meteorites, missiles and machines entering
our atmosphere. But let's get down to earth.
Arc welding requires a lot more heat.
Around 10,000°F. And it's a lot more
convenient. Arc welding has modernized
thought and action. See how it has caused
changes in design and manufacture in every
phase of engineering. Today's oil finds, for
instance, are being stored in tanks of all-
welded construction. Pipelines and ships,
bridges and automobiles EMF arc
welding makes it happen. Improved EMF
arc welding electrodes are also on the job.
In giant manufacturing plants and small
factories... used by tradesmen and handy-
men. With new metals and new techniques
appearing every day, we are engaged in a
continual programme of testing and
research. And if ever the day comes that
some new process replaces arc welding
...you'll hear about it first from us.

PENFOLDS Minchinbury makes it memorable
1
It’s cheaper. That’s because
it’s made quickly in big tanks with
extra yeast introduced
to speed up the fermentation.
Admittedly, it pops like real
champagne and it almost
bubbles like real champagne.
(But have you ever noticed
how fast it goes flat.) In fact,
if we didn’t point it out you might
think it was the Real McCoy.
Until you tasted it.
_ Sham
champagne
or PENF®LDS
Minchinbury?
Minchinbury is made by the classic
champagne method—in the bottle.
No big-tank, forced fermentation.
At Minchinbury, we let nature
take care of the fermentation
and the long, slow maturation to
give the crisp bubbly taste
that’s the sign of a great champagne.
And because of this slow
natural process, Minchinbury costs
you a little more. But come now,
it’s Christmas, isn’t it?

A GOOD TIME
AT THE
OLD 'GABBA
THE OLD ’GABBA Cricket Ground is
almost a mirror of Brisbane itself
blowsy, quite hideous, terribly sub-
standard, yet in a way possessing real
character. There is a modern Cricketers’
Club where one can watch the game
through plateglass windows, but what
else? The Melbourne Cricket Ground
recently pulled down a grandstand far
better than anything possessed by the
’Gabba.
However, it is superior to the MCG
in one respect: it doesn’t look like a
place designed for eating Christians.
There are some poincianas which, at
First Test time, are always a gorgeous
blaze of red, and around the outer there
are a dozen great Moreton Bay figs.
One can only say that the atmosphere
is somewhat different from Lord’s. Most
people go along in shorts and bare
feet, and seeing that there are no seats
in the outer, and precious little grass,
it is wise to arrive as if one were camp-
ing at Rosebud, with seats, cushions,
rugs, provisions, even a tent.
This year the Queensland Cricket
Association tried to give a little tone
to the place. For one thing, they in-
stalled pretty young ladies in green
mini-skirts to act as ushers (reserved
seat department only). They looked
charming enough, but their skirts were
not brief enough either to distract one’s
attention from the cricket or to attract
one to the ’Gabba for that reason alone.
For another thing, all around the
outer they installed rotary clotheslines
covered with canvas. Your correspon-
dent felt that they couldn’t be there
entirely through the generosity of the
QCA, because they were labelled “Hills
Hoist Descendamatic.” The fortunate
were able to sit in the shade under
their descendamatics and even hang
out their personal washing, but for any-
one else who wanted to sit behind they
completely blocked the view.
There are areas of vital importance
in the outer. The most vital is under
the Moreton Bay figs near the school.
Here the bars are located and the area
is known as “Cannery Row.” The can
per head consumption here would be
more splendid than at any cricket
ground in Australia. The pile outside
one descendamatic, we noted, reached
57 cans. The cans are not rip top,
and they have a man there who does
nothing else but work a primitive gad-
get, which we used to see at football
matches, piercing cans.
On Sunday, Dece’mber 8, we had the
first Sunday’s play in the history of
Australian Test cricket. Therefore, the
bars out there in Cannery Row were all
closed. Can you appreciate the agony
of this? All those who wished to drink
beer had to cart it in, and one felt
sympathy for them over the terrible
loads they had to carry. The mobs
walking in carrying their car fridges
looked like safaris carrying provisions
into the jungle, bearing their only sus-
tenance for the next six months. Not
only were there car fridges, but also
the occasional plastic rubbish-bin full
of cans and ice, and one gentleman used
a porter’s trolley to bring in his cartons.
It was a magnificent Test match. It
took one a little time to get used to
the idea that it would be practically
all spinners, with captains virtually
dying to take the old ball. So the start
of the game did not have the same
high drama. Ray Lindwall used to be
terribly good at psychological warfare:
he used to go through awe-inspiring
exercises at the wicket, to give the bats-
man a proper sense of approaching
doom.
There was none of this, but the battles
between the great spinners on either
side were absorbing. John Gleeson was
our star. He pushes the ball through
much faster than you would expect, and
he takes a run as long as Alan Connolly.
He is bandy, round-shouldered, and he
has the craggy, almost unbelievably
Australian face so adored by Albert
Tucker. He is a very great spin bowler,
but, if one could offer a word of criti-
cism, he needs coaching from a famous
“Today is the first Sunday of Test
cricket, and it’s Gibbs bowling to Lawry
Let us pray!”
thespian like Freddie Trueman. When
he has acquired a true sense of drama,
he will fill Cannery-Hills-Hoist Row
to capacity.
The new West Indian star is Clive
Lloyd. In the field he throws the most
fascinating silhouettes with extraordin-
ary leaps and brilliant throws. As a
batsman, for the entire season he had
been a disaster. He came to the wicket
wearing rimless professorial spectacles,
cap pulled down, and all the correctness
of dress one would see in a boy playing
in his first school match. He hit
successive fours off Mallett and Gleeson.
Also he straight drove Mallett for six
beside the scoreboard. Only when he
was in his 90s did the schoolboy
nervousness return. He couldn’t stand
still, he scratched himself, he gardened
the wicket as if he were planting cab-
bages, and he took an eternity to get
the last ten runs.
One remembers, too, lan Chappell.
He hasn’t the scrupulous style of Paul
Sheahan, or the straight-backed mag-
nificence of Garfield Sobers, but he has
power. He loves the pull, the cross-bat
blast to the boundary, and the huge
off-drive. It is interesting that a man
who two years ago was looked upon
mainly as a useful all-rounder is now
our number-one batsman, and promising
to become the greatest of his genera-
tion.
The QCA had signs around Brisbane
welcoming all to “champagne cricket”
and the world’s greatest cricket contest.
On the first day the crowd was 8500,
on the Saturday 13,800, on the historic
Sunday 11,612, and on Tuesday 6514.
This made a total attendance for a
world championship—a match described
by Sobers as one of the greatest he had
played in—of 40,426. A city with more
than 600,000 people should be able to
do better than that in one day, and one
wonders how long Brisbane can con-
tinue to support a Test match.
Yet, your correspondent wouldn’t miss
his trips to the ’Gabba. There’s a lovely,
easy-going charm about the place. At
Melbourne there are always 100 brood-
ing policemen. Here there are no restric-
tions. At lunch, tea, stumps, everybody
jumps the fence and wanders over to
the Test wicket, and the enthusiasts
even walk on it. They stand, looking in
awe at the cracked, dusty thing, which
was described by commentators at
various stages as this “dull,” “moody,”
“mystery,” “vicious,” “chaotic,” and
even “sullen” pitch. It is always inter-
esting to note that the black soil comes
from Goodna, the home of the local
asylum. That might explain something.
But one piece of color has gone from
the ’Gabba. Railway trains always used
to cross the Woolloongabba intersection.
They used to have an Emmet steam
engine, a character used to walk in
front waving a red flag and ringing a
bell. The custom should have been
preserved for ever as a tourist attrac-
tion. I mean, the MCG is hopeless at
turning on anything as good as that.

GIVING THEM
CURRY IN DARKEST
CREMORNE
“ ’ERE,” SAYS STUART, the Scots
waiter, born and bred in Australia, he’s
never seen haggis in his life, “ ’ere, are
they real, them girls, are they real?”
Dawn sends him a look over N.S.W.
Minister for Health, the Hon. Arnold
Jago’s grey-suited shoulder, that is guar-
anteed to transport him slowly to the
depths of hell, where he can fry to
within an inch of his life, then snatch
him up and apply the snap-frozen treat-
ment. For someone to send sea mail
back to his northern relatives, where
they can keep him on the mantelpiece
for ever.
Dawn is a sexy Indian girl from
Bombay, now resident in Sydney, and
imported on this occasion with three
colleagues from the East India Restaur-
ant, Brookvale, to serve a champagne-
and-curry lunch to VIPs in the throb-
bing suburb of Cremome. In the new
Cremome Shopping Centre, actually,
which is another of those aweful build-
ings Australians are so fond of erecting.
What it is all in aid of is the opening
of Tiger and Doris Ady’s Burra Bazaar
Doris Ady serves a spoonful of curry
for the Minister for Health, Mr. Jago
and the launching of Doris’ cookery
book “Curries From the Sultan’s Kit-
chen.” Of course Dawn is real. So is
Tina, from Calcutta, now Beacon Hill.
And another Dawn, late of Ceylon, now
Kingswood. Dawn, from Bombay, is get-
ting pretty tired telling people how
many saris she owns. She’s already said
30. Tina has a miniscule four. Dawn
II has 25. June from Chats-
wood, a 100 percent Australian girl, has
six. June has also got something the
others haven’t: a toe-ring from Grace
Bros. And a marvellous Edwardian
curled red false-piece, which adds a
clear foot to her stature.

Burra Bazaar downstairs. It is a tiny
shop. Cheek-by-jowl the guests stand,
nibbling Peppi-Peppers and Cheeki-
Chillis, which, points out Trixie, one
of Doris’ cohorts, are all for sale on
the shelves. Along with Tiger’s own
branded South - East Asian lines,
Indonesian sambals, pronounced with
much lip movement and meaning
accompaniments to a curry, and
Javanese curries which are quite differ-
ent, says Doris, with a slight inflection
of superiority, from Indian curries.
Well, they use a lot of peanuts and
coconut milk. Indians use yoghurt and
sour cream. There are Chinese lines and
a few Continental biscuits thrown in for
the more mundane taste, and in one
corner a display of Lipton’s teabags.
Very suitable for people who live on
their own.
John Reed, Doris’ publisher, is
talking. He reckons that half the people
who buy some books don’t open them.
That’s if they’re personality books.
Doris’, on the other hand, is a
speciality book and made with a spiral
spine for easy manoeuvring in that
slavehole called the kitchen, where Mr.
Reed has worked out that wo’men cook
three meals a day, seven days a week
he’s got the answer to that one
in his office somewhere ■ — and they
might as well be pleasant ones. Mrs.
Cyril Pearl is leaning against the
sambals and saying she has already
got a Wok, bigger than that, for
cooking her veg the Chinese way, she
doesn’t want another. Mr. Pearl sips
champagne silently. Del Cartwright in
black and white, a sort of uniform for
lady journalists this season, asks sotto
voce has it been printed that Tiger
was a former millionaire? Er yes,
’fraid so. Many, many times.
Restaurateur Johnny Walker can’t
remember the name of a Cordon Bleu
bearing down on him in pink silk.
Quick. What is it? Too late. Johnny,
how lovely to see you. Peter Bergen’s
doom'-ridden Channel 10 commercial
voice is doing Santa Claus imperson-
ations. John H. Lester, an American
Dale Carnegie instructor, says meek-
and-mild or hellish-hot makes no
difference. All curries paralyse his
throat. “Well, it’s getting warm,”
announces Tiger, “let’s cool down in
the Function Roo’ms.”
So upstairs past Kentucky Fried
Chicken made to Colonel Sanders’
Recipe, past Dan’s Pet and Fish
Emporium and half a dozen other
shops crammed with gay ideas for
Christmas gifts guaranteed to please,
if not, hard luck, nothing’s exchange-
able, and through to the Function
Rooms, where June pats her false piece
and tucks her blue sari down a shade
tighter. This one’s acksherly one she ran
up herself, a few yards of stuff from
the shop up the road, and that’s it. The
Function Rooms are close-curtained,
brown, and air-conditioning blows blue
tinsel decorations. Tiger, a former
General Wingate Chindit officer, issues

Ross Campbell
FOR SWAP OFT
LOSES BOTH ITSELF
AND FRIEND
THE REV. ROGER BUSH, of Syd-
ney, lately drew attention to the fact
that the fashionable practice known
as wife-swapping has spread to Aus-
tralia. I say “known as” wife-swapping
because the term is not accepted by
everyone as correct. A wife with whom
I discussed it objected to its overtones
of male domination. It implies, she
said, that the husband is the swapper
and the wife the swapped. She argued
that the arrangement could be des-
cribed with equal logic as husband-
swapping.
- This is a reasonable complaint.
Successful swapping requires as a rule
that the wives actively participate and
are not passively swapped. However,
I do not propose to pursue this
semantic dispute, and for convenience
shall use the more common term.
The world centre of wdfe-swapping,
by repute, is the prosperous suburban
area outside New York City. As well
as providing communal entertainment
it supplies material for novels
which are written by most of the
inhabitants. The vogue of the custom
owes much to the publicity it has
received in fiction.
This promotional literature, none the
less, is open to the same criticism as
most books on cricket, golf, and other
sports: it makes the thing seem too
easy. Often one encounters people who
are anxious to keep up with contem-
porary trends, and have made an
honest endeavor to begin wife-swapping,
but have not been able to arrange it.
The Rev. Roger Bush, although unsym-
pathetic to the practice, surprisingly
omitted to emphasise its inherent diffi-
culties.
These are the same ones commonly
met with in transactions by barter, as
explained in elementary textbooks on
economics. Say a farmer, in some very
underdeveloped country which does not
use money and has not thought of
getting it from the U.S.A., has a
surplus goat and wishes to barter it
for a dog. He has to find a neighbor
who not only has a surplus dog but
wishes to acquire a goat. Moreover,
for the deal to go through, the dog
and the goat must be of equal value.
The would-be wife-swapper, like-
wise, has to contact someone else who
wants to swap a wife; and if it is to
be a fair exchange the wives must
be of equal desirability. There is an
additional problem not encountered by
the bartering peasants of the textbooks.
The goat and the dog have no say
in the arrangements, but the wives do.
Not infrequently a swap is sabotaged
at the last moment by this factor. In
a case that came to my notice, Mr. A.
had everything teed up for a swap with
Mr. B. To his annoyance, Mrs. A. said:
“I don’t want Mr. B. His beard repels
me. I want Mr. C.” But Mr. A. detested
Mrs. C., who had sneered at his car;
so all swaps were off.
A few junior executive groups try
to get around these difficulties by
establishing wife-pools. But even in
smoothly functioning organisations
hitches are apt to occur. In one of
them a Mrs. D. and Mr. E. became too
interested in each other. They insisted
on going off by themselves, despite
much criticism of their lack of team
spirit.
In the nature of things some people
are less fortunately placed than others
for wife-swapping. For example, Mr.
F., a solicitor, was married to a lady of
severe appearance who had a critical
way of talking. He had more reason
than most for wanting to swap, but
whenever he suggested it at parties his
friends made some excuse to decline
the offer.
He had no success until he
approached Mr. G., a young business-
man. Mr. G. had a charming wife; also,
he owed Mr. F. $lOO in conveyancing
fees. He agreed, with some misgivings,
to an exchange of wives. Mr. F. found
the arrangement very satisfactory. But
Mr. G. complained afterward that he
had been cheated, and refused to pay
Mr. F. his debt of $lOO.
Because of ill-feeling of this kind,
some Sydney couples decline to take
part in wife-swaps at all, even at the
risk of being dropped by their social
circle. Husbands may occasionally
borrow or lend a wife, but they cannot
be bothered with the complexities of
swapping.
My information from America is that
wife-swapping there is losing ground to
more advanced, efficient systems such
as the Rent-A-Wife organisation. This
enables a husband travelling interstate
to arrange for a smartly uniformed wife
to meet him at the airport. Australia,
as usual, lags behind.

Comment by ‘Observer'
STUPID VOTERS? — OR STUPID POLITICS?
IT IS A HUMDRUM enough assump-
tion that the ideal that an elected
government should faithfully and
accurately reflect the wishes of the
people it governs is merely an ideal.
That is to say it is not human, except
in the form of human aspiration: it does
not describe anything that happens,
except in hope, and, from what we
know of ourselves as a species, it does
not describe anything that is ever likely
to happen.
It is merely frivolous to judge politi-
cal events by such an unrealisable ideal.
Instead, someone who is serious about
democracy concerns himself with a
critical evaluation of various kinds of
second-bests. It is from this point of
view that it is interesting to look at last
week’s results in the N.S.W. local gov-
ernment elections.
If democracy is considered merely as
a ritual, the elections were a disaster.
There was the N.S.W. Government
removing the requirement that it was
compulsory for people 'to vote in local
government elections. So what did the
people of N.S.W. do? Most of them
didn’t vote. In a few rare areas a bit
more than 50 percent voted, but most
areas were below the pass mark and
some scored as little as 17 percent.
Does this matter? If you look at
democracy from the viewpoint of its
reflection of the people’s wishes prob-
ably not. People’s wishes in local gov-
ernment affairs are usually not even
politicised. There is not usually any
concept of issues as being connected
with groups of contestants for office.
Even when political parties are there in
name (mainly the Labor Party) they
are there as parties that contest State
and Federal elections, but not usually as
parties that reflect a division on local
government issues. It is not primarily
a reflection of the stupidity of voters
that local government elections are
often uninteresting, but of the stupidity
of local government politics.
How does compulsory voting change
this situation? Usually not at all. Faced
with a fine, people just troop along to
the polls and vote in a manner that,
statistically, is more or less probable.
From a series of random, accidental
decisions some kind of pattern emerges.
Is this one of democracy’s great
triumphs?
It is possible to imagine one situation
in which compulsory voting could be
important to democracy (if by democ-
racy one means a system of expressing
the popular voice): that would be a
situation in which the majority of voters
really cared about something and on
this matter there was a clear division
between the groups of candidates so that
effective choice was possible but at the
same time the voters’ interest in this
subject was not so great that it drove
them to the polls. Under such a situa-
tion compulsory voting could be said
to have produced a more accurate
expression of the popular will than
voluntary voting. But how often does
this situation exist?
People often care about local govern-
ment more than their voting scores
might suggest. Their problem is that
their particular cares have no particular
political expression. In such a case the
classic none of the bastards are any
good represents a shrewd and percep-
tive judgment.
From this point of view there is an
advantage in voluntary voting. In last
week’s N.S.W. results there were six
cases in which the voters tipped out
their old council on specific issues. In
each of these cases groups of people
who wanted changes were able to put
up their case and gain the support of
interested parties. If voting had still
been compulsory the apathetic habits
of the majority of the voters might
have defeated them. But, operating in a
smaller and more changeable lelector-
ate, they were able to prevail. In some
ways compulsory voting can be simply
a way of reinforcing the status quo. All
that it means is that those voters whose
apathy has now been attacked because
they didn’t vote would have been forced
to vote. But it would have been their
apathy that would have been doing the
voting.
If we gave up compulsory voting in
even Federal elections, what might
happen? Given the greater tendency of
Australians (perhaps because of their
more democratic preferential system of
voting) to go beyond the simple two-
party systems of Britain and America,
we might find that new parties could
emerge more successfully. This might
not be a bad thing. There would
certainly be considerable difficulty in
arguing that it would be an undemo-
cratic thing.
But, so far as local government
elections are concerned, the greatest
reform might be to introduce the
referendum as a more regular feature
of elections. In an age of increased
affluence, local government is going to
become more important, because the
choices available will increase. How
about making the choices specific, so
that voters can vote on them? Even
those who see democracy as a kind of
box-office affair, judged by attendances
at the polls, should welcome a move
that would increase attendances.
Comment by Alan Reid
CLEAR, PRECISE DECISIONS, PLEASE?
FORMER LABOR Prime Minister Ben
Chifley usually described the hip pocket
as the most sensitive nerve in the human
body. Overseas capital is reputed to be
the most sensitive section of that sensi-
tive nerve.
If these assessments are correct, the
statement made by Western Australian
Development Minister Charles Court is
highly important. Court, visiting Can-
berra last week to confer with the
National Development Department,
said that the Western Australian Gov-
ernment was finding Prime Minister
Gorton’s statement on overseas capital
“embarrassing.”
He (Court) believed that the Prime
Minister and he had basically the same
outlook on foreign capital. Both agreed
that Australia needed the “risk” capital
which would develop the ports, railways,
and other facilities through which Aus-
tralian iron and other resources would
find an outlet to world markets.
But there was a danger that these
people might think that Gorton’s super-
ficially anti-foreign investment state-
ments might apply to them, even
though they were providing risk capital,
Court said. A number of overseas inves-
tors had asked him what were the inten-
tions of the Federal Government, as
far as they were concerned, in view of
Gorton’s statements.
As a mishandling of the situation
could present Australia with an unneces-
sary overseas currency problem, Court’s
views merit Commonwealth examina-
tion. The one thing that emerges from
any examination of overseas capital in
an Australian context is that the view
of practically everyone who has studied
the situation is that Australia needs a
significant capital inflow for at least
some years to come.
While Treasury’s estimate that Aus-
tralia will be less dependent upon capi-
tal import by the mid-1970s might be
over-optimistic (it depends on whether
Australia’s developmental ambitions
expand to a degree that the local
savings are absorbed), nevertheless it is
a pointer to the fact that Australia will
become less vulnerable in its reliance
upon overseas capital within a discern-
ible period.
Deputy Prime Minister and Trade
Minister John McEwen has been a
persistent critic of the Government’s
“open door” policy on overseas capital
intake. He has grumbled that this is the
equivalent to “selling a bit of the farm
each year.” But, pointing out that with
capital inflow excluded Australia’s
balance of payments is adverse to the
extent of $lOOO million a year, McEwen
conceded in his recent address to the
Country Party’s Federal Council that,
“within limits,” Australia must have it.
What Gorton is aiming at is clear. He

wants to protect significant and efficient
Australian industries from overseas
takeovers, particularly when those take-
overs do not add a more efficient man-
agement or new know-hows to the Aus-
tralian economy.
He does not want to protect inef-
ficient Australian industries that could
benefit from an infusion of efficient
management, new valuable capital, and
fresh knowhow. Nor does he want to
provide a home in Australia for over-
seas capital that is content merely to
come to Australia without introducing
new techniques, and relies simply upon
a growth-rate to which it contributes
nothing.
But his statements of his intentions
are by no means clear, and the actions
which he takes to implement his inten-
tions have contradictory aspects. For
instance, he acknowledged to a Press
conference last week that if the Stock
Exchanges agreed to his request to list
and deal in shares in Australian com-
panies that have in their articles of
association rules cutting down the vot-
ing rights of shares held overseas, he
would be protecting inefficient Aus-
tralian companies—something which it
might be undesirable to do—along with
efficient and significant Australian
companies.
He also agreed that the actions he
had taken in protecting the MLG
against overseas takeover, and the move
to limit the voting rights of shares held
overseas, represented a departure from
the former “open-door” policy on capi-
tal inflow; whereas, it could be more
accurately described, with a lesser
impact upon the sensitive nerves of
overseas investors, as a further modi-
fication of the “open-door” thesis.
Actually, the Government has modi-
fied the “open-door” policy on a previ-
ous occasion. It did this when it
restricted capital-raising through deben-
ture issues in Australia by overseas
interests.
Court obviously agrees with Gorton’s
basic approach to the problem. What
troubles him is not the approach but
the way Gorton is going about making
it. Court has a very real interest in
this matter. Western Australia is boom-
ing. But Western Australia is very
dependent on risk capital, and risk
capital is not available in Australia. The
Gove decision shows that.
What Court clearly wants Gorton to
do is to explain his decisions—which
without explanation seem too ad hoc,
spur of the moment, and anti-overseas
investment—ir a context which explains
unmistakably that the Government’s
basic policy has not changed and that
it is welcoming to Australia capital
that brings with it managerial skills,
knowhow, and development projects.
As I see it, it would be in Gorton’s
and Australia’s advantage if Gorton
heeded the Court warning and made a
consistent attempt to fit such decisions
into a framework that more adequately
indicated the Commonwealth’s attitude
toward overseas capital.

COURTROOM DRAMA
THE SHOW as they are always saying,
had to go on. A couple of hours after
failing in a New South Wales Supreme
Court libel action against Mirror News-
papers Ltd. last week, actor Peter
O’Shaughnessy was performing in his
production of a recital of Christmas
carols and poems in Scots Church,
Sydney. A few days later he flew to
Melbourne to read poetry at a cultural
seminar; this week he joins the unit
making the film “Return Of The
Boomerang,” in which he has a substan-
tial role. Beyond that, he has no certain
plans. He said last week he intended to
take some further action “not neces-
sarily by appeal; I might pursue the
matter in another Staie.” He also is
considering the possibility of going to
England “although that would mean
selling the house and so on.”
The five-day hearing of his libel suit
brought out a fair sprinkling of theatre
and TV people as spectators, but as a
courtroom drama it lacked the tight-
editing and histrionics of familiar
fictions. The seats were hard, the acous-
Mr. Peter O’Shaughnessy . . . show
goes on
tics were bad, and there were long legal
arguments over what could and could
not be admitted as evidence.
O’Shaughnessy’s action arose out of
a review in “The Australian” by theatre
critic Katharine Brisbane of his pro-
duction of Shakespeare’s “Othello” in
Sydney in October, 1967. At the begin-
ning of the hearing, Mr. Clive Evatt,
QC (for O’Shaughnessy), handed each
member of the 12-man jury a copy of
the newspaper carrying the review, and
the brief difficulty of handling a broad-
sheet in a jury box would not have
gone unnoticed by the publishers of
tabloids.
By the begining of the fifth day the
jury had had plenty of opportunity to
memorise the review word for word, so
often was it quoted. Mr. Evatt said the
review had held Mr. O’Shaughnessy up
to the public as a man so bereft of
honor and integrity that he would be
a party to dishonesty in presenting the
play. Mirror Newspapers claimed the
review was fair comment on a matter
of public interest and that the material
was true and published for the public
benefit.
At first, it seemed as if the legalities
of discovering as Mr. Justice Taylor
put it “what went on that night on
stage” would prolong the hearing
through the sheer difficulty of obtaining
admissible evidence on the nature of. a
bygone performance. One attempt
began with O’Shaughnessy starting to
describe “Othello” scene by scene as a
radio commentator might describe a
procession, but after a minute or two
he stopped and said, “Really, this will
take me about two hours if I keep
going.”
By the last day of the hearing, the
court seemed more comfortably familiar
with theatre and its terminology than
it had been at the beginning when
counsel seemed to grope for suitable
metaphors sport seemed a favorite
frame of reference and when terms
such as “upstaged” and names such as
that of F. R. Leavis needed footnoting.
The jury took three hours and twenty
minutes to find that the review had
defamed Mr. O’Shaughnessy but that it
was fair comment on a matter of public
interest, so the verdict went to the
defence.
O’Shaughnessy left the court with his
actress wife, Shirley, who had attended
every day, and made his way to Scots.
Church for his previously arranged per-
formance of “The Feast of Christmas.”
The first performance was attended by
only one Sydney theatre critic.

IMAGINATIVE PLAN
THE SYDNEY Arts Foundation, the
group which wants to turn the Queen
Victoria Building into an arts centre
with the money from the $1,900,000
Seymour Bequest, is moving into the
high-powered stage of its campaign.
Details of the proposal have been set
out in a lavishly designed and printed
folio full of diagrams, illustrations, and
the committee’s plans for “the integra-
tion of the arts.” These have been sent
to the Trustees of the Bequest, the
N.S.W. Government, the City Com-
missioners, retailers in the area around
the building, and cultural groups. At
this point, the committee’s objective is
a public debate to discuss the question
of what’s to be done with the Seymour
Bequest, since claims to it have come
from several quarters.
According to Mrs. Mary White, the
interior decorator who first thought of
using the Queen Victoria Building as
an arts centre, “The Power Department
of Fine Arts at the University of Sydney
has put in a bid for it, because it wants
to enlarge the department; Professor
Robert. Quentin has presented a claim
for it for NIDA; and the State Govern-
ment is putting in for it to do up the
Conservatorium.”
Under the terms of the will of the
late Everest York Seymour, who died
in 1966, the money was left for the
purchase or construction of a building
in the city of Sydney, to be used as “a
centre for the cultivation, education,
and performance of musical and dram-
atic arts befitting the City of Sydney.”
It was to be vested “in the Council
of the Municipality of the City of
Sydney, or the University of Sydney, or
the N.S.W. Government, or in such
other Public Authority as my Trustees
shall consider fit.” In January, 1968,
the City Commissioners declined the
gift, saying it “was not by any means
the body best suited for carrying out
the terms of the will,” and Mrs. White
and Sydney architect Bill Lucas set to
work on their Queen Victoria Building
scheme.
The Foundation’s most powerful


argument is that there is no focus for
the arts in Sydney efforts are frag-
mented, and communication between
art, theatre, film and music groups is
limited. The Centre, it maintains, could
provide theatres, as well as a library
and other educational facilities
“separate from the universities and the
Education Department (but in co-
operation with them).” Its architectural
plan for the QVB is one presented by
the Archanon Group of architects last
year, when the National Trust proposed
that the building should be renovated
rather than demolished.
“We want to bring the whole question
before the public,” says Mrs. White,
“and fight this concept of the arts
being shut away from reality.”
Ideally, the Foundation would like
to become a statutory body. It calcu-
lates that the Bequest would cover the
cost of renovating the QVB, then the
running costs would be financed by
Government and Council grants, public
subscriptions, and participants’ fees
invested at fixed interest.
The Foundation has already made
a start with these kind of practicalities.
In addition to the submissions, they’ve
sent out membership forms to prospec-
tive supporters of the scheme, and those
who join the Foundation are asked to
contribute a membership fee of $5.
MOVING ALONG
THE NEVER-ENDING task of mak-
ing things sound better goes on: Mr.
Alexander Rhea, the new American
head of GM-H, said after receiving his
Victorian driving licence that he had
once had a parking ticket but had never
had a “moving violation.” Cars, we
must realise, no longer speed; they just
move along.
SUMMER SCHOOL
POVERTY will be the subject under
discussion at this year’s summer school
of the Institute of Political Science, to
be held in Canberra from January 25
to 27. The irony of large numbers of
well-fed people spending a pleasant
weekend in Canberra working out who
is poor and how poor they are may
not be lost on many pensioners and
people on low incomes. However, the
less that is known about poverty the
less, it seems, is likely to be done about
it.
It is only two years ago that a pre-
vious Federal Minister for Social
Services claimed that his Government
felt it improper to study poverty in
Australia, because it would mean prying
into the affairs of people concerned.
However, this excessive delicacy of
feeling—or callousness, whichever way
you regard it—is something of a luxury
to those who are poor, and is not main-
tained by the present Minister, Mr.
W. C. Wentworth, who will be a speaker
at the summer school.
The aims of the school are to make
it clear who are the poor in Australia,
how many they are, to look at the
causes of poverty and the ways t>f
preventing it, and to discuss the politi-
cal aspects of the question. Mr.
Wentworth will speak on “Poverty and
Affluence”; Professor David Donnison,
of the London School of Economics,
will present a paper on world poverty;
and Miss Janet Paterson, of the Brother-
hood of St. Laurence, will discuss what
can be done about it.
UP IN ARMS
NOTHING UNITES a community
quite as effectively as adversity in the
shape of one of the N.S.W. State
Planning Authority’s development
schemes. We’ve had the Battle of Pad-
dington, waged against the proposal to
send arterial highways ripping through
one of Sydney’s last havens for Vic-
toriana. Now the front has moved
across the harbor to Hunters Hill,
whose residents are already involved in
their stand against the home-unit
invasion.
As if that skirmish wasn’t enough
to occupy one neighborhood, the SPA
is considering the construction of an
expressway along the western fore-
shores of the Lane Cove River, and
the district’s residents have formed a
defensive band called the Save the
Lane Cove Valley Committee. The
idea of an expressway is not new. The
SPA, residents believe, has been con-
sidering it for 17 years, but the express-
way was to follow a different route, a
ridge through West Lane Cove, one
which would not bring it in contact
with bushland reserves.
“There seems to be a certain cyni-
cism about reserved land,” the commit-
tee’s secretary, Mrs. Sheila Swain, told
us. “The authorities seem to think
they can hold it for a while, then use
it for whatever they like later on.”
The' SPA put the new plan on exhi-
bition last September, at the same
time asking local groups to submit any
objections they had, and the newly
formed Save the Lane Cove Valley
Committee presented a petition bear-
ing 2541 signatures, together with a
document listing all their reasons for
protest. “The area is full of the most
wonderful birdlife,” Mrs. Swain says.
“But it’s not just the thought of the
destruction of flora and fauna. We’re
asking for the preservation of a river
valley a place only six miles from
the GPO where you can still see ducks
and herons nesting, and which is still
very beautiful, despite the development
that’s gone on around it.”
The committee also presented the
SPA with a series of questions, one of
which asked if the original route had
been rescinded. No, the SPA replied,
definitely not. In fact, the properties
along the West Lane Cove route had
been acquired. “Yet I remember read-
ing a Press statement last year saying
one of the reasons for changing the
route was the cost of acquiring the
land,” Mrs. Swain says. “There are
perhaps 140 houses affected in the old
plan. Dislodging 140 families would
certainly be unpleasant, but it is a
social cost concentrated on those
families, whereas the question of con-
servation is diffused throughout the
community.”
Mrs. Swain believes that “about a
dozen,” private properties are touched
by the new plan. “A good half of the
people who come along to our meet-
ings are concerned about the preser-
vation of the valley rather than pri-
vate property.”
Whatever the SPA’s real ambitions,,
at least it succeeds in fostering com-
munity spirit.

AUSTRALIA
Prime Minister Gorton helped a little in
advance by the make-up girl (picture left)
and his Press secretary, Mr. Tony Eggleton
(picture right), faces the cameras of the
ABC’s “Four Corners”
Twelve months to go full circle
PERHAPS THE CYNICS in Canberra
are turning out to be right after all.
They said all along that Mr. Gorton’s
much-publicised “strategic reassessment”
would be just a lot of hoo-ha and that
after a great amount of confusion and
thinking aloud in high places, Australia’s
foreign policy would come out much
the same as it was before.
From Mr. Gorton’s Press conference
last week it looked as if this were so.
Events seemed to have turned full
circle, with the Prime Minister moving
back to a sort of Harold Holt position
when he said that the Government had
now taken the major decisions on
defence policy as covered by the 80-
page reassessment compiled in the
Defence Department.
Earlier in the year, Mr. Gorton
didn’t look like this at all when he let
himself become known as an advocate
of “fortress Australia,” a catch-phrase
which Liberals had for years used to
denigrate the Labor Party and its neut-
ralist policies. Although he didn’t use
the phrase publicly, he was reported to
have used it privately at a dramatic
meeting of Government Members on
May 8, and he confirmed himself in the
public mind as a “fortress Australia”
man by a long series of remarks on
different public occasions and by his
failure to dissociate himself from the
idea.
One South-East Asian leader is said
to have wisecracked: “It isn’t who is
going to fill the vacuum left by the
British that we are really pondering.
It is who is going to fill the vacuum
left by Plarold Holt.” ' -
By Wednesday, December 4, the
Cabinet had had three days of meetings
on the strategic reassessment. At these
meetings Mi'. Gorton indicated a soften-
ing of his hostility to the continued
stationing of Australian forces in
Malaysia-Singapore beyond 1971. Elis
colleagues noticed that unanimity was
much closer than before, but they didn’t
see unanimity as so close that major
decisions had actually been made. On
the contrary, Mr. Gorton had repeated
the view he expressed in the censure
debate in Parliament that there were
too many imponderables facing Aus-
tralia for its policy to be specifically
declared.
However, Mr. Fairhall was able to
convince the Prime Minister that there
was now sufficient agreement for him
to give the Defence Department and
the Services the green light to prepare
a detailed submission on new equipment
which would be needed. It was agreed
that even if Australia was not going to
keep ground troops in Malaysia-
Singapore after 1971, the Army should
have the equipment and weaponry so
that they could be rapidly used for
operations in that region.
But the Prime Minister indicated to
his colleagues only that he would make
up his mind on the broader policy
issues of troop disposition after 1971
within the first three or four months
of 1969. Although he seemed closer to
their view that Australia should not pull
out with the British, the question to
Mr. Gorton’s Cabinet colleagues still
seemed unresolved,
At first no one was more astonished
than some of the Prime Minister’s own
Ministers when at his Press conference
last week he said that the post-1971
decisions had now been made: “The
basic decisions have been made.” Does
it just deal with military hardware, he
was asked. “No. It is our approach,” he
replied. Are the decisions as broad in
scope as the strategic reassessment?
“Yes, that is right,” he answered. The
decisions had crossed the whole range
°f the • strategic reassessment? The
Prime Minister again said yes.
This was at first taken to mean that
Australian troops would be kept in
Malaysia-Singapore after 1971. It was
only on the next day, when supplemen-
tary explanations were privately issued,
that it was learned that these statements
of Mr. Gorton’s did not mean that
there was yet a firm, decision on
whether or not to keep troops in Singa-
pore or Malaysia after 1971. All that
was meant was that it had been decided
that there would be some definite com-
mitment: but whether it is to be in the
form of troops already in the area or
troops stationed in Australia but ready
t 0 be deployed quickly to the area has
? et t 0 be decided.
Exactly what Mr. Gorton meant was
not publicly known until Saturday,
when, in a “Four Corners” interview, he
clarified the confusion: “We have told
them (the Services) the capabilities we


would like our forces to be able to
fulfil. They can then advise on the
composition of the forces to fulfil
those capabilities and the kind of arms
which would be provided and do their
planning in that way. That is one thing,
and the decisions needed to be taken
on that. That should be distinguished
from taking at this stage decisions not
as to composition of the forces but as
to disposition of the forces, not as to
capability of the forces but as to the
deployment of the forces at some time
in the future.”
At the Press conference Mr. Gorton
was definite in attacking the “fortress
Australia” thesis which for nearly a
year had been attributed to him. He
associated it instead with Dr. Jim
Cairns of the Labor Party. “For long
we have thought this was an utterly
ridiculous approach. You have, on the
one hand, everybody retiring this is
the concept of this phrase ‘fortress Aus-
tralia’ which is bandied about every-
one getting back inside Australia and
never getting out again. Just washing
their hands and just staying inside
Australia. That, in fact, was Cairns’
approach, if you remember. He drew a
line across tbe sea and said, ‘We stay
in Australia. We never get outside that.’
That proposition is put as black.
That is one proposition. The other
proposition is that you have all
your forces up forward and all doing
what is called ‘forward defence,’
but, in fact, we would prefer to
call it assistance to stability in the area
and assistance to the young countries
in the area, but still all up there. That
is white. And so you have got white
and you’ve got black. It is just silly to
say this is one alternative you take
that, or this is the other alternative
if you don’t take the first, you take the
second. You have all sorts of combina-
tions of greys in between. You have
black on the one side and white on the
other. One possibility is forces stationed
John Gorton thinks it over
abroad, with other forces ready and
mobile and able to back them up. Or
you have more forces stationed abroad
and possibly lesser mobile forces to
back them up. Or you engage in all
sorts of exercises. But the point is that
it is not just a choice between right,
here you are in ‘fortress Australia’—•
you never get out of it. You don’t
care what happens to any other country
in the region. You just sit there and
wait. Or we stick all our forces up in
Asia. It is not just that choice at all.
There are a whole lot of permutations
between them. But the idea seems to be
that if you don’t have forces stationed
up north, then you have got no interest
in them. You just wipe it off. You are
not just interested in military assistance
or anything of that kind. I am not
advocating that we should have forces
there. I am just trying to say, well,
what seems to have been in the public
mind is just not so.”
This still, leaves the Malaysian and
Singaporean Governments waiting to
know whether Australia is willing to
maintain a strong military presence on
the ground in the area beyond 1971.
But it might not be long now.

PRIORITY FOR 1969
SOME OBSERVERS in Canberra are
saying that 1969 might be the year of
the strategic reassessment of foreign
investment, now that defence has been
given the treatment. Mr. Gorton at his
Press conference last week agreed that
his 'various interventions late this year
represented a departure from previous
policy. Now a new policy might emerge
as the Government re-examines a broad
range of questions relating to foreign
investment and awaits submissions from
officials which will cover aspects of
policy not fully touched on by the
MLC intervention, the Gove arrange-
ment, and the discussions with Associ-
ated Stock Exchanges’ president
Mr. Looker.
By the hints to his thinking given at
the Press conference, Mr. Gorton is
not going to take a rigid line against
all foreign takeovers. He went out of
his way to say, for example, that it is
to the national advantage that
inefficient or conservative local firms
be bought out by foreigners and given
new management, capital, and know-
how.
So it seems unlikely there will be
any blanket regulations preventing
foreign takeovers. Mr. Gorton clearly
favors the establishment .of a National
Securities and Exchange Commission
along American lines, to take adminis-
tration of company law and stock-
exchange transactions out of the hands
of the States and vest it in the Federal
Government. He pointed out that the
Commonwealth doesn’t have the con-
stitutional power to establish such a
commission on its own, but he agreed
that with the co-operation of the
States it might be possible.
The approach to Mr. Looker was
made hurriedly, mainly on the basis
of requests from company manage-
ments in danger of being bought out.
Before his Press conference began, Mr.
Gorton took The Bulletin to task for
saying that the matter had not been
put to Cabinet. It had been, he said.
The only matter dealing with the Stock
Exchange not put to Cabinet was the
intervention on behalf of the MLC
company. The Bulletin understands,
however, that although the approach to
Mr. Looker was raised in Cabinet
there were no departmental papers pre-
pared on the subject and there was no
real discussion.
The Government is now at least pre-
paring a general reassessment of foreign
investment policy. Mr. Gorton clearly
does not approve of the old Liberal
policy of assuming that all foreign
investment is of benefit. He charac-
terised this old policy as “capital at
any price; just let it come in and forget
about it as long as you can get it.”
TARIFFS
GORTON-McEWEN SPLIT?
PRIME MINISTER John Gorton is
not going to give way to Deputy Prime
Minister John McEwen on tariff policy.
At his Press conference last week,
The Bulletin asked him to say where
he stood in relation to the claims by
Mr. McEwen that the Tariff Board
was going beyond its authority in
adopting its new procedures for tariff
inquiries. Asked whether the Govern-
ment believed the Tariff Board was
doing the right thing in deciding to
publish a classification of industries and
to announce that in general it would
recommend tariff protection for low-
cost, efficient industries, he replied:
“My recollection of Mr. McEwen’s
speech is that it contains the statement
that the Tariff Board is and must
remain an independent authority and
the Government would not wish to
interfere with it in the way in which
it did its work. That is my approach. If
they are independent, if they want to
adopt a particular approach, that is
their business . . .”
Asked again whether the Government
had any objection to what the Tariff
Board bas done in formulating a new
approach, he said: “The Tariff Board is
and must remain an independent
authority working along the lines it
thinks best in formulating its decisions,
its recommendations to the Govern-
ment. It is an independent authority
and one doesn’t interfere with it.”
This contrasted strongly with Mr.
McEwen’s heavy rubbishing of the
Board members and his claim that the
Board had broken new ground and was
departing from tradition contrary to the
Government’s wishes. Mr. McEwen’s
spokesman confirmed in a conversation
last week that his Minister believed the


Minister for Trade McEwen ...
rubbishing the Tariff Board
Board had exceeded its proper
authority, and that this was the Govern-
ment view.
But the Prime Minister is apparently
not going to be pushed by Mr. McEwen
and is sticking to his position as
enunciated in Parliament when tabling
the Tariff Board report: that anything
the Board does up until the time of
presenting its report to the Govern-
ment is its own business. Mr. McEwen,
with the Chamber of Manufactures on
his back, wants to circumscribe the
Board by keeping its inquiries focused
on the protective needs of individual
industries, with the Department of
Trade firmly controlling the flow of
references of inquiries to the Board.
But Tariff Board Chairman Alf Ratti-
gan has made it clear in a number of
addresses that he believes that the
old procedure of examining protective
needs, industry by industry, in isolation,
does not conform with either the Act
under which the Board is constituted
or the needs of Government economic
policy. So, like Mr. Gorton, he is not
going to be intimidated by Mr.
McEwen.
Mr. McEwen himself continues to
lose prestige through his discovery of
sinister plots and secret cells. The secret
cell in the Graziers’ Association which
he exposed to the Federal Council of the
Country Party at the weekend
is the latest. Their crime evidently
was to suggest that the interests of their
members might be better served by
supporting the Liberal Party rather
than the Country Party, something
most of them already do.
S.A. ELECTORAL REFORM
CONFUSING THE ISSUES
LAST WEEK’S episode in. the continu-
ing story of South Australian electoral
reform simply confused an already
intricately contrived plot. With Govern-
ment and Opposition having reached
broad agreement on the terms by which
Electoral Commissioners would under-
take the 47-seat redistribution of the
Lower House, the Bill setting up the
Commission went to the Government-
controlled but clearly not Government-
disciplined Legislative Council. The
Council extensively amended the Bill
by adding terms for its own redistribu-
tion which would give it four six-
member seats (two in the city and two
in the country) as against its present
five four-member seats (two in the city
and three in the country).
It is just such an amendment that
the Labor Opposition will not accept,
and when the Bill arrived back in the
Lower House the Premier’s announce-
ment of Government support for the
amendments was greeted by uproar.
“This would be one of the most dis-
graceful examples of political trickery
the State has seen,” said Opposition
Leader Don Dunstan, holding that the
Government had given undertakings not
to include Council redistribution in
the Bill. “This measure would gerry-
mander the electorate for the Legisla-
tive Council to the extent that if the
ALP, after a redivision of this kind,
gained better than 60 percent of the
vote, it would not get more than six
seats out of the 24 members,” he said,
claiming further that if the Commis-
sioners divided in the way the Council
proposes, the 12 country Members
would represent only 182,000 electors to
the 12 city Members 428,000 electors.
It is possible that Premier Steele Hall
was himself surprised and even embar-
rassed by the Council’s stand, which he
defended uneasily, agreeing at a Press
conference that Mr. Dunstan’s “figures
would be substantially right though I
haven’t checked them.” He pointed out
that the proposed distribution would
at least give four new Members to the
city so that “you will find that there is
some improvement as far as the city
is concerned.”
But the Opposition was not prepared
to let the matter rest. Mr. Dunstan
described the Government’s support of
the amendments as “political perfidy”
and claimed that the move was designed
to “make the Government appear to
be seeking electoral reform while care-
fully providing conditions to ensure
that electoral reform does not take
place.” Mr. Hall retorted, “This is of
course rubbish. It would be foolish to
throw away the very major progress we
have made in Assembly redistribution
for the sake of this particular issue.”
Yet the fact is that this particular
issue is also closely tied to the Opposi-
tion Bill presently before the Council
for a universal Council franchise. This
Bill, to the surprise and dismay of many
LCL Council Members, was supported
by the Premier, the Attorney-General,
and other Ministers in the Lower House
following their insertion of clauses pro-
viding for a referendum prior to any
move to abolish the Council, and a non-
compulsory enrolment and vote. It is
widely known that some MLCs are
very unhappy with the stand Mr. Hall
took on the franchise issue. On the
adjournment last week for the
Christmas recess, the Bill and amend-
ments were left to hang fire until
February with Mr. Hall leaving the
door still ajar. “It is still possible for
the Assembly redistribution to be con-
sidered in isolation,” he said, placat-
ingly and perhaps hopefully.
DUNTROON
FUTURE INDEFINITE
DISSATISFACTION about the Gov-
ernment’s indecision on the future of
the Royal Military College at Duntroon
in Canbera welled up last week—on the
College’s big day when 80 officers
graduated amid the annually displayed
ceremonial of the graduation parade.
There was particular irritation at
the fact that for the first time in the
memory of the College staff, the
Government was unrepresented. It had
been customary for either the Minister
for Defence or one of the Service Mini-
sters to be there, or else a Minister
closely associated with the Services. But
this time there was no one, although
Mr. Whitlam was there representing the
Opposition.
The Commandant of the College,
Major-General Fraser, had some sharp
words to say in his speech about the
difficulties the College was going
through. Officers and staff present won-
dered if no one from the Government
had turned up because the Government
feels guilty about the way the College
is being treated.
The extreme difficulty under which
Duntroon is operating was highlighted
in the College’s annual report, when
it referred to severe deficiencies in
accommodation and equipment. The
Commandant, in his graduation
address, referred to the difficulties of
Last week’s graduation at Duntroon ...
a shortage of officers
the staff of the College in transferring
to University of N.S.W. status. Staff
morale is rapidly declining as the Col-
lege’s building program remains frozen
and its future continues to be
unresolved.
The Government is working on a
scheme to coalesce officer training for
the three Services into the one tri-
Service institution, and it is known that
Duntroon has been recommended as
the nucjeus of this. But the work is
proceeding very slowly. Meanwhile,
teaching at Duntroon suffers and noth-
ing can be done to overcome the acute
shortage of Army officers.


CONSUMERS
CLIPPING THE CON MEN
AS PARLIAMENT rose in New South
Wales last week it seemed less like
Breaking Up Week than Con Man’s
Disaster Week with proposal following
proposal for further consumer protec-
tion legislation when Parliament resumes
in February.
Premier Askin announced three of
the proposals. (1) A Bill is being
prepared to supplement the Federal
inter-State restrictive practices legisla-
tion and prohibit collusive bidding and
tendering within N.S.W. (2) Following
complaints from magistrates that they
are only able to impose minor penalties
on persons who run filthy shops, legis-
lation is being prepared to allow the
shutting down of shops which offend
the health laws. (3) A Bill will be
introduced early next year to set up
a Government Consumers’ Affairs
Bureau under a Commissioner of Con-
sumers’ Affairs, and a citizens advisory
Consumers’ Affairs Council under a
public service chairman.
This third proposal follows months of
agitation and a report on foreign
developments in consumer protection
by Mr. Newbigging, the N.S.W. Prices
Commissioner. The Citizens’ Council
will have at least four consumers and
four trade representatives on it. It will
meet part time and in private, receive
public complaints, and advise Labor and
Industry Minister Willis on legislation
or administration. The teeth of the pro-
posed Bill will he in the Bureau. As
well as receiving complaints on false
advertising, dangerous goods (flammable
clothes, unsafe toys, or lawnmowers for
example), • dishonest trading and
collusive bidding or tendering, it will
inidate exposures and prosecutions. It
will also undertake research.
The Government has rejected price
control as a solution (only petrol and
bread prices are controlled) and Mr.
Willis has emphasised that the Bill will
be experimental. The idea is to add to it
from time to time. “Don’t expect
Utopia,” he said last week. “There will
always be con men and gullible cus-
tomers.” But if he needs further
guidance he could refer to the annual
report of the Victorian Consumers’
Protection Council tabled last week in
Melbourne. The Victorian Council
examined over 2000 complaints in the
year and exposed dishonest door-to-door
salesmen, food freezer salesmen, electri-
cal and car repairers and household
improvers. Since it is unlikely that
N.S.W. con men are less enterprising
than Victoria’s, the new Bureau and
Council should be busy from the start.
The final proposal of the week came
from the Building Industry Conference
in Sydney calling for protection for
home buyers by the compulsory registra-
tion of builders and consequent pro-
tection of unscrupulous shoddy build-
ings. At the moment plumbers and
electricians are licensed, but not
builders. Municipal Council Inspectors
have wide powers over builders, but
they may only be used if the purchaser
N.S.W. Premier Askin and Chief Secre-
tary Willis .. . “Don’t expect Utopia”
applies to the Council before construc-
tion starts. Few do.
A few more weeks like this and the
afternoon newspapers will start to object
that the Government is undermining
their hot lines and action lines. They
can always complain to the Consumers’
Affairs Council.
WELFARE
WAR ON CHILDREN
ALTHOUGH HOSPITALS have for a
number of years been aware of the
“battered child syndrome” and of the
wider and more subtle problems of
child neglect and deprivation as specific
social maladies, public debate on the
maltreatment of children has been
sporadic and in the past two years
mainly concentrated in Victoria.
The matter began to take public
form in 1966 when Melbourne physician
Dr. Dora Bialestock wrote in the “Aus-
tralian Medical Journal” that a con-
trolled study of nearly 300 neglected
children had convinced her that this
social distemper amounted to a “situa-
tion of national emergency as lethal to
the lives of potential young Australians
as is a war.” In the same issue two
other Melbourne physicians, Dr. John
and Dr. Robert Birrell, wrote that cases
of battered children occurred “with
alarming frequency” and that the
“syndrome is widespread.”
As a direct result of these claims, the
Victorian Government set up a senior
interdepartmental committee to investi-
gate the allegations. It reported that
on the evidence presented it could not
agree with either statement. The com-
mittee made a report late in 1967 which
made a number of recommendations for
securing better treatment and care of
neglected children including the estab-
lishment of a scheme which would
enable doctors voluntarily to report
cases of serious beatings. The report
also recommended the enactment of a
provision for fining parents who left
their children unattended for an
“unreasonable time.”
The report was criticised by social
workers and a number of doctors for
failing to deal with the root of the
problem: the prevention, of neglect and
mistreatment by adequate contact with
problem families by locally based wel-
fare workers. The voluntary scheme
was criticised because it was felt that
doctors would be very reluctant to file
reports on their patients; after a year
the 30 cases so far reported are
regarded by some as obviously not rep-
resenting the true picture. Criticism of
the legislative provision raised wider
issues. It has been argued that punitive
action is entirely unreal: deserted wives
or widows may have no other choice
but to leave their children while they
work an.d to punish the psychotic
parents of battered children would
achieve nothing except intensifying
family hostility.
Since cases of neglect and cruelty are
almost entirely predictable, social
workers almost unanimously want to
see much more intensive care and con-
tinuous contact with women once they
leave the maternity hospital. Dr.
Bialestock believes strongly that bad
nourishment in the first two years is
directly related to later mental inade-
quacy and she argues that if only to
prevent people becoming a costly
burden to the State later, they should
be cared for in these highly crucial
early years.
Fresh life was injected into the debate
by the recent publication of a further
article by the Birrells. The committee
was reconvened but the Minister
thought the Birrells’ survey of 42 cases
treated at the Royal Children’s Hospi-
tal would not present anything new.
While that may also be the com-
mittee’s view, the article did stir the
muddy pool again. The Birrells con-
sidered it vital that teams of doctors
and social workers should have the
power to remove children from their
home if they were convinced that the
child was in danger.
Last week the South Australian
Social Welfare Advisory Council
released its report on cruelty to child-
ren; as a result the South Australian
Government early next year will amend
the Act to spell out what makes a
guardian unfit to care for a child.
The council, in its report, says that
it does not think it necessary to intro-
duce legislation to make the reporting
of cruelty to children mandatory. It
recommends that a voluntary system
of reporting be introduced for a trial
period of two years.
Resolution of these difficult questions
is made no easier by the recollection of
the question asked by Dostoevsky’s
character Ivan Karamazov: he asked
whether a man faced with the inescap-
able choice of torturing “just one tiny
baby” so that he could build an edifice
of human destiny to bring happiness to
all would be able to construct his vision
on the child’s unrequited tears. “Tell
me,” he said, “and do not lie.”


INTERNATIONAL
Nixon’s team: looking after number one
By ANTHONY HOWARD
in Washington
WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT of
his Cabinet appointments Mr. Richard
Nixon has confirmed what most people
had suspected all along: America is now
about to enter a new and much more
cautious phase in its political life. The
men who will move into the executive
suites in the various Government build-
ings on January 20 could hardly be
more different from the adventurous,
confident, innovative figures who
arrived here with John F. Kennedy just
eight years ago. The nation has been
served clear notice that the messianic
liberal spirit which dominated eight
years of Democratic rule has now run
its course. The new men are not vision-
aries, for the most part they are not
even reformers. They are competent
technicians and operatives who are
likely to see their supreme task as being
to ensure and guarantee the politics of
stability.
The temptation, of course, is to mourn
the passing of an era in which self-
confident leaders with lofty ideals tried
to remake the nation and the world
in their own liberal image. But as
the curtain comes down on eight years
of not so much orthodox democratic
administration as doctrinaire, progres-
sive running of America’s affairs, it is
by no means obvious that the justifica-
tion is there for doing so.
John Kennedy did not, after all,
involve America in Vietnam on con-
servative grounds. He and Lyndon
Johnson over the unheeded warnings
of such “reactionaries” as Senator
Richard Russell of Georgia—threw the
whole weight of American power into
that particular cockpit because the issue
to liberal idealists and radical reformers
seemed to be clear-cut. Here, it
appeared to those, manning Kennedy’s
new frontier, was a splendid chance
for “nation-building,” an opportunity
to demonstrate that a democracy
American style (with a little help from
those Queen Scouts of the early 19605,
the JFK proteges with their green
berets in the Special Forces) could,
after all, be successfully exported even
to a backward country in South-East
Asia.
It would be a rash man who would
predict that the new figures now com-
ing to Washington in their grey flannel
suits and button-down collars will avoid
any such future involvement. But at
least the motive force behind such well-
intentioned adventures looks as if it
will be a great deal less powerful in the
years immediately ahead. For while the
McNamaras, the McGeorge Bundys,
and even the Walt Rostows wanted to
save the world, the men whom Mr.
Nixon took on their first visit to the
White House last week believe first of
all in looking after number one
The President-elect feels the chill winds
of New York’s winter
which in their case means safeguarding
American prosperity.
The prospects look much the same
on the domestic front. The central
article of Government faith over the
past eight years has been, a, belief in
the efficacy of central government pro-
grams—a belief never more nakedly
revealed than in a comment made last
week by President Johnson’s chief
White House assistant, Mr. Joseph
Califano.
He was not, Mr. Califano told a
newspaper interviewer, worried about
the future of LBJ’s “great society.”
This was because when Mr. Nixon
left office in 1961 there were only
some 45 domestic social' programs, but
the new President would find when he
took possession of the White House on
January 20 that there were no fewer
than 435. The pattern, of Federal inter-
vention was now, Mr. Califano seemed
to be complacently assuming, irrevers-
ible, without for a moment pausing to
question whether it had, in fact, proved
to be the most effective instrument
available for the purpose of combating
poverty.
There seems little doubt that one of
the first priorities of the new Republi-
can administration will be to examine
with a careful accountant’s eye the
whole field of central government wel-
fare spending. For the deprived and
underprivileged of the nation the
result of the process is only too likely
to be painful.
Over the past two years, however, it
has not just been reactionaries who have
•expressed doubts about the notion that
the poor can be saved by Government
experts operating out of the capital
city of Washington. It was the liberal
commentator Richard Rovere who a
year or. so ago wrote that “almost
everyone feels that there is no greater
hindrance to the war on poverty and
no greater force for the perpetuation of
slums than the public welfare system
administered by, and providing a iaison
d’etre for, a huge, entrenched, and com-
placent sub-bureaucracy with Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare.” If the Negro urban poor, in the
damning words of Mr. Nixon’s new
colorful urban affairs adviser, Dr.
Daniel Moynihan, are today “further
away from the goal of fulfilment than
they were eight years ago” it is at least
partly because of the traditional New
Deal liberal reliance on a policy of
central government intervention.
Yet to say all that is by no means,
of course, to demonstrate that Mr.
Nixon’s new men will necessarily turn
out to have the remedy for solving the
nation’s ills both at home and abroad.
In their very anonymity they do, how-
ever, perhaps start out with one solid
advantage.
Even the normally sensible editorial
page of the “New York Times” could
not resist greeting the news of the new
President’s main appointments with the
predictable lament: “At a time when the
country is looking for inspiration the
Nixon Cabinet is certainly unexciting.”
In that comment there lies perhaps the
true evidence of the really dangerous
legacy that eight years of Democrat
rule have left in America.
John, Kennedy practised the politics
of exhilaration, Lyndon Johnson (at
least until his last sad days) the poli-
tics of exuberance: a plausible case can
be made that between them they
succeeded in bewildering this nation into
believing that inspiration is a substitute
for action., excitement for execution.
Ironically, one of the best epitaphs on


the Democratic record- comes from the
man who would if the Party had
succeeded in retaining power in all
probability today be the incoming
Secretary of State. “Our problems,”
Mr. George Ball once observed, “have
very largely stemmed from a lack of
consistency between a perception of the
limits of power that has determined
our action and a sonorous universalist
dogma that has infected our elocution.”
Whatever else they may prove to be
weak in, the men who make up Mr.
Nixon’s new Cabinet are unlikely to
display that particular fault. They are
—the fact has to be faced as un-
exciting a collection of individuals (the
four old personal friends, the three
dingily distinguished Republican, Gov-
ernors, the trio of middle western
academics, the pillar of the national
chamber of commerce, the one solitary
representative from Capitol Hill) as
any President has ever summoned to
assist him in the task of running the
nation’s government.
But, precisely because they scarcely
suggest men who are in the habit of
seeing visions or dreaming dreams, they
start at least with an even chance of
applying the necessary corrective after
a period of liberal rule in which the
aspirations of two successive adminis-
trations were never in, any doubt though
the nature of their actual achievements
has come more and more into question.
MALAYSIA
A NEW "PEOPLE'S WAR"
By DENNIS BLOODWORTH
ANOTHER “Malayan emergency” is
now threatened here. From 1948 to
1960, Anglo-Malayan security forces
patiently chopped up the guerilla army
of the Malayan Communist Party until
the remnants of its last three “regi-
ments” withdrew across the frontier
into Thailand.
But today, as British forces begin to
thin out ready for final evacuation, the
Communist call for armed revolution
throughout Malaysia looks as if it is
being heard. The new danger lies in
the potential of the Communist leaders
for inciting racial violence.
The past month has seen a new wave
of 146 arrests, a stringent Customs
check for Maoist propaganda, and a
running fight with the biggest gang
of armed terrorists yet encountered on
the northern border with Thailand.
In June the heavily penetrated
Labor Party of Malaya issued a policy
directive signalling that the time had
arrived once more for “taking up the
gun and carrying out the people’s war”
and announced “the outbreak of a new
revolutionary storm is inevitable.”
I he main theme of a great clutter of
captured Communist paraphernalia
shown to me this week at Kuala
Lumpur’s Central Police Headquarters
was Mao Tse Tung and his famous
dictum “Rebellion is justified.”
A huge red-and-gold banner in praise
of Chairman Mao had been found at
the site of the first Malayan “com-
mune” organised by local Communists
in emulation of those formed in China
ten years ago, when Mao tried to
brigade the peasantry into disciplined
and self-sufficient collectives in which
all property was pooled. In North
Sumatra 10,000 Chinese herded into a
transhipment area to await collection
by boat from China have been organ-
ised by activists among them into a
tight-run commune which sells produce
ranging from bean curds to brooms
in nearby Medan and buys immunity
from hostile Indonesian authorities out
of its profits.
In the Malayan peninsula, where
other communes have already been
unearthed in at least two States, the
Communists are out to develop a rash
of these small Red enclaves across the
countryside until the time arrives for
“using the villages to besiege the
towns.” As in China, students have also
been sent down to these “farms” to be
Chin Peng ... another “emergence”
taught the mechanics of the commune
system and Maoist theory. In their
drive for a united front, the Com-
munists have deeply penetrated Chinese
schools, at least four big trade unions,
and two Left-wing opposition parties,
which now threaten to boycott elections
next year.
Although the Communists depend
principally on frustrated Chinese proud
of Mao’s achievements and edgy about
the future of their language and cul-
tural heritage in a mainly Malay world,
they have also been, trying to build
up Malay support by depicting Maoism
and Islam as fellow sufferers with the
same ideals, persecuted by the imperial-
ists and their puppets in Kuala Lumpur
and Singapore. “Converted” Chinese
Communist cadres have infiltrated the
movement among young Muslims in
the four predominantly Malay provinces
of South Thailand who are disenchanted
with Buddhist rule- from Bangkok.
In special schools Party cadres are
taught how to win Muslims over, and
the “Central Department of Malay
Work of the MCP has been trying to
■ recruit Malays through the Right-wing
Muslim ‘Pan-Malayan Islamic Party in
Malaysia.’ It was disclosed here yester-
day that youngsters had until recently
been riding across the border openly on
scooters to be brainwashed and then
pushed back into Malaysia for political
action in their home States.”
Earlier this week combined Thai and
Malaysian security forces captured a
jungle camp capable of taking 200
trainees in terrorism and they are pur-
suing a 150-strong guerilla group that
has winged nine police so far in three
separate clashes with patrols. It is
estimated there are nearly 1000 hard-
core armed terrorists of the Malayan
National Liberation Army in the jungle
on the Thai side of the frontier. They
are given close support by about 2000
militants drawn from the younger
generation, of local Chinese, who in turn
collect dues, food, and information for
the guerillas from twice that number
of active sympathisers.
Four companies of the workmanlike
Malaysian police field force operate in
conjunction with the Thais against the
Communists on the other side. Nearly
200 subversives have been picked up
in the region, but security pressure in
the villages only tends to flush mili-
tants into the jungle instead of out of
it. So far police patrols have discovered
91 secret terrorist camps, and it is
believed that Chin Peng, the veteran
MCP leader who fought the British for
12 years, is still personally directing his
guerillas on the Thai side of the
border.
This week 1 the Malaysian Minister
described the Communist build-up
across the frontier as a “festering sore
which, if not checked, may be impos-
sible to cure.” However, the Buddhist
Thais, suspicious of Malay irredentism,
are cautious about allowing Malaysian
forces free rein. Malaysian troops and
armored vehicles are forbidden to cross
into Thailand, and no Thai troops are
engaged. Malaysian helicopters must get
Thai clearance before supplying field
force patrols. In joint operations
Malaysian police must not outnumber
the Thais.
For the Thais this is a sideshow. But
for the Malaysians the new “armed
struggle” of the MCP is like the
familiar opening to a recurring night-
mare. Some critics accuse the Govern-
ment of exaggerating the threat to
justify the suppression of legitimate
opponents. Others argue that Mao's
theories on peasant-revolution cannot
apply in the game - and - rubber
geography of Malaysia’s jungles and
industrial plantations. But most agree
that it is time to wake up.
JORDAN
A NEW PALESTINE?
By GAVIN YOUNG
AN IMPORTANT new avenue to an
Israel-Arab peace has been opened up
bv the statement of King Hussein of
Jordan in an exclusive interview with
me last week that he is willing to


renounce sovereignty over the west bank
of Jordan if this would help a settle-
ment.
During the interview in his palace, I
asked the King if this meant that the
west bank inhabited by Palestinian
Arabs and occupied since June last year
by Israeli forces would then become
a new state called “Palestine.” He
replied quietly: “Yes, if that is what
the people want.”
The significance of this statement has
to be seen in the context of various
King Hussein . .. what the people want
tentative peace proposals that have been
circulating during recent weeks. The
essence of these proposals, which have
come to King Hussein from the Ameri-
cans and from the Israelis, who have
used such couriers as the Mayor of
Nablus, seems to be as follows:
1. The west bank would be evacu-
ated by the Israelis. 2. East Jerusalem
would be the headquarters of an
autonomous Palestinian State in a
special relationship with Jordan. 3. This
State could have access to the Mediter-
ranean at Haifa and Gaza. 4. The whole
area would be demilitarised.
Up to now, there have been two
principal snags—among many—to such
a plan. One was the assumption that
King Hussein would refuse to give up
sovereignty of the west bank now
proved wrong by his remarks to me this
week. The second obstacle was the
firmly reiterated Israeli intention to
hang on to Jerusalem. The Arabs will
accept nothing that does not restore
Jerusalem to them. Yet a hopeful sign
was the statement made this week by
a senior official of the Israeli Foreign
Office that the status of Jerusalem was
still negotiable.
King Hussein told me that even
before the June war he had been ex-
ploring ways of granting more self-
government for the west-bankers. The
King stressed that he believed that if
there was an honorable alternative to
endless fighting, the young Jordanians,
whether from the east or west bank,
would take it.
If it came to the pinch, King Hussein
told me, he would be content to remain
ruler of the east bank of Jordan —the
equivalent of what, under his grand-
father King Abdullah, was called
Transjordan—“if the people here want
that.”
He said that there might be other
solutions to the present position. But
the point he was trying to make was
that he was prepared to go that far,
to diminish his kingdom, if the require-
ments of peace in the area dictated it.
What is noteworthy in the King’s
position, apart from the personal sacri-
fice it could involve, is that it would
throw a great challenge to the Pales-
tinian militants. In a settlement which
demilitarised a separate west bank, they
would be faced with the choice of
making something of their new fiefdom
in peace or of continuing their resist-
ance from their own ground.
This is only one of the appalling
difficulties which still hedge the path
of peace. Will, for example, the Pales-
tinians be able to go back, and if so
how many? There are estimated to be
2,500,000 Palestinian Arabs, and 700,000
are on the west bank now.
Are the Israelis really willing to
withdraw from the west bank? Since the
June war, Arabs point out grimly, there
has not been the smallest token with-
drawal from any Arab territory. Above
all, and of supreme importance, even if
numerous west-bankers accept such a
settlement, will the Palestinian com-
mando organisations do so, too?
Again, the theory behind the argu-
ments of those Arab leaders who are
pursuing a settlement is that the basic
question of Palestine and Israel will
be solved in the long term by a gradual
welding of Arab and Israel populations,
economies, and societies on, say,
Lebanese lines. This is far too subtle
and undramatic for the majority of
Arab militants. It presupposes a confi-
dence in Israeli promises and motives
that simply does not exist today.
The two signs of flexibility this week
from King Hussein and the Israeli
official have only fractionally light-
ened the burden of despair about a
peace settlement that weighs increas-
ingly on Arabs of all classes, on neutral
diplomats here, and on King Hussein
himself.
BRITAIN
STERLING'S SLOW CURE
MR. REGINALD MAUDLING,
Britain’s Conservative shadow Chancel-
lor of the Exchequer, spoke last week of
the “dangers of totally new dimensions”
which face Britain as a result of the
“persistent weakness” of the pound
abroad and the “gathering flight” from
money at home. What is the evidence
for his fears? Is Britain’s economy in
such a bad state that it justifies the
doubts widely expressed last week about
the stability of her political and social
order?
Economic recovery in Britain since
devaluation is proving depressingly
slow, and the exaggerated expectations
with which politicians of both parties
misled the country about economic
growth is leading to an understandable
reaction from the voters.
At the same time the manifest weak-
ness of the international currency
system and the risk that there could
be another world monetary crisis at any
time is putting a severe strain on sterl-
ing, which is still in the middle of a
long convalescence.
The very satisfactory November
trade figures, with a £l7 million visible
deficit after seasonable adjustment,
provided further confirmation that the
trade balance was improving slowly but
steadily before the imposition of the
special deposits scheme for imports,
which is likely to slow down imports
substantially over the coming months.
If the December trade figures are in
line with recent trends and Britain con-
tinues to earn a surplus on her invisible
trade at the rate of over £lOO million
a quarter, it is likely that the fourth
quarter’s balance of payments will turn
out with only a modest current deficit.
In the third quarter the seasonally
adjusted current balance is now put
Maudling . .. are there such dangers?
at a deficit of £BO million. Of this,
£35 million is explained by payments
for American military aircraft which
are more or less offset by an American
loan for their purchase. So it is reason-
able to put the “genuine” current
deficit in the third quarter at £45 mil-
lion. The subsequent improving trend
in the visible trade balance suggests
that the deficit for the fourth quarter,
calculated in the same way, could be
very small. Moreover, the continued
favorable trend of exports and the
likelihood of restraint on imports


through the imports deposit scheme sug-
gest there will be a swing into current
account surplus in the early months of
1969.
A mere surplus on current account is
nothing like enough when Britain has
finance debt repayments and the normal
outflow of long-term capital. But it
will mark the point where she is no
longer running down her net overseas
wealth.
What of Mr. Maudling’s reference to
“the dangers of totally new dimen-
sions” namely, the “gathering flight
from money at home”? It is extremely
difficult to get hard evidence about
what is happening, but the indications
are that while there is a flight into real
values the threat to economic stability
is much less than it may appear.
One essential distinction to draw is
that between a flight out of money and
assets (such as gilt-edged securities and
national savings certificates) in.to other
assets such as equities, unit trusts, and
antiques, and a flight out of saving into
current consumption. The former, in
which people decide to hold more of
their wealth in assets with a built-in
edge around inflation, has no seriously
harmful effect on the economy as a
whole. The big danger in a flight from
money values into real values arises
when it leads people to reduce the total
amount of their savings rather than
switch from one form of saving to
another. If they reduce the total amount
of saving and consume more, there is
additional inflationary pressure.
Casual observation suggests that some
people in Britain are consuming more
and saving less because they expect
inflation to continue. But there is
remarkably little statistical evidence to
indicate that this kind of switch is at
all important. The national institute’s
estimates of the ratio of savings to con-
sumers’ disposable income suggest a
fall from about 7.75 percent in 1967 to
about 7.2 percent in the first three-
quarters of 1968. This is hardly a
dramatic shift, and factors other than
inflationary expectation have almost
certainly contributed to it.
At the same time there is a press-
ing need for more consumer savings to
help finance British investment for
future growth. The case still remains
for tax concessions designed to increase
voluntary saving.
THE GREEK JUNTA
EUROPE ON TRIAL?
THE “Greek Torture Case,” which
opened dramatically before the Euro-
pean Human Rights Commission in
Strasbourg last month, enters its second
act this week with a further three-day
hearing. The Commission’s proceed-
ings are strictly confidential, but enough
has leaked out about the first hearing
to show that the case against the Greek
ruling junta, accused of torturing
prisoners, is already formidable. If the
next session proves as damaging To the
Greek Pre-
mier Papa-
dopoulos,
centre front,
and junta
members
Pattakos
(left) and
Makarezos
junta, the temptation for the Greek
official representatives to walk out of
the hearings will be very strong. Yet
the Commission can continue to take
evidence in the absence of one of the
parties.
In the New Year the Commission is
due to go to Greece. Reports suggest
that there it will be confronted with an
array of “volunteered” statements by
ex-prisoners, saying that neither they
nor anyone they know has been mal-
treated. The Cofrimission may, however,
send for other witnesses who may tell
a different tale. The Commission is
unlikely to hand down its verdict for
several months, and the report will be
secret. But already there is speculation
as to whether the Commission and the
new European idea it represents will
stand up to a possible clash between
justice and truth and political ex-
pediency. Under the Commission’s pro-
cedure, if the parties in dispute are
unable to find an “amicable settle-
ment” on the basis of the secret report,
the next step must be decided by the
Ministers of the Council of Europe.
If the report finds against the Greek
Government, the Ministers may find
themselves in the midst of a political
crisis. While some may want some kind
of sanctions against Greece, others
will be concerned with the strategic
importance of Greece in NATO rather
than with humanitarian considerations
—especially with the increased Russian
presence in the Mediterranean. But
the Scandinavians, who joined with the
Dutch in referring the complaint
against Greece to the Commission in
1967, are evidently intent on maintain-
ing the integrity of the Commission,
which was created as an embodiment
and protector of European democratic
ideals. They may be supported by other
small West European countries.
In Strasbourg, the Scandinavians and
their witnesses, many leading Greek
exiles, were staying down at the Grand
Hotel. The Greek Government team
were a mile away at the Maison Rouge.
But they were not quite separate, for
Andreas Papandreou, an exile leader,
with his retinue, had also booked in at
the Maison Rouge. But within a few
hours of a chance meeting, a message
written on lavatory paper and pushed
under a door had resulted in the
defection of the two witnesses, Meletis
and Marketakis, brought to Stras-
bourg by the Greek Government to
testify in its favor.
So scanty were early Greek Govern-
ment security arrangements that Meletis
simply walked down the stairs and
off down the street carrying his suit-
case. Marketakis came with a rush,
an hour or so later, and tumbled
through the door and up to the desk
of the Grand Hotel.
The Scandinavians also spoke to the
girl, Zaira Peta, who later disappeared,
oddly, in midweek. Greek security
men went everywhere with her, and
hotel sources told how she had been
in tears. The Greeks have promised to
bring her back this week. So many
mysteries surround her that it is hard
to foresee what may happen when—if
—she reappears.
But when Marketakis, the Cretan
defector, returned to his hotel for his
luggage, he was confronted by the
political head of the delegation and
was told that what he had done his
family would pay for. A later official
statement, however, said that the family
would be placed under secure Greek
Governmental protection. And the
current junta version of the reason for
Zaira Peta’s disappearance is that there
was no time for her to testify. But it
was immediately after the Scandi-
navians had asked for her to be brought
to the Commission that she suddenly
vanished.
According to sources within the Com-
mission, Marketakis’ entry and appear-
ance made an impact on the judges.
One elderly judge was reduced to tears
by his demeanor when taking the oath.
And what can a Commission whose
powers are basically those of per-
suasion feel when such a man thanks
them for “being so kind to me. But
please, honored sirs, will ■ you protect
my family?”
By midweek the Greek Ambassador
to the Council of Europe, Mr. Vitsaxis,
emerged from the building in tears.
“Twenty years a diplomat—l never
thought I’d ever have to do anything
like this for my country.”

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
PSYCHO-DENTISTS
MANY DENTISTS are turning to
Freud to find out what ails their
patients. Dr. Martin Protell, a leading
U.S. Professor of Dentistry, said: “We
know that extreme tension influences
periodontal disease,” including bleeding
gums and infection of bones beneath
gum tissue.
Freudian psychology is involved, Dr.
Protell pointed out, because the mouth
is “directly or symbolically related to
all the so-called human passions, and
acts as a personality set of the indi-
vidual, often functioning as a reflector
or mirror of the emotions.”
Dr. Protell’s observations resulted
from ten years of clinical dental work
on psychiatric patients in a New York
mental hospital. Fifty percent of the
male and more than 50 percent of the
female patients with periodontal disease
had psychologically disturbed person-
ality profiles. People in urban areas
suffered more periodontal disease than
those in rural areas, because of the
greater tensions and anxieties of city
life. Students cramming for exams and
men in the lower ranks of the Armed
Forces suffered frequently from trench
mouth (Vincent’s disease), resulting
from acute anxiety. Other physical
manifestations of pent-up emotions
were canker sores and broxism—uncon-
scious gnashing of teeth both awake and
asleep.
Dr. Protell said dentists of the future
must learn to treat the “whole patient”
rather than act as mere “plumbers of
teeth,” and many dental schools were
already offering courses in psychology.
BIRCH-POWER GROWS
IN CELEBRATION of its tenth anni-
versary, the ultra Right-wing John
Birch Society met this week and vowed
to “expose and rout the Communist
conspiracy” threatening the U.S. in its
next decade.
The secret society, formed by Robert
Welch, a Massachusetts candy manu-
facturer, to eliminate “the cancerous
disease of collectivism” from the body
politic, today numbers between 60,000
and 100,000 members in about 4000
chapters throughout the country. It
receives about $5 million annually in
dues, contributions, and receipts from
its various publications, using these
funds to provide speakers for groups
and TV appearances through its
American Opinion Speakers’ Bureau
and to publish books, pamphlets, and
similar propaganda material. In addi-
tion, the Society recruits thousands of
non-members in front groups such
as the Truth About Civil Turmoil
(TACT) and To Restore American
Independence Now (TRAIN).
Liberal groups fear that the Birch
Society already possesses power far
beyond that indicated by its numerical
strength and that it has the ability to
exploit controversial political issues.
Although Welch denies that the Society
is a political body, he admits that 80
percent of its members “not only voted
but worked for” the election of Gov-
ernor George Wallace, the segrega-
tionist third-party candidate, in the
recent Presidential election.
Wesley McCune, director of the
Reagan ... Birch unrepudiated
liberal-oriented Group Research, Incor-
porated, of Washington, warned last
week that the Birchites “were growing
in one direction for sure, and that’s in
sophistication, public relations, political
knowledgeability, and political man-
oeuvres. Their leaders are not kooks
and nuts. They are respectable. When
you have a Governor Ronald Reagan or
a George Wallace, big national figures,
who refuse to repudiate the Birch
Society, they’ve got some influence
somewhere.”
The Birch Society has organised 52
TACT committees in the Chicago area
alone. Welch boasted that these com-
mittees “certainly strengthened the
hands of Mayor Daley and the Chicago
police in keeping the revolutionary
activities planned by the Communists
for the period of the Democratic con-,
vention from getting entirely out of
hand.”
During its next decade, Welch pre-
dicted, the Birch Society would expand
activities overseas, starting soon in
Canada and going on to Australia,
Britain, and elsewhere.
PILL OR IUD?
THE AMERICAN Planned Parenthood
Federation estimated last week that 18
million women throughout the world
half of them in the U.S. were
using the Pill. About 6,500,000 women
including 1,500,000 Americans
were using intra-uterine devices
(lUD).
The use of the Pill was increasing
throughout the world at a faster rate
than the use of lUD, the Federation
added.
However, about one-third of Ameri-
can women who start taking the Pill
cease within two years because of
undesirable side effects, including
increased weight and mental depression.
The Pill has also been linked to blood-
clotting disorders and even cancer of
the cervix. American authorities now
recommend that women using the Pill
take the precaution of having a smear
test annually to check for early cervical
cancer.
The lUD also entails problems.
About a quarter of all women fitted
with the device either expel it involun-
tarily or must have it removed for
medical reasons within two years. The
Federation said the Pill was the more
effective contraceptive. If taken as
directed, the Pill was virtually 100 per-
cent effective, whereas the lUD was
associated with about four pregnancies
per 100 women even when it remained
in place.
NEGROES IN MASS MEDIA
A NATIONWIDE survey of American
newspapers, magazines, and radio and
television broadcasters disclosed last
week that Negroes made up only 4.2
percent of their staffs, but that most
of these employers were “actively seek-
ing” more. (Negroes compose roughly'
ten percent of the U.S. population.)
The survey, by the Columbia Uni-
versity journalism “Review,” covered
only “white-collar” workers in the edi-
torial, advertising, business, and promo-
tion fields. Had it covered printers,
press-men, and other “blue-collar”
workers, the percentage of Negro
employees would have been even lower,
the review pointed out, because of dis-
criminatory practices of some printing
unions.
“The media have become aware of
shortcomings (in hiring Negroes) after
decades of neglect,” the “Review” com-
mented, “and have begun to recognise
their responsibility in the quest for
better race relations in America. But
only when coverage of Negroes in the
U.S. as well as stories about the
relationship between blacks and whites
becomes an everyday phenomenon and
not just a ‘special’—only then will this
country have arrived at a point where
prejudice will no longer exist in the
mass media.”
The editor of the Washington “Post”
was quoted in the survey as stating
that “most American newspapers are
not reporting the story of the American
city—either because they don’t want to
or they don’t know how.” An official
of “Time” magazine agreed, saying,
“If you wish to see anything of Negro
social life or of the home life of Negro
achievers, it is necessary to turn to the
Negro Press.”
FRONT-PAGE JESUS
THE “BULLET,” a student newspaper
at Mary Washington College in
Virginia, last week carried a front-page
picture of Jesus Christ in the form of a
“criminal wanted” poster, accompanied
by the headline: “Warning—this man is
dangerous—especially to the young—a

The issue, which drew both praise
and criticism from local clergymen and
in the Press, went on to say that Jesus
was wanted for conspiring to obstruct
the draft by requiring followers not to
kill, practising medicine and wine-
making without a licence, and interfer-
ing with businessmen in a temple.
“Jesus is anti-capitalist,” the news-
paper said. “He urges followers to sell
everything and give to the poor. He
urges love, not war, and love of every-
body, including Communists.” It
described his appearance as “typical
hippie beard, long hair, sandals,
young,” adding He “may be encoun-
tered in any slum pad, love-in, or anti-
war demonstration, but was less often
seen in church or suburbia.”
The issue was largely the work of
the 20-year-old editor Susan Wagner,
who said, “We think it’s the most
Christian thing we’ve ever done.”
END-GAME POLITICS
MORE AND MORE Americans
Negroes, students, unionists, and others
are playing “the politics of confron-
tation,” which could eventually threaten
a breakdown in the democratic process,
the “New York Times” pointed out
last week. In New York city, for
example, the strikes, slowdowns, and
threats by teachers, policemen, firemen,
electric-power-company employees, wel-
fare workers, and students during the
past few months form part of a pattern
that is straining the structure of the
unions, Government, and society itself.
But there are evidences that Govern-
ment, responding to growing public
apprehension over what is happening,
will soon react. The New York State
Legislature is expected to enact stiffer
penalties in its Taylor Law, which was
designed to end strikes by public
employees, but has been almost a total
failure. This kind of punitive legisla-
tion is expected to restrain union
leaders who have been openly flouting
anti-strike laws. These leaders now
realise that illegal strikes are forcing
cities to move toward automation and
to the contracting of many city services,
such as garbage disposal, to private
corporations.
However, the roots of “confrontation”
go deeper than the aspirations of
workers for higher wages and more
fringe benefits.
The “Times” says these roots can be
found in:
The deep social malaise that results
in attacks on the “power structure” of
the establishment.
The restive younger generation
groping for a more meaningful society
and sceptical that the established
democratic process can achieve it.
The “revolution” sparked by militant
blacks, who resent the years of tokenism
and half-measures in granting them
full equality, are now moving to seize
by force what the Constitution guaran-
tees them.


The by-election that shook Paradise
By SHIRLEY BARKER
TO SOME PEOPLE Paradise is a
group of 300-odd islands lying less than
2000 miles from Sydney. It is called
Fiji, and in school atlases it is a com-
forting shade of British pink. How
long it will remain that color is a
question being asked greedily by some
and studiously avoided by others. Fiji
is bedevilled by racialism, but a
racialism that comes from politics
rather than an all-out dislike of each
other by the various races there.
Last month saw the opening of a new
session of the Fiji Legislative Council,
Fiji’s Parliament. It could also be the
opening of a new chapter in the
Colony’s political history. In power is
the Alliance, not strictly a political
Party, rather a collection of Parties,
led by Ratu K. K. T. Mara, a British-
educated Fijian chief. The Alliance
consists mainly of Fijians and Euro-
peans, and some Indians. The Feder-
ation Party is largely Indian and is led
by a tireless and highly intelligent'
Indian lawyer, Ambalal Dahyabhai
Patel. Of the 36 elected seats in the
Council, Alliance holds 26, Federation
nine, and there is now one independent
who broke away from the Alliance this
month to form a new Liberal Party.
Things were relatively rosy in
Paradise until September, 1967. A
London conference in 1965 had ham-
mered out a new constitution for Fiji
which was hailed by most as a triumph
of orderly progression toward self-
government at some later, though
undefined, date. Independence was
hardly mentioned. The constitution
provided for Fiji’s own cabinet, led by
its own chief minister. The system of
voting was revised and included a
method of cross-voting which has
become the most attacked and most
defended item in the whole document.
After ten months of government
under the new constitution, Mr. Patel
brought a motion before the Council
for a conference to work out a new
constitution, “based on true democratic
principles without any bias or distinc-
tion on the grounds of color, race,
religion, or place of origin, or vested
interest; either political, economic,
social, or other so that Fiji may attain
self-government and become a nation
with honor, dignity, and responsibility
as soon as possible.” Mr. Patel
described the current constitution as
“undemocratic, iniquitous, and unjust.”
It was not the Federation Party’s
first attack on the constitution, but it
was the first of what may turn out to
be a series of strategic moves on the
part of the Opposition to bulldoze its
policies along. In the debate immedi-
ately following the motion, the nine
Federation members walked out and
boycotted the Council thereafter. After
missing three meetings of the Council,
they forfeited their seats and a by-
election for those nine seats became
necessary.
The most widely accepted view is
that Fiji’s problems began in 1879
when the first Indian arrived. Yet it
could be that it all began when the
first white man was allowed to stay on
those idyllic islands for longer than it
took to obtain fresh water and victuals
for his wooden ship. Whatever the
view, Indians ai'e now a fact of Fiji
life. Between 1879 and 1916, some
60,000 of them were brought in under
an indentured labor agreement made
with the Indian Government for
Indians to work the sugarcane planta-
tions. Fijians neither needed nor
wanted the work. When the indenture
system was abandoned in 1916, 40,000
Indians elected to remain as free
settlers. Today there are 241,000 and
they constitute more than half the
entire population. Fijians, themselves,
A. D. Patel
Ralu Mara
account for little over 202,000, Euro-
peans for 6500, part-Europeans 9600,
Chinese 5000, and other Pacific
Islanders for nearly 12,000. Population
is rising despite the vigorous efforts of
the Family Planning Association
giving away free inter-uterine loops
and selling contraceptive pills at a
shilling a packet.
Only the European population is
dwindling, due to the fact that more
locally born people are slowly taking
over the government jobs held by
British, Australian, and New Zealand
expatriates a planned development.
The Chinese, generally, keep well out
of politics, working hard and minding
their own business. Other Pacific
Islanders and part-Europeans are rela-
tively apathetic to politics, though they
are inclined to side with the Fijians,
with whom they have a natural rap-
port. The recent racial confrontations
have been mainly between the Indians
and Fijians, with the Europeans almost
solidly backing the latter.
With its boycott of the Legislative
Assembly, the Federation Party achieved
its immediate objective: a by-election,
the results of which, it claimed, would
show that the people were behind the
demands for a new constitution. Few
believed the claim.
The nine vacated seats were from
the 12 elected seats allotted to Indians
(the remaining three are held by Alli-
ance 1 Indians). Fijians have 14 elected
seats, and Europeans the same number,
with all other races lumped in with
them. Each voter in a general election
has four votes: for a candidate of his
own racial group standing in the elec-
torate where he resides; for an Indian;
for a Fijian; for one “general” candi-
date in the special, larger cross-voting
electorate.
Only Indians voted in the by-election.
All candidates were Indian, standing
for Federation, Alliance, or as Indepen-
dents. Biggest question throughout the
campaign was whether the Indian voters
would plump for the multi-racial
Alliance or for the Indian-dominated
Federation. If the latter, it would
reinforce the view that if Fiji adopted
a one-man-one-vote system, there was
an acute danger of Indians dominating
the government. The complex system of
voting, called “communal roll,” was
devised to counter any one race taking
power. The Federation Party, on the
other hand, maintains that the system
accentuates racial differences, and that
only “common roll” (one-man-one-vote)
will diminish racialism and “weld Fiji
into a truly democratic nation.” How-
ever, the Federation Party said it was
willing to invite an election based on
the “communal-roll” system.
The result staggered Fiji. Federation
candidates swept back with greater
majorities than in the 1966 general
election. Some 76,000 Indians were
eligible to vote, and 59,786 did so.
Federation won nearly 47,000 of them,
Alliance 12,826.
During the campaign, the Federation
Party had been noisy, irreverent, and
militant. The Alliance, on the other
hand, had been comparatively quiet.
The Alliance was confident of success
at the polls. After the election there
was a complete volte face. The Federa-
tion Party became quiet, astonished
itself, perhaps, at the turn of events.
The Alliance called the result “a dis-
appointment,” and said it was a setback
for tolerance and orderly progression
toward self-government. But the Fijian
Association, a political organisation and
the prime component of the Alliance,
embarked on a series of bitter verbal
attacks against Indians.
The Association held a rash of meet-
ings throughout Fiji, at which the nor-
mally easy-going, tolerant Fijians called
for deportation of Indians and of Mr.
Patel and his supporters; surveillance
of any Indians whose activities were
considered “not consistent with the
general desire for good neighborliness
and good race relations”; compulsory


birth control for Indians, with deporta-
tion the penalty for having more than
three children. The words “force” and
“violence” were used, probably for the
first time by Fijians for nearly a cen-
tury. They called for the repeal of a
new Act which made land easier to
lease (the Act mainly benefited Indian
farmers seeking more land or longer
terms), and for the withdrawal of the
right of non-Fijians to sit on the Native
Land Trust Board, which administers
all Fijian-owned land.
The emphasis on land at the meetings
points up the importance of its posses-
sion in Fiji. Fijians own more than
80 percent of the land, and the word
“taukei,” meaning owners of the land,
is frequently used in place of the word
“Fijian.” They cling tenaciously to
their land, knowing that with it goes
the ownership of Fiji itself.
Another reason for the Fijian fury,
one that is fully understood by anyone
who knows the country, was what they
called “the disrespectful and out-
rageous remarks” made about their
chiefs during the election campaign.
Throughout the furore, the voice of
the Fijian Association’s President, Ratu
Mara, was missing. He declined all
discussion of the subject, believing that
silence should prevail until tempers
had cooled. Many observers believed
he could have used his enormous
influence over the Fijians to quell the
heat as it rose. And some go as far as
to say Ratu Mara was playing a
delicate game of brinkmanship:
allowing full rein to the Fijian fury to
show the Federation Party what could
be unleashed, with the knowledge he
could control the situation any time he
chose. As tempers did cool and a few
words of sense became injected in the
meetings, Ratu Mara made a public
statement.
He said the Fijian people “feel
betrayed and alarmed.” He listed eight
“mileposts of Fijian concessions,” which
included the Agricultural Landlord and
Tenant Act, urged for repeal, and
Fijian acceptance of cross-voting
instead of the previous communal vot-
ing only. He described the concessions
as “friendly and trusting,” that they had
meant “a sacrifice of security and an
abandonment of the bulwarks on which
Fijians relied to maintain their rights
and position in their own land.” He
concluded: “Let there be no violence,
but let it be clearly understood that
the Fijian people have spoken in no
uncertain terms, and they cannot and
must not be ignored.”
The Federation Party remains
unswervingly on a course headed for
“common roll” voting and indepen-
dence. Mr. Patel says self-government
is not enough, that British colonial
government must be broken. But adds
he’d be quite happy to see Fiji remain
in the British Commonwealth, “but
like Australia is.” He wants to see the
end of the hereditary power of the
Fijian chiefs, saying it is holding back
the political and economic education
of the Fijian people. He accuses the
British of fostering the Chief system,
which he describes as “feudal,” as part
of “Britain’s usual practice in colonies
of divide and rule.” Britain’s role in
Fiji, he says, is to drive a wedge
between the Indian and Fijian people
to keep them separated. He insists that
Indians and Fijians share a common
background of segregation from, and
complete control by, Europeans in
Fiji in the past. Reminded that there
is no segregation now and that Fiji
is on the road to self-government, he
replies: “But it’s taken 90 years to
achieve that.” Mr. Patel’s stubborn
resistance to Britain may be explained
in part by the fact that aside from a
period of law education in London he
has lived under British colonial rule
all his life. He was born in India in
1905, when the British Raj was at its
zenith, and he went to Fiji in 1929 to
a similar situation. During the war he
was interned for two years for his
part in the battle of sugarcane farmers
seeking higher prices for sugar in 1942.
But he dismisses any idea of bitterness
on this score, saying: “That was a long
time ago.” He says he formed the
Federation Party in 1959 “because I
was interested in the sugarcane
farmers.” There are about 13,000 of
these farmers, who, with their depen-
dants, make up nearly 100,000 Indians.
Mr. Patel says “racialism must be
wiped out,” and vehemently denies the
Federation Party is fostering the evil
even though the “Pacific Review”
newspaper, which supports the Party,
frequently makes odious distinctions
between “whites” and others. He says
the Party has no financial holding in
the newspaper, but defends it on the
grounds that it is fighting the prejudice
of the country’s only English-language
daily, the “Fiji Times.”
The Alliance, on the other hand,
backed solidly by Britain, maintains
that only a gradual progression toward
self-government will save Fiji from a
fate similar to that of a number of
former colonies given their indepen-
dence too early. Britain has said the
latest constitutional reform will not be
the last; that there will be more before
self-government is achieved. The year
1974 is often guessed as the time when
Fiji will gain self-government with
probably one more constitutional
change before then. That will be the
centenary of cession to Britain, and
would make a neat end to one hundred
years of British rule in the colony.
Both sides have a number of facts
to face and problems to solve. Fiji
must face the fact that the Federation
Party is here to stay; too many Euro-
peans tend to dismiss it as a rabble-
rousing minority. Then there is a fact
that most Fijians are sadly ill equipped
to cope with self-government within a
generation; there are virtually no Fijian
businessmen, for example, who could
provide even a grounding for political
authority. It is a fact that the hereditary
chiefs are still all-important to the
Fijian people. This makes for orderly
Fijian society and security for the aver-
age Fijian, but it does not equip him
for the relative sophistication of democ-
racy. And if Fijian Chiefs subscribe to
the Party system of government and
wish to stand as candidates in elections,
they may well have to take harsh words
and disrespect.
The Federation Party must face the
fact that Fiji is progressing and devel-
oping, even if the pace seems slow.
And if it views the chiefs as obstacles
in its battle to win the hearts and minds
of the Fijians, it must remember that
by and large the chiefs take their
responsibilities seriously. Ratu Mara, a
wealthy and powerful chief in his own
right, sincerely believes in taking his
people toward self-government. And it
cannot be lost on him that it may lead
eventually to the breaking down of
effective rule-by-chief in the villages and
provinces.
Fiji also must realise that the Indians
are numerically in the ascendant and
have contributed much to Fiji’s current
prosperity; that there is a natural wish
for more voice in government. On the
other hand, Indians must realise—and
many already do—that Fiji belongs to
its indigenous people both historically
and legally. The Fijians maintain it is
they who ceded their country to Britain,
and only they who can ask for its
return.
Finally, the Europeans, who wield
enormous economic power there, may
have to change their own view of the
two major races in Fiji. “The only
thing wrong with Fiji is the Indians,”
is a sentiment expressed by James A.
Michener in his “Return to Paradise,”
and is still echoed by many Europeans
over their pre-dinner drinks. The per-
petuation of such an assumption does
nothing to help Fiji’s problems. True,
the intense, astute Indians do not shine
in European eyes like the happy-go-
lucky, smiling Fijians. Indians in Fiji
are reminiscent of the Jews in Europe;
they work hard, will sacrifice anything
for the education of a son, and have
boundless ambition to better themselves.
The Fijians, on the other hand, are
blessed with fun-loving dispositions and
an insouciance which blends perfectly
with their natural dignity, and appeals
mightily to Anglo-Saxons. The average
Fijian is quite happy for the European
to make decisions for him, which is
gratifying, indeed.
Despite their enormous differences
of character, Fijians and Indians left
alone together get on pretty well. They
drink kava convivially and eat curry
together. Many Indians speak better
Fijian than they do Hindu (the major
Indian language). They do not usually
intermarry, but they grow up together.
At village level, the problems are not
insurmountable. They become more
complex farther up the scale at the
very point where Fiji has insufficient
leaders and executives, of the right
calibre, of all the races.


SCHOOL-LEAVERS:
TOMORROW’S JOBS
TODAY
By RICHARD CAMPBELL
IT IS NOW 65 years since Joseph
Furphy began his rambling, stringy-
bark epic “Such is Life,” published by
The Bulletin, with the words
“Unemployed at last!” Whether this
sentiment reflected a real attitude of the
day is anybody’s guess: yarn-spinners
are not always reliable sociologists. Still,
the myth developed. The typical Aus-
tralian could work like a demon when
he had to, but he knew when to stop.
Work, like the boss, was not to be taken
seriously, and preferably both should be
avoided.
The whole thesis, however, may have
been the biggest furphy of them all, and
if the myth is still propagated to justify
a cheerful laziness it is rapidly dying.
In pre-technological Australia the job
is no joke. The questions “What will
you do?” and “What will you be?” are
not asked lightly. They are not only
always relevant, they are vitally per-
tinent. And as the questions are used
synonymously they probe not only a
young person’s aspirations, ideals,
capacities, and social ambitions, but
also that person’s sense of identity. One
chooses not just something to work at,
but a role, a ready-packed set of social
greasepaints.
Today, when everyone “works,” when
the working wife and the working
mother are commonplace, and when
the wealthy would not dream of con-
tinuous leisure, social position and
identity are closely linked to the par-
ticular occupation. As points of identity,
class, church, family, mode of leisure,
sparetime intellectual pursuits are now
shadowy appendages rather than cen-
trally determining facts. To the world
in general a person is not first a
Methodist, a member of the Jones
family, a squash player, or an intel-
lectual. To introduce someone in those
terms alone would be odd, tasteless, or
offensive, and only the most arrant
snob could think a class-label a sufficient
description of anybody.
Apart from the subtleties of special
circles, in Australia social position is
measured and esteem given on the basis
of professional or financial success. The
society of the social pages is less and
less the society of “old” families; it is
more the society of the wives of “top”
men, or more often would-be “top” men.
The lustre of “old” names is kept bright
only by the ability of their scions to
compete in the new terms. The cities
no longer bow to the country. Name or
connections alone count for nothing.
Being on the top depends on top per-
formance or what passes for top
performance.
As institutions expand and solidify,
old allegiances are placed under strain.
The man chosen as an apprentice,
school-leaver, or graduate is asked to be
not just an employee; he is tantalised
with the carrot of quick promotions,
executive status, and the ultimate ambi-
tion —the position of managing director.
Although some may have more equal
opportunities than others, all are told
on joining the company that they will
have an equal opportunity of reaching
the top and that this ambition is in fact
the prime qualification for the job. This
pinnacle or another iike it may be the
man’s chief concern or interest until he
retires. Hence identification becomes as
much vertical as horizontal. The
employee, especially the young
employee, is required to think as much
about the future as of the present. Class
distinctions in these institutions become
less 1 significant when attainment is
stripped bare of almost everything
except contribution to the pinnacle’s
well-being.
Job mobility also becomes a fact of
life and is generally recognised as a
sign of advancement. This also eats into
the older, more permanent social
groupings of class and family.
It is necessary to make these points
about change in Australia before talking
about what the present generation of
school-leavers will want in the world
because the two are connected, and
because their parents do not always
realise it.
Thousands of late-secondary students
are confidently anticipating a society of
large and rapid rewards. Far from
expecting to be mere jobholders, they
expect their “career,” “profession,” or
“occupation” to bring more than money.
Of if they do not expect wider, richer
opportunities than their fathers had
they at least believe the opportunities
will appear more swiftly and that their
advancement will be more rapid.
Career counsellors, school counsellors,
and vocational-guidance experts speak
in virtual uniformity of this changed
level of expectations and they warn
of the problem of parents who are
simply unaware of the economic,
institutional, and social changes around
them, who still believe in the com-
paratively static world of their formative
years, a world of “there’ll always be
work of some kind,” “enough schooling
to get by,” and “a job is just' a way
of earning a quid, nothing more.”
Careers masters in the less prosperous
areas are continually astounded by the
number of parents who take absolutely
no interest in the progress of their
children at school and little more in
the choice of their children’s careers.
The parents of the top quarter of the
class encourage their teenagers to
think around the matter or contribute
by appearing at “careers nights” or
some other way, but the parents of
the less able scholars in countless cases
leave the whole thing to chance —' a
heated argument one evening around the
kitchen table or a sudden rush to school
at the last minute, expecting some
quick advice to direct their son or
daughter into a cushy job.
Catch-as-catch-can was a possible
attitude 20 years ago, when the majority
of schoolchildren did not go much
beyond primary school and around 80
percent left when they were 14. There
was a sort of equality in lost oppor-
tunities in this. The competition is now
far more intense: 60 percent of school
students stay on until their fifth year
of secondary school.
New South Wales provides an
example of the rapidity of the change.
The introduction of the new secondary
course has meant that the number of
third-form leavers, to take one group,


had dropped since 1963 from represent-
ing 64 percent of all those who left
school in their second, third, or fourth
year to 34 percent of those three forms
by the end of 1965. Fourth - form
leavers had dropped in the same
period from being 6 percent of this
group to 40 percent.
The social consequences of this up-
grading are obvious. As abilities rise, so
do aspirations. To some degree it can
be said that this generation is being
educated, while their parents were
merely schooled.
Those parents who don’t see (or fail
to understand) the import of the
“education explosion” are also blind to
how rapidly jobs are changing. Some
have disappeared, many more have
become more complex or changed in
function, and some, the spawn of the
new technology, have sprung up over-
night. In the absence of advice about
this, parents will pass on to their
children assumptions and beliefs that
have little or no relation to the world
their children will be entering.
It is misleading to tell a child today
that work can only be a rotten chore,
just boring and hard yakka, something
to keep in its place, not bring home, and
something that in general should not
be allowed to keep concentration from
the horses, beer, footy, clothes, and the
hols. It is equally misleading to urge
him to success by “coming up the hard
way.”
If there is still a “hard way” it is not
the same old universal “hard way.” Now
there is another hard way of night
school, technical qualifications after
apprenticeship, service training and re-
training, more money, more responsi-
bility, and bigger headaches. And this is
the only “way.” The boss of yesterday
might once have been the messenger
boy, but the boss of tomorrow is an
apprentice who is doing further study;
a clerk doing a part-time accountancy
course; the bright young chap seconded
to the management training school.
In those schools which do place a
high value on experiment and the
introduction of the most modern
teaching methods, the career-guidance
service approaches the ideal which the
better American schools try to meet, of
one counsellor for every 250 secondary
students. In Victoria the Student
Christian Movement has accepted coun-
selling as “on the frontiers of experi-
mental educational work.” A special
pilot project will be held at Essendon
Technical School this month to help to
fill “the most crying need of all.”
But unfortunately the all-too-infre-
quent counselling at many schools is
done by a teacher who is attempting to
sandwich his or her concern about a
child’s working future between bouts of
yard duty, form duty, house super-
vision, sports organisation, and the large
load of paperwork which is the lot of
every teacher. It is true that there is a
large supply of mediocre and many
good films which a. careers master or
mistress can show during third- or
fourth-form classes; many industries
encourage tours; many speakers make
regular runs of the schools. But all these
sorts of activities involve much time-
consuming organisation and many
teachers haven’t got the time. There is
a very obvious contrast between the
meticulous care lavished on some chil-
dren’s futures and the often indifferent
treatment many teenagers receive in
this aspect of their preparation for a
working life.
Alan Eustace, a senior psychologist
in the Victorian Youth Guidance sec-
tion of the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service, expresses amazement
about the widespread indifference to
skilled counselling. “People are always
talking and writing about the cost to
the community of the high university
failure rate, but less than five percent
of youngsters reach the universities.
Why doesn’t someone talk about the
failure rate of those youngsters entering
their first year of work?” Mr. Eustace
sees careers advising as a matter of
commonsense and communication, not
expertise. “After all, it’s a very normal,
natural, ordinary, and inevitable thing.”
Some States are better in this than
others. Guidance in N.S.W. schools
seems less haphazard than it is in the
Government schools in other States. In
N.S.W. a counsellor in each high school
acts for all the schools in the district
and is consulted by the various careers
advisers on difficult problems. The
Department of Education has its Divi-
sion of Guidance and Adjustment, and
the Department of Technical Education
has its own staff of more than 20 full-
time officers.
N.S.W. also has a Vocational Guid-
ance Bureau, which aims to give
guidance to anyone over 14 who seeks
it. The Bureau gives vocational-
guidance tests to all pupils over 14 in
Government schools and in some
private schools. In 1966-67 the Bureau
gave more than 11,000 interviews and
more than 72,000 tests. As well as this,
the N.S.W. Education Department
arranges camps, where detailed discus-
sion and questioning can take place.
Victoria has an Employment Service
which acts both as a counselling and
placement service. It also organises
“Careers Advisory Days,” seminars, and
large-scale excursions called “Trains of
Knowledge” for country students. The
“Schools Employment Program” in the
Victorian Department attempts to con-
tact every school-leaver in his last year
at school by group talks, individual
counselling, and then, if necessary, more
detailed, prolonged counselling.
The special arrangements made in
some State's for country students can
be particularly valuable. The range of
occupations country children meet in
their everyday experience is more
narrow, and while career pamphlets,
books, and institutional publications are
easily obtained, and all but the most
negligent school would have enough
pamphlets to give them some idea of
the scope of choice, these pamphlets are
no substitute for talking to the people
who do the work.
The other main avenue for career
information is through the Common-
wealth Employment Service. State
Education Departments generally
tend to rely on the Commonwealth
Service and to use their special branches
for the problem areas of counselling.
But the governmental agencies are
criticised for failing to keep in close
contact with employers. Department
heads, however, are reluctant to cut
down on the workload for anything so
intangible as “greater knowledge.”
But however good or bad these
extra-mural services are, they end up as
heing as good or bad as the teachers
who are the child’s main contact. And
apart from the inadequate time avail-
able for careers counselling in many
schools there is another problem: many
teachers have little sympathy for the
“work world.”
With few exceptions, they go from
A random selection of careers leaflets
issued by the N.S.W. Vocational Guid-
ance Service
school to training college or university
and then return to a school, having
gained no wide experience of the work
world and perhaps with ingrained
prejudices against some forms of work
or an exaggerated partiality to their
own. Mr. Justice Beattie, in his monu-
mental 950 - page inquiry into *the
apprenticeship system in New South
Wales, regarded this as “a very real
danger.” He believed some teachers
consciously and unconsciously down-
graded the prospects of apprenticeship
because they were unaware of both the
importance of the training and the
prospects for practical and skilled young
men in administration, sales, and
production.
In the same way not all girls’
advisers can provide good enough
warning against the pitfalls of the
employment cliches. As no girl today
would dream of helping at home until
the suitor arrives, the careers mistress
has the invidious responsibility of
advising on the short-stay occupations,
considering what skills the girl will need
when she seeks employment again in
ten years’ time. These rosy, unreal
notions about nursing or kindergarten
teaching, for example, might have to
be corrected. On the other hand, there


are apprenticeships like instrument-
making and several involving design
skills that are consistently overlooked
and yet which may be a good deal
more challenging than serving coffee
to smiling bosses in their deathlessly
air-conditioned offices. And many
careers mistresses do not face up to
the problem of the girl who wants to
do Arts but doesn’t want to teach,
or doesn’t know what she wants to do.
In complete contrast to many of the
country’s schools where vocational
guidance is the most neglected and
abused part of the school’s life, the
better non-Government schools have in
the last decade or less put much effort
into the provision of career libraries,
qualified counsellors, parent-teacher-
child contact, and the setting aside of
time for consistent, step-by-step guid-
ance through a youngster’s school
career.
Career counselling is all the more
necessary in these affluent schools if
only for one reason: these students are
generally under much greater pressure
to make choices, and make choices of
which their parents approve. The guid-
ance of a teacher can take off some of
the parental pressure by being more
responsive to and objective about the
needs of the boy and girl.
An attitude which plagues careers
masters and counsellors is that of the
parent who has invested hundreds of
dollars in his son’s education, only to
find that the school hasn’t delivered the
goods. A battery of psychological, intelli-
gence, and aptitude tests (which the best
schools provide) may have convinced
the careers teacher and the boy that
he is cut out for practical work and
would be wasted, frustrated, and stifled
in clerical or sub-professional work, but
parents will not accept it. To a profes-
sional man or a man on the rise this
is often seen as a humiliating insult; a
loss of face which must be avoided at
all costs. The boy may have once said
he would like to be a brain surgeon like
Ben Casey, and on that the hopes of
the family are built. When the inevitable
question pops up as every succeeding
aunt visits, the gleaming answer is there
like a flash, affording much satisfaction
to all alike.
Counsellors also recognise that there
is a danger that a school or individual
teachers can be just as bad as some
parents in laying false stress on the all-
important choice. Mr. Bellshaw, the
head counsellor at the Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology, tells the story
of a class he visited in which every one
of the boys had decided what he would
“be.” Greatly surprised, he asked one
boy what career he would follow and he
replied, “Civil engineering.” Mr. Bell-
shaw asked, “Why not chemical
engineering, mechanical engineering,
mining, electrical, or production
engineering?” It turned out that the
master had once said civil engineering
would be a good thing for the boy, and
from then on the boy’s future was laid
out.
Another bugaboo of the counsellor is
the employer who, sensing the import-
ance of “education,” decides that since
he wants the “best” people for his
show, the minimum educational level
will be raised. The employer offers the
money and prospects and yet is some-
times disappointed to find that the new
man or woman was not what he was
looking for. Thoroughness, punctuality,
neatness was what the employer was
looking for, but he asked for examina-
tion marks. This is a conflict which
continually harasses educationists.
Teachers are trying to treat their
charges as individuals with many
strengths and many failings, and yet the
community expects the product to be
able to jump through certain arbitrary
hoops. Closer co-operation between
employers, vocational counsellors,
careers advisers, parents, and youth
could help to obviate these problems.
Even “careers nights” visits by
employers and excursions to local
industry although they help in some
ways and although they form a major
part of the career guidance provided by
most schools can never the less be
superficial. Some employers feel their
visits are treated as post-exam enter-
tainment or as films for off-peak times
of the year. Excursions can be a needed
break from books and lessons, but how
much they teach a 15-year-old who is
on the look-out for something to
souvenir is imponderable.
Mr. Bellshaw believes that the activi-
ties should not be treated as even par-
tially adequate. He thinks of teaching
as one of the most relevant ways of
preparing children for work. A good
teacher of any subject, he believes,
should be equally capable of instilling
respect for the pure subject and interest
in its practical application. Education
is more than individual subjects. It can
involve a total apprehension of the
wider world and its relation to the
individual. “The education system as it
has developed seems to enjoy making
gaps. We must bridge these gaps, and
that requires a team effort.”
Ideally, the careers counsellor will be
someone who has had working experi-
ence in the outside world; wide know-
ledge of the work done in a score of
fields; an entirely accurate knowledge of
the pre-conditions and educational
requirements for a great many training
courses; and someone who is quite
impartial in the role of counsellor.
The function of the counsellor is not
to “place” the youth so much as to
direct him to the “field” which seems
to most tie-in with the person’s profile
of capacities. The actual decision should
be left as late as possible, savs Warren
Man, the careers adviser at Melbourne’s
Monash University.
He believes that neither the vocational-
guidance expert nor the more practical-
minded careers adviser can draw up a
blueprint of a person’s capacities or
intelligence and that it is a vast mistake
to imply to youth that the first choice
is the only one. “It is terribly important
that the school-leavers see that their
futures will develop as a dynamic thing
and not as something pre-ordained,” he
says. “After all, there are damn few of
us whose career has been just as we
planned it at school.”
In a society that has quite suddenly
started to change rapidly there is no
precise information about the form the
change will take, who it will affect, or
what retraining will be necessary.
Flexibility, a readiness to gain
further qualifications, an awareness of
the dangers of early specialisation
become important attitudes to inculcate.
If the experience of the electrical
and electronics industries holds good
for other industries, the majority of
Australia’s technicians appear to be men
who gained all their know-how in the
plant. As factual knowledge leaps for-
ward, technical courses will have to
remain generalist to cope with funda-
mentals, thus leaving specialisation to
the on-job experience. Flexibility
applies to the brilliant scholar as much
as to the duffer. The mentally less
dexterous bricklayer may miss oppor-
tunities by not moving into insulation
laying just as the Ph.D. may miss a
good chance in administration while
satisfying his self - esteem in pure
research.
The notion of the “calling,” that
fundamental element of the puritan
ethic, is still a very real and alive
attitude of the sprawling, ever-
expanding Australian middle - classes.
Almost unconsciously faith, duty, and
work intermingle. Faith is expressed
not merely by regular church attendance
but by a steady, conscientious dedication
to work, business, and self-improve-
ment. But “one’s vocation,” as
expressed in these terms, does not
entirely correspond to the pressures,
anxieties, or ideals of a younger
generation. Many vocational counsellors
sense a new ethic which places greater
emphasis on work as a “rewarding”
activity, as “creative,” or as a place
where a person can be himself. It is,
perhaps, a developing ethic which
anticipates that work need not “build
character” but extend character. It
may bring freedoms of expression
unexpected and undemanded by a
previous generation.


CHEAP REFFO LABOR
Eva Jelinkova is one of the Czech refugees who finds Australia great fun
“WE ASKED what the possibilities
were in Australia, and when we gave
our professions we were told that we
would not have a worry. I asked
specifically if we would actually be
able to work as doctors, but he said
there was no question about it. When
we said that we had no English, he
kept on reassuring us that it wouldn’t
matter a damn. We said that we would
consider doing nursing jobs for the time
being, but he laughed and brushed it
aside. Now I am working in a hospital
as a ward helper, doing jobs like wash-
ing pans, wheeling patients around . . .
I didn’t expect this. I didn’t expect that
I would start as a doctor immediately,
but this . . .”
A married Czechoslovakian doctor
was explaining, through an interpreter,
why she and her husband were less
than happy about their first few months
in Australia. Having left everything
behind in Prague after they left their
country, they have found themselves in
a difficult position. The Australian Gov-
ernment had been kind enough to
provide them with a free ticket to Aus-
tralia and accommodation since, but
they had been misled.
They had thought of Australia when,
after the August invasion, Czech cur-
rency was almost worthless in Austria,
where most of the refugees went. Con-
sequently, she and her husband found
their 5000 crowns had melted away
overnight. This left them no option
but to leave Vienna quickly for a place
where they could resume their careers
and make a fresh start. The Australian
officials in Vienna gave them pamphlets
which made “very advantageous offers,”
and they soon realised that Australia
offered the swiftest departure from
Vienna. The officials were courteous,
helpful, and their efficiency made a
good impression. The doctor, a woman
in her mid-30s, continued telling the
translator about some incidents which
typified the way they had been treated
in Australia.
“One day a patient came in with
an infection which is rare in Czecho-
slovakia, and medically it was a very
interesting case. I wanted to have a
look at his papers. Immediately I began,
a nurse reprimanded me . . . she knew
I was a doctor in Czechoslovakia.”
Her husband, a gynaecologist, is also
working at a hospital as a medical
orderly. Friends advised him to work
at a hospital because he would then
continue in a hospital milieu and have
a chance to make social contact with
Australian doctors. “So far no one has
taken the slightest interest in me.
“We didn’t expect Australian doctors
to be concerned about us, but we did
expect to be treated as if we were
doctors. In Europe, doctors meet as
doctor to doctor, no matter what their
nationality happens to be.”
The couple (they would not allow
their names to be used, perhaps out of
an unjustifiable fear of bureaucratic
reprisal) are now resigning themselves
to a lengthy and unhappy period before
they can begin to practise their profes-
sion again. Until they speak fluent
English they will not be able to sit
for the Medical Board examinations,
and while they continue to do dreary
manual work to feed themselves they
are unable to learn English quickly.
They go to English lessons twice a
week, but are too tired to go more
often, and, in any case, they find it is
not the sort of language class they
would find most useful. They need to
know the correct usage and grammar,
not the simplified colloquial version
that is taught to classes consisting of
Greek and Italian fishermen and Czech
scientists and medical doctors.
For both, this waiting period means
a decline in their knowledge and skills.
For the gynaecologist it will mean his
hands will become less supple and lose
some of their touch. “If you put the
mildest interpretation on what we were
promised in Vienna,” they concluded,
“it was a gross overstatement of what
we found here.”
Their story was a sorry contrast to
two stories told by a fellow refugee,
Miko, an electronics engineer and com-
puter designer who is also doing
manual labor and has as yet only a
little' English. He compared the experi-
ence of the doctors to that of a refugee
friend of his who went to Sweden. This
man, also a medical doctor, was given
a three-month course in Swedish, his
family was kept on a comfortable
allowance, and when his three months
are up he will be sent to a clinic. After
six months in the clinic he will be
allowed to begin private practice.
Another friend, also an electronics
engineer, chose the United States. He
quickly found a job with an electronics
firm in their research department,
although he had no English. Both
friends, unlike Miko, were working in
their own profession only months after
leaving Czechoslovakia, and so both
have had continuity in their profes-
sional work. They didn’t become stale.
Canada, like Sweden, has also
found a procedure for quickly taking
advantage of the skills of these
people. A third friend of Miko is in
Toronto: the Government has paid for
a hotel: a job was assigned to him: he
has been given the opportunity to
attend a language school and he is
paid an adequate stipend to maintain
his family during this period. He does
not have to repay the stipend. Miko’s
comment was predictable: “It is an
enormous luxury for a country to
employ people with qualifications as
manual laborers.” He thought that not
a single one of his friends would have
come to Australia if the speed of
acceptance had been the same for all
countries.
Miko’s story is not typical, of the
scientist refugees or of the skilled
tradesmen, particularly the metal and
electrical tradesmen which Australia
has lapped up, but because his quali-
fications are too specialised, his experi-
ence has been similar to that of people
who have few • qualifications or the
wrong sort of qualifications.
Miko was in Belgrade at the time
of the invasion, and made inquiries
there about Australian conditions.
There, he was told that accommodation
was provided and work was easily
obtainable. He took a gamble and was
soon in Sydney. The next day saw
him in the Victorian migrant centre,
Bonegilla, which is for refugees without
transport, in the middle of nowhere,
and on the following day he was inter-
viewed by the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service officer.
He was told that for the time being
they couldn’t find him any work, not
even manual work. English'classes were
provided once a day, but Miko, being
multi-lingual, found them to be inade-
quate and too simple. He eventually
found himself a job with a German
firm, because he happens to speak
German. The distressing aspect of this
situation is the amount of time he will
spend in a limbo away from his area
of technology. If the Government could
only provide a loan, he said, he could
take an intensive course in English,
and with the salary he could soon

command he would be able to pay it
back quickly. “Everyone would benefit.”
For many other refugees their choice
of Australia has proved to be fortunate.
A Slovakian chemist, who also didn’t
want his name published, found a job
as an industrial chemist a week after
he arrived at Bonegilla; yet, again, this
was not the work of the Employment
Service. A Czech took an interest in
him, found him his first position and
then his present one with the CSIRO.
Having been the head of a research
team in Czechoslovakia, this was exactly
the sort of job he was most suited for.
Kind as he found the Australian
officials, the chemist still said they
seemed to have no experience with
qualified people, and, but for the help
of the local Czech community, he would
still be in Bonegilla receiving his $3 a
week pocket-money and feeling
extremely frustrated and annoyed about
his new country. As with Miko and the
medical couple, he had soon run out of
money in Austria, and so had to make a
choice quickly. He could have waited
in Austria for a few months until the
Australian Immigration Department
circularised Australian universities,
firms, and institutions with his quali-
fications, but the Austrian migrant
camps were not very luxurious if you
had no money.
Nor, for that matter, are the Aus-
tralian migrant centres. Although they
are reasonably comfortable, few refugees
stay a minute longer than they can
help. “It is not good for the nervous
system,” said one. Established Czechs
find “escapees” on their doorsteps every
other day. They feed them, put them
up overnight, and then find them the
jobs and accommodation the officials
seemed to overlook.
For 23-year-old Eva Jelinkova, Aus-
tralia has been great fun. She, like the
other single Czech girls, has stayed with
the families of older Czech migrants
since her arrival. Her first home was
with the Kantors. Mr. Kantor is a
partner in ar long-established Melbourne
firm of solicitors, and is one of the
trustees of a fund that the Czech
Association raised to give penniless new
arrivals some spending money. The
Immigration Department is quick to
thank the Czech Association for this,
because without this aid some of the
refugees would have gone without small
essentials and even the minimum
amount of money to travel or pay rent
in advance.
Eva, an office worker and then a
tavern maid in her hometown, found
the break with her family difficult, but
with the Russian Army stationed nearby
there was not much question about
staying. Besides, she had always wanted
to travel. In Austria she joined her
boyfriend, Michael, an architecture
student who now works as a garage
mechanic, and they flew out together.
Eva is working as a drink waitress
in a smart bistro and thinks herself
well off financially. Both for herself
and her country, the invasion has not
been all bad. “For us it is the first time
in 20 years that we are invaded, but it
has also brought us together. It is a
hard time, but also a good time for the
Czechs.” Eva had no complaints against
the Government, and thought Australia
a popular choice among the refugees.
For many of the older generation
the past few months have not been just
an adventure. Czech-born psychology
lecturer Dr. Frank Knopfelmacher sees
the situation for many of his country-
men as a repetition of Australia’s
thoughtless attitude to the 1948 refugees.
“History seems to be repeating itself —
cheap reffo labor all over again.” Dr.
Knopfelmacher sees no significant assist-
ance of any kind being given to what
he calls “a jackpot of human material.”
“There is no systematic effort to do
anything. They are probably the best
group of immigrants Australia has ever
had. They are literally an elite. The
elite of a modern technocratic society
like Germany’s or Sweden’s. We will
never get such people again. The oppor-
tunity is unique and it is being botched
utterly.” Knopfelmacher is concerned
both as a Czech and as an Australian.
He fears that too many of the present
refugees will drift away from their
professions, lose touch, and eventually
end up like some of their precursors,
as aimless, frustrated intellectuals lead-
ing frugal mental lives. “There is good-
will toward these people, but that is all.
The heart is the only organ that is
operating.” Knopfelmacher believes,
with many others, that essentially three
things are needed to rescue these
people—machinery to organise their
absorption into the workforce and to
negotiate with the country’s professional
boards about the recognition of quali-
fications, intensive language courses,
and some system of granting loans.
As an Australian, Knopfelmacher
thinks any loss of talent an inexcusable
waste, and as a Czech he is concerned
that a section of his old country’s intell-
igentsia will be dissipated in the sands
of Australian indifference.
There is no special committee and
there is no Governmental procedure
for giving loans, but the Immigration
Department’s answer to the second
contention is that after representations
were made by Czechs for intensive
English courses ’the question was inves-
tigated. The Minister, Mr. Snedden,
told the Czechs that intensive language
courses would be difficult to organise
for a few, that they were expensive,
and that apparently there was little
interest from the refugees. The Czech
reply is that short of keeping refugee
families on unemployment relief there
is no way to work and still attend a
special course. Special assistance is the
only solution.
On that note the Government and
the Czechs have reached a stalemate,
or they may have if Dr. Knopfelmacher
doesn’t put a rook into play. Approxi-
mately 1000 refugees have been coming
out each month on free passages or
under their own steam. The numbers
might decline. Dr. Knopfelmacher has
considered putting an ad in Vienna
newspapers warning refugees about the
exact position in Australia.


LADIES’ NIGHT OUT
Members of the West Pymble Ladies’ Indoor Bowling Club live it up at the Music Hall.
FOR AUSTRALIAN nightclubs and
restaurants it’s chicken-and-Rinegolde
time the season, of the all-female
party booking, “the ladies’ night out.”
It all began months ago. The first
tentative telephone calls were made,
prices and programs taken down,' the
group informed of the results, and
assiduous comparisons made with every
other similar establishment in town.
Would the Music Hall change its show
in time? Iris had seen “Her Only
Mistake,” so that was out if they
didn’t. Somebody else wanted to go to
the Doncaster they’d always liked
Ron Frazer on the “Mavis” show. But
then what about Noel Brophy at the
Bull ’n Bush? He was so funny with
Dita. There was always Les Girls—
they were certainly different, and very
funny, according to Shirley’s sister,
who’d been taken there for her birth-
day. But to go there without a inan
. . . no, perhaps not.
Price didn’t matter too much. They’d
already started putting 40 cents in each
week, and by the end of the year
there’d be plenty. It was just nice to
know you were getting the best for
it and making sure of a good time.
During December, Sydney’s main
theatre-restaurants estimate that between
60 percent and 80 percent of their
audiences are made up of all-women
groups. It may be an office, factory, or
social-club party, with as many as 80
women, or the members of a women’s
bowling club, an RSL auxiliary, a
crowd of neighbors, or old friends tak-
ing the night off from the family simply
because it’s Christmas.
Most Australian women seem
uniquely unselfconscious about going
out in the evening unescorted. Despite
the famous cosiness of English pubs,
English women are usually reluctant
to visit them without men to accom-
pany them, and European women con-
fine their outings with one another to
leisurely lunches. Tavernas in Athens,
for example, are crowded at lunchtime
with groups of well-dressed women
drinking beer with their 'meals because
it’s more expensive than wine, and, so,
more fashionable.
Australian women like to lunch
together, too. In the social departments
of many newspapers, “lunch rounds”
(a picture-taking tour of the
restaurants) is a long-established tradi-
tion, and the Chevron Hotel in Sydney
caters for 250 women a time at its
midweek fashion-parade luncheons.
But in Australia female camaraderie
carries over into the evening, so that
each Friday night places like Cahill’s
chain of Brass Rail Bistros, with a
licence to serve wine and wine-based
drinks, are full of all-girl groups who’ve
come straight from their offices. And
at the end of the year this kind of
outing is organised on a more ambitious
and more expensive scale.
The more urbane younger woman
scorns the practice with the excuse that
s he finds large numbers of those of her
own sex too boring to spend so much
time and money with. But, more truth-
fully, she’s probably just as concerned
about the manless image she’s present-
ing to the other people in the night-
club. She may not mind meeting two
or three girlfriends for drinks after
work, or having dinner with them in
an inexpensive restaurant, but large
parties of women and an air which
says the evening has been planned are
anathema to her. She’ll go to the local
cinema on a Saturday night with
another giil., but they 11 both wear
jeans as if they d suddenly decided
this was a film they had to see.
Casualness makes it acceptable.
But at Christmas even she may
succumb to the festive fever that hits
most offices, and if she manages to
excuse herself from it she’ll be part of a
minority group.
The 40-cent outlay per week absolves
everybody from any feelings of guilt
about spending so much money on her-
self in one evening—sometimes the
kitty can even be stretched to cover
taxi fares—and there is usually the
implicit agreement that a woman can
withdraw and recover her share of the
money if she needs it for something
else, perhaps holidays or forgotten
Christmas presents. But by December
the outing has taken on the significance
of a not-to-be-missed escapist ritual,
and the theatre-restaurants say they
find there are few drop-outs after the
August head-count,
The younger groups from offices and
factories will often choose a nightclub
or a restaurant with no floorshow
although it may have a dance floor’
an( j a man from another party asks
orie th em to dance she will because
it’s an occasion, and a little chivalry
from a man other than one’s husband
suits such an occasion,
“But the party never splits up,” says
one girl who has been having dinner
annually with seven other girls from
the same factory for the past five years,
“The rest of the time we talk. We talk
all day at work, too, but there always
seems to be something else to say.”

different. You can enjoy talk and a
good dinner, but if the party’s all
women, a theatre-restaurant is the best
place to go. We went to the ‘Revue at
the ’Loo’ one year had cocktails
beforehand and felt we were really liv-
ing it up.”
Sometimes “the girls’ night out”
becomes a slightly daring excursion—
with the temporary dispensation of
some inhibitions. For example, one hotel
recently received a call from a woman
who asked first if women were admitted
unescorted into the hotel’s nightclub.
On being told they were, she said deli-
cately that she and her friend were
“two single ladies over 40, and we
don’t mind if some gentlemen of the
same age join us.”
The same spirit of daring doesn’t
always operate when it comes to the
menu —one restaurant says that about
half the women in a party will order
a la carte but that poultry, despite the
fact that it’s no longer considered a
luxury in many homes, has lost none
of its popularity.
The fact that it’s served in a basket
or fried in breadcrumbs with all the
accompaniments that turn it into
Chicken Maryland seems novelty
enough. And if it’s not the choice may
be lobster, a dish which is not likely
to be served at home, or, if it’s avail-
able, Chinese food, now almost as much
a part of the Australian culinary scene
as pie and chips.
Unless the funds run to champagne,
the wine is usually sweet, white, and
sparkling—and everybody has dessert.
Perhaps it’s not sophistication, but it
is enjoyment, and, after all, what else
matters —except possibly a few new
stories to tell your husband, who has
probably told you his latest joke from
his last outing with the boys at least
three times.


Getting out the Aboriginal vote was difficult
By STAN SMITH
“YOU BIN all along vote for me,”
said one of the candidates in the recent
Legislative Council elections in the
Northern Territory. He was talking to
Aboriginal voters at a settlement, some
of the 1600 full-blood Aborigines who
voted. All but a few of them voted at
missions and settlements and all but
a few of them needed some help.
Winning the Aboriginal vote was a
serious business to the candidates. The
percentage of Aboriginal voters ranged
from 25 to 55 in five rural electorates.
Candidates used special basic English
pamphlets, speeches, interpreters, and
simple forms of visual aids. None of
them really knew an effective method
of getting through the message and
none of them really knew what the
message should be. Messages tried in-
cluded a better education for
Aborigines, kick out the foreign
capitalists, land rights, a better deal
for Aborigines, your sincere friend,
vague offers of help, and vote for a
fellow Aborigine.
This last message was used by the
two Aboriginal candidates (one of
them a part-Aboriginal woman from
N.S.W.). Neither of them won a seat.
Mrs. Clague polled only 14 percent of
the total votes and George Winunguj,
the full-blood Aboriginal carpenter,
polled a third of the primary votes in
an electorate with 55 percent
Aboriginal voters.
Voting patterns at past elections
were no guide, as Aborigines have only
voted once before in a Legislative
Council election. A new development
has arisen since the last election.
Instruction (42) was issued on Septem-
ber 10. “Instructions to Presiding
Officers,” it reads. “The nu'mber of
illiterate voters has increased con-
siderably since the extension of the
franchise to the Aboriginal people.” It
goes on to detail the ways in which
illiterate'persons can be helped to vote,
provided that the presiding officer is
satisfied, “. . . that a voter is illiterate
to a degree demanding special assis-
tance.”
Two ways are detailed. The first
gives the presiding officer the right to
read the names of the candidates on
the ballot paper from top to bottom.
He then asks the voter to nominate
his preference and marks the paper
accordingly. The second way allows the
presiding officer to mark the ballot
paper in accordance with a how-to-
vote card provided that the voter has
indicated his approval. As an extra
assistance, roman numerals were
allowed to be used, as it was found
from an earlier election that some
Aborigines had difficulty in making the
figures 2 and 3.
Stories of irregularities when
Aborigines vote are common talk in
the north. Before elections in 1965 and
the Federal elections in 1966, officials
and others were alleged to have intro-
duced favored candidates’ names at
church services, roll-calls, and school
lessons at missions, settlements, and
cattle stations.
Mr. Ross McPherson, Electoral
Officer in Darwin, said it was difficult
to get people to man the polling booths.
“We like to get people on the spot,”
he said. The people on the spot in the
recent elections were, on the 12 mission
and 12 settlement polling booths, prac-
tically all European staff members.
Twenty-three of the 24 presiding
officers were staff men, and the 24th
was a policeman at an outback polling
booth situated in the police-station
grounds. Most of the prisoners at this
station between elections are Aborigines.
Nineteen of the polling-booth clerks
Mrs. Clague . .. only 14 percent
were also European staff members.
Three of the rest were Europeans from
outside, and the balance of two were
Aborigines. Only one in five voters at
missions and settlements is a European.
When the bulk of Aboriginal voters
came to the polling booth and applied
for assistance, they were face-to-face
with either their boss, confessor, adviser,
educator, paymaster, or spiritual guide.
In some cases they were all the same
person. Aborigines living on missions
and settlements live under constant
supervision. They live under people
with normal, natural prejudices and
inhibitions, no better, no worse than
people elsewhere. They make their
opinions and feelings known on politics,
Parties, and organisations to their col-
leagues and to Aborigines. Aboriginal
advancement organisations and their
members are known to have been
criticised and even abused in front of
Aboriginal audiences.
Imagine, then, the conflict of an
Aboriginal voter who may wish to vote
for a man or a Party criticised by
authority. He faces authority at the
polling both and is obliged to ask for
assistance. Less than perfect Aborigines
might well fail and nominate the other,
“safe” candidate. What really happens
will never be known. The halting
answers, the shades of emphasis, the
significant look, perhaps a loaded
question “ are you sure you mean
Mr. So-and-So?”, a how-to-vote card
dropped and all the business done in
that slightly exasperated condescending
manner that Europeans use with
Aborigines.
One complaint has been made since
this last election. At another booth a
presiding officer is known to have made
a vote formal by completing it and not
being absolutely sure of the voter’s
second and third preferences. “It very
nearly finished as a cross-examination,”
he said. “The polling booth was begin-
ning to fill up. The selection of the
candidates was almost a public issue as
the voter’s mates joined in the discus-
sion. I had to finalise it somehow.” He
sighed. “Thereafter if no immediate
selection of preferences was made I
left the primary selection in its little
box, alone like an English ballot paper.”
Informal votes in the two electorates
with substantial numbers of Aboriginal
voters were greater than in European
majority electorates. This situation is
better perhaps than at the three polling
booths of Hermansburg, Papunya, and
Aryonga in the 1965 elections. The
column for informal votes showed Nil
when the returns came from this
mission and two settlements. Even the
cynics were speechless.
The importance of Aborigines as
equal citizens and responsible voters was
clearly shown when the manager of a
large cattle station opened an envelope
addressed to an Aboriginal voter. This
was done just before the last election
in front of a candidate. “I want to find
out what I’m supposed to do with a
native’s postal voting form,” he said.
Aborigines as voters in the Northern
Territory is a subject of lively interest.
Aborigines voted at a much lower rate
to registrations than Europeans,
although a lot of Aborigines had a pas-
sionate, pilgrim-like attitude to the duty
of voting. Registrations to total adult
population is only 20 percent, not much
higher now than in 1965.
By the time of the next elections
Aborigines will not even have an
electorate with an Aboriginal majority.
Arnhem, the only one now, will have
4000 more Europeans by 1971. Many
Aborigines did not vote for George
Winunguj, the Aboriginal candidate for
Arnhem at the last election, because
they didn’t know him or they thought
he couldn’t compete successfully with
European candidates. It will be a long
time before Europeans vote in any
appreciable strength for Aborigines in
the north, even if the candidate is as
good as, or even better than, his
European opposition.


Solving the problem that
didn’t exist
By CAROLYN SYMES
ONE OF OUR commonest easy
assumptions about the non-English-
speaking immigrants we have induced
to come here has been that the children
pick up English in the playground, so
that receiving their education in a
language other than their own is no
real problem at all. Now, one full
generation after large-scale immigration
began, that assumption has to be dis-
carded and the cost of it, both to
immigrant children and to Australia,
estimated.
Some of the damage is now being
repaired, at least for children cur-
rently at school. But what compensa-
tion can be made to those who dropped
out early because they could not cope
with the level of English required be-
yond a year or two into secondary
school?
The method of tackling this prob-
lem has taken classic form. Those
States with large numbers of immi-
grants gradually moved toward solu-
tions. Only now did it slowly dawn
on the Commonwealth Government,
which brought the immigrants here
and left it to the States to educate
their children, that education in English
is necessary for immigrant children. The
Immigration Department and the Com-
monwealth Department of Education,
with the N.S.W. Education Depart-
ment’s division of research and plan-
ning, have begun a survey of the prob-
lem no one thought was there to find
out whether the methods chosen by
those who have had close, personal
contact with the children are the best.
The survey will try to find out the
number of immigrant children in need
of special attention. It will also try
to establish whether it is better in
general to offer the children special
help in their normal class or establish
separate classes for English lessons.
Although it is not known how many
children need special help in English,
immigrant children are statistical
clusters in the cities, generally either
in the older inner suburbs or the semi-
rural outer ones, and in industrial
towns.
Victoria’s “English Another
Language” is claimed to be the first
special course introduced in Australia
to overcome the immigrant child’s
language difficulty. Initially in Victoria
about 50 special teachers were selected
for training and went out in the field.
About 80 have now attended special
intensive training courses and a team of
teachers visits schools to give in-service
training. At last count, 153 schools were
using the course in Victoria seven
independent schools, 88 primary, 36 high
schools, and 22 technical colleges—and
the course and help are available to any
school on request.

inspector who seems to have been the
first person to tackle the problem in
a comprehensive fashion in that State
is Miss Olive Nichols, whose inspector-
ate is Redfern, taking in much of the
inner Sydney area. She experimented
with methods which she researched in
England and the United States and
has gradually acquired a small group of
special teachers to boost the effort in
the schools in her area.
Now this isolated work, which Miss
Nichols regards as a labor of love, may
have grown by what she calls “peaceful
penetration” into the N.S.W. Education
Department’s solution to the problem.
By early next year, the Government
Printer will have published an initial
10,000 copies of a new textbook, called
“English for Us” (Book 1), which will
be available to every child needing an
introduction to and special instruction
in English. A second volume is in the
planning stage.
“English for Us” is an extension of
two earlier books compiled and roneoed
within the schools of the Redfern
Inspectorate since 1964. When copies of
the first, “English for Migrant Chil-
dren,” were soon depleted, a second,
more ambitious effort, “English for New-
comers,” came into being. It was based
like the first, on the aural-oral-visual
method of teaching, but progressed to
past tenses and included reading matter
about Australia designed to develop the
children’s ideas about their new country.
It was sought by teachers through the
State and from other States, who were
faced with difficulties in teaching
immigrant children. The course
emphasises student participation. Each
child in New South Wales will be sup-
plied with a book, and after initial
teaching can continue working alone.
The N.S.W. Education Department
has now allocated nine “migrant
teachers” to teach only English to
immigrant children in the Redfern area
and three to the neighboring inspec-
torate of Marrickville. Groups of ten
children at various stages of progress
- non-speakers, non-readers, and non-
writers are given one or two special
lessons each day away from their
normal classes, to which they then
return with a little more understanding
and confidence.
The basis of the controlled method
used is to teach the children to listen
to the new language, to use sounds
which do not occur in their native
tongue, to understand, speak, and
imitate, then to read and write. Three
schools working on the program also
use mini-labs, sets of earphones through
which the children listen to tape-
recorded lessons which they repeat in
response and which the teacher can
monitor. These concentrated lessons
are made as enjoyable as possible by,
for example, learning and singing
songs which are acted out with
puppets.
However, it is clear that things go
more easily for younger children.
Pupils over the age of ten who arrive
here speaking only their native
language and who cannot be graded
more than one class below their age
group are generally selfconscious,
slower to learn, and have more
difficulty in contributing to classroom
activities before they move on to high
school. For this reason, one “migrant
teacher” travels around the high
schools of the inner Sydney area giv-
ing special classes to these older
children. The proposed second book
of “English for Us” will be more
specifically directed toward secondary-
school pupils.
But, as Miss Nichols points out, for-
mal classes don’t give all the answers.
In the classroom and playground there
must be a steady build-up of social
contact. She advocates organised
cultural exchanges such as national-
costume parades and displays of danc-
ing.
“Even the shyest immigrant parents
can be persuaded to come to the school
for this sort of thing,” she said. “These
occasions are the means of breaking
down barriers which come from mis-
understandings.” One of the most
common, according to Miss Nichols, is
the parents’ feeling that the schools
are trying to take away their
children’s national language and tra-
ditions.


These barrels hold the reasons
why Mildara Three Star Brandy
will taste the same this year,
next year, even ten years hence.
Fine Brandy is the sum of many different factors. The quality of
the original grapes. The skill of the distiller. The type of still.
The cask oak. The time of ageing. And, above all, the skill
of the blender. He subtly blends brandies of varying
ages to produce a consistent style which will not
change from year to year. Barrel One for example,
was laid down in 1936. Barrel Two in 1944,
Barrel Three, 1950, Barrel Four,
1961, Barrel Five, 1963 and Barrel
Six, 1966, the youngest spirit
allowed by Excise. There are many
other brandies of differing years
which, with the Blender’s art,
produce Mildara Three Star
Brandy. Consistently good, no
matter when you buy it.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
And now —the new, all practical,
supraground movie industry
Filming Bruce
McNaughton’s “Far
Off World” in
Melbourne ...
“Before we start the
trick stuff we should
learn how to make
straight films”
By RICHARD CAMPBELL
THE POSTER reads, “A colorful
evening in glorious black-and-white
(and color), new independent Aus-
tralian films (above ground).” This
really shouldn’t sound original, but it
almost does. It is the proclamation of
a program of ten short films which
have all been made locally by locals
for a wider audience than the nation’s
dedicated film buffs. Most of these
films are, to use a word that sticks in
the throat, like a ’couta bone, poten-
tially commercial.
Brought together by the energy of
Melbourne film producer Bruce Mc-
Naughton under the jaunty but unspe-
cific rubric of “new independent Aus-
tralian films,” they were shown at the
Palais in Melbourne the other Sunday
and may go interstate if the organisers
feel confident of good audiences.
As films, they have little in common
except that they are not of the sub-
terranean breed. What distinguishes
underground from aboveground is
hard to say. One test is whether the
makers want to be known as troglo-
dytes or not. “We want to divorce our-
selves from that image,” said Mc-
Naughton in, his South Melbourne
office last week.
Rejecting the psychedelic gimmickry
of the underground, McNaughton hopes
the venture will help local producers
with the one undeniable incentive:
cash. With no entrepreneur taking his
cut, each film shown will be paid part
of the gate in proportion to the length
of the film. After the rent of the
cinema is paid, this should give some
return to people who would otherwise
have spent hundreds, even thousands,
of dollars without much likelihood of
a commercial screening. If the pro-
gram is taken interstate they hope most
of the films might, with luck, eventu-
ally break even,.
McNaughton is sure that most of
the films on the program could be
commercial propositions. “People
would love them if they could see
them. ‘Once Upon A Twilight,’ a pilot
film made around the frivolous cavort-
in,gs of the Twilight pop group and
pop singer Robbie Burns, is world
class for its type. It is made for a
teenage audience, and they would lap
it up. It has flaws, but all of these sort
of films do.”
As the outlets for film stand at the
moment, McNaughton said, “the mar-
ket is almost nil.” There was the ABC
and the State Film Libraries, but they
would rarely pay enough to cover even
part of the cost. It was some help even
if they did buy it well below cost, but
such a sale cruelled any chance of
selling the short to the film distributors.
At the moment, if the cin.ema chains
did take a short, they would, in his
experience, not pay enough to cover
the cost of damage to the print. Then
there was the cost of converting 16mm.
films to the 35mm. used by the cinema
chains. Who would bear the cost?
The cinema chains do, in fact, profess
to be sympathetic, but there is a strict
limit on sympathy: commercial success.
Columbia’s John Allen said, “We wish
the local industry every success, but
these films must be commercially
acceptable. One of our problems is
getting people to come to us. We are
always open to negotiation, because we
have instructions to keep our eyes and
ears open for local material.”
Many of the “new independent Aus-
tralian films” are at least one step
toward commercial acceptability: they
are conceived simply. “The key to most
things is simplicity,” said McNaughton,
who has spent eight years in the
industry, winning a few awards, pro-
ducing commercials, television docu-
mentaries (he worked as a photographer
on four of the “Project’66” series), and
making his own short films. “If you
start getting complicated you are
eventually going to mess yourself up.”
He and his commercial film partner,
Dennis Meltzer, believe that it will be
this approach which will do most to
lift the local industry to its feet. “Before
we start the trick stuff and the special
effects we should learn how to make
straight films. Let’s face it—cinema is
basically storytelling on film. It has to
communicate more than special effects.”
His own films, “Five Days” and “Far
Off World,” follow this injunction as
do films such as John Alaimo’s “And
It Was Called Joadja,” a documentary
about a long-dead town in New South
Wales, which is told forcibly, directly,
and with moments of beauty,
Being not particularly impressed by
sort of minority vogue films shot
while half the crew was high on drugs
or in alcoholic stupors, McNaughton
and the other producer-directors have
no qualms abo£t “going commercial.”
“We hope we will create a market for
the guys who want to say something
and are game enough to do it.”
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
MAN AS A SYMBOL
The p ox> Director, Mark Rydell.

WITH MOST of the theatres showing
movies designed as holiday treats for
the children, it is nice to find that the
Christmas season will provide at least
one film aimed at grown-up audiences,
“The Fox” isn’t an entirely satisfactory
screen adaptation of D. H. Lawrence’s


novella, but it has a welcome tang of
astringency to offset all that sweetness.
The story is a simple one. Two girls
are trying to run a moribund chicken
farm (it’s been moved to Canada, pre-
sumably to account for Sandy Dennis’
accent). The farm never quite pays its
way, and matters are being made worse
by the depredations of a fox. March,
the apparently stronger character of the
two she has adopted the role of
“man of the house” while Jill cooks
and fusses over the accounts -- hunts
it through the snowy woods. But when
she and the fox meet and it faces her
with an unafraid, enigmatic stare, she
Anne Heywood as March, with Keir
Dullea in a scene from “The Fox”
is too fascinated by its' confidence, its
independence, its maleness to kill it.
She begins now to feel the frustration
in her own life.
Into the girls’ cosy, enclosed life
comes Paul, a sailor who had spent his
childhood on the farm and who offers
to work for them during his leave. Jill
at first welcomes him, even flirts with
him in a spinsterish way, but this
attitude turns to implacable hatred
when she finds that he has proposed to
March. March, torn between two loyal-
ties, trying to please everybody, ends
by precipitating tragedy.
The amount of actual incident in the
story is small; the interest in Law-
rence’s original is in his analysis of the
motivations, often, unrecognised by
themselves, of the three characters.
Since this is easier to do with the
written word than in a film (except
through the actions of the characters),
one is left at the end of “The Fox”
feeling that everything has been spread
too thin; the actual plot could have
been told in about a third of the
running time, and the director has had
to fill in the rest with irrelevant conver-
sations, the creation of atmosphere, and
a far too dreamy and sentimental
musical score by Lalo Schifrin.
But there is much to admire in the
film: visually it is very striking, with
a wonderful feeling for the look, the
feel, the sheer space of the winter-
bound countryside; and the soundtrack,
when Mr. Schifrin can be persuaded
to shut up, is remarkably evocative.
The potentially sensational sequences
are handled with great control the
scene in which Ellen/March, naked
after a bath, caresses her own body
and acknowledges to herself her
femalen,ess, or the scene of reconcilia-
tion between the girls, in which the
latent homosexuality of their relation-
ship (barely implied by Lawrence) is
stated specifically but with remarkable
tact.
Anne Heywood gives an attractively
un-histrionic performance, though she
is perhaps rather too mature and
sophisticated to convince completely as
the bewildered Ellen/March, as much
a victim of the fox and all it stands
for as any of the chickens. Sandy.
Dennis begins with all her mannerisms
at their most infuriating, but as is
often the case with this odd, inconsis-
tent player gains more control as an.
actress as the character she’s playing
loses hers. Keir Dullea conveys splen-
didly the independent, feral quality of
Paul, and cannot be blamed for not
making the character recognisably real:
one of the major faults in the screen,
adaptation is that the man is treated
as an enigmatic symbol rather than
as an individual.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
ARTHUR'S TAKEOVER
An Enemy of the People. Ibsen.
Ensemble Theatre, Sydney.
HAYES GORDON has, no doubt,
chosen Arthur Miller’s adaptation of
this play for its strident theatrical
effects and simplification for contem-
porary appeal. Written in 1950, shortly
before the polemical fury of “The
Crucible,” this version of Ibsen has a
sense of personal outrage. Miller finds
the dilemma of Dr. Stock'mann remark-
ably like his own: that of “the life-long
democrat who learns, from the example
of his own country, that majority rule
is not infallible” (Tynan). This theme
is developed from a simple (and true)
incident about a medical officer who
finds that the health springs on which
his town’s prosperity is based are
poisoned a decision to reveal the
situation will ruin the town and his
own career.
The most significant changes from
Ibsen’s treatment occur in Act 11, Sc. 2
(Ibsen’s Act IV), in which the doctor
calls a public ’meeting to expose the
state of the springs. Ibsen’s crowd,
who are without preconceptions and
of varying shades of opinion and status,
and whom Stockmann progressively
alienates by comparing them to
mongrels and declaring their town “a
quagmire of lies and fra*ud,” are
realistically observed and the doctor’s
passionate attack is treated with some
measure of irony and objectivity the
popular vote that he is “a public
enemy” is shown to arise logically
from the situation and the doctor’s
reaction to it.
In Miller’s version, the rabble who
burst in are already predisposed against
Stockmann, and he is represented as a
betrayed crusader against whom forces
are progressively stacked. His
realisation that the majority are always
wrong is a bitterly personal one so
that one hears Miller’s own voice where
Ibsen’s never sounded - and the
speech of the embattled individual is
drowned by a triumphant tribal chant
of “en-e-my, en-e-my, en-e-my . .
Ibsen’s own reaction ,in 1822 to the
outcry over “Ghosts” resulted in a
play written in anger and in half the
time that he normally took. It concen-
trates on ideas and the accumulation of
incidents to illustrate them. Miller’s
version and this production both
exaggerate this tendency, with the
result that the initially exciting and
thought-provoking situation of Act I
only gives rise to developments that
seem predictable and repetitive, while
Stockmann’s final decision to remain
in the town seems 'more like banner-
waving by the author than a brave
stand for truth by the character.
Don Reid’s performance as Stock-
mann has a great deal of conviction and
sometimes manages to lighten the
heroism of the character with more
hints of his uncontrolled enthusiasm
and rivalry with his brother than Miller
seems to consider necessary. Peter
Wagner, equipped with a cane whose
clenched-fist ~ handle symbolises his
authority, as mayor, over his brother,
exemplifies all' the vigorous two-
dimensionality of the production,
becoming nearly as much a symbol of
power as his own cane. Michael Brooke,
well cast in voice and appearance as
Aslaksen the pusillanimous printer,
probably achieves the most believable
characterisation l in relation to the
requirements of the Ensemble stage.
If one comes away admiring the
sentiments rather than thinking about
them, and impressed by the emotional
impact rather than the artistic achieve-
ment, probably neither adapter nor
director will be unduly disappointed—
they have both, after all, opted for 1
polemics.

Jazz—and it’s uniquely Australian
By TOM PICKERING
PERHAPS one reason why even the
best Australian jazzmen are unable to
earn a living playing jazz is the lack
of interest in airing and recording their
product. Three recent LPs, featuring
the cream of Melbourne jazz talent on
Nevill Sherburn’s non-commercial
Swaggie label, produce a spark of
hope for the future: two by Len
Barnard’s Famous Jazz Band and one
by Roger Bell’s Pagan Pipers.
Seven years ago Barnard was respon-
sible for an, album called “The Naked
Dance,” which was deservedly hailed
as the most consistently exciting jazz
to have been recorded in Australia.
Two years later Bell came up with
“The Wombat,” and this has remained
its only rival. These still stand out as
oases in the desert of traditional-
based Australian recorded jazz.
The earlier records were notable for
the unhackneyed material and the
enthusiasm of the performances. The
same may be said of the recent sessions
and there is an extra sureness of
technique and greater definition of the
musical personalities concerned. In his
unusually felicitious sleeve-notes for
“The Mountebank,” Len Barnard says,
“The gentlemen of the orchestra are
devotees of the backward glance.” This
is true enough and yet the music is not
merely nostalgic; it is tijueless, inven-
tive jazz which borrows freely from
the entire jazz heritage, regardless of
period or style. The resulting amalgam
is strongly individual and possesses a
decided accent which, regardless of
derivation, one can call Australian if
only because nothing quite like it
exists anywhere else.
Apart from the leader, whose
thought and taste govern every track
of “Hot Tuesday” and “The Mounte-
bank,” the dominant musical presence
is his brother, Bob. This is partly
because of the leading trumpet role
but largely due to his phenomenal
execution and tone, which are
unequalled in this country and, indeed,
compare favorably with any trumpeter
in the world. Having said as much, can
one criticise him because his style is
cast so firmly in the Armstrong mould?
Even though his performances in
daring, stamina, and melodic inven-
tion sometimes rival the master in
his declining years, one feels that the
ultimate greatness which should be
Bob’s, given his talent, may elude him
unless he discards the more obvious
Armstrong stylistic devices. Listening
to tracks like “That Rhythm Man” and
“I Hate to Leave You Now,” however,
one can only marvel and suspend
judgment regardless of progenitorship.
As always, Ade Monsbrough comes
on surging and roaring with complete
authenticity no matter what instru-
ment he chooses to blow. The tenor
sax has become the latest Mons-
brough “voice” and this is his first
extensive recorded exposure on this
horn. He has not yet developed the
unique character on ten,or that he has
on alto, but there is still the same
authority and uncanny feeling for the
right note at the right time. The Mons-
brough alto sound will never disappear
while Neville Stribling continues to
desert his sheep for music. While he
does not create as much rhythmic
suspense as Ade, he carries on the
Monsbrough tradition with tremendous
verve and a fresh quality all his own.
The clarinet-playing of Fred Parkes
is as accomplished and engagingly
eccentric as ever, although, on several
tunes, he does not display quite the
sensitivity to the prevailing mood as on
the earlier “Naked Dance.” Throughout
both albums a versatile rhythm team
switches instruments to fit tunes as
diverse as the thoughtful “No Regrets”
and the rip-roaring “Moten Stomp.”
Few pianists could so successfully
embrace such a wide range of styles as
does Graham Coyle, and Len Barnard
proves repeatedly that he is Australia’s
finest drummer, contributing color as
well as propulsion. I thought that the
jazz-band vocalist, as distinct from the
featured singer, was, like the dodo, an
extinct bird. Barnard has discovered
one in Beverley Hay, and she sings,
with rare jazz feeling, four songs at
each session.
As five of the Barnard band (Mons-
brough, Stribling, Peter Cleaver, Mai
Wilkinson, and Len Barnard) are also
on the Roger Bell record, it is not
surprising to find a similarity of style
and spirit. The different flavor is furn-
ished by Roger Bell’s jaunty trumpet
and Rex Green’s piano. While neither
possesses the same degree of technical
brilliance as his counterpart on the
Barnard discs, the thoroughly individual
sound of each on his instrument more
than compensates for this.
Bell’s recording consists entirely of
his own originals, a praiseworthy “first”
in Australian jazz history. With their
occasional echoes of Ragtime and Music
Hall, one can scarcely avoid describing
these 13 wonderful tunes as nostalgic,
but this does not detract from their
melodic and harmonic interest, their
jazzworthiness and extraordinary
variety. In short, the soul of “The
Badger” has been captured. Roger’s
well-known proclivity for oddly apt
titles is again in evidence. “Roar Like
a Prawn” and “The Bobby Dazzler”
serve as examples. There is a danger
of monotony in recording so much of
one composer’s music together, but this
is avoided by imaginative arrangements
and the varying approaches of the
soloists.
So much deserves comment: Stribling’s
inspired clarinet throughout, freely
improvising on unfamiliar material;
Mai Wilkinson’s brief bursts of fine
trombone; Ade’s alto sound re-estab-
lished; Bud Baker’s rarely heard guitar
solos; Peter Cleaver’s and Lou Silbe-
reisen’s impeccable backing; the leaping
ensembles.
Having, I hope, made it clear that
these musicians are producing world-
class jazz, it remains only to question
why not even one band of this type can
find regular full-time employment. Of
these 13 musicians, only the Barnard
brothers are professionals, and neither
gets much opportunity to exercise his
jazz talent. The rest —and this applies
to jazzmen all over the country —are
lucky if they manage one casual engage-
ment a week. Creative, technically com-
petent jazz like this should be subsidised
in some way if commercial opportunity
does not exist. Would each capital city
have a symphony orchestra if it were
not for the ABC? Surely Melbourne
and Sydney could support eight-piece
jazz bands on a similar basis.
Soprano Kiang Hwa - soloist in this
year’s “Messiah” reviewed below
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
THIS YEAR —OPULENCE
A REVIEW of the Australian Broad-
casting Commission’s annual perform-
ance of “Messiah” is always inclined
to be in the nature of an obituary
despite the robust condition of the
corpse. Disregarding all the scholar-
ship of the past 20 years we still get
a fine old Victorian four-square
reading; none of this double-dotting
or decoration, but as it was presented
in an age when we knew where we
were and were equally sure of where
we were going.
Sir Bernard Heinze, who conducted
the performance, is obviously convinced
that Handel’s masterpiece makes its
greatest impact when given the opulent
treatment; as a consequence, few
players in the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra had the night off. Instru-
ments whose presence would have
startled the composer gave tongue, and
at times the sound from the orchestra
was almost cloying and a singular
negation of 18th-century style.
The performance marked the last


appearance of the Hurlstone Choir under
its old name, which has been an anach-
ronism for some time; indeed, the choir
would be hard put to summon up one
member who lived in the Hurlstone
area. In the new year it will be known
as the Philharmonia Choir, and on its
“Messiah” performance it need have
little fear that invidious comparisons
will be made with its famous namesake
in Britain. Their singing was clean,
their intonation was exemplary, and not
even the almost-unrelieved forte
demanded by Sir Bernard could hide the
stylish phrasing and the uniformly excel-
lent breath-control of this stalwart group.
Unlike most choirs, their tenor line is
very strong, and if any weakness exists
it is in the sopranos, and this is a weak-
ness of quantity, not quality.
It was significant that the only chorus
with almost Beethovian dynamics, “His
Yoke Is Easy,” was omitted. This chorus
is the most difficult balancing job in
the whole work, and treated to a full-
throated performance it can become a
tonal shambles, so its absence could well
have been fortuitous. The prevailing
heartiness of the accompanied choral
work spilt over into the only a capella
sections, “Since by Man Came Death”
and “For as in Adam All Die.” These
moments can be magical, and the Hurl-
stones are capable of a superb pianis-
simo, but again the sound never went
below a mezzo piano, with the result
that the golden thunder of the Resurrec-
tion choruses which followed did not
have the dramatic impact that Handel
undoubtedly intended.
The soloists were first-class, with
Robert Gard, predictably, after his
virtuoso handling of Britten’s trickly
melisma in “The Turn of the Screw,”
making child’s play of Handel’s most
florid stretches. Equally satisfying was
the work of Lauris Elms and Noel
Melvin; and proceedings were further
enlivened by a few attempts on Miss
Elms’ part to sneak some decorations
past Sir Bernard. As always with Miss
Elms, “He Was Despised” was a most
moving experience. Quite a lot of the
interest in this performance centred
on the soprano Kiang Hwa, from
Hong Kong, who had previously sung
the title role of “Madame Butterfly” in
the ABC’s successful television produc-
tion. She sang beautifully with possibly
overmuch brightness at times, her per-
formance falling between a womanly
approach a la Schwarzkopf and the
childlike purity of a Jennifer Vyvyan.
A really worthwhile tradition seems
to be under way\ in the Leonine Con-
sorts’ Christmas recital at the Great
Hall of Sydney University on Decem-
ber 18. Last year’s Christmas concert
was a tremendous success, and there is
no reason why this success should not
be repeated this year with a program
which includes works by Perotin,
Schutz, Victoria, and medieval carols
and chansons. This is one of the few
“in” activities which should commend
itself to most age groups during the
festive season.

GIVING IT AWAY
“FREE POETRY” is a new Sydney
magazine which, as its name suggests, is
given away rather than sold. Edited in
rotation by Nigel Roberts, John Goodall,
and Terry Gillmore, the six-page
broadsheet contains a mixture of poetry,
prose, collage, and concrete poetry.
Copies are given away in Sydney book-
shops and distributed interstate by the
editors of other small magazines. So far
two issues have appeared and, although
no charge is made for the magazine,
anyone interested enough in its survival
is requested to send $1 to assist in
publication; the second issue was partly
financed by these gifts. With a present-
print run of 500 copies, “Free Poetry”
could reach many young people whg
are unable to afford the high prices
most poetry magazines are forced to
charge.
HITLER, PLUS HARD SELL
THE SHOWING of “Mein Kampf,” a
two-hour on the rise and
fall of Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich
was given a Brechtian presentation of
ironic and bitter force on Sydney’s
Channel 10 last week. The very enor-
mity of the story, which traces the
slaughter of 28,000,000 people, has an
overwhelming nightmare quality of
unreality made even more unbelievable
by the passing of 30 years and the
separation of 12,000 miles. But with the
addition of television commercials a
new and horrifying immediacy was
achieved. The piles of skeletons lit-
tering the streets of the Warsaw ghetto
vanished to reveal a gourmandiser
making hay at a smorgasbord table and
extolling the virtues of an anti-dispeptic;
piles of hair cropped from the victims
of the concentration camps for the
German war effort were juxtaposed with
the latest offering in wiglets; an all-
purpose drilling kit, the perfect Christ-
mas present, was soon joined by the
mountains of teeth from which the gold
fillings had already been removed;
svelte young users of slimming pills
rubbed shoulders with the queues of
ugly naked humanity shuffling into the
fatal shower-baths of the gas chambers.
The mindless excesses of one society
were bitterly sandwiched between those
of another. “Mein Kampf” tells a story
which should never be forgotten. With
such skilful retelling, perhaps it never
shall be.
HAND-OUT TIME
WITH ONLY $1.5 million to hand out
during its first year of life, the
Australian Council for the Arts was not
expected to ignite the nation’s cultural
life with one flourish of its cheque
book, and when it came to hand-out
time last week it was not surprising to
Jearn that there was just enough to
meet inherited commitments and to
initiate a few modest special projects.
Major beneficiaries were the Australian
Ballet ($253,000), the Australian Opera
($193,000) and the Elizabethan Trust
($227,000 for administrative and
entrepreneurial activities). Drama did
slightly better than expected, with
Sydney’s Old Tote company scoring
$49,000 (and a further $34,000 toward
interstate tours), and the Melbourne
Theatre Company getting $70,000.
The grants won’t have satisfied
artistic endeavors on the fringe, but
the Council has wisely and as urged
by The Bulletin the other week
decided to concentrate its budget and
not spread it thinly over a -wide area
in its early life. Eventually, Federal and
State finance for the arts will need to
be much more closely co-ordinated so
that Commonwealth money is princi-
pally spent on expansive national
endeavors and the regions are mainly
looked after by the States.
The Council has given token sup-
port to music with a total $27,000 for
overseas tours by Australian groups,
and allocated $lO,OOO to encourage
Aboriginal activities in the performing
arts, a project in which Stefan Haag is
likely to be closely involved next year.
Film-makers got nothing from the first
hand-out. They will have to wait for
the Council’s next Budget, which is
expected to contain substantial assist-
ance, if only for television films. Mean-
while, there seems no barrier to film-
makers applying for a share of the
$160,000 which the Council has set
aside for “special projects.”
As the Council for the Arts is still
in the process of riding its boundaries
and as its 1968-69 budget is only
$400,000 more than the Commonwealth
gave to the performing arts last year,
it is probably unfair to expect instant
dynamism and reasonable to treat the
first hand-out patiently. But the
quicker the Council can encourage
autonomy among its principal benefici-
aries, the quicker the bulk of its grants
will stop flowing through the middle-
men at the Elizabethan Trust - and a
lot of that $227,000 can be spent to
better effect.
OUT OF THE HAT
REPORTS LAST week that the
Channel 7 television network had
decided not to buy any of the new
season’s American programs drew
attention to a little-publicised aspect
of TV administration at the executive
level the practice of balloting for
the opportunity to buy overseas
products.
Until two years ago it was every
man for himself a scramble that
resulted in inflated prices, since
Australia has four main networks in
comparison with Britain’s two and the

United States’ three. Programs were
in heavy demand and bidding was
accordingly frenetic. The networks
finally decided to rationalise the
situation when prices tripled in one
year; the Sydney and Melbourne com-
mercial stations formed a TV programs
committee with the ABC as a consenting
party.
Now, representatives from each net-
work meet annually in the Sydney
office of the Federation of Australian
Commercial Television Stations to
draw next year’s programs out a hat
literally. As each program comes up
for decision, four numbered pieces of
paper representing each network go
into the hat. If the winning network
decides it doesn’t want the program'
in question, the papers go back into the
hat and the program is up for re-
allocation. The actual ballot, which
probably takes about 30 minutes, is
supervised by an independent solicitor.
If the Channel 7 network reconsiders
its decision not to participate in this
year’s ballot and requests another one,
the other network representatives will
vote on it.
ELVES IN THE SUBURBS
ELF HORNS and the soft vowels of
the Elfish tongue floated over near-
Sydney bushland last week as the glades
of Lothlorien came to West Lindfield.
“An Evening in Middle Earth” perform-
ance was possibly the first manifestation
in Australia of the very “in” Tolkien
cult.
J. R. R. Tolkien the English philolo-
gist wrote the fantasy l ‘Lord of the
Rings,” an epic quest by Hobbits, Elves,
Dwarfs, and others in Middle Earth,
which is a realm of reality to all who
have journeyed through his pages. Pro-
ducer Chris McGill and one-time
science-fiction editor John Baxter
masterfully condensed the panorama of
three huge volumes to present a one-
hour performance which preserved both
the fascination and the language of the
original.
Players from Sydney’s Sebastians read
the extracts, underscored by original
woodwind arrangements, to a predomin-
antly bearded audience in a natural
bush amphitheatre behind McGill’s
home. The pity is that, after all the
work and excellence, “An Evening in
Middle Earth” had only two perform-
ances all too few for Hobbit com-
panions, Elf friends, and other devotees.
“I like to think,” said McGill afterward,
“that this sort of thing came and went,
sort of like a rustle in the wind.”
Tolkien people are like that.

Sogeri.
An exciting development in education
In 1969 a single high school in Papua and New Guinea will
introduce for the first time a special Territory-oriented Form 5 and Form 6 curriculum.
The school will be Sogeri High, near Port Moresby.
We are looking for some first rate teachers who are deeply involved in teaching as a craft as
well as a profession, to take the seed of this vital project and give it life.
Our aim is to develop a Territory curriculum
suited to the rapidly changing needs of Papua and New Guinea.
This won’t be an easy job ahd it isn’t a job for half-hearted teachers. But
for teachers who are looking for a chance to apply new techniques or well-thought-out
ideas in a fresh and evolving situation, Sogeri could mean fulfilment.
If you feel the pull of this challenge strongly enough to join us early in 1969, see if you fit
one of these positions.

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Striking advantageous
bargains with
overseas capital
Satisfying Mr.
Gorton: the Prime
Minister gets a
briefing on Gove’s
communal
facilities plan from
David Griffin ,
Nabalco’s chair-
man
LET US ALL DISMOUNT from our
high horses for a moment to recognise
the Swiss-Australian alumina project at
Gove for what it is. Between the
chauvinists intent on seeing some
foreign Machiavelli under every board-
room table and the self-styled “free-
traders” who would sell their grand-
mother, let alone the farm, for a quick
profit there is a broad middle-way of
reasonable attitudes toward foreign
investment of which the new arrange-
ments at Gove is one of the best reflec-
tions yet.
And the point about Gove is not that
what was to be an Australian stake of
50 percent has been reduced to 30
percent —a pointlessly mathematical
way of looking at it—but rather that an
arrangement has been reached which
satisfies the overseas interest, the Aus-
tralian commercial interest, the Aus-
tralian national interest, and Mr.
Gorton.
The $3OO million bauxite-alumina
project will be managed, significantly,
on a 50-50 basis through Nabalco, a
company formed by Swiss Aluminium
and Gove Alumina, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the CSR. The Swiss-
Australian partners will put up the
capital for the project as two individual
companies on a 70-30 basis and will
carry off their share of the alumina
produced accordingly. Nevertheless,
the new agreement includes particular
advantages for the national and local
commercial interests.
Of the $3OO million required, only
some $165 million will be needed for
the alumina treatment plant; the enor-
mous costs of setting up roads, houses,
and other communal facilities in this
wildly difficult area of the undeveloped
north will put pay to most of the
remaining $135 million. As a further
advantage, the local company may
take two million tons of bauxite a year
for export, quite separate from the
three million tons a year of bauxite
which will feed the alumina plant.
There is flexibility in the agreement.
For a start, the local company will
make use of the marketing outlets of
the Swiss and sell its share of the
alumina production to the overseas com-
pany. But should the local company
care to make its own marketing agree-
ments in future, it is at liberty to do
so. Either party may also expand the
alumina facilities whenever they so
choose, but the other party must be
given the option of a 50 percent stake
in any such expansion.
Impeachable though the agreement
seems, the Government Opposition was
none the less game to have a go and
attack along the lines that the 50-50
project as originally envisaged was
worth more to Australia than the
30 percent stake in the new and
expanded plan: “The greater the sue-
cess the smaller Australia’s share in it.”
Neither point holds water. Compar-
ing the old plan with the new, by
increasing the Australian investment
from $5O million to $93 million the
export effort will receive a hearty boost
from an output of alumina doubled to
a million tons a year, plus two million
tons a year of bauxite. The Australian
commercial interest has an extra 50,000
tons a year of alumina, raising its total
share to 300,000 tons, and the bauxite
concession to feel happy about, quite
apart from the liberal arrangements for
independent growth.
The original plan was too small to
be a success, anyhow. Profit margins on
alumina production are low compared
with the massive capital outlay
required. On the originally proposed
alumina output of 500,000 tons a year,
capital employed by the local company
seemed liable to yield far less than the
7.5 percent expected of it. Unlike its
Swiss partner, there was not the far
more profitable business of smelting the
alumina into aluminium to be taken
into account.
Without overseas interest, Gove
would never have found itself on the
map. The bauxite deposits there were
discovered in a joint venture between
the Australian Government and British
Aluminium, passed into American
hands when Reynolds Metals took over
British Aluminium, and sold out to
Alcan of Canada before being taken up
by Swiss Aluminium and the CSR.
There, the technological knowhow and
marketing capacity of the overseas com-
pany plus the local knowledge of the
Australian partner leavened with
co-operation on both sides have come up
with a satisfactory plan to establish
one of the major alumina centres in
the world and what could turn out to
be the largest single project to be
undertaken by private enterprise in
Australia.
Of course, overseas capital and know-
how is needed to develop Australia, but
there are some pretty advantageous
bargains which can be struck with it.
COTTON
JAPAN AND THE ORD
EVEN IF THE delegation from the
Japanese Cotton-spinners’ Association
are enthusiastic about Ord cotton, Ord
cotton farmers are not at all enthusi-
astic about the delegation,
For the quaintly proper reason that
Australia has become a major customer
of Japanese cotton textiles, Japan seems,
prepared to start buying some of its
3.5 million bales of cotton a year from
Australia. By last week the first two-
contracts, for 6500 bales from W.A.
and 3000 bales from N.S.W., had been
announced. But on its return from a
tour of the Ord the delegation was
prepared to talk in far mightier terms
of an eventual 200,000 bales from that
area alone.
There are many if s and buts about
the proposal, not the least being that
its quality must be improved and the
quantity available considerably en-
larged.
The Japanese feel that once the main
dam has been completed on the Ord
quantity should present no problems,
But that discounts the current wane in
production. Last year 32 farmers
planted 11,800 acres to produce about
20,000 bales. This year 22 farmers will
possibly plant 8500 acres. They are
hoping for increased yields, but that
depends on weather conditions. Faced


with bankruptcy, the others have turned
their backs on cotton altogether. And
Japanese statements to date are hardly
likely to change many minds.
But the main reason for the farmers’
lack of enthusiasm is that the Japanese
are being very silent about price. They
say that if the quality is improved the
price will be improved. They say that
their practice is to buy cotton each
season at the going price. But they give
no indication of what the going price
is or could be. And they do not foresee
the Ord growers being offered long-
term Japanese contracts for their cot-
ton.
The delegation is also very non-
committal about W.A. Government
suggestions that a joint Japanese-
Australian venture will spin cotton into
thread up on the Ord for export to the
Japanese textile industries.
But the Japanese are none the less;
confident that after 1971, when the dam
is scheduled to be finished and the Ord
could be producing 200,000 bales of
cotton a year, they could be buying it.
By then, whatever the production on
the Ord, it could all well be an export
surplus problem, quite apart from cost
and quality difficulties. The Japanese
might be happy to take their 200,000
bales, but, faced with a distinct lack of
alternative markets, the farmers on the
Ord have every right to wonder just
what that “going price” could mean.
By the time the delegation had
reached Sydney last week, they were
ready to take all of the Australian
cotton surplus, as much as 280,000 bales
by 1971, but again only “if the price is
right.”
The Japanese are keen to encourage
all sources of supply of cotton, both to-
escape their dependence on the U.S.
and to force world market prices down
still further through surplus. And,
whatever the outcome of their present
blandishments, the future of cotton in
the total fibres market is far from
certain.
Official opinion on exporting cotton
from Australia is bluntly sceptical,
with Mr. Anthony, Minister for Primary
Industry, telling the growers to get
down to forming a national marketing
plan to pool returns from local and
export markets or else. The alternative,
and the Japanese have offered nothing
to change it, would be that those
unable to sell locally (mostly the Ord
growers) would have to bear the brunt
of a surplus by accepting considerably
lower returns from the bulk of exports.
But it is implied thp.t the Government
will allow no such alternative.
How it is to enforce such a
marketing scheme with the more suc-
cessful growers of the Eastern States,
particularly in the Namoi Valley of
N.S.W., so stoutly opposed to the idea,
is a tricky constitutional problem.
But, at least from reactions so far, it
seems unlikely that the Japanese visit
is going to aggravate the situation of
impending oversupply any further. If
anything, it has simply highlighted the
difficulties that are ahead.
MEN AND MATTERS
ERRATIC SUMMER WEATHER has
been playing dirty tricks on Bourke
Street’s Christmas shopping tallies this
year, when retailers confidently expected
the end of the drought would bring
them a bumper harvest. Contemplating
the grey skies from his red-carpeted
office looking out on the GPO clock,
Alan Walker, 47-year-old managing
director of the London Stores, Mel-
bourne’s oldest (1911) listed men’s wear
business, had reasons to be philosophi-
cal. The company has just spent a
packet of borrowed money on a new
arcade which opens up the store to
passersby as never before and business
was bucking up. Anyway, there was the
thought that Myer’s, across the way,
were in the same waterlogged trading
boat.
This Elizabeth Street corner is a very
old stamping ground of Mr. Walker’s.
Alan Walker
Jim Crawford
Take away three years of war service
with the 2/Bth Armoured, he’s been
making the daily trip to the London
Stores since the mid-’3os when, at
the age of 15, he joined it as a junior
salesman fresh from the State school,
at Dandenong, where his family had/ a
contracting business. Although in those
days store supervisors breathed rather
too close to his neck for his full com-
fort, Walker, who soon got to the buy-
ing side, has never regretted eschewing
the echelons of higher education, gath-
ering as he climbed up the executive’s
ladder all the expertise and knowhow
he needed.
London Stores’ little empire these
days extends far beyond the confines of
Bourke Street, where the business was
started 73 years ago by a London
clothier, F. S. Meyers (whose grandson
is on the present board and is otherwise
with Collins’ Book Depot), as the
London Tailoring Depot. Of the com-
pany’s four all-Victorian establishments
outside the city proper, it is some satis-
faction to Walker that the most thriv-
ing is in his old hometown, Dandenong
(the pace of industrial expansion there
has been as hot as anywhere in the
State since the war). There are also
stores at Geelong (pretty slow), Chapel
Street (not what it used to be), and
Camberwell (expansion possibilities
limited). ' There’s never been much
question of the firm launching far from
men’s wear, say into the department-
store business. Like The Leviathan, the
company has usually burnt its fingers
when venturing into women’s-wear ter-
ritory, but Mr. Walker thinks he now
has the answer in the new London
Stores arcade, with nine shops dealing
in luring extra lines practically inside
his doorstep.
WHEN J. C. (Jim) CRAWFORD
went to David Jones’ as an executive
trainee, the program was much simpler
than it is today. But he has justified
the management’s faith in him by
attaining last week the rank of asso-
ciate director, joining the company of
11 others, one rung below the nine
directors.on the board. Today, execu-
tive trainees spend two years apart,
attending a series of lectures pro-
grammed during the day and working
though a number of departments.
Crawford’s traineeship was inter-
rupted by service with the AIF, serving
in the Middle East, and he later became
a pilot. (He had gone straight from
Sydney Grammar to DJs at the end
of 1940.) At school Crawford repre-
sented Sydney Grammar in cricket,
Rugby Union, and athletics, and played
Rugby for combined GPS. So it is not
surprising that he keeps fit refereeing
Rugby Union football matches to-this
day. This is about the only extra-
curricular interest possible outside his
s|-day-week job, and the demands of
family and garden.
When Crawford returned post-war
to DJs he was appointed personal
assistant to the merchandise controller,
and ‘merchandising has been his forte
throughout his retailing career. He
became buyer in 1947, and after 12
years’ buying for many departments,
with seven trips to Western . Europe,
North America, and the Far East, he
became merchandise controller for the
men’s mercery group, one of the
largest trading groups in the company.
At least 80 percent of David Jones’
men’s mercery, travel goods, and sport-
ing goods is bought by women for their
menfolk. Overall it might be a reason-
able guess that 90 percent of a depart-
ment store’s sales are made to women.
But David Jones’, along with Myer’s,
Grace Brothers, Waltons, Woolworths,
and Coles, cannot boast of one woman
director, associate director, or executive
officer. Of perhaps 20 executive trainees
in DJs at the one time, four or five
may be women, but they are usually
casualties to the marriage market. At
present the highest-ranking woman in
David Jones’ is at buyer level. J

Speculator’s Diary
IF I HAD ANY BANK
SHARES, I'D GET
RID OF THEM AS WELL
ALL THIS fuss about good old
Gorton’s valiant efforts to keep good
old inefficient Australian companies in
good old incompetent Australian hands
overlooks one important poin;t. There
is already one section of Australian
business that is getting this sort of
protection right now from invaders
from overseas. That section is
made up of Australia’s five indigenous
free enterprise banks. They are inviolate
(among lots of other things). No one
can acquire them without the approval
of the Reserve Bank and that is not
likely to happen while the Govern-
ment’s policy is so strongly in opposi-
tion to the opening of foreign banks in
Australia. No matter how small are
the profits of these private enterprise
trading banks on the real value of their
assets, no corporate raider from over-
seas has a chance of a snowball in hell
of doing a Slater Walker on any one of
them, no matter how desperately needed
such an, assault might appear.
Not that it is all the banks’ fault;
Government policy has been a major
factor in keeping bank earning rates
down at absurdly low levels in relation
to the true value of ,the monumental
asssets that most of them own. It is
nevertheless hard to avoid the feeling
that, at least until recent times, the
banks have run pretty sleepy opera-
tions. Their unenthusiastic welcome to
the new commercial bill market, their
slow move into savings banks, their
reluctant follow-the-leader approach to
hire-purchase companies all suggest that
the height of their ambition has been
to run very efficient travel service
operations with a small profit from
their banking activities to help out.
But the ANZ and ES & A merger has
suddenly brought a new beauty to the
banks’ market image. The banks’ index
on the Sydney Stock Exchange has
galloped up to an absurd level of 268
points, or 20 percent higher than it was
in January. The market now hums with
rumors of merger's, takeovers, company
marriages, and even a polite form of
corporate incest. It is now taken for
granted that the Bank of Adelaide will
get knocked off by one of its big
brothers. There is talk over every coffee
table in Collins Street that the National
and the CBC have lots of things in
common (chiefly the fact that they
talked about a merger 40 years agoj.
Heaven knows, there is need for some
rationalising of banking services in Aus-
tralia; the proliferation of small bank
branches through the city and suburbs
suburbs in recent years has been fast
enougL to challenge the fate of growth
of fish shops under the old Deposit &
Investment management. But will this
u-ationalising come? There seems no
reason why it should. There is no likeli-
hood of any takeover threats from over-
seas (or anywhere else for that matter)
encouraging the banks to become
merger-minded. There are lots of things
they can do first before taking this step
if they are really keen to increase their
earnings to a reasonable level on their
assets. The first of these, of course,
is to acquire their finance company
associates. There is no doubt about the
significance of finance company profits
on bank incomes when it is a subsidiary.
Look at the ES & A Bank, which can
more aptly be described as a finance
company with a small banking opera-
tion on the side. And no doubt the
newly merged ANZESA Bank will
endeavor to come to terms with the
lAC.
This was the general theory that
prompted me to buy my holding in
Australian Guarantee Corporation, a
month or so ago, when it struck me
that the Bank of N.S.W. could well
acquire a few more shares in AGC to
make it a subsidiary and therefore boost
the bank’s earnings considerably. The
only big disadvantage with this sort of
thing is that it would probably give
the Reserve Bank greater control over
bank-affiliated finance companies than
it now has while they are legally
separate entities from the banks. In
any event, I think there is every chance
that all the banks will follow this year’s
lead from the CBA and acquire their
finance company associates and pos-
sibly some other finance companies, too,
if they decide they want painlessly to
acquire higher earnings. After all, they
should do something useful with the
whopping big premiums at present on
their shares. Nevertheless, I’ve decided
to quit my AGC shares at $2.42 be-
cause, no matter how sensible I think
its acquisition would be for the Bank
of N.S.W., I think the easiest way for
the Wales to do it would be for AGC
to issue shares to the bank rather than
for there to be any aquisition of exist-
ing shares either on the market or in
a bid. This being so, I’ve taken advan-
tage of the current market excitement
to make a small profit of $35.
And if I held any bank shares I’d
be selling them, too.
My only other sale of the week was
25 BH South contributing shares, which
brought in a profit of $43. Kitty now
stands at $230.

BRIEFLY
The GCOnomy . Second thoughts on overseas capital and
foreign takeovers have taken some of the heat out of
the previous week’s atmosphere . . . The Prime Minister and
his Government are, predictably, “engaged in a major
re-examination of overseas investment in Australia”:
Mr. Gorton now wishes the projected takeover control to
be more selective than his first-suggested restrictions
through the Stock Exchanges . . . Predictably, too, W.A.’s
Minister for Development, Mr. Charles Court, found
Mr. Gorton’s earlier statement embarrassing.
Mr. Gorton and the Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen,
have no basic divergencies on tariff policy, according
to Mr. Gorton: the Government, not the Tariff Board, makes
the decisions on tariff rates.
Australia’s gross national product is increasing at the rate
of eight percent a year (seasonally adjusted); the
September quarter saw a 10 percent advance when compared
with the corresponding 1967 period, and took some
help from improved rural conditions.
New and increased overdrafts from the trading banks
were approved at an average $29.3 million a week in the
four weeks to November 13 against $30.5 million in
the immediately previous period and $31.2 million
a year earlier.
The markets' Most investment sections are still looking
rather tame, though firm, on Australian share markets,
yet there’s no lack of individual situations to keep affairs
bubbling over. Bank shares, of course, are keeping
investors guessing and grabbing. Oils seem somewhat in
the doldrums, but a few metals are doing very well.
CRA naturally led the bunch, culminating in a $2.30
advance to $20.80. Western Mining added a good 50 cents,
finishing at $10.90, while BHP could only manage
a 10 cent rise to $19.30.
Instigators of the banks’ movements, ANZ put on 10 cents
to hit $9.60 and ESA a whole $1.24 in reaching $9.90.
Bank of N.S.W. went up 10 cents to $B.OO.
London eased up after a hectic week, with a few front-
rank issues dropping back.
Friday on Wall Street produced a solid advance
after prior consolidation.
Companies' Who could have thought that the outwardly
moribund banks would flutter the sacred and secretive
dovecotes so . . . Anyhow, the merger of the London-based
Australia and New Zealand Bank and the English
Scottish and Australian Bank has put the staid establishment
into all of a do-da; many sorts of fancy combines are
now being deduced. This particular union is to be
accomplished through a new holding company, Australian
and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., in which ANZ
and ESA become subsidiaries . . . On a more muted note,
the Australian Resources Development Bank (formed by
the eight trading banks and Reserve support) has
now approved loans totalling $ll9 million, although cash
actually drawn is $24 million.
An institutional blast of the trumpet came from the
chairman of Queensland Insurance, who asked, “Is a
tightening up contemplated of the conditions under which
investors will be permitted to take over established
Australian institutions?” He is receiving a medley of
answers . . . APA Holdings’ chairman, fresh from forcing
the decease of a first-come-first-served bid, believes stock
exchanges should permit life assurance companies to
refuse to register shares in the name of nominee companies.
Writhing in the toils of the U.K. Redland grip,
Concrete Industries has devised an escape plan which
limits the voting rights of “foreign” shareholders,
and is on the prowl for proxy support; Redland, now
owning a controlling interest in Concrete, will have none of
it, and has gone to the Equity Court . . . With a more
orthodox takeover, America’s F. W. Woolworth
group (not connected with the Woolworths) is offering
$3.4 million for Williams Shoes, which possesses a 61-store
chain . . . Dunlop Australia’s bid for suit-maker
Ernest Hiller (on a 2-for-15 basis) is approved by Hiller
directors . . . Lingerie and hosiery maker Hilton Corpora-
tion has embarked on “discussions” with an unnamed party.
Doing its best not to permit the miners to play second
fiddle, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia is launching its
third 3-for-10 bonus issue in four years, and dividends to
remain at 16 percent; there’s a feeling that a cash issue may
be in the offing . . . The Gove bauxite project, linking a
group of Australian companies and Swiss Aluminium,
will see 30 percent local participation and not the
earlier anticipated 50 percent ... Launceston-based
Endurance Mining is drilling a promising scheelite deposit
20 miles from Tamworth (N.S.W.) . . . The Mount
Painter (S.A.) uranium deposits have been upgraded by
Exoil, which is also drilling hopefully at Radium Ridge . . .
Beach sands miner Murphyores sows further disillusion
By forecasting a probable loss for the current year.
A 23 percent profit lift to $13,050,000 came to TCIANZ,
which then brought the four-year 71 percent dividend
up to 8 percent; earning rate is 10.3 percent . . .
Farm implement maker Massey-Ferguson (Australia) went
back from $2,516,310 to $2,060,755, reducing payment
to its Canadian parent from 19.5 to 17.1 percent;
the current year is viewed optimistically . . . Improved sales
have pushed William Adams’ half-year earnings up by
9.6 percent . . . Appliance maker and heavy engineer
A. G. Healing sees “an improving trend toward
rehabilitation” . . . Negotiations to acquire H. G. Palmer’s
$4B million tax losses are apparently at an “advanced
stage.”

MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS * THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
TWO EVENTS LAST WEEK clearly
showed that the Federal Government
must not only assume greater respon-
sibilities in fields covered by the
securities industry, but also show more
initiative in regulating the effects of
the inflow of overseas capital into
Australia.
The first event was the interruption
to the placid banking scene by the
merger of the Australian and New
Zealand Bank Ltd. and the English,
Scottish, and Australian Bank Ltd. into
Australia’s $3145 million, second-largest
banking group. This move will appre-
ciably increase competition among the
trading banks operating in Australia,
and subject several other banks to
intensified pressures to rationalise and
merge. It will also have big repercus-
sions in the hire-purchase finance sector.
The second event was the winning
by the British Redland Ltd. group of
the first round of the battle for Con-
crete Industries (Monier) Ltd., by
acquiring just over half the company’s
issued capital. Redland is now con-
solidating its position before the general
meeting on January 3, at which ClM’s
board will try to block the takeover
by pushing through a special resolution
to alter the company’s articles in such
a way as to limit the voting power of
foreign-held shares at any meeting to a
maximum of 20 percent. The Redland-
CIM struggle has now moved into the
stage of proxy battles, general meet-
ings, and legal moves and has already
got into the courts.
Both the ANZ-ESA merger and the
Redland-CIM contest have focused
attention on vital principles of economic
policy which the Federal Govern-
ment has so far dealt with on an
emergency fire-brigade basis, im-
provising under heavy pressure and on
the spur of the moment, as in the MLC
case. The ANZ-ESA merger and the
Redland-CIM affair are not un-
connected in a broad sense. There is
considerable merit in the suggestion
that the merger of the two London-
controlled banks, which have become
an integral part of the Australian scene,
was prompted by well-founded fears of
ESA’s vulnerability to a disastrous raid
by overseas interests anxious to enter
into the Australian banking business.
More - than anything else, this is :
defensive merger. It makes the two
“Anglo - banks” Australia’s second-
largest trading bank, with big hire-
purchase interests, and protects it
against potential overseas bidders not
only by its size, but also by virtue of
the fact that the Federal Government
could not remain indifferent in the case
of a foreign takeover attack against
the merged group. The trading banks
industry is closed to foreign interests.
But it is increasingly affected by inter-
national banking trends toward mergers
into big and powerful groups and in-
tensification of global operations. Aus-
tralian trading banks also face steeply
rising demand for capital, making Aus-
tralia a tempting area for large over-
seas banking groups anxious to expand
their business and spread their risks.
Australia’s economic growth, big
mineral finds, expanding industry, and
increasing population require a con-
tinuous flow of investment capital from
overseas. Domestic capital generation
is still inadequate and a large propor-
of the funds available is attracted more
strongly by speculative and semi-
speculative ventures than by promising
THE CHARTIST SAYS: Lend Lease Corporation Ltd. appears to be
entering into a new “growth” phase in terms of market appreciation. After the
peak in 1962, it settled into a downtrend and a low of 70c was achieved in
1966 during the base consolidation. A rise to at least $2 was the first potential
move and the overall picture now suggests a further short-term move to about
$2.80, with the potential of a more optimistic move to approximately $3.20. Any
price rise above $2.20 in the short term would be a confirmation of a breakout
from the recent congestion area. Last sale price on 12/12/68 $2.10.
but more long-term investment oppor-
tunities.
The inflow of overseas capital must
be maintained and encouraged. How-
ever, at the same time Australia cannot
put her natural wealth and whole
-sectors of her industry on, the auction
table.
This creates a difficult problem, com-
plicated by the' fact that many tradi-
tional sources which supply Australia
with capital have found themselves
under various forms of capital export
restrictions.
Any measures taken by the Federal
Government in this situation must be
selective and flexible enough to achieve
a substantial degree of control without
scaring off foreign investment capital.
“Imaginative selectivity” is the key
cliche in this case. Nothing is more
likely to frighten away overseas in-
vestment —at a time when new restric-
tions on portfolio outflow are expected
in Britain—than panic moves prompted
by hysteria and jingoistic demands for
wholesale protection against the wicked
foreigners.
ClM’s voting scheme may be accept-
able only as a last-ditch defensive move
in an extremely awkward situation. It
is an act of desperation with several
repugnant features, such as open load-
ing of the dice against non-Australian
shareholders with a virtually retroactive
effect. The Federal Government’s inter-
vention in the MLC crisis also was an
act of desperation and Government
policy simply cannot become a series
of improvisations.
It is pointless to try to stampede the
Government into taking immediate but
hasty measures to protect local equity.
However, the near-hysterical atmos-
phere on the Australian share markets,
generated by the latest rash of take-
overs, market raids, and Redland’s
bold attack on CIM is doing just that.
This is a time for sober reflection be-
fore decisive action which will influence
the flow of overseas investment capital
into Australia for a considerable time.
At least, it is evident that almost every-
body concerned recognises the need for
Government intervention, and this is a
valuable thing.
The Government will have to con-
sider a number, of methods. There cer-
tainly will be a need for some legis-
lative action as well as for administra-
tive fiscal measures. However, a lot
can be achieved by the Government
simply serving clear notice that it will
intervene if certain key companies or
sections of an industry in vital areas
will be in danger of passing under
overseas control* Most countries pro-
tect certain areas of their economic
activity from foreign control, and this
is accepted by all and does not dis-
courage overseas investment. But it is


important for the foreign investor to
know where he stands and how far he
can go. The majority of overseas in-
vestors do n.ot seek to buy out Aus-
tralian companies, and are content to
have a safe and profitable investment
in their portfolios.
Whatever combination of legislative,
administrative, and political measures
may be decided upon, there is an
obvious need for closer links between
the securities industry and the Federal
Government. The idea of setting up a
securities commission is certainly worth
exploring. Such a body could reflect
both the Government’s policy and pro-
tect the more sectional interests of the
securities industry.
BANK MERGER
WHAT HAPPENS TO IAC?
THE ANZ-ESA merger has specific
sharemarket aspects quite apart from
the more general issues it raises. Share-
holders in both banks have benefited
by an effective bonus, but the future
of lAC Holdings Ltd. remains un-
decided.
ANZ has a 21.7 percent interest in
lAC, its hire-purchase outlet, while
ESANDA is wholly owned by ESA. It
is unlikely that the two hire-purchase
groups will continue to operate in com-
petition with each other and it is the
stated intention of the newly formed
Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (“Holdings”) to preserve
its interest in lAC.
This makes it unlikely that the
merged bank would sell its holdings in
lAC. Quite apart from the stated in-
tention to preserve the new bank’s
equity in lAC, such a move would
involve abandoning an appreciable
portion of the hire-purchase market.
The market boost to lAC shares follow-
ing the announcement of the merger
seems to indicate that the market ex-
pects the merged bank to buy out the
publicly held lAC shares at a good
price. This would open the door to
a merger between, lAC and ESANDA,
an . energetic profit earner, and make
the ANZ-ESA banking group a formid-
able force in hire-purchase finance.
ICIANZ
CAPITAL SPENDING PAYS
ICIANZ has so many irons in the
industrial fire that a generalised pre-
liminary statement of the group’s
results for any year is bound to leave
most of the intriguing questions
unanswered. However, the general im-
pression gained from last week’s state-
ment for the year to September 30,
for which earnings were lifted from
10.8 to 13.4 percent and the dividend
was moved up to 8 percent after four
successive years at on the $9 million
ordinary capital, is that the group’s
massive capital expenditure in the last
few years is at last beginning to pay
off. The build-up of prior charges is
still a thorn in the equity holders’ side,
of course, even if, as now expected,
earnings per share increase appreciably.
To what precise extent the good
result last year was a reflection of the
mcjre generous tariff benefits resulting
from the 1966 Tariff Board report on
the chemicals industry, equally good
treatment afforded synthetic fibres in
this respect and to the generally much
more buoyant economy of this last
year, the statement doesn’t say. It
mentions that the devaluation of the
N.Z. dollar adversely affected returns
from across the Tasman (and necessi-
tated some adjustments to book values
of assets in Australian dollar terms).
But the 80 percent ICIANZ-owned
N.Z. subsidiary increased its profit by
17.3 percent and its dividend from 8
to 9 percent last year, so, on balance,
the net effect on the group figures of
N.Z. operations could not have been
much changed from the previous year.
Considering the group’s turnover
dropped marginally last year, the tax
provision failed to take as much benefit
from tax allowances on capital expen-
diture. The actual profit out-run augurs
well for the current year, when, for one
thing, fertiliser sales, which were
affected by the drought last term,
should rise considerably.
Mining
CONSOLIDATED RUTILE
AND CUDGEN
HAVE SEEN THE WORST
LAST WEEK closed with the
encouraging announcement of a third
bonus issue (a 3-for-10) by Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia Ltd, capitalising
$11,939,870 of the share premium
reserve. Directors say the 16 percent
annual dividend rate will be maintained
on the bonus-enlarged capital.
Meanwhile, the market appears to be
expecting continued improvement in
production from Consolidated Rutile
Limited. Since the beginning of the
month, the shares have moved from
$1.30 to $1.50 and are at present hold-
ing very firmly' around $1.40. Late in
October, production for the first
quarter of the current year showed a
considerable improvement over pre-
vious operations, with rutile production
reaching 6668 tons and zircon 4382
tons. These compare with an average
of some 4600 tons of rutile and 4500
tons of zircon for each of the previous
year’s quarters. Although close to the
original production estimates published
in the prospectus late in 1965 of 30,000
tons and 25,000 tons per annum of
rutile and zircon respectively, there still
remains room for improvement to the
increased capacity figures of 38,000
tons of rutile and 31,500 tons of zircon,
but the recovery which the company’s
shares are experiencing on the market
seems to indicate that the second
quarter of the current year will show
a further improvement.
Last year, the company earned
$220,000 after considerable difficulties
in the dry mill treatment plant at
Meeandah. Based on a full year’s pro-
duction of some 30,000 tons of rutile
and 25,000 tons of zircon, the prospec-
tus estimated an annual profit of just
over $1 million, which seemed fair
enough on the rule-of-thumb basis that
the sales of rutile cover the total costs
of the operation and sales of zircon, are
all profit (at around $4O per ton).
Using the same basis, the September
production figures, if maintained for
a full year would see a profit of about
$700,000, or perhaps more if produc-
tion improves any further up to the
9500 tons of rutile throughput for
which the plan is designed.
Any improvement in Consolidated
Rutile would be welcomed by holders
of Cudgen R.Z., which has also had
its troubles. Last year, Cudgen, brought
in a profit of $816,000 after tax. Pre-
tax profit of $883,000 was only about
half the figure of $1,658,000 which the
group estimated when going public.
The big profit fall was due to higher
costs and lower shipments in the first
half of the year, while in the second
half of the year difficult mining condi-
tions added further to costs.
In all, last year Cudgen produced
68,721 tons of rutile and zircon com-
bined which was well in excess of the
62,855 tons estimated in its prospectus;
since the close of the year, operating
efficiency has improved noticeably, with
the first quarter’s production of 18,141
tons of rutile and zircon combined
against a similar figure for the June
quarter and a low 13,691 tons in the
March quarter. Should the balance of
the year maintain the current quarter’s
production without difficulty, last year’s
profit should be easily exceeded. At
this stage it may be too early to become
enthusiastic about these trouble-prone
companies, but it looks as though the
worst has now been seen.
Behind the
balance sheets
PITT, SON, BADGERY
IS TEMPTING
THROUGH ITS ASSETS
TJURINGA SECURITIES’ $l5 mil-
lion cash bid for the London-based
Australian, Mercantile, Land and
Finance Co. Ltd. may have inspired
the sudden, but short-lived, market


interest in the N.S.W. woolbroker and
stock and station agent Pitt, Son and
Badgery Ltd. In the first week in
December, nearly 100,000 stock units
(7 percent of the issued capital)
changed hands and the buying pressure
pushed the price of Pitt Son shares
from $2.12 to $2.80. A usual turnover
is more like 2000 shares a week. The
shares remain firm at $2.72 to yield
4.4 percent in income, and 6.5 percent
on earnings, compared with the big
woolbrokers and pastoral houses
Dalgety-N.Z. Loan with 4.0 percent
and 5.2 percent respectively, and Elder
Smith-Goldsbrough Mort with 3.5 per-
cent and 7.3 percent respectively.
Although the southern half of the
State, especially the South Coast, is
still afflicted by drought, seasonal
conditions in N.S.W. generally are
better. But the prospects of improved
earnings have already been well antici-
pated in the current market price. To
warrant this price there has to be antici-
pation of a takeover merchant round
the corner. The identity of the buyer
or buyers of Pitt, Son and Badgery’s
shares has remained a mystery. The
spread of share holdings is such that,
at least at last September, no one
holder had more than 4 percent of the
capital. The University of Adelaide
and two church property trusts were
surprisingly large holders, and 12 insur-
ance and trustee companies, which
would be impressed by the long record
of continuous dividends, could muster
about 18.5 percent of issued capital
between them.
Sixteen bonuses between 1888 and
1929 was a remarkable record, but
there have been only three since World
War II the best a one-for-two in
1950, the last a one-for-20 in 1957. Pitt
Son’s issue of 166,398 $2 notes in 1957,
which converted to shares in' 1963,
showed that real bonuses (as distinct
from straight watering of capital, with
no concomitant income benefits) are a
thing of the past. Dividends were a
steady 13 percent until the 1966
drought, which cut the payout to 11
percent, with recovery to 12 percent in
the past two years.
On a national basis, Pitt Son ranked
ninth for bales of wool received into
store in 1967-68. It sells only through
Sydney and Newcastle. Last year’s sales
were almost equal to the 1965 level,
after two drought-affected years. The
1965-66 drought reduced sheep numbers
in N.S.W. by almost 12 ’million;
although there has been recovery in
numbers in the past two years, sheep
numbers are still 4.9 million down on
1965 levels. Decreasing costs in syn-
thetic fibres continue to have a
depressing effect on, wool prices. Greasy
wool prices shrank another 5c to 44c
a pound, compared with 72c for the
company in 1964, illustrating the plight
of the whole wool industry. Expenses,
wages, taxes, rates, and interest are
going up. Costs of the client’s yearly
turnover rise, which means that he is
deeper in debt to the stock and station
agent. Pitt Son’s net debtors rose almost
10 percent this past year, which also
reflects some restocking after the
drought. The company makes finance
available against wool and stock,
purely on a yearly basis, charging 7
percent or a little more, according to
bank rate.
The woolbroker’s role of shouldering
the burden of financing the grazier has
built up chiefly in the past decade.
There is no visible alternative for Pitt
Son and its competitors to this banking
role, but the return is not very satis-
factory to the shareholders. The com-
pany itself has to borrow from the
bank and indebtedness rose $647,000
over the year to June to $1,116,000.
The current ratio still looks healthy
enough.
With a lid on revenue and pressure
from costs, survival depends on
economies. The chairman, Mr. J. D.
MacLeod, says the major problem is in
the ever-increasing costs which face the
wool producers. He sees room for con-
siderable savings here and little
advantage in argument about the
means of marketing the wool clip.
The larger pastoralists and wool-
brokers saw salvation in amalgamation;
so do the bankers right now. There
must surely be benefits for companies
of Pitt Son’s size to get together and
pool their resources. With 14 branch
offices, Pitt Son provides the usual
facilities and supplies to the man on the
land—insurance, travel and accommo-
dation, wines and spirits (they are dis-
tributors for Ainslie’s Scotch whisky),
and other merchandise.
Net tangible asset backing is $3.32
per $1 share, but Pitt Son’s properties
could be grossly undervalued. The head
office is at 4 O’Connell Street, Sydney,
acquired about 60 years ago. It is now
in the heart of the city’s financial area,
surrounded by new buildings rising to 30
storeys, which makes the courtyard of
potted palms surrounded by galleried
storeys (three or four at the back, seven
on the street) incongruous, indeed. Only
a couple of these floors are occupied
by the firm the rest are tenanted. In
1957 freeholds were in the books at
$1,038,000. The VG valuation then
showed $1,070,000 in excess of book
value, and the company decided to
write them up by $439,000. Thus, they
were in the 1958 books at about 70
percent of VG’s valuation. O’Connell
Street properties are worth anything
from $l5O to $2OO a square foot,
depending on the size of the site. Values
have multiplied four or five times in
the past ten or 11 years, about doubling
in the past two years.
In the latest year, the company shovvs
an increase in land and buildings of
$221,000, accounted for by the purchase
of an additional wool store to supple-
ment the main one at Pyrmont, which
had been inadequate ,for many years.
It also has a store at Newcastle. The
additional stores eliminated the need to
rent additional space, and resulted in
an “appreciable cost saving.” Part of
this saving was used to create a special
provision for depreciation, and $20,000
was set aside against the cost of this
recently acquired building.
If earnings are not adequate in
relation to present-day values and to
funds employed, liquidation may be
very attractive to others outside the
industry. AMLF directors took little
regard of asset values, as they considered
the company a continuing trading con-
cern and had no thought of liquidation.
Only when Tjuringa made the take-
over offer did they suddenly discover
the value of assets applicable to share-
holders was about £stg,l7 million
instead of the £stg.7.9 million shown
in the accounts.

Security analysis
A"GO-GO" ENGINEER
AND BUILDER IS
LEIGHTON CONTRACTORS
TWICE IN RECENT weeks I have
recommended investment in property
development companies, using the
theme of “bricks and mortar.” There
is, however, a “bricks and mortar”
stage more basic than the developers,
and as the great building boom con-
tinues its strong upsurge my thoughts
are turning to the construction and
civil engineering companies. Most listed
companies in this category are already
well priced, proving that one doesn’t
have to be a. security analyst to know
a gopd stock. But Leighton Contractors
seems to me to be a company with
plenty of mileage left for growth-
conscious investors.
Since 1964, Leighton’s net profit
after tax has shot up over 500 percent,
from $102,000 to around $525,000,
while total assets have more than
doubled and shareholders’ funds have
gone from $876,000 to $2,255 million.
In 1964, earning rate on capital was
13.2 percent; today it is 52.6 percent.

The ratios of net profit to shareholders’
funds and pre-tax profit to total assets
are now 23.2 and 19.4 percent respec-
tively, compared with 11.6 and 8.5
percent in 1964. On these figures,
Leighton is growing faster than the
industry, even in the boom, and cer-
tainly qualifies as a go-go stock.
Additional financial figures of interest
to investors are a current price/earnings
ratio of only 7.2 and a dividend yield
of four percent on the 15 percent
dividend.
All this has taken place in just six
years since Leighton became a public
company in 1962. In 1949, Leighton
Pty. opened shop in Australia as a
subsidiary of a large and successful
English contracting group and
continued operations as private civil
engineers and building contractors until
1962, when it was acquired by the
present company. These days Leighton
is managed and staffed by Australians,
with a majority of the shares under
Australian control.
Group operations are split about 50
percent each between building and
civil engineering, with Leighton doing
very well in both fields. In itself this
is unusual, as there are few companies
which are equally successful in the two
areas. Leighton sees each side of the
business complementing the other and,
by having its strength balanced, the
company manages to get the best of
both worlds.
Among notable jobs under construc-
tion Leighton is building the $7 million
Stage II of the Tulla'marine terminal
building; the Randwick migrant hostel
($3.6 million); Commonwealth offices
worth $4 million at Woden in the
A.C.T.; the St. Kilda Junctioq
redeveloprtient scheme; and roads, car--
parks, concrete aprons, and hard-
standings for the new terminal at
Sydney’s Kingsford-Smith Airport. As
well as these jobs the group has been
building rock walls for beach protec-
tion on Queensland’s Gold Coast under
three contracts. Other contracts have
recently been secured covering the first
Coles “K” Mart, at Blacktown
(N.S.W.), worth $1.25 million, and the
civil engineering foundations and- site-
works for the natural gas installations
at Sale and Western Port Bay, Victoria.
Leighton has had a number of con-
tracts from the Commonwealth
Covern'ment and has completed army
accommodation at Holsworthy Carrip
($5 million); further accommodation
at Puckapunyal Camp ($2.2 million),
and the Watsonia Army Signal Centre
in Victoria ($l.B million). A continuing
long-term engineering contract for
subdivisional work in Canberra, spread
over four years, is due for completion
within the next six months, and a new
three-year contract is due to co'mmence
shortly. All these jobs, plus others,
add up to about $32 million in work
in progress uncompleted and will keep
Leighton busy well into the future.

interesting structure, being split
between two divisions, Southern and
Northern. The Southern Division, based
on Melbourne, is responsible for
activities in Victoria and Tasmania,
S.A., and Western Australia, while the
Sydney headquarters of Northern
Division deals with New South Wales,
Queensland, Canberra, and the North-
ern Territory. Each Division is con-
trolled by a director who is an engineer,
with H. E. Kennedy responsible for
the Southern area and S. L. Wallis
handling Northern operations. Chief
executive B. M. Hedley oversees all
group interests from Melbourne.
Leighton’s chairman is S. E. Leighton,
who divides his year between Australia
and his family interests in the United
Kingdom.
As part of its expansion program
Leighton has set up a project-manage-
ment division to provide clients with
a “package deal” covering a complete
service for design, construction, and
management of major projects. The
new activity has been under way for
about 12 'months and I understand it
is turning in good results. Leighton sees
a big future in this area, as the trend
for having projects carried out under
one roof gains momentum.
As an adjunct to the civil engineering
side of the business, Leighton has been
actively engaged in preliminary mining
investigations in Queensland during the
past six to nine months. At this stage
operations are confined to survey work,
but the group expects to commence test
drilling some time in the New Year.
The group’s overall philosophy is one
of controlled expansion, increasing
depth of management, and an up-to-
date analytical approach to diversi-
fication. Leighton is interested in
getting into any field it thinks it has
the managerial ability, financial
resources, and the technical skill to
handle, but does not intend to diversify
purely for the sake of growth alone.
If the past six years are any guide,
future developments should be highly
profitable, and I expect Leighton to
'maintain its outstanding record, even
if the construction boom does taper off
a little.

Summary: Leighton is performing
remarkably well, as the figures
and further growth is indicated. The
50-cent shares are currently priced at

7.2 and a dividend yield of 4.0 percent.

Peculiar People” a work of literature.
Maybe a negative answer was expected
—mine was an unqualified “Yes.”
There is a great deal of nonsense
spoken and written at present about
“creative writing”—what is literature,
what journalism, what history, science,
geography, or whatever? These con-
siderations did not hamper the giants
of the 19th century who crossed and
recrossed the artificial borderlines
which we, in our unwisdom, seem
determined to define.
Let it be said, then, that Gavin
Souter is a journalist who writes with
admirable clarity and can make a story,
period, and cast of people come alive—
exciting, absurd, and gallant by turns.
Since the story of William Lane’s
Utopia is important in our history,
literature, and sociology, this volume is
worth every cent of taxpayers’ money
spent on it.
From 1893 onward, groups of social-
istically minded Australians established
already-legendary settlements in Para-
guay. Souter explores the motives of
William Lane, the leader, and his
followers. He describes how they fared
in South America, and tells what
became of many of them and of their
descendants, some of whom are third-
generation Paraguayan citizens bearing
Australian surnames.
Nearly all crusades, n6w religions,
utopian endeavors, and crazy enter-
prises, whether they succeed, nearly.
succeed, or deserve to succeed, begin,
as New Australia began, in the mind
of some complex, visionary, crackpot
kind of man. William Lane “has some-
times been called Australia’s Lenin,
but the analogy is ludicrous. Where
Lenin was cold and practical, Lane was
emotional and theoretical: his socialism
was steeped in sentiment.” It was cer-
tainly steeped in illogicality. Lane con-
ceived his scheme during the shearers’
strike of 1891-93, of which, as editor
of the Brisbane “Worker,” he was
“arch-conspirator.” He was a puritanical
man whose ideal socialist practised
“mateship” through thick and thin, but
within narrow bounds of morality and
color.
The basis for membership of his
New Australia Co-operative Settlement
Association disqualified any who did
not know “English so as to understand
and be understood; any person of color,
including any married to persons of
color; any living together otherwise
than in lawful marriage; any of ques-
tionable reputation; any objectionable
by reason of past disloyalty to the
Labor movement, or of such other
actions as are clearly opposed to the
common good.” Initially, too, a pledge
of teetotalism was to prevail this
proved one of the hardest conditions to
enforce.
Souter traces the history of Lane’s
movement; its members, organisation,
financing, planning, and proselytising.
A ship, the Royal Tar, was chartered,
and despite every problem of the time,
and all the objections so plainly visible
to Souter’s hindsight, some 480 people
reached New Australia between 1893
and 1896. For a time it seemed as if
they might make the dotty scheme
work. The settlers came from every
walk of life. Shearers and pastoral
workers with their families predomin-
ated, but shopkeepers, tradesmen, and
even a future Professor of Classics
embarked. In a later group came young
Mary Cameron (Dame Mary Gilmore),
as imbued with illogical enthusiasm as
was Lane, her leader. Early, the settle-
ment split into two groups. One
remained at New Australia and one,
loyal to Lane, started afresh at nearby
but inaccessible Cosme.
In both places, quite apart from
economic and organisational difficulties,
personal likes and dislikes and preju-
dices were always a great problem,
particularly among the women, who
were expected to share communally
not only work but personal possessions
like sewing machines. Their life had
all the disadvantages of existence in a
small country town from which there
was no possibility of escape no
chance of a brief holiday elsewhere, no
visiting relatives only remoteness
and reliance upon not always congenial
companions for ever and ever and
ever. Unless one left. Leaving was
difficult financially and psychologically,
but many made the break to work
(or starve) in South America and
other places a few to return to
Australia. William Lane himself
departed and subsequently seemed to
repudiate many of his early ideals. This
puritanical socialist with his strange
religious fervor was always, however,
firmly devoted to the British Empire
and all it stood for.
“Deeply as I revere the memory
of Lane,” wrote one of his earliest
followers, Harry Taylor, “honesty
would compel 'me to say that at times
the human nature that seemed most
to fail the Paraguayan Commune was
that of Lane himself . . . though he
never lost in sincerity and personal
integrity, he became, in time, a centre
of repulsion rather than of attraction.”
When his brother John Lane was told
of William’s death, he said: “He died
many years ago.”
John Lane, a schoolteacher and a far
more stable dreamer than William, was
a remarkable man in his own right. In
1902 he journeyed in Western Aus-
tralia, South Australia, and New South
Wales and Queensland trying to
recruit suitable men to shore up the
rickety structure of Cosme. This trip
was undertaken in midsummer, during
a terrible drought, and from Adelaide
to Broken Hill and thence through
White Cliffs to Glen Innes he rode
a bicycle! He also cycled through much
of Western Queensland. Like so much
in Souter’s crowded pages this epic
journey merits a book to itself. It was
as unproductive as it was gallant —•
Australian conditions had altered,
thought and politics had changed, and
Lane, apostle of Cosme, preached a
lost cause.
Many interesting life histories can be
traced through the book. Walter Head,
for instance, first appears as Secretary
of the Australian Shearers’ Union at
Wagga during the 1891 strikes. He was
treasurer of the New Australia Co-
operative Settlement Association, but
never made the journey to Paraguay
although one of his sons did. Head
remained to steer the complicated
affairs of the Association in Australia
through mazes of muddle, mystery, and,
perhaps, mismanagement. Yet, he was
as idealistic as Lane, and some of his
difficulties stemmed from a dreadful
personal tragedy, of which Henry
Lawson wrote in one of his stories. As
Head this man disappeared, but after
a period in New Zealand he lived in
Tasmania as W. A. Woods, Member
of Parliament, editor of a Labor news-
paper, and is best remembered as a
writer of excellent Bush Ballads using
the pseudonym “John Drayman.”
Head’s sad loss of a son split his
family. It was only one of many disas-
trous occurrences described by Souter.
The descendants of many Paraguayan
pioneers seem, both in Australia and
elsewhere, to have been prone to sudden
deaths, two separate level-crossing
horrors among them.
Mary Gilmore, at first impossibly
enthusiastic, then increasingly disillu-
sioned, and finally completely disen-
chanted, dominates many pages. So do
less-well-known personalities who take
on flesh and life. The end section con-
cerns Gavin Souter’s own journey to
New Australia and Cosme. He met with
survivors and descendants, and was
successful in bringing back to Australia
three young men whose forebear, Billy
Wood, a Murrumbidgee shearer, “had
been the promptest donor in Henry
Lawson’s short story “Send Round the
Hat.”
An index and many well-chosen
photographs add to the book’s interest,
as does an appendix giving as full as
possible a list of emigrants to New
Australia and Cosme, together with
births at Cosme. A second appendix
prints “Songs and Verse of New Aus-
tralia and Cosme.” Among the verse
is Hilda Lane’s widely know “The Man


from Bogantungan.” Miss Lane, John’s
daughter, was born at Cosme. She now
lives in Queensland, and when “A
Peculiar People” was published recently,
the publishers invited her to a function.
Miss Lane had helped Souter with his
research but had not seen his manu-
script. She told me that she had replied
declining to accept the invitation unless
she approved of the book. An advance
copy met her very high standard, and
she gladly made the journey. I record
her approval, because it seems more
worthwhile praise than any I can
accord this unusual and important work.
INSTANT PUBLIC HELL
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Cancer Ward. Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
Bodley Head. $3.90.
IF THE WRITERS of our time have
a common message, it must surely be
that hell is here and now. There is no
need for deep literary diggings below
the surface to find today’s infernos, no
necessity to look far for Lucifer when
modern man runs an express service
right to the door. In “The First Circle”
(a deliberate reference to Dante’s
“Divine Comedy,” of course) and in
“A Day in the Life of Ivan Deniso-
vitch,” Alexander Solzhenitsyn has
explored those instant public hells the
20th century’s labor and concentration
camps, even boldly unmasking the octo-
pus “familiar” of his own personal
Hades, the Stalin-monster. “Cancer
Ward” is a vast, terrifying expansion
of the same theme. It is a dual-edged
confrontation, a head-on collision
between two of the scourges of modern
man—one that has attacked the mind
and one that is attacking the body.
Like his colleagues Sinyavsky and
Daniel, Solzhenitsyn was once also
imprisoned, but his books reveal that
his mind has escaped free and
unharmed. He is still forced to write
in a void without an audible echo: not
one of his major novels, although they
are set in the time of the fallen god of
the Kremlin, has ever been published
in Russia, and none is likely to be at
present. Together they form in fictional
shape an indictment of the practical
ills of the system under Stalin, which
is the more compelling for its calm
rational statement of fact, without
polemics or soapbox oratory, with only
an occasional underlying tinge of run-
ning irony. With all that has come out
of the East above or below the Curtain
in recent times, these three major novels
should place Alexander Solzhenitsyn
among the most important, perhaps
even as the most important.
“Cancer Ward” is a mammoth
masterpiece which appears destined
■ultimately to take its place somewhere
between Camus’ “Plague” and Thomas
Mann’s “Magic Mountain.” As Mann
used tuberculosis, so Solzhenitsyn uses
cancer to cut off a small typical cell of
individuals and isolate them from the
mainstream of life, in the tightly closed
inner circle of a hospital ward; there
the author’s own pathology tests are
not confined merely to the medical
case-histories of the patients. Just as
Camus’ “Plague” was double-headed,
the rats and their pestilence being
symbols of Nazism, so Solzhenitsyn’s
“crab” is also a political life-force that
has gone mad and turned in on itself,
multiplying mindlessly on the living
tissue of the individual.
In fact, “Cancer Ward,” for all its
deceptively simple, free-flowing surface,
must be seen on three different levels:
the faithful, horrifying evocation of
that suppurating atmosphere peculiar
to cancer-wings of hospitals everywhere,
its detailed actuality accounts of ordin-
ary Soviet day-to-day living, and its
overall allegorical total. The author
unfolds, case by case, the background
of each of the inmates as it once was,
outside. (Through superstitious fear or
ignorance, many have left it too late
ever to return there again, but for a
better statistical success-account an
occasional hopeless patient is discharged
so he can get as far as the railway
station before he dies.)
Across this enormous yet concentrated
canvas there passes a variety of people
with every kind of tumor from the
relatively harmless to the worst of the
malignants, from the poorest vagabond
of the steppes to the newest aristocrat—
the high-ranking Party-machine mem-
ber Pavel Nikolayevich, who suddenly
could “summon no influential friend,
no past services, no defence” against
the enemy growing out of his own neck.
And there is the dedicated staff of
female doctors battling, in their primi-
tive provincial backwater, against loud-
speakers blaring canned music and
potted politics, patients overflowing
even down the none-too-clean stairs, the
scarcity of taps with running water,
and the sudden imperious summonses
to abandon the most seriously sick to
attend a compulsory Party-meeting.
As usual with Solzhenitsyn, much is
autobiographical; the central character,
Oleg Kostoglotov, has not only been
imprisoned but, like the author him-
self, is also being cured of cancer as
the book closes. Although it runs to
more than 300 closely packed pages and
is entirely self-contained, this present
volume is only Part I; the second
portion is to follow shortly. The English
by Nicholas Bethell and David Burg
reads effortlessly, but some of the trans-
lators’ footnotes, solemnly explaining
the meaning of terms like “personality
cult” or that Lermontov was a Russian
author, work out only as superfluous
clutter.
“Cancer Ward” is not for the
squeamish, but rising like a descant
above the stench of streaming pus and
rotting bodies, the injections, the X-rays,
and the blood-transfusions is the
triumphant song of the spirit. What
finally emerges are the real values of
Solzhenitsyn’s individual declaration of
rights: “The right to move about with-
out waiting for an order; the right to be
alone; the right to gaze at stars that
were not blinded by prison-camp
searchlights; the right to put the light
out at night and sleep in the dark;
the right to bathe in the river . . .
the right to breathe, to think, to express,
to be in charge of one’s own destiny, a
free man among free men.”
WHY PHILBY SUCCEEDED
By ROBERT O'NEILL
My Silent War. Kim Philby, with an
introduction by Graham Greene.
Macgibbon and Kee. $4.25.
ANOTHER SPY story would seem at
first glance to be a drug on the market.
Following in the wake of Fleming,
Deighton, and the host of other writers
on modern espionage, there seems little
that Philby can offer that has not been
described more excitingly in the pages
of fiction. His task has been made
doubly difficult by the recent appear-
ance of two excellent books on his life.
None the less, Philby has done it again.
He has succeeded against the longest
odds in convincingly donning artificial
personalities with an expertise which
might well be admired by inferior imita-
tors amongst most professions.
There is little in “My Silent War”
which is new or not spelt out in greater
detail in the two biographies mentioned
above. Philby appeals largely because
of the directness of his comment and
the brilliance of his characterisation. In
a tightly written book, which neverthe-
less leaves a great number of questions
unanswered, he seldom grants more
than a few lines to any notable who
crossed his career. Of Professor Trevor-
Roper he writes:
“All these men (including Trevor-
Roper) outclassed Cowgill (of the
Secret Intelligence Service) in brain-
power, and some of them could match
his combativeness. Trevor-Roper, for
instance, was never a meek academic;
and it was characteristic of Cowgill’s
other-worldliness that he should have
once threatened Trevor-Roper with
court martial.”
General Sir James Marshal Cornwall,
formerly the senior general in the
British Army, receives the comment: “If
he does not figure more prominently in
this narrative, it is because his influence
was ineffectual where it was not
unfortunate.”
These are not isolated sparklings of
Philby’s descriptive powers, for among
the multitude of such characterisations
are inserted epigrams such as: “Our
commandant, John Munn, was a young
colonel of the sensible military type, as
opposed to the no-nonsense military, the
mystical military, and the plain-silly
military.”
However, before one is swept away
by the rare enjoyment of reading clear,
unfudged, and apparently fearless com-
ments, it is prudent to examine their
objectivity. They were written by a
Soviet Secret Service agent who had
successfully penetrated the British
Secret Service to a very high level over
11 years. In 1963 Philby escaped by a

narrow margin to the Soviet Union.
The book was written in Moscow, and
the text reached the London publishers
from the Soviet Union. Is it likely that
any country would permit the foreign
publication of such a story by perhaps
its most successful spy without attempt-
ing more than the provision of enter-
tainment? In the field of intelligence,
such a publication has the peculiar
power that it cannot be refuted without
the nation, whose security system is
described, compounding its losses by
giving away even more information
about its closest secrets.
Hence, one ought to regard the
bumbledom attributed to the British
Secret Service by Philby with some
scepticism. Probably it is better than
Philby admits, or else it would not be
worth disparaging. At least it is unlikely
to be worse, and this is not discom-
forting, for several of the men Philby
describes would be worth their pay in
any nation’s secret service. The same
comments apply to his treatment of the
CIA, and, in particular, to relations
between the British and American
intelligence organisations.
The origins of the manuscript are
not described. Graham Greene says in
his introduction: “Don’t talk to me of
ghost writers: only Philby could have
been responsible for these (characterisa-
tions).”
As comment from one who knew
Philby well, this must be given weight.
However, the mistaken although
understandable use of a “from” instead
of an “of” on page 40 a mistake
surely too gross for a printer’s error
suggests that the manuscript was
translated into at least German in its
passage fro'm Philby’s pen through the
Soviet bureaucracy to the British
publishers.
The shock of Philby’s success over
the British Secret Service may conjure
up a picture of him as the brilliant,
detached mastermind for whom
unparalleled feats of espionage were
only to be expected. Philby’s few
comments on himself quickly dispel
this notion with a more convincing
picture of a man who worked very
hard, carrying home bulging brief-
cases of papers to work on at night,
living very much on his nerves, and
falling victim to moderate alcoholism.
It is interesting to see that he achieved
progress in the British Secret Service
largely through hard work and
efficiency as a British e'mployee. His
indirect usefulness to the Soviet Union
depended greatly upon his direct use-
fulness to Britain, and so it is an
ironically open question as to which
master Philby served the better.
The sustaining of his motivation
raises another question: was he able
to maintain his devotion to Com-
munism because of continued positive
appeal, or was he continually being
driven to this inner refuge of attitudes
through reaction to his environment?
In other words, would a man of this
temperament have been just as likely
to give his ultimate loyalty to
Capitalism, had he lived in a Com-
'munist society?
There are many more dilemmas raised
in “My Silent War,” including the
obvious one which will never escape
mankind who checks the checkers?
If Philby’s to be explained in terms
of reaction against his society, he may
not be an isolated phenomenon.
WRITER TO WATCH
By FRANK KING
Montgomery and I. Geoff Baker.
Georgian House. $l.OO.
GEOFF BAKER is a final year Arts
student, aged 21, at Melbourne Univer-
sity. “Montgomery and I” is his first
published novel (another is completed),
and Baker’s is a name to watch, for in
some ways this is an uncommon book.
For instance, Baker seems to have
said: “Most first books are autobiog-
raphical: those by the young are
notoriously self-pitying. I shall ‘send
up’ both these traits, and exploit them.”
The x'esult is a short book in which
each chapter, or section, is written in
a different mode. Were the book any
longer the resultant gimmicky effect
would become wearisome it is just
short enough for it to delight.
Chapter 1 sets the scene and intro-
duces the author, who is also Mont-
gomery, notices the conflicts between
this duo, and ends with an amusing
mock questionnaire.
In Chapter 2 Montgomery takes a
train to the city and plays a game in
his mind concerning the names of
stations on the line. We learn many of
his opinions, doubts, fantasies, and never
forget for a moment how young he is.
Chapter 3 gets him on to a univer-
sity-bound bus. It’s a chapter of mis-
haps. Our poor hero endures the
paranoia of adolescence —everyone is
looking at me.
Chapter 4, between Montgomery and
the author again, reveals more of the
hero’s dreams, which are to be fully
explored by Section 5, which, though
perhaps a trifle drawn-out, is the
clincher. It is a scholarly edition, with
Introduction and Commentary by M.
Author, dated 2458 (4th edition 2467)
of a “gospel” called “The happenings
According to Kanga Adnrew.” Here, in
mock New Testament terms and form,
Montgomery’s fantasies the future
great Asian leader, no less take full
flight. An example:
Comment: “Wilson Hall. A hall
specially built to house a huge organ.
Thought to be built in honor of a
British Prime Minister of those days
who supported the 2nd Anti-
Communist Crusade.”
Baker, and this is no mean feat,
manages to keep three more sections
sparking after the pyrotechnics of
Section 5, including, in the final part,
a most ingenious dialogue, which I
shall leave readers of this clever and
moving little book to discover.

Inaugural Exhibition. Central Street
Gallery, Sydney.
THE YEAR usually ends with a rather
commercial whimper, but this time there
is something of a bang with the new,
lofty, white walls, and wooden struts
and beams of Central Street’s downstairs
room where the new abstractionists revel
in the spatial freedom, and at Komon’s
with a formidable group of mainly
expressive abstractionists and realists.
The Central Street scene is domin-
ated by three excellent works by Noel
Dunn, Tony McGillick, and Gunter
Christmann. Dunn’s Three Off of
L-shaped girders, thrusting across the
floor, turning on itself at right-angles,
and suddenly leaping up, is in such a
shade of sweet-sour green that the
shadows it can cast on itself give it
speed, pause, and weightlessness akin to
that in McGillick’s Fontanel of six
modules each of an isosceles triangle
with the two base points sheered off; it
defies its static modular repetition and
leaps to the left at the top, leaving
behind a hollow rectangle that reveals
the wall. Lest it look too dynamic, the
bottom modules are in soft colors, and
to ease the emphasis on the empty
rectangle, the wall cuts in on the piece
in two small triangles. It, like
Christmann’s Seeblick 2, is typical of
the new restlessness in recent abstraction:
Seeblick 2 has an Indian-red triangle
supporting a tall oblong with a band
of purple, sharp green, and dark blue,
cut, as it were, from the heavens; it
seems to sink into the earthy red, but
the bar of green gently and insistently
pulls it back.
If this trio seeks unconfined shapes,
Noritis cleaves to a Yin-Yang symmetry
in an over-cautious Monday, and Joe
Szabo relies over much on a lone triangle
of dulled orange to anchor and animate
his scattered shapes which could be
allowed to escape. Others are rather
concerned with abstraction as comple-
tion tests: John White, who does it with
verve, in Inacircle, has white and blue-
green bands sweeping into the centre to
form two circles, the blue disc in one
wanting to move into the blank white of
the other; Schlicht’s Bishop’s Whole
Length compels us to test constantly

the bottom cross against the shape of
the top one, and we feel involved more
in a jig-saw puzzle than in a visual
adventure. That the repetition and sym-
metry in such works need not imply
stillness is quite apparent in the gentle
rhythms in the delicate, pale, and subtly
balanced Abalone by Wendy Paramor
(a Transfield reject), in the sudden
sharp-toothed bite of Alan Oldfield’s
repeated squares with scalloped sides,
and above all in the thrust and pull of
James Doolin’s Artificial Landscape
which is symmetrical severity epitom-
ised. Young lan Milliss one to watch
is achieving his delight in slight dis-
order by breaking the rules with uneven
edges and painterly surfaces.
If Central Street hails the new values,
Komon’s restates local eternal verities,
but Robertson-Swann’s rather mechani-
cal and dully colored new-sculpture
piece, Judy Cassab’s gently modulated
bands, Senberg’s fine venture into the
stark and unadorned, and William
Wright’s surprising integration of black
and red flat forms, as positive as
machines, with organic areas as crisp
and delicate as green lettuce leaves,
break the devotion to Pugh’s fuzzy
galahs, Shepherdson’s myth- and mist-
shrouded bull, Molvig’s target and bones
(another Transfield reject), that sump-
tuous, associative, heraldic abstraction
of Len French, whose Coming of the
Turtle with a cool central disc balanced
at each end with glowing hemispheres is
glorious, and those tortured, squiggly
trees by Fred Williams. The trees
scatter, accumulate, and pour fear into
a frontal depression to show how the
oddity of our landscape disrupts the
oriental serenity and placement that
Williams clearly reveres.
One of the most formidable works
demanding long contemplation is
Kemp’s Crusade, shattered with shards
of grey, blue, and ochre and reaching
momentary climaxes in rough squares
of red, crimson, yellow, and tan. Praised
by critics as different as Alan McCul-
loch and Patrick McCaughey, Kemp
had this work heaved out of the Trans-
field, as was Sibley’s two people melting
in flaccid pink flesh on sour green, and
Orban’s maze of grooved contours on
silver and gold. This makes 13 rejects
that have now been shown in Sydney;
surely artists are not losing their respect
for critics and judges?
There are other fine works here:
Blackman makes whispy gay colors sad,
Eric Smith Bonnardises a portrait of
Len French, and Fairweather weaves his
secretive, linear tales; there is, too, a
tentative new John Olsen, a little Klee-
like, a little like a more lyrical and
diaphanous Jack Smith and obviously
such a transitional, work that one senses
that Olsen’s lush brush and tigerish
immediacy will not be long in abey-
ance.
Not too much tigerishness or formal
calculation at the Macquarie Galleries’
delectable Christmas offerings, but there
is plenty of uninsistent delight and a
1946 Herman that subdues the outback
and indicates what a revolution has
occurred in the past 20 years.


THE LAND
A merrier Christmas on the rural front
THIS LOOKS LIKE being a merrier
Christmas for the Minister of Primary
Industry, “Doug” Anthony, than he
had reason to expect a few months ago,
when nothing seem,ed to be going right
on the rural front politically or
otherwise. Perhaps his most pleasing
seasonal gift was the prospect of selling
200,000 tons of wheat to Japan this
year, following the Japanese invitation
to tender for the supply of that quantity
in part substitution of wheat from the
United States. The order is not yet in

disposal. problems for the bumper
harvest (extended at 435 million

bushels) expected this season. The
Japanese gesture is all the more wel-
come coming at a time when a cloud
hangs over this year’s sales to main-
land China and the world price of
wheat is hovering around the minimum
set by the International Wheat Agree-
ment. A firm Japanese order for 200,000
tons would be mighty pleasing to every-
body in the industry, and not least to
Mr. Anthony, after the tortuous business
of getting first the AWF and then the
dissident State of Victoria to accept the
Government’s new style “two-price”
Wheat Stabilisation Agreement.
Price could be the burning question
in a Japanese wheat deal for such a
big quantity, because wheat is a buyers’
market at the moment. Other problems,
such as storage capacity for surplus
wheat, could well arise for the industry
in the New Year, but, by and large,
the wheat coast looks a lot clearer than
most people would have thought it
by Christmas. This also goes for wool.
Going on the majorities for a statutory
authority to run the all but cut-and-
dried wool marketing corporation at
the AWIC’s first two meetings on the
subject, the Minister was entitled to
think a battle was brewing to get the
Government to swallow its aversion to
such an authority being set up (some-
thing that the dried fruits industry had
singularly failed to get Mr. Anthony
to do in its case). He needn’t have
worried, of course, because the play
behind the scenes was all. in favor of
trying out a non-statutory body for
three years. When it came to the third
vote (in Melbourne), the Government
was seen to be well off the statutory
hook.
The Government approval for the
marketing corporation seems now to
be a mere formality. The board is
expected to be chosen by the end of
March, and the machinery itself should
be set to go well in time for next
August’s opening auctions. Admittedly,
the selling brokers haven’t got all they
wanted, especially in board representa-
tion, but their other grievances have
mostly been met, and others, being
mainly technical, won’t hold up the
scheme’s implementation. On present
indications, about two-fifths of Aus-
tralia’s wool clip will be involved, that
is, of small lots to be bulked into
parcels of four for auction where the
corporation would exercise its powers
of offering (through selling brokers),
withdrawal, or withholding at its dis-
cretion. Some people in the industry
have the idea that if the three-year
trial run proves a success handling
parcels of up to four, it could be
extended to cover the whole clip.
Similar to the wheat stabilisation
arrangement, woolgrowers are expected
to get a first advance payment,
envisaged as about 60 percent of the
estimated vsilue of their consignments
on arrival at store for all lots desig-
nated to certain sections of the cata-
logue. The final payment would be
made, say, six months later, to be
arrived at on the basis of recorded
type and yield and on the State
average prices for the particular grade.
Although some growers think the extra
charges involved will outweigh the
scheme’s benefits to them, this is not
Mr. Anthony’s worry (he’s a dairy
farmer, anyway).
Indeed, he still has many anxious
moments ahead of him on the score of
the dairying industry in general,
though one of the worries here could
be eased if Mr. McMahon’s hint before
the recess that the Government is
looking into the possibility of extending
the period for compensating sterling
devaluation losses is carried out. Apart
from that, Mr. Anthony is still having
a hard job to get the State Govern-
ments to agree to implement .his dairy-
ing industry rationalisation scheme
(the whole thing depends on them now
that the money has been arranged. by
the Federal Government). In the
interim, the beggars’ chorus (led by
the VTU) chanting higher dairying
subsidies seems to have swung over to
Christmas carols (now that no Parlia-
ments are sitting), as have Tasmanian
vegetable growers who have not been
all that placated by the sweet reason-
ableness of the Australia-N.Z. inter-
government conference on their
grievances about N.Z. competition re-
inforced by the devalued dollar.
When in Parliament recently he said
imports of N.Z. lamb comprised only
half of one percent of Australian
market supplies of the animal, Mr.
Anthony gave the lie to the recent beefs
of local producers on this subject.
Indeed the meat industry as a whole
is ending the year on a more hopeful
note than that struck when exports of
beef to the United States were sus-
pended three months ago.
The Minister can be equally happy
about beef now that shipments have
resumed to the United States (not to
arrive before January 1, though) and
on his estimates we should export
higher quantities next year than this
one to the U.S. He thinks the U.S. is
likely to increase its global beef import
quota by five percent in 1969. How-
ever, if Mr. Anthony has cause for
satisfaction in this prospect, the
industry is not all that happy, because
producers now have to earn an entitle-
ment to export beef to the United
States by showing the Meat Board
tangible results of their efforts to find
alternative markets. The latter are not
so easy to find and the efforts are cost-
ing money.

FIRE CONTROL IN W.A.
SHORT OF TRAINING, amply
equipping, and keeping on standby-
alert during the whole fire season
practically every other able-bodied man
in the country, there seems to be no
way of guaranteeing complete control
over bushfires. For the foreseeable
future we must resign ourselves to
their occurrence. However, their con-
sequences need not be as severe as
they have often been over recent
decades. Forestry experts believe that,
as we have improved our fire control
and lessened the number of outbreaks,
the fires that get away are more des-
tructive than they ever were. There
are two reasons for this: closer settle-
ment has put more numerous and
more valuable constructions in places

vegetation generally has appreciated.
Constructional timber has become one
of our scarcest resources and most
people now ascribe aesthetic value to
the natural bushland which our
pioneering ancestors regarded nega-
tively.
The second reason arises directly
from the traditional policy which
requires each and every fire to be
extinguished as soon as possible after
it starts. This program, implemented
with increasing efficiency, has resulted
in a large build-up of litter throughout
extensive areas of bush and forest. Thus,
with plenty of fuel to feed it, a fire
that gets away can go really wild under
favorable conditions and form a verit-
able fire-storm, such as happened
recently around Sydney. It is common
knowledge that an area of bush once
burned will not carry a heavy fire
again for several years until a deep
litter has accumulated. Foresters point
out that before European settlement
fires were far more frequent than they
are today, but that they were also far
less intense.
Indeed, Captain Cook described Aus-
tralia as a smoky country. Some botan-
ists believe that many of our eucalypts
and other native species acquired their
well-known resistance to fire because
they evolved in a fiery environment.
Certainly, some of our important forests
are now declining for the very reason
that they have not been subjected to.
the purifying flames for over half a
century. On this account, the less valu-
able, fire-susceptible vegetation has
crept in and is choking the growth of
the original trees. Their growth is also
being retarded because of the formation
of the thick carpet of litter. This
material contains much of the plant
food, and the nutrients in it are not
being freed to re-cycle through the soil
and trees. In the dry Australian
environment, fire is the natural agent
for breaking down this litter and releas-
ing its minerals. This job is done by
moulds and the other processes of decay
in the moister countries.
Realising that fire is not invariably
bad, the foresters of Western Australia
have started a revolutionary approach
to fire control and forest management,
which they have been testing for the
past two or three seasons. During
autumn and spring they have been
deliberately setting the forests on fire
to burn up the accumulated litter so
that wild, uncontrollable fires cannot
develop in summer. This protective
burning is being carried out on a large
scale. Aircraft are employed to traverse
areas of up to 15 square miles at a time,
dropping tiny incendiary bombs. The
flight pattern and rate of drop is such
that a fire is kindled in every five-acre
block within a few minutes of each
other. The flights start about noon on
a day when the weather is favorable.
With this basic plan and taking what-
ever other precautions are appropriate
for each situation, dangerous “blow-up”
fires have been successfully avoided,
and the flames, licking 2ft. to 3ft. high
as a rule, travel slowly through the

forest until they reach the patch burnt
by the neighboring fire, and die out
before evening.
Between 60 and 90 percent of the
litter is consumed, which has usually
amounted to three to five tons per
acre. The heat released over the entire
area is rather more than three times
the amount being received from the
sun’s radiation. Nevertheless, damage to
the living understory is very small,
and the larger trees are quite unaffected.
Even the wildlife, including the insects,
come to no harm, and some species, in
fact, seem to thrive better after the
fires. These burn-offs will not need to
be repeated every year. Depending on
the type of forest, once every five years
should be often enough. Last year, over
half a million acres were protectively
burned at a cost of about 10 cents per
acre, or 2 cents if amortised over the
five years. One aeroplane can sweep
ten to 15 thousand square miles in an
afternoon, and so whole regions could
be covered by the one team in a season.
A strategic plan could create buffer
zones, and by this means wild-fire
control could be extended over even
vaster areas.
In the application of this seemingly
improbable method of preventing des-
tructive bushfires, the Western Austra-
lians have some advantages. Their
jarrah and karri trees are notoriously
fire-resistant, and the forests are mainly
on gently undulating terrain. In the
eastern States the forest country is
usually very rugged. Fires travel quickly
up steep slopes, and could leap into
the tree crowns to become the classical
infernos. However, by adopting more
complex flight plans than the simple
grid used in the West, and bombing the
ridges first before proceeding down the
slopes along the contour, this risk
should be obviated. Papers published
in the latest “Australian Journal of
Botany,” by A. M. Gill and D. H.
Ashton, of the University of Melbourne,
and R. G. Vines, of the CSIRO, indi-
cate that some of the major species of
eastern eucalypts, and even pine trees,
are sufficiently fire-resistant to with-
stand the kind of controlled burning
carried out in the West. The Victorian
experiments included species with barks
of the gum, box, and stringy types.
Even the fibrous-bark species came out
well in both the laboratory and field
tests. Vines feels sufficiently confident
to sum up by writing: “. . . it is evident
that control burning, properly executed,
and with due regard to tree type, does
not constitute a threat to forest survival.
Small trees can withstand the effects of
mild burns when fire intensities are
low (thermal outputs of less than 100
Btu/ft./sec.); however, even big trees
will perish in fierce and uncontrolled
blazes, in which intensities may rise to
values of the order of 10,000 Btu/ft./
sec. A major achievement of control
burning is that it prevents the develop-
ment of these devastating wild-fires.”
Another major achievement will be
when the people living in the bush
around the big cities consent to this
means of protection.

N.Z.-South African sport
In reply to Mr. J. M. Taylor (8., Nov-
ember 30) all splinters in the log of
opinion are not with him on the basis
of public stands so far taken on the
All Black tour issue. i
The Citizens’ Association for Racial
Equality (CARE) is opposed to the
tour on the grounds that there is no
assurance, in spite of repeated requests,
that members of different ethnic groups
be admitted into South Africa as spec-
tators of matches.
Mr. J. M. Booth, secretary of the
N.Z. Maori Council, advises that the
official opinion of the Council is about
to be formalised, but that their opinion
is probably that the tour should go
ahead with Maoris in it, their reasoning
being that it is a good idea to maintain
relations and keep the door open.
Two of the four Maori MPs, Mat
Rata and Whetu Tirakatene-Sullivan,
have opposed the tour. Rata says he
consistently opposes apartheid, not only
because it becomes an issue with Rugby,
He opposes any sport links with South
Africa under existing conditions for
sport.
Whetjs Tiraketene-Sullivan: “Until
the Springbok team is chosen from the
best sportsmen in South Africa rather
than from an all-white apartheid group,
then I am opposed to N.Z. participating
in representative sporting fixtures with
South Africa.
The list carries on—the Unions, the
Churches, prominent individuals, each
with their statements evidencing that
N.Z. is divided —the matter just has
not the same intensity of support yet
that it had in 1960.

Fire insurance
Several of the comments in your
article “Why a $3 million fire barely
rated a mention” (8., December 7) are
inaccurate and misleading. Firstly, the
premium income figures you quote for
Fire and Householders’ Insurance
business are gross figures, as the
Commonwealth Statistician takes pains
to point out at the foot of each page
of the publication from which your
figures were taken. The “earned”
premium income for the year, which
is the figure that counts, was $88.7
million for Fire Insurance and $39.9
million for Householders’ Insurance.
Not only have quite considerable
Taxation, Commission, Fire Brigade,
and Administrative costs to be added
to claims but a healthy sum
should remain to establish reserves for
such disasters as the Townsville Sugar
Terminal fire, the Killarney (Queens-
land) disaster, the Adelaide and Mec-
kering earthquakes, the Mosman
cyclone, and the N.S.W. bushfires,
not to mention the Tasmanian bush-
fires which, incidentally, wiped out
50 years of underwriting profit for all
insurance companies combined in
Tasmania. Fire insurance in Australia
is no bonanza and a $3 million loss in
a single fire is a serious matter.
Secondly, it is sheer nonsense to say
that underwriters do not use selective
sanction in their premium rating of
commercial and industrial premises.
Penalising for bad risks and rewarding
for good protected risks is the very
basis of Fire Underwriting and the
Australian insurance market as a
whole is well practised in this regard.
Thirdly, each Fire and Accident
Underwriters’ Association in each
State of Australia has its own survey
staff, and the total would be nearer
100 than the 20 you quote. These
experts have a world-wide exchange of
fire-protection knowledge with similar
bodies overseas and they are able to
give sound advice not only on fire
protection but on safe * building
materials. Additionally each association
supplies a first-class inspection service
of sprinklered risks. In fact, automatic
sprinklers must be installed in keeping
with certain rules and regulations laid
down by the Underwriters’ Associations.
Apart from the question of accuracy,
the purpose of your article would have
been better served if you had drawn
attention to the urgent need for top
management to make fire protection
a prime executive responsibility, and
not be something left, as it so often
is, to somebody way down the line.

Dutton's "Andy"
Your correspondent M. M. Taylor (B. r
November 9) correctly describes Geof-
frey Dutton’s “Andy” as a total loss.
This novel in no way captures the
mood of the RAAF serviceman, nor
does it evoke the rich humor and
tragedy of Service life. Might I recom-
mend to Mr. Taylor the Australian
novel “Nobody Dies But Me,” by
Geoffrey Mill. Set in the RAAF, this
novel, in about half the words of
“Andy,” really gets to the very core of
Service life. Hilarious and tragic, it has
rightly been described by one reviewer
as a major achievement in Australian
literature.
Neal Bradley
Hunters Hill, N.S.W.
Geoffrey Dutton’s “Andy” probably
failed to contain “the dry wit of the
Aussie serviceman” because it never
existed. Not in my experience, anyway.
What little wit Aussies have is still
bullocky’s wit, loud and offensive, and
mostly one six-letter word.
