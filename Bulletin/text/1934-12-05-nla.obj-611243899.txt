HIS BOOKS
The Week’s Best: —
NEW
AUSTRALIAN
FICTION
Five years ago
the publication
within one week
of three Austra-
lian books worthy
of the London
market might have created a sensation.
It is becoming commonplace. The Bul-
letin has received three this week which
in material and writing could just as
well have come out of London or New
York as out of Australia.
The first of them is Ernest Wells’s
Brave Music (Angus and Robertson ; 65.).
If it fails to achieve greatness it is merely
because Wells has tried to paint a very
large canvas with a small brush and un-
matured experience. In 10 years’ time
he may be able to tackle eras, but at
present his pen is more suited to episodes,
and his attempt
to pack with his-
tory a 333-pag©
tale which begins
with a mid-Vic-
torian murder in
Wapping and
ends with the
Great War pro-
duces disjointed
effects.
Moreover, he
has not achieved
detachment from
hi s characters,
and there is a
slightly ludicrous
p r o p a g andist
note about his
descriptions of
Australian indus-
trial disputes and
their personali-
ties.
His Melbourne
strike, for in-
Ernest Wells
stance, sounds as if it were being de-
scribed by some foreigner who had seen
a French revolution. And his colonel on
parade—“his booted feet wide spread....
a bullock of a man, popular with the
troops”—who adjured the ranks to “fire
low and lay them out” would sound un-
real anywhere outside the pages of the
“Boys’ Own Annual”:
Phough. The Colonel spat and, smack-
ing his white gloves on his scarlet-seamed
thigh, swung into his creaking saddle.
With all its imperfections, however,
Brave Music is a book to read.
And Vance Palmer’s Swayne Family
(Angus and Robertson; 65.), which
halved the. first prize in the Melbourne
centenary competition, is eminently so.
It is all of a piece. Its characterisation is
good. Melbourne readers will recognise
its types, which are so common that no
two guesses will identify the same
originals.
In every way The Swayne Family is an
advance on most social novels published
in Australia ; and if the critic feels that
Palmer owes a deep debt to John Gals-
worthy, who popularised the dynastic
type of fiction, Palmer is, at any rate,
in good company. Hergesheimer, Mazo
de la Roche, Henry Handel Richardson
have all learned before him that the dy-
nastic method assures those who can
handle it interminable material without
the trouble of thinking out new plots.
Indeed, the skilled exponent soon dis-
covers that a plot isn’t really needed at
all.
All that is needed is a family and the
current issues of the “Argus” and the
“Economic Record.” Any old family will
do so long as it is reasonably opulent and
miserable.
Mr. Palmer’s menage is of the sort
found in the region of Walsh-street,
South Yarra. It has plenty of first-gen-
eration brothers in it. They are indis-
pensable to the Forsytian method. There
is the man-of-the-world pastoral Swayne
—a combination of old Jolyon and the
sporty Forsytes—who owns a station
called Niva Downs in the Riverina
(where there aren’t any downs); the archi-
tect Hugh, a whale for Spanish bungalows
and vegetarianism ; the opulent but radi-
cal Willie, who owns a profitable print-
ery and parted with the rest of the family
on the conscription issue ; and the thinly
Soames-like importer, Digby, whose
household —second wife and two sons
and two daughters —forms the central
theme of the book.
This old gentleman progresses to de-
struction in the approved Russian manner
as applied to modern Australian life. He
is discovered at a ship’s rail, returned
after visiting his son’s grave in Europe
and having a stroke in Lausanne. He is
gazing “with doubtful eyes” at a “greasy
tug with a few nondescript buildings
huddled round a stretch of stale water,”
which any Melburnian will recognise as
the Yarra Basin.
From then onwards he merely goes on
gazing (while inwardly bemoaning
his lack of contact with his family) at his
surroundings or his brothers or the stock-
market or his sons’ failure to be dynastic ;
and little more is required of him except
to have another stroke at an appropriate
moment and leave the stage clear.
The rest of the family is carefully con-
structed to show all the facets of Austra-
lian life. Culture is represented by Kath-
leen, a young lady who thinks she wants
to be a Doctor of Philosophy, talks about
Baudelaire and
runs off to
marry an illegi-
timate fruit-
farmer —a firm,
forthright per-
son. There is
Ernest, the car-
toonist, to re-
present art and
speak the jar-
go n of the
Upper Bourke-
street cafes
rather uncon-
vincingly. There
is the flapper,
Dorothy, who
marries the re-
served young
E n g I i shman.
And there is
Vance Palmer
a cricket match —as essential to Austra-
lian social fiction as the young English-
man —in which George, the son who is
not successful at the Bar, makes 93 as a
prelude to being sandbagged by a rival
for a shopgirl’s hand and nearly killed
in a motor accident. Of course, also,
there is the portrait of the son killed at
the war at which old Digby can gaze
when he is tired of other forms of being
wretched.
This representative cast combine to
hold introspective conversations about
their discontents, with excursions into ele-
mentary philosophy and economic
nationalism. When other things pall,
nature supplies variety:
Such a wonder of green days, such
shimmering of feather-soft foliage in the
streets the air seemed tremulous with
birds finding voice and buds bursting
their filmy sheaths....
Any competent author, well read in
his Saga, can do that sort of thing by
the page and, just as easily as Mr.
Palmer, introduce Uncle Anthony with a
tip on a horse or an offer of a drink.
But Spinifex and Sand (Shakespeare
Head ; 65.), a collection of short stories,
proves that Palmer can do other things
as well. This is an Australian book in
the true sense. Its 18 sketches range over
a vast field of characteristic matter
scarcely yet prospected by Australian
genius. Who reads “The Little Duck,”
“Monday Morning” and “The Rainbow
Bird” will be inclined to place Mr.
Palmer in the front rank of short-story
writers. Katherine Mansfield rarely did
anything better.
M. H. E.
A Poet
Is Made
Should not the
potential Austra-
lian poet, like the
sculptor or
painter, undergo
an intensive
training under a master in the fundamen-
tal principles and technique of his art‘>
A poetic academy or school would
cast out the inefficient, direct the half-
talented to commercial occupations, and
send out the real artist confident to de-
velop his gift on individual lines.
An early culling would bring an
economic gain. Most of our “poets”
are but descriptive versifiers whose amaz-
ing vocabulary of words denoting color
could be profitably employed in trade
publicity. Of those endowed with true
poetic insight few can show us their
vision. Lacking surety of guidance as
to the essentials of poetry, they distort
the picture by experimental focusing
and blur it by inartistic technique.
These thoughts are provoked by a
reading of the prize centenary poem:
“An Ode to Melbourne and Memory,”
by Furnley Maurice.
This poet sees objects as a painter sees
them. In a series of pictures he tries
to reveal the beauty of Melbourne—new
and old, real and visionary—under the
influence of “sourceless light,” “kindly
light,” “changing light,” “unearthly
glow.” The ode is in four parts, with
frequent changes of metre. The poet
looks upon the city towers at evening
under a cloudy moon. The buildings
tremble in a golden haze which ethereal-
ises them. Built for commerce, they
have blossomed into beauty unaware.
He pierces the veil of sense, and reveals
a deeper beauty. The towers become
“symbols of the spirit’s vaster plan.” He
contrasts the infant village and the
modern city. He recalls vanished
familiar things, and weighs the loss and
gain. He turns to the beauty created
by the artistry of a newer, richer Mel-
bourne—the gardens, the bridge reflec-
tions, the flash of light on the seagulls’
wings. Though the material city changes,
what has been will remain. Beauty is
eternal.
The conception suggests Keats; the
execution a misty Yeats and a robust
Bellerive.
The central thought is beauty; but,
lacking constructive balance and har-
mony, the completed poem does not
leave with us an abiding sense of beauty.
It might have been written in a crescendo
of dignity, like Arnold’s “Church of
Brou.” Instead, for two cantos it
mounts, though with harshly whirring
wing, almost into the empyrean; then

Every day dozens of serious accidents are explained
by the regretful words, "I couldn't stop in time!"
But here's a close-up of an incident that, a split-
second later, would have been an accident —but the
"G-3" tyres stopped the car as soon as the
brakes stopped the wheels!
And it's a dead-sure, safe, short stop no skid or
slither possible, as the All-Weather tread grips and
holds the road with the full force of the brakes!
Because of its greater number of those sharp-edged,
all-angle diamond blocks in the centre of the tread
. . . because its flatter, wider tread gives you a
wider grip on the road ... the "G-3" affords you,
in the fullest measure yet, the Goodyear Margin of
Safety!
Skidding is the greatest accident risk; insurance
records prove it I I times more dangerous than either
punctures or blowouts. See your Goodyear Dealer
about a full set of ~G -3, 5 ". Their extra margin of
safety costs you nothing extra!
BRIEFLY HERE'S WHAT THE NEW "G-3" MEANS TO YOU
• SAFETY More non-skid blocks.
• SMOOTHNESS Wider riding
ribs.
• SAFETY—Flatter, wider, thicker
tread.
• MILEAGE—Pounds more rubber
in the tread.
• MILEAGE Supertwist Cord

crashes to the commonplace; feebly
rises ; circles aimlessly over very familiar
ground, and ceases its inconclusive flight.
In “Memory” we have this quatrain:
Old houses with ringed horse-poles and
the chains,
The sky-deep puddles and torrential
drains;
But Whelan wrecked the years of strange
content
When old Miss Burton's bluestone cot-
tage went.
No form of art is static —a modern may
not write like Beowulf —but is this
poetry? If so, “some exquisite loss still
lingers” (F.M.) for the divine ecstacy
of the bygone Muse. Bewildered, we
turn back and re-read:
There is a sun beyond your spires that’s
like no other sun.
We had thought that it referred to “the
light that never was on sea or land” ;
now we fear it is only a compliment to
Australian sunshine.
' Further, the poem is marred by the
obtrusion of harsh and inartistic images.
But, the poet will tell us, anything may
be used as the subject of art. Quite so ;
but only under the hand of a master
who can sublimate the ugly things and
bring them into harmony with the pic-
ture, and so enrich it.
Compare
A maiden moon which sparkles on a sty,
Glorifying clown and satyr
with this stanza of F. Maurice:
Maybe the coral of the Barrier Reef,
In spite of time and thrashing storms
and the filth of shags,
Could raise in blind compulsion, without
knowledge or belief,
A pearly lighthouse over its own hull-
tearing crags!
The former, though dealing only with
the surface of things, satisfies our artis-
tic perceptions ; the latter, which reaches
out to the intangible, leaves with us
ugliness and not a vision of pearl.
Melody is an essential element of true
poetry. The hissing sibilants and the
neglect of consonantal assonance detract
from the beauty of this ode to beauty.
The ear and the intellect of the poet need
rigorous training in the music and mean-
ing of words. Two inheritors of the
bardic tradition —Shaw Neilson {“And
long-winged swallows unafraid return-
ing”) and Victor Daley (“ Singing his
Iliad on a blade of grass”) —can in one
line project a vivid picture and stir our
imagination ; whereas most of our poets,
in half a dozen stanzas, with a wealth of
descriptive adjectives each cushioning its
noun, two or three to a line, leave us un-
moved.
“But,” cry the scandalised critics of
societies which “encourage literature”
by praise and dispraise of work already
published, “an academy would stifle the
divine flame and produced mechanised
poetry. ‘A poet is born.’ ” Is the poet
alone born full-panoplied? Were Melba,
Percy Grainger, Lambert and Streeton
self-taught artists? And was there not
a man named Archibald who made
Henry Lawson articulate?

A Choice of Verse:—
FOR A CRITIC.
A spring song, or an epic, as you will,
You ta\e, and say, "A Sha\speare come anew”
Nor see your poet burn in shame for you.
You say it cheering, when one see\s to spill
A splendor on a thought until it ring
Loudly or clearly for the sweet word’s sake.
He does not dream that foolish lips mistake
The small true gift for echo of the king.
A "second Sha\speare,” say you? True, he comes
In passionate flame from his high plane afar,
But yet the pigmy poets as they run
Have also found their audience, with wise thumbs
For up—or down ! The farthest, faintest star
To some unvisioned planet may be sun.

ETHEL DAVIES.
Jaundice
and
Jar dine
D. R. Jardine
demonstrates in
Ashes and Dust
(Hutchinson ; 65.)
his great ability
as a cricket
strategist and Test-match critic. His
book is likely to become the stan-
dard of reference concerning the
Tests of the 1934 tour. Each match
is reviewed with shrewd insight and
acid criticism. Herein lies Jardine’s
weakness ; there is an
overplus of . acidity ;
moreover, he cannot
forget that the cricket
world has accepted
Woodfull’s cricket
ideals and not Jar-
dine’s.
In his opening chap-
ter he discusses “The
Victors and the Van-
quished.” Concerning
the victors, the consen-
sus of opinion would
suggest that Bradman,
Ponsford, Grimmett
and O’Reilly were the
key-men of the 1934
team. Jardine rightly
adds McCabe. In
fact, to many of us
McCabe was the key-man of the
team ; at least, in the first and second
Tests. On other members of the team
Jardine comments shrewdly, and he
trenchantly-criticises the English selec-
tors.
The contentious matter in the book
concerning the Board of Control, Lar-
wood and barracking illustrates Jardine’s
unhappy flair for rubbing every ofie up
the wrong way. Having exhausted all
there is to be said concerning the Board
of Control’s leniency towards the Aus-
tralian barracker, he selects M. A. Noble
for castigation. Noble knows all about
barracking, for there is no cricketer liv-
ing or dead who has been subjected
to more hostile treatment in this respect
than “Mary Ann.”
Let us suppose that Jardine is batting
on the Sydney Cricket Ground. The
trend of the game does not call for run-
making and victory,
but for ability to stay
at wickets and so
save the game. No
present-day batsman is
more qualified to fill
the role than Jardine,
and in that respect he
resembles Noble. Im-
agine the howling ipf
lardine and his sup-
porters if some hun-
dreds of “Hillites,”
oblivious of the fight-
ing spirit displayed,
were to commence
chanting “The Dead
March.” This is pre-
cisely what happened
to Noble, not in Syd-
ney, not in Melbourne,
but in England, at
Manchester in 1899,
when, with his back to
the wall, Noble defied
the English attack for
eight and three-quarter
hours and saved the
game for Australia.
At Manchester again,
in 1921, Collins on
a wicket made to order for Parkin
batted for four hours and fifty minutes
for 40 runs, and again Australia was
saved from defeat. Parkin eventually
got Collins l.b.w. on an extremely doubt-
ful decision. The story of this remark-
able innings is told by Richard Binns in
an anthology of cricket stories, edited
by Howard Marshall. Binns pays a great
tribute to Collins, and it is to be hoped
that he knew nothing of the sequel to
the achievement which I had from Col-
lins himself. In the dressing-room at
the conclusion of his innings, Collins was
warned concerning the probable action of
a section of the barrackers collected at the
gate. No purpose would be served by
giving further details, but it’s safe to
say that no such warning would be
necessary in any city in Australia.
Barracking has been described as “an
unnecessary evil.” There is no doubt
that it has caused many regrettable inci-
dents. When concerted action is decided
on by a number of spectators suppres-
sion is an impossibility. Such spontane-
Jardine:
an abovethebodyline caricature
by Aria.
ous ebullitions are usu-
ally caused becaus
a section of the
crowd imagines a
grievance. The bottle-
throwing stunt put over
during Warner’s first
visit to Australia is a
case in point. It is
possible, however, to
suppress the individual
barracker who becomes
offensive. What escapes
Jardine is the fact that
Noble, whilst deplor-
ing certain features
connected with the sub-
ject, realises the value
of barracking as a test
of temperament or
“guts” for the cricketer
concerned. If he cannot stand up to the
remarks of the crowd, whether hostile
or otherwise, he is not likely to shine
in a crisis, and one of the reasons why
Australian representative cricketers are
at their best in taut situations is due to
the “salting” given them by Australian
crowds.
Jardine has complained that the
witticisms of the “hill-ites” were, to him,
non-existent. Well, most cricketers ap-
pearing on the Sydney Cricket Ground
are nicknamed. Jardine wrote his own
ticket —it was “Sardine.” Pataudi was
christened “Potato.” It happened that
the pair of them walked out to bat to-
gether. They took their time. One im-
patient enthusiast called out “Come on,
Fish and Chips, get a move on!” Verity
had a habit of changing from over to
round the wicket, each change necessi-
tating the shifting of the sight-board
and the continual raising of umpire Ber-
wick’s hand as a guide to the batsman.
A voice boomed over the arena: “It’s
no use, Borrick; Woody won’t let you
leave the room till playtime.”
On one occasion it took Johnny Doug-
las 20 minutes to hit a ball past the
bowler for a run. There was a breath-
less silence, and then a surprised voice
burst forth, “My God—it’s alive!”
It is rumored that Jardine intends to
settle in Tanganyika. Edgar Wallace once
wrote that the natives in those parts pos-
sessed a keen sense of humor. Perhaps
Jardine will catch the complaint—a
cricketer needs to.
GEORGE GARNSEY
A Satchel of Books
Great Short Stories of Detection, Mys-
tery and Horror (Gollancz; Bs. 6d.).
Dorothy L. Sayers is responsible for this
immense collection. (There are about
70 stories, and the book runs to over a
thousand pages.) All the British masters
of the macabre —H. G. Wells, W. W.
Jacobs, Lord Dunsany, Sir Arthur Quiller-
Couch —are represented; also many
writers whose names are unfamiliar to this
critic. The average reader will turn first
to “Q’s” beautiful “A Pair of Hands,”
renew acquaintance with “The Story of
the Late Mr. Elvesham” and two or
three more classics, and then expect to
be bored. He won’t be. There is liter-
ally not a dull page in the book. Out-
standing gems are R. Austin Freeman’s
“The Echo of a Mutiny” and John Bet-
jeman’s delicious Irish study “Lord Mont
Prospect.”
Kipling’s contribution to this year’s
festive offerings is his Collected Dog
Stories, joyously illustrated by G. L.
Stampa (Macmillan ; Angus and Robert-
son ; 11s. 3d.). Nicely turned out, it
suggests the ideal gift for one suspected
of any liking at all for dogs, various ter-
riers in particular.
Philip Allan has added to the Nautilus
Library—as fine an inexpensive catering
for tastes of sea-literature readers as can
be had—Geoffrey Rawson’s Bligh of the
Bounty, and a new publication, The Sea
Apprentice: Being an Account of Two
Voyages Round the World Under Can-
vas. Small, handy and well-turned-out
books.
Parker Pyne Investigates, by Agatha
Christie (Collins; 7s. 6d.). A dozen
short stories in each of which Mr. Pyne,
who is a blend of Sherlock Holmes and
one of the Cheeryble brothers, figures as
deus ex machina. His benevolent ac-
tivities range from London to Bagdad,
almost every type of malefactor is frus-
trated, and nearly all the episodes are
plausible.
The Book of Speed (Batsford ; Angus
and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.). Authoritative
articles by Malcolm Campbell, G. de
Havilland, Stephen King-Hall, Flight-Lt.
Stainforth and various other experts in
all spheres of speed-seeking and -achiev-
ing, illustrated with scores of fine pic-
tures. The air sections, though every
flight cancels such things out to some
extent, are recent enough to be almost
news, and the book all round is so well
balanced as to have appeal for the
specialist and general reader alike.
Especially good also for the inquiring
boy of late school age.
Great Lovers, by S. Elliott Napier
(Angus and Robertson; 65.). One of
the best of the dozens of re-tellings
of striking love stories from history.
Most tellers of these pretty tales eke
out a scant knowledge with matter that
has little to do with the business at hand.
Napier retails only the couple of dozen
best of the hundreds of possible histori-
cal love stories, and thus has plenty of
material for good narrative accounts
without resort to padding. Most of his
versions were first printed in the “Aus-
tralian Woman’s Mirror.”
The Pearls of Pilolu, by Alys Brown
(Eldon Press ; 7s. 6d.). Another “Aus-
tralian Woman’s Mirror” serial to be
done as a book, this is a brightly-written
story of a girl’s adventuring to an island
north of Australia, whither she is fol-
lowed by various crooks who rightly
suspect her father of harboring a for-
tune of pearls.
The Elmslie Mystery, by A. A. Kenny
(Macquarie Head Press ; 65.). A thriller
with country life in M.L. as a back-
ground. The plot is unusual, and there’s
a nice girl to supply the love-interest.
♦
“M.G.”: Bernard Cronini’s criticism
of Adam Lindsay Gordon inspires me
to ask why Gordon made such a ghastly
technical blunder in “How We Beat the
Favorite.” He wrote:
Aye, so ends the tussle —. I knew the
tan muzzle
Was first, though the ringmen were
yelling “Dead-heat!”
Why should the bookmakers have been
anxious to see the favorite win? They
would have had to empty their bags,
assuming they had made a scientific
book. Their interest was the same as
the rider’s—to beat the favorite —a fact
which should have been obvious to a
racing man such as Gordon was.

WHERE FEDERALISM FAILS.
Our Federal system of government,
though swarming with officials (it has
a fish-like capacity for spawning them),
is ill adapted for swift action in emer-
gencies. This has been shown for the
hundredth or thousandth time in the case
of the foolhardy youngsters who set out
for Maoriland in a Puss Moth, without
wireless and with so little room that
“one of the two was practically carried
on the other’s shoulders.” Their wild
intention was well known, and a certi-
ficate was refused. They left without
one.
The Commonwealth authorities, as
they confess, “had no power to seize the
machine.” If the State authorities had
this power, which is doubtful, they did
not try to exercise it. But when the
young shavers reached Maoriland they
were carpeted immediately, and if they
had tried to take off from that country
they would assuredly have been stopped.
There is no conflict of powers or inertia
bred of confusion over there.
The grasshopper invasion furnishes
another case in point. It began in one
State, and, assisted rather than checked
by dilatory and sporadic measures, has
spread to others. Now departments in
four States, each responsible only for
dealing with the scourge within its own
borders, are trying to control it. Efforts
at voluntary co-operation are being
made, for our agricultural scientists are
more energetic than our politicians, and
are free from the provincial jealousies
which divide those worthies; it is re-
corded that a gentleman from the Waite
Research Institute at Adelaide, another
from the Victorian Department of Agri-
culture and a third from the correspond-
ing department at Brisbane have visited
Sydney “to discuss the scope of the cam-
paign and the methods of control adopted
in N. S. Wales, together with points of
mutual interest.” Meanwhile, great loss
has been caused by insects with no re-
spect for lines on the map or the majesty
of State rights.
Countries with unitary systems are
much better equipped for dealing with
such matters than we are. Certainly
they absent themselves from the felicities
of the American features of our Consti-
tution. Maoriland, for instance; has no-
thing like our High Court, “the guardian
of the Federal Constitution and of the
Constitutions of the several States,”
which decided that State railwaymen had
no right to go to the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court to have their wages
fixed, and then reversed its own judg-
ment ; and which has ruled, in effect, that
a State may prohibitively tax motor-
lorries carrying goods from another
State, though Section 92 says:
Trade, commerce and intercourse
among the States, whether by means of
internal carriage or ocean transportation,
shall be absolutely free.
Maoriland, nevertheless, struggles on
without a Court of this description. On
the other hand, Maoriland has no seces-
sion movement. The idea of secession
never occurs to Taranaki or Clutha
people, any more than it occurs to Lan-
cashiremen or Yorkshiremen. Only
under Federalism, seemingly, does dis-
content beget separatism. Be this as it
may, the Westralians were nearly two
to one for secession when they put it to
the vote, and their agitation has sur-
vived the efforts of the Commonwealth
Government to kill it with kindness and
exhortations —grants, commissions and
pamphlets issued from the Government
Printery. There is considerable sym-
pathy with it in other States.
The Westralians, it is conceded, are
living under a system which doesn’t suit
them. Their industry is over-regulated
by two arbitration “shops” and two Par-
liaments, world without end. They have
to pay too many taxes and support too
many members, Ministers, lawyers and
officials. They are subjected to new
forms of oppression with high-sounding
names, such as “transport regulation” ;
petty tyrants are starting up in every
direction to tell them that they mustn’t
do this and they mustn’t do that. And
the distribution of functions is so un-
fair that it is easy for the Common-
wealth to show an annual surplus;
almost impossible for the State. All this
is true, but the Westralians are not the
only sufferers. Their grievances are
shared by people in other parts.
In their hearts the Westralians don't
want to break away from their fellow-
Australians. Perhaps they would be satis-
fied with a new division of duties and
a complete separation of powers—the
one enabling them to pay their way
without asking for alms every year, the
other establishing full national control
in national matters, with a generous
measure of decentralisation (there is
excessive centralisation now, not only
at Canberra, but at the State capitals)
and complete local self-government in
local matters. If this is really what they
are after they will find many Australians
in other States ready to co-operate with
them. Great reforms are necessary, but
they will have to be forced on the
politicians. The impulse and organisa-
tion must come from the people them-
selves.
RELIEF WORK MAKES REDS.
Where mass relief work leads is indi-
cated by what is happening at Lake Mac-
quarie (N.S.W.). It' is a seaside district
adjacent to the coalfields. In times of
unemployment, workers and their fami-
lies crowd there; the fishing is good and
rent is next to nothing. With a popula-
tion of about 30,000, the shire has an
income of £55,000, and it has (or had)
2861 men on “relief work.”
It is the usual sort of Government
relief work. “Construction of new swim-
ming baths, including excavating and
concreting” ; clearing and grubbing “five
acres of land on Pullbah Island” ; gut-
tering-construction, weed-chipping, sand-
shifting. Plenty of wet cement and
plenty of sore backs.
There are lots of Communists and “Red
Internationals” about. They understand
mob psychology, and want no better ma-
terial to work on than disgruntled gangs
engaged in unfamiliar toil with no
promise of permanence. “Job commit-
tees” were formed at Lake Macquarie,
and presently the shire engineer found
that “workers who did not contribute
weekly were excluded from nomination
as sub-gangers and ambulance men.” In
August it was reported to the Minister
that “the work in progress was unsatis-
factory”: job committees had laid down
the law of “one man, one tool” —which
meant that the man on the shoyel could
not use a pick or a mattock. Operations
were suspended.
They were resumed conditionally on the
“one-tool” rule being forbidden, and all
went smoothly for a month or two. Then
another indictment reached Sydney:
The officers had little or no supervision
over the men. It was impossible to indi-
cate the number of employed on certain
works ; there was no definite evidence
that many of the men actually worked
during any portion of the day.
The general practice was for men
to report, collect a pick or shovel or
mattock and be allotted to a sub-ganger.
But no record was kept of the number
of men allotted, the only check being the
tools issued. These, sometimes, were
collected at the end of the day “some
distance from the works.” No list of
men for individual jobs was available.
In one district, where three gangs had
been formed, two were found to be idle.
They said it was “smoke-oh.” On the
third job, the men were sitting about;
“when they sighted a car a few of them
started to work, but the majority did not
move.” Elsewhere, the inspectors should
have found 30 men working, but only
two were; in another gang a solitary
man was toiling; in still another only
the two gangers were doing anything.
Men were allowed travelling time from
depots, and the inspecting officer had no
doubt that the “depots were so arranged
as to provide for payment of travelling
time from men’s homes to the job.”
In Adamstown, where 268 men were
employed, “the majority were found loaf-
ing, and there did not appear to be any
supervision.”
On such “work” the Stevens Govern-
ment is spending millions and bragging
as if it were introducing the millennium.
Actually what it is doing is to assemble
61,000 men regularly for the benefit of
Red agitators and provide the latter
with a right atmosphere in which to gain
converts. Some Government relief work
is probably necessary, but there are
better schemes than these. The Queens-
land Land Administration Board intro-
duced one until the Labor Government
frowned on it—a system of loans to
settlers who were prepared to put men
on reproductive work such as ringbark-
ing, pasture-improvement and water
supply. There is large-scale forestry to
be tackled ; Britain this year is planting
50,000,000 trees, which will pay for them-
selves ultimately and the care of which
will find permanent work for a propor-
tion of those who plant them.
Lastly, there is goldmining. Bureau
of Census figures show that the brigade
of 5686 men who were employed in
goldmines in 1928 has grown to a divi-
sion—27,676 in 1933. Westralia has
found work for most of them, but the
same effort has not been made in other
States. Fields like the Palmer, Ravens-
wood and Croydon and scores of others
have never been fully exploited under
modern conditions. Lying in idle levels
in Queensland alone there may be
all of the square mile of 7dwt. ore, 132
feet deep, which Dr. Rivetf says is needed
to pay off the overseas debt. Every
grain of gold extracted would help;
every mine opened, however small, must
stimulate machinery manufacture and
assist the metal trades. Unemployment is
a national problem, and a national view
must be taken of it. Patchwork provin-
cial schemes, apart from the damage they
do to morale, are about as useful to the
country as heaving pound-notes into the
Pacific.
FLATS OR COTTAGES?
The agitation for a reform of housing
conditions is growing too strong in Mel-
bourne for the Government to hold out
much longer ; the slums —or, at any rate,
some of them —are sure to come down,
and in their place will be erected build-
ings fit for human occupation. Already
there is a conflict of opinion as to
whether flats or cottages should be built.
There is a justifiable feeling against the
tenement. The ideal home for any
family, rich or poor, is a structure stand-
ing in its own block of land. But there
are many factors to be considered.
Workmen must live within walking dis-
tance of their occupation or their wages
will be depleted by costs of transporta-
tion. In wharfside or factory areas,
where most of the slums predominate,
this is especially necessary. Loss of time
is a serious thing to workmen on the
lower-wage scale. Further, the flat with
all the rooms on one floor is preferable,
from every standpoint, to the old-time
terrace house, which wastes much room
in stairways, and which is an eternal
inconvenience in requiring ascents and
descents. But most important of all is
the fact that the necessary population
cannot be accommodated within reason-
able distance of working places unless
the flat or tenement principle is adopted.
To-day, a slum area contains a block
on which 10 miserable one-storey hovels
are situated. These hovels house, say,
50 people. By the erection of two-storey
flats to accommodate the same number of
people on the same area, half of that
area may be devoted to garden space
and children’s playing grounds. By flats
four-storeys high, three-fourths of the
area could be utilised for recreation, and,
if that were not needed, the narrow
streets which enclose many of these areas
could be widened. Far preferable it is
to house families in flats with plenty of
light and air space and land available
for the youngsters than to place them in
cottages, however desirable the cottage
may be, without outdoor facilities.
Much of the criticism against flat life
has been based on a recollection of old-
time tenement houses in Europe and
America. In Europe they are mostly
old converted terracfc houses with no
facilities for outdoor recreation what-
ever. In America, the playground con-
sists of the landing of the fire-escape, a
few feet square. But the tenement houses
of old Europe and America must not
be taken as models. The new European
flats which have arisen during the past
five years in Vienna, Berlin, Barcelona
and Moscow should be the models, with
provision for garden spaces in every
block.
There is no reason why the flat should
become a slum. Well-to-do people in
our capitals are even now rushing into
flat life in large numbers, mysterious as
it may appear. The workman’s flat can
be made as hygienic as that of the mil-
lionaire.
While rebuilding enthusiasm is going
strong, it might also be as well to plan
factory areas instead of letting the things
grow piecemeal. Factories need not be
eyesores. Some of our recently-erected
factories in Australian capitals have
shown that. There is no reason why
new factories should not be as good,
architecturally and hygienically, as the
best of those now in existence. Around
the actual factory there should be a
garden belt, and beyond that the flats
of the operatives should be erected.
FILM QUOTAS.
“The N. S. Wales Government proposes to
adopt an Australian film quota on the lines
recommended by a Royal Commission.”
Patriotism has always been the last
refuge of incompetence in the movie
business. It won quotas for several Con-
tinental nations in the last days of the
silents. France has had one since 1928,
yet according to London “Truth”:
Never a week passes in Paris without at
least six German films being shown with the
original German texts and French captions.
The other favorites are well-acted Holly-
wood productions, doubled so that French
voices emit synchronised words.
England adopted a quota system at
about the same time as France. Intensive
propaganda was started on behalf of the
industry ; the City invested ; society, led
by the Prince of Wales, gave moral
support. British films began to pour
into Australia; many of these inanities
are said to have cost less than £1 a foot.
The T.U.C. got alarmed, and passed a
resolution requiring British companies to
spend not less than £lO,OOO on each
movie, whereupon Paramount and Uni-
versal built studios at Elstree and im-
ported stars —fading ones: Corinne
Griffith, Gloria Swanson and the elder
Douglas Fairbanks.
Arliss makes his English pictures in
America; Noel Coward had “Caval-
cade” filmed there; Herbert Marshall,
Ronald Colman, Herbert Mundin and
dozens more virtually live there, and
writers like Lonsdale and actors like
Laughton, whose spiritual home is
the West End, spend half their time in
Hollywood.
The best British and French films—
the effervescent productions of Walls
and Clair ; some of the dramas of Hitch-
cock and Wilcox —would have been
made without quotas. The only thing
quotas have done for England and
France, which in the era of the stage con-
sistently produced most of the world’s
outstanding playwrights and players, has
been to hold them up to contempt as the
homes of movies which, for the most
part, are damned by critics and shunned
by the public.
There is only one justification for im-
posing a film quota on a nation or State
—the chance, however remote, that the
industry may respond by turning out
movies which the whole world of pic-
ture-goers will insist on seeing. Films
which will be national advertisement-
givers as well as money-spinners. Does
the offal shot out of local studios
suggest that this is likely in our case?
“Comedies” made in Australia have been
libels on our country and city folk;
other productions have been weak imita-
tions of overseas melodramas. Fortu-
nately for Australia’s reputation for in-
telligence in the U.S.A., American dis-
tributors won’t look at Australian films.
Unfortunately, there is a market for them
in the U.K.
If N. S. Wales adopts a quota sys-
tem, our films won’t get any better;
merely more numerous that, the
whole history of quotas shows. Prac-
tically the only overseas market for
them will be Britain, whose small tariff
on our pictures is likely to be waived
in return for the abolition of primage
on British films. Mr. F. W. Marks has
recommended a quota percentage for
N. S. Wales distributors rising from 5
p.c. in the first year to 15 p.c. in the
fifth, thus putting the State on a footing
with the U.K., where 15 p.c. of all
feature films shown have to be British.
An inevitable effect must be that after
five years, if not before, an immense per-
centage of films screened in N. S. Wales
will be the kind of British and Austra-
lian rubbish which picture-goers now
avoid. There may be money in it for
some exhibitors ; but that is no argument
for denying the masses the right to see
films about American life and films
about English life which have been
made by British producers and players
in America.
Good movies can’t be made by Act of
Parliament.
SECOND DIVVY.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Centenary and Calamity.
Victoria’s centenary will, unhappily, be
remembered for more than the air race
from London and the dedication of
the majestic Shrine of Remembrance by
a prince of the blood. Wild November
weather culminated in a storm which
scourged Gippsland and the south and
brought floods worse than the great in-
undation of 1891, and, in at least one
place on the Yarra, higher than the level
reached in 1863. And a steamer bound
from Warrnambool to Melbourne went
down with all hands.
Thirty-four people are reported to
have lost their lives. Six thousand per-
sons are homeless. The floods rendered
uninhabitable parts of Yarraside suburbs
and a considerable area in Gippsland.
Raging seas caused havoc at Port Phillip
watering-places.
The disaster, terrible and sudden
though it has been, would have taken a
far greater toll of human life had it not
been for the courage, -resource and, in
many cases, absolute heroism of the
people. In Gippsland the police promptly
organised a rescue brigade, commandeer-
ing every boat available, and they did
not have to call twice for volunteer
helpers. In the swirling lake that a few
hours before had been the Latrobe val-
ley, they saved dozens of lives, groping
about by torchlight in water up to their
armpits. A constable who dislocated his
shoulder entering a house pulled it back
again in the dark and went on working
till the morning.
At Koo-wee-rup those residents who
were lucky enough to get away from their
houses before the flood cut them off
made their way to the railway station,
where timber was stacked, lashed rafts
together, and set forth on these clumsy
contraptions to rescue marooned resi-
dents who, in addition to their other
troubles, were beset by swimming snakes.
At Chelsea 1500 women and children
were saved owing to the promptitude
with which volunteers in fishermen’s
boats hurried to the rescue. From all
quarters come stories of great risks faced
without flinching. Lives were lost that
life might be saved.
The State has suffered heavily, but its
experience is not all to be set down on
the debit side. The spirit of the pioneers,
their aptitude for emergencies and their
desperate courage have been demonstrated
to be still alive. Batman and his contem-
poraries did more than found a village.
They helped to found a brave nation.
4
A Bungled Opportunity.
Commonwealth Ministers and represen-
tatives of the M.L. Government dis-
cussed trade relations for the best part
of a week at Canberra, and failed to
reach an agreement on any point. The
thing seems to have been badly man-
aged on both sides.
The Maorilanders objected to admit-
ting oranges and lemons from States
other than S.A. on the ground that if
they did so they would lose their U.S.A.
market for apples and pears—Uncle Sam
bars the products of countries that run
any risk of importing the Mediterranean
fruit-fly. The Australian side of the con-
ference boggled at M.L.’s demand for
a potato quota —10,000 tons a year.
What the American apple market is
worth to M.L. is not ascertainable from
statistical sources, being of very recent
growth—last year the total fruit exports
of M.L. to U.S.A. were valued at only
£4 —but whatever it amounts to it is a
precarious benefit, with Mr. Roosevelt
anxious to go on being Father Christ-
mas to American orchardists. On the
other hand, M.L.’s annual total imports
of citrus fruits don’t amount to more
than £lOO,OO0 —last year they were con-
siderably less than that. From S.A. came
£40,000 worth, from the U.S.A. £21,000
worth.
There are other avenues of trade veiy
much more important to both Australia
and Maoriland, and they should not
have been left out of the picture. It is
unfortunate that quotas should have been
suggested. Gordon Coates is a farmer,
with a farmer’s outlook, and the word
quota must have reminded him of Major
Elliot’s proposals, which are a night-
mare to Maoriland agrarians. It would
have been much simpler to arrange that,
whenever potatoes are cheaper in M.L.
than in Australia to a degree to be agreed
upon, they might be sent across the
water. With that settled, and perhaps
one or two little concessions on other
trade offered, the Maorilanders would
have faced the citrus question in a friend-
lier spirit.
Negotiations should not be abandoned
because politicians have failed. The
chances are that six businessmen con-
versant with farming conditions, three a
side, could arrive at an arrangement
satisfactory to both countries.
4
More Palliatives.
A Commonwealth Wheat Commission
has been wandering round Aus-
tralia for a year or so finding out things
which any bank could have told it. It
has recommended another relief scheme
for wheatfarmers; a bounty of 3d. a
bushel on marketable wheat, plus
£1,926,000 on an acreage basis and
£574,000 for special cases of distress —
£4,000,000 altogether. There is a case
for a bounty, and for the relief of
farmers smitten with drought, hail and
rust; but payment on an acreage basis,
the good, bad and indifferent to get
the same amount per acre, is 7 all wrong.
It is proposed that the £4,000,000
should be raised by a flour tax, to oper-
ate from January 1 until the money is
found or the difference is made up. The
commission suggests that this tax should
be equal to the margin between Mel-
bourne flour prices fixed by the Vic-
torian millers under supervision by an
advisory committee and £l2 per short
ton. There are to be no more export
quotas —the international conference at
Budapest has broken down.
At present wheat is about 2s. 3d. at
port, and the Melbourne price of flour
is £7 per ton. At £5 a ton on flour which
goes into home consumption—6so,ooo-
- tons p.a.—the tax would return
£3,250,000. With the yield estimated at
120,000,000 bushels, the overall subsidy
to the industry would be about Bd. a
bushel, giving farmers, who are now get-
ting Is. Bd. at sidings, 2s. 4d. to 2s. 7d.
a bushel.
The commission says that four-fifths
of the farmers could make a reasonable
living at 4s. 9d. a bushel, and no doubt
they could. But it hasn’t gone very far
in settling the problem it was appointed
to grapple with. It has not even explained
why the market price is so low with
crops so light in most countries. The
U.S.A. harvest —493,000,000 bushels —
will be the poorest since 1893.

The Duke and the Historian.
“J.D.” peers into the future:
It is interesting to envisage a meeting at
Buckingham Palace between the Duke half a
century hence and the world-famous historian
who has come to be known as the Gibbon of
the Commonwealth. The Duke has congratu-
lated the writer on being made a peer, and the
conversation has turned to Sydney.
Historian: “You were extraordinarily for-
tunate in visiting the city when you did, sir—
at a time when Australia’s literary and artistic
renaissance had just begun; when many front-
line generals of the First World War were still
alive; when direct descendants of immortals
were to be met in the haunts of their forebears.
What a privilege to have talked to a Went-
worth who remembered William Charles!”
H.R.H.: “Wentworth, Wentworth —I can’t
recall anybody of that name being presented
to me. Who was William Charles?”
H.: “He gave his colony self-government, sir.
A politician, but a's far above the politicians
of 1934 as a mountain is above the sea. Did
Vaucluse House impress you?”
H.R.H.: “I was taken to- Koala Park—
I have some photos, to this day—but Vaucluse
House, Vaucluse House”
H. (hurriedly): “Sydneyites of the period
were a little careless of their historical treasures,
sir; but at least they honored their war heroes.
You foregathered, no doubt, with Charles
Rosenthal and Granville Ryrie, and met John
Antill in Manly?”
H.R.H.: “I met nobody but aldermen and
surfers in Manly, and I don’t recall Ryrie or
Rosenthal. About the only Sydney man I do
recall clearly—and I won’t forget him till my
dying day—is a stout little chap named
Jeevons.”
H.: “Stevens, sir. Sir Bertie Stevens he
became. But, after all, the really significant
people of the era were neither its soldiers —
who belonged, after all, to a previous genera-
tion—nor its politicians, but”
H.R.H. (interrupting with some heat): “I
know what you’re going to say. Why didn’t
I meet the genuine celebrities? Why didn’t
I meet McCrae, whose writings are alive,
while the politicians and aldermen I met are
dead and forgotten? Why didn’t I meet
Norman Lindsay, the most interesting figure
of his generation, the genius who could do
everything? Why didn’t I meet anybody in
1934 that men like yourself talk and write
about now? The answer is I never got a
chance, my dear sir. I didn’t choose my associ-
ates ; they were forced on me by wooden-
headed officials.”
H.: “You must have had a dull tour, sir.”
H.R.H.: “Dull! If I hadn’t taken up menu-
collecting I’d have gone crazy!”

Still Goosestepping.
“One of the foundations of suspicion
and malaise in Europe to-day,” said Mr.
Baldwin in the House of Commons,
“is not only fear but ignorance out-
side Germany regarding what is going
on in Germany.” In. 1914 the Germans
were letting it be understood that they
had an invincible army and navy. Also
an abiding grievance: they wanted places
in the sun, and wouldn’t be pacifist till
they got them. They seem to be as
militaristic as ever; to quote Mr. Bald-
win again, “They withdrew from the
Disarmament Conference when there
was a fair chance of accomplishing some-
thing substantial.” The only real differ-
ence between their procedure in 1914
and in 1934 is that they are goosestep-
ping now to the tune of ’planes and
poison gas.
Germans say that the Blitz ’plane can
do 250 m.p.h. and land at under 60
m.p.h.; that it can carry 10001 b. of
bombs for 1000 miles ; that a fleet of
Blitzes, each with 500 two-pound ther-
mite bombs, could reduce London to
ashes in a few hours.
The gas with which Germany is
allegedly ready to wage its “bacterio-
logical offensive” is described by Dr.
Helmut Klotz in the Berlin “Diaries”—
a history of Hitlerism. The invention
of one Stolzenburg, a patriotic chemist,
this gas “can be produced in any quan-
tity from home materials without the
slightest difficulty; it is much cheaper
than any other discovered. And incom-
parably more effective!”
The stories of Germany’s preparations
may or may not be true, but it is signi-
ficant that they come from Germany.
At the best, they indicate a will to war.
What lunacy, in the circumstances, for
the British Empire, or any other Power
with possessions that the Germans covet,
to talk, much less act, pacifism! In this
connection Viscount Cecil of Chelwood
wrote the other day in the “Church
Times” (of Australia):
There exists now, as in 1914, an impres-
sion in certain parts of Europe that Great
Britain would in no circumstances allow
itself to be involved in another European
conflict. But foreigners would do well not
to allow themselves to be misled by ultra-
pacific declarations.
And Lord Cecil has been fighting for
peace ever since the Armistice!
«
“Always With Us.”
In announcing that practically 40 per
cent, of persons at present in receipt of
sustenance are unlikely to be absorbed
into industry again, Vic. Minister Kent
Hughes added: “It seems unfortunate
that a large number of men seem to have
accepted sustenance more or less as a
permanent institution, and appear to have
little ambition to rise above the con-
ditions applying.”
It is unfortunate, but it is inevitable
that continued unemployment will de-
stroy the morale of all but hardy charac-
ters. Human beings of fair average
quality, not weaklings, not crooks, will
in four cases out of five lose a large pro-
portion of their innate honesty should
they be cast among crooks for any long
period, especially if they are forced to
the belief that they are being treated un-
fairly by society as a whole. The 40 per
cent, of whom Mr. Kent Hughes speaks
have been for three or more years
associating with others of their kind —
some chronic loafers, some crooks lack-
ing the ability or the courage to be real
criminals, all entertaining a bitter if un-
justifiable hatred of the society which
denies them a living. Little wonder is it
that, when their first period of anger
passes and malnutrition and other evils
of poverty have done their work, they
resign themselves to the situation. The
dole is there; they will take it. Nothing
else matters.
Minister Kent Hughes has some
reason for thinking that such men can
never come back. It would be a long
and difficult job to bring them once more
into line with their fellows. Here and
there the miracle may be worked with
the younger ones —assuming that what
are known as normal conditions return —
but the old, the broken and the de-
moralised will have to be kept somehow
until they die. They are down and out,
and, as Philosopher Dooley once said,
“A man is never down until he’s dead or
he’s lost his courage, which is the same
thing.”

Broadcasting Parliament.
The Tasmanian Parliament proposes to
have its proceedings broadcast. Stanley
Argyle in Victoria does not like the idea:
Good gracious, no! I hesitate to think
what would happen if we did; there
would be a never-ending stream of talk
and propaganda.
It might do good—but, again, it might
not. At any rate, while Parliamentary
publicity is limited, constituents get an
occasional glance at their members as
they really are. Broadcasting of Parlia-
mentary speeches would inevitably de-
velop a new technique designed to
appeal to feminine electors.
Mr. Lang developed one between the
Bulli by-election in 1933 and the Com-
monwealth election of 1934. Those who
heard him over the air in the former
fight found him no different from the
Lang they had known for years—full of
unbridled sneers at his enemies, heated
in tone and throwing words at his audi-
ence like a boy heaving a tennis ball at
a wall. But the Lang who gave Sunday-
night chats in 1934 might have been
pictured as a suave old gentleman in
carpet slippers with a few slight pre-
judices but no rancor.
All politicians would get like that if
they were regularly broadcast, and, in-
stead of being chosen because their
names begin with “A” and because they
are able to “beef it out,” they would find
their selection dependent on having a
moniker which comes clearly over the
radio, combined with voices like those
of Bing Crosby. And proceedings
would become so suavely uneventful
that old hands would die of inanition
in the House instead of merely going to
sleep, as they do now.

“Nagheer” : The sampan influx, with
the assistance of Commonwealth and
State restrictions and taxes (from both
of which sampans are free), threatens to
finish Thursday Island. The biggest
boatslip, bought by Australians from
Japanese a few years ago, has had to
close down. Boats are clearing out for
Merauke or the Aru Islands, both in
Dutch territory. There they will be wel-
comed.
If Canberra took the least interest in
the marine riches of Torres Strait and
the Barrier, or in the Australian citizens
who are being driven to another coun-
try, the sampans could be beaten at their
own game with very little loss of revenue
and no risk of international trouble.
Moreover, Japanese ideas of the Aus-
tralian who can’t pick up good money
from his own doorstep would undergo
a salutary change.

Creating a Shark Menace.
A Sydney concern, working in conjunc-
tion with one of the broadcasting sta-
tions, is inaugurating an aerial shark
patrol.
The idea is quite simple. The ’plane
flies up and down the whole stretch of
surfing beaches looking for sharks.
When it spots one it immediately sends
a wireless to the station. The beach
threatened is then informed and the
alarm given. An excellent plan; but if
the watcher conscientiously reports every
shark seen the alarm bells will be kept
pretty busy. Pilots who fly along the
coast usually see dozens of sharks, and
one such trip would probably be suffi-
cient to put a cautious person off surfing
for the rest of his life; yet in the course
of a summer comparatively few tragedies
occur.
The menace is greatly overrated. The
motor deaths in almost any week out-
number a whole season’s shark victims,
yet nobody fears motor-cars.
When a similar scheme was tried at
a Queensland bathing resort the towns-
people asked for it to be stopped, as the
continual alarms were frightening people
away from the place.
The effect on Sydney beaches will
either be something similar or else
surfers will become so accustomed to
the shark bell that they will disregard
it. Then ultimately a genuine alarm
for a close-in shark will be ignored, with
tragic results.
As an advertising stunt the scheme is
probably first-class. From a utility point
of view there would be no objection if
it were merely useless. But it is worse
than,that. It is dangerous.

The Index Canberrorius.
Only two authors affected by the cen-
sorship—Harcourt (“Upsurge”) and
Mann (“Flesh in Armor”) —were among
those present at a meeting of pro-
test held at Melbourne. The rest
of the gathering comprised writers who
have not yet come under the ban —jour-
nalists, university professors and lecturers
and professional men and women inter-
ested in the arts. Apologies—one from a
Judge—were numerous, and all wished
well of the movement.
Possibly the most telling point was
made by Professor Giblin, who contended
that “Brave New World” was absolutely
puritanical in tendency. Dr. Reg Ellery
spilt the beans by telling that his library
of banned books was eagerly draw'n upon,
by politicians. McMahon Ball, a uni-
versity lecturer, held that Australians
were not only required to reject Com-
munism but were not permitted to under-
stand it.
The gathering was unanimous and en-
thusiastic, and the expected resolutions
were passed unanimously. Resolutions of
a handful of intellectuals, however in-
fluential in their own line, have little
weight with the Babbitts of bureaucracy ;
but the daily press is beginning to take a
hand in the censorship business, and that
means that the general public is growing
interested. There are possibilities of a
sane administration of book censorship
in the near future —which is something.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Hardy”: While one Sydney
newspaper persistently refers to
our royal visitor as “the Duke,”
a rival broadsheet never alludes
to him except as “the Prince.”
This divergence has created some
confusion in the mind of an
elderly lady of my acquaint-
ance who saw his Highness
drive past with his equerry.
“Did you see the Prince?” some-
one asked her a few days later.
“Saw ’em both,” she replied
proudly; “the prince and the
Duke. My word, they do look
alike!”
“Tamar”: Dr. E. Henty Smallpage,
lecturing at Sydney on the Henty
brothers, is reported as saying that
one of them, James, became Premier
of Tasmania. There is some obvious
inaccuracy here, for no Henty figures in
the list of the Speck’s Premiers. One of
them did hold office for several years;
he was Colonial Secretary in four dif-
ferent Ministries between 1857 and 1861.
But his name wasn’t James; it was
William.

“Jay-walker”: Announced that a
Sydney firm of jewellers, having suffered
three smash-and-grab raids within a few
months, is protecting its show windows
with an “invisible ray” device which lets
down a steel shutter the moment any
object (such as a brick or a hand with
a brick in it) passes through the glass.
It was further mentioned that any in-
truding hand would probably be cut off.
A device such as this, it seems to me,
carries some dangerous possibilities for
those employing it as well as for poten-
tial criminals. A perfectly innocent per-
son may fall or be pushed through a
shop window. I have seen several in-
stances of this; once when a motor-
cyclist mounted the footpath to avoid
running down a child; once when a
window-cleaner was knocked off his
ladder; twice when people were pushed
through windows by the pressure of
patriotic crowds. Surely windows can
be protected with a grille or with wired
glass, without setting a man-trap inside.
* * * *
“Biltong”: In one of J. M. Barrie’s
earliest novels there is a story of a Scot-
tish editor who left a foreman printer
in charge of his paper when the Zulus
were first beginning to make trouble.
A cable came through announcing
that Cetewayo had taken umbrage
(at something or other), and the
editor, returning, found his locum
tenens desperately trying to locate
Umbrage on the map—the headline
“Another Zulu Success” being in type.
Last week a Sydney paper published
a cable from Durban that must have
provided a few chuckles from those who
know anything of the sub-continent.
Two powerful Zulu tribes, it was an-
nounced, had begun to quarrel, and only
the timely intervention of a small force
of Natal police prevented a massacre.
The police were compelled to fire in
self-defence on Impi and Cunus numbering
more than 1000, and succeeded in scatter-
ing them. Several Cunus were killed.
What number of “Impis” bit the dust is
left to the imagination.

“Demonax”: That children playing
with blocks should often be found
arranging them into forms resem-
bling Stonehenge (B. 21/11 / ’34) is
by no means so strange as it may seem.
Dr. Jung would see in it an instance of
the workings of what he calls the “Col-
lective Unconscious Mind.” Jung says,
in effect, that in every individual, in
addition to personal memories, there are
the great “primordial images,” the in-
herited potentialities of mankind. One
result of this is that myths and legends
are encountered all over the world in
almost identical forms. Children, especi-
ally very young ones, have minds in
which these images are very much nearer
“I ask y’t’ drink the health o’ the bride an' bridegroom, coupled with the names
o’ Prince George an’ ’is new missus, Princess Mariner.”
the surface than in normal adults. The
commonest medium through which the
“Collective Unconscious” finds expres-
sion, however, is in dreams.
“Rahoy”: “Enemcue’s” theory struck
me as rather far-fetched ; but now I’m a
bit with him. The other morning, while
yarning over the fence to neighbor Isaac-
stein, I noticed his young hopeful, aged
about three, playing with some old tennis
balls. He repeatedly arranged three of
them in a triangle.

“G. Trotter”: Melbourne is at last
waking up to the value of decorating
its open spaces with statuary. When
I was in America a few years ago I con-
gratulated a citizen of one town on the
appreciation of the artistic it had
shown by scattering the parks with good
statues. “Artistic appreciation nothing!”
he said. “Just a plain business prahpo-
sition. Those statues return a clear 10
per cent, in tourist traffic.” I pondered
over the wonderful acumen of those
Yankee city fathers, until I suddenly re-
membered that there was in my own
country a town called Ballarat, which
must have paid for its dozen indifferent
effigies over and over again in receipts
from tourists attracted by hearing about
“the City of Statues.” Australia has a
dozen good sculptors doing little or
nothing.
* * * *
“D.”: The best tribute I know to the
power of the oft-written word is Syd-
ney’s belief in its “shark menace.” Rela-
tively to the numbers of those who surf
and golf respectively more people have
been killed and injured by balls on Syd-
ney and suburban links than by sharks
on Sydney and suburban beaches. An-
other press-inspired fallacy is the in-
famy of “shark-baiting.” Practically all
the victims of shark attacks during the
past 20 years have been grabbed within
a few yards of the shore. An effect
of shark-propaganda has been to make
a swim off a Sydney beach a marrow-
freezing adventure for hundreds of thou-
sands. They have never witnessed a
shark attack or met anybody who has ;
many have never seen a grown shark in
the wild state, but they live in dread so
long as they are in the water. Hence the
demand for shark-proof enclosures. A
shark-proof enclosure inspires Sydney-
ites as the word “Mesopotamia” inspired
the fabled old woman ; of no value in
ilself, but inexpressibly comforting.

“Scribe”: Some well-meaning people
are mildly agitating for the teaching ol
oratory in the schools. If they take my
advice they’ll leave well alone. As a
newspaperman, I’ve found that when
people have something to say which is
worth saying they can always do it —-even
those naturally nervous and hesitant.
Many years ago l was with a Parlia-
mentary party touring the remote parts
of Vic. A gang of navvies with a griev-
ance held up the party and put their
case. Each man submitted his argu-
ments clearly and without verbiage;
one man was particularly effective.
Ten years later I visited the same dis-
trict on the occasion of some public cele-
bration. Heading the reception com-
mittee T found my friend the eloquent
navvy. He was now president of the
shire, and of all the bosh I ever heard
spoken his was the worst. He had
studied oratory as he had progressed
financially—and with disastrous results.

“Cosmos” on .bribery:
My objection to leagues against bribery is
(hat 99 p.c. of the victims deserve all they get.
Why waste time and money protecting fools
from their folly?
A butcher offers a bribe to a cook to
spoil in cooking the joints supplied by a
rival.
Shop-assistants are bribed to press certain
articles on their employers’ customers.
A chauffeur is bribed to give a receipt for
double as much petrol as his employer
has used.
The 50-odd horrible examples cited by Aus-
tralia’s new Bribery Prevention League are all
of the above character. Bribery in the domestic
and commercial spheres is only remunerative
for any length of time when the employer is
such a casual idiot that he catf’t spot that
his meat is being ruined by the cook; doesn’t
notice that his washing and petrol bills have
doubled; never learns, as a shopkeeper, that
customers are being badgered to buy what they
haven’t asked for. Pinching careless employers’
small change, whisky, petrol, underclothes,
books, trinkets, etc., is far simpler and
safer than bribe-taking (for one thing it doesn’t
necessitate an accomplice); and it is accordingly
far commoner. But how absurd to start a
League for the Prevention of Scrounging!

“King’s Regs.”: “Quat’ Bras” is over-
stating the case when he says that the
youngest subaltern in the Brigade of
Guards must have a private income of
at least £5OO p.a. (B. 21/11/’34). In
pre-war days a Guards subaltern started
on about £9O a year in the way of pay,
and could easily get by if he had £2OO
a year of his own. The only circum-
stance that made life in a Guards regi-
ment expensive was the messing, and
there is no reason on earth why an Aus-
tralian Guards regiment should follow
the same foolish principle. As for “a
Guards officer with an Aussie accent,”
the phenomenon was not unknown dur-
ing the war. In any case, the proposal
is not “to dump” an Australian Guards
regiment in London, but to raise one for
home use, as has already been done in
Canada.

“Runa”: In a wayback M.L. townlet
the postmistress was the leader of the
local prohibitionists. She was a popular
lass, and did the local folk many good
turns, which brought her in a fine reward
at Christmastime, including a case of
mixed alcoholic beverages from a wealthy
run-holder who was unaware of the
lady’s temperance proclivities. The post-
mistress disliked the idea of destroying
the gift, so it was parked in the wash-
house, to be handed on at the first suit-
able opportunity. By the irony of fate a
fire broke out in the P.O. on New Year’s
Eve, and the entire population of the
town rushed to salvage goods and papers.
One willing worker came across the case,
broke a bottle in salvaging it, and
promptly broadcast the glad news.
Helpers suffering from heat or fatigue
were urged by comrades to take a
stimulant, and presently the case, placed
on a convenient lorry, began to distract
attention from the fire. What followed
towards dawn is still the scandal of the
township, and only the drastic action of
a few sober citizens restored order and
delivered the revellers at their homes.
The unhappy postmistress applied for a
transfer, and got it.

“Olla Podrida”: When the Sussex was
tying up at Ocean Pier, Hobart, the
Duke received a royal salute that was
refreshingly unique. The dole
workers on a new tourist road
to the pinnacle of Mt. Welling-
ton contributed it; they fired
off 21 blasts, so perfectly timed
that the performance reminded
one of the forts at Gibraltar.
The effect was striking, but it
has occasioned some after-
trouble. The City Council
supervises the work, but the
Speck Government foots the
bill for material, wages, etc., and as
the “salute” was planned and executed
without authority of either the Auditor-
General may have to decide which of
them is liable for the extra labor, fuse
and gelignite.

“J.8.C.”: The dailies have been giving
prominence to a cable from London tell-
ing how a Northampton woman gave
birth to twin daughters with an interval
of three days between. No need
to go from home for instances of
this sort of thing. Only last week
in Ivanhoe (N.S.W.) a woman gave birth
to a healthy 7Jlb. baby. Forty-two hours
later, in Wilcannia Hospital, 120 miles
from Ivanhoe, she repeated the feat with
a 7i-pounder. All three are alive and
well.
Norman Campbell: “Second Divvy”
(B. 21/11/’34) wonders how Monash’s
letters got to Australia uncensored.
Monash knew the rules well enough;
for a month after the start of the war he
was Chief Censor. I quote from a letter
he wrote on April 19, 1929—he had been
telling me how, on Evacuation Night, he
had suddenly remembered that he had
left all his papers and letters in his dugout
and had run back, alone, from the wharf
to recover them. One pictures a solitary
little figure scudding through the dark-
ness with not a man between him and
the Turkish Army:
The dispatch case which I went back
to find contained not only the whole
of the orders for the evacuation—which
we had been strictly enjoined to destroy
after perusal, but which I wickedly hung
on to as an historical souvenir—but also
the diary letter to my folk at home, with
a detailed account of everything that had
happened in my part of the Anzac posi-
tion from the date —some 10 days pre-
viously—when senior officers first became
aware, confidentially, that the evacuation
was to take place.
It would have been very disastrous if
all these documents had fallen into
enemy hands.
As regards the diary letter above referred
to, I managed (again against orders) to get
this smuggled to Australia, so as to escape
the censorship, and subsequently, during
1916, many copies of the same were made
and widely circulated among my acquaint-
ances and interested strangers.
I hope that in writing about these
matters you do not deal too hardly with
me for “disobeying orders.”
Rest his soul, he was a very human
man!
TWO CHRISTMAS DINNERS.
“To enable prisoners to share in the enthusiasm
over the royal visit, the State Government has
arranged: that two Christmas dinners shall be served
in (Queensland gaols—one on the day when the Duke
arrives in Brisbane, the other on December 25.”
Let this glad year in letters red be scored
For chaps whose fare is mostly plain and
rough!
Twice shall the sirloin smoke upon the board
And twice the holly decorate the duff.
Before the Duke departs, ’tis good to think
That even luckless souls upon the inner
Side of full many a frowning Queensland clink
Will get a double whack of Christmas dinner.
Time was, when kings and princes rode around
Their realms, the prison gates were opened
wide,
And hordes of grateful malefactors found
Themselves at large upon the countryside.
Old customs fade in this less spacious age
And royalty’s prerogatives grow thinner,
But, still and all, a flock of birds in cage
This month will peck a doubled Christmas
dinner.
Knighthoods for mayors, and sudden holidays
For kids at school —as is indeed but meet;
Brass bands that blare and bray, and flags that
blaze
For all who hold the freedom of the street.
Yet high and low, it goes without demur,
Should have existence brightened, saint and
sinner;
He’ll bless the Duke, will many a bloke in
“stir,”
Who’s here to duplicate his Christmas dinner.
Mementoes rare in many a treasured card,
And gracious memories for womankind,
And more substantial tokens of regard
Our soldier Prince will doubtless leave behind.
But you, his Dad’s involuntary guests,
Keep it in mind you, too, arre on a winner:
Before young ’Thirty-five the barrier breasts
You’ll get a double whack of Christmas
dinner!

“Diarmad”: I don’t know much about
Gaelic, but A. B. Piddington’s assertions
in the Kisch case that it is “not a Euro-
pean language but a remnant of one”
and that “.Scottish Gaelic is a dead lan-
guage” seem directly contradicted by the
reference books. The “Encyclopaedia
Brittanica” says that in the Highlands
about 300,000 people still use the old
Gaelic tongue of Scotland. In Ireland,
it adds, the Gaelic, resembling closely
in its structure the Scottish article, is
spoken by a million people, and there
is still a vast number of Welshmen and
Welshwomen who would probably find
Gaelic, the common heritage of the Celts,
a great deal more intelligible than Eng-
lish. If Gaelic is a dying tongue it is
obviously dying hard ; it most certainly
isn’t a dead one. From the same author-
ity I learn that Gaelic is admirably
adapted for the purposes of the poet as
well as for the communication of reli-
gious knowledge. Its additional merit
as a test for undesired or undesirable
immigrants is, of course, quite a modern
discovery.

“Baffled”: One of the sickliest, weari-
est and most dispirited kids of my
acquaintance is a three-year-old who has
had a trained nurse from birth, the best
of doctors when she so much as got the
snuffles, and milk and similar alleged
essentials taken at regular intervals, as
ordered by nutritional experts. Quite
the cheeriest and most vigorous human
being I have met is a two-year-old boy
of Italian stock. He lives in a back
street and never goes to the country or
“Auntie, ask him to show us the baby.”
the seaside. He hasn’t drunk milk since
he was weaned ; macaroni is one of his
favorite dishes, and his beverage is water,
occasionally diluted with wine. He
doesn’t seem to bother much about
baths, and his playground is the sunless
garage which his people own. Would
he have been any fitter with a “scientific”
upbringing? Impossible. Would the
girl have been any feebler with his up-
bringing? Also impossible, though she
might conceivably have died. Jack John-
son, a physical marvel —when last in
Sydney he could hold Peter Felix out
at arm’s length—used to laugh at health
rules. He had starved as a child and
slept uncovered on boards as a youth ;
yet he claimed 25 years ago never to
have taken a dose of medicine or con-
sulted a dentist except for the purpose
of having gold and diamonds put into
his flawless teeth.

“Demonax”: A lot of wild specula-

gas and chemicals will play in future
warfare. An article I recently read dis-
courses gloomily on a “secret synthesis”
of gases and chemicals
guaranteed to kill if
they only come in con-
tact with the skin ; no
kind of clothing or gas
masks, the writer in-
sists, will be of the
slightest avail against
them. This last is
drivel. Although our
knowledge of poison
gases and chemicals has
increased materially
since the war, no gas
or chemical could be
distributed in sufficient
concentration to have
the slightest effect or
penetrability on airtight
rubber clothing. Rubber is one of
the most resistant substances to chemi-
cal attack ; only the most concen-
trated acids affect it, and that slowly.
One of the most active substances
known to science—hydrofluoric acid —is
actually stored' in rubber containers.
“M.G.”: I used to wonder why Rus-
sian princes were so numerous until one
of them called to see me during the war
years. His card bore the name of Prinz
Boshterkoff, or something to that effect,
and he followed it in, a tall, shabby man
wearing a cloth cap and speaking the
dialect of Chicago, 111. When I said
something about his title he enlightened
me. “I’m the genuine article,” he
assured me ; “you can check up on that
at the Russian Cahnsul’s if you think
it worth while. But get this first: I’m
a Cahssack of the Don. For centuries
our people were in revolt against the
Russian Government. This went on till
Russia gaht sorter tired and offered to
take us into the Empire. One of the
terms of peace was that everybody above
the rank of —what do you call 'em here?
—a J.P. should be made a prince. And
that’s how I gaht to be one. But, say,
there’s nothing in this prince business. 1
beat it early for N’Yark and gaht me a
jahb in Wanamaker’s store.”

“In Vino”: Some interesting if mainly
humorous information about the Poet
Laureate’s job was scattered around at the
Sydney luncheon to John Masefield ; but
such records as exist are so full of diver-
gences that it is doubtful if anyone can
say for certain who first held the billet.
There is more agreement among his-
torians about the wine that went with
it. Rtchaid 11., according to one chroni-
cter, granted Chaucer’s request for an
annual allowance of grapejuice, but the
amount and the brand are nowhere speci-
tied until Stuart times, when Charles I.

of Canary Spanish wine to be taken out
of the King’s store.” A tierce is 36
Imperial gallons ; so that, when the sum
of £27 was substituted for the wine in
Southey’s time (possibly in deference to
the blue ribbonites of the period), it
looks as if half a crown was regarded
as a fair market price for a bottle of
prime Canary or Madeira. Southey and
Wordsworth and even Tennyson were
supposed to be drawing £127 p.a., an
appreciable if not a handsome honor-
arium, but what Austin and Bridges re-
ceived and Masefield draws is not so
easy to say Certainly it won't be found
in any of the handbooks.

“Adelaide”: The long arm of the Law
has gathered in, in S.A., a man charged
with taking money 13 years ago from
another’s pocket outside the tote at Mor-
phetville. He denies the impeachment,
and explains that he absconded from his
bail in 1921 untried merely because he
“did not want to be mixed up with law-
suits.” However, the owner of the
money and the arresting constable are
still available, and the Court has at last
said guilty.

“Medic’s” theory:—
The U.S.A.’s “Too Old at Forty” crusade
is reported to have gone the way of rninnie-
golf. It had even less right to survive. A
Kelso 6 King and Thmnalfßuclttand 6
old at 80-odd, and George Judah Cohen isn’t
too old at 92. It is the same in the physical
sphere. Dozens of fathers in the fifties can
shoot straighter, swim faster, ride harder and
play better golf and cricket than their sons
in the twenties. Similarly dozens of mothers
are fitter than their daughters. Michael Scott,
who is nearing sixty, could give a stroke a
hole to 99 young British amateurs out of
every hundred ; Hobbs at 50-odd is among
the ten best bats in the world. Some people
are old at 21 ; others keep their teeth, figures,
and bodily and mental energy till an acci-
dent or some such anaesthetic disease as
pneumonia bears them off. My view is that
it’s entirely a matter of breeding. The lucky
ones are well bred in the only true sense of
the word.

“Ictinus”: Without wishing to look a
gift unicorn in the mouth, I feel sorry that
J. N. Reeson presented those heraldic
figures from the House of Commons to
“adorn” Melbourne Parliament House.
The figures, like the rest of Westminster,
aie of Gothic design, while Melbourne
Parliament House is probably the finest
example of severe classic work in the
Commonwealth. On this building will
be stuck two utterly incongruous and in-
harmonious pieces of sculpture, to the
disfigurement of the whole. I am aware
that precedents may be quoted, but some
of those precedents—the interior of
Westminster Abbey is possibly the most
horrid example—have nauseated people
with any taste or any architectural know-
ledge for generations.

“Lindley M.”: Why ask obviously un-
desirable immigrants to pass dictation
tests in Gaelic? As well test them in
movie American. And why have the
tests administered by policemen? The
average State schoolmaster is capable of
supplying a passage in English that
would stump any alien intruder whom I
have encountered (Kisch is a case in
point), and someone of the status of a
schoolmaster or university professor
should obviously award the marks. For
English-speaking agitators the tests might
be in French or German, but I have yet
to meet one who couldn’t be bowled out
with half a page from, say, Carlyle’s
“French Revolution,” not to mention a
slab by the author of “Religio Medici”
or a few of Gibbon’s thunderous sen-
tences. The moral effect of outing a Bol-
shie for ignorance of the language
spoken here would be good; to push
one out for not knowing a language we
don’t know ourselves looks too much
like sharp practice,

About milit titles (B .

14/11/34). Our political chairman was
hauled over the coals for introducing the
Federal Minister as “Mr. Casey” ; he
pleaded that the Minister himself had
told him, “I am a civilian now, and the
military title drops.” Which reminds
me that years back our postmaster, a
retired officer, insisted on being ad-
dressed as “Captain” by his staff,
A telegraphist happened along who
was an active major. He got his
first instruction: “Mr. Blank, you
will” “Pardon, Captain,” he broke
in, “Majah Blank! ” Along at once came
a circular abolishing all distinctions of
rank when on duty. Blank grinned and
said, “I’d have made the little snob
sa lute me every time we passed, only

issued dealing with the business. There
are generals who hang on to their titles
though they never heard a gun fired in

mean something.

met in the street a man known to me as
a cobbler, and mentioned that I had
some boots in need of repair. Promptly
I was invited to bring them along to his
“studio.” It sounded like a jest, but I
have since found that he seriously calls
his place of business a “Repair Studio.”
Incited to further investigations by the
bootman’s effort, I have located a “Meat
Studio” and a “studio” devoted to
the artistic contemplation (and sale) of
fruit. Incidentally, the “atelier” once
a favorite of photographers has entirely
disappeared.
HE HAD NO GAELIC.
The Gaelic is proven
A glorious tongue
When love lays are woven
Or war ballads sung.
Now tender, now tragic,
It grips and it gripes;
It hums with the magic
And skirl of the pipes.
To Celts it’s a festive
And delicate dish,
But it beat the digestive
Arrangements of Kisch.
No wonder he’s pettish.
A chap who can spruik
In Finnish and Lettish
And Bashi-Bazouk,
Who can barrack and blare in
The Magyar “bat,”
Finds something unfair in
Such treatment as that.
No net from Greek islands
Could capture their fish;
They drew on the Highlands
To “bodyline” Kisch.
All tongues that are vulgar
He’ll readily yap,
From bothersome Bulgar
To musical Lapp.
Desirous to dump him
They’d find it a task
In Swedish to stump him
Or floor him in Basque.
But the Gaelic —or label
It Erse, if you wish —
Was meaningless babel
To erudite Kisch.

POLITICAL POINTS
The figure of Mercury between two
hemispheres looks out of place on the
G.P.O.’s Is. 6d. air-mail stamp. Shylock
would have been more at home there.
Or —having regard to the slowness of the
service—Pan, the god of cowherds and
drovers.
Lang Labor has been licked once more
—at the N.S.W. municipal elections this
time. It even lost seats in Paddington
to Federal Labor (that faction’s first suc-
cess), one of them being the Mayor’s.
Worse still, it was banged severely on the
Newcastle-Maitland coalfields, where Mr.
Badly hails from.
To the unconcealed disgust of a Labor
commentator, Adelaide’s out-of-works
are appointing an “organising secretary,”
at £3 3s. a week. Who or what he is
to organise is not stated, but presumably
he will be the only employed person in
the unemployed organisation.
Two unwelcome visitors to Australia
have highly appropriate names. Kisch—
an old form of the German Gisch —■
means froth, “hot air.” And a Griffin
in Asia is a mug newchum.
Poor old Ireland is to suffer another
felon blow from the Saxon, whose new
Lotteries Act puts a postal ban on the
Free State sweeps. Said the Oppressor’s
Home Secretary:
While it will not be an offence to send
to Ireland for a lottery ticket, letters con-
taining lottery tickets will be stopped.
Still, there are ways of getting round
such regulations, as Mr. de Valera will
discover if he communicates with
Hobart.
Garden, in the Reps.:
I shall elsewhere point out to the un-
employed and to the working classes in
this country that Parliament, as it operates
at present, is a sham, a delusion and a
snare.
It would be interesting to know which of
the three Garden, as an M.P., considers
himself.
At a meeting of the Empire Parlia-
mentary Association, McKell, Lang’s last
Minister of Justice, raised as “an Empire
problem” the question of whether the
Governor had acted constitutionally in
sending Lang and co. to the country. The
only overseas delegate who rose to the
bait was for the Governor; but in the
retrospect what does it matter? The
electors were nearly 4 to 1 against Lang,
and they are the only people who count.
The Grenadier Guards Band gave six
performances in Queensland, and during
one a taxgatherer arrived with an assess-
ment of £1 for each bandsman. Forgan
Smith —seemingly anxious to show that
he is more Ostrellyan than the Ostrell-
yans—approves of the boorish exaction.
The bandmaster’s comment was that
“Brisbane folk are fine people afflicted
with a number of parish Bumbles.”
True, no doubt, but people expected
something apter from a member of the
army that has always sworn horribly
in Flanders.
“Subyacker”: There’s a bigger job
waiting for Comrade Forgie Smith. This
here Duke gets a thousand quid a month,
wrung out of the mouths of the starvin’
workers in England. What right has he
got to come inter Australia without pay-
in’ his income tax, like the other capi-
talists? If Forgie don’t sool Magee on
to that Duke for income tax he’ll hear
about it.
Mrs. Longman, delegate to the
Women’s Congress at Melbourne,
pointed out the amazing fact that, though
Australia was the first country to give
women a vote, only five women have
been elected to its Parliaments in 34
years. Yet the Women’s National League
is possibly the most powerful factor in
Australian politics. The explanation is
a sex, not a political, one. Women will
work in concert under sincere direction ;
but the moment it comes to trusting
one of their own number they lack faith.
A commission set up by President
Roosevelt has made some rather start-
ling recommendations:
Elimination of the tariff on non-competi-
tive imports; lowering of other duties under
proper safeguards; no discrimination
against Oriental immigrants; co-operation
with the League in “activities which cannot
involve us in European conflicts”; and set-
tlement of war debts, the U.S.A. to
assume liability for debts repudiated by
States before the Civil War.
One difficulty in the way of a debts
settlement on this basis is that the un-
satisfied creditors of the States in default
(their heirs, rather) are private persons,
and the war obligations of Britain are
a Government matter. Nevertheless, even
the proposal for a settlement on this
basis is a step forward.
The Wyangala dam was built in the

guaranteed by the British and Common-
wealth Governments. Lang was getting
some of the money at 2 p.c. when he re-
fused to pay Bull 3 p.c. Minister Main
now says the thing cost £1,750,000, and
is “years before its time.” The Govern-
ment can’t use Wyangala water for irri-
gation blocks without interfering with
the water rights of existing Lachlan
settlers, and won’t utilise it for a new
wheat settlement at Roto (sandy country
with a 7in. rainfall), though that was the
original demented intention. In short,
this “cheap money” is going to be dashed
dear.
Westralia’s “Mirror” has been looking
up the record of one Scott, who pleaded
guilty at Sydney to a foul offence on a
child at Queanbeyan. It finds that he
was sentenced to death 25 years ago
for the murder of his paramour at
Meekatharra; she was found dying with
eleven knife-wounds in her body. The
verdict was upheld on appeal, but the
sentence was commuted to imprisonment
for “life” —actually 15 years. For the
Queanbeyan beastliness, though the
murder conviction was mentioned before
sentence was passed, the ruffian got two
years, and will probably be out in 18
months or so. No doubt he will remain
in N. S. Wales. Bennett, another “lifer”
from Westralia, prematurely released,
incautiously migrated from N. S. Wales
to Victoria, where, resuming his degen-
erate practices, he was hanged.
Archie Galbraith Cameron, C.P. mem-
ber for Barker (S.A.), who was a 27th
Battalion Digger for three years, tried
last week to move for the expulsion of
the Moscow pilgrim Garden on a ques-
tion of privilege. First the Speaker said
he could, then the Speaker said he
couldn’t; and the Government blew hot
and the Government blew cold; so
Cameron, who had come armed with a
full and particular history of Garden’s
career as Communist, had to sit down.
He made no effort to conceal his aston-
ishment and disgust. But that’s the
U.A.P. all over. Not without brains or
heart, but wanting when moral courage
is required. In these matters particu-
larly, cold from the feet to the liver,
and that turns white.
A member of the Government which
trembles at the thought of challenging
Garden’s competency to sit had Hugh
Mahon put' out of Parliament. Yet
Mahon was an original M.H.R. and had
served in three Cabinets. He was actu-
ally War Minister for just on two years,
and two sons were in the A.l.F.—one
was a Fifth Division gunner. And no
one ever accused Mahon of being a Red
revolutionary or of being “under any
acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience
or adherence to a foreign Power....or
entitled to the rights and privileges of a
citizen of a foreign Power.” Cameron
ought to move that, in view of the Gov-
ernment’s attitude to Garden, the reso-
lution expelling Mahon be expunged
from the records of the House.
Queensland Main Roads Commission
has given an interesting illustration of
the value of aerial survey in opening up
rough country. The Culpa area, 70 miles
south of Cairns and 120 miles north of
Townsville, contains some 55,000 acres
of promising land at an altitude of from
2500 feet to 3000 feet, mostly dense tropi-
cal jungle. From the air a natural
access to Ravenshoe via the Tully Falls
was rapidly worked out, and a road is
already under construction into the
centre of the new country. Total cost
of survey was £2 a square mile, as com-
pared with £49 a square mile for a
ground party. Similar methods are to
be used in opening up the heavy jungle
country beyond the Daintree.
In one way and another Lang has been
a goldmine to the N.S.W. Bar. He
figured last week in two cases which had
reached the High Court, one being
A. C. Willis’s libel action against him,
arising out of the Bulli by-election. At
the jury trial Lang was declared the
winner, but on appeal to the Full Court
two Justices found that learned-brother
James, now deceased, had misdirected
the jury, and two High Court Justices
were of the same opinion, Starke, J., say-
ing that Willis had been “denied justice
according to law, not only in form but in
substance.” But Justices Rich, Evatt and
McTiernan thought differently, and their
view prevailed. Verdict for the defen-
dant ; plaintiff to pay all the costs. They
were as close as brothers once.
The other case in which Lang was
concerned related to a Government
advertising contract he gave to K. E.
Bardolph, then of the Lang “party” in
Adelaide —this when he had defaulted
on interest, was not paying pen-
sioners and was about £12,000,000
behind on the current year’s trans-
actions. Bardolph was promised £lll4
10s. for advertising the N. S. Wales
Tourist Bureau in a little paper he runs.
Perhaps Stevens should have sought
legislative sanction for deducting the
money from Lang’s salary. Instead, he
tried to have the contract annulled, and
failed, with costs.
In a statement regarding the demoli-
tion of Melbourne slums Premier Argyle
defined a slum as a building where
the housing facilities are insufficient.
Such a definition narrows down the slum
area considerably.
There are not many
buildings in the south-
ern metropolis where
overcrowding exists,
and many of these are
solidly constructed
places which require
little alteration or no
alteration at all. The
popular definition of a
slum is a place unfit for
human habitation ac-
cording to modern
ideas of sanitation.
Chapman, the imported secretary of
the A.R.U., has presented a gloomy re-
port on Labor in Britain, which he has
just visited. Men associated with mili-
tant unions are considered there as un-
touchables. The only person who made
a speech worth while at the British
Trade Union Congress was an Indian.
But (of course!) real progress is being
made in the U.S.S.R.
“El V.”: History plays strange pranks.
Reading a pile of French Revolutionary
documents for 1795, I came across the
manifesto of a committee which had
shot up in Amsterdam. After congratu-
lating the burghers in Lenin-like language
on their rescue from “tyranny” and salut-
ing the revolution it named deputies to
form the equivalent of a Soviet. The last
name on the list is J. van Lang!

The only centenarian presented to the
Duke in Australia was Mrs. Musgrave, of
Auburn (N.S.W.). She was born before
George IV. died, and has lived accord-
ingly in the reigns of five British sover-
eigns. She met the Duke on her 105th
birthday.
Merle Robertson, the pianist, is back
in Adelaide after nine years in New
York. Her younger brother Valdemar
has won the Wesley scholarship at the

Vance Palmer’s Queensland admirers
have presented his portrait by Colin
Colahan to Brisbane Art Gallery. It
hangs opposite the lately-bequeathed
Lucrece. Members of the g.p. will won-
der who the bronzed young man with
the far-away eyes, blue shirt and
Bohemian tie is. His name isn’t to be
seen —and neither is that of the artist.
Alex. Melrose is donating the long-
needed £lO,OOO extension to Adelaide Art
Gallery. He is in the sixties and unmar-
ried, a lawyer (a partner of Homburg,
S. Attorney-General), an uncle of the
airman, author of a recent book of light
verse (he has been a Bulletin con-
tributor for many years), member of the
Public Library Board, founder of the
NORMAN BROOKES, president of the Vic
L.T.A.
Melrose portrait prize and a donor of
pictures to the Art Gallery. This is the
first large private gift to the Art Gallery
since those of pastoralist Thomas Elder
at the end of last century and Dr.
Morgan Thomas at the beginning of this.
Charlie Nuttall, who has died in Mel-
bourne, aged 62, was an artist and an
author, and he drifted into broadcasting
—very successfully—-late in life. Trained
at the National Gallery, he went to U.S.A.
and worked on the N.Y. “Herald” for five
years. His best-known picture shows the
opening of the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment, reproductions being in all official
places. He was never proud of this
directory in pictorial form.
Canon Garnsey, elected last week to
Sydney Uni. Senate, is a product of
Sydney Grammar who captained his
school and ’Varsity at cricket, scoring
97 runs against Melbourne Uni. in his
last match. He graduated before the
institution of Rhodes scholarships, but
his son David lifted one. As warden of
St. Paul’s, Garnsey has demonstrated the
fallacy of sending to England for Angli-
can clerics. He once upset the Prohibi-
tionists by suggesting that beer in reason-
able quantities was good for working
folk.
Lawrence Campbell, who last week
was entertained by pupils, old and new,
and handed a presentation by one of
them (Premier Stevens), is one of Sydney’s
most familiar identities. The stocky little
Scot with the formidable eyebrows has
been teaching elocution for 40 years.
Hundreds of politicians, including the
N. S. Wales Premier and several of his
Ministers, got their platform manners
and methods from him. He has no poli-

candidates whom he instructed in the
most effective and articulate means of
putting across their attacks on each
other.
“Makarini’s” correction:
lan Coster (B. 14/11 /’34) never edited the
Auckland “Sun.” Percy Crisp did, and it
was not his fault that it foundered. Crisp is
now a utility man on London “Daily Express.”
Coster went from “Nash’s Magazine” to the
“Sunday Dispatch,” and from the “Dispatch”
to the “Evening Standard” as feature-writer
at £l5OO a year. He covered the launching of
the Queen Mary for the “Evening Standard”
in a signed article to which much prominence
was given, and at 31 appears to be one of the
rising young men of London journalism.
An impression by Finey
of perhaps the most artis-
tic tennis player of all
time. As president of the
Victorian L. T. Assoc.,
Norman Brookes still
keeps in touch with the
game, but as a Melbourne
commercial magnate he
can’t spare the time he did
before the war; also he
has become a golfer. He
and his son-in-law Gen-
goult' Smith had as much
to do with making the cen-
tenary celebrations a suc-
cess as any two men in
Victoria.
News comes from Dur-
ban of the death of Frank
Greig. His father made a
fortune as a Melbourne
tea-importer, but dropped it
in the bank smashes. Frank
fought with the N. S.
Wales contingent in the
Boer War, retired with
the rank of captain, mar-
ried Florence Perry, of
the D’Oyly Carte Opera
Co., and took up sugar-
planting at Umhlali, near
Durban. He made a big
success of planting, but
his heart was in the stage.
A family trait. In Mel-
bourne he and his sisters
Edith and Mary used to
be famous as amateurs;
Laurie Greig acted in
many J.C.W. dramas, and
another brother, Bob (known to movie
fans in butler parts), is now playing a
stage role in the West End of London.
The Greigs’ mother was a sister of the
late W. B. Dailey, of N. S. Wales.
Doug Nicholls, the only abo. in the
Victorian League—he plays wing for
Fitzroy—is taking on mission work for
the Church of Christ. Nicholls comes
from Warrnambool, and was for some
time associated with the abo. mission
station at Cummerajunja. He is a fine,
fair footballer and a cultivated speaker ;
he gave about the best address of the day
at the last Church of Christ gathering at
Melbourne Town Hall.
Eric Shigh Smith, who died at his desk
in the office of the Newcastle “Morning
Herald,” was secretary of the original
Repatriation Committee. It did a lot
of useful work in N.S.W. before Repat.
took over the job. A cousin of “F.E.,”
who became Lord Birkenhead, Eric was
an intensely loyal Englishman, but per-
haps his chief love was Sydney. He
week-ended there regularly from New-
castle, and never missed a chance to visit
it when he was on Brisbane “Courier.”
Frith drove to Horsley
to caricature F. S. Hibble,
who shares the Vic. cen-
tenary novel prize with
Vance Palmer. Horsley,
according to Mr. Hibble,
who helps his wife to look
after the post office there,
is exactly 25 miles from
the centre of Sydney;
Frith’s calculation is seven
hours. The newly-arrived
novelist took to writing as
a recreation owing to mis-
fortune ; he was crippled
by influenza in the 1919
epidemic. The Endeavour
Press is publishing his
book.
“Inaha”: Ray White-
head may have got his
idea of ’planing the Tas-
man from his friend Guy
Menzies, the only lad to
fly the 1200 miles alone.
Whitehead could have
dropped into a cushy job
in his father’s Wellington
(M.L.) drapery, but he
preferred to take up a
short - service commission
in the R.A.F. He served
with No. 32 (Fighter)
Squadron. Early last year
he returned to Maoriland
and took out a commer-
cial pilot’s license. Plans
to go “ferrying” ’planes in
China fell through, and he
ran an air-taxi service in
Sydney with the Puss
Moth which he christened
Faith in New Zealand for
the Tasman flight. His Wellington
friends remember him as a reporter on
the “Dominion.”
“El V.”: Leslie Hinks, killed in an
aeroplane in N. S. Wales during a dasfi
from W.A. to the funeral of his son, was
a contradictory character. A lean, phy-
sically hard engineer with unbounded
energy and a keen nose for a financial
proposition, he was fascinated by the
occult. He once conducted a volumi-
nous correspondence with Marie Corelli
on the hereafter. Everything he touched
turned to money. He was in the
Mt. Morgan revival and several West-
ralian shows; he built tin-hare courses
and many blocks of flats (Green-
knowe in Sydney belonged to him); land
deals and motor-cars interested him. He
had complete confidence in his luck.
And in one and the same week his son
was accidentally electrocuted, his wife
became seriously ill and he was killed.
Count Metternich, who has died in
Berlin, was one of the few German Am-
bassadors in London who thoroughly
understood the British mind. He warned
the Kaiser many times that Von Tirpitz’s
naval policies would lead to a war in
which Germany might be ruined, and
so incurred the hatred of the militarists.
He was highly esteemed both at Court
and the Foreign Office, but his allegedly
defeatist' views eventually put him out
of favor everywhere, and he was super-
seded by Von Marschall. Metternich
was a descendant of the Austrian diplo-
matist who first helped Napoleon to
marry Marie Louise, and then joined the
British and Prussians against him.
J. S. Badger, dead in California, at 83,
resembled a benign caricature of Uncle
Sam. He came to Brisbane in 1895 to
help instal the electric tramways, person-
ally drove the first tram (in Adelaide-
street) and stayed on as manager for
quarter of a century. In 1912 his refusal
to allow trammies to wear union badges
on their uniforms led to a general strike.
A quiet, cultivated American whose
kindly deeds belied the straight set of
his mouth, Badger went back to America
when the tramways were taken over by
the Government.
F. S. HIBBLE, of N.S. Wales, who takes half the
Vic. centenary novel prize.
“Old Hand”: Saidee, daughter of the
late Alfred Stephen, C.J. and Lieut.-
Governor of N. S. Wales, died last week,
aged 90. Her twin, Alice, predeceased
her, and a younger sister, Mrs. Monty
Severn, died a few months ago. The
longevity and mental alertness of the
Stephens are proverbial, and Miss Saidee
was remarkable even for a Stephen. At
85 she could quote classical passages in
five different languages, and she used to
recall facts about friends of her
father who had been dead for over half
a century. During most of her life she
was a strenuous worker for the orphans’
School of Industry which her mother
founded.
Lindsay Bernard Hall, director of Vic-
toria’s National Gallery, has held the
Swanston-street fort against modernist
wreckers and radical painters of all de-
nominations since 1892, and would do so
if they came with bombs instead of can-
vases. Although Hall won’t have icono-
clasm as regards the art of his own day,
he has bought works of dead artists who
were iconoclastic in theirs, and these
form the chief glories of the National
collection. For the rest he remains faith-
ful to the respectable traditions of the
Royal Academy, where he exhibited be-
fore he came to Australia. Let it go
to his credit that he has always insisted
on the integrity of the artist, has scorned
potboiling and has jumped firmly on
those who regard ignorance of craftsman-
ship as no bar to self-expression. He
has brought to Australia three of its
finest examples of sculpture—Rodin’s—
and four or five of its best paintings.

of Replacement and Depreciation Fund.
Last week reserves were in eruption
again, £5,850,000 of bonus scrip having
fallen into shareholders’ pockets, thus
doubling paid capital, a compressed his-
tory of which follows:
Cash-paid capital.. .. .. £2,425,000
Bonus capital .. .. .. 13,175,000
Total scrip issued .. .. £15,600,000
Capital'returned .. .. 3,900,000
Leaving . . . . . . £11,700,000
To provide the last gift £1,067,000 was
transferred from the reserve fund (re-
ducing it to £400,000), £883,000 came
from an undisclosed source (probably
suspense accounts, £2,337,375, down
£882,913) and the book value of some of
the assets was written up £3,957,564.
There will thus be £57,564 to spare, in-
cluding which visibly free reserves have
been reduced to £845,269. But this is
not the only prop for capital. There is
the replacement and depreciation fund
(£3,029,038), some or all of which may
be genuine profit, and the suspense
accounts are largely provision for con-
tingencies which may never occur ; also,
after revaluation, the book value of capi-
tal assets provides a margin for reserve,
the chairman says.
In 1931 refineries and mills stood in
the books at about half replacement
value. Over the 12 months to Sept. 30
last £3,165,010 net' was added to their
book value:

The amount coming to sundry creditors
was nearly three times covered by cash,
etc., alone. Book debts, etc., up
£1,040,909, include a large but unspeci-
fied amount of investments.
As for dividends, which have been
steady at \2\ p.c. since the end of Sep-
tember, 1921, the declared intention
is to pay 6| p.c. p.a., with a bit
extra in Nov., 1935, so that shareholders
may suffer no inconvenience in connec-
tion with taxation on the new bonus
scrip. The market, with one eye on the
past, takes a long look into the future
with the other and prices the fully-paid
£2O shares at £40 —they shot up from £66
in Sept, to £BO before the gift. At £4O
the return is 3.1 p.c. on a 6i p.c. div.
basis ; the investor who looks for 4 p.c.
on his money counts on an 8 p.c. distri-
bution. The £940,171 netted for the 12
months to Sept. 30 was 8 p.c. on capital
as it now stands.
The co.’s earnings are derived from
milling and refining, etc., in Australia,
growing and milling in Fiji, refining in
Maoriland, and from a wad of invest-
ments outside the business. As agent for
the Queensland Government it receives
£4 3s. Id. per ton of sugar melted in
Australia. For this payment it finances
purchase of the season’s crop (at present
worth about £12,000,000), handles, re-
fines, distributes and sells the sugar con-
sumed in Australia, makes all arrange-
ments for disposal overseas of the sur-
plus production, and meets the cost of
administration, etc. According to the
1931 Sugar Inquiry Committee’s report,
the co.'s total profits from the Australian
sugar industry were:
licfiu inf? and services under .agreement
(1929) £400,000
Milling (average 1928-30) .. .. .. 201,000
Export to islands (1929) . . .. . . 8,000
Total £609,000
Income tax .. .. .. .. .. 137,026
Net profit £471,975
The £471,975 was 5| p.c. on the written-
down value of the fixed assets plus value
of average stocks involved. It was a
moderate return in the boom days, and
is not excessive now, nor is the existence
of large reserves now detrimental from
the consumer’s point of view.

There is no price-cutting in the trade.
For the most part competition takes the
form of buying up hotel freeholds, thus
widening and anchoring turnover. This
Tooth’s has done on a wholesale basis.
It took over large and thirsty territories
when it bought Castlemaine and Wood
Bros. (Newcastle) in 1920, and Mahon
(Wagga) and Lincoln (Narrandera) in
1924. Five years later Resch’s business
(one of the two other big city breweries)
was welded into the organisation. This
involved the issue of 1,250,000 paids, lift-
ing capital to £5,620,598, of which
£2,150,097 had come largely from hidden
reserves; the last £1,262,597 of it was
scattered during the three years to the
close of accounts in 1929. Three years
after that the State’s consumption of
beer had fallen by nearly 40 p.c., and
a crop of other difficulties appeared. Still,
the distribution to shareholders, which
had reached 124 p.c. in ’2B, dropped no
lower than 8 p.c.; and as conditions
improved it began to climb again.
During the last term there was a sharp
spring of £158,516 in gross earnings, due
largely to Government and public body
spending and growth in employment:

1934.. 1,237,497 670,378 54.1 567,119
The net result benefited by £84,915 of
the increase, reaching a wink over 10
p.c. on capital as against 8.5, 8.3, 8.5,
12.2, 14.7 and 15.2 p.c. back to 1928.
Shareholders got an extra 1 p.c., making
94 p.c. for the year, the final being at
the rate of 10 p.c. p.a.
Though the outlook is not so clear as
it might be, the market, which sees no
cloud in the co.’s sky, prices the pound
shares at 51s. as against 435. a year ago
and 17s. lOd. in 1931. At 51s. the return
is 3.9 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The
cover is visibly 235. 4d. in net tangibles.
Finances are snug:

With more being put by than is distri-
buted, and with reserves visibly £301,968
in excess of the half-million of paid capi-
tal, of which £425,000 has come from
surplus earnings, it is little wonder that
the market discounts the future by pay-
ing 755. for the pound shares —they
could be had at 565. a couple of years
ago. The return at 755. is 2.6 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. div. basis, or 3.3 p.c. on a 12i
p.c. distribution. The year’s net return
from all sources was 21 p.c. on capital
as against 20.6, 17.8, 15.1, 12.4, 20.5 and
25.1 p.c. back to 1928. Interest and
rents alone (£63,060, down £1468) were
equal to 12.6 p.c. on capital. Still, the
div. was kept at 10 p.c. ; it had been
sweetened with a 2} p.c. bonus for 16
years to the close of accounts in '29.
During the year a branch was set up
at Vancouver, and agencies were opened
at Madagascar and Trinidad, business in
the Malay States and Ceylon improved,
thanks to the better tone in the tea and
rubber markets, and conditions in Aus-
tralia and Maoriland were better, too.

Claims made off with an extra 225. of
each £lOO of net premiums; but the
larger business was handled at 30s. per
cent, less cost. The underwriting sur-
plus (£42,007) was thus £3178 better at
8.4 p.c. on capital. Curtailment of its
London marine risks has done the co. no
harm.
Policy-holders are strongly protected,
as they always have been. When the
books closed they could see net tangibles
equal to 287 p.c. of the year’s net pre-
miums, whereas 150 p.c. is usually con-
sidered adequate. And assets are a solid

The outlay on prospecting and develop-
ment (£14,120 last year) and provision
for depreciation (£18,360) are included
with profits and then shown as written
off in the table. Allowing for this and
minor reserve adjustments, the year’s net
earnings were £6492 as against £49,287
for the previous term. The amount re-
ceived in dividends was £54,835. With-
out allowing for any exes, on this
account, the loss on mining was £48,343,
due to (1) suspension of production and
treatment for 12 weeks, and (2) the con-
tinued fall in the price of copper. The
stoppage was due to shortage of power,
brought about by low rainfall (the low-
est for 40 years) causing a severe curtail-
ment of the water supply to the co.’s Mt.
Margaret hydro-electric plant.
The inevitable consequences were re-
duction of output and a sharp rise in
unit costs. Including prospecting, de-
velopment and depreciation charges, the
all-in cost of producing and realising a
ton of copper was £59 os. 6d. last year
as against £5l 4s. Bd. for the previous
one. Deducting the value of the gold
and silver content, the net cost was
£52 19s. lid. and £46 6s. 9d. respectively.
In terms of Australian currency, the
London average price for electrolytic was
£43 9s. lid. and £46 Is. 3d. over the
same periods; in 1929 the figure ex-
ceeded £B3.

production figures:—■

The plant has a capacity of about 13,000
tons of copper per annum. While work
was in progress last year, there was a
continued reduction of costs ; it was out-
lay duriqg the non-productive period that
bumped up the final costs figure.
A feature of the year’s work was the
proving and partial opening up of the
large low-grade deposit in the West

The outlook for shareholders is brighter
than at' any time since 1928, when the co.
was formed to take over Tasmanian
Cement Pty.’s business and a large shale
deposit at Latrobe (Tas.). The cement
side of the undertaking appears to have
made steady progress from the start,
despite curtailment of public and other
expenditure on construction work. It
was in a commendable effort to develop
the shale-oil business that the co. met
with trouble. When the shale deposit
was sold about three years ago, for
£14,000 in Tasmanite Shale Oil scrip, the
immediate loss on the deal was £28,534.
To wipe out this loss, together with
£16,000 of preliminary exes., and write
£11,200 off the book value of sharehold-
ings and £29,552 off plant, 6s. Bd. per
share (= £85,286) was lopped off the
ords. That reduced paid capital to
£295,266, of which £143,092 is pref.
money now carrying a fixed cumulative
7 p.c. as against 8 p.c. previously.
Earnings have kept step with the im-
provement in conditions generally, and,
with the dead wood out of the accounts,
the co. has been able to make a very
attractive showing. Last year’s net earn-
ings (up £9279) were enough to pay the
pref. div. and show 18.1 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 12.8 p.c. in the pre-
vious term, and the div. was lifted from
2\ p.c. to 10 p.c.

Includes silver values converted into gold.
The spring in the latest figures is due
mainly to the starting up of No. 3 dredge
on the Bulowat' area in November, 1933.
The average amount of gravel handled
per day per dredge was 7.184 c.y., and
the average working cost, excluding
royalty and amortisation, 9.15 cents per
yard. Gold is reckoned at $35 per
ounce throughout. After paying royalty
($149,221) and sending $150,000 to the
amortisation reserve ($300,000), the co.
netted $2,085,699. Two divs. of 60 cents
each took $918,000 ; another of 90 cents
will be paid next month. No. 4 dredge
set in early in August last, and reached
bedrock by the end of the month.
When the books closed, paid capital
figured at $3,825,000, since increased to
$4,575,000 by the issue of 150,000 shares
of $5 each to Placer Development as
part consideration for the Bulowat-Burn-
side property. There was $158,130 com-
ing to sundry creditors; more or less
liquids totalled $1,381,212. The proper-
ties were in at $2,530,760; plant, etc.,
$4,150,331 ; other assets, $40,458.
Apart from deep gravels, the combined
Bulolo-Bulowat area is estimated to con-
tain 95,000,000 c.y. to a depth of around
22ft., averaging 50 cents, of which 38
cents is reckoned as working profit. This
is equivalent to 1,031,4280 z. of gold, or
over $36,000,000. Deep drilling, thus far
confined to the upper half of the original
Bulolo area, has proved between 70 and
100 million yards of 25-cent to 40-cent
dirt. The average value will depend
upon the digging depth finally decided
upon, which is likely to be between 75ft.
and 125 ft. Additional dredges will be
installed to handle these deeper gravels.
On the Australian market the fully-
paid $5 shares are priced at £8 10s.
At the Black Jack, Charters Towers
(Q-)> _ the face in the south drive is
showing 2ft. 6in. of mineralised stone,
assaying £l2 13s. per ton. The face
in the north drive shows a small
leader on the hanging wall, with a new
make of promising stone on the footwall.
A crushing of 89 tons of stone from the
mine recently yielded 520 z. 7dwt. of gold
over the plates. About five tons of slimes
is to be sent to Chillagoe for treatment;
the sands are still to come.

United Options, Ltd., Mt. Perry dis-

shafts and th'e cutting of the lode by a
tunnel.

Kamerunga Mines, near Cairns (N.Q.),
has been' taken under option by the
Australian Mining Trust. Prospecting
work to a depth of 100 ft. indicates a reef
averaging about 4ft. thick. Prospective
ore supplies appear to be large. Several
hundred tons of stone in past crushing
averaged around Bdwt.

During the 12 months to the end of
March last, Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd.
(W.A.), whose £1,200,000 of share capi-
tal is held by Wiluna Gold Corp.
(London), treated 469,362 tons of crudes
(426,840 tons for the preceding 15
months), worth £999,808 (Australian cur-
rency). Arsenic and other receipts lifted
total revenue to £1,000,299, of which
£410,452 was net profit as against
£268,836 for the previous term. Two
divs., totalling 9s. per share, called for
£540,000. Monthly production advanced
from 33,000 tons at the beginning to
41,000 tons at the end of the year. Ex-
cluding exploration and development
charges, working costs fell from 18s. 7.5 d.
to 16s. 8.5 d. per ton of ore treated over
the same period. Developments at depth
on the east (main) lode are satisfactory.
Here the diamond-drill has shown the
gold-carrier to be big and payable at a
vertical depth of 1500 ft. No. 1 west lode
gives indications of weakness at lower
levels, while No. 2 west lode continues
to improve at depth.

Associated Northern (W.A.) had a roll-
up in London the other day. Among
other things, chairman John Wadding-
ton mentioned that the £10,500 received
for the Iron Duke, at Kalgoorlie, had
been invested in sound securities, which,
in addition to returning the co. a steady
income, had already shown some capital
appreciation. The market value of the
co.’s investments (£38,814) was £4859
more than their book value. The Gimlet,
at Ora Banda, has been sold for £7500
cash, plus a 15 p.c. fully-paid share in-
terest in any co. formed to work it. The
board proposes to secure interests in any
new shows which are considered promis-
ing enough in Westralia or elsewhere.
* * * . *
Triton (W.A.) proposes to instal a
treatment -plant of about 5000 tons a
month capacity, and to start gold pro-
duction in July, 1935. If Westralian
shareholders had had their way, the mine
would have been on the producing list
before now. Unnecessary delay, they
say, has been caused by giving attention
to the southern and erratic gold-bearing
section of the property instead of con-
centrating on the northern block, where
a good deal of wealth has been proved
to 300 ft. and there are indications that
payable stuff lives beneath.
* * * *
Westralia is elated and beflagged at
the prospect of the American Smelting
and Refining Corporation of New York
coming in. This big concern holds an
option from Herman Mandelstam over
the Big Bell, near Cue, together with
1200 acres surrounding it. Boring over
the last year or two has proved the exist-
ence of a large auriferous formation. If
further prospecting does not reduce the
average grade below 3|dwt. per ton, the
Americans say they will spend £200,000
on development and equipment, and join
the list of Westralian gold producers.
Years ago the late Dorrie Doolette tried
to make the Big Bell pay at the statutory
price of gold, but didn’t meet with much
success.

Gold Fields Aust. Development has
decided to increase its capital to £500,000
by the creation of 200,000 new pound
shares, which are offered to those on the
register in the proportion of one for one.
The co. was formed in London in Nov.,
1932, with the backing of New Consoli-
dated Goldfields and a few big Anglo-
Australian investors to take over from
Claude de Bernales the Moonlight and
other groups at Wiluna, as well as a
few other auriferous ventures in the
West It has since bought an inter-
est in Western Mining Corp. and
taken a few options, some of which have
been added to the list of assets sold or
abandoned.
* * * *
The B.A.N.Z. Co., which is reopening
several leases to the north of the Croesus
Prop., Kalgoorlie (W.A.), has struck a
new lode on the 150 ft. level at Borg’s
shaft; this lode has been driven on for
100 ft. Another promising formation has
been encountered in Parker’s shaft, and
a wide make of stone has also been met
with in the Ironsides West shaft.
* * * *
John Waddington, chairman, and
Claude de Bernales, managing director,
both reckon that, given the expected con-
tinuity at depth of the ore-bodies in size
and value, Murchison Gold Develop-
ment is likely to be an important and
profitable gold producer. The chairman
adds that the co. has £lOO,OOO (Aus-
tralian currency) of its capital on fixed
deposit with a Perth bank.
* * * *
After pocketing the proceeds from a
small final crushing, the vendors of First
Hit goldmine (W.A.) have walked out,
and the First Hit Co. has walked in. At
the moment the mine appears to be a bit
small in relation to the amount of capi-
tal issued.
* * * *
Edna May (W.A.) has decided to equip
its property with an all-electric plantr
Orders have been placed for three oil
engines, alternators, compressors and a
winding unit. Tenders have also been
called for pumping equipment; a per-
manent station to be installed at the
bottom level of the mine. Ore from the
Central and Consolidated areas is to be
attacked by extension of the lower levels
of the Edna May shaft.
* * * *
A Sydneysider has taken options oyer
five leases at the new find, near Yerilla
(W.A.), discovered by an abo. named
Sullivan. The leases are held by a syn-
dicate of three whites, Sullivan and his
wife, and a deposit of £lOOO has been
paid. The purchase price is £lO,OOO, and
the option is for nine months. An Adel-
aide co. has also taken an option over
a block adjoining these leases for a
deposit' of £5OO.
* * * *
At the end of October Western Queen
G.M. Co., which is testing a property on
the Murchison field (W.A.), held approxi-
mately £39,000 of its £50,000 of capital
in cash. The objective is the 200 ft. level,
and a new shaft had been sunk 93ft. of
the distance at Oct. 27. The option ex-
pires in April next, and the purchase
consideration is £20,000 cash plus
£lO,OOO in paids.
* * * *
Westralia’s gold production for this
year is expected to reach 650,0000 z., or
about 13,0000 z. more than in 1933.
Assisted by new additions to the list and
increases from those already on it, pro-
duction in 1935 should get a bigger lift.
The State’s total gold output to date is
valued in Australian currency at
£182,255,000.

The All-Weather Driving Belt
CHROMOL
Waterproof
Cemented
When it is impossible to
avoid outdoor drives, or
to protect belting from
exposure to the weather
or unusual operating con-
ditions, it is then that
Chromol, the Super All-
Weather Driving Belting,
proves its sterling worth.
asd
Damp, steamy or dust-laden atmo-
spheres, scorching sun or drying
winds cannot lessen the efficiency of
Chromol Belting. Chromol is speci-
ally tanned to meet just such condi-
tions and is thoroughly waterproof
cemented, so that even immersion in
water cannot harm it.
Apart from these outstanding features,
however, the amazing gripping power
and pliability of Chromol Belting
make it particularly desirable where
drives are subject to sudden starting
shocks, heavy or variable loads, or
where high pulley ratios and angle or
cross drives are encountered.

“Murder in the Private Car”
In this extravaganza at the St. James
the devices for making the blood freeze
which have become stereotypes in the
hands of Edgar Wallace’s imitators are
amusingly burlesqued. Mary Carlisle,
telephonist, learns that she is heiress to
the Carson millions, and kidnappers im-
mediately get to work. Charles Ruggles,
deprecatory yet persistent in the role of
crime-deflector, frustrates their first at-
tempt; and, though repeatedly flung out,
he keeps reappearing in the private car
which bears the heroine later to her
father. Una Merkel, as Mary Carlisle’s
friend, is again a hard-boiled yet very
feminine woiking-goil. She and Ruggles
learn to love each other as the car tears
across America to the accompaniment of
screams from the ladies, clutching hands,

Two Faces,” at Sydney Capitol.
opening panels, failing lights, a gibber-
ing nigger, and the rest of the parapher-
nalia of movie horror.
There are many genuinely comic situa-
tions and lines. The animals break out
of a wayside menagerie, and a huge
gorilla and small black monkey board the
train. The gorilla, after doing its worst,
plunges through a window, and Ruggles
sees the monkey for the first time. “It’s
shrunk!” he gasps. In the midst of
the uproar, when the train is teeming
with intruders, a plaintive whine is heard
from Mary Carlisle: “An’ they call this
a private car!” Ruggles kept the audi-
ence in shrieks on Friday night, and he
hasn’t a drunk scene or a single sugges-
tive line. The photography of the climax
when the car bolts loaded with explosives
is exceptionally good.
“The Hide Out”
Also at the St. James. Robert Mont-
gomery is a flash young blackmailer
whom all the underworld girls love. So
when he arrives at Whitford Kane’s farm,
wounded and a fugitive from justice, and
meets Maureen O’Sullivan, the experi-
enced moviegoer knows what to expect.
Mr. Montgomery contorts his mouth with
his customary energy to express scorn
of danger, whimsical bewilderment at the
behavior of farm animals, the dawn of
true love, a regular guy’s anguish at being
pinched. Miss O’Sullivan is a busy,
innocent colleen who does devastating
things with her eyes and teeth, and is all
girlish merriment till such time as a pair
of sentimental cops call for Montgomery.
If Hollywood doesn’t stop using this plot
nothing is surer than that it will even-
tually form the basis of a Great Austra-
lian Romance with a reformed razor-
wielder as the youth who inspires a
cocky’s daughter with an abiding passion.
“365 Nights in Hollywood”
Almost every other racket in the
U.S.A. having been ransacked for
material, this talkie, in a desperate effort
to be original, exploits the school that
trains dupes for a screen career they are
never likely to embark upon. Grant
Mitchell is the proprietor of this acad-
emy ; James Dunn the broken-down
director who gives instruction. The goil
is Alice Faye, who looks like a twin sister
of Jean Harlow and croons even more
horribly. There is a great deal of
croonery, because J. Dunn gets a chance
to come back by filming a comic-opera
quickie, all in rhyme, all in jazz tempo
and running nineteen brassieres to the
sq. in. Rehearsals take almost as long
on the screen as they would in reality,
and, by the time the villains are foiled
and the fade-out comes on a great big
kiss, even the principals seem to be fed
up with the proceedings. At Sydney
Capitol.
“The Man with Two Faces”
A thriller which marrow-freezes on
unusually vigorous lines. The murder
victim, Louis Calhern, is a fiend in
human form, soft-voiced, deadly and a
hypnotist. His “slayer,” as he is referred
to in the newspaper headlines trans-
ferred to the screen, is the abrupt and
very capable E. G. Robinson, repre-
sented as a comedian of nation-wide
fame. To save his sister from her dread-
ful husband, E.G. disguises himself as
a Frenchman, decoys the fiend to a hotel
and puts prussic acid in his brandy. But
he leaves a false moustache lying around,
and the police have a very good recol-
lection of his performances in French
roles, so a detective invites him to come
round to the District-Attorney’s office
after the show. “How will I get on?”
asks Robinson. “Well,” says the Sher-
lock, “the D.-A. ain’t sheddin’ any tears
over the big stiff you bumped off, and
he’s a human-hearted guy. It’ll all de-
pend on what you say to the jury.” “Say
to them! ” says Robinson with deep unc-
tion. “I’ll break their hearts!” Quite
a neat curtain. Also at the Capitol.
“Turkey Time”
A Ben Travers comedy specially con-
structed for Tom Walls and Ralph Lynn,
with' the usual allocations of bedroom
scenes, lingerie displays and slapstickery.
It ripples along brightly with approxi-
mately six chuckles to the minute, and
every now, and then a littlei bit of
character-acting that hits the nail of
reality on the head. Walls is an ex-
rancher from Montana, and though it
has little effect on his accent he gets the
other essentials very neatly. Ralph Lynn,
eyeglass and all, is the same as ever.
Mary Brough is a bibulous landlady, and
a good deal of th'e humor is mildly Rabe-

Dickensian flavor, despite motor-cars and
bicycles, and the casting of the many
minor parts has been given much more
attention than in earlier Walls-Lynn
comedies. Pre-sh'own by Fox ; now at
Sydney State.
“Two Hearts in Waltz Time”
This Anglo-German musical sentimen-
tality at Melbourne Athenaeum indicates
that British directors know at least one
side of their business. While Hollywood
tickles the tired businessman with Mae
West, Jean Harlow and a wealth of femi-
nine curves, the shrewd Briton goes after
the businessman’s wife.
Carl Brisson is vain and beautiful
to nauseation point; he dimples
naturally, and he has a luscious voice.
Find a waltz tune for such a being, give
him a girl who is a fairly good singer
and actress but whose charfns are not
too dazzling, and it’s only a matter of
collecting the dividends. Carl will provide

The story is the usual high-speed love
affair. The device of making the girl
mistake the hero’s sister for a rival pro-
vides the counterplot. Australia’s old
friend and critic Oscar Asche lends
weight—plenty of it—as a theatrical
manager, and Francis Day is adequate as
the heroine.
“Strike It Rich”
A slapstick comedy of an out-of-date
British type. It should be marked by the
censor “Unfit for presentation to per-
sons over 10 years of age.” George Gee
is the star.
Some First Nights
Most impressive feature of the benefit
tattoo for the Grenadier Guards Band
at the Sydney. Showground was the enor-
mous crowd. The ground is so large that
on the first night the band was inaudible
to a considerable section of the audi-
ence, and when it moved temporarily
near this section applause was so frantic
that the band was still inaudible. Mili-
tary items, including displays by tanks
and anti-aircraft guns, were interesting,
and the “changing of the guard” cere-
mony was reproduced. But the pro-r
gramme dragged, and many left before
it was over. On tfre second night arrang-
ments were improved, the band playing
opposite each of the two big stands in
turn.

Those who missed “The Dubarry”
when it made its appearance in Sydney
early this year can repair the omission,
for it has returned to the Royal until the
Firm is ready to stage “Viktoria and
Her Hussar” at' the Castlereagh-street
house. Sylvia Welling again heads the
cast as the captivating dressmaker’s
daughter who won the notice of Louis
XV. John Dudley, Cecil Kellaway, Leslie
Holland, Jean Duncan and Richard Parry
are in the cast, and the settings and cos-
tumes are as fine and colorful as when
the play was last seen in Sydney.
* * *
Elgar was the sole item on the menu
at the second festival concert at Mel-
bourne Town Hall. He was served in
four guises— hors-d’oeuvres, roast, fish
and pudding. If the order seems strange
the meal was excellent. The “Pomp and
Circumstance” overture began the pro-
ceedings. The “Falstaff” symphonic
study was solid nutriment. Taking it in
the spirit in which it was meant, that is,
as a musical picture of a conversation
between Prince and knight and their sub-
sequent peregrinations through the streets
of London, it was full of literary interest.
Falstaff grunted, snored, sneezed and
shook with laughter, and finally died
babbling about his childhood. As music,
it may have had unity—Elgar was hardly
the sort of composer who would write
palpable nonsense —but a design so com-
plicated and enormous would be difficult
to grasp at a first sitting, and this was
the first performance in Australia, though
the music was composed in 1913. In
the “Sea Pictures,” first sung by Clara
Butt at the Norwich Festival in 1899,
Isabel Biddell once more aired her clean,
clear and warm contralto, and once more
it failed to make a deep impression on
the vast Town Hall auditorium chiefly
because the orchestral accompaniment
was too loud. Miss Biddell’s vocal
organ remained successfully afloat in
A. L. Gordon’s “The Swimmer,” how-
ever. A beautiful rendering of the
lovely “Enigma” variations crowned
Fritz Hart’s labors.
* * *
Natasha Bojkovich, the Serbian bal-
lerina who starred at the Melb. opening
of the Russian Ballet at the King’s, car-
ried much responsibility on her dainty
toes by reason of the absence through ill-
ness of Spessiva. She appeared in item
after item, and never faulted. The pro-
gramme opened with “The Magic Flute,”
and included “Sylphides” and the “Dance
of the Hours.” Great interest hinged on
Juliana Enakieva, the 14-year-old Bul-
garian flapper who has made her way
into adult company by force of sheer
merit. She was loudly cheered for her
“Pizzicato.” The enthusiasm of the first-
night audience indicates that the novelty
of a full-sized ballet is acceptable to
Melbourne.
The Independent Theatre players failed
to do justice to Elmer Rice’s “Counsellor-
at-law” at Sydney Savoy. The produc-
tion lacked the zest which marks Rice’s
study of a week in the life of an
American lawyer; at times it dragged
deplorably. Arthur Stoyles, as George
Simon, worked hard, but gave an uncon-
vincing performance. He had not the
poise and confidence of an accomplished
Ned Sparks in “Servants’ Entrance,” at
Sydney State.
lawyer. Peter Lightfoot was even more
callow in the part of John P. Tedesco,
his partner. Among the men, William
Hume, Donald McNiven, John Wynd-
ham, Stanley Hildebrandt and John
Alden fitted their parts better. The
women were far superior. Irene Thir-
kell contributed a quiet and human
study of a sensitive secretary. Eliza-
beth Sheldon, as the erring and heart-
less Cora, was no less satisfactory in a
glacial manner. Patricia Cole, who
played a candy-chewing telephone girl,
gave the audience some chuckles. Doris
Fitton produced the play.

A short pause
for a long Gin drink
The fresh aroma of crushed lemon, the tinkly clink of ice, a splash of
Vickers, the spurt of a syphon ... a delicious, cooling, invigorating
drink that will take the sting out of summer's heat.
The gin, of course, must be Vickers—its invigorating freshness and
palate-pleasing tang have made it the favourite since as lona aao
as 1750.

“Turoar”: Bluey bought a new suit
for the butchers’ picnic. Arrived at the
suburb where it was to be held, he put in
an hour or so at a pub and then decided
that it was time he presented himself at
the ground. Taking a short cut, he was
confronted by a fence with four nasty-
looking barb wires. He contemplated it
in a puzzled fashion ; then light came.
“Thought y’d got a mug in me, didn’-
cher?” he addressed the fence. “Goin’
ter tear me noo coat, wasn’cher? Well,
you ain’t the only clever coVe
round ’ere.” He took off his coat and
dropped it carefully on the safe side
of the barrier. “Think y’ll ’ave a go at
me waistcoat now, don’cher?” he de-
manded cunningly. “Thash where you
slip.” The vest accompanied the coat.
“An’ now you reckon y’ll git ’ome on
me strides? Well,” Blue sneered, “thash
where you come the gutser.” He solemnly
peeled off the trousers and placed them
gently beside his upper garments. Laugh-
ing at intervals, Bluey carefully nego-
tiated the fence, donned his clothes and
went on his way.

“Eureka”: Fair-haired people should
keep away from dogwood scrub when
it is in blossom. It brings a rash
out on the body and makes one feel
very sick. I have known dozens of
blondes (both sexes) who have suffered
in this manner simply by walking
through dogwood scrub.
* * * *
“Kent T.”: S. Aus. hasn’t deserved
the grasshopper invasion ; it has faith-
fully protected the ibis. About six miles
from Millicent, south-east S.A., in Lake
Bonney, is an island on which thousands
of ibises make their homes. In the nesting
season they build anywhere and every-
where, and so close together that they
must all be touching when sitting.
Creepers growing on rotting trees are
sufficient material, and it is rare to see
one nest with more eggs in it than an-
other. The birds gather most of their
food from the rich Millicent flats, where
they may be seen picking up grubs and
insects. A few go prospecting for
worms in the town gardens.
* * * *
“Flicker”: I watched an exodus of
winged white-ants, future kings and
queens of colonies to be. It had been
raining ; the ground was wet and easily
worked ; the time suited the termites. The
earth opened in a tiny tube. A pair of
eyes peeped out and took a look-see. A
body drew itself into the air and stretched
its wings. It was a future queen. She
tested herself and took her virgin flight.
Another followed her ; another and an-
other. Then, the glad word having been
passed back (not in one direction only),
they came in an endless string. The
meat-ants, cunning devils that they are,
got wind of it, too, hurried forward and
stood around that hole in the ground.
As soon as an heir-apparent showed
himself the meat-ants hauled him forth.
Another word was passed back ; and the
stream of ants stopped as if someone
had pressed a trigger. The meaties stood
round expectantly, but as they and I
watched that hole was pulled in and shut
from below. Another hole opened a
dozen yards distant; another stream
of marriageable white-ants came forth
and tried their luck in this wicked world.
* * * *
“Jack High”: Parked in the inade-
quate shelter of the only accessible gum-
tree on a desolate stretch of road south-
west of Echuca (Vic.), I was watching a
hailstorm cut its ruinous swathe across
the high-cropped countryside. A lean,
anxious-faced cocky galloped up to the
car and shouted above the barrage,
“What’s the time?” “Four o’clock,” 1
shouted back, wondering if the devas-
tation of his crop had unsettled his mind.
“Good business!” he exclaimed; and,
regardless of the fusillade of jagged ice
that was literally tearing the shirt off his
back, he sat astride his terrified nag and
smiled. “My first bit of luck for five
years,” he told me, having deigned at
last to dismount and take shelter against
the car. “Insured my crop for a thou-
sand on the second of the month, and
the fortnight’s probation expired at
three o’clock to-day.”

“Cairnsnat”: Have seen the spot where
that Quetta porthole (B. 24/10/’34) with
its thumbnail piece of coral was recov-
ered ; the working polyp on that job
must have been disturbed before it lost
its teething-ring. Cairns naturalists have

“The 0.D.”: What’s faster in the
water than the common house cat?
Pitched Tom in the dam one day just to
see if he could swim. He went like a
hydroplane. All I saw was a grey streak

“Brebio”: Recent Queensland legisla-
tion imposes drastic penalties on anyone
who without a permit cuts sandalwood,
even on his own property. Excepting
those engaged in the industry, not one
person in a hundred could tell which is
the sandalwood-tree of commerce. It
grows over the whole s.-w. of Queens-
land, though not always in commercial
quantities, and is generally known as
“plum” or “bluebush”; carrying little
heartwood it is not of much value as
timber. But it is good sheep fodder,
and will continue to be used as such.
The tree is like a young quandong, hav-
ing the same fleshy leaf and berry-like
flowers, but its foliage is a light greyish
blue as against the light green of the
quandong.

“R.J.”: I took shelter for the night
in an old humpy just off the road. Being
without matches, I was forced to unroll
my swag in the dark and make the best
of things. Presently another wayfarer
drifted -in ; he, too, being minus a light,
went through the same awkward pro-
cedure. Lying side by side in the narrow
confines of the hut, with a man-size
Queensland cyclone rearing its head out-
side, we struck up a conversation. My
unseen companion had me puzzled.
What kind of a man was he? He con-
versed in a musical voice on a wide range
of subjects ; denounced Shaw as a hum-
bug, praised H. G. Wells as the greatest
living man of letters, deplored the mis-
taken methods of our Aborigines’ Protec-
tion Department. “And I've had experi-
ence,” he said. “Blacks in the myall
country will always be treacherous.
Treat them decently and they reward
you with a spear in the back.” Awaken-
ing at dawn, 1 turned over to see what
sort of exiled son of the British peerage
my companion was. He was a full-
blooded abo., about 30 years of age!

“Yoy”: We have stickfast fleas in
South Westralia; they embed them-
selves head first in the heads of poultry
and between the toes and around the
eyes of dogs and cats. My rooster has
solved the problem. He is lord of a hen
whom he calls when he finds a dainty
morsel ; she returns the favor by fleaing
him.

“Waranbini”: The predicament of a
schoolboy in West Ryde, Sydney, who,
after a bird’s nest, thrust his arm down
the hollow spout of a tree, slipped and
hung suspended by the arm until a
chance-comer discovered him recalls a
grim tragedy of 22 years ago on Terrick
run, Queensland. A stockman stood on
his saddle to reach a nest of young galahs
in a limb of a tree, and while he had
his arm down the hollow the horse
moved on, leaving him swinging. Sharp
points and knots of the partly-decayed
wood gripped his arm, and spur-marks
on the tree-trunk showed how he had
tried to relieve the strain. How long
he hung nobody knows, but eventually
he tried to cut the arm off at the shoul-
der with his pocket-knife. That failing,
he tried again at the elbow and suc-
ceeded. After falling to the ground he
walked only a few yards. The loss of
blood must have settled him.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: Have noticed that lyre-
birds in the Bega (N.S.W.) district arc
building their nests much higher off the
ground than formerly. At last, it would
seem, these birds are taking measures to
defeat the fox—apart from bushfires their
only formidable enemy.
“Lalapaloosa”: Fijians, black and
white, smile sourly when a newcomer
raps out that hoary one about the taste-
lessness of native flesh to shark palates.
They’ll take him into the streets of Suva
and within five minutes point out two or
three one-legged or one-armed natives
passing by, the missing limbs having been
swallowed or mangled by sharks. They’ll
tell him of the three native girls taken
by sharks while fishing in knee-deep
water off a reef in the Yasawas, to the
north of Viti Levu, two or three years
ago, and they’ll relate any number of
stories about natives who have been killed
or injured while swimming from cutter
to cutter in Suva Harbor itself—true
stories, too. The curious thing is,
though, that many of the natives them-
selves seem to believe in their own im-
munity. At least, they swim in Suva
Harbor, where sharks abound, with no
more protection than a knife slung round
their necks, and often even that is for-
gotten.

“Somnus”: The abos. in south-western
Queensland, in common with our snuff-
sniffing ancestors, are remarkably free
from catarrh. Berries from the pepper-
tree (not the pepperina), dried and
crushed, form a passable pepper which
Binghi inhales. Have experimented with
it myself, and found it not so tierce.
* * * *
“Cooie-Bird”: That wasn’t a black-
snake that wriggled out of the leafy
crown of a pawpaw on the tree being
felled (B. 31/10/’34). The scaly one was
a particularly dark-hued tree-snake,
specimens of Dendrophis punctulatus ,
the common tree-snake, sometimes being
almost black on the upper surfaces imme-
diately after moult-
ing. None of the
three better-known
species of black-
snakes—t he re and -
bellied, the blue-
bellied and the
white-bellied —is a
tree-climber. Occa-
sionally a specimen
of one or other will
be met with at some
height from the
ground ; but an easy, if not always
directly visible, incline usually gives
access to such places. Legless reptiles
that climb trees are furnished on the
underparts with keeled scales, without
which it would be impossible for them to
climb.
“Bobs”: An Echuca (Vic.) fisherman
has shown me an English trout, taken
from his drum net. It was said long ago
that the arrival of this assisted immigrant
in the Murray would be an omen of ruin
to our native fish ; well, he’s here at last.
Of course, the extinction cannot be
sudden ; fish too big for trout meals will
drag their bellies over sandy bottoms for
years yet. And perhaps something will
happen to stop the invasion.
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: I don’t think we have
any cause to fear that the hare will ever
equal the rabbit as a pest, though “Puss”
is correct in stating that the Aussie hare
now has four leverets in place of the one
or two it bears in Europe (B. 14/11/’34).
I have gutted a number of doe hares
during the last month ; all had four young
in embryo. What will stop hares from
becoming a pest is the fact that drives
against them end the nuisance as far as
any particular district is concerned until
they either breed up again or work into
the cleared district from outside. I took
part in a hare drive in the Wimmera last
year; the line of men with guns and
dogs advanced steadily across the pad-
docks and few hares got away, while
guns and dogs killed thousands. What is
making the hare breed up so rapidly is
the top-dressing of land and the laying
down of permanent pasture; another
thing is the fact that not one person
in a hundred in western Vic. or the
south-east of S.A. will eat a hare, chiefly
because so few know how to prepare puss
before cooking. A hare should be
gutted, the “wild bone” between the hind-
legs removed, the inside sprinkled with
salt, and the carcase hung in a cool, well-
aired safe for three days with the skin on.
It then, when cooked, resembles a cross
between baby beef and wild duck. But
if you treat it as you would a rabbit
before cooking it resembles a tough old
tomcat.
THE KITCHEN FIRE.
When grass is crackling underfoot, and stars
still flaring hard and bright,
And dawn winds stir with icy touch the crisp,
clear stillness of the night,
From tramping over frosted hills, and crunching
through the frozen mire,
ft’s good to come indoors and meet the welcome
of the kitchen fire:
The young flames leaping bright and high,
the twigs that flare, the sparks that fly,
And morning-tea slow-sipped hard by the
cheerful kitchen fire.
And in the dancing of the coals there's solace
when the day is done;
Beside the winking fire a man forgets his
failures one by one,
And sees again those distant heights to which
youth bade him once aspire:
It’s not so hard to start again when gazing in
the kitchen fire.
The reds and ambers that it holds, the lace
of grey on glowing golds,
Whose patterned woof strange themes unfolds
deep in the kitchen fire.
But when the dying fire expires, and white ash
cloaks the coal below,
And shadows steal across the room, there’s
witchery in that last glow.
Spellbound we waited side by side, and watched
the last faint spark expire,
And she had given me her word ere we had
left the kitchen fire;
And that fire through the years, you see, has
bound her closer yet to me:
She burns the wood I endlessly hew for the
kitchen fire.

“Bill Bowyang”: If “Booraby” (B.
14 /11/’34) ever visits Bowen (N.Q.) I
will soon convince him that Poole Island
is far from being a happy haven for per-
sons who want to live in retirement. The
meatworks there did not fail for lack of
fresh water. They were destroyed by
the disastrous 1884 cyclone which almost
levelled Bowen to the ground. There
is no bird life on the island, with the ex-
ception of a few stray gulls. Considering
that people from the mainland have
visited the island almost weekly during
the past 50 years, wild pigs, ducks and
turkeys would have little chance of exist-
ing on this 25-acre speck, divided from
the mainland by a narrow strip of water
across which cattle were driven when the
meatworks were boiling down their car-
casses: The late George Heron, who had
a lease of Poole for many years, placed
goats on it, but boat crews from Bowen
soon turned them into mutton. There
are certainly oysters on the rocks and
fish in the surrounding waters, but they
are plentiful on and around other islands
in the vicinity. And the mangroves on
Poole harbor the largest mosquitoes and
sandflies that ever tormented me.


“Como”: Has some philanthropist in-
troduced the kookaburra to Hollywood
to make the gum-trees which cover its
environs feel more at home? In the
movie “Come On, Marines,” a scene sup-
posed to represent a jungle in the Philip-
pines is pepped up by the laughter of a
jackass. It is quite possible that some far-
seeing Yank has let loose a few kookas
in California, the cities of which, by the
way, are adorned by more flowering
gums than the cities of their native
country. The average Yank is astonished
when you assure him that we have gum-
trees in Australia. A few years hence
he will be astounded to discover that the
kookaburra isn’t a genuine American
citizen, especially if it laughs in an
American accent after a few generations.

“Drawback”: At Yautanaby (Eyre
Peninsula, S.A.) a Government survey
party was camped. The usual Sunday
morning haircutting was on and the
whole party of seven had their shingle.
One member had very bright-red hair ;
it fell under the shears and mingled with
the black, brown and grey locks on the
ground. Weeks after, while cutting a
line through the mallee, one of the chain-
men found a honeyeater’s nest half a
mile from camp. It was built as usual
on the outside, but was lined inside with
nothing but bright-red hair. The birds
had scorned every one’s discarded thatch
but Beney’s.

“Wang”: Dave reckoned he was “right
bower” with the girl at the store till
anew bank clerk arrived. Then Tilly
refused to go riding with Dave, and took
“Take any interest in this Eucharistic Congress, Mr. Snoggins?”
“Not a bit. I never could play cards.”
to playing tennis with the newcomer.
Dave couldn’t play tennis; bitterly he
began hanging around the courts when
young Penwiper and Tilly were playing.
He stood it for a long time, but one
afternoon during a game he heard Tilly
cry “love.” In a frenzy Dave made to-
wards the clerk and yelled, “I can’t stop
her callin’ yer ‘love’; but, be cripes! if
yer call her ‘darlin’ ’ or ‘sweetie’ I’ll punch
yer head orf.” The clerk wasn’t
bluffed. “Oh! will you?” he replied.
“Perhaps the boot might be on the other
foot.” Dave pondered on this cryptic
remark for a moment or two. “Ah! ” he
cried, “I’ve finished with her. Yer one
of them coots I’ve heard ’bout what puts
the boot into "a bloke, are yer? Well, if
she wants yer, she’s welcome t’ yer.”

“J.R.D.”: An old and persistent
publicity-shunning friend of mine has at
last been forced into the
limelight. A pair, about a
strange, new iguana marked
with bright-yellow spots and
with a head like an alligator,
totally new to science until
its discovery in Centralia,
sent my memory questing
backwards. A photograph
of the newly-discovered rep-
tile not only decided the
matter but occasioned a
querulous, elated feeling in
my inside —the sort of feel-
ing a man would get if his
host casually informed him
that the drumstick he had
just dined off belonged to a
moa. Quarter of a century
ago the spotted bloke was
no stranger on the menu of
Territory abos., although
they preferred his less-varie-
gated cousin ; and when we
ran out of meat grilled
goanna was not to be
sneezed at —not the tail part,
anyhow. The inference that
the abos. call them “prin-
ties,” from the similarity of
their color-scheme to print
fabrics, sounds like a sample
of overstretched journalistic
imagination; the abos. I
knew were unspoiled by
print—spotted, newspaper or
otherwise. But if this hefty
6ft. goanna, known to hun-
dreds of bushmen, has
hitherto remained unknown
to science, how many smaller unnamed
fauna may still be featuring as familiar
items on abo. menus every day in the
year?

“Col. Bungstarter”: Some old-time
builder must have grinned cheerily
in Walhalla (Vic.) when the vineyard
premises, built in 1866, survived, un-
damaged, a recent cyclonic blow which
wrecked completely the new Nudgee Golf
Club building near Brisbane. It was a
full-size blow, too. More than 20 houses
were unroofed or blown off their stumps,
sections of roofs were carried half a mile,
and a large staircase was wafted across-
country for 400 yards. Luckily, no lives
were lost. Queensland has no monopoly
of these tornadoes. A section of North
Brighton, one of Melbourne’s most ex-
clusive suburbs, was once knocked about
badly in the same way. At Nevertire
(N.S.W.) a tornado effected a union of
the churches—in a paddock within a few
minutes. A “cloudburst” in Tas. tore a
gash 40ft. deep in a hillside not far from
Launceston. If such a visitor were to
arrive at any closely-populated city area
the results would be unpleasant to con-
template.

Cudgerte : Don’t know why the sea-
horse disagrees with the shag’s’ digestive
organs (B. 31/10/’34), but can anybody
tell me why the crocodile will never
tackle this long-necked fowl? I’ve seen
N.Q. waterholes in which crocs, were
plentiful absolutely devoid of game, but
on them shags were always numerous,
A pirate, an it please you, and never learned to tie a slip-knot!”
Binghi says that the shag and croc, are
mates. Looks like it, too. Possibly no
&elf-respecting lizard would tackle a
bird about as palatable as a piece of
stewed rubber tyre.

“W. 8.”: A friend stationed at Rabaul
has a house-boy, Hector. “Well, Hector,”
he said, “what’s your fancy for the
Caulfield Cup?” With the air of a veri-
table savant of the turf, Hector replied,
“Boss, you bet on Carbine, him fine
pfeller, sure to win. Him kick four goals
three behinds!”

How do goannas come down from a
tree?
“Ronel”: They come down as they go up—
head first. Any tree that provides sufficient
grip for a goanna to ascend will suit him to
cling to as he returns to earth; but I’ve never
seen him waste time trying to climb a large,
smooth bark gum unless it had a considerable
lean. He can shin up a small or medium gum
with ease.
“Go-gazer”: They come down straight trees
by means of side-slips, dropping the last few
feet to the ground. On leaning trees they come
down almost head first. I once saw a go.
miss his footing from about 60ft. up a. smooth-
barked flooded gum. He struck the ground
with a thud, but was up another tree before
I could run 25 yards to catch him.
“Sir Spen”: If a go. has time on his hands—
or his feet —he will climb leisurely down back-
wards. But I’ve seen a small go. pursued by
a full-grown one dive off a limb 15ft. from
the ground, tail and legs outstretched, and
pancake to earth. No. 2 followed suit. Both
set off from the landing-ground at a smart
pace into the bush again.
“Shellback”: On the Pacific Highway
(N.S.W.) a big go. persistently raided the staff
mess-kitchen, and always beat us to an adjoin-
ing tree. One evening we tried to bring him
down with stones, and, though unsuccessful,
made things so unpleasant that he moved his
quarters from one branch to another several
times. In doing so he always descended head
first, in a spiral round the branch, apparently to
secure a better grade.
*.*.'s*
“Silentio”: Canine memory? A friend
cut the tails off the first litter of our
fox-terrier’s pups. The deed angered
the young mother immensely ; she would
bare her fangs and go for him every
possible time. Much maternity.has mel-
lowed her, and she is a sociable being
now. But when the tail-lopper .called to
see us the other day after an absence of
seven years she flew at him like an en-
raged Alsatian.

“Prickly”: “Porcupine Joe” must be
quoting from the wrong cookery-book
surely when he advises, in reference to
bandicoots, “And watch the dogs!” (B.
24/10/’34). I have dealt with bandies
from Giru (N.Q.) to the Tweed (N.S.W.).
As fodder for a white man, I reckon
they’re the best in the bush, equal to
kangaroo-tail stew or soup. But I
never had a dog which would do more
than sniff at one, wrinkle his nose and
turn away.
* * * *
“Noondoo”: Only saw those cross-
bearing frogs once (B. 7/ 9/ ’34), and fcr
quarter of an hour, but there were
enough of them to make a lasting im-
pression. It was at a station homestead
in southern Queensland in a red-hot
midsummer. There was a big garden
round the house with well-dug beds, but
elsewhere the ground was flintlike red
clay. A summer thunderstorm blazed
up, and in no time brought out millions
of flying-ants. The ground heaved all
about like a minor Resurrection, and
from their voluntary graves came thou-
sands of these frogs. The host got busy
on the ant swarm, now straggling every-
where and trying to get rid of its wings.
In 10 minutes there was hardly an ant in
sight. Two minutes later the toads had
returned to the tomb.
* * *
“Wagga”: Telegraph linesmen in n.-e.
Vic. have a new danger to face. The
other day a party found the crossbar on
one post hollowed right out and the
upper portion of the post itself eaten
out —the work of white-ants. Now care-
ful examination has to be made before
ladders are propped against posts, as a
man might find himself suddenly precipi-
tated into space. There were no external
indications of the termites’ work.
* * * *
“Pack Saddle”: Strange teams? Has
one beaten the feat of a team of billy-
goats that, in 1890, pulled a wool waggon
(loaded) from a shed on Milo station
in the Adavale district (Q.)? It is still
recalled by old-timers. After the job
the same team pulled an empty waggon
from the open into the shed from which
they had cleared the other. Don’t know
what the tonnage of the load was, but
even an empty waggon was some pull.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: It wasn’t much of a
car, but the proud owner said it was a
wonder when the going was heavy. A
splutter, a few kicks and Lizzie com-
menced to jib. A curse, a kick from a
heavy hobnailed boot at the ammeter,
and the old girl picked up wonderfully.
“That’s all she wants now and again,”
explained the owner —“a kick in the
belly.”
“Bitter Bark”: The Daintree River dis-
trict (N.Q.) produces a species of hard-
wood which, besides yielding timber suit-
able for bridge-building, has the remark-
able characteristic of forming stones in-
side the trunk. These gibbers are some-
times in the form of a slab, sometimes
round, and are of a cement-like forma-
tion and color. They play the devil with
a saw, and when struck with a steel will
produce sparks like most igneous rocks.
* * * *
“T.V.T.”: Don’t know what kind of
snakes “Diba More” has in Papua (B.
24/10/’34), but I’ve always understood
that the brown wriggler is the only Aus-
tralian snake that lays eggs. All other
species are viviparous ; so, if it v>ac a
mainland snake, and black, the eggs prob-
ably belonged to some member of the
lizard family.
EAST OF LAVERTON.
If you’ve been east of Laverton —out in those
regions wide
Where reefs that have been found and lost
mysteriously hide —
If you’ve been there, however brief your stay,
you’ll hardly fail
To gain and hold an audience to listen to your
tale.
The tales from east of Laverton are held in
high repute;
Hard though they may be to believe, they’re
harder to refute.
You’ll hear them daily on the kerb and nightly
in the bar,
For distant fields grow greener yet the further
off they are.
If you’ve been east of Laverton, then for a
while you’re set,
And while the going’s good, my son, you’ll
grab all you can get.
For let me whisper in your ear you’ll only
hold your place
Until some other wanderer blows in and trumps
your ace.
Out east of lonely Laverton there lies a
mystery land,
Where lost reefs hide beyond a waste of
spinifex and sand.
Though strange the tales that come from there,
this much at least is clear:
An outcrop east of Laverton is worth a lot
of beer.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
NECK WOOL.
“Murrawong”: I don't fully agree with
“Mouton” (B. 14/11/’34). If fleeces are
to be skirled free of burr, necks must
be removed regardless of the fact of
their being seedy or matted. In any case,
the extent of the skirting is a matter
which must be decided by the classer with
all the factors before him. Each clip
must be treated on its own merits.
If the wool is free and the sheep are
fairly straight-necked, light skirting
should suffice. But the first principle of
classing is to keep each line as even as
possible, and flock sheep with heavy neck
folds are usually uneven to the point of
hairiness on these folds. The classer
who leaves such necks on the fleece is
sacrificing his main lines to gain a doubt-
ful point. As a rule, the neck is the high-
est yielding portion of the fleece, and that
factor often results in necks bringing as
much as the average fleece lines and
more than inferior fleece.
The further question of when to make
a separate line of necks, apart from
broken, depends mainly on the size of
the clip.
In small flocks where the- star-lots
problem is ever present, necks and
broken should comprise one line, branded
Broken, the short and fribby trimmings
making the second line, Pieces. But if
necks are seedy and five bales are a
possibility, they should be kept separate.
“Earnest”: In my judgment, belly-
wools should be skirted, rolled or pizzled
by the board-boys in small sheds, and by
special pickers in large sheds. They
should never be placed on the wool-
rolling or piece-picking tables, as they
are likely to become mixed with the dif-
ferent type of skirtings handled there
In sheds of not more than four stands,
merino-wool skirtings (pieces) can be
handled on large wool-rolling tables.
“Mouton” is almost right’ here, but
they should be picked as follows: Long-
est, lightest, brightest wool, Ist line,
branded BKN ; shorter, heavier wool and
trimmings from BKN, 2nd line, branded
Ist PCS ; discolored, stained wool, 3rd
line, branded PCS.
Necks should be kept’ separate from
britches in larger clips, as they are always
lighter in condition, and sometimes more
open and wasty. In small clips, there
isn’t enough wool to permit this being
done.
Necks always should be skirted off
the fleece wool. If it is recognisable as
neck wool, it is certainly not fleece wool.
This applies to all skirtings. My ad-
vice is: Remove all wool that looks in-
ferior to the major portion of the fleece,
such as burry, seedy, matted, open, per-
ished or hairy-tipped wool, but don’t re-
move any good fleece-wool with it. If
the major portion of the fleece is burry
or seedy, remove only the worst of it.
DIPPING FOR FLY.
“W.D.McC.”: “Albarmount” states
(B. 7/11/ ’34) that his sheep were only
immune for a fortnight after dipping.
There must be something wrong with
his methods, because if you dip properly
in an arsenical-powder solution, and if
rain does not fall before the dip sets, it is
impossible for the larvae of the fly to
live except in a spot always wet, such
as^ y 40 years is that
d j ps with a phenol or similar base are
useless as a fly preventive, although they
may be good for vermin or for the
growth and lustre of the wool,
factor m, dipping * JhatJ hewaer

aub
'
HANDLING LOCKS,
“Trepex”: It pays to keep board
j ocks and table locks separate in a shed
even srtl all enough to give only a light
ba ] e G f eac h.
Board locks are made up of small
p i e ces, broken off bits of fleece, trim-
m j n gs an d other what-nots of fair length
and bulk, with sheep cutting any sort
of wool at all they are likely to be of
comfortable length',
Table locks consist of the fribs and
second cuts which have fallen through
the battens, and, while much lighter, they
are shorter, and are put to an entiiely
different use from board By se
each sort has its use ; blended, they form
an inferior mixture,
Quickness and convenience in working
the shed are not everything. Chase the
pennies.
VARIEGATED FLEECES.
“Murrawong”: The instances of varie-
gated wool mentioned by “Valerin” (B.
14/11/’34) may be due to water-rot. I
have samples of fleece —green, brown, red
and purple, as well as several staples
discolored half-way down from the tip—
which appear to be similar to those men-
tioned.
These were the product of a year of
excessive summer rain.
The next six months were dry, and
the growth' of that period was perfectly
clean. I have seen samples of wool from
a black- or, rather, brown-woolled merino
with a distinct white bar or ribbon iin.
wide half-way down the staple. There
was no sign of a break at the spot, so
the only feasible theory was that the
pigmentation cells of the animals must
have been affected for a week or two.
This was patently a freak occurrence,
whereas the water-rot discoloration is
only too common in a wet year.
SHEEP AND CYSTINE.
“Stump Jump”: “Jass’s” remarks (B
21/11/ ’34) are supplemented by experi-
ments at Cornell University (U.S.A.).
Using the animal metabolism method,
scientists there confirmed the opinion that
ruminants, sheep and cows, had the ability
of building up the necessary proteins
either for milk or wool in the digestive
tract. Bacterial action was mainly re-
sponsible, through the natural ferments in
fodder.
This clears up the misunderstanding as
to where the cystine in wool comes from,
and why milk has the growing proteins
which young stock cannot secure directly
from the plants eaten by the parents.
The bacteria present in the tracts are
exclusive to the animal’s purpose. This
explains why milk from cows is not as
good for lambs as ewes’ milk, no matter
how it is broken down. Lambs haven't
the kind of bacteria to handle it any
more than the cow’s organisms can manu-
facture wool-growing cystine.
CUT OUT THE TAR.
“Jumbuck”: It is years since the Wool
Industries Research Association, Leeds
(Eng.), furnished a formula lor an all-
weather branding fluid harmless to wool.
Based on this formula several branding
fluids have been placed on the Australian
market by manufacturers. Colors are
black, blue, red and green. But hundreds
of graziers wiil insist in using tar for
branding purposes. Why?
It’s not on the score of economy. The
purchased branding fluid is as cheap
as tar and will remain in the wool just
as long. There’s always the black brand-
ing fluid for the fellow who does not
care for a colored brand.
Tar and mineral-oil fluids, not being
emulsifiable in water, affect the sale of
the wool. During scouring operations
tar- or mineral-oil-stained wool is liable
to become damaged in the fibres due to
the strong liquor and heat required to
try and get rid of the stains.
After treatment the wool is harsh to
handle and the tarry smell still remains.
Tar is nearly as great a curse in some
wool as twine and jute.
SORE BACKS.
“Jaen Eille”: No horse ever gets a sore
back if properly looked after. The
weight on the horse’s back tends to break
down the blood circulation and to destroy
the tissues underneath the skin on which
the saddle rests.
This results in the skin becoming gener-
ally unhealthy and, finally, in sores. After
a hot morning’s ride do not merely slip
the bit out of the horse’s mouth' and
leave him to graze for an hour. Remove
the saddle, and give his back a vigorous
rub-down, either with bare fists of a
handful of grass.
“Blister”: Very well, “Cuchulain”
(B. 31/10/’34) knows all about it.
Still, let me tell him that his hot brine
lotion went out of date about the time
prize-fighting was knocked on the head.
I’ve tried it —it’s only waste time and
pain.
I took it for granted that “C.” and
others would have the gumption to fold
the cloth evenly on both sides, without
having to stress the obvious. The main
thing is not to prevent the saddle from
moving, but to balance it. If the former
was the only thing, a laced surcingle
would meet the case.
I said a set-fast or a sore back could
not be cured under fast work. Boundary-
riding and Sunday-hacking don’t come
within that class. As for his old Arab
trick of the sheepskin—bosh! We’ve got
nothing to learn from the Arabs in the
care of our horses, and, anyway, the con-
ditions are dissimilar.
If a man wants to ruin his horse’s back
beyond a hope of repair, let him use that
sheepskin.
A horsehair pad is cool, airy, springy,
and it doesn’t act as a sweat-pad and a
blister combined.
MULES FOR THE NORTH.
“The Breaker”: Cane-farmers in N.
Queensland are becoming interested in
mules, and the importation of jacks
from Spain to cross with heavy mares is
being considered. The resultant type of
mule should make a sound plough-puller.
{Continued on page 24.)
Mules will hold their conditipn on far
less feed than horses. I’ve seen them do
well on country where goats would die.
The mule is not the jib it is said to be,
and for endurance beats Dobbin and co.
No better proof of its qualities could
be forthcoming than during the Sinai-
Palestine campaign, in which it drew
heavy transport loads through all sorts
of desert trouble.
Still, if mule breeding is to be carried
out seriously, there’s no need for the
Queensland Government to go as far as
Spain for the jacks.
There are hundreds more than would
be needed running wild around Farina
(S.A.). , t ,
The donkey team has long been a tea-
ture of Central Australia.
POINTS IN CALF-REARING.
“Jimmac”: The important thing to re-
member is that they should be treated like
children —handled quietly and patiently
and fed regularly.
Feed only clean, sweet milk, and on no
account should the froth be given to
calves. Feeding buckets should be spot-
lessly clean, and the yard and surround-
ings free of rubbish and manure.
Feed milk at body temperature, pro-
vide shade in summer, and shelter from
cold winds or rain. This is a much
cheaper method of conserving animal
energy than by having to supply larger
amounts of food.
A suitable lick (such as salt and bone-
meal) should be provided.
Lastly, since calves have the same
habits as goats, but without the latter’s
digestive apparatus, pick up all pieces of
paper, string or rag.
DEHORNING.
“Coolothin”: Dehorning dairy cattle
is being more and more adopted by
Queensland dairymen. Opponents say it
spoils the look of the cattle, but anyone
who has milked in a yard with a de-
horned herd will appreciate its advan-
tages. “Quiet coos, mair milk.”
The best time to dehorn is before
calves are three weeks old. Then it is
easily done with a caustic stick. Wrap
a piece of paper round one end of the
stick as a holder, dip lightly in water and
rub six or seven times across the skin
on top of the young horn. There will
be no blister, and apparently the calves
suffer no pain.
When buying the stick ask the chemist
to put it in a test tube with a small piece
of cotton-wool at the top and bottom,
and seal the cork in the tube with paraffin
wax (candle-fat' will do). Kept in this
way it will last for months if it is dried
and put away quickly after use. If left
exposed to the air it soon becomes liquid.
Don’t let an amateur monkey with the
horns of mature cattle. Hacking at them
means loss of milk, and sometimes of
a cow, since there is a big risk of after-
infection of the stump, if not properly
dressed.
HAY V. ENSILAGE.
“Spring”: Tell “Aparcatus” that his
lucerne ensilage costs are impossible
unless the labor is mostly unpaid (B.
• 14/11/’34).
The following analysis of the two jobs
will prove it: (1) Ensilage has to be
mown and raked, and either carted im-
mediately or cocked. The work in this
depends on amount cut, men, weather,
etc.
The same applies to hay, except for
the time allowed for curing.
(2) A pit has to be made for ensilage.
No pit is required for hay.
(3) Ensilage must be carted green, and
is at least six times heavier than hay.
Hence more trips to the pits.
The hay-carter takes longer to get a
load, but carries more when he gets it.
(4) Ensilage calls for tipping of loads
and a man spreading all the time. Also,

There is one simple way of measuring
advertising efficiency and that is by
results.
Advertising, correctly applied, is not
only salesmanship in itself, but in
most cases the only incentive that
will effect a paying trade distribution.
Just how its power is used may vary
considerably, but after comparison
the conclusion of many firms is that
the methods adopted by O'Brien
Publicity Company show a decided
advantage, in that the results are
reflected in a highly satisfactory
balance sheet.

the dray is made to do an extra journey
over the pit for compression purposes.
Hay has to be unloaded. Many
times I have unloaded H tons of hay
in under the half-hour, whilst two men
have stacked it.
(5) When the silage pit is full, it must
be properly sealed. More time and
money.
When the haystack is topped, it needs
a wire over it. Two minutes’ work.
I have based the work on the supposi-
tion that three men only are being used
in each case.
I doubt if “Ensilage” would finish' a
given acreage any quicker than “Hay”
would. If “Hay” used mechanical
waggon-loaders, elevators or, better still,
“grabs” at the stack, then “Ensilage”
wouldn’t have a hope of competing.
When feeding-time comes, “Hay” gets
still further advantages over his rival.
On conservative estimates, at least two
tons of ensilage are required to yield
the sheep as much nourishment as one
ton of hay. “Ensilage” accordingly pays
double feeding and working expenses.
Ensilage from improperly sealed pits
is harmful to the stock, whilst hay is not.
“Ensilage” has to unseal his pit and
then dig or hack the stuff out. “Hay”
cuts his stacks quickly with a knife and
has his stock fed long before his rival.
The unsealed silo sometimes gets
spoiled if not all used, but the stack
never does.
The stack wastage is negligible com-
pared to that from most pits.
Having made and fed both, I repeat:
“A golden rule is never make ensilage
when you can make hay.”
“Granova”: Having just put down a
100-ton pit of eaten silage, I support Mr.
Brunskill’s cost figures. It took four men
five days to fill the pit, and three men
two days to cover it.
The cost of the job, including twine,
worked out at 3s. 4d. per ton. Two men
with a good tank-sinking plant can make
a 100-ton pit in three days.
“Stump Jump” (B. 14/11/’34) is rash
in not trampling his material, for there
is danger in air spaces. Also, it is even
more risky to put only 2in. of dirt over
the pit.
To be on the safe side cover to a depth
of Ift. The extra weight will ensure a
better pack.
GROWING “GRASS-CONSCIOUS.”
“Sorghum”: The progress of pasture
improvement is encouraging. The area of
sown grasses, clovers, etc., has increased
fourfold in the last 20 years, and the
present area in N. S. Wales alone is
roughly 2,000,000 acres.
There is a suitable variety of pasture
for every locality. Lucerne, which up to
1922 was mainly grown on river flats, is
profitable on average wheat land in the
Riverina.
J. N. Whiffet, N.S.W. Agrostologist, es-
timates that 3,000,000 acres in the
Riverina could be established in lucerne.
When we compare the present acreage
in N. S. Wales of 300,000 acres with
22,000,000 acres in the Argentine, we
appreciate just how the latter country has
achieved the premier position in the
chilled-beef trade. Australia’s wealth last
year derived from grass and lucerne, and,
including wool, meat, butter and cheese,
amounted to half the value of our total
export.
Each year we are growing more “grass-
conscious,” and the day when farmers
could sit back and leave their pastures to
Providence has gone. Drought, rabbits
and periodic grasshopper plagues are
forcing graziers to the pasture renovator
and the seed drill.
SOIL EROSION.
“P.L.8.”: In recent U.S.A. erosion
tests, extending over 18 months, these
conclusions were reached:
(1) A short slope showed the greatest
loss of water by “run-off.”
(2) Erosion on long slopes increased
out of proportion to the short ones,
though the run-off was less. After
ploughing it was small, but when the soil
bed had firmed from frequent cultivation
the loss was almost two tons of the most
soluble and best soil from a strip 100 ft.
long by sft. wide. The rainfall was
On a 10ft. slope erosion was slight in
tne same test.
(3) Under no condition was slope
ground so saturated that it could not
absorb more moisture.
Drains across the slope with a slight
fall to a getaway would lessen erosion.
They must be not more than two chains
apart on grassland and one chain on cul-
tivation.
A single furrow and crown would
serve as a drain.
The direction of ploughing could be
altered to provide the same effect in
some cases. The loss of extra soakage
obtained on the lower slopes by doing
this would be more than balanced by
the soil retained. Also, washaways would
not occur, as only a long slope can cause
them.
COMBATING THE FRUIT-FLY.
“Johnno”: In mainland States the fruit-
fly is likely to be more than ordinarily
destructive this summer, so the preven-
tive campaign should be planned now.
Infested fallen fruit should be de-
stroyed by boiling, burning or burying
deeply. It is a mistake to keep the
ground beneath the trees entirely free of
fallen fruit. The soundest falls at each
gathering, which should be not more
than two days apart, should be left for
the flies, otherwise fruit on the trees
will be “stung” in its place.
The fruit-fly will oviposit readily in
fallen fruit in the shade.
The fruit-fly is constantly on the move,
entering the orchard from outside at
short intervals throughout the day. It
is most active during the early part of
the afternoon, and in coastal districts will
continue busy till well after sundown.
The fly travels always with the wind.
Lures are effective only in some parts.
In such districts, the more traps put out
the better. The best location for them
is on the side of the orchard from which
the wind blows.
In a 10-acre orchard, at least 1000 flies
should be caught daily during the period
when the pest is at its worst. A dozen
well-placed traps should be enough on
this area. The most effective traps are
the kiddies. Once they take to the job it
becomes an exciting game. Paying 3d.
per 100, the writer had to fork out to
his nieces and nephews from 9d. to
Is. 6d. a day during several mango sea-
sons. In their two and three weeks’
holiday the youngsters accounted for
thousands of flies, all caught by hand off
fruit on the ground and that within easy
reach on the trees.
Smokescreens in which there is a pro-
nounced flavoring of tar often produce
good results. But there must be smoke
all day.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“O. W. Waireki”: A quickly-made
remedy for Strawberry’s sore teats: Mix
equal parts of melted mutton-fat and
whale oil. Apply after each milking.
“R.J.”: To avoid clogging of wet dirt
left on the mouldboard after ploughing
give the board a wipe over with a piece
of oily waste every time the plough is
used.
“1.G.X.”: Tell “Nedos” (B. 24/10/’34)
that in places where Noogoora grows pas-
palum will also grow, and in the course
of three or four years will smother the
burr.
“A.G.T.”: To facilitate the repair
of pipes in a well fit flanged joints every
15ft. Make the pump-rod joints coincide
with the flanged joints.
“Karaway”: Anybody can make his
own varnish where grass-trees grow.
Knock the leaf-bases and gum off the
trunk with the back of a tomahawk, dry-
blow or sieve the gum from the refuse,
crush the gum as finely as possible and
mix to the consistency of ordinary
varnish with methylated spirit. Of the
three kinds —red, yellow and chestnut—
the best for varnish is the yellow.
“Pick”: “Catchpenny” (B. 21/11 /’34)
thinks that wire fences are apt to lead
lightning to horses or sheep huddled in
their vicinity. For years a boundary-
rider, never once have 1 seen a panel
struck by lightning in the many miles of
wire fence that I tended. On five dif-
ferent occasions though I have seen light-
ning strike mobs of travelling sheep, and
thrice I have seen similar disasters over-
take teams of horses. A fixed bush be-
lief is that horses and sheep, when clus-
tered together, are potential conductors
of electricity.

AGAINST THE RULES.
The first party I ever threw in Darling-
hurst was a roaring success until mid-
night, when supplies ran low.
Not knowing the locality, I asked the
landlord the way to the nearest shypoo
shop.
“The nearest?” he laughed. “Why—
right here!” And he led me under the
stairs, where my eyes were gladdened
by a well-stocked cellar.
“Always buy on your own premises,”
he said. “It’s more patriotic.”
Overjoyed with the convenience of
this, I purchased enough to satisfy the
capacity even of my guests.
But, oh! the depression of the morn-
ing after! I felt convinced that life was
futile, and that there was no hope for
humanity. I yearned ferociously for a
stimulant, but I did not have enough
energy to go to the pub. With a throb
of gratitude, I remembered the land-
lord’s cellar.
I struggled to his room.
“I’m dying,” I told him. “For heaven’s
sake let’s have another bottle.”
“Sorry, old chap,” he replied, glanc-
ing at his watch, “but you’ll have to
get it at the pub. It’s against the rules
for us to sell liquor after 6 aim.”

CONSIDERATION.
The secretary was going through the
correspondence with the Minister.
“There is only one other matter,” he
remarked as he took a paper from the
pile on the desk. “There is a communi-
cation here from some new society ask-
ing the Government for financial assist-
ance. They have set out the objects at
length and”
The Minister interrupted.
“What! Financial assistance? No
chance. Knock ’em back.”
“Very well, sir,” said the secretary.
Later he dictated the reply to the
stenographer, the preamble comrqenc-
ing:
“Dear Sir, —With reference to your
communication of the 15th inst., I am
directed by the Hon. the Minister to
inform you that, after the most careful
and sympathetic consideration, it is
greatly regretted”

BLESSED ARE THE MEEK.
The meek, insignificant-looking little
man with the deprecating smile entered
the grocer’s shop.
“May I ask,” he said in a small voice,
“who was the gentleman who sold my
wife some butter yesterday?”
“I’m the man,” replied the assistant.
“What about it?”
“Oh—er—it’s quite all right,” ex-
claimed the meek little man hurriedly.
“No offence whatever. The butter was all
right, except that three copper-colored
hairs I found in it seemed somewhat in-
congruous. They did not seem to blend
with the background, and would be apt
to offend an artistic temperament.”
The ass i s tant
took a long breath
as if to make a
charge.
“And,” went on
the little man hur-
riedly, as if afraid
he was about to be
int e r r u p ted, “I
think it scarcely
fair to include tacks
in the butter un-
less you put in a
hammer as well so
that we can draw
the tacks out when
the butter is on the
table.”
The assistant was
gasping like a
stranded fish, mak-
ing ina r t i culate
noises in his throat.
The little man
pur sued calmly:
“Referring again to
the aforementioned
hair, permit me to say I find no fault in
the quantity or its length. It was loqg and
luxuriant, but there is a place for every-
thing, and hair and butter, you will
admit, scarcely go together.
“Whilst on the subject of butter I might
possibly touch lightly upon its age, but
I have some reason to suspect that this
butter was made from cream, and that
the cream came from a cow, and that
the cow is a female ; and I have been
taught from my youth up to abstain
from all references to age of the female
kind, either remotely or contiguously.
Of course, we all know that butter is
simply agitated cream, which simply
goes to show you how Communism is
spreading. I don’t blame you for that.
“Therefore, I shall not animadvert
upon the subject of the age of the butter,
except to remark, incidentally, that the
phrase ‘feeble old age’ does not in the
very remotest degree apply to this case.
“I wish you’d send up to the house a
bag of rolled oats, four bars of soap, a
packet of starch and two pounds of
sugar. My wife asked me to leave the
order, and she said she’d come around
herself and speak to you about the
butter. Good morning!”

HER LOSS.
With a sigh she sank into a chair and
looked at herself in the mirror. There
was no doubt about it. She had lost
her charm.
Why had she been so infernally care-
less? Her most cherished possession had
vanished . . . But perhaps there was yet
a chance.
Hastily she opened a drawer and
searched carefully through the contents.
Presently a sigh escaped her. It was
no use! Her charm had gone.
She would have to borrow Is. 6d. and

SERVE HIM RIGHT.
Old Bill’s only companion was a big,
nondescript dog with a mangy coat and
a nasty disposition.
“He ain’t too sweet-tempered,” Bill ad-
mitted, “but he does me.”
A neighbor calling in at the hut found
the old man squatting uncomfortably by
the fire. The only chair was occupied
by Peter, the dog.
“Y’ don’t look too comfortable, Bill,”
the neighbor remarked. “Why don’t y’
kick Peter out and sit in the chair yer-
self?”
“Aw,” said Bill, “he got there first.”
One night, smoke issuing from the hut
caused the neighbors to run to the old
man’s assistance.
The hut was blazing when the first-
comer arrived.
Throwing a wet bag over his head,
the man broke open the door. Dense
clouds of smoke met him. The bed was
but a few steps from the door.
Snatching#the limp body covered by
bedclothes, he staggered forth.
Others took the inanimate form from
the rescuer’s arms. The singed blankets
were unrolled. The lifeless body which
lay revealed was not that of old Bill, but
that of Pete.
From the shed across the yard came
the unkempt figure of Bill.
His eyes travelled to the dog, lying
dead upon the ground.
“It was his fault,” Bill drawled. “He
would have the bed. I had t’ sleep in
the shed.”

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XV. — THE SCIENTIST.
For scientists who talk at length
On “isms,” “ics” and “ologies,”
Expounding theories, old and new,
We offer no apologies.
Their knowledge seems to be so great
And ours so very small
That when they speak we hesitate
To say a word at all.
The only way to knock one back
Is—put another on his track.
Scientists have raised to the level of a
fine art the craft of getting something for
nothing. They publish theories and for-
mula;, quote figures and facts which the
ordinary man is unable to refute, and
speak a jargon which no one else can un-
derstand. By dint of these accomplish-
ments they induce a trusting world to
support them in comfort. .
As a rule, they show little interest in
the common things of everyday life, and
are never really happy unless they are
talking in figures incredibly large or un-
believably small, in either case incapable
of contradiction.
Of course, different branches of science
have different ideas of what is a big
number. We can imagine the sort of talk
that goes on in the smokeroom of the
Scientists’ Club.
“There are 25,000 species of earthworm
in Australia,” remarks one, “and that is
without counting Wriggly crawliensis, be-
lived to be extinct.”
“That’s nothing,” replies an entomolo-
gist. “The dingo-fly has 150,000 eyes,
each of which is more powerful than the
human optic.”
“Humph!” retorts a piscatorial expert.
“Do you know that the common herring
lays 2,500,000 eggs in a season? lam
speaking of the female, of course.”
The first two speakers turn away and
ignore him, but a geologist pulls a chunk
of stone from his pocket.
“This is from deposits of the pre-
Camisole period,” he remarks gloatingly.
“It was laid down 200,000,000 years ago."
An astronomer pricks up his ears and
joins in.
“Well, that’s a marvellous coincidence,
because just at that time the light from
the bright star Weeviljuice, which we see
to-night with the naked eye, commenced
the penultimate stage of its journey, and
had only a millionth part of the distance
yet to cover. Most remarkable!”
The geologist puts his sample away
sadly. “It’s all theory,” he mutters to the
botanist. “He can’t prove it, you know.”
In earlier and more enlightened days,
scientists used to be burnt at the stake.
Earlier still they were simply poleaxed
or clubbed to death. Then came a more
humane period, during which no one wor-
ried about them and they were left to
starve to death in peace.
Nowadays, they are pampered and
spoilt, and they’d probably never die at
all if it weren’t for their curiosity to find
out what it feels like. Of course, they
are not inquisitive in the way ordinary
people are inquisitive. Their curiosity is
merely an example of the scientific mind.

“ ‘Pedestrians ask to be run over,’ declares
a motor journal.”
If chaps like me who cross the street
On hastening and trembling feet
Seek recognition in the lists
Of maimed or slain, then it behoves
Me to remark that motorists
Are certainly obliging coves!

For whom all winds are quiet as the sun,
All waters as the shore.
(1) What is “sugar diabetes” ? (2) Symp-
toms ? (3) Any precautionary measures ? (4)
Cure, if any ? (5) Treatment ? —4276.
(1) A chronic disorder of metabolism, char-
acterised by the constant presence of grape-
sugar in the urine. Although the manufacture
of sugar is a normal process, the fault in dia-
betes is its accumulation in the blood and
system as a whole. Exact location of the
trouble is in the pancreas, which organ secretes
a ferment essential to the storage of sugar
and its distribution. The disease may follow
certain disturbances in the nervous system;
functional gland disorders (thyroid, etc.) pre-
cipitate an inherited trait. (2) Variable. Thirst
is almost constant, the mouth is dry and
parched, and a progressive loss of weight and
strength develops. (3), (4) and (5) The urine
test for sugar is a primary, essential in diag-
nosis. With a suitable diet, insulin may be
prescribed under medical supervision.
Diet suitable for a boy of 15 if suffering
from chronic nephritis ? —4294.
A milk diet is indicated in acute forms of
the disease; this may be added to as the con-
dition improves. Meat extracts, soup, etc., are
to be avoided; also fruits and vegetables rich
in irritating salts, as rhubarb, tomatoes, aspara-
gus, gooseberries. The suitability of any diet
must be determined by an occasional urine test.
Can a plate be obtained to fill up the
cavity in a cleft palate and improve speech ?
—4340.
No plate can be fitted which will altogether
obviate disfigurement in cleft palate. Medical
inspection is necessary before a plate can be
prescribed.
What is a gyroplane ? —4423.
An aeroplane in which the wings are free
to rotate about an approximately vertical axis.
No driving power is supplied to them mech-
anically, their rotation being dependent on the
forward rotation of the whole machine. The
type was originated in Spain between 1919 and
1924 by de la Cierva. In his machine (the
autogyro) an essential feature is the bringing
of each of the wings about an axis perpen-
dicular to the spindle about which they rotate.
Although the autogyro cannot hover, it is
capable of a very low minimum speed and it
can glide at so steep an angle that it appears
to the eye to be descending vertically. On
touching the ground it stops after a few yards,
and can thus land in a very small space.
(1) Name of any commercial autogyro air-
craft ( two-seater) ? (2) Approximate price
landed in Australia ? (3) Landing speed ? (4)
Taking-off speed? (5) Cruising speed? (6)
Reliability ? (7) Any at present in Australia ?
—3762. • _ .
(1) Cierva C3OP. Direct control. This
machine is the latest type. (2) No information
available. (3) Minimum flying speed, 15 m.p.h.
Area required for landing, circle 100 yards
diameter. (4) Take-off run, 70-85 yards.
(5) 95 m.p.h. (6) Reliability is equal to that
of any other type of single-engined aircraft.
(7) There is one, owned by the Autogyro
Corporation of Australia, 341 Collins-street,
Melbourne.
1 have been told that the jelly in tinned
tongues, meats, etc., is a kind of seaweed. What
is its commercial name and where can it be
obtained retail? —4318.
A jelly known as agar-agar is prepared from
a seaweed, and is used by Eastern races in
soups and other cookery. You might be able
to procure it by getting in touch with a mer-
chant or consul in Java or Singapore. The
jelly used in Australian canning is gelatine,.
procurable from all grocers in powdered form.
Cookery books explain its various uses.
Method of cleaning and polishing seashells,
including mother-of-pearl ?—-4223.
Boil the shells in 1 gal. of water in which has
been dissolved 2oz. soft soap and a pinch
of caustic soda. Scrub well, then polish with
a toothbrush dipped in hydrochloric acid and
then with dry whiting. Drop the shells into
cold water, leave for one hour, drain, and
dry in heated sawdust. Give a final rub with
a chamois.
How to make a small quantity of citron
peel ? —4038.
Lake six citrons, cut them in halves length-
wise, scoop out the pulp and pith, and boil
the skins in clean water until they are soft
enough to pierce with a knitting needle; they
should also be transparent. Boil up a syrup of
14-lb. sugar to pints water, then pour this
over the drained peel, which should have been
set out on a large meat-dish. Every day for
six days boil up the syrup and pour again over
the peel, which should then be well candied;
add a little more sugar and water daily if the
syrup grows less by evaporation. Finally drain
the peel well of syrup, roll it in castor sugar,
and store in jars with covers.
How can I make rubber solution out of old
inner tubes?- —4187.
Solution is made by cutting rubber into
small pieces and dissolving in carbon disulphide,
benzol or gasoline. There are many processes
and formulas.
(1) Would the temperature of the air in the
lee of a house be regarded as the true tem-
perature of a locality ? (2) If the thermometer
was exposed in the open away from tlje house
would it reflect the true air temperature ?
4068.
(1) No. The house would have a disturbing
influence on the terrestrial radiation near it,
and this in turn would affect the temperature
of the air in the vicinity. Further, the air may
be affected by radiation of heat from the
house itself, particularly if it is built of brick
or stone. (2) Yes.
Following addresses required: (1) Institute
of. Metals, London ? (2) Society of Chemical
Industry, London ? (3) Society of Chemical
Industry, Victoria ? (4) Chemicals employed
in freezing-machines which operate by the
application of heat ? —4300.
(1) 36 Victoria-st., London, S.W.I. (2) 46-47
Finsbury-sq., London, E.C.2. (3) Cannot trace
the name. Try Chemical Institute (Aust.),
Victorian Branch, 55 Collins-place, Melbourne,
C.l. (4) In one type of apparatus operating
on this principle, heat is applied to a boiler
containing a solution of ammonia in water,
the ammonia being expelled from solution
in gaseous form and then condensed to liquid
by cooling in water. The liquid ammonia
enters an .evaporator located in the ice-chest
and there evaporates to reduce temperature.
Particulars of the will of the late Mrs. Eliza-
beth Kirby, who bequeathed her estate for the'
benefit of returned soldiers ? —4467.
It is not possible here to give the full text
of the will, but, briefly, the whole of the income
and capital of the estate is willed for the relief
of necessitous returned soldiers and their
widows, children and grandchildren (born
during the lifetime of the ex-soldier) who may
be necessitous; i.e., those earning only the
basic wage or not possessed of more than
£2OO. The necessitous returned soldier to
benefit must have been actually in action in
some theatre of war during 1914-18, and must
be either a native-born Australian or the son
of a father born in England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland or N. S. Wales, and must be vouched
for as sober and industrious by the chief police
officer in the district in which he resides. Any
necessitous returned soldier coming within the
category of those who may benefit under the
will, or any child of a returned soldier de-
sirous of benefiting, must either have had ex-
perience on the land or be the child of a
father who had such experience. Testatrix
directs that the amount to be applied for the
benefit of any one individual shall be
determined by the trustee, but shall not exceed
£5OO. Such sum shall be expended by the
trustee on the purchase of virgin land, unfenced
and unenclosed, in N. S. Wales, not less than
50 miles from the Sydney G.P.0.; it is to be let
to the person it is intended to benefit at a
rental of one peppercorn p.a., the tenant paying
rates and taxes and other outgoings. There is.
provision in the will that tenants shall not bene-
fit from improvements-made to the land unless
they satisfy the trustee as to reasons for leav-
ing. The trustee is enjoined to complete dis-
tribution of the estate, capital and income, at
the expiration of 20 years after the death of the
last survivor of returned soldiers who at the
date of her death should be in receipt of a
pension. Distribution is then to be of the fee
simple of the land to the occupants and of
cash to them in equal shares.
(1) Approximate value of bronze coronation
medals of William IV., George IV. and Vic-
toria, in good condition ? (2) How to dis-
pose of them ? (3) l have also a silver crown,
obverse, ' Victoria; reverse, MDCCCXLVII;
inscription, LUCATUR-UNITADEUS; and
royal arms. A small number of these were
struck for private distribution. Is it of any
value ?— 4400.
(1) Value varies according to size. If the
medals,are of the largest size (about two inches
in diameter) and in absolute Mint condition
their collector value would be about ss. each.
If they are of smaller size, then value will be
less accordingly. There is very little demand
from collectors. (2) Send them to one of the
currency exchanges (names and addresses in
daily press). (3) This is the Gothic crown. These
coins were struck for the currency, but were
never put into circulation. They therefore be-
came pattern crowns, of- which large numbers
were struck for collectors. First-class specimens
are worth about 12s. 6d. Specimens are
always available, and can be landed here from
England, postage paid, for the amount stated.

Dear Sirs,
Some time ago 1 was troubled with nasty
bitter fluid arising from my stomach, and
disliked my food. 1 went to see my doctor,
but instead of getting better I got worse. I
could get no relief. I was in continual pain
and soon had to cease my work and take to
my bed. I spent any amount of money on
different medicines, but nothing did me any
good. I was sent to hospitr#, where an opera-

De Witt’s Antacid Powder acts in a
commonsense way. Firstly, it im-
mediately neutralises the excess acidity,
the root of the whole trouble. At the
same time, it coats the stomach walls
with a thin, soothing film of colloidal
kaolin, so that the inflamed tissues are
protected from the burning acid. One
ingredient of DeWitt’s Antacid Powder
actually digests a portion of your food
so that the tired stomach is enabled
to “pick up.”

We make a free offer of a generous
sample of De Witt’s Antacid Powder
to every sufferer from digestive troubles.
When you have tried the sample, we

“Contact”: A few months ago The
Bulletin was the only authority which
was enjoying a laugh at the idea of a 12-

Australia. Now, the whole world is
laughing. The latest guffaw comes from

enced aerial organisers in the world and

“H Vecchio”: These reformers who
sponsor eugenic marriage are a thought-
less lot. One of them, Lord Kilmaine,
an Irish peer, has been trying to swing
the House of Lords in favor of a graded
scheme under which doctors would issue
four types of certificate: (1) All clear,
(2) marriage should be delayed, (3) mar-
riage must be childless, (4) not fit to
marry. It is a lovely ideal. But, in the
first place, most of the people who were
refused certificates would ignore the
ceremony. In the second place, it
wouldn’t be long, seeing what our poli-
tical system is, before marriage would
become a class matter, like drinking after
six o’clock. Lastly, thousands of the
types that breed brains would be told to
remain sterile because of physical defi-
ciencies, while the types that produce
brawn would be told to multiply. Of
course, where it is a matter of organic
disease or v.d. or insanity it is different;
but it is hard enough to tell what a man
! will turn out after he is born much less
before. Many a public idol rises out of
a sickly youth.

“Gunner”: So the Arsenal is to be
moved “from its exposed position in the
heart of London.” The reason given in
the cable is that it offers “an easy target)
to hostile aircraft.” A fatal objection. |
In the final stages of the war over
100,000 men and women were working j
on munitions in the Woolwich area. The i
British people know the Arsenal chiefly;
as the home of a crack Soccer XI; to
the warlords of Europe it is England’s)
greatest torpedo, gun and ammunition
factory. But if the Arsenal goes inland
what justification is there for retaining
any of London’s essential services? The
water supply, for example, which might
be cut a few miles to the north. It is
the Empire’s misfortune that, in face of
tremendous aircraft improvements since
the German raids of 15 years ago, Lon-
don has been rapidly attracting factories
from the midlands and industrial north.
The Port has proved an irresistible mag-
net, and most of London’s new wealth is
where it could be most easily destroyed
by an invader from the other side of the
Channel —namely, east of the Temple.
About the safest site for England’s capi-
tal these days would be in the neigh-
borhood of Carlisle.

PREPARING THE CAR FOR HOLIDAY
TOURING.
WHAT TO TAKE AND WHAT TO LEAVE BEHIND.
BY FRED BERRY.
A USTRALIAN motorists are at this time of the year looking
forward with a keen anticipation to the Christmas holidays,
and if registrations in the various States can be taken as a
criterion there will be more cars on the highways this year in
quest of recreation than for many years past. In fact, every-
thing points to 1934 setting up record figures so far as motoring
holiday tours are concerned.
With petrol at a comparatively low
price and touring and camping equip-
ment made by specialists available on
hire at a cheap rate, car-owners should
realise that a vacation taken by car is
cheaper than when any other method of

transport is adopted, is faster than most
and gives freedom from any rigid
schedule of times.
Before going into details of prepara-
tion there is one aspect of touring that
is worthy of thought. Many motorists
have permitted themselves to get into a

points requiring inspection: Brake-pedal

ments and position of linings.
rut and go year after year to the same
familiar places, over the same roads,
without realising the enormous possibili-
ties for education and experience open to
them in this wonderful country. Over-
seas visitors express their belief that
here we have scenery and climate to
equal the most famous of Old-World
tourist resorts, and all this is to be had
for a few gallons of petrol. Modern cars
are so reliable that a thousand-mile tour
is no longer a hazardous adventure, but
means just so many hours of interesting
driving. Provided reasonable care is
exercised at the beginning, a trouble-free
run is certain.
Careful Preparation.
Let us then see what should be done
in preparing the car in order to assure
this happy state of affairs, for every
motorist would rather carry out repairs
or adjustments in his own garage, and
at his leisure, than be forced to do them
on the open road to the almost certain
inconvenience of all concerned.
It must be borne in mind that during
a long country tour skilled assistance may
be difficult, if not impossible, to secure,
and that driving for long periods at high
speeds over indifferent highways will de-
velop latent defects in engine, tyres and
transmission much more rapidly than
would be the case when operating
sedately over paved city roads on short
runs.
Dealing first with the engine, we must
assume that compression is good, valves
are seating well and bearings and piston-
rings not unduly worn, otherwise it would
be foolish to venture far from home.
Having decided this major issue, we must
carefully inspect all accessories. Check
fan-belt tension and see that the belt
has not stretched to the limit, otherwise,
driving (as it usually does) generator,
fan and water impeilor, we may soon be
in distress. If any doubts exist don’t
adopt half-measures, but fit a new belt—
it will last many thousand miles and
means but a small outlay in comparison
with the total of running expenses.
A Cool Motor.
Next on the list is the cooling system.
See that both top and bottom hose con-
nections are free from cracks and that
clips are firmly in place. Flush the radi-
ator out with one of the many com-
pounds available to remove rust from
radiator core and water passages round
cylinders and valves. This done, fear of
boiling, even on the hottest day or
steepest climb, may be laid aside.
With regard to the fuel and induction
system, it would be a good plan to first
remove the drain plug from beneath the
petrol tank in order to clear of sludge,
water and other impurities that are sure
to accumulate after a season’s running.
Examine the fuel line, particularly at
unions, for leaks. Dismantle the filters
and clean them thoroughly before replac-
ing. Incidentally, where the “glass-
bowl” type of settling filter is fitted in
conjunction with a mechanical fuel pump
one must be careful when dismantling
for cleaning purposes to see that the cork
gasket is free from cracks and that when
the bowl is replaced it fits neatly and
firmly in position, care being taken to
ensure a perfect seal.
Whilst on the motor a cursory inspec-
tion of the electrical equipment must not
be overlooked, for although generator,
plugs, battery and other electrical de-
tails go along like the brook when
driving around the cities they have an
unhappy knack of playing pranks when
the nearest electrician is a hundred
miles away.
The Vital Spark.
Even though the motor appears to be
firing on all cylinders there is no assur-
ance that after 15,000 miles it will con-
tinue the good work. Experience has
proved that at about this distance all
electrical gear should be overhauled.
Plugs, although apparently sound, may
be shorting internally, and consequently
may break down at any time. Have them
tested under compression, and where
any doubt exists fit a new set. Slip the
cover plate from the generator and
starter motor, inspect the brush-holders,
remove carbon and thoroughly clean the
commutator, and place a few drops of

thin oil in each
bearing. Check
the charging rate
by running the
car at between
20 and 40 m.p.h.,
and make the
necessary adjust-
ment by moving
the third brush
on the generator.
As the battery
is usually located
in a most inac-
cessible position
it is seldom given
attention, but be-
fore starting out
on a tour it
would be a good
plan to test the
battery acid with
a hy d r ometer.
With the electro-
lyte iin. above the plates this test
should show a specific gravity of
between 1.260 and 1.300 for full charge.
Terminals must be examined, cleaned
where necessary and the earth lead to the
chassis inspected, for unless this is clean
and making good contact with the metal
frame the battery cannot function effici-
ently.
Passing now to transmission details,
it will only be necessary to renew oil
in both gearbox and differential and
make sure of correct levels. At the same
time drain out the oil in the sump (do
this when the motor is warm) and re-
place with fresh oil, flushing first with
a quart of new oil. Never make the
mistake of flushing the crankcase with
kerosene or benzine, for it may do a
great deal of damage to bearings.
Out of Sight.
When touring through * unfamiliar
country the problem of fuel supply is
sometimes a source of anxiety, so the
fuel gauge should be carefully calibrated
before commencing the tour. In those
cases where a column of red liquid is
used in dashboard instruments* and
readings are inaccurate by reason of
evaporation, the defect can only be recti-
fied by refilling with special telegauge
liquid.
Calibration of electrical dashboard
gauges should be carefully checked by
emptying the fuel tank and refilling a
gallon at a time, reading the dial and

bly, showing adjusting nut for shoe ten-
sion and (lower) direction of rotation

system is also shown.
noting the position of the indicator.
Although this may appear at first sight
to be a rather tedious and possibly un-
necessary process, yet, as readings are
correct throughout the complete range,
once having made the check and noted
any variation the motorist will know
definitely his reserve of fuel at any stage
of the journey.
Brake Efficiency.
Brakes and tyre equipment must next
be given attention. Good brakes, acting
evenly and smoothly, are a splendid in-
surance against accident when touring in
strange country. Brake lining and brake
adjustment have now become highly
specialised in the larger cities, and one
could with advantage have the whole
work done by specialists. Failing
this, one should make sure that where
mechanical equipment is fitted the
adjustment of rods has not been taken
to the limit, otherwise, after descending
a few steep hills, you will almost cer-
tainly find that the brake pedal will
touch the floor without stopping the car —
a most uncomfortable predicament. The
shrewd motorist will inspect these adjust-
ments before setting out, and have new
linings fitted rather than take an unneces-
sary risk.

THE STEERING COLUMN
Tyres must now be considered, and
in this connection we may compare them
with our footwear. Almost any shoe
will fill the bill when walking on city
pavements, but on a long walk the wearer
runs a risk of being crippled unless his
footwear is exactly right. It’s the same
with tyres. If the breaker-strip is show-
ing through the tread one of two things
must be done—retreads or new covers.
Retreads are cheaper, but so many
companies will to-day retread any cover,
however faulty, that motorists would be
well advised to be cautious in making
a final decision. Should, however, re-
treading be decided upon, be sure to
take the work to a well-established firm
which will stand behind the job and give
a guarantee of service.
Spares and Tool Kit.
After completing arrangements with
regard to treads, give attention to inner
tubes. Remove casings, pull out tubes,
inspect patches and make sure repairs
are sound. Scrape the rust from the in-
side of wheel rims, paint over with
enamel and, when replacing tubes, dust
lightly with French chalk, making sure
at the same time that canvas strip be-
tween tube and rim is sound and free
from buckles.
•Having attended to these details, the
final job will be looking over the tool
kit. With the modern car it is a mis-
take to load up with all manner of
spares. As a general rule all that is
needed are a good jack, a serviceable
tyre pump, two spare plugs, a pair of
headlight globes, hammer, screwdriver,
adjustable spanner and a tyre-repair
outfit. As an extra precaution in the
event of trouble at night, a hand torch or
a light connectable at the dashboard
might well be included.
Motor Oddities.
“Gypsos”: Old Joe Crater, well-off
and hayseedy, wanted to buy a car; but
he would have none of the local dealer.
He took the train lo Melbourne, 350
miles away, and returned in a 6-eyl.
Chev. He blew into the local garage,
full of complaints. He knew he was not
to exceed 25 miles per hour, but he
couldn’t get anything like that out of
her. “Hop in, and take us for a spin,”
said the local lad. Joe got under way,
and off they went. For a mile each
surveyed the other with expectant looks.
“When’re yer goin’ to change gears,
Joe?” murmured Spanners. “Cripes,”
blurted Joe, “I fergot all about it.” He
had come 350 miles in first gear.

devoted by the newspapers to the floats
in the gala pageant staged in Sydney on

bly are difficult to remove with-
out special appliances. Simple

the day of the Duke of Gloucester’s
arrival, no mention was made of the poor
cows who drove the floats. Beneath a
mass of decorations no portion of the
chassis of their machines was noticeable.
Vision was secured through slits, only
an inch or two high and a few inches
wide, in the front of the floats. What
ventilation there was must have been
well-nigh stifled by the smell of papier
mache, paint and pink roses. Talk about
driving under difficulties!
* * Ht if:
“Monty": Dave Worrall, former New-
castle (N.S.W.) journalist and now head
of 3DB Broadcasting Station in Mel-
bourne, spent a couple of years in
U.S.A. At ’Frisco he bought a used Ford
for 150 dollars and drove it across the re-
public by a zigzag route, visiting Niagara
Falls and witnessing the Kentucky Derby.
Arriving in New York he drove to an
address in Brooklyn, and had no sooner
stepped to the pavement than a cop came
up. “You can’t park that car there,” he
ordered. “I’m not parking it, I’m scrap-
ping it. It’s no use to me any more.”
The cop glanced over the machine. “Give
you 100 dollars for it,” he said. “Sure,”
replied Worrall, who had learned the
language on the trip across. “Leave it
there and I’ll bring along the money to-
morrow,” said the cop, continuing his
beat.

“Lignum”: 1 was examining a worn
spot on the tread of the front tyre when
it blew out; I thought at the time my
sight was gone for ever. The doctor who
saved my eyesight by collecting particles
of sand, blue metal, canvas threads and
the like, with the help of a camel-hair
brush and cocaine, from my eyeballs,
described their pitted surface as being a
good imitation of “no-man’s land” on the
Somme front after a bombardment. I
still shudder whenever I see the canvas
showing on the tread of a worn tyre.

“Klutch”: On a recent evening a man
parked his ancient and battered car in

E.N.K. (Blayney, N.S.W.). — My 6-cyl. car
has recently been rebored and oversize pistons

to be a difference of opinion even among ex-
perienced motor mechanics.
If no other alteration has been made to
combustion chamber and pistons are same
length as the originals, compression ratio has
been increased, for the larger bore will draw
a greater volume of gas into the cylinder to
be compressed into the original combustion
head.

What is wrong ?
Almost certainly the whistle comes from an
air leak somewhere in the induction system.

And So The Holden Story Grew
• Who would have thought that the Saddlery
and Leather business established by Holden’s
fifty years ago would be the genesis of one of
our important secondary industries? In 1917,
when the firm was engaged in coach-building,
the first Holden motor body was produced. In
subsequent years the annual production of
Holden bodies has reached as high as 45,000.
The South Australian plant at Woodville alone
covers 40 acres, and employs 3,200 Australians.
Recognised as of a quality that equals the
world’s best, the products of this vast plant are
a tribute indeed to the craftsmanship of the
Holden organisation. That is one reason why
“Body by Holden” should be part of the
description of your next car ... for those three
words ensure that your money buys the most in
beauty, comfort, and extra durability under
Australian conditions. There are other reasons,
too . . . for every good Australian is interested
in a secondary industry which uses Australian
materials, employs Australians and distributes
profits to Australian shareholders.

all joints and gaskets while engine is running
and watch for oil surface breaking. You will
probably need to use a mirror to test underside
of induction manifold.
B.S. (Ballarat, Vic.).— -The rear axle housing
of my 1926 Chev. gets very hot after a long
run. Crown wheel and pinion adjustment has
been checked, but as oil in differential has
been leaking through to brake drums it has
been replaced with thick grease. Would this
cause overheating ?
Yes. The only certain remedy would be to
renew the bearings and oil-retaining washers on
the axle shafts and replace grease with gear
or engine oil.
R.M. (Ipswich, Q.). — The brakes on my
old bullnose Morris-Cowley -squeak badly, par-
ticularly after wet weather. Is there any cheap
remedy ?
If linings on shoes have become shiny and
brittle a few drops of castor oil might effect
a cure, but more probably the trouble is due
to resonance of the light drums. Make a
strong steel band to fit outside each drum, and
before tightening up insert a strip of leather
between band and drum.
A.B.C. (New Farm. Q.). —7 have recently
taken delivery of a 1934 car fitted with auto-
matic clutch. I had always understood it was
a bad policy to coast with clutch out. Will
1 do any harm by using the automatic clutch
continuously ?
Bearings and mechanism in your car have
been specially designed to withstand continuous
and heavy duty. Recent inspection of one
of these cars after 45,000 miles showed no
appreciable wear in transmission or clutch.
Vaux. (Coogee, N.S.W.). — On my new car
a vernier adjustment is fitted to the distributor
in addition to automatic advance and retard.
Should not the automatic spark control be
sufficient ?
Under ordinary driving conditions yes, but
if you desire maximum efficiency from your
engine a few turns one way or the other of
the vernier control will make a definite im-
provement in handling different grades of fuel.
Curious (Bathurst, N.S.W.). — Will you ex-
plain why so many cars are described with two
engine-powers such as 14/40, and which one
is correct ?
First figure indicates approximately the old-
fashioned R.A.C. rating which, while having no
bearing upon actual pow'er output, is used in
England for taxation purposes. The latter (40)
figure is the actual brake-horsepower developed
by the motor at peak revs, under perfect con-
ditions.
A.P.T. (Mtidgee, N.S.W.). — My new car is
fitted with a free-wheeling attachment, and l am
delighted with petrol economy and silent run-
ning, but when driving up a difficult hill at
speed 1 don’t seem to handle the corners as
well as in the older model with fixed gear.
Reason ?
Suggest that you do all fast touring with
free-wheeling attachment in “fixed” position.
You have been accustomed to the engine acting
as a brake in the old type immediately the
foot is lifted from the accelerator. With free-
wheeling the car runs on and consequently
pace on corners is more difficult to control.
W.T.B. (Warren, N.S.W.). —7 have had a
new car for nearly four months, and have
never driven faster than 40 m.p.h. Now it
has thoroughly run in maxmum speed is only
45 m.p.h., after which the motor pops and heats
up. Have checked valves and ignition and still
the trouble persists. Can you help ?
With a practically new car symptoms point
to fuel shortage, and the car should reach a
maximum of at least 65 m.p.h. Check fuel
lines and see if one of the pipes has not been
kinked, so causing partial stoppage of supply
to the pump.

Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom centre in
technical or abstract features, but rather in personal experiences or
achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over specified
routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the present mechanical
condition of cars after years of use are matters of extreme interest. Huge
annual mileages, old driving licenses, and perhaps low car numbers support
claims to experience, while many drivers, with characteristic Australian
ingenuity, have made interesting emergency repairs.
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver covers the
greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been confined to
racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic, hundreds of miles from
repair shops, has worked miracles in order to get the car home.

WAVE-BANDS AND THEIR
CHARACTERISTICS.-
BY DON B. KNOCK.
With the public using all-wave' re-
ceivers, considerable mystification exists
because of the apparently peculiar be-
havior of overseas stations. They may
be heard distinctly, poorly or not at all,
or may be audible only at varying times.
There is nothing of the reliable nature of
the 200- to 600-metre broadcasting waves
about the short waves. Yet they are in-
triguing because they can and do pro-
vide entertainment which thrills because
of distance.
It is now fairly well known that the
amateur transmitter, at least he of
pioneer days, had most to do with the
development of short-wave radio com-
munication. Before the amateur had per-
force to make good use of his short
waves (being ordered off the longer
waves), fading was not understood. The
sole idea of achieving DX transmis-
sion was power, and plenty of it. “In-
crease the ground-wave and overcome
the earth’s absorption,” said radio en-
gineers of early days. To a certain ex-
tent, related to long-wave broadcasting
(1000 to 2000 metres) the idea is sound,
but there are limits to power and dis-
tance, and engineers were then only con-
cerned with telegraphic communication.
The amateur used simple apparatus on
his short waves, and broke down the
barriers of distance easily, thus opening
a new and unexplored field in radio.
As short-wave bands were taken over
for commercial communication, the urge
to try something else took the amateur
to still shorter wave-lengths. Now a con-
siderable amount of work is being done
on five metres and actual use is made of
micro-waves. Marconi, the man who
blazed the first useful radio trail, is doing
remarkable things with micro-waves. It
is possible to produce these electro-mag-
netic waves in the whole range, down to
visible light. The radiated energy is
small, and, with the usual kind of valve
as an oscillation generator, difficulties are
experienced with tuned circuits. New
valves have been produced recently in
which the generated wave-length is de-
termined by the dimensions and placing
of the elements and the applied voltage.
Waves of five centimetres have been pro-
duced thus.
Explaining the Spectrum.
Long waves are those extending from
30,000 metres or more to about 800
metres. The important feature is that
there is practically no sign of fading.
Atmospheric disturbances are very
troublesome because such disturbances
are themselves mostly of low frequency.
With long waves, the reliable communi-
cation range is between 1000 and 6000
miles, and' the distance decreases in pro-
portion to the wave-length.
There is a great deal to be said for
broadcasting on the long waves, despite
atmospherics. The medium wave-band
is from 800 to 150 metres approximately,
and here the fading effects become worse
as the frequency is increased. Ranges of
communication vary from 1000 miles at
800 metres to 200 miles at 160 metres.
Getting into the short-wave band between
100 and 10 metres, the phenomenon
described as “skip distance” becomes
prominent. The ground-wave at 100
metres covers about eight miles, yet com-
munication can be effected up to 1200
miles or more because of the presence
of the reflected wave from the Heaviside
An absorption wave-meter is a useful
accessory for the short-wave fan. This
one, being for use in an experimental
transmitting station, is fitted with a neon
indicator.
layer, the supposed reflecting medium
enclosing the earth’s stratosphere. At
40 metres signals are heard from 0 to
40 miles and from 400 to 4000 miles. The
“skip distance” is between these points
where the ground-wave is absorbed com-
pletely and where reflection back to
earth occurs.
Ultra-short Regions.
The ultra-short waves begin at about
eight metres, and here the upward rays
are not reflected, but pass through the
medium and are presumably lost in
space. The ground-wave then becomes
the only useful component, and obeys
more or less optical laws, and travels
straight to the horizon. The limitation of
these waves is actually their claim to use-
fulness. Different stations do not inter-
fere with each other, even if very close
in frequency. Ultra-short waves can be
directed in any required direction and
focussed by reflector systems much in
the same way as a light beam. They are
not affected by fog, rain or fading, and
they are of infinite value in short-range
secret channels of communication. Tele-
phone services in many parts of the
world are augmented by ultra-short-wave
links as part of the network. “Micro-
waves” is the definition given to the
present extreme limit of frequencies, i.e.,
below one metre. Much successful work
is being done in these regions, and they
offer big possibilities for future develop-
ment. One important application is
short-range television, but there are other
possible uses too numerous to mention,
The wave-range table given here sum-
marises the radio spectrum and gives a
fair idea of the characteristics and
general behavior of the various wave-
bands.
THE SEARCH ETERNAL.
Sometimes it may have happened, dear
reader, that, being out of bed in the small
hours of the morning, keeping a vigil,
perchance, for some stay-out-late daugh-
ter or grandmother, you have, with but
little hope of finding any broadcasting
station still erupting, turned on the radio
switch and slowly swept the dial from
0 to 100. If you have done so, you
probably have heard at various wave-
lengths (I think that’s the right technical
term) a sort of monotonous shrill piping
like a lost soul with the toothache. Being
conversant with those talkies that depict
Arctic explorers mingling with Eskimos,
igloos, kayaks and polar bears on deso-
late icefloes, and sending out despairing
last messages on a radio set that makes
a noise like a steam siren, you. imme-
diately recognise this for what it is—a
telegraphic message—and you idly wish
you could read Morse. And that is prob-
ably as far as you get. You spare no
thought for the sender of that message,
sitting up when all the last trams have
gone to wherever they go, when wives
have gone to bed and the fire (if it hap-
pens to be winter) has gone out.
You hear him communing in some-
what halting Morse with some kindred
spirit in the next suburb or in Tim-
buctoo, and you never say to yourself
“Now, why does he do that?” You do
not reflect that had it not been for stern-
minded, devoted men who scorned their
beds and lived laborious nights, their
minds fixed on impedances, inductions,
rectifications and frequencies, the
mechanism of radio would never have
reached its present high pitch of audi-
bility. And if you do reflect that (I wish
to be fair) you probably say to yourself
that it would have been a darned good
job if they hadn’t. It is in such an atmo-
sphere of indifference, if not of positive
hostility, that the amateurs of radio pur-
sue their dark researches. To alter this
undesirable condition of the public mind
is the purpose of this essay.
“To know all,” said a philosopher
whose name I forget, “is to forgive all.”
At the outset of my mission, which is
to cast a searchlight on the lives of
home-set-constructors, short-wave experi-
menters and all that ilk, I am faced with
the difficulty that these nocturnal crea-
tures cannot speak more than a very few
words concerning their experiences and
adventures without resorting to a jargon
that no outsider can follow, thus veiling
with mystery their art and craft, as is
the manner of doctors and lawyers and
professors of phrenology. But I have
elicited something regarding the genesis
of radio amateury. I have questioned
many experimenters, and in nearly every
case I find that instincts of frugality first
impelled them. Horror-stricken at the
prices of even the most humble of
modern receiving sets, they have invested
in (I quote from a catalogue) “one glass-
enclosed Detector with Crystal and Cat’s-
whisker, complete, 3s. 6d.” I often
wonder why the radio dealers, instead
of charging from 3s. 6d. to 455. (this
latter price brings to your door an “all-
station crystal set, in cabinet, with
chart”) for these appliances, don’t dis-
tribute them free, or hire the most per-
suasive of go-getters to force them on
the with the aid of free beer
or buckshee lottery tickets, for once a
normal human being has fiddled around
with a cat’s-whisker he is never the same
again. In no time at all he is entirely
surrounded by condensers, transformers,
vernier dials, potentiometers, batteries
and valves of all descriptions, and, though
previously he may have got through life
with no more aids to handicraft than a
hammer and a packet of nails, he accu-
mulates the varied paraphernalia of a
young factory so that he may string these
contraptions together in countless com-
binations and permutations.
His path is bestrewn with difficulties,
but these make him the more deter-
mined. The materials and the myriad
gadgets used in radio seem to have been
designed with the sole object of dis-
couraging their use. Anybody not a
radio-addict who has tried to cut a sheet
of bakelite or separate the parts of a
4-pin plug will understand, however
dimly, what I mean. Instead of being
deterred by these obstacles, the indivi-
dual with the radio virus in his blood
greets them with a whoop of joy. From
cat’s-whiskers he moves on to thermionic
valves and superheterodynes, goes in
for short waves, and when these pall
takes up transmitting. This is the final
stage, and once it is attained there is
no looking back. Give a transmitting
amateur 1000 years of life, and at the
end of it you would find him in his bath-
chair endeavoring to establish communi-
cation with the satellites of Betelgeuse
or drawing a diagram of his 8567th
micro-wave generator.
And what of it? The radio amateurs
do nobody any harm; the amount of
mischief they keep themselves out of if
placed end to end would girdle Sheol ;
and they avoid boredom, the father of
all devils. Every now and then one of
them is able to add a little bit more to
the sum of knowledge, and if there is
any worthier aim than that available to
the ordinary unsaintly human I haven’t
heard of it.

but we’ve got so “commercialised” that
there is no end of receivers on the
market, even by reputable makers, that
can hardly struggle through the guaran-
tee period, and quietly go to pieces.

sockets do give trouble. But I can’t
get a can tall enough to cover the valve
when in this type of socket, because the
socket protrudes half an inch above the
chassis. Mr. Can Man doesn’t provide
cans to suit that socket. Bush luck, I
suppose. About all-wave switches again.
Funny thing happened the other day.
Maybe the dispatching firm thought it
funny, but I didn’t. Friend ordered an
all-wave switch. After a week a parcel
arrived —rather heavy for a switch.
Out fell an audio transformer. Investi-
gation showed that the “outward-bound”
clerk had mixed things. Another fellow
away in Woop Woop got the switch.
Took a month to get things right. Mean-
while a sale was lost. More profanity.
Oh for the crystal-set days!
Yet things happened even then. Over
in W.A. when 6WF first went on the
air I made a crystal set for a lady.
Tested it and found it O.K. Lady called,
took it, and said she understood how to
connect up. Telephone rings. Set is
mute. Go over to inspect. “Where is
your earth connection?” says I. “Why,”
says she demurely, “outside the window
in the flower-pot!”
Then the B-battery business. One
somehow couldn’t convince the user that
it did batteries no good to lay a screw-
driver or a pair of scissors across the
top. Suppose it was good business for
the battery people, but now they’ve got
cardboard covers on batteries with a real
kick. That’s one thing that is good—the
modern B battery.

Country Short-wave Explorations.
There has been a further approach to
summer conditions and early-morning
reception is much better.
In the 19-metre band the early riser
will find WBXK now very good from
5 a.m. until closing about 6.30. W2XAF,
a little lower in the band, is not very
audible yet, but improving, and in the
20-metre amateur band a number of
Americans on ’phone are coming
through at the same hour.
In the 31-metre band both W2XAU
and WIXAZ are fine strength, GSB is
fair, and DJA will no doubt appear there
shortly.
In the 25-metre band, except for im-
proved strength in the case of FYA,
there is not much to look for from
Europe, but WBXK is now very good
around 7 a.m.
REN (45 metres) is heard clearly
about 6 a.m., but closes at 6.20. This
station sends out fine music around
5.30 a.m.
For the very early riser, 7LO (49.5)
and DJC (49.8) are quite good, and the
general noise level is low. Unfortunately
7LO closes at 5 a.m., whereas in former
years this station went on until 6 a.m.
There are also a number of weak Ameri-
cans in the same band, hardly audible
yet.
Evening conditions do not show much
change. GSB, in the No. 1 transmission
for Australia, is still easily best until 7
p.m., when strength falls to the level of
GSD. Dinner music from GSB has been
far ahead of the broadcast locals this
week. From the latter mostly noise and
static have been received, with some
music at intervals.
Later in the evening 19 metres comes
to life, with both FYA and GSF excel-
lent.
PCJ has not been heard except for a
weak carrier, and DJB is only fair. Later
in the evening GSE is very good, and
on a recent Sunday RNE (25), was at
full volume. The first speaker was an
Australian, and according to him all is
lovely in Soviet Russia’s garden. Prob-
ably he was shown the pretty part of
the garden.
In the 31-metre band DJA is excel-
lent, also GSB, which is in use in place
of GSC. Probably the interference
which was noted some weeks ago has
been reported to the 8.8. C., hence the
change. Both on the 25- and 31-metre
bands, it is noticed that signal strength
commences to drop after 12 p.m. on all
stations.
PHI has been excellent, with the old
announcer quite back to form. The
most outstanding feature on this band
is the return to excellent strength' after
2.30 p.m. of FYA (25.6), and this trans-
mission is extended to 3.45 p.m. on some
days. The reception after 3 p.m. is quite
equal to best in winter. WBXK also
excelled on Sunday, being good copy
from 2.30 till closing at 3 p.m.
The 40-metre amateur band is full
of life on Sundays as usual, but the
80-metre band has been given a wide
berth because of static, which is terrific
above 31 metres at night.

Short-wave News.
The German Consul-General for Australia passes on the
information concerning broadcasts from the German short-
wave stations. The special transmissions now taking place
on Sundays from 10 to 11.30, Central European time, from
the Reichsrundfunk-Gesellschaft at Berlin will now be merged
in a daily transmission. This commenced on December 1
from 9.45 —13.00 C.E.T., corresponding to 6.45 to 10.00
p.m. Sydney time. The wave-lengths and stations are DJB,
19.73 metres, and DJD, 25.51 metres, and the programme will
consist mainly of music, light entertainment and news. The
time schedule is as follows:

City Short-wave Explorations.
At the moment there is more for the
short-wave fan to listen to during the
evenings than ever before. The average
listener is not interested in waiting up
until one o’clock to hear an overseas
station, or in rising during the early
hours, but wants to hear stations between
7 p.m. and midnight. He is certainly
getting his money’s worth at present.
At seven o’clock, the Empire stations
GSB (31.55) and GSD (25.53) are both
coming through at splendid strength, and,
although they begin to fall off after 7.30,
usually prove excellent entertainment
until 8 p.m., when they close down.
At this hour, the Japanese station (44)
and the Russian station RVIS (70.2) pro-
vide plenty of interest until 9 p.m., when
the Empire station reopens with GSF
(19.82) and GSG. The former of these
two can now be relied upon to give first-
class entertainment almost every even-
ing. The signals are quite strong, free
from static, and the programmes have
shown a tremendous improvement over
those last year.
At 10 p.m. the French station FYA
(19.68) usually comes on the air with the
playing of “The Marseillaise,” and after
the news of the day in French, and later
in English, an excellent musical pro-
gramme can be heard. WIXAZ (31.35),
WBXAL (49.5) and the D.E.I. station
(49) are well worth listening to.
At eleven o’clock comes the best sta-
tion of them all, this being the German
station DJA (31.38), now giving all an-
nouncements in English as well as in
German. During the past week this
station has almost equalled any of the
local broadcasters in strength and clarity.
Surely, with such a wide choice of pro-
grammes, short-wave listening is no
longer experimental, but first-class enter-
tainment.
H. M. S.
Amateur Chatter.
The 14mc. band is now receiving a
goodly share of attention, and the hunt
for the elusive DX takes place each
evening. Around 10 p.m. VKSPZ, of
Kingston, Jamaica, puts in an appear-
ance regularly, and is fairly easy to con-
tact. He complains that VK’s-are often
submerged in the QRM from North
Americans. Many South Americans are
heard and worked at irregular intervals,
mostly by
VK3’s, and
most assuredly
by ZL’s. In
fact, there
seems to be
nothing that
our Maoriland
friends cannot
hear or work,
and often the
14mc. band is
so full of
them, in Syd-
ney at least,
that they
almost become
a nuisance!
Probably they
say the same
thing over
there about
VK’s. A few
Englishmen
have been
heard quite
early in the evening, but so far
the conditions of previous years,
with G’s at good strength around
11 p.m. and midnight, do not appear to
be repeated. Nevertheless, spasmodic
contacts with PA’s, ON’s and SM are
possible.
Great excitement prevailed with Syd-
ney 10-metre men on Sunday, 25 /11 / ’34.
Things began to happen. VK’s 488 and
4XN appeared with’ strong signals from
9 a.m. and were speedily contacted by
VK2HZ, VK2LZ and VK2NO. During
contact with VK2NO VK4BB broke off
and was heard to be working ZLIBA.
He explained subsequently that the
Maorilander’s signal swept across the
band strongly and he couldn’t resist
calling him! VK4BB had a great day,
and worked ZL, VK2, VK3 and VK6. At
VK2NO VK6SA was heard calling CQ
at 11 a.m. Replies brought no response,
and later in the evening VK6SA said he
only heard VK4BB and VK4XN. Shortly
after the surprise of hearing VK6SA
VK2NO was astonished to hear “CQ
de K6EWQ” at good strength. Frantic
calls in reply brought silence, and then
when K6EWQ was heard working LU7-
somebody it was realised that the signal
was a harmonic. If the actual 10-metre
harmonic is reaching Australia from
Honolulu it looks as if conditions may
be favorable for trans-Pacific work at
any time. Ten metres is useful, theoreti-
cally, for daylight only, but VK4BB has
been heard at 9 p.m. by VK2NO, and
vice versa, with VK4XN also logging
VK2NO. No VKs’s or VK3’s were heard
in Sydney on 25/11 / ’34, but a VK3 was
heard at 5 p.m. one evening previously;
this may have been a harmonic, as
no “CQ ten” was used. VK4BB reports
hearing J2IS. This is not surprising, as
the harmonics of JNB and JNJ are often
heard strongly. On the previous Sunday
morning VK2NO was answered by a
practical joker signing XA9, but the
joker didn’t reckon with an experienced
observer knowing the difference between
ground-wave and DX! VK2YC, the
Sydney 10-metre “sticker,” was heard
CQ-ing at intervals, and, altogether, the
indications are that anything may happen
on 10 metres in the next few week-ends.
There will certainly be an influx of
stations when the good news circulates.
Very interesting news is to hand about'
56mc., and, following on a statement in
a Sydney programme weekly that no-
thing much had been achieved in Aus-
tralia on this band, it comes at an oppor-
tune time. During this period of tem-
porary slackness on 5 for the past
eight months, VK2CG and VK2MW
have been steadily plodding along. Dur-
ing the week ending 17/11/’34, VK2XY
had a receiver at Katoomba, and logged
VK2CG on 5. VK2CG stated that
this was no surprise, for some weeks ago
he went off in a car to test range and,
leaving his transmitter running, logged
the signal at Waterfall, and at good
strength at Sutherland. This with ordi-
nary Pickard-type aerials. These results
recall pioneer work by VK2DY, who
logged 5-metre signals at' Bowral
(N.S.W.) from Sydney in 1928. With the
work done by a few enthusiasts in Syd-
ney, including the successful tests in 1933
between The Bulletin office and the
N.S.W. Police Department, and the ex-
cellent work of Syd Colville in aviation
at Mascot, it is not correct to say that
nothing has been achieved in this direc-
tion in Australia. There is much more
to come, however, and there is at least
one fearsome-looking 5-metre reflector
system under construction. More will
be heard of 5-metre work in N.S.W. in
the very near future.
In passing, there is another point con-
cerning incorrect operation that needs
attention, and this concerns telephony
stations. Many operators, in the course
of calling or working locals or otherwise,
will state merely that this is “Two So-
and-so.” This is not good enough. The
VK prefix must be used as well. It is
part of the actual callsign, and for a sta-
tion to leave out the prefix is a breach
of regulations. The reason for the pre-
fixing system is because short-wave
transmissions can be heard outside the
country of origin with ease, and some
immediate means of identification is de-
sirable. A man using 100 watts or more
of carrier power on telephony should
realise that, even if he is only concerned
with a fellow around the corner, he is
likely to be heard a few thousand miles
away.

Latest in the Trade.
Eastern Trading Co. issues engineer-
ing bulletin No. 13 dealing with the
latest Ken-Rad valve release. This is
the 6A6 Class-B twin amplifier, corres-
ponding to the type 53, but with a 6.3-
volt heater. The 6.3-type valves are
rapidly gaining favor over the 2.5-volt
types for receivers for use in the home,
and the 6A6 is produced to meet the
demand. It delivers 10 watts output with
300 volts on the plates at zero grid bias,
and as a Class-A amplifier, triodes in
parallel, will deliver .4 watts with 294
volts on the plates and 6 volts negative
bias on the grids. The base is the medium
seven pin. This valve would be useful
for the Regenerative Reflex All-wave re-
ceiver recently described in The Bulle-
tin, and would take the place of the 79
with alterations.

There is at the present stage of radio
ample room for improvement in air-
cored R.F. coils. Just to wind a speci-
fied number of turns on a moulded
former is not by any means the royal
road to maximum efficiency. R. J. Ray,
a radio engineer of long experience in
coil design, has recently effected improve-
ment in the standard form of air-core
coil. In the illustration the coil on the
left is the usual type, with close winding
and the primary over the secondary. The
one on the right, although similar in
appearance, is totally different. The
secondary is space-wound and the
primary is interwound with the second-
ary. Great care is taken in calibration
and insulation, and the windings are sub-
ject to a 1250-volt A.C. test. The samples
are from Standardised Products Co., 14
Hedger-avenue, Ashfield, Sydney.
Casual Comment.
Business is bad in radio, according
to many Sydney radio retailers. It
shouldn’t be, for there is more in-
terest in radio to-day than ever there
was. The all-wave receiver should be
one means of combating the so-called
summer slump, for anybody with a pen-
n’orth of knowledge about short waves
and their behavior during the few years
since international broadcasting com-
menced knows that they are at their best
in our Australian summer. The all-
wave receiver itself is not enough ; it
must be really efficient on all ranges,
and some are not. Also, it needs a sales-
man with the patience to educate a pros-
pective customer in the possibilities of
the short-wave side. A good radio sales-
man must have more than a mere smat-
tering of technicalities, otherwise he is
quite likely to lose his firm’s sales by
expecting an all-wave receiver to do its
stuff on the short waves with an earth
wire on the aerial terminal, and so on.
Too many radio traders are sitting down
on the job, expecting customers to walk
in as during the Test boom. With many
good all-wave models available, it
wouldn't do any harm to offer cus-
tomers the free erection of an efficient
aerial for the short-wave side wherever
possible.
* * * *
A Sydney radio journal, in an article
praising the ultra-short-wave research
work by Ross A. Hull, of “QST”
(U.S.A.) staff, concludes with the obser-
vation that very little has been achieved
in this direction locally. Hull is undoubt-
edly the outstanding pioneer in this work,
having at his disposal the fullest facilities
for investigation, and students of ultra-
short-wave phenomena the world over
owe much to his leadership. In Austra-
lia, however, the matter has not been •
neglected. During 1933 very successful
tests were conducted on 5 metres from a
station located on the roof of The
Bulletin offices, in conjunction with the
W/T branch of the N. S. Wales Police
Department. Communication was easily
established with co-operating amateur
stations in various Sydney suburbs. More
recently 5-metre transmissions from ex-
perimental station VK2CG, at Randwick
(Sydney), have been heard at Katoomba
and Waterfall (N.S.W.), and this without
any reflector systems. It is anticipated
that by using directional-radiating sys-
tems much greater distance will be cov-
ered, as in other countries. Experimenters
concerned with ultra-short waves in Aus-
tralia will not be slow to test thoroughly
the possibilities.
The Q. and A. Column.
I have recently acquired a variometer of
robust design in bakelite casing. Would this
be suitable for use in a crystal circuit ? —lB7.
Yes _ Diagram shows connections of the
variometer used as a tuner in conjunction with
a crystal detector and headphones. Though it
gives better signal gain than the usual coil/
condenser tuner, the variometer is quite in-
selective.
I am interested in a simple short-wave con-
verter for use with a battery receiver, and
understand that the new rype-\C6 valve is
better than the type-XAb for this purpose.
Please illustrate a diagram of a suitable arrange-
ment using the IC6 ? —lBB.
The diagram which appeared recently in
“Radio World” (U.S.A.) should be satisfactory.
The coil values as applied to the short-wave
superhet converters (B. 1 /8/’34) will be applic-
able.
In B. 25 /7 / ’34 you described a screened
aerial filter, and advised the use of honey-
comb coils for the transformers. Would it
be possible to use ordinary coils, as I have no
honeycombs ? —lB6.
Yes. Two standard solenoid-type coils for
the broadcast band will do. The eight-turn
coupling coils can be wound over these on a
layer of tape.

A Life Saved
In these days when, sadly enough, so
many deaths are announced as due to
aerial mishaps it is heartening to be able
to record a life saved by an aeroplane.
On 25/10/’34) a patient suffering from
a ruptured appendix was isolated by
hopelessly impassable rain-soaked roads
75 miles from Wilcannia. So heavy
was the track that, even if avail-
able, relays of horses and a light
vehicle could not have negotiated the
distance under 48 hours. Yet, in spite
of a choppy wind and damp landing-
grounds, the patient was landed, safely
and without jolting, within three hours
at the Wilcannia and District Hospital by
a light ’plane chartered from Bourke, 200
miles away. The lady was found to have a
margin of 12 hours this side of certain
death. Following an operation on
arrival, she has since recovered and been
discharged from hospital. — W. and D.
(Wilcannia).
These Taxgatherers
I’ve never paid income tax —never had
an income to warrant it—but this N. S.
Wales unemployment-relief tax —called
special income tax now —has got me
bothered. I run a small business, employ
three girls and clear, sometimes, £3 a
week for myself. If I were on salary
the tax would be taken out of it, and
everything would be all right. Being a
“capitalist” I get a bill for the lot at the
end of the year, and, of course, I’m
behind.
In the last three years I’ve paid over
£l6 in little bits, and I’ve communica-
tions from the department, on pink and
green forms, enough to paper a wall.
But, though the department says I can
have time to pay, it keeps on adding fines
for late payment —£2 15s 6d. so ,far.
That’s bad enough, but the latest “joke”
beats everything. I wrote offering £2
a month to clear up the debt, about £2O ;
where the £2 was coming from I didn’t
know, but they seemed to expect some-
thing. A few days ago I got this (green):
“Thirty shillings a month for three
months.” Now the same thing has
arrived on a pink form. What do they
want?—Y. Kik (N.S.W.).
Eut They’re Swift to Collect
A complaint was made by a Queens-
lander concerning a glaring overcharge
in stamp duty on an agreement. The
error was admitted orally by the taxation
people, and a written claim was sent in
on July 5. An acknowledgment was not
received until August 17 —it was dated
August 13 (distance, four miles). Silent
interval to October 15; then a settle-
ment was asked for. Another interval;
then an advice dated November 9 was re-
ceived —it' was delivered on November
13. Finally the belated cheque arrived
on November 17. It was dated November
14. Tortoises and tax departments are
notably persistent; but in this case the
department met its match. — Pertinax
(Q.).
Equality of Sacrifice?
In the latest year (1932-33) for which
the Commonwealth Commissioner of
Taxation furnishes particulars, 10,453
farmers paid income tax amounting to
£126,169 on £3,434,966 of taxable in-
come ; 3297 pastoralists paid £203,942
on £2,165,456 ; 2926 manufacturers paid
£739,314 on £11,391,076. Percentages to
taxpayer- and taxable-income totals
were: Farmers, 4.32 per cent, and 3.30
per cent.; pastoralists, 1.34 per cent, and
2.08 per cent.; manufacturers, 1.18 per
cent, and 10.94 per cent.
We hear a lot about equality of sacri-
fice. Do the foregoing returns suggest
that it has operated as between primary
and secondary industries? — Woolraiser
(N.S.W.).
Perils of a Property-owner
I bought a house in a Melbourne
suburb after making the usual inquiries
about rates owing. Before long I was
billed for excess water used by the pre-
vious owner. The reply to my letter
claiming non-liability was to the effect
that excess water was a charge upon the 1
property—wonderfully simple. Let us
extend the “principle.” If lam liable to
pay for ipy predecessor’s bathwater, why
not for his breakfast-food or his first
wife’s alimony?
The Government, in its effort to “burst
up the big estates,” imposed a land tax.
My 50ft. by 150 ft. apparently stands in
need of this salutary process (perhaps it
is that strip behind the fowl house not
put to adequate use), as I received a bill
for 4s. In my gross carelessness I failed
to pay, and this put the department on
its mettle. First it fined me 25 per cent,
interest; now it threatens to register the
debt against the title, which conjures up
visions of filing and production fees. It
savors of breaking a butterfly on the
wheel. — Casual Grower (Vic.).

“Grow More Wheat”
In the Vic. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Lukin gave a certificate of discharge to
Francis Barker, formerly a share-farmer.
Barker, who owed £l6BB, with £566
worth of assets, is an object-lesson in
latter-day economics. In fact, his plight
may be taken as the plight of civilisation
all the world over.
It was testified that when he started
farming in 1926 wheat was selling at 4s.
6d. a bushel and that it had since fallen
to Is. 9d., which explained everything.
To put it in another ioirn, Barker ha
borrowed or obtained credit toi £l6BB,
which in the commodity he Produced
represented roughly 6752 bushels 01.
eat< r ° liquidate this debt he c
£566, representing, equally roughly, 710(
bushels of wheat. In place ol a deffici-
ency he was showing a surplus and if
wheat, his own commodity, had been
legal currency he could have paid all
on with* SUffiC,ent ° Y
But, unfortunately, economics has little
to do with the monetary system. The
farmer who borrows money finds that the
lender won’t take wheat to liquidate the
debt. Money is the commodity of the
moneylender, and he demands to be paid
in his own.-G. M. (Vic.).
Do Our Railways Pay?
I say they do, though it is the fashion
to hold them up as horrible examples
of inefficiency and contrast them with the
railway systems of other lands. They
pay, and pay well, as railways go.
During 1932-33 Government railways’
net g arn j n g S on capital cost amounted to
. * mnsirWahlv higher
322 £ c -» ™ hlch 15 a considerably higher
rate than the average dividends paid to
English or American railway shareholders,
Queensland topped the list with 4.89
per cent. Victoria was second with 4.12
per cent., and others followed: W.A.
3.40 per cent., N.S.W. 3.01 per cent., S.A.
2.78 per cent, and Tas. 1.2 per cent. The
Federal railways showed a minus of 0.25
p er cent., which is nothing to be scared
about, seeing that it represents the capi-
tal cos t of the Trans, and the North-
South lines, both constructed for military
purposes, and rightly chargeable to De-
fence expenditure.
The trouble is that the whole of
those net earnings, and then some, have
lQ be paid out in interest on loans,
most of w fii c h were floated at rates con-
s j dera bly higher than 3.22 per cent,
Australian railways had been con-
structed and run by private companies
tb shareholders would not have received
]ike the return which the bond-
hofder^have received. They would have
g ot no thing in bad times, and to-day they
wou j d be getting something less than the
22 per cent, which represents the whole
f .£ n earni but even then they
d have had a much better invest .
the ■ sha reholders in most 0 f
the railway companies of the world.
But the people would have had a very
raw deal as compared tat which
ttic y have _ secured from Government rail-
wa Y s - dt is inconceivable that any cm-
pany would entertain the construction of
Trans, or the Noith-South, or even
lin e trom Sydney to Broken Hill.
The construction of railway lines further
than 100 miles from each of the capitals
would have been classed as uneconomic
investments. — Fed. L. (Vic.).


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The V.R.C. Benevolent Fund meeting is
usually held at Moonee Valley, but at the
week-end that course had been inundated
by storm water and the venue was
changed to Caulfield. Six inches of rain
had fallen between Thursday night and
Saturday morning, yet Caulfield is so
wonderfully recuperative that there was
not a wet spot to be seen, and really
fast times were recorded. Punters wished
that the meeting had been postponed,
for, although hot favorites rolled home
in the first two of nine races, a rot then
set in. The afternoon ended with
Sarokos (50 to 1) taking the second
division of the Highweight Handicap and
Galenos (20 to 1) annexing the Welter
Plate. Rain had commenced to fall
again, but McShortodds, from the shelter
of his expansive umbrella, ironically
shouted, “I’ll pay this outsider.”
Left in Melbourne by Lorigan, Ver-
berry was served up a warm favor-
ite for the middle-distance Fund Han-
dicap. His owner, Robinson, labelled
the Verbius colt a certainty, and, Skid-
more having been secured as jockey,
punters took 5 to 4. This made a
splendid market for other candidates,
and Cecil Godby seized the opportunity
to make a comparatively inexpensive
plunge on his Heroic gelding Excelic,
whose apprentice rider was able to claim
71b. Excelic set a fast pace, and Ver-
berry tired in the effort to overhaul him.
Limbohn, adroitly handled by Ashley
Reed, obtained the last run and defeated
Excelic by half a length. The winner, a

Limond gelding, was rushed across from
M.L. to run in the Melbourne Cup. He
has more than paid his way by winning
twice in Victoria.
Bnt'ebeard, the Heroic—Grey Tinge
colt for whom E. J. O’Dwyer gave
675gn5., on behalf of Clark and Robin-
son, made his debut in the Two-year-old
Handicap and ran third. The race was
won by Hall Mark’s sister Princess Cyn-
thia, who is leased from C. B. Kellow
by Gengoult Smith, recently Lord Mayor
of Melbourne. This filly easily accounted
for Tetbury, owned by H. N. Leonard,
When more seasoned Tetbury should be
heard of to some effect.
Sarokos and Galenos, whose successes
proved so expensive to punters, landed
their races from end to end. A hurdler,
Sarokos was regarded as out of his ele-
ment in the second division of the High-
weight Handicap, but the grey son of
Sarchedon showed a clean set of heels
to his rivals, and reached the judge two
lengths in advance of Prince Leo, who
carried a 51b. penalty for a victory at
Sunbury. The favorite, Silveroak, had
his chance ruined by a bump at the start,
Simmonds, the rider of Sarokos, was
blamed, and had the pleasure of riding
a winner diminished by being suspended
for a month.
Cox shared the fate of Simmonds in
being suspended for a month after pilot-
ing a winner. Cox annexed the second
division of the Two-year-old Handicap
on Wormana, a 5-to-4 favorite ; he was
adjudged guilty of crossing too sharply
in front of Whernside in the straight,
It is doubtful whether J. James, the
owner-trainer of Galenos, won anything
more than the stake. He holds Galenos
on lease from John Wren.
* * * *
Burlesque and Wexford gave great
promise when trained by Lawson at
Randwick. Both slipped afterwards ; now
each has returned to the winning list
about the same time —Burlesque at Caul-
field, Wexford at Moorefield. Wexford
had only Bst. in the Flying Handicap at
Moorefield, but on his form the last year
or so he deserved no more. There was
good money for him at threes ; he trailed
Questionnaire and Misnomer to the turn
for home, slipped past them—Knox rode
a clever race —and won easily from Val-
lage and Fleet. Ranchero’s fourth was
impressive. He, like Wexford, is down
in the weights.
An exciting finish in the Moorefield
Handicap saw the locally-trained Vol-
wood (8 to 1), who had scored at the
previous meeting on the Kogarah course,
beat Herolage by a head, with Ramrod
the same distance away and Counter-
part and Firecello at their girths. Vol-
wood got a nice run at the turn, but
Herolage and Ramrod had to fight their
way through a mass of beaten candi-
dates ; perhaps Herolage has returned
to his fine Queensland form. Prince
Pombal essayed to win all the way, but
he was beaten after he had gone a mile.
Back in the saddle after his suspen-
sion, Pike showed on Buonarroti (5 to 4)
in the Carlton Mile that he has lost none
of his skill. Slowing the field down after
hitting the front six furlongs from home,
William Kelso’s natty High Art gelding
was not off the bit from the turn.
Cynical’s rider erred in not making the
favorite carry his 9st. 31b. when ascend-
ing the hill. Wallace Kingsdale was a
bad third, and Kala Moti last. She was
well backed at sixes,
....
Manly sportsman A. J. H. Gray, who
races Imbiber on lease from A.J.C. com-
mitteeman Hunter White, won the
Juvenile with the neddy at 2to 1. Im-
biber exhibited pace and stamina when
Strathbogie, a nice Magpie colt, kept
him going for the first couple of fur-
longs. He is a brother to Loratip and a
half-brother, to Lorason.
......
Warwick Farm-trained Miss Whitty
had been racing so well that it was no
surprise when she was made favorite for
the Kogarah Stakes at' 5 to 2. However,
the daughter of Whittier was never going
smoothly, and it was obvious a long way
from home that she had no chance. The
hitherto disappointing Field Magnet
scored decisively, at 14 to 1, from
Mayonnaise and Spotlight. Field Mag-
net' is trained at Rosehill and was ridden
in good style by A. R. Phillips, who is
apprenticed to W. Ross,
......
Northern sportsman C. F. Evans has a
promising galloper in Quick Way, who
made an exhibition of his field in a
division of the Maiden Handicap. Start-
ing at 9 to 4 he quickly settled down in
the lead, to score by six lengths. He is a
smart-looking five-year-old chestnut by
Arachne’s sire Corban from Kanchani
. “Thormanby”: Australia is getting an
important addition to its thoroughbred
sires. Sol Green has bought, Lo Zingaro
from J. A. Dewar, and, though no figures
are given, English “Sporting Life” says
the price is the highest ever paid by an
Australian for an English horse. Lo
Zingaro ran third in this year’s St. Leger,
and won two of the three races he started
in as a two-year-old. He is by Solario
out of Love in Idleness. Solario brought
the then record price of 47,000 guineas
when Lord Glanely bought him for his
stud.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Ali Bey v. Clarke and Mamos v. Wong
Bock Cheung was the fine programme
put on at the Sydney Stadium on Thurs-
day (Bey and Mamos were the winners),
but it failed to attract. Twice as many
people went out to Leichhardt on Satur-
day to see Lurich and Penchiff in their
third contest in a couple of weeks ; a
draw. Apparently Sydney prefers the
same old performers doing the same old
stuff.
Ins and Outs
Nitschke (86) was again the best of the
South Aus. batsmen in the Shield match
against Queensland at Brisbane. Waite
(51), Badcock (35) and Whitington (44)
helped, but they were all out for 281.
Three of the early wickets went to Oxen-
ham, and he finished with 4-68 off 27
overs ; the S’African, Christy, took a fine
catch off his bowling. Wyeth, a left-
hander who played in two Shield games
last season without taking a wicket, got
the remaining 6 for 33 from 17 overs.
Hansen made an equally spectacular
showing with the bat. Going in fourth
wicket down, he contributed 147, made
in 187* minutes. Bensted (59) and Oxen-
ham (70) were the best of the others ;
Christy (31) was one of the opening bats-
men. The last wicket fell at 401 ; Grim-
mett 6 for 138. S. Aus. lost four good
wickets in wiping out the deficiency, and
on Monday afternoon it looked odds on
Queensland.
“Glenelg”: At the end of this season
Nitschke will hang up his bat. He is a
grazier, and finds it hard to spare the
time for big cricket or even for practice.
With a little encouragement he might
have turned out another Darling, but
encouragement he did not get. He was
picked in two matches against the South
Africans, but though he did well with
the bat was incontinently dropped. Prior
to this season he had played 44 Sheffield
innings for South Australia, with a high-
est score of 142 and an average of 38.
* * * *
“D. and O.”: No need for tears over
Ponsford’s decision to chuck big cricket
(B. 28/11/’34). He says himself that
he is not only sick of the strain of the
game, but disillusioned by the spirit of
bickering and intrigue which is a feature
of cricket in its more exalted plane. He
is married, and has given hostages to
fortune, and professional cricket doesn’t
tempt him. With Woodfull, O’Reilly
and Ponsford backing out of the game
to attend to the real business of life,
young Australia’s attitude towards lime-
light sport takes on a healthier aspect.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Sydney grade cricket re-
cently saw an unusual happening. Bor-
wick, one of the Test-match umpires, was
officiating in a match between Marrick-
ville and Western Suburbs when he no-
balled Burt, the W.S. skipper, for unfair
delivery. The novelty lay in the fact that
the ump. was standing at the batsman’s
end when he “called” the bowler at the
other. His action was perfectly legal,
but most uncommon.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: The Afrikanders have
fixed up the Australian tour of 1935-36
with five Tests. The first begins at
Durban on December 14, and the others
will be played at Jo’burg, Capetown,
Jo burg and Durban. The Australians
reach Durban on November 15, and
leave for home on March 5, 1936. There
will be 10 matches against the provinces,
including one against Rhodesia. This
time all the Tests will be played on
grass, the Wanderers’ ground at Johan-
nesburg having been put under turf. This
explains the cutting out of Kimberley
and Bloemfontein, which still affect the
dirt-matting pitch.
(Continued on page 36.)
Racquet and Bawl
Crawford has beaten Perry at last.
He accomplished the feat in the final of
the N.S.W. singles at Rushcutter Bay, and
it was no fluke. The Australian came to
the net more frequently than usual, and
his service was accurate and severe;
Perry for the most part stayed on the
baseline. Crawford took the first set at
7-5, Perry the second 6-2, Crawford the
third 6-3, Perry the fourth 6-1. The
Englishman was at 5-4 in the final set,
but Crawford came again, to win 7-5.
Then 6000 people emitted shouts and
screams of delight that might have been
heard at South Head.
In the final of the women’s singles
Dorothy Round gave Mrs. Westacott no
time to settle down. ■ The first set she
took at 6-2, the second without losing a
game. She seems in a class of her own.
Crawford and McGrath downed Hop-
man and Maier in the doubles, 6-1, 6-4,
6-4, and in the mixed doubles Perry and
Miss Round mastered Hopman and Mrs.
Hopman, 6-3, 6-4. In the women’s
doubles Misses Dearman and Lyle beat
Mrs. Hopman and Miss Round, 6-4, 6-0.
They, too, seem too good for our girls.
**. * *
Brugnon, on.his way to the Melbourne
tennis tourney in company with Boussus,
told an Auckland interviewer that the
next Davis Cup was a dead snip for Eng-
land if Austin and Perry remained ama-
teurs. He regards this as certain as far
as next season goes, for, apart from win-
ning the trophy, another victory would
immensely enhance their value should
they decide to accept the offers to turn
professional which have been showered
on them. Brugnon thinks America
should be a good second in spite of recent
defections to the paid ranks. He believes
the young “Californians,” Budge and
Mako, the latter a boy of the Nippon
breed but a 100 p.c. Amurrican citizen,
will make up for the loss of Lott and
Stoeffen.
* * * *
“Milton”: Queensland tennis —that is,
the grass-court section, which regards
itself as all that matters —is on the finan-
cial rocks. The State team recently in
Sydney had to pay its own expenses, the
State L.T.A. cupboard lacking even a
razoo. On the other hand, the hard-
courters, the proletariat of the game, arc
beastly affluent and pay the expenses of
their travelling teams by means of a
levy of 3d. a head on their thousands of
members. It is now suggested that the
Q.L.T.A. raise funds by an impost of
Is. a head, since the membership is
smaller than the H.C.A.’s. At present
its h.q. at' Milton is not fit for first-class
tennis, and tournaments and inter State
matches have to be run on catch-as-
cat'ch-can principles.
(Continued from page 36.)
“Hotham”: Australians watching the
centenary polo tourney in Melbourne
were staggered when the Maoriland team
turned out in blue shirts instead of the
All-Black and silver fern which the world
associates with the name of M.L. sport.
Even the M.L. bowlers are faithful to
the tradition. The visitors were defeated,
though they played good polo and were
better mounted than their predecessors
of a few years ago in the first tourney
for the Australian. Gold Cup in Sydney.

Can Winooka regain his 1933 form?
Randwick habitues doubted it when the
son of Windbag—Kanooka was put in
work again after his unfortunate visit to
the U.S.A.; but on Thursday he gal-
loped “four” in “50!,” beating a stable-
companion pointless, and his showing im-
pressed everyone who saw it. In autumn
of the year named Winooka won six
races (including the Futurity and the
Doncaster) in seven starts. There are
so few first-class horses about and there
is such a tremendous gap between the
best and the second-best that if he stands
the long preparation that Poison is neces-
sarily giving him he is quite capable of
doing something like it again. After all,
he hasn’t had a great deal of racing,
and he is the same age as Chatham, who
has raced so notably this season.
* * * *
“Flattite”: The disposal of the Bonny-
vale (Vic.) stud reawakens memories of
the James Wilsons, father and son, \vho
were associated with it for so many
years. From Bonnyvale came many fine
horses ; among them Musidora, Briseis,
Miss Jessie, Ringmaster, Lonsdale, First
King, Newhaven, Merriwee, Palmer, Dif-
fidence, Scotland, Philio, Nitre, Danaus,
Nautical and Sir Andrew. They were
not all bred there, but a good many
were, Newhaven and other great horses
descending from Musidora.
* * * *
Gordon Richards rode 212 winners
during the English racing season, which
closes much later than ours, and headed
the list again. In 1933, when he topped
Fred Archer’s record of 246 winning
mounts, he weighed in first 259 times.
The leading Victorian jockey last
season was Skidmore, with 52 outright
winners and a dead-heater ; the leading
N.S.W. lad was O’Sullivan, 68 firsts and
two dead-heats. Of course, Richards rode
in many more races than either, and, to
a large extent, he can pick and choose.
An old Maoriland horse called Prince
Paladin was bought for Perth two or
three seasons ago and did pretty well
there. Taken to Adelaide he lost all
form. He recovered it surprisingly at
the Port Adelaide R.C.’s last meeting,
and his few backers received £33 6s. for
£1 tickets on a tote which paid three
dividends; £3 15s. for 2s. on the flat.
The race was the Municipal Han-
dicap ; there was a ss. doubles tote
on the Handicap and the Welter, first
and second in which were Ambah (6 to
1) and Fur Seal (4 to 1). The dividend on
the Prince Paladin-Ambah combination
was £289 Bs.; on Prince Paladin-Fur Seal,
£lB Is. 9d. The doubles bookmaker will
be a gone coon at Randwick and Flem-
ington from the moment he has to com-
pete with the doubles tote, and the
sooner it is introduced on both courses
the better punters will be pleased.
Ins and Outs
The Sydney match between N.S.W.
and South Aus. (beaten by an innings
and 158) was a horrid flop financially,
only 13,000 attending to see the funeral.
The Sheffield season generally promises
to be a dull one. The public is fed up
after the tour of England, and the ab-
sence of Bradman, Woodfull and O’Reilly
will make a big difference in the draw-
ing power of some of the teams. Also
the selection of the side for South Africa
is too far off to arouse much interest.
* * * *
“Sept.”: I wasn’t astonished at the
disgraceful showing of the Adelaide
cricketers in Sydney. What else could
you expect of a set of lads who rot their
insides with temperance drinks? In the
great days of South Australian cricket
we drank beer, and out of a pewter.
Beer for lunch, beer for dinner, beer
(with prawns) for supper; and what
cricketers we were! Modesty obliges
me to omit my own name, but
no State, county or country has been
represented by more interesting cricketers
or finer fellows than Jack Lyons,
George Giffen, Joe Darling, Affy Jar-
vis and his brother Fred, Ernie Jones,
Clem Hill and Jack Reedman, and no
bowler that ever lived could go through
that side on a plumb wicket. They
always gave the crowd its money’s worth.
Played the game as if they loved it, sir ;
and they did love it —and liked their beer.
Away with these anremic teetotallers!
Let the selectors go looking for lads
who don’t turn pale at the sight of a pot,
and bring to light another Lyons, another
“Jonah,” another Giffen. The glory of
S.A. cricket has been extinguished since
it faltered in its devotion to beer.
* * * *
“Five Ways”: The player-writer busi-
ness has been causing a lot of barge in
Brisbane. Bowler Thurlow has been told
that he must give up his pen work or
inter-State cricket. At' the last inter-
state conference, the Queenslanders tried
to have even professional journalists who
were cricketers fenced off from the foun-
tain-pen, but the motion flopped. There
is another hurdle facing the Q.C.A. in
the case of South African Christy. Part
of his income as a coach is to be made
up by a newspaper which expects articles
in return.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: I note “Kerloof” ap-
proves of the alteration to the l.b.w. rule
“What do you mean by saying Hori
is good with the ball?”
“I didn’t —I said he’s a better bowler than batsman.”
which permits a batsman to be given
out to a ball breaking from the off (B.
28/11/’34). The fool-idea hands the off-
spinner wickets on a lordly dish while
the left-handers and other bowlers break-
ing from the leg continue without relief
from the batsman who prefers using his
pads to his bat. But it will be only
the craze of a season. I can recall a trial
of the same rule in 1910 in the second-
class county fixtures. The thing died in
a season, universally execrated by play-
ers and harassed umpires alike.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Melb.”: A major secret of the Ameri-
cans’ superiority was evidenced again in
the four-ball, best-ball event at Vic-
toria Club. These smiling, inscrutable
automatons never know when they’re
licked. Rufus Stewart, the stout S. Aus.
veteran, and Kelly, of N. S. Wales, actu-
ally went to lunch 2 up on the centenary
championship finalists, Diegel and Shute,
in a variant on gowf which was quite
strange to them. Then Shute pulled his
socks up, and the visitors won 3 up at
the 34th. The only Australians to regis-
ter a win on the day were the youthful
Victorians Martin Smith and Naismith.
Their best ball for the first 18 was 66,
and they were 5 up on Laffoon and
Craig Wood at the 28th in the afternoon.
Even so the Americans fought on to the
35th.
“Galleryite”: Australia’s licking in the
singles sounds awful whether you say
that the cream of our club-swingers were
beaten by six matches to nil or by 32
holes to 24 —a collection 8 down. And
it doesn’t sound worse than it looked.
None of our lads gave the Yanks a
serious game except Martin Smith, who
only fell 2 and 1 to Laffoon. Every
sportsman in Melbourne —and that in-
cludes every member of the U.S.A. team
—has been speculating as to why Aus-
tralians, whose finished technique in box-
ing, tennis, football, boat-sailing, swim-
ming, billiards and other forms of sport
has aroused admiration all over the
world, should shape so crudely at golf.
It isn’t as if the game hadn’t caught on
here. In some universities and schools
golf is beginning to rival football in
popularity.
* * *!• * *
“Cleek”: .Sydney is to have another
glimpse of the American golfers in
action. They have agreed to put off
their departure for home via Maoriland
and play another match at the Lakes
course. December 7 and 8 will be the
deciding days, and at time of writing a
mixed team of amateurs and profes-
sionals is proposed as opposition.
* * * *
“Brassey”: If anyone, six months ago,
had placed Jim Ferrier fourth on the
list of Australian amateur golfers, the
Sydney golf experts would have de-
manded his head on a flag pin. Gene
Sarazen, who should know, has put him
there, with McKay, Mick Ryan and Wil-
liams ahead of him. The reason for Fer-
rier’s falling-off (B. 28 /11 / ’34) is that he
has foolishly been listening to expert ad-
vice on how to correct alleged faults in
his swing, and so on. The result is that
he is now in two minds about every
shot he plays, and in golf that is what
Sherman said war was. He has a fine

“Quark”: Those Blue Mountain crows
(B. 21/11/’34) will have to look to their
laurels. Following on their campaign
against golf balls during the women's
tourney, a pet emu appeared on the
Mona Vale golf links and in two days
made off with 18 pills. There was no
chance of recovery as with the crows,
which occasionally drop their prey, for
the brute swallowed his catch instanter.
He took up a possie just about a fail-
drive up the seventh fairway. When
pursued the fowl just ambled amiably
out of reach.

“Hoylake”: Tell “Pom” Joyce
Wethered has been a professional for
two years past (B. 21/11/ ’34), her accept-
ance of a job as golf demonstrator at
Harrod’s having put her on the outer.
It would have been quite in order, then,
if she had consented to tour Australia
with the Kirkwood circus. No one in
Australia among the associates could
have given the lady a gallop. She is
still, as Bobby Jones said of her, able to
hold her own with the very cream of the
male players. Recently in England some-
one fixed up a match between Joyce and
Enid Wilson, unconquered champion of
Britain for several successive seasons.
Though a stranger to competitive golf
for some time, Joyce beat Enid 2 up.
Racquet and Bawl
Apart from Perry, the overseas men at
Rushcutter Bay shaped disappointingly in
singles. In a five-set match Hughes was
downed by Thompson in the second
round ; in the next round Thompson was
beaten by Crawford in straight sets. The
second round also saw Maier’s finish.
Gar Moon got his scalp in straight sets.
Menzel and Kirby went in the third
round; Menzel down to Hopman and
Kirby to Quist. Neither semi-final
was interesting. Quist never had a
chance against Perry, and didn’t attempt
much. Against Hopman Crawford won
the first set 8-6, and dropped the next
without winning a game. He brightened
afterwards, to take the match in the
fourth set.
Two English girls reached the semi-
finals of the women’s singles, Dorothy
Round dropping only nine games. Miss
Dearman went under 12-10, 6-3 to Mrs.
Westacott in the third round, and the
hard-hitting Queenslander overwhelmed
Miss Hartigan 7-5, 6-4. Miss Round had
an easy win over Miss Lyle, 7-5, 6-3.

Stanley Youdale, manager of the last
unfortunate Davis Cup team, has re-
turned full of indignation against Hop-
man, who accompanied the party with
a newspaper commission, because of
what that young man wrote about Mc-
Grath. “Hopman,” he says, “is a much
better player than writer.” But aren’t
they all?

authorities have so little use for lawn
tennis. “Maier,” it seems, was “dis-
turbed by the applause of spectators
watching a game on a neighboring
court.” The same gentleman was so put
out by “the calling and movement of ice-
cream vendors” that “he appealed to the
central umpire to stop it.” “Annoyance
was shown by Quist when he was foot-
faulted.” A girl’s laughter put Menzel
off his game ; “the umpire’s decision was
beyond dispute, but Menzel remained
unconvinced” ; when told that his mixed-
doubles match could not be postponed,
“Menzel said he would withdraw from
all events and catch the next boat home.”
As for another interesting martyr, “the
muscles in the ball of his right thumb
cramped, and he dropped his racquet in
pain.” This tragedy, I infer, was preci-
pitated by “a bad blister between the
thumb and the first finger.” Then, of
course, there is the unhappy affair of
Harry and Viv—“Hopman’s criticism of
McGrath worried the life out of him.”
What a time a footballer would get if
he performed in any of these ways!
Girl players are not nearly such sensi-
tive plants as the lads. There is a White
City tradition of a young woman who,
in the bitterness of defeat, threw herself
down and bit a piece out of Mother
Earth ; but I don’t credit it. From what
I have seen of them, the ladies recog-
nise tennis for what it is, a jolly good
social game, and take defeat and vic-
tory in good part. Miss Round looks very
serious, but others contrive to smile
much of the time. Mrs. Westacott
smiles nearly all the time.
Miscellaneous
“Tenakoe”: If a violent upheaval is
reported from M.L. shortly don’t hastily
diagnose it as an earthquake. It
will be the All-Black R.U. perusing a
letter from the British International
Board asking it to see that none of
its forwards for the 1935-36 tour of
Britain exceeds 14st. 71b. The letter also
suggests that if any young man in the
U.K. sides is injured the visitors should j
play light, in view of the fact that they
are matured men, while many British
players are often mere youths still at the
universities! The request sounds almost i
incredible, but the matter has been pub-
lished and discussed in the British press.
If persisted in, it is likely to raise a fuss
beside which bodyline bowling will pale
into insignificance.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Though America has de-
clined to send a team, the Melbourne
centenary athletic meeting in January
will be the biggest show of its kind this
country has seen. Maoriland is sending
over half a dozen men and England four.
It was hoped that the M.L. world’s mile
champion Lovelock could have come
along with the Britons, but exams, have
pulled him up. Finland is to forward a
high-jumper and a javelin-thrower. All
these will subsequently show in Syd-
ney, and the season will wind up with
a de luxe match between N.S.W. and
Victoria in Melbourne on February 2.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Sydney is making a
bold bid to get the Empire Games of
1938. A postal vote of the States is to
be taken, and the answer is sure to be
in the affirmative. The hurdle is the
raising of the £lO,OOO guarantee which the
entertaining country has to put up. Of
course, someone has already suggested
biting the Government ear. Games in
Canada and England have proved a
financial success, and if Hamilton
(Canada), with a population of only a
tenth of Sydney’s, can make such a show
pay, there should be no trouble in that
regard at this end. There is plenty of
time to raise the guarantee with proper
organisation, and 1938 will be Sydney’s
150th anniversary, when other festivities
will draw big crowds to the Bridge City.

Goods in Shop Windows
From time to time The Bulletin’s Ser-
vice Department is asked to settle an
argument arising over some shopper’s
disgust at having been refused goods in
a shop window at their displayed price.
The query usually raises the point of
whether the shopkeeper can legally de-
cline to hand over the goods in return for
the stated sum.
Around this vexed question revolve
some of the basic principles of the Eng-
lish law of contract. A man who goes to
town every day enters into dozens of
contracts —when he buys his newspaper,
pays his fare on the train, tram or ferry,
orders a suit, buys shares in a company,
sits in a bootblack’s chair, or gets into a
taxi and gives the driver instructions to
drive him somewhere.
All these transactions are governed by
the law of contract. “A contract is an
agreement intended to have legal conse-
quences, and to be legally enforceable.”
And all contracts are governed by rules
relating to offer and acceptance. There
must be mutual assent as to the terms,
and there must be no confusion as to
the identity of the goods or the nature of
the services to be rendered.
Returning to the specific case of goods
displayed for sale in a shop the crux
of the position is whether the window
display represents an offer or merely an
invitation to do business. Stevens’s Mer-
cantile Law says:
A may offer B a book for sale at a
certain price, and B may say, “I will take
it at your price,” or A may expose it for
sale on a bookstall, and B may, with
A’s assent, take it up and remove it, saying
nothing about price.
in the second case A’s assent is needed,
and that' seems to be the rule governing
all this type of transactions. To quote
Stevens again:
It is not always the party who makes
the first overture who is the proposer. For
instance, a tradesman advertises that he has
a cheap lot of goods for sale; he is not
the proposer making an offer fpr a con-
tract of sale, he is but holding himself put
as ready to consider offers made to him.
Anson, the recognised authority on
contract law, says:
In all these cases the same question pre-
sents itself under various forms. Is there
an offer? And, to constitute an offer, the
words used, however general, must be cap-
able of application to specific persons, and
must be distinguishable from mere state-
ments of intention, from invitations to
transact business, and from advertisements
or puffery which does not contemplate legal
relations.
It seems, therefore, that goods dis-
played in a shop window with just a
price-label attached, and no other offer
to sell, are merely an invitation to the
public to come into the shop and make
an offer for them at that price. The
identity of the would-be contractee only
thus becomes ascertainable. Whether
the offer is to be accepted or not rests
with the shopkeeper.
Settled Out of Court
“El V.”: Lean times are coming for
commercial lawyers if the plans of
British and Australian Chambers of Com-
merce come to fruition.
The Federated Chambers of the British
Empire have adopted comprehensive
rules for settling disputes by arbitration
instead of in court, and the Associated
Chambers in Australia are working to
see them implemented with the aid of
affiliated bodies.
The idea is that each State chamber
should set up a roster of competent arbi-
trators from among whom disputants
could draw their own panel. Under the
scheme it is suggested that all contracts
include a clause which would automati-
cally bring any dispute within the juris-
diction of the arbitration system and
make it subject to chamber rules, though
agreements without the clause could also
be dealt with by consent of th'e parties.
The plan is bound to lead to a simplifi-
cation of commercial law. It might be
a good thing, indeed, if it were given
statutory sanction so that the decisions
of arbitrators might be registered with
the consent of the parties and have the
full force of law.
The Fruit’s All Right
“C.P.”: It came to us over the radio
the other night, on the authority of the
customary Australian professor travel-
ling abroad, that British Columbia
orchardists are paying such attention to
grading and packing of fruit that if our
“I hear ’ee be goin’ to city, Tummas?”
“Aye, Richard. Young Treliving do say gold-diggers be makin’ heaps o’ money
deown there.”
orchardists don’t improve their methods
they will lose what little grip they have
on the London market.
I live in a Vic. irrigation district. In
the last three years I’ve seen thousands
of cases of apples, pears and plums
graded, packed, labelled and shipped in
such a condition that they were a tribute
to growers, packers and Government in-
spectors —the last so strict that even after
fruit has been passed at the packing-shed
it is sometimes sent back (whole truck-
loads) from the ship’s side because of a
few blemishes discovered there. What
more Australian orchardists and officials
can do—even Canadian softwood cases
are used —passes all understanding.
At Melbourne’s Royal Show there was
an interesting exhibit featuring the
canned fruit, vegetables, jams and meat
exported from Australia compared with
those exported by other countries. In
almose every case the Australian get-up
and labelling far surpassed those of our
overseas rivals. Then why don t we get
the monetary returns commensurate with
our efforts? Orchardists put it down to
the system of selling through London
brokers. If they are right, a change will
have to be made there. Meanwhile, pro-
fessors would do better for their students
and for Australia if they examined the
methods of Australian producers before
backhandedly decrying them to the world.
“Dry Ice”
“E.H.M.”: One modern invention in
which Australia lags behind is “dry ice”
—a by-product of power-alcohol manu-
facture. So universal is the application
of it in other countries that patents have
been sold for £4,500,000. “Dry ice” is
used on a tremendous scale in the U.S.A.
It is produced at a temperature so
intense that it lasts longer than ordinary
ice and can be transported great dis-
tances in the open air. Commercially
it is used to preserve products already
packed—a method impossible with ordi-
nary refrigeration —and it is said to
“hold” flavors. Fruits and vegetables are
already being kept in Europe from sea-
son to season by use of the process, and
a project is on foot in London to im-
port fruit-juices in block form.
Exporting agencies certainly should
investigate the new technique.
Maoriland has just been visited by 750
Australian tourists per the Strathaird.
Of that lot 235 did the one-day trip to
Rotorua at £2 17s. a head, and roughly
200 travelled overland from Auckland
to Wellington at an average transport and
accommodation cost of £9 each. There
was nearly £2500 for Maoriland railways,
hotel proprietors and motor-service
owners on that score alone, and hundreds
of people visited theatres and bought
souvenirs and clothes. Organisation was
excellent. The jaunt to Rotorua, for in-
stance, was scheduled to start from Auck-
land station at 7.45 a.m. and to return at
10.7 p.m.; that timetable was observed
to the tick, and the liner was on its way
to Wellington punctually at midnight.
The N. S. Wales Government Tourist
Bureau’s two-day tour to Jenolan Caves
at £2 9s. 7d. a head appeared to the Aus-
tralian traveller to show more service for
the money. On the other hand, the
Maoriland Bureau obviously laid itself
out to do business, and stretched a point
here and there where necessary. Austra-
lian tourist and publicity officers might
do well to take an educational jaunt on
one of the three other cruises that leave
Australia for M.L. within the next month
or so.
* * * *
Largely because of Lang’s attempted
capital levy on mortgages, and of his
moratorium and landlord-and-tenant
legislation, which has been continued
with little alteration by Stevens, the
building trades have suffered more in
Sydney than in any other capital. Hotels
are bringing them some much-needed
business. Extensive alterations at the
Manly and the Sydney are to be fol-
lowed by a £lOO,OOO addition to the Aus-
tralia, extending to Martin-place. And
no doubt portion of the £lOO,OOO being
asked for by the Carlton board will be
required for improvements.
* H> * ; i ;
“De Aar”: Evidence was given to the
Tariff Board in Melbourne last week
that standard Australian spark-plugs
were sold here retail at 4s. 6d. Austra-
lian, while in the U.K. the retail selling
price was ss. sterling. These British plugs
sold in Australia for ss. 6d., despite the
fact that exchange and duties brought up
the price to 6s. 3d. It was thus claimed
that, owing to the imposition of the
duties, the purchaser made a saving of
Is. 9d. on every purchase of an Austra-
lian plug and of ninepence on every pur-
chase of an imported plug. In spite of
the cheapness and apparent quality of
the Australian products, imports had far
outstripped local production. Perhaps
the most serious fact elicited was that
Japan was retailing plugs for 25., though
as yet only a small number had come
into the country.
* * * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: A cargo of 8500
tons of Queensland sugar, consigned to
Canada, went to sweeten the seas when
the Clan liner Clan Mackay struck a reef
off Sierra Leone. Canada is buying
Queensland sugar heavily, and even if
she doesn’t replace this lost 8500 tons her
purchase this season will still be 8000
tons above her last year’s import.
* * * *
“G.M.”: Mention of the Aussie who
has put passion-fruit juice on the British
market suggests the wide opening there
is for a similar effort' in the U.S.A.
American visitors to Australia wax en-
thusiastic over the flavor. Fear of the
fruit-fly makes the U.S.A. prohibit all
fruit —even seeds. Pacific liners have to
jettison every vestige before they
approach American shores. Still, the
pulp could be sent in bottles, and should
command good prices for flavoring.
H= * * *
“A.A.”: A new industry at last! Un-
less something goes wrong with the
plans the black metallic sands of the
northern N. S. Wales and southern
Queensland coastal beaches are to be
worked for rutile, or titanium oxide, a
basis of white paint—hy a Canadian co.
at Burleigh (Q.) and by a Melbourne con-
cern at Coff’s Harbor (N.S.W.). If
separation of the rutile is economically
successful, one may look for an appre-
ciable addition to the national wealth,
for rutile is in great demand, and there
is any quantity of these black sands.
They also contain gold, platinum and
osmiridium in minute particles.

“Adelaide”: The Commercial Travel-
lers’ Association of S.A. has celebrated
its 60th year of existence. At the inevit-
able dinner president Berry claimed that
it was the first of its kind in Australia,
and handed to three members the certi-
ficate of 50 years’ service.

“Aero”: Hats off to T. R. Young, who
has achieved new flying honors for Aus-
tralia—3ooo hours carrying passengers in
the New England Co.’s City of Sydney,
between the Harbor City and Brisbane,
a world’s record for a single pilot
with a single ’plane. He has never had
an accident in 5780 hours of passenger
flying in the last seven years, and he is
Queensland-born and entirely Australian-
trained. He has been late on his run only
five times, on each occasion through bad
weather, and some of his taxi feats in
between times are classic. Starting the
day once at Bollon (s.-w. Q.) he dropped
a passenger at Morven, landed at Black-
all, Winton and Julia Creek, and finished
up 950 miles from his start at Cloncurry.
Young as the New England Airways is,
it has a second pilot who has flown 5000
hours with passengers—Keith Virtue.
Altogether the co. has a million miles of
commercial aviation to its credit, much
of it blind in duststorms and rain, but
no accident so far mars its record.

“Tripod”: Here’s more about that
stretch of comic-opera railway between
Cooktown and Laura (B. 21/11/ ’34).
Before _ the advent of the rail-motor, a
notice in the Cooktown station read:
Train departs from Laura about 10 a.m.
on the first of each month and returns
next day. Should the first fall on a
Sunday, train will leave next day and
return on Tuesday.
The Cooktown stationmaster was also
s.m. at the other end and for all inter-
mediate stations, and during the trip he
functioned as guard. The signals along
the line suffered the fate of most things
in this land of cyclones, and were blown
down early in history. The engine was
a wood-burner, and a condition of the
monthly service was that settlers should
have a good supply cut and piled handy
to the rails. Local humor had it that the
loco, knew every woodheap as a good
horse knows his pubs.

“Nindherry”: If the Duke of Glou-
cester likes the surf, I can show him the
way while he is at Buderim (Q.). Down
thfr track a mile or so to the left to where
he sees the broad bosom of the
Maroochy shining ; take a flattie in the
busy little township that has grown up
there in post-war years; five minutes
on smooth water; then miles of the
smoothest and safest beach in the world.
Neither Sydney nor Waikiki has any-
thing like it to show, and in any other
country it would long ago have been
connected by road to the capital and
made the rendezvous of every tourist
who came to the State. When I first
camped there 25 years ago there was no
township, but Tom O’Connor has made
one —Tom, the sturdy surveyor whose
father was born on St. Helena four years
after Napoleon died there, often as a
boy walked with Bertrand down Jacob’s
ladder, saw the Emperor’s body removed
from exile in 1840, and lived to jubi-
late over the end of the Great War.
Maroochydore developed, Tom is build-
ing up another township a few miles away
at Alexandra Headland.
* * * *
“Vic”: What about letting some of
these city unemployed come up to the
Gulf country and do a bit of road-build-
ing for us here? A track from Brisbane
to Cairns and thence across the Atherton
to the Gilbert and into the Territory by
the Headingly would be one of the
finest tourist routes in the world. Scenery,
fishing, shooting, mobs of cattle, blacics
(wild, but not too wild), goldmining towns,
sugar farms, dairy farms, cattle farms,
goat farms, mounted) police all abound
on the track. In fact, everything is in
plenty except the politician. And the
fact that we have only about one of
them to every hundred thousand square
miles or so should be an added attraction.

“A.H.”: E. P. Dowley, who died at
Fremantle the other day at 80, was
almost the last of the old-time goldfields
wardens who saw Westralian history
made in the roaring ’nineties. They
were petty autocrats in their respective
districts ; hardly one of them had any
legal training, and they were often pic-
tured as gruff and dictatorial, but held
the scales of justice fairly. Dowley was
Irish, a Trinity College, Dublin man and
a civil engineer, who spent his first six
“Would you kindly lake your hat off?”
years in Westralia in a Government job
in his own profession. Forrest made
him a goldfields warden in 1892; he
put in seven years in that capacity at
Cue and eight or nine at Coolgardie and
Kalgoorlie. He finished up as R.M. at
Fremantle, being retired, at the age limit,
14 years ago.

“Kaloa”: Thrilling extract from a
Yankee adventure ' story about Cape
York:
It was dangerous country. Meadows
would not let them leave the camp with-
out their rifles. “And mind,” he said, “to
cut the tops off your bullets. These
buffalo take stopping” The fires on the
horizon told of haunting tribes.
My oath those buffalo take stopping!-
But you should have seen me a few years
ago rolling down Michigan-avenue, Chi.,
under Hotchkiss escort, with a wary eye
out for Sioux and bison.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
The only archway erected -in the city in
honor of the Duke of Gloucester is at the
main entrance. to Parliament House, where he
is lodging. Lines of streamers and flags made
the streets gay for him, and, white flagpoles
with gilded tops thrust themselves from all the
Government buildings and the City Hall, with
a myriad flags swaying from them.
New parquetry floors were laid down in the
Duke’s suite at Parliament House of some
of our finest Queensland woods. They are
impressive, but have disadvantages. Several
unofficial souls, entering or leaving the rooms,
have already measured their length on them.
Both the furniture in the lounge and the
main pieces in the bedroom are Queensland
maple. Chippendale, adapted to the needs of
the Queensland climate, gave the inspiration
for the bedroom, and one or two pieces,
notably the footstool and the lamp standard,
are pure Chippendale. The lamp standard
and the chandelier are carved of imported
beech. That humble wood, mostly found in a
carpenter’s plane, is treated on the Continent
with some mysterious process while it is grow-
ing, and comes to the craftsmen’s hands look-
ing like old ivory, with here and there the
merest whisper of a color—palest pinks and
greens. No machinery has touched the wood
used in the bedroom furniture, save for rough
shaping and polishing. All the delicate carved
designs are the handwork of Queensland crafts-
men.
The Murphys, of Buderim, where the Duke
will spend his second week-end in Queensland,
have vacated their house, and have gone to
their seaside cottage at Mooloolabah. It’s a
rare woman who can forego the privilege of
entertaining royalty.
The Brisbane official programme for Tues-
day was heavy. The royal train was at Cen-
tral station at 2.30 p.m., and for some un-
godly reason pulled in at No. 4 platform, so
that the Duke might have a good view of
ugly old buildings before making a round-
about way to the Shrine of Remembrance,
where he placed a wreath. Twenty-one guns
were fired by the Australian Field Artillery
and the 9th-49th Battalion had the * honor of
furnishing the guard of honor. The 2nd-14th
Australian Light Horse provided the military
escort for the procession. The usual shoal of
addresses descended on the visitor before he
dined—dinner was a private affair—and the
Government reception took place at nine o’clock
the same night.
The general public is disappointed that the
Duke will not attend a race meeting in Bris-
bane, for hundreds of loyal subjects who will
see no more than the tip of his Hussar plume
during the progresses and who are not suffici-
ently m the social swim to have invitations to
functions would have had a chance to see him
at Ascot.
To fill the aching void between the departure
of the Grenadier Guards Band and the arrival
of the Duke, the Italian cruiser Armando Diaz
arrived like a heavenly messenger. Commen-
datore Vitali and his wife came from Sydney
while the boat was here, and Tom McWilliam,
Italian Consular Agent in Brisbane, and his
daughter, Mrs. R. H. Brown (she was one of
the Prince of Wales’s dancing partners in her
deb. year), also have been entertaining Cap-
tain laehino and his officers. Seventeen hosts,
by Commendatore Vitali and Mr. Mc-
Wilham, gave a dance at Lennon’s Hotel for
the officers, and Archbishop Duhig staged a
cheerful garden-party in their honor in the
grounds of Wynberg. There also was a civic
reception.
The ship s band and a party of 50 men
marched through the streets, led by the captain,
r> ace d a wreath at the foot of the Flame
?i Remembrance. The cruiser was open for
inspection “by Italian residents only,” but
quite a number of resourceful young Aus-
tralians got on board, and the sailors at the
gangway were too polite to argue with them.
One bright lad who found himself suspect
swore that his name was Michael Angelo,
and escaped up the gangway before the stag-
gered sentry could send for someone to eject
him.
Ella and Pat O’Shea, home again after their
wanderings through America, Europe and Eng-
land, were at a Toscanini recital in Salzburg
a tew days before the latest royal engagement
was announced. Prince George and Princess
Marina sat in the row behind them. Both
devoted supporters of the theatre, the O’Sheas
crammed no fewer than 18 plays into the month
they spent in London. Grace Palotta, an old
lnend, was their guest for the Continental
tour.
Caskets of Queensland wood—maple, walnut
and cedar —have been made for the wool-
iilled quilts which the Duke of Gloucester will
1 v" e back to the little Princesses Elizabeth and
Margaret Rose. Mrs. J. W. Greene and Mrs.
H. Mathams did the filling, and Mrs. C.
Keydon made the handwoven covers, which are
very lovely.
Wheat and field flowers will be some of the
decorations at the Combined Charities’ Ball
at the City Hall. Mrs. A. A. Fullarton is in
charge of the committee, and Mrs. A. Carmody
is to make the bouquets for presentation to the
very special ladies attending. Twenty-one debs,
now are listed, and between the first and
second suppers a balloon dance will be held.
Rev. A. C. Flint, travelling secretary of the
Australian Board of Missions, organised a very
interesting exhibition of mission curios at St.
Bartholomew’s Hall, Paddington. Primitive
stone and pearlshell implements from Bentinck
Island, priceless Chinese embroideries and
Indian brasses stood side by side.
Tl , le thirteenth annual report of the Bush
Book Club shows that 2200 readers from Cape
York to the N.S.W. border benefited. When
the club first started there were 17 readers,
so that the achievement for 13 years is no
mean one. Mrs. Ormond Smith is the presi-
dent, and Mrs. Firmin McKinnon, a leading
spirit ever since the club began, the hon. secre-
tary.
The visit of Sir Fabian Ware, permanent
vice-chairman of the War Graves Commis-
sioll’ enoe( f for many women the nightmares
lhat. have afflicted them for the last 20 years.
The Turks are lovely people,” he said em-
phatically ; and gave the lie direct to those
sensation-mongers who have propagated awful
stories of atrocities committed on prisoners of
war by Abdul. The war cemeteries are peace-
ful spots, and the green lawns and giant ro'se-
maiy bushes on Gallipoli, and the little gera-
niums bravely fighting for existence in almost
, rainless Mesopotamia, as shown in his pic-
tuies, prove finally that our dead are not
forgotten. A roving race,this Australian people.
Forty-five countries contain war cemeteries,
and not one of them but can show visitors
the names of Australians.
Joan, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. W. N.
Robertson, is the newest recruit to the ranks
of engaged young ladies. The lad is E. H.
(ioby) Roe, youngest son of Reggie Roe, who
was headmaster of the B.G.S. for so long.
Joan will live at Texas, where her fiance and
her brother Kenneth have a property together.
Toby, having failed to get himself accepted in
Australia in the first month of the war, saw
most of it through in the Royal Horse Artil-
lery.
December 21 will see the wedding of Grace
Henderson, daughter of Rev. Mervyn and Mrs.
Henderson. Papa is principal of Emmanuel
College. Gilbert Lead is the lucky man. The
bridesmaids will be Mollie McKenzie and Mar-
jorie Lead. St. Andrew’s, Creek-street, will
hear the Voice.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
“Come, haste to the wedding,” carolled
Sydney last Thursday, and not only
Sydney but the whole oi' Australia.
When the day’s round was ended and
the dinner dishes washed, every woman
either called on the neighbors or called
in the neighbors and sat around the
radio. If the lids had been taken off all
the homes, rich and poor, the stars would
have blinked down on the same sort of
groups; women young and old, each
feeling herself a guest at the wedding of
the Prince and his Princess.
London calling. Eleven o’clock booms
Big Ben. Out clash the Abbey bells.
Twelve thousand miles away from
Australia street lights prick the haze of
a still November day, the Houses of
Parliament, usually 30 proud, smile in a
debonair fashion at the Thames running
like molten pewter under Westminster
Bridge. Along the Mall roll glass coaches
bearing Kings and Queens, the bride-
groom, the bride, the white of her Lyons
silk dress richly brocaded in the silver
rose of England. Tall guards are every-
where, scarlet coat, gold lace and floating
plume. Through the handsome west
doorway of the Abbey shimmers the
silver bride, her every movement fol-
lowed breathlessly by a long distance
audience hundreds of thousands strong.
Her contralto voice repeats the vows
after the Archbishop of Canterbury in
full rich tones, and makes music of the
“obey,” which remains in the Anglican
marriage liturgy.
Never has wedding, even a royal wed-
ding, created such a tidal wave of
interest. Sentiment has welled over ; and,
whether it be the march of democracy or
what, never has the public been taken
so much into the confidence of Palace
circles as to the progress of a romance.
Lovely Marina has hardly bought a hat
or a hanky for her glory-box without the
world hearing of it, and every movement
of the handsome George has been
chronicled.
A swagman sat on a log playing a con-
certina while his billy boiled. In the
opposite corner woolly sheep huddled in
a pen near to a woolshed. There was a
bush pub where drinks could be had.
Over all rose tall and shady gum-trees.
The vestibule of the Town Hall seemed
staggered by its disguise as a bit of the
Never Never, but all-comers to the Coun-
try Women’s Association Ball smiled at
these old friends, and thought pleasantly
how the Duke would enjoy the outback
atmosphere. In the ballroom every pillar
was a bushland tree, and the backcloth
to the dais was a replica of old Govern-
ment House, Parramatta.
Debs, grimly grasping bouquets
popped out of every nook and cranny.
In all, there were 59 of them, and they
had been rehearsed nearly stiff for their
long, long trail up to the dais. Directly
the Duke, who squired Mrs. Matt
Sawyer, had settled down after his entry,
which was surrounded by vice-regals,
Lord Mayors, Chief Justices and a dazz-
lingly arrayed company of C.W.A. com-
mitteewomen, the presentations were
made, Commander Gifford and Captain
Royce Shannon being Lord High An-
nouncers. Scouts gripped taut the ropes
that marked the laneway of red carpet,
and from the far end of the room stepped
the first of the seemingly endless line of
girls, all in white but one in faintest rose
and one in green, the lace frocks the
most charming.
Anne Gordon, in green, had her first
dance with the Duke. Anne has a sort
of woodland look about the eyes that
seems to go with green lace. Her pals
of the evening were Barbara Warry, in
black with plaid servings, and Philip
Game. Mrs. John Ritchie, of Melbourne,
who was another of H.R.H.’s partners,
looked stunning in black. Lady Game,
who again trod a measure with him, was
slim in a beautiful frock. Streamline, it
flowed in pearly sheen to a short train,
and was glistening with silver sequins
from above the waist to the hips. She
carried a fan of pearl-grey feathers.
Moonlight-blue satin patterned in gold
formed Mrs. Hubert Fairfax’s frock ;
Jean Rankin’s satins burned like a
sapphire, and until after the debs.’ pre-
sentations her flowing sleeves were stac-
catos in chiffon. Mrs. Colin Venn's black
satin was Jit with diamente ; Miss S. F.
Warby’s frock gleamed golden. There
were Dangars, Macarthur Onslows,
Osbornes; one of the tireless dancers
was Mrs. George Rayner. Jean Cheriton
was a good-looker in ivory satin, and
Mrs. Bonham Carter’s unusual frock had
all autumn in it.
One of Maoriland's pretty girls greets
you herewith. Christine Parr, whose
father is High Commissioner for Enzed,
goes off to join her father in London
early next year. Christine, who is just
leaving school, was one of the group of
Doone girls who made their bow to the
Duke at the C.W.A. Ball. Realising that
life isn’t all Dukes and frivols, the young
thing has specialised in secretarial work.
The Duke makes a hobby of collecting
menus, and the menu of the State dinner
at Canberra greatly excited his interest.
It was a reproduction of a landscape by
Elioth Griiner, the original of which is
owned by Dame Eadith Walker. On
learning that it had been painted in the
neighborhood the Duke asked if he might
be taken to the scene, and visited it the
following day. Then he expressed the
desire to see the painting when he came
to Sydney.
Getting a card for the Dangar dance
was the society hall-mark of the week. This
was given by Noreen and Patsy Dangar,
and no amount of tactics could have
got you inside the Rose Bay Golf Club.
Two enormous lobsters shone splendidly
red on the supper-tables, and the most-
commented-on dish was the hot lobster
served on the shell. The drinks equalled
the eats, and it was one of those hospit-
able, old-fashioned suppers served all
through the night. Noreen, who wore a
long train to her off-white satins, man-
aged it after the Delysia manner, but
some of the trains swirled round the feet
of man, an almost irresistible whirlpool,
and suffered casualties. Patsy Dangar
wore lily-of-the-valley with her silveL
frock. Mrs. Hubert Gordon, the girls’
mother, was impressive in flowing blue
crepes, and aunt Mrs. C. L. Lewin, who
lives in Jersey, in the Channel Isles,
turned the happy fourpence-in-the-
pound-income-tax look on a company
lhat included Mrs. Dick Dangar, hand-
somely frocked in two tones ol lilac.
There was an overflow of men, among
them Captain Derek Schreiber, of the
Prince’s staff, and a group ol the .Sussex
officers. •
Frangipanni trailing from the wrist was
the graceful way in which the 16 debs,
of the Young Australia League Ball wore
their flowers. All
th e youngsters
were in white
trained frocks, and
each was partnered
by an officer from
the Sussex. Their
presentation to the
Governor and
Lady Game and
their own waltz,
which followed,
were the show
pieces of an even-
ing rich with gold
braid—there were
men of the French
Navy as well as
our own sea war-
riors on deck —and
spirited with the
music of the
Y.A.L. band. Lady
Game’s frock was
long and trained
and of green vel-
vet, and had pearl
a c c ompaniments;
the Julius lady’s
white satins were
widely sashed in
wine-color. The C.
J. Popes came, as
did the Bonham
Carters and the
Randle Fords.
There was one
supper-table carry-
ing a model of the
Sussex. This was
moored on a mir-
ror lake and sur-
rounded by small
floral craft. Ships
seemed to be the
favorite table de-
coration. Valerie
Bavin’s white
frock ended in a pleated train, and
Mrs. F. J. Davy’s fairness shone bright
above amethystine crepes. Satin, rich and
red, fashioned Miss Nancy Jobson’s
frock; Mrs. C. V. Baily passed, a flash
of golden sequins; Mrs. Marie’s bur-
gundy frock had its cape gold-lined.
France invaded the Forum Club on
a bright afternoon last week, and the
cocktail hour spread merrily from five to
seven. Glasses were raised in honor of
the officers of the visiting French sloop
Amiral Charner. The Tricolor flut-
tered above this assembly, which was a
gesture from the Alliance Fran?aise and
the French Chamber of Commerce, and
the flower pieces were arranged in
France’s colors. The Alfred Wunder-
lichs, of the Alliance, and the Chamber
of Commerce Pelletier couple made a
bright reception foursome. Black and
white, Paris’s choice for smart wear, was
allied in the raiment of both ladies.
Delysia came to this party. France’s
Consul-General Dussap and his wife and
Belgium’s Consul Segaert were among
those who exchanged politenesses with
Captain Adelus of the trig warship.
Sir Fabian and Lady Ware passed
through Sydney on their way to Maori-
land last week. He is the permanent
vice-chairman of the Imperal War Graves
Commission, so the two have a link with
Australia, although this is a first visit.
They have been the guests of Govern-
ment House, and the Victoria League’s
garden party in their honor was one of
that society’s outstanding successes. The
grounds of Ginaghulla (the home ot
the “Herald” Miss Fairfax) on Bellevue
Hill, with their terraced slopes and lawns,
surrounded the affair with scent of flower
and green tracery of leaf, and Leaguers
came from far and near, for Lady Ware
is a member of the hospitality committee
of the London branch. An ensemble of
grey-and-blue-patterned chiffons, its coat
of navy taffeta, was worn by the
guest. Miss Macarthur Onslow and Miss
Fairfax attended to the receiving.
The National Council of Women sur-
rounded its farewell to Lady Game with
tea and flowers. The flowers, of delicate
hue, overbrimmed a basket, and to this
was clasped a silver boomerang that said
“Please come back again.” The lounge
on the first floor of the Australia was
crowded, for the National Councillors
were reinforced by members of almost
every welfare movement for women and
children. Lots of C.W.A. enthusiasts were
among the speech applauders, and if
some did nod a bit over their tea-tables
in the drowsy air you couldn’t blame
them, for they had only got home from
the Duke’s ball at three o’clock in the
morning. “When we return to England,”
said the Governor’s wife happily, “we
will be five barrackers for Australia for
the rest of our lives.” Her speech touched
on the work of many social organisa-
tions, was clear and comprehensive and
about ten minutes long.
The Navy has wolfed up all our spot-
light. Dances and cocktail parties in
honor of the braSs-bound lads have
simply chased one another madly and
gladly through the week that’s gone. The
E.-S.U.’s dance was for the officers of
the Sussex, the Canberra and the Aus-
tralia, and filled the comfortable old
yacht club at Kirribilli with mirth and
the slither of dancing feet. Launches
and rowboats disgorged early at the
club’s private wharf, for their cargoes
were junior officers. In frocks of silver
and blue and pink 12 girls, supported by
E.-S.U. chairman Colonel Spain and
Mrs. Maurice Gulson, smart in black
and white satin stripes, waited at the
entrance to receive the guests. Mrs.
Spain trailed black chiffons ; tea-rose satin
gleamed on Mrs. Arthur Scrivener. Mrs.
Wallace Turner’s black laces, and blue
and pink flower pieces were other deco-
rations of the night.
On the Kamo Maru last Thursday
night dancers in the interest of the Bal-
main and District Hospital paused in
their labors and clustered around the
radio in the ship’s smokeroom to hear
the broadcast of the royal wedding.
Spiky branches of peach-blossom, trails
of wistaria, pink and blue flowers, and
lanterns with their silken tassels brought
Japan to Walsh Bay, where the ship was
berthed. In the supper-room a Japanese
temple in a grove of pines won admira-
tion, not only for itself but for the chef
who had fashioned it from sugar. Lady
Game brought pale-green frocking and
Lady Ware. The latter wore trailing
vellum satins.
A small country girl, after listening to
the broadcast of the royal wedding, said,
“Oh, mother, isn’t it lovely? She’ll be
Australia’s own Princess —such a nice
woolly name!”

Melbourne
Chatter
Melbourne, so lately the scene of
pageants and splendid celebrations, is
to-day a sorely-stricken city. The great
storm that raged on Thursday and Fri-
day flooded the Yarra, as well as other
streams. Chelsea and part of South
Yarra were under water on Sun-
day, and crowds lined the Yarra watch-
ing the swirling brown waters carrying
away the lighter bridges. Thousands
of folk are homeless, many lives have
been lost, and the city’s electrical
supply is endangered by the dam-
age done at Yallourn. The dead sheep’s
head on our centenary medallion has a
grim significance now, for in Gippsland
thousands of sheep lie drowned. Rescue
work was promptly organised, and we
at least have the satisfaction of knowing
that we can still cope with a sudden
emergency.
Tram and telephone services were
disorganised and rowing-boats and canoes
rescued the marooned and delivered pro-
visions. While beautiful elms and poplars
which have taken 50 years to grow
crashed in the Gardens and along St.
Kilda-road a number of the flimsy
Chinese lanterns remained aloft in Fitz-
roy Gardens. That most of the pylons
and “candy poles” withstood the storm
at all is a credit to the thorough work of
their builders. The riverbed which runs
through Heyington was a wide stretch of
inland sea. Kooyong’s centre courts
could have been used for swimming and
high-diving displays, for only the top
was visible of the amphitheatre built by
the L.T.A. in anticipation of the crowds
expected for this week’s centenary tennis.
Along the foreshore of the bay the sea
swept through buildings, leaving layers
of white sand over the ground floors and
clots pf scudding spray on the furniture.
During the Associated Public Schools’
centenary day old Parliament House,
Exhibition Building, rubbed the sleep out
of its eyes to listen to speeches by women
(it had heard too much talk by men in
its younger days to bother to stay awake
for a male oration). There were morn-
ing and afternoon sessions of the con-
gress, and in the evening a dinner at the
Wattle. A very jolly dinner it was.
Piano, ’cello and violin did their best to
be heard above the chatter, but it was
difficult. Down the official table fairy
lamps glimmered in the thickest part of
a miniature hedge of briar roses and
feathery heath. Draped across one end
of the room were the banners of the four
affiliated schools, M.L.C., P.L.C., Church
of England Grammar and Geelong
Grammar. The president, Miss F.
Fraser, proposed the health of the King,
and afterwards, “as we are a gathering
of women,” toasts of the Queen and of
the Duchess of Kent were honored. Mrs.
F. W. Kitchen wore brown-and-orange-
striped lame, Miss M.. Minifie was in
peacock velvet and Mrs. A. L. Abbott
was diagonally striped with bronze,
brown and green taffetas. Miss Haw-
thorn disclosed a sense of humor in her
yarn of the hungry lions who rushed at
the Christian licking their chops, but who
suddenly slunk off, tails down, when the
martyr whispered in their ears “Now,
remember, you’ll have to make an after-
dinner speech.” Other special guests
were Dr. Dora Peyser, Dr. Brandt, who
made a short speech, and tall Dr. Anita
Rosenberg, Mrs. A. S. Morton, with glit-
tery crystal beads on black lace, Miss H.
Hailes in deep burgundy, Mrs. E. Lan-
den and Miss Gilman Jones in blue
a-sparkle upon the shoulders. Miss A.
Peterson, Mrs. I. H. Moss and Mrs. Basil
Kilvington spoke through the “mike,”
which with its leafy camouflage was
moved hither and thither.
With the rest of the Empire, Mel-
bourne listened-in to the really marvel-
lous broadcast of the royal wedding. Pos-
sibly for the next royal wedding tele-
vision will be universal and we’ll see the
bridal party in all its splendor. Apart
from royal nuptials we’ve had a week
the first part of which bubbled with tulle
and confetti.
Brides who have experienced the feel-
ing of plunging a knife into a beautiful
wedding cake are wondering how the
Duchess of Kent felt when, armed with
her husband’s sword, she was confronted
with a glittering magnificence eight feet
high. The cake was in four tiers, and
cost £5OO. Possibly the cooks would
have liked more time to “mellow” it by
a much earlier baking, but they couldn’t
manage that owing to a short engage-
nient and the time taken to collect special
ingredients before commencing the enor-
mous job of mixing and stirring. There
were special currents from Greece
gathered by Grecian girls ; the rest of the
fruit came from Australia and Canada
provided the flour. Hidden in the lowest
tier were golden charms —a wedding
ring, a thimble, a button, a horseshoe, a
dove a donkey and a threepenny-bit.
The perfume from magnolia in the
bridal sheaves, and of lilies, Canterbury
bells and golden broom in brass bowls
placed by the chancel steps, was wafted
on a sunny afternoon through St. John’s,
Toorak. The floral setting was in honor
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Lyon’s eldest
daughter Barbara and Arthur Goodwill,
of Adelaide. The bride’s satin gown
showed a square neckline, and her tulle
veil, with one filmy layer over the hair,
was gathered closely at the nape of the
neck, to swirl forth into a wide cascade
over the long train. Small Louise Barrett,
clad to her toes in pale-gold satin, car-
ried a gilt basket of flowers, and a quin-
tet of ’maids, also in gold, wore shoulder-
length tulle veils and carried sheaves of
creamy water-lilies. Felicitations were in
the air at No. 9.
Here is an Esler picture of Margot,
younger daughter of Mr. and Mrs. O. T.
Lempriere, who kept an appointment at
All Saints’, East St. Kilda, with Archi-
bald Hugh, only son of the H. G. Tur-
ners, of Sandringham. Under a thistle-
down layer of tulle veil the bride’s white
robe descended into a long square train
between elongated draperies floating
from the flared skirt. Pat Newbigin
and Nell Healy carried out the ’maids’
duties in swaying clouds of sunset net
over taffeta foundations, with roses in
their hair and more roses lying in sheaves
across their arms. The cake was cut
at No. 9.
Tempe Falkiner cherishes neither
superstitions nor conventional ideas
about bridal raiment. With Hal William
Watt she faced the altar of Christ
Church, South Yarra, in a gown and misty
tulle veil of apple-green. A chaplet of
blossoms was worn in her hair, and more
blossom outlined the bateau neck of her
chiffon gown. Mary Guy Smith attended
in flower-scattered white ninon and an
outsize in cartwheel hats, made from
alternating layers of Swiss straw and
organdie. Relations only were invited to
the church, but a multitude of guests
attended Mrs. Norman Falkiner’s cock-
tail party, which she gave instead of the
customary wedding breakfast.
Pat Duigan, tall and slim in her moulded
white satin gown with its long sleeves
and off-the-shoulder scarf draperies, en-
tered Melbourne Grammar School
chapel under the escort' of her brother
and emerged later in the safe keeping of
Dick Hiscock. ’Groom’s sister Peggy and
Joan a’Beckett were spring poems in
palest eau-de-nil gowns with quaint
winged sleevelets and pleats down the
back which lapped the floor in a sugges-
tion of train. Both bride and ’maids car-
ried lovely tall sheaves of Christmas-lilies.
Afterwards the bride’s mother, Mrs. H.
McL. Duigan, entertained at Grosvenor.
One of the prize-winning plays in the
competition run‘by the A.B.C. is from
the pen of Mrs. R. M. Harvey, of
Elsternwick. Mrs. Harvey has been
writing since her childhood. She has
studied particularly the drama of the
ancient Greek and Elizabethan schools.
In her own work she concentrates for
atmosphere more on dialogue than on
setting, so that the job of rendering her
plays suitable for broadcasting is fairly
easy. Her first efforts at play-writing
were in blank verse, but after concentrat-
ing on the technical side of stage pro-
ductions she became more practical. She
has had verse in The Bulletin. Mrs.
Harvey before her marriage was Joan
Cox, of Hobart. She went to school
abroad, and as a young girl studied art.
Here is Dr. Anita Rosenberg, one of
the visitors to Melbourne for Women’s
International Congress Week. Dr. Rosen-
berg arrived in Australia with the idea
of spending four months with her brother,
who is on the land at Armadalei (W.A.),
but she liked the Westralian climate so
much that she remainedi 16 months.
Melbourne’s wintry spring makes her feel
at home, for it reminds her of Berlin in
December. She has lived many years in
Berlin, but was born at Giessen, an old
city of historical interest. It possesses
a town hall dated 1265, and a tower
erected for the imprisonment of “witches
and heathen.” Dr. Rosenberg, who is a
a Doctor of Laws, comes from a legal
family. Her father and one of her
brothers practise law in Germany, as did
her grandfather and great-grandfather.
She has studied social work, and has
qualified as a teacher at a school for
social training. During the war she
worked through' the Red Cross on the
job of exchanging prisoners of war.
Broothorn made the portrait.
American investigators are pursuing
algae in Australian waters. Prof. Jose-
phine E. Tilden, who occupies the Chair
of Botany at Minnesota, is leading 10 of
her most brilliant students over a course
of study which they have chosen for the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The
scientists have sought out algae among
the rocky coves of Rottnest Island and at
the Margaret River in W.A., and have
been busy lately at Point Lonsdale. This
week they leave to spend 17 days in Tas-
mania before going on to Collaroy Beach
(N.S.W.). They always take a furnished
house (the Collaroy bungalow was en-
gaged six months ago), Prof. Tilden being
experienced in such campaigns. The
botanists work according to the tides.
Luncheon may be any time from ten in
the morning till three in the afternoon.
The students wear trousers and high hob-
nailed boots, not waders, for they never
attempt to keep dry. They work in zones,
and occasionally the student allotted the
deepest zone hunts his or her quarry in
a bathing-suit. After a long day in the
open air, rain or sunshine, there’s more
work to be done far into the night, com-
piling notes, etc., and attending to the
day’s catch.
In the party are Caroline M. Crosby,
three married couples and three unmar-
ried men. Mr. and Mrs. Warnock lived
in the Philippines for nine years. Mrs.
Warnock has studied education, and
makes a point of visiting Australian
schools. Mr. and Mrs. A. Nash hail
from Yellowstone National Park, where
in summer Mr. Nash lectures on the
botany and zoology of the Park and
studies the algae which inhabit its hot-
water streams. He is looking forward to
meeting Maoriland’s hot-water algae.
L. R. Jones specialises in marine photo-
graphy, and Mrs. Jones, not profession-
ally interested in marine growths, is in-
specting our hospitals and meeting
women social workers. Another talented
cameraman is P. J. Philson, who is a
Southerner, like T. T. Earl. L. A. Doore’s
secondary interest is commercial art. He
works the party’s theodolite, and is its
official map- and chart-maker.
The whole of the first floor at Mount
St. Evins Hospital has been put at the
service of ecclesiastics visiting Melbourne
for the Eucharistic Congress. The en-
trance lounge and the spacious hall at
the top of the stairs are filled with flowers,
the green foliage of pot-plants and hang-
ing baskets of fern. The rooms at Mount
St. Evins are always cheerful. Each
has its color scheme ; the linen is hand-
embroidered and beautifully laundered.
Interior decorators have swished a
paintbrush or roll of wallpaper here
and there, and the sisters have replaced
cushions and curtains which had lost
their first bloom. Every room has its
reading-lamp. In the dining-room (usu-
ally a ward of four beds) subdued lights
are reflected in the polished wood of a
long table. Archbishops Kelly, Clune
and Duhig occupy white bedrooms at-
tractive with chintzes. Monsignor
Nolan’s room is done in rose, and pale
jade-green is used in the decoration of
Monsignor King’s domicile. Up on the
top floor of the building is the chapel,
but it is small, so that a temporary
chapel has been made ready for the visi-
tors. On the balcony of the first floor
a dais has been erected. The Papal
Legate is staying with Archbishop Man-
nix. Cardinal Macßory wears impos-
ing scarlet robes, and for formal occa-
sions the “cappa magna,” a red cloak of
State with a long train.
Some of the bishops are clad in plain
black, and others wear black gowns with
red pipings and red socks with black
shoes. Seven German priests, very tall
men with flowing beards, are waiting
for the congress before proceeding as
missionaries to New Guinea. The bishop
of their future diocese is" a Dutchman,
Bishop Vesters, a man with an agile
mind and body, a trim beard and a quick
eye and tongue ; he speaks 14 languages.
Bishop Bach has lately relinquished the
care of his scattered flock, which is
spread through the Pacific upon the Gil-
bert and Ellice groups of islands and
Nauru and Ocean Island. Transport
among the coral atolls and treacherous
uncharted passages is by copra trading
vessels. Another bishop from the Pacific
is Bishop Wade, of the northern Solo-
mons. Father Lyons, from New Guinea,
has brought two “boys,” dusky-skinned
converts, with him. Father Long comes
from Alice Springs. He sometimes tra-
vels 1000 miles per week, per foot, camel
and car, to visit his parishioners, who
are scattered over 230,000 square miles.
After liberal doses of music and
drama, good, bad and indifferent, Mel-
bourne is delighted at the art of dancing
as expressed by the Russian Ballet.
Whereas in grand opera the singer pelts
out his or her notes with practically no
attempt at acting, dancers in the ballet
give a sympathetic interpretation of every
emotion. In place of Spessiva, who is
nursing an injured ankle, Natasha Bojko-
vich was prima ballerina; her Slavonic
type and the sleek attraction of the other
dancers, who are nearly all brunettes, is
a welcome change from the platinum
blondes, curls and baby smiles of the
movies and musical comedy. Juliana
Enakieva is 14, and should be capable
with such gorgeous black eyes of getting
anything she wants in the world. She
was an entrancing flowergirl in “Promen-
ade,” where the fairy-footed ladies of
Old Vienna rustled organdie dresses over
frilled organdie pantalettes, and Elvira
Rone coquetted in whirls of blue chif-
fon. With Stanley Judson as partner,
Kathleen Crofton achieved the effect of
floating over the starlit stage in “Noc-
turne.”

BY APPOINTMENT TO H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES
Each number on the programme
seemed more marvellous than the last,
and no one realised that it was 11 o’clock
after the “Dance of the Hours.” Among
those in the audience at the King’s were
Mrs. George Caro, wearing earrings of
beaten silver and a little white fur cape.
Two white-satin-clad figures were Mrs.
Conway Seymour and her sister Alison
Macarthur. Mrs. Charles Osborn re-
moved her fur coat to disclose a cherry-
red velvet wrap of smaller dimensions.
Eve Sheedy wore black velvet with a
scarlet wing emblazoned across the front
of the corsage.
Owing to the storm and delay in ship-
ping six German nuns were able to wit-
ness the opening of the Eucharistic Con-
gress before continuing their journey to
Rabaul. The sisters are all young —some
look barely 20 —and because of their
youth and lack of fluent English they
are rather shy. They are happy souls,
and simple things give them an enormous
amount of pleasure. They are “pleased
to see your beautiful city,” which at
present looks its windblown worst, and
were thrilled at calling at two ports on
the journey out, Teneriffe and Adelaide.
They were trained as nurses and teachers
at Munster in Westfalen, and their first
and probably only journey away from
their native land is to Vunapope, in the
wilds of New Guinea, which may after-
wards mean work on a leper station.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
We’ve had a heat-wave ; for a couple
of days the temperature was near the
century. Several families left town
for their homes in the hills. The T. E.
Barr-Smiths went to Aldgate, and
the John Bakers and the Walter Bagots
to Mount Lofty. But unfortunately the
two warm days were a flash in the pan,
and we returned to fires within and a
cold gale without.
It rained for the opening of the Yacht
Squadron season, but that mattered little,
as everyone expects to be wet more or
less at a function of that sort. The Gov-
ernor, with Commander Bernard Phillips
in attendance, was the guest of vice-com-
modore M. Mitchell on the flagship
Grelka, where Dr. and Mrs. Rex Matters
were the only other guests. Mrs. W. T.
Mortlock was on her son’s yacht Martin-
dale. Her sister-in-law, Mrs. F. A. Ten-
nant, was also one of the party. There
was a flannel dance in the evening, which
made a cheery wind-up.
There was a civic reception for Cap-
tain Sir lan Fraser, of St. Dunstan’s,
England, and Lady Fraser. Sir lan re-
newed his acquaintance with several
blind soldiers he had known in England
during the war. The reception-room was
ablaze with gaillardias and gladioli. Lady
Fraser wore a deep-maize coat and skirt',
and a hat to tone.
The English women cricketers received
their welcome from Adelaide in the room
of the Lady Mayoress.
WESTRALIA.
The Manunda was outlined with
strings of colored lights for the Kinder-
garten Union’s bridge and dancing
shivoo. Kiddies in costume trod the
decks until 10 p.m., when Mrs. E. B.
Sinclair, in blue and silver, handed out
prizes, and the Adelaide Steamship Co.’s
manager, J. H. Downer, distributed sou-
venirs. Then there was dancing for
adults, interspersed with ballets. Organ-
iser Mrs. M. Withall pinned a spray of
white camellias on her black georgettes ;
Mrs. W. H. Taylor helped judge the cos-
tumes in flowing crepes of periwinkle
blue.
Pat Lang and Tom Kennedy were mar-
ried at St. Mary’s Cathedral. Magistrate
Lang’s arm held the long sleeve of his
daughter’s Paris suede georgette with its
wealth of pintucks running horizontally
to the tucked flared frills which formed
her train. A wreath of buttercups en-
circled her drooping ballibuntal. Jean
Lang’s posy of crimson roses was held
against bisque angel-skin georgette, high-
necked and frilled at the back from
shoulder to the hem of her demi-train,
and topped with velvet-ribboned tabac
Leghorn.
There was a strong rally of the fair
sex at Mrs. E. B. Sinclair’s final recep-
tion as Lady Mayoress. A forest of
palms sprang up in the Town Hall, the
stage was banked with hydrangeas and
fern, and easy chairs were arranged
salonwise on the squashy carpets under-
foot. Lud Mayor Franklin was there
alongside the hostess’s striking black,
which dripped with misty blue lace, and
Marjorie Sinclair’s gold-coin-spot black
crepe de Chine.
For the Cottesloe Golf Club’s merry
hop president Wingrove’s lady wrapped
herself in yards of black floral georg-
ette and saw to the doings at the club-
house. Molly Noble’s revealing red
and white zigzags caught the eye; a
frilly halter was hung over Sheila Mc-
Clement’s electric-blue velvets ; Thelma
Rose girdled and sprayed her snowy con-
fection with blush-rose velvet; Vans
Anderson’s off-white matt crepe clung
alluringly, and Zoe Weir danced in
orchid matelasse.
At the Linton Sketch Club’s exhibition
at Newspaper House Art Gallery most
of the work came from artists yet in
their teens. Mr. Battye opened the
show, and lauded Ingrid Ackland, whose
water-colors comprised more, than one-
fifth of the section. Betty Pretty, whose
name appeared on half a dozen hang-
ings, was demure in fine-striped Prussian-
blue cloth; Mrs. C. Battye’s sepia en-
semble was parked near Mattie Hodg-
son’s “Cineraria,” and Rabbi Freedman
quizzed the walls through his monocle.
Elsie Eilbeck, shielding beige mate-
lasse with a black ballibuntal carrying
black accessories, but minus a bouquet,
kept a tryst with Pat Hazelitt at St.
Mary’s, West Perth. Ethel Eilbeck, Mrs.
Hazelitt, senr., and Mrs. T. Eilbeck were
there.
TASMANIA.
Foreign warships have been making
their acquaintance with Hobart harbor
these last weeks. Following the Italian
cruiser came the French sloop Amiral
Charner, and a few days later arrived the
Indian troopship Hindustan. Captains
Adelus (French) and Cooper (R.1.N.)
were entertained at G.H., and picnics,
dances and dinners kept both’ officers and
crews on the go
The Lyceum Club gave a reception to
Lady Montgomery and Mrs. Percy
Grainger. Lady Clark was not well
enough to attend, but Mrs. John Downie,
the Mayoress, the Nicholls lady, Mrs.
Stourton and other committee members
received the guests. Music and recita-
tions whiled away the time.
Lady Moore (London) arrived in Laun-
ceston in time to be at the Batman
celebrations there. She is a great-
granddaughter of Batman. The north-
ern Fifty Thousand League broke its rule
as to the admission of women, and enter-
tained Lady Moore, the Mayoress and
other womenfolk at a luncheon during
the celebrations.
Mr. and Mrs. T. Murdoch gave a
cheery tea-party at Highfield Hall for
the MacDonalds, brother and sister, dur-
ing their short visit. The hostess did
the honors in black-and-silver grey, with
hat touched with silver lamd. Tables were
decked with roses and pink sweet-peas.
Sir Fabian Ware and his lady were
guests of the Lieut.-Governor and Lady
Lewis while in Hobart. Sir Fabian is per-
manent vice-chairman of the Imperial
War Graves Commission, and before his
lecture on the subject at the City Hall
the Lieut.-Governor and Lady Lewis gave
a small dinner-party in their own home
in honor of the visitors.
Marion Eva (Pixie) Tabart and Dr.
F. R. Vincent, of Geelong, were made
one at St. James’s, which the bride’s
friends had decorated with masses of
lilies and pale-colored roses. The
ding garment was a sumptuous affair of
gold and silver brocade, mediaeval in style,
with cowl effect at neck and very long
sleeves. A gold girdle was worn round
the waist, and a little gold-and-silver
halo held the pale-gold tulle veil at the
head, whence it flowed out over the
dress. Wanda Piesse (cousin), sole ’maid,
was a study in gold with a trained
metallic lacquered frock that matched
her hair.
The Speck has upheld its end of the
literary stick in the A.B.C. competi-
tion for plays and sketches. If we can
claim Mrs. Joan Harvey (formerly Joan
Cox, of Hobart), we have won second
and third places in the play section. Mrs.
Bertha Southey Brammall’s “Flickering
Candles” got the second prize, Joan
Harvey’s “Light Breaking Through” was
third, and Mrs. Ann Brough won one of
the additional £5 prizes with “The Piano
Tuner.” H. B. Richard and Millicent
Rowntree are also to have plays pro-
duced.

I.
Believe me, won’t you, dear, when l
swear true
That if you’d squeaked — now, please,
my love, just wait
And give me half a chance to formu-
late
These tricky rhymes—believe me, had
those blue,
Clear shining eyes that first knocked me
askew
Soon closed in death, and left me
desolate,
Or, well, let’s say as good as celibate
Because of all the cash I’d spent on you :
If Fate had skittled my too-short-lived
joy,
And torn away from me my dearest
Bess,
Then by my faith, I had been done
with love !
Yet I’d much rather, sweet, have been
your boy
Friend for one hour and died
quite penniless
Than live for years when you
were parked above.

Or had those lips that of all lips
first met
These lips of mine, and lin-
gered to their kiss,
Swift turned to scorn, and
hastened to dismiss
The lover caught within your
filmy net;
Or if you’d twisted, my bold
young coquette,
Lit up my heart, and filled it
with sheer bliss,
And then, at once, as some
bad-tempered miss,
Had stabiped it underfoot with-
out regret :
Then, even then, believe me, on
my life,
Believe me I’d have loved
you still, stamped flat!
Believe me what, you
won’t? And never can?
Now ! Now ! Don’t get so
fussy ! My dear wife,
I’m sure you’re right! Belief
as strong as that
Would make these lies too
easy for a man.

Brutality:
AIVs Well!
It would be 5n
interesting experi-
ment to take a
sample of the
genus censor, say
a film censor.
and, by means of a machine yet to be
invented, unravel the tortuous whorls of
thought that have produced finally some
of the decisions which have startled the
citizenry of this fair land.
How gratifying it would be really to
know the reason for “The Five Year
Plan” being banned, for large chunks of
“The Silence of Dean Maitland” being
slashed, for “When the Kellys Rode”
being interdicted in toto.
But how much more illuminating it
would be to discover how such a film as
that depicting the assassination of the
late King Alexander of Yugoslavia re-
ceived the censorial O.K., with the result
that men, women and children may now
view, in any one of a number of theatres,
the spectacle of a man in his death
agony, lying in the bottom of a car, while
eager photographers and cinema men
crowd about, like so many vultures, eager
to snatch their share of this royal feast
of “news.”
Can anyone name a more horrible and
ghastly thing that has suffered to be
shown on Australian screens?
Only very occasionally is death a rea-
sonably calm and dignified affair. Even
in these rare cases it would lose whatever
nobility it might possess if it were pur-
veyed as entertainment to the mob. But
to see it in the guise in which it came to
the late King Alexander is to see it in
its most revolting form. Hardly less
revolting are the accompanying scenes
showing a maddened, frenzied crowd
attacking the assassin. Certainly he is not
shown being torn limb from limb ; but
the shouts of the infuriated mob, milling
about his prostrate body, ought to be
sufficient even for the toughest among us.
It has not occurred to our censors that
such stufi' might not be good fare for a
populace already living, through the
medium of the press, on a cultural diet of
divorce, murder and gangster stories.
Apparently censors are far too busily
intent on hunting down any suggestion
of “sex” (taking- the word in its strict
censorial definition) in pictures to spare
time to cull out anything that is merely
ugly, sickening and morbid.
It should only need another couple of
assassins, with newsreel men on the scene,
to ensure that the final agonies of the
victim, the blood, the labored breathing,
the glazed eyes are not lost to those who
were not fortunate enough to witness
these phenomena in actuality, and we
should see the more up and coming of
our newspapers emulating the American
“tabloids,” which make a specialty of
corpses and count the day lost when they

cannot give their million readers an artis-
tic photograph of a perforated gangster
or, more interesting still, a lovely lady
surprised with her boy friend by an un-
reasonable husband at a time when the
latter has his razor on him. A couple
more assassin films and we shall be ready
for this. In the meantime, it would be
interesting to know how a censor’s mind
works. Always, of course, supposing
that it does.

times, on visiting
The Bulletin to
collect, I had been
aware of a tall,
spare, mumbling
man, with most curious brown eyes.
Those eyes always seemed to me to be
looking across continents instead of
streets, and into the heart of everything
instead of a teacup.
A. G. Stephens introduced him as
Henry Lawson, and, obsessed as I was
with my own work, I made time to be
friends with and study the writer who,
above all others, has given us the true
spirit of Australia.
So, when I could, I went out in the
lunch hour to the Domain and bared my
head in the rain to the memory of Henry
Lawson.
But not to his statue. Had my strength
been equal to my anger, I would have
heaved up that statue, granite base and
all, and hurled it into the deepest hole in
Woolloomooloo Bay.
This the true spirit of Australia, as
typified by Henry Lawson! He should
have been standing erect and proud, gaz-
ing as across a continent. Instead, he
stands on his monument with hands
dangling aimless and a vacant grin on
his face, like a silly schoolboy caught
stealing apples. Instead of a prick-eared
cattle-dog at his feet, standing at gaze
alert for work, as the true breed ever
does, a mongrel lurcher (peculiarly an
English dog) huddles beside him in an
unnatural attitude. Behind him shows a
split, mortised post (about as common
in the outback country as a blue
diamond), and a swagman crouches on
his left in another unnatural attitude: no
sign of the indispensable tucker-bag, and
his billy just where he would kick it over
when he moved his foot.
The first essential of all art is Truth, or
What Actually Is. With it, genius has
the power of putting great thoughts into
deeds of ink, or canvas, or bronze, or
marble. If rightly wrought, those
thoughts burn like a flame for ever.
Wrongly, they fall to dust, and thrust
themselves and their maker into oblivion,
leaving naught but shame and dishonor
behind them.
Lambert in his day was a fine painter ;
but to my mind he has completely mis-
judged Lawson, and he should have had
an experienced bushman to direct him
in the practical details.
Also, a true statue of Lawson should
have been placed in our beautiful
Botanic Gardens, close to the main
entrance, where, as I know well, the
flowers and shrubs and soft cooing of
the doves were inexpressibly soothing to
a ■ mind often jarred to madness by the
pettiness of the practical world about
him.
No blame attaches to the sponsors ;
they all did their best. The blame must
lie on Lambert in that he failed to inter-
pret the soul of Henry Lawson.
ROBERT KALESKI.
Buckmaster,
Kipling of the
Brush
Any poetaster
can tell you
what’s wrong with
Kipling, and any
painter or critic
of painting can
advance you 33 reasons why the
work of young Ernest Buckmaster
can’t be considered high art. His
worst faults seem to be that his
pictures are understandable to a child
of five, that his meaning and inten-
tion are crystal-clear and that every-
one of his canvases “clicks.” He first
came under public notice as a portraitist.
His portraits looked exactly like the
sitters, which, of course, is. very, very
wrong ; and, for some reason which the
high artists have never been able to dis-
cover, he was awarded the Archibald
Prize two years ago.
There is a very fair market even in
Australia for recognisable portraits. An
industrious painter of such low-brow
trifles ought to be able to earn almost
as much income as an accountant in a
steady job.
Instead of which, this young upstart
has plunged into the landscape and still-
life fields, carrying to them all those
bourgeois rules of draughtsmanship and
perspective to which the high artists are
so happily superior. Thirty-two of his
essays along these lines hang on the walls
of Anthony Horderns’ Gallery, Sydney.
■ The landscapes glow with genuine Aus-
' Talian sunlight (it has a different tint
; from that of any other country); each is
interesting and enjoyable to the man in
the street, and each says something vastly
complimentary to Dame Nature. The
still-lifes look exactly like what they
represent. Brass is brass, glass is glass,
grapes are grapes and asters are asters—
all utterly wrong, of course ; and matters
are not improved by the fact that com-
position is so contrived as to give every
piece a decorative spirit. It wouldn’t be
so bad if the brush-work were niggling
and finicky, but if you put your nose
near these canvases you see broad, flat
brush strokes such as are laid on the
side of a house by another sort of crafts-
man.
Thirty years ago we should have called
this chap an impressionist, and thus
damned him utterly. Now we can only
condemn him for doing in paint what
Kipling does in words—expressing the
ideas and sensations of common men so
exactly and so plainly that they say:
“Why, I always felt that; I always knew
it. I his fellow talks my language.”

If Rex Battar-
bee and John
A. Gardner have
not grossly exag-
gerated the colors
revealed by the
Central Australian landscape, the Never-
Never country ought to be a serious
rival to the Grand Canyon and
divert a wealth of tonrist traffic when
communication and accomodation im-
prove. These young men are Central
addicts. They can’t keep away
from the great open spaces
where men are men. They feel
cramped and congested when
circumstances force them to
visit Hermannsburg Mission,
and they absolutely abhor the
bustle and roar of Alice Springs.
Their one joy is to get out,
many miles from any white
person, and paint what they see.
Having done so, they take their
courage in both hands, gird up
their tubes of color and venture
into Melbourne, where they are
now exhibiting their pictures at
the Athenaeum. Battarbee is a
water-colorist; Gardner sticks
to oil; both possess a great
color sense, keen observation
and a good sense of composi-
tiorr. In drawing and technique,
their work would be consider-
ably improved by more study—
a criticism which might fairly
be levelled at some of the
world’s best-known artists. Bat-
tarbee is at his best with such
a landscape as “The Blue Mac-
donnells,” a glorious piece of
decoration, as are also “Moun-
tain Range, Amulda,” and
“Evening in the Macdonnells.”
Possibly his most striking work
is a water-color of “Stanley
Chasm,” a piece of glowing
orange with unique lighting.
Gardner is at his best in his smaller can-
vases —yellows and pinks and purples, all
splendidly harmonising—though “The
Valley of the Finke River at Inchulim-
bah,” the largest of all,, is the most
arresting work in the room. “Cathedral
Mountains,” showing remarkable rock
formation, and “The Ranges of Illa-
wurta” are two other works which cause
the spectator to pause. Both artists also
contribute pictures of aboriginal life.
Fred Leist is showing a collection of
oils, water-colors and drawings at
Sedon’s Gallery, Melbourne. A con-
siderable number of the exhibits deal
with views of Middle Harbor within a
stone’s-throw of the artist’s house, bath-
ing scenes with golden cliffs and trans-
lucent water and nymphs in multi-
colored costumes —all vibrant with life
and perfectly composed. The outstanding
picture is “Sun Spots,” showing a couple
of bathing girls standing beneath a vine-
covered pergola. The sun rays strike
through the leaves to the figures and the
ground and the water behind. It is a
most difficult bit of painting, and Leist
gets away with it. “Moonlight” is a grace-
ful and particularly beautiful picture of
three nude girls'bathing in a pool near
Balmoral. The drawing and the atmo-
sphere of moonlight are exquisitely
handled. One picture of the point at
Mosman proved a puzzle to the Mel-
burnians who knew not Sydney. The
title was “Musgrave Street,” and the pic-
ture showed a steep declivity, clustered
with houses, dipping into the water. Most
of them studied the picture for some
time and then gave it up. Of the water-
colors, “The Picnic” is the most pleas-
ing. Two portraits are turned out in
the usual Leist manner.

PUTTING UP A PYRAMID
UNK WHITE
DRAWINGS.
BY
JACKS
GULLAN
“Comrades, listen to me. You are downtrodden.
You are being exploited!”
uix 01! slave, come hither.”
The command boomed across
A A the dusty front yard of the
marble palace of Khufu, known as Goof
to his pals, but as King of the Gyppos to
all the rest of the ungodly.
The slave hithered to the splay feet
of his master. Old Khufu had a liver
this hot summer’s morning. The locusts
had got at his rolled oats, and, the milk
supply being much below par, the king,
with very little provocation, would have
thrown his long-suffering subjects into
the muddy Nile.
“Where the devil’s that architect got
to? Tell him I want him, pronto. Come
on, come on ; what’re you waiting for?
Jump to it, soupface.”
A trail of Egyptian dust followed the
dirty feet of the slave as he sprinted for
the one place where he knew the king’s
architect would be. There at a table in
the courtyard of the Inn of the Sacred
Beetle a plump and prosperous form lay
snoring. After spending the night before
in mummifying his inside with firewater,
Dignified aspect of king.
Zigzagotep was in no fit condition to
talk with the king on matters architec-
tural or otherwise. After sundry tugs
at his square-cut beard and hefty blows
at his ribs, the snorer condescended to
awake and hail the smiling morn with the
royal and ancient “ ’Sail ri’, m’dear;
jush little late ; kep’ back at th’ offish—
hie —qui’ all ri’ —hie.”
The slave kept up his
attack, eventually get-
ting the sozzled one to
his feet.
“Snap to it, dumb-
bell, the big boy wants
you! Here, hang on
to my arm and get out
of here!”
The procession
of two staggered
out into the blaz-
ing sunshine, and
the effort of walk-
ing, or trying to
walk, sobered up
the knight of the
square and compas-
ses, so that by the
time they had reached striking distance of
his Nibs the portly one was in most of
whatever senses he ordinarily possessed.
“Sapristi, you waste your nights drink-
ing when I gotta get ahead with this
pyramid. How d’you think I’m gonna
get it finished before sweetie —er, the
queen —gets back if you don’t get on to
the job? Hey! answer me!” A pause.
“Shut up ; don’t talk to me. Move. Get
the gang out carting the rest of those
blocks or you’re for it. I’m just in the
mood to heave a few of you into the
bulrushes.”
With that, Khufu strode over the hori-
zon bellowing out to stragglers who were
slow in getting into the daily labor line-
up. He had a nasty mind.
He steered a course across the burning
sands to where a strange building was
quivering in the haze. There he stood,
jaw jutting westward, hands clasped be-
hind him, and thinking how pleased his
better-half would be at seeing the finished
pyramid, built to last and tell the world
what a great guy Khufu, or Cheops if
you liked his other nickname better, had
been. No jerry-builder was he ; no, sir!
A rising wall of grit betokened not a
sudden storm, but the sweaty arrival of
some hundreds of gents, hauling along
huge blocks of stone weighing anything
from two to three tons each. With a
grunt and a curse and more grunts and
more curses the unwashed citizens gasped
with their burdens into the shadow of
the edifice. They found the king squat-
ting on a piebald block of pyorrhoea or
some similar kind of building material,
squinting along a side of the halt-
completed building.
“H’m, about as straight as a locust’s
hind leg. That block third from this end,
second row, wants pushing in a bit.”
Zigzagotep, fortified by sundry swigs
at a gourd hanging from his girdle and
a ride on the top of one of the stones,
had reached the scene in good time, and
now foolishly butted in:
“Looks straight to me. I can’t make
out”
“What d’you mean, looks straight? I

tect of the pyramids (according to Unk
White).
tell you it isn’t. Any
fool with half an eye
can see it’s crooked.”
“All right, all right;
it’s O.K. with me,
chief.’”
Khufu went puce
with suppressed wrath
and muttered into his
beard.
“By Horus, don’t
bring those Ethio-
pian expressions
here. Get that
stone pushed in
now !”
To emphasise his
point he pushed the
architect face-fore-
most' into the sand, and walked over to
where another figure was moodily and
vacantly surveying nothing. He chewed
a wisp of papyrus, and was almost get-
ting his thoughts connected when the
majestic shadow of the king fell across
his receding brow.
“’Lo, pop, been a lovely day, what!”
drawled the young hopeful, who had
since dawn been successfully dodging his
father for fear of having to answer awk-
ward questions as to who were the ones
responsible for beating up several of the
king’s faithful retainers the previous
night.
But the king was thinking of the job
in hand ; the rest could wait.
“Don’t stand there gaping. Get busy
and polish up some of those stones.”
“Aw, let’s call it a day, pop, and go
for a row down the Nile. I’ll get a
party together, hot stuff.”
Suiting the action to his words,
Khafra, the son, legged it for the town,
The king (conventional portrait).
but had progressed only about two yards
when a hefty hand grabbed him by the
neck.
“You simp, get to work!” Khufu hissed.
At last, by a certain amount of swear-
ing and pushing, he got most of the lads
spread over the 13-acre lot, and a few
stones were hoisted into position until
it looked as if another 5000-odd days
would see the job finished. Khufu was
well aware that the queen might come
home any old time, so that estimate
would have to be reduced a mighty lot.
He even might have to lend a hand him-
self. But not to-day, it was too hot. So
his Majesty propped his carcass against
a palm-tree, sucked noisily at a mint
julep produced by one of his retinue from
his private canteen, and went to sleep.
As soon as the king’s snores sent the
desert sand a-fluttering a lean and sinis-
ter figure slithered across to where the
main body of workers were shoving and
pushing and making a great song and
dance about a little job of work. There
he mounted on a slab and began to ges-
ticulate wildly.
“Comrades, listen to me. You are
downtrodden. You are being exploited
by the hateful capitalists. You are
working your lives out for a pittance.

You are ex-

“Go easy,”
some of the
cautious
ones piped
out, “or the
king’ll hear
you.”

The roots of baby
or first teeth are
grad ually dissolved
and absorbed by
the body, probably
to be used again in
building the per-
manent teeth. Roots
of second teeth are
not absorbed.
THE celebrated first tooth
that causes mother such
excitement and gives father
such pride is really months old
when it breaks through the
gums. For we now find that
teeth begin to form months
before birth and continue to form long
afterwards. Thus scientific men now
believe it possible to actually “build”
strong teeth by having the baby as well
as the adult eat the proper food!
The harder and thicker the enamel of
the teeth, the more resistant they are to
decay. Therefore nutritionists tell ex-
pectant mothers to eat plentifully of
foods containing lime and phosphorus
and certain vitamins so that the baby
will have good teeth. They advise
mothers to feed children tooth-building
foods in large quantities. Milk, oranges,
cod-liver oil are some of these tooth-
building foods.
Dental science explains that decay is
caused by particles of food that lodge on
teeth and under the edges of the gums.
This food is spoiled by certain bacteria.
As it decays, acids are formed which
destroy tooth surfaces. After eating
through the tooth’s hard enamel cover-
ing, these acids proceed to decay the
inner part of the tooth until finally the
nerve is reached and the entire tooth
affected.
One of the scientific methods
of preventing decay after
teeth have once come through
the gums is to remove from
teeth the film, or bacterial
plaque. Film is that slippery,
sticky substance that forms on
teeth. You can feel it with your tongue.
Film is a friend of the germs that cause
decay-producing acids. It glues germs
to the teeth, provides them with a warm
shelter . . . even supplies germs with
food on which to live and multiply.
Thus removing film from teeth means
removing the cause of decay. Important
progress in removing film was made
recently in the laboratories of The Pepso-
dent Company when a new, revolution-
ary cleansing material was developed.
The cleansing and polishing material
is the part of any tooth paste that does
the work. Most cleansing materials are
so hard and abrasive that they scratch
the tooth enamel. Here is the difference
betweep the best tooth paste and in-
ferior brands.
The new Pepsodent cleansing material
is twice as soft as the material com-
monly used in tooth pastes. Pepsodent
Tooth Paste is unsurpassed in cleansing
power and safety.
That is why Pepsodent is known in
67 countries as the special “film-
removing tooth paste.’’

If any illustration in “THE BULLETIN” takes your fancy, write
to the MANAGER, who will quote you price for the original.
“Don’t worry, comrades, the king will
not wake up in a hurry. I have
dr-r-r-rugged him,” and he laughed a
crosscut-saw kind of laugh. “No more
work to-day. Down tools and listen to
me.”
As that exhortation had never been
wilfully ignored since the time an ape-
like creature had dug his first potato
patch, the workers downed tools with
great gusto, causing several yelps of pain
as some prominent bunions suffered in
the process. They crowded about the
speaker, ready to listen to whatever bilge
came flowing from above the cactus-like
beard.
“Comrades,” he said again, “now is
the time to make history. For long
enough have you been silent under the
big feet of the tyrant, accepting his many
curses and few piastres in a meek and
’umble spirit. Hinsult after hinsult has
been heaped upon you and, you poor
simps, you’ve stood for it. The king
lies there snoring like a pig while you
are slaving your lives away in—in agony
and much tr-r-ribulation.”
By this time he had begun to shout
enough to make the well-known welkin
ring heartily, and the commotion caused
Khafra to amble over to see what was
doing. A few in the crowd forth-
with tried to look as if they were
just idly surveying the Memphis
annual barge races down the Nile
or an Ancient Egyptians’ Reunion
rather than dodging work and soak-
ing in the words of a
leather-mouthed agitator;
but Khafra seemed rather
enthusiastic about the re-
marks of the orator as
he continued:
“There’s only one way
to fix this. All of you go
on strike and stand out
for more piastres and less
work. He’ll come across,
but if he’s still stubborn
you even might—excuse the pun, you
chaps—an-Nile-ate some of his family
and so bring the old Gizeh to his senses.”
(Loud laughter and cheers.) “Well, now,
whadya goin’ to do about it?”
Somebody sang out to put it to the
vote. They did, and a state of strike was
instantly declared. The orator’s voice
arose once again above the tumult.
“Right,. that’s good! Now some of
you wake the king and tell him. In the
meantime you might—er—take up a col-
lection for my expenses. It’s the usual
thing,” he concluded.
“Ho, is it?” struck in a raucous voice.
“Lemme tell you this—you did all the
talk, so you can tell ’is Nibs. And as for
a collection—well, there ain’t goin’ to be
none. That’s right, you fellows, isn’t
it?” he threw over his brawny shoulders
to his workmates.
“Sure,” they yelled.
The agitator scratched his beard, seek-
ing inspiration as to what would be the
correct thing to say in the circumstances.
By the time he’d thought of something
the crowd had dispersed revelling in their
self-obtained liberty. However, putting
another half-hitch in his girdle and his
faith in Osiris, he stamped over to the
king’s slumbering form, and without
pomp or ceremony kicked it in the ribs.
This had the effect of rousing the king.
He sat up, monarch of all he surveyed
—the scraggy agitator and the uncom-
pleted pyramid with its shadow, sundry
flies and a scarab. Of the laborers there
was no sign, but frenzied shouts and the
chink of coins proclaimed that' they were
playing two-up on the hidden side of
Khufu’s monument.
It took a deal of heated explanations,
gesticulations and what not on the part of
the strike-leader to give his Majesty the
good oil. However, when the glad news
had penetrated into his thick head, the
king uttered a weird croak, swiped wildly
with a fat fist, and sent the unfortunate
and talkative one into a blissful sleep by
means of a collision between the royal
fork-lifter and a stubbly chin.
Then the king scampered here and
there seeking his slave-driven subjects
until he came on them gambling away
their hard-earned piastres.
“To work, you scum, to work,” be
regally yelled. “You can’t defy me, by
Horus, and get away with it. Get up,
there!”
With sneers and smirks some hun-
dreds of sweaty faces turned away from
the king in scornful fashion and con-
tinued with their game. Signs of apoplexy
approached boiling point on the fat coun-
tenance of Khufu as he raged and
stamped, but to no avail. At last, lack
of breath and danger of dissolution
caused him to cease his vocal and danc-
ing efforts.
“All right, all right,” he said, every-
thing being all wrong, “I’ll fix you.
You’re all sacked, d’you hear? Fired. I’ll
get a gang from over the border to finish
the job and I’ll tax you to pay their
wages. Then see how you like it.”
With that Khufu slunk off, accelerated
in pace by a chunk of pyramid impacting
itself on his offside ear.
The king carried out his threat. Be-
fore much water had passed down the
dirty Nile an Ethiopian labor gang, at
double wages, was pitching and tossing
slabs of stone about.
An Egyptian unemployment committee
discussed affairs and came to the happy
conclusion to let the blighters work
Agitator (laughing heartily).
because they wouldn’t
get paid anyhow. Khufu
couldn’t get any more
taxes out of them ; if he
tried they’d poison his
rhubarb and bury him
darkly at dead of night
under his confounded
pyramid. Thus were the
seeds of revolution
sprouting fast.
Khufu sulked in his
palace glowering at the
rising sun, the setting sun,
and his useless human
son, who mooched about
giving vent to much
fatuous advice. Then
came a thunderbolt out of the far west
and drove the king almost distracted. A
courier, hotfoot from some forsaken
place, the name of which has been lost,
brought news of the queen’s imminent
arrival back in her happy home.
Like most wise men Khufu was afraid
of his wife, and so he thereupon pro-
nounced a state of emergency, and with
oily promises of increases in pay and free
admittance for all to the Karnak Cup
meeting, he got his old gang back again
to work. Overtime was the order of the
night in order to get the pyramid fin-
ished, and thus it came to pass that one
morning the monarch gazed at the stony
mass conscious of the fact that it was
now ready for the approval of his queen.
That very night, lighted torches an-
nounced the arrival of a royal caravan
bearing the dusky, pigeon-toed Queen of
Egypt within her gates. Khufu fell on
her neck and kissed her and fluttered
here and there, trying to get in the good
graces of his lady. He had inward
qualms as to the cleanliness of the
kitchen and living rooms, but noted that
the darkness hid many doubtful corners.
Next morning the king was up bright
and early, chasing the early worm, eat-
ing a hearty breakfast, and then eagerly
waiting for the queen to appear when he
would show her the pride of his heart,
the Pyramid.
She came, she ate, and she listened to
her lord and master whilst she used a
dexterous toothpick.
“Come on to the balcony, my dear,
and see a little surprise I have for you.
Remember, it’s all yours to do what you
like with.”
She tittered like a bird in spring. “You
always were a one, Goof. I’m quite ex-
cited to see what you’ve got for me.”
And out on to the wind-swept bal-
cony they went.
“There,” the king cried, “just a little
effort of mine, for you !”
The queen gazed for a space, the smile
left her face, and an angry glitter came
into her eyes.
“Idiot,” she yelled, “you’ve blocked up
the best view of the desert in Egypt.
Get it shifted —at once!”

Drama with the Stamp of Truth:-
THE RIGHT THING
BY
DOUGLAS DAVISON.
If he had run he would have
been safe, but he stood directly
in the big animal’s path. The
bull shambled the last few
steps. Willie went down back-
wards.
THE three middle wires were broken.
He had stood higher than the fence,
yet he had gone through without
breaking the top wire. He had stepped
over the bottom one. That was under-
standable. But why hadn’t he broken
the top strand?
Burnett loopfed the broken wire back
and spliced in a short piece with a figure-
eight knot. Clamping the claws of the
patent strainer to the two loose ends, he
worked the ratchet back and forth until
the wire tightened. Securing the ends,
he released the strainer.
There were two more broken wires to
strain. Burnett picked up s a loose end,
but stood looking at it as if he had for-
gotten what next to do.
THE fence had been broken three weeks
before.
It was near the end of the harvest. The
full bags stood huddled in groups diago-
nally from the paddock corner. He had
been driving his old-fashioned harvester,
whipping the tired horses, urged by the
blue-black clouds that were banking in
the west. Willie was late with his after-
noon-tea. The horses’ shadows had crept
from under their bellies and were danc-
ing long-legged on the stubble.
Then, as the horses had clumsily side-
stepped at the far turn, he had seen
young Willie leave the farmhouse carry-
ing the tea and a dilly-bag of cakes.
Where the water had lain in the hollow
the crop was of uneven height, and he
had been busy keeping the straw out of
the comb. He hadn’t seen the boy again
until he had driven the horses to the last
unwilling inch at the turn nearest the
house.
Willie was getting through the horse-
paddock fence. There would be time to
empty the drum, so he had spiked a bag
on the holder and pushed up the lever to
open the gate of the bin. The rush of
wheat had whispered into the empty bag.
A hot puff of wind had swirled the
chaff in the stubble. Down near the dam
a cow lowed. It was a sound that he
seldom consciously identified from the
other farm noises, but there was a hurt,
complaining note in it that made him
grin.
The cow lowed again, and Moriarty’s
bull answered. Short and sharp, and
then with a rumbling growl that had spun
Burnett around.
The bull had crashed through the
boundary fence. With his head out and
up until his nose was level with his rump
he was walking straight down to the
dam.
Willie stood looking at him. Whether
petrified or unafraid Burnett didn’t know.
If he had run he would have been safe,
but he stood directly in the big animal’s
path.
The bull shambled the last few steps.
Willie went down backwards. The bull
put his head on the ground as if about
to turn a somersault. After pushing the
bundle along a few feet he raised his
voice in challenge, and then continued on
his way to the dam.
BURNETT gave his pants an impatient
hitch to his waist, not noticing that
they dropped straight back to his hips
the moment he let them go. He threaded
the wire through the posthole and then
again stood dream-dazed.
At his back, to the right, was the
stubble paddock where he had been har-
vesting that day. Behind him was Willie.
Willie lying on his back with the bull
over him.
But that was three weeks ago! Willie
had been taken away. The paddock was
now empty and bare. As empty as the
farmhouse to his left where Annie’s
ghost moved about her household tasks.
Annie had never been able to spare
much of her meagre vitality for speech,
but since the bull had played with Willie
she had been almost dumb.
She had spoken this morning, though.
Standing in the doorway, looking up to
the horse paddock, she had said over her
shoulder,' “Now that the harvest is over
you will have time to mend the fence.”
Now that the harvest is over! A poor
sort of harvest it had been. Eight' bushels
to the acre after twenty years of married
life. That didn’t sound right! He was
getting mixed. Twenty years married,
and Willie was their only fruit. There
would be no more. And now the har-
vest' was over.
Above the swell of the hill he could
see the roof of Moriarty’s house.
Moriarty with his ten-foot-swathe header,
his painted homestead and litter of chil-
dren —barrel-chested and laughing like
their father.
He hated Moriarty. Had hated him
since schooldays. Moriarty had always
beaten him. The big, curly-headed boy
had an easy contempt for sneaky Willie
Burnett. There were others Burnett had
hated, but Moriarty had loomed biggest
because their way home from school had
been along the same lane. Moriarty
was always there, overshadowing him,
ridiculing his futility.
Burnett had lived in a dream world in
which he had been a conqueror, but in
reality he had always met defeat. He
had dreamt of himself as the hero of
glorious feats, but he had never tasted a
victory.
There had been other dreams, too.
Destroying dreams. There was that girl
who had stood up in class and stam-
mered, “Miss Prince, Willie Burnett keeps
looking at me,” and had burst out cry-
ing. He couldn’t even look at the girls,
but they giggled among themselves at
Moriarty’s bold advances.
When he married Annie there had been
snickers. People had said that the two
left-overs had taken each other because
no one else would.
He knew the things that were said of
him. Even the story about his uncle and
the farm. How his uncle’s son labored
on the roads as a maintenance man and
Willie had got the farm. And people
knew how he got it.
He hated them all for their know-
ledge, but' most of all he hated Moriarty.
He couldn’t revenge himself on them all,
but Moriarty was going to be the scape-
goat.
Did they think they could take his
Willie without paying? There were
courts and the law. Moriarty was going
to pay dearly for keeping a dangerous
bull without nosering or bar.
He and Moriarty would be the same
size when they stood in front of the
Judge. In fact, he would be the bigger
because he would be in the right and the
law would be on his side.
Savagely he hitched his trousers up and
then let them fall futilely back to his hips.
THE plaintiff. Counsel for the plaintiff.
The defendant. That made three.
There should be four. Was Moriarty so
sure of himself that he thought he had
no need of a lawyer? So much the worse
for him if he was. The victory would be
easier, but no less savory.
The court formalities were lost to
Burnett. He could see two riders, legs
cocked over pommels, yarning by the
roadside: “I see be the papers that
Willie Burnett won his action ’gainst
Moriarty. Shrewd chap, Willie. Must
know what he’s about.”
He woke with a start. Moriarty was
on his feet. His curly head was bowed
to one side, and his eyes were sad.
Moriarty started talking in a low tone,
but his voice gained strength as he went
on. He raised his head and uncon-
sciously addressed, not the Judge, nor yet
Burnett, but the farmers on the public
benches of the court.
“.... I have no wish to defend this
action what fault there was I admit
.... can make no real amends for the
loss of his son what I can do I will
if my neighbor will say how much,
I will pay it.”
Burnett listened, trying to comprehend
the meaning of what Moriarty was say-
ing. He had thought he would have to
fight, but Moriarty had accepted defeat
willingly. All he had to do was to stand
up and say how much the big man would
pay.
(How much are sons worth? How
much am I offered, ladies and gentle-
men? A little short-sighted and a bit
underweight, but remember he’s an only
son. Come now, ladies and gentlemen,
how much am I bid? . . . Damn you,
Moriarty, you’ve beaten me again. I’ve
got to get up now and claim my blood
money . . . How much are only sons
worth?)
His lawyer leaned over whispering, but
Burnett waved him away with a petu-
lant flip of his hand. He stood up, and
he, too, turned to the watching farmers.
He tried to sink his whining voice to
imitate Moriarty’s mellow tones.
“Mr. Moriarty hasn’t got enough
money to give me back my Willie. But
there are other boys in the district, and
that bull is still alive. If he will under-
take to destroy the bull I will withdraw
this action.”
Burnett sat down and looked, first at
the Judge for approval, and then at
Moriarty.
(Damn you, Moriarty, I beat you that
time!)
BURNETT paused as he harnessed his
horse at the back of Brownrigg and
Company’s store. Barry Fisher came out
of the back of the shop and walked to
where his saddled horse was feeding. See-
ing Burnett, he came across and shook
hands with him.
“I was terrible sorry to hear about
young Willie. It was terrible sad.” He
looked at the ground for a moment doing
honor to Burnett’s sorrow, then he bright-
ened up. “I was in court to-day. I
always thought you had Moriarty set.
Not but what you did what was right,
but I always thought you had him set.”
Burnett got into his buggy. He turned
to Fisher.
“Well, I don’t exactly like him, but
right’s right and wrong’s wrong, and you
know I’ve always tried to do what’s
right-”
Fisher watched Burnett drive out of
the yard, a puzzled look in his eyes,

My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
Country Development
PREPARATION of a programme had
been in hand ever since the com-
mencement of the recess, but had
been, as may be imagined, much inter-
rupted by psychological storms. From
this point onward we met virtually daily,
and the whole of the requirements of the
State, as we saw them, were passed under
a really searching review in the light of
such guidance as could be gathered from
the Labor platform.
Of these, the needs of settlement and
the handling of our public lands came
first.
Few things are more impenetrably mys-
terious to the uninitiated than the land
problems of an Australian State. There
seem to be millions of undeveloped acres
lying around in all directions, while no
one can get a scrap of it to settle on.
New South Wales has a total area
somewhat greater than France and Great
Britain put together. This area supports
less than two and a half million people ;
that is, a population of about eight to
the square mile, of which one half is
clustered around the capital.
Nevertheless, for years before our time,
every land ballot had been crowded with
competitive land-seekers, and there were
often as many as 300 or 400 applications
for each block made available by the
department. That this should be so is
difficult to explain fully, even after years
of experience. There are, however, two
or three points which may be mentioned
as throwing some light on the puzzle
before I go on to narrate the course we
now followed.
WESTERN
LANDS
It must be
borne in mind, to
begin with, that
one half of the
total area of the State is in the western
division and not suitable for closer settle-
ment. This is the traditional sheep coun-
try of Australia, a fertile soil under a
poor rainfall. Of the remaining eastern
portion, one half may be said to consist
of country either mountainous or not so
far made economically possible by rail-
ways and roads —particularly by railways.
Of the eligible quarter left, the greater
portion had already been parted with.
This was alienated originally in small
allotments, but most of these had been,
under various short-sighted land laws of
the past, gobbled up by the land mono-
polist.
We had thus arrived at a point, at the
beginning of this century when much of
the finest land of the State was concen-
trated into a few hundred large estates.
Our predecessors, the Wade Government,
had very courageously commenced the
policy of buying these back with the
object of subdividing and distributing
them under conditions which would pre-
vent their reamalgamation. This policy
had been given an experimental trial,
without entire success, but when we came
irf we knew of nothing better.
NEILSEN AT THE
LANDS
DEPARTMENT
Neilsen’s driv-
ing spirit had not
been at work in
the Lands De-
partment more
than a few weeks
before fresh lights began to break in
upon him.
The most tireless of men, he had not
only tackled the colossal task of dispos-
ing of the arrears which every incoming
Minister for the last 40 years had found
awaiting him, but while doing so was
evolving from his inner consciousness an
entirely new policy.
Having a mind which could see the
wood as well as the trees, he had dis-
covered that there were, to begin with,
considerable areas set aside under the
name of reserves which had ceased to
be of use, but which, being widely scat-
tered, had escaped the notice of succes-
sive Ministers. Large tracts in the in-
terior which, 20 years before, had been
Holman and McGowen going out to
do a little sod-turning.
all sheep country were now all wheat
country. Reserves and routes for travel-
ling stock were no longer necessary in
these regions, in which no stock was now
raised. Similarly, there were mining re-
serves on fields which were worked out,
and water reserves which experience had
proved held no water.
He went on to find that there was
much land leased out in comparatively
large holdings under a form of tenure
known as Improvement Leases which
could be resumed and subdivided into
settlement holdings, and in this and other
ways, by a more intense scrutiny than his
predecessors in the department had given,
he was able to show us a total of from
10,000,000 to 12,000,000 acres of avail-
able Crown land well suited for settle-
ment, much of it within easy distance of
existing railways.
A LAND-
SETTLEMENT
SCHEME
He the refare
proposed that the
resumption policy
should be for the
present laid aside.
His argument was
simple and conclusive.
“It will probably,” he said, “cost us
very much less to build any additional
railways needed to open up these
12,000,000 acres of Crown land than if
would to buy back from the squatters
12,000,000 acres of land or its equiva-
lent ; that is, a smaller area of better
quality which would give the same
number of holdings. But even if it cost
us as much, by acting along my lines
we shall get both additional railways and
the new areas of land. Acting on the
old policy we should be handing the
amount over bodily to the monopolist,
and we should have only the land for it.
In the one case, too, our money would
be spent on keeping a large body of
wage-earners, who will themselves spend
it in turn and increase the general pur-
chasing power of the community; in the
other we shall pay over to wealthy
people, many of whom will leave the
country with it or make investments
abroad.”
These considerations decided us to
follow Neilsen’s energetic lead, though
it involved an almost complete departure
from the conventional view which had
for some years prevailed almost' equally
on either t.ide of the House.

The Establishment
of the First Bank
The first advertisement of the Bank of New South Wales
appeared in the "Sydney Gazette" on 22nd February,
1817, as follows: —
"Bank of New South Wales—Wanted for this
establishment a suitable, strong, well-built house,
situate in or near George Street. Also two per-
sons of respectable character, who can give good
security for their fidelity, to fill the situation of
Cashier and Principal Accountant. Applications
to be made to the undersigned: The President of
the Board of Directors, J. T. CAMPBELL."
The Bank of New South Wales opened for business in
Mrs. Mary Reiby's house, Macquarie Place, Sydney, on
Bth April, 1817.
To-day this Bank has over 720 branches throughout Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and London, and
directly employs more than 4,000 officers to serve the
Bank's many thousands of customers.
The remarkable growth of this Bank reflects the public's
appreciation of the service it has rendered to the com-
munity and the confidence of the people in its adminis-
tration.
For 117 years the Bank has completely safeguarded the
interests of its depositors and provided all necessary
banking facilities for all sections of the people.

AN announcement' of a return to the
policy of settlement on Crown lands
evoked much derision from our critics,
and our best friends looked grave. Crown
lands had come to be synonymous with
mountain ridges or the distant west. On
the other hand, Neilsen was known as a
man of country upbringing, a bushman
and a wide traveller, and there were few
who were prepared to challenge his ex-
plicit statements on a definite question
of fact.
Our opponents took it ill that we
should enter upon a scheme which sug-
gested that they had failed to appreciate
the fine assets which we now flourish-
ingly asserted we had found. It was
difficult to put such claims forward with-
out reflecting to some extent upon our
predecessors’ diligence. Nothing, how-
ever, was further from our thoughts.
Moore, the late Minister, was universally
admired, and we proved our feelings
towards him in a practical fashion shortly
after this by appointing him to a vacant
post on the Western Lands Commission,
which he was peculiarly qualified to fill.
This appointment was made on Neilsen’s
proposal, and, I am glad to think, unani-
mously adopted by the Cabinet.
Development by
new railways be-
came the next
essential. Neilsen
RAILWAY
EXPANSION
indicated certain lines which he needed,
and, although other lines not directly
connected- with this' scheme were gone on
with at the same time, we did, then and
there, achieve to some degree that com-
bination-between railway and land poli-
cies which- to-day everyone admits to be
essential, but which, so far as I know,
was - then ' first effected. Later on we
made further and greater efforts in this
direction, as I' shall describe in its place.
The loans becoming heavy.
At this point, too, we had to determine
our attitude as to the North Coast rail-
way. This was an expensive work which
had been forced on by the Carruthers
Government. It's aim was to unite Syd-
ney with the Queensland border by a
line running parallel with the coast and
hardly anywhere more than fifty miles
from it. One section had been com-
pleted and two others commenced. It
was quite possible for us to finish these
three sections and abandon the rest of
the scheme.
IN view of the comparative ease with
which the region concerned could get
into touch with coastal shipping and the
urgent necessity for many railway works
in the interior, we had some years earlier
strongly opposed the proposal. We
shrank, however, from following up that
opposition now.
The passage of the Act, we thought,
must be interpreted as a Parliamentary
promise to the districts concerned. New
settlement was
occurring in the
North Coast dis-
tricts on the
strength of its
prospective rail-
way. We de-
cided, possibly
with a little too
much regard for
fair dealing, to
burden ourselves
with the respon-
sibility of carry-
ing this line to
completion.
This decision
considerably in-
creased the
range and cost
of our works
policy. Fully
half a million a
year out of our
Wade, accepting an ex-
planation from the
other side.
limited loan funds was spent upon it,
and, as we had bound ourselves to take
up, in addition, the wheat-land railways
of the interior which we had always
urged, it will be seen that we had a
double load to carry.
Further, we were now actually starting
on the duplication of the main lines,
which our predecessors had only talked
about, and thus our works expenditure
showed almost from the first day an
enormous increase over theirs. This was
naturally attributed by the more saga-
cious of our critics to the congenital
recklessness of a Labor Government.
Country de-
velopment during
the previous 10
years had led to a
SYDNEY’S
NEEDS
corresponding growth of the city, which
nothing had been done to meet.
Sydney had been “swelling visibly,”
and its transport requirements were far
beyond the possibilities of an antiquated
system of street-cars. All the suburban
lines branched out of one or two main
city lines, and when the business world
was going in to or returning from the city
the cars were practically touching one
another on this portion of the system.
Nothing could be done without additional
ways.
Why, it may be asked, should the Gov-
ernment have to concern itself about this
purely municipal difficulty? Why not
hand it over to a County Council?—
clearly indicated as a possible remedy.
But local prejudices were bitter and
strongly entrenched ; to create a general
council would be one of the crankiest
bits of legislative steering before us, and
probably take many years (it has not, as
a matter of fact, been done yet), and in
the meantime the crisis was rushing to-
wards us. The tramway management,
supported by the Railway Commis-
sioners, was quite convinced that within
a few years the traffic of Sydney would
be past handling. It insisted that
relief in some fashion must be secured
at once.
The idea of sub-
terranean ways
naturally sug-
gested itself.
THE
UNDERGROUND
The engineers of the Railway Depart-
ment, consulted on the question, pro-
posed what is known as a cut-and-cover
tunnel down George-street. By this is to
be understood the opening of a deep> cut-
ting in the main street through which the
new line was ultimately to run, and its
roofing over with a solid roadway des-
tined to carry the ordinary vehicular
traffic or even, if so desired, a second set
of trams on the original level.
Such a scheme wotild ease things toi
the next 10 to 15 years. Its cost, how-
ever, would reach appalling figures, upon
which we did not feel like embarking toi
the sake of a merely temporary relief.
We resolved, forthwith, that any step
now taken should be a contribution to-
wards a permanent solution —so far as
that adjective could apply to any arrange-
ment in a city of such rapid change. It
we were to go underground we must 01-
ganise a scheme analogous to the London
tubes or the subways of Paris and New
York. The practical problem was: Could
we at once put down some such subway
as would relieve the existing street-cai
traffic in our main thoroughfare and also
be a portion of a plan embracing the
whole city?
TO this question we received reassuring
answers from some of our engineers.
The best answer we received, however,
was the recommendation to call in Sn*
John Hay, a well-known British* expert.
Sir John had had much to do with the
London underground system, and it was
felt that he could guide us, as probably
no other man could, in a scheme or
revolutionising our transit conveniences
piece by piece without flabbergasting the
business of the city by any of the amateur
schemes so far before us. The Agent-
General was instructed to make the
necessary arrangements for a visit.
In all this, it will be realised, we were
traversing unknown country. These
purely administrative difficulties had not

LIFE
AND HEALTH CHARTS
In average life, health is best
between 20 and 40. The
“turning point” or noticeable
downward slope begins, as a
rule, at the age of 40. With
care (especially of the kidneys
and bladder) this health line
can be extended, so that its
steepness does not become pro-
nounced until 50 or even later.
The life-line, too, may now be
extended; 5, 10— or more-
years of healthy, active life
being gained by timely atten-
tion to the symptoms of disorder.
Why Age 40
is often the turning point in health
guard Yourself against these insidious After-40
Aliments that attack about 65 in every 100 men and i omen
ACCORDING to averages, you and I will
A die at fifty-five—or very near to that
A age . Had we been born in 1850, we
would have died at about thirty-five again,
according to the Law of Averages. So, you
see, Life is being lengthened. In a hundred
years’ time the average age at death will prob-
ably be seventy—maybe older. Look at the
charts above. Notice the Life-and-Health-
lines. You will see that the turning point
comes at about 40 years of age—that is the
age when the strain of life generally begins to
tell. At about 40, the seldom-mentioned
disorder —prostate trouble —begins to cheat
men of virility; while kidney and bladder
break-down afflicts about 65 men and women
in every 100—though some may never know it!
Medical science now declares that 75% of
poisonous wastes and uric acid deposits from
the system is excreted by the kidneys—in much
too-concentrated a form. The delicate over-
burdened kidney cells
are unequal to the
excessive strain. Con-
gestion occurs, forc-
ing back into the
system the poisons
which should be ex-
pelled. Here begins
a succession of ills;
here is where health starts to decline threaten-
ingly. Crippling backache begins; pains down
the groins; swollen joints, limbs and feet,
dizziness; possibly severe inflammation of the
bladder and urinary tract; rheumatism, which,
in turn, may seriously affect the heart.
How to Prevent and Banish These
Menacing “After-40” Disorders.
First strengthen your kidneys and enable them
to cope with their work. For this purpose
there is no proprietary remedy to equal the
preparation offered under authority of Dr.
William Harrison, Member of the Royal
College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the
Royal College of Physicians; distinguished in
London medical practice. This remedy,
widely known as Harrison’s Pills, is com-
pounded to what is probably the most perfect
prescription for overcoming the cause of the
majority of old-age symptoms ever discovered.
Make Your Life and Health Lines
Curve More Gradually.
Though the average person dies at about 55,
there is no good reason why you should —if
you take special precautions.
Keep your kidneys in perfect health and
eliminate the harmful poisonous wastes as they
are formed —by taking Harrison’s Pills. If
you decide to take this remedy, prepare to
see some surprising changes in your health.
Notice the departure of constipation (in itself
a dread disorder) ; notice an improvement in
the clearness of your eyes and skin, and m
the lines around your eyes. Feel yourself
become a good ten years younger as
Harrison’s Pills drive out the symptoms of
increasing age; bid farewell to your growing
sense of weariness and to your constantly re-
curring aches and pains. See your step take
on new elasticity; hear your friends remark at
the improvement in your general spirits and
bearing. Continue with this remedy, taking a
couple of the pills whenever there are indica-
tions of strain upon the kidneys, or signs of
bladder, uric acid or urinary trouble. Then
you may feel safe in the assumption that you
are taking effective steps to straighten out that
declining “life-line,” prolonging useful vigorous
activity, five, ten —even twenty years, and in
these added years of life, who knows what
marvels of rejuvenation science may devise?
Harrison's Pills are obtainable from all high-
class prescription chemists in bottles of 1&
pills, 2/-; 32 pills, 3/-; and 68 pills, 5/-. If
remote from a chemist, post your. order to
Amalgamated Laboratories, Australia House*
Sydney. Satisfaction or refund of purchase
price is guaranteed with the very first bottle*
