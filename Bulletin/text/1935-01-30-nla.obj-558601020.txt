The Week's Best:—
THE RENAISSANCE
ON PARADE
It is five years
since Francis
Hackett became
the literary father
of Henry VIII.; now he has produced
what looks dike a French twin in Francis
the First (Heinemann; 12s, 6d.).
It was inevitable that Mr. Hackett
should some time illuminate the life of
Francis, who was Henry’s contemporary.
Born three years after England’s pride-
ful monarch, he lived just long enough
to see him perish. The fate of each was
wrapped up with that of the other. ■ It
was the red beard of Francis which in-
spired Henry to cultivate his own golden
Mr. Hackett is a U.S.A.-trained
journalist who has read Guedalla, Froude
and Lytton Strachey, and who has been
shrewd enough to discover that these lack
an essential in writing for an age which
has been brought up on the Hollywood
movies. He himself keeps one eye on
Douglas Fairbanks and another on the
little Lolitas of Los Angeles whose
dimples and smiles bring them out of
sculleries and lead the Sauls among
super-producers to clothe them in the
scarlet and other delights in which one
plays the role of a king’s mistress. If
Charles Laughton should decide to put
Mr. Hackett’s Francis on the screen, he
scarcely need even buy a new costume
or conceive a new technique. Those
which he used for Henry will do admir-
ably, and wigs will change his Anne
Boleyn into Anne de Heilly and his
Catherine Howard into any other lady
who comes first in the cast, so long as
she is not a wife.
Wives, in Mr. Hackeft’s biographies,
must in no circumstances have attrac-
tion. All mistresses are beautiful. And
the background in which they move must
be modern and garish enough to stimu-
late the intelligences of the large section
of humanity which can sit entralled
before such films as “Hollywood on
Parade.”
Mr. Hackett is not a historian. His
facts often are not backed by any quoted
authorities or bibliography that is worth
a rap. He has read all the spicy
chroniclers who infested the sixteenth
century. He knows every libel which
was born of the continual wars of the
Renaissance aqd of the religious conflicts
which surged round Luther and Calvin
and Loyola. Ergo, he can repeat verbatim
conversations which took place between
the King and the King’s mistress, and he
is able to tell us details usually concealed
behind lavatory doors or which emerge
only into daylight as fiction under the
hands of Boccaccios. He is a most credu-
lous person—he even seems to believe
Benvenuto Cellini. He puts his faith in
rondeaus as sober evidence.
To him Francis was a colorful, naughty
figure, a libidinous devil of a man in-
vented by Providence for a Hollywood
biographer to hang scandal and sex
appeal on. In battle he was another
Bayard. When he wins Lis victory over
the Swiss and the Papal forces at
Marignano on September 15, 1515, his
chronicler can scarce take his eyes from
him. Actually, it was the Piedmontese
peasant who found the secret pass across
the Alps who deserved most credit. If
Francis had not, through this guidance,
completely surprised Colonna, so that the
latter was captured without a blow, the
tale would have been far different. And
it has always been a moot point whether
Francis would have won his battle if
Alviano with his Venetian forces had not
arrived when both sides were spent and
Francis’s adversaries, if anything, in the
ascendant. Equally, the young King, in
Mr. Hackett’s Gaelic imagination, was
a heroic figure at Pavia, where he was
captured by the Emperor’s forces keep-
ing off hordes of landknechts and other
redoubtables, but surviving without a
scratch, though virtually every other
leader of importance in his army lost his
life or limped off the field marked for
death, like Alengon.
However, Mr. Hackett is not quite
easy with Francis in war or in diplo-
macy unless the trappings are worth
photographing, as on the Field of the
Cloth of Gold. He prefers him among
his women, where he can hang little
strings of titillating, sex-appeally adjec-
tives on his actions and those of his asso-
ciates and relatives. He has studied
Montluc of the Commentaries and Du
Bellay of the Memoires historiques to
some purpose; but he is evidently not
so familiar with, or interested in, the
copious documentation of the age left
by the British State and Imperial Paper
offices, Giustiniani, Bennet, Peter
Vannes, D’lnteville, Campeggio and
others.
The story of how the picturesque Bon-
nivet climbed through a trapdoor in the
floor so that Marguerite of Angouleme,
the King’s sister, discovered him (in a
scented nightshirt), importunate and with
his arms round her, appeals to him. He
toys with the idea that Marguerite, who
/vas the shelter of all religious moderates
and Calvinists, the reputed authoress of
the Heptameron and the protector of
Rabelais, was guilty of incest with her
brother, against whom even worse per-
versions are hinted.
Much was possible in an age in which
popes escaped from their sacked cities
disguised as hucksters, and kings, im-
mured in dungeons, sought to flit stove-
piped as blackamoors. It is easy to be
credulous about a period in which, the
son of the King of France dying after
a cool drink, the giver of the drink could
be torn apart by wild horses just in
case he might have been a poisoner. And
when one hears of barons sawing their
captives in halves d la Turc, and of a
queen having her young daughter flogged
to make her marry, and of a cardinal be-
ing strangled in his cell for suborning
somebody to put poison in the Holy
Father’s fistula, nothing contemporary
can astonish. All the same, less excitable
historians absolve Marguerite from most
of the calumnies alleged against her, and
acknowledge her broadmindness, virtue
and disinterested devotion to her family
and friends.
Hackett, Hollywooden Historian.
History—as Opposed to Mr. Hackett —
discounts the mistresses of Francis, since
even cardinals were not above keeping
a couple, and with kings they were
taken for granted even in sober Eng-
land till the time of George the Fourth.
It is apt rather to lay stress on the im-
portance of the age than on its pecca-
dilloes.
If Francis was a philanderer, he at
least-changed the barbaric manners of
his Court for a new refinement. He was
the patron of Leonardo da Vinci and of
Cellini, as his sister was of Donet,
Desperiers and Marot, and the founder
of the College of France. The palaces of
Amboise, Chambord and Fontainebleau
were his monuments as the father of the
ancien regime. If he lost battles in stu-
pid wars of ambition, his was an age of
confusion in which almost every monarch
did the same. Within France he never
lost his hold, even when captured by a
foreign enemy. He stripped the parle-
ments of their independent power, hanged
those who got in his way and generally
set history on a new course, which had
its culmination in the Revolution over
250 years later.
That Mr. Hackett is too preoccupied
with his love affairs and naughtiness, and
with the petty horrors of the reign, which
he recognises as good pabulum for a
movie audience, does not make his book
unattractive. It is good reading. His
style is so graceful and opulent and his
diction at times so beautiful as to bind
glamor to even the worst habits of his
heroes and heroines. It is scarcely pos-
sible to dislike anybody in the book, so
gaily and insouciantly wicked are they
all.
Unless, of course, it i s the wives.
They, plain, ordinary women, sometimes
with squints, look on canvas very much
like the mistresses—-the sixteenth cen-
tury was prolific in portraiture—but in
Hackett the fact that they confined them-
selves to the task of producing a new
pledge to their lords every year nlakes
them poor material for romance.

Women
and
Literature
Tyll Owlglass,
“Women, Novels
and Libraries”
(R.P. 12/12/’34),
has particularised
what I have long
thought about women in general. Is one
to believe with H. G. Wells that they have
not the staying power to produce a great
creative work, or is one to fall back upon
the old biological excuse that nature is
all against such a happening?
Twenty years ago feminists shrieked
that men were to blame for women’s
shortcomings. That excuse is no longer
valid. I doubt if men ever were to blame.
The truth is that women are intellectually
lazy. The cheap novel is a godsend to
them, both in writing and reading, be-
cause most women are subjective, and
all women dramatise themselves. Emo-
tionally they are savages. The news-
papers and publishers of novels and
women’s magazines recognise this. Hence
the wholesale prostration of women be-
fore these female publications. The
Home, Motherhood and Virtue are the
three booming notes struck upon the tom-
tom. Indeed, the mush poured out about
motherhood during the last few years has
absolutely dazzled the majority of women
into believing that in producing a child
they have completed a life work. Yet
the truthful woman will confess that a
sensibly-brought-up child does not fulfil
all her needs. Even in this woman has
had to be taught her job. It is not too

far-reaching to say that the majority of
mothers make a shameful hash of
their motherhood, and in a wise State
would be compelled to feed and train
their children sensibly or give them up.
Even the cheapest publication now-
adays has articles on child psychology and
feeding, yet the average woman is as
ignorant of the subject as her grand-
mother was. She has had charge of the
kitchen and the cradle for thousands of
years, but, being mentally incurious, she
has never experimented, and has had to
wait until man instructed her in what she
should have made an exact science.
Poets have always sung of women as
lovely abstract things, which is ludicrous.
Women despise the abstract. They are
purely concrete. That is why they do
not create greatly; anything that they
cannot feel or touch is useless. All
women have a cleverness infinitely
superior to men, but that is as far as it
goes. They can understand cleverness in
a woman; beyond that they are sus-
picious.
To be a Shakspeare or a Goethe or a
Dostpieffsky needs a deep, a brooding
understanding of life, a vast and intensive
spiritual experience encompassing the
realities and the abstract, totally dissoci-
ated from the coloring of personal
emotions. What woman has ever been
able to dissociate herself from the narrow
scene in which she is part? Her value
rests on her moral worth or the appear-
ance of it. She might have the finest
brain, the keenest desire for the freedom
allowed the male. She can neglect that
brain, let it rot, cheapen it, do what she
likes with it. No one will object. Yet
let her step outside the morality that
custom says the charwoman and the
female genius must obey and she is an
outcast. She might think like a Shak-
speare, and yet she must live like the
“little woman” next door. If she persists
in her freedom, unless some man will
keep her, she faces economic ruin.
Take, for instance, two women and
two men in similar situations. The two
men are joined by a third, say a poet
or writer, anything to do with creative
work. Perhaps his private life is not too
pleasant; perhaps he gets drunk, has love
affairs; the other two are respectable.
The three talk together impersonally.
The same thing happens to the two
women, only the poet or the writer enter-
ing is a woman. What happens? Up go
the noses, out comes the disapproval:
“My dear, you simply can't know her.
Disgusting creature,” etc.
A woman is judged by her powers of
sexual restraint and nothing; else. A
curious state of affairs that women
should place such keen value upon that
which keeps them where they are to-day,
and will keep them there until Kingdom
Come, or until they realise that the head
is vitally more important.
One can blame the social system, which
makes the man-hunt so important, or
our system of education, the inadequacy
of which is notorious. Still, women have
had long enough in which to do some-
thing about these things.
But, being what she is, woman’s
emotions must be continuously titillated.
Eighty per cent, of women, married or
otherwise, live lives of complete sexual
frustration. There must be an outlet
somewhere ; hence the gruel dished up
by the publishers. As I remarked before,
women are subjective and given to
dramatisation. This drivel provides them
with an emotional outlet. Love is not
like that; life isn’t like that. What of it?
Think of the syrup every female swallows
from the time she knows she is different
from a little boy to the day she marches
to the altar and after. The realities of
life tear the veils away, but she won’t
see, she will not believe. The wurlitzers
of literature are there to comfort her, to
feed her starved emotions.
Education to women isn’t any use
under a social and economic system that
makes them dependent upon men. As
long as the system goes on their values
will be sexual, and the chief appeal of
literature to them will lie in sexcitement.

Ashes, Hobbs
and Fenders
Good Days: A
Book of Cricket,
by Neville Car-
dus ; The Fight
for the Ashes, by
Jack Hobbs; and
Kissing the Rod, by P. G. H. Fender,
form an interesting trilogy of books con-
cerning the 1934 tour.
Cardus is a graceful and charming
essayist. Some cricketers certainly enjoy
him, but it is a moot point whether he is
not a writer for litterateurs rather than for
cricketers. He overloads a book dealing
with a sport with similes and comparisons
drawn from literature, art, music.
Cricket enthusiasts are mostly simple
folk ; the majority of them might prefer
a simpler fare. For instance, Spooner, of
Lancashire, is remembered as a graceful
stylist. To Cardus his batting was “kin
with sweet music, and the wind that
makes long grasses wave, and the singing
of Elizabeth Schumann in Johann
Strauss, and the poetry of Herrick.” It
would leave the average barracker cold —
to which Cardus might reply that he was
not writing for the average barracker.
Cardus has broken the silence of four
years with Good Days, which he has
divided into three parts: first, a series of
character sketches of famous players;
next, a collection of essays expressing the
spirit and humor of cricket; lastly, a de-
scription of the Tests of 1934. The essays
and sketches in treatment and technique
form a continuation of his two previous
books, Days in the Sun and The Summer
Game. Three favorites reappear in
Macartney, Woolley and Gunn ; Jardine,
Bradman and Constantine are among the
new ones.
The character sketch of Archie Mac-
Laren, “the Noblest Roman,” is a par-
ticularly happy effort. Old Jolyon For-
syte at Lord’s is a clever fantasy, but
Cardus makes a curious error. Jolyon
sees “C. L. Townsend bowling left-arm
slows, a tall, thin boy fresh from school.”
Townsend was a slow right-arm bowler
who batted left-hand.
In the essay “Measure for Measure”
Cardus deals with bodyline. He would
have been well advised had he consulted
Hobbs before penning it.
The Test-match descriptions are full
of life and color, though few Australians
will share his early viewpoint concerning
O’Reilly’s labored methods. He makes
amends to William by the fifth Test
match —in fact, a deal of the charm of
Cardus rests in his generous apprecia-
tion of cricket merit, be it supplied by
friend or foe,
Hobbs’s book contains a complete
record of every match played in the 1934
series, together with stroke diagrams of
most of the important innings of indi-
vidual players. These diagrams are the
work of W. Ferguson, doyen of scorers
and bagmen.
The Fight for the Ashes is typical
of its author. Clear, concise criticism,
redolent of experience. The thrust at the
pro-bodyliners is hard to parry. Says
Hobbs: “Right through the tour I came
across that confused thinking on body-
line which is characteristic of all people
who did not see it bowled on our last
visit to Australia. Only those who saw
Larwood and Voce in action then have
any idea of what is meant by bodyline.”
The most interesting features of
Fender’s book are the illustrations and
statistical summaries. The general view
of the first Test at Nottingham facing
page 16 is a glorious piece of photo-
graphy ; in fact, every illustration is good.
Fender’s criticisms have, naturally, an
English bias. For instance, in the second
Test Wall had Hendren caught in the
slips by McCabe. Says Fender; “I feel,
knowing the facts, that he was a little
lucky in the manner in which he got his
wicket, for it was more on account of
the batsman playing too well than any-
thing else that he got it.” A naive
explanation, surely, but typical of many
used to exculpate England’s failure to
hold the Ashes.
The criticism of Bradman’s early
efforts is scathing. Possibly Fender
has not forgotten the joke Bradman put
over in 1930, when Fender predicted that
Don would not prove a success in Eng-
land. Don’s reply was to belt the Surrey
bowling, under Fender’s captaincy, to
the four winds of heaven.
Ponsford in the fifth Test is debited
by Fender with six chances. Cardus
maintains that “Penny” gave no more
than “two palpable chances,” and whips
in a googly by stating that “the slash
through the slips at 68 was of the swift
order that Mr. Fender can catch now that
he is in the press-box with an even
greater ease and celerity than he exhibited
when he was fielding for Surrey in his
best years.”
It will be news to many that the word
“bodyline” was first accredited to War-
wick Armstrong, who had control of
Gregory and McDonald in 1921. But
the opinions of Fender on this question
are discounted by his own statement that
“he was not in Australia in 1932-33, so
could not speak with authority on that
tour.”
Kissing the Rod hardly compares with
its author’s former book, The Turning
of the Wheel, and I am of opinion that
enthusiasts will prefer Jardine’s explicit
summarisation to Fender’s verbosity.
Nevertheless, the book should appeal to
students for its perfection of detail.

A Satchel of Books
Jobs for Jane, by Richard Dark.
Another of those amusing little mock-
serious books for which 1066 and All
That set the vogue. Jane is given
thorough advice on all branches of the
teaching profession, and is offered alter-
native outlets for her genius in ( inter alia )
Parliament, Nanny-Craft, Angoras, Bees
and Vegetables. Illustrations are by Der-
rick. (Basil Blackwell; 4s. 6d. net.)
Novels of over 600 pages are intimi-
dating, but Neil Bell’s latest is worth the
effort to face such things. In craftsman-
ship alone Winding Road (Collins ; 7s.
6d.) is a fine novel. It has breadth,
variety, a great range of characters and
environments; the writing is smooth,
easy, natural, with no straining after
effect. A thoroughly fine novel.
The Australian Gardener, by Leslie H.
Brunning (Robertson and Mullens; 7s.
6d.), is concisely written to suit Austra-
lian conditions ; its 560 pages and 230
illustrations make the as-good-as-perfect
guide-book.
Mr. Jorkens Remembers Africa, by
Lord Dunsany (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.).
Brief yarns, only one or two of which
touch on Africa. Jorkens is a re-
turned traveller whose stories in the
club smoking-room have earned him the
reputation of a super-Munchausen. Dun-
sany, as his Boswell, professes to believe
the stories, most of which deal with
strange folk and stranger happenings. In
many of them Dunsany excels in the
literary shorthand which is his special
metier, omitting facts and substituting
pale outlines for the reader to fill in him-
self. The method is extraordinarily suc-
cessful in “The Curse of the Witch,”
which deals with demoniac possession.
There are other yarns with an occult
flavor, and some in a lighter vein. All
eminently readable.
The Rhymer
from the
Mines
Melbourne
dailies that run a
highbrow section,
weeklies that
claim to be the
high priests of
the cult, lecturers who talk about
literature and old furniture when-
ever they find an opening, culture
orgiasts and intellectual addicts, not to
mention all the little organisations of
preciosity that encumber Melbourne,
have made a welter of it lately, raking
up everything possible about Australian
authors, particularly Victorian authors.
Not one of them has mentioned the
name of a Melbourne poet who died
only a year or two ago, and whose out-
put was probably the largest of any Aus-
tralian, and whose merit was far ahead of
scores of the society rhymsters and long-
haired free versifiers who have been held
up as Footscray Miltons and Colling-
wood Kiplings.
I refer to Edward Dyson, author of
Rhymes from the Mines and a few hun-
dred other verses, every one of which
gladdened the reader when it first ap-
peared in newspaper columns or book
form.
Why has Dyson been forgotten? It is
not that his stuff is out of date. He
occupied a middle period between the
present-day Australia and the times when
bushrangers roamed. If he wasn’t a con-
temporary of the roaring days of Ben-
digo and Ballarat rushes, he spent his
boyhood in the latter district when allu-
vial mining was still going strong, and
he saw the genesis, or almost the genesis,
of the deep quartz reefing. He lived the
life as a whim boy, and, even if the high-
brows should kick at his lack of Latin
and Greek and his paucity of classical
allusions, he gave a true picture of his
period, a picture as true as S. T. Gill
gave of the earlier period in his water-
color drawings.
It was not only in his verse that he
did this. His short story “Golden
Shanty” stands as a classic of goldfields
humor, and has the merit of being true
in its basis —built on an actual happen-
ing in the Castlemaine district in the
’seventies.
Dyson gave up mining shortly after
he reached manhood and took a job in
a Melbourne factory. His experiences
there he turned into the riotous humor
of Fact’ry ’Ands. It was comedy of
an extreme type, but it was true, for
Dyson possessed the art of conveying
fact in his atmosphere, however bizarre,
however extravagant, his plot and hand-
ling might be.
Of all the freelance journalists in the
Commonwealth, Dyson was the only one
who made a decent living at it His in-
dustry was tremendous ; it amounted to
an obsession. He worked all day, eight
hours, for six days a week, scorning a
typewriter until the last few years of
his life. He worked that way for more
than 25 years. He would start the day
on, say, a political article. As he laid
down the last slip he would commence
a piece of topical verse. That finished, he
would pen a short story of two or three
columns. Having signed that, he woukl.
write out an idea for a cartoon and a
couple of joke-blocks, to finish the day
with a dozen or 20 paragraphs about
politics, personalities, drama, sport or
anything else that came into his mind.
Between times he would reconstruct
melodramas or write additional verses for
theatrical managers or turn out booklets
for industrial magnates. He wrote for
half a dozen papers, and never missed
an issue with any of them. He was a
human dynamo of an aggravated type.
Yet his work did not suffer —the work
he felt was worthy of care, the work he
signed with his name. Dyson signed
only a proportion of his literary output ;
he had more aliases than any man in
Pentridge—“Silas Snell” was the name
under which he made his debut, and his
Fact’ry ’Ands first appeared as having
been written by “Mark Pope.”
Will Dyson the cartoonist, now in
London, is a younger brother who owes
much to the tutoring of the dead poet.

NEW STATES INSUFFICIENT.
Mr. H. S. Nicholas, the second N.S.W.
Royal Commissioner to go into the ques-
tion of cutting up N. S. Wales, has re-
ported that two parts of it are “suitable
for self-government as States.” One is in
the north —the coastal area from south of
Newcastle to the Queensland border, in-
cluding New England and the country to
40 miles beyond Brewarrina. The other
would include all central N.S.W. not in
the northern State, and nearly the whole
of the west. It would have no seaboard
—its eastern boundary would run from
the Victorian border below Bombala to
Rylstone. Mr. Nicholas suggests a
referendum in each of these areas, the
northern referendum to come first.
There would remain Sydney and a
strip extending north to below Newcastle
and south to the Victorian border. Ex-
cept Chile, it would, for its area, have the
longest coastline in the world. It would
look like a large worm with a red head,
consisting of a smudge of Sydney roofs.
But appearances on the map are no-
thing ; and it was a fixed idea of The
Bulletin’s James Edmond that Sydney
should be formed into a city-State.
The Australian Constitution was
framed with one eye on the U.S.A., but
sections were introduced which made it
difficult for communities to secure local
self-government. So, after 35 years, nearly
five-sixths of the population (6,630,000) is
concentrated in three States: N.S.W.,
2,601,000; Victoria, 1,820,000 and
Queensland, 947,000. In U.S.A. in a
half-century there have been numerous
subdivisions. Montana became a State
in 1889 with a population of 130,000 ;
Wyoming’s 60,000 people secured a Legis-
lature in 1890 ; Nevada had only 45,761
a quarter of a century after it attained
Statehood. North Dakota, South Dakota,
Washingon, Idaho, Oklahoma, Arizona
and New Mexico all have been admitted
since 1889. In Australia we retain
boundaries which, as Mr. Nicholas says,
were “the result of historical accident.”
Mr. Nicholas does not say what type of
State he favors, but new States admitted
under the Constitution as it stands (and
whether they can be is doubtful) would,
of course, have the same powers as exist-
ing States, and the same rights, including
the right—already freely exercised—to go
bung. They could laugh at Section 92
(“Trade, commerce and intercourse
among the States.... shall be absolutely
free”) as N.S.W. and Victoria are doing.
They could stop motor-lorries and hire-
cars coming in from those States and
one another, and tax income drawn by
their citizens from other parts of the
Commonwealth.
And they would, of course, set up
more Education Departments with Minis-
ters (there are six Education Ministers al-
ready), more Lands, Transport, Health
and Works Departments, more Law and
Labor Departments, perhaps more Local
Government Departments. And there
would necessarily be more politicians,
though Australia has 679 already and
finds the burden well-nigh insupportable.
And, since the present lopsided arrange-
ment of functions makes it practically
impossible for States to pay their way, the
new States would before long be com-
peting briskly for Commonwealth
largesse with South Australia, Westralia
and Tasmania, whose Governments—
though Canberra is giving them far more
than their tax-revenue in grants, boun-
ties, road subventions, interest and sink-
ing-fund allowances and distributions
from its last surplus—are all dissatisfied
and have budgeted for large deficits.
It is not a prospect that appeals. New
States will come, for local self-government
cannot for ever be refused to large, virile
communities demanding it; but a com-
plete separation of Commonwealth and
State powers and spheres of taxation, and
a new and equitable division of duties
such as will enable every State to do its
job and pay its way without clashing with
any other State or with the Common-
wealth—that must come first. Also,
Sydney must not be left at the mercy
of Langsters ; the Commonwealth must
have unchallengeable power to nullify
predatory legislation, as well as to admit
dissatisfied sections as States. It all
means a Commonwealth constitutional-
reform referendum, and though the
politicians don’t want one the people of
New England and the Riverina could
force it on them.
THE KNEE-ACTION MINISTRY.
“This Government has no knees,” said
the late Tom Bent when an appeal was
made to him as Premier of Victoria to
modify a policy he had laid down. The
present Victorian Ministry appears, on
the contrary, to be fitted with the latest
knee-action. It would not be correct to
say “knee-wheels,” for the existence of
wheels implies certain progress of which
the Argyle Ministry has revealed no indi-
cation. Mr. Hogan, who preceded Dr.
Argyle, contrived to infuse some vigor
into the conduct of Victorian affairs,
and kept the public awake, if he did no-
thing more. Dr. Argyle lets sleeping
electors lie.
Victoria has had 31 Parliaments,
and, judged on its record, the 31st,
though blamelessly respectable in person-
nel, was the worst. It was all promise
and no performance. The Argyles gave
an exhibition of the policy of go-slow
which would have won the heart of the
I.W.W. if it had lingered on the Vic-
torian scene. The opposition of Mr. Tunne-
cliffe has been the sort of vicious fight-
ing to be found at a chess championship.
Having concluded their first session with
a glorious record of non-achievement,
the Argyles entered upon the second
session determined to do better still. If
it were mathematically possible to sub-
tract something from nothing, they
would have beaten their earlier record.
As it was they equalled it. When
a Minister confessed to being a
Fascist “without a shirt,” people long-
ing for the dramatic expected some-
thing spectacular at last, but they were
disappointed. Life for the Argyles
remained a succession of placid Sundays.
In the way of action the only thing
they attempted was the crippling of
motor competition with the Govern-
ment railways, on which, as a com-
parison of timetables has shown, coun-
try trains still run at the dizzy speed
achieved 60 years ago. Surrendering to
an absurd scare, they put an embargo on
the sale of cattle from the Werribee
sewage farm, with the immediate result
that about 500,0001 b. of prime dressed
beef has been consigned to the boiling-
down works. Some small-minded people
won’t be satisfied until they get rid of
the sewage farm, one of the finest things
of its kind in the world, in which
£1,200,000 of public money is invested,
and which has returned £40,000 to
£50,000 over working expenses in a single
year ; and the Government has been their
meek instrument.
The very act of attending Parliament
House became a bore. Parliament went
into recess with a bored Opposition mak-
ing a bored protest of a sort. The spectre
of another session seemed to intrude
upon the holiday calm. It was given
out that there would be no other session,
and that Parliament would remain out
of action till June, 1935, That woke
somebody up. Outsiders began to ask
what the Ministry had been doing that
it needed nine months’ rest before enter-
ing upon an election campaign. Others
not so punctilious about their reputation
for good taste said things that were posi-
tively discourteous. It was dreadfully
disconcerting, but Ministers had to meet
to consider the situation. Then came the
announcement that the election would
be held, not in nine months, but in six
weeks.
The struggle to come to a decision left
the Government exhausted, but after
several days it recovered and flew a kite.
A three-year term, it was alleged, was not
long enough to enable big things to be
done by Parliament; let a grateful people
extend it to five years. This was pretty
cool, coming from a Government which
proposed to let the Legislature loaf for
the best part of a year, and which is even
now cutting three months out of the life
of the present Parliament. A better case
might be made out for annual Parlia-
ments. Young Victorians would cer-
tainly prefer them. Under the Argyle
Gosplan, the person who turns 21 this
month would be disfranchised until
he or she turned 26. During the five
years of disenfranchisement no fewer
than 100,000 Victorians would attain
their majority without having any say in
the laws under which they lived. This is
a big figure; most of the revolutions
of the world, ancient and modern, have
been accomplished by fewer than 100,000
people.
All the same, there is small danger
of a young dictator sweeping away the
Premier who has dictated nothing and
acquiesced in everything, and announc-
ing to Bourke-street from the steps of
Parliament House that henceforth he is
to be known as Dinkumissimo. It is
expected that the Government’s knees
will give way again, and that the Gos-
plan will be dropped.
TOO BIG FOR THEM.
The chairman of the C.S. and I.R. is
annoyed with the politicians for watering
down his colleague Rivett’s plan, and
has published a just protest. Dr. Rivett
placed at their service what they are
evidently incapable of producing them-
selves —an idea. He put it to them that,
with gold at a substantial premium, a
great many idle men and youths could
be profitably employed in a scientifically
organised search for it; that our credi-
tors, while increasingly unwilling to take
their interest in wool, wheat, beef,
mutton, apples, butter and eggs, would
accept all the gold we could send them,
and that it was not fantastic to suppose
that we could discover, dig out and
extract the equivalent of our overseas
debt —“at £6 sterling an ounce” (it is
more than £7 now) “some 264 million
tons of 7dwt. ore.”
Ours is a heavily mineralised country.
Is it stretching the imagination too much
to believe that a heap one sq. mile in area
and 44 yards high exists in reasonably
accessible deposits?... .The search for
auriferous deposits is not being conducted
with anything like the thoroughness and
care that we bestow on the attainment of
profitable crops of sultanas and fat lambs.
Dr. Rivett outlined his plan in the
C.S. and I.R. “Journal.” After several
months it got past the complacency of
the politicians, and a conference was held
to consider it. Says Mr. Julius:
That conference decided merely to make
£400,000 available to the States for sending
out parties of prospectors here and there.
It amounts to another palliative.
Mr. Stewart, “Parliamentary Under-
secretary for Re-employment,” protests
that this is incorrect. The amount pro-
vided “by us” is really £333,000: £95,000
for prospecting ; the balance for “battery
plants, drills, water supplies, roads to
existing fields, geological and other tech-
nical staffs, and monetary advances to
mining syndicates.” If Mr. Stewart knew
as much about goldmining as he does
about the motor-’bus trade, he would not
be so confident as to the adequacy of
£238,000 for “such purposes.” Dr. Rivett
flatly condemned the “practice of giving
an unemployed man a tent, a pick and
shovel and sending him out to prospect.”
On Mr. Stewart’s own showing this
absurdity is to be continued.
“Goldmining,” Dr. Rivett said, “ab-
sorbs labor in great quantity.” This has
been shown in Westralia during the last
12 months, and it has been demonstrated to
a far greater extent in South Africa. That
country indeed has no longer an unem-
ployment problem, and Australians in
the building trade are beginning to
migrate to Johannesburg, where there is
abundance of work at wages much
higher than are paid in this country. The
impetus given to the industry by the gold
premium has had other striking effects,
as J. A. Agnew testifies.
In the space of a year the country has
been converted from a state of inaction
with a large accumulated deficit to one of
almost general prosperity with a surplus
of £6,500,000 —a position unique in the
world. The Union will show another very
large surplus during the current year.
Direct revenue from the mines comprises
over 40 p.c. of the total Budget.
The phlegmatic Afrikander Govern-
ment takes 64 p.c. of the increased profits
due to the premium. Without going to
that length, Australia might conceivably
do as much in the way of finding work
for its idle hands and more in the direc-
tion of paying off its overseas debt.
This country has great tracts of
known auriferous country still in the
possession of the Crown. Scientific
resources unknown to the battlers
of the ’nineties are at its disposal.
It has learned from its experience
with Amalgamated Wireless that public
and private capital can be usefully
allied where there are opportunities
to be availed of by capable men. If
goldmining companies were formed on
the A.W.A. model shareholders would, at
the worst, get a run for their money.
As things are, no small part of the Aus-
tralian capital going into new flotations
is lining the pockets of liars. Greedy
speculators are taking up abandoned
leases and prospecting areas and making
fortunes by trafficking in them, grabbing
as much as they can in cash. Most of
the profits extracted from Wiluna, Sons
of Gwalia, Lake View and Star and the
rest of the Golden Mile group are going
overseas ; and obviously it will be the
same with Yellowdine. All the materials
for a boom are present, but Australia
won’t get much out of it save wages and
railway charges and taxes —and the
taxes are so trifling that in Westralia, at
least till recently, they didn’t bring in the
cost of caring for poor devils “dusted”
in the mines. The Government met that
out of its colossal deficit.
The Rivett plan was too big for the
politicians. It is an age of small men
and mean ambitions.
AMATEURISM IN SPORT.
This silly and antiquated convention
originated in England after the indus-
trial revolution, and as a result of it.
Practically all values were estimated in
terms of money. If a man owned
£lOO,OOO he was a gentleman and could
aspire to a baronetcy ; with quarter of
a million he might become a baron.
The “Gentlemen of England” who
meet the “Players” every year at cricket
are gentlemen because they are not sup-
posed to make money out of the game,
though several, such as W. G. Grace,
virtually lived on it even in the nineteenth
century. A gentleman rider was defined
by the Jockey Club in the Victorian era
as one who “could produce evidence of
substantial private means,” and the
National Hunt Committee still sticks to
the principle in practice. Nominally, any-
body who has ridden 10 winners on
public courses becomes a professional;
he must touch his hat to owners and
trainers, avoid certain hotels, sacrifice
caste generally. It is one reason why
some jockeys are reluctant to forego
their amateur status.
A means test is applied in one form
or another to all popular English sports.
No one can row at Henley who follows,
or has followed, a “menial occupation.”
And the “taint of professionalism” is a
very real taint. Though professional
cricketers no longer use different gates
at all English grounds, and though most
amateurs are as outwardly friendly to
them as followers of fashionable packs
are to hunt employees, they are still
classed as domestic servants.
The executives of most sporting bodies
are driven to absurd subterfuges nowa-
days in the struggle to satisfy the world
that athletes who attract gates worth
thousands sterling are amateurs in
terms of the original English definition
—sportsmen who have no need to make
money out of sport. The notorious
truth is that all our Test cricketers and
nearly all England’s alleged amateur
cricketers are pros. While cricketers re-
main in the public eye they coin money
in the form of luxury trips overseas;
gifts from admirers (equivalent to
jockeys’ tips from employers and
backers); dividends from sports shops,
and so on.
Champion tennis-players, with very
few exceptions, are professionals who,
beginning life usually as needy lads, are
able to travel the world in splendor.
Many are constantly on the verge of
joining up with a professional troupe
which, though it may not make as much
in six months as Wimbledon does in one,
is able to pay its best men the salaries
of movie stars. Certain amateurs in
every branch of sport are disconcertingly
frank about the only consideration that
keeps them from crossing the line. This
appeared in the “S. M. Herald”;
Hampson, the sprinter, denied a rumor
that he had been approached with an
offer. Whether he would turn professional
after the centenary games would, he said,
depend first upon an offer being made,
and then upon the amount of the offer.
With most of them, however, the social
factor operates. Such is the staying
power of snobbery that a confessed pro.
is nearly as much of a pariah as he was
in Thackeray’s day.
It is time that a tradition which never
had any justification was ended. If men
or women decide to earn their livings as
golfers, tennis-players or what not, they
should no more be prejudiced than those
who go in for other professions or trades.
The change, in addition to removing a
cause of bitter heartburnings among
those engaged in sport, would relieve
sporting bodies of the duty of deciding
that eternal and insoluble problem
“What is an amateur?”
SECOND DIVVY.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Overseas Air Mail.
The Australia-England air mail has had
bad luck from the beginning. The Gov-
ernment and the companies concerned
adopted the new D.H.86 four-engined
Dragon-type machines, parrying comment
on their comparative slowness with the
argument that they were built for safety
and capacity to give service in all weathers.
The first machine of the type to ascend
with passengers in Australia disappeared
into Bass Strait with 11 persons on
board. A second crashed in Central
Queensland, killing the crew.
The Commonwealth and British Civil
Aviation Departments held inquiries.
The Australian one came to nothing.
The highly capable chief pilot of Qantas
took one of the machines up with a
committee observing, and afterwards
testified to their reliability—a sincere
opinion, as anyone who knows Mr. Brain
will believe, but still that of an interested
party. It was decided not to issue a report.
The results of the British inquiry, how-
ever, were made public by Mr. Ross, who
made check tests of Mr. Brain’s trials.
It appears that the machine, as origin-
ally designed, was apt to “yaw”— i.e., to
behave under strong application of the
Servo rudder as a sensitive horse does
when he feels too tight a rein. It did
this so much that “it would have been
difficult to maintain control in blind
flying.” The removal of the Servo rudder
which caused the trouble gave “100 p.c.
improvement in directional stability.”
In the absence of the D.H.B6’s, the
service has been carried on with the
London-India mail machines, substan-
tially of the Astrsea type, and with
Qantas ’planes. Every mail has been
late at some point on the run overseas
to and from Darwin, and usually there
has been a rush to make up time.
The first inward machine to strike the
monsoon could not find Darwin because
it arrived at dusk, late. Somebody had
forgotten to light the beacon, and wire-
less communication with Koepang had
failed. That machine came down in the
wilds; fortunately, its wireless worked
feebly on the ground. She got away,
leaving a rescue machine disabled.
Attempting to leave Darwin she became
bogged in the mud, her wing tips bumped
and it took four hours to dig her out.
The pilot said sultry things about the
landing ground.
The next inward ’plane was one of
the restored D.H.B6’s, Captain Youell—-
one of the few men who have flown a mil-
lion miles. Leaving Darwin for Koepang
it took an hour to get her off the ground
for some reason unstated, and because of
head winds and difficult navigation con-
ditions she could not make the 500-odd
miles to Koepang. She was faced with
petrol shortage, so she returned to
Darwin. This ’plane is to have “extra
petrol tanks fitted to increase the flying
range.”
If Mr. Parkhill is satisfied with results
to date, the public is not.

Melbourne’s Aerodrome.
Mascot, the Sydney aerodrome, is some
miles out of the city ; Essendon, the Mel-
bourne aerodrome, is still further from
the G.P.O. Moreover, its surroundings
are such that a casual observer would
imagine it had been prepared for an
aerial obstacle race.
The Essendon landing-ground is sur-
rounded by a network of wires—not
only telegraph and telephone lines, but
high-tension wires calculated to volt into
eternity anybody touching them. As a
further “hazard,” there are a few wire-
less masts which carry no lights at
night, and in the centre some practical
joker has constructed a fair-sized reser-
voir. As a bunker in the new game of
aerial golf, Essendon would probably be
a huge success. As an aerodrome, it is
a tragic joke.
Everybody has known the truth about
Essendon ever since flying came to Mel-
bourne, but the protests of aviators and
the air-minded were regarded as so much
piffle until Lord Sempill visited Essen-
don, stood aghast and, when he recovered
his speech, had his criticisms duly re-
ported. The noble airman spoke briefly but
pointedly. He gave Essendon “nothing.”
Summing up the disadvantages, he ob-
served that there was “everything there
but a cemetery,” adding that he felt
lucky in that, losing his way coming
from England, he had made a forced
landing on Portsea Beach, 50 miles away
from Essendon.
Lord Sempill proceeded to elaborate
something else which everybody knew
before but which nobody could get
the ear of authority about—that Mel-
bourne possesses at her very door an
ideal site for an aerodrome at Fisher-
man’s Bend. The centre of this site is
within two miles of the G.P.0.; it is
approached and bisected by a wide con-
crete road ; it is on the banks of the
Yarra, up against Port Melbourne pier,
and within a stone’s-throw of a railway
station. Its soil is sandy and quick-
drying ; it is accessible from all sides ;
and it is situated in a spot which on
two sides is destitute of habitations, while
there are only a few scattered cottages
on the third.
At various times the claims of Fisher-
man’s Bend as an aerodrome have been
put forward, and on each occasion Pre-
mier Argyle has retorted that the area
is too valuable to be used for such a
purpose. For 50 years Fisherman’s Bend
has been retained as a Never-Never
Land because some politician has held
that it is too valuable to be used for
anything but “desirable villa residences,”
which for 50 years have failed to materi-
alise.

What Kind of White Labor?
It was officially announced last week
that “the Japanese will employ white
labor” if the Commonwealth allows
them to mine the iron-ore deposits of
Yampi Sound. Does this mean Aus-
tralian labor? Or does it mean Russian
white labor, of which, according to a
recent League of Nations report, there is
an overwhelming supply in North Asia?
The League is pledged to find employ-
ment for about a million of these Rus-
sian refugees by 1938.
Most Australians who know the Singa-
pore route know these people. They are
indubitably white, and their physical
standard is fairly high ; their mental and
cultural standards are low. It has been
urged on their behalf that they are
ideal workers under a foreman, being
imbued with the communal spirit and
accustomed by training and tradition to
give blind allegiance and obedience to a
superior. The same qualities make them
easy game for agitators.
If our Japanese neighbors are allowed
to get a footing at Yampi awkward inter-
national problems must automatically
arise, as they did in California and else-
where ; and such problems are bound to
be intensified if the wrong kind of labor
is used.

Heat and Fashion.
“El V.”: Forty persons collapsed and
two died of the heat in Sydney one day
last week. It wasn’t serious heat —no-
thing like the dry blaze of Innamincka
or Broken Hill or Boulder City. Rabaul
lives for a large part of the year in the
sort, of heat Sydney experienced—with
a few earthquakes thrown in for small
change; India and Bagdad suffer it
during the summer season. Rarely in
those places does any white die or even
complain of heat.
The white man in a Sydney heat-wave
wears a tweed suit, a felt hat and heavy
boots. He feeds on hot roast beef and
beer. In Brisbane he descends to alpaca,
Assam silk and the hotter kind of helmet.
In Rockhampton and Townsville he
walks about without coat and waistcoat;
further north still he takes off his shirt
and doesn’t work in the heat of the day.
In India, on a day like the lethal
one in Sydney, the male population
would have worn shorts, a helmet, an
open-necked shirt and a coat. Every
verandah would have been hung with
sac sac palm matting, kept continually
wet. Work would have begun early in
the morning. In Bagdad the beginning
hour is 6 a.m. ; breakfast is at 9.30;
the day’s toil is over by noon.
In Australia, where houses get hotter
and there is more iron roofing as you
go north, the hours of an English city
are kept. This, together with irrational
housing, clothing and feeding, helps to
keep alive the idiotic notion that great
parts of the continent are not fit for
whites to live in.
*
The Phagocyte’s Paradise.
Australia is the paradise of the phago-
cyte that waxes fat on the bodies of the
tubercles it destroys in its small-game
hunt through the human system. This
fact has so impressed itself on the mind
of Dr. Southwood, chairman of the
Adelaide Health Board, that he sug-
gested to the Science Congress the pos-
sibility of wiping tuberculosis out of
Australia.
World statistics printed in the Com-
monwealth “Year-Book” are striking. In
Queensland annual deaths from t.b.
number 40 per 100,000 of population.
Queensland stands at the head of the
table. At the other end is Japan, home
of a wiry, vigorous race, but with a grim
t.b. record, 196 deaths per 100,000. As
a whole, the Australian death-rate is
51 ; the only places on earth which make
a better showing are the S’African
Union (45) and M.L. (46). In the U.S.A.
the rate is 81 ; in England and Wales,
93 ; in the Irish Free State, 127; in
Northern Ireland, 140. Hot Ceylon and
cold Denmark stand level with 78.
Much of the credit for Australia’s rela-
tively favorable position must be
assigned to medical men whose propa-
ganda is constantly leading to improve-
ment in hygiene and preventive treat-
ment. Twenty years ago the Common-
wealth death-rate was 83, that of Queens-
land 67 and that of Victoria 99—it is
now 59. Reduction of the rate in the
same proportion would mean the accom-
plishment of Dr. Southwood’s ideal
before half a century has passed. With
greater attention to housing, purify and
amplitude of food supplies and improve-
ment of general conditions of life it
might not take that long.

“Blazing Indiscretions.”
Dear Bulletin, —In Holman’s reminis-
cences (B. 23/1/’35) appears the follow-
ing :
Griffith was commencing to commit cer-
tain blazing indiscretions.
It may perhaps be of interest to your
readers to know what actions of mine
Mr. Holman had in mind. I think I
can tell them.
From various conversations I had with
Mr. Holman, I know he regarded my
proposal to establish a State monopoly
in petrol, and my action in obtaining a
firm offer from Anglo-Mexican for a five
years’ supply, as a splendid thing for the
State, but still a risky step, one that
might, by incurring enmity, bring disaster
on the Government in the precarious
position in which it then stood. Subse-
quent events fully justified his fears.
William Holman was no coward —he
was, as a matter of fact, one of the
most courageous fighters I have ever
known —but he did not relish the idea of
stirring up the bitter hostility of powerful
organisations when it was not actually
necessary to do so. A charge of an
attempt to secure a huge bribe was
launched. Mr. Justice Bring, acting
as a Royal Commission, reported that
there was “no evidence that Mr.
Griffith was guilty of corruption or of
any intention to share in any moneys
illicitly paid.” Still, the prominence given
by Sydney and Melbourne dailies to
every allegation made by representatives
of oil companies did succeed in killing the
scheme and temporarily discrediting me
—and, of course, to some degree, the
Government of which I was a member.
Incidentally, I might mention that the
price quoted for highest-grade petrol was
lOd. per gallon, delivered in bulk in Syd-
ney. In view of the subsequent rise in
prices, it would have meant, besides a
reasonable profit to the Government, a
saving to the users of petrol of £300,000
a year during the five years.— Arthur
Griffith.

Electrical Development.
Though coal-generated electricity in big
Australian cities is the cheapest in the
world, Australia lags behind in rural
electrification. It lacks the water re-
sources of other lands.
The solution of the electrical problem
is a matter of co-ordination of generation
methods. Trusting to water alone, many
district hydro-electric plants could not
guarantee a full load to their suppliers,
while coal plants may not be working
to full capacity.
Victoria is gridded by the Yallourn
system. The Burrenjuck hydro-electric
supply serves an area in Riverina ; then
come Port Kembla, Bunnerong and White
Bay (Sydney) and the finely organised
Newcastle public utility. After that,
there is a gap to Kempsey, where
the Nymboida scheme terminates on the
south, but from there on local hydro-
electrics supply the coastal regions right
to the Queensland border, where, after
a small gap, Brisbane links in. North
from Brisbane only local town supplies
are available, but the Barron Falls plant
is being built with much travail and
criticism.
All these systems are linkable into one
unit, and the power of some of them
could be concerted, not only to provide
farmers with farm-machinery and
domestic current, but with transport. As
in some American fruit States, hundreds
of miles which are now served only by
petrol traction could be converted to
trolley feeder systems for the carriage
of both passengers and goods
Councillor Fitzgerald, chairman of the
Clarence River County Council (N.S.W.),
says the interlinking of coastal systems
is of far-reaching importance. To farm-
ing districts it is. The comparatively
small Nymboida station has revolution-
ised dairying life for over 2000 country
households, apart from the service it has
given to town-dwellers.
In Quest of a Good Address.
On Thursday the Sydney dailies fore-
shadowed the following town-planning
schemes without a word of protest:
Parliament Houses to be demolished, and
new ones built on the site of Government
House.
Admiralty House to be enlarged and re-
modelled for use as Government House.
Sydney Hospital to be demolished, and
a new hospital built at Centennial Park or
Victoria Barracks.
St. Andrew’s Cathedral to be demol-
ished, and a new cathedral built on the
hospital or Mint site.
N. S. Wales at June, ’34, owed over
ten millions sterling on the bridge, and
because it isn’t in a position to go on
with the underground railway the once-
flourishing Quay area has become a trade
backwater. Clearly it can’t afford any
of the foregoing luxuries. But if one is
more unjustified than another it is surely
the proposal to tear down a beautiful
and historic cathedral and rebuild it else-
where at the expense largely of taxpayers
of all denominations. Unfortunately it is
the one which the Stevens Government is
most likely to be bluffed into adopting.
About the only thing to be said for
the desire of the C. of E. authorities to
move eastwards is that it is in a sense
English. In England tremendous import-
ance is attached to what is known as a
“good address.” The present site of
St. Andrew’s was an excellent address
when the cathedral was built; since then
the tide of fashion has turned towards
St. James’s, leaving Anglican h.q. in the
position of St. Paul’s, London.
Until about a century ago rich men
lived on the northern heights near St.
Paul’s, and over their warehouses and
shops in the vicinity; now its congrega-
tions come largely from residential areas
which were dairy farms in Wren’s day.
Though Ludgate Hill is deserted on Sun-
days the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s
don’t talk of pulling their cathedral down
and following the flag of fashion to, say,
Park-lane, at the nation’s expense. The
nation would be shocked at the idea, not
only on financial and sentimental
grounds, but because the establishment
of a rule that cathedrals must be in
fashionable quarters would mean no secu-
rity of tenure for any cathedral.
Inside ten years, with the development
of aviation, the southern end of Mac-
quarie-street may be as unfrequented as
the northern end of Pitt-street is now.
Assuming that the Anglican authorities
get the Mint site and are consistent, N. S.
Wales may find them demanding a
cathedral site {plus £500,000 compensa-
tion for leaving Macquarie-street) in
Sydney’s new Mayfair, Mascot.

Let Them be Sold!
“Montague” has an idea:
Years ago I found myself in a hotel bar,
endeavoring to persuade homeward an ac-
quaintance whose father was a baronet. Hav-
ing kept down his fourteenth, he declined my
good offices. A member of the King and
Country League then called upon my bibulous
friend to take a pull at himself, reminding him
that he would be a baronet some day. “Think
of the baronetcy!” he repeated. The heir
sprawled round on the wet bar and, fixing the
speaker with a fishy eye, observed, “Give me
a quid and you can have the blanky thing.”
My friend, by this time a baronet and un-
married, was gathered to his forefathers. The
title went to a relative —a relative I knew
even better. He was not addicted to the flow-
ing bowl. He was a hard-working, decent
chap who never got a chance in life. Some-
times he was boots at a pub ; sometimes he
cleaned windows ; sometimes he went from
door to door trying to induce people to make
their fortunes by investing in Perpetual Stalac-
tite Bonds, redeemable in 10,000 years when the
stalactites had grown to marketable dimensions.
He had a wife and a small family. At no time
for 10 years had he gathered into the ancestral
home a weekly sum equal to the basic wage.
While the late baronet in a fit of drunken
generosity was ready to barter his label for a
pound, the present owner of the title would
part with it at a reasonable figure were such
a thing possible. And there are Australians
who would put at least £5OOO in his hand if
he were able to transfer it legally. There you
have supply and demand, with legality standing
between in restraint of trade—another instance
of the inefficiency of distribution bringing about
economic chaos.
All titles should be negotiable just as are a
block of land, a car and an outfit of cutlery.
There would always be buyers ; even a K.B.
would bring four figures if the market were
watched carefully, and K.Bs. in reduced cir-
cumstances would be glad to sell. Then there
is the ambitious man who, having had a knight-
hood for years and seen bitter enemies
knighted, lusts for something better. Why
shouldn’t he be permitted to buy a baronetcy
and turn in his used knighthood as he does a
used car? If he would leave the job to me I’d
fix it through my dole-getter and rake off a
good commission for myself.
When Mr. Lyons is preparing his next policy
speech he might consider this question. The
Commonwealth could profit handsomely by
charging for re-registrations and requiring
duty stamps on all necessary documents, thus
helping to restore prosperity. And in the bank-
ruptcy records of the future we might see
that the assets of the insolvent comprised “One
suite of furniture, two carpets, one radio set, a
quantity of empty bottles and one knighthood.”
When they read that creditors would have no
cause for worry. The bidding for that knight-
hood would be such as to ensure the liquida-
tion of any debts in reason.

whole thing was ridiculous, and Gus
obviously thought so, too. His large, red
face, brown pop-eyes and immense
calves, which he displays in plus-fours
on golfing days, have devastated several
barmaids. One hailed him as “Hello

when I met him the day after the deci-
sion. “It was a frame-up,” he raged. “1

they were O.K. and needed no attention
whatever. The girl admitted that there
was nothing wrong with her teeth, but
wished to have them separated because
it was “very lucky.” As his brows
knitted, she explained: “A friend of

The other day she got engaged to a

his statue was unveiled on the spot
marked X—it is in the gardens of
the Luxembourg. Possibly there are
precedents, but I can’t recall any.
Charles I. certainly has a statue in
London, but it is at Charing Cross, not
at Whitehall. I wonder if there are any
memorials to the Marshal in his native
Saar.

“Clan C”: “Claymore” (B. 23/1/’35)
is wrong in his statement that the Black
Watch was originally a military-police
force raised after —not before —Cul-
loden. The Black Watch was raised in
1725, on General Wade’s recommenda-
tion ; he took the cue from the local
“watches” kept up by Lord Lovat, the
Duke of Athol and Cluny Macpherson
for policing the Highlands. The Earl of
Crawford was the first colonel; he was
followed by Lord Sempill, ancestor of
the flying man —both before 1745. The
regiment was taken to London in 1743,
the reason given being that George 11.
wished to inspect it. But George was
away in Hanover, and, doubtful about his
intentions, the men started to march
back to Scotland. At Northampton they
agreed to return to London, General
Blakeney having promised that they were
to undergo no more than an inspection. On
their return, however, three of them were
promptly hanged, and the regiment was
split up into companies and sent to over-
seas stations. This was in 1743 ; I have
a letter to-day in my possession written
by Lord Lovat to Cluny Macpherson (his
son-in-law) deploring the “sad fate and
loss of so many of your pretty fellows.”

“Skilligolee”: Having heard several
arguments over the pronunciation of the
Chief Scout’s name, I can give a tip—
straight from the horse’s mouth, so to
speak. I was on the Natal “Mer-
cury” staff when 8.-P., fresh from
his Mafeking achievements, was being
feted there. At the banquet I heard
the General settle the question of
the pronunciation of his name. “I wish
people wouldn’t call me Ba/iden-Powell,”
he remarked ; “Baden-Powell rhymes
with bathing-towel, and that’s easy
enough to pronounce! ” Passing over
the difficulty of rhyming “Baden” with
“bathing,” this ought to be conclusive.

“M.G.”: Sabbatarian objection to
Sunday amusement has now narrowed
itself down in Vic. to “organised sport” ;
hence a kick is being made against a
display of visiting swimmers in Cres-
wick pool, though Sunday is the only
day available for them. In the dear
dead days of my boyhood we were for-
bidden to play anything, however dis-
organised, with the result that most of
us went round the scrub and smoked
tea-tree roots; others played two-up;
a few older ones, whom we regarded
with great respect, were able to crash the
back gates of neighboring pubs. Most
of the Sabbatarian fraternity wink at
tennis to-day, while still keeping a united
front against cricket and football. The
objection to Sunday bathing has long
since vanished, and even clerics may
be seen disporting themselves on the
beaches.

“Oxmead”: The latest developments
in the New State movement in N. S.
Wales remind me that, only 13 years
ago, Westralia, which is now seeking to
cut loose from the Commonwealth,
possessed discontented portions which
were just as convinced that their welfare
depended on cutting loose from Perth.
They took their grievances so seriously
that they even sent a delegate all the
way to Albury (N.S.W.) to attend a con-
ference which was to discuss the possi-
bilities of splitting up Australia into
more manageable sections. The dele-
gate was Pat Stone, a citizen and
something of an institution of Gerald-
ton, who had served a couple of
terms in the State Assembly. There
was no more earnest and uncompromis-
ing New Stater at the Albury confer-
ence than the whiskered Patrick, who
arrived with a suitcase full of documen-
tary evidence to show how intolerably his
bit of the State, though its chief town
was within 300 miles of the capital, had
suffered from “Perth centralisation.” If
Westralia ever should succeed in getting
out of the Commonwealth, it is safe bet-
ting that it would be the prelude to two
or three sub-secession movements inside
its own borders.

“S.T.S.”: A. J. Green, retiring from
S.A. Water Supply Department after 50
years’ service, has published a series of
observations and forecasts for successors
and posterity. (1) “The more water
available the more is consumed.” (2)
“More water is wasted than is beneficially
used.” (3) Mt. Bold reservoir, when
finished, will keep Adelaide safe for per-
haps half a century. But (4) the whole
offrun from the Mt. Lofty Range can
supply only about 600,000 people ; the
metropolitan district already has 300,000.
So (5) the city will have to link up,
sometime, somehow, with the “practically
inexhaustible” Murray behind the ranges.

“Keg.”: Scotch regiments in Aus-
tralia? Returning home, early in TB,
on a hospital ship, I came across
a cartoon in a South African
paper. Dialogue: Recruiting Offi-
cer: “You are of Scotch descent;
why not join the South African
Scottish?” Young Man: “No
good, sarge, I can’t speak Dutch ”
It made me glad I was an Austra-
lian and placed no sentimental value on
the kilt.
* * * *
“G. Trotter”: I don’t know what Aus-
tralian characteristics Geoffrey Knox
can have retained (B. 16/1 /’35); but I
can certify that it takes few years for
people to lose their national veneer. I
once chatted with a man on the wharf
at Marseilles when we were both awaiting
the mailboat. I asked him whether he had
ever been in Australia. “I was born
theah,” he replied. “I only left Mel-
bourne for England eight yahs ago.” I
marvelled how a man could have learned
the language of Cockayne in so short a
' time ; yet there was no affectation about
him ; he talked as if he had come straight
from the Old Kent-road. In a shop at
San Francisco, I was fraternising with a
man whom I regarded as a 100 per cent.
Yank when I noticed an Olympic medal
on his chain. I asked him his athletic
line. “I was in the British hurdling
team,” he replied. “You British?” I
inquired dazedly. “Sure,” he told me, in
an accent like Will Rogers’s. Anybody
who listened to Dr. Chen, the Chinese
Consul-General, from behind a curtain
would swear that the speaker came from
Dallas (Texas) or Schenectady (N.Y.). He
put in seven years in Bawston (Mass.),
and that completely obliterated the Eng-
lish he learned from English teachers
before he left China. My experience is
that this sort of thing takes place all
round. My own father, who lived 50-
odd years in Australia, spoke an entirely
different dialect from his brothers and
sisters, whom I met on a visit to England.

“10-2-4” clears it up:
The following appeared some days ago in
the “S. M. Herald”;
“Widower, 34, tall, £5OO p.a., seeks, view
marr., attrac. titian-haired lady. Holts.”
Obviously no tall young widower with £5OO
p.a. would need to advertise for a wife,
realised immediately that this was one of those
cryptographs through which the real author ot
Shakspeare’s plays (Bacon? Essex? Queen
Elizabeth?) communicated the truth to pos-
terity After considerable thought I worked
it out. “Widower tall” is Mr. Lang, who,
though bereaved of office in ’32, only began to
find his lonely state unendurable in ’34. Until
last year he believed that one of the Labor
unity conferences —equivalent to the matri-
monial bureaus of civil life—would bring him
happiness again. The £5OO represents the
amount left of Mr. Lang’s Parliamentary
salary (£620 p.a.) after Mr. McMahon has done
with it. The “attrac. titian-haired [or T.H.]
lady” is the cryptographer’s poetic way of imag-
ing Mr. Scullin. (One is reminded of the “dark
lady” of the Sonnets.) Note the extension of
the olive branch. The Federal Labor leader,
who used to be “T. 8.,” becomes “T.H.,” or
Trades Hall—the highest tribute Mr. Lang can
pay him. Finally we get the word of power
“holts.” It is a pledge. The proposed union
is to be no trial marriage, but a coming-
together for holts or keeps.
Some might think it odd of Mr, Lang to make
his advances through the “S. M. Herald,
and in cipher, but such methods of approach
are fairly common. Prof. Maicßurmsai has
proved to his own satisfaction that the “Areo-
pagitica” —usually attributed to Milton—is
really an appeal by the seventeenth-century
bard Rabbie Wayzguis for freedom to per-
petuate Scottish Gaelic.
HAGGIS.
“At the annual dinner of Sydney’s Burns Society,
the haggis was borne to the official table by a
gigantic Scot, while pipers skirled an accompani-
ment.”
Whene’er his natal day returns
Scots meet and eat together;
Their heads are full of Rabbie Burns,
Their buttonholes of heather.
On evTy tongue, from songs he sung,
Some apt and telling tag is;
And evTy heart with pride’s aglow
As, ceremonious and slow.
They carry in the haggis.
’Tis only Scots who know by rights
The things that go into it,
The luscious liver and the lights.
The oatmeal and the suet.
Whatever’s there, we’re all aware,
Boiled in its native bag is.
And oh! what memories cluster round
The dish as, to the bagpipes’ sound,
They usher in the haggis.
Some bard has sung old England’s beef,
His theme with music hooding,
But none has found a worthy chief,
Save Burns alone, in pudding.
Brave staves he’d troll about the bowl
Wherein the whisky snag is,
But firmer the poetic tie
That binds and links eternally
His honored name with haggis.
How much, I wis, we Saxons miss,
Esteemed where loch and crag is!
Not mine, God knows, the guilt and blame,
But let me here and now proclaim
With something near akin to shame:
I never tasted haggis.

“Lex”: A Newtown (Sydney) magis-
trate denounced a criminal last week.
Without exception, you are the most
loathsome animal I have ever seen.... You
are not fit to live, etc.
And then the punishment.
You will be fined £5.
The anti-climax of an Indian Judge is
famous: “Here you are, an able-bodied
man, respectably brought up, instead of
which you go about the country stealing
ducks.” And then there was the explo-
sion of the pre-Federation politician who
had suddenly realised the powers of Eng-
land’s permanent officials: “For 15 years
we Victorians imagined that this was
an autonomous colony under the Crown,
and it now seems that during all that
time we have been ruled by a person
named Higinbotham.” There are others
as celebrated, but I submit that the effort
of the Newtown Solon equals any of
them.

“Crash”; A Maoriland doctor had
just retired at midnight after a busy
day when there came a ring on the

“Tiki”: A case of a sort that has more
parallels in fiction than in real life has
come to light in Palmerston North, M.L.
The eldei .j widow of a doctor who had
died 30 years previously died suddenly.
She had lived alone, though very wealthy.
Her large house, surrounded by extensive
grounds, was guarded by two fierce dogs,
and her death was not discovered for
several days. When the
police entered the
house they found that
in many rooms nothing
had been disturbed
since the successive
deaths of the occu-
pant’s husband and
son. Cigarette butts
remained in ashtrays ;
guns, fishing-rods and
walking-sticks were in
their accustomed
places ; wardrobes were
filled with male attire,
some of which had
never been worn. In
the garage, standing be-
side a luxurious mod-
ern car in which the
widow sometimes took
a drive (engaging a
chauffeur by the hour),
was an ancient De
Dion, its tyres long
perished, left just as it
was after the doctor’s last round. The
house is described by the local news-
papers as a veritable museum of art
treasures and curios. A year before her
death the old lady broke her rule to the
extent of sending a set of gold apostle
spoons to Christie’s in London. They
brought £lO,OOO.

“Bangemall”; Harry Gregory, M.H.R.,
though a few years older than the late
Walter Kingsmill, is of the same Parlia-
mentary vintage (B. 23/l/’35). Both
entered the Westralian Assembly in 1897 ;
they sat together in the first post-Forrest
Ministry and in two or three subsequent
ones. Gregory further resembles Kings-
mill in having sustained only two defeats
at the polls and in the fact that only one
of them mattered ; on the first occasion
he petitioned, had the election upset and
was returned when it was refought. That
was at Menzies in 1908. His unequivocal
reverse three years later sent Gregory into
Federal politics, after a break of over
a twelvemonth, 10 years before Kings-
mill came to join him there. Like his
deceased colleague, Giegory moie than
once filled the office of Acting-Premier
in Westraha over a quarter of a century
&go.
“Kwakprak”: Malaria is even to this
day more prevalent m England than “Cm-
chona” (B. 16/1/’35) thinks. The Essex
“Yes, I know you. I remember now. Attended your wedding, didn’t I —or
was it your funeral?”
marshes were providing quite a few
cases when I last was in London
years ago. The only influence of rivers
and swamps on the disease arises from
their suitability for the welfare of some
malaria-carrying species of anopheline
mosquito which has opportunity to feed
on humans. In the South Pacific archi-
pelagoes there is a curiously definite
dividing line, geographically, between
malarial and non-malarial island groups,
although all the conditions may seem
identical.

records on a battered gramophone near
the League of Nations Secretariat in
Geneva? In himself the old lad was not
in the least interesting, but some person
of sardonic wit had hung over his stand
a notice which, translated, ran: “Behold
here the true inwardness of the League
of Nations!” The cheerful legend
enabled him to make a good living by
blaring out discordant noises which he
could not hear, through an apparatus
which he did not understand, to an
audience which he could neither hear
nor see and didn’t want to understand —
anyhow, so long as it paid.

“Bert t h e Carpenter”: The Yankee
gangster’s sub-machine-gun (B. 16/1/’35)
a g originally invented bv Thomoson as
a po | ic e weapon and named ‘S gun”
the cr i mina i s collared the idea from
the police. The original guns were like
an outsize automatic pistol with a clip
magazine; the drum-type magazine was
a later improvement. Automatic pistols
have never been popular with the Ameri-
can underworld; the favorite pocket
weapon of the gangster is the .45-calibre
revolver, which never gets out of action,
can fire as rapidly as any automatic, and
is far deadlier. The victim who has
stopped a big, soft-lead slug with any
part of his body mostly loses all interest
in the proceedings, whereas a man who
has been hit by a little nickel pea from
a pistol can keep on fighting back unless
a vital part has been hit. My infor-
mation came from a Yankee plainclothes
man.

“Lemanark”: In 1927 I was employed
in the Government offices in Darwin for
a few months before going trepanging.
An inspector came up from the South
to investigate local conditions, and each
clerk in turn had to go before him.
When I went in he was feverishly rub-
bing his bald pate with a silk handker-
chief. “I suppose,” he shot at me, “you
agree with the other civil servants here
that the climate is absolutely the limit?”
My reply was, “I came here in 1909, and
from then until 1925, except for two
years at the front, I shot buffaloes for
eight months out of every 12, and aver-
aged running and walking 100 miles a
week. I have been in most parts of the
world, and consider that the Northern
Territory is the finest place I have
lived in.” The inspector glared at me
for a moment, then said, “Well, I’ll be
damned! I think that this weather is
unbearable.” That afternoon the head
of my department came to me and re-
marked, “Why the hell did you tell the
inspector what you did? He’ll be cutting
down all our salaries.”
* # * Hi
“Farleigh”: Some English paper re-
marked, apropos of Sir Philip Game, that
military and naval men have proved far
better Governors in Australia than ex-
politicians. It is absolutely true, of
course, one reason being that they have
come to regard politics as outside of
their beat and are not above taking ad-
vice when it is necessary. The politician,
on the other hand, is always liable to
remain one, however he may strive to
repress his tendencies. Sir Gerald (now
Baron) Strickland was the last instance.
Strickland was essentially a politician
from his youth upwards, ever since he
was president of the Cambridge Union,
and there were few communities in which
he wasn’t likely to stir up some sort of
row. Still, the trouble which he occa-
sioned in N. S. Wales was nothing to
that in which he managed to involve
himself in Malta as head of the Ministry
a few years ago. My own opinion is
that, if we must have imported Gov-
ernors, bluff old admirals of the Rawson
and Bedford type make the best sort.
They know their limitations, and their
profession has taught them the virtue of
reticence.

“S.T.S.”: Enter for the record for un-
usual offences “washing a motor-lorry
by means of a hose-pipe,” for which a
factory proprietor (whose employee com-
mitted the crime) got “£4 and £1
costs, or five days.” When
Adelaide’s reservoirs ran low at
the end of winter all hoses were
prohibited; when rains came
they were allowed again, but
only if held in the hand, and not for
washing motors, in any case—which
proviso the offender had overlooked.

“Mako”: Speaking of bank precautions
(B. 23/1/’35), Maoriland still remembers
a case, about 20 years ago, when a youth-
ful bank clerk boarded a tram with a
bag under his arm. He swung off at a
street corner; a moment later the con-
ductor noticed that the bag had been left
behind. He meandered down the aisle
to it, selling tickets as he went, and then
picked up the bag. It was a stoutly-
made canvas concern, but the fact that
he could not lift it with one hand caused
him to investigate. The contents turned
out to be money, mainly sovereigns. The
bag was handed in at the depot, and for-
warded to the head office next morning,
where a perturbed youth, an agitated
manager and a solemn g.m. awaited its
return. Asked how he came to leave
£BOO on a tram seat the youth candidly
replied that his mind must have been on
something else!
“Der Jong”: Having watched him
from the same privileged viewpoint I can
endorse “S.A.C.’s” remarks about the
old-time Boer’s religious outlook (B.
16/1 /’35). I would add that I never
heard any of them mention the Devil or
the Pit. To me, who received my early
ideas on religion from a Cameronian
grandmother, this has always seemed a
strange thing. Though these people be-
lieved implicitly in witchcraft and the
Kafir witch-doctors, the apparition of
Auld Clootie with his horns and pitch-
fork never seemed to haunt them. An-
other point, about the backveld Boer
before the British occupation was that
he supported no police force. Authority
was represented merely by the landrost,
a sort of stipendiary magistrate, and the
veld cornet, who had the power to call
up burghers for police duty if necessary.
Only in Johannesburg, with its motley
foreign population, was it found neces-
sary to establish a regular police force—
the “Zarps,” and they were mostly Con-
tinental uitlanders.
“El V.”; “M. Turlutu” (B. 23/1 /’35)
talks through his cady when he suggests
that Mitchell, Hume, Howitt, Giles and
Forrest were worth a dozen Leichhardts.
Of these five only Giles and Forrest ever
travelled a route which compared with
the Port Essington trek, and even then
they were 25 years later and far better
equipped. The Port Essington journey
was no fluke —you can no more fluke
that sort of journey than you can enter
heaven on a racecourse ticket. Even
A. C. Gregory, who did not like
Leichhardt, thought the Port Essing-
ton expedition “ranked with the greatest
feats of exploration the world has seen.”

POLITICAL POINTS
The familiar report comes from Lon-
don that Australia will have the largest
of the Dominion delegations about to
descend on that city. Lyons himself is
taking his private secretary, his press-
agent and his “confidential typist.”
Typists are trained to be confidential,
and one could easily be borrowed from
Australia House, where there is a flock
of them ; but evidently Joseph prefers to
sting the taxpayers for the cost of an
unnecessary trip. Taxpayers exist to be
stung.
Just before the date of the Victorian
election was announced Labor-leader
Tunnecliffe visited the University Labor
Club’s summer camp and told the young
men they were not to think of him as
“religious.” “I’m probably the most agnos-
tic-minded person here,” he burbled. He
was only trying to be amiable, but his
utterance was reported, and the Rev. Jud-
kins pounced on it with all claws show-
ing, Now poor old Tunny has to explain
it away.
According to A. W. Fadden, who is a
chartered accountant as well as an
M.L.A., governing authorities —Common-
wealth, State and local —are taking
64.9 p.c. of the wealth produced in
Queensland. In 18 years tax- and rate-
revenue has gone up from £4,210,700 to
£16,718,100.
Stevens has withdrawn his embargo on
the steel-pipe contract granted by Syd-
ney’s Water Board to Mephan Ferguson.
A condition was that Mephan Ferguson
should have the pipes made in Sydney,
where hitherto the concern has had no
factory, but even this did not influence
the Sydney Government. However, it
has now receded from the position that
a Victorian manufacturer seeking to ex-
tend his business to Sydney is a
“foreigner.”
Since Westralia achieved responsible
government “Tory” Ministers have scru-
pulously abstained from identifying them-
selves with goldmining companies seeking
public subscriptions. It has been re-
served for a Labor Minister, Willcock,
to let his name go on the list of directors
of Yellowdine Gold Options; capital,
£160,000 in 4s. shares. Willcock is Minis-
ter for “Just Us” in the Government
which has the passing and administering
of the mining laws.
Writing from Johannesburg to The
Bulletin, a correspondent recently men-
tioned that there was a building boom
there consequent upon the boom in gold-
mining. Ten Sydney plasterers are now
going to Jo’burg on a guarantee of 12
months’ work at 3s. 6d. an hour —
£9 14s. Australian for a 44-hour week,
and overtime if they want it. The Union
Government is taking 64 p.c. of mine
profits increased by the premium. It
doesn’t seem to be doing the country
any harm.
J. A. Boyd, who was a State and
Commonwealth politician, and is now a
director of nine or ten Vic. companies,
said a significant thing at the Chamber
of Commerce conference. In 1931 Com-
monwealth and States effected an annual
saving of £6,500,000 by the forced con-
version of internal loans from 6 per
cents, to 4 per cents.; but it has nearly
all gone in interest on subsequent loans.
In four years £100,000,000 has been
borrowed, and much of it has been
thrown away.
Westralia’s Midland Railway Co.,
which serves only farming districts and
has been cut off from the profitable Mur-
chison trade since the Government built
the parallel Goomalling-Mullewa rail-
way (there is another Government line
in between), showed a credit balance
of £75,800 for the year to June 30. Out
of that it is paying taxes and interest on
first- and second-mortgage debentures,
allowing £30,000 for renewals and depre-
ciation and carrying forward £20,000.
The Government railways, which pay no
taxes, showed a loss of £275,600. Yet
they have had the benefit of the mining
revival, which has brought trade back to
the lines running to Kalgoorlie, Norse-
man, Menzies and Leonora.
Comparing the Midland co.’s financial
statements with those of the Westralian
Government concern it is hard to believe
that Government control is not largely
to blame for the immense losses on rail-
ways.
In Victoria last year a scare was
worked up about beef measles on the
sewage farm at Werribee. At the Science
Congress Dr. Boyd Penfold, of the Baker
Research Institute, and Dr. Clunies Ross,
of Sydney’s McMaster Institute, laughed
at the notion of beef measles being a
danger to a public that cooks its butchers’
meat, but meantime the Government,
weakly yielding to the scaremongers, had
forbidden the Metropolitan Board to sell
sewage-farm cattle. So, even while the
scientists were forgathering at Mel-
bourne, 500 - odd
beasts in prime *
condition and free
from live cysts
were being slaugh-
tered for —fertiliser.
Vic. Metropoli-
tan Board of
Works declines to
boil down any
more of its cattle.
It pronounces them
fit for human
consumption, and
threatens to defy
th e Government
and permit the
meat to be sold to
the butchers. In-
ternecine squabbles
between public
bodies are growing
to serious dimen-
sions in Victoria ;
for three weeks
one of the main
avenues out of the
city has been held
up because the
work of repairing
the road is in dis-
pute between the
board and the
Prahran Council.
Perhaps a sort of
local League of
Nations will have
to be set up to determine the functions
of the different utilities.
The N.S.W. Public Service reports a
net increase of 266 employees last year
—mostly in hospitals and mental institu-
tions. However, there have been con-
tinued savings on such items as overtime
and tea-money (29 p.c. below 1929-30),
travelling (£65,000 less), fuel (22.9 p.c.
less), gas and electricity (19.3 p.c. less).
“Damn the expense!” was the motto in
those days.
Vic. Premier Argyle proposes that
Ministerialists should go to the country,
not as members of two parties in alli-
ance, but as one Government party —in
a word, Argylists. It is unlikely that the
rank and file of the Cocky members or
the people who put them there will sub-
mit to being wiped out as a political
entity. But at the first sign of opposition
Argyle will probably weaken, as he has
weakened on his plan for five-year Par-
liaments.
One of the w’recked hopes of the fading
band of Federalists was that the estab-
lishment of the High Court would do
away with appeals to the Privy Council.
There have been many such appeals of
recent years, and the Privy Council has
taken to “granting leave” without refer-
ence to the High Court. It has done so
in Payne v. the Deputy Federal Com-
missioner of Taxation, in which the
point at issue is whether 25 p.c. may be
added for exchange to the taxable income
of an Australian resident earned in
Britain and not brought to Australia.
Duffy, C.J., and brothers Evatt and Mc-
Tiernan were for the Deputy-Commis-
sioner ; brothers Rich, Starke and Dixon
for the taxpayer; and the C.J.’s view-
prevailed.
There is this to be said for Federal
Commissioner Ewing—he’s a demon at
tracking down tax-dodgers in a big way.
Getting a tip from Westralia he went
after the brothers Abrahams, Louis and
Emanuel —so successfully that they and
others confessed to having faked returns
wholesale, and agreed to pay £500,000,
plus £lO,OOO “costs of investigation”
(£200,000 down, the balance in two years,
with 5x p.c. interest added) and a fine of
£lOOO. Now this pertinacious public
servant has wrung confessions of “eva-
sion” from Umberto and Alceste Pelle-
grini, of Melbourne, and obtained leave
to sign judgment for £ 104,000-odd.
CHANGING GUARD.
“Mussolini announces big changes in his Cabinet.”
Senate Minister Tom Brennan has
written a book to demonstrate that the
High Court was wrong when it decided
that Government railway and tramway
employees might carry their grievances
into the Federal Arbitration Court,
and that for an award of that Court
to have the effect of a Common-
wealth law overriding State enactments
is an absurdity, and worse. Many people
will doubtless agree with him, but their
agreement counts for nothing unless they
are given the opportunity to put these
matters right at a referendum.
Pre-selection gets another bad advertise-
ment from the case of Jarvie, M.L.A.
for Ashfield (N.S.W.). In his report
on the McArthur cos. Halse Rogers, J.,
mentioned, in effect, that Jarvie had taken
a job at £6OO a year from a concern, the
British Medical Investment Trust, of
which he knew nothing—“it was not
British and had no connection with the
medical profession”—and, thus ignorant
of essential facts, had allowed his name
to be put on a prospectus.
Mr. Jarvie had been vague as to what his
duties were to be and in the dark as to
which co. he was actually to serve. He had
resigned on the day the commission was
appointed, and had received the salary due.
Coming after an unfortunate occurrence
which necessitated a by-election for Ash-
field in 1929, this suggests that Ashfield
should change its member. But Jarvie
is the “selected” candidate, and under
U.A.P. law no other U.A.P. man may
contest the seat and remain U.A.P.
T. J. Hartigan is leaving for London
next month to play at Wimbledon. No,
it’s Miss Hartigan who is to play at
Wimbledon (and may she win!); Mr.
Hartigan is going on some high State
mission—possibly to ascertain whether
trains still run in Britain and Europe.
He was there in 1929 as Comptroller of
Accounts; since then he has been “Trans-
port Commissioner, Finance Branch,” and
(from Dec. 29, 1932) Chief Commissioner
of Railways—with a rise to £5OOO p.a.,
less financial-emergency cut, power
(exercised) to increase salaries out of
tax-revenue and so little expected of him
that when he reported, with loud
self-applause, that the railways had been
run at a loss of £3,388,100 for the year
to June 30, Premier Stevens dutifully
congratulated him. It is expected that
Mr. Hartigan will buy a fistful of lot-
tery tickets before he departs.
Since the rout in 1932 Lang has felt
lonely without Gosling, his Minister of
Tin Hares, and a great effort is to be
made by the still-faithful to restore Gos-
ling to him. Normally, Kogarah is
Labor, but, after the Savings Bank smash
and the tin-hares and the fruit-machines
and the interest-default and the manoeuvres
against the Commonwealth, the electorate
had so little use for Lang and Gosling
that it gave J. C. Ross, the minor
goose’s opponent, a majority of 1692.
Ross is a Digger, and has proved a
very good local member. He talks too
much in the House, but he goes to no
end of trouble to help distressed con-
stituents. He will take a deal of shifting.
In the light of the fierce border trans-
port row to which the Sydney and Mel-
bourne Governments are parties, some
remarks of N.S.W. Railway Commis-
sioner Hartigan are illuminating. While
rejoicing that it had been held that it
was a breach of the N.S.W. Transport
Act for motor-lorries from Victoria to
carry goods into the Riverina he
warned his Government that it would
be “necessary to maintain a persistent
watch on such traffic.” In effect, to em-
ploy an army of spies to frustrate one
of the great objects of Federation:
“Trade, commerce and intercourse
among the States, whether by means of
internal carriage or ocean navigation,
shall be absolutely free.” And this in
the 35th year of the Australian Com-
monwealth !
From “Wahgunyah”:
This draft of a Riverina State doesn’t satisfy
me. The southern slope of the Murray valley
has just the same interests as the northern,
and a new State along its banks should embrace
the whole watershed, with a seaport at Eden.
Eden is a magnificent site for a capital.
Though the hinterland is mountainous, there
would be no insuperable difficulties in the
way of driving roads westward to carry the
produce of the new State to its natural seaport.
“G.M.” swears to this:
There is a loophole in our voting system.
At one recent election an early voter secured
an initialled paper, retired to his pigeon-
hole and, folding a sheet of paper the same
size and color as the ballot paper, placed
it in the box. The genuine ballot paper,
properly initialled and ready for marking, was
sold to a party boss outside, marked by him
and later placed in the ballot box by another
paid voter, who duly delivered his blank
paper on emerging. The game continued
throughout the day. It is unlikely, however,
that votes were really taken from the other
side. The only practical value was the collec-
tion of small sums by astute rogues from other
rogues not quite so astute.

Norman Taylor, of Adelaide, scores a
double, succeeding Gordon Sunter (re-
tired) as chairman of S.A. Taxpayers’
Association and Herbert Phillipps (de-
ceased) on the Savings Bank board. He
is head of a mercantile firm, and promi-
nent in the A.A.A., Unemployment Coun-
cil and Rotary work.
Dave Dow, who will shortly relinquish
the position of Australia’s representative
in New York, was formerly an agricul-
tural writer on the Melbourne “Leader
—like his father before him. Dow,
senior, was a politician as well as a
journalist. He accompanied Deakin to
California, a result of their trip being to
lay the foundations of all the irrigation
settlements which have since arisen in
Australia.
“D.”: Put it to Sir Philip Game’s
credit that he had less side than any pre-
vious N. S. Wales Governor with the
possible exception of Lord Beauchamp ;
and that he had something of Beau-
champ’s interest in art. A Sydney black-
and-white man got a farewell letter from
Sir Philip which contained this passage:
Few of us are honest enough to admit
it, but we all like to be caricatured, especi-
ally when it is done by a master of the art.
It reveals more of Game, the man his
democratic ways, his charming manners
and his complete lack of conceit —than
a thousand official speeches.
“Tank Stream’s” grouch:
The Sydney dailies reported “a large gather-
ing of members of the Pioneers’ Club to cele-
brate the 147th anniversary of the foundation
of Australia”; and in the lists of those present
there were hardly any names (Blaxland and
Abbott excepted) that the average student of
Early Australiana has ever heard of in con-
nection with pioneering! No Wentworths
and no Hills (the families intermarried); no
Macarthurs; no Lawsons (the explorer’s grand-
son is now in N. S. Wales; also the widow
of Adrian Knox, one of Lawson’s grand-
daughters, and her children); no Fairfaxes,
some of whom are descendants of Simeon Lord
in addition to being descendants of a pioneer
newspaper man; no Antills (the original Antill
was Macquarie’s A.D.C., and a grandson lives
at Manly); no members of the Innes family
(Captain Innes, grandfather of the Supreme
Court Judge, was a Sydney notable a century
ago, and the Judge is descended through his
mother from a Bathurst pioneer); above all
no Stephens. A reunion of N. S. Wales
pioneer families without a Stephen, a Mac-
arthur, a Wentworth, an Antill, a Lawson or
an Innes is not merely “Hamlet” without the
ghost; it is “Hamlet” without half the cast.
Tas. Premiers are making a habit of
motor smashes. Seven years ago Joe
Lyons narrowly escaped death (and
achieved a permanently shortened leg)
when his car butted into a stationary rail-
way train at a level crossing. Ogilvie,
his colleague then, has had to be
treated in hospital for a smashed
nose and cracked ribs after an argu-
ment with a stationary tram. His official
secretary had a leg broken in the same
controversy. Ogilvie’s friends now be-
lieve that he will follow Lyons as P.M. —
though they don’t profess to believe in
omens.
Litigants will remember the late
Langer Owen, J., for his charming and
considerate manners ; he was that rare
and undefinable phenomenon a gentle-
man, A son of William Owen, also a
Supreme Court Judge and Senior Puisne
for many years, Langer Owen was edu-
cated at Charterhouse and New College,
Oxford. He was called to the London
Bar in 1888, and to the N. S. Wales Bar a
few months later. He made his name in
Equity, and was a success as Chief Judge
in Divorce, owing largely to his humanity
and knowledge of the world. When the
war began, though years over age, he
tried his best to enlist; failing, he gave
up his profession for the duration and es-
tablished the Information Bureau, which
is gratefully remembered by the relations
of Diggers. He retired two years ago,
but continued to work hard —as Royal
Commissioner (unpaid) to inquire into
performing rights in copyright work, as
president of the Bribery League and in
other capacities. He leaves a son, W. F.
L. Owen, who is a prominent junior, and
a daughter, Gladys Owen, the painter,
whose Red Cross work during the war
earned her an 0.8. E.
Lieut.-Commander Billyard-Leake, who
has married Betty Chester, the actress,
in Kenya, is an Australian who joined the
R.N. in 1908 and was here as a midship-
man on the original Australia. His
mother was a Sydney heiress whose
name is perpetuated in Billyard-avenue
and other thoroughfares of the Potts
Point sector. He got a D.S.O. and several
French decorations for his work at Zee-
brugge. Harefield, the family place near
London, was a military hospital through-
out the war.

tained in Sydney by the Fellowship of
Writers, gave Australian authors an en-
couraging item of news: “A tale about
Australia will now find as ready a
market —other things equal—as one
about any other country.”
Monsignor Peoples, parish priest of
Clovelly, who dropped dead at the wheel
of his car on Friday night shortly after
he had officiated at Benediction, was one
of the Australian-born products of the
college at Manly who seemed to have a
great future in the Church. His
mental energy was unbounded; in
addition to giving tireless attention to his
parish he was editor of the Australasian
“Catholic Directory,” a diocesan censor,
R.A.N. chaplain for Sydney, and an
active member of the archdiocesan coun-
cil of architecture. He played tennis, and
was as fit, to all appearances, as most
men of 45 when he died. Born in Syd-
ney he had four brothers, one of whom
is parish priest of Five Dock.
From an old pupil:
The stocky figure of Prof. Macmillan Brown,
clad invariably in a double-breasted suit of
blue serge, will be missed not only in Christ-
church (M.L.), where he lived for 60 years,
but all up and down the Pacific, for he spent
most of his vacations and a large slice of his
time after retirement in exploring out-of-the-way
islands. He was the first occupant of the
Classics chair at Canterbury College—a Scot
who had been to Edinburgh and Glasgow Uni-
versities and took his M.A. at Oxford. (He
was at Balliol in Jowett’s time, and frequently
met Matthew Arnold and Swinburne.) Though
trained as a classical scholar, he had won
scholarships in maths., and taught English,
history and pol. econ. The breakfasts at his
home, at which he entertained favorite students,
were a feature of life at Canterbury College 30
years ago. In addition to many textbooks on
English classics, the prof, was author (under a
nom de plume ) of a two-vol. work somewhat
after the style of Butler’s “Erewhon” in which
civilisation was unsparingly satirised. The
book might have had a better reception if its
authorship has been acknowledged. His wife
(they were childless) died 30 years ago, and
the old professor was 88 at the last milestone.
He was active to the end, and two days before
his death delivered a vigorous speech before the
Senate of M.L. University, as Chancellor, pro-
testing against retrenchment of expenditure on
education.
Though women’s cricket is now getting
Test publicity, no one seems to remember
the pioneer work of Millie Finkelstein,
the handsome sister of Phil Finkelstein,
of the J.C.W. co. In the ’nineties
it was not considered refined for ladies
to play cricket, but Millie went ahead
and contrived to turn out a very fair
team, and it laid the foundations of the
hundreds of clubs scattered over Austra-
lia to-day. Millie afterwards became the
wife of Pat Finn, son of “Garryowen,”
whose “Chronicles of Early Melbourne”
are being reprinted in a Melbourne daily.
“Jeames”: Lady Houston, who has got
into the cables again with a £2OOO dona-
tion to one of the Prince’s funds, is a
millionairess (she inherited the money of
the late Sir Robert Houston, whom she
married as widow of the ninth Lord
Byron), a super-loyalist and a super-
advertiser. She bought the “Saturday
Review” some years ago, and that once
highbrow weekly is now a sort of pub-
licity sheet for her and her enterprises.
The “New Statesman” periodically re-
prints such items as this from the “Satur-
day”;—
This is once again splendid of Lady
Houston. She is the Ace of Trumps.
England would be great if she were Prime
Minister.
She was a militant suffragette before the
war, and she is now a high Tory.
“Cosmos” on a Communist:
Bela Kun, whose trade commissioner
Matyas Rakosi has been arraigned at Buda-
pest on 44 charges of murder, was a type of
Communist whom civilised communities have
good cause to dread. A small, plump Jew,
he had a suave, smiling manner which made
his record hard to believe. He used to shoot
condemned prisoners for the love of it. His
regime as head of Hungary’s only Communist
Government proved, if it proved anything, that
whoever benefits by Communism it isn’t the
workers; they starved.
I met him in Paris in 1928, and was sur-
prised to find that he regarded his political ex-
periences as amusing. The complete irrespon-
sible. His refusal to take anything seriously
gives him a sort of charm. Continental
journalists say it has got him out of several
prisons, and enabled him to remain alive after
his colleagues had been executed.
Dave Robertson, of Melbourne, who
was by far the most impressive of the
Douglas Credit witnesses before the Tas-
manian Monetary Committee of Inquiry,
is a brother of Macpherson Robertson,
and himself a chocolate king. Like many
others who have risen in the business
world, Dave graduated through the
League of Wheelmen. He knows Doug-
las from A to Z, and has a rough, tough
but, withal, courteous way of handling
interjectors.

LIFE
AND HEALTH CHARTS
In average life, health is best
between 20 and 40. The
“turning point” or noticeable
downward slope begins, as a
rule, at the age of 40. With
care (especially of the kidneys
and bladder) this health line
can be extended, so that its
steepness does not become pro-
nounced until 50 or even later.
The life-line, too, may be ex-
tended ; 5, 1 o— or more —years
of life being gained by timely
attention to the symptoms of
disorder.
is often the turning point in health
••• guard Yourself against these insidious “After-40’
Ailments that attack about 65 in every 100 men and women . .
CCORDING to averages, you and I will
die at fifty-five— or very near to that
age. Had we been born in 1850, we
would have died at about thirty-five—again,
according to the Law of Averages. So, you
see. Life is being lengthened. In a hundred
years’ time the average age at death will prob-
ably be seventy —maybe older. Look at the
charts above. Notice the Life-and-Health-
lines. You will see that the turning point
comes at about 40 years of age —that is the
age when the strain of life generally begins to
tell. At about 40, the seldom-mentioned
disorder—prostate trouble—begins to cheat
men of virility; while kidney and bladder
break-down afflicts about 63 men and women
in every 100— though some may never know it !
Medical science now declares that 75% of
poisonous wastes and uric acid deposits from
the system is excreted by the kidneys—in much
too-concentrated a form. The delicate over-
burdened kidney cells
are unequal to the
excessive strain. Con-
gestion occurs, forc-
ing back into the
system the poisons
which should be ex-
pelled. Here begins
a succession of ills;
here is where health starts to decline threaten-
ingly. Crippling backache begins; pains down
the groins; swollen joints, limbs and feet;
dizziness; possibly severe inflammation of the
bladder and urinary tract; rheumatism, which,
in turn, may seriously affect the heart.
How to Prevent and Banish These
Menacing “After-40” Disorders.
First strengthen your kidneys and enable them
to cope with their work. For this purpose
there is no proprietary remedy to equal the
preparation offered under authority of Dr.
William Harrison, Member of the Royal
College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the
Royal College of Physicians; distinguished in
London medical practice. This remedy,
widely known as Harrison’s Pills, is com-
pounded to what is probably the most perfect
prescription for overcoming the cause of the
majority of old-age symptoms ever discovered.
Make Your Life and Health Lines
Curve More Gradually.
Though the average person dies at about 55,
there is no good reason why you should— if
you take special precautions.
Keep your kidneys in perfect health and
eliminate the harmful poisonous wastes as they
are formed—by taking Harrison’s Pills. If
you decide to take this remedy, prepare to
see some surprising changes in your health.
Notice the departure of constipation (in itself
a dread disorder) ; notice an improvement in
the clearness of your eyes and skin, and in
the lines around your eyes. Feel yourself
become a good ten years younger as
Harrison s Pills drive out the symptoms of
increasing age; bid farewell to your growing
sense of weariness and to your constantly re-
curring aches and pains. See your step take
on new elasticity; hear your friends remark at
the improvement in your general spirits and
bearing. Continue with this remedy, taking a
couple of the pills whenever there are indica-
tions of strain upon the kidneys, or signs of
bladder, uric acid or urinary trouble. Then
you may feel safe in the assumption that you
are taking effective steps to straighten out that
declining “life-line,” prolonging useful vigorous
activity, five, ten —even twenty years, and in
these added years of life, who knows what
marvels of rejuvenation science may devise?
Harrison’s Pills are obtainable from all high-
class prescription chemists in bottles of 18
pills, 2/-; 32 pills, 3/-; and 68 pills, 5/-. If
remote from a chemist, post your order to
Amalgamated Laboratories, Australia House,
Sydney. Satisfaction or refund of purchase
price is guaranteed with the very first bottle.

The figures in that table provide strong
evidence in support of Australia’s case
against restriction of her beef exports
to Britain. Since Europe turned to baby
beef from S. America, the story of the
run-owner outback in Queensland, where
uncertain rains, dry Mitchell grass, salt-
bush and gidya produce slow-maturing
beasts, has been one of lost markets,
falling prices and rigid costs. This co.
has not balanced on the right side since
1925. Including the writing-down of pro-
perties and livestock (it was mainly re-
sponsible for the big loss in 1932) and
£77,176 of accrued pref. divs., losses over
the last nine years aggregate £313,809,
leaving the deficit on shareholders’ ac-
count at £309,578, and others have fared
worse than that.
There is £325,597 of share capital in
107,249 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and 218,330
ords. It was proposed to write off the
whole of the ord. capital, cancel arrears
of pref, divs., convert existing pref.
shares into ords., and issue £70,000 of
new 5 p.c. prefs. in satisfaction of a debt
to the Q.M.E. of a like amount. But
the co.’s memorandum stood in the way
of sanction by the Court, and there the
matter stands for the present. Exclud-
ing accrued divs., the whole of the ord.
and £14,071 of the pref. capital were un-
represented by tangibles when the books
closed.
Last year- Nature was kind, but the
market for beef was stubborn, wool
prices tumbled, and the co. finished up
with a trading loss of £1967.
What the future holds for the business
largely depends upon (1) seasons, (2)
terms of the long-term beef contract with
Britain, (3) development of the chilled-
beef trade, (4) prices and (5) adjustment
of Crown rentals on the basis of values
in the Smithfield (Eng.) market, where
the beef is sold.

Since this little offshoot of the well-
established Mercantile Mutual pulled out
of the troublesome London marine
market—adverse results there were re-
sponsible for the loss in 1933—the loss
ratio has been the lightest since the co.
began to write policies direct with the
public about nine years ago. Last year
an extra £2560 of net premiums was
gathered at an additional cost of £3142 ;
branches were opened at Hobart and
Perth in the previous term:

Claims took £4 4s. less of each £lOO of
net premiums, leaving the underwriting
surplus £1179 better at £5948. Invest-
ments turned in £6082, up £2ll. There
was thus enough to show 17.1 p.c. on
capital as against 13.3, 11.6, a loss, 9.3,
25.3 and 26.9 p.c. back to 1928. The
div. was kept at 8 p.c,, which was more
than covered by the return from invest-
ments alone, leaving the balance and the
whole of the underwriting surplus avail-
able to swell investments and returns
therefrom.
The market prices the pound shares
paid to 7s. at 16s. 2d. as against Bs. 9d.
two years ago. The return at 16s. 2d. is
3.4 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis ; the in-
vestor who looks for 4.3 p.c. on his
money counts on the div. reaching 10 p.c.
The cover is 13s, Id. in net tangibles.

When the books closed, policy-holders

p.c. is usually considered adequate, and
shareholders can be called upon to dredge
up a further £130,000 if required.

The £225,000 of share capital is in
62,755 p.c, cum. prefs. (less 21\ p.c.
statutory cut) and 162,225 ords. When
the books last closed there was ss. per
share (£15,920) coming to the prefs. in
accrued divs. Prospects of their getting
into the picture again are much brighter
than the last line in the table suggests,
but it is difficult to say exactly where the
ords. stand at the moment.
It used to be the Australian Drug Co.,
Sydney, a steady 10-percenter for 17
years to the close of accounts in 1929.
In Aug., 1930, it merged its main trad-
ing interests with 11 other drug concerns
in one big holding co., Drug Houses of
Australia, for £169,026 in scrip, and the
name was changed to the present title.
Other assets consisted of three freeholds
and a handful of book debts, etc. The
properties comprised Australia House,
Carrington-street (it was built, with
plenty of letting space, when prices were
at their top), the York-street factory and
Charles-street garage, the lot subject to
an overdraft of £160,000. Slump upset
calculations, the properties proved to be
a drag, and divs. from Drug Houses
have been moderate.
During the last term the York-street
premises were sold for £21,000 cash, the
loss on the deal being £26,550. That
enabled £18,658 net to be snipped off the
outside debt, mainly the overdraft: —•

Freeholds figure at cost, which is in
excess of present market values. When
a buyer can be found, the garage is to
be sold and the overdraft further re-
duced, It has been lowered to £99,000
by the sale of 39,400 Drug Houses shares
for £41,000-odd since the close of
accounts.
Last year’s trading loss of £2472 was
due to a slip of £BO6B in revenue
(£11,857), following termination of the
D.H.A. leases on June 30, 1933. Exes.
(£14,329, of which £8256 was for in-
terest) were only £1877 lighter.
The reduction of the overdraft and.
of the rate of interest thereon from 5
p.c. to 4i p.c., together with a bit better
demand for letting space, should bring
receipts and expenditure in connection
with freeholds more into line, and Drug
Houses, which paid 3 i p.c. last year
(only \\ p.c. of it had been received by
this Investment co. at June 30 last) as
against \\ p.c. in 1933, is expected to
send along a little more during the cur-
rent term. Assuming that the property
earns enough to cover its own keep and
that Drug Houses pays 5 p.c., this Invest-
ment co. would net £6481.
The market notes the arrears of pref.
divs., and prices the pound ords. at 11s.
The prefs. at 245. 3d. return 4.7 p.c., plus
arrears. The book value of the net tan-
gible cover is £3 11s. lid. prefs. and 18s.

This snug concern has been carrying
passengers and cargo between Sydney
and Newcastle since the end of 1891,
when it was formed to weld the interests
of the old Hunter River and Newcastle
S.S. cos. Establishment of steel and
other works at Newcastle helped to swell
earnings, despite rail and road competi-
tion. For the dozen years to the close of
accounts in 1929 a steady 10 p.c. was
paid, sweetened with £20,000 of bonus
scrip in 1920. Then slump and the sick-
ness in the coal trade gave earnings a jolt,
and the div. dropped to 5 p.c. in 1931.
It has since continued on the up-grade,
thanks largely to the commencement of
wool sales and the revival of industrial
activity at Newcastle.
“Trade showed improvement” is the
board’s laconic comment on last year’s
operations. The profit claimed was
£12,034, or £1520 more than for the
previous year. That was after £16,037
(£3326 in the previous term) dropped
from somewhere into reserves. The
“Wild Cat” believes this to be genuine
profit and has treated it accordingly.
There was thus enough to show 18.7 p.c.
on capital as against 9.2, 11.4, 5.7, 6.3,
14.2 and 21.7 p.c. back to 1928. The div.
was lifted a point, raising it to 8 p.c. At
the moment prospects are that the co.
will enjoy another good year.
Over the twelvemonth the market
lengthened its bid for the pound shares,
covered by 465. 2d. in net tangibles, from
365. to 41s. 6d. The return at 41s. 6d. is
3.8 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis, or 4.3 p.c.
on a 9 p.c. distribution..
When the books closed shareholders
could see all but £8371 of their capital in
Consols and cash, up £21,621-during the
year;—

When it comes to a pinch the ord.
shareholders, who usually control the
business, can be relied upon to put up
a hard fight to preserve as much of their
capital and prospects of a reasonable re-
turn thereon as possible, though it means
modification of the prefs.’ rights or even
the writing-down of pref. capital. Slump
brought of loan funds on
public works up v/ith a jerk, and left
this co. heavily overcapitalised. Share-
holders’ funds were mostly represented
by quarries and plant; so £209,848 was
struck off the book value of these assets,
leaving £151,309 (= 11s. per ord. share)
of the capital unrepresented by tangibles.
To clean the slate the board suggested
that half* the capital (pref. and ord.
combined) be jettisoned, and that
the 10 p.c. cum. pref. div. be re-
duced to 5 p.c. non-cumulative, with
the right to advance beyond that
point with the ords. This amounted
to an abrogation of pref. rights for the
benefit of the ords., and the proposal
was rejected. After a long struggle,
agreement has been reached whereby
the pref. div. (arrears have been cancelled)
has been reduced to a cumulative 5 p.c.,
with the right to advance point for point
with the ords. on a, share basis after the
latter have had 9 p.c. For the participat-
ing rights to be worth anything the co.
will need to net over £15,598.
After setting aside £3OOO for the tax-
gatherer and £7287 for depreciation,
£10,457 was netted last year, thanks to
the revival of building and other construc-
tion work. That reduced the deficit on
ord. capital to £3349 ; no divs. were paid.
The £10,457 was enough to give the
prefs. their 5 p.c. (£3220) and then show
5.3 p.c. on ord. capital.
It is a speculative investment. Still,
the market, which expects the co. to do
better during the current term, prices
the fully-paid 10s. ords. at 10s. 3d. The
return at that figure would be 5.8 p.c.

on an 8 p.c. div. basis, or 3.3 p.c. on a
9 p.c. distribution. The net tangible
cover is 10s. 6d. per share.
During the last term the value of trusts
wound up exceeded those put on the
books by £78,697. Still, other figures
moved in the right direction:

The reduction in exes, was due to a
lighter tax bill (£2620, down £892).
Allowing for the amount written off and
the contribution to the staff fund, enough
remained to show 10.4 p.c. on the
£lOO,OOO of paid capital as against 8.1,
8.4, 10.2, 15.2, 15.8 and 17.7 p.c. back
to 1928. The slip in the 1933 figure was
due entirely to an unexplained reduction
of £l7Bl in reserves, which may have
had some connection wtih the co. taking
over another floor in its own building.
The assets consist of freehold, etc.,
£74,583 ; safe deposit, £11,321 ; Consols,
£89,327 ; loans, etc., £32,432 ; cash, etc.,
£7707. There was £2ll coming to
outsiders. After paying the final div.
(£4000), that lot need turn in only 3.7
p.c. to show 8 p.c. on capital alone.
That leaves earnings from the trust busi-
ness out of the reckoning altogether, and
these can be expected to improve as the
volume of trusts grows.
For 11 years to the close of accounts
in 1929 the div. was kept at 12 p.c., and
paid capital advanced from £24,130 to
its present figure by par issues, which
were in the nature of handsome bonuses
to shareholders, the scrip commanding a
high premium in the market. With the
change in conditions, the div. dropped to
8 p.c., and thus far it has remained there.
The luckless Lasseter went looking for
his “lost reef” in Centralia, and died
there. His body was covered with
grass, etc., by friendly natives, and sub-
sequently buried by Bob Buck, who
brought back his papers and other relics.
Now one S. R. Hummerston claims to
have discovered “Lasseter’s lost reef.”
Briefly, the story is that Hummer-
ston, while prospecting in Centralia,
had occasion to deviate towards
Oodnadatta for supplies. On the way
he was surprised to find an inscription
“Dig in campfire” cut on a tree. Obeying
the injunction he states that he found
a map and several sealed letters in a
bottle. Incidentally, it has not been
made clear whether the map and the
letters were deposited there by Lasseter,
who was buried about 200 miles away.
However, according to Hummerston, the
map gave the location of a gold-bearing
reef which proved to be three-quarters
of a mile long, with an average width of
about 30in. After pegging the ground, he
returned to Sydney, where Border Gold
Reefs, Ltd., was recently formed to ex-
ploit the field. A small expedition, headed
by Hummerston, has set out for Hum-
merston’s reef. Barrels of money have
already been lost in looking for Las-
seter’s.

During the last few weeks Mt. Lawson
Prospecting and Option Syndicate’s
shares shot up £BO, reaching £llO. The
rocketing was the outcome of a favor-
able report on the co.’s New Guinea
properties by Mr. McClelland, followed
by the board’s decision to form a co.

sists of about 300 acres of flats, running
for some eight or nine miles along the
Upper Watut above its junction with Sur-
prise Creek and on the opposite side of
the mountain to Bulolo Gold Dredging.
Approximately 2,000,000 c.y., estimated
to average 25., has been proved by
shallow pitting; the average depth of
the wash is put at 15ft. The deposit is to
be treated by sluicing, and a hydro-
electric plant is to be installed. The
new co., Upper Watut Alluvials, will
have a nominal capital of £200,000 in ss.
shares, of which 320 paids, plus £lO cash,
will be handed out for each Syndicate
share, which also carries the right to

New Occidental, Cobar (N.S.W.), pro-
poses to issue 165,000 new ss. shares,
one for four, at par. When all the cash
is in, paid capital will be £203,125. The
extra money is wanted to finance further
development and to increase plant capa-
city to 9000 tons a month. The idea is
to swell ore reserves (now 316,000 tons
of Bdwt. to 9dwt. stone), reduce unit costs
and leave the road open for divs. The
shaft, which has been sunk from 740 ft.
to 840 ft., is to be deepened another
200 ft., with levels at 940 ft. and 1040 ft.
At 840 ff. the lode is 63ft. wide, averag-
ing 8.47dwt.; omitting 3ft. on each side
the average value is 9.29dwt. The open-
ing up of this level alone is expected to
add 120,000 tons to reserves ; it is antici-
pated that a strong make of stone will
be met with on the bottom level.
Accounts show cash £29,309 and stores
£17,171. Creditors figure for £6374.

Mutooroo Copper and a number
of other Adelaide concerns, including
Associated Gold, Hansel-Munday’s Gold,
Hannan’s West Silver Lead and the
Midas, have pegged claims at Batlow
(N.S.W.). Mutooroo’s option covers
a formation known as Walsh’s Dyke,
about 100 ft, wide. Samples taken
50ft. from the mouth of a tunnel
in this dyke assayed Bdwt. to lOdwt. of
gold. It cannot be said that values
extend over the whole width of the
formation, or that it runs for any con-
siderable length, says V. Farrier, Chief
Inspector of Mines in N. S. Wales, who
recently visited the area. Much of the
ground was pegged on the assumption
that the dyke does extend in length.
Now leaseholders have been told by the
Government to construct adequate set-
tling dams to prevent any of the sluiced
material polluting Adelong Creek. The
real difficulty in the way of sluicing will
be to prevent the overflow from one
claim passing over another. Unless
satisfactory arrangements in this respect
are made by adjoining holders, it h diffi-
cult to see how some of the ground can
be worked by sluicing.

The outlook at Mt. Charlested wol-
fram mines, Frogmore (N.S.W.), has
been further brightened by the discovery
of a vein, worked prior to 1920, under
the old shaft. This will “considerably”
increase known supplies of ore, and the
wolfram content is above the average.
The co. can produce at a profit with
wolfram at 14s. a unit in London. There
the price soared from 275. early in ’34
to over 40s. before Christmas, and is
now around 38s. 6d.

Operations at Moonta (S. Aus.) ceased
some months ago, owing to the low price
of the red metal. The Commonwealth
and State Governments had put up a
small flotation plant to treat stone from
shallow workings. Recently the State
authorities suggested a scheme of weekly
advances in lieu of wages, the advance
to be supplemented when concentrates
were realised. With a production of 27
tons of concentrates a v/eek, and copper
at £2B to £3O a ton, the advance was to
be £1 per week, or £1 16s. if the price
of the metal was £32-£34 a ton. The
men asked for a flat £2 a week instead
of the sliding scale, and work has been
resumed on this basis, thanks to the
special Commonwealth grant. With the
metal at £35 per ton the scheme will
become self-supporting.

“Belle of the ’Nineties”
This melodrama at Sydney Prince
Edward has an exciting plot. The period
is supposed to be 1892-93. Mae West
portrays a contemporary danseuse —an-
other Yvette Guilbert or Anna Held.
All the men are after her. John Miljean
is a ruined gambler who stages a high-
way robbery and steals a necklace which
has been given to the heroine by another
lover. She resteals it in thrilling circum-
stances, and the finish finds her in the
arms of a pug (Roger Pryor) who has
been what the French call her fatal man
from the first.
“Belle of the ’Nineties” is yet another
of those Hollywood productions where
ignorance of the period is bliss for the
spectator. Many of the men wear Hom-
burg hats, as they were known when the
then Prince of Wales introduced them to
the West End of London at the begin-
ning of this century. Felts didn’t sup-
plant bowlers and straws in the U.S.A.
till years later. All the males, barring
Miljean (who gives a realistic portrait of
a middle-aged man of the ’nineties) and
a few other principals, wear collars which
were still in the womb of Time. There
are automatic telephones, though people
were ringing up in parts of America as
recently as ten years ago. And there is
an up-to-the-minute jazz band!
The heroine is the most flagrant' anach-
ronism of all. As often as Miljean and
one or two more create something of a
nineteenth-century illusion Mae West
ruins it. The modernist songs which she
yowls and whoops are right out of the
picture; but her formula is evidently as
rigid as it is simple. As Nell Gwynne, as
Joan of Arc, as Lady Macbeth, she would
exploit the same eye work, the same
strut', the same nasal ululations about her
sex life, to the accompaniment of some-
body like Duke Ellington and his
exuberant niggers.
“Limehouse Blues”
Also at the Prince Edward. George
Raft —the same dressy, imperturbable
and slightly sinister George Raft of in-
numerable Hollywood gangsters—is an
Anglo-Chinese drug-runner. Jean Parker
—the same soft-voiced, dewy-eyed
American virgin of innumerable Holly-
Kay Francis in “British Agent,” at
Sydney Regent.
wood romances —is a Cockney pick-
pocket. Raft has a way of lending people
he doesn’t like the key of his gorgeous
Limehouse flat; when they use the key
they are assassinated. Miss Parker falls
in love with a beautiful young Caucasian
who runs an animal-shop. Imagine her
feelings when she realises that Raft has
given her idol the fatal key. Anna May
Wong comes into it as Raft’s jealous
mistress; also a number of highly un-
convincing Scotland Yard chiefs, one of
whom shoots Raft with a machine-gun.
The best features of a somewhat wit-
less effort are the picturesque settings
and the photography. Unfortunately for
aestheticism, they depict a Limehouse
which doesn’t exist. In fancy the writer
can see its grim streets, each flat little
house a replica of the next, and a crowd
of Jew shopkeepers, Russian sailors
and British deckhands drifting through
the rain to hear Harry Pollitt speak in
the Town Hall. There wasn’t a half-
Joe E. Brown in “Six-Day Bike Rider,”

caste Chinese in expensive New York
clothes or a wistful flapper with her dark
hair hanging down her back .in the
gathering. Dulness is the outstanding
characteristic of Limehouse. “Lime-
house Blues,” which is an American pro-
duction, tends to make one who knows
the East End of London wonder if any
slum on earth is half so romantic as
Hollywood makes out.
“A Lost Lady”
This is a parable that owes not a little
to William J. Locke and is enacted prin-
cipally by Frank Morgan and Barbara
Stanwyck.
There lived in a Great City a Wealthy
Young Lady who was Happily Betrothed
to a Beautiful Young Gentleman. He
was as False as he was Fair. On the
Eve of the Nuptials there appeared a
Mysterious Stranger, Conversant with
the Goings-On of the 8.Y.G., who out
with a Gat and Plugged Him (the
8.Y.G.). Thereafter the Young Lady was
as One Dead. They took her to an
Exclusive Mountain Resort, where she
Wandered Round Dizzily (as a Dizzy
Wanderer Miss Stanwyck is beyond com-
pare). She fell into an Irregularity in the
Landscape, where she Sprained an Ankle.
A Great Corporation Lawyer Beyond
the Age of Romance (with his Corpora-
tion Restrained so You Wouldn’t Notice
It) Discovered Her while out Hunting
Butterflies with his Faithful Hound. He
Married Her, Knowing Full Well it was
a Dam Risky Experiment. His Prescience
was Justified. A Dashing Young Aviator
(Ricardo Cortez) Stole His Wife’s Love.
But after the Corporation Lawyer had Sat
for Days Hating Her, and caressing his
Faithful Hound while she Drank Brandy
and grew Distraught (her distraught con-
dition being expressed by furious explora-
tion of her thick and beautifully sham-
pooed hair), Real Love Dawned and the
Romantic Couple pledged Eternal
Fidelity in a Long, Long Kiss,
Sydney Capitol, long famous for, its
star-lit ceiling, and now exhibiting fleecy
clouds, harbors this opus. George M.
Cohan’s performance in “Gambling,”
which The Bulletin has already re-
viewed, outweighs “Lost Lady” by about
40,000 tons, but the best thing on the
bill is a cartooned report of the historic
conference in which the mice decided to
bell the cat.
“Mister Cinders”
At the State. The male Cinderella of
this light but pleasing English comedy is
Jim Lancaster (Clifford Mollison), whose
clowning is quiet and easy. Clifford does
all the unenviable tasks in his uncle’s
mansion while two pampered cousins,
Guy and Lumley (the Western brothers),
loaf. The Fairy Godmother is Jill Kemp
(Zelma O’Neal), the breezy daughter of
an American millionaire. Jim fishes the
American out of a stream, but the
cousins get the credit and invitations
to a fancy-dress ball. Jim turns up un-
invited in a suit of armor. What with
Jim’s attempt to pass himself off as a
famous explorer, a jewel robbery and a
performance of “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream” by the village amateur theatrical
society, there are sufficient hilarious situ-
ations to satisfy the average talkie-fan.
There are some tuneful songs, and the
outdoor photography is a joy.
“Anne of Green Gables”
This celluloid version of L. M. Mont-
gomery’s classic for schoolgirls is rather
less sentimental than “Little Women.”
Anne Shirley, who plays the orphan girl,
is only 16, yet she handles her chief
situations —the long ride to the farm, the
false confession of theft, the interview
with the school-teacher —like an old hand.
Another juvenile who scores is Tom
Brown, Anne’s youthful admirer. O. P.
Heggie is fine as the benevolent farmer ;
so is Helen Westley as Manila, the
spinster who hides a sympathetic soul
behind her brusque exterior.
Laurel and Hardy
This week the Civic plumps hard for
melodrama ; there are three murders, a
burglary and a hypnotist who exercises
his power to attract women. Also there’s
a Laurel and Hardy, and Saturday night’s
audience seemed to like it best.
“Tangled Evidence”
Has two of the murders and the
burglary. Scotland Yard has charge of
the case —it takes place in an English
country home —and duly solves it. Act-
ing :is capable. Michael Hogan is suffi-
ciently self-satisfied as a successful, novel-
ist, and most of the others —Sam Livesey
(of the Yard) and Joan Marion in parti-
cular —fit in well.
“The Love Captive”
Introduces the amorous hypnotist and
the other murder. Nils Asther is a
O. P. Heggie in Anne of Green
Gables,” at Sydney State.
N, York quack who cures dipsomaniacs
by hypnosis. Later he goes in for hyp-
notising his nurses, and the young doctor-
fianc£ of one of them has his conduct
investigated by the American equivalent
of the B.M.A. Asther gets all the sym-
pathy, but he’s a corpse at the finish.
Some First Nights
The Fuller opera co.’s first Sydney
performance of Gounod’s “Faust” was
principally .remarkable for the fact that
it was Welshmen’s night at the New Tiv.
and that Ben Williams, who played Dr.
Faustus, was produced for acclamation
on the ground that he is one of the sons
Helen Westley in “Anne of Green
Gables.”
of Gwalia. The Welsh national anthem
preluded the opera, which was produced
with second conductor, second tenor,
second soprano and second or third con-
tralto. However, the company went
through with it, and found next day that,
according to one newspaper critic, the
exposition demonstrated Gounod’s in-
feriority to both Wagner and Verdi in
the matter of orchestration, and that,
according to another, the opera “descends
into banal tunefulness.”
Nevertheless, the audience was gen-
erous with applause—so generous that it
sometimes drowned singers and orchestra.
There seemed to be no particular reason
why action —which in these cases consists
of a few machine-made gestures —should
be pressed on relentlessly in the case of
an opera so regularly compartmented into
arias and choruses as “Faust” is, but the
conductor, possibly with an eye on rail-
way timetables, pushed on. Thea Philips
as Marguerita, Ben Williams as Dr. Faust
and Horace Stevens as Mephistopheles
were the principal voices. All have been
heard to better advantage in other operas,
but a long season takes its toll.
H- * *
The American comedy “Smiling,
Obliging and Polite,” Sydney Kursaal
Theatre’s latest production, is character-
ised by a measure of character-limning
and a moral not usually associated with
this sort of play. Youthful enthusiasm
opposes cynical experience in business.
Scott Alexander (producer also) scored in
the principal role, that of a manufacturer,
and Harry MacDonald gave an effective
representation of impulsive youth. Sub-
sidiary parts were capably filled.
w * *
“And So to Bed,” by J. B. Fagan, a
peep into eight hours of the life of
Pepys, was Sydney Independents’ first
essay in 1935. It kept the first-night audi-
ence chuckling. The pompous little
Samuel is shown as a genial host,
a slave to duty, a lover of music
and an ardent admirer of the fair
sex. Three well-constructed acts record
Samuel’s rescue of a charming widow
from the hands of a ruffian and his sub-
sequent pursuit of the lady, which in-
volved him in all manner of trouble with
his wife and King Charles ll.—both had
good reasons for jealousy. The dialogue
is racy. As Pepys, Albert Collins radia-
ated good-fellowship, was a soft-tongued
if somewhat clumsy philanderer, comi-
cally abject when the King discovered
him in the widow’s drawing-room. Freda
McGhee as the diarist’s wife, Clarence
Murphy as Charles 11. and Norah Caza-
bon as the widow contributed to the suc-
cess of the performance. Doris Fitton
produced the show, Don Finley designed
the scenery, and Ethel Gabriel and
Stanley Hildebrand t were responsible for
the very effective costumes.

WIRELESS MANUFACTURING
PROGRESS IN AUSTRALIA
The manufacture of wireless equipment in Australia has attained a
very high degree of efficiency. Every type of apparatus for use at sea,
on land and in the air is now produced at the A.W.A. Radio-Electric
Works.
During the past year the Company broke many production records, not
the least being that in respect of Radiola broadcast receivers, the
manufacture of which exceeded previous records by 33%.
Powerful 10,000 watt high-fidelity transmitters were manufactured for
the New Zealand Broadcasting Board’s Station 1YA Auckland and
3YA Christchurch; as well as a high-fidelity transmitter and studio
equipment for Station 2UW Sydney. The A.W.A. Works also manu-
factured several other powerful high-fidelity broadcast transmitters.
A large number of ships of the Australasian Mercantile Marine were
equipped with marine wireless transmitters, and several ships fitted with
direction finding apparatus.
Twenty-five transmitters were produced for use in the interior of New
Guinea, Fiji and Australia.
A number of transmitters and receivers, specially designed for aircraft
working, were manufactured by A.W.A. during the year.
With its highly qualified and experienced staff of radio engineers,
coupled with its modern manufacturing resources, A.W.A. manu-
factures every type of wireless equipment for use in its Overseas Com-
munication Services, Australian Coastal Radio, Pacific Islands,
Marine Services and Broadcasting. The Australian wireless industry
is thus wholly self-contained.

and given over off the S’African coast.
An unusually large and ferocious horde
of hungry locusts, officers and crew
driven below under hatches and forced
to abandon the conduct of the ship—

“Canopus”: “Rindy’s” magpie (B.
21/11/’34) polished off a meal of 21 mice!
His must be the most amazing bird of
the species. They generally rely on get-
ting enough vitamins from spiders,
beetles and various small insects, and are
poor meat-eaters. I am prepared to
stake a dollar’s worth of the best that
“Rindy” can’t find another magpie that
will eat a mouse alive, dead, cooked or
raw. The one he talks of must have
been crossed with a pelican.

“Cooloothin”; Brian Benton, in
“Landtakers”: “He wore a waistcoat
without a coat, a kind of dress that
always makes a man appear a scoundrel.”
I wouldn’t call the appearance of drapers’
clerks, who habitually adopt this outfit,
as “scoundrelish,” although they may
deserve other epithets. The effect of
villainy, is only obtained by wearing
waistcoat and trousers of contrasting
shades, as anyone who patronises “West-
ern” pictures can affirm. Anyway, it is
rather a libel on an exceedingly useful gar-
ment. Nothing has been invented to equal
it for convenience in carrying tobacco,
knife and matches when one is in a sit-
“Notaden”: A Mooloolah (Q.) man
has decided that in future he’s going to
treat dingoes as dingoes. In December,
1932, they made away with a sheep he’d
fattened for Christmas. In December,
1933, they repeated the insult. Early in
1934 he got a dog with poison, and
watched the bait with a rifle. Deceased’s
mate arrived with two pups, who sniffed
round the poisoned beef until she gave
them both a hiding and drove them
away. Touched by her intelligence and
maternal devotion, he did not shoot.
They showed their gratitude by stealing
the turkey which his wife was fattening
for Christmas, 1934, and on New Year’s
Eve returned for four young roosters
intended for a family gathering next
day. The Mooloolah man, now desti-
tute of sentiment, except of the most
hostile nature, in respect of dingoes, in-
tends to keep his 1935 Christmas-dinner
material in a securely fastened dingo-
proof enclosure surrounded by traps and
poisoned baits.

“Kali”; Some fellows have ingenious
ways of keeping off the dole. I saw two
men with buckets and kitchen-strainers
busy on the rocks at La Perouse. Found
they were collecting the larvje of the
mosquito from the many stagnant rock
pools, and the buckets must have con-
tained billions of wrigglers. They were
sold to goldfish dealers as fish-food.

“Walkabout”: Larry, after completing
a big fencing job, thought he’d better get
a new suit before starting on his bender.
“What kind of pockets do you want?”

“Doutta Galla”: “Tiger-cats and native-
cats” have been declared protected game
throughout Victoria. This shows how
the indigenous fauna has suffered
during the lifetime of middle-aged men.
Only a few years back farmers living
within a few miles of big towns were
unable to keep fowls owing to the depre-
dations of native-cats. Even to-day a
drive through near-country areas shows,
around the homesteads, tree-trunks bear-
ing a band of tin over which the cats
could not clamber to kill the perched
chooks. Nature-lovers may console them-
selves by reflecting that it does not take
long for animals to breed up. In the
Fitzroy Gardens, Melb., it is found
necessary every few years to clear out
the ’possums to save the flower-beds.

“Brassbound”: Few folk realise the
burden the grasshopper can be. The
man who is not trying to wrest a living
from the land isn’t interested, and lets it
go at that. Have just heard of a
S’African happening which should give
these indifferent ones pause. Passing
down the Natal coast, the Union Castle
liner Llangibby Castle was overwhelmed
by a storm of locusts, close cousins of
the ’hopper. These swarmed all over
the ship and began to eat the rigging,
or, at least, that part of it which wasn’t
steel wire. The possible fate of the boat-
falls, which were of hemp, caused great
anxiety, and the awnings also claimed
attention. All day long every can on

“G.M.”; Down in The Morass, a few
miles out of Orbost (Gippsland) there
are probably more snakes to the square
yard than anywhere else in Australia.
The whole surface of that swampy area
simply squirms as you approach it,
though it must be admitted that few
people do approach it; even the local
residents generally move the other way.
One man who does venture in is “Dusty”
Willis, who stalks the reptiles from
horseback with a stockwhip. “Dusty”
never misses. He can cut in halves a
moderately-sized tiger or black, but the
large ones are just stunned with the flick
of the lash. Then “Dusty” hops off to
complete the job with the handle of the
whip and returns to the more artistic
part of the sport. But there are so many
snakes that it has ceased to be a sport
with “Dusty,” and he is bored except
when a visitor comes from Melbourne
and asks for a demonstration. He has
no rival as a snake-slaughterer, except in
his horse Pompey —called after the late
General “Pompey” Elliott —who differs
from most prads in not fearing wrigglers,
and who takes a devilish delight in jump-
ing on ’em when they rear up their heads
to strike. Pompey has accounted for
over 200 himself, if local Aboliars are to
be believed.

“Runa”: 1 doubt if the water-rat can
beat the ordinary seagull (B. 9/1 /’35) as
a purloiner of fishing spoils. Those that
frequent harbors soon lose their fear of
man, particularly round the M.L. coast,
where several varieties are protected by
law. Fishing from the rocks in Auckland
Harbor one afternon, we were soon the
centre of attraction for a dozen gulls,
and only extreme vigilance made baiting
possible ; birds snatched the meat from
our hands. The capture of the first fish
brought raucous cries of approval, and
half a dozen birds invaded the small pool
in which we had placed the catch. After
that the flock took to following the fish
as it was drawn ashore, and tried their
prowess at seizing it in mid-air. The
afternoon’s entertainment was brought to
a conclusion by the baiting, quite acci-
dentally, of an astonished gull, where-
upon the company suddenly withdrew in
indignant silence.

“Matalau-Matalia”: “Kaa-pai” errs
loud and long when he asserts (B.
26 /12 / ’34) that the mbalolo (palolo in
N.G.) is like Father Christmas, and
appears but once a year in the Fijis. In
those isles, as well as in New Guinea, the
spaghetti-like exudation from coral reefs
makes a surface appearance twice annu-
ally. The first and less profuse rise is
called mbalolo lailai by the Fijians, while
the main yield about two weeks later is
referred to as mbalolo leva; “small” and
“great.” “Kaa-pai” also misinforms when
he states that the Fiji palolo is always
restricted to the thin and dark-green
variety P. viridis. According to my
observations, the grey, brown and dull-
red worms of which he speaks were just
as much in evidence as any other brand.
Coastal Fijians go for the slimy stuff
as flappers lap up ice-cream sundaes.
The reef fish also tear into it when
available.

“Hereward”: Out with a camping
party on the coast below Russell Heads
(N.Q.), I came to a spot where Bram-
stone Creek should have entered the sea.
The creek was dammed up by a high
sandbank, formed by a king tide, and
a great lagoon had formed. It being
low tide, the water was 7ft. or Bft. above
sea level, so with a piece of driftwood
I made a shallow channel from lagoon
to sea. Immediately it began to trickle ;
in a few minutes the sand was on the
move, and a stream, steadily increasing,
poured out. I noticed a number of
dusky bodies going out with the rush.
Crocodiles. Big and little, they were
escaping to the sea in dozens. Three
huge brutes came down more slowly,
and one tried to scramble out near to
where I stood. I shot, and he reared
head and shoulders out of the stream
and bellowed. My second shot hit him
in the side, but he just slipped off and
disappeared. I was on the wrong side
of the torrent, and it was four hours
after I started it before I was able to
cross, even then with water up to my
knees. I made good time, for it was
getting dusk, and there were too many
crocs, in the neighborhood. My
retriever, a wise hound and experienced,
went over like a streak of black light-
ning.

“Bondi-ite”: So far there has been
only one death from shark attack re-
corded in the century of Melbourne’s
existence, though the Hobson Bay sharks
are leviathans compared with those of
northern waters. Most of the Sydney
victims were savaged by six- or seven-
footers. The Hobson’s Bay variety
resembles a small whale. Five years
ago I saw one brought alive to Sor-
rento pier, where it died some hours
later. It measured 17 feet from stem
to stern. But even this was a baby com-
pared with the stuffed exhibit which
hangs in the museum in Swanston-
street; it spreads over half the roof
area of a big hall. Possibly the size of
these sharks keeps them in deep water
where bathers don’t venture.
“Black Bonnet”: Touching the notion
that sharks don’t live in fresh water.
A Herberton (N.Q.) man, fishing in the
Mitchell River, 10 miles below Mt. Mul-
grave station and 150 from the sea,
hooked on a night line a 4ft. shark.
“Double Dee”: The Jonah-and-fhe-
whale stunt was recently enacted on a
minor scale on the Westralian coast,
near Carnarvon. Two fishermen hooked
and landed a 12ft. grey nurse. Contents
consisted principally of a large turtle,
swallowed whole. Thinking this to be
long since defunct, they tossed it into
the shallow water near the beach. A
few minutes later the undigested meal
gave several spasmodic flips, and swam
uncertainly away.
“C.C.D.”: Buka hats (B. 2/1/’*3s) are
not conical; they are bulbous, and are
made of pandanus palm, not reeds. They
are worn, not at and after mar-
riage to keep the bridegroom’s
hair invisible, but in some cere-
monial connected with puberty
and the saving up of sufficient
property to allow of the father
giving a feast. Last year a
party of us in New Guinea tried
to get the true story from the
natives, but their yarns didn’t
ring true. Marys are a matter of pur-
chase, and marriage as we understand it
does not exist.

“Varanus”: I wouldn’t have dared to
make the statement unsupported; but
I’ll back “Airline” (B. 26/12/’34) in his
statement that goannas use trees as the
other ends of battering-rams to force
meals down their throats. I’ve seen an
old go. with the shankbone of a sheep
half-swallowed. Gulp as he would, the
darn thing wouldn’t go down another
inch. What did he do? Just picked
a suitable tree, stepped back the re-
quisite distance and charged. Another
go. took three charges before he had his
meal stowed comfortably and out of
sight.
* * * *
“Bondi-ite”: Swimming in the Yarra
near Kangaroo Ground, a woman
was bitten twice by a tiger snake which
wanted the bath to itself. The bites
had no serious effects, thanks to prompt
treatment. The first fatality from snake-
bite in the water has, I fancy, yet to be
recorded. So far, nobody has been bitten
by a sea snake, and the records tell of
only three or four having been captured
in Eastern Australian waters. Yet Port
Phillip contains many amphibious rep-
tiles which —well, if they aren’t snakes, I
don’t know what they are. Generally
about a foot or 15in. long, about as thick
as a pencil, and of a yellowish-green
translucency, in shape they are identical
with the land snake. They are common
around Sorrento in water a few inches
deep, and when disturbed will burrow
under the sand and hide. Sorrento
fishermen assure me that they fre-
quently haul them in the nets, and, know-
ing nothing of the venomous sea snake
further north, have no fear of them; no
record exists of anybody having been
bitten, let alone poisoned. I tried to
“place” these reptiles at the museum, but
there is nothing in the collection re-
sembling them.
SIXTY-ONE.
Oh! we are sixty-one to-day.
So we must have our fling;
A trifle old, perhaps, to dance,
At least we still may sing.
We will not linger in the past;
Old memories we’ll shun;
For there are yet good years ahead,
Although we’re sixty-one.
The Lord be praised, we still can find
Allure in cakes and ale,
And when the candles are alight
We'll spin another tale,
And it will be the cheeriest
Of many yarns we’ve spun ;
For Age may laugh where Youth must sigh
When we are sixty-one.
To radio we’ll sway and swing
Until the midnight chimes.
Get out the car!—the horse and trap
Are far behind the times.
With headlights pointing to the west
Where fenceless bush tracks run,
We’ll take the wheel and set the pace
Although we’re sixty-one.
We’ll blaze a track still further out
Than in the days of old,
Where trees are green beside the streams
And sand is flecked with gold.
We’ll go where plains lie stark and bare,
A-swelter in the sun.
For luck may still be waiting there
To greet old Sixty-one.

“Tom Willie”: A chap I met under
the Bargo River bridge (N.S.W.) the
other day was pretty hungry. He hadn’t
known that Bargo was no longer a dole

he said, “they couldn’t give me anything
to eat because it was a charitable insti-

“Bally”: “Mt. G.’s” added way of tell-
ing a bushman by his squatting (B.
26/9/’34) prompts me to add that when
down on his heels, if asked for direc-
tions, he’ll invariably draw a mud-map.
The greatest mud-mapper in history used
to keep the Kyabra pub—Adavale-Win-
dorah road. When asked the way to any-
where, he would bring a jug of water from
a bedroom, splinters and chips from the
woodheap, twigs and leaves of trees,
small bits of kerosene-tins and other odds
and ends. He would make roads and
hills out of the dust; hollows filled with
water denoted waterholes; chips and
splinters represented fences and yards ;
leaves and twigs were for timbered
patches, tin for the roofs of buildings.
If anything else was needed the direc-
tions would be held up till he went and
got it. And by the time you returned
to the pub there would be thirst which
made a visit to the bar necessary. If
that old fellow’s on hand when my time
comes, I’ll ask him for a mud-map, and
I won’t have any doubts about hitting
the Pearly Gates right dead centre.

sene soa p to wash himself and carefully
tend the dozen or so cakes of the other

money. After a bit we used it in barter;
three cakes of soap = one plug of Derby
or Victory tobacco. Then the boss’s

it only gave us a new set of values on
which to work, and represented a 50 p.c.

who were well loaded before the rise.
They went up to a bob. We continued

came desperate —they didn’t get loading
every week in those times. The store-
keeper shut down on us. It only just

excavation had been made by flood-
waters. The stream itself was a mere
trickle most of the year. Mostly the
molars were in a perfect state of pre-
servation, with the jagged edges un-
broken and green in color. For teeth
half an inch long we usually got six-
pence ; bigger ones fetched up to two
bob. The smaller ones were mounted
and worn as tiepins, the larger for pen-
dants. Since Carbine won the Cup I’ve
travelled a few thousand miles about
Australia, but never have I found petri-
fied sharks’ teeth anywhere else. They
were only in one spot in Muddy Creek,

“C.H.F.”: The gardener was working in

“Noel R.”: News that 100 tents at the
Scouts’ jamboree camp at Port Phillip
were razed in the father of a storm
prompts me. Use duck material (if you
can run to it); erect a forked sapling
perpendicularly fore and aft; two sap-
ling ridgepoles (for tent and fly); four
saplings as stays (two for’ard and two
aft), leaning against and crossing on the
fly ridgepole, with their butts in the
ground —set in a direction rectangular to
the ridge. Add two strainer poles (one
on each side of the tent), resting on the
stay-poles, with power to slide a little
up and down them, and at a convenient
height from the ground so that both tent
and fly guyropes can be made fast to
them (with a chance to “work” when wet
and dry), thus eliminating guyrope pegs.
Now, clamp the bottom of the tent walls
to the ground with wooden “hookeys,”
and erect a breakwind round the sides of
the tent whence gale-force winds might
be expected. Trench round the tent,
taking the precaution not to pitch under
big—or rotten —timber ; and sleep in
peace.

“Old-timer”: An elephantine thirst
was owned by Cup-o’-tea Mick, though
not for beer. The beverage that mastered
him was tea. His average consumption
was five gallons a day. Where other
’Bidgee whalers “hummed” a town for
booze, Mick “hummed” it for tea, going
from house to house with his plea:
“Missus, could y’ spring a cup o’ tea?”
Station cooks on his beat got in extra
pounds of pekoe for the month he was
due. One storekeeper bribed him to stay
seven weeks in Oxley, and bought a car
from his increased tea sales. When the
old Gem broke in half and was beached
below Mildura Mick walked 42 miles
and swam a river and three creeks
to salvage the tea from the galley. Jokes
were played on him with senna, cascara,
beheaded cloves; he took them all
and came up for more. Mick struck
our camp at Gilalbee Tank one night,
and consumed half a kero.-bucket of the
stuff between sundown and supper. He
had tea cached in hollow stumps and cul-
verts all over the mid-Riverina roads.
He would walk 30 miles a day to attend
a school picnic, church social or any such
function where there would be lashings
of tea. Michael died on the One Tree
Plain, 40-odd miles from Hay, after
heavy rain. There was plenty of water
and Mick had plenty of tea, but he had
forgotten that there are no means of
boiling a billy there unless you carry
your own fuel.

“Kaparoo”; G. H. Sunter, brother of
the late commander of the Manunda, did
nearly all his buffalo-shooting in North
Aus. per foot. He started the work in
1911, and, with a break of only two
years at the war, secured with his “boys”
more than 12,000 buffaloes. An old
Martini-Henri rifle, 450 calibre, was
used ; Sunter preferred it to all others,
despite the fact that it was a single-shot
affair. He also accounted for more than
4000 wild cattle. These were worse
to down than the buffs., for they pos-
sessed a turn of speed that the larger
animals did not have, and the bulls were
more formidable to face on foot.

“Miro”: Re the white waratah of Bar
Mountain (B. 16/l/’35). There are pro-

treasures among the hills and gorges of
the Hawkesbury Valley (N.S.W.). A
resident of Bay View, wandering in
Kuring-gai Chase some years ago, found
in a small gully a patch of white boronia.
Every spring thereafter he used to take
a party of flower-lovers to see his find,
which meant some miles in a launch and
a rough climb over the hills afterwards.
The last time he went he found some
vandals had visited the spot and ruth-
lessly uprooted the unique little wild
garden: a picnic fire had done the rest.

THE PARIAH.
Despite the sentiments of bards,
Love’s nothing but a subtle game.
Fate cuts the pack and deals the cards
For us to juggle with. The same
Applies to auction bridge; it’s luck
Combined with bidding shrewd and
quick.
Plus lots —oh ! lots —of faith and pluck,
Which stirs a heart or turns a trick.
Thus Love and Bridge are somewhat
kin —
Results hang mostly on the deal.
If Fate is kind perhaps you’ll win;
If not, it’s not the thing to squeal.
But while I’m touched by lovers’ groans
When maids say “No" instead of
“Yes,”
Fd gladly slay the chap who moans
Each hand, “Who dealt this rotten
mess ?”

THE DANGERS OF SPORT.
“Woman Injured in Wheelbarrow Race.”
~“S. M. Herald."
I’m against Sunday-school picnics. The
games indulged in are so dangerous. I
well remember the disaster that befell
Angela Shapely, who, besides being at
the time the light of my life, was also a
hot favorite for the “Girls’ under 14
egg-and-spoon race.”
The race started. Half a lap from
home and yards ahead of the only other
remaining competitor in a yolk-strewn
field, Angela tripped and fell. The egg
struck her in the mouth. All would
have been well, but someone had rung
in a china nest-egg on her. After all,
no girl looks her best with swollen lips
and three or four teeth missing, so it is
no wonder that in one glance I realised
my love for her was dead for ever.
When the time for the last event of
the day arrived I transferred my affec-
tions to Sally Soapsaver, who, I was
aware, had long adored me from afar.
The event was a thread-the-needle
race. You know the idea. Gentlemen
stand in a row holding in their right (or
is it their left?) hand a needle. Ladies
stand 50 yards off, each holding a length
of cotton. Bang! They’re off! Ladies
race to gentlemen. Gentlemen thread
needles. Ladies seize threaded needles
and rush back.
Sally was fleet of foot and reached me
in not much over evens.
Feverishly I jabbed at the thread. A
squeal from Sally.
“You clumsy idjit! You’ve pricked
my finger.” I have always been hot-
headed, and incensed by her outburst I
jabbed again.
She shrieked again and then planted
a straight left on my jaw, and I fell back
in a crumpled heap on my needle. In
a flash I was up again ; but she had left
the arena.
We never spoke again.
Three lives blit in a single afternoon!
No wonder I’m against these games.
Uco.
IT MIGHT WORK, BUT
“Commenting on Menzel’s criticism of Aus-
tralian tennis crowds, the ‘Daily Mail’ suggests
that the victims of barracking who get on best
are those who treat the remarks light-heartedly,
making an occasional counter-sally.”
“Ha, ha! Zat ees ver’ fonnee, n’est-ce
pas ?” remarked Fouquet, the French
champion, as he was hit under the ear
with a well-aimed piece of watermelon
skin. Smiling broadly, he faced the
crowd and continued: “You ’ave com'
to see ze good tennees, mes amis,
n’est-ce pas ? Eh bien, as ze Americans
say, get a load of zees.” He then threw
the skin into the air and served it into
the midst of the crowd.
The spectator whom it hit let drive
a fruit-pie, catching Fouquet a nasty
blow on the mouth. Shouting with
laughter, the Frenchman wiped his face
on the front of his shirt and urged his
opponent, Fitzboob, to join in the fun.
In a second the air was clogged with
flying foodstuffs, with the two champions
leaping and dodging all over the court.
This spirit of hilarity persisted until
Fouquet was laid out with a pineapple,
and Fitzboob, after counting ten over
his prostrate opponent, laughingly
claimed a forfeit.
“So young Trevithick be first Moonta laad t' fly?”
“Aye, it’s in the blood, Cap ’n. His gran’ma bought first
p’ram’lator to teown.”
The crowd greeted the jest with cheers,
and the umpire, joining in, awarded him
the match.
Fouquet in an interview after his re-
vival said it was the most amusing experi-
ence of his tour. “They said it wiz fruit,”
he remarked smilingly.

AUTO-SUGGESTIONS.
“The peculiarities of certain vocations tend to
make some car drivers strangely liable to
become involved in accidents.”
— Magistrate’s comment.
True. I know a punter who, imme-
diately he gets into his car, invariably
puts it into reverse. It’s sheer force of
habit that makes him want to back it.
Another acquaintance of mine is
always falling foul of the traffic cops
because of his liking for high speeds.
He just simply can’t help tearing along.
He runs a laundry.
The high mortality among plumber-
drivers is quite understandable. Not
only do they forget their tools and
destinations, but some of them even for-
get they are driving a car at all.
Perhaps the most peculiar case of this
vocation-complex was that of Tim Tuf-
fyde, a politician, who was sued for
damages arising out of a motor accident.
The witnesses were unanimous that the
defendant swung his car right across the
street and with seeming deliberation
knocked the plaintiff down. Cross-
examined, Tim admitted that habits
inculcated in the House had gained a
strong hold on him, and he had merely
done what he had been doing nearly
every day in Parliament. Seeing a fellow
on the other side, he had answered the
irresistible urge to “run him down.”

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XIX. —The AUDITOR.
With looks suspicious and accusing
Through the door he quietly slips,
And the office wit’s amusing
Greeting dies upon his lips.
The scrubby office-boy looks guilty;
The senior clerk has lost his dash;
While the cashier at his counter
Trembles as he counts his cash.
Why this should be I do not know —
The fact remains that it is so.
,Probably no other professional man is
so generally disliked as the auditor. In
himself he is not such a bad chap—a bit
dumb perhaps, but quite bearable —yet
as soon as he produces his fountain-pen
charged with green ink everyone who
comes in contact with him feels impelled
to take him away into a corner and
shove sufficient vouchers down his throat
to silence him for ever.
The accountant who has been faking
his books naturally doesn’t welcome the
auditor’s visit, while the man who has
been honest enough or clever enough to
know that there is not the slightest
chance of anything being discovered
against him burns with indignation at
the suggestion of dishonesty which the
auditor’s presence implies.
For his part, the auditor acts as
though he regards everyone from the lift-
man to the managing director as a poten-
tial swindler, embezzler or forger.
Years ago a Judge in a weak moment
ruled that “It is not an auditor’s business
to take stock.” Auditors at once seized
upon this ruling and twisted it round, so
that they now interpret it as “It is an
auditor’s business to do everything but
take stock.”
By virtue of this they claim access to
every room, safe, drawer and book in
the office. Even the manager’s private
appointment book, the junior clerk’s list
of certainties for Saturday, the typists’
morning-tea-club book and the office-
do, not “ cap !:
course, access to such volumes doesn t
help them much in the actual job of
performing the audit, but they get a
lot of interesting information.
r First-hand discovery of any serious
fraud or defalcation is not an auditor’s
business. He may have occasion to call
upon the office-boy to explain a shortage
of 2d. in his stamp account, or to repri-
mand a ledger-keeper for omitting to
folio an entry ; but actual fraud, no.
Such things usually come out like this.
The cashier is found dead at his desk
with a revolver in his hand. There is a
shortage of fifteen hundred pounds ten
shillings and some odd pence in the cash,
and his desk is full of betting tickets.
After a while the police become suspi-
cious, and suggest an investigation,
whereupon the auditor discovers that the
deceased has been rigging the books for
43 years.
This is splendid, as it gives him an
opportunity of “tightening up” the system
so that it won’t happen again. Auditors
love tightening up systems.

INDUSTRY BUILDING INDUSTRY
According to the Chinese, the world’s
first collapsible sunshade was sponsored
by an emperor. With a servant holding
the ’shade above him, this emperor strode
forth from his palace, and immediately
all his people exclaimed; “We, too, must
have sunshades!”
To enable him to fulfil such a stagger-
ing order, the inventor of the sunshade
had to build a large factory and engage
thousands of craftsmen. Thousands
more craftsmen were absorbed into the
factories which supplied him with silk,
wooden frames and handles.
Scarcely had the initial demand been
met than customers began to call for
sunshades of distinctive design. Orders
came also from countries beyond the
seas. Then some of the early efforts
began to wear, and they, with others
broken and lost, had to be replaced.
The various factories continued to
work at high pressure, and the many
workers to whom the coming of the
sunshade had brought occupation and
wages continued in steady employment.
Thus did a simple invention establish an
important industry.
What the sunshade did for the work-
ing man of those distant days has been
done less fancifully by the modern motor-
car—an invention infinitely more intri-
cate. Few car-users realise just how in-
tricate the motor-car is. While some of
its multiple parts are simple, most are
complex—segments ingeniously conceived
and requiring a high degree of skill in
their construction.
Both Servant and Employer
Everything in a motor-car has to be
made by someone: everything has to
be fitted into place by someone. So,
paradoxically, we find that the car, be-
sides being the world’s servant, is one
of the world’s greatest employers of
labor.
In 1768, satisfied at having produced
the first self-propelling road vehicle,
Nicolas Cugnot probably never dreamed
that a time would come when the con-
struction, assembling and maintenance of
such vehicles would provide a profitable,
full-time occupation for armies of men
and women in many countries.
As was the case with the sunshades of
Old China, the demand for cars is huge
and continuous. They have to be built,
maintained, and, when they wear out,
replaced. In every quarter of the globe
there are hosts of workers who have
cause to bless the car’s existence.
Here in Australia the gain to industry
is a tremendous one. All the year round
car construction and maintenance, and the
manufacture of materials used in these
operations, provide a lucrative livelihood
for thousands of Australian families.
As a result, not only those directly
affected, but the Commonwealth gener-
ally is richer and happier.
Five Thousand Workers
Our premier car-manufacturing com-
pany, General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
has 5000 Australians on its payroll at
the present time. They work in Bris-
bane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide,
their salaries and wages exceeding the
princely total of £1,000,000 a year.
No mean achievements in themselves,
big-scale employment and the resulting
circulation within the Commonwealth of
£1,000,000 annually are far from being
the only contribution that this Austra-
lian company is making towards our
national prosperity. General Motors-
Holden’s, Ltd., may be likened to an
important stone cast into the pool of in-
dustry. The ripples carry to the furthest
edges.
Car-building Needs
In addition to the 5000 men and
women directly employed, there are at
the very least 2000 people in other in-
dustries solely engaged in producing
material and parts for this organisation.
Assuming that each employee in the
grand total of 7000 has at least two de-
pendants, General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
can claim that its operations support
21,000 persons.
Local craftsmen assemble the chassis
and bodies of the several makes of cars
and trucks which the company markets,
and it is the avowed policy of the local
board of directors to use as many local
components as possible. To examine
actual purchase figures is to know that
encouragement of allied industries is no
idle claim.
This year General Motors-Holden’s,
Ltd., expects to buy material and iftanu-
factured products from other Common-
wealth companies at a cost approximat-
ing £1,600,000, purchases which will in-
clude £275,000 worth of Australian
leather, leathercloth and other upholstery
materials ; £220,000 worth of Australian
tyres, mats and other rubber fittings ;
£160,000 worth of Australian springs,

shackle-bolts and U-bolts; £150,000
worth of Australian timber, steel and
glass ; and £120,000 worth of Australian-
made paints, lacquers and kindred pro-
ducts.
As well as influencing a wide circle of
men, women and children in the matter
of their daily bread, any concern which
buys so extensively can be a powerful
factor in lowering costs of production
generally. In industry it is a principle and
a fact that the more articles you make
of one kind the cheaper does each be-
come. Incidentally, the less a customer
has to pay for one article the more money
he has for purchasing others.
Were it not for the considerable orders
received from General Motors-Holden’s,
Ltd., many Australian manufacturers
would not be able to supply other com-
panies with similar goods at prices so
low. For instance, if this organisation
did not purchase 12,000 local spark
plugs each month, local spark plugs
would cost more to make. At present,
thanks to manufacturing volume, the
retail price of an Australian spark plug
is as much as Is. 9d. cheaper than the
retail price for a spark plug in England.
One of the biggest industrial organi-
sations in the Commonwealth, General
Motors-Hclden’s, Ltd., provides a splendid
example of how industry is helping to
build industry in a country where suc-
cessful industry is of vital importance.
You may think of it as a big brother,
hard-working and generous, on whom
many younger brothers lean.

There can be no doubt that, besides
employing Australians itself, using a
large amount of Australian capital, dis-
tributing dividends to 1500 Australian
shareholders, lowering Australian produc-
tion costs, and meeting Australia’s trans-
port needs, the company is aiding in
every way possible the development of
Australian secondary industry, thereby
winning for our nation ever-increasing
prosperity.
Its policy, never departed from, is to
give definite preference to local products
—to make the Australian content of its
cars and trucks as high as possible with-
out sacrificing quality. Australian goods
of quality and price comparable with
those overseas will always be bought in
preference to the imported article. Actu-
ally, the only things brought from over-
seas are essentials not being manufac-
tured here.
Local Contributions Are Great
Desirable though it would be, manu-
facture and assembly in Australia of all
chassis and engine parts have not been
practicable up to the present. A popu-
lation comparatively small means that
our domestic market is restricted ; there-
fore, mass production, with the resulting
low costs, cannot be practised here on
the same gigantic scale as in England
and America.
Australia, however, is able to produce
a big proportion of the complete car or
truck. In addition to the items already
specified, the cars and trucks marketed
by General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., in-
clude such locally-made parts as springs,
batteries, jacks and other tool equipment,
shock absorbers, axle clips, shackle bolts,
washers, door handles, spare-wheel
mountings, tyre pumps, bushings and
starting crank handles—all parts supplied
by independent companies.
It will be seen that once a car or truck
is begun the little wheels and the big
wheels of a host of industries start to
revolve. Miners dig a little deeper, trains
rumble, and ships plough our coastal
waters to speed up production of another
piece of mechanism.
Where Plants Operate
The manufacturing operations of
General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., are not
the gain of any single State. Queens-
land, New South Wales, Victoria and
South Australia all have a share in mak-
ing Chevrolets, Vauxhalls, Oldsmobiles,
Pontiacs, Buicks, Cadillacs, La Salles,
Bedfords and G.M.C’s. ready for the
road and in keeping them on the road.
Melbourne builds truck bodies, but the
main plant for building bodies is on the
outskirts of Adelaide. All but a negli-
gible quantity are constructed in Adelaide
from Australian materials, and are then
shipped to Melbourne, Sydney and Bris-
bane, where there are extensive assembly
plants. Here the Adelaide bodies are
fitted to their chassis.
Spread over 40 acres and including
1,000,000 square feet of covered space,
Holden’s main body-building factory in
the Adelaide suburb of Woodville is a
place of which Australia may well be
proud. In all, £1,500,000 is invested at
Woodville, where there is plant and
machinery valued at more than £700,000,
Another £60,000 is now being spent on
supplementing and improving the plant
with a view to increasing the volume of
production. Most of this new equipment
is of Australian manufacture, and promi-
nent among it are two of the biggest
presses ever made, together with five
hydraulic pumps with attendant accumu-
lator —products of Charles Ruwolt Pty.,
Ltd., Richmond, Victoria.
Last year Holden’s wages bill totalled
£590,000. At present 3500 men and
women are employed, but eight years
ago, when conditions in Australia were
booming, employees numbered 4300.
Those were the days when the average
motorist had to think only once before
deciding to replace his old car with a new
one, and companies concerned in motor
manufacturing flourished accordingly.
Woodville’s largest production for one
year—the year 1926 —was 46,942 bodies,
and its largest output for one month
5897 bodies. With the return of better
times. General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
looks forward to the day when those
figures will be beaten.
From Leather to Limousine
Holden’s began 50 years ago as a
saddlery and leather business. The story
of the body-building industry in Aus-
tralia is largely the story of this 50-year-
old firm —now the biggest organisation
of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.
Half a century ago, before the crack
of whip and the beat of hoofs gave way
to the toot of horns and the purr of
powerful cars, Holden’s leather and
saddlery store pursued a peaceful trade
in then-rural Woodville. During the
war horse-drawn coaches were being
made here, and then came the decision
which was to metamorphose Holden’s
and make Holden’s a national name.
At the request of a conference of
motor distributors in Sydney, Holden’s
made its first motor-car body. Altogether,
in that first year of production, 100
bodies were built. Within six years a
large four-storey building in the centre
of Adelaide had proved inadequate, and
it was then that the 40-acre site at Wood-
ville was chosen for the concentrated
activities of Holden’s.
A paramount factor in the establish-
ment of the body-building industry was
the courage and foresight of South Aus-
tralian business men. They saw the
opportunity, seized it, and built on their
foundation so soundly and wisely that
their factories were able to weather the
economic depression which wrecked
many others.
Early in the development of their in-
dustry they saw the limitations of the
local market and visualised beyond it.
From small beginnings they planned to
build an industry which should embrace
every State in the Commonwealth.
The result is that to-day motor bodies
for many makes of European and
American cars are shipped from Ade-
laide to every city in Australia where
assembly plants function. Furthermore,
during the last two years the overseas
market has shown increasing possibilities.
Export Opportunities
In some measure this chance for a
profitable export trade is due to the fact
that England and America, the principal
centres of automobile manufacture, are
not producing tourer and roadster bodies
to anything like the same great extent
as before, because the demand in those
countries is now confined almost entirely
to closed types—saloons and coupes.
Elsewhere, though, tourer and road-
ster bodies retain their popularity. In the
Far East, Africa, India, Egypt and South
America open bodies have a large market
and one likely to continue. It is this
trade that Australia has every oppor-
tunity of capturing.
Realising the possibilities, General
Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., is making strenuous
efforts to establish its products abroad,
already with a gratifying measure of
success. Lately a considerable number
of Holden bodies has been shipped to
Madras, Calcutta, Singapore, Batavia,
Sourabaya, Bombay and Rangoon.
Specially strengthened for the rough
conditions encountered in outback Aus-
tralia, Holden bodies are similarly suitable
for India, South Africa, China, the East
Indies and other areas where all roads
are not of a glassy smoothness. Experi-
ence has shown that they alone can stand
up to really hard usage off the beaten and
macadamised track, so it is little wonder
that they are being favored in preference
to bodies sent from England and
America.
More employment for Australians and
a further lessening of home production
costs will be incidental results from the

An Invitation
The importance of Australian Manufactur-
ing Industries can be appreciated only by
those who remember the hundreds of
thousands of Australians they employ.
The efficiency of our factories can be known
only by those who take every opportunity to
inspect them.
We invite you to inspect the most modern
Spring Plant in Australia.
t
HEN the Crusaders visited Damas-
cus during the Eleventh Century
they discovered swords of such
exclusive characteristics that they could not
be equalled anywhere else in the world.
To-day, manufacture of products to subtle
specification is not so localized. The original-
equipment and replacement springs made by
National Motor Springs are exactly equal to
the overseas product, thanks to truly scientific
equipment and principles of manufacture.

development of this export trade. The
potential value is tremendous. It will be
another feather in the Holden cap if
successful competition can be continued
in a field monopolised hitherto by Eng-
land and America, creating more wealth
for Australia and increasing volume of
manufacture.
Volume has meant everything to the
works at Woodville. As the boom years
approached, mass production and more
efficient factory organisation were intro-
duced. Increasing output brought about
mass production, and this in turn led to
greater volume.
To-day Woodville has an industry de-
veloped on a national basis and un-
approached in any other State. The
Holden plants are unequalled in Aus-
tralia ; in fact, they are surpassed by none
in England and by few in the United
States, the home of huge motor corpora-
tions and giant assembly plants.
Australian Raw Material
Skilled supervision and labor allied to
modern machinery enable Holden’s to
conduct motor-body-building in Aus-
tralia on lines which compare most favor-
ably with those of automobile centres
overseas. Of the machinery and equip-
ment 70 per cent, is of British Empire
manufacture, 50 per cent, of which is
Australian.
A feature of the industry is the extent
to which raw material of Australian
origin is employed, A little over 80 per
cent, of the material used in a Holden
body is Australian, and even in the most
sumptuous bodies the proportion of im-
ported material is extremely small.
At Woodville, as well as at every centre
where General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
operates, you find the directors’ prefer-
ence policy being practised. If a local
manufacturer can supply an article of
good quality at a reasonable cost, his
product is given preference over similar
articles from abroad.
Companies Which Help
Some idea of the benefit derived by
allied industries can be gleaned from
Holden’s list of material requirements for
this year. All such material is for body-
building only. The list takes no account
of local contributions to the chassis.
Body requirements include 8000 tons
of sheet steel; 1000 tons of bar steel;
200.000 gross of wood and metal thread
screws ; 4,000,000 super, feet of timber;
273.000 square feet of plate glass;
1.250.000 square feet of leather; 400,000
yards of leathercloth and hood material;
350 tons of padding, wadding and the
like ; and 70,000 gallons of lacquer.
Apart from the many manufacturers
who contribute to the chassis portion of
cars marketed by General Motors-
Holden’s, Ltd., there are more than a
hundred suppliers of body materials—all
Australian companies whose volume of
trade and number of employees would
be smaller if car bodies were imported
or if they were built with imported
materials.
Woodville obtains most of its leather
from Howe and Co. Pty., Ltd., Preston,
Vic. Duco lacquer, thinners, undercoats
and enamel are supplied by British-Aus-
tralian Lead Manufacturers, Ltd., Con-
cord, N.S.W. Fabrex, rubberised top
materials and material for curtain blinds
are made by Leathercloth Pty., Ltd.,
Melbourne.
Body hardware and body furniture
come from Die Casters Pty., Ltd., Colling-
wood, Vic,; chipboard from Australian
Paper Manufacturers, Ltd., Melbourne;
wood and metal thread screws from
Nettlefolds Pty., Ltd., Sunshine, Vic.;
black bolts and nuts from McPherson’s
Pty., Ltd., Melbourne.
The Broken Hill Pty. Co., Ltd,, and
Melbourne Iron and Steel Mills Pty.,
Ltd., supply bar steel, and sheet steel is
supplied by John Lysaght (Australia),
Ltd. Body timbers come from Tas-
mania, the principal suppliers being
Henry Jones and Co. Pty., Ltd., Hobart,
and Chesterman and Co., Launceston.
Direct contact with the wool industry
is made in the matter of headlining and
upholstery felt, supplied in large quanti-
ties by the Sydney and Melbourne
woollen felt mills of Federal Felters Pty.,
Ltd.
Motor bodies have been a potent
factor in developing the activities of this
company, which has large numbers of
employees working exclusively to meet
the orders of General Motors-Holden’s,
Ltd.
Felt is a fabric produced by the inter-
locking or matting together under mois-
ture, pressure and heat, without any
weaving process, of fibres, among which
wool is by far the most effective. It
follows, therefore, that quality in high-
grade felts, depending primarily on the
scale structure and waviness of wools,
must almost of necessity be produced
only from fine Australian wools. Federal
Felters Pty., Ltd., takes full advantage
of its position at the very source of the
world’s finest wools, with consequent
benefit to Australia’s chief primary indus-
try.

Home of the Body Beautiful
To view the Holden works at Wood-
ville, where all these independently-made
materials and parts are being used daily,
is for most people a revelation. We are
too inclined to accept a car body merely
as something to ride in, but an under-
standing of the many processes which the
building of the body beautiful involves
quickens appreciation and produces a
sense of wonder as to how the cost to
the customer can be so low.
Carefully designed, every Holden body
is built to conform to very exacting speci-
fications, and, before finally being passed
for delivery, has to gain full marks in
no fewer than 1213 progress inspections.
All Holden work is guaranteed correct
in material and measurement, and, as
owners know well, carries the hallmark
of quality.
The plant has 20 main departments.
These include the designing and drawing
office, pattern and die-making section,
pressing department, panel-fabricating
department, upholstery department,
timber mill, upholstery spring depart-
ment, assembly line and duco line. There
is not a corner where you can forget

GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDEN’S, LTD.
(Woodville Plant, Adelaide)
Above is illustrated the first of the two presses
preparatory to transportation, and, below, the
procession of components on its way to the wharf,
giving a visual idea of its comparative size.
DETAILS:
The operating tables, of which there are five per press,
range in weight from 10 to 15 tons each, and take the
form of steel castings. Each is 12ft. in length and 6ft.
in width, and when assembled into units the complete
press will be 23ft. 6in. in height and weigh 75 tons.
Apart from the mammoth presses, there is an array of
subsidiary gear and plant. This is extensive, and repre-
sents the unique adoption of modern principles to the
same end. This embraces a large hydraulic accumulator,
a battery of high-pressure pumps operating at 25001 b.
per ■ square inch, high-pressure centrifugal pumps, and
hydraulic accumulators and other features _ incorporating
the latest development of the science of applied hydraulics.
Shipped on the 15th January, 1935, by the Mareeba from Melbourne to
Woodville, South Australia, for the Body Division of General Motors-
Holden’s, Ltd., was the first of two giant hydraulic presses of 500-ton
capacity to be used in the manufacture of the latest-design motor-car bodies.
Designed by General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., engineers, the press was
manufactured completely to specification by Ruwolt’s in Melbourne.
The press is unique in size and productivity, and is larger than anything
else of the kind existing within the Commonwealth.
Into these presses have been infused the best in technical skill and design,
in metallurgy and foundry practice, and in high precision from modern
machine tools.

that here is an Australian plant employ-
ing Australian craftsmen and Australian
products.
Situated between the Port Adelaide
railway line and the Port-road, the 40
acres where a large proportion of Aus-
tralia’s car-bodies are planned and built
provide a tangible and impressive illus-
tration of individual achievement. Here
you feel is successful secondary industry
symbolised in steel.
Among tall and spacious covered
buildings, hives of activity and sound,
several chimney-stacks rise. You notice
also a water tower, ivy-screened and
looking slightly incongruous amid so
much mechanical modernism. There are
wide roads, green and graceful lawns,
flower-beds, hedges and a neat office
building properly called The Bungalow.
Fruit-cases, Too
Not far from the main gate huge quan-
tities of timber rest on wheeled cradles.
When these stacks are ready for use the
wheels will facilitate their transport to
the mill, but first they must wait and be
weathered for 12 months, then passing
to drying kilns for removal of any re-
maining moisture.
Holden’s utilise timber in other pro-
ducts besides car bodies. The casual
visitor learns with surprise that they
make the bulk of cases for the Australian
citrus and dried-fruit industries. The
wood-working plant necessary to handle
car bodies takes these in its stride, with
the result that fruit cases to-day are 20
per cent, cheaper. Formerly the citrus-
grower, and the cheese producer, too,
for cheese cases are made also, relied on
overseas manufacturers for their cases,
but now importations have practically
ceased, although case-making is un-
assisted by any tariff.
If you visit Holden’s while work is in
progress, you see the men’s bicycles—
hundreds of them—hung by their front
wheels on hooks, ready for the home-
ward run. When a whistle gives the sig-
nal to knock off for the day, this sym-
phony of steel will cease, giant machines
will forsake their rhythm, and 3500 men
and women will
stream out of the
gates richer for
having labored in
one of Australia’s
finest factories.
How is a motor-
car body made?
Mighty few people
have more than a
vague idea. Before
it can be made at
all from three to
four months have
to be spent on the
prepa ration of
drawings, specifica-
tions, patterns and
dies. Every time
Holden’s decide on
a new type of body
this preliminary
process has to be
gone through.
A car body is
conceived in the
designing and
drawing office.
The experts study
the blue-prints sent
from abroad, pos-
sibly retain the general outline, arid
then set to work to design a body suit-
able for arduous conditions, and one
which can be made with Australian
materials. A Holden body is never a
copy of one from overseas. Its ex-
terior may resemble bodies designed in
L. J. Hartnett, managing director
General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.
Britain and America, but there the re-
semblance ends.
Besides making exact drawings of
every part, the originators must prepare
a list of every item required in the manu-
facture. They must know even how
many tacks will be needed in each body.
When the list has been checked the mul-
tiple items, if not already in store, must
be ordered.
Even when the
drawings and speci-
fications are com-
plete, the depart-
ment’s work is far
from done. The
making of wooden
and metal patterns
must be carefully
superintended. If
one of the dies
from which panels
are pressed is a
hairbreadth incor-
rect, the entire
body may be
ruined.
Design and Execu-
tion.
When actual
manufacture has
begun the design-
ing and drawing
office is kept busy
dealing with sug-
gested minor alter-
ations from the
men on the job.
It might be sug-
ges t e d that a
shorter screw be used in one place. The
office has to investigate the advisability
of such a change—whether it would be
satisfactory from an engineering view-
point and what would be its effect on
fabricated material —and, , if it is
adopted, notify the departments con-
cerned, making sure that there are suffi-
cient supplies of the new screw available.
So that wood and steel samples can
be made, scale detail drawings are sent
to the pattern shop. When sample jobs
have been set up and approved, dies for
the pressing of panel and other parts
are prepared, and production begins at
last.
Mostly hidden from the eye, but none
the less important, Australian hardwoods
take a leading place in Holden bodies.
You see them being fashioned in the ex-
tensive wood mill, where there are high-
speed shapers, drills which can make
several holes simultaneously, and an in-
genious contrivance which dovetails and
glues pieces of wood together, giving you
any length or width you wish. A no-waste
department this. All oddments are used
as fuel for Holden’s gas plant.
As various portions of the body’s wood
frame are finished they are stored. The
mill keeps ahead of production, so that
the assembly department never has to
wait. From the stock of parts made in
the mill the assembly department draws
whatever is needed to meet the weekly
orders of motor distributors throughout
Australia.
Another important department, not
concerned in the actual work of assem-
bling a body, is one for the fabrication
of upholstery material. Sometimes as
many as 40 sets of upholstery material
are cut into correct shape by an electric
knife at a single swoop.
On this upstairs floor you see some
of the 200 girls whom Holden’s employ.
Operating many machines, they sew the
upholstery so that it can be attached
readily to the body when it reaches the
production line in the assembly depart-
ment. Other girls are busy stuffing seat

springs into bags of hessian joined to-
gether. Separation of springs in this
manner is a new idea. The object, of
course, is to eliminate groaning.
The assembly of a body from parts
already produced is effected on a small
truck. This truck moves continually on
a chain conveyor line, passing through
each department in its right sequence,
until the body is complete and ready for
shipment. The whole journey occupies
about seven days.
Building Up the Body
The first operation is to build up the
wood frame in a jig. This is a kind of
mould made most accurately. A jig
enforces the correct fitting of all parts
of the frame, thereby ensuring a solid
foundation for the metal panels to come
later.
At this stage the frame is braced with
metal angle brackets and in other ways.
At times motor-cars in Australia have
to withstand severe road shocks, and so
Holden’s make a point of bracing their
bodies a good deal more securely than
do most body-builders overseas.
As well as bracing, hessian and a
rubber compound are placed between all
wood joints, and wherever metal is at-
tached to wood. A Holden body must
not squeak, and everything possible is
done to eliminate squeaking.
When the frame has been completed
you get a first vague idea of -how the
ultimate body will look. You see the

bones of the body to be. The frame is
now mounted on one of the constantly
moving trucks on the conveyor line. It
is ready for its panels.
Giant Panel Presses
The pressing of panels at Woodville
is a story in itself. They are done in
batches by huge presses, some of them
capable of a pressure representing 500
tons. Otner powerful machines in this
section produce such parts as metal
braces.
Back, side and roof panels are attached
and joints welded together while the
skeleton body moves slowly onward.
Completely panelled, the body is a
thing of beauty only in shape, but soon
its metallic dullness is to be hidden for-
ever, when a first brown coat of priming
material is sprayed on inside and out.
Grey coats follow, the body proceed-
ing through a series of long ovens. This
preliminary spraying and baking opera-
tion occupies some three hours. Next
screws are tightened, and a squad of
rubbers-down get busy with water and-
abrasive paper, smoothing the panels in
preparation for their half-dozen coats of
lacquer. Before lacquer is applied all
surfaces must be supremely smooth.
First comes an undercoating, and after-
wards the color coats. Spraying is far
from being a slow job. One man can
apply a complete coat in the space of
a few minutes, and the lacquer dries
almost immediately. If Holden’s used
the kind of paint 1 once put on coaches
and carriages, their bodies would be
much more than seven days in the build-
ing. As things are now, the period could
be less than seven days were not the
coats of lacquer so numerous. The
-mirror-like sleekness of your limousine
was not achieved in an hour, nor is it
the result of just a couple of sprayings.
Only Australian-made lacquer is used
at Holden’s. They blend it on the spot
and keep it agitated to maintain the
same consistency. Thus there is no
chance of a color varying in shade when
it is not meant to vary.
Lacquering done, the windows of the
body and the windshield frame receive
their glass, after which the conveyor line
proceeds through the upholstery depart-
ment. This looks not unlike the furni-
ture department of a city store. At
labelled points, such Australian-made
fittings as door handles, cushions and
mats are added. Every minute the body
becomes more and more Australian.
Transport by Sea
Packing of bodies nowadays is only a
nominal business. Holden’s put their
products on stands of wood, and that is
all. Once upon a time bodies were com-
pletely encased, but nowadays special
slings lower them into the holds look-
ing much as they do when they leave the
assembly lines.
So expert are the shipping people in
handling bodies uncased that scratches
and blemishes are rare ; broken windows
and windshields almost unknown. Should
a scratch or two occur the damage is
soon effaced in the paintshops after
chassis and engine have been fitted.
Some of the Woodville bodies go to
the neighboring suburb of Beverley,
where General Motofs-Holden’s, Ltd.,
has an assembly plant for chassis ordered
by South Australian distributors. Some
go to Java, India and other overseas
points, while the majority travel by sea
to the assembly plants in Melbourne,
Sydney and Brisbane.
- When you have followed the making
of a car body from start to finish, and
seen the contingents of men and
machines involved, you know that
Holden’s speak the truth when they say
that £1,500,000 has been spent to make
their customers comfortable.
Without the vast production and far-
reaching ramifications of the Holden
organisation, part and parcel of the Com-
monwealth-wide organisation known as
General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., motor-
car bodies of Holden quality would be
within the reach of only a few.
To-day thousands of Australians of
modest means are able to enjoy their
comfort, smartness and safety ; and their
existence means that many thousands
more Australians have work and wealth.
Recognised as of a quality that equals
the world’s best, the products of Wood-
ville are a fine tribute to the craftsman-
ship of this Australian company.
From saddle to sedan epitomises the
story of Holden’s, once a saddlery and
leather business and now unchallenged
leader of a most important secondary in-
dustry. “Body by Holden” ensures the
maximum in beauty, ease and extra
durability under Australian conditions.
Maintenance and Truck Bodies
The obligations of a manufacturer go
further than producing even the most per-
fect article that human ingenuity can
devise. The experience of building the
original article must surely qualify him
to maintain or use the modern phrase
“service it” better than anyone else.
That is why Holden’s have equipped
service branches in Adelaide, Melbourne,
Sydney and Brisbane with the necessary
plant to carry out the many jobs that in-
dividual car- and truck-owners continu-
ally call for. This car wants a scrape,
the result of the other chap’s bad driv-
ing, patched up to tone exactly with the
original color.
When one’s wife has dented a fender
on her afternoon with the car domestic
tragedy is saved by a rush job before the
car is driven home. A hood renewal,
conversion of a tourer into a camping
outfit, loose covers or “Couchette” side
windows, a new seat spring—all these
can be done at the Holden repair stations.
Direct to these stations also come a
full range of body spare parts, from
bumper bars to radiator mascots; parts
simply directed from the suppliers of the
original equipment.

The Melbourne branch carries a still
further emphasis. It is, in effect, a Vic-
torian Woodville, for here the production
of truck bodies is carried on in just as
complete a manner although not on so
large a scale as car-body-building at
Woodville. A number of standard bodies
are turned out, and the local body sup-
pliers already enumerated contribute a
similar category of parts. Unlike the car
buyer, users of trucks often need a
specially-designed body to meet special
conditions, and whatever these may be,
and even though it may be only a single
body, Holden’s (Melbourne) are able to
build it.
At Woodville an extensive business is
done also in shock absorbers. This, an-
other employment-making and money-
circulating activity, is a further Holden
contribution to an industry which uses
Australian materials, employs Australians
and distributes profits to Australian
shareholders.
Interior of Sydney Assembly Plant, General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., Sydney.
One is apt to be mildly hypnotised
by the Woodville plant, with its men
and machines, huge stocks of Australian
timber, leather, steel and other raw mate-
rial, and its general air of being sufficient
unto itself. Yet this is only one unit
of a company with costly plant in three
other States.
In Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne
further armies of workers in the employ
of General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., play
their part in putting and keeping the
Australian public on wheels. Each of
these cities has an extensive chassis-
assembly plant. Here the Woodville bodies
are fitted into their right surroundings,
and here also are shops for the repair
and renovation of bodies battered by
time or traffic.
The sight of an engineering plant in
full blast exerts queer and diverse effects
on the non-mechanical mind. There are
those who flee from it as something un-
canny, and others who are simply baffled
by it, as a boy is sometimes baffled by
a problem in geometry.
There are those who know so little
about it that they regard it with horror
—a menace to civilisation and the epi-
tome of all that is ugly. And there are
those who fall so far under its spell as
to regard it as the nearest approximation
to the sublime yet conceived by the mind
of man.
The result of this is that, while nine
motorists out of ten have a fairly accu-
rate idea of how a car goes and what
they must do when it goes wrong, not
one man in a hundred could tell you
exactly how the mechanical portions of
a car are assembled.
Assembling the Chassis
Familiarity with the process, as seen in
the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Adelaide plants of General Motors-
Holden’s, Ltd., breeds not contempt but
increasing awe. The first sight of a mass-
production assembly plant is apt to leave
one completely bewildered; but, if you
follow the process through its numerous
stages in their right order, the story
of motor-car building becomes clear and
captivating.
Have a look first at the storage section,
where supplies of locally-produced parts
wait ready for use. Here also the engines
and those parts which have to be im-
ported are taken from their crates.
Nearby modern blacksmiths are pneu-
matically riveting chassis members.
When riveted the chassis frame will be
placed on a trestle for the adding of
axles, springs, step brackets and other
parts.
On a bench mechanics are tinkering
with a line of half-assembled engines,
each with its set of Australian-made
spark plugs. Others are soldering petrol-
tanks rolled under pressure from sheet
metal, and a third group is assembling
steering mechanisms.
As with the bodies at Woodville, the
work of putting a complete car together
is carried out on slowly-moving conveyor
lines. Stage by stage the chassis frames,
having been treated with anti-corrosive
paint, acquire steering gear, engine, road
wheels fitted with Australian tyres, mud-
guards, radiator and other essentials.
When the conveyor line brings a
chassis directly beneath a large opening
in the roof, the appropriate body is
lowered from above and guided into
position. The men working here have
got the operation to such a fine art that
almost always a body falls exactly over
the right boltholes.
The car now looks complete, but there
is still much to be done. On it goes
gathering fresh gadgets until it reaches
the end of the conveyor line. Then the
engine is started, warmed up and tuned,
afterwards being driven under its own
power to a pit where steering and wheel
alignment are checked.
All along the conveyor line inspectors
have been watching the work closely, but
it is their job now to take the car for
a thorough road test. If they find any-
thing amiss, no matter how insignificant,
the car goes to the correction shop.
When the fault has been remedied it
is tested again, and if the inspectors are
still not satisfied it is returned for further
correction.
The Finished Product
The little label “0.K.,” pasted on the
windshield, means that a car has been
passed and proved. At this point the
paintshop takes charge of it, removing
scratches and incidental blemishes, lac-
quering, polishing and finishing. Again
the job is checked, and, if perfect in
every detail, it goes to the storage sec-
tion to await delivery or shipment.
Waiting in their shining rows after
completion, the cars and trucks of Gen-
eral Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., make a bril-
liant show. In the car class you notice
the Chevrolet, Vauxhall, Oldsmobile, Pon-
tiac, Buick, La Salle and Cadillac. Then
there are Chevrolet, Bedford and G.M.C.
trucks.
The results and influence of stream-
lining are discernible in wing treatment,
in interior comfort and visibility, even
in some of the trucks. General Motors-
Holden’s, Ltd., produce a utility truck
so splendid in appearance that the
wealthiest and most particular pastoralist
need not hesitate to go a-visiting in it.
One’s humility at not being able to
arrive at a perfect understanding of all
the many intricate processes involved in
the making of a car by General Motors-
Holden’s, Ltd., changes to a sense of
pride when one realises that the final
product is of real beauty and utility,
manufactured by an Australian company
employing Australian workmen from
hundreds of parts mostly made in Aus-
tralia.
It may be trite, but nevertheless true,
that no product is stronger or better than
the organisation behind it. Break a part
on the most expensive car in the world,
and if it isn’t immediately replaceable
that car becomes junk in relation to the
humblest car that will go.
If a man has owned a Buick, for in-
stance, the surest way of having him
buy another is to have him come back
safe in the knowledge that he can main-
tain it as a going concern for as long
as Iw likes. In simple terms, knowing

that he can always get a spare part that
will fit, and at a reasonable price.
For General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
the problem of always having parts on
hand is a comparatively easy one. It is
largely a matter of traffic, diverting some
of the parts made by local manufac-
turers for original equipment into the
Spare Parts Department. Naturally the
number in each stock range depends on
experience and age of car model. At
present in the South Melbourne head
office there are over 1,000,000 indivi-
dual parts, a cost value more than
£350,000, representing 55,000 different
items.
In addition to this parent stock, a Com-
monwealth network of 25 distributors
and 500 dealers carries a further stock
valued at approximately £lOO,OOO. So
that the owner of a Chevrolet, Vauxhall,
Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, La Salle,
Cadillac, Bedford or G.M.C. can quickly
get a genuine part when necessary, a
part that is an exact duplicate of the ori-
ginal. Moreover, these parts are uni-
formly priced throughout Australia. A
standard pricing system operated from
Melbourne insures that.
Parts Mean Employment
The stuff that is made is almost as
varied as the food in a Caliph’s kitchen,
—more prosaic perhaps, but it means
food in the mouths of thousands. There
the great firm of H. V, McKay Massey-
Harris Pty., Ltd., deliver drop forgings
and commercial hardware. Other drop
forgings, spanners, shackle pins, screw-
drivers come from Gregory Steel Pro-
ducts Pty., Ltd., whose modern heat fur-
naces have such a rosy glow on a Mel-
bourne winter day. Starting cranks
(just in case you do leave the ignition
switch on all night) come from the
Townley Drop Forge Co.; hosts of
steel stampings from the presses of A. H.
Mackie, also in Melbourne. Jack and
service tool equipment come from
A.P.A.C., Adelaide. Thousands of spark
plugs, the very soul of a motor, made
in their thousands by Pyrox, and
Assembly Plant, General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., Brisbane.
an endless variety of bright bolts and
nuts made in Sydney by John Sonner-
dale, Ltd.
In the bigger bins spare-tyre assem-
blies and body-holding bolts made by
W. O’Donnell in Melbourne, springs of
every describable size and tension com-
ing from the National Spring Works in
Sydney. The mild-looking battery
—civilisation’s greatest gift to the motor-
ist —is nonchalantly stocked in hun-
dreds after the long trip from the Exide
and other works in Sydney,
Having a regular and large customer
like General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
whilst important to an individual manu-
facturer, has a much larger effect. We
have already witnessed how fruit-case
prices rattled down after Holden’s at
Woodville started manufacturing them.
A further illustration is that of Central
Spring Works in South Melbourne, who
make shackle bolts, a variety of springs,
as well as all kinds of press work.
In the past 18 months the company
produced 500,000 nuts and spring wash-
ers, with 250,000 axle clips, and one
recent single order for 17,500 body
shims. That kind of volume, apart from
the price factor, needs the fastest and
most up-to-date machinery that money
can buy. Time alone demands speed;
price follows. The first immediate benefit
goes to General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
who to-day buy axle clips at exactly half
the price of 18 months ago. But the com-
munity at large benefits, because every
other buyer of axle clips or articles simi-
lar enough to be produced on the same
machines buys on the cheaper and better
results brought about by large initial
volume.
Twenty-two years ago Mr. W. O’Don-
nell started his engineering shop with a
forge and an anvil, developing into a
manufacturer of building-trade iron-
mongery. Five years ago he turned his
attention to the manufacturing of car
parts, and General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
are the biggest buyers. To-day his entire
staff is busy all day turning out thou-
sands of tie-rod balls and seats, body-
holding-down U-bolts, bumper retainers,
spare-wheel brackets and clamps and
steel shackles. All this isn’t done by
wishing. It means money ; it means skill
to make intricate parts within close
limits; it means the ability to do these
things at a competitive price. In the
background it means the expenditure of
large sums of money for plant. W.
O’Donnell’s plant has increased its pro-
ductive capacity in these last few years
no less than 600 per cent. He, in keep-
ing with other Australian manufacturers,
is willing to spend the money on plant
because he is dealing with an organ-
isation whose policy is consistently to buy
Australian material where it is economi-
cally procurable, and so long as a Gen-
eral Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., car is sold
in Australia it will be assembled on that
basis.
Machines and Men
For all the talk about the machine age,
one thing is certain. The quality of the
goods turned out by machines can only
be as good as the skill of the men who
design and operate them. Quality of
product lies in the capacity of the pro-
ducer to absorb and use experience as a
mentor. Merely possessing a machine
means nothing. It might perhaps be
called the age of specialisation, and
through the list of suppliers of parts is
seen the specialisation of the industries
concerned. Die Casters Pty., Ltd.,
specialise in those things which come
strictly within the known limits of their
capacity and knowledge. Automobile
door handles, door locks, vacuum wind-
shield wipers, robe rails, interior fittings,
all those things that come within
the scope of their intricate processes.
No one customer is bigger than General
Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., who make avail-
able not only to Die Casters Pty., Ltd.,
but to all suppliers the results of the re-
searches of their own laboratories, will-
ingly and free of charge.

Highest grade felt
for closed cars
With a finish fine enough for the most luxurious models,
with a texture strong and durable enough to stand long
service and hard wear, “Feltex” Felt is a credit to Australian
industry. Result of continual experiment and research, and
manufactured of 100% Australian wool on the most modern
machinery, Feltex Felt is far superior to flannel—is specially
felted to resist dirt, will not stretch or sag, and is made in
all desired colors.
Hundreds of thousands of yards are made annually by
Federal Felters Pty., Ltd., Melbourne; and their associated
company, Felt and Textiles, Ltd., of Sydney, specialise in
the manufacture of felt washers and other felts for the
automobile trade.
Cotton Dressings Pty., Ltd., a subsidiary of the above

Pyrox Pty., Ltd., are also specialists
in every sense of the word. The Pyrox
plug is produced under the aegis of Bosch
experts, and the name of Bosch is
synonymous for quality electrical equip-
ment throughout the wide world. A
spark plug has to resist terrific pressures
and intense heat, its apparent simplicity
being little help to visualise or under-
stand what it is subjected to. There is no
margin of error with a spark plug; if
it isn’t perfect the capital investment in
the modern high-speed car soon begins
to lose interest. That is why Pyrox
relies on the absolute duplication of
Bosch design and knowledge.
And so the movement of industry

mate object being the complete satis-
faction of the car-owner —the efficiency
of the car as a power unit, the appear-
ance of it as an artistic conception of
transport, the comfort of it as a vehicle.
Perhaps we can’t pass the word comfort
without thinking of springs. A spring
is surely simple enough, but to be satis-
factory it must match its mates for resili-
ency, strength and accurate measurement.
To this end National Motor Springs Co.,
of Sydney, have spent thousands of
pounds in development and research.
Australia demands different springing
from other countries ; climatic and road
conditions, long distances with their
danger of fatigue, requiring a specialisa-
tion which can only come from a keen
study of local conditions.
In fact, where production on such a
scale as this begins and ends is almost
impossible to define. Cotton from
Queensland, steel from Newcastle, timber
from Tasmania, wool and a dozen other
primary products, transported by bul-
lock team, truck, rail and steamer, all
take their share of money in the com-
pletion of the General Motors-Holden’s,
Ltd., range of cars and trucks.
A few names providing tangible and
obvious evidence of participation have
been listed, but imagination can run riot
in attempting to hook the threads of a
gigantic industry into a complete pattern.
The fringes, by no means flimsy, are
thousands of garages and competent
mechanics, who in turn take their part
in making motoring a pleasure for people
needing only to know how to sit up and
drive.
Heavy Industry Moves On
The ramifications of body-building
plants for cars and trucks, plants where
all the various units are assembled into
the complete unit, naturally require some
heavy machinery themselves. The most
recent additions to an already vast equip-
ment are two of the biggest body presses
either made or installed in Australia.
Standing 24ft. high, weighing 75 tons,
operated by five high-pressure hydraulic
pumps, costing over £lB,OOO, they sym-
bolise the skill of the Australian engineer
as well as the progress of the body-build-
ing industry.
Charles Ruwolt Pty., Ltd., of Mel-
bourne, nationally known for their heavy
industrial and mining engineering work,
have just completed building the first of
these presses. Their works cover an
area of 131 acres, the machine shop alone
covering 62,000 square feet, and equipped
with some of the heaviest and most
modern machine tools in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Literally hundreds of thousands of
pounds have been spent in these shops
by the great mines of Australia ; Lake
View and Star, Great Boulder, Wiluna,
Lancefield, Gwalia, Mount Magnet,
Mount Morgan, Mount Coolon, Mount
Lyell and Mount Isa, Golden Plateau,
the Broken-Hill mines and many others,
all familiar to the Australian public,
have been supplied by Ruwolt’s with
treatment plants or supplementary equip-
ment.
Continually increasing production, con-
tinually increasing plant and experience ;
the very foundation of national develop-
ment. Industry building industry, and
with it all the growing virility of a self-
supporting and independent nationality.
The Ultimate Aim
Efficiency is a word that has been
frequently used through this article. Yet
it is a dangerous word dragged into the
vernacular, often mouthed with hollow
pretence, often used as a smoke-
screen to cover the exploitation of
humanity. Critics, suspicious of the
commercial and industrial world about
them, have given the word short shrift.
To them it has become a soulless, grasp-
ing, covetous word whose ultimate pur-
pose is the degradation of what should
be a happier civilised life. They some-
times overlook the fact that efficiency as
a word is used where effectiveness would
be a clearer definition. Shorn of its objec-
tionable connotations, efficiency simply
means doing necessary work quickly,
quietly and conveniently, its ultimate
object being the release of humanity from
the slavery conditions of not so long ago.
It is efficiency in this, the true sense
of the word, which has been the main
inspiration in the construction and equip-
ment of General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.,
plants in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne
and Adelaide.
General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd., has
no desire to cheapen its products at the
expense of man-power. It is a proven fact
that no supplier is allowed to supply
goods at a loss to himself. He must
make goods to set specifications, and
under no condition will material be
accepted if it doesn’t meet them. But he
is encouraged, as are its own works, to
use the most efficient methods to meet
those ends, and that is where the real
value of price reduction becomes profit-
able. It is only simple business after all:
the manufacturer and his associate manu-
facturers who make profit have more
money to spend, and that means more
car sales.

Information Sought.
(1) Where, when and from whom did Frank
Thorn win the Australian featherweight boxing
championship ? (2) How long did he hold this
title, and who took it from him ? (3) Is Thorn
still living? —s273.
(1) At Sydney on June 30, 1906, against Ned
Murphy. (2) Till Paddy King knocked him
out at Perth on December 26, 1907. Thorn
regained the title by outpointing King at
Melbourne on March 1, 1909, but he later out-
grew the division, and Sid Sullivan became
recognised as champion. (3) No. He died in
Brisbane, February, 1930.
In a game of tennis A and B are playing
against X and Z; A serves to X, who returns
the ball, but B, playing at the net, intercepts
the return, smashing the ball back and out 6f
reach of either Xor Z. However, B, after
striking the ball in the air (on his right side
of the net ) allows his racquet to “follow
through” and hits the net. Does this striking
of the net after the execution of his successful
stroke play disqualify him, making the point
scored a forfeit to X and Z, or is his play in
accordance with the rules? —5151.
The point would be given against A and B.
Rule 17 says; “A player loses the
point if he or his racquet, in his hand or other-
wise, or anything that he wears or carries,
touches the net, posts, cord or metal cable,
strap or band, or the ground within his oppo-
nent’s court, when striking at the ball or at
any other time while the ball is in play.”
What income taxes are payable by a resident
of N.S.W. on yearly net income from property
of £lO,OOO p.a., £20,000 p.a. and £30,000 p.a. ?
—5077.
Federal income tax, £3091 14s. 2d., £6841
14s. 2d. and £10,591 14s. 2d.; Federal special
tax, £585, £llB5 and £1785. N.S.W. State in-

(1) Is it compulsory in Q’land for station
book-keepers and jackeroos to join the A.W.U. ?
(2) If so, what is the penalty for failing to do
so ? (3) Are employers liable to any penalty ?
—5200.
(1) Yes. (2) Dismissal from employment. (3)
Yes; not exceeding £5O.

(1) and (2) A change of surname may be
effected merely by usage and without any
formal procedure. It is usual, however, and
the better course, to execute a deed-poll drawn
up by a solicitor and file it in the Registrar-
General’s department. It is the practice, though
not obligatory, to advertise the change. (3)
Not fixed, but it should not exceed a guinea
or two. (4) A week should suffice. (5) Not
necessarily.
(1) Names of secretarial institutes or associa-
tions recognised in Australia ? (2) Approx,
membership of each (total in each State if
possible) ? (3) Is the incorporated Secretaries’
Association of London a recognised English
association ? (4) How does it rank or compare

C.I.S. has a branch in Sydney and is repre-
sented in most of the other States.
Is it possible to tell the time from the posi-
tion of the Southern Cross?— slsB.
This can only be done with accuracy by
means of a theodolite and nautical almanac,
and requires a knowledge of astronomy as
well as of the use of the instrument. Time
can be roughly ascertained from the position of
the pointers of the Southern Cross, which
complete one revolution, roughly, in 24 hours,
or 15 degrees each hour, but the position of
the Cross and pointers at any given hour varies
throughout the year.
I have a cricket bat upon which is inscribed
a number of signatures. These are fading.
How can I preserve them from further fading ?
—5230.
Give the bat a coat of transparent lacquer.
(1) How is candle-power measured? (2) C.P.
used for modern military searchlights ? —5234.
(1) By photometer. In the Bunsen photo-
meter a white screen has a grease spot at its
centre. The two lights to be compared are
placed on opposite sides of the screen and their
distances adjusted so that the grease spot is
invisible. The intensities of the two lights are
to one another as the squares of their distances
from the screen; the intensity of the standard
light known, the one under measurement can
be found. For example, if a standard light
of 1 c.p. is placed Ift. from the screen and
the light under measurement is 3ft. therefrom
it will have an intensity of 3 X 3, or 9 c.p.
(2) Searchlights employed in coast defence pro-
ject a beam of up to 200,000,000 c.p., and
operate on a power of up to 20,000 watts.
Are clockwork model aeroplane motors pro-
curable in Australia? If so, where? —sl6B.
Not obtainable anywhere. Such motors have
been tried, but none has proved as satisfac-
tory as the rubber motor, which scores by
reason of its high power-weight ratio, cheap-
ness, robustness and adaptability. Further-
more it gives power for very long flights. The
official Australian flying record for the rubber
motor, held by J. Brown, of Albury, is 54
minutes.
What explanation is there of the occurrence
of quicksands in creeks ? —5290.
They occur wherever conditions are favorable
to the formation of patches of very fine sand
mixed with water. In many cases this sand is
mixed with clay or calcium carbonate, which
retains water while surrounding pure sand is
firm. Some so-called quicksands are actually
beds of fine mud overlaid with sand.
What is (1) a cental; (2) a quintal ? —5295-
(1) 1001 b. avoirdupois, generally connected
with grain, but sometimes extended to fruits
and market produce. (2) A variable weight.
Usually any substance or goods equal to 1001 b.,
although under the avoirdupois system it is
sometimes taken as one ewet. (1121 b.). The
metrical quintal contains 100 kilograms or
x220.491b.
(1) If a pound of water is frozen will the
resultant ice weigh more or less ? (2) If a
quart of water is frozen will the product be
greater nr less ? —5298.
(1) There will be no difference in weight.
A pound of water may be frozen to a pound
of ice and melted again (if there is no evapora-
tion) will still weigh lib. (2) The ice resultant
from a quart of water will exceed one quart in
volume. Water expands in forming ice.
Is there such a regiment as the Khyber
Rifles, or does it only exist in fiction ? —5287.
The Khyber Rifles did actually exist. It was
a body of Indian frontier irregular militia
formed in 1887 from tribes bordering the
Khyber Pass to man the chain of forts which
command the Khyber and protect caravans
passing between India and Afghanistan from
raiding parties. In the Afghan War of 1919
these troops became so ineffective that the
force was disbanded.
Has the passenger air service between Sydney
and Newcastle been discontinued ? Any infor-
mation on the subject ? —5289.
The service continues, but the timetable has
been revised. ’Plane leaves Mascot aerodrome
daily at 8 a.m. and 3.20 p.m., Monday to
Friday. N.E. Airways car picks up ’passengers
in Martin-place, 7.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Satur-
day timetable is same for morning run; after-
noon 1.40 from Mascot. Return trips leave
Newcastle, Monday to Friday, 8.50 a.m. and
4.15 p.m.; Saturdays, 8.50 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.

In press reports of a woman’s suicide, it
was stated in evidence that she had been advised
to undergo hypnotic treatment for nerve
trouble. Is there any record of hypnotism
curing nervous afflictions ? —5242.
Hypnotism gives no permanent result. In
all cases the state of hypnosis is characterised
by personal aptitude for accepting the control.
Although at one time much used in treatment
of functional nervous disease, it is now largely
superseded by methods demanding self-sugges-
tion and intelligence on the part of the patient.
(1) Function of the kidneys and cause of
Kidney trouble ? (2) What causes a person’s
hands and feet to perspire excessively? —slBB.
(1) The function of the kidneys is to separ-
ate solid waste matter in solution from the
blood. They are organs of excretion, and any-
thing that interferes with their work gradually
involves the renal mechanism in toxic or in-
flammatory congestion. (2) Usually some form
of nervous debility.
What is “Chelsea Pensioner,” as given for
rheumatism ? How did the remedy originate ?
—5214.
It is a sulphur and guaiacum confection. As
a tribute to its virtues Lord Anson (or Am-
herst) is stated to have purchased the formula,
which appeared in medical textbooks about
1821. Of many variations since published the
following is representative of the original: Mix
together 2oz. sulphur, loz. cream of tartar, 2
drachms powdered rhubarb, 1 drachm powdered
gum guaiacum, \ drachm powdered nutmeg, 11b.
honey. The adult dose is one or two teaspoons
night and morning, followed with a glass of
hot water.
Cause and treatment of rheumatic gout ? —•
5220.
A cold, flatulent diet, immoderate indulgence
in acid liquors, and sudden exposure to variable
temperatures are contributing factors in rheu-
matic gout. Inheritance counts for much; the
uric-acid subject must take due precaution in
this respect. Take a mild saline such as
Glauber’s salt to a morning glass of hot water,
and avoid extremes in daily routine. For relief,
bathe the feet in a tepid soda bath at night,
massage upwards with equal parts olive oil and
methylated spirit after drying, and dust boracic
powder in the footwear daily. In diet, vege-
tables that grow above the ground are preferred
to root vegetables or tubers, but potatoes may
be taken in moderation if patient’s weight is
not excessive. Red meat and plain, unthick-
ened soups are permissible with one meal daily;
pastry and condiments are best avoided.
Constituents and test action of Fehling’s
solution ? —5227.
It consists of an alkaline solution of copper
sulphate added to an equal quantity of double
tartrate of potash and soda (Rochelle salt),
with a solution of caustic soda, which assists in
retaining the copper in solution as a copper
hydrate. If not freshly prepared a substance
may be formed which reduces the cupric hydrate
to a cuprous salt. It is used as a test for sugar
in urine and diabetic cases. The urine is added
to the solution, and red cuprous oxide is pre-
cipitated if sugar is present. Benedict’s quali-
tative test solution is a modification of the
same test. It contains copper sulphate, and,
in addition, sodium or potassium citrate and
anhydrous sodium carbonate.
I work in a fish shop. Can you tell me
how to remove the smell of fish from my
hands? Ordinary soaps are useless. —5126.
Soak for a few minutes completely immersed
in cold water; dab partly dry, then rub in a
teaspoon of glycerine. Massage well, then wash
thoroughly in hot water containing cloudy
ammonia, using a perfumed soap such as Col-
gate’s Cashmere Bouquet. Dry thoroughly, and
finish by rubbing with methylated spirits, a
few drops of oil of lavender or talcum powder.
(1) What is the significance of the cow sculp-
tured on the wall of Durham Cathedral ? (2)
Derivation of “lobscouse” ? —5229.
(1) It commemorates the legend that the
monks of Lindisfarne were led to the site of
the cathedral by a dun cow. (2) Nautical and
derisive phrase for “sailor’s hash,” from lob’s
(lubber’s) stew.
(1) What was the cause of the death of the
American novelist David Graham Phillips ?
(2) Age ? (3) What was his last published
book ? (4) Was “Susan Lenox” at any time
banned in the Commonwealth ? —5095.
(1) He was shot, Jan. 23, 1911, by a men-
tally deranged man, Fitzhugh Coyle Golds-
borough. (2) 43. (3) “Susan Lenox.” (4)
No.
What is the lona Cross, and where is it

How to remove cooking-fat from a glace-kid
boot?— sl3B.
Place brown paper over the leather, and iron
it with a fairly hot iron, the paper absorbing
the grease, but the iron must not be hot enough
to damage the leather; or you can wash the
boot in hot water with soap and borax, using
a small brush. This may destroy some of the
color, but a good polish should set that right.
Some glace-kids are very soft and porous, and
it may be impossible to get it clean.
How can I clean a canvas apron that has
been soaked with crude oil? —5185.
Soak in kerosene for a few hours, then work
it well in the hands and wring out; hang up
to dry. When almost dry, wash well in very
hot water containing a little washing soda —if
much soda is used a sticky mass will result.
If the apron is still oily, bring it to the boil
in water containing shredded soap and a little
ammonia. Rinse in hot water, then in cold, and
hang out.

£25 FOR SUCCESS STORIES.
Mostly Australia hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success —men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
“The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize £2O

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO CIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
FUTURE OF SUPERFINE WOOLS.
“Murrawong”: Unless manufacturers
show greater appreciation of superfine
wools, future breeding of fine types will
be confined to fanciers.
To-day, and for some time past, the
margin between prices for specialty lines
and for medium-fine warp types has been
so small as to reduce superfine growers
to despondency.
In New England (N.S.W.), a district
noted for well-grown, high-yielding,
superfine quality but anything but ideal
for sheep-breeding, it is doubtful if the
average weight of wool cut per sheep
amounts to 61b., compared with an aver-
age on lower altitudes of 81b.-141b. So
long as this sacrifice of quantity for
quality was recognised and recompensed
by woolbuyers, the New Englander was
content to carry on breeding ; but present
circumstances have swung so hard
against him that leading breeders are
already changing over, and it is only
a matter of time before the others will
follow. If present conditions persist,
New England will be given over to deal-
ing and pasturing wethers bred on the
plains and crossbreds.
Here is a comparison of prices re-
cently received for part of a well-known
N.E. clip. The station-bred wethers’ wool
was of 70-80’s quality, average length
3in., bright, free and high-yielding. A
second flock comprised young plains-
bred wethers carrying 14 months’ wool,
4in.-sin. in length, of 66-70’s quality and
lacking the bright, showy appearance of
the other.
Fleece. Necks. Bkn. Pcs.
Stn. W. 13H7d. 13fd. 13d. 9*d. per lb.
Bt. W. 14|-17d. Bid. per lb.
The station-bred wethers cut 81b. per
head, the bought wethers 111 b. Such
results must lead to the breaking-up of
some of the oldest fine-wool flocks.
Even though good prices for short super-
fine wools come back, it is doubtful
whether many would return to breeding
again. A good flock of ewes is the result
of years of patient work —they can sel-
dom be bought—and so long as good
wethers can be purchased around 10s.
off shears they represent a far better
return, with only a fraction of the work
and risk involved in raising lambs in
New England.
WET WOOL.
“Dead Finish”: “Murrawong” (B.
26/12/’34) says that if, after inspection
of wool, moisture is visible on the
classer’s hands “it is fair proof the wool
is not fit to press.”
If moisture is showing, either in wool
or on the hands, it is definitely unfit to
press. I have never had his headaches
over wet wool. If there is any doubt
about dampness the sheep are turned out
to dry. This much is expected of every
classer, not through fear of spontaneous
combustion, but because wool pressed in
this condition opens up for sale unattrac-
tively. The more moisture, the worse the
appearance. This is a simple business
axiom that every woolman should learn
early.
“Murrawong” recommends handling
sheep that have been out in rain imme-
diately they are brought into the shed.
This method will certainly account for
the headaches. No matter how carefully
the musterers handle a mob, the un-
avoidable bustling necessary to yard and
shed them, plus the sun heat on the damp
wool prior to yarding, leaves both sheep
and wool steamy and sweaty.
Under such conditions it is absolutely
impossible to gauge the moisture in the
fleeces, and most practical men will not
attempt it at this stage.
Ask any team of shearers to take a vote
on sheep just rushed into the shed, and
they may vote them wet, even when there
has been no rain at all. The Queensland
Pastoral Award stipulates for sheep at
all times to be in the yards four hours
before penning-up, to allow them to cool
down.
Only on rare occasions will shearers
consider handling sheep that have been
out drying and brought in during the day-
time. ,
WOOL CONTROL.
“Surat” wants a dispute settled;
Maranoa (Q.) Graziers’ Association has taken
a ballot on a questionnaire;
“Are you in favor of the appmntment
of a Commonwealth wool executive with
power to prohibit the export of wool except
under conditions as to a minimum reserve
price?”
Slightly under 40 p.c. voted “Yes,” but as a
large number neglected to vote this was suffi-
cient to give the “Yes” a slight majority.
The advocates for a minimum reserve price
now claim that their policy has been fully en-
dorsed, whereas their opponents deny this on
the ground that the questionnaire was ambigu-
ous and misleading.
What is the true interpretation of this vote?
It depends on the rules of the associa-
tion. If no minimum quota of votes is
established to make a poll valid, or if
there is and the requisite quota has voted,
“Yes” wins.
WATER-ROT AND FLY.
“Right Angle”: “Albarmount” (B.
9/1 / ’35), discussing “G.H.H.’s” par. (B.
19/12/’34) on rotten yolk, is sound when
he says water-rot in wool may be found
under both humid and dry conditions.
In big, plain-bodied, long-stapled merino
sheep in dry areas of South Aus., I
found broken-down yolk in its worst
form—green. But in M.L. this rot may
be found occasionally in long-wool
sheep exposed to excessive summer rains.
Apart from its deterioration of the
growing wool, caused by caking and re-
tarding of growth, over a most important
period—about three months before shear-
ing—pasty, suety and especially green
rot depreciates the whole clip value.
With green rotten yolk, such severe
measures have to be taken in the scour
that the vital elasticity of fibre is injured,
and at times destroyed.
The wool loses the peculiar softness,
known to woolmen as “kindness,” which
is a feature of all high-grade merino. It
is also much harder to estimate the
clean yield of pasty, suety wool. Buyers
avoid the green-rot fleeces, as, however
vigorous the treatment, the stain never
comes out.
BIRDS V. ’HOPPERS.
“Albarmount”: Results do not support
the theory that insectivorous birds, un-
checked by man, would provide “the one
trustworthy method of destroying dele-
terious insect life” (B. 16/l/’35). Birds
failed to prevent the ’hopper plague in
the late ’eighties, though rabbit-poison
baits, which are supposed to have wrought
wholesale destruction on bird life, were
then unthought of.
Again, the blowfly is severest on well-
improved properties where nothing has
been done to impair bird life for a
couple of decades. Here, of course, man
has added to fly trouble by stimulating
herbage growth.
It seems to me that the practical ex-
termination of the native cat, the lessen-
ing of goannas and the destruction of
sniper-trees for their natural enemy the
hawk has fully compensated for any loss
of birds destroyed by the old method of
phosphorus-pollard poisoning. Since the
rise in skins 15 years ago, 90 p.c. of the
rabbits destroyed are now either trapped,
dug out or poisoned with strychnine-
thistle-root baits. These methods are not
injurious to bird life. Yet there is no
noticeable increase in the number of
birds. And the ’hoppers and blowflies are
worse than ever.
SCELIO TO THE RESCUE.
“The 0.D.”: Introducing Scelio, a
good little Australian lady wasp, about
the size of a flying-ant, who has hopped
into the grasshopper eggbeds like a
goanna into a wild-duck’s nest. In
N.S.W. enormous numbers of her are
burrowing into the eggbeds, each laying
an egg on a grasshopper egg, so that
millions of her young will emerge instead
of ’hoppers.
Humid weather is causing heavy mor-
tality of young ’hoppers.
Though millions of the midsummer
brood will thus be accounted for, mil-
lions will survive, and landholders must
have their baits ready to save seedling
wheat and grass in the autumn. Despite
the critics, the N.S.W. departmental
method is the most efficient so far evolved
for agricultural areas, and many a man
now admits it saved his wheat and weeks
of feed this year.
PICKLED WHEAT.
“Tumbe Munda”: “Sorghum” (B.
26 /12/’34) says that wet pickled wheat
sown in dry ground has a tendency to
malt. I have concluded that the malting
bogey is like the sea-serpent—heard of,
but rarely seen.
The first wheat crop I sowed, in 1914,
I wet-pickled in weak bluestone solu-
tion, steeping each butt for 10 minutes.
I put the seed down within 12 hours in
dry ground, without any sign of malt.
Since then I have often sown wet wheat
in dry ground, but have never had malt,
though I have had dry wheat spoilt by
heavy rain just after sowing, the grains
swelling and cracking.
The boom in dry-pickling is waning in
my N.S.W. district; the wet method is
returning to favor because of its greater
reliability.
I have discarded the steeping of butts
of wheat in favor of turning the wheat
on a floor. Thus the grain is not soaked
as in steeping, air-bubbles are broken up
and there is a great saving of time.
I empty five bags of wheat, and have
a lOgal, copper full of 1 p.c. bluestone,
I pour some of the mixture on the wheat,
and with a shovel turn the heap over,
adding liquid. It needs doing thoroughly.
FULGHUM TO THE FRONT.
“Valerin”: The ideal oat for the mixed
farm is one that will stand grazing in
winter and give satisfactory yields of
hay and grain. Most varieties have
special merits, but the new N.S.W. de-
partmental “release” Fulghum seems to
combine the different qualifications.
Field plots in the Riverina, on the
South-western, Central-western and
North-western Slopes and as far back as
the Western Plains of N.S.W. suggest that
Fulghum is a good all-round oat. Very
little seed will be available this season,
but graziers should look ahead and book
up for the following seeding.
SURFACE EROSION.
“Valerin”: Most of the local dust-
storms in agricultural areas arise from
fallowed land, and thousands of tons of
soil must be blown away annually.
Considerable attention is being directed
to soil erosion brought about by rain
and stream action, but we hear little
about surface erosion, which is mainly
due to the wholesale denudation of stand-
ing timber on farms ; in his anxiety to
use every available acre the farmer has
used the axe and fire-shovel with deadly
effect.
There is tremendous scope for farm
reafforestation in the planting of shelter-
belts, windbreaks and timber for build-
ing and fuel.
LOADING LOOSE HAY.
“Lion”: The main point in loading
loose hay is to remember that it has got
to be unloaded.
The loader should start at one end of
the waggon, putting a pitch in each
corner and then one in the centre to bind
it. Continue down the waggon until the
other end is nearly reached. Turn round
and repeat the process backwards. Be
careful to keep the middle full.
Those pitching in the paddock often
lose sight of the fact that they should
place the pitches in their right position
on the load, and not expect the loader to
do it all —he often has not time in a heavy
crop and with several men pitching up.
No pitch should ever be put up behind
the man on the load. It makes the work
harder and causes time-loss.
Where men know their job they can
each load their own side as fast as they
can work, leaving the loader to keep the
load straight and the middle full. Hay
loaded by this method can be taken off

FLOODGATES.
“Doitnow”: Tell “Marsh” that his
suppositions regarding my floodgates (B.
19/12/’34) don’t work in practice. I
said (B. 21/11/ ’34) that “long, heavy
posts are sunk deeply into each side of
the creek bank and anchored securely
with wire.” If this is done and the rest
of the advice followed, it will resist any
reasonable flood. As the creek rises only
small debris is carried down. This piles
against the gate, which breaks down the
centre and swings free. When the flood
becomes fierce the big logs come down
and pass through an already opened gate.
They often go 10ft. over the tops of our
anchor-posts. These should not project
more than 4ft. from the level of the hole
in the bank. Our gate has been well
tried out.
In normal seasons we might have five
or six big floods down, and if we “called
fresh wire into use each time,” as
“Marsh” suggests, in preference to re-
claiming the old, the wire entanglement
at each gate can be well imagined.
We use the cable gate as well as our
own patent, but floods often take gate
and cable, because they are floods here.
SCRUB TICK CURES.
“L.G.”: It has been recently proved
by the Queensland Agricultural Depart-
ment that injections of Trypan blue are
a specific for tick poison in dogs, even
after paralysis has set in.
The injection is a two per cent, solu-
tion (about nine grains to the fluid
ounce). The blue is dissolved in boiling
water, allowed to cool and the sediment
removed by straining through a piece of
fine linen recently boiled. The hypo-
dermic syringe must also be boiled for
15 minutes.
The injection is made under the loose
skin behind the shoulder, the dose being
one teaspoonful for puppies up to five
teaspoonfuls for large full-grown dogs.
One dose is usually enough.
Regular dusting with derris-root
powder or a wash with derris paste every
four days is a preventive against tick in-
festation according to the Sydney Uni-
versity veterinary school.
WANTED, A HAYSHED.
“A.G.T.”; On many farms care is
taken to put machinery under cover from
the weather; yet hay, more vulnerable
than steel and wood, is left exposed.
Dobbin’s stomach is his most vital
part, and it is up to his owner to see that
only the best goes into it.
Seeing how mouldy hay can become
through being left exposed it is little
wonder that horses die.
With the spread of toxic-paralysis,
there is an increasing need for hay to
be kept in good condition. There should
be a hayshed on every farm.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Whalebone”: When salting St. John’s
wort place the salt in a shallow hole
around the roots. This prevents it being
washed away by heavy rains.
“Doitnow”: The milker who rubs
vaseline on the cleaned cow’s teats before
milking will never have sore-teat trouble.
“Wrash”: Gun-barrels or tools that
are rusted or grimed with forest gum or
dried oil may be cleaned with a halved
potato dipped into powdered Bath brick
or with block cleanser.
“Mulyan”: Many common weeds on
the farm make good green feed for
porkers, among them redweed, sow
thistles and pigweed.
“Agri”: Here is a cheap plough or
scarifier cushion: Cut a piece out of a
sheepskin to fit the seat, draw an
old cornsack over it and tie beneath
the seat. If the wool on the sheepskin
is short, two pieces may be used.
“Bundalinga”: Kurrajongs, being valu-
able fodder reserves, repay a little atten-
tion. Grubs attack the leaves. If in
small numbers the leaves should be cut
and burned in kerosene. For larger in-
vasions, spray with 11b. arsenate of lead
in 40gal. of water.
“Horsey”: Two cheap and effective
fly-veils: (1) To the winkers of draught
horses tie old binder bands by doubling
them and threading the two ends through
the loop thus formed, having the fore-
head band of the winkers between. This
is always ready for use and lasts well.
(2) Split a length of motor tube in half
down one side only. Then cut it into
strips like an ordinary leather veil, and
attach to the winkers or bridle. This
lasts for the season, provided a strong
tube is used.

A clean sweep should be made of all
pigs, boars and sows, and fresh stock
introduced. Do not allow the new stock
to run on the ground used for the abort-
ing pigs, as the infection can be picked
up from the pastures. Build a new pig-
gery on fresh country. Plough the old
paddocks, and grow at least one crop on
them before they are again used for pigs.

not be cured. When teaching a young
horse to lead, get him in a small yard
and keep pulling at him gently. Attach
the rope to a heavy bag of sand. Let
him try his weight on it for an hour or
so. Then tie him to a post. I have
known horses tied to a post at once to
injure their necks through the sudden

some “give” in it.

trouble through swallowing the fibres,
and I once knew of a cow that had a
frightful head through a band getting
round her horns, tightening on the skin
and causing a festering cincture that no-
body suspected until she was almost mad
with pain.

MAINTAINING HIGH AVERAGE SPEEDS.
SKILFUL CORNERING AND GOOD ACCELERATION DECIDING
FACTORS.
BY FRED BERRY.
THOUGH extremely high bursts of speed and terrific
acceleration are possible with the modern car, most
motorists are sceptical when drivers, as so many of them do,
on returning from a long tour, glibly quote high AVERAGE
speeds. As every competition driver knows to his cost, there
are a host of pitfalls lying in wait for careless assessors of speed
averages.
First thing to remember is that each
mile consists of 1760 yards ; not what
you might guess it to be, what the
speedometer registers or what the road-
guide indicates. In cases where distances
are guessed, it is but human nature to
give oneself the benefit of fractions,
which make quite a difference in compu-
tation. Where speedometer readings are
taken it should be realised that these
instruments are seldom correct, and even
when carefully calibrated a month’s tyre
wear will make an appreciable variation.
Furthermore, trip-mileages and miles-
per-hour readings on a speedometer are
in no way connected. One may be cor-
rect whilst the other is hopelessly astray.
Speedometer Errors.
So far as miles per hour is concerned,
tests of new cars over The Bulletin
course show that it is but seldom that
an instrument registers truly over more
than half its speed range. Almost in-
variably on approaching the 50 mark the
margin of error ranges from five to 2Q
per cent., and in one instance in a test
over a measured mile the stopwatch
showed 63 m.p.h., while the hand on
the speedometer dial was gaily waving
between 85 and 90.
False readings of this nature are com-
mon, and tempt inexperienced drivers

to make absurd statements as to average
speeds. Motorists who have a genuine
desire to tell the truth about such per-
formances must make perfectly certain
of the exact distance travelled and the
time occupied to the nearest minute. It
is absurd to guess at either of these
factors.
So much for the time and distance
elements in assessing averages. ThQ pur-
pose of this article is to show how good
results may be achieved without taking
undue risks or breaking traffic regula-
tions.
Flexibility.
Time was when the car was neither as
flexible nor as roadworthy as it is to-
day, and those desirous of bettering 30
m.p.h. for a 200-mile trip had perforce
to drive at the maximum on every
straight stretch of road. To average 30
even five years ago meant many miles
at 60 to compensate for the long grinds
up steep grades, slowing on corners and
poor acceleration. Now motors are so
wonderfully responsible to the throttle,
brakes so efficient and acceleration so
good that one may, with skilful steering,
maintain an average of 40 even over diffi-
cult highway without once exceeding a
maximum of 50 miles an hour.
During these speedy trips there can,
of course, be no time wasted at wayside
inns, nor can stops be made for refuelling
or tyre changes, as when calculating
average speeds for any journey all halts,
voluntary or otherwise, must be included
in the time. It would be absurd to claim
some particular average after having de-
ducted, at your own discretion, half an
hour for lunch, ten minutes for fuel and
oil and another ten for refreshments.
These halts must be debited to the
account and made up by good driving
further along the road.
Smart Acceleration.
Apart from the personal satisfaction
derived by the individual motorist in
setting up a meritorious road average,
there is another and extremely important
aspect of the matter seldom realised by
the man in the street. With the rapid
increase in the number of motors using
the highways, the problem of congestion
becomes vital,
and the only
s a t i sfactory
solution lies in
speeding up
the traffic
flow. Fortu-
nate 1 y, this
ideal condi-
tion does not
of necessity de-
mand absurdly
high maximum
speeds, but it
does call for
snappy accel-
e r a ti o n be-
tween, say, 30
and 50 m.p.h.
In this connection latest files from
overseas give prominence to an address
by H. L. Pomeroy, one of the leading
authorities on automotive design. He
urged manufacturers to concentrate upon
acceleration rather than maximum speed.
In perusing accounts of road tests of
1935 models one cannot but be impressed
with the general improvement in times
recorded through gears from 0 to 50
m.p.h.—the real basis of high average
speeds. Few will, however, be fortunate
enough to drive “super” motors, and as
a consequence those desiring fast times
between points will have to make up for
mechanical deficiencies by driving skill.
They will have to master the art of cor-
nering, and be careful, not in how often
they drive fast, but in how seldom they
slow up.
Scientific Cornering.
A driver who makes a study of cor-
nering will maintain a 10-mile higher
average on corners than will the hap-
hazard motorist, and as a result will
have no reason at any time to drive
wildly on straight stretches.
There is one other aspect of speed
driving, particularly in connection with
averages, that should appeal to every keen
motorist. When speed records are at-
tempted the competitor is required to
cover a distance of one mile in opposite
directions and over the same ground in
order to compensate for possible assist-
ance from wind. The racing driver may

do the measured mile against a strong
wind in 45 seconds, giving an average
speed of 80 miles per hour. In the
reverse direction, with the wind behind,
the distance may be clocked in 30 sec-
onds, averaging 120 m.p.h. In comput-
ing the result it has been the custom to
take the mean of 80 and 120, giving an
average of 100 m.p.h. Calculated along
these lines many world’s records have
been claimed, but in actual fact the re-
sults are incorrect. The car has covered
two miles in 75 seconds —one in 30 and
another in 45, so giving a mean speed
of 96 m.p.h. and not 100.
Calculating Averages.
Bringing this aspect of the matter into
the tourist’s problem we can take as an
illustration one mile at 30 m.p.h., occupy-
ing two minutes, and in the reverse direc-
tion one mile at 60 m.p.h., taking one
minute. The popular supposition would
be that with one mile at 60 and another
at 30 the average would be 45, whereas
actually the two miles occupied three
minutes, giving an average speed of 40
m.p.h. Timekeepers in future record-
breaking attempts might with advantage
consider the implications of this method
of computation.
Returning now to the man with a
standard car, let us take the case of a
driver who sets out on a 20 m.p.h.
schedule. Meeting rough going for a mile
he slows down to 10 m.p.h. in order to
avoid putting his passengers through the
roof. How many miles would he need
to cover at 30 in order to regain his set
average?
Ask any motorist this question and
almost certainly he will reply that one
mile at 10 and one at 30 will give an
average of 20. As a matter of fact, the
ensuing three miles will need to be cov-
ered at 30 in order to get back to time,
proving that delays of even minor nature
must be studiously avoided if a set
average is to be maintained,
_ . .
Recover.ng Lost T.me.
Minor delays are seldom of great irn-
portance to a motorist on tour, but in
railroad practice, where a strict schedule
of times must be rigidly adhered to,
minutes lost must be regained as quickly
as possible.
In this connection the French Dia-
gramme DTvatt, used by Continental
locomotive drivers when for any reason
they are forced to make good delays,
should be of interest to motorists. Here
the top row of figures indicates miles an
hour, and the remainder is plotted to in-
dicate the number of miles at increased
speed necessary to make good a delay of
one minute. For example, a motorist
who elected to drive at a 20 m.p.h. aver-
age and who was delayed for 10 minutes
in changing a tyre must cover the next
16.7 miles at 25 m.p.h., or 10 miles at
30 m.p.h., 6.6 miles at 40 or 5 miles at
60 before he comes on time again.
City Driving.
In city driving, of course, average
speeds suffer in comparison with those
usually obtained upon country roads, but
here again the careful motorist who con-
tinually maintains an even pace and is

the knock. (2) Plug points 20-24 thou., distribu-
tor make-and-break adjustment four thou, less

causing overheating when hard driven.

“V.E.”: That stalled Chev. referred
to by “Speeding Parson” (B. 2/1 /’35)
stopped with a steaming motor. The
pores of the rubber-covered spark leads
were opened ; rain pelted on to the bon-
net, reducing temperature suddenly and
condensing moisture internally, whilst
most likely a fine rain mist blew in
through the louvres. The rubbered leads,
with their closing pores, absorbed some
of the moisture. Then the 30,000-volt
sparks decided to hop for home over the
damp surfaces instead of across the plug
gap. The porcelain also was damp. The
whirring fan helped eventually to equal-
ise internal and external bonnet tempera-
tures, thus drying the leads. Earthing
the battery was like putting liniment on
a wooden leg. Old hands in Moreton
Bay (and the recruits to this trick,
may I add, are legion) carry a bottle of
metho. and a hunk of waste to wipe the
salt moisture from the plugs and leads
after a stoppage. A little more com-
monsense and less bone-pointing are
what electrical appliances require.

The old radiator cannot handle the output

Remedy cannot be carried out with home equip-
ment. Method used is to place the radiator in
a special chemical bath for six to ten hours
with continual agitation, after which the cores
are blown out with a high-pressure air-and-
water jet. Repeated flushing with strong caustic
solution might in time partly relieve the trouble.

In common with other board agents,
except Fresh Food and Ice, Dairy
Farmers, according to the commissioner,
have “committed breaches either of the
Milk Act or of their agency agree-
ments” ; but they have suffered no
penalty as far as the public knows.
Nevertheless, a penalty was imposed on
them at Newtown the other day. Milk
containing 9 p.c. of added water had
been sold from one of their depots to
an inspector. The explanation was that
ice had slipped into a vat after all ven-
dors had been supplied, which shows
carelessness, anyhow. There were previ-

gated nearly 190,000 cwt., valued at
£530,000, imports of fresh and preserved
fish totalled 80,500 cwt., valued at £270,000.

The Luck of Dairy Farmers
Under the control system introduced
by Lang Labor and continued by the
present Government, Sydney has to pay
7d. a quart for country milk which, if
it were a free market —subject, of course,
to inspection and regulation designed to
ensure purity of supplies—would be dear
at sd. Milk has been “controlled” for
three years. During that time endow-
ment tax has been abolished. Common-
wealth and State income taxes have been
reduced, and wages have been cut in the
trade, but the price remains at 7d. a
quart.
A concern called the Dairy Farmers’
Co-operative Milk Co. is the principal
beneficiary. It has been lucky in divers
ways. Lang Laborites used to delight
in attacking it. Nevertheless, their Gov-
ernment appointed one of its two joint
managers, Mr. Hamilton, chairman of
its milk board. In the words of A. B.
Shand, K.C., who in 1933 was given a
commission to inquire into the adminis-
tration of the Lang Milk Act,
The appointment.... was approved by
Cabinet on December 28, 1931. From De-
cember 29 onwards large sums of money
belonging to Dairy Farmers had been made
available to themselves by the joint
managers.... It was alleged that these
moneys were used in payment of special
cash rebates to customers.... Mr. Hamil-
ton said that he paid away between £lOOO
and £1500... .At the inquiry Mr. Hamilton
was asked to name customers to whom he
had paid these cash rebates. He named
some 40 persons to whom he believed he
had paid them, although he could not
positively swear. All, with the exception
of two absent in the country, were called
and, with the exception of three, denied that
they had received any cash rebates.
Mr. Hamilton’s appointment was
gazetted on January 8, 1932. Says the
Royal Commissioner:
In February, 1932, Mr. Hamilton pressed
for the appointment of Dairy Farmers as
the sole agent of the board.... Mr. Hamil-
ton believed that the fewer agents appointed
the better the service, and Dairy Farmers,
which had by far the largest milk business,
were the most suitable.... There was no
improper preference by Mr. Hamilton.
Mr. Hamilton knew, however, that
Dairy Farmers and other concerns were,
or had been, “standardising” milk.
Some “standardised” by running separ-
ated milk into milk intended for con-
sumption.
Dairy Farmers have adopted another but
equally effective method. When the milk
arrives in vats on railway trucks the cream
* has naturally risen to the surface. They
pump the lower and weaker contents into
other milk intended for consumption, and
then pump the upper layer for separation
for cream. Each method, in my opinion,
offends against the Pure Food Act.
The Commissioner pronounced him-
self “satisfied that Dairy Farmers have
not, since being appointed agents, made
any substantial profits from ‘standardi-
sation.’ ” But they made a tidy profit on
another transaction:
Dairy Farmers, instead of buying all the
milk to be used by them for their sweet-
cream supplies, bought 35,000 gallons of
cream from three suppliers on the South
Coast. They did not inform the board.
The Railway Department charges freight
for milk at a mileage rate, irrespective of
whether the vats in the trucks are full, and
allows cans of cream to be carried between
the vats free of cost. Dairy Farmers took
advantage of this permission, and the cream
did not pay any freight. The cost of the
cream to the company was at the rate of
6s. 3d. a gallon, whereas if it had been
purchased under the board’s direction the
cost would have been 7s. 6d.
Six and three a gallon; and Dairy
Farmers charge the consumer 7d. a

question of whether local fisheries can
be expanded to supply the State’s short-
age. The deep-sea fishing grounds close
to Sydney have been seriously depleted,
and the Commonwealth Government —
always the Commonwealth! —has been
approached at various times with the sug-
gestion that a survey-ship be fitted out
for the purpose of locating new fishing
grounds. The bureau is of the belief that
the fishing industry off the Australian
coast is capable of great development.

“Abra”: Someone in nearly every
country is hollering for a “new deal,” a
“national dividend” or a “reform of the
capitalistic system.” The more ridi-
culous the proposal the more adherents
there seem to be. The last half-century
has shown an enormous increase in the
world’s manufacturing capacity, the
ramifications of trade and the interfer-
ence of Governments with private indus-
try. Life grows more complex every
day, and its complexities are multiplied
by taxgatherers. Levying taxes irre-
spective of the justice of the levy or its
effect on commercial welfare has helped
to breed a deep-seated feeling of “To

The mining-share market has been
passing through a very sluggish period ;
the flotation business was overdone.
Lately there has been something of a
recovery, and new floats are again com-
ing forward. The factor which last year
threatened to kill the golden goose is
again noticeable —excessive capitalisations
and promoters’ considerations. Vendors
of resuscitated mines and speculative
“finds” demand the greater part of
their whack in cash, not being content to
take scrip and wait for the market to
appraise its value. Heavy considerations,
particularly the cash part, don’t inspire
confidence.

“Comptometer”: As the Federal Gov-
ernment has promised a “monetary
inquiry,” it might consider in the
programme a scheme for decimal-
isation of the currency. The bread
rumpus in N. S. Wales has shown
the need, if not of farthings, of a currency
system more adaptable to dealings in
small values. The time for decimalisa-
tion has never been more opportune.
Our pound is no longer equal fo the
pound sterling ; on a basis of price levels
it may never equal it again. Our silver
coinage need not be altered, except that
the threepenny-bit would call for a
modification. The pound—what about
another name for it, anyway? —would be
subdivided into 10 florins, as at present;
the florin could be divided into 100
further units of .24d. each, and a 10-unit
piece (=2.4d.) could take the place of the
threepenny-piece. The pound (call it
an “emu” or a “kanga” if you like) and
the florin need not be altered. The
present three money columns in account-
books could be retained ; pounds, florins,
“units”—loo “units” = one florin, 10
florins = one pound. The present sub-
division of our coinage is clumsy, costly
and uneconomic.

CHEVROLET LEADS
with Stronger, More Accessible Back Axle
What a massive looking back axle! Just the back axle a hard-
working truck should have. No right-angle joins ... no split
casing ... no maze of nuts and bolts . . , instead it’s a one-piece
banjo type back axle. A strong yet simple design with which
Chevrolet won its place as the largest selling truck in the world.
Here are the advantages of the Chevrolet rear axle construction
•—advantages a practical man will appreciate:
1. Banjo type differential construction allows easy adjustment.
2. Adjustment of crown wheel and pinion can be effected
quickly and economically.
3. One-piece stamping of rear axle casing for greater strength.
4. The absence of right-angle joints in the casing ensures
adequate strength for all loads.
And in the Chevrolet engine the same evidence of dependable
construction is seen. It’s a valve-in-head six—time-proven and
mile-proven. Big enough for full power and ample speed—yet
economical to run. Right through, these husky Chevrolet trucks
lead in features, and whether you operate one truck or a fleet, you
can haul any kind of load at lower cost with Chevrolet.
The range includes the 30 cwt. model in 131-inch wheelbase; the 2-tonner in 131 -inch
and 157-inch wheelbases; the new 2\ ton heavy duty “Mapleleaf” with full floating rear
axle; the 3-5 ton semi-trailer; and a comprehensive range of Utilities.

THE COMMUNICATOR A.C. THREE.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Using the 2.5-volt series of valves, and following the principle of the
Wide-World series of short-wave receivers, the Communicator A.C. Three
receiver has several interesting features. It is self-contained, including a
midget dynamic speaker on the panel, has provision for headphone
reception as desired, and avoids switched-circuit complications by the use
of plug-in coils .
Since the writer introduced, the Wide-
World series of receivers to Bulletin
radio readers the popularity of R.F.
pentode valves used in the form of elec-
tron-coupled detector has been very
marked. It so happened that in the
Wide-World designs 6.3-volt valves were
Fig. 1. —The Communicator is a
three-valve regenerative receiver with
electron-coupled detector, using 2.5-
volt valves, and for speaker or head-
phone operation.
used, mainly with an eye to the require-
ments of country folk. That is a most
useful feature of the “auto” valves (if
you don’t use too many at once); a 6-
volt accumulator provides the heater cur-
rent nicely. The same valves are also
hum-free performers with A.C. on the
heaters. There are a lot of experimenters
who, however, have on hand suitable 2.5-
volt valves, and shoals of letters have
reached the writer asking if the 57 can
be used instead of the 77 and the 56
instead of the 37, etc. There would not
be any need to ask such questions if all
and sundry had copies of the excellent
Radiotron characteristic charts, reference
to which would show that the valves (and
other prototypes) are the same thing with
a different heater. But not all have the
charts, and so, in response to numerous
requests, a Wide-World type of receiver
has been designed to use the 2.5-volt
valves. It is built “all in one piece” on
the one chassis. Although by making it
thus, instead of having a separate power-
pack chassis linked by a plug and cable,
construction is simplified, extra care
must be taken to keep A.C. hum away
from the R.F. circuits, and, above all, to
include precautions against “tunable
hum.” “Tunable hum” is that annoying
business of hum appearing at different
points on various short-wave bands with
the detector just oscillating. A few extra
by-passes at appropriate points, as in the
Fig. 2.

circuit diagram of Fig. 1, will completely
rout this trouble.
Explaining the Circuit Essentials.
There is nothing about this Communi-
cator receiver of a complicated nature.
There is plenty of room above and below
the chassis for everything, and there is
no crowding of components. Hence the
generous chassis dimensions. Cramp a
regenerative short-wave receiver on a
small chassis uncomfortably mixed up
with its power transformer, rectifier and
filter, and H-U-M becomes its first name.
Use more space and a little common-
sense in layout and wiring, and it will
behave just like a battery model.
The power supply is quite straight-
forward. A Creela transformer is used,
385 volts per side, a 5-volt 80 rectifier
winding and a 2.5-volt winding at 6 amps.
If this latter is not centre-tapped the
usual 50-ohm C.T. resistor earthed
across the winding will do the same thing
electrically. Three 8-mfd. electrolytics
are used, with a 30-henry choke, plus
the field of the 2500-ohm midget
dynamic speaker in series, and one
of these 8-mfd. condensers buffering
the two. Normally this would, for ordi-
nary broadcast purposes, give a perfectly
hum-free power unit, but there are addi-
tional precautions
in this case.
Note that some
,1-mfd. conden-
sers are included.
Two are used
across the high-
voltage second-
ary, each side to
centre-tap (earth),
and similarly
with the heater
winding (2.5
volts) for the re-
ceiver valves.
These are the
“tunable - hum”
killers, and the
constructor is im-
plored not to
omit them. The
receiver itself is
a three-valve ar-
rangement com-
prising E-C re-
generative detec-
tor (57), with
correct audio coupling, a 56-buffer
audio stage and a 2A5 pentode out-
put feeding the midget speaker. By
fitting a miniature double-pole, double-
throw knife-switch on the back of
the chassis, plus a pair of insulated
terminals, headphones can be used
in the plate circuit of the 56. Thus the
keen short-wave listener who likes to
search the air at hours when the house-
hold normally sleeps keeps his loud-
speaker mute, and avoids domestic wrath.
Starting at the aerial circuit, coupling
is normally through a two-plate midget
condenser, and anything larger than this
is unnecessary; in fact, with too large
a capacity here, the detector will quit
oscillation at resonant points in various
bands, due to aerial overload. A sepa-
rate inductive coupling is shown in dotted
lines. This is merely a suggestion for
use with doublet aerials, as so many
people are trying them. Such a coil will
have to be variably coupled. It can
consist of a large-diameter former, with
about six turns of 28 D.S.C.. arranged
so that the plug-in grid-and-cathode coil
plugs through it to the coil mounting.
Variable coupling can be arranged in a
variety of ways, and that is left to the
ingenuity of the experimenter. The vari-
able condenser C is the tuning con-
denser, and Cl a shunted 3-plate midget
for bandspreading (vernier tuning). C
should have a capacity between .00014
and .000175 maximum. The condenser
used in the original is a cut-down broad-
cast condenser of ancient but solid make ;
the Wetless Co. (N.S.W.) has since pro-
duced something really good in short-
wave tuning condensers (illustrated in
trade section, B. 16/1/’35). The 20-
plate size will be correct for C.
To avoid difficulty in securing the
parts to make this receiver, the best
scheme is to buy from a co-operating
trader. The complete kit of parts for
the Communicator can be obtained
from the Wholesale Radio Co., 29
Rowe-street, Sydney, which is special-
ising in this model.
The coils, details of which are given
later, are exactly the same as for the
Wide-World Two. The grid condenser
is a .0001-mfd. mica (not marked)
bridged by a 2-meg. grid leak. Re-
generation is controlled by a 50,000-
ohm Yaxley potentiometer in the
screen-grid circuit. This make of
potentiometer is beautifully smooth
and constant in action, and is strongly
recommended. The R.F. choke in
the detector-plate circuit is important.
Any old thing won’t do. This is a
three-section honeycomb made especi-
ally for short-wave circuits. The
.0001-mfd. filter condenser from the 57
plate to earth should not be omitted,
as, with the R.F. choke, it plays an im-
portant part in keeping R.F. in its
right place. Because a fairly high
initial plate voltage is available, re-
sistance coupling can be used for the 57,
but for maximum efficiency from this
valve the high-impedance choke coupling
is far better. A.W.A. makes just the thing
for this purpose, and this particular choke
is desirable in an A.C. circuit, as it is
completely screened.
Note that the detector is also decoupled
by the inclusion of the 5000-ohm resistor
and 2-mfd. condenser in series with the
audio choke. This decoupling also
materially assists in reducing hum, and
the larger the by-pass here the better.
Voltage distribution is taken through

chassis between detector and buffer audio valves. The aerial-
coupling condenser is arranged on a hakelite bracket on the
coil mounting.
two 3-watt resistors of 15,000- and 10,000-
ohms value respectively, the regeneration
potentiometer being connected across the
junction of the two. The two resistors,
being across B positive and negative
(earth), are also a bleeder system. The
usual cathode-bias arrangement is used
for the 56, and the values of the resistors
in the plate circuit of this valve are
shown in the diagram. Decoupling is
also used here, and is still in use when the

Constructional Points and Coil Data.
The various views of the Communica-
tor show clearly just how it is laid out,
and that all valves, with the exception of
the 80 rectifier, are in screening cans.
In the case of the 2A5 the screening can
is just an extra precaution in anticipation
of possible A.C. hum getting to the grid
from the rectifier in close proximity. The
tuning dials call for comment. Those
used in the original were types on hand
in the lab. The old type of tuning dial
can be substituted by a more modern
aero dial with advantage, and most of
these newer dials have particularly-
smooth motion and ample reduction for
short-wave tuning. The bandspread
dial is a micro-vernier, but here again
an ordinary dial can be used. The micro
dial is not a huge advantage in this case.
as the band-spread capacity
is small enough for any ver-
nier dial. In the underneath
view of the chassis it will be
seen that the regeneration
potentiometer is arranged
on a bracket with an ex-
tension shaft and coupling.
This is not at all necessary,
but was so fitted by the
writer during experimenta-
tion with a variation of
screen-grid control wherein
hand-capacity was trouble-
some. As the rotor of the
potentiometer is virtually at
earth-capacity, being
shunted by a 1-mfd. con-
denser, the potentiometer
can be mounted directly at
the front of the chassis by its one-hole
fixing. As another precaution against
hum the heater wiring from power trans-
former to valve sockets is enclosed in
, . , , ~ , .
copper braid and earthed. This may not
be essential, but is worth consideration.
.... . . ,
The plug-m coil mounting is, as m the
Wide-World receivers, with the four-pin
soc ket fitted above the chassis top on
bakelife stand-off pillars. This keeps the
coil reasonably clear of metal, and makes
for short and direct wiring. It should be
unnecessary to stress the need for wiring
, ~ . ...
as short, rigid and direct as possible in
the detector circuit. Gauge- 16 tinned
copper is used for connecting between
coil and condensers etc There is no
coil ana condensers, etc. mere is no
need to insulate the Yaxley potentl-
ometers from the chassis, as the rotor is
insulated internally in the potentiometer.

A coil for the broadcast band is de-
tailed because so many people ask for it,
and, after all, a regenerative three-valve
receiver can often give quite good en-
tertainment on the local broadcasters.
Selectivity is, however, another matter
near to stations, but some astonishing re-
sults can be obtained with a receiver of
this nature on the broadcast band in
country towns away from broadcasting
centres. These remarks must not be
taken to mean that the Communicator
is designed as anything else than a very
good power-operated short-wave receiver.
As for aerials, the reader must suit his
own requirements according to space
available. No more than 50ft. of aerial,
including the lead-in, should be neces-
Fig. 6.
sary, and the earth should be a really
good one, and as direct as possible. For
the doublet aerial system, 35 feet per side
with twisted feeders of almost any length
to the coupling coil would give peak
results between 25 and 35 metres ; but
not everybody is in a position to erect a
doublet. If the aerial must, of necessity,
be indoors, provided the overall length
is no more than about 20 feet, coupling
direct to the cath-
ode of the detec-
tor can be tried.
This usually gives
a strong signal,
but if the aerial
is too long the
detector may re-
fuse to oscillate
in spots. The re-
sults to be ex-
pected with the
Communicator
are on a par with
those of the
Wide-World Two,
which means
extra good, but
extra good plus,
by reason of the
speaker reproduc-
tion and power-
point operation.
Whatever short-
wave overseas
stations are nor-
ma 11 y audible,
you may be sure that the Communi-
cator is capable of passing them on to
the speaker in fine style.
D. B. KNOCK.
What’s What in Radio.
The first international radio amateur
meeting conducted by radio took place
on Friday, January 18, between 10 p.m.
and 11.30 p.m., S.M.T., when by cour-
tesy of Amalgamated Wireless and
General Electric 'Stations VK2ME and
W2XAF, famous in the realms of short-
wave listeners, were placed at the dis-
posal of two groups of amateurs. The
meeting was conceived by the American
amateurs, who, in a message from
W2XAF to VK2ME, asked particularly
to meet the Zero Beat Radio Club and
The Bulletin’s radio editor, D. B.
Knock (VK2NO). Proceedings opened
with a talk by the president of the
Schenectady Amateur Radio Association,
followed by a discourse on the activities
of Zero Beat by Cam Moginie (VK2CN).
Next was a description of 5-metre
activity in U.S.A., followed by comments
on 5- and 10-metre work in Australia by
Mr. Knock. At this stage, one of the
W2XAF engineers described that station,
his remark, “after the push-pull i-kw.
stages we get out of the amateur class,”
leaving the Australian group envious, 25
watts being the order of things here. The
Zero Beat Club transmitter was next
described ably by J. Hutchinson (VK2JH)
and G. Kempton, and the meeting con-
cluded with the impressions of an Eng-
lish amateur, Mr. Bourne, of Rugby,
then visiting Schenectady. Mr. Lang-
ford-Smith, of A.W.A. staff, also at
W2XAF, conversed with Mr. Farmer,
chief of VK2ME. Weather comparisons
showed high winds and snowstorms at
the American end and a sultry night in
Sydney.
The Q. and A. Column.
Please illustrate a circuit of an efficient
crystal set and a simple _ one-valve set. —220.
Circuits were given in this section, B. 5/12/’34
and 29/8/’34 respectively. Copies may be
obtained from this office.
In the signal generator described B.
12/9/’34, what is the capacity of the variable
condenser? This was not stated. —221.
Capacity is .0005 mfd.
Fig. 7. —Underneath the receiver. The 30-henry filter choke
may be seen in the right-hand top corner, and the high-
impedance audio choke in the left-centre. The choke used
in this original receiver was an unscreened type, and the
A.W.A. screened choke is recommended. This will be
mounted on top of the chassis.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
It was thought at the beginning of the
season that The Marne (Heroic —Kal-
yanni) might turn out a Derby colt. Like
many another smart two-year-old, he
failed in point of stamina, but he has
proved himself a sprinter of parts.
Though not so blooming in appearance
as he was in the spring, he was equal to
winning the A.J.C. Challenge Stages at
20 to 1, All the honors of the race were
with the chestnut. He was badly served
in a scrambling start, but his rider, Weiss,
kept him on the rails, and when Vista
(6 to 1) shifted out at the Leger The
Marne almost scraped the paint off the
fence in getting through. He quickly
settled Vista, and, withstanding a strong
challenge from Veilantif (15 to 1), beat
that mare by nearly a length in Imin.
lOJsec., time which equalled the track
record. Roman Spear, coming fast at
the finish, dead-heated with Vista for
third. Then followed Dame Moab, Emily
Rose, Sir John, Regular Bachelor and
Bachian.
Backers of the favorite, Emily Rose,
were unlucky. She missed the jump, was
checked several times before turning for
home, and had to be checked again at
the Leger. Kaylah, Porcia, Sir John and
Roman Spear also met with trouble, and,
considering the smallness of the field, it
was a really rough race. Sir John was
the aristocrat of the party. It was his
first run for a long time, and he looked
big, but his strong finish from the top
of the straight suggests an early victory.
Perhaps in Melbourne.

As a yearling The Marne was bought
by William Kelso for 550 guineas and
turned over to A. B. Abel, a Sydney
businessman, who had a decent win at
long prices. Kelso had his customary
tenner on.
Hope was all the rage for the January
Handicap, being backed from sixes to
threes. Slow off the mark, the little chest-
nut beat only three home. Hugh Deni-
son’s Dark Chief (4 to 1) looked the
goods as he swung into the straight with
a clear lead, but, only a one-pace horse,
he was passed by High Cross (8 to 1)
and Contact (20 to 1), who could not be
separated as they flashed by Dudley
Smith, Dark Chief, on the rails, was a
close third, and Regal Star a poor fourth.
Pratt, rider of High Cross, entered a pro-
test, but it was quickly dismissed. There
had been a little jostling near the judge.
Bombus (4 to 1) proved too solid for
the favorite, King’s Head, in the Bondi
Handicap. He had been set a severe task
by Darby Munro, who bounced him out
at barrier-rise and never let up until
the winning post was passed. Sylvan-
dale was supported from 15 to 1 to eights.
After making a fast run on the outside
he tired, but got third. Trick’s fourth
is worth keeping in mind for a minor
event, especially as it was a fast-run race
■—“seven” in 1.24*.
Hunter White’s Tippler—Figure colt
Hadrian followed up his Warwick Farm
win by annexing the Widden Handicap,
at twos. The Queenslander Ben Field was
made favorite, but after he had chased
Hadrian for five furlongs his nine stone
anchored him, Hadrian is very speedy.
Grand Mogul and Fanfare filled the
places ; the latter, having his first race,
came home like an old-stager.
Tellano, who was once trained at
Randwick by Frank McGrath, sent the
bookies home rejoicing by scoring in the
Paddington Handicap at 33 to 1, with
few takers. The tote paid £24 7s. 6d.
and £7 9s. 6d. for 10s. Ex-jockey Jack
Mason has Tellano now, but he was so
disgusted with his failure in novice com-
pany at Warwick Farm that he allowed
the brute to run for the prize alone. Reg
Marsden took Tellano to the front at
barrier-rise, and he held off Impasto (10
to 1), with Ranchero (6 to 1) a close
third, Ranchero was almost knocked
over along the back stretch.
The second day at Randwick was an-
other day of surprises, the flat-racing be-
ginning unpalatably for backers with the
victory of Golden Gate (14 to 1) in the
Kurnell Handicap. Then Capris (5 to 2
on) was downed by Limyris (6 to 1) in
the Adrian Knox Stakes, and Miss Not-
tava (15 to 1) led home the Anniversary
Handicap field from Mainlaw and High
Cross —two horses that have been as con-
sistent this season as the mare has been
inconsistent.
;I? sj; t •(’
Light was thrown on autumn carnival
prospects at Moonee Valley last Saturday
when Heros (Heroic —Loversland) easily
captured the William Reid Stakes (six
furlongs). Carrying weight-for-age, the
gelding shot past Melason in the straight
and won by two lengths, with Arachne
more than a length away. The time v/as
Imin. 13sec., equalling that of Figure
when she beat Greenline in 1930. The
record for the William Reid Stakes (Imin.
12|sec.) was established by the sire of
Heros in 1927. Had Heros been pushed
he might have done even better.
Jack Holt possesses a strong hand in
the Newmarket with Press Gang, Heros
and Some Hero. He also has Chelandric
engaged, but that costly three-year-old
may be negligible. Chelandric was given
rather a lengthy spell before being taken
in hand again recently. Press Gang,
Heros and Chelandric are Oakleigh Plate
candidates, but Some Hero was not
nominated for the 5£ furlongs flutter. All
the horses mentioned run in different in-
terests. Press Gang belongs to A. T.
Craig, Heros to Mrs. L. R. Buxton, Some
Hero to W. M. Gollan (of Sydney) and
Chelandric to C. B. Kellow.
Press Gang, as winner of the Standish
Handicap, might seem a better sprinter
than his stable-companions. However,
Heros will command a big following in
the Newmarket on his Valley form. Be-
cause Arachne met Heros on 91b. worse
than weighf-for-age terms, J. A. Donohoe
did not fancy his filly for the William
Reid Stakes. Newly arrived from Sydney,
she may have been backward in condi-
tion. Arachne conceded Melason 51b. and
a year in age. Ordinarily that would not
have prevented her from outspeeding the
Blackadder gelding. No doubt David-
son refrained from unduly taxing the
powers of his mount. Arachne will be
seen to better advantage before long.
Newmarket weights are due on Monday
next, and trainers then will have nothing
to fear from showing their hands.
Holt had quite a field-day at the
Valley. He landed the juvenile event
with Mooramong, the William Reid
Stakes with Heros, and ran third in the
Cranmallan Trial with Danger Line. Last-
named is by Heroic from Miss Pinker-
ton, and was bred by C. B. Kellow, who
raced both sire and dam. Mooramong,
a colt by Ronsard from Ble d’Or, by
Buckwheat, was bred by the V.R.C.
chairman, L. K. S. Mackinnon, and car-
ries his colors. Improved by three previ-
ous outings, in the most recent of which
he finished a good second at Caulfield,
Mooramong was made a hot favorite,
and he justified expectations. Third was
Jamah Var, a 50-to-l chance. Jamah
Var had never sported silk before. She
is by Moabite (sire of Dark Sky) from
Mufti, who ran third in the Melbourne
Cup of 1922, and was retired to the stud
soon afterwards.
Memories of Phar Lap were revived
when Petit Fils landed the first division
of the Warrook Highweight at Moonee
Valley in the historic red, black and white
hooped sleeves, red cap. A promising
display in good company at Caulfield on
the previous Saturday caused Petit Fils
to be installed at the head of the quotes,
and he gave McShortodds a pain in the
midriff by being the fourth successive
favorite to score. Backed down to 9 to 4
for the Caldermeade Handicap, Robert
was beaten in the last stride by Jim
Scobie’s representative Petau, but the
ringmen had little reason for elation, as
Petau carried a mint of public and stable
money. The Cranmallan Trial went to
Sindicada, a 20-to-l chance, and fielders
felicitated one another. Sindicada is
prepared by a son of Ike Foulsham, the
veteran Randwick trainer.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Old Q.”: Boxing in Queensland is
likely to benefit by the proposal that the
State Amateur Boxing and Wrestling
Union take control of professional box-
ing and wrestling in the North as well
as the amateur varieties. Maoriland
runs matters in this fashion, and has
made a success of it. There the union
makes all matches for set purses, while
amateurs figure in all the prelims.
Boxers and wrestlers are licensed, and
must produce certificates of fitness be-
fore a bout. Competitors are insured,
premiums coming from a 2 p.c. cut of the
gate; married men on the injured list
get £2 per week and others £1 10s.
Ins and Outs
Victoria, thanks mainly to O’Brien
(173) and Lee (84), made 420 against
N.S.W. in Sydney; but it was dreary
cricket. Only 269 was on the board at
the end of the first day’s play, and the
420 took 474 minutes. Ma’s bowlers,
O’Reilly excepted, were at sea against the
left-handers. Bill got 4 for 85 ; Chil-
vers 3—all towards the finish —for
120. N.S.W. struck trouble early. Fingle-
ton (3) nibbled at offside balls from
Ebeling and went, caught behind, in his
first over, after being dropped earlier,
and Brown (19) did the same thing, Mc-
Cabe had better luck, and later settled
down for a bright 92, The last wicket
fell at 255 (Robinson 57; Fleetwood-
Smith 7 for 113); and Victoria, batting
again, lost 4 for 88.
* * * *
“Shore”: With the exile to Canberra
of the North Sydney trundler Clem Hill,
metropolitan and inter-State cricket loses
a useful left-hander. He has done meri-
torious things for North Sydney in part-
nership with O’Reilly, but has never been
a permanency in the State side. About his
best performance in the Sheffields was
7 for 18 and 5 for 49 against Queens-
land at Sydney in 1932-33, with 91 off
the bat. He had one match with the
State against the Jardinians that year, but
didn’t set the harbor on fire. On his day
Hill is a first-class slow bowler, but his
form and length have been inconsistent
in big cricket.
* * * *
This must be a record or something
near it. T. Roberts, an old boy of Melb.
Scotch College, playing for Tatura (Vic.)
against Mooroopna, got six wickets with
six consecutive balls —the double hat-
trick —five clean-bowled and one l.b.w.
He finished with 8 for 11. .
* * * *
“Lansdowne”: It is rare for a sporting
club to lose a prominent player because
the prison gates have closed on him.
Northampton (seldom far from the
bottom of the county list) has just had
that melancholy experience, its captain,
Jupp, having received nine months for
manslaughter in a car. Jupp, the son
of a famous Sussex player of 50 years
ago, was a professional before the war,
but he took advantage of the M.C.C.’s
ruling that any ex-soldier who had been
a pro. might swing to amateurism. For
years he has been the county’s mainstay,
and he once narrowly missed being
picked for an Australian tour. The
only previous instance I can recall of
a first-class cricketer “going inside” was
that of a chap who got 28 days for some
petty offence. It was in the middle of
the season, too, and provoked the sar-
castic comment that Blank’s latest score
was “28, not out.”
(Continued on next page.)
The Caucasian would appear to be
played out on the water as far as the
sprint events are concerned, judging by
the results at Melbourne swimming car-
nival. Following the triumph of Saka-
gami, Kiyokawa won the 110 yards back-
stroke championship, beating Besomo’s
Australian record by 4sec., while Kwok
Chun Hang carried off the 110 yards
breaststroke championship. His win was
hailed by members of the Young Chinese
Society lighting crackers and sending up
rockets in true Chinese fashion. Over a
distance it was different. Frenchman
Taris had easy wins in all his races. In
the mile he went to the front at the start,
and kept about 10 yards ahead all the
way.
Australians did much better in the
track and field contests ; Sippala was the
only overseas man to succeed on the first
day of the centenary tourney. He won
the shot putt, 42ft. and the javelin
throw, 222 ft. ; Metcalfe was second
with 183 ft. Tin. Metcalfe beat the other
Finn, Perasalo, in the high jump, and
made a new record for Vic., 6ft. sfin.
Victorian Backhouse won the mile, and
N.S.W. sprinter Hampson the hundred.
* * * =H
“Shrewsbury”: This year’s Oxford and
Cambridge boatrace on April 6 will be
extra interesting because of the elaborate
preparations made by both sides. Ox-
ford, determined to break the long
series of Cambridge wins, some months
ago selected three trial eights, which have
been kept at work whenever possible;
Cambridge has followed suit. The Light
Blues have drafted off 19 men to prac-
tise for the final selection. No Austra-
lian figures amongst them, though Marn-
ham, a South African from Stellenbosch
University does —an unusual representa-
tive, for it is a contest in which Afri-
kanders rarely appear.
* * =K *
“Blade”: Four championships will be
contested at the Ma State’s rowing
association regatta on the Nepean on
February 2: the eights, sculls, lightweight
fours and lightweight sculls. Four crews
will tackle the eights event; on recent
form a win for the comparatively juvenile
Haberfield club is indicated, as the quacks
say. Turner, holder of the Australian
and State heavy championships, and
Hoskins, State lightweight champion, will
defend their titles.

Under the Whip
Victoria introduced the tote in August,
1931, and has no regrets. The machine has
been the means of distributing £277,600
among charities, and, although takings
suffered during the abnormal spring, this
year’s surplus is expected to exceed
£130,000. Over the full term the effect
on racecourse attendances and prize-
money has been marked. In these re-
spects, Melbourne has gone right ahead
of Sydney, where the good work of the
tote is undone by excessive taxation (the
Government takes 9 p.c.) and—except at
Randwick —a stupid cleaving to obsolete
forms of machine betting.

According to Westralian accounts,
Cueesun, winner of the last two Perth
Cups, was booked for Melbourne by the
Manunda on Saturday, the owner hav-
ing decided to run him in the Australian
Cup. His name doesn’t appear among
the nominations for that race or for the
Sydney Cup either. Perhaps the stable’s
ambitions soar still higher.
* * * *
At last year’s Australian yearling sales
only five youngsters fetched more than
three figures. For the Windbag—Lutra,
Heroic—Tresseith and Heroic —Shepherd
Princess colts 1100 guineas was paid ;
for the Windbag—Even Song and Heroic
—Cohesion colts, 1000 guineas. Buyers
from Australia went higher for Maori-
land-bred yearlings at Trentham last
week. J. T. Jamieson paid 2100
guineas for a brother to Veilmond by
Limond —Veil, and Moss, who owned
Veilmond, gave 1100 guineas for a
Limond —Aspic colt. L. K. S. Mac-
kinnon wrote a cheque for 1450
guineas for a colt by Night Raid —
Quadrilateral. The bidding for this
youngster was very brisk, and it appears
to have been thought that the buyer-
might be getting another Phar Lap. Con-
sidering the great promise of Homer, the
Iliads sold rather poorly, the best price
realised by the batch being 500 guineas
for an Iliad —Zany colt. A Newcastle
man, H. D. Lucerne, was the successful
bidder. Nearly all the high-priced lots
will come to Australia.
“H.S.”: Rarely do Australian ama-
teur riders turn professionals; though
Jack King did. It is different in England.
A few years ago C. Ancil was carry-
ing everything before him in the cross-
country world on Carfax. Carfax was
owned by Ancil’s brother and trained by
their father, a farmer, and Ancil
wanted to ride him in the Grand
National. He had to turn pro.
The Rees brothers, also farmers, had
the same experience. But rich men,
after riding dozens of winners under
N.H. rules, have remained amateurs —
Gerald Ward, youngest brother of the late
Lord Dudley ; Captain Grosvenor, who
was killed in an aeroplane smash while
A.D.C. to a S. Aus. Governor ; “Roddy”
Owen and many more.
Ins and Outs
“Hotham”: Darling has more than
made up for his disappointing showing
in England by his batting in this year’s
Sheffields. Up to the end of the Queens-
land match in Brisbane the left-hander
had scored three centuries in four
matches, with an average of 113.75 and
an aggregate of 455. His success is the
more gratifying since he is always ready
to go for the bowling, and we need a
batsman of the type. In all Shield
matches his aggregate up to the start of
the match against N.S.W. in Sydney was
2289, and average 52.02. Counting his
32 and 55 n.o. in the Woodfull-Ponsford
testimonial game. Darling was then lead-
ing the Australian batting list with a 542
aggregate and average of 102.40. Darling
once had some pretensions as a bowler,
but these seem to have evaporated.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Vic. cricket heads are
windy over the falling off in Sheffield
Shield takings. Receipts for the games
in Melbourne this year were only £2368
—£l7oo less than for the corresponding
period last year. As the Brisbane-Sydney
tour and the match with South Aus. in
Adelaide will cost £2317, not more than
£5l will be left in this season’s sock. The
association blames broadcasting for the
falling off, but bad weather had a good
deal to do with it. Woodfull and Pons-
ford bagged £1042 each for their benefit
match.
♦ * * *
“Brass-up”: The N.S.W. cricket heads
have loosened their purse-strings and
given Westralia better terms for the visit
of a Ma State side than the original sug-
gestion, which was that it should pay
all expenses and take any profits. Under
the new deal, Ma pays for herself and
then takes the net profits of matches up
to the amount of her expenses, West-
ralia guaranteeing at least £6OO. The
trip will last 22 days, and will cost £9OO.
Ma should run little risk of dropping
the balance if she takes care to send a
gate-drawing team. That will be the
trouble.
* * * *
“Old Cap”; Queensland cricketers
seem a touchy lot nowadays. Levy, the
Queensland captain, was a casualty dur-
ing the match with Victoria in Brisbane,
and did not play. Desiring to see some-
one in the dressing-room, he tried to
enter, but was blocked by the gatekeeper,
and retired in a huff. The papers made
a headline matter of the trumpery hap-
pening, and it was announced that Levy
—an ex-N.S.W. player, by the way—
would shake the accursed dust of Banana-
land off his brogues in retaliation for the
insult. Then the Sydney papers joined
in the argument, until a listening earth
was informed that Mr. Levy had been
placated and had no intention of desert-
ing Queensland.

tour was a success, according to manager
Keane, returned from the Shivery Isles.
Gene was very taken with M.L. and its
courses, and reckons that the amateurs
there are sounder players than the men
on this side, though the result of Win-
deyer Cup meetings with N.S.W. only
as opponents does not make the islanders
out super-golfers. Sarazen also an-
nounced that his ambition was to reside
permanently in M.L. when he retired.
He said the same thing of this country,
and expressed a similar longing for the
delights of Honolulu. By the time he
has done with Japan he will be a pro-
spective citizen of the world.
* * *
“Divot Digger”: Kirkwood postponed
his projected departure for Malaysia and
Japan (B. 16/1/’35), perhaps to tell Aus-
tralian professionals just where they get
off, to speak in Joe’s adopted tongue. He
scoffs at the idea of pros, in this country
playing on handicaps, and says it is the
only country where it is done. Joe
thinks that if a pro. isn’t good enough
to win from scratch he should practise
until he is, instead of cultivating an in-
feriority complex by accepting a handi-
cap. Further, Joseph finds fault with our
golf-course layout. He has pointed out
that there are many accomplished golf
architects in America just now who would
be glad to come over here and show us
just how—for a consideration, of course.
Some of Australia’s leading courses have
been laid out by Dr. Mackenzie, one of
the world’s acknowledged golf archi-
tects, who has plotted more than one
crack American course.

“Marino”: Although the Australian
golf championships for 1936 are to be
played in Adelaide in honor of the S.A.
centenary, the South Australians also
intend to hang on to the fixture for 1935,
which fell to the Wheatfielders in the
regular order of things. Victoria wanted
the date, but was blocked by Ma, who
was determined that if she couldn’t get
it the Yarramen shouldn’t. Nobody
seems to have realised that here was a
chance for Brisbane. As it is, Adelaide
will have two national championships
running.
H* 'i* H*
The sixteenth annual clash of A.I.F.
golfers in the Ma State at Kensington on
February 27 will be decided by par play
on handicaps. Entries must be in by
February 19, addressed to Captain
Walker, the Australian G.C. secretary.
One important change has been the aboli-
tion of the dinner. Of late years the
attendance has fallen off ; many players
have been too tired after the day’s
struggle, and ethers, recalling the
speeches, always a handicap to the suc-
cess of the function, have decided to give
it a miss for that reason.
Racquet and Bawl
“Muck-Up”: The tour of the English
and French tennis-players ended in a
most extraordinary fashion. The last
match of the visitors was scheduled for
Perth. Westralia swears the date fixed
was Monday, January 28; anyway, the
Gropers were staggered when the players
cast up on their way home on Monday.
January 21, having cut their Adelaide fix-
ture short to catch their boat. The
matches, for which elaborate arrange-
ments had been made and seats booked,
had to be cancelled, as the players could
not stay till the 28th.
***!'!
“Rushcutter”: The last of the visiting
tennis-players left for Perth last week,
and will take part in Westralian cham-
pionships and other matches there.
The players are Menzel, Maier, Stefani,
Kirby and Malcolm. With them went
McGrath and Bromwich to give the
meeting an international flavor. Menzel
deserves credit for his farewell message
to the Sydney press, which is stiff won-
dering what he was driving at. Said
the big chap:
I speak too much. When the Austra-
lians go to Prague they say the crowd is
awful, and the locomotives rattle past the
court, and they are right, but some people
do not like the truth.
That is not exactly as clear as mud, but
no one seems to have thought of getting
Kisch, another Czech, to see if he could
make a better fist of translating the mes-
sage than he did of the Gaelic.
* * * *
“Roland”: There is not the slightest
hope that the ban on tennis-players
showing in films for cash will be lifted
(B. 23/1/’35). Already France, America
and Australia have condemned the idea ;
Spain, too. According to one authority,
England is only using Bohemia as a cat’s-
paw.
* * * H:
“Cut Shot”: Kirby, the South African,
now on his way home, ought to be pre-
sented by the barrackers with a medal of
some precious metal. Australian crowds,
he says, are among the best in the world,
and though some of the visitors com-
plained of them the complaint was nor
deserved. Kirby’s only trouble was his
failure to strike his African and Euro-
pean form here; other players in like
fix have been accustomed to curse the
heat, the courts, the climate, the ball-
boys, the babies and everything but
themselves for their failure to live up to
reputation.
Miscellaneous
Tim Banner proved no match for Tolan
at 100 yards on Melbourne’s Exhibition
Oval. The negro beat him by yards in
9-Jsec. Austin Robertson, the South
Melbourne footballer, had as little diffi-
culty in leading McFarlane over 130
yards, doing five yards inside even time.
* * * *
“Stamford Bridge”: The European
athletes for the centenary meeting in
Melbourne at the end of the month,
four Britons and two Finns, arrived in
the pink and are training hard. Ramp-
ling, a gunner subaltern, is the star of
the British team: a big quarter-miler who
holds the Empire championship and
record for the distance. Powell
specialises in the 800 metres;
Craske in distances from a mile
upward on the track and across
country ; Dr. Murdoch is the Scot-
tish 100 and 220 champion. Of
the Finns, Sippala is an ex-world’s
champion in the pentathlon events,
while Perasalo is a
high- and long-
jumper and an ex-
pert hop-stepper.
“T in g 1 e”: The
Finnish members of
the team from
Europe were de-
lighted to find in
Melbourne a compatriot who main-
tains a Finnish bath house. This type of
steam bath, popular in Sweden and
Norway also, is made by throwing water
on heated stone or concrete and
frowsting in the vapor. After this the
patient reclines on a bench and is wal-
loped with birch twigs by a bevy of
girls—in Scandinavia, but not in Mel-
bourne.
* * * *
“Spike”: The Australian A.A.A. is
looking well ahead in the matter of visit-
ing teams from abroad. A batch of
Japanese athletes is to be invited to
tour this country in 1936-37. Queens-
land, N.S.W. and Victoria will be the
hosts, and possibly—in view of its cen-
tenary spree—South Australia.


THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
Thoughts of a Villager
“The Return to Provincialism” and
“Our Real Position” (B. 16/l/’35) are
closely connected; the facts stated by
Mr. Yarwood are in great measure the
cause of the return to provincialism.
In our little country village in Vic-
toria we know only too well that the
civil service is an expensive luxury from
which we derive no benefits commensu-
rate with the enormous cost. We get
our income-tax assessments; we are
charged for our share of Country Roads
Board expenditures; we know we are
paying for a lot of members of Parlia-
ment (State and Federal), mostly use-
less, and we are “inspected” and “regu-
lated” and so on till we believe that we
could not be worse off if there was no
such thing as Federation.
There are not many more apples grow-
ing on a tree, nor more trees to the
acre, since Federation than there were in
pre-Federal days. But more of the apples
have to be used to pay for Federation—
for Parliament and civil service. Some
of the apples have to be used to pay the
drink-bills of members who are too
damn mean to pay their own. And it
is the same with all the other primary
products.
Perhaps these things are not realised
by the city dwellers, but country people
of all political creeds see that they are
paying a lot for very little. That is one
of the causes of the anti-Federal feeling
which undoubtedly exists.
In this little community the chief
industry is apple-growing, but living in
it also are several who, like myself, have
retired from active work. There are
men who have settled here after a life
in business, in law, in the army, in medi-
cine, And we all feel the pinch ; we all
feel that we are being taxed beyond rea-
son or endurance, mainly for the upkeep
of a Parliament which benefits us not,
and a civil service whose influence on
our affairs is merely a blight and a curse.
—Slinga (Vic.).
Lang’s Doing
The Bulletin is right (16/1/’35);
Lang’s 10 per cent, tax on winning
wagers was the slug that nearly settled
horseracing. Here on the northern coal-
fields, where five courses, exclusive of
Newcastle, Maitland and Singleton, used
to cater for the racing public, that tax
was the beginning of the slump. Hun-
dreds of people vowed that they would
not go to another meeting ; 90 per cent,
turned to other sport, mostly the dogs.
Now not one of those courses is function-
ing. Newcastle itself is running at a loss ;
and Wallsend is up for sale. Wallsend used
to give £BOO prize-money for an ordi-
nary day’s meeting. Directly and in-
directly Lang’s tax caused a substantial
loss of tax-revenue ; but s.p. men make
fortunes free of all taxes. — Old Steve

Follow Archibald!
Nothing would have pleased The
Bulletin’s Archibald more than the win-
ning of his portrait prize by a young
relief-worker on one of the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment cement farms. It was just such
men as Hanke whom he hoped to see
win it. He would have loved the impro-
vised studio in a bootmaker’s shop, the
home-made model stand —above all, the
painting itself. European galleries have
many self-portraits which are monuments
to painters whose names are now part
of almost every civilised language.
Albrecht Diirer’s picture of himself,
painted when he was 23 in Nuremberg,
was just such a naive piece of work,
though it was limned in hope rather than
in despair—he was poor, but about to
marry. In many ways the Diirer self-
portrait was no finer than young Hanke’s
work, but it helped to pave the way to
his later greatness. To-day it is a trea-
sured possession of the Louvre.
Australia is richer than any Italian re-
naissance State—its greatest cities are
more than 10 times as big as were
Florence or Venice in their prime. And
if commercial interests were to follow
the lead of the mediaeval merchant
princes and emulate the example of
Archibald, a generation would show this
country’s capacity to stock itself with a
priceless store of art treasures. A lot of
native talent is lost to us because there
are not more Archibalds. —E. H. M'.

Eighty-eight Hours Underground
As I write the Westralian goldminers
have been on strike for weeks rather
than work the 88-hour fortnight in weeks
of 40 and 48 hours. It must be 12 years
since this question was settled amicably
at Mt. Lyell (Tas.). The management
found the Saturday-morning and -after-
noon shifts uneconomic, and asked the
A.W.U. to agree to alternate weeks of
five and six working days. At a union
meeting held at Gormanstown its pro-
posal was turned down. But only eight
unionists were present, and the co. set
out to get a secret ballot. At Nth. Lyell
the g.-m. addressed day and afternoon
shifts outside the candlehouse, promising
that the management would abide by
their decision.
The secret ballot was held, and there
was a 90 p.c. majority for the co.’s pro-
posal. One big reason was the excellent
week-end provided. For instance, after-
noon shift comes off at midnight on
Friday and does not resume till Monday
morning. The average miner is a reason-
able man, and if there had been a
secret ballot on the Golden Mile instead
of a strike the result would have been
the same as at Mt. Lyell.— C. Cure
(Vic.).
Australian-born G.-Gs.
The Bulletin put up a good case for
Australian Governors-General (16/l/’35),
and if we could be assured of a continua-
tion of sound government the case
cannot be faulted. But don’t forget what
happened to the G.-G. in the Irish Free
State. Recollect some of the birds
appointed to the N.S.W. Upper House.
And picture J. S. Garden being pitch-
forked into our highest public position!
Why shouldn’t the King’s sons be
visible links to unite the Empire? Their
inexperience would quickly bring wise,
experienced and impartial councillors. —
J. B. (N.S.W.).
Nordics
Dr. Grenfell Price, of Adelaide, sup-
porting the White Australia policy before
the Science Congress, referred to the
“Nordic people of Australia.” Australia
is not Nordic in origin ; it is doubtful
whether any nation on earth is more than
50 per cent, genuine Nordic, even in-
cluding the Scandinavian nations. The
Germans are certainly not Nordic ; one
of their own ethnologists went into that
subject thoroughly, and pronounced the
Germans to be “over three per cent.
Nordic.”
The English evolved from the Celts
of Ancient Britain, Latins left behind
after the Roman occupation, Germanic
tribes three per cent. Nordic, Danes
who were half-Nordic, and the Normans
—a Nordic tribe which settled in France
and had so intermingled with the resi-
dent population as to have lost its own
language. The amount of Nordic in the
Englishman would be described by an
assayer as “a trace.”
Australia is racially only half-English.
Fully one-fourth of the people from
whom the present-day Australian has
sprung were Irish—south or north. Add
the Scottish element —in the early days
mostly Highland, and, therefore, purely
Celtic —the Welsh and Cornish (both 100
per cent. Celt), and it is not too wide of
the mark to say that Australia is by
descent half-Celt and half-English. The
amount of Nordic in the Australian com-
position is possibly little more than the
amount of Latin.
The Nordic myth is an invention of
certain shrewd Germans, aimed at over-
coming the unpopularity which befell
their race in the years following 1914.
It didn’t work the way it was intended. —

“Kaloa”: At the Melbourne Science
Congress F. E. Williams, a Papuan
anthropologist, is reported to have said
that “it was ill-advised and futile to per-
petuate native culture.” A blend of
native and European culture, he de-
clared, was needed, and he was “in favor
of the maintenance .of British prestige
and missionary enterprise.” Also the
“native feeling of inferiority should be
removed.” The native of interior New
Guinea, to which it was sought to bring
European culture last year by the admis-
sion of gold syndicates and missionaries,
has been demonstrating his sense of
inferiority by polishing a few of the
visitors off. One missionary and a
prospector or two and, of course, a
number of natives are dead.

“Vic”: As a first step to dealing with
pearl poachers the Commonwealth has
amended the pearling ordinance—-
sensibly, it has done it quietly. Hence-
forward ship licenses will be granted
only to British-born persons or to
companies two-thirds British. The
Minister secures control of the quantity
which any pearlsheller may gather
during the period of his license. Powers
of seizure are taken, and also of forfeit-
ure in certain circumstances. Licens-
ing is compulsory under penalty of £5OO.
Pearl-cleaners, also, must have licenses,
keep books and require from persons
bringing pearls to be cleaned a proper
identification. It is a sound bit of pearl-
ing law, particularly as penalties, which
formerly applied only to owners of
vessels, are now applied also to masters.
With a decent patrol it should stop a lot
of poaching.
* * * *
“Kwakprak”: A middle-aged Brisbane
spinster took her pet Airedale to a vet.
and arranged for the animal’s painless
destruction on the following day at 6 p.m.
precisely. In reply to suggestions that
she might sell or give away so fine a
dog she replied that she was going
somewhere where she could not take it,
and was not coming back. The Airedale
was killed painlessly as arranged. At
6.30 its mistress was found dead, with
her head in a gas-oven. She took an
easy way, but less methodical people have
often undergone unnecessary agony and
delay in shedding a life which has become
a burden to them. Lysol, strychnine, rat-
poison are horrors to die of. Why
shouldn’t there be some approved, effi-
cient, merciful way out? Even if birth-
control is barred, something might be
done for death-control.
“A.J.”: Crossed the Big Divide last
week, Richard Arthur Letts, a youngster
of 83. He lived at Indooroopilly (Q.)
during the last few years of his life, but
when he came to Queensland well over
half a century ago it was to the North
that he turned. Teamster, sawmiller and
grazier, he had a host of friends scattered
from Townsville to Boulia, Normanton
to Cloncurry. A staunch supporter of
The Bulletin since its earliest days, one
of his last wishes was that mention of
his passing should be made in the paper
he loved. Arthur Letts, of Los Angeles,
is a brother.

“Northern”: Wave Hill is the largest
one-man police patrol in Australia.
V. C. Hall controls it. The Alice Springs
patrol beats Wave Hill by about 50
miles; but it is under the care of a ser-
geant (Lovegrove) and two police con-
stables (McKinnon and Deviney). Inside
three months Constable Hall covered
almost 1500 miles by horse and car. The
Wave Hill and Alice Springs patrols
meet at Tanami.

“G. Trotter”; The presentation of
mementoes of Governor Brisbane’s
family to Brisbane Museum reminds
me of a talk I had with Arthur
Brisbane, editor-in-chief of all the
Hearst publications, when I was in
New York six years ago. He assured
me that he felt a peculiar interest
in Australia from the fact that he was
related to “one of the Governors of the
early days.” I asked him why he didn’t
visit this country, and he replied that
when he could fly here he would —so we
may yet see him some day.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Our vice-regals had a nasty time in a
gale before the Marella tottered into
Darwin, almost two days overdue. A
wave nearly washed the Governor over-
board.
Mrs. Percy Cowlishaw is tripping over
to San Francisco with niece Charlotte
Capper. Mrs. Bob Stodart (once Del
Abercrombie) will be another February
tourist, leaving about the end of next
month for Java, Japan and China.
Audrey Mackay, who married C. J.
Jorss, went two days before the cere-
mony to a pre-wedding tea staged by her
two bridesmaids, Thyra Nimmo and Joy
Griffiths.
Mr. and Mrs. P. Percy —she was a
Spowers, of Corinda —are over from
Upper Assam on leave. The Percys are
tea-planting, somewhere near the North-
West Frontier. Their little daughters
Judith and Jocelyn, aged nine and eight,
are more fluent in Hindustani than they
are in English.
These moonlight nights are so lovely
and there always is such a cool breeze on
the river that river parties are leaping
into favor. The Chris Dahls started the
fashion when they gave a party on the
Miramar in honor of son’s 21st birth-
day. There were dancing on the decks
and birthday favors for each guest.
Then the D. F. Longlands packed the
Apache with country friends for a trip
to Wreck Island.
Winifred Savage, who came out at the
United Service Ball in Show Week, is
busy packing. Her parents, the W. E.
Savages, are taking her on a trip to the
Old Country.
A nice Dutch girl from Java is Miss
Koolnees, who is over to visit a brother
at Maleny. The lass has lived in Java for
12 years, and for five of them has been
nursing at a hospital near Batavia. The
tropics have no terrors for her, but per-
haps that is because Dutch women in
Java are so sensible about their clothes.
As a delicate compliment to Alison
Stuart, down from Ambo (C.Q.) on a
holiday, an ice-cream sheep decked the
table when Ken Barber gave a dinner
in her honor at his parents’ home at
Clayfield. Several recent debs, and an-
other Longreach girl, Margaret Watts,
were there.
Esme and Marjorie Quinn will stage
a double wedding on February 6 with
Kevin Ward and John McCoy. One
bride is to be clad in pale blue and the
other in pink, and each will have four
bridesmaids, dressed in matching colors.
Over 150 guests rolled up to the garden
party staged at Bulimba House, the home
of Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Moore, in honor
of the 80th birthday of Mr. F, C. Lea,
better known (to the Diggers, at all
events) as “Dad.” There is hardly a
charity in Brisbane for which he has not
worked, but his years of association with
the Soldiers’ Fathers’ organisation has
most endeared him to Diggers. He re-
ceived various oddments in crystal, a
silky-oak serving tray, a case of pipes, a
tobacco-jar filled with his pet mixture
and an illuminated address ; in the morn-
ing a loughboy of Queensland silky oak.
Tom Welsby, a close friend since 1882,
made a little speech.
Mrs. J. S. Hutcheon is off to England
by the Moldavia on February 13. Son
Dr. J. R. Hutcheon, over here for a holi-
day after getting his degree at London
University, is returning to England as
ship’s doctor on the Ballarat, and Mrs.
Hutcheon expects to arrive almost as
soon as he does.
Marjorie Mant, who already has
started on her English trip, was fare-
welled almost to the eleventh hour. Mrs.
J. E. Trude and daughter Everill were
among the final hostesses.
Sheila Watson, of Oak Park, Yarran-
lea, and only daughter of the late Mr.
and Mrs. G. N. Watson, of Pittsworth,
has a new diamond ring. The young
man is Sam Cowlishaw, of Garry-Hun-
don, Darling Downs. He is the second
son of the late J. P. O. Cowlishaw and
of Mrs. Cowlishaw, of Clayfield, and is
a grandson of the late James Cowlishaw,
who, with his brother George, at one
time controlled the destinies of the “Tele-
graph,” Brisbane.
Now that the young girls, both half-
caste and abo., at Dunwich and Myora
have adopted the slacks, shirt and beret
for beach wear Miss Australia, descen-
dant of the usurping race, may go all
womanly again. Down the bay the
other day two dusky Venuses wore dark-
blue slacks and shirts. Their slim
bodies looked better in the rational garb
than do 90 p.c. of their white sisters, who
carry more weight round the hips.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The A.J.C. continues to embroider its
lawns with its initials, just as though
they were hankies that some passionate
souvenirer might get off with. For the
Anniversary meeting the tonings were
autumnal yellow and red. Near by were
beds of pink petunias. The palms seemed
to enjoy their trunks being embraced by
flowering shrubs, and over all growing
things was an air of gay exuberance. The
same cannot be said for the dressing,
which was of the holiday-meeting order.
Patterned silk was the favorite fabric ;
navy the most-repeated shade.
Fred McMaster’s lady wore this color,
but brightened it with a vest in red, white
and blue. Sue Other Gee was an attrac-
tive girl who wore her gay scarf knotted
and falling down the back of her dark
frock. The smartest present was Mrs.
Hans Fay, in a slim suit of white pat-
terned in brown ; her brown hat, though
brimmed, had the same tailored look.
Mrs. Jimmy Burns went handsomely clad.
Her frock was magnolia in tone, and
was covered by a navy coat. A blue and
a wine-colored chrysanthemum finished
off the frilled collar of Mrs. Douglas
Duff’s black-and-white neatness. Tall
Joan Marks wore brown linen.
As this page was getting into its pink
slacks the Harbor was massed with craft
of all shapes and sizes. The Ormonde,
lying off Neutral Bay, was the flagship,
and was all dressed up with bunting and
humans. On the swelling waves around
her, motor-boats, rowing-boats and
yachts were bobbing about, taking part
in Port Jackson’s 99th regatta. This is
claimed to be the oldest surviving aquatic
carnival in the world, and it says much
for the imagination of the pioneers that
they thought of thus celebrating the an-
niversary of their Pacific-washed land.
For those who like figures, it is estimated
that there were nearly 2000 men and
boys manning the competing dinghies
and yachts and whalers.
What a pity Belgium’s Consul Segaert
did not plant an orange grove when he
arrived in Sydney. There seems to be
a regular run on orange-blossom in the
family. Paul Gerard, the youngest son,
has become engaged to May, youngest
daughter of Mrs. M. A. Proud, of Mos-
man, and the late T. J. Proud.
Our new Governor, Alexander Hore-
Ruthven, has given his patronage to a
championship dog show to be held at
Canterbury Park on February 23 in aid
of the funds of Furlough House. This
is the pleasant holiday home at Narra-
been for the mothers, widows, wives and
children of ex-servicemen. It opened its
doors in 1919, and since then between
8000 and 9000 guests have enjoyed its
hospitality. Eight families at a time can
nest under the friendly roof. The living
quarters are laid out in flats, and each
family has a private bedroom, sleeping-
out verandah and bathroom (with hot
service). The children have their meals
on one large verandah ; the mothers dine
together in the communal dining-room.
No worry, freedom from responsibility of
housekeeping, the fresh breeze, the
stretching beach! The mothers enjoy
their holiday as much as the youngsters.
If you don’t feel like the dog show, you
can send a subscription direct.
Even being the wife of the Federal
Minister for Health does not deter one’s
appendix from becoming fractious. Poor
Dame Mary Hughes was hurried to the
Mater Misericordiae Hospital last week
suffering from acute appendicitis. Her
friends, and they are legion, are delighted
to learn from latest reports that she is
progressing favorably.
There was joy in both the Men’s and
the Women’s Pioneer Clubs last Friday.
The members were busy honoring the
memory of the first Governor of New
South Wales. If Captain Arthur Phillip
could have looked into the nicely-
appointed clubhouses that have sprung
up on what in his time was a stretch of
virgin bush, he’d probably have been
vastly gratified. But among the minia-
tures and reproductions of family
portraits on the walls would he have
recognised any old Sydney friends?
The Men Pioneers had a lunch;
the Women fluttered into an afternoon
party. The Macquarie-street stronghold
of the latter was gay with flowers and
heady with song. President Mrs. W. A.
Lingham and secretary Carlotta Doyle
hostessed, and among the guests were
the Kelso Kings (he’s president of the
Men Pioneers), Mrs. John Waugh, Jeannie
Ranken, Suttors, Blaxlands and hosts of
suchlike well-known names.
The clear-cut profile in this Freeman
photograph is owned by an enthusiastic
young worker for Legacy. Till last week
she was Enid Fairfax, the very capable
secretary of the younger group. A few
days ago she became confirmed in the
Legacy faith, as it were, by marrying
woolbuyer Jerrold Joske —one of the
Fiji Joske clan, and a foundation Legacy
Clubman.
Girl Guides and Boy Scouts got a thrill
during the week-end when the Chief
Scout and Lady Baden-Powell called on
Sydney. With them came daughters
Heather and Betty. The week-end was
spent quietly as the guests of the Robert
Dixsons at Castle Hill.
The Fellowship of Australian Writers
snared Jonathan Cape, of the English
publishing firm, as their lunch guest last
Friday. The David Jones restaurant was
a scene of brisk animation by one
o’clock, and all along the tables mari-
golds nodded in the vibration caused by
the knife-and-fork drill. The publisher
is a tall, fresh-faced man who looks as
though he hunts foxes rather than poets.
President Tom Inglis Moore made the
ideal speech of introduction, witty, brief
and devoid of “Ts.” Then Jonathan rose,
and whether secretly you might have
thought he did protest too much about
the lack of charm the best-seller has for
the up-to-date publisher or middleman,
you recognised that he represented a nice
problem of geographical adjustment to
the assemblage. To Margaret Gilruth
(her blue hat was the shade of corn-
flowers) and to Consul for Netherlands
Staal, whose writings his firm handles,
Jonathan represented Newfoundland,
while to the unpublished author he was
the Cape of Good Hope. Beatrice Grim-
shaw, a new member of the Fellowship,
was a luncher ; so were Ida Leeson and
Lute Drummond. Secretary Frank Clune
and treasurer Arthur Crocker snatched a
bite on the wing, Maorilander Bartlett
Adamson and novelist Frank Davison
hobnobbed, and there was a great con-
course of girl and boy writers.
English airwoman Mrs. Duff and her
mother, Mrs. Peyton, are enjoying a
visit to Sydney, and declare that clothes,
are smarter and cheaper here than in
London.
There are 200 or so businessmen of
Sydney who look upon Diggers’ children,
especially orphans, as their legacy from
the war. Some years ago they banded
themselves together under the title of
the Legacy Club (there are brother
groups in all the States) and set
about bettering the lot of their young
legatees. Unlike most clubs, they did
not begin by setting up a nice home-
from-home for themselves in which to
hatch their good deeds. They are still
without a permanent roof (they meet for
discussion and lunch at a city hotel),
though they have just secured comfort-
able and well-equipped quarters for their
charges. These occupy the whole of the
top floor of Nock and Kirby’s in George-
street North, what used to be the dining-
room being now an up-to-date gym-
nasium.
Up there, besides evenings devoted to
physical well-being (the boys and girls
use the gym. on alternate nights) and to
dancing and community singing enjoyed
by all the legatees, there’s an office whose
activities are directed to finding employ-
ment for the youngsters. Every year
jobs are found for 250 to 275 beginning
citizens. Here, too, is a library, its
shelves always calling aloud for more
books ; for they are voracious readers,
these legatees, and quickly consume the
mental fuel within their reach. Next
month, for the first time in its history, the
Legacy Club is making a public appeal
for funds. It is staging a ball at the
Town Hall to help with the new club-
rooms. The State’s new Governor, Sir
Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who joined the
club while vice-reigning in Adelaide, will
make his debut to social Sydney at this
function.
Here’s a young airwoman with an
appropriate name. She is Nancy Bird,
and her specialty is blind- and night-
flying. She has the distinction of being
the first girl in N.S.W. to fly solo at night.
Miss Bird obtained her A license when
she was 17, thereby becoming Australia’s
youngest aviatrix. She has passed her
advanced course and her technical ex-
aminations. Last Thursday the Manly
girl went through her general flying test,
and the results of this are yet to come up
from Melbourne. If successful she will
be able to tuck her B license inside the
tunic of one of the youngest commercial
airwomen in the British Empire. The
flighty one is just 19, and that is the
lowest age at which a commercial license
is issued. FaJk made the photo.
Last week threaded a tartan riband
in her hair and became almost as adept
at Gaelic as the police force. It was
all in honor of Bur-rns. Brawny Scots*
and sonsie lassies rushed up to the
fourth floor of the Assembly Hall.
Haggis also came to this party, in all its
awful mystery, its dignity upheld by a
full bodyguard of bagpipes. In the
Assembly Hall, too, the Highland Society
forgathered for a braw, bricht moonlicht
nicht, and had what it rightly termed
a social gathering. All the “dos” were
set with the bright jewel of the songs of
Scotland’s poet. But this Letter enjoyed
most of all the afternoon celebration
around the statue of the ploughman bard
in the Domain.
While the Bannockburn-and-heather
feeling persists, mention might be made
of one of the Highland Society’s less
known treasures. It is a book of the
tartans of the old Scottish chiefs. These
are handwoven, and display even in
plaids of the same clan a distinct differ-
ence in coloring according to the social
usage of the plaidie—the hunting tartan
is sombre in hue, the evening tartan much
brighter. The notes by Donald William
Stewart are printed on Whatman’s royal
handmade paper—the book is one of 50
copies, and was one of the prized posses-
sions of the late Dr. Jarvie Hood. Miss
Jarvie Hood gave it to F. M. Dempster,
who, wanting his brother-Scots to enjoy
it, handed it on to the society,
Mrs. Harry Burrell, who has just dis-
posed of her second station property in
the Manilla district, has again taken up
housekeeping in Sydney. With her
famous husband, known in scientific
circles as the “platypus man,” she is in-
stalled in a charming home in Cook-road,
which borders Centennial Park. As well
as modern furnishings she has many old
family possessions. The new home is
Spanish bungalowish—all flower-baskets,
cream and green paint, porches and
plate-glass windows.
A New Year honor has come to Sister
Parry, of the St. John Ambulance
Society. For 15 years the energetic lady
has been organising secretary for the
association, and now she has been titled
Lady Commander of the Order of St.
John. When Sister Parry first took over
her job, the Sydney premises consisted of
one small room, the staff of one office-
boy. Now the activities of the society
require a lecture hall and a suite of
offices in the Assembly Hall. From
about 60 first-aid classes a year the
numbers have mounted to between 200
and 300.
Jonathan Cape missed the other day
a gathering he would have enjoyed, ft
was arranged by John Lane Mullins, and
filled his flat in Greenknowe-avenue with
the literary and the artistic. Sydney Ure
Smith popped in for half an hour.
Gruner was there, being congratulated
on gaining the Wynne prize for a land-
scape owned by Eadith Walker and ad-
mired by Prince Henry. Another guest,
Mrs. Webb (she was an Austin), claims
a poet laureate among her ancestors.
Japan’s Consular Murais were at home
to vast numbers of Sydneyites last
Thursday. They chose the decks of the
Atsuta Mam for their reception, and the
hostess was a delightful figure in her
national dress, the coloring of which was
in tones of burgundy and wistaria. Flags
fluttered, and brightly-colored lanterns
gleamed around the dancing-space. There
was a cinema, the main features of which
were scenes of Japanese life ; there was
a sugar replica of a monastery in the
saloon; there was cherry-blossom, and
there were daintily-painted souvenir pro-
grammes. Archbishop Mowll and his
wife were among the guests. Sir Hugh
Poynter and his lady danced a measure.
Mrs. E. Wunderlich was notable in
Madonna-blue lace.

Chatter
The Frankston regatta wound up with
the Davey’s Bay Yacht Club dance at
the The Fernery. Parties varying in size
from twosomes to a score or so distri-
buted themselves round the room at
cabaret tables, late-comers balancing their
sandwiches on the verandah or resting
their elbows on the drink counter. Com-
modore A. Peck was present; also sec.
Hugh Peck and his wife. Occasionally
Jimmy Paxton and John Grimwade gave
the drummer a spell, and thumped out
rhythm for the orchestra, while Lynette
Walker, in a misty-blue frock, tried her
hand and her ear at the cymbals. Mrs.
Jimmy Dodd wore heavy white crepe
cut to a sculptured line. Mrs. Jervis Car-
negie’s gown was sprayed with red and
white leaves. Joan Bennett whisked a
hankie of the same shade as the claret-
colored velvet bows knotted upon the
shoulders of her dusty-pink frock. Mrs.
Pat Cahill was in blue taffetas, and Mrs.
Edward Bilson wrapped herself in an
arabesque robe. Black and white stripes
ran down one side, while green and red
gyrated upon the other, where there was
a split to the knee. Mrs. W. Hargrave
buckled a shiny leather belt round her
organza dress, patterned with black and
white triangles. Marea Lucas decorated
her ears with long dangling ornaments.
Among others present were Mr. and
Mrs. A. J. Phillips, who have built a
home near Frankston, and a couple of
the Wally Moore girls, very sunburned
and wearing strapped sandals on their
bare toes.
Mrs. J, G. Latham decided that per-
fect weather is much too precious to
miss, and held her late-afternoon party
out of doors. At Flete, the long, low
bungalow which is the Lathams’ Malvern
home, are expansive lawns, woody shrub-
beries, an orchard and a little Japanese
idol in a bed of dahlias. The verandahs,
which were the headquarters of cock-
tails and savories, are long and wide.
The party was given in honor of Sir
Nevile and Lady Beatrix Wilkinson, who
received the guests in the hall with Mr.
and Mrs. Latham. Lady Beatrix was in
blue figured georgette, with a hat of a
deeper blue. The hostess tucked a bunch
of gardenias into the waist of her trained
black moire skirt, which fitted snugly
over a blouse of brocaded beige crepe
de Chine. Daughter Freda wore flower-
strewn marocain and balanced a large
white hat upon her auburn locks. Many
of the guests were people interested in
the Children’s Hospital and the Ortho-
paedic branch at Frankston, which, with
Yoralla, will benefit considerably from
the exhibitions of Titania’s Palace.
The Earl of Wicklow was present.
Professor Laby was noticed in deep and
doubtless scientific conversation with
Engineer-Commander Cresswell. Mrs.
Cresswell wore a merging of blue and
white and a navy hat. Mrs. Wallace
Mitchell swung a three-quarter length
of navy coat over her floral gown. Scotch
College’s nevy principal brought Mrs.
Gilray, clad in burgundy. Colonel and
Mrs. Cosgrave, Mrs. Edmund Collins,
Mrs. Joseph Levi, in a lacy coat and a
fluffy feather boa, and Mrs. G. J. Coles,
a silver thread mingling with the deep-
blue of the heavy silk material of her
dress, were noticed treading the lawns.
The Gullett lady pierced her black tulle
cocktail hat with a diamond pin ; her
dress of plain crepe broke into volumin-
ous Magyar sleeves in a figured pattern,
Margaret Campbell, in a navy coat with
cape sleeves and buttons running races
down the sides, accompanied her fiance,
J. R. Darling. Mrs. Thomas Baker was in
dove-grey satin, and Mrs. Kent Hughes
chose ink-blue. Pat Chomley, in blue-
and-white-flecked matelasse under a light-
weight blue coat, and Mrs. J. G.Whitaker,
of the sleek, dark head who wore flow-
ered chiffon to the toes of her green
sandals, were among those who sauntered
in the vicinity of the fishpond. There
golden fantails, little black-and-orange
goggle-eyes and Japanese rarities with
blue heads and black bodies swim in
safety, for netting over the surface of the
pond protects them from hungry kooka-
burras.
Sir Nevile and Lady Beatrix Wilkinson
with their daughter left Melbourne dur-
ing the week-end. They will visit M.L.
and have a quick look at Brisbane before
embarking for England in the middle of
February. Titania’s Palace will remain
in Australia for several months.
Caught in a serious mood by a
Broothorn camera is Jean, only child of
Mr. and Mrs. H. P, Ogilvie, of Canter-
bury. Miss Ogilvie has lately been sub-
merged in waves of fluffy taffeta, con-
fetti and parties, for she was chief brides-
maid at the wedding of Shirley Dale and
John Moore. She is an old girl of Fin-
tona, and took a B.Com. degree in Mel-
bourne. She hopes to go abroad one
day, but so far “See Australia First” has
been her policy. She takes a holiday
every year, and has visited all the States
of the Commonwealth.
In honor of the Mawson lady and
other visitors to the Science Congress,
Mrs. Hylton Dale gave a party at the
Quamby Club. Guests were received in
the large drawing-room. Thence there
was a drift to the private dining-room,
where one long table decoratively laden
was placed diagonally across the room.
The hostess wore a cream lace gown
with a black taffeta coat and two white
camellias, one on her lapel, the other
pressed upon the brim of her wide black
hat. The guest of honor, in black-and-
white-patterned chiffon, a diaphanous
multicolored scarf swathed across her
shoulders, carried a presentation sheaf of
mixed flowers. Prof. Dakin’s wife was
a-rustle with taffeta. Her navy coat, a
combination of elegance and utility, had
a knotted scarf fastened around the
neck; her hat was also of navy taffeta
Mrs. Charles Fenner wore black-and-
green-figured crepe. Mrs. Woolnough
topped her ninon with black millinery.
Mrs. Copeland was in green, and the
Raws lady had triangles of lace inserted
into the shoulders of her figured frock.
The mignonette-and-whife ninon gown
worn by Mrs. G. L. Chilvers went beau-
tifully with her white hair. Among Can-
berra visitors were Mrs. Angel and Mrs.
Hogg. Nell Woods, of Adelaide, wore
swamp-green and a large expanse of hat-
brim. Mrs. L. C. King, of M.L., who
is on her way to Cape Town, was in
shell-pink, with a large white hat. Mrs.
A. B. Walkom, wife of the hon. general
sec. for the Science Congress, was clad
in deep burgundy. Mrs. Lucius, Con-
olly wore brightly-figured silk, and
around the neck was a fluffy collar of
rough-edged stiffened petals.
The official programme of the Science
Congress was brought to a close by the
hospitality committee’s informal tea in
the Botanical Gardens, There was a
band—an enormous success with the
nursemaids and children spending the
afternoon in the vicinity of the lake. The
youngsters edged closer and closer; they
can watch the baby ducks and cygnets
every afternoon, but it is not often they
get the chance of meeting a trombone
face to face. Canvas chairs were strewn
on the lawns, and tables were spread on
the verandah of the tea-house and in the
dappled shade of tall trees near by, beach
umbrellas helping to provide protection
from the sun. The Masson lady did
the honors in black, with flattened roses
on the crown of her small hat. The
Mawson lady, in a black georgette coat
over a pastel gown, was accompanied
by her mother, Mrs. Delprat, and by her
daughters. The lasses are so alike in
build and coloring that Prof. Skeats, who
is godfather to one of them, is not
always able to distinguish Patricia and
Jessica. Prof, and Mrs. Summers were
in the gathering, she wearing an en-
semble of navy silk tweed. Mrs. Fred
Singleton chose the blue of delphiniums.
Miss Ironside (M.L.) was also in blue,
and Miss Brock (Sydney) was particu-
larly smart in brown. Vivacious Mrs.
Watson Robertson, wearing a stiffened
navy eye-veil upon a white hat, pro-
duced a brown-paper bag, gathered up
cake from the tea-table and went off to
pay a call upon the baby swans.
Mrs. E. R. Pitt, in chiffon patterned
with grey and black, was among the
wearers of committee rosettes. Dr. and
Mrs. Billing were among the guests, she
in a floral satin frock with an intricate
ornamentation of interlaced pipings,
and gloves with gauntlets of stiffened
gauze. Dr. Billing is an economist on
his way to Dunedin after two years’
study in London. Dr. Desmond Herbert
(Q.) and his wife were there, Mrs. Her-
bert wearing a sailor hat with an Air
Force blue suit. Prof. Ewart’s wife had
a fluttering cape upon her brown chiffon
garment.
Here is Mrs. J. Pearson, whose flair
for clothes made her a very attractive
figure at Science Congress functions.
Dr. and Mrs. Pearson have lived seven
months in Tasmania, which they find
very cold and shivery after the moist
tropic climate of Ceylon. Dr. Pearson
is Director of the Museum in Hobart,
and for many years held a similar posi-
tion in Colombo. He’s an Englishman,
and his wife hails from M.L. Broothorn
made the portrait.
One of the lectures of the Science Con-
gress was delivered by an attractive
young woman in a white linen suit with
a jumper and hat of navy-blue spotted
with white. She was Joyce Allan, and the
subject of her paper was “The Economics
of the Marine Shells of Australia and
New Zealand.” No wonder an oyster is
an expensive luxury! Miss Allan ex-
plained that it has many enemies—a
sudden influx of fresh water, thousands
of borers, crabs and mudworms are some
of them. Oysters can be eaten any time
—the months with “r’s” in them are all a
myth. But there are other mollusca
which we ought to use as food. Some
may be tough, but we chew tough steak!
The scallop is of higher food value than
the oyster ; the toheroa, which the blacks
and shipwrecked mariners have lived
upon, could be put to other uses than
those of soup. If experiments were
made in cooking many shellfish could
be made more palatable than they look
when seen (and smelt) as bait. The iri-
descent shells of Tasmania, which many
years ago enjoyed a vogue as necklaces,
would grow into an industry if fashion
designers would look favorably upon
their decorative qualities.
For her marriage with George Alsop
in St. John’s, Toorak, Linda Skewes
chose a wedding garment of dull-surfaced
suede crepe upon which was woven a
brocaded design of silver leaves. Her
tulle veil was held in position by a chaplet
of orange-buds which was worn by
another demure bride 100 years ago.
Sole attendant Madge Calder performed
her duties in a gown of sky-blue moire,
bustled and trained, with epaulette sleeves
and a flared panel introduced into the
front of the slim skirt. Her hair was
wreathed with delphinium petals, and she
carried delphiniums and gladioli. The
’groom, who is the elder son of Dr. and
Mrs. C. J. Alsop, of Warrenbayne,
Bairnsdale, chose Geoff Docker as his
best man. Afterwards W. J. Skewes,
assisted by his daughter-in-law, Mrs.
George Skewes, entertained at Grosvenor.
Mrs. Blamire Young, widowed, will
again turn her skilful hand to woodcarv-
ing at her home at Montrose. It is some
years since she practised her art, but
friends who visited her beautiful old
country home will remember the carved
door in the lounge. She still has in her
possession the elaborately-carved black-
wood panels which hang over the mantel-
piece. Mrs. Young was a sturdy help-
mate to her husband in his work. Blamire
Young had a keen eye for old furniture,
and has left a fine collection of china at
Montrose. Mrs. Young will probably
hold an exhibition of his paintings.
Mrs. Carlyle Smythe has returned from
Japan, where she went as a delegate to
the world-wide Red Cross Conference.
She found her Japanese very useful (she
studied the language with a tutor for
several months before she left Mel-
bourne). The folk of Nippon were tre-
mendously thrilled at meeting a foreigner
willing to tackle their difficult tongue.
Mrs. Smythe has brought back the First,
Second and Third Infant Readers, com-
plete with quaint pictures of boys and
girls, crabs, monkeys and other animals
all dressed in kimonos and playing about
together. It is said by the frivolous that
people are apt to go nutty through the
study of Oriental languages, but Mrs.
Smythe is a well-balanced person with a
sense of humor —she’s perfectly safe. Lan-
guages come easily to her. She found
German a considerable help at the Red
Cross Conference.
Miss D. Merritt, with her niece Peggy
Campbell, is off for Java and Singapore.
A bon voyage cocktail was mixed for
Peggy by her sisters Barbara and Judith.

SHOWS
Blamire
Young
Many of
Blamire Young’s
fellow - artists
criticised his art
because he had
failed to master
the elements of drawing. But more
factors than drawing make for the pro-
duction of good art, among them imag-
ination, which he possessed to the nth
degree, whereas many excellent drafts-
men are merely photographic machines
who leave their accuracies destitute of life.
Blamire excelled in water-colors of
fantasies and landscapes and architec-
tural subjects. The landscapes were his
own. Nature did little more than give
him a hint. Architecture similarly was
just a suggestion for the dream palace
of color which he would erect on paper.
It has been told that on one occasion he
upset a small bowl of purple wash over
a sheet he had prepared to work upon.
He studied it for a few seconds ; then
set to work on it, turning to advantage
every trickle of the color and evolving
a landscape which to-day hangs on the
wall of some proud owner.
Blamire Young was always one of
Australia’s most successful artists. He
was able to sell his water-colors even in
the depths of the several depressions he
went through. And his fame is not con-
fined to his adopted country. He spent
the war years in England, and remained
some time later. At the Royal Academy
exhibition of 1920, his “Burghers of
Calais” came close to being the most
talked-of picture of the year. There
was imagination—-Young’s imagination—
in that picture. Rodin’s group “The
Burghers of Calais” stands in front of
the House of Lords in Westminster. The
setting sun threw its shadows on the wall
of the building, and Young painted his
picture revealing the shades of the
burghers as eager, hungry, rebellious men
about to break their way into the very
citadel of privilege.
When I first met Young he was doing
posters for the Dunlop Tyre Company
in Melbourne ; his work began a new
era in Australian poster design. From
The time he set the fashion, gone were
the old-time lithograph atrocities which
used to disfigure every hoarding in the
Commonwealth. He worked the poster
tradition into his serious efforts; his
John Buckley, his Fawkner’s Printing
Press and his exquisite little scene in a
garden showing the pumpkin patch in
the foreground— possibly the best thing
he ever did— all suggest the poster with-
out a trace of its flamboyance.
Blamire had his ups and downs finan-
cially. He would have declined to believe
that a bookmaker could turn out a
water-color drawing, but he firmly be-
lieved that he knew more of the form
of horses than any bookmaker born.
The result was that his successful sales
often meant fur coats for bookmakers’
wives. He used to tell a tale of how
once his belongings were seized for rent,
those belongings including a finished
water-color which was sold at a tenth
of its value, to hang, finally on the walls
of Adelaide’s gallery. Blamire discov-
ered this only when he visited the gallery,
and, in an extremely courteous note to
the trustees, suggested that, as they
thought well enough of one of his pictures
to buy it at a tenth of its value, they
might care to purchase another at fair
market price. The trustees were sports.
They took Blamire at his word, and to-
day two of his water-colors adorn the
walls.
Though he had spent the greater part
of his life in Australia, he remained Old
English to the fingertips. He walked,
dressed and talked like a man just off
the mail boat. But he was no snob.
An example from the fine harvest of Lionel Lindsay’s latest trip abroad,
exhibited at the Macquarie, Sydney.
though people who failed to discern the
tongue he often put in his cheek might
think otherwise by a remark he once
made. He was discussing the aims of
the Melbourne University, and asked
whether it wished to be a university or
“just a place where one learnt things.”
His Australian companion, unversed in
British ways, asked what the difference
was. “Well,” explained Blamire, who
was a Cambridge graduate himself, “in
England if a man wants to learn things
he goes to London University or one of
those places. But he goes to Oxford to
be an Oxford man. There he acquires
something which you may call side, but
of which he is very proud and which
never leaves him through life. He may
become a butchah or a burglah or a blud-
gah, but he remains an Oxford man.”
Seventy-two when he died, and the
same old Blamire when I last spoke to
him a month or two ago as when I first
met him in the middle ’nineties pedalling
his bike down Collins-street.

Hour of Cleanness.
After the dragging hours the red eyes
Take cool delight in the hollow globe of
steel
Tilting towards the east, the chimneys,
the houses
Squatting in horror and silence.
For I am clean
From the grimy film imposed by nightly
anguish,
Oh, immeasurably clean and free from
these the houses
Squatting in horror and silence
Where men groan under
The clammy fungoid filthiness of sleep
That on their souls, their bright aware-
ness feasts
And slimily fattens, and leaves them less
than beasts.
After the dragging hours the red eyes
Take cool delight in the black trees set
in steel,
In the new wind that suddenly brushes
Back from the boughs, and gushes
A flood of lilies, clarity and
The silver cataract of a thousand
thrushes.

DOUGLAS A. STEWART.
Justice for
Berlioz
The gods of
Hector Ber lioz
were Shakspeare,
Goethe, V i r g i 1,
Gluck and Beet-
hoven. He was
credited, even in his own time, with hav-
ing a profounder mastery of orchestration
than any other composer. He wrote volu-
minously on music, though for the
greater part with the utmost distaste for
the task, and his criticisms are logical,
skilfully analytical and just. His judg-
ments have stood the test of 60 years.
His scores (the matter may seem trivial,
but isn’t) were penned with a meticulous
neatness and with a wealth of detailed
direction as to expression and perform-
ance unequalled by any other great
composer. Liszt and Schumann hailed
him as a genius. Yet all that remains
of hirn for the wider circle of musicians
in this year 1934 is a vague tradition that
his “Symphonic Fantastique” (hardly ever
performed even in Europe) is a remark-
able work, and a knowledge that he
wrote a “Faust” opera, gleaned from the
fact that a gramophone record has been
made of one of the numbers in it. It
has long been the habit of commentators
to dismiss the claims of Berlioz to great-
ness on two grounds— (a) that he took
up music late in life and lacked training,
being unable even to play the piano-
forte ; (b) that his work is uncouth, fan-
tastic and too utterly romantic.
An Australian-born writer, W. I.
Turner, whose “Beethoven” was last
year’s most important contribution to
musical comment, after examining all
the available evidence (not least of this
the Berlioz scores) has produced a Life
of the composer the avowed object of
which is to give Berlioz his rightful place
as the greatest composer since Beethoven.
Turner nails down once and for all the
canard that the musical education of the
composer of “The Damnation of Faust”
was in any way lacking. Berlioz could
sing at sight and play the flageolet and
the flute at the age of 12. He commenced
composing before the age of 15 (accord-
ing to modern ideas the best preparation
for a study of theory), studied in Paris
under Lesuer and Reicha from his nine-
teenth till his twenty-seventh year and
wound up by winning the Grand Prix
de Rome of the Paris Conservatoire. He
reckoned his inability to use the piano-
forte as an advantage, as it compelled
him to compose in silence. (Beethoven’s
greatest work was produced after he was
totally deaf.)
Though tremendously emotional, Ber-
lioz wasn’t a weakling. He usually got
what he wanted. Than his infatuation
for the actress Harriet Smithson there
seemed, as the lady herself informed him,
“nothing more impossible,” but four
years after she said that she married him!
It wasn’t a successful marriage. Ber-
lioz was ever more in love with love
than with women, and, though he didn’t
quite realise it, more interested in the
musical expression of his emotions than
in the objects that called them forth.
Chopin, Mendelssohn, Wagner, Liszt
and Meyerbeer, the younger Dumas,
Gautier, Flaubert and Murger were his
contemporaries and, if not his intimates,
his friends. Mendelssohn could see no
talent, let alone genius, in the work of
the young Frenchman, but admitted him
to be a sound critic and conductor, and
exchanged batons with him, Wagner,
though a bit jealous of the Abbe’s high
opinion of Berlioz, had a fellow-feeling
for a doughty battler. Chopin found
Hector, to most others cold and dour,
a cheerful, jolly companion. The literary
men treated him as an equal in their
own craft.
The musical faith of Berlioz may oe
summed up in his declaration that music
must be free. It is only in recent years,
after contemplating the struggles of
Schonberg, Ornstern, Scriabin, Stravin-
sky and others to give greater liberty to
musical expression, that it has been
realised that that battle had been already
waged—and very largely won—by Ber-
lioz. Turner says, in effect, that there is
more musical meat in any six bars of
Berlioz than in many a six pages of
Wagner, and that is not an overstate-
ment. From now on, it appears, the
French iconoclast is to be recognised.
The 8.8. C. has commenced to perform
his works. Sir Thomas Beecham has
promised a performance of “Les
Troyens,” last and greatest of the Ber-
lioz operas, next year. Mr. Turner’s
work comes at an opportune time.

Giving the
once-over to the
new pictures in
Melb. National
Gallery acquired
by the Felton
Bequest is sadly reminiscent of the rem-
nant counter after the summer sale.
They are a weirdly-mixed lot; the most
interesting, one that buyers evidently
set little store on —a bold composition
by Jacob Jordaens, powerful and full of
action. The Ribera, purchase of which
was loudly trumpeted, shows the usual
chalky-white figure standing out in the
spotlight before a sombre background.
The De Gelder is notable mostly for the
gleaming dagger which shines out of the
canvas like a lightning flash, but far
better painting is revealed in the silver
ornaments. As for the figures, they also
ran. Lely’s “Duchess of Newcastle” once
again follows slavishly eighteenth-century
conventions, showing a pink-and-white
miss simpering out of a mass of curls
and advertising somebody’s satin. The
moderns command more interest —two
vigorously painted Russian
scenes by Constantin West-
chikott. If diversity was
sought, the buyers have
certainly achieved a
triumph.
Melb. Fine Arts’ Society
is showing a mixed grill of
35 pictures from 11 differ-
ent artists. It is an inter-
esting exhibition, though
many of the pictures have
been seen previously, not-
ably Rex Batterbee’s color-
ful scenes of Central Aus-
tralia. Streeton and Her-
bert have only one exhibit
each, excellent examples.
Louis McCubbin is shown
in both oil- and water-
color, his Trawool draw-
ings being gems of their
sort. Murray Griffin, best
known for his remarkable
lino-cuts, experiments in
massed color, successfully
in “Show Patterns,” unsuccessfully in
“Summer Day.” E. Buckmaster con-
tributes three landscapes, the best un-
catalogued ; and other landscapes are
shown by Charles Wheeler, Robert John-
son, Victor Zelman, John Rowell and
Harry Harrison.
Leslie Bowles has won the Melbourne
City Council competition for sculpture
to decorate the Fitzroy Gardens. A
competition held by a municipal council
does not, on the face of it, inspire any
particular degree of confidence; but,
strangely enough, little fault can be
found with the judgment on this occa-
sion. Bowles’s winning design—two
groups to flank a stairway, one revealing
a youth struggling with a python, the
other Pan holding back a billygoat—are
unquestionably the best of the good lot
submitted. Bowles contributes an alter-
native stairway set, little inferior to the
winners, and a straight statue, “A Seaside
Diana.” Paul Montford, who never does
bad work, exhibits a delightful dancing
pair, better finished probably than
Bowles’s winning design, but more con-
ventional in treatment. Ola Cohn gives
the one note of modernism in her “Spirit
of the Bush,” but has kept the soft pedal
on, possibly fearsome of the municipal
mind, in her other excellent works. Wal-
lace Anderson, who turned out that re-
markable Digger statue which stands in
the War Museum, tried with three or
four well-modelled pieces, and other ex-
hibitors worth mention are Geo. H.
Allen, Orlando Dutton and Chas. Oliver.
The collection is a good one, but, seeing
what is being done in other parts of
the world, it would have been refresh-
ing to find Australian sculptors breaking
away further from tradition and taking
more chances.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The Girl Guides had a busy few days
with Lady Baden-Powell in our midst,
and her two daughters. The Baden-
Powell girls must get rather tired of
Guide functions, which give them little
time to see the countries through which
they travel.
The marriage of Mary Eileen, daugh-
ter of the Harrison Bourkes, Tranmere,
to Patrick McMahon Glynn, of Din-
ninup (W.A.), drew a large crowd to the
monastery chapel at Glen Osmond. The
bride wore white satin and one of the
new veils with the tulle arranged to
fall in three tiers. Mrs. R. Isenstein,
as matron of honor, and bridesmaids
Monica Bourke and Dymphna Glynn
were frocked alike in ice-blue chiffon,
worn with large straw hats in the same
shade. After the ceremony there was a
reception at the home of the bride’s
parents at Tranmere.
Mrs. W. T. Ikan and her family left
in the Westralia for Sydney, where they
will spend a few days before going on
to M.L., their future home. Mr. Ikan
was transferred some months ago from
the Adelaide branch of the A.M.P. There
have been many parties in their honor.
Ethel Leahy, who leaves shortly for
London to marry Flight-Lieut. Lawrie
Spencer, was given a farewell dinner
party at the Southern Cross.
There will be some society weddings
in February. Elizabeth Randell is to
become Mrs. Keith Forwood on the sth,
Joan Jessop and Ronald Fox are to ex-
change vows on the 14th, and Victoria
Edmunds and Dr. Douglas McKay have
a tryst for the 23rd. There is a growing
fancy for getting married at the little
Church of Epiphany at Crafers, which
means that all the guests have to motor
out.
Mrs. John Baker was hostess at an
afternoon-tea party qt her home at
Mount Lofty, a welcome to Lily and
Eva Waite, who recently returned from
abroad.
Adelaide is wondering if it has some-
thing unusual in the young contralto
Margaret Pirie. She has glowing
opinions from Schwab, Mme. Delmar
Hall and Mrs. James Dyer ; and Lady
Weigall has promised to sponsor her in
London.
WESTRALIA.
Hunt Club members risked the weather
and arranged a dance as their first ’35
activity. The mercury soared, but as
the venue was the Freshwater Bay Yacht
Club no one seemed to mind, though the
sitting-out accommodation in the cool
of the balconies was somewhat taxed.
Flowers in the club colors were massed
on the supper tables in the slips, where
Mrs. T. Felloe’s snowy laces occupied
the presidential chair. Secretary Molly
McEnroe’s georgettes were patterned in
brown and white; Mrs. A. E. Joyner
frothed misty-blue laces; Mrs. Dave
Freecorn’s black taffetas rustled musi-
cally ; a garden of roses grew on Doris
Colliver’s white georgettes ; Molly Man-
ning swished a length of jade-green taf-
feta ; Mrs. Victor lent a touch of color
with Vatican red lace; and Vera Mc-
Enroe spilled silver lame on her blush-
pink crepes.
News from Colombo tells of the wed-
ding, at St. Peter’s (Garrison) Church, of
Alexander Mair and the Guildford A.
F. Sandersons’ daughter Edith. Bridal
white nets cascaded into a train under the
mist of a tulle veil which billowed
around the sheaf of Madonna lilies.
Sister Pat Sanderson brought up the rear
with exotic orchids to the fore and a
train of celanese crepe aft. Bride’s sister
and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. L.
Mathews, staged the feasting at their
home, Lulworth.
Molly and Rita McGibbon started
their just-back-from-England hospitality
with a bridge party. Roses and more roses
bloomed in the lounges and balcony, and
tea in the dining-room was fragrant with
their perfume. Molly’s beige laces hung
in intriguing killings, and Rita’s ivory
silks were patterned with black.
Adeline Robertson was a symphony
in blue for her tryst with Roland Parker
at St. George’s Cathedral. Azure-blue
satin started at her throat, fell gracefully
over her shoulders, left her back bare,
then continued its journey to her ankles,
and trailed for some yards on the
ground. A plait of her golden hair was
the foundation for her halo of orange-
blossom, the peak point of the cloud
of blue tulle which billowed to the edge
of the train at the back, and fell over her
muff of orange-blossom in front. Matron
of honor Mrs. Chapman balanced her
basket of forget-me-nots on her left arm,
and tucked a blue satin cushion for the
bride under her right. Her deep cream
matt crepes were tied with a bow at
the back of the knees.
The international tennis-players arrived
at Fremantle on their homeward-bound
journey with never a soul to greet them.
A telephone call from Pat Hughes to
W.A.L.T.A. president S. J. McGibbon
started the wires burning, and a hastily
organised series of calls per telephone
and wireless resulted in some 500 en-
thusiasts arriving at King’s Park in time
to watch exhibition matches.
The Kylie Music Club’s scheme of
giving programmes on Saturday after-
noons at the Karrakatta Club has proved
a popular one. The club’s first effort for
the year found Roy Agnew on the plat-
form, and his rendering of his own com-
positions evoked considerable enthusiasm.
Wieniawski’s “Polonaise” flowed melliflu-
ously from William Glassford’s fiddle;
Marian Mendelssohn and John Lenegan
lifted their voices in song, and Mrs. Wil-
son and Kit Sherlock gave two-piano
numbers.
TASMANIA.
The Lyceum Club ran an at-home to
welcome the Snowden lady, and the big
double drawing-room was crammed for
the occasion. The Governor’s wife, the
Nicholls lady and Mrs. Stourton, presi-
dent of the club, sat in the seats of the
mighty with the guest, who was presented
with innumerable bouquets, one being
tied with her late husband’s racing colors.
Music and tea followed speeches.
Mrs. C. R. Davies engineered a very
jolly party for daughter Pat’s 21st birth-
day, commencing with dinner at Had-
ley s and winding up with dancing at
the Imperial. The hostess’s frock was or
black chiffon velvet, and the just-enfran-
chised voter sported a long, straight
white satin frock with black stripes on
the upper part of the bodice,
Sheila Headlam, Bellerive, and R. B.
Hale, New Norfolk, were made one at
St. George’s, Battery Point. The bride
suited her tailored rig to her dark hair,
and looked well in it. Joan Cotton
’maided in navy blue, and the party were
entertained at supper by the bride's
mother, Mrs. David Headlam.
Evelyn Douglas became Mrs. Gordon
Dodery at St. John’s, Launceston. The
church was a mass of blue and pink
hydrangeas. The bride’s frock of del-
phmium-blue crepe de Chine had frills
on shoulders and skirt, and her hat of
tagel straw was of the same shade, with
a metal and blue quill.
The Premier had a stroke of bad luck
in the motor accident which broke his
nose and laid him up for a time. His
secretary, Mr. Smith, got a broken leg
for his share, and will be away from his
work for many v\eeks.

Ex. Commander Beatty, who filled the
gap left by Captain Matheson’s depar-
ture, has sailed for England on the Mon-

poured tea for a big crowd of friends
at Hadley’s, wearing a checked frock of
crepe de Chine in two shades of blue.

Humor Story Entry:-
The IDLE
BUDDER
By Harry Paull.
Illustrations by Aria
THE Reverend Arthur Pindar ushered
his early-morning caller in and
bade her be at ease. She was a
little lady of uncertain age, and was obvi-
ously in a state of nervous excitement.
Mr. Pindar, who had a weakness for
whippet-racing, likened her to a whippet
straining upon the leash. When she had
settled herself comfortably in a chair
he looked towards her.
“Now, madam, let me have your
trouble.”
The woman drew a deep breath.
“You don’t know me as well as you
should, Mr. Pindar, more shame to me
for not coming to church for many years
until yesterday. My
name is Annie
Timms, and my hus-
band has the little
grocery shop at the
corner of Lyons-
street. Here we’ve
been, man and wife,
for twenty - seven
years, happy, not as
larks, but as decent
couples may be in
marriage, only to be
parted now by an
Idle Budder.”
“An Idle Budder?”
interrogated
Mr. Pindar. “But,
never mind, con-
tinue.”
“An Idle Budder?” interrogated Mr.
Pindar. “But, never mind, continue.”
“Last Saturday afternoon, the shop
being closed, Henry went out for his
usual constitutional and came home for
tea as is customary. Of late months I
have known that there was a secret on
his mind. Sometimes he’d come home
pleasant and sometimes gloomy, ready
to bite my head off. But never would he
admit any cause for this moodiness, only
getting restless if I mentioned it, and
I bore with his moods uncomplainingly.
On Saturday, as he sat down for his tea,
he pulled from a pocket a certain thing
which he said he had picked up down
on the Lincoln Reserve. It is only about
two inches high, being jade or ebony,
and highly polished, and a more perfect
piece of workmanship I never did see.
It is a miniature of some heathen god
which, I understand, is a Budder.”
“One moment!” cried Mr. Pindar. “A
heathen god, you say—jade or ebony.
The former, I should imagine. From
your description, Mrs. Timms, I should
say it is an Eastern god.”
“Which heathens worship?” asked
Mrs. Timms gloomily.
“I’m afraid they do.”
“Well, Henry put it down on the table-
cloth and told me he meant to keep it
in case a reward was offered in Monday’s
papers. ‘lt may be very valuable,’ he
said.
«TINSUSPICIOUS, I began to examine
U the Idle, when I suddenly realised
that men and women
Have been murdered
in their beds by
heathens seeking
such Idles which
have been stole from
temples. After some
argument, during
which many such
examples as read by
me flashed into my
mind, I told Henry
to throw the Idle
away or else take it
to the police station.
But he refused, be-
ing greedy for the
reward. After more
argument, the even-
ing passed, and we
went to bed, me making him lock the
bedroom door.
“But with a vision of that little black
Idle staring down from the parlor mantel-
shelf haunting me, I didn’t sleep till the
early-morning hours. When I woke it
was past nine o’clock, and Henry had
made a cup of tea. It was now my belief,
from intuitions in which I believe, that
the Idle Budder wasn’t lost at all.”
“But your husband”
“Not lost, Mr. Pindar,” she said
tensely. “But chucked away !”
“Ohl” The minister subsided.
“Chucked away by a person fearful
of the heathens being on the trail, and,
what with Henry sneeringly bringing
Chinamen into the conversation, I fairly
shrieked. If there’s one thing worse
than heathen black men it’s Chinese
Secret Tongs which draw lots to murder
regardless of consequence. Look what
Sax Rohmer has told us, and look at
the Pigtail of somebody in the recita-
tion! So I went to church, feeling that
a cleansing in a Christian house of wor-
ship might be the only thing that would
save murder. Henry wouldn’t come, and
1 left him reading a book right under
[that awful Idle, which he forbade me
to touch, being afraid, as I then thought,
that I’d throw it away.
“Until I returned from church my
heart held no suspicions of Henry, be-
yond his strange moods on Saturdays,
believing him simply blinded by greed
of a reward. I came home praying that
nothing had happened. But when I
opened the parlor door what did I find?”
said. Mr. Pindar, with
deep interest. “What was it?”
“I found Henry down on his knees
on the hearthrug before that Idle
Budder! Yes, my husband, supposedly
a Christian man and a respectable grocer,
was there bowing before a heathen Idle!
My blood froze.
I up and tackled
him. A great
show the poor
wretch made of
hi s innocence,
saying he was
looking for a
hairpin he’d
dropped which he
used for cleaning
his pipe. And
nothing would
shake him, though
I warned him of
the wrath of God
“Yes, my husband, supposedly a
Christian man and a respectable
grocer, was there bowing”....
if he was lying. At last he threatened
to strike me if I didn’t close my trap,
those being his words. I closed my trap,
nor did I open it again, keeping to the
bedroom while he held the parlor and
his Idle Budder.
“Then, in the evening, after drinking
one cup of tea, I went off to church again.
And when I got home afterwards, pre-
pared for a heart-to-heart talk, what do
I see as I neared the house but a Chinese
laundryman handing Henry an envelope
at the side door, and sneaking away in
a hurry immediately he saw me.
“Down I dropped in a faint, as well
I might. When I came to I was lying
on my bed, with Henry blowing water
in my nose. I struggled up and accused
him of getting a note, and I said to
Henry these very words:
“ ‘Are you,’ I said, ‘a heathen Idle-
worshipper and a lost man from choice,
or are you worshipping that Idle Budder
for fear of the murdering heathens? It’s
plain,’ I said, ‘that that Chinaman Wing
Lee is a messenger of a Tong. What
was in that note? And if you give up
bowing before that black devil on the
mantelpiece I’ll stand by you till death do
us part.’ ”
“And what did your husband say to
that?” asked Mr. Pindar.
“In all the years I’ve known Henry I’ve
never seen him so annoyed and upset.
He scowled at me, and shuffled his feet.
He swore. Then he shook his fists in
the air, and said I could have it straight.
Wing Lee, he said, was giving him his
yesterday’s winnings on the races, the
Chinaman being a sort of secret agent
for a man called S. P. Bookie, Henry
said he was standing at the side door,
deep-breathing, when Wing Lee passed,
having just come from S. P. Bookie’s
place collecting settlements, and, Henry
being there and me being out, he had
given him the money instead of waiting
till to-day.
gouch was Henry’s miserable story,
and not a word did I believe, for
Henry never gambles. Henry showed me
money, but didn’t he have the weekly
shop takings in his possession? It was
all up on Saturday for the first time in
his life, he said, and since I knew now
he told me to go ahead and roar my
head off.”
“Good heavens! ” muttered Mr. Pindar.
“All up!” said Mrs. Timms. “I told
him it was all up the minute he brought
the Idle Budder into the house. For
weeks I had seen a change coming over
him, sometimes brooding all over the
house, sometimes smiling and sometimes
absent-minded. And
so I told him. No
longer did I fear the
vengeance of the Idle
Budder heathens. Will-
ingly, of his own
accord, Henry had
brought that abomina-
tion into the house.
Why wouldn’t he let me
touch it? Because I’d
throw it away? No!
Because I’d contami-
nate the thing with my
Christian hands! All
his long rigmarole
about Mr. S. P. Bookie and Rajah fell
on deaf ears as lies I couldn’t properly
follow. Even bringing an Indian Prince
into his explanation, such men generally
being at the head of secret societies, I
locked myself in the bedroom and left
him alone to his Idle and the spare
blankets on the couch.
“In the morning, while I was getting
the breakfast, he went out to buy the
three morning papers, and presently he
came back and told me nobody hadn’t
advertised for the Idle.
“Handing Henry an envelope at the side
door, and sneaking away.”

The First Railway
in Australia
The first railway in Australia was completed in
1854 and linked Melbourne with Sandridge (Port
Melbourne), a distance of two and a quarter miles.
At the present there are in Australia nearly 27,000
miles of railways.
When this first railway was opened the Bank of
New South Wales had been in existence in
Sydney for 37 years and had established branch
offices in Melbourne and elsewhere.
Just as the railway has developed trade by open-
ing up wider markets and facilitating the disposal
of goods, so the Bank has provided those financial
facilities without which the exchange of goods and
services could not have expanded.
The Bank of New South Wales has continually
fostered the development of new areas throughout
Australia, and has often pioneered the way for
further railway extension.
It is the largest bank in the Southern Hemisphere
and has over 720 branches throughout Australia,
New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.

“ ‘Nor ever will,’ I said cuttingly, ‘and
well you know it. It was only your
scheme to get the Idle into the house.’
“Then, according to my decision, I up
and said, ‘Henry, these are my final
words. Either that Idle Budder leaves
this house immediately or I leave.
Choose between your Christian wife and
your murderous heathens.’
“With that he went off bang, and
shook his fist in my face. He wouldn’t
give in to no woman’s foolishness, not
for nothing, he said. He didn’t worship
no heathen Budders, and he wasn’t
frightened, he said, of all the Chows and
niggers on the earth. What was more,
he said, that Idle Budder had brought
him luck, Saturday being the first time
he’d succeeded all up in his life, and he
wouldn’t part with it for no fool-woman.
“Such was his language to his lawful
wife! Upon which I put on my hat and
come round to see you, wondering if
a Christian minister might intervene to
save Henry’s soul.”
“I certainly shall!” exclaimed Mr.
Pindar. “Your story
has intrigued me be-
yond measure, Mrs.
Timms. It is sad,
though, of course,
there are things in it

later, with Mrs.

had been severely shaken over the week-
end, and he was prepared for war.
Mr. Pindar, however, smiled pacifi-
cally.
“Mrs. Timms,” he said, “will you mind
if I speak to your husband alone?”
She frowned, but, having pinned her
last hope on the Church, sulkily walked
through the shop to the bedroom. Mr.
Pindar coughed.
“Mr. Timms, pray, do not think I am
wantonly interfering. I’d rather you
understand that I have my duty to do
as a spiritual father to my flock. What
is this extraordinary story of your fall
from grace so far as to worship heathen
idols?”
“The plain facts I know, and the plain
facts I’ll give you,” said the grocer
angrily. “My missus hates gambling, and
for months now I’ve been secretly hav-
ing a little bet or two on a Saturday
afternoon. I got to have some relaxa-
tion. What she didn’t know she didn’t
grieve over —or roar about either, which
was what I was trying to avoid.
“Last Saturday I was crossing the
grass reserve at Lincoln-square when I
picked up a little black Idle. It’s a nice
shiny little thing like a toy monument,
and I got to thinking that maybe it was
a punter’s omen. So I studied the starters
again for the races, and in one race I
found Rajah, and in the last race Indian
Prince. Here goes, I said. So I put
two bob on Rajah, all up Indian Prince,
the first at starting-price fours and the
second at sixes, and I had to collect
three-pun-ten in all.
“Circumstances, which, I suppose, that
crazy woman has told you upside down,
forced me to confess last night that I
was betting. Did she believe me? No!
She’s got some barmy notions that she’ll
be murdered in her bed, and that I’m a
heathen priest or some such thing in a
joss-house. She nearly drove me mad
on Saturday night with her stories. She
sees me picking up a hairpin, and says
I’m bowing to Idles. She sees an inno-
cent Chow passing me my dough on
the quiet, and says I’m in league with
things she calls Tongs!”
“But this idol?” said Mr. Pindar.
“Might I see it?”
Mr. Timms vanished
into the back regions
and returned to slide
the object over the
counter. Mr. Pindar
picked it up, blinked,
opened his mouth and
stared at the grocer.
“Mr. Timms,” he
said at length, “per-
haps someone has ad-
vertised for this after
all. Have you a morn-
ing paper handy?”
“Right here.” The
grocer produced a
newspaper. “But I’ve

rapidly down the applicable columns.
“Ah!” he said presently. “I thought so!
Read this!”
Mr. Timms craned his neck and read
slowly; -

good reward.
“Mean to say —mean to say this is a
chessman?” gasped the grocer.
“Haven’t you ever seen a set of chess-
men?”
“Never in my life!”
“This is the black bishop,” said the
minister. “I imagine it isn’t very valu-
able, from a cash standpoint, but as
part of a presentation set this man is
of undoubted value to its owner, who’ll
reward you well, I’m sure.”
Mr. Pindar coughed.
Mr. Timms fidgeted.
“Parson,” he said at length, “will you
oblige me by going inside and explain-
ing everything to my missus?”
“I’ll do my best,” said Mr. Pindar.
An Eternal Cycle
(In the Swinburne Manner )
Hope that is born of Desire,
Desire begotten of Need,
And Need that is Appetite’s child —
Through the pathway of flowers or the mire,
Immortal as Time’s very seed
Sown in Eternity’s wild,
They chain, whatever betide,
Each to the other complete,
Immune to the will or the heart.
None may draw them aside,
None may their purpose defeat
And none may tear them apart.
Desire whose offspring is Hope,
Need that gives birth to Desire,
And Appetite’s child who is Need;
Though in boldness or blindness we grope.
We pass through their flowers or fire
To judgment —guilty or freed.

A little while I would ask time to dream
Of Love I once held like a crimson rose,
Of Friendship, and of Passion and of Fate.
But roses die! And Friendship cannot wait;
It hurries on to where a fresh lamp glows.
And even Hate dies down, to where no gleam
Of fire flickers in the quiet ash.
And in a painted pageant all things pass,
The Knights and Ladies of the tournament,
Leaving us wondering why those bright gules
lent
Such glory to a shield! Breath on the glass!
The scented favor and the battle clash!
But this remains! Oh, sad, life-sated eyes!
A daffodil like flame amid the green
Shaped of God’s fingers! Sun on young grass
blades.
A bird song like a light in shadowy glades.
Wonder in children’s eyes; a river’s sheen
On purple hills; cloud tapestry of skies.

A throbbing star. White lilies, by a wall
Stained gold with gilly-flowers; a sudden strain
Of music with its old delicious pain.

For the few lovely things that still are mine!
Oh! world that robs us of our young content,
When I shall meet no more your adverse wind

My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
ENTER THE
CAREERISTS
Our party’s
dramatic success
at the election
had had its in-
evitable result on the personnel of the
annual conferences. A number of keen-
witted and enterprising people had begun
to see that a judicious measure of
prominence at these reunions was likely
to be an aid in the fight for political
advancement.
To win a seat it would be, in future,
merely necessary to be a Labor candi-
date. To become a candidate, however,
one must be selected. Selection was con-
ferred upon the well-advertised, and ad-
vertisement was to be gained by attend-
ing the conference and making a noise
there. At the annual conference of
1912 we encountered, for the first time
in any large numbers, the representatives
of a new element which steadily in-
creased in strength thereafter—gentle-
men who had been SO' recently converted
to our movement that they spoke its lan-
guage with difficulty, but who were con-
spicuous for a zeal whose fury was in
direct proportion to its freshness.
This conference was noteworthy chiefly
for two things. It expelled, or otherwise
severely dealt with, Dunn, the Labor man
whose resignation had caused so many
difficulties. I was, for some reason, not
present at the sitting which dealt with
him, and have forgotten the resolution’s
precise form. At the next sitting, how-
ever, we got the matter reopened. A
simple statement of the facts was made in
Dunn’s behalf. (My impression is that
this had not been done, and that the con-
ference, with the naive directness of the
early days, had gone to work on its de-
cision without any idea that it ought to
call beforehand on Dunn for his defence.)
This plain statement, as I have found so
often to be the case, did all that was
needed. The resolution was rescinded,
and Dunn’s promising political career,
which had just been peremptorily extin-
guished, was given a fresh start.
THE MACHINE
AT WORK
The other
memorable inci-
dent of the sit-
ing was a visit
of Fisher and Hughes, who, amid
scenes of considerable fervor, again ex-
plained that the movement towards an
industrial paradise would recommence
when the constitutional amendments were
carried.
A resolution was carried amid the re-
sulting enthusiasm altering the wording
of the pledge. We were to commit our-
selves in future when we accepted nomi-
nation as Labor candidates, not to the
platform, but to the “platforms” of the
party.
The avowed purpose of this was to
compel State members to accept to the
full the constitutional amendments next
time they came up.
That this was aimed at me primarily
was obvious, and although at this gather-
ing my personal prestige was such that
the ban was removed from Dunn on my
individual initiative, yet this hostile
measure was adopted by a considerable
majority. Such was the power of the
genuine enthusiasm of many of the older
warriors, plus the sham enthusiasm of
some of the newest.
To complete the disciplinary network
in which it was sought to enmesh recal-
citrants, a further resolution was carried
threatening with expulsion, or with other
severe penalties, all Labor men who
“failed to support” the referendum pro-
posals when next before the people!
Doubters like me were no longer to be
allowed the refuge of a profane silence.
Conference went on this year to pass
a series of resolutions in connection with
law matters. These were by arrange-
ment placed before me later on by the
executive of the league.
LAW REFORM
These aimed at,
first, an amend-
ment of the Jury
Act, simplification of procedure, or at
least of pleading and other preliminary
procedure, and an application of the
principles of the Judicature Act. These
1 accepted on behalf of the Government.
The matter of simplification of the
rules of evidence was also pressed. Here
nothing had been done or considered,
except in a very small way in connec-
tion with criminal law, but the present
state of the law of evidence could not be
described as a serious or general griev-
ance. Enlargement of the jurisdiction of
the District Courts would be aimed at
in any scheme of reform ultimately
adopted. I also offered to appoint a
royal commission to ascertain why liti-
gants do not resort to the Commercial
Court to-day.
“Direct appeal to the High Court of
Australia from the decisions of 'a jury”
(i.e., for new trial applications) I pro-
nounced to be a change “of a very doubt-
ful value,” and also the amalgamation of
the two branches of the legal profession.
LORD BRYCE
ARRIVES
There followed
certain social
hap p e nings in
these months
which helped to relax the ferocious in-
tensity of the situation.
Among the most interesting of these
was the only visit Lord Bryce ever made
to Australia. In Sydney it fell to my
lot to welcome him and to preside at
one or two entertainments given by the
Government in his honor.
Remarkable interest was aroused by
his visit. At a public reception which we
arranged at Parliament House some thou-
sands of citizens attended merely to have
the satisfaction of shaking hands with the
author of “The American Constitution.”
Our own Federal experiences had, of
course, secured a large number of Aus-
tralian readers for that masterpiece, but
apart altogether from that it was a real
satisfaction to most Australians to have
one of the foremost intelligences in the
Empire amongst us. I have no doubt
that the cordiality demonstrated on every
side did a good deal to induce the later
visits of a Parliamentary party and of
the British Association, by which, just
before the war, the mists of our intel-
lectual isolation were beginning to be dis-
persed.

PRAISES THIS
FAMOUS REMEDY
We publish this letter because it is so
obviously genuine, even without name;
a convincing picture of gratitude for
the sure effect of this new-principle
remedy—De Witt’s Antacid Powder.
13th June, 1934. Mosman, Sydney, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,
What users say of De Witt s Antacid
Powder is correct in every particular—l can
confirm it If any person has suffered more
intensely than I from inflamed, painful, dis-
tended stomach acid eructations (gas) and
from all those discomforting and heart-
breaking signs of a thoroughly disturbed
digestion, then I feel profoundly sorry for
that person. I bought your Powder because,
for one reason, I had already bought every-
thing else and, for another reason, because
the ingredients named onthe canister appeared
to offer something different—something with
possibilities of affording relief. They did, very
promptly, too, and that relief has been
sustained. To-day I am well—really well;
full of the joy of life and for the first time in
years hungry for my meals! I now take
De Witt’s Antacid Powder only after the
principle meal. Your preparation has not let
me down, and I do think I should register
public testimony of the virtue of at least one
proprietary medicine that can fill its claims
in full.
(Signed) Mr
De Witt’s Antacid Powder, with its
perfectly balanced formula of proven
ingredients to relieve stomach troubles,
is now bringing peace and happiness to
thousands of one-time sufferers in all
parts of the world.
DeWitt’s Antacid Powder neutralises
excess acidity, protects the inflamed
stomach linings from the hot, burning
acids, and actually digests a portion
of your food.
Gone for ever are those awful pains
caused by indigestion, flatulence, dys-
pepsia, gastritis, ulcerated stomach.
No more days spent in agony and
dreadful restless nights.
Why endure the pain and danger of
digestive troubles a day longer ? You
can get immediate relief and finally
rid yourself of your trouble entirely.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy ms
morning daily, so valuable is it for tne
information it gives, both in its news ana
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

Australian Representative:
W. J. HESLEHURST,
32 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, N.S.W,
congratulated the senate on keeping alive
the study of the humanities, contrasting
this attitude with the crass materialism
which prevailed in some American teach-
ing bodies. These observations were re-
ceived with considerable unction by some
of our university authorities, who had
not merely kept the humanities alive, but
had practically and efficiently done no-
thing else. I ventured upon pointing out
that our visitor, in stressing the value of
classical studies, was drawing a contrast
between them and certain modern evils
into which at present there was no
visible danger of our falling, and had
probably not fully realised the very slight
extent to which science and subjects
allied to science were pursued among us.
These comments, naturally enough,
were much resented by men who had
been conducting the university’s affairs
for a generation, and had the immediate
result of involving me in one of the
minor vortexes of the Science v. Classics
controversy, an experience which luckily
ended harmlessly. But up to that
moment, although the Labor movement
had accepted education as a watchword,
the acceptance had been a mere act of
faith, and no one had bothered as to the
kind of education we were to administer
when we came into power. The con-
troversy attracted attention throughout
our movement, and the claims made for
science constituted the earliest announce-
ment of a view which, taken up later on
by other Ministers, was destined to have
considerable practical results.
OTHER VISITORS
FROM ABROAD
Lord Harrowby
also visited us
then, and called
on me; but he
would take part in no public functions,
and it was not until I saw him later in
England that I discovered the wide
range of his interest in Australian affairs.
One of the most interesting happen-
ings of this date was the arrival of Cap-
tain Amundsen on his return from the
actual discovery of the South Pole.
Amundsen was not the first Polar ex-
plorer I had met, as it had been my good
fortune also at an earlier date to meet
Sir Ernest Shackleton on his way south.
Sir Ernest had returned to civilisation
either by another route or at some time
when I was not in Sydney, and there had
been no opportunity for
congratulatory festivities.
The Norwegian explorer, a
man of graver and less
buoyant type, probably
weighted down a little by
finding himself in a com-
munity of foreigners who
resolutely refused to speak
any language but their
own, was made a good
deal of by sympathetic
spirits, who appreciated the
heroism of his work.
We also had a visit from
Sir Kenneth Anderson, who
was entertained by the
local board of the P. and
O. Company on one of the
company’s ' steamers at a
lunch I attended on behalf
of the Government.
It fell to Sir Kenneth’s
Amundsen.
lot to propose the health
of the Ministry, which he did in
terms suggesting that he had been given
a fairly bad account of us. The gather-
ing was a thoroughly fashionable and
“representative” one, and offered an
opportunity for a brief but effective pro-
test against the steady misrepresentation
surrounding us. It had an excellent
result with many of my hearers, who
realised, I believe, the general justice of
my claims.
NEW CALEDONIAN
HOLIDAY
No New South
Wales Minister
can get a holiday
within his own
State, and by now I had thoroughly
assimilated this lesson. During this re-
cess accordingly I made another short
voyage away, this time to New Cale-
donia, where for the first time in my life
I made acquaintance with a real French
colony, finding it as different as possible
from Daudet’s sparkling sketch. Noumea,
the principal town, can be reached in
about three and a half days from Syd-
ney, and the journey, as I made it, left
me with some eight days on the island.
One can, it is true, get to Maoriland
by a similarly short run, and at Maori-
land there is wider range of attraction,
if one has three months to devote to a
systematic exploration of its glories. But
nowhere save New Caledonia can Aus-
tralians get so complete a change in so
brief a voyage. To the European who
can pass in a few hours into the juris-
diction of a new Government and the
realm of a new language, it is difficult to
picture the inescapably sameness of Aus-
tralia, in which one can travel three thou-

sand miles and
find precisely
the same condi-
tions at each
end of the jour-
ney.
Going to New
Caledonia is like i
passing into a
new world. One
strikes there the
real charm of
the tropical
Pacific and the ■
inexhaustible in-
terest of French
affairs. The
Australian see-
ing the world
generally runs
in a British
steamer which
stops at none
but British ports, at least as far
as Naples, and lives while on board
under the protection of the British
Constitution amid a sound Anglo-Saxon
odor of burning fat'. But on this short
jaunt the unusual methods of living, the
tropical habits and the constant pres-
ence of the more picturesque side of mili-
tarism make up an ensemble which 1
found irresistibly attractive after the utili-
tarianism and the easy-going sports of
New South Wales life.
During my stay I made the acquaintance
of Monsieur Brunet, the Governor, an
ideal representative of enlightened French
officialdom, and most of the higher civil
and military officers of the colony, and
was fortunate enough to lay the founda-
tion of many relationships which have
never varied since.
PENAL SYSTEM
New Caledonia
was still a large
penal settlement.
Although actual transportation from
France had ceased for some years, there
were several thousands of prisoners
still there. They were all men who
had been guilty of serious offences,
and sentenced originally to transporta
tion for life. They gained by good
conduct large remission of their sen-
tences, and were ultimately discharged
on a kind of ticket-of-leave
which admitted them
to the status of liberes.
They were then provided
with allotments in the in-
terior of the island, and
aided in various ways by
the Government, and were,
it was hoped, gradually to
become a prosperous farm-
ing population. The scheme
on the whole was well con-
cei v e d and thoroughly
humanitarian. Some doubts
were expressed to me while
I was there by Monsieur
Carbouillet, the Controller-
General, as to whether the
released convict would
make a satisfactory farmer.
Sometimes, no doubt, the
transitions were altogether
too sudden. On the other
hand, in many cases the
scheme worked well.
AMONG THE
LIBERES
As a Minister
for Justice from
one of the Aus-
tralian States, 1
was made free of the whole system.
I visited the island just outside the
harbor on which is to be found the
principal prison building (He Nou) and
was taken by the chief of the Administra-
tion into the interior in order to see the
arrangements made for the liberes and
their families, the schools, hospitals,
roads and other works of civilisation.
The roads were still backward, and
members of the council strongly con-
demned certain Parisian influences which
vetoed anything like adequate taxation
of the wealthy nickel-mines of the island
to raise a fund for road building. Rail-
way construction also struck me —fresh
from the desperate efforts of our own
Government—as slack. On the other
hand, the land laws seemed to be effec-
tive and good. The extraordinary fer-
tility of the country made every settler
appear prosperous and the prospects of
the next generation seemed excellent.
One other point is of sufficient interest
to recall here. I found that in the prison
dark cells were still in use, and that in
these refractory prisoners could be
locked as a punishment for definite
periods. This seemed so much out of
keeping with the general spirit of the
prison system that I ventured later on
to make representations to the French
Government about it.

of Papua takes the reader first pearling on the North Australian
grounds and then into a series of excitements while the leading
characters are wandering amidst hostile and tnenaly tribes
through the heart of Papua. The adventures are not imaginary.
Commander Brewster bases them on life experiences, making
of them a lively narrative, touched with humor. Pearls of Papua
can be heartily recommended as a wholesome, stirring tale that
any boy will joy to have as a gift.
